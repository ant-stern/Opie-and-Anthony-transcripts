<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a lengthy discussion centered around the premiere episode of the final season of *Lost*. Opie detailed his last-minute, month-long marathon to watch the entire series before the premiere, contrasting his experience with the upcoming *Jersey Shore* marathon.  He jokingly suggested one of the *Jersey Shore* cast members deserved a punch after recounting a bar fight depicted on the show.  The hosts contrasted the "high-brow" viewing options of  *Band of Brothers* and Ken Burns' *Civil War* with the perceived low-brow nature of *Jersey Shore*.

Anthony then recounted his near-disastrous attempt to host a *Lost* premiere viewing party in a theater, narrowly avoiding a complete power failure. The conversation then veered to a 3D remake of "We Are the World," which they mocked for its unnecessary use of 3D technology.  Returning to *Lost*, Anthony initially boasted about accurately predicting plot points, only to later admit to being surprised by several plot twists.  The hosts provided a running critique of the show's special effects, wigs, and the noticeable presence of extra actors. They mentioned that Claire, a *Lost* character, had previously been a guest on their show.

A significant portion of the segment involved detailed discussion and speculation on various plot points and characters from the *Lost* premiere, including the location and motivations of certain characters.  The poor quality of the show's special effects, particularly an underwater scene, was repeatedly criticized.  They gave the episode ratings ranging from 3 to 4 stars and debated whether the show would end with a traditional series finale or transition into a movie.  The hosts also discussed the premiere's ratings and DVR viewership, speculating on the absence of certain characters and the potential reasons behind it. The show concluded with further speculation about the future of *Lost*.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I believe we put on a fine show every day, but let's not be mistaken, we are the dumbest  guys in radio.  Ew, it's Opie and Anthony, this place stops. 
[00:00:30]  There's no mistake about it, we are the dumbest guys in broadcasting.  Anybody that doesn't appreciate this radio show can go and kill yourself.  Kill yourself.  What will happen today?  I can't believe anyone is still listening to this show.  Oh, you want me to fuck your dick?  Do you get it?  One girl's probably my balls smell like a ham and monster on wheat.  I'm gonna sneak your crumbs so good.  This is gonna be another stupid show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning.  Hi everybody. 
[00:01:00]  Hi.  I guess there was a big TV show on last night.  Well, I got myself in a predicament.  Yeah, you're in a pickle.  Because I've announced that I'll be the last man alive to never have seen Lost.  And I'm just hurting myself, I guess.  Yeah.  Because the more and more I hear about this fine show, I'm like, why am I not watching it?  Why?  But now it's up to the point.  How many seasons?  Six seasons?  Yeah.  This is the sixth of last season.  And I started doing the math. 
[00:01:30]  It would take me like a month of just constant viewing to catch up.  Yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  You would have to do a giant marathon.  Giant marathon?  Yeah.  During a time off where you just go on to Netflix.  The average TV marathon is what?  Three days?  A nice weekend?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, like if you're watching, you know, you could cover something like Band of Brothers  on an entire Sunday.  How great is that?  Something like that.  How great is that?  I love when that, you know, you just fucking love it.  When you find something that you can marathon with. 
[00:02:00]  Who turned us on to the TV marathon?  I did.  You did?  Thank you, Jimmy.  Thank you.  I think it was the real world marathon.  Yeah.  It was the first.  First, like, marathon.  But that put the thought in all of our heads.  I know we're going to talk about Lost in a second.  I just want to talk for a couple minutes and then I'll just sit back and make videos or something  for an hour because I'm so out of the conversation that's about to begin.  But my point, it put the marathon thought in all our heads and then you start doing your  own marathons.  Like you just said Band of Brothers or whatever. 
[00:02:30]  The Lost Marathon, though.  There's no way.  Like maybe, what's his name?  The documentary on the Civil War that Ken Burns put out.  That's a good marathon to do if you want to throw in a bunch of those discs or something.  Well, they're going to do a Jersey Shore marathon, I guess, this Sunday.  Super Bowl Sunday.  That's what MTV's doing.  Isn't that correct?  I bring up Band of Brothers and Ken Burns' Civil War and you bring up Jersey Shore.  Put in that category, one of these things is not like the other. 
[00:03:00]  But I was right there with you.  I was thinking what a waste of fucking time this Jersey Shore marathon is.  That show fell a fucking part and no one is willing to admit that.  It really did.  The first few episodes are like, wow.  And then you realize these dummies have nothing really to offer and it's just the same shit  week after week.  It was the big punch that fucking made everybody go like, holy shit.  I got to check this out.  I got to see this.  You know, then the little peripheral stuff that was going on, but that punch in the bar 
[00:03:30]  was like the clincher.  And you know what?  It's kind of a Chris Rock thing.  You can't understand.  You know the famous Chris Rock line?  Yeah, yeah.  If you watch enough of that...  I wouldn't do it, but I understand.  If you watch enough of that Snooki, you kind of understand how some guy could have just  fucking hauled off...  I personally don't punch fucking broads, but you kind of understand why she deserved a  fist sandwich.  I would never do it, but you have my blessing.  Right. 
[00:04:00]  Anyway, of course, it's all about loss today, Anthony.  You were very excited.  And we need an update.  Did you get the theater together before?  Yes.  The big loss premiere.  Just in a nick of time, I went down into the control room, went down into master control,  and had to bypass the uninterrupted power supply, because apparently it interrupted.  Well, then why is it called the uninterrupted power supply? 
[00:04:30]  I don't know, but the manufacturer has told the installer that, yeah, we've been having  problems with those things.  Oh, good.  Oh, great.  Great.  Those are there, so if the lights go out or something, if the power goes out, you're still  good for a little bit, and shit's not just going to cut off and surge and things like  that.  But how do they call it the uninterrupted power?  It should never interrupt the entire system.  They might have to rename that.  But it did.  The sometimes.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:05:00]  Or just when you need it.  Just when you need it, it will be interrupted power supply.  Yeah, so I bypassed that thing, and the lights, bells, and whistles came on, and everything  started working.  Good.  That was good.  That was good.  Watched it on the big, giant movie screen.  I really wanted your lost party interrupted with a nice flash fire.  No!  Is your screen high def?  Yeah, yeah.  3D capability?  I don't think 3D capable.  Why not?  With wacky glasses, maybe?  I don't know.  It all depends on how they put these movies out. 
[00:05:30]  I don't know if wacky glasses, 3D that they do on TV, like now for commercials occasionally,  or 3D like Avatar.  I don't know.  Well, I curse James Cameron and Avatar today, too, because every other article you read  about pop culture, it has to be in 3D now.  You know, they redid the We Are The World, and we didn't give a shit on this show, the  25th anniversary.  I guess they're doing it for Haiti, which is a nice thing, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,  blah, blah.  But then it came out yesterday, they had to do it in 3D. 
[00:06:00]  Why?  Exactly.  What is the difference?  Not everything has to be in 3D just because of this Avatar.  If they're just standing there.  They filmed it in 3D.  And singing, it's got to be in 3D?  Yeah.  So you can see singers spit flying out of their mouth.  I don't know why.  Did they get the same people?  We'll have to look into it.  I didn't really pay attention.  I want the lineup, if the guys could get it.  Yeah.  Because I'm sure there's a major drop-off.  I'm sure there's a drop-off in the original song, too.  Yeah.  There's some of those people in the video. 
[00:06:30]  You're like, who is that?  Wait, I'm not...  Is that Kenny Loggins?  I see that's Bruce Springsteen and Bono.  Yeah.  Oh, that's Cindy Lauper.  And then there's some people, you're like, eh.  There's someone...  Like the backup singers to Bananarama or something?  Yeah, I think Bananarama might have been in there.  The article I read said that not a single person from the original is in the new one.  Oh, that's good.  But didn't...  That's a show of support.  Isn't Lionel Richie part of this, though?  They actually...  It wasn't him.  It's his Clay Head from the Hello video.  They just popped that up on a mic stand. 
[00:07:00]  But they had a film in a 3D.  Clay Head.  Getting back...  So you got the theater...  Yeah, I got that up and running.  Up and running.  Good.  Had some people over.  And then the first hour, of course, 8 to 9 Eastern.  By the way, there's going to be some spoilers, obviously.  No, no.  I'm going to try to keep spoilers to an absolute minimum.  I'm not going to...  I'm not going to give anybody any info.  This is a DVR world, and I know there's probably a bunch of people that still haven't seen it.  I will not...  I will talk in terms that if people saw it, they will understand. 
[00:07:30]  If they didn't, it won't ruin anything.  Can you talk about Lost in that dumb language James Cameron came up with?  I have not seen the movie yet, so I cannot speak the Pandora language.  I don't know what that is.  Everything's okay in the end.  I'll do the entire break, though, in Klingon.  Okay, that's good.  Shut up, fucking nerds.  I just want to punch them at those conventions, speaking in Klingon.  Do guys do that? 
[00:08:00]  Yes, they do.  No, they don't.  They speak in Klingonese.  Yes, they do.  It sounds like they just want to say cock.  They do.  They always just want to say cock.  They just come short of saying cock.  Cock means fire.  Cock means fuck you, Kirk.  Cock.  Oh, there you go.  Sal and Westchester.  I'm sorry.  Hello!  We are the...  We are the world that has to be in 3D, so you can see Lady Gaga's huge clitoris.  Oh, it comes out at you.  You're actually reaching out, trying to touch her dick-like clit. 
[00:08:30]  Let's look at the statue on the Lost Island.  See, I want to laugh.  I don't know what that is.  That's a good one.  That's a good one?  Yeah.  Just let me know if they're good ones.  Do we have a guy actually speaking Klingonese?  Really?  All right, we'll find one.  Yeah, I have to hear that now because it really is bad.  So was it an all-out party?  Was it a...  No, no, it was a...  A viewing party different than a weekend party for you?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's fucking...  It's a weekday.  Do you have different, like, parties? 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, yeah.  A weekend party is crazy.  Name all the parties you have.  You have the viewing party.  There's, yeah.  There's week...  Well, actually, it's not just viewing.  There's weekday parties.  Weekday parties?  Then there's weekend parties.  Ooh.  Are they different?  Yeah.  The weekday parties, you need some...  Some form of responsibility.  I mean, even a little bit.  But who's the person that is responsible?  Because it's certainly not you, my friend.  That would be me.  Come on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:09:30]  How do you do that?  I have to look and go, all right, loss wraps up at 11 tonight.  Yeah.  I got to fucking, you know, get to bed by 1130.  Okay.  And, you know, have an adequate nap beforehand.  You got to do that.  Weekend parties, it's fucking...  Got to be in bed by Sunday.  Just, yes, exactly.  Or, actually, I just have to be up by Monday.  That's pretty much it.  Wow.  It's called a blackout.  But, yeah, so last night, as everybody knows, my God, Lost, premiere episode, season six, 
[00:10:00]  last season, this is it.  I mean, this is where all the loose ends have to be tied up.  Sure.  We're going to get our answers as to what has happened the previous five seasons, and  it starts off with just a shitload more questions.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Now, I thought I had this knocked. 
[00:10:30]  Uh-huh.  If you had listened to this very program, I had my theory as to what was going to happen.  I thought there was going to be a complete reset.  And?  There was.  I was like, wow, hey, look at me.  I'm right.  And then they throw you a curveball that is just, like, you just go, what?  What?  What?  Five minutes into it, you're like, what the fuck?  Yeah.  It's like, I thought I had it figured out.  No, I did not have it figured out. 
[00:11:00]  They threw such a curveball in that it just made more questions.  You were saying before the show, when we were talking about it a little bit, you said there  were two theories that the hardcore fans were all about.  Yeah, there were pretty much two theories.  And both theories kind of came true or whatever last night.  So I'm sitting there going, ha-ha, my theory was the right one.  Uh-huh.  And then, no.  Because the other one's right, too.  Wow.  So it's just, I don't know what's happening.  Me and Travis were laughing at the special effects, which, as I always say, when Butthead 
[00:11:30]  said, these special effects aren't very special.  I think they really blew a lot of these special effects money.  They didn't want to use a lot in the last season, it looked like.  Was it really bad, the underwater scene?  I didn't notice that was bad special effects.  I didn't notice the underwater scene being as bad as the, you know, smoke.  I immediately, when that underwater scene, the second they, like, the camera went through  that school of fish, I was like, this is the worst special effect I've ever seen.  Really? 
[00:12:00]  The shark is so fake looking.  I'm trying to find a video online.  But why would they do that?  I don't know.  Knowing that this loss is a huge show when they got a lot of money to spend on it, it's  the last season.  Why would they do this?  Why would they have the worst wigs in fucking show history?  Really?  Terrible wigs.  Well, they have to go through, you know, some time.  Is that one of the wigs, the blonde girl?  Yeah, but they got that wig shit figured out.  Not on Lost, they don't.  Whoever does costumes should be fired.  Huh.  And down a little bit.  So it's a hack show, is what you're telling me.  No, it's a great show. 
[00:12:30]  But the wig department must be fucking somebody related to your name.  You're going to fire the wig department?  Yeah, you're going to serve potato salad in it.  Yeah, there it is.  Okay, let's punch her up.  Is Claire?  Yeah.  Let me see, fucking fat.  How fat is she now with that awful wig?  Stupid Claire.  Jimmy was yelling that she had so much time to lose weight.  She was skinny in season one, and now she's just a fucking fatso like she was through season  five.  Who's Claire?  She's, well, she's, if you haven't seen it, she's the sister of one of the cast members. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, sister, and she's a mother, and, you know, the baby.  Oh, I forgot about the baby.  My baby.  Everybody did.  Oh, we had Claire in studio.  Yeah.  Who?  We had Claire in studio.  We had her in studio?  Yes.  Get the fuck out of here.  Yes.  Do we have a picture of that?  Maybe, I don't recognize her.  She was in the remake of The Hills Have Eyes looking so fucking hot.  She looked good, man.  She's smoking.  Again, she's got the eyes for The Hills Have Eyes.  Yeah.  Those are some nice eyes right there.  I think she had a kid in real life or something, because she did get fat. 
[00:13:30]  A lot of people say the CGI was awful.  Yeah, yeah.  The CGI wasn't as good as I've seen it on that show.  But, you know something?  I don't care.  I knew what was going on.  It's all story aligned for me and the characters.  But I didn't know what the fuck was going on.  I got, did I get any answers?  Maybe.  A couple of answers.  Maybe two answers. 
[00:14:00]  Twelve new questions.  There was a really big answer in there.  There was a big answer in there, yes.  I'll give you that.  But, I mean, introduction of a few new characters.  That you just have no fucking clue where they came from, why they're there, what they're doing.  Again, where people are isn't necessarily an easy thing to answer.  You know, you take some of the main characters. 
[00:14:30]  Are they...  Why are you looking at me?  Home?  I don't...  Are they on the island?  Are they...  Where are they?  I can't answer you that.  Why are you looking at me?  I'm just seeing how you...  I'm hearing Arabic right now.  I actually...  I'm looking at you because I want to see exactly what I look like when you guys talk basketball.  And that must be it.  I guess you have to talk to me.  Because there's a lot of people that haven't seen this law.  So, if you make it interesting for me...  See, now we're giving you the secret of radio.  Yeah.  Then people out there are listening closely. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ben was having tires put on the island.  Tires?  In case you don't want to drive it around again.  Jim's tire thing.  And then there was a character.  Mm-hmm.  A very prominent character on the show that was on the plane.  Didn't belong on the fucking plane.  Right.  And then...  Ain't on the fucking plane.  Probably because he's still zipping through time again. 
[00:15:30]  Is...  But...  And then there's another character that...  That...  Kind of knew...  That maybe he wasn't supposed to make it.  And then there's...  Like...  Wait, what do you mean?  There's shit going on...  On the plane.  Somebody knew...  Maybe they weren't supposed to be alive.  Oh, when he got nervous when they were shaking?  Uh...  No.  Uh...  In the bathroom.  Oh.  Dragging him out of the bathroom.  And it was like...  Uh...  He kind of turns around and...  Tells another major character... 
[00:16:00]  Uh...  You know...  Hey.  You know...  I was...  I was supposed to die.  You're like...  Holy shit.  Wait a minute.  What the fuck?  Oh.  It's so...  Yeah.  There's like...  There's so many new fucking questions.  I have no clue.  Wait.  They were up in the air again?  What?  This plane thing?  Well, yeah.  I think everybody...  If you're a fan of the show...  Knew that there was supposed to be...  After last season...  A reset.  Okay.  There's supposed to be a...  Here's the underwater CGI scene. 
[00:16:30]  It didn't even look like Ocean.  We're watching it.  Yeah.  This is...  Okay.  The little school of fish.  And now we're going through...  Um...  To the bottom...  Some kelp.  Now I'm seeing some things that...  Houses and stuff.  Maybe we shouldn't see...  Or talk about...  Because it might be a spoiler for a second...  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Sorry.  Where's the shark, though?  I want to see the shark.  Come on.  I've seen worse.  It's not that...  It's like...  I didn't even register to me that it was...  It looks like a video game.  Yeah.  It looks like Myst.  And then that little Myst.  Yes.  Myst. 
[00:17:00]  It looks like an underwater video game.  The whole show has a Myst kind of thing about it.  That game, Myst.  But, uh...  Yeah.  So...  There were just a lot of questions.  I was from the mindset that they were just going to reset.  You know?  And I'd said it.  My theory was...  They were all going to be on the plane...  Going to Los Angeles International Airport...  And get off the plane.  And then we were going to see what their lives were going to be like...  Had this never happened.  And then somehow, because the island has whatever... 
[00:17:30]  It's God and the stuff...  They would somehow be brought back together again.  The island has nothing.  And I'm like...  Yeah, yeah.  I got...  Wait, what?  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  What are you doing?  What is...  Stop that.  And, um...  It will leave you with more questions.  Very good, though.  I liked the episode.  I liked...  I didn't love it.  I liked it.  I didn't like the new characters.  I always hate new characters.  And the extras are the worst.  They're great actors.  But the extras are the worst fucking actors.  Extras are really bad on this.  Dude, the extras are lost.  They probably get them with the same people that make wigs. 
[00:18:00]  They're fucking terrible.  They're the wig makers.  But I didn't like the new characters.  There's the new characters in this temple.  I just didn't like them.  The one guy with glasses has, like, a bad lisp.  But he's been in a few things.  He sucks.  He was one of the guys in The Perfect Storm.  Your friend is dead.  Your friend is dead.  He was in Deadwood.  And he was the guy behind the counter in the brilliant scene in From Dusk Till Dawn,  where he was, like, yelling that he didn't tip off the sheriff's deputy.  He's terrible.  Yeah.  Look at the corny outfit he has on. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  I thought this almost seemed like some kind of Apocalypse Now kind of a thing,  where he was the, um, what's his name character?  Dennis Hopper.  Dennis Hopper-ish.  Without the chance.  Kind of character.  And, uh, and at one point, Locke was almost looking like a Colonel Kurtz with his head in the sunlight  and then slowly pulling back into darkness and stuff.  I saw some, an homage, if you will.  Not so much storyline, but there was some kind of Apocalypse Now homage to that whole temple scene. 
[00:19:00]  Well, yeah, but also the storyline, because he's there to kill Kurtz.  Yes, yes.  Exactly, yeah.  So, I'm seeing something like that going on.  Uh, but, you know, more questions.  More fucking questions.  More new characters.  And I didn't think it was just going to be one season of, hey, let's, uh, you know, wrap this up in the first episode.  How many episodes this year?  Uh, that was it. 
[00:19:30]  It's over.  I told Anthony, uh, before the show.  I hope he's a real fucking prick with this one before the show.  Because everyone's looking for the big ending that ties it all together.  And I go to Ant, I can't wait when you get your Don't Stop Believing ending.  Our Don't Stop Believing ending.  Where you yell and scream at the TV and go, that's it!  They're going to just play any way you want it.  That's the way you need it.  Yeah, they're going to just come up with another Journey song.  Another Journey song.  That just ends.  And they're all just sitting in a diner eating. 
[00:20:00]  Obviously, that's not going to happen.  They got to tie this thing together.  Unless they, uh, roll into a movie thing.  No, they would have to.  You don't think they roll into a movie?  No.  They got to tie this fucker up.  Why?  This is a, this is a, this would make, like, I don't know how much money.  But they would need some kind of conclusion on television.  Some kind of sort of conclusion.  And then in a few years bring back, like, a movie.  I don't know.  The creators have said that the TV show will wrap up these characters, but ABC and Disney 
[00:20:30]  owns Lost, so they wouldn't be surprised if ABC and Disney one day wanted to do something.  A cartoon, Saturday morning, Lost in a Harlem Globetrotters.  Oh, that would be cool.  Yeah.  Lost in space.  It'll have absolutely nothing to do with these people.  But, like, not lost in space.  Lost slash in space.  Curly Neal is fucking Kate on the island.  And then he fucks Bernard because Bernard's a cuckold.  Bernard is quite the cuckold.  I was just, I was just looking at their abomination, abomination of a marriage as they sit on the 
[00:21:00]  plane.  They didn't show, uh, turn it off if you didn't see.  Uh-oh.  I'm warning you now.  Just turn it off if we're talking about Lost in a minute.  They didn't show, uh, Michael.  They didn't show, obviously they didn't show Walt.  They showed Claire Fatt.  Who else didn't they show on the plane?  Hmm.  Hmm.  That might have been it.  Anybody from season two.  Mr. Echo.  Fucking, uh.  But Mr. Echo wasn't on the plane, was he?  Yes, he was.  Was he?  Okay, okay.  All right. 
[00:21:30]  I don't think you'll be seeing him on the plane.  No, wait a minute.  On the show.  Mr. Echo wasn't on the plane.  In the back of the plane.  And so was, uh, Michelle Rodriguez.  And so was fucking Libby.  Okay, well, we haven't looked over the whole fucking, uh, did we?  What?  Well, the plane landed.  Why weren't they there?  Or did it.  Then why weren't they on the fucking plane?  Well.  So I couldn't get some of the actors back.  Did he, you know, uh.  Echo kind of burned his bridge.  Did he?  Yeah.  Yeah, but I mean.  He asked to be off that show.  And that's the reason that they, that they killed him.  What a dummy.  Yeah.  What a fucking dummy.  Let me get off the biggest show ever. 
[00:22:00]  And what about the sister?  Hmm.  They had to change certain storyline things.  Ah, yeah.  Where was she?  The blonde girl, right?  She didn't want to leave the relationship.  Oh, Shannon?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She didn't want to leave the relationship.  Hmm.  Oh, she didn't know the contract she can't get out of.  Hmm.  Hmm.  I, I, I just, I have no clue.  So, so.  Hmm.  Out of five stars, I guess.  Trying to get your review.  Out of five stars for the first episode, not knowing how important all this shit is.  I don't know.  I would, I would still give it four. 
[00:22:30]  I, I mean, I thought it was really good, but, uh, I can't tell.  Maybe in a couple of weeks, I'll have given this episode a one, or maybe a fucking ten.  That's so weird that you can't even really review it.  You just don't even know.  Review it.  Like, just at face value, though, it was very cool after so much time goes by to actually,  you know, see the characters and shit.  How long was, was that fucking, uh, in production?  Uh, well, it ended in May, so.  Ended in fucking May.  Nine months?  Wow.  Yeah, like, nine, we could, could, could have had a fucking baby in the amount of time 
[00:23:00]  that, uh, they were off.  So it was kind of cool to see all the characters and everything like that, and, uh, uh, see  new shit.  Um, but, again, not really many answers.  You get some answers, but they don't, like, wrap anything up.  That's for sure.  There's just more people.  I don't understand why people are in one place, um, and then people are in another place.  I just, I don't fucking get it. 
[00:23:30]  But, hey, I'll be there every goddamn week.  I got that thing recorded just in case I miss it, and I'm ready to go.  I'm all in on this fucking show.  How, uh, how many million people, you think, watched it last night?  Uh, gotta be fucking, I don't know.  What does a show like that do?  I don't even know.  Many.  Many.  Uh, that, uh, yeah, what were the ratings?  Are there overnights on that thing?  No, not yet.  I would say pretty big.  Last year they averaged, like, you know, between 10 and 15 million. 
[00:24:00]  Jesus.  And, man, were they fucking commercial in our goddamn asses.  They always do.  I was checking, I'm going, all right, that's six fucking minutes a show, you cocksuckers.  Six minutes a show.  That's also why I think it's the highest, uh, DVR'd show.  DVR'd, yeah.  It's nice to DVR it and then just zip through.  Or if you have a nice HDMI connection on your TV, you just pop your fucking computer on there  and, uh, you watch that motherfucker, you watch that bitch from your computer on your 
[00:24:30]  big TV.  Yeah.  Yeah, and then you don't have to sit through commercials.  It's fucking great.  All right.  Yeah, very good.  Lost is here, finally.  Finally, lost.  I just don't have anything on it.  I gave it three stars, by the way.  Three?  Three.  Wow, Jimmy.  I gave it four.  I liked it.  I liked certain parts of it.  What was your, uh, what was your major malfunction with it besides the Planet of the Apes costumes?  Yeah, the new characters annoyed me.  And the fact that we actually had to see an interracial couple.  That didn't bother me as much. 
[00:25:00]  I just want to see...  That's why I didn't give it five stars.  I want to see Bernard eating her ass.  Bernard.  Bernard.  I didn't, uh, I just...  Fat Claire annoyed me.  Fat Claire.  They only showed her...  Exactly.  Fat Claire bugged me.  The, uh, the ending bugged me when one of them woke up.  You know, I kind of knew, like, who cares?  Yeah, but you know...  It's not him.  That's him.  I think that the battle continues kind of a thing.  Well, why don't we do this? 
[00:25:30]  Last year it did 11.4 million total viewers.  The, uh...  The two-hour premiere.  The premiere.  For season five.  The premiere.  So the first episode, a lot of people saw last night.  Yeah.  We got, uh...  Danny's...  You watched Lost, too, right, Danny?  No, but...  I did laugh.  Because, I mean, there's such a hullabaloo about Lost.  Oh, you watched...  Hullabaloo.  Language, Danny.  I assumed you were a Lost guy.  No, if he was, Danny would have been at the house last night.  You're not a Lost guy?  No, I don't know.  I just can't get...  Wow.  I can't get into it.  I didn't know it. 
[00:26:00]  I just assumed you were.  I thought it would be fun to just sit and watch, obviously, the two-hour premiere of the  final season, knowing that I was going to be completely lost.  How many have you seen?  This one? </pre>
