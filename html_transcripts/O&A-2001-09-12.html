<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast immediately following the September 11th attacks was a raw and emotionally charged response to the tragedy.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, abandoned their usual format, broadcasting from an off-Manhattan location due to city closures. They described the surreal emptiness of the streets, the eerie quiet, and their personal experiences witnessing the attacks unfold on television and from their commutes. Opie recounted the unsettling sight of a nearly full parking garage at a train station, realizing many commuters would not be returning to their cars. Anthony similarly described driving through the smoke and smelling the acrid air, yet feeling strangely detached from the immediate chaos.

The broadcast was dominated by calls from listeners, many in New York City, sharing harrowing firsthand accounts.  A Staten Island woman described the chaotic evacuation amid pitch-black dust clouds and the violent shaking of buildings.  Brian, who escaped from the 70th floor of the second World Trade Center tower, recounted the confusion, slow evacuation, the building’s violent shaking upon the second plane's impact, and his eventual escape, witnessing both towers collapse from a distance.  His friend, Steve Lynch, was in the studio, expressing his relief at Brian’s survival.  Other callers included a woman whose parents were on a rerouted flight from Rome, a New Jersey police officer overwhelmed by missing persons reports, a New York City firefighter frustrated by the perceived lack of emotion from politicians, and a woman whose brother narrowly escaped the USS Cole attack. A caller from Boston described the collective responsibility felt in his city.  Johnny Race detailed the efforts of his brother and a friend in rescue efforts.

The show featured several accounts of people close to Ground Zero.  "Psycho Mark," a controversial figure known to the show, provided eyewitness accounts from his apartment near the World Trade Center, which was even used as a filming location by Fox News. His brother also called, describing the family’s anxiety before contacting Mark. EMTs and military police officers shared their Ground Zero experiences. One caller unintentionally brought box cutters onto planes multiple times due to her job, highlighting pre-existing security concerns.  Another caller recounted a potential foiled attack on a JFK to LA flight. The hosts played short clips from Colin Powell and Newt Gingrich.  A segment helped a listener contact her parents on a rerouted flight.

Throughout the broadcast, anger and a desire for swift, decisive retaliation were recurring themes. One host suggested a low-yield nuclear weapon as a necessary response. Callers frequently expressed anger toward Osama bin Laden and countries harboring terrorists, advocating for aggressive military action, including bombing Afghanistan and other countries harboring terrorists, even at the cost of civilian casualties.  There was significant discussion of improving national security, including heightened airport security and armed personnel on flights, citing the 1993 World Trade Center bombing as a failure of past security measures.  One caller criticized the perceived political correctness that hindered effective responses to terrorism.  The discussion even touched on the fear felt by members of the Middle Eastern community.

A caller’s heartbreaking account detailed the death of their father in the Pentagon attack.  Jim Norton, a frequent guest, called in, expressing his emotional response and discussing upcoming comedy shows.  The show also explored seemingly unrelated tangents, such as Nostradamus predictions and numerological coincidences related to the flight numbers, and a caller’s anecdote about a Krispy Kreme donut supposedly saving their husband’s life.  One caller, Stacey, expressed opposition to retaliatory violence, advocating for an "intelligence" based approach; her opinion was met with strong disagreement from many callers and the hosts. A caller described the emotional impact of witnessing people jumping from the burning buildings.  A caller mentioned the possibility of internment being discussed as an internal security measure.  Another argued for prioritizing American citizens over foreign affairs, citing past leniency towards figures like Saddam Hussein. The show ended with a moment of silence for the victims.  The entire broadcast utilized strong and frequently offensive language to express the raw shock, grief, and intense anger felt in the immediate aftermath of the attacks.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, what's up, man? It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  How's it happening?  We are live in New York City.  Yeah, able to get into the city today.  Back to our home base.  A couple phone numbers we want to give out right away,  because we really need to do this with you guys today.  We need to hear from you guys.  If you're in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-277-4WOW.  That's 866-277-4WOW.  I hope all the radio stations that we syndicate to are picking up our show today. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, what happened yesterday?  I think a station or two bailed out of our broadcast.  Rochester could go F themselves.  What did they do?  And if I have any power in this company, we will move to another station that gets it.  They decided to go to local programming yesterday.  Which means?  Rock music that you've heard a million times.  Oh, a classic butt rock?  Yeah.  Well, why, um...  Ah, I'm sure they'll cut this out because we're on tape delay, but just a stupid move. 
[00:01:00]  Wouldn't it be kind of...  We had a show yesterday that was all about raw emotion  and people that were just sharing their feelings and their stories,  and we have one of the stations that we're on deciding that, you know, they'd rather play music.  Well, that's silly.  That's a station I don't need to be on.  Don't need it.  Anyway, um...  Yes, Ben?  Also, I just got an email.  Columbus didn't carry the show either yesterday.  Why is that?  Well, Columbus, they kind of had an excuse. 
[00:01:30]  They wanted to, uh...  They needed the satellite for some kind of, um...  AM news station or something.  That's excuse.  Oh, they were running news?  I got an excuse.  Yeah, but...  All right.  It just amazes me that Rochester would decide that music was more important than, uh...  than, uh...  the show we put on yesterday.  Yeah, we, uh...  You know, we're talking to people that were, uh...  involved in what went on here in New York.  So, I don't know.  That's odd.  All right.  Where do we begin today?  Well, first...  Day two.  Day two.  Day two.  The day after.  Whatever you want to call it.  Um...  I'm a little more pissed off. 
[00:02:00]  Right.  I gotta...  I gotta start by sharing a story, Ann, and then we could, uh...  Go with that, okay?  All right.  Because, uh...  I mean, I think to, uh...  Most people yesterday, it just didn't, um...  It just didn't seem real.  I mean, it was so surreal.  It was like...  It was like, am I watching all this live on TV?  It just...  I mean, you're seeing it, sure.  But it was hard.  You just couldn't believe you were seeing it.  You know what I mean?  It wasn't really sinking in.  You felt like you were in a dream, a nightmare.  Uh...  Watching a movie, some people have said.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  It's like, am I really seeing people, you know, um... 
[00:02:30]  Falling out of these buildings, jumping to their death.  People screaming.  Am I...  Am I hearing the S-word and the F-word on...  On national TV?  Because they have, you know, home video of, uh...  Of, uh, new angles of the planes hitting the World Trade Center.  It just...  I couldn't believe I was seeing it, right?  So, uh, we did our show from, uh, uh, the studios out there in Garden City at WLIR.  I want to thank those guys for helping us out yesterday.  We couldn't get in the city.  They closed the city, you know?  Yeah.  And, um, so after the show, you know, we walked out to our cars and it was just, uh... 
[00:03:00]  Wasn't it creepy?  There was just no one around.  The roads were dead.  Very eerie.  Very eerie.  The sun...  One of the nicest sunsets I've ever seen.  Yeah.  Through that cloud and stuff.  It was just...  It was just weird.  Anyway.  It was a beautiful day.  So, uh, the story I want to share, um...  So, I'm driving back home to, um, Huntington, where I live.  On Long Island, okay?  Mm-hmm.  And, uh...  You know, because of this job and stuff,  there are hundreds of times I'm driving home late from the city or a gig 
[00:03:30]  or just hanging out on Long Island.  And I take the same route home.  And I drive by, uh, my local, um, train station.  Yeah.  Uh, Cold Spring Harbor, you know.  I go by and there's a light there.  And I swear, just because of how the parking lot is set up and stuff,  kind of, uh, on a hill and everything,  you always look over and you're like...  You always look at the parking lot for some reason.  And, uh, usually you see a scattering,  maybe 10 or 12 people that decided to go in the city, 
[00:04:00]  stay over for whatever reason, okay?  Yeah.  Last night, I'm with my, with my brother, Brett, and we're driving.  And also, we're at the light.  And he, he nudges me and goes,  look at the parking lot.  Mm-hmm.  Dude, when I tell you there were hundreds of cars in that parking lot.  Yeah.  And I'm thinking, and that's when the reality of this whole thing hit me.  I'm like, holy S.  Not, not every single one of these cars,  but there are a lot of people that parked in the morning  that are not coming back to their cars.  Yeah.  And that's when I, I, I completely lost it. 
[00:04:30]  And it all just started making sense.  And it sunk in.  Like, holy crap.  Yeah.  This really did happen.  Yes, it did.  As we watched a million times.  Boy, the news.  All right.  You know, I think we've all seen it.  You know, I don't, I don't think they have to just keep playing the clips  over and over again, okay?  They will.  I mean.  Oh, they're playing forever.  Enough. 
[00:05:00]  Please.  And then the people falling out of the building is just beyond even being able to deal with.  Yeah.  I can't watch that on TV.  I can't thumb through the newspaper and see it in a paper.  Well, you know, I, I personally pride myself on being a tough guy.  You know what I mean?  I was on the Long Island Railroad this morning and I, and every paper decided to run,  you know, one shot of the people falling.  I'm freaking lost it on the train.  Just lost it.  It's like, got a guy, you know, there's one, I don't know what paper, guy in a business suit, 
[00:05:30]  no shoes on, just plummeting to his death.  There you go.  Right in, right in our paper.  You know?  You know, if you're hearing this in, um, in other cities, uh, do yourself a favor and  try to find the New York, uh, newspapers because there are some eyewitness accounts  in there that'll just blow your mind.  Because, I mean, all of the, uh, mainstream, uh, media of New York was down on the scene  by the time the second, uh, plane hit.  Yeah.  And, and some of the accounts are just unbelievable.  People walking around the building, you know, picking up business cards from this, this guy 
[00:06:00]  who worked in this company on the 90th floor of, uh, the World Trade Center.  Uh, people found checks.  Yeah, there's just, uh, personal stuff from people.  Pictures.  Thrown all over the place.  You know, uh, children's pictures that were on people's desks.  Just amazing stuff in the paper today.  Yeah, I was, uh, totally bummed last night.  I've been driving home from, uh, Long Island, uh, trying to get into Brooklyn.  You know, that's west.  Trying to get, uh, toward the city, which major highways were just closed. 
[00:06:30]  So I had to take what amounts to secondary roads and side streets, uh, about 20 miles or  so, um, to get home last night.  And, uh, and I finally get home.  It's nine o'clock or something.  I'm seeing the smoke and smelling the smoke from, uh, uh, the World Trade Center.  I don't know where it was.  And, uh, it was so strange.  I'm walking into my apartment.  Beautiful night last night.  You know, it was nice and cold.  One of those great nights.  And, uh, it was dark.  And I saw the lights, uh, across the river, uh, in Jersey and Staten Island. 
[00:07:00]  And, uh, you know what?  I'm thinking, I can't hear a thing.  A little breeze.  I'm thinking, Jesus Christ.  Just, uh, like a mile or so away from me right now.  Tops.  A couple of miles.  Uh, havoc was going on.  But it's, it's just, it was fine there where I was.  Yeah.  Just a couple of miles away.  Yeah.  And then the reality, like you said, hits you and you're just, gee, this is, this is  so aft.  And it was just.  It was like a curse because I'm so pissed off. 
[00:07:30]  And it was just, uh, such a weird feeling.  Um, I fell asleep with the TV on.  I'm like, there's no way I'm turning this crap off.  So, you know, I got my pillow and I'm on my couch and I passed out when I did.  I have no clue.  Woke up.  It was still on.  And I just had this feeling I needed, you know, I just needed to be in New York today.  Just needed to, you know, cause we felt so, uh, detached yesterday from everything.  Yeah, it was kind of weird being out on Long Island trying to, uh, talk about what's going  on in the city when we're usually right here in the middle of Manhattan.  Right.  So, uh, I go to the Huntington, uh, train station today. 
[00:08:00]  And I, I, it was, it was just the weirdest thing.  I've taken the same train, uh, so many times and I ain't funny.  Uh, a ton of people going, you know, taking the train into the city, uh, on the 922 at  Huntington, on the platform.  No one was smiling.  No one, no one, I understand.  No one was talking.  They were moving around like zombies.  No one would acknowledge anyone else.  There were, uh, there were doctors all over the platform trying to get into the city.  There were guys in army fatigues all over the place with dogs. 
[00:08:30]  Going into the city with the dogs.  Don't have to tell you what that's all about.  Um, and, and, and on the train, not a word.  I mean, there was a packed train, not one word the whole, the whole ride in.  Yeah.  Everyone's pissed.  And then, uh, you know, I, I walked the 23 blocks up to, you know, where we broadcast  and it was, it's just weird out there.  Yeah.  They beat us up real good.  It's just weird.  I, we were, uh, I was, um, out front of the Empire State Building and I just didn't, I,  I have to admit it.  I, I, I just felt like I, wow, you know, get away from this building. 
[00:09:00]  I swear.  Cause I mean, they had cornered off their cops all over just kind of, cause they were on  tourist alert right now.  Yeah.  There's, uh, the, I think it's the John F. Kennedy, the aircraft carrier.  Yeah.  That's, uh, right here in the harbor.  Mm-hmm.  And fighter planes.  It's all you hear.  But it is a little, a little alarming when you hear the, uh, any jet engine over your  head, uh, here in New York City.  Cause you just think about it.  I mean, you look up at a tall building that you're next to cause Christ, it's New York. 
[00:09:30]  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, yeah, it kind of, uh, brings you right to that, uh, right to the moment and the place,  uh, uh, that was the World Trade sending us.  We went out for coffee.  There's just a truck, uh, an army truck going by filled with army guys.  Yeah.  Just tooling down 57th.  Who, who thought?  Who would have thunk it?  And when we went outside, it's just weird.  Um, people, people, there's a guy downstairs at the Brooklyn Diner.  He didn't care less about us in general.  He gives us coffee and, you know, we see him for breakfast every once in a while. 
[00:10:00]  You know, he's one of the, you know, the managers there or something.  Yeah.  We walked out, out of the building.  We were just kind of hanging out there and he comes running out to shake our hand.  He goes, you know, it's just so good to see you guys.  Yeah.  Everybody's pretty happy to see everyone.  Yeah, and they're just, you know, in your little neighborhood in the city, they're just,  you know, running around and, uh, you know, saying, hey.  Yeah.  All right.  You're, you're okay.  Yeah, that seems to be what everyone's doing today.  And, uh, it just sunk in.  Like, uh, last night after I got home, of course, I was watching the coverage like everyone 
[00:10:30]  else.  And you're watching the same stuff.  There really wasn't anything new happening.  So it's just being bashed in your head the whole night.  I think everybody was doing this.  You didn't want to, uh, peel yourself away from the television, even though it was the same  stuff over and over again.  And, uh, finally, uh, we just said, screw it.  You know, let's go to bed.  And, uh, that's when, you know, you just lay in there and, and you try to shut your eyes  and go to sleep.  And all I'm seeing is planes crashing into buildings and the fireballs and the different  angles and the people falling.  And, uh, it made it really hard to fall asleep. 
[00:11:00]  I think I got to sleep at three and woke up at 7.30 this morning.  Yeah.  You know, I had, uh, no sleep.  And I just woke up again more pissed than I was yesterday about this whole thing.  Were you happy with the president's speech last night?  No.  Can we, can we wake up Reagan, please?  Get rid of the Alzheimer's?  Get, let's get someone with emotion.  Now, I know that knows how to talk to the American people.  I know they, I know they have things they have to do and stuff, but there's a way of,  uh, showing you mean business and, and, and a way of showing, uh, a little anger and 
[00:11:30]  a little emotion.  He was a freaking robot reading, uh, cue cards.  I felt like I was watching Carson Daly.  And this was like TRL or something.  Like, hello, say something.  It's true.  Uh, he said nothing.  He said nothing last night.  And watch him.  And it's your typical politician making a speech.  Now, I know the whole line.  We, we stand behind the president, uh, uh, that whole deal.  But you know something?  I want to see either from him or somebody some anger. 
[00:12:00]  Be pissed off.  It's okay.  I don't want an eloquent speech written by a speech writer about how we will overcome  this and how America is brave and strong.  We know that.  Okay?  We're the Americans you're talking about.  What I want to hear is how pissed off we are and how we are absolutely gonna, gonna screw  some people up over this thing.  The anger isn't there.  The genuine emotion that they feel as human beings is lost in, in their reading of these 
[00:12:30]  speeches.  That's what annoys the hell out of me.  I want anger.  I'm pissed.  So when I look at a leader on the TV talking about this whole thing, I want him to be pissed  to assure me.  You don't have to assure me that America will go on and we will heal.  I know this.  I want to be assured that we're gonna kick some ass.  That's what I want to be assured about.  And that's something I haven't seen yet.  And that pisses me off.  Hallelujah.  We gotta make a statement here.  And, you know, I might, people might say I sound nutty saying this or, oh, that's what 
[00:13:00]  everyone's saying or something.  I believe, I truly believe, and I never thought I'd say this, that we have to use something  in the line of a low-yield nuclear weapon.  Either on Afghanistan, who is known to harbor bin Laden.  And we have to set an example.  We can firebomb the whole city over there, Kabul, with conventional weapons. 
[00:13:30]  And you know what?  It won't mean anything.  We've done this before.  But if you detonate a nuclear weapon over a country, do you think another country is  going to want to help out these terrorists knowing that, hey, the U.S., they'll nuke you?  And I think we've been away with it with the rest of the world seeing what we just went  through.  It's not like we'd all of a sudden be under an umbrella of nuclear weapons raining down 
[00:14:00]  on us.  It can't.  I think this is the perfect time to use a horrible weapon to make these people think  twice about doing something.  I've already heard people on the radio saying, you know, don't stoop to their level.  No, no.  Please.  We will find them and bring them to justice.  Justice.  Justice.  Diplomacy should be used to calm down the people that will be pissed after we use some  kind of low-yield tactical nuclear weapon in a desert area of Afghanistan.  It doesn't even have to kill anybody. 
[00:14:30]  Do you understand that?  I'm not talking about even nuking the city.  If you drop it in the desert, just the statement it would make that we dropped a nuclear weapon  on your country because you were involved with terrorists would make the ultimate statement  that if you're a country that's going to back these people, this is the price you're going  to pay.  And I do believe a lot of countries would be pissed.  Yeah, they'd have to come out and say, oh, my God, this is horrible that the United States  would use a weapon like this.  But that's when our diplomats go out and say, hey, you know something, look at this 
[00:15:00]  videotape.  Thousands of people right here, dead.  So you want to say this isn't justified?  Right.  Go screw.  And that's where diplomacy can come in.  But before that, we have to make a statement that is bigger and huger than anything we've  ever done before.  Bravo.  Let's go to the phones.  We need to do this with you guys today.  So please give us a call with your stories, what you're feeling, all that crap.  You know the deal.  Frank, what's going on?  Fellas, what's happening?  Hey.  I got a couple of stories, but before I do that, I just want to thank you guys for being 
[00:15:30]  on the air yesterday to add a little bit of reassurance and normalcy that things are  going to get back to normal.  Just hearing the news all day was eerie, but hearing you guys made it seem a little bit  like it wasn't going to be that bad all the time.  You know what I mean?  Well.  You know, Opie, I understand what you're saying.  I know you don't think you did anything, but I think a lot of listeners will agree that  being able to hear perspective from guys like you that we kind of feel is  as you're our friends made us feel a little better. 
[00:16:00]  I know I'm sitting in my office not knowing how I'm getting home.  I felt better.  We were put in a position yesterday that I have no desire to be in.  Right.  None whatsoever.  I'm all about let's have some fun.  Let's get some chuckles out there and make you forget about your day at work.  And we were thrown into a situation and then, you know, we did the best we could.  And I appreciate that, Frank.  You guys did a fantastic job.  You know?  A couple things I wanted to relate.  I work in Midtown.  And last night when the train started running, I finally knew I could get to my apartment uptown. 
[00:16:30]  And just walking in the streets in Midtown, normally rush hour, with nobody was eerie.  Yeah.  The weirdest thing.  Oh, there's barely anyone outside our building right now.  Yeah.  And no one is smiling.  No one is talking.  It is just a weird, weird scene.  And what Ant said, I was sitting there last night in my apartment hearing F-15s flying over.  How weird is that when you just hear the scream of, and you could tell the difference between a fighter engine 
[00:17:00]  than a passenger jet engine.  But it kind of shakes you up a little bit.  Sure.  Yeah, I hope we're expressing this to the other cities that obviously are in New York  or Washington, how insane it is around here.  It's just strange.  First of all, it's like a ghost town in many sections of the city.  Like Ant says, we've got jets flying overhead.  We've got Army men.  We've seen guns now.  Two days ago, who would ever have thought you'd have that in one of the biggest cities in the world, 
[00:17:30]  New York City?  Army vehicles going around.  National Guard in the streets.  People trying to pull bodies out of wreckage.  And a huge national landmark.  The World Trade Center.  Both towers gone.  You know, it's inconceivable.  It's something that only happened in the movies.  And dealing with it is just that I get more pissed every time I watch those clips.  And, you know, you really start thinking deep into everything. 
[00:18:00]  Who hasn't thought about what it was like in that plane, in those planes?  And the smiling face of that son of a bitch at the controls when he drilled it into those buildings.  I mean, it gets me so pissed off.  And there's only one way to deal with it.  To make it so these people have nowhere to go.  No country would dare take them in because they know that the wrath of the United States would be unlike anything they've seen in the past.  Except maybe for Hiroshima or Nagasaki. 
[00:18:30]  You know?  It's the only way we can deal with this situation.  And no one's saying it.  No one's pissed off on the news.  No one's pissed.  They're all careful.  Being real careful.  If I have to look at Paula Zahn's face looking like she's smiling through this whole thing.  I don't know.  Maybe that's just a look.  But it's pissing me off that she's looking like that.  They're all wondering how this is going to affect their political careers.  Right.  Are they going to win an award when it comes around to best news coverage of a huge story?  No one's pissed off. 
[00:19:00]  I'm effing pissed.  And I don't want to sit and listen to George Bush say that they can't hide forever.  And these countries won't be able to back them forever.  What we need now is patience.  No.  Screw patience.  Because you know what happens with patience and waiting and weeks go by?  People forget and lose this pissed off feeling that they have.  And it goes on business as usual. 
[00:19:30]  And just like when those embassies got bombed and military barracks get bombed, we forget and we don't care.  We have short-term memory loss here.  We kind of, it fades away.  And we can't let that happen.  We've got to stay pissed.  Alan, what's up?  Yeah, hi.  Just a couple of quick comments.  Remember back in the Cuban Missile Crisis, Kennedy dealt with it and he's afraid that if he didn't deal with it, he could be impeached?  I wonder if the same thing would happen to President Bush. 
[00:20:00]  If he doesn't deal with this and try and protect the American public, could he be impeached from office also?  Well, he's obviously going to do something.  It's just, you know, the waiting is killing us all.  Yeah, yeah.  And my second point is...  He can't just sit on his butt, bro.  Well, I wasn't impressed by his speech.  And this morning...  The speech was ridiculous.  I think we could all agree.  I mean, he was reading, you know, a prepared statement, basically, on cue cards.  We need...  We need a...  Love him or hate him, man.  Reagan was a leader.  He was a leader.  When he talked to the American people, whether you agreed or disagreed, you're like, 
[00:20:30]  holy ass, that guy means business.  Right.  People feared him.  Right.  Yeah.  And I agree.  And this morning, he says, well, he's going to get money from Congress.  Who needs money now?  We need action.  Right.  Right.  We need action.  And the other thing is, when the FBI is supposedly arresting all these guys and finding them in  Miami and Boston and wherever else...  Well, the Western Hotel in Boston.  Yeah.  That's just like, you know, finding a few cells of cancer.  You've got to get to the root of the cancer before you're going to eradicate the whole thing. 
[00:21:00]  Absolutely.  That's what I'm saying.  And it's a lot of people saying they don't agree with what I'm saying about using some  kind of nuclear weapon.  They're saying it would start a nuclear war.  With who?  Who would then launch?  What nuclear powers in the world would then launch a nuclear strike against us, having seen  the damage these bastards did to a couple of our cities?  Who, China?  Is China going to launch against us?  Is Russia going to launch?  No. 
[00:21:30]  Will they be outraged?  Sure.  Yeah.  And I think we have a damn good explanation.  Just look at the videotape of people jumping out windows and airplanes full of people flying  into the sides of buildings.  Jumping out of windows thinking that's the only chance they got.  Do you honestly think a country is going to launch a nuclear war against us for using  a nuclear weapon against these animals?  No.  Now, this right here is the perfect time to use it because there isn't a country that 
[00:22:00]  would respond in kind.  They would look and go, holy crap, we better not handle these terrorists.  We better not sponsor them.  We better not put them up.  We better not give them a breakfast.  The United States just nuked Afghanistan.  Plus, wait till you hear how many people have died.  I mean, the mayor, you know, he's doing a great job trying to keep the city positive and  together.  You know, instead of starting to talk about numbers of how many people have died down  there, he's, you know, he's spinning it the other way.  Hey, good news. 
[00:22:30]  We found five guys, you know, alive, 430 this morning.  We found this guy over here.  They're starting to say 10 to 15,000.  They're saying thousands dead here in this.  More than has been killed in terrorist acts between Palestine and Israel in years.  JDS is huge.  Hey, what's up?  I was talking, hold on.  I was talking to one of the sales guys.  I don't think he wants to come on the air.  And a lot of the people that worked at the World Trade Center, they lived in Hoboken. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  They said that half that neighborhood could be gone because so many people lived there  because it was an easy commute.  Right.  And they're saying that, you know, there are just, that area is completely devastated.  People are, they don't know where their neighbors are.  Whole, uh, firms that worked in, in those office buildings.  There were firms that employed, you know, 3,500 people a clip that just don't know where  any of the people that worked in those firms are.  They just disappeared. 
[00:23:30]  And we're supposed to sit back and be patient and wait and, uh, and, and not be angry and  not, and, uh, show some spirit.  They can't hide forever.  What are we going to play hide and seek with them?  Yeah.  They're with you guys?  Hey, J.D., what's up?  What's up, man?  Thank you so much, guys.  Listen, uh, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm with you, you 100% there, you know, time to warm  up the nukes for crying out loud instead of living, they're collecting dust, you know?  It would make such a statement.  It would, but there's another statement we can put right behind that, though, bro.  Yeah. 
[00:24:00]  I'm sure there's plenty of politicians out there that are just as whacked as you guys  and all of us listeners are over there.  We've got to get these guys to get Congress to, to, to stand behind the city and, and the  state and pack, pack in the funds and dig out the old blueprints of the World Trade  Center and put it back exactly the way it was before.  We are, we are way too early.  Yeah, you know something, it is early.  That would be more of a statement than leaving an empty parking lot as a memorial.  Yeah, I don't want an empty parking lot there.  I don't want a, a cushy feel-good monument or park.  What we need there is a huge building, uh, uh, just like the, uh, World Trade Center. 
[00:24:30]  Just like those two towers.  That's the statement in itself saying you're not going to stop us.  We are what we are.  We will always be what we build.  Build it bigger.  Build it taller.  Beat out the, the one that's in Malaysia.  Sure.  The one that is the world's tallest building now.  Go ahead.  You, you, you, you took that one down.  We'll build one bigger and better.  Exactly, and I want to reiterate what the guy said earlier.  You guys were, were such, it was, it was so good to hear you guys.  I know you guys were forced into this position, but it was still a huge relief to hear some 
[00:25:00]  familiar voices on the radio.  Well, we, and people we can relate to, you know.  I personally didn't think it was my place, you know.  I didn't want to come on the air yesterday.  I really didn't.  But you know, you guys, you really did a great job.  You know what it is, though?  Screw that.  I, I, I, as for selfish reasons, when we got done yesterday, I felt bad because then it  was like, uh, now I got nothing to do but think about this, you know.  It kind of was, uh, if I could use a politically, uh, or the cushy, cushy, psychobabble word, 
[00:25:30]  therapeutic.  Uh, it was kind of that way for me.  Yeah, well, it gave us something to do and occupy our time and minds.  And then when seven o'clock rolled around, it was like, oh, crap, now I got to deal with  the, the reality of this whole thing.  Well, I think most, most of your listeners are all, all in the same mindset as, as you  guys are.  And, uh, you know, you know, we're just rolling this together and, uh, we all feel the same  way.  It's just nice to be able to have some people that, that think the same way as your listeners  do and just, uh, to get it out, you know, vent a little bit.  Yeah.  What else can we do?  We're standing there with our hands in our pockets that don't know what the next step is. 
[00:26:00]  We've just been beat up and, uh, we would like to, uh, kick some ass immediately.  And I understand, you know, uh, Paul from Boston's checking in on instant feedback and  he says, I should stop this crap and stand behind the president.  Uh, we're not saying we're not standing behind the president.  I am standing behind it.  And I know that, that we will do something.  There will be a response and I'm sure it will be huge.  I just want to see genuine emotion from these people.  Uh, it seems to me like a lot of the politicians, not just George W. Bush, but a lot of them that  are taking to the TV and reading these speeches are trying to make these historic, uh, will 
[00:26:30]  last forever, a day that will live in infamy, uh, ich benign Berliner kind of history speeches.  I don't care about that.  I want real emotion.  I want reality from these people.  I want to know they're pissed and that they're, they're going to do something about it.  That's what's missing with our leaders today.  You know, you just genuine emotion.  Oh my God.  Right.  Uh, Pat, what's up?  Yeah, how are you guys doing?  All right.  I've been listening to you guys maybe since like team, team week last year. 
[00:27:00]  Surprised yesterday.  You guys thought your composure was so good and that was pretty good of you guys.  But, uh, I'm a freshman in college and I listened to you guys all day yesterday and I  was just stuck at, you guys were angry and everything.  I was just sick just sitting there, but this morning I turned on CNN, man, like get those  hydrogen bombs up and throw them over there.  Yeah.  All right, Pat.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I see everyone's just pissed.  Let's go to Jamie.  Jamie.  Yeah.  What's up, guys?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, uh, I just wanted to, uh, uh, sorry.  A little nervous.  A little sickened about everything. 
[00:27:30]  I bet.  Uh, volunteer fireman over here in Long Island.  Actually, I live in Huntington, too, and I drove by that Cold Spring Harbor train station.  Yeah.  And coming home from my firehouse last night, going by there, about 11 o'clock at night, there's  still 50 cars to 100 cars, maybe in the parking lot.  Yeah.  And it's never like that.  And you know that.  Exactly.  I go by there every day at, you know, 3.30, 4 o'clock.  And that's just our little community.  Right.  Exactly.  I mean, this is happening in all the communities around, uh, which I say.  Well, you can only hope it was people that were forced to walk out and, you know.  Assuming that some of them are, sure, okay, but you got the train service home. 
[00:28:00]  Right.  You can bet your bottom dollar, though, there's a few right there in Cold Spring Harbor that  didn't make it.  Oh, yeah.  It was weird, too, because we got called in to go sit at the Belmont Racetrack to get  called in as, like, relief crews for the city.  Yeah.  And fortunately and unfortunately, we didn't get to, I know our crew didn't make it to  go in, but there are crews from departments that we know that did make it in there.  And there are also city firemen that were friends of ours that are volunteers also on  the island, too, that we've already known that didn't make it. 
[00:28:30]  You know, when you hear, uh, the reports that up to three or four hundred firefighters and  police officers, uh, are, are dead, which in my opinion, I think is a conservative number  right now.  Oh, yeah.  We've been hearing reports of, I mean, I won't give numbers because it's just what we were  hearing, but I mean, it is a heck of a lot more than three or four hundred tags that are  still not accounted for.  You can't even imagine something like that.  I mean, the, the, uh, outpouring of emotion for, for the three firefighters that were killed  recently was unbelievable. 
[00:29:00]  The, the funerals, uh, for them, could you imagine that times a hundred?  Right.  We were at one of those funerals for one of those guys, the, uh, the one from Hampstead.  How do you, how do you even deal with something like that?  Three hundred or four hundred or more funerals for these people.  I mean, it's, it's something you can't even imagine or, or know how they would deal with  or, or even carry out.  The chief of the department was standing next to a command post, the chief and I think two  or three of his assistants. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  And we've been listening.  We also have a scanner in my garage at work and I got it in my car and we're listening to  Manhattan central, uh, communications.  And they're going over the air with the announcements of the deputy chiefs and the chiefs saying  that they were killed on nine 11, you know, the box number and everything else.  And you're sitting in your car listening to it and you're like, you know, it's hitting  you.  You see all these cars.  So the train station, you're listening to it on the radio, on the scanner and stuff.  And we're standing there in Belmont racetrack, just watching the smoke come over the horizon  and, you know, listening to the scanners in Belmont racetrack. 
[00:30:00]  It's just, you can't imagine, you know, everybody's sitting to watch on TV and we were, you know,  say a step closer listening to it on the scanners, hearing, you're listening on the scanner yesterday.  They had a captain talking underneath the rubble with five of his guys or four or five of his  guys.  It's just despicable.  He's trapped and they couldn't get to him.  It's, it's just despicable.  And these guys, I mean, uh, against everything your instincts tell you, they, uh, run into a  building that any normal, uh, a human would just flee from. 
[00:30:30]  And these guys, uh, you know, one mission to get in there and, and help people and get  them out.  And, uh, their lives were taken doing that by, by these, these animals.  Yep.  You can only imagine.  We've had some, uh, little, little, yeah, seriously, little fires in this building.  You know, maybe the kitchen at one of the restaurants downstairs smoking the elevator shaft.  Maybe when we were cooking rat.  No, no, no, no.  But I mean, just for a, a, a small situation like that, it's amazing how many, uh, you know,  firemen are in a building. 
[00:31:00]  They were doing triage in the stairways.  And I mean, you know, people that were burnt.  No one knew that that first building especially was coming down and their job, uh, uh, the  heroes that they are, are, are to go in there and help these people get out and try to fight  that fire that was, uh, way, way up in the eighties.  And, uh, it's just, I cannot imagine how we have to deal with, with hundreds of, of 
[00:31:30]  these guys, these, uh, firefighters and, and cops, hundreds of them, uh, dying.  I don't know how we're going to deal with that.  I don't, I don't know if you heard stories.  I'll make this the last thing.  I'll let you guys go on.  There was, uh, a guy who was on the 80th floor of Tower 2.  And when the fire broke out, you know, when the first plane hit, they started evacuating.  They got down to the 50th floor and the PA system was saying, uh, there's a fire in  Tower 1.  It's, uh, the firemen are there trying to get under control.  You can resume your normal duties.  Yeah, we've heard that on the news.  So people were starting to go back up and there's one guy who was saying, screw this. 
[00:32:00]  I'm going out.  Yep.  And then the plane crashed right into the same floor that he was on.  Yep.  Made the right decision.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, Jamie.  Thank you.  Thanks guys.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's go to Keith the cop.  A very good friend of the show.  Keith.  What's going on, fellas?  How are you?  Hey, bro.  Let me tell you, the pictures and the news, it just, it pales in comparison to seeing it  in person.  Yeah, well, that's something I really don't need, uh, in my nightmares for the rest of my  life.  I don't know how you guys are even doing it.  You know, I mean, to go down there last night and the darkness and just, it's unbelievable, 
[00:32:30]  man.  I mean, the cars just piled on top of each other that blew up and the shells of cars and to see  the buildings just, dude, it's unbelievable.  I mean, you know, and now we're here and we're starting to deal with, you know, the  loss, you know, and to thinking of the people that, you know, you worked with and to try  and go on and do what we do, you know.  Yeah.  I don't know how, I don't know how the hell you do it and how you go on after something 
[00:33:00]  like this and, uh, do things like, you know, go out bike riding on a weekend or so, or just  go on with your life after you've seen something like this.  I don't know how you guys do it.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, I went home finally last, you know, this morning at like six o'clock  and we just got back into work today and you, you come in and you, you see the resources  that are here.  I mean, the departments from, you know, you got to thank them from all over the tri-state 
[00:33:30]  area and the amount of equipment, the construction equipment, it's just.  Yeah.  We, we've seen it coming into the city and, uh, the, the news, you watch the news, the faces  on, on the cops and the firefighters taking the, maybe five minutes to sit down and just  catch their breath.  The looks on their faces, uh, you could look at old, uh, uh, film clips of Vietnam and  you see that same look on the people's faces that are sitting there that have been in, in  battle.  And, uh, you know, it's, it's not much different than, than what you guys are going through. 
[00:34:00]  No, it's really not, you know.  And unfortunately, I think a lot of, a lot of the, uh, police and, and fire fighters and,  uh, emergency service workers are going to go through a lot of the stuff that, that, uh,  veterans of, of war have to go through, which is horrible.  You know, it doesn't, sometimes it doesn't hit you.  Like, I just came back now and I mean, the car ride in, we were, we were together with  friends and we're joking and everything and you get in, you start seeing it again, just  coming over the bridge and seeing the, the cloud.  Yeah, the cloud is so eerie. 
[00:34:30]  It's a ghost of the World Trade Center that won't go away.  It's, it's exactly, it's a plume of smoke, exactly where, uh, the towers were and it,  it, it, it gives you an image of, of where it was.  It's a ghost of the buildings and it won't go away.  It's, I, you know, you see it on TV.  It's, it's another to, to see it live.  It's just, uh, I don't know how we could express it to you guys.  It's the, it's so eerie because there's not a cloud in the sky in Manhattan today, except 
[00:35:00]  for that cloud.  Yeah.  Another, you know, what would have been a beautiful day.  You're walking around downtown and you see the civilians and the cops.  I mean, we're walking around with the filter masks on.  Yeah.  People trying to go about their daily routine and, you know, we have to live like this now.  The other thing, taking the Long Island Railroad in today, you get a beautiful shot of the  entire New York City skyline, uh, skyline, uh, just before you go into the tunnel there.  Right.  And, uh, just as we got to that point, it, it, most people that, uh, regular day take the  skyline for granted and it's like, oh, whatever. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, they'll, you know, look up in their newspaper, maybe real fast or whatever.  Today, it was amazing how many people shifted to the left side of the train to try to see  where the Twin Towers used to be.  Yeah.  It was, it was, it was powerful.  Yeah.  It's awful, man.  All right, fellas, I'm going to work.  All right, Keith.  Get some sleep at some point.  Jesus.  All right.  Thanks, man.  I'll talk to you guys soon.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Bye.  Let's see what I did right when I got home.  Uh, polished off the bottle of, uh, Captain Morgan that I had. 
[00:36:00]  Uh, I got home at about nine o'clock.  It was on top of the fridge.  Didn't even stop to take my usual, uh, I just got home leak.  No, just mixed it right up.  I needed it.  If I ever needed a stiff drink, it was, uh, it was last night.  That's what a lot of people did in Manhattan last night.  I mean, a lot of bars full of people with the TVs on, you know, people just getting completely  hammered, not in a, in a celebratory way, just getting hammered, just trying to numb the  pain and all just kind of crowded around, uh, the TVs, checking it out.  Ben, Ben's whole neighborhood, they were just, the bars were just completely packed. 
[00:36:30]  I walked, uh, 60 blocks home last night to get the feel.  So the good 60 blocks, you could start smelling the smoke in the thirties and then, you know,  the firefighters and the teens and just, just all the crap all over them, you know, from  the wreckage and then, then going to St. Vincent's, which was just totally indescribable because  they had the, you know, the, the stretchers and the wheelchairs and everything lined up.  But, you know, there was, people were out everywhere. 
[00:37:00]  Our restaurants were just packed with the TVs on, blaring loud, and just everyone glued  everywhere.  You know, we love to, we would love to think we're prepared for, uh, stuff like this as  a country, uh, where we would have all the appropriate equipment and everything else.  And you think by some miracle, uh, I mean, you know, God damn it, we're the United States  of America, most powerful country in the world, uh, richest nation, that we would have everything  available to us and, you know, we could take anything, you know, and, and, and we will 
[00:37:30]  move on.  But when you look at people using office chairs as stretchers and, uh, pickup trucks being  used as ambulance, you realize, you know, it doesn't even come down to the fact that  we're the USA and we're rich and powerful.  It's all just the people making do with what they got, just like, uh, any other people in  that situation would do.  You know, you like to think some miracle is going to happen and we're going to have these  stretch ambulance show up or something, but it's just not that way.  And, and a lot of people didn't realize this until yesterday. 
[00:38:00]  Uh, Rob, New York city cop.  What's up?  Hey, how are you guys?  Listen, uh, I was working here last night.  I was on a 57th street, probably right in front of the studio.  And, uh, I gotta say, it was like you guys are saying, it was surreal.  I mean, I got home at like five o'clock in the morning, not a cloud in the sky and beautiful  night.  And all I can think of, our world has changed, uh, you know, to no end.  It's never going to be the same.  You know, it's always going to be, uh, you're always going to have this in the back of your  mind.  This is going to, just like the Pearl Harbor of our generation, what all of us kept saying. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  We were just in shock.  Uh, yeah, it's, it's just overwhelming.  I mean, most of us will get that phone call.  How many, how many of you guys are, you know, you hear the phone ring at home.  You're like, oh no, here it comes.  Here it comes.  You know what it is?  It's over the next, uh, few weeks when they start releasing names, you're going to realize,  I mean, I play hockey in a cop-finding league and I know there's guys that I'm never  going to see again and it's, uh, it hasn't hit home yet.  Like you're starting to call friends up.  Hey, you spoke to this guy yet?  Oh yeah.  We heard from him.  You know, we heard from him, but somewhere down the line, you're going to see somebody 
[00:39:00]  and say, Hey, whatever happened to so-and-so?  And he's going to be like, no, he's, uh, he was in the blast.  And, uh, that's when it's going to start hitting home.  You're going to see a lot of horses around the neighborhood.  A lot of families, like you guys talk about Hoboken, you know, communities are just going  to be gone, destroyed.  And, uh, it's going to get worse before it gets better.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, there are families out there that are so desperate for information.  They're, they're putting websites up with pictures of their loved one going, Hey, has  anyone seen this guy? 
[00:39:30]  We haven't heard from him yet.  Right.  We, uh, Ben was showing us a couple of those in the back office.  I don't, I don't know how much more of this crap I could take.  Yeah.  You know, it's just, it just rips you hard.  I just took the LAE and then, uh, it was like exactly what you were saying.  You put it great was, uh, it's a ghost.  I mean, you look there where the two beautiful buildings should be and that smoke just does  not want to go away.  It's just there as a reminder of what used to be and, uh, how it's going to be.  It's just, it's heart wrenching.  It's like the worst day.  This has got to be the worst day of my life. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  And part of you is thinking, you know, that didn't really happen when the, when the smoke  clears, the tower is going to be there.  It's behind the smoke.  Yeah.  It's right there.  We just can't see it yet.  I was saying yesterday, it was like when the Challenger exploded.  Uh, you, you, you didn't want to believe that it had exploded and everyone in there  had died, you know?  Thank you, guys.  You wanted to think that something was, uh, something that was going to save them.  All right, Bob, we're going to let you go.  You're breaking up a little bit, okay?  All right, guys.  Thank you and God bless everyone.  All right.  We're going to move on to, uh, Marty, who's friends with Billy Mack, a friend of the radio 
[00:40:30]  show.  He's a New York City detective.  Uh, Marty, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  What's happening today?  Hey.  All right.  Uh, you know, I was down there last night, uh, what could you say?  Uh, a lot of devastation.  Yeah.  Something I've never seen before in, uh, the years I've been on this job.  And, uh, I hopefully never have to see it again.  Yeah, well, you know, I'm, I'm sick of the, the mainstream media going, uh, asking people  down there, so, so how do you prepare for something like this? 
[00:41:00]  You don't teach classes in this.  You don't prepare.  Shut up with the stupid questions.  Yeah, they're at the point now in the, uh, network newscasts and whatnot that they're  just starting to ask the real inane, uh, asking questions, like, how do you prepare for this?  Oh, there's a class we take in horror.  You know, there's no really class you take.  I mean, you just, you just hope for the best and you hope you're ready for when these things  happen.  I mean, last night we were standing down there on, uh, Albany and Greenwich Street, most of  it was around 10 o'clock and we're watching all the firemen running, uh, running up onto 
[00:41:30]  the rubble of what used to be, you know, the World Trade Center and searching for people.  And, uh, unfortunately I didn't see anybody being pulled out last night because there was,  it was just shortly after they were able to get up onto the rubble.  But we're standing on the corner and, uh, a fireman comes walking by us, a young guy,  uh, and he comes up to us and he just happens to ask us how we're doing, how's everything  going tonight.  We tell him, you know, everything's as best as can be expected for now.  And we ask him the same, you know, how are you doing tonight?  How are your guys? 
[00:42:00]  He turns around and he says to us, uh, they're all dead.  Yeah.  And, uh, I mean, what, what do you say to a guy like that?  Yeah.  Nothing.  That walks up to you and tells you that everybody he was with, uh, is dead except for himself.  And there's nothing, uh, nothing anyone can do about it.  No.  And he just goes wandering off down, down the street like he's, uh, you know, he's trying  to find some kind of reason why this all happened.  Well, we have to, uh, we have to do something to make sure this doesn't, that doesn't happen  again, all the reports that are coming in about how they, uh, a couple of them learned  how to fly in a school in Florida. 
[00:42:30]  At a day total, yeah.  Over a year ago.  They had enrolled in this school.  This had been going on, this plan had been going on for over a year.  And they were using the resources of this country to construct the plan of, of destruction  that, that went down yesterday.  And, and how we didn't find out about this, how they kept this a secret, a huge undertaking  that was, uh, trained in Florida.  These, these guys, these pilots in Florida.  And how did we not know about it? 
[00:43:00]  Where was the intelligence?  Uh, I just go to show you how vulnerable we really are.  You can't, you can't predict when it's going to happen.  Hey, you know, and, uh, said it best yesterday.  I think he was one of the first guys to say it about the Pentagon.  We all grew up thinking that if, if there was any threat to the Pentagon or any, any building  in Washington, the grounds would open up with this just amazing, you know, force.  Right.  You always thought something.  Nobody could ever get there.  Right.  There's lasers in there.  You know, you always hear the urban legends about how, uh, the Pentagon and the White House 
[00:43:30]  and the Capitol all have these defense systems, uh, built in that nothing could penetrate  it.  But you know something, uh, they could have picked any one of those buildings and, and,  uh, devastated any of them.  There's, we, we, we are a lot, uh, uh, we're, we're kind of more vulnerable than, than we  thought.  That's, this is true.  I'll tell you, but I, I'm proud to be a New Yorker and I'm proud to be a New York City  detective.  The things I saw last night from, from people, civilians walking around, doctors who came 
[00:44:00]  there on their own time, just walking through the crowds of people to try to help people.  Yeah.  People bringing us water and offering us things.  Uh, deli owners opening up the stores and saying, listen guys, if you're hungry, please  come and grab something to eat.  Yeah.  The city has turned into, I think I heard on, uh, Don and Mike, uh, the city has really  turned into a, a small town.  I mean, it's, it's amazing.  You can walk by the same shops every day and never talk to anyone.  Yeah.  And today people are coming out of their, uh, out of their, uh, shops and, and seeing what  they can do. 
[00:44:30]  And it's, you know, that's a, it's, it's nice to see that.  It's nice to see it.  It's a typical New York story.  Everybody pulling together as one.  You know what though?  I, I really can't wait till we get to the point where we hate each other again, because  then we'll be back to normal.  Then we'll know there's normalcy, uh, back in this city again when we can just turn around  and hate each other.  Then we know we can move on with our radio show.  Move on.  That's it.  Yeah.  All right, gentlemen, have a nice day.  All right, man.  Cool.  Speaking of that, like the, uh, uh, uh, hatred and, uh, uh, I was at a gas station filling 
[00:45:00]  up on my way in and there was a guy, obviously Middle Eastern guy that was working at this  gas station and very nervous.  And I'd seen him in the past.  I, I guess up there very nervous.  And, uh, when I paid him, uh, I asked him what the credit card, uh, swipe through on the  pumps isn't working.  And with a very put on, uh, American accent, he said, no, that is broken.  Like he was trying not to have an accent.  Middle Eastern or whatever.  And I had heard him talk before, you know, he was putting this on and he was genuinely 
[00:45:30]  scared.  Uh, I passed by some cab drivers that, you know, wear turbans.  I could see their hair had like, from wearing turbans for years, they had turban head, turban  head, turban head, and the big beard and whatnot.  But, you know, they were not wearing their turbans today and just really stopping at lights  and eyeing around.  Because there have been reports that people have started assaulting, uh, people of, of  Middle Eastern descent.  Well, what do you think of, uh, what's going on in Patterson, New Jersey in the Arabic community? 
[00:46:00]  They're celebrating over there.  In our country, they're celebrating.  Dispicable, disgusting people.  How do you not go over there and, and, you know, crush some skulls?  You know, they're over here.  And they're so happy.  I would love to see those same people go down to the World Trade Center area and celebrate  down there.  Yeah.  Let's see how brave they really are.  They, uh, they enjoy the fruits of this country and then, uh, spit in everyone's face by celebrate.  How do you celebrate something like that?  Awful. 
[00:46:30]  Awful people.  Just despicable.  You know, but what comes around will truly go around.  And I can only hope that, uh, this government and the military really do what's necessary.  To just nip this in the bud right now.  All right.  Irene, what's up?  Hi.  Hi, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  I just wanted to, um, I work at Chase Manhattan Plaza, which is literally two blocks up.  It's right there.  From there.  And I was there yesterday. 
[00:47:00]  And the experience of being that close was horrifying.  Yeah, I bet.  You could tell just by.  The window.  You know.  You could see the plane.  Clash right into the building.  You saw the second plane?  You saw the second plane.  And the entire floor.  I work at the conference center at J.P. Morgan Chase.  And, uh, the entire floor just screamed.  People started running out of the building.  And, uh, we had to get everybody who didn't work there out. 
[00:47:30]  And, uh, it was horrifying.  Then, we're sitting there watching.  They wouldn't, after we got everyone out, you know, the building wasn't officially evacuated.  And so, we're sitting there watching the news.  And all of a sudden, the sky gets dark.  And someone screamed, holy S.  And all we see are parts of bricks, body parts, coming towards the window.  And it was just horrifying.  And, uh, that's wonderful. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, I'm just, uh, yeah.  I mean, I'm still disgusted and stunned.  There's nothing.  I mean, it was the most, we finally evacuated.  And, uh, we got outside.  It was pitch black.  It looked like a total war zone.  I mean, everyone was covered in ash.  I mean, I live in Staten Island.  There was no way for me to get home.  I had to walk to Brooklyn, through Brooklyn, to the Veradamil Bridge.  Because I refused to get on a train. 
[00:48:30]  You know what a lot of people don't realize?  When you watch the videos and you see that, uh, rolling, what looks like an avalanche of white, uh, uh, soot, uh, and, and debris going down the street.  Inside that cloud, it's glass.  It is not, but it is not white.  It, it looks like, oh, it'll be like a whiteout around me.  It blocks out every bit of light.  The only reason it looks white is because the sun's reflecting off of the top of it and the outside.  But once you're inside, it is pitch black.  There was a, uh, video clip of a guy with a camcorder that got engulfed in this cloud. 
[00:49:00]  And, uh, he said, you could hear the audio.  He goes, I don't know if I'm blind right now.  He goes, it's, I can't see anything.  He goes, I think I've been, I've been blinded.  But the fact was, he'd just been in this cloud where no light came in.  It was pitch black.  Yeah, exactly.  And, I mean, just to feel, I mean, when you saw the plane crashes, you, our whole building, the building shook.  We thought it was an explosion on, inside, on, in our building.  And it was just like, oh, my God, what's going on? 
[00:49:30]  When the first plane hit, we didn't realize it.  We thought something, you know, there was an explosion.  There's legal paperwork hitting our window.  We could read the paperwork.  We could see who these people were.  We could see their access.  There's a name on paperwork going by our window.  A lot of people didn't know that first explosion was a plane because a lot of people weren't really looking up there until they heard the explosion.  And they didn't know what it was.  But then when everyone's attention was grabbed and you're looking at the fireball and you saw that second plane go in, then everybody was like, uh-oh, this is a terrorist attack and the real deal. 
[00:50:00]  And that's when I think people really started trying to get out of those buildings.  But, yeah.  Exactly.  I mean, the eyewitness accounts in the New York papers, I've got to say it again, if you're in another city, try to pick up the New York papers because some of the reading is just unbelievable.  There you had a story of one guy, you know, when the tower started collapsing.  He started running.  You just start running. 
[00:50:30]  You don't know which way you should run, right?  Right.  And now he's thinking, is this thing going to fall over like a tree?  Do I have to try to outrun 110 stories?  You know what I mean?  He had no clue that it was collapsing within itself, you know, which was a problem right there.  But he wasn't sure if the damn thing was falling over like a tree right toward him.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was just very scary, very sad.  I mean, I just hope they just find out exactly what I just annihilate all of them at this point.  Yeah, well, there's a lot of anger there, yeah. 
[00:51:00]  Just annihilate them.  I mean, it was unnecessary.  They're daycare centers in those buildings.  Yeah, what I'm hearing, though, is those were evacuated right away.  Yeah, they accounted for all the kids, thank God.  But I'm going to go, guys.  Okay, Irene.  Bye, Irene.  Thanks for sharing with us today, all right?  All right.  Bye.  There's some FAA regulations that have just started.  Curbside check-in, gone.  Permanently.  That's it.  No more of the curbside check-in.  All bags subject to multiple searches throughout the airport, which means you could just be walking around, going to the bar. 
[00:51:30]  Hey, let me see your bag.  You know, let me search your bag.  Only ticketed passengers allowed in the boarding area.  Random multiple ID checks held throughout the airport at all times.  Again, a guy can just walk up to you.  Let me see your ID.  And I have no problem with any of these.  This is fine by me.  I don't care.  The only carry-on luggage, I applaud this.  Small purse or briefcase, anything larger like a backpack, check it.  I like that, too.  Why the hell?  There's no reason you have to bring huge bags in to carry-on. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, you'll have tons of people complaining at the airport.  Yeah.  Oh, let me just...  No, I'll put it here.  I'll put...  No.  Check it.  Get off the plane.  No knives of any kind allowed past security.  It includes small knives like Swiss Army knives.  First-class passengers.  Back to plastic knives.  Remember?  They give you the metal knife that you can cut your tough steak with.  It's up-secure, you know?  Yeah.  We let our guard down.  It's so funny.  We talk about Star Wars and all that, and this was done with box cutters.  Yeah, box cutters.  Holy ass.  A couple more, because all luggage is going to be searched several times. 
[00:52:30]  FAA recommends you travel light when flying.  The more luggage you have, it'll slow you down more.  And the FAA recommends, because of the searches, you arrive three hours early before a regular domestic flight.  It was two hours before an international flight.  Now it's three hours before a domestic flight.  So we'll see how long people do this before it becomes a big inconvenience.  Yeah, let's see how much patience the American people really have.  They say they have it. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  Brian, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  You're on the radio, Brian.  Yes, I'm on the radio.  I was in a building yesterday.  I was on the 70th floor in the Tower 2, the second tower to have been hit.  And I guess I'll just give you the, you know, sort of the blow-by-blow of what I experienced.  Okay.  You know, I got in early.  I usually get in about 8.20, and I was reading.  And about 8.45, I looked at the clock on my phone, and I saw it was, you know, close to quarter to nine. 
[00:53:30]  And then, you know, seconds later, I heard this tremendous, you know, sort of booming noise.  And my first thought, you know, the first thought that I had was that somewhere down the hallway, like a series of, we have these big file cabinets on the floor.  And I thought, you know, it was totally irrational.  But I just thought, well, it sounded like a series of file cabinets had fallen over. 
[00:54:00]  Is that what it sounded like?  Well, I mean, that was, you know, thinking back, that's not really what it sounded like.  But I was, I couldn't have imagined.  It popped in your head, right?  Yeah, I couldn't have imagined that it was an explosion in the other tower, so.  What floor were you on?  I was on the 70th floor.  70th?  Yeah.  Okay.  I didn't know if you said that earlier.  Yeah, and I was in the second tower.  And, all right.  So, when that noise happened, I mean, you know, this silly thought that I was having, like, oh, you know, shoot a file cabinet has fallen.  And then I hear this guy down the hall from me, who has a window office.  I was in a cubicle.  This guy who has a window office, I hear his voice, you know, and this will echo in my mind forever. 
[00:54:30]  He just starts, oh, God, oh, dear God.  He's shouting this, you know, and it's just, it's the only, you know, voice I hear.  And then when it hit me that, you know, something, you know, significant may have happened.  And me and two other guys went to look out the window, and we saw, you know, at that, then we saw that the other tower was actually on fire.  And that, you know, the sky was sort of filled with, you know, the woman earlier was describing that these papers went through the air. 
[00:55:00]  It was like papers and smoke.  Wow.  And, you know, this other guy, this guy, Mike, that I work with just goes, you know, that building's on fire.  It was just, he said it as though he was just like, you know, we're all kind of crap.  Yeah, like, no crap, we're looking at it.  Yeah, we were looking at it.  But you had to say it just to make it real.  Yeah, exactly, exactly.  What did you do?  Did you instantly go, I'm getting the hell out of here?  Well, then, no.  See, then we all sort of, we didn't know what had happened. 
[00:55:30]  And then we all kind of, the people from other departments, we all kind of congregated in the hallway, the center hallway there near the elevator and the fire escape stairwell.  Yeah.  And, you know, we all sort of stood around, not knowing what to do for about five minutes, I'd say,  and sort of made sure that everyone we knew who we had seen that morning was accounted for.  And then we, at that point, entered the stairwell.  Well, you know, and we just began walking, you know, this narrow fire escape stairwell was just, you know, thousands of people. 
[00:56:00]  Right.  And it opened the door, and instantly we just saw a cavalcade, you know, a cascade of human bodies.  And that's when you decided you were just getting out of there.  Yeah.  And then, yeah.  How long after you left the door did the building come down?  Uh, after I left the, um, when I got out on the ground?  Yeah.  Um, I'd, maybe ten minutes.  Ten minutes.  And were there still a lot of people behind you, or a lot of people trying to get out? 
[00:56:30]  Uh, I guess I assumed that there had to have been.  Yeah.  Because, you know, you would look up and just see bodies, and look down and just see bodies in the stairwell.  And, uh, I guess I was about the, um, uh, well, at one point, an announcement came on.  I guess it was about, we were close to the 59th or 55th floor, and an announcement came on.  It said, you know, Port Authority, uh, uh, came over to the speaker and said, Building 2 is secure, you know.  Jeez, man.  How many people did that kill?  Uh, well, yeah, that's the thing.  And I guess I, I can't really, you know, from their perspective, from their point of view, it was secure. 
[00:57:00]  Because there was kind of a rumor, it was a, that there, a plane had hit the building, no one knew for sure.  Yeah, that's just it.  No one knew that it was a plane.  Yeah, and, and even when, you know, thinking that it was a plane, it was like, oh, well, this has been just a terrible accident.  So, you know, this can't possibly be happening, you know, in ten minutes.  Ten minutes later, it's going to happen again.  You know something, though?  An inferno in a building right next to the one you're in, I would, I would just have to take the day off.  Maybe I'm just lazy, and I would love to just have the day off. 
[00:57:30]  But an inferno in the building right next to mine, I'd leave the building.  I don't care if I heard, this building's secure.  Now, you know something?  Yeah, I mean, it wasn't.  I'm leaving.  It's time to go get a cup of coffee and some fresh air.  Right.  Call me a pussy.  It was right.  I have to say, it wasn't the most reassuring message.  You know, building to a secure, and so we got off on the 55th floor, because, you know, you can't get back through the doors.  And on every floor.  So we got off on, I think it was 55, and this guy sort of came running to us. 
[00:58:00]  I was with my friend Brian.  We were walking down.  A bunch of people were walking together, and this guy's, like, screaming.  You know, I've just seen people jumping from the other building.  And so, you know, at that time, you know, we just were like, okay, yeah, we're just going to continue on down.  Yeah.  And I guess I was on, like, I'd say the 45th floor when the, you know, the second plane hit.  When it hit your building.  Right.  And what did that feel like?  That was far more, you know, intense than hearing it from across the other building. 
[00:58:30]  I mean, there was this tremendous explosion.  And what was the sound?  Like a twisting metal?  Did you hear a...  No, it was just more like a really deep sonic boom.  And right as that happened, we were all in the fire escape stairwell.  And, you know, it was hot from the body heat of all these thousands of people.  And the building, at that point, just began rocking and playing.  Oh, man.  Like a ride at the carnival. 
[00:59:00]  So you're trying to walk down these stairs.  And are you actually going back and forth against the railing at all?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And at that point, you know, as that happened, you know, it was not like I thought I was going to die.  But it was more like I was just filled with...  I just became...  I went into this, you know, strange zone of consciousness where I was certain that I was just about to die.  Wow.  There was no question in my mind.  That's a great feeling to have, huh? 
[00:59:30]  No, I've had better feelings on the scale of feelings, the whole broad spectrum.  But, you know, at that time, and then I said to my friend Brian, I said, are we being bombed?  What the hell?  Yeah, exactly.  Because now it's, you know, now it's your building.  And did you think you were being bombed?  Did you think it was terrorists?  No, I didn't then.  I would probably assume that whatever was burning in the other building had exploded.  And it kind of hit your building. 
[01:00:00]  That's what, yeah, that's what we sort of figured.  My friend Brian said, no, I think that was a fuel tank from the plane that crashed into the other building.  Ah.  And which, you know, sounded perfectly reasonable.  Yeah, because the last thing you're thinking is people are aiming planes at your building.  You know, that's really, I mean, that's really what it is.  It's just no one, we're all in the fire escape.  And, of course, no one is going to assume that this is happening.  Right.  And so the building, it sort of kind of stopped.  I mean, the violent, the motions, you know, the rocking motion was pretty violent at first. 
[01:00:30]  Were people just in a complete panic in the stairwell, you know, running over each other?  No, no, you know, I have to say that it could very well have just become chaos.  And I could, people were crying and praying to God and just talking out loud.  And, you know, there was a lot of that, but.  How about talk and pray outside?  Shake your ass down those stairs.  You know, but we could only move so quickly.  That's because people are crying and praying.  Move.  Yeah, right.  Oh, my God.  I would, I would, I'd be one of those guys pushing people out of the way. 
[01:01:00]  Let me out of here.  I know, but.  Like, I couldn't take that.  There was none of that.  And I'm just amazed.  And at times there would be some, it would become so congested that, you know, we couldn't go any further.  And people above would start screaming, move, move.  Yeah, I get pissed on the line when, you know, hey, the trailers are starting in the movie theater.  And, you know, somebody's taking too long to get in.  Yeah.  That pisses me off.  Never mind a life or death situation.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  And so, and then we just, right, we just started counting the floors. 
[01:01:30]  You know, it's like 32.  Oh, I hear.  I mean, you don't know what's, did the building do anything else on your way down that led you to believe that it might actually collapse?  No, no, no.  Right after the, after it stopped swaying, I kind of, I mean, I didn't feel much more secure, but it didn't, it didn't, there was nothing that gave me any indication that it was going to collapse.  And, and now you, you got, how'd you feel, obviously, uh, great when you got out?  Oh, yeah.  But, uh, what, when you, when you looked up, uh, when you got out, what were you thinking? 
[01:02:00]  What were you saying?  Um, well, when we, we exited, you know, there's that Borders bookstore right there.  Mm-hmm.  And that's where we came up through.  And we were all sort of just, you know, going single, you know, this, you know, big long line.  And, and the emergency workers, you know, the cops and the rescue workers were screaming, you know, do not look up.  Whatever you do, do not look up.  Yeah, because stuff is just coming down.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So then I crossed, yeah, I crossed a church, I think it's church street, you know, and I'm, I'm sort of walking up to Broadway.  And then I, I turned around and, and what I saw, you know, I saw both of the, of the twin towers smoking and flaming. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  And, uh, it, it looked like a special effect from a, from a diehard movie.  It, it looked like something that, that I was, you know, seeing.  I wasn't even in my body as I was seeing.  No, not at all.  I, I, you know, no one could believe their eyes.  So how, how close were you when the building collapsed?  Uh, I don't know.  I really don't know.  Did you keep moving away from the building?  You know, and then, yeah, I did because I met up with, uh, um, I sort of lost my friend in the shuffle. 
[01:03:00]  Then I met up with my other friend, this girl named Lauren.  And, um, I said, you know, we were so dazed and I said, what do you want to do?  And she goes, I just want to, you know, I want to keep, I want to keep walking.  Yeah.  We started, we started walking north and we didn't stop.  I mean, and, you know, we were, as we were walking up to Broadway, we were seeing blood in the streets, you know, and, and debris and things like that.  Now, when, when it finally did collapse, did you know it collapsed?  Were you able to see it?  No.  Well, when the first, when, when our building collapsed, our building was the first one to collapse.  We didn't know because we just, we're still walking north. 
[01:03:30]  And then we, we sort of stopped, um, we, we, we made some phone calls and called our parents, um, and then we kept going and we stopped, uh, on Broadway and 10th Street.  And, you know, there's this sort of, what was once this magnificent view of, of the ark at Washington Square Park.  Yeah.  You know, with the towers behind it.  And we saw, you know, one world trade and we thought that our building was shrouded in smoke.  But it was gone.  Right.  We couldn't see it.  And then we, we watched as, as that building collapsed. 
[01:04:00]  And, um.  And, and just, you know, I can't even imagine what you were thinking knowing that minutes earlier you were in there.  Um, yeah, that's something that, I, I mean, I'm not sure, I, I think I still may be in shock.  Yeah, I, I think so.  You, you're like those people that are survivors of a plane crash or, uh, uh, some kind of a cataclysmic event.  Uh, you know, I'm sure you go through the, the mindset of what if.  Right.  You know, what if I, I didn't, uh, uh, decide to leave or what if I went upstairs, uh, you know? 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, well, if, um, the, the plane hit, you know, right near our floor, the 70th floor.  And, I mean, time just became this, we didn't know it, but time became this, this crucial, precious factor.  Right.  I mean, if we had lingered, there was only 18 minutes between the crashes and a flight.  Now, you, you did wait for a little while before you did decide to leave.  Yeah, well, I'd say we, we sort of waited in the hallway for about five minutes or so.  What, what finally made you decide that that was the time to get out, though?  Um.  I'm sure you've been hashing that over your head. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, we just, we were just standing there looking at one another, and some people were already crying.  And it just sort of struck us all collectively, like a series of light bulbs above our heads.  Like, okay, now.  Let's just go.  Now we're going right now.  Well, thank God for you, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, and, um.  Jeez, that's an incredible story, Brian.  Yeah.  So, and, you know, for a while, you know, as Lorna and I were walking, we were thinking,  oh, uh, you know, I wonder how long it's going to take before they, they repair our offices.  Repair them.  Yeah, I mean, because.  Because you can't, you can't imagine.  Right, right.  And we're like, oh, well, I guess we'll be out of work for the next, you know, month or two. 
[01:05:30]  And then, you know, we just saw the tower collapse.  And then I said, okay, but where's the other one?  And this woman on the street said, they're both gone.  Wow.  And, um, you know.  Now, Brian, what, um, what, ah, God damn, I forgot what I was going to ask him.  It was, uh, you're up there in the house.  I wanted to ask him, but.  Does that have anything to do with the, the, uh, planes crashing in the trade center yesterday?  Yeah, something about that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jeez.  Did you sleep last night, Brian? 
[01:06:00]  I'm not going to hang up, I'm sure.  Um, I did sleep last night.  Um, I, I was on the phone all day.  Mm-hmm.  And that's, that's another thing that I want to, I want to talk about is, at some point  later in the day, I, I went out to my, uh, my friend's house in New Jersey.  Um, you know, after Lorna and I, we had walked from the World Trade Center to 65th and West  End Avenue, um, which is where her dad's office was.  And, um, from there, um, I got a ride to New Jersey and I checked my messages later.  Um, and, um, it was, it was, it was surreal because, you know, I talked to my mom and she 
[01:06:30]  knew I was alive.  Uh-huh.  That's, she's the first person I called, but people were leaving, um, messages on my  machine as though I were dead.  Oh, my God.  Um, you know, there were people crying and, um, you know, uh, you know, telling me that  they loved me.  And I'm listening to, I'm listening to this and, and, you know, having seen the footage  now, um, you know, I, I, I can, I can understand that they, they, they, they probably thought  there's no way that anyone could. 
[01:07:00]  Anyone could get a, have you talked to, uh, that's what I meant to ask you.  Have you talked to people that you work with, uh, yeah, I've talked to some of the people.  Pretty much, I think everyone in my department is accounted for.  Great.  Um, and I talked to the guy, um, that, you know, I walked down with those 70 flights  and, you know, we both sort of talked about how, you know, when we heard that explosion,  we felt the building, um, shutter.  We, we had the same thought.  We didn't say it at the time, but, you know, talking about it later, we both, we both thought  that right then we were going to die. 
[01:07:30]  Um, and, and it was good to talk to him and I've talked to some other people and, um, I guess  that's all you can do, uh, for, for a long time is just, it's just kind of talk about  it and, and try and process it because I still, I, I'm still not sure that I really even understand  the enormity of, uh, you know, of what happened and in my life and the lives of, of everyone  who was there and everyone in the city.  Um, and I just want to say also that, you know, the people who were, who were escorting 
[01:08:00]  us out of the building, I mean, those people, I mean, I can't, they're heroes.  Um, they, they were just reacting in, in such a, they were so effective and efficient  and, you know, it was just, I can't, I can't praise them.  Yeah.  Like I said earlier, these are people that are doing things that go against every instinct  you have for survival.  Yeah, exactly.  And they put themselves in that situation and it's so upsetting that this scum of the earth  can, can, uh, do stuff that just wipes their lives out like that. 
[01:08:30]  And, uh, somebody like you that was directly affected by this, how do you feel about the  people that did it and, and what kind of response would you like to see?  I know it's early, like you said, you're still processing what happened to you, but, but how  do you feel about this and, and what would you like to see?  Um, I mean, I, I, I really, I have been thinking about that because I've been watching these politicians,  um, you know, on television and I really would like to see some kind of swift, you know, decisive,  uh, action and I've never really been someone like that. 
[01:09:00]  I, you know, um, it wasn't like during desert storm, I had a yellow ribbon on my car antenna.  I mean, I, I, you know, I'm a patriotic person, but it's never been like, but I do feel a kind  of fervor about this.  I mean, I, I, I'm incensed, um, that, I mean, I just wonder what kind of psychotic crazed  person would, would just fly an airplane.  Is it more personal because you were affected directly or is it something, uh, that, that you  just want to see taken care of once and for all?  Um, no, it's not really.  Like a personal vendetta, like this son of a bitch almost killed me. 
[01:09:30]  It's, it, it's not so much a personal vendetta.  I don't really feel like, um, you know, I, I want, um, uh, you know, uh, action taken  just, just for me personally.  It's just, I, I do want, I do want something done, but I also have to say that, I mean, I,  I have been disheartened watching the president on television because I, I saw him in his  two little, um, you know, press speeches or press conferences and it's so clear to me  that he, he's looking down, reading notes.  Yeah, I want some, some genuine human pissed off at this. 
[01:10:00]  This is a time, this is a time to speak from the hearts.  Yeah.  Like cue cards and your, and your speech writers, you know, talk to us.  Yes, that's, yeah, that's exactly right.  I've seen other people like Colin Powell and Giuliani.  They've been great.  Um, they've been talking, but I don't, I don't get the sense.  I mean, I know that George, uh, Bush, and I'm sure he means, you know, what he's saying,  but just to see him read these lines has been somewhat, uh, you know, depressing.  I, I guess their mindset too is that the president has to remain like he's, uh, totally in control 
[01:10:30]  and unflappable.  Yes, so, you know, I want to see some genuine, uh, emotion from this guy.  We're all pissed off.  It's okay for you to be too, you know what I mean?  And, and, and let's, let's, uh, uh, deal with this and, uh, uh, nip this in the bud.  Yeah, I, yeah, that's, that's what I've been thinking as I've been watching him.  And, and on one sense, I, I do feel like, um, you know, you know, he and these people,  they, they have this under control.  Um, but I just want, I, I would like to hear, uh, something from his heart. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  All right, Brian.  Uh, and what a story, man.  Brian is Steve Lynch's, uh, good friend here.  Really?  Steve Lynch is in the studio.  Yeah, yeah.  Both, uh, Kalamazoo boys.  It's a miracle.  I gotta, I gotta say, when, uh, we have a mutual friend who called me as soon as the  first plane hit and said, Brian's in that building.  So I went over to her place immediately.  And, uh, I, I feel weird saying this in front of Brian, but with each subsequent incident,  I was more and more sure that he was dead.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  I mean, how do you not, when the second plane hits, it's like, all right, he was in one 
[01:11:30]  of those buildings.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When the building comes down, you're like, there's a 50-50 chance, if that, that he's alive.  Right.  Then the second one comes down and you're not hearing anything from anybody.  Yeah.  I never thought I'd hear that.  Yeah, well, I heard, I mean, I did hear a lot of that.  I mean, my friend in Chicago was watching it and, and just as he was watching the towers  burn, he was sort of rationalizing, oh, he could be below this or he could have gotten  out already.  But then just to watch on television as they both collapsed.  Thank God they lasted as long as they did.  Yeah.  I mean, it's a testament to those buildings that they didn't just immediately collapse 
[01:12:00]  from the damage of the plane and the, the explosion and all that jet fuel exploding,  that they didn't instantly just pancake on themselves, that they stood there long enough  that, you know, you, Brian, and, and a lot of other people, thank God, were able to get  out of there and, uh, keep it from even being a bigger loss of life.  That's what it, what it, what it felt like when I was in the stairwell and the, and the  plane hit my building, it did feel like the building was just going to topple over.  Man, I can't, I can't even imagine.  All right, Brian. 
[01:12:30]  All right.  Well, thanks a lot, guys.  And, um, you know, uh, I'm still here and a lot of people are still here and, um, you  know, we're just, uh, just do it.  Do you drink, Brian?  Uh, I did last night.  Yeah.  I would recommend it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dr. Anthony says drink.  Well, uh, yeah, I'll try and attend to that prescription right now.  All right, Brian, man.  Thanks so much.  There are so many stories to get to Anthony.  I mean, we've been on an hour and 10 minutes straight.  There's no reason to take a break.  There's no reason to go to, you know, local news.  No, no, no.  Let's, uh, keep going. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, yeah.  One thing to add with the patience factor, people still have no patience.  This morning on Houston Street, which is where all the trucks and everything is stored,  which is, you know, 20, 25 blocks away from the scene, there's still people arguing with  the NYPD about trying to get into that area in Soho.  So I'm watching, I'm walking around at like nine o'clock this morning, and this dude is  like, well, I need to get to work in Soho.  And the cop is like, well, just show me your ID.  He doesn't have it.  And the cop's like, listen, I've been ordered by the president of the United States and the 
[01:13:30]  governor.  I can't allow you down there.  And the guy's giving them crap.  And it's like, it's only 24 hours later, and this dude's trying to get down there.  Yeah, let these guys do their jobs.  Crazy.  Uh, Lisa's really upset on line nine.  Lisa.  Hi, Elf.  Hi, Ann.  How are you?  Hey, what's up?  All right.  What's wrong?  Um, my parents were flying from Rome to Newark Airport, and they were supposed to land yesterday  on flight 41.  Okay.  And apparently their flight got rerouted, and they had to go back to Rome, according to  Confidential.  But they won't give me any information on how to get in touch with my parents. 
[01:14:00]  And I, uh, the phones have been up and down, and I don't know why they haven't gotten in  touch with me if they can't.  But I work in the New York area.  I'd like to let them know that I'm okay.  But Confidential won't even tell me.  They said, we put them up in a hotel.  They're fine.  Won't give me the hotel information, anything.  Now, this is a flight from Rome.  They were coming here.  They were coming back.  They were on vacation in Rome.  Yeah, I think only domestic flights that were, um, coming in are going to be allowed 
[01:14:30]  to land, and they sent back all the international flights.  Well, I think some of them went to Canada.  Went to Canada, but, yeah, they turned them around.  Well, they're fine.  You know, they, you know.  I want to talk to them and tell them I'm fine, you know.  Yeah, I don't blame you, but I'm sure they're fine.  They're hanging out for a while.  Yeah.  Well, you don't, you don't know how to get in touch with them.  Well, it's just another one of those things.  Well, at least, you know, they're fine and you're fine, and eventually you two will hook  up and, uh, do that huggy-kissing thing.  Oh, I just hope they're not in Rome all worried about me and my sister. 
[01:15:00]  Mm, yeah.  Wow, that's, you know.  I don't know what to say.  I know there's nothing to do, but wait.  I don't have any powers over Confidential, do you?  No.  Okay.  If something happens, we'll announce it on the radio.  That's the best I can tell you, but, uh.  You know, you do hold a huge party at their house, because they can't be  filled with you when they get home.  Right.  Right?  Well, if someone from Continental knows, then they can call you and tell you, and I'll  keep listening.  Okay.  If anyone where, I understand all the people from Rome are put in one hotel, they just 
[01:15:30]  can't give me the name of the hotel.  Please.  All right.  Please.  If we find the name, we'll announce it, I guess.  Thank you so much, guys.  All right, Lisa.  Talk to you soon.  Love you.  Hang in there.  Bye.  All right.  Let's go to a New Jersey cop.  Bob, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, O'Neill?  Thanks for having me.  I don't know.  This is just so crazy, man.  Yeah.  You're working late?  Uh, I actually just got out of work, but, uh, I've been on desk duty, and, uh, it's weird.  Just, uh, you see the news, you know, all the news footage, but at the same time, you 
[01:16:00]  see all the telepipes coming in from missing persons all over the state.  You know, for, uh, you know, people who are over there, you know, place last seen, World  Trade Center.  And it's just, I mean, it's, I can't describe it.  The numbers when they finally come out are going to be just ridiculous.  Just ridiculous.  Yeah.  Well, it's, it's time to do something.  Oh, absolutely.  It's time to do something, something huge, and, uh, you know, we got to make a statement.  Like I said, this has, this can't be business as usual, and the way we've, we've handled 
[01:16:30]  this in the past, even though we have bombed in the past, and, you know, I don't, I don't  really know what that does.  That's why I, I was saying we need some kind of a low-yield tactical nuclear strike against  Afghanistan, who has, uh, uh, put this bin Laden's clown, uh, up for years.  Absolutely.  And it would teach other countries that if they harbor these people and support them, that,  oh my God, we might get nuked?  You know, who's going to take the next guy if they think that might happen? 
[01:17:00]  So, it's got to be such a huge response that, uh, no one would want to, uh, uh, support  these people.  Agreed.  All right, Bob, thank you.  All right, take care, guys.  Get this, Palestinian President Yasser Arafat donated blood Wednesday for victims of the  terror attacks in New York and Washington.  Yasser, don't worry about donating blood.  We'll, we'll take enough of yours when the time comes.  How's he donating blood? 
[01:17:30]  That is, uh, that is an effort to, uh, fend off an attack that he knows is imminent.  Clown.  John from the New York City Fire Department.  John.  How you doing, guys?  All right.  No answer to that.  Hello?  Yeah, what's up, John?  How you doing?  Yeah.  What do you got?  I just want to say, I'm a New York City Fireman.  I was there yesterday, and, uh, it was the worst thing I ever saw.  I mean, uh, the company just got wiped out.  It's just terrible.  And, uh, I just, you talk about retaliation and whatnot. 
[01:18:00]  I just want people out there to remember there's no second guessing the military.  And President Bush, you know, because people will.  When he, when he does what he has to do, people will second guess him.  No, like, like everyone is saying, and I believe, uh, we got to stand behind him.  And, and, uh, uh, as a nation, stand behind his decision and, and, uh, Congress's decision.  But I, I just would like to see a little more human emotion and anger out of some of these politicians.  You know, the way we're all feeling. 
[01:18:30]  I know they feel the same way.  I, I don't want, I don't want them blurting out speeches that they hope make the history books in 50 years.  You're right.  You know, I, I want, I, I want real emotion.  Some of the other world leaders are giving really, you know, moving sentiments on TV.  Right, right.  You watch any BBC, Tony Blair talking about how this wasn't an American problem.  Haven't they always been great with those speeches?  Yeah.  It really moved you, you know.  Right from Winston Churchill.  You know, those were speeches. 
[01:19:00]  Right.  You know, and, and, and when, when it seems like they're trying a little too hard to make the history books, it kind of upsets me.  I, I would rather just have basic human emotion in this situation.  And, and let us know how you feel and what we're going to do about it.  And not in some, uh, a pseudo eloquent way.  You know, in plain English, let us know that, uh, in due time we will kick some major ass because of this.  No, you guys are right.  You're 100% right about that.  But my, my worry is that in a couple of years, three, four years, people forget. 
[01:19:30]  And then they, when they, when the military does their thing and they, every once in a while, you always get the people second guessing them.  Oh, maybe they got carried away.  That isn't right.  Well, we have to protect our country.  That's number one.  We could argue about little things all we want amongst each other.  Yeah.  But we have to keep our, our country safe.  And what I saw yesterday, I mean, it's, it's insane that, uh, that this went on and we can't ever, ever let it happen again.  We, we never thought anything like this would happen.  And it did.  And you know something? 
[01:20:00]  You can sit around and think maybe stuff like biological warfare will never happen.  We never thought that way.  You know, oh, I hear about it.  But that's that science fiction stuff.  You know, that only happens in movies and books and stuff.  But you know something?  If we don't deal with this now hard, that is a possibility.  That we're going to have to deal with.  And, and to tell you the truth, I sure don't want to deal with, uh, the likes of, of stuff like that.  No.  Because that's, that's a lot worse than what we even saw yesterday.  I didn't want to, I didn't want to get into that.  Because, uh, a lot of people, like, the fire the bomb, they train on that all the time. 
[01:20:30]  And what can really be done, I don't think the average person really has any idea what could really happen.  Well, again, we like to think that things are in place to protect us from stuff like that.  But the truth of the matter is, we're very vulnerable.  And, and we have to respond to this in a way that will really, uh, make these countries think twice about helping these people out.  But, you're 100% right.  And we will respond, I know that.  And we have to get harder and tighter with our security in this country. 
[01:21:00]  Right.  Without worrying about pissing special interest groups off.  They don't matter.  And, and, and, uh, uh, ethnic groups.  We have to understand, if, if, uh, Arab people are carrying out terrorist acts like this, we cannot be afraid to offend Arab groups when we give them a little more scrutiny when they're learning how to fly airplanes in Florida.  And when they're coming across the country's borders, uh, from Canada and whatnot, we can't worry about an Arab group getting pissed off that, uh, we're, we're holding them under a closer magnifying glass. 
[01:21:30]  You're 100% right.  It's our asses, man.  Of course.  Like I said, you have to protect our country first.  And don't be, you know, when you're in convenience at the airport four or five years from now, don't complain.  Right.  I mean, it's unbelievable.  I mean, people have short memories.  That's the, I think that's one of the problems.  And I'm not worried about now, because I know President Bush is going to do the right thing.  I have, I have, I have confidence in him.  I have no doubt about it.  But I'm worried about four or five years from now when people start to forget.  And these young, these young kids growing up and, ah, we got out of here. 
[01:22:00]  You don't have to worry about that.  They really have no idea what's going on.  And, uh, and then something like you let your guard down because, uh, the military's under scrutiny or they're downsizing the military.  And then something like this happens again.  Yeah.  How many, you know, there's, there's AWACS.  And, uh, fighter planes above, uh, a lot of major cities today.  And, uh, why, why shouldn't that be regular operations?  Right.  Why shouldn't that be standard operating procedure in this day and age when, when we're not flying, uh, all those, uh, all those aircraft over, uh, monitoring the Soviet Union anymore? 
[01:22:30]  Why can't we use that to protect our own asses?  That's right.  How come this isn't going on?  How come in the past eight years so many military bases have closed and that money has gone on to social programs?  When, uh, we can't even protect our own asses.  The money goes to save a bird somewhere.  Yeah.  Or it's great.  Is that a joke?  I mean, it's a joke.  I mean, I think this is a big reality check.  And I just don't think, I'll never forget it. 
[01:23:00]  I hope no one else ever forgets it.  It's a little inconvenience.  So what, you know, so what the military stops you?  You know, if I, if, if I was, uh, from an Arab country and I was an American, I wouldn't care.  I would understand.  Search me.  Go ahead.  I mean, how can anyone object to that?  Anyone that, you know, anyone, anyone that's a decent person wouldn't object to that.  We can't bow under.  It's too many politicians worrying about what these, uh, special interest groups and, and,  uh, ethnic groups that, that get together.  Uh, they worry too much about what they're going to say. 
[01:23:30]  If you have, if you, if you're not doing anything, you won't have a problem.  Don't worry about it.  But we have to start watching our own asses here.  Oh, but it, it, you know, they're doing it right under our nose in Boston.  It's unbelievable.  It's unbelievable.  It really is unbelievable.  But I hope, like I said, and, uh, I just, uh, I think, uh, Bush will do a great job.  And I know Giuliani's doing a great job and all, all the, all the brothers out there, you know,  that I tell you, just let me say this. 
[01:24:00]  There's a lot of brave men that work for the city.  You know, what I saw yesterday.  Yeah.  I mean, I've been a farmer for six years, but, you know, I, I always knew it and I've  been in situations with guys and I, I've, I always get impressed.  But yesterday I was, you know, even more impressed.  The bravery that these guys show, they're really, they're really heroes.  Every one of them.  Yeah.  And the, the cops too.  And, uh, everyone else, they, even there was some civilians down there that were putting  themselves in harm's way.  I mean, volunteers.  And it was really, it was really a side.  I was really amazed the bravery that people showed. 
[01:24:30]  All right, John.  All right.  Thank you for sharing today.  All right.  Thank you guys.  All right, man.  Bye-bye.  Yeah.  There's, there's just nothing you could say about, uh, the, uh, emergency workers,  police, fire department.  It's not, you can't put it into words.  These are people that have done things, uh, over the past couple of days that, that you  wouldn't even dream of doing.  And, uh, I'd be under my bed cowering, uh, and, and these people are just putting themselves  right in the line of danger.  And it's, it's amazing. 
[01:25:00]  Some of the people have just, uh, you know, the workers down there just sick because there's  nothing they can do with it.  And you can just see the frustration on their face.  They want to do something so bad and there's nothing they can do.  Yeah.  We're just waiting for the next hopeful, hopefully, uh, you know, a victim, uh, uh, you know,  I mean, a survivor to, to be pulled from, uh, the rubble, just sitting around hoping.  We just came back from a few of the different volunteer checkpoints and blood checkpoints  and we're just packed with people.  You can, you know, turning people away right now saying, come back to me this morning.  Yeah, they've got enough. 
[01:25:30]  Unbelievable.  Let's go to Lisa from PA.  Lisa.  Hi.  Hey, Lisa.  How are you guys doing?  Good.  Um, I know this is a far cry from what has happened the past day, but my brother was on  the U.S. as coal.  No, you know something?  It is another terrorist, uh, attack.  It's, it's not any more or less important.  Believe me.  The media and especially, um, the president actually gave almost the exact same speech  as they did last night, um, on, you know, oh, we're going to, you know, make no, we're 
[01:26:00]  going to get these people, we're going to get them, you know, and, and.  Bring them to justice.  Yeah.  And they forgot that short term memory that you guys have been talking about.  God, see, this is, we're going to bring them to justice.  The, the, the USS coal was, was hit by a raft full of explosives, pretty much, is what  it amounted to, a small boat.  They were tied up in Yemen, which is a hostile country.  Uh, we, we've used their ports before to get fuel and whatnot. 
[01:26:30]  God only knows why.  But, uh, for some reason, it's a hostile port.  It, it, it is known to, uh, harbor terrorists.  And for some reason, for some political reasons, we were not allowed to have our guys on the  guns on the deck of that ship in a hostile port because we didn't want to, we, we, we,  Or surrounding the port.  Right.  There was no security.  Because we didn't want to upset the government by having our ship armed in their port.  Well, F you. 
[01:27:00]  Exactly.  Because, uh, you guys were mentioning about, you know, we need to get a little more pissed.  Right.  I've been pissed, and I know this is, like I said, a far cry, but my family, and, and  we've all been pissed, and we just.  Hey, uh, Lisa, what happened to your brother?  Um, physically, now?  Yeah.  Um, he wasn't, he wasn't hurt, but he was, um, 18 minutes from the blast.  He was in main one 18 minutes prior to the blast.  He left main one and left his friend to take his shift for him, his best friend. 
[01:27:30]  Right.  And, um, Mark Nieto, um, was killed.  Shh.  Um, my brother has a lot of mental issues.  Um, he's scared.  He's very scared.  And what did we do to respond to that?  Nothing.  What did we do?  Nothing!  Why?  I mean, this is what I'm saying.  I just found out some information on this the other day.  Um, Yemeni's officials have arrested and, um, imprisoned six men for this.  They say we're responsible and are planning to execute them. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, yeah?  Whatever time.  And, you know, nobody, nobody's heard anything.  Nobody gives us any information.  And we have to find this thing, this information on our own.  The media forgot about this very soon after all this went down.  The only people that covered it were, like, far-right extreme Internet sites.  How about we don't, uh, we don't worry about stepping on people's toes.  And, and when our ships are, uh, are in hostile waters, we're allowed to defend ourselves with more than, 
[01:28:30]  I heard all the, uh, security that ship had was a couple of guys on deck with sidearms that had to remain unloaded.  Yep.  And that's all the, with a clip.  They had a clip in one pocket and their sidearm in their holster.  And that's the only defense that ship had because we were afraid of pissing off the people of Yemen.  Well, screw you.  I, I, I'm sick of us having to tiptoe around the world.  It's time we step on toes and we tell the people if they're pissed off, screw you. 
[01:29:00]  This is our asses we're trying to save.  This is what Roosevelt said.  Walk softly to carry a big freaking stick.  A big effing stick.  Right.  Right.  Shout out my people for you.  Thank you guys.  You guys are awesome.  All right, thanks.  Thanks.  Bye.  See, we forgot about the coal.  All of a sudden that was nothing.  And, and like she said, the same speech.  Come on, let's do something.  Bob, what's up?  What's going on, man?  We're in Boston.  What's up, Bob? 
[01:29:30]  I'm up in the Boston area.  Yeah.  I just got to give you guys a big shout out for covering this thing.  You're covering it better than any of the local stations up here.  Unfortunately, we're, uh, we're right in the middle of it.  Yeah, it's as, it's as real as it gets, uh, Bob, because, uh, three miles to my right is just one of the,  biggest disasters you'll ever, ever see.  Absolutely.  You know, but we just appreciate it, you know, because there's a big cloud of responsibility hanging over this area because it all started out of Boston.  Uh, we just, uh, we all appreciate you guys, you know, staying on the air all day yesterday like you did, you know, keeping us up to date. 
[01:30:00]  Well, selfish reasons, it keeps our mind, uh, off of it, even though we're talking about it, it, it, and, and it, it, it gives us a place to all vent, you know what I mean?  Absolutely.  Not just us, but, but a lot of the people, they, they, they really need to just yell and be pissed off about this to more than just, uh, friends or coworkers.  And this is, you know, this is, uh, your forum, too.  Yeah, I mean, my, my whole, I don't know how you guys felt about the, uh, the speeches with the president, but.  I thought it was pretty lame. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, I wanted him to, you know.  Not enough.  I, I just needed more.  I just needed more personally.  Yeah.  And I think I speak for everyone, obviously.  You, you, you, you, you want to, you want someone with emotion that's going to speak from the heart and not worry about, you know, what's on the cue cards or worry about, uh, you know, how his speech is going to be perceived that the speechwriters wrote for him, you know?  It looked like Carson Bailey, uh, enjoying a video for Christ's sake.  Yeah, he's sitting watching was like a machiner, man.  I wanted him to get on there and say, all right, you want the attention of a world power?  You want to see what we can do?  Here you go, God damn it. 
[01:31:00]  Right.  Something.  That's what I want to hear.  I mean, I want to hear something.  I don't want to hear, you know, you guys are going to get someday, you know, look, look, look in the camera, put your finger in there, look, be pissed off and, and, and let them know, uh, in your own words and, and with your own emotions,  how you feel and what you're going to do to respond to this, you know, without specifics, obviously, I'm not stupid, but, but just really, uh, be, be, be honest and pissed about it. 
[01:31:30]  Right.  Not a speechwriter's words.  Well, I just want to, I wanted to just tell you guys that we really appreciate everything you're doing, uh, and just say a prayer for everyone that's, uh, being affected by this tragedy.  All right, Bob.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  I'm from Boston.  Put more people there than Logan, you bastards.  Jesus.  Someone's head's going to roll over there, I bet you.  You know, they're, they're saying at Logan that, uh, that, uh, there, there was no security laughs.  There was nothing, and, you know, yeah, it might be hard to, uh, to, to figure that stuff out, uh, how they were getting the knives on, on the planes and whatnot. 
[01:32:00]  But, you know, you got a couple planes come out of there that did a lot of damage, and somebody's, uh, somebody's heads are going to roll up there.  Mark my words.  Your brother-in-law's on the line.  Johnny Race.  Johnny Race.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  What's happening, man?  Usually we talk about KISS with Johnny Race.  Yeah.  A little different, man.  I just wanted to get my two cents in, um, my brother, Don Race, he's in the emergency service, he's in a truck nine out of Queens.  Right.  And, uh, he went in, uh, yesterday in the afternoon, but he was, uh, bringing the doctors to, like, Chase Stadium and whatnot. 
[01:32:30]  And then, uh, he was in there about eight o'clock last night, and he worked all the way through the night, and, uh, and he's one of the few guys that helped pull out the, uh, the Port Authority, uh, police.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And, uh, Kevin Miller, the bartender of Wickers, he, uh, he's a steel worker during the day.  He was there with his whole crew, and the guy was just, you know, just calling on the phone, calling his, uh, best friends, you know, pulling out dead bodies.  Yeah, they've just seen some horrible stuff, huh?  You know, it's just, uh, hey, we, you know, it's a shame that we all got to pull together for something like this. 
[01:33:00]  We should be like this all the time.  Yeah, yeah, well, you know, you're right.  It's, it's unfortunate that it takes stuff like this to keep us from yelling at people in the crosswalk when that light turns green in front of me.  And, you know, I, I was being a little nicer, although there wasn't that much traffic or anything, but normally if somebody tries to, uh, cross that street when the light's green, I'm on that horn.  You know, I got the window down, I'm screaming, you mother effer.  But, uh, you know, today, yesterday, it just didn't seem all that important, and I, I can only hope for the time where I can get pissed off at stuff like that again. 
[01:33:30]  Hey, man, you know, the hominies, it's just stay with us all the time, man.  We gotta look out for our own, that's it.  You got it right.  All right, man, rock and roll.  All right, Johnny.  You're doing a great job, guys.  All right, Johnny.  Thanks, John.  Be good.  Rock and roll, Johnny Race.  When can we get back to the days where Johnny Race is at the Vanderbilt, uh, watching his friend get tinkled upon by a chick?  When can we get back to normal?  I think, uh, our listeners will let us know that.  Yes, they will.  Yeah.  Kelly, what's, uh, it's funny you mention that, because, uh, radio stations in New York already playing music, and. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, well, they had their one day of, uh.  Trying to come up with, uh, cute songs to play, and.  It's kind of, you know, maybe you just run out of things to say, maybe that's it.  Maybe, uh, I don't think it's a, uh, a huge decision to then just throw music on.  I'm pissed off at someone that we work, uh, someone in our own company.  Yeah.  Had the nerve to ask Ken Stevens, our general manager, when all this went down yesterday.  So, uh, what are, what are Opie and Anthony going to do on their show today? 
[01:34:30]  What do you think?  And the paper's the same thing.  They're all surprised, because we're, we, uh, blew off our regular show.  To, uh, you know, go with this.  Just completely surprised.  Oh, yeah, we're going to do, uh, best day for day and all that fun stuff.  Yesterday and today, of course.  Yeah, well, I guess the thing, well, you, you can't totally fault them.  I mean, when they tune in on a daily basis, it is, uh, usually, usually a little out of control.  But, what we always say is, it's just honesty, and it's, it's who we are. 
[01:35:00]  And when we're having fun, we're having a lot of fun.  And then, uh, we're not having fun, and we're joined together with a bunch of people that are, that are in turmoil right now.  So, we're going to, we're going to sit down and talk about that.  And that's what we do.  It doesn't always have to be a joke.  And, uh, this, this is just how we're feeling.  And, and we're, we're sharing, uh, the time with, uh, other people that have been through this.  And, and listening to how they're feeling.  This show has always been about just going with the flow.  Right.  You know?  Yep.  We're going with the flow.  Kelly, what's up? 
[01:35:30]  Hey, uh, hi, guys.  Hey.  Uh, I just want to tell you, I love your show.  And, um, I have to tell you, uh, my uncle was in one of the trade centers yesterday.  Yeah.  Um, he was on the 37th floor.  Uh, luckily he got out.  We didn't find out until 9 o'clock.  No one knew if he was dead or alive.  Yeah, a lot of people really just didn't know for, for quite a while.  Yeah, um, he says that, uh, that, I don't know, it was in the first or second tower.  But, um, he said that, uh, he felt the building shake, like, you know, like an earthquake. 
[01:36:00]  Mm-hmm.  And they all, um, they all ran to the, uh, the elevators and they couldn't get in because  it was smoke filled.  So they had to walk down the stairs and get out.  And everybody was telling him to run.  And he almost orphaned, I guess, uh, two children yesterday because his wife died of cancer two  months ago.  Oh, man.  Oof.  Yeah, they're, uh, 19 and 14.  It's a tough old world, man.  All right, Kelly.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Trying to get as many people on as possible today because everyone just needs to vent. 
[01:36:30]  Uh, Chris, what's up?  Hey, man.  What's going on, O.A.?  Hey.  You guys are, are handling this thing awesome.  Yeah.  Wow.  I'm an EM.  We don't know what else to do.  You know?  Yeah, you guys are handling it like two pros.  Thanks, man.  But, uh, I was down, I'm an EMT.  Yeah.  And I was down with everything I have yesterday.  Psycho Mark was down there.  Psycho Mark, uh, for a lot of the cities that don't know, you know, a friend of the show  has done a lot of great stuff for our show.  He was like a champ down there.  It's good to see somebody like him out. 
[01:37:00]  He works for Fox.  Yeah.  Here's another guy, though, that is known for being an effing lunatic.  We've, uh, had this guy on the air for quite a while.  Uh, uh, he got, uh, fired from our, our show for various sexual, uh, you can say it.  For various.  Yes.  He, he was there when a couple had anal on the boss's couch.  On the boss's couch in the office.  And he was told not to do it.  And, and he, he, he pretty much said F you to our, uh, another boss and had the couple  do it.  But yeah, he, he got fired. 
[01:37:30]  But everyone knows him as just being a psychopath.  He goes out, uh, to appearances and he's always screaming and yelling and saying the wrong  stuff.  He's just a nut.  Well, here he is yesterday on Fox News, the on the spot reporter.  Uh, you, you would think he was Stone Phillips or something.  Everyone was interviewing him because he was, I mean, Ben could tell the stories.  I'll, we'll get Ben on in a second.  And I have to say it again.  I said it yesterday.  I'm looking at, uh, people interview Psycho Mark because he, he was an eyewitness to this 
[01:38:00]  whole damn thing because his, where he lives is right there.  It overlooks his window, overlooks the center.  And as a matter of fact, Fox News used his apartment as their, uh, camera vantage point.  They had a camera in his apartment, out his window.  So when he heard that first explosion, went to the window, he watched and watched and  saw everything else that happened.  That's how close he is.  Uh, and, and I'm, I'm watching him on TV last night or yesterday and it just didn't look  like him.  Like, is that Psycho Mark?  I had to look like two or three times.  Holy S, it's Psycho Mark as serious could be. 
[01:38:30]  His whole face was different.  He didn't have a smirk.  Did you talk to your doctor about Stanker too, boys?  Yeah, he didn't have a smirk.  His, you know, he was as serious as I've ever seen anyone in my life.  Yeah, you just expect him to go, grab the 50 cow, get those redheads, gah, gah, gah, gah.  Yeah, the guy's, you know, yeah.  The guy's all about goofing and just being an idiot.  But he was, uh, uh, the consummate professional.  Uh, Ben, who knows Psycho Mark really well, you should tell some of the stories that, uh,  seriously, Psycho Mark, I think he's going to call the show because he was right there. 
[01:39:00]  He was.  He was doing such a good job.  I mean, just...  What was he doing, Chris?  He was just, you know, the fact that he was, well, keeping, he was so calm, so composed,  trying to, you know, even when people were, like, taking off.  And one thing we, we have learned about Psycho Mark on this show, in a different context,  of course, is that he does a good job of describing what, what's going on.  You know, he does a great job of, of looking at something and, and then, uh, being able  to translate it, uh, to people that might not be able to see it, uh, and, uh, uh, translate 
[01:39:30]  what had happened prior.  Uh, he's very good at that.  He is.  And he's an effing lunatic.  And I don't care what I saw on the news yesterday, he's still a nutcase.  It was, like, people were, like, running by, and they're, like, wait a minute, that's  Psycho Mark.  Yeah.  Wait.  Yeah.  Hold on for a second.  Hey!  I think a lot of people were, like, oh, my God, they got Psycho Mark, what's he going  to do?  You know, hold up a wow or something?  No.  You know?  No, he was a professional.  Because when I was, when I was seeing him on TV, I'm praying.  I know.  Don't say, Mark, we do not need the publicity. 
[01:40:00]  You trust me.  Just, just do not do it.  And, obviously, he didn't.  But, uh, Ben said while we were having coffee today that, uh, you know, uh, whatever.  You should sit, you should sit, tell some of this stuff.  I don't know what you want to say on the air.  Well, and he just, Mark, Mark is, you know, he's a nut, but he's a professional.  He woke up yesterday.  He's got a perfect view of the, the Trade Center.  And he looks up, he heard the crash, and he watched the entire thing from his windows.  Watched people just jumping like crazy.  He said easily 150 people.  He saw a couple just holding each other that were jumping out the windows. 
[01:40:30]  He said another guy was up at the top, and he had, like, a flag or a white, a towel or something.  He was trying to get out, and then all of a sudden, you see this, uh, you see this, uh, big explosion.  Big explosion.  The dude just, he said he just went flying way out.  Oh, man.  And Mark, you know, Mark watched the whole thing.  And the problem with Mark is we know he's an idiot, and for his family and stuff, no one could get a hold of him.  We figured he probably went running down there.  Ooh, I'll get a picture, you know.  I'm going inside. 
[01:41:00]  I'll go inside.  I'll die this way.  And I'll get a hold of him.  But he told me that, you know, he's picked up stuff.  He's picked up checks on the ground.  He's picked up pictures of little kids.  And I'm looking forward to picking up chicks because now I'm respectable.  I could get a whole new class of chicks.  He told me, he goes, he said that there was a Suburban down there that was crashed up like a Matchbox toy car.  He said it was the craziest thing he's ever seen.  But, yeah, you know, it's not even Mark, you know, being the idiot that he is and he doesn't tell his family or anything, we're all leaving messages for him. 
[01:41:30]  He finally changes his voicemail message, and it's a totally different sounding Mark going, I'm okay, I'm fine.  It's not the crazy, wow, let's go crazy, Mark.  It's the very calm Mark.  So he's, yeah, he's, you know, he's freaked, you know, he's a little freaked, but he saw the whole thing from his 43rd floor apartment.  And Fox News right there in his apartment.  Yeah, right there, and you know, it's funny, I'm watching Fox this morning, and there's a shot from yesterday, and it's completely Mark's apartment, right? 
[01:42:00]  And, you know, Mark also, you know, his windows, he's up on the 43rd floor, he's not, they're not supposed to open, but of course, Mark, you know, broke the thing, so they opened.  So they had the camera right out of his window, and, you know, an unbelievable shot.  All right.  Hey, thank you, Chris.  Hey, no comments, but you guys should know.  All right, we've got to go to Psycho Mark's brother, Tim, who's up in Boston, I believe.  Tim, what's up?  What's going on?  Hey.  Yeah, we did have, the family was biting our fingernails, obviously, because he didn't think to call in to his family. 
[01:42:30]  When I see his building, it's getting, it's floating around on him.  You know, you can see his actual building from the cameras.  Wow.  When it's crashing.  And he doesn't call anything?  Well, that's just a typical Psycho Mark.  I am going to give him a beat when I see him the next time, because, you know, my mother was, like, balling her eyes, and my mother's actually in Paris right now.  She's balling her eyes, and I'm calling down there.  I mean, oh, but you said you saw him on TV.  He called Ben.  Ben called me.  His boss had finally called me, but it was, like, he didn't talk to him until about three, but that's a typical, obviously. 
[01:43:00]  But, yeah, he told me, I was like, so what happened?  He was like, yeah, I was, like, getting dressed, and there was a big explosion.  He goes, you look right out his window, and you feel like you can touch the Twin Towers.  He just said that it was just, you know, the debris and people falling out the window and people jumping, holding hands, jumping, stuff like that.  So that's pretty tough for anybody to see, I would assume.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He said there was a couple jumping out the window, and he just said it was just carnage and just craziness, mayhem, you know? 
[01:43:30]  I talked to him last night, and I talked to him again this morning, and he just said, you know, you can tell that it's just a lot.  He's had an hour's sleep, and it's not a lot to take in, to be sure, you know?  I mean, like, you know, I was just going to keep the coffee.  Those guys are kind of, like, not trained to deal with this, but, you know, they're in that profession.  But, you know, you've got my brother who's on the weed, you know, having a good time, and he sees people jumping out windows. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, that's going to take a little harder, I think.  All right.  Hey, thank you, Tim.  Yep.  This is starting to suck again.  Pedro.  Yeah, what's up, Pedro?  I'm just exhausted, guys.  Just really tired.  You've been on the scene?  Yeah.  It's just nothing.  I'm just going to say, guys, Koi did not match this.  Yeah.  You were over there, huh? 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  Now, you're an EMT.  What have you done?  What have you seen?  I'm an EMT.  I'm a military police officer.  Oh.  We were setting up our checkpoints and helping with moving rubble and debris and trying to see what we could find.  Had to bring down some working dogs, trying to find some people, but there's just not a whole lot you can do.  Yeah, that's what they've said.  It's like they haven't found many survivors, you know?  It's just really hard, you know?  You've got dust, concrete dust and insulation that's about six inches taken from Exodus, and you've got rubble that's five stories tall. 
[01:45:00]  It's just so hard to look at.  Yeah.  I don't know how the hell they're going to clear that out.  It's just a massive undertaking.  You see these huge bulldozers down there trying to clear it out, and the bucket load is just a drop in the bucket to the amount of rubble that's down there.  And you know they're not going to just be able to rush in there and clear it out because they've got to recover either bodies or hopefully survivors. 
[01:45:30]  But it's just going to take quite a while to clean that up.  Yeah, right now the Army Corps of Engineers around, they're trying to show up what they can, the best they can to make it safe for people to get in there and work.  And it's just all about trying to get the situation as safe as possible for us to get in there and help clear it out.  Yeah.  Well, it's going to be some time before anybody's able to go to work down there in that area.  Yeah, it's just really hard, you know?  Looking at that skyline and missing those three buildings is just, it's really weird. 
[01:46:00]  It's just a little hard to look at.  Whoever's sending the links to, like, pictures of, you know, body parts, no thank you.  I'm not opening any more links today.  Oh, you opened the link?  Don't need to see what I just saw.  I'm sending a look at that today.  All right, Pedro, thank you.  Hey, sorry to bum you guys out.  Sorry to bum us out.  No, we're numb.  Thanks, Pedro.  Yeah, those bucks. 
[01:46:30]  All right.  Is that West Coast Dave sending that?  Dave, you've sent that?  Ass.  Don't send that.  That's that from run.com or something.  Well, you know what, to his defense, he didn't send that actual link.  I just happened to get in a different part of the site and clicked on something.  But he actually didn't send what Opie saw.  Well, I'm not even looking.  You don't want to.  Matt, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  It's really good to hear some frustration on the air. 
[01:47:00]  You know, it gets a little disheartening.  It's like you're getting nowhere when you listen to the politicians talk.  They're all jockeying for positions.  Not all.  I mean, you know.  You know, me and I mean, I'm not speaking for the population, but, you know, I really want to hear.  There's going to be blood flowing on some third world country gutters here real soon.  I mean, I support them just like we're supposed to.  But the thing is, I'm not feeling it.  You know what I mean?  I don't either.  I don't want to sit there in a phony way and say, yeah, and start waving the flag because  they tell me to or sit there and listen to these red speeches that a speechwriter wrote. 
[01:47:30]  I want some real feeling to come out and some real anger.  Well, so far, the only real feelings that I've heard so far come from this show.  Now, I have a friend of mine who was actually down in the area, and I hope there's no body  parts involved, but I have a bunch of about 16 pictures I'll send you guys.  It's some pretty intense things, but there's no gore involved, just the actual process of  the building being struck, and it's all photos that were taken amateur.  You know, I have seen enough pictures. 
[01:48:00]  I've seen it all.  I'm burnt out on looking at video clips and pictures.  I want to turn the TV on and watch the Flintstones.  You can find it.  I know.  I'm so done with watching any more clips and videos and pictures.  It's just awful.  Well, we're going to liven things up.  I'm going to cut you off because we might have info on that flight from Rome.  So there was a lady that called earlier.  I think her name was Lisa, trying to figure out what hotel her parents are in in Rome. 
[01:48:30]  Hello?  Lisa.  Hello.  Hi, how are you?  Are you legit or what?  Because this is not a day to go.  Actually, I'm legit.  Yeah, my parents are on the same flight.  I have the hotel and the phone number.  Is this other girl Lisa?  This is another girl named Lisa, whose parents are on the same flight.  Okay, and you're positive about that?  I'm positive.  I have the hotel.  I have...  What happened was they were supposed to go to Canada, and they re-rooted the flight back  to Rome.  Right.  And the flight didn't land until like 11 o'clock Rome time, which was like 7 o'clock 
[01:49:00]  Pennsylvania time yesterday.  Okay, so what do you got?  Because, you know, it's going to be almost impossible for that other Lisa to get through,  so you might as well put the info in the air.  Okay, the actual address, I mean the actual phone number to the hotel.  Just give the hotel.  The hotel?  Yeah.  What hotel is they in our room?  I don't know how to say it.  Spell it.  R-G-I-S-E.  R-G.  E-R-E.  E-R-E.  E-R-G.  Start over. 
[01:49:30]  I-S-E.  Hold on, hold on.  Start over.  Start over.  Lisa, start over.  Seriously.  Okay, do you want the phone number to the hotel?  Well, start over with the name of the hotel.  Do it slowly.  One letter at a time.  E is in Eric.  E is in Eric.  All right.  Robert.  We are...  G is in Jeffrey.  G.  I.  I.  Is it Frank?  F.  E is in Eric.  E.  All right.  And it's in Rome. 
[01:50:00]  It's in Rome.  Wow, that's wacky.  Okay.  In Rome.  In Rome.  Okay, and we...  Are we allowed to give out the phone number?  I mean, this is...  Yeah, we can give out the phone number.  Okay, and people, you know, it would be really stupid.  Let's give up the talk to the guy there.  It would be real stupid to call Rome as a goof.  So, just if this girl Lisa, the other Lisa is listening, here's the number.  Try giving it a call.  And people, let her make the call.  Don't tie up the number with your shenanigans.  All right, go ahead.  Okay, it's the international number. 
[01:50:30]  011...  011...  39...  39...  06...  06...  66...  66...  440...  440.  Okay.  And that'll put them directly into the hotel.  Right on.  All right, and if Lisa didn't get that, if she could keep trying to call, we'll have that  info here for her if she finally does get through.  All right, perfect.  Somebody just called me and told me that they thought I was on the air.  Okay.  Actually, it was somebody else named Lisa.  Yeah.  Thank you, Lisa.  You're welcome. 
[01:51:00]  Thank you.  All right, man.  Let's go to Joe...  Oh, where did I go?  Shoot.  You went nowhere.  All right, hold on, hold on.  Let's go to Joe in Boston.  Hello?  Hey, Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I've been like...  Oh, man, this is crazy stuff.  I lived about 20 minutes off the bridge.  I used to live in Jersey.  Okay.  All right, well, I do still live in Jersey.  I'm a college student, right?  Now I go to Boston College, right?  I had a choice of going either to NYU or to BC.  Like, right at the end, I was like, you know what?  I love Boston.  I got to come up here because I just love this place. 
[01:51:30]  Now, like, NYU is what?  A couple blocks away from the World Trade Center?  Hey, Joe.  Yeah.  Let's get to the point.  Why is that complicated?  All right.  Yeah, no, the thing is, man, it's like, I'm in Boston, and I live 20 minutes away from  where this hotel is, where this hotel, where the FBI agents keep going in.  Over the past couple nights, I've been here, over the last night...  Joe, you have nothing.  No, man.  Hold on.  No, there's been bombs.  You're 20 minutes away from something that's going on in Boston.  There are people right outside the Western Hotel. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, I know.  So what do you have today?  Dude, man, it's just crazy with all this bomb stuff.  We understand it's crazy, man.  I'm hearing, like, fire trucks and police going out all crazy over here, man.  Crazy?  It's insane, man.  Maybe you'll...  All right, man.  Thank you, Joe.  Thank you, Joe.  Thank you, Joe.  There you go.  We got a quick clip of Colin Powell.  We have to still try to return life to a sense of jealousy.  We cannot be a people who are afraid to live.  We cannot be a people who will move away from a relatively open society. 
[01:52:30]  We cannot be a people who walk around terrified.  We're Americans.  We don't walk around terrified.  I don't know.  I kind of get terrified.  I'm looking around.  Yeah, I'm looking around.  It's kind of terrifying.  Here's another clip from Colin.  Hearts go out to all the victims and to their families.  It is a tragedy.  But as the president has made clear, it is a tragedy that we are strong enough to overcome.  Our spirits will not be broken.  The resilience of this society will not be broken.  And we will find out who is responsible for this. 
[01:53:00]  And we will pay for it.  Okay.  I like that.  But, you know, it's the resilient part.  You know, we know we're resilient.  We know that life will go on.  And the city will get back to some normalcy.  I want to hear about the ass-kicking part.  Let's hear from Newt.  When you go to war, you have a whole new set of rules.  You can blockade.  You can use force.  And you communicate to other governments, such as Sudan and Afghanistan, that the United States is now serious. 
[01:53:30]  That killing our men, women, and children, killing people in our cities will never be accepted.  And you're either with us against the terrorists or you're with the terrorists against us.  But there will be no neutrals.  All right.  Okay, Newt.  At least he's talking about the issue of the terrorists.  I don't want to hear about how resilient we are.  We know.  More people died yesterday.  More civilians died yesterday than on any day in American history. 
[01:54:00]  It is clear that forces have declared war against the United States.  What is not yet clear is whether we're prepared to step up to that, declare war, and use the elements of war, the military, the intelligence community,  or whether we're going to try to deal with this as a criminal justice problem.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Let me tell you something.  If bin Laden sent his men over here, right, and they walked into a deli and stole the back chips, that's a criminal justice problem. 
[01:54:30]  You know, they stole something.  This is not a criminal justice problem.  This does not see courtrooms.  This sees the nose cones of bombs.  This is a war.  Right.  Different rules.  This was a systematic act of war, and it is very, very important that we move in the direction of making this a matter of war,  a matter of national security policy, not a criminal justice system matter.  And I think that in that sense, my hope is that this morning the president will be indicating that he will be coming to the Congress soon 
[01:55:00]  and that he'll be asking the Congress for a declaration of war.  Very good.  How many years did we have to sit and wait while the Pan Am Lockerbie debacle sat with the suspected bombers trying to be extradited?  Ooh, watch out, he's sending over a subpoena. 
[01:55:30]  You know, that's crap, and I really don't want to sit through more of that.  You would declare war against the terrorist organizations and any governments which support, sustain, or protect those terrorist organizations.  Yep.  That's it.  You can hear the emotion in his voice.  I like this.  You got a country that backs these people, supports them?  Gone.  The declaration would be against bin Laden and any terrorist who supported him, 
[01:56:00]  and the declaration would be against any state which harbored or protected bin Laden  after the United States demanded that they were turned over.  I think that clearly Afghanistan is a potential target, Sudan is a potential target.  I don't know beyond that.  Iraq.  But it's increasingly clear, as you just reported, that we are going to be able to track down the evidence of who was involved.  Yeah.  Well, absolutely.  It doesn't, you know, you talk about, oh, we got to find out who's responsible.  We know who's responsible for acts of terrorism. 
[01:56:30]  Maybe, is it this act of terrorism?  Probably.  But if it's not, it doesn't matter.  It's time, like I said yesterday, Michael Corleone, the end of the Godfather, remember that?  Time to take care of all the family business.  Time to pay back for the embassy bombings, the barracks bombings.  Time to take care of the coal bombing and this bombing.  Time to tie up all the loose ends.  All the stuff we neglected to do for the past few years. 
[01:57:00]  Now's the time.  So it doesn't matter if they're responsible for this act.  They did other stuff.  So anyone that harbored bin Laden, any other terrorists that have done things like this,  held responsible and will be dealt with.  All right, let's go to Donna.  Donna, what's up?  Hey, hi, guys.  Calling from PA.  What's up?  Yeah, I just wanted to say how easily it is to get box cutters on the airlines.  Because I've done it actually seven times. 
[01:57:30]  I mean, several times, like unintentionally.  Why are you bringing box cutters onto a plane?  Well, because...  Why do people have box cutters?  How many boxes do people open it up?  No, I did it unintentionally because I work for a company that when we go to a convention,  we actually ship the box cutters out in one case to open up all the other cartons that we have to display our product.  And after we're done with, you know, everybody has a box cutter. 
[01:58:00]  And I just sometimes throw it in my purse, you know, forget about it totally, and carry a big, pretty big purse when I travel.  Yeah.  And...  Did anyone ever look in your purse after going to the x-ray machine and...  No, no, never.  To go, well, what's that?  Maybe I should check it out.  Have you seen these people that stand in front of these effing x-ray machines?  Where the hell do they get their job?  I don't know what they're looking...  And again, it's the whole perception.  We like to believe that they are looking at that screen and they know what to look for. 
[01:58:30]  But you know something?  Most of them look like they just stepped out of those goddamn traffic uniforms, handed tickets out on the street,  and stepped in front of these friggin' x-ray machines.  Well, that's it.  I mean, I've done it unintentionally.  I didn't know it or I would have taken it out, but I put it in there.  I switched purses to a smaller purse when I'm going around at the convention.  Switched back over to Big Purse, forget all about this box cutter I had put in there.  See?  Get home.  Someone should be looking for this. 
[01:59:00]  I get home, I start to clean out my purse of all the stuff of travel when I look,  and there's a box cutter in there, and I'm like, oh, my God.  They don't know what the hell they're looking at.  They put things through the x-ray machine.  And you know another thing?  If you walk through that machine and it beeps, and you empty your pockets and put it in the little basket,  and walk through and it don't beep anywhere,  and then take the stuff out of the basket,  do you know what you could put inside a cell phone or other things that they just hand right back to you again? 
[01:59:30]  I know, I know.  It's ridiculous.  And my boss has even done it, and today our salespeople were in,  and they said, one of them said, you know,  I carry a box cutter all the time in my briefcase.  He said just, you know, because he's out on the road a lot, and, you know,  he said he's getting ready to fly back, and he said, I'm going to have to take it out now.  Perceived security.  It's scary how easy it was.  Yeah.  It just boggles the mind.  It's perceived security.  It stopped me just for a look at a hairbrush.  Right. 
[02:00:00]  And, I mean, even the one time we were down in New Orleans when Al Gore was there,  and I went through, I had a little pouch.  Had a box cutter in there.  Look at you with your box cutter.  Yeah, yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Enough with your box cutter.  Yeah, let's leave those at home for now on.  Okay, Donna?  A box cutter.  Well, I walk through.  They check my little pouch purse.  I get in there.  They just look in the top of it.  I get in there, you know, we're going to see Al Gore and everything.  You know, I think we're getting back to a little bit of normalcy, Opie.  This woman's annoying me for some reason. 
[02:00:30]  Why?  I don't know.  Just your voice.  My voice?  See, I'm getting, I'm feeling some normalcy again.  All right, Donna.  Thank you.  Okay.  All right.  It didn't take long.  Good.  Trying to control anything.  Oh, my God.  Her and her box cutter.  Enough about the box cutters.  Carrie, what's up?  Yeah, how you doing?  How are you?  First thing I want to say is I want to say that to speak to everyone in our hearts,  go out to the families, all the people that went.  But it's making me sick listening to what some of these people are talking about on the air.  All right?  First of all, the people are talking about going back to normalcy. 
[02:01:00]  There's never going to be normalcy to the people that are in their families.  We all know that.  All right?  Do you want to know that we can get back to normalcy is where we see the flash of light  in the mushroom cloud when we go over there and we bomb every one of those people  responsible?  That would be nice.  To me, every one of those people, those women and children that were chanting in the street  and cheering the death of all civilians, they just became soldiers.  Potential terrorists, future terrorists.  These are the same people that when there's a goddamn earthquake or a mudslide or their 
[02:01:30]  little stinky village crumbles to the ground, we're the first people to pack food and aid  and send it over, and the elementary school kids in our country, are they jumping for  joy?  No.  They write little letters and cards and send it over there.  And their little bastards stand there with their stupid flag and jump up for joy that  our people are dead.  These are those Hillary Clintons and the liberal groups of all societies that want to feel bad  for these people.  And you've got to stop feeling bad for them. 
[02:02:00]  I don't feel bad for them all.  I want every one of them eliminated.  I think they deserve it.  I think they're all terrorist sympathizers.  Right.  And I think every one of them harbor them.  They hide them out.  And as far as I'm concerned, that makes you, you're harboring a killer.  That's what these people are.  They're challenging killers.  Political correctness has no place in national security.  We can't be afraid to offend these people by weeding them out.  That's right.  You can't.  And all we've got to do now, they've declared war.  And every one of those people dancing in the street, the women and children, all they're  doing is raising their children to hate the United States. 
[02:02:30]  Exactly.  I mean, in 10, 15 years from now, these people are potential terrorists.  They're cultivating weapons is what they're doing.  They're not raising children.  And these people are calling in with their, my mom, he doesn't know where I am, and the  box cutters and stupid, ridiculous things like that.  It's making me sick to my stomach.  And you're in the New York Fire Department, right?  No, my brother's in the New York Fire Department.  They lost a lot of his house and lost a lot of people yesterday.  How many did they lose?  They lost seven altogether.  Jesus.  Out of like 14 people.  And there's no normalcy to their lives. 
[02:03:00]  Not today, not tomorrow, not today.  No?  And that's what the big thing is.  And all these people, there was not one military target hit yesterday in New York City.  These were civilians, and the people in Palestine and Afghanistan were cheering it, and it was  a disgusting sight.  Yeah.  And when I see a mushroom cloud and I see them people burning in the street, then maybe some  normalcy will be brought back to the society.  Yeah.  All right, Kevin.  All right.  All right.  Thank you for listening.  Bye-bye.  That's it.  Can't sit around and be all sensitive to, oh, wait, we can't offend this group, so why 
[02:03:30]  don't we sit here like sitting ducks?  No.  Dan, you're next on the OPN Info Show.  What's up?  Man, I was right there yesterday on that, and I was on a rooftop in New Jersey watching  the whole thing.  I am so pissed off right now.  I can't even tell you.  So see that, did you guys see Fox 5 yesterday with that fat woman with her tongue in the  middle of the street at the West Bank?  Oh, that blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, that teeth falling out of her head.  Just ridiculous. 
[02:04:00]  Celebrating, dancing in the streets.  Did you see the guy driving by in the little truck, and he's giving the victory sign and  waving, and he's got a little banner inside his truck that says Ford.  Like he's driving an American car, and he's cheering, and those little future terrorists,  those small weapons that they're raising are waving their flags, and I was completely disgusted, 
[02:04:30]  and I can think of nothing better than seeing them burn.  Just terrible.  Either to blow them all up or line them all up and give them the AIDS virus or something.  I don't know what to think.  Anyway, the second point is, I was watching Channel 7 yesterday.  I saw Joe Torres on Channel 7.  He's on the east side of the World Trade Center.  West side, whatever he was.  He was on the west or the east side.  He was on one of the sides, and he gets on the news report.  He says, luckily, the debris fell to the other side that he wasn't on.  He's like, thank goodness that it didn't fall to my side.  Gee, other people on the other side of you. 
[02:05:00]  And then someone told him his earpiece, you freaking douchebag, what did you just say?  He's like, oh, Joe Torres, ABC News, get me off the air, please, very quickly.  Yeah.  Just disgusting.  And anyway, guys, I wanted to commend you on yesterday.  It was nice to hear some familiar voices, and it really got me through the afternoon.  I appreciate it.  All right, Dan, thank you.  All right, man.  We're going to go to Radovich from CBS Sports.  He helped us out a lot yesterday, and he's back on today.  Pete, what's going on?  Hey, guys, last time I complimented you on the air, and you hung up on me.  So let me just say, I just thought you guys did a terrible job yesterday.  No, man, we didn't hang up on you on the air. 
[02:05:30]  I'm just kidding.  We didn't have the power to do that from where we were yesterday.  No, no, no, not yesterday.  Last time I talked to you from Billy.  But anyway, I'm just watching the news here, and WNBC just reported that there was a flight  yesterday morning at 9 o'clock from JFK to L.A.  There were three Muslim-looking men that were arguing with the flight attendants,  and the flight attendants asked them to leave the plane, and they would not leave the plane.  And the flight attendants argued with them.  They had to get off.  They were persistent that they couldn't get off the plane. 
[02:06:00]  Was this the guys that there was something wrong with their boarding pass?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they called the police.  Yeah.  As soon as the guys found out that the police were coming, they took off.  And it turns out, it looks like that flight 23, United flight 23 from JFK to L.A.  To L.A.  Was another flight.  Fifth plane.  Whoa.  They just reported it now.  It looks like it's unbelievable.  It looks like there was going to be a fifth plane. 
[02:06:30]  And those three guys are at large now.  And that fits the M.O., you know, the plane, the airline, the fuel in it to go to L.A.?  Right.  Right out of...  At 9 o'clock.  9 o'clock.  It's supposed to take off at 9 o'clock.  Wow.  Holy God.  Imagine the people on that plane.  So those bastards are out there.  So there are guys that are out there right now.  Still alive in our country.  They've got to be rounded up and destroyed.  Destroyed.  They should be strapped to the cruise missiles that we bomb their country with. 
[02:07:00]  It's incredible.  Yeah.  And, Anthony, I agree with you.  Last night, I was a Clinton guy.  And I know you were killing Clinton yesterday.  But, you know, I was a little nervous when Bush was elected.  But last night, you know, going into that speech, I heard everyone saying, this is the biggest presidential speech in decades.  And I said, you know what?  I'm with you 100%.  I'm with you.  Yeah.  This is it.  This is it.  Let's go.  And I'm telling you, about five minutes in, my mind started wandering.  He lost me. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  I lost interest.  I wanted a more emotional speech from this guy that was reflecting the people in this country and their anger a little better.  I mean, I wanted to be with him.  I was looking forward to hearing it.  I was on his team.  I'm still on his team.  But I agree with you.  He had the same demeanor as when he was giving that tax refund speech.  Exactly.  He lost me.  I literally called myself wandering. 
[02:08:00]  My mind wandering.  One of the most important speeches ever.  And you were wandering.  I've never seen him show emotion.  Anyway, during the inauguration, as he became president, he had no emotion.  If that's how he is, all right, that's fine.  Right.  But I don't think that's how he is.  I think he's trying too hard to make a historic speech than he is to just go off the cuff with a few things and really put some emotion in how you really feel into it. 
[02:08:30]  He was obviously reading, number one, which I thought was a problem, too.  That's what they do.  That's what they do.  But I thought this was the one time that it wouldn't have been a bad idea to just talk to us.  Roll your sleeves up.  Put your finger in the camera.  Look into it and just go, hey, whoever's responsible.  You're not getting away with this.  Just something that kind of showed like you're a man that's pissed and ready to kick some ass.  It's unbelievable.  The last thought I had was, you know, in the middle of the night, I woke up to go to the bathroom. 
[02:09:00]  And I was carrying it over there.  It's like 3 o'clock in the morning.  You don't have your wits.  And I started thinking, like, oh, wow, they bombed the World Trade Center.  And then it, like, hit me.  Like a ton of brakes.  Oh, my God, the World Trade Center disappeared.  It's gone.  And it literally, like, shocked me.  You can't say that enough.  It's gone.  It shocked me.  And I woke up and my first thought was, oh, my God, something happened to the World Trade Center.  And they bombed it or something.  And then when it hit me, I literally just snapped to.  I was wide awake. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, it's strange.  It was on everybody's mind yesterday when it happened.  And then the only break I got from it was the short sleep that I did get.  And then the second my eyes opened, bam, it's back in your head.  It doesn't go away.  It's amazing.  To me, it was even worse today.  Because yesterday just felt like a dream.  Like, it wasn't real.  But when you wake up and you realize it really did happen.  Yeah.  It's almost worse.  Yeah, the depression and then the anger just will not go away until I, I mean, call me shallow if you want. 
[02:10:00]  But the anger will not go away until I see some retribution.  Well, I think it's good.  I mean, it's good news that I never left.  And even better news that those pricks are alive somewhere in New York.  Well, hopefully they get scooped up and they don't either get away or try to do something else.  Yeah, well, yeah, that's the other part of it, too.  But, yeah, so I just want to let you guys know about that news. 
[02:10:30]  But anyway, keep it up.  And I'll see you guys around.  All right.  Cool, man.  Take care.  Bye.  Where do you want to go?  Good.  Just millions of calls come in.  Jay, what's up?  What's up, guys?  What's up, O&A?  Hey.  Hey, I work with this one guy.  I'm an engineer in Pennsylvania.  I work with one guy who knows one of the guys who helped design that building.  Yeah.  And a lot of people were kind of didn't really know why the buildings fell the way they did. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  Since they're so tall, they have to be reinforced on the sides with a hurricane-type wind.  Yeah, that's why the window is so small and thin and long on the building.  I think in between each window is a big steel, what amounts to big steel pipes that run up the length of the building.  Yeah, normal buildings, they're structurally designed for the middle, but this was for the outsides.  That's why the terrorists, when they hit the plane, hit on the corner, because that pretty much just crumbled everything right there.  You know, I wonder if that's actually, if the hitting on the corner was intentional, because it kind of looked like both of them didn't quite know where they were going to hit it. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah, I don't know.  Yeah.  All right, man.  All right, take care.  Thanks, Jay.  What's up, Martin?  No.  Tube construction, they call it.  Hey, Adam Ferrara.  Hi, pal.  There's my pal.  How you doing?  You're okay, and you live right there, too.  You're right downtown.  Right there, man, right by Washington Square Park.  It's the wind blew, and it was coming up 6th Avenue, and you can't really smell it. 
[02:12:00]  It was down there all morning, just cheering on the cops' environment.  The West Side Highway is lined with people with signs that say, New York Heroes.  Yeah.  And just screaming.  Great.  Where were you when it happened?  I was home.  You were?  I was sleeping.  Did you hear anything?  I know.  You didn't hear anything.  No.  I woke up, and the TV was on, and I looked at it, and I go, what movie is this?  Yeah.  And it wasn't real.  And when the plane hit, my girlfriend was at the gym, and I just ran out of the house  to go get her, and she came home. 
[02:12:30]  We met in the olden, and she was crying.  It's just nuts.  Was the gym nearby?  Yeah.  On 13th.  So you're wondering about each other and stuff.  Yeah, it's nuts, because you don't know what to do, and the phones go out, and you  know, email, you're trying to, I left cold in the house.  I know, I know.  That's what happens, you know, when you're right there in the midst of it.  And for relatives that don't live in New York, they just hear New York, and I think  people from Syracuse were getting calls going, okay, you know, people freak out.  My mother said, we opened up the map, you're only a finger away. 
[02:13:00]  How about that?  Now, your mom and dad, I know your mom especially, she's just like.  She had an evacuation plan.  Get the Chelsea Piers.  John's got the boat.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Well, a lot of people thought, my boy, where's my boy?  Yeah.  Send Weezy over there, she'll kick some ass.  How dare you?  Did you know my son was right near there?  Yeah.  A lot of people thought we broadcasted from the Twin Towers.  They didn't know.  I'm reading email going, you know, it was good to see that you guys were alive.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I should, you've got to read some of this stuff back there. 
[02:13:30]  Well, it was scary, because I called the office, I called your number in the back office, and  then I got a hold of, I called the house, I got you and your cell phone, I couldn't get  through on your cell phone.  Yeah.  So I gave my girlfriend, we have walkie-talkies that I got as a gift for something.  The two-way.  The two-way.  I got to take this.  She goes, what is this?  I go, just take this.  Here's the code.  I'm like, planning everything so I can keep track of her.  The walkie-talkie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just, it's, it's devastating.  And I got to interrupt you.  You don't even know how to deal with it.  I got to interrupt you, because Psycho Mark's on the line, and he has limited time. 
[02:14:00]  Uh, Psycho Mark.  Holy S, let's go out and beat up some cab drivers tonight.  There's the Psycho Mark.  Yeah.  No, I love this.  I'm going to strangle a first cab driver I see.  I haven't seen one all day.  Mark, it's not time to be strangling cab drivers.  Mm-hmm.  You're right.  I apologize.  Mark, I saw you on TV yesterday.  It didn't look like you.  I've never seen you so serious in your life.  Dude, I've never seen anything like what happened yesterday in my entire life. 
[02:14:30]  You were, you were right there when this whole thing went down.  Dude, it was right out my entire window.  I was five blocks from the whole thing.  I saw both the towers go down.  I saw at least a hundred people jump out.  Oh, man.  I saw that sick towel head take the plane right into the building.  I didn't see the first one.  That got me out of bed.  Yeah.  The first one got you out of bed.  Well, take us through it a little bit.  What were you thinking?  All right.  You hear the noise.  You look at the World Trade Center.  It's in flames.  What do you think happened?  What's going through your head? 
[02:15:00]  Absolute.  My jaw just drops and go, my God, this is a freaking movie.  I actually thought I was tripping for a minute.  Did you know or have an idea of why it was in flames when you looked at it?  Well, when I got out of, it took about a second and a half to look out the window right after the explosion.  And debris is just pouring out after the first hit.  And I'm just in shock.  You're like, holy crap, something just blew up huge in there.  So I'm watching to watch it.  Yeah.  And you didn't know what it was?  Well, we didn't know at first.  But then I turned the TV on and immediately they started saying a plane hit it. 
[02:15:30]  Wow.  So CNN reported it right away.  But you're still thinking it's an accident.  Right.  Well, you're not sure.  But then there's this huge gaping hole with flames licking out and people are jumping out.  And then out of nowhere comes a 767.  And this mother-effer just went right through the building, dude.  An entire engine, one of the engines comes flying off and goes flying down Church Street,  bouncing off buildings.  And it ends up about a block and a half from my apartment. 
[02:16:00]  You saw the engine fly off the plane?  Off the plane, bounces off several buildings and skids down the street.  Oh, man.  Meanwhile, people are just running.  So then about 15, 20 minutes later, the first building starts to collapse.  You could just look at it.  It's starting to melt.  It's, you know, molten metals just pouring out, pouring out of the corner of the building.  And I'm going, oh, this is it.  This thing's going down.  And, I mean, it was, I mean, I can't explain.  How do you explain the World Trade Center falling down? 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, there's no way.  Dude, I'm sitting there going, no effing way.  Yeah.  But as soon as I saw that second plane, I'm like, ah.  Well, that's when you knew it wasn't an accident.  When the second one hit, you knew it wasn't an accident.  Yeah, exactly.  It was meant to be.  So then I'm sure enough, I look outside.  The Fox News truck's right outside, so I help the boys out.  And I've been on my feet since the accident happened.  I've not had one hour of sleep.  Right now, I'm on top of the 34th floor of, right on Nugget Street. 
[02:17:00]  And I'm overlooking.  I'm actually with the Fox News crew, and we've got the picture of the building right now.  Their new valuable asset, Psycho Mark.  Gack, gack, gack.  Dude, I just want to say hi to all the truckers downstairs in the West Side Highway down there  with their WOW stickers on there, because there's a ton of guys down there.  They're all waiting to take some of this rubble out.  They've got maybe 200 dump trucks lined up.  That's hilarious.  You would not believe the vehicles they're pulling out of there.  They're just pulling out like a Suburban was flattened. 
[02:17:30]  Jeez, man.  I mean, it was just insane.  Yeah.  Insane.  And then last night, like at 5.30, 7 World Trade Center went down, and they were actually  able to get footage directly from my apartment when that thing went down.  Which is a huge building in itself.  47 stories.  Like, that was almost a secondary story.  It's 47 stories high, and twice the width of both of the World Trade Center towers.  And it's still on fire right now. 
[02:18:00]  There's still people inside.  There's one guy that took the flight down 74 floors.  He was on the 74th floor, and he rode all the way down a cop, and they pulled him out.  And he called on the cell phone.  When he got down, he made a call out on the cell phone.  He said, hey, I'm still alive.  Come get me.  He rode the building down 74 stories?  Yeah.  And he called on the cell phone.  How do you do that?  Dude, you just pray.  I don't know.  How the hell does that happen?  No, it's just a mess down here.  It's just a complete mess.  Yeah. 
[02:18:30]  And I got to go.  I got to get back to work here, and they need this cell phone.  All right, Mark.  All right.  Thanks for that.  Yeah, God bless, guys.  I mean, thank God I'm still alive.  And, you know, what can I say?  One day at a time.  Yes, how would New York have survived if we would have lost the likes of Psycho, Mark?  Well, who knows?  There'll be no more.  I can't get back.  Okay.  All right, after this.  Take care.  All right.  Talk to you guys later.  Man, all the rules have changed.  Hmm. 
[02:19:00]  That went down in Pennsylvania?  Yeah.  In Shanksville, just before United Flight 93 crashed, a passenger telephoned his wife,  told her the plane had been hijacked, and said he and some others were going to do something about it.  Mm-hmm.  So you can speculate, of course, that perhaps they did something that kept that plane from  finding its target, which they say might have been the Capitol, the White House, Kent David.  Yeah, it was heading toward Washington.  So, hey, who knows? 
[02:19:30]  Who knows?  I guess once they get the voice recorders, which is another thing.  And Giuliani and Pataki were on the news giving a press conference, and they held up pictures  of the black boxes of the two planes that went into the World Trade Center towers.  How the hell do you find that?  I mean, those have beepers on them.  They do?  And they track them down, right.  So if they're lost in the water, they can kind of zero in on the signals being sent out.  Yeah, sure. 
[02:20:00]  That works, too.  Sure.  How loud are those beepers, man?  Exactly.  I sure hope they do find it.  One of the planes, actually, the pilot had keyed down the mic when he was flying, and the  tower picked up some of the conversation in the cockpit with the hijacker.  And, you know, heard the hijacker say, do what we tell you, and no one will get hurt,  this son of a bitch.  Mm-hmm.  Did he say it in English?  Yeah, it was all in English. 
[02:20:30]  They heard it all in English, and they won't get hurt.  Meanwhile, they crash into the World Trade Center tower.  Bastards.  Response.  Yeah, that's what I want to hear.  I want to hear.  Encore response.  It's got to be.  Yeah.  We've got to blow up a country.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  There's plenty of countries that we know sponsor terrorism.  Blow one up.  Yeah.  Look, what's your response?  Well, that country's gone.  Next.  Next.  You want to take him in?  Yeah, but you know who did.  You want to take him in now?  Yeah. 
[02:21:00]  Go ahead.  So, go next.  Tom disagrees.  Tom, let's hear this one.  All right, Tom.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Let's let Tom get his point across, Tom.  My point is that if we go and bomb Afghanistan off the map, that's an act of terror.  How is that, Tom?  Well, first of all, the people in the street celebrating, and that's a couple thousand people  were a very secluded event, and even people in our government have said that. 
[02:21:30]  As far as going to war with Afghanistan, I think the, you know, with the unbelievable  support we have all over the world, I think it really is simply, we're coming for them.  Anybody that gets in our way is going to be sacrificed.  But you can't just start dropping bombs on civilians.  Then how do you think we should take care and get bin Laden, who is in Afghanistan, the  government in charge in Afghanistan, knows he's in Afghanistan.  He's protecting him. 
[02:22:00]  How then do you think we should take care of this, then, if not bombing Afghanistan?  I believe you send in special forces, Navy SEALs, and other high-level military.  Any resistance has to be dealt with in the obvious manner.  But I think if we react to American lives at risk, not only that, you don't know where  he is in Afghanistan.  He's hidden in caves.  This country is big.  The government knows where he is, and the only way to force their hand is to make their 
[02:22:30]  people suffer to the point that they say, hey, please, please, turn this guy over.  But I don't think that, you know, enough, and whether you consider these people innocent  or not, these people did not elect their leaders.  Then overthrow them, or pay the consequences.  And another point is, if Saddam Hussein had been killed this week, we would also be celebrating  in the streets.  He earned it. 
[02:23:00]  You know something?  You got a point, but did he earn it?  Yeah, I mean, have you seen the papers?  It's war.  He's another terrorist.  I just don't believe any more innocent people need to be killed.  And if you think anybody that lives in the country is guilty, then I'm not saying that.  I'm sure there are people in Afghanistan that cannot stand their government that are crying  about what happened to our people here in the United States.  But you know something?  What do you do? 
[02:23:30]  What do you do?  That's their government that's holding on to this guy.  And they're despicable people.  I mean, let me make clear that, I mean, redemption has to be achieved, without a doubt.  I'm not siding with anyone.  This is where he's been protected by the Taliban.  He said three weeks ago in a London newspaper that something's going to happen to the United  States.  What more do you need?  He's already tried once to take down the World Trade Center.  Hey, Tom, what do you tell the victims' families? 
[02:24:00]  That your family's dead, so now we're going to kill many others?  I don't think that's a necessarily...  What do you tell the families?  Let me read something that just came over.  CNN report from Ground Zero of the blast.  Workers are using anything they can find to pick up body parts.  Those parts and any bodies are being taken to one of several makeshift morgues.  What do you tell the families?  So, telling them tomorrow that we went and killed 10,000 Afghanis makes it better?  But we...  Makes me feel a little better.  We didn't go over there unprovoked and kill their people. 
[02:24:30]  We are sitting here, a country...  This country started a war.  That takes care of the world for some reason.  Yesterday was an act of war.  It is now a war.  War sucks.  War does suck, absolutely.  We did not start it.  Right, we're in a war situation right now, my friend.  And these people understand one thing, death and destruction.  It's what they deal out, and it's the only thing they understand.  So you have to give it back to them a lot worse than they gave it to you. 
[02:25:00]  There's no diplomacy with these people.  Diplomacy's gone.  They started the war.  They chose the rules.  You've got to prevent this from happening again, because next time it's going to be even worse, believe it or not.  If you can even imagine that.  Let me say what led me to this conclusion real briefly, and then I'll get off your show.  You know, really what triggered this kind of thought in me was the last thing the president said to us last night, and that was God bless.  And the Christian belief that only Americans are God's children is just such a disgusting way to portray. 
[02:25:30]  Tom?  I mean, I'm not a religious guy.  Yeah, right.  But the mentality, especially among Christians in this country, is that only Americans are God's children.  Tom?  And, you know, a lot of people have died, period.  It doesn't matter what race, religion, color, creed.  You know, Yahoo is now like that idiot you just had on, oh, let's go beat up a cab drive.  But what an effing loser.  Tom, can I tell you something?  This whole thing, the devastation you see on TV, is in the name of someone's God. 
[02:26:00]  It's in the name of their God.  So I don't even want to hear about anyone's religion right now.  I don't want to hear the president say God bless.  I don't want to hear any of that.  Because us humans have this twisted concept of what God is.  We might sit here and think it's a great thing, and God is great, and he will support us.  Over there, their version of God says, grab a plane and smash it into buildings. 
[02:26:30]  So I don't even want to hear it.  No, no, no.  That's what they do over there.  That's what these people think.  They think that if they do this, it will bring them closer to their God.  So I don't even want to hear any religion being brought up in this.  And they get 70 virgins on top of that.  70 virgins, and they stay by the right hand of God in the land of milk and honey.  Tom, why are you laughing?  That's what these martyrs...  Tom, you're laughing.  That's what they believe.  Well, I don't really believe any real point. 
[02:27:00]  But, I mean, and that's not...  I'm sick of hearing any religion right now.  I agree.  I agree.  What's up?  What's up?  You know, I'm listening to this peace clear you got on the phone here.  This is the reason we got in this place in the first place.  We got to lay down nuclear weapons on these guys.  You tell them you got 48 hours to put this bin Laden guy to our doorstep,  or we're going to start launching bombs to every one of these countries...  Hey, there you go.  We give them a little out.  We say, hey, hand them over, or it's over.  And there's such... 
[02:27:30]  I agree with that, but I don't agree you drop nuclear bombs on anyone.  Why not?  Oh, yeah?  Have you seen the footage of what's going on?  This is the only thing...  What has gone on is unbelievably terrible.  And this is the only thing these people understand.  It's the people that have created this atrocity,  not the people that live in the country that harbors this person.  That's my point.  That's all these people understand.  This is what they need to learn.  I'll break your effing neck.  And that's what it learned.  You ruined me. 
[02:28:00]  I'm my pal.  All right, bud.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Good point, man.  You know, Tom, we're done with you.  All right.  Have a good day.  And, you know, I want to say,  I don't want to feel like we were all beating up on Tom.  He does have his opinion.  I really disagree with it.  I don't think...  And Joe Foote, Joe Curry, he had a great point.  This is all these people understand.  About 48 hours to get the innocent out of the way.  And it's that kind of thinking that got us into this.  We've always been very peaceful. 
[02:28:30]  We've always laid back.  When we go to war,  we spend umpteen billion dollars designing weapons  so we could take a building out  and not destroy the hospital right next door.  We're pretty charitable when it comes to war.  And this has gotten us into some trouble.  Unless war is horrible  and an awful thing that kills a lot of people in a horrible way,  it's not effective.  It's effective when you see what happens. 
[02:29:00]  See?  That's war.  There are dead people that did nothing laying out there.  And you know how you respond to that?  by effing them up even more.  Because that's all they understand.  Um, Anthony?  Oh, yes.  Time to start watching TV again.  Another building's going to collapse.  Which one?  Which one?  Building 5.  I thought that one was, um...  No, it's, uh...  They're being evacuated from Building 5 area  because they think that's going to collapse.  Next.  Is that the one with the pyramid on top? 
[02:29:30]  I'm not sure which...  Do you know which one it is, Ben?  I'm not even sure.  But, uh...  Now we're just waiting to watch another building collapse in the area.  I guess recently a, um...  Uh, another building did collapse.  There are reports that a hotel has crumbled to the ground in the area.  How much more incentive do you need, Tom?  Phew.  You know, it's that kind of thinking, though.  We went...  You know, I've said this before.  We went eight years.  It's very prosperous, this country, for the last eight years when Bill Clinton was in office. 
[02:30:00]  And don't start yelling at me.  I'm not blaming Bill Clinton for this.  You know, I'm putting the blame 100% on the terrorists.  But it created an environment that made it easier.  Our intelligence just went down the crapper in the past eight years.  How many jobs do you remember being lost because all those bases were closing?  These are important things.  Uh, uh, the National Guard got cut back. 
[02:30:30]  These are the people that used to do flights.  Uh, regular flights over the country.  Just protecting the country.  Remember how good you felt when the, uh, National Anthem would play, uh, on, uh, one of the channels when they went off the air?  Yeah.  Years ago.  When channels used to go off the air.  And they would play the Star Spangled Banner.  The F-16 was flying.  And then, uh, they'd show, like, a kid in bed at night sleeping.  And don't worry.  We're up here taking care of you.  You know, that's what we should be doing.  We should be protecting our airspace and not cutting back because it's not necessary anymore because the Cold War is over. 
[02:31:00]  It just changed to another enemy and another threat that we never addressed.  Well, the money went to different things.  Screw the spotted owl.  Yeah, things like that.  Uh, social programs for people that don't want it.  I mean, the money that was going to the military and to these programs were very necessary.  And they were all cut back.  And now, we're paying for it. 
[02:31:30]  We should have known this was going to happen when they had this planned well over a year ago.  Anthony, just to quickly jump in.  Partial collapse confirmed at one Liberty Plaza.  So, you know, more, uh, more damage.  I just, uh, hope, hope they know to, to pull people back when, uh, things like this happen.  But then it just makes the rescue effort, if there are any survivors in there, that much harder.  The cleanup, the cost. 
[02:32:00]  Uh, Sergio.  Hey, what you doing, guys?  You're next on the O&A show.  Listen, I want to know, when are we going to start shooting, man?  Let's start talking.  Let's start shooting already.  Well, I, I think, uh, what the president said, for some reason, we have to be patient and that these people can't hide forever.  Which, which, you know, leads me to believe it's going to be a little while.  And if too much time goes by, it ends up like the USS Cole, which was bombed, uh, unprovoked in Yemen.  And we never, yeah, by Bin Laden. 
[02:32:30]  And we never answered that.  Uh, to not answer this is an insult to the people that died.  The buildings are falling and we're still talking.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Absolutely.  Lower Manhattan is, is pandemonium.  Buildings, yeah, falling.  Landmarks destroyed.  And, um, we have talk about, nah, we might do something in the future.  Be patient.  I don't want to be patient.  I want cruise missiles going off now. 
[02:33:00]  Man.  All right, guys.  Talk to you guys later.  Peace.  Thanks, Sergio.  We got battleships in New York Harbor?  Yeah, the, uh, aircraft carrier.  Aircraft carrier?  Yeah, sure.  You hear the, uh, fighter planes flying?  Yeah.  I saw them.  Overhead?  That's something.  That's, uh, a little creepy here in the jet, but it, it's reassuring, you know?  Makes you feel a little sad.  No, I don't want them flying over here.  I want them flying over there.  Oh, no, no.  Yeah.  No, I want them flying.  Yeah.  I want them flying right where they are.  Go, go, go over there.  Go over there.  What are you doing over here? 
[02:33:30]  Push them buttons.  Send that stuff off over there.  They got some, uh, they got some other equipment, uh, they could send over there.  Sure.  When?  Hopefully soon.  Hopefully soon.  I don't, I'm not a patient guy when it comes to stuff like this.  You know, I want, I want instant gratification.  They did it.  We know the country that he's in.  We know who's giving him support and who's giving him a place to sit his dirty ass.  Mm-hmm.  And why aren't we now bombing that country? 
[02:34:00]  I don't know.  I don't have an answer.  Do you?  No.  Mm-hmm.  You tell him, look, we're coming in a tent.  Well, let me go to Dimitri from Boston.  Dimitri.  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  What's up, man?  Um, I just wanted to say two things.  I was driving today, uh, through Boston, standing in a red light.  There's about three cars in front of me.  And later on, I see this van with two Arab-looking guys just standing right next to them laughing  about something.  And the green light turns on, and the cars in front of me go.  And I'm still standing there looking at them. 
[02:34:30]  And I realize that the cars in front of me just went, and nobody behind me is beeping.  I look back, everybody, five, seven cars behind me just standing there looking at these  guys.  Nobody is even worrying about anything else around them.  Huh.  People are, the lives of people are changing already.  We look at Israel that's been going on through this for 50 years.  Mm-hmm.  And this is what they go through every day.  No, let me tell you something.  I understand what you're saying, but this isn't what they go through every day.  The amount of damage and loss of life that happened here today isn't, uh, they haven't 
[02:35:00]  had anything near something as catastrophic as this in, in all the years piled up.  Why?  Why?  They have, they have, they have five to six armed people on every airport.  Thank you.  Another issue.  The people in the airport are security.  More than half of the people, they go through chickens in the suitcases to find out there  is anything.  You know why?  Let me tell you why we don't do that.  Because somebody might be offended that their child had to see a firearm today. 
[02:35:30]  I was at the airport and we were going to Disney and my son had to see a man with a gun.  Is this necessary in our country?  Because people are asses.  They're asses.  They live here across the ocean and don't realize what is happening.  Would you?  They will be offered a bulletproof vest in the airport.  Every day, as a courtesy, they will realize that they are at war.  This is the first thing they got through. 
[02:36:00]  If this, they need to, I mean, the lifestyles will need to change because, because this will  keep happening.  You know, it happens so easily now.  The security is fine, upping security at the airports, but I'll tell you something.  I would gladly pay an extra 20 bucks a ticket to fly if I knew it was paying for armed marshals,  trained marshals on every flight in this country that will be on that plane and everyone knows  that there are armed personnel on there. 
[02:36:30]  And don't start with stories of cabin pressure because of bullet holes in the wall.  It's much better to have armed marshals on every flight.  They will be paid through higher ticket prices.  I have no problem with that.  If I know that no one's going to pull a box cutter out, when there are people trained to  react to these situations and they are armed, you're not going to get situations like this  happening.  The Israeli Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, 20 years, not once their airplane will be hijacked. 
[02:37:00]  Not once.  But we have four in one day.  Oh, we can't upset people that write letters to the government saying, my little Billy had  to see a man with a gun.  I can get a vegetarian meal on a flight.  Guess what?  I want an armed soldier on the flight.  Right.  Right.  And you know something?  New York and put up some debris there right now.  If people are going to cry and say, oh, has it come to that?  You know, if it come to that, I don't even want to deal.  It has come to that.  Right, Adam.  Yes, it has come to that.  And now we have to deal with it. 
[02:37:30]  It's a new millennium.  It's a new millennium.  And it didn't start January 1st, 2000.  It started yesterday.  There was a little delay.  But this is the new age.  This is the 21st century.  And this is what we're dealing with right now.  It's like the difference between the 1800s and the 1900s.  And warfare between those two centuries.  This is a new type of warfare.  And this is how we have to deal with it.  We've got to put this political correctness and worries about pissing off certain groups away. 
[02:38:00]  Because it's going to be our ass if we don't.  We've got to get pissed.  We've got to get pissed.  Right.  Well, I'm pissed.  How about you?  Thank you.  Thank you.  There is no more diplomacy.  Anthony, this building is like shaking.  There's smoke.  I'm just waiting.  I'm so distracted.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, that wasn't going to go, too.  One Liberty Plaza is about to go.  It's already partially collapsed.  It's smoldering.  Just in case.  Yeah, just in case you don't have CNN on. 
[02:38:30]  They just show in a panic where people are like, get back, get back, move out of the area.  Just when you think it's over and we're in the cleanup phase, there's some of the same panic we saw yesterday in the streets.  Well, here's the details in this building.  743 feet tall, 54 floors.  And it looks like it's going to go.  Where is that?  Where is that?  Oh, boy.  They just said some goose-stepping.  Ah, it's Iraq.  And there is Saddam Hussein, who I, oh, please. 
[02:39:00]  He has to get it, too.  He has sponsored this stuff.  He has financed terrorism.  Whether he's involved in this action, I don't know.  I don't care.  He's guilty of other actions against this country and other countries that want to live free.  So he should have to taste some of the wrath.  Yeah, that building's going to go, huh?  Yeah, sorry.  They're making it look like it's going to go any second. 
[02:39:30]  And here is some of Saddam Hussein's quotes about what happened yesterday.  America reaps thorns sown by its rulers.  There you go.  The result of the thorns sown by its leaders in the world.  That's what the terror attacks on the United States are.  What else did he say?  Same stuff.  He keeps with the reaped thorns.  Let me go to Eric from Jersey. 
[02:40:00]  Eric!  Hey, how you doing, guys?  What's up?  Well, not how you doing.  I'm sorry to sound so excited.  But I just want to make a comment about what you said about how kids today in society aren't allowed to see guns  and the nonviolence on television and in airports.  I just want to give you a lot of props for saying that because, I mean, it's the absolute truth.  This is the day we live in.  If a child sees a gun or even if it's for his own protection, we've got to have a big uproar with all the people who don't want any violence and whatever. 
[02:40:30]  Eric, I'm going to cut you off because the mayor is speaking.  I want to see if there's anything.  Okay, absolutely, man.  All right.  Talk to you.  Day and age we live in.  Well, thank you, Rudy.  And on behalf of New York's congressional delegation, Senator Clinton, Congressman Rangel, our dean, Congressman Meeks and Nadler.  See, I can't stand the name dropping they do and they have to address everybody.  First, we've got a couple of points here to make.  First, I want to thank the governor for the great job that they have done. 
[02:41:00]  We have watched television and I have heard from more than a couple of senators that they feel as bad as they feel about this.  They feel relieved with people like Giuliani and Pataki down here in charge and keeping things as best as they can be under these difficult times.  So we thank you.  I also want to thank President Bush.  I spoke to the president yesterday.  He assured me that he was going to do everything and his administration was going to do everything that it could do. 
[02:41:30]  He said, you have a blank check.  And what we are here, what Hillary and I and the delegation are here to do is assess the damage, make an inventory list, and go back to Washington.  And I've told Joe Albano, I'll talk about him in a minute, and others, that we may need the kinds of help that are different than usual disasters. 
[02:42:00]  We not only have the so many people who have been lost and the buildings that have been lost, but we have a financial services industry that has real trouble.  We have insurance debts that are enormous.  We have everything.  All right, Chuck.  Thank you.  Thank you, Chuck Schumer.  The beauty of this display is that it's the federal state.  There you go.  Thanks, Chuck.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah. 
[02:42:30]  Blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah.  All right.  All right, where do we go next?  Make this up as we go along.  Hmm.  My God.  You know, we haven't taken a break yet today.  I know.  You ever think you'd see the day you do four straight hours of radio without breaking?  Breaking it off?  Well, unfortunately, it's situations like this.  You just, I'm so wound up and just annoyed. 
[02:43:00]  Let's go to Alex.  Alex, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I'd like to talk about national security for a minute and how many times it was breached  during the 93 bombing of the Trade Center.  Mm-hmm.  Those guys that were held responsible came to this country with invalid visas and were detained  at customs when they first arrived.  They were then let go on a technicality.  They then proceeded to purchase the chemicals needed to create the bomb that they made from 
[02:43:30]  public chemical warehouses.  The worst part about it is their van that they had the chemicals in was involved in an accident  on the way back from the warehouse, and it was impounded by the police.  And those terrorists went to the impound lot the following day, filled out the appropriate  paperwork, and got the chemicals back to make the bomb.  Jeez, man.  Yeah, just a cavalcade of screw-ups in that one. 
[02:44:00]  And that's just the way.  And then it just went downhill from there.  We didn't learn from it.  Every year it got worse and worse.  It went downhill because we didn't learn from it.  We didn't make changes.  Yeah.  I got to see what Hillary's going to say.  Thanks, Alex.  This afternoon to visibly demonstrate the strong commitment that we feel from our colleagues  in the Congress on both sides of the aisle, and the very strong support that we've gotten  from the president and the administration.  Before Chuck and I left, we passed a resolution 100 to nothing in the Senate, and it denounced 
[02:44:30]  this evil act of terrorism.  You didn't get a negative vote on that one?  Who's voting against that?  Who's voting against that one?  It's an attack on every American, no matter where he or she lives.  What a rah, rah, rah resolution that is.  We've gained a strong statement of our unified commitment to rebuilding and reconstructing,  as the mayor said.  So we will continue to... 
[02:45:00]  Send over Bill's penis.  ...all of our colleagues and the administration to make clear the extraordinary needs for resources,  not just today and tomorrow and next week, for months and years to come,  that will have to come from the American people and our government.  I also just, again, want to thank the mayor and the governor for their leadership.  It's like a friggin' award show.  I particularly want to thank our firefighters, our police officers, our emergency medical... 
[02:45:30]  My flip mode squad.  ...all of the help at all of our hospitals, you know, the people who've really been on the front lines,  and many of whom we know have already lost their lives doing their duty to help everyone else.  I don't know that there's ever been a time when an act of war, and that's what this was,  called into action, better prepared, more resolute, or courageous soldiers on the front lines to defend our country. 
[02:46:00]  But we saw that, and we're seeing it.  And all of America, from everything we're told and the response that we're getting, understands that.  And I believe that America will be behind New York in a way that will send a message to anyone near and far that, you know...  So you have to message to a bomb.  ...and America stands ready to defend what we care about, and that's this city and its people.  And I thank everyone who's really been doing the hard work of trying to save lives. 
[02:46:30]  And we have to continue it, and we have to do everything possible to make sure that every life that possibly can be saved is.  Thank you.  So why don't we, before we call it...  Oh, okay. Thank you.  All right.  Let's move on with Tammy.  Tammy, what's up today?  Tammy?  She wanted to say that Krispy Kreme Donuts saved her husband.  Oh, how did that happen?  I mean, I hung up.  Steve, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:47:00]  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  Did you guys hear anything about the Nostradamus predictions, the ninth month of the first year in this new century?  Yeah, the guy had a blue turban, though, right?  Everyone's been talking about this.  You know, when I watched the special Nostradamus...  Wasn't it Thorpe and Wells?  Thorpe and Wells.  Thorpe and Wells.  You know...  In the fourth quatrain.  If we read the third quatrain, the fish in the frozen fjords. 
[02:47:30]  Now, it could be anything...  Excuse me, Dr. Thomas, what is a quatrain?  When that came out, they were saying, and from this quatrain we can say this would happen in 1984.  Like, because the movie was done in, like, 79.  So they had all their predictions maybe five or six years ahead.  And we can say without a doubt that they mean 1981.  And those past and past and past.  You could look at anything and say, oh, a Nostradamus prediction. 
[02:48:00]  That would be higher.  It's called being vague.  Hey, Steve?  Yeah.  What is the passage?  Because a lot of people sent it to us.  Just in case people didn't...  I don't know verbatim.  I just heard an allusion to it.  Does someone have that?  What's that?  In the new city.  There'll be fire in the new city.  Something about the city of York in the first year of the century.  It never says York.  It never says York.  It never says that.  And besides, these quatrains are all under interpretation.  They're not even sure what code he was writing in. 
[02:48:30]  Right.  It's not even English, right?  At the time, they don't know what calendar he was actually referring to.  Because he was an underground guy.  We just...  I want the passage, just so, you know, in case...  No, I don't know if there's somebody else...  You can get it off the internet because all those sites have been pounded.  It was sent...  Let's read the second hot trade.  Crisp Grum Coating.  It was sent to us about a hundred times, and I'm pissed I don't have it in front of me,  but...  God, if this proves that psychics are full of ass stuff...  Call me now!  Yeah, you don't know nothing.  Psychics...  Crisp Grum Coating.  You know, green peas. 
[02:49:00]  Nostradamus loved green peas.  Call now.  Nine ninety-five a minute.  The quadtrades will be read to you.  Allow.  Yeah, I don't quite buy the whole Nostradamus thing.  But I'll tell you what I saw it.  Scared the hell out of him.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I'd just like to know what's next.  Well, we know what's next.  Let's go, Bush.  Yeah.  Yeah, we know what's next.  The next day.  I want to turn on the TV and see some action on our part. 
[02:49:30]  That's what's next.  Or should more buildings just fall down and we not do anything about it?  Did that fall down?  Open.  That's why I'm distracted.  No, it looks like it's going to go any second, so...  Yumping.  Oh, this guy has the quote.  Let's see what Sean has.  Sean?  What's happening, guys?  You have the...  Hello, Sean.  I think so.  My friend emailed it.  I got, uh... 
[02:50:00]  In the city of God, there will be a great thunder.  Two brothers torn apart by chaos.  While the fortress endures, the great leader will succumb.  The third big war will begin when the big city is burning.  Yeah.  And?  As the two brothers torn apart, the two buildings, the third big war.  Ah, there you go.  The two brothers torn apart.  You sound very good to me, man.  Wow.  I could interpret the phone book.  Yeah, I did the guy.  What happened yesterday?  Somebody wrote that one, bro. 
[02:50:30]  The two brothers.  Well, the towers looked alike.  West Coast Dave said the quatrain.  Yeah, unbelievable female, man.  It is not by Nostradamus.  It is a fake.  But I do remember something like that being said in that movie there,  West Coast Dave, on the West Coast.  Dave?  That...  When I saw that movie, it scared the hell out of me.  And I've always been looking for a blue turban,  because the guy's supposed to be wearing a blue turban.  Yeah, you know, someone sent us a math equation.  This is how crazy people get with all this.  Right.  Guys, something coincidental you may want to talk about. 
[02:51:00]  The flights that were hijacked were from United and American.  They were numbered as follows.  11, 93, 175, and 77.  11 equals yesterday's date.  Right.  9 plus 3 equals 12, today's date.  So that would take care of flight 93.  1 plus 7 plus 5 equals 13.  Thursday's date, 9-13.  7 plus 7 equals...  Read this. 
[02:51:30]  You know what math I want to hear?  If a bomb leaves the United States at 2,000 miles an hour...  And then...  The guy lost me.  It started off like, okay...  7 plus 7 equals 14.  Friday's date, 9-14.  Hopefully, this will coincide...  Hopefully, this is a coincidence and the terrorists can't add.  But if it is correct, there will either be acts of terrorism every day for the next few days or...  Oh, please.  I don't think so.  Math equations, no. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, they had to pick the flights.  It was a coincidence that there were flights that originated near New York and had enough fuel to go to L.A.  Please, Mark...  Stop it with your babble.  Mark wants to make a point here.  Mark, what's going on?  What's going on?  I just wanted to make a point about Hillary Clinton.  Okay.  Everybody forgets about a year or two ago when she was embracing Arafat's wife.  Oh, right.  Remember that?  The people and everything.  I just wanted to bring that up.  I didn't know if anybody remembered that.  I love that tablecloth on his head. 
[02:52:30]  Remember when Arafat visited the White House and Bill had just gotten a Hummer?  Yep.  For Monica?  Yeah.  Arafat is very, very frightened right now.  And he should be.  I'll tell you.  He says he's donating blood to go to some of the survivors.  He's just doing that too.  He is so scared now.  He's one of the real high profile guys.  And he knows where he is.  Yeah, everyone knows where he is at any given moment.  And he's very afraid right now.  And I think he should be. 
[02:53:00]  He's another.  He's a two-faced, despicable man.  Well, his fear should be justified.  Which is even worse in some ways than this bin Laden who hides out in caves and everyone knows he's a scumbag.  This guy looks our leaders and leaders of the free world right in the face at the U.N.  And lies right to him.  So, he has a lot to fear.  Tammy's calling back.  Tammy.  Hi, guys.  Hi.  How are you?  Thank you.  Good.  I heard one of the best survivor stories. 
[02:53:30]  It's really kind of neat to hear all these people and how, like, they survived just by a couple of minutes because they did this, that, or the other thing.  Yeah, there's some of that in the papers today.  One guy survived because he watched Monday Night Football and he stayed up late, so he went into work a little later.  A woman I work with, her husband works on the 92nd floor of the second building that was hit.  On his way to work, he passed the Krispy Kreme and decided, man, I'm not going to have the donut.  Goes up to his desk on the 92nd floor, decides he wants the donut, comes all the way back down, and that's when the bomb goes off while he has the donut in his mouth. 
[02:54:00]  Well, it was a plan.  Saved by a Krispy Kreme.  I have a whole new respect for that donut.  What?  Okay.  Okay.  I thought it was a great story.  You're a little too excited about a donut.  Nice game.  Well, I always liked Krispy Kreme.  It's an incredible story, yeah.  We'll set up a Krispy Kreme defense shield around the country.  Well, there you go.  Fear the giant roller.  All right, thanks.  It's nice and it's a good for something. 
[02:54:30]  Fear the donuts.  Jeremiah from D.C., right?  Oh, hey, what's up, man?  Yeah, from D.C.  Hey.  I actually passed the Pentagon yesterday on the road, and it's horrifying.  I can imagine what you all are going through up there.  But I just wanted to thank you all for, it's like you're echoing the sentiment of, you know, how a lot of people feel.  You know, a lot of my friends, a lot of people that I know, how they feel.  And a lot of news organizations aren't covering, you know, comments such as ours and yours.  Yeah.  They'll be echoing that comment. 
[02:55:00]  They'll be hearing it on the radio because I wish I could be on the radio for like four hours a day just complaining up a storm.  And it makes me feel good to hear it.  Is the Pentagon still burning?  Not sure.  I'm not near it now.  It passed yesterday, but I don't think.  Didn't they pull the people out because there was still another fire?  I'm sorry?  There was still a fire or something?  Yeah, there was some kind of problem like that, but I don't think it's...  I just appreciate you echoing the sentiment of millions.  Yeah, I kind of got tired of watching the news and listening to some of these anchors.  Yeah, being all diplomatic and it's not the time to be diplomatic. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, there are guys too that, I mean, a lot of these news guys are just up there hoping they win one of these news awards for covering this story.  And they're trying to get the little catchphrase, the little angle that no one else is getting.  And they're being very politically correct and stuff.  And no one is really capturing the anger of this country right now.  And it's making me sick.  Yeah.  Everyone is just pissed off.  And that hasn't been addressed.  Yeah. 
[02:56:00]  Well, thanks, guys.  Appreciate it.  All right, man.  Yeah.  Bye.  Should we take a break, finally?  What, you want to take a break?  I don't know.  You want to sell some horny goat weed?  No.  Yeah, right?  No, no, no, no, no.  Huh?  We go to Windsor.  You got to take a leak?  That's the only thing I got.  All right.  I see everyone else squirming around here.  We just went three straight hours.  How about we do like a two-minute break in?  We can keep going if you want.  Well, we could do that. 
[02:56:30]  I just want to get to John on line two.  Yeah, John's right.  Because that, like, he disagrees with me.  Okay, you know what?  We don't have to take a break.  No, that John with you.  No, no.  We don't have to take a break.  You start with John.  I'll take my leak.  All right.  And then you take your leak.  And then Adam takes his leak.  And we'll just keep going.  I'd like to.  All right.  There's John.  John.  John.  You better be there.  I hope he's got to take a leak.  John.  Hey, John.  You've got to be kidding me.  Hold on, hold on.  Try this. 
[02:57:00]  John.  Hey, Johnny.  He's gone.  Well, what he said was he disagrees with me about the bombing because he doesn't.  We don't know who did it yet.  How many times do you have to say it?  Oh, come on.  The guy said three weeks ago and won the paper.  Look, this stuff's coming your way.  And not only that, this isn't about who did it.  We assume it's Bin Laden.  Right.  But it's not directly about who did this.  It's about who harbors terrorists.  Who supports them. 
[02:57:30]  Who gives them the money and the training facilities and just the place to sit their dirty asses down.  That's what it's about.  This isn't about retribution for this act.  This is cleaning house for all the stuff that we've had to put up with for years.  This is, as I've said before, Michael Corleone, the end of the Godfather.  We take care of family business today.  Stuff that built up for a while.  Just because they're not directly responsible for this act, we have to clean up. 
[02:58:00]  We have to go into these countries that support terrorism and give these people safe harbor  and make them think twice and make other countries think twice about harboring them.  But there's no upside for a country to harbor a terrorist.  That's the point we've got to put across.  We've got to put across that if you harbor them, we will screw you up so incredibly bad that there's no upside. 
[02:58:30]  And Afghanistan was all mad at us because of the sanctions we put on that country  because they wouldn't turn Bin Laden over.  Right.  Give us the guy.  What do you want?  Well, give us the guy that did this to us.  You know why they're not giving us the guy?  Why?  He, first of all, has a lot of money and a lot of power.  And they need that, Afghanistan.  They're having their own battles.  They need somebody, a lot of money and a lot of power. 
[02:59:00]  But no one is really hurting Afghanistan for holding on to this guy.  No one's bombed Afghanistan for holding on to this guy.  We just sit by while the coal gets bombed and people die and we've done nothing.  That's why we have to go in and clean house.  Start with Afghanistan.  Make it so they have to throw him out.  Look, you can't stay here.  America's pissed.  You've got to go somewhere.  Another country now, he says, I would like to stay here and rest or get my army together here. 
[02:59:30]  Not here.  Get my people.  Well, oh, really, you do.  What's in it for me?  Because I know a bombing is in it for me.  If you stay.  Right.  So pack up the camel and get the hell out of here.  That's what I'm talking about, John, who hung up.  That's why we can bomb these countries without knowing, you know, who did this act.  This is a war on terrorism, not a war on the terrorists that did this act. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, we'll get them, too.  But this, all of a sudden, is a war on terrorism.  And it's got to be fought seriously this time.  Not a little half-assed, send a few cruise missiles and forget about it.  Hey, let's go to Ron.  Ron, who's in the Marines.  Ron.  Hey, what's going on, Owen?  Oh, Ron.  What's up, Ron?  Hey, I just wanted to call in and say how right you guys are.  It's amazing how much funding we spend on everything else, and yet we cut back on our national defense. 
[03:00:30]  We've castrated ourselves.  We did, and now we're paying the price for it.  We've castrated ourselves.  We've cut so much out of the military.  And people don't understand, not only do we need it to protect ourselves and our country,  it does give the country jobs.  Yeah, the economy.  The economy.  A lot of people make money from the military just being there and being strong and being  large numbers and having the bases around. 
[03:01:00]  Whole cities have been built on the fact that military bases are there.  And they cut these programs and the bases, and this money has gone to programs that are  meant for people that don't want them and don't care.  They're a waste of money.  They are a waste of money.  The top priority should be that things like what happened yesterday don't happen, and we  need a strong military and a strong intelligence agency to find out that stuff like this is 
[03:01:30]  going on and deal with it.  That's a fact.  And it's a shame that we've been going through this stuff for 10 years, and now we're back  in a corner to where we have to do something about it.  Yeah.  Because they just came to our backyard, and they screw to us.  A lot of people look at a terrorist strike like we saw yesterday differently than a military  strike done by another nation with bombers.  For some reason, the plane has to be green, doors have to open up, and bombs have to drop 
[03:02:00]  for people to go, oh my God, it's worse.  This is worse.  Right.  It's our own equipment, and it's equipment you take for granted that flies over your head  every day.  It was aimed at innocent people.  Yeah.  It wasn't aimed at a military installation.  But for some reason, some people can't soak it in as real war.  If you saw a foreign country's or a terrorist organization's plane fly over, and bomb bay doors open up, and bombs come out, paratroopers come down, and murder people in the streets, you would be like, oh my God, we have to do something right now. 
[03:02:30]  Well, some people don't seem to understand that just because it was our aircraft, you know, that was a personally guided jet fuel missile.  Well, we don't know who the enemy is.  Well, we know where they are.  Right, and we know who's supporting them.  We have to do something.  It was a strike just as sure as it was if tanks rolled across our border and shot them with their guns.  And guess what?  If they did have a military and tanks and boats, they would be landing on shores.  They don't have it.  They might have used our planes. 
[03:03:00]  The oceans, not enough to defend us anymore.  It worked for many, many years, the fact that we were isolated by two huge oceans.  It's not a fact of life anymore in this millennium.  We have to deal with this right now, right where we are.  Hell, these guys train right in Florida.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right in Florida.  We let them come over here and use our schools to teach them to kill us.  We've got to stop worrying about upsetting people and upsetting groups and put the magnifying glass closer to some of these people 
[03:03:30]  and find out who they are without worrying about stepping on toes or worry about a congressman that wants to get reelected  having to receive too many letters from a certain group or organization or whatnot and say,  ooh, am I going to get reelected?  We can't worry about this anymore.  We've got to worry about these people hurting us.  Let's get Norton in here.  Norton, what's up?  Hello, everybody.  Hey.  Hi, Adam.  Hey, Norton.  I'm just really agreeing with you, Ant, about I'm so sick and tired of being frightened of offending people. 
[03:04:00]  Yep.  I want everybody with a bad mustache and a hyphen in his last name to be bodily searched before he gets on a plane.  Right?  They're terrorists, and they were dancing in Patterson in Jersey.  Well, now, I'm getting reports now that that wasn't happening.  Somebody had made that up, and the police chief from Patterson actually called up Don and Mike and said that that absolutely was not true.  Okay.  Well, they were dancing in their own homes.  They were dancing somewhere.  I'm sick and tired of it. 
[03:04:30]  We saw them dancing over there in the Middle East.  They were loving it.  In Iraq.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They were loving it.  Running out of their filthy hovels and dancing in bare feet, these savage animals.  With their dirty asses that you know just smell.  Yeah, and the stupid peel-back foreskin they haven't washed.  I am so sick and tired of it.  There should be armed guards on every flight.  Armed security.  And they were talking about that, and then someone said, well, it's going to scare passengers.  Like heading for town, they're going to scare passengers.  Absolutely. 
[03:05:00]  I would much rather have a professional armed marshal, somebody that his single job is  to be trained in the art of taking out terrorists on aircraft, maybe the art of negotiating with  these people right up until you blow his head off.  I mean, it's got to be done.  This is the new millennium that we are living in right now.  Like I said, the new millennium didn't start 2000 in January.  It started yesterday.  This is what we are dealing with now. 
[03:05:30]  I actually was eating.  You know, I live in Jersey by the GW Bridge, and you can smell.  It smells like a fire.  Yeah, it's burning.  It was blowing up 6th Avenue.  Eyes of tear and everything.  It's absolutely.  They effed up the skyline.  I mean, you look at New York.  Every time I look at the city, I just get rage.  And what they did to the skyline and all those people.  I just want us to bomb, I said this yesterday, bomb the country.  Norton, Anthony mentioned it earlier, too. 
[03:06:00]  How eerie is that cloud?  It feels like it's the ghost of the Twin Towers.  It doesn't want to leave.  It's like it's a plume of smoke coming up from where the towers were.  That's just a reminder that something was there.  Yeah.  It will not go away.  Yeah, it's really, really disturbing.  I mean, that's why.  I mean, I can't even look at it.  That's why Friday and Saturday, I got to do bananas in Poughkeepsie.  I mean, I have to.  You whore.  Holy smoke.  You whore. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, my God.  You are truly despicable, Jim Norton.  I'm an awful little man.  You are.  I think the comedy owner is despicable.  I am.  Can't cancel shows.  Norton, how do you do that?  Do what?  How does a comedian get up on stage in front of a crowd that you know damn well is going  through the same thing everyone else is and try to make them laugh?  You know, you just try to rally.  I want to go on last night.  I really did.  It's not that you make fun of what happened because of disgrace.  You can talk about it, but I mean. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, that's true because we don't normally do shows like this.  So I guess it's just a place to get together and event.  Yeah, but I'm probably going to go on somewhere tonight in Jersey if I can.  You just got to get on stage and, of course, I'll address it.  I don't know how you do that.  You just go on a screen.  Yeah, I mean, basically.  You got to get it out of your system.  You got to talk about it.  I mean, there's nothing funny about it.  Oh, but it's like this, you know.  The show we do on a daily basis isn't quite like the one we've been doing for the past  couple of days.  It's a joke in four hours.  You know what it is? 
[03:07:30]  Because somebody on your show said it before.  I mean, can Hillary Clinton say one thing that's realistic?  No.  Can they stop trying to get the poignant quotes?  I'm sorry.  I didn't want to see them singing God Bless America.  I don't want my Senate and Congress.  She went on and thanked everybody.  You know, you thank the cops.  You thank the firemen.  You do what you can to help it.  And you figure out when are we going to strike back at these people.  Yeah, standing around singing.  I want to see anger out of these people.  Colin Powell is the only one with any balls in the entire administration. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah.  Newt Gingrich had some great remarks, too.  Did any of you guys see Schwarzkopf on with Brokaw last night?  And he goes, shoot, those bastards.  And Brokaw didn't even know.  He was really pissed, man.  But you know something?  I love that.  There's a guy who just looked in and said, those bastards.  You could tell what he was feeling.  It wasn't a written speech trying to get the next line that will end up in social studies books years from now.  He wasn't spitting out sound bites.  Yeah, I don't want to hear the word justice. 
[03:08:30]  We got a sound sign, justice.  I like when they're talking about punishing those who did it, because that implies big bombs.  That's what I want to hear.  I don't want to hear how resilient we are as a people and how they will not undermine the spirit of this great nation.  We know that.  I want a rallying cry.  I want we have nothing to fear but fear itself.  Let's go get them.  Exactly.  Exactly.  I want to hear somebody finally express anger.  This was our finest hour.  That's it.  That's what I want.  That's what I'll follow you.  That's the guy I'm going to follow. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, absolutely.  Are you guys in Manhattan today?  You can't disclose that.  Yeah.  There's still a lot open from Jersey, though, is it?  George Washington Bridge open.  It is open, so I can get in and do my set tonight.  Yeah.  All right, cool.  I wasn't sure.  How are you going, Norton?  I'm not going to play.  This is a set in the city.  Norton, I might have to go see it tonight.  No, because I want to see how you handle this one.  I actually went down to the cellar last night.  There was no show, but I just went down to sit at the bar and be with people and hear the speech.  Yeah, I think I'm doing a set at stand-up tonight, but it's just a 10, 12-minute set. 
[03:09:30]  But you just got to get on.  I mean, just to get some sense of normalcy.  I went with Lenny Clark.  We got on our bikes and rode down there.  He goes, come on, pal, we're going patrolling.  Lenny Clark on a bike.  Me and Lenny Clark.  Wow.  And we rode down just to see it, just to do something, just to be together.  Miracles do happen.  Yeah, I mean, it's like you do feel a weird bond with other people because you know they're absolutely hating.  And as far as whoever called up and said that they really don't know who it is, yes, they do. 
[03:10:00]  Yep.  And it's unfortunate, but you don't think it's a black guy.  You don't think it's a Jewish guy.  You don't think it's an Irish guy or an Italian.  It's an Arab group.  We know that.  All right, they found outside of Boston in one of the cars a videotape that had a fuel consumption information and flight information,  like plane flying information, and a Koran.  All right, that's not a member of the IRA.  Right.  It's not racist, but we know who's doing it.  And if they don't like living here, I wish they would leave.  I really do.  If you're not happy here, please go away. 
[03:10:30]  No, they're not happy that we're happy.  Saddam Hussein, let me see that quote right there.  Here's the mentality we deal with with these people.  He says, exporting evil not only wherever its armies are, but also wherever its motion pictures go.  Of course, yeah.  This is Saddam Hussein talking that he doesn't like our motion pictures.  Whoever calls them motion pictures in this day and age, they're movies.  We don't like those talkies.  If the American people remember all this, they will salvage their security and the security of the world from their rulers. 
[03:11:00]  We'll feel more secure when you're dead.  On the other hand, if what happened in the U.S. was an internal matter, the work of American nationals,  then the house dwellers know best where their evil resides.  He's turning it around.  Yeah, he's trying to turn it around because of the Oklahoma City bombing.  But no, we know who did this.  And we're coming for it.  And you're right. 
[03:11:30]  There was no rebuttal, as far as I know, in Yemen for the call.  No.  No, there wasn't.  They let it go.  They put a warning to Afghanistan.  They wouldn't give them bin Laden, so they put a warning.  He said, look, anything happens, we're holding you responsible.  That was the rebuttal.  After they bombed one of our ships, that's what they get.  A military ship.  What more do you need?  They blew a friggin' hole in a battleship.  Because they weren't allowed to man the guns like that.  Why?  You're afraid of Yemen?  They don't want to man.  They don't want to.  They annoy Yemen.  Stop.  They don't want to offend people in Yemen. 
[03:12:00]  Don't be offensive.  Right.  Jim, we're going to let you go.  All right, guys.  Let's get a little too crazy around here.  Take care, Jim.  Take care, boys.  When do I get to take a leak?  Whenever you want, man.  Okay.  We got Josh from D.C.  Josh.  Yeah.  Hey.  Pentagon, two days ago, or a day ago, my dad was in his office.  And some, I have no idea who these people are, I have no idea why they're doing this,  but they decided to fly their plane into my dad's office. 
[03:12:30]  And, uh...  No, I mean, I'm feeling this a lot more intensely than anybody else is.  Wait, Josh, so your dad's dead?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  I mean, these people killed my father.  They killed my family.  Right now, I'm 16.  I got 15 days until I'm 17.  And if we go to war, first thing I'm doing, I'm going down to a Marine recruiter's office  and filling out papers.  So I can go over there.  And I can...  That's what they deserve.  Yeah, I mean, and what do you think they deserve, Josh? 
[03:13:00]  Nothing less than death.  They deserve nothing less than to be shown  that their actions shouldn't be tolerated.  These things can't be tolerated in America.  That's not what we're based on.  I mean, we've let these people come here.  We give them a home.  Hell, we give them money.  Our government gives them money to live here.  And the thanks they have to show for this  is killing millions of innocent Americans.  Thousands, I'm sorry.  Of innocent Americans.  For no reason. 
[03:13:30]  You know, I'm speechless.  I mean, what do you say to something like that?  Your dad was just at work, right?  He's an Army intelligence officer.  He was sitting in his office.  Right.  I had people come into my school and tell me what had happened.  And I was devastated.  Nothing else to do.  I'm sitting there in my government class,  sitting there going on about what's going on.  And then my guidance counselor walks in the door 
[03:14:00]  and it drags me out in the hallway.  He said, your father works in the Pentagon, right?  Right.  Yeah.  And from there, everything just went straight down.  Jeez.  All right, Josh.  Well, thanks for sharing today.  I mean, there's nothing we can say to that.  Nothing.  All right.  Awful, man.  Thank you, though.  All right, Josh.  Awful.  Stacey's saying we're being irresponsible.  Stacey, what's up? 
[03:14:30]  Man, I mean, you guys are totally entitled to your opinion,  but I think you're being totally irresponsible.  In what way, Stacey?  You guys are inciting people to violence.  In what way are we inciting people to violence?  What do you mean?  Inciting people to violence in this street?  I mean, on our streets or inciting our government to violence?  How do we inciting people?  I'm afraid that you guys aren't talking about nuking and blowing up and hurting people.  You are inciting people to hurt other people in the United States. 
[03:15:00]  How?  Because...  We're never...  No, let me tell you something.  Hold on.  Slow down.  It wasn't an Irish person.  You know what?  It wasn't a black person.  Well, you know what?  The Arabs, anyone who's from Middle Eastern countries, are very obvious.  And you're...  By, like, advocating this...  We would never condone any violence to anybody that is in this country or driving a cab or  anything, because we never said that.  No, but you guys are working people up to a point that it could happen, and I just think 
[03:15:30]  that's a little irresponsible.  Well, you know something, Stacey?  I'm sorry.  I got a little worked up yesterday looking at two planes smash into our city, and it worked  me up a little bit.  You know, inciting people to violence, the violence I saw yesterday, maybe I am a little  worked up.  Stacey, we know people that died yesterday, okay?  Yeah.  Stacey, did you hear the last phone call?  A 16-year-old kid's father was killed.  I have...  I know people who are in the Pentagon and are possibly dead. 
[03:16:00]  I don't know.  I haven't heard...  I've been trying to...  So, Stacey, what should we do?  All right, Stacey, what should we do?  Well, if we all sing God Bless America...  It would be nice to hear a lot of other opinions instead of everybody who's saying, let's nuke  them, let's nuke them.  Well, you know something?  There aren't many other opinions out there.  That's the sentiment.  That's pretty much what a lot of people are thinking right now.  And we have put on the air other people that have other points of view.  Very few, and then they're called peace queers.  Yeah.  Yeah, the peace queer that I called up earlier, yeah.  I mean, I've been listening to you guys, and I'm glad to hear that there's a forum... 
[03:16:30]  Stacey, Stacey...  ...to be talking about the issues, but...  All right, but we're not controlling the phone calls.  This is what's coming in.  You're on the...  There's not many people...  You're voicing your opinion.  Right.  You guys are just also feeding the fire, you know?  Feeding the fire?  No, the fuel in the planes they crashed into our buildings fed the fire.  This is...  Aren't you outraged, Stacey?  Oh, I am certainly outraged.  And what would your answer be to the outrage?  My answer is to find out who did it and punish those people, not how innocent people need 
[03:17:00]  to die.  And how do we punish him?  And you know what?  How do we punish this guy?  How do we punish him?  Fighting terrorism with more terrorism?  No, no, no, no.  It's not called terrorism.  It's called war.  No, it's war.  It's still...  Stacey, take a flight from Cleveland to New York City.  I'll personally give you a tour of what's going on about three miles to my right right  now.  Terrorism and war...  You can help pick up body parts.  No, they're not.  No, they're not.  Terrorism and war are not the same thing. 
[03:17:30]  Innocent people were killed yesterday.  If we go and bomb the crap out of Afghanistan and don't care who we're aiming at, and we  kill a whole bunch of people who have nothing to do with, like, the military...  Then maybe they will think twice about harboring a terrorist.  No, a terrorist...  Terrorism is when you're going about your life and all of a sudden you're dead.  You're trying to work.  You're going about your life.  Your government is very just, very generous with its support in the world. 
[03:18:00]  It is pretty much the world's police force.  You're saying terrorism only happens to democratic countries that, you know, really aren't democratic  in the first place?  There's no such thing as...  No, there's terrorism all over the place.  You're saying it's only to just countries.  No, I'm saying this is our version of what happened yesterday.  These are who terrorized us.  We didn't ask for this.  We didn't do anything that justified them doing this. 
[03:18:30]  Now our response is going to be harder than what they dealt us.  This is the only language they understand.  And bin Laden is being supported by Afghanistan.  Well, I'm going to cut off.  Hey, I'm all for going and, you know, killing the people in the military who, like, were helping  to orchestrate this.  It wasn't the military.  And...  Can you hear me?  Yeah.  Wait, Heather's on the line with Stacey.  I want to just tell you one thing, okay?  My brother's in the...  Okay, he's in there.  They shipped him out yesterday. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, I know...  And you don't have any problem with, like, my brother going over there and risking his  life for your ass so you can wake up in a safe country tomorrow?  I'm sorry, you can't tell me that there's too much violence.  The only language these people are going to understand is if you blow up their family  and make them suffer the way that we are.  Uh-huh.  Last person to suffer and gives up wins, right?  Right.  Or loses.  That's it.  Yeah.  I'm sick and tired of this country.  You know, we are a tough country.  It's a little something called Vietnam.  Same shit happened.  Excuse my language. 
[03:19:30]  All right.  Yeah, my father was in Vietnam, too.  We were killing innocent people over there, and what happened?  Most of the people who came back were shunned from society, and...  Yeah, I know.  My father was a Marine in Vietnam.  He came off the plane after being in Vietnam for three and a half, four years.  Came home after seeing what he saw over there, and some friggin' hippie pacifist spit in  his face that just provided freedom for him.  I don't want to hear things like...  Hello?  Hello?  Heather?  Heather?  Yeah.  The only language that these people are going to understand is when you blow them up. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah.  We claim we have all these balls, and, you know, we're like this tough country.  Kill them for once.  Right?  What about making friends and shaking hands in other countries?  That has nothing to do with it.  That same opinion can be handed over to the same people, and they can say it back to us.  You know what?  We're a bunch of assholes.  I feel this way because of what they did to us.  Mm-hmm.  I didn't go over there and drop a bomb on them because I just felt like for the hell of it.  Right.  I felt like killing people.  It's not the same thing if we do it to them. 
[03:20:30]  It is a response to their terrorism.  Right.  And it's all they understand.  So you're saying we can't fight violence with violence?  Is that what you're saying?  I'm saying it's not the intelligent thing to do.  Oh, God.  Yes, it is.  They don't understand intelligence.  You're going to reason with someone that thinks that if they fly a plane into a building,  they're going to get closer to God?  You're going to reason with that person?  What do you think the political correct thing to do is request it?  Have you got it from them?  Having higher military presence probably would not have stopped this thing from happening. 
[03:21:00]  Maybe it didn't happen.  They had fantastic knives.  We weren't looking behind our backs, but now we're going to shove it in their face.  We should shove it in their face.  Should we also intern all the Afghanis and Arabian people or people from the Middle East  just like we did during World War II?  Would that help solve the problem?  Do we mention anything about internments, Stacey? 
[03:21:30]  No, but I'm asking you, would that help solve the problem so that we're watching our back?  You know what?  If we weren't so worried about people that, you know, and I'm not going to sound like a racist  because I really don't think I am until this whole thing.  Don't worry about it.  But what I'm saying is, if we're so damn worried about having a friggin' lawsuit up our ass  because of discrimination charges, then maybe these people wouldn't be in the positions to screw us as they are.  There you go.  We're all scared.  We're walking on eggshells.  Let's intern everybody who does not look like an Arabian American.  Now, Stacey, you're on the other side of the spectrum now. 
[03:22:00]  You went all the way to the other side of the spectrum.  There's a middle ground here where we don't have to tiptoe around and be so politically correct  and, like Heather said, be afraid of lawsuits.  We can go a little the other way, though, and look into some people a little closer.  If you're coming over from an Arab nation with a student visa and you don't go to school,  maybe you're doing something else here. 
[03:22:30]  That's not what any...  No, that is what I'm talking about.  How do you think these people got in the positions to get through two planes in 15 minutes?  How do you think these people got in the positions so that they slip through?  There was somebody on the inside.  There was somebody on the inside letting them in there.  Yeah, come on.  Okay, well, and even if there wasn't, okay?  The reason that those people were in the job in the first place...  Two different airlines.  Five planes.  Somebody got them into the country.  Stacey, Stacey, you're infuriating some people going to hang up on you now.  Yeah, I think what you're doing is working people up. 
[03:23:00]  I'm sorry, Stacey.  Because I'm advocating that we don't go nuke another country?  Okay, well, when they're knocking on your door...  We've got to make sure this never happens again.  When the family gets thrown up, we'll see if you're still saying the same song.  You know something?  Well, listen, I feel a little bad here because I assumed, and stupid effing me,  I assumed that if you were in other parts of this country and saw it on TV,  maybe you felt the same thing we felt just a couple of miles away  or absolutely at ground zero where this happened.  But for some reason, it didn't translate over TV, I guess. 
[03:23:30]  I guess what Stacey saw wasn't strong enough,  and we really, I guess only the people that are right around this horror  actually understand what happened because Stacey apparently doesn't understand.  Stacey, we're smelling death today.  What are you smelling?  You go outside, you take a breath, you smell death is in the air.  Maybe you need a little of that.  I want to know what she really thinks.  I mean, like, if this guy came in and her family was all dead in the air,  would you still be singing the same song? 
[03:24:00]  Would you still be saying that, oh, you can't fight violence?  If you watched your mother or your father dying,  did I not say that we need to hurt the people who actually did it,  but we can't go around killing innocent people?  But the people who are hiding them are not innocent.  It's called collateral damage.  Who is innocent?  What, the little kids that are screaming and clapping and caring at five years old?  They don't know what they're talking about.  Future terrorism.  They don't know what they're talking about.  That's called being innocent.  No, it's not.  No, it's not. 
[03:24:30]  It's called being brainwashed and being a threat to this country.  You know who's innocent?  The poor people in their buildings.  The poor cops and firemen that want to try to save people.  Right.  I agree with you.  Those same little kids that you're calling innocent  are going to grow up and carry guns just like their parents are.  They're weapons under construction.  That's what they're being taught.  Oh, you're going to go over there and teach them.  There's not any parents in them.  So we'll send teachers over there, Stacey, to teach them a better way.  It's a lost cause, the only thing we can do.  You can't teach a roach not to walk out of your wall and eat a crumb.  You kill it. 
[03:25:00]  That's what it is.  They're roaches.  You don't teach it.  You don't teach things that it's instilled in these people.  From the time they're kids waving flags, celebrating death of Americans.  Right.  They're not children at that point.  Apparently all the people grew up during the 50s and 60s and they learned that all the  communists were pigs and all the other racial epitaphs for Asian people in Vietnam and stuff. 
[03:25:30]  Well, apparently then, by your standards, then they would have to be considered roaches, too.  Because they were, because a lot of people, you know, back in the 50s were brought up to hate other people because of, you know, what the government was and everything.  We taught people to hate, you know, Vietnamese.  We taught people to hate communists.  And we evolved to have states.  You know why it's just as bad as the other people?  Stacey, I think you're entitled to your opinion just like everybody else.  Yeah, we're just as bad.  I think all I can say to you is that the same thing you're talking about is what I feel got us into this problem in the first place. 
[03:26:00]  I'm not naming presidents.  All I'm saying is that if we spent a little more time considering our own citizens in this country rather than going around and shaking hands in every other friggin' country, like you said,  and then they're talking crap to our faces and we're, like, sitting there smiling and shaking it.  You know, I mean, that's what got us into this.  Who cares about foreign affairs?  I mean, to a point, you have to do that.  I understand. 
[03:26:30]  But to another point, you don't give up your own citizens and you take care of your own country first.  Let's not worry about stepping on toes and take care of our own asses.  That's right.  We have to.  Where are we going to be?  Where are we going to be laying there with, like, bombs going off on our heads, blowing our kids up and blowing our families up,  and then sit there and say violence isn't the answer as your last breath coming out?  Hey, Stacey.  Why are you so upset about if we get blown up and upset if other people get blown up?  Because we do not have the same thing. 
[03:27:00]  People are going to die, and it's not right if they deserve it.  They got it.  If they're innocent people, they don't deserve to die.  You know what?  They wanted to die.  They wouldn't have crashed themselves suicide into a building and killed a million other people.  Those people did that.  Those people deserve to die because, you know, of that.  Where do you think that came from?  You think it was just them in a little country called those people?  And they just hopped on the plane, and that's all that was left is just those people.  They're ingrained.  They're in a lot of different countries in this world. 
[03:27:30]  It's not just a group that you can find and take care of.  You have to weed them out of the countries that support them and allow this to go on, Stacey.  We're not terrorists like you say.  We're not as bad as them.  Look at the last war, the Persian Gulf War.  We went out of our way to keep civilians from being killed at the risk of pilots.  We made sure that flight plans and bombs were dropped on areas that wouldn't kill civilians. 
[03:28:00]  Is that terrorism?  That's good.  That's wonderful.  It doesn't work.  That was the way of the 1900s.  We're in the 2000s now.  The new way is to F them up so bad that these countries think twice about helping these terrorists out.  That's how Saddam got away.  We were too careful.  Right.  Too careful.  That son of a bitch should have been dead.  We should have blown up Saddam when we knew where he was, and we were so worried about taking out innocent people, quote, quote, 
[03:28:30]  your innocent people, that look who's doing it now.  See?  All right.  Came back to bite us in the ass.  Heather, thank you.  Thank you, guys.  Bravo, Heather.  I needed to vent, all right?  And, Stacey, turn on the TV and look what's happening in this world.  Check out the front page of your paper, right?  Yeah, watch the people falling 80 stories out of windows to their death.  That just wanted to go to work.  Unbelievable that thinking like that.  That's the thinking that got us here. 
[03:29:00]  Mark, what's going on?  You're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi.  I just wanted to tell Stacey that, you know, they bombed Gaddafi.  They killed his son 15 years ago, and he hasn't been heard of since.  One of the biggest terrorists of the early 80s was Muammar Gaddafi.  This son of a bitch was responsible for so many terrorist acts, and what happened?  Ronnie Reagan sent the planes in, bombed him.  He wound up killing his daughter, and we never heard from him again. 
[03:29:30]  Goodbye.  That's right.  Never heard.  He's stricken his ass right up.  That's right.  I watched yesterday.  I was five blocks away when the building fell, and I say just, you know, do whatever you  can to kill these people.  All right.  Thanks, Mark.  Thank you.  We got the board out from Cleveland, our Cleveland station.  Dan, what's up?  Dan, you still on the line?  Yeah, I'm still here, man.  What do you want to say?  Hey, Cleveland is going nuts because Stacey is from Cleveland.  Right.  I'm the producer. 
[03:30:00]  I mean, I'm the guy that runs the board at 92.3, and Cleveland is just absolutely going  nuts that she even said she was from Cleveland.  I'm telling you that right now, guys.  I have a feeling the vibe there in Cleveland is a little different than she was playing across.  I mean, I just want you, and everybody wants you guys to know that that is not how Cleveland  feels.  She is one person in a huge city that's behind everybody in New York.  Oh, wait.  Her last name is coming in.  It was Stacey Bin Laden.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Now it makes sense. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah, we know that, Dan.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Later.  Thanks, man.  Let's go to Francesco.  Francesco.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, the remote safety check.  I don't know if you guys remember yesterday when there was people hanging out the windows,  and beneath them, the plane already crashed.  Those people had no way of getting out.  The stairs were gone, and the last chance of hope was people looking at them.  And by looking at them on TV and just watching them, and you know that there's no way  they're alive.  How can this freaking twat, Stacey, say something like that? 
[03:31:00]  These people had no way of leaving.  They're stuck up there.  Only God knows who can help them.  They had no way of getting out, and that's the only last cry for help.  It amazes me.  It's unbelievable.  I can't help people, especially a woman like that, saying something like that.  It's like choking her right now.  It amazes me that there's people out there like Stacey that think that.  And she is, you know, I hate to say it, but she is entitled to her opinion.  But I can't understand how you can watch something like what happened yesterday and have that mindset. 
[03:31:30]  We tried it her way.  It's been her way for so long.  We don't go into other countries and bomb them on the basis of them supporting a terrorist.  We haven't done this before.  Like I said, we're very surgical with taking out military targets and trying to save the civilians.  We've done that for years.  We're the nice nation.  You know something?  They don't understand that.  Unless war is as horrible as the war that was perpetrated upon us yesterday, for them, what's going to stop them? 
[03:32:00]  Oh, we killed some soldiers at a SAM missile site, but the kids' school and the hospital are fine.  No, you have to make them understand.  And they took advantage of it.  They were exposed to the milk factory.  We went during the Gulf War.  Oh, it's milk.  It's milk.  Yeah, it's milk that blows up.  Yeah, they moved right.  They started moving people to various hospitals and milk factories for the children.  You and your children are at risk. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah, they're building rail guns and whatnot under the guise that they're water purification plants.  You and your dancing children.  And we're being all nice.  Just what you said before, the fact that we didn't just go into Baghdad and kill him, Saddam Hussein, is a testament to the fact that we just don't do that.  Well, you know something?  It's a new century, and now it's time to do that.  It's all they understand.  The rules changed, and they changed it.  Right.  They brought it right to our biggest city. 
[03:33:00]  And now it's time to do something about it.  Our policy is that we don't assassinate leaders.  That is Gerald Ford's debacle back when he was in office.  The guy did nothing.  He ain't in office no more.  Right.  The guy, Gerald Ford, a waste of space in the White House after Nixon lost his effing mind.  That's it.  And lost the office.  They put in this Gerald Ford, who was never elected to office.  And he signs a bill into law that the United States will not participate in assassinations of people, which means we couldn't just go in to kill Saddam just to kill him. 
[03:33:30]  If as we were bombing a building he died, oh, whatever.  But we should have been able to send people in to kill him, just like bin Laden.  We don't do that.  You know something?  It's a different time than it was in the mid-70s.  Ford's no longer the president.  We're coming to get you.  Right.  Stacey pissed off so many people.  Chris is a New York City cop.  Chris, what's up? 
[03:34:00]  You're next.  Hey, Opie Anthony.  Hey.  My name's Chris.  I'm a New York City cop.  What's up, man?  Spent about 20 hours outside City Hall yesterday.  The other destruction that's going on is unbelievable.  What these people don't understand is the people who did this are like the army band.  They don't wear green uniforms.  They don't wear blue uniforms.  They walk down their streets carrying their AK-47s, and nobody cares.  What are we going to do about this?  It's crazy.  We're going to screw them up so they think twice about ever helping these people. 
[03:34:30]  You know, we have all these liberal people in this country, and, Opie, I'm a Democrat, but you know what?  I'm a cop now, and I see the way this liberal world thinks that, oh, we should just turn the other cheek, and we shouldn't fight back.  That's their army.  You know what?  Bomb them.  Don't do sexual strikes.  Bomb them.  You know something, Chris?  It almost worked in the past because you could protest here, and it's a right to think like Stacy or think like we do and hold up signs and really pour out what you're feeling in protest. 
[03:35:00]  And the results, you never really see them.  Absolutely.  The people that have died in the past have been military people, and that's tragic.  It's tragic, but they go into it knowing it's their job.  Right.  Nowadays, it's coming home, people.  It's international terrorists coming to your office buildings now and killing you.  So you can't now just sit back and think about it like we did in the past. 
[03:35:30]  Action has to be taken unlike it's ever been taken before, just like they're doing.  Absolutely.  This is a new kind of war.  We've seen thousands die and landmarks destroyed, and we can't deal with it the way we used to deal with war.  No, they're killing thousands of people.  When's the last time the United States went in and killed a thousand people?  They didn't even do it during the war.  No, we know where people are. 
[03:36:00]  They took surgical strikes, so they take out the vent.  We take out equipment.  Right.  We take out equipment.  We hit those places.  Well, guess what?  Remember that vent?  Yeah, but they're people with their equipment.  They don't have the equipment.  They're using our equipment.  They're using our friggin' airplanes.  Right.  Well, the best is I'm sure these guys probably got, like, college tuition payments from our  government to go take these flying lists.  Oh, yeah.  You know, it's amazing.  Hey, Chris, why don't you tell Stacy what you have seen in the last 20 hours?  I'm not going to joke.  I wasn't in the actual zone. 
[03:36:30]  I was right by City Hall, and I ran for my lives when that second building fell.  Yeah.  The black smoke, Opie, I don't want to curse, but that's the most scared I've ever been on  as a police officer.  You sound shooken up the bill.  My father's in New York City, a fireman for 30 years.  I'm a cop for about five years.  I'm going to be 30 years old.  And, you know, these people say, we should turn you to cheek.  My father knows people who are dead. 
[03:37:00]  I don't know if people that I work, not in my personal precinct, but people in Manhattan,  I'm sure there's cops that are dead that I know.  Stacy, are you listening?  It's cops and firemen.  You run in.  You know, people don't understand.  I ran in to help.  Yeah.  Like, I visited my father's old firehouse today.  I took the day off because I couldn't go back into work today.  We didn't get back too late.  I needed the day off, and I went to meet my father to his firehouse, and the guy's like,  oh, how come your son became a cop? 
[03:37:30]  Why didn't you become a fireman?  You know, a fireman's such a great job, which it is.  It's ten times better than being in New York City police law because you have all these  liberal people second-guessing your every move.  Right.  You know, no one ever turns around and goes, oh, why'd you put out that fire?  And my father said to his friend, he said, what, are you crazy?  My son ran into burning buildings?  You know, this is what firemen do, and God bless him, Opie.  You know, the building collapsed, and my job there is to get the people away.  The fireman's job is to run into that building.  And, you know, I sit there, and I sent you guys a message before, you know, about that 
[03:38:00]  liberal ass, Tom, who just pissed me the hell off.  You know, if maybe he would feel the rage I'm feeling if he listened on the radio to  police officers on our division radio screaming for help that were trapped on the second floor.  I have my wife who wants me to open up to her, and this is the way I'm opening up to her now.  She's in the bedroom.  She's listening on the tape delay of when this goes on in the air. 
[03:38:30]  And it's infuriating that we have people that, you know, that are dead, and there are people  in this country who just want to turn the other cheek.  They're saying you're inflaming the fires.  You're fanning the flames.  But, you know, you're not saying, you know, go to Bensonhurst, go to Bay Ridge.  If you see an Arab person, kill them.  You're not saying that.  And by no means am I saying that.  I'm saying, you know, find people who are responsible.  Find Osama bin Laden.  Find Hamas.  Find anyone who's ever committed a terrorist attack. 
[03:39:00]  You know what?  It's time to maybe do some surgical strikes on their neighborhood.  Some house cleaning.  You know, find Hamas.  Find the people who did the call.  You know what?  I forgot about the call.  Yeah, a lot of people did.  Nothing has been done about it.  A lot of people did.  Everyone just forgot.  You know, the people that were right there next to the hall, they didn't forget.  You know, the families of those people that died, they didn't forget.  And nothing happened.  They didn't respond to it.  And I will be so effing pissed off if nothing comes of this. 
[03:39:30]  I can only see a revolution in this country if nothing comes of this because of how pissed off everybody is.  But, I mean, we need the strongest response we have ever, ever done.  And quickly.  I'm standing underneath the Manhattan Bridge.  We got there about 10 o'clock after the first two planes hit.  And we saw the first tower go down.  I was...  Can I say shit my pants?  I doubt I can.  You're probably going to have to dump out of that.  That's fine. 
[03:40:00]  But, you know...  We're playing under the rules today.  Awesome, guys.  Awesome.  That was, like...  The best feeling in the world was when I saw our American fighter jets flying over Manhattan.  Yeah, it didn't really well.  Because we were hearing rumors that there were eight planes that were taken.  And, you know, there were only four that I counted for.  The best feeling in my world was hearing...  You heard the jet sound.  You got scared for a minute.  And then you saw the jet.  You realized it was a fighter.  You realized it was a good old USA coming to your rescue.  And another plane ain't coming close with that guy in the sky, you know? 
[03:40:30]  No, absolutely.  It was beautiful.  I just wish that George Bush would come out a little more stronger.  Like you say, shoot from the hip.  Yeah.  Don't talk.  You know, don't do the rhyming speeches.  Don't try to sound like Jesse Jackson up there.  You know, just shoot from the hip.  Right.  I understand you don't want to be excited.  You don't want to act out of control.  You don't want to be judged as irrational.  But show a little more emotion.  I want a little relatability.  I want to be able to look at him and go, yeah, he's as pissed as we are. 
[03:41:00]  I saw General Norman Schwarzkopf in two separate interviews.  The second interview, he looked even more pissed off than he was in the first.  Yeah.  And just like everybody, it kind of grows on you.  And you get more infuriated and more bummed out about what happened as time goes by.  And you just want some kind of resolve.  You know what?  Maybe you go to Afghanistan.  Like you said, you have 48 hours.  We want Osama bin Laden and his 50 of his followers, 50 of the people who conspired, because they are murderers. 
[03:41:30]  You conspire to murderers.  You kill American citizens.  You destroy American property.  Yeah.  And we need leadership.  You don't say we have an unyielding anger.  I want to see it.  We give these countries billions of dollars a year totaled in aid to all these countries.  It's about time we get some of that back.  And we help out whenever there's a natural disaster.  Who's the first country there?  Exactly.  And are our children waving flags, laughing at their misfortune?  No.  They fill out cards.  They send, like, get well cards to the children of countries. 
[03:42:00]  I mean, and they're raising their little animals just to turn into war machines.  And it's got to be stopped.  It's a brand new type of war.  And it's going to take a brand new type of U.S. policy, which doesn't include being nice  and being cognizant of people's feelings in this.  Well, one of the unfortunate things is it's not just one generation of people.  It's a generation that's my age, and it's their children. 
[03:42:30]  Because now if you go in and kill their fathers, now the 10-year-old child is going to grow up  and he's going to want to go kill Americans.  It's a vicious cycle, but what do you do?  You've got to get the people in power out of there.  And if they're not going to get up and do it, or if they don't object to it,  then they are partners in this terrorism.  And if you go along with what your country does, you're going along with it,  you're believing in their war,  than just as when we invaded Normandy, we stormed the beaches. 
[03:43:00]  They were in German uniforms.  Unfortunately, these countries, they don't wear uniforms.  They wear jeans, sneakers, and they have an AK-47 strapped to the back.  There's going to be some collateral damage if they go,  but I don't know who's the terrorist there and who's an innocent person.  And unfortunately, maybe some innocent people are going to die if we do airstrikes.  Well, I feel bad for collateral damage, but look where the Twin Towers used to be. 
[03:43:30]  Yeah, I know.  I've seen it.  I saw it today.  I saw it yesterday.  And I can't remember what the Twin Towers looked like.  I know.  I can't remember exactly where they were.  You know something?  It's strange to say that.  When I was driving in today, we were looking at where the Twin Towers were,  and I couldn't figure out how tall they were,  how much taller than the other buildings they were.  I'm like, did it go up to there or there?  You just forget, and you realize how much of the city was just taken away. 
[03:44:00]  Such an important part of New York City was just taken away,  and it just pisses you off, man.  Okay, Anthony, I'm going to get going because I want to cup the lines.  I just want to remind everyone about the innocent people that died yesterday.  Yeah, let's not forget that.  And the families.  There's got to be 50,000 families that lost people yesterday or know people who lost people.  All right, Chris.  Fathers who lost their sons who were cops and firemen 
[03:44:30]  and children who now won't have fathers if they were firemen.  It's just sad.  Give blood.  Donate money to the charity they're setting up.  And you know what?  We live in this country, and it's a beautiful thing,  and you have the right to believe what you believe.  If you want to be a liberal, you can be a liberal.  If you want to be a hawk, if you want to be a conservative,  you can be a hawk and a conservative.  I try to stay moderate.  In times like this, you know, you've got to return vengeance with vengeance,  and that's what it is. 
[03:45:00]  All right, Chris.  And just one more thing.  My brothers in blue and all the firemen out there, be safe.  All right, Chris.  Bye-bye, guys.  Thank you.  Wow.  Ah, Jenny.  Yo.  Hey.  Hey, darling.  Boys, I've got to tell you that this has been the most profound sadness I've ever felt in my life.  To view the democracy that I know took care of me every night when I went to sleep,  being attacked by this evil. 
[03:45:30]  And I called you, first off, to tell you about something that I found very inspiring to happen.  But I've got a couple more responses after that, okay?  All right.  Well, yesterday, in a profound sense of loss and weeping and disbelief,  I watched the television all day.  I tuned in to you guys for a brief while, and I heard somebody say,  listen, fly the colors.  If you do nothing else, get a flag and put a flag where somebody could see it. 
[03:46:00]  And I got myself together today and decided to go out and buy a flag.  And I went to some place I'd never go.  I went to Kmart.  And right at the door, they had flags.  And I grabbed the flag, and I felt a little corny.  I didn't know if, you know, people were going to be looking at me as if I was a radical.  Did they up the prices of the flags?  No.  Like they're doing with the gas?  About a buck fifty.  Oh, another thing.  You know, let me just interrupt for a minute.  But listen to this, fellas.  Here I am online with my flag.  And all of a sudden, next to me, around me, I see all walks of life. 
[03:46:30]  I'm talking clearly, you know, construction workers, guys that just got off the job.  I'm talking teenagers.  I'm talking everybody with their flags.  Behind me, people are excusing themselves out of lines.  They're getting flags.  Oh, yeah.  Before you know it, and we're all giving each other the hi.  You know what I mean?  We're going to...  Everybody gets a point.  And now there's got to be a rush to the flags.  There's got to be about 20 or 30 people, right, buying three and four flags at a time. 
[03:47:00]  I've got them pasted up all on my windows now.  But I need to respond to something that I heard earlier on the television show when somebody called in.  And Anthony, and I thank you for correcting him, when he said this is what the Israelis deal with every day.  Yeah.  Absolutely not.  In fact, if it wasn't for the Israelis, I dare say we wouldn't be the target we are.  Ah, the other side of the spectrum.  Now, let me tell you something.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Drop bombs. 
[03:47:30]  Everybody's been saying that.  That's the easy way out.  That's not the way we're going to do this.  You know what we're going to do?  We're going to mobilize an army, and we're going to teach them a lesson.  And we're going to take care of Uncle Saddam, who is definitely a part of this, who's definitely lending money, military strategy, and whatever else he can, because he got his ass whipped so bad.  And what we're going to do is teach the lesson that we taught in World War II.  We're going to mobilize an army, and we're going to occupy their countries, and they're going to be our bitches.  Well, that would be nice. 
[03:48:00]  All right, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Do you know what the scariest thing was yesterday?  The Statue of Liberty with the Twin Towers gone and all the smoke around it?  Oh, I know.  That scared the hell out of me.  Well, there were other, like, targets that you would imagine they would aim for, but they weren't just going for symbolic.  They were going for a loss of huge amounts of life.  Because there were other things that could have done more damage, but the loss of life they knew was right there.  Eric, what's up? 
[03:48:30]  Hello?  Hey.  Yeah, man.  I've been yesterday.  Oh, no.  The second building fell.  Yeah.  I was like, man, I'm fucking scared, man.  Wait, wait.  Eric, Eric, Eric?  Yeah, yeah.  That was the F word.  We really want this on the air, and we have no idea how they're handling the show down the hall today, so...  Yeah, but just try to, you know...  Try not to tear it out.  Do you want to get your feelings on the air today?  It's just that I'm really, you know, I'm pissed, man, because, like, I have two cousins and a best friend that went in the building, too.  Yeah.  And my cousin went down, like, the 70th floor. 
[03:49:00]  And, like, my best friend went down, like, the 50th.  And they found their bodies.  Oh, damn.  And, you know, I got called to see business, and they're going to find them, and then I kept calling, and they said that they left early for work.  And they were still there, and then, I mean, today I called, and they found their body.  You know, and I was listening to the show, and I heard fucking Stacy, you know, talking crap. 
[03:49:30]  And I was like, yo, you know, you know, my best friend's daughter's, like, eight years old, you know.  When she's old and she's asking, you know, where's that, you know.  It's going to be like, you know, she's like, oh, you know, be diplomatic.  You know, forget that, man.  Yeah, these bastards, man.  They got to pay.  They got to pay for this.  They got to pay.  I mean, there's no bringing anyone back, which is a bitch.  But, you know, we got to make them pay so this doesn't happen again. 
[03:50:00]  Too many people, too many people died for us to brush this one under the carpet or do a symbolic little throw a few cruise missiles.  We have to do something that will eliminate this from happening in the future.  And that means changing the way we deal with this stuff.  Because we can't just sit back and have had this happen without doing something about it.  You know, while she was talking, I was just, you know, thinking.  When she, you know, she's eight years old right now.  And when she's, like, 14 or 15 and asking, you know, where's my dad? 
[03:50:30]  I'm her godfather.  So, you know, right now she, like, looks up to me because she has no father figure.  How am I supposed to explain that, you know, he died in this.  But, and, you know, what makes me feel worse is that I helped him get that job.  Oof, wow.  You know, I just feel like crap because I, it's like, you know, I almost let him do that.  Nah, you're fine.  You keep looking back and back and back and tracing to one thing or another. 
[03:51:00]  But, no, the thing that killed them were those bastards that flew those planes into the tower.  So, you know, they should just take those, all those terrible asses away and just, like, kill them all.  You just, you know, hey, tell her, you know, he died in a war.  You know, because that's the truth of it, man.  Well, yeah.  Awful.  Eric, man, you take care.  All right.  Take care. 
[03:51:30]  There you go.  One of the, one of the many stories like that.  Just heartbreaking.  If the guy that called in, I was on the phone with a trooper.  If the guy that called in about the story with the three guys getting on the plane.  Yeah.  Remember that call right before I came in?  Mm-hmm.  If he's out there, call back in because there's some authorities that want to talk to him about it and what he heard.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I mean, then.  All right.  How do you deal with something like that?  You don't. 
[03:52:00]  How do you deal with something like that?  Why do we have to sit here and even deal with this?  There's thousands of those stories.  Thousands.  Thousands.  And this ain't even the hundredth of it.  How the hell are we going to sit back and bury over 400 fire and policemen?  How do you, how does the city do that?  It's not even 400.  There's thousands of people.  Yeah.  Well, they don't have any final numbers. 
[03:52:30]  But it doesn't matter.  You know, when recently three New York firefighters died in the line of duty.  Father's Day.  Yeah.  Or right around Father's Day.  The city fell apart, man.  It was heart-wrenching to sit and watch this.  How do you deal with hundreds?  We shouldn't have to.  And for some reason, you know, we do.  Hundreds of those fire guys.  Yeah.  And just thousands of people.  Yeah.  I'm so disgusted.  But maybe I'm working up people too much. 
[03:53:00]  Am I?  No.  Am I working people up a little too much?  It's raw emotion.  It's real.  It's what it is.  Work people up enough to get up the energy to swim over there and beat the hell out of them.  You know, if we could, as humans, you know how many people would be swimming over just to punch people?  I wish I had the gift of flight.  You know, it's so friggin' not right.  You know what?  You have to sit here and deal with this.  You know, I was going to go to more calls, but, you know, there's nothing to say after that last call. 
[03:53:30]  Yeah.  There really isn't.  That pretty much says it all.  We're out of here.  Man.  All right, man.  Ron and Fez will continue in New York.  Yeah.  Amen.  Yeah, just, you know, what else can you say?  Hang in there as a city and a country and just...  God bless the fire and police.  Yes, and sit and hope this is handled in a way it should be handled with some new thinking going into this, not the same old crap we've dealt with in dealing with this type of terrorism. 
[03:54:00]  It's a new millennium, and there's got to be new ways of dealing with this.  How about...  I hope this doesn't sound stupid.  Like, just, we'll do a moment of silence for the victims, and then we'll go to our sister station.  10-10 wins, and then Ron and Fez will continue, okay?  Cool. 
[03:54:30]  And we'll see you tomorrow.  10-10 wins, and then Ron and Fez will continue, and we'll see you tomorrow. </pre>
