<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a discussion of a CNN anchor's hair, followed by criticisms of facial moles on women, interspersed with speculation about related fetishes.  This transitioned into commentary on a TLC "Virgin Diaries" clip depicting an awkward first kiss, generating crude jokes about the male participant's arousal.  Further discussion included Danny's weight loss and smoking cessation, a comparison of french fry types, reaction to a "bertation lady" viral video, personal anecdotes about virgins and non-virgins, a caller's description of a redhead's pubic hair, and a lengthy tribute to the late Patrice O'Neal, promoting his posthumous CD, "Mr. P."  A caller shared information about funeral home flower reuse, leading to more off-color humor and speculation about coffin reuse. The segment concluded with promotion of a Steven Tyler radio show and a comedic skit, "The Anthony Cumia Guide to Psychotic City Driving," along with a humorous call from a young child expressing a preference for "boobies."

A subsequent segment began with a discussion of landscape photography, rapidly descending into sexually suggestive and offensive jokes about molestation and anal sex.  This segued into a highly offensive and racially charged discussion about Angel Adams, a 37-year-old mother of 15 children by different fathers, using derogatory language to describe her and her situation.  A news report detailing her struggles was played, furthering the hosts' offensive commentary.  The conversation then shifted to Reverend Al Sharpton, utilizing a commercial featuring him as a springboard for racially charged jokes. The discovery and discussion of a website called "CoonTube" further escalated the racial slurs.  The segment returned to Angel Adams, with speculation about her mental state and potential sexual activity in front of her children.  A caller, Holly from St. Pete, provided additional context regarding her boyfriend's drug dealing.  The hosts also reminisced about the recently deceased former associate, Blind Dave, recounting his life and a segment involving blind boxing that led to his injuries. The segment concluded with a contentious exchange between regular callers Jordan and Bobo, punctuated by insults and personal attacks, and further promotion of the Patrice O'Neal tribute and CD.

Another segment featured a phone call with Bobo, who was en route to the DMV in Jamaica, Queens. The conversation involved crude jokes about his bladder infection impacting his sex life, followed by an off-key, rambling song with offensive lyrics. Bobo then alleged MTA corruption involving prostitutes, prompting further vulgar banter and references to Jerry Sandusky. A "Battle of the Dummies" segment followed, pitting Bobo against Jordan, with Bobo attempting to participate while on a bus.  The latter half of this segment focused on the Republican presidential primaries, criticizing Newt Gingrich, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry, using interview clips to highlight Cain's lies about extramarital affairs and Perry's gaffes. Romney's perceived nervousness and Ron Paul's lack of charisma were also discussed. The segment ended with a discussion of pizza preferences and a "FU Line" segment.

A further segment began with a discussion of Friday fish fries and their poor quality, transitioning into vulgar reminiscences about the hosts' experiences in Buffalo, New York.  Kevin Hart then joined the show, contributing to a somber discussion about the death of Patrice O'Neal, sharing his grief and reflecting on O'Neal's comedic talent.  This somber tone was interspersed with crude humor concerning semen consistency and a listener's explanation of Catholic Friday fish fries during Lent.  Further anecdotes, including a Siri-related mishap, were shared, along with live reads for sponsors.  A phone call with Bobo at the DMV, where the hosts encouraged increasingly outrageous and racially charged behavior, concluded the segment.

The final excerpt featured another segment with Bobo at the DMV, where the hosts encouraged offensive and racist behavior toward others.  Bobo's clumsy attempts to follow instructions, coupled with discussions of speakerphone functionality and application difficulties, were punctuated by profanity and racial slurs. The segment also included discussion of an upcoming break and a Patrice Oâ€™Neal tribute.  The after-show, featuring Sam Roberts and Steve Sterniolo, discussed the preceding segment, an internal conflict between interns, and Sterniolo's phone-in radio show, including criticisms and listener feedback.  Numerous advertisements ran throughout the broadcast.

[00:05:00]  shit and uh she is just infuriating because her hair is so goddamn awful i don't know her name it's  some asian woman she's an ugly asian woman which is almost impossible too by the way yep you know  we all know that when the asians age but when they're younger for the most part they're pretty  fucking good looking and she's probably we're looking at a woman that's no more than 40 so it's 
[00:05:30]  not like she's she should be ugly can't tell if she's 25 or 40 you're kind of right about that so  odd when i just said 40 i'm like you uh give or take 10 years but then she has this fucked up hair  like it's wharf from from star trek yeah it's it's she's got wharf hair klingon hair it comes  from the top of her head and then wraps around her head in this odd i can't even describe it it's  like uh i'm uh what the fuck was that thing growing up where it was those uh those uh light 
[00:06:00]  beams those uh uh help me out fuck like a troll doll like a troll doll sure troll doll hair but  remember the other thing where lights went through it individual like optics oh fiber optic  he's running he's chugging down the hallway you know what i'm talking about right what is i think  what i think you're talking about is like those fiber optics yes uh but they they popped up and 
[00:06:30]  then kind of fell to the side it was like like shitty things that you would put on like an end table  yeah yeah right some awful tacky individual light would go through the optics yeah she has hair like  that yeah by the way you just sprinted down the hall that was very impressive i haven't seen  anyone run around here in years i hate when like i hear something and i'm like oh i could add to that  but i need to obviously get there immediately right i know that run down the hallway and then i'm like  yeah what i want to tell you about about you're in shape now though danny it's not the old danny 
[00:07:00]  you can you can handle a run down the hall now well i used to be and then i i stopped doing all  those things that made me in shape so i'm i'm just i weigh less you're maintaining and how long  has it been since you smoked oh jesus christ uh five years about almost almost wow wow yeah danny's  kind of changed his whole fucking life man good thing you cut off those cigarettes yeah man i never  expected to quit either less booze no smokes and uh and and he told me 30 pounds he's down yeah that's 
[00:07:30]  fucked up that's well you know what it's not so much that it's fucked up i lost all that weight  it's fucked up to think that i actually weighed that much that's what's fucked up this is just  how much did you weigh when you first joined us i was about like a buck 55 i guess so you're right  around the your starting weight just about maybe a few pounds heavier now like maybe 158  damn i hope you're bad hope b-rock's listening that's not bad it's possible high school weight  when you're 30 right yeah but this woman on cnn and then she has a bury on her face it's like just  fucking shave that shit off man it's not even sexy on cindy crawford anymore oh god no i just don't 
[00:08:00]  wait when i see women like that and they have that one fucking dark mole all i think is that's a spot  of duty on her face duty i can't get past that and especially when it's in an area that you'd be  kissing you know it's like cindy crawford's got that it's like dude i never thought it was a a sexy  mole on her by the way oh you know the rest of her was so over the top fucking hot yeah yeah that it 
[00:08:30]  didn't matter i guess but i never thought the mole itself was sexy you know there's gonna be like  a big thick dog hair poking out even if you even if you shave it down you know there's gonna be that  one it's gonna be a stubble like that one like that thing on brundle's back  look at that uh see we're looking at an old picture cindy crawford and if she would have just  got rid of that mole now it's probably too late like it would it's because it's bigger now it would  be a chore well they like to dig in moles like to dig in they go deeper hunker down oh yeah i had a 
[00:09:00]  few removed where i had to have a stitch because they had to dig it out oh yeah man i'm all about  mole removal i don't i don't do much to to help my appearance but the one thing was moles trying to  get rid of these fucking things yeah i don't like the ones by the lips and stuff no you gotta you gotta  no man yeah this guy i grew up with he had a mole that was like right on his on his lip like where 
[00:09:30]  his mustache would be really and uh yeah so you know he didn't get 12 years of being called shit  lip and he did have it removed but you know what the funny part i get i guess it's preference because  you know he had it removed so late in life it was like what was the point like you already got you  already went through all the torment right yeah the school years and everything where it really that's  where it really hurt yeah maybe back then it was harder to get rid of him i don't know i have no idea  but i mean they run specials and everything they'll they'll take 20 moles off your body for the 
[00:10:00]  price of 200 bucks or something yeah what's what's his name iglesias there no yeah iglesias  yeah he had a giant thing he knows what i'm talking about yeah get that bury off your face  he had that aaron neville thing going on where it's just giant anyone have buries on their faces  around here sam that i now have to awkwardly walk past you've alienated i don't think so let's point  out berries on faces today from now on we should oh jesus i'm trying to think of anybody around here 
[00:10:30]  as berries maybe we're all blessed i'm not saying we're blessed this is my preference face berries  standalone fruit yeah oh just kidding 20 after the hour let's see i'm gonna leave that one alone  good for you yeah i'm gonna leave that alone bigger man yeah i'm gonna try to leave that one alone  not alone no it's just preference i mean i'm sure there's guys out there that  enjoy a woman that has a berry on on the face and probably really spends a lot of time just 
[00:11:00]  focusing on it and licking it and kissing it i don't know getting that one one hair in between  their teeth as they're biting it yeah i bet there's nobody that has that preference uh-huh i don't think  there's anybody that's actually attracted to moles i bet there are people that don't mind berries  then why aren't the women getting them off their face i don't know they should i don't i i don't  think anyone is attracted to the the berries on the face i don't think anybody is i'll tell you guys  there's something called rule 34 and what rule 34 dictates is that on the internet anything that can 
[00:11:30]  be sexual is sexual so i bet you if you dig deep and you look hard enough you will find some kind of  face berry fetish website where there's nothing but pictures of chicks with berries on their face  getting come all over them i bet you there's somebody that jerks off to face berries yes you're  right yeah somebody out there all right people are twisted i know we're a little late to the party  but you saw the virgin kiss right by now the what the virgin the virgin's kissing when they got married 
[00:12:00]  the tlc clip i have not seen this you found the website hot well it's fetish friday it's it's it's not  like a porn website hot women with moles hot women with moles yeah cindy crawford that's obviously  cindy crawford and that's sam looking so if i was looking yeah exactly all right sam who where's the  mole on this broad right there where oh next to our schnozola but these are women that would be hot  without them it's not the mole that makes these women good looking but the problem is when the mole

[00:29:30]  windows open every so often air that fucker out yeah like an old linen closet probably shouldn't  be a flavor saver down there no but but let me tell you you dig right the fuck in there was no  there was no like oh i wish she'd do this or that or anything well we didn't know put your face right  in that no there was a time that wasn't even an option you weren't out you were you were never  thinking oh i wish she uh wish she shaved everything off yeah yeah first time you saw that 
[00:30:00]  it was fucking weird if you think about it yeah oh the first shaved yes oh yeah yeah yeah now it's  now yeah right on i'm all in but the first time you saw that you're like what the fuck are you a freak  i don't think i could even remember the first time i saw a shaved one oh yeah was it slutty girls that  started doing it or did people just start doing that i think strippers were like the first ones  that did it most likely was strippers and it wasn't i don't think i went from full hairy pussy 
[00:30:30]  seeing that to full shaved i think i saw like some shaved down versions well you got to see the  evolution yeah because i think that would have been freakish to just all of a sudden see ah there's  nothing there was it was your pussy on the chemo it was kind of like the rainforest it was slowly  going away slowly losing it i mean if you you know year to year you're like ah the rainforest is fine  still there it's kind of just slowly going away but then if you go from uh you know a picture 10  years ago to now you realize now you're like holy fuck there's nothing down there anymore some 
[00:31:00]  defoliant some agent orange yeah uh but the first time you saw it you're like you are a freak you're  a whore but guys must have looked odd though back in the day uh eating some snatch and when when she  looked down at you right you just got this big fucking groucho marx mustache it must have just looked  like you had a giant mustache and beard and shit i was like you know they had they had hair you  fucking most guys were growing mustaches and yeah there's just hair everywhere hairy does 
[00:31:30]  look at that yeah who is that movie reviewer that's who you look like  gene shallot every guy eating snatch looked like gene shallot back then that's really funny oh fuck  man gene shallot but again you just didn't fucking care it was so it was so cool to see just that  fucking look at that two legs some hair and no dick carolina man's going racing stripe the the problem 
[00:32:00]  with the racing stripe was you know then they laid down and it's like wait the racing stripe is way too far  away from the action yeah yeah but if they're standing it's okay i don't i don't understand  when they shave the pussy like that and shave away the hair all the hair from the pussy area right and  just leave the triangle yeah at the top you'd look and realize when they laid down it looked silly it  looked way too far away the hair is like an island hoasis away from the snatch and shit 
[00:32:30]  very uh delicate maneuver shaving that thing girls yeah nobody wants to ship to it no it's just too far  oh tony from brooklyn i think this is one of anthony's uh classic lines go ahead tony  i wish i would have said this but i never laughed so hard a guy called in you guys were talking about  redheads and hairy pussies and the guy said yeah it looks like an irish center with a wet mouth  yeah yeah all right brother yeah that's still right in the back of our heads don't you oh yeah 
[00:33:00]  confused man i'm fucking walking around like a goddamn zombie yeah and um i guess monday is uh  the memorial huh yep it's gonna be a long weekend oh i know which is okay i i you know but it's just  like fuck and we've all been through it i just can't wait till it's all over with tell you the  truth yeah i'm be honest with you i don't like this stuff no i wish i could time travel does i 
[00:33:30]  wish i could time travel to tuesday because then it is what it is you know what i mean you'd be bummed  if somebody said you could time travel till friday you just wish you could time travel till tuesday  it's like no i'm not gonna time travel till friday yeah yeah it would be nice that shit is  getting over with right in front of us still man and will be for a really long time but we're gonna  run a uh an amazing special this weekend on the channel it's i think it's 16 hours of material  iraq told me 16 hours it's gonna play like three different times or something i fucking was listening 
[00:34:00]  to what i like to call the shit show yesterday yeah your name for it and no it's a lot of people  believe me you uh just ask adam walsh yeah you prove that it's a shit show yeah you don't even  know people's names no that's only on the only on a shit show that would happen i knew his name  it was a mistake oh some epic proportion huge mistake huge mistake epic fail epic fail how large  mistake it was yeah very uh but i was listening and i heard the uh bit uh a little bit of patrice 
[00:34:30]  with gallagher oh my god that was hilarious yeah fucking unbelievably funny yeah every time  every time gallagher thought that he had moved on yes patrice brought it back like gallagher was  talking about other countries and you hear patrice go yeah what about africa yeah  gallagher whining when he did what did patrice say something like uh your name should be gal nigga  hey wouldn't leave it alone oh fucking great he just kept bringing it back yeah i mean everything 
[00:35:00]  that's going to be in its entirety this week yeah yeah every everything you could think of  we're going to put on and uh i think we mentioned it yesterday but um patrice was working on a cd  this isn't one of these things they they threw together because patrice died no he was getting  ready to release a cd and um everything was everything was complete i mean he this is something that he  wanted out there yeah which is kind of cool because sometimes when people die then you know friends and 
[00:35:30]  family try to throw something together but they're not really sure if this is what the guy wanted and  but this was patrice's uh cd that he was proud of and it was about to hit and um it's called mr p  and the reason why it's called mr p which kills me jonathan told me yesterday in the car is because  his stepdaughter used to call him mr p which is just gonna make me fucking lose it again but um  it's on itunes and the record company adjusted their deal jonathan said all this yesterday but i want 
[00:36:00]  to make sure we say it again adjusted the adjusted the deal so the family gets the money yeah and  trust me without getting into it they need the money okay they need the money so if you i mean if  you're a fan of patrice and i know a lot of people like what can i do what can i do you know simply  fucking order the goddamn cd it's on amazon and it's on itunes it's mr p it's doing really well on  itunes but if we can keep it in like the top 10 list yeah you got we got to keep it up there for a  while yep for a while but it's called mr p and jonathan said the fucking thing is brilliant he 
[00:36:30]  says this thing is brilliant yeah so and i got a copy yesterday and i i popped it into my uh macbook  and then i was like i can't listen to this yeah it's pretty difficult to listen to uh certain things  but yeah in time in time and it's sad because patrice in death is going to be a massive fucking star  yeah massive star and it's too bad because you know all this material was out there for the people but 
[00:37:00]  it takes someone dying for them to discover it i guess yeah so weird to me but this guy is going to  be a massive star i was thinking about because no one can imitate patrice yep there are comics that are  amazing absolutely amazing i'm not gonna name names but you see other people imitating them which  almost takes away from what that guy is true and uh with patrice i i've been thinking hard about it  it's impossible to imitate this guy his take on things and his angle you could even try to do his 
[00:37:30]  bits word for word yeah and you're not going to pull it off like him yeah that's because it wasn't uh  just going up and doing a character on stage right that's that's him right that's who he was and he  had such a strong personality uh and brought that right up to the stage so if any comic went up there  and tried to right imitate you know or take his style right it would never work i really think in this  case it's it's impossible yeah yeah not even almost impossible i think this one is impossible and 
[00:38:00]  that's why this guy is gonna be fucking huge in death man yeah which sucks because we all we all  knew patrice very well and he just wanted fame to call on his terms and we used to joke about it we  used to go patrice did fame call he's like getting close yeah heard a little little shaking of the  phone it's getting ready yeah it would have been nice to see him get to the point where he completely  blew us off yeah fame was fame was gonna call on his terms finally real fame yep that next level of 
[00:38:30]  fame because a lot of people like well he was famous already now yes but in the world we live  in there are there are levels of it and he was ready to go to that next fucking level yeah it'll  take a little time for people to you know discover him and stuff like that and you know word of mouth  kind of a thing and and stuff like that but yeah i have no doubt yeah so motherfucker that guy had  to fucking say patrice in the phone call i know right no i'm not i'm not i'm not beating anyone 
[00:39:00]  i know yeah yeah it's even tough to take phone calls about him we're in the middle of fucking  talking about the hairy pussy snitch hairy pussy dirty snatch it's odd though because uh even before  that guy called up and mentioned patrice when we were talking about hairy pussy and eating hairy  pussy and shit like that i i was just thinking what would patrice have said about that subject you know  you just can't get it out of your mind are you creeped out looking at that spot right i know we 
[00:39:30]  keep like anytime you talk about him you kind of look over at the seat are you yeah yeah because i had  i had a thought i we got to change something in the studio i'm serious yeah because it's creeping me out  yeah i don't know what just a subtle change but uh it wouldn't creep me out if we had a picture of  him in the studio or something something like that would not creep me out but just seeing where he used  to sit yeah it's really bothersome especially like when jimmy's out because you know he probably would  have been here yeah oh yeah today today patrice would have absolutely been yeah absolutely would  have been it yeah that's uh that sucks i'm gonna get a little uh brass plate for my grill and make 
[00:40:00]  it the patrice o'neill memorial grill because no one rocked that thing like patrice did nice yeah so  yeah just tell people to buy the cd instead of sending flowers yeah that's a good idea i think  flowers flowers are i don't know you're kind of a waste if you think about it dude man if you  think about maybe today's not the day to talk about but uh there there's some scams going on in 
[00:40:30]  that fucking world oh yeah yeah please they just like any other business this is my guess look at  the fucking cover that's cool as shit the cover is patrice o'neill it's called mr p like i said because  that's what his stepdaughter who's only 11 by the way and i'm i'm hearing already has like patrice's  inquisitive uh mind oh yeah asking a lot of questions all the time which is kind of cool  uh because they weren't blood related but she fucking picked up on you know what he was all 
[00:41:00]  about that's what i'm hearing i've only met her a couple times and just kept it very simple but yeah  uh the picture is patrice fucking decked out like a mac daddy and uh he's looking at his watch and  behind him is like new york city just zooming by blurred out yeah it's got motion blur explain it  motion blur thank you man yeah is that time square yeah yeah yeah that's a solid fucking cover  and colin quinn wrote the liner notes and that'll just bring you to fucking tears too  colin quinn did an amazing job on the liner notes yeah colin's the shit um uh oh yeah 
[00:41:30]  i i i'm convinced that the funeral homes yeah have deals with the with the uh the flower shops oh  yeah because everyone like gets flower sent they're only there for a day maybe two they're  freshish fresh as all hell by the time everyone marches out of the funeral home yeah they're not  throwing those things away so you think they send them back to the flower shop for a kickback and then  they sell them again absolutely wow the flower shop now comes back in that's a hell of an accusation 
[00:42:00]  you're making mr and goes here here's well i'm not talking about a funeral home in in particular right  why wouldn't you yeah because the family's the family is gone and now you got all the all these  fresh flowers yeah and then i'm thinking the the flower shop comes back in fucking makes a little  deal like i'll give you a whatever amount of money to just take all this out and then they go back to  the flower shop and pick through it and see what they could you know keep true and no one would know 
[00:42:30]  no although somebody probably would have looked into that by now if it was happening you think if  these dopes want to look into something i would i would fucking get a camera crew back door funeral  home a shame shame shame segment late night where they they chase them with the camera hey are you  reselling flowers and then also the van with joe's flower shop appears yeah oh fuck yeah i guarantee  there's at least one funeral home out there doing that canary going on and then they try to convince 
[00:43:00]  you when someone's cremated yeah that you have to buy a uh a coffin by the way this is just from  past experience i swear um and they say and you'll go well why do we need a coffin if uh he's being  cremated you know because the presentation looks good you gotta have a nice coffin and they're like  and besides we're gonna you know cremate the coffin along with the person bullshit you think they just  that's another deal that goes down yeah resell it back to the yes i wouldn't be surprised if your 
[00:43:30]  loved one has has been you know a few of you they've been laying in some fucking used coffins you are  making some accusations there's at least one out there yeah i didn't name a funeral home that's where  you would get in trouble with this shit it's just my thoughts and and talking to people over the years  because they're business people too they don't give a fuck i'll name one yeah ted's funeral emporium  i bet uh opie's wrong flowers are saved in the funeral home and taken to the grave with the person 
[00:44:00]  no man i've been to an i've been to enough unfortunate unfortunately grave sites where  maybe they take a few flowers not the whole fucking thing yeah they'll put a bunch on the casket yeah  you haven't been to these wakes where it's like wall-to-wall flowers you're trying to tell me  they bring all those to the fucking cemetery not the ones i've been to oh well it's a florist oh boy  all right uh marcos you marcos you lose today here's nick in new jersey i knew someone would call 
[00:44:30]  nick go ahead don't mention don't mention uh all right go ahead well i mentioned it all right  first of all when you go when you have a funeral they charge you to take those flowers to the cemetery  so most people don't take all the flowers to the cemetery they take a few right because they charge  you yeah i've seen i've seen the take a few and so uh at my grandma's funeral they gave us all a rose  yeah and then you know we put the rose on the casket which i was like this is the dumbest fucking 
[00:45:00]  thing okay well that's a separate deal with the florist they supply the roses too okay gotcha  i get into work about 7 a.m about 8 we get a call two funeral homes in the area we worked in an area  where there was like seven or eight funeral homes within about 10 miles right so two funeral homes  in the area need you there before 9 30 to pick up flowers i would go and those full tripod stands of  flowers i'd pick up like nine of them then then a couple of baskets and then we take them back to the 
[00:45:30]  funeral home and the i mean the florist and then the owner and the the manager who was the same  family would pick through them for good flowers good vases and the stands forget it the stands are  premium those metal stands yeah florist never uses a new metal stand so if they charge you for one  they're robbing you because they get them back from the from every funeral home wow but is the funeral  home giving you are you giving the funeral home money to take the flowers out there yeah 
[00:46:00]  there's some there's some monetary deals we had a couple of monetary deals with some of them  others would just take anytime they called up for family things like oh my wife needs roses and stuff  they get them for free and then there'd be whenever somebody came in for flowers  we would recommend certain funeral homes so there's money there's kickbacks or there's just plain 
[00:46:30]  recommendation and plugs wow but it was dude i i did this for 25 years as a second job  and i want to tell you i'm talking about in the floral business almost everything is recyclable  everything i told you you had to think yeah because the beauty of it is you send flowers you know which  is the right thing to do it you know whatever because people want to do something i i personally think  you should try to find a charity or something whatever but uh they're sitting there all nice  and fresh i'm like no one's grabbing their flowers after this whole thing's done you leave the you can't 
[00:47:00]  wait to get the fuck out of the funeral home right you can't wait and you don't even want to be a mile  from the damn thing so it's completely safe for now the the florist to come in and grab you know their  flowers back guys i pulled up in the event one time we had to go with three of our vans but i pulled up  with a van while the family was still pulling out in the funeral procession like they're pulling up 
[00:47:30]  creating a vacuum and i'm pulling in behind them and the doors open and the spanish kids that worked  with me would jump out and we would be in this funeral room and we'd be pulling flowers out  and it was it's almost like that disney world thing where they spray it down and then they do it  again yeah yeah my uh when my grandma died you know she was living in the uh this uh this facility  at the end of her life there and we uh a bunch of us you know me and a few of my cousins we decided 
[00:48:00]  i didn't know about the scam back then i was suspicious but we were able to grab a bunch of them  and bring it to where she used to you know live and kind of you know give it to some of the  residents there and the staff oh but here's some death flowers what are you gonna do with them you  know you could always beat them like that because you know there are you know those those women will  go oh i'm gonna take this home and put this on my table and the floor uh the funeral home won't try 
[00:48:30]  to stop you right if you want to take flowers and you're a family member yeah but most don't take them  because they they almost feel like that's morbid you know what i mean right and you don't want to  bring them to your own house because you're like oh my god these flowers were were for my uncle  i don't want them in my house i'm glad i could shed some light on that boys you have a great day  thank you sir all right uh wow pat duffy's father on the line what hey boys mr duffy used to be a florist 
[00:49:00]  well remember crosses the wife oh right right right i forgot everything that guy just said is true  let's see yeah i we we even used to dabble in uh the wedding receptions too with the centerpieces  and stuff for the baskets and the balls dabble he was dabble i love the word dabble yeah well  the biggest thing though like he said is the stand-up racks for the wreaths and all that stuff 
[00:49:30]  at the funeral yeah i mean we we had we had guys who worked in cemeteries bringing them over dropping  them off oh they called me up and i'd go in my pickup truck and pick them up see and and the plastic  baskets i mean they were unbelievable if you bought them brandy new you know and there was money being  exchanged right uh it was yeah like around valentine's day you know we'd make a deal you know that kind  of stuff yeah you know valentine's day that's another ripoff but that's beside the point 
[00:50:00]  but how do you dabble how do you dabble in valentine's day because those flowers usually the women want  to keep yeah but we buy no no i mean the prices oh yeah of course oh yeah we used to reserve  flowers three months out and you got them at that price and they would deliver to them on that price  you know that day right you know three days whatever you know that that was always a rip off whatever  hey were you proud of your son when he was chugging the uh mashed potato puke at the live broadcast 
[00:50:30]  for your 60th birthday well facebook and uh relatives are still uh sending nice kid nice kid  nice he's a great kid we love pat oh yeah so do i all right sir thank you have a good day you too  he's laughing he sounds like a lunatic yeah you know where pat got it yeah totally uh 
[00:51:00]  coffins are reused for cremation since they aren't burned yeah that but they'll tell you they're burning  the coffin and that's why you know you got to buy one and blah blah but now i'm learning you can rent  them oh yeah for eight to nine hundred bucks you could rent a coffin  morbid uh i work at a funeral home we used to call a church and they would take them and donate  them to old age homes and whatnot so there you go i mean there's a guy kind of doing the right thing  yeah i don't think every funeral home's like that why not might as well right you might as well 
[00:51:30]  all right all right you want to break yeah we'll break it into some things oh the saga of uh angel  adams yes we will do this next what is that the saga of angel adams that fucking bitch does it bother  you it really bothers me when i just makes me laugh last night no because because that is just a

Instead of  Like, I tried to tell people yesterday  It's not like a best-of show  We basically are  We did it like  When they do pop-up channels  Like when they did the  Charlie Sheen channel  Or whatever dopey channels they do  We're turning it  There's a lot of dopey channels 
[01:02:30]  Oh, there's a lot of dopey channels  But we're turning it  A lot of them  We're turning it  You wanna name a few, Sam?  I don't, but  Of course you don't  I will sit here while you do  Gleefully  Gleefully  I think they had a Glee channel  Now that I think about it  But we're turning  It's gonna be  It's a Patrice channel  All week  All Saturday  All weekend long  Right  From 6 a.m. Saturday  Till 6 a.m. Monday  Right  It's just  A Patrice channel  So don't  You know  And it's not a best-of  I said 
[01:03:00]  Cause we all record  A little something  I said it's a taste  It's just a taste  Yeah  You can't  You can't  You can't really pick  The best bits  I guess you can  Technically  We could  We could do a month  Of Takeover channel  With him  Easily  Fucking easily  Yeah  Fucking easily  Fuck  All right  We were gonna get  To that annoying  Oh yeah  The saga  Of Angel Adams  What do you got  On this egg  Brittany did  Fit a lot of shit 
[01:03:30]  In like 10 years  From the time she was  20 till now  Yeah  It's a lot of drama  A lot of sexy  Holy mother of  Fuck  That picture looks good  Yeah  There's a bunch of them  That look really good  God damn  Boy she had a short  Shelf life though  What do you mean  As far as like  You know  She was good from  Oh god  I know  Fuck  You forget how  Insanely hot she was  That's why  It's sad  Wow  Wee  Kazowie  Look at that ass 
[01:04:00]  Yeah  It's not sad  That she's 30  It's that  She's 30  Reminds you  Of how  She just never  Really took care of herself  How incredibly hot  She was when she  First hit the scene  Right  Yeah  We used to have  Our little posters  Up in her office  At N.E.W.  That used to creep people out  Because she was  I don't know  Maybe 16  17 at the time  Yeah  Yeah  See  You know  You can't get on people  When you  Think a 16 year old  Is hot 
[01:04:30]  Because  You know  In a couple of years  They're 18  And then they're smoking  By the way  The Britney Spears  No no  Listen Sam  Sam  Let me explain  A little something  Don't judge  I had the Britney Spears poster  Above where I sat  Anthony had  Yes  Which made my poster  Make complete sense  He had a picture  Of the Olsen twins  Yeah  When they were hot  And the Olsen twins  Are what  Not even 25 today  Really  I don't think so  I think they're 30 
[01:05:00]  No  No  They're younger than  Britney Spears  And he had  He had Olsen twins  Above his area  His work area  Those are children  Well yeah  Olsen twins  Just look like  Fucking  Hell in a handbag  Now  We had that bit  We couldn't wait  For them to be legal  Yeah  Then they turned legal  And they just  What a disappointment  They suck  Olsen twins suck  They just look like  Little fucking alien things  Yeah they suck  And they're billionaires too  They're so weird looking  They really are right  They're odd 
[01:05:30]  Mmhmm  Odd  Alright let's do this  We got the saga  Of Angel Adams  Angel Adams  How about Ansel Adams  Wasn't he a photographer  I used to be a big  Ansel Adams fan  Were you?  Yeah  What happened?  When you  When you went  Are you still?  I'll tell you  I'll tell you what happened  It's Ansel  I'm surprised  Shut up  He's got one of them  But when they're four  Tops  I'm surprised  This has never come up  On the show before  I  When I was starting  To get into photography 
[01:06:00]  And art in general  Yeah I was a big  Ansel Adams fan  Yeah  Until I went into  Every single person's  Fucking apartment  And they had an  Ansel Adams  On the wall  Oh yeah  Kind of ruined it  Everyone went  Ansel Adams  Everyone  Everyone  And I kind of just  Got rid of my  Ansel Adams  But when I see him  Online  The pictures and stuff  I always check him out  Yeah  Boy it must have  Sucked lugging that  Big camera up to  Those like  Fucking cliffs 
[01:06:30]  Cliffs and  Mountaintops  Yeah he's like  Out on a ledge  Yeah  He's out on a  Fucking ledge  Like ready to fall  And who was taking  His picture  Of him taking a picture  That's a good question  Cause that's like  The guy  And that guy  Should be famous  Yeah  I don't know  Bear Grylls  Bear Grylls  You think of  Bear Grylls  Great grandfather  Do you like photography  I do yeah  You do like what though  I don't know  I'm not into like  Abstracty stupid things  Nah I fucking hate that shit  I like a good landscape 
[01:07:00]  You do  Yeah I like a good landscape  I like  I like roads  And paths  Roads and paths  Yep  A path in the woods  You like a good picture  Of a path  I bought  I bought a  Yeah I bought something  Basically like that  Like a little  A lane  They call that  A lane  I don't know why  I don't know what that  Represents  But I'm sure  Some sick fuck  Will turn into  A molestation story  Oh I'm sure  That's what we have to do  On this show  Every fucking day 
[01:07:30]  It represents  The bunghole  Right  But maybe  Maybe it just represents  Something very fucking  Spiritual and cool  Instead  Instead of a fucking  Finger in my hiney hole  Sometimes you can just  Enjoy  Jesus  Thank you  Thank you for having  Logic today  Yeah  I think it represents  Not everything goes back  To molestation  The path where you had  To run away from the guy  Who was molestation  Exactly  Exactly  He was chasing me  In the woods  Exactly  That's the pleasant  Path not taken  Yeah  See that's the  Oh please  You were somewhere  In the woods  Being molested 
[01:08:00]  You know what that is  It's the old dirt road  Opie  It's going up  The old dirt road  I actually searched it out  Here in Manhattan  It's like  It was like  My buddy Fred  Name's Fred  Finally grabbed it  It's in his house now  But it was probably  Four feet across  Yeah  Two feet  Is this about  Two feet maybe  Yeah  Yeah  A little more  Two feet up  Like this  Four feet across  Like this  Like this  This  Like this  How much is that 
[01:08:30]  Almost three right  Oh that's three feet  Alright so it was  Three feet high  And then maybe  Five feet across  It was all green  A green  And then a path  In the middle of it  Ah  That's sexual right there  Well I used to like  Mountain biking  And I used to like  I was a big time runner  And so you would find  A lot of paths  To do all that shit on  So I don't know  Maybe it brings me  Back to that time  I think this time  Well that's a bunghole picture  That represents the Cooley hole  Yeah of course  That's the hiney right there  It's a wooden walkway  Where the duty comes out  Yeah  Going into like a 
[01:09:00]  Tree covered  Canopy  Kind of  Trail  And it does look like  The bung  The bung  The bung  A fucking can  Taki shoot  Turn me on to  A guy that just  Posts great pictures  He does  And here's an asshole  I like photography as well  Pictures of big titties  Spread vaginal lips  And gaping assholes  Nice  You're a gaping asshole  Yes  I like Girls Daily  I go there as well 
[01:09:30]  So relax  Oh yeah  That's  That's a good  I know there's  Other people trying to do that  That's a good one  He knows what the fuck  She's doing  If it's a she  If it's a she  If it's a she  I don't know  I like to think  That that's a she  I talk to that person  Every once in a while  But I don't know  If it's a she  A fucking he  A she he  I have no idea  I think it's a lesbian  Yeah  But for some reason  She doesn't want to be on the show  Which makes me suspicious  That it might be a guy  Make him believe  It's a she  Yeah  Because it's a lot more  It's not as creepy  When it's just a girl  Posting like nude pics 
[01:10:00]  Of girls  And because of  Because of  I would have to say  Because of me  Yeah  I didn't want her to go  Hardcore with her photos  So now she's got another  Account that's hardcore photos  Brilliant  Oh  So you keep it where  It's like the  Kind of average girl  I like that  You know  Just showing off some shit  Yep  And then if you need  More than that  Now she's got the hardcore site  Those are the ones  I like  The regular  The regular everyday girl  Yes  I don't like them  Stripper looking  Who is  Yes  So what kind of 
[01:10:30]  What kind of  Photography you like  Well yeah  Good landscape  What else  Do you like  Pictures of very  Famous places  I don't  It doesn't have to be  No  No  Oh god  Earl Douglas'  Photo  Thank you Sam  He's pulling up  Earl's photography  Photography  By Douglas  You know what  He's not  He's not that bad man  Well how hard  He gets a little 
[01:11:00]  He doesn't point your camera  But he kind of  Overthinks some stuff  Sometimes when he shoots  But he's not that bad  I've seen great pictures  Taken with the iPhone  I mean  You know  Well the Instagram  Has really helped  Everybody along right  Is this  Why does Earl  Just take pictures  Of black people  Oh is this the  Black Rock Coalition book  Oh no he's doing  He walks around New York  Now and just takes pictures  Of white people too  Mostly buildings  And then maybe a tree  In the middle  You know  That's in the way  Of the building  And that represents 
[01:11:30]  Something  He's trying to be artistic  Oh yeah  Yeah he's trying  You could make it look  Like you're being artistic  Without knowing anything  About photography  You just gotta do that  Yeah put something  In the foreground  Yeah  Just click it  Yeah  It's like oh it's a leaf  Yeah  Or that  He had a picture  Shot of the corner  Of a building  Where you  You almost lay down  Oh yeah  Put the camera right  At the corner of a building  And shoot  Straight up  Straight up  It's like really  That's been done  A thousand fucking times  It's Earl Douglas  What is it  Eve Douglas  Five  Two eight 
[01:12:00]  Picture of the  Two eight  The love  Thing  And everyone thinks  They're the only ones  Taking that picture  Yeah  No Earl  The last picture  It was a skyscraper  And then a tree  Without its leaves  And that was in front  Of the skyscraper  And the skyscraper  Was in the background  Well that sounds grand  There it is  Yeah  Like anyone  Alright look  Anyone can take that  What is he trying to say there  It's just  Because he's trying  To say something  Yeah  That's not like  Oh this looks cool 
[01:12:30]  He's trying to  Represents something  In that shot  Things that move  Faster than Earl  A tree  And a building  Hey  Oh that's pleasant  What is that  What is that  Trees  He likes those trees  Huh  He certainly does  With the crooked  Fucking arms  Crooked branches  Well they look like arms  They certainly do  I think that's what  He's going for  Oh Earl  Like it's an octopus  Octopus out of water 
[01:13:00]  Alright let's  Do some  Angel Adams  I heard about  Angel Adams  And I did not  I did not look  At the video  It's infuriating  She has a lot of kids  And she wants what  Fifteen kids  That she had  Fifteen kids  That she had  Wow  Fifteen kids  With different daddies  Of course  She's 37  So she's had time  To have 15 kids  She's had 15 kids  And she's only 37  Each kid takes about a year  Twelve  Twelve of the kids 
[01:13:30]  Are minors  Not minors  Minors  And  Her husband  Boyfriend  Fiance  Whatever it was  Fiance I think  Which means  Baby daddy  Is now in prison  Go figure that out  Right  And she now  Is demanding  That  Someone  Pay for her  And her children  Really  To live  And eat  And be clothed  And she  Is so adamant  That she  For some reason 
[01:14:00]  Deserves  To have people  Pay for her  And there's not  A hint of humility  Or embarrassment  Or anything  She demands  She's demanding  That people  Take care of her  And her chidgens  Is she  On the welfare  The food stamps  She's on  All kinds of stuff  So she's already  Getting help  But not enough  But not enough  Not enough  It's not enough  Why did she  Have 15 kids  Exactly  Because she  Can't keep  Her fucking  Cunts shut  My mom 
[01:14:30]  Once bitched  That you know  She had  Five births  I guess  Right  Five  Because I have  Twins in my family  Oh  Yeah so she  Was pregnant  Five times  And had six kids  And she  She openly  Admitted  The reason why  She had so many  Kids was because  Of the church  Really  No birth control  No she was old school  No birth control  Because you go to hell  And burn for eternity  And all that shit  So then she  Went to the church  You know  It's well documented  That we went through 
[01:15:00]  Some very poor stages  In our lives  Yeah  And then also my dad  Had money  It was the weirdest  Fucking thing  But she went to the church  Looking for help  Like hey man  The only reason I had  Six kids  Oh man  Was because you know  I'm following the faith  Right  And then they pretty much  Shut the door in her face  And said good luck to you  You know  Maybe we can get you  A few hand-me-down  Fucking pairs of pants  Or something  Yeah  That's about all  We can do for you  Well I don't think  This broad here  Is doing it for the church  Because she's got  Different daddies  She's not married  Right  And I think she just 
[01:15:30]  Liked the feeling  Of black cock in her  Yeah  But I always liked  The logic that  You know  That was some good logic  From my mom  Yeah yeah  If you asked her  She probably would have  Had three or four  Not six  You know  Maybe four  Maybe  Because she knew  You know  You shouldn't have  A lot of kids  If you can't afford them  Well true  You know  That's just being smart  About it  Well this woman  Has no clue  Okay  And like I said  No humility  Are we playing from there  No  Because this is a  Ten minute clip  Oh fuck that 
[01:16:00]  We got some highlights  Here's the first highlight  In my case  They haven't been in my life  Six months  And I'm homeless  37 year old  Angel Adams  Blames the system  For her problems  A system of  Social service agencies  Trying to help her  Adams has 15 children  12 who are now  Living with her  In this small motel room  While we were in the room  The children  Had no food available  No shoes  And Adams says  They haven't had a change  Of clothes  In more than three days  Landlords  Recently evicted Adams 
[01:16:30]  And her children  From this Tampa apartment  After discovering  She was living there  With her 12 children  The kids clothes  Books  Toys  And furniture  Are now out on the curb  Picked over by scavengers  The building's owners say  They gave ample warning  To Adams  Warnings  They say  She chose to ignore  We tried to help them  And  And  I think several  Other agencies  You know  With paying of her rent  And the paying of her  Utilities and stuff  You know  Did more than their part 
[01:17:00]  I'm with you  Oh god  No problem here  I'm infuriating  And that isn't even  The most infuriating clip  Yeah I know  Yeah  People ask  What has changed  You know  When I became a father  These type of stories  Fucking just drive you insane  I can't imagine  That a kid's not being  Taken care of  I can't fucking fathom it  They haven't even had  A change of clothes  In days  No food  That place must stink  Holy shit  Can't they just  Take the kids  From this woman  And give these kids 
[01:17:30]  A shot  Well  Maybe  Alright  Angel wants to know  Who's gonna pay  Yeah  But Adam says  Her life didn't start  To fall apart  Until social service  Agency's got involved  Really  Her fiance  Gary Brown Sr  The man who fathered  10 of her 15 children  Was arrested  And Adam says  She was left with nothing  I don't have any clothes  People have been  Donating food  Just around here  Just helping me out  With food 
[01:18:00]  And I don't have anything  We called the  Department of Children  And Families  To see what they've  Been doing to help  DCF says  Hillsborough Kids Incorporated  Has been helping  By paying Adam's rent  Even providing her furniture  Adam says  It isn't enough  Somebody  Needs to pay  For all my children  And my  And Gary  All our suffering  All our pain  Somebody needs to be  Held accountable  And they need to pay  You should be  Held accountable  Can you  Fuck it 
[01:18:30]  You fucking had  15 kids  That tipped me off  In my house last night  Because I saw the link  I clicked on it  It was tweeted  And I started watching it  And when that part  Came on  I was alone  In my house  Yelling  Yelling the N-bomb  Like a fucking madman  Calling her  The worst possible things  Oh I  Oh it's fantastic  That's  Again my neighbor's like  Oh boy  That's lunacy  Man  What's the logic  Of having 15 kids 
[01:19:00]  There is no logic  To it  She was  She's a fucking  Whore  A leech  A burden  To society  Holy shit  And again  Do you see how  There's just no  There's no accountability  There's no humility  There's no embarrassment  She's just like  Someone needs to pay  Someone needs to pay  For my suffering  And my chidgens  Well the word that got me  Was accountability  Yeah yeah  You're the one that  Got yourself into this  Yeah  Close your fucking 
[01:19:30]  Smelly snatch  Yes Sam  No no no  Sam  You raised your mic  Oh shit  That means you're ready to talk  Well I can talk if you want  I just didn't want to interrupt  It's not  You raised your mic  Watch this  I got something to add  Okay  Who gives a fuck  Days later  Angel goes to court  And is put in jail  For contempt  Really  Oh yeah  What's this about  Why did she have to go to court  It didn't say in the news story  Why she was going to court  I'm assuming  That it's not a terribly 
[01:20:00]  Uncommon occurrence  For her to be in court  It's not like  A crazy thing  That she was in court  Right  Please  Please  If there is a God  This ends with the kids  Being taken away from her  Please  Please oh please oh please  Give these kids a fucking chance  She doesn't strike me as somebody  Who exudes personal responsibility  These kids don't have a chance  It's over Johnny  Well  How young are they  There's enough of them  How young are they  If they're young enough  They could have a chance  They're literally ranging  From two 
[01:20:30]  To  Out of the house  You know  Probably 20 years old  Oh yeah  Those guys are fucked  But maybe the youngins  Really  Maybe we could save  A few of the youngins  In a foster home  With a daddy in prison  And a fucking whore mother  That doesn't take care  They're just fucked up  DCF regional director  Nick Cox stepped in  And moved Angel  And her children  To a kid's place  In Brandon  As a temporary home  But Angel  Remained defiant  In court last week  Hillsborough County Judge  Tracy Sheehan  Asked Angel  A pointed question 
[01:21:00]  At a status hearing  Are you pregnant?  Sheehan demanded to know  Because she was concerned  Adams had been with a man  In front of the children  At the motel room  Or in a small  Two bedroom apartment  She had lived in  Before being evicted  Take her away deputies  When Adams refused  To answer  Sheehan sent her  To jail  For contempt of court  She might be pregnant  That was the thing  Yeah  They asked if she was pregnant  Because then there was  There was some kind of  A deal where they  They thought she might have  Had some sexual activity 
[01:21:30]  In front of the children  Oh my god  And they asked her  If she was pregnant  And she wouldn't answer  The question  So uh  Because they're all living  In one tiny little room  Yeah  So that means she would  Be having sex  In front of  Right  What a piece of garbage  She is a waste  Of life  What a piece of garbage  Jay black guy  Cleveland  I say black guy  Because it's important  To the discussion  I guess Jay  Because I don't give a fuck  Go ahead Jay  Alright man  And usually  Most of the time  Every time you call 
[01:22:00]  Black people niggas  And shit  I don't agree with you  But this time  This bitch is a nigga  See when I said  N word  I said  I meant nice  Oh  You misunderstood  Oh  You misunderstood me  But I hate this  This is the type of person  That draws us down  As a people  And we should be  Fucking separating  Ourselves from them  And where the fuck  Is Reverend Al  Yelling at this hoe  You're not doing anything  Exactly  He's too busy  Eating his mama's

[01:27:00]  We'll function  Just fine  They're keeping  The white man down  They certainly are  So let's get back  To Angel Adams  Last we left you  She was being  Arrested in court  Because she didn't  Behave in fucking court  Yeah  She wouldn't answer  The judge's question  About whether or not  She was pregnant  If she was pregnant  And was impregnated  In front of her  Small children  Why would you get  Preganed so many times  What is that about  She's a mental patient  Angel apologizes  For her behavior  To the judge 
[01:27:30]  Today  At yet another hearing  Sheehan  Released Adams  From jail  I called  In everyone  To say  I have no interest  In leaving her  In jail  Because I think  To do so  Just burdens  The taxpayers  Of Hillsborough County  Even further  Then DCF  Regional Director  Nick Cox  Updated the court  On the children  They appear to be  Doing very well  And finally  Angel Adams spoke  Surprising everyone  To your question  Of me being pregnant  No I am not pregnant  And no my children  Have not been around 
[01:28:00]  Any men  Outside of  Their father  Adams went even further  Apologizing to the court  And to DCF  And I do want to  Apologize to you  And say I'm sorry  To everybody in the room  You know  I understand  That these people  Have went out  Of their way  To get a house  For me and my children  The children remain  In state custody  DCF is working  With family members  To place the children

[01:30:30]  We saw Angel Adams  She was getting out  Of jail on contempt  Charge  Judge releasing her  Because all 12  Of her minor children  Are now in  Protective custody  And now more trouble  Only a day after  Adams released from jail  Police had to be called  Deputy say Adams  And her sister  In front of the children  Became profane  And abusive  With shelter workers  Court papers say  Adams got angry  When a social worker  Referred to herself  As the children's  House mother  The judge  Repeated Adams  Word 
[01:31:00]  Quote she ate  Your mama  And who the  Do you think  You are having  Them call you mama  Is that what  She said  My client  Denies saying it  Were people cursing  In front of the kids  Well it was back and forth  Yes sir  Yes ma'am  Then in front of a  Small army of social workers  And lawyers  Adams hedged on visiting  The kids  In front of a psychiatrist  Your honor  Your honor  My client's just concerned  That the more  That she does  The more the department  Wants her to 
[01:31:30]  To do  In order to get  Her children back  You know  It's always one more thing  Ms. Adams  It's not like  Let's make a deal  Over here  You don't want to visit  With our rules  You don't visit  And deputies say  Adams has been banned  From the shelter  Where her children  Are staying  They say she and her sister  Threatened to harm  The social workers  Who are caring for them  That's good  That's good  You're starting  This whole fucking mess  Is she a drug addict?  Boy they didn't bring that up  Doesn't seem like it  Right?  No she doesn't seem 
[01:32:00]  She just seems like a  I would assume  She's mentally ill  Yeah there's some kind of  There's some kind of  Problem there  That makes her  Get a jism  In her vagina  And have children  Look at what a  Jamoke her lawyer is  I know  A Jamoke  That's the first thing  I thought of  He's one of those guys  Jamoke  He's one of those guys  That would sit in a hot tub  Looking like a dummy  Looking like a dummy  One of my favorite things  Like when Biggie was just rapping  He was just a dummy

I don't think so  No  Cause you know  The Nagel seed is very valuable  Oh yeah  I would like to know  How close  He's probably terrified  With this story  Of course he is  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  The Nagel seed  Prince Nagel  It's royalty  It's Floridian royalty  It's Floridian gold  In that condom 
[01:33:00]  They call it Floridian gold  Yes  Florida's main exports  Are oranges  And Nagel semen  And we all know that  You know  Born and raised in Florida  So  Yeah from day one  It's more valuable than gold  In Florida  People are selling it  Yeah  Let's go to Holly man  Hey guys  Are you Holly St. Pete  On Twitter  Yes  See I fucking pay attention  Out there  Wow  What's going on Holly  Well listen  Well obviously I live in Tampa  And this story is really old 
[01:33:30]  And I don't understand  Why it's coming back around  Oh is it  It's from April 2010  Well it's been  It hit the old internet  And went kind of viral this week  So I don't know why it's out there  So what happened in the year since  Is she all respectable  And earning her own keep  And raising her kids  College tuitions  I totally forgot about it  Until you guys brought it up  But the reason why she  Lost her house  Was her boyfriend  Who actually is father to  Quite a few of the children  Yeah 10  They were in section 8 housing 
[01:34:00]  Obviously  And he was selling cocaine  To pay the rent  And he got arrested  All right  Sure you're going to get that paper  He got arrested  For selling cocaine  And then they were not able to  Pay the rent anymore  Because there wasn't a  You know  Wage earner in the house  Burden gotta eat  And  It was just a nightmare  I don't know  Whatever happened to those kids  Of course they never  Talk about it anymore  They just drop it  And it goes away  Right  But they ended up 
[01:34:30]  That she was behind  On the rent  You know  And they paid the  Tampa Housing Authority  That's where the rent went to  And they ended up  Paying the $6,000  In back rent  That she owed  For what  Why  Because she was  Such a pain in the ass  She was on the news  Every day  She was in court  Freaking out  Screaming at the judge  And the whole nine yards  And she was just  A whack-a-doodle  Well language  It's appropriate though  In this case  Yes a whack-a-doodle  But anyways

[01:49:30]  Of  Not even the best  Of Patrice  Just like  All  I mean it was just  Too much to fit in  Even to 16 hours  Yeah that's why I said  It's a taste  We could do a whole week  Easily  I mean in the coming months  And certainly in the next year  You'll hear a lot of Patrice  On this channel  A lot of stuff  That's favorites to everybody  Some stuff that I had  No idea that we even  Talked about  Is in there  A bunch of people  Did little testimonials  And shared some memories  Of Patrice 
[01:50:00]  It was done really well  And you told me last night  You got a hold of Warren Haynes  Yes  Warren Haynes was on a bus  To Boston  And he remembers the day  That Patrice sang with him  And what did you tell me  Warren Haynes even thought  It was weird  He picked that song out  Yeah  And especially once  He heard that he  Had passed  And he was thinking back  On that  And he's just like  That is just  It was really fucked up  That that was the song  He picked  Like he was predicting  That he was gonna go  Right  Did you get him to record 
[01:50:30]  Anything or no  Yeah  Warren Haynes  That's awesome  We should play the original  By Howling Wolf  It's the song  Patrice sang on our show  Last May  Yeah  You could get it on YouTube  Because I checked it out  And you could tell  That Patrice knew the song  Really well  Because he sang it  Pretty close to the original  So  It starts what  Tomorrow morning  Tomorrow morning  At 6am  Okay  And it'll run all weekend  Until 6am  Monday morning  Yeah  And it's 16 hours  Of material  Played what  Three different times  I guess  Is what it comes down to  Yeah  More or less  It's three times  There's a lot of good stuff in there

[02:23:00]  T-G-I-F, I say.  It's going to be a long weekend.  T-G-I-F, I'm going to enjoy it, I hope.  Yeah.  Knock wood.  I'm just going to, who am I kidding?  I'm going to play Xbox.  Are you going to partay?  I'm going to play some Call of Duty.  I was on that last night.  Yeah.  People are dumb.  Why?  Because I give out my gamer tag every so often.  And I've played online with listeners and stuff when Danny's playing or Bobby and shit 
[02:23:30]  like that and getting a group and stuff.  But don't fucking, one guy was like, you know how the bloop little thing comes up in the  corner that says, you know, somebody has a message for you or something.  There's people that's like, uh, this gamer tag, you know, wants to chat with you.  I'm playing a fucking game.  I'm not, I'm not, I don't want to chat with the fucking listeners.  Or, uh, you know, this one wants, you know, you to join a game or be a friend.  I'm not friending anybody. 
[02:24:00]  I'm, I'm, I'm all full up with friends.  You don't want gamer friends.  I got plenty of them.  I got like that, like Coke logic is in there and shit.  And I've never checked mine.  Really?  Yeah.  I got plenty of, uh, of gamer friends.  I'm not on enough, but PS3.  And I guess I got a lot of friends.  Got a lot of the friends.  But I don't know what that really means.  Yeah.  It's just people that will annoy you and bug you while you're trying to play a game.  When people come over your house, you hide, you pretend your games are only one player. 
[02:24:30]  So I don't pretend.  I have one controller.  So you probably aren't going to do a lot of online playing.  I have one controller.  I'm not pretending.  I never bought a second controller.  Yeah.  But isn't, because I only play right now.  I only play Tiger Woods.  I like my golf games.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I want people to, if they really know what they're doing, I'll fucking play them.  Because it's fun.  But I can't sit through like, how does this work?  Like, what do you do?  Oh, that is infuriating.  They're getting 18s on holes and I just want to like, you know, fucking play.  Yeah. 
[02:25:00]  There's no fun in it for me.  I like when people are bad at video games because I'm not good.  Oh, really?  So if they don't know how to play at all, that's the only time I win.  But I, yeah.  But I also, but I'm also like, I understand it the other way too.  I suck at like John Madden and they were playing a lot of John Madden this past Thanksgiving.  I didn't step in because I could tell they were really into it.  And I wasn't going to be like, well, how do you fuck it?  No.  How do you throw?  You don't want to be that person.  No.  Do you run here?  Do you run here?  Yeah.  I read the room and I realized like my nephews and a few other people were really into playing 
[02:25:30]  each other.  I'm like, okay, there's no way they want me in on this.  Yeah.  You know, I knew.  And you know, yeah, you know that.  You're not just going to try to jump in.  Oh my God.  They can't get enough of the old guys beating the shit out of each other.  The fighting old.  That video is still all over TV.  Old codgers.  Fucking Newt, huh?  Newt Gingrich.  He's at the, he's at the forefront right now.  He seems to have a little more steam than these other, the past Republican front runners 
[02:26:00]  in the primaries here.  Yeah.  I like, and as soon as I say this, people are going to fuck, they're going to attack  me.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  This is, I like his honesty, man.  And then people are like, well, actually he's not really honest.  He's not a liar.  He's not a liar.  He's not a liar.  He's not a liar.  He's not a liar.  He's not a liar.  How can he say that?  Look at his record.  Honesty.  You're a dick.  Right.  I like how he's just kind of taking everyone to task, as they say.  He tasks me and I shall have him for it.  Yeah.  He's pretty, he's pretty blunt. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  And this Herman Cain, let's, let's all be honest.  This guy's a pathological liar.  Pathological liar.  It's fucking creepy.  It really is scary.  Look, I don't know, I don't know shit, but I would bet a lot of money he had a 13 year  affair with this woman.  Oh yeah.  And he's like, how he explains shit on TV with all the cameras rolling.  I'm like, holy fuck, this guy's a pathological liar.  He really tries to lie about it, but leave a little bit of plausible deniability, which 
[02:27:00]  just makes him look bad.  Right.  Why would they, why would they feel like they have to attack his character?  There was no way he was ever going to be present.  He was fun to watch and stuff.  And if they wanted to go after him, they would probably go after some business ethics, maybe.  Yeah.  Which is a little easier than like convincing women to come out of nowhere to say they had  sex with him.  To have so many come forward and he's got an excuse for every single one of them.  It's just.  Who was calling him out?  And he goes, uh, I, I, I'm not going to be a detective here. 
[02:27:30]  Was that Jon Stewart?  A detective.  It was a clip that hit the, hit, uh, all over the place this morning.  I'm not going to be a detective.  Cause they're like, well, isn't there a, oh, is that, I, was it Sean Hannity?  It might've been a Sean Hannity clip.  Sean.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sean Hannity.  You got that clip?  I'm looking for the clip itself.  And then you listen, you're like, holy fuck.  I think he believes this shit, even though it's not real.  That's just it.  He really, which is the definition of a pathological liar, right?  You almost start believing your own lies.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Isn't that true?  Yes. 
[02:28:00]  Then how do you, how do you know, like you're not a pathological liar?  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  If you believe it, maybe you're just lying all the time and people are calling you a  liar.  We all could be a pathological liar if you think you truly believe it.  Oh shit.  Is this the clip?  It's the whole interview.  Oh Jesus.  How long is that?  17 and a half minutes.  Perfect.  All right.  Let's just play it.  Perfect.  We are the worst.  Perfect.  Let it roll. 
[02:28:30]  I don't know.  Well, Newt, honesty.  Okay.  But I mean, he, he's taking people to task.  He's, uh, he doesn't give a fuck what people think of him.  I guess.  Yeah.  You know what?  I really should say when he was, when he was speaker of the house, he was constantly  being like pounded by the press and, and, uh, his, uh, the opposition and, uh, like  he's been through it already.  So when people jump on him about things, he doesn't get flustered.  He doesn't have, he, he doesn't sit there not knowing how to deal with it. 
[02:29:00]  Right.  Like he knows he just gets on and, and addresses it.  Right.  Uh, he's a professional politician.  Let's not, let's not have any illusions here.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's a, a grassroots guy, you know, he's the guy's a Washington fucking mainstay.  He's no better than the rest of them.  Both sides, by the way.  I'm a both sides guy.  Right.  I think they're all full of shit.  But I do think Obama is, uh, uh, ripe for the taking.  And, um, well, you guys better get a candidate then, man.  I really think it's going to be Romney. 
[02:29:30]  Romney.  I don't think people believe what Romney's saying.  I think Newt could take him.  Really?  I really do.  Wow.  Because Republicans are going to vote for the Republican candidate.  Sure.  And there's a lot of, uh, liberals, independents, and Democrats that are disillusioned with Obama.  Right.  Uh, whether they vote for Newt or not is, uh, to be seen.  But if they just sit out and, uh, if Obama can't stir up that passion that he had four  years ago to get, uh, uh, people to vote for him. 
[02:30:00]  Right.  Like he did.  He had people come in out of the woodwork to have that first black president and the hope  and change thing that he had going.  If he can't muster those people again, this time around, he's in trouble.  He's ripe for the taking.  And a lot of people are very disillusioned.  The angle I want to take here is, uh, have you ever seen a debate season like this where  everyone's fucking up?  Uh, well, no, no, they, I'm trying to remember like, man, that Perry, I'm trying to remember  back to, uh, you know, past, uh, debates and I don't remember, you know, you had the stock 
[02:30:30]  Dale with a, who am I?  Who am I?  What am I doing here?  So you had your moments.  You had, uh, what's his name there?  Um, you're no fucking John.  Oh, that was a perfect, whatever.  He stepped on a landmine on that one.  So there's been, there's been a few, but this, this time around, holy fuck, they're all  looking like idiots.  They're all looking like dummies in the hot tub.  A lot of, yeah.  Michelle Bachman, what did she say about Iran?  There's going to be, uh, Rick Perry right now. 
[02:31:00]  It's also, everything is everywhere now.  So it's like, you can't go find, you have to get, have your shit together for every interview  because all you got to do, like the Herman Cain thing where he didn't know anything.  Embassy in Iran!  And I didn't fucking get the answer from anyone.  It's all about the timing. 
[02:31:30]  She's like, if I'm president, there won't be an embassy in Iran.  And people are like, uh, we haven't had one since 1979.  Remember that little hostage thing?  Right.  So she did that, the Rick Perry thing is...  Rick Perry said that, uh, when you're, if you're 21...  Right.  Uh, vote for him on, uh, November 12th.  November 12th.  Oh, that's the clip?  Oh, you got that?  Yes.  Yeah, here's Rick Perry.  And it's all fun and games with this Rick Perry, but the fact is, he's the governor of Texas,  which is like a small country.  He's in charge.  He's a good old boy. 
[02:32:00]  He's already in charge of a lot of shit.  You nailed it.  He's a good old boy that looks like he just drinks a little bourbon.  Oh, yeah.  He loves the bourbon.  And stuff.  Possibly in a little golf.  And if I may get into a little Seinfeld episode, he does remind me of one of those guys that's  like, you tell those bastards over there, that son of a bitch.  From the Houston Astros.  Yeah, yeah.  From the Houston Astros.  It's like the Texans, he's one of those guys, I think.  Ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  Well, you bastards.  Yeah, he gets by by smiling and just having that kind of... 
[02:32:30]  Good old boy.  That personality, you know what I mean?  He seems like he's high.  Right.  Oh, yeah, he does.  Hit that.  This is Rick Perry.  Latest golf.  They call him golf.  A golf.  Golf without the L.  Without the L.  Now, that would be GAFF.  Yes.  Speaking at a college in New Hampshire yesterday, he didn't seem to know that the U.S. voting age  is 18.  Jesus.  You're this close to be the president.  We'll be 21 by November the 12th. 
[02:33:00]  I ask for your support and your vote.  Those of you who won't be, just work hard.  Because you're going to inherit this.  Perry also got the election day wrong.  It's November 6th.  Not the 12th.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  He almost does a George W. there.  Work hard.  Yeah, I know, I know.  Yeah, won't you work hard?  It's unbelievable.  These guys are that close to being the president.  There's only a handful of guys we're going to pick from.  And they're all looking like dummies in the hot tub.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you know what? 
[02:33:30]  He's in the top five of people who could be president.  Right.  Yeah.  And he doesn't know basic shit.  He doesn't know what the voting age is or what the election day is.  Election day.  And Bachman's big thing was, no embassy in Iran.  Like, she went over the top with it.  Like, this is my stance.  You should study things like, when is election day?  When's the election age?  You shouldn't have to study that.  That should be top of the head shit.  What's the succession for the president?  Like, things that you might have to answer.  Like, simple things. 
[02:34:00]  Right.  You should just, you should study this and know it.  My problem with Romney, he looks like he's this close to a nervous breakdown all the time.  Yeah.  Like a, like a Yorkshire Terrier in a thunderstorm.  Yeah.  Just all freaked out sitting in the bathtub.  He, he looks like he's, it takes everything in his, in his being to keep it together.  Yeah.  And then at any moment, he's getting, something is going to trigger a massive fucking nervous breakdown.  Constantly has his guard up.  Yeah.  And the minute that he starts to bring it down and, and speak like a person, somebody next to him talks and he goes, oh. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I think he, he goes through life.  Like, he's just repeating over and over in his head.  Don't fuck this up.  Don't fuck this up.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  And then Herman Cain.  Oh, you got the detective clip.  Ah.  Look, man.  I was, I was all in going, look, the guy was, you know, wasn't, well, I was saying he wasn't sexually harassing women, but he was absolutely, you know, making a move. 
[02:35:00]  He was getting around.  And he's married and like, and then he lies about it.  He's, I mean, come on, let's be real here.  Well, this is how it went down last night on Sean Hannity's show.  He's saying that you flew around the country.  She's saying that you were meeting in hotels.  Can we get plane tickets, confirmation?  Can we get hotels?  Don't a lot of these hotels have videotapes that they, some of them, I would assume, hang on to those tapes forever.  John, do me a favor. 
[02:35:30]  Let's not play detective.  I am going to prove that I am going to reestablish my character.  Okay.  Good luck.  Good luck with that.  Let's not be, I'm no Sherlock Holmes.  That was the moment where he says, yes, let's find all that evidence to exonerate me.  Not, no, no, let's not say detective.  Yes, I would love to see if those hotels and whatnot do have videotape.  Right.  When this, the new woman came out, he's like, well, let's see what she has to say.  Before I talk, in my own defense, I wants to know what she says first. 
[02:36:00]  Right.  Someone asked him, like, look, another woman coming out.  You would say, look, once again, I'm not cheating on my wife.  But he goes, well, let's see what she has to say first.  I don't know.  Even though they texted him from her phone.  Right.  And he called him back and it was the news.  That's classic.  That's sitting in a hot tub like a dummy.  Yeah, exactly.  Right there.  Hello.  Sorry I'm overusing that, but it fucking makes me howl.  Yeah, baby.  What you want?  What are you looking for tonight?  The news?  He would have been better off going to Sean Hannity. 
[02:36:30]  I didn't do shit.  I didn't do shit.  Man, I didn't do nothing.  Yeah, he's done-ski.  But he's one of these guys that, you know, because he's loving the limelight and he might  be a pathological liar.  He's like, I'm fucking hanging in there, man.  He should have stopped this whole thing like weeks ago.  I could just tell more lies and I'll be fine.  And people will still put cameras in my face and I'll be popular and be able to get more  white women. 
[02:37:00]  This am great.  I said he wanted to be president for the chicks.  Oh, yeah.  I went into radio for the chicks.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He went into politics for the chicks.  A little known fact.  You know.  Like the matresses.  I went into his business for the chicks at first.  Yeah.  And then it became something, I guess.  That's what he's doing.  But he wants to be president for the chicks.  Fuck the pizza pie.  I'm going to the meetings for the girls.  Godfather pizza.  What's with Godfather pizza, too?  I've never had it.  It's sort of a stereotype thing.  Well, we're, uh...  Yeah, he's not Italian. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, he's not Italian.  Where did he, uh...  Where is the Godfather pizza?  I don't know, but it's sort of...  Do we have it around here?  As an Italian, I feel like that would be going Sambo's fucking, uh...  Watermelon.  You see the corporate mascot of Godfather's Pizza?  Yeah, it's a guy dressed like a gangster.  Listen, Ant, I don't want to offend you.  I'm offended.  That guy's a guinea.  He is a wop.  That guy.  That is a wop-ass wop motherfucker.  Ah, shit.  Look at this guy asking you.  Join my e-club today.  Godfather pizza is like fucking... 
[02:38:00]  That is really racist.  Really racist.  If I gave a shit, I'd give a shit.  Uh, this comes up every time, so let's let Brandy have a little time on the show.  All right, here it comes.  Brandy in Oklahoma.  Go ahead, Brandy.  Go ahead.  Yeah, I was just wondering when you're going to talk about Ron Paul, because all the rest  of them have something...  I think, uh, he looked more like a chick back about ten years ago, uh, but now that you've  seen him without the makeup on... 
[02:38:30]  No, no, no.  I don't think...  What?  Yes.  You're describing RuPaul.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, see?  Yeah.  Fuck.  See, now, I...  All right.  Now, Ron Paul, by the way, is, uh, I like a lot of Ron Paul's ideas, but Ron Paul looks  insane, uh, and looks have a lot to do with the presidency.  And he doesn't...  Unfortunately, you know, he has no personality.  Yeah.  And I'm embarrassed to say that's what it takes, but it is. 
[02:39:00]  It does.  It's part of the whole fucking game.  You gotta have some charisma.  Charisma, some personality.  I don't think it should be that way, but...  The voters absolutely vote if someone has some personality.  I love his less government-in-your-life shit, and I love his tax plan.  He has some good ideas.  He's got great ideas, but he's never gonna crack that fucking, um...  That percentage he needs to really be a serious candidate.  Oh, can we get the...  Well, let's help him out!  Let's help him out!  How are we gonna help the motherfucker out?  He's a Frank Perdue-looking motherfucker! 
[02:39:30]  Motherfucker?  Yeah, but you got so much power, Anthony.  You can just tell everyone to vote for him, and they'll listen to you.  Uh, no.  I wish I had that kind of power.  If we had so much...  We wouldn't be dealing with four years of what we've been dealing with.  And if we had so much power, we'd have a hell of a lot more Twitter followers.  Oh, yeah!  We'll start with that.  Exactly.  Before we elect the president.  There's a whole gauge of how much power you have now.  Yeah, we don't have shit.  Well, just throw in a Ron Paul...  Ron Paul for president.  There you go. 
[02:40:00]  Let's do it.  Vote for Ron Paul.  Let's do this.  There you go.  Now watch.  Let's do this.  Oh, he's already up three percentage points.  No, that's the problem here, too.  In two seconds.  His number stays exactly the same, too.  It just never budges.  It doesn't move up.  It doesn't move down.  It's the same people that love him just, like, stick with him.  No one else gets on board.  He can't get the new ones.  I don't know.  Hey, can we play the Rick Perry commercial?  Rick Perry is an asshole.  What you're about to hear is the guy that is the governor of Texas.  Yeah.  And he's still going with the whole fucking gaffe he had during the debate.  This is his brand new commercial. 
[02:40:30]  It just hit.  Commerce, education, and the...  What's the third one there?  Department of Energy.  You know, we've all lost our train of thought before, but not many have done it on national TV.  Now, if you want a slick debater, I'm obviously not your guy.  What?  But if you want a clean house in Washington with a balanced budget amendment, a flat tax, and a part-time Congress, I'm your man.  I'm Rick Perry.  What's that line again?  I'm Rick Perry, and I approve of this message. 
[02:41:00]  Now, can I start...  He's doing shtick.  Can I start?  Yeah.  You would swear this is an SNL bit.  Right.  But he's dead serious.  This is his new commercial.  That's a commercial.  And this is how he's handling it.  And the problem is, you have to be a good debater if you're the president of the United States.  That's why they want you to debate, to see how you handle situations.  Yeah, because you're going to be talking to people and trying to sell them on your point of view.  Right.  So you really need to...  You really know how to fucking change someone's opinion by debating them. 
[02:41:30]  The great communicator.  Yes.  Right.  The great communicator.  Right.  This would be like me sending out air checks of my John Walsh introduction to other radio stations saying,  I laugh it off, but I can interview people.  I just called John Walsh his murdered headless son's name.  Right.  No problem.  What's that guy's name again?  This is getting crazy, man.  It's insane.  It's really fucking weird this time around.  People are saying that we've always had this. 
[02:42:00]  I just don't remember it like this.  A debate season that is just all over the place.  Well, all right.  All right.  Dukakis was a pretty big douchebag.  Sure.  He was a weenie.  And he was this close to being the president.  He was close.  With that tank helmet and his big bobble head out of the tank.  Remember that one?  That fucked him up.  That was the jumping of the shark.  There it is.  There's his dumb head in the tank.  He was doing really, really well up to that point.  He looked like a bobble head doll.  He looked ridiculous.  Classic.  And then Kitty Dukakis. 
[02:42:30]  We used to do a lot of bits on her.  Yeah.  She loved her drink.  Spraying hair.  Drink would be one thing.  She was spraying hairspray in her mouth and drinking fucking Lysol.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you can't admit you're not a good debater.  No.  That's really important.  That's in the job description, I think.  I might not be a good debater, but, well.  Then he'd be a terrible president.  Ah, but if you want a debater to, what?  So when he goes, if he's a president, is he saying that when he goes in to meet with 
[02:43:00]  world leaders, he'll have the best interest of our country at heart, but he just won't  be able to tell the person that.  So we might not get everything we want.  He's going to say a lot.  Oh, that's a good point.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He sold me on some things.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Mr. President, what happened when you met with the Russian leader?  Apparently I gave away 13 states.  Godfather's Pizza is in Hess gas stations? 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  They got a bunch in New Jersey, not in New York.  You eat that shit when you're desperate.  Oh, hell yeah.  Yeah.  You, you, if you want pizza, you don't go to Godfather's Pizza.  They make you an offer you can't refuse.  Hey, ah.  Look at the guys in the pinstripe suit with the fedora on.  What's your favorite pizza?  Yeah.  What's your favorite pizza?  My favorite pizza is probably Vincent's Pizza in Roslyn. 
[02:44:00]  And yes, Vincent's Pizza.  Mmm.  Mmm.  I love it.  You will too.  Before I lived in New York, I, I, it was, it was a no brainer.  Domino's, believe it or not.  Ew.  With the yellow peppers, the yellow banana peppers.  You're in New York.  You don't get dominoes.  I said before, I lived in New York.  I lived in a lot of dumb places.  You always lived in New York, didn't you?  I did radio everywhere.  You forget.  You can't get good pizza in like Buffalo, right?  No.  Isn't yellow peppers Papa John's? 
[02:44:30]  I don't know.  I, I, I got it on my dominoes though.  I would always ask for the yellow banana peppers.  Oh, I thought you meant the one.  See, Papa John's, they put one inside the box.  Yeah.  What do you mean they put one inside the box?  They put, they put a, a, a pepper inside the box.  Oh.  And you have to cut it up yourself?  I don't know.  Ask.  What do they do it so the box doesn't hit the pizza?  Maybe.  Well, how big do you think the pepper is?  I don't know.  It's just a little pepper.  A little pepper.  Oh, I thought like a whole pepper.  They just smacked it in the middle of the pizza.  No, no, no, no.  Like those little, I like the little round picnic tables they put in the middle of your 
[02:45:00]  pizza so the box doesn't squish it on the cheese.  It always works.  No, it doesn't ever.  My go-to food was when I was, what?  It was Pizza Hut spaghetti.  Pizza Hut.  And I wouldn't get the pizza.  Oh.  I would get the spaghetti.  Spaghetti with a watery sauce.  I fucking loved it.  You sop it up with the bread.  I don't even know if it's good anymore.  That is good stuff.  You know what?  That watery sauce on the bread was kind of good when you were stoned.  I had that for lunch fucking three, four days a week.  Easy.  I remember in California going to the Straw Hat Pizza Palace and playing video games. 
[02:45:30]  Was there pizza good?  The new thing called video games.  Yeah.  Yeah, no, the pizza sucked.  Really?  But they had like games that were really fucking kind of cool for the time.  I'll tell you the best pizza on Long Island.  Yeah.  Easily.  It's a place we call heroin pizza because it's one of those things.  You just got to keep eating it.  Is that in Centiport?  It's in Huntington.  Oh.  Across from the old Fast Eddie's.  Oh, right.  That place is great.  Right on the corner.  It's just slices. 
[02:46:00]  Slices all day long.  Those big slices, too.  But I never saw this anywhere else.  I've never seen this offered anywhere else, but their thing is cold cheese on top.  What?  You get your fucking piping hot slice of pizza with the cheese.  It's a regular slice.  Yeah.  Enough sauce, by the way.  A lot of these fucking pizza joints, you know, they don't give you enough sauce, which  drives me nuts.  Hey, they skimp on the sauce.  They skimp on the sauce.  Now my mother, she made it all model.  And then they take a fucking fistful of cold cheese and right on top to finish off the 
[02:46:30]  slice.  Yeah.  Crazy talk.  And between the cold cheese and the hot cheese, it's perfect.  Does the cold cheese, like, melt a little bit?  Better.  It starts melting right away because the slice itself is piping hot.  All right.  Then that's good.  As long as it's melted.  I forgot the name of the place.  It's right across from the old Fast Eddie's on New York Avenue, which is the same street  as F.H. Reilly's.  What are you trying to get a free slice?  My brother's restaurant.  Oh.  How do you pick?  How do you pick? 
[02:47:00]  It was...  Oh, Vincent.  Best pizza is Vincent's in Huntington, right across the street from F.H. Reilly's, which  is located...  I guess it's called Vincent's, which isn't right across the street.  Please.  They're kind of on the corner of Main Street and New York Avenue.  I just plugged another one.  Huh?  Little Vincent's?  Little Vincent's.  I just plugged another Vincent's.  What happened?  Two pizza places with the name Vincent's?  No, the name Vincent's?  That's crazy.  Wait, is that the one I'm talking about?  Yeah.  Little Vincent's.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, look.  See?  They show with the...  Yeah.  With the cold cheese.  Jesus Christ.  That's a fistful of cheese they throw on there. 
[02:47:30]  You probably shouldn't go there often if you're trying to, you know...  Live?  Keep your figure.  Yeah, live.  Even better, live.  That's crazy talk.  Dude, I'm telling you.  The line after the bars closed in the old days, especially, out the fucking door.  Look, that's not saying anything.  I remember the line at fucking Jack in the Box was huge.  That's true.  With the baby shit tacos they'd give you.  True.  Looked like baby...  What kind of meat looks like baby diarrhea in a taco shell?  And you'd eat it like it was fucking filet mignon. 
[02:48:00]  True.  And then whatever was left, you'd throw at the windows of the Jack in the Box.  Boy, they were the most abused fucking place.  Because it's like three in the morning, you're drunk off your ass, you go through the drive-thru  of course, you order a bunch of shit you can't possibly eat, you eat as much as you  can, and then through the rest at the giant glass windows at Jack in the Box.  And some poor schlub had to come out and clean the fucking window.  A bunch of scumbags.  Look at that slice.  With the cold cheese on top of the hot pizza. 
[02:48:30]  It's as big as your arm.  Fuck is that.  I want one right the fuck now.  Yeah.  Some guy, he hung up though, because he couldn't commit.  He's like, Buffalo has the best pizza.  No, it doesn't.  He was on hold for ten seconds, because he couldn't commit to it.  Yeah.  He couldn't commit to try to convince the world that Buffalo has the best pizza.  Stop it.  It's all about wings up there.  We all know that.  And the hottest chicks, right?  Wow.  Stop.  Well, the Buffalo Bettys, you know, you'd knock back a few Buffalo Bettys if you had  enough JÃ¤germeister.  Get that ass. 
[02:49:00]  You got to go to Westchester for the pizza.  There's one place in Westchester that will surprise you.  No one Buffalo's known for, too.  In the Maranek.  Stop.  Westchester's not that good.  Westchester's the best Chester.  No, it's not the best Chester.  It's not just an ironic thing people say.  It's moronic.  Buffalo also had, and Rochester, but Buffalo, they dressed up every Friday for fish fry.  Oh, fish fry.  That's their, I don't know.  They must have got rid of fish fry by now.  I've been out of Buffalo a long time.  It doesn't matter. 
[02:49:30]  They can't be doing fish fry every Friday, but people will get excited.  I got kind of caught up in the wave of the fish fry movement.  I bet they're going to say, no, they're still doing it.  And then it's like, no, you got to go here.  I can't remember restaurants anymore.  That sucks.  What?  Paul has been a part of Fish Fry Friday.  Oh, boy.  You did Buffalo?  I lived in Buffalo for a year, when I was 21, 20.  Did I know this?  No, probably not.  Did you go to, where do you used to drink?  The Black Rock Saloon, because they used to have the dice game. 
[02:50:00]  Hey!  It's my game!  I love that game!  The Black Rock Saloon.  Where is it located?  It was in, oh, shit.  Park Ave?  No, it was in the hood.  It was definitely in the hood.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Scary.  I used to be a door-to-door salesman up there, and I used to go hood robin'.  What year was this?  2000?  The 50s?  2000?  Yeah.  Buffalo's.  Steak, chicken, and seafood?  Door-to-door?  Biff Loma.  Door-to-door.  Door-to-door?  What, you would just knock on restaurants? 
[02:50:30]  No.  No, we would knock on people's houses.  Oh, my God.  Omaha Steaks, shit like that.  Oh, my God.  That's a handy-dandy vacuum.  Walla Walla, Washington.  Tell me about the Fish Fry.  The phones are lit.  What is that?  Every bar had Fish Fry Friday, and it was beer-battered fish.  Beer-battered fish.  It was shitty fish.  Thank you.  I was about to say that.  You beat me to it.  It was always shitty fish.  And that's why they put the beer batter on and deep-fried the shit out of it.  You didn't realize you were eating shitty fish anymore.  Yeah, with, like, disgusting four-day-old tartar sauce on the side. 
[02:51:00]  The one that gets kind of dry and lumpy.  Yeah.  It turned yellow instead of that white.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like old cum.  He's not joking, man.  Like old cum.  Like old cum out of your balls.  Ah, you're old.  I don't have old man cum yet.  No, no.  I don't mean old cum like that.  I mean, like, let's say you've been, like, excited for quite a while.  You're with a girl, and, like, fucking you're not cumming. 
[02:51:30]  And then you cum.  It could get a little yellowish.  Mm-hmm.  Mine looks like pure hand lotion still, man.  Like Juergens?  It's fucking pure as fucking snow.  Jerkins.  Yeah, but they're fish fries.  You used to call it jerkins.  Say, yeah.  I got it.  And they would have, like, beer pitcher specials, because they knew that the fish was shitty.  So whatever it took to fucking get that meal down.  Is that the one day a week they didn't eat wings?  Yeah.  Yeah, pretty much. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  No, he's not.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, the average life expectancy up there is 47 years old.  Fuck, man.  Between the wings and the stupid fish fry battered dip shit.  That's the average.  It's all fat chicks up there, too.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we nicknamed them years ago Buffalo Bettys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Of course.  They would wear their oversized Buffalo Bills sweatshirts.  So you couldn't even tell if they had nice tits.  No.  Just huge.  It was just like, it just made them all look like snowmen. 
[02:52:30]  God, they would wear that loose-fitting top to try to hide it, but you could tell they're  giant.  It was always a lot of sweatshirts and a lot of...  Stretch pants.  A lot of the girls in Buffalo dressed like dudes.  That's sexy.  Almost like they had, they just shared clothes with their husbands or boyfriends.  Great.  I'm serious.  That was the look they were going for.  Were there, like...  Especially when...  If you went to a bar to look for girls, were there hot chicks to...  Well, from...  Grated on a curve?  Honestly, from about October 15th to almost May, you couldn't tell. 
[02:53:00]  You couldn't tell?  Because they had their winter gear on, man.  Now, there were some hot girls up there.  Go to the park bench.  I just went local.  I don't even know the park bench.  That was...  And the Brick Bar.  The Brick Bar?  Brick how...  Brick...  Brick something.  Ow!  Ow!  Oh, you know what?  Mighty Mighty.  I just sounded really cocky.  Park bench is Stony Brook.  I'm mixing up my radio career and where I used to hang out. 
[02:53:30]  Did they do Thursdays in the Square?  It was the Brick Bar, I think.  What?  Thursdays in the Square when they'd have local bands just play out in the street.  It was like the one month out of the year it was warm up there.  What, downtown?  Yeah, downtown they did.  Sounds like a vacation mecca.  When I was down...  When I was in Buffalo, downtown was zombie heaven.  Downtown.  It was...  You didn't get caught in downtown Buffalo when the sun went down.  Really?  It was a scary fucking place.  It was a place you can go downtown. 
[02:54:00]  Downtown.  Brick yard?  Oh, boy.  No, Brick Bar.  And then a place that I'll get killed for saying this, but the Pink Flamingo.  No, the Pink...  The Nudie Bar?  No, what the fuck?  Nudie, but how old are you?  I forgot the name of the place.  The Boobie Bar.  It might have been called the Pink Flamingo, but it was a cool, like, kind of punk type,  like, edgy place.  No, it was definitely a strip club by that time.  By the time I was in the place.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I think it had the same name, though, if I remember correctly. 
[02:54:30]  I mean, it was ten years ago.  Yeah.  Kevin!  What's going on, guys?  Kevin Hart, man.  This is a nice surprise.  How are you, brother?  I'm good.  I'm good.  I'm good.  You hanging in there?  Yeah, man.  You know, because times could be a little better.  Yeah, no shit, huh?  Due to the circumstances, but I can't complain.  Yeah, this one just...  We've been saying it all week.  This one just fucking hurts.  If people don't know, Kevin Hart knew Patrice O'Neal real well.  Yeah. 
[02:55:00]  This was a...  Dude, you know what?  I can't even...  I don't like to be down, dude.  But this one hit me a little hard.  You know, it definitely...  You know, we can't say that it was a shocker, because we knew he was in the hospital.  We knew that things definitely weren't great.  But, you know, reality doesn't hit you until you're really, really smacked in the face with it.  You know, in our mind, it's like, all right, well, he's in the hospital, but he'll be all right.  Big dummy will be good.  You know, it's not that serious. 
[02:55:30]  Or, you know, it's a matter of time before he's out and back to himself.  And, you know, after a while, you just didn't hear nothing.  You didn't hear any news.  You didn't hear any good news or bad news.  So the way that I'm thinking is no news is good news.  And then, literally Monday, you know, he was smacked with the whole wild Patrice.  He passed away.  And, dude, I honestly...  I just sat down and canceled my day.  I didn't do anything.  I talked to Keith for a while.  You know, in reality, hit me a little later. 
[02:56:00]  You know, as a man, you don't like Prime.  As a man, you don't like it.  But it's weird when it actually comes out because you realize the one that you're closest to, dude.  And I lost a good one.  Yeah.  I really, really lost a close friend.  So it was a low blow.  Yeah.  You're kidding.  I still haven't been able to wrap my mind around this at all.  I've just been walking through the last month just numb.  It kind of sucked that we couldn't give anyone updates because we sort of knew right from the beginning  that this stroke was a motherfucker. 
[02:56:30]  And people were all trying to stay positive.  We all just knew what the outcome was going to be, unfortunately.  You never know.  You always hear those stories where it's like, wow, you know, it was supposedly really bad.  But then, you know, something happened.  People, you know, will bring up the word miracle.  Right.  And you always hope for that.  Absolutely.  But in this case, that never happened.  And, yeah, it's such a fucking bummer because he was just a, you know, and Collins had a one of a kind. 
[02:57:00]  You know, there's no one even close to being like him.  You know, he's irreplaceable in that way.  That's funny you say that because that's what I say.  When reality hits, you realize exactly what a person was worth, what their self-worth was.  Right.  And what they meant to the business.  And, you know, when it comes to stand-up comedy, man, the one thing that comedians attempt to do is pride themselves on originality. 
[02:57:30]  You know, everybody attempts to be different.  They attempt to be clever.  They attempt to be witty, you know, or smart or groundbreaking.  And people really don't understand how groundbreaking Patrice was, you know, from dealing with the business, from not wanting to be the guy that was Hollywood, from refusing to let agents and managers dictate his career, to not being afraid to tell people to shut their mouth. 
[02:58:00]  Like, if they were out of line, like, the man definitely was, he was on a different plateau, man.  And, you know, I think now people are honestly going to understand what that man's worth was to comedy, you know, after going back and looking at his body at work.  So it's sad that we got to miss him this way for people to realize it.  But, you know, I think now people will honestly understand the talent that Patrice O'Meara was.  Yeah, I said it earlier.  He's going to be massively huge in death, unfortunately, when they should have realized when he was alive. 
[02:58:30]  And he was about to hit on his own terms.  He was right there, finally, on his own terms.  He was going to make it the way he wanted to.  And that hurts, too, you know, because we all know that he definitely wanted that.  Very true, dude.  Very, very true.  Yeah.  Now you guys are going to witness me.  Try not to cry.  And if I do cry and you repeat it, I swear to God, I'm a punchbowl.  Yeah.  I mean, I've seen a lot of tough guys cried in the last week. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, it's just been so tough because, yeah, he's just so fucking original and different.  You take it for granted when he was in here doing the show.  You took for granted everything from his big, dumb, booming laugh to, you know, his take on relationships and shit like that.  And then when you realize that you're never going to get that anymore, it becomes really, really sad, you know.  And he was never not funny. 
[02:59:30]  Yep.  Never.  I mean, whether the mics were on, the mics were off, or we were just hanging out in the street, or just taking an elevator ride, he made it interesting.  Everything.  He was always on.  You guys are beyond true.  Yeah.  Beyond it, man.  Beyond the dude.  Well, you know, like I said, I don't like to be the Debbie Downer.  You know, I believe that when things like this happen, you have to find a positive at some place. 
[03:00:00]  Right.  So, you know, my positive is simply I'm honestly happy and blessed to say that I was a friend of this man.  Yeah.  You know, with this loss, I'm trying to deal with it as best as I can.  But, you know, let's take the time to celebrate that man's life and what he's done.  Oh, yeah.  If you are a Patrice O'Neal fan out there, and if you, you know, if you were affected by it at all, just go back and understand, if he really was here, Patrice is the type of dude that'll tell you to shut up and stop crying about it. 
[03:00:30]  All right.  Get over it.  You know what I mean?  Knowing that well, to where I know that that will come out, man.  So, you know, I can't do nothing but express my love, my condolences to his family and friends.  Yeah.  Because, you know, I'm going to do what I'm supposed to and be there as a friend and support those other, you know, the other guys that are there.  And as comedians, you know, it's funny because things like this will bring us all closer together.  So, you know, we're going to pull together and do what we can for his family, you know, outside of the funeral just to make sure that they're okay. 
[03:01:00]  Because, like I said, we lost a close one.  So, for us, it's making sure that he's okay all around right now.  Right on.  Yeah.  That's for sure, man.  So, Kevin, thanks so much, man.  No problem, guys.  I'll see you later.  I'll come in and it'll be on a different time.  Yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  We look forward to that, Kevin.  No problem, guys.  You're safe.  Thank you, man.  Kevin Hart, everyone.  Bye.  Bye.  Yeah, it's such a bummer.  I can't wait until this is all just, like, you know, behind us. 
[03:01:30]  It's such a bummer.  It's, uh...  You're having fun and then you're all of a sudden bummed out.  It's that proverbial emotional roller coaster.  Yeah, it's all going down on Monday.  Like, I can't wait for Tuesday because then it becomes what it is.  Yeah, and then you just got a deal.  And that's obviously going to suck too, but at least...  Move on, as they say.  At least you're at that point.  Yeah, yeah.  And then you can kind of almost focus and celebrate his life and... 
[03:02:00]  Fucker.  Almost start, you know, kind of smiling a bit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, obviously, we try to have a good time and have some fun and everything, and we do.  It's not an act, but it's just, it's always there, you know, under the surface.  And then you get a situation where it pops its head up and, you know, you realize, oh, fuck.  And then you got to get back to, you know, pussy and dick jokes and...  Fish fry Friday.  Assholes and fish fry.  Someone's saying it's because they're all Catholic. 
[03:02:30]  Weenies and heinies and...  Yeah.  Peepees.  Peepees.  Talking about your cum.  Hainies, yellow cum.  Someone said, is it...  Yeah.  Maybe Anthony's cumming beer.  Right.  Fuck you.  You might want to throw water in there every once in a while.  No, it happens when it...  Yeah, I might want to drink some fucking water.  You know, to fucking dull it up a little bit.  Water...  Hey, beer's made with water, right?  There's water in it.  Yeah, there's water in it. 
[03:03:00]  If you get...  If you build up a load but don't shoot it and then wait for a while, it's going to get a little gacky.  It's going to be a little different when you finally do blow the load.  I think that's how you get a dummy, too.  Really?  It's dumb old yellow cum?  Yellow cum is idiot juice.  Or right?  It's yellow cum, or right?  Yeah, that's how you make morons.  You got to keep that sperm fresh all the time. 
[03:03:30]  Just in case.  Just keep jerking it.  That's such a dick thing to say.  People go through hell with that.  Oh, boy.  Listen, Al in New York has something on the fish fry.  What do you got, Al?  Hey, listen, guys.  It's because I grew up in Rochester and they do the same crap.  It's because of Lent.  They're not supposed to eat meat on Fridays.  Oh!  It's because they enjoy fucking fried food.  It's actually a religious thing?  Well, yeah, I think so. 
[03:04:00]  That's stupid.  Growing up as one of the only Jews up there, I would sit around my...  I shrug my shoulders all the time over the house.  I was lucky enough to live in Boston as well.  Boston has a lot of those Catholics.  Why aren't they doing the fish fry Friday?  Catholic.  I don't know.  I was in Boston with you guys, too.  And I don't know...  No, you weren't!  I never met you!  I never saw him, Opie.  Indeed.  I listened to you guys all the time when I was in college.  I don't believe you.  How old are you now?  Oh, boy.  35.  Oh, that's great.  That's great. 
[03:04:30]  Child of the 80s.  Child of the 80s.  Watch it now.  All right, thanks.  All right.  You punch out 35.  Jesus Christ.  I didn't know Kevin Hart was calm.  Fuck.  It's the effect Patrice had on people.  Yeah.  Yep.  Absolutely.  Should we go to break with a moment of silence?  I like when other shows do that.  It's very dramatic.  It'll be the best part of the show.  And then a commercial comes on for dick cream.  A fucking ball fucking freshener. 
[03:05:00]  X-X-X-mas.  X-X-X-mas.  Look out.  No moment of silence.  That's such fucking hack shit when they do it on TV.  I know.  Plus, it's just dead air on the radio.  It doesn't even hit.  Yeah.  You can't see anything.  People just tuning in.  They're like, where'd they go?  Next station.  We'll go somewhere else.  Fuck this.  I can't wait the .001 second.  We go to break?  Yes, we do.  I almost slipped and said home.  No, we're not going home.  We've got more show after this. 
[03:05:30]  What?  Since he said it.  No, there's more show after this.  We're going to go to break.  I think the time would be well spent remembering Patrice O'Neal.  I think so, too.  Okay.  Patrice would want us.  Patrice would want us to go home early and start our weekends.  We've moved past this to the point where now we're just using the tragedy to our own benefit.  No, no, no.  You could look at it that way, Sam, and I'm sure you'll get angry tweets for looking at it like that.  I will.  Yes, but we're not looking at that.  No.  I already got, by the way, one angry tweet from a person who thinks I should be killed because I compared Bobo to Carlin. 
[03:06:00]  Apparently, wait a minute.  Weren't you joking?  Yeah.  People are adults.  Please just understand that much.  Just understand that much.  Nobody would seriously compare George Carlin to Bobo.  I know sarcasm's hard when you write it, but when you hear someone using sarcasm, it's pretty obvious most times.  You could usually tell.  The speed skating guy is going to drive me nuts all day.  Yeah.  Bruce Jenner won the decathlon.  Well, he did, Opie.  There are people who just sit by their radios waiting to either criticize or correct something, and that's the only reason they listen. 
[03:06:30]  Maybe they're insane.  They're crazy people.  There's got to be a percentage of the audience that is legitimately completely insane.  Lunatics.  Oh, my God.  And I think it's larger than most other shows.  I think so, too.  I got one.  Yeah?  I don't know if I got to find this person.  She tweets me stuff.  Oh.  I know it's English.  Oh, really?  Because I see the words.  They're English words, but how she puts them together?  Yeah.  Holy mother of Jesus. 
[03:07:00]  Unconventional.  It's unbelievable, because sometimes you can figure out, okay, what they're trying to say.  She uses words in a way I have no fucking idea.  These words shouldn't be in any sentence together, let alone this one.  And I don't want to blow up her spot, because I actually enjoy how ridiculous it is.  You're talking about Bobo.  Yeah.  Bobo is a genius.  Bobo's Twitter is the best puzzle game I've played.  No.  I got one better.  I really do.  And I don't know if I'm going to be able to find it.  While you're looking, I want to read a text I sent yesterday by accident, because Siri turned 
[03:07:30]  on in my pocket.  Uh-oh.  And I was having a conversation with Joe Curry, my buddy Plankfoot, and I heard boom in my  pocket.  I was like, what the fuck?  And I had sent this text, call, let go, I don't know, wonder what gaveled you wearing  today that interrupted degrees. 
[03:08:00]  That is going, is glowing, ruck-rigle electricity is.  And sent.  And sent.  And I got back, what is that shit?  Who did it go to?  My chick.  It's like, click, it made, I was amazed at how random it was.  It didn't even try to put together a paragraph.  I can't find this broad. 
[03:08:30]  Can't find that broad.  You got it.  All right, whatever.  Let's, let's break, figure some shit out.  Because now everyone thinks I'm talking about them.  No.  Oh, see, they all want to be special.  Yeah.  They all think you're talking about them.  Yeah.  You probably think this tweet is about you.  Don't you, don't you?  You don't like that song?  No.  Can we go home?  No.  We should.  We're going to take a quick break, then there's more show.  People, I'm reading, I'll tell you, people are like, they're so out of here. 
[03:09:00]  We're not.  The show isn't ending.  They know us so well.  No, yeah.  You're coming back.  And you're not going to stall going to this break, so then you can go home.  You're taking a break now.  Oh, Sam.  You're going to come back and do more show.  You're officially working for the man.  You are.  You're working for the fucking man.  You're a shill.  Listen.  You're a fucking shill for the man.  You're working for the man.  We're going to take a break.  Yeah.  Do a couple of live reads.  Yeah.  And then we're going to come back, do more show.  Uh-huh. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Am I going to be able to wink?  Wink, wink.  We're coming back.  Am I going to be able to hear that more show from my truck?  Not from your truck.  From where you're sitting in your headphones.  In my truck.  Because it'll be your voice live.  Oh.  In this studio.  Patrice would have loved us to play some break.  I know.  No.  Patrice would have called you out for being phonies and using this tragedy for your own  benefit.  No.  Let me think.  No.  What he really would have wanted.  Yeah.  That's important right now.  We all know that.  Yeah.  He'd want us to go home.  No.  He enjoyed the show so much. 
[03:10:00]  I really thought about it.  We both gave it a moment.  You heard it.  Why don't we take a break and then come back and then we'll dedicate the break to Patrice.  Can you actually hear silence?  The sound of silence.  But I just said you actually heard silence.  Are you actually hearing silence?  Oh my God.  We have so many reads to do.  Oh God.  See this is the thing.  Maybe we should do one right now.  I love the shit show reads.  If you go home.  What?  I want to go home.  You have to sit here before you go home.  I want to go home.  Is there a law against. 
[03:10:30]  I know there's a law against texting and talking on the phone.  Is there a law against doing live reads from your vehicle as you're driving home?  Because that could be awesome.  I'm just going to put it out there.  It could be so awesome.  But I wouldn't want to get pulled over.  Right.  That'd be good.  Let me see that.  Let me see that.  Okay.  Because it'd be like this.  Argentium.  What is Argentium?  Does anyone know what Argentium is?  I'll tell you what it is.  It's Steven Singer's new.  You fucking savage. 
[03:11:00]  Move your cab, you piece of fucking shit.  God, you cocksuckers.  It's a brand new collection of super silver.  Start.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Yeah.  Wait.  I thought you were going to do the whole read.  You can keep it.  Steven Singer would be okay with it.  It's just a piece.  He would have loved that.  He really would have.  You can keep going with that read, though.  We'll knock one out.  That counts for the first time.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It does.  Count, Steven.  It counts.  Steven Singer's got the Argentium. 
[03:11:30]  It's a super silver, and it starts at just $149.  Argentium.  More pure than sterling.  Brighter than platinum, white, gold, and sterling.  Low maintenance.  Tarnish resistant.  And Argentium's responsible and ethical.  It wears a condom.  No, of course.  It's made from recycled silver.  And that doesn't mean, you know, that's bad.  That's a good thing.  You ever see a smelter recycle silver?  They get what off the top, it's called slag.  And they take all that crap out. 
[03:12:00]  And it's great silver.  I know a little bit about precious metals.  I stole some years ago from a place I worked at and sold it to a smelter.  Go online and check it out.  It's at IHateStevenSinger.com.  And view the new collection as super silver.  Have it shipped right to your door.  Free shipping.  Steven Singer's got that 365 days a year.  Don't forget about his 90-day full money-back guarantee, too.  Visit Steven Singer online at IHateStevenSinger.com.  On the phone, it's 888-I-HATE-STEVEN-Singer.  And in person, it's at the other corner of 8th and Walnut in Philadelphia. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  I hate Steven Singer.  We're still doing the show.  Don't take your headphones off.  Why?  I turned my mic off.  I know.  You get all excited.  And took my headphones off like I was leaving.  Why can't we go?  We are leaving!  We still have a show to do.  We're doing a show right now.  Sponsors to talk about.  I'm really close to finding this person.  Okay.  I mean, I think.  Well, do you want to...  You don't like me.  What?  What do you got over there? 
[03:13:00]  Let me see that.  You want to talk about something?  Let me see that.  I mean, well, Obi, what do you want to talk about, Ian?  That's so weird.  Well, actually, folks, I'd like to talk about people that have iPads.  I follow Ryan Starr.  Really?  Wow, that's an old one.  I want to talk about people that have iPads and iPhones.  You know?  Yeah.  If you do, you're probably in love with the thing.  I know.  I'm an iPad geek.  Got it.  And an iPhone geek.  And on your holiday list, there's only one place to go.  And that's Brookstone.  Yeah?  Brookstone's the place for all the coolest cases, charges. 
[03:13:30]  And music systems for your iPad and iPhone.  Why is that?  Well, they've got an iPad case with a Bluetooth wireless keyboard.  Yes, you can type fast through all those emails and Facebook posts.  Or you can get a Rover wireless spy tank.  You steer it with your Wi-Fi that streams live video and photos back to your iPad.  Or your iPhone.  Or your iPod Touch.  And it even has an infrared camera so you can see in the dark.  If your friend's into music or streaming radio, get them the big blue wireless Bluetooth speaker. 
[03:14:00]  Yes, big sound, small package.  No docks or cords.  If you know anyone with an iPad or an iPhone, go to Brookstone and find a Brookstone store near you.  Or shop online.  Go to brookstone.com.  It said visit, but I said go to.  And I almost said go to visit.  And that's silly.  Just go to brookstone.com.  Look, I didn't turn off my mic or headphones or anything. 
[03:14:30]  I follow a lot of idiots.  Do you?  Yeah, I just unfollowed 20 people.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  They finally announced the lineup for Celebrity Wife Swap.  What are you talking about?  What's that about?  Mick Foley, a long time ago, he was in here saying he had filmed Celebrity Wife Swap.  Right.  His wife spent a week with Antonio Sabata Jr.  Oh, right.  Oh, that's the guy.  We didn't know who the guy was, remember?  I wouldn't let Jess hang out with somebody that handsome. 
[03:15:00]  No?  Hey, we're all insulted now.  By herself, I'm saying.  I wouldn't wife swap Jess with either of you two either.  I've been called handsome, wouldn't either.  Well, okay.  I've been called handsome.  Yeah.  Ah!  You were really rolling down.  Roland nailed you.  What did he say?  He said by Troy.  By Troy.  I think he nailed Troy.  Implying Troy's gay.  Yeah.  By the way, your Dr. Gay nickname for Travis.  Dr. Gay.  Still standing strong in the back.  Is it good?  Yeah.  How's sexy on the charts? 
[03:15:30]  Moving up or down?  Sexy's moving way up.  Oh, yeah.  Sexy is moving way up.  Good.  Sexy, I mean, it's still sex, though.  Yeah, I mean, it's like, to his boys, it's like, what's up, sex?  No, it's sex-ee.  But when it's like.  I do a little hip-hop with that shit.  Oh, wait a minute.  I thought it was sexy with a Y.  It's sex and then E as an E-rock.  A capital E for E-rock.  That's right.  Oh.  Pronounce sexy.  But if we were going to lunch, we'd be like, sexy, let's go.  Sex-i.  Sex-i.  I like Beggs.  The Beggs.  The Beggs is pretty good.  You like that one?  That's more like, hey, how's the Beggs doing today? 
[03:16:00]  The Beggs.  What's the Beggs up to?  That's the cool guy.  Yeah, baby.  Jesus.  Whoa.  I follow Ted Williams.  Isn't he dead?  He's definitely dead.  His head tweets you.  You guys keep talking.  I'm cold.  This is going to be worth something.  That's his tweets.  I'm cold.  And they're always misspelled because he has to tweet with his tongue.  It might be the Golden Voice Ted Williams, right?  Oh.  I don't know.  Oh, probably.  What happened to that guy?  That was a fake account, too.  He's gone as well.  Bye-bye.  He's done.  Bye-bye.  Flavor Flav and Dee Snider swiping wives. 
[03:16:30]  Watch out.  Oh, shit.  Wait a minute.  What is Flavor Flav?  I don't know about that.  Niecy Nash and Tina Yothers?  What?  Swapping wives?  Wait a minute.  Wait.  Is she a lesbo?  Who?  It must be.  Tina Yothers?  It must be husbands.  Is she still wearing the fake sleeves?  Isn't it wife swap, though?  Maybe they're the wives who get swapped.  No.  Why would they say that?  Like, this is weird.  Are they lesbian? 
[03:17:00]  Maybe they're lesbians.  Oh, but Tracy Gold and Carney Wilson are also swapping out.  What?  Is Tracy Gold going to puke on everyone?  That's amazing.  Fat and skinny had a race all around the pillowcase.  Maybe that's what it is.  Like wife swap.  They go, oh, this one's clean and this one's dirty.  How will anybody get along?  Right.  This one is like, oh, Carney Wilson eats all the time.  Tracy Gold throws everything up.  Tracy Gold throws everything up.  What are they doing?  This is insanity.  And Gary Busey and Ted Haggard, the evangelical pastor, are the last, uh... 
[03:17:30]  Oh, yeah?  They are really scraping the bottom of the barrel?  Really?  Are you fucking kidding me?  Mick Foley is not the worst celebrity on this list.  I'm going to bounce you.  It's great for Mick, but...  You're bouncing people?  Uh...  Who got bounced and why?  Well, this, uh...  Crankster37 says they are really scraping the bottom of the barrel.  Who?  We are.  Maybe he was talking...  What if he was talking about the celebrity wife swap? 
[03:18:00]  Oh.  That's what I thought you were talking about.  Oh.  Oh.  He just got bounced for having an opinion on what we were talking about to listening intently.  Oh, see, I misunderstood.  See...  Watch your tongue in that chat room.  Can we go home now?  Nope.  Nope.  We should, I think, at this point.  One more minute.  Well, uh, actually...  We did good.  Why?  You guys still don't know what to talk about?  No, I wanted to find this crazy woman's Twitter account.  My stupid OCD kicked in at the worst time. 
[03:18:30]  Oh, well, I can't find it.  And is there anything you wanted to talk to me about?  Well, you know what?  I gotta be honest with you.  Yeah.  You know Christmas, right?  Why don't we start up music?  I thought we were just having a conversation.  Sometimes we talk over beds because the rock doesn't stop.  Ooh.  The rock doesn't...  Hey, it's Christmas time.  Uh, but at Rockland County's Lace and Stiletto, it's more like XXXmas. 
[03:19:00]  Come celebrate their Christmas party.  Thursday, December 15th, one party between two clubs, only three miles apart.  So you can get up close and personal with over 150 of the hottest, sexiest girls in the tri-state area.  Admission is free before seven plus.  They're going to be giving away a free dance every hour.  They'll be premiering more new girls than ever, ever.  More girls dancing means more girls available for your entertainment.  It's going to be more, more, more, more of what you want, want, want, only hotter, hotter, hotter, don't, don't, don't, miss, miss, miss, the, the, the, Christmas, Christmas, Christmas, Christmas, party, party, party. 
[03:19:30]  Thursday, Thursday, Thursday, December, December, December 15th.  That Lace, it's topless, at Lace, with a full bar for 21 and over.  And then Stiletto, oh, it's for 18 and over, where it's all nude. 
[03:20:00]  Both are located in Rockland County, just over the Taffinsey Bridge.  Lace is in West Nyack on Route 303, half a mile south of the Palisade Center Mall.  And Stiletto is in Nanuit on Route 59, four miles west of the Mall.  Check LaceClubs.com, LaceClubs.com.  And don't miss the Christmas party Thursday, December 15th.  I'm still on.  Leave those headphones on.  I know what you wanted to do.  We should take a break, though. 
[03:20:30]  This is stupid.  No, now we shouldn't take a break.  We really have to break.  No, because we've got live reads to get in.  You can't break now.  We've got reads to get in.  Now we're changing the plan.  I know the plan before was take a break, do more shows.  Oh, we should break, then.  We're not breaking.  Maybe we're scraping the bottom of the barrel.  I think he was talking about Celebrity Wife.  All right.  Yep.  Sorry.  That means you knew that it was a real comment.  No, I really thought he was goofing on.  I still think he was insulting us.  I think you're giving him an out.  The show is awesome right now.  I didn't bounce him, but I should have bounced him. 
[03:21:00]  Is this the best we've ever sounded?  Right now?  Yeah.  I mean, 15 minutes ago, I thought it couldn't get any better.  Nice.  And you guys both eclipsed what happened 15 minutes ago.  It's crazy, right?  Half an hour before that, I didn't think it could get any better.  But then it was better 15 minutes ago, and now it's even better now.  Nothing but pure talent right now.  Yes, I did.  It always gets better on this show.  You guys are amazing.  Yeah.  I just watch in awe.  Tell us something we don't know.  Plus, you're great at taking compliments. 
[03:21:30]  And humble.  So humble.  We're humble.  I think we're pretty humble.  I do, too.  I was just thinking that.  I think we're extremely humble.  Considering the amazing radio career we've had, we could be way worse than this.  Yeah.  It's just been spectacular.  Since we're doing our celebrity wife swap break.  Spectacular.  Which pairing are you most excited about?  I haven't listened to you for at least the last hour.  And did you have a favorite celebrity wife swap couple?  Oh!  I mean, obviously, I'm going to be excited about Mick Foley and Antonio Sabato Jr. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  What has he done lately?  Mick Foley?  No.  You're being excited.  Antonio Sabato Jr.  And you're going to be excited over guys.  Well, there's women involved, too.  Colette Foley, for example.  Yeah, but for some reason, you didn't feel like mentioning the women.  Because the males are the celebrities in this instance.  Tracy Gold and Carney Wilson are also involved.  Niecy Nash and Tina Yeager.  Is she going to puke all over everyone?  I don't think she's still bulimic.  I don't think she's still outside.  She doesn't have that thing going on? 
[03:22:30]  She was here?  Was she puking all over the halls?  I see some new stains in the rugs.  Is that from her?  No, there were no...  She was not puking.  Sir, could you get my truck?  Whoever you are.  Thanks, man.  That's Chris.  He's only been here a million times.  No, I know.  I was calling him Sir.  Oh.  Just out of respect.  Yeah, no, I know.  I mean, I actually have his number in my...  Yeah.  What about Gary Busey and Ted Haggard?  Oh, look who's here.  It's Ron and Fez.  We should just have them do the show.  Start their show.  Start their show.  Look at Ronnie.  He's a master. 
[03:23:00]  He just is fucking...  He's got a swagger about him that's just fucking like royalty.  Yeah.  He fucking knows how to move.  He's radio royalty, that guy.  Motherfucker knows how to walk.  He knows how to do everything.  He knows how to do everything.  Most people take that for granted, man.  You get a lot done if you got a good walk.  He's the best.  Excuse me.  I don't have a good walk.  What?  Travis.  Yeah.  You know.  A.K.A. Dr. Gay.  Dr. Gay.  Nobody calls you that.  Dr. Gay.  You're really trying to force that on everyone.  I don't know if it's going to take it off.  Dr. Gay. 
[03:23:30]  He has an update on...  Hey, people.  We're going to do Dr. Gay.  They call him Dr. Gay.  Dr. Gay.  Line nine.  Bobo is on the phone with an update from the DMV.  Oh, good.  Thank God.  Great.  Bobo, you got an update on the DMV situation?  Last week left you, you need a state ID or something so you can drink, not drive.  And that about sums it up.  I'm already on the line. 
[03:24:00]  You're on the line?  What do you mean you're on the line?  Bobo, not on the line.  All right.  I just arrived.  I just arrived.  Bobo, I just arrived.  Wait a minute.  You got on the bus hours ago and you just got there?  Yeah.  It took a while.  Why did it take so long?  Bobo, I think your punishment is very simple.  You came across like you might be a little racist and now you're at the DMV. 
[03:24:30]  I want you to make an announcement right now that you absolutely are not a racist and that  you want to apologize for anything that you may have said that could have been construed  as a racist.  That's a good idea.  All right.  Well, all right.  Put us on the speakerphone.  Put us on the speakerphone.  All right.  All right.  I want this nice and louder.  This is the last fucking time we're going to hear your voice on this radio show.  Because we can't have racists.  No.  No, I'm not. 
[03:25:00]  I'm not racist.  And you might want to give an example of something that might have been construed as  racist.  Oh, I think what I said about the president.  No, make me an announcement.  Let's not even bring up the president anymore.  Leave him alone.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  So put us on the speakerphone and let's do this.  All right.  I'm very sorry about what I said.  Wait, wait, wait.  Bobo.  That's quiet. 
[03:25:30]  That's quiet.  You're, you know.  That means you don't mean it.  Yeah.  It's insincere.  You don't mean it.  Should we just hang up on you, I guess?  Or are you going to do this properly?  Are you going to do this properly?  I can get Jordan on the phone.  You want me to get Jordan on the phone?  That could be great, actually.  No, no, no.  I really mean it.  All right.  Let's hear you really meaning it.  I really mean it.  I'm not racist.  No, you have to address the people around you.  I'm sure.  Go like, I am not racist. 
[03:26:00]  Right.  I want to apologize.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, I'm Jordan.  I'm not racist.  No, no, no.  You got to be like Malcolm X.  Like an announcement.  M-O-K.  I got a soapbox.  Say hear ye, hear ye.  Yes.  You got to really fucking sell this shit.  Hear ye, hear ye.  I'm not racist.  I was just making a joke.  What kind of reaction?  What kind of people are around right now?  What?  What kind of people are looking at you right now? 
[03:26:30]  It's just people passing by wondering what the heck is going on here.  Yeah, because you're not selling it.  You got to be loud.  You got to get their attention.  Oh, believe me.  They can hear me.  Are we on speakerphone?  Yeah, you guys.  Hey, Coons.  Hey, Coons.  You guys are on speakerphone in a state building.  Because you're on speakerphone in a state building. 
[03:27:00]  Ask him if he's going to be at the KKK meeting this weekend.  Are we still on speaker?  Yeah, you are.  All right.  KKK!  Wake up, white people!  Wake up, white people!  Wake up, white people!  The Jew is using the black to undermine white America! 
[03:27:30]  Football giggle.  Oh.  Bobo?  Yeah, I'm here.  Why are you laughing?  What's happening?  No, it's just the reaction.  I see some looks at my face.  Like, they're looking at me.  They're staring at my phone.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, you're like, who the heck is this guy talking to? 
[03:28:00]  You.  Talking to you.  They're looking at me like, say, who the heck is this guy talking to on the phone?  Shwuggie shouldn't drive!  Shwuggie shouldn't drive!  You all right, Bobo?  I'm all right.  We're going to let you go. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  You just disappoint us.  Yeah.  Don't get beat up.  I'm trying to get, I'm trying to get, I'm trying to get, I'm trying to get the, I'm trying to get the state ID.  Are you trying to?  You know what?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Here I am, Hope.  Yeah, I'm trying to, at the moment, all right, I didn't expect to be talking to a radio show while I'm in a state building right now.  Are you, are you, are you online?  Why does he keep bringing up a state building? 
[03:29:00]  I know.  Do you handle yourself differently in a state building?  He wants to make himself sound important.  Oh, I see.  I, I, I'm in a state building.  Taking care of my affairs.  I'm in a state, I'm in a state building.  I just need to figure out where the heck, which line am I waiting on?  Oh, are you talking to somebody?  Uh, find the line where they're giving out brains.  Uh, you're trying to figure out.  Hold on.  Excuse me, sir. 
[03:29:30]  I'm trying to figure out the right line to wait on to get a state ID.  Are you asking a colored, are you asking a colored person?  Yeah, I'm just, you're right.  I got to wait on the line for the application.  But Bobo, ask this guy, uh, put us on speaker and ask this guy if there's a shorter line for white people.  Where's the whites only line?  He laughs like the guy from Boardwalk.  Oh, that's even a better idea.  Bobo, ask him, ask. 
[03:30:00]  Bobo, go, white?  Where's the whites only line?  Yeah, just go, where's the whites only line?  I don't want to be on line with a boogie.  You want the American public company?  White power!  Whites only!  Sure.  How are you doing for crying?  All right, it's already causing a bit.  Shut up, you African!  You can't drive! 
[03:30:30]  Bobo, Bobo.  Yeah?  Please ask him where the whites only line is.  Every DMV has one.  No, no, they said, they said that line over there.  Are we on speaker still?  Yeah, they said they just pointed to the line.  We're on speaker phone.  Yeah, you are.  Oh, okay.  Just curious.  Yeah, you.  What type of people are around you right now? 
[03:31:00]  Yeah, what type of people?  There's just about everything on this line here.  Everything?  There's just about everything.  There's just about everything on here, all right?  You're right now hearing in the background.  Ask him.  We're on the air, the sounds of the DMV.  The sounds of the DMV.  We leave you now.  But the sounds of the DMV.  On the Sunday morning.  Too bad it wasn't a bunch of guys just punching them.  Oh, I know.  I'm trying to get them hit.  Bobo, ask them where they put their spear when they're driving. 
[03:31:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Just ask them.  I don't get it because I don't think the trunk of the car is large enough for the spear.  So, where do you put the spear while you're driving?  Hello?  Yeah, I'm here.  You going to ask?  Yeah.  I'm going to ask.  They're looking at me. 
[03:32:00]  Is there any Asians?  Oh, let me see.  No, I don't see any guys.  No Asians, huh?  No.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  People.  Who's in front of you in line?  Try to cut the line.  Say, look, I'm white.  I'm a white guy, so obviously I should be in front of you. 
[03:32:30]  I should be in front of you online at the DMV.  I am white.  I am superior to you.  I am white.  I am white and superior.  You are inferior.  Get behind me.  White power.  White power.  The security guys are already going nuts on me now.  I'm going to get thrown out here, and I'm not going to have a... 
[03:33:00]  The security guard's an asshole.  The security guard fucks his mother.  The security guard fucks his mother.  That guy looks like he isn't happy.  Tell him you only got that job because of his color.  Affirmative action blows.  You welfare recipients!  Fuck welfare! 
[03:33:30]  Get a job!  Bubba?  Yeah?  How are things?  Okay, this is like everybody.  I think you got the whole building's attention.  Well, it is a state building.  It's a state building.  Yeah.  That tends to happen.  You got the whole building.  I wouldn't be surprised if...  Bubba, why don't you...  If this is in the news, after you get your head cracked open, maybe. 
[03:34:00]  Bubba, why don't you make an announcement?  Why do you people need licenses if you're stealing your cars?  Oh.  Oh, now.  Yeah, I mean, it's a good idea.  It's not a bad idea.  I mean, you're just trying to learn.  You're inquisitive.  How do you people register stolen cars?  How do you people register stolen cars?  It's crazy.  I want to know how you register a stolen vehicle.  What's going on now, Bubba? 
[03:34:30]  Bubba?  Oh, no.  They're all looking at me.  I think every person on this line is freaking looking at me.  You envy me because I am white and you are black.  I am to be envied. 
[03:35:00]  I am to be envied.  Bubba.  He's laughing.  Bubba, ask him how they drive a car from the back seat.  You know, from the back of the car.  That must be strange.

It looks like a person of...  Well, there's two people.  There's one person of Hispanic descent, and there's one of black descent. 
[03:44:30]  Black descent.  Black descent.  I come from black.  All right.  Who are you going to go to?  I don't know.  Whoever the next person on line is.  Okay.  Right when you get to...  I got to get...  I just got to pick up the phone to fill up the application.  Well, you got to go up to her.  When are you going up to the person?  I don't know.  I have to think.  If you're coming up... 
[03:45:00]  All right.  They're saying I'm disrupting the other...  Shut up!  Shut the fuck up, you whore!  If the black person is the next available teller, can Bobo tell her that he'd rather wait for the next one?  Yeah, yeah.  Unfortunately, there's both of them right now.  I need the application for the state ID.  Yeah, make it snappy, you fucking cunt!  All right. 
[03:45:30]  I filled this out.  And what line do I wait on?  Make it snappy!  Serve me!  I'm white!  Serve me!  I'm white!  Now I got to fill out this application.  Bobo, are we on speaker?  Yeah, you're on speaker.  All right, lady!  Give me my fucking application, you bitch!  Freedom, I got to fill out this application.  It's freaking going to take a while. 
[03:46:00]  Then I got to wait on the line.  It looks like it's going to be pretty long.  Is he being sincere about this thing being on speaker?  I don't think he is for now.  He's not on speaker.  We're not on speaker.  Yeah, you're on speaker.  No, we're not.  No, we're not.  Take us off speaker, then.  Oh, you are.  It sounds the same.  All right, you're off speaker now.

[03:48:00]  Chang-tang-tang.  Bobo?  How is the person reacting?  How are they reacting, Bobo?  Uh, that's, uh, they're, like, reacting, but they seem to be involved in whatever conversation  those two are having.  Oh.  So they're not really paying attention?  Yeah.  Yeah, might be a couple, I think.  Who else is near you?  A couple.  Can you tap one of them on the back and go, excuse me, Mr. Chang?  Can I use your pen when you're done? 
[03:48:30]  Can I use your pen when you're done?  Did he say Chang, then?  No.  No.  Bobo.  He missed the entire joke.  Bobo.  Yeah.  Bobo, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta tap him on the shoulder and go, excuse me, Mr. Chang,  can I use your pen when you're done?  Do you think he can use your pen when you're done?  He didn't, he can't even say Chang!  No.  No.  Say, say, let me use your lead chopstick.  Let me use your lead chopstick.  Bobo, you're horrible. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah, you're not doing this bit well.  Yeah, but I'm trying to write at the same time.  Oh, that's pretty rough.  You're a real asshole.  I'm trying to fill this application so I can be out of here.  You're a racist.  Ask them if they know English.  If you know any English. 
[03:49:30]  Why haven't they fucking throat chopped him yet?  It's a man.  Throat chop.  That's what they're racist for.  They're so engulfed in the conversation.  My dick looks like a spring roll.  It's all crusty.  Could you get their attention and ask them if it's true that Asian guys have small dicks?  And then go, because I got a small dick.  But I want to make sure maybe that yours is smaller. 
[03:50:00]  Oh, no.  They just left.  Oh, they left.  Oh.  So who's next to you now?  No.  No one.  And I got the whole table to myself.  Oh.  Oh, well.  I got the whole table to myself.

[03:50:30]  He never.  I know.  The questions are so much better than him doing it.  He's such an idiot.  I can't have him do a whole, I'm out of order.  This whole place is out of order.  I'm not out of order.  This whole place is out of order.  Yeah, I guess he found that one funny.  He's laughing.  I kind of looked at it more as a throwaway. 
[03:51:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Something we could develop.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah, I was just kind of thinking out loud.  Thinking maybe there's something there.  Spitballing.  Yeah.  All right, look, I can't stay here all day with Bobo at Motor Vehicle.  You want to know a secret?  What?  I got you guys to stay even longer.  Oh, that's crazy.  Because technically you didn't take your break, so you could have left at 9.52.  I know.  I know.  I know that's the same.  We'll get this time back.  Rollover minutes.  You made us.  I'm keeping track of rollover minutes.  You're 28 minutes over right now.

Right.  Yeah.  What?  What happened?  Nothing.  Yeah.  Bobo, anything else you want to say?  That's it.

Can we hurry this, listen to me, before you start talking.  Can we hurry this along, I got some drinking and driving to do?

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Now we're talking to Georgia, and to drive.  Yeah.  All right, Bobo.  All right.  Let us know how it all works out for you there, Bobo.  All right.  You'll have these pictures when they get home. 
[03:53:00]  Oh, yeah.  We'll be eagerly awaiting your pictures of DMV.  Or we will have forgotten this ever happened.  Exactly.  Chop it up, it might be a good bit.  Yeah, we have a little ching-chang-chongs for me.  I mean, all day.  Gotta fill out the paper.  Yeah, we know, at the state building, right.  What's the question you're up to?  I'm still at the part where I gotta fill out the name.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  You haven't even put your name in yet? 
[03:53:30]  No, I was still in the middle of that.  Do I write Bobo, or?  I should write Bobo so they know who I am.  You like that one?  Bobo's got quite the sense of humor.  He likes the racy stuff.  He's a fucking asshole, though.  He's a racist son of a bitch.  You're a racist.  Thank you so much.  Bobo, thanks, man.  Have a good weekend, Bobo.  Later for you.

Well, that's what 16 hours of material means.  Yeah, I know.  But if you, like, tune in.  You know what I mean?  Even, like, even with 16 hours of material.  Like, if you tune in at 8 a.m. on Saturday and then 8 a.m. Sunday, you're not going to 
[03:54:30]  have the same thing.  Oh, okay.  Well, I'm glad.  Scheduling thing.  Oh, that's smart.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think we fucked that up on the regular show.

[04:06:00]  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  All hell was breaking loose a minute ago in here.  It's after O.P. and Anthony Live, and all the interns were all arguing with each other.  Sal was upset with Matt, and the Ron and Fez interns were making fun of, well, Matt.  He's just not a popular guy we brought up, because today we did Dueling Idiots, I guess,  is what it will be called, the Battle of the Dummies.  This is Steve Sterniolo from Raw Dog, who was just around the hallways hanging out, 
[04:06:30]  and I told him he could come in here, because why not?  It's Friday, you know?  Yeah.  What do you got?  It's a looser day on the after show, I feel like.  Plus, he texted me.  Every day is a loose day on the after show.  It's never been a tight day.  He texted me while the Bobo vs. Jordan segment was happening, saying it was the best radio  he'd ever heard.  It was amazing.  Just because it was a battle of two complete dummies.  And by the way, for those of you keeping score at home, you know we had Bobo on the air at 
[04:07:00]  the end of the show.  Once he got to the DMV, he was on.  What happened was, what's the other guy's name?  Jordan.  Jordan.  Jordan was on hold for the entire hour and a half.  After that bit, after his bit, and then we went to break and everything was done, Jordan  was on hold for the rest of the show.  I love that.  Now, I don't know if he hung up or the phone lines were cleared.  No, he must have hung up.  He did hang up.  Okay, because nobody would ever hang up on Jordan.  People think it's an honor not to be hung up on, but there are also those who don't realize 
[04:07:30]  that the reason we don't hang up on you is because we want to see how long you're willing  to stay on hold.  And Jordan, my favorite part was just listening to Jordan think.  Matt just gave Paul a look.  Oh, dude, because did you see your computer screen?  Oh, I see.  He was like petting the box of flowers and stuff.  You don't have to leave, Matt, but don't say anything yet.  What was going on was that Jordan thought that he was part of the show, and it was Anthony 
[04:08:00]  and Opie and Jordan, and everybody just kind of making fun of Bobo.  That's what he thought he was part of the crew.  Right.  You know, and like Jim was out, so you were much more vocal than, you know, you talk,  but you're much more vocal today without Jim.  So he thought, hey, it's me, Opie, Anthony, and Sam.  We're just hanging out, bashing on Bobo.  Making fun of this dumbbo.  Nobody likes Bobo, am I right?  Not realizing, it was like dinner for schmucks, where we just sit around and watch idiots 
[04:08:30]  be idiots.  And then I couldn't help but notice Matt, the intern, was in the phone screening room,  which is just separated by a pane of glass between us, or a couple.  It's soundproof, let's put it that way.  But I can see what's going on in there.  And Matt's just laughing along.  Not to say he shouldn't have been laughing, but he had the same expression on his face,  where he was in the Jordan camp of, you do know that you kind of fall under that dummy  umbrella, too. 
[04:09:00]  I wouldn't say that.  I wouldn't.  I think that every appearance you've had, and I like you very much.  I know, I know.  I'm your favorite intern.  Even though yesterday I caught him, he was making flyers, actually, on the SiriusXM computers.  He created a new sport, and he was handing them out, I guess, what, on campus or something?  What?  It's called...  Yeah, he was creating flyers.  It's called ice lacrosse.  Yeah, ice lacrosse.  Lacrosse and hockey.  Why are we doing that here?  Well, because I don't have a printer at home.  Well, Sam, I know you needed something edited yesterday, but how is he supposed to launch  his brand new sport?  Yeah, well...  I'm on my way back downstairs.  Oh, he called you a liar. 
[04:09:30]  Why?  Didn't he call him a liar?  What did he call him?  He made fun of him.  Wow.  Sturneolo, you are a stern shit.  He really called you a liar before...  Tell fucking Roland the truth.  It's not true.  During the...  Wait, wait.  During the commercial break, you said Roland's a...  What did he say?  He's a liar?  Sam said that Roland's a liar.  No, Steve Sturneolo said first, Roland's a liar.  No.  Never.  Actually?  Literally?  Yes.  Never said that.  Roland's a liar.  No, I didn't either.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Believe me.  I said...  Yes, you did say Roland's a liar.  Shut up.  Shut up, Matt.  I said to Matt, I said, Matt, you think Roland's a liar?  He goes, yeah.  Yeah.  And he goes, yeah, yeah. 
[04:10:00]  Dyer the Wimpy Kid told me this.  Yeah, exactly.  Dumb hair.  He called you an obese liar.  No.  See, that's not true.  I don't know.  That's very...  I don't know.  Matt just likes to talk shit.  You better go give that stuff.  Opie left his iPad and camera here.  God punished him enough by crazy.  God punished him enough.  Matt, you're pissed that Paul wrote a note to me saying Matt has no business in here?  No, I didn't know that, actually.  Why were you giving him a dirty look?  Why were you giving him a dirty look?  I wasn't, actually.  I saw you do it. 
[04:10:30]  Get it.  All right, you're out.  Why don't you go back and touch the pro flower box?  Because that's what you were literally doing in here.  I was coming in wondering what to do with the pro flower box.  To touch it.  To touch it.  But here's the thing, Steve Sturneolo.  And this is why you have to be careful.  Because Matt's not like...  Paul's fine because he's dealing with Matt here.  Like, if I were in here just kind of lingering...  He wouldn't say shit.  No, no, no.  And Paul wrote...  He wouldn't either.  No, no, no.  I'm not saying you should.  But I'm saying if I were in Matt's position as an intern and Paul wrote,  Sam has no business being in here.  Then when I got confronted on that, I would say, 
[04:11:00]  Well, what's Paul's business in here?  But Paul, guess what?  You don't have to answer that question.  Because he didn't ask you.  So sit comfortably.  No, I'm fine.  And Matt, you are dismissed.  Okay.  You are dismissed.  You're not kicked out.  Dismissed.  But you're dismissed.  Okay.  I'll talk to you later.  Why don't you go work on your flyers for your new sport?  Your brand new flyers.  What's the sport you're creating?  It's called your dismissed.  Sorry, sorry.  Go ahead.  Give me the mic.  Yep.  I turned it off. 
[04:11:30]  Is that how you do it?  You press buttons on it?  Yeah, I got buttons.  You just move mics.  I know.  You're not.  Steve, you host some stuff on Raw Dog.  You're on the air with Funny in the Morning.  Yes.  Which must be just a joy for you to do.  It's a great morning every morning when it's funny.  When you get a little funny in your morning.  That's my story.  Wait, so it's a joy when it's funny, meaning it's very...  Funny every morning.  Rarely in the morning.  Funny in the morning.  Sure.  That's on Raw Dog.  And, I mean, nobody's going to listen to it because they listen to ONA. 
[04:12:00]  The phone show.  The phone show.  Let's get away from my other jobs.  We talk about the phone show because Dom in Buffalo is feedbacking in.  Joe DeRosa says he is hosting a call-in show on the virus at 1 p.m.  Is this true?  Joe DeRosa tweeted incorrectly because he's hosting a call-in show with me at 1 p.m.  on Raw Dog.  Raw Dog.  It sounds like your booker, Roland, who was very kind enough to help me just reach out  to a few comedians because he's got a lot of contacts and he pitched the show and it  sounds like maybe he was a little confused.  But it's Raw Dog.  Serious XM Channel 99. 
[04:12:30]  Correct.  They get to be on the same channel on both platforms.  Most channels do, not us.  Yeah, it's completely normal.  Yeah, Jim Florentine, the other day when he was in here, said, hey, did you text me about  doing something for you guys on December 12th?  Yeah.  And I go, no, I didn't.  And then I found out another one who thought it was a virus thing, but it's the phone show.  Well, whatever we got to do to lure them up here.  It's like we get our listeners to come subscribe, but then it's our job to keep them here.  It's my job to keep Jim Florentine here when we lure him in.  Now you're doing 12 days of this phone show. 
[04:13:00]  Right.  Day one was yesterday and Amy Schumer and Jason Ellis came in and the calls were fucking atrocious.  And you get, well, don't, I mean, you know.  They were, but I feel like you should take some responsibility.  If the show doesn't work, it's the host.  Well, but what happens, but if it's all callers calling in and literally it's all caller driven.  All right, so what are you doing there?  I literally say Jason Ellis and Amy Schumer, you're on with Alan and Bob.  I do nothing.  Jason Ellis and Amy Schumer were the guests yesterday.  Well, they were the host.  You know, I'm just playing traffic cop, pal.  I'm fine with it.  Don't fucking. 
[04:13:30]  Dom and Buffalo, you're on with Amy and Jason.  Enjoy.  No, because you also try to, you try to get a little witty.  Okay.  Me?  No.  Yes, you do.  Yes, you do try to get a little witty.  I mean, if you're going to talk to me, yeah, but no.  You try to be a little entertaining.  I tend to disagree.  All right.  Jason, Amy Schumer's not going to laugh at anything I say.  No, that's right.  Amy Schumer and Jason Ellis were in.  I was listening to a little bit and then I saw Amy as she was leaving and I said, Amy,  how'd the phone show go?  She said, suck the dick is what she said.  Which I believe, she's being truthful. 
[04:14:00]  Well, it was, it was a, I thought yesterday it was a train wreck, but a good train wreck  and somebody won a grand, which is all that matters.  That's all that matters.  This is what we need to talk about because people were tweeting me about this, okay?  Uh-oh.  I'm not saying don't listen to the phone show.  I'm not terribly confident that most of you will, but I'm not saying don't.  Yeah, because why would you want to win money for very little work?  Well, here's the thing.  You don't have to listen to the phone show to win money.  You got to call in?  Yeah, of course.  Of course.  I'm not telling you to listen.  Call in.  This is why the phone show makes no sense inherently. 
[04:14:30]  There's, there's, there is no reason for a person to listen to the phone show because  why would I listen to other people try to win money?  Why do people watch American Idol?  Because people are singing.  Right.  They're doing something.  People are doing something, whether you like it or not.  People sit around.  No, no, no, no.  And they'll be like, oh, you know what?  That guy sucked.  I hope he doesn't win any money.  People are just.  Whether you want to admit it or not, you're in your own little world and I get it.  Whether you want to admit it or not.  It's just random people calling in. 
[04:15:00]  I'm not saying.  It's not people with a specific talent.  It could be Bobo calling in 12 times.  All I'm saying is it's people call in and get to do what they want.  That's just the premise of the show.  Whether you like it, whether you hate it, whether nobody's listening.  I don't care if you listen.  Just call in.  Why would anyone listen to this show?  Not call.  I understand why people would call to win.  Am I here to tell people to listen?  I'm here telling people to call in and win money.  So what's the point of having the show on the air?  Because we have to put them on the air so they can try to win money.  What other medium do you want us to have them on to call in? 
[04:15:30]  Well, I was thinking there are probably better resources for the money than to.  Oh, well, that's you got to go talk to the CEO and all them and the company.  I just.  You want to talk to them?  Let's call.  I don't think that they would like that very much.  No?  All right.  Well, that's who you got to take that up with.  But even you, Steve Sterniolo.  Would you host this show if they asked you to?  Would you do it?  Yeah.  Okay.  So my answers are your answers.  What are you getting defensive for?  I'm asking you about the show.  I'm getting a little defensive.  Now, you think I'm attacking you as a host.  No, I feel like you're trying to. 
[04:16:00]  The show is simple and it's a theory.  Is it the greatest show?  I don't know.  No, no, it's not.  You call in.  You try to win money.  The show doesn't make any sense.  It's not a good show.  But it's a good service.  Yeah, they get to win money.  Now, it's a good service to people outside the company.  There's some of us here.  Oh, so that's your complaint.  You're saying what you're overlying thing is, is not so much the phone show and people  calling in.  I don't care.  No, no, no.  It's where the money is getting directed to.  It's beautiful if listeners win money. 
[04:16:30]  I like the listeners.  Okay?  Apparently, you don't.  I don't have a problem with them winning money.  The problem would be when I'm getting tweets saying, hey, Sam, I heard, what's the day  of the big finale?  Because I know usually you do it.  December 16th, we're going to be giving away $25,000 leading up to that.  Are you still doing it every Thursday?  No.  It's going to be 12 weekdays in a row.  It started yesterday.  Okay.  And every day we give away a grand for 10 days.  And then those 10 people will compete.  We'll cut it down to five.  And then on the last day, which is December 16th, one of those five people win $25,000. 
[04:17:00]  And it's at 1 p.m. Eastern on Raw Dog.  1 p.m. East on Raw Dog.  And Sam, I think, you know what?  You need a raise.  Now I'm endorsing you.  And I see you from Raw Dog.  Now you're kissing his ass.  You were here 10 an hour ago, Paul.  Get out of here.  Yeah, I don't know what he's doing.  He's trying to jump in.  Didn't he get hired 20 minutes ago?  A minute ago, you were kissing my ass.  But when he said, no, you're kissing his ass, then he was kissing my ass.  I enjoy Sam Roberts on the radio.  Sam would admit that I helped to get him on Raw Dog.  Steve and I lost what a talent he is.  We work together all the time. 
[04:17:30]  Steve and I are on beautiful terms.  Paul gave me the mouth closed nod, like, okay, you got it.  Just protected my boy.  Yeah, just making sure Sam didn't need any back.  No, I want one of the listeners of this channel to win $25,000.  So tell them to call in.  What's the phone number?  8-7-0.  I was going to remember the phone number.  I'm going to dig back.  It's on at 1 p.m. on Raw Dog every day until December 16th.  And the last day will be $25,000.  How do I rationalize the fact that they've allocated, what's the final fee? 
[04:18:00]  It's $1,000 a day and then $25,000.  Right.  So how much is it mathematically altogether?  I guess if I did the math, it would be $35,000 because we're going to weigh $10,000, $1,000, and then $25,000.  So $35,000.  How?  How do I sit there and rationalize that this is what's going on?  How much do you make a year?  I have been specifically told not to bring that up again. 
[04:18:30]  Do you fill out a time sheet?  No, no.  I'm a full-time employee.  Well, I'd say you probably make, what, $80,000, $90,000 a year?  It's below that number.  I think I'm okay to say that.  Above $10,000 a year?  It's a full-time employee.  All I'm asking, what does Paul make?  What do you make?  I'm not in this discussion at all.  I've got a hotline call.  It's important.  Hotline.  Hi, is this money bag?  Get out of here, Rowan.  You son of a bitch.  Oh, God, who's calling in?  You know what I do for the company? 
[04:19:00]  I know you try to get people to call in.  What I do for the company...  I'm ready.  ...is talk about Argentium, Steve.  What is Argentium?  You know, because you listen to the After Show a lot.  Yeah.  So you've heard me talk about it before.  Steve Singer.  It's Steven Singer's brand-new collection of silver.  It's super silver, and it's made from Argentium, the king of all silver metals.  It starts at only $149, and it's more pure than silver.  It's sterling.  It's brighter than platinum, white gold, and sterling.  It's low-maintenance.  It's tarnish-resistant.  It's everything you could want in a precious metal. 
[04:19:30]  Plus, it's responsible and ethical, because it's made using recycled silver, which is a good thing.  Check it out now.  It's online.  IHateStevenSinger.com.

[04:20:30]  If your mom loves you, she'd call in.  Yeah, because I still am trying to rationalize this.  After Open Anthony Live is brought to you by Trojan Bearskin Condoms.

It's not your thing.  The whole concept pisses me off to no end.  So we have $35,000.  Are you above or below your yearly salary?  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  We'll be back on Monday.
