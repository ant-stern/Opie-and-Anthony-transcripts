<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, largely centered around Jim Norton's birthday and a bizarre lawsuit.  The show opened with Larry King's introduction, immediately transitioning to a graphic recounting of Jim Norton's encounter with Lady Gaga, involving explicit descriptions of photos and speculation about Lady Gaga's prolonged bathroom break.  This was followed by a furious discussion of a $5,000 lawsuit filed by Sandy Cain (initially mistaken for "Miss Brodsky"), who claimed damages to her property (guitars, cowboy hats, CDs, and unspecified doctor bills).  The hosts vehemently denied responsibility, recounting past interactions with Sandy Cain, including incidents where Opie broke one of her guitars (though he claims to have paid for it), Johnny Fairplay defecated in one of her hats, and other on-air antics involving her. They played a threatening voicemail Sandy Cain left and expressed disbelief at the lawsuit's legitimacy, citing its inconsistencies and lack of proper legal formatting.  The hosts' anger fueled the segment, punctuated by vulgar language and jokes about the possibility of countersuing.

The birthday celebrations for Jim Norton continued throughout the show, with numerous birthday wishes from callers and co-hosts.  The discussion also included a controversial breastfeeding doll, eliciting outrage and humorous commentary from the hosts.  Personal anecdotes and grievances were shared, including past lawsuits and legal battles, and humorous stories about Mel Karmazin.  A mysterious and unexplained flickering of the studio lights created a brief, eerie moment of speculation, ultimately attributed to a dimmer switch malfunction. Profanity and vulgar language permeated this entire section.

A caller, George, shared a story about a hutch and the night after his 19-year-old son's death from an overdose, abruptly shifting the tone.  The recurring theme of the studio lights flickering continued with multiple witnesses, including a caller, Corey. The show also featured a comedic bit about a controversial rhyme involving Fez, a coworker,  potentially leading to workplace conflict.  A caller suggested the flickering lights were due to electromagnetic fields attracting ghosts, prompting further humorous speculation and a call from someone jokingly claiming to be one of the hosts' fathers, denying responsibility and referencing Mary Antoinette.  The show included a song from the 90s, an audio montage of birthday messages for children,  and messages from the "F.U. Line," mostly about a jingle concerning "Bill Tetley".  A Khloe Kardashian update regarding a car accident involving Lamar Odom, where a 15-year-old pedestrian died, was contrasted with Khloe's seemingly insensitive tweets, sparking discussion about the Kardashian family's insensitivity and referencing Bruce Jenner.  Wrestling news, including CM Punk's departure from WWE and the deaths of wrestlers, was also discussed.

A significant portion detailed Jim Norton's birthday, focusing on the initial lack of cake, which was eventually replaced with a surprise Ben & Jerry's ice cream cake, leading to comedic reactions and further vulgar comments.  Roland's purchase and delivery of the cake became another point of discussion.  "The Virus," a recurring character, attempted to tell a birthday joke, resulting in comedic frustration. An Obama-themed joke ("Obama bomb") was played. Sam Roberts announced his street videos would be featured at MoMA, which prompted further conversation. The segment was filled with crude humor, frequent interruptions, and tangents.  Roland and The Virus participated actively in the broadcast.

Finally, Troy discussed his upcoming Guggenheim Museum appearance for an exhibit featuring his street videos from Myblocknyc.com. He detailed the website's features and the attention it was receiving, and mentioned rescheduling a segment with Otto and George. The conversation included more ribbing and joking about Jim Norton's birthday, his Comic-Con trip, and his Sirius-provided hotel.  Troy recounted an incident involving a confrontation with a child filming Lady Gaga, which resulted in online attacks from Gaga's fans ("little monsters").  The hosts discussed a previous on-air comment by Jim Norton regarding Ron and Fez, expressing concern about potential repercussions. The show ended with the hosts preparing for the day's conclusion.  Throughout the entire broadcast, offensive language and vulgar humor were prevalent.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, this is Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't that brilliant?  Forget it. The thing's out of control. Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard, you know what I mean?  So I'm...  Are you out of your mind?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to enjoy it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, you're good.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Jim Norton is the birthday boy. That's who Jim Norton is, Larry King.  Oh, guys, I almost forgot.  Happy birthday, Jim Norton.  Happy birthday.  Thank you.  I'm glad my birthday gift came yesterday for you, sir.  Yes, it did.  A picture with Lady Gaga.  And I'll say that the... 
[00:01:00]  Oh, oh.  I guess that was my gift, too, because I had as much to do with it as you did.  Shut up. You didn't come up with this one.  There were three separate pictures.  This was my birthday gift.  Three separate pictures.  One with the eyes a little closed and one with my eyes open.  And then one with my eyes in the middle.  Ah, there it is. Let me say.  You like that one?  That's the eyes closed.  Yeah, you look a little Chinese there.  Go to the second one I tweeted.  Oh, wow.  You pulled your pants down for Lady Gaga?  Oh, wrong direction?  Let me check out my package.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, that's a pretty good picture. 
[00:01:30]  The eyes are open, yeah.  She's got a nice hip thing going there.  Well, she's squeezing her stomach to make her hips look more shapely.  She looks really good.  And you got your picture.  Congratulations.  Happy birthday to you.  That's a nice pic.  And you're getting sued and we want to lose our fucking minds right about now.  But I do love that picture.  Yeah, we love the picture with you and Lady Gaga.  She has a nice legs.  But some asshole is suing us and we're about to fucking lose our minds.  I don't mind the Got Mule shirt in it.  I kind of wish I would have dressed a little nicer.  Got Mule? 
[00:02:00]  Happy birthday.  You could Photoshop that out.  It'll look like you just got a black shirt on.  Not am I leaving it.  Yeah, you can.  It's kind of quirky.  Two people like us.  You could turn it into a Lady Gaga shirt.  Two people like us.  Why are we talking about this when I'm about to lose my fucking...  Because I'm going to give you the douche chills before you do.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  Yeah, please.  What happened?  I took a nap yesterday.  A nappy?  And I dreamt that Lady Gaga retweeted me.  Boo!  No! 
[00:02:30]  That's the truth.  Who are you?  I know.  Oh, no.  All right.  You know, I'm...  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  Exactly.  I think Anthony turned me yesterday.  Because I was kind of caught up in the Lady Gaga thing a little bit.  Oh, who wasn't?  You certainly wasn't caught up in it at all.  Matter of fact, you just wanted out of this building and could care less or couldn't care less,  depending on the way you like to say it at home.  Yeah, exactly.  With this whole fame thing.  You just wanted out.  I have no ambition to see her or hear her or anything. 
[00:03:00]  It wasn't like a, oh, my God, get her away from me.  But, like, I just knew there were a gaggle of fucking people outside waiting.  And thank God they were on the other side of the building that I had to go through.  I'm starting to have a major problem with these celebrities that are really, really famous.  Yeah.  And I can't take it anymore.  And you kind of brushed the subject yesterday a little bit. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Like, no one was allowed to talk to her yesterday when she was up here.  Yeah, very important.  And as she's just walking down the hallway, she had all these people protecting her from what?  I don't even know.  Yeah.  And then, like, the whole picture thing.  You know, we can leave Jimmy out of this.  The whole picture thing.  It has to be set up.  And there's got to be email chains.  And it's such a big fucking deal to take a few pictures with the people that work here at SiriusXM.  And no one was allowed to take pictures with her.  We were all warned to keep our cameras down while we're in the hallways with her. 
[00:04:00]  And then she took a couple pictures, one with Jimmy, one solo shot, and one with the morning mashup because she did their show.  And she kind of walked through here relatively normal.  And then all of a sudden she went for her third costume change in the bathroom.  Yeah, yeah.  And she was in there a long, long time.  Big dump was the speculation.  Yeah.  Jimmy said a big snake-like log or something.  Yeah.  I was listening on the way home just laughing my ass off.  I thought I was just saying that out loud to myself. 
[00:04:30]  No, it was funny.  Oh, she must be in there just with a big fucking log coming out.  A nice soft toothpaste-y log.  And she couldn't cut it off, right?  It was just hanging there?  Well, the shit was fast, but the ass cool-down period took a while.  She had to sit there for a while.  No, what she was doing was getting into her I'm leaving the building outfit.  And this is what drove me pretty fucking insane yesterday.  It was the black veil like she was on some funeral march, right?  Uh-huh.  And we saw that she is relatively normal.  She really is. 
[00:05:00]  So I went downstairs, and I was ready to leave.  I'm like, I'm done with this Lady Gaga thing.  You know, I checked it out as long as I could.  And I went into the lobby.  There had to be 1,000 people in the lobby.  Yeah, it was crazy.  And I'm standing there like, holy shit, they're all just waiting for Lady Gaga to leave the building.  And I was with Ross Zepin, who he's pretty close with Howard.  And what's his job here officially?  He's the head of booking, I think.  Head of booking and some other things, right?  And sales.  Yeah.  And head of sales.  So I just happen to be standing next to him.  I go, Ross, why is she leaving out the front door when she could, you know, leave through the security elevator, we'll just call it? 
[00:05:30]  There's a way to leave this building where no one would even know you left.  Yeah.  And he looked at me and goes, she loves this shit.  Oh, yeah.  So then the elevator opens, and now the Lady Gaga that we kind of saw appear a little bit, you know, I'm not going to say we know her, you know, but you can observe things,  was a completely different person walking like this, I don't even know, like an art project, really slow and, like, moving weird and, like, robotic and strange and taking her sweet old time as she's leaving the building. 
[00:06:00]  People are getting trampled.  Paparazzi are getting knocked out, and, you know, I love seeing that, to be honest with you.  But then all the little things that were waiting for Lady Gaga, the little monsters.  They all got their camera phones out.  They're getting their asses kicked and trampled, because they're just trying to get a glimpse of her as she's leaving the building.  Look at her walking. 
[00:06:30]  Like, she's some kind of weird Muslim, I don't know.  Yeah, she's got, like, some kind of headdress thingy on.  She took off her pseudo-Nazi hat.  And then she leaves the building, and then there's another thousand people, and people are just getting pushed and trampled just so she could slowly make it to the car.  I don't understand this part of fame.  I can't even tell you how happy I am that that was on the other side of the building than my fucking car.  If I had to wade through that to get to my fucking car, I would be so pissed. 
[00:07:00]  Was that 48th or 49th?  That was 49th.  She walked right out the front of the building knowing all this shit was going on, because she loves it.  She loves to create a frenzy and create a tension for herself.  But when you see that, it does in a weird way make you understand why people around her are like, oh, you know, because literally that's what they deal with everywhere she goes.  But she could avoid this is what I'm getting at.  I was saying up here, it's already a secure building.  I agree with you.  You know, so anyone that approaches her here is already, you know, had a badge, came up, they're supposed to be here. 
[00:07:30]  It's not just like throngs of crazy fans that want to, you know, rip her hair out or anything.  But then someone wrote me and said, this is what she has to deal with every day of her life.  And my point is, she doesn't have to deal with any of this.  She chooses to.  She chooses to walk out the front door and create this frenzy.  I'll say the word again.  You know, she could have avoided that. 
[00:08:00]  I think she just dressed in jeans and a loose T-shirt.  And just left.  A hat.  And walked out.  No makeup.  Right.  It'd be like, what the fuck is this?  It's so calculated.  It's larger than life.  That's what she's going for?  That is what they do, though.  Yeah.  And it's smart.  It's album promotion, too.  That's what they do.  She's trying to get her fucking album promoted.  I understand.  I understand creating a buzz and all that.  We all try to do that if you're in the public eye.  But this is like just completely over the top and strange to me.  Knowing what we saw up here. 
[00:08:30]  And then she made the costume change to leave the building in this very unique and strange way.  She went into Gaga mode.  Yeah.  She wasn't Stephanie anymore.  She turned into Gaga.  What got me was hearing paparazzi yelling, Gaga, Gaga.  I go, what fucking world are we living in where people, grown men, are yelling, Gaga, Gaga, Gaga, over here, Gaga.  Really? 
[00:09:00]  Gaga.  Whatever works for you.  It was a pretty wild scene to check out yesterday.  The whole damn thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I saw they had an elevator waiting for her.  And I was like, wow, she's taking the front elevator down.  That's odd.  So I got down there.  And the doors open.  And there's just a fuckload of people.  Right.  I turned around and looked.  I'm like, fuck that.  Thank God.  I walked through the other way.  And there were still people on the other side.  And they were like, is Gaga up there? 
[00:09:30]  I just went, I don't know.  It's on my truck.  Leave me alone.  I went for a hack line, but I got a pretty good laugh.  I'm like, no pictures today.  I got to get home.  No pictures.  As I get out of the elevator, there's a thousand people staring at you thinking, you're Lady Gaga.  Oh, yeah.  No pictures today.  I got to get home.  And when the door opens up, it's like, all right.  But is that worse?  Because they were there anyway waiting for her.  So let's just say she did take the other elevator. 
[00:10:00]  Does she feel like that doing that?  Then they just stand there for nothing.  At least they got to see her.  No, they were standing there for nothing.  Because the photographers and the video guys, these guys are fucking animals.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable what they do to each other.  Just to get closer to Lady Gaga to get the good picture.  Then you got Lady Gaga security pushing back.  It is a sport, man.  Yeah.  That was the first time I've ever been that close to check it out.  And as far as the people that really are there just to see Lady Gaga, because they are fans,  they didn't get anywhere near seeing her. 
[00:10:30]  Maybe a slight glimpse through the people.  It was a throng.  Who else is like that?  I was going to use that word.  I was going to use that word.  Justin Bieber has that going.  I don't think to the effect that she does.  Because with her, it's music, too.  With him, it's just a teen sensation thing.  Yeah, yeah.  But who else is like that right now?  If the Biebs was here and walked out like that, it would probably be worse even just  with kids.  It would be crazy with kids, especially if they all knew he was going to be here.  Yeah.  I guess she tweeted a day before and said she was going to be on Stern, so. 
[00:11:00]  Well, yeah.  I mean, that started the whole buzz, obviously.  But, you know, she could have left it another way.  Is there anyone else that has it right now?  Or do you think those two?  Probably the two.  It's about it.  Maybe a Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.  Oh, yeah.  It gets crazy with them when they come to New York.  I think Justin Timberlake.  Timberlake?  No, not like that.  He wouldn't get that.  Not really.  No, no.  Let me think.  Let me think.  This is a really, really short list.  It's a pop sensation that's out there now.  She's a superstar.  Biebers is. 
[00:11:30]  Like, anyone with over 10 million Twitter followers, I guess, how many are there?  Oh, they do this for Kim Kardashian.  Do they really?  Yeah, they do.  Is it fans, though, or is it just paparazzi?  Probably a lot of paparazzi.  Mostly paparazzi.  Those are crazy young fans.  I don't think she actually has a fan.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  I really don't.  I don't know any of her fans.  Oh, fucking, what's his name?  Exactly.  No, no.  Fuck, tip of my tongue. 
[00:12:00]  Bill Tetley.  Bill Tetley gets this.  Would have just so many people out there, the paparazzi crying fans, it would be amazing.  Bill Tetley is ruining my manager's marriage.  Because he's such an OCD lunatic that he can't stop with good boy phone, naughty boy phone.  And he said that he did, like, an eight-minute Bill Tetley song.  He said he calls his wife's machine and he leaves messages that Bill Tetley wants to talk to her.  He's completely out of his mind.  And you're depending on this guy for your career.  He's just an odd genius.  He's an odd genius, but he's completely out of his mind. 
[00:12:30]  That's fucking funny.  We love Jonathan.  But, uh, so that was the Lady Gaga thing from yesterday.  Jimmy got his picture.  Jimmy got his picture.  But it was a project, man.  I'm telling you.  I just, I can't be bothered with projects.  I don't mind them.  The way Ross set it up, he had to do it that way.  Because literally the mashup did it.  She did a solo, and then she was going to walk, and Ross was like, hold on, how do we go?  Jimmy, how is that crazy?  But how you respond to that?  It's fine.  And you, you, you want to go through that? 
[00:13:00]  I don't mind, yeah.  That's fine.  I, I just know I just can't do that.  Yeah.  I just, would I have liked to have a picture with Lady Gaga?  Absolutely.  Yes.  But, but when you start have to emailing, and it might happen, when they, when they come  up to you, I think it might happen.  What do you mean it might happen?  She's, she's where I work, and she's 20 feet away.  Am I going to get a picture or not?  Why does it have to be a big deal?  That's what just drives me nuts.  A lot of times it's the personality of this.  They don't know what the star, the celebrity's going to be like.  Like, a lot of times it really is the one person close to the celebrity with a celebrity. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's got a little fan.  Yeah.  She's there with her gams, her fucking thigh-high boots.  That looks good.  Sexy, man.  Yeah.  She's absolutely sexy.  I turned the corner on that.  She's, she's good to look at.  She looked great.  She's dressed like Vince Neil back in the 80s.  Oh, she's putting her claws up.  Watch out.  Look out.  She was giving me a little claw.  She put the claw behind me, too.  Like, a little claw.  Oh, yeah.  Aw.  I was happy.  Oh, look.  Yeah, she's giving me the monster claw.  Yay. 
[00:14:00]  You've got your hand on her waist, though.  That's the...  Oh, dude.  What a couple we look like.  How was that?  Did you want to...  I'm very happy.  Did you want to just put your hand down her hip and that leg?  I literally, if she would have just said, hey, look, do you want to just leave your life  and come with me?  I would have just said, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  I would have quit on the way out the door.  That's it.  Leaving right now.  Okay.  I'd have to go.  Let everybody know I'm gone.  I'll be back next year.  I'm touring with Steph.  You know how sick of me she'd get?  My fucking awful body and my fucking horrible fucking skills.  Oh.  Oh, she'd give me the boot quick. 
[00:14:30]  What is the, what's the word on her with fucking?  Is there any attachments, any guys?  What's the, what's the poop?  Yeah.  There's been rumors of a boyfriend.  Yeah.  Anyone special?  No, nobody, nobody knows.  Just some guy?  Oh, it's a fake guy she made up.  Fake guy?  Well, I don't know if it's a fake guy.  It has to be.  I mean, it could be.  How does no one know who the guy is?  She's a regular.  I don't think he lives her life like this.  He's a civilian.  Oh, really?  And no one has been able to catch them together?  Yeah.  There's pictures of them together?  Oh, shit.  Oh, yeah.  There are pictures of her. 
[00:15:00]  Is there pictures?  Yeah.  And she's saying, this is my boyfriend.  I believe so.  Gaga boyfriend.  Let's see what a Gaga boyfriend looks like.  That's not him, right?  That guy?  No.  What's the Gaga boyfriend look like?  What's that guy?  I don't know if that's him.  Let's see.  He just looks like some guy in a local band.  Yeah, exactly.  He looks like some guy from fucking.  Come on.  All right.  They're kissing the third set.  Oh, well.  Is she with that guy?  Oh, a little kissy face.  She was then. 
[00:15:30]  She was then, huh?  Uh-huh.  She's a mystery, this Gaga.  She really is.  So mysterious.  She's just an enigma.  She's very mysterious.  Oh, well.  Kenny?  Kenny.  I heard secondhand that when she did an interview yesterday.  Yeah.  She told somebody she likes guys with long hair, rock and roll type.  Uh-huh.  And then she was asked if her boyfriend was named John Luke.  And she wouldn't confirm or denied.  And then she stated that she did get laid the night before the interview.  Oh, really? 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Was there cum dripping out of her little costume?  I didn't see any.  How was the interview?  That would have confirmed it.  I didn't hear it, but I was told just that she sang a few songs.  I know.  I wanted to hear them.  Stay on, Mike.  On the way in, it was confirmed even more that I think Club Soda Kenny is a robot.  Really?  He described this horrific scene yesterday that happened to him.  Did you hear this yet, Morris?  No.  Oh.  And I'm sitting there like, holy shit, where's the emotion? 
[00:16:30]  You want to tell these guys?  I told you it scared the shit out of me.  Yeah, but how you said it was like, it scared the shit out of me.  Wow.  Well, that's how Kenny gets the shit scared out of him.  You want to tell these guys real fast?  Wow.  It was a routine afternoon.  Hi, Kenny.  I was driving to the gym yesterday afternoon, and I was just driving, and I wasn't paying  attention.  Oh, of course not. 
[00:17:00]  And all of a sudden, there was this big fucking ass thud on the roof of my truck, and then  I look, and what happened was a tractor trailer was making a turn to an on-ramp of a highway  and must have hit branches or caught the wires somehow, which caused a chain reaction to pull  all the wires down across the roadway, which came down on my truck. 
[00:17:30]  Wow.  There was a thud on the roof?  Yeah.  And a dud behind the wheel?  I'm glad you're okay.  So what happened?  So, you know, I just pulled over to safety.  But you were able to drive away from the wires, right?  Yes, I was able to drive, because they hit the top of my roof, and I kept going.  Yeah, yeah.  So I was able to drive away from the wires.  Those heavy electrical wires.  Yeah, it was all power lines.  Power lines, correct.  I pulled over, and when the lines went down, you know, it was so hot and dry, it started two 
[00:18:00]  brush fires in two different locations.  Wow.  One on your head.  Where was the other one?  It was probably in his pocket.  I bet you, like, he had papers in his pocket, and he didn't know until he got home, but  it was on fire.  My pants are on fire.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  No, I called the police right away.  Oh, look at you.  Good Samaritan.  And the truck driver, I guess he had a fire extinguisher in his cab, and he jumped out and 
[00:18:30]  was trying to put out the fire.  Trying to control it, but it got a little out of hand.  Very dry out, yes.  Yeah, and it was two different locations.  Oh, boy.  But the funny part was, is all the fucking dummies that were driving over the live wires,  and then the people that got out to, like, gawk, and were walking around the live wires.  That's brilliant.  Yeah.  That's brilliant.  Yeah.  How out of control did the fires get? 
[00:19:00]  They were a good, maybe, 15-foot radius each of them.  Okay, you ain't putting that out by yourself.  No.  Maybe you with your shoes.  You should have stomped it with your feet out in a second.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  That's frightening.  Yeah, it was a very large, and I'm just amazed it didn't break my windshield or my sunroof.  What kind of damage to the vehicle?  Well, I got a couple dents on my hood.  Wow.  And I have some scuff marks on my windshield and on the roof and two little dents on the roof also. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, man.  Who's going to pay for that?  Well, the insurance company now.  Yeah.  Why is Mars laughing over there?  What's wrong with you?  It's not funny, Mars.  I was inconvenienced for 40 minutes.  I think 40 minutes.  Yeah.  That's a long time.  Yeah.  Well, by the time the cops came, they had to secure the scene and get all the traffic set up. 
[00:20:00]  Right.  You know.  And did you have to give a statement?  Yes.  Yeah.  Yes.  Good man.  And then the cop just took my information.  Marsy, why are you laughing?  It's not funny.  That mic's on.  Which one?  Which one?  You're like the engineer.  Figure it out.  You got control of the mics.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Hey.  Speaking is mine.  Speaking is mine.  How can you not laugh at his storytelling? 
[00:20:30]  I laugh because I don't even know if he shows emotion.  He doesn't.  Like, that sounds like a scene from a really cool movie.  And he's like, oh, it was inconvenience.  You are a cyborg.  I'm like, there's fires.  There's fucking power lines on your car.  I would have shit in my pants.  And this guy's like, oh, it just happened.  Yeah.  That's Kenny.  Kenny's seen it all over the years.  Come on.  You can't sweat the small stuff.  No, no.  You've seen some shit over the years.  You can't make mountains out of molehills.  Or that. 
[00:21:00]  You know, it was just a fucking inconvenience for me.  Very inconvenient.  You know, and two weeks ago, I had another fucking accident.  Jesus.  What was that one about?  Going into the Lincoln Tunnel.  Uh-huh.  You know, and there's two turning lanes.  And this truck, box truck, was driving very aggressively coming up on my right-hand side.  And passed me on the right, and then, you know, went to make the turn and, like, cut me off. 
[00:21:30]  And, you know, the angle of the truck, I knew he was going to fucking, like, hit me.  So I had to stop short, and he just clipped my right front end.  That's the, uh, because, yeah, the wheels of the truck go round and round.  Yeah.  Now, they're a little further forward than the absolute back of the truck.  Right.  So when they turn, it pivots.  Yeah.  So you're saying it pivoted and hit your truck.  Yeah.  Or your vehicle.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, so, so, like, I saw it coming.  So now, so I pull up, and I cut the truck driver off to stop him. 
[00:22:00]  Good man.  Right?  And.  Want to have a discussion with him about it?  Yeah.  As soon as I got, I got out, I go, you hit me.  He's like, fuck you.  I didn't hit you.  Go, fuck you, son.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he wasn't from this country.  God damn.  Yeah.  Where was he from?  From a country where they grow sand.  Oh, right.  I think we could figure that out.  Good, good.  Yeah.  So, and then, like, he's, like, he's cursing me out, and he's, like, starting to back up, 
[00:22:30]  like, to pull around me.  And I'm going, like, what's my move now?  Do I fucking Reginald Denny, this guy, and fucking just rip him out and beat his ass?  Did you have a fucking planter, a potted plant you could have laid into his head, or a toilet?  By the way, does that not show you, though, about road rage?  Like, that guy had no idea who he was screaming, that Kenny has control, but Kenny is armed.  He's licensed to be armed.  Yes, it's crazy.  And he's a big dude.  Yeah, yeah.  And a fucking martial artist. 
[00:23:00]  It's like, he couldn't have picked a worse nightmare to yell at.  If he got out and decided he was going to, you know, start something with Kenny by intimidation,  you know, he could have gotten laid out.  He's even-tempered.  Right.  Even-tempered.  I'm easygoing.  Thank God.  You're not easygoing.  He's easygoing.  You're dead.  He's dead inside?  Yes.  You're soulless.  So I figured, you know, so we're right around the corner from the Lincoln Tunnel.  There's always Port Authority cops in the mouth of the tunnel there.  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  So I said, fuck it.  I grabbed the guy's plate, and I said, as soon as we get around the corner, I'll just  cut him off and stop him again and grab a Port Authority cop.  Yeah, good move.  And that's what I did.  Was he all mad when he cut him off again?  Well, no, like the cops came over, and that's probably when the guy got mad because he knew  he got caught.  Yeah.  But it's like, you know, so the cop's like, just give me your stuff, and we'll get you  out of here because this guy's a little irate.  I go, yeah, because he's fucking got caught. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, he sure is.  Did you want to punch him?  I wanted to fucking rip his mustache off his face.  Kenny wants to punch everybody, though.  I know.  What holds Kenny back, you think?  Because there's a lot of guys that would go a lot further than Kenny did.  I guess when you're a cop, you have to learn to control yourself because you're armed and  you have a nightstick and mace and you just can't?  I don't know.  I think he's a lot more mellow now, probably, than when he was an officer.  No?  I think he was all jacked up, all hyped up on adrenaline on the job. 
[00:24:30]  Now I think it's a fear of probably prison and litigation.  Kenny, comment?  We do live in a very litigious society.  Well, we sure do.  We certainly do.  I'm holding my fucking little, whatever they fucking call these.  Kenny.  Yes, sir.  So you're okay?  Two accidents in a week, week and a half?  Yeah, it's just fucking inconvenience for me. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, it is.  Have you noticed any superpowers today with the power lines on your car?  I'm thinking you might be a superhero.  Oh, that's true.  It might be like Batman or something.  I'm still as stupid as I always am.  Nothing?  He's a stupid man.  Your vision didn't get better?  Nothing.  Your reasoning skills didn't get better?  Your OCD didn't get better?  I do have deductive reasoning.  You know what, I think you might be a superhero, because look at the suit color today, Jimmy. 
[00:25:30]  Shoe and roll black, please.  Yes.  Do you have anything that matches an urn?  It's better than the booger colored one.  Yeah, the vomit colored one.  He's got a booger color.  He's got a vomit color.  You've got to wear lighter colors for the summer collection.  Kenny's very fashionable.  He's got the worst summer collection ever.  He's fashionable.  Ever.  I buy cheap suits.  He wears a suit every day.  Yes, he does.  Who are you trying to show respect to? 
[00:26:00]  Unless it's travel day with Jimmy.  On travel day, you always know.  And he looks all casual.  Kenny's all loosey-goosey.  Yes.  Then he comes in with his big boy jeans.  Yeah, his big boy jeans and his little collared golf-type shirt.  Looking comfy.  It's Kenny cool.  Yeah.  Kenny cool.  Yeah.  But I don't want to distract from Jimmy's birthday.  Yay!  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Jimmy's birthday.  What birthday song you want today?  No, how could anyone forget when it's really your birthday? 
[00:26:30]  What's your favorite birthday song?  I don't know.  I like all of them.  I think they should all be played in a row, in a loop.  That's fine.  We'll get the fuck out of here.  Are you getting a Van Heusen sweater?  I don't know.  My parents would probably just send me a card.  I cannot forget that story now.  I don't think they'll ever do it again.  I'll never forget that, though.  Like, if somebody...  It's their birthday, and someone gets them a sweater, I always think of that goddamn story.  Van Heusen.  Because Van Heusen has to be the worst sweater. 
[00:27:00]  It's terrible.  It's terrible.  Year after year, I'll get Van Heusen sweaters.  I don't know what I'm going to get this year.  Yeah?  No, I don't know.  I know that there's going to be special treats all over the building, so everywhere I go, I've just been walking in like, I'm here!  Yes.  Hello!  Hi!  Well, what a surprise!  Wow.  You got your Gaga picture, that's good.  I did, that was nice, yeah.  That's a good start to the birthday celebration. 
[00:27:30]  Yes, it was a wonderful start.  This is great.  So we're getting...  I want to say hi to Miss Brodsky.  Yeah, we're getting sued, I guess.  By a one Miss Brodsky.  Brodsky, that's the doctor from Clockwork Orange, Dr. Brodsky.  Dr. Brodsky.  And now the lawyers are panicking, I can't believe they're talking about this, fuck you.  Oh, I don't give a shit at this point.  I really...  I've had it.  Every time someone drops you a fucking summon, subpoena, what the other fuck.  I've had it.  Everyone's like, well, here's what you do, you don't talk about it, you don't do anything. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, really?  Fuck this.  Fuck this, fuck this bitch.  I gotta talk about that.  Does anybody know who Miss Brodsky is?  Huh?  Huh?  Anyone?  Let me look, let me look.  You want to give some clues?  Any clue is a dead giveaway.  Well, what this person is suing for.  Oh, okay.  That's a good clue.  And then we'll see if anyone can figure out...  All right, we'll go for a dollar value first.  Okay, this person...  The dollar value.  Judgment in the court against you for $5,000, ladies and gentlemen. 
[00:28:30]  $5,000, together with the cost upon the following claims.  Action to recover monies.  Action to hate when they call...  Just call it money.  Monies.  Monies.  Why can't they just write in plain English?  It's pussy legal.  Why does it have to...  No, why?  So we can't figure it out.  Of course.  And they'll just say... 
[00:29:00]  So the lawyers know what they're talking about, and everyone else has to stay the fuck out of it.  Same reason tax codes are a certain way, it's absolutely why.  Right.  Monies.  So far, nobody has...  Nobody?  Nobody's come up with the...  Civil court, huh?  Right name.  This is a civil suit.  Yes.  Civil case.  Monies arising out of the loss of property due to defendants' negligence.  So wait, that's...  Me and you were negligent?  We were negligent.  To the Sandra K. Brodsky?  Let me just do this... 
[00:29:30]  For $5,000.  To somebody.  I'm seeing somebody with the proper answer.  Yes, yes, negligence for the cost here of two guitars, two cowboy hats, CDs, no number thereof, and doctor bills. 
[00:30:00]  Doctor bills?  Not medical cost or anything, doctor bills.  Yeah, there'll be a hearing.  Before the court, on this claim, if you think I'm heading to fucking 111 Center Street any time in my life again, you dumb, fucking, disgusting pig, you got another thing coming.  Ooh, I like that song.  Sandra K. Brodsky. 
[00:30:30]  Uh, you may know her more on this show, Sandy Cain.  Sandy Cain is suing us for $5,000.  Sandy Cain.  Making her the stupidest broad on the face of this earth.  Is suing us.  Suing the only show that has supported her over the years.  Yes.  Basically, because she's now suing us, she's dead to us.  Yeah, yeah, she will no longer ever have a presence on this show.  And all for $5,000 lousy fucking dollars. 
[00:31:00]  She would have got a promotion on this show that would have succeeded $5,000.  Yeah, so she could go in Times Square with her nasty, saggy tits hanging out and play that guitar as people, and I saw this the other day.  This is what I saw in Times Square.  She was standing there.  There were three people around her laughing, taking pictures, laughing at her as her disgusting tits hung down to her E.T. belly. 
[00:31:30]  She's a joke.  Yeah.  She's an absolute joke.  In a Ronald McDonald red wig.  And by the way, in that picture, and I saw her recently, too, she's still playing the guitar that I broke.  Yeah, yeah.  She's still playing it.  So how is the guitar broken?  Right.  A guitar, by the way, that I broke and then gave every single fucking dollar that was in my pocket that day.  It was plenty of money for a new guitar.  Kenny would know. 
[00:32:00]  It was at least $200 to $300 for a guitar that couldn't be more than $20.  Oh, it was a mess, that guitar she had.  And then she took the fucking money, pocketed it, and never got a better guitar.  I'm like, I saw this, and I'm like, what?  What?  Sandy Cain is suing me?  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Good luck.  Godspeed.  Good luck trying to fucking get any money out of me, you bitch.  Fuck off. 
[00:32:30]  Well, why two guitars, by the way?  Yeah, why two guitars?  I only broke one, and then I actually paid for that big time.  And it wasn't on the air, by the way.  It was a thing I did on the side after I was an asshole on the air.  Two cowboy hats.  She gave us one.  Well, hold on.  What's the second guitar?  Is she trying to say the guitar where I cut the strings?  That's just guitar strings.  That's guitar strings.  And all this was, by the way, publicity for Sandy Cain.  Of course it was.  Because there was moments on this show, and you're like, wow.  And then you know Sandy Cain, and it helps her dumb business. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  What are you doing, man?  That fucking guitar, I couldn't break, by the way.  Sue everyone.  But my shoes and glasses are falling off.  Sue everyone.  Period of damage is here.  If they play this video in court, I'm in trouble.  Oh, you're a goner.  You couldn't be guiltier.  That's the OJ glove moment right there.  It really is.  But she's still playing that guitar, so I might be safe.  Of course she is.  Adult.  If there's a lump on the clit, you must acquit. 
[00:33:30]  Yes.  With that horrid fucking thing on her vagina.  I'll stop it.  Is Kenny around?  Is there any proof that I even handed over money to her?  Because she'll deny it.  I'm sure there is on fucking...  So I would love to know what the other guitar is.  I know you're playing the video of me cutting the strings, but that's not wrecking the guitar.  That was wrecking some guitar strings that I could have easily replaced.  Strings.  And I'm sure I gave her money that day.  Because every time she comes around, we're giving her fucking money.  So fuck her. 
[00:34:00]  We give her a few bucks here, a few bucks there.  This lawsuit.  Plus all the publicity on this show.  We've pushed a lot of people to Times Square to go see her.  I don't even see a lawyer on this.  She like did it herself.  Did she really?  And filed it.  I also don't see any legal seal on this, by the way.  Doesn't the county clerk have to put a seal on this?  I don't know.  And where's the certified mail actually coming from?  It says small claims, civil court. 
[00:34:30]  Well, I would like...  Small claims court.  I would like to know why SiriusXM decided to sign for this, by the way.  Yeah, they signed for it.  Thanks.  You signed for something that was obviously a lawsuit.  Why did you make it so easy for her to drop this off to us?  Yeah.  Seriously.  Why are you signing for my fucking personal mail here?  Carol Alt, chief clerk.  That's a supermodel.  How about that?  Nice.  Boy, how she's fallen. 
[00:35:00]  She's now the county clerk.  So shouldn't there be a seal on this?  I don't know.  We could try to find out.  Shouldn't it be like, I don't know, notarized or something?  Who knows more about this?  Did we destroy two of her guitars?  And I would say that it's possibly one guitar that she's still playing that I paid for that she chose to not replace.  CDs.  Hold on.  Let's go through the whole thing.  Where's the other guitar, first of all?  You destroyed one guitar.  Does anyone have any info or remember another guitar in this whole scenario? 
[00:35:30]  You definitely didn't.  You cut the strings one day, and then a couple years later, you smashed the guitar.  I hope they don't show this video in court.  Yeah, maybe I should.  What are we, just throwing garbage on her?  Well, there's a video called Sandy Kane gets ritualistically abused on Opie and Anthony.  Well, she comes in for it.  That's her gig.  And you know what?  I'll say it again.  We're having fun with this, but this helps Sandy Kane's business.  No one knew who she really was before she started doing our show many years ago.  As a matter of fact, every time she's spoken to me, every time she's come on the show, 
[00:36:00]  she always mentions how many Opie and Anthony fans come up to her entire square.  What are we spilling on her?  Yogurt?  Coffee?  What is that?  That's gravy, actually.  Gravy.  A little gravy.  Didn't we just dump the whole garbage can on top of her head, too?  Yeah, that's correct.  On her stupid wig.  All right.  So unless someone comes forward, there's not even a second guitarist.  There is no second guitarist.  She's lying in her lawsuit.  No.  Now we go to the two hats.  We know about the one hat, and I have nothing to do with that one. 
[00:36:30]  She gave us a hat, one of the hats.  She left it here for us.  She left it here?  Yeah, left it here for us, and I took it to the range and blasted it with a rifle.  Shot her hat.  I took target practice with Sandy Kane's hat with various caliber weaponry.  Yes.  Yeah.  So that's all on you, sir.  Oh, really?  By the way, someone's saying she played the guitar that I smashed on her America's Got Talent appearance.  Yeah.  She only has the one guitar.  That definitely is the same guitar. 
[00:37:00]  She didn't take the money that you gave her and buy a new guitar with it.  No.  That's her problem, not yours.  And she brought it on a national TV show, so obviously the guitar is still in good shape.  She was able to use it.  Yeah, she used it every day.  Oh, boy.  There's the hat with a lot of holes in it.  There's a hat with all the holes in it.  She doesn't use the hat anymore.  Yeah, that would be funny, though.  A hat with a bunch of old bullet holes in it.  Mm-hmm.  It's good.  Why doesn't she use that hat?  Now it's a famous hat.  It's fine.  That's a famous hat.  It's a bullet point in it.  Amount to $5,000 for a piece of shit old guitar that you could buy at a thrift store for $10. 
[00:37:30]  This will get back to her.  You're stupid.  That's a dumb hat.  So she's suing for the two guitars, even though there was only one guitar in play.  Two cowboy hats.  That's questionable as well.  Now we move on to CDs.  What did we do to our CDs except promote the dumb thing?  She gave us the CDs.  They were never on loan.  But I never smashed one of her CDs.  I know.  What?  We played them? 
[00:38:00]  That was damaging?  Okay.  I'll go with that.  Damaging to a lot of ears out there.  You might have broken one of her CDs, but they were promo CDs that she gave you.  They were on her property.  Right.  Like she said, here, you can take a CD of mine, and then if you want to break it or throw it in the garbage, that's up to you.  Ugh.  But it might have been three CDs.  I have no recollection that we did anything with her CDs.  What a piece of shit.  Unless, like you said, it was a promotional copy, and then maybe I did my dumb hacky bit and smashed it out of me.  Here's her deal.  She fucking sued the naked cowboy, just for the right to stand in Times Square looking like a fucking disaster. 
[00:38:30]  And who supported her through that lawsuit, by the way.  Yeah, we did.  And she realized that it got her fucking face in the paper.  It got her publicity, and all of a sudden now she's not getting the publicity anymore, and there's only three people pointing and laughing at her.  And she thinks that now, if she sues people, she's going to make, you know, get publicity.  Well, fuck you. 
[00:39:00]  Sue someone else and get shit out of me, bitch.  I'm learning that in small claims court, you can only sue for up to $5,000.  Oh, yeah?  Hence, small claims.  How about that?  I wonder if that's why she didn't have a lawyer.  Who would take her stupid case?  Lawyers will take any case.  They are.  They're terrible.  Awful people.  And then doctor bills.  Yeah, what doctor bills?  We never sent her to any doctor.  We never injured her in any way.  I've never touched any of these people. 
[00:39:30]  She's never been injured on this program in any way, shape, or form.  If anything, we helped bring to light Twato, which could be a problem.  We had her diagnosed.  Yeah.  What's she talking about?  She should pay us.  We had doctors in here giving her free exams.  And just like last week, two weeks ago, I was walking through Times Square, going somewhere, and she saw me.  And she's like, Anthony, come here, take a picture.  I love you guys.  We're coming on the show. 
[00:40:00]  I gotta come back on the show.  I'm like, get away.  She's been leaving voicemails on my office phone literally as recently as a week ago asking to come back on the show.  Yeah.  Well, when was this filed?  July 14th.  She actually asked to come on our show a mere week ago?  Yeah.  Knowing that she was doing this shit?  Yeah, it was after the America's Got Talent thing.  Let's see. 
[00:40:30]  Evening, last minute.  I want an adjournment immediately.  Oh, God.  Only a judge can grant an adjournment.  The clerk cannot grant.  Oh, shut up.  Schedule time.  I hate this legal bullshit.  I'm counter-suing for the fucking damage done to my eyes and ears, listening and looking at that fucking dolt.  And sexual organs.  Yes.  When she flashes through your head and you can't maintain an erection.  Yeah. 
[00:41:00]  What about the threatening voicemail from her we played on the air?  Right.  Sue her for that.  I'll sue, sue everyone.  Counter-sue her.  I, I've, I've had it.  I'm not fucking stepping foot in that courtroom.  She's just stupid.  It's just a dumb move, man.  She's an idiot.  It's just a dumb, stupid move.  Get a real job, you fucking cunt.  Get a real job.  And by the way, you're a public figure now, dummy. 
[00:41:30]  I can say whatever the fuck I want about you.  You're an ugly slob that stands there in fucking Times Square and begs.  You're a beggar is what you are.  You're no better than the homeless that lay there in, in, in plastic bags with a fucking, a poor kitten in front of them with a cup.  That's what you are, a panhandler with droopy tits.  Go away.  We do have the tape where she threatened and said she would kill us, right? 
[00:42:00]  Yes.  Okay.  I think she wants to kill me, and was it Steve at the time?  Steve C., you want to hear a portion of it?  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  And I'm telling you, Steve, don't ever fucking call me again, or I'll kill you.  I swear to God, I will take a gun, and I'll fucking kill you, and tell Opie that fucking piece of shit to go fuck himself and help you all fucking drop dead, you scumbags.  Eat shit.  End of message. 
[00:42:30]  That's pretty intense, but she was on our show after that, by the way.  Yeah.  She was on our show after that.  A couple of times.  End of message.  That's the best part right there.  Do you know what a laugh that would get in court?  Oh, my God.  Not from the judge, but from the other lawyers, would probably fucking howl.  Shit.  End of message.  And she's called recently to be on the show.  We haven't called her, so now she's calling us.  We're doing just what she told us to do.  Not call her.  Two or three weeks ago, you're rocking me, sorry, in Times Square. 
[00:43:00]  She stopped me.  She said, when am I going to get back on the show?  I'm loving the show.  You guys are doing a good job.  Then she started calling me.  And a week ago, I had a voicemail on my phone saying, you know, hey, I was on America's Got Talent.  I haven't heard from you.  Blah, blah, blah.  Can I see her on America's Got Talent using the guitar that I supposedly broke?  Yeah.  Wouldn't that really be a good point?  It's like, wait a minute, what are you talking about?  You use this on one of the most popular shows on television.  Yes.  When she sends out her little mailers to people, she does collages of places that she's been 
[00:43:30]  and celebrities with.  Oh, it's horrible.  But she uses your guys' names, and she has your photos in her mailer that she sends out.  Oh, without permission to use, yeah, by the way.  Yeah, unlicensed.  She's on America's Got Talent.  She doesn't have a guitar, huh?  I thought I saw this with her guitar.  This is just a quick version, maybe in the longer version.  She's doing the I Love Dick song, by the way.  Changing it to I Love Nick.  Oh, the I Love Nick. 
[00:44:00]  Right.  Is Nick getting a fucking lawsuit, by the way, for ruining her feather boa?  Getting curly Afro hair in it?  Welcome back to America's Got Talent and a New York audition.  Who has talent here?  Being the host of the show means I get to be up close and personal with the contestants.  Oh, my goodness. 
[00:44:30]  But sometimes, things can get a little too personal.  Nick is my boyfriend, and I'm writing him this song.  I'm writing him this song, you tell him sorry.  Oh.  I love Nick.  I love Nick.  He's sweeter than the school.  He knocked off her head.  Yeah.  I love Nick.  I love Nick.  Here's the ice cream.  I love to lick.  I'm in a candy. 
[00:45:00]  I love to lick.  I love Nick.  I love Nick.  Give me a big ball.  Oh.  Oh.  I know why she has never a guitar.  Because I broke it?  No, because on her cowboy hat, naked cowgirl is taped out.  Oh, right.  So her guitar is covered in naked cowgirl stickers.  They don't want to promote that.  So they wouldn't let her.  Because they don't want a lawsuit from her or anyone else.  Ugh. 
[00:45:30]  Uh, let's say hi to David in Israel.  He's back.  Are you back in Israel, David?  No, I'm actually still in Jersey.  All right.  What do you got in this, uh, Sandy Kane?  Suing us for $5,000 because of two broken guitars, two cowboy hats, CDs, and Dr. Bills.  Yeah.  Dr. Bills.  Half this shit is bullshit.  No one should have a fucking cup.  No one should have a full of it.  Yes.  Language.  Sorry, Jimmy.  Happy birthday, by the way.  Oh.  Look at that.  Thank you.  Let's see.  Our audience is extremely loyal.  And they've been supporting Sandy Kane.  And I know, because I follow some of this shit, when people come to New York, they do search 
[00:46:00]  her out because they're like, oh, wow, she's from the Opie and Anthony show.  They see her play one of her dumb songs and they give her money.  Yeah.  So now she's going to turn the entire ONA audience against her over $5,000.  Right.  How stupid is this broad?  Go ahead, David.  I was going to say, based on her last name, she sounds like she's Jewish because it's Brodsky.  But, uh, the way she's acting and how she's fucking herself over, she can't be Jewish because  she's bad with money.  Oh, well. 
[00:46:30]  Well, wait.  Oh.  All right.  I'm going to punch out.  Defeated.  Yeah.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, brother.  Let me go to Jeff in St. Louis.  I found no problem with the hat.  Jeff, hold on, Sam, for one second.  Jeff, go ahead.  Yeah.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hi, Jeff.  Thank you.  You're very welcome, Jimmy J.  Aw.  Hey, that stupid bitch.  One of the last times she was on, Opie asked her why she was playing that shit guitar and  what she did with the money that he gave her to get a new one. 
[00:47:00]  And what'd she say?  I don't remember, sir.  I don't remember either.  I think she might have used it to go make them fucking piece of shit CDs.  All right.  I'm not sure about that, though.  But I remember you asked, you said, I'm going to come out of character.  And you admit it to giving her money to buy a new guitar.  Yeah, it was off the air, too, because no one wants to see the nice shit.  I do nice shit, but it's boring if you do it on the air.  Well, look, we'll get it out in the air right now.  It's not a big deal.  But Opie's been fucking Sandy Cain for a few years now.  Oh, my God. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, God.  No, don't do that.  What do you got on the second hat?  Sam might have found some evidence here.  Yeah, I did.  This is on her side.  In 2010, I guess, or 2009, whatever it was.  2010 is when we shot the hat.  2008, she came in with a different hat on and Johnny Fairplay shit in it.  That would be the second hat.  This bitch doesn't let anything go, does she? 
[00:48:00]  I forgot about it.  Johnny Fairplay?  Fairplay shit in her hat.  That's classic.  There's video of it.  Did he actually get a nugget out?  Yeah.  I mean, I remember doing it.  Because it's really hard as shit on command.  You really got to be ready for this.  By the way...  There's a little Johnny.  Nick, you're trying.  He's trying.  I got enough.  I need toilet paper now.  Can someone hand him some paper, please?  He's passing the hat around. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, yeah.  He's got it.  Oh, shit nugget in there.  Amen.  Sandy, how much to put the hat on?  I'll give you how much to put it on.  100 bucks to wear the hat?  Yeah.  20, 40, 60, 80, 100.  It'll be the fucking smartest thing that's been under that hat in a long way.  60, 80, 100.  Oh.  Put the hat on.  You're 100 bucks.  Not in my seat.  Not in my seat.  I'm a shitty hat.  I'm a shitty hat. 
[00:49:00]  I'm a shitty comic.  Oh, don't be silly.  The hat feels the same way.  Believe me.  Put it in a combo here.  Put it on.  Pull it down.  There you go.  Put the hat on.  This is what we're dealing with.  Put it in a little bit.  Put it in a little bit.  Put it in a little bit.  I am disgusted. 
[00:49:30]  By the way, pause it real quick.  Did you hear I just said all her guitar strings got cut?  Was that right there that that happened?  That was the same day.  We dumped gravy on her.  We cut her guitar strings.  Johnny Fair plays shit in her hat, and then she puts it back on to make more money from us.  That doesn't make her look good when I say, hey, here's 100 bucks.  Put the hat on, and she does.  That's hard to argue that in court.  And she just said she made $500 that day, so doesn't that cover the cost of two hats at least?  I want to play all these videos in court.  Just ignore that it says gets ritualistically abused on O.B. Anthony. 
[00:50:00]  We can change the title of the video.  These are public documents, by the way.  Yes.  Yeah, these are public documents, so all her information is on it.  Feel free.  Feel free to look that up, anybody.  Have fun.  You dummy.  You dolt.  And it was sent here to XM, SiriusXM, so I don't give a shit.  I don't want this to look like I'm just doing a bit. 
[00:50:30]  This is the, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  There it is.  There you go.  I want to save mine.  Why?  I'm going to frame it.  Are you?  Yeah.  I'm going to frame mine.  Mine's gone.  I hope he looks like Bobby Fisher when the State Department told him not to play in Yugoslavia.  Fuck her.  We did nothing but support her and help her out over the years.  I would love to know how much money we just handed over to her. 
[00:51:00]  Every time she showed up.  Ugh.  And then pushing our fan base, you know, to kind of support her when she was doing her silly shit.  Suing.  Enough with your suing.  We get it.  Oh, you got some publicity with that naked cowboy guy versus naked cowgirl.  And, oh, we get it.  Her Britney Spears makeover.  Oh, God.  That's disgusting.  Yeah, she gave us great radio.  No lie.  Oh, yeah.  But no more. 
[00:51:30]  I mean, you know.  That's it.  There's no idiot representing her from what I can see on here.  It seems like she just went down to the county clerk.  Uh, civil court in New York City.  And, um, filed it herself.  Because who else would say, you know, fucking action to recover monies arising out of the loss of property.  Due to defendants, negligence, two guitars, two cowboys, CDs.  And doctor bills. 
[00:52:00]  D-R dot bills, too.  It's not even, like, you would put medical, a lawyer would put medical bills.  What do you think the doctor bills are?  Who's Dr. Bill?  Yeah, Dr. Bill.  Oh, hopefully it's Kevorkian's protege.  Dr. Tetley.  He's not qualified to be a doctor.  He's a dermatologist.  Does heart surgery.  So there you go.  That was a great hello.  Yeah, that was a fine how do you do first thing this morning.  I open this fucking thing up and I'm like, what? 
[00:52:30]  I'm being sued by a fucking monster.  A fucking monster is suing me.  Ah, fuck.  God.  Threatening people with guns?  What?  The fuck is that?  I don't know.  That threat.  She lives in New York City.  I would check that out.  If she has a gun, that's a mandatory two-year sentence.  Sandy Cain.  Better look out when you make your threats like that.  Ugh.  Yeah, I want to hear that again.  Yeah, I want to hear that again.  Yeah, let me hear that. 
[00:53:00]  I'm telling you, Steve, don't ever fucking call me again or I'll kill you.  I swear to God, I will take a gun and fucking kill you and tell Opie that fucking piece of shit to go fuck himself and help you all fucking drop dead, you scumbags.  Eat shit.  End of message.  That's the greatest thing I've ever heard.  It's perfect.  Eat shit.  End of message. 
[00:53:30]  Fuck.  Damn.  I'm getting tired of all this shit.  I really am, man.  I am so just...  I'm getting so tired of everything.  I am...  Ugh.  Just ridiculous.  Had it.  Dirty D in Arizona.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, man.  Save me a pork.  Hey, what happened yesterday, man?  Lady Gaga was in the building and everybody turned into little bitch fanboys, man.  What's up with that?  Yeah?  Yeah, we were checking out Lady Gaga to see... 
[00:54:00]  I'm not a fan of her music.  A couple songs, they're all right.  Can you give any examples?  Yeah.  No, well, Jimmy, of course.  I mean, I kind of expected from Jimmy.  All right.  So what else happened?  Yeah, what else happened then?  You expected from Jimmy?  No, Anthony, man, you held out pretty good, man.  You know what I mean?  All right.  Yeah, great.  I'm so great like that.  What other examples are there?  Everybody else ran out of the studio and was kind of waiting in line with everybody else.  Waiting in line?  No one was waiting in line, asshole. 
[00:54:30]  Jimmy was trying to get his picture, which has become a storyline of this show for a while now.  So I was running down the hall to see what the fuck was going on and seeing if it was going to happen.  And quite frankly, I kept running out of the studio hoping that Jimmy was going to get dissed  because that would have made for really funny radio.  Sorry, dude.  What else you got?  You're too cool.  What else you got?  Yeah.  All right, dude.  No, I just expected more, man.  You know what I mean?  No, no.  You said that we all waited in line, and I'm telling you we didn't.  So what else do you got? 
[00:55:00]  I'm going to go now.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Later for you.  Exactly.  I'm suing that guy.  Nerds to you.  Nerds.  Nerds.  Yeah, but what the hell is that even mean?  It was interesting to check out the whole thing because it's Lady Gaga, one of the most  famous people in the world right now.  So there's an interest there, of course.  Yeah.  The Gaga.  I was thinking of yesterday.  Ow.  I really...  I kind of like the fact that I'm a fan of hers. 
[00:55:30]  I was driving to the cell last night.  Yeah.  Because it's like, well, I'm not that stuck in my musical tastes.  Like, I'm legitimately enjoying stuff.  Actually, I do...  I'm amazed that you do have quite a wide array of musical tastes.  Like, I didn't think I could like anybody new.  Like, really enjoy somebody new.  Yeah.  Like, a young pop.  I don't like pop.  Very rarely do I enjoy that shit.  What about, I like dick.  I like dick.  That's my favorite. 
[00:56:00]  We got a detective that says we should file a suit against her for threatening.  I don't want any connection to this fucking thing.  I know.  Believe me.  I wouldn't sue anyone.  I don't want any connection to this fucking thing.  I'm not filing a piece of toilet paper for this fucking bitch.  Fuck you.  I don't even know where my lawsuit went.  Desecrating the flag, putting it on that disgusting body of yours.  Yuck.  That was the cutting of the strings.  Boy, there is some video evidence against you, Woppy. 
[00:56:30]  What about you?  I'm clean.  You don't see me doing shit in these videos.  You don't have a video of that?  Of what?  Shooting?  Yeah.  I don't think I have it up online.  Might be at home.  Why didn't you ever put that online?  I don't think it really captured the moment.  Oh, really?  Yeah, there was nothing really exploding.  I got a picture of it.  I don't know if I have it being shot.  There's her holding up the hat with all the holes in it.  That's a famous hat now.  I know.  I would bet money. 
[00:57:00]  Do we have that hat still?  Yeah, I think we do.  Let's put it on eBay.  eBay.  Pay for legal fees.  Legal fees.  How much do you think that hat would get up?  Oh, yeah.  All shot up.  Be honest.  Be honest.  Ten dollars.  Five of her head is in it.  The hat that has a lot of bullet holes.  The hat.  Or so it looks like.  And pictures that I have of it hanging up and me shooting it.  So it's verified.  Right.  You know.  Can we put that on eBay?  Yeah, of course.  She shot her hat. 
[00:57:30]  She shot her hat up.  She really did.  And flung it out there and just took pot shots at it.  It's a dumb, cheap hat.  Who cares?  With a sticker on it.  It was a piece of garbage.  Look.  It has a sticker that says Naked Cowgirl.  It doesn't say that anymore.  There's a bullet right to the K and the E.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Look at it.  The top is where I was really bashing it away with the high caliber.  And then around the rim, I figured I'd go with some 9mm shots out of the MP5. 
[00:58:00]  So, yeah, that's nice.  Hold on a minute.  We're getting some intel here.  Let's say hi to Roger in Greenville.  Roger?  Morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, Roger.  How are you?  Hey, I thought I'd let you know that your buddy, Mr. Imus, was railing on about Big Jim's birthday.  Oh.  Big Jim.  He was talking to Bartlett and Powell and said, they got Jim Norton, then got Jim Norton, and look what I got.  Well, thank you to Imus.  Huh?  I said thank you to Imus. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, my God.  Yeah, y'all might want to listen to this clip.  It's pretty funny.  But anyway, just wanted to pass that on, boys.  Love you.  Talk to you later.  Thank you.  All right.  Rob Bartlett sent me a nice happy birthday, sweet boy text, wishing you a steamy load of joy on your chest.  Oh, that is nice of him.  Yes.  That's the perfect birthday gift.  It certainly is.  It is nice.  Ian, how long will you be in a bad mood?  I could see it.  You're in a very bad mood.  I'll be kind of in a pissy mood about this thing.  Just this, though.  I don't know. 
[00:59:00]  Probably all day.  Really?  This type of thing?  Yeah, this really bugs me.  It doesn't even bother me.  You know what it is?  This weird shit doesn't bother me.  I've had to deal with cool shit and shit.  There was that episode with, you know, that thing, you know, the divorce thing.  And then there was the other thing with the fucking, well, there's a few with the couple.  There's a few other.  And there was the thing with the morning guy.  There's not, not Howard.  Then there was the thing, you know, there's, it's just like, what, what? 
[00:59:30]  Morning guy.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That was way, way, years and years and years ago.  Was I involved with you guys?  Yeah, you weren't in there at the time.  That was for, yeah, millions.  Really?  Yeah, the guy wanted millions for some kind of anti-defamation, whatever the fuck it was.  I would love to talk about the other one.  Because that was complete bullshit.  Oh, yeah.  King guy.  Horse shit.  Somebody that, I guess we can't say shit.  No.  I don't know what the fuck that is.  You want to talk about frivolous. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  Can't say anything.  No, I know, I know.  But, yeah, we've had enough of these fucking things.  And then when some fucking disgusting disaster, this walking fucking disaster.  That we just took care of over the years.  Yeah, yeah.  I know that sounds strange to hear, but through all this.  Especially watching the videos.  But through all this shit we did on our show, all these bits with her, we took care of her.  Not only did we pay for her to do a lot of this stuff on the air, we gave her money off the fucking air.  We pushed our audience toward her. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  And then she turns around and does this.  She's really dumb.  Yeah.  Because she's dead to us now.  And I'm sure to most of the fans as well.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Fuck.  We got a Khloe Kardashian update in it.  Oh, yeah?  Want to do it after the break?  Yeah, might as well.  And I'm trying to figure out this Rachel Oocatel thing.  Oocatel.  Do you got this?  Do you know what's going on with this?  What's going on with Rachel Oocatel?  If it's true, it's the greatest thing I've ever heard. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, but I think it's not what you're thinking.  Oh, I know what it is.  I read the whole line.  Are you sure?  Oh, yeah.  All right, we'll talk about it next then.  Because I don't think she did that thing.  I think she was forced to do that thing.  Well, let's just say in general terms, it apparently, cunt one was forced to give money back to gifted person.  And that's what they say.  But then cunt one says no, that cunt two advised me improperly.  And cunt two says, no, I did not advise cunt one properly.  And I'm still protecting my right to be against defamation. 
[01:01:30]  So apparently that cunt one and cunt two have a disagreement over said monies from gifted athlete.  Okay.  And you'll explain further after the break?  I thought that summed up nicely.  Money.  And the Khloe Kardashian update's really good.  And the birthday party starts.  Remember, she tweeted that she has angels around her all the time.  Angels protecting her man.  That's great.  Maybe she could have, you know, gave a few angels to some other people in the scenario. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, that really needed it.  They really did need it.  We'll explain next.  First, happy birthday to you.  We've got some great ones to celebrate.  Celebrating on February 1st.  I think Jimmy's celebrating birthday today.  Yeah, Captain Jimmy Nordenberger, we're told it's his birthday, if you know Captain Jimmy.  43 years old.  Happy birthday from Steve, Sammy, Greg, Chip, Tony, and Uncle Paul.  That was a great one with Captain Jimmy.  Mysterious XM.  The virus. 
[01:02:30]  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Happy birthday to Jim Norton.  Oh, thank you.  Jim Norton.  It's my birthday week.  It really is.  Relax.  It's your birthday hour.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Hold on one second, because I just wished Jimmy a happy birthday.  I want to play it really fast.  Oh, nice.  And then we've got some shit to talk about.  You know, it's Jim Norton's birthday, Rob?  Yes, he's 43 years old. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, sweet boy, little Jimmy.  Those are guys really funny.  As opposed to?  Oh, no, no, no, nothing.  Yep, Opie and Anthony got him.  So funny when you do this, I'm in.  So funny when you do this.  And it never gets old.  Oh, no. 
[01:03:30]  No, no.  Certainly not.  Look what I got.  Does he hand out Valium to his listeners?  Wild.  That is a slow fucking pace.  He's just thinking.  I love it.  They get going when he does interviews and stuff.  Does he?  Sometimes he just talks and kind of talks.  Talks and.  Look, some people say that we have missed a step or two.  Yeah.  We've dropped a step or two.  Really?  We could go a lot further, man.  I'm pretty excited about our future. 
[01:04:00]  We can drop a step or three.  You could just be on the air and.  And.  And.  And.  Dude.  Some of this.  You.  Jimmy Norton's birthday.  Dan.  It was a.  Birthday.  That's what we just heard.  Yeah.  What were you saying, Ann?  I took a really long dump upstairs.  How was that? 
[01:04:30]  How did that work out for you?  Those.  This place.  Is unbelievable.  Did you go upstairs to.  No way.  Believe it or not, I am trying to bitch less.  Just so you know out there.  But there is something going on with the two bathrooms, too.  Really?  We have the bathroom on this floor, right?  Which we've talked about.  Ad nauseum.  Yeah.  Where you go in and not only have we seen pee all over the fucking place.  Sometimes you see duty on the seat.  Duty still in the bowl.  Every once in a while, like toilet paper on the floor. 
[01:05:00]  It looks like it's the Penn Station fucking restaurant, right?  I went upstairs.  Because that's where, you know, the lawyers and the executives and all.  That's where all the big wigs are.  There's giant wigs upstairs.  Have you ever been up there?  Nope.  Never been up there.  Their bathroom is, dare I say, pristine.  Is it palatial?  I think you could eat off the floor and the toilet seat itself.  A George Costanza-approved city bathroom.  Right. 
[01:05:30]  On his app.  So why is it that one bathroom is treated like shit and the other one is pristine?  I think that Sergeant Hartman wanted the one upstairs clean.  He wanted it so pristine, the Virgin Mary herself would be proud to take a dump in it.  That's a clean bathroom.  That is real clean.  When the mother of God will shit there.  Not only will shit there, but be proud to shit there.  I'm going to shit in that lane.  Yes.  You know, the next day we come in here and the bathroom is a complete wreck. 
[01:06:00]  That's a video.  Yeah.  To show what we deal with.  And then we'll go upstairs and I'll show you a spotless bathroom.  The contrast.  Dude, it even smells nice in there.  Really?  It's shiny.  Bathroom.  Have you ever been up there?  Never.  It's the exact same layout as our bathroom.  Oh, okay.  No, there's another door.  What?  There's two doors.  Oh.  Oh, that's the difference.  Keeps the riffraff out.  I saw Mel one time.  In there?  Well, he was at the urinal and I kept the, even though I wanted to stand right next to him  and go, hi, how's the stock?  But I didn't.  Oh, yeah.  So I stood three urinals away, you know. 
[01:06:30]  You got to walk out the other door.  Respect.  You got to think he's got a big fucking hog, man.  I wouldn't get into that.  I would imagine.  Why?  Anyway, he's bummed that we would say that he has a big hog.  I don't know.  If we said he had a tiny one, then maybe he would be pissed off.  I just kept the three urinal respect back there.  Yeah, you got it.  But I know what you were getting at, Jimmy.  You were looking for the peak.  No, I just, all of a sudden, he went to wash his hands.  Wait, this is a real story?  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Literally, it was just me and him in the bathroom.  I said, hi, Mel.  And he was like, hurlf. 
[01:07:00]  And then there's another sink on the other side of the bathroom.  So he used the other sink, and then all of a sudden, he was just gone.  And I'm like, oh, there's a door there.  There's no door.  There's only one door here.  Mel was always good with that other door.  The other door.  That's the escape scummy radio personality door.  Damn, man.  Remember that other door at the other place?  Oh, yeah.  We were in there getting our ass chewed out, and we kept looking at the door where he should  have arrived at, and we're like, I think we're good, man, because there's no one in this 
[01:07:30]  hallway or outside of this office or outside of this conference room.  And the next thing you know, it's almost like you don't even see the door.  That's what's creepy.  And the wall just opens, and there he is.  Got us.  The other door.  What's this doll about, Ant?  Oh, I was just watching the news there and saw...  You asked that question again?  Okay, go ahead.  What's that doll about, Ant?  43.  43.  It's a Jimmy's birthday joke. 
[01:08:00]  He's a doll.  Thank you.  Happy birthday.  Thank you.  If it's even your birthday.  Yes, it is.  I think it is.  He cries wolf all year long.  I don't know when his birthday is.  I think it's honest, though, today.  It is.  Pretty sure.  But see how you said, I think?  Yeah, I think.  I'm not totally sure.  Can you prove it?  I can.  How?  Look at my birthday face.  It really is a birthday face.  There's a breastfeeding doll. 
[01:08:30]  How do you feel about this shit, Ant?  I could give a flying fuck, but apparently people are a little up in arms about it.  It's a little weird.  Yeah.  This doll, it comes with a fake little bra with little fake nipples on them.  And the little six-year-old is putting it on there, as we say, strapping it on.  And then the baby goes, and suckles.  And she holds the baby by the fake titty, and it breastfeeds. 
[01:09:00]  But I don't see no fake titty, though.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, it doesn't put big titties on her.  It puts fake nipples on her.  Oh, oh.  Yeah.  Can we have Big A do exactly what we're seeing in this video?  That'd be great.  Big A do the breastfeeding doll?  Oh, that's great.  Like, be the breastfeeding doll?  We don't want...  I want him, like, shirtless, though.  So the doll just attaches.  Because the doll makes the sucking...  Yeah, yeah.  You want the doll to legitimately start suckling on his bare teat. 
[01:09:30]  It's up to him if he wants in on this.  I'm sure he would.  I think he should do this.  He'll do anything for the pogrom.  Where the doll just latches on.  Yeah, Big A, thanks for not suing us over the years.  Yeah.  We have beat the hell out of you over the years, too, my friend.  Oh, yeah.  But you understand the whole fucking game, unlike some people.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Can we play the commercial?  Yeah, what's the commercial?  I haven't even heard the commercial.  I've just seen it on the news.  The breast, they teach him how to suckle. 
[01:10:00]  For centuries, little...  Yeah, get it right.  It may just be a demonstration.  Find it!  All right, let's see the demonstration video.  Here it is.  Okay, here we go.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Maybe Glotan.  Mm-hmm.  What the fuck is this from?  This can't be from America.  Yeah, it's just a demo.  Oh, it's no audio.  No, because that would make it twisted.  It would make it hot.  It's a little girl.  She can't be more than... 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, she looks like six or seven or eight.  She'll be seven in June.  Oh, what's her name?  Annabelle.  Annabelle.  You ever do this?  That's Esther.  They're showing a nine-year-old girl.  You put on this thing, so you got, like, pink nipples.  Big pink nipples.  And then you got this baby, like, doing the sucking motion.  Sucking motion.  And then she burps the kid.  That is fucking twisted.  And she burps the little thing.  Is that to be a deterrent, though? 
[01:11:00]  Like, sometimes in schools, they make them hold a baby all day.  Like, this is what it's like if you have a kid.  Yeah, yeah.  You gotta lug it around all the time.  Yeah, but I don't think it is.  I think it's like, you know, be like mommy.  Mm-hmm.  Be a whore.  I'm just fucking angry at this.  It just annoys me.  Yeah.  Enough already.  Yeah, I know.  If you're just tuning in, we're being sued.  Sandy Kane.  $5,000, small claims court. 
[01:11:30]  Well, fuck yourself.  Supposedly two broken guitars, two hats, CDs, and medical bills or something.  I don't know anymore because I ripped mine up.  Come find me.  Come find me properly, and then maybe I'll deal with it.  I missed the bathroom break before.  Would you know if I just go?  Yeah.  Are you coming back, though?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  No, believe me.  I just gotta fucking...  It's not even turtling.  It feels like I'm holding back. 
[01:12:00]  Like my ass is the Hoover Dam.  There's gonna be a flood of cum in about two minutes.  Yeah, go upstairs.  Yeah.  No, I can't.  No, I'm telling you.  Just go up the stairs.  I don't deserve to shit in that bathroom.  But then you can see how pristine it is.  I'll tell you the truth.  I don't think I'll make it.  Oh, really?  Really?  I'm pinching my cheeks.  I had Mexican food last night.  It feels hot, too.  And man, did I just release all of that.  What do you mean it feels hot?  This could be dinty more beef stew.  Like a hot coral?  Tape it. 
[01:12:30]  Tape it.  I'd love to hear it.  See if it's worth it.  I'd love to hear your liquidy shit.  That's the level of entertainment on this show.  We're looking forward to Ant's liquidy shit.  Ant is really annoyed today.  Yeah, he's cranky, I guess.  Now that he's out of the room, we can talk about it.  But I don't blame him.  This lawsuit is really bothering him.  It's frivolous.  It's pesky.  This shit doesn't bother me, usually.  It's not threatening.  It's pesky.  She's just stupid.  Yeah.  It's just a dumb move on her part.  But if you're going to get sued, you might as well have it be for something completely idiotic. 
[01:13:00]  So you don't have to worry about losing it.  Yeah.  You know, it's not like there's a real issue there.  Even if she wins, even if it's a real thing, it's $5,000 lousy dollars that me and him would have to split, probably.  Right.  So it's whatever.  $2,500 apiece.  If that, trust me.  Because then they negotiate and all that.  And then for that money she gets, she'll never be on our show again?  That's really stupid.  No one's going to pick her up as a regular on a radio show. 
[01:13:30]  I don't know why she would do that.  Howard had one segment with her and couldn't stand her.  Oh, he didn't like her?  I don't think so.  He saw her as a goof, did a little radio, and he's done with her.  She was a regular on this show.  Why would she do that?  Why would you burn that bridge?  I don't know.  I don't know.  But if you're going to be sued, it's better to have something that will probably be thrown out.  I think Anthony said it, though.  I mean, she saw that, you know, suing the naked cowboy was good.  So she's probably trying to keep her face in the media. 
[01:14:00]  The media's not going to pick up this dumb, stupid, tiny little lawsuit.  I wonder if you're even obligated to respond because your legal name is not on there.  Yeah.  I don't know.  We'll soon find out.  So what are you doing for your birthday?  Honestly, nothing.  Why?  I'm 43 years old, man.  It's like, you know, life is good, but it's like, I just keep looking at what I'm not doing,  and I want to get this.  You're doing a lot.  I am, but it's not, you know.  What else do you want?  I want to have a show.  Things are good.  I'd like to have a show, a TV show. 
[01:14:30]  It'll happen.  Eventually.  You know, I don't want to be a fucking coattail rider.  It's like, you want to have your own thing and do that.  I don't want to leave.  I just want to have that.  I hear you.  And I can't, I work real hard on it, and it's fucking...  How close are you to that?  I don't know.  I mean, I've had very good meetings.  There's people possibly...  I just don't know.  It's like, it's all...  I hate it.  I told Jonathan to stop telling me people are fans.  I'm like, you know, the guy's a big fan.  I'm like, he's not a big fan.  They tell you that because you're a manager.  They have to tell you that. 
[01:15:00]  Tell him to, when they say that, to go, okay, name one thing the guy did.  I'd love if he'd said that to someone.  Because some of these celebrities, they say that to us, and I look at them like, you've  never even...  I mean, you've maybe heard our names.  You don't...  You're not a fan, fan.  You don't listen to the show.  You're not a big fan.  Thank you, Kenny.  Yeah, that is very overused in the business.  Yeah.  Yeah, and he falls for it because he's a nice guy.  Right.  He's a nice dude.  He's a genuine guy.  Right.  But I don't want to hear that shit about this guy's a...  You're not a...  If you're a fan, you'd be using me. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  Or if you're a fan, you'd be putting me on a roast.  Or if you're a fan, you'd be...  You know, it's action.  And you really don't think you're going to be part of that Charlie Sheen roast?  Oh, I know I'm not.  Is anyone trying to get you on that?  I don't...  I totally imagine not to.  I'm not going to grovel.  I'm 21 years in.  I'm not going to grovel and beg to be on a roast.  Let them ask for you.  They do.  Because that's going to be a big one, man.  It will be, but if I'm not invited, I don't want to be there.  It's like...  I'm not going to beg my way in.  It feels embarrassing.  I would assume most people aren't invited.  There's people, you know, working names.  Yeah, probably.  Over at Comedy Central. 
[01:16:00]  But it's like...  I'd use my guy.  Enough already with...  You know, it's been so many years.  They know who I am.  It's a good network.  They just don't like what I do.  What was the last thing you did for them?  The last thing I did for them was something I actually didn't want to do, but I did it as a  favorite of Mike DiStefano, who would...  The addiction thing.  Yeah.  I didn't want to do it because the money was so bad, and I didn't want to do it because  I knew that you can only do one thing at a time.  I wanted to do a special for Comedy Central, but to do something with Mike and Bobby and 
[01:16:30]  Voss, all of us being clean, I was like, you know...  So I didn't want to do it for that reason, but I'm happy I did it now, obviously, because  Mike's gone.  Oh, Jesus.  Absolutely.  I would have felt like an asshole if I didn't do it.  Yeah, it was the right thing.  Yeah, and the...  So that's the last thing I've done for them, but that wasn't even for them, really.  I don't know if I've ever really done anything for them.  I did Tough Crowd Stands Up, but that was through Colin.  I did Tough Crowd for two years, that was all through Colin.  The Bob Staggart roast was through Bob, but they themselves have never, I think, really... 
[01:17:00]  It's a really strange network.  Yeah, like, I never did a special for them.  I've never shot a special for Comedy Central, because I turned them down when they offered  me, because by the time they offered me, it was, like, way after they had offered everybody  else.  So I was kind of like, well, why would I do it?  You're just asking me, because I'm the next guy.  You don't care about me.  Yeah.  So I held off for HBO.  I just realized something.  What's that?  We're all having a Lady Gaga hangover today.  Too much excitement? 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, too much Lady Gaga yesterday.  And now this is the aftermath, the Lady Gaga hangover.  Not enough Lady Gaga, as far as I'm concerned.  Me, too.  I would listen to Americano today.  Yeah.  I do enjoy her CD, man.  I like it.  I made a video outside the building yesterday and kind of attacked a little twink.  Yeah.  I thought, what are you going to do?  I just don't know if it was necessary.  Why? 
[01:18:00]  I mean, after Lady Gaga left, there was this thing.  I don't even know if it was a male or a female.  I think it was a little girl.  Crying.  Little girl.  Huh?  I think it was a little girl.  A little girl?  And she was just very excited to see Mother Monster.  Right.  And she was crying.  So I had to put a video camera in her face and ask her, why are you crying?  Skip.  She held your hand and you're crying?  Let's go.  Come on.  Next destination.  What do you mean, next destination? 
[01:18:30]  What are you guys doing?  We won't tell you that.  I don't need to know where she's going.  Why would someone cry over Lady Gaga?  Because we fucking love her.  Why are you crying over Lady Gaga?  Stop criticizing her.  We fucking love her, right?  I'm asking a question.  Why are you crying?  Can you stop following us?  Why are you crying?  You're going to call the police on me?  Do you know who I am?  Do you know who I am?  Stop.  You're a psychopath.  He's just a kid.  He's just such a psychopath.  You should probably pick harder targets.  He's just a little effeminate boy. 
[01:19:00]  I was leaving them alone until they said I'm going to call the police on you.  I do.  I was doing exactly what they were doing.  They're following Lady Gaga.  I'm following the people that are following Lady Gaga to try to get the story.  I do like when that video turns because it comes out of nowhere.  It's just kind of you goofing on that white heart.  And then all of a sudden it's, do you know who I am?  Oh, Sam, that never comes out of nowhere.  Trust me on that.  It's always right here.  It's there waiting.  It's the psycho factor.  It just sits right here.  And it just waits.  I was like, when the guy yells, stop criticizing us. 
[01:19:30]  I'm not criticizing her, meaning Gaga or the girl.  I don't know.  I just think it's funny that you said that.  Is it a she or a he?  That's a she.  The, the, the, they're both she's?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  The guy with the short hair is a guy with the, I love New York.  And the girl with the glasses is a girl.  I think.  Right.  I mean, it could go.  And the comments are getting out of control.  People are like doing a whole gay thing and stuff.  I, I don't even care if these, these people were gay.  If they, I don't even know if they are.  It's about being obsessed with Gaga. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  I was confused why this, this, this girl would be crying over Lady Gaga.  And then we learned that Lady Gaga possibly touched her hand or held her hand for a split  second.  I understand that, that, uh, especially at that age, that emotional thing when you meet  somebody like you idolize.  I definitely get that.  Yeah.  And then they're going to the next destination.  And then the guy who wants to call the police on me because I'm doing exactly what he's doing.  Apparently he didn't know who you were.  I'm bothering him.  He's bothering Lady Gaga.  Yeah, I guess.  And by the way, for the dummies that can't figure shit out, I didn't expect the kid to 
[01:20:30]  know who I was.  That was the fucking bit.  Did people really think that-  Yes!  You thought he should know?  Yes.  Like you thought he should know?  Yes.  It's a joke.  It was a complete over-the-top response is what I was going for.  I would have thought that at this point people would understand that, but-  No surprise, the kid didn't know who you were.  No one knows who you are.  There is something about the internet and giving everybody a voice that seems like it 
[01:21:00]  shouldn't be done.  Nah, everyone should have a voice.  It's unfortunate.  Everyone should have a voice.  Seriously.  I just like goofing on some of the voices out there.  I don't mind the voices if they speak.  I just hate the anonymity.  I don't mind the voices or the criticism or the nasty remarks or the whatever.  I only respect the ones that use their name.  It's a weird thing.  This is not communist China.  You're not going to be fired for disapproving of a video from your job.  You can go online and go, hey, Opie, this sucks or whatever, and use your real name,  and you're not going to be fired.  Yeah, I agree with you, Jimmy. 
[01:21:30]  And then some people go, well, you're hiding.  Your name is Opie.  You're not using your real name.  Shut the fuck up.  I've been Opie since I was a stupid, tiny little kid, you idiots.  I think people know who I am.  Yeah, your real name is a public record.  At this point, my name's Opie.  It really is.  And no one calls me Greg, which is my real name.  No one.  I mean, no one.  Unless they try to get to me or unless, like, they want...  Your family does, right? 
[01:22:00]  They don't call you Opie.  They call you Opie?  Pretty much, yeah.  Lindsay calls you Opie?  She calls me, yeah, she's got some names.  Oh, did she...  She's got some names.  What kind of names?  She's got some names.  Wait, she doesn't call you Opie?  She's got some names.  She call you Greg?  She's got some names.  It's not...  Buttercup.  She doesn't call you Buttercup.  She's got some names.  What does she call you?  Yeah, what does she call you?  If not Greg or Opie, because that's all we know you as is...  Or Gregorio.  Gregorio's my favorite.  Gregorio.  What does she call you?  Maybe Buttercup.  Come on.  I'm not saying.  Why?  I don't want to. 
[01:22:30]  Come on.  I've admitted fucking trannies.  I'm shy.  Yeah, but she doesn't use my real name either.  How was that, Ant?  I wasn't able to capture it.  Because it was almost like...  Was it a mudslide?  Yeah, I could...  Okay.  It wasn't boulders?  No, no.  Rolling down a hill?  I could say it's like...  It's like, you know how they didn't get Mount St. Helens exploding?  Yeah.  That's pretty much what it was like.  Mount St. Helens didn't have shit and condoms falling out of it. 
[01:23:00]  What do you mean it didn't capture?  You had the camera.  Yeah, but it was like, oh my God, oh, sit down, sit down, sit down, wham!  Oh, it was one of those where you barely made it down?  And then you're done, and it's pretty much over.  Then you just got to sit and wait, you know, for the thermostat to cool down before you can...  Is there anything better than that?  The immediate just...  The immediate, as soon as you sit down?  Yeah, yeah.  You good now?  You didn't go upstairs?  No, no.  I don't like the classy bathrooms.  No.  I just like the regular trash bathrooms. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  Like downstairs.  Yeah.  So that was good.  You just saved me, by the way, thank God.  Why?  Jimmy's trying to find out some of my pet names.  We, uh...  Oh, you got some pet names.  I'm not going with the pet name bit.  I didn't realize there was a pet name, but he said that his wife does not call him Opie.  And he said, I suppose to call you Greg or Gregorio?  And he said, no, other things.  Greggy? 
[01:24:00]  Buttercup, which none of us believed.  Buttercup.  Oh, Buttercup.  None of us believed Buttercup.  Yep.  So now I want to know the pet name.  Yeah.  She calls me Squeezy.  She calls me Bunny.  She calls me Squeezy.  Squeezy.  Because we hug a lot, so she calls me Squeezy.  Yeah.  He's making it up.  Buttercup is Squeezy.  You sure she's not saying she's Queezy?  Why did I set myself up?  She's Queezy.  Why did I set myself up?  Fuck. 
[01:24:30]  Touche, my friend.  Touche.  You win this time.  It's usually, everyone uses, you know, hey baby, could you get me this?  Hey baby, I use a lot.  Hey there.  Hey there, baby.  Sweetie Pants.  You got pet names?  Hey there, Sweetie Pants.  Sweetie Pants.  You've been in a relationship a while now.  You got pet names.  Yeah, there are little things like that.  Little things.  You know, like a Sweetie Pants.  It's more sarcastic than real.  You know, you're kind of, hey Sweetie Pants.  I'm trying to think if I have a little thing.  Let me think. 
[01:25:00]  Let me think.  What do you call the trannies when they come over, Jimmy?  You got pet names for them?  Baby and Sweetie Pants.  Baby and Sweetie Pants.  Sweetie Pants.  Old Poopy Pants.  Yes.  Extra Treat.  I call them Extra Treat.  Yeah.  I'm trying to think if my chick and I had a nickname for each other.  Yeah, there'd always be those little fucking things that you just kind of say.  Because it gets.  Wait a minute.  I know we did.  You just say the name all the time.  It's kind of like.  I know.  Cont, Cont, Cont, Cont, Cont, Cont. 
[01:25:30]  We were, I kind of lost it on this little twink last night.  Yesterday after the show.  Oh.  A little psycho came out of my head.  He's just fucking, what is he, with his broad?  I don't know.  Probably friends.  Just little friends seeing Lady Gaga.  Well, she was crying and I want to really know why.  It's like a Sonny D ad.  The two of them.  Right.  We're the white kids.  Jesus.  Why are you crying over somebody?  The white kids are there?  You ever cry over anyone?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:26:00]  Sure.  Over someone famous?  Not at this point in my life, but when I was younger, sure.  When you were younger, did you?  Oh, mate.  How old is he?  I can't say I ever did.  No.  I don't think so.  I've been fans of a lot of things and people.  Someone's bringing up Roger Ebert.  Oh, yeah.  I stand corrected.  Oh, that was just a human emotion coming out that day.  Yeah, that wasn't more of like, wow, I'm so infatuated with this person as an entertainer.  I understand being into someone to a point, but then when it comes down to breaking down 
[01:26:30]  and crying, this is like Beatles shit.  Oh, oh, oh.  I do remember.  I did cry, but it was for a totally different reason.  Groucho grabbed your balls.  No, no.  I wish.  It was Walt Whitman Mall.  Oh, shit.  And I do believe that Batman and Robin were there.  But not the real Batman and Robin.  No, it was.  It was this time.  Adam West?  Adam West.  No. 
[01:27:00]  Yes.  How do you know?  Burt Ward?  Because it was billed as that and everyone knew it.  It was a huge crowd.  How do you know if it was someone just playing Adam West?  You could tell the way he was talking and everything.  Like Robin had the holy shit Batman voice.  And, you know, and he was like, great, great to be here, everybody.  But I wasn't crying because I was excited to see them.  I was crying because the crowd was too big and they were pushing.  You're scared?  So I started crying and I got yelled at. 
[01:27:30]  I was like a little kid.  When the fuck was that show on?  60s something.  60s maybe?  Yeah.  Early 70s possibly, I would guess.  And it might have been to promote their movie that came out at the time.  That horrible movie.  That bad Batman movie.  That was the one with the Batman boat, right?  Yeah, I think the Batboat.  Was it 66?  I was, what, five years old?  And I was crying.  And I had this.  And also I was very sad because I always had these expectations and fantasies of how things would be. 
[01:28:00]  And I actually thought somehow, some way, I was going to be able to bring our little TV tray and our little record player and play the Batman song theme music while I stood next to it.  Yeah.  And Batman and Robin would have pointed and went, yeah, cool.  And, like, thought I was cool for bringing it.  Why would you have been cool?  Because then it would be, their music would be playing.  I'd be standing there like, look, I brought your music. 
[01:28:30]  But then there's no place to plug it into the parking lot of the Walt Whitman Mall back then.  No, and you would have wound up scratching the record and all the kids would have stepped on it.  Oh, there was no room for that.  What a douchebag.  But I thought that was going to happen.  They wouldn't have heard it?  A couple things.  No, they wouldn't have heard it either.  A couple things.  You do remember crying at five years old?  Yeah.  I guess I do remember crying at five years old when my mom dropped me off at Jimmy Harwitz's house for a play date.  And by the time she left, I was already bawling like a little sissy.  And by the time she got home, the phone rang and she had to come and get me. 
[01:29:00]  How old were you?  And he only lived two miles away, by the way.  About the same age, I believe.  But the second thing, and more importantly, your dad would get mad that a five-year-old is crying?  Maybe I was six or something or seven.  No, I remember it was like Teaneck Drive.  We lived there, and I think I was like six to seven there, maybe.  It seems like you were still young enough where your dad should allow that.  Oh, no, no, no.  There'd be no crying.  Even as a little kid?  Stop crying.  I'll give you something to cry about.  Well, that usually stopped the tears, didn't it, now? 
[01:29:30]  Oh, yeah.  Just try to hold it back under fear of being smacked if you keep crying.  So you could just like...  The lip is going...  What does that teach you, kid?  Batman.  What does that teach you, kid?  Batman.  I don't know.  Then we were moving once, and I had this image of a...  See, I'd made this papier-mâché ostrich in school.  I'm starting to believe your father, by the way. 
[01:30:00]  Jimmy, you?  There's too many signs.  His father hit the fucking...  Hit the nail on the asshole.  He had every right to do what he did to you.  Holy shit.  There's too many signs.  A what?  A papier-mâché what?  His father just wanted another son to play catch with.  See, in class, we all had to make some kind of animal out of something.  And all these dumb kids brought in, like, these big square boxes and made, like, oh, here's a dog or here's a pig or here's something else. 
[01:30:30]  And their bodies were square.  And I'm like, I can't have that.  So the teacher was like, you know, here, you take some newspaper, roll it up, make the ostrich body out of just rolled up newspaper, and then take masking tape and make it all round.  Very creative.  And then I took some wrapping paper, cardboard tube for the neck.  Very creative.  And even the head.  I was able to cut it and, like, curl it a little so it had a beak. 
[01:31:00]  Yep.  And then legs.  And I used egg, two little slots for an egg carton for his feet.  And then his whole thing had to be dipped in plaster of Paris so he stood up because he wouldn't stand up very well.  But then the whole thing was covered in papier-mâché.  And then I painted it like an ostrich.  Nice.  And we had to move again.  See, look, I'm crying and Dad's telling me I'm an asshole.  But Jesus Christ, if maybe he held on to a house for more than fucking one year at a clip, we were constantly moving. 
[01:31:30]  It's terrible.  Oh, hi, new friends.  Oh, bye, new friends.  This is great.  So I had this impression that, like, the movers were going to take my ostrich, right, and put it in the moving van and tie, like, ropes around his neck and fasten it to the fasteners.  Like, to hold him up like you would a real ostrich.  What happened to the ostrich? 
[01:32:00]  Well, that really isn't very economical space-wise.  So it just got tossed in on top of some furniture and his neck broke.  So you cried?  Yeah.  And what did Daddy do?  He said something of, like, faggot or something.  Nice.  And said, ah, whatever.  Yeah, look, look, it's fine.  And the thing was just like, ah, ah, broken neck.  He had no clue that he had a real creative son, huh?  Did he ever have a clue of that?  He was very busy.  I think later in life, yeah. 
[01:32:30]  Because I was, you know, hilariously funny when I wasn't crying.  Did he start to appreciate you later in his life?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That I saw.  At least you got that going for you.  Because I stopped crying.  I just shoved it all down.  I swallowed it and ate everything.  And he was able to see you make something of yourself and become a radio star, which is good.  Oh, that's right.  No, he died about six months before that.  Oh.  That was great.  Oh.  Yeah, thanks for bringing that up.  That was a good one.  Oh, awkward.  After all the bullshit. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, boy.  All the crap.  I could have been like, hey, look, I'm in radio and doing really well.  Oh.  And, no, that wasn't.  Oh, he knows.  That wasn't to be.  You know, but I always felt he was looking down.  Nope.  Because I go through that shit in my life.  Like, I'm so bummed my dad didn't get to see us come back to radio and this and that.  And I'm so bummed that my dad wasn't allowed to see me get married and have a kid and a son.  And I have people in my family. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, he knows.  He knows.  Shut the fuck.  How do you know?  They're dead.  Pardon me?  I don't know anything.  Do you think pardon me likes to think that that's a possibility?  Sure.  But to hear it vocalize?  Oh, these people, like, they just know.  Oh, he knows.  He knows.  Really?  They're looking down.  Was he looking down then?  Was my dad looking down while I was fucking grabbing a chick's hair and mouth fucking her?  That's why.  It's like, you know something?  That's bad.  That's why I don't want him to know.  Did he know the horrible things I was thinking while I was jacking in the shower? 
[01:34:00]  Right.  Did the dead know that?  Yes, they do.  Did the dead know this?  Do you mean does the picture?  Oh, by the way, here's what I was jerking to.  That United Healthcare commercial with the surfing girl.  Holy shit.  What an ass on this girl.  Jesus fucking.  She's of age.  She can surf.  If she can surf, she can fuck.  She can surf.  She can fuck.  Yeah.  Charlie, don't fuck.  Get out there.  You either fuck or surf, Lance. 
[01:34:30]  I hate that.  Oh, he knows.  Like, this person has no doubt.  Because their faith is strong.  Well, maybe my faith isn't as strong as yours, so I'm still not sure.  It's a guardian angel.  He's looking down on you and making sure.  And he's so proud.  Is he?  Is he proud of me when I had a fucking fleshlight that I was just, I'm fucking a fucking flashlight?  Both our fathers are dead right now, right? 
[01:35:00]  You're kidding.  Right.  How did it happen?  Oh, God, love him.  Sam, will you turn down the lights, please?  Oh, we're going to have a tender moment?  No, no tender moments.  I'm just thinking, if my dad knows that I'm doing well on radio and I got married and I now have a son.  Yeah, yeah.  And aunt's father knows that he ended up doing very well for himself.  Yeah, I finally stopped crying at the drop of a hat. 
[01:35:30]  How about one of our fathers turns the lights back on?  That seems like a very simple thing.  Kind of easy thing to do.  Kind of easy in the afterlife.  It's like a seance.  Not a seance.  Having an impromptu seance.  I just want the fucking lights to flicker, go down further, or go up.  All right.  Because all those people out there in my life, he knows.  Wouldn't my dad love to tell me he knows right now?  Do they have an app that they could use to turn the lights up?  Are you looking at the lights, Ant? 
[01:36:00]  Anything?  I'm looking at the lights.  I'm looking at Sam, though, too, because he's a smartass.  Anything?  He'll start flicking him.  Anything?  Okay.  Oh, that was you, Sam.  That was Sam.  You're right, you're right.  That was Sam.  That's really just...  Oh, I thought for a moment.  That was me.  That was you.  For a moment.  I think we could all agree that our dads are...  Did you just see that?  Wait a minute.  I was over here.  Wait a minute.  Did you just see that?  I have my head down.  Get the fuck out of here!  Yeah, I swear to God I saw it. 
[01:36:30]  What just happened?  The lights blinked?  They flickered, dude.  Who's fucking with us?  I swear to God I was over here.  Ant, I'm not even fucking playing.  They flickered.  You were looking down.  I put my head down and the brim of my hat blocked the light.  All right, who's fucking with us?  I'm looking at a pair of tits on my phone.  I saw them flickering.  Sam.  I swear to God I'm over here.  You're not in on a dumb bit, right?  That's the only light switch I know about.  I was going to say they're dead as doorknobs and all of a sudden the fucking lights flickered.  Who's fucking with us from another room?  I don't know.  Dude, you saw that, right?  I swear to God I saw it.  Ant, I'm not. 
[01:37:00]  I'm stepping out of fucking character and all that bullshit.  I believe you.  I was ready to go for some hacky, stupid, our dads are dead as doorknobs.  And those, these fucking lights just flickered.  Yes.  Who has control of the lights somewhere else?  I'll go ask Mars.  I don't think anyone does.  You didn't see it though.  You were looking down.  Yeah, but I, I, I, I believe you.  No, that's creepy.  What happened?  Dude, I'm really creeped out.  I swear to God on cue. 
[01:37:30]  Wow.  Is there any way, someone has to tell us if they can control the lights somewhere else  and they can just fuck with us.  I don't think they can.  Aren't they on a dimmer switch?  So it could have just, you know.  Might have just been that he turned the dimmer down, turned it up and down again, and then  it just kind of found it.  Well, he went back to his seat.  Yeah, but then the dimmer itself just kind of found it.  All right, then reenact it right now.  It's a little thing.  I'll reenact it.  Okay.  Give it up, down, and then walk away.  And then put it back to where it is right now, Jimmy.  Which one is up?  Up, down.  Down.  There.  Now leave it.  Now leave it.  There. 
[01:38:00]  All right, now sit back down.  If they flicker, then.  No, it didn't, but it might have just that one time.  No, no, it took a second or two.  Might have sprung back a little bit.  Wow, I'm really freaked out.  I'm not even fucking fronting.  What the fuck was that?  I don't think that dead people communicate in radio studios by flicking the lights.  By flicking the lights.  All right, then explain what happened.  It was just a little thing on the dimmer switch.  A glitch.  Just a perfect timing thing.  Yeah.  I mean, obviously, it's an odd timing. 
[01:38:30]  Okay, if you can, if you're powerful enough to flick the lights, can you please get us all  raises?  Ooh.  What would you do if all the lights just exploded?  Now that would be fucked up.  I would fucking run.  That would be fucked up.  I don't think so.  Sam's coming back.  I want Sam on record.  Hey, E-Rock, did you see the lights flicker from where you were? 
[01:39:00]  I thought I did, but I also thought it was the reflection in the glass here.  He was eating at the time his eyes had rolled back white.  He was having Kittner Parmesan.  Hey, do you have any floss?  I got some surfboard stuck in my teeth.  Sam.  Kittner Parmesan.  Did those lights flicker?  I swear to God I saw them flicker the same time you did.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:39:30]  They flickered.  I didn't see it, but I believe it.  It stopped me in my tracks because I was, like I said, going for a hack line.  I looked down to read the pal talk, and I came back up.  It was a good flicker, too.  It went up, and then it went back down.  Wow.  And no one controls the lights somewhere else to just fuck with us?  No.  No, that's the only one.  That was weird, man.  I'm not saying anything after that.  Well, you gave the word.  I really do have magical powers.  Well, not you.  Yeah, you didn't do that.  You were just able to summon the dead. 
[01:40:00]  Well, that's pretty fucking magical.  You try to summon the dead.  Go ahead.  I did it.  Now it's your turn.  All right.  Mars, fix something.  Well, you should have went with Kenny.  He's more dead than Mars.  I'm teasing Mars.  He knows it.  And someone has figured out how old you were at Walt Whitman Mall.  Really?  I want to see if he's got...  Nah, that ain't even close.  George in Jersey.  Oh, yeah.  My name is Professor George.  I'm a mathematician. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  And I did some calculations here from when Batman's show was on and at his age today.  And his father's really unreasonable.  I mean, he was quite a young lad.  I figured out that he was exactly 13 years old.  No, that is not true.  No, no, no.  I also figured out when you stopped crying.  You were at the right young age of 19.  No, no.  See?  You're wrong.  Yeah, now you're playing silly games.  Yeah.  You're being silly.  No, no, no, no, no.  I'm qualified.  I went to school for this. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, shut up.  This is the worst bit ever.  Absolutely.  Hey, one more thing.  One more thing.  Here he goes.  He's going to try to redeem himself.  No, no, no, no, no.  My favorite commercial girl right now is the new Education Connection.  Everything here with the dark hair.  Education Connection.  This is one for Anthony.  Oh, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's got the dark hair and her little belly showing between her pants and her shirt.  She's got a little belly button showing.  Is she the one taking the classes at home or something? 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's it.  But it's the newest one.  Oh, yeah.  I like her.  Hot as fuck.  How old is she?  13.  Jesus.  No.  What's wrong with you guys?  Wait a minute.  This can't be it.  No, this isn't.  I've seen the same one you have.  Yeah, I know what you're talking about.  Yeah, she was the same thing to do when you were crying.  Would you stop?  Sam, what do you think the flickering lights were all about?  You were the only other one that saw it.  It was very weird.  Because Jimmy couldn't be bothered with us summoning your dad. 
[01:42:00]  He had to check his phone.  It wasn't reminiscent.  And he couldn't be bothered either.  He had to look down at all the shit.  For a second.  I can tell you where my son died back in February.  The night after he died.  I swear to God, this is true.  The night after he died, my wife and I were in the living room trying to forget it.  And sitting there watching television.  And I have a hutch up in the corner of my room.  And there's a piece of wood between the two doors there.  So they don't touch at all.  And this hutch leans forward a little bit.  So if they're not last, the doors will just fall open. 
[01:42:30]  We're sitting there watching television.  I heard the latches go.  And both doors blow open at the same time.  How old was he?  He was 19.  Nice.  Yep.  Dale Davis.  Dale, I love you.  What happened to him?  He's not listening.  Overdose.  Oish.  Yeah.  Talked around.  Fucked up.  Just like I did when I was a kid.  Well, not just like it.  They're talking on the phone.  Yeah, no, not just like it.  It came up to me, guys.  But I love him.  All right, George.  Thanks.  I'm not fine.  I love him.  Thanks, brother.  Thanks, guys.  Goodbye, George.  Goodbye.  Goodbye. 
[01:43:00]  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Twilight Zone where the phone wire hits the tombstone.  And the old woman's like, hello?  Hello?  Who's there?  Who's there?  Hello?  Hello?  And, yeah, it turned out to be fucking dead guy.  Tombstone fucking phone line.  I don't know why C-3PO was saying hello.  Travis, what's up with the lights?  I don't know.  I swear to God that was real.  Let me say hi to Corey in North Dakota, I guess.  Corey. 
[01:43:30]  Corey.  Hey, guys.  Hello, buddy.  I'm sitting here driving.  I got up at 4.30 this morning, and I'm just heading out to a job site.  I'm working construction.  And when you guys did that, when Opie said, oh, my God, did you see that?  I freaking got goosebumps really bad.  And that's all I wanted to say.  I'm bummed Ant didn't see it.  He was looking down.  I know.  And Sam absolutely saw it, too.  I'm not doing a dumb radio bit.  Because I came over after I had flicked the lights myself and brought them back down.  Right.  And I was all the way over at the desk, not anywhere near the switch. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  And I was looking up towards Opie, and I saw the lights flick.  I got to think it was a fader glitch.  Well, you know, in my construction job, I'm following my old man's footsteps.  And it just kind of, oh, I don't know.  I got letters in my heart.  Anyway.  Thank you.  Logically, I don't think it was my dad.  Of course not.  But that's how this shit happens.  If it was my dad, it was him showing that he, again, didn't pay the electric bill. 
[01:44:30]  But the timing on that was extremely strange.  Yeah.  I just want to stare at the lights.  Impeccable timing.  If it happens again.  Again.  If they can do it again.  No, I mean, if it just happens without us talking about this, then you'd know it was  some dumb glitch.  Unless they do it again to be like, oh, they're not believing.  Look, we gave them that one thing, and now they still don't believe it.  Or like, I listen to the whole show, just so you know.  Yeah.  If they do it again, I gotta go home.  They may just do it randomly in like an hour.  Yeah, yeah.  Just say, I listen all day, every day.  Yeah, yeah.  If they do it again, I go home.  Yeah. 
[01:45:00]  Long time dead.  First time caller.  Yeah, first time light flicker.  I got magical powers, Ant doesn't.  Because he tried to summon the dead, and let's remember what happened.  Nothing.  Nothing happened.  What if it was Ant's dead, and he waited until Ant was looking down just to be like, fuck  you.  I'm here.  You can't see me.  Well, that is true.  Don't bring up the crying stories again.  Don't bring up the crying stories.  Make me look like an asshole.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  So maybe it was Ant. 
[01:45:30]  Now we got a buzzkill saying there was a power surge in New York just at that moment that  I saw that.  I dare you.  Fuck out of here.  It wasn't a power surge, because the lights came up, and they didn't go off.  Yeah.  So stop it.  It's Jim Norton's birthday today.  Yes, it is.  Before we take a break.  Where's my gifts?  Oh.  Oh.  Did the company get me gifts?  Well, you got one gift already this morning.  You're not being sued by Sandy Kane.  Happy birthday.  That is a good gift.  That's a great gift.  And Opie's gift.  And my gift yesterday. 
[01:46:00]  That is a good gift.  And Ant's trying to make it sound like it was his gift, too.  But I came up with it myself.  You got gifts?  I gave a gift to Opie.  Oh, really?  Do I know what this is?  Does it rhyme with resignation?  It's not nice at all.  Did you say Fezination, though?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  I meant the same name.  Someone's going to be crying now.  Because he's going to be convinced that you did that on purpose.  Did you do it on purpose?  You did.  I was just rhyming.  But you did it on purpose, because that's what Fez is going to think. 
[01:46:30]  It's going to be a whole thing.  He won't think that.  He absolutely will.  Do you know Fez?  Huh?  Do you know Fez?  No.  Who is he?  He will think that.  He will not think that.  That's why I have to bring it up.  Oh, great.  Well, now Travis is attacking Fez.  No, I love Fez.  Why are you attacking Fez?  You picked the wrong rhyme, is what I'm saying.  Did I really?  Because now it's going to be a whole fucking thing.  Oh, no.  And Ronnie will ask him, and Fezzy will go, absolutely, I think he did it on purpose.  He doesn't believe I should be here anymore.  It's going to be a whole thing.  That's good.  I'm serious.  Enjoy that, because it only lasts six months, and then he comes down. 
[01:47:00]  Enjoy that one.  Let me tell you, it won't give me a half a second pause for thought.  But go on record now, because when you go on record and you say Fez, I swear I didn't  mean that.  He'll believe you.  I learned.  Why would I say that?  I learned from past experience.  That doesn't work.  I wouldn't say that to anybody if I improv the joke rhyme.  Did he say Fezination?  He did, right?  I said Fezignation.  Fezignation.  He rhymes with resignation.  Eric's probably got it ready to... 
[01:47:30]  Can I hear that again?  No, he's doing some other stuff.  Oh, why would he be paying attention?  What were you doing that was more important?  I'm trying to figure out which bet he was going to play.  Your whole job is to stare at us.  What were you doing, Iraq?  I was actually marking down the time of what you said.  Ah, there you go.  Mark the time.  Punk?  All right, now we can play, because you know where it is.  One second.  One second.  Klaatu Barata Necktie. 
[01:48:00]  Thank God we don't have PPMs.  Is something to do that again?  I'm trying.  This quarter hour would not do well in the PPMs.  Regular radio has to deal with PPMs.  Every 15 minutes has to be good.  It's fucking...  Regular radio.  I cannot think of a better place for suicide bombings than a regular radio station.  They are fucking terrible.  Yeah, they really are.  Fucking awful.  Terrible.  Six minutes of talking and then commercials. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, we see that sitting here.  This guy's going to explain the flickering, Ant, so we can go home and sleep peacefully.  John in Connecticut.  John.  What up, guys?  Hey.  First off, Jimmy, happy birthday.  Why, thank you.  You pudgy little fuck you.  Oh, you'll be fresh.  Oh, now, now.  Oh, come on.  I know.  Hey, uh, anyway.  I know.  You guys got all the lights off and everything like that.  What you're doing is, with all the lights off, ghosts that are around are attracted by EMF, 
[01:49:00]  which is electronic magnetic field.  And all the electricity that's going on inside the room there gives off the EMF field.  Believe me, there's no electricity in this room.  You've been listening.  There's absolutely no electricity.  Wait, do ghosts communicate sometimes, like, through weird methods?  Ghosts can communicate through EMF, which is an electromagnetic field.  That was an extremely moist fart.  There's your EMF. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, you may want to watch that.  There's your ghost.  Hope the ghosts pop out.  Start waving fucking air around.  Yeah, they pop out your ass like a little turtle ass.  Wait, so your theory is, if you turn down the lights, then it allows the ghost to what?  If there is a ghost in that building, then what it will do is...  The ghost of Raze's past.  Poor old ghost. 
[01:50:00]  Yes, wandering the building.  It's a good boy ghost or a nutty boy ghost.  What's that?  We heard you!  He got him.  Oh, man.  You're talking about EMF, huh?  Yeah.  Kevin writes EMF?  Oh, you're unbelievable!  Oh!  Of course, E-Rock has that, because he's that smart.  He heard EMF, and he's all over it. 
[01:50:30]  And go, E-Rock!  He rolled his eyes at you.  Oh, boy.  He doesn't have that either.  White again?  And EMFs.  I don't even want to start saying what that could mean.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Hey, Scott from my hometown of Centerport, Long Island, writes...  Oh, it's not, Scott.  It's my father.  This is your father, Greg.  Oh.  That wasn't me flickering the lights, you idiot.  I was busy getting a blowjob for Mary Antoinette.  Oh, wow.  Nice.  Did he write really? 
[01:51:00]  Mary Antoinette?  Yes, that's why I said it that way.  Mary.  Oh.  Mary Antoinette, her sister.  Well, maybe her sister was the goer, though.  She wasn't...  Well, she was the one who wasn't decapitated, so she could suck dick still.  Although, you never know.  Oh.  We have some...  Ha-ha!  Advertising.  Yeah.  Oh!  Oh!  Dan...  Dan...  Yeah.  Oh, it's getting very scary in here.  Oh!  This is some EMF going on.  And some Andrew Dice Clay, by the way.  Little known fact.  That was Dice. 
[01:51:30]  The dice clip.  Oh!  Every time you hear...  Oh!  That sounds very gay.  When do these guys die of AIDS?  I don't think they did that.  Look at these guys.  Too much.  Sorry.  I hear a dice.  Oh, you say!  With a sideways hat.  Very 90s.  You're unbelievable. 
[01:52:00]  Oh!  Oh!  What year is this?  Where's my head?  Fuck.  Let me guess.  This is a big...  I'm going to go 19...  84.  No, I'm going to say...  No way.  89 or 90.  No, I'm going 92.  I'm saying 92.  I'm saying 91.  Well...  I said...  Oh, I went one over.  Yeah!  No!  I said 91.  What, 91?  I said 91.  Number one in July 91.  Shit.  Holy shit.  That's a 90s song?  This is 20 years ago.  I mean...  And they came back in the 2000s. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, did they?  Yes.  How well did they do?  What?  I think they didn't do well at all.  Oh, they came back with a song called Kind of Believable?  Yeah.  Well, you might believe this.  Slightly believable!  Unbelievable!  We're still alive!  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  Eh.  Yeah, they were quite the...  Quite the crossover from the glam into grunge right there.  And they weren't really grunge, were they?  Let the record show. 
[01:53:00]  No.  I don't know what they were.  The lights have not flickered.  No, they haven't.  No, no.  Oh, flickered.  For Jimmy's birthday, we got this.  Cake?  Just play it, Travis?  Yeah, yeah.  We have audio gifts for you, Jimmy.  We got audio gifts.  Where's my cake?  I don't know.  But Delia, you bitch, where's my cake?  Creep show.  Great.  Oh, before we do this, I want to hear the rhyme thing that Jimmy did.  You're in a world of hurt, my friend.  You have no idea. 
[01:53:30]  Cool.  Hit it.  But I came up with gifts.  You got gifts?  I gave a gift to open.  Oh, really?  Do I know what this is?  Does it rhyme with Fez Ignation?  Oh, no.  Oh, you have no idea.  That's the first hour.  Fez Ignation.  Oh, man.  Unless he's got a big interview schedule.  That's the first hour right there, my friend.  Fez Ignation.  You had to say that.  Well, the way to look at it is that because I think of Fez often, he's at the forefront  of my mind.  So when I had to rhyme Rez, I mean, there's only so many words. 
[01:54:00]  Fez?  You could have said that, but I mean, obviously, because he's in the forefront of my mind more  than those other things are.  He's a guy I consider kind of a co-worker.  Says.  Kind of a co-worker.  What does that mean?  We're not on the same show together.  Oh, kind of.  He's not a co-worker because we don't do the show together.  That's true.  So he's kind of a co-worker because I feel like we're on the same team, but we just don't  do the radio together. 
[01:54:30]  Will Fez understand all these explanations?  He'll understand them in the sense that he's an intelligent being.  No.  I think his instincts will probably state that Jim deliberately said Fez Ignation because  he associates Fez with a desire to resign.  No, if I was going to say that, I wouldn't be subtle about it.  Believe me.  What would you say?  I would say something that indicated that I wanted him to leave.  Oh.  Don't say anything.  I don't have anything to say.  I don't want him to leave.  There's so much trouble already, you have no idea. 
[01:55:00]  That's okay.  I don't mind trouble.  It's like my favorite movie, I Love Trouble.  The Uncomfortable.  Oh, God.  I hate that movie, fucking.  Oh, I Love Trouble.  Yeah.  With the fucking videotape cover that I used to see at Blockbuster.  I Love Trouble.  Look out.  Oh, boy.  That would be a great video if there was him punching her on a pool table with his dick  out.  Or, no, caving her head in with the game Trouble.  With her fucking pants around her ankles.  She's unconscious.  She takes the Pop-O-Matic and shoves it in her vagina. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, and the sequel is Yahtzee Rules.  And she has a fucking Yahtzee tube in her asshole.  Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte.  And I Love Trouble.  I hate his fucking glasses in that one.  Oh, they're terrible.  I Love Trouble.  What's that?  I think it's just a...  Oh, that's some kind of nice.  Different language.  All art.  I don't know.  It's also...  I Love Trouble.  They're DJs.  They hate face, do they? 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  Everything's tinny.  It's a very tinny film.  You want another explanation for the power surge?  Yes.  You do?  I do.  All right.  Hold on.  Kevin in Pennsylvania.  Kevin.  Good morning, boys.  Hi.  Jimmy, happy birthday, by the way.  Very good.  A great picture of you and the great comedian.  I think it was probably just...  Honey's Rickles.  All right.  I think it was probably just Howard turning off his money counting machine and just give 
[01:56:30]  a power surge to the building.  Love you guys.  Well, if he turned it off, the lights would have went up.  Yeah, yeah.  It's all online anyway.  Turn it on.  Yeah, he doesn't use cash.  He gives private direct deposit.  What do you think, Howard has a fucking clock with a hole at the 12?  Yes, of course.  The fucking most blatantly obvious camera in a money counting room ever.  No one ever wanted to see what time it was and realize, why is there a perfectly round  hole where the 12 should be?  What a dolt. 
[01:57:00]  All digital clocks are better.  For Jimmy's birthday, we got audio gifts today.  Here's the first one, right?  No.  Happy birthday to all celebrating on this Friday, and we have a great list of great young people.  We do indeed, and we're wishing Sarah Elizabeth Randall a very happy fifth birthday.  Oh, what a cutie.  Great picture.  All of our love from mom and dad, big brother Cameron, big sister Sophie.  Now she can head and put on that new birthday dress. 
[01:57:30]  Yay!  Happy 12th birthday to Lennon Antoine.  Lots of love from Daddy, Kate, Grandma, Grandpa, Uncle Jesse, Aunt Amanda, and Cousins McKenzie  and Kacen.  Lennon, you're looking good, dude.  I like that.  You look sharp.  All right.  Happy 6th birthday to little Billy Tetley.  You're finally getting that hat you're always talking about.  Love your mommy, daddy, Sudley, Uncle Eric, and Aunt DeMeo.  Those are his godparents.  Daniel Thomas celebrating birthday number nines today, Dan.  Sudley. 
[01:58:00]  Aunt Mayo.  Aunt Mayo.  Aunt Mayo.  Eric got nailed on that one.  Little Billy Tetley.  He's a little Asian kid.  That was on the TV.  Yes, it was.  What local news did that?  That was in Ottawa, Canada.  Yeah, they did.  Breakfast, birthdays, little Billy Tetley.  Aw.  That's adorable.  Did you enjoy your audio gift?  I certainly did.  Oh, God.  That's funny. 
[01:58:30]  Billy.  You can't do this song, though, with Billy.  No.  B-I-L-L-Y-T-E-T-E-L-E-L-Y-Z.  B-I-L-L-Y-T-E-T-L-E-Y.  Bill Tetley.  That's hard to know.  You didn't say Billy.  Billy Tetley.  I did.  Oh, Billy Tetley at the end.  At the end.  Let me think about it.  Just give me a pen.  Give me a pen.  It's got to write down.  Hold on.  I have to get the...  Take the pen.  Oh, yeah.  It works out wonderfully. 
[01:59:00]  B-I-L-L-Y-T-E-T-E-L-E-Y.  Wait.  No, no.  Because I want to say T.  I have to get used.  B-I-L-L-Y-T-E-T-L-E-Y.  Bill Tetley.  Oh, there you're shoehorned.  That's why Billy Tetley does it.  It doesn't work.  Can you say double L?  Ooh.  B-I-L-L-Y-T-E-T-L-Y.  No, it's the last.  No, it's B-I-L-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y, Bill Tetley.  You need the T at the end of that.  I need the Y, Bill Tetley.  How does it end? 
[01:59:30]  It's a tough one.  It goes B-I-L-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y, Bill Tetley.  B-I-L-L-Y-T-E-T-E-T-E.  Oh, I think I got it.  B-I-L-L-Y-T-E.  No, too long.  B-I-L-L-Y-T-E-T-E-L-E-Y, Billy Tetley.  Got it.  B-I-L-L-Y-T-E-T-L-E-Y, Billy Tetley.  Billy Tetley.  That's how he started.  Little Billy Tetley. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  The Bill Tetley Variety Hour is shaping up nicely.  Oh, is it?  Yeah, with Cheap Trick Head signed on.  Oh, wow.  Are they recovering from the collapsing stage?  They are.  We're going to talk about that in the 40-minute stand-up interview.  Holy shit.  Bill Tetley is doing a 40-minute stand-up interview.  That's a Christmas special for Cheap Trick.  With Cheap Trick.  Yeah.  Now, why wouldn't they just talk a little and then Cheap Trick plays?  I just felt it would be, Bill felt it would be more interesting for them.  Oh, Bill felt. 
[02:00:30]  Bill has a warehouse rented and in one corner is going to be the Cheap Trick interview corner  where they're all just going to stand there and talk.  For how long?  40 minutes.  40 minutes.  Of the hour.  Yeah.  And then there's going to be a badminton off.  Really?  Yes.  This is breaking news.  Yes.  This is breaking news.  Yes.  How long is this special going to be?  It's an hour.  With commercials?  Yes.  Jimmy just goes, yes.  And his eyes go back and forth. 
[02:01:00]  You creep.  What's the badminton off?  Bill Tetley is going to play the badminton champion and probably lose to him badly.  And then go, ah, you're good.  Merry Christmas to whoever plays you.  And then how's the show end?  That's it.  Wait.  It's going to be what?  It's going to be Cheap Trick for 40 minutes talking.  Stand up.  Yeah, stand up interview.  And then it's going to be the Bill Tetley badminton off.  And he'll probably lose to the badminton champion.  And then he'll go, oh, Merry Christmas to whoever plays you. 
[02:01:30]  And then he'll wink at the camera and that'll end it.  I like it.  Yeah.  Does it have a big musical number to start this?  Christmas special?  Yeah, Bill Tetley's got it.  Does he sing?  Yeah.  Well, he sings the theme song and he has his Santa hat on for this one.  Ah.  Yeah.  Wah.  And he just wah.  The fucking ball on the Santa hat.  He turns his head and it flips over to the other side.  It's on the right.  Wah.  And then it goes over to the left.  And then wah, Bill Tetley.  And he turns his head to the left.  That's good.  And it says, it says, Bill.  That's good. 
[02:02:00]  Bill on his Santa hat.  Tetley around the back.  There's a little Christmas tree in the middle of the, right in the middle of the warehouse.  And that's the set?  Yeah.  That's it?  Yeah.  And then the badminton table.  That's the surprise at the end.  There's no badminton table.  There is.  There is?  I think so.  Are you thinking ping pong?  Oh.  Yeah.  I don't think there's a table.  It's not?  Wah.  It's just a net.  It's just a net.  Oh, that's easier then.  Why?  Just cut down production costs. 
[02:02:30]  And shipping.  Yeah.  And overtime for the union guys?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bill likes to be out quickly.  Okay.  Look forward to that.  Yeah.  Can we take a break?  You bet.  We could do that.  Fezzik Nation, huh?  Oh, you had it.  You had it.  I had no idea.  I had some cereal.  That means.  It's just something that rhymed.  That means he's finally going to move on from my faux pas.  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah.  He will.  We can only focus on one faux pas at a time. 
[02:03:00]  What was your faux pas again?  I'm not saying it.  Oh, boy.  Because then it's going to be me again.  Oh.  I know how this works.  Oh.  It's all about Fezzik Nation today.  Oh, shit.  I can't believe he actually said that.  Jimmy, do you want to go on record officially and say you didn't mean anything by that?  It might help you.  I would never explain to any person that I didn't mean a comedic riff.  I can't do that.  To anybody.  Exactly.  And he hasn't asked me to.  And the second you have one, explain what's going on. 
[02:03:30]  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.s.  Ears.  Fuck you.  Just fuck you.  Good at you.  B-I-L-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y.  Bill Tenley.  Fuck you.

[02:05:30]  Time now for birthdays on the 7th.  Turning 7 years young, Nevaeh, I'm hoping that's right, Stern.  She is a little piece of heaven, likes Hannah Montana, and likes to help others.  Nevaeh, happy birthday to you.  And turning 77 years young, Paul Hargis enjoys playing patty cake with all of his grandchildren.  And hey, this is the best part.  He enjoys watching First News every day.  Thank you, Paul.  And a very happy birthday to you.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The virus. 
[02:06:00]  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  All right.  We got a Khloe update.  A Khloe update?  It must mean Kardashian.  Khloe Kardashian tweeted after Lamar Odom was in a fender bender.  Ah, well, somebody had a fender bender.  Somebody else.  Well, that's what he thought, because he was safe in a limo.  Yeah.  When, what, someone on a motorcycle?  Yeah, it was a pedestrian and a motorcycle.  Crashed into the limo. 
[02:06:30]  And I believe Lamar Odom spilled his soft drink.  That's terrible.  And he had to change his tracksuit before he went to the Berber.  To get his hair.  Tragic.  Berber shop.  To get his hair.  In what, the old neighborhood?  Back in the hood, yeah.  He was going back to his old hood.  So, not a scratch on Lamar, not a scratch on Lamar Odom's at all.  But, wow, mangled bodies outside that limo.  Yeah, pretty bad.  And Khloe Kardashian decided it was a perfect time to tweet the following, if you will, because 
[02:07:00]  this is your thing.  Yes, she tweeted, where is that?  Oh, boy, boy.  She's a tweeter.  She does tend to tweet.  I thought I tweet a lot.  Holy shit, where is this tweet?  She does tend to tweet quite a bit.  And maybe there's more tweets about Lamar Odom's.  Oh, stop judging.  Oh, boy.  She's really getting into it, huh?  I'll start judging.  This could be good.  That's, uh...  Oh, and Kim had to get involved.  Oh, boy. 
[02:07:30]  All right, let's go.  She goes, my hubby and I are always protected by angels.  Thank you for keeping us filled with strength and love.  Tomorrow is never promised.  Live for today.  Well, and tomorrow was certainly not promised for one of the people outside the limo, Ant.  No.  Here's your update.  A 15-year-old pedestrian hurt in a crash evolving an SUV carrying L.A. Lakers star Lamar Odom  in Queens has died of his injuries, according to a report.  Oh, boy. 
[02:08:00]  So the angels weren't watching after him.  Oh, boy.  No.  Too many angels had to surround Chloe's big fucking monster body.  No one tweeting angel shit, huh?  No.  Yeah, head injuries.  The Thursday evening accident left the team with serious head injuries, and he died the  next day at a hospital.  But, um, how is Chloe holding up?  She's hanging in there, Ant.  Because her husband, let me tell you, that was close.  She's hanging in there.  That was close.  I heard they couldn't get a tow truck, so she just dragged the fucking limo to the service 
[02:08:30]  station.  Herself.  Yeah.  Like a fucking...  Like a fucking rock star.  Like a beast of burden.  She got one of those big harnesses, and she said, fuck it, I'll get this thing to the  service station myself.  A yoke.  A yoke?  You put on a yoke.  Is that what it's called?  Yes, that's those big things that oxen would wear to pull a plow with.  A yoke.  Yokes?  I tell a lot of yokes.  Ah, no, you don't.  The yoke's on you, Chipper. 
[02:09:00]  It's your birthday today, huh, Chipper?  Yeah.  Happy birthday.  What were the other tweets from Khloe Kardashian?  Why was she getting into it, Sam Roberts?  Well, one, you're saying, how is Khloe Kardashian holding up?  Yes.  She tweeted out this, you know, getting in touch with people.  What do you think of my new lip color?  Oh.  She decided to go bright for the summer.  Oh, so she moved on from what she thought was a fender bender for her husband, even though  a 15-year-old died outside the limo.  Did she die outside the limo?  Yeah.  And she's already talking about her lip color. 
[02:09:30]  It's a brighter shade of pink.  What a shallow fuck.  No kidding.  What a shallow motherfucker.  Same color as that poor kid's blood.  Maybe that.  She was inspired.  What are some of the other Khloe Kardashian tweets after this horrific accident?  It turns out to be a horrific accident for everyone except for Lamar Odom.  Did she send out condolences or anything, or how sad it is?  My heart and soul goes out to everyone in pain from any suffering.  Pray for all of the angels surrounding us constantly. 
[02:10:00]  May our spirits stay strong.  Stop the angels.  It's not vague or anything.  A lot of angels surrounding her.  That's right.  Yeah.  What else?  Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.  Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling.  Peter, 489.  Maybe she could ask one of the angels who her real father is.  Yes.  We all know. 
[02:10:30]  We won't do the break again, but come on.  There's something going on there.  She don't look like the other sisters.  She looks a little different, and she's a lot bigger than the rest of the sisters that  are hot pieces of ages.  Thank you so much for your love and support.  This makes us stronger as a couple.  God has us in his hands.  Oh, that's good.  Oh, so God didn't have the little kid in his hands?  What she's basically saying is...  Now, literally.  Yeah.  Basically saying God thought we were more important than the 15-year-old outside the limo  when Lamar Odom spilled his soft drink on his tracksuit as he was going to the Berber 
[02:11:00]  ship to get his...  A Berber shot.  Get my her did.  Berber.  So there was no God for that kid, huh?  Just an hour ago, so this was after the news broke about him dying.  Yes.  She wrote, I love New York, but I'm happy to be going home today.  I miss our bed and our house.  Well, I'm sure that 15-year-old would have been happy to go home as well.  We would have probably loved it.  It's a good one.  Yeah.  Time to wake up my hubby.  This will take at least an hour, LOL.  Who else takes a long time to finally get out of bed? 
[02:11:30]  Well, 15-year-old will.  I'm sure there was a mom just completely distraught going, wake up, wake up.  There's one head that'll never be coming off a pillow.  Yeah.  His family's acting like Ricky Schroeder in The Champ.  Oh, God.  Exactly.  And she's like, oh, boy, Lamar's tough to wake up in the morning.  Well, that figures, but.  Yeah.  You know.  Well, he's probably tired.  Yeah.  Big guy.  Athlete.  Monday.  Yeah, an athlete. 
[02:12:00]  Monday.  That's how it works.  Canadian.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  Mm-hmm.  That's how it works.  Having to sleep with that.  Big fat Chloe.  Probably got apnea.  You think Chloe has apnea?  Oh, God.  She's a beast.  Fuck them.  Language.  Fuck them.  Fuck that whole show.  And the only reason I say this is because Bruce Jenner was an American hero, and they treat  him like shit.  They've destroyed that man.  Remember his Wheaties commercial? 
[02:12:30]  Mm-hmm.  How inspiring.  Oh, Bruce.  You want a gold medal?  Who gives a fuck?  They don't care.  They have a store.  A new perfume coming out.  You're white.  We don't like you.  Right.  That's pretty much it.  What, Sam?  I'm saying he has a gold medal, but they have a store.  All right.  Good point.  What's it called?  Another store?  Dash.  Yeah, yeah.  Like Kardashian.  Yeah.  Kardashian.  Let me say hi to him.  Like Kardashian, it should be.  That's what happens.  Kardashian.  Ooh.  Very good. 
[02:13:00]  That's a good one.  There's his Wheaties commercial.  Look at Bruce Jenner.  He gets the gold.  Three, eight and a quarter.  Bruce Jenner's won the Olympic decathlon and set a new world record.  I really worked hard getting ready for that day.  Look at this guy.  I put in a lot of years.  Did he play for the Bay City Rollers, too?  He has a complete breakfast with Wheaties.  It's good tasting.  78.  And good for you.  He knocked back some Percy.  Take it from Bruce Jenner.  Wheaties is the breakfast of champions.  I love the fact there's empty seats behind him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking.  Now go to the John Belushi goof on that commercial from SNL. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  Remember that one?  Oh, yeah.  I do remember that.  I do not.  Big fat Belushi with a belly.  As he tries to find that, Anthony, compliment coming in for you, sir.  Brian in North Carolina.  Go ahead, Brian.  I really don't think.  I've been listening to this show forever, and I don't think I've ever laughed as hard  as I did yesterday.  Oh, thank you.  Oh.  Sorry.  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, I'm sorry to me. 
[02:14:00]  Compliment hijacking.  I'd love to hijack a compliment.  You certainly do.  Go ahead, sir.  What were you going to say?  Happy birthday, by the way.  Thank you, man.  I don't think I've ever laughed as hard as when Anthony was doing that Fred Gwynn impersonation  yesterday.  Oh, thank you, sir.  Yeah, that was because I kind of edged him in that direction.  Of course you did, Jimmy.  Yes, Chloe.  Here's Fred Gwynn.  Thank you, sir.  Dude, that really was brilliantly funny.  Oh, thank you, sir.  I won't. 
[02:14:30]  I won't.  I won't.  John Belushi is on his way to a gold medal in the decathlon.  They're setting the bar at seven feet.  Here's his approach.  Got Marv Alba to do the gold.  And he's got it.  Belushi's won the gold.  Now he's going for the world's record.  He's making his move.  They're in the final turn.  He's kicking it in.  He's got it.  A spectacular time of the world's record.  Unbelievable.  What a day for John Belushi. 
[02:15:00]  I logged a lot of miles training for that day.  And I downed a lot of donuts.  Little chocolate donuts.  His hair combed to the side.  It tastes good.  And they've got the sugar I need to get me going in the morning.  That's why Little Chocolate Donuts have been on my training table since I was a kid.  Little Chocolate Donuts.  The Donuts of Champions.  Ah, this shit was funny, man.  He's smoking a cigarette. 
[02:15:30]  Can't do that these days.  The kids might, you know, see it.  Kids.  So, here's your update on the car crash.  Yes, yes.  The car bash-y.  Ah, shit.  We got someone that almost got killed because they look like Casey Anthony.  Where is she now?  A couple of people on Twitter saying she's going to Puerto Rico.  No, people are now saying no, Puerto Rico.  Maybe Ohio.  She's got some type of loosely related person that has some kind of business where they make 
[02:16:00]  some money and she's just laying real low.  I don't think you're trying hard enough.  I think you could really get her to the compound.  I really do.  I know the deal.  I think you could get this done.  This has to, we know that the publicity and the news trucks and the protest is outside  of my house a bit much.  So, we know how long, you know, this has to blow over a little bit. 
[02:16:30]  And then, you know, she could be seen in a few other places.  And then, over to my house, by the time, it's only white people that are pissed.  And white people don't stay pissed long.  Are you trying?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Believe me.  Got some hooks in the water?  There's hooks in the water.  Yeah, definitely.  Good.  Oh, yeah.  I think you'll make it happen.  Yeah, it's going to happen.  Well, this woman almost got killed for being a lookalike.  Now, Samay Blackwell says a crazed woman tried to kill her just because she thought  Blackwell looked like Casey Anthony. 
[02:17:00]  Lacey Lowry has her heroine tale of survival tonight.  What the fuck is that?  What kind of fucking music are they playing?  What the fuck is that?  What's that music?  That was the news?  Ugh.  They make it a fucking movie.  Is that her?  All right, you got it.  Hey, you know what?  She did look a little like her.  Where is she?  Uh, it was a video over here after the ad, of course.  Of course.  You'll probably get to see it.  But, uh, if you didn't know... 
[02:17:30]  How'd she try to kill her?  I don't know.  I'll have to hear the story.  Can I ask something?  Story?  Why is the internet doing the exact same mistakes that regular TV did and piling ads on?  I don't know.  They don't know how else to monetize them.  But there's got to be another way to do it.  Around the border of the fucking video or something.  They'll do that eventually.  But why would you make the same mistakes?  That's why everyone went to the internet.  They were sick of ads and all that crap and not getting...  Being able to see stuff on demand.  They may think that if you can get away with one ad... 
[02:18:00]  Like, TV has minutes of commercials.  But they never stop there.  Well, I'm just telling you.  That's the part of the thing is.  Right.  I don't think they will stop there either.  I think you're right.  And around the borders, that's what they're going to do next.  That's next.  They'll probably do both.  Say, fuck that.  We can't have an ad before the video.  And we'll also do some shit around the border.  And then we'll also, like, superimpose something in your fucking videos.  Oh, yeah, in the video.  Let me see the story here.  Should we play it from there with the visual element?  Yeah, I kind of want to see what she...  All right.  Start over there.  News 9's Michael Konoposik joins us with more on this bizarre attack. 
[02:18:30]  Michael.  Well, Kelly and Amanda, shortly after Casey Anthony was acquitted on the charge that she  murdered her two-year-old daughter, signs of hatred mounted against her.  But so far, many will say none have been as bizarre as what we are told happened right  here in Oklahoma.  Oh.  It was a typical night for somebody Blackwell at a show to a convenience store where she  works until one customer's visit began a road rage of drama.  Blackwell may never forget. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, my God.  Help me.  I just started praying because I knew something was bad.  Blackwell says a suspicious woman entered the store shortly after 10 p.m. one night last  week and left after buying gas.  But that was not the last time their paths would cross.  I got in my vehicle and began to back out and looked, and I could tell she was staring  directly at me.  I could almost see the white in her eyes.  Blackwell says the woman followed her and rammed her truck, causing it to flip two and  a half times.  Wow.  She says she never talked with her attacker, but believes she was targeted because people 
[02:19:30]  tell her she resembles Casey Anthony.  All right.  Pause it.  Uh-oh.  Oh, Jesus.  This stupid broad did something else to the black lady.  You think?  Yes.  She doesn't look like Casey Anthony.  Or the lady was just a nut.  She does look like her a little bit, but who the fuck does?  A tiny bit.  Not enough where someone's going to lose their mind like that.  She did something to the black woman that the black woman thought was wrong.  Or the fuck, yeah, she might have cut her off or something.  Right.  Maybe she cut her off.  This is a lot.  Reprimanded her for drinking out of a fountain in Oklahoma. 
[02:20:00]  And the fucking news reporting it like that's the reason.  It's amazing.  Yeah, it's not the reason.  Yeah, scumbags.  They're assuming it's the reason because someone.  Because she said it.  Yeah, because one person might have said, yeah, you kind of look like an ugly version of Casey  Anthony.  What else does he say sitting there?  She was targeted because people tell her she resembles Casey Anthony.  A police report does not state the attacker thought the victim was Casey Anthony.  Why are you reporting it?  But at least one police officer in Shoto tells News 9 that was what the woman believed. 
[02:20:30]  There are millions of people who watched every moment of that case.  Let me tell you something.  Look at this guy.  From the time it happened all the way through.  Professor Howard Kurt says the verdict and media attention have angered many people.  He says the case in Shoto is rare, but attacks against the real Casey Anthony might not be.  Once you've been convicted in the media, how do you ever go back?  Kurt says Casey Anthony may never be able to lead a normal life.  She is set to be released from jail this Sunday, and there are reports that say she could move 
[02:21:00]  as close as Texas after the release.  Oh, they've got to keep the local angle.  Local angle.  Could she be as close to Oklahoma as Texas?  They are just milking it.  TMZ is on this.  TMZ is saying the story is fake.  TMZ also says that Sammy Blackwell says that the story is bogus.  Oh, yeah?  How is it bogus?  What part of it?  Yeah, what part?  Obviously, her car was run off the road. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  About a black one?  You got any more on this there, Sam?  She was going to get her herded.  At the beauty pearler.  At the pearler.  She doesn't look anything like her.  Get the fuck out of here.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  You guys want to know what Mr. McMahon's up to?  Vince, I read about this.  Is this a work? 
[02:22:00]  What?  What I heard.  Well, I mean.  Sam?  A lot of people out there don't listen.  And, of course, the people to ask if things are a work are Sam because he always is honest.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, well, I don't know why anyway still.  Hey, do you think that's.  Where are we at with wrestling?  How many days have we gone without a wrestler dying, first of all?  Oh, I would have to look it up real quick.  Randy Savage was the next one, right?  Randy Savage.  The last one, I mean?  Yeah, Randy Savage was the last one that officially made the clock.  That's over a month ago at this point. 
[02:22:30]  So, we're getting, you know, we're moving into 100 days.  Yeah, I don't know.  Yeah, we're getting there.  We're definitely not on our longest patch yet.  No.  Let's see if I have the date here.  It was, okay, it was 520.  So, we're looking at about.  Two months.  60 days about.  Two months from tomorrow.  It's a pretty nice stretch of time.  60 days where we might make 100 at.  I don't count.  We've been trying this for how long now?  Two to three years?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Two to three years.  All we wanted was 100 days to go by without a dead wrestler. 
[02:23:00]  And we're up to 59, 60 days, somewhere around there.  Yeah, 60 days will be the longest period of time in over a year that we've gone.  We're so going to do it this time, Sam.  Jesus.  I feel it.  Macho man was like, yeah.  And we can finally rest this bit.  Who is abscessed infection in.  Who is that one?  Like, go back a little ways.  Yeah, you got a whole.  Right there.  You keep tracking this stuff.  Tony Adams.  Tony Adams.  Abscess infection in her abdomen?  Yeah. 
[02:23:30]  How do you get that?  I guess she didn't go to regular checkups.  Oh, boy.  She didn't get her yearly physical.  What was she?  She was a...  Was she a diva?  A valet.  I mean, this was before the era of the divas.  Ah, valet.  Like in the 80s.  Yeah, they'd just bring her.  Okay.  She would bring the wrestler out.  Well, basically, what's been going on recently is that CM Punk, see, his contract was ending.  Who?  CM Punk.  All right.  Huge wrestler right now.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:24:00]  But he had a world title match on his last night in the company.  So he said he's going to win the belt and leave.  So Vince McMahon said, John Cena, if you lose the belt, I'm going to fire you because you can't let him leave with the belt.  John Cena, if you lose the belt.  You understand what I'm saying?  I try to keep it basic to keep all the non-wrestling fans on board.  But where did Vince go?  We know what he's up to, so let's cancel the match.  He tried, but John Cena insisted on having the match and got the crowd behind him.  Wait, wait, wait.  You know how that...  Isn't Vince the boss? 
[02:24:30]  Vince is the boss, but when you got the crowd behind you, Vince McMahon said, fine, you can have the match, but if you lose, I'm going to say John Cena.  And then he said, you know, you're fired.  But he said it like you said it.  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  So then at the pay-per-view on Sunday, which, by the way, was maybe the best pay-per-view in five years.  It was a fantastic pay-per-view.  Bullshit.  I know.  Did the feed go down?  No.  It didn't.  No.  The best in five years, so you're talking 162 pay-per-views. 
[02:25:00]  That one used to be twice a year, maybe.  It was a really good pay-per-view.  Yeah.  What is it, one every three weeks now?  Oh, my God.  That was crazy.  They do about 12 to 14 a year.  Live on pay-per-view.  Yeah.  WWE.  There's money in the bank.  Oh, yeah.  But Vince McMahon tried and tried, but everything he put out there, it didn't work, and CM Punk won the belt.  Oh, fuck.  So we're without a champion, because his contract ended.  He's gone.  He's gone.  Yeah.  With the belt. 
[02:25:30]  He has the belt.  Did he take it with him?  Yeah, he went to the Cubs game last night and was twit-picking.  Now, can't Vince just get the belt back from him?  No.  CM Punk won it.  And then after he won the belt, he went in the audience and left the building.  So what's the big deal?  Yeah.  There's no champion.  So then just make someone else a champion.  So why don't Vince just make a match between two guys and go, just say this guy retired,  so now we've got to figure out who the next champion is.  That's what all the sports do.  No, no, no.  He didn't retire.  He's going to take the belt to another company.  So? 
[02:26:00]  What?  That's another company.  It doesn't matter.  But it takes away the honor of the belt.  That's what Vince is worried about.  Cramerica?  Not that company.  A wrestling company.  Oh.  What is I'm just doing?  He's going to get in trouble.  He's putting a Japanese hat on.  Oh, I'll show.  What the hell is he doing?  It's like a Chinese hat with the braid, the black braid that comes out.  Oh, Jesus.  Am I going to get screwed for this? 
[02:26:30]  That's a bad idea.  He's probably had it like us, and he just wants to get fired.  It's awesome.  Looks like a fez hat almost.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  Showed your obsession.  You just said fez.  I hope he didn't say a word when he had that on.  For his sake, please.  Oh, you think you might have said something?  Please, God.  No.  Me, I should be played joke.  Me, Chinese.  Oh, wait a minute.  I was just going to do that.  Me, play joke.  Me, make pee pee in your Coke.  It was a hop-sing hat. 
[02:27:00]  What's happened with the wrestling belt?  Yeah, so let's see what happened.  The honor of the belt.  He doesn't want the WWE championship belt to be taken to a competing company.  But it can't.  Why didn't he sue?  Get the lawyers.  Because CM Punk won the belt.  Cease and desist.  It's his belt.  Yeah, it's WWE's property.  No, it's CM Punk.  They can't take it to another fucking place.  And his name is owned by them.  Besides, I got a championship belt.  No, no, no.  So how important are they?  It's a replica.  It wasn't a replica.  It's heavy, man.  No, I know. 
[02:27:30]  The spinny thing.  I have one, too.  But it's not the real belt.  You didn't go on pay-per-view and win it.  So Vince, all he has to do is just make a new belt.  Well, he is.  And he put together an eight-man tournament on Raw last night.  Oh, and that tournament decides.  But he ruined the last match and said, we don't have time for the final match because I have  something to say.  So you guys just leave.  He said, you know, you would think after all these years, Vince would have a game plan.  Does he make this shit up like we do?  Just as they go along. 
[02:28:00]  He did the whole eight-man tournament and the entire night, everybody was involved.  And then right before the last match started, he went out and said, this is bigger than  the match.  So I'm going to talk and cancel this match.  We'll do it next week.  So right now, we're still without a champion.  Still?  Mm-hmm.  Because he wanted to bring out John Cena so he could fire him.  Shit.  Oh, I mean, what?  But then in the end, the dude's going to come back.  We all know that.  CM Punk?  Well, he doesn't have a contract right now.  Yeah, but why are you watching this if you know in the end he's just going to come back?  Well, he doesn't have a contract right now. 
[02:28:30]  He's going to come back.  So just like blow off wrestling for two or three weeks because it takes forever with  these dumb storylines.  And then start watching again in a month and all of a sudden the announcement will be that  he's coming back to fight for his title because technically he's not the champion anymore  because he quit the company or left the company.  If he doesn't defend it within 30 days, he'll lose the belt.  That's for sure.  Oh, and then Vince gets it back anyway.  And then John Cena will be the champion.  No, they wouldn't just give it to him.  But how could John Cena be the champion if Vince McMahon fires him? 
[02:29:00]  When did he fire John Cena?  Well, I hope you're glad you asked.  Can't the British Bulldog get it?  Of course not.  Why?  He's dead.  Oh, shit.  I'm sorry.  I thought the answer was going to be that he's old.  I really didn't.  He wasn't that old.  I thought the British Bulldog could have come back.  Of course not.  With, you know, maybe Brutus the Barber beefcake.  He's still alive.  Well, he could come back then.  Bruised beefcake could, but Bulldog, no.  Not as much.  Not so much? 
[02:29:30]  No.  Oh, boy.  No, the British Bulldog's dead.  He tweeted a picture of the belt in his refrigerator.  That's right.  Showing disrespect.  Why is that disrespectful?  Listen.  Wait, why is that disrespectful to have it in the refrigerator?  Because he's like, look, I'm just treating it like a toy.  Yeah, but they've done horrible things to the Stanley Cup and all these other fucking trophies.  Well, now CM Punk is doing that to the belt.  Sam, why do you watch this?  What do you mean?  The same reason why everybody watches it.  Look at this.  TMZ.  New WWE champ parties in Chicago.  Oh, shit. 
[02:30:00]  CM Punk.  Sorry if you guys don't know who's on the front page of TMZ.  TMZ is even going with this crap?  It's a big deal.  Everybody's talking about it.  He's got a million, something, two million views on YouTube.  Here's what I think's going to happen.  What?  Vince is going to send out the big boss man to go get that belt back.  He has an enforcer in.  Because he's like a cop.  Good call.  So he's going to send the big boss man out.  Yeah.  And big boss man is going to be like, the big boss man.  And he's going to wave his stick and hit him with the nightstick and then take the belt back. 
[02:30:30]  What do you think?  Well, you know damn well why that wouldn't work.  Why?  He's a cop.  He's not a cop.  He's deceased.  He's dead.  Oh, shit.  You knew that.  Isn't he like Broward County or something?  Cobb County, Georgia.  Cobb County, Georgia.  Oh, I was thinking Broward County, Florida.  Is that a real county?  Yeah, it's a real county.  Cobb County, Georgia.  Didn't his song mention Cobb County or something?  Yeah.  If you ever take a trip down to Cobb County, Georgia, you better read the signs, respect  the law and order. 
[02:31:00]  You'll serve hard time.  Hard time, right?  You'll be serving hard time.  That was his big thing.  You're going to be serving hard time.  Oh, boy.  See, I just thought he'd be the guy to send if there was a theft.  No, he's not the guy.  He's the guy.  If he goes to Canada, the Mountie is still alive.  The Mountie.  I could stop him.  It stops.  But, no, the big boss means deceased.  Oh, that's a shame.  But, yeah, so...  Hey, it's my birthday, right?  Yeah.  Jimmy Norton.  Am I allowed to make requests?  Yes, you are, Jimmy.  Immediately stop talking about wrestling. 
[02:31:30]  Well, it is Jimmy's birthday.  Anyway, we have to really immediately stop talking about wrestling.  I hope you don't make any other requests.  That's a great request.  It's a great request.  People are saying, thank you, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Thank you.  That's right.  You just gave a birthday present to everybody.  I would like some cake.  Yeah, what about the cake?  Is there cake?  I don't know.  Is there cake?  I don't know. 
[02:32:00]  How did no one think of getting cake for Jimmy's birthday?  I don't know.  That's disrespectful.  Maybe it's going to be a surprise.  Better be a surprise in the next 20 minutes.  Yeah, better really be a surprise quickly.  What, is it going to be a surprise in the elevator at 10.02?  Yeah.  Are we going to cut up the cake?  Please.  Like, have ups and downs or something, you know?  Oh.  Jimmy's starting to realize that maybe there's not much going on today, Sam.  Oh, Jimmy wanted a whole big thing.  No, Jimmy realized at 6.04 that today was going to be a birthday bust. 
[02:32:30]  Yesterday?  All right, what are we talking about instead of wrestling?  Anything more exciting to me.  How about juice?  Let's talk about fruit juice.  Fruit juice.  Ah, you know what?  Pulpless orange.  I like with pulp, actually.  Believe it or not.  That's crazy.  I do.  We're taking the calls right now.  Pulp or no pulp.  I like pulp.  I tried palma granite, and it wasn't as good as I thought it would be.  Palma granite?  Palma granite?  Did you just say palma granite?  Palma granite?  Ugh.  Palma granite.  Palma granite?  Yeah, I tried it. 
[02:33:00]  It wasn't that good.  Palma granite.  You know the only time you don't want pulp is when you're eating pussy.  You don't want a pulpy vaginal discharge.  Oh, God.  Happy birthday to me.  Oh, pulp.  Happy birthday to you.  Yeah, you don't want that.  No, I don't like pulp.  It's very good in orange juice, though.  I like to chew it and swallow it.  No.  I feel like you're eating the whole orange.  No, no, no.  I just eat an orange.  Because I'd rather drink one.  Oh.  Yeah, true. 
[02:33:30]  I usually have a drink.  Some fruits are much better to just drink.  Yeah, because then I have fucking acidity all over my fingers, and I go to rub my eyes.  Oh, ow.  Or it burns.  Or I touch my cockhole.  Why do you eat an orange when you can just drink that shit?  Right.  You can't drink a banana.  You get the rinds under your nails from scraping through the fucking orange.  What other fruits would you rather drink than eat?  Apple?  Yes.  Apple.  Apples are too much fucking work.  I like bananas in a banana split. 
[02:34:00]  Do you?  I do.  Can we get banana splits for everybody for Jimmy's birthday?  I haven't had a banana split in years.  I would love a banana split.  Indeed.  Yes.  Cherry or no cherry?  I don't like cherries.  I think they're the most overrated fruit.  Wow, they're good.  They're the most overrated fruit since Adam Lambert.  Couldn't think of another gay guy.  What about a good kiwi?  It's a little bitter for a fucking ice cream.  You get kiwi and shove it up, you cunt.  Kiwi's all right in between a bunch of orange slices. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, I like it with my fruit platter.  A little bit here.  I don't like citrus in my fruit plates.  Are you a brown guy?  I like melon.  Ah, grapies.  What about pineapple?  Pineapple occasionally sometimes.  Oh, that'll give me some reflux.  How about mango?  Grapefruit.  No, never grapefruit.  I've never had grapefruit.  I've had grapefruit once, and I thought it was like a big orange in the fridge.  And I ate a wedge of it, and I started crying because it was so bitter. 
[02:35:00]  Dad called me a faggot.  Wow.  And then mushed the grapefruit in my face like an old-timey movie.  Like fucking James Cagney.  Yes.  Ah, yo.  You know, we can't bring up fruit juices without playing a clip.  Which clip is that?  This clip.  You're on a health food kick.  I guess so, yeah.  Now, the blueberry is one that can't work on its own.  It has to have something with it, like the kiwi.  It's not a stand-alone fruit. 
[02:35:30]  The voice is going to get the spot.  Why isn't that viral on the internet?  That is the most uncomfortable moment in radio history.  Oh, my God.  Look, I'm not going to tell you what you should or shouldn't put up on your YouTube channel. 
[02:36:00]  It's, uh...  It's, uh...  But you could probably get a viral hit out of that.  We don't have a video, though, man.  Just show blueberries.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  You should show blueberries, and then other fruit, and then the other fruit kind of coming  up towards the blueberries, and then walking away.  Coke Logic can animate it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Coke Logic, we're going to be a team on this.  You animate, you'll get all the fame and glory, but it's got to go on my channel.  That's fair.  That's fair enough.  Get to it, Coke Logic.  Get to it.  Quick animation. 
[02:36:30]  How about this?  Get to it, bitch.  It doesn't have to be too involved.  And then send it in.  Email it to somebody, and I'll pop that up.  Fuck it.  You ever try grapefruit with sugar on it, though?  No.  What about pink grapefruit?  It's bitter.  It's good with sugar.  It's bitter.  Pink grapefruit.  Pink grapefruit is bitter.  It's just a bitter fucking fruit.  Does pink grapefruit work here?  Why not just have an orange?  Because you drink your orange.  Grapefruit is good for dieting, I think, because that just cuts through all the fat. 
[02:37:00]  Is it nauseous?  Yeah, maybe.  You can't eat.  Terrible.  You're bedridden.  I learned the acid breaks down the cholesterol.  Oh, is that what it is?  Yeah, that's why you do that.  Really?  Is that why you do that?  Where's everybody at with pears?  Pears are a fruit of the past.  They're great in balls or tits.  They're great in balls.  Someone's been hanging out at Second City.  Eyes, ears, nipples.  I think pears are a fruit of the past. 
[02:37:30]  Badden tumors.  You might be right about that.  They've kind of gone the way of the prune.  Pears suck.  They were big when I was younger, but ever since then, you haven't heard much about pears.  You ever have an apple pear?  No.  It's not going to make you kill.  No.  And some pears, you bite into them, and it's like, wow, that's great.  Other ones, it's horrible.  I don't like iffy fruit.  What about fruits that are iffy?  Jim Neighbors loved them.  He would always sing, oh, oh, my pear pear.  Not even on your birthday. 
[02:38:00]  Will you get away with that load of shite?  Oh, my pear pear.  I got one.  I think it's a newer fruit.  I've never heard of it growing up.  Oh.  Mango.  Oh, the mango.  That's old school.  I never ate mango.  That's the only way you're from.  Chef almost got killed for that.  Who?  Have a fucking mango in potless now.  Yeah, he was looking for a mango and a tiger almost got.  He threw the mangoes at Lance.  Have a mango. 
[02:38:30]  Make a fucking mango pie or something.  What if instead of an orange, a tangerine?  Do you differentiate?  Tangerines are good.  Not really.  It's a little sweeter.  What about the clementine?  Little orange.  I love a clementine.  Clementine could be the best fucking fruit ever.  I don't know what that is.  Clementine.  It's like a small, sweet orange with no seeds.  And if they're in season, the best thing going, you'll eat eight of them in one sitting.  Oh, yeah.  You buy a box of them.  They look like oranges, though?  Oh, yeah.  Clementine.  I've probably eaten.  You know, this is the funny story. 
[02:39:00]  I've probably eaten them thinking they were oranges, not realizing that I was actually  eating clementines.  Oh, see.  That's a funny story.  Humorous anecdote.  Yeah.  Because if you'd have said to me, at gunpoint, what do we eat?  I would have said oranges.  And you'd have said clementines.  I'd be like, no.  They come in those cartons.  Yes, I've eaten, I've, I've fucking, I should be called the clementine kid.  What about the papaya?  I think they are.  Oh.  I hate seeds.  What do you think?  Orange seeds in like, when, when people squeeze things, like freshly squoze an orange juice, 
[02:39:30]  if there's a seed that gets sucked up in the straw or something, it grosses me out so  bad.  Really?  I hate seeds.  I'm raising my hand.  You're what?  You're in?  I'm officially in a 15 minute bad mood.  Why?  Shit.  15 minutes.  Wow, you like seeds?  No, I didn't like fucking seeds.  But my mom would never buy the, what's the one orange?  The one?  Clementines.  No, with the navels.  The navel orange.  What the hell is it called?  Yeah, sun-kissed.  She would buy the shitty ones that you didn't even know was an orange with the peels that 
[02:40:00]  were paper thin and was filled with fucking seeds because they were cheaper and wall-bounds.  And when you would chew the orange, it would be like all dry.  There's nothing worse than a fucking dry orange.  How is an orange dry?  You ever eat a fucking?  Menopause, yeah.  A fucking mealy orange?  A post-menopausal orange.  What are the oranges with the big, huge, thick skin, man?  Tough oranges.  What are they called?  Navel oranges.  They're just called navel oranges?  They're the ones that have that conjoined twin orange at the bottom sometimes by the navel.  Yeah.  It's like, what the fuck is that? 
[02:40:30]  You gotta pull it apart.  Remember how, like, the color orange, you understood what you were eating.  Not at our house.  Big, thick peel.  You could actually take it off in one piece.  Our oranges were yellowish-green on the outside and a lot of seeds on the inside.  You were fucking...  I hate a fucking mealy orange.  Dry, stringy.  You know those type of oranges?  Yes.  You're all ready for some delicious orange and you get that mealy hunk of shit.  There's nothing in there juicy.  Yeah, you want to find out who picked it and just smashed it a ladder.  And you were poor too. 
[02:41:00]  You didn't have the cheap oranges?  Oh, it's poor.  No, my mom actually...  You had the cheap oranges and the pepper-rich farm bread.  She juggled the books.  She juggled the books enough and had enough jobs where she made some cash money under the table where she was able to support us.  We always ate the best stuff.  Ronzoni.  Sonoboni.  What do you guys think?  We had all kinds of good name brand shit.  Never know frills.  Fuck.  Oreo cookies, not Hydrox.  What do you guys think of this idea that technically tomato is a fruit? 
[02:41:30]  I don't like that at all.  No.  And why don't you save that piece of shit for the 10 o'clock hour?  Exactly.  We're talking about fruit.  Motherfucker.  No.  Sorry.  As you said that, a tomato should have been fucking cannon-fired in your head, and instead  of a tomato, it's a red rock.  Oh.  To your fucking temple.  And when you go to the supermarket, where are the tomatoes located?  Vegetables.  Thank you.  It's a vegetable.  I don't care what scientifically they say, but...  No one looks at it like a fucking fruit.  Do you prefer corn on the cob or off the cob? 
[02:42:00]  I like it on the cob.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  It's on the cob, unless there are...  Sometimes I will get a hankering for, believe it or not, creamed corn.  Ew.  Ew.  What the fuck?  That's a corn with a yeast infection.  I'd rather have a grapefruit.  Fucking creamed corn blows.  Creamed corn?  You just lost everybody.  Nah, sometimes...  And I said sometimes.  Yeah?  Not all the time.  You like the sweet corn where it's like...  No! 
[02:42:30]  The one that's whitish?  Fuck that.  Give me a cob of corn.  What?  The fucking pipe made a corn cob.  And a fucking...  And a pig to fuck with those two little corn stick things.  Oh, yes.  I like those.  Do you have those little fat hips?  I'm the only one that's into sweet corn?  Yeah.  Where it's whitish?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  That shit is amazing.  That's terrible.  That's terrible.  You just like your stereotypical really yellow corn.  Corn on the cob.  Corn on the cob.  Cowardly corn.  Oh, this is on the cob, too.  You ever notice people that eat corn on the cob?  It's very...  It's a pattern. 
[02:43:00]  It's a distinct pattern.  Some people leave a spiral.  Some people leave a triangle where you look at the cob after you're done and it's a distinct  shape every time depending on how you eat the corn.  I swear.  It's like a fingerprint.  My teeth feel like fucking wedges have been driven in between them after I eat corn on  the cob because I always get a fucking piece of corn between each tooth.  That's terrible.  It's like little wedges.  It's like a floss.  My teeth itch.  Imagine having a food pocket like myself.  That shit gets packed in there.  Oh, boy.  That's got to get in there.  I don't find it for months sometimes. 
[02:43:30]  That's got to get in there.  And then my coffee lid smells around.  Oh, God.  Rotted corn.  When you eat corn on the cob, do you eat the whole cob in one sort of...  Or do you put it back down on the plate and then take another bite?  Because I find...  What are you, a fucking wood chipper?  You put it down.  I find that I'm just...  No, when I start my corn, I got to go the distance.  Yeah, me too.  You have to.  Although I will put it down to wipe my mouth off because I will not be seen with any food  around my mouth.  That is like a phobia of mine. 
[02:44:00]  I don't like being seen with food stuck on my cheek or the side of my lip or something.  I'm constantly wiping my mouth with a napkin.  It's unfortunate you're not also afraid of screaming racial epithets at three in the morning  in your hot tub.  No.  No fear of that.  Not in my neighborhood.  I hear applause from the neighbors.  You've heard that a few times, Jimmy?  Oh, yeah.  It's just endless.  It's just uncomfortable.  Oh, it's got to be.  You're not even here, Andrew.  No.  You're by yourself.  It's okay.  It doesn't matter.  I like this.  Go ahead, Sam.  Next one. 
[02:44:30]  What about...  We haven't mentioned nectarines once.  Nectarines?  Now, a nectarine falls into that whole orange, tangerine, clementine thing.  But why are there so many different varieties?  Because it's not...  Of citrus?  Yeah.  It's not like it's a type of orange.  And nectarine is a separate fruit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And tangerine, nectarine, and clementine you'd think would be types of oranges, but they're  not.  That one's kumquat, a clementine is cold.  That one's going nowhere, so I'm going to go with this one.  Okay.  Steve told me.  Very controversial fruit.  Controversial fruit.  The watermelon. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, I thought you meant Harvey Milk.  Yes.  I have one of a kufu.  I'm not a fan of watermelon.  What?  I like it in a fruit plate.  It's delicious.  Nope.  Does not like watermelon.  I don't like eating water.  That's crazy.  That's insane.  There's no substance to it.  No.  There's some sweetness to it.  It's delicious.  It's like eating according to Jim.  No substance.  Sorry.  Sorry we forced you to explain it, but in that case, it works.  That's really good. 
[02:45:30]  Watermelon's delicious.  Yes.  I don't like watermelon.  I like a little, but I can't eat a lot.  I'll eat it, but I'm...  All right, Mr. Melon, how do you feel about the cantaloupe?  Cantaloupe over melon.  I'd prefer someone who cantaloupe.  You know, maybe they're just not ready to get married.  Horrible.  Cantaloupe.  Why not?  Well, he's paralyzed below the neck.  Cantaloupe.  You can just lay there and bark out orders. 
[02:46:00]  What about honeydew?  Honeydew.  Oh, honeydew melon.  Cantaloupe and melon.  I'm not a fan of it.  It's got to be ripe, though.  Cantaloupe is good.  The second cantaloupe crunches, get it the fuck away from me.  You don't like that.  When it's not ripe.  What about when it's a little too ripe and then it has that rotting taste?  I don't like that either.  Yeah, my mom would get the bruised cantaloupes, too.  Oh, brother.  Really?  Yes.  She'd get cantaloupes who didn't listen?  Because they were beaten.  They don't do...  Bombing today.  When we were growing up, wall bombs. 
[02:46:30]  Wall bombs.  Do you like wall bombs?  I didn't know.  That's the supermarket on Long Island.  You had your wall bombs and King Cullen.  And there was a section in one of these supermarkets where they had bruised apples that were less expensive.  So guess who?  Dear old mom.  Loved to shop at the supermarket.  Just cut the bruise out.  Love the deal.  Exactly.  Have to bruisectomies on your fucking apples.  Oh, you're doing surgery on your apple. 
[02:47:00]  I'm surprised we haven't mentioned peaches yet.  Oh, I thought Travis was going to mention some bruised fucking apple.  Or bruised soul.  Bruised soul.  Bruised heart.  Until he walks by a synagogue.  Trying to eat a matzo.  Travis, you got one?  Got some bitter herbs.  Anything?  Yeah.  No, I kind of just wanted to tell you something.  What?  No, just Opie in his ear.  Oh, come on.  Oh, no.  A message just for me.  No, I would tell everyone.  I don't mean that.  It's a secret. 
[02:47:30]  I hate these fucking...  Did you hear it?  Another fessignation.  No, I wouldn't say fessignation.  I have to piss.  I don't know if I heard it yet.  Do you like, like, when you squeeze a peach, should it be firm or not that firm?  We have Jim's cake ready!  Well, you weren't supposed to say it on the air.  Oh, I wasn't supposed to say it on the air.  Oh, my big surprise!  Oh, this is the disappointment birthday surprise blown sound.  He's shaking his granola like a mad person.  Why is it a secret?  I don't know.  Wow, Jesus' face on that receipt. 
[02:48:00]  Oh, boy.  It really does look like Jesus' face on a Walmart receipt, the back of it.  See that?  They took it home.  That's how Christ would work as a greeter.  And it's Jesus' face on there, and I'm sure it will go for, like, thousands on eBay.  Do I have time to pee before my fucking...  Oh, I think we should take a break before the big kid presentation.  Oh, yeah.  Birthday cock comes in?  Can I ask you one question?  Yes, sir.  When it was birthday time at your house, how did it go down?  What do you mean?  And Jimmy, too.  Like when I was a kid?  Yeah.  Party.  Yeah.  With friends that came over, and, you know, the basic hats, and not noisemakers, but pin 
[02:48:30]  the tail on the donkey, and they'd give him a little presence.  But, like, when the birthday cake came out.  Oh, it was, like, oh, here it comes.  You'd be like, oh, and then they'd shut the lights out.  There was no trickery?  Yeah, yeah, there was some, you know, they'd have to keep you out of the room.  In my house, the trickery was that I had a phone call every birthday.  From who?  The president?  They would go, Greg.  You're a kid.  Greg, you got a phone call.  Would you believe it, or you knew?  Every year, I would fall for it. 
[02:49:00]  Really?  And then I'd walk down into the kitchen, because that's where the phone was hung up,  and, oh, boy, I didn't have a phone call, but I had a birthday cake.  Oh!  Year after year after year after year.  Get a phone call.  You fell for it every time?  Every kid in the house.  Were you on to it?  Wow.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Did the phone ring?  Yeah, they actually would call someone and go, hey, could you call the house real fast?  My parents did just the opposite.  They said, Jim, come on down for your birthday cake, and I'd get down there, and it would  be a fucking phone call. 
[02:49:30]  Sorry, I'm telling you there's no cake.  Fuck off.  Yeah, we don't have any cake, but you do have leukemia, because you come down to the hospital.  What a bad sixth birthday that was.  They would surprise me every year.  They would pretend they were gathering friends, but it really wasn't.  How did they trick you in?  It was usually get me out of the kitchen area, which was easy.  But how did they get you back in?  See, they got us back in by saying we had a phone call.  Um, I think it was just like, come on inside. 
[02:50:00]  We got to, you know, some other party bullshit going on.  You know, like a game.  Like, hey, we're playing musical chairs.  And then...  A lucky boy sits on the moon with a fist on it.  It was very old.  It's a very old school party.  Believe me.  Musical chairs?  It was a weird 18th birthday.  There was no Xbox.  Yeah, so it was my 18th.  Your shitty kitchen chairs?  There was no Xbox.  Believe me.  Yes, and there was always one chair too little for everybody.  I hated that game.  They should just make it so everyone could sit.  Would you cry when you didn't get the chair at the end? 
[02:50:30]  I would get upset.  I wouldn't cry, because I didn't cry at my birthday parties.  Yeah, I don't remember actually crying at a birthday party.  I hated the fucking wheelchair kid for musical chairs.  You have to tip him over.  Watch old fucking turnip legs lay there while everyone sat in his chair and rolled around and laughed.  And said how much fun it was.  Yeah, we...  I don't think I've ever had a handicapped person or a black person at any of my parties growing up. 
[02:51:00]  I just realized if I could tap dance, what I would stand up and say right now is,  this is how you end every argument with somebody in the wheelchair.  Hey, at least I can do this.  Do the Charleston.  Or do anything.  Just stand up.  Walk.  And this little piggy laid here.  This little piggy did the same.  This little piggy laid here as well.  This little piggy had nothing to eat.  This little piggy said nothing.  Yeah, and Central Island, I wasn't allowed to invite the little black kid that was occasionally a friend of mine. 
[02:51:30]  I wasn't allowed to invite him over to my house for a party because there was only one apartment building that was designated to all the blacks in the whole apartment complex.  It was right there on Hawthorne Avenue in Central Islip.  And it was a bunch of apartments.  And then one building, they put all the blacks in one building.  Swear to you.  And then all the white people were in the other buildings.  So, Warren, why weren't you allowed to have one of the kids over? 
[02:52:00]  Ah, my dad probably said, hey, you know.  No blanks in my house.  Yeah, yeah.  He probably did say that.  Or I just wasn't really that good of friends with him.  And then one time, the white kids put a dead bird in his catcher's mitt.  Ugh.  Yeah.  And he goes, somebody put meat in my glove.  Red meat.  Because the bird was ripped apart and shit.  Because, like, a cat had ripped it up.  And then the kids in the complex shoved the dead bird in the black kid's, like, baseball glove. 
[02:52:30]  Why?  Because they thought it was funny when he put his hand in there and grabbed a dead bird.  You know.  Hey, come on.  It was 1970.  You haven't made what you want.  Civil rights.  Wait, wait, wait.  Blow me.  Look what's coming down the hall, Jimmy.  Oh, shit.  Hopefully it's a toilet.  I gotta take a piss.  Well, no, we gotta do...  Oh.  Oh, my.  Now the curtains are being closed.  The curtains are being closed.  I don't have time to piss.  You want to pee first? 
[02:53:00]  Piss on the cake.  It gives a shit.  I see some light moving across the curtain.  He wants to go to the bathroom first.  Oh.  Oh, that's all right.  We'll bring the cake in.  I'm here.  Happy birthday to you.  Thank you, Roland.  Happy birthday to you.  Thank you.  Happy birthday, dear Jimmy.  Yay.  Happy birthday to you. 
[02:53:30]  What's that, like, 75 candles or something?  Oh, no.  Jimmy.  I hope they're trick candles that don't blow out.  I love that gag.  It'd be great if they were, like, trick IED candles.  Oh, Jesus.  Smoke detector's gonna go off.  No wish coming true.  No, but I didn't want to blow spittle over it, so I'd blow gently.  Oh, my God.  And gingerly. 
[02:54:00]  Wow.  A lot of smoke.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Second half birthday cake.  All right, what kind of birthday cake do we get?  Ice cream.  It better be ice cream.  Ice cream.  You scream.  We all scream.  For ice cream.  Yay.  Kill yourself.  Oh, shit.  Oh, look.  There are little stars on the candles because Jimmy's a star.  Oh.  No, that's what I had at Dwayne Reed.  Oh, okay.  Why is Roland sweating from just carrying the birthday cake in? 
[02:54:30]  I think I got to Dwayne Reed and it's hot out there.  And it's a fucking ice cream cake, so you must have, what did you run?  Roland, someone was spying on you yesterday on Twitter.  Oh.  Do you have any words for that guy?  Uh, I've been there.  Where were you yesterday?  And be honest, because I don't know.  Oh, jeez.  The gay bar.  You went to the gay bar yesterday?  No, I was with your mom.  It's just the gay bar.  Oh, Sam, see, he's applying that he might have sex with your mom.  Wow.  What Roland doesn't know is my mom hangs out at gay bars.  Oh. 
[02:55:00]  Dad spun around and around.  And that's why she does an awful blowjob.  Anyways.  Oh, wow.  That's so far.  You think at gay bars they would be good at giving blowjobs?  During work hours.  You should have said that's why she's so good.  Yeah.  Okay, you weren't blowing off work, but during work hours, we're working.  Too bad, our ass sucks.  Um, I had to go to, uh, Ben and Jerry's.  I bought the cake.  They came back, and then I went home.  To Ben and Jerry's cake?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  Wow.  The kind of ice cream.  He nailed it.  Someone tweeted a picture of Roland at Ben and Jerry's, and they were making fun of you. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, because, um, because, um, some people above us didn't think about buying  the cake, so I took it by myself to buy the cake.  Wait, those asshole fucking suit managing, you had to buy the cake, Roland?  I bought the cake, but Rob has a receipt to reimburse me.  But did Rob and Gary think maybe this would be a nice thing to do for Jimmy?  They asked you to buy it?  Not even a thought?  No, no.  So you lost a nice thing to do?  Oh.  Yeah.  No, no, I went to there.  No, Rob's going to pay me. 
[02:56:00]  I just like pointing out all the times they fail.  Of course.  Add it to the list.  Can you start that list, Sam?  Thanks.  No, I was going to go downtown to get a nice birthday cake, but by the time I got up, it  would have been melted.  Is it really a Ben and Jerry's cake?  It's a Ben and Jerry's cake, yeah.  Because this asshole tweeted a picture of you at Ben and Jerry's, like, look, he can't even  help himself.  Look what he's having for lunch.  Oh, no, I had to wait, like, 20 minutes because the woman had to put the stuff on and they  were waiting for the cake to come in.  Is it a good cake?  It's a chocolate with vanilla ice cream. 
[02:56:30]  Yay!  So it's something that everybody would enjoy, so it's not something obscure.  Apparently, Sandy Kane, that cunt, is saying nasty things about Sam Roberts and the show  on her Facebook.  Yeah, she's been saying, but I don't know, I doubt that that's a legitimate Facebook page  because she's typing on Facebook at times when she would obviously be in Times Square.  Would be in Times Square, yeah.  Shilling.  There's a rumor.  There's some fake Sandy Kane accounts out there.  You just have to think logically.  Could Sandy Kane operate Facebook? 
[02:57:00]  No.  Exactly.  Ugh.  Fucking bitch.  No, plus, I even get any ice cream for myself when I'm there, either.  That's fine.  Oh, Roland, you should have.  Say, hold back.  Good for you.  All right, well, this guy was...  The guy could go fuck himself.  Exactly.  Wow.  He'd die of AIDS today.  Oh, holy shit, today.  That would be some quick AIDS.  That takes a while, though.  Yeah.  The AIDS.  Jimmy, you're back?  Fast acting AIDS.  Yes, you probably have to keep...  We all put our helmet heads in your ice cream.  Oh, that's fine.  You should have waited until it was in my mouth.  This guy's quick. 
[02:57:30]  It just never ends.  Jimmy's quick.  The gang is...  The gang jokes never do end.  No.  Yes, neither does the lifestyle.  Should I take the break?  Well, yeah, I have to cut the cake with this plastic...  I know, the plastic...  By the way, I do want to thank everybody for getting my cake from Dwayne Reed.  Thank you, guys.  Oh, no, that, by the way.  Ben Jerry's.  Did you read it?  Can you say Ben and Jerry's?  Oh, happy birthday, Chip.  I didn't even see that.  It's Ben Jerry's.  Thank you.  Ben Jerry's.  Ooh.  Ben Jerry's.  It looks like it's somebody's birthday. 
[02:58:00]  It says happy birthday, Chip, on it.  Yes, it does.  Very good.  Thank you, guys.  And now...  Because there's nothing easier to cut than a frozen ice cream cake with a plastic fucking...  That's hard to cut.  That's not about the knife I got talking to.  Oh, literal Chip birthday, Jim.  Who are you talking to?  What?  Wait a minute.  About bringing a knife to cut a birthday cake?  Are you shitting me?  Is there a rule now...  You can't bring knives into it.  You can't bring a knife in to cut a cake.  The big one.  The big knife.  Why?  Why?  Why?  I got it.  What would they like you to cut your birthday fucking cake with? 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  Probably because they make people angry and they probably think they'll get stuck.  Really?  Ah.  Flamethrower.  How about they have some of the lawyers bring down legal documents?  I'm sure there's enough of them we could slice something with.  So we're not allowed to have big knives, but we have all these glass walls that we could  throw bosses through.  Yeah.  Have you thought about that?  Throw them through.  Shards of glass.  Right.  Not only have I thought about it, but I picked out individual windows for certain people.  Names etched on the bottom of each window.  It's supposed to be a joke. 
[02:59:00]  Obama with his bomb.  Oh.  You see that one?  Do we have that today?  I hope we do.  We'll do it after the break.  We're going to cut some cake.  Yeah, Obama had a fucking bomb.  You guys missed the Obama bomb?  It was a great bomb.  We'll have it after the break.  Stay there.  Yeah.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  It's a good boy's phone and his naughty boy's phone 
[02:59:30]  It's a good boy's phone and his naughty boy's phone  It's a good boy's phone and his naughty boy's phone  It's a good boy's phone and his naughty boy's phone 
[03:00:00]  It's viewer birthday time.  Today's birthdays, of course, include the ones we missed on Friday and also today's.  Happy 14th birthday to Gina Reed. 
[03:00:30]  Birthday wishes from your mom and dad, your brothers Eric and John,  your grandparents, aunts and uncles, lucky and admittance.  Happy 41st birthday to Ted Sheckler.  Birthday wishes from your mom, dad, Uncle Paul and Steve C.  The Virus Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony.  If you're going to have a...  Can we take this out of here? 
[03:01:00]  It's not even shaped like a piece of cake.  More Sabbath for Jimmy's birthday.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  I hope you guys enjoyed all the gifts we gave you today.  I did.  I enjoyed my cake and the conversation and my cake.  And then there was that other thing we did for you.  Club Soda Kenny is just infuriating to everyone alive.  We all know Kenny doesn't really treat himself ever.  But he just said to Jimmy, I can't disrespect you. 
[03:01:30]  I have to have a piece of your cake.  Yeah.  He...  How big is his piece of cake, Jimmy?  It's the two saddest cake slivers I've ever seen in my life.  Oh, my God.  It's not even a piece of cake.  Kenny, why wouldn't you just enjoy it and get a nice big piece of cake for Jimmy's birthday?  I did enjoy and partake in the celebration.  It was two bites.  That's more than I've seen Kenny eat in years, though. 
[03:02:00]  That was Kenny's idea, getting wild.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kenny was going off the rails right there.  Could you take this away, though, Kenny?  Because I don't want to eat anymore.  I've had enough cake.  Oh.  Two small pieces.  Boy, that went kind of quickly.  Yeah.  Amazing.  Do you know I haven't eaten since yesterday?  That cereal we had was the last time I ate until today.  What?  What are you doing?  I don't know.  Why?  You said that the other day, too.  I think I'm sick.  Of eating?  What's that?  No.  I'm sick of having man tits. 
[03:02:30]  I've never seen, by the way, a shirt that needed cake on it as badly as yours.  Oh, my God.  When he lifted that up, you could have plastered that.  If I had one ounce of courage, I would have mushed.  If he wasn't a double black belt, I would have mushed cake on his shirt.  Because he was in perfect position.  You think the same shit I do.  Yeah.  Like that one day, you're going to say the wrong thing to Kenny.  He's going to choke you out, right?  No.  Kenny has good control.  Kenny doesn't worry about me.  He could choke you out, though.  Kenny doesn't need to prove himself.  He's not scary because you know he could kill you and so does he. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, that's true.  You'd have to really put...  Oh.  I guess E-Rock's done for the day.  E-Rock.  There goes E-Rock.  I love how he just fucking grabs his butt.  E-Rock.  Why is he done...  Are you done for the day?  He goes back to...  What?  Is he done for the day?  No.  He goes back to...  I love seeing that.  He's done for the day.  He cuts bits for 10 o'clock.  E-Rock, are you done?  You're done?  He's not.  You just left your post.  So your bag and your...  We just noticed you left your post.  ...walking off post. 
[03:03:30]  You were AWOL.  I wanted you to...  You're in your backpack and you were out of here.  What's going on?  Is that true?  Yeah.  Oh my God, I just...  What?  We have a...  What?  Do you want me to just tell you a...  Yeah.  Another birthday surprise.  Kenny just told me something and I don't know if Kenny wants to make the announcement.  Uh-oh.  It's another birthday surprise.  The virus wants to tell Jimmy a joke for his birthday.  Oh my God.  This is unbelievable.  All right.  This is the perfect birthday party.  Oh, now we're talking.  I love jokes. 
[03:04:00]  Now we're talking.  Oh, this is wonderful.  Oh, that's great.  You should go outside so we can introduce you.  Baby elephant walk.  The virus is going to tell a joke for Jimmy's birthday.  You know what's the funniest part about this is?  He was down the hall skipping, thinking, I got my backpack.  I'm back in the office.  I skated today.  I skated.  The abuse wasn't too bad today.  There was only one fat joke very early on.  A couple of, I might have eaten the Kittner boy jokes.  But after that, free and clear. 
[03:04:30]  Well, I guess since it's Jim's birthday, Jim would like, what, Kenny to announce the virus?  Yeah, Kenny.  I think it's only appropriate.  Ladies and gentlemen, on this special day, I present to you the virus on Jimmy's birthday.  Hi, virus. 
[03:05:00]  Hi, guys.  All right.  Hey, virus.  It's Jimmy's birthday.  I'm here to get you to 10.  That's pretty funny right there.  How about...  But it's all about the punchline, though.  Yeah, how about a birthday joke?  Joke about the birthday.  One joke about Jimmy's birthday.  One anecdote about a birthday.  You know how people have their birthdays, and some smartest has always got a joke about, 
[03:05:30]  you know, oh, I'm getting another year older, or...  How many candles are on the cake?  Ah, it's their birthday again.  Who gives a fuck?  You know, shit like that.  Parties.  There's so many opportunities to come up with a humorous anecdote, or a joke, or a riddle,  or something.  Maybe one about your own life.  Right.  Sure.  An experience you had.  Let's go.  Oh, you know what?  We could use the Obama joke as an example.  Oh, very good.  Or should we do that afterwards?  I think we should do this as a what not to do.  No, we should do it afterwards, because it gives the virus too much time to think of  a joke.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:06:00]  We have a...  Uh-oh.  Okay.  Ice cream cake, and a sweet birthday boy.  Oh, no.  Just so you know.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Yep, you're still a virgin.  Wow.  That's an ice cream caker.  Oh.  How fast does that happen to you?  Immediately.  You don't understand.  My body's like, get it out, get it out, get it out.  I think the virus has something. 
[03:06:30]  Oh.  Oh, virus?  It's a lump.  Did you hear the one about...  Start there.  Maybe you start with a setup about birthdays.  Yeah.  A lot of dead air, virus.  Sandy Cain's subpoena and wave off your fart.  Use one piece of shit to wave off another.  Oh, God, that is bad.  Oh, fuck.  That's my gift.  You got this, Eric.  Come on.  Come on, virus. 
[03:07:00]  Who?  All right, virus.  Come on, virus.  You need a setup first.  What's the matter?  Breathe in.  What's the matter?  And go for it.  You got a hard on?  There's a very sour smell heading this way.  Speaking of sour.  Good one.  That wasn't...  Yeah.  You don't have to tell us it wasn't.  Feel picked up on that.  Wow, Jimmy. 
[03:07:30]  Jesus.  Jimmy has left his mark on his birthday.  That was my birthday wishes.  I like to spit them back out and say thank you.  Were you pushing out your 42nd year?  Yeah, that was 43 years of propulsion.  Oh, that's good.  Oh, he's got something.  He was just mouthing something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Cool.  He's got a joke.  Hopefully it was his last will and testament.  Good, virus.  Wow, that stinks.  Punchline now.  Birthday punchline in 3, 2, 1.  Go. 
[03:08:00]  You got to at least start with the setup.  So it's Jim's birthday today.  Holy hooly.  So it's Jim's birthday today.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's right, virus.  Yeah, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And?  And it's so much.  You could say something like, it's Jim's birthday.  That reminds me of a story.  It's Jim's birthday. 
[03:08:30]  Did you hear the one about?  Yeah, there's so many things you could do.  Just trying to help you out a little bit there.  You hear the one about the chubby kid that couldn't improv?  Here's the one about the kid with the Cornish game hen body?  Oh.  God.  Uh.  Well.  Let's go.  Anything?  Time's a waste.  So it's Jim's birthday.  It was the last thing we heard, right?  Right.  Maybe redo the setup? 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  And then go right into the joke part.  Bing.  Setup.  You can do it.  Right into it.  No fucking delays.  Hey, everyone.  It's Jim Norton's birthday.  Yeah.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess that no delay part didn't work very well.  One joke about birthdays.  Jimmy's getting a bit older.  Yeah.  Maybe there's a joke about getting old. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  Maybe a little joke about age.  Yeah.  Maybe there was too much fire on that birthday cake because too many candles.  Yeah.  Things like that.  The cake itself.  Yeah.  Sexual prowess after a few years.  Yes.  I don't know.  Yes.  Something about a Kardashian limo crashing through my cake.  Right.  Killing two of the candles.  Anything.  Scott in Quakertown.  What goes up and never comes down?  Your age. 
[03:10:00]  And then you're out.  That's right.  Ah.  See.  It's not the greatest punchline, but it's a punchline.  It's simple enough to stop this fucking music.  Let's go, Byers.  At least do a setup again.  I was going to say the challenger, but.  Oh.  So what is the setup?  Hey, guys.  It's Jim Norton's birthday.  Jim Norton's birthday.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  One punchline done.  All eyes on you, dude. 
[03:10:30]  Here it is.  Let's go.  One punchline and done.  Let her rip.  Let her rip.  Let her rip.  Here we go.  Did Jimmy blow out his candles through a hole in the bathroom stall?  Ah.  See.  That's a good one.  That would work.  Glory hole joke.  And you missed it.  Someone else got it.  That's right.  Let's go.  And one birthday punchline.  That means he'll be blowing on the candle of a tranny later. 
[03:11:00]  Oh.  There you go.  One.  One.  One punchline.  Blowing candle jokes.  Yeah.  But now you can't use those.  Come up with something funny and different.  Thank you, stink throttle.  That was stink throttle, huh?  Yeah.  The one and only.  Of course it was.  Some are imitating the stink throttle, but we all know there's only one.  There are no duplicates.  Original stink throttle.  Come on.  Let's go.  Let me down on my birthday.  Punchline. 
[03:11:30]  Virus.  Jimmy's birthday.  It's my birthday.  Anything.  Frosting.  Yeah.  Something about ice cream cake.  Ice cream cake.  Fattening food.  I sure hope.  Right.  Gifts.  I sure hope Fezzy could handle the fact that someone else is getting attention today.  Are you out of your fucking mind?  Have you just about lost your fucking mind?  Whoa.  See, that was just insulting to Fezzy.  Wow.  That was a shot.  Oh, boy.  How's he supposed to take the stick when people like that are throwing rocks like that? 
[03:12:00]  Sorry.  Sorry to Fezzy.  I was just making a joke.  It's Jimmy's birthday.  All eyes on Jimmy.  Virus.  You got the floor.  Go.  Come on, Virus.  Punchline now.  You can do it.  Here it comes.  Hey, guys.  It's Jim Norton's birthday.  That's right, Virus. 
[03:12:30]  Stop and buy it for the big birthday party.  And...  Oh, no.  My God, man.  What are you doing, you goldfish memory?  Why don't we give him a little time and play the Obama thing?  We have at least two hours so far.  Play the Obama bomb.  Dude.  Really?  Yeah.  I thought he had something.  He has nothing.  Can we tear down the curtain a little bit?  Yeah.  This is not a bit.  No, I know.  Yeah.  This idiot can't come up with one punchline. 
[03:13:00]  Sorry.  Yeah, we continue doing this bit.  That's why.  Yeah, that's why it's funny.  That was just an insult.  Of course that's why we do it.  If you came up with punchlines, we wouldn't do it.  Yeah.  Wouldn't be good.  If you were rattling off punchlines, this character would so go away.  Yeah.  Of course.  We'd be like, wow.  All right.  It looks funny.  Obama bomb.  We'll just hear the Obama bomb.  Turn down that music for a second as the virus thinks.  And then you'll be able to, you know...  Here's the Obama bomb.  Now, last but not least, back in the 80s, Richard was also a five-time Jeopardy champion  and a semifinalist in the Tournament of Champions. 
[03:13:30]  Not too shabby.  That's why all his confirmation, all his answers at his confirmation hearings will be in the  form of a question.  That's a joke.  So, I am proud of Richard Cordray.  A presidential bomb.  A bomb of presidential proportions.  Obama is a nerd. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  I'm telling you...  Jimmy turned me on to that.  Bush was a funnier...  He's a Harvard dude.  Bush was a funnier guy.  Yeah.  Because he was a more blue-collar...  Right.  Obama is a very nerdy guy.  He's a dork.  He'll be saying all of it.  He just blew it.  He's terribly unfunny.  He's got one?  Yeah, get back to the movie because the virus turned his head.  He's working out a line right now as we speak.  Here we go.  Let's go, virus.  We're back to you.  We've got enough time.  Set up and let's go. 
[03:14:30]  He interrupted the bit.  Let's go.  We stopped the bit for you.  All eyes and ears on you.  And begin.  Go.  Hey, guys.  Come on.  Start with the setup at least.  Hi, guys.  Hi, virus.  In case you didn't know, it's Jim Norton's birthday.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you. 
[03:15:00]  One joker-o.  One joker-o.  Hey, guys.  It's Jim Norton's birthday.  All right.  Great.  After the show today, Jim will go home, blow a tranny, stuff himself full of ice cream, 
[03:15:30]  and try not to kill himself.  Oh, wait.  That's every day.  Just get out.  What the fuck was that?  He has all that time to think one thing up.  And then he just states, actually, what would be a good day for me.  And then it's like, yeah.  Now you just get about...  Depressed Jimmy.  Yeah.  I just want to be reminded that his life sucks.  You just said facts.  Oh, are you all right, dude?  Yeah, but where's the joke?  He's just saying facts.  Two Jews walk into a bar because the door opened. 
[03:16:00]  Where's the twist?  That was awful.  Just said things that happened.  That was really just not nice.  Very mean-spirited.  Yeah, yeah.  No real humor involved.  It was just mean.  It wasn't funny.  His delivery wasn't good.  You want to hear the Obama thing one more time?  Kevin from Connecticut.  Yes, of course.  Obama.  Yes.  Obama.  Obama is terrible at delivering a joke.  He's a nerd, man.  You're so right.  He's terrible at everything.  And him muffing that part where he had to repeat it. 
[03:16:30]  And that was a key part.  All of the answers will be in the question.  I meant he's terrible at everything as far as all this shit goes.  He's not a good off-the-cuff guy.  He panics.  As smart as he is, he panics.  He's horrible.  Let's hear it again.  Now, last but not least, back in the 80s, Richard was also a five-time Jeopardy! champion.  And a semi-finalist in the Tournament of Champions.  Not too shabby.  That's why all his confirmation, all his answers at his confirmation hearings will be in the form of a question. 
[03:17:00]  That's a joke.  Oh.  So, I am proud to nominate Richard Cordray.  Oh, the confirmation!  God.  Oh, did he bomb.  But, you see, it would have been funnier if he said...  Be more funny!  If he said that was a joke, or a bomb masquerading as a joke.  Yeah, yeah.  That would have killed.  He doesn't know how to do that. 
[03:17:30]  You know what I mean?  Obama's speech delivery is a terrible joke delivery.  Because everything sounds like a punchline's coming, so it just sounds hokey.  Yeah, yeah.  The, uh...  His cadence is not good for jokes.  It's like his speeches.  Yeah.  Which, it works for a speech, but, uh, doesn't quite work for a joke.  Oh, you're admitting that it works for speeches, are you?  Oh, I've always said that he can tell a speech.  He can give a speech.  That's how he got elected.  He just can't be a president. 
[03:18:00]  He can tell a speech.  Give a speech, I know.  He can tell a speechy story.  I still, I say that I know what our Hard Rock show should be.  What's that?  I'm telling you, Stand Up by the Staff should happen at the Hard Rock Cafe.  That was a good one.  What else?  People are going to come see us, but that would be something for people to come and look forward to.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Next Thursday we're doing that?  I think so.  Five minutes.  That's all they need to do, right?  They each do five minutes.  Five.  Five.  Just say three. 
[03:18:30]  Whatever.  Three.  I'm serious.  Five will be a lot of pressure on them.  That's like a TV set when they do, like, Last Comic Standing.  I don't think they do a four or five.  I think that would be very funny for the fans to watch.  My equipment banging off the microphone as I back up.  America's Got Talent does two minutes.  Opie and Anthony broadcasting live from the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square before the SiriusXM Celebrity Fantasy Football Draft.  Next Thursday we'll be there live from 8 to 10 a.m.  A lot of the guests already confirmed and things to do. 
[03:19:00]  Details on how to RSVP for the event will be available online very, very soon.  Wait, do they have to RSVP or can they just come?  Oh, God.  Are you serious?  Not the RSVP shit.  Just show the fuck up.  Just show up.  God damn.  We're going to have 10 people there?  What's RSVP?  Come on.  Why do we have to know who's coming?  For what?  Well, you can only fit so many people.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Because the Hard Rock Cafe is not a fucking cotillion. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah.  Our show is going to shut down Times Square.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're holding a debutante ball.  If they expect people to RSVP and only those are the ones allowed in, this is going to be a bomb and I want nothing to do with it.  I'm telling you, people should just come to fucking Hard Rock.  They're not going to allow that.  Just show the fuck up.  I love that.  And there's too many people that you can't come in.  But then you say, sorry, we're at capacity.  That's how bars work.  That's how clubs work.  That's how everywhere works. 
[03:20:00]  You pack it out.  They will go to great lengths to make sure we can't get the most people we can possibly get in one place.  They will go to great lengths to fuck everything up.  Stop with the RSVPs.  It's silly.  It doesn't work.  No.  It doesn't work.  We'll tell you when you can RSVP between 10.02 and 10.05 online.  And here's the URL.  HTTP slash slash colon www.3b.com. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  Details on how to RSVP will be available online very soon.  Good thing you're not vague about it a week out.  That stinks.  We should be right now on the air saying, we're doing this.  Here's the date.  Come on down and join us.  What the frig?  I'm not doing it.  That's it now?  Yeah, I'm done. 
[03:21:00]  Oh, boy.  I got to go to a museum tonight.  A museum?  What?  Natural history?  Fuck.  I'm MoMA.  Nazi memorabilia?  I'm MoMA all the way, brother.  MoMA?  I'm a MoMA guy.  You fucking MoMA.  Yeah.  I've been spelling it wrong.  MoMA sexual?  Why are you going to MoMA?  MoMA.  MoMA.  I don't want to say.  Why?  I don't understand you.  Don't be shy.  I'm being so nervous.  My street video is going to be part of a huge exhibit. 
[03:21:30]  Some of your etchings?  What's the exhibit?  It's not just my street videos.  A lot of street videos.  What's the exhibit?  I was recruited to be a major contributor to a new website called MyBlockNYC.com.  I'm MoMA, and I want to recruit you.  What's it called?  MyBlockNYC.com.  Okay, MyBlockNYC.  It's a grid of New York City, and then you click on streets to see if any videos were filmed there.  Oh, okay.  And they recruited me.  Major contributor, and their exhibit goes live, I think, tonight. 
[03:22:00]  It's the opening night.  So how long have you known this?  I mentioned it.  Maybe you weren't here.  I mentioned it one other time.  You should be plugging the shit out of it.  It's a side project.  It's not going to be for everybody that listens to the show.  So what?  Everybody wouldn't come.  I'm saying right now.  You should plug that, man.  You should plug it.  No, it's not open to the public.  Today is just the big opening.  Oh, they can't come down?  Well, they can, and then the exhibit goes live.  So if you happen to find yourself in MoMA, you could check out this exhibit. 
[03:22:30]  MyBlockNYC.com is just a small part of this huge exhibit they're doing.  Yeah.  Exhibit?  Where is MoMA?  I'm pretty psyched.  I think we drive by it every day.  It's off, what, 6th Avenue?  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think it's 5th Avenue.  There's a museum of...  Museum of Modern Art.  Isn't MoMA on the west side more?  No, it's right around here, man.  Wasn't sure.  So, yeah, I'm pretty psyched about it, to be honest with you.  Oh, I'm thinking of the Guggenheim.  Okay, I don't know where MoMA is.  Oh, the Guggenheim.  Gonna hang with some artsy fucks tonight.  The addition on there. 
[03:23:00]  Design.  Are you nervous?  No, I don't have to.  I'm just, I'm there to represent the filmmakers.  Me and a few other guys.  No.  Anyone can upload to the site, but they picked me and a few others to really represent the site tonight.  So, yeah, I'm happy.  I'm psyched.  Absolutely.  That's cool.  Down there, museum.  Get a little culture.  Yeah.  Some of those, just walking around with a camera, being a lunatic, paid off a little  bit.  So, you're going to, are you going to speak at all?  I don't know. 
[03:23:30]  I don't know what they got planned, to be totally honest with you.  I'm not sure.  I think I'm just hobnobbing with some artsy assholes.  Hob knob.  So, we'll see.  Yeah.  It's getting a lot of attention, this website.  A lot of articles are going to be coming out in the next few weeks.  How long is the?  TV pieces and stuff.  It's pretty big, actually.  How long is the exhibit going on for?  Three and a half months.  Oh, okay.  But the website will continue after that.  But this is the big launch.  The site just went live only a couple days ago.  So, it's growing.  All right.  Good.  My block NYC.com, if you want to check it out. 
[03:24:00]  My handle on there is also OP Radio.  I think I got like 14 street videos up there right now.  More to be added.  So, it has nothing to do with the radio show.  Did you have to list where the blocks are?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  So, I'm like the king of street videos on the west side.  They have like links on the map.  Yeah.  If you go on the map and you see like a yellow, that means a video is shot on that block.  Oh, wow.  It's pretty cool.  Some of the videos are a waste of time, but there's some real cool shit up there. 
[03:24:30]  So, you can just look at your block and go see if there's any videos.  That's why I can't do the Otto and George thing today, because I'm doing this.  I got to tell Otto.  I haven't told him yet.  Oh, one of my videos is being featured right now, matter of fact.  Oh.  That real weird artsy one I made.  Does Otto think you're doing it?  Well, he wrote me late yesterday.  Oh, okay.  I would love to do his thing, and I can't, because I'm going to the museum.  MoMA.  MoMA.  MoMA.  So, if you find yourself in MoMA, look for the exhibit. 
[03:25:00]  Mo.  Mo.  And myblocknyc.com is a part of.  Mo.  Mo.  I'll go when I come back.  I'll come back on next Tuesday.  Oh, that would be wonderful.  Is this cool?  I've only been there once.  I went once.  I don't really get it.  From the Disney Wild Animal Park?  Oh, sorry.  That's Floppy Balls.  Floppy Balls is in the park every Saturday.  Floppy Balls.  Well, that guy's playing.  Didn't that piano get stolen?  That piano is being played by a black man, and yes, there is a pink gorilla on the side  of the piano.  Oh, Jesus.  So, this pretty much shut down the show. 
[03:25:30]  Which is good, because it is over.  Yeah, it's time to go.  Happy birthday to Jim Norton.  Thanks.  Jimmy, happy birthday.  I'll be in another weird world tonight that I'm not used to.  Maybe I'll have a couple stories.  I don't know.  Stories?  Oh, and Jimmy's going to L.A.  Tomorrow.  I go with Sam to San Diego.  But he's doing the show tomorrow, right?  I'm here tomorrow for Comic-Con.  Comic-Con.  You too.  You're going to shack up together?  Same room?  One bed?  No, Sirius put the guys in a different hotel than... 
[03:26:00]  In a halfway house?  Well, I'm actually farther away.  Oh, you're staying tonight's show accommodations.  Yes.  Oh, well, that's probably a little different, I bet.  What motel six is Sam going to be at?  Oh, really?  Fully infested fucking...  They let me stay at whatever hotel I could find.  They did?  Yeah.  So, Sam is...  Hopefully, we'll travel, because I'm doing double duty.  I'm doing a shoot for tonight's show, and then doing some serious stuff. 
[03:26:30]  So, hopefully, Sam will just travel with us.  I'm going to try to see if Sam can meet at my hotel.  In your hotel room, setting off firecrackers while you do cocaine.  I want to give Sam a good buggering.  All right, let's go home, then.  The motoring plays.  Listen to this.  Listen to this.  Listen to this.  It's my favorite part.  Dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan.  He's so psyched.  Okay, Jimmy just farted.  Take it easy.  Jimmy, I hope you really appreciate the birthday show.  I do. 
[03:27:00]  There was a lot of effort that went into this today.  Dumbbell has headphones on.  I can't...  Oh, my God.  Bye, Anthony.  Bye, Anthony.  It's horrible.  Take it easy.  Stay for the after show.  Who's on the hotline?  Stay for the after show.  Why?  The after show started.  Who's on...  It hasn't started yet.  No, it has not.  Who's on the hotline?  Theater of the Mind.  Troy, if you want to remind Jimmy, you can tell me he's got oceanfront accommodations in San Diego.  Kenny just called up and said, hey, Troy, if you want to...  Fucking Kenny.  You're on the air, Kenny.  Kenny, it's us.  Who is it? 
[03:27:30]  He's just this dumb thing.  This guy doesn't know nothing.  Kenny, what do you got?  No, I just wanted to remind Jimmy he has oceanfront accommodations in San Diego.  Oh, thank you, Kenny, for reminding me.  I appreciate it.  Very, very cool.  Yeah, I don't.  And happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, buddy.  I'm going to see you in two minutes.  Thank you.  Bye.  Is it nice out?  Maybe I'll walk home today, Kenny.  It's gorgeous out.  It's hot as balls.  Language!  I don't advise it.  I'm going to take my shirt off and walk.  Yes!  Fuck, let's follow slowly in the car. 
[03:28:00]  That's not what it used to be.  How many gay jokes are we going to do?  That's not what it used to be.  It's still good, though.  I'm fucking...  I'm fucking doing push-ups every second of the day now.  All right, Kenny, we'll see you in a little bit.  Bye.  Bye.  All right, out we go.  Jimmy, I didn't promote it because it's not a public event yet.  Oh, okay.  I was saying you should promote it.  It's just the opening, and I do hope people go there.  But the reality is it's a side project, and the majority of our listeners probably wouldn't  find it fascinating, but some will.  Everything we do...  Troy, I'm an artist now. 
[03:28:30]  I'm going to be a MoMA.  It's great.  Compared to the radio show, everything is a side project.  My stand-up, Ant's Compound, or...  Your stand-up is not a side project.  But meaning it's not...  When it comes to the radio show, it's a different thing.  Right.  So anything any of us do, whether it's fucking Red Eye or this, it's all outside stuff,  so you should promote it the way we do.  Troy's DJ gigs.  Plug it.  Really?  It's a fucking...  It's another thing besides the radio show.  Well, there might be some interest in some TV, but not anything to talk about yet.  Plug it, and I want money. 
[03:29:00]  I'll plug when I got something concrete, but the street video thing, it's kind of weird.  It's starting to take off a little bit.  Yeah.  I've sold a few videos to Japan, and I don't know.  It's just a weird little fucking thing.  All right.  Can we leave, Sam?  Well, the after show hasn't started, so you're not under my jurisdiction right now.  Jimmy did the whole after show with you yesterday.  I know.  It was a lot of fun.  Yeah, it was like 11-17.  I did into Ron and Fez time, too.  Yeah.  Are you going to ask Ronnie about the Fez Ignation and how...  No, I don't know.  ...how bad that could be?  See you guys tomorrow.  I got to go. 
[03:29:30]  All right.  I know you do time with Ronnie.  Are you going to bring it up?  I don't know, because...  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  I already end up getting blamed for a lot of stuff, so I feel like if I bring it up,  all of a sudden, instead of just asking questions, I'm a shit-stirrer again.  Yeah.  So maybe I'll just be better off if I don't open my mouth at all.  Okay.  Should I wear my Target hat to the moment tonight?  Yeah, that's classy.  It is.  $7, dude.  I'm going to get my $7 Target hat washed for the big exhibit tonight. 
[03:30:00]  Well, keep in mind, like, you're an artist now.  You're sort of in the hipster community, where it's like, you would wear Target stuff ironically.  Like, yeah, man.  Oh.  You know what I mean?  I like how you think.  Like, you don't try to dress to impress.  You're an artist.  You let your work speak for itself.  I did try to dress today.  What's the problem with the outfit today?  No, nothing.  I mean, you look great.  You notice the hole in the shirt?  Then what'd you try to dress for?  There's a hole in your shirt.  I didn't realize until I left the house. 
[03:30:30]  I gotta do some shopping.  You get, like, an ironic T-shirt or something to wear.  What is it?  Think, think, think.  What would Troi Kwan wear?  Because that's the vibe you should be putting out now that you're, like, a video artist.  I don't want to look like an asshole.  Oh, so you're not going to...  Sorry, no Troi Kwan.  My Lady Gaga video?  Oof.  Getting a lot of hits?  Speaking of stepping in another world, oof.  Getting attacked by all the little monsters.  The little monsters are all over Twitter attacking you. 
[03:31:00]  They're pissed off at me because I didn't understand why the girl was crying.  And then I confronted the kid because there is a weird psycho thing that I do have in my head.  Right.  When he said he was calling the police on me, I lost it for a split second.  You attacked him for a moment.  And by the way, the little kid did hit me.  He hit you?  He hit me and shut my camera down.  Oh.  But I kept rolling.  If you look at the video, you'll see a hand go across the screen.  That's not me hitting him.  He, he, wait.  It's not me hitting him.  Yeah, yeah, you said it right.  It was him hitting me.  I got hit. 
[03:31:30]  And he was trying to slap your camera down.  Yeah, but he got me.  And you were, like, not happening.  So if I was a complete lunatic, I would have, you know...  Hit him back.  Had to do something about that.  But I did not.  That's the new old me.  But all the little monsters are attacking me.  And what I would have to say to them is, leave me alone.  I was born this way.  Exactly.  Don't you understand that shit?  You're an artist.  You were born this way.  I'm not even going with the art thing.  If I'm an asshole and a jerk, why are you attacking me?  Just like Lady Gaga doesn't want people to attack you people. 
[03:32:00]  Don't attack me.  I was born this way.  But then you're still attacking them.  Nah, I was asking some tough questions.  I didn't attack nobody.  I was confused by the fact that the girl was crying because of Lady Gaga.  So I wanted to ask some questions.  Then you got in the kid's face and threateningly said, do you know who I am?  I didn't say I was going to beat him up or nothing.  No.  It wasn't a five-year-old at a playground.  It was more the tone.  And I do love that story about you cursing out the little five-year-old and saying, I don't care how old you are, I'll beat the shit out of you. 
[03:32:30]  Wait till you have a kid, Sam.  Then you'll understand that shit.  I mean, I believe it.  I'm not saying it's normal, but it makes you do stupid things.  So why are the monsters attacking me?  Because if their anthem is, you know, I was born this way.  They don't like it.  I was born this way.  You were born that way.  They don't like it when people question the ways of Mother Monster.  Just go with it.  I was just showing the hypocrisy because I had a camera in that kid's face. 
[03:33:00]  He's going to call the police because I have a camera in his face, but he has his camera in Lady Gaga's face.  Now explain that to me.  Well, he's not a public figure.  And Gaga is like a super public figure.  He's now a public figure.  But you've made him a public figure.  Because he made Opie's Eye, which we all know is...  Mega.  It's pretty big now.  Well, he's going to end up in MoMA.  Let's be honest.  Oh, you know what?  I did put that video on myblocknyc.com.  So there is a possibility it will be in the MoMA Museum. 
[03:33:30]  So all the MoMA videos are coming from My Block NYC?  No.  I'm picking some of my videos from my YouTube page and putting them also on My Block NYC.  But I've got to do some exclusive videos from My Block as well.  So people are going to start having to check both out?  For the most part, if you just follow the YouTube channel, OP Radio, you'll see all the videos for the most part.  But you'll tweet it all, right?  Yeah.  If I have to do an exclusive for My Block, that's fine.  I'll tweet it when that happens.  Just do whatever you want. 
[03:34:00]  Whatever.  You know.  Just find the videos.  You know where the websites are.  Just look at the videos.  Oh, nice video.  All right.  Make sure you talk about the Fezzik Nation.  I get labeled as a shit-stirer when I do that.  I'm telling you to bring it up with Ronnie because I'm very concerned.  And I want Fezzy to know that that was just an off-the-cuff improv from Jimmy.  All right.  Well, what about when you took a shot at Fez while the virus was in here doing improv?  What did I say? 
[03:34:30]  I don't even really want to repeat what you said.  I don't remember what I said, so you might as well.  You said when the virus was in here, is Fez going to be upset that somebody's paying attention to someone other than him today?  Is what you said.  I'm paraphrasing maybe, but that's what you said.  Sam, have fun with fucking Fez with that one today.  That's not what I said.  That's what you said.  I can't believe you would bring that up again on the radio unless you wanted to stir some shit.  This is what I'm talking about.  Way to go. 
[03:35:00]  Way to go.  I try to get to the bottom of things.  Way to go.  That was a test.  And I failed?  Of course you failed.  Shit.  We were not going to mention that anymore.  But why?  Because it was yours instead of Jim's?  No.  I mean, it happened a while ago, but now it's really fresh in everyone's ears.  It just happened like 25 minutes ago.  Bring it up with Ronnie.  See what he thinks.  I don't think that's a good idea.  Good luck with that.  The virus.  Sirius XS.  Sirius XS.  Obi and Anthony. 
[03:35:30]  You're the only show.  Damn it.  Damn it.  Damn it.  Damn it. </pre>
