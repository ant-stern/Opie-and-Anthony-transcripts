<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a self-described "Shit Radio" segment. Opie recounted a reckless driving incident, followed by morbid anecdotes about his grandmother's death and unsanitary family practices, including a mattress soiled with various bodily fluids and linked to a crack-smoking prostitute.  This led to a discussion of bed bugs, fueled by caller accounts of infestations. The conversation then shifted to the "Tonight Show Wars" between Jay Leno and David Letterman,  and the demise of Air America Radio, with a caller identifying himself as "Mr. Motherfucker" offering his opinion.  The segment concluded with further Leno-Letterman discussion and an Opie correction regarding a musician mix-up.

The show then focused heavily on the New York Jets' playoff game against the Colts, featuring vulgar commentary on sports fans, betting predictions, and playful insults about fan bases and geographic origins. This transitioned into an unscripted, crude discussion of Prince's music and lyrics, with caller interpretations and an absurd, offensive song about the Pope.  The segment included mentions of upcoming guests: Bob Kelly, Punk Ass and Skyscraper from Tapout, and Steven Singer, along with sexually explicit discussion about a former intern and speculation about a staff member's sexual orientation.  There were also mentions of a Comedy Central stand-up competition and the movie *The Hurt Locker*.

The next segment centered on boosting Bobby Kelly's votes in a Comedy Central contest, involving allegations of vote rigging, sexually explicit conversations (including descriptions of various sexual acts and pornography), and a highly uncomfortable interview with a new intern about his sexuality.  Tammy Pescatelli called in to discuss the contest.  Punk Ass and Skyscraper from Tapout then appeared as guests, discussing MMA, Brock Lesnar's health, illegal underground fighting, and the Tapout brand.  Lesnar's intestinal issues were debated skeptically.

The following segment continued the MMA theme, focusing on Brock Lesnar, Fedor Emelianenko, Shane Carwin, Frank Mir, Randy Couture, Kimbo Slice, Rampage Jackson, and Forrest Griffin, including graphic descriptions of fights and injuries.  Tapout representatives called in, followed by a deeply personal account from Bobby Kelly about his abusive childhood.  The discussion returned to MMA, touching upon the Gracie family and martial arts movies. Steven Singer from Steven Singer Jewelers then visited the studio, gifting the hosts gold-dipped roses.  The segment concluded with sports predictions and casual conversation with a possible female auditionee for the show.

A later segment featured a female makeup artist aspiring to be a sports reporter. The hosts discussed her potential role, making sexually explicit comments about male genitalia size, locker room experiences, and her attractiveness.  They also discussed Tiger Woods' infidelity and other athletes' alleged affairs.  The conversation involved sexually suggestive banter, highlighting the guest's lack of sports knowledge. Steven Singer appeared again to plug his comedy shows.  The show ended with plugs for the hosts' events, a fly-fishing trip discussion, comments on a Miranda Kerr photo, and further sexually explicit commentary.  The extremely heavy studio door was also a recurring topic throughout the show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We've got to completely take down regular radio, we've got to fucking just destroy it.  I want it like it was where language was realistic and raw, sexual content is realistic, and just fucking people reacting with people is realistic. 
[00:00:30]  Sit the fuck back.  I'm being a trumpeter.  I've got a catchy name, Shit Radio.  Alright, we hit a low.  We have contact, oh my god, you're these faces all over her pussy.  Look at how small my butt hole is.  That's funny.  This is Shit Radio.  And it fucking stinks, it stinks.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the roll. 
[00:01:00]  Good morning, Mr. Breakfast.  A wonderful Friday morning.  Friday?  I like that.  Fucking early.  Nick of time.  What's up with this early shit?  I know.  What the fuck?  Who the fuck gets used to it?  Nah, not right off the bat. 
[00:01:30]  No.  Please.  Please, I beg you.  Please, I beg you.  The O.P. and Anthony Shoe.  Morning.  Bye, Dad.  Nice.  Got my water.  I'm all set.  You're all set, man.  That's Christ.  All right.  I drove it 120 miles an hour to get here.  Anthony had the best line when he walked in.  He said, there's nobody I pass on the road who doesn't remember me.  Yeah.  They remember me. 
[00:02:00]  And I saw this escalate driving like a maniac.  Where to begin?  Ah, nice.  Did you drive rudely?  I was so rude and without care or regard for anybody's safety.  Whatsoever.  Red light?  Ha ha.  I poo-poo you, red lights.  There's nothing better than a guy's, I drove like an asshole story when he just makes it 
[00:02:30]  into work.  I swear to God, it was a complete asshole.  I mean, crazy.  And the guy in front of me in the tunnel was like doing a decent clip and I was mad at him.  You know?  He's like, get out of my way.  Oh, he can't go anywhere.  It's fucking steel beams in between him and passing.  He can't really move out of, yeah, he can't move to the side whatsoever, so.  No.  I should be, I should be, like, amazed at the wonder that we're going under a river.  And I'm just like, out of my way! 
[00:03:00]  My grandmother would say, speedy skippy, if somebody sped by her.  No, she wouldn't.  Oh, yes, she would.  My grandmother would.  Speedy skippy?  Yeah, she held with you.  Hey, hooray for me.  No, I'm getting somewhere.  You're not.  Yeah.  Oh.  She alive?  No.  Oh, what'd she die of?  She was rear-ended, actually.  By Jimmy Norton.  No, her little heart gave out.  Aw.  Poor little gal.  Yes. 
[00:03:30]  How old was she?  She was in her 70s.  I was 19, and she, uh...  Aw.  We were in the house together, and she had a heart attack, and I had to run downstairs and  put nitroglycerin under her tongue.  No way.  But you put the explosive kind, and she exploded.  Yeah.  Her head blew off.  It was pop rocks.  You want to try to save your grandma at 19 years old?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I never knew this.  Yeah, but she, uh...  That's terrible.  It was okay.  Then she went to the hospital, and I think she might have come home again, and then she  went back, and she died.  That was a good decision on the doctor's part.  You're fine.  Go home.  Yeah, go ahead.  Here's your pogo stick. 
[00:04:00]  You'll be fine.  Here's your pogo stick and your bag of Coke.  Godspeed.  Yeah, no, no, no.  She might have died a week later.  That's kind of horrific, though, man.  Poor grandma.  It was sad, but...  With the nitroglycerin that you had to kind of step up like that.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was awful.  I was glad I was there, though.  I mean, you know, otherwise she would have died in the house, but she didn't.  Well, hooray for you.  You never want an older relative dying in your house.  It just ruins everything.  Ah.  It's creepy.  All you remember is the older person dead in your house somewhere after Christmas.  Don't sit in that chair. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  Wish I had a better story.  Had she died, eh, fucking Liddell choked her out.  You don't want that death chair or death bed room, something like that in your house.  You've got to leave.  Someone croaks in your house.  Fast forward.  Fast forward two years on that bed, and eat your girl's pussy who squirts.  That's right.  That was the grandma?  That was the bed, yeah.  It was the bed?  It was the bed, not the grandma.  It was, yeah.  That might have saved her life.  Well, the bed was used to having a lot of squirt on it.  It's amazing.  Grandma was sleeping in there. 
[00:05:00]  We kept that bed.  It's amazing how you don't, at that age, I was, I remember me and my buddy got, that  was the same room we got a prostitute in, a pregnant prostitute who sparked up a crack  pipe.  She was eight and a half months pregnant.  I remember that.  All the features.  Me and my buddy Larry got this hooker, and she sparked up a crack pipe, and then she blew both  to us.  I'm like, you can't smoke crack down here.  Come on, grandma.  I was sober.  I'm like, you can't smoke crack down here, because crack had a really weird smell.  In your mom's house?  Yeah.  Yeah, my parents were upstairs.  Weird, delicious, whatever you want to call it.  Well, I wasn't smoking at that point. 
[00:05:30]  Me and my friend were sober and leading by example.  You got sober at the wrong time.  You just missed crack.  I really did, dude.  You would have, oh, would you have been bad?  Jimmy on crack.  I smoked coke, but I never smoked crack.  Yeah.  No, I actually did, but I don't think I smoked it out of a crack pipe.  I think we smoked crack with pot.  We put it in joints and smoked it.  I'm glad I didn't smoke it out of a pipe, though.  It was just starting to think.  What is it about, like, mattresses back then that people just decided to keep them no  matter what?  They could look like fucking abstract paintings, and they're still just disgusting, and people 
[00:06:00]  would keep them.  Because getting a mattress is a pain in the ass.  That's why you kept it forever.  Was it, though, back then?  Oh, my God.  It was always a pain in the ass.  You tie it to your roof.  Pop is there holding it like it's going to do anything if it slides off the roof.  We've all had a mattress on our roof.  It's not fun.  So you say, fuck that.  I'll just keep sleeping on the same shit.  Literally.  Plus, you're poor.  It's blood.  Yeah, I think it was a money thing.  Plus, you're poor.  My time for me, I'll just buy another one.  Yeah.  Those damn mattresses are expensive.  No one really said anything, either, when you took the sheets off and, like, turned 
[00:06:30]  the mattress over.  And all the stains.  Because it was like a family thing.  Because, you know, you're there.  You see Pop's fucking jizz stains all over the damn thing when you take the sheets off.  Ah.  Just everything.  The one time, Mom had her period in the middle of the night.  They decided to fuck on the period, and it's just blood on it.  And you would just go, all right, we're helping Dad flip the mattress.  Urine stains.  What was Dad in?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Pissing.  One night, coming home, hammered and vomiting, shitting and pissing. 
[00:07:00]  I remember I was dating this Spanish girl.  She was older than me.  She was really sexy.  This is where I worked at fucking Christophe Silver.  And she was really sexy.  And, you know, I lived at home.  So I brought her home to my parents' house, and we slept in my parents' bed.  It was just creepy.  You know, like it was a parents' bed vibe.  That is foolish.  She was not turned on.  Yeah, she was not turned on at all.  That's bad.  And, yeah, that happened the first time with that buzz chick that took my virginity away.  It was on my father and his girlfriend at the time.  Ended up his wife later on.  But it was on their bed. 
[00:07:30]  And just in the room, it was creepy to be in there having this sexual experience.  Yeah.  And not in my little, you know, fucking day bed that they had in there.  My fucking, pretty much one of those reclining chairs.  That's what I slept on for years.  Thanks, Dad.  Laying in the same place that your father would get a rod and have pre-cum leaking out of it  and slap your mother on the ass with it.  Yuck.  And make that, oh, sound.  Wake up, wake up. 
[00:08:00]  And he jamming in.  Spitting to his hands.  You should have seen Buzz's big 70s Earth Mama muff.  With some of that hair on that bed.  Nice.  Make that proud.  Let's say hi to Bill in Georgia.  Bill.  Hello, Bill.  Hey, happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hi, Bill.  Thanks.  And you can't get rid of a good old mattress because it becomes part of the family, almost  literally, with 30 pounds of your dead skin cells and flesh and whatnot in it.  Wow.  Yeah, we did learn that about mattresses.  Yeah, it gains about 30 pounds over its lifetime.  Ugh. 
[00:08:30]  30 fucking pounds.  That, all kinds of other crap.  Let's say hi to Bill in Georgia.  Bill.  Look, hello, Bill.  He liked that part.  He wanted to turn it up.  All right.  You see the bed bug commercials, too, now?  Like, they have a bed bug sniffing dog that comes in and then they freeze them.  And it's like, if you're part of the bed bug epidemic.  It's like, what?  Where the fuck are you living?  Wait, they freeze them?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I saw a show where I bought, because bed bugs are creepy.  No shit.  One of these exterminator shows on Discovery or whatever. 
[00:09:00]  Don't let them bite.  Sleep tight.  They said that bed bugs, they kill them with heat.  Like, what they do is they seal off the room and they make it 140 degrees for three hours  and that kills them.  Does that not warp everything in your room?  I'm sure it does.  What if you have a nice little laminated burea?  Would that hurt everything?  I would think it would.  How do they freeze them?  They take this little wandy thing.  It looks like a power washer kind of a thing.  And they spray.  They get the little dog in there and he...  Snips them out. 
[00:09:30]  And he snips them out.  And then they kind of go over it with that wand thing and put, I guess, liquid nitrogen  or something and just freeze the shit out of everything.  And then the next time you're flat in the bed, it just collapses and crumbles.  Like the Terminator when he was frozen.  So wait, that kills them too?  Is that more of a way...  Now, maybe we have a bug expert.  Is that a way to kill them locally, though, without having to just...  Because the dog will tell you where they are.  I would guess if you have, like, bed bugs and they're in literally your bed, it's probably 
[00:10:00]  best to just freeze that shit and then they vacuum them off while they're frozen.  What the fuck do they look like?  All the eggs and everything.  So they...  That's a bed bug.  Look at how disgusting that thing is.  They look like...  Crawling around.  They look like ticks.  Yeah, they do.  They look like flat ticks.  And after a while, I bet they get engorged.  What can they do?  Who gives a shit?  That's all right.  They crawl in.  Sleep in the bed bugs.  What do they actually do?  Embed themselves in your eyelash right where your eyelashes grow.  That's...  No.  No, I swear they do.  They go in your pee-pee hole.  They go in your pee-pee hole. 
[00:10:30]  Bring one person in that that happened, too.  Do you know, I used to have a...  I think I used to have them badly.  I told you, I thought I had summer beetles or some...  Summer beetles.  Summer beetles.  Just came up with a nice name for what is actually a bed bug.  I had summer beetles.  There were so many of them.  I would see them, like, on the floor by my bed.  I would crawl on top of my comforter, little black ones.  And I think that's what they were.  They were fucking bed bugs.  I didn't know what they were.  Summer beetles.  It's like calling a palmetto bug.  It's a giant fucking cockroach.  Yeah.  Oh, look, it's crawling on this guy's big toe. 
[00:11:00]  How do you get that bug?  Just cut it off.  You can get them anywhere, dude.  You can get them from, like, luggage or you can get them...  I was walking home from school when I was a kid and fighting the mattress on the...  Throwing out.  And I would just use it as a trampoline, me and my buddies.  Not having any regard for what was on it.  Yeah, the mattress outside and someone's garbage out in front.  Just hop on it like you have no idea what was on it.  Yeah, but that was a good find.  That's good.  To drag back to your tree fort or your underground fort.  That was a great find.  Ah, or for rape. 
[00:11:30]  Everyone's punching off.  There's a bed bug registry, Danny.  And apparently New York is a real red area on that map.  Yeah, New York is a very red area by the parking garage that I use here in the city.  Right on the side, as I make the turn, there's a huge, giant billboard that's telling me about how there's bed bugs in New York.  And it's goddamn disgusting.  So I have to look at it every morning.  I get to be reminded of disgusting and filthy in the city.  And it's because this is the melting pot. 
[00:12:00]  This is where people from other lands come in and stay in the hotels.  And they're filthy.  And they have bugs.  Bugs!  Savages, huh?  Savages.  They'll be savages.  That's what I say.  How did we get on bed bugs?  I don't know.  We just kind of meandered.  Oh, because your grandma died.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Grandma was a giant bed bug.  She really was.  She wakes me up years later.  She was a summer beetle.  Yeah.  I said, before you die, and she'd be under my sheets biting my toes. 
[00:12:30]  Saw up with my blood.  I'd wake up in the sweat.  With a rod.  You old hag.  Yeah, you lying old hag.  You bed bug, old hag.  You know what I do to squealers?  I give it to him under the tongue.  A little extra glistering humor.  Poor Grammy.  Listen to this guy.  Brian in Michigan.  Brian.  Brian.  Good morning.  Good morning, Brian.  Hey, we got a cottage on a lake up north there.  We were sitting around the campfire last summer talking about our children and when they were 
[00:13:00]  conceived.  And I'm going to find out my daughter, my brother's son, my sister's two sons, and my little brother's  daughter were all conceived on this mattress that's probably about 100 years old.  You got a 100-year-old mattress in your family?  I don't know how old it is.  It's old.  It's old, though.  And a bunch of people conceived on it.  It's creepy.  And it's like, oh.  But, well, we all alluded to the fact that our children were all conceived on that mattress. 
[00:13:30]  You know what the odd thing is?  Up until I actually got a decent job, which I would call, you know, radio, I don't remember  buying a mattress.  So I had gotten my mattresses.  I don't even know where I got them.  One was like a twin where the middle would just go in about a foot deeper than the rest  of the bed.  And, but I don't remember where I had gotten them, which is kind of creepy, because we 
[00:14:00]  all just used a mattress that was already in the house.  Inherited it.  When you moved out, you kind of took it, I guess.  I moved out of my family's house, what, at 18?  Came back a few times, I guess.  So I had the same mattress for over 20 years.  Yeah, we never got new mattresses in my house.  Damn.  And I think that's bad.  I think that's bad.  Sugar and margarine sandwiches don't really.  It's a conducive atmosphere for new mattresses.  How about you guys a new fucking mattress down on the priority list?  Let's say hi to Jim from Dutchess County. 
[00:14:30]  We did the best we could.  What's up?  What's up, Jim?  All right, Anthony, I'm about to freak out a little bit.  We're at the Borgata about two months ago.  Had bed bugs in the room.  No, you didn't.  I defy you to find a bed bug at the wonderful Borgata.  Freaked out, put the mattress up, put the box spring up all over the room, had security  come in.  Security.  Beating them up.  Six little handcuffs. 
[00:15:00]  Wait, what if security did they arrest?  Did they arrest the alleged innovators?  Yes, yes, they did.  Every hotel, honestly, hotel is where you're going to find them at anywhere because people  come in with their suitcases from Europe or wherever, or even from here, and they have  them.  And it's like, all they can do is get rid of the mattress or treat them.  If that's the case, then if that's, following Anthony's logic, then if that, well, I go  back and I'm freaked out.  I go into the room and I freak out.  I'm like, well, now I've got to check the whole room. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, that was way better than mine.  Why?  Thanks, Jim.  Uh, following your logic with the savages.  Yeah.  Bringing shit in.  Yeah.  You got to imagine they would be bringing more horrific things than the fucking bedbugs  in this country.  I think they are, but bedbugs are like the thing that, uh, you know, they spread easily,  that they're there.  You're laying in a bed.  It's something you can get just from laying in a bed.  You know?  Probably crabs.  I wouldn't doubt they're giving us crabs, too, to tell you the truth, though.  You ever have a bug just crawl through your hair?  Where did it come from?  Growing up, and you don't even know what kind of bug it was? 
[00:16:00]  Yes.  What was it?  An American bug.  Just a good old American bug.  A summer beetle?  A summer beetle.  It was a summer beetle.  I don't know what that is.  Uh, let's say hi to Todd in Jersey.  Todd, what's going on?  Later, Ted.  Hey, guys.  Love you.  Love the show.  Of course you do.  Um, I had a roommate that was dating some skank and got bedbugs.  I moved out.  That is the craziest shit I've ever seen.  Dated a guy with, uh, bedbugs?  Yeah.  No, he dated some chick. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, with bedbugs.  But, yeah, he's waking up in the middle of the night, scratching himself, his skin's all  bleeding.  Yeah.  It's, like, nasty.  Ah, it's disgusting.  You know what?  I'm afraid of these.  I laugh at bedbugs.  When I was living in Buffalo, I was infested with fleas.  You want to...  That's bad.  You want to hell on earth.  Fucking live in a house that's infested with fucking fleas, and you're just too goddamn  poor to take care of the situation.  You do the best you can.  You buy the bombs and everything.  But every day, there would be five or six brand new flea bites on my arms. 
[00:17:00]  I got scars all up and down both arms from fleas in Buffalo to this day.  I went through that with the ex-wife with the four fucking cats.  I laugh at bedbugs.  I laugh at them.  You walk around with white socks.  And you see them popping right up on your white socks.  Yeah, your socks would just look speckled with fleas.  Right.  I tried the...  Horrid.  I tried the best, and when I finally moved back home to Long Island, that's when I got  rid of the flea problem.  Yeah.  Because I pretty much threw everything away.  Yeah, you got my clothes. 
[00:17:30]  You know, you wash them real good.  I think it gets rid of the fleas, I guess.  Yeah, like boiling water.  Yeah, whatever.  Big giant pot.  And that's the only way I got rid of the fucking flea problem.  I never got, you know, whatever.  I never got rid of it on my own.  Yeah, bomb the place, did everything.  I did all that shit.  The ones where it's a spray so you get into the nooks and crannies of your apartment, and sure  enough, within two days, they were just back full force.  You'll never get rid of them doing that, Gregory!  Oh, no.  No, Ted.  No!  Ted.  I have a lasso! 
[00:18:00]  I lasso fleas!  Lasso fleas!  That's how I heard of them!  Yeah!  And you make that noise?  I certainly do!  Freak 40,000 times per household!  Yeah!  That's a lot.  Yes, it is.  Is it a little lasso?  It's a very teeny tiny lasso!  Made of string!  The fan is on it, makes it very difficult, because it blows it all topsy-turvy.  How many fleas can you lasso in a day's work there?  About seven!  Seven!  They're very tricky little buyers!  I've got thousands of them in my apartment!  Yes, I probably would have charged you a lot of money! 
[00:18:30]  How many days would it have taken to get all the fleas out of my apartment?  I'm approximating over four years!  Four years!  Yes, but it's very thorough!  And where would we have to call to get this service?  Ted's Flea Stomping Emporium!  I had our little flea stomping shoes!  They're very pointy tips!  Oh, so you stomped the fleas as well!  I would kick them and karate kick them as well!  That's how I'd get the eggs!  I would hold a flea hostage and demand to take me to the nest! 
[00:19:00]  How well did that work?  Not particularly well!  They're very tough to break under questioning everything!  They don't fall as easily as I'd hope!  They don't rat!  That's nice!  I heard the bug problem is getting worse, whatever.  Alright, let's go to Brian in Jersey.  Brian!  Brian!  Hey, good morning, guys!  Good morning!  Hey, you know, I'm a carpenter and we remodeled...  Alright, thanks a lot, man.  I'm a carpenter and we remodeled the Caesars down in AC. 
[00:19:30]  And, you know, you remodel all the rooms and then you think you're going to get all new  stuff and they bring all these shitty beds back in there with, you know, cum...  You name it, all kinds of shit, you know?  I mean, my partner was saying, you know, you're better off just sleeping on the floor in  those hotels because you think you're sleeping on nice stuff in a nice hotel.  Really?  You know, the old bullshit, you know?  So I figured I'd tell you guys that, you know?  Well, that's just it.  You know, you've got to stay at a hotel and you don't know who's in that bed before you...  Yeah, you sleep right on the floor, you know, you're better off. 
[00:20:00]  I doubt it.  They've got new carpet anyway, you know?  I've blown loads on the floor, on the bed, on the fucking remote, on the couch.  God, it'd still be the worst place to sleep in a hotel.  Is there any place in a hotel over the years you have not shot a load?  The shower, the bathroom, the sinks, the toilet, the fucking...  Like, everywhere.  Everywhere!  My lips got cum on them.  I slipped in the warehouse.  Continued success. 
[00:20:30]  You're sleeping with everybody.  Yeah, you're right, man.  Thank you, Brian.  We've got to go to a bug expert.  He's an exterminator.  Mike in Jersey.  What's up, Mike?  Mike.  Hey, what's up, O&A?  Hey, man.  You've got a lot to worry about, Anthony.  Why?  They're everywhere.  They're everywhere.  It's people like you that get to bring them home.  Don't think you will.  Shut it!  I shower before I leave.  I make sure I'm clean as a whistle. 
[00:21:00]  But the beds aren't that clean.  I know.  I don't care.  I make them dirtier, like I said.  I've been doing pest control 15 years.  This is like the thing that's keeping us in business.  Really?  Bed bugs?  Yeah, but what do they do?  They don't bite you or anything, do they?  Yeah, they don't.  Yeah, they're parasites.  They suck blood.  They suck blood.  Yeah, and the problem is that people don't know they have them because they could be there  for a while.  You don't feel it when it bites.  You think you just got like a rash, right?  Yeah. 
[00:21:30]  It's like mosquitoes, man.  It might get a bit.  You know, the person you're sleeping with may not.  Oh, see, I'm good.  Two hours later, you know, you feel irritation.  We're looking at pictures right now of these red dots on people that have bed bug bites.  I'm pretty good.  I think I'm all right.  That could be an advanced stage of AIDS or bed bug bites.  That's good.  I only...  That's good.  We're looking at a picture that could go either way.  They're only biting my cock then if these pictures are accurate.  Jesus, look at that.  Oh, that guy's got...  Well, you can't look at that.  It's radio. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, but it's red dots and they're very prominent.  It's very rashy.  Got a rash.  It's people that travel, people that go to school.  It's hotels, man.  You bring them home.  There you go.  You got them.  Yeah.  They're a pain in the ass to get rid of.  Do they multiply fast?  Yeah, they do.  Not as fast as a lot of other things, but the thing is they're quiet.  They're, you know, they're stealthy, man.  You can have them for a long time, not know it.  And usually before people realize they have them, it's been there for a while. 
[00:22:30]  Wow.  You know, before they actually see the bugs.  They don't know what it is.  Oh.  It's pretty crazy.  Well, everything you want to know about bed bugs right here on the program.  Well, thank you, Mikey.  This guy's name's ought to be Bed Bug with two Gs at the end.  Apparently that's this guy's name.  Oh, very good news.  On our hotline, he wants to talk about bed bugs.  Edward Norton.  Really?  Ryan in Boston, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I had bed bugs when I was in the Navy, and they're way worse than fleas. 
[00:23:00]  I've had both, actually, because I got a dog.  And fleas take about a month to get rid of, and as long as you vacuum every day and get,  like, the open surfaces, the fleas are gone.  Bed bugs hide, and they lay eggs that can last up to six months.  So all of a sudden, you've had them gone for months.  You could move.  I moved into another house, and all of a sudden, I had bed bugs infested in the room,  and you don't know, like you said, until they're everywhere.  Wow.  Well, you know something?  I don't have any of these big welts on me, so I feel a little lucky.  You don't have to have the welts, man. 
[00:23:30]  Got it.  Don't the fleas, uh...  That's only if you're allergic to them that you get the welts.  Well, then who gives a shit?  I never got the welts.  That's why I didn't know I had them.  Dude, flea bites are fucking vicious, though.  Don't you think?  Uh, they are pretty vicious, but they're so easy to get rid of, though, compared to bed bugs.  Yeah, but...  Bed bugs, all of a sudden, you wake up, and you have bugs all over you that you can actually  see out of nowhere.  Ah, but fleas are all over you, and that shit makes you itch.  That shit makes you itch.  These, you are just covered, right?  You wake up from a dead sleep, and you haven't had them, and all of a sudden, they're just dead. 
[00:24:00]  All the eggs hatch at once.  You got them fucking crawling everywhere, like ticks all over your bones.  That's making them sound really crazy.  I don't have them.  It is disgusting.  What about chiggers?  Do you ever have any chiggers?  Oh, shit, I hate the chiggers.  What is a chigger?  A chigger is another type of insect, but that really gets on the plants more than people.  I hate it.  Yeah.  Oh.  What works better to get rid of bed bugs, heat or freezing? 
[00:24:30]  I would say freezing.  Yeah, I would say freezing.  If they're advertising the freezing thing, and the little doggie that sniffs them, it's  got to be freezing.  That's the good stuff.  But I've seen the heat with the dog sniffing, too.  Yeah.  Is it a beagle that sniffs them?  Yes, it's a beagle.  It's adorable.  They're very cute.  Yes.  Let's go to William in South Carolina, who's a cop.  Don't fool me.  Hello, Bill.  Hello, guys.  What's up, William?  About 15 years ago, I answered a death investigation.  An old woman had been dead for about a week in the summer. 
[00:25:00]  When we pulled her off her mattress, her mattress had a bunch of lumps in it.  It didn't look right.  We cut it open.  She had about $150,000 cash in her mattress.  Oh, cash.  Yeah.  She had been there for a while, so she was stinky.  She pissed all over the mattress.  We had to process all the money.  Oh, I'm sure you did.  Why the fuck process the money?  Put it in your back pocket and get out of there.  He processed $100,000 and some odd thousand. 
[00:25:30]  I would never be able to be a cop.  I would take that money in a second.  Of course.  Old lady pissy money.  The family was real upset that she had died, but they tuned up real quick when they found  out she had money.  You know what?  If you're a good guy, you tell the family, you're not going to believe this.  I just found $100,000 in her mattress.  Yeah.  You make them real happy, and you walk away with $50,000.  Exactly.  What's wrong with you?  You're a real cop.  I'm sure you did.  What's up with this honesty thing?  Come on.  Probably dead. 
[00:26:00]  William.  We lose you?  Oh, shit.  He didn't want to know the investigation.  Well, that's...  Why are we talking about that?  Oh, we get onto something.  Oh, Jimmy's grandma.  Oh, Jimmy's poor dead grandma.  Grandma.  Grandma.  God rest her soul.  Yes.  May God disturb it.  Keep poking it.  Yeah.  Every time she begins her eternal sleep.  Send bedbugs to her clouds.  Yes.  Summer beetles.  Was she a bed eater?  I don't remember, to be honest with you.  More men die of the heart attack than the females. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, but...  Still the number one cause with females, I think.  Is it?  Really?  Yeah.  And males.  Why does...  You don't hear about females dropping, though, as much.  They're the carriers.  Oh, good gravy.  Well, that's fun.  Radio news.  Air America.  Radio.  Air America is done.  Done-ski, huh?  Is that the second or third time it's been done?  I know.  What the fuck?  I thought it was bankrupt years ago.  People are not interested in that shit.  Files for bankruptcy and immediately ends broadcasting. 
[00:27:00]  Immediately.  Nobody wants it.  It's going to be like reruns today, and by Monday, it is completely like it never happened.  Danny tried to find it, and he got that Mel Gibson fucking...  I saw it on purpose.  I just said it to Travis to be an asshole.  That's funny.  Air America movie.  So there goes Air America.  That's it.  No one wants to hear from the left, I guess, as far as radio entertainment goes, because  it's so compelling.  And then what they try to do is this fairness in media doctrine bullshit, which means that  each ideology gets the exact same amount of hours on a show. 
[00:27:30]  It's amazing to me that anybody, of course, the Democrats and liberals, would think that's  appropriate.  That you would have to, like, take a guy who's getting ratings off the air.  Yeah.  Let the market decide, and let people...  Of course!  If the ratings are high, then let them talk all they want.  For some reason, people do not feel compelled to listen to left-leaning radio.  Right-wing radio, for some reason, whether you like it or not, whether you listen to it 
[00:28:00]  and just hate it or love it, people tune into it.  Yep.  They really are compelled.  I think there's too many factions of the left.  Like the right, you could listen to Rush Limbaugh and sit there and go, no, I obviously consider  myself more right-leaning than left.  I am more of a libertarian than people do give me credit for, but I do lean further  right, that's for sure.  So I'll listen to shows like Hannity and everything and enjoy it, but I'll listen with an open 
[00:28:30]  mind and go, yeah, some of that's bullshit, this is okay, I don't know where that came  from, but the left has so many factions of the left that they can't listen to one host  and go, yes, I could really latch on to what this guy understands and believes in.  I also find them irritating because people always wonder, why do you bag on liberals when  a lot of my social policies are very liberal?  It's things like when Sean Penn or any of these other artists won't talk to Fox News, it's  like, you fucking cornball. 
[00:29:00]  Is that your, wow, you're really rebellious.  You refuse to talk to the news organization while you're plugging a, I don't like CNN's  prominent ideology.  I would talk to them, I would talk to any network.  Jump on.  Babies.  Give them your point of view.  Yeah.  That's it.  Well, if they have something to say and they swat it at you, swat something back at them.  Don't be such a jizz bucket.  Jizz bucket.  I just hate that fucking, I'm not going to talk to you if I don't like what you have  to say.  It's childish.  Well, it's done. 
[00:29:30]  It's it.  Off the air.  It's done.  Does Mars have control of the online feed?  Yes, but he does it with his feet.  Our online feed has been all fucked up the last two days.  Are you kidding?  And our channel's supposedly the only one, according to a bunch of listeners.  It's all right.  That online thing, a fad.  Yeah, I think so.  It's a fad like the hula hoop.  I think you're right.  Yeah.  Let's go to Mr. Motherfucker.  Mr. Motherfucker.  What?  Oh, hey guys.  Yeah, what I noticed with Air America, though, is that anyone that's talented that can do radio 
[00:30:00]  on the left never goes to Air America or they leave Air America immediately, like Rachel  Maddow left to do MSNBC.  Ed Schultz, you know, he does his show on regular radio.  And Al Franken went to become a douchebag.  Went to.  He always was.  Yeah, I know.  But I mean, now he's a douchebag in, uh, where is he, Minnesota, where they elect fantastic  people to office.  I think Mr. Motherfucker's making a pretty good point, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A lot of the, a lot of the talent, they just don't want to be associated with Air America. 
[00:30:30]  Well, they didn't even like Mr. Motherfucker.  Uh, how could he be wrong?  Well, thank you, Mr. Motherfucker.  You know, it kind of, I like Minnesota because they elect weird, like Ventura and Franken.  I do, though.  I like the fact that they really are a weird place.  They're dummies.  They are, but they really have had enough of the fucking regular politicians.  You got to say that for them.  Even if they're ultra left, they have had enough of regular politicians.  Al Franken could not be more left. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, no.  Could not be more left.  I still like him, though.  And he, I.  Do you really like Al Franken?  I hate him.  I hate him.  I think he's funny.  I don't think he's funny.  Funny how?  I think he's sarcastic in a nasty fucking way.  Always made me laugh.  Don't like him.  His writing or him?  His stand-up, I've always, uh.  I've always liked him, and he's always nice to me, so if someone's nice to me, I'm more  able to like him.  I don't know if I've ever seen his stand-up.  Yeah.  I have a tape from many, many years ago from him and Stuart bringing me on stage at Caroline's,  and I was a nobody back then, and he was just nice to me.  Well, that's why.  But yeah, I'm saying, if someone's nice to you, Larry, what's the kind of, uh. 
[00:31:30]  The Seinfeld guy, Larry.  Larry David.  Larry David.  He said one time, it's something about, it's hard for me not to find something in a guy I like  if they pay me a compliment.  Oh, really?  Or something to that effect.  I'm like, yeah, that's human nature.  If someone's nice to you, it's hard to not like him.  That's why you love Leno, and that's why you're sticking up for Leno.  Only because he was nice to me.  Only because he was nice to me.  But then again, Letterman was nice to me, too.  That's the only reason you're on his cut.  Quite frankly, listen to an Edward Norton phoner, then listen to Al Franken's stand-up.  You don't like Edward Norton's phoner?  I didn't say that.  I just said I'd rather listen to him.  A little slow, but. 
[00:32:00]  You're so polite.  No, because he likes Jimmy.  We've got to call like it is, man.  That was rough.  Because he likes Jimmy.  We will never take a phone call from him again.  I just keep thinking about that.  Or actually, we have to.  We have to take Edward Norton's phone calls now.  Of course we will, every single time.  I like him a lot.  We're one of the only radio shows he does.  I want to hear him on our airwaves.  I want to have him come in.  That would be good.  We've been trying to get that done for weeks, months, years.  Yes, whatever.  Yay.  Yay.  Why don't we take our first break? 
[00:32:30]  Ooh.  We have a little of the Tonight Show Wars.  Oh, still going on?  Well, Dave and Jay now, I mean.  Gloves off, huh?  Gloves off.  It's all about those two now.  Because I guess Conan's last show is today.  Yep.  So he's out of the picture for real, you know.  And now it's all about Jay and Dave just fucking taking.  Duking it out.  Taking shots.  Boy, and this battle goes back a ways.  Still some bad blood in this battle of the late night talk shows, if you remember, a movie was made. 
[00:33:00]  How weird is that, to have a battle going on for many, many, many years?  It was 17 years ago, is it?  That fucking battle?  Fuck yeah, man.  The big battle where the movie was made.  What's ours up to?  10 or 11?  Could be longer than that, to tell you the truth.  Ours?  Yeah.  With, with.  Yeah, yeah.  I think that goes like, since, probably the mid-90s.  Probably 15 years.  I tweeted what I had to say about that fucking thing.  Fucking asshole. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, I didn't hear it.  Trying to have power over us.  Shut up.  Use everything as a bargaining chip.  They sat me down and said, best of luck.  Do you want us to fire those two?  Shut up.  Best of luck.  Godspeed.  I was looking for the Leno Letterman stuff.  It's in the paper today.  Some brutal shots.  Yeah, there's.  Do you have it in front of you?  I do, yeah.  TV Friday.  TV Friday.  In the post.  Is that Richard Huff's column?  No, no, this is Huff's Daily News.  This is Michael Starr and Michael Shane about this. 
[00:34:00]  And they're just taking shots at each other.  And they both have really good writing staffs.  I mean, I know.  I know Leno's writers are great.  And I know some of Letterman's writers are fucking great writers.  It's going to be fun to watch everybody attacking each other.  Letterman's all in.  He ain't going to let this go anytime soon.  Well, I don't.  He's all in now.  People think that the public will eventually get sick of it.  And they will.  Once they're head to head, it'll be interesting for a couple weeks.  Then no one will give a shit anymore.  People don't fucking care.  I'm worried about Jay.  Really?  Oh, I'm not.  You think he's going to be right back where he was?  Oh, as far as rating? 
[00:34:30]  I'm sure people will tune in to both to watch them attack each other.  No, I'm not.  No.  You think he's going to be right where he was, though?  I don't know.  I think it might take a little while.  He's thinking a beating in the last six, seven months.  But I think when you see him back in that familiar territory where he's doing that monologue,  having the guests, he's got the set, he's got that.  I think people are going to go right in like he was never gone.  All right.  Yeah, we'll see.  He's doing the White House Correspondents Dinner.  He got invited to do that.  That's a huge gig.  Oh, did he?  Yeah.  And he's going on Oprah next week.  Yeah.  Him and Oprah are very good friends. 
[00:35:00]  Uh-oh.  And now he's going to sit down to get that nice guy image back.  I think Leno will be fine.  That was stolen from him.  I think he'll be fine.  What are the big shots in the paper right now?  Um, well, the ones that we, the one we did last, uh, Letterman said, uh, last night  on the Jay Leno, last night on the Jay Leno 10 p.m. NBC Variety Show, Jay Leno said that  this NBC Tonight Show mess is not his fault.  And I said, I know, I know it's not his fault, but isn't it funny that he always turns up  at the scene of the crime? 
[00:35:30]  And, uh, Leno said, boy, remember the more innocent days of late night TV when the only  thing people cared about was what intern, what intern the host was nailing?  What happened to those days?  Oh, shit.  These are big shots.  Now they're just brutal.  Yeah, they're brutalizing.  These are overhand rights.  Leno, this is the one we played last week.  Leno, Letterman's been hammering me all every night.  You know the best way to get Letterman to ignore you?  Marry him.  And then Letterman said, five years ago when NBC said to Jay, you know that Conan's going  to take over your job in five years, that's when you say, okay, fine, no hard feelings. 
[00:36:00]  You call ABC, you call Fox, you try to get my job, you leave, you don't go, okay, I'll  be in the lobby if you need me.  Oh, shit.  That's great.  Watching just two grown men with great gigs pounding each other, it's hysterical.  Do you understand, though, how much I like this?  Because in the end, Leno and Letterman are stand-ups, and you're watching two stand-ups,  and again, in the best way they can in that forum, they can't do it like a club, slug 
[00:36:30]  it out.  We've heard right here in our forum, stand-ups sit here and beat the shit out of each other  and still have respect or whatever you comics call it, I doubt it's called respect, but  still friendly, whatever, but they beat the shit out of each other, and it's good to see  them actually doing that, what do stand-ups do?  Well, people are expecting it from Letterman, because he's always been kind of cranky, and  people know Dave does that.  A lot of, I mean, people who know comedy understand that Jay's a comic, he's not, people think 
[00:37:00]  he's this fucking mom-and-pop guy who was raised on a farm by Christ and Mary.  Yeah.  He was, he's a stand-up, he was a national headliner, so what do you think, he's not  going to fucking smash Dave back?  I mean, just like, you know, but people kind of expect it more from Letterman, because  he's got that crankier, he'll shit on you quickly image.  It really is great to see him going for that big fucking hit on shit that they're both  sensitive about.  Adam in Texas, this is like Coke versus Pepsi, this letter, let him think. 
[00:37:30]  And then someone from Minnesota wants to stick up for the state, Trucker D, what's up, Trucker  D?  Morning, boy.  Hello.  Hi, sir.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Trucker D.  You know, we didn't really elect that douchebag, he, you know, bought the election, sold the  election, Coleman tried to sue him, but you know how that goes.  Oh, Al Franken, yeah, that was one of those things where if it was the other way around,  they would have really been going crazy.  It took forever for them to figure out and count votes and absentee ballots, but Franken 
[00:38:00]  got in and whatever, we'll see how he does.  So far, not too impressed.  Yeah, I'm not impressed, and you know, I've been to, I would find a lot of laughter.  All right, sir, let me go to Scott in Cincinnati.  Scott.  Yeah.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, Matt.  Pretty good.  Two of the most popular people on TV are on the left, Stewart and Colbert.  Yeah.  It seems like making fun of the right is a lot more popular and trying to get serious about 
[00:38:30]  it.  Well, that's a good point.  That's what it is.  John Stewart, I find him funny, but he does get very preachy, even in his comedy.  You could see through it and go like, all right, he's trying to make a political point.  Colbert, on the other hand, is doing a hysterical parody of those right-wing Fox-type shows, and  it's done so perfectly and so on the mark that you can't help but laugh and see that he's 
[00:39:00]  completely on the left.  When he's taking this side of the right, he's goofing on it so much, and it's so obvious,  but it's funny as fuck, so I think it's great.  The point is, these lefties do have an audience of people who are watching or listening to them.  The problem is, they just can't figure it out as a whole network, like does Air America  try to do?  And you need somebody as talented as, like, even Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert to be able  to put that message across.  It sounds like Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert would never do Air America.  Were they ever guests on Air America? 
[00:39:30]  I don't know.  No.  And, O.B., I'd like to apologize for calling you a fucking asshole a few years ago.  Oh, I don't care.  Oh, was it out live or was it on the air?  You were trashing the girl from the Oscars that you didn't have any material a few years  ago.  Oh, we were just talking about you.  Wait, wait.  Now you've piqued my curiosity.  Who were we trashing?  It was the girl that was called in and did a phone her for the Oscars, and she didn't 
[00:40:00]  have any material.  All she did was go to the party or something, and you really got honor about it.  And you called mean asshole over that?  Yeah, well, it was, you had to have been there, man.  He was.  He was.  He's open.  He was there.  Dude, we destroyed that girl because she called up.  She was supposed to be our exclusive Oscar cover.  She had absolutely nothing, so we almost made her cry.  Yeah, exactly.  She was so bummed out and depressed.  Oh, okay.  No, I take pride in what I did that day, my friend. 
[00:40:30]  But thank you for the apology, I guess.  All right, Scott.  No problem.  Have a good one, man.  Scott in Cincinnati.  We'll go to break with Conan and what he had to say about this whole thing.  But now he completely, you know, now he fades out.  I think he got like $45, $46 million.  Some of that money going toward his staff.  Yeah, sure.  I feel sorry for him.  He'll be in the poor house.  Here's Conan from last night.  The internet, you know, they pick up things, they run with it, and the general terms of  the contract are now all over the internet. 
[00:41:00]  But there are some provisions in the contract you may not know about.  And I want to tell you about them right now.  I am prohibited from coming within 500 yards of 1130.  I must return the Etch-A-Sketch my contract was written on.  I'm not allowed to make fun of NBC programming.  I have to let the programming speak for itself.  The cop who escorts me off the lot after my last show must have the rank of lieutenant or higher.  Max Weinberg must write his key to the women's locker room at the NBC gym.  I have to watch at least one NBC show every weeknight in order to double ratings. 
[00:41:30]  Effective today, NBC will stop paying for Andy Richter's medical marijuana and medical Jack Daniels.  I must stop production on my documentary expose of NBC, Inside the Cock, which...  Oh, I know why.  Travis is going to trick me up today.  Or trip me up.  STP's new album is done and will be released in May. 
[00:42:00]  That's why the STP as we come back to the show.  In other music news, Steve Perry.  The big 6-1 today.  Yes!  Steve Perry is 61 years old.  Holy shit.  Isn't that amazing?  And with that, Aerosmith says they're holding auditions for a new singer.  That band is a mess.  That band is a mess.  Movies! 
[00:42:30]  Actually, another fucking music note.  Peter Gabriel, remember him?  Yeah.  Red Rain?  Red Rain.  Never liked any of his stuff.  Never liked his solo stuff.  Well, maybe that one.  Salisbury Hill?  Big time.  Yeah.  Really?  Well, maybe.  That was kind of catchy.  What about Beakle?  No.  Any Beakle fans?  I don't think you're going to find many. 
[00:43:00]  His was too fucking...  Travis, give me a little Beakle.  I think it's called Beakle.  As this starts up, no one's going to like this.  I was just joking.  Peter Gabriel says he's going to not reunite with Genesis at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  induction.  No.  Of course, he started with the Genesis thing before Phil Collins stepped to the microphone.  What is this driveling?  You've never heard this before?  Seven minutes is too fucking...  How long is it?  Seven minutes.  Yeah.  Thank you.  That's another Peter Gabriel staple. 
[00:43:30]  This is an epic.  An epic song for Peter Gabriel.  Enjoy it.  Epic.  This is one of his quick ones.  The guy didn't know how to edit his goddamn music.  Right?  Is this...  It stinks.  Wait.  I can feel it coming in the air tonight.  Oh, Lord.  What a ripoff.  Yeah.  Say with that...  Oh, he did this first, right? 
[00:44:00]  Oh, shit.  Sorry.  Yeah.  Did he?  As usual.  Who gives a shit?  How the fuck do I still know the words this time?  Oh, my God.  You probably heard it a thousand times.  Nah, this is not a radio hit.  Now, is this a deep cut?  Bico!  Oh, Bico!  What's Bico?  I don't fucking know.  I guess some leader that did wrong or did right or...  I don't fucking know the story.  Listen to the words. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, we don't have to go through this.  Man.  Ah, the Tooth Fairy.  The Dwayne Johnson vehicle for Disney.  Yeah.  He used to be known as The Rock, but fucking...  I guess Vince McMahon wanted his name back.  So now he goes as Dwayne Johnson.  Dwayne Johnson is playing a fairy.  Well, the fucking trailer's been out there for months.  The commercials have been out there for months.  I thought this movie was already out there and gone, but it finally opens today.  Finally.  Wow.  Think about that.  We've been seeing that dumb Billy Crystal, what's that? 
[00:45:00]  And he's got his little wings.  Yeah.  Well, Tooth Fairy is out today.  Ten percent on Rotten Tomatoes.  Ten percent.  Ten percent.  Ten percent.  Wow.  Ten percent.  Steve Biko.  That ain't good.  Who is Steve Biko?  Biko?  Oh, no.  And this is why Peter Gabriel had to fucking sing about him.  Something bad happened in 1977 with this guy, right?  He was an apartheid activist in South Africa in the 60s and 70s. 
[00:45:30]  A student leader.  Later founded the Black Consciousness Movement.  Oh, I thought he founded Black Rock Coalition.  Oh, no.  That's B-Girl.  And what happened to him?  Did he die?  He's dead.  It's never good when they have one date and then another date.  He died in police custody and became some kind of martyr.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Maybe he should have done what he was told.  Eat.  Oh, he starved himself? 
[00:46:00]  He went on a hunger strike.  He did die in police custody and he suffered a major head injury while in police custody  and was chained to a window grill for a day on September 11th, 1977.  Coincidence?  Police loaded him in the back of a Land Rover, naked, and began the 1,500-kilometer drive  to Pretoria to take him to a prison with hospital facilities.  However, he was nearly dead due to the previous injuries. 
[00:46:30]  He died shortly after, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Well, and I guess that's what they were writing about.  All right.  We've been back on the air for five minutes.  Yeah.  There was something said that is completely false.  Does anyone want to try to figure it out?  Oh, really?  Travis can't play.  Travis does?  No one in that room can play.  Okay.  STP's new album.  Did I say it?  I said it.  Oh. 
[00:47:00]  You were checking shit.  STP, I said, album is done and will be released in May.  That was correct.  Okay.  Oh, that's correct.  Something was said or done that is so false, I can't even tell you.  Wow.  I am getting major douche chill.  You threw out a false information?  I threw out something and it went over everyone's head.  And most of instant feedback, only one guy picked up on it.  And I would give you credit, but it just has phone numbers and stuff.  The fact that you implied Peter Gabriel stole from Phil Collins? 
[00:47:30]  Well, no, that was correct.  That was me.  And it was sort of corrected and it just sounded a little like in the air tonight.  Yeah, a little bit.  Just having fun there, though.  Anyone?  Anyone?  It's a biggie.  Who said it?  Blatantly wrong.  Opie said he said it.  I said it.  I was just giving some facts.  Oh, when you make Joe Perry, they said they're looking for a new singer.  Steve Perry is 61.  Steve Perry is 61.  Is he?  Mm-hmm. 
[00:48:00]  All right.  He is 61.  Okay.  You mentioned him in Aerosmith when he was in Journey.  Thank you.  Aerosmith.  And I said, speaking of Steve Perry, Aerosmith is holding auditions for a new singer.  Oh, thinking Joe Perry.  No, actually, I was thinking Steven Tyler.  Steven Tyler?  But Steve Perry, I guess, because Steven Tyler, Joe Perry.  Yeah.  Hey, man.  It always is confusing, though.  I fucked up.  It's Steve Perry from Journey.  Wow.  He's 61. 
[00:48:30]  But I said Steve Perry thinking I was talking about Steven Tyler.  Steven Tyler, Joe Perry.  It all gets very confusing with those guys.  Hey, it went over, you know.  You want to hear it?  Yeah, sure.  Okay.  All right.  Let's listen.  In other music news, Steve Perry.  The big 6'1 today.  Yes.  Steve Perry is 61 years old.  Holy shit.  Isn't that amazing?  And with that, Aerosmith says they're holding auditions for a new singer.  Very good. 
[00:49:00]  Fucking smooth, though, bro.  Yeah, very smooth.  I got that one past everybody.  Very smooth.  Fucking smooth, man.  We could continue with the music thing, though, because Prince.  Remember this Prince guy.  Prince.  A couple hits back in the 80s.  Turns out this Prince guy is a Vikings fan, I guess.  Let's not forget about the big football games.  He's from Minnesota.  He's another nut that's living up in Minnesota.  Are we looking at two huge upsets this weekend with a Vikings-Jets Super Bowl?  Are we looking at that? 
[00:49:30]  Perhaps so.  That would be two huge upsets this weekend.  Was there a big party in Times Square last night for the Jets?  A little bit.  A little rally.  A little rally.  A little rally.  How'd that go?  Yeah.  How'd that go?  A lot of people show up?  I don't know.  I think Eastside Dave went down there.  I guess we'll listen to Ron and Fez.  He went down there with a Giants hat on.  Yeah, yeah.  So Ron and Fez will have an update on what happened.  That boy has nothing good to say about the Jets.  Who?  My God.  Eastside Dave.  Eastside Dave.  He hates the Jets. 
[00:50:00]  Because he's a Giants fan?  Yeah.  And he says that the Jets are a Long Island team, whereas the Giants are the real New York  team.  I have no problem with that statement.  I like to think that the Jets are still a Long Island team.  Being from Long Island.  But that's the minority.  I think a lot of New Yorkers want to embrace the Jets now.  And of course.  I don't find a lot of Jets fans when I'm walking around Manhattan.  It's a lot of Giants fans.  Well, that's true.  I think a lot of Jets fans come from Jersey.  Definitely Long Island.  Manhattan, not so much. 
[00:50:30]  You're from the Eastside Dave School of Thought on this one.  It's sort of true.  Yeah.  Kind of the same thing with the Yankees.  You don't see...  You see...  I mean, with the Mets.  Sorry.  You don't see a lot of Mets fans walking around Manhattan.  You just don't.  Islander fans, you never see fucking New York Islander fans walking around Manhattan.  Well, that was my shock.  And Jersey, you get a lot of Yankee fans even from Jersey.  But Mets fans?  No.  Never.  Never.  So he's sort of right.  And Jersey's just as trashy as Long Islander.  And honestly, I've seen a lot of people wearing Jets stuff in Manhattan. 
[00:51:00]  I'm like, where the fuck...  I don't wear a lot of sports logos in general.  Yeah.  And I haven't worn a Jets thing all year.  But these people all of a sudden are wearing Jets hats.  And you can tell they're like fucking brand spanking new.  Crispy.  Like fluorescent green almost.  Right.  They're so new.  They're getting excited.  Yeah, but I'm sure some of these real football fans in this town will straighten them out.  Where were you?  Doing other shit.  Fucking my wife and working. 
[00:51:30]  That's so true.  They can't fucking...  Fair weather fans.  Dude, I was there.  We just take the grease out.  Well, aren't you a dickhead?  You're the asshole.  I was busy.  The best.  Where were you when they were 2-14?  Watching a team that was winning.  Stupid asshole.  Why should I be depressed around the Super Bowl every year?  Do you understand?  For Jet fans, Super Bowl Sunday has been a cuckold experience since the early 70s. 
[00:52:00]  Yes.  Or late 60s.  Remember the fucking last time they were?  Late 60s.  Look, I'm a hardcore hockey fan.  I love the Islanders.  But, you know, when they're a shitty team year after year, guess what?  You don't follow them as much, and you don't go to the games as much.  My favorite teams are the Cowboys and the Jets.  Always has been.  What do you think?  Two big upsets this weekend?  How cool would it be?  Brett Favre and then the Jets.  Wow.  That would be a nice little payback. 
[00:52:30]  Shove his dick into the fucking dirt.  Wow.  Super Bowl Sunday.  Was that a prediction?  I would love to see the...  Holy shit.  No, because then they're going to say sports curse.  That's over.  That's two huge, ridiculous upsets that have to happen.  That would just be nice.  The Saints and the Colts.  Do you think both teams could lose this weekend?  For real?  They can.  I mean, come on.  The Saints are ridiculous.  Look at that.  And playing at home.  You know, last year, the pass loss.  True.  So it could happen.  Well, I know the Jets will beat the Colts, so now I've got to just wait to see if the 
[00:53:00]  Vikings can get the...  You're like Joe Namath.  Dude, the Jets...  Saying the Jets are going to win?  The Jets will beat the Colts this weekend.  Wow.  This Rex Ryan is insane.  You got a score?  No, I don't have a score.  Give me some numbers.  If it gets ugly, Rex Ryan's going to run on the field and just take a bite out of Peyton  Manning.  Hopefully his bicep, so he can't throw as well.  I'd like some numbers out of you, though.  I'd like a score.  A score?  Yeah.  Give us a score so we can...  The only way the Jets beat the Colts, it's got to be a low-scoring game.  You think low-scoring game?  Which, you know, I mean, the Colts' offense is ridiculous, but the fucking Jets have a 
[00:53:30]  nice defense.  Yeah.  You know, if they allow them to start scoring points, it's over, Johnny.  Yeah.  And it'll be a blowout.  But if the Jets can fucking keep that D going, it'll be a low-scoring win for the Jets.  I'm going to say 8-16.  8-16?  16 to 8.  There's no rhythm to that.  Just some weird plays going on.  I'll go.  I'll go.  Man, they've got to hold them to, like, 10 points. 
[00:54:00]  Really?  So we're two touchdowns tops.  So take the under, you're saying?  Well, what is the over?  I don't know.  What is it?  What is the over-under, sports fans?  Help her out here.  Well, but it's a weird game to bet, as far as that goes.  Because it'll either be a fucking just blowout.  Blowout one way, but the Colts just, you know, dominating.  It's 39.  39 is the over-under.  39 is the over-under?  Take the under, for fuck's sake. 
[00:54:30]  39 points isn't a lot of points when you start doing some numbers.  I'm saying take the under.  That's not a lot of points.  D, D, D, D.  I take the over.  23-17 is the over.  Anything more than that is an over.  Yeah.  I'm taking the under.  23-17 is not a high-scoring game.  No, I don't think it will be.  Wow, what do you do?  I'm taking the under right now.  3-0, I say, Jets.  3-0.  2-0.  Safety.  What are the bettors doing? 
[00:55:00]  Are they fucking going for the over?  Hmm.  On 39 points?  Yeah, what's the big line?  What's the over-under on the Saints?  53.  See what I'm saying?  Well, apparently they're expecting a lower-scoring game, I guess.  The Saints have averaged like 40 points a game this year.  Yeah, Drew Brees has had just a ridiculous year.  Fuck.  So why don't you take the over on that game and just make money?  Over on what?  The Saints game?  Yeah.  50-what? 
[00:55:30]  53.  53.  I would take the over.  I'm taking the over.  You would take the over.  I would take the over.  I'm taking the under on the Jets game.  I'm taking the over on the Saints.  Write all this down, Travis.  Come on.  Come on.  For Monday.  Come on.  You're taking the over on the Saints?  Let's go.  Over on the Saints game, under on the Jets game right now.  53.  Give it to me.  Get me a bookie.  You're wrong on both counts.  Saints is going to be a disappointingly low-scoring game.  I would go under on the Saints game for real.  Yep.  Everyone's expecting over. 
[00:56:00]  For fucking real.  No.  I say that the final score of the Saints game is going to be 27-17 or 7-44.  And I don't think the Saints will run up the score if they got in the bag.  My prediction's in.  That's the problem, too.  You're going over Saints, under on the Jets.  Yeah, you know what?  That's it.  I'm decided.  I've got to be honest.  Mike from Baltimore nailed what I think the Jets game is going to be, too.  Yeah?  I'm thinking like 17-13, somewhere around there.  Very good, Mike.  Me and you are on the same page today. 
[00:56:30]  Well, that's what the Jets have to do to win this game.  Oh, I said something completely wrong.  If they win, they win a low-scoring game.  Maybe two years ago.  Sorry.  Shut up.  What do you want in the Super Bowl?  The Jets.  And the Vikings?  And the Vikings.  I think a lot of New Yorkers want Jets-Vikings, obviously.  Yeah, that'd be nice.  Obviously.  No one wants to fuck with the Saints.  Ugh.  I'm finally getting back for that Katrina thing.  Yeah, I know, man.  Anyway, speaking of the Super Bowl, Prince has a... 
[00:57:00]  Big game, Opie.  Call it the big game so we don't get in trouble.  The Super Bowl.  The big fucking Super Bowl.  Exactly.  All right, that's what we'll call it this year.  We're not saying the Super Bowl.  We're saying the big fucking Super Bowl.  No, I just want to say Super Bowl and Opie and Anthony are the official show of the Super Bowl.  You got that right.  Go ahead.  Cease and desist.  It's already been heard.  It's like objecting to something in court.  Yeah, we said it first.  Yeah.  How could you tell us we're not?  We already said it.  That's right.  Are we the official radio show of the Super Bowl?  Oh, exactly.  Oh, yeah.  Yay! 
[00:57:30]  We certainly are.  I didn't know that.  Yay!  What was it?  Yay for me?  Hooray for me to hell with you, huh?  Yes, exactly.  That's what I say now.  We ought to drive down there so we can be speedy skippies.  Speedy skippies.  Uh, what?  People that know the Jets more than me, like Charlie here in Staten Island has something.  Charlie.  Yeah, in the regular season, the Jets held the Saints.  I think they only scored one offensive touchdown.  The other touchdown they scored on a kick return or a fumble or something like that. 
[00:58:00]  So they can hold that team.  They have the defense to do that.  And I'd rather see them play them than play far.  You're basing it on one game.  Are you basing that whole decision on who you should pay?  That's why football is so fucking weird.  In baseball, you could have a fucking team wipe another team's ass one day.  Like fucking 19-0.  And then, uh, the next day they're playing and the other team beats them.  Congratulations to Anthony with the worst improv football score in the history of improv football scores. 
[00:58:30]  That was baseball.  Oh, okay.  I was saying baseball, you could win 19-0.  Oh, did you say baseball?  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  And then the next day, the other team can win.  So it's like, well, they beat them.  They beat them 19-0.  It's like football, you get one shot at them.  I got it.  Sorry, I didn't think 19-0 would have been an awful football score.  Oh, my God, it would have been.  That would be like something like a girlfriend would go.  But the score could be 11-2.  That's what I have in the pool.  I hope I win.  Mike in Boston just said something completely wrong. 
[00:59:00]  The Pats didn't lose the playoffs last year.  We didn't even make it.  Oh, no, I know.  But it was like, it was one of those things that was...  It seems like last year that the Pats lost the Super Bowl after that incredible season.  But, no, that's actually two years ago.  Two years ago.  Hey, Joe in Long Island, I curse you, Joe, but go ahead.  I have a prediction for the game Sunday.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Monday, a bunch of Haitian kids running around with Jets AFC Championship shirts.  Oh, Jesus.  I curse you.  I curse you, Joe.  Oh, the Haitian children will be getting... 
[00:59:30]  I give you a Haitian curse, Joe.  The losing team championship shirts.  Why do we want to wear this one?  They'll not even go to the big game.  Caribbean gym.  We tried to say Super Bowl, but they will sue us.  Yep, they'll be walking around with those things.  Well...  Whoever the team is.  This leads us to this fine song that Prince came up with.  He's got a Vikings fight song. 
[01:00:00]  What?  No, he doesn't.  Prince is lowering himself to the point of making a football song.  When did he have a hit?  When was the last time he had a hit?  He wrote Manic Monday for the Bengals.  Did he?  Of course he did.  Sunday's his fundy.  Exactly.  That's what I mean.  Come on.  That's genius.  Let's go make some noise.  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  I hated that one.  He said in his best bedroom voice,  Come on, honey.  Let's go make some noise. 
[01:00:30]  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  Let's go make some noise.  Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Prince wrote this.  You can tell.  It's almost...  He gave up on the lyrics on this song, though.  This morning for me.  It kind of falls apart.  Why was he kissing Valentino?  Yeah, why would Prince...  Exactly.  The original lyrics were probably was, 
[01:01:00]  I ate Vanity's ass by a Minnesota stream.  Won't get paid.  If I pull my delicious cock  out of these velvet trousers,  I'm guaranteed to get laid.  Every day is my cum day.  All right?  Sunday's our rump day.  All right.  That's not even going to fuck her up the bus.  We got it, Jim.  Stick it in her bum day.  Yes.  Fucking... 
[01:01:30]  Got it.  All right.  Got to get shit on my dick today.  Hey.  Favorite Prince song?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Never a big Prince fan.  Me neither.  Sign of the Times I like.  I like Sign of the Times.  Don?  I always thought of him as...  And at the time,  not now in hindsight,  but at the time,  I thought of him as a Michael Jackson rip-off.  Really?  Because when he became popular  was when Thriller was out and shit 
[01:02:00]  and Michael Jackson was huge.  Yeah.  And I thought of him as like,  what's he trying to pull here?  I think Prince was a deeper Michael Jackson.  I agree.  He's a pretty great guy.  I think it's too deep  where it's like he's just making shit up  and people think it's profound,  but it's just shit he's throwing out.  What is this purple bullshit?  The sky was all purple.  It was fucking shit.  What is that?  You can't argue that Purple Rain  is not a good song.  I don't even get it.  I don't care.  Purple Rain is a great song.  Give us a little Purple Rain, Travis. 
[01:02:30]  What does it mean?  Listen to the words, man.  We'll dissect the fucking song  and we'll figure it out.  I'll dissect the song, all right.  Give me a little Purple Rain.  Give me a pith and a scalpel.  Don't ever get married.  Fucking Clarence Williams III  played his father.  Whatever, the movie's the movie.  The song makes no sense.  But did you find the live version?  No, this is it.  This is it.  No, I'm kidding.  That would have been funny.  This is a cover of Purple Rain.  Done by fucking Kathy Bates.  Turn this off.  He caught someone's sorrow. 
[01:03:00]  He didn't mean to.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He gave a girl the morning after pill  and she had a spontaneous miscarriage.  He feels guilty.  He tried telling some jokes.  Didn't work out.  I only want to see you landing in the Purple Rain.  What?  Purple Rain.  He wants Purple Rain. 
[01:03:30]  Who cares?  He wants to see a laughing in it.  What does that mean?  Shut up.  He's not a genius.  He wants rain gumdrops.  Rain.  Is that what it is?  To him, that's probably beautiful,  this raining purple stuff on a happy person.  He likes the color purple  and threw it in everything.  Either that or he wants to blacken her eyes  until she cries purple tears.  That could be it.  Oh, stop.  I like this.  He's a fucking black sleeves.  Shut up. 
[01:04:00]  In the purple, la la la.  Shut up.  Leave sleeves alone.  Sleeves kiss my ass.  Sleeves is deep.  I like that sleeves.  La la la.  Purple la la.  You see his video of him and his son  could care less.  Sledding.  I love Anthony.  Sledding on a very innocent winter day.  Stop.  Come on, this is good, man.  You don't like this?  This is fucking good.  No.  It's a dirge.  It's a dirge.  And I don't get what the purple part is. 
[01:04:30]  Stop it.  When Doves Cry is a great song.  What's that?  Only when Poe did it.  Side of the Time is a great song.  Purple Rain.  Ah, Danny.  Touched up a semi-nude picture of Prince.  Nude.  Purple Rain.  He wrote Nothing Compares to You.  Really?  Yes.  That's his song.  I think he wrote better songs than other people did than this purple shit.  The purple, little red Corvette, Raspberry Beret. 
[01:05:00]  What the fuck with the colors?  Stop it.  They're original, though.  No.  Raspberry Beret is a little fruity.  I like that.  Raspberry Beret.  Beret.  Hey, saw a girl.  She had a raspberry colored beret.  Did she?  Either that or she fucking, I was having a, that's when he was singing some JFK footage.  He had a raspberry beret.  But not when he left the house.  Raspberry Beret.  Raspberry Beret. 
[01:05:30]  A little red Corvette is what the limo turned into.  Oh, Oswald made a little red Corvette.  Raspberry Beret.  He could never make that shot.  He'll never make it to 1969.  Oh, it was in 1999.  Michael from New York City goes, oh, you're not seeing purple.  Purple brain.  Michael says, oh, you're not seeing purple as in the Vikings.  Maybe this whole song is about the Vikings. 
[01:06:00]  Everything was about the Vikings.  Maybe he's a lifelong Vikings fan, and that's what the whole damn purple thing's about.  Were they purple back then, too?  Hell, fuck it.  They've always been fucking purple.  You know what?  Able and Fran Tarkenton was playing.  Oh, yeah.  Hell, yeah.  Yeah?  Andy P from Atlanta, Darling Nikki, is the best Prince song ever.  Darling Nikki?  I don't know if that's my favorite Prince song.  Darling Nikki is a great song, and the Foo Fighters covered that.  Oh, yeah.  Yes, they did.  All right.  Darling Nikki's all right.  I like what other people do as shit.  Sinead did a good job with Nothing Compares to... 
[01:06:30]  Nothing Compares.  I like her version better than his.  With her big, stupid hearing aid monitors and her shaved head.  His is a fucking duet.  Yeah, that was a strong song, though, that Nothing Compares to you.  Oh, yeah.  And the video was just her face.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  I think I jacked off to that once.  She had a really...  A kid.  She had an angelic face.  She's very pretty.  She was a douche.  Oh, yeah, she was.  And then you saw it with some hair, and she was really hot.  I watched her video recently on SNL when she ripped up the Pope's picture, which you  know back then. 
[01:07:00]  That was a big move back then.  I don't know.  But she sang Bob Marley's War in acapella, which was fucking great.  I mean, it was an amazing fucking rendition of Marley's song.  Good voice, pretty girl, fucking dummy.  Yeah.  Fair enough.  Where'd she go?  Purple Rain.  Where is she now?  She's officially considered a one-hit wonder.  What?  When they do the one-hit wonder shows.  Is she?  Yep.  They pop her on as a one-hit wonder.  Wow.  Well, name another song she did.  There was one more I thought had popularity, but not like that.  She did something like Somebody Doesn't Wear Clothes. 
[01:07:30]  What the fuck is that song?  Look, man.  I didn't think we were going to talk about this shit today.  I would have did some Googling last night.  How about you put on one of the fucking songs?  That's what she looks like now?  No, no.  That's not her.  Let me see.  Stop.  She looks like a fucking-  Dyke!  She looks like a truck driver now.  Oh, my God.  Time.  Tick tock.  Stop it.  Holy-y.  No, God.  Who does she fucking-  She looks like Henry Rollins.  She really does look like a man. 
[01:08:00]  She grew her hair in just a little bit.  It's graying on the sides.  And she just does it-  That time is really a bitch.  God.  No one escapes that time shit.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  I am building a time machine.  What is going-  Is she pregnant there, or just-  No, she's enjoying her life.  Oh, enjoying her life.  Her belly looks like her head used to.  She's enjoying her life.  What do you want from her?  Oh, God.  That's discouraging. 
[01:08:30]  I don't know.  What is Prince's hero to song for the Vikings?  Oh, yeah.  Do we have it?  Oh, that's right.  I guess.  I have to hear it.  Nah, fuck it.  Come on.  I have to hear it.  How about Let's Go Crazy?  Let's Go Crazy.  It's all right.  Let's go-  Look how fucking good she looked there.  I would-  Skinny.  She looked all right.  Irish body.  Pussy must have stunk.  You think?  All hairy.  Hairy Irish pussy.  Yeah, just after a whole day of activism.  Nobody's pussy smells good after a day of activism.  It really sweats up a gas when you have a cause. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, all your self-righteous anger.  Yeah.  Your legs are always crossing and uncrossing in socially conscious meetings.  Hairy pussy tangled over each other.  She'd have pissed with the matted hair.  Her vag must have been in a fucking horror show.  Is there anything worse than a thinned out hairy pussy?  No.  Let's be honest with each other.  It was like Dan Haggerty's mouth.  If it's going to be hairy, you've got to make sure you can't see the forest floor.  You know, really?  Oh, yeah.  It's got to go below the fucking soil line.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  You don't want anything-  When it's all thinned out and long, that is the worst. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, that's her now?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, son of a bitch.  Terrible.  All right.  She looks like me.  Oh, my God.  A little bit.  She looks a little like Jimmy Norton in that picture, I must say.  Titties and said.  No.  Oh, her face.  Just because some people with OCD care.  It's Emperor's new clothes I was trying to come up with.  Oh.  All right.  Here's Prince's song for the Vikings.  It's called Purple and Gold.  Are you ready?  Purple and gold. 
[01:10:00]  Purple and gold.  He just throws that out there.  Yeah.  Praise every person, let it be known.  In the name of the purple and gold.  We come in the name of the purple and gold.  It's not as bad as like the other ones where they name the players. 
[01:10:30]  That's horrendous.  But it's not as bad.  It's the worst fight song ever.  No.  How You Doing is worse.  No.  How You Doing is better.  How You Doing.  No.  You know what it was?  This is horrible. 
[01:11:00]  It was a girl kind of singing with that high voice or hymn.  Who the fuck knows?  And it's like a dun, dun, dun, dun.  It sounds like a college fight song.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Long reign.  Yeah.  It's not.  Anyone could do that.  I wouldn't think that was Prince.  Right.  Prince should put his own fucking little sound to it.  It doesn't make me angry, though, like, ha, ha, you doing, and naming the players.  That really bugs me.  What do you mean?  Like this?  Hey, Joey Baseball.  Hey, Joey Baseball. 
[01:11:30]  Hey, no, so bad.  Where did the Yankees do it?  No, forget about it.  Forget about it.  What a year it's been.  My boy Chalutz called.  Hey, how come the Italian-Americans didn't get mad at this song?  Chalutz.  We're going to sing right now.  Because the Italians have a sense of humor.  Now they get mad at the Dresden Shore.  Oh.  How you doing?  Oh.  Oh.  How you doing?  How you doing?  One.  How you doing?  This is too chill-sitting.  Hey, is Ted in the room? 
[01:12:00]  Turn this down.  Hey, Mickey Mantle.  How's that liver?  He could be.  Well, somebody on my Twitter, Raspberry Beret, a little known fact, was a rip-off of a song  called Marmalade Hat.  Ah, see?  You might remember that song, Marmalade Hat.  I did not know that.  That came before Prince's Raspberry Beret.  Yeah.  I thought it was a tribute to that black guy that knocked the hat off of that woman in  the elevator.  It was white, but it was raspberry afterwards. 
[01:12:30]  She had a Frank Vincent hairdo.  The bitch got knocked out for mouthing off.  She had spinny walker wheels.  Hey, someone's breaking down Purple Rain for us.  Okay.  Somebody that listened to the words, man.  Eric in Boston, what do you got on this Purple Rain?  Hey, guys.  How we going?  Hey.  Good evening.  So, I can't really read it to you. 
[01:13:00]  It's on Prince.org, so I have to try to explain it.  Apparently, he uses the rain as a metaphor for people running away from problems in their  life.  Basically, he's saying you shouldn't run away from problems in your life.  You should face them.  I mean, he uses the rain as a metaphor in terms of the rain's not a big deal, but people  usually run away from it.  Does it?  Doesn't a metaphor have to have something in common with the real thing?  Rain?  He said, I want to see you standing in the Purple Rain. 
[01:13:30]  What's he saying?  I want to see you standing with your problems?  And why Purple?  Again, this is on, if you want to look it up, it's on Prince.org.  Maybe I'm not explaining it.  Oh, he wrote it.  All right.  Maybe that's what it is.  I think he's a lifelong Vikings fan, and he wants the players to just pee on him.  Okay.  Oh.  And, uh, oh, hey, guys.  By the way, the Pope's a pretty good song, too.  I don't know if you've heard of that one.  No, it's not.  Mm-mm.  It's not bad.  I think I know that one.  I don't even know it.  Oh, the Pope wears a pointy white hat. 
[01:14:00]  Do-de-de-doo.  Oh, I like that.  He says things about God that are nice.  Do-de-de-doo.  Do-de-de-doo.  Fucking do.  Oh, the Pope speaks Latin.  Do-de-de-doo.  The Pope lives in Rome.  Yes, he does.  Oh, the Pope likes God a whole big bunch.  And the Pope doesn't use dirty language.  Do-de-de-doo.  Do-de-de-doo. 
[01:14:30]  All right.  Take that.  Oh, the Pope leans his head out the window and boos at synagogues.  Oh, the Pope has good penmanship.  Do-de-de-doo.  No.  Because he has to.  Oh.  The Pope says T-H after a lot of words to sound holy.  He's in the Hitler Youth.  Was he?  Yeah, he was. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, that's right.  To-de-de-doo.  To-de-de-doo.  Oh, the Pope enjoys the view from the balcony.  To-de-de-doo.  The Pope's car has a piece of plastic on it.  To-de-de-doo.  You guys gotta make something.  Oh, the Pope doesn't have a Twitter account.  To-de-de-doo.  You know that?  Yes.  You know a little too much about the Pope, you weirdo.  You know everything about the Pope.  What about the kid-touching thing in the Pope? 
[01:15:30]  What do you got on that?  Oh, the Pope apologized for the church.  To-de-de-de-doo.  A lot of survivors of incest and...  Wait, wait.  A lot of survivors of sexual abuse were kind of happy about his apology.  Hoot-de-de-doo.  Oh, the Pope, when he apologized, his fingers were crossed.  Hoot-de-de-doo.  He actually liked that, that he apologized.  He apologized.  I fucking love that.  Yeah.  That is all right. 
[01:16:00]  They're all technically truthful things about the Pope.  Oh, the Pope likes a Bible in the hotel room drawer.  Booty-de-de-doo.  They're doing a story, how clean is your hotel room?  Dirty secrets on the GMA.  Whatever.  I want to hear that.  Yeah, me too.  I'm in hotels all the time.  My nickname is Hotel Teddy.  They just showed a light, that fluorescent light on the TV screen, and it looked like  fucking a lot of jizz.  Let's break this down.  Jimmy, how many hotel rooms a year? 
[01:16:30]  4,271.  Not counting Courtyard by Marriott.  Not in a good amount.  I'm away so much.  Have you ever had a problem?  The only thing I don't like is in the westerns, the sheets are very stiff and fucking, and  they put too much...  Cum?  No, no, no.  That's the pillows.  They put too much fucking starch in them.  Yeah.  After they itch my little sensitive boy skin.  Aww.  I have like burn victim sensitivity skin.  You need soft t-shirts.  But this is what I'm getting at.  The media sucks a dick.  Because, I mean, not one problem, Jimmy, and you travel all the time. 
[01:17:00]  Very few.  So it's not a real fucking issue.  Yeah, very few.  They're doing a whole fucking shindig on it.  It's the culture of fear.  It's the culture of fear.  Toodly-doo.  Oh, the Pope likes room service.  Toodly-doo.  He enjoys chicken noodle soup and a turkey burger.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  They're saying it's an instant hit, Jimmy.  Yes, it is.  Oh, this is an instant hit.  No.  The Pope doesn't watch HBO.  Toodly-doo.  What?  Because of the dirty language and sexual content. 
[01:17:30]  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Oh.  The Pope was overheard motherfucking AT&T service.  Toodly-doo.  He said this iPhone's a piece of shit and threw it off the balcony.  Whoodly-doo.  You're going to have to do this.  I remember that.  You're going to have to do this on stage.  No.  Yes, you're going to have to do this.  The Pope doesn't care about text messaging.  Whoodly-doo.  Because he has people that do it for him.  Whoodly-doo. 
[01:18:00]  The Pope never saw a monster rain.  Whoodly-doo.  And the Pope is not a big fan of the wire box at Whoodly-doo.  No.  The Pope really digs Mel Gibson's movies.  Whoodly-doo.  Especially the ones involving Jesus, etc.  Whoodly-doo.  Let me say hi to Steve in Connecticut.  Steve.  Yes.  Hello. 
[01:18:30]  Hello.  I'm gay in Connecticut.  C-T.  Cock-tease.  Hi, Steve.  The Pope is secretly envious of Uncle Paul.  Toodly-doo.  Oh, the Pope finds Steve's lifestyle abhorrent.  Toodly-doo.  Abhorrent.  Jesus.  I think that might be the first time that word receives on our show.  Oh, the Pope wants Satan to smite Steve C. 
[01:19:00]  Whoodly-doo.  Whoodly-doo.  Eh.  Second grade.  I fucking love it.  Whoodly-doo.  Whoodly-doo.  Eh, whatever.  Let me say hi to Travis in New Hampshire.  Travis.  Oh, Travis.  Hey.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey.  How possible is it to, um, listen to this in auto-tune?  I don't know if we're going to have to punch this up in auto-tune.  I agree.  I think we got a hit just as is. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, believe me.  Someone will write music for it.  It'll be done.  Yes.  Jimmy will be on there.  Toodly-doo.  You're rolling with the Pope.  The Pope thinks Van Halen was overrated.  Whoodly-doo.  And that lyrically they were childish and shitty.  Whoodly-doo.  The Pope thinks David Lee Roth's radio show was kind of funny.  Whoodly-doo.  I know all about the Pope.  I certainly do.  Whoop. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Uh, Larry King checking in.  Larry King.  Oh, the Pope thinks Larry King is an irrelevant ass.  Toodly-doo.  Right.  Larry.  Pope, how important is the hoodly-doo?  Oh, boy.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Oh, the Pope dropped the C-bomb when he hit the flight coach.  Hoodly-doo.  People want in now.  We're going to give them a chance. 
[01:20:30]  Nate and, uh.  Good evening.  In New York City, Nate.  Oh, the Pope likes to wear sensible shoes.  Hoodly-doo.  Does.  Seems to know about the Pope.  Oh, he's comfortable.  Yes.  Of course.  The Pope likes Nike shocks.  Hoodly-doo.  Oh, the Pope has good arches.  Hoodly-doo.  I can't say half of these.

It's too early to get them, but it's the Wounded Warrior Project.  It really helps military personnel who are severely injured during wartime conflicts.  They do a great job.  Yeah, they really do, man.  They take care of these people.  It'll be a good time in Mulcahy's.  No, I'm just saying, for the people that go down there.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.  They put together a nice little thing every year.  And, yeah, he was killed by a sniper and James McNaughton, so this will be the fifth year they're doing the benefits.

[02:11:00]  Bananas tonight  and tomorrow  South  where  Route 17 South  Hasbrook Heights New Jersey  yeah  ok  we'll continue  thanks  alright  we got the tap out guys  coming in studio  punk ass  and skyscraper  from tap out  T clothing  tap out  tap out clothing  god damn  hey man  he has the same hair  as Sam  yeah  look at that man  you guys got the same hair  must be shy  that's his brother 
[02:11:30]  for the name of my brother  what's up guys  what's up guys  see  you guys  they told us  we were bringing strippers in  that's why you gave us  the couch huh  we wish  yeah we wish  a man in this  fucking room up  instead we're talking  to Twinks  yeah Twinkie  did you get the last break  nah  oh ok  we turned everything  down out there  this guy's trying to  shove this thing  in my fucking throat  that's more masculine  than what was happening  before you came in  there we go  it was fucking horrifying  why are you guys in town 
[02:12:00]  first of all  we're in town  for the international  motorcycle show  right  we had somebody  build us  somebody built us  a couple street bikes  and  can you come  fucking check it out  can you come  fucking check it out  just fucking check it out  I like that  check it out  what do you think  about  they said that Lesnar  is going to be ready  to fight again  sometime over the summer  I mean do you think  you think he'll be ready  or no  you know we were just 
[02:12:30]  talking about  I think yeah  you know he's such a  big guy  and Punk has said  you know his very  first fight  was against Frank Mir  and he was  whooping his ass  for a minute  and just got caught  so I think he's  going to come back in  and his first fight  will be the winner  between Mir  and Carwin  I think  but what happened  to him  I mean it was  literally a miracle  I mean he healed  he healed himself  maybe it was  some hype  you never know  hold on  hold on  let's slow down  with this  yeah  because we did  this whole thing  yesterday  I mean 
[02:13:00]  hole in his stomach  even though  I think he meant  to say a hole  in his colon  and he's saying  he fucking healed  himself  instead of the doctor  taking out his colon  he said he healed  him fucking self  yeah that's what he said  with Daniel White  on the ESPN  and we said yesterday  something doesn't  make sense here  that ain't right  well they said  that there's like  a 1% chance  that you can heal  you know  you could heal  your body will heal itself  and you could need  some holistic medicine  and shit like that  and it actually worked  but you know  the doctor in Canada  was just gonna fucking  put a colostomy bag  on him  and that was it  it was a wrap 
[02:13:30]  he was gonna walk  around with a bag  nice health care  up there  they were talking  early on  that he may never  fight again  so  right  it went from  not fighting  ever again  to I healed  myself  and I'll be  fighting  but could you  fight with  a colostomy bag  no what if that  shit popped  when you're in there  tap out  there it is  yeah  that's a good way  to win  you take a little  needle in there  and pop the bag  and get shit  on the other guy  and just make him  quit  what do you guys  think happened  I'm calling BS  you are right  maybe  I think so 
[02:14:00]  I think it was  some kind of  some other shit  going on  and they made up  some  what the fuck  is diverticulitis  anyways  what the fuck  has anybody  ever heard of that  it's a weird  thing that happens  when a seed  or something  gets caught  or a nut  in your colon  and it causes  an infection  and I think  the pus  it is a weird  I thought it was  the new kids  on the block  thing  you know  they're talking  about you  swallowed too  much of that  fucking  jizz  and shit  and I  am protecting you  from Brock  when he comes 
[02:14:30]  running to you  what the fuck  is wrong  I need you guys  this big man  over here  he's like  fucking lurch  he walks around  he don't say  nothing  I thought he was  a fucking CIA  earlier  he had nothing  to laugh about  now he's a robot  Jordan from  Scranton PA  says Brock  Lesnar doesn't  strike me as  the holistic  medicine type  of guy  I'm with you  maybe he  fucking mounted  his wife  Jesus Christ  man  I'm assuming  you're not a  fan of Brock  Lesnar  he's a good 
[02:15:00]  guy  but he doesn't  you guys  know  he doesn't  wear any  tap on  anything  he doesn't  sponsor him  death clutch  death clutch  are you making  fun of death clutch  see now you're  fucking with him  now you're gonna  get us kicked  it is funny though  that you guys  started out  the whole  clothing MMA  line  you guys  were there  at the beginning  of it  but now  everybody's  trying to  come up  with a  badass  death clutch  grappling  angler 
[02:15:30]  eye poke  everybody has  these fucked up  names  everybody wants  to come up  with some  clothing line  seems to have  been pretty  profitable  I guess  making a few  bucks  a few bucks  you guys  like 200  million dollars  a year  you did your  math  I didn't do  math  I just did  YouTube  I'm really  dumb  I can't  do math  how many  years has  tap up  been in  existence  we started  in 97  wow  96  97  ok so you  got in  kind of  at the  beginning  oh yeah 
[02:16:00]  oh definitely  yeah you  guys  but you  still go  I mean  you're  UFC  you go  to the  big events  but you  still go  to those  little  fucking  like in  a ball  room  you still  go to  shows  with  sunlight  we've been  in some  crazy  shows  man  they used  to be  totally  illegal  in  California  so when  we were  going to  shows  they were  underground  you know  the typical  you walk in  we remember  going to this  one in  Compton  U-Haul  dealership  you had to  give a secret  name  and  20 bucks  and they  let you  in the  back door  and opened 
[02:16:30]  up  and there  was a  big old  cage  in there  you know  we've  been in  the fights  where  biker gang  stabbing  people  and fights  breaking out  and getting  people stabbed  in the crowd  and  ghetto  shit  back then  and they  don't have  rules in  some of  those fights  too  I mean  some of  those  illegal  underground  fights  you can  still headbutt  and do  some weird  shit  right  I don't  think it's  legal but  the refs  kind of  turn a  blind eye  to it  that's why  it's glad  it's cleaned  up now  it's not  really like  that anymore  now  even the  underground  I mean  the ones  the smaller  ones still  have good 
[02:17:00]  refs  and medical  people don't  realize that  there's this  big underground  I mean  you see the  UFC  but  a lot  of these  guys are  fighting  in shit  venues  there's  8 people  and a fat  lady  and they're  making 10  bucks  10 bucks  and they're  getting the  shit kicked  out of  we used to  go to this  fight where  they had  the guys  that love it  you just  to pay  75 bucks  to fight  you had to  pay the  athletic  commission  or whatever  it was  to give  you the  fucking  physical  you had  to pay  to fight  75 bucks  now here  our googly 
[02:17:30]  eyed governor  is going to  be passing  cage fighting  here  that's what  I heard  when we got  in town  that's what  everybody was  saying  because it's  all financial  it has nothing  to do with  anything  New York's  broke  this guy's  got to come  up with  something  he's taxing  soda  he's taxing  everything  and then he  figures  we'll  allow this  fighting  and then  tax the  fuck out  of it  they figured  that shit  out because  it's all  in New Jersey  right now  I'll bet  he  what's the  only state  that you  can't do  it in  right  is New York  Boston  I think 
[02:18:00]  there's a  couple  other  state of  Boston  the rest  of Massachusetts  can do it  yeah I think  there's a few  states nobody  wants to throw  a UFC  in  yeah  what the  fuck states  are they  pussies  fuck them  Nebraska  fags  is it  Alaska  can you  do it  in Alaska  yeah  lots of  fights  actually  in Alaska  right now  fucking  women are  fighting up  there  flat back  women  it's actually  pretty big  fucking  shoulders  monsters  from Bugs Bunny  are coming in  so you guys 
[02:18:30]  had a TV show  too man  is it going on  a second season  right now  we had two  seasons come out  the first two  were on  Versus Network  same as WEC  yeah  and then  DirecTV  dropped them  so all that  was coming  so we backed  out  we have to  break in  for one second  we have a  phone call  yes we do  which I think  we're going to  get back to  the tap out  guys  it's a comedian  Tammy Pescatelli  Tammy Pescatelli  are you on the line  I am you guys  and I'm a huge fan  and I thought  that bit 
[02:19:00]  sucks too  don't kid yourself  oh no  what the gay bit  no no no  the whole thing  about this  it's  Jim  Bob  you guys know  man  it's like from  it's 2005  wait you're admitting  that the bit  we played sucked  I hate it  I love Tammy  you know what  I just fucking  hold on  I just  nothing but respect  to Tammy now  yeah vote for Tammy  honestly Tammy  that bit is a little rough  they should have gave you  like a better bit  let me tell you something 
[02:19:30]  here's the thing  I am not in  by any stretch of  imagination  with Comedy Central  they have their boys  that's so cool  I just happen to be  a chick who literally  said hey  vote for me  and I got a bunch  of dweeds  saying  Wizard of Warcraft  voting for me  700,000 times  you know what I mean  you just can't ask people  I never said I was  funnier than anybody  but you know  I'm happy that it  works  but what do you get  we were fucking  vicious  we were really bad  actually I don't think  we weren't that bad 
[02:20:00]  it was horrible  we were vicious  I made fun of your accent  just because you  reminded me of fucking  who's the guy from  Midnight Run  Robert De Niro  if that would be  Robert De Niro  I think I would take it  no not De Niro  it was the ex-cop  I'll fucking stab you  with this pencil  yeah Sydney  have a cream soda  relax  relax  you know what's funny  I love that at least  you guys don't even  admit that I'm a chick  you know what I mean  if the worst thing  that I was talking about  is being Italian  then who cares  you know at least  I'm a female comic  and no one even 
[02:20:30]  thinks of that  I don't do any  of that male bashing  how old was that  how old was the clip  2005  I mean you know  they don't give you  a break over there  at Comedy Central  unless you live over there  it is a really weird  thing these contests  they have  I don't understand  how they make  the decisions  on what clip to show  because it's not  the artist picking the clip  no it's some guy  in the room  it's some  the web guy  and  fucking Tammy's got  balls though  yeah  god bless you  Tammy  it is what it is  now I think  we're going to  become friends  now you've got to  come in here  and hang with us 
[02:21:00]  I love  I've always been  like a huge fan  because you just  stay true  Jimmy your bits  on Jay are hilarious  by the way  thank you  some of them  have been really good  and some I'd rather  fix but  I love how these  comics are going to  say that they're  on team Conan  and then they're  not going to work  until he works  yeah it's really weird  how everybody's just  taking sides  and it's like  why are you going  to shit on Leno  he's going back  to the Tonight Show  I don't understand  why any comic  would do that  even if you hate Jay  why would you  shit on him  it doesn't make sense  because that's what 
[02:21:30]  comics do  I don't really care  I just go do my bit  I never thought I was  the funniest comic  in the world  I hope that people  would show up  laugh  and then you go home  and you take your check  and you realize  what a loser you are  because you're in a hotel  and no one gives a shit  where you are  yeah  it's so weird  and Tammy's hot too  I mean she's a sexy chick  yeah it's so weird  to hear her say  I'm alone in a hotel room  why  yeah you can be  with anyone  when you're on the road  let me open for you  now I'm married  do you know that  now I'm married  I have a baby  and I am  it's just like 
[02:22:00]  it's just not what  I thought it was  going to be  took the Bonnie  McFarlane route  I guess  you know what I mean  like who knew  that  I'm still on the road  though because  I did it for Sprite  they told me like  you can't be pregnant  on stage  I'm like well  apparently you've never  been to a bad strip club  because I can  well come  what do you get  to be in New York  I'm there all the time  but I'll come visit you guys  because my mother-in-law  lives there  and she's crazy  so it would be great  to get away from her  Tammy where are you 
[02:22:30]  this weekend  this weekend  I'm at a  I just left  I just left  Stevens Institute of Technology  and I'm taking the weekend off  next week I'm in Seattle  alright  very good  crazy  hey Tammy  guys thanks for  listen I'm sorry  to interrupt you  but I don't mind  I hate that whole special  I don't want it to play  so you know  I wish they would  give me something else  so good luck to you  and I'm sorry to interrupt  I'll run on  move to Tammy  hey that's okay  I'm looking at  this guy's got a picture 
[02:23:00]  of you up here  and you're doing alright  yeah Tammy's alright  Tammy is alright  holy shit  thanks Tammy  it takes balls  for her to call  well that's just the true comic  it's like as a comic  you look at a bit  that's on the net  and you're like  fuck why did they  pick that bit  well cause you guys  even said she's funny  and then we're looking  at this clip  going eh  and you know  and she fucking  alright  she called in  gotta give it to her  tap out guys  sorry  punk ass  and skyscraper  that just finished up  something that we  did earlier  sometimes you're  fucking goofing  on something 
[02:23:30]  and the person  hears  I'm still worried  about Brock  we just have  Tammy on our ass  not Brock  Tammy Pescatelli  these guys gotta deal  with fucking Lesnar  that shit ain't funny  guys  fuck that  I wanna know more about  sick Brock  would beat the shit  out of anybody  all of us in this room  together  I wanna know more  about the beginning  of tap out  because now everyone  knows it's making  like hundreds of  millions of dollars  a year  but it started as  a nothing company  could you walk us  through that  without making it  boring 
[02:24:00]  like a quick story  from nothing  to where  we were following  the sport  we were big fans  of the sport  and the sport  didn't have any  clothing attached to it  and all the other  sports do  Adidas and soccer  and Nike  and basketball  or football  so we just wanted  to make a shirt  that represented that  and we came up  with a shirt  and we were having fun  it was just really  about having fun  we were traveling  all over  trying to sell  our goods  out of our  trunk of our car  what to the fans  and the fights 
[02:24:30]  we were going  to all the small  shows in California  Indiana  Hawaii  wherever they were  throwing shows  that we were flying  out there  getting kicked out  of a lot of shows  and we'd show up  and you know  somebody promised us  you know you come  in and sell your clothes  at the next show  we'd show up  and they'd go  oh we got these  other people  get out of here  we'd show up again  oh next time  you can come  so finally  there was a point  where we started  buying  we'd go to the city  and rent property  you know  in front of a  fucking jack-in-the-box  and set up a tent  and put some  banners up  that you had to pass  to get to the show  and we'd sell our clothes  you know getting arrested  we you know 
[02:25:00]  punk ass got arrested  at a fight  because it was  you know underground  illegal fight  and cops showed up  we'd grab our shit  start running  and you know  I wasn't leaving  all the shit  I ain't leaving  all this stuff  it cost us too much  we couldn't afford to  so I just hung out  and said hey  this is my shit  don't steal it  and how did it explode  obviously you're doing  the slow build  but what was the event  where it just went  ultimate fighter  the first ultimate fighter  the first season  one finale  yeah we always had growth  but when that first  ultimate fighter hit  it literally shut down 
[02:25:30]  our website  we were so crazy  because you had the tap out  on the map  yeah we had tap out  Rich Franklin  was wearing a shirt  Diego Sanchez  was wearing a shirt  they actually threw  our website up  at one point  on the screen  on TV  for the viewers at home  and about then  our website crashed  and then our web guy  got it back up  I was on the phone  until like 2 o'clock  in the morning  we were at one point  getting about  6,000 orders an hour  and then the bank  you know  it was such an influx  from what we were making  to then  the bank was withholding  all our money 
[02:26:00]  and punk ass  I remember punk ass  was throwing chairs  through doors  because they wouldn't  give us the money  for months  you know what I mean  out in the street  oh they thought  maybe you were  they thought some  fishy shit was going on  so  are you guys fighters  we trained  we trained  with some of those guys  all the guys  that fight in the UFC  or at least the older guys  but you were a fighter  before you started  this clothing line  well yeah  we were fighting  we weren't like  at the level  these UFC guys are  it was you and Mask  and then  how did you come in  Skyscraper 
[02:26:30]  I came in  Charles had bought  a place  or rented a room  from a friend of ours  from a friend of mine  in Huntington Beach  and I just  right after he started  right after they started  and I was kind of  that fucking kid  that was always  hanging around  you know  just fucking  you need somebody  to fucking carry  this shit  yeah  pretty much  and I had watched  UFC since UFC won  and nobody knew  what tap out meant  around besides me  and my brother  he was the only guy  that would show up  and punk ass  was working a couple  jobs at the time 
[02:27:00]  so Charles was going  to these jiu jitsu  tournaments and fights  by himself a lot  so I just started  going with him  you know  selling the stuff  with him  they had like a  I remember going  over to their house  it was like a  bitch fest over there  every time  they would be like  it was all these guys  that lived in this  one house  and so everybody  would you know  it was like a  magnet house  everybody would go  this is Charles  this is Charles  at the house  it was a party house  you know  it was always bitches  and Charles would  be in his room  in the back of the house  and at about  2 o'clock  he'd open his door  and he'd  he'd grab a bitch  and pull him  in his room  and then  that's all  you'd see him  he's like a 
[02:27:30]  Venus  that's how he did it  that's exactly  I swear to god  that's what he would do  he didn't party  or drink or nothing  so he'd hang out  in his room  and he'd be working  or whatever  and then about  2 o'clock  he'd peek his head out  he'd go start  rapping with a chick  pull her back  in the room  nice  she'd come out  with a black eye  she'd come out  walking like  fucking legs  6 feet apart  she had stitches  that he put in  what type of shirt  am I wearing  I have a UFC shirt  there you go  yeah  that's nice  that's not you guys  no it's a UFC shirt  we're big sponsors 
[02:28:00]  of the UFC  we're the main sponsor  for the ultimate fighter  we sponsor the WEC  which is also owned  by the UFC people  you sponsor Mike Straka  show  yeah  Mike Straka show  oh ok yeah  I like that guy a lot  Mike's got a good show  and so you've got  you've got Liddell  you've got a lot of fighters  that wear your stuff  yeah yeah  how much does that help  the live events  people see these guys  walking around  they have to want to buy it  yeah yeah  and that we're doing  with the fighters  you know Liddell  Nate Marquard  a lot of these guys  we do signature shirts  where they get their own shirt  with their name on it  it's kind of their own business  what's the top selling one 
[02:28:30]  I think I know  but Dan Henderson  Henderson  Hendo yeah  because you put the American flag on  after he knocked out Bisping  yeah  that shirt actually  he got some big checks  I bought it  it's a good shirt  what shirt is that  I haven't seen it  the one  the Hendo shirt  it's got the American flag  going down  it's got the American flag  that was one of the greatest  knockouts I've ever seen  you know  at the MMA award show  this couple months ago  it won knockout of the year  when he's fucking  laying on the ground  and he's like  yeah one more for you  fuck 
[02:29:00]  the second one  was the shit  because he actually  left his whole body  yeah there you go  there it is  yeah yeah  that's actually a great shirt  you know hey  we've done a bunch of signings  with Hendo  and people will bring  you know  four foot fucking pictures  of him in the air  getting ready to  throw that last blow on him  but nothing is touching  the ground  he's literally  like two feet off the ground  that's awesome  the second punch  after he was knocked out  he literally  jumped up in the air  swung his fist  he left  he was like Superman  and just punched him  right in the fucking shit  could you google that  Danny Henderson 
[02:29:30]  knocking off  and he was already unconscious  when that second punch  was coming  yeah that was a great shot  he was knocked out  with that  oh what a punch  that was at the  I've told the story before  that was at the headline fight  was uh  was Mir and uh  and Lesnar  Lesnar UFC 100  and um  afterwards  90 something  we're backstage  with Reed Harris  and uh  and uh  Frank Mir walks by  and you never know  what to say to a beaten fighter  it's awkward  well first of all  Brock walks by  I mean this is literally  right after the fight  we ran backstage  to you know  see them  and Brock walks 
[02:30:00]  we all of us  me and Norton  just bow our heads  because he's such a  fucking alpha male  like yeah  fucking sees him a lot  we just rolled on our stomachs  we actually  we actually opened our assholes  like a orangutan  presented  and then  and then uh  yeah you don't want to  lick that guy in the eye  no what did you say  to Frank Mir  and then yeah  then Frank Mir  was coming down  I'm a big fan  I love Frank Mir  I'm a really big fan of him  and I really wanted him  to beat Brock  really bad  because I love that  he fucking tapped him out  that's why you love the sport 
[02:30:30]  I think I lost money  on that fight too  well that's why you love it  because back in the day  you know  Hoist Gracie  some little fucking  175 pound guy  is beating the shit  out of a guy  with a mohawk  and Jesus tattoo  on his stomach  270 pounds  you know  yeah  that's why you love it  and I  you know  and he lost  and his face was all fine  he's walking down  I was very nervous  and I went  good job Frank  good job Frank  that's the wrong thing to say  what did you say  him  there you go  there it is  look  look at the video  bam 
[02:31:00]  that was a  oh shit  look at it  look at it  airborne  bam  that's an elbow  that's an elbow  that's not even a punch  I think that was a  that's unbelievable  he was out  hey you guys are  he's lucky he was out for that  in the second one  yeah  you guys are sponsoring  Herschel Walker  as he tries to do this  fight thing  is he going to try that  you know what  I'll tell you this real quick  Bob Cook  who's the coach of  Josh Kosjag  John Fitch  a lot of those guys  I seen him at WEC  a while back  and I knew 
[02:31:30]  Herschel was training  with him  so I said  I pulled him aside  I said bro  because I'm like  Herschel's a great  fucking guy  he's a nice guy  and I'm like going  oh he's going to get  his ass kicked  you know  yeah he's an athlete  and all that  but this is different  we've seen football  players come in  and get hurt  and so I pulled him  aside and I said  what do you think  about him  he goes bro  the best athlete  I've ever had  in my gym  ever was  Mike Van Arsdale  you know he's a coach  at Greg Jackson  out there in New Mexico  he said Herschel Walker  at 47  is the best athlete  I've ever seen  come on  ever  bro honest to god 
[02:32:00]  that's what he said  maybe not the most  skilled fighter yet  he said I put  an all American  college wrestler  against him  couldn't take him down  he said I put  a K1 kickboxer  against him  Herschel rocked him  and dropped him  he said he just  he likes to get hit  he don't shy away from it  and he's just  a fucking athlete  who looks like that  at 47  he's a heavyweight  right  so what's his experience  yeah I think  he's fighting  a heavyweight  what's his experience  going into this fight  Olympic bobsledding  no I know  a little of everything  he's been doing 
[02:32:30]  martial arts  for like 30 years  but you know  kickball  you know  taekwondo  oh he's a martial artist  yeah he's a black belt  in taekwondo  yeah he said  he'd go to practice  and he'd get done  and he'd go over  and fight in a  taekwondo tournament  yeah yeah  he'd go football practice  over to taekwondo  oh okay  I've never read about  any of this shit  I didn't know that  I just knew he was  a little crazy  after that fucking  stuff came out  he'd want a fucking  30 year black belt  hearing voices  that's good  he's got a split  personality right  everything's going on  Shaq wants to fight  now too  as soon as I get  retired I'm going  to go fight  he's going to tap 
[02:33:00]  people out of  this fucking huge  hog resting  on their throat  I heard Shaq  has like 7  you know how awful  a 7 inch dick  looks on a guy  of that size  horrible  how many fuck  do you know  he has a 7 inch dick  I don't remember  what I heard  someone just said  it's an average dick  like a regular dick  like 7 or 8  yeah  that's great  great  okay so Hershel  won's his first fight  in a couple weeks  out in Florida  a week or two  or something like that  yeah  you guys don't just  work with UFC  you work with everybody  I mean you have  Frank Shamrock  you have the  country guys 
[02:33:30]  Strikeforce  but we have  fighters everywhere  but we sponsor  the UFC  as far as  sponsoring the show  itself  is the only show  we sponsor  UFC and WEC  now why do you think  we talked about  but why do you think  Fedor did not sign  with UFC  do you think that  was a money thing  or I wanted it  on some level  and I like Fedor  but if his people  were afraid of Lesnar  that Brock would  beat him  and just destroy  that unbeatable image  I think Brock  would beat him  really  I mean yeah  I think so  I think Brock  is this monster  that he's so athletic 
[02:34:00]  and there's something  to that  and he's so big  and powerful  I mean  Fedor's not a big dude  really  he's just trying  not to get killed  by Brock anymore  I think he would  hey  you saw Fedor fight that  he's right  he's right  I've always said  Brock would beat  everybody  but Fedor  Fedor fought that  fucking 7 foot 9  Korean dude  the guy was on top  of him  and he still  tapped him up  yeah but  did you see the way  he held Mir down  I mean Mir didn't even  I mean Mir is a very  skilled fighter  he's been fighting 
[02:34:30]  for a long time  one of the best  jujitsu guys there is  it was like he was  holding his 10 year old  kid down  that was an uncomfortable  beating to watch  because that's how  I would get beat up  my one arm  would be stuck behind me  and my fucking fat face  would just be begging  for a fist  it would just be  a nice easy target  dude it was really weird  to see a man  that's a great way  to look at it  yeah and it's true  because I kept thinking  Mir fucking get your arm out  and just roll into him  or something  but he didn't do anything  yeah nothing  he couldn't do shit  don't you think  that that was  I kind of fucking hated that 
[02:35:00]  because I mean yeah  he is  I mean he comes in  at what 265  but immediately goes up  to 285 290  within a half hour  and then  you know  and then he goes in  I mean he's lying  on top of the fucking guy  what are you going to do  you know what I mean  nothing  after his first fight  with Mir I said  hey this guy  give him a couple  jiu jitsu classes  and he's going to  kill everybody  can he take a punch though  because Couture  really fought him  very tough  you know Randy's  an older guy  can he really take a shot  like someone 
[02:35:30]  to fade over  throw at him  I hope Shane Carwin  you know I want to see  Shane Carwin fight him  because Shane Carwin  is a big fucking guy  Shane has bigger hands  than fucking Brock  yeah and he's 6'4  you know he's not  you know he's bigger  than Mir in those guys  so I'd like to see  that fight  and he's a wrestler too  yeah he's a motherfucker  when does Couture  fight Mir  is it 109  is it 109  fuck I don't know  there's so many UFCs now  it's hard to know  I think it's in March  let me see  is it March  yeah the Frank Mir 
[02:36:00]  Shane Carwin  that's in March  yeah that should be  I mean  there's a good fight  I mean that's  that's the fight  I'd really like to see  Carwin and Mir  yeah Carwin and Mir  it's going to be a good fight  yeah that's a good fight  you know that's the best  part about the UFC  I like both of those guys  yeah UFC 111 in Jersey  oh where is it  it's in Newark right  Continental or  who else is fighting  BJ's  no BJ's fighting  Frankie Edgar  yeah he's fighting  but not here  who's  St. Pierre's fighting  on that card  that card is  St. Pierre and Hardy  yeah that's going to be  a great fight 
[02:36:30]  he's in the best  physical condition  I've ever seen  it's annoying  I'm just watching him  jump up like bounce  up and down  before his fight  yeah I just read  something about  his coach was saying  that he's in  he's in better shape  he's ever seen him in  yeah he's really  which is fucking  saddening because  the thing is  we went to the weigh-ins  and you don't  you see these guys  on TV like  wow they're in shape  but when you see  these motherfuckers live  they look like  like humans without skin  it's just muscle  yeah  well that's  they're the best  athletes in the world  that's what we believe  anyways  I mean you compare 
[02:37:00]  them to some of the  I mean you know  basketball players  they're definitely in shape  running across  back and forth  all day long  but I think  they're the best  athletes in the world  why the white guy  domination in this sport  seems a little odd  I don't know  I don't know  maybe because it comes  from original martial arts  and you kind of see  it's dominated by  that's true  alright  just wondering  I'd bring race into it  you know  just thought I was  getting some race  that's slowly  it's slowly changing now  John Jones  yeah  John Jones  is a motherfucker 
[02:37:30]  Brett Rogers  he looked like  he was doing pretty well  until that fucking  one punch  yeah  until that one punch  it's always  until that one punch  especially with Fedor  that guy fought Fedor  and you know  the only fights he had  before  they were all outside  fights with like  carnivals going on  in the background  and then he's fucking  fighting  you know  you see little girls  with cotton candy  watching the fight  and then you see him  fighting Fedor  it's like come on  fuck it  he's a tough guy  but there's no way  he was going to fucking  what about Kimbo  see Kimbo 
[02:38:00]  you guys represent  yeah we got Kimbo  how's he doing lately  I know he was on the show  and all  but yeah  you know  and then he beat  Houston Alexander  on the  ultimate fighter finale  that annoyed the shit  out of me  yeah  what's Houston doing  I don't know what  his game plan was  but it wasn't  what is he fighting next  Kimbo  he's fighting  he's supposed to be  fighting Matt Mitrione  coming up in a couple  months  like two months  or something like that  yeah  and Rampage is back  I hear  yeah  and Paige Jackson  is going back  we sponsor him too  well he went and did 
[02:38:30]  the A-Team movie  and now he's back  fighting  oh yeah  he did come back  UFC 114  I think they're saying  is where he's fighting  I think he's going to  he went back to finish up  his contract  didn't he  what was the sentence  he just got too  they wrapped up  his legal trouble  I think  what was it  Florida  no  California  California  right by me  what was the  he's got like  probation or something  like that  like three years probation  nobody got  I don't know  yeah  it was not  community service  you have to tell  all the neighbors  stand out on the  corner with a sign  point to his van  that's mine  if you see this going  quickly  we were at that  fight too 
[02:39:00]  when he lost that  fight  and then he lost  his mind  I didn't think  he should have  lost that fight  I thought that was  a bad decision  which one was that  hootie fight  Forrest  and I said that  I've been saying  that a lot  except when Forrest  was here  I was like  man  you won that fight  yeah it was a good  call for them  Forrest is a scary  he's a scary dude  a little  dude I saw him  two weeks later  in an event  I could have been  fucking Moms Mabley  he had no recognition  of me whatsoever  he got one ball  or something  what the fuck  was he telling us  does he  yeah is that it  he has one nut  I think he has  one nut 
[02:39:30]  that he lost  you guys know  the underground  it's MMA.tv  or some shit  like that  it's a forum  where people talk  and after  Anderson  abused him  they put a  clip of the movie  Forrest Gump  where Forrest is  running from that  truck  and he runs  across the football  field  well they put  Anderson Silva's  head  on the dude  in the back  of the truck  and they put  Forrest Griffin's  head on  Forrest Gump  and so it was  chasing him  because he ran  out of the arena  in the back  I was at that show 
[02:40:00]  that was great  he was so bummed out  yeah I was at the  Philly show  he was so bummed  oh man  we haven't heard  from him since  really  Forrest  yeah  he hadn't done much  he ran out of the arena  Bobby  knocked out  popped up  and he was gone  but he didn't even  get knocked out  I mean that was  a fucking  it was almost  like a jab  he knocked him  out  he ran into it  like hey get off me  yeah he was  taunting him and shit  putting his hands down  I was embarrassed  I felt embarrassed  I'd fucking run  out of the ring too  he was bummed out  man  who was putting 
[02:40:30]  his hands down  something  yeah he was  just like  fucking  he was doing  some Ali shit  which he never  really does  he's pretty  he just fuck  he did some  like a flick  he just flicked  his hand out  and knocked him  Forrest was coming  at him to throw  a punch  and knocked him  the fuck out  it was pretty  fucking embarrassing  and then he  I hate when you  see the fighter  they're out of it  but they're still  in it  and they're  actually trying  to grab somebody  or they grab  the ref  that's the best  yeah they take  the ref down  they're trying  to take the ref  down  the ref's like  get off me  asshole 
[02:41:00]  it's over  your fucking  toes are told  but credit to  those guys  because they  want to keep  fighting  they don't  give a shit  who it is  they're just  off of natural  instinct  trying to keep  fighting  so yeah  that's crazy  you guys  represent Hardy  too  he's fighting  Saint-Pierre  right  and who do you  think is going  to win that one  that's a tough  fight man  I don't see  anybody beating  Saint-Pierre  but you sponsor  the guy who's  fighting  he's got a  puncher's chance  yeah I mean  well I mean  he just  damn I wouldn't 
[02:41:30]  want to fight  Saint-Pierre  nah  yeah Saint-Pierre's  a badass  he is  what was like  the first really  cool thing you  bought when you  got rich  yeah  Lamborghini  no Lamborghini  no shit really  yeah  yeah you bought  a Lambo  well fucking  why not  yeah  you know what  it was kind of  we would  we would get  done with a show  we'd go drive  by the Lamborghini  dealership  and look through  the window  Ferrari dealership  just kind of like  one day  one day  nah  nah  I could sell it  but it was just  kind of  now you're just like  yeah fuck this thing

[02:45:00]  him fucking karate  it was Arnold  all right  what you want  to do is this  he was Arnold  Al Delvecchio  was fucking  that'd be  mix the meatballs  so what  you got shows  coming back on  is your show  on Versus  coming back on  not on Versus  we're working  not on Versus  it'll be on  now you're gonna  do the show  but it's gonna  be different  because you know  we just filmed  the pilot  we're still working  on what network  it's going to  that must have  been hard  when he passed  away right  yeah  he's the founder  of the company  yeah  and our best friend 
[02:45:30]  not even on  a business side  just on a personal  side  we're day in  day out  for the past  12-15 years  we've been in  this studio  before  doing one of  the MMA shows  over a series  and you know  we went over  there to look  for a signature  on there  but they had  switched out  the things  already  but it's  just  it's hard  sometimes  I know we  got in a car  accident  but was it  somebody else's  fault  drunk driver  he was in his  Ferrari  and some  drunk driver  fucking clipped  them  they were  probably doing  100-110 
[02:46:00]  the guy was  in like some  old 70's  Porsche  supposedly he was  trying to  you know  catch up  so we can  let the  bitch in the  passenger seat  see the  Ferrari  and he hit  a curb  and then  he was drunk  and the whole  street was  kind of turning  so he hit  the curb  and bounced  off of it  and hit  Charles'  car  and then  Charles  hit a pole  how about  the guy  is the other  guy dead  too  no no  he fucking  he tried  to drive away  right now  he spun out  up a curb  down the curb  and then  luckily there was  a cop going  the other way 
[02:46:30]  who saw  he was off  duty or something  and came around  and as he came  back up  the guy was  driving off  but he had  flat tires  and then he  parked and  got out and  started running  and the cop  got him  and it was  a third time  third DUI  fucking loser  so you guys  did you guys  want to fucking  take him out  you know  I just hope he  goes to jail  in some big  fucking  greasy ass  fucking  motherfucker  ramrods  tears his ass  up  over and  over  that would  be good  for him  he's still 
[02:47:00]  not in jail  he's been  in jail  but not  for this  yet  they're  holding him  so he's  been in  jail  until  the court  case is  over  so today  is your  event  what time  are you guys  going to be  there  where is the  event  is it  Javits  Javits  from what  time to  what time  five to  seven  yeah  Roy Nelson  will be  there  Hollis Gracie  or Hollis  Gracie  whatever  Mr. Gracie  I'm worried  about him  too  all kinds 
[02:47:30]  of fools  the Chris  rock of  comedy  of like  MMA  they all  have  90 fucking  shut up  all right  nice talking  to you  fuck yourself  about to  attack you  fucking  childhood  stepdad  used to  say  shut up  for no  reason  I was like  it brought  you back  Bobby  it looks  just like  Billy  Manchin  did too  with that  fucking  1978  mustache  in your  mouth  he didn't  rate me  he beat  me  we should 
[02:48:00]  take a  break  it was  nice meeting  from  Tap Out  Clothing  today  at the  Java  Center  with the  Motorcycle  Convention  go to  tapout.com  check it  out  absolutely  we'll do  that  thanks a lot  guys  thank you  Bob Kelly  in the studio  playing  Bananas  Hasbrook Heights  New Jersey  tonight and  tomorrow  the tap out  guys were  real cool  but during  that interview  I want to 
[02:48:30]  get into it  a little bit  Anthony told  Bobby to  shut up  Bobby turned  around  with a look  like he was  going to  kill  Anthony  because the  shut up  comment went  right back  to Bobby  being a  childhood  well being  picked  what  fuck  what am I  trying to  say  I was  going to  say  being  abused  as a  child  but I'm  not really  sure  what the  fuck  happened  with you  and the  stepdad  it was a  stepdad  thing  it was a  trigger for  you  right  Billy M  that's all  that's right  good old  Billy M  I'm alright  now 
[02:49:00]  but I think  there's two  things  slapped in the  back of the  head  like the  old  what he  used to  do  this is  when I  was in  first  second  third  fourth  sixth  grade  and he's  6'4  big  motherfucker  he was  such a  manly  man  he had  the  fucking  car  with the  t-tops  and he  would like  I remember  the first  month  my mom  was married  to this  guy  he was  fucking 
[02:49:30]  a godsend  he had  money  he had  the t-tops  with the  rims  the Monte  Carlo  he brought  me into  the house  and I  had my  own room  with a  toy box  full of  toys  I had  a bean  bag  with my  own  TV  and I  remember  waking up  one day  I was  on the  bean  bag  watching  TV  it  got dark  out  and I  woke up  all tired  and I  went out  to the  kitchen  and I  opened  the door  and I  see  my  sister  with a  phone cord  wrapped  her on  her neck  crying  my  mother 
[02:50:00]  buckled  over  holding  her  stomach  because  she  just  got  punched  in  the  stomach  everybody  grabbed  they  all  come  and  grab  me  and  then  I  see  the  phone  he  grabbed  the  phone  and  threw  it  at  my  sister's  head  they  all  grabbed  me  going  to  my  room  and  I'm  holding  the  door  as  he's  kicking  it  and  then  he  kicks  his  foot  comes  through  the  door  and  then  he  kicks  it  through  and  I  go 
[02:50:30]  I  was  hurt  more  than  I  was  I  pretended  I  was  knocked  out  I  hit  the  wall  and  slid  down  and  he  came  in  and  you  shut  the  fuck  up  and  then  it  was  five  years  of  that  what  happened  between  this  paradise  of  toys  and  everything  and  what  was  the  reason  he  went  off  that  time  what  dumb  little  stupid  who

[02:54:30]  how old were you  I was in second  grade  I remember I  fell on my bike  that's why I was  late  I went over the  handlebars  I hit a curb  fell on the bike  smashed my teeth  and was coming home  crying and he was  like yeah fucking  late and just  threw me down the  stairs  I wanted to smash  your teeth  you fuck  you ruined my  day  and you're just  a seven year old  right  but it all ended  one day  I grabbed a knife  yeah we know  I snapped  I didn't know  that was the guy  that ended it  what did he do  he backed right 
[02:55:00]  down  was it movie  kind of thing  go ahead  and he didn't  think I was  going to do it  and I just  came right down  and he pulled  his hand back  and then I had  a hatchet  I had a hatchet  in the backyard  hatchet  yeah  so that's  the stupid shit  it fucking  kills me dude  yeah so then  when I called  him stupid  he just looked  at me like  he wanted to  kill me  hey shut up  you said shut up  shut up  he had a fucking  nom flashback  dude I turned around  your eyes were like  pinwheels  dude I saw  it was like 
[02:55:30]  Bobby Boucher  I was like  nobody  mama said  mama said  I say that all the  time to Jimmy  I know  dude I'm so sorry  I love you  I know  I want to know  more about  happy times  bad times  it was just  a fucking  rollercoaster  right  oh it was  so fucking  bad  and then what  after this  horrific scene  and everything  would go back  to normal  and you go  to Mickey D's  or something  oh he was  he would take  me out  he'd fight  with my mom  and my sister  do some  horrendous shit  you know  he used to  bug me about  him too  he used to  take showers  and he parted  his hair  he had that  old school 
[02:56:00]  guy haircut  parted to the  side  short  same fucking  haircut  for five years  okay  same head  same  he used to  use the  barbasol  oh the whole  thing  and he'd get  a face cloth  and dry his  hair  like he'd just  rub it dry  I fucking  hate face cloth  I hate him  I hate him  every one of  these little  details  is just  murder to you  did you and  your sister  talk about  like when he  first did it  did you go  in a room  and just go  what the  fuck happened 
[02:56:30]  that's what  happened  when we  and my sister  that's what  why didn't  the uncle  we separated  she went her  way to survive  and I went  my way  to survive  she started  hanging out  with gays  and lesbians  and fucking  theater people  and I went  over and  is she a lesbian  no she's not  she's not a  lesbian  but I actually  hung out with her  for a minute  because I didn't  have any friends  that's just  when I started  drinking  in 6th grade  when I started  drinking  but before that  I started  hanging out  with her  and I went  over her 
[02:57:00]  the friend's  house  and one of  the fucking  dudes had  a room  of mattresses  because he had  a party  the night  before  I guess  that's how  the gays  do it  they just  fill a room  with mattresses  and fuck  is that how  the gays  do it  that's what  he had  sounds fantastic  he tried to  bang me  but I don't  blame him  I was hot  at that point  I want to ask  you why  the uncles  didn't get  involved  you had five  of them  were they all  scared of Billy  nope  nope  I don't know  I think  you probably 
[02:57:30]  didn't say  anything  to anybody  I think  it's that  fucking  Irish  Catholic  my mom  just  forget about  it  was it  your mom's  brothers  my mom's  brothers  at the end  I remember  she talked  to them  and they  actually  my uncle  Tommy  who's a big  motherfucker  he came over  and fucking  he came over  fucking  gonna fuck  Billy wasn't  a tough guy  his father  was a fucking  animal 
[02:58:00]  his father  had like a  fucking  anchor tattoo  that you know  that guy  would you like  to see Billy  that would  you punch  him  I've seen  him  I saw  him  I was working  at Grossman's  Bargain Outlet  fucking folding  up indoor  outdoor carpet  and he came  in looking  for an  Electrolux  did he know  it was you  did he know  it was you  this weekend  though  fucking close  I know  bananas  a great  clip  I fucking  walked away  dude  really  yeah  this was  when I was  in  I was 18  you know  to get beat  up in a store  how embarrassing  yeah that's true  he probably  would have  punched you  no I heard  he got really

[02:59:00]  how old would  he be now  dude I don't  even know  how old he  was  approximately  like how old  do you think  would he be in  his 60s  like  he's got to be  in his 50s  because my mom  my mom was young  I mean my mom  had my sister  when she was 15  and me when she  was 18  Jesus  okay you're  running to him  now  would you say  anything now  fucking whore  just banging  Vietnam vets  oh fuck  she never wanted  you to pull out  your mother  liked it  she'd say  fill me with

[03:01:30]  shopping  talent  game  it wasn't  originally  the homeless  shopping spree  and they went  to the talent  contest  he doesn't  even know  what he  sponsored  I was there  and I don't  know what I  sponsored  your homeless  lawyers  fucked it up  game  it was very  exciting  so are you  getting a  response  from  we are  getting a  wonderful  response  and I'll  tell you one  thing now  you have some  unbelievable  fans  we probably  got  I would say 
[03:02:00]  upwards of a  thousand emails  and it says  something to the  effect  listen  I don't know  if this shit's  any good  but I'm just  getting it  because you  sponsor ONA  see that  that's what  you want  they're loyal  right  it's very  very nice  it is good  stuff though  it's easy to  say it's good  stuff when it  is  if it wasn't  I probably  wouldn't say  because you're  sponsored  I just  I appreciate  that  what is  a black  diamond  is it  better than  a regular  diamond  or a blue  diamond  no  good question  it's like  an informational  question  explain to us  why  explain to us  how you cook  with this  it is a diamond  that is all 
[03:02:30]  black in color  and it's  just something  different  it's a little  bit more unique  it's just a little  bit unique  but it's  much more abundant  it's not rare  like a blue  or a pink  diamond  would be  and they're  very affordable  Steve Rambajos  is a diamond  that's too lazy  to sparkle  there you go  holy shit  it's a diamond  without a job  god damn  Jimmy what are you  doing  I'm trying to  take a photo  of Bob Kelly's  non-bulge  oh god  you don't have a  bulge Bobby

[03:09:30]  this type of rose  that's called a rose  oh I see  technically called  the technical  explanation  what's it called  the process  because it's like  it's preserved in  24 karat pure gold  but is it outlined  in gold  that one is in  the leaves are  enameled in red  and then it's all  etched and outlined  yes in gold  that is correct  we got a fan that  actually went to your  website  let's go to Tom  in Kansas City  Tom  hey guys  welcome aboard  Tommy  hi Tom  what's going on  today Tom

[03:16:00]  but only if he  needed a smaller  card  like say he had  12 shown  or 13  or say he had  like say  14 shown  7  he would go  7 please  and if he got  a 7 he would  go thank you  but more often  than not  it was  that's not  a 7  why did  you do  that  I do  I yelled  they had to  get a pillow  and bring a

[03:20:00]  whatever it is  let's go  turn it down  I gotta  you have a spot  at the cellar  I gotta work  I'm working  on a piece  for TV  I'll ask my  publicist  I'm not even  kidding man  that's why  Norton's successful  and the rest of us  are fucking floundering  Kobe Bryant  lights up the garden  if they said  hey Kobe  Norton's performing  how about you  give up the game  he'd go  no I got a game  well what's the  difference  dude that's a big  game  he'd go  no he wouldn't  he'd go  who  Kobe Bryant  loves the garden 
[03:20:30]  it's a big game  yeah I don't  that's like  I would love to go  say yes  and then give  the tickets away  don't show up  it looks even better  you look more  Hollywood  when you don't  show up  who's seats  were those  supposed to be  no it was  supposed to be  in a box  nobody would  even notice  yeah they do  give them to  Opie  he would've  loved them  I really  would've loved  them  that game  in particular  I just  turned it down  who invited you  my publicist  from them  talk to the  sports girl  could've  gave them to  her  I didn't think 
[03:21:00]  she'd want to  go plus she  doesn't need me  to go  hot chicks  never need guys  to get tickets  you got a boyfriend  um seeing somebody  so it's brand new  huh  sorta  yeah  you guys texting  each other  yeah  does he hit you  texting things  does he  does he billy  does he billy  em you  oh god  you ever wrap a  phone cord around  you and hit you  in the gut  cause the pasta  was cold  no no  it hasn't yet  who gets to  who gets to  say whether  you get the job  or not  who do you talk 
[03:21:30]  to  who's the boss  Mike Babchick  yeah  do we like that guy  do you know who that is  yeah  he's awesome  you know who that guy is  Mike Babchick  yeah  should we talk to him  for you  yeah  didn't we meet him  on horrible names  dot com  ask a sports question  come on  let's get into this  who do you think  is going to win  the Laker  Knickerbocker  game this evening  the Lakers  for sure  do you think  Kobe will make  a lot of points  I think he'll make 
[03:22:00]  a lot of points  I think his back  is bothering him  how is Kobe's  dribbling in comparison  with some of the  other players  dribbling  should we be ready  for a Shaq attack  we heard Shaq  has a little weenie  yeah I heard Shaq  does not have a big penis  yeah we hear he has  a little one  I mean it would be  huge if it was on  like Sam or something  she's not a shock  shock  she's doing sports  she would have heard  that though  I mean she'd probably  why not  you gotta fill time  with some silly stuff  plus if you do sports  as a woman 
[03:22:30]  you have to go  into the locker room  yeah  have you been  in the locker room  and these guys  are walking around  with this stuff  swinging out  have you seen that  I haven't seen that  no  that wouldn't bug you  though right  you want to right  probably not  Bobby does  and I'm sure you do too  when I went back  to meet the Patriots  and you know  Brady and Belichick  was Belichick  yeah Wes Welker  was standing next to me  with his hog hanging out  and I was just  looking straight  I was just trying  not to look at his hog  you can't see it  if it's in your mouth  oh see 
[03:23:00]  wow  oh come on  you're right  but the  there was a bunch  of girls  you know  journalists  walking around  no big deal  taking  doing interviews  with you know  five dudes  with their  things hanging out  yeah  they're called  penises Bob  yeah but when you  were abused by them  you called them  things  that's true  that's true  that's a good point  big bad monster  yeah so as Bob knows  the throat coders  I liked it  thanks though  alright  I liked it 
[03:23:30]  alright cool  well agreed  any other sports stuff  for this girl  maybe we get her a job  yeah  if you need someone  for sports  do you like MMA  into that  or just regular old  good boy sports  like baseball  football  sports  no I like  you like MMA  do you know what  MMA is  do you like boxing  a little bit  how about golf  not really  good  ping pong  not really  you hear about tiger  I was  play girl  playboy girl of golf  last year  you were  you were  that's me 
[03:24:00]  in the golf scramble  what's your take  on tiger woods  if you were doing  a sports show  I think he's  you know  what  he's ridiculous  why  why  well you're asking  a girl  yeah but you're  in sports  you know all these  guys  you're banging  20 guys  I mean what are they  going to do  you know they all  have groupies  do you think  other athletes cheat  or is this just  an anomaly  I think most of them  do cheat  unfortunately  have any of them  hit on you  they must have  yeah here or there  what uh 
[03:24:30]  what'd you do  before uh  you're trying out  for this  like what  what's your gig  oh I'm a makeup artist  really  yeah  do you smoke  Newports  I don't smoke  at all  she's very healthy  is that how you  met Jimmy  she knows  I drink a lot  of green tea  she's obsessed  with green tea  oh really  and vanilla  you poop  fascinating  salad shooter  yeah and she  likes vanilla  things  what do you mean  that's right  what do you mean  vanilla things  what's a thing  what kind of things  she likes vanilla  like what  just a vanilla stick 
[03:25:00]  I don't know  vanilla beans  what's vanilla things  vanilla perfume  all that  vanilla stuff  so anything vanilla  you like  vanilla  vanilla  so when will you  know about your job  uh well they already  want me to come back  so in two weeks  I'll be doing that  thing outside  and then talking  in the studio again  so it'll be after  right after Super Bowl  are there any women  on that channel  no  so they need you  so it's nice  yeah  they're trying to  come up with a name  for me  that was part of  the uh  conversation today 
[03:25:30]  so I think  Sports Girl is winning  they were going with  like Sports Chick  I would go with  Susie Snooze  nothing with Chick  nice my friend  I don't like that  I was definitely  you know not happy  about that  yeah  so maybe you can  think of something  how about the Sports  Babe  did you hear that one  I think that came out  yeah  I'm sure it was  very nasty  how about uh  sexy  oh Jesus  sexy  sexy  sexy  alright now with the  scores  sexy  yeah 
[03:26:00]  what the fuck  and coming up with  scores  Won't Bang Russo  yeah  you're just fine  thank you  I appreciate that  yeah you got a nice  voice too  thank you  yeah it's very sexy  I really want to do this  yeah people say  it's you know  your voice sounds  very nice over the radio  yeah most  most sports girls  have that tranny voice  alright next  the Lakers  oh what's her name there  Susan Waldman  Susan Waldman  Susan Waldman  oh goodness gracious  most girls can't

[03:27:00]  a little shy  for a sports  girl though  you know  because like  a lot of sports  girls are in your  face  kind of like  I'm very enthusiastic  and passionate  that's why I'm here  they can handle the  callers when they  call you up and  abuse you about  you know  your pics  I'd say we give  her five minutes  right now  why don't you sit  down  we'll put the  headphones on  and we'll do  fucking sports calls  we'll do some sports  calls  what do you think  of Mike Francesa  come on  he's very smart  he's a bore  you know  do you think he's  boring without  Roselle  I'm a mad dog 
[03:27:30]  person  that's why I  listen to  Sirius  that's right  he's a horrible  bore without  he's boring  he's smart  and his pics  are usually  correct but  can I listen  to him for a  long time  does he have  ratings like they  used to have  or no  yeah  I heard his  ratings are really  good  yeah Mikey's  still doing  welcome on a  Sirius satellite  radio because  we need a little  vagina in the  studio  that's my  impression  he does sound  like that right  yeah  look crazy  there's a little  speech impediment
