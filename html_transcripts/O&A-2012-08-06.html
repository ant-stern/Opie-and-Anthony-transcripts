<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, jumping between news events, personal anecdotes, and offensive humor.  The show began with a discussion of the Curiosity rover's successful landing on Mars, contrasting its complexity and the JPL team's elation with the hosts' joking reference to a "Nerd Olympics."  This transitioned into commentary on the London Olympics, focusing heavily on Usain Bolt's 100-meter dash win,  analysis of other events (including criticisms of water polo, handball, and trampoline gymnastics described as "stupid"),  Gabby Douglas's gold medal win (with discussion of her family's financial struggles and a caller, Katrina, expressing racially charged disagreement with the judging), and concluding with a host's personal account of working at Centennial Park during the 1996 Atlanta Olympics bombing and receiving a settlement.

The next segment featured a critique of 37-year-old gymnast Katie Lang’s performance, using derogatory language about her age and appearance.  This led to a conversation with caller Aisha,  who then discussed online “haters,” followed by numerous crude and sexually suggestive jokes about Aisha's boyfriend, Blake's, height and physique.  The bulk of this segment focused on Jim Norton’s Lollapalooza interview with Black Sabbath, detailing his interactions with the band members and Sharon and Kelly Osbourne,  reciting humorous anecdotes from the event,  commenting on Kelly's weight loss, and describing a humorous encounter with a Black woman at the airport.  Technical difficulties during the interview, primarily blamed on the videographer, Sam, were heavily discussed, and Norton recounted Sharon Osbourne's departure from America's Got Talent, connecting it to NBC's handling of Jack Osbourne’s MS diagnosis.  The segment concluded with further blame-casting between Sam and Troy regarding the technical issues.

A post-trip debrief dominated the following segment,  centering on technical malfunctions during a work trip involving Opie, Jim Norton, Sam, and Troy.  Accusations and counter-accusations flew between Troy and Sam, with Norton expressing preference for Troy. E-Rock was heavily criticized for his perceived ineptitude and self-promotion.  The discussion veered into tangents about musicians, Norton's travel preferences, "defaultive" equipment, a planned Chicago broadcast, listener contests (including one for "worst breath"),  a possible Wiener Circle appearance,  and controversies surrounding an NBC Olympics promo featuring monkeys and a skateboard company's shirt with an Asian slur.  The segment ended with commentary on the awkwardness of a Mike Douglas interview with Muhammad Ali and Sly Stone.  Throughout this segment, profanity and personal attacks were frequent.

The final segment opened with a discussion of a Sikh temple shooting, where the hosts speculated on the shooter's motives, expressing anger and using offensive language like "ragheads" and "asshat."  The conversation transitioned to criticisms of field hockey and sexually suggestive comments about athletes in water polo and beach volleyball.  Jokes from Tom Arnold's Roseanne Barr roast and Jeff Ross’s controversial Aurora shooting jokes were shared.  A significant portion detailed one host’s new remote-controlled quadcopter,  including its assembly and potential uses (with comedic tangents about illegal activities).  Louie C.K. was a phone guest, contributing brief humorous interjections, and a listener called in to discuss tri-copters.  The show concluded with promotional announcements for their Chicago live show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  What enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Bravo, right?  Morning. Monday morning.  Ah, yes.  Nice.  I want to know about Mars.  I'm fascinated by Mars.  The engineer that's supposed to be here.  Yeah, Mars takes off because they land a rover on Mars. 
[00:00:30]  God, how dumb is he?  It's his name, yeah.  One of those conspiracies, right?  I love this Mars shit.  Well, you love...  Fucking fantastic.  You love space shit.  I like space. I like science. I like innovation.  I like when America and NASA and Jet Propulsion Laboratories do something that works.  Is this a NASA mission?  Well, NASA kind of does the launch and everything at Jet Propulsion Laboratories, puts the thing together, plans the mission. 
[00:01:00]  And are these actual pictures, new pictures coming in right now?  Where's that one from?  2001?  Yeah, 2001.  Oh, 2001.  That's a while ago. Wow, that's a pretty good picture.  Oh, so we've already done this shit.  Eh, to some extent, this has got much bigger...  This is a much bigger rover.  Curiosity.  Why are they calling it Curiosity?  Because he's very curious.  A little strange.  He's very curious.  A little guy. 
[00:01:30]  He's a big guy.  Curiosity.  About a ton.  This one, the other rovers were little things, like little RC-sized things.  Right.  And these are, this one's like the size of a car, a small car, and it weighs about a ton.  Well, my first question, as time goes by, we make things very, you know, smaller and lighter, so why is this one heavier?  I think it's easier to get over the terrain when it's bigger like that.  You can fit more shit in it to do more experiments.  It's nuclear-powered, so you don't need to depend on solar panels as much and the weather and shit like that. 
[00:02:00]  But getting it there was the most amazing fucking thing ever that I've ever seen.  The capsule comes off, and it's, you know, shaped like your standard capsule-looking thing, kind of a cone-shape-y thing.  And it starts coming through the atmosphere.  And then the cone thing kind of loses the heat shield, and a parachute comes out first, you know, slows it down a lot. 
[00:02:30]  And then rockets fire, and this sky crane comes out and fucking holds the rover up with rocket engines.  And then it slowly lowers it down to Mars, and then cables come out, and it actually unwinds the cables and lowers this rover down on the fucking surface.  And then the rocket part kind of just takes back off again and crashes somewhere else.  But they've got cameras on that, too, to show it touching down on Mars. 
[00:03:00]  How the hell do they figure that out?  And how the hell?  Yeah, there it is.  To put it exactly where they want.  And how the hell do they test it?  Yeah.  There's really...  I don't even know how they go about testing something like that, making sure it'll work.  You think a lot of guys stopped breathing yesterday?  Yes.  Going, okay, here we go.  Well, that was better work.  That was what was going on.  If you watched inside Jet Propulsion Laboratories, their whole mission control area, they lost their fucking minds when they got confirmation that this landed wheels down and everything. 
[00:03:30]  There was one guy in there with a mohawk.  I guess he's like the fucking crazy guy.  Oh, shit.  But they all just start cheering like maniacs and crying, I guess, with all the years that go into these missions, planning it and building it, and then eight and some odd months to get there.  And then sometimes it just crashes and you get nothing.  There's a lot of money and time wasted.  But it actually worked.  When did it land?  About 1 a.m. Eastern. 
[00:04:00]  So only a few hours ago at this point, huh?  Yeah, they sent a couple of low-res pictures because it takes a while to get the high-gain antenna up where they could start beaming some really quality shit back to Earth.  And they got to test out all the systems.  But they got a few pictures of, you know, they show a wheel and it's on the ground and every indication is it's working.  Yeah, there's everybody.  Freaking out.  There's a room full of white people just freaking out.  So what?  They won a gold medal? 
[00:04:30]  Well, what's going on?  I'm confused.  No, they didn't win a gold medal.  Is this part of the Olympics?  Is this the Nerd Olympics?  That is the Nerd fucking Olympics.  There's the Nerd Olympics right there.  They got a gold medal.  Gold medal in the Nerd Olympics.  So much better than badminton.  Badminton.  I'd rather watch this than a badminton match.  See a lot of Asians.  In there?  That math.  Oh, boy.  Well, that math will get you places.  You've got to have your numbers right when you're doing that shit. 
[00:05:00]  You think?  Oh, man.  Your calculations have to be perfect.  They've had missions where, I mean, billion dollar missions that were completely fucked up and crashed because they didn't convert.  They didn't carry the metric.  They didn't carry the one.  They had a decimal off.  Yeah, things have happened in the past.  And there's so many people that are supposed to check that.  And it just slips through the cracks and, bam, they wonder why it fucking drilled itself into a planet or an asteroid.  What are they going to do with it on Mars? 
[00:05:30]  What are they looking for?  There's nothing there.  Well, they're driving it around and they're going to look for some of the earliest building blocks of life.  See if any of that shit's laying around.  Didn't we try this already, though?  So what's different this time?  Yeah, but you've got better experiments on board.  You could look for more details.  They're going to dig a little deeper?  Dig a little deeper.  A little deeper this time around?  They're going to drill into the ground and take a core sample of some rock.  Imagine there's some amazing shit just a mere 20 feet below the surface. 
[00:06:00]  And they can't get there.  Kind of like our old ruins where somebody's walking through a forest one day and kicks a rock and goes,  Oh, what's this rock?  And they start digging.  And it's like, Holy shit, it's a whole city.  Finds a hood ornament or something.  And it just gives them a better opportunity, better experiments.  All on board, which is amazing, too.  Because, I mean, this has to go from picking up a sample to actually analyzing it.  And everything is a moving fucking part. 
[00:06:30]  You know, everything is something that can break.  Right.  So just the fact that it got there is amazing enough.  And how far is it going to move around?  I'm not sure.  It's on a two-year mission.  But those little rovers were only supposed to last about a year.  And I think one of them are still rolling.  Just rolling?  Yeah, they just figured, eh, let them go.  Really?  Until the power runs out.  Are they still getting pictures from that?  Yeah, they still get information.  You think they're finally bored?  Like, oh, God, this desert will never end. 
[00:07:00]  When are we going to start seeing some trees?  Some buildings.  Trees, yeah.  Something.  Anything else.  This was exciting at first, but fuck.  Yeah, that's cool, though.  I like this shit.  This is a much bigger rover.  So they will be able to cover more ground and cover, like, rougher terrain.  Because you get a big rock in front of that other rover.  It's got a turn and kind of a pain in the ass.  Well, did they decide?  They obviously landed somewhere differently on the planet.  Yeah, in a crater. 
[00:07:30]  Why in a crater?  I guess they wanted to get down.  Instead of digging deep, you can just go into a crater, and that gives you that much  more into the planet that you're getting through.  Gotcha.  So they popped it in there, which another amazing thing is being able to put it where  the fuck you want.  Are they going to bring some of this shit back?  Nah.  Can't really do that.  That's it.  Whatever we put on there is done.  Oh, yeah.  What am I talking about?  But if there is anybody on Mars, they'd be like, why do you keep doing this shit? 
[00:08:00]  Really?  What is this trash you're sending?  Oh, cool.  More toys for us.  What is it?  What is it?  It would kind of be cool if they could bring something back.  And I'm sure they could.  Technically, I bet they can figure out how to launch a little return vessel from the  surface.  Probably be a piece of dust that just destroys the Earth.  Just kills us.  A nice sci-fi movie.  The Andromeda Strain.  Just a dumb sci-fi movie.  Turns your blood to powder.  Right.  One dumb piece of dust from Mars.  Yeah.  And that's what takes us out in the end. 
[00:08:30]  Did we talk about moon rocks when Ben came in here?  Oh, yeah, we did.  Moon rocks.  It's illegal to own them.  Yeah, yeah.  But if people do, they got them stolen.  A Mars rock would be very valuable.  Yeah, I got one.  It's kind of fun to have around the house.  They're really heavy, though.  It's from Mars.  You looking to palm this or sell it?  Yeah.  Well, you know, it's just a rock.  We've got to put it in a plexiglass case, son.  It's going to take a lot to sell.  If this is an actual Mars rock, the price could go through the roof. 
[00:09:00]  Anthony wants less taxes, but will support a space exploration.  Yep.  Exactly.  Exactly.  But at least you know your taxes are going towards something really cool.  Let me tell you something.  The innovation that we use on a daily basis from the byproduct of the space program is  worth it ten times.  Tenfold.  Tenfold.  Tenfold what we've invested as taxpayers. 
[00:09:30]  It's something that pays dividends back.  Not like these fuck dick programs that I'm paying for that do nothing but support lazy people.  Teach a man to fish and he'll go to space or something.  I don't know.  I think if my taxes went toward cool stuff, I wouldn't mind as much.  Exactly.  I wouldn't mind.  Where are we going next with my tax dollars?  We learn things.  Yeah, so...  Space program, you dummy.  Why the fuck can't they figure out the time thing better so this could be a primetime landing? 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, yeah, that's...  Nah, but...  I guess it's got to...  After all these years of planning, can't they look at a fucking clock and go, okay, if we...  All right, we could get this down at ten, ten o'clock at night on a Sunday.  That'd be nice.  I don't think they care.  That would be some good viewing right there.  I don't think they really care about a primetime.  These nerds don't care?  Well, they should.  I think they care about the mission and the optimum time that they need to do this kind of thing.  Do you understand we're landing something on Mars and they go, oh, let's just do it in the middle of the night? 
[00:10:30]  Are you kidding me?  I'm sure it's when they kind of had to do it.  It should be done right this second.  Huh?  I'm sure they kind of had to do it at that time.  Wow, the solar winds were...  Well, in order to even get there, they use planets to propel the ship.  They don't just launch it and then, you know...  I don't get it.  And they have to launch it at a certain time because it's eight months from the time they launch it.  Mars has to be closer than it was when they launched it.  Right.  So you can't just launch something and then chase Mars down. 
[00:11:00]  And then you've got to...  All the planets have got to be in a certain area where you have to deal with the flight path that this thing is taking  and then use another planet to kind of pull it with the gravity.  And then at the last minute, they kind of use a little steering rocket to pull away.  But that gravity that pulled you toward the planet then slingshots you faster than Mars.  What if it's your job to do the slingshotting and you got distracted?  You wanted to check your Twitter or something and you forgot to push the button. 
[00:11:30]  Well, I think it's all automated at that point.  Is it?  Yeah.  Well, they do have to send signals, but I don't think it's like you'd be on Facebook and go,  Oh, shit, I got to kind of press that button.  But how do they figure this shit out?  I don't know.  It's fucking amazing.  It's fucking amazing.  When you want to drive to another city, you have a tough time just finding the best route.  Yeah.  And these nerds are figuring this shit out.  Nerds can figure out how to use the planet's gravity to fucking propel a ship to another planet.  That's unbelievable.  It's amazing.  It really is. 
[00:12:00]  All right.  Yeah, very cool.  I was very excited to hear that they had landed it.  Obi wants to sync up the time from Mars, but we can't do it from London.  Oh, well.  Well, the Olympics, you know.  Can't do it in the middle of the fucking, well, it would be very early morning, wouldn't  it?  But the Olympics should be on our time.  I don't give a fuck what nation has them.  It should be on our time.  Always.  True.  I'll leave four o'clock in the morning, whatever it was, so it can be watched here. 
[00:12:30]  There you go.  See?  Four in the morning, you're going to an event.  Well, I hear it's not affecting the ratings much.  People are really watching this.  That's what I hear.  You know what?  As much as there's Twitter and Facebook and all this shit, when I watch a night, I really  don't know the results.  I don't either.  I'm really bad.  I just kind of watch for a little while.  I've been avoiding the trending topics.  If you see Usain Bolt or whatever, you know he won.  So I've been trying to avoid that, and it's been pretty good. 
[00:13:00]  I watched poor little Michaela fall on her ass.  I didn't know she was going to do that.  Did you?  No, I did not know she was going to do that.  I guess I stayed clear of the spoilers.  Yeah, now that we're admitting this, we'll get fucked for the last week of the Olympics.  Yeah.  These assholes out there will now find better ways to fuck us over.  But I don't care if I know.  Yeah, it doesn't matter in general, I guess.  Like, if I know something, I might be more apt to tune in.  Right.  And not miss something, but, yeah.  Well, you got Usain Bolt.  Is that how you say his first name, Usain?  Usain Bolt, I think.  Yeah, Usain Bolt is ridiculous. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  He had a horrible start, and he ends up winning the gold anyway.  I was watching videos of him.  I got into a weird YouTube loop, and I just started watching Usain Bolt running videos.  He's amazing.  Jesus, man.  He really is fucking awesome.  I remember him from the last Olympics.  This guy is amazing.  It's ridiculous how fast this guy is.  And he don't give a shit.  He admitted he was eating McDonald's before the race and stuff.  Like, look at these fights.  It's an official sponsor of the Olympics.  And he had a horrible start.  You can't come from behind in the 100-meter dash. 
[00:14:00]  Gosh, that's almost impossible.  Yeah.  But he did it.  He kicked everyone's ass.  He dood it.  He, what, got the Olympic record, I think?  But not the world record?  Oh, is that it?  I believe so, yes.  But he has the world record.  He just didn't beat his world record.  Oh, so he's got the world record anyway?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I believe so.  That's a fast-positive.  Fast-motor-fucker.  ...races, and this one is one of the best.  Featuring...  I wouldn't say that.  ...the four fastest men in history. 
[00:14:30]  Usain Bolt, Tyson Gay, Asafa Pal, and Johan Blake.  And Usain Bolt looking to become only the second man behind Carl Lewis to win...  Well, this video is almost four minutes long, and the race is less than ten seconds, so  I assume we're going to have some filler here.  He's still all dressed in their shit.  I know, man.  Do we really need all this shit?  Their baggy shit.  Has he lost the step?  Wow, man.  And will he be vulnerable?  I watched a Letterman interview with him, too, last night.  An old Letterman interview from a couple years ago. 
[00:15:00]  Letterman's a good interviewer, man.  Like, Usain Bolt is just not a...  He seems like a nice enough man, but he's not a good...  He's nervous.  I don't think he can really talk that way.  Well, he...  No, no, he speaks probably English, but...  No, about, like, what's he going to talk about?  He's a runner.  Yeah, he was just kind of like, no, no, it's fine.  It's great.  It's great.  You know, he's just...  Oof.  He's pretty cocky, though, man.  As a runner, yeah.  He's got a lot of confidence.  I bet he's cocky.  I don't know.  He's got a big cock.  Hey, he's Jamaican in 6'4"?  Ten and a half.  You think?  Oh, my...  His time would be probably half of what it is was the first cock. 
[00:15:30]  How the fuck do you run if you've got a big cock?  You're going to strap that thing down.  Yeah, that's what's slowing him down, believe me.  I would just panic when the gunshot happened and fall on my face.  Like one of those little fucking...  One of those...  The goats that faint.  Jimmy's a fainting goat.  They don't...  I think they don't allow false starts anymore.  I think you're disqualified.  Really?  Yeah, they...  Look, he's way behind.  Usain Bolt trying to come along. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  And then he just destroys the field.  Here's Bolt.  Usain Bolt explodes.  And he's still...  Literally, he exploded.  Wow, I've never seen that.  He blew up on the track.  Oh.  When you only have to take 41 steps...  And everyone else...  Look at this.  He's in sixth place right there.  Usain Bolt simply has less work to do to complete...  Oh, yeah.  He is because he's so much taller than that.  Right.  Is he 6'4"?  6'4". 
[00:16:30]  And I didn't realize it broke down to 41 steps compared to 44 steps.  41 steps.  For the other little legs.  All the other little legs.  Wow.  That's fucking fast.  You see that?  He's watching a top view now.  Wow.  If he just ran into a wall, he'd kill himself, of course.  That's fast.  I don't know why you would.  Yeah.  And they run with necklaces on.  Would you take all that shit off? 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, I would...  It looks like an action figure arm.  Yeah, he's...  He's in perfect physical condition.  So is Phelps.  All these guys are just humiliating.  Yeah.  Once again, by Usain Bolt...  Yeah, the Olympics is humiliating.  You think?  Yeah.  Until you see some of the bruisers playing water polo.  Yeah, well...  And not so much.  No.  We have a bruiser on the water polo team.  A monster.  She's a fucking...  A sea monster.  It really is disturbing to watch her, man. 
[00:17:30]  She's Cloverfield.  Oh, yeah.  Just a big, fat ass.  She doesn't even look like a woman.  You like water polo?  It's kind of stupid.  No, it's...  Like I said, I can't take when they throw and miss, and then everybody does a whoosh,  whooshy, whooshy, swim to the other side of the pool.  It's not quite like watching hockey when they, you know...  Right.  ...go on the other end of the ice.  Every time we bring it up that it's stupid, people get really mad.  Yeah.  But I think it's stupid, because we don't really watch it any other time. 
[00:18:00]  No.  No, not at all.  Like, hefty sports, if you're not watching it when the Olympics aren't happening, obviously  it's just a dumb sport.  Yeah.  You see that handball?  They have handball?  I didn't see it.  Well, they run up the court with a ball, and it's soccer, but you use your hands.  What?  It's water polo out of the water.  It's...  I did not see that sport.  You haven't seen handball?  No sport.  No.  And they're trying to say this one woman is the best at it.  It's like, how would you know?  It's almost...  Yeah.  And who gives a shit about her? 
[00:18:30]  It's almost like dodgeball.  It's really strange.  You really haven't seen handball?  No, look at that.  They don't really show it much.  Is it called handball?  I think so.  Is it called handball?  There, Sam.  Yeah.  Yeah, men's group A, Argentina versus Tunisia.  I guess Tunisia's really good at handball.  It's another stupid fucking sport.  Which one?  It's another stupid fucking thing, like the trampoline.  Well, the trampoline shit we did Friday had me howling.  Oh. 
[00:19:00]  Jimmy, they got the trampoline in the Olympics.  And we were watching these routines, I guess, and they were exactly the same.  Yeah, it's the same thing.  Because there's not much you can do on a trampoline after a while.  No, you bounce real high, you bounce on your ass, you make an L with yourself, you spin  around.  Right.  It's ridiculous.  I don't get it.  Yeah.  At least the swimming is finally over, right?  I think the swimming's done.  The diving's done.  Those Chinese are good at the diving. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, well, they don't make much of a splash in life and diving.  And I just, all weekend long, I was just noticing Japanese guys' hair.  Yeah.  Their hairstyles are just, they do not like the standard straight black hair.  No, they do shit with their hair.  It's amazing.  That's what makes them different over all the other Asian countries.  I straight black hair do not like.  Do not like not attractive to a female. 
[00:20:00]  That's why I went to a hairdresser.  Got new American hairstyle.  Look like a kid rock.  Every one I was looking at was something different.  They like to bleach some of it blonde there.  I bleach blonde hair sometime.  Want nice big hair with a lot of body. 
[00:20:30]  No want straight frat hair.  When try to get American girlfriend.  Now look, look like a singer from the Akasha Gugu.  It was everyone I was looking at was a little spiky top.  Look like a Bay City roller.  Yeah, it's from another time. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  They're doing stuff with their hair, but it's from another time.  Yeah, but it's like from the 80s or something.  80s, some of that 60s stuff.  I don't get girlfriend.  Look for girlfriend when I go out.  So I dye hair blonde.  Get a hairstyle.  Now look like a Rod Stewart.  This is handball, by the way, in the background.  Look at this dumb sport. 
[00:21:30]  Do you dribble the ball?  Do you just run down the court with it?  Is it called a court?  Is it a field?  What is this?  It's pretty easy to just run down the court and throw it into a goal.  I would assume these people started out as like soccer guys.  They realized they weren't good with their feet.  They couldn't kick the ball around.  They were like, all right, why don't you try water polo?  And then they couldn't stay afloat.  So they're like, all right, why don't you just fucking play this weird handball sport?  This is like something you played when the gym teacher was out.  Right. 
[00:22:00]  Like when there's a substitute gym teacher and they just kind of were like, ah.  When they brought out that weird shit.  Yeah.  We're just going to play this.  Did you have one of those big giant balls that you would just roll around the gym?  They were bigger than all the students.  Yeah, yeah.  But they only broke that out when the substitute came in.  When the substitute was there, he didn't really give a shit.  Did you have the big stupid parachute thing?  The parachute.  They didn't break that out if it was a regular gym teacher.  What was that all about anyway?  You're just flinking a parachute getting air underneath it and looking like, ooh, look. 
[00:22:30]  So you had one of those?  Yeah.  So every school had one of those?  I guess so.  Why?  I don't know what that did.  I guess this guy scored in handball.  The team's dressed like refs.  Yeah.  And that's it.  I don't know.  It's kind of stupid.  Why is this an Olympic sport but baseball and softball isn't anymore?  That old gag, I get it, but there's a lot of weird sports in there.  I like that snotty face on that Mikayla girl, though. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  She slipped.  She's just got a vault once.  Just vaulted.  And years of preparation.  Here's your moment.  And she slipped and fell right on her ass on her little...  It just goes to show you, it's not worth all that time and effort.  Because in the end...  It comes down to...  Anything could happen.  There's got to be an element of luck there, huh?  You think?  Yeah, I would think.  You know, we nailed the Gabby Douglas thing. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, man, did we ever.  Holy fuck are we good at predicting shit.  We were talking about how Gabby Douglas won the gold.  And I just want to interrupt for a second.  We could tell by seeing her mom and her other sisters in the audience,  we're like, oh, shit, she's in trouble.  Oh, boy.  Because with all the endorsement money and stuff,  you've got to assume she's got to take care of the family.  Yeah.  And then it comes out Gabby Douglas' mom is filing for bankruptcy.  She broke-ass broke, motherfucker. 
[00:24:00]  But you could kind of see how they were all acting in the stands  that something wasn't right.  And she lives with, what, a lily white family in Iowa to train?  She should go back to that family, I'm thinking.  They sent her off to a family in Iowa to train and live with them,  and she wound up, you know, you listen to her talk,  there's not a hint of gangster in it.  Right.  And she's achieved greatness,  and now this broke-ass mom is just going to milk the shit out of her 
[00:24:30]  fucking everything.  We know how this is going to end.  We know.  We know how this is going to end.  Oh, this is going to be bad.  We're going to have to wait a few years,  but we already know how this is going to end.  Keep that name in mind when it pops up in the news.  About three, four years from now.  Entertainment magazines.  What happened to America's sweetheart, Gabby Douglas?  Oh, my God.  She's just going to be like,  my mama took all my shit.  You'll be all fucking just sitting there in D.C. 
[00:25:00]  My mom took all my shit.  I ain't got nothing left.  Dreaming of what could have been if she stayed in Iowa  with the Lily White family.  Yeah, I want to go.  I want to go.  You think some of that ghetto's going to come back?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It'll just come back.  Oh, no.  The mother's going to be like,  she have to do for me.  I was broke.  Well, my mama took everything.  Oh, man.  But I got these pictures.  Let's just show pictures of her show.  I don't have the gold medals anymore. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Lost those years ago.  It's like, well, Gabby,  let's look at a video of you at the London Olympics.  And she'll be like, mm-hmm.  And then they'll show her, and she's like,  well, it was very nice.  I'm so glad I won.  I'm very proud to have won this for my country.  Yeah, I was proud.  I was prouder than a motherfucker.  Oh, that poor kid.  She only has pictures of the gold medals. 
[00:26:00]  Just pictures of them.  Oh, whatever.  How many she went?  One, two?  I don't know.  My mama took it down to fucking Vegas,  and they pawned that shit.  He gave us like $15 for it.  Said he'd have to frame it or some shit.  But we got dinner that night.  Yeah.  We ate that night.  Maybe it won't happen.  Maybe not.  It's not a good sign, though,  that the mom's filing for bankruptcy.  Why does this shitty paper have to even put that?  Gabby's gold in nick of time for her broke mom.  What does it have to do with her? 
[00:26:30]  Her broke-ass mom is what they wanted her right.  Broke-ass mom.  Why are they showing the Olympian with her arms spread?  And then her fucking fat mom waving from the stands.  Because it's one of those stories that you know what's going to happen.  And we called it before this info came out.  Oh, you know it.  Just something wasn't right with the mom and the sisters.  The sisters are bigger gals.  Same father?  I don't know.  Because the sisters are bigger.  They are, but she...  Oh.  Yeah, they are. 
[00:27:00]  Did you see the interview where it's the real mom and then the Iowa parents?  Oh, no.  Because Gabby kind of looks at the Lily White family as sort of like her family.  Right.  She's been living with them for a while.  Yeah.  And they're like really politely just kind of in the background, not pushing things.  Oh, God.  Oh.  As the mom's getting the spotlight for being the mom of Gabby Douglas.  I taught her everything.  I taught her how to tumble.  And the white family's like, oh, God.  Oh, boy.  But the white family doesn't know.  The white family is just talking to other white... 
[00:27:30]  They think everyone has a black athlete in it.  The white families are saying to other white people, which one is yours?  That one's ours.  Which one is yours?  Oh, man.  When I was growing up, we had a black in our family.  You did?  Yeah, but she didn't do nothing.  She didn't tumble or any of this crap.  We just took her to Jones Beach.  You need someone that's going to tumble.  That was a good one.  That was a good one.  That was a good one. 
[00:28:00]  You got to think the Lily White...  I'm going to keep saying Lily White family from Iowa.  Lily White.  The mom's saying she taught her how to tumble.  Well, we took out a second mortgage on our home so she could get that coach.  Mom's broke.  Mom's all broke.  Wow.  She's really good.  She was the best, I guess, but she blew it when it mattered.  Did she?  Yeah, last night.  No, not Gabby.  No, Michaela we're looking at.  No, I mean Gabby.  The black girl on Fox.  Oh, I thought you were looking at the computer screen.  I'm sorry.  I haven't seen her. 
[00:28:30]  No, Gabby's ridiculous.  She's really...  Gymnast mom in debt.  Wow.  Based on foreclosure.  Oh, boy.  That's the story now.  That's the story.  Why are they even showing that?  I mean, I understand.  But who gives a fuck?  Yeah.  We all like her.  Let her just enjoy her fucking...  In America, we love bringing people up and then fucking destroying them.  So I'm sure there's a lot of people that are very excited out there.  Because a lot of the endorsing money is going to go right to the mom's problems.  Oh, God.  Holy fuck. 
[00:29:00]  Gabby, you have to help us.  You better make another Wheaties commercial.  And then she's got to watch her mom walking around with like,  Well, I needed this jury.  I needed new jury to get me a job.  I can't be walking around as Gabby's mom without jury.  Now, you're my chow, and I need jury.  And I got to get my her did.  Oh, man.  She's going to benefit way more than Gabby. 
[00:29:30]  Mama took all my shit.  Is there any way we can put money in a bank for her or something?  Do we save her?  What do we do?  A trust fund something.  What can we do for her?  She's 16, man.  I don't think it's like entertainment industry where the parents aren't allowed to take their cash.  Right.  Maybe it is.  I don't know if you can take the cash or not.  I don't know.  I imagine it's hard to get somebody's cash in their 16.  That's my chow.  It's my money, motherfucker.  Yeah, I don't know. 
[00:30:00]  I don't know.  No, there's going to be a workaround.  Yeah, there'll be a workaround.  She's got another Olympics in her, though.  I need a mani-pedi.  I need a mani-pedi.  Oh, man.  She's going to be fucking just going to the Olympics until she's 50, trying to pay off her mom's debt.  Coming in 17th place.  She's an older woman.  Oh, man.  We got Katrina from Long Island.  I was a gymnast, and Gabby Douglas should not have won.  Oh, no.  Let's hear this. 
[00:30:30]  Katrina, why?  Katrina, why?  Because she's black, right?  Yes.  Because she's black.  Is it a black thing?  What's going on here?  Sounds like sour grapes to me.  I think Victoria from the Russian team should have won.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  I said all this.  Victoria from the Russian team did a better job, I think.  They did.  They should have been in the gold and silver, and Gabby should have been in the bronze.  But, again, the scoring system, if you look at the point values and the start values and everything,  and if you just go on a blog for the gymnastics community, I'm not the only one saying that. 
[00:31:00]  So you didn't want to see a black woman win the gold, so now you're obsessing about the fact that she didn't win?  No, Dominique Dawes could put her in the ground.  I don't know if you guys know her.  No, she can't.  She's very old now.  She can't do shit.  And how far did you get with your gymnast before you got really bitter?  Oh, I blew out my knees.  But I'm not bitter.  Trust me.  I'm a coach now, but let me just tell you something.  The scoring system was just a little bit partial.  If you go back and look at the start values and look at the rules. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, boy.  I don't know what that means, the start values.  When you throw a stunt, it's going to be, I'm trying to put it in the smaller terms,  but you're setting out a goal of what the trick is going to be,  and you're telling the judges ahead of time.  And let's say you don't throw it fully, you're still going to get that value  if you're within that frame of qualification.  But, again, strategically, she put out all these things where it was going to be 
[00:32:00]  a higher star value, and the Russians played it a little bit more safer,  but they executed a lot better.  If you look, five times out of ten, Gabby was outside of the box,  and Gabby couldn't stick her landing.  No.  But the point system, and again, the judges kind of catered it there  because they knew it was going to be America's sweetheart kind of situation  and that the endorsements would be flying.  I'm telling you.  They don't care, though.  Those judges don't give a shit.  They're all foreigners, anyway. 
[00:32:30]  Aren't they from different places, madam?  Olympic judges, how many times, I mean, you guys were talking about it last time,  like, you know, oh, isn't that interesting how, oh, there's a ruling,  the Chinese coach is coming over with a fistful of cash, you know.  So there's stuff that gets thrown, but.  I don't know.  Well, yeah, I don't know.  I mean, the whole.  But it just happens to fall in that Michelle Obama.  You don't have to sell me.  It happens to fall into a certain way.  I like this girl.  All right, Katrina.  Are you a little fire plug?  Do you look like a fire hydrant now?  Old gymnasts, they don't age well. 
[00:33:00]  They just.  Yeah.  I'm in very good shape.  I bet you are, but.  I'm in five foot four.  I have.  Giant shoulders.  Yeah.  Big calves.  No more.  No, four to five percent body fat still.  Forty five percent.  All right.  All right.  You Long Island racist.  You think she's upset with the black horse.  Of course I do.  How old are you, Hitler?  You can smell it, right?  Oh, sure.  You can smell it.  I can see it coming. 
[00:33:30]  My racist radar is amazing.  She's on the blog still discussing it.  It happened a week ago.  Relax.  I think that Russian chick did a better job, as a matter of fact, sticking the landings  and just generally looked a little cleaner than, not literally, you know, figuratively.  If you look at the Russians, they're.  All right.  You said it right.  Was it close, though, and it was really close, right?  It was very close.  It came down to the floor routine, and I think Victoria pulled it off a little better than  old Gabby did.  Well, you know what?  I'll give it to Gabby because not only is she an American, but she didn't have, like, 
[00:34:00]  computer technology shot into her like those cheating Soviets.  It was probably a 35-year-old man in a teenage girl outfit.  Fuck the Soviets.  Give it to Gabby.  She's just a chick who went to Ohio.  She didn't have the entire government behind her, like, fuck it, they do in Moscow.  Oh, there you go.  Nobody eats, but she's spin good.  I wish I did better accents.  That's pretty good.  That is good.  All right, Katrina.  Thank you.  Goodbye, Katrina.  Katrina hates that she's a white girl with a black girl name. 
[00:34:30]  That's what they're torturing her.  She's probably proud of her name, though, what it did down in Louisiana.  Do you know how many times she shows up somewhere and they go, oh, we thought you were, and  she goes, I know, I know.  We missed the obvious with Gabby's mom.  I got to go to this phone call.  I have to.  We should have nailed this one ourselves.  Dave in Indiana.  Go ahead, Dave.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The gold medal that's going to end up is gold tea.  A grail.  Hey, where's Gabby's gold medal? 
[00:35:00]  My mama used it to make a grail.  They melt that shit down.  It's in her teeth.  It's in her two-faces.  Oh, man.  Oh, poor Gabby.  Oh, she's America's sweetheart right now.  It could be kind of fun to watch, though.  What happens now?  It could be kind of fun.  Watch the whole thing crumble.  We love a good pedestal crumbling, don't we?  I'm secretly hoping she just says, fuck mama, I'm going back to Iowa. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, go back to Iowa, please.  That's what I actually am rooting for.  Yeah.  I really am.  I never saw the parents, the white parents.  They are as lily white as possible, very soft-spoken, very proud of her.  At this point, they really feel like it's her daughter.  It's the daughter.  Because she's been living with the family for a while now.  I'm not sure how long someone else will know that.  Oh, my God.  And it's like they've got to fucking give her up.  I think they're sort of bummed that they might be losing her soon.  Let me see.  Gabby Douglas, other mom. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, here we go.  Those are the two of them sitting together.  Gabby Douglas, the other mom, Missy Parton.  I got the feeling that they don't totally get along.  They're polite to each other.  Fuck.  Who's these?  Hold on a minute.  Gabby is, yeah, Gabby is, obviously, you know, she got a good education.  Very well-spoken.  How'd she get out to Ohio?  Very polite.  How'd that work?  Iowa, Iowa.  Iowa, how, like. 
[00:36:30]  There must be some kind of a program where underprivileged children can go to.  Well, the gymnast?  And when they realize someone is really talented, they want to get the best out of her.  This is incredible gold medal performance possible.  Her own mother and the Iowa mom who took her in.  Who's that fucking blonde on the right?  Train with the top coach.  Is that her sister?  Olympic gold medalist and GMA Olympic contributor and ESPN analyst Julie Fowdy.  Light with the credits.  Exactly.  Two remarkable moms.  Just get to the story.  Here's this chick.  This morning, Gabby Douglas is not only the first U.S. gymnast to win both the all-around title 
[00:37:00]  and the team gold during the same Olympics.  She's the first African-American all-around champion in Olympic history.  I said, we're still keeping track of that shit?  Do you believe it yet?  Has it sunk in?  And she said, no.  Are they different?  It all started when Gabby was just 14, a little girl from Virginia Beach with a far-off  Olympic dream.  Two years of 14?  A dream that would require great sacrifice.  You usually go with six years old.  I really need to have a change, you know, in my coaching.  And she said, and I want Liang Chow. 
[00:37:30]  Liang Chow coached Sean Johnson to an Olympic gold, but he lives 20 hours away in Des Moines,  Iowa.  Wow.  Forcing Gabby's mom, Natalie Hawkins, to make the hardest decision of her life.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  She said, well, I'll go by myself.  Do you understand what you're saying?  But the move was made easier thanks to Missy Parton, who not only agreed to have Gabby live  with her, but welcomed her as one of her own daughters.  She went from being the baby in her house to being the oldest in my house. 
[00:38:00]  And it took her a little time to kind of get used to that.  I relied on Missy a lot during that time.  I would call her a lot and say, how's she doing?  You think she's looking for the payback?  I need some money.  Both who helped shape an Olympian.  At times, I was like, hey, wait a minute, whose kid is this?  Here's your mind.  Oh, boy.  I would just fall in love with her right away.  As the 16-year-old accepted the gold and the most coveted title in women's gymnastics,  all-around champion.  Douglas led from the start Thursday and never looked back. 
[00:38:30]  It was a moment both overwhelming and awe-inspiring for Gabby Douglas.  Her routine was beautifully executed with perfect lines and amazing leaps.  Super high.  She made history on several different levels.  This piece is boring.  It makes me think that, you know, the sky's the limit.  Together, they braised an Olympian.  Oh, the sky's the limit.  Why doesn't the agent, the guy who knew the coach, move to New York or somewhere where people can take your shit?  Stupid.  He's 20 hours away in Iowa. 
[00:39:00]  It's not motivated.  No.  That's a shitty business.  It's terrible.  You've got to come to me.  Grab the gold medal in the all-around.  You almost don't have words.  We stand back and are completely amazed by her.  At least they're going to duke it out at some point.  Julie Fowdy, ABC News London.  You just know.  They're going to duke it out.  Like, it's all nice right now, but you just know there's going to be problems.  This is fucking United States and Russia standing in Germany.  Right.  Hey, look what we did together.  And then, whoa.  Although, the white mom has fallen in love with her. 
[00:39:30]  Yes.  Like, she's her daughter now, so you've got that going on.  Then you've got the real mom, the biological mom, that's absolutely looking for her fucking piece of the pie.  She broke.  The thing is, though, she's only been there two years, and she's only got two years until she's 18.  There's not enough time.  If she was 12 or 10, things could get ugly.  But she's almost too old now.  Like, she's a legal adult in two years.  Yeah, that's true.  There's no time for her.  She'll probably go back there to train, though, if it worked out for this Olympics. 
[00:40:00]  Because she's got easily another one in her.  Yeah, she's fucking...  How long is there...  Oh, man.  How long is the shelf life of these...  Not long at all, especially now.  25, maybe?  I don't even know if she's going to have another fucking...  If you look at Gabby...  No, because she's so young.  20, she could do it.  24 is rough.  20 is even rough.  24 for a gymnast is rough.  How old was she?  How many each?  Six fucking...  Wasn't she 14 or 16?  I don't know.  I think she was 16.  16, maybe.  Yeah.  Unless they change the rules.  You have to be 16 or turn 16 during the Olympics. 
[00:40:30]  The only ones that look any good are the ones that are fucking, you know, 16, 17, 18.  And Gabby's biological mom there, the real mom, I guess, has big boobies.  If Gabby starts sprouting in the next couple of years, she's going to be in trouble.  So you might be right.  This could be it.  I think this is it for her.  At 16, her career is over.  I don't think you can fucking...  At 20?  Nah.  Nah.  The body starts really changing, you know?  Maybe you could do others...  Can't they do others...  Like, maybe you don't do exactly that. 
[00:41:00]  Like, you know how you see them do, like, the fucking...  What are they?  The circle things they swing on?  The rings.  The rings.  That's a guy's sport.  Oh, is that a guy's sport?  Yeah, because they don't have the strength for that, really.  I was watching guys do that.  It's ridiculous.  And I was like, I didn't know men could do that.  Like, I'm so out of shape.  Like, I do 20 push-ups, and I'm like, all right, time for a Weight Watchers ice cream.  These guys are fucking, like, they come out to the...  They hold their arms, and they come out to the side on their...  Also, the floor routine they do, where they just slowly... 
[00:41:30]  It's so fucking slow.  They put their hands on the mat, and then just lift their feet up off the mat, and go  into a handstand.  Amazing.  But really, like, slow.  Yeah, it's amazing.  How do you fucking do that?  It really is amazing.  I don't know.  Craziness.  So, you might be right, Ann, because I think the Olympic team completely changes every four  years.  They're all teens.  There's no one from last Olympics.  No, they're done.  They're fucking done.  Who was the last American gymnast that did two Olympics and did okay? 
[00:42:00]  That's the question today.  If someone has the answer for that.  Is Carrie Shrug just did one?  Oh, she did one.  Carrie Shrug did not age well.  Did you see the little short film they did?  No.  It was pretty amazing what she did with that coach.  I don't know his name.  You can do it, Carrie.  You can do it.  All I think about was the bit on SNL.  It was so fucking funny.  And then she does it with basically, her leg might as well have been broken.  It was ligament damage and shit.  And then he carries her off all dramatically.  You can do it, Carrie. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You can do it.  Carries her off.  She's crying.  He's like, has that Kreskin personality just way too much all the time.  Over the top.  Like Bob Costas was trying to interview him.  Bella Carolli.  Bella Carolli.  Thank you.  And he's just over the top with everything he does.  Bella.  Is he still coaching this guy?  Bella?  I don't know.  I would assume he is.  Shannon Miller.  What year was that?  Mary Lou Rett.  Oh, that was 16 years ago already.  Wow.  I think it was 90.  Wow. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  It was a while ago.  Oh, 96 is, yeah, okay, 16 years ago.  Yeah.  That was the Atlanta Olympics, right?  Where Iraq was close to the bomb or something.  Oh, Iraq fucking, yeah.  I don't know.  He heard like an explosion or something.  I don't know.  Iraq said he was there and then not to talk about it.  And then he had a secret.  He was part of the case.  Investigation.  Why wouldn't you talk about it?  He had to like be a witness.  I don't know.  Iraq, why would you talk about it?  Have you ever talked about it on the air?  No, I didn't know this.  Never.  Oh.  We're blowing up your spot. 
[00:43:30]  Wait.  Blowing up his spot.  16 years later?  Yeah.  The Richard Jewell case, right?  No, we talked about this, but you were very vague.  Yeah, I showed you something like years ago, but you were like, yeah, who cares?  What was it?  That was it.  Oh.  No, I was.  See how I can't prove that actually happened?  See?  See how he is?  Okay.  I just said, who cares, really?  Well, why would Eric Bigel tell us what happened?  Let Eric Vagel tell us what happened.  So what happened, Eric Vagel? 
[00:44:00]  Let's go.  Eric Vagel.  What happened?  I don't remember that.  What happened in the 96 Olympics?  I was in Centennial Park when the bomb went off.  So we're a lot of people.  Why are you different?  How far were you, honestly?  Were you in the parking lot just pulling up?  No, I was right near it.  Um, I didn't get hurt from that, but I got trampled on by people when they were trying  to flee the park.  Whoa.  Did you make money off that, too?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  This guy knows how to make money, man.  Wait, how did you make money? 
[00:44:30]  You sued them?  No, no, I got compensation from the people who I was working for and from the, uh...  How much did you make?  How much?  Yeah, how much?  Not a lot, but how much?  Were you working for the bomber?  How much?  How much did you make?  What?  You can't say it.  What's it?  No, that's fine.  How much cash?  It wasn't that much.  Right, so why can't you say it?  Is that a big secret?  10, 20 Gs?  No, not that much.  100?  No.  What's the amount?  A good dinner for you?  Yeah.  Oh, $1,000?  How much do you get for an Olympic bomb trampoline? 
[00:45:00]  I'm wondering what the...  Yeah, what's the going on?  Why are you so vague all the time?  Yeah, why are you vague about that?  Who gives a fuck if it was $200?  Why didn't you bring this up?  What?  What?  Why do we bring it up?  It's the Olympics.  No, I didn't bring this up.  We know that, but now we're asking you.  So, like, you got...  What kind of injuries did you sustain?  I had a concussion, a sprained wrist, and something to my shoulder.  Okay, so you got knocked over.  Yeah.  Now, and your company said, look, we're going to take care of you, or did you threaten legal action?  No, the company said, because I was technically still on the clock.  What were you doing there?  I was working for NBC at the time. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, you were?  Okay.  So this is a bit of a drop-off, huh?  You're working for NBC, and they said we're going to...  Why are my fucking pants so high?  It's just how you're sitting.  I know.  They said we're going to...  I always have high waters, loser.  So you said that NBC said we're going to take care of you?  Yeah.  And how much did they give you to prevent you from suing them?  NBC wasn't...  I didn't have to sue NBC or anything like that.  I know.  I'm saying, how much did they give you to prevent you from suing them?  They gave me a few thousand. 
[00:46:00]  What's a few thousand?  A five thousand?  I was under five at that time.  Jesus.  All right.  Was it more than one?  Yeah.  I don't remember.  It was like three or four thousand.  This was something that should have taken ten seconds.  We're five minutes into this.  Just say it's about a couple thousand.  I did.  And then we can move on.  And you keep going about exact change.  Oh, is that...  Well, dude, I'm not exact change, but you're saying it's under five thousand.  Like, if you said it's around two grand, I would know what you meant.  Right.  But at first, I didn't know if it was 150,000 or...  No.  I said it wasn't that much.  It's between three and four thousand. 
[00:46:30]  That's...  Why didn't you just start running with everyone else?  I had to get trampled.  I was trying to, but at that point, everybody...  There's only certain exits you can get out of the park.  You want to drop a seppoly.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Because this is what I want...  It is important, because now what I want to say is NBC got off easy.  You should have got more.  Yeah, but I was also involved with the FBI case.  Oh.  How are you involved now?  How did you get involved? 
[00:47:00]  How are you involved with the FBI case?  Because anyone who got hurt in any capacity in that location from the bombing was automatically  involved with the FBI investigation.  Okay.  So when they caught the guy that did it, I was notified, and I had to fill out a few  things for...  Who did they catch that did it?  A guy named Eric Randolph.  Oh, is that who...  Was he the abortion bomber?  The abortion shooter, too?  I think he was.  That same scumbag.  Eric Rudolph?  Eric Randolph.  Yeah, Rudolph.  Is that the guy that did the Olympics?  Yeah, that's the one that... 
[00:47:30]  What a piece of garbage.  Yeah.  He was out the one...  I think he was the abortion shooter that they were looking for.  He was on the lam for a long time.  Yep, yep.  Can you Google that, Sam?  I want to make sure that that's right, so I'm not fucking...  I don't want to say that he did it, but he didn't...  He's in jail, right?  He's fucking...  He's like a religious fanatic.  Of course he's in jail, yeah.  And then that...  Yeah, they had hung that other guy out to dry.  Richard Jewell.  Richard Jewell.  No one believed him.  Now, if anybody deserved to sue...  I'm sure he did.  I'm sure he did all right, right?  The FBI fucked him so good. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, boy, did they?  They fucked him really good.  The whole country hated him.  So what did the FBI want with Iraq?  For a while.  Because he was injured in the bombing, even though when they came in, everybody probably  came in with shrapnel wounds, and you walked in and said, what happened?  I fell and bumped my shoulder when I heard the news.  All right, take it easy.  All right.  So what did the FBI say to you?  They took a statement for what I remember, what I saw, did I see certain things that they  were asking me. 
[00:48:30]  Did you see the flash?  No, but I felt the explosion.  It was right behind me.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Damn.  And so how long did you talk to the FBI for?  A couple years.  That's a long time.  That's a long interview.  Wow.  With breaks?  Did they allow you to eat?  With a light in his face.  Right.  Happened.  Can you imagine being sitting there for two years?  Two years.  Oh, God.  I didn't do this.  Come on.  What else are you going to ask me?  Holy fuck.  From me. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  So you felt the explosion.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  I've now said that 18,000 times.  Two years.  Two years off and on, huh?  What could they possibly have?  That's how vague your story was.  I thought you knew.  Yeah, because you were probably vague to them.  I think we ought to revisit this Nagel guy.  Yeah.  See, he seems elusive.  Yeah.  He seems like he's hiding something.  Wow.  Two years.  All right.  That was fun.  Did anyone die in that?  No.  A couple people did. 
[00:49:30]  Wait, did we have deaths?  Yeah.  Yeah.  One was a camera guy from, I think, Indonesia.  Not good.  And I forgot who the other person was.  It was two people?  Two people.  That Eric Rudolph should just be fucking shot in the temple.  Well, the article's somewhere at home.  Yeah, he ruined the Olympics.  He's just a fucking, just a religious fanatic.  Thanks, Europe.  Fishbag.  You were talking about old Olympians, gymnasts?  Yes.  Supposedly, if I could believe, Josh Klinger.  There was a 37-year-old woman that competed in the vault last night. 
[00:50:00]  37?  No way.  Did she place?  How well did she do at 37?  Oh, and then remember that broad from Long Island, the Katrina broad?  Yeah.  Here's the other side of it.  We got another broad.  Oh, Jesus.  I wish Katrina would call back.  It's always this.  It's always, whenever somebody calls it something, someone else will call and say,  that person's an idiot.  And it's usually Long Island versus Jersey.  Yeah.  Never fails.  Who's this from Jersey?  Hello? 
[00:50:30]  Hi.  Who are you?  Hi, I'm Aisha.  Hello.  Ah, shit, Aisha.  Hi, Aisha.  Hi.  Hi.  Oh, okay.  Well, the first thing I wanted to say, like, I know you guys are kind of past it now, but  the girl called in and said, oh, Gabby shouldn't have won because of...  Hold on a minute.  Hold on a minute.  Hold on a minute.  That's a 37-year-old.  Holy shit.  What?  Shuffle looks like a logger.  You were wondering what gymnasts look like when they get old? 
[00:51:00]  Wow.  He's just like a man.  She looks like Jim Carrey.  Holy shit, she does from Dumb and Dumber.  Let's see her vault.  Hold on, sweetheart.  Don't go anywhere.  Yeah, she's...  Aisha, stay there for a second.  She looks like a man.  That looks like a boy.  Wow.  It's like Mark Hamill.  Yeah.  She looks like the lead singer from the Violent Femmes.  Unbelievable.  Her sixth Olympic Games.  Katie Lang.  Yeah, Katie Lang.  Little Katie Lang.  Silver medalist. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, my God.  You could just...  Oh, oh.  Not bad.  Pretty good.  Well, when they got to go pretty good for a 37-year-old.  Did he hear how loud she runs?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Down the ramp.  She is...  A little pixie.  Like Carmen Munster.  Initially, and she is a hero there in 2001.  All right.  All right, well.  She's the son from the great Santini.  That's what she looks...  You cry, sports fans.  Look at the body position.  Oh, God.  Now, her legs were coming apart at the end of the fucking spin. 
[00:52:00]  And then...  Poor woman.  It gets a 15.1.  And then she lands harder.  You know she pulled out her back or something.  Hold on.  Don't leave you, lady.  Second ball.  Look at how loud that is.  Oh, my God.  Ow.  All clumsy falling forward.  Oh, she's terrible.  She could do that.  Her body.  There's too much body there.  Yeah.  Too many memories.  She probably weighs like 115, which is crazy for these gals.  Too tall. 
[00:52:30]  Like the fucking momentum.  She's stunk.  It's just...  Oh, look how tiny she still is.  But she looks way bigger, right?  She looks bigger than...  Yeah.  I don't know.  Well...  So, wait.  Do you think...  Now, what...  Let's get back to Aisha.  Hi, Aisha.  Sorry.  Why do you...  This is becoming a black-white thing.  Yeah.  Aisha is obviously a woman of color.  Aisha.  I mean, it wasn't a thing of color, but I'm just like, okay, like, just suppose you  have a little expertise in something doesn't mean you're not a hater.  Like, just because you know how to make fucking pastries doesn't mean my cake isn't better 
[00:53:00]  than yours.  Oh, shit.  I think you make a good point.  That woman is absolutely a hater, because she's like, if you go to the blogs, we've been  discussing it nonstop since it happened.  All right.  Let it go.  Do you think she's being a hater, Aisha?  Yes.  I really...  And I hate to use the term hater, because I'm like, oh, this is a black girl fan hater,  but...  Yeah.  Haterade.  Haterade.  You're right.  Don't be a hater.  Be a participator.  Nice.  Nice.  Be a baked potato.  Yes.  I'm going to, like, you know, kind of just, like, interject, but my boyfriend is a really 
[00:53:30]  big fan of your show, and I just really would love him to wish him a happy birthday for me.  Happy birthday.  What's his name?  Yes.  He's Blake.  Blake?  How old is Blake?  Blake will be 26.  26?  Oh, when's he get out?  Well, it's not, right?  Oh, shit.  I'm sorry.  Happy birthday, Blake.  Happy birthday.  Well, what does Blake do for a living?  He's a basketball coach.  Oh.  Oh, well.  All right.  There you go.  Is he an ex-player? 
[00:54:00]  You don't see that much.  No.  Did he used to play?  Yes.  He used to play in high school.  How well endowed is Blake?  Does he have a big penis being an ex- a ball player?  Yes, yes.  He does have a big penis.  Oh, man.  How tall a guy is he?  Huh?  How tall a guy is he?  I want to say maybe about 5'6".  5'6"?  5'6"?  5'6"?  What, is he playing 1950?  Your boyfriend's Spud Webb? 
[00:54:30]  Jesus.  Damn.  Maybe 5'6".  I don't know.  He's a little guy.  Yeah.  He so didn't want you to say that he was 5'6 on a national radio show, by the way.  Damn.  Yay, but he's a great guy.  You always, you throw the number up a little higher for your man.  Where'd you meet the little fella?  He's like freaking Yao Ming.  Better?  No, I'm lying now.  No, where'd you meet him?  No black guy wants the world to know he's 5'6".  Well, is he black?  What?  Is he black or white? 
[00:55:00]  He's black.  Okay, because Blake doesn't know.  You can't tell it to him, Blake.  That's basketball, though.  Okay, but 5'6".  Yeah, well, I don't know.  I don't know if he's 5'6".  He might be taller than that, but...  I hope so.  He's right behind you with a gun going...  Damn.  Poor little guy.  Right.  Really?  I don't know if he's 5'6 anymore.  Yeah.  That means Blake is giving you some fucking lip right now.  So how'd you meet the little guy?  Where'd you guys meet?  Fella.  Little.  Yeah.  I met him at work.  What's that?  I met him at work.  You met him at work?  Whoa. 
[00:55:30]  This is getting weirder by the minute.  Short jobs.  Short jobs.  Short jobs.  Yeah, I'm already rifling in my head.  I know.  Fuck.  So what were you doing?  Was it a Wizard of Oz revival?  See, because it was midges and that.  See?  We're working at a school together.  I'm a teacher.  Oh, you're a teacher.  And you said to him, are you lost, son?  And he goes, hey, hey, I'm a teacher, too.  And you're like, oh, you're so short in stature.  I didn't realize. 
[00:56:00]  Hey, you wanted us to wish him a happy birthday.  That's right.  Little.  This is all your fault.  You guys suck.  No, you guys are great.  26 little candles on the cake.  Poor little fella.  Little guy.  Aw, happy birthday, Blake.  Little guy with his big cock.  Yeah.  I went for candles on his cake.  He's already feeling like he's getting old.  How old is he?  26?  Yeah.  I guess the cock ain't big.  He's so small.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It just looks giant.  Aw.  He's probably packing four and a half.  Yeah, but on him it looks amazing. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, exactly.  You know, I mean, as far as, I watch a lot of porn.  As far as dicks go.  Oh.  He's a nice one?  Yeah.  What kind of porn do you watch?  It's cool to hear that.  I mean, well, I don't know.  Like, you know how you're on a fucking porn site and you're just clicking around?  Sure.  I think he's watched a little bit of everything.  Like, one day I landed on that weird Japanese porn.  Whoa.  What, the anime?  Yeah, like, that mess is weird.  Yeah, that's strange.  With the tentacles and stuff. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  No, one time I was watching it and the guy, the white Japanese guy had the blackest dick  I've ever seen in my life.  Yeah, they like doing that.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, they make the Japanese guys have big black dicks, so big golden ones that glow.  What a weird culture.  And they have tentacles on them.  I know.  It's just odd.  I hate anime.  Yeah, it's terrible.  I hate it.  I actually don't mind it.  If you throw it in with the rest of the shit.  A dick with an octopus face?  How about you just stick a big dick in a vagina?  It's a culture that's so mad at itself. 
[00:57:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah, the Japanese are really...  I had to write a paper on hentai once, and it's just...  Yeah.  But they love trying to do something with their hair.  With their hair.  Maybe we ought to be nice to the Japanese today.  It is an anniversary today.  Which is it?  Jesus.  Is it?  Yeah.  Oh, Hiroshima.  Wow.  Yeah.  Hiroshima!  See, they're trying to make up for the fact they don't like their penises.  That's why when you watch a black-eyed white porn...  Yeah.  It's just a fucking black guy with white socks on.  Black guys always leave their socks on in porn. 
[00:58:00]  Really?  I don't know why, but they always leave...  Amateur porn with black dudes are...  They're fucking...  I guess they're just so anxious to...  Fuck.  Their socks are always on.  They just...  All right.  Thank you very much, Aisha.  You're welcome.  Thank you.  Yeah, we like you.  Happy birthday to Blake, all right?  Sounds very cute.  All right.  All right, Blake.  And Aisha, of course.  Aisha.  Why don't we break?  Yeah, I want to eat.  Let's do some eating.  Yeah.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I need somebody.  Help.  Not just anybody.  Help.  You know I need someone.  Help.  When I was younger, so much younger than today.  I never needed anybody's help in any way.  This is a good tone.  But now these days are gone, I'm not so self-assured.  And now I'm fine.  Now I'm fine. 
[00:59:00]  I'll change my mind.  I'll open up the doors.  Help me if you can.  I'm feeling down.  Bow.  Bow.  Bow.  And I do appreciate you.  You're ruining a song.  Now.  Can't get my feet back on the ground.  Won't you please, please help me.  All right.  Enough.  Beatles released Hell 47 years ago.  Watch this.  Yep.  Way to try. 
[00:59:30]  Are we still doing your segment?  No.  We don't have to.  You don't have to, he says.  I don't know.  47 years, though.  That's not 50 years.  It's not 45.  It's just 47 years ago.  No, it's just an odd number that really doesn't matter for anything.  I'm interviewing Ringo's brother-in-law today on The Boneyard.  What's the connection?  Joe Walsh.  Joe Walsh is Ringo Starr's brother-in-law.  Yeah.  Did not know that.  Yeah. 
[01:00:00]  I didn't either.  I think you're lying.  No, I'm not.  Oh, right.  He married, I guess it was the sister of the, I don't know if it was Ringo's sister or the  sister of Ringo's wife, but they are related.  Wow.  That's pretty cool.  What are you going to talk to him about?  I like his new song a lot.  I got the new album.  I like it a lot.  I've never been a huge.  Can we hear it?  Analog man.  Or at least part of it?  They said Ronnie B talked about it, but I don't, I didn't hear it.  And I guess it's been out for a month now, but.  Oh, okay. 
[01:00:30]  Well, that would be cool.  How was your trip to Chicago?  Un-fucking-believable, dude.  Unbelievable.  What makes this better than all the other times you've met Black Sabbath?  Well, I haven't interviewed them ever.  I never interviewed Ozzy Geezer and Tony together.  Really?  Never.  No.  It's always been separate.  Never.  I've never been in the same room with them except for that one photo I took that one time.  Well, fuck me.  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  I just assumed that you've done this a few times before.  Never.  Wow, that's kind of cool.  And I saw the one picture you tweeted where Ozzy was having a good laugh. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We.  And you were having a good laugh.  Yeah, they enjoyed me kind of ripping on myself.  And I talked to him for about 15 minutes.  I had 20 with them, but I asked them what I wanted to ask them, and Ozzy was getting very  antsy.  Like, this was three hours before a fucking headlining festival show.  And I was like, I knew that he was, because he was like, yeah, he was being cool, but I  could tell he wanted to get the fuck out of there.  But that's just pre-jitter, pre-gig stuff.  You know what I mean?  And I felt kind of, you know, because lead singers, man, all the fucking pressure is 
[01:01:30]  on them for a gig.  So we talked for about 15 minutes.  And I said to them at one point, I said to them, I'm like, I know you guys probably don't  do a lot of interviews before you do a gig.  And Tony goes, oh, no, we never do them before shows.  And Geezer goes, we only did it because it was you.  Wow.  I wanted to fucking cry.  I was so happy.  Oh, look at the picture.  That's a great picture.  Yeah.  That was just us yapping out.  When is the interview going to air?  It's going to air on, it was supposed to air Friday night before they went on stage. 
[01:02:00]  But fucking the FTP that Sirius had set up, which might not have been their fault.  Troy tried so hard to get this thing through.  I would assume it was their fault.  It might have been.  Let's just assume it was their fault.  It was very frustrating because we wanted to get this on the air.  Yeah, of course.  Before the Sabbath actually went on stage.  Did you see the rest of Lollapalooza?  As far as I was concerned, the whole thing was a three-day festival, so Sabbath could work Friday.  There could have been a brush fire, for all I cared. 
[01:02:30]  I saw no one before.  I saw no one.  Well, after, I couldn't stick around because, you know, when Sharon goes, why don't you come?  We're having some drinks afterwards.  Oh.  Yeah, we all know how that is.  Why don't you come by the Waldorf, which is where they were staying.  Ooh.  It's amazing how nice they all are to me.  The whole fucking camp.  So who did you hang out with?  Well, I walked into, after they came off, I had been raving to them about Under the Sun,  which is probably my favorite Sabbath song, or my top three.  I don't know it.  No, it's off volume four.  It's not one of the more popular ones, but I fucking love it. 
[01:03:00]  And they haven't done it live since 72.  And they played it.  Jesus.  They've been playing it on this tour.  Wow.  So I was talking to him about that, and anyway, so after the show, you know, we go back to  the hotel, and we take very quick showers, and Troy's still trying to upload this.  I'm like, let's fucking go!  I'm like, dude, Sabbath is waiting at the fucking hotel, and you're uploading this shit?  Fuck it!  I almost smashed him.  Losing his mind.  Yeah.  We got in the camp.  We get over there. 
[01:03:30]  We had to shower, because we both saw it like goats.  And we get over there, and we walk into this fucking, like, third floor dining area, and  there's nothing happening.  There's just a bunch of people eating dinner, and we look up, oh, there's Ozzy and Sharon  and Jack, and here's fucking Tony.  Like, I look down, and there's just Tony and I, but they're all just sitting down having  dinner, like they had just finished.  So Tony kind of looks at me and goes, hey!  And he indicates for me to sit down, but there's no chairs.  Oh, gosh.  So I'm like, I don't want to bother.  I'm like, I don't want to bother you what you're eating. 
[01:04:00]  He goes, oh, no, you're not bothering me.  So I'm like, what do I do?  What do I do?  And I go sit at another table, and then Tony's kind of looking at me like, what are you doing?  Like, Tony didn't know if he's supposed to come sit with me.  Oh, no.  So I'm like, I'm like, when else is Tony and I going to invite me?  So I just take a chair.  I left Troy at the table, and I dragged the fucking chair across the room, and I sat with  him.  I talked to him for about 20 minutes.  Nice.  And had a very nice chat.  Did you guys talk about everything but music?  No, we talked a lot of music, and he asked me, he goes, did you enjoy Under the 
[01:04:30]  Sun?  Oh.  They remembered that I liked it.  I was like, yeah, I loved it.  Oh, that's so sweet.  They treat him like a little retarded boy.  They really do.  It's like he's on a Make-A-Wish fucking foundation trip.  Do you understand what it's like to fucking...  Just assume it's a Make-A-Wish thing, but it's been going on for 15, 20 years now.  It's like, will this guy die already?  No.  Oh, you again.  We did our charity work enough already.  But when Geezer came in later, he asked me if I enjoyed the song.  They both remembered that I loved the song.  Yeah.  I was so out of my mind.  Did you talk to Ozzy at the Waldorf?  No, I just said hi to him, because he was talking to me. 
[01:05:00]  He was sitting at a table with Sharon, and when he was leaving, I said, see you later,  man.  He just patted my head and said, see you later.  Patted your head.  Yeah, he patted my head like a dog.  Like a little doggy.  But, you know, again, I tried to...  And we actually left before...  Ozzy left first, but Geezer and Tony were still there when we left.  I don't overstay the welcome.  We stayed for an hour, ate a sandwich, and hung out and talked.  Did you talk to Jack?  I did, yeah.  Well, Jack came up to me when we walked in.  I didn't even know he was there.  And he goes, hey, man.  How's he doing?  He said he was okay. 
[01:05:30]  I told him how well I thought he was handling things publicly.  Right.  And Sharon we talked to for a while, and Kelly looked fucking great.  You know, she looks really good, man.  The picture Troy Kwan Instagrammed, I guess.  Wow, she is...  She lost a lot of weight, man.  Really?  Yeah, she looks great, man.  Let me take a little look, see.  Yeah, he wanted a picture with...  Kelly Osbourne looks great.  Yeah, she looked fucking hot, man.  She's very fashionable.  Yeah, very, very...  Is she fashionable? 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  Look at that.  Look how slim she is, though.  Look at her on the left.  She's very slim.  What happened there?  She looks just...  She doesn't look unhealthy slim, either.  She just looks like...  She's got a really nice mouth.  She lost so much fucking weight.  Oh, yeah.  She lost that a while ago now.  Yeah.  I did not know that.  Yeah, she...  Wow, she's styling.  So everybody treated us fucking fantastically well.  And...  Wow.  Unfortunately, we couldn't get the audio upload.  So hopefully it'll come...  It'll play this week.  Troy wearing a muscle shirt at 40 years old. 
[01:06:30]  All right.  Oh, man.  All right.  He's probably not enjoying this...  All right.  ...this whole 40-year-old guy bit.  All right.  Well, you know.  I'm just jealous.  I wish I could still wear a muscle shirt, I guess.  Well...  And show those tats.  Oh, it was so embarrassing going out with Troy, too.  Like...  Yeah, I want some stories.  You and Troy in Chicago.  There's got to be more.  Well, we go to...  Just when we're going to Newark Airport, we were working into, like, the air tranks.  I drove to the airport. 
[01:07:00]  And Troy and I both have our sunglasses on.  And we come up the elevator, and there's a black girl working, like, just directing people  at the air train.  And she goes, GQ!  And of course she's looking at Troy.  Oh, no.  And she goes, did the GQ truck stop?  And so I'm like...  And of course I'm like, really?  Which...  Who do you mean?  And she goes, oh, both of you.  Both of you.  No.  She did.  Oh, no.  I'm so embarrassed.  Like, I was kidding.  But then she had to include me. 
[01:07:30]  She had to include you.  Oh, both of you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was Troy's ugly friend.  Aw.  Did you guys go out to dinner?  I went out to dinner.  Did all the cameras work?  When we...  Well, oh, yeah.  Well, when we got...  I heard rumors that a video camera might not have worked.  Yeah.  We were almost fucking Sam-less.  Oh, yeah.  He was very angry.  Why is Sam in trouble?  I don't know.  Why was he there?  Well, we get there.  And we did go out to dinner on the one night.  I forget where we went.  Where the fuck did... 
[01:08:00]  I went to this steakhouse.  And just had a nice dinner.  A little bit of steakhouse.  And Troy went out and did...  I don't even know what he did.  I know what I did.  I know what I did.  Anything you want to share or just keep it at that?  A few hundred bucks down the train each night.  And then we...  Oh, by the way, for the interview, we had...  We were in the...  We had 20 minutes with them with...  This is the next day.  At 5 o'clock.  They were going on at 8 o'clock.  In the...  They call it Sabbath Village, which is they have their own little area of trailers and stuff like that. 
[01:08:30]  And...  Sabbath Village.  That's what it's called, yeah.  So we were going to be in the production office.  And we get the mic set up and everything's working.  We have a video camera to videotape this monumental event in my life.  And it's Sam's video camera.  And we open it and it just keeps saying,  Check memory card.  Check memory card.  So we pull the memory card out and it's simply not working.  They put another memory card in.  It's simply not working.  Do you have the video camera back?  No, not yet.  Where's Troy? 
[01:09:00]  He should be here.  Sam.  Why would you give him shitty goods?  What the fuck, Sam?  I'll tell you, this is what prevented me from having a meltdown.  Is I had my camera that I always carry, which has video, and it's a good video.  It's a good camera.  And we had iPhone.  Liam took an iPhone video.  So I actually got two videos of it.  Troy, do you have Sam's camera?  Yeah.  Now, can you check why it doesn't work?  Troy, did Jimmy lose his mind when the camera wasn't working? 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, he was freaking out.  I was furious.  I'm surprised.  It's doing it again.  Yeah.  Check.  Yeah, see?  But I mean, when I handed it to Troy before he left.  Troy said they did check it.  And it did work.  And it did work.  I believe them, too.  But how old is that camera?  It's brand new.  Okay.  It's just one of those things.  It just wasn't working.  And we took out the cards, put them back in.  We put different cards in.  I got good video on mine, though.  So I would assume Troy dropped the camera.  That's what I thought.  Yeah.  Troy dropped the camera somewhere and just doesn't want to. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Something happened.  Jostled the whole thing.  No, I didn't drop the camera.  I mean, you know, it could have gotten jostled around on the way out there.  Contents will shift during travel.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Troy booked the camera.  I kind of assumed.  Yeah.  But we got two different cameras.  Because for the record, every time I've traveled with you, Jim, we've had a functional camera.  Oh, shit.  Just blame Troy Kwan.  That's what you just said.  I said, Troy, you're getting a lot of blame.  Operator error.  You just blamed Troy.  Well, I mean, the audio sounds great.  Why no voice? 
[01:10:30]  It's been a brutal weekend, dude.  Oh, really?  What have you been up to?  It was Lollapalooza was awesome.  I had a great time.  But it was hot, hot.  And I had about 50, 60 pounds of recording equipment on my back.  And where we were staying, where you enter the park, where we interviewed Black Sabbath  was at the other end.  So picture like, you know, Columbus Circle of Central Park having to go all the way up  into Harlem.  No.  Yeah.  It was far, man.  It was probably about, I'd probably say two miles. 
[01:11:00]  Wow.  Wow.  And then in the heat.  Yeah.  And then we had to sit there and then we had to wait.  Are you dehydrated?  I know, right?  Maybe you're just dehydrated.  Do you need some water?  Oh, dude.  It was fucking brutal.  You might need to rehire.  I still haven't recovered.  And then afterward, it sounds like he's-  He really does sound-  You sound very dry.  Terrible.  And then after that, we went, we were trying to figure out the FTP was all fucked up.  There was no internet.  And then Sabbath was playing then at the other end of the park.  So then we had to go all the way back with our equipment.  And then after Sabbath was done, it was literally like a stampede to get out of there. 
[01:11:30]  And we had to get back to the hotel room to drop off the equipment and shower.  So we like hauled ass to the, back to the hotel and then went over to hang with Sabbath then.  I almost forgot to, as Sabbath came out, as they're coming out, this fucking girl comes  over to me and she goes, Jim Norton, I love you.  And I, I don't want to, she was really cute though, but I'm like, I don't want to talk  to anybody when fucking Ozzy and Sabbath are coming out. 
[01:12:00]  But, uh, as the, the, they opened with the song, Black Sabbath and, uh, we're talking  and she fucking just starts rubbing my cock.  Oh man.  She's fucking, did she not?  No, I, I, she was, that's just the reaction.  I believe she was grabbing my cock and I was like, just rubbing the side of her ass and  just feeling her panties.  And then she went away.  That was it.  That was it.  But while Ozzy was coming out, she's like, I love you, Jim.  And Jim is freaking out.  Jim's like in a kid in a candy store.  Oh, he's looking at the girl and then he's looking back at Sabbath and he's looking at 
[01:12:30]  the girl and he's looking back at Sabbath and he was just, he was in heaven.  I was really turned on because I'm like, have you ever seen Sabbath?  She goes, of course not.  I'm 25.  I was like, Oh man.  Aren't you lovely?  Wow.  So, um, look at you.  Any other Norton stories?  Well, he was really a pleasure to hang out with on the road.  We had a blast.  Yeah, we had fun.  We really had a lot of fun.  Uh, going out was a lot of fun.  Cause he was really excited about his Cialis rod the entire way out.  Oh yeah.  I forgot about that.  That was Cialis boner on the plane. 
[01:13:00]  He kept talking about it.  On the plane.  I was embarrassed.  I couldn't get up to pee half the time.  I had to pee twice.  I had to wait.  Why on the plane?  Can you strap that shit down?  No, it's just literally, you know, there's no explanation.  When you're special.  Oh, we do sweatpants.  I forget.  Always.  Yeah.  But why were you on the plane with Cialis?  Dude, when you're flying.  No, no.  I just had taken it the day before.  Oh, okay.  When you're flying, you know, the little, the fucking motion is jostling your hiney and testicles.  You can't help it.  Jimmy's on a fucking billion dollar vibrator. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, pretty much.  Prostate shaker.  And you know what?  There was a lot of talk about Ozzy's and, I mean, Bill Ward not being there.  Because, you know, there's all this contract stuff with the band and the lawyers.  So they used Tommy, who's Ozzy's solo drummer.  And he is fucking awesome.  Like, I love Bill Ward.  I mean, I love Bill Ward.  You can really tell the difference between the two?  Well, I haven't, because I didn't see Bill play on this tour, so I don't know.  But, I mean, you know, Bill's an older guy.  Younger guy, full of energy and shit. 
[01:14:00]  This guy's a fucking animal.  Powerhouse.  What's his name?  Tommy Klufotis?  I can never say his name.  I always fuck his name up.  But he is a fucking animal.  And he sounded incredible.  Unbelievably good.  Ferocious.  Has he done Sabbath shows before this?  Just a few.  I think he's working on the album.  I mean, just this tour.  But he's, you know, again, they did a drum solo.  And I actually thought, can we do something with a drum solo?  Everybody hates it.  They're a weird younger audience.  They were not a Sabbath audience.  Well, Lollapalooza is pretty old now, though. 
[01:14:30]  But, I mean, it's not a Sabbath crowd.  No, I mean the festival itself.  I wonder if that, does that get older people going or no?  All 25, 30-year-olds around where we were, man.  All of them.  Yeah.  And the drum solo, they actually were standing for and cheering.  Like, they were fucking, the crowd was loving the drum solo.  Like, which is really, you don't see that a lot of times in metal shows.  But he was fucking awesome, man.  I was really.  You have to give them rave reviews.  They are, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, that son of a bitch can play.  Wow.  Great.  And he looks like Bill Ward in 1979. 
[01:15:00]  He looks like fucking old Bill Ward.  That's important, too.  You don't want the guy that looks totally out of place in a band.  Like, they have the regular members of a band that's getting a little older.  And then, like, oh, why is the bass player 23?  He has fucking.  23-year-old asshole.  He has fucking.  Stealing the spotlight.  Pigtails.  He has pigtails like Bill Ward did in the, like, I think at one point.  Oh.  Oh, so he's.  Can you Google him if you're done messing with your awful broken camera?  Is it fixed?  It's still fucked up.  Well, the inner, the hard drive on it works. 
[01:15:30]  Well, I asked.  That's why I called up and said, how do you fucking record the hard drive?  Well, I can't.  I didn't have the camera in front of me.  Oh, okay.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Sam.  You should have known.  It was a high-pressure situation.  Sam, just accept it was your fault somehow.  Of course.  I mean, it wasn't.  Of course it is.  Well, we did say to him, how do we record on the hard drive?  He didn't know how to do it.  Yeah, I got to hold the camera.  Oh, there you go.  Jimmy is blaming you.  Like, walking through instructions.  Jimmy's blaming you.  Well, you should have showed Troy to do that.  See, I told you, Jimmy really is blaming you.  No, I don't care.  I got it on video, actually.  We have two cameras. 
[01:16:00]  Shoot, too.  We did it on his iPhone and on the other camera.  Troy, how hot is Kelly Osbourne?  I don't give a fuck about that other shit.  She's looking.  She's stunning.  I mean, she walked in.  I couldn't believe it.  She really is hot, right?  She has this tiny little body now, and you're just like, holy shit.  But she doesn't look gaunt.  Like, she looks fucking salmon.  Like, she meant to lose the weight.  Like, she fucking worked on it.  It's all about her mouth.  She's got a...  Yeah.  Her mouth.  Very kissable.  Punch up other pictures of her.  Like, new ones, Sam.  Don't fucking...  Why is there being mad at me?  Because you'll fucking pull up something from...  Because these guys know you almost cost me a video of my interviewing you. 
[01:16:30]  I didn't call them any.  These are Tony and Oz.  You're blaming Sam?  Well, it's not my camera.  Yeah.  How old is that?  It's the operator who was there with you.  You had a guy.  How old was that picture?  You had a room with three people.  You and Liam were both in there.  Within the last year.  Yeah.  She's...  I don't know.  She kind of is doing almost a gray hair thing.  Purplish gray.  Purplish gray, right?  Yeah.  She's stunning in person.  Sharon is beautiful in person, too.  Yeah.  I told you the first time I met Sharon, for real, I understood why Ozzy liked... 
[01:17:00]  There's a fucking weird, sexy vibe she has when she talks to you, man.  I got it.  And you can tell she does stuff.  Oh.  Yeah.  She's probably filthy.  She's coming there.  You can tell she does things.  She's in like a rubber dress.  Yeah.  She's all right, man.  Any other stories from Chicago?  You spent a lot of time by yourself, huh, Troy?  No.  We actually hung out a lot.  We went to the gym together.  We were...  Oh, right.  Went out to dinner together.  Went out to lunch.  All right.  Good.  We hung out.  I mean, I did leave you to go talk to Tony at one point, but...  Is Jim a...  Is he an animal in the gym? 
[01:17:30]  He hit it hard.  I mean, he was...  I just did 25.  I swam one day, and the next day, I fucking did 30 minutes on the electrical machine.  And then yesterday, I hit the heavy bag, finally.  I'm getting back.  No more playing games.  But yeah, it was cool to see Jim in Sabbath mode.  He gets like...  Focused.  Yeah.  He's in...  He's just in rock and roll mode.  It was great, though.  I mean, it was...  It was cool.  And Sabbath sounded fucking incredible.  I mean, they just...  Are you a Sabbath fan?  I like Sabbath.  I definitely respect them a lot.  And then I like them more now than I ever have. 
[01:18:00]  They sounded like a modern rock band.  I mean, they sounded like...  Those songs could have come out right now.  Ozzy sounded good.  You know, it was a lot of fun.  And then getting a chance to actually have dinner with them afterward was quite an experience.  Does Ozzy do any of his solo stuff in a Sabbath show?  No, never.  Never?  Never.  They didn't play anything after like 75, right?  No, they did everything up to 70.  The latest song they played was Dirty Women, which is off of Technical Ecstasy, which is... 
[01:18:30]  I really don't know any of this stuff.  Yeah, that's not one of their more...  I mean, Dirty Women, if you're a Sabbath fan, you know it.  But it's not like a huge...  It's not like fucking War Pigs.  But that's 76.  I don't think they played...  They played nothing off Never Say Die.  Why doesn't Ozzy break out a solo song?  It just wouldn't fit the mode.  No.  They don't do any of the Dio stuff either.  They simply do the first...  And there's so many fucking tunes that...  You know, again, there's so many songs I've never heard.  I've never heard fucking...  Whatever, I can just list a bunch of Sabbath songs. 
[01:19:00]  But there's so many things I've never heard.  But the set list was awesome.  You know, they did Electric Funeral, Into the Void.  Fucking heavy, man.  It was a really heavy fucking set.  And they had Behind the Wall of Sleep, which is off of the first record.  I was out of my mind.  Out of my fucking mind happy.  It's really nice when you go to a show and just know every song.  Dude, but I couldn't believe they did a couple of them.  Like, Behind the Wall of Sleep was a...  You know, would I have loved to have seen fucking...  You know, maybe a Tomorrow's Dream or fucking, you know... 
[01:19:30]  And I don't know any of these.  But it's just great that Jimmy's like, you know, I know that one.  And I asked Geezer a fucking lyric question, which they answered, I think.  What was it?  Just about a lyric in Never Say Die.  Why don't you put Jimmy Norton in a song?  I would love that.  I'll imagine that as a tribute to you.  I was so happy when they fucking both asked me independently if I heard the song and liked it.  I was like, yes, I did.  Yes, I did.  They loved it.  They really love Jim.  I put up a picture on my Instagram of when they were taking a picture. 
[01:20:00]  I took a picture of that.  And you could just see the smile on Jim's face.  It was like...  Yeah, I was very pleased.  I was very happy.  It was adorable.  And Sharon, thank you.  Afterwards, I spoke to Sharon for a minute.  Because, again, I don't walk over the table.  Hi, I was like, I really am.  Be the annoying guy.  I'm better in those situations than you'd expect me to be.  Like, as much of a fanboy cunt as I am.  Like, if people are eating and stuff, I don't fucking go ballistic.  Well, it's not that you don't want to.  It's that you know it would fuck up this whole relationship thing that you have. 
[01:20:30]  Whatever my motives may be.  Yes, exactly.  If I knew that they would all forget it the next morning, I would literally dive on the  table and go, hi, gang.  And I'm just, hi, gang.  But she, as I'm leaving, she goes, thank you for everything you do for us.  Like, I guess because she, you know, the show on the...  But I can't do anything.  Right.  Like, you guys are nice to me.  And I guess, oh yeah, I guess it does help to help promote the bandwagon.  Yeah, the promoting.  I don't really do anything for them.  I just kind of show up and love them.  Did Sharon talk about America's Got Talent? 
[01:21:00]  Because she's leaving the show.  No, you know what?  And she's leaving because of what NBC did to Jack.  And I, it's funny, I wish I would have known that because I would have asked Jack about  it.  I guess Jack had a deal or a show that was happening with NBC and after the MS announcement,  they kind of backed out of the deal or something like that.  So Sharon's like, well, fuck you.  Yeah, they're very, very loyal family-wise.  Something like that.  What's, oh yeah, hell yeah.  What are the details on this?  What it looks like is there was some kind of a tentative deal with Jack.  And I said, and he had some guys there from this military show who were like, uh, maybe 
[01:21:30]  it's a different show he's doing, but he had some stars and stripes.  That was stars, earn stripes, earn stripes.  They cut ties with, uh, Jack 26 after he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.  That's basically it.  So Sharon's like, well then fuck you.  I'm out.  She was angry.  She's going to leave America's Got Talent.  All right.  And they said that, uh, I guess they're saying that Jack's doctor said it would be strenuous  for him, but I heard Jack offered to take out his own insurance policy and they said 
[01:22:00]  no.  Well, here's the deal.  Uh, they fired Jack by email two days before he was to report to work.  That's terrible.  Then lied about it to the press, said Osborne 59.  And they didn't.  I just can't be fake.  She said, this is why she's a rock star.  It's discrimination and it was badly handled.  So she's given up a really easy, good, paying gig, uh, for obviously her son.  And, uh, she, and she, and she doesn't need the money.  Obviously it's not like they're getting the Osborne. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  But poor Ozzy is probably like, oh fuck.  Cause now like she had this money gig coming in and that's his extra gigs.  He's got to do now.  He's got to go out on the road more.  There goes my fucking new European vacation.  I go out to work.  But yeah, I, I respect the fact that, uh, that she's, she's taking a stand and they  said, in all fairness, sorry, uh, Jimmy, uh, the producer of the show says he insists  David Hurwitz insisted Jack was never hired.  They said, and the, and the, and the Osborne's admit that he had never signed anything, but 
[01:23:00]  they have an email saying, Hey, looking forward to working with you.  It was one of these verbal things.  Oh yeah.  That exists.  Okay.  That's the next line.  Good for you.  50 page contract was never signed, but they, uh, contend all parties were moving forward  on a verbal commitment common in the industry.  Yeah.  It's like, you know, like, Hey, we'll see, we, we, we know it's happening.  What, what, what did I do that we didn't have anything signed up until, oh, when I did  my special, when I shot my special for epics, there was a bunch of stuff that we were trying  to work out and venue and location, but we were moving forward with the process, even 
[01:23:30]  though it wasn't signed and it had to be signed.  And we were all in the process together where you're going and we know it has to be signed.  And it was, uh, we can now move forward with Jack's participation.  The email read the rigors of the show were too intense for, but Jack says he completed  a 30 mile, 16 hour endurance race in January.  That's, that's impressive.  And it said that he offered, like Jimmy said, to buy his own insurance policy.  And they said, and by the way, they offered the NBC execs offered to pay Jack his full appearance 
[01:24:00]  fee and Sharon refused.  Uh, I guess they don't want the money.  Wow.  Um, and, and a network, this is why you have to hate all networks and the way they handle  things.  This is, this is how soulless and cut and dry they are.  A network rep said, Sharon has been a valuable part of the NBC family.  We regret any misunderstanding and wish Jack well.  Like what a non feeling, uh, network rep thing to say.  It makes it sound like they didn't do anything bad.  They're like, oh, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We love you. 
[01:24:30]  Take a hike.  Are you going to get over, um, Sam's camera thing?  I'm already over it.  You sure you're all right with it?  Dude, I have.  Sam kind of lets you down on this one, huh?  Well, you guys have traveled a lot together.  So this is good.  Yeah, but when we travel together, everything's been successful.  I'm not saying it's Troy's fault.  I'm just saying it's certainly.  Whose fault is it more, Troy's or Sam's?  It's, it's, I'll tell you this.  It's, it's, it's, it's not a fault issue because while I can be very bummed out that we didn't  have that, the flip side is I'm so grateful I carry mine with me. 
[01:25:00]  Like, that's why I have a good fucking, uh, camera and it came in handy.  And you know what?  So you knew you couldn't trust Sam going into this.  So you had your backup video camera.  You always have to know that the possibility of him falling on his face is there.  I didn't fall anywhere.  Well, you did a little bit by not.  I'll tell you how you felt.  You had two people with you.  Yes.  You think Sam's mom is yelling at the radio right now?  Well, she probably knows that Sam should have prepped for this and, and totally.  I had nothing to do with it.  I shouldn't have prepped anything for it. 
[01:25:30]  You should have showed Troy how to use the camera.  What for?  Because there's something like this could happen.  And I showed him how to use it.  Did you show him how?  And we even called Sam, by the way.  Yeah.  And said, how do you switch it to, because my genius was that I knew that it was probably  a memory card issue.  So I'm like, let's go to the hard drive.  Hard drive.  Sam didn't know how to do it.  So Sam's not good at troubleshooting.  That's what I'm saying.  An excellent point.  Sam.  Please.  I'm just asking the questions.  I'm not a good troubleshooter.  I'm just asking the questions.  Please.  I'm trying to help you out here.  But he's not a good troubleshooter.  You're not a good troubleshooter.  Terrible.  But it's not my job. 
[01:26:00]  I had nothing to do with this.  But technically this, if you do give the camera, if it is your camera, and you are  in charge of the camera, and have typically had camera duties handed to you, then troubleshooting  would be in your wheelhouse.  Yes.  Yeah, but it wasn't even used for the show.  Like you said, it would be like any other channel.  It was for the boneyard.  Yeah, but we could still.  I don't have anything to do with the boneyard.  No, but you are a part of this show, and that's audio that absolutely could have been  used for this show.  Or we could have gotten a good moment that was uploaded to the Opie Anthony Facebook page.  But that's not what it was used for. 
[01:26:30]  Sure it was.  And you had a guy from the show with you.  Oh, boy.  I did.  But the camera wasn't in trouble.  Sam's not a good troubleshooter.  No, he's not.  Oh, I mean, you know, we called him with literally in a pinch where the band is walking to the  trailer.  Oh, he's helping them out.  No, I mean, you know, Sam did hand me the camera.  We checked it here.  Right.  And, you know, I don't really know what happened from here to there.  Something happened.  It was a mechanical error.  Where was the camera?  It was in my bag. 
[01:27:00]  Carry-on?  Yeah.  It was in carry-on.  So it got scanned.  So maybe something happened in the scan.  Why?  No.  But you've got to put it in the carry-on.  Nothing ever breaks in the scan.  You have to.  Figure that shit out.  It's fine.  I got my, I literally got my, I got my, and you know what, even when Sam and I do stuff  on the road, the audio he syncs up is audio from the microphones.  We never just use the raw camera audio.  Right.  So I have the audio here.  I can do the same thing.  This is a fucking, uh.  Well, Sam does some things well.  A lot of things. 
[01:27:30]  Very well.  But the troubleshooting is a little rough.  I guess I won't be a troubleshooter for my life then.  There goes that goal.  No troubleshooting for you?  Yeah.  Well, yeah, I mean.  I guess troubleshooting won't be in my wheelhouse.  I'll remove that from my skill set.  You're going to remove that from your resume?  Great troubleshooter.  Delete.  You can't hear it because it's coming out of my camera.  Yeah.  But I have it on my, uh.  It's great quality.  Look at the quality.  That's fine.  It really is.  No, that's a very good video.  And from what I hear, Troy did a fantastic job with the audio because he had four different 
[01:28:00]  mics, right?  Four different mics.  Four different inputs.  Yeah.  Everybody's on their own track.  And Ozzy was holding the mic a little too low.  So was Tony.  But again, these guys are in fucking gig mode.  And I can't believe I got them to talk to me.  One last question.  And it's a very good question coming in from Pitchbanger.  Who is Jimmy's favorite roadie?  Sam or Troy?  Hard to say because the experience is so tainted by the obvious breakdown in technical communications. 
[01:28:30]  You know, I just feel like nobody helped me on that one.  But who's more fun to be on the road with?  Sam or Troy?  I know Troy's only done one.  And Sam is basically your travel partner.  And Troy was also very motivated to do chip stuff.  I couldn't do chip stuff because I was too focused.  I was literally just too thinking about Sabbath to fuck around.  I couldn't even do chip.  They're both great.  Honestly, I had fun.  And both of them do a very responsible job. 
[01:29:00]  They're both very dutiful.  But one guy's a little bit better at troubleshooting than the other guy.  Hard to say because I've never been on the road with Sam where he's had to troubleshoot something.  But you know why?  That Troy just handed him.  By phone, he's not very good.  By phone, he's a valueless.  Please admit Sam's a failure.  But you never have to worry about any trouble when you're on the road with me because everything is checked in advance and everything is fine.  I know.  I make sure that you're not burdened.  Well, we checked in advance.  That's a shot of you, Troy.  Just in case you weren't sure.  Or Liam.  Liam was there, too. 
[01:29:30]  Audio-wise, everything was stellar.  Because I had four inputs.  I made sure everybody was good.  And I even was going out of that into a backup in case that machine failed.  I will say Troy was very – and the company came through big time with the equipment.  And Liam showed up dressed like fucking Philip Seymour Hoffman in Boogie Nights.  Liam's a disaster.  But he was great.  Liam came in and helped us get everything organized and helped get us into the Sabbath private area.  Because we were waiting in the artist's lounge.  And the Sabbath's road manager, Tim, was helping us. 
[01:30:00]  But, you know, he had other priorities.  So we wanted to get in there and set up.  So we actually just kind of snuck into the Sabbath area and thank God Sharon was there.  And he was like, oh, hi.  Why didn't you throw Sam's camera away and tell him that his camera's in Chicago somewhere?  I didn't think of that, but what a wonderful thing that would have been to do.  It's not my – I mean, it's Gary's camera, really.  I didn't buy it.  You could have – I'll throw it away today.  Yeah, it's just one of those things that, you know, you figure that people would be on your side.  But someone's bound to let you down.  And, you know, we did the best we could, I guess, with the defective equipment we were given. 
[01:30:30]  Well, you probably had a better time with me than you would Sam.  Right?  I mean, in all honesty.  Troy has described me as dork-o-rama.  No, no-rama.  Jimmy has a lot of power right now, but he's not using his power.  This is fucking my iPhone.  Did I get all on video?  That's good.  I'm so happy.  Yay, guys!  Yay, Sabbath!  Jimmy, you have a lot of power right now.  Troy wants to know if he's, you know, more fun to hang out with than Sam. 
[01:31:00]  You have a lot of power with this.  I feel uglier with Troy.  I was about to say, you'd never have to feel ugly around me.  That's a disadvantage.  But, again, Troy just can't help it.  But then again, I don't know how many situations I'll wind up in that are good because they want to meet Troy.  That's true.  So we walked out waiting for a cab to go to the Waldorf.  And one of the guys said to Troy, like, are you in a band at Lollapalooza?  Because everybody was looking at you when you walked out.  Oh, man.  Jeez.  So I was basically the ugly...  Do you get confused for someone in a Lollapalooza band, Jimmy? 
[01:31:30]  I haven't as of yet.  Just the loser part.  Were you hoping someone would confuse you?  I was hoping somebody would confuse me with a part of the festival.  Yes, I was hoping, but nobody did.  Jim was getting a lot of love, though, when we were walking through the crowd.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Everybody was like, yeah, Jim, what's up, Jim?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah, people were very nice.  That's awesome.  I had an amazing time.  And I just wished... 
[01:32:00]  Troy was in panic mode because of this audio.  But literally, we went to this tented area where Sirius was.  And there was a computer, which for whatever reason, the people that were there leave Troy.  It's password protected.  What the fuck?  And they don't tell Troy.  So he turns the computer on.  And he's like, oh, there's no...  So he's calling the fucking girl.  And Sam couldn't help, I'm sure.  Well, no.  The sad thing, that wouldn't be in Sam's wheelhouse.  For the record, when we did UFC, I uploaded a whole special.  That's just an issue.  I would have. 
[01:32:30]  That's true.  If I could have.  But it was password protected.  The internet sucked.  The FTP was broken.  These were things that were just genuinely not Troy's fault.  Jose was panicking.  But I watched Troy do it and send it.  And it said that it was sent.  He checked his sent email.  And it said it was sent.  I saw it.  Because he wouldn't go fucking watch Sabbath unless it was sent.  And so it was sent.  And then we trudged a fucking two miles across to the other side of the park.  And I waited in a long line and tinkled.  And then we watched it.  And I had my cock grabbed.  And fucking Ozzy came out.  And he was fucking...  The band was handsome and fucking sounded young. 
[01:33:00]  And fucking Tommy was great on the drums.  And they fucking did a wonderful set list.  And then we fucking walked back just hoping that black people didn't attack us.  Because we got a panicked email from a friend saying Chicago cops had warned them that young gangs come and fuck with people.  Young gangs?  Yeah.  But I think they do it probably a little later at night.  Not as 50,000, 60,000 people are leaving a venue.  I would think so.  And we went and showered and fucking met back downstairs in 10 minutes.  And fucking got a cab. 
[01:33:30]  And I gave some guy 20 bucks to jump ahead of him to take his cab.  Because I'm like fucking Sabbath is at the Waldorf.  And I'm waiting for a taxi.  And the guy was one guy ahead of us.  I was panicking.  One guy was ahead of us.  And the cab came for him finally.  And I gave him 20 bucks.  I'm like, we take your cab?  And he goes, yeah.  Yeah.  Nice.  So we fucking hopped in the cab.  And fucking I tried to act like I was from Chicago.  Just so the guy wouldn't take us for a ride.  I'm like, hey, it's good to be back.  You know, it was awful.  Did you hear that, Troy?  And the guy's like, what's the...  He didn't catch it.  And the guy's like, what's the cross street?  And I'm like, I don't know. 
[01:34:00]  And then he gave you a little loop around.  Yeah, I realized.  At that point.  Do you hear gun fire?  No, no, no.  No gunshots?  Not at all.  No, Chicago's a great city.  It's a great city, dude.  I love it.  We're going to have a blast out there.  We couldn't wait to get back.  We were saying how great it's going to be that we're coming back.  Yeah, yeah.  We're going to have a few days.  We leave Thursday, right?  Thursday after the show.  Big broadcast Friday in Chicago.  Should be fun, fun.  We normally don't.  But we just did it because it was you.  Look at Jimmy.  He's so happy. 
[01:34:30]  I couldn't have been happier.  Do you have a ride?  No, my dick wouldn't function in those moments.  I would panic too much.  My dick would just wilt and shame.  My excitement.  My joy.  It's the one time I don't check my Twitter.  I don't check my fucking texting.  None of it is.  It's all valueless to me.  None of that matters, right?  No, it really doesn't.  So we'll be playing some of that audio, I'm sure.  Great.  All right.  I guess what we learned is Sam fucked up.  Sam didn't.  And Jimmy had a great time with Black Sabbath.  That's what I'm hearing right now.  And I'm better to travel with him, Sam.  I heard that too.  That's not what he said. 
[01:35:00]  I heard that too.  I heard that.  He didn't say that.  He didn't even allude to it.  But it was.  He's trying to be nice about it, but I heard that.  And for the record, every time Jim and I have gone out, and it's been multiple times,  there's been video working and audio on the radio on time.  So I'm just saying things tend to get down when I go.  That's not my fault, though.  It was beyond my control.  Well, I don't have excuses either, so.  And we went and saw Sabbath.  You haven't done that with Jim, so.  That had nothing to do with you.  Well, I'm just saying that was part of the experience.  That's why you had a better time with me than we could do.  You know what?  That is a good point.  Yeah, but we interviewed a ton of fighters, so.  That's how you get to Jimmy's heart, is going to a Black Sabbath show with him. 
[01:35:30]  Sharing that.  Something you have not offered yet.  Sharing.  And when we went out, I could talk shop with Jim about metal.  You couldn't do that about UFC or metal.  Oh, man.  What band did the drummer for Sabbath?  You're a piece of shit.  The drummer for Sabbath.  Who was he the drummer for before?  Ozzy.  Before that.  I don't know.  Rob Zombie is the answer.  I would have talked to you about that.  Oh, shit.  I mean, I would have.  Did Tommy play for Zombie?  Oh, okay.  Because he was using, what's his name, Blasco, the bassist at one point, too?  Oh, I didn't realize he was a zombie drummer. 
[01:36:00]  He's fucking great, that guy.  Yep.  He is great.  Troy.  So you had one thing to say.  Are you going to talk about that on a loop?  I'm just saying.  That is true.  And Sam was bringing it back to his favorite singer, so he would have veered away from  my favorite people to Sam's favorite people.  You're making it about Sam, right?  And basically, I interviewed Rob Zombie with Sam there.  Not only did Sam not ever take me to see Sabbath, but I interviewed Sam to see his favorite  guy.  And my favorite band, Faith No More's drummer, played with Ozzy, so I would have talked to 
[01:36:30]  him about that.  He did talk about that.  Yeah, but he wasn't there.  It would have been a different deal.  Yeah, Mike Borden was not there.  I mean, that's just bringing up your favorite band for the sake of bringing up your favorite  band.  That's just selfish.  Yeah, but if we're talking about drummers from our favorite bands, I did the same thing.  It's selfish.  Well, I'll say Troy's opinion was valuable on the band's performance, because he's on  Liquid Metal, and he's a metal guy, and he's in a band, and he really does understand and  know that music, and he was talking about how great the drummer was. 
[01:37:00]  If only he understood the equipment as well as the music, it would have been a really great  week.  Well, if you didn't give me defaultive equipment...  First of all, defaultive is not a word.  Second of all...  Defaultive.  Was it defaultive when I handed it to you?  Was it?  You could tell the guys, was it when I gave it to you and you looked at it, was it defaultive?  No, but there was obviously something wrong with it, because all the other equipment...  Was it defaultive when I gave it to you?  Or did it become defaultive?  All the other equipment that I brought with me worked fine.  Did it become defaultive in your hands or my hands?  Just answer that, for the record. 
[01:37:30]  Just for the record.  Well, I don't know.  Whose hands did it become defaultive in?  This fight isn't fair, because Troy Kwan is very dehydrated.  Yeah, you're going to hear it.  He's thirsty.  You never went through what I went through this weekend, hauling that fucking equipment around  like that.  There was heavy equipment.  And it was hot.  Before we go to break, Jimmy, how about this?  I don't complain.  Your next trip...  Who would you rather have, Sam or Troy?  I've got to say, it depends on where I'm going and what the event is.  That's very well.  Because who knows if I'll bring either of them? 
[01:38:00]  Why should E-Rock be excluded from all the fun times?  Oh, God almighty.  That wouldn't work.  Oh, my God.  That would be terrible.  That would be a disaster.  Let me tell you.  Look at all the phone calls in the world.  There's no way E-Rock could have handled what happened.  Know what Jimmy just did?  These guys were pitted against each other.  Now they're joining forces to beat up E-Rock.  I'm just saying.  I mean, Troy's a good worker at the end of the day.  There's no way that E-Rock could handle a gym weekend.  Wow.  Never.  Hauling that equipment around in that fucking heat?  Are you kidding me?  You have to do an E-Rock weekend now.  You have to.  It's tempting because I do think. 
[01:38:30]  He'll lose his mind.  He'll go nuts, dude.  He will lose his fucking mind.  We'll be complaining about everything.  Could you handle the E-Rock?  You could.  I'm not fun to travel with, no.  I see.  He just defuses everything.  He's no fun.  You have to make sure that something has to get on the air while you're over wherever you are.  Like, so he has to send something.  He has to go through what Troy and me had to go through.  Why aren't you fun to travel with?  Yeah.  Because I need to be in comfort and entertained at all times.  You do, right?  Yeah. 
[01:39:00]  You hear he got all that money from NBC for the Olympics?  Of course I did.  Comfort and entertained.  He is.  In his mind, he's the talent.  Going out to that event like that.  And you're at his mercy, Jim.  Yeah.  Are you drunk?  E-Rock, I'll say it again, was made for America.  He is just the ultimate consumer.  Loves, loves consuming.  Just consuming everything and leaving nothing for anybody else.  No.  He's like a locust. 
[01:39:30]  He really is.  A swarm of locust.  He is America.  E-Rock should be on a poster.  Yeah.  An American flag and E-Rock.  What's the next gig?  I mean, it will be probably the Troy or Sam because they both technically did a good job with the equipment.  With what they had.  Because honestly, the equipment was set up perfectly for the Sabbath interview.  And nothing I've ever done is more important than that on the road to me.  But Sam did a great job with the UFC shit.  You know, he was there.  You've got to pick one.  You've got to pick one before break.  Depends on where I'm going.  I don't think that's fair.  No, I have to because if it's a music thing, I would go with Troy because he's probably my producer on the Boneyard. 
[01:40:00]  And that was why I originally, I flew us out on miles.  Because I was going to take Troy to see Sabbath because he fucking produced my Boneyard show every day.  Sure.  For no extra money.  And does a great job.  You know what I mean?  The fucking thing is he can do for him.  Why would you take Sam then?  What event would you take Sam to?  I have fun with Sam on the road.  Sam does a good job with Chip.  Sam does a good job.  Sam gets Chip.  Troy doesn't, right?  I'm sure Troy does.  Troy asked me to do some Chip.  Well, I wanted to go do Chip at Lollapalooza. 
[01:40:30]  I was just too out of it.  I couldn't do it.  I couldn't do Chip at Lollapalooza.  That was Sabbath.  And you didn't have a video camera.  No, exactly.  Well, we did.  We had two.  We got a multi-camera shoot for Sabbath.  That is true.  So in a panic, we figured it out.  We got the fault of equipment.  The fault of, yeah.  You wouldn't have figured out the two-camera iPhone shoot.  Are you kidding me?  You wouldn't have figured that out, Sam.  There's never been a problem on a Sam and Jim trip.  You admitted that.  You're not good at troubleshooting.  When I'm there?  That camera would have just sat in your pocket.  You wouldn't have been able to figure out that you could have used it there. 
[01:41:00]  I'm what they call a problem solver to the level that Jim would never even realize there was a problem.  But here's why I love Troy.  Oh, Sam.  And this is a big one.  This is a big one.  Go ahead, Sam.  My original plan was for Troy and I to go see Sabbath, to fly in Friday at 1.  You know, I got the hotel rooms on points for one night, or I paid like $2.30 for both rooms combined.  It was really cheap.  So we'll go see Black Sabbath and come home Saturday morning. 
[01:41:30]  And Troy said, why don't you interview them?  And I'm like, I didn't even think of that.  And I always want to be around them.  He's thinking show.  So you're saying Sam would not have thought that.  I only interviewed Sabbath and had that amazing weekend experience because of Troy.  You hear that?  You know what I said to Troy after he said that, though?  I said you just made yourself a lot busier this weekend.  That's a lot more work.  Oh, see what you do, though, Sam?  And that's okay. 
[01:42:00]  Because Jim did the only Black Sabbath interview in America.  So, I mean, that's fucking great.  And it's going to air here on SiriusXM.  I felt bad that it couldn't air beforehand.  But again, that's just, that was a...  Well, pieces of it have been airing throughout the weekend.  Just clips.  Yeah, but we're going to air the full interview sometime this week.  All I want to hear is fucking, we just did it because it was you.  That's all it matters.  That's all it matters.  Were you bros on the trip?  Did you bro down?  I think we had a couple bro moments. 
[01:42:30]  What was one of the bro moments?  We just had good conversations, just talked.  Ah, a little talking, bro.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  Talked, talked, everything.  Sam, sorry, I'm getting more info, and I apologize.  I'm just, you know...  You're the reporter.  That's all I'm trying to do.  I understand that.  I'm not picking sides.  Steven Philly says Sam didn't upload the UFC show until he was back in New York City,  and after that Monday.  Oh, man.  He's an idiot.  You are a piece of shit.  It aired the Saturday before the pay-per-view.  Oh, it did. 
[01:43:00]  Sam's right.  It did.  And then it replayed because I organized a replay of it.  Damn it!  Any other comments?  Yes, I do.  I have one.  Oh, yes.  It's Troy.  Sam never sat in first class with Jim.  Oh, Sam.  That hurts.  That hurts.  I sat going in first class with Jim.  That hurts.  But Jim said he was going with you as a treat because you do his Boneyard show for free.  Yeah.  I don't produce anything for Jim for free.  Well, technically, all that video editing I do for Chip is for free, so I would like a  first class seat at some point. 
[01:43:30]  Well, here's the reason we went first class.  We didn't go first class coming back.  Oh, one way first class is not.  Because it was more than you got, motherfucker.  Oh, man.  Because the miles, it didn't cost me that many miles.  It was a comparable miles trip.  But coming back, it would have been a lot more expensive in miles, so I said, fuck that.  We'll come back, coach.  And then when I was there, I upgraded myself for like $190 to first.  I didn't realize I could do that.  Oh, nice.  Plus, Jim and I usually do cross-country trips, not just quick flights to Chicago.  Yeah, and the company normally flies Sam. 
[01:44:00]  I don't fly Sam.  The company does because we're actually on...  It's just a different setup.  But you'll understand more of the details, Troy, when you do a couple more trips.  But I will upgrade Sam to first with my miles on the trip.  I will do that because I don't want to be unfair, and Sam has done some good trips with me.  But Troy eats like a gentleman.  That must have been nice to actually be able to sit down and...  Had a nice piece of steak.  Yeah.  I've never been a problem to eat with him.  Didn't have to get chicken fingers.  You know what I mean?  I didn't get chicken fingers.  Right, Jim?  Well, I will say this...  Jim wasn't embarrassed by your ordering. 
[01:44:30]  He didn't get embarrassed by my ordering.  No, I would say that Sam has the chicken Christopher when we go out to Morton's.  And if you didn't know Sam, you wouldn't know that he was a coddled, finicky douche.  Yeah, right.  He's fine.  I never noticed.  And he never says, let's not go here.  He really doesn't burden everyone else.  No.  I've noticed that over the years.  Not at all.  I don't complain.  I don't make excuses.  I can't say the same about Troy.  There's no excuses.  You've made a few excuses just here today.  About what?  Camera, FTP, da-da-da.  Jim was a witness to all that. 
[01:45:00]  I mean, just because he's a witness doesn't mean you didn't make excuses.  I still made shit happen.  Sort of.  It still got recorded with video and audio.  I can't wait to hear it on the air.  I wish I'd heard it on Fridays.  It's on the air.  It was just a little later getting to them.  That's all.  I did this thing on Friday, and I was like, oh, I can't wait to hear the...  Oh.  Are you saying it would have been more powerful if the Black Sabbath interview aired before Lollapalooza?  That was why I suggested to put the UFC special the Saturday of the pay-per-view.  Even though it was more work for me, I said, this is really when it's going to mean something. 
[01:45:30]  And it aired, which was nice.  Yeah.  And I also exercise with gym.  Have you ever done that?  We've done a lot of walking.  Ah, yeah, yeah.  I can't see you two hitting the gym.  No.  We can hit the gym.  We'll hit the gym next time.  Yeah.  Like with Troy, I can see him being a motivator, you know.  Yeah.  Go to the gym.  I'm back in the gym.  That's nice.  Just tired of my fucking awfulness.  Eating a lot of pretzels.  That's good.  It's so hard.  Pretzels aren't bad, though.  Jim and I have been to Haagen-Dazs together.  Have you? 
[01:46:00]  I mean, we were all over the place together.  Not to Haagen-Dazs, though, right?  Yeah, we did go to Haagen-Dazs together.  That was nice.  And I ordered one scoop and ate half of it and threw the rest out like a big boy.  Aw.  I had lactose farts the entire drive home.  Yeah, it was bad.  Well, me and Jim were swimming on Saturday.  Yes, we were.  Just hanging out, talking like men in the pool.  That's nice.  It was great.  I ate some Tostitos.  Tostitos and some baked chips.  What's that?  I like going to Ann's house because I always feel healthy when I do that. 
[01:46:30]  Like, I'm just going to hang out with a friend.  It's always late at night.  Yeah, it's always after your debauchery.  After my shows.  After your debauchery.  If I do the cellar, I'll be done by like 10, 30, 11 o'clock.  Like, it feels like a nice, healthy thing to do to go out and hang with a friend and not  be a pervert and just sit there and eat a burger or whatever and chit-chat.  Although all we discuss is horrific, perverted stuff.  Yeah, we did talk a lot about cunt.  It was a lot of pussy chatter.  A lot of pussy chit-chat.  Need it.  Got it.  Need it.  Got it.  Need it.  Yeah, it was pretty funny. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, boy.  That sialis is piping up again.  He's patting his cock.  Yay, weenie.  We should go to break if he's patting his cock.  But overall, a fun trip.  I'm kind of bummed you didn't pick between these two because you have no idea what that  would start behind the scenes.  Well, I don't know what our next trip is, so I can't pick because if I pick Troy and  then the next trip is an obvious Sam strength.  Right now you're feeling Troy over Sam.  I would assume because it's still fresh in your mind.  By the way, he had to spend only a little bit of time with Troy. 
[01:47:30]  Jim and I have spent days together and it's always been good.  You hear how he said that?  That sounds like it's a hassle, how he said days.  It's never been a hassle.  It's always been a fun trip.  Why did he go days?  Because it's a considerable amount of time to spend with a person.  And we could have spent days together.  He probably would have gotten tired of you soon, though.  Jim and I did have a lot of cunt talk as well, which he probably doesn't have with  you.  Probably not as much cunt.  Wait, Sam, why would Jim tire of Troy quickly?  He could trigger things Austin.  Why, why?  You understand.  I mean, you talk to him.  No, I don't.  I'm just a reporter.  Why?  Yeah, no.  Troy gets very exhausting. 
[01:48:00]  Why?  Why are you exhausting?  Why?  Give us an example.  Because he's always on.  He's always doing this Troy thing.  I'm the wife of the party, motherfucker.  Yeah, bro.  The party, dude.  I'm not 40, asshole.  Da, da, da.  And do you think Jimmy will get annoyed by that?  Eventually, Jim will be like, all right.  If it was a...  I just want to have...  Just hang out.  If it was a little longer trip?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Troy would have gotten tiring.  Yeah.  Any longer than their trip, Troy would have been a little bit tiring.  A little bit much.  That's not true.  Troy's good in incremental doses.  Oh, man. 
[01:48:30]  Not like...  You know, we did like a Wednesday to Sunday trip.  That couldn't have been done with Troy.  No.  That's bullshit.  He would have just been annoyed with him.  Jim and I would have had a blast.  Yeah.  We would have gone out fucking partying.  No, by the end of Friday, it would have been like, oh, Jesus, there's another day with  this guy.  Whereas with me and Jim, it's like, oh, cool.  You know?  Oh, I'll see Sam tomorrow.  That's great.  Well, I've got to plan the next trip.  I don't know what the next event is.  You've got to bring E-Rock.  That I would bring E-Rock.  I would do something with E-Rock.  Again, I wouldn't do anything that meant as much to me as Sabbath. 
[01:49:00]  Why not?  Don't trust him.  Thank you.  I love E-Rock, but I think that he's...  Inept?  A buffoon?  Unrient?  Don't fat?  Yeah, I mean...  None of you could be sued for slander.  You're all right.  Lazy, consuming.  Oh, wow.  So what about a UFC event?  E-Rock had a UFC event.  Oh, boy.  He's thinking way too long.  Hard to say, because Sam was really on the money with the camera and filming the interviews. 
[01:49:30]  And Bobby Kelly did that one, too.  Bobby was very good with that one, too.  Bobby starts shooting his new series today, by the way.  Good luck, Bobby.  Congratulations to Bobby.  Oh, yes, Bobby.  I mean, I know reading the guys.  I know all of them at UFC.  Yeah.  You do.  You've been around them, though.  E-Rock would have been too concerned with getting his own autographs.  Right.  Oh.  He would have been like, hey, Jim, before you talk to Black Sabbath, is it cool if I asked  him to sign this poster for me?  For my cousin.  I have six action figures for my nephew and a DVD for my wife?  Right, right, right.  Yeah, that probably would have been a daughter.  That happens?  Oh, all the time.  Oh, I didn't know. 
[01:50:00]  No, yeah, all the time.  Yeah.  Just being a reporter.  Maybe I wouldn't bring E-Rock.  I don't know.  Just reporting.  I just got to decide where to go next.  And maybe Sam and Troy could suggest trips.  Because let's say this.  It is a fun...  I know it's fun to go away, especially when you're going on a company day.  It's fun to go.  I get used to it because I travel for stand-up, but these guys don't get to just leave on a  Friday.  No, pretty fun, right?  Miss a show and travel and not have to be here.  Yeah.  Like in this building.  Oh, these people.  Yeah.  We know who you're talking about. 
[01:50:30]  Not you guys.  Those people, you know.  Yeah, we got you.  You enjoy a good trip out, right?  Yeah, I hate being here.  All right.  I think we did it.  Sounds like you guys had a good time.  We did, man.  It was fun.  Good for Jimmy.  Oh, when's the special?  That's what we should get out there.  Black Sabbath interviewing.  Oh, I don't know.  It'll be on the Boneyard.  It's supposed to be Friday, but who knows?  Why is it?  We should air it here, too.  I just don't know if people would like it.  We have to produce it, I guess.  I just don't know if people would enjoy it.  I mean, I always assume...  Maybe a different version for this channel. 
[01:51:00]  I don't know.  There's got to be some stuff in there.  But it was only 15 minutes, so...  Oh, yeah.  Well, sure.  It's quick and easy, but yeah, we could definitely do it.  Yeah, we should.  All right.  We'll figure that out.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Yay.  I don't even want to talk. 
[01:51:30]  We're back.  It's all I want to do is listen.  Oh, it's one of those loops.  Oh, it's a loopy loop.  What are you doing?  See, that's what he would do if you took him on a trip.  Y-Rock, why?  Fuck something.  Why?  This isn't terrestrial.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Fucking play the song. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, boy.  Y-Rock, what happened?  Why?  I threw the Rejourner on.  Now the song's playing.  All right.  Turn the Rejourner off.  We don't need the Rejourner.  This is the song.  Rejourner.  I know, but you had the Rejourner.  But now it's 40 times the same bar.  You just turn it off.  You reckon, savagely.  Oh, it's just ruined.  It's ruined.  Let's not forget, we're going to be in Chicago on Friday.  Yes.  We pretty much promoted it, right?  We're good.  We've got to promote hard this week.  You think?  Yeah. 
[01:52:30]  I hope people come.  It's this Friday, 115 Bourbon Street, which is on West 115 Street in Marionette Park.  And we're going to be there.  It says 3 to 5.  We will be there earlier and probably after.  So just come down.  Doors open around 2.  It's going to be fun.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  We have the oddest thing you own.  You've got to bring stuff down.  There's a $1,000 cash prize, whatever the oddest thing you own is.  And we're going to do Chip Off the Old Block, which is a chip impersonation contest. 
[01:53:00]  And I'm curious about Chip's look, too, because I'm about to animate Chip.  And I want to know what people think.  Someone's going to spark an idea in me.  And worst breath, judged by our own E-Rock, there's a $500 cash prize.  Wow.  How fucking, the thing that has tortured you, your shitty fucking tartar breath, that rotten  plaque breath, that every time you go to kiss a girl, you have to chew gum, and even through  the gum, it smells like tartar, it smells like wintergreen tartar breath. 
[01:53:30]  Tartar.  So at least you can make $500 and go get a good cleaning.  Right.  There you go.  Get a good cleaning.  You don't have to give your last name.  You're on the radio.  Don't forget, you can fuck up your breath, too.  Fuck it up, too.  Just for the event.  Yeah, but if you have naturally rotten breath, show up with your fucking dead tooth and your  fucking plaque and tartar breath and blow it in stupid's face and walk out with $500.  Are you a fan of the dead tooth?  Fucking, it's disgusting, that rotted thing just hanging in your mouth. 
[01:54:00]  It's like leaving a corpse in the living room.  Go to the dentist, you fucking shitbag.  But you know what?  It's great that we're going to do that, and I think it's going to be a fun show.  And Travis just told me another suggestion.  We may have the wiener girls.  What are they, the wiener people?  There's this place in Chicago called the Wiener Circle.  Yeah.  And I guess they're famous.  Ah, I get it.  They're famous for their waitresses insulting the customers.  Wieners?  Yeah, exactly.  The customers insulting back.  Oh, wow. 
[01:54:30]  Really?  Yeah, so.  I hate those places.  I know a really good food.  Just give me my food.  I don't want to have to fucking do anything.  Oh, you don't like that?  No.  Sounds great.  They better not tangle with me.  I'll just insult them right back.  Hot dogs, why don't you serve cold cats?  What?  Forget about it.  Isn't there another restaurant that just gives you horrible service?  They kind of just throw the food at you and crap, and I guess that's just supposed  to be fun for everyone.  I know what I'm doing.  What?  Bring them down.  I'm going to insult them. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  That'll be fun.  That's going to be a ball.  You could, yeah, what would you say, though?  I don't even care.  Hot dogs.  Why are they so hot?  What, are you putting matches on their feet or something?  That's a good one.  Yeah, I know it is.  I'm sure the wiener girls are awesome.  I'm just not a fan of that type of shit.  They go toe-to-toe with Chip, I think.  They're going to walk away.  That could be good, right?  Yeah, they're going to walk away with their fucking pussies hanging out. 
[01:55:30]  Huh?  Conan, Conan, Conan, Conan, who the barbarian?  Fucking home run, Chipperson.  Go to break, you rock.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  This Friday, August 10th, there's a live fucking broadcast coming up from Chicago.  Be there and experience a special afternoon live broadcast with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  Doors open at 2 p.m. Central.  Show starts at 3. 
[01:56:00]  Get there early, because space is limited.  Hey, you want some Chicago beat this pizza?  If you can't join us in person, listen to it live on the Opie and Anthony channel.  Opie and Anthony!  Opie and Anthony!  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sorry about that.  Chip feels like he can produce the show from time to time.  That's just when there's a big laugh like that, you let people go with it.  We just took a break, and we came back for a minute, and then you put us back into a break. 
[01:56:30]  Let people breathe.  I don't know about that.  I don't think they appreciated that.  Someone said, are you kidding me?  I officially hate go to break, Chip.  Go to break, Chip.  Yeah, go to break, Chip.  It stinks.  How long were we back before Chip brought us back into the commercials and shit?  Two minutes.  Two minutes tops. 
[01:57:00]  Where were we?  I don't even remember.  We were talking about the Chicago broadcast.  Oh, the Chicago broadcast.  Right.  I'm psyched to go out there just to...  Well, we got a couple of little activities planned.  Willis Tower.  We're going to Willis Tower, I think.  I'm doing Willis Tower.  I don't know if I'm doing the ride along.  What you talking about?  I want to do that.  I want to do Willis Tower, though.  I want to eat dinner and do the ride along.  Can we, like, lean off the side of the building and all that crap?  Is that up there?  Yeah, right?  Those little boxes?  You can actually sit on top of the box.  I want to do the thing.  Oh, no.  That's the CN Tower in Toronto. 
[01:57:30]  Oh.  The Willis Tower.  They don't have anything you can lean over the side?  No.  Oh, that stinks.  I just think it'll be fun.  I've never been to Chicago either, so I have no clue.  It's a great city, man.  It's a fucking great city.  Aesthetically, and the place we're staying is great.  All these years, and we've never been to Chicago.  I want to go to Shea Louise.  What is that?  Do you want to do that?  Oh, is that a...  I thought it?  No.  Oh, no.  First Bueller.  Oh, should we do the first...  That's gotta be so hack.  It has to be, right?  Oh, yeah.  It must be. 
[01:58:00]  What?  Are you talking about the art museum?  Yeah, doing all that.  Yeah.  I'm sure they have, like, an...  Are you doing that?  No, somebody on staff wanted to do that badly.  Oh, I bet I know.  Why is E-Rock grabbing the mic?  E-Rock, what do you want to go to the art museum for?  You're fucking crazy.  He wants to take the picture, doesn't he?  Oh, no.  Of course.  E-Rock wants to go.  E-Rock wanted to go to the Ferris Bueller, the art museum they went to.  He was talking about it on Friday.  That's one of the I can't wait to.  How douchey. 
[01:58:30]  I don't go to Chicago, so it's fun to do.  Oh!  You fucking buried his cocksucker.  Take us out, E-Rock.  You're listening to Opinality.  Sirius XM.  Summer Games Radio is on.

XM.  This is the Opinality Show.  All right, we're back.  Chip, you just can't do that anymore, Chip.  I'm sorry, I can't help, but the laughs are just flying around his place.  Yeah. 
[01:59:30]  You're welcome.  Yeah, yeah.  You're welcome.  I guess Chip's producing the show now.  Thanks.  Hey, do we got any of that iced tea in the can?  Oh.  I want a fucking can of that shit.  Nest tea?  Brisk.  Oh, you got the brisk?  I want some cold brisk.  And a new cup of ice.  Yeah, bitches.  I'm rocking it.  NBC apologizes for poorly timed monkey gymnastics promo after Gabby Douglas.  I think acknowledging this at all is more racist than dumb.  Isn't it amazing that they have to apologize? 
[02:00:00]  That it has to be acknowledged.  It's a commercial.  It wasn't made.  The commercial wasn't made, so it's like, let's fucking do something horribly racist and make this commercial.  And then air it right after a black Olympian does something.  And some of these news shows and Twitter are certainly a debate whether NBC is racist or not.  Are you kidding me?  You can't figure out that it was an unfortunate coincidence?  Not even unfortunate.  Why is it so fucking bad to play that spot after Gabby Douglas won? 
[02:00:30]  I said unfortunate coincidence, and you're right.  It's just a coincidence.  That's how I should have said that.  You're absolutely right.  It's just one of those things.  How did it go down?  I haven't even seen it yet.  I guess Bob Costas was talking about African-American girl winning.  I like to be shy on African-American girls out there who tonight are saying to themselves,  hey, I'd like to try that too.  More from London in a moment. 
[02:01:00]  And then they go away.  His entire life has been leading at this moment out of the hard work, the dedication, just to answer the call.  He's adorable.  The call of victory.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  The monkey's adorable.  But they completely, they timed that out in advance.  They don't make commercial decisions as the event's happening.  They know when they're going to run that before the show starts. 
[02:01:30]  Well, someone in a control room is thinking, oh, fuck, I know what's queued up next.  This is not good.  But probably they were in a spot where it was too late to change it.  They shouldn't have to.  I don't even think so, because it was just an off-the-cuff thing that Bob Costas did.  But you've got to understand, if you're NBC, there will be people that will take this very seriously and will think it's very insensitive.  I think it's more insensitive and offensive to acknowledge it.  Like, anybody that would have made that correlation is really racist and fucking twisted anyway. 
[02:02:00]  So why fucking, why give them the fucking satisfaction by even acknowledging it?  You know?  As a comedy piece, it's kind of funny.  Oh, fuck yeah, but believe me.  No, I'm cracking up, but, and the monkey's merely adorable.  Monkeys are fucking funny as shit when they're doing things like that.  You know why they're always monkeying around?  No, no, they're not.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That wasn't very funny.  That wasn't very funny at all.  It's gotta be funny.  Chip, you gotta realize some of the stuff isn't that funny. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bullshit.  Yeah.  Please don't take us to break again.  Please don't do that, Chip.  We'll have to hear from the bosses.  I don't let that, I don't know.  Why would you do that?  I don't, I understand.  Do you think that's really going to, like, keep your listeners?  I think that's a tune-out.  Shut it.  What are those monkeys doing?  Probably eating a bunch of banana daiquiris.  Banana daiquiris?  Go to... 
[02:03:00]  No, no, no.  Whoa, whoa.  I don't think Edgar's allowed to produce the program.  No, no, no.  I think the ship is either.  No, no.  No, no.  You can't have fun.  So why is NBC apologizing?  I guess they have to in a way, right?  Just to kind of calm people down.  They didn't have to.  But it's stupid.  It's so stupid.  It's just a coincidence.  Did they apologize?  I think so.  NBC denies any racial offense was meant by Olympic monkey promo.  How do you acknowledge that without sounding racist?  But I think they threw in a little, like, if you were offended by that, whatever. 
[02:03:30]  What are you going to do?  That wasn't our intentions.  I think that's how it kind of went down.  Do we have the apologies somewhere?  That's just something that...  I hope they didn't.  Yeah, I hope they didn't either.  All right.  Connor.  Yeah, mother...  I remember Connor.  We're trying to build that one up, right?  I would not have remembered his name.  Why?  He's the one that needs a little self-confidence.  I had no idea what his name was.  I guess that's not helping.  Me not remembering his name. 
[02:04:00]  What's NBC's statement, Sam?  I thought we had it.  Let's see.  In the light of E-Rock extorting us for money after the...  Do we have that story?  It says, the spot-promoting animal practice, which has run three times previously, is one  in a series with an Olympic theme, which have been scheduled for maximum exposure.  Certainly no offense was intended.  Okay.  That's okay.  That's fine.  And the odds that a black gymnast was going to win before that, because I think she was 
[02:04:30]  basically the only one I saw, they probably weren't thinking this would ever be a problem.  Do you have to apologize for something that only ridiculous racists would even fucking  think about?  I mean, honestly.  No, they didn't have...  But they acknowledged it.  Well, the sensitive culture we live in, though, of course they had to say something.  It's fucking ridiculous.  Say something.  I'm not...  Of course they shouldn't have.  It's ridiculous.  There's no surprise here that they would kind of try to figure something out.  If everybody wants to live in this world all nice and equal and everything, you shouldn't 
[02:05:00]  have to call out things like that.  Whatever it is.  What about the Gooks of Hazard t-shirt?  What is that?  Oh, yeah.  Backlash over Asian slur t-shirt.  A major skateboard company is being accused of putting racism for sale after selling a  shirt featuring two Asian men under the words, man, Gooks of Hazard.  That's just...  That's not even, like, very funny.  I mean, you're just asking for problems.  Asian guys getting in a little... 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  The reason they thought it was okay was because one of the Asian guys on the shirt is the  skater for who the shirt is.  Oh, really?  So he thought, if I'm Asian...  Then, yeah, you know what?  I could say Gooks of Hazard.  In the weird rules we live in, yeah, it should be okay then.  Yeah.  Yeah, but then you got white people wearing a shirt that says Gooks of Hazard.  But if the one guy is in it and he gave his okay for the shirt, what's the problem?  Black people can obviously wear shirts with nigga on it.  Yeah, but if I walked in here just with a shirt that said, like, who kid is my nigga or something 
[02:06:00]  like that on it.  I would throw you into Shade Station just watching punch the shit out of you.  Yeah, but I don't know...  I know why they're getting shit for this.  I mean, it's just, it's, you know, it's one of those things that you have to, how can they  not expect it?  And the car is called General Lee.  A lie.  Oh, General Lee.  And it's his...  It's horrible.  Good or boys.  Good or...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Or boys.  O-R-R.  Good or boys.  Right.  Well, and one of the skaters is Asian, so that's featured in the t-shirt. 
[02:06:30]  Oh.  And this skater, I don't know him, the Nuge, I guess, he approves of the shirt.  The Asian American Justice Center feels differently.  A rep for the organization, it's unacceptable for Baker Skateboards to create a depiction  of Asian Americans which uses racial slurs and perpetuates racist stereotypes.  What's this stereotype?  Oh.  Oh, the language.  And the outlets that sell the shirt should be aware that use of the term gook on their 
[02:07:00]  apparel is offensive and quite simply amounts to racism for sale.  No one should seek to profit from racism.  Racism, racism, racism.  Boy, is that the...  Well, it's not as crazy as I first thought, though, because I didn't realize one of the  skaters is Asian.  Yeah.  You know, that's a real guy.  And he said it was cool.  Huh?  They probably still don't like it.  No, of course not.  Doesn't matter.  Of course not. 
[02:07:30]  Isn't that just a Vietnam term anyway?  Old Vietnam term?  Is that like conky?  Is it old school?  It is old school.  It's fucking from the 60s.  Where does that word come from?  Do you know?  It became popular during Vietnam?  Yeah, yeah.  For the North Vietnamese and the...  Why that word, though?  Viet Cong?  I'm even scared to say it.  Viet Cong.  Let's see where it came from.  Why that word?  Origin and development?  What's the origin of the word?  Hmm.  Ah.  Well, a slang dictionary published in 1893 defined it as a low prostitute. 
[02:08:00]  Hmm.  Uh, by using the word to refer to Filipinos, the Marines may have been expressing contempt  for native women.  Oh, really?  Hmm.  Gugu is a mocking imitation of Filipino speech.  Hmm.  Could have been something from that, they're saying.  I'm not buying that one.  No.  So what is it? 
[02:08:30]  They don't really know where it came from?  There's a lot of possibilities.  And they shouldn't make fun of their speech, because they speak very well.  So that's not fair.  Right?  Sure.  Yeah.  Stuff is wrong with how they speak.  Uh, it referred, uh, uh, folk etymology suggests that it refers to the Korean word  meaning country.  Country?  I wish I had one of those in my backyard.  What?  No one's following that.  No, no, no.  We're going to follow it.  No, no, no, no.  We're going to follow it as long as we have to. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  Believe me.  Not funny.  No.  That wasn't really one to go to break with.  Yeah, it wasn't.  Go to the bunch of commercials consecutively.  Oh.  Well, we'll never know.  Is Tiger Woods just on TV?  Yeah.  Mike Douglas had a great show.  Mike Douglas.  Mike Douglas interviewed everybody.  Yeah.  The young Tiger.  Tiger Woods, when he was two years old, was that Mike Douglas? 
[02:09:30]  Was he two at the time?  Two.  And he was playing golf.  Playing golf.  Yeah.  Yeah, but he was using plastic clubs.  Oh, yeah.  What an asshole.  And he could only drive it like 20 yards.  Yeah, that was terrible.  That's kind of dumb.  So right now, I'm like to meet Tiger Woods and his father Earl Woods.  That's Bob Hope.  I've never seen it before.  With Bob Hope.  Yeah.  Look at the whole Tiger Woods.  What year is this?  Oh, 2007. 
[02:10:00]  Okay.  He's like Rodney Allen Rippey.  What year was this?  2007.  Oh, 2007.  Wow.  It went nowhere.  Stupid.  He looks like little Tiger Woods.  How old are you, Tiger?  Tiny.  Two.  Two?  Ah, ha, ha.  Hey, look at him.  There's a longer clip where Bob Hope gets into it a little bit.  Hey, he doesn't look all colored to me. 
[02:10:30]  Wow.  Hey, what do you got a mix there?  Ah?  Bet your wife got a jungle fever?  He said something like, I don't know what kind of drugs that kid's on, but I'll have some  or something like that.  Yeah, yeah.  He went with it.  Brad in Baltimore wants to help us out with that word that was on that t-shirt.  I'm scared of saying it.  Gook.  Where's gook from, sir?  Brad in Baltimore.  I was just joking.  Korean for person.  I can say it.  What?  Korean for person. 
[02:11:00]  Korean for person.  Is it really?  That was one of the...  So what's the problem?  Gook is a real word?  So why is there a problem?  I don't understand why the problem is.  I think it just sounds like it.  That's what we were saying before.  I was teaching English over there, and what I heard was that the term me gook is the term  for American, and so after the Korean War, Korean guys were coming up to American voters  and saying, me gook, me gook, and then the Americans thought they were saying, oh, this guy's saying his name is gook.  Oh, me a gook. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Yeah.  Oh, that just sounds...  How cute Tiger was.  Oh, he was adorable.  That fucking...  Look at you, guys.  I was watching Mike Douglas clips, and man, did he have some awkward TV.  Oh, yeah, definitely.  Like when Sly and the Family Stone was on with Muhammad Ali, like Sly was his co-host, and  the fucking Ali's in the middle, and he doesn't want Sly clowning, because Ali was...  This was right before he fought Foreman, so he was Nation of Islam's Sirius Ali. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, boy.  And Sly was just clowning, and Ali kept saying, I'm not here to clown.  You could see that Ali wanted to fucking knock his fucking head off.  But Mike Douglas just went with it.  He didn't give a fuck.  Three, getting pretty.  Really, and Mariam, she's six.  Muhammad Ali is two.  Your son is two?  It's really something to watch him grow and getting big, and my little daughter Mariam,  I had her out not long ago. 
[02:12:30]  About a couple years ago, before she started talking, one or two words they'll say, and  one day you'll wake up, she'll say something like, you know, ask you a question.  I had a friend with me, and she was sleeping.  I said, we had a suite in a hotel in New York, and a lawyer friend came up, and I said, I want  some peace.  So I told her to go to bed.  She said she was asleep.  She kept faking, but she wasn't asleep.  Fast forward a little to you.  Because Sly is sitting next to him.  What the hell is Muhammad Ali talking about?  Jesus.  I was being hypnotized by him. 
[02:13:00]  Sly just keeps Joe jumping in.  Anyone else hear Patrice O'Neal?  When Patrice used to be soft-spoken?  No?  Just me?  Yeah.  All right.  Fair enough.  We have a lot of fellas standing on the corner, you know, imitating Sly, all the temptations  of Elvis Presley.  But it's a possibility they may never make it.  And if he takes this as a trade, you don't feel that life's a tragedy.  I'll tell you something that I know you're aware of.  I've watched a lot of young guys in boxing now, in amateur boxing, who are doing you. 
[02:13:30]  You know, doing them a lot.  The Ali shot.  Ray Robinson was there.  There's a point where Sly just keeps jumping in.  Where are we?  Is this from part?  No, go to part one, Sam.  I'm sorry.  I didn't tell you that.  I didn't realize you were part two.  How does Mike Douglas have these guys on his show?  Ali and Sly?  No, go to part one, Mike Douglas, Ali.  Because you can see how awkward it is.  The show, and I thought, like, wow, we've done some awkward interviews, but Mike Douglas  really just allowed it to be awkward.  Yes.  And Sly is obviously drunk and just keeps interrupting Ali. 
[02:14:00]  And he won't.  And you can see Ali wants to fucking drive his elbow into Sly's face.  Because Sly is all dressed up like a pimp.  And Ali is tired of black people being treated a certain way on TV.  And just got to just run and fast forward through a little bit until they're actually  talking, sweetie pie.  All right.  I'm sure you can go in there somewhere.  Yeah, there you go.  Because I am in trouble.  We have so many problems in the world, and these shows are not getting on yourself.  Just leave you out. 
[02:14:30]  But in general, these shows are so phony.  Yeah.  Everybody's laughing.  That's right.  That's right.  Everything is a laugh here in America.  That's right.  Nobody's serious.  People hungry.  But it ain't my...  All kind of trouble.  And kiki, kiki, kiki, kiki.  That's right.  And the black entertainers, kiki, kiki, kiki, kiki.  That's right.  That's right.  You too.  Black entertainers, kiki, kiki.  Oh, man.  That's right.  Is there an echo in here?  No, I'm with it.  I'm with it.  I'm just saying, you know, sometimes, you know, I think we should use this stuff to get attention 
[02:15:00]  for things.  You know, I played a lot, and I clowned a lot.  Okay.  You got a platform.  No, I'm just saying, this is why I'm not always...  How many times that girl's doing all this, they're crazy for audiences, TV, everything  is so good.  He makes a lot of money, I make a lot of money, but his brothers and uncles of mine  are catching hell and hungry, and we're on TV, he-he-he, like everything is so rosy. 
[02:15:30]  And I can't go off of that guilty.  There's too many wise people.  Muhammad.  Oh, man.  I'm talking now, man.  The only thing we can do for brothers is to do what we're doing, be examples, and to  be he-he-he happy, and to be intelligent, like you are.  Oh, man.  And like you always say.  Thank you.  All right, he just goes, thank you. 
[02:16:00]  He's so mad at us.  We don't have to smash him.  Wow, you can tell me.  I'm going to do something for intelligent to debate with the brother on television, you  know, or even clown with him on television, but behind the doors, we can have a good time,  but not with all the people.  Yeah, we can.  Yeah, we can.  Wait a minute.  Now, wait.  If we didn't, we'd be phony.  Now, wait a minute.  That's not being honest, what you just said.  That's what I'm saying.  We'd be phony.  Clown behind doors.  We'd be phony if we didn't do the same thing out here that we do.  No, no.  You just said clown.  I said if I had any clown around, don't you agree with me? 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, we're going to clown around.  If you don't like it, I'm going to whoop you.  How would you, getting serious for a moment, we were talking about the karate thing, and  I've asked many fighters, how would a top-notch boxer like yourself manage with a guy who  wouldn't fight?  I think they wouldn't fight.  Let him go.  They wouldn't fight.  Not Muhammad.  I told him he's finished.  Oh.  Always remember that.  They would not fight. 
[02:17:00]  I'm telling you the truth.  A good, Muhammad and a good karate man would not fight.  Karate man.  Let him answer his side.  Just for, how would you manage?  White man doing that.  Does it mean?  But I'm your co-host.  Yeah.  Half the action's mine.  Now, how would they fare?  I mentioned the co-host on Change of Subject.  I've been offered this show to co-host Johnny Carson.  How uncomfortable is this?  Oh, my God.  This is horribly uncomfortable. 
[02:17:30]  Until I can have who I want on the show, talk about what we want to talk about.  But I told you you could do that.  Oh, it won't be a show.  Hold it now.  Let me say it.  Okay.  But I'm going to say this.  The question.  What was the question?  You can't have who you want on the show.  I had who I wanted to show you.  Top-notch fighter.  You won't look at him.  A fighter.  And a karate man.  A fighter wouldn't stand in charge.  Karate man.  Bleed on the inside.  One or two things he can do is ball his fist up and through a jet with karate, man. 
[02:18:00]  It's jumping and kicking and falling down.  It's too much.  It's too much.  He's grabbing all his arm.  Put your hockey clown on television.  I clown backstage.  Oh, does he want to kill him?  The people's champ.  That's right.  That's right.  The people's champ.  Wow.  Oh, is this uncomfortable.  From time to time, we've talked about your training camp.  Can the public attend when you're training?  Yes.  We have training sessions every day. 
[02:18:30]  Two o'clock.  Mike Douglas just keeps on going.  He doesn't try to make it all better.  He allows it to be awkward.  Yeah.  There's something to be said for that.  We seat about 250 people a day.  It's real antique.  We have big 50-ton.  I don't know karate.  I know crazy.  I don't know all the great fighters.  No.  I'm crazy.  You ain't bullshit.  You know what to do, fat boy. 
[02:19:00]  No, no, no.  There's nothing to do.  We're good.  There's nothing to do.  Wow.  I'm going to have to watch the rest of that.  That would have been perfect.  Yeah, Jesus.  That's a rock.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  He's busy.  He's taking a big fetch.  Shit.  He loves those big...  He's busy, Sam?  What is he busy with?  He's a little busy.  Well, SummerSlam's coming up.  He's writing a fantasy card right now. 
[02:19:30]  He's doing some fan fictions.  Oh, a little fan fiction.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He makes WWE fan fictions while the show's on.  He loves that fan fiction.  Well, he just wishes things were his way.  Yeah.  Like they are in life.  Everything goes E-Roc's way.  Everything's coming up in the middle.  Doesn't matter.  Most people would be like...  Most people would be like, holy shit, you know, fucking I went to the Olympics, a bomb  went off.  It's like, wow, that's a terrible thing to have happened.  He's like, I made some bucks.  Yeah.  Made a few bucks.  I don't even know how close he was still. 
[02:20:00]  Doesn't matter.  FBI knows.  I think he finally said it was right behind him, but we know that's not true either.  He simply looked at it as a money-making opportunity, and that's all.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he did it.  You think he looks for those things?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's looking to make a buck anywhere he can, and he does it.  That is America, though.  Traumatized, but not Iraq.  Yeah.  There's no integrity to it.  Nah, none.  Mayor Bloomberg finally got something right.  What do you do now?  He blasts Chick-fil-A critics.  It says, trying to shut a store undermines the Constitution.  Oh, wow. 
[02:20:30]  Like, that isn't an easy thing to figure out.  Well, you can't shut down a business because, you know, the owner...  You don't agree with them.  The owner thinks a certain way.  Yeah.  You just can't.  But you got, yeah, Emanuel in Chicago and stupid fucking...  Menino.  Menino was trying to shut him down, right?  Yeah.  Trying to get him out of Boston or not to set up shop in Boston.  Like, where's the line?  What other things would he not agree with that he would say, well, I don't want your business 
[02:21:00]  in this city?  Like, who the fuck are you?  And, because people really get confused out there.  We don't agree with the Chick-fil-A guy.  But he should be able to say that.  Say whatever he wants.  Yeah.  He absolutely should be able to say that.  It's funny.  Menino's not throwing the Archdiocese of Boston out.  And meanwhile, the way they were covering up all this child fucking...  It's funny how Menino isn't targeting them, and they're pretty much against gay marriage.  Right.  How about you throw the churches out?  All you... 
[02:21:30]  And this fucking...  This twat Quinn from Long Island.  Chicken hawk filet.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Wow.  You ain't bullshitting.  Fucking cool people.  Oh, boy.  No, no, no.  We're good.  Oh, God.  We're good.  You got it.  No, no, no.  No.  You got it.  No, we're good.  We're going to go with this for a while.  Yeah, it's funny.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  Fuck me, asshole.  Whoa.  What?  That's so weird.  Yeah, why would you want that? 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  Chip-fil-A hates that stuff.  But Bloomberg, there you go.  Bloomberg's stepping up and saying that's wrong, so good for him.  That would be good.  Chip-fil-A, right?  I know.  We'd all be eating chicken and fucking cracking up.  Nothing's going to happen after that one.  He goes, I pointed at him.  He points and goes, that's going to be dramatic. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, stupid chip.  Hey, listen to me, cuck sucker.  I'm going to have a talk with him.  And we got another shooting.  I guess we should talk about this.  Sure.  Whoopsie.  This guy could be the dumbest motherfucker.  Six dead in Milwaukee so far.  I think, wasn't it seven?  They're saying seven now?  I think seven.  Sure, Ben.  What happened?  The guy goes in.  Guy, 40-some-odd-year-old white guy.  They're calling him a skinhead. 
[02:23:00]  Saying this is domestic terrorism.  Saying he's a veteran.  They're saying he has 9-11 tattoos in some capacity on him.  And that he may have thought that the Sikhs, the Indian Sikhs that were at this church were Muslim.  And decided to go in and just shoot the place up while they were...  I thought they were the same the day after 9-11.  And then...  Really?  Oh, I think immediately, yeah. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, immediately.  I didn't know.  I didn't know I have to shit.  And then you...  They're the ones with the big turbans.  You get educated and you learn.  They wear the turbans.  12 years later, you were just 12.  What are we up to?  Yeah.  About that.  11, 12 years?  Yeah.  11 years later, you think most people understand the difference between the two.  Yeah, yeah.  But this one...  This guy certainly did not.  Yeah.  Not saying it would be okay if they were, by the way.  Obviously.  Yeah.  But he did what he did because he thought they were Muslims? 
[02:24:00]  Did he?  I think he did.  Well, they're speculating.  Oh, so they don't even know.  He may have had another issue with Sikhs or he may have just been...  Oh, so they're speculating.  Yeah, but they're kind of putting two and two together.  It's a little early, though.  Yeah.  Let's see what his motives are when they haven't even really talked to the guy.  Ex-military, 9-11 tattoos, so they're assuming a few things.  They're assuming that, yeah, he might have thought they were Muslims.  Right.  A lot of people made that mistake.  There's no real reason to shoot up Sikhs. 
[02:24:30]  They're peaceful people that drive cabs.  I hear they're very peaceful.  Yeah.  They want everyone to know they're very, very peaceful.  Yeah.  Supposedly, they open up their churches and say, come on in.  Oh, really?  We'll educate you so you understand what this is all about.  Well, ain't that nice?  I guess everybody was confused because, you know, everybody goes, yeah, fucking ragheads.  And they're the guys that wear the turbans, the big turbans, not like the little kind of  just a white cloth over your head or something like that. 
[02:25:00]  Right.  They wear the big spinny, spun around material turban.  That just looks like how those work.  It looks exhausting.  It looks exhausting, right?  And hot as fuck and, oh, uncomfortable.  You've got to really love your religion.  You really do.  Well, good for you.  That's why religion is such horse shit.  Oh, my God.  The Jews wear this on their heads.  The fucking, dude, this guy wears that one.  That one wears that one.  God cares what your hat looks like.  Yeah, why all the hats of religion?  Why all the hats?  I guess because God figures that that's the best way to let people know who you are by 
[02:25:30]  your head covering.  What idiocy.  Big fucking Pope hat.  All of it's stupid.  Very silly.  Every religion has that shit.  It's all fucking...  Do the Catholics have hats?  Not for the people, but for like the cardinals.  Easter bonnet.  Easter bonnet.  So that's a horrible situation.  Yeah.  They took him out, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  They got that guy.  He wound up nailing a cop pretty good. 
[02:26:00]  He's in, I guess, serious condition, but they say he's going to pull through.  And, you know, this will just get people more agitated.  Got James Curtis.  He says he did what he did because he's an ignorant asshat.  Well, yeah.  Yes, James.  Figured that out.  No one was praising him.  No, of course not.  Worst thing is Sikhs are big supporters of the West.  Yeah. 
[02:26:30]  Love our way of life.  Our way.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's all right.  A lot of cab drivers are Sikhs.  Right?  You see them there with the turbans driving around?  I don't know.  What?  You don't see color?  I don't see turbans.  No, I'm not even saying that.  I don't, I don't, I really don't know.  I don't see turbans.  It's a bad day.  So if it's a turban, it's a Sikh every time?  I think so.  That type of turban.  Right.  I don't know of any other religion that wears that.  I don't know. 
[02:27:00]  There's the different types, like, you know.  Oh, by the way, I do see color.  Yeah.  Do you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't want to be in a cab with a white guy.  Oh, crazy white cab driver.  No, I'm.  That is true.  White cab drivers are terrible.  They're just crazy.  They always want to yap with you.  Long Island, white cab drivers.  Holy shit.  What is that about?  What is that about? 
[02:27:30]  Got to make that meth money somewhere.  Holy fuck.  So that's all we got.  Yeah.  Sad situation, and they're figuring it out.  I'm glad he's dead, though.  That's how you handle all these shooters.  No one cared why he did it.  It doesn't really matter.  He's dead.  Well, the Joker's still alive.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  The Joker.  And Loeffner there.  Jared Loeffner.  They're going to give him life, I guess, right?  Why not just clean him out?  How is that?  Why?  He's a crazy fuck. 
[02:28:00]  Just crush him like an insect.  Plea bargain.  He shoots a baby.  What a piece of garbage.  He shot a baby, right?  Yes.  All the shootings were horrible, but, I mean, just get rid of him.  Just fucking squash his head.  Does Arizona have the death penalty?  I don't even know.  I'm pretty sure they do, right?  And this isn't a death penalty case either?  Yeah, because he bargained it.  Well, fuck the bargaining.  He got a plea.  Why would he plea?  So crazy.  Why was it a crazy guy?  Plea.  What's his plea?  He was off his medication that day or something?  He's please guilty.  Just don't fucking kill me. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, well, I would assume a few people that day were like, please don't kill me.  I know.  Could you just shoot me in the leg, you crazy fuck?  Yeah, no one wants to fucking put people to death anymore.  Yeah, why don't they ever look at the other side of this?  I'm sure there were victims, you know, pleading their case at the time, too.  He murdered six fucking people.  God, I hate this shit.  And they just fucking, he literally, how are you allowed, because it's America, oh, beef.  How are you allowed to plea this shit?  He shouldn't be allowed to, you know, you should put him on trial. 
[02:29:00]  He's schizophrenic, and he probably is schizophrenic, but again, I'm sick of crazy fucks getting  the excuse that they're crazy.  I don't care if he's schizophrenic.  Kill him.  Yeah.  And you know what?  Life in jail just becomes your life.  Yeah.  It really does.  That's it.  He'll make the best of it.  He'll make friends.  He'll talk.  He'll fucking watch TV.  He'll do whatever he needs to do to live.  Sick of being burdened by these fucking kooks.  Enough of these fucking sick fucks burdening all of us. 
[02:29:30]  God almighty.  But he got to plea it down to a life sentence, right?  Yeah.  That's it.  No chance of parole?  No, no.  He's away forever, but...  60 more years we have to look at his fucking face.  60 more years we have to pay to keep him alive, that he gets to see his family, that he gets  to talk and write and do interviews.  Yep.  Enough of these crazy fucks.  He's just in a big apartment complex where a bunch of roommates and they're very strict  on the rules. 
[02:30:00]  That's it.  But that's pretty much what it is, you know?  He doesn't get to fuck girls.  He probably didn't anyway because he's a nut with an awful schizophrenic breath.  Probably dry white shit in the corner of his mouth.  Schizophrenics have bad breath.  I'm sure they do.  They have to because all they're doing is crazy.  Oh, I was hoping you had a story.  No, it's probably just hot fucking breath.  Oh, dried up New England clam chowder in the corner of his mouth.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jeffrey Ross gotten a little bit of a...  I saw Jeff last night.  Did you?  At the cellar.  He's a funny fucking dude.  He showed up to the roast dressed like Joe Paterno.  Yeah. 
[02:30:30]  With two shirtless guys in football helmets wearing nothing but towels.  It looked like he was very young.  How great is that joke?  And he did a fucking Colorado joke.  He did a Colorado joke.  That's why people are starting to go like, uh, uh, but the joke is really, it's a funny  fucking joke, especially when directed at the likes of Seth Green.  Good for him, man.  But people will say it's too soon.  What's that too soon shit too, by the way?  I don't know.  He did exactly what he should have done.  I don't know.  Where's the joke? 
[02:31:00]  It was, uh...  Good one.  He turned to Seth Green and said,  Mm, mm, mm, mm.  Nice to see you.  Congratulations.  This is actually a really big night for you.  You haven't gotten this much attention since you shot all those people in Aurora.  All right.  His red hair.  Right.  And looking, uh, silly.  And then he said, uh, I'm kidding.  You're not like James Holmes.  At least he's doing something in a movie theater that people remember.  That's a hilarious roast joke.  It's a funny roast joke right there.  Wow.  It's brutal, but it's funny.  Guarantee a Comedy Central will edit that out. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, you will never see that joke.  That's a hilarious fucking roast joke.  Good for Jeff Ross, man.  And if it's a roast, leave that shit in.  It's supposed to be.  They're not going to.  No.  It's supposed to make people go like, whoa, fucking, it's a roast.  You see, um, Tom Arnold did a surprise too?  Yeah.  Oh, Tom Arnold showed up, huh?  It was the Roseanne roast, obviously, and Roseanne didn't want him.  And then it was the big surprise at the end.  It came out at the very, very end.  Yeah.  And, uh, his jokes were pretty funny. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  Did he make fun of her pussy and stuff?  They went back and forth a little bit.  You want to read that, Sam?  It's pretty good.  It's short.  Oh, wow.  That's a long article.  It's short.  Oh, that's long.  It's like a bunch of Bibles in a row.  No, it's not.  Oh, in our local paper, it's just a little thing, but it gives you a couple of the jokes  back and forth between the two.  Was it about their sex life?  Were they talking about that?  It's in the paper.  Give me a bad.  He said something about, I don't want to rip you a new one because I've seen your old  one.  It was just something like that.  It's fantastic. 
[02:32:30]  It's fantastic.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wait.  We got to read them now.  Tom Arnold.  He was very good in True Lies.  That's about it.  With Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Is he a big bully with Tom Arnold and Rick Moranis?  Look, no.  You're good?  No, I don't want to get it all.  And I can't ever see it.  Did you enjoy it?  No, I hated it.  You loved it?  I sold it back to FYE for a dollar.  A buck?  Yeah.  It's actually got a lot of money for it.  Righteous bucks.  It's something they will never sell. 
[02:33:00]  Now, what is this?  Oh.  Turned, I said.  Stop it.  He's poking him.  Edgar.  Shut up.  Yeah, I'm trying to find a tail.  You're being poked.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, this is a full transcript of everything.  Stop, Edgar.  This is a transcript of everything.  Stop.  Everything that he said.  We don't want that.  We just want the jokes.  Let me see.  Edgar, you can't.  Stop touching me, Edgar.  Shut up.  You shut up.  I'll get this field hockey thing.  It's just so weird. 
[02:33:30]  Sticks are stupid.  Yeah.  Fucking dumb.  Yeah.  Some sports, they can't just.  Who the fuck wants to play teams ping pong?  How much room do you need?  The table's too small.  Oh, shit.  And by the way, what does a ping pong coach say?  Hit it, stop it.  Hit it, stop it.  Hit it, stop it.  What do I do, coach?  Don't let it hit the floor.  Thanks, coach.  Put me in, coach.  That looks like a horrible sport.  It's fucking terrible.  Do only Asians play in this? 
[02:34:00]  They're only good at it.  It seems like this is not a.  They're really good at it for whatever reason.  Why are they so good at it?  Angles.  Math.  Is that it?  I don't know.  That's a stereotype.  Do they have a lefty and a righty always play?  I guess they do.  I don't know.  Look at the one clapping.  Oh, God.  All right, here we go.  I get the hair like a Justin Habib.  Here we go.  So Jimmy did the first one.  I'm not here to tear Roseanne a new one because, quite frankly, I've seen the old one. 
[02:34:30]  And it is spectacular.  Tom Multero also said, when I was with Roseanne, she had 27 personalities, and only two of  them liked me.  One was a small German boy.  And then he goes on, she may not be the perfect wife, but she is literally the worst fucking  ex-wife on the planet.  That's pretty good.  But then Roseanne, man, she comes back.  She goes, I'm glad you have a new wife, Tom.  I hope she isn't just with you for your money. 
[02:35:00]  I mean, my money.  He does these impersonations.  I swear, you would think of it as the real people.  I was just trying to pump it up a little bit.  I hope she isn't just with you for your money.  I mean, my money.  That's good.  Yeah, yeah.  So, yeah, she enjoyed it in the end.  She thought it was cool that it came out.  Can't wait to see that roast.  Yeah, I'll watch it on TV because that's the only way I get to see them.  Oh, Jimmy.  You weren't there live?  No.  You weren't on it?  Like in the dais? 
[02:35:30]  No.  Why do you turn them down?  That's weird.  You know what's funny?  They just never ask.  Oh, man.  I'd respect them so much more if they just...  I know the director probably doesn't like me, but just say it.  But haven't you done a bunch of the other roasts?  Actually, no.  I've only done one.  Oh.  At Bob Saget's request.  Oh.  That's why I love Bob Saget.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Bob is all right.  Yeah, he's a good boy.  Oh, do you?  Well, he requested me.  Oh, well, good.  I don't know. 
[02:36:00]  I'm just trying to figure out this.  I'm starting to think the Olympics suck.  They stink.  Field hockey and doubles ping pong is on right now?  What gives a fuck?  Who would watch a whole field hockey?  This is not a real sport, field hockey.  I'm sorry.  And these Olympics, they're really starting to show off the women's bodies, but not in  field hockey.  No.  God forbid the one sport where they bend down a lot.  Those old uniforms.  Right.  And the ball keeps rolling off out of the fucking... 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, they can't even keep the ball in play.  It looks just horrendous.  Look at this.  The sticks are stupid.  They're stupid.  They're too short.  Big blue field.  So dumb.  It's just...  The field is pretty, though.  I like the big...  That's a giant...  It's like a soccer field.  It looks like a big blue screen.  You could keep people out.  I'm starting to think it's important to play field hockey on the edges.  Why are they spending so much time down the sideline?  Yeah, just run up and throw...  Why wouldn't you go down the middle of the field?  Is that a bad place to be in field hockey?  Take a shot.  Who are these teams? 
[02:37:00]  I don't know.  It's China and Japan.  It's China against Japan.  Look at the hairstyles.  I know.  They're just fantastic.  It's the same hair.  The same hairstyles.  Hairstyles.  Look at that.  Well, China has very...  Straight break.  They all have...  Straight break.  They all have the one hairstyle.  And then Japan, you know...  Occasionally, they mix it up.  They mix it up a little bit.  Just a little bit.  I notice my hair not looking very good. 
[02:37:30]  Not very attractive.  Cannot set myself apart from other people.  So I get a new fancy American haircut looking like a Rick Springfield.  That one's very good.  That's a friend of mine.  Girls, love him now.  Love him now.  He went to Bob and said,  Please, make it to me look like a John Bon Jovi. 
[02:38:00]  Rick Springfield.  Buddy of mine.  That's from Baboogie Night.  I wish I had Jesse's girl.  I'm so jealous.  She had Jesse's girl.  She should be with me.  Oh, that's a good one.  I look like one of the golden girls.  Platinum brand.  Oh, man. 
[02:38:30]  That guy's spiky.  Yeah, it is.  I want the hairstyle.  I look very hip.  Even if I'm 40 years old.  I say, give me a Detroit quad.  He's 40, right?  Because he told me he wasn't.  I don't know.  I have no idea.  I told Nicole he was 39 and we just say he's 40.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I guess he's like 39.  Like a hair looking like a Bob Big Boy.  Hey.  It's great music. 
[02:39:00]  Do you know we couldn't do this on terrestrial radio?  No.  That medium sucks.  Everybody gets all fucking crazy.  Just having a little laugh.  Just having a little laugh with the people in the Olympic spirit of things.  I got a tinkle.  So do I.  Oh.  You know what we could do going into break?  Because I think it plays very well for the radio.  We had a little spot on Louie's show on FX.  I have not seen it.  I finally saw the episode.  It was hilarious.  It was fucking great. 
[02:39:30]  I diarrhea-ed in the tongue.  Oh, my God.  I diarrhea-ed.  It was a great episode.  Robin Williams was great.  And was he doing Vinnie Brand?  Was Louie doing Vinnie Brand when he was making fun of that comedy club owner that died?  I don't know.  He was doing a little Vinnie Brand impression there.  I wonder what that was.  I don't know if there was something to it.  Robin Williams was just great, but he wasn't nearly as good as any of you three.  Period.  Wow. 
[02:40:00]  You weren't in it, Edgar.  I wasn't talking to you.  You shudder.  Here it is.  Here it is from Louie's show.  It plays well for radio because it's a radio bit.  So we'll play this and we'll see you on the other side.  Hello?  Hi, is this Louie?  Yeah.  I'm Jeff.  I produced the show.  We're going to have you on the air in one minute, okay?  Okay.  Okay, you'll be on with Tracer Pig and The Hole is Diane.  The Hole?  You're going to hear some music right now and then you'll be on with the guys.  Just sit tight.  Thanks.  Okay, thank you. 
[02:40:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  That's about it, Diane, coming down to China.  That's the big shit.  Don't.  That's a mamadine chance and we got Louie C.K. on the line.  Hi.  All right.  Hi, Louie.  Hi.  Hey, thanks for coming on to China.  We got to see time.  See time.  Well, thank you for having me.  Louie C.K. is all time a funny, funny. 
[02:41:00]  Hi, he's a funny.  And just Danny is going to be at the Stanford and Son Comedy Club next week from Thursday through Saturday night.  You can get tickets by going to StanfordsComedyClub.com.  That's right.  So, Louie.  Hey, what do you think of the whole clammy damn channel thing going down until you're ready there?  Well, I wouldn't want to be that guy, you know.  He sounds like he's in a lot of trouble.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh, my God.  Ho, ho.  That's a crab.  That's a digger.  What about that?  Ooh, yeah. 
[02:41:30]  Ah, well.  Oh, wow.  That's a crab and uncle.  Ah, yeah, yeah.  And what about the guy on the cover of the gym now?  He might be a little chatty.  Ah, well, you know, maybe, right?  Ha, ha.  Louie C.K.  Ah, that's so bad.  Louie C.K.  He's going to be at the Stanford and Son's Comedy Club Thursday through Saturday night.  Get your tickets now at StanfordsComedyClub.com.  Louie.  Yeah.  You ever go to Damn and Damn Penny?  Yeah, sure.  I'm a single guy.  Why not? 
[02:42:00]  Get down.  There goes the last fight.  I might wear a couple of condoms, though.  Ow.  Louie C.K.  A dirty, dirty guy.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, Louie.  Hey, what do you think of the baddabomb about Kansas City?  Oh, Kansas City.  Well, I've been going there to work the clubs for the last ten years or so.  Uh-huh.  And I'd have to say Kansas City is the worst town I've ever been in.  I mean, what a dump, right?  It's got to be the worst city in North America, and that includes Mexico and Canada. 
[02:42:30]  Hello?  Okay, Louie C.K.  Hey, thanks for coming on the air.  Oh, okay.  Hello?  Sirius XM.  XM.  This is the OPN FA Show.  We're sitting here watching the Olympics, and we're getting really fucking infuriated by this dumb field hockey.  Field hockey stinks. 
[02:43:00]  These players, we're watching women's field hockey, they are the best in the world, and they can't make any plays, because the stick sucks.  That stick is dumb.  It's a hook.  And they can't even pass it to each other, because it's so hard to control.  I don't understand the hook part.  Like, once it starts curving back up, it's useless.  So all you have to hit the ball with is a spot on the bottom of the hook that's like two inches by two inches.  It's probably the same width as the ball, more or less. 
[02:43:30]  There's not much room for error.  Why don't they just make it into, I don't know, like hockey, like floor hockey.  Yeah.  Roller hockey, whatever the fuck it's called.  All the field hockey.  Make that stick flatter, and maybe it would be all right.  Look.  It's a hook.  I know you can't look.  It's radio.  But it's so stupid.  They can't make any plays.  We're watching a game.  It's 26 minutes to go in the second half, I guess.  I guess they play halves.  It's 0-0.  Yeah, no one's scored yet.  It's another one of these sports where there's not much scoring. 
[02:44:00]  I noticed the chicks that played field hockey in high school and stuff, and then in college, a lot of dykes.  A lot of girls that like other girls.  Oh, look at the stick.  I've said it before.  Yeah.  That stick has made you hit that G-spot.  Just fucking.  And then, like, you can't even look at their asses because they're wearing skirts.  So they're bending down, but who cares?  They're dated uniforms.  You think?  Yeah.  Because these uniforms for these Olympics are fucking skimpy. 
[02:44:30]  Holy shit.  Yeah, some of them.  Who are the...  Oh, my God.  Look at them.  They're like, hey, how you doing?  Hey.  There's a man on the left.  We won, so let's go les out now.  Yeah.  There was a link that I clicked on from Twitter that somebody said, hey, check out this beach  volleyball, some stills, and it was the chicks giving signals behind their back, and they  kind of right near their ass, and then them patting the ass of the other player after something  good.  It was pretty hot.  This Olympics is very sexual. 
[02:45:00]  Yes, a lot of sex going on.  My best tweet of the weekend was just a retweet of a guy who sent me a montage of water polo  tits.  Oh, really?  Wow.  That was good.  Are we allowed to put that on the Facebook page?  Probably not because of Facebook, right?  You can link to it.  You just can't host it.  Yeah, we probably should.  Any good ones, though?  I don't know.  It's just kind of hot because when it's not supposed to happen, it's hot.  That's true.  Yeah, because that looks like happening there.  Is she all embarrassed that her tits come out? 
[02:45:30]  It's on her back, and her tits just popped out.  There's a million of them, though.  A lot of tits pop out during the water polo.  Yep.  I didn't realize that.  But they've been playing water polo for a real long time.  This is the first year where they're kind of...  Wait, that's during water polo?  Yeah.  How did the cop come from?  Referee.  Oh, okay.  Did you see the guy who has to hold the bike seat for the cyclist?  That's a funny picture, too.  There's some good shit out there.  Yeah, look at that.  The young lady has no idea if she's in the middle of the game still. 
[02:46:00]  Her tit is just hanging out.  Tits out.  It's because they're wearing skimpy shit.  Wait, what?  They have no panties on?  Her panties are off.  That's kind of weird.  I think that's...  I don't think that's...  Yeah, that's got to be an actual water polo match.  It's very strange, all that snatch.  Sneet.  Yeah, I saw that picture of all the hot athletes underwater naked.  That's kind of cool.  What?  That's water polo?  Right here, yeah.  Really?  No, it's not.  Some guy's feeling her big tits. 
[02:46:30]  They stick his face between them.  That's underwater polo?  I don't think that's water polo at all.  When you Google image water polo, that's...  All right.  I think you're loyig.  I'm not loyig.  I think you're loyig.  I get my point.  It's out there if you want to search for it.  It's out there.  It's out there.  But the field hockey, it's still 0-0.  Nothing's going on.  They can't control the ball.  That's awful.  A lot of these sports, I've said it, there's just too many players.  Like, cut down the amount of players in soccer, you're going to see a much better game.  You see what just happened? 
[02:47:00]  Two players around next to each other and their hooked sticks grabbed each other's.  Right.  And it ripped it out of one of the girls' hands.  What happens then?  I don't know.  Was that a cool play?  And then the other coverage we get to see is Team Ping Pong.  Yeah.  It's a slow day, isn't it?  What?  Mm-hmm.  Look at the haircuts.  Wow.  What is that?  Oh, the haircut.  Yeah, that's a good one.  This one, I want to look very... 
[02:47:30]  Where people rank me in England.  So I said, please to give me the George Harrison.  Their hair is hilarious.  It's the same.  Yeah.  Then I like to go back to my standard.  I go, where is a Peter Rose?  Oh, my God.  Look at that awful.  We were talking about field hockey, Jimmy, and how it's infuriating. 
[02:48:00]  It stinks, dude.  Because you don't even see any plays for me because they can't control it.  Nothing's happening.  It's dull.  Tennis ball on a blue field.  Fuck yourselves.  Terrible.  That ball will knock your teeth out, though.  Oh, I'm sure it will.  Yeah.  Is it a tennis ball?  No, no, no, no.  It's like a wood or something.  It's kind of like a lacrosse ball, I think.  Yeah.  I believe.  They are pretty nasty.  I fucking...  My eyes are burning today.  Why?  Well, um...  Too much chlorine in the pool? 
[02:48:30]  No, no, no.  No, the pool's fucking great.  Bunch of cum in your eye or something?  That's what it was.  It was a bunch of cum in my eyes.  I hate that.  Throws your throat, too, right?  Yeah.  You know how I usually go overboard with things if I get interested in something?  I do tend to go a little overboard.  Well, uh, the, um, the little, uh, you know, remote control helicopter thingy?  Mm-hmm.  The little four-bladed...  Yep.  ...quad copter? 
[02:49:00]  Um, well, I wanted to get the next level up.  It was a good entry-level, little starty thing with the camera on it and stuff.  Fly around the yard, you use an iPad and shit, and it's pretty cool.  But I started looking, and I'm like, oh, there's some pretty cool ones out there.  So I ordered up one, and, uh...  Did you order an actual helicopter, knowing you?  Well, no, I would have liked to.  You're on your way.  I would like to.  The one that took Dick Morrow's hat off.  Yeah.  No, I, uh, I, I got a quad copter, you know, four, four blades. 
[02:49:30]  And, uh, but it's like a, it's a pretty good one.  And a lot of stuff goes on it.  There's GPS, compass, barometric altimeter, um, video downlink, so I could fly it, like,  from the computer.  Waypoint on, uh, you punch up pretty much Google Earth, and you just gotta click on where you  want it to go, and it'll fly there.  You, you type in the altitude and, and where you want it to go on the map, and it just goes 
[02:50:00]  there.  But how do you get it back?  You, you, uh...  How far could it go from your house?  Go home, 10 kilometers.  10 kilometers.  How far is that with miles?  Yeah, it's like...  Six miles?  Six point two miles?  Yeah.  How high?  Um, some guy got his up to 16,000 feet.  What?  But, uh, that's like a record.  Isn't that an FAA problem?  I think it is.  It might, especially around where you live.  I think it is.  You might have a plane hit that.  He'd put a hole in the plane.  Terrible.  You got those planes going over your house.  I was driving on the LIE. 
[02:50:30]  I went to FH Riley's.  My brother's joined, just kicking it.  Yeah, I like planes fly over the house.  But, I was on the LIE, and I'm noticing the planes flying pretty damn low.  It depends on the weather, and, uh, yeah, pretty much the weather.  But you see these, they're low when they come by your house.  Oh, yeah.  There was some nights I'm laying in bed, and I swear, it's like, oh boy, Donnie Darko.  Really?  Engine's gonna fall on my head.  Really?  Yeah, but, uh, oh, yeah, I was saying.  This thing can go 6.2 miles?  Yeah, yeah.  That's pretty far.  And send video back. 
[02:51:00]  And it's got GPS, so.  But if it has GPS, why couldn't it just go for, you know, wherever?  Why only 6.2 in the end?  Well, it's gotta send and receive a signal on where to go.  Like, it's gotta receive a signal from the base station.  Yeah, I gotcha.  Yeah, and, uh.  Well, couldn't you at least send the signal to get it further than the 6.2, but then at  that point, you're fucked, because you can't get.  Yeah, then you wouldn't be able to get it back.  Right.  But it does have a, uh, a return to home, because it knows exactly where it is, because 
[02:51:30]  it's got GPS, so if it ever loses the signal, it goes up to a certain altitude, comes all  the way back, and just lands itself where it took off.  So do that.  Yeah, you can do that.  You should do that just to check it out.  But it'll just, it'll just come home.  Is that a better one than you had?  Oh, yeah.  More expensive?  Oh, yeah.  A tad.  A tad more expensive.  Wait, it went from what to what, money-wise, on this?  Yeah, what is it?  Well, the, the little one, the, uh, Parrot drone, AR drone, was about 300 bucks.  When all said and done, this is probably a couple of grand. 
[02:52:00]  Okay.  That's not bad for a hobby, though.  You know, with cameras and stuff.  That's gonna be worse.  You know, it's got, like, uh, the GoPro camera goes on it, and then another camera can go  on it to, uh, you actually fly it by visual.  Like, you're, you're flying it.  And, uh, but here's the deal.  Uh, last time I was building helicopters was early 2000s, you know?  And, uh, now I, I'm like, okay, I gotta put this thing together.  I'm used to doing that.  My fucking eyes just ain't there anymore. 
[02:52:30]  I have to put glasses on.  And then there's certain circumstances where you gotta, like, you're putting something  together, so you're, like, upside down.  Your head's upside down.  And the glasses kept sliding off.  And I'm just yelling.  That's good.  I was so annoyed.  And then even the best glasses, which I don't have, I just fucking get the cheapo ones,  are not made for, like, that long, up-close work like that.  Bifocals.  Little fucking screws, you know? 
[02:53:00]  And soldering little connectors on the ends of wires.  You have to solder?  Yeah.  It's a kit.  Why are you soldering?  Because it's a kit.  Oh, so you're building your own helicopter.  Yeah, you build it.  How do you do that?  Get someone to do it.  No, it's fine.  He likes that shit.  You don't have to solder?  All you do is put a wire on the connector, heat it up with the little soldering iron,  and then you go, bloop, you touch the solder to it, and it melts, and you're done.  You actually have to solder?  Yeah, you've got to solder connectors on all the motors. 
[02:53:30]  Wait, why don't they just do it?  Why don't they make them like that?  I don't know.  It's part of, like, the kit.  How big is the helicopter going to be?  It's not, uh, it's, you know.  Oh, it's bigger than I thought.  It's like that and that, the X, and then it's got...  Maybe, like, a two-by-two.  A big compartment for the autopilot, and it's got a thing on the back where it looks like a fucking, like, radar dish on top of it.  Nice.  How many batteries?  Cameras.  It's got, like, proprietary batteries that you charge up.  Big fucking block batteries.  Nah, it's not that heavy.  It's all carbon fiber, so it's, uh... 
[02:54:00]  Ten pounds?  It weighs as much as, uh, as much as, like, a laptop.  That's it?  Yeah.  What if that falls on somebody?  Well, I guess it would hurt them.  So, how many miles are you from the city?  Because, to not, uh, um, 30 miles from the city.  Oh, you're that far?  Yeah, I'm pretty far.  I'm pretty far.  Is this thing built?  Um, I started building it yesterday and got it, like, pretty much all done.  I just gotta get the camera.  No, no, I still, I'm still waiting for a transmitter receiver thingy. 
[02:54:30]  Wait, you ordered it?  I need, yeah.  They don't come with it?  No, that's just it.  Everything's fucking, like, you know, separate.  So, you gotta make, for the soldering thing, they say here's a soldering iron?  Well, I have a soldering iron.  Well, I would, yeah.  So, of course you do.  And then you gotta kinda, you know, put them in little, in little clamps, because you can't  work a soldering iron, the solder, and hold the piece together all at the same time.  You know, I don't have, uh, four hands.  So, you clamp it. 
[02:55:00]  I clamp it, yeah.  You clamp the little piece in there, put the wire in, heat it up, and bloop.  But what if you don't, soldering, it melts it to it, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Is soldering good?  What do you mean?  Is that, like, is that better than, like, wrapping it around?  Oh, my God, yeah.  Imagine.  It ain't gonna move after you soldered.  It doesn't come loose.  And then, after you do that, you put the little shrink tubing over it, and then you run the  soldering iron over the edges of it, and it shrinks down over the solder, and, uh,  holds it.  You know, it'll never go anywhere. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, then it's totally, uh, nice.  And I put all those together, and then each arm, there's four arms.  You gotta, you know, look at the instructions, which are written in Chinese and shit.  Are they?  But you look at the picture, and it's like, okay.  The diagrams are never accurate.  It's, I remember, though, doing this, like...  There's something with the diagrams of the helicopters.  I'm driving nuts.  A few years ago.  Yeah.  So, it wasn't anything new.  Like, I wasn't shocked.  Right.  At it.  But the eye thing, that's what got me.  I was like, so now today, I'm kind of, like, headachy, because my eyes were just fucking, 
[02:56:00]  like, my eyes were going crazy.  I finally had to get, uh, glasses to drive at night.  You should get, go get a pair of glasses.  Yeah.  No, it's not one of those.  It's the, uh, I wound up getting the X650 Quad.  Is that good?  Is that the best one?  It's the best one in there.  Uh, well, no.  It's not the best one, but it's pretty damn good.  How do they get better than that?  Go to images.  Hold on.  How do they get better than that for civilians?  Um, you should see some...  What's the next step up?  I don't even really know, but, yeah, that's kind of the one. 
[02:56:30]  That's kind of cool looking.  But that's not without the decorative thing.  What other things does that do that your old one doesn't?  Because you were getting some cool video and doing some cool things with the other one.  Yeah, but this one goes a lot higher and further.  And, and it's got, like, really good real-time video.  Did the video look good, though?  Yeah, but this will look, this is right from the GoPro camera.  Right.  It'll look really fucking good.  Dude, you could literally go up and watch a plane go by at the same height,  because they're a couple thousand feet above your house.  That would be very dangerous. 
[02:57:00]  No, don't do it.  Right.  But, I mean, you could, you could see...  That would not be good.  A plane, like...  Yeah, at the same height.  So the wind would rip it apart, though.  I probably would.  The jet, get a little jet blast.  You've got to get high enough where you can see the city skyline.  I think that would be cool.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  From your house.  I was barely able to see it with the little one.  Sort of?  Yeah.  I could sort of see it with the little one, but with this one, definitely.  Forget it.  And there's, there's LED.  I think people are going to think there's a UFO in my, in my neighborhood.  Could you sell pot with something like that? 
[02:57:30]  You probably could.  Dude, that's a great idea.  Could you sell pot with something?  You absolutely could.  Could, let's say, theoretically, you put some weed in there, right?  Theoretically, like you need to sell pot.  And then you, uh, you set the waypoint on your map to somebody's that, you know, their  house.  That's what I'm saying.  Their backyard.  And it lands within a yard of where you want it to with the GPS.  So you send it there, it lands, and then he puts his money in there, and then you take  back off and you go to home and it comes back.  Can you do that from the Mexico to U.S. border? 
[02:58:00]  I bet they have.  Although you can't probably take too much.  Yeah.  But yeah, sure.  There's probably not enough to make the cartels happy.  Yeah.  We got $37 worth of cocaine over, boss.  In the last 10 hours.  Yeah.  We did 180 trips.  And all you do is...  We're getting there.  You're giving away your position, because if they capture the helicopter, they know where  you are.  Cocaine, maybe, yeah.  Yeah.  Take some coke.  Oh, I'm sure these things have been used for some...  Take some coke over.  Some things.  Yeah.  You think this is the same technology as a Predator drone?  Absolutely. 
[02:58:30]  Same fucking technology.  It's really amazing with this fucking thing to do.  Is this as good as the drone?  Just uses...  It does...  You know, obviously, it's not going to be the military specs, but it does the same shit.  You know, you're pointing and clicking on a map, and it will go there and just stay  there.  It'll just fucking hang out until the battery dies.  And then it'll...  Well, before the battery dies, it'll land itself.  What?  It'll, like, land itself.  It knows, like, the battery is dying, so it'll fucking just land itself. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, you should set it to come home when the battery's dying.  You can.  Yeah, there's a setting for that, too.  There's a setting for easy flight.  There's, like, a setting for everything.  You do it with your iPad?  Crazy.  No, this one, you need the remote, the regular...  But wasn't it cool with the iPad?  It was pretty cool.  Do it with just the iPad in your backyard?  Yeah, but I kind of like a fucking big remote control, 10-channel, lots of switches and  dials.  How can you fly it though with visual?  Is there, like, a monitor on it?  Uh, yeah, you get a 7-inch monitor, and you, uh, connect it onto your, um, remote. 
[02:59:30]  It's crazy.  You just, you could, you don't even have to look at the model anymore.  You could just fucking look at the screen and fly it like that.  I look forward to the videos.  Oh, I will make some videos.  Will it be in the air today?  No.  No.  It's gonna take a while.  Not till after Chicago.  Oh, boy.  It's gonna take a while.  If you want to fly it to Chicago, I'll have to go up to the C.S. Tower and go, what's  up?  I could do that.  You want to go on the ground and fly it up, and I'll look at it, I'll give it the fucking  thing.  It'll be a viral video. 
[03:00:00]  Here's somebody obviously gonna shit on my parade.  Do you want me to take the call?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You sure?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Because you're all in with the quadcopters.  I love this.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Atlanta.  Jeff, were you close to the, uh, the bombing down there in the Olympics back in 96?  No, I was a long way from there.  Yeah.  So was E-Rock, but E-Rock made it by himself.  E-Rock got some cash.  Oh, by the way, there is an update on Richard Jewell.  He is dead.  Oh, is he?  Did people know that? 
[03:00:30]  No, he died in 07.  Oh.  You're kidding me.  Just because people need to know that info.  Uh, Jeff, go ahead.  Sorry.  Yeah, the quadcopters were pretty cool, uh, like, a couple years ago, last year.  We were all making them by hand last year.  We were taking apart Wii controllers.  And, uh, you know, Bill's using the components from a Wii controller to make them.  So now you've got tricopters.  They fly more like fixed-wing, but they also hover.  So they fly more like an Osprey, the actual airplane, the Osprey.  And, uh...  Yeah. 
[03:01:00]  Why would I want that, as opposed to a quadcopter with GPS and, uh, cameras?  Well, you do the same thing on your tricopter.  Um, they do all the same functions.  Your safety and, you know, they'll return to base.  We actually have one built with facial recognition.  So you can, uh, you can take it up and fly it and, and program all the facial recognition.  And it'll fly up to, and search people out. 
[03:01:30]  So, uh...  Mine has eight motors.  Eight motors to lift that heavy camera.  How much do you think yours is worth?  The one you're talking about is worth, sir?  How much does it worth?  Yeah.  How much do they go for?  Oh, I mean, we buy all the parts out of China pretty cheap.  So maybe a couple hundred bucks, you can build it all by hand.  But, yeah, we carry two GoPros, one on the bottom, uh, and then a camera on top to do third-person  or first-person fly, however you want to do it.  And then, uh, have facial recognition also. 
[03:02:00]  So it'll take off, fly over to somebody's face.  I understand you wanted to call up and crow about your tri-fucking copters.  Uh, but, you know, you don't have to shit on my quadcopter, sir.  I'm just trying to have a little fun here.  But how sad are you?  You want a tri-copter now?  No, I saw the tri-copters.  Oh, you did?  I took a look at them.  Yeah.  I wanted the quadcopter.  I like that.  I wish I could fly one in, uh, Manhattan.  You should bring it into the city and we'll go to Central Park. 
[03:02:30]  We'll go to Sheet Meadow or something.  That would be a pisser.  I do want to get, like, video at Central Park and the city and stuff.  Uh, yeah, the Hudson River.  That would look cool.  It would look cool.  It would look really cool.  Some of these fucking trees and then up the sides of the buildings, look in the windows.  Well, no one looks in windows in New York City.  Oh, well.  No one does that.  Holy shit, everyone has a telescope.  Wow.  Yeah, fuck that.  Ding of the past, motherfucker.  Thank you, Jeff.  All right.  That was really good.  Really good phone call.  Yes.  And, uh...  Thanks for your tri-copter, my ass. 
[03:03:00]  I hope you enjoy your day and that's it.  Thank you.  I quadcopter it.  Try to make it sound like people were doing it last year.  Like it was a fad that's gone.  Yeah.  My word.  If...  I just want to...  I'm not going to say...  If he's here, do you want him?  I gotta go.  Hmm?  I gotta go.  Would you want to talk to him?  Not really.  I'm not a big fan.  Okay.  Never have been.  I tell Roland to wait for my boneyard shot.  Okay.  This new album is really good.  Is it?  Yeah. 
[03:03:30]  I was never really a big fan.  I wasn't either, actually.  Yeah.  He's good.  But I like this.  I like him.  I do like him.  I just don't know what I would ask him.  Bum, bum, bum, bum.  It smells good?  Yeah, it does.  All right, listen.  We'll wrap up for today.  Let's not forget Chicago's.  It's right around the corner at this point.  Yeah.  We're all looking forward to it.  I've wanted to go to Chicago for a long time.  Yeah.  And I can't believe it's our first time. 
[03:04:00]  Jimmy's been there a lot.  Many times.  And my anti-social show with Artie, Nick, and Dave is the Saturday night at the Horseshoe  Casino in Hammond.  And Friday, come see us.  And our afternoon gig.  And Artie had a good cameo during that Louie episode.  Yeah, he did.  I forgot to mention that.  Oh, did he?  I didn't know that.  Oh, it was hilarious.  It was a surly truck driver.  And he goes running.  Yeah.  Running away.  It was quick, but it was hilarious.  Yeah.  Live in Chicago this Friday, August 10th, 115 Bourbon Street, located at 3359 West 115  Street in Marionette Park. 
[03:04:30]  All this info is on our Facebook page.  Opie and Anthony, one word.  Like us, motherfuckers.  Just outside of Chicago.  Broadcast.  So, doors open at 2, right?  That's official?  Yes.  Yes.  Doors open at 2, and then we're going to be broadcasting like 2.15 at 3.05, I think.  Something like that.  It's official.  No, doors open at 2.  Get there, please.  We want to see a lot of people.  Or we're going to look like complete idiots.  There'll be a lot of people there.  And we've got a lot of contests and stuff.  Any females for the pig race? 
[03:05:00]  Not yet, but, you know, it's open.  It's $1,000 on the line, ladies.  Come on.  Yeah, looking for big gals to kind of maybe humiliate themselves a little bit.  Yes, to be totally honest with you, but we'll put a pig mask on you and, you know,  we'll fucking, we'll be cool.  Don't even worry about it.  It's going to be a great time.  You get $1,000.  What of it?  Right.  What of it?  Gary's here today?  I thought he was on vacation.  He was on vacation all last week.  And he came back today.  Yeah, he's back today.  Oh, anyone else notice the difference? 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  Oh, I mean, no.  And other contests, like the Bad Breath Contest, the worst breath, I should say.  Oddest thing you own.  That's going to be cool.  We've done that before.  Any hint of odd things coming in?  Anyone email saying, I got this?  I got that?  Well, we haven't asked either.  I mean, I could do a little after-show survey today, maybe.  The oddest thing ever, and I'm hoping someone maybe could beat this, was the freeze-dried  monkey in the bag.  Oh, yeah.  And then the guy stuck his dick in the bag.  Well, that might have happened, yeah. 
[03:06:00]  Oh, it did happen.  Oh, it did happen.  It was in Philadelphia.  Yes, it was.  And chip off the old block.  So keep listening to this channel.  We've got all the details on our big Chicago broadcast.  It's going to be awesome.  Fun.  Headline, it's a week from this, a week.  What am I saying?  It's Friday.  Friday.  Holy fuck, it is Friday already.  Crazy.  This Friday.  All right, guys.  Enjoy your day.  We'll see you tomorrow.  You heard about it.  You've waited four long hours for it. 
[03:06:30]  Finally, the moment is at hand.  After opening, Anthony Life is coming up next. </pre>
