<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts engaging in graphic sexual banter, quickly transitioning to Opie's persistently leaking pool.  He detailed the extensive repairs needed, focusing on the faulty marble dust coating. This led to a discussion contrasting Opie's pool troubles with a Florida family's seemingly apathetic response to a family member disappearing into a sinkhole.  Opie then recounted receiving a package of children's artwork intended for someone in Texas, sparking speculation about potential drug smuggling.

The conversation shifted to fashion, specifically the resurgence of jean jackets and jeans, with reminiscing about past styles and brands like Jordache and Big Yank.  They critiqued a vintage Jordache commercial before launching into a scathing review of a Ryan Lochte cologne commercial featuring urine as an ingredient.  They concluded this section with criticism of New York City Mayor Bloomberg's policies and a negative review of a Robert De Niro movie trailer.

The show then heavily criticized "The Big Wedding," using extremely offensive language to describe the film and its actors, Robert De Niro and Susan Sarandon. This transitioned into a hodgepodge of unrelated topics: a car accident anecdote, reviews of *Jack Reacher*, *Iron Man 3*, and *Pain and Gain*, Brian Regan's upcoming tour, graphic listener photos of a breast injury, and a lengthy, harsh critique of radio intern Alan Thicke Jr.'s work ethic.  They also discussed Donald Trump Jr.'s Twitter comments on Anthony Weiner, a gathering of former presidents, and Jimmy Norton's weight loss.  Anthony Cumia's birthday and a banana bread gift were mentioned before the segment concluded with more personal insults between the hosts.  Ben Kingsley was mentioned as a future guest.

A significant portion focused on Alan Thicke Jr. pitching a "biggest asshole" staff vote, leading to significant behind-the-scenes chaos, including a damaged ballot box.  After a series of attempts to get Nicole, a co-host, into the studio, she arrived, possibly upset by online comments. Alan Thicke Jr. ultimately won, with the reasons for his and others' nominations read aloud.  The segment involved an awkward but successful apology to Nicole with flowers and candy, discussion of staff jealousy surrounding Nicole's popularity, Alan Thicke Jr.'s Dungeons & Dragons participation, a call about an offensive ad read, and a discussion of a restaurant's racially insensitive social media posts. The segment concluded with Alan Thicke Jr. performing a D&D song and a discussion of Opie's eye allergies.

Comedian Brian Regan then appeared as a guest. He discussed his upcoming tour, anecdotes from his stand-up career, and the annoyances of air travel. The conversation turned to the hosts' frustration with SiriusXM's scheduling policies, particularly a perceived ban on guests appearing on both their show and Howard Stern's, citing Don Cheadle as a lost opportunity.  They lamented their poor studio conditions compared to other shows, citing a broken wall and lack of support from management. They also discussed their frustration with the bureaucratic process surrounding a proposed show hashtag.  This led to a discussion with Nicole, who talked about online hate, an upcoming "elevator video," and the workplace dynamics.  The segment ended with further complaints about studio conditions and lack of management respect.

The final segment featured a heated, vulgar exchange between the hosts and Nicole, criticizing her voice and demeanor.  A caller, Sammy Pesos, suggested a filibuster-style protest against management.  The hosts and callers discussed a potential podcast and staff cuts.  A lengthy promotion of Steven Singer’s gold-dipped roses for Mother’s Day involved Alan Thicke Jr., followed by a discussion about his mistreatment regarding scheduling a bit for the aftershow, revealing details of his personal life.  Listener calls followed, including compliments for Sam Roberts' voice, criticisms, and DVD requests. The show concluded with promotion of Sam Roberts' interview with David Chase, Anthony Bourdain's appearance, and the hosts' weekend plans.

A month  A month and a half  Of the year  And then you know  And the rest of the year  It's just pitch dark  When we start our day 
[00:02:30]  It's black  It has that like  Dark blue in the sky  It's starting  A little bit  Feeling yesterday  Was nicer out  A little warmer  It could be a lot warmer  But at least it was sunny  Yeah it was nice  You know  I actually got a little chance  To take a little stroll  Through the yard yesterday  Kind of look around  Make some plans  For the summer and shit  So  Assessing the situation  Yeah yeah  Assessing the situation  The situation  It was 
[00:03:00]  Gotta pull some weeds  Out over here  Oh I don't do that  Put another bushing  Not you  But I'm just saying  Take your notes  The Mexicans do that  The Mexicans do that  You just trust them right?  Yeah  I was supposed to have  My pool open on April 1st  Yeah  But  Apparently  There's still this  Problem of a leak  You gotta leak  Well the pool's been leaking  Since I had it put in  By the worst pool company  Ever in the history  Of the world  They're terrible?  Well yeah  Horrible  And used to talk  About them 
[00:03:30]  The marble dust coating  That goes on the outside  Of a pool  You know that's like  You know what you see  Right  Was done so poorly  It's got like these  It's not literally  Cracks in it  But it looks like  It's cracked  And it's so discolored  Like it's supposed to be  A very light blue color  And then it's just  Patches of white  And shit  It just  They did a horrible job  But you know  I wanted to use the pool  So  I'd fill it up  Every year  And have a great summer  With it  But I noticed  The autofill  Was constantly running 
[00:04:00]  In the pool  So  So I  Every year  I would open the pool up  And it would be empty  It went from  You know  They would  They would lower the level  Probably two feet or so  From the top  Throw the cover on it  And the winter would  You know  Come and go  And summer would come  And I'd take the cover off  And not a drop of water  Was in the pool  Where's the water going?  I don't know  And it's a lot of chemicals  Whatever  It's 
[00:04:30]  Hundreds of thousands  Of gallons of water  Have been just lost  Over the winter  One of your neighbors  Has a slow leak  In their basement  Yeah  Leaking into their basement  And they just can't figure out  Where the water's coming from  Or something  So  Shit  This year  This year  I  Went with a new company  To  Maintain the pool  And this guy comes up  And goes to check all the lines  So he puts all the plugs in  And pressure tests  Every  Fucking pipe  Coming in and out of the pool  Right  No leaks  So he's 
[00:05:00]  No leaks  Yeah  No leaks in the pipes  So he's saying  He goes  Hey  Because the only thing  The only possibility  Is that it's seeping through  The marble dust  Oh wow  Coating  You know  It's kind of  Those little  That look like cracks  You know  There's the water  Seeping through that  Right  And  You sure you got a trusting guy  Yeah  Yeah  They're  Not looking at you like  Oh fuck  Here's my payday  No  No  No  There's a quick fix  But they're gonna go with  The other thing  With all the fucking pipes and stuff 
[00:05:30]  They are not leaking  There's no other option  You're not over a sinkhole  Are you  No  No  No  It's  You're creating a sinkhole  I'm creating a sinkhole  If the water's  Draining every fucking year  You're creating one  Giant hole in the ground  That'd be great  Huh  Yeah  So  We would find you though  We wouldn't just leave you there  Oh good  Yeah  You're too important  We wouldn't just leave you there  Like that family of Florida  Decided to do  We would leave you there  Even if we saw your ankle

[00:10:00]  Oh I lived on Elwyn  You did  Yes  But anyhow  It probably is  Either around the main drain  Or the skimmers  What these jackasses do  Is when they build the pools  And they do the gunite  Rather than waste  What's called the rebound  They throw it up  Behind the skimmers  The skimmers get out of whack  And they do it  Make sure that they  Chip and seal around  The skimmers  And the main drain  Before they do the marble dust  And you should have  No problems after that  Yeah yeah  Here's the deal though 
[00:10:30]  How does it go to  The bottom of the pool  If it's the skimmers  That's my first fucking thought  It could be the main drain  So  And they've checked  The main drains  And all the  The line would be fine  Actually how the main drain  Sits in the gun  Yeah that's what I was  I asked the guy also  And that had been checked also  Oh he did  Yeah  Yeah  Uh huh  You fill it up a little bit  And then you take some dye  When the water's all still

[00:26:00]  There actually was  Between the belly button  And the vagina  On a girl  Sure  You know  Growing up  You'd think like  Oh  It's all right in the same area  It's gotta be down there  It's pretty  You know  And then you realize  Wow  There's a lot of room  Between a girl's belly button  And when you actually  Hit fucking  You know  Ah  Pussa  Well there was a time  The belly button  You know  And then it was the hair  Right there  Our hair was right there  So the belly button  Looked like a soccer ball  In a field somewhere  You assumed the pussy  Was close  Because there was a lot of hair  It was all right there  You were in the ballpark

[00:29:00]  About my newest product exploration  My newest cologne  Pool water  Water straight from the pool  I swim in every day  Allowing anyone to smell  The chlorinated way  I smell  Fuck yeah  Dab a dab on the wrist  Dab a dab  I'm gonna resist  Triple over your head  That's what I said  Or maybe you can put  A little sprinkle tinkle  Under your nose  So just only you can smell it  It'll be our little secret  Yeah  You wanna know another little secret 
[00:29:30]  There's a special ingredient  Only I know in there  My personal signature if you will  Come on  You know what it is  This is the best take  You remember what I do in pools  Don't you  Take some shit  No  Every bottle is urine  You'll see  This one has a bit more of a gold twang to it  Why?  Because I melted my gold metals down  Incorporated them  Into the mixture  That's why they're gold  He's winking  Hey lady  I smell that

[00:30:30]  Who looks at that and goes  Wow that's pretty funny  Like who sees that and goes  That's the take we need  Yeah  Yeah Sam said it in there  That was the best take they could get from this guy  Fuck  Is it die?  It's all pegged over to die?  It has to be  Yeah  Well he's in a pool  I get it  You swam  Yeah  And he pissed in the pool  They're trying to push him forward  As a reality star  I like the wink he does  You gotta see the funny wink he does  Oh god  Melting his gold medals 
[00:31:00]  Yeah  But he surely thinks  That he's a very funny guy  Oh yes Shirley  Because he's a good looking dude  And he's a good athlete  So he's just told whatever  Yeah  Like a guy like him  Is hanging out with people  They're like  Dude you're hilarious  Yeah yeah  That pool water thing  You ought to do that  For Funny or Die  You think?  Yeah  You know that thing  You say at the party  To stairs?  You should do that in a video  Wow he stinks  Yeah  That wasn't funny at all  No not at all  Not even close  That'd be funny if Luke Costello did it

Fuck yeah Rodney  She's got like a little  Fucking bathing suit on  Alright  Too early to go to break 
[00:32:00]  Unfortunately  Unfortunately  My eye is itchy  All the commenters are not  They're being kind right?  No  Oh  People know how to be kind  On the internet  So I would assume  They're being kind to them  Nothing but polite people  That's right  You've captured  Cinema's all time  Worst wink  Says one commenter  That is bad  So  We like  Telling the rest of the country  How ridiculous our mayor is  Here in New York City  Yeah  And 
[00:32:30]  We know  Being New Yorkers  That  You know  The city's  Maybe not broke  But hurting for money  Definitely  Everyone's  Everyone's feeling the pinch  They've closed down  Firehouses  They've closed down  Schools  Yeah  And  Everything is getting  Way more expensive  Yes  So Mayor Bloomberg  Has decided that  He needs to hire  These guys  At 50,000  A pop  50,000 a year 
[00:33:00]  They make  50,000  A year  Yes  And their whole job  Is to kind of  Tell  You know  Bicyclists  Where to go  I hate this  Fucking man  And what to do  As in  One of these guys  That will be making  50,000 a year  Will all of a sudden  Pop out of nowhere  With a little stop sign  Because you might be  At a  Busy intersection  Like you can't  Figure that out  Yourself  Being a bicyclist  It's again  He's a fucking 
[00:33:30]  A woman  He's a fucking  Nanny  Woman  Out of touch  Woman  And these guys  Can't even give  You know  You a ticket  Or anything  They're just there  To kind of  Help you along  As you  As you bike  Through the city  How about  You just let people  You know  Go about their business  Let them just die  Let them get hit by a cab  If they're stupid enough  To not figure out  How to  You know  Drive a bike  In the city  Holy shit  Taxpayers are forking  Over cash  So a small army  Of city  DOT employees  Can babysit  Rogue cyclists 
[00:34:00]  Reminding them  Of the basic  Rules of the road  So they don't  Pedal into pedestrians  It's fucking  He really has  Fucked up  Traffic in the city  I hate him  I fucking hate him  The nanny  What is he doing  He's just an old  Cocksucker who gets  His own way all the time  That's all he is  But we don't have  The money for this  Start there  We don't have the money  For this  Take care of other shit  Before you get  These guys out there  He's  It's amazing 
[00:34:30]  How fucking  Intrusive he is  On everyone's life  Nearly a dozen  Department of Transportation  Workers  Some who usually  Maintain traffic signs  Were deployed to  Sparsely  Sparsely occupied  Bike lanes  On 1st and 2nd avenues  In the East Village  Yesterday  To hold up  Red stop signs  To control  Speeding cyclists  The other side  Of the sign  Displays the warning  Wrong way  The sign holders  Said they love  Their new gig  Easy gig  Yeah they're making 
[00:35:00]  50 G's  And they don't even  Have to fucking  Write tickets  Standing there  With a sign  The guy writes  This is so much  Less stress in my body  I don't have to  Lug around a ladder  To do this  Yeah good for those guys  I'm not faulting them  For having an easy gig  But it's a  It's a  A useless gig  Do you know  The DOT calls the workers  Street safety managers  Safety patrol  We got street safety managers  Out there now  They're fucking  Elementary school safety patrol  Paid $50,000  To stand in the street 
[00:35:30]  Right  The team will rotate  To different bike lane  Areas each day  And they'll be out  Until October  So then after October  Everyone goes back  To just biking  Like assholes  Yeah I guess they figured  Not many more people  Are biking in the winter  I went to park  In the fucking village  Last night  Duh  Duh sorry  And the fucking  Half the fucking block  Now on this one place  I used to park  Is taken up  By these  These fucking  You know these bike things  That cities do  Yeah  Where you  Oh that whole program  Is rolling out  Yeah  And of course  Of course 
[00:36:00]  These cocksuckers  Don't put it on  The metered side  They put it on the side  That was free parking  Uh huh  They're just  They're just fucking  Yes  They're trying to take away  As many parking spots  As possible  Yeah  That's Bloomberg  Just being a passive  Aggressive woman  On the upper east side  I get my hair cut  And I used to like  Pull up all nice  There was always  Parking on the street  A little meter parking  Yeah  Jump out  And go get my hair cut  And they took all that away  And I try to figure it out  I don't even know why  This guy is so 
[00:36:30]  All that is now  No parking  And no loading  Uh they'll also  Hit the bridges  And uh  As cyclists  And pedestrians  Do not veer  Into each other's lanes  The DOT  Said in a statement  Yesterday  So yeah  They're rolling out  The big city bike  Sharing program  Which I kind of like  I'll be honest with you  I was in Boston  Last year  And basically  You know  You jump  You use your credit card  You put your credit card  On the machine  And then you could  You could grab a bike  And then you could  Drop it off  Wherever the fuck you want  But who knows  Where these things are  Uh they have little maps 
[00:37:00]  I liked it  I mean  I think it's uh  More for tourists  And stuff  Obviously  But you jump in a city  And you want to get around  You grab one of these bikes  And then you know  As long as  You know  They got your credit card  On file  So you can't fuck up the bike  You can't steal the bike  They don't give a fuck  If you steal the bike  Because they'll just charge you  A ridiculous amount of money  On your credit card  More bikes  You know  It's like  Bicyclists say fine  But hey fuckhead  This is New York  This is not California  It's not San Francisco  Right  Exactly  He would love to be 
[00:37:30]  The mayor of San Francisco  Oh would he ever  They would love him out there too  Yeah  You've spent time out there right  Yeah  They would love all this shit  I'm telling you  But we have more people here  Sorry  It's a busier city  Than San Francisco  But then you know  He'll jump on TV  In a couple weeks  Saying how the city's broke  And you  It just  It just drives you nuts  All of his speech is like  Well  This is what we're doing  I've heard people complain  But uh  You know  We're doing what's best  For the city  It's this  Meh 
[00:38:00]  Fuck you  Here's what I do now  Yeah  All he does is  Fucking  All he does is  Push bicycling  And blindly defend Islam  Regardless of what  Somebody has just done  The first thing  This cocksucker  Says  Is uh  Don't judge  All my  First of all  Don't tell me  How to react to something  Right  You fucking woman  Exactly  Don't tell me  How to fucking feel  You cocksucker  If I want to  I will  Right  I don't need to be told that  Yeah  It's not up to you  No  And I don't  I don't do that  I don't need to be told that 
[00:38:30]  By an old billionaire woman  I don't need to be told that  By an old billionaire woman  Who didn't want to do two terms  Like every other mayor  Right  And didn't want to disregard  The will of the people  Like you did  Yeah  It's a great point  I hate him  Great point Jimmy  Great fucking point  The will of the people  He talks about  When he brings up  His dumb fucking  Cock sucking gun control issue  He talks about how  Well  90% of the people  Want  Gun control  Which is  Complete and utter bullshit 
[00:39:00]  But uh  It's 80%  How about  Yeah well  Yeah  But  How about the fact  That there was a larger percentage  Of people that did not want  A mayor to have three terms  But you didn't go through the people  You fucking went  Through the back door  Which I'm sure you're used to  And  And fucking  Got the third term  Do these politicians  Ever go through the people  Nowadays  Not when they want something  It doesn't seem like they do  When they want something  They figure out a way  To bypass it 
[00:39:30]  I hate them  No no no  We won't let the people  Vote on that  Fuckers  Now I gotta  Now I go to my go to line  I hate them all  Hate them all  They're also trying to get rid of  Well they're gonna get rid of  E-bikes  You know what an e-bike is  Jimmy Norton  I do not  There are those bikes  That go zooming by  A fat bike  There it is  I'm gonna keep track today  Oh buddy  That's the first one  E-Rock  Oh E-Rock  Um 
[00:40:00]  No it's a slow bike  And a side car  Filled with blubber  Sorry that was just mean  Wow  I didn't  I know E-Rock  Sit down  I apologize  Oh we can't play that today  Nope  Why'd you break the lead?  Yeah  You're just sitting there then  You don't have a job to do huh?  I gotta run emergency stuff  When you need it  Emergency stuff  That's scary  Yeah really  Anyway these e-bikes  They're the bikes that go flying by you 
[00:40:30]  Cause they have tiny little motors  On them Jimmy  You've seen them right?  They're a little heavier  And they go flying down the road  And the delivery guys use them  That's how we get our food so fast  In New York City  Oh  And that's why you could order  From restaurants that are  Pretty far away from where you live  Right  Cause they figured this out a while ago  It's like fuck the traditional bike  Where our guys gotta pedal  To you know  To your apartment  Yeah  They got these little motors on them  And they go  I think some of them  Can get up to like 20 miles an hour 
[00:41:00]  Well the mayor has decided  That's very very dangerous  Of course  I've never seen an issue  With an e-bike  I've been in New York  Over 10 years now  I've seen them many many fucking times  Yep  But I've never seen an issue  Not a once  And the only thing they were able to do  I guess the cops  Is if you were doing more than 15 miles per  Right  They could give you a ticket  Right  They weren't illegal  No  But if you were  I guess there's some weird rule  If you're on a bike  Going more than 15 miles an hour  They could ticket you 
[00:41:30]  Yep  But they weren't illegal  But now they're officially  Going to be illegal  He's banning these  Not even to just ride  Right  To have them  He's got a whole army of people  That are going to go out immediately  And if your restaurant has one  Even parked outside  You're going to be fined  I think between $200 and $300  But he won't ban these fucking little pedicab  The guys who are fucking riding bikes  And pulling people  Right  Which destroys traffic  Anything that fucks up traffic  Yes  This fucking jizz drinker loves 
[00:42:00]  He loves  When you're stuck  Anything that hurts traffic  When you're stuck behind one of those fucking cabs  Those little guys in bicycles  Right  They are the fucking  As far as I'm concerned  They're the worst thing with petty in their name  See  I'm assuming that pedophiles  Are even better than them  Stupid me  I was going with Tom Petty  Oh  I was going with Tom Petty  Oh  Petticoat Junction  Yeah  Yeah  It was a reach  But what are you going to do  Flying by the seat of our pants over here 
[00:42:30]  So now he's decided  It's all about  We've said it many times on the show  It's all about  You know  Just finding new revenue streams  So he knows he can get a quick hit here  Oh yeah  Find a shitload of restaurants  $200, $300 a piece  That would be a nice little day  Of collecting  See the stuff he's done that's good  Is like he gives the ratings on the fucking  On the restaurants  Like California does  And there's the calorie counts  Both of these things  Make consumers more informed  Right  And allow you to make a smarter choice 
[00:43:00]  Your own decision  Your own decision  That's fine  But when he starts thinking for everybody  Yeah  And fucking mind policing  And telling us  That's where he becomes a hateable  Yes  Hatable old woman  All these fucking  Him and the rest of these politicians  That  They always say shit like  Well it's not a mob rules  It's not a mob rules thing  We can't just let the public vote on things  And then take it at that face value  For what the  What the voters want 
[00:43:30]  Because then  You know  Let's say people vote  That they want to  Discriminate against certain people  Or something  You can't have that  So it can't just be a mob rules thing  We work in a  A constitutional republic  Then meanwhile  When they do want something  The first thing they do  Is give you poll numbers  Of how many people  Right  Want this  Well  Is it one or the other  You fuckwad  Mmhmm  And with  In Bloomberg's case  He doesn't give a shit 
[00:44:00]  What the fucking people want  He'll do whatever  He god damn well pleases  And then with his policies  He pulls the poll numbers out  Well the people  People want this  Fuck you  You mo  But these stupid restaurants  Just trying to get by  Yeah  It's tough to run a restaurant  In New York City  Because you know  The landlords  The rent goes up constantly  The rent's too god damn high  Columbus Avenue  It's just too damn high  Columbus Avenue  My area  When I first moved to New York  In 2000  Right after 9-11  Oh  So whatever 
[00:44:30]  2002  Ish  It used to be  Lying with restaurants  It was awesome  And you could sit outside  Socially it was great  You just  You know  You kind of almost bar hop  From restaurant to restaurant  You always saw people  In the neighborhood  You kind of knew  One by one  They went away  They couldn't afford it anymore  Yeah  So these guys are just trying to fucking get by  And they're trying to deliver food  A little further than they would  With a traditional bike  Uh-huh  But now the mayor  He just doesn't get this shit  No 
[00:45:00]  He doesn't understand it at all  Fuck  So  Can De Niro by the way  Stop doing shitty movies  No  Can he stop doing shitty movies  What happened Jimmy?  The big wedding he's doing now  With Dan Keaton and Catherine Heidel  This is one of these star-studded movies  That you just picture  Old fucking retirement home people  Going to see these movies  Terrible  Terrible comedy  Oh look who's in it  De Niro and Keaton  Oh  Who else  Robin Williams is in it 
[00:45:30]  And who else  It's like star-studded  Michael Keaton  No  Diane  Diane Keaton  Susan Sarandon  You said that  Susan Sarandon  Golfball-eyed Susan Sarandon  She's a looker though  They say  Oh yeah  She's sexy  They say  Is this the trailer?

Hold on  We gotta explain this shit  This is such  They're trying to sell  Susan Sarandon  As a hot piece of ass  That's the hottie  That's the first fucking problem 
[00:46:30]  And then De Niro  Was fooling around  With her  And Diane Keaton  Walked in  And he goes  Unexpected  What are you doing?  You don't want to see  Cause he was about to  Banger on the  Yeah  The counter  The kitchen counter  You don't want to see  These people  Like involved  In any kind of  Sex play  First of all  It's fucking  Ick  Unless he's Max Katie  Yeah  Listen to this  Faggoty music  Like this  Yeah  Who thinks this is  Gonna be a fucking  Funny movie  Oh that trailer  This is a typical  Again  Another typical trailer  Trailer people should be  Killed  And it's the go to music 
[00:47:00]  For a trailer  Yeah yeah  Oh it's terrible  That's the go to  These people  Who make trailers  Are fucking  Worthless hacks  The family gathers  Why are they gathering?  The wedding  The big wedding  But why would you  Invite your ex?  Unless their last name  Is gathers  And they're saying  It's like the family gathers  Oh god  That would be terrible  Would you ever invite  One of your exes  To anything?  I think it's  The kids wedding  Oh I see 
[00:47:30]  Then you have to  Yeah the ex-wife  Oh I see  Oh there could be  Problems with this  And who play the kids  What attractive couple  Plays the kids  Katherine Heigl  And who else?  Topher Grace  Topher Grace  Okay good  The guys I bet you  They figure out  Their problems  By the end of the film  Bet they do  I bet it all works out  In the end  You know what?  In the end  What's important is family  And love  And this is  This picture in the paper  Of Katherine Heigl 
[00:48:00]  Facing away  And De Niro  Sitting behind  Talking to her  I guess they're  On the diving board  And he's not  Wearing any socks  And it's where  He's explaining  We both love you  But your mother's  A cunt  I need love  Love  Oh I hate these  Let's see more  I will never see this  I will never see this  I would just to hate it  Never  I want to go to the opening  I want to go and just watch people laugh in the theater  Yeah  You would see this just for the goof  No  I never saw like  Oh what's the last movie

[00:49:00]  That it's going to be  It's got to be a hit  And they stink  What they're doing  It's a formula that obviously works for Hollywood  Yes  So they keep going back there  Yikes  And I know De Niro's making a lot of money  But it's like you're De Niro  You can choose any script you want man  That's the beauty of him  All he does is refuse scripts all day  Yeah  No no  Huh  No family  Okay  What was the first one  Meet the parents  Eeny meeny

[00:50:00]  And then occasionally he delves into you know  Yeah get it  Analyze this  No he decided this is what he has to do now  That's his fucking forte now  Yeah he has to do comedies  He was born to do comedies  Well let's see it  Alright  I truly loathe this place  Sweetheart  Dad  You look breathtaking  You've pecked on a few  Pause  She's a cunt like her mother  Conflict number one

[00:51:30]  Well of course  Man she's fucking  She's beautiful  Amanda Seyfried  She's the one  We saw her tits yesterday  Oh yeah  She has really juicy  Fuckable lips  Fucking linger longer  That's right  We saw her on skin  Mr. Skin there  She is very very attractive  She's ample  Yeah  She's a kissable  Why doesn't  Why don't they have  A fat ugly daughter  And a fucking piece of shit  Like son  That are getting together  Because nobody in Hollywood  Can care about those people  Right  The group that gets together  The most  And talks about 
[00:52:00]  Don't undervalue  Don't use the N word  Don't use the R word  Yes  Body image  What are we doing  To our children  With body image  Boy they cannot show  Ugly people  No  I've mentioned it before  Even in Shallow Howl  With Jack Black  They had to use  Gwyneth Paltrow  The most beautiful woman  In the world  To make the point  About that fucking  Fat pig  That Jack was supposed to like  They couldn't even  Get a fat girl  To make a social point  About body image 
[00:52:30]  Yes  These fucking fakes  Girl phonies  I know  I have a raging heart  On right now too  For this girl  I know right  Big eyes  Ample boobs  He is  Nice  Yeah  Long straight blonde hair  To rub your penis in  Jesus Jimmy  Once again  Over the cliff  Over the cliff  Oh god  Do you know what  Your son just told me  Al's biological mother  Is under the impression  That divorce  Is a great big fat sin  Hell it is then  That's a pretend  I'm married I bet  She gave up her only son 
[00:53:00]  So that I could have a chance  At a better life  And now she left Columbia  Only to find out  That I've been lying  About being raised by heathens  For the past 15 years  No offense  I'm taking it  Wait where  I know what happened  Here hold on  He left his biological mother  Right  And I guess De Niro  And um  Whatever  Are his uh  Diane Keaton  Diane Keaton  Her step parents  Is some shit  But there's adopted parents  Yeah  They adopted this kid  But wouldn't that be a sin  That the mom gave up  Her son  Well she did this  So he could have a better life  They're building in the story perfectly 
[00:53:30]  It's not like she was a drug addict  Hooker  You know who was  Fucking ballooning heroin  This is of course  A likable  And empathy  Driven back story  Always  To help the child  Help the child  Not that she was a cunt  It's not abandoning  Now she's leaving  To come to the wedding  Right  And instead of just going  Fuck you  I fell out of your pussy  And they raised me  Right  He's embarrassed  That they're not married anymore  Oh boy  So they're probably  Gonna have to pretend  They're married  But so she was married  When she gave birth  To this kid  Don't know  It hasn't been explained yet  Whatever it is  It's likable 
[00:54:00]  That's stupid  It's likable and explainable  Alright  So you got the adopted son  With the  Biological mom  Coming to town  Oh boy  No offense  None taken  How many times  Has that been used  And they're really  Gonna go with the angle  That they gotta make believe  They're married  I'm guessing  For a weekend  For the marriage  For this fucking mother  Who gave up her son  Oh my god  Just to make this  This fucking  Pukey adopted son happy  What happens if they realize  They're in love  Uh oh  That they never lost  Oh you think 
[00:54:30]  There's gonna be  Two weddings in the end  Yuck  How great would it be  If they just threw a curveball  And as the wedding  Is happening  You see the ambulance  Pulling Diane Keaton  Out with a fucking  Sheet over her head  Because he bludgeoned her  With a lamp  Like the night stalker  And they take De Niro  Out in cuffs  And he's like  That fucking cunt  I couldn't take  That fucking cunt  While the wedding  Is happening  And that's the end  Of the movie  Just completely  The fucking rubes  In the audience  Are just horrified  At what they're saying  Why can't Hollywood 
[00:55:00]  Do that just one time  Just to take one  Of these stupid  Cute comedies  And really just  Go off the rails  How great would that be  I need love  Love  He's got blood  In his fucking fingers  And his beard  Someone needs to do  That movie  He bit one of her tits off  And spit it at her  You would find  An audience for that  If you took that  Horrendous left turn  After this cutesy  Fucking set up  This is what's gonna happen  Because Hollywood's  Never done this before  The initial wedding  Yeah  They're gonna get married  Yeah  Then they're gonna have  A fast forward 
[00:55:30]  Where the parents  Are now married  And he's got  His little kids around  Oh you think  Yeah  And the Colombian mother  Has found peace  Right  In the fact that  She helped them  Oh god  Hey there  Pretend to be married  For the weekend  What's the big deal  Oh we nailed it  You're still married  What does that make me  My concubine  Oh  What the hell did I do  Why don't you ask your wife  Guys  What  Estos  Estos  Son  Estos  Papas  Don  Yale 
[00:56:00]  Gracie  Um  Estro  Y casa  I don't speak it  I don't know how to speak it properly  Hi  Hi  Hi  Hi  Hi  Hi  Hi  Hi  Hi  Hi  Hi  Hi  Hi  Hi  Hi  Hi  Hi  Wow  Yeah  Wow  That's right  Kowtow to the whimsy  Of this fucking absentee hole from Columbia  Right  Why don't you tell her to speak fucking English  Absentee hole  Yeah  A we have to pretend we're married  And B feel bad that we don't speak  How about you fucking show up with an interpreter 
[00:56:30]  For her  Shit tits  Yeah  Tell her go fuck yourself  Who's going through all this shit  Exactly  Yo  Roland Spado  Sounds like the straight version of the birdcage  Wasn't that kind of the thing in the birdcage  Where they had to make believe they weren't gay or something  Yeah but that was a funny movie though  It was funny  Terrible  You're right it was funny  So now the mom comes and they gotta make believe they're married and that pisses off  Susan Saran and she can't go with the thing that they're fucking married for the weekend  That's why she said ask your wife like she's really believing that thing now 
[00:57:00]  Yeah  This looks good  I said to De Niro go well we're sorry that this happened but we took care of you  And we don't care what this woman thinks  Exactly  We don't care what she thinks  Tell this cunt to sit in the back and have a margarita  Right  I'll plant my foot right in her fuck  She probably raises Pablo Escobar's animal since he died  Fuck her  Fuck her  Wow  Why would they do this  I don't know  Let's find out though  Cause you know the trailer gives away everything  Yeah  This house is so beautiful she says  Let's see what she finds wrong with it 
[00:57:30]  Oh my goodness I have such wonderful taste  Welcome to Weeple on Country Club  I will be your captain this evening  I'll have the chalet mignon  Don't think so  Oh boy  She's pissed off  Oh boy  She was pretending to be a waitress  Cause she's the scorned mistress  And the fucking  They're ordering it  And De Niro goes  I want the  With the flaming on  She goes  I don't think so  She drops the menu  And the other lady's like 
[00:58:00]  What the heck  Drops the menu right in his lap  And  Oh that's  That's a funny scene right there  And De Niro's just gonna put up with this shit  Even though I saw it in the trailer  I'll probably still laugh when I see it in the movie  Absolutely  Cause they don't tell you enough  What would be funny  Is if he goes  Do you call them carrots  And he flipped the table over  And punched her in the fucking face  That would be funny  Why do they do these movies  It's utter fucking garbage  I hope they lose 
[00:58:30]  Mainstream media just loves this shit  No they're killing it  They're killing it  Yeah but they'll still go see it  For whatever reason  People will  People are doped  But they get murdered on this one  Number one at the box office  Is the wedding this weekend  How many stars in the paper  One  One star  One star  Which I don't always give credit to  But you know sometimes they're right  What did the other paper give it  I didn't really  I just happened to see this  We're about Rotten Tomatoes  Alright we'll get there eventually  Let's get to the end of the trailer here  Alright  Well I'm through the cast 
[00:59:00]  You know I've stayed away from you  For all these years  Because I'm your daughter  Jared got mom straight  And I won the lottery  With all of you  You were in love with Don Griffin  From the first time I introduced you  Well then why don't you just  Run me over with your car  Or something  You were my best friend  That's what I like about you  That's what I like about you  They show you every part of this  It must be very comforting  To know that not everybody hates you  Keep up  Would somebody just please  Punch me in the face again  Oh yeah everyone in the audience 
[00:59:30]  Wants to  Holy shit  What is it  He won't say no to a movie  No  And what does it say  Click to watch the ultimate  Pain and gain trailer  What is that  Is that for another movie  Yeah pain and gain  Yeah that's with the rock  The rock  Oh of course  Marky mark  Of course  You know what movie might be good though  Iron Man 3  Oh yeah  Which we have  Because I guess we have  Ben Kingsley next week  We couldn't get Don Cheadle today  The big wedding  Wait we got Ben next week  We do yeah  But I guess we can't  Don Cheadle's coming in at 10  And we can't get him on the show  Wow 
[01:00:00]  I don't know why  We'd stay late for Don Cheadle  Wouldn't we  We love Don Cheadle  We treated him great when he was in  I don't know why we can't get him  He had fun  Yeah he did  He was great  He was on for what  Five minutes maybe  Yeah it was a stop in  He had some laughs  He was very very nice  He was very cool  And we cannot get him booked  Back on the show  Alright we're on Rotten Tomatoes  First of all  What's the overall rating for the movie  Four  Four  Wow  Okay  Four percent  And what's the 81 percent  How's that  Wait go back  81 percent  I mean that's audience  But that's gotta be such a small group 
[01:00:30]  Because it's not out yet  Yeah okay  Yeah that scared me  But go to the  The Fresh Tomato  There's a person that actually liked the movie  What do they say  Roger Moore from Movie Nation  Roger Moore  Broad, coarse, and crude  But bottom line  A lot of good actors  Land more  Than a few laughs  I doubt that  Yeah he's a  I doubt that  He gave it  Three stars  Almost three stars  Two and a half  Two and a half  Yeah  What a fucking piece of shit  Who else gave it a fresh show 
[01:01:00]  Just that guy  He made the four percent  Oh  Alright  Give me a bad review  Maybe one that really is  Seattle Times  It's a mess  And not in a good way  Los Angeles Times  It's like many big weddings  A lot of things go wrong  And not much goes right  Newsday  This movie plays like an episode  Of Gilligan's Island  Done as  Straight as an episode of Lost  Wow  New York Times  The screenplay is chopped up  Into smutty sound bites 
[01:01:30]  And constructed around the notion  That casual obscenity  Delivered by respected actors  Of a certain age  Is hilarious  But it's just embarrassing  Nice  Yeah that pretty much wraps it up  Yep  Yeah  Hollywood Reporter  A game cast  And lots of gamey  R-rated shenanigans  Can't compensate  For the silly comic  Controvances  Don't know what that is  Contrivances  Dunce  I don't know  Contrivances  Contrivances  Controvances  I like it that better that way 
[01:02:00]  Controvances  Yeah  They dominate the big wedding  Like Epitome  Yeah  The fucking Hollywood Reporter  Going for a big word  Fuck that  Fuck that  USA Today  It might take a glass of champagne  Or two  To get through the big wedding  He tied the review into the  That's a great newspaper  Friday, Saturday, Sunday  That's a really relevant newspaper  Which issue is this?  It's a Friday, Saturday, Sunday edition  Fucking asshole piece of shit  They still can't figure that out  No  They stink  There was a time that kind of made sense  But not in this new world 
[01:02:30]  Three days  You can't have a paper that lasts three days  That covers three days of your news  USA Today sucks  Film Journal International  Comedy about a wedding  Where the groom's divorced parents  Must pretend to still be married  The production should have been annulled  Whoa  Nice  Oh, they tied in wedding shit  Another wedding thing there  Pacino's at least doing real roles  Like he's playing Phil Spector  He played Kevorkian  Like he's trying to do all these challenging things  Yeah, but he also was in Adam Sandler's movies  He'll do some terrible movies too  But I'm saying  I was in Simone 
[01:03:00]  Overall, he's trying  De Niro just wants  He's like semi-retired  He's just getting these quick, you know, paydays  You don't give a fuck  Yeah  Gotta respect that in a way, I guess  But he's been doing it for years  Yeah  It's a terrible movie  He's terrible  He's terrible  He should dip back into some real roles  What was his last real role, De Niro?  Silver linings  And that was  He was just alright in that  Yeah  I felt like I was watching De Niro the whole time 
[01:03:30]  Yeah  You know what I mean?  You want to, like, forget that  He looks like he's just walking through this movie too  This one?  He doesn't  He doesn't act  He probably filmed it in a weekend  Yeah  Yeah, they usually  A couple weeks maybe  When they get that many big stars together  Yeah  They don't have any time  The scheduling and everything  So they wind up shooting it, like you said  Yeah, on a weekend  Well, the best one was  The third Meet the Parents, I think  That was Meet the Fockers  Meet the Fockers  No, no  Little Fockers 
[01:04:00]  Little Fockers, right  Oh boy, they couldn't  You look at that  We're saying, fuck again, people  Look, look  And remember, we dissected that movie  It turned out that they weren't even on set together  Yeah  You could tell they have that shot of, like, fucking  One of them comes walking through the front door  Hi, I'm here  And it's just the dead-on straight shot  Right  There's no one around her  Right  Because it was done in some fucking studio somewhere  Yeah, they thought that was a good idea  And it was so obvious that they weren't with each other a lot of the time  And then we learned, I think, they were able to get them on set for 
[01:04:30]  I think it was  I'm trying to remember now  Maybe two days  Yeah  Three days tops  Yeah  It just didn't work  It fucked up the whole franchise  But he's got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight movies coming out  Who?  De Niro  Wow  He's awful  She's still pissed  Yeah, she is  She's talking to a wall 
[01:05:00]  Sorry  Mashup Nicole just walked by and gave us all the luck  She looks very pretty  Is she angry?  Yeah, she's still pissed  I guess she took down her Selena Gomez picture  Yep  Oh, she did, yeah  Yeah, she did  She's really mad, though  Yes  Why is she so mad?  People don't like that  People don't like  We were nice to her, though  No, you weren't  You encouraged the audience  I didn't encourage anybody  That's what happens when we  I absolutely didn't encourage anybody to do that 
[01:05:30]  Point out things and then read negative comments  It encourages more people to write them  Oh, they're easily influenced by us?  Yes  Um, I saw last night  I saw that, uh, Jack Reacher movie  Ooh  You know what?  As far as just mindless, fucking senseless violence movie  I didn't mind it  It wasn't all that bad  Yeah?  No, it's over the top, you know  Like cornball, tough guy dialogue and shit 
[01:06:00]  But you know what?  Didn't mind it  I've seen where  I saw that in a theater when I was in Buffalo  It was better than I thought it was going to be  I still don't like it, though  That's what, you know  It was better than I thought it was going to be  I like the opening sequence there  Where these guys blasting people with the fucking sniper rifle  That's kind of cool  Yeah, I didn't mind that one  I don't get to go to movies anymore  Oh, no, I got it at my house  Was it on demand? 
[01:06:30]  Yeah  Oh  It's on demand, I demanded it  I don't get to see movies in my house  Oh, no  No  You got to stop and put in like some cartoony thing  Yeah  Oh, God  So as you see  You're watching a movie or a cool show  And you're really into it  Like Vice is a good example  Yeah  I was watching Vice  Actually, this happened with Vice  And you're not thinking anything  The kid's in the room with you  You know, we got a nice big fucking living space  Living room area  And then all of a sudden you kind of 
[01:07:00]  You know, you look over  And you see the kid looking at the TV  Horrified  You're like, oh, okay  His little almost three-year-old brain  Can't fucking grasp that shit  Can't figure this shit out yet  Next thing you know, you throw on Spongebob again  Yeah  But now people tell me Spongebob is pretty fucking adult  Yeah  I didn't see it that way  So now you're going to fucking go back to Caillou probably  Caillou  When I was out in Colorado with Buddy and Jen  At Buddy and Jen's house  Yeah  It was during like right when the second Gulf War there kicked off 
[01:07:30]  And I was watching it, you know  Yeah, yeah  I want to know everything that's going on  First time you got to see war on TV  Shock and awe  No, it was the second one  Oh  Yeah, so it was, you know, shock and awe and shit  And I'm watching  And then like, you know, the kids would be  So Jen would just come in and be like  Oh yeah, I can click and put it  And all of a sudden there's fucking like  Kid cartoons on  I'm like, oh no  It's the worst  I got to see the war  It's the worst  It's so frustrating  I can't imagine that  I'm selfish  I like seeing what I want to see 
[01:08:00]  I'll go into another room and watch my shit  Yeah  But  Not a two hour movie though  I could get a quick half hour in maybe  Alright, we should break  We got Brian Regan calling today  Our old pal, he's been with us forever  Hey  I think he's announcing a huge tour  Oh  A theater tour  Is he coming to our area?  43 cities  Second leg of Brian Regan's 2013 theater tour  Holy fuck  The second leg  His wife fucking nailed him 
[01:08:30]  That's what that says  That says that divorce was quite costly  I don't see anywhere near us  What?  I see Maui  He's going to Hawaii  Maui?  Let me see  Oregon  It's the My Wife of Cunt tour  He's going to Rochester  Rochester  Maybe go up to see Brother Weez and check out Brian Regan  Westbury he'll be at  So that's probably the closest as I look here  I just want to hear him do bitter divorce jokes now 
[01:09:00]  You think he'll go in that direction?  Yeah, you know  Big Yellow wants her attorney  Big Yellow wants her attorney  Yeah, after paying all the legal fees  All I got left is a cup of dirt  I was next and that was mine  I swear  God damn it  That's all I got left is a cup of dirt  I was going to go with  Fuck  Cup of dirt  All right, we'll take a break

[01:20:30]  During his campaign  And what  What he wanted to have enacted  And  And his plans  And hopes  And stuff like that  And then you turn around this corner  And there's a giant beam  From the World Trade Center  All twisted and shit  And that's supposed to  Kind of symbolize  How all that stuff  Went out the fucking window  Right  And he had to deal with that  For you know  Eight years  The rest of the  His uh  Terms  Yeah  Well not eight  But uh  How long into his presidency  Yeah it was very fucking close  What was it  Like 2000  Yeah 
[01:21:00]  Yeah  So he was a year in probably  Almost a year  Yeah  It pretty much got rid of doing everything  That uh  He had planned  And uh  You know  That's that  But uh  It's good to see you know  An ex-president  That's uh  Doing well  He's alright  It's always cool to see  All the ex-presidents together  That's very rare  Carter was fucking  Wearing sunglasses  The whole time  I don't know what that was about  He might have an idea  He's in his 80s  He is old  Yeah but he's still  He's still  I know  He's still doing alright man  Because of those  Habitat for Humanity

[01:28:30]  And they do that little like group dance thing and then and then he's hung over in bed  He wakes up and he feels his dick, see if he fucked anyone I guess  And then he gets up in his underwear  Why are we listening to this, E-Rock?  I don't know  Trying to figure it out

Yes, but it's not on 54  Oh, that's right  They couldn't even figure that out  Yeah, why would it be?  Why would it be on 54?  So easy  What's on 54 that's more important than the Studio 54 channel? 
[01:29:30]  Yeah  What could possibly be more important?  What could it move?  Maybe they don't have a 54  Is that what the problem is?  Who knows?  Huh?  Studio 54 radio is on channel 15  Oh  There are five  So they got half of it  But what's on 54?  Let's see  Yeah  I went to that Studio 54 party  Remember that they had?

[01:36:30]  First of all  First of all  We got a situation  It's a very difficult situation  About to go down  First of all  Yeah  I've given this kid so many opportunities  I see him out there sleeping  Like literally like head down sleeping  Nice  And I said to him  I said look  I've seen them fire interns  On the spot  Wow  On the spot  I'm like dude  Wake the fuck up  That is so unprofessional  If you can't keep your eyes open  Go the fuck home  And he was bitching 
[01:37:00]  I was like well I didn't sleep much  I said I'm like  Dude I DJ all night  And I stay up  And I come right into work  Wait he actually said  Hold on hold on  He actually said  I didn't sleep much  Yeah  That's what's going on  With the youth today  As long as they don't sleep too much  On the job  That's cool  Oh my god  If I slept once  On the way up  I would have been fired  I think he meant the night before  Huh  He said I didn't sleep much  The night before  Which is why  Last night  Yeah but I'm also hearing  From E-Rock  That he does sleep on the job  And we have pictures and videos  Oh yeah  I see him sleeping 
[01:37:30]  Right on here  I was confused  Where's the video and pictures  I've never seen it  Hold on  We've actually  I've talked about it before  Sometimes while the show is happening  Yeah  There's a whole other show  The E-Rock show happens  In the booth  That you guys don't even know about  Is this going to be one of the podcasts  Maybe it should be  Because I'll be sitting here  You know  Listening to you guys  Sleepy boy  And I'll get E-Rock's voice  In my headphones saying  Sam  Look at the window  And I turn around  And Sal and E-Rock  Are getting ready to surprise  Alan Thicke Jr. 
[01:38:00]  Because he's a sleepy boy  In the other room  He's sitting at the computer asleep  I love sleepy boy  He is asleep right there  So I've told him numerous times  I'm like dude  Wake the fuck up  What are you doing  He's tired dude  So then he comes in late  You know  He's just  Wow  I just keep trying to give him  Chance after chance  But he's just a fucking jerk off  Oh  A jerk  He just rolled his eyes  A little bit  You make it sound like  I have righteous indignation  About sleeping  I always feel like a shithead  Whenever I do fall asleep  I'm not doing it on purpose  Well I mean 
[01:38:30]  Well that's a good excuse  It's true  Do you want a job  Your future boss will understand that one  Do you want a job  What do you want to do for a living  Do you want to work in radio  Yeah  Like what job  What boss would tolerate that  Sleep studies  Exactly  The sleepy show  If you were a boss  Would you want your fucking  Your dude sitting out there  Sleeping in front of  Guests are walking by  And everybody's walking by  And you're out  Somebody's out cold  I don't have any resentment against you  I mean  You shouldn't  You shouldn't  If anybody's trying to  Fucking help your dumb ass  It's been me  I even thanked you 
[01:39:00]  Later on that day  For yelling at me  Yeah  And I yelled at him  I yelled at him  I love him  He's great  I'm telling you  I love Alan  I yelled at him  No issue with Alan  I'm like  Dude  Wake the fuck up  And he's like  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  And then I come back  20 minutes later  And he's back asleep  He said he was sorry  Yeah man  That's when  And then that's when  Sal was taking this picture  He said he was sorry  Yeah  So then I asked him  He comes up to me  And he's like  Do you need anything  I said yes  As a matter of fact  I do  I'm building some production  For phone

[01:44:30]  Right  I love Alan  I have no problem with him  I don't know why  I have him on the action show like every day  He's my co-host  I don't mind him either  I just wish he  If he's gonna ask me  You said he hasn't showered in two months  And he's lazy  Oh man  Alan  Comment  I showered  What's today  Friday  I showered  I showered on Wednesday  Oh Jesus  Yeah I know  I know  I know  I stink  That's why I'm wearing a sweater right now  Do you think I want to wear a sweater right now  It's fucking hot outside  Or a hoodie  Or a hoodie 
[01:45:00]  Yeah I just  I don't  I just don't want to like expose my fucking stinky flesh to the world right now  I saw Nicole from the mashup earlier today  I hid inside the office until she passed by  Jerking off  Well  Yeah sleeping  Taking a nap  Why'd you hide?  Did you smell that bed?  Well I don't know  I don't know if I smell that bed  You can't smell your own stench  But I assume I do  She complimented him  And he jerked off  Thinking of her  Oh  Yeah this is after show stuff  Nice  She said I would do him  And then he went home and masturbated  Just thinking about that 
[01:45:30]  She told me she'd have  Apparently in his own hair  And that was fucking Thursday  Yeah would you come on your head or something?  Oh god  She's just trying to interject himself  Wait I want to hear about the jerk off story  Yeah  On my 21st birthday  I met Nicole from the mashup  And she said something along the lines of that  Where'd you meet her?  In here  In a liquor store  In front of a coke dealer  Exactly  Where did you step over her? 
[01:46:00]  Where would she pass out?  That's insane  So you met her in here and what happened?  And she said something along the lines of that she thought I was cute  And that she would have sex with me  If she was given the opportunity  Damn  And so I immediately went home and masturbated  You got him  You got him  That's right  In your fantasy what happened?  I told her this  My problem is I can't just jerk off to my fantasies  Not anymore  Not since I've had this exposure to this cornucopia of porn 
[01:46:30]  Like on Pornhub  Oh so you got to look at something  Yeah  So she was like really just the key that got my engine going  Fair enough  What were you looking at on the computer?  Hold on I love asking this  What were you looking at on the computer when you finally nutted?  Selena Gomez fucking picture with the  Children  What was the porn you were watching?  I think this one was two chicks and one dude  So it was like it was you know a nice long like 20 minute blowjob scene  Oh that's good  And then one girl was eating out the other girl while she was getting done from behind  Oh nice  He says I think 
[01:47:00]  I think it was  I think it was  Yeah he's got the details  Troy Kwan wouldn't know about that type of porn would he?  No it's because it's his life  That's what Troy does in real life  You alright with Troy Kwan or what?  No I like Troy Kwan  You don't resent him right?  I don't resent him  I actually appreciate  Troy has actually done more for me than most people around the show  Wow  He's taught me like a lot of  Tolerance for gays  Yeah  Exactly  He's really taught me how to use the audio at his software  How to come fast when Nicole walks by 
[01:47:30]  Who's been the least helpful?  Starts with an E ends with rock  No E-rock's been good to me  Of course  No E-rock's good with the interns  There's not a single person here that I'd say who's done the least for me  But the least  I mean if somebody's done the most somebody's done the least  Someone has to have done the least right?  Sure  It's got to be on air  It's got to be us right?  It has to be  Of course  We say hello but I don't know  I just started saying hi to him about a week ago 
[01:48:00]  You guys did me gratification for my job  Okay I haven't said anything  So you guys are on the bottom  I don't know  I didn't even know he was  Did you know that he was Alan Thicke Jr.?  No  I just knew him as Alan  I know he works here  You knew him as Alan?  Yeah finally  Did you know him as Alan?  No but I know he's here  Because I had no idea who you were  Yeah  I didn't know you were the Alan Thicke Jr.  I listened on the radio but you know  It's so nice to put a face with the name  You don't get it  Anthony doesn't get attached to the  No I look at you guys like replacements in the NAMM 
[01:48:30]  Yeah  I don't  Because you know you'll probably end up with your head fucking exploding  Flooded on a rock somewhere  He looks at you the way fucking  The way Leonardo DiCaprio looked at Broomhilda in Django  I've listened on the after show  Very entertaining  Definitely  So what happens now?  I'm waiting for my clips  Yeah I was thinking about it last night  About what I should look up 
[01:49:00]  I'm going to go check out some crankier stuff  Do you think the problem is  That you're shitty  Or that you haven't been taught properly?  It's not that he's shitty  He's just exhausted  Because FUV is way more important to him  Than the Opie and Anthony show  Is it a smart choice do you think?  No  Not really a smart choice  That's not true either  So is it the shitty thing  Or the not being taught well?  Couldn't you work at FUV like  During normal hours?  Sure of course  So you can get some Z's  Not necessarily 
[01:49:30]  After I'm done with this show  I have class generally until around 9pm  How many of those classes do you sleep through?  Like I don't know  Like two of them pretty regularly  Until 9pm?  Yeah  This guy loves his sleep  Yeah he does  Until  No it's usually because  I tend to have like about a two hour break  Between my first class and second class  What's your major?  I'm a marketing major  At the business school  Shouldn't you present yourself better if you're in marketing? 
[01:50:00]  There's one person that's a salesman here  It's Alan Thicke Jr.  There you go  He gets eight hours of sleep  One hour at a time  Right  He gets his eight hours in  But fuck  Yeah what are you selling?  Fucking pillows?  Fucking chip  He just  Fucking  Puts  Throws water on a fucking spark  Speaking of Nicole  Why is she avoiding us?  She pissed at you 
[01:50:30]  Does she have time to come in?  Let's try to smooth things on  Yeah  Just kick the door in  Say you tits  Get in here  Tits McGillicuddy  I think we don't  Alan Thicke Jr.  Unless you've got something to add  Alan you gotta shit on the people that you don't like  You know  Don't be polite  You've been kind of  Been shitting on me for like the past couple of months  Wow  The guy that gives him air time  No no  I love  I love Sam  I love Sam  Thanks a lot  I love Sam  But I had this bit idea prepared 
[01:51:00]  Since the beginning of February  And every day  Every day  He's like  Oh you wanna  You wanna talk about your bit today?  I'm like  Yeah sure  And I come in  And then he fucks him  And then he just  Then he's like  Well I guess we'll do it tomorrow  For two months you've been  Since February  Sam what a cock  Well you guys know  Since February  You guys are in the business  You guys understand that sometimes you're on a roll  Oh you can't get to the thing you're planned on  So often  The actor show is just so packed  With stuff going on  One day  The actor show had an eight minute show  Sam was like 
[01:51:30]  I promise you  Today  We will cover your bit  I'm like  Alright cool  I come in  We talk about fucking phone screening  For the entire eight minutes  Oh  Folks  Can we  You wanna hear his bit?  I would love to fucking blow up Sam's bit here  I know it's a great bit  I know it's a great bit  But what if  I mean  Bit meaning what Sam's doing  But what if  Alan actually has a good bit  Has a good bit  Guess what  It's not a bad bit  Pitch the idea  Pitch the idea for us  On the big show  This is the big show right here  Alright  I noticed early and often 
[01:52:00]  That everyone here  Seems to yell at each other  And has some sort of animosity  Towards each other  So I decided  Wouldn't it be fun  If we voted  Who was the biggest asshole of the week  Alright  So I made this cardboard box  And with like a bunch of little votes on it  And we all vote  Like say  Let's just say  Sam was being the biggest asshole of the week  What?  Just saying  So let's say  We thought you were the biggest asshole  Or Sal was  Or Erock  Or whoever  You write down  Sam's the biggest asshole of the week  Because 
[01:52:30]  He  I don't know  He showed up late  Like three hours to work  On Wednesday  And whoever gets the most votes  Has to read off  On the air  Why they're the biggest cock of the week  At the end of the week  It's not a bad idea  It's not bad  Not pitched  Great  But the idea  When you get there  Is not bad  Well he's in marketing  I thought he pitched it pretty well  You do?  Yeah  So  I don't know  That's kind of weird  That this is the first time  I actually mentioned it  I didn't think that  This was going to happen 
[01:53:00]  I'd have to make that fucking better  Whoever reads their thing  Then they got to do a funny dance  Or something  Holy shit  Holy fuck  Alan Fink Jr. was trying so hard  To get his bit  Right on the air  Yeah  The other day  On the after show  I forget what we were talking about  And he just goes  He's got his box next to him  Because he's got the bit already  And he goes  You know Sam  Speaking of assholes  There's a lot of assholes around  I go Alan  We'll get to that later 
[01:53:30]  Why don't we do it today?  Let's do it  Get the box  Alright I'll get the box  Do we vote?  Who is she?  We're not behind the scenes  I think this is more of a behind the scenes thing  Yeah  Seems like behind the scenes  Because it seems like a whole fucking world  Is happening while we're broadcasting  There is  So who votes?  Who do you think votes Sam?  Well I mean  The way it was pitched to me  I would think the behind the scenes staff  Okay  So that would be me  Troy, Travis  E-Rock  Sal  Mars  I guess Mars  People forget that Mars is part of the crew 
[01:54:00]  And Roland of course  I mean if you guys wanted to vote  You could of course  Yeah but we don't really know what goes on  Like you guys do all sorts of shit after we're  I don't know  Yeah we really do  I don't want to taint the vote  And fuck up his bit  We gotta fill our time with something you know  What's going on with Troy?  He can't get Nicole in here I guess huh?  He's not good at this stuff  She might be on the air  No they only talk a couple minutes every once in a while  Yeah  Every now and again  Troy's been gone a few minutes  Can't be that 
[01:54:30]  Sam  How good are you Sam?  Could you convince her to come in here you think?  Yeah I think I could  And we're gonna be nice  We're gonna smooth things over  Depending on what Troy said  I mean Troy is not  We have to vote too by the way  We vote  I don't have a vote though  Oh here comes Troy  Alright  Troy  Did it go well?  She's not having it  For real what?  She's like I'm on the air  I can't come over right now  Oh my god  We're good  I said will you stop by in a little bit? 
[01:55:00]  She's like maybe  Oh okay  That's promising  I don't think she's going to  She's very pissed  She's really pissed  She finally probably read a lot of those comments  Yeah that's why she deleted the picture  Wasn't happy  Well we're gonna smooth things over today aren't we?  No I don't think she's gonna come in  What is he doing?  He put all  He has special  I didn't do that  Cell did  He has special asshole of the week papers  Right  And they were all blank put in the box 
[01:55:30]  Right  So then he  The box that he already taped up  So then he had to cut the box open  To get the papers out  The plan is like  You have to cut it open at the end of the week anyway  So you can pull out all the votes  Right  And then I just tape it back up again  And it's not  It's not  It's taped  That's a waste of tape  Why you don't  Why you don't trust people?  No  He's taping up his box  I definitely  I definitely believe that  He doesn't want any hanging chads  No no  I know  I know for a fact that  That  Immediately people will start skewing the votes 
[01:56:00]  So I'm pretty sure  Sal and Roland will get together  And be like  Alright we're going to make 8,000 votes for E-Rock  But look  You got a slot over there  I think they could kind of like  Shake votes out  And put other votes in  You can stick your hand in the fucking slot  Yeah exactly  I don't know  It's kind of hard  Oh shit  No  He's got his hand in there  Troy did it  Troy did it  But he's used to fisting gentlemen  Try grabbing that paper  Try grabbing that paper  At the bottom  Based on his haircut  There's a paper on the bottom  Try grabbing it  He goes try grabbing it 
[01:56:30]  Oh  Oh you ripped the box  Oh he milked  That was his bid  Oh man  How much time did he spend on the box?  I mean it probably took me like 5 minutes to make  It's not that hard  Yeah he's  Dude  But he's kept the box for the last 2 months  He's been carrying it around  And then Troy ripped it and threw it at him  Oh  Troy  What a bully  That is bullying  You can tape it back up  It's fine  Let's vote  I like voting  I like to have a voice  Alright  Pass out the cards Alan  And you can vote for as many people as you want  You just can't vote for the same person twice 
[01:57:00]  Oh here  And pass this over to Gregorio  Uh huh  I don't know if I can vote  Can I have one more for the co-host?  It's been around  Here let me have one that's not rank long  Thank you  You can have  You can think that somebody's an asshole  Like for instance  You can say Mars  For talking into my ear  While I was trying to have a conversation earlier  Oh  What was he saying?  Remember when Opie shushed him?  Oh right  Yeah he does humiliate him  So you write down the person  Right?  The asshole  The asshole  And then you write  Why they're an asshole  Right  And it could be anyone  What?  Associated with the Opie and Anthony show  Correct  Exactly  Yeah 
[01:57:30]  It can't just be somebody in the building  Like fuck  No no  It has to be associated  And the  I need a pen  Oh  Can we vote for Nicole?  Why would you?  I was just asking  It's not  Why?  There's no reason to  I don't want to give you my reason  Wow this is a tough one  I really don't have much of an opinion on anybody  Club Soda Kenny can join the fund too 
[01:58:00]  Yeah?  Yeah you can vote  Well Kenny can vote  You gotta fold these up  It's a secret ballot right?  It's a secret ballot  Can I have your pen for a second there Jim Norton?  Thank you  I'll put mine in the box  No I was wondering if I can borrow your pen  You have to tape the top of the box  They're all gonna fall at the top of the box  Here  Tape the fucking box  Is it a secret ballot?  Or you have to put your name on it?  No secret ballot  Well I mean  You can have your name on it  Nothing says that you can't 
[01:58:30]  Like let the person know  No it's a big secret  Right  Where's Travis?  Someone get Travis  We're voting on asshole of the week  Travis what are you doing  Besides writing your own name in  Get in here  Hey Alan  Here you go  Rylan  Oh  Uh oh  Who's  Alan you gotta  Have in mind who you're  It's your bit  How could you not  Well for the longest time  It was Sal  But Sal and I are good now  Well Troy just came in  And said you don't shower  And you're lazy  Alright good point 
[01:59:00]  I hate to skew the voting  I told you he's not a bright guy  Oh my god  I can't really vote  I was only here for two days  Yeah but somebody was  Somebody's an asshole  I guess  Throw Iraq in or something  Yeah you're probably right  Yeah the Iraq's the go-to  If you don't have anyone  The Iraq's the go-to  If you don't have anyone else  Can you vote more than once?  Yeah but not for the purpose of this  I mean you know  Get my shit back Alan  Alright  Yeah sorry  What's up  Are all the votes in?  No I gotta vote for someone 
[01:59:30]  Alright  Ant's still writing  Oh Ant's writing  Ant's writing a lot  Oh boy  Oh no  What?  Just put it here  Alright  You wanna deposit  That in the receptacle  Hang on  Travis has not submitted yet  He was writing a lot  Yeah  And so then you've gotta  Pull him out  And start  And tally him up  Right right right  And we destroy all the ones that  No cause you gotta  I think you gotta read all the votes 
[02:00:00]  Should we just read all the votes?  You want me to help your  Your fucking bit?  Yeah you read them all  I mean hey  You're the talent  You're the one who  I'll help your bit  Okay  You have to read them all  But then whoever  Is the asshole  Travis fell  Now how your bit goes  Whoever's the asshole of the week  Has to read all the reasons why  Right?  Yeah  So someone has to read  The other reasons  For the ones that didn't make  Asshole of the week  That's true  And then you keep the ones  That are asshole of the week 
[02:00:30]  For the guy to read  Alright that makes sense  Do you understand?  So should we have the person who  Sam reads the ones that  Aren't officially the asshole of the week  Alright let me take these  And then  You know what I'm trying to say Sam?  Absolutely  I'll tally him up first  Cause your bit is  Where the asshole of the week  Has to read all the reasons  Why he's the asshole of the week  Right  Alright  Alright  So  Let me see  Here I'll mark it down for you  Okay we have  We have  So excited 
[02:01:00]  One  Two  Oh boy  Oh no  Okay  Okay  So far  Alan Thicke Jr.  Comes in with three  Sal has one  Sam has one  I'll make it four  For Alan Thicke  Four  One for Eric  Five  For Alan Thicke  Wow

[02:02:00]  Of the thing  So I have a pretty good idea  One for Troy  And  There's one for Lamar  Lamar  Put down there's one for Lamar  Who the hell is Lamar  Okay so  Lamar  Alright so  I'm gonna read  Here these are yours  Don't turn them over yet  Okay  And I will read to you  The reasons  The people who are not  Asshole of the week  Are assholes  Oh okay

[02:03:00]  Uh huh  Mars  The first part  Is crossed out  It is  Why  But it's a good clue  Cause it says  For talking in my fucking ear  But that's crossed out  And that part  Is crossed out  Really  Because this person  Thought of a better reason  Yeah  It actually says  For being Hispanic  Oh  See that's  Anybody wanna own up  Or  Oh  I was here  Before the show started  I think I  Figured that out  Awkward  He's looking right at me 
[02:03:30]  This one is not  Done by a creative person  It says  Sam  He is always  An asshole  Oh  It's not even a real  Who wants to own up to that  I signed everyone  That's yours Mars  Mars wrote it  I guess  Yeah  It's all the English he knows  Exactly  And the unasshole  Was spelled with an enya  Instead of an n  Oh yeah  Uh  Eric  Hello  Hi  Eric uh  Right  Bomb  I'm terrible

[02:05:00]  I wonder who  Uh  Anyone  Anyone  Anyone wanna  Own up to that  Anyone wanna fess up to that one  You gotta own up  Will that just stay anonymous  Or  Uh  Okay  Well  It's familiar  And it looks  Like something I would write  The most writing  Of course it's mine  I called in with the exact complaint  Keep that actually out  In case Sal wants to save it  All right  And this is uh  Lamar  Is the asshole 
[02:05:30]  And it says  Tuss  For fucking  My muttering  In the butt  I don't wanna call anybody out  I don't know  Who that was  Tuss  All right  All right  Now Alan  Has to read  All the people  That uh  All the reasons  That he's  Did he watch a skate  Eric got one  He got one  For uh  Vote  He said  Because he  Didn't ask Travis  Oh  But he pretty much skated

That's it  I don't know  I got a little ugly  With Nicole this week  She had a picture  With Selena  Oh, man  You worded it that way  Jesus, dude  And then it didn't help  When she was beyond pissed at us  And she was walking by  I asked her  If she calmed down yet  Yeah 
[02:29:00]  Even though we caused the drama  Yeah  Girls don't like hearing  Have you calmed down yet?  Are you thinking rationally?  So, believe it or not  I can't  I hope she understands  How rare it is  We basically don't apologize  For anything  Yeah  We decided as a show  Like, you know what?  Girls like flowers  Maybe we went too far  Let's get her some fucking flowers  Yeah  There she is  I didn't know she liked  Sour Patch  So you got some of that  And so she came in here  Still mad 
[02:29:30]  And we showed the flowers  Instantly  It was like  She's like, aw, that's so sweet  We erased her brain or something  It's amazing  It's amazing what flowers could do  Give her some of the old  Sweet talk  But the other thing going on here  Is the morning mashup  Which she obviously is the star of  Yes  The other guys get very jealous  Of the attention we give her  Oh, yeah  And the only reason we give her attention  Is because she's hot  Yeah, yeah, yeah  That's what it is  You know  It's like fucking  What is that? 
[02:30:00]  Gwen Stefani  And her band  No doubt  No doubt  It's like no doubt  You got the fucking chick  Yeah  In front  And oh, look  We're a band  We're a group  And everything  But everyone's just looking at Gwen  Right  And now you got fucking  You know  Morning mashup  And Nicole  Morning mashup star  Oh, God  Everyone looks at Nicole  I hope this shit works  Fuck  Wow  Anyway, so  She Instagrams the picture 
[02:30:30]  She tweets the picture  She's all excited  She's very happy  Blah, blah, blah  But because of the jealousy  Among the morning mashup  That she gets the attention  Did you see Stanley T tweeted?  What did he tweet?  He fucking  Oh, boy  He piggybacked  Nicole's tweet  And wrote  E-Rock backed  Really?  You just hear him in the distance  Really?  What the  You see this?

[02:31:00]  Thank you  OB Radio  Jim Norton  Anthony Cumia  Not Sam  Love you guys  And then with a picture  Of the flowers  Uh-huh  Our sorry present  And then  Stan retweeted it  And wrote  Thanks, gents  It's not for you  Yeah, that's really like creepy  Wait, wait, wait, wait  Wait, he takes the sour patches  For the whole show?  I could rationalize this  In his favor  I can too  Oh, oh  I see  She's in there  As I like to say  Cunt on wheels  Because of us 
[02:31:30]  Because of us  Right  We shook the bees up  In the jar  And opened the lid  That's funny  But by doing this  She's in a better mood now  We put the bees back in the jar  And they can continue doing a show  Without worrying about  Her attitude  Right?  I don't know  Maybe  No  You're not playing it that way?  We've got a split decision in this room  I think  Yeah?  I'm not sure  I was just offering up another  No, I like your  I absolutely like your thought 
[02:32:00]  But if there wasn't such  Incredible jealousy  Among those guys  There is, yeah  I think Stan is trying to  Glom onto it a little bit  Yeah?  That's what I think  Yeah  It's sad  He's trying to be like  Oh yeah, look  Opie Anthony apologized  To the morning mashup  Much like Virgil  Signing the million dollar belt  Exactly  And taking the pictures with E-Rox  Yeah  Stan is the Virgil  He thinks that we're  That's not a race thing  No  He thinks we're apologizing  To the whole morning mashup  You're right  Because we cause drama  Please  We cause drama with her  And we couldn't be less sorry 
[02:32:30]  About any way that  Stan, Rich, or Ryan feel  Oh, fuck no  Wait  Hopefully they feel bad  Hopefully  And I heard a name in there  Stan  Yeah, I know  Rich  Yep  Ryan  Huh?

[02:34:30]  Glomming on  Glomming on to this  It would seem like it  Is it for followers, you think?  Twitter followers?  I think it's just  Psychologically  He wants to think that like  Wow, one gesture to one member  Of the mashup  Is a gesture to all of us  We're all equal here  So, you know  Yeah, thank you  Nicole's right  And it's like  You have nothing to do with this, bro  Right  Yeah, bro  Dude bro

Did I hear  Jewdown  And I was like  No I said  Chewdown  And he actually said  Oh  He actually fessed up to it  A little bit later  But then he said like  Well I know what you meant  I said  No I was saying  Chewdown  And then basically said  I can't do an interview  Yeah  We were like  Fuck off  He was  When he was talking  About the copy  Being a play on the word 
[02:37:30]  Jewdown  He was probably right  But the problem  He was there  He took it out  And you guys  You're just doing a live read  So your issue  Is not with Opie and Anthony  For reading a copy  That a sponsor gives  If you have an issue  If you have an issue  If you have an issue  With the way it's written  If you think it was a word play  Maybe that was  But then we explained ourselves  But yeah that had nothing to do with you guys  Yeah we said look  We you know  Just reading it  Chew down  And chew down is like  You know  I've always said  It's like a beaver  Chews down a tree  Or something  You chew down  If you're going to say  Chew down  You say  Chew down  By the way  This place will just  Chew down your ambition 
[02:38:00]  Right  Exactly  Drive  But I understand  Because pretty much  Everyone does say  Chew down  Yeah  I don't think I say  I've always said  Chew down  But the common expression  To chew down  I never heard  Chew down  We got the call  You want to hear the call  Oh yeah yeah  Cool  You got it  You rock  Sure  Ben Stein  Hey Ben  Hi how are you  Hi how are you  Did I just hear you do an ad  Where you said  Somebody was going to  Chew down  The price of a car  No we said  Chew down  You just said  Chew down  Oh that's a lot different  We wouldn't say 
[02:38:30]  Chew down  On a commercial  We would say it  During the show  But not during  A paid advertisement  Ben  Okay  You being of  Jewish background  I would take it  Ben  Yeah of course  And if we were  Going to say  Something like that  We certainly  Wouldn't say it  Just before  We talked to  Ben Stein  Talked to Ben Stein  I see  You sure fooled me  Oh my god  Are we going to  Get off on a bad foot  With Ben Stein  Right from the start  Well I really think  That's a jackass  Thing to do  But we said  Chew down  Well it sounds  Just like 
[02:39:00]  Chew down  Oh my god  Well I mean  Come on  That's a crappy  Thing to do  That's just  An absolutely  Explicit invitation  To racism  Well it was  It's a term  That is used  Chew  Not Jew  I wouldn't have said  Jew down  Chew down  You know  You'd say like a beaver  Would go at a tree  He would chew down  The tree  Well it sounds  Just like  Jew down  And anybody  Listening to it  Is going to know  You're saying  Jew down 
[02:39:30]  With a tiny  Tiny  Change  In the accent  It sounds like  Chew down  Oh my god  Ben  Are you  Are you this insane  Are you actually  This insanely crazy  That you're arguing  Over chew  Or Jew down  Hello Ben  I think he just hung up  Ben Stein just hung up  That was funny  I thought he was  I actually thought  He was joking  A little bit at first  Yeah sure  Like just trying  To rib us  A little bit  But 
[02:40:00]  And then he was  Serious  That  Chew down  Well  Know what you meant  It sounds enough  Like it  Really  Meanwhile he didn't  How do you figure that  He did a show  Called  Win Ben Stein's  Money  Right  Which is a stereotype  That the Jewish people  Are frugal  You know  Win the moneylender's money  Yeah sure  And the money was nothing  It was very cheap  Shylock's money  The prize was very cheap  On that show  You know what this means  Ben  Not welcome  I'll cut your fucking 
[02:40:30]  Shylock nose off  And shove it up your ass  Not on my watch  Holy shit  What a great scene  We never heard from Ben  No that was it  Whatever  Anyway we got a restaurant  Racially insensitive  The owner of Patty Restaurant  In Hokeston  New Council County  Is working to salvage  Its reputation  As a wholesome  Family restaurant  I just do whatever  I can  I apologize  That's it  Owner Eve Teo  Is taking the heat  For racially charged  And insulting comments 
[02:41:00]  Posted online  By at least one  Of her workers  The postings  Turned up photos  Of bad tippers  And their receipts  Describing them  With the hashtags  Cheap  Pillbillies  And Jew  Jesus  That's an Asian broad too  Huh  Yeah  And people that work there  Was somebody that works there  Was posting pictures  That's good  Call them out  I agree  Fucking cheap motherfuckers  Whoever they are  They wrote hashtag Jew  Oh boy 
[02:41:30]  Yeah that's probably the problem  Yeah  Because probably they weren't Jewish  Who knows  You know  Teo says the online rants  Are not consistent  With their beliefs  And values  Yes it is  She says she's personally  Reached out to affected customers  Posted this apology letter  At the front of her restaurant  And is taking steps  To retrain workers  We had the consultant  Social manager  To take care of everything  For the future  It won't be happening again  The restaurant shut down  In the Instagram  And Facebook pages  Meantime  Customers say service 
[02:42:00]  Is normally good  And tips should reflect that  At least one worker  Who's been put on unpaid leave  Is learning tip means  To ensure proper service  Not to insult patrons  And that's such bullshit  To ensure proper service  No it doesn't  I love when people  Come up with acronyms  For things that  It's not true  For unlawful carnal knowledge  Right  Fuck man  For unlawful carnal knowledge  For entertaining  Under the consent of the king  Cop means constable on patrol  No it doesn't 
[02:42:30]  It doesn't  No nothing  Nothing ever means  The fucking dumb acronym  Stop it  Well  Yeah  Now Dr. Steve's saying  I gotta take a Zyrtec  Or a Claritin immediately  Zyrtec  I gotta fucking invest in that  They fix Zyrs  You guys have a broken Zyr  I have a broken Zyr  And he does Zyrtec  Who's got Claritin  Laying around this joint  Clara  You've got Claritin 
[02:43:00]  That's where she watches TV  In the den  Claritin  Claritin  Let's see  Huh?  Chucky wants in  He's mad  I think he's mad  What happened?  Chucky you mad?  Yeah I mean it would have worked  If you picked a call up  Two minutes ago  It would have been funnier  But basically  Next time you have a black guest in  Mentioned to him  That you're hoping  We don't trigger any controversy  Right because as Ben Stein said 
[02:43:30]  Well it's close enough  It's just enough  Close enough  That we know you meant  Jew down  Bueller  If you have an Italian guest on  Don't say hey  Let's start off from the top  Did you just say from the WAP?  I mean it could go all day  The Spanish guy  Hey go flick the light  Did you flick the light?  I mean come on  Can you have another example?  Yeah  Any more?  I don't have any ball  I'll hang up and wait for my beating 
[02:44:00]  Go  Alright Chucky  With that said  We got Brian Regan on the line  Oh  Hey  Brian  Hey  Brian Regan  How are you sir?  I'm doing great  How are you guys?  Good  Where are you right now?

[02:44:30]  That's a lot of dates there Brian  It really is  Well you know  Somebody's got to go out  And make these people laugh  Does it make people laugh?  Or is it still paying off the lawyers there Brian?  I guess it's a combination of that  He's like okay  I guess it's a combination of the two  Nah nah  I love  I love Brian Regan  We're huge  I would say anybody  Anybody from anywhere  That has Brian Regan  Within the blast radius 
[02:45:00]  Of an atomic bomb  You must go see him  You're playing in some cool places too  I see  You're going to go to Hawaii  Yeah man  I've never performed over in Hawaii  That's what I was going to ask you  That was the question  As the interviewer  Well  I'll let you ask  Have you ever been to Hawaii  Brian Regan  I have not  Wow  That's going to be exciting  I've been to Hawaii  But I've never performed  Oh well that's different  Because that's the whole thing  You've been there then  Like vacationing 
[02:45:30]  What not  Yeah  Yeah  Oh okay  I also have Alaska  On the  Wow really  So you're like  Doing all the states  In the union  I think  Once I do  Hawaii and Alaska  I will have performed  In every state  Every state  Wow that's pretty  God damn  Impressive  But I think  A lot of comedians  Have did that  Long before I ever did  Well probably  But they probably  Didn't satisfy every state  I'll tell you that much  But I know Brian Regan 
[02:46:00]  Very funny gentleman  When are you going to be  In Alaska  Because do you have to  Deal with that  All the time day  Or all the time night thing  Or you're going  To perform at dusk  I think I'm there  In August  Of the  Oh that's  That's daytime  2013  That's a lot of daytime  Yeah  They make it a point  To make it clear  To you  That it'll be  Chilly  You know  It'll be chilly  In the evening  But the audience  Will be coming  In flip flops  Ah yes 
[02:46:30]  They're used to it  Yeah  You got some  Alaska material  I mean  I don't have any yet  No  Topical  You're going to get  Topical for those people  It gives me six months  To write an hour  To come up with  To come up with  Regional material  You know it's funny  When that whole  Regional thing  Yeah  It's like  Sometimes you can  Fake it  And you don't even  You don't even know  What you're saying  You can go  What is the deal  With your highways  Everybody starts laughing 
[02:47:00]  And you think  I'm the only one  In this room  Who doesn't get  Doesn't get  The joke  And I'm telling it  Yeah  Are you almost  Finished with that  Construction  And then they laugh  For another five minutes  I was working  I did a college  One time  And before I  Went out on stage  This kid backstage  Said  Hey man  You might want  To talk about  How people  On campus  Like to drive  On the sidewalks  And I'm like  Oh okay  I didn't even know 
[02:47:30]  What he was talking about  But I get on stage  And I'm not doing  That well  And I figure  Well I might as well  Throw this arrow out  That the guy  Had given me  So I say  Boy you guys  Sure like to drive  On sidewalks  Huh  And the crowd  Just starts going nuts  And I'm thinking  I don't even know  What I just said  And I just kept  Adlibbing about it  I'm going  Yeah  Why drive on a street  When you can drive  On a sidewalk  Yo  I kept laughing  And I'm thinking  This is the most  Absurd comedy show  The only person  That doesn't get  Any of these jokes 
[02:48:00]  Is the comedian  The big yellow ones  Driving on the sidewalk  Just incorporate that  Into every one  Of your bits  Yeah  What's with these  Donut ladies  Driving on the sidewalk  To get to the donut shop  Wow  This is a hell of a  Tour man  How are you getting around  You got a bus  Or are you flying  Well I'm taking  The tour bus  To Hawaii  Oh the tour bus  To Hawaii 
[02:48:30]  Very good  No no  No I'll be  You know  Flying  And you know  I have a little  Information out there  For people who are  Boarding flights  Oh  Yeah this is just  Like a little  Like an FYI  You know  Just for people  Who are getting  On planes  With backpacks  You know  They have backpacks  Sure  And they're walking  Down the aisle  I just want them to know  Because they might not know  That their backpacks  Are hitting people  In the face  About time 
[02:49:00]  Someone said  Yeah they might not  Be aware of that  Right  I'm going to give them  The benefit of the doubt  But after going down the aisle  Looking for your 22D  The backpack behind you  Is hitting everybody  In the face  Yeah  Especially that little  Quarter turn  To look at the numbers  As you're walking by  Right  Yeah  You've got to do  A little quarter turn 
[02:49:30]  Yeah  You know what kills me  Is when somebody's boarding  And they look at  Every single row  They look at the number  At every row  You're behind the guy  Yeah  You can see his boarding pass  Says 32C  And he's looking up  Three  No  It's not three  Four  No  That doesn't seem  To be a match  You want to go  It's a numerical system  Yes 
[02:50:00]  Keep going  Of numerals  And they usually  Put them in a sequential order  Brian  You're a first class guy  Though right  You've got to be comfortable  With this many  Fucking flights  That you're taking  Well I  Yeah  I try to  I try to get up there  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  He doesn't like people  Knowing he's first class  No  You know what it is though  You've got to  Look  The guy's very funny  He's playing a lot of places  He's very humble  He doesn't want you saying that  You can't fly coach 
[02:50:30]  That many dates  Look at all the dates  But he wants people  To think he is flying coach  And the venues  Are paying anyway  We all know he's flying  First class  But he wants people  To think he's a regular guy  Flying coach  Yeah  I want to be of the people  That's right  Sometimes I can't even  Get a coach ticket  And I have to take  One of those train  Train things  Where you have to  Push the lever up and down  Oh that  Where you need the guy  On the other side  Also pumping the  The opening act  That's right 
[02:51:00]  Has anyone actually  Ridden those  In any point in history  That's just  What a fucking  A lot of work  To get somewhere  You might as well  Just walk  You know  It tells me  All those things  Like you see on  On movies  And you wonder  Did that ever really happen  You know  Like when the train  The train is leaving  And the people  Run along the side  Along the side  Of the train  And then they throw  That red kerchief thing  And then they hop on  And I go  Did that ever really happen 
[02:51:30]  No  No  Never in history  I don't think I would do that  That's all drama  I always look and go  I think I missed that train  I'm not  Run alongside it  Brian we  We recently played  Your bird bit  No  The golf  Yeah  Oh man  That thing makes us laugh  So far  I forgot why  And it was because  We were referencing something  Well someone was watching  Was it the Tiger Woods thing  Tiger Woods thing  And  Someone from home

[02:57:30]  Seeing him at Caroline's  Going out to the bar  At Caroline's  After the show  Drinking a lot  And then  They threw us out of Caroline's  So we went to another bar  Very nearby  Like across the street  And continued drinking there  And he got more  And more  Toxic  And nasty  You gotta think it's in him  And fucking  But funny  Like he wasn't nasty  To people  Right  He would just turn around  He'd look at someone  Turn around 
[02:58:00]  And he'd like  Look at them all mean  And kind of weave in a little  And then he'd turn and say  Yeah fucking piece of shit  Of him  I'm like  Fucking Brian's  Like  The consummate gentleman  And there he is  Saying some shit  That you know  Probably only heard  By me driving home  You know  He let it out that night  He certainly did  It was a  It was a pisser  Very funny  Man  Well  Jimmy's gonna be in Austin, Texas  I know  Austin, Texas 
[02:58:30]  Yeah  Leaving in a little while  Tomorrow night in Austin  And then May 10, 11th  In Wise Guys in Utah  May 16 and 18  Comedy Zone in Jacksonville  And I'm reading that  With the same fucking enthusiasm  The towns are showing  From me coming  Oh, Jimmy  And Thursday through Sunday  Stress Factory here  In New Jersey  Which should be very good  Memorial Day weekend  Very cool  I'm off the road for a while  For the summer, right?  To work on material 
[02:59:00]  Chill out a little bit  Yeah  Take a chill peel  I'm detecting a  I'm just depressed  I'm fucking  It just hit me  Really?  Why?  Yeah  No  Oh, no  You weren't depressed  When the show started  No, I just got annoyed  That thing?  Oh, the thing  The thing  Don Cheadle  I mean, I'm not annoyed  Don Cheadle  I love Cheadle  But I'm just bummed that  Don Cheadle's gonna be  In the building at 10  We could've done him  And we can't get him  I don't know why we can  I don't know either  And we would've stayed  Late for Don Cheadle  Certainly  It's not even 
[02:59:30]  It's not even a knock on him  It's just  And then  A friend of the show  Is just falling for  Some bullshit  Yeah, yeah  Some shenanigans  Going on here  At SiriusXM  Satellite Radio  With guests  And he hopes  We understand  And I think  I think it's  Safe to say  None of us understand  It's kind of fucked  You know  When you think about it  I mean  Obviously  Look, people know  I mean  We've said it a million times  And we do have proof  Howard Stern fucking cock blocks  People from our show  With guests 
[03:00:00]  But now it's like  You know  Friends of the show  Are falling for that shit  Apparently there's a moratorium  A two week moratorium  If he does  If a guest does Howard's show  The Stern show there  Says that  They can't do our show  Within two weeks  Even though we work  For the same company  Of his show  And even though  We've never done that  And we don't have any policy  We don't care  Who goes on  His show  Or our show  The same day  Who cares  There are certain guests  That go and do Howard  And then come over here  But I think they're really  Upper echelon guests 
[03:00:30]  That, you know  He can't tell them  What the fuck to do anyway  But  This guest, I guess  Isn't in that category  And was offered  To do the Stern show  I guess for the first time  He's very excited about it  So  He's blowing us off  He was already booked  To do this show  Wait, he was already booked  To do what?  To do this show  Was he?  I'm not really sure  I don't know  I think so  Oh, he was  He had to cancel  The booking because of it  He canceled us for this?  Yeah  Oh, fuck him  That's why it wasn't  It had nothing to do with 
[03:01:00]  I like the guy  But good luck to you, buddy  Good luck to you  That's bullshit  So he canceled  We don't play those fucking games  No, not Don Cheadle  You people don't listen  You people don't listen  Good luck to you, buddy  I think any comedian  Wow, that's  I didn't know that part  Of the fucking puzzle  Yeah, yeah  Because he was told  I heard it's a week  But it wouldn't have mattered  If he wasn't booked here  Because then the week  Wouldn't come into play  Right  But the fact  The only reason  Is because he was booked here  I didn't even know  He was booked  Yeah 
[03:01:30]  But the thing is  Like  To honor that request  That Stern shit  Still  All these years later  Still really  But Stern doesn't  Force them to do it  He just  That's what they say  And then people make  A choice to do it  Oh, no  It's a force  Because this particular person  If he doesn't agree to that  Will not be doing Stern  It's a very difficult situation  So he's being forced  To make a decision  No, no  But I'm saying  Oh, but you think  He should say  Fuck that then  I think anybody  I'm loyal  And I've been fiercely loyal  My whole career to people 
[03:02:00]  And it's just  Again, not, you know  To a point where I'm rather  Commit a career of suicide  But  People that do this show  Long term  And then do Howard  Not once  Amy Schumer called  Will those guys care  If I do Howard  We said no  No, no, no  That's what we were excited for  But anybody that would  Blow this show off  For Howard  Or honor that request  When they were doing this show  That literally is like  Seeing a girl for a while  And she says  Hey, this new guy  Is really attractive  And he wants to fuck me  So I'm not going to 
[03:02:30]  Go to dinner with you  Are you okay with that?  And  And you sit there  And go  Yeah, go to dinner with him  And they'll fuck you again  Yeah  It's ridiculous  It is  But they still play those games  We work for the same fucking company  It used to be one thing  When we were like  On different fucking  In different companies  Man, it's killing me  Yeah  And it bums me out so much  That comics would do that  Or anybody  Actors too  But it also makes me so angry  That one of the reasons 
[03:03:00]  Howard is such an obvious choice  For them  Is A  It's a bigger name  But the reality is  That looks like a fucking  It looks like  And fucking  FAA headquarters over there  Because he's smart  And he's got a TV stuff  And we can't even get shit  Streamed online here  And it's like  It makes me so fucking  Sick  To my stomach  The fucking sludge  Was he booked?  He was booked  Yeah, he  They pitched him to me  He didn't see that one  Yeah, he was pitched to me 
[03:03:30]  And  Pitched  Pitched  And they say  Hey, does this day work?  You was pitched?  Yeah, yeah  I'm pretty pitched myself  Right about now  I said  Monday works  After Bourdain  Cool, we'll confirm with you  And then  I got that email  Hey, man  I don't really care  But, you know  It's just  It's like  So, you know  You cancel us  We've been there 
[03:04:00]  For many, many years  Yeah  You know  Right from the beginning  This guy  Close to eight years  And we're not doing  We're not doing  The fucking  You can't do our show  It's not like O&H say that shit  I never have  No, because I said  Never  Not once  After he's done here  He can stop by here  Right  And then they're like  Well, he has an appointment  Right after  Yeah, see  That's why  That's why I asked him  Why can't you stop by  But then we got the real answer  In an email  The real answer  Which is how he says  How he says no  They're trying to do  The late night TV show rule  But we're not late night TV 
[03:04:30]  Right  Right  It's funny  We're not competitors  No  No  Yeah, and late night TV  Is one thing  Radio is another thing  And they know that  And they know that  And it's not  We're not competing  Like the late night rules  Are so you don't go  To your competition  Right  You know what I mean  Right  Right  Yeah, yeah  Like we're not competing  Whatever  But who would care  Because it's like  It doesn't matter  No, it doesn't  It doesn't matter at all  And again  I don't  Again  Stern can ask them  Whatever he wants 
[03:05:00]  He can say  Look, if you want to do my show  You have to pull your dick out  In the lobby  That's his right  To ask that  Their decision  Is do they honor it  Or do they not honor it  You know what I mean  And that  Is  It's always on the performer  Always  Because they say yes or no  You don't wear the publicist  That's too bad  He's going to learn  There'll be no fucking loyalty there  And then he'll be  Knocking on our door again 
[03:05:30]  Well  The thing with  That ain't happening this time  If you have a relationship  Like I don't fault Gilbert Godfrey  For not coming on this show  No, he's been a Howard guy  Since the fucking 80s  Or even Joan Rivers  Because she's been there  With Howard for many years  And she's showing loyalty  Yeah  And like, you know  But it's like  If it's people that we've had on  For a long, long time  Yeah  And they just blow the show off  Mm-hmm  Again, I don't  I don't think that  They're bad guys  And dicks  I just  I get it  Okay  But, you know  Across the board 
[03:06:00]  It doesn't matter if they're actors  Or comics or whatever  Mm-hmm  Yeah  Alright  We're so bummed  We should go home  I don't think you're that bummed  What?  Sam goes  I don't think you're that bummed  Well, we're bummed  You're not  We gotta get ourselves back together  I have to go play D&D  Yeah  Sounds fun  Why doesn't he just get laid  Saturday night  With fucking geeks like that  No, it's Saturday afternoon  It's afternoon  2 to 4  Yeah, you know at 4 o'clock  They don't break up  That's like the worst time 
[03:06:30]  They're just sitting there  Talking about how cool it was  That's prime time  Like, you know  Day stuff  Yeah  So much cool shit you could do  On a Saturday  Between 2 and 4  Exactly  D&D  D&D  Can we get the wall locked in?  Yeah, yeah  Oh, no, you can't  Hey, can we get some video on  Yeah, yeah  No, you can't  Gee, why doesn't people  Treat the show special?  I don't know  Because the company has you  In the same fucking size studio  As everybody else  Yeah  Maybe that's why  Maybe publicists shouldn't  Look at this show as special  And neither should performers  Because the fucking company  Just throws it into this 
[03:07:00]  Fucking cunt  Of a fucking studio  Maybe that's why  Well, uh  Well, uh  Well, uh  Oh, we might have a podcast soon  Oh, that's right  Oh, really?  We're still talking about that  Just fucking sludge  But you know what?  We do have the bus tour  That's coming soon  Late fall  Oh, boy  Late fall, right?  Get those calendars out  End of September  That bus is driving to your town  And we're going to the  Montreal Comedy Festival  Haven't heard about that  Since they suggested it  When's the festival? 
[03:07:30]  Are you booked up?  Oh  Oh, yeah  That book's early  Yeah, that hasn't come up  In our meeting  In the past  I literally cannot stomach  Anybody that works here  And I don't force me  In our circle  I can't stomach  The fucking lack of ability  To get shit done  It makes me physically fucking ill  Their lack of ability  Or willingness to get shit done  Yeah  Holy fucking shit 
[03:08:00]  The muck  But that's exactly why  Why should Cheadle do this show?  Why would he?  Look at it  Look at this fucking room we're in  We got a mailbox  On the fucking sofa  A box of mail  I asked for the studio  To be cleaned a long time ago  There's a lot of just chunking  Yeah  What?  Do you have a problem  With the mailbox?  It's just the point  That there's nothing  About this room  And there's nothing  We can do with it  That makes it look special 
[03:08:30]  Or like it's a place to be  That is like a fucking  An important place to be  Or a good place to be  You know  There's nothing in this  And there's nothing  With the way the company  Promotes the show  Or the way they treat the show  That says that  Nothing  I got a coat hanger  You asked things of the world  Got the lights  We finally got the lights  Zero  We look like clowns  Sitting in this fucking room  Honestly  I agree with it  Like fucking low rank  Fucking low rent  Faggot clowns 
[03:09:00]  We look like just sitting  In this fucking  Cock box  Hey can we get this done?  No sorry  I agree with you  All we wanted was the wall  To be knocked down  And the same dumb fucking faces  The same fucking shit  They say every time  It's always a lie  Or a well intentioned  A thing that's not even a lie  A thing they intend in the moment  And we all know  We'll get fucked up  All of us  Let's keep it positive  They're going to put a hashtag  On the pad data  That was a big discussion 
[03:09:30]  That was a two week discussion  That was a discussion?  Oh yeah yeah yeah  For a while  It started yesterday  What's to discuss?  Oh the hashtag started yesterday?  Yes  That's exciting  Gives a fuck  Who fucking cares?  A hashtag  It was a big deal man  When has Twitter been started  With hashtags  Two thousand fucking eight  Yeah  Seven  Cares  Care what the pad data says?  Can say cunt with a K  For all I care  That would be the best hashtag  For our show 
[03:10:00]  The pad data is more  Preaching to the choir  It is more people  Who are already listening to us  So I'm happy they listen  And we want it to be  Accurate information  But I don't care about that  Yeah  It means zero  For the fucking success  Of the show  They've uh  And it doesn't take much effort  They've replaced  The mic flags  In the other studio  Oh nice  So like there's  That studio's been spoken for  Yeah who had they put on it?  Entertainment  Weekly radio  There you go  Gets that whole spot  Sure 
[03:10:30]  That's exactly  That's the fucking priority here  Entertainment  But I suggested  Then move us over there  Because it's a bigger spot  At least let's  The entertainment weekly flags  Are on the mic  That's exactly  That's what this place is  It's just one  Long  Act  Of sludge  Thank fucking god  For Stan  Ugh  Yeah but me and aunt  Don't have anything  I know  Dude I honestly know that  This is it for all  It makes me  Sick  To my side  It's the only thing 
[03:11:00]  I feel like I can control  That just made me feel  Really bad for myself  It's the only thing I can control  I got an elevator show  The entertainment weekly  Don't give a fuck about  But that's what  That's what the company says  About the show  Yeah  The channel  We give you a bigger space  The channel  And get some cameras in  And make something out of this  And make it look good  What do they do  Over there?  It'll be shit  It'll be fucking shit  Fuck you  He is right  It's gonna be shit  And you know they didn't want  Do you know  John Cheadle is doing 
[03:11:30]  And this is not  He doesn't book his own schedule  He's doing Rotten Tomatoes Radio  And again  What?  He is just showing up  And going with it  There's a Rotten Tomatoes Radio  There's a Rotten Tomatoes Radio  Let me tell you something  Nobody fucking listens to it  I've never heard anyone say  Hey I like that Rotten Tomatoes Radio  Over there  Nobody  They probably talked about  20,000 people  Oh  You know entertainment  The entertainment channel  Our own  Entertainment Weekly  Entertainment Weekly  Our own Sam Roberts  Was up for the gig  To be a big host over there 
[03:12:00]  Right?  I was  The afternoon host  Whoa  And this is  And as much as  What I'm about to say  You can beat the shit out of him  But you know  Yeah  But it has to be said  In a real way  They really liked him  And wanted him over there  Whoa  But then the assholes  From what  Entertainment Weekly  I don't know  I didn't meet them  I don't know if they're assholes  They didn't like his voice  Didn't like your voice  They didn't like the sound  Of his voice  They liked what he said  They thought he was  More than ready  To take this gig on 
[03:12:30]  But then in the end  They didn't like his voice  I gotta agree with him  See that's where  I knew you would  Throw him under the bus  But the fact is  That's how ridiculous  This shit is  He's pizza  Opie  They're looking for  Pizza with a good voice  What's shallow  Motherfuckers man  Cock  That works properly  They want  They want this  Hey today  Right  We're gonna be talking about  Brad Pitt  And Angelina Jolie  But that's the shit  They still think about  Weese told me years ago  You don't have to have  A radio voice 
[03:13:00]  To do this  You know how great  It would have been though  If I was  If I had taken that studio  Damn righteous bucks  I would fucking hate you  You would have been  If I was doing the show  Wait Sam's got a show there  What  Yeah I said it  The other day  I can't even look  At the guys anymore  It's not even a joke anymore  I just pray  They're just  Realized they should  Just not  Even you know  Run into us  I feel exactly the same  And I like  Because I know  Because it gets to a point  You hear the same shit  Over and over  And over again  And we're talking about this 
[03:13:30]  And we're talking about that  And blah blah blah  Nothing changes  You know  We're doing our  Our  We're holding up  Our end of the bargain  I like them as people  But  Yeah they're nice  It is just one  Act of  It's just  The sludge drives you crazy man  It makes you fucking crazy  Yeah  It makes you fucking crazy  And  And it's just the easy shit  We want  Yeah  It's not even that crazy  Like what  Just the  We wanted a bigger space  Don't they own this floor 
[03:14:00]  They can't figure it out  They do  They own actually  This floor above it too  There's always problems  With the walls  This building money  That  This studio  This isn't a timeshare right  They actually own all the property  Yeah  So they could  They could finally listen to us  And go  Okay they obviously want  A better performance space  So let's do that for the guys  Whatever  There's a magazine  That's doing a radio channel  So  It will be fucking  It will be shit  Of course it will 
[03:14:30]  It's gonna be fucking garbage  Yeah we'll make their lives miserable  Really  Yeah absolutely  Who do we have to start beating the shit out of  Who's gonna do mornings over there  One of the editors of the magazine  Ugh  What does he know about radio  Fucking wow  What does he know about radio  He's got a good voice  Those niche  That's all they needed  It's gotta be  Those niche channels don't work  Everyone knows  They don't work  Of course not  You have to know how to 
[03:15:00]  Fuck  Take your niche  And encompass a larger audience  I guess  You know  That's entertainment tonight  Close enough  But not to be confused  But there's just  Look at this room  It's not even  No matter how neat we make it  Dude  This room  Well look around  Does not say anything  It's fucking special about being  What's wrong with this room  Look around a little bit  What's wrong with it  It's just small 
[03:15:30]  And shit  And like every other room  Even the console  Is like the worst color  Imaginable  Cause they got it cheap  You think there was a discount  On this counter  Oh so obvious  No one would have this counter  For anything  Even the two girls  One cup people  Fucking turn this counter down  They didn't want it  In their video  They were afraid  The shit would look bad  On top of them  It's the worst color  Imaginable  I don't even know  How to explain the color  We comfortably get  Videographers in here 
[03:16:00]  Huh  We comfortably get  Videographers in here  Oh yeah  They fucking stand  In the corner  Well then I can't move  For an hour  I had not allowed  To move for an hour  Because all sorts  Of cameras set up  Over here  Yeah yeah  And it's already  A tight spot  To get past Anthony  To begin with  I'm watching my weight  Okay  Oh my god  Hey guys  We're uh  You know  We're thinking about  There's a lot of thinking  There's a lot of nonsense  There's no one here 
[03:16:30]  That just takes action  What was the last  Good  What was the last thing  They did of significance  Because they  You know  Because now I got to hear  Oh you know  That just isn't fair  And then they list  A couple cute little things  They did for the show  But what was the  What was the last  Significant thing  They did for the channel  Or the show  The last major major change  That will have an impact  They canceled the bus tour  They uh  Hashtag  Had the hashtag  On the PBK  And the lights  I think the last one  Was the lights  Well we've had the lights  For a while now  Yeah  They threw some lights  Up on the ceiling  But they're actually  Paying guys  A lot of money 
[03:17:00]  To oversee this channel  The uh  You forgot about  The hashtag  Yeah the hashtag  Is gonna be alright  Yeah  You could see that  You know  Taking off  What's the hashtag  I don't even know  I just said  Yeah yeah yeah  Oh  I think it's our names  Or something  I heard hashtag  And it just made me sad  I heard that discussion  And I just felt sad  It was a whole discussion  They typed out  All sorts of stuff  To show us  What it would even look like  What  Yep  Why  We know what hashtags  Look like  We have Twitter  But there were different ways 
[03:17:30]  To do it  And do we do ONA  Do we do Opie and Anthony  Do we do Opie and that  Fucking weird  And sign  Ampersand  Yeah the ampersand  How do we do it  Do we just do Opie Anthony  What was the choice  I don't remember  What we chose  Y-Rock  What's the hashtag  Hashtag is Opie Anthony  Hashtag Opie Anthony  Nice  That's fine  Sounds good  Why didn't they put  The ampersand  Or ampersand  It breaks up  Hashtag  Oh right right right  Okay  Why is there a hashtag 
[03:18:00]  I would have went with  And  A-N-D  I would have gone with  O and A  So it would have fit  On the pad data  No I can't do that  Nah because people  Opie and Anthony  They know the name of  O and A  O and A  O and A is only  Opie Anthony is fine  O and A is the hardcores  They know us as O and A  But if you try and turn  Other people on  That are going through  The fucking dial of the channels  Then they see Opie and Anthony  They'll know what  Opie and Anthony is  As long as there's  P-I-E is lowercase  O is capital  And A is capital  Like you know  So it says Opie Anthony  When I hashtag 
[03:18:30]  I always use capital  And lowercase  Always  Always  With your first letter  Of the new word  You gotta capitalize  Oh no I do it  With the third letter in  Oh that's easier  Than to  The way Edgar talks  Alright Jimmy's gonna be  In Austin Texas  He's very excited  About the big gig  Tomorrow night  Ah fuck  And I guess  We're gonna go home  Happy birthday  To Anthony  Thank you  Wish him a happy birthday  On the Twitter today  Wonderful  Have a great weekend  Everybody  And now  The Opie and Anthony 
[03:19:00]  Show continues  This is  After O&A Live  Here's your host  Sam Roberts  You bet it is  After Opie and Anthony  Live and me  Sam Roberts  I like my voice  They almost made it  Management  Here at Sirius XM  Almost  Made it  The whole show  Giving flowers  To Nicole  Talking about  Ant's Backyard  Denim Styles  Brian Regan  On the phone 
[03:19:30]  Making intern  Alan Thicke Jr.  A bigger star  Than he already is  Management almost  Made it  That last 20 minutes  Sunk them  I don't even know  If it was 20 minutes  Sunk them  That's what happens  They probably would have  Been happier if  Opie and Anthony  Just went home  And E-Rock  Is in there  To be fair  I didn't even  Listen to the  Entire  Management segment  Because I started  Watching the E-Rock  Show at the end  Of the show 
[03:20:00]  You know I've told you  By the way  Call us up  866-WOW1-WOW  I've told you  That there's another  Show that goes on  While the show  Is happening  The E-Rock  Show is happening  In the room  Next door  And I saw  Right at the end  Of the show  You heard  You heard the  Sweeper  The closing sweeper  Just kind of  Spatter out  At the end  Of the show  And that was  Met with  Maybe  The weakest  Punch  Ever thrown  At machinery  I've ever seen  In my life  But E-Rock  Punched the  Computer monitor  He's so frustrated  In there 
[03:20:30]  Wasn't a strong  Punch  Like he wasn't  Punching it  Like with real  Anger  Like oh I'm  Gonna break  This fucking  Thing  But it was  Like he  Went back  I don't have a  Console in front  Of me  So it was  Hard to get  The full reach  But I think  Like halfway  Through the punch  You realize  I don't want to  Damage any property  And so like  You know  Slowed down  Your punch  Considerably  Maybe  Maybe a little bit  You're very frustrated  In there though  This place sucks  Whoa  Why do you say that  Because  We're one of the  Major shows here  Are you mad about 
[03:21:00]  The Entertainment  Weekly thing too  Yes  Extremely pissed off  About me not  Getting the show  Yes I wish  You were out of here  That's a good reason  Go on  No this place sucks  You were saying  It's just  And it's not even  The network  It's this one  Computer  No you said  This place sucks  It's the computer  You've mad at  Well hold on  So the computer  Sucks  There's no backup  For this  Right  Other than  You know  If I burnt CDs  Or had some other  Stuff in profit  Or whatever  But our  You know  Our entire catalog  Is in dilette  And when we don't  Have access to it 
[03:21:30]  For four hours  Right  That's a problem  But you know  I told people  And they were  Working on it  But nothing  Really happened  Today  I've just been  Kind of you know  Doing a crapshoot  Hoping that this  Thing works  So the problem  Is dilette  Is our main  Frame system  And that's where  E-Rock keeps all  His little hidden  Nuggets  All his little  Gems  All his little  Music  His little songs  His little bits  Everything  It's just all  Tucked away  In dilette  And he's got it  Set up all  And they're nice  All nice the way  He likes it 
[03:22:00]  Mashup Nicole is in  Here  Hi guys  She is smiling  Today  Yeah I feel happy  Today  E-Rock does not  Because his little  Treasure chest  Of audio  Did somebody mess  With it  And sometimes  When he's bored  In there  He'll just put  On an old  O&A bit  If he doesn't  Like what's  Going on today  On the O&A show  He's got his  Own little  He's got a  He's got a  Little section  He calls  Favorites  I go back  To the classics  Did Alan  Mess with it  Was it Alan  Whose fault  Is it now  That you're  Alan wasn't here  On time  To fuck with it  He hasn't had  A lot of time  To do much  So your little 
[03:22:30]  Treasure chest  Of audio gold  Was tampered with  Whose fault  Who needs to be  Fixing  It  I don't  Understand  Everyone in  Engineering should  Have been doing  Something about  This  And how many  People in  Engineering were  I don't know  I told who  Who needed to  Know  Who needed to  Know  Mars  You think  Mars was  Slacking off  A little bit  Today  No  Or as the  As his people  Would say  Siesta-ing  No  You don't  Think so  He was  You know  He was  Working with me  In the first  Hour of the  Show  Trying to  Get this  Up 
[03:23:00]  But then  Nothing was  Happening  I said  Can we get  Another computer  To replace  This  Oh there's  None here  We have to  Wait and order  Another one  There's nothing  I can switch  This out with  Chris is on  The phone  Chris is actually  A tech guy  Chris did you  Have a tip  Okay  Oh he just  Wanted to yell  Slob out  Okay  I didn't know  I didn't know  I'm sure  I had no idea  So you're  Mad at the  Whole company  Because of that  It makes your  Life difficult  It does  I'm not  He needs his  Nuggets  Not just my  Life difficult 
[03:23:30]  But we can't  Do most of  The show shit  I mean  Anthony is  Sitting here  He's doing  A Stephen  Singer read  He's talking  About Canada  Right  And E-Rock  Wants to pull  Out one of  His little  Nuggets  I think you  Just like to  Say nugget  And just add  In a little  Slice of radio  Gold by playing  The Canadian  National Anthem  Didn't happen  And guess where  He goes  Dude  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  And Anthony's  Like this  Now it's an  Interruption  Oh yeah  You know  Yeah 
[03:24:00]  Like this isn't  Highlighting what  I'm doing at all  And E-Rock  That's his whole  Shit  He likes to  Take what's  Going  He calls  What happens  In this studio  The cake  And then he  Goes  Let me add  The icing boys  Then some  Sprinkles  Yeah  Let me throw  A little  Let me throw  A little  Fondant  On there  You know  What I mean  Let me  Let me  Cake boss  This bad boy  Oh my god  You guys are  Really good  At this  Yeah  I'm loving this  That's what  Eric does  Not good enough  For Entertainment  Weekly  But  And what  Well yeah  No they  Talked about  That  No they  Said I was  Good enough 
[03:24:30]  They didn't  Like the sound  Of his voice  The guys who  Run the magazine  Didn't like  The sound  The magazine  Guys  I guess  They know  What's up  I think the sound  Of your voice  Is quite delightful  Actually  Soothing  Yeah it's very  Soothing  Well somebody  Could have  Just told him  He already  Is on the air  All the time  Like you know  What I mean  This hasn't  Well maybe  They know that  Maybe they just  Don't want your voice  Representing their  Company though  You think that's  What it was  Do you think  People listen to  Talk shows  For the sound  Of somebody's voice  Talk shows  No but I think 
[03:25:00]  If you tune  Into something  And like  Somebody's like  Nasally  And they have  A shitty accent  Or something  It's just  I mean  What is that  Who is that  Referring to  I'm just  I'm just  What does  Nasally  And a shitty  Accent mean  You know  I was told  I was almost  On Cosmo  With Taylor  Years ago  And they told  Me that I had  I sounded  Too New Yorkie  Whatever that  Yeah I understand  I mean I understand  That  It makes no  It makes no sense  I understand that  You're not  Nasally  It's like  And if somebody  Came on with  Like a  Like a  A little  No  Like a  Too  Like a  Too southerny 
[03:25:30]  Or had like  A weird  Twang to their voice  They wouldn't  Want that either  That works  That  Philosophy  Makes sense  In music radio  Because that's  When you listen  To the sound  Of somebody's voice  In talk radio  You get over  The sound of  Somebody's voice  Within ten minutes  Yeah but sometimes  People focus  In on it  And it just  Something bothers  Them about it  Yeah but that's  Any voice  There's no  Voice  So you need  You need like  A middle of the road  Like a Ryan Seacrest  Middle of the road  Ryan Seacrest  Doesn't do talk radio  That's not at all  What you need  For talk radio 
[03:26:00]  Just something  Easy to digest  Absolutely not  For talk radio  You need something  That's identifiable  That's got personality  To it  That's what you need  For talk radio  I'm sure you understand  That you have like  A very distinctive voice  And it could either be  They get your humor  And it's fine  With what goes along  With it  Or it's  It kind of is like  A little annoying  It's a love it or hate it  And they hate it  It creates an opinion  Right  Which is what you would want  For talk radio  No you want  Middle of the road  Not for talk radio  Absolutely not  Nobody listens to  Radio long form 
[03:26:30]  Do you think the people  That are running this channel  Know what's going on  With talk radio  No  You mean this channel  Or Entertainment Weekly  I'm talking Entertainment Weekly  Probably not  Like the people that are  Making the final decisions there  No  Because it's a brand  Apparently not  I would guess  Apparently not  Because guess what  I'm still in this  Fucking chair  Aren't I  You're so butthurt over it  Yeah a little bit butthurt  It's not that  I mean it's everything  You know  What else is bothering you Sam  That's the whole deal  What  It's not just a matter of  Of one place saying 
[03:27:00]  You know  You were great  But we don't like the sound  Of your voice  Because I don't care  That's fine  And it leads me to believe  That it probably wouldn't have been  The easiest work environment  Probably not  You know  If that decision is being made  This early on  It's like  Okay well maybe  There's some other things  We would have butted heads on  Something bigger and better  Is going to happen  I know  I feel it  See I've been hearing that a lot  Yeah  From who else  Everyone  But they don't do shit  You know  Nothing happens  The problem is  You're relying on other people  I'm not relying on anybody  You're relying on people here 
[03:27:30]  No  We've had this discussion before  If you're relying on these people  To take your career  To the next level  I'm not  You're going to be an old fucking man  I'm relying on people here  To give me a job here  I mean  I wouldn't even do that  With nobody else  You're going to give me a job here  Except for the people here  When does anybody  Are you saying  Do I do stuff outside of here  I'm saying  That's what  You should probably focus  Yes you do  But you should continue to  What's the question then  And I wouldn't worry about this shit  Because I don't need to fight  We're not fighting  You're both getting a little red  Listen flowers 
[03:28:00]  It wasn't too long ago  That you were in a bad mood  I was in a terrible mood  Foul  Foul mood  Foul  Okay  Tell each other you love each other  Well it's in a little  But sometimes I need to be the  Troy sometimes  He's a real piece of shit sometimes  That's what I think about Troy  Sometimes I just got to be  The reality check  Troy's a little full of himself sometimes  How's that full of himself?  A minute ago  He was telling the intern  That he doesn't shower enough  Troy's all about  Critiquing people today  Well  Hey  And maybe the intern  Did need a shower  But that's not for you  You're not the bathroom police  Nobody has a problem  Critiquing me 
[03:28:30]  That's true also  He did say you have  A queer cut's haircut  Yeah  That's fine  He said it was gay  I dig his haircut  Well you're a girl  At the end of the day  That's probably what matters the most  Yeah  That's true  You're sitting here  Not the intern  You're trying to impress  Good looking women  Instead of male interns  Of the Opie and Anthony show  We play Dungeons and Dragons  Is that what you're saying?  It's weird  He did say today  He plays Dungeons and Dragons  Well why would you admit that?  I don't know  Why would you do that?  I don't know  Because he's nervous  And just shit starts flying out  E-Rock  You doing any better in there?  Yeah I'm fine  He's not 
[03:29:00]  He sounds so defeated  We all got our issues  Alright  The fact that all you have to worry about  Is a fucking computer not working  You should be sitting there  With your feet up  And your head in the clouds  Like usual  I'm in a great mood today  You are why?  Why?  Why?  Well first of all  First of all  I'm DJing tonight at 675 Bar  And that's an awesome spot  In the West Village  Second of all  Opie just posted the elevator video  And that went pretty well  It came out very well  And it's nice  Opie's elevator video  He posted the link  You gotta go  To Opie's  It's on our Facebook too  Yeah but go to Opie's Twitter 
[03:29:30]  To see it  Because you gotta go through  E-Bomb's world  Because that's the way to do it  Yeah  But Opie Radio on Twitter  Is the link  And he did this video  Troy did the condom test  You know this is the YouTube phenomenon  What is the condom?  Oh wait  Is this when you  Like shove it up your nose  And try to get it out your mouth?  Very cool  Commendable  He attempted it  Had it work out  And we were  Great  He's successful  He did it?  Yeah  Oof  Well what he did was  He went home and he practiced  And he watched other YouTube videos  Just to get the technique  And that was a smart move  You didn't choke?  Oh yeah  Oh yeah 
[03:30:00]  Here's a  Oh and the smell and teeth of rubber  He's got his own little jingle going and everything  Wow  Yeah  You gotta go to Opie's Twitter  And you know  Going down with Opie  That's very sexual  That's not even the name of the show  It says going down  It's the elevator show right?  He wants to do the condom challenge  And Sam  You can see this video  He's not gonna be able to do it  Why is that?  Because it's too difficult to do  He's got a surgically enhanced nose  As it is  And he's generally not good at stuff  He's generally not good at stuff  I don't know if I can watch this 
[03:30:30]  I don't know if I can watch this  Oh god  Troy is sucking a condom up his nose  With the lube still on it by the way  Yeah  And now he's pinching it  Out of the back of his throat  I just  I just  Dry heaved  And spent  Nicole you've done a lot of stuff  Involving condoms  You've never done anything like that?  You've never had a condom  Like stuck in the back of your throat  Or anything like that  I guess you haven't used him that much  No  But I mean  If my mouth is there  There's no condom 
[03:31:00]  And then he starts whipping  Rolling with it for a while  Check it out  It's on E-Bombs World  It's on Obi's Twitter too  Disgusting  Yeah  I literally just felt  I was just gagging  Mongo  Is that Mongo  Yes  What's up buddy  Hey uh  I wouldn't worry about your voice  It's very sultry  The only thing that  The only thing that  Call it to Troy  The only voice on the channel  That drives me nuts  And I have to  Turn the volume in real quick  Is that  Fellas  From that stupid fucking 
[03:31:30]  The commercial  Oh my god  That stupid  Trying to sound sexy  But it really sounds like  Arnold Schwarzenegger voice  Fellas  Oh my god  It drives me up the wall  But you see  That's what I'm talking about  That's a 30 second piece  So that's something  Where the sound of the voice  Matters  Because  They're not  They don't have enough time  To actually do anything  That's compelling  Sam you have to admit  You have a little bit  Of an abrasive voice  It's polarizing  But it should be  It's talk radio  It's long form  It's like you're  People need to develop  An opinion 
[03:32:00]  But you're a little nasally  It's you know  And they goof  And you're like  Yeah  Yeah but that's a goof  Yeah but  It extends from somewhere  Yeah but I'm not sitting here  Going  I just got questions  Yeah you get an easy voice  That's what you sound like  Every day  Well it's fine  But  I was getting my hair done  I got a DJ  That's fine  That's maybe what I sound like  Yeah that's what you  But I'm not trying to get a job  Over there  Oh  Maybe you guys should arm wrestle  I can take you  I'm not even trying  I'm not going to arm wrestle  I beat him but I'm not going to do it  Oh  I think you should arm wrestle  I think that'd be great radio  That's why you're on the mashup 
[03:32:30]  And you only talk for two minutes at a time  On that note I gotta go  Why are you going?  Because I have a meeting with my boss  What are you going to meet about?  I was thinking you should play the hits tomorrow  Yeah okay we were going to do it anyway  Probably  But I have to  Did you like the flowers?  I really did  And really  I almost shed one  Good  Yeah  Good  That apology was really heartfelt  Makes you feel better today?  Yeah I didn't get to come back in  And see Jim Norton's junk  Even though my husband did allow me  So that would be okay  How much  Did you see that Stan tweeted  A thank you to Opie and Anthony as well? 
[03:33:00]  No I didn't  He tweeted  After you said you know thanks guys  Yeah  He retweeted it  And then wrote  Hey thanks fellas  Like as if to say like  Yeah from the morning mashup  Thank you  And we all were like Stan  Stan has nothing to do with you  Nothing to do with you  Oh  Stan's just trying  He's just  He was probably just trying to be protective of me  And just saying thanks for making our girl feel better maybe  Does he know that he had no influence over it?  Like it wasn't like  Oh we gotta make sure Stan's okay with it  I probably  I don't know  It's Stan  Stan says things that don't always make sense 
[03:33:30]  We were thinking that  By the way that's a  Seltzer water  With the flowers  So I should put some real water in soon  Yeah it's bubbly water  Because that's what I had  But yeah  Do the guys  Do they get a little jealous  That you get a little more attention?  I don't know  They don't say that  I don't think  We're not really a jealous crew  I don't think so  Yeah but I did hear them  Like no Nicole  You don't have time to go do their show today  We gotta do this  No because I can't  I mean I do have a job on the mashup  So I can't be on the Opie and Anthony show  When I'm supposed to be on the air on the mashup  That's not right  I guess 
[03:34:00]  Didn't people notice  Like you missed this one two minute little  Yes  Yeah I don't think anybody would notice  Nobody would be like  Oh Nicole's not there  Where is she right now?  Or would they notice  And maybe not so much  If one of the other guys was missing  Oh that's mean  Do you think?  I don't know  We want to all be there  We need to all be represented  And you know what?  I don't care if anybody else notices  My boss will get annoyed  He will  He'll be like  What are you doing on O&A  And not on the mashup?  And you're like  I thought the hits were playing  I thought the hits were still going  What do you have to do is say cross promoting  Because they love that here 
[03:34:30]  Be like  What are you doing on O&A?  Oh we're cross promoting  And they're like  Oh I want to hear Nicole  Talking about hits one on O&A  And she'd be like  Oh one time I took this dick  On the beach  This is not cross promotion  True story  I guarantee there's people  That have come over  That have started following her  On Twitter  Started following her on Instagram  Listening to the mashup  Dude she's got double  The Twitter followers  That anybody else  On that godforsaken show has  I crossed 40,000 yesterday  Even though I got so much hate  For looking so incredibly ugly  Next to Selena Gomez  I got 
[03:35:00]  I surpassed 40,000  Because of all that hate  That's the thing about this show  It's like  They'll give you like numbers  Yeah  It's not good numbers  For the most part though  No it's mean numbers  It's like really nasty people  I almost cried  There's some  Did you?  Almost  Then I was like  I can't do this anymore  I can handle a few jerks  But you know what  I'm a good person  And I don't need to feel like this  I hope people realize that  That they hurt your feelings  They actually hurt my feelings  People don't want to read that shit  On their phone  No  If you have nothing nice to say  Don't say anything at all 
[03:35:30]  That's right  That's what my mom taught me  That's the psychology of the after show too  Isn't that right piggy boy?  I'm just kidding  It's just  No because you said  If you don't get something right  I didn't mean that Eric  It was just  Situation  He's mad at the computer still  Is he still?  He's rubbing his head  Eric you're pissed in there?  He's not talking  He's so frustrated  Let him do his thing  Eric are you pissed at the computer or me?  I have nothing nice to say Sam  So he's not going to say anything at all  That's very good  That's very good  Alright well Nicole  I'll let you go to your meeting  I love you guys though 
[03:36:00]  You look very nice today Nicole  Thank you so much  You're very welcome  Troy you look super sexy  And I'm going to be down in the village tonight  So maybe I'll stop by  I would love that  Hey  Is your boss going to be like  We're thinking maybe we'll play Bruno Mars  Seven times an hour instead of six  Oh good  I'll let you know  Is your husband going to be with you in the  Yes you will  Oh sorry about that buddy  No he's cool  I know but I know  You're more you know  You're not like the  Let's hang out with you and your husband type  A little better with one on one  Yeah you're more of a  Let's get some one on one time  Let's get some QT going on  He's a cool dude  I know I hang out with him 
[03:36:30]  I know  See you later Nicole  Bye guys  Are you making fun of my voice?  No no no  I took that as an insult  Well you're the one who said  Nasally and shitty accent earlier  Well I mean  You know  Well I mean  You gotta know who you are  Well you gotta know who you are  And you're a piece of garbage  I'm not looking for a job over at  Entertainment  Well I think you're also  You look dumb to be a DJ  Well  That's my opinion too  That's fine  And we're all entitled to our opinions aren't we  Opinions are like assholes  I'm sitting across from one  But I have the job  You don't  Well I don't want that job 
[03:37:00]  Okay  Oh yeah you do  I did  Not anymore  It was just an odd job  You're so butthurt  I'm a generally butthurt guy  You know  It's so funny  Because what I meant  You were such a fun  Have fun kind of guy  I mean to be fair  So were you  Well  You got your share of butthurtedness in you  We're talking about me right now  But you got your share  You turned into a bit of a butthurted person yourself  Yeah  Well  You know  Sometimes the  I mean  The morale goes kind of low around here  Don't act like it's a mystery  You know  Marshall in Texas 
[03:37:30]  Yo  Sammy Pesos  What's up buddy  Hey man  Yeah you know what  This has just been ridiculous  It's so frustrating to watch this go down  As a fan  Just ever since they had to move over to that building  It's been a fucking disaster  And I feel like they should just filibuster from here on out  Every day  All day  Bitch about management  Talk about their personal lives  Talk about their appearance  Get people to fucking tweet them and shit  Until they get fired or something gets changed man 
[03:38:00]  Yeah I mean  You know  They're also making a lot of money to do a radio show  So I don't know if they want to sit here  And get themselves fired  Because  You know  I'd be fun to  It'd be fun  Trust me Marshall  I'm like you  In the sense that you and I  Just want to watch the world crumble in front of us  Like it'd be fun  It'd be fun to see it happen  But you know  Yeah but I mean  Set in a blaze  Yeah yeah  I mean it'd be great  It'd be great  But  Sammy  Yeah  Would you guys like 
[03:38:30]  If they did a podcast  Would they really have to drastically cut staff  Or  Because that might work  If they did a podcast  They'd probably just figure out how to do it themselves  And realize they never needed a staff to begin with  Oh shit that would ruin it  Alright man  Alright buddy I'll talk to you later  Yeah I mean there's lots of things they could do  But at the end of the day  They enjoy doing radio  I think so  I mean they hide it pretty well  But at the end of the day  They do enjoy this thing  Well they do it well  They know what they're doing  Behind a fucking microphone  For God's sake  I mean there's very few shows 
[03:39:00]  That are on the level of this show  Maybe none  Name two  Yeah  You can't  Yeah  By the way  Based on the conversation  That ended today's  Opie and Anthony show  I don't think I want Nicole  On Howard Stern's after show  I think I'm going to put that down  Does she go on there?  No  I just want to make the rule now  Because did you  Did you hear what they were talking about  At the end of the show?  Yeah yeah yeah  That some guest  I don't know who it was  Some friend of the show  Is not going to be doing this show  Because apparently 
[03:39:30]  There's a rule over there  So I feel like we should be  Making the rules too  You know?  I'd like to see them  Follow through with this rule  No I don't think  I don't think it would happen  I don't think I'd have as much  Power of enforcement  As they do over there  What's up Mike?  Hey Sam  How are you?  Is SiriusXM dumb?  Do they not understand  The amount of crossover audience  You would get  If you were on  That Entertainment Weekly show?  Look I don't know  I don't know  Who  At this point 
[03:40:00]  I don't know  Who to make the argument to  I don't know  If anybody would  Would even hear it  You know what I mean?  Now can you confirm or deny  The best celebrity  Is Marc Maron?  I can't confirm or deny it  Okay  That's all I want to know  Twitter's a buzz  Okay  Okay  I can't  I can't confirm or deny it  I appreciate it  Alright buddy  Talk to you later  Mike in Connecticut  Sam Roberts  Professional broadcaster  How are you buddy?  Don't let Entertainment Weekly  Get you down  Because it doesn't matter 
[03:40:30]  What they think  Millions  And millions  Of ONA  After Show listeners  Love your voice  And want to tussle  Your hair  Punching out  You hear that Troy?  Yeah  How's that for a shitty voice?  Hey  They want to tussle my hair  And my hair isn't  The easiest tussle  You can see my hair  In the Opie Elevator show  That's on his Twitter  Okay  That's not the type of hair  You could tussle that easily  It's very coarse  Thick  I don't have a problem  With your voice  Well you made it seem like that  No I'm just trying to  Trying to help you understand 
[03:41:00]  Maybe where they're coming from  That's all  Coke Logic has an idea  And Coke Logic  Is one of the greatest  Creative minds  In the Opie and Anthony  Listener community  What's up Coke Logic?  Oh thank you sir  Yeah I think for that  Demographic over at EW  You probably should have  Auditioned as A.J. Poopy Shit  Maybe that would have been  The trick  If I brought out  The A.J. Poopy Shit's  Character one last time  And see if they wanted  To do A.J. in the afternoons  No  What's up y'all  That would be so funny  If I had gone into 
[03:41:30]  The audition  Doing the A.J. Poopy Shit's  Character  Oh Mars is in there  E-Rock  How's Mars doing in there?  Alright  He just came in here  To look at someone  Is he  We're looking at the light?  Yeah  You're down about this  You are pissed off  About your computer  It just sucks  It's been a bad day  Across the board  You're like a chef  Without the ingredients  I mean I'm having a fine day  No you seem pissed too  Well you brought up  Something you know  I didn't bring that up  It was brought up  I'll say  That you weren't hired  At Entertainment Weekly  No I know that  That was something 
[03:42:00]  We were talking about  I'm in a great mood  Why is that?  Today's just a good day  Is it because Alan Thicke  Made a celebrity of himself?  Yeah  Alan Thicke Jr.  Is it because you got to  Shit on him a little bit?  I didn't really shit on him  You told him he smelled like shit  Well  You told him his hair was greasy  And looks like he hasn't  Showered in 8 months  I also told him he shouldn't  Be sleeping out there  I'm trying to help the kid out  Like how is anybody  Going to take that kid seriously  With him sleeping  And looking like shit?  Do you think he looks like shit?  Well I mean he could use a shower  Chad in Wisconsin 
[03:42:30]  What's up Chad?  Nothing?

You got your bit on the air?  I got my bit on the air  And I want you to know something  You painted a picture of me  Today on the  Opie and Anthony show  That I feel like  Is a little unfair  Okay  You know  You said that I had been  Like I had been  Deliberately  Not allowing you  To pitch your bit  On the after show  Where you wanted to 
[03:45:00]  Since February of this year  Correct  So that's about three months  Yeah  Stuff just got  Kind of  You know  Going on the show  And that's all it was  You got to understand  I mean there were  I wouldn't believe that  There were a few Mondays  Where I wanted to go to it  And you weren't here  So it's like  What can I do  You remember this Monday  Troy you're a fan  Of the after show right?  Yeah  This Monday was a little slow  As far as after shows go  Yeah  I don't do Mondays though  I'm not here on Mondays  I could have used the  Asshole box on Monday  Well I mean  That's 
[03:45:30]  I mean what about  All the other days  Where you said  You're going to do it  Well there's been times  That Who Kid just shows up  And brings a bunch of people  And it's out of our hands  We don't know  And it's like  When Who Kid shows up  He brings just  This whole  He brings a bundle  Of entertainment with him  The way Eric has a computer  Full of nuggets in there  Who Kid brings a bundle  Of entertainment  Wherever he goes  But that doesn't  Explain the days  Where we have nothing  Where we don't have any guests  Who Kid's not here  Right  And you do promise me  Or you have promised me  That I'd be able to  Get my stuff on the air 
[03:46:00]  Well then you end up  Being interesting  And you talk about  You know  Fucking your ex-girlfriend  And Troy wants to fuck her  Or you talk about  You know  Or there's a problem  With the phone screener  That's just  So compelling  That I lose track of time  Well I have an update  On the whole  Girlfriend situation  That's what I'm talking about  That was a great story  Because you came on  This was a couple weeks ago  And this was the same day  That you said  That you went home  And masturbated to Nicole  From the morning mashup  Correct  You said that you  Never had a lot of luck  With women  No 
[03:46:30]  And that you had  You've only been with one person  Or have you been with  Other people since then  Sexually I mean  I've been with other people  You have  How many  How many have you dipped in  And I don't mean  I don't mean a blowy  Alan  As the kids call it now  I don't mean a blowy  I mean full intercourse  How many are we talking  Between you and  Seven  What  Seven  Where'd the other six come from  Well that was before  I dated my girlfriend  So I lost my virginity to her  And then we dated  Like after I had sex  With six other women 
[03:47:00]  Oh so when you banged her out  You weren't dating her  No  You dog  And then you were like  Let me get some practice  Right  Now when you were banging  The other six  Were they white women  I think two were Mexican  Look at you  Trail mix of broads  Just a mixed batch  Ready to go  Wayne in Georgia  Hey buddy  What's up buddy  No I was wanting to say  Like I know you get a lot of shit  For your voice  And to be honest with you  I live in Georgia  And I'm around 
[03:47:30]  Southern people all the time  And when I first started  Listening to the show  I did find your voice  Just utterly enraging  But now I've come to  Well not appreciate it  But it's not  It's bearable  I mean it's not  Unbearable like it used to be  That's what happens  In talk radio  Even if you hate  The voice at first  You're like  I'm gonna give it a chance  Oh I kind of thought  What he said was interesting there  Let me grab the audience  Okay  So when they have a ton  Of voices in front of them  And you're one of them  And they're only hearing you  For the first time  They don't know your personality  They don't know  Who you know  My personality  Because it was a 
[03:48:00]  40 minute demo  Well then you have  Other people in front of you  But they're just hearing you  They don't know you for years  You know what I mean  There's fans of yours here  That have been listening to you  For years  They specifically said  That the demo  That was cut  The material on it  Yeah  Was better than the other ones  Well good  But  Not good enough  The voice is obviously  Important to them  Roland  I have three Blu-rays  Of the Sandlock giveaway  Oh I would have given  That guy one  Okay it's good to know  It's a 20th anniversary  That's good to know  Alan  Yeah  You smell dude  Fuck dude 
[03:48:30]  Does he really smell Roland  He does  I can smell it  I can't smell it  From back here  But you're a lot closer  You know I can smell it  Because I'm used to  Cleanliness  And that's  Because Roland  Roland is known  For being clean  Roland  Very clean  I've never smelled  Roland  Smell bad  And Roland's a bigger guy  Roland's like a fat guy  No offense  This is not  A little offense taken  A little offense taken  But go ahead  He likes a dessert or two  But  Usually bigger guys smell  That's the thing  Eric  Usually bigger guys smell 
[03:49:00]  A little bit  I'm kidding  I'm kidding  I'm kidding  You know what  You don't smell  I can give you  Your point on  Right  I'm kidding Eric  I just made it hurt  Because Troy was getting me upset  Do you accept my apology  No  Fuck you  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  What are you laughing at  Ouch  Nothing  Right  Okay  So  Roland always makes sure  He smells good though  He never smells bad  He mixes  Different soaps together  To create the laundry detergent  That he wants  Isn't that true  Yes  I spend a lot of money  On special soaps  I order online 
[03:49:30]  Right  So he knows  And he's a foodie  And foodies  Appreciate the way  Food hits all senses  Yes  So you know  That food hits you first  Where does it hit you first  The nose  Right  The aroma  So he knows smells  First the eyes too  And what are you saying  As far as Alan's smell  If I was a foodie  He would have been  A side of shit  Okay  A side of shit  That doesn't make you  I mean that just  You're just saying  He smells like shit  The look is not appealing  I'm sorry 
[03:50:00]  I mean Alan  That's not what today  Was supposed to be about  It's alright  But today he'll come back  Shower and come back  It's going to be like  Back by brand new  You think so?  Yeah  Brand new is what  Roland said  Brand new  How do you think  Today went  Alan?  I think it went well  Yeah  Yeah I mean  It's kind of weird  I've been in kind of  A bummed out mood all day  I kind of feel better now  You do?  Yeah I do  Because Alan finally  Got to pitch his bit  Which was the  Asshole box  Right  Where every week  People get to 
[03:50:30]  Blindly  People vote  On a secret ballot  For who was the  Biggest asshole of the week  And then you count them out  And then whoever wins  Has to read  The reasons out loud  Right  Why they're an asshole  I wasn't expecting you to be  Necessarily happy  Because  By a huge margin  You won this week's  Asshole of the week  Right  I mean did you expect that?  Well partly  Because I thought  It'd be  Kind of funny  If my own snake  Bit me in the ass  Okay I don't know  If that's the phrase 
[03:51:00]  But go on  Is that like your dick?  I guess  Right  If you  Fucked yourself?  I'm really bad  With these colloquialisms  Yeah I don't even know  If you pronounced that word  Correctly  But go ahead  Yeah I mean I don't know  It didn't bother me  Because theologist said  I smelled  Which I thought  Well some of them said  That you wasted the show's time  And some of them said  That you sleep a lot  That is true  Yeah and those are all  Valid complaints  And you can't find  What we need you to do  As an intern 
[03:51:30]  Now do you feel today  Like you  They were a little harsh on you  That you're kind of  It just kind of  Made you feel bad  Or do you feel like  Today was constructive  And you're going to  Come off this  And do a better job  Because I mean  That can go both ways  It's a delicate thing  Because when you point out  Somebody's flaws  Especially Troy  Is the type  That just blatantly  Points out  What he sees  As your flaws  And in his mind  He's doing it to help you  And he does this  With everybody  A little earlier today  He said to somebody 
[03:52:00]  Who was in a very sensitive  Vulnerable spot  That they had a shitty accent  And a nasally voice  And it really hurt them  Wow  You know  But that's neither here nor there  So Troy tends to be  Very blatant  About the way he says things  And that can either  Be helpful  And you can say  Okay now I know  Directly what I need to fix  Or  It can just make you  Feel bad about it  Like when you put  That kind of advice  To most women  Women will respond negatively  And say  You know  Most women right 
[03:52:30]  They'll say  You know  They won't like  How harsh you are  They like to be  Kind of  They like to be  Listened to  But sometimes  It's something  They need to know  But sometimes  They don't take  The information in that way  That's what I'm saying  All I'm saying is  Look I like Alan  He knows it  Yeah  And I feel like I've  I try to  Did my best to help you out  As much as I can  I've had you sit in with me  I've helped  I said  Hey  You know  He was saying something  A project that is  School or work  I said bring in the session  Let's take a look at it  I'll help you  Do what you need to do  Have I not  Yeah you did  I mean  You've been watching my back  Here's the question  But I'm going to tell you
