<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of Heavy D's death, speculating on the cause and the intern Sam's limited familiarity with his music.  This transitioned into a sarcastic commentary on Eminem's infrequent appearances on their show, contrasted with their own work ethic.  The hosts, along with Ron, Tom Papa, and Andy Dick (who arrived extremely late and was ultimately cancelled), and Jimmy, also discussed the upcoming emergency broadcast system test, joking about exploiting it for profit and committing crimes during the silent period.  The Occupy Wall Street movement, particularly the "mini-Woodstock" event with David Crosby and Graham Nash, was criticized for its perceived hypocrisy.  Brett Ratner's resignation from the Oscars was also covered.  Phoebe Wiebelstein, a dog, was present in the studio.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a visceral and explicitly vulgar discussion of a podcast featuring Bailey J., a transgender performer, focusing on their gender identity, physical attributes, and sexual experiences. The Penn State child sex abuse scandal, involving Jerry Sandusky and Joe Paterno, dominated much of the broadcast, provoking outrage and generating numerous calls from listeners with varying opinions. The hosts played a video of Paterno addressing supporters, critiquing his response.  They also shared their own negative experiences with social media, particularly Twitter, regarding the scandal. Tom Papa discussed his upcoming stand-up shows, and Opie recounted his frustrating experience playing *Call of Duty*, a theme which continued with Tom Papa detailing his own inept gameplay and humorous anecdotes involving accidental grenade damage and poor navigation.  Papa also recalled a *Half-Life* exploit involving pornography.  A caller shared his own poor gaming performance, attributing it to his wife's unusual fighting style and his alcohol consumption while playing.

A humorous and escalating rivalry concerning the baking skills of Paul's mother and Sam's mother formed a recurring segment, involving vulgar jokes and comparisons of their cheesecakes, pumpkin pies, and key lime bars.  Mad Dog Chris Russo briefly called in to offer his opinion.  Sam's mother's (Bobby) Viking oven, Tupperware, and even a preserved afro from Sam's college years were discussed.  The hosts' frustrations with Andy Dick's extreme lateness were a recurring theme, punctuated by updates on his whereabouts.  The messy studio bathroom also provided comedic fodder.

Another segment delved into the hosts' past judgment of a guest based on reputation, contrasting it with their negative experience with Paris Hilton.  They debated whether passive aggression was worse than direct confrontation.  A voicemail from Roland, reacting to the criticism of his mother's key lime pies, showcased his rambling speech pattern.  A discussion on video game addiction and its effect on relationships followed, with Jim and Eric sharing their experiences.  A call from "Chip Chipperson," known for his crude humor, led to Nicole leaving the studio following his interaction with her.  Finally, Andy Dick's belated arrival allowed him to discuss the online reaction to his impending appearance and clarify his lateness, promoting his movie *Division 3* in the process.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The European Central Bank left the referent.  I hope you get all in my mind.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel.  XM 105, Sirius 206.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What planet are we living on?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up. 
[00:00:30]  And Anthony.  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R-opening, it sounds like a little...  Fuck.  E-j-dang open-hand, don't listen to a-dang open-hand.  Stop.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, I didn't realize. 
[00:01:00]  Oh.  Tom Papa's in today.  Good morning.  Oh, good morning.  Good morning.  And Andy Dick.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And Ron.  There we go.  That wasn't my approval.  Why are we taking it?  I don't know.  All right, don't you tell me.  Let's cancel.  What?  What?  I don't like Andy Dick.  He's a dick.  What's he in for, 20 minutes?  Yeah, well...  Yeah, who cares?  He acts up, though.  There will be a problem.  We'll gap with him.  See what he's all about. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  But Tom Papa, very excited about that.  Tom Papa.  Papa!  No one freak out.  There's a fucking nationwide emergency broadcast test today at 2, by the way.  Is SiriusXM involved in this?  Uh, the engineer should know.  Yeah.  Morris, could you find one?  So why are we here?  You're not one.  Damn, that's a good engineer.  Why are we here, then?  Uh, well, it's only...  Why are we broadcasting if there's an emergency thing happening today?  It's for 30 seconds. 
[00:02:00]  Well...  At 2 o'clock.  Well, I think we should leave and allow them to prepare for that.  Yeah?  Yes.  You think that we need preparation?  I think so.  It's every single broadcast facility in the whole country.  TV, cable, broadcast radio, satellite radio, is all going to be for 30 seconds.  And they're so afraid of the 911 lines being tied up, because people are dummies!  They just don't understand, like, when a test is a test.  And it says, you know, this is a test of the emergency broadcast system. 
[00:02:30]  But it's the first nationwide one that's being done.  As soon as that happens on your TV, I always run to my phone.  Do you?  Yeah, because...  No, 911!  Yeah, because that noise is just so foreign to me.  I have to run to my phone to call somebody.  We used to get that boop, but now we got that boop.  Or the modem sound.  No, I get boop still.  I get the boop.  No, you get the modem sound.  Oh, I get the...  Yeah, it's like...  It's like information being sent over.  It's kind of in between a modem and an alarm clock.  Yeah.  An old school alarm clock.  Exactly. 
[00:03:00]  So why?  Is there a meteor or something that's getting a little close to Earth?  No, they just figure with, you know, the technology we have today,  there should be something that instead of just locally having these emergency broadcast  things, that the president, the White House, Washington, should have access to the entire  nation in case of emergency.  They could hit a button and pretty much tell everyone that the shit is hitting the fan.  So how do we tap into that to get some promotion?  Yeah, how do we capitalize on that?  That would be huge numbers for us. 
[00:03:30]  Where we broadcast over this emergency broadcast system?  Well, there's got to be one guy.  They should sell it.  For 30 seconds, you get to talk to the entire nation on TV, radio, satellite.  That could...  30 seconds!  That could solve the debt problem.  That would rule.  I bet you there's a guy out there that would go, fuck yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I got a bill.  Anything you want.  A billion?  30 seconds of just fucking grabbing a girl by the hair and having to suck your dick.  Whatever you want to do, man.  Whatever you want to do. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, there you go.  That'd work.  You sell that shit, and when you get some takers, you give them the mic for 30 seconds  on every single TV and radio.  30 seconds and go.  Yeah, that's good.  And own a logo over the broadcast.  You could just sell logo space.  Yep.  On there.  It's not a bad idea.  Oh, why not?  I know we're having fun with it, but damn, that's a good idea.  So what is that?  Two o'clock?  Two o'clock, I guess, Eastern Time, since it is national, I would guess it would be.  So two o'clock's a good time to commit a crime. 
[00:04:30]  Hey!  Good idea.  No, I'm serious.  That way, 911, it'd be like, hey, I'm calling 911 because we know!  Right.  Click.  Right.  I was like, no, there's a crime going on.  Yeah, I think that's a good time for that shit.  There's something going down.  I always know when it's a good time to commit a crime.  Commit a crime.  I always knew that because I wanted that.  Well, don't do it if you can't do the time.  Oh, true.  Don't do it.  I always wanted that in my back pocket just in case I needed to go there.  The famous one was when I was living in Buffalo.  I've said this a million times, but when the Bills play, that's the perfect time to rob houses. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  Because you just drive in these neighborhoods and you see everyone leaving with all their Bills stuff on and coolers.  It's so obvious they're either going to the game or going to someone else's house for the game.  They're destitute.  What are you going to get, though?  Nah.  Not if you go up to...  You want me to go local?  You go up to Amherst.  Yeah?  You're going to get some fucking nice things.  Yeah, you're going to get some shit?  You're going to get some nice things.  Yes.  30-second crime spree, though.  Huh?  30-second crime spree?  What do you mean?  I'd be like, well, for the 30 seconds that the emergency broadcasting is going, you'd have to get the stopwatch. 
[00:05:30]  And...  10 seconds!  Go!  That's two rapes.  That's two rapes.  That's two rapes.  Jesus.  Yeah.  So that's going on at 2?  Yeah, 2 o'clock, so don't freak out, okay?  All right.  Well, everyone's going to freak out anyway.  Everybody just hold on to your fucking cocks.  Don't worry about it.  Dude, we got...  You're a big cock if you're mad.  We got Woodstock happening at Occupy Wall Street. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, really?  Is that Woodstock?  Look.  Woodstock-otty.  Oh, come on.  The worst headline ever.  They didn't even try.  They didn't even try.  It's Woodstock-otty.  Playing off Zuccott-y.  It's Zuccott-y Park.  It should be...  My pal, Stunt Brain.  Zuccott-y Stock would have been better.  I don't think we line up correctly politically, but I like the Stunt Brain.  And he called me yesterday.  He goes, hey, you want to go down to Zuccott-y Park?  You got David Crosby and Graham Nash.  They're going to be performing. 
[00:06:30]  Wow.  And I couldn't get out of the house yesterday, unfortunately.  When is Sean Anna showing up?  So he went down there, and then he wrote me, and he said it was the lamest thing ever.  There were so many people there to hear Nash and Crosby.  Hey, get off those towers.  I'm warning you.  That was a great Woodstock fit.  Billy West.  Where was the Stills guy?  Stills is...  Isn't it always Crosby, Stills, and Nash?  You can't go Crosby, Nash.  That's too weird.  Well, Stills is one of the 1%.  He didn't want to show up. 
[00:07:00]  As is, I assume, these two.  Yeah, he doesn't want to be a phony about the whole thing.  Yeah.  So Stunt Brain writes me back.  He goes, dude, fucking mob scene.  Couldn't hear shit because, you know, these idiots show up with their acoustic guitars.  Assuming everyone's going to be able to hear them.  Yeah.  What song did they do?  Stunt Brain told me Teach Your Children.  Including Teach Your Children and Military Madness.  I don't know that song.  Teach Your Children.  Did they have to do mic check? 
[00:07:30]  Teach.  Teach!  Your children will.  Your children will.  Their father's down.  Goodbye, it's all.  We'll surely go by.  We'll surely go by.  And peace.  And peace.  No?  They didn't do that?  That's a great Occupy Wall Street bit right here.  You are on the road.  Must have a code.  Must have a code.  That you can live by.  And so. 
[00:08:00]  Become yourself.  Because the past.  Is just a good part.  These fucking idiots.  They couldn't hear them.  That's great.  They couldn't hear them at all.  Good.  According to Stunt Brain.  I'm sure if you were 10 feet in front.  But how many get the 10 feet in front spot?  I wish some crazy homeless guy would have grabbed his guitar and Elka bonged the two of them.  Elka bonged.  Elka bonged.  Hey.  Here's my problem.  The love ain't best. 
[00:08:30]  Here's my problem.  Like you said.  Graham Nash and David Crosby going down to Zuccotti Park.  All right.  It's not going to hurt anyone in the end.  But they're the 1%.  Like you're saying.  They are the 1%.  And all these celebrities showing up and they're like, hey, we're with you.  Yeah.  And then they walk away.  Open your wallet.  They should be opening their wallets for whatever cause.  I don't know.  I don't know where you send the money.  Yeah.  But if these guys are going to show up, they should be donating.  I would say celebrity going down there to support the protesters. 
[00:09:00]  That's a minimum of a million dollars you should be giving to somebody.  Yeah, sure.  A minimum of a million dollars.  You can't be David Crosby and Graham Nash go down there as the 1% saying you support.  Play your three songs and walk away.  No.  You can't be Michael Moore.  Oh, fucking Michael Moore.  You can't be fucking Michael Moore saying I support this shit and not donating to the cause.  You can't be Russell Simmons who has done it.  Who else has done it?  Unbelievably one of the 1% Michael Moore. 
[00:09:30]  Pick one of the fucking causes they're for and donate or something.  And make it very public.  Yeah.  Right?  Go ahead.  Do it.  Do it.  Go ahead.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  He knows it would just be wasted money spent on drugs.  I don't know.  And fucking chlamydia medication.  I don't know.  Fucking disgusting pigs down there.  A lot of people saying we should be supporting this movement.  Should we?  Yeah, a lot of people saying.  I am.  I am with my tax dollars.  A lot of people saying we should be supporting the movement. 
[00:10:00]  I am.  Our eyes are closed.  We got to open up our fucking eyes.  I'm going to open my eyes.  A bunch of people saying that.  My eyes are open.  One eyes shut and one eyes glued to a scope.  That's how I roll.  One eyes open and highly magnified.  Highly?  Well, Ed, I got to read some of this article for you.  Yeah.  A sun-splashed, tent-filled Zuccotti Park turned into a mini Woodstock.  It's not even close to a mini Woodstock. 
[00:10:30]  It is so not even close to anything resembling a mini Woodstock.  Just because two guys from Woodstock show up, you don't have to go with the Woodstock angle.  Doesn't make it a Woodstock.  Fuck.  Fucking hacks in the media.  What did he do?  Okay.  Mini Woodstock.  As the crowd sang along to teach your children and military madness.  Keep going, Crosby yelled to the crowd.  Crowded park.  No more war.  What?  That's their battle.  What is it?  What does he got? 
[00:11:00]  Alzheimer's?  He thinks he's fucking.  He thinks Vietnam's going on.  That's a hack thing to you.  It really is.  That's like saying in a comedy club, back me up, ladies.  No more war for a band is back me up, ladies.  What's he saying?  Can we hear him?  Is it good, Sam?  It's him, so I guess we got to hear a little of it.  All right.  Let me read a little more of this.  All right.  Maybe it's in this.  Let's see what he says.  All right.  Hit that.  God bless you, man.  God bless you.  God bless you, brother.  We know this song.  We know this song. 
[00:11:30]  So help us sing it, all right?  Yeah.  This is something I wrote 40 years ago.  It's still due today.  We have to teach our children.  We have to teach our children.  We have to teach our children.  We have to teach our children.  Who are they?  We have to teach.  We have to see.  Come on.  Do you want the road? 
[00:12:00]  Oh, man.  I've gotta get them.  Oh, yeah, I mean  You move past 20 feet you can't hear shit 
[00:12:30]  And see them on your dreams  There's some cops wearing quiet here to smash their teeth in  And see them on your own mind  Sing these with us  Don't you ever ask them why  If you told you it would be  Some cops getting raped right now in the tent  They're going to be able to hear this song again  Without thinking of a giant cop going in her ass 
[00:13:00]  And all they love you  Oh, God. All right. Enough of you. Enough of these people.  Go home!  I guess it's just special for them to show up and donate their time to sing a few songs.  I guess that's what some people would say.  I think it gives the movement a little more credibility.  Does it?  I just 
[00:13:30]  Oh, in the throng was Sheldon Classfeld.  Do you want to learn about Sheldon Classfeld?  Is he my banker?  58. I don't know if it's a woman or a man.  Sheldon.  Sheldon, I guess.  I would guess Sheldon?  58.  Who saw Crosby sing at Woodstock when Classfeld was 16.  All right.  It was emotional to hear him then.  It's emotional to hear him now.  Yeah.  He has a voice for the people.  The fact that he's here, it's very important for the crusade.  Through your tears. 
[00:14:00]  We're just as thrilled.  Was he crying?  I'm right here by Crosby and Nash and right by the photogs.  Let me tell you, I'm absolutely crying over here.  Through your fucking tears, you fucking homo.  There's a huge rumor that these guys are moving to Central Park.  Oh, good luck.  Because that's fucking city-owned, and you will see cops racking head then.  Well, if they allow them into Central Park, then I don't know what the fuck is going on. 
[00:14:30]  Because you're absolutely right.  They absolutely can't.  They shut down the park now.  You're not allowed in that park after the sun goes down.  They're outgrowing this little slab of park.  Huge rumor that they're moving to Central Park.  Good luck.  Yeah.  That'll get some fucking attention.  They will not even allow you to smoke in Central Park, but they're going to allow this?  I don't know.  We'll have to wait and see, I guess.  Actually, maybe they're doing that rumor just so people leave and they know they can get them out of there.  Blame.  Blame.  Nah, these people aren't leaving.  They're not going to be tricked. 
[00:15:00]  They're not going to be tricked.  Look over there.  They should have fun of those moves.  They're really not going to be...  They're really not going to cross the street and go, you guys should go there.  It's better.  Go there.  And then when they go there, you just take the other park away.  If they...  It doesn't exist.  It builds something on it.  If the rumor's true and they move to Central Park, then they know what the fuck they're doing.  They know something.  I'm telling you, they're not going to be tricked.  It's completely out of the realm of possibility that they would actually go there and not be physically removed by the NYPD.  And if they didn't, if they weren't removed, then there's something going on and Bloomberg should be thrown out of office. 
[00:15:30]  Unless Bloomberg's making some backdoor deal.  I'm sure he's making backdoor deals, but it has nothing to do with this movement.  That queen.  But maybe he'd decide, okay, we'll allow them in one part of the park.  Yeah.  It's more out of the way.  No way they're going to rope off an area that they can stay in.  I don't know.  This rumor's pretty fucking strong.  Oh, unless they're going to snake and nape the fucking park.  They won't let them in the Central Park.  No. 
[00:16:00]  But, you know, people are looking at this as a real possibility, so we'll have to wait and see.  It's supposedly going to go down this weekend.  And they're also going to march to D.C.  D.C. That's the latest on the Occupy Movement.  Stay there.  How are they going to march down the turnpike?  Is that where they're going to go?  I don't know.  The Jersey turnpike?  Well, usually when they do those marches, they find the side streets.  Oh, great.  There's other ways down there.  Especially if you're walking.  So they're going to join up with a movement that fucking pushes old ladies down fucking stairs. 
[00:16:30]  And yells at black guys that are actually working for a living that they're slaves to white people.  It's wonderful.  Oh, those are clips that I was watching.  These are the things that don't make it out.  Like, you know, if a cop fucking sprays mace, you see that.  But if you see protesters yelling at old ladies as they're falling down cement stairs and laying at the bottom of the stairs.  And then watching a black guy being called a slave to the white man because he's working security for a building. 
[00:17:00]  It's abominable what these fucking douchebags are doing.  Wait, you mean like the way that the one rumor about racism in the Tea Party was front page news?  Oh, exactly.  They could never even prove it, but this is not getting shown?  Yeah, calling him boy and everything.  Yeah, of course.  Why not?  What, the protesters calling him a black guy boy?  Yeah, yeah.  You're no brother.  You're no brother.  Where did this go down?  D.C.  Oh, D.C.  Yeah.  Well, some of these other cities, their occupies are a little more shady than New York even.  Oh, believe me.  The Philly one scared the fuck out of me. 
[00:17:30]  Philly's crazy.  I don't know what's going on in D.C.  I would like to know.  L.A. it seems like it's a bit strange as well.  Yeah.  Uh, people are pissed off and they have a reason to be pissed off.  They just want jobs.  They want to be part of society.  I'm here to help.  Society.  The system is against them, he said.  That was the guy that was at Woodstock and was watching Nash and Crosby.  See, you can't say their names without the Stills part.  I know.  It's Crosby, Stills, and Nash.  You can't go Crosby, Nash.  They pushed an old lady down the stairs. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Why did they push her down the stairs?  Uh, you know, they were kind of getting close.  And they're making like a human chain.  And these people who are apparently corporate greed people, I don't know, are coming out  of a little meeting, convention thing.  And, uh, this woman kind of slipped on the stairs and was on her ass. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, she looks greedy.  I don't like her.  Yeah, yeah.  Greedy old bag.  You old bag!  At least she's not dressed in a way to stand out in a protest.  Yeah.  Fucking orange on the floor.  And someone yells out, you know, you're great.  You're pushing old lady down the stairs.  They're just a bunch of fucking shitheads is what they are.  Bunch of fucking shitheads.  Who knows?  She may have tripped.  And what are they doing here?  Like, well, where are the police? 
[00:19:00]  This can't be legal to be able to block people's entrance and exits to a building, to harass  people that are coming and going from a private building.  If you want to go to some private park and hang out and smell each other's fucking shit,  that's your prerogative.  But, uh, to go to a public building like that and stand and yell at people's faces, where  are the police stopping that?  Well, they do their day trips.  Fucking, their day trip should be to fucking jail.  That was one of their day trips.  Get the cops out there. 
[00:19:30]  Start bashing some fucking teething.  Oh, they want to.  Love when the cops bash teeth.  Oh, you go down to Zuccotti Park, you see it in their eyes.  Oh, I love the Zuccotti.  You see the NYPD guys and you see it in their eyes.  They're like, oh, everyone's had it already with these fucking idiots.  Well, and I got to tell you, uh, on the Upper West Side two days ago, I filmed as a parade  was going by.  Oh, yeah?  Because they do these day things and they start a parade way uptown and they were going  to go all the way to Zuccotti Park on, what day is today?  Uh, Wednesday, I guess.  So it was a Monday. 
[00:20:00]  Did you see the stink fumes rising over the, uh, parade?  Well, uh, I'll say to the organizers of this Occupy shit, it, you know, the people I saw  were fucking losers.  Booms.  They were bums.  Yeah.  And, and as they're marching down the sidewalk, chanting drum circle, uh, pointing at everyone  on the street going, you are the 99%.  And these hardworking people that stopped to watch this freak show go by, you could see  it in their eyes.  It's like, look, I got a fucking job. 
[00:20:30]  Why aren't you working on a Monday?  Why don't you explain that?  Why you're not even working on a Monday and you're, you have the time to, to march on a  Monday all the way to Zuccotti Park as guys are slaving away and emptying trucks and dishing  out, uh, stupid pretzels and, you know, the, the working guys out there.  That's the 98%.  And then we're the 1%, the, you know, the elite.  And then these protesters are the 1% of people that aren't doing a fucking thing and, uh,  chastising the one with the other 1% on the other end of the spectrum. 
[00:21:00]  Even if things, but everybody, the majority of the people are the working people that are  just trying to live.  But you know, I'm in a different place than, than the average person out there.  So I got to remove myself.  But what I did see it was in the, in the eyes of some of these guys like fucking rolling  their eyes.  Like seriously, I'm out here fucking slaving away.  Hey, where's your job?  You should join us.  It's like, yeah, should I and get fired?  I'm working here.  Yeah.  Working, working hard too.  Jackasses.  My thing is if there was a drastic change in this country, these people, a lot of these 
[00:21:30]  people that are part of this wouldn't be hired even at that point.  No, no.  If, if unemployment was zero, these people would somehow still be unemployed.  You see it in their eyes.  You're like, no one's going to fucking hire half these people.  Do you know, I was going to go down there to complain because I think that I don't want  to seem like I'm out of touch.  Yes, Jimmy.  But I think that certain amenities on the airlines in the first class are not what they used  to be.  There you go.  That's a good thing to protest.  I think that it's sloppy business.  And I think that a lot of times they don't have hot meals on the, on the red eyes after 
[00:22:00]  charging a first class premium.  Yes.  And I think that that's something that should be fought for.  Yes.  Jimmy, God bless you because as much as that is funny and all, if you went down to Zuccotti  Park, you probably would see a guy bitching about it.  I have a guy on tape that is mad at a seafood company.  I'm like, what does this have to do with anything?  He's mad at a particular seafood company and he gets to stage down there.  Hey, hey.  Ho, ho.  There's not enough leg room in my row. 
[00:22:30]  Hey, hey.  Ho, ho.  There's not enough leg room in my row.  And he's not even famous.  Hey, hey.  I'll just say it, you know, I'll say it to the organizers.  You don't look good out there if you're really trying to get something real going.  Because there's a lot of people that are, you know, unhappy in this country.  But when you see this parade coming through your neighborhood and you see a whole bunch  of unhirable losers pointing at working guys and going, you are the 99%. 
[00:23:00]  No.  Like they're supposed to like stop unloading the truck or whatever they're doing and join  this fucking parade.  Yeah.  Where's your job?  Are you even trying to get a job out there?  Start there.  No.  They're bums.  And the stupid celebrities, you know, if you're going down there, you got to donate.  You got to donate.  Your time isn't good enough.  To show up and play three acoustic songs and then walk away. 
[00:23:30]  That's, I don't really understand what that does in the end.  How long have they been down there?  What?  Zuccotti?  Yeah.  Six weeks?  I think they're up to about.  And they're fucking dug in, man.  They're not leaving.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Brett Ratner.  Here's another fucking situation.  We just had him in.  Yeah.  Good.  And he's not doing the Oscars anymore because of a dumb throwaway line.  A dumb throwaway line.  He's the newest hostage.  They're going to hold him hostage? 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  He's the new hostage.  Because he has a connection to Teddy Murphy, too.  Yeah.  Tracy Morgan, who was held hostage by GLAAD, and then the other acronym that I don't know  what it means, but it adds in the fucking guys that have tits and dicks.  Yeah.  It's gentlemen that decided to put tits on their chest.  No.  Put a wig on their head, yet still have big, giant cocks and fucking Turkish taffy balls.  Some do, yes.  Yes.  I must draw the line in this type of slander.  What's the matter, Jimmy? 
[00:24:30]  You don't like that?  I don't like this slander of these fine people.  I don't know what that acronym is.  I know GLAAD.  GLAAD is the Gay and Lesbian Alliance for Anti-Defamation or something.  I don't know.  What is it?  Don't they throw a B in there or something?  That's LBGBT or something?  What is the LBGBT?  I don't know.  It's lesbian.  I think I work for that radio station.  No, wait.  What is it?  It's a lesbian, bisexual, and men that make themselves grow tits, yet have giant cocks. 
[00:25:00]  Only some have giant cocks.  Now you have your different, the Asian breakdowns are not quite as good.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's not slander all these folks.  They just have cocks.  And we're supposed to have an open mind about that as well.  You're supposed to know the acronym and know what I can and can't say about gentlemen,  about men.  No.  They're ladies.  They're ladies.  Oh, really?  Yes, they certainly are.  Jesus Christ, they're not fucking ladies.  You know what?  They certainly are.  Are you not a Democrat if you say you're a Democrat for Pete's sake?  If you ask me, if it's got a cock and balls, it's a gentleman. 
[00:25:30]  Well, you know, it's kind of hard to argue that logic, but I think that if someone says  they're a lady for Pete's sake, who am I to judge?  Jesus.  Who am I to judge?  All right.  Good point, madam.  Jimmy might have some, you know, different thoughts on this.  He might have a fetish or two.  That's right.  Holy shit.  Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender community.  The LGBT.  Get rid of the T.  I'll accept the L, the G, the B. 
[00:26:00]  But get rid of the T.  You don't want the T?  No!  No, because you're so right.  Transgender.  You're really getting niche-y here.  Right.  Just say the gay community.  That adds everybody under the gay umbrella.  Unless they dress properly, like maybe a woman from this day and age.  All right, maybe.  Like Bailey J.  Bailey J is a lovely girl.  Bailey J.  What?  Who's Bailey J?  I saw the clip, by the way, which is hilarious.  A clip from Bob Kelly's podcast when Jimmy, Joe DeRosa, Bailey J, and Bailey's husband 
[00:26:30]  were in Bobby's house doing the podcast.  Yeah.  Joe DeRosa is fawning over this transgender gentleman slash woman.  Lady!  And trying so hard to get something going.  Yeah.  He was really authentically trying to get something going.  What?  He wants to suck Bailey J's cock and shuffle the balls around a little bit.  Or maybe get a dick in the ass by Bailey J. 
[00:27:00]  And that's not gay.  No.  I don't know.  Of course not.  Is that gay?  I'm very confused by this.  If you're in a bad...  Oh, boy.  I'm flying to L.A. today.  Does that make me a pilot?  You just belong for the ride?  All right.  I'm very confused by this.  Put it that way.  If you want to be gay, be gay.  But don't make believe you're not.  Well, that's just it.  It's, you know...  I think Joe is just open-minded.  And Bailey J is a lovely lady.  Joe's confused because Bailey J looks kind of like one of those nerdy-looking girls kind 
[00:27:30]  of a thing.  That's Bailey J?  Yeah, that's Bailey J.  She's very funny, too.  Bailey J also sounds like a girl.  And that's Bailey J's hubby.  What?  And that's Joe DeRosa fawning, drunkenly laughing and fawning.  He would so suck Bailey J's big, bent dick.  And who is Bailey J?  She's a transsexual performer of the year.  Yeah, yeah.  But she doesn't do that many movies, but she's so girl-like.  To be fair, this clip we're looking at, she looks like she could be a female. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  She's very, very passable, as they say.  Passable?  Yeah, passable.  We're interviewing this girl, Bailey J.  Girl, see Joe.  She's transsexual.  Sorry to use the word because I know you don't like her.  I don't hate it on a liberal level.  I just...  But I'm like, we're interviewing this girl.  And I'm like, I would...  I'm straight.  I would jerk this girl off.  I would give her a handjob.  I would give her a handjob.  I would fucking suck her balls.  Bob.  Bobby.  But that's not straight shit. 
[00:28:30]  Joe would jerk off Bailey J.  That's not straight shit.  Sure I can.  What do you mean?  You can do that and still be straight?  Of course you can.  Look at me.  Jimmy's throwing his arms up.  Of course you can.  Oh, what is this?  Narrow-minded central?  Of course you can.  You can't say I'm straight, but I would jerk him off.  Or her off.  You can't be a good guy, too?  Who says you can't be straight and a good guy?  Now, it's a girl in every sense of the word, except for the fact that it has the one thing 
[00:29:00]  that separates girls from guys.  A big hairy dick.  Oh, I thought you were going to say an executive job.  Oh, the penis thing is irrelevant.  Higher pay.  Absolutely.  Is it less gay if it's completely shaved?  A sense of humor.  Is it less gay if it's completely shaved?  Less manly if it's completely shaved?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It would have to be completely shaved.  You don't want big man pubes in your nose.  I would hope not.  Yes.  Or looking like President Taft as you're sucking a dick. 
[00:29:30]  By the way, the creepy part is that I'm...  Because I went over in the middle of the podcast.  Yes, of course you did.  I'm eating...  Well, of course, for Bailey J.  I'm actually...  I hadn't seen any...  I know who she is, but I actually had not seen her stuff.  But I just know the name.  Right.  And I had gone over and I was eating soup.  Because I was really...  What really got me over there is that Dawn made a fucking sausage soup theme.  And I was...  It's a thematic soup for the...  And I'm eating soup during this fucking interview. 
[00:30:00]  She's enabling cockplay.  Were you deep-throating the soup?  No.  They were little pieces of sausage.  Oh.  I just threw it in my face and yelled, please.  Why sausage?  I don't know.  Because.  All right, let's...  In honor of the guest.  Let's listen to Joe DeRose and Bob Kelly make believe they're not gay.  Yeah.  Let's all make believe.  Bob's a married man.  Let's make believe.  Married man, are you?  But I heard he said something about sucking balls.  Yes.  But let's make believe that's a straight activity.  Yeah, of course it is.  Okay, let's all make believe.  Absolutely.  No, no, no, no, no.  All right, hit it.  I won't have this.  Dude, I would fucking suck her balls. 
[00:30:30]  32 double D.  Wow.  Yeah, I'm a little and I threw a huge rack.  Was that one operation or was it several?  It was two.  Well, it was two.  How big is your...  My what?  You mean my pussy?  My pussy's huge, you know?  What size...  What size...  Why are you afraid to say the word?  No.  It's gift.  My man...  It's gift.  My man, Clint.  You mean my man, Clint?  You have hips.  You have child...  Childbearing hips. 
[00:31:00]  That's a...  No, not childbearing.  I'm a baby maker.  I have a creepier vibe right now than that guy in Fame.  I really had a sucker fuck.  I had cocoa.  Put your thumb in your mouth.  I made her cry.  But close that for a second.  I hope that's funny.  The thing that's funny about Bailey...  Look at you in the middle of eating soup.  I'm eating soup.  I don't care.  None of it's surprising to me.  See, some soup?  Good food?  Plenty of it?  This is a regular day for Jimmy.  He's just enjoying his soup.  Really?  The funny part is though, Bailey...  Her birth name is Brian, but she's not one of those transsexuals that shies away from 
[00:31:30]  that.  Like, oh, I don't want to ask you.  She's like, I'm Brian.  But dude...  Like, she actually says that.  Like, yeah, I get a dick.  She's different than most of the transsexuals of...  Look at that.  ...that you've spoken to.  Yeah, or actually even seen interviewed.  Hmm.  She's got the 32 double Ds.  Do they look like man nipples though?  No.  Because that's the problem with some of this shit too.  They've got the big over-the-top tits, but they've got man nipples on them.  Yeah.  No, I'll send you a picture of the breasts.  I have a picture of the breasts.  And I can see...  Yes.  DeRosa... 
[00:32:00]  Did she get naked for you guys?  She showed her tits.  DeRosa is drinking.  And the more he drinks, the more that is just purely a fantasy for him that he wants  to fulfill.  A cute girl with a giant cock.  He's drinking his justification.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like...  He's justified.  Like, Joe wants this so bad.  Let's hear the rest of this.  It's pretty goddamn funny.  I hope after I pee in a minute they just leave the toilet seat open and it sticks. 
[00:32:30]  Well, I have a bidet downstairs and there's a him and her button, so you're gonna be...  I'll have to...  I'll be sitting there contemplating that for a very long time.  You're gonna...  Which one?  You're gonna have to hit the him.  There's no shim option.  A shim option?  It's gonna hit you balls if you hit the her.  My cock is...  What is it, Matt?  I don't even know.  It's like six, six and a half inches.  Like six and a half inches.  It's a giant cock.  It's a fat dick.  And I don't... 
[00:33:00]  I don't imitate myself...  So is Matt...  Hold on.  I'm really trying to figure this shit out.  So is Matt gay?  Because he's with her?  Her husband?  I think he is.  Wait, they're married?  They're actually married, yeah.  I'm really confused.  They do a podcast and they live in upstate New York.  So what...  Did he start his life...  Is he gay?  Is he gay?  Matt?  Yes.  I didn't speak to him that much.  I'm assuming so.  I would assume because...  I don't know who he dated before.  I'm gonna guess he's dated trannies and men.  That's my guess.  I don't know.  I didn't talk to him.  I only spoke to him on...  I guess if you're sucking cock every time you get intimate with your significant other, 
[00:33:30]  it's probably gay.  But then why isn't Joe like gay for wanting to fucking...  He wants to experiment.  Well, if you...  Because...  Really?  So if you want to join the army, all of a sudden you're a soldier?  Is that how it works?  Just visiting?  Yeah.  I want to go to law school.  I guess I'm a lawyer.  My favorite one is...  My favorite one you did and I don't remember the wording was the Europe one.  I'll go to Europe and come back.  You're still an American.  You're still an American.  Ah, there you go.  I love that one.  I only spoke to them...  Because I had to get up the next morning.  So I spoke to them on the podcast and then we all walked to the corner at the end and 
[00:34:00]  I went home and Joe and them went out for a beverage.  So I don't know what actually happened.  He wonders what happened.  So DeRosa went out with the two of them afterwards for the beverage?  Yeah, I think they just went out for a beer.  Oh.  Huh?  I wonder.  I wonder if there was any hijinks in maybe the bathroom or something.  Probably not.  Is she on hormones or whatever?  I don't...  I'm assuming so.  She said no.  Oh, then she said no.  Then why the voice?  The voice is...  I don't know.  She said no. 
[00:34:30]  No.  Because I watched this interview and in this interview she says no and that's why she's  still got the cock and the big balls.  Because what?  That shit shrinks down, right?  That shit shrivels down and that's why he, she, whatever it is can still get a rod.  All right, let's listen to the rest.  This is good shit, by the way.  Yeah, it's funny.  Whose podcast was this?  Bob Kelly.  Bobby.  And it's two and a half hours.  This is like the second half in.  I missed the first half.  I was home.  I inundate myself with hormones because I just never needed them.  I just... 
[00:35:00]  Right.  It's kind of like the icon.  So your voice...  It's your voice.  I like sucking dick.  And not because I want the guy to like me.  I like sucking dick because I want to taste a dick.  Wow.  Norton, you got dressed up for tonight, I swear to God.  I got dressed up, but you know, I tried to, you know, go out and ride.  The rose is all nervous.  You just had to have like a white striped to match the sneakers on.  Exactly.  Yeah, you know, I tried to do that.  In hindsight, I would have ruined that shirt.  So...  What was you...  What do you mean?  I would have fucking...  Never would have worn that shirt ever again.  It would have been a cum rag. 
[00:35:30]  You should have jizzed all over fucking Joe's brand new shirt he bought.  I thought at least we'd make it back to my place after a night of drinking.  The three of us.  And then, you know, perhaps something happens.  Who knows?  He's trying right there.  That's not far.  Could you pause it?  Could you pause it a minute?  If you notice, right there, he was actually trying.  That was his move.  Like, I was thinking we could do this, and he's waiting to hear like, oh, that'd be cool.  That'd be cool.  Like, he's waiting to hear that.  He threw that out there. 
[00:36:00]  Well, he was saying, because this is a long podcast, it's a shorter clip, that I think  he was going to invite Bailey and her, because Bobby didn't tell him that she's married and  that her husband was coming.  Right, right.  So Joe was, then when he found out they were, I think, together, he was hoping the three  of them would go back.  Yeah, yeah.  To the apartment and stay in his apartment.  Yeah, yeah.  And something would happen, he even said.  Yeah.  He wants the cock.  Joe wants the cock.  And, uh, it really, what was your big line as you two were kissing, you were going to 
[00:36:30]  say, like, I've never been so confused and had so much clarity at the same time.  It's not happening, homo.  It doesn't take a line.  Like, I literally put my dick in the mouth of a person in the middle of a line.  Like, it's, it doesn't take that much effort.  I'm going to fuck my wife with my fucking, with a, with a banana in my mouth. 
[00:37:00]  Hey, this is Bailey J.  Shit.  Hey, this is Bailey J.  You're listening to the You Know What Dude podcast on gloryholeradio.com.  Suck my fat she-cock.  She's hugging Joe.  A kiss.  Okay.  Almost looks female.  One more.  Ready?  I did it.  No, no, no.  No, sorry.  I love it.  You know how awesome that would be if she just mushed her cock on his cheek?  Then he'd realize, wait a minute, I'm like, oh no, I'm running this. 
[00:37:30]  I'm running this.  Take it back.  I'm running this.  Take it back.  Then he'd realize he'd stay yawning too late and we all know.  That's hilarious.  Good shit.  Good shit.  Yeah, it's great.  It's YK, you know what, dude?  YKWD podcast.  I guess it's on iTunes.  Yeah.  We're going to get Bobby's podcast.  I'm not sure.  Or just go to Robert Kelly on Twitter.  He's always tweeting when he's podcasting.  I'm sure you'll find it.  That is so fucking funny because the image that Bobby conjures up with Joe DeRosa at  the end of that, like Bailey kissed Joe on the cheek and Joe was like, oh, like a little 
[00:38:00]  school boy.  And she went back to her seat and then it was said like, oh, what if she put her cock  against his cheek?  And Bobby's like, that would be when he realizes he doesn't want it.  And he's like, no, I'm not into this.  I'm not into this.  Hilarious.  Fucking Bobby.  Yeah, that was fun.  And listening to Bob try to be like diplomatic and ask smart questions was really, really  funny.  Billy's got that nerdy kind of look thing going on. 
[00:38:30]  If you didn't know it was a guy, you wouldn't know it was a guy kind of a thing.  I agree with you.  But yeah, but once that cock comes out, I imagine that is a telltale sign.  But she doesn't hide.  Like I like what I liked about her personality.  She's really funny and she didn't hide that stuff.  Like a lot.  Again, a lot of people.  It's like a girl with fake tits.  Yeah.  Like, oh, I don't talk about my tits being like that.  Like she's the type that would just go.  Oh, yeah.  You like my fake tits?  Yeah.  Fake.  Is that a wig?  I don't know.  I didn't think that's lustrous hair. 
[00:39:00]  No, she's going with those.  The bangs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The straight across.  She's got the straight across and the straight, straight black hair kind of a thing.  Yeah.  I don't know.  She said that the other trannies don't like her because she's done so few movies and is...  No, the other trannies don't like her because the other trannies are like this.  Which is fucking shaving every two hours.  And they probably don't like trannies that actually can pull off the girl thing.  Well, some of them can, but they've done a lot more movies.  She's only done a couple of movies and then to win performer of the year is what I think pissed a lot. 
[00:39:30]  Maybe it was one big, great performance.  I think if you're going to be a tranny, you've got to be wispy to begin with.  Yeah, you can't be a manly fucking thing.  You can't be a tranny.  No.  You're funny.  No, I would make an awful tranny.  You already have an awful man.  You're an awful man's shadow.  I didn't shave, but thank you.  But, you know, you'd be shaving constantly.  Oh, it'd be terrible.  I think Sam probably could have pulled it off a few years ago.  When he was 21, maybe, or 19?  Yeah, like when we first met young Sam, he could have pulled it off. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  Now, forget it.  Nah, he's guessing.  You're over.  Yeah.  You're done.  You're a man now.  It'd be a tranny with razor bumps.  Yeah.  Nobody would like that.  No.  No.  You're now the guy that, like, if a guy was with you and you were a twink, he's now nervous  that you're going to knock on his door.  Like, huh?  What you did to me?  Oh, shit.  He's old now.  All right.  We're going to, uh, we should break, and then we'll get into the Brett Ratner, uh, controversy. 
[00:40:30]  We've got Brett Ratner.  We've got the Penn State controversy.  Oh, it was a moving, moving, moving moment last night.  Oh, was it?  Moving moment.  On the lawn?  Moving moment.  Yeah.  What a perfect time for a fucking, uh, pep rally.  You know, you could support someone, but maybe you ought to keep it on the QT.  Well, no, he handled it really well.  Handled it really well.  Made a brief mention about the boys who'd probably been fucked in the ass, but at least  he got the Penn State shit going.  And then went, anyway, enough of that. 
[00:41:00]  Let's move on to how great I am and what I've done for Penn State.  Instead of just standing there and actually saying nothing but this, I appreciate it,  but the support should all be going to the boys that were fucking raped.  He's old school.  He doesn't care.  Old school.  He's a doddering old fool now.  And boy, the Pennsylvania people really just are blinded by, by just passion and it's  almost a Nazi Germany-like, um, loyalty to the Fuhrer, uh, with, with, uh, this guy. 
[00:41:30]  They will not give him what they love him.  And, and, and if you say anything, you're an asshole.  I, I think, I think people are turning quickly though.  No, I really, I see a lot of people in Pennsylvania saying like, they're turning on this guy quickly.  Like, what the fuck, dude?  There's, there's, someone told me that this, uh, Sandusky, whatever the fuck his name is,  was in the, the, the weight room last week.  Oh yeah?  He's, he was, he's always around.  Still.  Why wouldn't he be?  Good pickings there.  I know what.  Why don't he have a good fishing spot? 
[00:42:00]  It really is a stocked lake, isn't it?  And if they're going to allow you to keep coming back to the lake, why wouldn't you?  So you almost don't blame the guy.  It's a fucking three foot deep lake with a, he's got a big net.  Well, there's no reason to not go there.  Wearing waders and nothing else.  I don't fuck boys and I want to go.  The number's up to 20, I think.  20 victims so far.  Wow.  Wow.  Supposedly, uh, uh, protection orders against his own grandkids.  This guy's a piece of shit.  Uncle Paul's fucking disgusted. 
[00:42:30]  Huh?  No, I'm not.  I like Jerry.  Do ya?  Yeah.  Me and that Sandusky fella was good friends.  Oh, shit.  Touchdown.  Yeah.  Yay.  Yay.  I used to look at the shower doors and make sure nobody came in.  Oh, you are the guy.  Look out.  Sure.  Sure.  Oh, no.  You are?  Aw, look how cute.  Oh, my fault.  Uncle Paul from the morning mashup with her little dog.  Look at the dog so eager.  Does it make nervous wee-wee? 
[00:43:00]  No.  All right.  I don't know.  It's not pee or poo or anything in here.  But I don't know.  I'm afraid I'm going to drop her, though.  Like, I don't want her to fall.  What kind of dog is that?  It's kind of cute.  Oh, look at that.  It looks like a sheep stew.  It's a cute dog.  What am I supposed to say?  Is she going to bite the wires?  She's not going to do anything.  What?  She's the perfect dog?  She's perfect.  Bobby!  She's rubbing her asshole on the rug.  She's scooting.  She's scooting on the rug.  She just did the asshole scoot on the rug.  A little cranky ass.  You've got to wipe that asshole better.  Yeah. 
[00:43:30]  She's just going to want to run around.  You guys don't have to take her.  You're the ones who told me to bring her in.  She won't pee on my luggage.  She won't pee on your luggage.  Are we going to step on her?  No.  She's tiny.  She's on the floor now.  I don't even know where she is.  Thank you.  Do you have a bag to put her in?  No.  Yeah.  She's very cute.  You know we might have a rat in here.  You do?  Yeah.  It was either the headphones cord or there's a rat in here.  Are you joking?  No.  I'm just letting you know.  I think so.  Why don't you tell engineering or management?  I told Mars.  But Ant said it happened to him, so I think it might be the headphone cord. 
[00:44:00]  No.  I think it's the cord.  Yeah.  The mic cord.  Something freaked me out yesterday and I thought something was nibbling on me.  But it could have been the headphone cord.  Just letting you know ahead of time.  Yeah.  Because that would be a great fight.  Where are you going?  You're a dog and a rat.  I'm going to do my show now.  Yeah.  Oh, you're not leaving.  Okay, good.  So if the dog is too crazy, you'll take...  I was afraid that you were leaving the building.  No, I will take the dog back.  I got frightened.  You don't have to be frightened.  All right.  What if the door stays open and the dog runs out?  Then I'll kill you.  I don't want that to happen.  No, I don't either.  Is there anything the dog can fall into?  Like a door or something? 
[00:44:30]  A trap door?  What the fuck is this?  I don't know.  A dungeon?  No, but there's a fucking...  There's a lot of electric shit under here.  And what if the dog gets nervous and tinkles on the fucking wire?  It's not going to happen.  It's all low voltage down there.  Is it?  Perfect.  I don't know.  Really?  And there's fucking...  We're on a raised floor.  I just want her to leave so I can break out the old peanut butter.  She can eat peanut butter.  She can eat whatever.  All right.  All right.  I eat right off the head of my dick.  No, not on your penis.  Please.  I want to rub it on my ball sack.  Please do not do that.  Off your finger is fine. 
[00:45:00]  What a cute...  What's her name?  My name is Phoebe.  If a guy is...  Phoebe!  If a guy is attracted to a tranny that has a penis and balls, what does it make the guy?  If a guy is attracted...  Like this girl right here in the middle.  She has a penis and balls?  Yeah, yeah.  And who's attracted to her?  Are you just...  No, who isn't is the question.  Joe DeRosa kind of hinted at that.  Joe DeRosa...  He wouldn't mind maybe...  Jerking her off.  Jerking her off.  I guess it makes you confused.  Confused?  You go with confused?  What about a one-off?  Just once and one and done? 
[00:45:30]  No, because then you're going to still have the experience with the penis, and that's  gay.  And Bobby was talking about maybe sucking on the balls.  No, you're not doing that.  The confusion is...  Look, I'm not Bobby.  Who's Bobby?  Bobby Kelly.  Bobby Kelly.  Oh, Bobby is not doing that.  By the way, that's the reaction show business has had.  Yeah, confusion is a good word.  It's like getting into a fucking...  It's like getting into a BMW and seeing the Mercedes thing on the front of the hood.  What is this?  Like, what is it?  It's all great, but what's happening?  It's all great. 
[00:46:00]  It's all luxury and fun.  Well, enjoy your tranny talk and my dog, and if you hurt her, I'll kill you.  I never hurt animals.  I'm very nice to animals.  Put the little mat down.  Yeah, yeah.  And your little toys.  We've got to put a sign on the door, though, so nobody just walks in and the dog...  Someone will...  I'll watch the dog.  No, it's in a building.  Nothing's going to happen.  I don't want to run it down the fucking hall yelling, yelp, yelp.  Come back and check on your dog.  Thanks so much for being a babysitter, Opie.  You've got the hits to play right now, though.  Yeah, I do.  Go play some hits.  Good evening, Opie.  Come here, puppy. 
[00:46:30]  Stay.  Oh.  Stay.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Now the dog's freaking out.  Uh-oh.  Oh, look at the dog's face.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh.  Dog forgot about her already.  Phoebe.  Phoebe, come here.  No.  Opie, don't let the dog out.  No.  No.  Get the door open trying to convince the dog.  What a good dog.  Phoebe, don't let that heavy door smash on the dog.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh, no.  The dog is adorable.  Phoebe. 
[00:47:00]  Come here.  Come here, you little shithead.  Fucking dog won't come to me.  Well, why would the dog?  The dog knows you're not a nice person and you don't like training.  Ah, I'm great.  I like the dog.  What the hell?  It's adorable.  Should we take a break?  Yes, we should.  I want to pet the animal.  We've got the Brett Ratner controversy.  We'll do a little more Joe Paterno.  Maybe play the audio from outside his house.  It was really moving to hear him being comforted.  Yeah, we've got to hear that.  He needed comfort yesterday.  Yeah, of course he did.  It was very important.  Yeah.  And Kurt Loder basically saying, no, he did say that Michael Jackson touched kids. 
[00:47:30]  That's a big controversy today.  Wow, wow.  The Herman Cain thing.  Lots to do, man.  Yeah, a lot of controversies.  And Tom Papa joining us and Andy Dick a little later.  Controversies.  This, this is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony.  For Sirius XM.  Hey, this is John Velby.  Hey, this is Larry the Cable Guy.  Hey, folks, this is Mark Maron.  Hey, this is comedian Nick DiPoli.  What's up?  This is Joe Rogan.  You are listening to the O.P. and Anthony Show, my favorite show in the history of the  fucking universe.  This is Joe Rogan. 
[00:48:00]  We can touch each, snuggle up, and get stuck. 
[00:48:30]  Believe it or not, here comes a brother with clothes.  Snuggling, bubbling, overweight, loving.  Is this Heavy D?  I don't know.  I'm not going to make believe I know.  I guess we'd have to go to the experts to find out if it is.  Heavy E, is this Heavy D?  Yeah, Twitter wasn't saying that all last night.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I didn't hear it.  I'm late to the party.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Twitter doesn't talk.  It's people that talk on Twitter.  Heavy D, dead at 44, huh?  Yeah, man.  You kidding?  It's going to come back as a heart attack, obviously. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  It's got to be.  He seemed healthy, everyone is saying.  He went to the hospital yesterday, and that was it.  Wow.  His last tweet was, be inspired.  All right.  And the tweet before that was doing a whole R.I.P. Joe Frazier.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  That was his last two tweets.  So, we lost the Heavy Day.  Sam, you know anything about Heavy Day?  I mean, a little bit.  It was a little before my time, but, uh...  Jesus, really?  It's your time.  Yeah.  How fucking young are you?  What song is this, 85, 87? 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, I'm 20.  Are you a child of the 80s?  I was not a child of the...  Well, I was born in the 80s, but I was...  Wow.  Well, you're looking at children of the 80s.  Yeah, exactly.  So...  Yeah.  So, we know.  We know a little bit more about Heavy Day.  But the hip-hop community is certainly grieving today.  A big influence on a lot of the guys, right?  Yes.  Are they doing a special across the hall there on Shade?  I would hope so.  Shady Shade.  Is Eminem coming in to kick it off?  I would imagine if Heavy Day died, Eminem must be coming in today.  To make sure that it's done properly. 
[00:50:00]  I think they're going to let Sway handle it.  But it's his channel.  But it's his channel.  Eminem's channel.  Shade.  He should...  Yeah.  He probably should come in...  Yeah, with the backwards E.  And represent.  Yeah, no.  I think for this one, I think Sway is going to handle the Heavy Lifting.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I think he's doing a lot of research.  So, the death wasn't important enough for Eminem?  Who would have to die for Eminem to come in there?  Well, Tupac's already gone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know if... 
[00:50:30]  Just keep paying Eminem.  Yeah, I think at this point...  Completely makes sense.  What about Diddy?  I don't think...  I don't know.  I may...  Probably not.  No.  I don't think he would come in as Diddy died.  What's it going to take for Eminem to actually come in here?  And sit behind the microphone.  An act of God?  Well, he was in here...  He's been in here once since we've been here, for sure.  At least one time.  One time.  And that was in the afternoon, so who could talk to him?  You know what would happen to us if we only showed up one time?  Our channel would have more listeners.  More entertaining.  You showed up one time since we've been here. 
[00:51:00]  No, no, no.  I said...  We're up to two and a half years in this building.  I said at least one time.  It could have been twice.  Might have been twice, Anne.  Could have been as many as...  Might have been twice.  Might have been twice.  Just two times.  Twice.  And what were their reasons?  His album had come out.  Except his album before, the newest one, when that came out, he came in here.  The newer album, he had the guy who runs Shade 45 go to Detroit to interview him.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Was it important for him to get on a plane and come to New York to be on his own channel? 
[00:51:30]  No.  When his album came out?  People from here got him to go to his house.  For what?  A 20-minute interview?  Yeah.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, God.  Don't be in a bad mood.  They broadcast his concert.  What?  Last time he did a concert at Yankee Stadium, they broadcast it.  Yeah.  So...  Did they interview him backstage?  I don't think they got him.  Oh, my God.  Did his own channel really not get him? 
[00:52:00]  I'm not positive.  His own channel didn't get him.  What do you think I'm getting at?  But they did broadcast the show.  The concert.  Yeah, but anyone could almost do that if you pay him enough.  Yeah.  I mean, that's true.  It's just a matter of broadcasting.  They probably had to pay him extra for that.  I would bet money they had to pay him extra for that.  I'm sure.  Oh, I'm sure.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  That had nothing to do with the original deal.  No.  The original deal?  You didn't say live concerts.  Pay me.  How do we get these stupid contracts that some of these guys get?  And 50...  How do we get that? 
[00:52:30]  An agent.  An agent would help.  Yeah, that does help.  Good point.  Still hasn't called about Patrice or anything else going on.  That's smart, Bob.  Really fucking smart.  Keep taking my 10%.  Why not?  Ooh.  50 Cent calls in on the weekends.  Yeah.  But he insists that that counts towards his whatever.  Obligation.  Because he also has a contractual obligation to appear.  Oh, if he has some obligations, yeah.  I mean, it's hours a year, though.  It's not like...  Hours a year.  Like you're talking, you know...  Holy fuck.  We did hours already today.  That's true.  I mean...  We're into hour number two. 
[00:53:00]  We're into hours already.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, of course we are.  We do fucking four hours and then the shit show.  Is it safe to say that we've already done more radio today than Eminem will do this entire  year?  That's safe.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, the year's almost over.  That's very safe to say.  Oh, but only today we've done more hours.  Yeah.  An hour and 17 minutes by my calculation.  Today we have done...  Yeah.  We've already done more work.  Right.  And they don't understand how we're extremely pissed off.  Yeah.  Yes.  Don't get it. 
[00:53:30]  Phoebe Wiebelstein in studio, by the way.  Who?  The dog, Phoebe Wiebelstein.  All right.  I'm not talking about the dog.  What is Nicole's...  The dog's doing okay.  What is her Twitter?  Mashup Nicole.  Thank you.  Oh, yeah.  Um, so, uh, we got Joe Paterno.  He, uh...  Oh, God.  Poor God.  This fucking guy...  This fucking guy is going to be let go, most likely by the end of the week.  You think so, huh?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And, um, he was supposed to have a press conference yesterday.  Right.  And it was canceled.  I don't know if it was canceled by him or the university.  Oh, they probably told him.  Yeah, you keep this under wraps. 
[00:54:00]  Shut up.  I'm not really sure.  But he decided to kind of do a little thing outside his house yesterday.  Yeah.  And, um, these, uh, these fans that obviously love to have blinders on decided it was a  perfect opportunity to have a pep rally outside of Joe Paterno's, uh, house.  Well, basically, I agree with it because I think the pride in Penn State's history of  football is more important...  Than kid-touching.  Well, not even kid-touching.  Apparently kid-fucking. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  And I think that, yeah, kid-fucking's bad, but the reality is this is good football.  Yeah.  And those...  And you can't throw Joe Paterno under the bus.  He did the right thing.  I mean, when you hear that someone's fucking possibly an 11-year-old, you shouldn't go to  the police.  You should go to the university president.  Because that's what you'd do if it was one of your own kids.  Yeah.  Like, if he heard that one of his own kids or his grandchild was being molested or fucked  in the ass in a shower, he would go to the university president.  Well, football transcends that. 
[00:55:00]  That's what he would do.  And that's why all these Penn State fans are not being blinded idiots.  Don't write.  Don't say that on Twitter, because these fucking idiots don't understand.  He did what he was supposed to do.  Absolutely.  He went to the university president.  He did the absolute minimum.  You don't go to the police.  Minimum.  Yeah.  When it comes to children being fucked, he did the absolute minimum just to squeak by.  And he has so much power at that college that he could have got a lot done. 
[00:55:30]  And chose not to.  And that's why I say he's failed as a human being.  He has failed as a human being.  He did not do what he was supposed to do in that situation.  And even the first kid who went to him.  Right.  I get it's your job.  There's a lot of people that are guilty.  No one did the right thing.  No one.  Except for Sandusky.  He knew what he was doing.  The guy took the bull by the horns.  So, here's the video outside Paterno's house yesterday.  The media showed up.  Joe walked out of his house.  A shitty house, by the way.  If he's such a god in those parts, why not get him a better house? 
[00:56:00]  Got a little lousy house?  I didn't think the house was that great considering he's a legend, right?  Well.  Hit this.  Earlier this evening, a wild scene with several students outside the home.  Joe Paterno actually came out of his house and addressed the students who were in front of his home.  Oh, he's smiling.  We want Joe!  We want Joe!  We want Joe! 
[00:56:30]  We want Joe!  We want Joe!  And I want you!  We want Joe!  And I want you guys.  I thought that was a woman.  Yeah.  It's hard for me to tell you how much this means to me.  All right?  You guys, I've lived through this place.  I've lived through people like you guys and girls.  And I'm just so happy to see that, you know, that you could feel so strongly about us and about your school.  Right?  And as I said to you, whether you heard me or not, is, you know, with the kids who were victims. 
[00:57:00]  That is a death rattle.  Whatever they want to say, I think we ought to say a prayer for them.  Because, you know, it would be a tough life to when people do certain things to you.  But anyway, you've been praying.  But anyway, enough of that.  Anyway.  I think it's important.  I do think it's nice to offer a prayer instead of a phone call to the police. 
[00:57:30]  And I think when a kid is possibly being fucked in the ass, a phone call to the police.  No, a prayer.  No.  A bunch of years later, offer a prayer.  Yeah.  And then get back to telling them how great they've been.  Yeah.  That should end relationships and friendships.  Sorry.  Exactly.  Absolutely.  He sounds like, I forgot the guy's name from Family Guy.  With the whistle.  The pedophile on Family Guy.  What's his name on Family Guy?  Paul?  Herbert.  You know, with the word Herbert.  Is it Herbert? 
[00:58:00]  Well, that's what everyone's saying.  Okay.  He's got that whistle.  Yeah.  I'll continue because now the pep rally starts.  Love you, Joe.  Love you, Joe.  Whoa.  The guy that didn't do enough.  Let Joe stay.  Let Joe stay.  Let Joe stay.  Yeah.  Let him stay.  Don't call the cops.  Let Joe stay.  Let Joe stay.  Yeah.  He was basically telling everyone right there, he's done. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  He's fetished.  You think that was adios, au revoir?  Yeah.  What did he say there?  This was my life?  Or he was talking kind of in the...  I couldn't hear.  He had that...  Well, he's 84 years old.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So...  Oh, boy.  Yep.  Yeah, he's just...  Oh, the higher-ups at Penn State squashed the press conference.  All right.  Yeah.  I would assume they don't want him yapping about anything because anything he says will 
[00:59:00]  probably be used in any criminal proceedings.  God, we got the...  All right.  Let's go to Ron in Pittsburgh.  Ron.  Civil.  Ron.  Hey, guys.  Hey there, Ron.  Hey, uh...  Yeah.  A lot of people...  If you meet anyone who goes to Penn State, we call it the Penn State Syndrome.  You know, they go there and it's like their shit doesn't stink and they're the best place  in the world.  It's like the most annoying thing to ever experience if you ever meet a Penn State person.  You know what's... 
[00:59:30]  Oh, sorry.  You know what's weird?  It's like...  I understand people have pride in the school and it's got a great history.  That's some pride.  And I get that people have...  You know, it's been great for that whole area of Pennsylvania and, of course, it's an  important place.  But when you realize that the head coach didn't do what he should have done...  It's not like you...  When two staff members are fucking...  Or if you see like a...  Look, if it was an 18-year-old student blowing a coach and he went to the university president,  that's one thing.  Yeah.  But when you see a kid...  Well, Joe didn't see that. 
[01:00:00]  Or you hear about it...  Just to keep it back.  Okay, yeah, you're right.  You hear about that and you don't go to the cops.  You're a fuck.  I'm sorry.  You're a fuck.  I don't care why you didn't go to the cops.  You heard about it.  You should have went to the cops.  Or made sure the university president did.  Unless the university president said, we're going to the police and then lied to Joe Paterno,  then he's off the hook.  Yeah, it's a tough spot for a lot of people at Penn State.  Alumni, current students, faculty.  It's a tough spot.  I get it.  But Paterno absolutely should have done more. 
[01:00:30]  And this guy stayed with Penn State past his coaching years.  Well, yeah.  That's fucked up.  He must have loved it.  Thanks, Ronnie.  Ronnie, let's say hi to Brian in Philly.  Brian.  Hey, good morning.  Obi, Anthony, Jimmy.  Hey, buddy.  Yeah, according to philly.com, Joe Paterno actually did want to call the press conference  himself.  He's actually the one who contacted the press to say, hey, I want to say exactly what I  knew, who, you know, when I knew it, and which test I took. 
[01:01:00]  But the university hire, obviously, you know, all the way up to the president, got terrified  of what he was going to say.  So they, you know, they put the kibosh on that.  So as many people think that Joe Paterno has all the power at that university, that's a  very revealing...  They call him Joe Paterno.  I know.  They call him Joe Paterno.  Well, Brian, can I ask you this?  He wanted to say a lot, right?  You're saying that.  So why didn't he do it outside his home last night?  And that's why I'm not defending him, because he could have... 
[01:01:30]  There are other avenues.  He could have actually resigned and said whatever the hell he wanted.  But he...  You know why he didn't?  Because he cares more about his fucking legacy.  Exactly.  They also want to protect themselves against civil liability.  Yeah.  And if they say one thing that's wrong, then, you know, they could be brought up maybe even  on criminal charges.  Who the fuck knows?  Yeah, maybe, look, if he did stuff, and he did try to get the cops involved, and he thought 
[01:02:00]  they were involved, maybe he was misled, too.  I shouldn't say that he absolutely knew.  Maybe he didn't.  And maybe when they said don't call the press conference, the press conference isn't as  important if he actually did what he's supposed to do.  We got this guy.  There's a lot of these guys.  Vinny?  Go ahead, Vinny.  Vinny?  Hey, go ahead.  You're on the air.  I just call it to say that, although I think Joe Paterno should have done more, he actually  did report it to the university police chief. 
[01:02:30]  Okay.  You know, so he did go up the hierarchy.  And this allegation come, too, in 2002.  So actually, Sandusky wasn't an employee of Penn State University at the time the allegation  come forward.  So he did go to the police on campus?  He did go.  Okay.  That guy in charge was the police, the university police chief.  So he contacted the AD, the police chief, and he let them go through the due process. 
[01:03:00]  Me, as a person, morally, I would have called the state police.  You know what I mean?  But Joe Paterno went through the steps that I feel that he should have went through.  Joe Paterno.  Joe Paterno.  Well, look, if he did call the cops, I mean, campus cops, I think, have a pretty free range  compared to a lot.  Don't university police have a certain amount of range that regular cops don't even have?  Or no?  I think they can...  They're real cops.  They can walk into, like, dorm rooms and shit by just looking in a window and maybe seeing  something.  There's a lot of shenanigans. 
[01:03:30]  There's a lot of questions that got to be answered.  There's stories.  There's a lot to this one, man.  Yeah, I don't want to throw the guy under the bus if he fucking, if he actually did the  right stuff.  See, I just don't, I don't think, I mean, I think everybody's coming down too hard on  him.  Well, you know.  Someone here, TBO, is saying, if anyone says Joe Paterno, just assume they are overlooking  the ass rape.  Of course.  Of course they are.  Joe Paterno.  Of course they are.  Get out of here with your Joe Paterno.  Of course.  Yeah. 
[01:04:00]  I always thought it was Joe Paterno.  We would laugh.  What'd you...  Jerry and I...  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  Yeah.  I want to be Unkpa.  Unkpa.  Sure.  That's what my online name is.  Joe Pond Unkpa.  Yeah.  Unkpa 57 YRS Young.  Hey, Vinny, why was Sandusky allowed to continue, you know, to stay at Penn State doing other  things? 
[01:04:30]  Well, would that be Joe Paterno's place, or would that be the athletic director's place?  I don't know.  To be honest with you, I don't know.  I think if I was Joe Paterno, I'd be very uncomfortable knowing the guy was still around.  Right.  Knowing that I'm pretty much a god in these parts, and I know what the fuck happened in  the locker room.  Granted, he's not part of the football program anymore, but the guy's still around the campus.  That would make me very uncomfortable.  Yeah, I agree with you guys.  I mean, I'm just...  But he did report it.  You know, the university police, if it had happened, ain't it an obligation of a sworn 
[01:05:00]  police officer to report it?  Come on, passing the buck now.  More than it is a football club?  Yeah, I mean, look, if a cop knew, and the cop didn't do what he was supposed to do, but  I don't know what the cops did.  If Joe...  Did Joe ever see Sandusky after he was told that Sandusky was in the shower with a boy?  Did he ever see him face-to-face ever again?  I'm sure he did.  All right, then for him not saying, get the fuck out of my face, you disgusting man, 
[01:05:30]  is, I think, shirking his responsibility.  But maybe the guy denied it, and said, like, no, I can't believe he thought that.  And, you know, you don't want to believe that about somebody, so maybe he went to the cops  and the guy denied it, and it's like, okay, well, it hasn't been proven, so let's see  what happens, if they can prove that he did that.  I think if you're that close to the situation, and it's happened that many times, you know  what's real and what isn't real.  You get a vibe about things.  You just, without seeing things or hearing things, things are said, little rumor and 
[01:06:00]  innuendo, ballied about, I think you kind of figure out what's going on.  The guy coached for 31 years.  The guys that played football under the Sandusky cat has never said an inkling.  They are all shocked.  Yeah, they're adults.  They were too old, you idiot.  They were too fucking old for him.  He liked 10-year-olds.  10-year-old boys.  There was a 10-year-old in the shower, not an 11-year-old.  10?  That makes it bad.  Daniel, or Danielle in Jersey, go.  You're on with Vinny. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, Vinny, you are so wrong, it's not even funny.  First of all, Joe Paterno did not go to the police campus, or the campus of the police.  Okay, what he did was he went to Curly.  Because you know when you...  Oh, God.  Nah, nah, nah, nah.  Ah, looks like he's fucking 10-year-olds in the shower.  Hey, hey, Moe, hit him with a wrench before he penetrates that boy. 
[01:07:00]  Nah, nah.  Ah, why'd you use this hammer on the boy?  Hey, don't give him any ideas.  He's already screwed up their lives.  Nah, nah.  Woo-boop-boop-boop-boop.  Ah, come to Curly.  I'll help you.  Nah, nah.  For anyone that wants to discuss this seriously,  call Joe C.  Please don't say Curly.  When are you going to learn?  Woo-boop-boop-boop-boop-boop.  Just say Mr. C or something. 
[01:07:30]  By the way, we were wrong about the chant outside.  Somebody on Twitter has cleared it up.  They were not chanting Joe Baste.  They were chanting, Joe DeRosa's gay.  Oh.  Well, that's accurate, at least.  You must have saw the podcast.  Uh, Danielle.  Hey, Sandusky, get off that boy.  Moe's coming.  Speaking of Moe.  Yeah, give me a wrench or something.  Nah, nah.  We didn't hear...  Ah, shut up, Chip.  We didn't...  You're the fourth stouge.  We didn't hear past the, uh... 
[01:08:00]  Joe Paterno went to Mr. C.  So, continue.  Okay, listen.  I have to start by saying, oh, I love you guys.  Thank you.  And I only thought by satellite video just for you guys.  No one gives a shit.  I know it is a shame, because they're a horrible puppy.  But I love you guys.  All right.  But anyway, uh...  Joe Paterno did not go to campus.  Who did he go to?  Yeah, who did he go to?  He went to, uh...  To, uh...  Shemp.  He went to...  He went to Curly. 
[01:08:30]  I just told him not to say Curly.  Huh, what are you doing with that young boy?  Get that penis out of your mouth.  Hey, what are you doing?  Don't touch his testicles.  You're gonna give him a complex when he grows up.  Hey, I'm warning you.  Get your dick out of that boy's asshole.  Yeah, take your dick out of him.  For the love...  For the love of God, don't say that word.  Hey, you're making that boy gay. 
[01:09:00]  Danielle, it's important, though.  Joe Paterno didn't go to that guy.  He just went to that guy, not the campus police, you're saying?  That's exactly correct.  Wrong answer.  Read the newspaper, girl.  The fuck is Curly.  Hey, what's he doing?  He's giving that boy a Roman war helmet. 
[01:09:30]  Ah, knock it off.  I still got to see blood.  Oh, boy.  He's putting his balls and his penis in his mouth.  Wait till Mo gets a load of this one.  Why would you say his name if you want to discuss this seriously?  Yeah, it looks like they're hitting with wrenches and stuff.  Holy fuck.  Ah, Chip again. 
[01:10:00]  Hey, Chip, shut up.  Yeah, what's that?  Holy fuck.  All right, so Vinny's saying he did go to the campus police.  And Danielle's saying no, he went to that guy.  It's Vinny's a newspaper.  Two of them resigned.  One of them is, and the other was the head of campus police.  That's right.  All he had to do was report to the police.  You have your facts, Tom, Vinny.  But like, most of the people that are blinded by big bad jokes in Arno and big bad Penn State, right? 
[01:10:30]  You're not understanding that there's victims involved.  So if it was your son getting torqued by a big fat bastard, you're going to go and tell Curly?  Hey, what's he doing?  I think that's the 69 position.  Oh boy, I see blood going down the shower drain.  Oh boy, he's holding his head. 
[01:11:00]  I never saw that sexual position before.  Moe's done that to me plenty of times.  Oh my God.  Yeah.  What, are they going to hit with the wrenches and stuff, too?  Hey, Chip.  You put on a good show.  Thanks. 
[01:11:30]  All right, later.  Yeah.  Thank you, Vinny.  Thank you, Danielle.  All right.  We got Jay Moores.  Jay Moores.  Ladies.  Jay.  See what I did?  You guys are all guys, but I called you ladies.  Like, right away, break your balls or something.  What a hump.  Yeah.  How about Jay Moores, but not a lesser?  I don't know.  I fucked up.  Oh, you had it now.  Right now would be a really good time for Joe Paterno to go full old. 
[01:12:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Full old.  Just walk around with $16 and change in your pocket and go,  Nah, I'm an Easter egg.  I'm an Easter egg.  Hey, Jay.  It is amazing what that lady just said.  You're going to report it to Curly?  No.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Hey, I'm warning you.  That's because there was an 11th issue before.  That's because it's always behind me. 
[01:12:30]  So, uh...  I don't know why I just did Curly.  Hey, Jay, you know a lot about sports.  Way more than us.  What's your take on this whole fucking thing?  Death sentence.  Paterno's gone.  Well, you broke the news, Opie.  That's why I was calling is...  How many news stories does Opie have to break  before people stop breaking his balls about breaking news stories?  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know, man.  I'm on a good fucking roll right now.  Leave me the fucking line.  But in fairness, Jay knows more about sports,  but we know more about molesting.  Yeah.  And you know more about that. 
[01:13:00]  I tweeted last night a joke,  and people went fucking crazy.  Yeah, I saw you all over the blogs.  And then I deleted every tweet that I've ever done.  And then people are like,  Oh, we deleted his tweet.  He must be apologizing.  No.  I'm like, no, I deleted six months of tweets.  Oh, shit.  I delete tweets all the time  just to clean up the timeline.  You've got to clean it up every once in a while  because some people want to, like, you know,  spend some time on the timeline.  Jimmy will love the joke  because he hangs out with people that he can actually...  Like, Bob Levy and Vaughn, 
[01:13:30]  you could totally trick into this.  Right.  I said, when your friends ask you about Penn State,  see if you can trick them  into Google searching 10-year-old boy anal sex.  See, that's a funny line, man.  Why would you take that out?  That's a great joke.  Yeah, there's still humor in this fucking thing.  Also, some seriousness.  Because then I...  Well, it was the meltdown that ensued  of me calling everybody on Twitter lemmings  and why don't you stick...  I think my best line ever,  the one that's still up,  is why don't you stick to following?  Yeah, you described Twitter... 
[01:14:00]  You described Twitter last night perfectly as well.  This whole thing's just a fucking goof  and too many people just attack you  and get way too serious about it.  If there was no Twitter or no Facebook,  Jimmy and I's audiences  would be the exact same amount of full or empty  depending on what town we were in.  There's never been a club that Jimmy showed up at  and went,  Holy shit, Twitter's moving the fucking tickets.  I know, I've had a few...  I've had a few people, I think.  I don't think Twitter sells much.  No, I don't think so either, but... 
[01:14:30]  Maybe like two tables of people.  Jay.  Yes, sir?  Hi, sweetie.  Just keep me on track a little bit.  Paternal, though, man.  Should he have done more?  Are we wrong about this?  What's your take?  He should have gone to the police.  A fucking kid's getting...  It's not like, hey, I think it might happen.  Like, maybe it was inappropriate.  Like, a guy went to Joe  and his...  You know Joe always has that giant snot  in his nostril that doesn't know it's there? 
[01:15:00]  That fucking dry one,  that cornflake at the bottom of his...  Oh, God, that's disgusting.  Look, man...  It's true.  Joe was put in a tough spot,  but fuck, man.  It wasn't a tough spot.  If the kid's getting raped,  you have to go to the cops.  You don't tell the fucking AD.  I agree.  And that's what he should have,  but for some reason,  he felt like he was in a tough spot  and didn't want to do that,  wanted to do the bare minimum.  He thought he was in a tough...  Look, I'm a huge Penn State fan  because you have to go to fucking class. 
[01:15:30]  And that's why this hit...  It didn't hit me hard,  but that's why it hit my sensibilities hard.  Well, this was, like,  one of the few institutions  that you have to go to class.  Like, now we're left with, like,  Stanford, Notre Dame, and TCU  is the only place you actually have to be  a student athlete.  So for Joe Paterno to do the bare minimum,  that's criminal negligence.  Oh, I agree.  Wow.  I agree, man.  He's getting anally raped.  Hey, hey, hey, get in your shower. 
[01:16:00]  He's getting anally raped  by that coordinator there.  Oh, my God.  He doesn't even work here anymore.  Oh, my God.  That's fucking great, Norm.  Jesus Christ.  They let him keep an office on campus,  which was per his retirement package.  Like, it's so...  I mean, if you guys knew  that that was happening,  and the person kept their office down the hall...  I mean, granted, you got Roland.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have a guy on the mic next to me. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  Hey, always legal.  Sure.  Barely.  Barely, yes.  Barely.  But legal.  As Attell would say  on the anti-social tour,  nothing illicit.  Nothing illicit.  Illicit.  Illicit.  My David Attell, thank you.  Tell me to be a captain, yes.  Yeah.  And the guy was able to stay  at Penn State  with a lot of people knowing  what the fuck went down. 
[01:17:00]  That's crazy shit.  The AD,  they're going to do jail time.  Like, they're going to be  an example of the AD  and Curly  and these fucking guys.  Hey, why I ought to...  You ought to what?  I ought to use a condom.  Hey, I'm not built for prison, you know.  Gee, what do you have to...  What are you built for?  What do you have to say  to these hardcore Penn State people  that just don't want to see it this way?  Oh, I didn't even know  that they were that fucking ridiculous.  It's unbelievable.  I mean, you say this shit on Twitter, 
[01:17:30]  they come out of the woodwork  attacking you.  It's like...  Well, no, they came out on Twitter  saying that I'm in no position  to be making pedophile jokes  where it's obviously a joke  about tricking your dumb friends  to Google searching something  that'll get them in trouble.  Right.  And I explained...  I made the mistake  of actually explaining the joke  and then they started saying,  yeah, I don't know  what's creepier  than explain the joke guy.  Oh, shit.  He felt like he had to,  you idiots.  Because I don't want to be people 
[01:18:00]  thinking I'm making  fucking pedophile jokes.  Fucking...  Can you get...  Like, Voss would type that  into his fucking phone.  Let me see here.  Really?  It comes up on Penn State?  He would be the one  you trick, by the way,  out of all your friends.  You know, Voss,  you know about  Michael Jackson's doctor?  Type into your phone right now  how to kill a human being.  All right, give me a minute.  So Penn State fans  are indignant  that Joe Pott  did nothing wrong? 
[01:18:30]  A lot of them, yeah.  A lot of them.  They're fools.  Yeah, they're just blinded  by the passion  for the team and the man.  Yeah, you know.  What are you going to do?  Like Nazis with Hitler.  Jimmy, what words will...  Like, there's a block button,  but there's also like a block,  and if I knew this person,  I'd fucking bite their neck.  Like, what worse than...  Why don't you stick to comedy?  It's annoying,  but those people  are very easily bothered  by really slamming them back. 
[01:19:00]  I got into it last night  with a guy,  and I actually deleted  some of my tweets  after I was like too mean to him  because he was just mad  that I was doing it.  And it was just self-edit.  He was a cartoonist.  And it was self-editing  when I was dead.  I just didn't feel right about it.  I was like,  I was a little mean for no reason.  But yeah, I go after anyone who...  Or if I feel someone's being shitty,  they should be smashed.  Like, you want to attack me  in a public forum  when I'm not addressing you?  Like, if someone doesn't like  what you're tweeting,  just ignore it.  Like, I don't care if people block me  and don't... 
[01:19:30]  I don't care  if they choose not to read what I say.  That's perfectly fine.  It's not like I'm going to them  and going,  why didn't you retweet me  with an LOL?  Then they have an issue.  But if they feel that  I need to hear  how they didn't like the joke,  well, then I'm going to  fucking smash them.  And then...  But that's what sucks  when you smash them.  The people that really like you  and love you go,  hey, man,  I've done nothing but tell you  you're great.  Is that what I got to do  to get a retweet?  And then you're like,  is that what this is all about?  Fucking retweeting strangers?  Yep.  Yeah.  It's just fucking disgusting. 
[01:20:00]  Bunch of douchebags.  You bunch of queeps.  In order to get like...  In order to tweet something  that a few people get  and maybe the majority get it  and laugh along  or something like that,  you've got to deal with these idiots  that just don't understand.  And they just don't get it.  They're dummies.  That's why I just block.  Yeah.  You're a blocky machine, right?  Yes.  Blocking machine.  Blocking machine.  I don't think you block  as many as I do, though. 
[01:20:30]  No, I give some people  the benefit of the doubt.  I gave one guy  the benefit of the doubt  last night.  He fucking kept tweeting  the same thing to me  probably five times.  And it wasn't even something  I could respond to.  It was a statement.  And I'm just like,  I don't care what...  Shut...  And I reported him for spam  and blocked him.  That's the best.  I'm crazy.  Crazy like that.  What's the next breaking news  after Selena Gomez?  I got Selena Gomez pregnant. 
[01:21:00]  Pregnant.  I don't know.  Well, we'll have to sit on that  for a little bit.  You know, when you realize  that Twitter's not about  the numbers,  then it's so easy  just to fucking...  just go blocking everybody.  But the numbers mean nothing  unless you're over a million.  No, but for a while,  I think everyone looked at  your number like,  oh, I gotta get that number up.  And then when you realize  it's horse shit,  then you block as many people  as possible to keep it fun.  To keep it fun for yourself.  I mean this as a positive  towards Dane.  It's the Dane Cook syndrome  where like,  he really social networked 
[01:21:30]  the shit out of  getting people to come out.  But like,  he was the anomaly.  He was the one guy.  Like, no one's going to see  any, you know...  Jimmy, where's the next  anti-social thing?  It's January.  What a great plug.  January 15th.  Wow.  What happened there?  That's a fair question.  No, he went from  Dane Cook to you  without like a bridge.  Because he's saying,  well, we both do arrangements.  It's like hitting a plug pothole.  I think he just,  he's just driving along  and then bam, plug.  I think Jay Moore  just jumped the river  on a motorcycle. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, yeah.  There was no connection  between the Dane Cook  and the...  Right.  No, let me listen.  All right, go ahead, go ahead.  Thank you.  You're doing a new radio  for that, right?  This is my living.  January 15th.  It's going on.  It's the Sunday night  before Martin with the same birthday.  Second show going on sale.  Yeah, first one is totally sold out  with me, Artie,  Stanhope, and Attell.  And hopefully this one  will sell out too.  It's on 9 a.m. Friday.  What's that?  And you're going to do radio  for that, right?  Yeah, I mean,  just this show, I think.  I mean,  if anyone else wants me,  I'm sure I'll be available. 
[01:22:30]  Jay, where are you going to be, brother?  I don't fucking know.  Addison.  I saw that on your Twitter.  Addison is this week?  Yeah, I'm driving to  Shit Kicker Radio right now.  Are you doing more?  Oh, you're in the Dallas area.  I like that Addison improv.  Hey, that Trish Watkins  was in here last week.  Y'all know each other?  All right, Jay.  So, yeah,  Joe Pa's got to go 
[01:23:00]  because,  look,  and I love Joe Pa.  Joe Pa.  And I love Penn State.  I love Joe Pa.  I love my dead gay son.  But you have to report  to the police  and not your fucking manager.  If you're at fucking McDonald's  and someone's  ass-raping a child,  you don't go to  your fucking manager  and go,  Hey, uh,  I think there's kid raping.  You go to the cops.  Yeah.  So long, Penn State.  Wow.  Yep.  All right, Jay.  That's a bullseye. 
[01:23:30]  Ah, sugar!  What the fuck you do,  Joe Pa over there?  Ah, sugar.  Ah, sugar.  I don't feel that.  Do it a little harder,  Sandusky.  What the fuck you do over there?  All right there, Jay Moors.  Thanks a lot.  All right, Moore.  Keep me posted  on that breaking news, man.  It's amazing.  I got a good one coming up.  Thanks, Jay.  Later, sir.  All right, Jay Moore.  DM me that right now.  Jay Moore 37 on the Twitter.  Yeah.  Hey, one more thing  about Joe Pa.  Joe Pa.  Speaking of Twitter,  we got to thank  Mr. Coffee Says. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, yeah.  He just sent me  what he's calling  the greatest Joe Paterno  interview of all time.  I have not heard this before.  You got it there?  Yeah.  Listen to this fucking thing.  It's only two and a half minutes.  We are expecting  Coach Joe Paterno  at any moment. 
[01:24:30]  And, well,  how about that for timing?  We have the legend  who a long time ago  sat in my living room  recruiting my brother,  the head coach  of the Penn State University.  Hey, you're going to have  to speak up.  There's a lot of people  around you.  Well, we welcome you in, Coach.  And what I was saying  is that you sat  in my living room  recruiting my brother  a long time ago.  So I've been a Penn State  rooter for a long, long time  being from Philadelphia.  Yeah.  Can you hear me, Coach?  I can't hear a word you're saying. 
[01:25:00]  All right.  Well, uh...  Hang on just a second.  Okay.  Can't even get to...  I can't hear you.  Are you there?  I'm here.  Yes.  Okay.  Yeah, I mean,  I don't think I...  I'm screaming into the microphone  as it is now.  I mean...  And he's live on the air.  So, I mean,  I'm yelling at the top  of my lungs. 
[01:25:30]  So, I don't know  if the noise is too much there  that he can't hear me  or what.  I don't know.  No, we're in a pretty quiet area.  Okay, well, I'll try it again.  Yeah, let's...  Here we go.  Here we go.  Can you hear me, Martha?  Coach Paterno,  I can hear you great  and I don't know if...  Can you hear me?  I'm screaming  at the top of my lungs, Coach.  I can't talk any louder than this. 
[01:26:00]  I tell you,  I'm having trouble hearing you.  All right, well,  why don't we hand...  You know, what can I do?  I can't...  Can you hear me now?  No, he can't hear me.  I can't yell any louder.  I can't yell any louder.  We'll just have to let this go.  I'm sorry. 
[01:26:30]  We just can't do it.  I can't yell any louder than that.  I can't...  I literally was screaming.  Oh, well.  Can you hear me, Martha?  That's pretty funny, man.  Mr. Coffee says, I'm clear. 
[01:27:00]  Thank you, sir, for that.  All right.  What do we got?  Tom Papa coming in soon.  Is he here?  He will be probably by the time  we get back.  Champ-ampa.

[01:37:00]  I'm cutting my hand  Fuck  I'm a cook  I can't even peel potatoes  I'm a cook  Fuck  I run the motor pool  God damn flat fire again  Shit  Someone give me a ride to headquarters  Yeah yeah  Fire driving 12 year olds around  To headquarters  They suck  I just want to be a good warrior in the game  And I stink  Can you really do that  Can you really work at the fucking  In a motor pool  Uh no  No  It would be nice though  Nice and relaxing 
[01:37:30]  Give me 20 old man  Yeah  Trying to work the remote  I'm sucking ass  Doing push ups  Terrible  Yeah  I was drummed out of the service  Hanging with a wedgie  In the middle of Call of Duty  But you do this to yourself  I finally gave up  Because I wanted to play the hockey games  NHL  Yeah  I couldn't fucking figure anything out  I literally threw the game away  Because it made me feel good  We're being pushed out  We're just literally  You're being pushed out  You understand  How it's like to be crippled 
[01:38:00]  In real life  When you fucking try to play NHL  Oh it's so sad  And then my  Same fucking thing  I got nephews come over  And they're just  Like it's nothing  I know  What do you have in your hands  That I don't  One thing I know  I fucking  I rule in  Is aircraft  And battlefield  Yeah  If I play battlefield  And I got an aircraft  I'm fucking unstoppable  At least I got that  But  When the game starts  You have to run  And other people want these airplanes  But there's only a limited amount 
[01:38:30]  So  What always happens is  Right when you're ready to jump in your plane  Someone from your own team  Just rakes you in the back with a gun  And jumps in the plane  And then if you like  Shoot someone in the back  You jump in the plane  And then someone throws a grenade in front of it  The whole thing explodes  It's just a cavalcade of fucking team killing assholes  Trying to get one plane  If you get it off the ground  You're lucky  And then you turn around  And strafe the guys that were trying to kill you  So you're not even killing the enemy  You got way more patience than me  I'm down  That's fucking fun  I'm down to playing Tiger Woods Golf 
[01:39:00]  I used to be a big gamer  Tiger Woods Golf  That's the last game that I can play  Without the frustration level getting to me  Where I'll throw the game away  Because it's slow  You go at your own time  Yeah  You line it up  That's it  There's nice scenery  I used to have a pile of games like everyone else  I know  We're being pushed out  We're literally being pushed out  I tried Call of Duty  I fucking couldn't get shit done  I literally get nauseous  Fuck the Perkins waitress  Just fucking  Ah my thumb  Tiger Woods after a while  Is the most boring fucking thing to play 
[01:39:30]  Yeah cause it's golf  It's the same shit  It's golf  It's the same shit  The graphics suck  I know  But I kind of like golf in general  Here comes a putt  That's what I'm down to though  That's it  Here comes a putt  See  You're lining it up  It's getting ready to go  I am just a  I'm cannon fodder  I just can't fucking get  You're just neat  The hang of  And I can get the jump on someone  Really easy  Like I've walked up  Behind other players  And unloaded  And watched  Nothing hit the person  And then they turn around  And just 
[01:40:00]  Boom  I'm gone  And then  Motherfucker  Are you kidding me  I can't do it all  Clip  I am a little mag  Into you  Fuck  Whoa  It's horrible  Jeez man  I just can't do it  I'm upgrading some of my weapons  Like the further along in the game you get  You'll get to upgrade with better scopes  And better aiming  And stuff like that  But the position I'm in right now  Is just futile  I just  I got  You and a Swiss army knife  It pretty much is  It's a gun that really just moves around too much  And it's got no real sight on it 
[01:40:30]  No stability  Do you think there's any chance we'll get it  Back  Like we could get those skills back  Is there anything we can take  Maybe hand surgery  Or something  Like something with your brain  If I was some surgeon  I would figure that out for old men  It's not your hand  I'm telling you  It's not your hand  It's your brain  I'm squinting  I'm squinting  I'm missing a go  On the screen  I'm looking at the screen  Something that doesn't work in my hand anymore  Something in my hand  Yes  I'm telling you  That's what it is  I can't see god damn it  Don't say it's my brain  I don't want to hear that shit  It's your brain  It's all hard  It's hard  They have like flowing highways 
[01:41:00]  Of neurons and stuff  Our hearts are all like boarded up  A lot of fluid  And there are a lot of guys with cones  Orange cones  Yeah they're like the gushy sponge  And ours is like the one  That's in the car wash bucket  For a month  It's just kind of  It has dry areas  Real crunchy  Real heavy with rocks in it  Yeah yeah  Doesn't matter how much  Fucking fluid it's in  Yeah  Oh it doesn't work  Our brains don't work  And I do find myself  Like I'm squinting  At the fucking  It's a giant screen  And I'm squinting  Where's that gentleman  Where did that gentleman go 
[01:41:30]  I saw  I saw a gentleman walk in here  It's horrible  I literally have to tell myself  To blink in those games  Yeah yes  I'm trying so hard  My eyes are  They're getting all dried out  Wake up with like a headache  Just from the game  Never mind the booze  Here's what it is  It's while the kids are playing  They don't have a voice inside them  Going  You're playing a video game  Douchebag  No I don't mind that  Jimmy  Jimmy  Jimmy never got into video games  Of course I did  You minded  Yeah as a kid I did  I'm playing a game  With 12 year old children 
[01:42:00]  No I love playing these games  I just wish I was good at it  That's why you're not good at it  It would be cool  If I wasn't at the bottom of the list  Every time the game ends  I'm at the ultimate bottom  One maybe  It says one kill  One assist  15 deaths  That would fucking drive me nuts  Every single time  I'm at the bottom of the fucking list  Slight concussion from falling over  Yeah yeah  What's your game Tom?  From falling off the ladder  I like Madden  I like the sports games  Yeah I still do a little Madden  Is that the one where you drive around on a bus 
[01:42:30]  Because you're a chicken shit  To get on a plane?  You old grump  What are you living for?  What are you saving?  I like Madden because you literally don't  You can just  Old grump  Kick a play and just hang back  Right right  And it all happens  You feel like you're doing something  So you're watching a football game  And you're watching a cartoon football game  Nothing happening  Well the graphics are to the point  You think you are  Yeah I like playing Call of Duty  I put Platoon in  And just watch it  It's great  With a controller in your hand  Yeah with a controller in my hand  Look at me  I'm taking out Barnes 
[01:43:00]  I used to like the sports games  Like I said  I tried the fucking hockey  And didn't make that too complicated  For my stupid little brain  And then I tried the basketball one too  And instead of doing a jump shot  I'm passing the ball to the opponent  I'm like fuck this  Do you know how many times  I've tried to throw a grenade  Through a doorway  It hits the wall next to it  Bounces right next to me  And I blow myself up  I can't count the amount of times  I've done  Have people seen that?  Oh yeah  And that's what they got  He blew himself up  This fucking idiot  Dude  Did you see what he did?  He took the RPG 
[01:43:30]  Pointed it on his feet  And pulled the fucking trigger  I've done that too by the way  Do you dream about it after you play?  Like if you go right to bed?  Yeah I've done that before  But I always have like gun dreams  These are actually calm  Yeah  No I just wish I was better at  And I see  I don't know how it's done  I see people when  At the end of the game  Game's over  I'm on the bottom  One kill  One assist  Fifteen deaths  And there's somebody  At the top of the list  Thirty kills  Zero deaths  It's like  How did you walk around 
[01:44:00]  For the entire game  And not one motherfucker  Caught you from behind  Or just didn't see you?  Well I think the term  That you nailed it  When you said  How do you walk around?  You're walking around  They're crawling and diving  Maybe that's it  You're on a stroll  With your gun  I really am just kind of  While strolling  Through the battlefield  One day  In the  Fuck are you in me?  What's up man?  The worst 
[01:44:30]  Oh this is a nice pathway  And here's another thing  I always figure I'm safe  I got like  I'll see four of my own teammates  And I'm like  Cool I'm fucking sticking with them  Four of us  Running down the road  I'm crouched  They're crouched  We all go through the same doorway  One, two, three, four  I'm in  I turn  Bam I'm the one that gets killed  All three of them  Are just still walking around  You're a decoy  I'm always the one  That gets fucking nailed  Out of everybody  No matter how big the group is  Wait fellas  Wait  Hey guys  Wait up for me  You gotta tape this shit 
[01:45:00]  Oh I will  It's hilarious  You gotta tape these little kids  Abusing you online  I saw  And a camera trained on you  Physically  Yeah yeah  I'll do a split cam  You have to  It's too good  How do you  How do you look at the whole board  You can only see what's right in front of you  So how do you see what other people are doing  That's just it  You have to be nimble  Where you are constantly spinning your guy around  You got your gun up  You're spinning  You're looking around  When you go through a doorway  You gotta look at your corners  It's virtually  You need the controller 
[01:45:30]  To be an extension of your whole self  And your eyesight and everything  You can't for a second  Have to consciously go  I need to look left  Right  You need to be able to  Move with your fingers like  And move that character around  In fluid motions  I suck at that  I suck at the paintball game too  I'm terrible at those shooting things  Well that's kind of real life  But I mean even then  I'm terrible at it  Why?  I just am not good  Yeah?  Yeah I just panic  And I shoot the wrong way  You don't have the killer instinct  None  So Call of Duty 
[01:46:00]  You got the box in front of you  Yeah  I love it though  Did we talk about the Jonah Hill commercial?  Or was that off there?  Yesterday  Yeah we did talk about it  On air too  It really is a great commercial  Yeah it's pretty cool  It's cool right?  It's one of the coolest commercials I've seen in a long fucking time man  Yeah  Can you make it look like you on the game?  No I don't think so  Yeah I don't think they got that  How much do you control your character?  You don't actually see your character right?  Because you're seeing from your point of view 
[01:46:30]  Yeah you're in first person mode so  Do they have mirrors you can walk by?  I've seen games where they have mirrors  Can you go to the barber shop?  I've been in games where they like that  You're looking in the mirror  You jump up and down  Jumping up and down  And then someone stabs you  Because you're looking in the mirror  Like an idiot  Yeah  Doing your hair  Yeah  Are you trying to say  The 12 year olds don't look in the mirrors?  No they're not playing games  I did  They're acne ridden faces  Years ago  There was a game Half-Life  It was called Half-Life 
[01:47:00]  It was one of my favorite games  And I was playing a multiplayer on that  And I was good at that  Because it was on the computer  Again  And maybe I was younger  But I also knew how to tag the walls  You were able to put these  You could pick these options  Of these paint tags  And put different things  That they put in game  But you were also able to import  Your own stuff  And be able to spray that on the wall  What I used to do  Is get porno  And put it in the game  Where I would go  And it would be a porn picture  That would last probably five minutes  On these walls 
[01:47:30]  So I'd spray it  And then crawl under a stairway  And these kids  Would walk up  And just  You see their characters  Staring at it  Because on screen  They're able to look at it  And then you just come up  And rake them  As they're masturbating  It was one of the best  Fucking strategies  Or you just put  You put a satchel bomb  Right near the picture  And then when they stop  To look at it  You hit the button  And fucking blow them up  That's pretty good  It was great  They don't have that shit anymore  Though  It's a lot of fun  So basically you're trying 
[01:48:00]  To tell everyone  You need to cheat  I need a  That's not a cheat  That's a ploy  I improvised  Adapted  Overcame  Hoorah  Semper Fi  That's hardcore  Yeah  I love how you have  The box set  That these kids  Can't afford  I know  That's the one thing  I got them on  I'm rich  In the middle of it  You can just be like  So what do you guys  Think of the field manual  Field manual  You got the metal box  That it comes in  Yes I do  Smokey shot me  I'll take that 
[01:48:30]  You rich fuck  Do they want the field manual  You think  Oh they want it all  Believe me  Oh the kids want all this  Yeah  All the goodies  In the deluxe box  It's a hundred dollars  It's called the hardened edition  Damn  Look out  What are you going to do  With half that shit  Are you just going to  Throw half that shit away  Well yeah  Most of it is virtual though  It's in game stuff  You know  When you're walking  Let me tell you  When your character's  Strutting around those maps  And you're wearing  The exclusive 
[01:49:00]  Juggernaut outfit  That came with the  Hardened edition  Yes  That means you're badass  Oh yeah  Until you know  You get into the game  And get taken out  By a ten year old  With a knife  I'm a general  I got the game  You're not a general  If you could just  Stay in the office  Yeah I just want to  Stay in the office  And send young men  Out to die  Right  Like a real general  Can I just send  Young men to die  I'm going to  Stay right here  And look good  One time I had 
[01:49:30]  720 kills  And no deaths  No you didn't  Yes I did  No you didn't ship  You're lying  It's impossible  It's not  What do you get  At that point  Are you able to  Call in an airstrike  Yeah  Yeah  Because you could do that  And by the way  I've never been able  To call in one of these  Like if you get  Three kills in a row  Three kills  You call in an airstrike  Well you can  You can either launch  UAV which shows  Your team where the enemy is  You could get more kills  And launch a predator drone  Where you get an above view  Of the field  Yeah  And you could just 
[01:50:00]  Take out team members  You could get a C-130  With machine guns on the side  And just blow people away  With like five kills in a row  I never get anything  I get one kill in a row  And then I'm dead  How's the  What's the most in a row  Where you get like presents  Three  Presents  Like a predator drone  Yeah  Three kills will get you  The ability to have your team  See where the enemy is  How long can you be  In the predator drone for  Well until you drop a few bombs  Drop your bomb load  Kill some people  But they don't know 
[01:50:30]  You can see them right  No they know  You hear like an announcement  It goes  Enemy drone in the air  Enemy drone in the air  And then you try to run for cover  And you get blown up  So could you just hide  Under a doorway or something  Yeah you can hide  In buildings sometimes  But if you're too close  To windows and shit like that  You just get taken out  Will they see you  If you're in a building  Yeah sometimes  Why how  Because they got like  They got like infrared  And they could see through  Windows and shit like that  Yeah  It's a predator drone  It's the real deal  It's real stuff  It's crazy  This isn't a game 
[01:51:00]  No it's not really a game  It would be interesting  If you found out later on  That you were controlling  Real people  Jeez  Imagine  Like every war  Imagine  In the last ten years  They've just sent people out  With things in their head  I'm not saying  Electronic devices in their head  You know a chip  What's that?  And you're like  Kids are controlling them  They're just dying  Left and right  Who cares?  As they're playing  There's news reports  Out of Syria  Yeah  Predator drone attack  Alright  Why haven't they made 
[01:51:30]  That movie yet?  That sounds like  I would like if  In the middle of  Call of Duty  All of a sudden  Q-Bert just starts  Hopping across  Q-Bert  Jim's playing  Boing  Boing  Boing  Just unload on them  You got people  Talking  Sam in Connecticut  Let's go  Let's try to make this quick  Because a lot of people  Want to comment about  Call of Duty  Huge game  Modern Warfare 3  Now available  Go ahead Sam  What up Sam?  Yeah I gotta tell you  Anthony  I totally sympathize  With you  I have one of 
[01:52:00]  Call of Duty games  Whenever I play  Campaign mode  I actually have to  Hand the controllers  To my wife  To handle the  Hand-to-hand combat  Because for some reason  I keep getting killed  Every single time  And she's a few years  Older than me  And she looks like  A combination of  Threats, Parkinson's  And Downs  When she fights  The guy  But I guess it works  Yeah man  You gotta have that  Fucking  Chromazone or something  Is that it?  Something different  In your fucking head  You gotta let your broad  Do the fighting for you  That would be so embarrassing  How humiliating  That is embarrassing  And honey  I'd rather just suck  Yeah  Honey  Does she put popsicle sticks 
[01:52:30]  On your dick  When you can't get an erection  Sweetie  Could you please  Kill these people  Here are hurting me  I have a theory for you  Anthony  Are you the black soldier  Because those are always  The first ones to die  Right?  Oh Jesus  Oh boy  It's not a Star Trek episode  Yeah  Exactly  Alright  Oh my man  Sure  Oh brother  Thanks a little  Honey  They're coming after me  Yeah  Help me  I can't shoot these people  God damn it  Honey  You gotta grab the controller  I'm getting very injured  Did you adjust the sensitivity 
[01:53:00]  Of your controller  Stop  Alright  I figured  Stop it  Did you unplug your unit  Did you plug it back in  Did you hit the reset switch  Wait five minutes  And plug it back in  Does it work now  Yes  Flow chart man  I fucking  I adjusted the sensitivity  Over and over and over again  I need to adjust the sensitivity  On myself  I'm very sensitive  When I get killed  Do you drink before you play  I drink all the time  I 
[01:53:30]  Yeah  Drinks before he fucking  Puts his feet on the floor  He's a drunk soldier  I really am  He's a drunk private  Out in the field  That might be part of the problem  Fuck it  Alright  We might have found the problem  No it loosens me up a little bit  Sure  I get a little better  After a few drinks  Banging into walls  Kicking through doors  I know  He just explained it for us  He's drunk  Well that's  Nothing to do with the controller  After like  Two full of those ladders  And you can't get through a doorway  He bangs his head on a coffee table  Like William Holden 
[01:54:00]  The only character  To be hiccuping his way  Through the Call of Duty  After  After two Captain Morgans  I loosen up  And get a little good  But by the end of the third one  I'm really crashing in a wall  Throwing up behind tanks  Yeah  I was actually  Officially court-martialed  In the game  Drunk and disorderly  Hitting on the other soldiers  Yes  Don't ask  Don't tell  It was all over  Yeah  You hear the creepy old guy  Asking if I saw Biloxi Blues 
[01:54:30]  Snowy in Michigan  Snowy  How you guys doing  What's up man  He's got delusions  Of being Rambo  He's more like Rizzo  From MASH  Oh  What's that  Dude your phone crapped out  Your phone crapped out  Jimmy didn't hear that one  Jimmy didn't hear  What'd you say  Uh  Your phone crapped out  Sure did  Thank you guys  On the show man  Thank you sir  Thank you bro  Thank you sir  Alright  Everyone's calling in 
[01:55:00]  Why does that guy  Have a giant canteen  Glug glug glug  I was getting pretty good  With the Barrett  Though  The Barrett  50 caliber sniper rifle  I was getting pretty good  With that in game  I was getting  Kind of walk around  A little bit  And then you stop  For a second  Survey the area  And then you gotta  Pull up the scope  But the bad part is  The scope is very shaky  And then you gotta  Hold a button down  And you hear like  Will you take that breath  And then it steadies the scope 
[01:55:30]  But you can't hold that for long  So you really gotta time it  Where you see the enemy  Know you can push the thing down  And then a lot of times  I just watch him  Run in front of my scope  Now my scope goes crazy  Because I exhaled hard  And I get shot in the back  I just love how  Motherfucker shit  I had him  I love we figure this out  He's drunk  Is it that I'm just intoxicated  Is he drunk  Yes  Should I try and sober  He can't walk a straight line  I don't know 
[01:56:00]  Because the big tell was  You can't get through a doorway  Yeah right  He's doing  He's talking about  All drunk behaviors  Right  Pulling off ladders  Right  You can't get through a doorway  You can't get through the door  You're ready to tour Johnson  Maybe that's it  A man of his intoxication  Would run into  The side of a doorway  Fuck man  Sitting in an easy chair  Smoking a pipe  You just sold a lot of games  It's a lot of fun  I think I might want to  Try this fucking thing  One more time  I've gotten all of them  It's a lot of fun  I'm welcome to this  Tiger Woods bullshit  I really do dig it 
[01:56:30]  It would be good  I mean because that's how  They actually test  You know on TV shows  They'll have people  Play a video game  And then feed them drinks  And see how it affects you  Right  Yep  Maybe  Maybe  But you would probably  Have a fine line  Like if you're straight  You're probably shaky  But if you're drunk  You're shaky  So it's like somewhere  That like one and a half  Drink  There's a quick peak  If you graft it  Right  It would be like  Horrid, horrid  Whoa, good  Bad  Horrid  Like really quick  You can play a ten minute game  Yeah, the game's too long 
[01:57:00]  For ten minutes  For ten minutes  He's kicking ass  Unbelievable  He's the king  Un-fucking-believable  Five minutes  Not so much  I will throw it on video  And I'll do it  From totally sober  To many drinks  And see if the fall off is there  Yeah, I think I ought to do that  After a couple drinks  It's like bumping shoulders  With the enemy  Yeah  Hey, what the fuck you do  Oh, shit, it's you  Listen, Tom Pop  Also a great star  We're going to take a quick break  Because Andy Dick's  Going to be here

Sirius XM  You're listening to Opie and Anthony  Loading a musket  I know I'm the worst  Hi everybody  Opie and Anthony program  We're back, huh?  Oh, here we are 
[01:59:00]  I guess I hope he's making  Some wee-wee  Oh  He had to drop a deuce before  Oh, did he?  Cheapers  You know what happens?  Sometimes you go into that bathroom  With all intentions  Of just taking a leak  And then just seeing  The bathroom  And the smells  And everything  Get your dick hard  You gotta stay  Crank one out  Well, I was thinking  Something else  Sometimes you gotta  Take a dump  Especially when it's  Nice and fresh  This early in the morning  It hasn't been polluted yet  That's true  It almost feels like  It's your own spot  Your bathroom is so polluted  You can't even  Take a fucking dump 
[01:59:30]  That bathroom has been  In the past though  It's been like  A fucking war zone  It's like an airport bathroom  At the end of the day  Terrible  Yeah  I don't know what it is  With some people  It's just  What is it to go to the bathroom  I know  And then wipe  Put the paper in  And flush  Yeah  It's like  How does it get  All over the place?  It's literally  Because when you go in  You never see people  Literally peeing all over the floor  No  The floor is filled with urine  Yeah you'd hear that  Wouldn't you?  It's so awful 
[02:00:00]  It's like a fucking  One of those aliens  Burst through someone's intestine  In the bathroom  That's what the walls look like  At some point  There's blood and guts  And shit  Everything's sticky  It's like a rainforest  It makes no sense  It's going to motivate people  To do that in a bath  Like I'm clean  Why would you put shit on the walls?  I mean maybe it's fun  Is it fun to just  Don't knock it till you try it to me  You're killing your own shit  Like an ape  I imagine  It could be fun  I've got to be with you  On that one  The worst 
[02:00:30]  Maybe it is  I guess Andy Dick  Is coming in  Yes  Today  I hear he's only here  For like 20 minutes or so  Oh okay  What's he doing?  Do we know what he's doing?

No he's been very cute  It's a boring dog  It doesn't do anything  But that's good  It's cute  It just sits there  Is it sick?  No  It does look sick 
[02:06:00]  It's got a very runny face  It does right?  It's all faces wet  They always do  Those dogs  It's healthy when they're all leaky  Kenny  Leaky  Why were you pushing your face up against the glass  And decide not to do what you were going to do?  I almost was going to comment about something  Oh  About what?  What were we talking about?

[02:08:00]  And it's  She was friendly  Friendly  That's all he wanted to  She has a boyfriend right?

You're an abomination to man  Do we have an Andy Dick update?  I wonder if she's going to be friendly when she sees you stomping on this poor dog  Bloody furry shoes  Sam 
[02:08:30]  Whoops  Emails and phone calls haven't immediately been responded to from the dick party  We're done  Cancelled?

Come on it's got to be funny  I know who needs a Y  Bill Tetley  He's just the worst 
[02:09:00]  Everybody's laughing on the inside  He's just the worst  That was the most silence I've heard on the show ever  That was really just utter  Like we were all taken aback by that  It was like a nuclear bomb  You know it was a good one  It was  Eric can we hear that again please?

[02:11:30]  Wow  Wow  What do you do?  I don't want to brag  But I came early  Yes you did  Did my stretches  Andy Dick one sheet  Don't you know he's outrageous?  He's crazy  You can't stop him  You can't hold him down  To your schedules  And your times  Crazy  Man  What's time?  What's time anyway?  Well I can't do this unless Sam's around  But now Sam's on Andy Dick duty or something?  I don't fucking know  Roland should be  Yeah  Like who cares?  Just get fucking Sam in here 
[02:12:00]  That's self boy  Get on the cane train  Are we getting  What's going on?  Two blocks away  Too bad  What?  I thought he got a hard out at 20  Or at 9 o'clock  Two blocks away means at least another 10 to 15 minutes  Fake hard out  What happened to the fake hard out?  What happened to the hard out at 9?  Yeah  I guess the schedule is just being moved around a little bit  That's how he rolls  Yeah  Not our schedule  We'll still have that valuable 20 minutes we needed from Andy Dick today  Cool 
[02:12:30]  Oh boy  Something to get the gossip columns talking again  Great  Maybe we just cancel then  All aboard the cane train  Two blocks away doesn't mean two blocks away  Oh thank you  Ooh that V8 looks like a good one  Yeah yeah  I wonder why it tastes metallic when it comes in a titanium tube  You're right  It's got a metallic taste to it  What do you think?  Cancel? 
[02:13:00]  This metallic  Can we tell them to cancel?  It's going to be after  Tell them to go home  We've got shit to do  We've got a radio show  Yeah  We've got to play a game  Oh that's much better  We've got to talk about Sam's mom  Yeah let's talk about his mom  Cancel and talk about the mom  Travis tell Roland to I think cancel  I mean it's to be 25 minutes late  Yeah blow it off  It's crazy  We don't need Andy Dick  We would do that for like fucking Mel Gibson  Yes  Travis?  We'd do that for Mel Gibson  No Andy Dick  We're canceling him  Five minutes ago  We don't care 
[02:13:30]  He was two blocks away  We don't care  Uh huh  No  So he's got to be less than two blocks away  We had something planned for 9 o'clock  Make Roland do something very uncomfortable  Like don't tell him this until Andy gets here  Right  Okay  Make him do something real uncomfortable  I'll tell you why I want to talk to him  Because I heard he's sober now  And he's like  Bullshit  I don't know if it's bullshit  But I'm just telling you what I heard  I don't think it'll be a problem  I was just thinking  Because technically he's going to be on time  For the rest of his interviews  He said he's  He's been saying he's sober for fucking years  We're helping him out  We're making him on time 
[02:14:00]  For all of his other engagements  Yeah  That's all Roland  Right?  Yeah cancel  I just like the idea of  Fucking over Roland  That's what I like  Making him sweat more than normal  Yes  Oh that sweaty mess  He's such a wild boar  We can put him on  I don't get  You know whatever  You gotta be  You gotta make a decision  You gotta go hardcore  You gotta go one way or the other  Yeah one way  We already went  Can we call Roland?  Is he downstairs?  Too late  He's actually in the lobby upstairs  If it was like five minutes  That'd be fine  I don't care 
[02:14:30]  Yeah  I don't care one way or the other  I'd just rather do fucking fun radio and shit  Yeah  That we have been doing  I've been having fun today  Let's talk about something else  Yeah  Your mother  The cane train  Yeah what's with your mother?  Why do I keep saying his mother?  Let me explain  We gave Sam's mom  The opportunity to be the official baker  Of the Opie and Anthony  Oh  And we're also  We're gonna take her under our wings  Right  And have her take out Martha Stewart  Oh wow  We had a whole plan for this lady  This is great  And she let us down  What do you mean?  Why wouldn't she take advantage of that opportunity?  She allowed Paul 
[02:15:00]  Yeah  Paul's mom  To bake us the key lime pie  Yeah  And then Sam says it was shit  What?  The key lime  Yeah  I mean  When you come in here with key limes  That are out of season  And pie crust  That are store bought  It's not exactly a baking competition  Is it?  Oh shit  You know what I mean?  But your mom is  Wait  Why don't I come in here with some Twinkies  And say look what I made  Hold on  Alright  You know  Hold on  The Sam thing  Might have to wait  Roland  Hello?  Hello?  Yes 
[02:15:30]  Where's Andy Dick?  Hello?  Yes  Where's Andy Dick?  What's up?  Oh  What's up guys?  What are you stretching?  No  And I don't mean like physically  Where is he?  He gave me a dick in the ass  What?  Oh brother  He gave me a dick in the ass  He's a block away from me  There are two blocks  They've been saying that for a while  We're canceling  Yeah  No more Andy Dick  Have some pride  No Andy Dick  Have some pride men  We never cancel guests like that  But this show is  You can't be over 25 minutes late to this show 
[02:16:00]  It's just not  Mel Gibson could be  He can't  Done  Done  Tell him turn around  1992  Yeah he's got other interviews  Let him do his other interviews  It's fine  Yeah if he's got other shit  He could do that  We're busy  We're on our schedule  One more thing  Yeah  What?  He's hanging up on us  He's gonna pay for that I think  How is he paying for it?  Yeah he knows  Well he hung up  He got Ant just now  Oh  He got me  I thought he meant it from the other side  I don't care  Good he got me  If he hangs up  The sooner he could call fucking Andy Dick 
[02:16:30]  And tell him  He's turning his fucking ass around  So wait your mom made the bad key lime pie?  No no no no no  Paul's mom  But she refused to even try  So we took the title away from her  She's not the official baker of the Opie and Anthony show  And we're not interested in having her try to take out Martha Stewart anymore  You're actually skipping a step  What's the step?  Well the step is that she baits you stuff  And then instead of saying  Oh this is great  You called her up  You asked her about her pubic hair  And played sound effects 
[02:17:00]  With the word cunt  I don't remember that  Oh  So that's where that came from  It wasn't so much just like  That's  I don't feel like doing this  Look who's here  Oh look who's here  Roland  Roland  Yes  How are you today?  Good  Listen to the Chris Martin interview  Pretty good  Yeah  Cool  So what's  What happened  With the 20 to 9  The 840 visit from Andy Dick  Which was supposed to be 820 by the way  Block away for an hour 
[02:17:30]  Officially it was 820  And then it moved 840  He literally just got in  His pubic is what  Nobody was picking up the phone  Well  We have our schedule  I said that  We wait for you for a half hour  The window is closed now  Yeah  We're on to key lime pie  Yeah  Ooh where?  Oh  Key lime pie  That would be nice right?  What was that pie that you were showing me in the box?  Oh pumpkin pie  But he's not here  In a box  He just got here  Well  So now where's he at though?  I think he's like  The other stations don't want him  So they're figuring out 
[02:18:00]  The other stations don't want him?  Really?  Why don't they want him?  Because Larry Flick had  Well Larry Flick did late too  Because it was  He screwed up everybody's schedule  Good  Way to go  That's how he operates by the way  It's always late and wacky  And expects people to just fucking kowtow  To his whimsy  I love that  I love that  Next time you want to play kowtow to your whimsy  Mr. Marshall  So I think he's going to do broad minded  And maybe another show  He's going to try to figure it out  That fits  That's cool  People are just like  Fuck him  Yeah  Good  Wow  That's it  Radio's a cutthroat business 
[02:18:30]  It's crazy  It's crazy  I think just for him  It's just  A lot of guys we'd wait for  Yeah of course  Of course  We don't need that  Any dick gets on your fucking skin  We don't need that shit  I agree with you  He dicked you guys  Fuck him  I have to sit in the seat all the way  No come back  I know  Come back  I gave him the good seat  You know what we apologize  No it's okay  We're moving you  Come back  It's not the same without you here  I kind of like it  He wants to sit away from Jimmy's asshole  Just fucking  It's very symmetrical right now  I like it  On the fart side of Jimmy 
[02:19:00]  Yeah  Downwind from Jimmy  So I don't know why Sam is bringing up those details  That's not really important here  What putting  Making remarks about someone's mom's pubic hair  His mom  And calling her  I mean you called her  Well not really  The C word  No the machine did  Oh really  No the machine did  Yeah but who pushed the machine  I didn't  This is after she made the shitty pie or before  She didn't make the shitty pie  That was the  Paul  Shitty pie  Paul  Okay  His shitty mom made the shitty pie  Alright  And then  Wow  True 
[02:19:30]  And then  So why'd the other mom get called the C word  Because  She is  No Sam's mom  Thinks it's funny  We haven't done anything  We haven't done any of this to Paul's mom  Because you know  She's doing right by us  She's busy baking  Yeah  Yeah  And by the way  I don't know  You don't know this  But this is a  Swear to God  True fact  I'm glad you brought this up  Today  It's my mother's birthday today  Oh  So it's nice  Let's get her on the phone  Let's get her on the phone  Fuck her  It's my birthday

[02:20:30]  Wow  Fucking Roland  Radio  The top of the pinnacle  Top of the pinnacle  I'll go  I'm gonna do it mom  I'm gonna do them proud  Oh god  Now it's just fuck  All bitter  My happy place is raped and burnt  It's gone  Just a river of blood  I came in this morning  He was eating pumpkin pie  Out of a box  Out of like a FedEx box  He said you want some pie?  Holy shit  What's that about?  That's where my life has turned to it 
[02:21:00]  Did mommy bake you a pie?  No the Discovery Channel send pumpkin pie  Why?  Oh because they're doing pumpkin chunking  Some pumpkin thing  They mailed you a fucking pie and you ate it?  Out of a box  Well I just  How do you eat a pie that's mailed?  It's safe  They put like a little  What is this?  1,800?  I think they were able to refrigerate things Jimmy  No but it would fall over and throw in a box  It's heavily salted  Yeah I think that's salted  I needed some salt pork and some pumpkin pie  Well at this point we should bring in Paul 
[02:21:30]  Sam  Hey there Paul  Is Paul here?  Yeah he's there  Painty Cheddar up  It's your mom's birthday  You sure you don't want to get the mom?  We got the mom on the line  Oh  Jesus Christ  We got the mom on the line  Happy  Well not yet  We got Paul first  Where's Paul?  I hit Siri by mistake while we're talking  Like I didn't mean to hit it  And it opened up to Kenny  And it says  Okay puddle under the dilemma  Alleges I'm proud  Gotten out of  It was listening to you talking  To us talk  And it was picking those words up  That's fucked up 
[02:22:00]  Wow  That's some kind of code  Yeah  Damn  Oh look at this  Paul has brought more baked goods from his mom  Oh shit  That's what this is about  Holy cow  Oh my god  Wow look at that Tupperware  That's high tech Tupperware  This is too  Look at Sam looking at the fucking  Oh my god  Look you're pissed off Sam  This is twice that his mom's done this  Wow that looks good  And what are we looking at?  Homemade crusts  Homemade crusts  I probably shouldn't  Key lime  But you know  Key lime bars they're called 
[02:22:30]  They're basically the same  They're just slightly different  Look at this so delicious looking Sam  And how fresh are the key limes?  Oh she just flew them in from Florida  She flew them in Sam  She didn't fly them in  She flew the fucking key limes  She wasn't in the cockpit  Right  There's real key limes in this  Wow  How good is it?  Ridiculous right?  Dude  Also Sam your mom is so done  If it's a crust  She doesn't even have a chance  To come back from this  A crust is something  You can pick up  You're poo pooing it now 
[02:23:00]  Well Paul's mom doesn't know  How to make a crust  Did you taste the key lime bars?  No I'm not going to taste it  With the fresh key lime  A key lime bar?  I'm not going to taste the key lime  Look at Jimmy  He can't get enough  This is a good crust  Look at Tom Papa  He can't get enough of this  It's a really good crust  So pick it up by the crust  Roland have a birthday treat  You don't have to pick it up by the crust  You can eat it with a fork  Roland put one finger on the crust  And it fell apart  Who cares?  It might as well be  He's eating it with a fork  If Roland put his finger  If Roland put his finger on anything  It would fall apart 
[02:23:30]  Give the doggy some  Give it a little to the dog  Hey can I have one too there?  See if the doggy likes it  So Paul what are we looking at?  Everything is fresh  And homemade right?  The presentation is just awful  And because my mother is such a very considerate lady  And knows that Anthony doesn't usually partake  She brought him fresh key limes for his booze  I have two key limes  I'm going to use in my Captain and Cokes  Jimmy's eating rice  Jimmy went for seconds  A second  But that says a lot 
[02:24:00]  Yes  That says a lot  No it doesn't  Oh you have one?  You like baked goods  Yes I do  You love treats  I do  I'll bring you one pal  Oh  Paul can I one  Lift it carefully  Because they're falling apart  You can tell she's a real baker  Just from this Tupperware  It's a cupcake  It's all natural pal  Dog food  Thank you sir  Wow it's really good  It's delicious mystery appetizer  Wow look at the little  I feel like I'm in Key West  Look at the little slice of key lime  On every individual bar  Amazing huh? 
[02:24:30]  You have a tiny little  Sam your mom is yesterday's news  Yeah  Where is one?  Yesterday's news  I never have this  Whoa  Yesterday's news  Wow you're going to go for one in?  I'm going to grab one  Wow they're so good  I don't know how you can  Alright thank you  This is going to hurt  Because it's your mom's birthday  Wow  This is going to hurt  Should we do this tomorrow?  You know it's  Let her have her day  Can you imagine  This is going to leave  Fucking scars  You know that  Emotional scars  Can you imagine how shitty  Her own birthday cake must be?  Exactly  Oh my god  Oh my god Sam 
[02:25:00]  She doesn't make her own birthday cake  You can say whatever you want  That's insane  What is your mom baking  A septic tank?  This stuff is amazing  Bobby  This is pretty god damn good  Yeah  Bobby  Bobby  Hello  Alright before it gets ugly  Happy birthday  Happy birthday Bobby  Happy birthday  Sam's mom  Thank you for the good wishes  And by the way  We bumped Andy Dick  To have you on the phone today  And that is the truth  Because we thought  This would be much better radio  So don't disappoint 
[02:25:30]  You guys have been boring me  Whoa  No why?  No Tom  You don't understand why  Why?  Because Anne's got a mouthful  I'll explain  Okay  Because her little boy Sam  Hasn't been on the radio much today  Oh  I was just on the radio  That's the only reason  No the only reason  That we're boring her  Yes  You're boring her  If she doesn't hear Sam's voice  She gets bored immediately  Sam's too busy  Bad-mouthing Tina Fey  He's too busy  Bad-mouthing Tina Fey  Why would he bad-mouth Tina Fey?  Why?  I don't know  It seems to be a career suicide 
[02:26:00]  I wouldn't bad-mouth Tina Fey  It would upset Mother too much  Mother loves Tina Fey  And says don't bad-mouth her  Because someday  Tina Fey will probably do something  For her little boy  So she really doesn't want him  Bashing Tina Fey  What do you think Tina Fey does?  Talent implants?  What can Tina Fey do for Sam?  Miss Roberts  We know you love Sam  But let's be honest  This is as good as it  Oh my  A second one from Anthony  Anne's going for another one  That's unheard of  I never  Unheard of  We're all going for second Sam  It's so god damn good  We're all going for second 
[02:26:30]  Unheard of  Sam's mom Bobby  It's called Key Lime Bars  With fresh slices of key  Why would you call it a bar?  It's not a bar  It's falling apart  You can't drink in it  Right Sammy?  Exactly  The presentation is amazing Bobby  Amazing  Mom  It's amazing  Mom  The presentation is horrible  It's on the same tray  That they brought in last time  All the things are smushed together  And you can't even hold them up  They're in cupcake foils  So if shit was on a silver platter  It would be good?  At least it would be a good presentation 
[02:27:00]  Oh stop  You know what Anne?  In all fairness that's fine  Where's Bobby's baked goods?  She's not bringing any to your ass  Oh that's right  I don't care about presentation  Because it's going to wind up going in  And coming out a lump of shit  There you go  I don't care what it looks like  It tastes good  There you go  Presentation is half of it  It's not half of it  Any decent baker knows  It's 1% of it  It's 1% of it  It's 1% of it  Oh is that good?  So good  I'm really sorry you had to hear this today  But this is really good stuff  Once again  Bobby what kind of cake are you going to have for your birthday?  You know tea lime bars are not tea lime pie 
[02:27:30]  That's right  They're better  Who cares?  Yeah they're in the room though  It's delicious  Mom you  I'm glad Paul's mother seems to have improved her baking since the last time  You see that's a little shot at Paul's mom  Yeah but we like the last batch too  Yeah but that's because you're easy to please  She's not really  She's just consistent  I'm easy to please  Are you  That doesn't seem to be true  How are you smoking?  I wish I was easy to please  Very easy to please  When it comes to baked goods  You can just throw whatever shit in front of you 
[02:28:00]  And you're like delicious  I don't like the fact that it's Bobby's birthday  And she's already being given stress and tension  I don't want to do that Bobby  I just want to say happy birthday  Thank you  I really that's very very nice  Yeah I don't think she deserves this on her birthday  That's true  Yeah  See look at that  What are we doing to her?  Nothing  Just rubbing it in her face  We're giving her a wake up call  You just don't want that  God damn rich cunt  You just don't want that  Who played that?  I don't know  My hands are in front of me Sam  I don't know 
[02:28:30]  I didn't see your hands  I saw Anthony say something nice  What?  Yeah I'm trying to just you know be nice that's all  And for once  One of you did  Yeah  Can I just say it's really really nice of Paul's mom  To send things in to make you guys happy?  Yeah why aren't you doing this anymore?  What happened?  You know like I'm saving up  Oh really?  She's just being  I don't want to spoil you guys  Oh man  Can you guys practice up on what Paul's bringing in?  Tough love  Yeah  She's giving us tough love  Yeah 
[02:29:00]  My stuff  She doesn't have a huge interest in pleasing you anymore  That's the problem  Who cares  We got Paul's mom  Well I mean  If Paul's mom was out of the picture  Then I'd be concerned  Why doesn't she want to please us?  Yeah  Well you Tom Papa  She would probably still please  Because you haven't said anything nasty yet  I haven't said anything nasty  I don't care about this  What are you doing for your birthday?  I'm just going to take it easy today  Oh that's nice  Are you getting presents?  I don't know 
[02:29:30]  What do you want to get?  What do you want for your birthday?  You know what?  I have almost everything I could possibly want  Goddamn rich cunt  You walked into that one  Sam let the record show  My hands are in the air  I wasn't looking  I was wondering what you were doing  I didn't get to be on  DLP and Anthony's show  Aw  So that's sweet  Sorry to throw  Too bad we can't give you some of this key lime pie  Bobby I'm extremely disappointed in you 
[02:30:00]  Oh that makes me feel really bad  Oh not on our birthday  Come on  We gave you a fine position on the show  A lot of people begging for positions on the show  Are they?  And you  Yeah  Yeah  They are  And you squandered it  I mean Martha Stewart  Too much position on the show  I have to bake  Bake  Well yeah  Yeah  Hey what about dinner tonight?  Are you going to be taken out to dinner?  Are you going out to a nice meal at least?  No we're waiting until the weekend for the celebration  Oh what are you doing this weekend? 
[02:30:30]  We're going to go out  And all the kids are going to come and stuff  Oh wow  Do you know where you're going?  Not for sure no  Is it a  You want to go to a fancy place?  No I'd rather like go to  I'd rather go like to  You know a pizza place or something  Really?  Oh look  Stress factory?  Look who's learning  Look who's learning  Look who's learning  She's a learner  Oh wow  You got a learner on the phone  You know what it is? 
[02:31:00]  A lot of people don't like to show off how much they have  That is true  Is that it?  You don't want to you know  Show off and be a braggart about what you have?  The cards you've been dealt in life  The wonderful family  You still got to worry about paying your bills and all right?  Do you?  Yeah  Uh huh  Yeah  I don't think so  I think that Robert's money is rolling in  Especially from Sam  Don't make any reference to being a rich person  That's what's being looked for here  Why do you want? 
[02:31:30]  Is that the trigger?  It's his birthday gift to his mom  A sound effect that coincides with you  Making any mention of having personal wealth  So  You should probably avoid that mom  Like you're avoiding baking for the Opie and Anthony show  That's terrible  I mean it really does seem like a great opportunity  Like if I were to be a baker  And then you'd have the Martha Stewart connection  It just seems like  You would do everything you could  Sam be quiet  Let Tom be reasonable  Well the thing is  No really  He's seen it correctly 
[02:32:00]  She doesn't need you for the Martha Stewart impression  Uh uh uh uh connection  Because I'm in  With Jennifer Hutt  Who's actually on  Oh  Martha Stewart's channel  Jennifer Hutt?  Jennifer  God damn which  Yes that's what you know her as  But who is she?  Well she does  The whatever show  You've had her in studio  We've met her?  I mean you talked to her for an hour  Oh  She was great  She was great  But I was over at my mom's house last night 
[02:32:30]  And she brought out a freshly baked cheesecake  For everyone to enjoy  Well  I don't see  We didn't get any  Exactly that's what I'm getting at  Was it runny?  It wasn't runny  Probably runny right Tom?  Yeah probably  It tastes like that old cheese  Like Roquefort  Yeah  Like Limburger  Limburger cheesecake  Where did she hide the Sarah Lee box?  She doesn't even know who Sarah Lee is  Yeah let me go through your garbage  I'll find a Sarah Lee box  Yeah or Costco  Cheesecake box  Kirkland brand 
[02:33:00]  Roland's  Male pumpkin pie box  I love the most bizarre thing  I come into the office  Do you want some pumpkin pie?  I expect to see like a nice baked pie  Like on a windowsill  He just reaches into a cardboard box  Oh my god  And there's like a bag in there  He's like  No there's pie in here  It's this pie  Does he have any left over?  I gotta see what this looks like  It's the holidays  Yeah I'm sure he does  He should bring it in  Paul's mom continues to be the official baker of the ONA show  Unfortunately  Not only is she not a great baker 
[02:33:30]  She obviously lacks personality  Since she can provide nothing on the air  The way my mom has done  We're just too busy baking and doing it  Yeah we don't all the time  We don't need her on the air  Don't you get it?  We just need her food  We need to get anything  We need to rattle in those pots and pans in the kitchen  The baking speaks for itself  I had two of those  Ann had two  Jimmy had two  Papa  Two  One  One so far  I'm trying to stay in shape  That means that's a success  I had seven slices of cheesecake last night  Seven  Ugh  Ow  That's right  We're going to have a weird dump today 
[02:34:00]  Yeah that's good  Wow  I wouldn't be bragging about that  It's going to be very toothpaste-y  It was just  It's going to be a Play-Doh factory through the weekend  About the worst day  Where does this one end?  Just cut off at your own discretion  Finish it later  I'll bet it's a shit without a tail  I really do need that taper  When you get that tail  You know you're done  Sometimes it's worth it  No exclamation point at the end of that one  We got Mad Dog Chris Russo on the line 
[02:34:30]  Hold on there Bobby  Mad Dog  Hey I want to do a comparison  To develop a lot of two pies  Clearly Paul's mom makes a better pie  He likes on top of the garnish  A good consistency  It's extra  It's such a thing  I'm calling crazy  You're calling your mom lazy Sam  Well my mom doesn't  No crazy  Crazy  Oh crazy  Oh  Yeah I'll be crazy  Have a good day bro  Alright there goes Mad Dog 
[02:35:00]  My mom isn't  Is not motivated to make any  Anything for you guys  Why?  Why not?  It seems like everyone is rooting for her  We were rooting for her  That's why it's so frustrating  Yeah cause it's heavy  He doesn't understand an opportunity  When it's right in front of her eyes  Well you guys have done the  Trademark Opie and Anthony routine  Which was just bust balls  Until it's fun  And go way past that  Until you're hurting the people  Oh jeez  Someone should get a job  At the Martha Stewart show  Bobby you don't agree with that do you? 
[02:35:30]  You guys are being kind of mean  Ouch  I hope that hurts you  Opie specifically  Why always me specifically?  Because you instigate all of it  You don't see what Ant's doing today I guess  He's saying nice things  Yeah  He is  I think we should not focus on this  Exactly  I think we should focus on the birthday  Thank you  At least somebody has some sense  The fact that it's her special day  Yeah  And you know  She's gonna be treated  Very nicely on her birthday  Yeah  You don't have to cook dinner 
[02:36:00]  Or anything tonight do you?  Oh no I won't do that  No I won't  Good good  Did you guys like cheesecake then?  Oh look  Yeah the cheesecake was good  Oh wait a little spark here  Wait a minute  Maybe some reasoning going on  In Bobby's  Well well well  Yeah let's hear about this cheesecake  It's like this new recipe  That Sam was talking about  We tested it out last night  I kind of liked it  Oh testing  Testing  Oh some testing going on  There's something going on  Behind the scenes  A little laboratory action 
[02:36:30]  Yeah  It's amazing  I might be able to get behind this ad  And I also did a new recipe  That I wanted to try out  For cheese biscuits  I love to tell you some biscuits  The cheese biscuits  I bet on that horse in the fifth  Cheese biscuits  Ah look at cheese biscuits go  Tom  Rounding the corner  It's cheese biscuits  The half and 23 and five  They round the five turn  Just so you know  The full story here  Uh huh  She can't help herself  Just like her boy Sam  Right  They're both extremely competitive  And as they're trying to downplay this 
[02:37:00]  You hear what she's doing right  Uh huh  She can't let it go  No  She knows deep in her soul  That Paul's mom is kicking her ass  And she's not going to  Well I mean  And she's floating out things  Just a little  Yes  How about cheese biscuits  I got cheese biscuits here  She knows deep in her soul  That Paul's mom showed up  And threw some slop  In some cupcake containers  Oh slop  Yeah I mean  Oh jeez  Honestly  This stuff looks like mucus  With limes on top  Let's be honest  About what's in front of her  But it doesn't matter man  Mucus and jism 
[02:37:30]  But until she gets back  Holy shit  Mucus and jism  But until your mom  Mucus and jism parts  Until your mom jisms in a cup  That's right  What there's no  Because there's no discussion  Until she gets back  Into the competition  It doesn't matter  Paul's mom is the  Fucking champion  Maybe my mom feels  Feels that her work should  Her previous work  Should speak for itself  Let's hear about  The cheese biscuits  Yeah what's up  With the cheese biscuits  Cheese biscuits  How do you make one of those  Or is it cheese cake biscuits  No no no  Cheese biscuits  Really what kind of cheese  Cheddar  From Munda 
[02:38:00]  Oh my god  I love cheddar  Yeah cheddar boy  Cheese cake sounds awful  No no no  Cheese biscuits  They're not sweet  Oh I love cheese biscuits  Cheddar cheese biscuits  Now I'm weakening Bobby  Because they're not  They don't taste overly cheesy  But there's a hint of it  And they have the consistency  Of cheese  The way it kind of sticks together  They're very delicious  Oh god  I'm sure they are  Very delicious  Oh  Bobby what are we talking about now  Come on  Come on  Come on  What are we talking about  I'm a weak man  We need some of them 
[02:38:30]  Cheese biscuits  How quick  How quick  Yeah how quick  Can you FedEx them  To Roland immediately  Yeah well not to Roland  If you continue down this road  I'm about to say  Fuck Paul's mom  Let's go  Come on  Paul is sweating a little bit  He is sweating a little bit  Because Paul hasn't been  On the other side of this  He's still new at this  Like he thinks this is all  Just going to be good for him  The whole time  He hasn't realized  The part where they insult him  And his mother  Is yet to come  I don't see these guys  Being that way  They seem very fair 
[02:39:00]  And above board  Alright  Listen I think you guys  Should get an oven  And stall there  In the studio  So does Anthony  We don't need an oven  Because we got Paul's mom  She won't give you  The cheese biscuits  Unless they're fresh  From the oven  Oh really  Oh so they have to be made fresh  Oh that's why the oven  So you can come in here  And bake for us  Well they do that  For Martha Stewart right 
[02:39:30]  Yeah but they use like  Hot plates and toaster ovens  It's expensive to get  A whole oven installed  We don't need an oven  I'll just eat it cold  With some butter  Yeah  Yeah  Fuck it  Yeah  We got Mike  Your mom hung up  I swear  Oh cheese biscuits  Mike Francesca  Is checking in  Ah cheese biscuits  Francesca  Boys  Let me get this clear  Here okay  You're comparing  Bobby Roberts  Okay  Who's a good baker  Tell him to bake 
[02:40:00]  For Paul's mother  She's the best baker  In the world  Okay  She's the best baker  In the world  Okay  You learn Bob  What is Bobby Roberts  Doing okay  Wow  Holy shit  I don't even know  What you said  Because that's a dead  On impression  You just took me  Out of the fucking bit  Startlingly good impression  Let's get this straight  Okay  You're going to be  Bobby Roberts  Okay  I mean  When I talk him  All the stupid  Yeah okay  I mean  Holy shit  It's pretty good  Wow  Right on  What's wrong with that man 
[02:40:30]  I killed today  Good afternoon boys  Alright  That's great  Who is that  Who is that  He calls all the time  I can't remember  That was my mom  She's great  I actually thought  That was Francesca  At first  No shit  Wow  That's dead on  Bobby  I didn't hang up on you  I swear  Whoa  Bobby  She hung up again  Is she fucking  Come on cheese biscuits  Get it together  Cheese biscuits  Sheddar cheese biscuits  They're really good  Yeah but you can talk  And talk and talk  Until they're here 
[02:41:00]  Well I had them last night  You said you had cheesecake  Last night  That was dessert  Obviously  How much cheese  Does she have  Oh my god  How much cheese do you need  All cheese products  Maybe there was  Some washed over cheese  Cheese hats  For everyone  Sculpt a cheese dildo  Enough of cheese  Cheese cape  Yeah cheese fist  Enough of the cheese  Cheese is another thing  For the young  Yeah  Get a little older  You can only  Just enough cheese  It really gums up the works  Oh boy  Oh boy does it  I like Tom Papa though  He's a voice of reason 
[02:41:30]  Today  You feel like that  Yes man  Because he doesn't have  A vested interest in this  No I just  I'm just here to enjoy  And this  Key lime really is good  The crust is very good  Well you can't hold it  It's not crust  No no  You don't have to be  Having to hold it  It's not  It comes with a fork  You're not cuddling with it  Yeah what the fuck  It's not finger food  Bobby  I'm back  I thought you guys  Were hanging up on  No I swear  No  She's pretty excited  It's way better to have you on 
[02:42:00]  Than hang up on you  She can't  That's a compliment  She needs to make  The cheese biscuits fresh  Because  She's under such  Scrutiny here  That if she doesn't  Put forth her best effort  You guys will say  Paul's mom's  Jizzum cakes  Are the best  We didn't say jizzum  And Paul  Why are you being so  Docile over there  He knows they're jizz  Because he's so confident  Because he jizzed in the cakes  He's just letting the  Cakes speak for themselves  That's right  He doesn't need to  You're letting everyone  Hear the panic  In Sam's voice  There's no panic  He's just confident 
[02:42:30]  He just kicks back  I hear it too  If I give Sam a fight  He can actually attack me  And make me look stupid  But if I let everything  You know  The baked goods  Speak for themselves  That's right  It's all on him  And his mom  He's nervous  Because they're not  Even showing up  To the competition  They're not even  Showing up to the  Starting line  That's right  She's been talking  About cheese biscuits  Oh yeah  The cheddar cheese biscuits  Talk  Talk is cheap  Talk is cheap  You can have your wish  For cheese biscuits  In one hand  And these fine  Key lime pies  In the other  Right right  Your mom needs to make  Cheddar cheese biscuits 
[02:43:00]  Immediately  Yes  Oh my god  She might be listening  And we'll microwave  That shit  And I bet  It'll taste fucking good  Paul's mom  Will sprinkle  Pre-shredded cheese  On Pillsbury dough  And call them  Cheese biscuits  Oh my  We're talking about  Real shit from scratch  Shit from scratch  She has like  A little basement  I'm talking about  The biscuits  Obviously  Paula  Yeah what does she  Do  Yeah  His name's Paula  He's turned into a bitch  That was good  Like a woman  I can appreciate that  That was very clever 
[02:43:30]  Thank you  Thank you  Bobby  Yeah  You're teasing us  Tell us more about  The cheddar cheese  I want to tell you  If you guys were  Real connoisseurs  Of baked goods  You would know  That fresh from the oven  Is the way to go  Boom  So you guys really  Do need an oven  In the studio  I'm serious  Wow  That sounds expensive  Yeah it does sound  A little expensive  What do you have  A big oven  In your studio  You got a big  Hot oven Bobby  What kind of oven  You got  Oh jeez  What do you got  One of those 
[02:44:00]  Big fucking  Six burners  It's probably  A cheap oven  Remember what I said  Before  It's probably  A shitty cheap oven  Right Bobby  No I bet she's got  Like a big  Yeah one of those  You got a big wolf oven  Right  Bobby  Six burners  I dare you to prove me wrong  And a grill  I think you got a cheap  Shitty oven  It's got a grill on it  What kind of oven  You're not  I'm afraid to answer  You guys  Why  It's just an oven  Easy bake piece of crap  I'm begging you  To prove me wrong  I really think  You don't even have  The proper equipment  Maybe that's what it is  Six burner wolf 
[02:44:30]  Right  What do you got  Mom will you do me a favor  And just tell me  You have a nice oven  So you can push the button  No no no no  I want an honest answer  No really  Maybe that's why  She's not making good things  Because her equipment  Is lacking  Yep  Yep  Why don't you upgrade  Your oven  So you can make  Some good stuff  I make good stuff  So you got a good oven  I have got a good oven  Yeah  What kind is it  Stop it  That sounded like a mom 
[02:45:00]  That stopped a whole lot  Stop it  Go to your room  I felt like I was 13 again  I know  All of a sudden  He just lays into the stop  And I'm like  I'm over this  Winner  Don't get smart  I know  That's a don't get smart  That was the voice of a mom  Don't push that cunt button  Damn  Alright Bobby  So  I'm going to give you  I'm going to give you guys this  I'll tell you the kind of oven it is 
[02:45:30]  I have a Viking oven  Oh  Vikings a good oven  Very good  That's good  Is that top of the line?  Yeah  It can't get any better  Viking is probably  One of the best ovens out there  The best that money can buy  The best that money can buy  Who bought that one for you?  Sam's dad  Oh  That backfired  Sam's dad 
[02:46:00]  That's okay  Well you know  Marital assets are  All the same  We do understand that  Have you ever seen  Neighbors  Do your neighbors have  Viking ovens?  I don't know  Probably not right?  I have no idea  Do you feel privileged  To have a Viking oven?  That's a good question Ant  Do you feel a little privileged?  That's a really good question  You do?  Yeah  I bet  God damn rich cunt  I'm sure she didn't see that coming 
[02:46:30]  I'm sure no one saw that coming  I got a good joke  Nailed her again  Oh boy  I got a good joke  What kind of oven do you got?  It's a Viking?  What is it?  Play in Minnesota?  Good one Chip  Good one Chip  That is a good one Chip  Sorry  What is your oven  Come over on a ship and stuff  With a hat?  That's a good one Chip  Thanks  You don't have to acknowledge the jokes  Good one Chip  Chip just let a cheese biscuit out of his ass 
[02:47:00]  The dog was right under your chair when you farted  That dog loves Chip's ass  Are we at  Wow  The oven costs $10,000 to $12,000  Maybe $15,000  No those are expensive  We redid our kitchen  And you couldn't afford that  Wow  You couldn't afford it  $15,000 oven  Unless you got a deal  That's crazy  Wow  My dad loves a bargain  It's amazing that so many shitty baked goods  Are coming out of that oven  Oh  Oh 
[02:47:30]  In all fairness  We can't say that  Because she gave up  Right  So we're not even getting shitty baked goods  At this point  It's just a cold oven  But she did tease us with the cheddar cheese biscuits  I think that  Hot out of the oven  I think you gotta get both moms making the same thing  Oh that's a good one yeah  Paul your mom would easily make that and send them up here right?  My mom used to run a couple of restaurants back in the day  Called cheese biscuit  You know why  Called cheese biscuit hut  You understand why Paul's mom used to run a couple of restaurants don't you? 
[02:48:00]  She's probably retired now  She probably made her money and decided to fucking relax a bit  She's banking on his big radio career  They've all gone horribly out of business  Did they Paul?  She's trying to get me a radio career  That's the problem  Paul did they?  The family's in financial ruin because of Paul's mom's cooking  Is that true Paul?  No  Not at all  Yes it is  She ran a small chain of cheese biscuits down in Georgia  More lies from Team Robert  More lies  My mother happens to have a six burner two oven grill and riddle  Riddle?  I think she means griddle 
[02:48:30]  Restaurant Garland oven  She just said  Garland oven  She's listening and texting in  Oh fuck this is some real shit  How stupid is Paul's mom?  The whole point  We don't care how stupid she is  We just care how  Exactly  She bakes  She's an idiot savant  Bobby I'm really  A dummy who can bake  Oh shit  We apologize this had to happen on your birthday  Yeah  We're still extremely disappointed 
[02:49:00]  It's your birthday  It's your birthday  Yeah  It's your birthday  I wish  I don't want Sam to be so mean to Paul's mom  He should be generous and kind to her  My mom loves that I get to be the one who's mean to Paul's mom  And she can just be the nice person  Yeah she's the good cop  Yeah yeah exactly  I feel like I'm staring at your mom when I look at you Sam  Yeah  You two are very similar  It's alright  I told you I'm a cunt  But I'm letting the replay do it  Oh  Oh I didn't mean it like that  Oh jeez 
[02:49:30]  Now it's now  It's just getting  Now it's getting  Really bad  No one pressed a button for that  No  Jesus  That just came out of a human mouth  That wasn't a button  Wow  We at least had coverage  Jeez  Yeah  It didn't be anything  This is like a  Fucking  Keep it in good taste  Does anybody remember last day?  Yeah  Christ almighty  Wow  This is like a gang war now  Please  These are demon key lime cupcakes  What is that?  This is all of a sudden 
[02:50:00]  Now it turned real  It's real now  It's just evil baked into this  Bobby I'm going to apologize to you  On that one  Wow  Yeah  Happy birthday  Somebody should  It's her birthday  I know  Happy birthday  It's for Paul to just  Happy birthday  Wow  Paul  You didn't have to do that  Your mom's the official leader  That's right  That takes some pleasantries  Right out of these baked foods  They don't seem so sweet anymore  No  They really don't  No  There might be cyanide in this shit  You see them both in the kitchen  Making these  They have that goddamn content 
[02:50:30]  Oh man  Cut more lime  We got to beat that content  Jeez  Horrible things going on  Now everyone feels like  They can say the word  Jeez  I thought they were all  Like bluebirds at the windows  Now it's black crows  Just run  I can't believe that word  Is just flying on  Bobby's mom  That is terrible  You want to comment on that?  Maybe you don't want it  Because that was rough  I mean I don't even think she's  Bobby?  Yeah  That was bad wasn't it? 
[02:51:00]  Yeah  Yeah  See what I  Like the bluebird scenario  Is what it's like  In my mom's kitchen  And it's just  Not obviously  In other kitchens  I know  That other kitchen's  Making key lime cunt cakes  Terrible  And you guys just indulged  I can't believe  Well we didn't know  They were made with demon seed  Wow  Awful  Really bad  Damn  I don't even know where to go with that  You have a runny nose  Well it's winter  It's getting there  It's not winter  It's 70 degrees out  It's like 70 degrees  But seasonal  The seasons are changing 
[02:51:30]  And with that comes seasonal allergies  Of course  Good lord  You understand  That's going to end up in our cheese biscuits  Uh mommy  Mommy are you  You worry that Sam's got the sniffles today?  Oh no I'm not worried  Jeff will take care of him  See  You're passing on some of your duties already I say  Call of duty  You're supposed to be rubbing  You're supposed to be rubbing the Vicks on Sammy's chest there  That's grossly untrue  Yeah  He's like move over Jess 
[02:52:00]  I got this  Opens up Sam's shirt  Oh god  Vicks  Vicks paper rub  Vicks paper rub  Through his chest hairs  Oh that's terrible  Getting his chest hair over me  You see with the Vicks  And stirring cheese biscuits with the other hand  He does have the perfect mom  Well it's her birthday  What are you going to give your mom?  She's on the phone  Are you going to give her  Surprise would be ruined  Are you going to take her out? 
[02:52:30]  What are you going to do?  Well Saturday is the big family get together  What are you going to do?  We're going to go out to a nice dinner  Not too nice of course  But wherever she wants to go  Maybe we'll go to a little  Chinese place  Paul's mom's house  For birthday dinner  You hear that aunt?  Chinese food  Chinese  What kind of Chinese food?  I mean probably  Not just like  You know cheap Chinese food  Oh really?  Well how expensive is the Chinese food?  Well I'm just saying  Like we wouldn't go to the place  Where you could  The menu is like above the cash register 
[02:53:00]  You don't order by number right?  No hell no  No no no  Ah a little fancy place  Nice Chinese place  There's a very nice place  Where we know the chefs  Bobby how fancy is the Chinese place?  No no I don't  It probably won't be Chinese  Because Sam's not a big fan of Chinese  But it's your birthday  Well whose birthday is it?  Yeah I know  But I  In our house  Whoever's birthday it was  We ate their shit  That's right  In our house  What's wrong with you?  Whoever's birthday it is  They eat my shit  It's just ridiculous  How do you get a mom like this?  Is it too late? 
[02:53:30]  It is too late  It is  Well if you get a cold  See if she'll rub some Vicks on you  Yeah I don't need to turn this shit  Into sexual crap  It would be nice to have a mom  Rubbing Vicks on my chest  At this point in your life  Yes  Very strange  Lower stomach maybe  Lower stomach  Not draped  Exactly  Slower  Slower  If it jumps let it hit the back of your hand  Jimmy talks about draped and undraped 
[02:54:00]  Yes  I prefer undraped massage  The massage industry  Undraped  Undraped  Yes  You gotta use the proper terminology  Terminology  I mean we don't have to do this all day  I guess to summarize  Paul's mom came through once again  And she's already thinking about her  She's great  Her cheese biscuits  Yeah but she bakes them in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre  How's the evil that happens  Well you know what doesn't matter  I don't have to live with her  I'm just fucking eating her baked goods 
[02:54:30]  That's right  I don't know what's in them is what I'm saying  I don't care if Bobby's  Key lives  Oh hey guys  Why going to Tupperware has Paul's mom got there?  Shitty is the answer to that question  Why Bobby do you have expensive Tupperware?  Oh my god  You guys said it was like you know super special or something  It's nice  It's like a little carry along thing that fits like  I've never seen a Tupperware container like this  You can fit 12 little cupcake-y size things in there  It's the same bullshit that Paul brought in last time 
[02:55:00]  No and it's got some kind of seals on this  What are those?  Navy  Yeah Navy  Latches  Glass latches on the side  Latches on the side to keep in the freshness  And keep the lid on  And the handle  Keep on the lid nice and tight  And then there's a handle  Yeah you can tote it around with you  You don't have to use two hands  Tupperware from the future  Yeah it really is  It's beautiful  That sounds fancy  It is fancy  That's pretty fancy  What's your Tupperware look like?  No no no  She wants to talk about Paul's mom's Tupperware  You see what she's doing here  Yeah  It looks fancy 
[02:55:30]  Really?  Yes she is  I want to know if any of Paul's hair is in the Tupperware  Oh  Exactly  Oh no I don't think there's any  Yeah but we got to explain to Tom  You're talking to a woman Tom Popper  Yes  That saved Sam's hair  In a Tupperware container  Yeah  What?  And how old is that hair now?  What?  How old is the hair now Bobby?  Huh?  I'm only a few years old  That's all  I mean it's going on  No the afro  That was from his college years right?  Yeah  So  Yeah  What? 
[02:56:00]  So Sam decided  Sam's hair was about the same length it is now  He decided to shave it down  His mom goes  Holy shit I've got to save your afro  And it's in a Tupperware container  Like a lot of it?  All of it?  All  I've seen it  Oh my god  I've seen it once  But she still has it in her house  Why?  Have you ever wanted to throw a match in something so badly in my life?  How that would have went right up?  Irreplaceable  Yeah  It wasn't  That's terrible  It's creepy  That's awful  That is creepy  That's the trade off though  When you get the Vicks Vapor Rub down on your nipples 
[02:56:30]  But then you also get that  Did you ever rub like oil on the back of Sam's leg  If he hurt his like hamstrings?  Like he'd be on his stomach after a sports injury  And you'd rub the back of the leg  I didn't  I wasn't an athletic  And then maybe like the legs would open a little bit  And arch your ass a bit  Why would I?  Oh my god  And there's a little finger brush on the back of the bag  We're getting dangerously close to having phone sex with Jim again  Yeah  Oh god  Yeah Jim tricks you into having phone sex with him  It's a new thing I know 
[02:57:00]  They've never had a sports injury  That's right  Well maybe it was an injury from jumping around pretending he was a wrestler  Or tap dancing  Maybe one of his tap class  Tap class  Maybe one of his adductors got injured  No  Oh good news  What's that?  It's going to be a cheap plug  But I will tweet the video of me talking to you about the afro hair  And show it off  Because you brought it in in a container  Oh that's so gross  I'll tweet it  It's a cheap plug 
[02:57:30]  I'll acknowledge it's a cheap plug  Hey Bobby  Yeah  You do your own shopping huh?  I do my own what?  You do your own shopping for all this stuff?  Sure  Yeah  No I was just wondering  Oh you were I'm sorry  No you do your own shopping  So you go to the store yourself and get everything  It's not delivered right?  What do you take there?  You drive?  Probably public transportation  You take the bus?  Probably  No I drive 
[02:58:00]  Oh you drive  Oh okay I'm sorry  I thought maybe you took the bus  What uh  What you driving these days?  What am I driving?  What are you driving these days?  What kind of car?  Usually I drive  I drive an SUV  What kind?  Alexa  God damn  We've had the Lexus for many years  Well let's ask Paul 
[02:58:30]  What kind of car does your mom drive?  Um  Chevy Tahoe  Oh jeez  Oh jeez  Oh yeah  I was thinking if I should tell her not but that  That doesn't really uh  Well  Well she  Didn't do well with the baked goods so  Well Tahoe's a pretty impressive car  Is it?  It's like Snow Lexus  It's not a luxury vehicle  Alright Bobby we're going to give you the car competition  Congratulations  You drive a better car than Paul's mom  But Paul's mom's still the baking champion  If only we could eat it 
[02:59:00]  Yeah  I'm going to work on it guys  I'm going to work on it  See  She can't let this go  Because she's a competitor  How quickly can she get cheese biscuits to the show?  This is what I've been trying to get out of her for weeks  She's a competitor in the end  You hope it happens like today  Or at least by tomorrow  Bobby  How about this?  We can make a deal with you  Because we don't have the oven installed yet  You can make the fresh cheddar cheese biscuits  Sam brings them in  And we will acknowledge that they would taste even better if they came right out of the oven  Your word means nothing 
[02:59:30]  What?  It's on record  You'll acknowledge that will you?  It's on record  It's on record  There's nothing in your behavior  That would make it seem like you will actually acknowledge it  I didn't do shit  I understand  Could you keep them warm?  Maybe we can have them  Maybe she can wrap them in a pair of her panties  What is that even type of talk?  That's not even right  He's just trying to figure out if anyone's interested in having phone sex  He just keeps fishing  He just keeps casting out  And then he tricks it  And all of a sudden you're giving him this knowledge  You're like  Wait, I'm having phone sex with my pal 
[03:00:00]  Why don't you keep those biscuits nice and warm in the panties?  Just keep those biscuits warm  There must be something evil in the key lines or something  Evil in the key lines  That's it  Things are getting weird around here  I'd go see that band  Evil in the key lines  He's either farting on you or tricking you into phone sex  Yeah  Wrap up those biscuits  Jim's got some trickery  He does  Wrap them up  Jim gets tired and then he gets horny  I start filling up 
[03:00:30]  After two key line  I just want to picture her wrapping up those  Little cheese biscuits  You're like a little creepy  Creepy uncle that ate too much at Thanksgiving now  Just sitting on the couch  No, she would tie them up  Like you ever see when a kid runs away  He's got the little stick  That's how the biscuits would be tied up  In a pair of her panties  Not a handkerchief?  Yeah, like a handkerchief  But instead it would  Sam, what's your Twitter?  A bandana  Not Sam  It is? 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, my Twitter's not Sam  Oh, okay  Not Sam  I'm tweeting the video of the afro hair  Oh, thank God  Another cheap plus  Thank God  Bobby, happy birthday  Yes  Thank you very much  I respect and I like the fact that you might be back in  I feel it  I feel it in your bones  You're turning back into the Bobby we know that's inside you  And that's going to make us some lovely baked goods  She does  I'll do my best  When I go over there  She does say  So what should I make? 
[03:01:30]  Oh yeah, she can't let this go  And I tell her not to make anything  That's terrible  I say don't make anything for those  What I say is those assholes  Oh  Wow  Sam's extremely competitive  That's snobby  Yeah  No, Sam just doesn't want to lose  It is, where did I learn that from?  Sam doesn't want to lose  He's afraid  It's easier to say that  Than to bring in a product that is subpar  And then what would the excuse be  All the biscuits would have been good  But they were wrapped in pennies  The coppery flavor  Oh Jesus Christ 
[03:02:00]  Oh God  Cheese panty biscuits  Jesus  And the coppery flavor  Just gives a whole different connotation to it  Jim disgusted himself  He turned himself off  I don't mean that  Well my mother is on the phone  I don't mean that  Oh, happy birthday  We're just jealous  Yeah  I'm just jealous that I don't have a mom like Sam's mom  Who wouldn't be?  She's like everything  Say who did  Norman Bates 
[03:02:30]  I'm telling you  It's not a sexual thing with me, man  Yeah  Just like that fucking  The poster child of a mom  Just that perfect mom  Yes  And she's always been able to get us whatever we want  Well, I would assume she probably was during Christmas  You still get the whole family Christmas presents?  Oh sure  Yeah  Oh yeah  Big holiday  What are you getting for Sam this year?  Yeah, I can't tell you  It always has to be a surprise 
[03:03:00]  Can I guess?  Why does it have to be a surprise?  Well, can I guess  Is that how Santa wants him?  Yeah  Is it going to be some type of wrestling doll?  Possibly  Well, it wouldn't be a doll  They're dolls  That's ridiculous  More wrestling dolls for Sam  Oh, jeez  If that's what he wants  That's what he'll get  That's all he wants  Is dolls  Do you want a doll?  No, I don't want a doll  Action figure?  There are a few action figures that would be on my list  Yeah  Sure  Sure  You want whatever you want  Nothing wrong with that  To justify it  Mom tucking him into his bunk bed 
[03:03:30]  Lining up his figurines  They are figurines  Figurines I can expect  They're wrestling hummels  I think Sam's bed is in like a car frame  Yeah  He's got the race car bed  When did you give up on that?  22?  I never had a race car  23?  I did never have a race car  I guarantee your parents gave you fancy beds too  It was a Lord of the Rings bed  I'm not into race cars  Works like a little wrestling ring  It's got like little fake ropes around it 
[03:04:00]  I would love that bed  But I did not have that  You can go ding, ding, ding  Mind of the bed  Hit me again, Mommy  We had five boys in one room  With one set of bunk beds  Oh my gosh  Wow  That's hell  That's so well  Three on the bottom  Two on the top  Wow  Bobby, do you guys still go on  Three on the bottom  Two on the top  Do you guys still go on like family vacations together?  Sometimes  Sometimes  What was the last one you went on?  Where did you go?  That's a great question  Yeah  Trying to get to know Bobby a little bit  The last family vacation was just in October 
[03:04:30]  We went to Kentucky all together  Oh  Buzzkill  I knew it was coming  And that's a real answer  Was it for the Kentucky Derby?  No  Oh no, it was for the family  We're talking  The backwoods  We went to Caden's  Yeah, the backwoods of Kentucky  Yeah, we were  Damn it  And that's a real answer, Ant  You blew that up  Damn it  Did you bring the hair?  They kept it in the boat  To show off  That the family was being raised in?  You guys blew my cover on the air 
[03:05:00]  No one knew I shaved that hair  I'm tweeting the video  Oh, Jesus  That's so creepy  Yeah, exactly  She makes a little pillow out of it  Sleeps on it  Sammy  It's really creepy  Rubbing Vicks in it  Talking to it  He's such a big boy  You like my key lime, don't you?  I'll bet you she has a good fucking  Key lime pie  A life-size cutout of Sam  And she put the real hair on it 
[03:05:30]  And she walks by and musses the hair up  He's a good boy  I can almost guarantee that that's not the case  Yeah  Almost  She's safe for those Boy Scout uniforms  Oh  What, you gonna throw them out?  Exactly  Pay good money for those uniforms  Welcome to the Sam Roberts Museum  Here's Sam Roberts' uniform  It's like the hard rock  Yeah  Like the Biff Tannen Museum  Yeah, the Biff Tannen Museum  You know what I mean?  Animatronics  One bat on a horse  We all know the story of Sam Roberts 
[03:06:00]  He thinks he's gonna be famous  And that they'll be worth money  And people will want to see them  Nobody will  Yeah  Video clips of me molesting Jess  And almost raping her the way he did Lorraine  Yes, wow  You're gonna be my wife, Jess!  You're my girl!  Oh, creepy  That is creepy  Little animatronic doll  Good morning, Mom  Good morning, Mom  Good morning, Mom  It's just tapes of him from the radio show  And she just plays it  Creepy 
[03:06:30]  It is, right?  Hey, hey, hey, hey, you guys  Don't you think that your listeners would be interested in hearing some of the, like, more bizarre things in your life  As opposed to always hearing about Sam Roberts?  Bobby, you blew it today  Because I know what you were trying to do there  But me and Ann went pretty deep yesterday with some weird shit  Every day is a different show, though, my friend  I think that I wasted my good-looking years over a toilet bowl  Meaning I was jerking off into a toilet bowl  Because I was in an unhappy relationship 
[03:07:00]  So we went pretty deep yesterday, Bobby  Okay, and today is Sam's turn?  Today's not Sam's turn  This was just a bake-off  Yeah, this is all about getting you in the right place so you can become the champion again  That's all  Okay, got it  That's all this is about  It's her birthday  It's your birthday, trying to start off a new year, give you incentive  Sure  Rejuvenate  Alright, you guys are good with incentives, I must say  Well, I'm going to send you positive thinking tapes for your birthday 
[03:07:30]  Happy  By the way  Wait a minute  Yes  Oh, go ahead  Happy  He said, by the way  How old is this bitch?  Well, I'm trying to show  A lady never tells  How old lady?  Yeah, I wasn't even going to go there  I'm 57 years young  I remember Sam when he was  Remember how he used to not eat the food?  He wanted the fish sticks  You remember how I'd make him eat the fish sticks?  I'd hold him through the zipper  Go have a fish stick 
[03:08:00]  Oh, that's the hair?  Holy crap  Yes it is  No  It filled up a huge Tupperware container  That's disgusting  It's horrible  It's all  But she saved it  How creepy is that?  And I think she still has his baby teeth in the freezer, right?  She's collecting parts to me  She's going to rebuild them when he dies  Right  Hopefully make a version that isn't an idiot  One can only hope  One without a brain  Yeah  That's disgusting 
[03:08:30]  I've never  I've heard of people saving a lock of hair  But not a giant afro  No, it's in this Tupperware  I dump it on the floor  Look how much it is  That is hard  It's like a beach ball of hair  It's completely unnecessary  That's the creepiest thing I've ever  It's so weird that she saved it  It's just such a  You're so aware that she puts it like down the front of her sweatpants and pretends it's 1974  She doesn't even wear sweatpants  Put the lotion in the basket  Put the fucking lotion in the basket  Put the hair in the Tupperware 
[03:09:00]  It does this when it's told  Put the hair in the Tupperware  This was way better than having Andy Dick on the fucking show  I'll tell you right the fuck  Yes  Andy Dick's getting killed on Twitter  We didn't say to do that  But he's getting beat up  Yeah, well, that's what happens when you're late  Yeah  When you don't show up on time  It's the big show  Wow  Big guy  Tom Popp is going to be at the Stress Factory Friday and Saturday  Yeah  And he does a show here on XM or Sirius? 
[03:09:30]  On  Are they the same?  Well, you're a crush  Sirius XM 99  I'm on Raw Dog  Oh, so they're on both  Yeah  Anyway, we're trying to maybe give them a little promotion on this channel  Thank you  Because you keep talking about this Super Dave Osborne interview you did  Saying he's dirty and really funny  Yeah, hilarious  So we're going to try to rerun it on our channel  The bosses don't know that yet  Because we haven't told them what we're going to do  Yeah, we're going to do it  Guess what?  It's the Opie and Anthony channel  Not your channel  That's right, Sam Roberts  So hopefully we can get that done 
[03:10:00]  Yeah, that'd be great  Thanks  Give you a little more promotion for that show  A couple more listeners  You do one a week?  I do one a week  And you've done Mel Brooks  This week is Ray Romano  Is on Friday  And yeah, I've done Mel Brooks  Carl Reiner  Damn  Colin Quinn  Seinfeld  Oh boy  One of these things is not like  Yeah, yeah, yeah  I try to throw it in  No, we love Colin  He rules  Colin was really tearing it up on Twitter last night  Oh, yeah  Boy, he just loves the hate

[03:11:00]  Okay  Yeah, that was a different one with Daryl Hammond  Oh, I was wondering why he didn't promote it  Because Bob Saget just promoted that on our show  Yeah  Yeah, that was Monday  That was Scleroderma  Scleroderma  For his sister, Bob Saget  And the other one  I forget what LA was  Oh, I apologize  He told me  Yeah  Alright  Jimmy's second show at the Brigada is going on sale  Or is on sale  Friday morning  Oh, Friday morning  The January 15th Sunday night show  First show is sold out  Goes on sale  Friday morning 9 a.m.  There's no pre-sale  Myself, Artie Lang  Doug Stanhope, Dave Attell

Well what am I going to  Like you guys  She said  I will of course  Have her on  But you guys just had her on  You hear how she answered that?  No  Cause she's like  She's bummed out  She's like  You really  You know why she's bummed out?  Cause she thought you were going to let her off the phone 
[03:17:00]  And then you kept talking to her  That's why she's bummed out  That would do it  Yes  Ant did  Not me  I didn't do anything  You just started talking to her  No Ant did  Why do you have to put a bad spin on it?  We had a nice song  Everything was good  We ended on a nice note  You had to make it sad  Yeah we had a high note  We learned over the years  We don't know how to end a radio show anymore  It was over  The show was done  I don't know what happened  I had my jacket on  We had that nice song from the  The male eating pumpkin guy  We just don't know how to end a fucking show anymore 
[03:17:30]  Well you could say  You could take a bite of my mom  Say thanks  Bye  Hang up on her  That's step one  You need a phrase at the end  You know like  Good luck and goodnight  Yeah  Something like that  Or a catchphrase  Yeah  That's the way it was  I have cum  I have pre-cum on my sweatpants  Pre-cum  Yeah  I do  And some right here  Look at that  That's actually cum  Good luck with  Is that from today?

That's kind of bizarre  It's not that I don't want her  It's that we already did  I understand what it is  45 minutes  Sam wants to take over this channel  He's doing very well  He has already  This hour is already his  And he actually thinks  That you don't do a good job on the radio  That if you're on Opie and Anthony  Their listenership will drop  And then he will look better 
[03:22:00]  So he therefore does not have you on his show  I've had this conversation with her  Mom you want to get on the after show  You got to be a lot stronger  Than you do on the morning show  Okay  I'm just kidding  Alright mom  We're going to say goodbye  And go to break  And then keep listening  Because then my show will start  Okay well you know  I'll be listening to your show  Thank God for that  Goodbye  Thank you very much  Alright  Bye Bobby  See you later mom  Bye  Happy birthday  Happy birthday  Thank you  Bye  Hit it Eric  Serious XM  Hey hey hey 
[03:22:30]  And now  The Opie and Anthony show  Continues  Continues  This is After O&A Live  Here's your host  Sam Roberts  Oh yeah  We're here  Jim's hanging around  Opie and Anthony are gone  Jim's got to travel  So  Yeah  Call the airport  What's he going to do  Stand outside the studio  Actually that may be  A better alternative  You wouldn't have to  Deal with me  If he just stood  Outside the studio  And pointed at me  And said I'm not going  To do your show  Ha ha  What do you mean 
[03:23:00]  Because you have to be here  Until 11 anyway  Oh I don't know  I'd rather be on here  And plug my gigs  Somebody's listening  This show by the way  After Opie and Anthony Live  Is brought to you by  Trojan Bearskin Condoms  Trojan America's  Number one  Most trusted condom brand  And I thought that  This show had left me  A beaten person  But my mother's voice  Now when she's on the phone  Yeah  Because she's just  Put through the same thing  Over and over again  She is becoming  A beaten woman  Yeah  And that's why 
[03:23:30]  She's become  The way we're like  You know what  I'm not going to do anything  Because it's just  Going to get shit on anyway  She's like  Do I really want to  Bring in these guys  Baked goods  Like Paul  I kind of brought it up  A little bit on the air  Like you're still  In that  Honeymoon spot  Happy to be here  Where they're being nice to you  And being nice to your mom  You don't understand  That it turns around  And you  You and your mother  Will be right there  Well  I'm also not here  That often  Which is probably  To your favor  Yeah absolutely 
[03:24:00]  So you know  I think if the beating comes  I might actually escape it  If I'm out that day  So who knows  On a day that just happens  To be my mother's birthday  I had no idea  I don't think to his  I hope he didn't know either  But  No  At least  At least she got a song  From Roland  Eric did you isolate  The end of Roland's song  Yeah  Hang on  Okay  Because did you hear  When Roland was singing  And he tried to  Oh we isolated  In the Pro Tools thing  Not in here  Okay can you get  Can you do it  Or whatever  Because I want to hear  What Roland said 
[03:24:30]  The final sentence  Of course my mom  Was a last minute  Fill in for Andy Dick  Yes  Who I guess was late  And he's here now  He's in the building  Right  You saw him  Apparently  We didn't know this  But a note came in  That he went into  Broad Mind  At like 9-15  I guess his Twitter  Album's right  Album's right  Album's right  Album's right  And his Twitter  Was getting killed  But he said  That he wanted  To come in after  I would have been  Interesting to at least  Hear an explanation  As to why he was  Because the way  I look at it  Is if it's bad  Yeah  None of us  Are going to  Tolerate bullshit 
[03:25:00]  Right  But if it's cool  It's cool  But if it's bad  We acknowledge it  If he's still here  We should get him in  Right  Yeah  I already tell Roland  If he wants to  That'd be good  Especially since you're here  So it's not just  Dopey me  But I don't know  I mean  I think Andy Dick  Is ridiculous enough  That something would  Come of it  Who knows  I mean  I just  I don't know  What are the fans  Saying about him  Paul could you  See on the computer  What the fans  Are saying about him  On Twitter  Because I don't know  He was supposed to be  In Andy Dick  Today at like 840 
[03:25:30]  And then we realized  At 5 after 9  He wasn't here  We thought he was  Just going to no show  We totally cancelled him  Yeah  And then my mom  Was abused for 45 minutes  Or so  But he's here  He came in anyway  And he was going to  Do this show  And now he's doing  His other shows  Search for like  At Andy Dick  Because I don't know  If you can get  The at mentions  I see what they say  Well somebody told him  That he was getting killed  On  He said I'll be  Not there bashing him 
[03:26:00]  But the show  Really wasn't bashing him  No  But he didn't  You know  I mean there were  How can you not go on  I don't know  Well hopefully  Hopefully we can get him in here  So he can explain himself  Yeah  I think we judged him  On reputation alone  Yeah  We have no prior experience  I've never met him  Well  I've never met him either  But he's weird enough  That  Who cares  Let's just find out  You don't have to like  Everybody that's on the show  No  The worst thing that happens 
[03:26:30]  Is it's not good  But we would acknowledge that  I don't think the show  Would sit here and tolerate it  If somebody was bad  Or shitty to us  We wouldn't  You know  We would address that  Head on  Yeah  If it's interesting  Paris Hilton was the brunt of that  Not too long ago  Again  Paris Hilton is a much  More famous person  Yeah  And we  Of course we took her  All of us wanted her  We all said yes  Immediately  And she was awful  And I bet you he'll be better  Than she will  You know what I mean  And she found out  That we didn't like  What she was doing  And Paris Hilton is 
[03:27:00]  As famous as she is  You still didn't let her  Get away with much  I mean  She was terrible  As passive aggressive  As I've maybe ever seen you  During the Paris Hilton interview  I'll tell you why  I didn't really let her  Have it  Was just because  I was thinking  It's bad for the show  To just attack her  She's not being mean  She's just being a dunce  Yeah  She wasn't  You know what I mean  She didn't do anything  That merited be going  You fucking bitch  She didn't do anything  That deserved that  She was just being  An awful interview  But I mean 
[03:27:30]  Sometimes being  Passive aggressive  Is worse  Yeah  Like  Because she knows  What you're doing  Yeah  And the fact that  You're not coming clean  With it  And just kind of  Looking at her  Like yeah  I am doing  What you think  I'm doing  Is kind of worse  Because it  It hits you  Eric  Do you have  Roland's thing  Yes  Okay  This is  Roland saying  Happy birthday  To my mom  Because  On her birthday  Of all days  Opie and Anthony  Decided to call her  And I guess  Berate her  Because Paul's mom  Made some  Key line  Whatever those things  Are  Deliciousness  They don't look delicious 
[03:28:00]  And I certainly  Won't be tasting them  But Roland  I guess  I think he tried  To take a shot  Roland is about  As flip floppy  As it gets  Because he's come  On the after show  Before many times  And he specifically  Said that your mom's  Key line pies  Were not good  He said  Actually Sam  You're right  Paul's mom's  Key line pies  Weren't good  And so today  I guess  He decided  That he's going  To go on  The other side  He just goes  Wherever the room  Is going  That's where  He'll go  But this was  His retort 
[03:28:30]  Or whatever  It was  Happy birthday  To you  Happy birthday  To you  Happy birthday  Dear Bobby  I hope you  Better bake  Key limes  Than Paul's mom too  I hope you  Better bake  Key lime  Pies  Than Paul's mom  Too  There's so many  Where is he  If he's around  You should come in here  Because I want  I'm assuming  He's waiting outside  Of the studio 
[03:29:00]  Al Q or whatever  Oh for any dick  Okay well then  Stay there  But I'm assuming  I hope you  Bake better  Than Paul's mom  Is awful  It's like  He must constantly  Have people worried  That he's going  Through something medical  That his brain  Is shutting down  Right in front of us  Because he just  You could tell  The sentence  Is formed in his head  And for some reason  Between the brain  And the mouth  It completely destructs  It's like that reporter  When she had that  What was it called  A bertation  A bertation  That's what that was 
[03:29:30]  But for Roland  It happens every day  All the time  There are more  Bertations  Than non-bertations  And then he just  Kind of mumbled  I don't know  You guys said yes  You know  He's the worst  You can never get  A straight answer  Out of him  Yeah you can't  Ever  We were talking  On the show today  Jim you don't play  Video games  I do not  No  I'm horrible  At video games  Which I mean  I'm 28  Which means I should  Still be able  To play these games  But I can't go beyond  Like Mario  Tetris 
[03:30:00]  I have the first  Call of Duty  Modern Warfare  I'm terrible at it  I mean I  Stopped playing these  Games after 45 minutes  Number one  Because I just  Can't sit in front  Of a video game  For that long  And number two  Because I'm tired  Of being bad  At something  Well yeah  Exactly  And I'm in  Grand Theft Auto  And I tried it  And I stopped it  I kept backing  Into the fucking  Fence  And I'm like  This is terrible  You couldn't  At Grand Theft Auto  I could figure out  But you  You couldn't get  Your car  Out of the driveway  I couldn't get  Out of the parking lot  I just kept  Hitting the fence 
[03:30:30]  And I threw the controller  I'm like  This blows  I'm going to use  The PS3  As a Blu-ray player  And that was it  For video games  That is it  I haven't picked it up since  I have no interest  No interest whatsoever  How long were you  Backing up into a fence for?  Between 15 and 20 minutes  And that was it  That's a long time  Yes it is  To just be consistent  I'm going to get this  I'm going to get this  Were you googling like  How do you  Back out of parking lots?  No because I'm like  If I have to do that  There's no way  I'm going to learn  How to murder a hooker  With a fucking sledgehammer  That's all you wanted to do  You heard about all these 
[03:31:00]  Like cool stories  That the guys were doing  In the games  Like oh yeah  You can get a hooker  And bring her to an alley  And then she'll blow you  And then you can kill her  And take the money back  And blah blah blah  And you're sitting there  In the parking lot  God damn it  How do I get out of this lot?  You know it's funny  It's like I'm sure  That they're fun games  Yeah  But do you know  How many women complain  That their boyfriends  And husbands  Do nothing but play video games  Do you know how many women  Yeah  Have fucked other guys  Because these  Dummies are so  Stuck in front of a keyboard  Or stuck in front of  A fucking TV monitor 
[03:31:30]  It's like  Your women are out there  Fucking other people  Because they're bored  Of waiting for you  To stop playing a video game  Yes  You might be surprised  A lot of  A lot of women  Are into video games now  I'm sure there are  And it used to be  Kind of geeky  Nerdy girls  But either the nerdy girls  Are getting hotter  Or better looking women  Are playing video games  I'm sure yeah  But most decent women  Do not play video games  And Jim's right  There are a lot  Of these girls  It's still mostly guys  Yeah  There are a lot more girls  You're totally right about that 
[03:32:00]  You go to Comic Con  You can see there's so many  More girls than there used to be  But like Jess's last  Serious boyfriend  Before me  Was that  He was playing  World of Warcraft  Non-stop  Well that's like  That's an addiction  Right  Like he was staying up  All night  And then sleeping all day  Like she said  At one point  He stayed up all night  And then he slept  Through her birthday  Because he had been up  All night playing  World of Warcraft  That's a classic  And so now  It's like literally  If I play video games  For like two days in a row  Jess is like  I don't know 
[03:32:30]  You're playing a lot  I just don't know  I don't know  She's so worried about  I'm like  I don't  I don't like video games  I'm not good at them  I don't care about them  I'm not going to become addicted  But yeah  And the women  Are just gonna go  Fuck someone else  They're gonna fuck someone else  Not that you can't play video games  But you guys  That come home  Directly from work  Yeah  And you don't  You don't lick her pussy  You're not fucking her  You're just sitting there  In front of a video screen  She's going to get dick  Somewhere else  If you  On a consistent basis 
[03:33:00]  Are sitting in front of a video game  While your girl is there  Like while she's sitting next to you  Or she has to go do something else  In the house  Like you're like  Hang on  Like you should be hanging out with her  But instead you're playing video games  Jim's absolutely right  She's going  To bang someone else  What's up Roland  Yep  What's going on with Andy Dick  Wait for him to wrap up the interview  Oh okay  Are you a video game guy  Yeah  Do you  Have you ever had issues  Because Jim  Brought this up  Like there's so many guys  They're just sitting in front of these video games 
[03:33:30]  And their chicks end up banging someone else  Because  They're oblivious to the world  That's going on around them  How much  I know Roland  Has a video game problem  In the sense that  E-Rox told me  That like late on  On Saturday night  They'll be up playing  Whatever on Xbox  On the headsets together  Red Dead Redemption  Or something  And Roland and Eric  Are on the headsets  And Eric's like  Okay Roland  So next we're going to take the horses  And go here  Roland  Roland  God damn it Roland 
[03:34:00]  You're asleep again  Yeah Roland's been standing in the middle of a field  For the last 15 minutes  I'm back  I'm back  I'm back  You fall asleep while you're playing the games  That's correct  I mean I guess  As I wake up I just continue  Yeah but then he shoots everybody's horse on his own team  Have you ever been  How much time do you spend playing video games  Uncharted 1 and 2  I'll spend like the whole weekend just playing it  But you won't do it during the week?  Like does it ever affect your work or anything? 
[03:34:30]  No I have to stop  That's why  If not  I'll just be a mess  But you do spend the whole weekend  I can spend the whole weekend non-stop  I won't sleep for like 24 hours  Do you just snack?  I just like snack  I get up  And we get up  That noise  It makes it  Because I haven't been  Get up in a while  Because I've just been set there for a while  It really does promote an unhealthy lifestyle  Because you are  You're just sitting on the couch playing  And you're snacking the whole time  And the only thing you can do is eat pizza  Because it's a quick thing  You can eat and play  One hand  Have you ever ordered pizza  While you're playing those games?  Oh I 
[03:35:00]  I was like on the headsets  As I answered the door  I can give the guy the money  And then he kept on continuing  Can't you fucking just pause it or something?  If you're playing live online you can't  Is that what the thing is now?  Because I'm so out of the video game world  Multiplayer  It's all about multiplayer?  That's why Call of Duty  That came out  They were talking about today  Is so huge  Because it's  I mean the game itself is good  But it's all multiplayer  It's just all multiplayer  He's going to be awake  Between now and Monday  He's not going to stop  He's not going to stop  See I'm so  I'm still stuck in the world  Of you've got to beat the game 
[03:35:30]  Like I guess that doesn't even happen anymore  No absolutely that happens  Absolutely that happens  There's that side of it  And then there's  You know  All online people  I just don't get it  No me neither  I wish I did  I'm glad I don't  If that makes any sense  Like I kind of wish  I could participate more  But I'm so happy  I'm not wrapped up  I'm jerking off all the time  I don't have time  I really  Yeah it's true  I mean yeah  These guys are playing video games  You're jerking off  And I'm watching wrestling tapes  So it's not like  Any of us have a terribly healthy lifestyle  I have like a few memories  In my bathroom  Where it bounces off  So I get to get shit  And still play  That's weird dude 
[03:36:00]  That's weird  I get to see the TV  Really?  Yeah  That's  That's weird  How much time do you spend shitting?  Like how long are your shits?  Sometimes they're epic  Really?  Yes  Five minutes  Twenty  Do you ever  Like cause you're in the middle  Of a good part of the game  Do you ever shit  And then you stay on the toilet  Way after you've already shit  Without wiping  Because  While you're still playing  Yeah  Yes  You do  You do  And it just starts cresting up  His asshole starts to air dry  Roll it 
[03:36:30]  You disgust me  Every part of you does  Can't you just hide somewhere  For a few minutes  When you're fucking playing?  They find you  Or then your team is like  Way advanced  And they scream at you  Where the fuck are you?  You're like shitting  And then you go  Do I wipe?  Do I lift up?  Do I wait later?  It's like  It's a lot of pressure  I can't even imagine  Playing on a team  Yeah with a whole bunch of dumb guys  There  A breaker four  Run to the left  We're not in the army  Shut up  That's not true  It's guns out  Stupid  Whatever they yell  There comes a guy  Throw the thing  Shut up  Everybody's playing Red Dead  Like we're not cowboys 
[03:37:00]  Just knock it off  Exactly  Go find a girl  And eat her ass  Fuck you doing  You riding horses?  I play wrestling games  But like now  I'm at the point  Where I'll play them  For like  A week or two  After they come out  And then I'll put them  I'll never play them again  If I don't finish a game  Within a week of it coming out  I never pick it up again  But that's like  One game a year  Like I might spend a week  Of a year  Investing in a video game  Eric  Yeah  Roland you're not  In a relationship now  Are you?  No  Eric you are married 
[03:37:30]  He plays Portal  And you do a lot  Of video game playing  Not usually during the week  What's Portal?  Portal is this game  Where you got these  Guns that you can  Like shoot a hole  In the wall  In the ceiling  So you can go  Into the wall  And fall out the ceiling  So what?  It's all about  Like physics  And geometry  And stuff  No it's a huge game  I'm sure it is  Yeah but I mean  Even like  The game doesn't  Sound entertaining  And then you say  It's about physics 
[03:38:00]  I don't want to play  A game about physics  I want to play  NBA Jam on Sega Genesis  Four people on the court  You either shoot  Or you pass  There's nothing else to do  That game rolled  I love that game  So you spend a lot  Of weekend time Eric  Not weekdays  Sometimes weekdays  I try not to  During the week  But  Why?  Because you can't  Just play for like  45 minutes?  No  Nobody can  Because you got to  Try to like  You got to try to  Limit it during the week  Because I'll just get  I'll be there  The entire afternoon  Into the evening  Playing it  Oh my god  What is 
[03:38:30]  What is your wife  What's your game  Other than Portal  Well it was  Dead Space 2  But I just finished that  And I tried  Gears of War 3  For about a week  And I know  Everyone loves it  But I kind of  Got bored  And I don't do  Those first person  Shooter games  Like Call of Duty  And everybody else likes  But you shoot  Stuff through the wall  And you fall  Into the ceiling  And you got a big hole  5 plus 5 is 10  It stinks  It's physics  It's terrible  It's an awesome game  It's not an awesome game  It is  What is awesome about it?  Portal 2 is an awesome game 
[03:39:00]  How?  How?  Explain it to me  Tell me on this game  Because it's fucked up  You're trapped in  Like this science lab  Underground  And you're just trying  To get through  All these different stages  But it's like  You have to do  Like solve puzzles  In order to open the door  To get out of the room  What kind of puzzles?  Like  Something Riddler  You'd have to  Get a block  From one area  Of the room  Where there's moats  And all these other things  That can kill you  Over to another area  Where there's a button  In order to open the door  There's lasers  And robots  Shooting at you  Fucking terrible 
[03:39:30]  It just sounds so complicated  Lasers and a robot  I don't care  Why don't you just cut it out?  I'm going to find a girl  And have her fucking  Her ass in my face  When it's a little sweaty  Do you eat ass?  Fuck it's  Literally it's the first thing I do  Before I get the number  Yeah  Yeah  Eric  Yeah  You have a game  Always going then  Like do you always have  This is the game  I'm playing now  I don't right now  Because I finished  Dead Space 2  A couple weeks ago  Tried Gears of War 3 
[03:40:00]  And after a week  I kind of gave up on that  But how much time  On the weekends  Do you spend?  It's usually at night  So you know  Anywhere from like  8 to  1, 2, 3 in the morning  8pm  On a Friday night?  On a Saturday night  Oh what a terrible night  8pm until 3 in the morning?  Depending on which game  And how involved I'm in it  That's terrible  That's 7 hours  That's not too bad though  Take your chick out for dinner  We do  Finger pop  And then we come home  Wait so you go out for dinner  And you're home by like 
[03:40:30]  8 o'clock  Well we'll go out  During the day  And do stuff  Fucking Nana  Where do you go?  You go and have dinner at 6  You go to Chili's  You go to Chili's  Get the special at 6  You take her to Chili's?  Oh we go to other places too  But we do frequent Chili's  Be home by quarter to 7  Or quarter to 8  Well Chili's does have  Hot Russian waitresses  Well I'm a fan of Chili's  I'm just not a fan  Of coming home by 8 o'clock  So you can spend  Oh when you're on Saturday  When you're out the entire day  And you're like  Fuck it we're just gonna go home  What do you spend your  Yeah but wait  Why don't you go home 
[03:41:00]  And you know  Like Jim says  You know eat an asshole  At the risk of sounding disrespectful  Yeah  Not arguing with that  But yes you are  Cause you say  You spend 7 hours  Playing video games  No I'm not arguing  Doing that  Oh oh  I'm just saying  That's what you know  I'll spend some time  On the weekend playing  Well what does your wife  Think of you  Spending all this time  Playing video games  It depends  Like if she wants to go  Like she'll have a bunch of shows  On the DVR  That she wants to watch  That I have no interest in  She'll go into the bedroom  And watch those 
[03:41:30]  And I'll be in the living room  Playing games  So like on a Saturday night  You and your wife  Go into separate rooms  And watch your televisions  Terrible  That sounds awful dude  That's awful  That really does sound like  That may be the worst  Saturday night  That anybody ever had  It sounds pretty awesome to me  You like it  I love it  You know  She's drinking wine  I'm drinking whatever else I have  Yeah but you're drinking separately  Gravy  Yum  Out of the gravy boats  Pouring it in  Hey I got to level 3  Good job Eric  He's got a fucking two gravy boats 
[03:42:00]  In one of those beer cup hats  That thick gravy just passing through  Those plastic straws  I drink Spottin  Or like Mike's Hard Lemonade  But you like  You just get fucked up  In separate rooms  And watch TV  Or there's times  That we're watching movies together  But for when I go to play games  What does she watch  That you don't like  She likes the Cardassians  She watches  Raising Hope  Your wife is in the bedroom 
[03:42:30]  And you're in the living room  Drinking  Playing Xbox  Playing Portal  What do you snack on  When you're playing Portal  Um  Usually  Well there's Snyder's pretzels  You have those  Snyder's  Does it have to be Snyder's  Yes  The sourdough pretzels  You always say  Snyder's pretzels  Always  You get the big brown box  And don't you also love  The way that he always  Says pretzels first  Because that's like  That's not so bad  Pretzels  Me lost all carbs  Yeah it is all carbs  It's delicious 
[03:43:00]  I know  Especially when you get  To the bottom of the bag  You can lick the pretzel  And just scrape all the salt  Who doesn't do that  I fucking licked the  Fuck  Dude  I had Pumpernickel pretzels  At home last night  Oh those are good too  I was sucking them  And I actually still have  A half bag left  And I was rifling my hand  To the bottom  To get the salt  And then rubbing them  In mustard  I needed my treat  You deserve it  Hard week of work  So  What else do you eat  Cheese nips are good  And uh  I love fucking cheese nips  I had some today  Nabisco cheese nips  Do you ever lick them  And smell them  No  Why 
[03:43:30]  I just never do that  I know you smell everything  But I just  I'll eat it  And uh  Salt and vinegar  Potato chips  Oh so you just have  Your breath is just lovely  By the time you go to bed  Oh my god  Terrible  What do you do  Goggling with coffee  Before you get in the sack  So  That means you  So you're up until like  Three o'clock in the morning  So do you sleep all day  Uh  Get up around twelve  Oh okay  On Sunday  And your wife's the same thing  Yeah she sleeps in two  She doesn't complain about you 
[03:44:00]  Like doesn't she ever say  Why don't we do something together  On a Saturday night  Yeah she does  And when she does  We go and we'll do something  But when  If nothing is said  Then I'm going right to the video game  That's not healthy  He'll do something at his leisure  Yeah yeah  And  I've been working all week  I never have a chance to play these games  Come on  No I don't use that excuse  Why not  Cause that's a bullshit  I'm stressed out  This is a good chance to release for me  Did you hear what  OP did to me this week  Come on 
[03:44:30]  I just want to play Portal  I'm almost done with the game  I'm almost done  Yeah  Do you ever do that  Like do you ever say  That you're  I almost beat the game  I'm almost at the final  Whatever  The final  Whatever it is  Jizz pile  That you get to in Portal 3  I just beat King Koopa  There's almost no one left  Well she likes those games  What games  Mario  Mario  Tetris  Frogger  She's getting Sims 3  The Pets Edition  Sims 3 Pets  What is that  She's just going to pretend 
[03:45:00]  She has dogs  She's just trying  What she's trying to do  Is figure out some game  That she could at least  Stomach  So that she can sort of  Relate to her husband  On some level  She's trying to not  Hate your guts  Exactly  She used to play games  All the time  I know  She's a married woman now  She wants sex  She wants kids  Married women want different things  We're working on that  It would be like Jess  Picking a wrestler  And pretending that she likes that wrestler  Yeah  To be like  Oh I like him  Yeah  It's like no you don't  You're just fed up with me 
[03:45:30]  Every Monday  Every Friday  Every afternoon  Putting this on  Do you watch every Friday?  No  Well I mean I DVR'd on Friday  We usually  I try to  Maintain  A healthy  Social life  Especially when I was doing  I mean  Cause I used to do the  I haven't done the  Saturday night show  In a month  Which has been good  Why not?  Because I got tired  Of coming in every Saturday  For free  You know  Always free?  Yeah  And I just  You know  I wanted to  See what else was going on  And you know  I mean  I just kept doing it 
[03:46:00]  And doing it  And it wasn't  Going anywhere  Like it was a good show  Like Dave and me  Are still having fun  And everything  But you know  It wasn't  Cause I got tired of Dave  Dave's still going in  And doing the show  And he sounds good  But you know  I took some time off  But yeah  Because of that  Like we specifically  Do something on Friday  And Saturday  You know  We can't  Because  And maybe  I don't know  Maybe that's  Why Eric has more Saturdays  To just kind of  Slough off  And throw out  Because  But we go out  During the day  What do you do?  We go shopping 
[03:46:30]  That's not going out  I understand you run errands  But that's not the same  As like  Going out with your wife  On a Saturday night  Well sometimes  She doesn't want to go out either  She goes  Nah let's just stay home  Fine  Let me talk to Donnie  Who's on after  Open Anthony Live  What's up Donnie?  Hey what's going on Sam?  I have to agree with Eric  I'm the same way  You spend  You spend your whole day  With the wife  You know what?  Screw her  I want my own time  I want to play games  You know what? 
[03:47:00]  I've been married  For like eight years  You know what?  You had sex with her  Big deal  I want some new women also  Eric you know  This is the road  You're going down  It's like wearing  The same underwear also  So give Eric a break  Come on  Somebody's feedback  I mean everybody's saying  You know  It's because I haven't been married  But I've been with Jess  For over six years  And you've lived with her  For how long?  Four or five years  Yeah  Like you know  I don't think there's going to be  That much different  When we're married  But Eric you know 
[03:47:30]  You're going down the same route  That Donnie is on  We do stuff together  You run errands together  It's not the same thing  Yeah what you do  Is you go out and get things  To stock up for your time alone  Exactly  You consume together  Yeah  But you don't  Reap the rewards together  Yeah  She gets fucking like  Little things to eat  And you get  Uts pretzels  No no  No Snyder's  And diet bing juice  Or whatever you drink  Cherry Coke Zero  Don't worry  It's Cherry Coke Zero  So I can eat  I can drink 13 cans 
[03:48:00]  Do you like Cherry Coke Zero  And Snyder's pretzels?  Yeah  Cherry Coke Zero  Diet Dr. Pepper  Snyder's pretzels  I mean look  If you have a happy life  More power to you  But  I want Iraq to be happy  I'm fine  I would suggest  Picking up a little something  For your wife  You know what I mean?  Yeah  You gotta make sure  That she's happy  You gotta make sure  That she knows you still care  Well our anniversary  Is coming up  What are you getting her?  You know what I would suggest?  What?  Argentium  Argentium is what you should get her  It's a nice gift  Do you know what that is?  I have no idea 
[03:48:30]  Well  Does anyone know what Argentium is?  I don't know  I'll tell you what it is  Sounds made up  No it's not  It's Steven Singer's new  Super Silver collection  He's got a brand new collection  The king of all silver metals  Argentium  It starts at only $149  Which is nothing  I mean  It's worth  The amount of piece you'll get  From giving jewelry to your girl  Is worth $149  Especially if you're wasting all your time  Playing video games  Exactly  That's the least you could do  Get her some Argentium  It's more pure than sterling silver 
[03:49:00]  It's brighter than platinum white gold  And sterling silver  Very low maintenance  It's not going to tarnish  And it's responsible  It's made of recycled silver  So you're saving the planet  It's an amazing product  Go to IHateStevenSinger.com  Call up 1-888-I-HATE-STEVEN-SINGER  Or visit him in person  At the other corner of 8th and Walnut in Philadelphia  I go in person  When I need to do my business  Because Stephen's there  Leanne is there  Turbo Joe is there  People are there  To take care of you

[03:50:30]  Loving her up  I was very nice to Phoebe  Jim was  At one point we got my mom  On the phone  And I noticed that Phoebe  Fell asleep for almost  The entire segment  Was she sitting in Jim's arms?  No because I don't  I don't want to hold her  I'm afraid of dropping her  What do you  I don't want to drop a baby  Or a dog  Or a small dog  At one point she was  Sitting under Jim's chair  And Jim let out  A real nice gasser  I'm not shocked  She likes that  And then she goes  She wants to get closer  To smell it  She does  She likes that a lot  Yeah Phoebe  You like that?  Does that voice sound familiar? 
[03:51:00]  Yeah  That was really mean  What you did to me the other day  I thought you knew it was me  I didn't know this  What is his name?  Chip?  Chip Chipperson  I never heard of Chip  And all of a sudden  He was saying some nasty things  And I felt as though  I was divulging some  Personal experiences to you guys  Nicole came in here  Was that last week  Or this week?  It might have been Friday  I don't know  Nicole came in here  A few days ago  And she shared with us  The great story  Which I appreciate you doing  Yeah of course you do  Of her fiance  Jizzing in her face  And hitting her in the eye  It was an accident  It was hot  Yeah  It was an accident  I like the fact that 
[03:51:30]  You let him do that  And you say you let him  Come inside too right?  Because you're in a relationship  Well I mean we're going  To get married  Right fair enough  Well I'm on the pill  It's not like I have  Boo  What's wrong with the pill?  When I'm ready to pull the goalie  I'll pull the goalie  But I don't have a baby yet  I got Phoebe right now  Yeah the dog is looking up  Like what are you talking about?  Yeah I just  So it jizzed in your eye  He shot a load right  Why do you have to keep saying it?  Because he shot a load  In your eye  That's what he does  Like you know  You see it in porno movies  You don't hear about it too much  From your co-workers  Yeah you don't  From girls who are respectable 
[03:52:00]  On big shows  Right  Like hey it's me Nicole  From the morning mashup  We have lots of listeners  Families tuning in and everything  By the way  I just caught a load  In my eyeball the other day  That's right  It was an accident  And he apologized  You know  Anywhere but the eye  Is really fine  But the eye  Is a little dangerous  You know  So you'll take it anywhere  Except the eye  Yeah  I had no idea  You had these ground rules  Yeah just not the eye  Would you want it in your eye?  No  I've shot my own in my eye  Right  Ryan was saying that  From our show  He said  By accident  He shot it in his eye  He did that 
[03:52:30]  Jim's also tasted his own  Sure  One girl wanted me to do it on video  On my webcam  So I did  I fucking  I shot it into my hand  And I licked it  And you're not worried about her saving the  Who cares  Mine  I saved it  You still haven't  Let me take a look at that day  I was very dirty  Yeah I was very  I was very naughty  Very saucy  Oh I shouldn't be doing this  I think I even said that  Oh I shouldn't be doing this  I never normally would  But don't tell mother  That's really gross  I know you're telling me  It tastes 
[03:53:00]  We do a girlfriend Jim  Not at the moment  We broke up recently  Oh I'm sorry about that  That's okay  Sorry  What happened was  After Nicole told the story  Of her fiance  Busting a load in her eyeball  Chip called up the after show  And started trying to dirty talk Nicole  Yeah  And Nicole  Stormed out  Was unfamiliar with Chip at the time  She thought it was just a random caller  Yeah she had no idea  That Chip fucking means business  I kept saying  Hang up Sam  Hang up  And you weren't hanging up  And so I didn't know why  And so I walked out  Yeah  I wanted to mash it up you 
[03:53:30]  I really don't like this Chip character  Mash it right up in there  You know  A lot of people hate Chip  A lot of people love Chip  How would you like him?  Who likes him?  Everyone loves me  No actually Chip  A lot of people don't like him  I always make people laugh  No you don't make anybody laugh  Sure I do  Tell Nicole one of your  One liners  I don't know  You're not good on the spot  I don't  I don't  I feel  I feel uncomfortable  Just that I know  That he's about to do a Chip line  I feel uncomfortable  Sitting next to him  Well I mean  It's a nice sweater  What do you have balloons  Under there or something 
[03:54:00]  Chip you're commenting on her breasts  Really Chip  I don't want  I don't like the face  I don't like Chip's face  I don't like his voice  Well Chip also like  He has a lot of anger  I don't know if you know Chip  But like  He thinks he's a comedian  I'm sorry Chip  You are a comedian  Yeah yeah yeah  Dude I'm in a band  Until I sing  I play bass  You play bass?  Yeah  Maracas  You're a rocker  You don't have any  Maracas I said  Oh Maracas  He's got a short fuse  I guess it  I got a big thick fuse  Juicy 
[03:54:30]  Like a big juicy fuse  Nicole you didn't even ask him  About his band  What's your band's name?  The SFPs  It's wartime?  The SFPs  Sick fucking puppies  Oh  Why do you think he's funny?  Why he's fueling his fire Sam?  Well I'm not  I don't think  I think that's a pretty hardcore name  For a band  It's like a heavy metal band?  Yeah I play a little bit of grunge  Grunge or heavy metal?  Yeah some like Irish stuff  Irish stuff?  My fiance's Irish  Do not talk about him like that  That's cool  They say that we got small cocks 
[03:55:00]  But I don't  You don't  That's very charming  You know there's one way  To woo a woman  Is to announce that  They may say I have a small cock  But I don't  Everyone says that  I told that one girl  You're lying bitch  Is that what you told her Chip?  Yes  I was like you're lying  It's a big one  I stuck it in a  I mashed  I mashed it up in a  Okay  Chip have you ever thought about  Doing like a morning show more  I know you keep it hardcore on O&A  But something more like  The morning mashup  Like something that's more family friendly  A little bit of a broader audience 
[03:55:30]  Yeah like broad  Oh my god  I have to go  I gotta go  What type of segment Chip  Would you do on the mashup?  Like what's something  I'll probably say something like  Hey we're gonna play some songs  Or whatever  And you girls wanna come in  And I'll just mash this up  Right inside you  Okay alright  I'll make mashed potatoes in you  Chip how do I know  That this key lime cupcake thing  That I'm gonna try  Is not  Got anything gross in it?  No it doesn't have nothing  Except I key limed in it  I squeezed my juicy key lime  Oh my god  I'm leaving  My boss is gonna kill me 
[03:56:00]  What does that even mean?  Is he gonna be upset what?  Because you're dirty talking with Chip?  Yeah  Or because of the  How much time do we have to roll a desk?  In two minutes  We gotta go like now  Yeah  So why don't you just go now?  So we're not gonna  Just quit  No it's 47  Yeah I know  Cause we got a triple break  Oh  Who brought these little key lime  Paul did  They're good  Oh really?

[03:57:30]  How are you gonna go on  As you say O&A  I'm sure  I'm not that savvy  I've never heard them  No?  Sorry folks  They've heard me though  Right  Cause now I'm a little mad  I woke up  And people were saying  How are you gonna go on that show  After they crapped on you?  And I'm like what?  And this is like  I'm in the car  Going there  And we're running late  You know  New York traffic  And I've got the director  Of the movie  Driving the van  That we've been touring  Around the movie  In 20  I haven't seen LA in a month 
[03:58:00]  We're like driving around the country  And you know  People are still tweeting  You shouldn't do this  And this and that  What were they saying?  I don't even know  Well this is the Opie and Anthony studio  They leave at 10  I'm on that show  And I stay  Because I have to go to the airport  But they were talking about me  As I was on my way there  Before I was late  Well they said  No cause they said  You were running late  It was supposed to be 8.40  But as it got to be 9 o'clock  Cause they told us  You had a hard out at 9 o'clock  No no no no  But I woke up  It was like 7.30 or 8 
[03:58:30]  Way before I was late  And they  What were they saying?  Oh nothing bad before that  Yeah I think  It was about you being late  Yeah no Opie  At the very top of the show  Said something like  Why are we having Andy Dick in?  Yeah  Oh in the beginning  But he's probably said that  About half the guests  Honestly  And Jim you're  But that's his thing right?  Like on this trip  I pick up the local paper  Cause it's always free  In the hotel  And there was one local paper  That had an article  About the local DJ  And the local DJ 
[03:59:00]  Had been ripped a new asshole  By Opie and Anthony  Because I guess they do this thing  Jocktober  Yeah yeah yeah  Right and they pick  They pick one local DJ  Or I don't really know  How it works  But the  Awful radio all over the country  Just hack radio  And they ripped this woman  This team  It was a guy and a girl  Right right right  They ripped them to shreds  To the point where  They're very upset about it  Yes they got  And there's whole articles  In their local paper  And they were crying  She said she cries herself to sleep  And like  I mean if that 
[03:59:30]  If people like this kind of radio  It's all fun and games  Yeah of course  Cause it's  The bottom line is  Until somebody commits suicide  Well they should  For the radio they're doing  That's bad radio  Yeah  Come on man  You have a comic  You've been on a million  Of those shows  They're terrible  They're awful  I don't know  But don't talk to me  About bad radio  And then what's going on  Like  I was excited to  I come in  Yes I'm a little bit late  Let's you know  Bring it  Let me come in a little late  They wouldn't have me on at all  It was kind of weird  That would have been  Some good radio  I think so 
[04:00:00]  It would have been  Some good radio  I was ready to go  They had you in here now  Thank you  Cause you're not afraid  No they're not  Believe me  It wasn't a fear thing  What's up  They were annoyed  They were annoyed  They felt that like  You have a reputation  For being late  And they're like  You're not going to do  It's not true at all  I'm just telling you  What they said  Because it was 840  Was when we were told  That you were going to come in  Yeah  And then the note that I got  Was that you were here  Not until 917  And nobody was responding  Nope  To the publicist  We heard that they weren't responding  I don't have a publicist  Or whoever it was  And we were calling in  To Spencer 
[04:00:30]  Yeah  And the lines were down  You guys  You know that  About your whole system here  Everything was down  There was no one  We were calling  Saying we're coming  We're coming  We're in traffic  We can't park  They dropped me off  I was up here  I was just up there  Just wandering around  So it's not  I'm not to blame  There's no one to blame  And you guys were still  They were still on the air  When I was here  I was just standing here  Doing nothing  I said well at least  Let me walk by the window  And wave and show them  That I'm a fucking normal guy  I'm not here to fuck them over 
[04:01:00]  I'm here to have some fun  And bring it  Yeah  If they hate me  For some fucking reason  Tell me why  I want to talk to them  Sure  You know  Are you sure  It's not a fear thing  Because I'm right here  Let me guarantee you  I'm ready to go  I'm on the show every day  I'm guaranteed  A hundred percent  Tell them  Tell them that I had  They're not afraid  I couldn't wait to talk to them  About this incident  That happened  Where they made this woman  Cry herself to sleep every night  Okay  And I can't remember what city  But I will guarantee you  I wanted to talk about it  And I wanted to see  What they were saying  Maybe it was a knee jerk reaction 
[04:01:30]  Because they were like  Well if he doesn't want to come  Because don't forget  You've never been on the show  And they're like  Look he's not going to come on time  Fine  No big deal  But we'll just take that  As he's not interested  In being on the show  I am  I'm right here  Doing the fucking after show  But we were trying to call  I'm doing the after show  And your guys weren't getting back to us  What guy  Whoever they  I don't have a publicist  Whoever they were calling  Who are you  I don't know  I was on the air  There's no publicist  So I don't know who you're talking about  Can I have my cell phone number  I'm an open book  Can I have your number  Yes  We'll talk  I'm serious  We'll text each other  Yes  I send talk photos 
[04:02:00]  The other thing is  Is that I'm on Twitter  All my interactions  And all my correspondences  And all my conversations  Are completely open and public  You could have tweeted me  Saying where the fuck are you  Well Roland was trying to call somebody  Because I had all my fans saying  Why are you doing that show  They're crapping on you  Roland said  You know what  That's why I'm going to do it  So they get to know the guy  None of your guys  None of your guys  Were coming back  Roland just said  We were told  Nobody from you guys  Was getting back to us  The emails were in return  We were calling  We were calling  The switchboard was out  Do you guys know that 
[04:02:30]  Can you back me up on that  The switchboard was out  We were calling you  It was going right to voicemail  Was the switchboard out  No calls were going through  Okay  No calls were going through  No one told us that  Yeah  I swear to God  I mean we believe you now  And I'm here now  Why would I want to be doing the after show  I don't know you guys  I was excited  I'm happy that we can clear it up  But I wanted to meet these guys  That made this woman cry  In whatever city I was in  Well we've  And I mean  We didn't  Our intention wasn't  To make somebody cry  But I mean you've said  Nasty things about people too  Yeah  Well 
[04:03:00]  No you're talking about Howard  That  No I mean Howard  The Howard thing  I mean you said it  I don't say nasty things  To people unless I've  Unless somebody talks about me  And to me  And about me first  As a comedian  You never  Never  I don't do that  I'm not the Kathy Griffin  Okay  You know  The male  Well she could be the Kathy Griffin  She  Look I don't do that  I just don't do that  If somebody says something  Or is a certain way to me  I take that as a license  Like okay  Well you asked for it  Like that's how it is 
[04:03:30]  And Howard  I've known him for 25 years  He  Has  I've taken it like a champ  In the fucking face  From him  And he is  Has always been a friend  When the mics go off  We're so sweet to each other  We love each other  But when the mics are on  You know  All's fair  In love  And war  And he has called me  Every name in the book  And I take it  Water off a dick's back  As I say  And you know  And then this fight  We had this thing  Where I started  Getting worked up 
[04:04:00]  And I'm like  Oh the mics are on  Let's go  Like I'm doing now  You know  You're doing it for listeners  You want people to tune in  Oh Andy's a little riled up  There's something  There must be sugar  In his gas tank  You know  That doesn't make sense  No it doesn't  Yeah you're all ramped up  But yeah you're ramped up  Let's keep listening  But really I'm just doing it  I'm not really ramped up  I don't really care  I don't really care  I don't know  Who Opie and Anthony are  I don't know  I only know them  Through this 
[04:04:30]  Incident that happened  In one city  Where they made  This disc jockey cry  And I'm like  God  What did they say  To make someone cry  Well I mean  We spent  Probably an hour  Just going through their tapes  And saying how bad they were  At their jobs  Do you remember  What city it was?  I don't remember  Because I got  Somebody sent me the article  Iowa  I think it might have been Iowa  Or Idaho  Idaho  Idaho  Idaho  And to the point  Where they shut  They also  Had to shut down  Their Facebook 
[04:05:00]  Well yeah  Part of that  Was our fans  The fans  They're brutal  Well there was  Oh I remember now  And this  This is where  You know  I think it does  Cross the line  Where  And it wasn't  Opie or Anthony  But it was  One of your fans  One of those  DJs  Has a  Retarded  Yeah  We saw that  And they said  Something about  I don't remember  Exactly  That is kind of  Fucked up  Yeah  We didn't say  Make fun of the  Retarded kid 
[04:05:30]  We didn't even know  That there was  A kid to speak of  We were making fun  Of their work  Of their show  One of the fans  Said something about  I don't remember  Exactly what  But it was  Like one of those  Well they get  Very defensive  And we're upset  You know  Sometimes they  Overdo it  But why are we  But you're upset  You're just upset  That they  That they suck  We're upset  Because in that  Climate  Which is so bad  Now that is what  Survives  Well exactly  It's more of an  Attack on the  Industry  Than the specific  Show  It's just 
[04:06:00]  The show is the  One that has to  Take the brunt  And follow  Oh god  You're not even  Hitting the one  We've been doing  This tour for this  Movie  We're going into  Well what's the  You should be able  To plug the movie  The movie is called  Division  That's why we're here  I wanted to  Really meet  Opie and Anthony  And see what  Their beef is with me  Well are you in town  No we're leaving  Today  We did this  We had the premiere  Last night  This is an afterthought  Like let's go and  We talk about the movie  Even though the premiere  Was last night  It goes to  Video on demand  November 18th  It's a football comedy  But what was I 
[04:06:30]  What was I going to say  About that  You were talking about  What's the name  Of the movie  No I was going to  Talk about that  We've been on tour  With Division 3  Showing the movie  To colleges  Little tiny towns  And we have gone  Into stations  Where it's one  Mike  That has  Duck tape  All over it  And there's water  Damage  And rat  Turds  And there are  Stations out there  That are just  Scraping by  Yeah  That you wouldn't 
[04:07:00]  Believe it  In some of these  Towns  Like  But our thing  Was more on the  Content  Of what they were  Doing on the air  Is terrible  Same with  Same  I mean the content  Is just as  Good as their  Facilities  I mean I'm talking  About they  Oh my god  It was the local  Television thing  And it was  Like that Tim and  Eric episode  Where I had to  Hold my  Lavalier mic  And there was like  Do you know what I'm  Saying  It's so bad 
[04:07:30]  God bless them  Though  They're trying  In terms of  What happened  Today  I mean we  Definitely didn't  Attack you  It doesn't seem  Like you two did  But trust me  If they were  I would have too  This guy over here  Paul he's a  Non-Anthony  He doesn't exist  And it wasn't  A fear thing  Believe me  Because they like  Confrontation a lot  They must love it  And I don't  And I don't mind it  And I was excited  To see them  And put all  Rumors to rest  Because it's not  True that I'm  Always late 
[04:08:00]  And this and that  I'm not  But you understand  That like  You know we had you  They said he's got  A heart out at 9 o'clock  So we say okay  8.40 to 9 o'clock  We have Andy Dick  Well I didn't make up  That heart out  I have a heart on  For Opie and Anthony  That's what we're told  That's what we're told  Because you've got  A bunch of stuff to do  So when it's 9.15  You know we got  Other stuff that  We were going to do  I get it  You know  Well I hope I can  Come on and  What do they even  Look like  I don't even  I know nothing  One is blonde  The one who's  Opie is blonde  And he's got like  Washboard abs
