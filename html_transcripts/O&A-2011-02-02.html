<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton's characteristically self-deprecating introductions, acknowledging their history of FCC violations and the show's often crude humor.  Initial technical difficulties with a replay were jokingly blamed on a "wintry mix of Opie and Anthony bits."  Their guest, Eric Nagel, was introduced and playfully held responsible for the technical issues.  The conversation then turned to the severe ice storm impacting several states, prompting satirical commentary on overly cautious news coverage.  The hosts darkly joked about a news story concerning a man found dead in his car, seemingly by suicide.  Listener calls followed, providing updates on the storm's effects on travel.

Zsa Zsa Gabor's death was discussed with vulgar and disrespectful commentary regarding her age and appearance.  This led to a debate about the authenticity of a rumored suggestive remark she allegedly made to Johnny Carson, referencing Snopes.com for verification.  The Egyptian protests against President Mubarak were a significant topic, with the hosts sharing their opinions and speculating on potential outcomes, including the Muslim Brotherhood's role and US government involvement.  Further discussion covered Charlie Sheen's substance abuse struggles, the aftermath of the Tucson shooting, and Groundhog Day, met with sarcastic and irreverent jokes about Punxsutawney Phil.  Finally, the hosts discussed Freaknik, sharing personal anecdotes and listener calls, interspersed with more crude humor and banter.  Jane Fonda and her controversial past were also mentioned.

A caller identifying himself as "Tarbash, the Egyptian magician" described his bizarre magic act involving fire, self-mutilation (implied), and animals.  The hosts then discussed Christy Brinkley's birthday and speculated on older women wearing hats.  They debated an upcoming American Idol apology, guessing it was for a physically disabled contestant or omitting Taylor Hicks from a montage, expressing strong dislike for Hicks.  Live footage from Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, showed Punxsutawney Phil not seeing his shadow, predicting an early spring, a fact the hosts found ironic given the blizzard.  They expressed disdain for the Groundhog Day tradition.  A video of children bullying another child was shown, prompting disgusted yet humorous comments from the hosts, comparing past and present bullying experiences.  This led to sharing embarrassing childhood anecdotes, including prank calls (one host admitted to calling the White House with a bomb threat), misinterpreting song lyrics, and a failed fishing attempt.  A caller, Bill, recounted a high school prank involving a boombox and the air conditioning system.  The show concluded with a segment on "Black Tweets," featuring a racially offensive tweet, and complaints about their exclusion from a Super Bowl broadcast, blaming internal mismanagement and poor service from All Island Taxi.  A Sirius XM promo for Super Bowl coverage was mysteriously replaced mid-play by another promo, leading to speculation of sabotage.

Another segment began with Opie detailing a negative experience with a cab company.  The conversation then shifted to Mayor Michael Bloomberg's alleged gun purchase investigation in Arizona, with the hosts and a caller, "Poop Smears," expressing skepticism and anger.  A video clip showed the hosts' and Mars' reactions to Jennifer Lopez walking past their studio, with Mars' exuberant response ("Bang!") becoming a source of relentless ribbing.  This led to a discussion about body types and preferences.  Uncle Nino performed a stand-up routine filled with crude jokes.  The movie *Exit Through the Gift Shop* was discussed, focusing on Banksy's identity and the film's authenticity.  Footage of the Egyptian protests was shown, highlighting the shift from peaceful protests to violent clashes.  The show ended with continued discussion of *Exit Through the Gift Shop*.  Victoria Gotti and Mike Rowe were mentioned as previous guests (with Rowe's appearance cut short by Gotti's segment).

A lengthy interview with Steven Singer, a jeweler, featured crude humor about race, sexuality, and appearance.  Singer discussed his Valentine's Day sales, marketing strategy, and a trivia contest offering gift cards.  His attractive assistant, Leanne, was discussed with sexually suggestive comments.  The hosts also discussed Ancestry.com and their genealogy research.  Singer described his work and hobbies. The segment concluded with a promo for Uncle Nino's Bad Jokes and Wine, containing more offensive and sexually explicit humor.  News of the Yemeni leader's decision not to seek re-election and continued protests in Cairo were briefly mentioned.  The hosts again expressed negativity towards Groundhog Day.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  Here we go. Here's the bit.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I would love to say we have the best job in America.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  It could be the best thing ever.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  Out loud laughs.  How do we explain the show?  We should start there.  Oh, here it is.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show, a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment and having very few limits. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, shit. This is a freak show.  Why would anybody want to come on this show as a guest?  Under the right circumstances, something weird could happen.  I don't give a fuck.  Laugh out loud funny.  Which I love. That's what I love.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  When you listen to our show, you know what you get.  You know what we are.  Everything has to do with cock or balls.  No, the jokes all end up talking about cock and balls.  You're a waste of life. 
[00:01:00]  Fucking listeners, go fucking die.  Excuse me.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Wow.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  How's everybody?  It got a little weird there at 6 a.m.  Well, I guess this doesn't matter because people are hearing this on the replay. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, they don't care.  Just a bunch of fuck-ups to start today's show.  It was a little mishy-moshy at the beginning with the replay.  Ah, whatever.  Fuck it.  It doesn't mean much to the people that listen on the replay.  You know what it was?  It was a wintry mix.  It was a wintry mix of Opie and Anthony bits.  A wintry mix.  That made absolutely no sense.  So I'm yanking this one, and then they put another one in.  No, that doesn't work either.  It changed over to another thing.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  And then it'll continue for a while, and then it'll change to complete Opie and Anthony later 
[00:02:00]  in the day.  And it wasn't even a nageling.  But then it ended up as a nageling.  It ended up as a nagel.  But what are you going to do?  Somebody else was fucking up, so we sent in nagel to take care of the situation.  Yeah.  And guess what?  It turned out to be a nageling.  Yeah.  In the end.  That's like sending in vinegar to help a burn victim.  Exactly.  Our guest today is the very obese and clumsy Eric Nagel.  Eric, please tell the audience what you did wrong now.  I'm cooperating here. 
[00:02:30]  Eric, when we play that clip, that means get on mic and answer Jerry Springer's question.  Hey, niggas.  Hi, Eric.  You rock.  Hello.  Hi, Eric.  Thanks for the energy, too, by the way.  It's wonderful.  I love the energy.  Keep it up.  We're all tired, but we fucking fake it on a daily basis.  Ice day today.  It's an ice day.  It's an ice day.  And it isn't even that bad out.  I mean, it's pretty icy, pretty slippery.  It's bad, but it's winter and you get shit happening. 
[00:03:00]  But it's not one of those crazy ice storms where, like, fucking two inches of ice build up on branches and bring down power lines and all that shit.  It's not everything.  And I'm talking about our area, so I'm being local.  Well, but northwest of us, they got more ice, more snow, shit like that.  Oh, man, this thing.  And then this one from Chicago got hammered.  Chicago all the way down to Dallas.  This thing kicked the shit out of the country.  I think 33 states were affected by this storm.  Yeah, a lot of airport closings.  That's unbelievable. 
[00:03:30]  A lot of airport closings.  But we have â€“ I guess we talk for all the news stations out there.  They're just a bunch of assholes.  They talk like they're from the future or something.  The future?  They may believe they're from the future.  And they're giving us knowledge that we need to know right now.  They had a reporter on ice.  Yeah, it's an ice storm.  So the sidewalks and the streets are very slippery.  And they're like, it's slippery.  So, see, watch what happens to me here. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, I know.  We all know.  When they take that camera and Panda, she goes, look, look, if I get a shot down here,  if you look at the road, see, this is all ice.  Yeah.  And she's touching it.  And, like, she goes, this is all ice.  This is covering the road.  And if you look at my car, you'll see ice on the windows, ice on the windshield.  Right.  Give yourself some extra time to melt this off before you drive it.  Why?  Really?  Why are you telling us this?  Really?  Why?  Are you from the future and we don't know?  I was darting out in fucking patent leather shoes with leather soles on them running to 
[00:04:30]  my car, which I jumped in and just gassed it.  There you go.  She goes, you might need a de-icer and you might want to, you know, turn on your heat  and your, uh, uh, uh, should I defrost it?  Yeah, defrost and all that for at least a half hour.  They give you the time like you're baking a fucking pie.  Give it a half hour.  And do it in your garage with the door closed and you're in the vehicle.  Please do that.  And then she's banging on a street sign. 
[00:05:00]  Look what the ice storm has done to the street sign.  And she's pounding on it and nothing's happening.  I guess she was hoping for a big moment with the whole, where the whole sign.  Yeah.  The ice falls off the sign.  I don't know.  They're all looking for their dramatic moment.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know what use it serves.  Uh, they have nothing else to talk about.  They hype up things also.  Um, they did make this sound worse than it is or, and, and made it sound like it was 
[00:05:30]  going to be worse.  But even when it's bad, I don't understand.  I just don't understand why they spend so much time reporting on obvious basic shit about  it.  Like the weather should be, look, man, we're going to get a foot of snow and you know what  that means.  So good luck to you.  That's all you need.  You know what that's, that's all you need.  You don't need to run to them.  Uh, yeah, that could be wrong.  I'm thinking about Patrice going to Houston.  Like, I wonder if that plane takes off today.  Why don't we call Patrice in a little while and see where he's at, but a lot of delays.  Actually, uh, again, uh, my, my, my house guests, uh, cannot leave, uh, even today. 
[00:06:00]  The first flight they can get back to, um, LA, uh, is, um, I think tomorrow.  So that's a, that's a party.  Keep the party going.  I don't care.  Keep the party going.  Well, that's yeah.  The airports are just, uh, shut down.  So, but I, I, look, she's this dumb bitch is just talking about it.  There's nothing to say.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Right.  Yeah.  Obviously it's going to be slippery today in the New York area. 
[00:06:30]  It is.  Yeah.  But people know that they've been driving a while.  They're like, Oh, I know what this is.  Okay.  We get one or two of these a season.  Yeah.  All right.  So it's, it's this today.  Okay.  Don't take out the Shelby.  Yeah.  Don't take out the Shelby.  Exactly.  That's what you do.  Exactly.  And we've had so much, um, snow in the New York area.  The, it's the best story of the day.  I want to jump right into it.  They found a dead guy in a car.  I know.  Holy shit.  How great is that?  Dead guy in the car.  Dead guy decides, uh, well, before he's dead. 
[00:07:00]  Pre-dead.  Pre-dead.  Decides, I fucking hate my life.  I'm going to fucking eat a shotgun.  So he's got a parked car and he eats a shotgun.  Yeah.  And I guess, I guess then it proceeds to snow like it has, you know, I don't know which storm  this was and it covered his car.  Yep.  They just found him yesterday.  They plowed him in and everything.  So he was covered with snow.  He's one of those, he was in one of those cars where you can't even tell there's a car  there because this, you know, the plows that come through so many times.  And now with the, the wintry mix, like Ann said, it's like very crusty and really hard 
[00:07:30]  to even, you know, uncover your car.  Well, they found him yesterday, a week later.  How creepy would that be like at night, all quiet and he's just like fucking dead there  with his eyes just open in the quiet fucking car waiting, waiting for his wake.  Yeah.  You wonder if he stinks or no, probably cause the cold, he probably didn't really buy.  I don't know.  There were a couple of days that probably weren't below freezing and yeah, I'm sure the cold  probably helped though.  Yeah.  It's not like it was a summer day.  That would have, what a great story though. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  I think they're saying they're not, they're not saying how they found him, whatever that  means.  I don't know.  We had no head.  Oh yeah.  Probably.  A little bit of snow melted off the window and somebody was like, what the, oh geez.  Yeah.  I look like fucking the Pulp Fiction car.  That is a shit.  I shot Marvin in the face.  That is a great story though.  Yeah.  Like I, uh, Oh yeah, this is Godspeed to you.  Steve on Long Island.  Steve.  Yes.  Yes.  Good morning.  Good morning, Steve.  The best thing about this weather is crash your fucking car, but Ooh, Oh, the trees look 
[00:08:30]  pretty.  Boo.  Yeah.  The news likes pointing out how the trees look nice and yeah.  But, but be careful on the roads and, and, uh, you know, the ice is also on the power lines.  I never would have known that unless I, I thought it had missed the power lines cause  they're so thin.  Yeah.  Thanks for telling us that future person.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A few persons of the future giving us information, information from the future from the future.  Yeah.  It was, uh, what could they, what could the weather actually tell us that would be important? 
[00:09:00]  A tsunami hitting New York, obviously that every, every fucking speck of snow was radiated,  radiated.  That would suck.  That would be very helpful.  Radioactive snow would really be bad, but there's nothing in a snowstorm.  They could tell us that we kind of don't already know.  What if it only looked like snow, but it weighed as much as a neutron star drop?  Oh God, it's just going right through you.  It just, it goes right through your body instantly.  I'd want to know about that.  Sure.  Yeah.  It's a snowflake, but it's 400 tons. 
[00:09:30]  Be careful.  Called the Nagel flake.  Eric, I didn't say that.  Eric is just going to burst.  Eric is just looking.  I don't mean, you know that.  I just mean out of anger.  You shouldn't let someone else do his job.  Oh shit.  Oh shit, man.  When he rock, when he rock, he could solve half his problems if he, if he wanted to.  He chooses to go there too.  Yeah.  When he rock leaves his job, it's going to be taken out in cuffs, feeling relieved yet  facing life in prison. 
[00:10:00]  A bunch of dead people.  Well, at least you guys will have a chance to run because I know who he's going after  first.  Yeah, Sam.  Probably Sam, right?  Sam will get it first.  Who would you go after first, Iraq?  Iraq?  I thought it was a guarantee that I'm on the top of the list, but would you go for Sam first?  Yeah.  I think Sam's going to be a talk to first.  Talk to.  I like how you put that.  Who's second?  That I think is a free for all.  Whoever's next to him. 
[00:10:30]  Then it's just fucking every man for himself.  I love it.  See, that's why I don't try too hard to like befriend people at work.  Because if you're not the number one guy that they're not going after, that doesn't  matter.  He's got his primary target and then the rest is just going to be like craziness.  Yeah.  He's going to go after that one he really hates and then it doesn't matter at that point.  You might as well just keep shooting.  What's the difference at that point, right?  Oh, Iraq.  Yeah, but tornadoes, I guess. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  If they know there's a tornado coming, that's important for the weather girl to tell you about.  And we're trying to get Dorothy going so we can warn people.  Even hurricanes.  Even hurricanes you don't even really have to like spend too much time on because they're  so slow moving.  They're slow.  By the time they hit you, you know they've been coming.  Yeah.  So weather, the headline today, weather on the news is just a complete waste of time  after about 10, 15 seconds.  Who needs it? 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  A quick headline.  Boom.  Rain today.  Yeah.  You don't even need to say, so you're going to need your rain gear.  We know that.  No.  You're not going to walk out and go like, oh, shit.  Right.  Oh, fuck.  I wish someone told me.  Because you didn't know, you're going to be like, oh, let me grab a raincoat.  Right.  It's raining.  The driving was a little rough, though.  It was a little slippery on the secondary streets.  The highway's not too bad.  Pretty wet.  But the people, they panic, you know?  They get a little panicky Pete in them, and they don't want to really move. 
[00:12:00]  So you've got to make moves, which makes it a little more dangerous.  Just get out of the left lane.  Or just stay home.  If you can't handle the weather, stay home, man.  Stay home.  Is Zsa Zsa Gabor dead?  Why is she trending today?  Do they take another leg?  They're lopping limbs off.  She's vomiting blood.  Yeah.  She may have had a stroke.  It's bad if you have a stroke, and they aren't sure if you did.  Yeah.  What kind of shape were you in before?  They don't know if it's your stroke or your leg stump rotting.  Poor Zsa Zsa. 
[00:12:30]  Zsa Zsa.  She must not be fun to fuck these days.  Why do you have to go out that way?  Why do you have to go out that way?  Piece by piece.  Piece by piece, really?  Yep.  Being mailed off to heaven.  They really are just fucking cutting her up and letting her hang in there.  What's making her hang in there?  Like, some people just, they're sick, and then they're dead.  That's just the body.  She's just hanging in there for no reason.  She probably hasn't had a real...  What?  Nah, not really.  But you remember being young on all those talk shows. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, and she was full of, like, guff.  She sure was.  Wasn't she the one that smacked the cop?  I believe so, yeah.  There was Zsa Zsa and Ava.  Ava Gabor was the one from Green Acres.  Green Acres, right.  And Zsa Zsa was the one that, yeah, slapped the cop.  Zsa Zsa was just known.  Because that goes...  You want to know how many years ago that is?  How long ago is that shit?  When did Zsa Zsa slap the cop, which I remember like it was yesterday.  I'm going to guess 20 years.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to go with 20 years ago.  Are you saying 20 fucking years?  I'm going to go 20 fucking years. 
[00:13:30]  I'm going to say...  She was born in 1917.  She's 93.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to say...  What does that give us?  91, right?  1991.  Come on.  Give it to me.  Wow.  More.  What?  Further back?  Holy shit.  89?  89.  She smacked that cop.  That's 22 years?  22 years ago.  22 years ago.  She smacked that cop. 
[00:14:00]  She's a cunt.  She is.  No.  Well, she is.  But she doesn't have one anymore.  They just removed it.  Yeah.  She sneezed and fell off.  I just shot out like a water balloon.  Yeah.  They thought it was two snails.  But she was a cunt, I remember.  I never really liked her.  Because I just thought she was an entitled twat.  You know what?  What was she fucking famous for?  Exactly.  For being like a bitch.  She was famous for being kind of a bitch.  Wasn't she one of Merv's girls?  And I say...  Oh, yeah.  Quotations. 
[00:14:30]  Merv liked having them around.  Huh?  She said Paris Hilton in the sense that just like these socialites that don't really do much.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ava Gabor was at least in Green Acres.  Ava was in Green Acres.  What is Zha Zha most famous for?  Slapping a cop.  I guess career-wise.  Uh...  Yeah, but getting married to fucking men.  Rich men and then fucking them over in divorce cases.  I really think that's what she's known for.  That was her thing?  I think that's her thing.  Like, how did she get on TV and famous?  She must have...  She must have a pussy made of silk then, man. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  Ah, and then what she...  Did she used to do Hollywood Squares?  Yeah, but Danny's looking at her film on...  Oh, did she act?  Okay, yeah.  Yeah, but there's...  Oh, yeah, right, right.  Yeah, but her last film was in 1953, I think.  No.  She's got, uh...  She was in a Very Brady sequel.  She was in...  Oh, a cameo in a Very Brady sequel.  The Beverly Hillbillies.  Yeah, obviously just a bunch of shit.  Hold on, but most of her stuff comes up to the 60s.  She was in Dream Warriors?  Like 66, 67, 72. 
[00:15:30]  I don't recognize one of those films.  There are the joke cameo appearances that she made after that.  So, uh, before that, she was just in, like, bad old movies.  She's like a B actress.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She stinks.  But she's trending today, so...  They took a leg, but I thought they took a leg last week.  Well, that was all...  That wasn't even cheating.  That was just because the payment was late.  They threatened to take a leg in the head.  Did they take another leg?  That's what I want to know.  Uh, I don't think...  I think it's one leg that they...  I thought they did this last week, though. 
[00:16:00]  She's one leg down.  One to go.  Why?  Did they say they took another leg, or did they say she had a stroke?  I think she was coughing up blood.  Yeah.  She had an infection or something.  But her husband comes blood, so he said it was no problem.  It was actually a funny little twist.  The husband is the guy from our famous clip.  Yeah.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy.  Yeah.  Oh, that was the husband, right?  That's the husband of Zhaja.  What was his name?  Prince?  He had some weird name, right?  Prince.  Something Vaughn.  Prince Vaughn asshole.  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know. 
[00:16:30]  She's...  No, we'll know his name when we hear it.  She's pretty much...  End of story.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's over for Zhaja very quickly.  Uh-oh.  It's snowing lavender now.  Yes.  Damn it.  Frederick Prince Vaughn Enholt.  Enholt.  Yeah, I knew it sounded like asshole.  Enholt.  Asshole.  Whatever.  It's snowing lavender.  I'm going to make the joke again.  Because that is a...  What is that?  A mix?  A wintry mix?  It's just...  I don't know.  It's dumping lavender right now. 
[00:17:00]  And a little green is going to dump.  And some blues.  Some blue up top.  Some blues up top.  No, those aren't actual...  The color of snow.  That's actually...  Oh, literal meteorologist Jim.  The other...  Zhaja was one of...  On Carson.  Oh, okay.  That was her.  I always thought that was Raquel Welsh.  Let's go, Paul.  I think it's urban legend.  I don't know.  I think we did this bit.  I don't think it happened.  Paul, go ahead.  Wasn't Zhaja Gabor the one that was on Carson?  She had that cat.  Johnny asked her if he could pet her pussy. 
[00:17:30]  You remember that?  That's bullshit.  I doubt that ever happened.  That's urban myth.  I don't...  Based on something that was said that wasn't nearly as...  I don't know, man.  I remember seeing the clip, and I think it was Raquel Welsh.  I would guess that she said pussy.  She might have said, like, do you want to pet my pussy, or do you want to...  This is my...  Here's my pussy.  Here we go.  We're snoping.  Hey, Carson.  We haven't snoped in a while.  Made a risque remark to a starlet who appeared on Tonight Show with a cat on her lap.  Status false.  Oh!  Sorry, Paul.  Zhaja Gabor was a frequent visitor on the Carson couch. 
[00:18:00]  As the tale has it, she once came on carrying a cat, which she held in her lap.  She said...  She has said to have asked Carson, would you like to pet my pussy?  He fabled...  His fabled reply was, I'd love to, but you'll have to remove that damn cat.  The origin...  What really happened?  The inconsistency of detail found in Reptish...  Also been told to be Raquel Welch and Margaret, Diane Cannon, which... 
[00:18:30]  Dakota Fanning.  And Farrah Fawcett Majors, among others.  What was the...  Wow, it's so...  It's such an urban legend, I would swear that I saw the clip.  That's how crazy...  There's a line, Danny, can you go up a little bit?  There's one line here where they really nailed what it was.  Oh, really?  They'll go up a little higher to where they were.  It says right there... 
[00:19:00]  He said...  They said, and her cat is a wellspring for one of the greatest manufactured memories in modern pop culture.  Wow.  I think that there's like...  People have those, like...  You've heard it so many times, you do think that you saw the clip.  That you think you actually saw it.  I would have sworn I saw that clip.  Yeah.  And it was Raquel Welch.  Some are saying it was Jane Fonda.  Yeah.  Jimmy Buffo was Jane Fonda.  It didn't happen, people.  It wasn't Jane Fonda.  There was something that happened, because I remember watching recently...  Danny perusing Netflix. 
[00:19:30]  So were you last night.  Oh, hey.  We'll get into that in a second.  What a wrap set.  I didn't forget.  What were you saying, Dan?  Yeah, there was something that happened where a cat was mentioned, and there was...  It was eluded that a pussy, some kind of pussy fucking thing...  That's what Snopes was saying, then.  Nothing happened, anything?  No, no.  It wasn't even close to that, though.  I was trying to cut and paste it, but for some reason Snopes isn't letting me do that.  But it says, even if Johnny Carson had made the quip attributed to him, it could not possibly 
[00:20:00]  have made it onto the air.  Tonight Show was never broadcast live during the Carson years, always taped earlier.  Yeah.  So...  Yeah.  But I thought it would have never made it past the standards of practices.  I thought the quip snuck out.  Never.  Never would have made it.  He might have made it...  You know, Carson was so brilliant, he might have made some kind of a quick allusion to  her saying something about the cat, and he might have said something about another  name.  There was probably some line that happened.  Yeah.  Scroll down a little further and see if there's skeptics.  Sometimes point, the influence of a celebrity bring along a small pet. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  I mean, it's like, who's bringing the cat?  It didn't happen.  It just didn't happen.  Can I pet you?  And people are going to be like, I saw it.  I think there's a lot of people saying that right now.  Well, you're idiots.  You didn't see it.  How about that?  You probably thought...  You probably heard it once.  You didn't want to sound like the parrot that you are.  So you said you saw it.  You've been telling people that.  Yeah.  And you're afraid they're going to hear this and realize that you're a true ass.  Is that you're phony?  All right, man.  You are.  A phony baloney.  All right, man.  You're hurting me. 
[00:21:00]  Not you.  I was one of those guys.  I was so one of those guys.  So fucking pet the pussy.  I would have sworn.  As long as you get it off of your cunt.  Oh, here we go.  He never said that either.  No, he didn't.  Let's go to Nate in Hoboken.  Nate.  All right.  I have the Carson DVDs.  He's talking to Jane Fonda, and Jane Fonda brings up the story.  So Carson tells the story to Jane Fonda, but nowhere is it ever aired that he did actually  say that to her with Zha Zha. 
[00:21:30]  But he is absolutely speaking to Jane Fonda about it.  I have it on the DVD.  Okay.  That's what I saw.  Can we find this?  Probably.  He tells...  Yeah, let's try to find this.  He tells Jane Fonda the story.  Because Jane Fonda asked him, isn't it true that this happened?  Right.  And she says it, and he goes, no, that never happened.  And then they kind of tell the story.  Oh, there it is.  Look at the goddamn day.  Yeah, we...  1989, Jane Fonda is on the Carson show, and they're talking about this incident.  Maybe it did happen, but they never aired it, because obviously you can't air something 
[00:22:00]  like that.  No, it never happened.  But Jane Fonda thought it happened.  Here's Jane Fonda from 1989.  Last night, my son...  You know, you were talking about Zha Zha Gabor earlier.  Yeah, I think everybody's talking about it.  My son said, you know, she was on Johnny Carson's show one time.  She came there with a cat on her lap, and she said to you, do you want to pet my pussy?  And my son said that you said, I'd love to if you'd remove that damn cat. 
[00:22:30]  Can't believe that made the art.  I know.  That's amazing.  That's amazing.  I tell you, I...  Is it true?  No, I think I would recall that.  Wow, you know what?  The jar of Mendoza. 
[00:23:00]  What the fuck?  All the people that said they saw it, I can kind of understand why people would say they  saw it, so I was...  Seeing Jane Fonda relay the story without it being cut, okay, but it never happened, but  now it has almost happened.  Yeah, I could see someone remembering that and thinking they saw it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I remember that.  That was the accurate person.  Now, a few years go by and you're thinking Jane Fonda had the cat on her lap.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jane Fonda had it on her lap.  All right, well.  I don't want Netflix. 
[00:23:30]  Why does Stokes want to send me to Netflix?  I don't want it.  Oh, boy.  I have it.  You have it?  I do.  Hey, Mubarak.  It's named Mubarak.  What's wrong with this asshole?  He doesn't really want to leave.  Well, they're going to drag him out.  It's going to be uncomfortable when they drag out the...  A Mussolini hanging by the heels.  Yeah.  They're going to drag out this old man and it's going to get ugly.  He has a chance to go to the Caribbean.  And here's his new ploy.  He's saying, look, hey, I won't run for a re-election, but I'm staying in until then. 
[00:24:00]  Until September.  I'm staying in until September and...  I'm going to start cracking some skulls because I'm a little pissed off.  I'm getting pissed off.  And there's some protesters now hitting the streets that are for Mubarak.  That they're saying, all right, I think there's shenanigans here.  I think he's putting them out there.  Well, rumor has it that some of the looting were done by undercover Mubarak guys.  Yeah, his peeps to make the protesters look bad.  There's all sorts of rumors.  I don't know. 
[00:24:30]  Who knows what the fuck?  Who knows?  Did you see what Twitter did, though?  They have that voice.  Yeah, the Google thing.  Yeah, yeah.  What?  Pretty, pretty cool.  People that can't get their shit out over the Internet because there's so many problems  with the Internet, you can just call, leave a voicemail at a certain number, and the voicemail  will then go on to a site that's dedicated to Egypt.  So you can just listen to the people going, and there were lots of people in the street  and blah, blah, blah, blah.  Are they selecting which ones to do, though, or you got the dumb tweets you have to deal 
[00:25:00]  with?  One Egyptian guy going, blah, blah, boy.  Yeah, I just heard, like, angry, angry Egyptian people on the thing.  That's what you got.  Like, you hit the little thing, and it's like, you know, he must go.  He is killing his people.  Why am I Indian?  But the protesters are starting to get a little tired.  I mean, you know, they got to get back to kind of whatever they do, working, living, 
[00:25:30]  whatever.  This is Tarbash, the Egyptian magician.  I need freedom.  Need freedom.  I eat hot coal.  I disappear in the cloud.  Tarbash.  Oh, fuck.  Jerky boys, anyone?  Of course. 
[00:26:00]  I, everything.  One jerky boy doing very well.  Yeah, especially now that he's hooked up with Seth MacFarlane.  Oh, yeah, his voice.  Yeah, he's been on that show for a while, though.  Saul Rosenberg is pretty much his own animated character.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's changed the name.  So many years later, too.  Remember when they made that movie?  Jesus Christ.  I don't think I ever saw that, but.  That was when the Elmhurst tanks were still off the expressway.  That's like a long time ago.  Hey, so are they going to drag him out now? 
[00:26:30]  The army's got to be getting a little impatient.  Well, no one's quite sure where the army stands on this.  They know that the army's not going to fire on the people.  They've vowed that they will not fire on the people.  Yeah.  But they haven't said anything like they're with the people and are going to turn around and turn their guns on Mubarak.  So this is still playing out.  It's still playing out.  Let's see.  I think he's waiting it out and trying to wait out the people's passion for this and hope it goes away. 
[00:27:00]  I don't know.  They're talking about having another huge march on Friday.  So, I don't know.  It's his strategy is to just not say much, still be in charge, and wait for this thing to blow over.  Good luck, though.  I think one of the biggest problems, there's not a guy to step up.  There's a lot of sort of guys.  Yeah.  And, of course, the Muslim Brotherhood.  Yeah, the Muslim Brotherhood.  Who we're rooting for.  I'm with the Muslim Brotherhood here.  Muslim Brotherhood.  I want them in there because they will make that region exciting. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, boy, will they.  Very exciting.  Every oil tanker that tries to go through the Suez will be fired upon.  It'll just be an amazing life that we lead.  I think if there was a strong guy kind of rallying the troops, then this would be a lot easier.  Even this opposition leader that has come forward, I can't remember his name, but he doesn't have that oomph that the people want.  No.  To put him over the top.  Just ain't working. 
[00:28:00]  So, we wait and see what happens.  Because Jordan, in the meantime, is starting to oust some of their political leaders.  They're like, oh, well.  Let's do this before they start protesting.  Yeah, he's kind of smart on their part.  Yeah.  I love how Obama is telling Mubarak he has to step down.  I love how we're telling the guy, look, you have to step down.  Hey, Obama, why don't you.  Let the people fucking do their thing.  Take care of your own backyard.  And then we'll try to figure out the mess afterwards.  Take care of your own backyard now that your health care bill has been deemed unconstitutional. 
[00:28:30]  Are other countries weighing in?  Like, I don't mind us weighing in and just giving an opinion, but that's as much as we should do.  Again, we're giving more than an opinion.  We sent a guy to say, basically, you've got to fucking get out of here.  You've got to go.  We sent the main, what do they call them?  Envoy.  Envoy.  We sent one of those envoy guys.  I want to be an envoy.  That sounds like a fun job.  I bet you travel a lot when you're an envoy. 
[00:29:00]  You can't envoy from home.  No.  And he met Mubarak and said, you've got to go.  We're telling you you have to go.  Yeah.  Not the people.  We're telling you.  The United States is saying, look, you really have to go now.  He probably went, who told you?  You're just an envoy.  Envoy.  So.  Yeah.  So, is the thing still going on?  The news not all over it, which might, which I'm sure Mubarak likes the fact that the news  isn't pounding on it every second now.  Yeah, I'm losing a little interest.  And if the people lose interest, what was the big story before Egypt? 
[00:29:30]  What was the big, big story right before Egypt thing broke?  I don't even know anymore.  Because it was a big story.  Oh, Ted Williams?  No, no.  It was in between Ted Williams and Egypt.  Uh, Charlie Sheen?  Sure.  Uh, Charlie Sheen, that was, that was a pretty good one.  That would have had more life, I think.  Charlie Sheen's going to do rehab at home, which is very good news.  If you remember, every second of the day, the news was telling you, um, about, uh, Tucson, 
[00:30:00]  the shooting.  Oh, right.  Of course.  Uh, how, how she's doing.  It was like this whole.  I thought that was important to us.  Very important.  It shows you what the news is about.  Right up until, uh, Egypt.  Right up until the next big story.  The most important thing, please, if we could, uh, get a live sound from Punxsutawney, uh,  Pennsylvania.  They're dancing.  It's live.  It's, uh, happy Groundhog Day.  This is on, um, CNBC.  CNBC. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, they just went off of it.  All right, well.  Don't we have live footage from there?  Yeah, I hope we do.  God, I hate Punxsutawney Phil.  I love every year how much Jimmy hates Punxsutawney Phil.  I hate these people.  How great would a fuck would Napalm be?  He saw his shadow for a split second and then was incinerated.  I will say that normally I don't want to hear Alahu Akbar, but one Punxsutawney Phil.  I want Punxsutawney Phil to see his shadow like... 
[00:31:00]  I want his little, his little shadow to be burnt in that stump he comes out of.  Do they have a Groundhog in Egypt?  In Cairo?  Yeah.  It's going to be six more weeks of protesting.  If, uh, Punxsutawney Phil is beheaded, we will have six more weeks of chaos.  Right.  Thanks for pumping up my dumb joke.  I appreciate it.  It was lacking something.  Punxsutawney Phil just stinks. 
[00:31:30]  Enough.  What gear is this?  But at least he's the main one.  What's more embarrassing is everyone else trying to do their own Groundhog.  Staten Island has what?  Staten Island...  Where's our list of Groundhogs?  Is it Chuck?  Oh my God, for a second I thought...  Yeah.  That's too much shadow.  No, that's actually just a guy that was murdered in Staten Island.  Chuck the Groundhog.  That was his nickname.  Chuck the Groundhog got whacked out.  Uh, and they're saying, uh, uh, because of the weather, it's, it would be very odd if  the Groundhog did see his shadow and was scared and we had six more weeks of winter, so the 
[00:32:00]  forecast is looking for Punxsutawney Phil to, uh, not see his shadow.  Thus, we will have an early spring, uh, Opie, an early spring.  It's all about being scared?  Isn't the Groundhog scared because of all those drunk shitheads staring at it?  Fucking Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania assholes.  There they are, up top on Morning Joe.  Those shitheads.  I hate the fact that nothing goes on.  They, they desperately hold on to this ritual because without it, their town is nothing.  Ah. 
[00:32:30]  Even with it, their town is nothing.  And they're in Gobbler's Knob, which, uh, is a different, uh, it's different for Jim.  Jim thought it was another place.  Thought it was the bathroom.  Why me?  Gobbler's Knob.  Because you've been known to kneel in front of glory holes in some cocks.  I know, I'm kidding.  That character plays on the radio.  Exactly.  We all know that.  Exactly.  Who sucked my cock when I put it through that hole?  I was trying to look.  I thought it was a periscope.  I was trying to see sure.  Didn't you notice that I went, hi, matey.  Why would, hi, matey and a periscope? 
[00:33:00]  Yes.  But pirates said, are matey, and they didn't have periscope.  Well, I don't know much about, I don't know much about seamanship, do I?  Oh, come, puns rule.  They certainly do.  Oh, there's...  Okay, thank you, Danny.  There's not Ballsack Billy in Alberta, Canada.  Ballsack?  Ballsack.  It's Ballsack, but it's Ballsack.  It's Ballsack.  In Alberta.  Buckeye Chuck is in Ohio. 
[00:33:30]  General Beauregard Lee in Georgia, of course, General Lee.  If he sees his shadow and gets spooked, they'll have six more weeks of freaknik.  I think they ran freaknik out of that area.  Did they?  I think we got to update that shit.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I know we were down there once for it.  Yeah, freaknik!  Freaknik!  That was great.  Why is everyone running away?  They actually told us that they're leaving town for a week.  Yeah.  Never forget that.  We were flying in, and everybody was like...  The airport was packed. 
[00:34:00]  I'm like, what's going on?  Everyone was fleeing.  They were fleeing Atlanta.  They're like, oh, every year we take our vacation around freaknik and get the hell out of here.  And they were looking at us coming in like we were crazy.  And then we're driving down one of those 12-lane highways that the Atlanta area has.  Yeah.  And I saw nothing but, like, businesses boarded up.  I'm like, wow, did a fucking hurricane hit this area?  Oh, no, it's freaknik.  We got to prepare for freaknik.  Yeah.  Someone's got to update that.  Is that still happening down in the Atlanta area? 
[00:34:30]  I think they moved freaknik somewhere else.  Yeah.  Not sure where.  Let's see.  All right.  Well, well.  Wow.  Last year, they canceled it?  Oh, really?  Oh, boy.  Remember we were stuck in traffic because someone decided they had to stop their car and then  one of these booty chicks got on the roof of the car?  And started doing that.  Doing that booty dance?  She squatted down.  She put her hands on her thighs and just put her head over her shoulder.  She's looking over her shoulder and just started, like, wiggling her ass in a circle waiting 
[00:35:00]  for a male to come up behind her and just start fucking pumping on her ass.  What the fuck is that about?  It was on a highway, though.  It was on a highway.  I swear to God.  I swear to God.  I swear to God.  I thought one of them were going to rip off our rearview mirror.  I swear it was on a highway.  It happened to me once.  It wasn't on a side street.  We're like, why is there delays?  Oh, it was crazy.  And then it happened in front of us because I guess it was a chain reaction.  It was happening way down the road.  And then, oh, if you're going to do it, we're going to do it. 
[00:35:30]  No, that's not the clip, Danny.  That's not the clip.  Are you sure?  Oh, my God.  I'm not even going to say what that is.  Fired, so fired.  So fired.  I hear you could get in there with a Coke cam, though.  We got a freak Nick update.  That's what happened, right?  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  You knew to go to that video.  That's pretty amazing.  Danny knew how to find one of those videos.  Evan in Atlanta.  Evan.  Morning, boys.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  My Islanders, they're not really my Islanders, but they beat your Thrashers last night. 
[00:36:00]  I thought they lost in a shootout.  We don't really pay any attention to the Thrashers, but I'll tell you what.  Good for you, man.  It's better that way.  What happened to Freak Nick?  One of our former corrupt mayors, Bill Campbell, the way that he defeated Freak Nick, he just,  and this is the truth, he closed off every exit on the interstate that runs through downtown Atlanta  and just left the perimeter open so all those idiots could do was drive around in a big circle.  Wow.  That's pretty smart.  Who yelled racism? 
[00:36:30]  Well, some of the local characters down here, you know, the professional poverty pimps, you  know, the Sharpton wannabes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But the bear was black.  The guy who did it, he was a black guy.  But he knew it was bad for business.  It was bad for us.  Oh, it would take the entire city and just put it, I mean, it was done.  It would shut it down.  Yeah, yeah.  We saw you.  You couldn't do anything.  We absolutely saw it.  We had to fly in because we had an interview with a radio station.  It was the same exact time. 
[00:37:00]  It was unbelievable.  Yeah.  Yeah, but they shut it down.  And the way they did it was just hilarious.  All these people drove into town and they tried to get off the interstate.  And there was a cop at every single exit.  Keep moving.  And they're like, let me see your license.  If you don't live here, back on the interstate.  Oh, I would be ghost riding the whip.  Yeah.  Now they go down to the beach.  They go down to Savannah.  They have what they call Black College Spring Break.  Black College Spring Break.  Yeah. 
[00:37:30]  They have a downtown.  That's where Freaknik is.  Yeah.  Or that's how it started.  How many are in college, though?  Oh, please.  That actually go to Freaknik because some of the people I saw, and, you know, I could be  wrong because who am I?  I can't base just on looks, but I saw some people that didn't look like they were in  college.  They look a little too old, first of all, to be in college.  Yeah, unless they were going to DeVry.  They're in the DeVry Institute.  Well, then I think they turn into, like, a reunion.  So if you were ever in college.  Oh, okay.  And then you got some guys going, you know what, I'm just going to sneak in and make 
[00:38:00]  believe I'm in college.  Yeah.  Or we're in college.  All right.  Punch it out.  Thanks, fellas.  I'm also hearing that they moved it to Miami.  Maybe.  Or I know New Orleans has it, Savannah has it, and somewhere down in Florida.  Wow.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  That's a surprise, though, when you fly into those cities and don't know what's going on.  You go like, oh, wow.  That was unbelievable.  Let me see if this guy could add to that.  John in Pennsylvania, could you add to that?  Hi, John.  Yeah. 
[00:38:30]  What's going on, buddy?  Hey, man.  1996.  1996 is when they canceled Freaknik.  Wow.  Is that long ago?  96?  No way.  No, because we flew down.  That was last year.  The last year of Freaknik was 96.  Dude, we were there.  Yeah, we flew down around 97, 98, somewhere around there.  Right after we got the boot in Boston, we flew down there, and it was going on full force.  It was absolutely going on.  Yep.  And I know they moved it to Texas.  They had one in Galveston, Texas, somewhere around South Carolina, Florida, and somewhere 
[00:39:00]  else.  All right.  All right, sir.  Thank you for the erroneous information.  Yeah, let's go to Melvin, who wants to talk about Groundhog Day.  Is it Groundhogs or Groundhog?  Well, that's good.  Well, I would think Groundhogs now, because there's so many Groundhogs out there.  It's not just Punxsutawney.  What's up, Melvin?  Good morning.  Hey.  Morning.  Hey, I'd like to add about this Gay Groundhog Day thing.  And you know what?  Quarryville, Pennsylvania is where the home of Johnny Weir. 
[00:39:30]  Well, they have an Octavor Orphe down there, and it seems like they have their own Groundhog  Club, where they actually initiate a new member every year.  And what they do is, I guess they throw some guy in the water, and he gets all wet.  Did you phase out?  I did.  I just creeped out.  Oh, okay.  Oh, did he go?  He got it.  No, he's still there.  Oh, okay.  I thought you got all weirded out. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, what's up?  No, I was just talking about Groundhog Day in Quarryville.  In Quarryville.  So they have a Groundhog in Quarryville.  So everyone has to have a Groundhog now?  Yeah, really.  Yeah, it's called Octavor Orphe.  Yeah.  And what they do, they have their own little Groundhog festivities, and they initiate a new  member every year, and they throw them in Octavor or Creek, and I guess you'll be like  a lifelong member.  That's two.  Yeah.  Melvin, what do you got for the show? 
[00:40:30]  Groundhog Day?  Well, yeah, that was it, yeah.  What was it?  Just, you know, filling in on the Groundhogs and stuff, what they do.  No, but what happens around where you are?  Yeah, because it seems like there's a lot of Groundhogs.  Yeah, there is a lot.  I think Pucks of 20 Phil's down here, and there's like maybe four others.  Is there a ritual that goes on near you that's different than the main Groundhog?  No, not really, no.  No, but one of the guys I work with, he's in that stuff, and I just... 
[00:41:00]  And what does he do?  He seems stupid and gay to me.  Like, what kind of ritualistic thing does he do?  Oh, well, I guess he just go down and...  Do you have a Groundhog in your area?  That's the only reason we took your call.  Yes.  Oh, well, I got nothing else in, fellas.  Okay.  I'm just, you know, calling in the show.  First time caller.  No, you're doing a good job, but do you have a local Groundhog?  No, not really.  I mean, in the Lancaster's area, there's like about six of them. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, yeah, huh?  And the ones like Pucks of 20 Phil, Dr. Rare Orphe.  Right.  What's that one?  Pucks of 20 Phil.  Oh, we know that one.  Orphe.  Orphe.  Orphe.  Hmm.  That's three.  That's all I got, man.  What is Orphe?  Pucks of 20 Phil's a Groundhog.  Yeah.  What is Orphe?  It's another Groundhog.  There's a whole bunch of them.  It's just called Orphe the Groundhog.  Yeah.  He's where? 
[00:42:00]  In Quarryville, the home of Johnny Weir.  Johnny Weir lives there?  Well, he used to live in Quarryville.  And they're big on the Groundhog thing.  What about his brother, Brett Weir?  The super across the way.  And don't make me come over there for you, too, tough guy.  Can we play old school jerky voice today?  God, did I love that.  We're going to play one to break?  All right, good.  All right, Melvin.  Thank you so much.  Yes.  A great first time call.  Absolutely.  We look forward to more calls from you. 
[00:42:30]  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  I'll call again.  Yeah, I just have the opportunity to call you up there.  Okay.  I love this.  Melvin, what do you do for a living?  I'm in construction.  I've been recently laid off.  You know how important that is?  I build things.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what I do.  Why the layoff?  Lack of work?  I'm partially probably because of the weather.  Are you a union guy?  Yeah.  What did you build?  Sun tents?  No.  What is a sun tent?  Yeah, I'm doing the drywall up there. 
[00:43:00]  No, I don't do that stuff.  I do a little bit of everything.  A little of everything.  All right.  Yeah, huh?  Okay.  Sun tents don't exist.  What?  I play the program at work.  The program?  And there's two foremen that don't like this program.  Oh, boy.  They're too dirty.  And I've gotten in trouble several times.  Oh, now don't get yourself in trouble.  Exactly.  And tell those two queer foremen to keep buggering each other in the fucking trailer while you  work hard. 
[00:43:30]  Because that's what those two faggots are doing right now.  One of them has his helmet down, and he's buggering the other one.  He's deep-dicking the other foreman.  Yeah, that would be funny.  Yeah, that would be funny.  Well, yeah, that's why Jimmy's going with it.  All right, Melvin.  Now we're on your side.  Fuck your bosses.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Go construct something.  Yeah, go fucking build something.  I am building something.  Yeah, I'm doing my own home right now.  Oh, well, you don't get paid for that.  Well, I know that, but it's, you know. 
[00:44:00]  Sweat equity, as they call it.  A little sweat equity.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Oh, oh, oh.  Ah, ah, ah.  All right, yeah.  All right.  We got to go to the Groundhog Day.  Where is that?  Even though everyone knows it's going to be less winter or something.  Hmm.  Well, every year it's been fucking more winter, but it's so cloudy.  It's so stormy out that I'm thinking, oh, prognosticator.  And I'll tell you, if you're selling top hats, you made a bundle today.  No kidding.  And listen to that music. 
[00:44:30]  No kidding.  Sonny and Cher.  What does that have to do with?  Oh, come on.  Remember the movie Groundhog Day?  Wow, really?  No, we don't.  The time that the alarm radio went off in Bill Murray's hotel room, it was playing that song.  Oh, my God.  Right.  In fact, the guy behind him looks a little like Bill Murray.  Why would we listen to them and not the guy?  Fuck it.  Which is?  Are we sober?  Yeah, we know the answer already.  That's rhetorical.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  All right.  So we'll check in with them in about 30 minutes.  In the meantime, we have 30 minutes.  They'll be doing their thing. 
[00:45:00]  I can't wait.  And more info from the future people.  Yes.  I didn't know that song was in the movie Groundhog Day.  I had no idea.  No, I didn't either.  So thank you, future people.  Thank God for those people.  Nothing but future people on the news today.  Future people.  Future people.  Let's break.  Yeah.  Do you know, by the way, just Jane Fonda?  Yeah.  My father's a military guy, so he's always...  He explained to me why.  Hated her.  He hates, right?  Yeah, he would have won her movies in the house, and I didn't... 
[00:45:30]  He explained to me why.  Fuck her.  Commie.  You know who hates Jane Fonda is my mom.  She fucking despises Jane Fonda.  I wonder if Sam's mom hates Jane Fonda.  For the same fucking reason.  Well, it's amazing.  I was just reading her on Snopes, like, what she did.  Everything they said she did was pretty much true, except she did not.  Like, there was rumors that POWs had slipped her paper, and she had turned it over.  That never happened.  But the other stuff did happen.  The, you know, sitting on the aircraft...  She sat on an anti-aircraft battery and...  Said that she called them liars when they came back.  Yeah. 
[00:46:00]  I hate this fucking cunt so much.  I know.  And it's amazing to me how Michael career...  Michael Richards, he didn't have much of a career after Seinfeld, but he's ruined because  he said nigger on stage.  Yeah.  Mel Gibson was recorded saying nigger, and he said wet-backed, and his fucking career  is in deep trouble.  This fucking pig...  Yeah.  ...fucking said our soldiers were lying, and she had a great movie career after.  I fucking hate this woman.  Yeah, she's like...  Wow, do I hate Jane Fonda.  Tokyo Rose.  Yeah.  But even...  She wasn't as bad, because they said she did it under duress. 
[00:46:30]  That's what she said, at least.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  She just went there.  She's like, oh, let me hang out with the enemy and, you know, sit on anti-aircraft guns that  have killed airmen.  Yeah, what a bitch.  Fuck her.  But it's amazing.  She should have been scorned from fucking celebrity.  Who?  Jane Fonda?  Yeah, she should have been just thrown out of Hollywood.  Roman Polanski stuck his dick in a 13-year-old's ass, drugged.  He was forgiven.  He fucking went on to make films.  But you know what I mean?  It's amazing who they forgive.  Yeah.  I think Woody Allen's a genius, but Woody Allen was forgiven for what he did. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  But man, you say something racially inappropriate, and fucking...  You are cooked.  You're done.  You are fucking cooked.  Unbelievable, yeah.  Not fair.  She's still just able to skip through life.  People love her.  I can't believe how angry I am reading about this woman again.  Veterans, oh my God.  Good.  They fucking hate her.  They should.  And wherever she goes, they let it be known that they do not like her.  I love when they disrupt her movies.  That's why she apologized.  They were disrupting her movie.  Yeah, of course. 
[00:47:30]  She's not apologizing for anything.  She's a fucking king.  Her father was embarrassed by that, too.  Henry Fonda.  Oh, I bet.  Mortified.  Yeah.  Dumb fucking daughter.  Go make more naked movies, you slut.  I hate her.  Very good.  Hey, before we go to break, I was kind of just wondering if...  Yemen's president is stepping down.  Really?  Yemen president's stepping down.  It says interest of country outweighs his own.  Holy shit.  Because they're protesting in Yemen.  He doesn't want to deal with this shit.  Who's going to step in there? 
[00:48:00]  Muslim Brotherhood?  Muslim Brotherhood.  Muslim Brotherhood.  Let's get the shirts made.  Wow, that's big news, huh?  Whole Middle East is changing.  Yemen government shakeup.  The president says he will not seek re-election.  He's stepping down.  Wow.  He doesn't want to deal.  He wants to live.  He's like, yeah, I don't care.  I'll fucking relax.  Hey, I was wondering about Groundhogs, and I was thinking if, like, you know, where we're  from.  Long Island had one.  Did it?  Does it?  Oh, yeah, it does.  Where? 
[00:48:30]  That's the only reason why I'm mentioning it.  At a bald hill?  It's a ghetto one.  Is it in Wyandange?  Brentwood?  It's Malvern.  Malvern.  Malvern was a little rough.  Malvern Malik?  There you go.  It's Malvern Malik.  It's the groundhog out there at Long Island.  You know what?  Exactly.  I'm not even going to say the name now.  All right.  We'll continue.  Stay there.  Hi, Rick. 
[00:49:00]  Yes, hello.  Hello?  I called you before.  My name is the Egyptian magician.  The Egyptian magician?  Right.  I called.  They told me to call back in one, ten minutes.  Uh, hold on.  Hi, can I help you?  Hi, this is Carol, the night manager.  Yes, my name is Tarbash, the Egyptian magician.  I do magic act.  Okay.  Do you want to come in and audition?  What I do, I eat hot coal. 
[00:49:30]  That's great.  I stab customer and I...  Huh?  I sick my cat on my performers and they maul them on stage.  Wow.  But in my country, that's considered the...  Considered, yeah, that's considered magic.  Right.  Right.  And then I light people on fire, but it is, you know, fake, you know?  And I...  It's fake.  Right.  But that's what I do.  The Egyptian magician. 
[00:50:00]  The Egyptian magician.  Right.  Then for encore, I punch my chest and then it disappears to the crowd.  You punch your chest and it disappears in the crowd.  That's it?  Yes, my friend.  Uh-huh.  Um, well, if you want to stop by, you would only be able to do two tricks.  Okay.  That's good enough for me.  I'm the best.  Okay.  Every Wednesday night.  Then I have small, uh, mountain cat. 
[00:50:30]  The mountain cat.  That I terrorize people.  That I terrorize people.  You terrorize people with a mountain cat.  Okay.  Well, I don't know if you...  You better not bring the mountain cat in for the first time.  Okay.  Okay.  Um, come by, quarter to nine, sign up, and see how you do.  Okay.  And then, maybe just for extra bonus, I choke some of you faculty staff.  Yeah, you choke the staff.  Yeah.  Okay.  Whatever. 
[00:51:00]  Okay.  Then I come out with whip.  Yeah, you come out with the whip.  Okay.  We'll stop by.  We'll see how the act goes.  Okay, my friend.  Thank you, my friend.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony.  On the virus.  The Sirius XM.  We're looking at Christy Brinkley, because, uh, she's on the birthday list today.  Uh-oh.  57 years old.  Unbelievable.  Holy shit.  And then we were looking at pictures to see what she kind of looks like, and, uh, not bad 
[00:51:30]  at all.  And then we saw a picture with her wearing a hat.  And when they start wearing hats, you know it's over.  Yeah?  Because the hats are a distraction.  Is that what it is?  For the older women, yeah.  The older women, uh.  When they start wearing those fancy hats.  Pop on the fedora.  Not the winter hat.  Just, yeah, kind of the fedora type.  Right, exactly.  A derby.  Starting to cover up the hurt.  The derby should make a comeback.  Probably will.  Everything else does.  I'm going to wear a derby.  You want to be a derby guy.  A derby.  A bowler hat.  Hey, uh, stupid Ryan Seacrest, uh, tweeted yesterday that you got to watch American Idol, 
[00:52:00]  because they're going to be, uh, apologizing.  I think.  Waddle Doodle?  Uh, Sam's all about the pop culture.  I don't know if it's happening tonight or tomorrow, but, uh, make sure you watch, like,  in the beginning, because they're going to apologize for something.  And I think they're going to apologize.  Yeah.  Oh, are they ready to go?  I'm not sure.  No, no.  Oh, yeah, soon.  Uh, and the rumor is they're going to apologize for, uh, wheeling out that vegetable.  What?  Yeah, because it was.  How do you apologize for that? 
[00:52:30]  Basically, they, they got a lot of hate mail from people going, what, what, what did that  have to do with the show?  And just like we said, why are they teasing an apology?  Well, cause Ryan, that's what Ryan Seacrest does.  He creates buzz.  That's why he's got so many followers on Twitter.  How?  I think apologizing for it is a little sicker than even bringing her out.  Yeah.  He's teasing that there's some kind of apology and a lot of people speculating that it's  got to be when they rolled her out.  You can make an excuse.  You can justify it easier than you can apologize for it. 
[00:53:00]  I think you can say, Hey, this guy, this girl, this happened.  It's part of his life story.  We do people's stories.  What's your problem?  Well, are you uncomfortable with seeing people?  You can really, you know, lay into people that are upset with it, but to apologize for  it is almost like, Hey, we're sorry.  You had to look at this, you know, fucking creature.  Yeah.  So the girl had an accident and we would be empathetic and we, uh, why not, um, put her in the limelight  for a minute?  Although it's a network, so obviously they'll do the wrong thing.  But the other thing is they're thinking that it might, uh, it might be that they left Taylor 
[00:53:30]  Hicks out of some kind of like all-star American idol montage.  Oh, okay.  That's probably it then where they forgot about poor Taylor Hicks.  Taylor Hicks sucked with his dumb fucking white hair.  I forgot you weren't a fan.  I hated him.  I met him here at a Sirius XM.  He couldn't have been nicer.  He's such a fucking nice guy.  Uh, well, that's all he's got is being a nice guy.  I like, I like, I like, I'll drop him.  Oh yeah.  He's had a tough time since I don't, but, uh, Oh yeah. 
[00:54:00]  But I liked him and I liked him at the time because I thought he was very different and  he was, he had a hell of a voice on him.  Oh, just Peter Graves hair.  Shut up.  You're, yeah, you're 27.  Die that.  No one's going to know.  Yeah.  Come on.  There's a little medicine on it.  Medicine.  I think I'm Bobby Cole.  A little medicine.  Ask Liam Neeson what he's been using.  Go to a fucking Japanese restaurant and just, just make sure you don't get wasabi in your  hair.  Tip your head in.  It is Groundhog's Day, despite the fact that there is a gigantic storm in the Northeast. 
[00:54:30]  And as you can see, live in Puxatawny, Pennsylvania, they have just pulled Phil out of  his hutch.  The big question now is whether or not he saw his shadow when he was pulled out.  You can see they've got TV cameras and whatnot.  But what happens next is once they parade him in front of the crowd of thousands there,  within the next 10 minutes or so, one of the officials there in Puxatawny, Pennsylvania,  will make a declaration whether or not he saw his shadow. 
[00:55:00]  So stand by for that.  In the meantime, back to the studio.  Prognosticator of prognosticators.  Prognosticators.  Yeah, exactly.  I fucking hate it.  Has determined that on this day, fuck, shut up.  And to the people out there that say, why does the rest of the world hate us?  This is why.  Look at that.  This is why.  They're spending a lot of time on the news over this dumb groundhog.  And they're having a revolution in Egypt. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, there's a revolution in Egypt and there's dummies with fucking top hats and a fucking  giant rat trying to figure out what the weather's going to be.  Right.  Based on if he sees his shadow and talks to the guy.  The rat talks to the guy.  Oh, of course.  He's got a stealer's fucking.  But you know what?  It's all these idiots that show up there.  Yeah.  If no one's showing up or covering it.  But those people don't give a fuck.  It's a party.  They're all just trying to get laid.  Oh, here he goes.  Oh.  Constructed which scroll to read. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, which scroll.  It sure is cold today.  Shut up.  How cold is it?  Here ye, here ye, here ye.  On Gobbler's Knob, on this beautiful Groundhog Day, February 2nd, 2011, Punxsutawney Phil was  raised from his borough by the call of President Bill Dealey.  He greeted his handlers, Ben Hughes, and John Griffiths, and after casting an inquisitive  eye towards thousands of his faithful followers, he proclaimed, the Steelers are going to the 
[00:56:30]  Super Bowl.  Going to the Super Bowl.  Wouldn't you say win the Super Bowl?  Win it, yeah.  Dummy?  You hack?  We know they are.  Oh.  Back to the business at hand.  He surveyed his surroundings carefully.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And found that there was no shadow around.  So, on early spring, it went in.  Yeah, motherfucker. 
[00:57:00]  Fucking A, motherfucker.  Now, let's kill the groundhog.  Just fucking spike them like you would have a football.  The sky is clear.  Prepare yourself for warmth.  Well, that is huge news, everybody.  We love Phil.  We love Phil, everybody.  No, he tried, though.  He tried.  By the way, someone is being squished by a tank as we speak.  Exactly. 
[00:57:30]  Exactly.  Oh, God.  That's that guy's whole job.  Now he has 364 days to wait to do that again.  That's all he does.  Why are they interviewing the gopher?  All right.  We're watching to see what the determination is from the groundhog.  What?  They always said it, asshole.  We do not expect him to actually speak into that microphone.  But this is a tradition for many, many years.  But thank you very much for coming.  All right.  Phil's 125th birthday. 
[00:58:00]  And what happened?  Well, he did not see his shadow, which means it is actually an early spring, which on the  day of a gigantic blizzard is exactly what we want to hear.  I wish it would just lay its big fucking teeth into that guy's neck.  At least they've ever done that at Puxatawney.  Really?  Very well.  All right.  Straight ahead on this Groundhog Day.  What a shitty show.  They punched, kicked, and then left him hanging from a fence.  What a shitty show.  That is pretty much the big moment. 
[00:58:30]  That's the money shot of Groundhog Day.  And they suck.  Oh, I know.  Look, as people that find some stuff funny that we, what am I trying to say?  I just, putting the kid in the tree makes me laugh really hard.  And I know we're not supposed to laugh at that.  I know.  It's so twisted, obviously.  But the video of him in the tree.  I know.  Because he's being beat up.  It's horrible.  There's a case of bullying that was going on. 
[00:59:00]  And obviously there's a bullying epidemic going on out there.  But the video of the kid.  I know.  They're just stuffing him in a tree.  Because that shit happened to all of us.  Yeah.  But it wasn't bullying back then.  No, it was called, you know, you should have ran faster.  And obviously.  Run faster home.  I got to be careful.  Obviously what these kids did is, it's horrible.  It's horrible.  And it's wrong.  But the video of the kid.  They're trying to shove him in.  Why are they trying to shove him in the tree?  They also try to shove him into something else, too.  Like on top of a fence. 
[00:59:30]  Trying to like hang him up on a fence.  And in the end, the kid wasn't really hurt.  No.  Still horrible.  You know.  Obviously.  The tape.  Oh, tape.  The fucking video I saw, they didn't, they weren't like kicking him.  It wasn't like they had him down on the ground and they were dragging him around by his feet  on the ground.  Right.  But he was down there and I thought they were going to start kicking him in the head and  shit.  And I didn't see any of that, so.  They lifted him up and tried to.  They fucked with him.  They fucked with him bad.  Put him in a tree. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  Why are they blurring everybody out, man?  These guys are.  Because they're utes.  Yeah.  But they were brave enough to do it and fucking film it for their friends.  So let's see your faces.  Upper Darby.  That's where the Tower Theater is.  Upper Darby is.  Yeah.  I know Upper Darby.  And look, now they're dragging him by his feet.  Yeah, but this part.  And then they pick him up and now they're trying to hang him on a fence.  This is actually news, though.  Some kids put another kid in a tree.  It's like.  Yeah.  Because look.  Look.  This guy's angry.  We will not have this happen.  It will never blur.  Make their fellow students and make the streets unsafe. 
[01:00:30]  It's unconscionable.  We're not going to tolerate it.  And they're going out in handcuffs.  Oh, shit.  Authorities say they have arrested seven teenagers in connection with the assault.  White and black.  Six were arrested.  Nice.  They got together.  They got together for some bullying.  Working together for bullying.  It's about time we get together for something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was nice to see.  Does the kid being stuffed in the tree make you laugh, even though you're not supposed  to laugh at that?  It's hysterical.  It is, right?  Yeah.  Because, you know, you've seen that before. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, my God.  I saw that.  As kids being bullied, you see that.  They shoved me in a locker in high school.  All sorts of shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Stop.  Turn that down.  It was part of growing up, wasn't it?  Yeah.  Being bullied.  Then again, part of growing up is when those kids show back up with a fucking trench coat.  Right.  And they fucking extract a pound of vengeance.  Sure.  But is it worse now than it was before teachers did anything and before the police did anything?  Yes.  And I'll tell you why, because Ellen DeGeneres is talking about it. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, shit.  Makes it way worse.  Oh, shit.  Bullying.  Because back then, no one went to the fucking principal.  When you got your ass handed to you outside the school or you were bullied or some shit,  like everyone knew who the bully was.  You just didn't fuck with him.  And you walked past on eggshells hoping nothing was going to happen where he decided you were  the one, you were the fucking wounded gazelle by the watering hole.  That was what the bully did.  Who the fuck went to the principal?  That's like going to the warden in prison. 
[01:02:00]  You didn't do that.  You just didn't do that.  You didn't do it.  That would make it way worse.  Now the police get involved in shit.  Although we never had the opportunity to put the fun stuff in front of the world to see.  True.  On YouTube and shit.  Yeah, I don't know.  We just had to tell the stories.  We were like old school, like the Indians telling the story of when you beat the kid up.  I don't know.  Patanka.  I don't have kids that age, so I have no idea if it's worse.  I have no idea. 
[01:02:30]  I would assume it might be a little more worse than when we were growing up.  Is the result worse is what I'm talking about.  Like the bullying.  All right.  Everyone had bullying events or bullied people or whatever it was.  But did we turn into a more violent people than these people that are being bullied now are turning into?  I don't know.  Like Jimmy was saying, he comes back with a trench coat mafia kind of a thing.  I really don't know.  Yeah.  This is out of our league because we don't have kids that age. 
[01:03:00]  Oh.  I know my sister, she's got a 12 and a 10, and she said it's a completely different world out there for kids.  Yeah, yeah.  Completely.  But that's her take on it.  They are being raised softer and weaker.  So much softer, and I think that plays into this.  Thank you.  It does, but a part of it, like a lot of the, I mean like real nasty bullying, there's a lot of fucking 40 and 50 year old fucking cocksuckers out there.  And there's a lot of people out there that are fucked up because they were bullied that are like fucking squeamish as adults. 
[01:03:30]  And it's like beyond just normal competition, but guys that were just tortured growing up.  I mean, it's a balance.  You don't care.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I wonder what the, you know, repercussions there are.  I don't know.  They are being raised like really fucking.  Wimpy.  Wimpy.  Like, kids don't go out anymore.  You don't see them like riding their bikes around fucking and just being out doing things.  That's a good point.  We were thrown out of the house as kids. 
[01:04:00]  It's like, get out, do something, go.  You got home from school, and you were in maybe for a quick snack, right?  And then you were gone for hours.  And then you were gone until at least dark.  And your mother never knew where you were.  Your father, they didn't know where you went.  They just know you went out with friends.  I'm going out with my friends.  All right, whatever.  I remember when you did stay home, maybe because it was still in the middle of a snowstorm or rain or whatever.  Yeah.  And it just felt weird.  It was weird.  It was odd.  That you were inside?  Yeah, inside.  And then we'd go traipsing around in the woods.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:04:30]  It turns into like Lord of the Flies.  You're just fucking throwing rocks, building forts and throwing things, breaking shit.  Man, you're right.  You don't really see kids out anymore.  Kids aren't out.  They're not out playing anymore.  As much.  Yeah.  We had neighborhoods where I grew up where it was like every weekend you couldn't even like drive around.  The adults couldn't drive around because the streets were just kids with bicycles and fucking, you know, we'd play war and shit.  We'd get little guns and you'd run around the yards and playing and shit. 
[01:05:00]  No one does that anymore.  They lock their kids up in the house to keep them fucking safe because there's animals out there, I guess.  I don't know.  Well, the perception.  I think the news has scared the shit out of parents, too.  Because, I mean, there are horrid people out there doing horrid things.  But, again, is it any more than it was?  Nah, you're always going to lose a few to some kid touching.  Of course.  Just a few.  Happen then.  What are you going to do?  You've got to deal with the overall numbers.  Yeah, yeah.  Because you've got to look at the percentages.  You can't save everybody. 
[01:05:30]  Percentages.  You've got to sacrifice a few of the little fuckers.  I don't know.  What do kids do these days?  Video games.  Just computing.  Are you kidding me?  Computers.  You don't go out.  And they all got phones.  Phones.  Go to the mall.  My 10-year-old needs to get a phone.  Could you imagine having a phone at 10?  At 10.  How cool that would be?  I couldn't use the phone at 10 in the house.  Like that phone.  I had to, like...  Ask permission.  Don't tie up the line because there wasn't call waiting.  Yeah, don't tie it up. 
[01:06:00]  And no long-distance calls.  Long-distance.  Who are you calling long-distance as a 10, 11-year-old?  Yeah.  Anyone still doing the prank call?  Or is it too easy to get caught?  Too easy to get caught.  Remember how much fun prank phone calls were?  That was drugs.  For me, that was doing drugs on the weekend.  If you had, like, friends over and you just grabbed that phone and had the balls enough to start dialing and making prank phone calls, 
[01:06:30]  you would laugh your ass off, and it was such a feeling of satisfaction, and it was just the greatest thing growing up.  Did you buy into the fact when the guy on the other end said, I know where you live, and you were freaked out the rest of the day?  Sometimes I was freaked out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, I don't know.  Maybe he just does.  I don't know.  There was no call waiting or anything, but he goes, I know where you live.  I don't know.  And the whole day, you're just in this paranoid state, like, does he?  Did he recognize my voice?  I think he might know.  Oh, fuck.  I remember pranking once, a bad call, and this was always the ballsiest thing you could ever do, is dialing zero and pranking the operator. 
[01:07:00]  Because you would prank the operator, and then you'd hang up and pick up your phone, and for, like, five minutes, you wouldn't have a dial tone.  Like, she'd pull the fucking plug on your phone.  Right, because they're trying to trace it.  And you'd start freaking out, like, they're tracing it, they're sending the cops, you'd look out the window thinking the cops are going to come for a prank call.  That takes balls.  It was scary.  I don't know if I ever did that.  It was usually a friend that was fucking up.  It's like, you don't prank the operator, you asshole. 
[01:07:30]  It was usually the friend that discovered pot first.  That's like whacking out a maiden man.  Look, can we just call the bowling alley?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We have to call the operator, really?  Bowling alley, ask him if you've got 10-pound balls.  Exactly.  And hang up.  It's fucking, we'll laugh our asses off.  It's a classic.  Eat a whole pack of Hubba Bubba.  It's fucking great.  I used to love, I used to call, when I was in high school, we'd get stoned, and I used  to call these, like, places where nuns were, where they were, where there was, like, this  sisterhood or whatever it was.  A nunnery? 
[01:08:00]  A convent?  Yeah, it was, like, a place that nuns.  Was it a convent?  I don't know.  The convent Santanco?  I just don't remember.  It was something that nuns ran or whatever, and I would always call and say that, like,  you know, my older men were having sex with me, and.  Oh, no, you didn't know?  Oh, yeah, constantly.  Holy shit, what are you talking?  Yeah, we would just giggle.  How come you have to turn?  We're always talking about this innocent little childhood thing that we would do.  So he always has to take it way further.  You know, do you have Prince Albert in a can?  You better let him out. 
[01:08:30]  Hardy har, hang up.  And you have to talk about calling nuns and telling them you had man dick in your ass.  Yeah, I was being sexually abused.  I called a bomb.  I told you a bomb's threat at my high school.  Holy shit.  We were all stoned.  And I remember they said everybody had to leave the school and walk out.  That was convincing.  Wow.  That's past 1985.  I think the statute of limitations doesn't run out until tomorrow.  Oh, yeah, let us.  Now you're injured.  I was stoned. 
[01:09:00]  What are you going to do?  I was fucking high.  We were all laughing.  My friend's house.  I know.  You can't do it now.  I've been really high.  I've never called in a bomb threat anywhere.  If you knew when I was even younger where I tried to call, I called the White House.  I was very young.  I was probably 12, 13.  I forget how I got them.  I had the operator put me through or something from the public library.  Was it Reagan?  It was in.  Oh, God.  You were 12?  You know what?  19.  It was probably Reagan, beginning of Reagan.  I remember it was 13. 
[01:09:30]  It was Ender Carter.  And I remember calling in.  What did you want to say?  Bomb scare, yeah.  To the White House?  Yeah.  What were you going to do?  Wow.  You got through.  I don't know.  I was just 12.  You wanted to see if you could do it.  Yeah.  I used to call the FBI all the time.  You don't think.  You were really on the edge.  I was antisocial.  Yeah.  You're really like.  I don't even know if it went through.  I might have just been the operator.  I don't even know if she actually got me through to the White House.  You were one of those kids like that.  If my mother.  Like my mother used to keep tabs on our friends a little bit. 
[01:10:00]  And you were one of those that she would say,  I really don't want you hanging out with that boy.  Yeah.  That Jimmy Norton boy.  I think you'd be that kid.  I never knew when the joke was over.  I remember.  I was thinking this this morning on the way in.  I was listening to this song by Kiss called Do You Love Me?  And at the end of the song, they just keep repeating.  Do you love me?  It just keeps repeating it.  But I remember me and my friend Lutzy.  We're listening.  Lutzy.  Yeah.  You don't see Lutzy's anymore. 
[01:10:30]  There's no Lutzy.  Can Lutzy come out and play?  I was at Lutzy's house and the Kiss record was playing.  And every time they would say, do you love me?  I would just scream no and jump up and pretend I was stepping on the record.  But it happened so many times that it just got uncomfortable and unfunny.  And his father came in and was like, could you be quiet?  There we go.  There it is.  Do it, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Stomp on that record.  No.  No. 
[01:11:00]  That's in Edison, though.  I was like in third grade or second grade.  Yeah.  No.  I remember this one.  No.  I was just like trying to be funny.  Ugh.  Do you have your songs today and remember where a skip was in the song?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's fucked up.  Yeah.  The song, I was Kiss Destroyer.  And on the way in, we're going to listen to the whole song.  Okay.  Yeah, right.  There's that song called Flaming Youth, which I don't know what that was about. 
[01:11:30]  Paul Stanley sang it.  But there's a song, Getting It Together to Break Out of My Cage is the line.  And my record would skip.  It would go brage.  Like it would ache out of my cage would be taken out.  And I hear that now.  And that's 30 years ago.  And I still fucking wait for that skip.  That's fucked up because I know exactly what you're talking about.  That's happened with a few songs where, yeah, you played them on a record.  So many times.  And it skipped in the same place.  Yeah.  And, yeah. 
[01:12:00]  And you hear the song now and you expect to hear the skip.  You ever put a nickel on it or a penny to try to fucking make it not skip?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  But then it just makes the rest of the song slow and not skipping?  Yeah.  Sometimes the needle would be so fucked up it would just go right across the whole record.  I was so bad.  I used to always not know what the lyrics, like I would always misinterpret lyrics and think  they were saying other things.  And you would sing along to it?  No.  Wrong lyrics?  Yeah.  I was wrong lyrics, kid. 
[01:12:30]  Wrong lyrics, kid.  No.  Yeah.  I was.  No.  But in the beginning of Do You Love Me?  The line is, you really like my limousine.  But I didn't know what that was at that age.  I thought he was saying, you really like Muzzy Muzzy.  What was that?  Isn't he the contender to take over in Egypt?  I didn't know what that was.  The contender.  The contender.  Fuck, dude. 
[01:13:00]  It's embarrassing.  That is embarrassing.  You didn't just, you really did do dopey things as a kid.  And you kind of like, they're so embarrassing sometimes when you think about it.  Once my cousins came up from like Maryland and we went in the backyard to play.  And we, I thought we could fish.  There wasn't a lake around or anything.  So I dug a hole with a little spade shovel and filled it up with water.  And put these twigs with thread and a safety pin on it in the water hole. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  And convinced everybody and myself that the fish are able to dig tunnels with their tails.  And we'll end up in this hole and we'll catch fish.  And then, and then we had to go somewhere and we came back and the whole time we were gone,  all I was thinking is I can't wait to get home and, and pull this fish out of this little  hole that was dug.  And I got home and of course the, the, the dirt soaked up the water in like two seconds 
[01:14:00]  and, and it was just a little mud hole with no fish.  It's a little pile of inoculated arms.  But I thought there would be fish.  I really was psyched.  But it sounds like the beginning of a child abuse movie.  You know what I mean?  It has that creepy, like it, there's a weird innocence slash imagination going on, but you  know, it's covering up some horrific fucking abuse at home.  It was just dopey kid thinking.  You're on your hands and knees digging the hole and trying to block out the fact that 
[01:14:30]  your hiney is on fire.  It feels like a flame is being put into it, but it's really just the, uh, the average  sized genitals of a much older man, but it feels like firing your backside fire in my,  in my bung hole.  And no, I just, I was a dopey kid who like actually convinced myself.  And it was all I would think about the entire time we had to go to the store and I was like,  Oh, I want to get home.  The fish.  And I think I started crying when there was no fish. 
[01:15:00]  And that could mean just horrific shit.  Of course I would cry at every time.  I used to steal movie lines and like try to make them my own.  Oh no.  Like what?  Like serious ones?  Oh yeah.  Oh no.  Yes.  Not like doing funny comedy.  You'd be like, no, you would try to make people think that you came up with this shit.  I would just like say them.  Like, I remember there's a scene.  Would you change it?  If I had to, but I remember there's a scene and guests was coming to dinner where Sidney 
[01:15:30]  Poitier yells at his father.  His father was like a postal worker.  My dad was too.  So I used the same speech on my dad.  No.  It was really bad.  I remember seeing that.  Yeah.  Did he know you were using it?  I don't know.  He had to.  He had to.  He was like, wait a minute.  My kid's doing movies.  There's one line in there that says, you think of yourself as a colored man.  I think of myself as a man.  I don't think I said that.  Yeah.  I wouldn't have thrown that in.  Probably not appropriate.  It's embarrassing.  Do you remember one line from it that you actually said to him about postal worker? 
[01:16:00]  It was something about, um, I don't care if you carry that bag 30 or 90,000 miles.  You did what you were supposed to do because you owed me like as the son.  It was a good speech.  It's a pretty good monologue.  Because it was written by a fucking, like an Academy Award winning writer.  It was pretty good by when Sidney Poitier said it.  Yeah.  When he delivered it.  That was Jimmy Norton.  Young fucking plagiaristic Jimmy Norton.  It wasn't bad.  It wasn't as good when I was standing there on my steps in North Brunswick, like in my 
[01:16:30]  house, yelling it up at them, trying to shoehorn it in.  Just trying to use it.  And they were just reading the paper, ignoring me.  Who cares?  That's hilarious, dude.  Additioning little faggot.  Oh, how fucking, ew.  Cringy, dumb kid stuff.  This guy had a prank that shut down his whole high school.  Bill in Brooklyn.  Bill.  Yeah, hi.  Good morning.  Oh, and hey.  How's everything?  Whoa, Reagan's stepping down?  Hello.  Why?  Oh, look at that.  Why is he stepping?  I don't know. 
[01:17:00]  Farewell address to the nation.  Oh, it was today.  President Reagan's stepping down today.  Breaking news on Fox News.  January 11th.  Oh, well, then what the hell is it?  Oh, is it his 100th birthday?  Yeah.  What?  Whatever.  What happened?  Reagan appointee hands.  Oh, it was a Reagan appointee that handed down the ruling that health care law is unconstitutional.  Did I ever tell you one of the first jokes I ever wrote, like when I first started doing comedy?  What?  That was about Reagan.  And I was like, yeah, Reagan was, uh, Reagan.  Oh, no, I didn't write it.  Actually, it was what I did before I did comedy.  I thought it'd be funny.  If I said, like, uh, yeah, Reagan, uh, was an actor. 
[01:17:30]  Now he's president.  He's still acting.  Hey, let's go to Bill in Brooklyn.  Bill, what do you got for the show?  Yeah, hi, good morning, go home and hey.  Who's the first lady, Jane Wyman?  Basically, about, uh, 20 years ago, we, uh, we, uh, uh, before school sessions began, we shoved a boombox in a, uh, air-conditioned vent in one of the classrooms.  And I plugged it in, uh, before, uh, classes so that it should be able to blast, uh, during classes. 
[01:18:00]  And we attached the contraption, you know, the clap-on, clap-off.  And, uh, as the, uh, sessions began, our class basically gave a loud clap.  And the music went throughout the whole ice school through the vents of the air-conditioned.  Principal comes running in, asking where the noise is coming from.  Our teacher points to the vents of the air-conditioned.  And he says, yeah, in my office, it's coming through there as well.  Took them a while to figure it out. 
[01:18:30]  And we just clapped on, clapped off.  Music went on, music went off.  Took a whole day until they figured out what happened.  Um, but, uh, the whole, uh, the whole high school had school for, had music for the day.  And, uh, it was, uh, they couldn't figure it out.  Anyway, punching out.  I'm sorry for that.  You know, um.  That's pretty cool.  When you already combined the clapper. 
[01:19:00]  I wonder what song it was.  Man.  Hopefully taps.  Remember what he did to this radio show.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right.  That's all right.  Fuck.  We were doing so well.  I know, just a little fun.  You didn't like my joke that I wrote?  No, no, that, uh, still acting.  Get it?  Man.  Oh, boy, were you fucking profound.  No, I just thought it was clever wordplay.  I'm clever.  He's still acting. 
[01:19:30]  That's a good joke.  Uh, no.  I don't like it.  I don't, I don't find it funny at all.  It wasn't.  It's not a home run.  It's fucking, it's horrible.  Do you know one of the first jokes I ever did on stage?  And this is the Varsity Pub in 1990.  It was stupid.  I said something about a black hole.  They found a black hole and it turns out it was just Oprah laying spread eagle.  No, you didn't say that.  It was a big Oprah pussy joke.  That was one of the first jokes I ever did say.  You didn't say that.  I did.  Did it get a laugh?  No, why would it? 
[01:20:00]  It was horrible.  Of course not.  Got exactly what it should have.  A zero.  An uncomfortable stares.  There was, I didn't know that there was inappropriate jokes.  Inappropriate jokes.  Oh, you didn't know?  No, it wasn't even, it was just because it wasn't a good joke.  It was just, you know, you get it.  She's a big pussy and she's black.  It's so, um, was it hacky back then?  No, it was, it was just terrible.  It was black hole jokes and then equating it with a colored woman's pussy.  Yeah.  And a fat colored woman.  Wasn't there an Oprah crack joke? 
[01:20:30]  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What was the Oprah crack joke?  Old school.  Smuggling how many something pounds of crack in her pants.  Yeah.  That was a terrible joke.  An old school joke, we all told.  Hey, uh, we're going to go to break.  It's Black History Month.  Yes, it is.  We're changing it up a little bit and doing black tweets.  Black tweets.  And maybe we'll throw in some old school black history stuff like we've done in the past.  Because, uh, you know, some of those tweets are great.  Yeah, the blacks really know how to tweet. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, boy.  Here's one for, uh, Black History Month.  In honor of Black History Month, the O.B. Anthony Show proudly takes a look at some of the most  inspiring and intellectually stimulating African-Americans on Twitter.  Today's tweet comes from Slime Nasty with an E.  I'm scared.  Who writes?  Why are these niggas so loud at 1030 in the morning?  Take y'all asses to sleep.  Guess I'm woke for now.  Well said. 
[01:21:30]  Slime Nasty.  Stay tuned all month as we continue to celebrate the advancements of the African-American culture here on the O.B. Anthony Show.  O.B. Anthony.  This is the O.B. Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  The Flyers.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to O.B. Anthony.  Who cares if he was disappointed?  Unbelievable. 
[01:22:00]  Uh, it's the O.B. Anthony Show.  No, he's not kidding.  Whatever.  Just fucking.  We got, uh, whatever.  We, uh.  Trying to hold back.  But we got guys down the hall that don't understand jokes.  And their feelings get hurt way too easily.  I, um.  What?  It made my radar.  I know.  It made my radar without, like, you know, asking around.  Well, we were saying that Don.  Ah, forget it.  Just let it go.  Yeah, it just.  Just take the joke and take a little beating. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  It'll be okay.  You know why we don't say, like, it's a joke?  Because, like, you sometimes ruin it by saying things are a joke.  You know?  Just take it.  The point is.  Have a sense of humor.  We're a fucking show that says a lot of nasty shit to each other, to the staff, to fucking management, whatever.  On the air.  On the air.  If you hear it on the air, don't take it all that seriously, okay?  If you need to know the truth, Don Wicklin was awful, and you guys are awful. 
[01:23:00]  So, that's the God's honest truth.  Yeah.  If you really need to know.  But yesterday we were joking how, oh, we missed the days of Don Wicklin because of all the stuff that's going on around here.  The fact is, he was awful, and you guys are awful.  There you go.  There.  That's all.  Now your feelings could really be hurt.  Because we should be going to the Super Bowl.  They fucked that up.  We heard why yesterday.  Oh, well, they had to pass the buck and blame it on sales.  I had no idea, actually.  They blamed it on sales.  Sales couldn't get it together.  As half this fucking company is going to the Super Bowl. 
[01:23:30]  Literally, half the company is going.  But we're not.  And supposedly, I've been told that we're a high-profile show.  I don't believe that whatsoever, but I've been told that.  You know when we're a high-profile show?  Yeah.  When we do things that they don't like.  And then they always say, hey, you know, you guys are a high-profile show.  You can't do this.  You can't take that day off because this show is off.  Or you can't do this material.  You're a high-profile show.  But then when it comes to things like the Super Bowl, ah, we're kind of treated, you 
[01:24:00]  know, like second, third-class citizens.  We should be there.  And the excuse was so lame.  I don't get it.  If we had people that weren't awful, they would figure that stuff out.  Like, oh, Super Bowl is a big deal.  A lot of the company is going down there.  Well, Opie and Anthony certainly should be broadcasting live from there considering  they're one of our high-profile shows.  Yeah.  So I don't care.  Well, I do care it didn't get done.  But the excuse that you passed it on to somebody else is ridiculous.  You didn't know how to get it done.  You know, it's obvious.  You didn't know what it took to get a showdown of the Super Bowl. 
[01:24:30]  You're right about you can't get your feelings hurt when things are said.  Like, anything that's said on the air, I mean, with very few exceptions, especially  if it's in the context of those talks that we're having, it's for the air.  We're having a good time.  We're breaking balls or it's an exaggeration.  And it's like, the guys that run our channel, I think like Tim Sabian runs Howard's channel,  but Tim is used to that shit because he's had so many years of it.  So he knows it just kind of comes with the, I think these guys aren't really used to that 
[01:25:00]  and they kind of take it personally.  And it's like, you can't take it personally.  If I call somebody out by name and you'll know if I really mean it or if I'm just breaking  balls because you're the quote unquote boss.  There's a difference between shitting on the boss when the boss does something stupid,  which we have to do, and being legitimately attacking a person on a personal level.  Yeah.  You guys got to be able to separate that a little bit.  Just, yeah.  Wait a minute.  They're very thin.  Oh my God.  That's not a guy calling saying I did something, right?  No.  Oh my, Garrett in the Bronx. 
[01:25:30]  Go ahead.  I have a problem.  You guys aren't allowed at the Super Bowl, but yet they're using your virus station to  broadcast the fact that everybody in the company is going to the Super Bowl.  Is that, so many people are calling in right now.  There's some kind of promo running that's saying everyone's going to the Super Bowl.  Could you find that?  They're giving, they give.  No, we're allowed at the Super Bowl.  The guys that are in charge of this channel fucked it up and couldn't figure out how to get  us there.  That is exactly what happened.  But they don't want to take responsibility, so they blamed it on the sales guys.  I hear Al Q's going. 
[01:26:00]  I hear Mad Dog's going.  I hear Al Q, no way.  I hear the morning mashup is going.  I hear Covino and Rich, obviously one of those guys works with the mashup, so that wasn't  that big of a stretch.  But there's a lot of fucking people.  Fox Hall is doing interviews.  If you look at the press schedule.  And then you got all the men, a bunch of the executives and stuff are going.  Oh, I bet a bunch of them are going.  And they don't even do radio shows.  Are they going?  Yes!  I bet a bunch of them are going.  Our guys fucked it up.  Simple as that.  How is it that the rest of the company is going and we're not going? 
[01:26:30]  How are we not going to the Super Bowl?  It's stupid.  Exactly.  Because someone fucked it up.  How are we not going?  I know who fucked it up.  But if I say who, he'll have tears in his eyes, so I'll just shut up.  Tears in his eyes, I guess, as you fucked this up.  Although I don't totally let...  I don't know anybody in sales, but I don't totally let them off the hook.  They might have been able to do something.  I'm not saying it's all their fault, but I think it's probably a combination.  How are the rest of these people going?  It's based on other...  I'm sure there's sponsors and sales involved.  Probably much cheaper.  Because they ain't going to fucking pay for everyone to go to the Super Bowl unless they 
[01:27:00]  could figure it out with sales.  The company doesn't like spending money if you haven't figured that out yet.  Oh, I know, man.  Unless you're a movie star that decided to do radio all of a sudden.  There probably was a way to get us down there.  Yeah.  I'm sure we could have got down there and done some good shows.  Oh, man.  Would have been a fucking blast.  That would have been fun.  Yeah.  Like when we did New Orleans, we got so much material.  Literally that dumb master party rock thing. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, my God.  I mean, there were so many funny moments.  We literally got...  One of my favorites.  One of my favorite moments I can't even talk about anymore.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Ant knows.  Ant.  I know what you mean.  One of my favorite moments we can't talk about anymore.  Oh, yeah.  That was a great one.  Oh, my God.  There were so many big laughs down there.  We had fun broadcasts.  Yep.  Knocking hurricane drinks out of people's hands from the bottom.  Oh, my God. 
[01:28:00]  With the fucking beads.  We would ball up the beads.  And then...  Because we were on the balcony.  And then people were walking with their drinks in their hand.  And we would fire the balled-up beads down right into their drinks and knock them out of their hands.  And we made a game out of it.  Oh, and they get pissed.  Hey, uh...  It's amazing how many times we actually did it.  Now...  Good shot.  You know, let's stick with the facts.  Here's the promo that's running.  Maybe it was misrepresented to us through the phone calls.  All right, let's see.  A bunch of phone calls came in about this promo right here.  Keep in mind, we're not going to the Super Bowl.  Hi, I'm Mike Church from SiriusXM Patriot. 
[01:28:30]  And I'm in...  Oh, it got nagled?  No, no, no, no.  Somebody swapped it out.  Somebody just swapped it out because Troy and I just had it in here.  Oh, man.  Why are they taking it out, you fucking faggots?  They're pulling it out from under you?  Holy shit.  That's classic.  Oh, there's a bunch of babies.  What do you mean they took it out?  It changed.  Hang on.  Hold on.  Let's see what happens.  This is the best.  Who pulled it out?  Or is this a nagel?  No, I don't think it's a nagel.  No, somebody is trying to get rid of the evidence before we play it. 
[01:29:00]  This is a hoon wink.  They just...  Are you kidding?  They yanked it out?  Right in the middle of us playing it.  They just yanked it off the machine.  No, come on.  I don't believe that.  That's classic.  That's got to be some weird coincidence.  They're not...  They can't be that bad.  Nobody would be that stupid.  They can't be that bad.  That's fucking funny.  It never existed.  Nobody would pull that when we're talking about playing it.  There's a Stalinism going on.  You got it?  Wow.  We might have another version of it.  Yeah, who's editing commercial logs mid-show? 
[01:29:30]  That's true.  Super Bowl XLV.  Steelers.  Packers.  14 different broadcasts of Super Bowl XLV in 10 languages.  Sirius NFL Radio.  Mad Talk Radio.  Jamie Foxx's.  The Foxhole.  Maurice John Strews.  Fantasy Sports Radio Show.  It's one and more.  All live from North Texas.  Plus the Black Eyed Peas halftime show live in its entirety.  All the sports, music, and entertainment action of Super Bowl XLV is in one place on SiriusXM.  Visit Sirius.com slash Super Bowl XLV. 
[01:30:00]  Holy shit!  They named five shows and then said, and more.  And more.  They said something like 20-something channels are going to be covering it.  Wow, man.  A lot of those are sports channels, but still.  Whatever.  They're able to go.  See, you know, don't blame it on somebody else.  You're just.  It's the same company.  I mean, I want to hear that first one, though.  Yeah, the first one sounded like it was even worse.  Yeah, that one sounded like it was gearing up to be a good one.  It probably says, everyone we value.  Right.  Everyone we hold in high regard will be flown down because we think they can do a good job. 
[01:30:30]  Anyone not seen as dog shit at this company.  Crappy shows will stay back at the studio.  Yes.  Hang out with the Steelers.  Rape with Ben Roethlisberger.  What happened to the first promo?  That is the oddest thing.  Because that one.  Dude, it's like one of those movies where you're trying to get the computer to download something.  And you see the info going away. 
[01:31:00]  And it's like, what's happening?  And somebody's at some remote location fucking with it.  It keeps changing.  That promo's gone.  Now it's a faction promo.  What's your name?  What's your name?  Can we hear it?  Is it on an automatic timer thing?  No.  Can we hear it?  The Super Bowl didn't happen yet.  So they would be playing that still.  No, but I mean, they swap it for a different time.  So it plays a different.  I don't know how it works.  Is there any way to hear it?  Iraq?  Yeah, the one.  You know what?  Troy's saying it's a different card and a different file.  So they're putting different audio into the file.  So could you. 
[01:31:30]  Who just did that?  Yeah.  Who did it?  I don't know.  We found it in the log.  We brought it into the button bar.  Eric, swear to me that you didn't fuck up.  I swear to God, we did not fuck up.  Who has the power right now to have stopped that while you were playing it?  Right when we were talking about it.  Yeah.  I don't know who's here.  I've been sitting back in the morning.  Where would that be done from?  No one knows.  See, this is how conspiracies start.  It could just be a coincidence.  It could just be done from anywhere who has access to these logs and to the commercials.  Oh wait, someone's running into the booth. 
[01:32:00]  Turn around to you.  Uh oh.  Is this bad?  No, no.  Derek's doing something else.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  D-Boy.  D-Boy's always busy.  All right.  Yeah.  D-Boy hitting on his shoes.  Jason in Virginia.  Jason.  It played last break.  What did it say?  What you all just played.  That last bit you guys just played with the 20 channels and all that.  Yeah, but E-Rock was going to play a different version of that.  Yeah.  And it sounded like they were going to name more shows.  Yeah, because he said, hi, I'm Mike Church or something like that.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:32:30]  Okay.  Okay.  All right, boys.  All right.  Thank you.  We really have no say in what they advertise on this channel.  Like when somebody pointed out recently that they were like Russell Brand was being  advertised when he wouldn't come in.  It was like you have no ability just to pull it off.  E-Rock, is he talking to somebody?  I was telling Danny.  The Mike Church one was a promo that they're running for celebrating Reagan's 100th birthday on  one of the political channels.  Okay.  So you did fuck up?  No, the cart changed.  Oh, it changed.  We didn't touch.  We found the cart in the log, put it into the button bar, queued it. 
[01:33:00]  It was the spot.  As soon as we hit play on the air, it was the Mike Church.  It changed instantly.  All right.  At least it makes sense.  Okay.  Well, someone will get it.  All right.  Someone will get it.  Well, I mean, the point is the one we just played kind of proves our point.  A lot of shows are going to the Super Bowl, and for some reason we're not.  Yeah, yeah, we're not.  And we were given some lame excuse yesterday because someone doesn't want to take responsibility.  Didn't we ask?  And now the whole staff and us have to take shit because someone's feelings are hurt because  we're not going to the Super Bowl because, obviously, something had to fuck up because other shows are able to make it happen. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  Why can't we?  Sure.  It's just, it's amazing.  It would have been nice.  I know why.  Because they don't take the show seriously.  So they have people that, hard workers, but do they really know this type of radio?  That's my question.  And if you don't really give a fuck about an actual show, that's exactly what you would  do, is put people in just to put people in. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  That's exactly what happened.  Simple as that.  Since we're on a bitch fest, I got to get this out.  I can't fucking believe it.  What?  The cabs on Long Island are amongst the worst because you've got to call them.  They're like taxi.  You don't have to call them.  Where were you going yesterday?  You needed a cab.  I wasn't.  This is this morning.  Oh, okay.  Melissa's got to get to the train station, right?  Every time I call, I've called a cab to come to my house, whether I've wanted to go to the train station, 
[01:34:30]  because occasionally I come to the city and I know I'm going to get fucked up, so I don't want to drive, so I take the train.  To get picked up by a cab on Long Island is just abominable, and this is great.  She goes, so the cab finally shows up.  They're always late, always fucking late, and when you're on an airport fucking run, every minute counts.  And then you call them back, and they say things like, oh, yeah, yeah, the guy's on his way, he's on his way, 
[01:35:00]  and then the cabbie tells you, oh, I just got dispatched five minutes ago.  And this is after 40 minutes of waiting to stop.  They're all fucking liars, yeah.  They're fucking, fucking liars.  Where is it?  You're a fucking liar.  Exactly.  She goes, here's what she just texted me.  Cab picks me up and had to pick up one of my neighbors as well for some reason.  Now, this is something I think is fucking bullshit.  Yeah, there are a lot of pick up more than one. 
[01:35:30]  Multiple fucking fares.  So sometimes.  During the weather?  No.  No.  Just any time.  Sometimes you're in a cab with somebody you don't even fucking know, and they have to  drive way out of your way to get that person dropped off and then finally drop you off.  This is what happens on Long Island.  No discount, by the way.  You pay the same fucking fare.  That's fucking disgusting.  So get this.  Picked her up.  Had to pick up your neighbor as well.  But she said she wasn't ready to go, so the cab and Melissa left to go to Mineola train  station, but the woman, now the neighbor, called back and said, oh, I am ready. 
[01:36:00]  The cab driver turns around.  They're on their way to the train.  She's got a train to catch.  How fucking.  Turns the fuck around to pick the neighbor up now.  Holy shit.  And she says, now I'm going to be late.  Great.  Now it's going to be tough to get the plane crap, right?  No, it's not the plane.  It's a train.  She's got to come into the city.  She's got jobs.  Oh, you said an airport.  Oh, no.  I thought she was getting the Calumet Z girls back to the airport.  This has happened during airport runs. 
[01:36:30]  Right.  And I'm just going to say, because I said, what is it?  It is All Island Taxi.  That is the shittiest fucking taxi company that exists.  They're constantly late.  They lie to me when I call the dispatcher and ask them where my fucking car is.  All Island Taxi can suck my dead dad's dick.  All Island Taxi can pink sock and fucking eat it.  Eat each other's pink socked assholes. 
[01:37:00]  Just never tip the driver if they do that.  Never tip the driver.  I've stood out there.  You're so enraged.  I know.  She'll talk about the tip part at that point.  She'll do anything you can do.  Yeah.  And believe me.  And they're all scary, too.  Oh, boy, Melissa's catching on quickly, too.  She goes, and, of course, the driver is a smelly, and then there's a word I can't say.  This, by the way, was a very liberal-minded, like, oh, the language.  What's better than when you turn them?  Oh, I love turning them. 
[01:37:30]  Dude, I love turning them.  When certain words elicit, like, a look of, like, oh, what did you just say?  It's like, oh, believe me, you'll get used to it.  You'll start using it in no time.  I'm in just the opposite, Jim.  I have to try to tell her, like, I understand that's a great word, but you don't have to  use it twice in the same sentence.  Your chick is a dream come true.  You don't understand.  She is sent from Jesus.  She uses it as a proper noun.  It is. 
[01:38:00]  But I love that.  I've just read that.  It's like, look at this.  It looks like one from your girl.  Isn't it great to read in print from a girl that never fucking wouldn't use that language?  It's just, it's hysterical.  All Island Taxi can suck my fucking cock.  I have to find another taxi company because every time I've called them, they're late.  I call the dispatcher.  He blatantly fucking lies to me.  You can say whatever you want.  They're laughing at you. 
[01:38:30]  I know.  I know.  Because I think they're the only one.  They don't care.  I don't think there's another cab company out there.  That two, three people to a fucking cab bullshit?  Fuck you.  Here's my money.  Take me from point A to point B.  I don't want to stop anywhere else.  I want to fucking go.  I'm not fucking.  Then I'm paying half.  If you're getting two fares, I pay half.  They pay half.  I'm going to go local.  I don't want a tour of Oyster Bay before I get to Huntington Village.  Thank you.  Exactly.  That was real good for about 10 people out there.  Fuck.  Ah, so now, I mean, she's got fucking jobs to do here in the city. 
[01:39:00]  See, my experience is they've all been crazy white people.  Oh, no, no, no.  Crazy, lunatic, white drivers.  They're assorted on Long Island.  I've never.  They're kind of assorted.  You do get the crazy white cab driver, which are just, they're insane.  They're fucking insane.  Sorry, Big A.  But, yeah, well, see?  Exactly.  Sorry, Big A.  But you do occasionally get your typical cab drivers and stuff like that.  But Big A's hobbies, he likes to eat healthy food while watching autopsies. 
[01:39:30]  He likes to pull up a chair in an autopsy and eat a salad, a little pepper.  Sorry, Ant.  No, that's good.  Let me say hi to Poop Smears.  Poop Smears.  He's got some knowledge.  Poop Smears.  Hi, boys.  What's up, Poop?  Hey, I want to know if Anthony heard the story about Bloomberg, your cunt of a mayor,  sending some sting operation into Arizona to buy fucking handguns. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, I got to be honest with you.  I'm not 100% on this one, on the side of the NRA and guns, believe it or not.  This is probably the first.  Bloomberg, though, should keep his fucking schnoz out of the rest of the country's shit.  Take care of New York.  How much did that cost, you fucking twat, Bloomberg?  He sent an investigator to Arizona to a gun show to buy a pistol without any kind of background check. 
[01:40:30]  Um, and the guy stated something to the effect of, uh, there's no background checks.  And the guy said no.  And he goes, oh, good, because I probably wouldn't pass it anyway.  Uh, and the guy sold him a gun anyway.  Now, that is out of hand.  You can't, you can't fucking sell a guy a gun like that.  It's, it's crazy.  But it's not Bloomberg's fucking place.  How about Arizona?  How about Arizona sends investigators to New York to find out about, uh, state corruption 
[01:41:00]  and fucking, uh, uh, money that's being flushed down the toilet?  How about that?  How about other states just start investigating Bloomberg's fucking asshole?  How about, how about, uh, his sex life?  Why don't we send an investigator in and find out if Michael Bloomberg is gay?  Why don't we do that?  How about Idaho does that?  Just sends an investigator in and pokes around with a camera to see if our mayor here is gay.  How about that?  Why don't you, why don't you do that?  But, uh, he sent an investigator to, uh, Arizona and he did find some improprieties. 
[01:41:30]  I'll be honest.  It, they should not have sold that guy a fucking gun.  That investigator should not have sold him a gun.  Uh, things, the, the laws that are in place have to be upheld and strictly enforced.  We don't need new laws.  There's plenty of good laws in place that'll keep fucking, uh, guns out of the hands of,  uh, uh, kooks and, and whatever.  And you're always going to get those that'll slip through.  And you're never going to be a hundred percent.  You can't catch every fucking fan guy. 
[01:42:00]  A lunatic became a major in the army.  Hassan was, you know, or they become cops.  It does happen.  Right.  But there are, uh, improprieties going on at gun shows as far as selling, uh, guns, um,  without identifications, selling guns with other people's background checks.  And then the guy just hands another guy a gun.  These are illegal procedures.  You're not supposed to do this.  Straw purchases.  They're called, um, those have to be enforced.  Yeah.  I'm, I'm all for enforcing those laws that are already in place.  Uh, so that guns don't get in the hands of, uh, people that shouldn't have them. 
[01:42:30]  But for, for our dumb fuck ass mayor, and again, this is just step one.  I'm never going to think that Bloomberg would get something passed and then stop and say,  all right, our gun problems are solved.  Our third term mayor.  Yeah.  Our third term mayor who made up his own third term.  Uh, and then, and then put a law that said no other mayor can do that.  What a fucking, what an arrogant scumbag he is.  Yeah.  He is an arrogant scumbag.  You're right.  Decided he was going to go to, uh, Arizona because there's not enough problems here in 
[01:43:00]  New York.  We are, our fucking transit system is broke and fucking broken.  Uh, uh, we're, we're in a financial crisis and he's blowing hundreds of thousands of dollars  on investigators to go to Arizona to, to try to find out how guns are being bought.  Just shows we have enough money.  Yeah.  Could Julianne come back?  Is he legally allowed to run again?  He doesn't know.  He doesn't want to deal with this.  Hey, how about he just signs a paper that says, yes, he can, just like Bloomberg did.  Yeah.  How about you do that?  Fucking asshole.  All right, poop. 
[01:43:30]  Always a pleasure.  So a lot of people were tweeting me, asking me how I felt about that.  And now we know.  Yeah.  I don't, you know, I'm not totally against people keeping guns out of assholes hands,  but, um, for Bloomberg, it's, he's gotten it.  Bloomberg has a very set and distinct agenda and it is totally anti-gun.  So I really, uh, I don't trust him that this is where he would stop and that this is, uh,  his, uh, big project and he wouldn't go any further after it. 
[01:44:00]  So that's, that's where I'm at there.  Thank you.  End of, uh, story.  End of story.  End of story.  I can't.  So to speak.  Happy birthday, faggot.  I am totally, I am totally on the, uh, on the Fargo page today.  That's all I'm doing.  There's a car!  There's a car!  I am one of my favorites.  You know, Jose Feliciano, you got no complaints.  Yeah, you know.  Jose Feliciano, you got no complaints.  That's such a...  And he's just watching Jose Feliciano. 
[01:44:30]  Is it really him?  Yeah.  That's so funny.  It's Jose Feliciano.  Jose Feliciano, you got no complaints.  You got no complaints.  And, you know, you don't.  He's there with his fucking ugly whore hooker, drinking some beers, watching Jose Feliciano.  He's like a casino show.  Yeah, yeah, it was like a...  It was a hotel show.  It was at the celebrity room.  The celebrity room.  Yeah, it was in the celebrity room.  It's classic, man.  One of my faves.  It's one of the greats.  It really is. 
[01:45:00]  All right.  I want to go to a pancakes house.  I'm fucking hungry now, you know.  You know.  Fucking pancakes.  I love it.  You know.  I'm going to go to break with Uncle Nino's Bad Jokes and Wine.  Oh, wow.  I remember Vinny's uncle from the Jersey Shore.  Was there a little something put together?  Something was put together by the boys.  Let's take a listen to this.  And after the break, I want to talk to Mars because I filmed a little of the J-Lo, Jim  Norton autograph picture thing yesterday. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  And everyone is pointing out who was the asshole that went bang when J-Lo's ass walked by the  window.  Ew.  Is that on camera?  Yeah.  Ew.  He didn't go bang.  I think it was bang, right?  Did he put, like, a mad face on, too?  Dude, he went bang!  Like, that's right.  Look at that.  So I want to talk to Mars about J-Lo's ass because he lost his fucking mind yesterday when  she walked by the studio.  But first, Uncle Nino doing some bad jokes and drinking some wine.  You know him as Vinny's lovable uncle from MTV's Jersey Shore. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, what the fuck?  Now the Sicilian funny man brings his act straight off the boat and on to Broadway.  Listen, no, I gotta say something.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  Let me fucking talk.  Uncle Nino presents Bad Jokes and Wine.  I've been drinking all fucking week.  We're making toast to the crack that never heals.  The more you rub it, the better it feels.  You can scrub it from here to hell.  You never get rid of that fishy smell.  I'm fucking for me.  I'm fucking for me.  Come see what nobody else will as the stereotypical Italian recites line after line of adolescent 
[01:46:30]  toilet humor.  First I met sex.  I was so scared.  I was all by myself.  I says, I was with this guy.  He says, I need to sit in.  He says, yes.  Well, start walking towards me now.  Oh.  I asked this guy.  He says, buddy.  He says, did you ever see the numbers on the condoms?  He says, what numbers?  So I guess you don't have to roll the back down for you.  Why?  Oh.  Never before has an offensive cartoonish caricature told so many bad jokes in one hour, writes  the Daily News.  I laughed once, then wondered why I had, said the New York Post. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, I have to say one last thing.  I'll shut up.  I promise I'll shut up.  I love black women.  I always take a shot in the dark.  And when asked, the New York Times said they didn't bother to show up and review it.  I was with this girl.  I says, miss, did you ever have a 16-second orgasm?  She says, no.  She says, you got a fucking minute?  What the fuck?  You know what I mean?  It's Uncle Nino's Bad Jokes and Wine. 
[01:47:30]  And God bless everybody.  Who gives a fuck?  Live on Broadway for as long as people still give a shit about the Jersey Shore.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Opie and Anthony.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Serious.  I got to bring up something from yesterday's show.  We had...  Old school rock.  Wow, I was about to say we had J-Lo on the show. 
[01:48:00]  I felt like we had her on the show yesterday.  It felt like it because she walked in front of our studio a couple of times.  She looked lovely, too.  She walked...  Yeah, she walked in front of our studio three times.  There was a whole thing going on with Jimmy and his picture.  And would she sign the picture?  Yeah.  It was a big deal yesterday.  Hopefully you heard it because it was pretty funny stuff.  Oh, yeah.  I made a video about it.  It's on my YouTube channel, Opie Radio.  And I wasn't even going to bring anyone's attention on the show today. 
[01:48:30]  It is what it is, and it's pretty cool, whatever.  But then I was reminded that Mars' reaction in the video is so ridiculous.  It's so over the top.  It's so over the top.  That's all people are talking about as far as this particular video goes.  Yeah, it's way over the top.  It's somebody...  Somebody would do that that is probably a little less mature than you, Mars, is what I'm saying.  And, Mars, how many kids you got at home?  Three.  And you've been married a while. 
[01:49:00]  And you're doing this during this video.  It's more of a visual, unfortunately, but we'll be able to explain it if you haven't seen the video.  Is the audio good, Danny?  Yeah, it's good enough.  It's good enough?  Okay.  You could definitely hear it.  And the way you try to relate with Patrice in this is just fantastic.  Yeah, you're not going to get anything from Patrice.  You lock eyes with them, hoping...  You know, you're almost hoping for an up top, Patrice.  Yeah, you're hoping...  Up top with me.  You're hoping Patrice is going to give you a bang back.  I don't like your attempt at minority bonding.  Yeah, yeah.  Can we see it?  All right, let's start with this. 
[01:49:30]  Yay, Jimmy!  Just to set it up, J-Lo is about to walk by our studio for the last time.  And, of course, every time she walked by, we stopped the show just to look.  Yeah, we'd have to look at J-Lo's famous ass.  And I remember this moment.  It was uncomfortable in person.  It's going to be worse now.  You do remember this.  Of course I do.  Of course I do.  All right, here it is.  Ain't happening, man.  All right, here we go.  J-Lo's now.  All right, she's walking. 
[01:50:00]  Bang!  Bang!  Bang!  Bang!  Ah!  Bang, baby!  Bang!  Later today, I'm making a video of Mars' reaction to J-Lo's butt.  It's got to be...  That's got to be looped at least 20 times.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  At least 20 times.  And then a slow-mo...  Bang, baby, baby!  Bang!  Wait, does he walk back into frame at all?  Can you let this play?  Because there might be a further humiliation.  He still has to be... 
[01:50:30]  He still has to be...  Wait.  No, then it becomes...  Hold on.  Oh, there's Mars over there.  He's calmed down.  Yeah, now he's chilled.  Yeah.  Chilled out.  It's the only way...  Let me see the bang, baby, bang again.  Oh, it's fucking horrible.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, Mars, you want to try to explain yourself on this one?  Yeah.  Well, let's see it again.  You're right.  Let's see it again.  This shit ain't happening, man.  All right, here we go.  J-Lo's now.  All right, here we go.  All right, she's walking.  Bang!  Bang!  Bang!  Bang! 
[01:51:00]  Oh!  And you're looking at Patrice like you want to kill him or something.  Yeah, it's not...  You got that ghetto look like, yeah, right?  You feeling me?  It wasn't...  No, it wasn't about give it to me at the top.  It was more like convincing him that...  It's the only way you could get your point across.  Yeah, but look at Travis's face.  Oh, to those type of terrible people.  Wow.  Danny turns his head.  Everyone's smiling.  Patrice is...  I'm sure I can't see Patrice, but I'm sure he's doing some smug like...  He made us uncomfortable.  You can't appreciate that piece of ass?  Sure we can.  We all appreciate it. 
[01:51:30]  Your reaction.  By the first time, all three of us at the same time, by the way, said, holy shit, but  you just went over the top like you were 12.  I got a little overzealous.  She's always been a person that I would love to see up close.  Bang!  You want to say that?  Bang!  Bang!  Bang!  If you want to bang.  Yeah.  It wasn't that your expression of manliness.  We all agreed that we would have let her shit in our mouths.  I think I speak for the group.  I think I can speak for everybody here.  But...  Does Mike Rowe have some of that on his finger right now?  Oh, God.  I do.  The commercial with the sludge oil on his finger. 
[01:52:00]  That was perfect timing on Jimmy's.  Yeah.  I looked up and there's Mike Rowe with some shit on his finger right there.  He's got that engine gunk oil.  Try ink from the fucking other contract he signed.  I know.  Jesus, does he make a lot of dough?  Enough with Mike Rowe on every commercial.  You know what?  In the end, the whiskey didn't help.  He just doesn't...  We lost him.  We dissed him.  We didn't mean to diss him.  We'll get back to Mars in a second, but we had Victoria Gotti in.  I know.  And she was a bit wordy, and we didn't know how to shut her up, because she's John Gotti's...  I'm not going to tell her to shut her up. 
[01:52:30]  Did we lose Mike for good?  I think we lost him for good.  But we had a good segment with him, but he likes to hang for the whole show.  We did 20, 30 minutes with him.  And then Victoria Gotti came in.  We thought we'd get back to Mike Rowe.  We never did, because none of us talked.  We just listened to her for an hour straight.  He does great radio, too.  And then I think it was a bottle of whiskey.  We got him a bottle of Blue Label.  Blue Label.  Yeah.  And, oh, here's Roland.  Do you have an update on Mike Rowe?  Oh.  Look at him.  He's just...  Is he limping?  I don't know.  Roland.  I hope so. 
[01:53:00]  Are you limping?  Are you limping?  Are you limping?  I have to take a crap.  Jesus Christ.  He is the best.  No, but I just can't bite you.  No, Mike's coming to the studio.  I talked to him.  He's fine.  I blinked some people.  Backed the bus up.  And they go, oh, okay.  I saw you guys.  I think he had March or April.  You sure?  Oh, yeah.  I just talked to him like a month ago.  Oh, God.  Thank God.  Because I really thought he was out.  No, no.  He's good.  I've been assuming he's been out for months.  All right.  He's got to shit. 
[01:53:30]  He's got to go.  Why don't you go fucking...  God, that is going to just wreck the toilet.  You know what it's going to look like?  It's going to look like the stump left after lightning strikes a tree.  That pile with the...  It's a little pointy.  Yeah, but just thick, like a thick tree stump.  Shit.  Roland takes tree stump shits.  That is just a wrecker.  They're like bodybuilder calves, all his shits.  That's really funny.  Mars, you're going to explain yourself or what?  Mars, comment. 
[01:54:00]  Your reaction was...  It was a little uncomfortable.  It was a little over the top for what it was.  Did you say bang?  Yes, I did.  Twice.  Yes, I did.  Why?  No one says that.  Because the brothers all think that the only ones with the nice big asses are sisters,  and he always has this...  But her ass is notoriously good.  Everyone agrees.  Exactly.  That's my point.  You don't have to be black to have that type of ass.  The Ricans got the nice asses.  Yeah, so do white girls.  Yeah.  I think Ricans have better asses than black girls.  No, because...  Well...  Most black girls like a lot of salt in their eyes. 
[01:54:30]  Black girl asses are too big.  Too much.  Too much.  Latina girls got...  If you like a bubble ass...  Yep.  Latin girls got good asses for that.  I like regular, you know, skinny white chicks.  But that's just me.  Right.  Black chicks, too big.  Too big.  Too big.  A bit intimidating.  You know, Italians also...  They're coming with some hefty...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  ...matches.  They got the little heavy bottom.  But why bang?  I don't know. 
[01:55:00]  Why the angry...  Did you snap, too?  The gangster walk away.  I think there was a snap in there, too.  I was very excited.  I saw J-Lo.  Did you say, that's what I'm talking about?  That's right, baby.  That's what I'm talking about.  That's what I'm talking about.  You weren't talking about it.  Yeah, no one was talking about it.  I was trying to prove a point to old Patrice.  Do you know what you did?  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  His reaction is the exact reaction I give when I hit blackjack on a $16,000 hand.  That's it.  I go, bang, yeah!  That's what I'm talking about. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, but you got $16,000.  You didn't get anything out of that.  I got close to her.  I got close to her.  Yeah, and then, you know what's so funny is like, man, you got together with the rest  of the...  Puerto Ricans?  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Thank you, you...  Because if I said it...  You would have gotten in trouble.  We would have gotten in trouble.  Holy shit, Danny.  Because we can't...  Yes.  You have to walk around here and make believe everyone is the exact same caller.  Exactly.  And you notice...  Speaking of the ass, by the way...  There was an entourage of Puerto Ricans.  Look at the side of that shelf ass in the Daily News.  I thought you were going to say, Kenny, come in here. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, the Daily News got a nice picture of J-Lo signing the...  Sanctioned wall.  The sanctioned wall.  You look good.  No, but Mars said it, but when everyone got word J-Lo was coming around, Mars searched out his  brothers.  Excuse me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They searched me out.  They searched them out.  But you guys were all hanging out like a little pack.  Exactly.  Yep.  Waiting for the J-Lo.  Doing some wilding.  What's the matter, sweetie?  Getting ready to do some wilding.  Some wilding on J-Lo.  A wilding.  Not with that monster she had with her.  Is that that guy?  Oh, shit.  Who's that? 
[01:56:30]  Alexis Texas.  Would you smell it?  That's Alexis Texas.  Yes, sir.  I would eat anything that came out of it.  Look at that.  Let me see her ass a little of us.  Look at that white girl.  That's awesome.  That's my big ass.  Yeah, but you're not going to get a bang out of us.  It's amazing.  Jimmy, she's got a thing with Belladonna you would love.  Oh, I would love that.  I love porno.  She's got to have a little more than white in her to get an ass to that.  Honestly, she has a Puerto Rican...  I know.  Bang.  Bang. 
[01:57:00]  That's what I'm talking about.  And the way he turns and looks at Patrice is like he's going to fight him.  You picked the wrong guy.  Patrice is not going to give you anything back.  Even if he was thinking the exact same thing.  Patrice is the one that said, she's like 40 years old.  That ass got to be fucking...  That ass is dropping.  That ass is dropping to the floor.  You should take them pants off that...  Get the floor, motherfucker.  I learned my lesson with Patrice about getting anything back.  One day he was coming up the hallway and I was like, yo, brother, what's going on?  Give love to the Latino.  He left me hanging.  I said, fuck you too, guys.  White and Latinos can... 
[01:57:30]  Fuck.  You ain't black.  If it was a black guy, he wouldn't do it.  Patrice just wouldn't do it.  Where are you at with anyone?  Where are you at with Vida?  Is she the ultimate ass?  No.  To be honest...  Remember, she was all about the ass for about two, three years straight.  I was telling people this, that J-Lo...  Guerrera or something like that?  Guerrera.  Vida Guerra.  Guerra?  Yeah.  J-Lo is the second person that I've seen up in close and personal that actually looks  better than in TV or in pictures. 
[01:58:00]  Who's this bitch?  This is the best thing I've ever seen in my entire life.  Her name is Kira Augustina.  It's by far...  She was just some chick.  I don't know where she came from.  Let me see his face.  She's retarded.  Holy shit.  She's literally retarded?  That's great.  I love that.  I've never seen an ass this...  It's so easy to fuck.  It's perfect.  It's just perfect.  It's all shiny, too.  Yeah, she's greased up that ass.  She's shiny enough for you.  Oh, man.  Holy shit.  What's her face look like?  Yeah, what's that face look like?  Let me see that grill. 
[01:58:30]  She's very different.  Let me see that grill.  Does she look like a burn victim?  Like the counselor on Celebrity Rehab with that dumb hat?  I'm obsessed with his awful hat and wig.  You're watching Celebrity Rehab?  Yeah.  A little bit?  Whatever his name is.  I don't know what his name is.  I always forget his name.  Bob or something.  His fucking hat and awful wig are embarrassing.  Wig.  Is it a wig?  Is it a wig?  I never knew.  It's like Sandy Duncan's hair.  That's why the hat? 
[01:59:00]  Fucking hideous.  I did not know that.  You like Celebrity Rehab?  It's okay.  What don't you like about it?  They're not hard enough on them.  I mean, they're newer to recovery, but I think sometimes you have to tell someone,  you know what?  You don't want to do it?  Bye.  I think we talked about it, but my biggest problem with Celebrity Rehab is the fact  that Dr. Drew's not acknowledging the obvious, which is that they're addicted to fame.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which puts him in a weird spot, obviously, because he's got a hit on his hands.  Yeah, but they're really addicted to fame more than what they're using. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  They can't wait to get on that show and tell the world they're smoking.  I'm doing crack.  Yeah.  And then fuck up and be like the big person of the show for that season.  What?  Yeah.  Speaking of crack.  What the hell's going on there?  Holy shit.  Nice ass pictures.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  I haven't seen one.  Let me see this girl's shitter.  Oh, look at the one with the little boy shorts.  Oh, wait.  What was that bikini one?  She knows how to wear the boy shorts. 
[02:00:00]  Look at that.  That's good.  That's a honey.  That's a nice boy.  What's her name?  Who is this bitch?  My name is Kira.  K-E-Y-R-A.  Augustina.  Do you think she knows she has a nice ass?  She has 8,000 ass pics of her.  They're all ass pics.  I know.  If there's any more ass pictures,  you don't have to go in.  Is this a glossary?  Why does duty have to come out of something so lovely?  Why?  Why does duty have to come out of that?  I like what you like to read this song.  Why can't duty come out of your fucking heel? 
[02:00:30]  It's like beauty.  It's like beauty and the beast.  Right.  Why?  And if they're a little lazy,  then it takes the goodness away.  That really is like the hottest thing,  and then just shit.  And you know that duty comes out of it.  Oh, it's made for shit.  Why couldn't God figure out where,  put a hole somewhere else that you don't give a shit about, right?  Do you like the way the thong disappears between the cheeks?  I like everything about that.  Is she the one in those white,  that famous picture in those white shorts?  Yes, the white tight,  like they're painted on pretty much.  Was she a Spanish girl? 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  From where?  Spain.  You know what?  I'm not, I can't remember.  What does she do?  Is she a model?  She got, well,  she got famous because of these pictures.  Yeah, yeah.  She ended up,  she ended up in like the Mexican Maxim  or some shit like that,  whatever,  or FHM,  something like that.  But it came from some,  just some site,  like where hot chicks get posted,  and she kind of made a little career out of it.  Oh, I'd love to smell her ass,  like, oh, I've been cutting gassers.  That's all right.  Oops.  I had some beans.  Yeah, she's just delicious.  She's just delicious.  Hey, thank you, Mars.  So you looked like a complete idiot yesterday, 
[02:01:30]  and we appreciate it.  Look at that fucking dick.  Hey,  I saw a movie last night.  Did you see a movie last night, Jimmy?  Did you see a movie, Anthony?  No, I didn't.  I didn't watch any movies last night.  I was watching news.  I was watching,  well, I watch when I work out sometimes.  It gets me through the workout.  Oh.  So what do you like?  You've got to work out to something probably,  you know.  I rented.  Big.  Wait, can I ask you a question before?  Because I know this is going to get ugly.  You just said something that, 
[02:02:00]  can I take my iPad to the gym and watch a movie?  Yes, you can on your.  Netflix?  I do it on.  No, you just download,  you can rent it from iTunes,  so it's on there.  Right.  You don't have to stream it.  And once it's on your iPad,  I do it to my laptop,  and then transfer because it's faster.  And then you can put it on top of the elliptical,  put your headphones in,  just watch the movie while you're working out.  Holy shit.  But you only have,  rentals on iTunes suck because once you start watching them,  you only have 24 hours to finish.  Oh, yeah, I don't care about that.  But you can do that over two workouts.  But I could do a little Netflix.  Yeah, it gets me an hour on the. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, because I get bored on those dumb machines.  If I got a movie that I wanted to see,  the time will fly by.  So I saw Exit to the Gimp Shop.  The music doesn't do it anymore.  How great is that movie?  Very fucking good, man.  I'm waiting for Ant to see it,  and then we got to have a full discussion on this.  Yeah, it's very, very good.  Yeah.  What did you like about it?  I already knew the story because Jonathan told me,  but...  You liked the Banksy.  Banksy's interesting.  I mean, it also showed what dummies people are in L.A.,  although that can happen anywhere,  but what sheep people are.  But who are the dummies? 
[02:03:00]  Like, is this a gag on us,  the people watching the movie?  No, I mean, I was wondering to myself,  is this a documentary about street art  that Banksy wanted to get out there?  But then I thought, no, it's not.  It's actually legit.  Basically, the movie is,  they turn the camera on the guy  that was actually filming all the street guys.  Yeah, he winds up having a weird, this art shit.  And then he becomes, like, the focus of the entire movie.  And then this guy, Banksy, who's legendary,  that people don't really know what he even looks like.  No one knows who he is.  His art sells for millions and millions of dollars. 
[02:03:30]  He's a fucking...  He's very good, though.  I mean, it's really interesting stuff he does.  Street art.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's interesting.  You know, the Obey.  Well, that's the other guy, though.  San Francisco.  Shepard Ferry.  Yes, thank you.  Shepard Ferry is the Obey.  That's the pop.  That's like the pop.  He's the one that did Obama's thing.  The pop-slash street art that's going on.  Yeah, this is Banksy.  So then Banksy turns the cameras on the guy  that was actually supposed to put this documentary  about street art together.  And then Banksy kind of tells him  to become one of these street artists. 
[02:04:00]  And then he does.  And then he has a show in L.A.  And then it brings us to where Jimmy's at,  where it shows how stupid people in L.A. are,  because they go to this art show  and start buying his shit for a lot of fucking money.  Something was okay, though.  So then you're wondering, is that a goof?  Like, did he even make that art?  Did Banksy make that art and say,  no, we're going to make believe you made the art?  No.  Like, there's a lot going on with this movie  that I'm still wondering about.  I don't want to blow it for him,  but they show how the art got made.  It's very interesting, and it's amazing 
[02:04:30]  what dummies people are.  It's one of my favorite movies in a long time.  So yeah, I wanted to see that documentary.  I wanted to see a movie.  I wanted to see Twilight.  So I bought it.  But it was $19.99 on iTunes,  and I bought it in HD.  So I didn't finish watching.  I've only watched half,  because I did it in the gym.  So it was like an hour  while I was on the elliptical machine.  Hold on, hold on.  Yeah. 
[02:05:00]  You've got to go back to the part  about what did you actually purchase?  Twilight.  Twilight.  I hope you're leaving a word out,  like the, and then zone movie.  Or something.  Because.  No.  You mean the vampire.  Yeah, I wanted to see that.  Tween fucking hit sensation  with the vampire guys  that all the girls love,  and the stupid fucking love story 
[02:05:30]  between vampire and.  You watched that.  I did, and it's funny.  I've been trying,  I've been wanting to see it.  Why?  Because it looked,  in Ozzy's concert,  he does these.  Oh boy,  I knew it would have to come down to Ozzy.  No, he goofs on these,  whenever pop culture videos are popular,  like they,  they, you know,  they green screen him in  and he makes an ass out of himself  like Jersey Shore.  It was very funny this year.  And one of the ones was,  there's a scene in the woods  where he picks her up  and he runs up a hill with her  and Ozzy parodied that. 
[02:06:00]  Except when he opened his shirt,  you know,  he had tits.  You know,  it's just typical Ozzy silliness.  Of course.  But I'm like,  oh my God,  that movie kind of would probably be,  I'd like to see that.  And I said to my girlfriend,  like,  let's watch that.  And she's like,  are you a faggot?  No.  Like,  she really was.  That's your girlfriend again.  Totally right.  Brutal.  No.  Like,  that type of.  Yeah,  but she's right.  Why would you want to,  that movie is custom made  for,  like,  tweens.  The Justin Bieber crowd.  Right.  But I just wanted to see it. 
[02:06:30]  And I liked what I saw.  I mean,  again,  there's certain lines in it.  Certain lines in it that are like,  ah,  it's a high school movie line or whatever.  Like,  you know,  but just the fact that the guy likes a vampire,  I mean,  a chick likes a vampire.  It's this dumb little love story.  She's fucking sexy.  Very cute.  Oh,  don't try to fucking change it into something that,  you know,  you watched it because it's odd.  No,  no,  no,  no,  but I'm saying,  and the idea of the story so far is pretty cool.  It's not,  you know,  it's just a different vampire story.  Yeah.  It's not scary,  but you know,  who cares? 
[02:07:00]  It's scary that you're watching it.  That's what's scary.  Like fucking,  what's wrong?  Look,  sometimes you want to just have some chamomile tea and put a Snuggie on and watch a movie about vampires.  You're,  uh,  did you get a little emotional?  Cause I,  I would,  I would assume that it's probably one of these,  you know,  fucking like,  I don't know what's going to happen.  I'll watch the end of it when I get home.  Um,  I'll watch the second half today.  Yeah.  Um,  no,  but my,  my,  my eyes were bothering me when E.T. 
[02:07:30]  was on to the day.  I think I told you that.  Oh,  right.  You tweeted something about that.  You were watching E.T.  What part got you all misty?  I think it misty.  I was just saying there was something in my eyes when he was laying in the incubator with Elliot.  Oh,  and they were like,  Elliot was dying.  I hadn't seen that in so long.  Yeah.  But as we're watching it,  I'm like,  yeah,  this must be some misty,  something in the air.  It's bothering my eyes.  I should go take a shower.  I should go take a shower.  I openly wept.  Oh,  but it's okay. 
[02:08:00]  It ends fine.  You know,  aside from the fact that he has to leave E.T.  Yeah,  Elliot's lonely and shitty.  Yeah.  Did you cry at the end too?  I didn't see the end.  I was in the shower.  You guys watching the,  whatever was in your eyes out?  Yeah,  I had to,  I had to Mars it up.  I was like,  yeah,  I had to get myself.  Bang.  You're such a sweet boy.  Jimmy's a sweet boy,  but I'm,  I'm a,  I don't know why I'm,  but I can literally go,  then I can go to blood shows and watch a man burned alive for an indeterminate crime. 
[02:08:30]  It doesn't really make sense.  it doesn't make sense.  I can watch blood gutted,  which is the Chechnians,  Muslim Chechnians were opening the throats of the other soldiers and they weren't killing them.  They were just slicing their throats almost to the back of their neck,  letting them bleed out.  See,  that doesn't make sense.  You know,  guys were like,  I can never watch that.  Oh my God.  I can never watch that.  That's terrible.  I never watched that.  It's not good.  And then he's crying at ET.  I know,  it's,  I'm watching Twilight.  If we're sharing,  I'll tell you what made me cry recently and it goes back to celebrity rehab.  Contract? 
[02:09:00]  Yeah,  I'm still crying over that.  I'm still fucking crying over that.  Which celebrity rehab?  Because I've seen a lot of them this year.  Rachel,  you could tell,  you could tell,  right?  Her thing is that,  you know,  well,  her thing is that she had sex with Tiger Woods,  but they,  I guess they basically can't say that.  She's probably signing non-disclosure.  but so she's in this celebrity rehab and it's very vague why she's there.  And she lost her fiance on 9-11.  Yeah.  My,  my girl,  my wife,  because I've seen it twice now,  actually looked over at me on the couch and went, 
[02:09:30]  oh,  oh,  no,  ew.  I know,  I know.  But it kills me to this day because I remember 9-11 like it was yesterday.  Like most of us,  especially us hanging out and living here in New York.  And she went down to ground zero and ran into another survivor,  a guy who lost.  And they had a little exchange and it just kills me.  I hated that scene.  It fucking kills me.  Why?  I remember because it was fat.  You think it was fabricated?  No,  I think,  I think they went down there.  Basically,  celebrity rehab, 
[02:10:00]  uh,  leaves like we have unfinished business with Rachel after they all quote,  graduate from their,  uh,  weekend at the celebrity rehab house.  They have bullshit.  Yeah.  And then they go down to ground zero with Rachel.  You could tell just because she's never been there.  So they film her and what are you feeling?  And all that.  And she just happens to run into this guy.  That's pretty much there every day because he lost his wife.  And he's like still,  you know,  I think he's sincere.  Yeah.  But it just was too short.  You saw that scene.  It didn't bother you?  No,  it annoyed me.  I was like,  yeah,  I said to my chick,  I was like,  this fucking is annoying.  Really?  Yeah.  I wasn't afraid to be emotional. 
[02:10:30]  She,  the guy walks up to,  look,  she's a 10 and the guy walks up to her and just starts bonding with her in front of a camera.  And then he hugs her.  I was like,  oh,  fuck off.  Like if she,  if it was a private moment that they had filmed from far away,  it would have been different.  Yeah.  But who wouldn't walk up to the hot chick with the 10 and hug her?  Thank God we have a bond.  Let me put those tits against me.  Well,  he said like,  he was curious.  He's like,  I'm wondering what they were filming.  And then,  uh,  he went up.  He seemed,  he seemed sincere.  I'm sure he was.  I got to stick up for the guy.  But I think he was just,  I think he was just overly, 
[02:11:00]  uh,  I don't know.  It just annoyed me.  It did annoy you?  Oh,  wow.  Okay.  Yeah.  But that's why.  No,  it got to me twice.  Cause then I watched the reunion special and they redid the scene again.  Did your girl get said?  Um,  she wasn't laughing at me.  Cause she laughs at me a lot.  Dumb things I do,  but.  Uh,  no,  I don't think she did.  She felt,  she felt bad for me.  And I said,  I just remember,  you know,  that time was just so fucking brutal to live through. 
[02:11:30]  I've been very touched by nine 11 stories.  Just not that,  not their combination.  That one didn't get you.  Yeah.  That one got me.  Cause her big fat titsy at the hugger.  It would have been sadder for me if it was a woman who approached her,  not an older guy who had the same motives I would have had,  which is to feel those fat fucking tiger woods,  humping $5 million fat,  juicy Gloria all red content against my chest.  And he,  and she fucked the talent right out of him because he sucks.  Yeah.  Cause now he's had a,  an off season to get his shit back together. 
[02:12:00]  And first tournament back,  he came in 44th place,  44th place.  Uh,  no,  it's a,  that's,  that's,  yeah,  that's real old.  Oh,  as you can see.  Okay.  Um,  uh,  he came in 44th place in a tournament that he usually fucking kills at.  Oh,  ran for their lives after that.  And they never saw it.  This is not it,  right?  Yeah,  no,  that's not it.  We watched this random 9-11 videos.  The towers are still there.  That's her.  That's what she used to look like.  Oh,  that was her.  Yeah,  that was her,  man.  She was all over the news when a 9-11 hit. 
[02:12:30]  Huh?  Oh,  okay.  Cause she was like begging for,  for people to find her,  um,  fiance.  And she had the,  she was one of those girls.  I was on TV a lot with the picture and all that.  Do I want to lick her?  I want to lick from the back of her neck,  down her ass,  crack up her pussy,  scrape her tits,  then give her a peck.  Right in her nose.  She's,  she's not hot when she takes those sunglasses off.  She's funny looking.  Oh,  she's hot,  dude.  She's funny looking,  man.  She milked 5 million golfer dollars.  She's a fucking sexy. 
[02:13:00]  Oh,  Rachel,  you can tell is sexy.  She's a little older.  I mean,  you know,  she's like 34,  35,  but oh.  When those eyes,  when those glasses come off,  I don't know.  I don't fucking,  I don't care if she fucking has a lazy eye and a patch.  These crazy Egyptians are now like the,  some of the president's supporters.  Yeah.  Are just riding through the crowd of protesters on horses and whipping people.  And like,  just,  it's like a battle from the 1800s.  Holy shit. 
[02:13:30]  Guys on a camel.  There's a guy on a camel.  The one guy going to work.  The rest of the world.  The one guy going to work.  Right.  I'm probably trading it for someone's daughter.  In a hat.  How the fuck are we supposed to relate to a guy on a camel with a whip?  Camel.  Yeah.  There's,  there's some violence going on now.  See,  instead of having the army or the police,  because they can't really do the dirty work.  Right.  He's got,  uh,  goons,  these protesters,  these,  uh,  pro Mubarak protesters,  which meanwhile are probably cops and military out of their uniforms, 
[02:14:00]  uh,  beating the fuck out of the protesters.  Yeah.  But the protesters are just going to fuck it.  It's hard to get guys off a horse,  but if you can pull that guy off a horse,  they'll just beat a couple of those guys to death.  Oh yeah.  I've seen Braveheart.  What were they doing?  I just watched that.  What were they doing to him before he,  what were they doing to him with that hook?  Take a look,  disemboweling him.  Oh,  they were?  Yeah.  They were cutting him,  his abdomen and pulling his intestines out.  Why don't they show that?  Or do they show that? 
[02:14:30]  I think they,  they,  they alluded to it when the midgets were playing,  you know,  how the midgets were doing the pregame show.  I don't remember.  Yeah.  The midgets were doing it and they were kind of acting out what was going to  happen to him.  And at one point,  they take a,  a fake blade and cut open one of the midgets.  And then he had rope in his shirt and he was pulling the rope out to show  that like,  they cut you open and rip your intestines out.  So it was kind of,  that was kind of the way.  If you say mercy,  what do they do?  Uh,  then they just chop your head off.  Oh,  they kill you.  They send a doctor in to show you up. 
[02:15:00]  Oh,  I didn't know what they were doing.  No,  they give you a,  they give you an instant death like that,  but they just,  he wouldn't,  you know,  give in.  But more importantly,  this is really breaking.  Like what the fuck's going on?  Could someone help us out?  Uh,  yeah,  they're,  they're,  they're,  it's getting ugly in a Cairo.  Now there's a clash.  And the military is basically saying they want an end to the protest calls for an end to  protest.  Who?  The military.  Egyptian military is calling for an end to the protest,  but it's getting ugly,  man.  But the video we just saw with the camel and the, 
[02:15:30]  and the guys on horses,  there,  uh,  there's no way they're going to stop at this point.  It's not going to just piss people off.  Well,  I think they have the most Iran.  This is a different situation.  This is weird though.  They have the maximum amount of people that they can get because there's been no real danger.  But now that you add an element of danger that you might get fucked up,  I think they're going to get some people that won't show up to these.  But they might get more people who show up angry.  You got to think,  I think most people that would show up have shown up.  Like when you go,  it's like a party.  You could just hang out, 
[02:16:00]  say,  fuck the president.  And,  uh,  no one's going to,  no one's going to fuck you up.  Uh,  but now you might get fucking,  you might get killed.  People like,  all right,  it's dangerous.  I don't want you going down there or don't go down there.  I don't want to go down there.  And then I don't know Anderson Cooper has gone to high ground.  You see that?  Oh,  he said,  fuck this.  I'll report.  I'll report from a roof.  Where is he actually there though?  Yeah,  he was on the ground.  Those guys aren't ballsy though.  Today he's on a roof.  Like fuck that.  Yeah.  There's cause there's some shit going on in the streets.  You know what?  You got to give those guys credit.  Like as much as we trash them, 
[02:16:30]  there are some balls on those dudes,  man.  Yeah.  They do go to some weird,  they go everywhere.  I would never be there.  Green screen it.  Who cares?  Yeah.  Say you there.  Just have me stand in front of like your fucking shot of the pyramid.  Hey,  something's happening here.  Oh,  you should see this.  Back to you over there.  Five feet from me.  And getting back to exit through the gift shop.  Banksy's was known for the West Bank stuff.  He did.  Yeah.  On the wall. 
[02:17:00]  Did you,  I think it was great.  Is that why they called him Banksy?  No,  they actually think they know who he is though.  I've seen a photo of who they think he is.  A very average guy named Robin something.  Gunningham.  You know this,  Danny?  You know a little bit about this?  Who's out?  They have a picture of him squatting in fucking Jamaica with a spray can.  They think that's him.  Danny was all over this shit like that.  You liked it,  Danny?  Two,  three months ago.  Yeah,  I loved it.  I saw it and I wasn't quite sure about it.  And like halfway through the movie,  I'm just like,  I just have a feeling if I stick with this, 
[02:17:30]  I'm going to like it.  And sure enough,  I loved it and I couldn't,  I still can't shut the fuck up about it.  What's your take on the movie?  I don't want to know.  I don't want to know.  What's your feeling?  It could go either way.  I don't want to ruin anything for anybody who hasn't seen it out there.  But,  you know.  I don't want to fucking see the movie already.  Yeah,  you should if you haven't.  I always think it's in the party and I saw it two or three weeks ago.  It could be.  It could be.  What could be fake about it though?  Well,  the way that,  you know,  Mr. Brainwash,  the way that he came to be and the way,  and some of his behaviors and, 
[02:18:00]  and some things just kind of hit you the wrong way.  And you go,  you know what?  I think that maybe Banksy created this guy.  I think maybe that Banksy,  like this is Banksy pulling the wool over everyone's eyes.  But then the more that you look at it,  you go,  you know what though?  Like this Mr. Brainwash,  like he really kind of is douchey.  Like who could really be that douchey?  And then you start looking into the film that he was trying to make  originally,  Life Remote Control.  And you start digging and digging and digging.  And like,  you know,  you go on YouTube,  you see that there was a trailer for Life Remote Control posted back in 2006.  And all of a sudden you go,  maybe this guy's fucking for real. 
[02:18:30]  So I just don't even want to know.  Cause I love all the speculation.  But he had no intention of ever making a film though,  by the way.  Yeah.  He just got obsessed with these guys.  Well,  if you're following the plot line of the movie,  then no,  he never really intended to make a street.  But he made everyone think he was actually making a documentary,  but he never made a documentary before.  So he was,  he was way,  way over his head.  Either way,  if Mr.  Brainwash is just a legit guy and everything in the film happened as it was,  you know,  as you're led to believe it was,  or if Banksy is just some super genius that actually made Mr.  Brainwash and conned the entire world at the thing. 
[02:19:00]  I would like to,  either way,  it's great.  Of course.  I would like to just fucking,  I would like to think he created Mr.  Brainwash.  If he did,  it's great.  It is,  you know,  it's fake.  They're in on it to get,  they,  they became friends.  And,  and then Banksy goes,  well,  I got a really good idea for you and,  and,  and myself.  Could be.  That's what I like to think happened.  And he knew this guy could pull it off.  Mr.  Brainwash.  It's not so much that I like to think one thing and someone else likes to think  another thing.  I just like that people talk about it this much or,  or it could just be exactly.  That's a good movie. 
[02:19:30]  No one's,  no one's walking out of,  you know,  out of the next Adam Sandler piece of shit going,  yeah,  what do you think about that?  Two months later,  we're not still talking about it,  but this film two months later,  still Adam Sandler will be on the show in a couple of weeks.  Oh,  sorry,  Adam.  Is he coming on?  Yeah.  What,  what day?  I'm not really sure yet.  Well,  to promote his latest.  Oh boy.  He's hard to get.  He doesn't do a lot of radio.  We had him on once.  Did you?  On the phone or in person?  On the phone.  I've never met him. 
[02:20:00]  We had him on the phone.  He was on the phone.  He called up on the telephone.  I'm going to call you up on the telephone.  Is that Adam?  It's just whatever it is.  I don't know what it is.  I don't get that.  It's one less interview.  Fuck it.  Let's blow it up.  Let's blow it up right now.  We're not starstruck anymore.  Fuck it.  I am.  Fuck it.  That means you don't have a picture with Adam Sandler.  Oh,  nice.  That's what that means.  Look at these clashes.  They're great,  man.  Now this is action packed. 
[02:20:30]  That good enough for those in the streets.  So far,  not yet.  Whipping demonstrators.  Oh,  the horse just fell down.  It's hard for us to say how many are in the streets.  Is it 10,000?  Is it more than that?  Those guys are going to be killed for whipping demonstrators.  Those numbers are not clear.  We have Dominic Di Natale live in Cairo report coming up in a matter of moments as he and  Greg Palkot have taken us, rather, throughout the morning.  Yeah,  and you know,  the remarkable thing about this is that we saw a fairly peaceful relationship yesterday  between the army and the protesters. 
[02:21:00]  They were allowing the people to be out there in protest, but now you have this pro-Mubarak  faction that is coming out.  There's also been some things on our wires about perhaps they're working for the security  forces themselves.  It looks like Sheiknik.  So that's where he's trying to be.  That seat is clashing in the street, and it makes you wonder.  Jose Mubarak is in a tough position right now.  He said,  guess what?  I'm not going to run again.  It looks like it would have been pretty difficult for him to be reelected in this environment.  Not only...  Wow,  it's getting all good.  Looks like Egypt stock.  I don't want that,  Chip.  Egypt stock. 
[02:21:30]  Let me go to Sean in North Carolina.  Sean.  Hey, boys.  How are you?  Hello.  You got something on Exit Through the gift shop.  I don't know if you guys have said this yet,  but don't you just think that the guy is Banksy?  I thought of that, too.  I absolutely thought of that, as well.  I thought of that, too, the French guy, but no, because...  I like to think Banksy's cooler than that.  I think he's British, and this guy's French.  But when he finally stepped up to make his art, it looked so much like Banksy stuff.  And also the fact that, okay, if this guy's a documentary filmmaker or wanted to be one, 
[02:22:00]  has a family, you'd think he was that gifted of an artist and just never tried it, and all  of a sudden it was like...  Did you see how the art got made, dude?  He wasn't a gifted artist.  He was having other people copy Banksy's style and just kind of selling it.  Like he did something.  He was having shit printed out, and he was just going, do this and do that, and then  they were doing it.  He wasn't doing it.  Yeah, but he was doing a lot of the cutting.  All right, you know.  No, he didn't.  You never see him on film creating any of his own work.  Yeah, but my... 
[02:22:30]  Jimmy's absolutely right, but then I think maybe Banksy actually did make pieces that's  not in the film that fucking...  For him to make it look like Banksy work.  Right.  To sell it.  Right.  So I don't know.  I don't know.  I'd like to see Robert Gunningham's tax returns from this coming year.  Oh, look at that.  Because I bet you he made a fuckload of money in the United States.  I bet you he doesn't claim them.  It's probably to a corporation.  It's probably to a dummy corporation, as we call it.  I don't know how smart people do that.  Oh, yeah, and Jimmy.  Go ahead.  Kenny Incorporated.  Kenny Incorporated.  Yes, sir. 
[02:23:00]  Got me.  Did he get you?  Yes.  Oh, yeah, he did.  Legit.  Legit.  Damn.  Who's Ripples?  Ripples in the Arab world.  Why is he over there?  Yemen leader won't seek re-election.  Travis, what's up?  Ripples.  We don't whisper on this show.  Why are you whispering?  We share.  Yeah, we share.  What's up, Travis?  Even if it's mundane, which makes it even better.  What do you mean, even if, when it's?  You were just whispering to Danny.  What was it about?  I was walking down the hallway, and then I walked in, and everybody looked at me, so I  asked Danny if everyone was laughing at me. 
[02:23:30]  That's not what the fuck we are.  Who are you, fucking Carrie's mother?  That's not important to say anything.  I laughed at you.  That's hilarious.  Because I walk down the hall.  You can't hear the show as you're walking down the hall.  You know, Anthony looks, and then Jim looks as I walk in.  I'm like, and then we all start laughing and laughing.  Oh, the paranoia around here.  It runs rampant.  Hey, the Staten Island, what is it down there?  Groundhog.  Groundhog, yeah.  Staten Island Chuck or something, right?  We got some audio on the Staten Island Chuck.  Oh, great.  Here's that moment at the Staten Island Zoo this morning. 
[02:24:00]  Chuck, here he is.  Look at this.  He's eating right away.  So, Staten Island Chuck does not see his shadow, and it was a groundhog consensus this year.  Punxsutawney Phil came out a little earlier this morning and did not see his shadow either with many cheers. 
[02:24:30]  I fucking hate that.  Wow, what a non-moment that just was.  I don't blame the guy.  Fucking Punxsutawney Phil is fucking.  By the way, worst hairdo ever on fucking TV right now.  Oh, God.  What is that fucking rotten little?  Terrible woman.  Oh, more.  That's live from Cairo.  Look, they're throwing rocks.  Of course they are.  I love their rock throwing.  There's some fucking, there's trucks making a blockade, and there's people throwing rocks. 
[02:25:00]  Some guy's got a cardboard shield.  They're LARPing in Egypt.  They're LARPing.  Don't the people kind of need the military to help them out on this one, Ant?  Like, how do you, like, overthrow this guy without the military's help?  But who are the people you're fucking going after?  Well, the military, who said they have a vested interest in this guy?  My prediction, he ends up lasting, because there's no guy ready to step in.  Yeah, and now there's pro-government forces throwing a monkey wrench into this whole thing. 
[02:25:30]  And they can't fucking decide on an opposition leader?  Right.  I don't want the Muslim Brotherhood.  No, even though it would be exciting.  These people not hear about Staten Island, Chuck?  Yeah.  That was such a non-30-second.  I mean, the Egypt people.  Yeah, the Egypt people.  Yeah.  That's good.  How old are you?  The Egypt, are the Egypt people okay?  They're Egyptians, you blithering ninny.  The Egypt people.  Oh, ninny.  Yes.  I can't, you know, until the test comes back. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, when does that happen?  When do we get your fucking DNA results and find out what race you are?  Is that soon?  I don't know.  It was sent.  Soon, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Nervous.  Are you nervous a little bit?  I don't care.  You don't care?  What if it does come back and proves that you do have some African-American blood in your background?  I will be interested in tracing some genealogy a bit more closely to find out.  He was born a slave, but he died a businessman.  What is that? 
[02:26:30]  Like an Ancestry.com commercial.  I wanted to look up my ancestry, but I kind of knew what was going to come up.  A black guy?  Sure.  And he goes, so I looked it up and found out my great-great-grandfather was born a slave, but he died a businessman.  And he's all proud.  He's holding a picture of his grandpa.  Well, he said businessman, businessman.  I don't know.  Probably business.  I don't know.  Something he's figured out.  No, he says something like that.  I hate the Ancestry.com commercials because the one guy is like all psyched that his great-great-grandparents lived next door to the Wright brothers. 
[02:27:00]  And at the end, he's holding a picture of the Wright brothers with the Wright flyer.  And it's like, you were just their annoying neighbor.  Probably a nosy, what are you building?  Hey, what are you building?  Orville, what are you building?  Yeah.  Just annoying neighbor guy.  Are there going to be movies on those things?  How much for my lagage?  They had an accent.  I'm not going to fly in that. 
[02:27:30]  What is it?  Yeah, what are you guys like, the wrong brothers?  He was probably the guy that said, if man were meant to fly, he'd have wings.  Just the grouchy neighbor guy.  They got that engine running at all hours.  If it was for his dumb great-great-grandfather, if he had it his way, we'd still be fucking covered wagoning it across the country.  Why don't you build a bell that alerts you when there's a Negro in town?  That's what he did. 
[02:28:00]  He just went off once in a while, always outside his wife's bedroom.  I tried Ancestry.com.  You did?  Yeah, I went on there.  Go see those little leafs come up and you click on it.  But then there's too many different options.  Like, I don't fucking know.  I'm only able to trace back, like, fucking, meh.  Like, up to my grandparents' parents, you know, kind of a thing.  And only one of them.  That's a photo album.  I know!  That's just it.  Anything else to do that is some fucking, you know, looking like Michael Corleone is going to drag him into a courtroom so his brother doesn't testify. 
[02:28:30]  Well, don't they have to do it?  Like, after you give a couple of information, it's like, yeah, this is me.  Do it?  No, they don't have to.  It's almost like a, it's almost like internet.  It's almost like an internet of Ancestry.  What happens is you, uh, you gotta get a guy, though, that sorts through all that shit and realizes the zeros that were in your family tree that don't mean shit and get the ones with the stories.  But here's what you gotta do.  You gotta put in as much info as you can get and then somebody else that might be related to you that might have used Ancestry, that's where you get the leaf from. 
[02:29:00]  It links up to theirs and constantly, like, starts connecting family members with other family members that knew some shit.  So I might have a cousin in California that went on Ancestry.  Right, but you're, but you're doing it all yourself.  You should really get a guy that could just sort through that.  I don't care that much.  I just figured, let me see how far I could go.  Like that, that TV show, what is it called?  And Brooke Shields was on it.  Yeah, it was, uh.  Where You're From?  Where You're From.  Yeah.  Where did I, yeah, but I don't care.  Yeah, but they, like, I'm just gonna, eh. 
[02:29:30]  They get, they get one guy to do all what you're doing to, to find the, the, the people in your family tree that have a real story.  And then they blow off all the other crap.  Sarah Jessica Parker, Parker did it.  Oh, likely.  Secretariat in her background.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, you stupid horse.  Oh.  Yes, you're related to a triple crown winner.  Yeah.  They wonder why she runs around the living room whenever there's a Budweiser commercial played.  She cries at the wrong part of The Godfather. 
[02:30:00]  Ah, Dune.  Right.  Yeah, so, uh, I, I found, I found, like, uh, some old, um, census shit from, like, the early 19, 1903 and shit like that.  And it had, like, my grandmother's parents and their census.  That's pretty cool.  And it had her, her in there.  So, I kind of started clicking on shit and adding some shit.  And I haven't checked in a while.  Maybe some, some new stuff is up there.  Some new shit is up there, so.  All right.  I gotta plug, my band is gonna be playing soon. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, what's your band, Chip?  We're getting back together.  Oh, cool.  Burning Embers.  Burning Embers.  Yeah.  Who are these guys from school?  Yeah, some guys I used to play with.  Burning Embers.  Ew.  Great name.  Yeah.  CD's coming soon.  Oh, you're gonna CD out?  Yeah.  It's a big reunion.  Yeah.  What do you do in the band?  Sing.  Oh, you're a singer?  Yeah.  What kind of music?  Just whatever, everything. 
[02:31:00]  Comments, originals.  What genre?  What's that?  It depends on what's available.  No, I mean, like, what type of, is it rock?  It's everything.  Country?  Yeah, everything.  We're very popular.  It doesn't sound like people would want to see, like, a bunch of different types of music.  I wouldn't go.  We're very good.  Like, if I like rock and I gotta sit through some country, I'm not gonna want to see you guys.  I wouldn't buy the CD, for sure.  Burning Ember.  Yeah, well, it's a bestseller.  Is it a bestseller?  You haven't put it out yet.  I have. 
[02:31:30]  See, I'm lying, Jim.  Jim's a liar.  Hey, um.  He just tells you what he thinks he wants.  Fucking liar.  Steven Singer's here, guys.  We gotta take a break.  He's got gifts.  He's got gifts.  Oh, my God.  Secret.  Don't fucking ruin it, because I don't want to know what the gift is.  Secret surprise gifts.  Oh, my God.  I know.  It's gonna be a rose.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  It's gonna be a rose.  How great it would be if Steven's gift was an announcement about his health? 
[02:32:00]  Oh.  Yeah.  I saw him in the hallway.  He's a very nice man.  He is a good guy.  All right.  We'll break.  I would say he's a good guy.  He's a nice man.  He drove all the way from Philly?  Yeah.  He drove at 4 o'clock in the morning.  All right.  He's a pretty assistant here.  Oh, yeah.  We'll give him 10 minutes.  No, you can give him...  Oh, my God.  If he drove from Philly, we'll give him a solid 10 minutes.  From the ice storm.  From the other corner of 8th and Walnut?  Yeah.  All the way to here in an ice storm.  We'll give him 12 minutes.  That's fair.  You could do more than that, I feel. 
[02:32:30]  He rode up on a camel with a whip.  Just whipping his assistant all the way up.  With a gold-covered rose.  Yeah.  That's what he does.  That's perfect.  I want to take a gold-covered rose, and I want someone to put it in my ass like in Caligula.  Do you remember after Malcolm used his...  I mean, that's probably not the intention of the gold rose.  Probably not, but...  That was one of my favorite things.  He puts it in the lard on top of Proculus's hiney.  Yes.  Yes.  Very embarrassing for the married couple.  Big fist full of lard.  Yay. 
[02:33:00]  It's great.  All right.  Yes, Steven Singer coming in, I guess...  Yes, we do.  ...after a few words.  Boy, this should be really exciting.  Yeah, he's great.  He's got a story to tell.  I'm sure.  He had to drive through the ice storm.  He's selling all kinds of crazy jewelry.  Oh, yeah.  Making money.  Come on.  Making it rain.  Why couldn't he be the guy they just found in that car overnight?  Oh, no.  The guy who shot himself, you mean.  I didn't say that, Sam.  This is Steven.  You're saying that.  I mean, that's the guy that...  He's a legend in Philly and all over the country. 
[02:33:30]  Maybe I was talking about it.  Maybe it was a gas thing.  The jewelry world.  Where he ran out of gas and had to be in a car all night.  But even so, why would you want him to run out of gas?  I don't understand.  He's a legend in Philly.  So he's a Mumia Abu-Jamal.  Sad part is Steven Singer has hated more.  Oh, this fucking guy will be in next.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony show on the virus.  Sirius XM.  The government and parents everywhere.  They tried to ban it. 
[02:34:00]  This is the virus on Sirius XM.  In honor of Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony show proudly takes a look at some  of the most inspiring and intellectually stimulating African-Americans on Twitter.  Today's tweet comes from SlimeNasty with an E.  I'm scared.  Who writes?  Why are these niggas so loud at 1030 in the morning?  Take y'all asses to sleep.  Guess I'm woke for now.  Well said. 
[02:34:30]  SlimeNasty.  Stay tuned all month as we continue to celebrate the advancements of the African-American culture  here on the Opie and Anthony show.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:35:00]  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Picture.  Yeah.  Let's bring in Steven Singer.  Steven. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, my God, this music's fucking blasting.  That's all right.  Oh, turn it down, for God's sake.  What are you doing, you kids?  You're so loud.  We've got to step out of character for one second, and then we're going to beat the shit out of him.  He is our biggest sponsor.  Steven Singer rules.  And the Opie Anthony Show greatly appreciates that.  Wow.  This whole thing.  Listen, don't be nice to me.  I don't like it.  No, I love the fact that you advertise on our program, and you have wonderful jewelry,  and you look like Jack Tripper's neighbor. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, my God.  And hopefully you wind up like Jack Tripper.  Yes.  That's very nice of you to say.  Thanks for the kind words.  Can we see a picture of Jack Tripper's neighbor?  Because you're so right, man.  Oh, shit.  Larry.  Larry.  Larry.  It's bad enough I've got armpit hair on my head.  Now I've got to have that?  Larry Klein.  You've heard that before, though, right?  No, that's the first.  No?  Did you use conditioner, or you said, fuck it?  I said, you know what?  I've got to use so much glue to make my hair look like something's going on there.  It's just very puby.  Exactly.  This stuff is called kryptonite. 
[02:36:30]  It's green like moose.  I don't know what the hell happens.  It freezes it.  Just keep it calm?  Yeah, it's just a mess without it.  I've got hair going on my ears, my hands.  That's the 1975 version, too.  I'm talking like from the day.  Have you heard that one before?  No, honestly, I've never heard that.  Oh, wow.  We've got to roll with that.  That's pretty good.  He's not gay, is he?  Why are you?  It looks it compared to that.  Yeah, you know.  That's what it's going to look like. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, man.  There's your future.  Richard Klein.  Right, right, right.  Richard Klein.  Larry on Three's Company.  Larry on Three's Company.  That's what Steve Singer kind of looks like.  Larry in the world.  That's very good.  Now you're going to have to post my picture with his picture and do an AB.  Oh, exactly.  We can do that.  Yeah.  It's going to be great.  Yes, I'll Photoshop you into the set.  Well, Norton did a spot for us on your channel.  And he said, oh, Steven Singer's got a great surprise for you this year.  He said, and what is it?  He's a tranny.  And I get like hundreds and hundreds of calls. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, we want to talk to the tranny.  And they want to order like a rose or jewelry.  At least you know the advertising's working.  They asked for me.  Are you mad at me?  No, I love it.  It's great.  We want to talk to the tranny.  It's great.  As long as they're calling.  Yes.  That was actually just me over and over hoping.  So I don't even have to ask, like, where did you hear about it?  Well, they always say have fun with the reeds.  Yes, we do.  That's the thing I like the most about Steven Singer advertising because it's, oh, we could  do whatever the hell we want with the reed.  And we don't get yelled at. 
[02:38:00]  I listen.  Make a little fun.  Why would I want to change?  You guys are great.  Have a little fun with it, right?  That's the whole thing is you're listening to have fun.  Why would I want to change?  You can't bash the product because it's amazing anyway.  So I dare you to even try.  Meanwhile, we have you to bash.  Right.  I'm an a-hole.  So just pick on me.  What's the difference?  Standing on some corner of Ethan Walnut, just standing there waiting for people to come  up to him.  Exactly.  Well, it's like people who are going to buy something because they listen to this show.  They know the tone.  They know what we're like anyway.  So it's not like all of a sudden you put a nice guy voice and they're like, oh, I should  be serious. 
[02:38:30]  They know we're being sincere when we're not.  Steven, Valentine's Day.  It's got to be a busy time for you, right?  Very busy.  Very busy.  Yeah.  Thanks.  And not in large part to you guys.  That means we don't have to talk about it.  That's good.  Thank God.  The gold covered roads, they sell fast, right?  They sell great.  As a matter of fact, we are so stupid that every year what we do is we put a new color  on so people have something else to buy because they build like a bouquet.  The bouquet.  Right.  So this year we started blue.  Then we called it, my beautiful assistant, Leanne, named it the Royal Sapphire Blue or Princess 
[02:39:00]  Sapphire or some kind of crap she named it.  Oh, you come up with that?  Is that what we call it?  We like it.  Yes.  And so, you know, with that stupid princess that got engaged and the princess dies, new  future daughter-in-law, ex-dead, whatever she is.  Oh, wait.  And whatever her name is.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Middleton.  Yes.  Kate Middleton.  Kate Middleton.  Whatever.  Right.  So it's sold out in like eight minutes.  Look at it.  I see we're on the website.  There you go.  Sold out.  Sold out.  Oh, wow.  So make more.  We can.  It takes like 12 months to make these things. 
[02:39:30]  It does.  We start making them.  It takes us a year to build the inventory.  It's like Jerry Lewis's telethon.  The day after the telethon, Jerry gets right to work.  Right back to the year.  You'd think we would be a little bit smarter after doing this for 15 years, but every year  we screw something up.  Does it really take that long to make them?  Yeah.  It takes us.  We can only make a few thousand a week.  And it takes a whole year to build the inventory.  You sell that many?  Wow.  Jesus.  Yes, we do.  Yes, we do.  Are they actually roses?  It's a real rose.  If you want, you can.  I think we did it last year.  Didn't you break one in half last year?  No.  You stopped wanting to break it in half.  It's a real rose dipped in 24 karat gold. 
[02:40:00]  They're too valuable to break in half.  And then the leaves are enameled and they're all different colors and people collect them.  I never figured out how you do that.  Like, isn't the gold isn't hot?  They, at first they put it in brass.  They dip it in brass, which the brass is hot too, but everything is different melting temperatures.  And they do, it's like frozen ice cream.  You know when they have that ice cream that's hot on the outside and cold on the inside type of thing?  They do it real quick?  That's what happened with the rose?  It's kind of like that.  That's the simple way.  I want some ice cream. 
[02:40:30]  Yes.  Now I want ice cream.  Right.  But anyway, so we take the stupid roses.  But they last forever and they look very, very nice.  Yeah, people love them.  And people collect them.  And the blue is sold out.  Blue is sold out.  We have most of the other colors.  You better have some blues for us today.  Actually, we put a couple aside for you and we do have some in the grab bag.  And then you can put it on eBay and people get bidding working.  Your assistant is distractingly attractive.  Well.  Like, I can't fucking think of anything else.  All I can tell you is this.  I'm just, like, I keep looking over like, all right, I'll start.  Well, I can't see her because she's strategically sat right behind me. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, which is the most dangerous place to sit when it comes to Jimmy.  Exactly.  She's in the Rocco Lampone seat.  Is that what his name was?  Rocco.  Oh, wait.  So, anyway, last time I was here, I think it was, like, the Cherry Darts or some exciting  contest we had.  Yes, we were doing the Cherry Darts.  And she was somewhere else.  She was traveling.  And I walked in.  Opie said, what the F are you doing here without her?  Get out of here.  He said, don't even ever come again without her.  So, we're smart.  We were actually excited that you were here because of that. 
[02:41:30]  Exactly.  Had nothing to do with Steven Singer.  You could just stay back in Philly.  This is true.  Send your lovely assistant.  You should change your name and you're thinking, my assistant is gorgeous.com.  And guess what?  The people that come into the store, we got 51 people that work in the store.  35 are women.  And they're all knockouts.  Really?  Yes.  She's the ugliest one.  I see.  She's the ugliest one.  I see.  Now, actually, working with Steven Singer Jewelers.  That is really nice. 
[02:42:00]  She would have a ring on her finger.  She's involved with somebody, but hasn't made the full commitment yet.  What kind of cheap bastard you're involved with if you can't get any jewelry?  I don't see a necklace.  I don't see nothing.  Yeah, there's no jewelry on your assistant, Steven Singer.  Look at the rose and pass it down.  Get her some jewelry here.  It's not you.  It's that slouch boyfriend of hers.  I'm trying to cock-block him.  Yeah, exactly.  What, is he queer?  Yes.  Wow, there it is.  I'm holding one right now.  Look at that.  These are nice and heavy. 
[02:42:30]  That is wonderful.  You outdid yourself this year, Steven.  Yes.  They look a little different than last year.  It's the same crap.  I mean, they're beautiful.  Now, if you remember, last year we left a big bowl full in the middle of the console here,  and every day someone would steal one, thinking that they were getting away with it.  Not only that, you had, in either the same day or the next day, I don't remember, you had Ozzy in.  And you guys were taking pictures and tweeting them and stuff like that.  And there was a picture with Ozzy and the rose, and Norton tweeted out, and they were all over the place. 
[02:43:00]  And we got, like, a bazillion hits.  Yes, it was very nice.  It's in a video called Ozzy's.  I was hoping we could put one in J-Lo's ass when she walks by.  That would be good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, bang.  Bang.  Is this a rose?  They're all real roses, and they're just all different colors, enameling on it.  And that one's platinum dipped, and that's gold dipped.  I wish I had hair, because I would put these in my hair, and I would just look pretty.  Sometimes I think of those things.  I like the red one.  Of the three, I think I prefer the red one.  Well, I'm taking the red one with me. 
[02:43:30]  Well, we brought a selection, so you guys, everybody can have whatever they like, and  we will hook you up.  They're very lovely.  They are nice.  Many different colors this year.  And we make it very, very easy.  Orange.  You know, my shameless plug.  Purple.  People call us, they put their own little love note on there.  It comes in a beautiful gift box, beautiful package.  Of course it does.  And they don't have to do a freaking thing.  It's free shipping.  Yeah.  And it's terrific.  Free shipping in the United States.  In the United States.  Canada can go fuck off, is what Steven Singer says. 
[02:44:00]  Canada is a mess.  We have to do all kinds of jump through circles like that.  Not as messy as Egypt.  Oh, yeah.  What do you got?  How do you do commerce with them?  It costs like $150 to ship a rose to Canada because of the import duty.  And then they...  Really?  Really?  It's a mess.  What's wrong with them?  They don't want our business.  It's a mess.  And then they send you money with hockey players on it?  What is that about?  And you guys have a lot of Canadian listeners, I'll tell you that.  Oh, we know.  We don't acknowledge them, though.  No.  It's annoying that they won't...  They're so hard.  Do we have a NAFTA? 
[02:44:30]  Doesn't that cover that?  I don't know.  I don't know what it is.  It's very, very tough.  Can I give away some stuff?  You absolutely can.  Oh, yeah.  We can give out five?  You can give out as many as you want.  You tell them.  As long as it's not blue, you can give out as many as you want.  That's what I'm going to do.  Listen up really fast.  Steven Singer's got five $250 gift cards for Valentine's Day.  Holy shit.  That's cool, man.  Steven Singer Jewelers, visit IHateStevenSinger.com today.  Must be at least 18 years old and a listener or subscriber.  Well, they're listening right now, so they better be hijacking it, though.  Not open to residents of Alaska, Hawaii, or that dreaded Canada. 
[02:45:00]  So call now.  We'll take five random callers for the Steven Singer $250 gift cards.  Can't they do something to get it?  Like maybe Stump Steven?  Sure.  You want to play Stump Steven?  I would love to play Stump Steven.  What's your expertise?  How about anything they ask him that he can't answer, they get a rose.  So it could just be the first five callers.  Listen, I'm not that bright.  Are you an expert at something?  No.  Absolutely not.  You know anything about Egypt?  Jewelry.  And how that's going to affect Israel.  I'm a complete idiot. 
[02:45:30]  That's why I'm in the jewelry business.  He knows about jewelry.  Listen, circus clowns, radio, jewelers.  It's all in the same thing here.  It's nice.  We're in between.  There's not much going on here.  Yeah.  You don't know anything?  What do you do when you're not making gold-dipped roses?  Well, that's a good question.  What do you do?  What's your hobbies?  I drive my â€“ I have a motorcycle.  I got a Porsche I race.  I used to play the drums and be in a band, but now I'm like old and feeble.  I can still play drums.  Really, all I do is work.  I'm boring. 
[02:46:00]  That's it?  Yeah, yeah.  This is pretty much it.  Is that true?  Yeah.  All it is is work.  Yeah.  Listen, I said to her, let's go up.  I said to my beautiful assistant, Leanne, let's go up yesterday and stay over.  You know what I mean?  So we'll be here.  We'll all be â€“ you know, maybe she goes, nah, just pick me up in the morning.  No.  We know a lot about Steven Singer.  I don't want to be with you an extra minute.  You're boring.  Just get up at 3 in the morning and pick me up.  You were trying to work it with your assistant.  God bless you.  I bet her boyfriend was putting a kibosh on that.  Yeah, yeah.  Does Steven try to get a little frisky?  Gets a few in him? 
[02:46:30]  No.  I told you I'm boring.  What's your poison?  You drink anything?  I drink a little vodka, a little Belvedere and grapefruit.  Yeah, yeah.  You like that?  That's my thing.  Are we going to have a drinking party?  It would be nice.  We've got to think of a good contest.  We've got to do something good.  And by the way, listen, let's give out some roses from now until Valentine's Day.  Hook these people up, man.  Let's â€“ why don't we go to the phones?  Yes.  So what are we playing?  Stump Steven Singer?  Go ahead.  Why not?  Is it okay we do this?  This should be hard.  Or do rules need to be written?  No, it wasn't approved.  It wasn't approved. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, we're doing an unapproved contest.  Oh, that'll be trouble.  Uh-oh.  But you spent so much money with this company.  Trust me.  They'll look the other way.  I hope they don't take my Super Bowl tickets away.  They gave me and Leanne Freed passes to the Super Bowl this week.  You guys didn't get that?  No, we didn't get that.  No?  No.  Yeah, Bill called me up personally.  He said, listen, yeah, you want to take â€“ he said, you want to take four?  You know, I got it for you and Leanne.  You guys want to bring two other people?  We're not even permitted to watch it.  Really?  Yes.  I can't even watch it.  I believe him.  Yeah, well, we broadcast on the NFL channel, so, you know. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, see?  Yeah, listen, we're there.  Are you really good?  No.  I wouldn't have doubted it, Bill.  You know how to get us going.  Let's go to Bobby in New York.  Bobby, we're playing Stump IHateStevenSinger.com, I guess.  Hey there, Bobby.  Plug in there.  Yeah.  Okay.  He's a Philly guy, so â€“  Philly.  Big hockey town.  Nice.  Yeah.  Name the two captains of this year's All-Star game.  I couldn't tell you.  In the NHL.  I couldn't tell you.  I said congratulations to this man.  I couldn't tell you who the captain was when the Flyers won both Stanley Cups. 
[02:48:00]  It was Bobby Clark.  That's cool.  I can name Tennille's partner the captain.  That's not what he asked.  I guess you win.  I drink Captain Morgan.  Yeah, exactly.  Congratulations.  Hope he's a big hockey fan.  Hope he's going to answer for me.  You know what?  I did not watch this year.  I have no fucking idea.  I actually know who it is.  I'm not going to â€“ I don't give it away.  What's the answer there, Bobby?  Vigora and Bertelry.  Very good.  There you go.  Hey, you win a Steven Singer $250 gift card, Bobby.  Hold on the line, okay? 
[02:48:30]  Thank you.  Ihatestevensinger.com.  Make sure I put them on hold.  Ah-ha.  Look what Canadians can't get.  Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha.  Pretty gold-dipped roses.  I thought you were pointing at good surgeries.  Sorry, Canada.  Medical care, yeah.  That would have been a funnier way to say it, of course.  Ah, that is good.  Let's go to Gio in Jersey playing stump.  Ihatestevensinger.com.  How are you doing, guys?  Hi.  Okay.  1993, Devils win the Stanley Cup Game 4 against Detroit. 
[02:49:00]  Somebody openly wept.  One of the players openly wept right on the bench, and it was broadcast, like, all over  the world.  Who was it?  Hmm.  Can I phone a friend?  You don't have any.  Yes, exactly.  Under contacts, nothing comes up but then over the Apple store.  Well, on the rules of this contest, I think you win.  All right.  What's the answer?  Another winner.  What is the answer, sir?  Number eight, Mike Luso.  All right.  Okay, I thought so. 
[02:49:30]  I didn't know the answer, even if you told me the answer.  Let's move away from hockey questions.  But, Gio, you got a $250 gift certificate from I Hate Steven Singer.  Let me go to Rick in Texas.  A lot of snow in Texas.  Super Bowl in Texas.  What part of Texas?  El Paso.  We got three inches last night and it's still snowing.  Wow, that's crazy.  We got three inches the last hour.  Exactly.  I've had three inches my whole life.  You packing, Steven?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:50:00]  Packing what?  Nothing.  No, he's not.  He's a gold-dipped penis.  But you know how much better I look than I get with jewelry?  I look a lot better.  You're like a four, but if you're in your store, you're a nine and a half.  Good one, Jim.  Rick in Texas, you want to stump Steven Singer?  Yeah, okay.  I'll get off hockey because I know nothing about it.  I live in the desert.  What gun does Anthony love to sing karaoke with at four o'clock in the morning?  Any whole?  Could be three.  Yeah, it's three.  Yeah. 
[02:50:30]  I know he loves weapons, but I don't know the actual gun.  Yeah.  Well, the one I enjoy the most is 50 caliber.  Yes, that is true.  That is my favorite.  Cool.  Yeah.  Well, it looks like we got another winner.  Another winner!  Yes.  It is the first five calls, isn't it?  We did this for going on to the quickly.  Well, it's like a slam dunk.  Yeah.  Boy, 10 o'clock couldn't come sooner.  Thank you, Rick.  Someone on Twitter.  Wow.  Great guest.  The guy who owns a jewelry store.  Who's next?  The boo from the 7-Eleven around the corner? 
[02:51:00]  Bagger Steve on Twitter is killing you.  Better bad person.  All right, let's go to Staten Island.  But it's Steven Singer.  It's different.  He's like a celebrity.  Who did you say we're not allowed to make fun of this morning?  Asians?  Yeah.  Am I allowed to make fun of them since I don't own the show?  Yes.  I can say whatever I want?  Oh, cool.  All right.  You can make fun of whoever you want.  They don't spend money on jewelry?  Asians are the worst.  Really?  Well, Jews are the worst customers.  That's the absolute worst.  Really?  And then Asians are second.  They're like engineers.  Are you a Jew?  Yes.  I hate the Jews.  I'm a self-hating Jew.  I'm a self-hating Jew. 
[02:51:30]  You hate them because they're not good for your business.  We have things like the non-smoking thing.  We have a Jew with a line through it in the front of the store.  Jesus Christ!  No, it's not big enough.  It's too big.  Really?  Take me to Florida.  God, have I heard that a lot.  There's always a problem.  Oh, it's so many whining.  This is way better than giving away gift cards.  Are you kidding me?  I always say if my wife was my first customer, I'd shoot myself.  I'd kill myself.  It's terrible.  Really?  They're like nice Gentiles. 
[02:52:00]  Gentiles are good.  Middle-class Gentiles.  That comes in nice.  Don't bother me.  Thank you.  Appreciate it.  Can't do enough of that.  How was Sam Roberts?  Sam was very nervous when he came in.  Was he?  Like a little chihuahua shaking with his eyes all leaky.  Listen, but how about how cute his girlfriend is?  She's fantastic.  Or fiance, I should say.  Now, she's dynamite, right?  I honestly can say everybody in this, that has to do with this show, is way out of their league.  Like, every girl. 
[02:52:30]  Absolutely.  Way out of everybody's league.  Absolutely.  And Sam is right there.  No, she's...  Like, you don't deserve Jess.  No, I don't think so.  You don't deserve a girl that's that pretty.  She's cute, and she's sweet, and she's just nice, personable.  We all...  There's no way, like, Jimmy, there's no way that girl should be with you.  Opie, stop it.  It's like, E-Rock, I'm not even gonna fucking go there.  That's just crazy.  E-Rock came in, he'd get his wedding bands and stuff. 
[02:53:00]  They said, are you sure?  You're with him, really?  Do you make a wedding band in Elastic?  And, like, they kept asking, like, this is for real?  Yeah, this is it?  Yeah.  Wow.  It's, uh...  Yeah, now, all you guys traded up somehow.  I don't know what it is.  Just way out.  It's just the radio show and fucking being famous and maybe having a dime.  But I'll never be in for anything wedding-related.  No.  No.  Ever.  No.  No.  Unless I get a gold, like, cock ring, that I would use. 
[02:53:30]  You should make those.  You know what's funny?  I'm like a crack dealer.  This is what happens.  They come in, or they get something, and then they just come in.  Let's just go check it out, you know?  Something else.  And then before you know, one thing leads to another, and bam!  You got it.  How long was E-Rock on the hook there?  It was like three, four years ago, stringing her along.  Yeah, yeah.  And brought her in once.  Bam!  Done.  That was it.  It's like six months later, they're married.  Right?  How long was he on the hook?  Yeah.  Yeah.  For a while, dodging the ball.  Greenpeace came over.  Yeah.  That's why people hate things.  On the hook. 
[02:54:00]  Let's go to Missouri.  We're giving out the Steven Singer $250 gift cards.  Nick, what do you got, buddy?  We're trying to stump Steven.  How you doing, guys?  First of all, I want to say thank you to Mr. Singer.  For last year, I bought my wife black and white diamond earrings from him, and she loves  them.  She wears them all the time.  Oh, thank you.  It's very nice of you.  Now for my question.  Mr. Singer, can you please answer where I met my wife?  Where you met your wife? 
[02:54:30]  That's a tough one.  Let's see.  I would say, where part of the country are you from?  Well, I'm from New Jersey.  She's from Wisconsin.  You met her down the shore, one of the casinos.  Can I guess, too, if that's wrong?  Where is it going?  Yeah.  Get it, Jimmy.  She's a lot lizard, and you gave her $40 to snake her tongue into your buttocks after  a long truck ride.  Is that like a tunnel bunny?  That's close, Jimmy, but I met her at a Kmart in Spearfish, South Dakota. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, man.  I was close.  Oh, you win.  Yeah, you won a gift card.  Hold on line there, Nick.  Thank you.  How amazing would it be if Steven Singer got that?  It was great, Karnak.  Let's go with a girl for the last one, possibly.  Nice.  Chris in Utah.  Chris?  Hey.  Hiya.  Hey.  How's it going?  Hello.  What's going on?  It's fucking cold here.  Yes, it is.  Are you in the D?  Oh, Utah.  Oh.  I'm in Utah.  For you.  And it's like freaking 11 below here. 
[02:55:30]  It's so damn cold.  Yeah.  Oh.  So cold all over the country.  No, exactly.  It's called winter.  Look into it.  Yeah, come on in for the big win.  I gotcha.  What's that?  I'm kind of sick choke.  Yeah, sorry.  Get your head and your ass wired together, or I'll take a giant shit on you.  All right.  Sorry, madam.  I'm going to have to pass on that.  So my question is, do you know who the Steel's leader is this year in the NBA?  Steel's leader and the NBA leader.  There, twice. 
[02:56:00]  I don't know.  I'll take a guess and say Kobe.  Oh, no.  All right.  Who is it?  I thought I was going to fuck up and be the only loser.  All right.  Well, who is it, B?  Why would you pick a question that you think you might answer?  There you go.  Well, you know, I'm a basketball fan, and I don't know shit about hockey, and, you know.  All right.  Who is it?  All right.  Who is it?  It's Chris Paul.  Chris Paul.  All right.  You a Mormon?  Hell no.  No?  I'd be listening to you if I was a Mormon.  I don't know.  Bella Donna's a Mormon. 
[02:56:30]  I have a couple of Mormon listeners.  You got, like, a bunch of fucking...  I'm a godless heathen.  ...one husband and a bunch of wives.  Like that stupid big love show.  Hey, I got a bunch of wives.  All right, Chris.  You got a gift card, they're called, from Steven Singer.  $250.  250 smackaroos.  That's everyone that didn't win.  I hate stevensinger.com for your jewelry needs.  There you go.  And your Valentine's needs. 
[02:57:00]  That's it.  Hold on a line, Chris.  I don't want to get my girlfriend candy, because, A, I'll eat most of it, and, B, I just  don't want her getting fat, because then I'll be forced to dump her.  I actually weigh her every morning, and I'm like, if this goes above a certain thing,  you're out-ski.  But candy's an awful gift.  What's the number?  100.  100.  100 pounds?  Yes.  Anything over that?  Yeah.  Gone.  I see a rib, you're out.  I mean, if I don't see a rib.  You don't see a rib.  I'm tired.  I get nervous around gold. 
[02:57:30]  Well, we're wrapping up.  You got anything else there, Steven Singer?  No, that's pretty much it.  Steven Singer.  I've shamelessly plugged these roses.  Do I get a rose?  Absolutely.  Yeah.  I want one.  Which one is whose?  I'm taking the red one, because I got a rose.  We have a whole shipment here for you to pick out whatever you guys want.  Oh, nice.  Everybody.  I'm going to go classic red if you have another one of those.  Absolutely.  Can we look at them?  Are these, like, the second most popular?  The red is the most popular.  That's nice.  Aside from that damn blue one.  And, well, the blue sold out, like I said. 
[02:58:00]  And that orange one looks pretty cool.  That's called peach.  Peach.  Peach.  I'm colorblind, Steven.  I should tell you that right now.  But we have many, many colors.  There's, I don't know, eight, nine colors on the web.  And then we have some other premium colors that are available in store for anybody that's in the Philly area.  Except the Jews don't call.  Right, no.  Steven doesn't like that.  You see a blue one?  Can I ask you?  Yes, you can.  Can I ask you a dumb question?  Sure.  You think throwing maybe some, like, sports logos on there would help sell?  I don't know.  Sports logos. 
[02:58:30]  But we do have people like that.  I'm telling you, Philly girls are fucking insane.  Now, we have people that want it green for Jets or for the Eagles.  So they do.  I mean, people that do want different things, yeah.  Colors, yeah, but you don't want the logo.  Or, like, yeah, the Flyers colors or something.  You can kind of do it without putting the actual logo on there.  That is nice.  Which one is that?  That's the blue sold out one.  Give me that fucking blue.  That's crazy nice.  Can I get a blue and a red?  Sure.  Why not?  Oh, man.  And an orange?  Oh, you'd have to ask me a question and stump it. 
[02:59:00]  Wow, that's nice.  I want to stump you like Kunta Kinte.  See?  Stumps.  Can they cut off his foot?  Yes.  Damn, that's nice, man.  That is a nice one.  All right.  Very regal looking.  Yes, it is.  Yeah.  It's a great gift.  It's a no-brainer.  Guys are pretty stupid, and this is an easy no-brainer.  And you guys offer, listen, you've got four or five great Valentine's Day gifts that you  guys offer, you know, pro showers and other things that are very nice.  It's not about them right now, Stephen.  That's right.  But, you know, it's a nice thing, and you help guys that are like me that are stupid 
[02:59:30]  out, and they can get hooked up, and they get credit for it, and it's cheap.  It's nice.  It's great, and it's very fast, easy to order.  Just go to the website.  IHateStevenSinger.com.  There's a flaw in this one.  That's defective?  That's why we brought it for you.  That is a heavy one.  That's a lot.  It's like a weapon.  It's like a weapon.  Yeah.  That is...  You can do damage with this.  Very nice.  That's very nice, Stephen Singer.  Is it like silver if a werewolf attacks?  That's it.  You can stab it in his heart.  Shotgun. 
[03:00:00]  That's it.  And a barrel.  I'll keep going with this.  Why is it going?  You want to wear it?  I like feeling the leaves, because the leaves are very pointy.  Like, I like the way the leaves feel.  Like, you can actually hurt yourself with the leaves.  Jimmy's thinking of how he can injure himself.  An S&M rose.  No, but they really are cool, man.  Yeah.  Can I just say something, though?  One thing that I'd be amiss if I didn't...  I was invited to see at the Borgata, to see Norton and Brewer and Attell, and they were awesome. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, you went?  They were...  I was there about three weeks ago, and I went backstage.  Nobody was there.  Everybody was watching a football game, I think.  Oh, we got it already?  Oh, okay.  And...  Wasn't that a great show?  But it...  And listen, these guys are always funny.  Great lineup.  But, you know, when Brewer tells that story about his dad, and I've heard him tell it on your show,  but he has time to really go into it, you know, for like 15, 20 minutes.  And, you know, Norton comes out, and then he goes...  He's like the emcee, and he goes in and out, back and forth, so he's like funny, like 50 different times.  You know, he's before, after, during, all that type of stuff.  Thank you, man.  And it was, anybody who hasn't seen it, it was great. 
[03:01:00]  And the people there, you know, are so, they're like ravenous, you know what I mean?  They're solid O&A fans and stuff like that.  Loving the shows.  And everything was great.  I enjoyed the show.  Everything was terrific.  And they were funny.  And the people I brought couldn't thank me enough.  They said it was really great.  One downer.  Oh, no.  This was my one complaint.  Thank God.  I was getting scared.  Oh, boy.  I was hoping for the book.  About four seats away from me, Bobo.  Oh, shit.  And he is friggin' talking to everybody and going on. 
[03:01:30]  And, hey, you know me.  I'm Bobo.  And Bobo.  And he's like, I'm trying not to make eye contact.  I'm trying not to look at him.  I said, how the fuck?  I feel like I'm getting treated like a VIP.  I got a VIP bracelet to go backstage and go to the thing.  I got a thing to go meet and greet and do all this stuff.  And I got tickets.  I said, I'm like, you know, I'm getting treated nice.  The guy that supports the show.  Finally, right?  Finally, I'm getting a little something.  A little ass because it's nice.  And I'm sitting next to fucking Bobo, right?  There's no reason that should have happened.  That brought me right down to reality. 
[03:02:00]  Your name is I Hate Steven Singer.  It's not I Like Steven Singer.  Well, there you go.  Why would we put this next to someone nice?  So my wife, yeah, you're a real big shot sitting next to Bobo, sitting next to this mental patient.  Oh, that's hilarious.  So it was good.  Do you know that I can't announce it now, but we're doing the Anti-Social Network again in another venue in April.  The announcement will be Pride Monday.  What area of the country should we be looking for?  I don't know East Coast.  Maybe.  I don't know East Coast.  I don't know East Coast.  Maybe.  Well, anybody that hasn't seen it, you'd be crazy not to see it. 
[03:02:30]  It is a couple hours of fun, man.  They are hilarious.  Back there.  You're like, you can't even stop laughing.  They just hit you one after another after another.  And it is really, really good.  You almost want to stop.  There's so many laughs.  My side was hurting.  You know what?  I tried to remember.  There were so many different jokes.  And I tried to remember someone so I could steal them as my own and tell other people.  But they're so rapid fire, you can't even do it.  How about my opening joke because we're in a casino, I'm like, they said the media gamble.  I said, you bet. 
[03:03:00]  And you can picture just two hours of that.  Comedy madness.  It's a laugh a minute.  We've got to get out of here.  Stephen Singer, what do you want?  IHateStevenSinger.com is the big plug.  That's it.  Or 888-I-HATE-STEVEN-SINGER.  Just dial it.  On the telephone.  Just dial it.  It'll start ringing.  Go in there to see all the hot women that work at the joint.  On the other corner of 8th and Walnut over there in Philly and see all the hot women.  Ask Sam and E-Rock and the boys would have been down.  They'll attest to it.  Were you having a likelihood, no, I don't want to look.  Was Jess with you? 
[03:03:30]  She was with me the second time I went to resize the ring.  But when I went to become a diamond expert, which I am now.  Of course.  Thanks to Stephen Singer.  I had to go back a second time, right?  He educates you.  Yes.  And hopefully you'll have the same fate as the diamond merchant that followed fucking Zell.  Good throat cutting.  Essence, eat.  I gave him a whole handful of diamonds and made him eat them.  Oh, you must love that.  Yeah, sure.  I told you I hate the Jews.  All your best stuff's in a coffee can.  Oh, that's great.  Now, when Sam was getting engaged, it was all done and it was finished. 
[03:04:00]  I tried to talk him out of it two, three times.  I said, no, no, this is it.  Then I brought over like 15 girls.  I said, look, this is what you're never going to get again.  I just made them suck when I look and just jewel.  I wasn't sure if it was a jewelry store or a model factory.  Yes.  Oh, what?  A model factory?  Like supermodel.  Where are those?  Hey, listen.  It's just as easy to hire good-looking girls as ugly girls.  So might as well go for the good-looking ones, right?  Exactly.  You are right.  Exactly.  Ugly girls shouldn't have jobs.  I mean, I'm saying this. 
[03:04:30]  They should be unemployable.  Especially ugly Asians, especially.  They're the ones, right?  Oh, yes.  Jesus.  I got Steve.  Give Uncle Nino a run for his money.  Stephen's out there.  Their whole job should be to have rotten fruit thrown at them.  That's all ugly girls.  That should be their job.  They should stand behind supermarkets and you can throw rotted fruit at their unpleasant faces.  And that's their job.  Zelda's got the 11 to 6.  Sorry.  Well, I'm thrilled that you guys re-signed.  You know, we signed.  What did you take?  A three-year deal?  Two.  Two-year deal? 
[03:05:00]  Something like that.  Well, whatever your deal was, we re-upped.  I said, just mirror my deal is the same as yours.  So we're here for the duration.  Yours is shitty, too?  Yes.  Exactly.  And I didn't get Super Bowl tickets.  I got the same exact deal you got.  That's wonderful.  And they still had a low ball us.  Thanks for that.  Stephen, we definitely appreciate the fact that you are.  No, thanks.  Absolutely.  Our friend of this program.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks for having me in.  I appreciate it.  Thank you, sir.  And thank you.  Very gorgeous assistant.  Leanne.  Leanne.  Goddamn Leanne.  We're out of here.  Uncle Nino's Bad Jokes and Wine as we leave you today. 
[03:05:30]  See you tomorrow.  You know him as Vinny's lovable uncle from MTV's Jersey Shore.  Oh, what the fuck?  Now the Sicilian funny man brings his act straight off the boat and onto Broadway.  Listen, I guess I can't say something.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  Let me fucking talk.  Uncle Nino presents Bad Jokes and Wine.  I've been drinking all fucking week.  We make a toast to the crack that never heals.  The more you rub it, the better it feels.  You can scrub it from here to hell.  You never get rid of that fishy smell.  I'm fucking for me.  I'm fucking for you. 
[03:06:00]  Come see what nobody else will as the stereotypical Italian recites line after line of adolescent  toilet humor.  First time I had sex, I was so scared, I was all by myself.  I says, I was with this girl.  I says, honey, is it in?  She says, yes.  Well, start walking towards me now.  Oh.  I asked this guy, I says, buddy, did you ever see the numbers on the condoms?  He says, what numbers?  So I guess you don't have to roll it back that far, huh?  Wow.  Never before has an offensive cartoonish caricature told so many bad jokes in one hour, writes  the Daily News.  Oh, wait. 
[03:06:30]  What do you call?  What do you call a fat chick?  Chunk.  What the fuck?  How come only brothers could play basketball?  Why?  Because you got to know how to steal, run, and shoot.  Yeah, he's insulting.  What the fuck?  I laughed once, then wondered why I had, said the New York Post.  Yeah, I have to say one last thing.  I'll shut up.  Yeah, I probably should have shut up.  I love black women.  I always take a shot in the dark.  And when asked, the New York Times said they didn't bother to show up and review it.  I was with this girl.  I says, miss, did you ever see the news?  60-second orgasm? 
[03:07:00]  Says no.  So you got to fuck a minute?  What the fuck?  You know what I mean?  It's Uncle Nino's Bad Jokes and Wine.  Hey, God bless everybody.  Who gives a fuck?  Live on Broadway for as long as people still give a shit about the Jersey Shore.  What the fuck?  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  The O.B. and Anthony Show, damn it.  On the virus.  Sirius XM. </pre>
