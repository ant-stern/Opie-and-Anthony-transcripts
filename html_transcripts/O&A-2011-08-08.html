<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie and Anthony joking about Opie's recent suspension, blaming Anthony.  They then transitioned to a discussion of Howard Stern's bootlegged copy of "Super 8," criticizing the film's excessive lens flare.  The conversation shifted to violent incidents at the Wisconsin State Fair, focusing on racially motivated attacks against white people.  The hosts expressed outrage at the media's perceived downplaying of the racial element, analyzing news reports and social media reactions like the phrase "Who gone stop me?".  Listener calls detailed personal experiences of violence and bias at the fair, including one caller's bizarre anecdote about an older woman inappropriately putting her finger in his baby's mouth.  The hosts contrasted this with a fatal attack on a black man by white teens in Mississippi, highlighting the perceived disparity in media coverage.  Other listener calls described a Philadelphia bus shooting stemming from a child-spanking incident.  The show briefly touched upon "Bridesmaids," Colin Quinn's tweets about "Goodfellas," and upcoming guests, including a segment featuring "Les Zeppelin," before concluding with listener "F.U." messages.

The next segment started with a confusing discussion about Gary's return from vacation, punctuated by vulgar interjections.  This transitioned into movie reviews, deriding "Bridesmaids," "Barney's Version," and "The Hangover 2."  A caller, Danny, announced his six-month absence due to a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosis.  A graphic discussion of parasites and intestinal worms ensued, fueled by one host's viewing of "Monsters Inside Us," featuring offensive language and personal anecdotes.  The conversation returned to movies, with a lengthy, rambling critique of "Barney's Version" focusing on Paul Giamatti's performance. One host shared an unpleasant experience visiting his elderly mother in a nursing home.  This led to a crude discussion of herpes, including sexually explicit anecdotes and jokes.  The segment concluded with movie reviews and speculation about upcoming films like "Apollo 18" and "Planet of the Apes," along with their own movie project, "Women Aren't Funny," attempts to get screeners from Howard Stern, and a pre-recorded "Primetime Sam Roberts and One Question" segment with Christian Slater. A comedic bit with Rich Voss and Bonnie also aired.

The following segment began with a sexually explicit monologue before Rich Voss joined in-studio. The conversation turned to Tiger Woods firing his caddy, Steve Williams, and Williams' subsequent success with Adam Scott.  This sparked a profane debate on the concentration levels in golf versus other sports.  Voss and the hosts discussed golf and caddying, with a caller sharing caddying anecdotes and newspaper delivery stories from Voss's youth.  The deaths of American soldiers in Afghanistan were briefly mentioned, followed by a discussion about Lincoln Tunnel toll increases and EasyPass.  The main part of the show concluded with an in-studio performance by "Les Zeppelin," an all-female Led Zeppelin cover band.  The hosts and Voss engaged in banter with the band, making jokes about their name and sexual orientations.

The next excerpt detailed "Les Zeppelin"'s live performance, interrupted by a headphone malfunction.  Post-performance banter continued, with comments on their appearance, sexual orientation, and musical abilities.  The hosts announced a mass wedding event the band would hold at Irving Plaza.  The "After O&A Live" segment with Sam Roberts followed, focusing on the misspelling of "Les Zeppelin" as "Les Lepplin" on the run sheet, blaming staff member Derek.  The "sex buzzer" gag and Eric Nagel's early arrival due to breathing difficulties were discussed.  A lengthy audio clip of Sabra Cadabra (a Black Sabbath cover band) performing with Chubby Checker was played.  The segment built anticipation for a surprise guest, revealed to be Lea Thompson.

The final excerpt featured an in-studio interview with Lea Thompson, promoting "Switched at Birth."  Back to the Future themed music played during her introduction.  She discussed the show, her career anecdotes (including favorite "Back to the Future" scenes and "Howard the Duck"), and recognition from past roles.  The hosts discussed the show's recent success, crediting their new talent booker, Roland, and his assistant Spencer, for booking high-profile guests like Nick Cannon, Loverboy, Weird Al Yankovic, and Ron Bennington along with Sam Roberts.  They also discussed SiriusXM internal dynamics and the challenges of guest scheduling.  Other topics included their opinions on "Bridesmaids," a comparison of Justin Timberlake and Ashton Kutcher's films, and perceived bias in movie reviews. Don Cheadle made a brief, unexpected appearance, and a clip of a past interview with Marion Barry was played. Steve Sterniolo, a guest, was asked to leave for making inappropriate comments about Leah Thompson's daughter.  The show concluded with an announcement of an upcoming phone interview with Bill Burr and a short clip of Leah Thompson singing from "Howard the Duck," along with an anecdote about Opie's hasty studio exit.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's O.P. and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:00:30]  Today's O.P. 
[00:01:00]  Today's O.P. 
[00:01:30]  Today's O.P.  Today's O.P. 
[00:02:00]  Today's O.P. 
[00:02:30]  Today's O.P. 
[00:03:00]  Today's O.P. 
[00:03:30]  Today's O.P.  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it.  The thing's out of control.  Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard, you know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mind?  It's not the most talked about, it's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to enjoy it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Yeah, you're good.  America's O.P.  America's most trusted name in news, the O.P. and Anthony radio show. 
[00:04:00]  Let's welcome our hosts, O.P. and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Good morning.  Good morning.  It's Monday.  Yuck.  I know.  And we even had a three-day, a three-dayer.  Well, yeah, because of my suspension.  Oh, right.  Yeah, that's right.  I read that on the Twitter.  Yeah.  So it had to be true.  It was true, yeah. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  God.  Can't talk about it, but I was suspended for a day.  It was beautiful how that works out, getting suspended on a Friday.  Yeah, and then you're back on Monday.  Sure.  God, that was a collection of dolts.  I said on Thursday we'll be gone tomorrow, so I guess they thought that I went and snitched  on you for something and got you suspended.  You snitch.  I blame you.  Yeah, that was ridiculous.  But I answered a two-part question with yes. 
[00:05:00]  That'll do it.  And it threw everyone in a tizzy.  Not everyone, just a few handfuls of people.  What happened?  I said, why is Opie suspended?  Why are you guys suspended?  Why are you guys not in?  Well, some idiot, you know, played perfectly into it.  They said, did you get suspended or did you take a day off?  So I just wrote yes.  That'll get the ball rolling.  That's all it takes.  I wrote yes.  That would be all it takes.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:05:30]  No, it just took a fucking day.  Is that okay?  Jesus Christ.  I think everybody okay?  Is everyone all right with that?  Settle down.  Settle down.  Don't worry.  Howard's back today for a couple days.  Yeah.  That's nice.  Now we know what he does at his time off.  He bootlegs fucking movies.  Like this guy doesn't need it.  He needs more money, I guess.  Whoops.  That got out.  I see you got a copy of the H Stern copy of, you know.  Super 8.  I might have seen a portion of the bootlegged copy. 
[00:06:00]  Where is the H Stern?  I see it in the photo, but what is it a photo of?  Like a TV screen?  Yeah.  It's in the upper right-hand corner of the picture.  Yeah, we get these copies too, and you kind of hold them close to your vest, but I guess  they're willy-nilly over there.  Yeah, yeah.  I've gotten screener copies, and I've been paranoid, you know, because you'll see a number  come up, and that number is attached to you.  But that's willy-nilly shit, because someone in that organization, obviously no one gets paid  around here, so you don't blame them. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Holy shit, I got a copy of Super 8.  I can make money off this.  Yeah.  Fuck, Howard.  Howard, he doesn't take care of me.  I'm going to fucking go bootleg this shit.  That's exactly what happened, by the way.  Yes.  Howard has no fucking idea this got out there.  Hilarious.  But when you got people that are, you know, working their balls off for minimum wage,  and there's one of these copies laying around, they're going to take their shot.  Yeah, that-  Too much.  Sorry.  That worked out well.  But that's exactly what happened.  Picture quality was great.  You liked it?  Yeah. 
[00:07:00]  Movie itself.  Not so good.  It was supposed to be a good movie, this Super 8.  Yeah, I know.  It was sort of like fucking Goonies.  Bunch of kids running around.  And then it just, like, there's no real action until, like, the end.  I didn't find it all that amazing.  It would have been a great movie if J.J. Abrams came in and did an interview with us, but-  Oh, yeah.  Then it would have been fantastic. 
[00:07:30]  He blew us off for that one.  I'll tell you, that J.J. should thank Spielberg.  Mm-hmm.  Just thank Spielberg for his shots, because he just pretty much took every Spielbergian  kind of push shot and shit like that.  Oh, really?  He loves that lens flare.  Oh, my God.  Star Trek.  There was so much lens flare in Star Trek.  It was crazy, but there was a lot of lights going off and everything.  But then in this movie, there's a lens flare up the ass.  He loves it. 
[00:08:00]  And then that roundy round shot he does, where people are talking, and he's going around  him in one direction, and then around in the other direction, and around that.  You're just like, God.  The lens flare works for Star Trek, because it's, like, in space.  Right.  But if you've got a scene where some dude's going to the grocery store and you're lens  flaring, maybe you're using it too much.  It really is just lens.  J.J. Abrams loves the lens flare.  So I guess people are goofing on it.  What is this?  Lens flare the movie?  Oh, very good. 
[00:08:30]  It's just a bunch of J.J. Abrams clips.  What does he use it for?  What is the, uh...  I don't know.  He just loves it.  And it's artificial lens flare.  Mm-hmm.  This isn't, like, your normal kind of lens flare.  Yeah.  I don't know.  He just seems to love it.  Gives it, like, a really gritty look.  Is that what it is?  It's supposed to be more dramatic.  Did Super 8 do well in the theaters?  I don't know.  It just did all right, huh?  That means it was kind of a bust, no? 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, I would say.  Well, this rise of the Planet of the Apes came out of fucking nowhere.  Yeah.  Dude, when I saw the trailer, and I think it was with Patrice, when Jimmy was out in L.A.,  I think that was only three weeks ago, maybe.  Mm-hmm.  That was the first I kind of heard of Planet of the Apes.  Yeah.  They kind of...  What were they doing with this movie?  They didn't have a lot of money to market it or something?  Well, they didn't overhype it like they did with the first remake with Marky Mark there.  Right.  So, yeah, they didn't really...  But, I mean, Cowboys and Aliens, we saw the first trailer right around Super Bowl. 
[00:09:30]  Right.  The Super Bowl, whatever.  And then, finally, eight, nine months later, it comes out.  I see the trailer for Planet of the Apes two to three weeks ago.  Yeah.  And when Patrice was talking about it, he's like, no, this movie's coming out soon.  I'm like, why are they just kind of keeping this under wraps?  Yeah.  Was that their marketing strategy, you think?  I don't know.  I did, over the weekend, hear about some live-action publicity and promotion they did for it.  You know.  But, other than that, I didn't... 
[00:10:00]  I haven't seen any...  What's that, Planet of the Apes?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was supposed to be great.  I mean, it's amazing how just life imitates art.  Yes.  What happened?  What did I miss?  I missed the apes acting crazy and taking over the streets or whatever.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Just.  Was that a marketing campaign by Hollywood?  Hurting people.  I don't know.  I haven't seen much.  Is this a scene from the movie?  I can't tell yet.  Yeah, I can't tell.  Hold on.  We're watching a video.  Yeah.  It could be a scene from the movie. 
[00:10:30]  It's on YouTube.  Yeah.  I don't know if YouTube would allow that.  It didn't happen in Milwaukee, did it?  No, no, no.  It's probably not something else.  I'm sure Rise of the Planet of the Apes, you know, something.  It happened all over, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a planet of the apes, not like City of the Apes, right?  Oh, wow.  That's a good.  Oh, boy.  That's a good hair pulling fight.  That's.  Why do they go for each other's weaves every single time?  That's the move, right?  Where's Caesar?  He's like the head ape, right? 
[00:11:00]  Wrong scene.  Oh, is that the.  That's.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I don't know.  Wowie Kazowie.  I couldn't be happier.  I wasn't there.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God is right.  No one's really talking about this like it should be.  No.  Talked about.  That's for sure.  There's another thing I wanted to get to, too, was what happened in Wisconsin. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, yeah.  There was a state fair.  Right.  There was actual real people rioting.  Yes.  And no one was talking about the racial bias.  No.  A bunch of black people beating up white people.  No one.  And it happened somewhere else, too, I think.  What's the story?  I got the story.  It's blatant.  And the only reason they were beating up people was racially based.  It was.  They were white.  And black people were beating up white people.  Pull them out of their car.  And the Drudge Report talks about it.  But the mainstream media.  This has been happening a couple of times where whites are just being targeted by mobs and getting the shit beat out of them. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  And the fucking mainstream media is just not talking about it.  It's mind-boggling.  No, this is a huge racial attack.  Is Reverend Al talking about it on his TV show?  Oh, that fucking piece of shit.  He's such a shizbag.  He really is an asshole.  He's such a fucking shizbag.  What an ass.  I notice we're all getting more aggressive toward Mr. Sharpton.  I fucking, I felt good.  I brutalized him in my book. 
[00:12:30]  I mean, we brutalized him, I think, on the show enough.  We just, you know.  Yeah, I think everybody knows our stance on him.  Yeah, he's shit.  Well, I guess we'll go back to the movie talk in a minute or two then.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's fine.  So we've got to talk about the change-up and some other things.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, this, I guess they were leaving the fairgrounds.  Who?  White people.  Just white people in Wisconsin, right?  White people.  No, white people and black people were leaving the fairgrounds.  And there was a mob of what they said was hundreds. 
[00:13:00]  Of unruly teens.  Of unruly teens, yes.  Unruly teens is what the news calls them.  It was all black people, the mob.  And the victims were saying that they were attacking us.  It's absolute bias.  It was a military guy, a soldier.  He said it was absolutely biased.  They were absolutely attacking us because we were white.  And the media is, and this is how the fucking media out there, local media, they said, and  some claim racial bias.  Like, they just won't say what it is.  But what started the incident? 
[00:13:30]  Just, I don't know.  Black people gathered in front of this fair.  And as people left, they singled out white people, smashed them in the face, punched  them, dragged them out of cars, jumped all over the hoods and roofs of cars, pulled people  out of their cars.  Another, one white kid was laying in the street, just unconscious.  And people were walking by, kicking them in the head, throwing, like, signs on them.  And anybody that got out of their car and tried to help them got the shit beat out of them, 
[00:14:00]  too.  New York Post, Daily News.  I don't see it on the front page of the paper.  It's not interesting.  No, no, of course not.  Funny.  Of course not.  Oh, some say social media helped organize.  Well, it's true.  A lot of these flash mobs happen.  They get a bunch of people together and say, hey, let's go here and beat up white people.  I'm sorry.  I was just going to say, speaking of social media, I have noticed that the blacks are  taking over the Twitter.  They really do enjoy getting on the Twitter. 
[00:14:30]  The Twitter.  And getting into groups.  And causing some havoc.  I love hanging out in trending topics.  I don't even know what it means.  I don't even know what it means anymore.  It means let's go to the state fair and beat up white people.  There's secret languages going on now through Twitter.  And they're trending topics.  Can you go to the trending topics quickly?  It's infuriating.  I want to prove the blacks are taking over Twitter.  The Twitter.  Can you imagine if two white mobs in different cities had dragged black people out and beat  the shit out of them because the fucking Anderson Cooper would be there? 
[00:15:00]  Oh, yes.  Every single member of the high profile media would be there.  Oh, the press trucks would be set up.  They'd be, we're looking for these people in this heinous racial incident.  But, you know, white people getting beat up.  Whatever.  What do you expect?  That's what they do.  And blatantly getting beat up.  Here's a trending topic.  That means so many people have typed the following phrase that it's trending, obviously.  Right?  Who gone stop me?  Who gone stop me? 
[00:15:30]  G-O-N.  Who gone stop me?  Holy shit.  Who gone stop me?  I really am just about done with Twitter.  It's heading into just a weird fucking direction.  One person, right?  Jay-Z lyrics.  Oh, it's Jay-Z lyrics.  Okay.  Who gone stop me?  Wow.  Is that a song from Jay-Z?  Is that what's going on here?  Yeah.  It's off the new album.  Oh, fair enough.  Okay.  I guess.  Why are you? 
[00:16:00]  Is Gibbs Me Dat one?  No Church in the Wild.  No.  Murder to Excellence.  I'm telling you.  This is not good.  Gotta Have It.  That's your Gots to Have It.  Gots to Have It.  Gots that.  Gibbs Me Dat.  And then one of these dumb ones.  Almost band names with Jay-Z songs.  Gang, gang, gang.  Oh, really?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  So maybe today's not the day to check that shit out.  Jay-Z's.  Got an album out.  Yeah, he's got an album out, so it's a whole pop culture phenomenon. 
[00:16:30]  Here's audio from the news coverage of the Wisconsin State Fair mob attacks.  Right?  I wouldn't fucking go to a state fair if you paid me, by the way.  I know.  I absolutely would not go.  Imagine bringing your wife and kids to a fair.  That's not going to happen.  You have to deal with that shit.  Oh, my God.  Fucking animals just attacking you and you walk out for nothing.  It's just so much.  I don't need to punch in the side of the head for no fucking reason.  Gangs.  Sucker punching people.  Hitting them in the back of the head with fucking boards.  I don't need entertainment that badly. 
[00:17:00]  What am I going to see?  The strongest man at the state fair.  Lift things.  Win your girl a stuffed bear.  A stuffed bear.  You could do that.  I don't even know what the fuck they do at state fair.  You couldn't win anything because the guys in the midway shut down all their shit because  they were looting and taking the fucking stuffed animals.  Well, they were scared that someone was going to take their 75 cent stuffed animal.  Apparently so.  The cheapest shit ever.  Yeah.  If you want to talk state fairs, let's talk about all the shit going on. 
[00:17:30]  There was some gives me that going on there.  The stuff they fucking make you win at the midway is the worst shit possible.  Just what the fuck are black people doing lately?  What are you guys doing?  It's the unruly youths.  What are you doing?  It's all these fucking flash mobs.  What are you doing?  It's a, um, it's this new entitlement and new, uh, uh, the impunity.  Nothing happens to these people.  So they, they just continue it. 
[00:18:00]  There's no, there's no arrests.  There's no real fucking outcry.  There's no press.  There's no black leadership that's coming out against this.  And this has just been the way it is for years and years.  So that's what bugs me the most.  It's not even the fact that, that people are doing it.  It's just the way they cover it.  Yeah.  That's the only, because it was covered, honestly, you wouldn't feel like such a psycho  for thinking it.  Right.  Like if you saw the paper and they said, yeah, racially biased, uh, mob attack, you'd go,  oh, that's fucking awful.  And you'd get angry about it, but at least you'd go, I'm not an idiot to notice this stuff. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  And how about you just start mentioning it and maybe that'll put it in the, in the public  eye and, and someone will have a fucking answer.  There was a noose left at Columbia university on the door of a black professor by last year.  It was front page of the fucking local papers for two or three days because of what that  symbolizes and this, they talk about it and it's in the local news and they'll mention  the racial bias or the racism when they have to, but the media will mention it when they 
[00:19:00]  have to.  We believe there was racial bias because the man was heard yelling, get the white people.  Yeah.  All right.  Then they kind of have to, but they don't assume it.  Well, let's, uh, let's, uh, play this here.  Attacks were going on all over the Wisconsin state fair.  Unruly teen.  I've not heard this tape.  I guarantee it says unruly teens.  Unruly teens.  Gangs of youths.  Yeah.  A state fair in Milwaukee.  Wow.  Milwaukee's another one.  Another one.  That's another one.  This Wisconsin and Milwaukee.  Oh, there's two different ones. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  I was thinking Wisconsin was Milwaukee for a second.  You know what?  How close are the two?  They're kind of close.  No, dude.  I swear to God, I didn't realize that was the same place.  It's Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  I swear to God, I did not realize that Milwaukee was in Wisconsin.  Mark it down.  Today, I'm smarter than Jim Norton, officially.  Dude, I wasn't, when I.  I knew Jimmy didn't know.  That's hilarious.  But I was too scared to say I knew.  You should have.  When we were talking before, and I said, you know, another story I want to talk about  is Wisconsin.  I wasn't being funny. 
[00:20:00]  I literally thought that was two separate fucking stories.  Oh, my God.  Really?  I swear to you.  Whoopsie.  What an idiot.  All right, here we go.  Wasn't there another one somewhere else?  Maybe they're all the same incident.  I think it's 10 different locations.  One incident.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm an idiot.  Went to State Fair.  Old lady put her finger in kid's mouth.  Yeah, man.  Why would you ever go to a state fair?  What the fuck?  You got to slip and slide for your kids.  This video posted on YouTube, the person posting it saying it came from Thursday night's fair 
[00:20:30]  frenzy.  Two women viciously attacking each other, people cheering, profanity flying.  This fight, which is one of many inside State Fair Park.  Corey White was working his ring toss booth when police arrested someone right in front of him.  There were eight fights alone that I counted in the fair itself.  All told, police arrested 24 people for fighting.  Seven officers were hurt.  Returning today wasn't an easy decision for White. 
[00:21:00]  Scenes like this sparking concern and caution.  Being out here today, them kids messed State Fair up.  I mean, it ain't nothing like it was last year.  That has to be a black guy they interviewed.  Yeah.  So he was very concerned with what was going on at the State Fair.  They're talking about the fights in the State Fair.  There were fights amongst blacks in the fair.  Outside the fair, when people were leaving, that's when the mob attacked just white people  and left black people alone. 
[00:21:30]  And where's that story?  Where's that part of the story?  Well, they were walking by, because guys would say we were in our car.  White people said there was a black couple in the car.  They were walking right by and just going after.  I mean, it was obviously outside the fair.  It was racially.  Yeah.  They were just attacking whites.  Well, we got a part two to the story, so let's take a listen here.  Yes.  People are asking tonight, what motivated the attacks?  And there are answers in at least some of these cases.  Some people were singled out for violence because of their race. 
[00:22:00]  Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn says some of the attacks were racially motivated.  Many witnesses agree.  It was a mob of, well, four or five hundred black kids.  There were young black men running around beating on people.  And we're like, let's get the heck out of here.  And as the light turned, I got attacked from behind.  But city leaders point out the violence affected whites and blacks.  This YouTube video shows an altercation between two African-American females. 
[00:22:30]  Of course, the city leaders said that.  I saw incidents where there was, on the grounds, black on black, violence.  Well, I know that there was an individual from City Hall who was African-American who was there last night who was also a victim of violence.  So there are many people who are victims here.  Oh, don't try to fucking, were there any white people beating up black people?  How about that?  Black on black and then black on white.  Something's missing there.  White on black.  Could you fucking just call it like you see it? 
[00:23:00]  Just because there was black on black.  The fact is when people are just, when people are like, there's a mob outside waiting for people to leave and attacking them as they leave, which is what was happening.  Yeah.  That's what's annoying me.  At least, but you know what?  The media, at least, I was wrong.  I was, I stand corrected.  At least they, uh, they did, they did play the angle and they didn't fucking, uh, soft soap, but they did play people saying what it was.  Did you hear how hard it was for some people to say black?  Yeah.  They're like, it was a group of, oh, I got to say it.  Oh, I think I know what he wanted to say. 
[00:23:30]  Black people.  Oh, boy, I got to say it.  Oh, God, I hope they won't hurt me or my family.  They didn't say white people.  They were attacking people.  I can't believe I fucking didn't, I, honestly, I haven't slept.  I didn't realize that fucking Milwaukee was in Wisconsin.  Oh, my God.  Am I an idiot?  Uh, let's go to the phones.  Uh, people very upset.  Yeah.  At us?  Oh, no.  Um, not really, I guess.  Uh, where you want to start? 
[00:24:00]  Uh, you know what?  So it doesn't seem biased.  We'll just start from the top.  All right.  Nathan and PA.  Uh, Nathan, what's up, brother?  Hello.  Hey, I live down in Madison.  When I heard about that, they never even said it was black on white.  Um, they totally played it down.  But two years ago, the Milwaukee mayor got attacked outside the state fair.  That shit's been going on like that for a while.  The problem is, is all the blacks come up from Chicago up to Milwaukee. 
[00:24:30]  And that's where the trouble starts.  All the folks from Chicago are coming up to Milwaukee and causing damn trouble.  I don't know, I don't know why, like, the state legislature, like, the people, like, even  though I'm sure that that black assembly person got attacked, and there was definitely black  on black violence.  Oh, yeah.  But when, and just to say that a black and a white fighting doesn't mean that it's a  racial attack.  But when everyone is saying that's what was happening as we left the fair, I don't know  why the assembly needs to go, yeah, but look at the, like, why they have to soften.  Two black people were fighting, too, so, uh, Pearl, they were just fighting. 
[00:25:00]  Why do they have to diminish the other part?  I don't understand that.  Yeah, that it was absolutely racial.  Barry, look.  It's all the problem in Chicago.  All the trouble from Milwaukee, even in Madison, the same way.  We're having the same problem with the flash mob.  Keep that shit.  Just keep it.  Just give them the state fairs.  Who the fuck is going to the state fair? 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, who wants the state fair?  I'm obsessed with that.  Just go in.  I'm sure Sam's father used to work the state fairs with that fucking handlebar mustache  of his.  Did he just lift barbells with the roundy rounds on the ends?  The big round things, yeah, the spheres on each side.  With his singlet?  It said 100 pounds on each one.  Libs, LBS.  LBS.  LBS.  Yeah, just LBS.  In an old-timey fucking bathing suit with stripes.  And he had a stand to sell the world's most delicious treat. 
[00:26:00]  It was goat cum with crackers in it.  And then a black guy punches him in the face.  You know how you stay safe?  You don't go to state fairs and you become fans of white bands.  That's it.  And then you go to big concert festivals and stuff.  With white people.  I guess.  I guess in the end you're kind of right about that.  Never go to anything that has the name unity, peace, or any title of an event that rhymes. 
[00:26:30]  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like silence the violence.  Never go to something that's called silence the violence because there will be violence.  And it will not be silent.  All right, let's move on to the second phone call.  This is Charlie in Jersey.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hey, man.  What's up, Charlie?  Hey, there's a video I saw last night or early this morning on CNN.  There's a video that shows white teens running over a black guy in Mississippi. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, yeah?  So, I don't know.  I guess plain devil advocate, but.  It definitely happens.  And there it is right there.  How hate killed a man.  How hate killed a man.  Front page.  Front page of CNN.  How hate killed a man.  Good.  You know what?  That is headline news.  But the fact that they won't report the racial angle from the other way is my only complaint.  Yeah.  CNN.  All right.  Let's hear this.  I'd like to hear some of this.  Yeah, can we hear?  With a senseless murder of a man he never knew.  Nicole's in a relationship with John.  Mike wants to ruin that.  He's like a switch in his head. 
[00:27:30]  Like it's like a disease.  Odd.  That's fucking Sammy Sweetheart from Jersey Shore, Sam.  Yeah, bro.  There we go.  Who looks all bloated, by the way.  We got to talk about Jersey Shore later because everyone else is talking about it.  Hit it.  He is just 18 years old, facing a possible double life sentence for the senseless murder of a man he never knew.  Daryl Dedman is thin, short, with straggly blonde hair, accused of leading a group of white teenage revelers on a mission to find and beat up anyone who is black. 
[00:28:00]  Oh.  They discussed.  Let's go get.  I mean, let's be honest here.  Let's go get a nigger, right?  That's exactly what it.  Pause it right there.  The white reporter is saying that to the black guy.  This fucking phony fucking media.  Oh, man.  Let's be honest.  Let's go get a nigger.  Yeah.  You phony fuck.  He really didn't need to say that?  No.  No.  How do you know that's what they said?  You're not directly quoting someone. 
[00:28:30]  You're kind of taking their actions and going, that's what they probably said.  That's what they probably said.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  He was scared to say that.  Oh, he wanted to get away with it.  You hear it.  He's like, let's hummina, hummina.  He looks old.  I don't think he's going to.  Ed Norton?  I don't think he's going to cause a problem if I say it in front of you.  Let's hear that again.  I love that.  Teenage revelers on a mission to find and beat up anyone who is black.  They discussed, let's go get, I mean, let's be honest here. 
[00:29:00]  Let's go get a nigger, right?  That's exactly what it will show.  Hines County District Attorney Robert Shuler Smith says the evidence and witness accounts  tell a story of a crime that would seem to come right out of Mississippi's troubled past.  On June 26th, a group of white teens, seven in all, living an all-night party in the white middle-class enclave of Rankin County, Mississippi, in search of a black person to, quote, mess with. 
[00:29:30]  Pause it in.  Out of hate.  Out of hate.  Do you see?  And again, it is a real story.  Ominous music.  But do you see how comfortable they are?  Right.  This is my only issue.  They're so comfortable discussing it when it's that direction.  Yeah.  But when it's the other direction, they just, their comfort level is non-existent.  And I'll tell you something, you will find a fuckload more incidents of black groups of people looking to fuck with white people. 
[00:30:00]  But this isn't black people writing the copy.  Black, this is not a black reporter.  It's not like this is the BET news.  No.  These are white people writing this.  CNN, it's a, it's your liberal bullshit fuck dick fucking news organization.  It's all white people being fucking.  Of course.  I don't know if black people can't stand us.  No.  Patrice is right.  He's like, I've never met a racist.  He's right.  Yeah, yeah.  It's fucking really irritating.  All right.  Let's go to phone call number three.  Going down the line today.  Rich, Westchester, what's up, buddy?  Good morning, guys.  Good morning. 
[00:30:30]  Okay.  So matter of state fair, my wife, my two kids, I got a three-month-old in a baby carriage.  My baby's crying.  My wife's making a bottle.  Some old lady takes her pinky finger and puts it in his mouth.  I don't notice.  I'm on the other side of the carriage.  I come around.  I see your pinky in his mouth.  I'm like, boy, what are you doing?  Because my hands are clean.  I'm like, I don't know you.  I wouldn't put my fingers in your kid's mouth.  So what'd you do? 
[00:31:00]  What'd you do?  I called the cops.  Ah, fuck.  You knocked the bitch out.  That's what I would have done.  Wait, any fucking old lady puts her pinky in my kid's mouth, I can guarantee I'm knocking  her out.  Was that an old lady just trying to make the kids stop crying?  That's an old school trick, probably?  I guess.  Yeah, but this guy didn't know her.  No, I know.  Know her?  My wife was so upset.  I was being held back by the people over there.  It was a big scene.  I mean, a huge scene over there.  No, you didn't, because she walked away. 
[00:31:30]  Absolutely.  No one's holding me back from punching out an old lady, I'm telling you right now.  Punching an old bag in the face.  Oh, fuck yeah.  No fucking ladies putting a pinky in my kid's fucking mouth.  How old was the lady?  She was probably 60, 65.  What, you couldn't take her?  Yeah.  At least push her down.  Yeah.  Mush her face.  Give her a mush.  Yeah, give her something.  Until she falls down.  Why you?  You old bat.  All right, Rich.  Thanks for your state fair story.  I don't know why people go to state fairs.  You're not that desperate for entertainment. 
[00:32:00]  You can't be.  Crazy.  That's a good question.  A lot of people are wondering.  Dan in Jersey.  Dan?  Hey, I was just going to say, what if, like, I don't know what the gun laws are over there,  but what if, like, you know, Ant was over there and he was packing, he's got his right to carry and everything,  and he popped one of them off.  You think that, you know, that would be a big story in the news, or he'd have to face a whole bunch of bullshit.  Oh, that's a tough situation to be in, because there's so many.  I don't know.  Yeah, yeah, you're kind of limited. 
[00:32:30]  You might just get yourself in more trouble.  I don't know, man.  To take the gun away from you and use it on yourself.  No one's running at you if you had a gun and you're popping people.  Everyone's avoiding you.  If you start shooting like that, that's clearing the area.  Yeah, yeah.  They don't know if you're a cop or who the fuck you are.  That's one of those situations, again, if you feel like your life is being imminently threatened,  then you have the right to draw on somebody, you know?  Hey, one more thing, man.  I just want to say before I go, I just want to thank you guys for always saying the fucking truth 
[00:33:00]  and telling how it is, man.  You know, everyone else is too fucking pushy to say it, so.  Thanks, man.  That's nice, actually.  It'll eventually get us fired, but thank you.  Yeah, eventually.  It's really nice.  Somebody will catch on to what we're saying and be like,  oh, oh, oh, racist, oh, this, that, the other, but fire them,  or else we'll protest.  Fuck you.  Yeah, we don't care anymore.  But where is Sharpton and Jesse Jackson talking about this?  They just won't fucking address it.  No.  No.  And I wish the media just doesn't fucking, like, how hate killed a man. 
[00:33:30]  They're so comfortable talking about it.  That's a whole story right there on the fucking front page.  How hate killed a man.  It's an entire fucking story.  We didn't even listen to a tenth of the fucking thing.  It's a whole big, long story, and it's about how, you know,  seven, I guess they said, white guys killed a black man.  How about here in New York?  We talk about Fat Nick a lot, because let's just say that guy was killed.  With Fat Nick and his guys, the guy had a baseball bat.  There was three of them.  There was three of the other guys.  They came back in with bats to beat the black guys in the neighborhood 
[00:34:00]  who were there to rob cars.  Yeah.  He's got 15 years in prison.  It was front page news, I think, what, for 10 days in a row?  Yeah.  Front page news.  And the fucking guy didn't die.  He just got hit with a bat.  He hit with a bat.  He was in the neighborhood robbing cars.  It's because of what Nick said before he hit the guy that led him to be put up  on hate crime charges, which were a lot worse than just the basic assault  that he would have gotten, maybe.  But unbelievable.  Nick should be out soon, huh? 
[00:34:30]  He's been there for a while, man.  No, no.  He's going to be there for a long time.  That story's pretty old, though.  It's amazing.  A couple years.  How long is big, goofy-looking, fat Nick?  He's got to be medium Nick at this point.  You think he's working out?  Well, I mean...  We got some info coming in from Luke in Iowa.  Luke?  Luke.  Morning, boys.  Hey, Luke.  Hey, buddy.  Well, here's what's going on.  In the Midwest, we have a thing called Megabus now, and it's a government-backed program where  for $1, you can get a bus ticket from Chicago to Des Moines, Kansas City, Omaha. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, boy.  Holy shit.  Spread the virus.  Wow.  Chicago is like, here, just take this and go.  Yeah, please leave.  It's $1 if it's one way, and it's $500 if it's round trip.  That's just...  That's like allowing someone with TB to just cough openly.  Yeah, yeah.  Here you go.  Why would you allow that?  To clear out the neighborhood.  Why would you allow that? 
[00:35:30]  $1 bus ride.  Wow.  That's scary.  Wow.  Here's another.  London's been having some amazing riots.  Oh, no, a police shooting or something.  Yes.  Yeah, police shot a guy that was shooting at the police.  What are you going to do?  And apparently some people didn't agree with that.  And there's not a lot of guns over there, right, Ant?  No.  Was it a black guy that shot at the cops?  Yeah, I think there's some racial...  Do we know?  I think there's some racial...  And why are they burning down Krispy Kremes? 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, that was trending yesterday.  Burning down the Krispy Kremes.  They were, man.  It was a trending topic.  People really pissed off more about the fact that Krispy Kremes were being burnt down instead  of the actual riot itself.  That's probably a Jay-Z song.  Probably.  Burn down the motherfucking Krispy Kremes.  Yeah.  Nothing more embarrassing than when you want to get into a trending topic and have a cute  little line about it, and then some idiot slams you up, hey, Dick, it's a Selena Gomez  song.  Leave us kids alone.  I didn't know.  I didn't know. 
[00:36:30]  Leave us kids alone.  That's humiliating.  It's really humiliating.  Leave us kids alone.  I've had a few of those over the last year.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  It's a Justin Bieber song.  Oh.  Thanks, Luke, for that info.  That's great.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Mm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm.  Mm-hmm.  A real story is he didn't realize there are that many black people in Wisconsin.  That's coming in.  Well, you know, some of the big cities.  And the dollar, you know, bus trip. 
[00:37:00]  Wow.  From Chicago.  Wow.  When I was poor, that would have came in handy, man.  I would have taken a dollar bus ride.  Oh, yeah?  Fuck yeah.  Why not?  Enjoy the company.  I did some.  On that bus.  I did some greyhounding.  Be like that one bus in Philly.  Yeah.  That's fucking.  These guys just got on that bus and started shooting like motherfuckers.  That was a.  That's a creepy video that's going around.  I'm sure.  Do you know what that's about?  No.  Because the fucking.  And I don't know who the woman was, but I think there was a woman on the bus who hit  her who was spanking her kid, and one of the other passengers scolded her for it. 
[00:37:30]  So she called on her cell phone and told her brothers and her uncles or whatever to shoot  them when they got there or something.  That's great.  That's what that was about.  So they obviously know where the bus is going, so she calls ahead.  Oh, my God.  Why don't you get your guns and start.  Oh, my God.  Right.  Enough of the commercials.  Fucking.  I'm sure, though, that they were legal, legally owned guns and, you know, and stronger gun  control laws would have kept those two gentlemen from getting on the bus with the firearms. 
[00:38:00]  I don't agree.  Four people accused of a shooting at a bus full of passengers in Philadelphia.  CBS News correspondent Elaine Quijano is here with the story.  Well, Nancy, it's an incredible story, like a scene from the Wild West, only this has a  modern twist.  It's all caught by.  I didn't see any cow.  Not white.  Yeah.  Prosecutors say it started with a slap.  This was the shocking video shown in a Philadelphia courtroom Thursday.  According to prosecutors, on June 18th, this woman, Penny Chapman, seen here in the surveillance 
[00:38:30]  video, boarded a North Philadelphia bus with her young son.  Chapman began spanking her son for running through the aisles when a male rider intervened,  saying he would report her to child services.  We then see Chapman make a phone call, and minutes later, two gunmen in white shirts are outside  the bus.  Investigators say she called the suspects to come and shoot the man who threatened her.  Un-fucking-believable.  After Chapman exits through the back door, a third suspect holds the doors open as the two gunmen 
[00:39:00]  begin shooting.  Some passengers scramble to the front of the bus, piling on top of each other for cover.  You can see where the shots actually hit, exactly where people were standing or sitting, had  they not moved.  During the chaos, an 80-year-old woman stands frozen in place.  You see her very clearly because she doesn't actually realize what's going on.  Just in the nick of time, the woman ducks as a bullet shoots through the window, barely missing  her head.  Holy shit. 
[00:39:30]  Miraculously, no one on the bus was harmed, but all three men and Chapman are now facing  charges in this shooting.  Just an unbelievable story, Nancy.  Elaine, thank you so much.  And joining us now is Morgan Modell-Videz.  She's the assistant district attorney for the city of Philadelphia.  Sam, I think that the story there, I don't think, honestly, I don't think those guys are  trying to hit anybody because you can't shoot into a bus and just miss if you really want  to hit people.  Oh, really?  Nah, I honestly think that that's just guys who probably didn't want to tell her to fucking 
[00:40:00]  shut the fuck up because the woman needed help, so they wanted to be the fucking, man,  they should still go to prison for attempted murder, but I don't think they were trying  to shoot anybody.  You can't shoot, it's too easy to kill people on the bus if the door is open.  All you got to do is just stand there and shoot at people.  Yeah.  When you're shooting from outside, you can see what windows you're shooting into.  Oh, no, the fucking intent is there.  Yeah.  You're shooting into a fucking bus.  They should go to jail.  Absolutely.  Nah, they'll get nothing, believe me.  That's what happens.  Can you stay at a halfway house for like six months because of this? 
[00:40:30]  And then you'll find out when they finally do kill somebody that they've been arrested  20 fucking times, weapons charges, all kinds of bullshit.  Just use the laws that are already there, you cocksuckers.  Well, the one guy said that there wasn't no temp murderer.  He just shot Mike Mike in his heimparts.  I'm more bothered that that woman was spanking that child.  That's where I'm at in my fucking life.  I'm bothered that the fucking guy can just keep his mouth shut.  Who cares if that fucking bitch wants to smack her offspring or fucking her burden? 
[00:41:00]  Let her smack her little fucking burden on the ass.  Who cares?  Just keep your mouth shut.  You're on a bus.  What are you, saving the world?  What a douchebag.  I know a comedian named Veronica Mosey.  She's tall.  Veronica.  She got involved in a fucking incident on a train where the woman was hitting her kid.  And it just, she said, Veronica said she just snapped.  And she threatened the woman.  I guess it's a little different when it's a woman and a woman. 
[00:41:30]  But she told the woman, if you hit that kid again, I'm going to beat the shit out of you.  Nice.  Because she couldn't handle watching the kid get hit.  And the lady stopped.  I couldn't give a shit.  I would watch.  I would laugh.  Be like, ah, look at that kid's crying now.  Seriously?  Fuck him.  I wouldn't say shit.  No, I wouldn't say shit.  But that shit bothers me now, man.  What the fuck happened to me?  That ain't going to fucking...  When you see an innocent child that doesn't know shit about anything yet getting hit, it's  fucking brutal. 
[00:42:00]  For a few years.  Depends on what the kid, like sometimes, Louis CK has a very funny line about when he sees  a parent hitting a kid, he thinks to himself, what did that shitty kid do to upset that parent?  Like, it's hard sometimes to think that, like sometimes, some kids I want to see get smacked  who are just behaving horribly on a plane.  It's like, there's a line between don't beat up your kids and never, ever, you know, sometimes  the threat of your father fucking whacking you really does prevent you from being a kid.  I can only talk about the video I saw, a two-year-old is running up and down the aisle and she's 
[00:42:30]  spanking him for that.  Well, the two-year-old's running up and down the aisle, but she didn't punch him in the  face.  She put the kid over her knee and smacked his bottom a couple of times.  Who gives a shit?  Good.  The kid's running up and down the aisle, annoying everybody on the bus.  She took some action.  Well, bless you.  And then, uh, loud mouth had to make a fucking thing of it.  Loud mouth.  Put everyone else in harm.  And then fucking, yeah, then she's got to escalate it to the point of, you know, oh, he yelled 
[00:43:00]  at me, let's get fucking the boys down here with some guns.  Then again, maybe she was hitting the kid hard because I doubt she was just giving the  kid a little swat.  Any woman that will get on the phone and say, hey, this man scolded me, murder him with a  gun, is probably not doing good parenting in the moment before.  Yeah, I don't think she's giving a little love taps.  I think you're right.  Whatever.  I think you're right.  Oh.  Why don't we, uh, why don't we break?  Not be involved with that.  Get into some other shit.  A lot of stuff happened since we've been, uh, gone.  I have UFC talk. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, UFC talk.  Let's do that.  I want to talk movies a little bit.  So I finally saw that Bridesmaids and it drove me fucking nuts how awful this movie was  that Roland said is the greatest comedy ever made, basically.  Oh.  Anyone else see Bridesmaids?  Roland's a femme.  Did you like it?  It wasn't bad.  Oh, you're a femme too.  I mean, it wasn't overhyped when I had seen it, so it wasn't.  I tweeted, but that fat bitch made the movie tolerable.  If it wasn't for her, that movie would have sucked.  I also don't exactly take Roland's movie reviews seriously. 
[00:44:00]  No.  I've never given a bad review.  He is horrible.  But they're talking about how this was great.  It's like, uh, the female, uh, hangover, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  It was awful.  Awful.  It reminds me, too, of, there's a mafia movie that I'm working on, which is really showing  promise.  Yeah?  Yes.  Now or later?  After the break or not?  We can do it after.  It's just the guy, the characters are very good.  I don't have the whole thing worked out.  Yeah, so during the break, you can get your thoughts together.  It's a mafia thriller with some really good characters.  I look forward to that.  Well, uh, speaking of that, did you happen to see Colin Quinn's tweets about Goodfellas 
[00:44:30]  and how he would change it around?  Like a change-up?  Yeah, it was like the change-up.  He's hysterical.  Can we read?  Colin's tweets are great.  Can we get some of these for after the break?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, let's do this.  When you read him, though, to yourself, all you hear is Colin's voice.  And he's brilliant.  The guy's fucking hilarious.  I had lunch with him last week and he was talking about how happy he is when people  get annoyed at him.  How much he loves when they get annoyed. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, he loves it.  Yeah.  And we'll do some Jersey Shore and also, um, Stevie Williams.  It's a good little golf story happening.  We don't have to spend a lot of time on that, but it's pretty fucking hilarious.  All right.  Hit that there, E-Rock.  Gun crime, things like this, gang-related violence.  It's going to be minority.  Calling for me, hey.  Tell them to be, hey, hey.  I want to see you make a movie called Rolling for me, hey.  Calling for me, hey.

[00:50:30]  866-FU-LINE-1  That's 866-FU-LINE-1  Line 1  The Virus Series  This is the O.B. and Anthony Show  What happened to this band?  I love these guys  Wolf Mother  Any Wolf Mother fans? 
[00:51:00]  I like this  I like it too  It's kind of retro, right?  A little bit  Hey, when is the band  The girl band coming in?  Uh, 830  Is it today?  Yeah, we got Les Zeppelin coming in  And I hear they're gonna be leszing out  So I'm very, very excited  Because I told Roland  The only way we would book Les Zeppelin  Is if they leszed out  Uh-huh  And he promised me that they would les out  So  We're in for a treat  A little later this morning  What, uh  Dictates leszing out?  Uh, Lick and Box  Oh, right  Because any 
[00:51:30]  Two girls could just, you know, make out  That's easy  Yeah  That's like a Tuesday  Yeah, they're gonna les out  They're gonna be licking each other's boxes  In the fishbowl  In the fishbowl, wow  Yeah, we should have a big audience  Hey, Rich, what's going on?  I can't even imagine  Yeah  Hi, Rich  Rich  Rich Voss  Uh, I think Pat from Minaki likes this, uh, Les Zeppelin, right?  I think he booked this fucking band for us  Why is that?  Did he?  Yeah  I don't know why Les Zeppelin's on our show today  Well, because  I like Les Zeppelin  My publicist emailed me 
[00:52:00]  Yeah  And she goes, uh  She saw the lead singer in another band  And she goes, can I come in and watch?  They were great  Oh  No, I'm sure it's gonna be great  But I'm just saying  My publicist wants to come in and see Les Zeppelin  Plus they're gonna be eating box in the middle of the lobby  Yeah, they're gonna be licking box  Not eating box  Eating is, that's over the top  Just a little licking gonna happen  A little extreme  Yeah, that's a little extreme  Gary's still on a vacation?  No, Gary's, uh  Gary's back this week  Wait, who's Gary?  Remember the guy, um  Bald head  Your boss 
[00:52:30]  Wow  Do you wanna get fired?  No, no, no  No one is my fucking boss  Okay, you're right  I'd call him sort of  Some kind of supervisory position  Let's make this very clear  Okay  When was the last time we had a boss?  Mash, eh?  Be honest  Hey, boss  Ken Stevens, maybe?  Yeah  Tom Chiusano certainly wasn't our boss  No  Logan  Logan was a boss  Logan was a boss, alright  Steve wasn't your boss?  Steve who?  Steve C  Yes, I'm the boss 
[00:53:00]  I'm the boss of all come  And I commanded to go into my mouth  Don't ever say he's our boss  That  I'm sorry  That will never fucking happen  But he, um  He's back  He's back  Who is back?  Gary  What does he do?  He does a lot of, uh  Running the channel responsibilities  Now, we had, uh  I guess it was off for what?  A week?  Was it a week vacation?  Yeah, he was on vacation for a full week  And what, what happened to the show  That wouldn't have happened 
[00:53:30]  Or vice versa  Great question  If he didn't  Holy shit  Have taken vacation  I mean, last week  We actually had a great week of shows  Oh, it was amazing  The Guy Fieri fishbowl thing  Went off without a hitch  Yeah, A-listers  Yeah, we had a lot of A-list guests in  I mean, to the point where  The show was just fun  The countdown this weekend  We actually had to cut stuff out  That we didn't want to cut out  Because there was so much good stuff  So you're saying  That because he was on vacation  We had a great week  No, I mean  You happened to have a great week 
[00:54:00]  The week he was on vacation  So what?  So he's back today  Today is his  But how do we know?  How do we even know?  Because this is just like last week  Yeah  Great show  This is just like last week  So how are we going to know  That he's back?  Know why?  Because he's going to be  A fucking mosquito  Fucking buzzing around my head  A mosquito  That's why I'll know he's back  You know how useless  Fucking mosquitoes are  I hate them  I'll tell you this much  If he gets Sam  And the rest of the staff raises 
[00:54:30]  Everyone on staff  If he fucking fixes the studio properly  Right  Instead of patching it up with band-aids  Interns  And gets us interns  Then I'll at least acknowledge him  And have conversations with him again  Until then  Don't bother me  If you can email me  That's great  I'll still acknowledge email from you  But no more face-to-faces  Every email?  So he's back  You're just amazed by that  I'm amazed  Because I don't know what happened  That he was on vacation 
[00:55:00]  And how that was detrimental to the show  You're saying that because Monday feels  This Monday feels the same way  That last Monday did  Exactly  Nothing different  What could possibly be the difference  What would be the difference  With him being here or not being here  Is he actually in the building?  Because I'm not even joking  I have no idea  I cannot confirm that he's in the building  I will  So it's just like last week  Well maybe he hasn't gotten here yet  He should just stay on vacation  The company would never notice  We certainly wouldn't  You ever hear that saying  If a tree falls in the forest  And no one's there to see it 
[00:55:30]  Sucker cock  Did it work?  Yeah  No  Does it work?  If a tree falls in the forest  And all its hair falls off  Should it still wear glasses?  Poor Gary  He's a nice man  He tries  That's enough  What a nice man  I will acknowledge  Until I fucking get my ass kicked out of here  That he's a nice guy  I have a question  I have no problem with him being a nice guy  But don't fucking lead us  Because we don't need the help from you  What's your question?  I haven't been here in a while  I don't know  And I don't know if I'm stepping on any toes 
[00:56:00]  Or bring it up anywhere  That means you don't  He's probably eye level with toes  Shrimp  Your fingers  Why is he shitting here?  Why is he  Is somebody on vacation?  Danny's actually sick  Oh he's sick?  Danny's sick  He's got  He was diagnosed with  Not Hodgkin's lymphoma  So he's out for six months  You don't even get a call back for that  That's how bad you're at  Maybe because I was itching  I was itching my head  I don't believe this  I didn't want to laugh  You fell apart  I didn't want to laugh  You've never itched your head before 
[00:56:30]  Your eyes got big  You were like  You're itching your head  I've never seen you itch your head ever  That was hilariously bad  I don't know  I didn't know what to say  You were like  You were actually never making up there  Just feel relaxed  Feel relaxed  Look relaxed  I just kind of improv that  So Gary's back I guess  To answer your question  Not mine  Because that one's going from Anthony  Anthony's just amazed  That the guy was on vacation  Because we didn't know  Fucking vacation  Yeah 
[00:57:00]  This Bridesmaids is going to go nowhere  I finally saw the movie  And it sucked  Did you see Bridesmaids  Nobody watches movies in this room  Hasn't it been out for a while  I saw the best movie  Well I was in a hotel  And I finally rented some  I should have rented the fucking  Woody Allen movie  I knew I had that  Made the wrong choice  I saw one the other night  You would have liked  What  Barney's version  With Giamatti  I saw it  Dustin Hoffman  I hated that fucking movie  You hated it  Yeah  Because it was  What movie  Barney's version  His acting in this  Is ridiculous 
[00:57:30]  And it's a good movie  But who wants to be that depressed  When they go to see a fucking movie  Well who was in that  Who was in that  Giamatti  Giamatti  Oh  He said it wrong  Oh sorry  It's one for the wall  He said Giamatti  Giamatti  Yeah we were waiting for a minute  Giamatti  I love it  Why don't you explain the movie there Rich  Because you saw it  I saw it a while ago now  I actually saw a screener copy of that  And I did not put it on the black market  I actually gave it back 
[00:58:00]  Wow  It was well acted though  You saw it?  Yes  Did you really?  Oh yeah  With Dustin Hoffman  Played his father  Yeah it was very very well acted  Yeah but it was downright depressing right?  What was depressing?  The ending you mean?  Oh I don't know  The guy's losing his mind  That's always depressing  It's already  That got me nervous  You know I was thinking last  I'm sorry to interrupt you  I was thinking last night  As I was trying to  I couldn't sleep last night  I was actually thinking about that airplane  That swooped down and picked up water  I don't know why I thought of that last night  It's very funny you mentioned that  There's a plane that swooped down on the lake  And scooped up water in that movie 
[00:58:30]  Yeah  Yeah  I was thinking as I fell asleep  That's an old urban legend  That they used in that movie  Right  Where you know  Oh did they?  Somebody was in the water  Yeah  Actually that was a nice twist  I agree  I think  What are you talking about?  The movie was good  But the guy losing his mind  Just fuck it  Well that was at the end  And he was almost 70  And don't worry about losing your mind  Because you won't know  So who cares  It's all the people around you  That have to deal with it  That want to smother you  I forget the pillow with the handlebars  You get depressed  Because the person doesn't remember  But the fact is 
[00:59:00]  If you're laying in that bed  You're fucking still skipping through life  You don't know any different  I went to a nursing home yesterday  To visit my mother  And I went there  And then I left to play golf  And I felt guilty  I didn't stay long  So I went back  I brought her cookies  I just brought a little bag  And I'm sitting there  And I don't want  I'm not trying to be gross or rude  But it's  You know  She's in the TV room  With all the other  And it stinks  Because half of them  Are shitting themselves  Oh god  And it's hard to stay there  Because like  And I don't know  Whether I should feel guilty or not 
[00:59:30]  But it's hard to stay  Because she won't even really remember  That I'm there  Or what do you say to somebody  You know what I mean  You're just sitting there  Like a house  We're in the same boat sort of  This is what you do  You go and play golf  And enjoy your life  Enough already  Really?  Yes  Enough  I'm serious  When she passes away  I'm going to play golf that day  And people  And they'll go  And all you have to do  Is say  That's what she would have wanted  Right  That is true 
[01:00:00]  She held my hand  And said play a lot of golf  That does work  You just gotta go  That's what she would have wanted  Hit under 90 for me  That's what you do  They live their lives  Yeah but you walk out  You feel so fucking guilty  Oh fuck that  Is it a nice sunny day  Enjoy the sunshine  And I also felt horrible  Like she's eating  And dropping food on herself  And I'm getting mad  Like you know  Fucking put the food in your mouth  But then I realize  She shakes  And you know  Nobody does it on purpose  How old is she?  Huh?  How old is she?  47  I don't know 
[01:00:30]  Like 81  And then I say  She doesn't make any friends  I go  You don't have any friends  She goes  They're all too old  I go  You're fucking old  You're 82  At least you guys  Have warm conversations  Yeah  You know  I just feel horrible  When you  Yeah  That's sad  And then fucking  Bonnie's been gone  For like nine days  And I don't fuck around  On Bonnie  But like  Even say I did  She fucked around on you  Is that what you're saying?  Even if I did  For nine days  That she was gone  I had the biggest  Fucking fever  Blister sore  On my lip  And it was like  The size of a  Fucking golf ball 
[01:01:00]  So I'm on stage  Even if I wanted  To get pussy  Who's gonna fuck me  With this fucking  Speed burp on my lip  Herpe  How'd you get your herpes?  How did I get it?  Yeah cause I'm still  Trying to figure out  How I got mine  Everybody gets a fever  Sore  They come and go  How'd you get your  Herpes?  It's herpes  It's a technical term  But everybody  It's a herpes tree  What's that?  It's in the herpes tree  It might not be the bad one  But it's part of the  It's HSV2 I believe  That's right  Not HSV2  And I've been getting them  Since I was eight  You have one  I have one?  HSV1  I think two  Oh you got one?  That's bad 
[01:01:30]  Oh  Or does he got two?  I don't know  I'm gonna guess he has one  You didn't scratch your head  When you went  That's bad  No it is bad  I don't have one  First of all  You're going by his diagnosis  Which one you got?  One or two?  I don't got either  I had a bump on my lip  You get it  Have you been getting those  Your whole life?  I guess  Then you have HSV1 dummy  I've never gotten one of those  Cold sores  Or fever blister  Whatever you want to call them  No  Really?  I just got to punch you  Many other ways  Most of the population  Has it at this point 
[01:02:00]  Yeah  What?  Most of the population  Has it at this point  Really?  We've been passing around  That herpes thing forever  Fuck yeah  I'm not even joking  The herpes  You got a percentage  I heard it was  75 to 80%  That's what I heard too  Have HSV1  And I heard like  25 to 30%  Have two  I thought everybody has it  You're born with it  Or something  No  How do you get it on your lip  From where?  Kissing  Somebody who has it  And when you were  You get it when you were a kid  Like some  I've been reading it since I was 8  Some fucking relative  Some asshole aunt 
[01:02:30]  Kissed me when she had one  That's what I'm assuming  Damn  Or maybe someone that was visiting  And they decided  My face was so kissable  They had to fucking kiss it  Sure  Sure  And now I'm stuck with that shit  Oh  I had the  I was watching  The show  Over the weekend  Motherfucker  That  It's called  The Monsters Inside Us  Oh yeah  It's all about bacteria  And fucking  Parasites  That could get inside of you  Nice right  And there was a black guy 
[01:03:00]  And he's  He got back from Iraq  I guess  And he's  He's eating  But not gaining weight  And  And then his stomach  Starts hurting  And he's like  But he didn't go to the doctor  He's just waiting  And waiting  So he had to take a dump  He figured  He figured he would  Flush his system out  By just eating  Like these vegetables  That he put in a blender  And shit like that  And juicer  And things like that  For days he was doing that  And then his stomach  Really started hurting  So he went to go to the bathroom 
[01:03:30]  And he said  He felt something wet  Slap against his leg  And thought he  Thought he had  He'd shit himself  Yeah  He reached in the back  Of his pants  And felt it move  And pulled a fucking worm  Out of his asshole  A giant fucking worm  How thick was it?  And that  You know what he does  Three times a week  How much worm  Was he able to take?  Oh he took a lot of worm  Was it thick?  Are you saying  There was one worm  In his stomach  That was eating all the food  Or there was a bunch  No it was a bunch in there 
[01:04:00]  Wasn't there just one?  No  Was it big?  Yes  Dude you just creeped me out  It was so fucked  I was watching this show  Going I can't fucking watch it  And I know I don't wash  My vegetables or fruits  So I'm gonna start  Washing them  You don't wash them?  Nah  Oh I do  You gotta wash the shit  Out of that  I don't eat that stuff  And it turned out  Like  And it always turns out  These shows  Just when you think  Like god I don't want  To get that  There was a couple  Got this parasite  Because they went to Africa  And got some catfish 
[01:04:30]  Out of a river  And the guide  Instead of cooking it  Decided to make  Some catfish  African river sushi  Nice  And they ate this shit  And fucking got like  Other kinds of parasites  Who has catfish  River sushi  From Africa  Another horrid one  This fucking woman  Wait the worm guy  What did the worm guy take?

[01:06:00]  Under her skin  In between the muscle  And the skin  Holy shit  And it was there  For like a week  She's just going  About her business  And I'd be like  I would cut that  Out of me  With a fucking  Knife  On the spot  Oh I absolutely would too  I couldn't live with that  Imagine you gotta wait  A whole weekend  Like Jimmy was saying  Until a doctor will see you  Well I guess you go  To the emergency room  Then there was this  College kid  And he had done  Something stupid  He'd gone to some  Dumb place  And ate something  Fucking retarded  And he got this

[01:15:00]  I guess that was a really funny scene  Yeah  I guess  I don't like seeing girls poo  Ew  And they're farting and stuff  Roland why was Bridesmaids  A good movie  Because I saw it  Because you would praise this movie  Over and over again  He praises every movie  Over and over again  Why was Bridesmaids a good movie  Um  You can check Rotten Tomatoes  It was just a funny chick flick  Funny chick flick  It got 21% positive reviews  Oh that's the change up  Wow  Oops  I might have missed the boat  On that one  Zoinks  Yeah this one got 90% 
[01:15:30]  Bridesmaids got 90% positive reviews  Everybody loved it  It's funny  It's like a good chick flick  It's like a dirty movie  For the gals  Oh god  I put it in fourth place  Out of the four comedies  I saw this summer  I put it in fourth place  I even said the change up  Was better than Bridesmaids  I enjoyed Bridesmaids  It's like um  Horrible  It was the first ever chick flick  That's dirty  That's why probably  Yeah  If you think about it  Like they'd shit their pants  I just watched the same movies  Over and over  Like Howard Hughes 
[01:16:00]  I just sit there  Watching the same fucking movies  New movies blow  Every so often  A good one comes out  I'll watch that  But  What was the last  What was the last  New movie that didn't blow in  First  Last new movie that didn't blow  I would really have to  Fucking take time  To think about that  Uh  Because  Think about it though  I would like to know  I'm trying to think  Last new movie that was good  Fuck  Oh what do you call it was good  With Liam Nilsson  Uh  Come on now  Now you're just doing this 
[01:16:30]  On purpose  No  Liam  What the fuck  What'd you say  I think you had it actually right  I'll tell you in a second  Say it  No I fucked it up  I know I did  But you know  Is there a bed waiting for you  With your mom  What's his name  Maybe you guys could go out together  And no one else  That was good  What was the movie  And what was the guy's name  You know  The dude that was in Taken  No we don't like the dude  We want you to say the name  So people can relate out there  They go  Oh I know what he's talking about  Liam Nilsson  Isn't it  Yes  Right  Okay  You got it right  That movie was pretty good 
[01:17:00]  What movie  I forget the name  Taken  No no  Taken was  You didn't like  Taken  Stunk  No I didn't  Oh you got Jimmy going  Jimmy  I remember Jimmy  Not liking this movie  Cheesy dialogue  A corny awful story  Yeah but it was good  The ex CIA guy  With his fucking  Soy sauce colored  Fucking dyed hair  That kills me every time  Because I can't even look  At Liam Nilsson anymore  And his daughter  With a retard run  The retard run  Terrible dialogue  Oh look the stepdad  Got me a pony  Lunker lunker lunker 
[01:17:30]  Lunker lunker  It was fucking awful  Hey Luke I love you  I bought you a Susie Bay cover  Oh stepdad got me a pony  Lunker lunker lunker lunker  Fucking stunk  And at the end he brings  The singer over  Go fuck yourself  It was fucking  In light  That one  Well the other one  Was good  You're talking about  Unknown  Yeah  Yes  That was good  With Liam Neeson  Did you see that  What was  Who was the star  In Unknown  Rich Ross  Liam Neeson  You just heard Anthony 
[01:18:00]  What  It doesn't matter  You'll learn by  Here or another  Right  I'm going to ask him  In a half hour  He's not going to  No  Not at all  Goldfish  Eight minutes  I give him  And what else  Yeah if he  If he left the studio  And come back  I bet you he can't  Get the name  Yeah  Rich could you  Can you humor us  Could you humor us  Go outside the door  And come back in  Go back to Jersey  Come back through the tunnel  We want to see  If you're like a dog  Supposedly if you have a pet  And you leave for a minute  Or a week 
[01:18:30]  They don't know the difference  That's what I've heard  So let's see if Rich  Will remember  You think he's focusing right now  I don't think he could eat  And think at the same time  So this might work  Alright  Is it enough time  For Rich to come back  Alright now Rich is coming back  Now this movie  Unknown  Who's the star of the movie  Liam Nelson  That was good  What else did I  Oh  The one with  Fucking Matt Damon  Source code 
[01:19:00]  Or whatever  I thought  What  The one where he  The angels  Came down  He finds the  The people there  That I  I don't know  I saw it  I saw it  I didn't think it was good  It wasn't  It wasn't bad  Is that what it was called  Source code  Adjustment bureau  Yeah adjustment bureau  No adjustment bureau  You don't like those  Source codes  I think that's the other one he's in  No Jake Gyllenhaal is in that  And I wish I would have  Let you say that  Close enough though  Yeah  Sounds like the same movie actually 
[01:19:30]  So I'm with Rich on that one  That was a good movie  Yeah  You didn't like it  No  It was  It was too weird  I think the  I think the last  Good  Really good  Amazing movie  I saw was the first  Fucking  James Bond  That one with  The first Daniel Craig one  Oh shit  That goes back a while  I know  That's old now  Well no  You liked Star Trek  The reboot  Oh Star Trek  Yeah  And that came out after that  Star Trek ruled  So now we're up to  Star Trek The reboot  For you  So what movies came out 
[01:20:00]  After that  Star Trek The reboot  I said it a few times  I'm not a Trekkie at all  And I really liked the movie too  That one was really good  Was it Dark Knight after that  You didn't have to be a Trekkie to enjoy it  Dark Knight with Liam Nelson  No with  Oh with  Heath Legger  Heath Legger  Legger  Legger  Yes  That was a really good movie too  Was that before or after Star Trek  That was before  Star Trek was 2009  Yeah that was before right  Dark Knight in July 2008 
[01:20:30]  What's the  That's three years ago already  Fuck man  What's the best thing I've seen  You were saying Captain America was really good  I haven't seen it yet  Is there a good superhero movie that was out  3D  Star Trek stinks  It didn't say what you want  I liked Avatar  I liked Avatar  I thought it was good  Yeah  I really liked Avatar  I know it's not popular to say that these days  Why not  I really enjoyed it man  I liked the fucking  What else did I like  I liked the Hurt Locker  But in all fairness to Avatar  I did start  Trying to watch it on regular TV 
[01:21:00]  And the movie sucked  Yeah  This is a 3D movie  But to get the technology  It was great  Yeah  It was great in the  In the 3D theaters there  But  What else was nominated  The last couple years  Because I saw a lot of the Oscar nominated movies  I liked the beginning of Inglourious Bastards  Oh yeah  I loved it  Except for fucking Brad Pitt stunk  Yeah  I ruined the movie  I like that  What other movies came out recently  I can't even remember  Inglourious Bastards was great  They're forgettable after you see them I think  Inception  I didn't see Inception  Oh I loved it  I loved Inception  Should I give that a shot 
[01:21:30]  Yeah  It's a brilliant screen  He won best screenplay I think  Or didn't he not win  Christopher Nolan did it  That was a lot of weird though  I loved it  I liked Social Network  But I don't know if it's  That was a good movie too  Yeah I thought that was really good  Yeah  That was just a good story though  Yeah  I like Precious  Yeah you know what  Precious was good  Precious was hilarious  God that was funny  That was a really good comedy  She gets that fucking pot  Thrown at her head  I'm watching  I'm reading his book now 
[01:22:00]  I'm almost done with  The Sex on the Moon  By Mesritch  Oh right  Fucking good man  Good  Yeah  Yeah  King's Speech  Very good movie  I bailed with 20 minutes left  Did you really?  I think that's when  It gets really good  Oh  I couldn't be bothered  With his stupid stammering anymore  Stuttering muttering prick  I felt like I was looking at myself  In a mirror  Enough already  That's funny  You couldn't be bothered  I just couldn't be bothered  That would never happen  In real life  How much do they have to  Pump up a real story 
[01:22:30]  To make it Hollywood  That shit would never  Go down like that  No  No  If you were the king  And you had a dopey son  That stammered his ass off  Right  And it's back in the day  When there was no TV  Just put a perfectly speaking gentleman  In front of the microphone  And say this is my son  Yeah this is my son  There you go  And then have the real  Adult in public  Just waving  Yeah  That's how you handle that  Oh no it was good  What  Oh you said  The Woody Allen one  I didn't see it though  What's it called  Midnight or something 
[01:23:00]  What's the Woody Allen movie called  Midnight in Paris  Yeah it was awesome  It was a good movie  Yeah why didn't I  Fucking rent that  We rented Bridesmaids  Oh Roland just gave it  The kiss of death  Saying it was awesome  How does he get  How does he write  So many good movies  In a row Woody Allen  He just does nothing  But write movies  He's had stinker  Yeah but still though  I find him dull  A lot of his movies  Woody Allen  Some of them are yeah  Brad Pitt's new movie  Looks awesome  Moneyball  Except for him I'm sure  Every movie looks awesome  When you've seen the trailer  Yeah Moneyball looks really good 
[01:23:30]  What's Moneyball about  About the Oakland A's  Oh  You know what  The town was awesome  Thank you Lou  That was good  In Yolkstown Ohio  I love the town  Did you see the town in it  It was alright  Yeah it was good  What do you mean it was alright  Who was in that one  Ben Affleck  Ben  Jeremy  Oh yeah okay that was good  Jeremy  What's his name  Renner  Jeremy Renner  That was very good  He's in the New Mission Impossible too  He's the guy in the flower shop  That guy Jeremy  Yeah  That was good  You didn't see the town  It was good  You had the blu-ray 
[01:24:00]  Yeah no I saw that one  Yeah  That was good  You like it  Yeah  Yeah that was good  I didn't think it had any dead spots  And the other one  The guy that was in that  Was in that Iraq movie  He was a bomb squad guy  Yeah yeah yeah  Hurt Locker  I liked Hurt Locker  Yeah that was a surprisingly good movie  There was a good one with Ben Affleck  Where  Yeah I know the town  No they all got laid off  The Company Man  The Company Man  That was pretty good  Oh I didn't see that  Yeah that wasn't bad  Oh yeah  This was a good one right here  Oh god  It's called The Rich Voss Story

He got a distributor  Just to do blu-ray  And on demand  I think you can probably  Make more money  Hmm  What is going on?  Oh man  Interesting  Why would you want to  Put it in theaters? 
[01:25:00]  He said press release  They're going to  First it's going to go on demand  And then the next following week  Is blu-ray  He's had enough of that shit  I like Red State  Mm-hmm  It's really good too  Huh  They're trying a new way I guess  Alright let's see what happens with that  Because I definitely liked Red State  My stamp of approval  I like the change up and Red State  Oh boy  Change up  What was it?  13% positive reviews?  22% positive reviews?

That one's people  People are getting raves  Yeah I'm going to see that  It's supposed to be great  I like Patrice talking about it  Um on Twitter  Yeah  And bouncing people  Fucking just banning people  Or letting them live  And Joe Rogan  Said he saw it in an all black theater  And uh  He said  It was a great experience 
[01:26:00]  He goes  It didn't even bother him  Having toddlers running around the aisles  And hearing people go  Oh he in charge now  Is that what really happened?  He's hilarious  Is Rogan up?  Rogan's hilarious  No he's not that  He's probably  Nah man  Rogan what the fuck  Stay up so he can do some radio with us  Get this message back to Joe for us  Hilarious  Rest date  September 1st  On demand  And on Blu-ray  October 18th  Said the next week  It would be on Blu-ray  Well that's  But they punched it  And people are saying  Don't waste your time with Inception 
[01:26:30]  I loved it  Let me go to Tony of Florida  I have not seen all of Inception  I fell asleep  Three attempts at watching it  Three attempts at watching it  And I fucking fell asleep  Inception  What is it about dreams?

Hey Tony  Hey Inception  Don't waste your fucking time 
[01:27:00]  It sucked  I started for the first time  I'm gonna say it sucked  See I really liked it  I mean I guess  You know  You think Howard's got that one in his stash?  Give me to you  I don't know  Maybe we can  Now that Howard's a pirate  Arr  Arr  Pirate movies  Arr  Can you go down the hall  And ask if Howard's got Inception  Because I really don't want to pay for that one  I can't get in that area  Why?  Can you at least try?  Can you knock on the door  And can we get a list of movies together for Howard?  Yeah  See if we can get some DVDs 
[01:27:30]  Arr  He's a pirate  He's out on the streets  With the blanket out  Selling  With the Koreans  With the Korean  Howard and the Koreans  Ah what do you need?  What do you need?  Arr  Arr  Pirate's booty or something  Oh  That documentary was great  Yep  About the meltdown of Wall Street  Yep  What was it called?  I think it was Inside Out  Job  I think  And won the Oscar last year  I watch a lot of documentaries 
[01:28:00]  That's what I do  Yes  I watch a lot of those  But yeah  Because movies just fucking suck  When you sit there  And watch some dumb fucking  Thing that's been done  A thousand times  With just different actors  Yuck  I've had it  True Grit  Apollo  I thought that was okay  It was good  But I didn't love it  Who's in that one?  What?  True Grit was fucking Jeff  No  True Grit was really good  The girl was like it  The girl was really good  Took me out of the movie 
[01:28:30]  So I stopped that one too  I had a shitty copy  Some asshole that  Oh  But I got a pretty good  Oh  Maybe I shouldn't talk about this  But at least I don't pass them on  Until there's like  Other people around here  Apollo 18  No reviews yet  What is Apollo 18 about?  It's about the theater  It's  They go up on the last Apollo mission  And they get  There's like a monster on the moon  A monster on the moon?  Yeah  It's a moon monster  It's like a fake true story  The Cove 
[01:29:00]  Fake true story  Yeah  The Cove was good  Yeah  Oh  Yeah  About the dolphins  Yeah the poor little dolphins  That was a good comedy  And  People are saying  The Zookeeper  Where would The Zookeeper  Fall as far as  All the comedies  That came out this summer?  Now you got  Horrible Bosses  The Change Up  Bridesmaids  Hangover 2  And Zookeeper  Where would people  Put Zookeeper?  That's your top 5 comedies  This summer  Very low  Apparently  13% 
[01:29:30]  Although 47%  Of the audience liked it  You know what  I didn't even see Zookeeper  I'm going to put it  Below Bridesmaids  Wow  Even though I didn't see it  That's harsh  Gotta  Although Bridesmaids  Was very well received  Except for you  Did you like Bridesmaids?  Yeah I thought it was right  It wasn't like my favorite movie  Of all time  But I didn't think it was bad  What was your favorite comedy  Of the summer Sam?  Bad Teacher  I know you liked that one  I saw a tweet about that  Bad Teacher was  Sam loved Bad Teacher  Loved it  What did you like about it Sam?  Nothing 
[01:30:00]  It was the worst comedy  Of the year  Definitely  It was absolutely  Much worse than Bridesmaids  Why was it a bad movie?  Well because  It didn't make any sense  Nothing could have  Actually happened  In any reality  And most of  But she was throwing  Balls at the kids  In the dodgeball game  No I understand  That she was not  A good teacher  That was pretty outrageous  If you're gonna show  Bad Teacher  You gotta throw  Fucking balls at kids  I mean but the whole thing  Would have been  Okay you're fired  For the things that you do  And they wouldn't  Have done that movie 
[01:30:30]  She wouldn't have gotten  The opportunity  To do any of it  Because  Was she having sex  With the kids?  No she had no sex  Why would you have a movie  Called Bad Teacher  And there's no  Like her coming on  To the children  No  No sex with kids  Fuck Hollywood  I just watched the trailer  Without any sound though  For Apollo 18  Yeah  It looks like  Blair Witch Project  On the moon  Exactly  Oh really?  It looks like  Blair Witch on the moon  And another thing  It's gonna do  By the way  Is completely  Re-energize 
[01:31:00]  People that say  We never went to the moon  Oh good  Because it looks  Really good  Like it looks like  They're on the fucking moon  It does  Let me see  So there could be  Another one of these  A bunch of people  Are gonna be like  Look  They were able to  Do you don't think  They were able to do that  With technology back then?  One of the footprints  Looks like a dinosaur  Like it's  It's like  That's the monster  Yeah yeah  That could be the monster  But it does look like  Blair Witch Project  On the moon  Sam doesn't turn the screen enough  I'm complaining  No Sam is very bad  At turning the screen  I know but it's not  You have to turn it better  Or move over a little bit 
[01:31:30]  We're very important  Yeah  We have to see it  This isn't  This isn't the shit hour  Oh I saw it already  The following  Oh  Oh  Is it recovered  It's just creepy  December 74  It's creepy to think  About being lost  On the moon  This  This is like  Apollo 18  This is like  The other one  Just play  Can you pause this  I need Anthony's knowledge  Apollo 18 
[01:32:00]  What's that  There wasn't  An Apollo 18  There never was  An Apollo 18  No  When did they stop  There was supposed to be  They stopped  At Apollo 17  Oh really  That's what they want you to think  So this is the next one  Until they met the moon monster  Yeah  They  Oh the moon monster  What's the deal with this movie  They're making believe  That we secretly  Did Apollo 18  There was a secret mission  Yes  Okay  To go to the moon  To find something out  Okay  And  All hell broke loose  And now they're  Releasing the video  That's what happened  Yeah now they're releasing 
[01:32:30]  All the shit from 1970  I'm sorry  Mind me at Cloverfield  Cloverfield has set it up  That way too  Recovered footage  Don't get me started  With that Cloverfield  That should have been  A great movie  I enjoyed it  They fucked up  With that shaky camera shit  That didn't bother me  A lot of people  Got nauseous though  What number was  Apollo  What number was  The Apollo  That linked up  With the Soyuz  That was 64  Oh  I think that's incorrect  Apollo 9.2  Was that 17  Or did 17  Go to the moon 
[01:33:00]  Yeah Apollo 3  Apollo 3  Nice  I'll figure this out  Alright let's hit the trailer  Apollo Candy  They were given  A classified mission  These were the words  Up on the ridge  10 o'clock  Uh huh  It's a Russian helmet  They're now following  What appear to be  Tracks made by  A possible Soviet cosmos  But they weren't  Given the truth  Why didn't we know  About this  DOD has clear signals  On both transmitters 
[01:33:30]  Your mission is complete  Nice  This is discover  It is good moon footage  What the hell was that  Yeah it does look good  What you were  Never meant to see  To see  Something else out here  Something wrong  Set inside my suit  I can't get around  I can't get around  I can't get around  I can't get around  I can't get around  I can't get around  I can't get around  I can't get around  I can't get around  I can't get around  Oh  There's a monster in his helmet  How'd he get in there  Come on  Can't put it in there  What the hell are you doing  He put creatures  In our bodies  Houston this is liberty  Do you read me 
[01:34:00]  God  Oh they trashed their moon buggy  I can't see you  God  It's like alien  No it's more like  Blair Witchy  Oh yeah  Oh wait  That guy just got dragged off  Somewhere  Into the dark side of the moon  That looks fucking good  I'll see it  Hopefully  I like it  Can we ask Howard  If he's got a screen or that  Sam  Make a list  Please  Yeah  Because I want to  Kind of see that  Now that he's a pirate  We need movies  Badly  If he's going to be  Willy nilly 
[01:34:30]  With his copies  We want  We want the Apollo 18  Definitely  I want Inception  For the hell of it  Inception  If Howard's got movies  That he's just fucking  Giving to people  Then why pay for it  Right  I saw  Come attraction  Of a great movie  Last night  Called Women Aren't Funny  What's happening with that  Six weeks away baby  How long are you fucking  To be done  Oh good  How do you know  It's six weeks  Because that's how long  It takes to do sound 
[01:35:00]  And the sound  That's great  Don't give Howard a copy  Is he going to be in theaters  I don't know  Yeah  Yeah  Anthony's  Hey  Hey that's not a bad place  To start  Yeah  Why don't you have the premiere  Why don't you have the premiere  At Ants  That would be fun  Huh  Because I don't want people  Drunk  I want people to watch it  True  And there's going to be  An age limit  But Apollo Soyuz  Was Apollo 18  Oh  I thought so  Yes  Apollo 18 was the one  With the monster  Yeah but see 
[01:35:30]  I think they said  It was going to be  An Apollo Soyuz thing  I bet that comes up  In the movie  But they actually didn't  They went all the way  To the fucking moon  See Apollo 18  Was supposed to go to the moon  And they had it all built  And everything  But then they  Cut the program  So they just used it  As like some kind of  A look at us  With the Soviets  And they linked up  With the Soyuz  Spacecraft  And they had like  Some fucking  You know  Tang and vodka  Some bubblies  Up there  We brought the tang  They brought the vodka  So that's what  That's what happened there  I think that's why 
[01:36:00]  They found a Russian helmet  On the moon  Right  So I guess  It was supposed to be  Something with the Russians  And the moon  And I have no idea  But yeah okay  Was that part of Skylab  No no  Skylab came after  The Apollo program  It did  That was silly  Skylab  I didn't realize  Skylab was a piece of shit  It's like a movie  I'm writing  Where they meet monsters  But it's on Jupiter  Yeah  Same movie  Yeah no it's not  Because Jupiter  They're big monsters  That's actually 2001 
[01:36:30]  Isn't it  2001 A Space Odyssey  Was Jupiter  2011  Going to Jupiter  No more movies  I like space movies  I liked the movie Moon  Oh yeah  See if Howard  See if Howard's got Moon  That was good  Again Moon is at Best Buy  I don't want to pay for them  If Howard's giving these out  And I like actually  Why pay for movies  If Howard Stern's got them  I like actually looking  In the upper right hand corner  Of the movie  At any given time  And seeing H Stern  And seeing H Stern there  So you know 
[01:37:00]  Where you go for your movies  It's like subliminal advertising  Right  That he's doing  Robin  Can we have Troy  Knock on the door  I know he would do this  In a second  Yeah and he's got friends  Over there  So he may have  A little connection  That I don't have  Say could we get  I want Apollo 18 now  So if he  He probably has that  If he could do that  He's got to have that  Yeah  Troy  Come in  And tell the  We want Apollo 18  Before he puts it online  For everybody else  Yeah  Because it's not special  If it's going to be online  Oh if it's there  For millions of people

[01:48:30]  Even for people that aren't into golf  Tiger Woods is just uh  I don't know  I think he's coming across  Like a complete fucking douche bag  At this point  What did he do?  Oh by firing  Everything he's done  But I mean  The latest one was  Firing Steve Williams  Who was a very fucking loyal guy  He would push spectators  Throw them down the hill  Take their cameras  Throw them in the fucking water  So he's a jerk off basically  Yeah  Protecting his  You know  His guy  And you know  Supposedly  He kept his 
[01:49:00]  He kept his mouth shut  During all those  Uh  Liaisons  Uh  He was having  And out of nowhere  So Steve Williams says  You know  Tiger  Fired him  Well but also too  The guy went  But Steve Williams  For fucking uh  Uh  What's his name  Why Tiger was  What  What is his name  Fucking  The one who just won yesterday  Scott  What's his fucking name  Okay good  Adam Scott  Adam Scott  So  But Tiger's been  Like not playing well  Or at all  For the last 18 months  So Steve Williams goes to 
[01:49:30]  Uh  Tiger  Hey  Can I  Caddy for Adam Scott  You know  In the US Open  I think was the first tournament  I don't know which one it was  And basically Steve Williams saying  You know  A  I'm just sitting around  Doing nothing  And B  I want to keep my skills  Because I'm  You know  Caddies do have some skills  They're not hitting  Hitting the ball for the guy  Obviously  But you know  Just trying to keep  Their fucking skills  Uh  So Steve Williams  Gets fired by Tiger Woods  It's a big story  Tiger's  Tiger's like  You know  I had to move on  And Steve Williams  Like what the fuck  Came out of left field 
[01:50:00]  So now they don't like  Each other all  Or Steve Williams  Doesn't like Tiger at all  So then  Uh  Fast forward  Uh  Tiger is playing  His first tournament  In a while  And Steve Williams  Is carrying the bag  For Adam Scott  And Adam Scott  Wins the tournament  It's a great story  It's a great sports story  Yeah  Well  Everybody wanted  Adam Scott to win  They really wanted  Steve Williams to win  Well they were cheering  I feel bad for Adam Scott  Because basically  People today are saying  Steve Williams  Won this tournament  I mean  Yeah yeah  I know  That's pretty much  What they're saying  Like even Rich 
[01:50:30]  Uh  Who's the guy  Uh  Adam  Well no Adam Scott  He was number two  In the world  Like four years ago  And I go  I don't know how  He's only won a couple  He's won eight tournaments  All together  But one year  Steve Williams sounds like  A dick though  No he's doing  No he's not  Taking people's cameras  Like what the fuck is he  Because you're not  Supposed to be shooting  During a golf tournament  He didn't do it all the time  But he had some  He had some incidents  It's not because  He just wanted to be  Photographed  Those clicks  Could throw off  Yeah yeah  And make you miss it  And that's a hundred thousand  No not Al  I get it  I'm kind of with Jimmy  He's an aggressive guy 
[01:51:00]  He's a dick  But there's  You know you heard  One story about him  In the office  Nah you gotta kick a ball  You football  Fucking basketball players  They have to watch  Them fucking wave sticks  Behind the basket  But that's what  They're trained to do  Exactly  So golfers should  Stop meeting it  Quiet  What do they do  If a bird chirps  Shoot it  Fuck them  Oh  He's gonna make that  Fucking faggot  Hit the ball  I've been around golf  My whole life  Jimmy's kind of right 
[01:51:30]  No he's not  They are that fucking pussy  Hit the fucking ball  He's kind of right  So you kick a field goal  You then  They won't make  Fucking noises  Yeah  Throughout your field goal  Life and history  That's what you've dealt with  So maybe  You didn't deal with people  Heckling when you're  Going to fucking  Golfers should be retrained  It's got more concentration  It does not  Hit the ball  It's this gentleman's game  Hit the ball  In the fucking hole  Just fucking yell  Jimmy just turned me on this  He's right  I know he is  I mean maybe heckling  Is ridiculous  Screaming in your face  As you're trying to make 
[01:52:00]  A 12 foot putt  But a dumb camera  Going off or something  I think Jimmy's right  Or the announcers  Have to  They have to whisper  The whole time  If you heard someone  Talking in the background  While you're playing golf  It's not gonna  Every other sport  Is noisy  That's why it's not a sport  Yeah they all have  To deal with noise  I don't think tennis is as noisy  Is it  They don't tell them  Oh shush  Dude you got a football game  The quarterback can't even  Call fucking signals  Because the crowd's so loud  You're comparing  Fucking apples to apples  But why 
[01:52:30]  Answer this  Because you play a lot of golf  Why does a golfer  Have to have complete  Concentration and silence  And other sports don't  Because there's more  Concentration than  I don't think so  Yeah there is  How  Because one  A second baseman  Might not have a ball  Hit to him the whole  Fucking game  So what does he care  How about a batter  Who has a ball  Being thrown  Ninety three miles an hour  Yeah  And dipping  And dropping  Right  And you got the whole crowd  With those thunder sticks  Oh please  It's a dumb argument  No it's not  It is 
[01:53:00]  It really makes perfect sense  How come when people  Are taking tests  In school or college  Or everybody  No one's sitting there  Yelling  Because you have to  Because you don't yell  In class at all  Why not  Because you've got to  Concentrate  No but the argument  Would be  Hold on  You can't concentrate  When people  Are yelling at you  How come baseball players  Can concentrate  You have to concentrate  In every sport  That's Jimmy's point  Of a movie  How come when people  Are doing a movie  Because there's no yelling  On the set of any movie  There is yelling  On the set of every sport  But golf  Basketball free throw  Shh  Shh 
[01:53:30]  Shh  All right  Quietly  All right  Here's the deal  This is what we'll do  When you start playing golf  I don't want to play golf  It stinks  Well how do you know  You've never played it  Exactly  Why would I  I never fucking put my dick  In a toaster oven either  But I know that's not fun  Shh  Dick in a toaster oven  Guess again  I just hate the way  They all have to shush  That fucking douche bag  Caddy running over  Minding everybody's business  They all do it  I think Jimmy's right  Fuck damn  Call security  Or they step away from a putt  Because someone will yell  In the gallery  Yeah  You know 
[01:54:00]  Because you're Tate  Then don't let people  Stand there  That putt could be worth  A fucking hundred  Two hundred thousand dollars  So what  You don't have to concentrate  A focus when you're on  The foul line  And trying to make  A free throw  In a fucking championship game  You're trying to get  The ball in the hole  That free throw  That free throw  That free throw  The free throw  Right  Listen to me  You've done it  Well  When you speak properly  I will  The basket  Listen  The basket's always the same height  The foul line is always the same distance  Yes  It's always the same 
[01:54:30]  Free throw  So you can do that in your sleep  It's never the same  It's never  It's a ball  And there's a hole  It's always the same  It's always the same  It's always the same  In basketball  You're on the green  You're like  Okay  When you finally figure out  What the read is on  And let's say  It's going to break  From right to left to foot  How is a guy yelling  At that point  Going to bother you  When you've  Got it down  Yeah  Now all you have to do  Is just make the stroke  I'm with Jimmy  I think Jimmy turned me on  And a fucking baseball  That's how we play  Every time you putt  I'm going to scream  But a baseball player  That's not going to make  A difference with you 
[01:55:00]  I'm not saying  Distracting  But I'm saying  These guys are so  Fucking used to  Dead silence  It's annoying  I can see  That's how it is  Here's why it is  That's how you're taught play  That's how you're taught  How about this  Tough shit  If you can make  $200,000 for sinking a putt  You should be able to make it  With a camera clicking  Right  If you lose $200,000  Because a camera clicked  You didn't deserve $200,000  I think it's  I think  To answer Jimmy's question  Because someone's reminding me  Thank you Ace  Also tennis is like this 
[01:55:30]  That's right  Yeah  So you got tennis and golf  Okay  Are the two sports basically  Tennis yeah  And they're the hoity-toity sports  Right  Rich people  Everyone knows that  It's the rich people's sports  Yeah  Please be quiet  Right  Fuck that  You should be able to hit a tennis ball  While people are yelling and screaming  Let's go with the savage sports  Let's act like savages  Not savages  But just the other sports  That are not fucking considered  Rich people's sports  I think there's something going on  I think Jimmy has opened my eyes today  Yeah  Why can't you make a serve 
[01:56:00]  With people yelling  Why?  You've done it a million times  In your life  I'm not yelling  How about just conversation even  And to go with Rich's point  Because he said  A free throw is the same every time  A serve more or less  Is the same thing every time  More or less  No because there's wind  And there's not in baseball  I didn't say  I didn't say  And there's wind  When there's free throws being shot  No there isn't  Yeah because a lot of people are yelling  And that creates a lot of hot air and stuff  Hot air  You're full of hot air  Anyway Steve Williams  We got some audio 
[01:56:30]  Of Steve Williams  After Adam Scott won the tournament  Remember it was Adam Scott  Not Steve Williams  Not Steve Williams  Don't be confused  As Tiger came in like 32nd place  And just floundered around the golf course  His caddie that he just fired  Is carrying the bag for the guy  That wins the tournament  And what people find really funny  Is that Steve Williams  Officially made more money  Than Tiger Woods  This past week  As far as the golf part  Of his career goes  I think Tiger  Made about 58,000  And Steve Williams 
[01:57:00]  Made anywhere from 80 to 100  I'll tell you Stevie  That's  You know  Somebody has won seven times  Here  I think you've got eight flags now  Is that right?  Hey I've got to tell you David  I've been a caddie for 33 years  And that's the best week of my life  And I'm not joking  I'm never ever going to remember  Forget that week  The people here this week  Have been absolutely unbelievable  And all the support  He's saying the best week of his life  Of his life  And he carried the bag for Tiger  When Tiger  Won the Open to Masters  Oh yeah 
[01:57:30]  He was there for all of the glory  How many majors did he carry for Tiger?  Not all of his majors, right?  Rich?  Because you had the walrus mustache guy for a while  I hope Adam Scott fires him this week  That'd be really funny  You've got to think Adam Scott was happy to a point  But it was like  13  Thank you Sam  From the people back in New Zealand  Including my family  That's the greatest week of my life  How is this different? 
[01:58:00]  You know  I mean  You play  You count it for the best player in the world  Without question  You've seen some of the greatest golf that's ever played  You know  To come out  And to get on with a youngster  Like this  You know  It has to be a heck of a change  But  I mean  You seem to be in your element still  You know  With somebody maybe  You know  Not so much at the start of their career  Could you pause that?  They're talking to a caddy by the way  Not the guy that won the tournament  Right  This is just amazing  And of course he's in element  He's carrying a bag for someone else  Lug the bag 
[01:58:30]  How fucking hard is that?  Lug the bag  How skilled do you have to be?  Strong  I was a caddy for 10 plus years  That long?  Easily  Yeah  I started at 12  So about 10 years  Maybe 11  Wow  Did you ever caddy for a bag or vans?  Yes I did  He was a good putter  Did you do two bags at a time?  Oh fuck yeah  That's why I have a horrible back now  Holy fuck  At what course?  Like up and down hills?  Fuck yeah  Huntington Crescent Club  When my body was still growing 
[01:59:00]  I was carrying 100 pounds of bags  Around the course  It hasn't stopped  Thank you sir  I don't know what that means but  Alright  I'm getting back to the gym  Cunt  Now look  Your body is great  Now I'm folding my arms  Fuck  No there's a  I mean  When you figure out how to  You know  Read putts  And when you could club golfers  It's very valuable  Hold on  Let me read putts  He's relaxed 
[01:59:30]  With his arms on the table  I'm with the rich  Yeah  But I don't know how much  Oh putts  I don't know how much  How important a caddy is in the PGA  I have no idea  Well because they know the course  They know  But the golfers know the course too  A caddy will go out before the round  See pin placements  See breaks  See all the fucking  Oh big deal  What do you think I should do  Hit the ball in the hole  Thanks a million  No shit Sherlock  I think you just 
[02:00:00]  I was listening to a tournament last night  Reno Tahoe  They had the caddies and the players mic  And the fucking caddies were saying stuff  That you know  You're going  This is really helping the dude  But I'm thinking the golfer knows all that  Listen I played at Beth  I mean where I was at  At a dumb country club  Where you know  Some of the guys actually were scratched though  For that course  Uh huh  I felt like I was helping them out  I played with a caddy at Bethpage  And he was drinking  And I hit a ball  And he couldn't find it  I go you fucking drunk  Your job is to keep your eye on the fucking ball 
[02:00:30]  That's all you have to do  Right  That's all you have to do  Fucking  You know it's going to cost me two strokes  You fucking idiot  Right  Yeah  And there was no money on the line  And I was pissed  But again  That's what a caddy's job is  Watch the ball  And point  Like a fucking beagle  I'm going to take this call  Because speaking of watching the ball  Tony in Brooklyn  Hey  Oh  I actually live in Huntington  But did you ever caddy for Clarky?  Clark Gillies 
[02:01:00]  Of course I did  Many many times  Clark Gillies  Who's a regular at FH Riley's  In the heart of Huntington Village  400 New York Avenue  He loves my brother's place  We all caddied for him  And it was a nightmare  Because this fucking guy  Hit the ball so fucking hard  So fucking far  And so fucking out of the way  It was impossible  To know where his ball was  Was he a good golfer?  He  Yeah  You know what  He was under a 10 handicap at the time  I believe  Oh he's just a guy from Long Island?  He's not a famous guy or something? 
[02:01:30]  I don't know  He's actually the fucking guy  Yeah  This guy just wants to know  He's from Jersey  Well who the fuck is Clark Gillies?  But doesn't your mind figure shit out  Like if a guy's calling up  Who I don't know  And he's asking about a guy named Clark Gillies  That he has to be famous?  No  Because this guy could have belonged to your club  And played your club  And used to play with Clark Gillies  And everybody at the club knows Clark Gillies  Is a fucking  I'll give you that one a little bit  But  He's a legendary Islander  Oh Clark  I quit my first day caddy 
[02:02:00]  And the guy threw the club  It bounced and hit me  And I dropped his bag  And said I quit  That was it  I wanted to quit anyhow  It was too hard  Let me tell you  That's real work right?  You're bringing back memories  Because I had a paper route  Where I was making  Maybe 20 bucks a week  And then  In one day  I was bringing home  At least 20 to 40 bucks  You know  Per day at the golf course  And those fucking members  Every once in a while  Would throw that club  And you'd be like  And they would look at you like 
[02:02:30]  Well are you going to fetch it?  And then  In your mind  You're like  I know I shouldn't be  Fetching this asshole's club  But the money's too god damn good  My friend had a paper route  He was going on vacation  Yeah  And I was delivering them  You know for the week  And he gave me the list  Of where they go  So I lost the list  So the first  The second  You know  At first I had the list  Then the second  I didn't have the list  So I just delivered on memory  And then the third  Oh great  The third, fourth and fifth day  I dropped the fucking papers  In the sewer  What about collection day though? 
[02:03:00]  I didn't have to collect  I was just delivered  He paid me  And he paid me  That's hilarious  Was he mad?  Yeah he was fucking furious  Everybody screaming  You didn't even get your papers  Holy shit  I gotta tell you a story  And I apologize  But I had a penny saver route  Remember the penny saver 
[02:03:30]  On Long Island?  So this is like a free  Who gives a fuck thing  What was it?  Like coupons and stuff?  I don't even remember anymore  Maybe some news in there  There was no subscription  For this  You just had to  You know  Deliver it to all the houses  And we realized after a while  Like  A. No one's checking on our work  And B. No one gives a fuck  About the penny saver  So we did the exact same thing  Dump them in the sewer  But the penny saver route  That was hundreds of houses  Like a paper route  Maybe you had a couple dozen  I don't know about  Right?  But it was hundreds 
[02:04:00]  So after a while  We're like  Oh well let's  We'll deliver some  In case someone  Like checks out the route  And then the rest  Have to go in a dumpster  But then  Brian  Brian McCormick  My friend  He had a route too  Yeah  Right?  And this is  We're in  Eighth and ninth grade  So we would make him  Collect money  In advance  Or up front  He had his book  And they'd rip out a thing  And we'd go and buy pot  Or cut school  He owed the Courier News  $1,200  In ninth grade 
[02:04:30]  In ninth grade  And they'd let them  Go on and on  And he was a fucking  We'd come on Brian  Go collect  We need money to get high  Holy shit  Paper route sucked  I hate it  I had a double route  And I remember  There was this one  Big fat old lady  Who never had the money  And every time  I'd go to collect  She'd go  Could you come back  Saturday  Saturday  And there was  One of my dad's friends  Who was married to the lady  And I always thought 
[02:05:00]  That she kind of  Wanted to bang me  Like I would always  Look at her ass and stuff  She turned me on a lot  She was an older lady  We were just talking  About Don Mattingly  She was a Yankee fan  I'm with you man  You would collect the money  And you would get some  You know  Some cool vibes  Yeah you would  And you knew  Who was going to tip you  And who sucked  That lady sucked  Come back Saturday  Didn't you have to pay  For your papers too  So if they didn't pay you  You were fucked  Out of your money  I don't remember  I'm not Brian  I beg you remember  Oh yeah  Well that's why  No 
[02:05:30]  That means he had to  Pay for his papers  And then you  You get the money  Back when they pay you  I think that's how  It used to work  No  Yeah  Do you remember it  No I never had  You never had a paper out  Fuck that noise  Alright here's the rest  Of Stevie Williams  Steve Williams  Who won the tournament  Over the weekend  I guess Adam Scott  Was carrying his bag  I think  I don't know  I think they switched  Roles or something  The start of their career  But more of somebody  That you can shape  You know  There's a lot of  Expectations today  I'd be lying  If I said I wasn't  A little nervous 
[02:06:00]  Obviously Adam  Was leading the tournament  And there's a lot  Being said this week  And it's an incredible  Feeling to back it up  I always back myself  Just like I do  When I go racing  I'm a great front runner  When I go racing  And I feel like  I'm a good front runner  I'm cadding  So I have  Great belief in myself  But honestly  That's the best week  Of my life  I caddied for 33 years  145 wins now  And that's the best  Win I've ever had  And the reason  It's the best win  He ever had  As a caddie  Is because he felt  Like Tiger  Fucked him over  It's a great story 
[02:06:30]  He's really  I don't know  Who's right here  But  He's really bashing him  If you feel like  He got fucked over  And then you  You carry the bag  For the guy  That wins the tournament  While your old boss  Is in 32nd place  That's a great  Fucking feeling  Man  Right  It would be like  After we left K-Rock  If the day we had left  There was a bomb  That went off  In the building  Exactly  That would be  The best day of our life  Right  As long as they didn't  Take out Jody  Who's Jody  Oh  I liked Jody  Jimmy quit  Jody got married 
[02:07:00]  Her house burnt down  And we  Oh she was nice  Yeah yeah  We did a little  Something something for her  Yeah I showed her  A picture of my dick  Yep  Did you guys have  A live event  That I wasn't invited  To recently  I read online  Oh yeah  Oh was it a birthday party  Oh no  That wasn't us  Why would we invite you  It was like a live event  Do you invite us  To your live events  Yes  Exactly  To be on the stage  Would you  Every time  Every time  Every time  Alright  Let me say hi to Footer  Footer 
[02:07:30]  Yo good morning boys  Hey  Hey  You kind of hit on it  A little bit  They're interviewing  The fucking caddy  I mean  If there was a big  Home run hit  To win the game  Did they pull out  The back boy  And then like  Interview the back boy  And talk to him about it  I gotta tell you this  I've been watching golf  My entire fucking life  I don't ever remember  A time where they  Interviewed a caddy  They must have  Tiger's caddy  Yeah  Story I guess  Yeah  I'm not a golf guy  And I'm sitting there  With him going  What the fuck  Is going on  Who gives a shit  Well it's 
[02:08:00]  The biggest news  In golf  This when he got fired  It was a really good story  And as he's walking around  Yesterday  The gallery was cheering  Steve Williams name  Not Adam Scott  But here's the thing  I don't understand  Everybody loves Tiger  But they love  Hate him  Because they wanted  To see this guy  Fucking win  You know  There's a lot of things  You don't understand  So don't start up  Look at  You're the  Ah  Shit  Here's the  Here's the difference  You're the caller  Okay  So here's  Back to work  Did you see Tiger's 
[02:08:30]  New caddy  He looks like  He's a member  Of the geek squad  And has the  Whitest legs ever  And they were just  Making fun of  His horrible white legs  What  Was he a club caddy  Or was that  Tiger's best friend  Tiger picked the  Worst guy to be his caddy  If he's trying  To rebuild his image  Would you quit  Would you quit radio  If Tiger said caddy  For me  Not Tiger  Because I don't think  He's  I would have  Back in those chicks  If Rory McIlroy  McIlroy 
[02:09:00]  I had visions of  Taking my caddy career  To the next level  I did  The caddy for Obama  Well you know  I did though  I mean  I didn't know  This radio thing  Was going to work out  I'm like  You know what  I think I might be able  To get into some  Local tournaments  And you never know  Winning that caddy tournament  That's what's important  There was  There's a comic  That's a caddy  That's getting there  There was a point  Where there was  About five of us  That were picked  All the time  Because we knew  How to read the  Fucking greens  And club these guys  And they were  They were playing  For a lot of  Fucking money  It was nerve wracking 
[02:09:30]  And I'm only  15-16  Going holy shit  This guy's  Depending on me  To read some putts  To make some cash today  Alright well you just  Answered his question  What does a caddy do  Read the greens  And they depend on you  Well on my  On the level I was at  That's where  I don't think  These guys are reading  The greens for Tiger Woods  And Adam Scott  And the rest of them  I really don't believe that  But when you play  The course  Every  When you walk  The course every day  For in my case  Twice a day  You really understand  Some of the breaks  In these greens  That you just can't see  With the naked eye  And the fucking lies 
[02:10:00]  On the course  And the way  The fucking ball  Hit off the hill  And kicked left  Or kicked right  There were putts  Where 9 out of 10 golfers  Would go  That breaks right to left  And then you had to  Have the balls to go  I'm telling you  It's left to right  That's what I'm talking about  Yeah  And when it goes  Left to right  And he makes it  Guess who makes  A few bucks that day  Yeah because they made  A lot of fucking money  Gambling right  Yeah there was also  An asshole  His name was  Mr. Frogger  I think  And I was kind of  A cocky caddy  Coming up a little bit 
[02:10:30]  And I didn't know  Those weird breaks  Where it goes  Right to left  But it looks  Left to right  And he would go  Caddy  Which way does this break  And I go  Right to left  Obviously  So he would  He would fucking  Putt it exactly  How I told him  Knowing that it  Went the other way  And then look at me  And go nice try  And walk off the green  I'm like what a  Fucking asshole  He purposely missed  The putt just to be  A dick to me  Because he knew  The whole time  Went left to right  Because he saw  A bright eyed kid  You know feeling  Good about himself 
[02:11:00]  At 14 15  I told some guy  To fuck off  Yesterday on the course  Pretty much  What did he do  I was playing by myself  And I joined some guy  And he was walking  And I'm driving  I wasn't walking  This fucking course  So I'm driving  So there's one hole  That goes to the next hole  Right  He just putted  It was a long walk  To the next hole  And he goes taxi  And then  When I pull around  And I walk  Taxi?  As he walks towards my cart  I go  What does that mean  Taxi?  Like is that some kind of thing  When you're putting  I don't know  He goes no  I need a ride  Right  So he gets 
[02:11:30]  So then like four holes later  He goes taxi  I go I'm not your fucking cab  Taxi driver  I go if you want a ride  Ask for a fucking ride  You don't go fucking  If I'm your taxi  Then you're going to start  Paying me to drive you  To the hole  And I told this  Oh man I'm not your fucking cab  I didn't like him  He had a bad toupee  He was playing golf by himself  If you have a bad toupee  Why would you wear  When you're playing golf  By yourself  Who the fuck  Is going to jump out  Of the woods  And go  You know what I mean  Maybe he didn't want  To get sunburned on his head  Yeah he's going to have  A hat in the car  Fucking asshole 
[02:12:00]  In his fucking cab  I fucking hate toupees  It's enraging  A toop  We gotta go listen to some music  Oh yes we are  Yes  Did we do everything  We needed to do over here  Yeah  You know what  We didn't talk about it  Which I'm kind of bummed about  What  It's a huge story  And I was following your tweets  I know  The uh  We lost some fucking  Brave men over the weekend  We haven't even mentioned it yet  Oh god that's a bitch man  That whole thing  I don't know  And I'm no expert  But it looks like  Some shit was  Yeah 
[02:12:30]  I'm a little shoddy over there  Navy SEALs too huh  Yeah  Team 6 guys  20 Team 6 guys I think  30 fucking Americans  Eight Afghanis  And yeah they got nailed with an RPG  By the Taliban  Yeah  Do you say Tala or Taliban  I say Taliban  Tala  Tala  Tala  Like talcum  Talcum powder  Like talcum powder  Only really mean  Someone's saying that they just knew  That thing was coming  Someone tipped them off man  Yeah  That's what's coming up today  Yeah 
[02:13:00]  Probably one of the Afghanis  Tipped them off  Yeah why are we letting fucking  It's depressing when we lose  You know guys over there obviously  Obviously  I mean  Jesus Christ  This guy's blue today  I mean what the fuck  But uh  What's your take on it though  I don't know  What did we do wrong  It just  Well it  I guess some army  Rangers were in trouble  They were uh  Getting  Some fire laid down on them  And they sent in  A Chinook helicopter  With these 
[02:13:30]  38 guys on there  And it just seemed like  The area was a little  Too involved  To  Bring in a fucking  Chinook  Like those  Without any other  Support  You know you should just  Like I said  I don't know what's going on  Over there  I'm no military advisor  But  From shit I have learned  Over the years  It seems like  You should take your resources  Like your assault helicopters  Go in there  And fucking  Clear an area out  Before you bring an old 
[02:14:00]  Uh  Chinook helicopter  That's just full of guys  It's like bringing a bus in  Pretty much like you just  Brought a bus  Into the area  Without first  Really clearing the shit  What do you know  About the Chinook  Those things  They're old helicopters  They've been around  Since the NOM  Right  Um  They're not really  Uh  Gun ships  I mean some of them  Could be made  Uh  Into pretty formidable  Gunships  But this wasn't one  It was a transport  They were transporting  Uh  Troops  Into an area  That was hot 
[02:14:30]  And uh  It seems like  They didn't  Clear the area  Out enough  Now if these rangers  Were in imminent danger  And they had to get  More men on the ground  That's one thing  But you'd think  They'd  Use some  Uh  Air resources  First  Kind of blast out  The area  Get a good look  Before they bring in  You know  A pretty big  Uh  Un  Un  Not unarmed  Uh  Helicopter  But  Not the best  It's not the best 
[02:15:00]  Helicopter  To bring it  Into a hot area  They're  They're big  They're slow  They're easy  Targets  Yeah  Now they're saying  Like I said  Someone tipped them off  Fuck  Yeah  That's  That's  That sucks  But  You know  That's war  So they say  Eh  Wow  Hate  Hate  Hate  Hate  Hate  When that  Happens  It's kind of  Like  Yeah  You just know  People are  Fucking  Feeling bad  Poor  Fuckers  That's gotta 
[02:15:30]  Suck  Rotors  They don't  They don't  Take to hitting  The ground  Well either  Wow  Let's see  Helicopters crash  It's just a wreck  Jesus Christ  Sometimes it looks  Like oh  It's coming down  Kind of soft  And then it  Tips over  Slowly  And just  Rips itself  Apart  Right  God  Archaic  Whirlybird  Jesus Christ  Come up with  Something better  And we didn't get to  Tony Bruno's  In trouble for calling  The Giants  Pitcher there  An illegal alien  On Twitter  Oh yeah 
[02:16:00]  Enough  It's just stupid  Language  Gives a fuck  Is he  What  Is he illegal  I don't know  I just decided  To read that headline  I don't know  Anything about that story  I was just reading  Headlines  If you want to know  The truth on that one  Here's to fucking  Scam  How they want to  Double  They're fucking  So smart  And the governors  And the port authority  Okay we'll raise  We'll raise the tunnel toll  By four or six dollars  And everybody's going to be  Outraged  When they only really want  To raise it by two 
[02:16:30]  And the people will go  Oh well they're only  Raising the two  Not the six  During the break actually  Yeah yeah yeah  It wasn't on the air  It's just a fucking  The two governors  Are signing off  They're not signing off  They're against it  So they look good  It's a scam  Between all of these  Motherfuckers  I'm out of my mind  About this shit  Yeah  Because I don't know  How people are  Fucking paying their  Bills anymore  If this thing goes up  To 15 is what  They're sort of saying  I mean if you do  The math  That's 75 bucks a week  For someone to  Commute into the city  To work  Not counting the  New Jersey turnpike 
[02:17:00]  You're paying for  Something for that  And then you're also  Paying for parking  And gas  Like how the fuck  Are people affording this  And how the fuck  Are the politicians  Saying this is okay  Because one  Even if they raise it  Two dollars  That's not okay  It's bait and switch  That's what they're doing  They're trying for four  They're going to get two  Probably like you're saying  But that's not okay either  No it's not  Because they just  And then I have another  EasyPass question  For Norton  Do you have EasyPass yet?  I thought I was going to  Do the application  Oh my god  I just want to know 
[02:17:30]  If I get EasyPass  Are you allowed to use  In every state?  Yeah pretty much every state  The fact that you don't  Have it is just  I'm getting it  But how do you not have it  For years we've been  Telling you to get it  What do you do  How does Bonnie  Travel with you?  I was  You sit on that line  And wait  I was going through  The Lincoln Tunnel  Yesterday around  Three, four in the afternoon  And man  I zipped right through  EasyPass  And I'm looking at  The cash lanes going  These guys are going to be  Here for 40 fucking minutes  Yeah  People like you  People who have  Literally  At this point  I mean my thing is  People should be  Dragged out of the car 
[02:18:00]  And shot  That's not going to happen  Yeah yeah  You should be forced  To take another route  And not even go through  The tunnel  They should route  Everybody without EasyPass  To the GW  Or to the Holland  Or to the Lincoln  Or to one of them  Should be designated  For every fucking idiot  Without EasyPass  Should be forced  Into one area  I'm glad you  And there should be  Sensors too  Because if they discover  That your car's  In an EasyPass lane  Your car just explodes  It just blows up  That's not going to happen  Either like  You know  Here's the problem  Also with the Midtown Tunnel  When you're going back  Out to Long Island  From the exit of the tunnel 
[02:18:30]  To the toll booths  It's not a lot of room  So the fucking dumb cash cunts  Back the entire thing up  Into the tunnel  So I'm sitting there  With the EasyPass  I'm stuck in the traffic  In the tunnel  And then when you come out  You got to work your way  All the way to the left  Where the EasyPass is  And finally zip right through  But you've already  Wasted time in the tunnel  Because some asshole  Has got a fish change  Out of his pocket  And cash  Fucking assholes  Get off the road  I myself 
[02:19:00]  The reason I didn't get  EasyPass  Because I'm tired  Of people getting fired  For technology  I was trying to keep  People working  Okay  Who gives a foot  You know what  How about the people  That work in the EasyPass factory  Exactly  How about the people  Who are late for work  How about the people  Who are late for work  Because they've been  Sitting in line for two hours  Yeah  The EasyPass factory  EasyPass factory  What do they do  The EasyPass factory  They fucking glue together  The plastic pieces  And put the shit inside  How about the guys 
[02:19:30]  That paint the EasyPasses  I love how Chip tags everything  But it sucks  If the toll collectors  Were nicer to me over the years  Then maybe I'd feel  A little bit sorry for them  Fuck those people  Yeah they should be  Burned alive in their booth  Because you're the nicest  Person alive  I am  I really am  You're a nice person  Yeah I just play this part  On the radio  Everyone knows that  Thanks  You don't even get nothing  Yeah here you go  Thanks  Alright  A few people know  That you're nice  Yeah this is just  A part I play on the radio 
[02:20:00]  It's a character  Yeah  So people  So you want people  To believe that  This is your character  Oh yeah  It is  Okay so if I say  People around me  In my inner circles know  If I say what I do  On the radio  Is a character  People won't believe that  Well you gotta act different  When the mics are off  You don't  That's a good point  You're the same fucking dummy  No I'm not  You see how smart I am  On the streets  You're not smart on the streets  I love you  I fucking love you Rich  You know that  I love doing radio with Rich  Where you gonna be Rich  We gotta go to the  Tommy T's

[02:21:30]  It used to be such  A peaceful little town  And there's only one man  Who can catch him  Now don't you worry  I'm gonna send my best man  Down there to help you  In your investigation  But he was busy  Here comes fucking  Ferret face  Whatever  Alright Agent Voss  Someone's out there  Murdering innocent women  I want you to go down there  And assist the local sheriff  You're one of the bad  Get down there and help the sheriff  How could he be a profiler  His vocabulary is so bad  Yeah but no one listens 
[02:22:00]  This summer  The Opie and Anthony show  Presents a comedy  About an idiotic comedian  Pretending to be an FBI agent  So you work a lot of murders before  Now we're doing mainly a lot  On terrorists and terrorist type threats  And stuff like that  But you know back  Back in the day  It was more murder  What are some of the cases  You worked on?  Just you know  Seattle  The Green River  What do you call it?  Look I can't talk a lot about it  I don't get this much in detail  Starring Jim Norton  He just keeps saying profile  Profilers 
[02:22:30]  Other profilers  Profilers  And Rich Voss  Great minds think a lot  I like  Oh my god  The Profiler  Coming to a theater  Nowhere near you  Or anyone else  Thank baby Jesus  The Opie and Anthony show  We're on the air 
[02:23:00]  No one told us  Are you serious?  How did nobody tell us  We're on the radio?  That is so fantastic  That's kind of cool though  We're just shooting the shit  With Led Zeppelin  In the fishbowl  I'm a huge Zeppelin fan  And I'm really excited  To be here  To check them out  Yes  Are you all  What do they hear?  No one knows  Eric?  Anyone?  No one knows  We just started  How bad could it be?  Nobody farted right? 
[02:23:30]  No  Our mics sound weird  It's too loud  Why is Jimmy's mic so loud?  My headphones are  More a little feedback  That's good  I don't know what's going on there  This is like a real 70s rock show  Isn't it?  Yeah  Yeah  Isn't it?  I got to turn down my mic  Complete with feedback  So what's everybody's name?  We met Megan  And we met Lisa right?  Is Lisa the drummer?  Lisa back here  Lisa has a great shirt  It says  I have the biggest dick in the band  Actually they made a misspelling 
[02:24:00]  It really should say  I am the biggest dick in the band  Oh shit  This is too loud  So who plays who  These headphones are killing us  Are you going to turn them down?  Who plays who in the band?  That's John Bottom obviously  So who's Robert Plant?  That would be me  Nice fucking  Yeah  Nice little shorty shorts  Thank you  Yes  Sorry  Two of the gals have very short shorts  And she has like a little butterfly tattoo  Is that what that is?  It's a ladybug 
[02:24:30]  A ladybug?  Yeah  Very  No it's a stupid question  But are you all lesbians?  Is that why  Or is it just the name of the band?  Oh my god  No one's ever asked this  I'm sure that's  Is that the question that they ask?  Because it says Les Zeppelin  So I didn't know if it was  Just because you're women  Or is it a sexual orientation based title?  You're actually the first person  To ever ask that  But since you asked  We felt we'd just play a little game  And you know  It's don't ask don't tell  We don't tell  Okay  But you need to sort of guess  You know by the end of the show  You should pretty much  Be able to figure it out  No one's ever asked you that?  Because it's called Les Zeppelin  So  I know 
[02:25:00]  You know  They usually ask  Are you really Zeppelins?  Now I don't even know  Although  Oh they do  Does everybody ask you that?  Are you actually  It was complete sarcasm  I didn't know  Well I have to know  There's this aisle of lesbos  But I've never been there  I'm going to guess  Yes lesbos  I do live in Astoria though  This is my family's from lesbos  I'm going to guess  Two out of the four are lesbians  That's safe man  That's 50-50  I'm going to guess two out of four  We call ourselves opportunists  No I'm going four for four  Definitely  Wait you really think  It's four for four? 
[02:25:30]  Yeah  I don't know  I think Megan's not sure  Megan's trying to figure it out still  We sometimes change our mind  You know  Within the hour  Because girls do that  Depending on who's in the room  Yeah  Why don't we even talk to you guys?  I don't even  How did this come about?  Does anyone know?  How did we get here?  I know  No I don't mind  And I'm very excited  But I'm trying to figure out  There's a sperm and an egg  Yes  I think  Take it right to the beginning  I think Patrick Munaki booked this  Because I think he's a huge fan  Was your name Shannon? 
[02:26:00]  Yes  My publicist wrote an email  And said the lead singer Shannon  I heard sing  In another project  And she actually wanted to come in today  And she said you were so good  That she wanted to hear you sing  With this band  Oh rock on man  And then I totally blew her off  And didn't get back to her  So she's not here  Good job  This is Rich Voss  He loves Led Zeppelin  I'm Rich  This is Led Zeppelin  What's the fucking deal here?  They might be lezzies  We're not really sure  We are musicians  But they are musicians  We know that  And they love Zeppelin  Yes  We just don't know about the 
[02:26:30]  Lick and Box thing yet  And I can attest  That we were all born female  I think that's pretty safe to say  We were born with all of them  This one definitely  I'm not even going to comment on that  If you had to pick one  We all have invisible dates  We think she's not sure yet  And then your girls for me  No I would have to go with  This one's definitely a lesbian  Okay  This one's in a failed relationship  And this one's on the fence  He's good this guy  He's good  You must be psyched  You do one of those shows  I'm so non-committal 
[02:27:00]  I can't make up my mind  Okay  I want them all  Like a typical singer  You're very good at us  Yeah she's dressed like she wants them all  Yeah you have really  You're too scared to figure me out  That's what it is  What garage are you guys  I mean where do you guys usually play  On the road  Or like clubs and shit  Yeah we do concert halls  We do go on the road  Sometimes we play on the road itself  But usually we just go on a bus on the road  We are playing a couple things  We've got a speaking engagement

Don't try to make it nice now  With a real question  They hate you  I would love fucking  For her  Because I'm married  Just to sing  And watch me  If I can drop a badge  On my stomach  Oh  Well come stand in the front row  Hopefully it's a batch of hot lead  He's not with us every day  You can do whatever you want  In our shows  Just do it on the front row  Where we can see it  He's not a member of our radio show

I'm just fucking  She's cute  I know she's cute  But she's a lesbian  I don't have a shot with her  She's not really talking  I always say  Because you're guys  Why would she waste her time talking to you?  But do you think if she was straight  You'd have a shot with her?  Look at the way your headphones are on your head  You fucking idiot  Just because she's straight  Doesn't mean she's a fucking retarded guy  Be careful

[02:53:30]  Thank you so much.  Really fucking good.  Great bass, and everything was fucking great.  No complaints, huh, Rich?  No, listen, I don't care about the sex.  I like the fucking music, man.  Come to the show.  But they're not going to grind on us. 
[02:54:00]  You guys hear Slesbo.  Who gives a fuck?  They're fucking musicians.  That's what they are.  Thank you.  That's exactly our point.  By the way, him taking the high road is vomit-inducing.  Hey, guys, really, who cares?  We're all people.  Shut up.  Shut up, Rich.  We all bleed red.  By the way, too, man.  Yeah.  Because she was stuck in the booth.  Great drumming.  They just hung around the aquarium.  And the quiet one over there knows how to fucking play her instrument.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  The Utah Megan.  The Utah Megan.  She doesn't say much, does she?  No.  Oh, I'm not fucking with the drummer.  She puts it all to her. 
[02:54:30]  You're right.  That drummer.  She'll kick your ass.  She'll kick your ass.  Is the drummer your roadie, too?  When you bring me a practice.  I'll put a fucking tattoo on your hand, by the way.  Hey, she saved our ass.  Sometimes you have to drive the bus.  No one fucks with you with her there, huh?  She has Ozzy on her knuckles.  You know how happy that makes me?  All right.  Oh, you got Ozzy on the knuckles.  That's good.  That's Jimmy's favorite band, by the way.  All right.  Jimmy's a big Ozzy guy.  Woo!  That's funny.  Were you in prison?  Huh?  Was she in prison?  She was in Texas.  You got, like, old school tats. 
[02:55:00]  You don't have the girly tattoos.  Those are old school tats, man.  Yeah.  Some real tattoos.  We have nothing else to say to these people.  Thanks for having us on.  Amazing job.  Will you come back and see us?  We weren't too bad.  Hell yeah.  Will you come to our show on Friday?  Fuck yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  We're on Friday.  August 26th.  Irving Plaza.  We'll play in my time.  If you're anywhere near Tommy T's in Rancho Cordova, I will.  Yeah.  All right.  That's where Rich is going to be, because we've got to go.  So you're going to be where again, Rich?  Yeah, Tommy T's in Rancho Cordova.  All right.  It's Thursday through Sunday. 
[02:55:30]  All right.  Back on.  All right, cool.  Les Zeppelin, the big show, is August 26th at Irving Plaza.  And this Wednesday, we'll all be there supporting Steph, because she's going to be doing  a big talk for this book.  Yeah.  Irving Plaza.  Hold on.  Really, really cool.  Thanks.  Thanks so much.  You should tweet that right now.  Hook up there.  Rich, why are you writing it down?  You're open.  No, I'm doing.  I'm at Governor's that week.  Should I get a sexy picture of you guys?  Yeah.  Yeah, get a pic.  Let's get a sexy picture.  You know.  Megan, get in there.  You're going to sex this shit out. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  You want me to jump in there or something?  You guys, if you want to get out of anything, all right.  And I'm doing the Irving Plaza game.  Yeah.  That's pretty sexy right there.  Perfect.  Holding the guitars and stuff.  Yeah.  I think we've got to get out of here, because they're clearing it out for something else.  Clearing out the fishbowl.  Les Zeppelin, everyone.  Thank you so much.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  We'll see you next time.  Just fucking with you.  The Virus.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show continues. 
[02:56:30]  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Already?  Yes.  I guess it's after Opie and Anthony Live.  Even though, technically, I don't think I'm supposed to be on yet.  But, listen, if there's nobody in this studio, and we're coming back from commercial break,  I'm going to take over.  I've said it a hundred times, you know, Opie has said on ONA, it's after 10 o'clock, it's your time. 
[02:57:00]  And I say no, because there hasn't been a commercial break yet.  After Opie and Anthony Live doesn't have such a rigid time schedule that we need to conform to.  And Opie and Anthony didn't feel like returning to our humble abode after spending so much time in the fishbowl with the great Les Zeppelin.  So, I'm here for you people.  Sam Roberts.  I guess you should...  Mars, is this last one the fishbowl? 
[02:57:30]  Should I turn it off?  Yes.  Okay.  Otherwise, what, we would get whatever's going on in there?  Yes.  Wrap-up show or whatever?  Yes.  That would be funny if I was just doing this show and playing Howard's wrap-up show at the same time.  Oh, here comes Eric.  I was about to ask him a question.  Welcome, Eric, to the studio.  Eric Nagel, everybody.  What do we got here?  Oh, bits and stuff.  Um, yeah, I guess we're going to, uh, I figure we'll play some time, in a little bit. 
[02:58:00]  I want to play a couple other famous cover bands that have been in the studio.  And touch on a few things that happened today.  But number one, this came up at the end of the fishbowl broadcast.  Who wrote Les Leppelin on the pad data?  Um, I was in the office, so that's probably Derek.  Where is he?  I guess he's in his studio.  Do you want me to get him on the phone?  Yeah, get him on the phone.  That'll be much easier. 
[02:58:30]  Where is he, Eric?  He's either not there, or he's either in the bathroom, or he's not picking up.  Let's leave a message.  Come on, how long does it take for the machine to...  Oh, here comes Troy running down the hallway.  He's got...  No, it doesn't leave a message.  Wait, he doesn't...  Of course Derek doesn't have a voicemail set up.  Oh, well.  Oh, my God. 
[02:59:00]  I think Troy just ran down.  He must be running down to get Derek.  Maybe Derek knew that we were calling him, so he just let the thing ring.  He's not a social guy.  That's why he's never on this show.  He's just not a social guy.  Troy, you couldn't find Derek?  No, it wasn't back in the studio.  I just want to find out who wrote Les Lepland.  That was Derek.  It was definitely Derek.  Yeah, he was running the board.  He's not a strong speller.  Well, you know.  That's right.  It happens...  I mean, it happens to sacks all the time.  What does?  The misspelling on the pad data.  Is that true, Eric? 
[02:59:30]  Not really, no.  Listen, Eric.  I have to talk to you about something.  First of all...  Wait, phone's ringing.  Oh, you know how to answer it.  Hang on.  Hey, Derek.  You're on the air.  What do you want?  Sam wants to talk to you about the pad data during Les Zeppelin.  Who wrote Les Lepland?  He wants to know who wrote Les Lepland.  I did.  I fucked it up.  Okay.  Okay.  Go about your business.  All right.  Bye.  You see what I mean, Troy, about him not being a social person?  No.  No.  He's just not...  He's here to, I guess, accomplish what he has to accomplish and not make friends in the process. 
[03:00:00]  Nope.  Which I guess is an okay way to be.  Um, I'll talk a little more about Les Lepland in a moment, but I follow Sex Buzzer on Twitter.  I don't know if you do, but it's a Twitter feed that actually, it was created at Opie  and Anthony, the show host's request, that actually chronicles what time the sex buzzer  goes off every morning, and that buzzer, of course, goes off whenever the sex bagel, 
[03:00:30]  Eric Nagel, arrives at the SiriusXM building.  I was looking at it, and today it was, like, usually it's 547 is like a really good day,  but we've lately started venturing more in the 50s, which is, I'd say...  The norm.  The norm, okay, you said it.  Um, today, I look at the sex buzzer on Twitter, it says 532.  Yeah. 
[03:01:00]  What was the deal with that?  I don't know, it's kind of funny, because I come back here about 530 to get the studio  set up for the morning.  Sure.  And Eric was back here setting it up, and he was like, oh, I didn't know you were here,  blah, blah, blah, blah, like, playing off like, oh, I'm here, you know.  I didn't know you were here.  Yeah, yeah, what are you doing here now?  No, I just took care of it.  Well, because he thought, like, if he got here around 530, that's way before anybody  gets here, because that's so early.  So, no, Eric, is that, was the sex buzzer accurate?  Were you really here at 532? 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, I was there.  Oh, my God.  What were you doing here so early?  I got here at that time.  But, like, what, like, you got here literally at least 20 minutes before usual.  Why did you get here that early?  Because I decided I wanted to.  Yeah, what prompted you to give a fuck today?  That's a good way to phrase it.  Well, no, I mean, I'm not, this is a, you know, you did a good job.  You got here almost on time.  Why are you saying he did a good job?  He did what he was, he's supposed to do.  Well, technically, we're supposed to be here before 530. 
[03:02:00]  But that's the other thing.  But why would you give him a good job for that?  Well, because he did the right thing for once.  A good job is going above and beyond what you expect.  When your bosses have told you repeatedly, be here at this time, that's just what he did.  And he's just being defiant all the other times.  Well, I feel like, like you said, he's above and beyond what he normally does,  which is he actually came on time instead of just giving up.  Rob Cross, come here.  Rob Cross, come here.  Did you, do you follow the sex buzzer feed on Twitter? 
[03:02:30]  Rob Cross is one of the.  No, I don't, but I should.  I call bosses.  That sounds awesome.  Opie calls babysitters.  Interns, whatever.  Yes, we had a discussion on Friday about Rob Cross's internship.  I tried to explain to him.  I know what it's ending.  I hope I get, like, a cake or whatever.  Yeah, I tried to explain to him.  Sex buzzer, no, I don't follow it.  I probably should, though.  He was here at 532 this morning, which is huge for the sex buzzer.  I mean, it's never been even close to that early, and he won't.  Like, Eric, are you saying that you decided to get here that early because every other time 
[03:03:00]  is just you being like, fuck you, I'll come in whenever I want?  No, not at all.  Because if that's the case, I have respect for it.  No, not at all.  So what is it?  And I thought that Rob, because Eric talks a certain way when, you know, it's just me  and you, Troy.  Right.  So I figure Rob's in here, too.  Let's get Rob in the mix.  Let's see.  You know, that way everybody can be open.  So, Eric, how come you were here at 5...  And I'm not getting on your case.  I'm saying that's good that you got here at 532.  It seems like Eric rises to the occasion, right? 
[03:03:30]  I mean, you guys are down a guy today, right?  Yeah, but I mean, we've been down guys before, and Eric is...  He's coming while the music is on.  Yeah, he'll be in here at 615.  We'll be two guys down.  I mean, that's not it.  Was it, Eric?  No.  No.  He doesn't give a shit about that.  No.  No.  So what...  Good question.  Lumpy mattress, maybe?  Just woke up early?  Was it a lumpy mattress?  I just got up, and I came to work.  Did you happen to wake up early, or did you specifically wake up on time?  No, I was up early.  How come?  Because I couldn't breathe. 
[03:04:00]  Sleep apnea?  No, I've been congested all weekend, so I was up walking around, blowing my nose.  Do you have to sleep kind of like the elephant man, where you can't lay flat because your  head weighs you down?  Really, Dick?  No.  I'm asking Eric as a question.  Jim, we're just...  First of all, it was Derek who wrote Led Lepland.  Oh, Led Lepland.  Led Lepland, yeah.  And Eric won't tell us.  Like, he's just starting to get to the point, because on the sex buzzer on Twitter, he got 
[03:04:30]  here at 5.32 in the morning this morning, which is huge.  That's great.  I mean, yeah, it's right on time.  Almost right on time and everything.  But for a while, he wouldn't tell us why he got here that early.  He just said, I happened to.  And he just, before you walked in, admitted it's because he woke up not being able to breathe.  Wow.  Is that true, Eric?  Yeah, that's true.  You think that would be an excuse to sleep later?  Like, I can't breathe, so that's why I'm late.  Why can't you breathe?  Is it the weight?  That's when I asked him if his head was weighing him down. 
[03:05:00]  No.  So what are you congested over?  What do you mean congested over?  It doesn't just happen because of emotional issues or something.  You just, like, I just couldn't know.  You know, you're off the dairy, right?  Troy's a diet lifestyle thing.  It could be diet.  It could be allergies.  I didn't mean emotionally when it has you congested.  Like, generally, there is a cause.  Congestion.  It just happens.  It's a great slug line for a product.  Yeah.  All right, Eric.  Well, whatever. 
[03:05:30]  Jim, did you figure out, and congestion doesn't just happen.  Did you figure out who the lesbians were in the band?  Zeppelin?  The drummer.  Yeah, I think that was the obvious one for everyone.  I think that probably most of them were, except I would say the drummer and the lead singer.  Yeah.  I figured that they all were.  I hope Megan was.  You liked her?  The bass player.  She was really cute.  She was sexy.  And she was a good bass player, too.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You like that, that she's a good bass player, too?  Well, of course.  Yeah.  And then, you know, the bass was so much.  She was just a tiny little girl, and she just has this big bass, and she's just all over 
[03:06:00]  the neck, and you're like, yeah, what's up?  So she's the type of orifice that you would enjoy?  Troy went on this show a couple days ago and said that he looks at women as orifices  at this point in his life.  I said, at this point in my life, the only thing I'm interested in is the actual orifice.  I'm not actually interested in having to do with anything else with a woman.  How about the ass crack?  Yeah.  I mean, any of the orifices, I guess.  Any of the three.  Right.  Just pick one.  I gotcha.  Yeah.  Troy, did you think they were all lesbians? 
[03:06:30]  No, I don't know.  Definitely.  I mean, the drummer.  I thought it was a guy when I first heard it.  I was like, oh, there's a guy in the band.  I gotta tell you the truth.  When I walked in, I thought it was a guy, too.  When she had her sunglasses on before she got behind the drum set, I definitely thought  it was a man.  But the other three were cute, and they were really good musicians.  They played well.  They had that Zeppelin groove.  They have it down.  It kind of sucked not to have headphones on, because I couldn't really hear any of the  lyrics.  Like, I couldn't hear the singer at all.  Yeah.  But I'm assuming it turned out okay over there.  They were all trying to fuck me to girls. 
[03:07:00]  Chip, they were lesbians.  That's the thing, man.  What is?  They were like, we want to just fuck you.  I'm like, but you're supposed to be lesbians.  They're like, whatever.  It's true.  I don't think it is, because it's not a very in-depth conversation.  It seems like you just made up a shallow conversation that would never happen.  Yeah, Chip does that.  By the way, do you think we should put part three up soon on the YouTube page?  I haven't even promoted part two.  Part two is up on YouTube slash Chip TV show of Chip Chipperson's Comic Con coverage.  It's a shorter version. 
[03:07:30]  It's like four minutes.  Yeah.  You like it better, longer, or shorter?  Shorter is fine, man.  Yeah.  I mean, it's just embarrassing.  It's so awful.  It's really...  Does it make you cringe?  Yes.  A blithering idiot just walking around.  Who could be comfortable enough?  Like, I don't understand how anybody could...  It almost sounds like he's retarded.  Yeah, but he's not.  But then he just, like...  If you feel bad for him for a second, you're like, oh, is there something wrong with him?  Then he starts saying horrible things about crippled people and minorities.  Yeah.  And you don't feel bad for him anymore.  You just hate him.  Chip's a bit of a racist. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah.  And he hates crippled people.  He certainly does.  Because they're all faking.  Eric.  Yeah.  I believe it was Chip who said he thinks that you should take people in wheelchairs and  put them out in the sun until they dry up like raisins.  Then they'll be walking.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Oof.  He's a moron.  It's not even a funny thing to say.  It's just a dumb...  Yeah.  Idiot thing to say.  It's just a dumb, hurtful thing to say.  Eric, you were in there.  Name the lesbians.  Because I thought that we were going to... 
[03:08:30]  They would tell us at the end.  You guys got to record.  You got to record.  Yeah.  That's fine.  I'll tell you.  This is why Sam is smart.  Because he just keeps asking questions, trying to keep people in the studio.  So he's not here by himself.  That's all I do.  That's a good point.  That's a good way to do it.  Roland, careful.  Roland?  Yes.  Who were the lesbians?  You booked them, right?  It wasn't Pat from Unaki?  Yeah.  That's fine.  Yeah.  It was you, though, right?  Well, who else?  Well, Opie said he thought it was Pat from Unaki.  Yeah.  What can you do sometimes? 
[03:09:00]  You want some, you want some.  Did you like that booking?  Yeah, they're good.  Who do you think the lesbians were in the band?  Because I thought we were going to find out at the end.  Who were the lesbians?  Yeah.  We had the lead singer.  And by the way, I think if he hasn't already, Opie has a picture of all four band members  on his Twitter, Twitter slash Opie Radio.  I know he took the picture.  So I'm assuming it's up there if you want to play along at home and see if you can figure  out.  Jim has some up on his Twitter as well.  The bass player, afterwards, her English accent faded away. 
[03:09:30]  You think she's faking?  Yeah.  She said she was from Utah and had a bit of an accent.  Yeah.  But I would say the guitarist, definitely the drummer, and the singer, he does both.  You think the singer's bisexual?  Yes.  Wow.  What a guess by Roland.  Eric, where are you at?  Obviously the drummer.  I think we're all in agreement.  But I thought the...  Eric thinks scramble eggs, bacon.  That's what you're thinking.  I've never been so sure that somebody was a lesbian since the first time I saw a lady trucker 
[03:10:00]  in person.  Did you hear Rich Ma's joke?  Why did everybody just trample over my lady trucker joke?  Because it wasn't good.  You didn't hear what it was.  I did.  We both made eye contact and we just thought we'd save you.  First of all...  Okay, go ahead.  Try to do it again.  So everything...  How can you not enjoy somebody taking a shot at lady trucker of all the horrible things  she said about you?  Do you know what she said about you?  No.  Well, I'm not going to tell you now.  How does that make you feel?  Bad?  A little bit.  Okay.  Well, now we both feel bad. 
[03:10:30]  So we're on an even playing ground.  That's not nice.  Talk about what Voss said, though.  At the end, he goes, come out of your aquarium.  Voss was really sliding in some jabs that they didn't pick up on.  Yeah.  So, Eric, who did you say the lesbians were?  The drummer?  Well, obviously the drummer, the lead singer, but...  Now, Roland said, very controversially, lead singer, bisexual.  You're saying lesbian.  It's possible, but I think it's more towards the lesbian side. 
[03:11:00]  Lesbionic.  The other blonde who was behind the keyboard...  I forgot what she was playing.  Yeah, the bass.  I think she's the other one, too.  So it's...  The two blondes and the drummer.  So nobody thinks that the guitar player is a lesbian.  You don't see that, Roland.  No.  She seemed more rocker chick, but she didn't seem lesbian.  Marge, what are you working on?  I see some tape and a footstool.  Oh, just location of the lights.  Oh, for the new light?  How come the lights inside that studio is really dim, but over here it's like super bright. 
[03:11:30]  It has the gel on it.  Is that what it is?  It has the gel that they've asked?  Yeah, we've got the gel, too.  Oh, you have the...  So we're going to have the gels and the big TV lights?  Yeah, the gel and the dimmer.  We're making...  Wow.  It should be better.  You don't have a lot of faith.  I was listening, Marge, we were listening at like 5 o'clock in the morning.  Uh-huh.  Travis and me were in the office listening to you and the other engineer set up the studios  because we could get the feet in our office, and we were laughing at the music that you 
[03:12:00]  guys were playing.  That was New Wave.  Yes.  Of course.  Good stuff.  Mars is playing New Wave music.  Listen, I wanted to play while we're talking about...  I keep on saying Les Lepplin.  Les Zeppelin.  Another very famous cover band that was on the Opie and Anthony show in the past.  Very famous moment.  There's a band.  We had them in for Jim's birthday.  It was 2008. 
[03:12:30]  So that was like three years ago.  Not Octane.  Octane is not a cover band.  Oh, I don't know.  They're just that guy from Philly brings them up.  Alice.  They're a good band, but they're not a cover band.  No, this was for Jim's birthday.  Oh, yeah.  And it...  Zabacadabra.  Fatty in Philly?  Hey, Sam.  What's up, Fatty?  First time, long time.  Good to hear.  I know you're the resident shit-stirrer, so I thought maybe you might shed some light  on what Rich Voss said that got him dumped. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, we heard a couple feedbacks that said Voss got dumped, but we didn't dump him in here.  Eric, you didn't dump him, did you?  No, nobody got dumped.  Yeah, we didn't dump him.  I don't know why, but you're not the only person who said that it sounded like that.  He was talking, and then I hit the sweeper to go to commercial, but other than that...  What happened was...  Was it in the middle of the segment or the end?  Well, there was a cut, and Ant even reacted to it.  He sighed heavily, and they kind of quick got off of the subject.  We didn't dump Voss on this end at all. 
[03:13:30]  Very strange.  But like I said, Fatty, that's why I took your call, because a few people were feedbacking  that in.  Where was Tom Chiasano when this happened?  I don't know.  He must have been down the hall somewhere.  Thanks a lot, buddy.  Bye.  But we were talking about cover bands.  For Jim's birthday in 2008, we had Sabra Cadabra in studio.  They're a legendary Black Sabbath cover band.  Arguably, the best Black Sabbath cover band there is, and that's why we booked them. 
[03:14:00]  Chubby Checker.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  That wasn't a Roland booking.  That was a Jill Nicolini booking.  I know.  Because Jill Nicolini showed up.  This was during the summer of Anthelini, of course.  And Godfrey was there.  And Godfrey was there.  And Godfrey was there.  Louis C.K.  Louis C.K. was there, too?  Yep.  Wow.  Was it Russell Peters might have been there, too?  Like, he was like, what the fuck is going on?  Oh, that's right.  Russell Peters ended up coming in that day, and we felt bad, because he just sat in the  chair and barely said a word, because it was Jill was there, Joe Nicolini, Chubby 
[03:14:30]  Checker, Louis C.K., Godfrey, Opie Anthony, obviously Jim, it was his birthday.  Somebody else was there.  And then Russell Peters showed up, so we're just piling people in, and Sabra Cadabra  is in the corner.  Oh, and Michael K.  Williams called in.  Michael K.  Williams called in for Jim's birthday, and this is when we were on 57th Street, so we  had all this room, but the whole back of the studio was all Sabra Cadabra covers,  and Octane is a cover band, blah, he was correcting me, Octane is mostly a cover band, but they 
[03:15:00]  did a single on our show, somebody, William in Delaware.  Thank you, William.  Fuck you, William.  No, don't say fuck you, he was just trying to shed some light on things.  Thank you, William.  He's a fan, he loves Octane.  Thank you, William.  So, we had Chubby Checker in studio, and we realized that we could do something.  I think this was Opie's idea, and do we have Opie's whole setup in this?  Yeah, the negotiation for the money.  Right.  It was pretty short, though. 
[03:15:30]  Right, but I just wanted to make sure.  We wanted to have Chubby Checker perform with Sabra Cadabra.  It was an iconic moment.  It was a moment that Chubby Checker didn't want to do at first, but we made it happen,  and here it is.  While you're playing clips.  Right here.  While we had an early show on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Jimmy, Jimmy, I've got to ask Mr. Checker something.  Hurricane Katrina, you lost a lot.  Now, see, you think I'm Fats Domino. 
[03:16:00]  Everybody, you think all of them.  Oh, Jesus, Opie.  Hey, hey, hey.  Think all the black guys look the same?  That's right.  Unbelievable.  Chubby's grabbing my arm.  Chubby's a strong kid.  Hey, hey, hey.  That's Fats Domino.  That's not Chubby Checker.  Of course it is.  Oh, I'm sorry.  And his lady says, oh, he says, I know you had trouble with this, Katrina.  I says, that's Fats Domino.  I go in the airport.  Guess what they say?  What?  What do they say?  Hey, Mr. Berry.  Freeze.  I says, I'm Chuck Berry.  Mr. Berry.  Lady says, lady says to me, she says, she says, oh, there's Charlie Pryor. 
[03:16:30]  I says, thank you, ma'am.  You know his cousin, Marvin Berry?  I get all that.  I want Frankenberry.  It's so annoying.  I get that all the time, too.  It's like, hey, Mr. Pitt, Mr. Cruz.  Come on, Jimmy.  Jimmy, you have the Chubby.  Hey, Chubby, they only call me Mr. Cruz in the rest area.  Is there any way we could get you to do a little twist with Sabra Kadabra?  I don't know.  I don't want to put you on the spot.  I understand.  I'll tell you what. 
[03:17:00]  I got a question.  What you?  $10,000 to play the...  That mic doesn't work.  Is that all, Gary?  Is that it?  Well, that's without me.  He's got to be the Jewish guy.  I mean, that's it.  Hey, I'm a Jew.  Hey, wait, wait.  I want to hear this.  I'm a Jew.  I can see.  I can see him.  What does this guy say?  I mean, after Bob Dylan.  Hold on.  Let me see.  $10,000, we'll do the twist.  Yeah, well, this was a discount.  This was $20,000 to come to the studio, so you owe us $10,000.  All right. 
[03:17:30]  All right, so play the new record.  We'll be even.  We're the good old boys.  $10,000, we get the twist.  You got my new jam?  What do you got on you?  For about $5,000, sure.  What do you got on you?  You got any money?  Hey, guys, you got the key of E going on?  The key of E?  Key of E.  Oh, you got it?  And I want the bass to give me some eighth notes, some punk stuff.  Oh, yeah.  You might get something going on here.  No, it's got to sound like, more like, listen, listen, listen. 
[03:18:00]  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  Do you think he likes the twist?  I want to punk it out a little bit.  And I want to hear a little Chuck Berry on the guitar.  He loves it.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, just the chords, just the chords.  A little...  Watch for the changes and try to keep up.  Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up.  I don't want to hear a dude...  This is what he's going to do like if Barack was president.  I want straight on Rolling Stones, I want straight on Mellencamp, I want to...  But now, but now you've got to pick it up, you've got to pick it up fast. 
[03:18:30]  Let me hear it.  Okay, let's see, let's see.  Here we go.  All right, let's see.  Chubby's getting up.  Let me hear it again.  He's getting up.  Once again, when I cut down, I want to cut.  One, two, three, ha! 
[03:19:00]  Come on, baby, let's do the twist.  Come on, baby, let's do the twist.  Take me by my little hand.  And go like this.  Come on and twist. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah, baby, twist.  Ooh, yeah.  Just like this.  Come on, little miss.  And do the twist.  My daddy is sleeping.  And a mama ain't around.  Yeah, daddy's just sleeping.  And a mama ain't around.  Gonna twist it, twist it, twist it, twist it.  To reach out the house down. 
[03:20:00]  Come on and twist.  Yeah, baby, twist.  Ooh, yeah.  Just like this.  Come on, little miss.  And do the twist.  Work it for me, work it for me, baby.  Let's go. 
[03:20:30]  No.  So, let's go.  Yeah, you should see my little sis  You should see my little sis 
[03:21:00]  She really knows how to run  She knows how to twist  Come on and twist  Yeah, baby, twist  Ooh, yeah  Just like this  Come on, little miss  And do the twist  Come on  Yeah  That's alright  Yeah 
[03:21:30]  Twist or not  Twist  That is a legendary performance  Wow, Chubby Checker  With Sabra Cadabra  When are you going to see anything like that?  Pretty hot, Bubba  Chubby 
[03:22:00]  Chubby  Chubby  Chubby  Chubby  Chubby  This is amazing  Chubby Checker  Backed up by Sabra Cadabra  So, so perfect  You'd think he'd sang the song 5,000 times  After O&A  Live  What a party that sounded like  It's after Opie and Anthony live  I'm Sam Roberts  He knew that already  But oh my god  I guess we had a studio audience too  That was Chubby Checker  Performing for Jim Norton's birthday in 2008  With Black Sabbath cover band 
[03:22:30]  Sabra Cadabra  And I guess it's because I'm really not musical  I'm not talented at a great deal of things  One of them is music  And I couldn't believe that like  Chubby Checker could just tell the band a couple of things  And then all of a sudden they could play the song exactly how he wanted it  I mean, maybe it's a far more common song than I'm giving it credit for  And it's really not a difficult thing for a band who plays music for a living  But I mean, Eric, you don't play any instruments 
[03:23:00]  Were you?  I used to, but not in a long time  What did you play?  I used to play piano  You played piano?  Yeah  What for?  Like when you were a kid?  Your mom made you take lessons?  Yeah  My mom tried that shit on me when I was a kid  But I wasn't having it  That's the type of kid I was  I don't fuck around  I think I might restart them again sometime  Piano lessons?  Yeah  Why?  Because piano's fun to play  Why don't you play something?  Why don't you take up an instrument that like  Actually you could have a career with  Why don't you like  What can you do with piano? 
[03:23:30]  You play the piano  For what?  For music  For yourself  You just sit there playing piano all day?  You could if you wanted to  Same thing as playing a guitar  No, but guitar people will actually pay to come see you play guitar  If you can get somebody to sing alongside you  There's a million people trying to play the guitar  Piano on the other hand  That's that new shit, huh?  It's the new hotness  I've heard  But were you  Are you blown  Is it because I'm naive  That I was blown away 
[03:24:00]  At the fact that they could just  Chubby Checker could be like  Yeah, do something in a chord of E  And then just cut it off  And that this  Sabra Cadabra could automatically play his song  Exactly how he wanted it  Well, it says a lot for Sabra Cadabra  That, you know  That they can  They're really good musicians  They can change, you know  At a heartbeat  But Chubby's used to playing with just  Like studio musicians  Right  So that those guys are just supposed to know  How to do every kind of change  And not really learn songs  Just play whatever they're backing up  Why don't you be a piano studio musician? 
[03:24:30]  And anytime somebody needs a piano on the track  You call up the sex bagel  Well, if I knew how to play really good  I might do that  Or there was Miri Binari  I think that was her name  She was the hip-hop violinist for a while  When everybody was using violins on tracks  Why don't you become a hip-hop pianist?  Nah  Why no?  I don't really fit that world  Well, I mean  Neither did Miri Binari  You know what I mean?  No  Some people have luck  When are you gonna  When are you gonna take up piano again? 
[03:25:00]  I don't know  I thought about it  You should come in  Piano and guitar  I thought about taking up  Well, which one do you think?  Piano you're leaning towards?  I could do both  You're gonna  How much free time do you have?  You do it whenever you can  How do you  But you don't have  I don't have time to learn piano and guitar  You could do it on the weekends  I have a show to do on the weekends  That's your fault  I don't have any time off, Eric  I've made huge mistakes in my life  But once you know how to play piano  Will you come in here and give us a recital?  Once I remember how to do it 
[03:25:30]  And actually learn some songs  Yeah, why not?  How long do you think that'll take?  I haven't gotten to it yet  So probably gonna be a while  Like weeks, months?  Probably next year  I'll probably still just be here  So you just come over  Whenever you feel like it  Okay, buddy?  Sure  Give me a Casio  And I'll figure out what to do with it  Eric's not the only one out there, folks  With musical talent  As we're playing some  We played that great  Sabra Cadabra  Chubby Checker moment

[03:27:30]  Okay perfect  Thank you very much Roland  It's always good to hear your voice  So while we're celebrating  Some of the great  Musical covers  That have happened  On the Opie and Anthony show  In honor of Les Zeppelin  I wanted to play this  It's Anthony  Live from the Hard Rock Cafe  Singing Sweet Caroline  You'll look at him  In a different way  If you haven't heard this before  And if you have  You'll just be happy  To hear it again  It's Sweet Caroline  As we move on  With After Opie and Anthony Live

[03:35:30]  To go out  And make some extra money  And I have the vacation days  Or he has the vacation  Then it would be like  Oh well  I mean he's just  Motherfuckers  Just trying to eat  Eric I'm not going to  Go any further  With this conversation  How do you feel about that  Troy's got to do  What he's got to do  Exactly  Thank you  Thank you  What do you hear  About this guest  Because I know  You're down  And you're in the shit  You're in the other room  You're really sort of  Getting down and dirty  With this  Getting all the gossip  What do you think  The odds are  Alright  I'm being told  She passed  What  Because she would do  Opie and Anthony  But not you  Why  That I don't know 
[03:36:00]  I didn't see that one  Coming Troy  Yeah  Well  I'm going to give you  A hint  Ladies and gentlemen  She's wrapping up  In a few minutes  Okay  If  Eric  If this guest  Comes in the studio  Should I get the music  No  Stop with the music  You're always trying  To play somebody's music  She doesn't need music  That's all I think  I've got to play  Somebody's music  Exactly  Voss is in  You've got to play  400 Voss clips  We don't need music  What I need  What I need 
[03:36:30]  Is  And I'm sorry Eric  I know you're just  Trying to do your job  Remember when Opie  The other day  Said that was so hacky  Because he played  Somebody's music  That's so fucking hacky  Did he  Yes  That's pretty funny  Who was that Eric  What  Is she coming in  Okay  They're checking right now  If she comes in here  You should get Anthony  On the phone  That's kind of our duty  She's wrapping up right now  Okay  Okay  Roland's on this  And you heard what I said Eric  And that's a hint 
[03:37:00]  To the fans  I'll play the music  When she walks in  I didn't say anything  About the music  And by the way  It was probably Louis CK  Yeah I think you're right  So we played the Louis theme  That was funny  Oh was it Louis CK  Because Opie was just like  It's so fucking hacky to do this  Why do you do this  Especially with Louis  Like he's on the show all the time  Like he's a friend of our show  Like you have to play his theme music  So people are familiarized  We know it  But that's just such a  It's such a nagel move  I think she's coming in  Hang on  Oh my god  Oh my god  I have the music ready  Oh there she is  Oh my god 
[03:37:30]  Is she gonna do this  I'm gonna play the music  And she  She's  Welcome to the show  Hi how are you doing  How are you  Eric  We don't play the  Eric our producer  Leah Thompson everybody  Welcome to the show  Troy clap  So people can get excited  Yay  Yay  Woohoo  First thing I have to do  Is apologize  That this music is playing  That's okay  I like it  I know it's a good song  And everything  But Eric is our producer 
[03:38:00]  And he insists  That when celebrities come in  You have to play  Some kind of music  That they're associated with  You didn't play  Howard the Duck  I sang  I was just gonna say  You know  Eric doesn't  He's not an  Outside the box thinker  He's a  Okay what's immediately  Here in front of me  Leah Thompson  And by the way  Eric you should get  Anthony on the phone  Because obviously  Opie and Anthony  This is their studio  I don't know if you've  Heard of them before  Yes  But Anthony  Is the biggest  Back to the future  Fan you'll ever meet 
[03:38:30]  So I mean he's gonna  Freak out when he  Finds out that you  Are in here for my  Show and not for his  And trust me  He won't find that out  But tell me  Back to the future  Aside  That's yesterday's news  What are you here  Today to talk about  I'm talking about  Switched at birth  That's on ABC  Family  It's about two girls  Who were switched at birth  And I play one of  Their mothers  And at 16 they find out  And have to figure out  The whole thing  Like how to make it work  So it's not like  One of those  Freaky Friday type things  It's actually babies 
[03:39:00]  Babies  Who were switched  It's not like  There's some magical  Vase or something  Yeah  They were just  Switched at the hospital  Yes  So is this a comedy  Or a drama  Well it's interesting  Because it's a drama  It's an hour kind of drama  But they cast three people  Known for their comedy  As the lead adults  So it kind of  Who are the other  You  Constance Marie  And D.W. Moffat  Are the other  Constance Marie was on  The George Lopez show  And I was on  Caroline and the City  So it makes a lighter  Touch for it  And today is kind of 
[03:39:30]  The cliffhanger  Where you find  One of the fathers  That you didn't know about  Oh my gosh  It's like super hot  I will have to check this out  Because there are  I mean ABC Family  Is doing a lot  For original programming  I mean they've had  A lot of hits  Which it's pretty good  For cable  Because it seems like  A lot of cable channels  Are getting original series  That are actually hitting  I mean Secret Life  Of the American Teen  And shows like that  Are crazy on ABC Family  So it must  Yeah  And we're keeping up  With them  Yeah  We're doing really well  They just ordered  32 shows for the season  Which is kind of unheard of 
[03:40:00]  32  32  Cable's usually 12 shows  So are you sitting there  Like look  I like doing this show  But I have to do 32 episodes  The writers passed out  Yeah  They were like  What are we going to do  What are you going to do  Are you  So I'm hoping I get  Into a lot of trouble  Yeah  They're going to have to  They have 32 episodes  To fill  I would assume  There will be some trouble  For you  Yes  Is it amazing to you  Because Hollywood  Like most people  Have very short careers  Is it amazing to you  Especially after doing  Like Back to the Future  And Howard the Duck  Which are very 
[03:40:30]  Sort of like  Niche  Cult things  Right  Do you still  You're still flourishing  In this business  Pretty much  Yeah  Well I had a good friend  When I started out  He was like  This is a long distance run  You need to just think of it  As like  And pick your projects  Kind of like that  So yeah  I've been lucky  There's been a lot  Of ups and downs  I can still get a table  In a nice restaurant  So that's good  And you still get recognized  All the time  I do  And it goes  It kind of goes in and out  Like sometimes  I'm not recognized at all  And actually  What's really weird  Is I don't notice it 
[03:41:00]  I like have made it  So I don't notice it  So my kids are always like  That guy's like busted you  And I'm like what  So I don't notice it  Tell me this  What was your favorite  Lorraine Baines McFly  To play  Because we saw her  In Biff Future  We saw her in the 50s  We saw her in the  Real present  And then the slightly  Better present  Right  What was the best one  And then like  For some unknown reason  I was the great grandma  Of course  That was weird  Family resemblances  I think the  I think the Biff Lorraine part 
[03:41:30]  Where I was like  You were the one  Who wanted me  To get these  Things  When Marty wakes up  And compliments you  On being so thin  Yeah  Right  That was my favorite character  And I just recently  Put her on my reel  Because I was like  No one will give me  That part now  Oh really  No one would think of me  For the diva  Yeah  The drunken  Staggering around  Vegas diva  Which I did  When I was 24  And you did a fabulous  Job of it  And before 
[03:42:00]  You have to go  There wrapping you up  Because you got  150 things to do  Did it ever get weird  Doing this sort of  Incest stuff  When Marty went back  To the past  Where you like  This is even weird  For me as a performer  No  I've got a kind of  An iconoclast  Sense of humor  So I kind of appreciated  That it was the weirdest  Thing in the world  And you did a lot  For Calvin Klein underwear  I know  They never even gave me  A free pair  That's insane  I sat next to him once  I was like  Dude  Come on  Thank you  And when is the show on?  Monday night  Tonight  At 9 or 10 
[03:42:30]  Depending on where you are  Okay so it's either  9 or 10  But why don't you watch  From like 8 until 11  It's after  So you'll definitely  See the show  It's after the secret  Life of an American teenager  On ABC Family of course  Everybody's got that channel  Well thank you  Thank you so much  Thank you  We're going to take pictures  Troy you're going to  Take the show over  While I take a picture  Are you good with that?  Such pressure  It's just going to be  Like 20 seconds  Thanks guys  Thank you  I got to say  I love Space Camp  I don't know  That probably doesn't get  That was one of my 
[03:43:00]  One of my favorite shows  One of my favorite movies  As a kid  But  Casual sex  Casual sex  I'm taking some pictures now  I'd like to slide in for a picture  If at all possible  As well  Who's hosting that?  There was nobody  It was on autopilot  For a second  Alright  I'm going to take over  Troy  Alright  What a thrill this is  I'm going to jump in real quick  I love that the pictures  Are being taken  Because then it's like  She's still on the show  She hasn't left yet  Because I'm going to miss her  When she's gone  Thanks you guys  Thank you so much  For stopping by  After Opie and Anthony live  I mean 
[03:43:30]  It's amazing  How many A-listers  Come through these doors  And Leah Thompson  Might be my favorite  Thank you so much  Roland  You've done it again  Give it up for Roland  Everybody  Well also  Spencer though  He helped out too  Spencer is the man  Let me tell you something  There was  There was a thing here  At SiriusXM  And  I'm not telling tales  Out of school  If that is how the  I'm very bad  With expressions  So I sometimes  Get them very mixed up  But  When  Before Roland got here 
[03:44:00]  Jim would complain  About it on the air  Liam was our ally  In the talent  Department  But beyond that  We felt like  We might have enemies  We didn't know  What the vibes were like  And the talent department  Was really kind of  Spread thin  Because they have to  Try to get it over  Everybody else  They were spread very thin  And it's like  We just came in here  And they were already  Spread thin before we got here  So it's kind of hard  To play devil's advocate  It's kind of hard  For the talent department  To automatically take us on  As a priority  When they're already  Trying to book for everyone else  The morning mashup  Howard Stern 
[03:44:30]  Blah blah blah  And so we came on  Roland  And not to say  Like I said  The talent department  Didn't do anything wrong  It was just like  What's our role here  We're used to having  Somebody who's specializing us  And the talent department  Is saying  That's not how it works  And also  Correct me if I'm wrong  But fighting for time  With the person  As opposed to  You break it up  Between 10, 10, 10, 10  It's like  No we want  This and that time  And somebody has to  Fight that fight  Roland comes in here  He gets the job here  At Sirius  And not only 
[03:45:00]  Have we gotten  Amazing guests  Because of Roland  But like we just said  With Spencer  The entire talent department  Has become a happy family  Thanks to that guy  Right there Roland  And Spencer  Is also a new addition  Since Roland has been added  And he  Let me tell you something  Spencer, Annabella, Liam  We all love each other  Annabella  I love Annabella  A-Lo is fantastic  I haven't worked with him  As much as I've worked with Annabella  Otherwise there'd be more love  And I'm sure one day  We'll work together  And I'll love that man  As much as I love Annabella  Liam's awesome  Liam is the shit 
[03:45:30]  He's been the shit  Since day one  And the Spencer Roland tag team  It's furious  I mean it's a force  To be reckoned with  When it comes to talent booking  You got the  We just had Leah Thompson  On After Opie and Anthony Live  Are you kidding me?  This is a show  Let me tell you something  This is a show  That a lot of people said  Didn't make any sense  People said it's not gonna happen  They put it off  For quite some time  People said it's stupid  People said there's no reason for it  Eric you heard him say it 
[03:46:00]  Troy you heard him say it  Roland you heard them say it  Oh I heard him say it twice  And now  Yeah  And now this is a show  That's hosted interviews  With Nick Cannon  After all the shit  That Opie and Anthony  Talked about Nick Cannon  This is a show  That's hosted interviews  With Nick Cannon  This is a show  That's had Loverboy  Perform live  Fuck yeah  Working for the weekend  Not even the song  They wanted to play  Working for the weekend  Weird Al  With Ron Bennington  And Sam Roberts  That was huge  And now  Leah Thompson  And she looks great  She looks fantastic 
[03:46:30]  And she grabbed her boobs  Oh yeah  Yeah when she was doing the thing  Yes I was like whoa  I tried to take a picture  Because I was just so memorized  Like whoa  You were memorized  It's mesmerized  Oh mesmerized  I know  Rich Voss  We're all jittery  From the Leah Thompson thing  I definitely got nervous  In front of her  Because I was like  I love Space Camp  It was my favorite show  What?  She loved that though  That was a great  And by the way Eric  I was wondering  How the Back to the Future music  Was going to go over  Because it's like  She's here to promote her show  And you're there 
[03:47:00]  Look at Leah Thompson  And Troy together  And you're there  And her daughter's cute too  Yeah  Well she looks like Leah Thompson  Of course she's going to be cute  I wonder how old she was  But what difference  120s  Why don't you be a little more respectful  Well I'm just asking  I'm just asking  I said she was cute  What's the problem  Then you said  I wonder how old she is  Wow  I mean if she's like 14  I don't feel like an asshole  Saying that  But she's in here  Promoting her ABC family show  That's on tonight  Either at 9 or 10  At 10 o'clock  10 p.m  10 p.m  And then 9 central  10 9 central yeah  So 10 p.m tonight  Her ABC  And look 
[03:47:30]  I know that like  You animalistic virus fans  Might not watch ABC family  I do  But I do too  Me and Jess sit there  Watch ABC family  A lot of you have kids  Alright  I know you do  You pretend you don't  And you call up  The Opie and Anthony show  Like you're just crazy  You know  You go home  And you're a sweet father  To your children  I know a lot of you are  Why don't you  Do me this favor  And go home tonight  And turn on ABC family  At 10 o'clock  Or 9 if you're in central time  Even earlier if you're 
[03:48:00]  On the west coast  But turn on ABC family  And watch Switched at birth  Okay  Because it's a show  About babies getting  Switched in the hospital  That's crazy shit  I mean Troy  Yeah  Imagine if you got  Switched in the hospital  Right  Picture this  You get switched in the hospital  You're 16 years old  Right  And you find out  That these folks  That you've been calling  Mom and dad  You don't actually know  Them from a hole in the wall  Because they're not your parents  Yeah  You got switched at birth  Yeah  That'd be fucked up  That's crazy shit  It is  I've watched that show  And Leah's getting to the bottom 
[03:48:30]  Of it right  Yeah  She's breaking it down  Yeah  She's breaking walls down  Sam also  Next week  You have a big A-lister  On the after show  I do  Who  Joel  Because he's coming  He's gonna  Well I don't  We'll see how that works out  We'll see if I can count that or not  He should be okay  Because he's here for 10 to like 1040  So 5, 11  So  Yeah but if the hosts stay  And don't play my sweeper  It's on my show  I said that at the beginning  That's why I got to take over  At 930 today  Because it's when the sweeper hits 
[03:49:00]  That's when my show  You're on  Before he comes in  Hit the sweeper  Just hit it  But like I said Eric  I was very  I was nervous  About you playing that dumb  Back to the future music  It's so  The audience would recognize  Where she was from  Who's not gonna recognize  Where Leah Thompson is from  There's a lot of stupid people  And Eric  You know how they would recognize  Where she was from  I'd be like  Oh Leah Thompson  From Back to the Future  Yep  And then they get that  You just  You love your music cues  As I say though  Sam is so good  He goes  Let's not talk about that now 
[03:49:30]  And how you run it back  To the circle  Right  That way she feels comfortable  Roland and Spencer  Are not put in a weird place  We're talking about  The ABC Family Show  Got the plug in  That's what  Got the plug in  Then get my  Two little Back to the Future  Questions in  Look Roland  I'm learning  I'm just learning right now  I forgot she was in  Howard the Duck  I was gonna bring that up  See  And Leah Thompson  Spoiled this for me  Because my plan was to say  You know  Leah  You've been in a lot of movies  And  You know  People still talk about him  To this day  Obviously 
[03:50:00]  I'm talking about Howard the Duck  See that was the little joke  Because you'd think I was leaving  Back to the Future  Right  But then she  I liked Howard the Duck  I loved it  And I like that she embraces  Her past  Yeah  Like she embraces the thing  Well if she  Steve Sterniolo  Come in here  If she didn't do much past that  Come on in here Steve Sterniolo  We gotta tell him what happened  If she didn't do much past that  She probably wouldn't have embraced it  As much as she did  Yeah  Because she has a body of work afterward  Yeah  You know  Steve Sterniolo  I just wanted to share the good news  With you too  Steve Sterniolo  For those of you who still don't know  Who he is 
[03:50:30]  He's an after show star  Sterniolo  I don't know if that's how you pronounce his name  No it's fine  Okay  He's been on the Opie and Anthony show  Once or twice  Once  You made an impact though  Yeah  They didn't hate me  Or destroy me verbally  Which was pretty nice  Was nice for you  Yeah  But you've been on the after show  A whole bunch of times  And you're on Raw Dog  Yes  With Sunny in the Morning  That's what it's called right  Doesn't matter does it  It's funny in the morning  But continue  Whatever the morning show is on Raw Dog  Continue pal  By the way  I love Raw Dog 
[03:51:00]  I do want to make that clear  Love Raw Dog  Anybody listening out there  Love the channel  My boss isn't in today  So  Okay well then  Whatever  Lukewarm at best  But  He's also the host of the phone show  He does a lot of things  You probably  You've probably heard his voice  It's a big seven promo after all  If you want a little  Industry jargon  You know what just happened in here  You know who was just in here  Talking to me  Roland and Troy  No before Roland and Troy  E-Rock  No after E-Rock  Travis  It wasn't Travis  It was Leah Thompson

[03:53:00]  And Opie said by the way  They were only a little bit early  They weren't terribly early  And Opie said  We went late  Every day last week  We can have a couple minutes  We're not going to go back  To the studio  And do 20 minutes  Which I get  Were they able to  Escape management  Because this was something  That was on their mind  Do you know Eric  Oh sorry  I was deleting  Phone show promos  From our log  Yeah  They were  They managed to escape  They did  They did  Well um  Because Opie  I'm going to go to the bathroom  And then  Alright 
[03:53:30]  And then  Did I stop  And run to the elevator  What a son of a bitch  That Opie is  I love it  It was so funny  The one day  Seeing him fly down  This hallway  That was when we were  On the  It was my new game  It was when we were  On the air  And uh  And Roland  Says  Oh is it right or left  And he's just looking at him  Smiling  And Troy  You saw him run past you  I saw him through the window  It looked like he was running  As fast as he possibly could  Like falling ass  And people are working down there  And you could hear  Like cause the floors are hollow  Cause they run all the wires  Underneath the floor  And it was like  Boom boom boom boom boom boom 
[03:54:00]  And here comes Opie  Flying down and goes out the door  And this is one of the biggest shows  On the platform  So everybody down there  Knows who Opie is  Yes  And they don't see him  All that often  Right  And now they just see this maniac  Running  Running at top speed  It's beautiful  Because my game  I said left or right  He said  Don't fuck with me  You tell me right  I was like oh  Go left  Um  Roland  You were uh  Kind of under fire  A little bit today  I wanted to mention that  Uh  At the beginning of the show  Opie said he didn't like  Bridesmaids 
[03:54:30]  It is  A quick  It's a  You have to  You have to go in the  Chick flick state of mind  That in the chick flick world  I'll tell you this  If you go in expecting a chick flick  You'll be pleasantly surprised  Well it doesn't mean this is like the dirtiest chick flick  If you go in expecting a raunchy guy's comedy  You'll be like  It's a bunch of girls  Yeah it's kind of like  If you're seeing a foreign movie with subtitles  And you're like  I have to read  It's  It's a quiet taste  You didn't see Bridesmaids Troy?  No  Eric did you see Bridesmaids?  No I did not  So like  Just for  Like um  Um 
[03:55:00]  Uh  What's the Justin Timberlake movie?  Friends with Benefits  I wish you would stop talking  That movie is good  No it's not  That movie is good  Ashton Kutcher just made that movie  Well Ashton Kutcher's one  Sucked donkey balls  Finally a negative review from Roland  It smelled worse than my taint  In this hot summer day  Wow  So what  What made Justin Timberlake's version  Better than Ashton?  It's funny  Mila Kunis is hilarious  Justin's really good  He's not a good actor  He's good  He's not a funny guy  This is a good movie  What do you think of Justin Timberlake Troy? 
[03:55:30]  I have no problem with you  He's a talented little fella  I really don't  He could act  Like every time he does something  It's like yeah okay  He does it well  He's fun  This movie is really good  I saw it twice already  That's cause you slept through the first one  No this one I stayed awake  Both times?  Both times I stayed awake  Wow  It's a good movie  What's so good about friends with benefits?  It's funny the way it is  I would never  It's like  You know what  No series attached to Ashley Kutcher one  Yeah  Was just so bad  Roland would be a great date for a girl  It really  Cause you would  He would go to a chick flick  And then afterward  They would be goofing about it 
[03:56:00]  And having fun about the little cute parts  Yeah but then wouldn't he be rolling  More towards like  A girlfriend  Than a date  Like don't girls  Kind of want somebody  That like  Isn't like  Oh my god  It was so cute  Well  Yeah but I think that  You know  Sometimes girls like something  You can relate to  They can relate to each other with  You know like  I don't know  I think Roland would make a good date  For a girl to go out to a chick flick with  Are you sure  Or are you flirting with him?  Cause it's starting  I wouldn't flirt  I'm just  I'm telling him that  He has the mentality  The mentality of being able to do that 
[03:56:30]  Where I could go to see one of those movies  I would just  I would hate it  I would hate it with everything I had in me  See I would go like  Oh Terminator  And then she goes  Oh let's see if he found those benefits  And I go  Alright  And so I think  Woohoo  Yeah good choice  Yeah well  I mean Troy  There is a difference between like  Roland coming out  And be like  Oh my god  Justin Timberlake was so funny  And you going  Ah that sucked  You could just be like  Oh yeah that was cute  You want to go someplace else  Yeah  Yeah but I think he would actually  Be willing to engage in conversation 
[03:57:00]  About the movie  And go into  This was funny when they did this  I have to hold back the tears  You do  There's uh  The thing about it is  You do  Kind of have a reputation  For never giving a negative movie review  Doesn't that kind of discount  All of the reviews?  Not really no  You just happen to be a fan of film  It's like that guy from Channel 7  Back of your cab  That son of a bitch  I'll tell you this  That asshole  That son of a bitch  Who kicked my chair twice before  For falling asleep  If he doesn't get interviewed  With a celebrity  He hates the movie  Is that what it is? 
[03:57:30]  Yeah even some of the newspapers  Who's that  What's his name?  ABC guy  Yeah  It's right on the tip of my tongue  Because when we saw Superman  As a staff  He was Sandy  Kenyon  Sandy Kenyon  Or Sandy Kenyon  Kadoosh  Kadoosh  Yeah  Oh no that guy  If he doesn't get interviewed  He'll go  The movie  It's like Ben Lyons  Like he's so vanilla  If he doesn't get interviewed  He goes yeah it's alright  But if he gets interviewed  It's fantastic  Ben Lyons drives me crazy  I just want to punch him 
[03:58:00]  He just got it  Because he's Jeffrey Lyons' son right?  Yeah  And he's  He's like the  Ryan Seacrest of interviewers  Yeah but I could be  The Ryan Seacrest of interviewers  I just don't have  A Jeffrey Lyons father  I mean I'll sell my soul  To get on E  What difference would it make  Yeah  I would be  You know  After this whole diatribe  That I just had with you  If I was sitting down  With Justin Timberlake  On E  I'd be like  What's it like  To be so talented  At everything  Because you are  Nothing  Like I would lie  You know what I mean  I wouldn't care 
[03:58:30]  Yeah but there's  For a job on E  Yeah  But look at the newspapers  On Sunday  The interviews they give  Celebrities  And then you read  The reviews the next week  It's like four star  Yeah  If they don't get  The interviews  They're pretty brutal  I love when Roland comes in  And he just displays  The dark underbelly  Of show business  Is that the dark  It's like  People will know  If you don't already know  Email Sandy Kenya  Say he's a douche  He annoys me at cabs  Every morning  Hi I'm Sandy Kenya  I'm like ugh  Tell me this Troy 
[03:59:00]  If you don't know  Now you know  Roland  You wanted to say it  Well of course I wanted to say it  You love the word  What are you going to say Eric  I was trying to remember  It was Jeffrey Lyons  The one that got pissed off  At Patrice  Yes  Yes  Okay  Yes  And then he was like  My son is going to be  A very successful movie  And it's pretty  Nah judge me  Well I wanted  While we were talking  About Leah Thompson  I wanted to play a clip  That I had Eric  Pull for me  Actually a couple days ago  Actually  Do we have the  Don Cheadle interview 
[03:59:30]  Isolated  Yeah give me a second  I'll pull that up  Okay  I also found Leah Thompson  Singing Howard the Duck  Maybe we'll end with that today  Alright  That could be nice  Don't you think Troy  Yeah  Here's what we'll do  And play the Don Cheadle thing  Not all the before stuff  Just like from the time  He gets in the studio  If you  You know  That's not extremely difficult  Alright hang on one second  Okay yeah yeah yeah  Cause we had Don Cheadle  Opie and Anthony  Not we  I know you're thinking  Man Sam  Leah Thompson  Don Cheadle 
[04:00:00]  You really do talk to all the A-listers  This one  I gave to the boys  O and A  They spoke to Don Cheadle  And when I say spoke  It was literally  I guess they got a sentence out  He was booked to do  Sway's show  Cause Sway's the new  Morning guy on Shade 45  And I think he goes later  Than O and A  So if at any point  You don't like  Listening to me  I don't care  Just go listen to Sway  He plays a lot of music though right  Yeah  He's probably playing  Watch the Throne today  I'll probably listen to him  But Don Cheadle was in here 
[04:00:30]  To do Sway's show  And we saw him  And with the help of  Actually Stanley T  From the Morning Mashup  I don't know if you saw him  But Stanley T  Comes over to Don Cheadle  Like their friends  And puts his arm around him  And goes  Oh these guys are waving you in  You gotta do their show  And he basically just throws  Don Cheadle into our studio  I got it  It's 25 seconds  And so this was  And it just happened last week  So you might have  You probably heard it  But if you didn't  And if you did  It's 25 seconds  Get over it  This is the Don Cheadle  Obi and Anthony experience  He's like 
[04:01:00]  I'm going in here man  Yeah he's booked up  How you doing Don Cheadle  I was on the plane  I was on the plane with you yesterday  How you doing man  Don we just want to say hi  That's all  I know you're busy  Big fan man  We can't take you away  From another show  That's not fair around here  But  Yeah look  Look  Get him in  Get him in  See look  Don Cheadle  Don Cheadle ladies and gentlemen  We could officially say  We could officially say  We had Don Cheadle on the show  Add him to the list  Of celebrities  That have done the  Obi and Anthony show  See  Don Cheadle ladies and gentlemen  What a great interview he was  You can kind of hear his voice off mic 
[04:01:30]  Kind of  And his mic  Like Mark Maron  Has just an amazing podcast  But just in that one isolated clip  He sounds like a maniac  Because they're saying  Hi Don Cheadle  Don Cheadle  And you just hear Mark Maron's voice going  Ah I was on the plane with you  Like  It was just funny  Because I mean  That doesn't  Suit him at all  But  Out of context  This wasn't the first time  We hijacked an interview  And we actually got into trouble  For the first time we did  And it was from  Shade 45  They're probably  Just about 
[04:02:00]  Sick and tired  Of the Obi and Anthony show  At this point  Because  It was  And it reminded me of  Leah Thompson  Because it was another  Quick interview  Like how long did we do  With Leah Thompson  Probably  Three minutes  Three minutes  Three or four minutes  Well  Marion Barry  Was in the hallway  It was a year ago  At this point  Wow  It was a year ago  What's today's date  I think it's  It was a year ago yesterday  What timing Sam  What timing  Thank you  Marion Barry  He was outside  Waiting to go on 
[04:02:30]  Shade 45  Jim insisted  That we talk to the man  So real quick  While we still got time  This is Marion Barry  It's actually  Sorry I wrote the day wrong  It's two years ago  Same date  But two years ago  We've been here for way too long  Marion Barry  On the Obi and Anthony show  After O&A Live  Marion Barry  Is that Marion Barry's here?  Bring him in  Oh hilarious  Get him in here  Get him in here  Marion Barry  Former governor of Washington D.C.  Got busted smoking crack  Came back and won again  Right didn't he? 
[04:03:00]  He came back again  He did  Become the mayor again  One of the biggest comebacks ever  Yeah  Got caught smoking crack  And the best thing was  When they were interviewing people  Like in D.C.  Everybody smoke a little crack now and then  Who don't smoke a little crack?  Everybody smoke a little crack  And all these people  Like what do you think about Marion Barry  Coming back into the office?  I don't know man  What's the big deal?  Most of the population agree  They're like sure  We do  Why not?  Why not a little?  Yeah  That'd be nice  Get him in here a couple minutes  There's a bunch of dudes next door  That are cock blocking 
[04:03:30]  He's shaking his head no  There he is  Mr. Marion Barry  Mr. Marion Barry  Give him a microphone  Give him a microphone right now  Give him a mic  Hello sir  Yeah  We'll be nice  We'll be nice  We just wanted to say hi to Marion Barry  How many of you are in here?  One, two, three  Yeah we got a lot of people in the end today  Gang up for me man  No, no, no  We were totally respectful  No ganging up  No sir  Thank you  You're actually a story  An inspirational story to a lot of people  Because things went bad at one point  And then all of a sudden  You came back 
[04:04:00]  And you got redemption  It's a pretty inspirational story  That's why this movie is so important  Because most of the media  Outside of Washington D.C.  Most of the people outside of Washington D.C.  Only know me through 15 second news clips  Or 30 second news clips  Or some negative article in the newspaper  They don't know about my 50 years of service  And 35 years of political life in Washington  And being very successful  Helping a lot of people  So that's why that's important  I was walking by  And I heard you all say something about 
[04:04:30]  Being popped for smoking crack  You know, put that in context  The FBI spent $25 to $40 million  Trying to entrap me  They couldn't find anything financial on me  Because I don't dip into the till  They used that situation  Set it up  And we don't know what was in that pipe  Because the jury didn't convict me  Of anything at the Vista  And so that crack story started with that  But there's been no evidence  That we don't know what was in it  I mean, I was up there 
[04:05:00]  For some other reason, quite frankly  What did you think was in it  When you were smoking it?  I didn't smoke it  I just took one drag on it  Oh, okay  Do you feel that they were trying to railroad you  Because they didn't like politically  What you were doing?  They didn't like me economically  Giving money to African-Americans  And, you know, qualified contractors  And putting parts about this size  And we take it 47% of it  Which I got to  And they don't like the money to be taken  It is pretty amazing that they can do that  That they can go after you like that  Spend so much money to try to prosecute you 
[04:05:30]  Well, I'm used to it  They're pulling you out  We're pulling you out  We are being married  Thank you, sir  Thank you, Barry  What's the name of this show?  Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  How many of you are the Opie?
