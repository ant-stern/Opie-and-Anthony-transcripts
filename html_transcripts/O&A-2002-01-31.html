<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast centered heavily around the "Naughty Nighty" photo contest,  featuring pictures of women submitted from various cities, and the upcoming "Chowder Bowl" clam chowder eating contest in Boston, both with Super Bowl tickets as prizes. The hosts, Opie and Anthony, spent a significant portion of the show critiquing the submitted photos, using highly vulgar and sexually explicit language to describe the contestants' appearances and frequently ranking them based on attractiveness, often making offensive and sexist remarks about women from different cities.  The low number of entries from New York City and Boston were heavily mocked.  Numerous listener calls reacted to the photos, with some contestants, like Leanne (#36), complaining about the quality of their submitted pictures.  Several other calls involved unrelated topics, such as hockey rivalries (Islanders vs. Rangers), general banter, and sexually suggestive or crude humor. A seemingly fake call from Dennis Leary was briefly featured.

The show included interviews with several "Naughty Nighty" contestants, focusing on the degree of nudity in their photos and prompting debates about acceptable levels of exposure. A contestant from Washington, D.C., was highlighted for her topless photo, leading to complaints from contestants in other cities, particularly Cleveland, where photos seemed to have been censored.  Contestants included Katie (who recounted how a photo in a red dress helped her get a job interview), Sasha (a professional female wrestler), and two strippers from Gallagher's.  The hosts also interacted with walk-in contestants and representatives from ClassicPinball.com, who brought a Terminator 2 pinball machine to the studio (replacing one allegedly broken by Opie). A caller, Joe, attempted to promote Eatabullet.com, but was dismissed by the hosts.  Anthony Jason from WJFK in Washington D.C. provided updates on other contestants.

The logistics and humorous potential disasters of the Chowder Bowl were extensively discussed, including bowl size, time limits, and the potential for spills or unfinished bowls.  A lengthy, expletive-laden rant from a recording of former baseball manager Earl Weaver was played.  A significant segment involved a comedic misunderstanding during a "silent game" with contestant Katie, who repeatedly called back believing the line was disconnected.  The show featured several "FU line" calls, where listeners aired grievances.  A major argument erupted between Anthony and a caller, "Frenchy," involving considerable cursing and insults,  interrupted by other calls and contestant introductions.  The hostsâ€™ difficulties obtaining proper identification from some contestants led to friction between them.  Adrian from Boston withdrew from the "Naughty Nighty" contest, prompting more jokes about Boston's low participation.  Teen Shannon returned with new photos.  Caller Chrissy attempted to introduce a new segment involving a "queef" sound made with a whistle. Pete the Chef called in, foreshadowing the Chowder Bowl. Calls from a frustrated driver for one of the hosts were also interspersed throughout.  The show concluded with continued recruitment for the "Naughty Nighty" contest in Boston, with the hosts expressing dissatisfaction with the previous photographer and promising to take pictures themselves the next day.  The repeated emphasis throughout the show was on the upcoming Boston broadcast, including details and increasingly absurd elaborations on the Chowder Bowl competition.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Is this a brand of humor you can appreciate?  Alright, let me get a little saucy here.  For the love of Eve, you bet.  Life serves you up lemons, you make lemonade.  We're a little out of control here.  Stop cracking wise.  Oh my stars.  Don't f*** yourself.  Tasteless, offensive.  A lot of ass grabbing.  Horrific and tasteless.  People going daft just makes me want to stick a knife in someone.  Stuff you get here on this show.  Aren't we supposed to be trained to gain listeners, guys?  No! 
[00:00:30]  Is that a surprise to you?  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oi, couple phone numbers right off the bat because we've got to get into this.  In the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including...  Yes.  Boston!  Boston, again?  Of course, again.  The Chowder Bowl.  Yeah, I can't wait.  It's 24 hours away.  We'll have details in just a bit.  Yes, we do have a pair of Super Bowl tickets.  It's going to be puke-erific. 
[00:01:00]  Yes, it's going to be a...  If I could say puke-erific.  It's going to be a puke-fest.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're broadcasting live from Boston tomorrow.  So, ladies in New York, you know, you don't have to come down tomorrow for the Naughty Nighty Contest.  Oh boy, that's going to mess things up.  But then again, you haven't been coming down at all lately.  Exactly.  What the hell did we do to you?  You've completely let us down.  They've abandoned us.  The girls in New York.  But tomorrow, when we're in Boston with guys puking, with someone walking away with Super Bowl tickets, 
[00:01:30]  the girls in the Boston area, they can come down with their Naughty Notties.  We'll get their pictures taken.  Right.  We'll do what we did to Philly.  Yeah.  We'll take care of the problem up there in Boston and get all the lovelies in their Naughty Notties.  I think that'll help us being there.  Well, Anthony, speaking of the Naughty Notties.  Turn this thing around.  Contest.  A lot of developments overnight.  Yes.  Let me get my reference page up here. 
[00:02:00]  So I can play along at home.  You want the latest countdown of the contestants?  Yeah, let's...  To see which cities are representing and which cities are not representing.  All right.  In first place, with 17 contestants, it's still...  Philly.  Philly.  17.  17 contestants.  17 smoking contestants.  All smoking.  Then up next will be Cleveland, with 13 contestants in the Naughty Notties contest. 
[00:02:30]  We got another three girls overnight.  Yeah.  And nice.  There's some nice new pictures from Cleveland to check out if you go to opianthony.com.  Nice crapper.  Which one?  Well, look at this one over here.  I like her.  Yeah.  The one in the little lavender outfit, right?  Uh-huh.  See-through.  Very see-through.  Let me see this one.  The third one from Cleveland.  And then one girl went from like a six and a half to an eight by just putting her hair in ponytails.  You notice that?  A little pigtails.  And thrown on a Catholic schoolgirl outfit. 
[00:03:00]  Yes.  All right.  Now let me...  Oh, Jesus.  What?  Oh, yeah.  Well...  We'll get there.  Hold on.  Hold on.  The back of the heart.  All right.  So there's 13 contestants in Cleveland.  Jesus.  Then, uh...  New York...  Does our name have to be in the picture?  New York has eight contestants, Ant.  Yeah.  That's where we have the problem.  We haven't had a new contestant in the Naughty Nighty Contest coming from New York in over a week. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  You bitches.  I hope the ladies stopped by today with their Naughty Nights here.  Come on.  Here in New York.  They make us beg.  You're making us, uh...  We're pretty embarrassed.  Very.  It's, uh...  You're letting us down.  Our home base here.  New York.  You're not letting us...  Uh...  You're not letting us down as much as Boston is letting us down.  But, uh...  New York, you are letting us down.  Yeah.  So, eight contestants from New York.  And then, uh, uh, three from D.C.  Three smoking babes from, uh, D.C. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Representing in the Naughty Nighty Contest.  And then Buffalo.  I expected more from Buffalo at this point, Anthony.  Yeah.  Two contestants, uh, representing Western New York right now.  And then, uh, Boston and Sacramento with one contestant each.  That's right.  We said Boston with one contestant.  Yep.  They are on the board, Anthony.  They are on the board.  And, well, the instant feedback's coming in like crazy.  All right.  Should I just read some of these?  Wearing a Pat shirt. 
[00:04:30]  She's wearing a Pat shirt.  Right.  There's your representation, Boston.  Go to opianthony.com.  What number is she in?  In the contest?  Oh, 44.  44.  Yeah.  All right.  Some instant feedback coming in.  Uh, and it's coming in from all over the country.  Warren from Connecticut writes,  If Boston represents at the game like this contest, the Rams will win 44 to nothing.  Oh, stop.  Sean from Boston.  Hey, looks like Boston is finally representing, huh? 
[00:05:00]  What exactly is representing with?  I'm not sure.  Rick from Cleveland.  Boston is representing in a big way.  Oh.  In a big way, Anthony.  Yeah.  And Wally from Staten Island writes,  Glad to see Ted Kennedy entered the Naughty Naughty Contest.  Oh, no.  Come on.  It's not that bad.  Well, let's see what Jim Norton thinks.  Jim?  The girl right there?  Yes.  Definitely.  What's wrong with her?  Ah, no.  Some guys, I'll just say some guys might consider her to be a little, a little wide, maybe. 
[00:05:30]  No, no, no.  No?  Well, maybe Chachi didn't go to the School of Photography like Rick did.  Yeah.  Maybe Chachi didn't get the right angles.  Those legs, look at that.  It's not bad at all.  You like that?  Yeah, look at the little red thong.  Yeah.  I'll tell you what the biggest problem is.  It's not.  It's not.  It's not a Naughty Naughty.  No.  Yeah.  No.  She's wearing a towel.  She's wearing bumper stickers and a Pat's jersey. 
[00:06:00]  Norton, what the F?  I got like almost $5.  I'm telling you, she's not that bad.  Oh, God.  He's squeezing.  She's not that bad.  He's tugging over there.  Well, Wally, writing in again here, Anthony.  Too bad the Boston Strangler didn't get to the contestant of the Naughty Naughty Contest.  Okay.  Someone from Delaware, Anthony.  Boston's first contestant blows. 
[00:06:30]  If that's what Boston's women look like, then I will never go there.  The WBCN put a bikini on a snowman just to get in the contest.  She is paler than Norton's mule bag.  Oh.  Joe C from Boston saying, Pat's shirt.  She should be wearing a Pat's uniform.  Frank from Brooklyn.  Why the F did Boston even bother?  Oh, God.  By the way, my mule bag is not pale.  It has a lot of red bumps on it. 
[00:07:00]  Scott says it loud and clear.  He wrote the F word.  He goes, F, this is our hope.  There you go.  Like a whole city rests on this one contestant.  That's right.  Doesn't look like any more ladies are showing up for the Naughty Naughty Contest in Boston.  Hopefully tomorrow when we broadcast.  She's not the only one getting abused because I won't give the number, but Trance from Philly  says, nice to see Penny Marshall getting involved with the contest. 
[00:07:30]  You'll have to figure that out yourself.  We have one of the contestants checking in.  Leanne.  All right.  What's up?  What's up, Leanne?  Listen, I'm disappointed with you guys.  What's the matter?  Because you didn't help me out.  You didn't put on the other pictures.  Like all the other broads have like three whole pages.  Well, first of all, what number are you?  Oh, my God.  I don't even know.  She's number 36.  Wow.  Leanne.  And she was a little annoyed that the pictures that she had picked were not the ones.  Oh, you with the butt shot that looks a little off. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  And that was brutal.  That wasn't even good.  That was terrible.  You know something?  I like these pictures of you.  Well, do you like the other ones?  Because the other ones are really good.  Like, I was so excited.  I was like, oh, my pictures kick ass.  Can I say that?  Oh, sure.  Okay.  And then I saw them and they looked brutal and so sad because I thought the other ones  were really good.  Like, we took really good ones.  All right.  Where are those?  And listen, about Boston.  Nobody should be bitching about Boston because she's the first one that had balls to go and 
[00:08:30]  do it.  There you go.  She's going to get the whole thing started.  She's got balls?  Hey, Leanne?  Yeah.  This is what we're going to do for you today.  We're going to find the rest of your pictures and we're going to button them up.  Yeah.  And then we're going to let the listeners decide if the new set of pictures are better  than the ones that are representing right now.  Exactly.  You guys are the best.  All right.  And listen, one more thing.  When are you guys coming to Buffalo?  Oh, wow.  I know you hate it, but you have to come here.  Well, I did three years.  Isn't that good enough?  No.  I'll come back for a visit, a little visit, a little prison visit. 
[00:09:00]  All right.  So listen, buddy.  We would love to go to Buffalo in, I don't know, in early spring probably.  That's cool.  I think we might do a little Cleveland Buffalo thing.  There you go.  A little Cleveland Buffalo tour.  Yeah.  Bing, boom.  Bing, boom.  All right, Leanne.  All right.  So listen, buddy.  I did the show.  You're telling me that my pictures are going to be up?  Hopefully sooner.  All right.  Thanks.  By the way, miss.  Yeah.  You have a very nice hiney.  Thanks.  You're welcome.  All right.  There you go.  Jim Norton will be in Buffalo soon.  That's an awkward moment.  Thanks.  You have a mule.  You have a mule. 
[00:09:30]  You have a mule.  Enigma for Boston.  What happened?  Oh.  They didn't have one of those bus-sized wow stickers to put on her?  Oh.  Jesus.  Some guy from New York writes, Boston's listeners seem to be huge fans.  And Mike from Boston is saying, I think she counts as three contestants.  Super Bowl tickets are safe.  And we said we were going to rip up the tickets yesterday if we didn't get three entries.  Boston, you should be embarrassed today.  From Boston.  No offense to that lady, but Boston, you should be embarrassed today. 
[00:10:00]  Mm-hmm.  That lady's not a-  Not a whole country can see what you got.  This is it.  This is what you got.  This is what you got for the contest.  Dude, she's got good hips.  I'm telling you.  Chachi, I know Chachi is listening in that great office of his.  You're a liar.  You lie with the best of them.  Remember what he was saying yesterday?  Yeah, man.  He's right.  You hold those hips, just bow.  Mm-hmm.  Spank her.  All right, let's go to Glenn.  Glenn, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:10:30]  We're going to smoke them tomorrow.  We're going to smoke them.  We got the best Boston babes in their naughty 90s coming out, and we're going to show you  yam bags in New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Boston.  What?  Boston.  What?  Boston.  In the end, it's Boston.  And you know what to do?  We want you to rip the tickets up, but we want you to send them out to the Boston Common 
[00:11:00]  for one hour with the men from Boston.  All right, are you bringing girls by tomorrow?  Three of them.  Three tomorrow or today?  You are.  Just myself, I'm bringing three, and that's just one Boston.  What?  Boston.  What?  Boston.  What?  Are you the girl in the pictures we just saw?  All right, there you go.  So I guess we'll have more girls showing up tomorrow when we're up in Boston live.  No, hey, quiet.  Linda, what's going on? 
[00:11:30]  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, that chick from Boston that went down there, her boyfriend made her do it because  he wants those tickets.  Oh, yeah?  He wanted to make sure there was three representing Boston so you don't tear them up.  Ah, that joke just came out, didn't it?  Now you feel a little silly.  I have a secret message.  A secret message about the Penny Marshall thing from earlier to Jay from Boston.  Jay from Boston.  You are correct. 
[00:12:00]  Sir.  I love that game.  All right.  People play along at home.  Hey, Jack.  What's up?  Hey.  I've been listening to you guys for a little while now.  And I got to say, man, between your subject matter and your guess.  What would that be, sir?  Yes?  Jack.  Clones.  Hey, Jack.  Was that supposed to get to us?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  It seems it did, huh?  No, it didn't.  Oh, really, Jack?  Jack, let me tell you something.  We used to have hundreds of people like you, and now we only have one or two. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  One or two calls.  Keep listening there, Jack.  Keep listening.  Oh, my God.  1989, maybe.  It might have been relevant and cool and fun.  How obsessed do you have to be?  If this show sucks so bad, just don't listen.  Just don't listen.  He's listening every day.  Thank you.  Hey, Claude.  Remember we used to have hundreds of those?  Well, back in the day.  You know, 1989, 90. 
[00:13:00]  Forget about it.  You'd be brutalized.  Just ain't like that anymore, Jack.  John, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to say, talk about a Boston Massacre, huh?  And number 21 is to O&A as 9-11 is to New York.  Very good, John.  All right.  Later, guys.  All right.  Let's talk to Doug from Springfield.  What's up, Doug?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  See you again last night?  Well, yeah, on TV.  That was like the 1979, 80 years again. 
[00:13:30]  But let me ask you a question.  What do you people from Long Island have to go to the garden?  Do you people have any brains?  You do not go to the garden.  We kicked your ass last night.  No, no, no.  Listen, listen.  On the scoreboard.  Absolutely.  I'm not saying that.  I'll be the first to admit that the Islanders do not have any fighters on the team.  No, we're not even saying that.  When Yashin starts throwing punches, I know we're in trouble.  But we do have Cummins now that is doing okay.  He was bloodied.  There was this one guy that had an Islander jersey on, but use your brains.  You're making fun of Ranger fans who don't have, you know, that were pissed off last night. 
[00:14:00]  He got hit with about three beers at one time.  You don't think we take care of the Ranger fans at the Coliseum?  Absolutely not.  I've been there many times.  Come on.  You don't know.  No.  You guys don't know?  I've been there before.  It's like a little farm out there.  You don't know.  It's like a petting zoo.  Simple as that.  You don't know.  I've been there, Opie.  And you're saying, no, you haven't been to an Islander Ranger game at the Coliseum.  If you don't go to New York and talk to the Ranger fans.  Things don't change.  It's absolutely like going to Shea and Yankee Stadium when there's a Met Yankee game. 
[00:14:30]  Same goddamn thing.  The Long Island Petting Zoo.  The National Muzzlea.  Petting Zoo.  That's all.  The National Muzzlea.  Doug, you're that pissed that we beat you last time.  No.  No.  But I was more appealed at the Islander fans.  We kicked your ass.  You guys got bitch slapped all the way back to Farmingdale or whatever, Losingdale, you  guys.  Take your ass.  Come on, Opie.  You mean to tell me no Islander was tough enough to take on Theo Flurry after he stole  his stick?  Opie, Eric Orange is the biggest opusa I've ever seen in my life. 
[00:15:00]  Theo Flurry is going to get his by the end of the year.  I hate the guy.  I mean, if he's on your team, you've got to love him.  But if he's not on your team, you've got to hate him.  The Rangers asked the Islanders until they made them love him in the fights last night.  Whatever.  We won.  We won on the ice.  Oh, wow.  We're winning.  We're ahead of you.  We're a good team.  And it's driving you nuts.  Doug doesn't really have an argument here.  Doug doesn't really have an argument here.  You know what's going to happen in this season?  I'm just saying, Islander fans, use your brains.  You don't come to the garden.  Doug doesn't really have an argument there if, you know, the Rangers lost. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, yeah.  They lost the game.  Who cares?  The fights were great, though.  It was a lot of fun to watch.  Man.  Sandy McCarthy is just, we've got our asses kicked.  That guy is a chromosome short.  We're trying to get some bruisers.  Don't worry.  Give us some time.  Oh, boy.  Frank from Manhattan says, we all know a camera adds 10 pounds, but how many cameras was Chachi  using?  Albert, what's going on?  Oh, and hey.  What's happening, man?  Hey.  Hey, look.  Y'all are catching on down here in D.C., man. 
[00:16:00]  You're doing good.  Keep up the good work.  Check it out.  Yeah.  The girl that's a little thick in the middle, it's all good.  You've got to leave something for the brothers.  You know what I'm saying?  Oh, yeah.  You're liking that?  Right, man.  Because, you know, the brothers don't like them all skinny and bony and scrawny.  You know, that's for the case.  But, you know, the brothers like them a little thick.  I agree, sir.  I agree with you.  Because D.C. is chocolate city, so you've got to leave something on the map for us.  And D.C. has got three contestants, and they're all fine.  Yeah.  Right on, man.  So, hey, guys, keep up the good work, yeah?  All right, Albert.  Thank you. 
[00:16:30]  Thanks for the support, man.  The early support.  Yeah, I've seen a lot of the white women that the brothers like.  She would fit that bill.  You know what I mean?  Sort of the lightish hair thing, the big body.  The brothers do like that.  I think you're an insult in the hood, Anthony.  No, the brothers like that.  Do you want to talk to some brothers that they can check out her picture?  You will absolutely find some brothers that would.  I think every brother out there wants that.  I'm not saying every brother, but when you're looking for white women, that's what it is.  That's what they kind of like. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, he wants to talk to the brothers, as he puts it.  The brothers.  The brothers.  I've seen a lot of couples with a black guy and a white woman look just like this at the  laundromat and whatnot, you know?  At the laundromat, pulling it out.  They've got the little halfling children running around.  Sure.  What?  Did I say something?  It's true.  Either one employed.  Well, they've got to get changed for the laundromat somehow.  Yeah.  Wow.  This is the feedback. 
[00:17:30]  It's coming in like crazy.  We can't even keep up with it.  Dan from Hoboken.  I guess he's got a movie to go to tonight, so he's going to hang with us today.  Dan from Hoboken writes, don't you wish WBCN used a secret room to hide number 44?  Oh.  And Mike from Boston writes, I get it.  She thought she was there for the chowder bowl.  Michelle, what's going on?  Hi.  I'm one of the contestants.  Well, I'm going to be one of the contestants.  I was going to come down tomorrow in Boston.  Oh, nice.  Oh, good.  Well, the thing that worries me is all the feedback that you're getting on number 44. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, look.  It's good.  We're ruining it.  I haven't had a chance to see it.  I'm not updated yet.  I just tried to get on there.  Yeah.  And I'm up to like, I think, 33 Daphne or something like that.  Okay.  But anyways, I haven't gotten a chance to see her.  So I'm kind of like trying to figure out what she was wearing.  And I'm just getting a little nervous.  Well, I think she's getting more.  60 extra pounds.  I think she's getting abused because it's not even a naughty nighty.  Yeah.  It's bumper stickers and like a Patriots jersey.  Like I said, I didn't get a chance to look at the picture. 
[00:18:30]  So I really don't know what she was wearing.  I think you'll be fine tomorrow.  We don't want to scare off the ladies.  We need a lot of ladies to show up right.  We're live in Boston tomorrow.  Well, I've been listening to you guys.  And I said before, I said, oh, yeah, I'm going to do it.  And then I put it off and I put it off.  And I said, and I've just been listening lately a lot.  And I've been listening to the feedback and everything.  And I'm looking at it myself.  I'm like, I could do that.  Cool.  Then come on down.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Definitely.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  Bye.  Johnny wants to make an excuse for the whole city of Boston.  All right.  Johnny. 
[00:19:00]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  You know what happens?  It seems like somewhere around here, you can walk around even in the financial district down here.  You need a chin strap to hold your jar up.  But in the winter, they all seem to go away.  Either that or they just tend to pack on the pounds.  They just don't look as good.  I know that's what it is.  You're trying to say the Boston ladies hibernate?  Yeah.  They definitely hibernate or something.  Where are they?  Somewhere in South Carolina?  I don't know.  I don't know about South Carolina, but down there, it looks like nasty pigs down there.  Did you see your representation, Johnny?  I didn't get to see it before.  I'm going to rub this in all day long. 
[00:19:30]  I can just imagine it.  I can just imagine it because I've seen some of the girls around here lately.  And it's frankly making me sick to my stomach.  I need to get out of here.  All right, Johnny.  Thank you.  Bye.  Lord rules.  Thank you.  And, dude, to be honest, I mean, I've seen the hottest girls in the country are in Phoenix.  But I've seen it.  Absolutely.  Without a doubt.  But I've seen very few hot girls in Boston.  Well, we can be on in Phoenix.  I'm not saying that they're not in Boston, but I have not.  Even the gigs I've done up there over the years.  Yeah, I've never seen a whole lot of hot girls in Boston.  Wow.  Boston.  I'm not saying they're not out there.  I'm just telling you what I've seen.  They're crazy.  I'm not saying they're ugly. 
[00:20:00]  I'm just telling you.  Because they're the studious ones.  Go drive by BU.  You need the hot sluts.  Drive by BU, bro.  All right, look.  Get a hold of yourself.  I'm just telling you.  Go get the F truck.  Is it called the F bus or the F truck?  The uck truck.  The uck truck.  And then park it outside BU.  And then we'll fill that studio tomorrow with real hotties.  Some of the hottest girls in the country are on Com Ave outside the GSU at BU.  Unreal.  I'm not saying that there's not hot girls out there.  I just have not seen a tremendous amount of that.  That's all I'm saying.  Well, look where you hang out when you go up there. 
[00:20:30]  Insane.  I've seen a few attractive trannies, but I'm just saying I haven't seen a whole lot of hot girls.  No, you know where all the hot girls in Massachusetts hang out?  In Ashland, where I live.  That's where the bevy of beauties were.  You come stumbling out of Green Acres Bar over there three in the morning or two, whenever the hell it closed.  That nice townie bar.  Oh, my God.  Forget about it.  The girls from the projects come over.  There used to be guys that would just be thrown through the plate glass. 
[00:21:00]  Yes, every Friday night.  They had them South American girls that would come in there for a drink or two.  You know those girls that you see and they all look exactly the same?  They got that same face.  Like they got part Mayan Indian in them or something.  Yeah, they're called maids.  They're like Aztecs.  Yeah, the maids.  They're the same ones when you open the door after you hear,  Oh, skeepy!  Oh, skeepy!  They're short.  They look like they should be wearing those derby hats carrying the baby on their back.  Tobacco leaves.  They got the big cheek.  Well, you know the girls I'm talking about. 
[00:21:30]  All right.  Get those.  All right.  Just so hot.  Well, we got a brother checking in, Anthony.  Yo, B.  Big Mike.  Yo, what's the deal, man?  What's up, man?  No, man.  I'm from Brooklyn.  I'm talking about that punk from D.C.  Talking about all brothers like thick, real thick chicks.  Not me, bro.  I want me a nice, slim goodie, man.  You know?  You like that slim goodie.  Slim goodie.  A nice, slim goodie.  So you can split them in half.  You know, I saw Candy, right?  That's the chick with the blonde hair. 
[00:22:00]  You know, she got a little, you know, she's all right.  I hit it from the back so I won't see it.  But, you know, you know what I'm saying, man?  That's that candy chick?  Huh?  That's that candy chick you're talking about.  Yeah, yeah.  Let me take a look at her.  My man talking about all brothers like big chicks.  Nah, I want me a slim goodie, man.  Because when I put my car in the garage, I want them to feel it.  You know?  Let me see Candy.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you like that backdoor action there on Candy. 
[00:22:30]  That's right.  That's right.  Hit it from the back.  You know what?  You hit it from the back real good.  They're going to always come back to you, bro.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I'll have to remember that.  All right, man.  Take it easy, man.  Take mic.  You're all right, man.  All right.  A slim goodie.  A slim goodie.  You're right.  Brooklyn representing.  Well, let's go to Matthew.  Matthew, what's going on?  Yes?  You're on the radio, Matthew.  Yeah, man.  Forget about Boston team.  We need to throw her back into the Boston Bay. 
[00:23:00]  Oh.  Or Harbor.  Huh?  Bay Harbor, whatever.  Yeah, whatever.  All right.  Good job, Matthew.  Take it easy.  Bye.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  Mary Jo, very pissed off.  She got yanked from the contest.  Why?  Oh.  Mary Jo.  Hi, what's up?  What's up?  Norton.  Hi, Mary Jo.  Hi, Opie.  Yeah.  Hi.  Hello.  Hello, Anthony.  Hello.  How are you?  Hello.  Where are you from, Mary Jo?  What's up?  Where are you from?  Philly. 
[00:23:30]  Which one were you in Philly?  Huh?  I'm trying to remember which one you were in Philly.  This was one of the last ones that came in.  Yeah, I kind of remember.  One of the last ones that came in, yeah.  Oh, the brunette?  Yeah.  And why did they take your pictures down?  They didn't take my ID.  They copied my ID.  So why don't you go right back down to the station?  No, because you guys aren't there.  Like, the only reason why I did it was to see you guys.  So I already got my prize.  My prize was to see you guys and I saw you guys.  But you would have been a finalist in this contest.  What?  You would have been a finalist in this contest. 
[00:24:00]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I got my prize.  I got my prize.  I saw you guys.  You guys are awesome.  Not that Rolling Stones crap that Opie hit with the sledgehammer and broke.  This is a game.  This is a playing pinball machine.  Not this collector's item groovy crap.  Where's the mallet?  No way.  Don't even joke.  I will throw myself in front of that machine before any harm comes to it.  Love this one.  Get this CPU.  And they put this special chip in there that it curses at you. 
[00:24:30]  It's the R-rated chip.  So Arnold will say F you and stuff.  Very cool.  Can I make believe that the machine is Theo Fleury?  No, no.  This is a very good machine to play.  The Stones ones suck to play.  Yeah, classic.  Ooh, collect design.  This one, a playing game.  All right.  A little sexy Mary Jo calls about her pictures being taken off and then everybody goes to pinball.  I don't get it, guys.  She was hot.  She was hot.  What are we going to do? 
[00:25:00]  We've got a radio show to do.  All right.  You've got to stop robbing it.  Oh, God.  He just...  Oh, God.  Is he...  Anthony, on the show today.  Jay Moore calling in from New Orleans.  Also, we've got the Tyson audio.  Rocky on Broadway.  Clinton goes wild.  A lot of people calling the FU line.  Why don't we do all the details for our trip to Boston?  Oh, yeah.  We've got the chowder bowl going down tomorrow.  Oh, you're going to love it.  And we'll have the details next, okay?  Right.  Hey, this is Dennis Leary here.  I listen to the Opie and Anthony.  Hey, this is Dennis Leary here. 
[00:25:30]  I listen to the Opie and Anthony.  Hey, this is Dennis Leary here, and I listen to the Opie and Anthony show every day.  Yeah, right.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  That game rocks so much.  I was on my first ball for the whole time.  Dude, I'm rocking.  I will have high score.  You were playing with a ball?  I was playing T2.  Oh, T2, the pinball game.  New, old pinball game.  This is a good pinball game. 
[00:26:00]  We'll have some contests now.  Do you remember the guys from ClassicPinball.com, Opie?  Yeah, I do.  Do you remember?  Because they had a Rolling Stones pinball machine that was brought down here, and you smashed it.  Well, yeah.  But this machine is too cold to smash.  Very cold.  Lots of instant feedback coming in here.  It continues.  Yeah.  The Boston Massacre continues. 
[00:26:30]  Chris from Washington writes,  It's not often you get to see a Patriots lineman in a Naughty Nighty.  Oh.  Hey, Boston, you did it to yourselves, man.  You know what?  I'm kind of proud that Boston's finally representing in the Naughty Nighty contest, Anthony.  Are you?  And I want to make sure everyone checks out the latest contestant in the Naughty Nighty contest on OpieandAnthony.com.  It took almost two weeks to get some representation from Boston, but finally we got one. 
[00:27:00]  Yes.  And our pictures are up.  Check them out for yourself.  There you go, Boston.  Thank you, Boston.  Thank you.  Mark from Boston writes,  I hope Chachi gets hazard pay.  We are heading up to Boston tomorrow.  Yes, we are.  The Chowder Bowl.  Yep.  We got to explain the Chowder Bowl once again.  First of all, pretty much just like every other radio show in America, we have a pair of Super Bowl tickets. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  And we're going to have fun with our pair.  Yeah.  What's different about our pair of Super Bowl tickets?  We don't have a way to get you there and we don't have a place for you to stay.  Right.  So we're always a little bit different.  There's no hotel.  There's no airfare.  No airline.  Nothing.  You have to get there yourself.  You have to find somewhere to sleep.  And there are radio shows in Akron, Ohio.  Uh-huh.  Small, tiny, little towns like Akron, Ohio. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That have Super Bowl tickets to give away and it's a full package.  How did we not get the whole...  A full weekend of fun and debauchery.  How did that happen?  How did we not get the trip and everything?  It's us.  We suck.  God, we do.  We really suck.  We can't do anything right.  We're like a huge...  We don't have a format for our show.  Then what happens, Anthony?  Oh, this is where it just heats up and gets great.  This is great.  We have 40 gallons.  I believe 40 gallons of delicious clam chowder. 
[00:28:30]  Can I interrupt?  Oh, sure.  I think we're getting a little too big.  What do you mean?  With this syndication thing.  Why?  You know when I was doing that analogy about the Super Bowl and stuff?  Yeah.  And I kind of just pulled Akron, Ohio out of the air?  Uh-huh.  I didn't know we're on in Akron, Ohio.  Akron.  I hope it's not part of the Cleveland market.  Hello, Akron.  So now they're really pissed at us.  Why can't I say Des Moines, Iowa?  Hey, Josh.  Josh.  What's up?  Nothing much. 
[00:29:00]  I'm just from Akron.  We are the Cleveland.  Oh, man.  We're getting it from 92.3.  All right.  We love Cleveland, too.  We don't want to piss off Cleveland.  Don't piss off Akron.  We love Akron.  God, why didn't I say Des Moines?  Hey, don't you guys make tires there?  Someone give me a map.  We used to.  You used to make tires.  Right.  See, Opie?  All right.  We love Akron.  We love Akron, Ohio.  We're actually just south of Cleveland.  All right.  No, I should have known that, actually. 
[00:29:30]  Ixnay on the Akron, yay.  All right.  A lot of people from Akron calling up.  Well, it's good to know you guys are listening to us.  Thanks.  All right.  Bye, Josh.  Bye.  In an area with a lot of hot girls.  Right.  Boston has a lot of hot ones, too.  The beautiful women of Akron.  Girls in Boston are smoking.  I'll take your word for it.  Norton doesn't appreciate the Boston girls.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm not saying they're all pigs.  I just have not seen all the chicks up there.  Well, they're not hanging out in the old combat zone there, Jimmy. 
[00:30:00]  What's the old combat zone?  Where all the peep shows and all the sex shops used to be.  Yeah.  Back in the good old days.  How far is that from this end?  They pretty much cleaned up that area.  Unfortunately.  They're not hanging out at the Ramrod, Jimmy.  Hey, hey.  Ramrod.  Take a walk down Com Ave someday.  Anyway, go ahead, Ian.  Oh, right.  We have 40 gallons.  We're going to have 40 gallons.  So the 10 contestants at this point are now in the studio tomorrow. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  Legal Seafood giving us 40 gallons of creamy, chunky clam chow.  That's just a start, by the way.  Yeah, that's just a start.  We were talking to the gang in Boston.  They're on standby.  Oh, of course.  Standby.  We could need a lot more.  With the engine running if we need more.  What these guys will do.  And girls.  And girls.  Absolutely.  They have to eat a nice big bowl of clam chowder every 10 minutes.  I'll tell you.  Explain that.  It just sounds so tasty.  You forgot the word creamy. 
[00:31:00]  Creamy, chunky, clammy chowder.  Good, thick.  I've had the clam chowder at Legal Seafood.  Delish.  Very good.  Delish.  Very good.  You know why I like it so much?  Sometimes you get clam chowder.  What's wrong with it?  It's thin and soupy and watery.  Legal Seafood.  Creamy, thick, filling, rich.  Robust, might I say.  And they will be eating a big bowl of this every 10 minutes.  You puke, you're out. 
[00:31:30]  So, the last person to puke will go to the Super Bowl.  Right.  There you go.  Will there be anything else in the clam chowder?  Well, we are still throwing this around.  I don't think we should do this at all.  It's ruining beautiful clam chowder.  We still have Stalker Patty's toenails.  from when a podiatrist had to come down and snip them  because she couldn't do it herself. 
[00:32:00]  She needed surgical tools to cut off what amounted to ram horns on her feet.  Hey, man.  You drop that into a 40-gallon pot of chowder.  Who's going to know?  You never know.  It's like the old days when they used to have the military firing squads.  They'd put the clips all in a big barrel.  And you'd walk by and grab a clip.  One of those clips had blanks in it.  You know why?  Because then everyone that was part of the firing squad 
[00:32:30]  would have that element of doubt in their head.  Well, maybe I had the blanks.  Maybe I didn't kill the guy.  Because it's, you know, one of your own guys you're killing.  So if you drop one toenail in that chowder,  there's that element of doubt.  Maybe I didn't get it.  And we'll say right now we're not going to put the toenails in.  Yeah.  You don't know for sure.  There are ten toenails.  All right.  So you said the last guy that pukes won't get the tickets. 
[00:33:00]  Yes, last guy puke, get tickets.  Oh, man.  This seems to be a little, a new problem as far as our contest goes.  What, Akron?  Well, someone decided to do the math for us.  Brendan.  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  Hey, I was just looking at my atlas here.  It's 1,500 miles from Boston to New Orleans.  There's going to be some fast driving.  And not a flight to be had.  That's right.  They got 48 hours to get there.  That's something like 30 miles an hour.  Bound, down, beast, bound, down, loaded up and trucking. 
[00:33:30]  Hey, we've got some mathematicians that listen to this show.  All right, so it's 40.  Someone do some cute little math for us.  That's easy.  And we'll figure out other things like, you know, stopping for gas, taking leaks.  That's it.  They have like, no, you don't stop.  No, no.  You and your friend.  Dude, it's Boston, man.  That's all you do.  Get the radar detector going and you're set.  It's 48 hours, 1,500 miles.  It's like 30-ish.  31.25 miles per hour. 
[00:34:00]  Per hour?  Yeah.  So it's totally doable.  Totally doable.  So you do twice that speed.  You get there half the time.  You know, you might want to pack your bags before you show up at the station tomorrow.  That's it.  Uh-huh.  You're going to be sick to your stomach from all that creamy, creamy chowder.  Chunky New England clam chowder.  Oh, my God.  Imagine what that bowl is going to look like up there.  That's going to be where the real bowl...  And then you're going to have to jump in your ride and drive.  So all the hard-hitting action is going to take place in the toilet bowl that the guy is sitting on once he gets down there. 
[00:34:30]  That's it.  Anyway, thanks, boys.  Norton rules.  All right, brother.  See?  Remember Smoke and the Bandit?  They didn't have much time at all.  Well, they have 24 hours to get the Coors beer from there.  Are we going to do what they say?  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, we've got a long way to go.  Yeah, yeah.  They ought to go to Texark County to Georgia.  All right.  That's kind of comparable, East West.  And they did it. 
[00:35:00]  All you need is a Trans Am.  And you've got to watch out for a few for key justice.  Trans Am in a bad way.  What we're dealing with here is a complete lack of respect for the law.  Oh, that's an attention getter.  Thank you, nice lady.  Nice ass.  Daddy?  What?  Did I get a Hush Puppies?  We ain't got time for that crap.  Give me a Diablo sandwich and a Dr. Pepper. 
[00:35:30]  Make it snappy.  I'm in a goddamn hurry.  Kidnapping.  Kidnapping is baby crap.  You can't do what this dude's doing.  Driving through people's backyards, knocking down mailboxes.  I'm going to go home and slap your mom.  Oscar, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Listen, this contest is getting better and better every second.  What's next?  We'll find out that the guy who wins has to go and sell hot dogs around the stadium. 
[00:36:00]  We wouldn't be surprised.  You're going to call him up.  I bet this is going to happen.  You call him up ten seconds before he enters the stadium and say, listen, after the game,  you've got to go into the locker room and give consolation hummers to the losers while  you're getting the A from the winner.  It's not that bad.  We wouldn't have it any other way, though, Oscar.  You know that.  You've been with us a long time.  Hey, I'll take the tickets, even if I have to give a hummer.  Ant and I dream of a day when we could do some really great things with this radio show.  Yeah.  Like, put on a great concert, like a wow stock, or maybe have Super Bowl tickets where we actually 
[00:36:30]  have a flight and a hotel room for the winner.  Someday, my friends.  Someday.  I made it from Long Island, New York, to San Juan Capistrano, California, exactly 48 hours.  So it can absolutely be done.  And there probably won't be any traffic in New Orleans.  Oh, that's true.  Fly right in.  Oh, boy. 
[00:37:00]  Tim, what's going on?  What's going on over there?  Hey.  Keep your chin off.  Hey, representants, did they count us out?  I just like to count out the Patriots, man.  Well, we look forward for tomorrow to see what Boston has for us.  You know, some of those girls from Washington there, man, they need to hose down the studio  after.  I thought the girls from Washington were fine.  Oh, yeah.  Well, there's a couple towards the end there.  I like a bunch of the girls from Cleveland, too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:37:30]  Absolutely.  And New York, well, what can I tell you?  Yeah.  And hey, Norton, man, who cares?  They're all yellow when you see them.  They're all what?  All yellow.  Hey, Norton, you're real.  Thank you, buddy.  All right.  Man.  Let's go to Jeremy.  Jeremy, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  What up?  Hey, I just want to make a comment.  I'm from Sacramento.  All right.  I just want to make a quick little comment about whatever that was that came in for your  contest.  Oh, that's representing Sacramento?  Yeah.  What is that?  What number? 
[00:38:00]  There's a lot of controversy with the Sacramento girl.  Some people claiming that she may be a guy.  I think she might be.  Wait a minute.  We'll swear to God.  What number?  And more than one person has emailed with that.  Can I ask a favor of Scott, who does the website?  Maybe put the city they're in on the actual link, like Contestant 7 from wherever, you  know?  That way, because when I hear the contestants from Sacramento, I'm looking like, I don't  know who it is. 
[00:38:30]  What number is it, sir?  I think it's like 34.  34.  Let me see.  That's Sacramento.  It's down towards that girl that Jordan liked yesterday.  Now, the first picture, she looks real hot.  Second picture, she has her hand strategically placed in front of her crotch.  Okay.  Well, look at that.  Now, picture four redeems everything.  You want to tell me that's a guy?  That's because you can't see her face.  That's why.  Well, you know... 
[00:39:00]  I think she was in that Kevin Costner movie, that...  She's a chick.  That Indian movie there, that...  What, Dancing with Wolves?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah?  She was the one running with Kevin Costner?  There you go.  I like that, Jimmy.  Yeah, I like that.  That's a chick, and if it's a guy, look, can you keep a secret?  I don't think it's a guy.  I got a few emails saying, hey, man.  Some features there that are...  She's got junk.  She probably works out a lot, but no, you can keep it by that picture.  She's beautiful, actually.  No, there's nothing there.  There'd be a yam bag sticking out. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Jeremy, you know, that's the girl representing Sacramento.  I know, and I hate to...  That's what you're putting all your hopes on right there.  That's the girl you're putting all your hopes on.  Yeah, that sucks.  Hey, don't complain.  Go see what Boston is representing with.  I've already seen that, and a couple of them from Cleveland look a lot better with bruises.  All right, Jeremy.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  Dude, you can tell by looking at the panties that there's no mouth-watering helmets poking through. 
[00:40:00]  It's mouth-watering.  Don from East Meadows saying that the Boston entry is a lot like the clam chowder.  White, thick, chunky, with a wonderful fishy aroma.  Oh, very good.  Don from East Meadows.  All right.  Well, so we're looking for a bunch of guys that think they have what it takes to hold in this creamy, thick, wonderful, luscious clam chowder. 
[00:40:30]  Thick, clammy.  Can you use the word chunky?  Chunky.  It is chunky.  All right, get your thoughts together.  Yeah.  It's got to go.  The clam chowder.  Yeah, go ahead.  It's a thick, creamy, chunky, delicious, hearty clam chowder.  Savory.  Savory, hearty, thick, and creamy.  Big chunks of potato, clam, all in a wonderful, creamy sauce. 
[00:41:00]  Buttery.  Buttery?  Sometimes you see the butter kind of floating on top a little bit.  All right.  A little grease.  All right.  Take a little of that butter grease.  Mm-mm.  Not just a soup.  It's a meal.  Yes.  Take care of the whole thing.  All right.  Bill's going to help us out with the trip from Boston to New Orleans.  Bill?  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  Yeah.  Twenty-eight hours.  Twenty-eight hours?  Twenty-eight hours.  Twenty-eight hours. 
[00:41:30]  That's it.  Do it at 70 miles an hour.  Stop it three times and take a dump.  So, okay.  So, the person will win the tickets tomorrow afternoon by seven.  They can go home, take a little break, leave six, seven Saturday morning.  They'll have plenty of time.  Plenty of time.  I'll leave a volunteer to drive them down there for a ticket.  All right, Bill.  Thank you.  And it shouldn't be who pukes last.  It should be who doesn't pukes, right?  Everyone else pukes, you win.  Well, that's just it.  If everyone else pukes, you're the last guy, you win.  You're right.  But you know what?  I think we might make that last guy puke just for the hell of a day. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  Just to see what comes out.  All right.  Hey, thank you, Bill.  We found our bit today.  Jill, what's up?  Hi, guys.  Hey.  I am driving home, and I'm listening to the clam chowder event, and it's making me so sick.  What's the problem?  My throat.  It's disgusting.  Clam chowder.  Then, Jill, what these guys are going to do, picture big restaurant deep soup bowls.  Right to the tippy top, we're just going to fill it up. 
[00:42:30]  Just fill it up until the bowl actually has a very good weight to it.  Like, you pick it up and go, wow, there is a lot of thick, creamy, chunky clam chowder here in my hands.  And they have to then eat it all, eat that whole bowl right down to the bottom.  Want to see your face in the bottom?  Get a good one.  Get a good one.  Right down to the bottom.  That wonderful, thick, creamy, luscious, clammy clam chowder.  And after they're done, let's say it took them eight, nine minutes to polish off that wonderful bowl of clam chowder. 
[00:43:00]  They have about two minutes to recoup.  And there it is.  Ladle out.  Big ladle of thick, heavy, creamy, chunky clam chowder.  Just a nice big dollop right there in that bowl to scoop up and start eating again.  Bowl number two.  Who knows how many you're going to have to finish?  And let's say that one, it might take a little longer. 
[00:43:30]  Let's say that takes you nine and a half minutes.  You have 30 seconds to settle it down, get your senses about you, until here it comes, another dripping ladle full of creamy, thick, chunky, clammy chowder to be enjoyed.  Perhaps that's the one with the toenail in it.  That'll be over the top.  Yes.  By the fourth bowl, I think it's going to start coagulating.  Oh.  Whatever it's called.  Coagulation will take place.  Coagulation will take place.  Coagulation. 
[00:44:00]  All of that.  Maybe by that time.  It's like a pie in the cereal box.  Maybe because if you're not eating it fast enough, that thin film will form on the top.  When you put your spoon in, it crinkles and wrinkles around the whole top like a pudding skin.  Like thick pudding skin over the top.  Add into the contest, the smell of puke in the air from the first contestant.  Yeah.  Eventually, someone's going to puke sooner than later, I think, which will then fill the air with not only that wonderful, thick, very aromatic smell of clam chowder, but vomit. 
[00:44:30]  Vomit fills the air as you ladle out yet another bowl full.  I do believe the vomit will be permeating the air.  Yeah.  And you know, clam chowder, a food that I don't think, it's not like a steak or a burger where you really chew it good before you swallow it.  You really just let it wash in your mouth a bit and then just swallow it down.  Very chunky. 
[00:45:00]  Maybe chase it with the Sam Adams.  Ah, sure.  Is Jim Cook stopping by?  So when you boof this up, when this just comes projectile vomiting out of your mouth, it's just as creamy and chunky and clammy as when it went down there, Jill.  And savory.  Savory.  Mm-mm.  Just as good on the way up.  I can just picture the taste.  With just a little difference in the coloring due to the bile and stomach acids. 
[00:45:30]  Right.  A little more of a beige.  That messed together so well with it.  To light brown tone as it passes over the other side of your teeth into the awaiting vomit buckets we have set up all around the studio.  Yeah, we're grown men, I know.  I just can't wait.  All right, Jill.  Bye.  Bye.  Well, Bobby.  Rob from New York saying enough already.  Bobby.  All right, enough.  Bobby Bigrigger. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, hey, what's going on?  First of all, you've got to figure an average of 50 miles an hour and put you there in 30 hours.  Right.  But anyway, I've never had clam chowder.  Oh.  I know Julia Child.  She usually whips up a pretty good dish.  Maybe if she was to explain it, I'd be able to understand.  The creamy, the sauce should be very viscous and thick.  And don't let it sit too long.  Film will develop over the top of it and it doesn't look very appetizing. 
[00:46:30]  When they've vomited up, here, now I'm adding the chunks of toenails.  Fungal toenails.  To add color.  Yes.  Wonderful clam chowder, bile, and stomach acid moronade.  Today on The French Chef.  Jay, what's up?  What's going on, boys?  That's another local reference.  Just a quick question.  What happens if, you know, they only have 10 minutes in between bowls and you're filling this bowl up to the top? 
[00:47:00]  What happens when they're getting so sick that they just don't finish the bowl in the 10 minutes?  They're out!  I don't feel like a penalty, like, have to do a shot of tequila and everyone else has to wait while they do the shot and finish the bowl?  No, no, no.  This is key.  If you don't finish your bowl, I'm not talking about licking the bowl clean or anything.  Right.  We'll be the judge if you really finish the goddamn bowl of clam chowder.  No, 10 minutes.  That's it.  And then you've got to start on your second bowl.  So if it's 9 minutes 50 seconds and you've got some left at the bottom, you're going to go, jam it down. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, I can't.  Why?  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  How many bowls of clam chowder do you think it's going to take?  I am predicting right now, mark my words, the first guy pukes on his third bowl.  That's it.  It's milk-based.  How big are the bowls, though?  I'm thinking you're standard.  If Chachi's listening right now, it's got to be not the biggest bowl.  No, I don't want one of those flat-bottom bowls where it's very deceiving. 
[00:48:00]  I need a deep...  Cereal bowl.  Right.  Okay.  Cereal bowl.  But a good-sized one.  It's got to be good.  How many ounces would you say?  Like when you empty out one of those big cans of chunky soup.  Like that.  Wow, no.  What are you, insane?  We want the contest to last a little bit.  It'll last a little.  What are you showing me your ass for?  He's like going to pull his pants up. 
[00:48:30]  He turns around and I look his ass crack his head down.  Stan, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing, man?  Hey, bro.  Dude, I actually had clam chowder for lunch today, man.  And my face has turned like a really unpleasant shade of green.  Dude, I'd like you guys to stop, please.  It's going to be horrible enough listening to it tomorrow.  Was it creamy and chunky?  Oh, I've got to go.  All right, my dear.  All right, later. 
[00:49:00]  Hey, Dave, it's got a good point, too.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Is it going to be like a cold, like, you know, clam chowder?  I know it doesn't sound important, but...  No, it's very important.  I think the clam chowder is going to start off nice and hot.  Hyping hot.  Hyping hot.  Hyping hot.  But as the contest goes on, it's going to get colder.  Right.  And colder.  A little colder, and it's going to start coagulating, get a little thick, get a little  lumpy.  Oh, did you ever eat cold clam chowder?  It's the most disgusting vial thing. 
[00:49:30]  Who's not listening?  Get a good one.  Who's not listening tomorrow, man?  By the way, I have a response for that call at Jack that I called you in the beginning.  Yeah.  You know what?  Very good.  You're a reference of the day.  No, it's good.  That's another...  He can't accept that his hero is a fraud.  The current reference he's making there.  Let's go to Dustin, who's the board up in Sacramento.  Dustin, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, we got us another girl.  This is...  They were supposed to send the pictures off yesterday, but we sent them off today. 
[00:50:00]  And this is Anna.  You guys want to talk to her?  This will be the second girl representing the Naughty Nighty Contest out of Sacramento,  California, Anthony.  Yeah.  Hang on.  I'll let you guys talk to her.  Is she hot?  Yeah, she's very hot.  Don't lie like Chachi.  Dude, we've heard this from every single...  Look at these pictures.  Every girl...  Don't lie like Chachi.  Don't lie like Andy does every once in a while in Cleveland.  Yeah.  I told you the first girl was hot.  Was she hot?  Yes.  All right.  Here's Anna.  Hang on a second.  All right.  Hello?  Hello, Ann?  Anna.  Anna.  What makes you hot? 
[00:50:30]  Um, I don't know.  I have full lips and blue eyes and long eyelashes and...  And how's your face?  I don't know.  You'll have to see for yourself.  She's just described an aborigine also, which I don't find...  People tell me I look like Uma Thurman and Cameron Diaz and...  You also just described the volleyball in Castaway.  You guys are mean.  What's the matter if I remember what the volleyball was?  Wilson!  Wilson!  Wilson! 
[00:51:00]  Wilson!  Hey, uh, Anna.  Hey, what?  What do you look like as far as, uh, how does your body fill out that wonderful naughty  nighty?  That pungent naughty...  Oh, no, that's for the clam shot, right?  I mean, no, that lovely naughty nighty.  How does it fill it out?  Well, I have, um, 34D.  Oh!  And I am a 5'4", so...  Oh, certainly.  That gives you an idea.  All right.  What about the rest now, though?  The midsection and the buttock?  Um, I don't know.  So, I guess midsection, it's all right. 
[00:51:30]  Uh-oh.  Oh, all right?  It has a pause, but hey.  All right?  But hey, no one's perfect, right?  No.  Daniel!  Daniel!  I have a question for you.  I have a girl!  Oh, sorry, Anna, we're just entertaining ourselves.  Yes, question.  Okay, the girl from Washington that you guys are raving about...  Well, that's because she's topless.  We're pigs.  Yeah, but that's not fair.  It's a naughty contest.  Oh, no, no.  There...  You know what the rules are for this contest?  No.  None.  None more rules. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, but that means that she gets an edge, you know?  You know something?  If other girls want that edge, she has an asset here.  She definitely upped the ante in this contest.  And she used it.  But are you going to do something kind of see-through-ish or what?  Yeah, it's see-through.  See, I will be honest with you.  I like the see-through thing more than the just completely topless thing.  That's what I was thinking.  Leave it to the imagination, you know?  Yeah, you know something?  Don't let it all hang out.  My imagination is put my C between those T's and pumping.  Exactly.  That's how much imagination I want to use because this girl, Stephanie, from D.C. 
[00:52:30]  Look at this, Norton.  Look!  All right.  Yeah, she's hot, but she's topless.  Go back.  I want to see the thumb.  It's not fair.  That's okay.  Oh, just like, oh, some golden deliciousness.  Oh, Jim, I've been eating asparagus.  Ah!  Anna?  Yeah, so you guys need to go check out my pictures.  Anna, don't be scared by us.  Take the pictures, and I'm sure you're a great-looking lady.  They're already sent in.  All right, cool.  Well, we'll get them up on opiananthony.com soon, all right? 
[00:53:00]  Cool.  Thank you, guys.  All right, bye.  All right, bye.  One more call.  Jay Moore's on hold.  Jay Moore!  Tell Jay to hold through the break because we want to spend some time with him, all right?  Frank.  Hey, guys.  Real fast because we've got to take a break.  Okay, two things.  One, the word to get people to do what you want them to do is pungent.  The pungent odor of the clams, and you can go into the whole thing.  Pungent.  Pungent is the key word.  And these various pungent aromas will be wafting through the air.  There you go. 
[00:53:30]  I just don't want to confuse my words, so I shouldn't say lovely clam chowder.  I should say lovely naughty nighty.  Yeah, lovely naughty nighty.  Pungent clam chowder.  Right?  Pungent clam chowder.  There you go.  And the second thing is you know that Julia Child is not Italian when she goes,  we'll put a little bit of oregano.  Oregano in the marinaud.  If you watch her, the oldest show that used to be on TV, she used to get wrecked with the  wine when she was cooking.  Oh, yeah.  One time she was making tomato sauce and put her in a blender.  Yeah. 
[00:54:00]  When she never put the cap on, turned it on, she got blasted with tomatoes.  Oh, it's okay.  Look at the last one I had before menopause.  Oh, that made a fine marinaud.  All right, Frank.  Thank you.  I've watched those goddamn shows.  Like, you turn it on and go, wow, this bitch is old.  And then the show ends and it's like 1976 on the bottom.  She's already hunchbacked.  Closing Moodle, you.  Scott from Boston, what's up? 
[00:54:30]  You guys suck, man.  I was doing fine.  I'm driving in the worst traffic in freezing rain.  I was doing fine until you said pudding skin.  Then I'm hanging out the window, practically losing my all-beef calzone that I had for lunch.  You guys suck so bad.  When I was describing that, I was laughing so hard it hurt.  And then I started driving even, man.  The pudding skin thing just threw me right over the edge, man.  We might leave the clam chowder on the radiator.  Yeah, on the radiator. 
[00:55:00]  For a while.  Jesus Christ.  I got to go, man.  All right.  I just like the idea.  All right, Scott.  You know, they'll be lulled into this false sense of security when the first couple of bowls are piping hot and delicious, fresh.  And then as the day goes on and that broth, that lovely broth starts getting colder and starts solidifying, crystallizing on their spoons around the top.  You know, getting hard and cakey. 
[00:55:30]  Maybe some of those hard bits will break off in their mouth.  Kevin?  Kevin brings up a problem.  Let's see if we can work this out real fast.  Hello.  Kevin.  How are you doing, guys?  All right.  What's up?  I got something for you.  A lot of these people are going to leave without puking.  If they don't finish the bowl within 10 minutes, you're saying that they just fill it up again.  What's to stop somebody from just taking their time eating?  What?  No, they have to finish the bowl every 10 minutes if they want a shot at the Super Bowl table. 
[00:56:00]  Dude, if they don't finish the bowl, they're out.  Out.  Can I tell you?  So a lot of people are going to go out without puking.  Kevin, leave it to the experts.  Let me tell you what's going to happen here.  They're going to get the first three bowls down, no problem.  And then all of a sudden, nature's going to take its course.  And they're not going to be able to hold it back.  Yeah.  But a lot of people won't be able to finish that bowl within the 10 minutes.  No, you have not seen contestants in contests, sir.  We have, believe me, it's a feeding frenzy.  If they see that they're running out of time and they have some left, they will shovel it in so fast. 
[00:56:30]  That's why the bowls have to be a bit on the small side.  Okay.  Just so you can get the contest going, you know.  We'll go over bowl size.  Okay.  Yeah.  If you make the bowl too big and up to the tippy top, as you said, it might not be.  Right up to the tippy top.  Because they might not finish it and then no one's going to puke.  They'll be out before they get a chance.  They spill a little bit on their clothes trying to get it to their area.  Mike has a good idea.  Yeah.  And some of those nice oyster crackers along with it. 
[00:57:00]  Those dry oyster crackers.  And what if they spill it on the side?  What's the stopping them from knocking something off the top and spilling it on the side?  We will keep an eye and be the judge.  We might, then we'll just ladle a little more in.  That's like the word ladle.  We need a big ladle.  Big sloppy ladle.  Maybe like a, maybe one of those lunch ladies.  Yeah.  With the mole on her face.  With the big mole on her face.  Ladling out the hairnet. 
[00:57:30]  Big saggy arms.  She'll have the lunch lady arms.  Oh, that's great.  The sweaty B.O.  And the hairnet.  And the ladling out the clam chowder.  That big mole on her cheek with the hair.  Oh, God.  God damn, we need to find one for the bar.  Who's next?  Who's next?  How about if someone pukes up the toenail, they get an extra price?  Who's going to look for it, sir?  Thank you, Kevin.  I hope people are laughing as hard as I am. 
[00:58:00]  You know how that ladle, you know how encrusted that ladle's going to be after a while?  Line up, who's next?  Line up, who's next?  Got a big ladle full for you.  Just dip it in there.  You hear it scraping on the bottom of the pot.  Comes up, all drips off of the bottom.  You put your plate up here, don't want to lose any.  Put it over the pot.  Get a good one.  That'd be great.  I can't wait. 
[00:58:30]  I am so friggin' psyched for this contest.  You just want to know what happens if you crap yourself.  Oh, God.  Get a good one.  Big ladle full.  We should have done this contest with oatmeal.  I couldn't eat one bowl.  There you go.  All right.  Real fast, because we've got to move on to other things.  Who's ready for seconds?  We're going to get some contenders tomorrow, though. 
[00:59:00]  I'm telling you.  Oh, I know.  You know.  I've seen it.  You know we're going to get some guys that are going to take this very seriously.  Yes, Jim?  I just wanted to offer a suggestion.  I don't know if it's a possibility, but if somebody's worried about driving, is it possible  somebody could fly into a nearby state and rent a car?  So instead of driving 28 hours, you might have to drive six hours.  Wow.  Look at you.  Look at you.  Look at you.  I don't know what stage you're...  It'll be up to the winner.  But if people aren't going to come down and go, no, we'll never make it, you really can  book a discount flight. 
[00:59:30]  Yes.  A couple hundred bucks.  Thank you, Jim.  Thank you.  I wonder if there's any of those little grains of sand.  Do you ever have that in clam chowder?  And you bite down and...  It's gritty.  Very gritty.  Gritty.  A little sand.  What about that one clam that just doesn't seem to be quite right?  It's a little off.  A little off.  I think that clam was a little off.  Hey, all the other clams were nice and fresh.  What happened to this one?  A little piece and you hold it up in your spoon and it's slightly discolored.  Fun.  A little black on it.  Maybe it's got a rainbow tinge to it. 
[01:00:00]  Kind of looks like one of the contestants from Cleveland.  A little gamey.  And you notice as you're chewing that the clam is rubbery.  Oh, rubbery clam.  Rubbery clam.  You can't get it down.  You're chewing.  And chewing.  And chewing.  We'll look.  We'll look tomorrow and see if any of those circumstances come up.  Real fast.  Let's do the details again.  Because we're dead serious.  We got the Super Bowl tickets.  We don't have a way for you to get there.  We don't have a place for you to stay.  But I'm hearing that doesn't matter.  Okay?  Uh-huh.  You start, you know, showing up at the station before 3 o'clock. 
[01:00:30]  Right around 3 or shortly after.  By 3.30 at the latest.  We are going to pick numbers out of a hat.  See, if you show up at the station, we're going to give you a number.  Yeah.  We're going to have a lottery.  We're going to get our 10 contestants for the Chowder Bowl that way.  Right.  Okay?  So all you have to do if you're dead serious about winning tickets to the Super Bowl is  show up outside WBCN Studios tomorrow.  Mm-hmm.  Start showing up around 2 or so because we're going to be partying anyway before we go on  the air.  Okay?  And then around 3 to 3.30, you know, we'll have the lottery. 
[01:01:00]  Right.  To see who joins us for the show that day.  There you go.  It's all happening tomorrow as we broadcast live from Boston.  Jay Moore next.  We don't have time for the F.U. line.  We're so late.  Oh, God.  We'll check in with the F.U. line in a little bit.  Well, real quick.  Jersey Bob suggests getting Sandy Kane to ladle out this.  Thank you, no.  With her own clam hanging from her, uh...  We need a lunch lady with an industrial outfit.  Yeah, we do.  That would be great.  That would be hilarious. 
[01:01:30]  Maybe contestant number...  Oh, never mind.  Hey there, sweetie.  How old are you?  16.  18.  You're first.  Mom!  I like where this is going.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And he...  And we're back.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  We've got two girls that just showed up for the Naughty Nighty Contest here in New York.  Oh, really?  Two wild girls.  Very wild girls, right, Jimmy?  No, the girls outside now I haven't really spoken to. 
[01:02:00]  The wild ones, uh...  Limo Ant had to take back to get their IDs.  Wait, Limo Ant brought two and then there's another two out there?  So, oh, we got four today.  Yeah, but the other two he took back.  And I'm like, how old are you?  And she's just giggling.  Very...  Big, slob, old piece of, uh...  No.  Asshole, fossil.  No?  No, I'm 18.  You got a mole?  I have...  I actually have a little one on my face.  No, it's got to be a big mole with hair growing out of it. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, come on.  Do you have...  I'm coming by for the Naughty Nighty Contest.  Do you have flabby, uh, underarms with, uh, wrinkles and liver spots?  No, I'm a little.  Aw.  Um, what kind of slob are you?  Maybe we'll just have hot girls, uh, ladling out the chow.  No, no, no.  That will distract the contestants from the deliciousness of the soup.  Stacy.  Well, we'll see for the Naughty Nighty Contest.  Either way, we'll check you out, all right?  All right.  All right, cool.  Can't wait to see you tomorrow.  All right.  Because maybe she could grab my mule and ladle out clear stuff. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, mule!  I have a goat!  I have a goat!  J-more!  I miss you guys.  J-more!  Good God I miss my friends in New York.  What's up, guys?  How you doing, man?  Man, this clam chowder contest is the greatest thing I've ever heard of.  There's nothing better than projectile vomit, uh, and it being clam chowder.  Let me tell you something.  I'm down here in New Orleans, and the streets are littered with clam chowder.  I bet.  If you want to walk around in the street and projectile vomit, this is the town for you. 
[01:03:30]  This place is a play show.  Where do you think we're getting the chowder from?  Oh, my God.  And it's humid.  Five minutes off the airport, my taxi cab moss started growing on my back.  We're scraping up the chowder off the streets of, uh, New Orleans.  New Orleans.  New Orleans.  New Orleans.  How's it going down there, man?  It's going good, but the town's run by a bunch of carnies.  What do you mean?  You've been down here before?  Never.  We're going to be out to show more skin.  I mean, I was going to give a while, you know?  Oh, man.  It was Wednesday, yesterday. 
[01:04:00]  I got you.  And they wouldn't let me.  I see a picture, uh, right now.  I'm looking at it.  You are indeed holding your hands over your, your breasts.  You're very see-through, Naughty Ninety.  I'm very disappointed about that.  Who told you to cover up?  The girl who was taking my picture.  Whoever was, uh, running the photos for the station.  It wasn't I.  It wasn't Foz take her.  Why do we have a girl taking photos of other girls in Naughty Nineties?  Shouldn't happen.  That should never happen.  The girl's just doing everything.  Let's, let's get them on the phone. 
[01:04:30]  Find out what's happening here.  Okay.  No nudity.  Ooh.  No, none.  Well, you know what?  You're getting, Washington's going to kick your ass.  Hey.  You see what they're allowing in Washington?  Exactly.  Yes.  And they say we have no listeners down there?  Hello.  I've seen some of them.  Yeah.  The one that you guys were talking about, I've seen, yes.  You were the one I was talking about earlier when you put your hair in the pigtails with  the Catholic schoolgirl outfit.  Uh-huh.  Nice touch.  You went way up on the girl meter.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Way up.  I figured no one's done the schoolgirl thing yet. 
[01:05:00]  Hey, I'm going for it.  Turn around, Ant.  I think it's the last shot.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's one of the best shots in the whole contest.  Where she's, uh, kind of, her ass is perched.  You got the lollipop.  You got the skirt hiked up so we could see the white panties.  Pigtails.  Thank you.  Very firm buttocks.  Thank you.  If I can sound so sexy.  I've just got a very creamy butt buttocks.  Creamy and not chunky.  I'm like the clam chowder.  You don't have potato and clam butt, do you? 
[01:05:30]  Oh, no, no.  That's some sick stuff you guys are talking about.  Let me tell you.  If I could quote Dennis Leary, she's partially clad.  Partially clad.  Well, thank you, guys.  But, yeah, I just wanted to call you about the whole, uh, no nudity thing.  That's some conspiracy going on in Cleveland.  Yes, I agree.  We have a very good relationship going on in Cleveland and I'm disappointed by this today.  Oh, yeah.  Norton, come here.  Right here.  Ah, look.  Yeah.  Right here.  All right.  Well, Kristen, we're going to get them on the phone and we'll find out what's going on.  So keep listening, okay?  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Oh, little cheeks hitting the leg. 
[01:06:00]  Right where that part of the leg is the ass meat.  She's a slim goody.  Oh, she's hot.  She's a slim goody, as the brothers were saying.  That was Big Mike from the Bronx.  Yeah.  That was Big Mike from the Bronx.  A slim goody.  Jay, what are you doing down there, man?  I'm just sitting.  I'm listening to you.  Jay.  I'm laughing my ass off.  That girl must be hot if Norton thinks she's sexy and there's no urination involved.  Dude, she's really sexy, man.  She really hot.  Shut up.  He hasn't found one flaw in this contest yet.  I thought you'd know there's a couple of real pigs.  Norton, are you slacking off?  Usually you only get aroused if someone's urinating. 
[01:06:30]  I'm really turned on right now.  This one girl that was out there and had to go get her ID again, man, was just showing  me everything.  Oh.  Well, we'll have to see what that's all about.  Jay, let's just put it this way.  A Patriots linebacker joined the Naughty Nighty contest and Jim Norton thought it was hot.  Yeah.  Joe Abruzzi?  Joe Abruzzi whipped out his top four.  I said, if I give you beads, will you show me your breast?  He's like, okay.  We got it on film.  I give him some raggedy old beads and Joe Abruzzi just takes his B-cups out.  Classic.  Patriots are walking up and down the streets just vomiting in the streets.  It's nice to see they're focused. 
[01:07:00]  Take the over.  Guys from NASA are going to come down and calibrate how to work the freaking scoreboard  after the second quarter.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow, Jay.  That's funny.  I'm back.  I'm back.  That's from NASA.  That's very funny.  Look, we got a...  Well, where was your pimp hand?  We're talking to that fine Slim Goody from Cleveland and you had nothing.  Well, you know what, guys?  You had nothing.  It's been a while since I've been on the show.  I just wanted to give everybody the room.  I didn't want to butt in and be annoying.  You've got to get in here.  I can't wait to get back and see you guys. 
[01:07:30]  With some more debauchery.  Oh, I want to see people...  Oh, when I did that sketch with Alec Baldwin, we're all cops vomiting.  You guys remember that?  I don't remember.  No.  It's the one time I was on camera?  No, you were on when you had a wave goodnight.  Yeah, my recurring character was the guy that had a wave goodnight.  No, as I recall, you were in a fine little striped shirt on the Captain Nemo...  You had me and David Tell.  You and David Tell in a striped little shirt as one of the seamen.  Right.  I remember the skit where...  David Tell and I were seamen. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  I remember the skit where you had the longer hair and it had something to do with the zoo.  Kelsey Grammer, by the way, you know, you get the bio every Monday of whoever's hosting the show.  Right.  Okay.  Kelsey Grammer's brother got eaten by sharks.  Stop it.  Yeah, he did.  For real.  Yeah.  This is for real.  Kelsey Grammer...  Two of them.  And like someone else's family got bit by a shark.  Kelsey Grammer's family has more death than anyone else.  Tell me it was at the same time the brothers got eaten by sharks.  I don't know, but they're both like scuba, quote, accidents. 
[01:08:30]  So here's the thing.  In the bio, we read that.  And me and David Tell were like the only two guys that read his bio that week because it was towards the end of the season.  Right.  Everyone just fell out and they didn't care.  And Lauren says, Kelsey, is there anything you'd like to do this week?  And Kelsey says, I'd really like to do a James Bond sketch.  So Wednesday at the table we threw it Saturday Night Live.  I swear, there was like 15 James Bond sketches.  Yeah.  Seven of those, I swear to God, by coincidence.  And it was him getting eaten by a shark.  And he's like yelling stuff like, get away from me, you beast of the ocean. 
[01:09:00]  Stop eating me.  Oh, my God.  And then we settled on the sea monster that me and that sketch I was in.  It was like a big octopi.  And that's what we settled on instead of a shark because by the fifth sketch, he had tears in his eyes.  Oh, my God.  Stop eating me.  Damn you monster up the deep.  Hey.  Jay, you know we're syndicated to New Orleans, right?  Right.  All right.  Now they're all pissed because of you talking bad about their fine city. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, come on.  Tell everybody to relax.  Have a good time.  Let's get Mickey on the phone.  Mickey.  Hey.  You're on with Jay Moore.  What's up?  Jay, what's the deal, man?  You come here and, you know, you're all lovey-dovey on another station talking about you got a show coming up and it's going to be the greatest show on earth and you guarantee it.  Then you call it, oh, bang, and you're not rocking with us.  What's the deal?  Mickey, first of all, listen to your voice.  I don't even know what planet you're from with that.  Jay, what it says on the phone, it says, why don't you leave if you don't like it here? 
[01:10:00]  Because I have a job to do.  I'm working for Fox.  There you go.  And I'm doing a show.  And, Mickey, you don't have to come see my show.  And if you get offended for people just horsing around and having fun, then, you know, maybe you're a little too sensitive for a lot of comedy.  Geez, Louise, guys get all bent out of shape.  Take it easy, man.  Now we've got a cab driver.  People call Opie and Anthony and then when they say goodbye, they say, you guys suck.  Figure it out from there.  Jay?  Yes, sir.  Did you just say horsing around?  Yes, I did.  I had to call you out on that one. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, horseplay.  Oh, this is Ricky the cab driver.  Ricky.  Oh, man, how the hell are y'all?  What's that?  What's up?  You're on with Jay Moore.  What's up?  How cool is that, Jay?  I don't have to say a word.  Man, dude, every time I call y'all with some crazy stuff, man, y'all miss out on it because the dude didn't answer the phone, man.  I had some strippers right in front of the sugar shake fight.  The kid was fighting.  I tried to call y'all to get it.  Stripper fight?  I'd watch that, man. 
[01:11:00]  I'd watch that in a second.  I'd beat it to that.  Can someone out there translate Cajun for us?  What are you saying, Ricky?  Man, a bunch of black chick strippers fighting, man.  That's the most beautiful thing in the world.  And just flying everywhere.  Absolutely.  Hey, Ricky, why don't you take pictures of all this fun stuff you see?  Man, I will, man.  You need opposable digits to work a camera.  Oh, God damn. 
[01:11:30]  Holy Jesus.  Man, I can't drive here, man.  All right, Ricky.  You're breaking up, so I'm going to let you go, all right?  Ricky, I'm at the Intercontinental.  I need a ride.  I need you to take me to C Murder's house.  Jay, uh...  A C Murder's up for Murder.  The rapper C Murder?  Yeah.  I'd like to be his lawyer.  Ladies and gentlemen, the jury.  My client, Mr. Murder.  Didn't do it.  Let's hit play.  I'm going to shoot you in the face.  That's all, Your Honor.  I rest my case. 
[01:12:00]  Hold on.  Eddie is calling from Washington, D.C., and he has a message for Cleveland.  The cities are just about ready to go to war.  We've got border skirmishes.  Oh, I know.  This is what a thousandth indication happens.  A border skirmish.  Nice.  Well, we were picking on Boston real bad the first hour, but now all the energy is shifting  toward Cleveland now.  Eddie, what do you got?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Uh, I just want to tell Cleveland, Washington's got boobies.  Washington's got boobies.  Look at how they, uh, how mature they are.  For some reason, Cleveland wasn't allowed to show bare breasts. 
[01:12:30]  You know what, Anthony?  Yeah.  You may say, look how mature they are, but you know what?  All the great things in life have an elegant simplicity.  Exactly.  You don't have boobies.  When are you guys coming down here?  Uh, next Friday.  Next Friday.  You guys are going to have a good time.  Oh, good God.  Are you guys going to get drunk?  Yeah, we're psyched.  You guys are going to be vomiting hurricanes out of both ends.  I hear we got a good spot on Bourbon Street, so.  Are you guys going down to New Orleans?  Go to a huge-ass beers.  Yeah?  Huge-ass beers.  I like when they just tell you exactly what you're going to get. 
[01:13:00]  Huge-ass beers.  Well, tomorrow we're going to have huge-ass clam chowder.  Clam chowder.  Oh, God, you know what?  Hey, Jay.  I'm going to have Deacon Jones do that on stage tomorrow night.  Oh, Deacon Jones is going to sing on my show tomorrow night.  Well, he's a crooner, isn't he?  Deacon and the Deaconettes.  Yeah.  But they're all like 75 years old now, so I hope one of them doesn't break their hips  by doing some kind of rockettes.  Kyle Turley is going to be on the show tomorrow night.  I like Deacon Jones in the episode of The Odd Couple where he had to do the Razor commercial.  He was on the Brady Bunch.  Yeah.  Yeah, man. 
[01:13:30]  Deacon Jones.  Deacon Jones.  Gina from Union Beach is saying, I saw Jay on Fox's Best Damn Sports Show, period, the  last few nights.  Very funny stuff.  Ask him what Tom Brady's porn name is.  Edward Johnson.  Really?  Yeah.  I was at Media Day, and everyone was asking, like, how's the ankle?  How's the ankle?  How's the...  It's freaking hurt.  You don't have the guy's back.  What's your porn name?  You asked him that?  Yeah.  I asked Poe what his favorite teletoppy was.  He goes, uh, I like the red one, Poe. 
[01:14:00]  Just right off the bat.  I asked...  Who did I ask?  I asked Oz Akeem if you ever watched Oz Naked.  That was a big question.  Did you ever watch Oz Naked?  And they're all like, what?  Huh?  Brian Cox.  Yeah.  I had the sex division in the hotel, and Brian Cox said, oh, man, my hand threw me just  fine.  How about shaking his hand?  Sorry, Jay.  Oz music is playing right now.  Is that Oz?  Yeah, that was Oz music.  You know, everyone, uh, the TiVo people think I'm gay, because all my wife does is watch 
[01:14:30]  cranks on Queer as Folk and Oz.  They're like, here's some more recommendations for you, Mr. Moore.  More channels with guys with their cranks out.  Yeah, because TiVo knows what you're watching.  Did you guys see the Puerto Rican guy that was naked in the shower in the last episode  of Oz?  Hey, memo to that guy.  You might want to tug on it a little before you show the country you're junk.  It looks like a triangle.  Yeah.  It looks like a triangle.  Like Luke Perry, at least.  He came out, and he's like, you know, you know, he was kind of, you know, hanging around 
[01:15:00]  and pulling on it before the take.  You know, you got to do what you got to do.  No, the worst was that frigging guy from Biohazard.  Evan from Biohazard.  But the end of the episode, sitting in solitary, his junk, I swear to God, it was like he was  trying to jimmy the door with it.  Like he had a pipe.  You know, the show is great.  If it wasn't for so much...  You know, University of South Carolina again?  Hey, I got a t-shirt with that on. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  Hey, watch when you say Donna Reed is working the dumb button.  Hey, we got to get to the bottom of that Cleveland mess with the nudity guys, because Cleveland  is the coolest town in the world.  You can't have someone holding up the breakfasts.  Yeah, we'll work it out.  Hey, love you in C-Town, man.  I was there a year ago, and they're right when you guys got syndicated, they're right, you  guys.  Yeah.  We're going up to Cleveland soon.  I told you, you got to make a stop good.  When are you going up?  Do you know? 
[01:16:00]  Late March, early April.  Yeah, just say...  No, we don't have a definite date yet, but we're figuring it out.  I guarantee you guys are going to have the greatest time in the world in Cleveland.  You got to go to the flats.  Jay, what do you think about the game?  I think the Rams are going to win by about 37.  I think the Rams at halftime will stick their heads out of the locker room to watch  you two.  Jay, what...  You think?  I really do.  What do the Pats have to do to win this game? 
[01:16:30]  I think...  You know when they release, like, an eagle to show, like, unity?  Because they can't have planes go by because it's a poem, and that might be a disaster.  Right.  So they might release, like, a bald eagle, something beautiful like that.  I think it would have to claw out Kurt Warner's eye.  Not even eyes.  Just one will do the job.  Just one eye.  Just for the sheer...  Because the Rams stunned that their quarterback's eye got pecked out by an American bald eagle.  That'll throw them off a yard or two. 
[01:17:00]  Hey, Norton, what are you doing?  Hello.  Hi, Jay.  Oh, hi, buddy.  All right.  I'm just listening.  All right, guys.  I'm just glad to check in, and it's been way too long.  It's great.  It's just great talking to you.  I'm laughing harder now than I laughed in three weeks.  Where's your gig?  You doing a gig in New Orleans?  I'm doing the Sanger Theater.  And here's a memo to anybody that's going on my show tomorrow night at the Sanger Theater.  It's a little bit in the hood, but that's where all the shows are.  And when you come out of the theater, make sure you make a left.  Because if you make a right, bad things will happen. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, wow.  It's that serious, huh?  Well, I'm just telling you, New Orleans has all...  You know, every city has, like, a ghetto, but New Orleans, it's a different level.  It's like the ghetto, and then there's, like, the inner sanctum of ghetto.  If they're cutting off chicken heads and dancing in the streets, is that a bad thing?  On my way to a radio station today, I thought I just drove past the John Cougar Mellon Camp video.  Paper and file.  Hey, we got Foz checking in from Cleveland. 
[01:18:00]  He'll get to the bottom of this nudity thing.  Let me...  Come on.  Foz?  Yeah, he's a cool guy, actually.  Foz.  Oh, you just hung up on him.  Oh, Foz, yes.  Guys, what's going on, man?  I take one day off, and you guys are bashing Cleveland?  No, no, we're bashing the photo that was taken yesterday.  The one girl wanted to get pretty naked, and I guess whoever took your place said,  no, you've got to cover up.  We got a professional photographer here that's taking the pictures, 
[01:18:30]  and we're going by the rules that were given to us, man, with no pornographic pictures.  By who?  I don't know, whatever rules were sent to us.  Pornographic, they're pressed.  Pressed are not...  They're not pornographic.  Topless is okay, and at this point, I would rip up the rule book.  I'm done.  We're doing what we can.  You know what?  Washington is making fun of you today, Foz.  Washington, Washington.  Washington's got, what, one or two girls, man?  We gave you 13, 14 girls.  You're right, Foz, but Washington has Stephanie, number 37. 
[01:19:00]  Take a gander, and you will see what the rule book is all about.  Let me look at Stephanie here.  You pop Stephanie up, and you tell us.  And you drop up.  Hey, Foz, how much pot do you smoke before you get to the station?  I rather would not say.  Okay.  You've got that little pot voice.  But, dude, I mean, we gave you guys like 13 girls, man.  You can't...  Mucho appreciato.  Now get their clothes off.  Let me tell you something.  The girl we just talked to from Cleveland, what's her name again, Ant? 
[01:19:30]  Anna.  Anna, thanks, Jay.  The one that wanted to get naked?  Yeah.  She got some hot pictures in this contest.  If she was a little more nude, she'd be a finalist, my friend.  Yep.  All right, Mel, I'll see what I can do.  Foz, you're being very vague about where these rules came down from.  Foz, you're being very unfoz.  You want Anna to come by the station again to get a reshoot?  Opie, this hasn't been resolved. 
[01:20:00]  What are you talking about?  If Anna wants to come back by the station and get a reshoot, man, we will definitely get her some better pictures.  See?  No, this isn't resolved.  Oh, boy.  Cleveland.  Foz.  Oh, boy.  Who said no breasts in the pictures?  That's the rules that came down from...  From who?  Who told you?  John Rossi.  John Rossi?  Whatever promotions coordinator guy that sent the rules to...  John Rossi hands out t-shirts in front of bars, dude.  John Rossi's lucky he's in freaking baseball, for Christ's sake. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, we got to play it.  Oh, go get it.  We got to play it.  Get to your old Weaver.  Terry Crowley.  He got released by the goddamn Cincinnati Reds.  He got released by...  We figured we could pay him to sit around like any other effing fan.  And hopefully break but open in the effing ninth.  Foz, I...  You and Earth, the manager show, coming up on your baseball effing network.  Wow, you got it.  Foz, I don't understand.  It's whatever rules were said to us by the promotions people. 
[01:21:00]  Being very on cause.  We're changing the rules right now.  These are the better, more gooder, more higher up rules.  These are the Opie and Anthony rules.  More gooder.  You get on me for pushing around, man.  More gooder.  We use more gooder always.  And we made more gooder very cool.  More gooder is more gooder of a word.  Than horsing around.  We haven't made horsing around cool yet.  I'm going to start using more gooder.  More gooder.  Jay also said G's Louise.  I say G malently. 
[01:21:30]  I do say G's Louise a lot.  Ah, G's Louise.  You will get a lot of chuckles if you use more gooder.  Chuckles.  They will chuckle at you.  How about some chuckles?  How about chuckles the candy with the clam chowder?  Ah, that was...  The big sugar thing of chuckles.  Foz?  I like those.  Yeah.  Are you going to let Washington kick your ass in this contest?  No, I'm not going to let Washington kick our ass, dude.  All right.  Foz, what are you doing?  A girl comes in.  She says, let me take my top off and take pictures.  What happens then?  Go.  I'm not the one taking the pictures, man.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy. 
[01:22:00]  Dude, dude, dude.  We got a problem.  Dude, who's quoting scripture and taking these pictures?  We want hoods.  Yeah, who's taking the pictures?  Oh, man.  We're not talking about peaches.  We're talking about lovely breasts.  Foz, put the photographer on the phone.  Uh, actually, the photographer isn't even here today.  We have someone else taking the pictures today.  All right.  Uh, now, if a girl comes in and wants to get topless, what will that photographer do?  Uh, we will probably have her get topless then.  All right.  Probably.  Probably. 
[01:22:30]  Foz?  Probably, Foz?  Foz.  All right.  We will have her get topless if she wants to get topless.  There we go.  I like the way you sound.  We were going to delay our visit to Cleveland a month.  How's that, man?  Hey, one thing you know about Cleveland, they know how to rally.  Just ask Art Modell, baby.  If you don't get Cleveland on your bad side, Foz.  I'm not looking at getting anybody on my bad side.  Oh, no.  Let's see town rally.  Let's see the blouse puppies.  Get it together.  Of course, Cleveland has given us huge ratings, Jay, and we do have to get out there eventually. 
[01:23:00]  But I did look at the ratings from Vegas, and we did go up 0.1.  So we have to get to Vegas.  It's like tomorrow.  We had a little bump up.  Yeah, a little bump.  Who doesn't want to go to Vegas?  We call it a bump in the business.  A little bump.  A little bump.  A little spike.  Yeah, sure.  All right, Foz.  All right, guys.  We're counting on you.  Don't let Washington push you around.  I will not let Washington beat our ass.  All right.  Hey, Foz.  Yeah. 
[01:23:30]  Spell Chrysanthemum.  This is now, I want the girls in Cleveland to let us know what happened.  You know something, girls?  Test this.  I want a real.  I want a test today.  I want a real slutty broad.  Right.  Go down there.  Go down to the station right now to test out Foz and what he just told us.  Yeah.  Show your hairy pork chop.  The sluttier the better.  Yeah.  Say, I want to take it all off, and I just want to wear a dental floss.  Test Foz's loyalty to the show. 
[01:24:00]  Ah, pool ball.  Team speed, for Christ Almighty.  All right.  We've got to let everyone go.  All right, man.  Hey, Jay.  Foz, take it easy.  Jay, when you're in New York, man.  Jay, if you want to continue with us, that's cool.  We've just got to take this break.  You know what I'm saying.  I've got to run to media.  I've got to go to FanFest right now for Fox.  Hey, call us when we're in Boston tomorrow.  You guys are going to be in Boston tomorrow?  Yeah.  We've got the chowder bowl.  You're doing that in Boston?  Yeah.  We're sending a lucky winner.  I know what I'm doing in the studio.  You're smart.  You take all the poop outside.  That's for sure. 
[01:24:30]  You guys are smart.  Well, it's going to be some bad weather, so we're bringing it indoors.  I'm smart.  You're not dumb, like people think.  Dude, you're being very unduned.  God bless you guys.  Jay Moore.  Peace.  All right.  Dude.  That's funny.  I wasn't feeling something with Foz.  I think he's, and it's not his fault.  I understand.  He's a company guy.  He's a soldier in a long line, a cog in the machine.  He's definitely getting some pressure. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  But from who?  That's what I want to know.  We make the rules to this contest.  Don't make us call it a contest with a U, because we'll do that.  Wow.  Then there'll be some trouble.  And?  Yes.  The Earl Weaver thing that Jay Moore was referring to.  Very funny.  This is classic.  Remember Earl Weaver, the old manager for the Orioles there?  He went off one day.  Check it out.  Up now, the manager's corner, with the thoughts and opinions of the American League's winning 
[01:25:30]  as manager, the Orioles, Earl Weaver.  And now, to the manager's corner with Earl Weaver.  Well, Bill Whitehouse, Earl, that certainly is an answer, from Frederick Merriman, wants to  know why you and the Orioles don't go out and get some more team speak.  Team speed, for Christ's sake.  You get some goddamn little fleas on a f***ing basis, getting picked off, trying to steal,  getting thrown out, taking runs away from you.  You get them big f***suckers that can hit the f***ing ball out of the ballpark, and you 
[01:26:00]  can't make any goddamn mistake.  Well, certainly, this show is going to get out in history, Earl.  Terry Elliott of Washington, D.C. wants to know why you don't use Terry Crowley as a  designated hitter all the time.  Well, Terry Crowley's lucky he's in f***ing baseball, for Christ's sake.  He was released by the Cincinnati Reds.  He was released by the f***ing goddamn Atlanta Braves.  We saw that Terry Crowley could sit on his f***ing ass for eight innings and enjoy watching  a baseball game, just like any other fan, and has the ability to get up there and break 
[01:26:30]  one open in a f***ing night.  So, if this f***er could mind his own business, and let me manage the f***ing team, we'd be  a lot better off.  Well, certainly, you've made your opinions known on the fans' questions about baseball,  Earl, but let's get to something else.  Alice Sweet from Norfolk wants to know the best time to put in a tomato plant.  Alice Sweet ought to be worried about where the f*** her next lane's coming from, rather  than where her next goddamn tomato plant's coming from.  If she'd get her ass out to f***ing bars at night and go hustling around the goddamn street,  she might get a f*** stuck in her once in a while. 
[01:27:00]  I don't understand where these questions are coming from, Tom.  That's about it from Manager's Corner.  Go f*** yourself, and the f*** with your show coming up next on the Baltimore Oriole  Baseball f***ing Network.  Good evening, ignorant pigs.  Put down your crackpipes and your beer bombs, and pay attention.  I'm a virgin.  Hey!  The Opie and Anthony Show.  A four-hour parade of meat.  A-M-D-W. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, works better when the microphones are on, I know.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi.  We went a little long with a couple segments, so we had to catch up.  Don't worry.  We still have shorter commercial breaks.  Which are?  More gooder.  More gooder.  More gooder.  Dave from Cleveland has a response for Washington, D.C., Anthony.  Yeah.  The city's getting a little rambunctious today.  A little rambunctious, aren't they? 
[01:28:00]  They're getting a little out of control.  Now, what did Washington say to Cleveland again?  Ha-ha, we have boobs.  We have boobs.  Ha-ha, we have boobs, I believe was the exact quote from Washington, D.C.  So now let's go to Dave from Cleveland.  Dave, what's up?  What's going on?  Hey.  Norton, you rule.  Thank you, Dave.  No problem.  Well, Washington may have the boobies, but Cleveland, we have the ratings.  Oh, that's true.  Well, take that.  You guys suck.  I got that right.  There's a girl outside with double G boobs. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  Double G.  Oh.  And she's going to enter the Naughty Nighty contest here in New York.  Wow.  New York coming out strong, I must say.  We were down on New York, but we have like four or five contestants.  We have two girls making out on the Ikea furniture out there.  The beer's flown.  We got some kind of Terminator pinball machine.  Terminator 2 pinball machine.  From ClassicPinball.com.  And they want to come in and say a few words on the air, so stick around for that.  That should be very exciting.  Yeah, yeah.  Who needs the girls?  I want to hear the pinball guys, you know.  How heavy was that devil? 
[01:29:00]  I want to hear how the machine tilts.  What's Arnold say then?  I hope they have a sense of humor.  Are you kidding?  They're kidding.  Will you at some point wow us?  Maybe.  Maybe.  I just thought I'd bring the Classic Pinball guys in so they could see.  Would you show the Classic Pinball guys what that looks like outside of the...  Show the guys from ClassicPinball.com.  Would you?  She's nervous.  Okay, very quick. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, okay.  Get the guys in here.  Oh, if she's going very quick, she's got to go very quick this way.  Well, you know.  Screw the guys from ClassicPinball.com.  She's very sexy.  You are very sexy.  Where are you from?  Um, Queens.  Queens?  Hey, here they are.  Hey.  ClassicPinball.com guy.  How are you, sir?  Yeah, no, you go over there.  You go over there.  Ah, these are real strong looking men.  Hold the fella down if you wanted.  I thought because you did us such a big favor bringing in the Terminator 2 pinball machine  that I would do you a favor and let you see those beautiful double G breasts. 
[01:30:00]  I appreciate that I keep bumping into them.  They're hard to miss.  Hey, how old are you?  23.  23.  23.  I was thinking we might have like an upper teen on our hands.  With double G's.  Well, when did you start developing those?  Two?  Actually, very late.  I was a late bloomer.  Late bloomer.  That sounds great.  So, there's hope for my 30-year-old girlfriend?  Oh, man.  Just know every time you make a girlfriend joke, you're making a Rick's sister joke, Opie. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, I forgot, Rick.  I thought you were taking pictures.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Well, it's because your boobs are bigger than hers.  Oh, Jesus Christ, man.  I tripped over an air tank outside.  That's brutal.  That hurt.  Nice.  Stick to the pinball, sir.  He was trying to kind of move into the realm of comedy there for a second.  He was trying to...  That's okay.  That wasn't that bad a line.  You know what that was?  I'll give a little thing, something you can understand. 
[01:31:00]  That joke was like the ball when it goes right between the flippers.  Right.  Game over.  Yeah, it's going to take a couple more quarters.  That was more a tilt.  Was that...  No, that was down...  Because you can't even play anymore and you get pissed off.  Oh, and the ball's just bouncing, just doing nothing until it goes...  It goes down the middle, you know.  All right, I made a bad shot.  Tilt.  It's like, I can't even, like, save this.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Just got to watch it go down the toilet.  Well, come on, guys.  I want to see those mule huggers.  Hey, what do you say?  You show the guys... 
[01:31:30]  Okay, okay.  Wait, hold on.  Let the Richard Moll stand over here.  I know Richard Moll.  The guy's seven foot tall.  Are you crazy?  All right, guys.  Let's have a seat.  All right, let's see.  This is going to be quick.  Well, not too quick.  Too quick is really bad.  Because then we forcibly have to see him, and it gets ugly.  Okay.  Let's see.  Wow!  Oh, my goodness!  Dude, you make sure you show a lot of that in your pictures,  and I do believe we have another finalist in the studio for the 90-90 contest. 
[01:32:00]  I love large, the areola.  Yes, did you see that?  Wow!  Really hot.  Very nice.  Last time I saw anything like that, I was pouring some syrup over them, right?  Yes.  Just big.  They were about that size and color and everything.  Very nice.  I had two of those for breakfast this morning.  Yes.  I like that.  Over easy.  Little Aunt Jemima on top, and...  Very nice.  That's nice.  Well, good luck with the pictures. 
[01:32:30]  Okay, thank you.  All right, there she goes.  Thank you very much.  And, Rick, have you taken the pictures yet?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, very good.  She'll be up very short.  Her boobs have left the studio, and...  There was some cops out there that didn't get to see that.  Now she has.  That wasn't right.  Well, let outside, let our special guests...  Yeah, they're called special guests, Jim.  Very special guests.  Oh, okay.  All right.  That way we keep it quiet, because they should be clubbing protesters in the head right now.  But they're bored, S-less, and they're trying to stop by. 
[01:33:00]  Jamie, what's going on?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Calling from Sacramento.  Hey.  Lots of calls from Sacramento today.  I like that.  Feeling it.  Well, the only time we can call is during another radio program, but we love listening to you.  Oh, that's right.  I want to give my props to Teen Rihanna.  All right.  Let me...  I got to get the reference.  I know who Teen Rihanna is.  She's the...  Hello, Leopard.  I have Leopard Bikini.  The Leopard Bikini.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to say something.  I think she's my favorite teen in the contest.  Your favorite teen?  How many teens do we have in the contest now? 
[01:33:30]  Like six or seven.  Six or 17.  You know what she is?  She's buxom.  She's buxom.  Wouldn't you say that?  A buxom gal.  She's a buxom gal.  Not to piss on a Sacramento Natalie, but Rihanna's got her beat any day of the week.  Hey, you know, Jamie, I've got to let you go, because Chachi's on the phone.  Take care, guys.  Hey, Chachi.  Where's Chachi?  Before I talk to Chachi, I just want to read a couple more instant feedbacks. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  Mike from Jersey writes, holy crap, I just saw Boston's entry in the Naughty Nighty Contest.  Not Boston's entries, but Boston's entry in the Naughty Nighty Contest.  I didn't know Babe Ruth was back in Boston.  Tommy from Satin Island.  Hey, Boston, we all love the green monster, but what's with the white one?  Best joke about her right there.  Very funny.  Hey, and Chachi's on the phone.  Chachi.  Chachi.  We're struggling in Boston. 
[01:34:30]  Chachi.  Might I say, liar, liar, pants on fire.  Now, let me tell you my train of thought as this was happening yesterday.  Speaking of trains.  I'll tell you one thing, man.  Nice locomotive.  You're a good liar.  I'm never going to believe you.  These two women come to the office, and one has some major cleavage.  Now, they're covered up pretty good, but the cleavage looks very nice.  So I bring them into the conference room, a very dull room, and these two girls are with the cleavage.  And, of course, I'm kissing their butts.  I didn't know the butts were that big. 
[01:35:00]  And, yeah, everything looked good until the clothes came off.  And by that time, I was off the air.  Chachi, that's what's representing your fine suit.  Yeah, there it is.  I was told you picked the worst picture.  No, no.  Send another hundred if you need to.  There is no worst picture.  Do you have some taken by the Hubble?  Okay, well, what should I do?  Should I, um, how about if we get someone really hot today to come here?  I'll give them a pair of creed tickets.  I know what you should do.  How about back out of the contest? 
[01:35:30]  We're not backing out of the contest.  We're working at a disadvantage, but we'll come through like the Patriots did.  Who knew that they'd go to the Super Bowl?  Well, she's playing for them.  Now, Chachi, more important.  Yes.  More important, Link.  Yes.  Are we ready with the, well, let's describe the chowder.  Are we ready for the, um, the chowder event?  We are ready.  We have 40 gallons to start.  Is it, is it nice, thick, creamy, chunky chowder? 
[01:36:00]  Very creamy, extra milk, nice big chunks of clam.  Ah, it's been boiled down, simmering.  It has been boiled at one of the finest seafood restaurants for hours.  You know, you have to reduce chowder there, Opie.  You know that?  You simmer it on the stovetop until it reduces down.  That's what gives it that thick, creamy consistency.  That they're going to love shoveling in their mouth so much tomorrow.  Bowl after bowl after tasty, delicious, thick, creamy, chunky bowl.  And perhaps before they get here, they'll be having a big, hearty lunch. 
[01:36:30]  And then they come to the station for chowder.  Right up to the tippy top, brimming with delicious goodness.  We're going to have big buckets next to every contestant.  Yeah, very good.  And we're going to have bowls, and we'll fill them every ten minutes, as you say, with the finest clam chowder in Boston.  Yeah.  When we see the 40 gallons disappear, if it does get to that point, we'll send out for more.  We'll continue to replenish the stock.  Stick to your rib-heartiness.  Until nine people have regurgitated in Tony Berardini's air studio. 
[01:37:00]  Yes.  I can't wait.  We're looking forward to the broadcast live tomorrow.  And, of course, all the girls could show up for the Naughty Nighty contest.  Puking and hotness, all in the same day.  Last night, I puked after I saw her.  All right.  Hey, Chachi, does everyone know how they could win this trip to the Super Bowl?  We want everybody to come down tomorrow, starting at 2 o'clock, you had said.  We're going to give everybody numbers.  The numbers will go in a barrel.  We'll have random drawings to get ten contestants. 
[01:37:30]  This is what I scored.  We have, like, 50-plus WBCN New England Patriots fleece jackets we're going to give to you to give away.  Nice.  The people who come down, we have WOW T-shirts.  We've got lots of other stuff.  And, of course, the vomiting.  We have a dumpster in the back yard to throw out all the bags.  Oh, that's good.  And it's going to be an exciting afternoon and evening.  40 gallons.  I'm looking forward to it.  Then we'll all go out for dinner afterwards.  Hey, Chachi, hold on.  This guy wants to comment about your contestant.  Oh, come on.  Joe, what's up?  Yo, what's up, Owen A? 
[01:38:00]  Hey.  What's going on?  I just wanted to know if that was Norm from Cheers, the guy from Boston.  Yeah, everybody knows her frame.  Also, Norton, I just want to say, no one plugs Norton's website, but it's hilarious.  Thank you.  Eatabullet.com, all right?  What's that, sir?  You guys suck.  All right.  Bye, Joe.  Dude, come on, man.  Thank you, but this is not the time for Eatabullet.com plugs.  I talked over him.  No, we got to talk about ClassicPinball.com.  ClassicPinball.com. 
[01:38:30]  Guys, I got to say thank you so much.  You know something?  After Opie smashed that Rolling Stones pinball machine, I thought that was it.  We weren't going to see another pinball machine in here.  You guys came through.  One of my favorites of all time.  I remember back in the early 90s playing T2 pinball.  91?  Yeah.  And you guys brought it here, and I'm loving it.  Boy, I'm right back at it.  Game rules.  Thank you, ClassicPinball.com.  Well, it's our pleasure.  It's the least we could do since you smashed the other one. 
[01:39:00]  I did not smash that.  You know, it only lasted 24 hours.  You know, we are separate entities.  I know that it wasn't you.  That was my old personality.  I've turned over a new leaf.  He's changed.  Yeah.  Been a lot nicer.  Well, I will...  I think it makes the place look great.  It does.  And I will make sure that nothing happens to that.  I need Gallagher.  I need Gallagher slash Ms. Pac-Man.  And our green room will be complete.  That's a good one.  You know what makes me feel really good?  They gave me the key to the game.  I have the key to the door. 
[01:39:30]  That's like a dream come true.  Make people pay.  The key.  That'll be for...  Can I open it up and make it so you have to pay?  We can arrange that if you'd like.  Yeah.  We can set it so high that you're the only one that'll play it.  Nobody else will want to play it.  No.  I think I'll open the machine up to everybody.  All right.  I'm a hell of a guy.  Hey, Chachi?  Yeah.  I'm still here.  I know you are.  Dude, what are you doing to me?  What's the matter?  I was just waiting to see you awkwardly hang up in the background.  She had a great set yesterday, but then they disappeared when she took her top off. 
[01:40:00]  They just fell.  She might have one of those Wonder Bras or something.  Yeah, no wonder.  And no more contestants today, huh?  I tell you, if we get a good-looking girl before 7 o'clock tonight, I swear, I have a pair of tickets to see Creed sold out at the Fleet Center.  But they have to join the Naughty Nighty contest.  What?  All right.  What?  Thank you, Chachi.  Gentlemen, we'll see you tomorrow.  Okay.  We look forward to it.  She's actually sexy in a dump, sweet kind of way. 
[01:40:30]  Hey, Anthony Jason's checking in from WJFK in Washington, D.C.  Hey, Anthony, you should charge for that game.  You can have the girl from Boston stand next to the machine, and when guys need change, she can sit on dollar bills and squeeze out quarters.  And, boy, she's taking a lot of abuse, man.  From all over the country.  We're, once again, coming through big.  Oh, you got another contestant? 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, 5'10", blonde.  Wow.  And can we play a guess what she does for a living?  A dancer?  No.  I'm praying she's a hooker.  No.  Let's see.  Veterinarian?  No.  Hey, the girl with the double G's, her pictures are up on opiananthony.com.  Oh, are they?  I'll have to take a quick look.  What could a 5'10"?  She's a basketball player.  No, you're close, Norton.  Volleyball.  No, close. 
[01:41:30]  You're in the right field.  She sells glasses of tinkle.  Field hockey.  No, well, you're getting closer.  How about it?  Soccer.  No.  She scoops out Christopher Reeve's duty bag.  No.  She's a pro wrestler.  Look at that and laughing at himself.  He couldn't even get the line out.  Wait, she's a pro wrestler?  Yeah, she's a pro wrestler.  For who?  Sasha.  Who do you wrestle for, Sasha?  Here she comes. 
[01:42:00]  Hi, Opie and Anthony.  Hi, Sasha.  Hi, how are you guys?  Who do you wrestle for?  Um, I wrestle for a whole bunch of places in the mid-Atlantic coast.  Um, do MDW, CPW, MCW, a bunch of places.  How about WWF?  Um, someday, hopefully, yes, but currently, no.  All right.  So, are you a muscular gal?  Feminently muscular.  Uh, like, who, who would you, uh, equate your body to as far as WWF goes? 
[01:42:30]  Oh, she's no China, guys.  All right, you're not like China.  No, at all.  Uh, like who?  What's body type from WWF?  Um, I would say she's more like Lita.  Wow.  Like Lita?  Wow, nice.  All right.  That's good.  All right.  Lita's kind of like a butter face, though.  No, she's not a butter face, though.  All right, yeah, cool.  Very hot.  She looks Swedish.  You'll have the pictures tonight.  Oh, Swedish.  Good, yeah.  Oh, good.  Sure.  Okay.  All right, man, we're going to continue to come up strong in D.C. 
[01:43:00]  I'll tell you, the country's, uh, raving as far as the contestants in, uh, D.C. go.  Very nice.  And I think Stephanie's coming in for a reshoot, but I haven't heard from her, but, uh, we'll  try to do better than we did last time.  Which one's Stephanie?  The one that's showing?  The one that you guys were going crazy about yesterday.  She doesn't like her pictures?  Uh, no, she just mentioned that she was coming in for a reshoot.  I don't know what that means.  Good girl.  Thank you, Jason.  Very good.  Bye.  Washington coming on.  Strill in Boston was going to come in for a reshoot, but a hunter shot her on the way.  Oh, my God. 
[01:43:30]  Dude.  Wow.  Mm, Swedish girl.  Nice big blonde.  Yeah.  Two of those, two of those things hanging down like gummy bears.  Dropping little meatballs on your chest.  Straighten you right out.  Mm.  Mm.  Yeah.  Ooh, it tastes like fiber. 
[01:44:00]  Yes.  Katie.  Yes.  Hi.  Katie.  How are you?  Have you been listening to us on hold?  I sure have.  Are you scared?  Um, not at all.  Oh, good.  Good.  You're from a magazine I don't read.  Um, Jane magazine.  Which one?  Jane.  I've read a little bit out of Jane when I've seen something, uh, on the cover.  I bet you have.  It might have been a little interesting.  It's hard to compete with a pair of double G boobs, but I'll do my best.  Yeah.  Do you have, uh, double G boobs?  Not at all.  Okay. 
[01:44:30]  No.  Now, she's got an interesting story, though.  This, um, this girl applied to be an intern for former President Bill Clinton.  Katie?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You, Katie?  I sure did.  Yes.  So, you got big boobs.  I'm a healthy girl.  I've read the story.  She's a healthy girl.  And we'll explain.  I, I thought you were like, uh, I don't know, the, the, someone that worked for the magazine.  You know, you could probably tell the story better than I, because it was you.  And I, I found this very funny. 
[01:45:00]  So, just let the people know, uh, what you did and, uh, what happened.  Okay.  Well, we, we heard that the former President Clinton's office was looking for interns.  And so, a bunch of us didn't, resumes, and nobody heard anything back.  And then, we dropped off, um, my resume again with a Polaroid of me in a red dress.  And three, wait, three hours later, they called me in for an interview.  Isn't that classic?  All the qualifications that are on, uh, all these different resumes, they didn't pay any attention to it. 
[01:45:30]  They didn't, uh, call anyone back.  But, the second you sent in a picture in a red dress showing that you're a healthy girl.  Can I, can I help this story a little, uh, a little bit, Anthony?  Because they have a whole list of the, the wannabe interns.  Yeah.  So, there was intern wannabe number one.  She attended SUNY Stony Brook.  Uh, the response?  Nothing.  Okay.  Intern wannabe number two.  An NYU student.  Zilch.  Uh, pushy follow-up calls resulted in a Clinton staffer saying that all positions were filled. 
[01:46:00]  Even doggy style.  Intern wannabe number three, which was Katie.  Yeah.  Uh, the response?  Not a word.  Yeah.  Intern wannabe number four.  Katie again.  Same exact resume.  Same exact resume with a photo of herself looking pretty hot.  Right, Katie?  Right.  Cleavage and everything?  That's not good enough.  Well, just showing that she's a healthy girl.  Just showing.  Healthy girl.  Just showing the assets.  The response?  Three hours later, Clinton's office called her for an interview. 
[01:46:30]  How soon can you come in?  They asked.  The guy who interviewed her the next day said her cover letter really stood out and chuckled.  Are you going to take the gig?  Me?  Yeah.  I would have.  You really would have?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I think that, uh, Bill Clinton, we love him.  He's a solid guy.  We just had some fun with us.  And he had brilliant foreign policy.  Um, but would you have, what would you have done if he had, like, hit on you? 
[01:47:00]  Oh.  Oh, I couldn't say.  I'm, I'm actually more of an Al Gore fan myself.  Al Gore.  Al Gore.  He's not a tough on crime guy.  But no, what would you have done if Clinton had hit on you?  Al Gore.  Would you have, you know, he's a good looking guy.  I mean, he's not just the president.  He was very handsome.  Oh, you find him handsome there, uh?  Yeah.  Do you?  No, I'm just saying.  Would you have gone with it if he had, you know?  Asked to see the goat?  Yeah.  I beg your pardon.  If he had hit on you, would you have went with it?  Or would you have said no thank you?  Yeah.  Like, even before any of this happened?  I think, I think I would have politely demurred. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Do we even know why you, uh, are not an intern?  Um, it's a great question.  I, I, I wish I'd gotten the job.  You really do.  It looks like they wanted you, right?  So, what happened?  I don't know.  I, I, I don't know what happened.  Hmm.  I'm just a great candidate, so.  Couldn't say.  Even with what happened, you would have been an intern.  You do know that eventually you probably would have gotten hit on.  Oh, if only.  You probably would have. 
[01:48:00]  He doesn't hang out with his wife anymore.  That whole thing, uh, have you been keeping tabs on what, uh, Bill's been up to?  Um, no, not exactly.  The guy, first of all, you never, ever, ever, ever see him and Hillary together anymore.  There's no reason for it.  She got elected.  He's not president anymore.  They don't have to carry on that charade for another day.  So, uh, he's out.  Now, the last picture we have seen of, uh, Bill Clinton is in, um, Israel. 
[01:48:30]  Oh.  He was in Jerusalem, and he's, it's, and.  Nice work if you can get it.  Well, yeah.  But, um, I don't know, he's kind of, he's kind of showing his true colors here, like  anyone didn't know what they were, but perhaps the guy should have paid a little more attention  on foreign policy and what the hell was going on in the world than trying to get laid.  You know what I mean?  Hey, Toots, are you going to apply for, uh, the Bush White House at all?  Am I Toots?  Yeah, are you going to apply for the Bush White House?  Um, I don't do Republicans. 
[01:49:00]  Why not?  No?  What do you think of George W?  Um.  Who cares?  Yeah, I, I, I don't.  Are, are you, are you going to protest for the World Economic, uh, Summit?  Only in fur.  You don't like fur, do you?  I just think she said she was going to wear fur.  Oh, okay.  Uh, I just see her as one of those, um, liberal women.  Yeah, but she's young.  What are you, 22, 23?  What are you going to do?  I'm 25.  Yeah, all right, that's, you know, that's still relatively young. 
[01:49:30]  I mean, hey, who turned off the power?  Would you, like, if you had, say, to become an intern for Clinton, I'm asking this in all seriousness,  would you have been angry if he arched seeds on you?  Thank your pardon, would I have been angry if he what?  Arched seeds on you.  Like he did with, uh, what's that?  Monica, he arched some seeds on your dress.  Arched seed.  You got it?  Arched seed?  You don't get out much, do you?  No.  Katie, what do you do for fun? 
[01:50:00]  I talked to you guys.  Wow.  What are you talking about?  Well, that's what we've been asking.  No, we're saying hobbies.  Yeah, like, what do you do for fun?  Um, I'm, I'm, I'm a good girl.  Uh-huh.  All right.  No, I, I'm, I'm.  Is that, is that you banging your head against a wall?  Ah, yeah.  All right.  All right.  Um, all right, she can't, she can't hear us.  What do you want? 
[01:50:30]  So, why don't we do a little, uh, silent game?  All right.  Huh?  What's that, uh?  Katie.  Katie.  Yeah?  You're a reporter for who?  I'm a reporter for Jane Magazine.  And, uh, what kind of stories do you do for Jane Magazine?  I do, I do undercover work.  What do you mean by that?  Um, I go to sex addicts conferences, I, I hang out with polygamists, I, I apply for  internships at the former President Clinton's office, you name it.  Anything, anything you want to see is in, is in the April issue of Jane, it's on the 
[01:51:00]  newsstand February 11th.  Hello?  Hello?  One more, one more hello?  Come on.  One more hello?  Hello?  Come on.  Where'd she go? 
[01:51:30]  Oh.  You're breathing.  She's holding in.  She's holding on a little.  She's hanging in there.  Hanging in.  Getting a little frustrated.  A little sorry.  Mm-hmm.  One more hello.  Hello?  Say hello if you are a her bag.  Hello?  One more hello.  Ooh, getting a little.  If you are a her bag. 
[01:52:00]  She's getting mad.  You can tell.  Fat, heaving body.  One more hello if you are a twat.  Mm-hmm.  Does she know this show?  This is the best defense for the silent game.  The reverse silent game.  Right in.  Wait, four.  What?  Someone talking to her.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello? 
[01:52:30]  What's she doing?  She's calling back.  She's calling back.  But see, it's busy because she's still on the other line.  Hello?  Hold back.  Hold back.  She's calling.  She's calling the line we gave her, but she's still on.  And she doesn't know.  And she goes, listen. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, it's still busy.  She's calling herself.  What are those people doing?  Why is it still busy?  I'll try again.  I bet it's busy.  One more time.  Come on.  Try again.  Oh, yeah.  I bet your ten bucks is busy.  Okay.  Ah-ha.  Pay me.  Oh.  Oh.  I got a little pissed.  Hello?  Andrea?  Hello?  Andrea?  Hello?  Andrea?  Am I done?  Am I done?  It's sort of cut off, and then... 
[01:53:30]  More than you know.  I'm asking if I'm done, because it cut off, and...  Can I hang up the phone now?  Well, they said, what do you do?  And I told them, and then there was silence, and it looks like the line's still engaged, but...  Call back again.  Call again. 
[01:54:00]  Come on, you dope.  Come on, come on.  She called back.  Listen, I bet it's busy, Opie.  It's busy, because she's calling the number that we have her on.  One more time.  You freaking idiot. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah?  I'm...  That's not me.  I'm 2901.  Persistent cow.  She's great.  Yeah?  What line?  They're telling her.  Hello?  And then she goes...  Someone told her, you're on the air. 
[01:55:00]  She goes, what line?  People understand, right?  We gave her a number to call.  Yeah.  She was still on that number, and assuming that we hung up, so she kept calling the number  we gave her to get back to the show.  But it's busy, because she's still on the line.  God damn, that is so much fun.  I thought that was going to be a really bad version of the silent game, but that turned  out to be a classic.  The silent game takes a weird little turn there, doesn't it?  Who saw that coming?  Who saw that coming? 
[01:55:30]  Hey, Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  Pretty good today.  I was wondering if Chachi was bringing the Fonz to jump over to 40 gallons of Chowder.  Chachi and Fonz?  Yeah.  You think they're going to be jumping over to 40 gallons of Chowder?  I was hoping so.  Very good, Mike.  All right, guys.  Have a good one.  All right.  Hey.  Hey, uh...  Best silent game ever, Ernie from Jersey.  Did all those girls get their pictures taken for the Naughty Ninety contest?  Not yet.  Not yet?  All right.  We're going to have new contestants up from New York, finally. 
[01:56:00]  In a little while.  Go to opandanthony.com.  Let's see what's going on on the FU line today.  All right.  Hey, thanks for calling, and here's the O.P. and Anthony FU line.  I would like to send out an FU to the tool that stole my CD collection this weekend in Vermont.  I hope every stolen note you listen to brings you bad luck and guilt that will follow you around for the rest of your miserable life.  F.U.  Next message.  Yes.  Big f*** you to all your Long Island tools that don't know how to drive. 
[01:56:30]  Get in my lane on the left side.  You know, that's great.  Fine.  Get in my lane.  But you f***ing don't pass the guy?  I'm f***ing flippin'.  F*** you.  Next message.  Hey, this is Eric from New Jersey, and I would like to send a giant f*** you to Kurt Warner and his mullet-haired Bible-beater of a wife.  You know, I'm a Philadelphia Eagle fan, but hey, that's okay.  Go past f*** you, Kurt.  I hope you die.  Next message.  It's 12.30 a.m. in Chicago, and this is Sally. 
[01:57:00]  This was going to be an F.U. for leaving us all with Countdown is Interrupted, but hell, we all know the top two will be the friggin' Beatles and probably Elvis.  So I guess this F.U. is for that stupid magazine and their trite friggin' list.  End of message.  End.  Are you ready?  Opie and Anthony are going to touch you where it's dirty.  Take it like a champ, okay?  The Opie and Anthony show.  And E.W.  They're checking out the show. 
[01:57:30]  The O&A show.  A lot of people outside, huh?  Yes.  Special guests.  Special visitors.  A lot of special visitors today.  God, I'm always, right when we go back on the air, I'm in the middle of one of the best games of my life.  I had up to 60 million, one ball, flying.  You have one ball?  One ball.  That was a joke. 
[01:58:00]  And lots of naked girls outside the studio.  And limo, Annoying Laugh Anthony, really, is here.  What?  What?  Opie, I don't know if this is true, but I'm getting reports that we've been scammed by Rock Hole over there on AAF.  He entered our contest in Boston.  Wouldn't be the first time he dressed up like a little fairy to try to get his ratings up. 
[01:58:30]  Or did his partner dress up as the fairy?  One of the most embarrassing radio bits ever.  And Dave Dickless talked him into it.  Hey, I got an idea.  Guys, you know every Sunday they have the bridal section, who's going to get married and stuff, and they have their picture. 
[01:59:00]  Like Sue and Jonathan, they got engaged and they're from Worcester, Mass.  Right.  Well, we have an idea.  We want you and your partner to dress up.  One is a groom and one is a bride.  And we'll get your names in the paper, because that's the only way we're going to get your names in the paper.  Put your names in and your picture?  I learned that in Omaha, Nebraska.  One of you will have to put on a dress.  Jackass.  Jackass.  That is so uncanny.  Oh, yeah.  A faked wedding.  Yeah.  Hey, Rockhold, Dave Dickless tried to talk Aunt Nye into it, and we didn't do it. 
[01:59:30]  Ugh.  That's the difference right there.  You know what's funny?  A fake miscarriage.  Like if one guy is dressed up like a little bloody pulp, and the other guy is dressed up like a crying wreck of a broad.  That's funny.  That I do.  Linoleum floor, maybe next to the microwave.  That's humorous.  Makes a slapping sound.  It's the oldest radio bit.  A little wet plop.  It's the oldest radio bit in the business.  Yeah.  Where you have two guys that do a show together, one dresses up as a girl. 
[02:00:00]  Hey.  It's great.  Ugh.  Horrid.  All right.  Have fun.  So you brought us girls without IDs?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What is this, Anthony?  What are you doing?  Well, I didn't know.  Rick's, you see, Rick's lying to me, too, because he said that on the air, when he was talking to me,  he says I was supposed to bring somebody with IDs, and I just brought them down.  I never had to do it last time.  You know.  What?  Never had to bring people without IDs.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Forget it, then.  Forget what? 
[02:00:30]  You want them in here?  Yeah.  You said I bring nothing to the show.  Absolutely nothing.  Dude, he's got, I love the one girl.  He's got chicks.  Yeah?  Ugh.  You brought nice chicks?  Yes.  Yeah.  You're a pimp daddy on the side when you're not being annoying?  Yeah.  Rick, he called you a liar.  He called you a liar, by the way.  Rick, you never said that.  You never said that.  Bull!  Bull!  You've never said that to me?  You bull!  Bull!  Because we deal with this with some idiots all the time, and you're the biggest idiot.  We're an idiot.  You're an idiot.  Because now they're syndicated, and now you've got to get IDs and everything else. 
[02:01:00]  No, because the three...  You never had to.  We've always had IDs.  Never, never, never.  Never.  You know what?  We love abusing Rick, but I'll tell you, man.  Rick's right.  Oh, my God.  You're an idiot.  This contest, it took us four months to get it on the table.  You are...  We had lawyers...  Get in the coffin, you fat soldier.  Everybody was on the same page with this contest, because we wanted to do it four months ago.  Yeah.  Lawyers got involved and said, no, we've got to make sure the girls are legal, of age, and  that, you know...  Anytime we have an event that involves pictures going up on a website, there's got to be an 
[02:01:30]  ID.  And anytime...  Actually, not even just pictures on the website.  Whenever we have anything where people are coming up here, we check the IDs and have  them fill out a little form.  Okay.  So, next time I know.  I didn't know.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Pull that liar right now.  You didn't say it on the phone.  No, you didn't.  Yes, I did, dummy.  Come on now.  Will you call it the...  Why?  Because I said, I said, and I repeat, Anthony, just remember they need ID before they can  enter.  That's all...  I didn't hear that.  That was the last line out of my mouth. 
[02:02:00]  I didn't hear that.  All I heard was...  Okay, no problem.  Rick a liar.  Yeah.  I didn't hear that.  He's a jacket.  You are a jacket.  Rick, not a liar.  Shachi, liar.  When you need me, I'm there.  Jacket, Rick, not a liar.  So what?  So when I need you...  Can we throw...  No, no.  You're nothing.  When I need you...  Nothing.  That's fine.  But if I tell you something and you don't listen, now I'm a liar.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Fine.  All right.  You're a fat, so jack-off.  I don't like George Yannis.  He was on the phone.  Arguing with Rick.  That really bothers me.  Danny.  Frenchy.  Hey, you fat, greasy bastard. 
[02:02:30]  You French bastard.  What are you doing over there?  I'm bringing in girls.  What are you doing?  Cooking rats?  Listen, you ass monkey.  You jackass.  Frenchy.  Shut up.  Shut your hole.  You come in here right now.  Shut your hole.  We got police here to escort you back.  Let's go.  Yeah, escorting to your ass.  What do you do for a living?  Fat, so...  Yeah, I know.  Cook another rat, idiot.  Fat, so...  Listen, you greasy bastard.  Why don't you kill yourself?  Okay.  Stupid ass.  Why don't you fall into a knife?  You have a great... 
[02:03:00]  You have a...  You're just one of the greatest characters.  Shut your throat.  You call in and all you do is curse at people.  Did you say greatest characters for us?  What?  He's an idiot.  He's a stupid ass.  When did you become part of us?  I thought...  I thought...  I guess I'm not.  Tell him to kill yourself.  Oh, my God.  Did he say that?  I didn't even catch it.  You're over there.  We're over here.  You're right.  That's not us.  Did he say...  Greatest characters for us.  For us.  For us.  The greatest character.  I want to ask Anthony something.  Go ahead.  Is number still 1-800-GO-F-Y-SELF? 
[02:03:30]  Is that what it is?  It's 1-800-U-F-ING-TOOL.  Yeah.  Go F yourself, you jackass.  Come on in.  Let's go.  You Italian mother F-er.  Hey.  All right.  Anthony's cursing now.  Why are you cursing?  Why are you cursing?  Because you said...  You're letting a French guy get to you?  Let him come in.  Anthony, shut up.  French guy's kicking your ass at me.  Frenchie.  Shut the head up.  Come visit me.  Shut up.  The French guy has more guts than you.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm sure he's assing in his pants right now. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, yeah.  I'm scared of you.  Yeah, huh?  Look at you.  You're losing weight while you speak right now.  You cook rats, you idiot.  Oh, you got him, man.  Keep going.  Yeah, sure.  I'm not here for the comedy.  I'm not here for the comedy.  Exactly.  What are you here for?  Isolate that.  He's losing weight while he speak when I'm so scared.  You're assing in your pants.  You tool bag.  888 7th Avenue, douche bag.  Yeah, huh?  You assing so?  Bring it.  Bring it.  Grease ball. 
[02:04:30]  But you go eat, you go back home and eat your effing cannolis, you tool bag.  He's making fun of the desserts now.  Great, you effing clams and your muscles, you eff.  Make a crepe.  And you meat-a-balls, huh?  How about the meat-a-balls?  Meat-a-balls of parmigian, huh?  You tool bag.  French heads with the Italian accent.  That's true.  All right there, Frenchy.  I think you had it devastated him. 
[02:05:00]  He killed you.  Take it easy.  Can we throw hatchets at you?  No.  What?  No.  Hang up the phone, dummy.  All right, take it easy.  We want to throw hatchets at him, Frenchy.  All right.  I don't like my buddy being made fun of.  Thank you, Norton.  Who?  Anthony.  I don't like my buddy being talked to that way.  Oh, really?  Do you have a spine?  Oh, please.  Yes.  You don't sing bad about nobody.  I happen to like Anthony very much, and he has some friends with him.  For you.  You need a limo, don't you?  No.  Oh, he does.  Absolutely not.  You're trying to get that. 
[02:05:30]  I wouldn't ride one of those funny cars.  Anthony.  You've seen the wow stickers all over the place, right?  He doesn't want to ride in one of your cars, but he wants to ride one of those fine ladies  that he brought in.  A little Spanish one.  Looks like she tingles a lot.  What were you saying, Anthony?  I said, Anthony, you've seen the wow stickers all over.  And, you see, what else does it say on the wow sticker?  It says Opie and Anthony.  Right.  That other, the Anthony after Opie?  Right.  There you go.  See, it's not the Opie and Anthony show, and you say us referring to this show. 
[02:06:00]  See, I think you were a little confused.  I apologize.  Ah, right.  Yeah.  It's your show.  I'm just a squirrel trying to get it.  You're a twat.  I don't mean to bowl.  You're a twat.  Go eat the cannoli, you fag.  He just gave me some new stuff.  Eat the cannoli, you fag.  Meet the bowlers.  Jim, I brought them for you.  Will you shut up?  No.  Now he'll continue talking and carrying on conversations.  I'll have to disagree.  They're here for the O&A show for the Naughty Nighty contest. 
[02:06:30]  I'm happy you brought them, because I like looking at finies.  There you go.  But it's more for the contest.  Why don't we look at some of the girls, then?  All right.  Why don't we do that?  Yeah, why don't you bring these fine ladies in?  Jimmy!  Yo, what's up, O&A?  Hey, Jimmy.  Hey, first of all, Frenchie rules for the fat greaseball.  Yeah.  Second of all, even though Anthony is a retard, you don't need ID.  Opie just got to look at the taint.  Yeah, there you go.  That's true.  We might have to do that today.  Oh.  And Rob Rock is a fag.  All right, Jimmy. 
[02:07:00]  Thank you.  John's pissed off.  Doesn't like Frenchie.  John.  Yo, guys.  What's up, man?  Hey.  This guy has no sense whatsoever.  Why is he always on?  He makes us chuckle.  Oh, how about you make a chuckle?  We got you.  No, no, no, no.  I'm being totally serious.  All right.  We get you.  I mean, he's being ridiculous.  Thanks.  Say elephant boy again, please.  You bring girls down to take dumps before they go on?  What are they doing in the bathroom?  I like that.  What are they doing in the bathroom? 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, you kind of do it like that, don't you?  Yeah, trust.  Hide the paper.  Hide heels and all that.  The 4090s they're putting on.  Find the little rolled up piece of paper.  Dude.  All right.  Oh, nice, dude.  Stop it.  Is he doing his thumbs?  He's tweaking.  He's tweaking himself.  And then he grabs his junk and goes, look at this.  Look, I'm packing.  He wants to see that.  Where did the show go bad today?  Where did it go bad?  Anthony. 
[02:08:00]  Every day there's a lull in the action.  I wonder what caused that today.  Can't put my finger on it right now.  What are you doing?  Oh, my God.  Are you a mess?  You need attention that bad.  Oh, you're the tough guy in high school.  He just popped a bottle of, I guess, champagne.  And the cork went, hit the ceiling, and then it squirts all over.  He got all over his leather jacket. 
[02:08:30]  I'll impress him.  I'm going to light a smoke bomb in the girls' bathroom.  Back up, guys.  We're going to step on a Coke can and wear it like a shoe.  Look at me doing donuts in the school parking lot.  I'll get noticed by the cool kids.  Oh, yeah.  What about this clown, though?  Oh, no.  She's on XC.  Look at that.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, he does.  Look at that.  Hi.  You like that, Norton, huh? 
[02:09:00]  She's very nice.  Sure.  She's very nice.  She's a nice person.  Yeah.  You like that, sure.  And she has a friend who I like very much, too.  I like Dennis Rodman.  Yeah.  Hi.  Wow.  Hi, guys.  How are you doing?  Where are you ladies from?  Where do you want us to be from?  From heaven.  Yeah.  From heaven.  There you go.  God said, we can't say this.  We have to come over here.  Cool.  You talking to the mic?  I am the mic. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, there you go.  Pounce on Norton's lap.  So, what's your deal, girls?  You dance?  What do you do?  Dance at Gallagher's.  You dance at Gallagher's.  27th Street in Queens Boulevard.  Yeah, Gallagher's 2000.  Nice.  Right.  What's the drug of choice, girls?  What do you like?  What do you like?  Hennessy.  What do you got?  You like the Hennessy?  Hey, Uma, what are you taking?  Uma Thurman.  She got the Uma Pulp Fiction hairdo going there, man. 
[02:10:00]  No, that's good.  Don't worry about that.  That works.  I'm not worried.  I'm not a big fan of the...  I'll take out of the compliment.  Not a big fan of the...  Yes, I do.  No.  All right.  Shut up.  You can't use that language.  All right.  You can't say...  Don't say anything.  Don't say it.  Don't say it.  All right.  Don't say it.  Don't say it.  I'm turning off all the mics.  Don't say it.  Oh, my God.  Don't say anything.  We've lost a lot of delay.  We're going to Van Halen in a couple seconds.  If you keep saying it.  Stripper gone wild.  Stripper gone wild. 
[02:10:30]  See, it always happens.  You say one thing, and then you go, oh, okay, I'll say it another way, and then it's always  wrong, and we end up having to dump out of the show.  When strippers talk.  It's not what you say.  It's how you say it.  Right, right, right.  When strippers talk on Fox.  I'm an intern.  We raped the intern upstairs.  Yes, she did.  I'm an intern.  Where are you going?  She absolutely did.  Yay, Mule.  So, what are you doing now?  Oh, Norton.  Woody for the intern.  There you go.  I'm, who's this?  So, now.  Who am I jumping on? 
[02:11:00]  That's Jim Norton.  That's Jim Norton.  She doesn't even know who she's jumping on.  Are there any big men in the house?  Wait, he's little?  I didn't did it.  I don't know.  I don't know.  She didn't did it.  Have you ever given oral treats for money?  No, it wasn't me.  No?  You didn't?  No?  I didn't did it.  You didn't did it?  It wasn't her.  No?  No, the devil made me do it.  Have you ever given sexual favors for money?  No, I didn't did it.  Would you? 
[02:11:30]  Because I have money.  Depends what he's considered sexual favors.  Norton's got a lot of money.  How much for a Hummer?  Who's Norman?  How much for a Hummer?  For a Hummer?  Boy, this one's got a potty mouth.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  If Norton had a pocket full of cash, what do you mean, if potty mouth on this nutty gal?  If he had a pocket full of cash, she wouldn't be sitting there.  If he had a pocket full of cash, and he wanted oral treats, what would it run him? 
[02:12:00]  Just the oral treats.  Nothing else.  Yeah, just that.  What would it cost?  Nothing.  I'm taking him with me.  Goodbye.  Bye.  He's a method actor.  My God, man.  I'm easy.  Oh, you're just easy.  I like that.  I'm loose.  My mommy said I'm loose.  You're loose?  That's something you want to hear from your mommy.  Your mommy said you're loose?  It is, actually. 
[02:12:30]  When did you enter the wonderful world of sexual activity?  I started five days ago, I'll tell you that.  Yeah?  You can't associate with the rest of the world.  So I'm like a virgin.  Children from school.  Yeah?  Oh, you got it.  She's a little odd, this one.  But I like her.  She's all over Jim Norton.  That's nice.  Yeah, she doesn't know or care who I am.  She's just, you know, happy to be somewhere.  Are you packing?  Do we have any Hennessy in the house?  Oh, God.  We all like a little bit of Hennessy. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah?  There you go.  I have to say hello to this lovely.  Why don't you give the girls some Hennessy?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, no.  Are you Spanish, too?  I'm Latin, yeah.  Hey, ladies, get naked if you like.  Latina.  Yeah, you know something, girls?  Feel free to get completely naked for Jim Norton.  Does she speak English?  What was that?  What?  I didn't speak English.  No, I didn't know what she said.  Oh, look at that, right?  Wow.  Norton's got a couple of hands full of ass there now, don't you?  Wow, wait.  She's manipulating himself.  He's doing a great job.  There's the top is, that's very nice. 
[02:13:30]  I'm looking, you have some type of implantations, do you?  Just a little.  Come on, I bought them.  Well, that's fine.  That's fine, Andy.  What size do they call that?  This is called a D, as in David.  Oh, right.  Why don't you pull that off and show Mr. Norton this one over here.  What you're all about.  She's nutty.  She likes it.  They're all nutty girls.  I think she's half the time.  Where do you get half?  Yes, I do.  Where do you get half?  Gallagher 2000 off of 37th Street. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, of course.  Queens Boulevard.  Hell yeah.  In Queens.  Yeah.  Go Queens, man.  You certainly will.  You better.  Yeah.  Come down with the tip of the iceberg.  All right.  There you go.  Little Latina girl, are you?  Yeah, Latina's are the best.  Oh, yeah?  I can vouch for that.  Oh, how about that?  I've never been with a Latin girl, ever.  No?  Oh, my God.  You haven't lived.  You haven't lived.  You haven't lived. 
[02:14:30]  They always reject me.  They're like, no, you got too much money.  Oh.  Are you kidding me?  Stop with the curse.  No, hold on.  We're on the air.  You can't say the F word.  Oh, don't say that.  There's laws.  Shoot them with the tripod.  There's laws.  We're not prejudiced.  We're not prejudiced.  We love too much money.  No, but every Latin girl is like, oh, Jim.  We're not prejudiced.  We love too much money.  We're not prejudiced.  We're not prejudiced.  We love too much money.  Right.  I think the more, the merrier.  That's what you say.  I like that expression, too.  That's good.  A little...  God, you are thick. 
[02:15:00]  You are the thickest.  You're not too bright upstairs.  What's your name?  What's your name?  Rose.  Rose.  Rose, what's your problem?  You've got to be reasonable.  You've got to think for more than...  Your attention span has to go a little further than a microsecond.  When we say you can't say the F word, you can't then turn around and go, what the F are they giving me?  We will try.  I'm hard and hard and hard and hard.  Oh, my gosh. 
[02:15:30]  Who has better concentration?  Rose or T.T. Clyde?  Look at Norm.  Get out of here, man.  Why don't we...  We just excluded Norman, Rio, and Rose.  Norman.  Norman.  That's good.  That looks better.  We just excluded Norman.  That looks really good, too.  The court papers are, who's Norman that raped this girl?  We don't know any Norman.  I don't miss my news.  All right.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  You girls are party girls. 
[02:16:00]  What was the problem with the drink, Rose?  It's strong.  I didn't, didn't.  And I just...  She just went...  I said the F word.  She tried, though.  I wanted to, but I didn't.  She goes, it's strong.  No F word.  Listen.  I know it's hard for you not to say the F word.  It's extremely hard.  You say it all the time.  It's usually followed by me.  Don't we have a beep thing on this?  We've been hitting it.  It's a beep, beep.  We're out of the beep thing.  Oh, what is going...  Look at what she's doing.  We're out of the beep thing. 
[02:16:30]  She's gyrating all over...  Oh, honey.  All over Norman.  She's missing my mule by about two feet, though, because of the chair here.  Believe me.  She's grinding all over Norman.  Yeah.  You have some chloroform to give her there, Norman?  I'm going to take her across the country.  Norman likes you.  Nice call back.  Mommy, say hi.  You remind me of my mother.  My mommy said yes.  What's your mommy doing?  Whatever her mommy says, she does. 
[02:17:00]  My mommy thinks I'm loose.  Yeah?  But what is your...  My mommy said don't...  What does your mommy do?  Don't associate with the rest of the children.  You're loose.  Really?  Oh, yeah, kid.  All right.  So you like...  This girl, I love her.  I want to know, like, when she started.  When did you start dancing?  Three weeks ago.  No, stop it.  Seriously.  Three weeks ago.  You just started dancing?  Yeah.  We're both virgins.  What were you doing before that?  I is a virgin.  What were you doing before that?  I is, I am, you are.  Same difference.  She's not a virgin. 
[02:17:30]  Why not?  A virgin today, maybe.  Maybe.  Probably not.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  You just said the S word.  Stop.  Yes, you did.  No, I didn't.  You did.  Not, Anthony.  You said...  You did it because I heard it.  Get a backbone, Jim.  Get a backbone.  You're right.  He's got a front bone.  Don't worry about the backbone.  You jellyfish over there.  I really am a little meaty worm.  Michael.  Hey.  Norton.  Yes, sir.  I'll give you $5,000 if you chloroform these people, the two of them. 
[02:18:00]  Five grand.  Take it in the back and club them like a baby seal, all right?  Why don't you just be quiet for a second?  They're nice.  I want to know what do we get out of it.  I don't care.  Just quiet.  You're annoying.  They're not annoying.  And they're hanging out with Anthony.  That's because you're not even looking at us, buddy.  They're good girls, sir.  Hey, Michael.  Have you ever tried to be quiet after you did some skating?  We'll try it someday.  Okay.  Light.  What do you like?  What do you like?  The ecstasy?  You take any of that?  No.  No?  She's coke?  She's skating.  Valium.  She's annex.  Skater? 
[02:18:30]  None of that.  What do you like?  Skater.  She likes to be touched and everything else?  You're on the E, aren't you, sweetheart?  Who's on the radio?  Shut up.  Don't worry.  Jesus, they're so annoying.  I want to kill them.  She really hates me, this one, but she's a drooper.  Honey, with my luck, you'd end up dead first.  If I can interject for one sec.  Norton, she was talking on the limo ride here that she had to go to the bathroom really  bad, and she wanted to give someone your...  Right, right.  We know, we know, we know.  Oh, cool, because I know there's nothing in that bloodstream that I wouldn't want. 
[02:19:00]  He gave you up, Rio.  He gave you up.  Where did you pick these girls up from?  Oh, no, it's limo, Anthony.  It's annoying laugh.  Annoying laugh, Anthony got them.  They got them at this...  That's what I'm saying.  Anthony, where did you pick these girls up?  Did they attract it to you because you've got the same personalities?  What?  No.  No, they're not gals.  Annoying laugh, Anthony.  Can you even wreck a radio show with strippers?  I know.  I know.  I thought that was impossible.  Gala here, 22,000.  You guys have had annoying strippers on before, but these girls are just...  How come if you're strippers, you still have your clothes on? 
[02:19:30]  Meanwhile, this is the guy that spends a hundred bucks on us.  I want to know why they still have their clothes on if they're strippers.  I know.  Hey, we got Patrick...  Because we haven't gotten paid yet.  Anthony, pay them and have them take their clothes.  Do you know...  First of all, I want to tell you something about the barter system.  Let me tell you how this works.  You plug...  Yeah, listen.  You plug the club you're dancing at.  You've already done it so many times.  Do you know what a minute worth of air time on this very show goes for?  It's a lot of money.  Hello, Butch.  We're doing our job.  The trade-off...  Hello, Butch. 
[02:20:00]  The trade-off is that we need a little nudity to spice up the studio.  We're not those type of girls.  Oh, lovely.  All right, Patrick Bateman wants in here.  Patrick Bateman's checking in from American Psycho.  Patrick?  Yes, this is Patrick Bateman.  I'm 27 years old and I live in the American Gardens building on West 81st Street.  That's right, Patrick.  I'd like to take these girls to dinner at Dorcia.  Can you get a table?  I have a reservation for 9 o'clock.  You sure you have a reservation?  Very hard to get a table there. 
[02:20:30]  Yes, and then afterwards we can put some Huey Lewis and the News on.  And then what?  I have the follow-up album 4.  It's their maturation album coming after sports.  Right.  I figured I could lay down some tarps, nail them to the floor, and let the rat loose.  Oh, remember that.  No, honey, with the kind of girl that I am, you first.  Ah.  Rose is now looking better.  Oh, Rose is solid. 
[02:21:00]  Look at those.  They're very, very lovely.  Yes.  Very nice.  I would go to see them tonight.  And she's got the tat work all around her belly.  It goes all the way around her back with roses.  That's two wild orchids, one in the front, one in the back.  Oh, is that what that is?  Hey, where's Rick to take their pictures?  Yeah.  Wow.  Where is that angry, well-muscled, Reagan-haired Spaniard?  Could you turn that round thing toward her?  He's welcome here.  If you could.  There you go.  Thank you.  Perfect.  Let me... 
[02:21:30]  Let's get Rick in here.  Okay.  To take some pictures.  Rick, do your job.  Photograph these beauties.  There you go.  I think we have to take a break.  Do we?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  They are so annoying.  What's the matter?  Holy Jesus.  They are the most annoying.  All right, your girls are going to get your pictures taken.  We're going to pay the bills.  Yeah.  This is the best thing.  Daddy's going to pay the bills.  Her head is now in Norton's lap.  Dude, a guy in a barrel just shot out the helmet. 
[02:22:00]  A guy in a barrel.  Nice technique.  I'm good with the head.  I hold the head.  Oh, no, the head of a human.  All right.  Jumping Jiminy.  I'm going to turn their mics off.  There you go.  All right.  I'm going to turn Jim's off, too.  Okay.  Just me and you again, Ed.  Just me and you.  All right.  There you go.  Lady, Anthony, take the ladies out into the waiting room where they can wait. 
[02:22:30]  There you go.  And we're going to pay...  Take it out to the waiting room.  We're going to pay a annoying laugh.  Anthony back in the next segment as we throw hatchets at his back.  Oh, my God.  That's...  Scrap right here.  What?  You could scrap.  You guys have no idea what you're missing.  Dude, you have no backbone, though.  Dude, I'm a pervert.  It's so naughty.  Let me tell you something.  If you weren't getting what you were getting, it would be equally as annoying to you.  I am and it is.  I don't care.  I'd block it out.  Do like a childhood episode.  I'm just eating cotton candy and doing a better thing. 
[02:23:00]  My uncle isn't in the room with me.  This isn't happening to me.  I'm not face down in a pillow with my little baseball cleats on while the coach is teaching  me a lesson.  We're going to have to get a straitjacket for you.  So, you leave your...  Yeah, we can keep your hands over there.  Dude, what a good day this is.  It's a great show.  Kevin gave me this Ozzy Osbourne doll, which I don't know who it's from, but thank you.  Oh, isn't that great?  There you go.  Can I just thank Dave at Time Warp Comics, Cedar Grove, New Jersey, 973-857-9788. 
[02:23:30]  Thank you, buddy.  It's beautiful.  No, it's not me.  I'm plugging him because he...  All right, all right.  We're going back to the FU line and we'll regroup.  Hey, thanks for calling.  And here's the Opie and Anthony FU line.  I want to give a big f*** you out to Fred Durst and Limp Bizkit for making me and my  boys stand alone for over 12 hours to get the position for a minute to scam this contest.  You ain't going to pick nobody.  You're just going to get your goddamn shooting position to suck up your band anyway.  Re-invent my ass.  F*** you.  Next message. 
[02:24:00]  I'd like to give a big f*** you to all these chicks here in New York.  We're getting our asses kicked in the Naughty Nighty contest and we're letting these  toothless bitches over in Cleveland kick our ass.  So all you chicks out there who think you're so goddamn hot, well, you know what?  F*** you, New York bitches.  Get your ass in there.  Get naked for Opie and Anthony.  Next message.  Yeah, I'm sending out a big f*** you out to the New England Patriots team and their fans  who think that they have a chance in hell of beating the Rams on Sunday. 
[02:24:30]  I don't give a f*** who's your quarterback.  Whether it's Bledsoe or Brady, it's not going to matter.  By halftime, the game will be over.  The Rams have beaten them once already this year and they're going to do it again.  The Patriots are going to let you down just like the Red Sox have for the past 83 years.  Soon it'll be 84.  F*** you.  End of message.  You've got a war face?  What the heck?  Ah!  That's a war face.  Now let me see your war face.  Oh! 
[02:25:00]  F*** you didn't convince me.  Let me see your real war face.  No!  You don't scare me.  Work on it.  Jackass.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And he...  Damn it.  You're checking out the mess we call the Opie and Anthony Show.  There are naked women all over the place now.  New York coming back strong today as far as the Naughty Nighty contest goes.  I lost count.  There's at least, what, eight girls out there?  Yeah.  At least.  At least.  Half of them are naked. 
[02:25:30]  Those two that were just in here before.  One grinding on Norton and the other one.  They're dancers that Limo Anthony brought.  Thank you so much.  I'm trying, you know something, in between the show here, in between when the commercials  are playing, I'd like to get out now.  We got the new pinball machine.  And I want to play a few games.  Have a little game.  Right.  And I don't care.  Norton's on the couch with two girls.  They're grinding on him.  The one is so annoying.  She's like, you want to see my T's? 
[02:26:00]  You want to see my...  I'm like, yeah, yeah, sure.  And I don't know how you're looking.  I'm paying attention to the game.  She's like, eh.  She puts her hands up on the corner of the pinball game and starts, like, rocking back  and forth, tilting the goddamn thing.  I was playing a great game.  Annoying.  You want anything?  Yeah.  And she goes, you want me to pin your balls?  Pin.  I'm playing pinball.  I go, I don't even know what you're talking about.  What does that even mean?  And she kept saying it.  I'm playing pinball.  You want to pin balls? 
[02:26:30]  What does that mean?  I thought it was cute.  She thinks it's a funny joke.  Shut up.  I'm playing my goddamn game.  Norton was playing a video game.  God damn it.  Norton was playing a video game during the commercials, Ann.  You should see him work a joystick.  He's manipulating his joystick.  It's called Keep a Geyser from Ruining Your Boxer.  It's a little game I play.  There's some girls out there that are, like, bi.  They do, like, lesbian shows and stuff.  Well, that's fun.  Oh, really, Jim?  We would have never known.  Grow a spine. 
[02:27:00]  We've lost a contestant, too.  Oh, no, four.  All right, well, yeah, let me stop the music first.  Some people on Instant Feedback have already commented.  Well, they're keeping tabs on our contestants.  The latest contestant is up, Storm, I believe.  And they're putting pictures up as we go along here.  Wow.  Storm's pictures are up.  And she decided to blow off most of her naughty nightie.  Wow. 
[02:27:30]  Wow.  Nice pictures, right?  Yeah, she's hot.  Yeah.  Very nice.  Holy jeez.  Okay, you go to the second set.  Second set, a little something that you're not going to get from the Cleveland girls.  Let's just put it that way.  Holy Toledo.  Is he Cleveland?  That's good.  She showed up late.  What, did she have to wait to get out of school?  Look at those pictures.  That's great.  I like any girl that has ID in her lunch box.  A little lunch box.  All right, Anthony, a couple things really fast.  This just in.  Should I read it? 
[02:28:00]  Yes.  Yeah, well, one contestant pulled out.  Can you guess which one it is?  It looks like a lawyer got involved because this is kind of like lawyer speak.  It's worded in a way where it may be able to be used in a court of law.  In the future.  It says, John Rossi, I, Adrian, a last name, last name, am withdrawing myself and my pictures  from the Naughty Nighty Contest for Opie and Anthony.  I realize I can't be participating in this again after I have withdrawn.  My number was 44, and I am from Boston. 
[02:28:30]  Thank you.  So, um.  Signed, Adrian, blah, blah.  We have lost.  Does this mean we.  Boston lost again.  Representation.  We once again, Boston does not have a contestant.  Come on, Boston.  But what does that have to do with anything?  She writes my number and puts her dress size.  What does that have to do with anything?  Oh, Jim.  Jim.  Be nice.  Guys.  Be nice.  Hey.  Foz.  Yeah.  Foz from Cleveland. 
[02:29:00]  Check it in.  You guys remember Teen Shannon?  Teen.  Hi, guys.  Teen Shannon.  Oh, of course.  Yeah.  She's back, and we got, what, three more outfits?  Three more outfits, and I'm showing a little boobie.  Oh, let me look at Teen Shannon.  Oh, there she is.  She was the one in pink.  Wait, wait.  No.  Wait, turn around.  Turn around.  Please.  This one.  Oh, we love Teen Shannon.  She's the one that everyone says she looks like little Winnie Cooper.  You look great in the pink.  Oh, no.  Wait till you see these new... 
[02:29:30]  Yes, I'm not the best looking teen I'm there now.  I don't know who is.  Oh, the best.  She's the best looking.  There's some competition.  I'm getting cocky.  Oh, cocky.  Cocky.  Cocky.  I like that.  Guys, you cannot say that Cleveland is not representing now, man.  All right.  You're back.  You're back in our good graces.  Right.  All right.  Thank you, Cleveland.  Thank you, Fawz.  And thank you, Teen Shannon.  I'd rather have her get bukkake.  That'd be really nice.  Bukake joke. 
[02:30:00]  Wow.  Boy, I see a link titled Bukake.  You got to click on it.  And they go, oh, Jesus.  You have to.  Yeah.  80 angry bad World War II fighters.  My feet's small.  I can't run.  Oh, my God.  Oyster sauce?  Oh, those little stink feet.  Chachi.  It's Bukachi calling.  Hey, Bukachi. 
[02:30:30]  Chachi?  We got another contestant.  We took the pictures.  She already left.  Okay.  I don't like Boston.  Don't stink.  I'm leaving.  Chachi, we already had your one contestant pull out of the contest.  Pull out.  We'll pull out.  And now you're saying the next one.  She's like a six or so.  What'd you give the first one, who's now using her mouth to plow the mass pike? 
[02:31:00]  We can trade you a few Philly girls.  We need those Philly girls.  You know, I'm sitting on the website of Founding Museum.  I'm getting a Husky.  Well, and I'm sure Boston and BCN is not behind any of the girls.  I'm embarrassed.  Well, tomorrow when we broadcast live from WBCN in Boston, the ladies can show up with their naughty 90s.  Right.  We'll get the job done that you couldn't, Chachi.  I have a beautiful redhead here, and she has a huge chest, but she refuses to do anything for us. 
[02:31:30]  Good God.  Hold on.  China's pictures are up on opianthony.com.  Oh, let me see.  Another girl representing in New York, and man, she's nice.  She's fresh there.  She's nice.  Oh, dude, she's sexy, man.  She's not that Asian.  Her and the other girl are the ones that are up to the hole.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Yeah.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Does she have to wear the grasses on the first shot?  All right, Chachi.  I am depressed.  I'm leaving.  Yeah, you should be. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, Chachi, Chachi.  What?  Chowder Bowl tomorrow?  40 gallons to start.  Yeah.  Non-stop chowder eating.  And what do the fine listeners of the Opian Anthony show have to do for their chance to win the Super Bowl tickets?  Show up at 1265 Boylston Street, 2 o'clock tomorrow.  Everybody gets a number, random drawing, 10 contestants.  Each of them eating famous clam chowder for four hours, and the one who does not regurgitate goes to the Super Bowl.  Well, they've got to eat the chowder every 10 minutes. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, is that it?  Every 10 minutes?  A bowl every 10 minutes.  Oh, yeah.  It's a big bowl.  Every 10 minutes.  It's a big bowl.  I'm going to go to America.  It's Italian.  Sorry.  All right, Chachi.  Later.  There you go.  Poor Chachi.  He's very sad today.  I think he's going to go to the secret room, if you know what I mean.  Ah, yeah.  A little attitude adjustment.  Where everyone goes to dull the pain a little bit, to count the stolen CDs, and where everyone  goes to forget their name. 
[02:33:00]  Hey.  What are you doing over there?  What are you doing?  He's making phone calls.  He's on a cell phone in the studio.  You're calling in the studio.  Are we interrupting you?  Dude, this is a highly rated program.  Oh, he's leaving.  Wait, dude, dude, dude.  Oh, he's mad.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, he's so mad.  He needs to text it so bad.  You know that person that, like, is in your neighborhood that gets a cell phone and makes  sure he calls people in front of others?  Right in front of you.  Right.  Just to say, hey, look at me.  I'm important.  I got a cell phone. 
[02:33:30]  Right.  It never rings for anybody calling him.  He's always making the calls.  So, that's what does.  It's always an idiotic, annoying call.  Yeah, I'll be home in a little while, Ma.  All right.  That's good.  You're 40.  Uh, it's 633, Anthony.  Hey, yeah.  Chrissy.  What happened?  Yeah.  What's going on?  Why are you calling us today?  Oh, for a lot of reasons.  I tried so hard to call you guys last night.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Because Dennis Leary was on.  Yes.  And I actually have met him before, and I know some of his friends from out here in  Worcester, and I have, God, so many local references. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, he'd remember you, too.  Well, maybe.  Oh.  But I also have, I think I have something new for you guys.  All right.  What's that?  Um, have you ever had the six o'clock queef done with props?  Props?  Yeah.  Like what?  Well, if it's, uh...  Well, I don't say what it is.  Let's hear your prop.  Okay.  You've got to play the song first.  No.  No, let's hear the prop first.  We're very picky with our new feature. 
[02:34:30]  Um...  We don't want to burn it out.  It's a wind instrument.  A flute?  No.  A what?  A whistle.  You have a whistle?  It's not a button.  It's not a fart.  It's not too sweet.  It's not too tart.  It's six o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  Blow out the candles.  Make a wish.  It's like a fart, but smells like fish.  It's six o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  Undo your pants.  Let them drop to the floor.  Tense up and let yourself...  All right, Chrissy, do not explain what you're doing. 
[02:35:00]  Just do it, okay?  Okay, hold on.  Here we go.  Everyone quiet.  The 634 queef.  Shh, shh, shh.  Okay, did you hear it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um...  How about again?  Huh?  I only heard whistle, though.  Well, what do you think made it whistle?  Yeah, but then...  Oh, okay. 
[02:35:30]  It's not a verb.  It's not a fart.  It's not too sweet.  It's not too tart.  It's six o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  Blow out the candles.  Make a wish.  It's like a fart, but smells like fish.  It's six o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  Undo your pants.  Let them drop to the floor.  Tense up and let yourself roar.  Queef.  Thank you to Chrissy.  Pete, what's going on?  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Pete the chef.  Yo, listen.  I work at the Crab House down on Park Avenue on, like, 22nd Street. 
[02:36:00]  I don't know if you guys know.  Well, we have clam chowder and all the Spanish guys.  Like, we always talk about, oh, you can't eat more.  You can't eat a lot of this.  Don't eat a lot of this.  They're like, oh, whatever.  You know, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Well, we bet them one night to eat two bowls in 20 minutes.  They ruined the kitchen.  This one guy, Jose, I swear to God, he went all over the grill, all over the hot shelf, everything.  And from now on, it's been like the bet in the kitchen.  Everybody's been trying to eat two bowls in 20 minutes, and it's, like, impossible. 
[02:36:30]  It's disgusting.  You guys are going to have...  This content's got to last longer than two bowls of that fine, chunky...  See, I can't do it like you, Anthony.  It's the creamy...  Creamy, delicious, milky, chunky, thick clam chowder.  See, what we got, what you got to do is you got to make sure you don't have any kind of, you know, like, bacon or ham,  because we put a little bit of bacon in there, and it just sits right in your stomach, and, you know, 
[02:37:00]  you guys might need some diapers, too, tomorrow.  I'm happy to be an only dream.  It's going to be a bad, bad scene.  All right, man.  Take care, guys.  Good luck tomorrow.  Thank you, Pete the Chef.  All right, why don't we take a break, and we'll come back.  We'll play What Do We Learn?  Girls getting their pictures taken outside.  You know what?  We didn't do anything today.  Eh, well, I think someone might have learned something, though.  We were supposed to do Clinton Goes Wild, and...  Well, that was supposed to tie into the clone call, but... 
[02:37:30]  And we had a cute little thing we were going to do with, like, Clinton Jackass.  Uh-huh.  A little Clinton Jackass thing.  Yeah, we never got to that.  We still haven't talked to Reagan.  Reagan's birthday is...  He was supposed to call him about...  Three days ago.  Three days ago?  Well, he won't know anyway.  He's not going to...  Maybe that's why he hasn't called.  He's not going to know the difference, eh?  Holy ass.  This is a coup right here.  What's that?  Uh, 12-year-old Gary, real fast, because we've got to take a break.  Yo, I just want to say I'm going to come in Tuesday.  What, you're coming into the show on Tuesday? 
[02:38:00]  Coming into the show on Tuesday.  The Islanders aren't playing Tuesday, are they?  Uh, are they?  Oh, no.  Uh...  Are they?  Are they?  Are they?  I don't know.  Who are they playing on Tuesday?  Sub-500?  I don't know.  Well, Gary, cool.  We'll see you, uh, we'll see you Tuesday.  All right.  All right, I better get some tickets to hand you on Tuesday.  All right, see you.  All right, bye. 
[02:38:30]  What?  Chris, what's going on?  Chris?  Yes?  What's up?  Well, who's that Rick making fun of Anthony?  What?  He was a lot of games that Anthony was going around with us.  Take the big C out of your mouth and try it again.  What?  I don't have a C out of my mouth.  I'm saying, who's Rick that's making fun of Anthony?  Rick is our producer.  Yeah, he wish he had the good Anthony have around him. 
[02:39:00]  What did Lou Ferrigno say?  Chris, is this you?  Get off the phone.  Dude, are you trying to...  Is this your driver?  Are you trying to do...  You're trying to do bits now for us.  Why is your driver calling on the timeline?  He just called him.  I didn't call him in case of a problem.  I didn't call him.  You called him and tried to...  Chris, did I call you?  Chris?  Hello, Chris.  Can I tell you to call him?  24-1-1.  What?  I got the phone number from information.  No, you got the phone number from me when I was up here last time.  Did I tell you to call him here just now?  Never.  Thank you.  Did you run to a phone with your exploding shoes? 
[02:39:30]  Hold on.  Wait a minute.  Stinky's on the scene.  Yes, Stinky?  This guy called.  I said, Limo A, your driver's on the phone.  He's like, no.  It's Chris.  He knew who it was before he even talked to him.  You only have one?  Yeah, that's my driver.  That's my guy.  Hey, Chris, where are you from?  Me?  Yeah.  I'm New York.  No, where are you from with that accent?  From Armenia.  Armenia?  Yes.  All right.  I thought maybe he was exploding shoes or something. 
[02:40:00]  All right.  So Anthony pays you to drive him and be his friend?  Is that it?  Thank you, Chris, for wrecking the show as bad as your boss over there.  I never wreck a show.  You don't like our show?  Whatever.  I said I never wreck a show.  I'll wreck a show.  Wrecking like, whatever.  What the heck?  Opie and Anthony.  At the last supper, they would have wiped their asses with the tablecloth.  That's just what Christ wanted. 
[02:40:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, North, thanks for throwing us a bone and coming back in the studio in time for broadcast.  I always have to leave.  You know that, man.  I answer email and I used to go smoke, but now I don't smoke, so I have to go do something else.  Of course.  Rub you on a gal.  Oh, yeah, why not?  Hey, meo.  Are we interrupting your playtime?  Technically, yes, but it's fine.  I don't mind.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Only a few minutes left in the program.  Yes.  Then we're heading off to Boston. 
[02:41:00]  Big show tomorrow from the WBCN studios.  We cannot wait.  The Chowder Bowl goes down tomorrow.  Oh, yeah.  And comes up.  It's going to be great.  And the Naughty Nighty contest continues tomorrow.  We will be accepting girls in the Boston area tomorrow, right, with their Naughty Nineties.  And we'll take the pictures personally because Chachi is doing a horrendous job.  It's like the master is coming to Boston, Rick.  Rick, we'll show Chachi how to make these girls look beautiful.  And you're going to just see beautiful girls out of Boston because Rick is going to be taking the pictures tomorrow. 
[02:41:30]  Right.  With his inimitable Rick style.  Hey, man.  We give him props.  There's no abuse here.  It took a long time for Rick to learn how to take the pictures.  I don't know.  I don't know what I could possibly do to save Boston.  What would you do with the new contestant, Shawna, out of Boston?  Erase every shot.  No, what?  You know something?  She's all right.  I think Chachi really put her in a bad light. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  First of all, she's on a filthy couch with bad lighting.  Look at the wall behind it.  This looks like a biker club where she's ready to be banged in.  Wow.  You know?  And look at that shot, Chachi.  Jesus Christ.  Maybe she's a little banged up because she just fought Sugar Ray Robinson.  I mean, the lighting is horrible.  You've got to think her doomper looks better than that.  Nice camel toe, though.  There you go.  Yeah, see?  The camel toe shot is kind of nice. 
[02:42:30]  That's a whole foot.  You can see the whole thing right there.  There's something going on there.  Hey, where's that girl that wants to defend herself?  She's getting a reshoot.  Contestant number one that didn't show her face.  I'm being molested outside.  By who?  By who?  I don't know.  By who?  Sweet Rio?  Oh, those two homeless guys.  She's grabbing me.  I'm like, okay.  Terrific.  That's right.  They can't keep their hands off you?  Hungry guys.  Yeah, basically.  She's like, hi, nice to meet you. 
[02:43:00]  And her hands are going.  I'm like, all right.  Look, she's pushing her ass against the lingo.  Dude, it's nice.  You've got to love that.  You know what, though?  You're putting your girls in all week.  You've got that jumper.  Look at that.  She's so friggin' annoying.  Listen, listen.  They're going to kill us.  We've got two minutes left.  So what do you have to say?  Okay.  20 seconds.  Contestant number one, Daphna, and I didn't show my face.  So I learned my lesson, more face is more gooder.  In most cases, yes.  So I got a lot of ass.  More talking, less gooder.  Shut up.  You'll notice that. 
[02:43:30]  I got a lot of ass from opianthony.com message board, and I decided I'm going to come back  in into a reshoot and show my face, and I changed my naughty nightie to this.  Hey, very nice.  There you go.  That's better.  Very smart to cover up the tummy.  Very nice.  That's more of a nightie.  Very nice.  That's the only part is I got tan lines in.  Okay.  We like that.  Tan lines. 
[02:44:00]  No one cares about the tan lines.  You suck that line in so quick, Opie.  Very much gooder.  Much gooder.  We look forward to seeing your face on the internet.  Yes.  There you go.  I just want to clear up my name at opianthony.com.  Will, love me.  All right.  Tom from Billy, I learned you should tug on your junk before you put it on TV.  He also learned Limo Ant is one of us, but he's not there for the comedy.  And Norman likes to use chloroform to bring girls across the country.  Norman.  Jersey Gary from Oz.  He learned Ant has 60 million and one ball. 
[02:44:30]  Well, Foz and Cleveland just don't get it.  Rule number one of the O&A.  Right.  Also, the new contestant from Sacramento is Wilson the Volleyball.  O&A prep for today's show at Legal Seafood.  Silent game.  Always funny.  Great silent game today.  George from Jersey City.  I learned Norman has no backbone, but he's got one in the front.  Mike from the Bronx.  I learned the best defense for the silent game is the reverse silent game.  I learned Boston takes their pictures with the Hubble.  Oh, Kevin from West Babylon. 
[02:45:00]  I learned that more gooder is more better than horsing around.  Norton rules Jim Voss.  Rich Voss blows.  Okay.  And Bobby from Queens.  Bobby from Queens.  Bobby from Queens.  I learned Rick is a Reagan-haired Spaniard.  Wow.  Look at what's going on over there.  Hot girls.  Hi.  There they go.  Hi, girls.  They're going to town, aren't they?  They're doing lessons.  Wow.  You're friends, aren't you?  Dude, we got 20 seconds.  Where do you dance, ladies?  Jim.  Paradise.  Paradise, paradise, paradise. 
[02:45:30]  Got to get that plug in.  Paradise, paradise, paradise.  Where's Paradise?  33rd Street.  33rd Street.  33rd.  6th Avenue.  And 6th Avenue.  It's right here, local in New York.  All right.  Hot.  And we got 10 seconds.  Yep.  Chowder Bowl tomorrow.  Just show up outside BCN starting at 2 for your chance to win a trip to the Super Bowl,  okay?  It's going to be great fun.  And girls, with your naughty 90s in the Boston area, we need you desperately tomorrow to show up  at the station.  Yes.  And we'll take the pictures personally, okay?  Cool.  Peace. </pre>
