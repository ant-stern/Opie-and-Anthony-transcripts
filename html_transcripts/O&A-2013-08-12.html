<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

This Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a chaotic mix of pre-recorded interviews and live segments.  The show opened with a *Breaking Bad* themed segment hosted by Eric "E-Rock."  E-Rock played previously recorded interviews with various cast members.  Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman) was interviewed in-studio. The conversation covered his role, his initial fear of being killed off early, his research involving time spent with meth users and visits to rehab facilities, and the show's surprising plot twists.  The interview veered off-topic into humorous tangents, including a discussion of a fart in the studio. Bob Odenkirk (Saul Goodman) joined via phone, discussing his role, his career (including *Mr. Show*, *Saturday Night Live*, and anecdotes about Chris Farley), and the transition from comedy to drama.  Both interviews were marked by interruptions and digressions.  A later segment featured Bob Odenkirk again, in a different interview segment,  further discussing his *Breaking Bad* role, the Emmy nominations,  the show's dark storyline, and the challenges of dramatic acting compared to comedy (including *Mr. Show* and *Funny or Die*).  He also touched on the difficulties of memorizing lengthy monologues and the show's strict script security. The hosts also engaged in a discussion about the 1990s comedy boom and the contrast between the number of gigs available and their quality.  Bryan Cranston (Walter White) then joined the studio.  The conversation focused on his portrayal of Walter White, including his character's transformation, the show's dark tone, and the audience's shifting sympathies.  Cranston detailed his preparation for the role, including his backstory creation and character design (the "impotent mustache"). He also discussed acting challenges, compared his work style to others (mentioning Louis C.K.), and touched upon other projects (*Rock of Ages*, *Madagascar 3*).  The segment also briefly touched on the Fred Willard PBS firing controversy. The show then featured Anna Gunn (Skylar White), with Betsy Brandt (Marie Schrader) and Dean Norris (Hank Schrader) joining later.  This segment centered on audience reaction to Skylar's character, her role as both antagonist and voice of reason, and the viewer frustration stemming from their identification with Walter White. The actors discussed their experiences, humorous moments, and the emotional intensity of filming.  Gunn hinted at the intensity of the upcoming final season (she had seen an advance copy).  Brandt and Norris discussed their roles and future projects (Brandt mentioning a role in a Michael J. Fox show and Norris, *Under the Dome*).  Brandt included a comedic bubble wrap bit.  The conversation included profane language, reminiscing about past work, and speculation about future *Breaking Bad* reunions. A segment followed about nostalgic experiences, including the lack of TV guides, taping songs from the radio, using portable TVs with poor reception, Saturday morning cartoons, cassette tapes and CDs for road trips, memorizing phone numbers, limited movie selections, and checking sports scores in newspapers.  This transitioned into a sexually explicit discussion about sexual preferences, clothing, nudity, personal sexual experiences, pornography consumption, maintaining a healthy sex life in relationships, and the challenges of fidelity in careers involving frequent flirtation and sexual advances. The hosts used vulgar language and graphic descriptions throughout.  Another segment began with Opie's story about his son's first shots, leading to a discussion about painful childhood experiences, including vaccinations.  The conversation shifted to maintaining a fresh sex life in long-term relationships, with input from a recently married guest, Sam.  Callers Ed and Cody shared stories of their daughters' breath-holding incidents, leading to a discussion about parenting challenges and changes in childhood, with reflections on the reduction in unsupervised play and resulting injuries.  Several callers and the hosts shared anecdotes about childhood injuries. The conversation returned to vaccinations and concluded with a caller, Steve, recounting a childhood incident involving a BB gun.  The show mentioned "Lance Armstrong fags" and bike shorts before ending with the hosts' usual sign-off.  The broadcast featured frequent use of vulgar and offensive language throughout.

[00:05:00]  um odd uh couple like yeah beating head element of walt and jesse's characters so yeah i couldn't  imagine like what they would have done if you weren't in it because it would have been kind of  one-sided it does give that kind of two guys that are complete opposite ends ends of the spectrum  yeah yeah i mean it's it's this type of show is like you never know uh if you're gonna you're  gonna die or not yeah there's a lot of our you know main cast they'll just they just you know meet 
[00:05:30]  their demise and they yeah when i started when i first started watching it uh and and i was trying  to stay away from spoilers i don't know people will just be and i'm not gonna say any but uh people  people are like there are these holy shit moments where you literally sit there and just go holy shit no  way no fucking way that just happened right or that person got killed or or whatever but  so wait when you got hired you knew you knew you were supposed to die no i had no idea i i oh you

[00:06:30]  of course you recognize tom's a big star on the show on nbc yeah you were on between fucking whisk  commercials in 1997. you depressed me because you look like what i would want to look like  it's true he's me he's me if i was really handsome and thin 
[00:07:00]  he's the perfect norton you're what i could have been  no you couldn't no you couldn't well you know a little booze during pregnancy you might have hurt  no and he can act he knows what to do with his hands  i'm not like jimmy jimmy doesn't know what to do with his eyes don't pop out after every scene  i i i do um what do you do that's the hardest part i always ask real actors when i act i don't like  i'm talking my hands are very still and it's fine but i don't know how to work my hands when i act 
[00:07:30]  it's a fucking nightmare i literally am all over the place you're not to work your mouth  he's a puppet they're all over the place it's uncomfortable  oh maybe hold something that's a good idea but i every scene i'm holding things  where are you going to put a black cock on every set  your mouth  that's amazing  exactly wow now uh uh brian uh cranston's uh your your your co-star um he everybody knows 
[00:08:00]  him from malcolm malcolm in the middle right and uh he played like a pretty goofy guy in that  and you could see pieces of that come through uh in breaking bad it is he more like that uh  on the set brian cranston is a uh child trapped in a man's body yeah that's what it comes across  yeah yeah he's he's incredible his girlfriend's a child trapped in his house  all right rich  call me  that's pretty funny 
[00:08:30]  he pointed at anthony  i don't go for 50 year old women sorry  whoa  no you're not 50  i look beaten down because i've been with him  i wasn't even applying your pencil  bonnie  how old is bonnie  bonnie  come back  you better not walk out  it's just another excuse for me to use meth 
[00:09:00]  that's all  bonnie's in her late 30s  yeah  i i that's absolutely where i put you  in her late 30s  yeah  oh yeah  oh mid  no she looks good i'm telling you  trouble  a lady never tells you know i just  what happened to the interview  i don't know  bonnie jumped on me  we all have this weird stuff going on  we have this weird dynamic  we're happy you're here  i'm attracted to a married woman in the corner  and she's giving her the creeps  i keep looking at her long toes  and i want to touch them  it's thoughtful  we haven't even interviewed

[00:10:00]  because he was just in  a sitcom  for the most part  and kind of playing the goofy dad part  yeah  but man he's good  he's really good  yeah he's great  he gets that whole thing going  of the fear  and confusion  and he played the cancer guy really well too  i was kind of  i was kind of a little skeptical at first watching it  because i'm thinking like  oh god i hate watching shows like this  because i always think i have something  if i watch something where someone's sick in the show  at least they didn't really dwell on it a lot  he was coughing up blood 
[00:10:30]  i wasn't  i felt i was okay  you're in the clear  yeah i was pretty much in the clear  but uh the  i guess the first  and this isn't a spoiler  because it happens  uh the first uh killing  that takes place  that he  is responsible for  um  you know  hands on  and eye to eye  is  is frightening  yeah  because  you really do  kind of get to know that person  um  and uh  i think he did a  a fantastic job on that one  yeah  he's terrifying  how many girls now 
[00:11:00]  are all over you  because you're on this fucking show  i mean  you gotta be  he would have girls all over him  even if he was  at your age  of course  i'm talking about  i'm talking about  young  you know  i think i can speak  on behalf of the youngest  i know  i'm talking about  girls that you let stay over  you know what i mean  right  no i mean  are you from l.a  i am  alright so  how many questions are you going to ask the guy  you ask them two different  let him answer one first  then ask the second one  of course i do

[00:12:30]  you know when you're on tv like that  you can get like clothing  and sheen  can you talk to him like  and fit like  you know what i mean  he's talking about  he's talking about  he's talking about pilfering  from the set  he's trying to get swag  he loves to barter  yeah but the clothes that i wear on the show  are just  they're all like triple xl  like giant  give them the norton when you're done  nothing  i got greedy  it's alright  did you have to hang out and watch some meth heads  to figure out how to  i did  yeah

[00:29:30]  poor fella  yeah  yeah  Don Trump  put out a few kids  right  yeah  exactly  how's it going  you're like a judge  on one of those shows  right  exactly  on The Apprentice  I just got hired  as a judge  on one of the shows  coming out next year  yeah  cool  it's called  America  what  what is that  you're doing  what  are you  is that your talent  isn't that  what are you doing  right now  what is that  you're doing  can you stop  that  it's a long title 
[00:30:00]  they're going to use  an acronym  with a lot of dots  they're going to use  an acronym  dot dot dot  yeah  do you like that  is that fun  yeah  listen  I'm not going  to quit my day job  but it's sort of  an interesting way  to break up the year  it's one of those things  I guess  being kind of  a real estate guy  I'll look back  on 20 years  and be like  hey I was like  network TV  for 7 or 8 years  that is pretty cool  when you think  about your  real estate  it's not  not something I do  it doesn't change  what I  it just makes my life  a lot harder  during the time  that we're filming  because it's hours  that I'm not doing  what I'm supposed 
[00:30:30]  to be doing  so I've got to go back  but it breaks it up  it's pretty cool  that's the beauty  of my career  I don't have that  whole hubbub with TV  to interfere  with the shit  that I'm doing  but watching TV  yeah  that does get  very distracting  that's a lot of fun  you worked with  Bob right  we did it  years ago man  we haven't seen  each other many  we did  me, Bob Rich Voss  and Zamuda  as Tony Clifton  it was this weird  thing  where they were  showing outtakes  why were we doing that  what was the event  it was an Andy Kaufman 
[00:31:00]  special that they  were showing on TV  or there was some  reason why  it wasn't just  it was like the 10 years  or 20 even  of Andy Kaufman  it was at the  House of Blues  in LA  and they showed  a lot of  Jim Carrey footage  that wasn't in the movie  from  it was right  whenever  Man on the Moon  came out  and then they did  a walk by  Kaufman's house  we went over  to the comedy store  it was kind of  a weird show  but cool that way  it was a cool one  and I'm a fan  of Jim  he's a funny 
[00:31:30]  funny guy  that was a weird  that was a weird night  it was a weird crowd  but it's for Andy Kaufman  if so  that's what I expect  it was perfect  perfect for Andy  I'm jealous  I would have loved  to check that out  I was before I  it was my first time  I think meeting Zamuda  and  he's been on the show  as it got hotter  and hotter  the fucking  Clifton makeup  gets tougher  and tougher  to keep on  oh god  nice  and he's doing it again  he's doing Clifton  he is right  hosting a show  at the comedy store 
[00:32:00]  he came in as Clifton  about a year  maybe  it might be two years  was it pleasant  no  it was weird  he's not a pleasant man  it was very strange  extremely strange  very odd  yeah  we enjoyed it  yeah Zamuda's a weird dude  but I mean  he's managed to keep that going  for a long time  and it's odd  we all know  Kaufman is fucking dead  but there is a part of you  that when this son of a bitch  sells it  you're like  well  yeah that could be him  you have like a little hope  yeah  a little hope right  yeah  I love what they did with that 
[00:32:30]  I love that they switched off  who played the character  amazing  yeah  just an amazing thing  it was also the kind of comedy  that  it seems like it would  fit in right now  everyone would understand it  with like  you know  between two ferns  and stuff  the kind of rudeness  and  but back then  that's so nuts  it was nuts  man  and he would do stuff  that just people  didn't like  did you see the  Dinah Shore show  appearance  no  oh it was great  it was just great  was it Coughlin 
[00:33:00]  or  I think it was  I think it was Zmuda  and he was hilarious  yeah  because back then  there was no alternative comedy  right  it wasn't this weird irony  it was like  you were just a guy  who they thought sucked  that was really ballsy  to fucking do that  man  to go up and bomb  on purpose  was that  yeah  catch a rising star  it's not like it was  the luna lounge  where people were  a little bit more tolerant  because they knew  you were exploring  a certain  mentality  or a certain thought process  right  this was just  what the fuck  is he doing  what I would say  is different  is I used to go  do stand up 
[00:33:30]  at the improv  here when I wrote  for Saturday Night Live  because I wanted  to get a laugh  once a week  if you didn't believe  that going to the improv  was not  was the thing  that fed my soul  Jesus  you know how rough  SNL was  what years were you there  87 to 91  okay  I wrote for  you know  Dennis Miller  and Jan Hook's  time  and then also  Farley 
[00:34:00]  and  the Farley years  were  amazing  yeah  yeah  some great stuff  and  on the wall  they had those photos  do you remember  did you ever do that  club  the old  the old improv  yeah the old one  I think I went in there  once  it kind of was  before my time  so anyways  on the wall  were these pictures  of acts  and it was so weird  because there were singers  and there were people  doing juggling  and  and then they explained  to me that that's what  used to happen  in a comedy club  in the 70s 
[00:34:30]  was to have a  a comic  a singer  and a specialty act  in that order  all night long  that's  a variety show  almost  yeah  like Ed Sullivan  people spinning plates  weird variety acts  yeah those spinning plates  in a night club  it was always weird  like I remember  Ed Sullivan  and it was that  kind of  dumb thing  and the whole family  would sit and just be  captivated by  somebody doing  some awful thing  with bouncing balls  and spinning plates  and juggling bowling pins  I was like  I was watching this shit 
[00:35:00]  this is a  a party act  right  this is like a  six year old  birthday party  a birthday party act  and it's on national television  but they were on national TV  yeah  I'm amazed  there are people  interested in taking the time  to learn a practice  like that  my son's pro boy  backstage imagine that  the Beatles talking  to the plate spinning guy  yes  and they're both doing  equally well  they're both  at the same place  in their career  no one remembers that  like when the Beatles  were on Sullivan  like there had to be  some filler acts  before and after  the zookeeper  and there was a guy 
[00:35:30]  that's like  yeah I played with the Beatles  on that Sullivan  no one remembers me  that's a funny moment  in Mr. Saturday Night  which it wasn't  my favorite movie  but there was a really  funny moment  where Buddy  who is Billy Crystal's  you know  nightclub guy  who never quite made it  to the big time  character  comes out  either  was it before  or after the Beatles  and he's just screaming  at all the kids  and he fucking sabotages  his career  but it was a very funny  thing to picture  a comedian  having to come out  and fucking work  with the Beatles  or the Beatles  yeah  I just don't remember  if it was before  or after them 
[00:36:00]  but somebody else did  you were involved  in Mr. Show  right  I helped with it  yeah  I got in the way  of the camera  I  yeah  David and I  did that  David Cross and I  and of course  also Ben Stiller's  show too  that show  I  why didn't that  show take off  because it was  because  it was on  opposite 60 minutes  oh was it  it was such a  crazy placement  for that show  Sunday  at fucking 7  and definitely 
[00:36:30]  for young people  yeah  and it was opposite  60 minutes  I mean it was  death right away  what channel  it was Fox  which was just  beginning  to have shows  so you know  you didn't even know  they had shows  some nights  they did have  like a Fox Sunday  and then like  the rest of the week  it was  the local affiliate  was running  like I Love Lucy  or something  and then they built it  into a 7 day a week  network  but at the time  you're right  it was like Fox Sundays  well maybe they didn't  have a lot of  spaces to choose from  but it really  was not going 
[00:37:00]  to do well  because you know  60 minutes  they already had  you know  all those people  their audience  was people  between 7  and 75  and we had  everyone else  that we could  pluck from  yeah I remember  that just being  really a funny  show  very cutting edge  and comedy  that you weren't  seeing everywhere  it was also  pretty weird  I mean you know  people say  I don't know  when people use  the word weird  for comedy  I think sometimes  it means they're  boring  you know 
[00:37:30]  like Mr. Show  I feel like  people talk about it  like it was weird  or whatever  but I don't think  it's weird at all  I mean it's just  the things we're  making fun of  are pretty apparent  if you're watching it  you can like  oh well that's  a parody of this  and that he's doing  you know  and then  I think  the Ben Stiller show  was like weirder  by far  because  the pieces  were so  such a strange  like mashup  you know  Eddie Munster  in  whatever 
[00:38:00]  what was it  I can't remember  oh  Cape Fear  you know  and like  where does that  come from  you know  medieval cops  I remember that one too  it was cool  some funny stuff  yeah  cool song  that was you  obviously Stiller  Janine Garofalo  Janine  Andy Dick  oh right right  Judd Apatow  was the producer  Rob Cohen  Jeff Kahn  you know  David Cross  wrote for the last  like three episodes 
[00:38:30]  I never talked to him  I just gave him shit  he  he was in the room  pitching  and he was a new writer  right  so he wanted to  get something on  and  people were pitching  these  parodies  that I hated  these stupid  you know  mix the titles  together  and  and  somebody had  a few good  scouts  and I was like  ugh  and David was like  yeah  he was just trying to  cooperate  as a new writer 
[00:39:00]  he was like  I finally got a job  I'm making money  doing comedy  and he's like  well you could do this  and you could do that  and I think  Judd said  well write it up  and I turned to him  and I said  good luck with that  and he remembers that  forever  how hard is it to write  for a show  like I've never written  for anyone but myself  and like SNL  is supposed to be  a fucking rough  environment  like a very tough place  I don't know what it's like now  because I think people  are much nicer now  it seems like  just the vibe there  is much better  than it was  when I was there 
[00:39:30]  and before  I was there  when I first  got there  I couldn't understand  the coldness  and the kind of  strangeness  and intensity  of everyone  I mean I  was already intimidated  because it's my first job  and I'm 25  huge  and then for people  to like pile on  the intimidation  it was like  what is up here  and I found out  that everyone  felt that way  about the place  and previous  cast members  everyone I've spoken to  from SNL  has the same story  about how 
[00:40:00]  just awful  it was to work there  yeah  and they wouldn't  go up there  I mean I heard  that like  Jane Curtin  said she'll never  set foot on this  floor again  in her life  you know  like wow  really  I thought  wasn't this a great  time in her life  it looked fun  Daryl Hammond  was the longest  running cast member  and he's been in  nine mental institutions  that's all you need  to know  does it have  the same cachet  today  as it did  back then  when it was  a rougher  environment  because you know  I kind of look  at it as like  the ultimate  back then  and I know  it's still on 
[00:40:30]  but it doesn't  it does though  it does  and also  like I said  I think it's  different over there  now  I think everyone  is nicer to each  other  there's more  people  which somehow  makes it  there's way  more writers  there was like  14 when I  was there  and now  there's like  23  so just  it  I guess  your odds  went down  to get something  on  but everybody's  kind of in the  same boat  there's so many  people up there  in the same boat  so they're kinder  to each other  it seems  but I think  it does  just because 
[00:41:00]  there's so many  venues for comedy  and it's still  a premiere  place  my question is  more from the  business side  is did like  the aggressive  work environment  actually promote  sort of a better  product  than  the happy  friendly  everyone gets  along nicely  that may be true  that may be true  I don't know  there's so many  Saturday Night Live  alumni  that it's like  and all you guys  seem like  it's like  veterans of the  nom  you all have  this camaraderie  we made it through  it is a really 
[00:41:30]  intense experience  and I  totally  respect to  everyone who  went through there  but the other  thing is I don't  think people are  deluded when they  go there now  like oh I'm  going to be a  movie star  they know  I'm going to  do this  and it might  work  it might  not pan out  I'm just going  to try to  do the best  I can with  this  so when I  was there  people were  still showing  up going  that's it  I'm done  I'm a  billionaire  was that the  Hartman years  or no  yeah  you were there  for Philly  you were  brilliant 
[00:42:00]  funny dudes  man  that was  great  fucking  brilliant  yeah  fantastic  simple caveman  lawyer  was  probably as  crazy as  everyone says  the stories  that come out  crazy  what do you  mean  he's a  really sweet  guy  I understand  that but  there was one  story about how  he would shit  out the window  yeah  he would do  that  why is it  crazy  let's analyze  this  where you should  go  I should explain  I'm a huge  fan of Chris Farley  but  it's crazy 
[00:42:30]  to shit  in your own  window  I guess  at least  it's out  he kept  it interesting  for everyone  I should explain  youthful  he was  very  so depressed  when he  passed  he had a lot  more to give  he sure did  and he was a good  actor too  I did Second City  with him  I did the main  stage with him  and he  did a few  scenes that  weren't  pure comedy  scenes  they were kind  of dramatic  and he could  have done  anything  his movie  work doesn't 
[00:43:00]  show what  he could  have done  and he  just  his performance  at Tommy Boy  was brilliant  way past  just being  funny  it's a real  shame  because my  kids don't  really know  who he is  and I showed  him one or two  movies  but he just  didn't stick  around and do  enough  to make  the impact  he should  have made  but he was  the best guy  ever  I loved him  everybody who  knew him  loved him  and of course  you saw it  coming for so 
[00:43:30]  long  it was  it made  it worse  because  for so many  years  everyone was  trying to  help him  and it  was weird  because there  was one  time  one party  that I  went to  in LA  and I  didn't know  he'd be  there  and he  wasn't  drinking  and he  was with  David Spade  and he  wasn't  drinking  and he  wasn't  he was  totally  on the  ground  and doing  great  and I  thought  oh my  god  he's  going  to make  it  I'd never  seen him  like that  I'd never  seen him  so in 
[00:44:00]  control  of himself  and it  was like  a different  person  than I'd  ever  seen  so  it  made me  really  happy  and to  feel like  he did  it  he made  it there  I can't  believe this  because before  that you  just see  Chris  sober  after  you know  rehab  but very  still  you know  kind of  being a  childish  kind of  being  immature  going  yeah  no  no  I  promise  yeah  I'm  going to  be  good  but you  kind of  go like  you're  just  saying that  to me  like  I'm 
[00:44:30]  your dad  I don't  want to  hear that  I want  to believe  it  you know  and I  did  I believed  it  but  I think  he had  a lot  of  temptation  there's  people who  have a certain  kind of  celebrity  where  when  people see  them on the  street  they're like  dude  let's party  you know  and he  had that  so  the  temptation  around him  was insane  and never  stopped  and just  walking down  the street  you know  and people  are  you know  this is their  one chance  their one chance  to have a beer 
[00:45:00]  with Farley  you know  I'm not going to  pass that up  I know he's  supposed to be  sober  come on  and he's the  big fun guy  come on  Chris  very approachable  it was really sad  how long after  that did he die  that you said  you saw him  at that  I'd say it was  about two years  after that  so it was a while  yeah  there's something  about like  there's something  about like  those big fat  guys who are  like Gleason  John Candy  him  Belushi  those guys  also those  really over the 
[00:45:30]  top  fucking  gut funny  fat dudes  that are great  actors as well  there's a real  they're different  to me than  there's a certain  physicality they have  that like you know  smaller guys don't  have that they bring  like no skinny guy  could do what  Gleason did  there's something  about his  why is that  I don't know  it's just the  dynamics of how  they're made up  and maybe  what goes into  making them  big loud  brash funny guys  but usually  they turn to be  fucking like  Candy was a  really good  serious actor  when he did it  I'm babbling  yeah yeah  I'm babbling  when he did  the Chippendale skit 
[00:46:00]  oh  like I mean  he was actually  a pretty good  athlete man  that stuff was  amazing  he was a dancer  I mean he  didn't do anything  it was incredible  I'm looking at that  I mean he was  as good as  crazy or whatever  it was in there  yeah  with it was like  an extra 300 pounds  it was a classic  but yeah  Breaking Bad  obviously  that's why you're here  what about that show  what is with that show  I've never seen it  everyone's talking about it  I haven't seen it  I hear it's great  I'm a huge  fucking fan  that's great man  thanks 
[00:46:30]  no need to swear  well that's true  I shouldn't use  the blue language  there's no reason  to go blue  satellite radio  yeah you kind of love it  it's like ham  right  yeah it's ham radio  sometimes we get skip  we get skip  and we broadcast  to Europe  yeah Breaking Bad  is awesome  I mean  it really is  and your character  came in  was it the  second season  end of the second season  yeah  end of the second season  yeah he had to  he had to get in enough  trouble where he needed  a lawyer  oh yeah 
[00:47:00]  I guess that's why  you came in  at that point  the character  is great  we were talking  last night  about  your office  alone  is a character  that office  is hilarious  and God  what is it  behind it  and God  we trust  the constitution  behind you  on the wallpaper  the pillars  it's so pompous  well it's such a facade  I mean  everything about it  when they called me  when Vince  called me  to ask me to do it 
[00:47:30]  which is amazing  that he asked me  to do it  you were in mind  when they  like you were the guy  I guess so  wow that's great  somebody turned it down  some idiot  did they ask you  to read for it  or they said  we'd like you to do it  no  I know  isn't that weird  and I  I said so  tell me about it  and he goes  well he's a sleazy lawyer  and I go great  I can do that  how hard can that be  and then he goes  his name is Saul Goodman  and he blah blah blah 
[00:48:00]  and I go  whoa whoa  I said  I'm not  I'm not Jewish  my kids are Jewish  and my wife is  but I'm not  and he goes  oh well he's not Jewish  he just  he's Irish  he made that name up  even better  pure Jewish  to the homeboys  because it is great  Saul Goodman  yeah  and I said  oh that's fantastic  right away  and I right away  wanted to do the hair  the mullet  and the comb over  mixed together 
[00:48:30]  but also cleaned up  as much as possible  on the sides  yeah  and no  no offense  to comb overs  I  family tradition  I've heard that one  on no less than  millions of occasions  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  I'd make fun of it myself  but karma's a bitch  and I figured  my genetic propensity  towards potential bad hair  I'd rather just not go there  you're lucking out  you've got a great head of hair  you really do  I'm doing okay so far  that's why I don't want  to tempt fate  I'll leave it alone  good good 
[00:49:00]  yeah so I  and honestly  you know  Jim I showed up there  I would not have been surprised  if they said  Odenkirk  oh that wasn't the name  no  go back home  wrong actor  no I can't believe it  so years later  two years into it  I asked Vince  you know  Vince Gilligan writes the show  and he's the mastermind  of the show  and there's great writers  amazing writers  but  he is the final say 
[00:49:30]  and I think  propels it into  the place that it is  and  I said  so why'd you hire me  is it  because of the Larry Sanders show  because it's  there's some similarities  between the characters  you know  Saul and  Stevie Grant  the agent I played  and  he goes  no no Mr. Show  so  I don't know  I don't know  I'm not going to touch it  I've done it for three years now  and I love it  great situation man  I'm just going to keep going  was the character supposed to be as prevalent in the show 
[00:50:00]  no  I don't know  you know  because Vince is hard to scrutinize  you know  but he  he said  you know  initially it was three shows  three episodes  wow really  yeah  like Omar from the Wire  was a six  supposed to be on for six  and it just worked  and he became the star of the show  that's kind of  that's great  people love the character  it's  you're so  the character is so sleazy  well it makes wisecracks and stuff  yeah  and because  for him  like all these characters 
[00:50:30]  that you've been watching  if you watch Breaking Bad  everybody's got a gun to their head  yeah  everybody  yep  everybody  the wife of the guy  who's making the meth  is  you know  scared to death  so he's the one character  who wasn't  in fear  all the time  and he was just making wisecracks  yeah  it was a big game to him  like how much money can I make off these  idiot meth cookers  degenerates  and then now  as the  as the  intensity of the show 
[00:51:00]  has gone up  which is amazing  right  that it keeps going up  you can't believe it  it's starting to  the hot water is starting to rise up  yeah  you can't be involved  with that many people  that are in that much trouble  and not get your own  hands dirty  yeah  I'm only on like  beginning of season 3  so don't  don't really  just tell me  to go earmuffs  or something like that  no spoilers  no spoilers  yeah  no  I was lucky enough  to see the first couple of episodes  before it aired  and  that  the first episode was great 
[00:51:30]  the second episode  of the new season here  it was  unbelievable  just blown away by it  I was saying how it's  almost like a  a movie  that's taken years  because  a lot of times  they don't want a character  to change  in a show  yeah  TV shows about  not changing  leave Fonzie the way he is  Fonzie's this guy  but  like  Walter White  has completely changed  through the whole show  yeah  well that was the  the goal of making a show  where that happened  which is  it's probably happened  once or twice before 
[00:52:00]  I don't know  when though  yeah  but yeah  mostly TV is about  watching the same characters  in the same place  it's supposed to be a no-no  to make them change  yeah  you're going to ruin  the formula  but yeah  TV is really changing  with these cable channels  and what they're  trying to do  trying to do something new  and  and so that was  Vince's idea  was to watch  Walter White  mutate  and evolve  or devolve  into this evil guy  and believe every step  and understand  why he makes each step 
[00:52:30]  and it happens  so gradually  that it's not like  one week  he's this timid guy  and then the next week  he was this tough guy  he's always got a loose screw  that's the thing  as you watch it  you start to understand  that he's got this past  that he's got this anger  and rage  oh he's broken  right from the beginning  Jeff Garland said to me  because Jeff  like a lot of people  they  I have people come up to you  when you're on that show  all the time  and go  I never watched it  and then a week  you know  two weeks ago  I watched all of them  I can't believe it 
[00:53:00]  it's like 24 that way  you know what I mean  you sit down  you're like  you're going to have  a marathon  you're like you spent  your whole weekend  watching a show  yeah  and I think it's streaming  on Netflix  so it's easy to watch them all  so Garland comes up to me  and he goes  I finally watched them all  it's about middle age  it's about being  a middle age white guy  yeah well you know  nobody says it  you know  it kind of  you know  if you look at  the character  and how  Walter White's character  and how  much rage 
[00:53:30]  and resentment  he has  you know  I think a lot of  50 year old  white guys  are like  yeah  I never got my  I never got  what's coming to me  he was invisible  he was just a  science teacher  shit on every corner  yeah  always shit on  and what's really great  about your interaction  with him  in the beginning  you were shitting  all over him  I mean  you controlled him  like a puppet  and then  now in the  last few episodes  that I've seen  from this season  boy does he have 
[00:54:00]  you petrified now  too you know  he's the boss  yeah  oh what he's capable  of  yeah  we had him in recently  and Brian described it  as he said  when he came up  with the character  and how to make it  he said he wanted him  to blend in  it was really brilliant  he said like  I gave him  these bland colors  so he blended in  and an impotent mustache  and it's all I can think of  now is an impotent mustache  yeah  greatest term  sitting over  with no purpose  whatsoever  yeah just nonsense  on his face  what a smart actor thing 
[00:54:30]  to do that  he's great  he's a great actor  and a really great guy  and sets the tone  for that set  and then the  the Emmy nominations  came out  and crazy right  yeah  a lot  it's amazing  amazing  I mean  you know  Giancarlo Esposito  is such a great actor  and he's  plays Gus  and he's nominated  and Anna Gunn  is nominated  this year  she's so great  as Skylar  and this year  she's amazing  what's coming up  yeah  so  she looks petrified too 
[00:55:00]  which is great  like  she's in such a spot  that first episode  of this year  I don't want to wreck it  for you  I'll go earmuffs  you know  right at the end  right  I forgive you  yes  that was crazy  and she's like  why  her face is brilliant  because she's  you could hear her  going  what  you forgive me  oh man  everyone's just petrified  it's fantastic  yeah  it's a moment  where you're like  I don't know  if I wanted to see  you didn't need to have  a camera in there  then when they said that 
[00:55:30]  did you  did you need to show us that  and it's also a credit  to the show  that a lot of people  when it first came out  weren't watching it  I mean  this has built up steam  where people are going back  and getting those first  couple of seasons  and blast and throw them  trying to catch up  before the spoilers come out  I can't believe  I get to be on it  it blows me away  and it's an amazing project  I bet  you get recognized  a lot from this  I have more from this  than anything I've done  I've been doing comedy 
[00:56:00]  you know  Stiller's Show  Mr. Show  and all kinds  of little videos  because I'm always  making stuff  with friends  in LA  Funny or Die  Funny or Die stuff  and you know  but I've done so much  but this is obviously  the biggest thing  by far  in a way  that I can  yeah  do you have any  clue of where  the storyline's going to go  I'm not even going to  ask you what happens  but I'm just curious  if you know  I won't make it  outside the studio  that's true 
[00:56:30]  we might have to  beat it out of you  you know  it is a darker season  this season  as you can see  and  but there's some  amazing  mind-blowing  stuff that happens  that when I read it  you know  you read the scripts  when I get the scripts  you read it  it's just like watching it  you're like  what?  no!  no!  you're kidding me!  I mean I call them up  and say  how are you going to do that?  you know  that's got to be fun  it is fun  and then you want to  forget it right away 
[00:57:00]  because you want to  watch it again  and sort of see it  for the first time  do you get the whole  you get the whole script  you don't just get  your signs?  the last couple episodes  of the season  they black it out  like a government document  CIA document  yeah they do  because  script almost got out  like two years ago  I don't know how  but  really?  so they don't want to  they don't trust you guys  at all  ruin it for everyone  yeah  yeah  I kind of  I don't want to know  what's going to happen  especially now that  the end of the  the run is 
[00:57:30]  is kind of  looming  I watch these episodes  like you want to  savor them  they end and you're like  shit there's another one  gone  yeah  I definitely  I mean I watch it  mostly on like an iPad  when I travel  I save them all up  and so it's like  man there's two more  shows in the season  it's like do I watch it  now and try to grab it  all in or do I like  wait two weeks  and just try to  get something more out of it  watch something else  to break it up  I totally get people  who go I can't  I have to wait  till the end of the season  and watch them all  I can't  I can't suffer  through the week  I watch them 
[00:58:00]  when I ever watch  anything I watch it fast  because again  spoilers and the amount  on Twitter  oh these pricks  yeah they'll ruin  anything on Twitter  yeah so you gotta  get it out quick  whenever I'm  whenever I'm doing  something like that  having one of these  marathons of a show  that I haven't  caught up on  I never say on the air  that I'm watching it  don't tell me what  happens on Big Ange  oh damn  don't spoil  Big Ange  I'll get right now  I'm on season two  of Laverne and Shirley  and I want to know  what happens  yeah she blows 
[00:58:30]  the big ragu  yeah I hear there's  a double dildo coming  where the father  catches him in the  pizzeria  but I don't want to  I've been watching  classic sports network  don't tell me what  happens  in Super Bowl 17  hey you had a  stand up background  right  I did stand up  I'm not a real  like you're a real  stand up  I'm not a real  stand up  I just use the  stage for getting  up there and  telling jokes  but you did  stand up  no but he does 
[00:59:00]  it for a living  I'm not real  I just build  buildings  Jim fights with  an audience  see I don't do  that  if they don't  like me I go  well okay I gotta  go  it's okay you  don't have to  like me  I probably  don't like you  believe me if I  was a better  actor I wouldn't  fight with him  either  it's just I  have no choice  it's either that  or I'm fucking  not working at  all  you gotta go  with what you  got  yeah  love to be a  better actor  that's part of  it you know  is being a  real great  stand up  like you  is that you  get up in  front of people 
[00:59:30]  and you  work it  for that crowd  you make it  work for you  but you know  it's hard  it's a tough  gig  so you know  I just do it  for fun  yeah  but I did it  I did it  during the comedy  boom  when I was  starting out  because I always  loved sketch comedy  that's always  what I wanted  to do  and but  you could  if you could  write some jokes  you could  get up there  and make some  money  remember how  crazy that was  I mean I  don't know  Jim you came  kind of  1990 I started  and I got my  first paid gig  like April  of 91 
[01:00:00]  I missed  I was on the  tail end of the  boom  when it was  kind of  bottlenecking  a little bit  would you bamboozle  for that  paying gig  I was  Dennis Ross  and Jim Florentine  oh okay  you know my  first paid gig  yeah  wow damn  yeah 91  because I do  remember when  I mean there  were on any  Friday and Saturday  night  it's crazy  there were so  many comedy shows  on television  just they couldn't  find enough clubs  to pop a camera  on in front of  that brick wall  and just  it was  comic after comic  in Chicago 
[01:00:30]  it was like  it was like  there were two  clubs and then  two years later  there were  like 12  like you know  these chains  they would open  chains of them  like Zaney's  had like three  locations  one of those  is close too  Zaney's in  Vernon Hills  two of them  yeah  and quantity  did not mean  quality  no no  it didn't  wow  and every disco  had a  like used to be  disco  had a comedy night  but yeah  you could pick up 
[01:01:00]  50 bucks  and it was better  than waiting  tables  that hurt a lot  of comics too  like a lot of  guys who might  have been much  funnier  start headlining  before they were  ready  because there  were so many  headliner spots  available  and then in  1993  94  95  they just  they weren't  good at writing  materials  they were doing  the same shit  a lot of those  guys had been  phased out  and probably  would have been  better acts  if they had  been forced  to  fucking  work their  way through  it  trying to  fill up  so many  comedy clubs  it was so  crazy  it was nuts  back then  you can't do  it like  you can't  it's not like 
[01:01:30]  opening a disco  where you just  play the top  songs and everyone  can play them  you need to get  these guys to show  up and  have material  entertain a crowd  so it was really  some lame  lame comedy  I find sketch  to be harder  because like  I've watched  I've never seen  Second City Live  excuse me  but I've gone to  UCB  and when Amy  Poehler went  and what a  masterful  improver she is  she's fucking  brilliant at it  and it's like  improv is either  really really  horrendous  or it's fucking  art  well you know 
[01:02:00]  if you're gonna  do it good  the people who  do it well  they do it  all the time  you know  they get  their head  into this space  I've seen some  great improvisation  I'm not a great  improviser  I've done it  but I've seen  some great stuff  and UCB guys  are the top  notch  people  some of the  people who do  like ASCAT  and stuff  you know  like Besser  and Amy Poehler  and Matt Walsh  but then you're  right  a lot of  improv is terrible  but Sketch 
[01:02:30]  to me  he was writing  sketches  and then putting  them up  and  yeah  I love that  Monty Python  and early  Saturday Night Live  and Second City TV  those were the things  oh you guys  I'm sorry  were you guys  more improv  or sketch  were you guys  were you doing  improv too  I did improv  because that's  where you do it  in the same place  where you would  do a sketch show  but I was always  more for let's go  write this  and try to make  it good  and improvisation  to me was a way  to get there  but I always  was skeptical  of improv  and still am  a little 
[01:03:00]  when they're  really good at it  when people do it  two times a week  for three years  or more  some people do  they get to this place  where their head  is just  they're making connections  the Groundlings  is amazing too  in LA  the alumni Groundlings  the guys  have been just  doing it for years  and that can be  that can be  mind-blowing  because everything  ties up  and it's funny  and how did you do that  it's hard  to grasp 
[01:03:30]  but a lot  of improv  is just people  being clever  on stage  and being scared  and everyone  laughs because  they're all  worried for you  it's just weird  so we'll get together  and we'll worry  and if anybody  says anything  remotely clever  we'll all be  thrilled  laughing at the  cleverness  instead of  maybe sometimes  it would deserve  like a nod  but it gets a laugh  I still find it scary  because I just know 
[01:04:00]  I would find crutches  and just lean on them  constantly  it's very difficult  to do  well  stand-up  is a scary  thing  yeah  chip's a great example  stand-up seems  petrifying to me  stand-up is a scary  thing because of  the audience though  I mean  you get some  really rough  audiences in stand-up  you can attack them  you can't attack  the camera guy  or the fucking  writers  when you're bombing  in a scene  it's horrible  because you're stuck  in it  I just gotta keep 
[01:04:30]  forcing out my dialogue  stand-up you can go  wherever you want to go  and like you can own it  I can say I stink  this crowd blows  I'm terrible  you can acknowledge it  it's much more  yeah  yeah it's much easier  to me than  acting is fucking hard  man  yeah it looks it  yeah you're stuck  in a scene  you can't get out of it  how did you feel  when you got this part  is this like your first  really dramatic  even though there's  a comedic element to it  is this really your first  kind of dramatic role  yeah I guess so  yeah  did you have any 
[01:05:00]  reservations about it  no no no  oh you know  the only thing about it  is you know  in comedy  comedy is back and forth  you say two lines  and the other person  says two lines  and this  my character  is kind of a  motor mouth  and he runs  off  and so I have  these long monologues  and I  I wasn't going to  memorize it  because I was used  to comedy scripts  and you get the  blue pages  which is the rewrite  like three days  before you go  shoot it  right  and anything long 
[01:05:30]  in comedy  gets cut down  to two lines  right  yeah I can't help  you today  here's the door  and  so I didn't  memorize it  because I was like  well they're going  to shorten this  all I'm  I mean  essentially  what my character  is saying here  is I can help you  so I'll just  say that  verbatim right  yeah they changed  like a date  they changed like  the word  Tuesday to Wednesday  and that was it  and everything else  you've memorized  so that was kind of 
[01:06:00]  strange  it's such long things  but long passages  but then as I studied them  I started to really  get the characters  like how he  how his mind works  and so there was  something going on  in there  and yeah  it's new  it's a challenge  for me  and I  am really enjoying it  and yes  it's so different  it comes off  it comes off  very well  I mean  I can't  I couldn't imagine  anybody else  doing that part  you've really owned it  as an actor  definitely 
[01:06:30]  well thanks  I'm lucky  is there anything  hard for you  I always ask this  to guys who  are good actors  like what's hard  for you to play  like is there  like one that's  like that like  that emotion is hard  or that type of a scene  is difficult  I don't think  I could cry  some actors can cry  it's nuts  I did a movie  called Melvin Goes  to Dinner  and it's  Annabelle Gerwitch  is in it  and she had a scene  where she cries  and she just cries 
[01:07:00]  yeah  and every time  every time you do it  tears come  how do you do that  flowing out of her eyes  a lot of actors  can't put the tears out  like you'll see them  like they do the crying face  they just do that  they just wince  your face is dry  she just cried  like what is that  how do you do that  she's like  oh it's acting  no I think  there's something  screwy in my head  that's funny  there's something  that you're always  on the brink of crying  you're constantly  on the brink of crying 
[01:07:30]  if she thinks  her boyfriend's  not listening  during a discussion  that fucking  starts crying  yeah  she's always  got to hold it back  I don't think  I could do that  but otherwise  I think it's a woman thing  I think they have  the ability to do that  much easier than men  yeah perhaps  I've seen guy crying  in movies  and TV shows  it's pretty amazing  Debbie Moore  has a great teardrop  Denzel  won him the Oscar  in Glory  it's like you know  he's just standing  getting whipped  and the fucking tear  just drops  I think the single tear  the single tear 
[01:08:00]  on the not crying face  is more  has more impact  than the goofy cry face  yeah  like Debbie Moore  just stood there  and one tear  in Ghost  just fell out  of her eyeball  you're like  holy shit  that's fucking amazing  yeah  well sometimes  you do that  with mentholatum  yeah  they put the fan  with the menthol  in your face  they blow  in your eye  through one of those  menthol inhalers  you know  oh shit  and then just before  they say action  or they say action  and somebody blows 
[01:08:30]  through that  into your eye  for like  ten seconds  burns  and then gets out  of the frame  and then tears  come out  but that's different  I could do that  yeah  I could react  to an injury  that's what you're doing  yeah  I'm injured here  this is painful  yeah I don't know  but I really think  that one Denzel Washington  oh he did it in X too  when he met  Elijah Muhammad  he fucking dropped  a tear  a couple of tears 
[01:09:00]  and it was  it's really intense  because like  there was no blubbering  lead up to it  it was a deadpan face  and then  there was no indication  amazing  believe me  that's how I would ruin it  I would go  get me a tissue  like I would really  fucking let the audience  know it was coming  cut  cut  you're not supposed  to say tears coming  and look at the front camera  it's Jim Cut Norton  yeah 50 take idiot  I tend  are you better on  I tend to do better  as the takes go on  like  like Louie's fun to shoot with 
[01:09:30]  because he works  like a comic  but some guys  are better in the first  what do you mean  he works like a comic  does he  he's okay with  fucking around a little bit  like a stand up  because he's in charge  so whatever  like he'll go  alright let's just do it  and then like  we'll play with a line  a little bit  or I'll add something  or he'll add something  he's fine doing that  as a stand up  right  no I don't change anything  by the way  people  because I've done  so much comedy  and because Saul Goodman  is funny  they say  so do you improvise  a lot of that  I don't improvise 
[01:10:00]  anything  it's all written  not a single word  no  that's even more impressive  don't stray  I really learn it  verbatim  yeah  and do it verbatim  well the writing  is so good on that show  you know  it's kind of fun  to do that too  because  that's where you really go  so how do I get  from this thought  to this thought  and it's like  it's neat  to do something new  I mean I'm  50 this year  and you know  people don't often  let you do something  very different  from what you've done  yeah  when you get older 
[01:10:30]  so it's cool  to have this opportunity  I'm enjoying it  yeah  it's also  you know  obviously it's being written  but you have to  deliver the lines  and you can't just do it  deadpan straight face  you know  there's inflections  and facial expressions  and body movements  and it's  yeah  you do play  a great sleazy lawyer  I just  I just dig through it  and ask my  you know  kind of follow  his train of thought  and ask myself  what he's thinking about  and one thing  I also do is 
[01:11:00]  you know  Robert Evans  the famous film producer  yeah  the kid stays in the picture  great book  and the best  book on tape  ever  book on tape  really  never experience  a book on tape  oh it's so awesome  because he's got  this incredible  you know Robert Evans  right  yeah  yeah I know  and he's got this  he's got this  crazy  like  up and down  to his voice  and  he's always saying  did I do the right thing 
[01:11:30]  no  would I do it again  in a heartbeat  it's like a sing song thing  and it  the pacing changes up  and  he's just really fun  to listen to  so I always do  all my lines  as him  a couple times  before I go out there  oh wow  just because  he's able to do  like a monologue  and you want to hear  the whole thing  and he puts like  do I think that's  a smart move  not in a billion years  you know 
[01:12:00]  it's just this  crazy  rhythm-y thing  and  I think it maybe  helps me to  be more entertaining  in those  those long  I've heard  they tell us  we have to wrap up  I guess  I'll give you  the press  we got  no we got a special  we're running  oh we do  yeah you're  you're a comical  when does that start  right now  really to be honest  with you  do you know  Fred Willard  I do know  do you like him  more now  today than you  did yesterday  I know I do 
[01:12:30]  I saw Fred  only a few weeks  ago we did  a Garland's movie  Jeff Garland's movie  a few weeks ago  and he was so  funny  he's fucking  hilarious man  he's really funny  and he didn't  jerk off once  not once  that you're aware  of  now look  I gotta ask you  something  first of all  I don't go  into porn theaters  and this is a  old people need  to learn how to  use the internet  the first half  of our discussion  we gotta buy him  a modem  shouldn't you be 
[01:13:00]  arresting people  who are in porn  theaters not jerking  what are they doing  exactly  those are the creeps  why are you in there  not jerking off  playing words with  friends  that is a little  bit creepy  I don't know  what he was doing  I don't care  I don't want to know  I can't believe  people are talking  about this  in this day and age  he's hilarious  and PBS fired him  those shitheads  even if he was  jacking off  he's not  he's not  he's doing it  in the right place 
[01:13:30]  it's a good citizen  that's what you  should do  in the right place  he's home in front  of your computer  by the way  selling weird  old combinations  of old TV shows  so weird  PBS  and they get this  brilliantly funny dude  this relevant like  guy who's been in  so many great things  and they shit can him  because he behaves  like an adult  in an adult establishment  if it happened  even  he's saying  it didn't happen  I'm hoping for his sake  it actually didn't  just because I'm sure  he's embarrassed  well I don't care  either way  I don't want to hear  any more about it 
[01:14:00]  it's just so  you know what I mean  it just shouldn't be  reported  it shouldn't happen  leave people alone  if they want to go in there  I don't care  yeah I'm sure  you know  back in the old days  well it's you know  the new 24 hour news cycles  I'm sure Clark Gable  maybe at some point  wanted to spank one out  in a movie theater  and they left him alone  oh my god  news today is a little  different man  there's so much stuff  that's irrelevant  to real news  you gotta fill it up  I remember one time  jerking off in a porn theater  on my way home  from a gig  I was  this was way back 
[01:14:30]  when they existed  on Route 130  and you'd always have to  sit in a corner  away from everybody  because guys sit together  when they want to  fuck around  but I would always  be off to myself  and I remember  just a fucking  you could kind of  see in the upper corner  a bunch of guys  were lining up  in front of some dude  who was blowing everybody  and I had to leave  that was the first time  I was where poppers  were used  I saw the guys breathing  and I'm like  I gotta  this is too fucking  even for me  it was too creepy  too David Lynch  because I didn't want  to be watched  jerking off  I believe

[01:19:30]  when is it premiere  because I don't  I already  premiere Sunday  at 10pm  on AMC  and we love AMC  very excited  and we love  Dish Network  we love them all  now last time  we don't love Dish  they cut us out  that's right  see I'm with  Brian Creston  someone has to  take his side  you know  without getting  too far into it  and I really don't know  there is a  huge settlement  that was  that came down  a little while ago 
[01:20:00]  against Dish  and for our  parent company  at AMC  and so it feels  a little punitive  that they're  trying to punish  AMC Network  so they're just  cutting them all off  cutting them off  yeah  oh wow  so Walking Dead  Mad Men  all that is all  isn't that bad  for Dish  no one wants to  see those shows  that's not true  they don't really  want to see those  but they're a sponsor  it's got to play  the side of the sponsor  I just do the  library  and we're desperate  sir 
[01:20:30]  are you  not really  now last time  you were in  you were talking  about Walt  and how  you were getting  really really  over the deep end  and  very very bad  and I'm seeing  this happen  yeah  with the first  two episodes  I saw  no spoilers  don't worry people  you don't have to  change the channel  here  I'm not going to  say anything  but you are  taking this  to a very  extreme level  and it doesn't  look like it's 
[01:21:00]  going to end  well  I'll just say  that  well it is  called Breaking  Bad  yeah  yeah  not breaking  good  no  not breaking  good  I mean it is  it is  going dark  you know from  the beginning  we knew that  it was going to  go this way  because he  our creator  Vince Gilligan  and the Lord  Jesus Christ  said that  he wanted to  take a guy  who was  a really  nice guy  a good guy  and take him  from Mr. Chips  to Scarface  so we knew  the trajectory  I just didn't 
[01:21:30]  know how deep  and dark  it would actually  go for this guy  yeah just  a complete  disregard  for anyone  else  but you  and apparently  your immediate  family  but even  even your wife  on the show  is starting to  look at you  like this is  a monster  yeah  and and  and she  doesn't  even know  the half  of it  I know  she doesn't  it's  it gets  really bad  she doesn't  need to know  I was going  to tell her  you're going  to tell her 
[01:22:00]  I'm not  saying a word  you go  about your  business  Mr. Science  Teacher  the thing  that's so  interesting  about this  is that  I think  certainly men  but any  human being  is capable  of getting  this dark  given the  right set  of circumstances  I'm telling  you  I think  it's possible  what's happened  to Walter White  is that  he's been  seduced  never before  in his adult  life has he  had money  has he been  able to  intimidate  any other  man ever  just a mild  mannered  science teacher  he was  invisible  to everybody 
[01:22:30]  even himself  and all of a  sudden  through these  set of  circumstances  he finds  himself  he finds  his power  and yeah  he's preening  now  he's a  he's a  peacock  but he  but it's  it's better  than feeling  numb  you know  so if  you  if you  told him  you  you  could  have  an  extraordinary  two  years  to live  or the  absolute  most boring  20 years  to live  what would  you do  and I'm  like  I'm  not so  sure  there's a  lot of  desperation  and depression  involved in 
[01:23:00]  you know  that kind of  that kind of  desperate life  yeah  the uh  the transformation  has been  done so well  that it's  believable  uh  that's  that's the  amazing part  over the course  of all the  seasons  you have  gone from  just the  invisible  science teacher  to a  drug  kingpin  for the  most part  and uh  the whole  transformation  has been  very  realistic  because it's  it  it didn't  there wasn't  any one  moment  that kind of  made it  happen  it's just  all these 
[01:23:30]  things came  together  uh  over time  I think  I think  that's what  Breaking Bad  does well  is that  he uses  the medium  the way  it should  it's like  your show  use the medium  the way  look at us  see  you do  you use  the medium  the way  it should  it's  immediate  it's  it's  current  it's  funny  it moves  quickly  yeah  um  Breaking Bad  would not  make a good  movie  because there  are too  many elements  that would  have been  necessary  to cut  out  in order  to make  it an  hour and 
[01:24:00]  a half  to two  hours  and you'd  look at  it and  say  how did  this guy  become  this  he was  just  it's  too  truncated  there's  too many  leaps  so  serialized  television  slowly  played out  agonizingly  played out  sometimes  you wanted  this way  you definitely  saw the direction  you wanted to go in  but it took these  things  these hurdles  you had to go over  and awful things  you had to do  to learn how to be  that evil  it's an amazing  transformation  yeah  it's 
[01:24:30]  very cool  really a sociological  experiment to me  can I  I don't want to give  any spoilers or anything  I gotta ask you  at the beginning  very beginning  of the first episode  of season 5  we do see a different  look on you  a different look  when you're near the  trunk  yes you do  was that a flash  you're being so good  by the way  I'm trying  was that a flash  forward  it is a flash  forward  okay  you're looking at a  flash forward  so we get a little  resolution of that  well no  you know what's funny  is that the teaser 
[01:25:00]  the teaser of the  first episode  is  is revealing  in so many ways  yes  and yet  not  and you don't  get anything  you don't get  it's like  what what what  and then you realize  I don't  what did I just see  that's what I was  doing  I was literally  craning my neck  looking up  going what's in there  what is  like thinking I'd  see something  different if I  looked the other  way  yeah  just it's  it's been such  a compelling show  the suspense  is great  the second episode 
[01:25:30]  of this season  was  edgy or seat  the entire time  is edge  of your seat  Mike  the character  Mike in there  the fact  what he wants  to do  and what he  has to do  the difference  in that  is  you start  feeling bad  for him  and he's a  son of a  bitch  it's amazing  how this show  toys with your  sympathies  where you have  these people  doing awful  things  and yet  you're  sympathizing  and almost  rooting for  them  come on 
[01:26:00]  make that  crystal meth  yeah  come on  bring back  the old  team  let's get  the band  back together  kind of a  feel to it  it really is  housewives  saying  oh maybe  we just  warn him  with a  you know  shooting his  kneecap  as opposed  to killing  him  you know  I don't  think we  have to  kill  everyone  that  that just  goes to  show how  well the  writing is  because  you do  how do  you get  somebody  that's so  awful  of a  person  and  make him  sympathetic 
[01:26:30]  what was  so interesting  about Vince  Gilligan's  jump into  this  is that  historically  television has  always been  about staying  the same  every single  character that  you know  and love  in the past  you could  turn on the  television  there he is  there's my  guy  my pal  he's always  the same  I can depend  on him  and this show  has always  been about  change  how can we  change  and just when  he comes to  a certain point  change him  again  get him darker  get him moving  and then what  about my 
[01:27:00]  wife who  is oh  she's a  loving  caring  oh wait a  minute  maybe she's  changing too  everybody's  changing  yeah she's  got a little  bit of evil  in her too  but I  think it's  almost like  she didn't  realize how  bad this  was going  to get  and how  far you  drag your  family into  all this  and what  is  initially I  guess the  motivation was  dying of  cancer  have to  take care 
[01:27:30]  of the  family  so it  was a  noble  effort  when you  started  but how  did it  get so  evil  what is  it in  the  character  is it  the fact  that the  character  just didn't  want to be  bored for  the rest  of his  life  well if  you know  it's been a  hypothetical  we've all  played  if you had  a year to  live how  would you  live your  life  and this  poor  bastard  is  thinking  I'm  just  going to  wither  away  and my  wife's  going to  empty my  bedpan  and we'll  blow through  whatever little  savings we  have  and that's  the legacy  I'm leaving 
[01:28:00]  no man  wants to  you want to  have some  control  so for the  first time  in his life  he makes  a bold  move  and says  by God  I'm going  to do  this thing  because I  know how  the one  thing I  don't know  is what  to do  with it  I don't  know how  to sell  it  so that's  why he  needs  Aaron Paul's  character  Jesse  in order  to come  in to  distribute  the thing  simple  plan  make a  bunch  of money  give it  to my  family  die  there it  is  he realizes  once you  sell your  morality 
[01:28:30]  for cash  you're lost  there's no  line  when you try  to become  someone you're  not  you're lost  so you paint  a real picture  of this guy  as an actor  how much of  that do you  do beforehand  how much of  it do you  do just  from the  script  will you  go home  and think  who is  this person  how do you  see it  when you  play somebody  like this  not anymore  when you  first start  to put  a character  together  you ask  that question  a lot  where is  he from  in fact  most actors  including myself  will do  what's  called  a backstory 
[01:29:00]  you'll  write your  own  backstory  his  education  where he  was raised  teachers  things like  that  that just  helps fill  in the  blanks  for you  and some  of it  may come  to fruition  some of  it may  never be  known  except to  you  but you  start doing  that so  you have  more anchor  points  the more  that an  actor knows  about a  character  it gets  inside of  him  or her  and you  feel more  comfortable  in how  you portray  it  after a  certain point  I don't  have to  think about 
[01:29:30]  it  I just  live it  I slip  into his  wallabies  put on the  glasses  and the  chinos  and I go  there you are  how much  different  of a  guy  is he  from  you  I mean  not the  behavior  but I  mean  as a  guy  he's  killed  more  people  than  I  I've  killed  people  paint the  wrong  picture  I don't  mean  his  actions  I mean  as a  person  this is a  regular  person  pushed  into  extraordinary  circumstances  so that's  what you're  based on  being a  real  person  he's  not  anything  like  me  no 
[01:30:00]  no  no  he's  very  very  smart  so  there's  the  big  comparison  there  he's  been put  in a  position  where  he  has  not  expressed  himself  as a  man  as an  adult  he's  never  taken  chances  my  whole  career  being an  actor  and being  in the  arts  you're  taking  chances  constantly  and you  have to  get  comfortable  with  that  he's  introverted  or at  the start  he was  shy  he was  milquetoast 
[01:30:30]  so  I had  to get  into  that  mindset  of  what  makes  him  be  him  what  makes  a  person  what  makes  a  man  cave  in  like  that  and  become  depressed  and I  came up  that he  developed a  fear of  failure  and that  he had  missed  opportunities  in his  life  and that  led to  his  depression  and that  led to  this  kind of  invisible  man  concept  that I  wanted to  bring  forward  and so  when we  were  designing  the face  and the  hair  I took  all the  color 
[01:31:00]  out of  my  hair  when we  first  started  I had  this  little  impotent  mustache  a mustache  that you  can see  through  and was  light  because we  lightened  it  and thinned  it out  and you  never  if you  want to  look  make an  impotent  mustache  you guys  I know  you'd want  this  you never  have the  hair  turn down  the corners  of the mouth  because then it  gets macho  when you get  down there  so I used  to cut it  here  I thin  it out  I wanted  a mustache  for people 
[01:31:30]  to look at  and go  what's  what's  the point  what are you  trying to  say  wow  so you  groomed  that  it's like  what do  you  impotent  mustache  I wanted  him to  disappear  so all  his clothes  were  topes  and  sand  color  and  off  whites  and  things  I wanted  him to  blend  into the  walls  I wanted  him to  feel  invisible  and so  on those 
[01:32:00]  first episodes  when I'm in  the classroom  and trying  to look  at anybody  who might  be interested  in chemistry  and getting  nothing  it helped  me as a  character  realize  I'm so  depressed  how did I  get here  I'm looking  at it  nobody cares  that I'm  even here  nobody knows  I'm even  here  if I walked  out of this  classroom  they wouldn't  even know  they're going  to continue  texting  and whatever  I've lost  and that  was part  of what  made you 
[01:32:30]  do what  you ended  up doing  on the  show  I guess  if you  were successful  or if the  character was  a successful  teacher  that was  beloved  by the  students  even  if you  got the  cancer  and needed  to get  money  for the  family  it probably  wouldn't have  worked out  the same  way  it was  just a  combination  of everything  it had  everything  to do  with that  all the features  were there  one thing  confusing  though  you did  it  initially  for your  family  and out  of love  for your  family  and concern 
[01:33:00]  about their  future  and then it  seems like  you lost  the concern  for your  family  because you  pretty much  put them  in danger  now  with what  you're doing  how did  that  change  not at all  I think  it's great  all for one  all for me  wait a minute  but what  happened  with the  character  that he  kind of  not wrote  off his  family  but didn't  seem that  concerned  Walter White  was seduced  he was seduced  by power  by money  all the things 
[01:33:30]  even at the  cost of his  family  well he didn't  realize  I mean  we've all met  very bright  people  who in a  social situation  you go  oh my god  this guy's  a PhD  and he's  like unbelievably  bright  and yet  he can't  hold a  conversation  in a social  environment  so it  doesn't  mean  if you're  good at  one thing  you're good  at another  and so  here you  have a  man who  is very  smart  but he  made some  poor choices 
[01:34:00]  and he  actually thinks  that this  simple plan  will work  but he  doesn't have  the skill  set to be  a mastermind  criminal  at least  back then  he didn't  he's learning  quickly  is there  anything  hard for you  as an actor  is there  anything  that's hard  for you  to play  like when  they ask  you to do  one  is there  a behavior  or an emotion  that's easier  for you  or more  comfortable  for you  and then  there's one  that when you  do it  you're like  alright this  one's more  work  any given  emotion  I don't know  yeah if you're 
[01:34:30]  asked to  play some  fast talking  kind of  guy who is  authority on  something you  have a lot of  research to do  because you have  to really delve  into that  and know what  you're talking  about because  it's coming  out of your  mouth so  much faster  than you ever  thought  my guy on  drive that movie  drive was kind  of that way  where he  he talked too  much he spoke  too much  so I had to  just get back  into the garage  and you know  just get my  head into that  you know that 
[01:35:00]  grease monkey  kind of mentality  and and pick up  a wrench and  figure out things  and you know  because I  and you know  I ad-libbed a lot  in that film  and it was a lot  about cars and  things like that  do you give  yourself something  to do like a  lot of a lot  of great actors  will do that  like they'll  always be doing  something like  normal like  whether it's  you know eating  or just doing  something like  you know Pacino  with his hands  the people like  there's these  little weird  things that  actors do that  I think is so  interesting just  to feel like  it's real life 
[01:35:30]  it gives it  gives actors a  handle something  to hold on to  if you're just  standing there  it it doesn't  always feel the  most comfortable  so if you're  actually doing  something and  you know peeling  a potato or  something  anything  it basically  makes the actor  a little  distracted in  an activity  which is a  good thing  see I never  know  it's a running  joke on this  show  but I don't  when I'm just  standing there  like if they  said in every  scene  like we need to  just dump salt  on something 
[01:36:00]  like if there  was slugs in  every scene  I'd be fucking  amazing  but when you  just have to  stand there  like walk  into a room  and make a  proclamation  I stiffen up  and I literally  don't  I watch hands  so much  when people  act because  it's so hard  to be natural  and conversational  like right now  my hands are  just dead  you don't think  about it when  you're talking  to someone on  the street  your hands  are doing  what they do  but if you  were told  to speak  to a person  on camera  now you're  conscious of  everything  like we were  holding this  conversation  if I had  written this  conversation out  and we were  having it  you'd be 
[01:36:30]  sitting there  as natural  as you are  and my hands  I'd be like  I'd be  raising them  I'd be  fucking  poking things  and then  they'll tell  you  no  you're  you're  moving  your  hands  let's do  another take  everybody  and just  keep your  hands  to your  side  now you're  thinking  get my  hands  to my  side  I've been  moving  my  hands  Jim  this is  whose life  is it  anyway  you can't  be moving  your hands  around a lot  remember Jim  you're paralyzed  from the neck  down  so the movement  thing is a little 
[01:37:00]  bit of a problem  I'm always  interested in  how guys  do that  maybe you're  just so good  you don't  think about it  anymore  I'm fascinated  by how you  can make that  so fucking  natural  it's so hard  to do  man  it does  look  hard  well it's  supposed to  look hard  and look  easy  but it is  actually very  difficult  to do  are you  comfortable  around guns  you do a lot  of gunplay  in the show  well my character  is not  he doesn't  know from  that world  so no  he's not  too comfortable  when I was a 
[01:37:30]  kid I used  to shoot  rifles  and doing  some competitive  shooting  and that was  fun I enjoyed  that  so I know  my way around  it  I guess you're  more apt to  poison somebody  or something  a little more  science  sorry  wait a minute  did he touch  my coffee  I love the idea  of incorporating  science in  killing people  there's more  of that  coming up  I don't  doubt it  it does 
[01:38:00]  work well  and your  loyalty to  Jesse  it seems  like it's  there in the  criminal element  of what you  want to do  but as a  person or  friend you  have really  no respect  or like  for this guy  well  you know I  don't know  and I think  he idolizes you  he still calls  you Mr.  White  which is  very odd  to watch  I think it's  more a sign  of him  kind of 
[01:38:30]  still being  a child  in the  classroom  and calling  you Mr.  White  but yeah  you personally  on a personal  level you've  done horrible  things to this  guy  well I don't  know  I mean if  he ever finds  out what I've  done  yes there  will be  hell to pay  we'd be in  trouble yeah  but he's a  great great  actor and he's  fun to work  he's supposed  to be here  yeah I was  going to say  great actor  not very  he's not very  punctual  he doesn't  own a watch  he has no  clue what 
[01:39:00]  time it is  at any given  moment  he's stuck  in traffic  yeah but  yeah it just  does seem like  you've you put  everything aside  even that and  and that's a  very threatening  place to put  yourself because  you know he  would do awful  things if he  found out what  you've done  yeah and you  know as we  wind down for  season this  season five  season six  we'll start for  eight episodes  and then we're  done  see I did  not know  that  yes yeah  and that's  going to be  okay and  that'll be  it  wow I need  more are you  okay with  that I'm  okay with 
[01:39:30]  that yeah I  mean it will  have it it's  time yeah I  mean given our  the conceit of  the story that  this man had  two years to  live and he's  still going to  die of lung  cancer if if  not of something  else beforehand  but yeah I  want to stay  true to what we  told the audience  and beyond and be  fair with that  and uh you  don't want to  do like mash  for the korean  wars 11 years  11 years  I thought this  was supposed to  only be three  years the  beetles are  playing in the  korean wars  really was it 
[01:40:00]  11 years yeah  I guess it  was yeah it's  time it's time  to move on it's  time to move on  close it down  and do you  remember here's  an odd question  do you remember  the last time  that you were  lousy like  like something  you did like  years ago that  you're like oh  god was I  awful enough  I wasn't too  kind to my  wife the other  day  oh yeah  oh sure  in fact in  fact uh friends  of mine uh have  a humiliation  night where they  ask you to bring  an ass actors 
[01:40:30]  to bring your  worst shit over  wow you know  how easy it is  to be me and  bring everything  no and see  that's it you  have to call  through that and  say this is the  worst I've ever  been what a great  idea is and you  drink you're  drinking all  night long and  you're laughing at  everyone else's  brutal horrible  performances it's  great you're just  ripping each other  completely we've  had some of the  stand-ups come in  and and we played  some of their early 
[01:41:00]  material and some  of their videos and  and we've actually  yeah we we played  some of our radio  shows when we were  first on the radio  just happy to be  there five minutes  after the big hour  five o'clock here  just embarrassing  but that's gotta be  pretty nerve-wracking  just sitting there  with your friends  goofing on your uh  yeah your work the  last time we did it  was with uh seth  mcfarland he was  over and we were  drinking and he he  did an on-camera  thing on star trek  the the tv series and 
[01:41:30]  he was this he was  really stiff and in  the background and you  know he's doing it  marching it looked  like he had  something stuck up  his ass it was funny  so funny it is  embarrassing to watch  so even though you're  getting laughs from  your friends it really  is on some level  like oh god is that  rough what did you  bring i brought this  uh i brought this  thing called crisis  counselor which was a  a really bad uh one  of the early reality  shows back in like  1980 i want to say  and uh it was kind 
[01:42:00]  of an improv uh show  dealing with um with  uh therapy sessions  group therapy sessions  and they would only  tell you basically what  you are and then  everything else just  just comes out and uh  i i played this guy  who uh had uh who  was married and his  wife is pregnant and  he has a male lover  on the side and and i  was told you need to  make this right on the  show you just need to  say what's wrong with 
[01:42:30]  this and i went really  and so my arguments  were like i don't know  i just you know she  was a little sick so i  thought i'd uh step  away have myself a  lover  were you playing it up  like that not unlike  any other guy would do  go get yourself a love  a male lover uh you  know when your wife is  pregnant right and it's  like they're looking at  me like what you're such  an ass and so everybody  else on the panel was  was you know throwing 
[01:43:00]  daggers at me and i'm  trying to this weak  argument anyway we had  a blast they were oh  and it carved me up  quite a bit you know  how uh i i guess back  then you'd never thought  this would end up for  public consumption but  all this stuff can be  found on youtube and  everything's available  and back then it was  like all right that's  gone forever it's never  going to see the light  of day never surface  and here you go there  it is yeah that's yep  they're telling us you  have to leave they're  telling us uh oh that 
[01:43:30]  you have to great show  and yeah great tremendous  actor i love it uh it  if if you have not seen  it you have like uh maybe  what the weekend to do a  big long marathon to see  four seasons catch up i  would do it i'd run two  tvs at once and do two  episodes at the same time  it's uh it's fantastic i  love it and like i said  when you were here last  time the uh the first  episode of the first season  grabs you yeah the only  comparison i have really 
[01:44:00]  is is the lost pilot was  like that when yes all  of a sudden there's a  plane crash people walk  around they're like what  is going on here yeah and  you have to stick around  for it and that's exactly  what breaking bad it  fantastic show huge fan  brian thanks you guys  love it all right  appreciate it  this is the worst of the  opian anthony show  sirius xm  worst of opian anthony my  name is eric and uh opian 
[01:44:30]  anthony are off this week  they return on monday with  some more new live shows for  you but for now you'll just  have to deal with uh whatever  it is that we put in front of  you we're doing breaking bad  today that's the theme and uh  we just spoke with brian  cranston who plays walter  white on breaking bad the show  just came back for its final  episodes last night on amc you  can see it every sunday night  at 9 p.m eastern time who  knows what time it is if you  live anywhere else uh we're  moving on to anna gun she  plays skylar walter white's  wife on the program and uh 
[01:45:00]  have to say she came in she  was looking pretty damn good  she doesn't look quite like  skylar on the tv show she  looks even better in person  here it is anna gun  we got anna gun uh walking  into the studio hi anna take a  seat make yourself comfy  we're actually on the air  do you mind if i eat a little  bit oh eat you sure are you  hungry kind of hungry i'm a  little hungry oh she's a  beautiful woman i don't know  eating in front of her yeah 
[01:45:30]  look at my one's right  orange i wanted to you know  wake you guys up a little  well that you did her awake  that you did thank you uh of  course skylar hello uh from  breaking bad i mean um i've  been fully immersed in the  show for uh since the  beginning and um what do you  what do you say because i got  to bring up everybody seems to  want you dead on the show not 
[01:46:00]  everybody all right not  everyone only those who you  know well who identify with go  ahead i just say it's a tribute  to your your acting thank you  because uh you know sometimes  it's like oh boy she's kind of  getting in the way of things  that's what it is i think it's  the people who really identify  with walt and they and and you  know that's the point of the  show i mean that's that's what's  brilliant about the show there  people really get behind the story  of walt and they and they get  behind the idea of a guy who's 
[01:46:30]  been really pushed down by life  and disappointed and has had to  take a lot of things that he  didn't want in life and i think  that uh vince wrote him so  brilliantly and brian plays him  so brilliantly yeah that people  root for him and they cheer for  him and he is both the  protagonist and the anti-hero oh  yeah time yeah so it's such a  brilliant construct and then in a  way skylar is kind of the  antagonist because she's the one 
[01:47:00]  who stands in the way of him  doing whatever he wants to do  most of all right and that makes  some people kind of pissed off  yeah because like the the viewers  they see someone like uh walter  kind of progress through the show  from this schleppy kind of guy right  uh and and very realistically and  gradually he turned uh almost out of  necessity for every instance of evil  that he does yeah it's almost like 
[01:47:30]  well he wouldn't do that and then  well i guess he has to now right  kind of gets caught up in it i know  so much and yeah you get in there  the voice of reason to a point um  and people like hey get out of his  way i know what are you doing  exactly it's really it's really  bizarre and we were at first the  writers and vince and i were like  what is going on why are people so  upset but it really is i think it's  really about that that they just want  him they want they put themselves in 
[01:48:00]  him and in his corner so much and she  is the one more than i mean even more  than the villains in the show like  gus fring or you know or tuco or any  of those really bad guys who for a  while were bigger threats than anybody  else she's the consistent one who says  this is not okay you can't do this yeah  yeah and she's the one who kind of  stands there and says there are  consequences there are repercussions  and that makes people upset  psychologically it really gets in there  and does something to them and it's 
[01:48:30]  kind of brilliant that it's kind of  brilliant it's amazingly brilliant yeah  because again as a viewer you almost  want to see how far walter is going to  go with without somebody holding him  back exactly so you sit there and go  like oh god skyline getting in it again  i know why make him stop don't you know  but isn't that what kind of prevents  us from becoming like a cartoon of  somebody is the fact that in real life  you do have people in your way or you  do have people in your ear and it's  like without that and all of a sudden 
[01:49:00]  it's just like it's like a superman  yeah it makes sense like how would the  issue he would just go off the rails and  i think it would become you know kind of  ridiculous and i think vince knew that  yeah and the other thing was that vince  from the beginning he said i don't want  you like whenever i'm a pretty emotional  person and i'm a pretty you know i play  i i'm very emotions are very much on the  surface for me so yeah when i first found  out for for example about his cancer  diagnosis tears jumped to my eyes and  vince very specifically said skylar is 
[01:49:30]  not a person where emotions come to her  easily they're very they're they're  they're deeply buried in her so it was  important for him for her to be a really  really kind of strong steely person yeah  and that's what he wanted from her and  again that also sometimes makes people  feel like i don't know if i like that  because they think bitch yeah and that  word gets thrown around and that's a  little tough you know that's not tough  to handle because you think why is that 
[01:50:00]  bitchy she's actually just a kind of  formidable strong person and why is it  bitchy to just be strong and to stand  toe-to-toe with a man and say yeah okay  it's it's so odd to have a show where a  lot of the before waltz uh getting into  making meth wasn't shown but you could  see the result of what your lives were  yeah during all those years of him just  being the teacher you being the housewife 
[01:50:30]  and mother and you could see without  even having to show it what it produced  yeah and set it up so we could get into  the you know the unbelievable craziness  of uh... what what happened did you have  a back story that you had to kinda here's  what your life was yeah i mean brian and  i talked a lot about it because there  wasn't much there but we really kind of  created this idea of what drew these  people together and certainly there was  we felt a real attraction and love 
[01:51:00]  between them but we thought the thing  that probably was the the biggest  attraction between them was their  intellect i think skylar is as smart as  walters as intellectually smart as he is  she is his equal in that right and so and  it's also both it's their downfall as as  human beings really i mean they think  they're kind of smarter than everybody  and everyone else well you know so that's  why in a way as the show goes on they  become almost like the macbeths in a way 
[01:51:30]  because they think that they can outsmart  everybody else they think they can  create these lies and these and to a  point they have been i mean it but you  know obviously things uh change with the  the last half of the last season coming  up this is it obviously uh yeah i was i  was so lucky i got an advance copy of the  first episode of this i loved it don't  worry no spoilers it was nice you to put  it online too people are saying that 
[01:52:00]  they're like come on put that up online  like you don't think i want another one  maybe at some point and be like here's  another one i am not saying anything or  don't but it it is totally in line with  everything that the the magnificence that's  been the show up till now um the beginning  kind of showing you a little advance yeah  view of things because they've done that  before in the past and um and then the 
[01:52:30]  way the way walter the character walter can  explain something to somebody in a way that  is so soft and yet just punches you in the  face exactly is uh and obviously you know  what scene i'm talking about it's just  because he pulled those shenanigans with  you in one episode yeah where it's like  hey you know you best you best know who  you're talking to kind of a thing  exactly when he does that thing where  he's he's talking to you and you're  you're drawn into him yeah yeah and you 
[01:53:00]  you think oh okay he's really saying  something sincere yeah he's going to  apologize or he's going to show any  regret and no yeah it's pretty much a  threat yeah it's yeah it's amazing  starting to lean into him thinking oh my  gosh he's so sincere and then all of a  sudden he turns it and he does that  thing you know with his eyes when he  gets all heisenbergian where he suddenly  does this heisenbergian and he does that  little thing with his eyes where all of  a sudden and even acting with him 
[01:53:30]  because i you know obviously i know  brian really well and he's a great guy  and yeah he's funny and and and sweet  and lovely but all of a sudden he does  this thing where his eyes just narrow and  they get hard and even acting with him  is a little bit like i'm i'm gonna back  up a little bit yeah yeah take a little  step back he's uh he is an amazing  actor to pull this role off also and  then we've had him in before and i was  talking to him about how it's so odd to  see a little bit he denied it but you 
[01:54:00]  could see it when he's kind of because  there are parts that are actually funny  in the show oh yeah and it's almost part  of that malcolm in the middle dad a  little bit of that comes through uh  absolutely at times and i think that's i  i don't know him but i would assume  he's kind of like that in real life he  is he seems to have a very good sense of  humor he's got a great sense of humor and  those long intense scenes that we had to  do together you know those are those are  pretty rough to keep up for 12 hours a  day so there was a lot of laughing and 
[01:54:30]  pranks and i wouldn't doubt it yeah and  you were both uh in seinfeld we were  both in seinfeld we were we have that yeah  yeah dr watley and exactly and you're in  the one with the uh glasses george's  glasses and he had the wrong glasses  and insisted that it was um  jerry's uh cousin that's right kissing  somebody yeah and it turned out to be the  the police police woman kissing her  horse exactly  he gets like but my cousin looks like a  horse  it was the best 
[01:55:00]  that was fantastic i watch the show all  the time so anybody that's on seinfeld  i'm just like ah it's fantastic how do you  feel uh with the show ending that's gotta  suck it's really bittersweet i mean this  this we wrapped in late march and we all  had a good cry but we knew that we were  going to have this kind of farewell tour  in a way and so we knew we were going to  have all this time to spend together but  now that this is actually coming to an  end  we've had some panels we had a new york 
[01:55:30]  times panel last night and we all kind  of started tearing up a little bit of  crying in public now because it really  is coming to an end and we know that  this time together is truly coming to an  end and that's that's hard because this  has been the luckiest job of all of our  careers we know that and it's fantastic  that you could take um i guess five  seasons yeah ends up being uh and not and 
[01:56:00]  stop it where people want more obviously  people want this to continue but to make  that commitment to know this is what it  is is uh it's brave it's very brave it's  brave because obviously you could milk a  show right and they do nothing left they  do it all the time yeah um but it seems  like the perfect length for this to turn  around and and from talking what is six  seasons be the perfect uh six one more one  more one more like it is six because 
[01:56:30]  five five and a half five and a half  five and a half like six i know that  just from having done like like little  teeny episode work and stuff you get  attached to people quickly like you form  a weird bond with people you do see if  you're there for more than one day yeah  it's like you see each other craft  services like all of a sudden like yeah  your pals yeah they go on to much bigger  things and they feel no connection but i  can't imagine doing season after season  with the same people and then having to 
[01:57:00]  call it quits yeah yeah way to it's rough  it's true but the last day when i wrapped  brian and aaron and i had a group hug and  there was a little bit of crying but then  brian said you know just think in six  months we won't remember each other's  there there was a great scene with uh you  guys when aaron was eating over the house  that was the best that was one of the  greatest uh scenes how uncomfortable you  guys made it it was so uh he's just  babbling about something walter's looking 
[01:57:30]  at me you're just so angry so angry  guzzling my wine yeah just drinking at  that point and uh but everything fits so  well the writing is done so well uh on  that show it's brilliant it's brilliant  and i loved and aaron looks he's sitting  in between us like he's the uncomfortable  kid between the few parents just looking  at us like oh god i wish it was anywhere  else in the world we had to stop  ourselves from cracking up the entire  yeah yeah and then he ate so many green  beans that at the end of that scene he 
[01:58:00]  said i'm never gonna eat a green bean  again oh really a few takes yeah quite a  few now are you have you looked at other  scripts and stuff since this ended or  like yeah i'm getting a lot of really  interesting um scripts i'm looking at a  lot of movie scripts right now and i i  went to uh the sundance institute this  summer and i did the director's lab and  i did this really interesting role that  was kind of like a female walter white  kind of character yeah it's the  psychological portrait of the making of  a zealot and it's a but it's the the  female kind of version of that so that 
[01:58:30]  was really interesting so hopefully we'll  get that made this year yeah so you want  to do a movie as opposed to would it  be hard to do something episodic right  now because you're just coming off this  yeah i mean i i'm looking at some some  television stuff as well but i'm really  interested in doing some some film and i'm  also a big theater girl so i'm looking at  some theater projects as well yeah it's uh  it's amazing what can be done um off of  network television yeah that's why it i would  assume it's probably hard to be offered  something on a network where it's like you 
[01:59:00]  know i was just able to read dialogue that  was so realistic and yeah and to go to  episodic um network television gotta be  rough yeah i mean this is some of the  best writing that any any of us have ever  encountered yeah and when you come off of  writing like this it's the bar is so high  so we're i mean it's just so lucky but  then you're kind of spoiled so you have to  choose carefully so um but but it's opened a  lot of doors for all of us so yeah we're in 
[01:59:30]  we're in a good place now obviously you  know you can't tell us anything um i'm  gonna tell you so nice um all of a sudden  vince gilligan comes yeah you will be  quiet yes um uh would there let's say  would there be any even possibility there  could later be a reunion of sorts i think  that's possible for sure i mean it depends  on the blogs on the phone what happens 
[02:00:00]  last day yes exactly who's still standing  and all that but you know there is talk  about the saul goodman spin-off so yes  who is a great another just a great  character amazing little comic relief in  there yeah he's uh he's good and by the  way he was in a seinfeld episode he was  another seinfeldian i just and if you  think i'm bad our producer travis ten  times worse than me he can quote all of 
[02:00:30]  them my father can quote every seinfeld  episode it's just that to talk about  another just brilliant show for the time  and everything i know yeah but they went  more than five seasons you can make it oh  yes nine seasons yeah they did well i guess  for the comedy it's a little bit easier  than with an actual drama with a real story  yeah you just keep going yeah i thought  that the scene uh the episode where  jerry becomes a a meth dealer uh was  great it was uh maybe that would be  interesting maybe you guys could all like 
[02:01:00]  do something together as a cast but just  a totally different story  you know what somebody said that at the  new york times thing they said seeing  you all sitting up there it's a shame to  see you you know maybe you're a hat  distributor and brian owns a hat store  i love it you guys work on trying to get  the hats for certain prices that's  terrible that's a great idea what a waste  of resources i always wanted a dramatic  slash comedic slash endearing piece about 
[02:01:30]  hats terrible behind the scenes on the  phone the one one one thing that has  been going around the internet which was  kind of funny is the fact that uh let's  say walter goes into witness protection  program and it becomes malcolm in the  middle everybody thinks that yeah  everybody that's and who's to say that  that that isn't what well i i like i  said i saw that first episode and uh if  that's any indication on the rest of this  i mean it's i just sat there when the 
[02:02:00]  credits came on i i yelled out no i know  no i know more exactly it's going to be  it's going to be sort of agony every week  for the audience to wait to to the next  for the for the next week's and now i get  the good thing that i saw the episode but  now i gotta wait two episodes to see  you gotta wait two weeks but i'll watch  that first one again yeah that was uh and  i popped the disc in and i'm like a riot  i'm ready to watch this and it comes on and  i'm seeing the scene i'm like all right i  gotta watch the last one again so i had to 
[02:02:30]  pull it out because from the last screw  with you yeah so i watched the last  season's last uh episode and they're  going because they always start off uh  these shows with something that you don't  think makes any sense exactly you're  looking at a flower you're looking at  that and and this one you're just seeing  skateboards right skateboards and you're  like all right why am i saying this did i  miss something yeah and it all makes  sense and uh it's it's fantastic it's  great and it launches i mean it's like a  it's like they they don't ease you into  this since you've seen that first one oh 
[02:03:00]  they shoot you off like a it's like a  right away you're like what is going and  that scene where she drops the growth  that's great you're loving that you have  inside info you're loving it look at i  love it are you feeling resentful right  yes but for many other reasons where do  we begin you got two hours great skyler  and a gun thanks so much for coming in  thank you you're a doll and a love you

[02:06:00]  much better  betsy you're of course hank's wife uh  marie on um breaking bad yes uh i i am i am  completely involved completely involved in  the show i am not like i'm not one of  these you know oh i watched an episode  because i knew you were coming in i've  been watching i have heard that you guys  are fans huge i love that it's more fun 
[02:06:30]  to talk about it it really is inside yes  and i uh i i i got the uh i got the  advanced copy of the first episode did you  see it i thought for the first time last  night did you yeah it's so good right  yeah i was like the last eight episodes  are just so amazing just so amazing and  you know it's just this culmination of  everything that's been happening and it's  going to it's not going to end well i  know it's it can't be this happy fun  little ending with the way this is going 
[02:07:00]  i don't know what it is you you probably  do but i don't know how it's going to end  but it can't be good is that right i feel  like two bubbles if he's right it was two  pops yeah or yes one for another oh that's  three everybody dies in the fire oh my god i  guess anna's in an interview someone said um  that anna said that you know the show  doesn't end prettily yeah and i didn't they 
[02:07:30]  said you know is that a spoiler and i said  i think happy ending for these people left the  station like oh yeah yeah season two very  early on you're not going to get uh you're  not going to get an ending where the music  goes right no nothing like that hey look  what we got here oh my god they know  it's so weird where does he go where does  he go come here dean take a seat right  there that's oh look oh the happy couple  the happy couple now the bubbles are 
[02:08:00]  popping oh they are popping dean  norris is in studio he's sitting on  betsy's lap you look so handsome doesn't he  look great yeah yeah that's his lap is  the party over already is it over is the  party over no party no party's going oh  good you just got here honey how could  begin it's so odd to see like you you  guys are a tv show couple and there you  are it's like watching lucy and ricky it's 
[02:08:30]  amazing he never stops working okay never  never stopped working he's landing the  space shuttle right there yeah yeah uh of  course uh hank yes sir from breaking bad uh i  was just saying i i saw the advanced copy i've  i've been fully involved in uh the show over  the entire course of it and then i i finally  saw the uh the first episode of the new  season without any spoilers or anything i  got to tell you wow wow i was 
[02:09:00]  sitting there just not wanting that screen  to go dark and have the credits come up  because now i gotta wait and and the the  the closing scene of that is just it's  brutal it's it's subtle brutality yeah  because uh i mean walter gives that a  threat it's a threat yeah i'll say that  much but it's done in that inimitable quiet 
[02:09:30]  style yeah yeah and as the hank's wife what  role are you going to play in this i mean  that things are going down we know from  last season of course hank took that dump  and uh and and picked up that book that  pretty much revealed what was going on and now  how do you mean what role am i gonna you  talk about his dump and then you ask me what  role i'm going to play i mean she changed my  bedpan in season four but he comes out of  the the bathroom and then marie comes out  she's washing her hands you go through this uh 
[02:10:00]  series with uh you're very naive what do  you mean i don't know you kind of you're not  really willing to accept that something bad's  going on oh well is it is it that she's not  you just popped my bubble that's right  it's not that she's naive she doesn't know  yeah but like like you gotta look at walt yeah 
[02:10:30]  wait what sister-in-law would be like  i you know what i think i think walt's a  drug kingpin all right ugly ass shoes  green car he's clearly okay good point  but you'd think being married a paranoid  person a dea guy maybe something would  rub off or you'd get the little info or  you'd you stay out of his work except  when you're getting his rocks i don't  think marie stays out of anything my  rocks what right getting his rocks off 
[02:11:00]  i don't think no you can say that  you say motherfucker motherfucker that's  you it's fucking rocks they were minerals  right your rocks are here they're  fucking minerals god damn so good  does not be on tv and you can say  fuck  i know all i do like for the last like  two weeks is not say fuck and not say  the ending of breaking bad right right  those are the two things you're not  allowed to do are we not supposed to say  the ending oh man well you can't  you're my wife you can say whatever the 
[02:11:30]  fuck you say the ending  well i want to i want to know it no one  wants to don't want to know i want to see  it i know i want to see it happen you  don't want to know it no do you know  now sometimes you guys don't know it  oh yeah we know all right sometimes you  guys come in you're from a series and  you don't know for sure what are they on  with a meth  they know it's uh yeah this this is this is  it this is the the end and it has to be a 
[02:12:00]  little has to be a little emotional right  oh man seriously yeah especially this  week sorry what yeah  did you get me a coffee dean  could you order me a coffee  straight up  that's like that's how i do my liquor  baby yeah you sure you're good yeah i  had a cup of coffee this morning  i had some chocolate with my real  husband oh damn i didn't say that to be  mean but it sounded mean and i didn't  mean it  you know i'm married in real life oh man  you know that right  this is ruining everything 
[02:12:30]  yeah i need to tell you i'm so sorry  a little late isn't it hey but i'm  always thinking but i'm always thinking  about you baby  you're who i really love  when you play a couple do you get is  there any like real attraction there  it's got to be difficult to not feel  something if you're playing a married  couple  i don't feel i feel absolutely nothing  not me i feel it all  it's a job they go cut i run i feel it  all 
[02:13:00]  no i miss you so much in all seriousness  in all seriousness  it was such an amazing thing to have  betsy brandt play uh play my wife more  than i can tell you i i'll it's just she  just added so much you know her inner  like humanity comes out in the role and  and it just it's such a it's such a it's  such a great thing because i think it was  such a big part of hank's like um  his his own morality you know it stemmed if  he wasn't married he would have broke  bad a long time ago yeah yeah i feel 
[02:13:30]  and i feel like having betsy play um  uh marie just it will always be like  just a an amazing part of for me a  memory of the show because she brought  all that to it and it was like oh man  it's just awesome oh shush  it does seem like the only real real  true loyalty you have is to you the  family to your family and and that pretty  much holds you from probably yeah  going the way of walter going really  bad and he kind of would just think 
[02:14:00]  back at least i did as a character  would always in the kind of crucial  moments and there are some more crucial  moments coming up um would always just  think back to to my wife you know and  go all right that's why i got to be  strong and that's why i got to be the  good guy and yeah and go from there i  love that's true i love being a part of  this couple yeah to and to do that with  you and you know but even from the  beginning i just i love that they would  do anything for each other and in the  show work people are just horrible to  each other you know decapitate this guy 
[02:14:30]  and stick his head on a turtle and we  have this beautiful relationship  yin yang i think that's yes yeah in the  middle of all that you know i always i  always loved that and trouble yeah  like i always refer back to a uh a scene  where hank is uh basically leaving the  dea and he gets this elevator and you  never see him make a phone call or  anything but somehow his wife just  knows it's a bad day and um and she  shows up and she shows up and i remember 
[02:15:00]  on that day on like this like like a  second i remember remember we i said  just don't look at me until we do do the  take um it was the only time i said  some crazy meth you know method acting  like that but i did because it was such  an emotional moment and i just couldn't  but as soon as i looked at her it was  just you know tears you know just  because you know it's like the worst  day and he's like fuck and then he  and the elevator opens and it's his wife  you know yeah yeah wow that is  you know how hard it was for me in that 
[02:15:30]  moment not to cry and i remember asking  frida who did our makeup at the time  i said did we get it did we get it did  they tell you we got it and they said  yes and then i just sobbed  i did a lot on the show koops marie  doesn't let go and cry and also i think  in that moment she just wouldn't she's  like no it's all about you baby oh yeah  yeah you know it's not it's not about  me you know it's not about me crying and  it's you know it's about me being there  for you yeah and awesome well that's  getting really deep into your your  character when you're you're on set like  that yeah it was so fun it was fun i'm 
[02:16:00]  gonna miss it when did you when did you  wrap how long ago end of march beginning  of april really don't even know i feel  like i'm in this wow man time zone that i  really don't even know but i bet that  sounds right what he says sounds right  so you've been you've been doing uh  press and stuff and and then i guess  that's kind of wow and then you're just  you're done it's crazy it's kind of  hitting me now this week like when we  wrapped i had to go to another job and  so did you and so it was less um i 
[02:16:30]  don't know just i mean it was yeah you  were kind of emotional about it but it  wasn't this week though it's like this  kind of final victory tour you know and  it's like yeah wait a minute i'm not  gonna see i thought i was doing better  with it than i am now now that i'm like  wow last premiere wait what do you mean  last yeah that's not coming back yeah  we can fake it though we can like just  make a problem i asked him i asked him  we'll show it again i told amc last night  i said if you bankroll it i'll shoot three  more  we'll show up and do the work just three  more i know who wouldn't who wouldn't 
[02:17:00]  that's what i said as long as they bankroll  it and i think it's a kind of a goofy  spin-off where you're almost like uh the new  ropers  i'm sorry you're already on another  sitcom my bad oh that's right i'm sorry  you're stuck in a bubble  that's a dumb motherfucker  what is that how do you do that oh man  how do you do that it's a bad  when you touch it and it gets all weird 
[02:17:30]  steven spielberg man oh you make fun of steven spielberg is that what you're doing you want to  make fun of steven spielberg and his and his tv show yeah how about  steven king you want to make fun of him too no okay no i'm not making fun of  anybody dean i'm just asking about the special effects under the dog i can't watch that show  at night really really for real i can't i told my husband i'm like we cannot watch it before  we're good about too creepy i can't it's just freaks me out yeah it's like be trapped in there  it's crazy well they're all under there so it's kind of nice oh i just got a pit feeling in my  little microcosm of humanity under the dome there but you're stuck you're all stuck what you're 
[02:18:00]  gonna do with all that fuel what you can  stay tuned  what you gonna do and betsy uh you're working with michael j fox yes that's got to be pretty  damn cool it's great and now easy easy easy okay thank you um but temper that he  but he's pretty great watch it yeah i know do you just feel compelled domestic violence is like this 
[02:18:30]  do you feel compelled to just ask michael j fox back to the future questions oh no i would just  ask him that all the time but how did this how many deloreans were in that one scene if you think  about it you'd be just be like shut up no i don't but i do feel compelled to go  sha-la-la-la all right well the that family from family ties the the theme song yes  sha-la-la i hope you can get the rights to that otherwise this whole time that is pretty good that 
[02:19:00]  you two go from breaking bad to you know other hit shows very hit show yeah yeah i mean come on  not too shabby yeah you're gonna have to watch your language though i didn't know i yeah yeah that's  another thing good at that yeah yeah i'm pretty you can't turn to michael j fox and go what the  fuck are you doing like oh man that is usually how i talk to people i think you confuse me with  my friend dean norris are you uh normally uh more reserved or a little potty mouth oh no i'm a potty 
[02:19:30]  mouth but i try and keep it in check with my children yeah huh how old are your kids uh eight  and four and a half oh yeah those are those uh very formative years where they'll just pick up  everything right you know there's that time where you're like oh my my little boy when he was a  toddler was like oh he's not like he's not he's not listening he's not talking and then like he  spilled his sippy cup and he goes god damn it and i told my husband i said it's not like he's trying  to say fork and he says fuck which we think is hilarious you know instead of sitting he says 
[02:20:00]  shit also really funny there's plenty of videos out there yeah and then i posted it on my facebook  page i go my my little boy said uh god damn it today i said he totally gets that fucking shit from  my husband it's a fucking shit language so a little bit of a potty mouth a little bit but i  really try and keep it in check it's just sometimes there's no better word fuck's a great word yeah  it's no better word it is uh people should get off their ass about it too right 
[02:20:30]  fuck you man it's a great word we were talking about uh breaking bad and how how it's it's so good to  have these networks now that allow real gritty language like that because years ago you had tv  shows detective shows or whatnot and it just took that edge off of it dang it yeah yeah you're like  no one would darn it it takes away from the character absolutely uh because they would they  would talk like that right yeah yeah uh and uh the hank character is um is great and for the entire 
[02:21:00]  series you're just like come on but although you you love walter you don't want him getting caught  but you don't want hank looking like a total idiot but he doesn't i mean no that's just how amazing is  that the great writer you haven't caught him and it's and it's so and you clearly you're smart your  character is smart thank you your character is so smart but he doesn't need that like i need that from 
[02:21:30]  you thanks oh i thought it was really stupid thanks for like well they do sound married i'm not gonna  tell you you're handsome anymore yes you know i'm not sexy no i'm not oh come on come on i can't help  it yes you're sexy dean norris oh god damn it you're so sexy but how seriously how great is that writing  it is that you can have this whole cat and mouse thing it works for both of you right i always thought  that was uh really uh because he got me so close and it made sense that he didn't quite get any figures  out gus fring and he figures out some other things you know but i thought it was it was 
[02:22:00]  sometimes it's funny there's one scene it's not a very popular scene but where i'm almost kind of  catching them and walt head squeals up next to me and he kind of distracts me and and he does his  little kind of malcolm in the middle thing yeah the malcolm in the middle guy i was like whoa what the  hell's this guy you know yeah but uh so there's times where it's funny that he did he i think hank  doesn't catch him and other times it's serious but i always thought it was good writing that they got  absolutely out of it so i do like when he pops in with that malcolm in the middle character  every so often it's so goofy it is and and then when you think of how ruthless he is yeah it makes 
[02:22:30]  it that much better yeah one of my favorite scenes is when you're loading up the bags in the car  and you said what you got in here a million bucks in cash yeah right so funny yeah or when uh you  you notice the um ww the first time and he just goes you got me and it's like no it is him yeah come  on did you really want to be killed off in the first season to do a comedy pilot it wasn't the first  season it was it was i'll explain that they they picked up um the last season and it was 16 instead 
[02:23:00]  of 13. so we go okay great they're going to shoot all 16 and then we'll be free to do other stuff  and then the you know the corporate can i say douchebags yeah sure what are they going to do fire you  so these douchebags decide that they're going to split it into two eight things for their own  financial purposes sure give me the fuck about my financial reasons so i got to sit there and wait 
[02:23:30]  a whole year because i can't do anything else because i'm contracted to do a measly eight more  episodes right so i'm like you know i got i got a few kids to feed myself and i said how about it  wouldn't be great if the if the cliffhanger of the first eight since you're going to do it this way  uh hank dies that way it frees me up to do another show and of course they said no because we need  you for the last eight i'm glad they did and they ultimately did free me up in time and you too  to do another show but originally that wouldn't have been the case then you'd be sitting on your  ass for another year waiting for another pilot you know that's got to be frustrating i was like you 
[02:24:00]  know i'll i mean i love the show and i'm down with art and all that stuff but you know i i i act to  live i don't live that you know what i'm saying i love that you're such an opposite of some of the people  come through here yeah the whole time i don't do anything i stood for four years in the desert  just to do the last eight episodes i don't care i'll start me i'll start like fuck it man i need  another job you know pay me yeah it's called under the dome cbs baby yeah under the dome 
[02:24:30]  motherfucker that's huge that is huge you were in fucking total recall i know i wasn't you  no no not you before my time you got a lot of nerve showing your face around here  that's before my time look who's talking that's the lot you got a lot of nerve showing you  around here who are you in turn me to i think i i think i believe it or not i think i was probably  the highest paid per line because i had like one line and i was on that movie for like two months 
[02:25:00]  this is back in the day when they would take like you know they didn't give a shit carolco was  throwing money out you know and we're like oh wow you're seeing you're paying me to sit here for a  month in a hotel great then i go and do one line you know i forgot what the line was i i show up  i'm a swat team leader and i show up and i want to point the gun at somebody and say something like  don't do it or something how much did you get paid per word i'm saying if you had two months to pay  for you know one word that ain't bad that ain't bad yeah no shit bye what what else have you what  like what did you early on uh work on anything we'd know i i have i didn't dig in thank you not 
[02:25:30]  you jimmy you could find it i know video stores if you know what i'm saying um a lot of some people  call it adult films i call them art um that's how i met dean i win oh and he said let me get you on  the show the show i'm doing on cable um i i did mostly uh you know i did some movies but it's smaller  indie movies i did one movie with blythe danner and peter fonda which was really fun and then i did um 
[02:26:00]  just a lot of drama on tv yeah and it's like once you start doing drama people choose that and then  you just do more of it but it was really fun to do you want some lifetime movies no where the husband  all of a sudden he's the greatest guy in the world and then oh boy no the best friend always knows he  was a scumbag right no i never did anything like that but what i am i am disappointed i never um did a  uh uh that show with david caruso uh nypd uh no no no csi miami csi miami oh i did nypd blue 
[02:26:30]  yes the first season with david caruso yes and i had and i was ready to go that was one of my that  was my first serious tv gig and i had a contract to go for the second season i'm like all excited  and i'm saying over the summer i hear fucking caruso decides that he's gonna quit and do movies and do  movies jade that worked out that was a good one that was the worst decision that was worse than  fucking mclean stevenson leaving mash that was the number one that's probably the worst decision  you know yeah yeah it's one of them you know it's one of them because i was a best friend so my like 
[02:27:00]  six episodes i was going to do the next year yeah your character all of a sudden becomes irrelevant  yeah yeah wow that was really it was early on when that mattered you know and that would  yeah you're probably like well that's it i'll never act again yeah i'm never going to get  another gig in my car half the time i've been in l.a i've been on breaking bad wow not yeah  isn't that crazy yeah that's crazy that's most of it so i've really been in new mexico yeah i know  betsy has to go yeah that's all that sounds like i have to pee you have to go

[02:32:30]  reactions from people are amazingly uh yeah visceral uh and the beginning you know at the very beginning  of it and not giving anything away but the way they just start the show and you're like what the  i know is this yeah yeah that was all that's a great it's a great teaser it really is a great  teaser yeah and uh you know again not spoiling anything but the neighbor uh awesome and then they  come back to that line yes yeah it's fantastic there's a lot of inside talk here oh well you know 
[02:33:00]  what it's very very i think they'll have to uh watch uh listen to this interview and get what we're  talking about oh he was talking about i know what i want to ask what did you uh you went to harvard  what did you go to harvard for uh because i got in let me rephrase that yes not not why did you go  to harvard but like what was your uh what was your measure uh it's called the concentration at harvard hate 
[02:33:30]  to be that guy but um it was called social studies it was like uh economics history philosophy and  politics all kind of wrapped into one um and um it was great and you did well i did yeah i was  i was an honors i was an honor guy so you went you went why you not the why did you do acting but  did your family go like you probably shouldn't be acting if you graduated with artists or you know it  all all seriousness i was the first kid to go first guy to go to college at all from my family both  my parents didn't go to college and we came from you know kind of a lower middle you know middle 
[02:34:00]  class to lower middle class uh so one would think i had the pressure to go into like you know investment  banking or be an attorney or something like that but my parents were cool as all all get out and they  were happier in a way that i went in to do something that i wanted to do um and uh so i had complete  support of my parents yeah oh wow yeah were you acting in college or did you like yeah i did a lot  acting in college um it was all extracurricular because they didn't have really any you know there  wasn't like an acting uh program or anything like that at harvard but i got to work with some really 
[02:34:30]  interesting people uh like amy breneman was in in my year uh the directors uh uh like r.j cutler and  bill roush who who work today in the business very successful and uh i learned uh learned the craft i would  do maybe three a semester so six a year in terms of uh plays there and then learned a lot the american  repertory theater was there um and uh got to work with them a little bit as well what got you into  acting at all like what i'm a failed musician i'd like to have been a uh you know rock band really 
[02:35:00]  yeah okay but it didn't quite work out so i was like yeah yeah i'm in that boat yeah so i ended up  here we're the guys buying guitars at guitar center now we're like the hey man let me can i buy a new  strap because i can afford it now it sounds really good in my garage that's hilarious man i put i got  a band together actually maybe i don't know about i don't know 10 years ago with exactly that like 
[02:35:30]  some neighbors you know yeah we're like hey let's do a band man so we get out of the house on saturday  night it's still fun you know that's awesome man around my brother he plays out all the time and  shit and you know if he's ever like yeah i'm doing a gig over here why don't you come on by and you  know sing some stuff that's awesome it's just it's always been a lot of fun uh to do but when you  realize you just yeah the odds of making it or uh forget about it yeah uh so you are you you you  obviously like performing yeah and i mean i my you know my dad was like a you know had a band all his 
[02:36:00]  life that's how we made half his money but you know local local kind of band you know weddings and  bars and things like that and so i would play with uh play in the band with him sometimes and  so there it was always like and he came from a dad who uh he didn't know very well but was also a  musician wow so it was like rock and roll you know kind of musicians and then so it was in a way it was  kind of cool that i made it at least in the entertainment industry even though it wasn't music 
[02:36:30]  because it was a long tradition of people who kind of you know wish didn't want a real job yes pretty  much it i understand that completely man did not want to grow up exactly where where did you grow  up south in indiana south bend oh wow okay so what was there to do around there as a kid uh drink beer  drink yeah yeah blue collar uh kind of exactly very blue collar yeah uh and um it was great it was a  great place to grow up i love south and i go back there for notre dame games at least once a year 
[02:37:00]  cool yeah and i still have a sister who's there so did you have some like real shitty kind of regular  jobs growing up at all or well i yeah yeah it was like i washed dishes at 14 you know yeah it was  at the el adobe restaurant in uh in uh san juan capistrano california washing dishes at like 13. yeah  i washed dishes hot back there and yeah yeah and uh yeah that did yeah and i worked at uh and then as  i as a when i got to be an adult i started doing waiting jobs when i was in college yeah as a waiter in 
[02:37:30]  the summer oh a waiter slash actor that's something you never you never hear that oh yeah there's a  lot of them oh literal jimmy it was a great actually when i got i got my first gig in la it was it was  relatively soon when i mean within five months and i'm literally i was uh waiting tables and uh my agent  calls and says hey you gotta lead the weapon too i'm like oh what does that mean you know what the  the fuck that means you know well here's what it means it means x amount of times per week here's 
[02:38:00]  what it means i was like what you know it was like basically five times per week what i was making  of that i said are you sure i said he said yeah i guaranteed so i took my little waitress thing off  your waiter thing off said hey this hamburger goes to this table that guy gets the steak see you later  i'm mad yeah who are you in the weapon two that was a great one i was uh uh uh the guy that most  people remember it because uh i'm the guy we're playing poker and i go turn on the stereo and we  get blown up oh yeah yeah but if you look back we're in the whole front we're in the whole beginning 
[02:38:30]  that we're chasing people with mel gibson and all that kind of stuff yeah again this is a this is  the day when like that movie last 18 weeks i remember this because it was like a really important  number sure 18 weeks i worked on that show and uh and i still get paid today because everyone  watches you know they show it again and again and you still get like some checks for that oh  man seriously amazing god damn that must have been pretty good though like finally getting uh  getting a job being able to walk away from waiting tables yeah especially because the job that paid 
[02:39:00]  you enough that you didn't have to you know um and then the residual start coming in and then i  got to edit hard to kill right after that with uh and then i did a total recall so i was like oh okay  this is all right seems easy i'm in i'm in i'm in the door what's everyone complaining  i did one episode of lost like kind of a almost a kind of a cameo i did like two scenes in it yeah  oh who did you play lost i don't even remember some some guy who'd lost his his son or something  and some guy on loss was able to try to i don't know i was going to see if he can connect me with him 
[02:39:30]  in the afterworld or some shit like that one of those lost fucking storylines yeah i just did it  because it was like a classic show i think i was already on breaking bad and i was like i just  wanted to be on it because it's a classic yeah yeah actually the director was a guy named jack  bender who is the uh executive producer and director on under the dome now oh okay yeah oh really in  fact these are his uh i'm wearing his shoes right now what the yeah let me see those shoes yeah i see  there's paint on him paint because he's a painter and and like he so he's where he's a real legit 
[02:40:00]  painter right so he always wear him and he has like a kind of uh you know like scarves and  shit i'm like that man so we got drunk one night i literally i took him like this and i ripped  his shoes off and i and i have them to this day and you wear them i wear them yeah i took his shoes  right off his feet it's amazing they fit you know i can't but go to a sneaker store and buy  comfortable shoes yeah i would have wore them anyway if they didn't fit but uh but they happened to  fit and and he kind of struggled you know kind of drunkenly went home like barefoot i gave my shoes 
[02:40:30]  did you get to uh meet uh stephen king at all yeah oh man that's that yeah that's awesome man yeah  what a great guy he is and he's a really um really down to earth and funny and uh and a really good guy  yeah yeah he uh yeah it goes under the dome that's uh yeah his uh his based on his book yeah yeah  although we're deviating from his book but he's cool about that and he's he's down with that so  i started the book but i didn't finish it like it was great when i got through i'm just such a bad 
[02:41:00]  reader now but it was excellent when i said that's because you're trying to read like three four books  at a clip and i get none done and i just surf pornography every time i try stuff jerky off i'm like  i'm gonna start fucking reading keep your hands above the table yeah yeah right these computers don't work  do you uh do you do you pay attention to any critics on twitter or facebook or anywhere else  you know i i used to like when breaking bad first started because uh how am i doing yeah how am i 
[02:41:30]  doing and it just got so much as you can't you know if you start i think in the any more words of  either beyonce or somebody's never scroll down there you go never scroll down because there's always  there's always something waiting for you there's always some dickhead he's sitting there jerking  off in his basement you know fucking norris sucks fuck you you fuck i'm sitting here right now to  anybody who says shit to me on fucking that's great fuck you oh the scroll down's classic you're so 
[02:42:00]  right because you get a few you're like oh yeah i think i'm gonna scroll a little more and you always  scroll too far always i'm the best actor in the world right right fuck you right it always gets to  the and it negates all the good that's what vincent says he can he can read like 99 great things but  he'll only remember the one one shitty one the one shitty one and you know this asshole is you know  just a douchebag who's making shit out we would talk about this like so many times whereas like years  ago could you imagine if somebody had to sit down and write a letter hey clock cable you suck yeah it had to 
[02:42:30]  go in the mail fucking stamp mail and then it had to go through 15 levels of people right if it ever  got to him it would be a miracle right and now it's like any douchebag can just be like you suck  clark sucks yeah great they're writing that right now somewhere leave the guy alone yeah you bastards  what a piss it well it's been great to hang out and talk to you man uh you're obviously one of my 
[02:43:00]  my favorite shows that i watch and uh just a great character and if people they just don't  know what they're in store for when i saw just that first episode it's it sets up for an amazing  conclusion of uh breaking bad yeah i'll tell you what every one of these eight uh is as impactful  as the one you saw right right it really is i can't wait you know the one after another is like  oh are there people that are real real close to you that you go all right here's what happens is 
[02:43:30]  there one person that you've told no come on i swear that'd be tough that's crazy that wasn't  possible that one not even my wife my wife didn't read the scripts this year either so she know not  to ask at this point it's like a cia she doesn't want to ask you know she wants to watch it too like  that's true too i i want to know but i want to see it yeah the perfect thing would be if i got every  episode right now right and just watched it myself right bloated about it right you get people that say  like hey man how does it end and then literally like a split second later they go no i'm just 
[02:44:00]  kidding don't tell me don't tell me yeah yeah so no one really wants to know and i understand because  it's a it's a real joy to watch it unfold it is it's uh one of the most anticipated conclusions of a  series ever i think and the great thing about it is i think we get to go out going yeah we we ended  it correctly oh yeah you know or satisfactorily you know you i i was saying yesterday this show could  have gone for a few more years easily without even getting old right but uh to wrap it up in five 
[02:44:30]  seasons uh with the amazing writing amazing characters and and just an amazing story arc uh you can't  lose yeah i mean it's awesome actually yeah and you're on under the dome when is when is that on  that's uh it's on monday nights that's just you know it's i mean it's a crazy show yeah yeah  international we're the number one show ever in china u.s show really yeah we're like in 200  countries it's amazing man it's an insane concept it's an insane concept but it's it's like in it's  like the most it's like the highest rated show i think there's only one of the show higher in in 
[02:45:00]  like all the network tv it's crazy i mean in terms of scripted i don't know what these reality shows  are but in terms of scripted it's uh so it's like a whole it's a you know and it's great it's obviously  awesome to be on breaking bad and the greatness of it and and all but you know hollywood man you  know what they fucking respect numbers like you hang out in hollywood oh we love your show it's  such a great show you know really critically acclaimed you know now you're like you i got 
[02:45:30]  fucking three three in the demo bitch i love it dean thanks so much for coming in  this is the worst of the opian anthony show serious xm what is going on this is the worst of the opian  anthony show serious xm it's the worst of opian anthony my name is eroc eroc radio on twitter if you  care to follow opian anthony are off this week they return next monday and uh we were doing breaking bad 
[02:46:00]  but guess what we ran out of interviews so we're going to move on to some other stuff here and uh  this would be one of them things kids will never experience opian anthony like to portray that they're  children of the 80s try to be up on the latest trends and fashions and know what's going on in  pop culture this is one of those times where they're flashing back to things that they grew up with and  realize kids today the generations that are now or coming will never experience these things that they  had to go through while growing up and you know what it's probably a good thing this is the worst 
[02:46:30]  of the opian anthony show on sirius xm funny or die yesterday yeah had a post called the 11 more  nostalgic activities uh today's kids will never experience it's kind of a bit we've done but uh-huh  they've added to the list a little bit yeah but they make some good they bring back some good memories  that a lot of us older people have forgotten for example not knowing what was on tv while you were  watching tv remember you would fucking turn on the tv there was no tv guide there was no program guide 
[02:47:00]  well it was in the newspaper where the magazine the tv guy was right they're talking before even tv  guide where you would just turn on the tv and have to figure out what the hell was on all right look i  don't remember that i always remember there being a guide do you remember a guide always and i remember  i don't think we had a guy because we were poor newsday sunday paper we didn't get the paper we didn't  get tv guy in my house so well that's crazy so i am one of these people oh newsday used to have the 
[02:47:30]  uh sunday paper and then they would have the little tv guy that came with the paper and you'd use that  all week right and inside with little q a's with uh uh for tv and stuff and like a little crossword  puzzle you can't even afford a paper in my house what the was wrong america discovers colombo  they discover them what year is that so that's old so you were 71 groovy so you always had a tv  guy in your house always had a tv guide but very fortunate it it sucked at you were rich yeah yeah 
[02:48:00]  i was rich we didn't have that you didn't want to go through it though like you didn't you just kind  of did rally around the channels a little bit because rally around the channel yeah it was a pain  they have to pick up a tv guide and thumb through it all right well i i definitely remember no tv  guide or no uh program guide on the tv do you do do you remember getting the tv guide when you would  get the magazine because we had a subscription to it or whatever and i would look through it and go  right to don kirschner's rock concert to see it was saturday night to see what kiss was going to be i 
[02:48:30]  was only looking for kiss back then um and there was a couple of other ones uh what was the dick clark  one there was don kirschner and then there was uh america not american man no there was uh uh  he tried wolf fan jack no no no this was a big one this was on for years midnight special midnight  special that was wolf fan jack was on it oh okay midnight special and uh i would always look for  that and uh especially don kirschner to see if kiss was on ladies and gentlemen tonight we have kiss 
[02:49:00]  on don kirschner's rock concert dude it was amazing to look through the tv guide and see them listen i  could i would go crazy when i'd see kiss just just i would start going i would make like these little  nervous tics when i would see like kiss weeks the fan  you would make a little nervous yeah i was so i was so excited  like a little fucking yorkie you roll over and piss yourself dude i was so excited 
[02:49:30]  kiss brought an excitement level out of people absolutely that's hilarious i used to love kiss  too but i i grew up but yeah you would never grow noises and twitches when they would be on  fucking don kirschner's rock concert i just search out the rock magazines with kissing them and all  that and yes magazine or whatever the fuck it was at the time right yeah you'd wait all week  you'd have to wait all week then and it would just to see who was hosting like snl and all that crap  yeah because then when we did have access to that shit yeah you would you would uh search out your 
[02:50:00]  programs to see who was hosting whatever we're performing no on-screen guides though that was  you know things that you didn't even think about it was and you had to get up to change the channels  so let me tell you kids the other one they added to the list was knowing the satisfaction of watching  live tv remember the portable tvs the portable now obviously we could watch anything we want on our  phones yeah but remember like there was a big event maybe you had to fucking go to a stupid  wedding and the super bowl was on our big football game and someone always had that portable tv yeah 
[02:50:30]  the shitty reception trying to get a signal so you could get you know catch a glimpse of the game  that was pretty goddamn good did you have one of those portable tvs uh not that early on so it wasn't  like a real novelty by the time i got one it was like meh everyone's got one well that was when you  had the it was on your phone or first started on satellite right yeah yeah but even before that i had  like a portable tv handheld but it was uh with the antenna and everything but the cool thing  not not many people had them so when you found someone that had them it was kind of cool for 
[02:51:00]  the yeah but i i had to talk this way because we all have our phones and like you said you can  watch anything you want but and now those are totally obsolete even if you had one because if  you dig it out and put batteries in it there's no there's no signal to receive yeah there's really  no larry is really yeah it was funny i was at a garage sale and somebody had one of those old you  know the portable tvs and i was like oh that's cool the guy's like yeah it still works and i'm  like no it doesn't and he's like oh yeah it does and i just didn't feel like getting into it it's  getting into the fact that it's a digital signal now and when did the portable tv come out oh man 
[02:51:30]  it's a lot earlier than we think that's for sure they're showing the sony watchman yeah  in this picture do you remember in wall street when he's holding this little two-inch screen and he's  showing charlie sheen and he goes yeah for rudy like his kid was a big tech buff but that was it was so  funny we make fun of the big phone he had ah but he had a handheld tv a little tv but it was like a  little square it was so probably the watchman and at the time i bet you you thought it's it's never  going to get better than this no look at all the cool stuff we have now it's really hard to to think 
[02:52:00]  it's going to get better than this but it will but it will we'll look back on it will or like like  cheryl crow has a brain tumor we'll look back on stuff like that and go like wow how did they get  brain tumors but now we can technically we can see cancer cells or benign tumor cells building  when they're at 50 cells and they get wiped out by the little thing we have in us and we never get  cancer anymore people used to really get tumors you can't nano technology yeah yeah her brain tumor is  all right by the way yeah it's benign we're all but ten she's almost she's uh yeah she's being pretty 
[02:52:30]  casual about it actually i kind of remember seeing that of course you do yeah i think you had some of  those i remember that the panacea 70s what do you mean 70s you had one at a.m no no that's the one  that ended up in the ice no no something similar to that oh no mine was a cheaper that's like seven  how big was your portable tv at a.m uh i think it was uh about a five inch something like that no but  how bit you know how deep oh it was pretty deep that's what i'm saying yeah so it was a five inch 
[02:53:00]  screen and it went back maybe ten inches yeah it was pretty stupid that's a great story and leaves  his uh cool portable tv after our radio show and rocco and his gang put it on um ice they they  were stacking everything up in the corner and it was a bus tray with ice cubes in it right and they  just put the the tv on the ice thinking it's another solid thing to just stack it on when the ice melted  i came in the next day my tv was in a bucket of water dummies i know it wasn't done on purpose but 
[02:53:30]  no no it was done out of complete stupidity right uh not really appreciating the fact that  i had one because we didn't have tvs in the studio back then huh yeah right so we needed that tv to  kind of see what the fuck was going on in the world fucking silly then of course they move on to the  disc man i don't know these are guess things that i don't know if we actually miss them no i don't  miss miss a fucking disc man that's for sure but you know when you finally realize holy  fuck i could bring my cds and and leave my house with them yeah i don't have to play them in my car 
[02:54:00]  you need a good buffering on it though i remember the buff protection buffering but you accepted  that because it was so cool yeah one at a time you'd have to put them in and it is amazing how  fucking fast everything is turned like i look at that right now like it's a fucking cave wall drawing  that little portable tv danny's got up right it was pretty cool when it came out absolutely absolutely  it was cool that was your lifeline right there to a ball game or something but the disc man holy 
[02:54:30]  fuck yeah you know i saw something was talking about radio beach and shit people would look at  the radio some i was watching someone talk about radio and they said years ago when you listen to  the radio you'd gather around and look at the radio yeah what the fuck is that about like when nobody  had tv before tv they would all sit around when the game was on and fucking stare at the rate like  like how stupid is that they were dummies they're gonna fall out you yeah you kind of what was that  about stare the why wouldn't you get a nice chair and just close your eyes just a gathering place i guess 
[02:55:00]  yeah i'm talking about uh nostalgic activities that kids today will never experience yeah uh this one's  great hanging out with friends without they are all looking at the radio yes a bunch of dummies  everyone had to force the rate uh face the radio let's look at the radio that's so i got i got a  nice fucking old radio in my house i don't turn it on though it just looks cool it works yeah it does  actually nice like twilight zone i get old stations it's it's as tall as that one it's a different 
[02:55:30]  model than oh do you think here but i like old radios i guess back then when you when you grew up  just with no technology and then all of a sudden magic voices are coming out of a box yes  it's pretty fucking amazing yeah everything's amazing when it first comes out yeah the next  amazing thing amazing we don't even think twice about it some of thomas edison's electricity first  time someone just popped that switch in this and light appeared oh fucking amazing imagine seeing 
[02:56:00]  that for the first time you're like what the fuck the fuck is this menlo park uh the next one hanging  out with friends without any distractions now we all know today it's just like you can barely have a  conversation with anyone there's a very short-lived booking and twittering and very short-lived phase  of when people uh thought it was rude to be out and go on your phone remember that it was like hey  hey hey it was right and then it just like got plowed under any type of a civility or or manners 
[02:56:30]  as far as not using your phone it's completely accepted now it doesn't at one point at our table  at sam's wedding we all were on our phones yeah at one point we were conversing and stuff but  you know there was a very short time though that where people would be like oh god look he's on his  phone yeah it wasn't out we're dinner now it doesn't matter colin got mad at me once years ago maybe  four years ago five years four years ago because he was telling me something that i thought he was  just he was bothered by something but i didn't realize he was bothered by it and uh i was just 
[02:57:00]  fucking with him tell him i shut up and i'm looking at my phone but then he was really pissed  at me oh wow he was telling me something and i was just go on your fucking phone ignore me like oh i  didn't but now he's always on the phone because he wasn't as much of a texter back then yeah and then  of course fucking him and his stupid fucking tweets his his fairy fingers and i mean fairy like mystical  creature fingers now he can't get enough his dumb iphone so his face is always buried in it  but uh now it's you're right it's so much more accepted now than even a few years ago now nobody cares if 
[02:57:30]  you're on your phone no they're not gonna bitch too much about it uh by the way your our pal colin  is uh uh having a birthday today oh is he really oh not a special birthday it's just his birthday  happy birthday happy birthday to colin yeah big deal i say a guy who can't watch his friend happy birthday  because it's not cool happy birthday stupid because it's not cool yeah yeah fuck him fuck that  shit the next one uh wow i remember this feeling the thrill of recording your favorite song  kids today remember you were like whatever it was zeppelin metallica you name it and you would just 
[02:58:00]  you would you would just wait for the radio to play to push fucking record oh my god you would miss the  first couple seconds obviously because you you know you're waiting for the song or sometimes you would  guess and hope that it was the next song i remember there was one time uh i guess a radio station was  like away for like the long july 4th weekend so they were playing like the same three hours of radio over  and over again and like the new green day song that just came out i just sat by my radio with the  tape waiting with like record and play was already down it was just on pause right so all i had to do 
[02:58:30]  is unpause unpause motherfucker that's right we all did that to just you know get our music on a cassette  oh man dual deck do you remember is that when you could record cassette to cassette how cool is that  yeah with your high speed high speed dub high speed dubbing ruled  fucking ruled remember yeah giant boom box and then napster just hit it out of the park  you forget because now we get any song we want but remember when napster first hit you're like wait 
[02:59:00]  what yeah i remember my computer was so shitty i downloaded an mp3 i mean it took 20 minutes and  then my computer couldn't play it the processor wasn't good enough but napster yeah yeah before that  they accepted you you were going to you know record shit off the radio yeah but for some  reason then you know getting a really good copy that was a no-no i forgot about like waiting on  the for the radio to play the song so you could tape it that's fucked up so then you could play  whenever the fuck you wanted yeah you don't have a computer or any of that shit that's the only way 
[02:59:30]  you would get a a song computer why would i need a computer and really how forward thinking with star  trek like you're just talking to computers asking for things and then there it is yeah and that's all we're  doing that's all we're doing really crazy yeah next one um you forget but you used to have to get  up early on saturday morning just to watch cartoons that was the only time they fucking played them as  a kid you would kind of get up early anyway it wasn't like i was hung over back then right uh but  yeah i'd wake up and i was a fucking madman for uh for cartoons i loved cartoons i had to make sure you 
[03:00:00]  got up early to watch you had to get up early and uh i i remember like asking for what some of the  the first memories i have is asking my mom if today was the day the good cartoons are on  what were the good cartoons well that's saturday saturday morning but because i didn't know what  day it was i was a kid i had no concept of days so i just would wake up and go is today the good day  for good cartoons what were your cartoons your go-tos oh my god obviously bugs was great stones was huge 
[03:00:30]  for us yeah uh the jetsons i fucking loved yeah yeah i hated the jetsons and i loved as a kid it was  a look at the future oh okay and what could happen in the future an eager boy looking forward yes i was  also um a big fan of uh underdog and uh tennessee tuxedo and um uh fractured fairy tales yes um yeah that  was like my goat about mcgillia gorilla mcgillia gorilla that was always on that dumb i don't 
[03:01:00]  even know if that one holds up but we watched that one a lot i remember this song how much is that  monkey in the window would you say monkey or gorilla she would say monkey yeah it was gorilla  the mcgillia gorilla show presented by ideal toys oh ideal toys i remember ideal  that company's still around you know what dumb one i like mighty mouse mighty mouse  was great remember mighty mouse yes that was another one i used to watch on that all about 
[03:01:30]  mighty mouse and then it all turned to shit when uh when like noon whirled around and the bowery  boys came on saturday morning uh cartoons were always over when uh uh what was that that disco  show soul train when soul train right yes soul train came on it was like ah that's the end of the  cartoons over what about um now you can just watch cartoons whenever you want obviously the mighty  mouse so the kids won't know that can we hear the mighty mess so i remember i loved mighty mouse  when i was a kid yeah i haven't watched that in probably since thursday mighty mouse 
[03:02:00]  i never watched cartoons as an adult never no no man i love watching cartoons still i dropped off but i  really used to it really used to in my 20s oh yeah  they really put their all into these songs probably the best cartoon song ever this is a good one i can't 
[03:02:30]  listen to this though without thinking andy kaufman's bit what a simple bit but what a great bit he just  fucking stood there for the whole song took balls and then and then did that here i come to see you  have that he was just mouthed the words and moved his arm like that if you've never stood there  put this on our facebook page this was on snl he's standing there yeah just in a suit  like an idiot looking sheepish standing there stoically very meek 
[03:03:00]  now he's mouthing this part and then he just and then he just waits again the people did not know  what the to think he's an old record player next to him i know just waiting waiting  he's trying to sing but it's not time yet he fucked up yeah  his hands moving like big a's he's all nervous goes to sing at the wrong time 
[03:03:30]  what a strange fucking guy kind of brilliant yeah it was funny because it  fucking worked he's still waiting waiting for his part again waiting  he gives it he gives it his all very over dramatic yes i don't know it is funny people either love  this guy or fucking hate him now he's just drinking water waiting yeah i liked a lot of his stuff very 
[03:04:00]  professional very strange but what was he getting very unique  he's getting ready again the funny thing is he's getting his lips wet yeah like he's he tried some  water and there he is again it's just nonsense it was idiotic but ridiculous but i mean that's  fucking what 30 years ago oh maybe more he did that type of alternative stuff before anybody else 
[03:04:30]  and when there was no rooms for it right when it was yeah yeah that fucking catch a rising star it  just annoyed people yeah people were fucking annoyed by that yeah you got to remember all that stuff when  annie kaufman came around no one was doing shit like no one he was no performance artist i mean that  was right right and he was legit he really was that guy he wasn't some fucking he wasn't some unfunny dude  trying to find a way to be in a funny situation by pretending he didn't care about being funny no that was  him he really was that fucking lunatic that's great uh the next thing we're looking at stuff 
[03:05:00]  that kids will just not do nowadays that we did uh triaging your music for vacations what's that  mean well basically we have our phone we go away every song we want to hear is on our phone we have  access to but there was a time you had all your cassettes or or cds yeah and you had to decide which  ones we're going to make the cut right yep remember that remember that oh god can't take 
[03:05:30]  all these cassettes cassettes oh i got the cassette you remember the little it was like a little mini  album cover in your cassette it was so cool i didn't have eight tracks yeah no i i remember my  dad having my older sister had eight tracks it was that a fold up a matchbook and kind of shove it in  the side to keep it from they couldn't figure out how bouncing around in the car i love that they couldn't  figure out how to make one long track it had to be two tracks for one long song yeah was it really  yeah the song actually stopped they didn't have the technology yet and you had to fucking push 
[03:06:00]  you know push the next track to have the song continue in the middle of the song it would fade  out like you'd fucking know the song would fade out and then you'd hear this big mechanical clicking  noise and then it would fade back up again in the middle of the song right because they couldn't  the the way the way the a track worked there was no way to really time it out where there was  nothing there like where the song would end at a certain time it would just thought weird as  fucking it faded out though i thought it i thought it just ended abruptly i remember i'm fading out i 
[03:06:30]  guess they figured all right let's at least fade this part of the song out and then fade it back up in  the next yeah really weird how long was the eight track in in cars for like or how long was the eight  was that kind of like a quick transient one that wasn't that long right it was pretty quick uh i  guess it was during the um early 70s uh maybe even to the the 77 what do you mean the eight track was  quick it was a short life yeah i don't remember it being all that long yeah i remember it but i never 
[03:07:00]  had one and i don't have any memories like it's like the laser disc i i knew it existed but i don't  remember having any i remember having cassettes eventually yeah if my father had an eight track  and we i don't remember it and the trunk was full of just eight tracks laying around melted soaked in  fox head oil or it would have a bubble from sun yeah and you'd say overheated maybe you'd save stuff  when one technology would end to the next one like all right cassettes are over but you'd save them  just in case they came back save that that's got to save that one i still got some of those carts in 
[03:07:30]  my uh closet that's kind of another thing people don't that's like an uh an antique an artifact these  days that fucking metal funnel thing you used to have to slam into the top of the round oil cans  when you had to put oil in your car like no one uses those anymore it's all plastic  about about screw them off and it would spill all over the fucking valve cover and smoke all over the  car i forgot all about that those things sucked they always leaked do we have a date on that 
[03:08:00]  daddy or no is it uh not like a hard date but it said by the late 70s they were beginning to  be phased out when did they start uh in cars or just as a yeah both generally i'm just curious i  have no memory i bet you the technology started i remember 60s but early 70s is when everyone really  started getting it i would guess my dad had one in 72 so by 1980 they're probably gone oh yeah they were  done by i think 77 around there is pretty much over cassettes around then yeah cassettes were known  for just recording audio they didn't really think of them as a music thing 66 was when they became 
[03:08:30]  commercially successful okay so people play them in their house and stuff on their groovy new stereo  groovy buck stereos we could buck super stereo world the last few we could go is it fair we could go  through quickly because we've done this uh remembering phone numbers kids today obviously  don't have to remember phone numbers you literally had to memorize you don't have to memorize anything  it was in your head all your friends phone numbers your phone number everything in your head 
[03:09:00]  this one we never talked about hoping your nearest movie theater got the movie you wanted to see  holy no multiplex motherfucker no multiplex no one theater if it was animal house or  trying to think of the movies from the late 70s early 80s you had sometimes you had to  fucking travel you had to wait or as a 17 18 year old you're like holy fuck we're traveling  yeah i had to go see this movie what women mall was the big uh place to go for the movies but it was  one or two theaters back then yeah it was like two i think maybe two and there were the uh the elwood 
[03:09:30]  cinemas on jericho turnpike right one for me until the comac multiplex came up before it turned into uh  pretty much a gang killing land they've been good lately right have they i haven't been there in  fucking centuries i haven't heard uh any stories lately yeah it was pretty scary there for a while  oh yeah uh checking box scores in the morning box that's how you got your fucking uh yeah you know  to see if your team won or not you couldn't check your espn app or anything like that no you had to 
[03:10:00]  wait and then finally not having access uh to everything ever that's on the end of the list  everything ever is right there at your fingertips that's pretty much the way it is you would have to  go to a library or find someone that was knowledgeable on a subject you didn't know  shit right i just remember like seeing somebody on tv and toiling over where did i see that person  they were in a movie i think and then it just for hours would annoy you and just 
[03:10:30]  fucking pound in your head or that's why you just oh imdb that's why the encyclopedias were huge  yeah you know but giant encyclopedias but tv would choose what what they were going to teach you  yeah if it was some cool like i don't know we didn't really have documentaries during that  shit if you think channel 13 a little bit yes you you would get some shit like that but uh not a lot  though yeah and then the encyclopedias like within two years were dated they were back then like  borders were moving uh in in uh southeast asia and uh in europe and and you just it's just what 
[03:11:00]  it was do you think encyclopedias are a good investment now like to invest in an encyclopedia  company and someone going door to door can i start knocking your face say encyclopedia  haven't killed encyclopedia britannica just uh stopped their um paper printing that was it  they finally said when they just just like this year stopped uh really what tipped them off that  they sold four encyclopedias worldwide who buys them yeah no google by the way whoever those surge 
[03:11:30]  and the other guy who did google is an amazing fucking invention i guess it's all part of ask  jeeves or or an extension of that whatever the fuck but google is a genius invention man it really is  just a a wonder of man whatever's next is gonna be even better well it's gonna be facebook obviously  oh yeah yeah i didn't know what was next so i just kind of said it'll be better i ran out of steam on  that one oh whatever's next will be better it's gonna get worse somehow yeah exactly like you'll 
[03:12:00]  enter something in google and a big question mark will come up on your screen we don't know either i have  no idea but what is the next step it's like maybe it'll just be because they they theorized uh that we like  when you just think of something you'll know it yeah because your brain will automatically google  it uh once we once we can think and move computers yeah a more organic interface i think google glasses  yeah google glasses yeah whatever happened where's the google glasses they're still working on the 
[03:12:30]  contacts and stuff maybe not google but kaku did a great lecture i didn't i watched it was an hour  lecture i watched 25 minutes of and uh he was talking about those contact lenses where uh right  everything's just in front of you that's amazing but my thing is how do you stop and this is they'll  figure this out when you're thinking to make your computer do something how do you stop all the  random crazy thoughts oh boy that to come in just watch shit popping up on the fucking uh jim's  computer screen yeah you're having it like the films they were showing fucking alex and uh yeah 
[03:13:00]  in uh clockwork you were at work presenting something and all of a sudden just the words fart juice pops up on  the fucking window i don't know why i'm thinking that fart juice i don't know  that'll be scary at first but then people in general will think ah it's no big deal  that everyone's thinking weird right i don't know about that it'd be weird at first though yeah  taking your girl to the drive-in yeah man i would like to go to a drive-in there's still a couple  i kind of like the drive-in thing there is one um upstate new york i think there is a couple of 
[03:13:30]  more around they're very rare i really want to go i've saw one kenny will remember where it was  oh but it was out of season when i was doing a gig there but i do want to go to a drive-in movie  yeah yes i just hated the sound it's like  remember how cool it was to see a movie outside it was cool as a kid i used to go to my pajamas yeah  yeah a little pillow or go on your sleeping bag and then lay out in front of the car you have to 
[03:14:00]  sit there in the back seat uh no we the parents are in the front seat and uh and uh uh you have  to like deal with dad farting and uh you know well maybe mom and dad arguing when everyone went  outside and there were two maybe three spots on the windshield that were cool because you could kind  of like yeah yeah you used to like lay out on the hood of the car everyone else was uncomfortable  and on the roof you'd put a blanket on like the roof of the fucking car that's sure i forgot about 
[03:14:30]  that shit i'd do that tomorrow that fucking shit i remember i was trying to get my dad my dad took me  to see some movie at the drive-in i don't remember what but the sensuous nurse was the late movie with  ursula andrus or the sensual nurse i was trying to get him to stay and watch that but he just wouldn't  probably want to get a rod in the car with this 12 year old i did man i fucking that stupid goddamn  barbarella movie was playing uh out in california when i was out there my father decides to have me go  that was porno back and i was sitting in the middle between him and his wife cory her girlfriend 
[03:15:00]  at the time yeah and and i don't think he knew what the fuck it was all about and and the opening  sequence jane fond is pretty much naked but it's like in almost silhouette but a little more than  just silhouette and she's floating in space but she's like fucking naked and i swear to god i was like  starting to breathe heavy i couldn't fucking deal i had a hard on i'm like i'm sitting with next to my  dad it was it was fucking embarrassing there were many years you just couldn't control that you couldn't  control now you could kind of like get your shit together i was like and then i remember i remember 
[03:15:30]  the fucking windshield was steamed up on the inside and that was all and my dad like rolled the window  down to try to fuck it that was because you were oh your young body was heating up i couldn't take it  i think that's when he decided it was time to get buzzed time to get buzzed to fucking deal with it  poison out of my son yeah oh man wow you know get buzzed quick lest i go to a man  and become a faggot like he said  yeah amazing yeah there's drive-ins remember and then it was kind of cool you get to go to this 
[03:16:00]  you know the snack stand felt like you're on a little adventure oh yeah you're trying to find your  way back to the car crunching on that gravel dumb shit yeah but what um it was always too bright  remember yeah your eyes are just so you get your dumb popcorn where would you go for this would  there be a break in the movie well they did a lot of double features and shit and little shorts

[03:19:30]  here whether you want to hear it or not here it is this is the worst of the opian anthony show on  serious xm i always prefer a skirt to go up really yeah much more than pants to come down i like a skirt  to go hiked up a little bit you open the legs open and you feel up the skirt oh that's the best this is  the constant battle of naked or semi-naked i prefer um i don't mind naked but i like i like the uh 
[03:20:00]  the skirt to get hiked up i like to go in that way i don't like to have them just pull the skirt off  i like a nice short skirt um you talking about trannies again oh yeah something where the balls  are hanging down underneath the m the m line just admit i like that too just naked as opposed to  clothes yeah anthony just likes i like when you could just pull it we were talking about like  that when you that first time when when you first start out your sexual career when when uh you hook 
[03:20:30]  your fingers at on the panties or the skirt or pants or something and she lifts her ass up to  let you know you could pull down and it's just like oh that's that moment is like yes but i like  the skirt going on more than that i prefer the legs opening and the skirt hiking like i like to see  the pussy that way for the there's nothing better than a skirt with no panties i don't know nothing  better i mean it's great don't get me wrong but i kind of like when all of it's off and you get a good  view of the whole thing just to know that like all night long at the restaurant at the club 
[03:21:00]  all your fucking comic friends have probably seen your chick's pussy like nine times not my wife but  my chick is that good though i don't know it's kind of hot just to know that she has no panties on  jesus i like that too i was out with a woman once and she had god she had a fat  pussy it was it was a massive and she was showing me under the table oh i was out of my it's one of  those things that's been burned in my brain and will be there until i die that's a pretty uh cool 
[03:21:30]  view right awesome awesome welcome aboard welcome aboard under the skirt yeah right in right in get  right in right through the right through those lips but like i was trying to snap pictures of it and when  i saw it like just fucking rest it was so big and fucking obscenely dirty that she was doing that i  was fucking it's one of those things that makes me weak to think about wow yeah that skirt with no  fucking panties on man oh the whole mindset is behind the fact that you kind of like that thing 
[03:22:00]  and i like fucking just everything off um like everything off i like being able to look at you know  like a pilot coming into the landing you want to see the whole runway i like looking at everything from  from that vantage point you know i think it means you're more normal sexually in a weird way because  like i fetishize it like uh you just like a naked chick that you want to just jam your  fucking giant italian concho peep dick into i i i like something naughty about it or something  inappropriate i would rather be like and i don't know if it's so yeah you know i like tights like 
[03:22:30]  black tights really on abroad yeah there's something about black tights that really  if a girl has a dress on with those black tights and then yeah you can pull the just the ass down  a little bit so you can see the pussy yeah oh something like she's kind of tied up she can't  move a little bit she can't walk right oh boy you know what i mean are you like the hobbler 
[03:23:00]  i'm not a i'm not a stockings or tights or like pantyhose certain stockings can look really good i like a  good uh fishnet if it you know if it's appropriate right something though up to mid mid thigh is good  i don't like something like pantyhose i don't want something with a firming panel on the front  if a girl was anything with a panel in it i don't want it what dom de louise used to wear  the you know the thigh high socks those are fucking i remember a girl she had dr seuss thigh

[03:33:00]  just stop really don't i i used to i used to fake it though because i thought oh if you stop them  they wouldn't suck your dick you know what i mean they suck on your nipple because they want to be  sexy because they want to reenact some fucking love scene they saw in a fucking movie so you let  them suck your tit for 10 minutes yeah the perception of hotness and it doesn't really  translate nothing i love that stop watching i need it yeah fuck yeah man you need it you need it  there's something hardwired between your nipples and your fucking dick i've done too much damage man 
[03:33:30]  do you think that's what it is not coming home too much damage can't click your heels i can't get  back man oh man i'm i'm fucking i'm fucking walking in the deer hunter healthy sexuality is like  de niro came looking for me and i just yeah it's snubbed i'm in a fucking basement surrounded by  guys with a fucking rag on my head he's got a cock to his head going mouth mouth days are gone  yeah man you don't think you can come back at all i have to i would have to lay off my body for 
[03:34:00]  probably a month or maybe 90 days or something i would have to lay off really and let my body come  back yeah it's fucking shot i stopped watching porn you know because i'm trying to have a baby  and i couldn't it's working oh no just kidding just pointed at bobby's  fuck i hate chip i know so what it's because you can't um you got to be ready to go you can't just  that i can i'm one and done i can't i can't yeah especially with my wife oh no i'm kidding no really 
[03:34:30]  i mean you get so desensitized to each other because i told her we stopped walking around naked  together we stopped we had to stop doing certain things was that her suggestion  here's a sweater i really don't i really don't know what she's i i think she's lying oh to herself  yeah you know what i mean like i'm like i don't get what you get girls are weird like that they can  just fucking love love uh people love us why me oh because my instant dawn yeah she shouldn't 
[03:35:00]  fucking like me nobody should but yeah no she's uh she looks really good and yeah you're a bit of a  disaster lately but uh that's how that's what women do but but you know but stop and jerking off i  haven't watched porn you stop watching porn for a little bit and the first couple times in you're like  ugh and then it quickly starts to unravel and go away and you're right really fast back to where 
[03:35:30]  you were three weeks ago looking at some hard shit more hard trying to find just somebody with a mask  and a gun and a girl really crying something that works for you sure but the first couple you're like  fuck you know you it's like uh it's like when that first cigarette after you quit smoking for a long  time it just tastes like shit but you know where that's headed yeah but if you keep going yeah it  goes away and all of a sudden it just tastes awesome but when you when you quit porn and you go to have 
[03:36:00]  sex like or be sexual how long does it take to adjust because i don't i wouldn't know if i wasn't playing  with my nipples because i i literally would jerk off and just fucking tweet on my nipple with my left thumb  it's fucking awful really yeah it's like a zone out ritual so weird that's weird yeah i i well sex was really  good uh after i eat because you haven't had it it's like uh not eating salt not having salt in your  diet right and then and that's what comes in your mouth you would you would but then when you have 
[03:36:30]  when when you have like fruit when you take sugars and stuff and then you have fruit and you haven't  eaten and all of a sudden fruit is like fucking ice cream right it's like holy shit they're great it's  the same thing with uh fucking your girl i guess so you realize what a mindset thing it is when you  think all right just the pure physical feeling of a chick shoving her hands down the front of your 
[03:37:00]  pants grabbing your dick if it's your chick that you've been with for a long time it doesn't feel  the same but it's it is the same thing it's just a hand grabbing same same nerve endings are being  stimulated but if it's some let's say some girl you just fucking met in a bar that night it feels  different feels there's nothing the physical part of it feels different though based on just what's in  your head so the first time a girl that you don't know grabs your cock if they there's no i don't  know if there's a better feeling in the world that i've ever felt you're looking around like for the

[03:51:00]  kid's a civilian but uh he's a really really happy kid he doesn't have he doesn't have anger issues  like me and all that bullshit i could tell already so i'm like oh i get it what what i have was  environmental it wasn't in my dna oh so you think it was that whole nature nurture thing so yours was  nurture i've been in or lack thereof yeah i've been around enough kids with my nephews and nieces  you know exactly what their personality is within within a few weeks of their life i mean in general 
[03:51:30]  you know what kind of kid he's going to be going to be drooling and shitting himself his whole life  and my kid doesn't show any signs of that bullshit just a happy kid that likes to laugh  and smile and stuff and he's been in a really good mood the last few days but it was uh time for  the doctor yesterday and they checked his weight and his height and everything's great and blah blah  blah and then like all right it's time for the shots and the cute little pediatrician leaves the  room i mean a cute little thing you know yeah and then there's boom boom boom boom this 
[03:52:00]  fucking monster comes in the in the room which makes it even worse if they do that on purpose so  the kid won't have this like thing against the pediatrician yeah herself yeah yeah she's a monster  with uh she has chin hair oh beautiful and mars like a lunch lady yeah i don't know you look like  a big lunch lady all you have to do is cut that shit you don't even have to shave that  shit just cut it down women with chin hair ever look in the mirror i don't know man this it was cut  that shit there were there couldn't have been more than five strands but they were long i'm like what 
[03:52:30]  do you just cut that shit there women with chin hair are all former rape victims and they're trying  to discourage any man from wanting to fuck them again is that it and it works it's viable oh god and she lays  down the uh she lays down the needles three of them for for my uh my little son there and he's happy  and he's cooing he now coos and he's moving his arms on his legs uh oh everyone's saying he looks like  a uh like a gerber baby oh he is a cute kid because you know my wife's pretty good looking didn't get 
[03:53:00]  it for me that looks like eddie vetter with the chin hair there that is a woman oh it looks like deal  jesus wow yeah it does a little bit right that couldn't be real so uh oh wants to back op up  getting the first shot sucks it's the welcome to life though like and said so so he's couldn't be  happier couldn't be happier and they're like well just want to warn you that the kid is gonna scream  that there's no doubt about that but some kids decide they need to hold their breath really oh yeah 
[03:53:30]  they do that yeah because i asked the chin lady i'm like so what's gonna happen here oh he's gonna  cry it's gonna be bad not by the hairs of my chinny chin there's no doubt about it this is not good  like you like to hear like well some kids cry some kids some don't some never even notice she goes no  no a hundred percent this is not a good scene and i'm thinking to myself it's the year 2010 they can't  figure this out some kind of star trek thing where they just go something something yeah i'm not a  doctor but you would think after all these years they could figure something out still a 
[03:54:00]  metal tube that they stick in you and inject fluid through it so uh so uh she hits him with the shots  i'll i'll fast forward this this story right into his fat fucking thighs and the kid turns beet red  holds his breath and just loses his mind so then my my wife loses her mind i grabbed the kid to try to  calm him down so now he thinks i'm the evil one because yeah because i was the one that he saw first  after this horrible pain and and uh whatever i mean now you're freaking out oh yeah oh jesus yeah 
[03:54:30]  you know her she's oh no so he's just losing his fucking mind beet red screaming bloody murder and  just like you said welcome to life for your first little he didn't have any of this ship before  yesterday it was nothing but presents and colorful things and mobiles and shook a shook is under the  chin and yeah a little pat on the head is this shot like that or all they just do all three real  quick she tried to go quick but each shot was just the hell on earth for this damn little thing 
[03:55:00]  and then uh i sort of calmed him down and then he was uh pretty much miserable all day yesterday  and you just feel like like like shit really you feel like shit okay like this is yeah i brought you  into this lovely world and here's your here's your first shot of holy shit life sucks it is  right there'll be plenty more of this before you die of old age yeah the whole life is just full of 
[03:55:30]  these this is every relationship you'll ever be in every job you'll ever have right it's just everything  this is your car breaking down this is but the first seven or eight weeks of uh of your life is you  know i finally figured out that's what they say when you have a kid you relive your life basically  so obviously we went through the the shot thing way back in the day as we all say of course and you  know the first seven or eight weeks was gravy fucking great but this is what life is really 
[03:56:00]  about this shit kids don't get that inoculation thing anymore huh right in the arm where we know  where they well that's where i think 68 wasn't that the last year they have the one with the scar  yeah that's where you show your age if you want to not much that's like every kid was marked  yeah yeah i have that yeah yeah you guys got a little one too those those shots were done in  school weren't they i don't even know i remember lining up in school to get the  bullshit shots where everyone was like the gun yeah it was that gun they put it up to your 
[03:56:30]  arm and went like oh yeah is that what the scar is yeah it's just like would push the fluid right  into your is that polio i don't know is that the polio one i don't know i remember pox i remember  someone saying pat from unaki saying small pox yeah small cox but remember uh you got word that  it's gonna be shot day and then yeah and in our school system which was harvard fields uh well  harvard fields high school washington drive i'll go real local in centerport they lined everyone buddy 
[03:57:00]  up in the gym and you line up good boy johnny and you saw every you saw everybody crying there  wasn't one that escaped crying from that shot it was just a miserable day for everybody it was a gun  and then they like screw some fricking uh little thing on top of it and then yeah you get it on your  arm like a star trek kind of kind of thing and then boom and and yeah it left a scarf for the rest of  your life you just like fucking marked the children i bet there's a conspiracy theory about that oh i'm 
[03:57:30]  sure yeah so it was uh it was one of those sad days yesterday you know yeah then the kid was just  whining and crying not whining just like like what the hell was that man fuck no more of that please  but then by the time i left this morning he seems like he's uh he's he's back to snapping back he's  snapping back pretty quickly which is good one bad memory now there you go you got one count them  keep going that's the first set of shots i think i think you just gotta do another oh yeah there's 
[03:58:00]  more yeah they warned uh warned us said well the next visit in a month will just be a checkup but then  then we're going back to this horror show wow i didn't think i thought they did it all in one shot  or something and you talked to doctors and stuff and they said the kid won't even remember that memory  and stuff but come on somewhere deep in your dna all that shit builds up i'm thinking yeah right they  say other shit like that kids do remember when they supposedly don't remember anything why not the  you know shopping they say your whole personality is formed before you're two like whatever's gonna 
[03:58:30]  make you like the different stuff comes after but you you have your basic core by the time you're two  so you remember everything that was the pediatrician white yeah yeah is now but who who gave the shot  this is a very very black or white no she was a monster white woman oh yeah i figured they said  the black nurse and it's a whole racial thing yeah i guess it starts as disliking each other very  young i guess i'm trying to remember what mine was you know my my kid's gonna hate fat chicks like  his father because and chin hair fucking chin hair god damn man get rid of that stuff and then i'm 
[03:59:00]  looking at her thinking i don't trust you i i think you would smother a kid oh she looked like one of  those i'm having these thoughts as as she comes in with the needles yeah like misery yeah that woman  yeah yeah exactly was she a treat kathy bates kathy bates and misery who turned a little scrapbook  she turned 60 yesterday did she yeah get to that yesterday but she uh the big 6-0 for kathy that  doesn't seem so fucked up because she's always just looked old and frumpy mm-hmm yeah because 
[03:59:30]  misery has to be at least mr man 95 98 i'm gonna go yeah okay i was gonna say definitely over 10 years  ago i think it's even i think it's probably older than that perhaps older than that in 95 that's  misery was 1990 yeah 90 20 years ago that was a long time ago she was 40 in that i love that movie  i don't know why but that was it oh it's a great one that was one of the james conden is so good in  that yeah i saw that in the movie theater yeah the whole and i mean i i think people have seen it 
[04:00:00]  already at the end when she comes you know for that final yeah come back the whole movie theater  jump like i felt the earth actually move itself like three feet back fantastic when he smashes  her head with the typewriter yeah her big fat dumb head oh that was great oh it's fantastic you're  ruining the movie man oh i know never got out of the cock-a-doodie car yeah just weird wow was  she enraging in that movie yeah yeah her mr man mr man like when she comes down with the gun all 
[04:00:30]  fucking mellowed out i don't know yeah i'll just come down here yeah like uh you're a little  weird or she noticed her penguin was facing the wrong way great movie absolutely that's one good  but if it's on i'll i'll watch it uh so yesterday was a weird fucking day for the poor kid yeah a  little tater tot let's go to ed in jersey ed hello ed hey hope you gotta take a uh infant cpr or choking 
[04:01:00]  course because i have a one-year-old and she had a breath holding incident like four months ago i  pulled an alarm clock away from her and she spun away from me and she was crying and then she stopped  crying and walked away fell forward and passed out and when i flipped her over she was blue so i thought  she was choking on something or whatever so i you know i i'm a police officer so i gave her rescue  breaths all right you know we had 911 cup and all that stuff we took her to the doctors and they said  that she held her breath so long that she couldn't regain it actually passed out oh that's great oh 
[04:01:30]  yeah and and then my three-year-old about a year and a half ago she was choking on a part of a soft  pretzel and i flipped her over pointed her down and gave her back blows and dislodged it but you know  this is stuff that you never ever expect you know so you really should take one of them what about  let me ask you hold in the breath things okay he's like you know i've made the right decision  i'd rather just hold the head of a puking hungover girl right same thing you don't know if they're 
[04:02:00]  going to survive yeah it was weird she had vomit all over i was wiping her down and well the church  she was going to make it to morning had to hold her hair back it was horrible terrible scene at my  house pounder on the back with a cleanest because my cum was all over what is the holding the breath  thing is that is that a lesson the kid learns like as a way to make the parents panic what is  the holding the breath they said she does it like she's done it a couple times we just did it last 
[04:02:30]  week but she didn't pass out she she at the last second she takes the breath so now she's like you  know one year and four months but um the doctor said they can't die from it but i didn't know i  she just went out cold unconscious and turned like blue your body actually passes out and then  they kick into overdrive but it's like what's in their mind like are they doing this to like i'll  show him or not on purpose they hold their breath they're so pissed and then they like panic it's  almost like a little like panic attack because then they can't regain their breath and then they 
[04:03:00]  get yeah i think it's because i know in cards i think it's a panic thing in cartoons when i was  growing up they'd always show like the little kid when when it was mad it would fold its arms and go  and hold it turn all kinds of color breathe finsta breathe maybe that is to freak out bunny  and have to like smack baby finsta to uh clarify it for us a little bit more really dr steve you  think he's up this early oh no oh yeah hold his breath well they'll do that every so often 
[04:03:30]  i asked the doctor i said is it possible because you know i actually cleared her throat thinking there  was something locked in there did the finger sweep but i asked the doctor i said is it possible that  she held her breath for so long that she passed out and he said absolutely he said it's you know  it's pretty common so it's just something once they get a little bit older that can actually happen  christ doesn't happen well i'm sorry they don't die from it you know instead of having a uh a really  nice fucking smartphone for everybody how about we figure out the shots for the kids i'd rather have a 
[04:04:00]  smartphone i know how about a smartphone that gives shots yeah smartphone that gives shots now you're  talking well you give the kid a phone after he gets his shots yeah this is nice right now you're talking  yeah i'll go i'll go get the brand new iphone if it if it's you know can do the shot thing properly  yeah so did you take any kind of cpr yeah yeah we know all that all right i appreciate that know all  that tough guy uh fly fishing yeah yeah that'll happen i haven't left my house in eight weeks what 
[04:04:30]  are you what are you what are you high go fly fishing with this guy sounds like every everyone that's  around him starts choking for some reason yeah hey you want a pretzel this guy's the angel of death he  hurts people and then saves them how about you offer a food that's not dry to your guests  yeah on the job i'm about over 25 on cpr calls no lie what do you mean over 25 i've never had a  shave and i've done about 25 different times i've done cpr jesus you stink you know what are you getting 
[04:05:00]  there the next day you haven't saved one person with your skills never never they're always i've had  the defibrillator on within a you know a minute or two uh you know different but no i'm telling it  it doesn't really work for adults when they have when they go with the cardiac and stuff wow all  right well uh i was gonna i don't know what to say there yeah you might be you might be the angel of  death hopefully you'll uh yeah anybody that does that i mean i think it's like it's like like five 
[04:05:30]  or six percent of the time you'll actually get an actual save out of a real cpr save all right but  sometimes we're still talking like a car yeah yeah i agree i'm gonna start holding my breath  so you stop talking sir all right thank you we gotta give someone else a shot in wisconsin cody  hey what up my my daughter does that she'll cry she'll hold her breath her eyes literally  will roll in her back of her head her arms dipping right out it looks like she's knocked

[04:07:30]  right i think every single one of us yep got got that that phone call where we got hit in the  head with a hockey stick a broken arm something we uh i was listening to uh ron and fez uh right  here on this very channel at 11 a.m and uh they had a good subject they were bringing up uh  the point that you don't see a lot of kids walking around with casts anymore and i found that like  very interesting it's like yeah what the fuck is that all about like they used to you used to walk 
[04:08:00]  around and constantly you'd see kids in fucking arm casts and they play safe and that's what that's  what uh was brought up with the fact that they're playing video games now they're doing and and there's  not a lot of just kids riding their bikes far like we used to you know go out and ride your bike a few  miles and now you know the parents are so paranoid of abduction and other bullshit what that they they  they're just playing fucking xbox it comes down to this kids don't play unsupervised anymore yeah it's 
[04:08:30]  all about play dates supervised and i guess like the playgrounds are a little more safe with some  cushioning and shit we have monkey bars that if you fell through it was like you were a pachinko ball  just bouncing off a fucking metal i remember my sister who was about six years older than me  so she was uh she had to be about 16 or 17 and we had like a we had like a penny saver route it  wasn't even a paper route and i was 10 maybe and we took off on our bikes for eight and and she 
[04:09:00]  couldn't get a route near the house it was like 10 miles away from the house so my dad would just drop  us off with one bike and all these penny savers she would do the penny saver route and then we would  have to drive drive our bike one bike home 10 miles i was 10 years old 10 miles that no one  cared about kids back then right get out get out of the house and play they just assumed you would be  all right it's it's evil out there i just want to stay inside did i ever tell you the story of my  sister panicking on the way home that of the 10 mile ride after all these years did i ever tell that 
[04:09:30]  story where my sister i should have been driving the bike because she's a panicky pete and it was and it's  a and it's a hill wait was it one bike with two of you on it yes i always hated that because we  were fucking poor how many times i have to tell you did someone have to sit on the seat and someone had  to stand or was it on the handlebars this is so long ago i think we just kind of shared the seat or  side saddle on the metal bar between the seat and handle right that was always the bad one no this was  just a basic bike it didn't have any pegs or any of that shit so i had to sit kind of maybe it was a 
[04:10:00]  longer seat or something i don't remember exactly banana seat did i have a banana banana seat and so  there was a little hill that we had to go down and my sister panicky pete just fucking shaking  side to side so i go flying off the bike rip up my knee to this day it's still scarred right yeah we  had to like uh limp to the nearest house and they had to call uh somebody to bring me to the hospital  get stitched up blah blah blah so year after year when we passed this hill we always take a look 
[04:10:30]  and the older i got i went you mother fucker this was no fucking hill whatsoever the shallower the  hill guy yes yeah my first memory you're thinking it's suicide hill a double black diamond for the  skiers out there and by the time you got you know old enough you realize it was just a simple tiny  little you know decline and she panicked on me nothing worse than having to ride someone on your bike  though i hated that because you would you'd have to stand up while they sat on the seat 
[04:11:00]  and it wasn't like a motorcycle with a nice roomy seat and pegs and shit like that right so  they're constantly their legs are out because then you always hear i heard the horror stories and saw  it of the kid that got his foot caught in the spokes that was like that happens all of us shoot up the  foot and then the uh usually the sneaker would protect you though yeah but uh sometimes barefoot  i saw one once it was just horror a girl she lose a toe no but it was so shoot it was like 
[04:11:30]  fucking the skin was ripped off the the muscle of of her foot muscle and and she was just i remember  walking home screaming crying and limping with just blood it was like a war zone growing up it was like  the vietnam war you just look and go ah yeah she took one in the foot yeah and then there was uh if  your if your uh ankle your your pant leg got caught in the sprocket under the chain because you didn't have  a chain guard because they weren't cool and uh that could suck your uh suck your fucking calf muscle 
[04:12:00]  in that happens well i didn't get my calf muscle uh ripped off but uh remember back like in like  the early 90s when pipe leg jeans were like the coolest thing ever i was racing my friend on my bike  and my bike didn't have a chain guard and it was probably just at the peak of the fastest i could  possibly be riding a bike my pant leg got caught in the chain and then your foot goes around and the  pedal hits the back of your leg yep and then now it's caught in there it's really fucked up it hurts 
[04:12:30]  i did a few flips it was like an indiana jones movie where he just takes the you know the stick  right through the spokes yeah and you know the bike just goes three times tumbling over that was another  thing when somebody was on your handlebars they could get it caught in the front spokes or it was  very hard to steer you could get that wobble factor or they could just fall off and you would run  them over they'd fall off your handlebars and you'd run them over or flip over very dangerous bike  riding back then you don't you again you don't see that either so this day i i tuck my uh my pants 
[04:13:00]  leg in my fucking socks there yeah you wrap around right it in the right one i tuck in i don't trust  even the newer bikes uh old school my friend can't happen when you're driving  well now they got the pegs now yeah they got pegs yeah of course they got pegs well and you know  what you start a fine topic and it does come down to the fact that kids just don't play unsupervised  anymore unsupervised or as like i don't think they play as crazy and on shit that was just not  fucking safe remember the just the metal fucking monkey bars yeah the playgrounds were all grounds were 
[04:13:30]  just all fucking metal many ways to kill yourself the slide was like a fucking razor blade and and  there were kids that got like third degree burns on that metal slide that was sitting out in the sun  like a frying pan and then a kid in shorts would get up there oh remember the burn on the back of your  legs burn the back of your fucking leg kid wouldn't budge it would be going yeah and then just stop there 
[04:14:00]  on a fucking frying pan you ever see ball bag guy ball bag guy dan you've seen ball bag guy right  he went down a slide that had no water oh a water slide water slide with no water supposedly i'm sure  maybe it happened some other way and and uh the skin on his ball bags underneath completely gone  oh yeah that's um someone fucking tweeted i i didn't even think we would bring it to air and all  of a sudden we are now fuck that's when you put the water yeah those slides that have the little 
[04:14:30]  water jets on them and sometimes they clog up and i don't know if the water would come out when they  slide into the pool this guy and you get that yeah this guy lost his skin under his ball bag because  i guess somehow he continued down the slide unless it happened some other way and this guy's trying to  come on himself fucking naked girls right there too oh yeah jesus let's say hi to steve in connecticut  steve everything's naked hey op how you guys doing hi steve yes i want to say  fuck you to spectro i don't wear biking shorts we try to get him too bulging biking yeah i don't
