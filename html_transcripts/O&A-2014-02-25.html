<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them and employing frequent vulgarity and sexually explicit humor.  The show began with a discussion about the performative nature of public apologies, using Alec Baldwin's defiance of expected contrition as a positive example.  This segued into critiques of Ted Nugent's and Ann Coulter's refusal to apologize for controversial statements, contrasting their actions with the pressures faced by others in the media.  The hosts also shared their anxieties about social media posts and potential backlash.  This was followed by a scathing, vulgar tirade against New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's traffic safety initiatives, which the hosts perceived as a revenue-generating scheme.

The hosts then dissected the fallout from the end of the "Scott and Todd" radio show, focusing on Scott Shannon's move to WCBS-FM and the ensuing "jocktober."  They detailed the new show's lineup and reacted with amusement to sexually explicit user-generated content online related to the show's end.  An extensive interview with a caller, Larry, who held strongly conservative and religiously based anti-gay views, followed.  This sparked a contentious but seemingly respectful discussion about religious freedom, social issues, and the role of religion in public life, with the hosts interjecting sarcastic comments.  Other topics briefly touched upon included Michael Sam's NFL combine performance and the media's focus on his sexuality, Robin Thicke's wife's appearance on the show, a clip of Rob Ford's near-collision with a fire hydrant, and a clip of Ted Nugent's CNN interview.  Throughout this section, the hosts and callers frequently used profanity and sexually explicit jokes.

A subsequent segment delved deeper into Ted Nugent's CNN interview with Erin Burnett, analyzing his use of the word "mongrel," his defense of it, and Burnett's attempts to challenge him.  The conversation expanded to other offensive statements made by Nugent, including insults directed at Hillary Clinton.  A caller highlighted a similar use of "mongrel" by President Obama, leading to a discussion about double standards in acceptable language.  Nugent's apology on the show was played and analyzed, alongside a poorly received video clip from a recent Asia performance.  A caller brought up a U2 song's similarity to an older Aslan song.  The segment concluded with a discussion of Hulk Hogan's return to the WWE, featuring a video clip of his appearance.  Sam Roberts provided musical interludes during this segment.  Profanity and offensive language were prevalent throughout.

The show then shifted to the launch of the WWE Network and an interview with Robert Rodriguez.  The hosts mocked a Hulk Hogan appearance, followed by a discussion of the WWE Network's content, including the handling of Chris Benoit's inclusion due to his past actions. Humorous tangents about other wrestlers were also included.  Robert Rodriguez was interviewed about the creation of El Rey Network, its programming (including *From Dusk Till Dawn*), distribution, and his creative process.  The conversation touched on his collaborations with Quentin Tarantino and his filmmaking style. The interview concluded with a discussion of the *From Dusk Till Dawn* series.  The hosts then transitioned to a humorous bit about blenders, featuring a fictional blender salesman and his "Shred Emulsifier" blender.

The final segment began with commentary on Piers Morgan's departure from CNN and speculation about his replacement. This transitioned to a discussion of Harold Ramis's death, followed by a darkly humorous anecdote about a co-worker, Fez, and his emotional reaction to a death anniversary.  Ron Bennington was a guest in studio, and his attire was described.  The conversation then became explicitly sexual, with the hosts and Bennington detailing their pornography viewing habits, preferred devices, and specific websites (including "Clitty.com" and "Xtube").  They also discussed the advertising models used by pornographic websites.  Bennington mentioned upcoming appearances, including a show with Robert Rodriguez and an attempt to "save" a marriage. The hosts also discussed NutriBullets.  The segment concluded with promotional announcements and mention of a post-show segment with Sam Roberts.  Throughout the entire show, the hosts and guests frequently used profanity and sexually explicit language.

[00:01:30]  biggest fucking joke in this country yes everyone no one needs an apology no but the news is pushing  this apology agenda forward it's the whole country is in this apology mode it's ridiculous  every day someone's apologizing for something someone's either apologizing or or they're being  like forced into it they're being asked to apologize why haven't we gotten an apology  oh it makes it nothing it's not good enough right alan ballin blasted over his non-apology 
[00:02:00]  apology was was backhanded backhanded apology right we like groveling good for alec baldwin not  really apologizing yes i've never liked alec baldwin more than i do right now yep that he's finally  woken up to the fucking horrible press what they're all about it's uh it's it's an embarrassment it's all  bullshit man it's bullshit they turned on him too because he was a very loyal liberal guy for all those  causes and he used the wrong language and those cocksuckers turned on him and fucking attacked

[00:03:00]  long 30 rock was on yeah that's true it's the truth yeah 30 rocks over guess what tracy morgan's  knocking on our door again really yeah we ain't playing that game anymore i like tracy too i have  nothing but uh good things to say about the guy we've hung out a lot over the years but that's that's  some bullshit tracy's all about tracy it couldn't come in once during his 30 rock years oh but boy  now that that's over he came a knocking and we said well maybe next time i've got a couple of dates i've 
[00:03:30]  got a right do you judah freelander came in all through 30 rocks absolutely now it's over we don't  want him yeah fuck you now he doesn't have any heat so what ted nugent said mongrel and uh that's a  that's a problem i guess that's a problem yeah i dredged up everything he said ever placed it in  front of him and asked him to you know take a case by case uh instance by instance and uh apologize 
[00:04:00]  we're getting the clip but erin burnett got our ass handed to her last night at cnn did ted doesn't  fucking give in no ted doesn't play ted's in one of these positions that a few people are in in this  country when you speak your mind there's really nothing anyone can do to him he's his own guy  he does his shows uh he's got a rabid albeit you know it's not as as huge as a lot of other people but 
[00:04:30]  he's got a rabid fan base right that goes see him um and they all love the word mongrel they all love  the word mongrel uh and and he he just does his own thing a lot of his base doesn't care about  political correctness and whatnot so he does fine it's like um who else has ann coulter there's another  one that really can say what she wants with impunity she doesn't apologize and no one can really do  anything to her she's her own girl when you're not under that fucking umbrella of some big politically 
[00:05:00]  correct corporation fuck wads umbrella you can just say what you want it's great it's uh it's  kind of freeing freeing we have a little of that here but you never know we're always looking over  our fucking shoulder that's true uh before i always looking over our shoulder before i hit send on a  tweet i i sometimes uh give a little big consideration as to what i'm putting out there i've thought can i  defend this right i literally have thought like if this is a problem because i have no faith in people's  ability to like take context yes can i defend yes i can okay i have an explanation for it yeah 
[00:05:30]  so we'll have the ted nugent clip in a little bit here that was a good one i don't really respect a  lot of politicians if any if any i should say so i don't i don't mind when they're called just horrible  things in this day and age it's uh they're all fucking just pigs if they can make our lives a lot  easier then maybe i would start giving them a little respect yeah but until then i don't respect any of  them they all suck you were just talking about uh de blasio here in new york city man is the 
[00:06:00]  honeymoon over for this guy the fucking guy and then this if you're buying his shit about safety  and keeping the people of new york safe um he i guess the entire new york city hold on i'm gonna jump  in here for a second uh because he's talking about a few pedestrians get run over every year and that  number is slightly higher in recent years or this past year but the number is so minuscule yeah that  that it shows that most new yorkers are already safe yeah you're gonna have your tragedies every 
[00:06:30]  once in a while no matter what but it's not an epidemic it's not like thousands of people are  getting run over by cars in new york city you're talking i don't even know what the number is it's  it's it's less than a hundred taking the personal fucking thing out of it and and that they are  human beings that are being killed and it's horrible just the numbers game just doing the  numbers right it's it's literally insignificant numbers wise sure don't fucking jump on me uh but 
[00:07:00]  he's jumping on this as a way to pull in money and that's period and redistribute wealth as he loves  to say right so so here it is i guess there were 45 or some some odd uh radar guns in new york city  meaning the outer boroughs thinks that he okay not just manhattan right okay gotcha uh he's getting  200 more and putting them out to uh the the mypd to start getting speeders and and racking up more 
[00:07:30]  money it's all about him raking in money this has nothing to do with safety it's the old revenue stream  exactly that these politicians love coming up with and he figures if you're driving if you have  a car and you're driving in his city oh boy you are rich right so you do you have to give your money  in some way shape or form so he could then take it and give it out as he pleases well first of all  it's almost impossible to speed in manhattan almost impossible you get the west side highway yeah which 
[00:08:00]  is on the edge and the fdr which is on the other edge so you get a couple speeders uh on those roads  but in general the rest of the roads it's almost impossible he'll probably be out there and off  hours when when you can kind of you know right go sit down 57th or something down closer to the east  side uh you know he'll be he'll be picking them off he'll make the nypd uh start handing out some  tickets and now he's uh he's just getting mad because the reporters are asking him about his  driving safety episode when he was uh in an suv and he doesn't really want to talk about it 
[00:08:30]  he's like that has nothing to do with it i'm not going to question the nypd's driving tactics or  oh okay so in other words it's okay for you just don't you do it got it like everything else these  fucking socialist communist fuckwads do they love not just a social communist fuckwads i know they all  do it everybody but he's in there so fair enough you know hey you know giuliani wasn't uh he was 
[00:09:00]  all for uh capitalism and free enterprise and shit like that and you know he was an asshole to  certain people in this city they didn't like him right but it sure wasn't uh the working man or um  your boy business your boy giuliani did all right though hey that's the one i'll take is my boy  giuliani your boy giuliani did all right for this second he started smacking those squeegee  motherfuckers off the streets don't forget though a lot of people hated him before 9-11 oh they hated 
[00:09:30]  him then he became america's sweetheart overnight i remember that took 9-11 it took it took 9-11 you  know what we want to say you got to be careful though uh boy that event was kind of good for him  oh yeah you know god god forbid you say that but the fact is you know america's mayor they were called  the number show amazing before 9-11 he was not he was not that liked he's did a few things that  annoyed me but i liked him overall like i didn't like his brooklyn museum of art like little shit 
[00:10:00]  like that bugged me like a little moral policing aside from that i think he was great for the city  after fucking dinkins he had such a mess to clean up and did it in relatively short time  um he didn't like us though he he thought we were stupid as he said  he was right and he was absolutely right what do you think of that he's stupid we gotta put that in  the intro stupid stupid stupid he actually had a comment about us the mayor called us stupid he had a 
[00:10:30]  comment about the opian anthony show is that when we got arrested right yeah they're stupid yeah we got  that clip somewhere someone asked him at a press conference and he had to say they're  stupid oh boy god why why are we on the mayor's radar i don't want to be that's two i like being  under all these motherfuckers radar ah what are you gonna do what you gonna do hey uh so the todd

[00:32:30]  very quick it's hard to keep up yeah yeah yeah well they probably shouldn't have said get a life  yeah i mean all of a sudden he got into your personal it's a picture of sal in a thong  dice when dice looking at him going what the fuck is wrong with these guys silenced troy kwan  okay i completely agree with uh dice that day oh yeah is that a year ago already i'm getting out of  here yeah we're prepping now for the second annual gay off no we're not doing the second  annual gay off no we can hold that with the first day well it's fair enough right i mean look if you 
[00:33:00]  guys want to fucking keep the tradition alive feel free feel free but i'll miss that day yeah i'll  be uh sick oh oh god jesus how do you do that oh god that guy's sucking his own dick he looks like  kanye i mean we all tried but yeah jesus how many are possible yeah some of us are taking yoga just  so we can get better at it get a life jimmy get a life all right some of you guys need to get a  life wow that tranny has a one crooked penis and it says time to rise and time rise and shine for 
[00:33:30]  the todd show oh then it's a tranny who's fully erect with a penis sucking a man's penis oh and  one penis is very crooked that's a lot of parentheses um so now we move on to michael sam  huh you know he he's gay and he's trying to like make it in the nfl i guess big it's a big to-do  on the uh sports shows and news shows all right i don't give the fuck if they're gay jesus christ 
[00:34:00]  who cares uh yeah this this the first gay player in a professional sport right in the north america  cares i i really don't i don't know what the whole fucking gist is i know arizona's got like  this thing going on where they want to be able to businesses um i want to be able to refuse service  to gays which is just weird i i don't get that whole thing either um it's like anything else i 
[00:34:30]  think if if a straight person comes in and they're they're dressed distractingly or alarming everyone  has the right you have the right as a business owner to refuse service but not to interfere with  anyone's civil rights in doing so but how are they going to know you're gay going to an arizona  a restaurant they're gonna have like a little pop quiz at the front door i guess if you're  canoodling in one of the booths with another gentleman yeah something like that uh so it's 
[00:35:00]  odd i don't know how much tolerance there really is out there for gay people we get a little jaded  here in new york city because you know it's very accepted because it's everywhere  there's acceptance and there's holy fuck enough already well i don't know what it is around the  rest of the country do we need to be like pushing this like this if you see two guys canoodling in  a booth at a restaurant does it why who gives a fuck why would that say move over 
[00:35:30]  got room for one more slide in exactly you mind if i grab a hold of those mozzarella sticks  and you know what i'm talking about they also i read this article and they said that they don't  use that that whatever that they said they're going to use to refuse gay service that probably  wouldn't hold up under like scrutiny and that's never been used in court as a gay service so you're  saying they would be allowed to use it or or the courts would say you can't use it wouldn't work  like i i think whatever the i forget the abbreviation whatever it is that they're trying to push 
[00:36:00]  through like it's got something to do with exercising religious freedom all right like uh hey it's  against our religious freedom to have these guys in it or something like that you can't  discriminate for sexual orientation it's just it's you know you're not allowed to do it but are we  really that like in other parts maybe we get jaded in new york and you know we like why the fuck are  they still talking about this yeah but then like the rest of the country is still kind of doing  stuff like that yeah yeah all right new york and la or san francisco and a few other places but but  we've been under the gun as far as community standards go too you know where where as you 
[00:36:30]  say something in new york and it's not offensive but it's offensive somewhere in the midwest or  something so you do have some kind of right to community standards right i don't know what that  is anymore i don't know how far you can go with it you know obviously you can't put a blacks only  bathroom sign up uh again that's a civil rights issue um so to refuse gays based solely on the 
[00:37:00]  fact that they're gay is a civil rights issue i don't think it could be done i don't think that's  right it would hold up i just don't think that's right that's unbelievable who cares about the gays  this much i could give a shit if the entire team is gay it doesn't fucking matter by that he means the  crew working right you know we got a good start in there with travis but you know and get a life  i should just get a life maybe to get a life i really do need to get a life it sure makes uh doing 
[00:37:30]  radio fun because this fucking country is getting really weird it's just getting strange by the day  you really just look around and it's getting odd really just odd everyone's just a little off if you  care that much about gay guys canoodling in a booth in a restaurant i think you're gay  well and that's i was gonna say there's something going on with you that you're not  yeah comfortable with you're at the very least getting a little titillated when you 
[00:38:00]  it makes you angry that it's like oh right right yeah i think it means you're just not sure of your  own sexuality you're not sure maybe you're a little bi curious you can't look at the two guys  fucking making out in a restaurant booth or something it's like who the fuck i don't want  it you know what i don't want my day to be so full of gay every day you turn on the news  gay gay gay gay gay just enough enough with the gay let them just lead their miserable lives like 
[00:38:30]  everybody else there's a story in the paper today an ex-nfl-er who played for the giants  yeah who was the second uh gay guy to come out after his career after he was the second though  they had to say that in the article uh died 57 years old oh that doesn't sound good and i believe  he had the uh the hiv oh did he the ninja the high five nickname was sugar bear oh yes that's today's 
[00:39:00]  uh gay story ah that's today's gay story he was the second one it's all about to announce he was gay  after his career which is different than announcing while you're still playing which is a whole thing  that's probably hard for back to like now it's not as bad but it's probably hard and i think that's  another reason as much as i hate the nfl's fucking selective morality they're fucking they know that  they're about to get probably a lot of gay players like like in the next few years they already have  a lot of gay players no no i don't mean i mean openly like people say it and they're afraid they're 
[00:39:30]  probably afraid that what's going to happen is hey faggot all that stuff in the locker room right  they're going to all of a sudden start facing lawsuits for uh a certain type of work environment  because it's not like race like guys will still say shit like that where they you know guys aren't  going to call black guys a nigger in the locker room because you get your teeth knocked out but  they might not feel as threatened calling a guy a faggot in the locker room and all of a sudden a  football team after this fucking richie incognito thing is gonna have to face a player going hey this  is a hostile work environment right and then the lawsuits come in it's all fucking tied to cutting off 
[00:40:00]  lawsuits charles barkley said it best he said there's there's been gay players throughout  history we all and he goes we all know it yeah we all knew this is not a big deal uh well  vinnie in the squad hi how you doing just wow i just got a text oh the squad's listening to the  show nice let's say hi to larry in washington larry go get him hi lar good morning boys  welcome aboard larry you were talking about how the people in the rest of the country how they 
[00:40:30]  feel and maybe you guys in new york city don't care my wife resides south of san francisco east  asheville north carolina and it is absolutely san francisco east and she cares very deeply she  spent a lot of money buying anti-gay literature mailing it to every member of the senate and every  supreme court justice and on more than one occasion every time a new congress comes out she renews her  mailings uh-huh you know to stand against the sodomite agenda wait your wife does this sodomite 
[00:41:00]  agenda okay well yeah my wife does this sure it's based on religion right but of course yeah how do  you feel about that you agree with her does she annoy you with it no no i completely totally agree with  her the bible is unambiguous on that point that's true areas when it comes to sodomite that is  called in the bible abomination absolutely right and i guess i and i also think that if you don't  honor your mother and father you should probably be uh killed or whatever the original penalties in 
[00:41:30]  the bible were yeah well there were original penalties in the mosaic law but the mosaic law  had a purpose to identify sin and to let man know that there was no way man could live up to the standards  of the law don't people don't people when they speak about religion sound kooky yeah it really i i  don't know no disrespect sir i'd rather not have an afterlife if this is what it's all about is what  it comes down to i'll accept the fact that my my soul turns off like a fucking computer i don't give a 
[00:42:00]  fuck i don't need an afterlife if this is what it means if we're talking about religious freedoms in  this country which you're supposed to have yes and rights and and the muslim religion is allowed to  practice what they want and and whatnot shouldn't this guy be able to read his bible and say that  uh gays are an abomination and speak openly and freely about it without the consequence of uh  you know retribution absolutely yeah absolutely you you i don't think what you're saying stinks and i 
[00:42:30]  would hate to be and you have your life but i think you have every right to say it yeah of course  if he doesn't like gay people based on his religion and what the bible says i'm fine with that but i  think if you go out of your way to i mean this is if you go out of your way to lobby against other  people's life liberty and the pursuit of happiness i just think you're shitty i just think you're a shit  american if that's what you believe god hold on if that's what you believe and that's fine i'm not 
[00:43:00]  going to question that don't worry about it god will take care of those people why are you getting  involved who gives a will he ever why do you have to why do you have to put your two cents into it  satan's pitchfork up your ass for eternity right and it's safe to say larry that does someone bible  says do but they're safe to say the odds to do that the odds show that there's probably someone gay  very close to you that you don't even know about on the phone with you right now  larry it's just silly larry what are you doing like why do these people have to get involved 
[00:43:30]  if you believe in god god will fucking do his thing don't worry about it the creator of black  holes in the universe and and and light years and space-time bending cares if someone is sticking  a dick in another fucking creature with the same janitor like come on dude it's so that's nonsense  that's not correct either oh it's not about like or don't like it's about right and wrong it's what  we believe is right yes adam and steve i know once again the show's not questioning what you believe 
[00:44:00]  but why do you have to get so involved with it if god in the end will take care of all that  oh he will all right so then then you have nothing to worry about yeah he will you're right he's  terrific no you're right he's terrific he's doing a good job so far terrific job all right you're a  good good point like you and your wife keep mailing out those flyers hold on a minute uh tom in virginia 
[00:44:30]  wants in tom you're on with larry hey larry um north carolina is like the barbecue capital of the  world and the old testament says you can't eat pork so what are you doing there you're sticking and  well the bible says don't eat pork because pig is an unclean animal and it's not good for you  but are you eating pork because that's against i mean if you want to eat pork that's your business  my wife doesn't eat dead pig and she gets extremely upset you hear what he said that's your business 
[00:45:00]  but what about the other yeah what about the gay people why aren't you lobbying against that  if the gay people want to eat dead pig let them eat dead pig we're just trying to point out to our  lawmakers that it's wrong how come you're not writing to the lawmakers whoa larry how come you're not  writing lawmakers having these pork stores why not aren't you asking for them to be outlawed  because mosaic law is not a requirement under the bible it's if you want to live properly you will 
[00:45:30]  stay kosher and you'll be blessed for staying kosher and you'll be extremely healthy but see when we  like the people state of north carolina decided to change their constitution to not allow gay marriage  we don't allow i think it's a lousy move and you larry let me continue sir please it's extremely  extremely important it's not important larry it's garbage it's garbage it's nonsense all right okay all  right we got pam on the line pam you're on with larry you're losing your mind i hear i'm losing my 
[00:46:00]  fucking mind listening to this guy to his wife you are a christian these people these hypocritical  fucking christians that i live with down here in south carolina by the way they go and they judge  other people for what they love and what they believe in you're not a christian then and the bible  is a fucking story it's a story it's a fairy tale that guy's a fucking asshole i i seriously i'm losing  my shit people like that drive me crazy mind your own business go sit in your room and read your 
[00:46:30]  bible that is a story a fucking fairy tale and highlight it and have your bible study classes  every wednesday night and leave leave everybody else alone shut the fuck up all right thank you  sorry i'm done screaming all right thank you anthony in staten island anthony oh i'm here yeah the bible  also mentions that god is the only true judge and it shouldn't be up to man to do so and it also  tells you at what length you're allowed to beat your slave so i'm guessing slavery should be reinstated 
[00:47:00]  larry i've already talked to you guys about slavery once you brought up that exact point and i explained  how slavery was in the bible days and slavery has slaves i don't think he's the bible dude i swear it's  written dude if it's written in the bible isn't it supposed to be lost but you're not understanding  what i'm trying to say i'm not talking about loving you're not loving you i'm saying the actions are  wrong there's 15 right you're wrong the actions are wrong bullshit my entire life so don't tell me i 
[00:47:30]  don't understand hey look well you know what it's like it's like um uh let's say murder as a crime  it's like murder as a crime and speeding you know they're both technically you're you're breaking  the law in some fashion but gay is like murder right and you know eating pork is like a parking  ticket yeah no but that's not what it says that's not what oh larry let me ask you larry larry literal  ass you'll know the answer to this i i honestly don't know i've heard it debated but you'll probably 
[00:48:00]  know the answer how many times is homosexuality mentioned in the bible oh i don't know how many  times sodomy is mentioned in the bible but i know in the book of ephesians it claims to be  it claims to be called abomination and when paul rose to the church of corinth in the book of  corinth he told the church of corinth not to look down their nose on sinners against sinners because  shut down the balls on your nose because they were looking down their nose at sodomites as being 
[00:48:30]  sinners and paul said look you are sinners as well they need salvation they don't need condemnation  their own actions condemned them who's salvation yeah exactly so like salvation and manny yeah  manivation and salvation salvation you know larry i know there's a lot of you're representing a lot of  people's point of view in the country you're not like you know i understand that you're not i find  it embarrassing and repulsive and i'm sure you find my lifestyle and beliefs the same way oh  fair enough let me say hi to joker one more joker la or uh louisiana louisiana all right you're on with 
[00:49:00]  larry full of shit man why do you guys take larry's all and i'm only saying this opposing  viewpoints sir yeah and larry's not alone dude he's not the only guy who feels that way  yeah okay jimmy no but he's not he's not there's a huge north carolina that are railing his wife  while he's out dude you asked why we take his call i don't like what larry says at all i think it stinks  but you can't not take the guy's call i mean you know it's like what are we going to represent his 
[00:49:30]  point of view he's got to do it he has a right to say it believe it and say it uh his beliefs  without consequence i think yeah as far as um we just think he's wrong yeah we don't agree with  it's pretty obvious we think he's wrong i think he needs a big cock in his mouth but that's just  that's my answer for everything so i'm jerking off here how childish was that what we both just said  no terribly consequences i do i understand speech has consequences i can get hung up on immediately by  saying one thing you want me to say it no i don't know what you're talking about 
[00:50:00]  jammy you're the man buddy you're there sammy he's not even in the room larry as we wish we  weren't it doesn't matter sammy's still your big moment was a bust what a what a bust that was exactly  is that the guy that likes sam i think so oh see we don't even know larry yeah it's our channel we  don't know we're not larry is that the guy likes you or something religious idiots oh god see we  don't even know i know he was going for a big moment you weren't even here you don't even know 
[00:50:30]  sam is gay larry sam doesn't know he's gay right and it wasn't a big revelation by the way there was  a lot of people on pal talk right in front of me that was saying this is the larry from because  sam's show so we knew everybody hated him before yeah now they're really gonna hate him politically but  you know i just don't understand why they have to get so involved right if you believe in your  god right your god will take care of all that you know go to church pray for the gay people  pray for their salvation pray that they find the right way to live their life adhering to the words 
[00:51:00]  of god but to go out and get literature and give it to people and say that you need to you know do  things to interfere with their right to live is is a weird i don't understand that we don't know anything  about larry but the odds are good that there's someone around him that is gay absolutely whether  it's whether it's an uncle an aunt larry i don't know if they have kids but the odds are pretty  strong so how are you going to handle that if that ever comes out larry well you just disown them and 
[00:51:30]  never speak to them again it's just a bizarre way to live to be to obsess that much over what somebody  else is doing look at this big queen just yeah yeah for the you guys can't see but kenny just sashayed  into the room wearing an overcoat and overcoat and a crown  and if you i like like if that's what god is and i don't believe that he's just then he's just a lot  of people saying i'm a christian and and i think larry's a prick so yeah he's a prick but 
[00:52:00]  all right there are people that adhere to that old school thought yeah they don't on the bible  you know this started with the michael sam video that we didn't even really get to so we'll do that  after the break and see what happens though when you talk about the gay exactly and this is what  happens on tv and this is why they push it and stuff and we have to hear it every day i don't care  about the game because there's people like and i'm i shouldn't say loud but there's people that feel  that way right right so you know so we hear you got gays and all right enough ready you're gay we get 
[00:52:30]  it but that's what they deal with it's hard to push that agenda on you know people that really  hold on to that bible yeah wow and that's why but that's in a way why you have to legislate certain  like like civil rights things because you could feel how you want but you can't have a guy not live  the same uh get the same rights as you have but the civil rights also protect people's right to  religion i agree and and it it is i don't think there's any contra no not controversy there's  plenty of controversy i don't think there's any doubt in lawmakers minds that they do have a right 
[00:53:00]  to not accept the gay lifestyle based on their religion so you got that weird church state thing  uh that is is a quandary with with with um like civil rights as far as uh black people in  in the 60s and 70s why not um you there's no religion that says that you know we should keep  uh black people separate from no really weren't they used they were using the bible of course they 
[00:53:30]  were trying you know it was a little a little shaky there you know but but with the gay issue it's a lot  easier for them to grab the bible and say look this is our right right under our religion um which we have  the freedom to practice here in the united states to not accept the gay lifestyle then let your  religion pay taxes how about that how about your fucking religion and it pays land tax and pays tax  on all that money they take in fucking how about that you want them to be listened to yeah well they 
[00:54:00]  could shut up well they could shut up i hear you gotta get the show back on track we better go back into  the todd world oh please uh we got the uh the michael sam video we got the michael sam video oh it's  great he's got a boner it's hilarious but it's a tiny little it's a tiny little boner we'll play the  video and discuss also we got the ted nugent clip uh oh goody going at it with erin burnett  erin burnett got her ass handed to her last night as they were discussing mongrel and everything else that 
[00:54:30]  ted nugent said yeah you gotta see the latest rob ford clip i didn't see it i had a fire hydrant one  i mean it's all right look it'll be it'll be on fire we could get that seconds of radio but we could  get that out of the way he he was celebrating the the you know canada's gold medal victory and there  was a whole bunch of press around him and he's walking and he almost like slammed his nuts into a  fire hydrant it could have been better yeah he says he injured his groin he didn't injure his  groin i think he hit his he tapped it i think he hit his dick you can't tell fat people where the 
[00:55:00]  dick is really it's very difficult yeah is it up higher is it lower the fat is there i have no  idea somewhat what is that uh foo foo foo foo foo foo foo foo foo right f-u-p-a right f-u-p-a i was  thinking foobar for a second foobar foo-pa he's all right look let's get it out of the way right  it's um but this is a real story yes in canada city hall news today mayor rob ford reminded us 
[00:55:30]  all it's a good idea to always watch where you step great to see rob  see it's just a slight tap  he's laughing for it had a very close encounter with a fire hydrant  while celebrating canada's gold medal hockey win he's a rock star yeah he really is black people 
[00:56:00]  love him around in uh in like toronto yeah because he's goofy he's the mayor he's the goddamn mayor  and he's sitting there going oh i tapped my balls on this fire hydrant my dick  you know what i would have said to him what walk much  so michael sam  him he's doing the nfl uh combine is that what that thing is where they see how quick they are  oh is that it they gotta uh check your numbers to see if your nfl material yeah and uh he was kind 
[00:56:30]  of a boss so far or he is a boss so far his numbers are not that great and you know he's he's the gay  guy so that's why everyone's uh paying attention to him yeah that's the only reason they should be  paying attention uh paying they should be paying attention to him because he's a player but yeah  you put the gay in front of it then wow you get a lot more media attention i guess yeah he's an  average player middle of the road right travis yeah that's what i've heard i don't follow college  football i don't either i've heard he's a mid-rounder and right some people think he's overrated because

[00:57:30]  thing got a shot now yeah he goes away i don't need to be dragged into litigation it's there they  get in divorce after nine years there's a great picture of robin thick i don't know if you guys  ever seen it is it from the mtv movie awards i think and there's this blonde that wants a picture  with robin thick uh-huh and he's got his arm around her and he thinks he's getting away with a  little something he goes for the the heinie grab now if you're looking at the picture you go it's 
[00:58:00]  just uh a fan getting a little maybe a little too close to robin thick but it happens with these  celebrities right sure there was a mirror behind and you could see the full heinie grab and he is  like almost trying to get a digit in like down low on the ass here it is look at that make that bigger  look yeah yeah let's see that he's oh he's almost uh in there where is he can't really make that out  oh no you can make it oh my god he's underneath grabbing her asshole but the best part the picture 
[00:58:30]  on the left he he thinks he's getting away with something because that picture looks like oh look  no he's just taking a picture with a fan that's the way he makes some smile for the picture smile  he's got oh he's lifting her dress yes yeah yeah she has a short skirt on and it looks like he's trying  to get he's getting a little digit in there finger for later right yeah yeah he's like i want to  remember you she's a great little heinie too so uh he's a bad boy yeah his wife was a bad boy yes 
[00:59:00]  yeah she's she's had it with him yeah she's too hot to be cheated on he's had it that's it i'm sure  we were together nine years i guess she came in here for that yeah like you said mission impossible yeah  wow she was that was the one right mission impossible gorgeous holy shit anyway i guess  the pussy's flying in for him so he's just like this marriage so michael sam there's a video on tmz sports  where he's uh going through his drills and then he's walking away from one of the drills and 
[00:59:30]  it looks like he's got a boner he's got a uh he's got something in his pants it looks like he's got a  a boner it's not a cup it's pointing straight out like a bobo dick right look at this jimmy and if  it is a boner he's not really packing much now in the football evaluation portion right there  that looks ridiculous but it's weird because don't you know where your boner is at all times yeah 
[01:00:00]  don't you don't you tuck that up or something that's weird i will say that is a very  drop it down and walk too he's got a very feminine little walk there down the field  no it's just that his quads are sore is that yeah a lot of drills a lot of drills it'll make you walk  like that it's not sporting much if that's what else could it be though that's a boner right  it couldn't be a cup doesn't it plumped up a little bit maybe right which needs to reposition  yeah you strap it down something you pull it up pull it down i gotta do it my giant thing 
[01:00:30]  i was trying to uh teach my kid how to strap it down oh yeah and he just didn't want it  why what what is it he said it was hurting him oh boy so i said well if you it's so weird what  you gotta do as a father go well if you you know point it up and then you could kind of strap it down  and so underwear band right right so he tried that he didn't like that he wants it you know pointing 
[01:01:00]  down even though it's crazy in the upright position that's uh that's painful right there  extremely painful you can't do that you can't do that no hells no want to talk about ted nugent  the newge the newge uh used to do our show a lot we had him on uh and then we saw him at uh in  c-e-s i think right c-e-s we liked him he he is very very entertaining and he used to do some radio  i believe and he was very good at it because he gets people uh a talking he can talk he can talk and 
[01:01:30]  talk and talk yeah so uh what's the story here with ted nugent he went on cnn finally to kind of  explain himself he's not an obama fan and he's stumping for some uh some republicans yeah stumping for  some of his he's stumping for some of your boys some of my boys and uh got himself in a little uh  hot water got himself a little uh hot water with uh but the thing is with either side um the the the 
[01:02:00]  fox news is ready to just pounce and uh msnbc cnn and then all the rest are ready to pounce on the  other side right so they look for anything and then um you know ted nugent's uh one of these guys he just  he says what he wants says what the fuck he wants and you know they're treating him like he's one of  these guys that'll cower under uh interrogation right uh but he didn't the reason i think he  apologized at all is because the one thing they can take from ted is they can they can uh distance 
[01:02:30]  themselves from him that's all they can do it's the same with an culture they're like and she writes  books she'll get published but they can distance themselves yeah uh if you say something so crazy that  they can't be associated with and that's why ted with this one was like all right trying to do a  little damage control because he wants to be able to stump for these guys he doesn't want these  conservative politicians gonna look man you you're saying yeah i can't be associated with right and  he also knows he's seen this shit you can't just not say anything because the news spins it out of 
[01:03:00]  control and and that's all the people here and now you got his side right so uh he's smart in that  way well erin burnett i watch her on cnn she tries to come across tough but she's not that tough really  and uh she was she was in over her head with ted nugent yeah absolutely ted nugent knows a lot of  words he can talk he knows a lot of good words boy and tries to use them all in every conversation 
[01:03:30]  he comes across uh as a bit of an ass at times he's a bit of a blowhard he's done it on our show  where we try to challenge him on stuff and he he basically tells us we you know we're not smart  enough to understand so let jimmy used to do that great impression let uncle ted do you just sit back  and uncle ted was his essence by the way  are so distracting the cat scratch fever  my asses are strangling me dude his asses are really bad yeah they're pretty bad so uh 
[01:04:00]  i guess uh erin asked ted about the use of the word mongo go ted i want to get straight to this uh  question of whether you apologized or not a lot of people still say gives a  fuck if anyone apologizes because we're not sure what's the apology count and we all know if 
[01:04:30]  someone does apology uh apologize it's a fake apology means nothing because they're being forced  to apologize right because their livelihood is at stake but do you see how dishonest she is how she  tries to get him into the conversation like if he said he's sorry it's done but there has to just keep  going she wants her opinion she wants to weigh in i don't think it is done if he said yeah i apologize  that's the problem okay okay yeah i want to get straight to this uh question of whether you  apologized or not a lot of people still say you didn't apologize did you mean it aaron come on 
[01:05:00]  you've got this english language down really well i bet you understand when the question is do you  apologize and i answer yes you don't really have to ask that question again do you but i want to  understand why you used the word mongrel when you did i'll tell you i've been a cop in lake county  michigan since 1982 or thereabouts i conduct federal raids with the dea and atf and the u.s marshals  and the fbi and texas rangers and the heroes of law enforcement and we're re-arresting fugitive felons  who are let out of their cages after murdering and raping and molesting children carjacking we keep 
[01:05:30]  going after these guys the adrenaline is something like you'll never experience i hope you never have  to experience it but when we're done with these kinds of raids we get together and our hearts are broken  that we have to face these monsters and we call them mongrels we call bad people who are destroying  our neighborhoods mongrels i knew of no racial reference i don't believe that he knew of no  racial reference he might have meant it not racially but come on you're not stupid yeah but again it's 
[01:06:00]  just you know he's doing that but also you gotta sit there and defend yourself yeah of course and whatever  you know another thing is if you don't like somebody you'll call them the worst thing ever so what why  are we why do we think we're gonna hold back a couple of notches why do we make believe that  doesn't right right when you're mad as a person you're you don't you don't go boy i really can't  stand this person but i'm gonna pull back a couple of notches on what i say especially like but 
[01:06:30]  privately or something you know you'd say it anyway you're gonna say it you know people didn't like  george w bush and they called him you know fucking hitler uh just terrible things but because he's a  white guy it can't be misconstrued as a racist i wasn't a big bush fan but to call him hitler  that's pretty brutal that's pretty fucking brutal that hitler word is thrown around too like to the  point where it doesn't mean anything anymore like racist i mean you know i get called racist constantly 
[01:07:00]  no i don't even fucking give a shit by that guy in the mirror right you're racist he called obama  mongrel right yeah yeah yeah all right so is that worse than calling bush a uh bush a uh bush hitler  no i think it's but they're both extremely offensive and uh whatever but if you're if you're angry with  somebody don't put this phony morality on your anger because it's fake people when they're pissed at  someone they will say or think awful things about that person and words do come up i mean the most 
[01:07:30]  liberal person in the world i don't give a shit if if somebody does you wrong you're gonna look at them  and pick the worst possible thing you can call them and at least think it  it continued let me ask you about something else you said about the president though since you're saying  there was nothing racial about it i'm hoping you can explain a certain word here in that same  conversation that i played for you where you subhuman mongrel you also said this a lot of people 
[01:08:00]  would call that inflammatory speech well i would call it inflammatory speech when it's your job to  protect americans and then you ask to look into the television camera and say what difference does it  make that i failed in my job to provide security and we have four dead americans what difference does that  make not to a chimpanzee or to hillary clinton i guess it doesn't matter chimpanzee yeah aaron i  appreciate you playing that do you really think that i reference any race it is a primate i call my 
[01:08:30]  buddies in my band chimpanzees when they miss a good guitar lick come on give me a break on that  i reference no racial overtones there whatsoever i was referencing people who would look in the camera  i don't fully believe i do not believe him at all i don't think he was trying to be i don't think  he's being like black people are chimpanzees but i think he's just he said that about obama and why  can't you i'm not saying you can't i just don't believe his explanation but but for the her and on a  news program to be like trying to get him on on language like this who gives a shit what he calls 
[01:09:00]  the fucking obama he's a guitar player would aaron burnett be questioning nikki minaj the same way about  saying right 42 times 42 times yeah i think so what did jesse jackson call obama he said uh he's  talking down to niggas i'd like to rip his balls off right right how about you get him on there  and talk about how he was talking about uh uh ripping the president's balls off how about that 
[01:09:30]  instead of ted nugent the guitar player the detroit city madman instead of just uh words that's like a  violent that's a violent violent act he he imagines he would like to do he has a lot more pull with  people uh than ted nugent does i mean it's just hypocrites overtones there whatsoever i was  referencing people who would look in the camera with there's four dead americans in benghazi and and  and refuse to be accountable and say what difference does it make in fact my whole life is dedicated to 
[01:10:00]  my black heroes my black musical heroes and you know that i have no not a racist bone in my body  that's the the saul alinsky propaganda ministry running amok like your goofball friend paul bagala  who claims that my i've missed i has been i just celebrated my 50th greatest tour i know one year  number one guitar player in detroit last year i'm a black guitar player from detroit get over it all i know  is that if i called the president who is a black president a chimpanzee i would and should be fired 
[01:10:30]  because it is a racist thing to say i didn't call the president who are you referring to never called  the president a chimpanzee not to a chimpanzee or hillary not trying to you think you think i you  think i hesitate people who support that it doesn't matter four americans are dead people who looked  into the television camera and said what i mean that the people you're referring to well i will leave  it to our viewer to decide whether that was a direct reference to the president or not  it was and i i think ted it was i don't think he was thinking black people i think he's just in one 
[01:11:00]  of those things where you'd say something stupid or lousy about someone thank you yeah that's always  but she's trying to get but he can't on up to that one she's trying to get him yes she is she's trying  to get a gotcha moment she's trying to get the news loves that gotcha moment don't they ever don't they  good for fucking ted yeah i like the way you handled him talk there's a little more i wanted to ask you  something that obviously is personal to me as well and that is that this isn't just about the president  in terms of the things that you say and how you say them and the tone that you have for for your 
[01:11:30]  base people um women in particular here are some of the things words you've used to describe hillary  clinton i obviously can't say them on this program but they include the toxic c-word worthless  bitch and two-bit whore these are all things you've used to describe her and and and my issue is  whether you agree with her politics or not there are people who listen to you and care deeply about  what you say how can they not be offended by terms like that well aaron and i i have a very 
[01:12:00]  important advisory board i've got nine wonderful kids and 11 grandkids and they're constantly telling  me over the years dad honey quit calling people names so i'm stopping calling people names are you  going to say that you're never going to call people names again live on air they're there trying for the  gotcha moment and she's going to get it to say and for the record right oh god everybody's got to  be used to have the right on the record you used to have the right to be offended in america remember 
[01:12:30]  those days it's just used to have that right but now it's just not okay again live on aaron burnett  out front cnn ted nugent remember the alamo february 24th 2014 i'm not going to call people names  anymore however i have a little escape clause here because when i'm on stage singing wang dang sweet  poontang would you give me permission to go overboard on occasion please tell me you will i think that to 
[01:13:00]  me i mean i know you're trying to make slightly light of this but to me these things are not light at all  because in a country that you know these are very long shut up very serious very serious create more  polarization is a horrible thing to do you're right mike my children my brothers my sister and my  wonderful wife shemaine have told me that over and over and i think at the tender age of 65 i think  you're absolutely correct she's a phony she stinks shut up oh you know i don't make light of this 
[01:13:30]  fuck you and your biased network polarization get get a black guy up there and talk about the  polarization that that the likes of reverend al and jesse jackson and uh the naacp and the black  panthers get them up there and talk about the polarization you phony fuck fuck her we got a call  coming in cunt john in ohio john hey hey i just i just want to say that aaron burnett is the biggest 
[01:14:00]  fucking hypocrite she called george bush a monkey on on tv did she i heard that but i haven't seen  we find that clip there's a clip there's a clip on youtube all right all right let me sam roberts  if you will but that's your magic tickle the old ivories over there that's okay because bush is white  white he would have said that to her she would have said well he's not a black president she was  saying about calling people names that's fucking her calling him all right yeah she doesn't like the  name calling let's see what aaron burnett wants to well nicholas sarkozy is in china which of course 
[01:14:30]  is also trying to become a financial capital of the world and in honor of his visit the chinese  have announced 30 billion dollars of deals there he is i mean who could not have a man crush on that  man i'm not talking about the monkey either i'm talking about the other one yeah exactly what a monkey  he's a monkey um what's she talking about wait monkey in the middle all right i don't know what's  she talking about willie you know i think she's still jet lagged that's my president i don't know  i know she's not talking about why are you talking about angela merkel like that i don't understand 
[01:15:00]  all right um yeah she's attacking merkel she's an ally in the time of war  erin is trying to be light there and this polarization uh is not really healthy between  yeah what the fuck she was just trying to be funny and it failed hypocrites look at how they  all backed up who did you who did you eat right yeah yeah play the rest of the club it's just about  done listen my dear let me tell you something when i'm jet lagged i just take ambien some tylenol p.m  and i sleep it off okay it was my stop in riad and it just made me insane thank you oh well there 
[01:15:30]  you go you were doing a little name calling there yourself her and burnett call him a monkey there you go  you can't call people things like that uh without a racial implication i would imagine when ted nugent  said mongrel he was kind of having a little fun with that oh boy right or chimpanzee i don't know  sure sounds racist to me oh that's right bush is white yeah so you could say anything yeah 
[01:16:00]  i don't know if i don't take this lightly uh uh uh fucking 15 yarders  i knew there would be a spin there back on his own one yard line  anthony back on his own one he can't seem to move that ball forward at all exactly his own team is  talking to the referees what did we say first in 85 or something yeah yeah i should anyway all 
[01:16:30]  right wow that was some good tv last night though for sure everyone needs to get over it oh is that  what is that your get over it song it's an eagle song oh oh okay that one yeah it's one of their new  ones i know i didn't like that one it was okay i didn't love it some of their sappier stuff you saw  the rest of the uh i did i enjoyed it a lot i finally saw the whole thing too you can see henley 
[01:17:00]  and fry are a little bit of pricks but those are the guys that kind of fly more maybe yeah i think  you're right fry seems like he's a big prick don felder was stupid and don felder just should have let  it go because when they got back together i guess glenn fry and don henley said look we wrote most of  these songs we're going to take a little bigger piece of the pie and uh felder especially was not happy  about that and also they were like say well you know we're the ones that kept the music alive  like they were the ones who were out doing gigs and like you know uh one of them they had their 
[01:17:30]  grammy they had successful solo careers which just kept the the the eagle's name alive yeah absolutely  and don felder did not care for that no there's a big lawsuit to that that wasn't in the documentary  i read that after on wikipedia you get 50 million dollar lawsuit that's they probably all hate each  other now beyond repair are they still touring i don't know i think so they got back together in  94 so they've been doing this for 20 years they must love that since getting back together it's like  luck we'll just put up with each other i love a good rock uh documentary though it was good rock talk 
[01:18:00]  a rockumentary glenn fry was uh and jerry mcguire i forgot he had a scene with tom cruise although it was  on the on the phone so i i will guarantee he never saw tom cruise during the only scene no the was  there other scenes no i'm not sure i don't get over it i didn't like that the best is the smugglers  blues i like that episode of miami vice it's it's a guilty pleasure that dumb saw but the miami vice 
[01:18:30]  episode yeah well he was running some drugs in the plane oh yeah drug runner i think yep he was the  drug smugglers blues oh yeah boy what a cheesy ass show that was get over it it'sville tennessee  what's up matt how you doing matty good morning gentlemen how are you all and they are still  touring people are uh calling up with that that's unbelievable yes they they are still touring they  came in a school uh i guess a couple months ago and they actually put on a phenomenal show uh played 
[01:19:00]  all the hits it wasn't a bunch of garbage that people what else are they gonna do of course they're  gonna play all the hits yeah well they were kind of doing this thing where uh uh glenn fry came out  first with don henley and that they went through this whole storyline about how they played together  for the first time and then uh they'd play a couple songs and then another guy come around and they tell  a story how they met him and uh i'll say this glenn fry is a douche bag why is this a douche bag he 
[01:19:30]  just you could tell on stage that he was just he's a dick you could tell on stage from yeah how far away  were you language i was probably 30 rows back oh and you could tell i could tell i'm no body language  expert but he kind of gives that vibe off yeah he does you could tell he's a pompous asshole and i 
[01:20:00]  need to be honest he's great in the eagles but i didn't like his solo stuff at all no you didn't like  smugglers blue no what is that what was the other song he had i think he's terrible he had uh  they had the other one in the documentary we had the other one  i don't know what's what's another glenn fry solo song he had a few  the heat is on that was him right oh right it's not a terrible song but it was a huge hit  that was a huge song what was that from it was from a movie beverly hills beverly hills 
[01:20:30]  god it was right that was a huge that was a huge song that would be good  but this reminds me of every type of music i hated the 80s the dumb horn  you can do this the 80s dance right i'm gonna do the age dance  yeah this is a this was a big hit in the 80s it sure was let's go to danny in jersey danny 
[01:21:00]  hey buddy hey hey listen i didn't know if you're done kicking erin burnett around but um  she kind of omitted a good clip of obama when he appeared on the view using the word mongrels to  describe african americans obama used the word mongrel do we know this yeah yeah i don't know if you  could look it up i saw it on a great um website that i go to what site is that sir  that's not too bad it's actually just a conservative site yes yes it's a conservative 
[01:21:30]  site i've never heard this clip so obama used the word mongrel yeah describe he said i don't know  verbatim but he said something like they're sort of a mongrel um uh society or sort of a mongrel  something but definitely check it out can i see that clip chance thanks yes before you're fired  the big glenn fry song is the one you love what's that one i don't know sir who's this glenn 
[01:22:00]  i don't know we'll have to go we're don hendley we're doing two things at once right now and  hendley is this don hendley i enjoy your music very much i do very much glenn fry was marvelous  but don hendley was really the heart and soul of that band here it is i love this program to follow  up on whoopi's question you do not describe yourself as a black president but that's the way  you're described um your mother was white white wouldn't be helpful why don't you say i'm not a 
[01:22:30]  black president i'm biracial well you know uh when i was young uh and going through the identity  crises that any teenager goes through i wrote a whole book about this yes um did you  uh part of what i realized was that uh if the if the world saw me as african-american 
[01:23:00]  then that wasn't something that i needed to run away from that's something that i could  go ahead and embrace and the interesting thing about the african-american experience in this country  is that you know we are sort of a mongrel people i mean we're all kind of mixed up yeah  uh oh wow okay oh boy yeah see it's it's just all bullshit so only only they can use the word  mongrel i guess that's got to be five yards but that's not even yeah it's a five girls probably 
[01:23:30]  five yards i like barbara walters for asking anything about race though yeah she was  fucking tiptoeing through the tulips though you hear a voice with her stupid bracelets rattling  you're a black man can i say that it would have been better tv if erin burnett had ted nugent  with the mongrel thing and then plays this clip yeah that would have been some pretty solid reporting  right there it would have went and then have a nice discussion about it nice do you have the radio 
[01:24:00]  of to this i asked him to find the radio can you just listen to ted for one minute like you couldn't  pick it up in the video clip but just listen to his voice he he's unlistenable when he talks  what do we but just the radio piece of ted dude apologize oh oh mediaite i like those guys i like  that song subhuman mongrel um is a derogatory term most people agree with that did you cross the line 
[01:24:30]  by calling the president of the united states of america that and if you saw barack obama  would you apologize to him for saying that about him yes i would i did cross the line i do apologize  not necessarily to the president but on behalf of much better men than myself oh wow the best governor  in america governor rick perry the best attorney general in america got him just think of america  had an attorney general got a little canary on his shoulder we do here in texas so on behalf of 
[01:25:00]  those professional politicians and those who put their heart and soul into representing we the people  so accurately like the gentleman i just mentioned wow apologize for using the street fighter terminology  of subhuman mongrel instead of just using more understandable language such as uh violator of his  oath to uh the constitution uh the the the liar that he is the president lied when he said we can 
[01:25:30]  keep our uh our our doctors and we can remain retain our health care period and that he his department of  defense and department of justice called the ala akbar terrorism at fort hood workplace violence those  those are the real offensive occurrences in america so yes ben i apologize for using the term subhuman  mongrel and i will try to elevate my vernacular to the level of those great men that i'm learning  from in the world of politics wow that's unlistenable right yeah it really is wow i was just waiting 
[01:26:00]  for the next s-word she is tweeting mother holy more on the oh my god okay learned a lot here today  drinking buddy what happened just chip focusing on stuff that's not going on it's not going on  with the conversation oh uh john in pennsylvania john hey uh i don't know if you knew but uh nugent 
[01:26:30]  i think was the one that told her to bring that clip up of the view that was his suggestion to the  show wait he did yeah yeah he said i thank you for playing that wait no no no did he ask during that  interview last night they kind of prefaced it by him saying oh you know the reason i'm on here is  like i told you to go grab that uh clip from the view and they actually did you know so he was like  thanking her for actually getting that also wait so they played the view clip last night yes yeah oh i 
[01:27:00]  did not know that yeah and also there's another thing i mean it's it's off it i guess it has to do  story with this but uh nugent also brought up uh how the cnn won't even mention or uh name richard  prier's best-selling records you know just because of the memes yes i did a whole blog on that when i  watched the bio channel and they actually blocked out the word nigger in bicentennial nigger and  that nigger's crazy which hey look that that was 75 or 74 and 76 they were two brilliant brilliant 
[01:27:30]  richard prier albums that's what he called them that's what that genius decided to call his records  and taken in context how could you find that offensive so weird crazy all right thank you  the language in this country is just getting ridiculously especially especially i'm sorry  weird since bison bicentennial nigger was sarcastic right and it was a it was it's such it's a  fucking like dripping with contempt and to to take that away because you think it's it's a dirty word

[01:34:30]  he's on the beach oh this is awful why why is it awful i don't relate to their lives  no he pointed at himself when he said the name comes from me oh and the rest of the band is just  walking around yeah in other locales he's looking over like a little sea wall a shitty sea wall now  he's looking at the water they didn't even rate the beach to make it look nicer  oh wow there's somebody walking in the background they can't shut down the beach 
[01:35:00]  they couldn't even clear the shitty beach there's no lighting  no no oh this is bad wow there comes a big car black and white walking through san francisco to  some clouds

[01:39:30]  that white david brent shirt the david brent shirt was fucking great that's live sam we want the  official video at least we'll see him yeah look at how much less fat he was in this wow that happens  tall valkyrie that is going to be stuck in everybody's head  oh god another live version yeah i don't see a video for it maybe there wasn't a video that song  was made for honda's new car the valkyrie supposedly oh boy what are you doing these are all live

[01:40:30]  this doesn't hold up no it doesn't it does  oh he was a lot slimmer much slimmer  remember how bad he was walking on the beach with his hands tucked in his pockets yeah very  fat 
[01:41:00]  he's chubby there too  He is a chopper.  Right.  Big square microphone.  He doesn't go up.  He looks like Biff in the alternative future.  Yes, alternative future Biff.  He wasn't able to hit the high notes back then.  He sucks.  Let's say hi to brother Joe.  It's terrible.  What do you say, Joe?  Hello, Joseph.  I always hated Asia. 
[01:41:30]  I never liked that.  Come on.  For a super group.  They were awful.  Super group.  Rating was terrible.  Super group.  Super group.  Soul Survivor.  Solitary.  Soul Survivor.  You've got to give respect.  If they didn't invent the super group concept, you wouldn't have other super groups.  True.  Exactly.  That's about all.  That's about the only thing that they did that was worthwhile, in my opinion.  But did you guys see U2 on Jimmy Fallon the other night?  I did.  The one where they were on the roof?  The Invisible video, yeah. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  What did you think?  As far as U2 songs go, it's all right.  I like it, but I don't know.  It's missing that cool hook that U2 has been doing lately.  I hope they had a permit to be up there.  All right, Chip.  Calm down.  I think they're screwing up in that they're not taking the right track and putting it  out there.  Invisible, as far as a single, sucks.  There's a song called This Is.  If you get a chance, check it out on YouTube.  It's probably the best thing they've done in the past, I don't know, 20 years. 
[01:42:30]  Better than that.  What?  Big hit.  What was that fucking?  Vertigo.  Vertigo.  Better than Vertigo?  I like that one.  Come on.  Or Elevation.  Elevation!  Woo-hoo-hoo!  Woo-hoo!  Woo-hoo-hoo!  Oh, you guys are good.  Fuck yeah, they're good.  This is real good.  Ordinary Love was all right.  We're in the midst of learning all that crap.  Ah, what are you learning it for, Joe?  Well, Ulysses on the 8th. 
[01:43:00]  Nice.  We're in the city again.  Yeah, downtown.  Invisible, it's all right.  I don't hate it.  I wasn't that impressed.  You know, Bono said one time, he said in an interview, something like, if they have two  bum albums back-to-back, and we know what No Line on the Horizon did, if they have two  bum albums back-to-back, they're going to pack it in.  Really?  Which would probably be the best thing for us.  It would be outstanding for us.  You two, now and forever. 
[01:43:30]  I think they're going to be around for a little longer.  Yeah, I don't see that happening.  I want to hear this.  Stay on the phone, Joe.  It's called This...  What is it called again?  It's a song called This Is.  This Is.  I got it.  This Is Asian cover.  I don't know what that means.  It's recorded at Electric Lady.  They have the Electric Ladyland studio sign in the back.  All right, hold on.  All right, yeah.  You're saying the best thing they've done in 20 years.  Yeah.  Jesus.  I like the song.  I really like the song.  All right, let's hear it.  I like that song. 
[01:44:00]  It's no Valkyrie.  It's Valkyrie.  It's no Valkyrie.  It's no Valkyrie.  It's a bad song.  Oh, man.  What?  Maverick.  Very bad song.  It's not a bad song.  You enjoyed it.  It's fucking...  Valkyrie.  They're still doing it, man.  Thanks.  They're not doing it.  They're still doing it.  32 years later.  Now, that's a song.  And the band is tight as ever.  You can tell by the video.  They're not even in the same state.  That's how tight they are. 
[01:44:30]  They don't need to be on the beach together.  They got things to do.  They know where they're at with their relationships.  They can't even be on the beach together, yeah.  No, man.  That guy's like, look, I'll walk the beach.  You go fucking...  You try to put your drum kit together.  You go to the train.  Yeah, we're good.  You just go to the train, walk around.  We're all good.  And the young kid that wasn't even born when we were actually first playing this stuff,  you just walk down the sidewalk.  Right.  Yeah.  We need some youth in our video.  Yeah, yeah.  They couldn't hire one girl.  They couldn't get one... 
[01:45:00]  There wasn't one chick in the video.  They couldn't get a rake to rake up the seaweed on their shitty beach that they were able to find.  Throw some rocks away.  Right.  That one person wandering in the fucking shot that they had to use.  Who wanders into your camera shot and you don't just redo it?  It has nothing to do with the video.  No, it's good.  It will look like there's things happening.  Right.  They were losing light from the beginning of the video.  Yeah, and then they were like, oh, we lost light.  Well, we're going to shoot anyway.  It doesn't matter.  Finish it.  They gave themselves an hour to film their video as the sun setting. 
[01:45:30]  It was filmed in real time.  What do they call it?  The magic hour.  Yes, the magic hour.  Their new video needed the magic hour of light.  Natural light.  I think that's what it's called in the business.  I don't know.  Joe, where'd you go?  Yeah, I dropped the call.  I'm driving my daughter to school.  I like what this is.  And you know what?  I don't know this album yet.  I'm getting lazy.  I'm a big YouTube fan.  Always have been.  No one on the horizon didn't do what they expected or anyone else expected them to do, 
[01:46:00]  especially with the 360 tour being as large and huge scale.  It just didn't do what everyone thought it would do.  Two songs came off that.  Magnificent and Get On Your Boots.  Those were the only ones that really allowed to play.  And they weren't huge hits.  No, I didn't like Get On Your Boots.  Elevation!  Woo!  We'll be doing Elevation at Ulysses, downtown Manhattan, on March 8th. 
[01:46:30]  Obviously, March is huge for us.  It's St. Patrick's Day.  We're heading down to Fort Lauderdale, playing a whole bunch down around Baltimore, down at  where Looney's, yeah, two times, two different Looney's down in Baltimore on the 17th, on St. Patrick's Day.  But for the local people, the March 8th thing at Ulysses is going to be quite huge.  We've been, like, capacity in that place every time we play it. 
[01:47:00]  Nice.  Roundup, stop down, man.  The band is a thousand times the last time you saw it.  The last time you saw it was probably at B.B. King's, right?  Yeah, I got to see you guys.  It's been way too long.  Joe's U2 band is ridiculously good.  I've been great.  It's unbelievable.  NotU2.com, still video.  NotU2.com, very good.  All right, man.  All right, Joe, we'll see you soon, buddy.  I'll see you Saturday, Ant.  Colt.  There's a Glenn Frey cover band.  They do, like, the solos. 
[01:47:30]  They're, like, get over it.  Oh.  And they're performing in Pittsburgh this Friday.  What?  That's true.  I don't believe that.  It's at the Carnegie Music Hall.  Big bunch of Glenn Frey and Eagle covers.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  I do all the instruments myself.  We got more in Fall on the U2 song that Joe just turned us on to.  Oh.  Sean in Brooklyn.  Go ahead, Sean.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Love the show.  There was a group back in the 80s called Aslan from Ireland, and that was the name of the album and the main song. 
[01:48:00]  Is it the same song, though?  Because sometimes...  Absolutely.  Really?  Absolutely.  I just Googled it.  Yep.  How do you spell the name of the band?  A-S-L-A-N.  A-S-L-A-N.  I've never heard of these guys.  And they have a song...  I want to hear...  So U2's doing a cover.  Yeah.  How do they get away with stealing this song like that?  It's a cover, Sam.  Oh, man. 
[01:48:30]  It's a difference, Sam.  It's a cover.  That's a big difference than just stealing a piece of a song to fill in between going,  Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh.  Let me see this.  Let me...  A little bit.  Okay.  This looks old.  Real old.  They look...  Okay.  85.  Oh. 
[01:49:00]  Everyone did.  85.  It sounds like Bono.  It sounds like Bono.  It's creepy.  What the fuck?  Yeah, that is.  That is.  That is the start.  How fucking weird is this?  That really sounds like... 
[01:49:30]  Oh, I'm a broken lover.  Such and close my age, yeah.  These are the feet of the body.  That sounds a little squeeze-like.  And in this book, I'm a classic girl.  You see it's high.  Sean, thanks, man.  For real.  Got it.  Holy shit.  Sean in Brooklyn with a nice find.  And that was Edge.  I've never heard of these guys. 
[01:50:00]  No one else did either.  That's the same place.  That's pretty wild.  Sounds like Bono for real.  Yeah, there's parts where he definitely sounds like him. 
[01:50:30]  Wow.  I've never heard of Aslan.  A-S-L-A-N.  Is that how you spelled it?  Yeah.  I guess no one else had either.  No kidding.  With 3,000, about 4,000 hits on that song right there.  It's no Valkyrie.  Valkyrie.  What are you laughing at, Jimmy?  It's just nonsense.  Meaning?  There's hashtags.  All the tachos still?  Hashtags are still rolling in.  You should have took it as a nice, fun joke.  Now it will never stop.  Oh, my God. 
[01:51:00]  These are the...  A sucker fish on a guy's couch.  That's a sucker fish.  That's great.  That's a terrible thing.  Someone said the Todd show stinks.  It stinks.  It stinks.  It stinks.  I want to give a shout-out to John Minnelli, who's listening to us these days.  John.  And he was writing about our comments about the Todd show on the New York Radio message board. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, was he?  Oh, yeah.  I think he's in agreement for the most part.  It just sucks that they just recycle the same shitty radio over and over again.  It's amazing to me.  You guys want to run down the 20 greatest supergroups of all time?  Oh, God.  Are there 20?  Why?  Why wouldn't you want to do that?  Are there 20?  Yes, of course there are 20.  They're can't be.  Terrible.  What?  All right, rounding out the top two. 
[01:52:00]  There can't be.  It's snowing in D.C.  It's Guitar Magazine.  Is it snowing again?  It's snowing in D.C.  Come on.  So, I don't know what that means for our area.  It's Guitar World, I guess.  Mac underscore tampa on Twitter just sent this to me.  Guitarworld.com.  The 20 greatest supergroups of all time.  What's wrong?  I bet they're not going to be supergroups.  Why?  I go, like, why is that a supergroup?  What defines a supergroup? 
[01:52:30]  I think you have to have a couple of people from other bands come together and have a hit song.  What's wrong, Sam?  Number 19 is Blue Murder.  Who the fuck is that?  What about number 20?  I don't know.  Who the fuck are you?  Who's number 20?  He started with 19.  Bucky Denton.  No, go backwards.  There you go.  Chickenfoot is 20.  Chickenfoot is 20.  There you go.  Sammy Hagar. 
[01:53:00]  And Michael Anthony, right?  It's Van Halen.  That's Van Halen.  Yeah.  Just went to other guys.  All right.  Keep going.  It's not a supergroup.  I say no to supergroup.  Blue Murder?  Blue Murder with the vocal debut of Whitesnake guitarist John Sykes.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  Then he ran an infinity broadcast?  Yeah.  What happened?  He didn't understand WOW was his first meeting with us.  We're going to have to do something about this WOW thing.  I'll never forget.  Are we?  Yeah.  God forbid we get your fucking radio station logo on every car in the New York City area. 
[01:53:30]  How come in his hands?  Not every car, but...  Oh, yeah.  Damn Yankees.  Yes.  Ted Nugent.  Damn Yankees.  We got a little sticks in there.  A little of everybody.  What else do we got?  A little taste from a bunch of people.  What are the buzzers in there?  A Night Ranger.  Of course.  Night Ranger.  And, uh...  Sticks.  Ted Nugent.  Michael Carteloni.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  On drums.  Keep going.  All right.  This doesn't have to take forever.  Them Crooked Vultures, of course. 
[01:54:00]  Yes, of course.  Keep going.  Okay.  Free Fighters.  Black County Communion.  What?  Mm-hmm.  That's like shit to me.  If Asia's not number one, I'm going to flip shit.  Asia's got to be number one.  Oysterhead.  Oysterhead, of course.  Primus and Fish.  Yep.  Oh, boy.  The Highwaymen.  Johnny Cash.  Willie Nelson.  Willie Nelson.  Chris Christopherson.  Waylon Jennings.  And Waylon.  That's a super group.  That's a big band.  That's a badass super group right there.  Not the first.  Mr. Big.  Remember Mr. Big?  Oh, my God.  Mr. Big.  Who is it, Mr. Big? 
[01:54:30]  Um, the band included, uh, Billy Sheehan.  Yep.  From David Lee Roth.  Uh, Paul Gilbert.  Uh, from Racer X.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, Eric Martin.  And...  Jerry Sherbert.  No.  Pat Torpey.

Yeah, Phil from Pantera.  Yep.  Temple of the Dog.  Yes, huge super group.  All right. 
[01:55:00]  That could be considered a super group.  10.  Perfect circle.  Perfect circle.  Yes.  You got a Smashing Pokens dude in there.  Uh-huh.  Asia's number nine.  Oh, fuck.  Man.  Oh, fuck.  And it doesn't even say in the description...  In the description...  Description.  Yeah, it doesn't even say that they're the first...  They didn't want to insult everybody else.  That's crazy.  They weren't just the first to do it?  Yeah.  You don't like that they're number nine?  No.  Get over it!  Shit.  They're very old.  They didn't want to rub it in, you know.  Everyone just knows they were the first super group.  Look at this asshole. 
[01:55:30]  Look how old he is.  He looks weird.  He's the one that was wandering the streets.  He's the freaky looking guitarist guy.  All right.  Go ahead.  The Firm.  Better than Asia?

I hated King Crimson.  Greg Abelson.  Greg Abelson was in that band.  And Mott the Hoople guy.  Oh, man.  Well, I didn't know Bad Company was a super group.  We learned something.  Let's finally learn something.  Number two.  Number two.  Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young.  Ah, Crosby, Stills.

They were popular.  Again, Clapton, Ginger Baker, but then who are the other guys?  Well, nobody's really.  Jack Bruce.  Oh, Jack Bruce.  And Fred Appleton, I think, was in this one, too.  I have major problems with this list.  Well, what's the first problem? 
[01:58:30]  Asia should be number one.  Asia should be number one.  For inventing the concept.  Valkyrie.  Valkyrie.  Valkyrie.  That song stinks.  Yeah, it's not good.  It's so bad.  As opposed to good.  We have time for Hulk Hogan before the break.  Yeah.  Before we get ready for Robert Rodriguez.  A lot of excitement last night.  So, Hulk Hogan has made his return to the WWE.  What the fuck is the WWE doing?  I don't know.  How long do you think he's going to be around for? 
[01:59:00]  Well, he's coming back for WrestleMania.  You think the Ultimate Warrior will be back?  You must have been psyched, Sam.  To fight him?  I don't know if they'll fight, but the Warrior's going in the Hall of Fame this year.  Oh, God.  The Hall of Fame.  For what?  Are you still a Hulkamaniac?  In my heart, I am.  Remember when the Warrior's makeup would all come off at the end of the match?  That's how you know it was a hard-fought matchup.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, but Hogan, based on the promo that he did last night, he did nothing. 
[01:59:30]  And he's obviously just back to push the network.  Yeah, but it's so weird the way he responded when they complained.  What did he say?  Get over it!  Oh, fuck.  Maybe we should tell the Todd Show to get over it.  Yeah, exactly.  Instead of really being vicious.  The hashtag, the Todd Show, is still going strong.  Oh, yeah.  We haven't forgotten.  We just got to move on to other things for now.  That's making me laugh a lot.  I know.  They're just coming in a lot still, huh?  Oh.  Let's see the big return of Hulk Hogan last night. 
[02:00:00]  I am a little worried that they're going to move this into him wrestling again.  Do you think he should?  No.  Why?  He's beat up.  You could see him when he's walking.  He's broken, right?  His knees are all fucked up.  His back is destroyed.  His leg dropped.  Yeah.  Make it big, Sam.  That's the return of Hulk Hogan.  Did they know he was coming?  This was a big deal last night.  Oh, he's got his song.  Look at him.  He's doing his dumb shit.  Hulk still rules.  He's got the feather bowie. 
[02:00:30]  He's doing the ear thing.  Hulk rules.  Look at Hulk.  He's got his bleach blonde extensions in.  Yes.  He's doing the little hand to the ear.  Is he going to tear his shirt off?  No.  Why?  He doesn't tear the shirt off.  No.  That's not good.  You think it'd be funny if he started flubbing his words a little bit in the middle of the  problem?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  He didn't do that, did he?  Wait.  What are some of the...  What's this song?  This song's terrible.  That's his song.  It's real American. 
[02:01:00]  I am a real American fighting for the rights of every man.  Yeah.  I am a real American.  It says, you got to take a stand.  It don't hurt to hide.  It's a good song, but it's no Valkyrie.  That's true.  There should be a wrestler named Valkyrie.  I can't wait to see him do a big angry promo.  The rips in the back of his shirt.  It is electric.  The stairs up to the ring have one of those little seats with the motorized.  He comes around to get into the ring.  Like Tony Soprano's mom used to. 
[02:01:30]  Exactly.  I love Jim.  He's in the ring.  Oh, my God.  This is where he tears his shirt off.  You're saying he's not going to tear the shirt off.  Hulk does.  Oh, yeah.  By the way, Mr. Oh, my God is in here on Friday.  Oh, wow.  That's true.  Yeah.  He's using a hurricane.  It stands up on its own.  He did get a big standing ovation, didn't he? 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  When Hogan returns today, it's a big deal.  How long has he been gone?  I think five years or so.  Are they going to play the clip when he cries because he can't see his doggie from the boat?  Glasses.  It looks very 80s.  It does, doesn't it?  Thunder lips.  Thunder lips.  Yes.  Ray bear.  How much of this song are they going to play? 
[02:02:30]  Everybody's done clapping.  It's a standing o.  They're sitting already.  They are, aren't they?  They're relaxed.  They're out playing a program.  You don't think that's his real blonde hair hanging out of the back of his do-rag?  Look at the Barbie hair hanging out of his bandana.  Barbie hair.  It really is.  So he's there to celebrate the launch of the WWE Network.  Ah, the Network.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  I hope he doesn't start talking a bunch of smack. 
[02:03:00]  Uh-oh.  Well, let me tell you something, brother.  Brother.  Whoa.  And then he stops to get the applause break.  To get the applause for saying, let me tell you something, brother.  Everyone.  That's his catchphrase, though.  Is he going to do the read for Renna Center here?  Does he do that?  No?  I'm telling everyone all around the world in the WWE Universe, and especially as my witness.  Hulkamania.  Right here at Green Bay. 
[02:03:30]  Hazard's turn.  Yeah, brother.  Brother.  That tonight marks the turning point of my career.  Oh, really?  I am officially home, brothers.  Oh, he stumbled.  You know, 30 years ago.  Oh, boy.  I was part of something very, very special.  A marriage.  Something that turned into a global phenomenon.  It was the first ever WrestleMania.  Oh, I remember that. 
[02:04:00]  The applause is getting less.  Yeah, right.  I don't care.  You know, history was made that day.  And history's being made right now with the launch of the WWE Network.  That's why history is being made right here with everybody in the WWE Universe.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, wow.  That's so funny.  They edited this.  This must be an international feed of it.  Oh, no.  Oh, really?  Because last night he came out and said, with the launch of the WWE Universe.  Because the WWE Universe is launching the WWE Network, which is being launched by the 
[02:04:30]  Universe.  Ew.  No way.  We've got to find that clip.  Yeah, this must be an international life.  Oh, Sam.  This was your only job.  Oh, Sam.  This is it.  It's the only reason we're playing this.  Well, he continues.  The applause are really getting low now.  Yeah, yeah.  They're just waiting for the next match.  They really don't want to hear this.  Who's fighting next?  It was like, all right, that was fun for two minutes.  How fickle.  That was fighting.  They give him this giant ovation.  He starts talking and they're like, yeah. 
[02:05:00]  Maybe the Hulkster wasn't all that great.  They thought there was going to be like a storyline happening or he was going to call somebody  out or something.  Right, right.  Yeah, you and me got to wrestle this out.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, brother.  Someone should come running down the ramp, dive under the ropes and just tackle him and  start pounding him in the face.  And then people would be like, ah.  But he's like, just, you know, and make sure you pick up your action figures.  You're right.  You're right, exactly.  You're right, exactly.  You're right, exactly.  You're right, exactly.  You're right, exactly.  Yes.  Yes.  Dot com.  All right, we don't have to play the rest of it. 
[02:05:30]  Is there anything else in here?  Yeah, I mean, it's the Hulkster.  Oh, I don't hear the Hulkster.  And I'm proud to say my Hulkamaniacs were a huge part of helping launch the W.A.D.  You're Hulkamaniacs are 40 years old now.  Is he rock a Hulkamaniac?  Oh, big time.  Oh, yeah.  I've been walking around like a proud Papa Jack.  Did he see this?  Yeah.  He's out of breath already.  And the future of the WWE is going to be immortalized.  Immortalized.  I can watch great matches with a little bit of a legend. 
[02:06:00]  He is out of breath.  Yeah.  I can watch the heartbreak kid, Shawn Michaels.  He's just chilling.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  What about Bob Backlund?  I can watch the rock, Jack.  Ooh.  Oh.  But the most important thing is the then and the now and the future of the WWE Network.  Oof. 
[02:06:30]  Bad, right?  And the future of the WWE Network is WrestleMania 30, brother.  Everybody's just trying to applaud because he's the Hulkster.  Every time he stops, it's the turning point of my career.  Is it?  Can he watch the Macho Man?  No.  Oh.  Why not?  Macho Man's dead.  Oh.  These fucking mutants. 
[02:07:00]  No.  I know what it's going to be.  Oh.  And WrestleMania 30 runs wild on you, brother.  Oh.  Damn.  Oh, now he flexes.  Do you think he knows that stunk?  Now he flexes and he does his hand thing to the ear. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, this music is terrible.  That was fun.  Do you think he knows that stunk?  Come on.  No, I think he probably thinks it was awesome.  Da, da, da.  He went backstage and they were like, man, they loved you, Hulk.  I want to hear the flubs.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  You want to hear the flubs.  I just got a Hulk.  They loved you, Terry.  What a great job.  They loved you, Terry.  Just like the old days.  Yeah.  You know, brother, it felt like the old days out there.  You know, and I saw my little dog from the boat at a house I couldn't even stop at. 
[02:08:00]  You enjoyed that?  I loved it.  I basked in it.  It's one of the greatest quests.  It's fantastic.  They weren't allowed to touch a dog or you'd be breaking some fucking wall.  Hey, Sam, so the WWE Network, you can just see all these old matches and wrestlers, right?  Fuck yes.  For example, like, I don't know, Chris Benoit.  You can now just see all his great matches on the WWE Network. 
[02:08:30]  That's kind of cool.  Should we, I think they're going to include him?  I don't know.  Did you join already, Sam?  Oh, yeah, dude.  I was watching it all day yesterday.  Your whole collection is fucking shit.  That's it.  All your videos now mean nothing.  Why would you watch all day?  No, I wouldn't watch ever.  Look at this.  Look at what it is.  We just turned on the network and they're showing the Shockmaster.  The Shockmaster.  We're not going to watch this all day.  Oh, you can't find what you want?  No, it's both.  It's a live network and it's... 
[02:09:00]  Let's watch the Shockmaster.  Control his bedazzled Stormtrooper helmet.  This just happens to be on right now.  Come on, you want a picture, baby?  See you at the Fall Brawl.  I'm killing.  Wait.  It's just a glittery...  That's what he looked like after.  The shocking one stumbled out of WCW for good a short time lately.  Oh, man.  What a bomb.  ...hasn't faded away one bit.  In 2009, the Shockmaster got a tribute of sorts from DX. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, whoa.  That makes it real.  That's a pretty good recreation.  Do you think that was embarrassing when it happened?  Oh, gosh.  It killed his whole thing.  That was great.  It killed his entire gimmick.  Do you think wrestlers like that clip?  They love it.  Oh, have you talked to anybody in the business about the Shockmaster?  The Shockmaster.  The Shockmaster was great. 
[02:10:00]  I want to see it again.  I'm sorry to the audience.  I know you're tired of me.  Oh, what?  Chris Benoit, where is he?  No results were found.  Well, he gets spelt Benoit.  That's how it's spelled.  Oh.  Wait, they just...  Why wouldn't they have him in there, though?  They have him.  I think it's just not searchable.  Try this.  Try this.  They wiped him from the history of the WWE.  Put in M.  M.  U.  No.  R.  R.  D.  Okay, D-R-E-R.  Oh, I know what that spells.  What?  Oh, I'm not...  They don't have it. 
[02:10:30]  It smells mudda.  Oh, see.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, no, they have him on there, but you can't...  Shockmaster.  Oh, look at this, dude.  You can get all the Shockmaster's magic.  Wow.  Look at all the Shockmaster stuff there is.  What do you got, Eric?  You came in.  Hey, Rock, you got this?  I guess you can't search for Chris Benoit, but anything that does have him in it has a disclaimer  at the beginning of it.  That this guy's an asshole?  Right here.  For killing his family?  Yeah.  This guy killed his family, and we don't condone killing of your family.  The following program is presented in its original form. 
[02:11:00]  It may contain some content that does not reflect...  That's every program.  ...but it also has the channel blocking thing, specifically on the stuff that he's in.  Oh.  I played, like, the ECW stuff, which is sex, violence, whatever, and it doesn't have the disclaimer.  You have the right to just block it.  Wait, have you already joined up for this network?  As soon as they took my credit card, yes.  Oh, wow.  Have you been watching wrestling?  I watched a little bit of it yesterday.  It hasn't worked for the Xbox yet.  I think it's going to be today.  Are you going to watch it?  Yeah, I was watching some on my phone yesterday. 
[02:11:30]  How does this launch fine, but fucking Obama's dumb healthcare site just fucking crashing?  Still has problems.  You can get every Shockmaster match, and that's fine.  That's no problem.  Yeah.  Amazing.  The government.  You can get the best of the Red Rooster if you want.  Oh, wow.  Can you find Hulk Hogan fucking up last night?  Because they edited that video.  Did you like Hulk's return, Eric?  Of course.  Of course.  He was so shill.  You know, if you remember.  Just shilling.  He's one of his heroes. 
[02:12:00]  Right.  It is.  How do you not get goosebumps when that music hits?  I get douche chills.  Douche chills, you mean?  I'm a real American.  I'm a real American.  Have you watched him wrestle in person, Eric?  Yeah, during his last run.  How good was he?  You didn't see him when he was in his prime.  Nah.  Can he still get that leg up?  No, he doesn't do the leg drop.  Why would he?  It sucks.  The leg drop's awful.  He's very stiff.  Big fat leg on someone.  Leg off.  He does the high kick where he throws someone into the ropes, and then as they're running 
[02:12:30]  back, he lifts his leg up.  Worst move ever.  He doesn't really hit in the face where he used to.  Yeah.  It's just like it hits the side.  Yeah.  It hits the gut, and you pretend he hit you in the head.  You mean when they throw against the ropes?  I used to love when they would run back and forth and cross each other and cross the ropes.  Good news, guys.  Oh, good.  It was edited.  This is how Hulk actually saw it last night.  Okay, let's hear.  Global phenomenon.  The first ever WrestleMania.  You know, history was made that day, and history's being made right now with the launch of the 
[02:13:00]  WWE Universe.  The WWE Universe has now launched the WWE Network.  That's why history is being made right here with everybody in the WWE Universe.  The Universe.  The Universe.  The Universe.  The Universe and the Network.  Oh.  Oh, he covered. 
[02:13:30]  He covered well.  The Uniwork.  Whoops.  He got himself out of it.  You didn't see that one, did you, Iraq?  Yeah, that was last night.  That was the first thing on Raw.  Oh.  That's how they started the show.  That was exciting, huh?  He flubbed.  Look at all the Bob Backlund stuff.  Look at it.  If you want to see hours of Bob Backlund.  Can we see Chief J. Strongbow and somebody else running across the ring?  That dumb sound of them running.  Duk, duk, duk, duk.  Bounce.  Duk, duk, duk, duk.  Bounce.  Crossing each other.  Chief J. Strongbow.  That was so stupid.  Dunk.  Why couldn't he line up his move properly?  I don't know.  They keep missing each other. 
[02:14:00]  So frustrating.  Did you like Chief J. Strongbow, Sam?  No.  I enjoyed him when I was a kid.  You liked him?  Yeah.  He was one of the greats.  Do the Indian dance?  Yep.  I mean, he was, you know, a little old.  Tomahawk fucking thing.  There you go.  Plenty of Chief J. Strongbow matches.  Nice.  Chief J. Strongbow versus Paul the Butcher Vachon.  There's four matches.  I haven't scrolled down yet.  Andre the Giant versus Chief J.  Yeah.  That's crazy.  That's some Chief J when he's doing the Indian thing.  Running around.  Fucking.  Yeah, go to the Andre the Giant one.  Can I ask what this costs?  And just go right in the middle of the video. 
[02:14:30]  $10 a month.  $10 a month.  And you get all the live pay-per-views for free.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa, motherfucker.  So it's worthwhile.  That ain't bad.  That ain't bad.  That ain't bad.  Robert Rodriguez is here.  Robert Rodriguez is here, so fuck you when you're wrestling.  We were supposed to take a break before Robert Rodriguez.  What time is it?  Too late now, right?  It's not time to bring him in.  Too late now.  I'm going to pee.  I'm going to pee, too.  What?  Wait.  If you leave, I leave.  I'm not leaving.  Take us one, no?  Should we take a quick break so we can pee?  Take a single, then?  I'll be all right.  It's a single.  Quick break. 
[02:15:00]  For real.  Robert Rodriguez next.  Leave your penis alone.  The Opie and Anthony Show is back on.  Got Robert Rodriguez making his way into the studio.  Yeah, get him on.  Come on in, Robert.  Come on in.  That neutral bullet.  I'm throwing it out.  Hey, there he is.  What's up, Robert?  Take a seat. 
[02:15:30]  How are you?  Right there.  How you been?  It's been a while, man.  Yeah.  I haven't seen you in a while.  You've been busy.  A little bit, right?  You're a working guy.  Working writer, director, editor, music guy, everything else.  How did you launch a network?  Man, it was tough.  It was actually a really great opportunity that came up.  I was doing my movies, and then there was an opportunity. 
[02:16:00]  Comcast had a network that was up for grabs, and I went and put a pitch in for this network,  and we got it.  Wow, that just seems like a pitch in for a network.  It seems like a lot of work.  Who wants to work that hard?  It's fun.  It's fun.  Is it?  Yeah.  You have a direct pipeline right to the audience.  Exactly.  What's your vision for it?  What are you going to include?  Well, I wanted the network to be just built from the ground up and be really curated.  So we have, like Quentin called me the other day, and he said, man, I was looking for something  to tape, and I thought, who's showing Starsky and Hutch? 
[02:16:30]  And I looked, it was your network.  And then tonight, I hadn't seen that in forever.  Then tonight, I'm taping all of them.  And then tonight, my favorite two Kung Fu movies are on, Avenging Eagle and Chinese Boxer.  So yeah, we had a bunch of cool stuff coming up, a bunch of grindhouse films, a bunch of  movies that were classics of the genre that people don't really give a lot of love to,  and really highlight them and really educate people on what they are.  So everything you turn on the network for, it's, you know, that people love, actually  from the network, love that stuff.  It's not just sitting there.  When we talked to Quentin, he talked about his movie nights and stuff. 
[02:17:00]  And it kind of sounds like the stuff that would be played at his house on those movie nights.  Yeah.  Anything that we used to go and string up a 16 millimeter and watch and go point out where  these other movies came from, it started with this one.  You know, that's the kind of stuff we're showing because it's not expensive, but that  becomes your brand identities that you're telling people about these classic shows, cinematic  television series that you're always fans of.  Like we have X-Files and Starsky and Hutt, Jim Cameron's Dark Angel right now. 
[02:17:30]  And then, you know, classic films, cool films, grindhouse films, rarities.  And we're going to have a double feature of Mariachi and Reservoir Dogs, our first film,  you know, coming up pretty soon.  Nice.  Yeah.  And then From Dusk Till Dawn, launching From Dusk Till Dawn, the series.  The series.  Yeah.  What's this about?  Quentin's never been on television.  You know, I've never done television.  And we kind of held this back because we didn't really want people doing our shows on television  unless we were really heavily involved, which probably never would be. 
[02:18:00]  But when you got your own network, then it's kind of like, oh, there's no interference.  You know, you can just go make it however you want and whatever you think it needs to  be and put it and let the audience decide, not a bunch of executives.  So it's really, you know, it's kind of cool.  Really awesome.  Yeah.  So you just think, got an idea, let's put it on the network, try it.  The audience digs it, we'll keep it on.  If not, we'll try something else.  It's called El Rey, it's like Spanish speaking or is it just aimed at a Latin audience?  It's English language, but it's aimed, I mean, it's, I want it to be sort of like an English 
[02:18:30]  language, Hispanic network, but much in the way that when you see Desperado or Dusk Till  Dawn or Spy Kids or Sin City or Machete, those are Latin films, but you don't think of them  as that way because they're for everybody to watch.  That's kind of what the network is.  Isn't that where the Gecko Brothers were going?  They were going to Mexico, so that kind of draws, you know, they're going to El Rey.  Yeah, yeah, okay.  It's called the El Rey network.  It's this mythical destination that Joyce dreamed about.  Yeah.  And they're trying to find all the time, well, now it's here.  Oh, that's cool.  How is the series going to work? 
[02:19:00]  Because obviously in the movie, well, let's just say they don't both make it.  We took the movie and Quentin just has the best characters.  I mean, you could populate the entire series with these characters and just have them riff  in their way.  And those characters were so memorable that rather than just do a new story, I thought,  let's relaunch that story and retell it in a completely different way.  The whole season takes place from dusk till dawn.  So it only, you know, it happens very fast.  And it's relentless.  It's about 10 episodes. 
[02:19:30]  And it retells stories with its characters in a completely different way.  There's new characters that get added.  Different things happen to the characters you remember.  So it doesn't turn out the way you remember.  Okay, but it is that same dusk till dawn, that same night day.  It's that same night with different things happening.  And you're seeing outside of the Titty Twister other places that are happening.  Oh, okay.  It takes about half the season to actually get to the bar.  There's a lot more story involved. 
[02:20:00]  Did you have a little better luck with the set this time?  We had a great time with the set.  Did not burn down this time.  The last time it burned down or something.  It was really trippy to go back to that set and re-stage things so that anyone who's  a fan of the film will be surprised by what happens to who and how.  And then about halfway through the season, it turns into new territory because it's really  to reset it up for the next seasons that come and have a much deeper mythology into the  sort of Mayan cult of this vampire-type cult that we have. 
[02:20:30]  And you got a series onto your own network.  How do you get a network onto different cable outlets?  Like, Oprah even had trouble making her network kind of known.  And how do you get it from, like, now it's on Time Warner, but now it's going to be on  DirecTV.  And how do you get it on these things?  Well, it started as being naive helps a lot.  I mean, it started with a Comcast network.  And then I could take it around as, like, a business and go to Time Warner and go to  Dish and go to, you know, DirecTV and sell it to them.  And that was going to take some time.  But Univision saw that we were doing an English-language Hispanic network and said they wanted to be 
[02:21:00]  in that business.  So they invested in us and brought with them their distribution, which they're distributed  everywhere.  So we'll eventually be in every place that they are.  But this year we'll be in 40 million homes.  Jesus, good for you.  That's pretty awesome.  Righteous.  So, yeah, people, that's why Quentin called me.  He didn't even know he had me on his network, I mean, on his cable service.  People might just go check because they probably already have it.  Right, yeah, yeah.  Because it's on the first tier of a basic cable. 
[02:21:30]  So it's pretty exciting.  So that's kind of why I wanted to launch Dust Till Dawn, because I thought that would be  a name that people recognize.  Exactly.  They would come look for it and discover the network, and then they would now have a connection  to us and see all the other programming we're putting on.  With Clooney and Tarantino doing the Gecko Brothers in the movie, what was kind of your criteria  for casting for the show?  Did you want them to kind of be like them or a little departed?  They just needed to have that star quality.  You know, we had to go really big with the casting. 
[02:22:00]  So everyone was so fantastic in that film.  It set the bar really high, which was really exciting to go take that on.  Even the small peripheral players were just fantastic.  The poor son of a bitch in the liquor store.  What's his name?  Because he's great.  Michael Parks plays Earl Brown.  Well, yeah, he's the guy behind the counter.  Oh, yeah, that's John Hawks.  He ended up in an Oscar.  He wound up in so much stuff after that.  And every time I see him still, I go, hey, it's the guy behind the counter in Dusk Till Dawn. 
[02:22:30]  He was a kid from Austin for a long time.  Yeah.  The guy who plays the sheriff in the Texas Ranger, Earl McGraw, that was Michael Parks.  Right.  That's now Don Johnson.  Don Johnson, yeah.  And you get DJ Katrona as Seth Gekko, who's also someone who was right on the brink of stardom.  And he came and did this for us.  Found an amazing girl to play the Salma Hayek character.  I mean, they were just big shoes to fill.  No shit, yeah.  And Robert Patrick to play the Harvey Gattel role.  Oh, wow.  That's a great idea.  They ran the roles, and they get to do so much more than in the movie. 
[02:23:00]  And it's freaking cool to see.  Do you have any, not restrictions, but as far as language content, you just do whatever?  Well, yeah.  I think every network kind of has their own guidelines.  And I have mine written around here somewhere.  Where's my guidelines?  Well, it's cable, so you can technically do what you want.  It's just self-imposed for advertisers.  Well, in the movie, you had, you know, obviously nudity and some good language in there.  Yeah. 
[02:23:30]  This is day and age of, like, Walking Dead and stuff.  You know, genre stuff like this, you can kind of do a lot.  Yeah, that's true.  I just thought we're showing you some high express that we don't need to see that.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a commercial.  That hurt the film.  One of the greatest, one of the greatest dance scenes ever in that one.  Oh, my God.  That's amazing.  How great is it to not have to worry about ratings?  Like, you want it to do well, but it's your network.  So it's like, if it takes a little while to get going, you don't have to cancel it.  You tell that to, we're bringing Bob Borsi, he's doing a show for us next.  He had sort of an espionage-type show. 
[02:24:00]  He pitched me.  He does, you know, Transformers and Star Trek, and he has Sleepy Hollow on right now.  But even he had trouble, you know, with networks.  He had already done two pilots that hadn't gotten picked up.  That's a big problem.  You know, a lot of networks order a lot of pilots to be made.  They'll pick two to go to series.  Everything else dies.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So I'm going to say, hey, you can pitch me your idea for a show.  If I like it, you get 13 episodes, prime time guaranteed, and this about a money for each episode.  And we start now.  And that's just fantastic, because they have a show, and they're doing a full show and nothing less than that. 
[02:24:30]  Are you going to use focus groups and stuff?  That's where the networks go wrong, is they'll get a focus group to watch something, and the focus groups make these really shitty or weird or knee-jerk reactions, and the network listens to them, and they wreck what could be amazing projects.  Well, I think that's the idea of just having this direct pipeline to the audience, is that we'll just try it.  You know, we'd rather just be experimental.  That's one of the best shows on TV.  You can tell are the oddities that you want to know how they even got through.  That's all we're going to make are things that you'll wonder how they got through.  Yeah, yeah.  And play it to the audience, and let them decide if it's something we really believe in, and people haven't caught on to it yet, we'll just keep it on if we believe in it. 
[02:25:00]  Do you put much credence in social media and stuff?  Do you check it and see what people are thinking about your work?  Yeah, I think this is something that people are going to want to talk about, because it's just such a different experience.  To have a network that is not built up by people with spreadsheets and business degrees, it's actually from filmmakers who really love this content, or fans of it.  There's an authenticity to that that I think audiences are going to like, and want to tell each other about it. 
[02:25:30]  I mean, because I've seen it already.  I tweet what we're going to be showing, and people are saying they're DVRing, and I can't believe there's a tribute to Sonny Chiba on.  And it's just like, hey, this is heaven.  This is a really cool place.  How do people find it?  Is it going to be easier with Xbox and all these talking?  Because I want to find networks on Fios, and I can't find them.  I'm wondering if it's going to be easier when you can just say, hey, Xbox Go 2, or whatever the fuck it is, and say Elray, and it will just take you there.  So you won't have to know where it is.  Because it's hard to find, especially in new channels. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, we're looking into how to do that with these other systems.  I mean, we're on right now.  Comcast, Time Warner, DirecTV, Cox Communications, and others are coming.  Yeah, what else is there?  I mean, there's Fios.  Most of them.  Yeah, you've got the big one.  I've got the damn Fios.  I've got to get it.  Son of a bitch.  Call your cable operator.  Call the cable provider.  Quick.  Cable provider.  Before March 11th.  Call them, damn it.  Now, are you going to be good with Netflix and all that stuff?  Because a lot of these networks don't want to do anything with Netflix.  HBO is too territorial that there's stuff to have HBO Go. 
[02:26:30]  Are you going to have your own app and all that shit to be able to watch stuff on?  Am I asking you a question that's two years down the road?  No, no.  We're trying to figure all that out right now.  But we're having deals that might be going pretty quickly with those that we'll announce.  But we're still working on those.  He's giving us this great creative description, and I go, what is the app going to be?  I'm a fucking idiot.  You know, it's more important than, you know, you're right on it.  People want to consume things their own way, and you've got to be there ready to give it  to them that way.  Your career has seemed to have been like this.  You get an idea and just dive right in and do it. 
[02:27:00]  It's not you, Jimmy.  God damn you.  Somebody always said, yeah, I don't think he knows he's not supposed to be able to do  these things.  He just goes and does it.  And you kind of figure out, oh, I didn't realize it was a big deal.  Have you pulled back on doing that at all?  Obviously not with the network.  You dove right in.  But is it harder now when you have stuff to lose or you don't want a failure?  Yeah.  I mean, you really, one of my favorite quotes is, I think Winston Churchill, success is 
[02:27:30]  moving from one failure to the next with great enthusiasm.  So you kind of seek out those times when you have an idea.  Like when this network came up, my hand went up and someone said, do you want this network?  My hand went up.  And I'm trying to put it down.  Hey, what do you want that for?  It's going to be so much trouble.  You know how much work that's going to be?  But the fear is really kind of what makes you keep moving forward.  If you fear your next step, you know you're probably on the right track because otherwise  you'd get too comfortable.  And you figure it out.  You figure it all out as you go. 
[02:28:00]  You're never going to have all the answers up front.  And most interesting things happen.  And I know nothing else I'll learn from the experience and it'll take me a different  route on the next endeavor or idea that I only could have got there had I gone through  that failure.  There is this weird kind of dichotomy of you don't want to fail and lose something, but  you want to keep moving forward.  Yeah.  So you're like, and then the more you get, the more you have to lose.  So you don't, might not take the chances that'll bring you that next big success. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  You kind of fall into this complacency.  You're going to be willing to lose stuff, you know?  Yeah.  You think you're going to lose, you might lose something, but you'll always gain so much  more.  You're getting a knowledge and experience that you never would have had.  Knowledge and experience while you're eating fucking wheat thins and cheddar cheese is  a little different.  Yeah.  Oh, that wasn't fun.  But it's fucking tempting to not do it though.  It's so much easier just to fantasize about it.  It really is.  Yeah.  And go, okay, when I have this perfect picture of how it's going to be and everything, all those  answers are lined up and it's safe, then I'll do it. 
[02:29:00]  And by that point, you know, it's, you're still looking at VHS cassettes and everybody's  on fucking, you know, on Netflix or somewhere else.  I missed it early on with Robert also, you know, just directing, writing it, editing, doing  the music yourself.  And the point is, yeah, you're not supposed to do it that way.  It's supposed to be a team effort.  And you still have a team.  It's just, everybody's like you.  They're all doing multiple jobs.  So the crew's smaller.  It's always very fun.  You know, whenever I would talk to a director, they would get so excited about talking about 
[02:29:30]  their first film because that's when they didn't have enough time, enough, not enough  money.  Everyone had to pull together.  Yeah.  Their eyes light up.  And I said, man, let's just make every movie like that.  Yeah.  Make everyone like it's our first one.  And we don't have enough time.  We don't have enough money.  We all have to do multiple jobs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's so exciting.  It's so vital.  And it makes you want to do it again and again.  Yeah.  The enthusiasm that comes with those early successes, hard to recapture.  Well, even in From This Till Dawn, I mean, I already directed the movie.  So you'd figure maybe I'll direct the pilot of this one.  And then there's 10 episodes.  And they shoot really fast. 
[02:30:00]  They're really hard.  You usually have revolving directors.  Oh, okay.  I've directed half the season already.  You did?  Wow.  In episode eight because it's so fun.  It's so fun.  And I'm writing, directing, editing.  Operating the camera, operating the Steadicam, doing music.  Of course.  Doing the stills even because there's no money to hire a stills photographer on a television series every day.  So rather than miss the great shots, all the posters and things you see.  And those are things that I show.  Does that concern the actors at all? 
[02:30:30]  Like when they're like, for continuity, could you just take a selfie?  Make sure we got it right.  Everybody takes a selfie.  This sounds great.  I'm psyched to check out the series.  When does it start?  It starts March 11th.  March 11th.  Yeah.  And it's awesome.  It really came out cool.  It feels like feature films.  We really shot the hell out of it.  It sounds good.  You have such a great look to your movies and whatever you do. 
[02:31:00]  You're one of those directors that you can watch it and go, oh yeah, that's Rodriguez.  You could tell.  I don't want to say how do you do that, but did you notice that you were putting a brand new, kind of a unique look on your movies?  It's a lot of why I operate the camera and do the cinematography.  And you just see things a certain way.  And certain actors a certain way.  A lot of the actors, I shot them really iconically so that they would become stars for a particular reason. 
[02:31:30]  Like George Clooney, you really couldn't see him on his TV show when he was on ER.  And I met him.  I go, oh my God, they're shooting you with wide lenses.  You're way in the back.  We're going to put you front and center.  I'm going to get you with a 65 millimeter lens.  That's your lens.  I'm going to shoot you from down here.  Down lower.  So it's up.  The audience is just on their knees staring at you.  You're so powerful over the screen.  And it transforms, you know, someone's appearance.  Yeah.  Subliminally, it takes over the audience's mind.  So you want that for everybody.  All the actors want that experience when they come to the set. 
[02:32:00]  So they can tell.  I'm dropping down low.  Make me a star.  They're like, all right, here we go.  This is giving me a lens.  What's a 65 millimeter?  What does that mean?  65 millimeter is a certain type of lens that does something to the background.  For you, I'd probably put you on a 75 and drop back a little further.  Give me that Clint Eastwood look.  Give you that blend into the fucking mushrooms quality.  Drop back to Cleveland. 
[02:32:30]  Poor Jimmy.  No, I've heard that used before.  Like, get the 50.  I don't know what the difference is.  You get a short depth of field on that.  You get a different kind of look at it for different lenses.  If someone comes up to you and they've got a wide lens and they're two feet away, you know they're going to make you look goofy.  But you drop back and you use a longer lens and suddenly your neck looks thicker.  You look like an action star and suddenly you're Bruce Willis.  Oh, okay.  Another great feature about doing the music yourself and everything is the subtle music stings with a turn of the head or something. 
[02:33:00]  That brings the scene.  It just pops it.  So music's really important.  It's like another soundtrack of dialogue.  You're telling the audience exactly what you want them to feel through something.  So sometimes I'll be writing music on the set while I'm in between shots.  I have a guitar.  I'm not trying to.  I'll just be noodling with a guitar to keep from pacing so I don't want to bump into something.  Someone comes over and says, wow, that's pretty cool. 
[02:33:30]  What are you playing?  I go, I don't know.  It might be the theme for the show.  I don't know.  Then we go write it down.  We use everything.  We eat the head around here.  You know, I like to see it at a dramatic moment.  I like when someone looks and you hear, dun-dun!  You heck!  That's terrible.  I scored Kill Bill 2 for Quentin for a dollar.  I did the score for him because he didn't want to hire a composer.  And I said, I think you'll need a composer on your next Kill Bill because there's a lot of emotional stuff.  He goes, I don't like to use composers. 
[02:34:00]  I go, I need practice.  How about I'll compose it for free?  I'll sell it to you for a dollar.  If you want to use it, it's an experience, practice for me.  And I was listening to the film and there was one part where she had to go up the stairs and it reveals the stairs.  And Quentin, on camera, he went, dun-dun-dun!  Like that.  Like, that's what he wanted.  So I took that and I made the musical equivalent of it.  And he was so happy when he saw it.  He goes, that's exactly what I want.  But musically, you know, with instruments.  Good music does make, like, the best, I think the best movie I've ever seen score was Clockwork Orange. 
[02:34:30]  The fact that they put classical music with the violence.  It was such a weird...  Kind of a point to it.  Yeah.  But I noticed Tarantino's films use a lot of really cool, like, pop culture songs.  It really does make a movie different.  He's like, I don't want to take a chance with a new composer on something.  I'll go to my classic scores that I always love, license those, and put them and have them be the score of my movies.  Right.  So I've got all the best composed music ever in my movies. 
[02:35:00]  Some of the worst movies are old 80s movies because they scored it with that 80s sound and it just dates the shit out of a movie.  And, yeah, you've got to, I guess, be careful of that.  You've got to be careful of the music.  Yeah, yeah.  You could have the coolest movie, but if the music's going, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop.  Yeah, yeah.  It's that subliminal voice telling you, this is the dumbest thing ever watching.  It looks stupid at that point.  And Justice for All is a great film.  The worst fucking music in a movie.  I'm obsessed with how bad the...  Really?  There's one scene where Pacino's running. 
[02:35:30]  Like, I guess he's having, you know, Arthur Kirkland's having this moment.  And it's just terrible music.  You're like, what are they doing?  Oh, yeah.  The Firm had awful music.  Tom Cruise.  I remember movies with really bad music as unwatchable, even if I love the movie.  I think I'm going to have to do some kind of compilation called bad movie scores and just  make it like a mix and put that on the network.  Or watch Injustice for All.  You have to.  It's just so fucking terrible.  One of the great...  We actually played it here on the air.  It was Dusk Till Dawn, the movie, during the dance sequence. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And the band is playing.  And I think we talked about it last time.  All I look at it, I go, oh, it's Hammy from fucking Pee Wee's.  It is.  It's him.  It's Tito la Riva.  It's a little Hammy with the shoe mirrors.  Tito la Riva.  And then I find out he's a very talented musician.  It's an awesome musician.  And that song is fantastic.  It's a great song.  We redid the song.  I have a band, and we redid the song for this show in Spanish.  But it's really cool.  Because it was a really classic song.  The girl wanted to dance to it.  It's just iconic. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, the guitar work in that and the vocals.  It's really an amazing song.  It's a really great song.  Yeah.  Did you cast the entire thing yourself?  Did you just have a bunch of hot chicks coming in trying out for that part?  Or did you actually hire someone to do it?  We saw, well, my casting director, Mary Vernu, who always finds me great people, she brought  in probably about 50 or 60 actresses.  It's really hard to find somebody to take the place, you know, Salma Hayek's role.  But we found her, and she's really awesome.  I cannot wait, because, yeah, that was a good character right there.  We figured, we found it. 
[02:37:00]  You have confidence that you found her.  Oh, yeah.  We're all going to watch just for that scene.  Oh, yeah.  She's an important character.  Yeah.  Well, I get Time Warner in the city.  So I could DVR it.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got to.  About on Long Island, I get...  Slingbox.  A little Slingbox action.  I could Slingbox it back and forth.  You'll do all right.  I had a Slingbox years ago from my manager as a gift, and I just never hooked it up.  And I just sat there, and I finally threw it out, and then he asked me about it recently.  He's like, give me that Slingbox, and I don't know how to say I fucking threw it out. 
[02:37:30]  He has an anchor.  So I'm like, yeah, it's a whole thing.  It's a fucking thing.  It's a whole thing.  You don't want to say, yeah, it's a whole thing.  How do you tell him I took your fucking ribboned gift and dropped it out because I'm too sexually  addicted on the computer to hook anything in my TV up anymore?  Piece of garbage.  You and Quentin seem to get along very well over the years.  Do you have anybody else in the business that you're that close with that you can work  and just say, yeah, for a buck, I'll score your movie?  Yeah.  Who else did I did something for a buck? 
[02:38:00]  We started...  When I told people that story, everybody suddenly wanted to work for a buck.  Yeah.  I did music for Edgar Wright for a dollar.  Oh, really?  Hot Fuzz.  Hot Fuzz.  Oh, you did music for that?  Yeah.  God damn, I was just watching Shaun of the Dead again last night.  That's so great.  Do you know how much money you could charge for that?  Yeah.  Funny movie.  You could have got ten.  A hundred dollars, maybe.  You're right.  It was cool, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  He gave me a British pound and signed it.  Thank you for the score.  It was just a part of the score.  And he framed it, and I framed it. 
[02:38:30]  That's real FU money, by the way.  Yeah.  I'll do it for a dollar.  I'll score a film for a dollar.  Just for some practice and fun.  Just so you have the story.  Blow off the money so you have a good story.  There's another example of some young guys, him, Simon Pegg, having an idea, taking a genre,  and then just completely changing it around.  It was an awesome film.  It was just an amazing job they did on that one.  Yeah, yeah.  Really fun.  Those guys are all great guys.  Yeah.  Yeah, and now fucking Simon Pegg's goddamn Scotty. 
[02:39:00]  Star Trek.  Oh, really?  What the fuck did that happen?  He's just great in everything he does.  Yeah.  What do you think of J.J. doing Star Trek?  Got any opinions on Star Wars?  I'm good friends with J.J.  He's really creative, endlessly.  I think I'm busy.  That guy's busy.  No shit, right?  He's got so much going on all the time, and you never know.  He's the coolest, calmest energy, and writes also, which is really great.  And so, I mean, that is a big set of footprints.  If anybody, I would think he would be the guy to do it. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  That's a big shoes foot top.  I know.  That's crazy.  I can't wait to see him.  But he really knows audience, too, and he really knows how to be faithful to something.  The pressure has got to be crazy, because a lot of people are expecting, like,  all right, finally, you know, we got Lucas out of the loop.  We're going to go in there with Abrams, who's proven with Star Trek that he could kind of relaunch a franchise.  I think it's the right choice.  I think, yeah, they couldn't have picked it up.  I just wish they would have got a terrible director, because I think it would be funny to see it just completely destroyed. 
[02:40:00]  Like, to see a terrible actor playing Luke in a cheesedict storyline in bed, green screening.  Like, oh, nerds.  Really?  Terrible.  Like a sci-fi original movie?  Yeah, but not ironically bad, but just bad.  Like, they mean it to be good.  They're like, oh, I'm fucking proud of it.  We came in under budget, you know, because it was just...  Love disaster, don't you, Jim?  Yeah, I really do.  Travis just yelled, he has to go.  Oh, yeah.  He's a very busy man.  You're a busy man.  Come out, man.  This is fun.  This is Robert Rodriguez.  I know.  Robert, thanks so much, man.  Always a pleasure talking with you. 
[02:40:30]  Well, yeah, let's get the plug in proper here.  It's the El Rey channel, and it's March 11th at 9 o'clock.  And if you want to, I'm sure Robert will be tweeting about it.  It's just Rodriguez on Twitter.  How the fuck did you get Rodriguez on Twitter?  That's a really, really...  Did you have to get that from a fan?  Nobody had it.  Wow.  We're in Mexico, you little piece of shit.  That's a great fucking line.  I would have thought that would have been taken.  So Rodriguez on Twitter, if you want to follow Robert, and you will obviously be able to 
[02:41:00]  find out.  Or go to ElReyNetwork.com.  It's E-L, not just the letter L, E-L-R-E-Y Network.com.  Cool, man.  Thanks so much for coming in, man.  I'm going to see you all again.  Hopi and Anthony are back.  On Sirius XM. 
[02:41:30]  It's no Valkyrie.  Let's just do that for 20 more minutes.  Get over it.  We all have our favorite songs today, don't we?  This is actually a good YouTube song.  I love this fucking song.  I like this one.  The video is pretty cool.  Elevations.  How cool is Robert Rodriguez?  He's great, man.  He's a cool dude in a loose move.  He just showed us pictures of the new Salma Hayek. 
[02:42:00]  The Salma Hayek character from Dusk Till Dawn.  The TV series.  The TV series that he's doing.  It has the same character.  They figured it out.  Oh, my God.  Is she fucking stunning?  Yeah, they figured it out.  It's going to do very well.  And the look of it.  Because there were some stills of him filming the TV series.  Holy shit.  Yeah, yeah.  He's a talented motherfucker, man.  He's great, man.  He really is.  Not a worry in the world.  No.  And he takes those chances.  He takes the risks.  Puts them on himself. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, but you made a good point.  He starts to make a movie.  When you live in a mansion and probably have a yacht, you could take some chances.  Some people don't want to take chances.  They get to that point and get scared.  Right.  You know?  It's weird.  People are more willing to take a chance when you have nothing to lose, you know?  True.  But he, when he had nothing to lose, was willing to take a shot at it.  And, you know, when he's got some cake.  I like his movies, though.  He's fucking talented.  And they have that unique look, obviously, too.  Yeah, yeah.  We didn't even talk about Harold Ramis today. 
[02:43:00]  I don't know what there is to say.  Oh, man.  I know.  That's pretty bad.  This one was a bummer because so many of the movies that we grew up loving, the list  is just unbelievable.  Caddyshack, Stripes, Animal House, Ghostbusters, Groundhog Day.  And him being in Stripes was really, like, he was funny in that.  And he was the complete dry, straight, play it straight guy to Bill Murray's, like, goofy  guy.  I hated the second half of that movie, though. 
[02:43:30]  Stripes.  Well, yeah.  That first half was pretty strong, right?  Yeah.  John Candy was funny in the second half.  All right, boys.  Let's bring him up.  All right, boys.  Bring him up.  Bring him up.  Come on, boys.  Come on.  What did he have?  His arteries were just choking themselves or something?  Weird thing.  He had got an infection or something.  And there was something that happened, I think, in surgery.  It got fucked up, and it shouldn't have.  Basically, I have no idea what I'm talking about.  But I know it wasn't like a disease that he would have been caught.  And they said he had a long illness, so he was really fucking dealing and suffering 
[02:44:00]  with this for a while.  His health woes began in mid-2010 after complications from surgery for diverticulitis.  Ah, diverticulitis.  Yeah, he probably had the lower colon of the intestines when you get, like, seeds and things  of that nature.  My wine has a lot of seeds in it, and it will upset your diverticulitis.  Like, I have ass hairs under my nose.  They look like mustache hairs.  Why did that lead to the other thing?  Yeah, what did he have? 
[02:44:30]  I don't understand.  It's an autoimmune disease.  Oh, did it?  And then it fucked up his walking, so he had to learn how to walk again.  Wow.  It took four months of therapy for him to learn how to walk again after all this.  And that back is one of his lines in Streis was, hey, look, we're walking.  Right.  Oh, that's terrible.  You think he thought about that as he's trying to walk again?  Maybe.  He regained his strength at a rehab clinic in Chicago, but then suffered a relapse  and never fully recovered, the paper reported.  Hmm. 
[02:45:00]  That blows.  Sam.  Yeah.  He was fucking funny.  There's, when he bets Bill Murray that Bill Murray can't do five push-ups or whatever  it was, and Bill Murray lays on the floor and he goes, that's none.  Just delivered perfectly.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's dry.  Yeah.  He was very dry.  Great director.  It was weird, because after Stripes, I kind of thought he would be in a bunch of movies. 
[02:45:30]  He had, obviously, Ghostbusters, but then he went into directing.  He kind of, you know.  He went behind the camera.  You don't see him on screen anymore.  No.  And then you saw him after that and he got, like, old and fat.  Right.  Like, what happened to the guy?  He didn't have to keep himself in shape.  No, no.  Because he was behind the camera.  It was nice and easy.  You could eat.  Right.  Yeah.  But that was a bummer.  Yeah, that was kind of soft.  69, 68, 69 years old.  Yeah.  Funny man. 
[02:46:00]  Hey, funny man.  I don't know what else to say about it.  Yeah.  They'll carry out a quick little quote, or not quote, statement about him.  So they worked together on a lot of movies and he was just a nice guy.  Yeah.  All you hear about him is, like, nice things.  There was never any scandal with this guy, right?  No.  Nothing like that.  He seemed pretty regular.  Pretty good.  Yeah.  Hey, Godspeed there.  Godspeed, Harold.  Jimmy.  The Todd Show hashtag?  More Todd Show hashtag.  I just read the tweets of a man named Jacques Tober. 
[02:46:30]  Jacques Tober.  It's probably Jacques Tober.  Oh, you're probably right.  I'm sorry.  I'm not as worldly.  Jacques Tober.  It's supposed to be like Jacques Tober.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Uh-oh.  Wiki's out there.  There's no meeting, is there?  Wiki, wiki, wiki, wiki.  Hey, what are you drinking?  Army socks?  Stop bringing it up.  I chose not to do the NutriBullet today.  Why is that?  Because other people need to know.  Opie dissed my NutriBullet.  Why, your old school NutriBullet?  That fucking outdated model? 
[02:47:00]  If they sent me that, I'm fucking throwing it at Roland's taint.  How did we get NutriBullets today?  I don't know.  Roland yesterday sent me a text, all excited, saying, hey, your NutriBullet came in.  I'm like, ooh.  And then I get it.  I'm all excited to take it home.  And then who has the big pin to pop my fucking balloon of joy?  I do.  Greg Opie-Hughes.  But I got the 600 watt, and it's nice.  But they were bragging to me, because I'm getting some envelopes from these guys these days. 
[02:47:30]  Jesus Christ.  Come on.  I hope not.  Getting a few envelopes, and they promised me the 900.  Oh.  Supposedly they got a 900 W out there.  But which one do you have?  I got that one.  It works fine.  Okay.  No, that one works great.  Oh, but you're getting the better one.  But they already told me, we're on to the 900, and we'll send you one.  Maybe it's not built yet, like Dr. Ian Smith's.  Did he really go old school with his blender?  They're putting it together with fucking nuts and bolts.  Remember how excited he was that he showed us on the website what his blender was going 
[02:48:00]  Oh, I'm like, oh.  Don't you know that the trend is to have those blades, you know, not at the bottom like that  when you're cleaning, where you can just screw off the blades and clean it fast?  Oh, it's terrible.  Look how fucking big it is.  It's like, oh, it's like what mom used to make, like, fucking milkshakes in.  It looks like there's a lot of fake buttons on it.  Like, those buttons are there for show.  Right, they don't do anything.  You know how many buttons are on the Nutribullet?  Zero.  Wow.  Exactly zero.  That twist, and it turns on the Nutribullet is the coolest. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, it's the best.  Nah, we don't know for sure.  This might be the new thing.  You never know, right?  Oh, no.  I don't think so.  You can't say that.  No, I don't think it's going to do well.  The bad thing is it looks old.  It just looks old.  It looks like it's broken.  Oh, it looks like it should just be on the shelf and not work.  You don't even plug it in.  There's other things plugged in behind it.  It looks like it's on a wedding registry from 1992.  Oh, no.  We want this blender. 
[02:49:00]  We need this blender.  Maybe it screws off, though.  Maybe the blade screws off.  Well, if you'd yell, tell it to.  Let's screw off.  That's pretty funny.  I'm tired of all this talk about blenders, Gregory.  Oh, no.  Ted, you're in the blender business?  I certainly am.  Yeah.  Ted's Blender Emporium.  Wow.  Well, what makes your blender so special?  The Nutribullet has taken over the world.  We don't leave any of those stupid tops on.  Ted, you just put all the stuff in and allow it to swirl around in goodness.  But the top keeps it from going all over the place. 
[02:49:30]  Yes, that's true.  I've noticed that.  People are complaining.  They have to spatula stuff off the ceiling.  Well, why don't you fix that, Ted?  Because I'm out of funds.  How many of these blenders have you sold?  I've sold two, and I've purchased both of them.  It's got 45 axe blades in it.  40 axe blades.  What are you making with this?  Whatever you want.  So usually lettuce jubilees.  That sounds horrendous. 
[02:50:00]  What's in a lettuce jubilee besides the lettuce?  Ice.  Ice and lettuce.  Ice and lettuce.  Oh, my God.  That sounds terrible.  Yes, and there's no top, and the axe blades just swirl it up, violently spinning around.  An hour and 20 minutes later, you're ready for a delicious beverage.  An hour and 20 minutes.  That's a long time, Ted.  Now, the Nutribullet, they brag that you should be using fruits and vegetables.  Exactly.  I don't believe in that type of...  Then you're going to get a mongrel beverage. 
[02:50:30]  So just lettuce.  Absolutely.  It's all about lettuce.  It will be destroyed.  Yes, both beverages will be destroyed.  I believe that lettuce should be with lettuce and tomatoes with tomatoes.  You don't like mixing of the vegetables?  I certainly don't, especially a big, dark cucumber with a very small, light-colored fruit.  The Nutribullet gives you, like, a recipe book.  Are you going to have a recipe book?  Yes, I am. 
[02:51:00]  How to make lettuce jubilee!  Page after page of lettuce jubilee!  But it just sounds terrible.  Lettuce jubilee.  Oh, wait.  The Shred Emulsifier has its own YouTube video.  Yeah, I just saw it.  Throw the avocado in there with the cucumbers.  Push one of the fake buttons.  How easy is that to clean?  That's all I want to know.  Looks difficult.  Because I stopped blending shit because I couldn't fucking put my arm all the way in there to try to clean the blade. 
[02:51:30]  And then clean under the blade.  How do you do that?  And then Nutribullet, they come up with this, well, you just screw it off and run it under the faucet.  You're done in 10 seconds.  Cleanup is 10 seconds.  And there's not one mention of a boost on this whole thing.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Well, maybe Nutribullet owns the word boost.  Oh, maybe.  Because you need it.  Yeah, you do need the boost.  I'm sure he's got another word for boost.  Yeah.  Well, the Shred Emulsifier looks pretty impressive.  Jumpstart.  Boobies. 
[02:52:00]  Suits.  Wow.  It's steaming.  It is piping hot.  Wow.  Piping hot.  Why are they saying, why is she amazed it's piping hot?  Didn't it go in there piping hot?  It's not heating it.  It's not heating it, you dummy.  Or is it?  Frozen drinks.  He's saying you can make peanut butter with this thing.  Look at that.  Frozen treats.  It's all about desserts.  It's about being realistic.  Ian!  Love your best shot.  He can hear me, right? 
[02:52:30]  I think so.  Now he's there.  One simple button.  I'm worried about these fake-looking buttons.  The power to lose weight.  The power to feel more energized.  And the power to live a healthier life.  Where'd they get these fucking people for this?  Talking about making ice cream in a blender.  Yeah, first of all, none of them got to use the blender because we found out the hard way there aren't any of them.  Yeah, that's true.  Well, that was the prototype.  We're still making them.  He's still making them.  There's fucking tubes and fucking generators underneath.  Second of all, this weight loss blender, he's just using it to make soup and ice cream so far. 
[02:53:00]  Sounds good to me.  I love soup.  I love ice cream.  Larry King says he's open to coming back to replace Pierce.  That is not happening, Larry.  I'm sorry.  Larry, they're going to go young.  They have moved on from you.  They're going young.  Although we love you here on the radio show.  You think he stepped down voluntarily?  No.  And everyone's making fun of him.  Of course they are.  Everyone's making fun of him that he decided to step down.  Except Dick Van Dyke.  Dick Van Dyke said it was his dumb move and that he'll be back with bells on. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, why doesn't Dick Van Dyke shut up?  I told him he fell over that ottoman one too many times.  Oh, nice.  He didn't respond.  How is it a dumb move if the guy's not getting ratings?  I know.  It's all about ratings.  They gave him enough.  They gave him three years, I believe.  Dick Van Dyke knows that.  Yeah.  I just saw Ron Ben...  Wait, he was always talking about Piers Morgan?  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't mean he was talking about Larry King.  No, no.  Piers.  It's not a dumb move.  They gave him three years.  They gave him a very good chance to try to get it together and it just didn't happen. 
[02:54:00]  There's rumors they might go with Anderson Cooper and Kathy Griffin.  That's not going to happen, right?  How early does Ron Bennington get here?  He must have something else going on.  Look at him.  He's a creepy outfit.  He's walking around like a chick.  Long jacket.  Fucking jacket with a whole cut in the front.  Yeah.  Oh, hi, Blondie.  Ronnie.  Ronnie.  Ronnie.  Getting your Harold Ramis info together?  That's a shame, right? 
[02:54:30]  You know what happened?  He probably didn't hear you.  We don't have much to say.  He just made all those films that we loved.  Oh, jeez, huh?  Nah, that's pretty terrible.  That's a tough one.  We grew up on his movies.  Pretty goddamn terrible.  You know, that's the weird thing, too, about death.  You really don't realize how much you like someone until they die.  You know, that's why we need more of our friends to die.  You know what I mean?  Because that would show us.  At a certain point, we're going to be like, hey, Sam was great.  I mean, we didn't really notice, but he's always around starting shit. 
[02:55:00]  Even Fez would be upset.  Well, Fez did a beautiful eulogy for me yesterday.  See, here's the Fez thing.  He's crying during the show, and I'm like, finally, what the fuck is wrong?  And I didn't remember his dad's death anniversary.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  How many years?  How many years?  Three years.  Three years.  That's counting.  Three years.  Plenty of time to kind of push that shit down.  You think you should be over it by now?  I was good after three. 
[02:55:30]  Okay.  Damn.  I'm moving on ten this year.  That's a quick ten.  Ten years, huh?  For my pops.  Wow.  Damn.  I was good after the first year cycle.  Got to go through all the fucking holidays and stuff for the first time without pops.  And then after that, it starts getting okay.  Go through those?  Yeah.  It still sucks, but I ain't going to fucking cry about it.  Well, you know what?  You really should have died.  I was like, but I did take care of your dad.  And that was the last time.  You know what I mean?  You really take care of your parents good. 
[02:56:00]  Right, right.  I was going to keep them for a long time.  They'll be around for a while.  You know, I didn't leave them out in the yard like some of you guys, letting them rust.  Yeah, like an old snow shovel just laying against the shed.  Got a lot of reports on you yesterday.  So you had Fez do his own eulogy on the show?  No, I had him do my eulogy.  Your eulogy?  Yeah, I heard you made him do his own.  No, I made him sit and say, you know, like he was doing for me, and I kept interrupting him.  And then finally Michelle ran down the hall and made me stop.  But it wasn't an official Tim thing, I don't believe. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, wow.  But it was pushing it too far.  It was going too far?  Yeah.  She ran down the hall to tell you to stop?  Who's Michelle?  Tim's assistant.  Tim's assistant.  No, she's management.  What?  Yeah.  Oh.  Wait, wait.  Assistant manager?  Assistant to the assistant manager of the movie theater.  How do you not know how this place runs, Sam?  Yeah, Sam.  I thought you were executive producer now.  I thought she assists.  Wait, Tim.  What was the reasoning?  I had Fez really upset.  That's great radio. 
[02:57:00]  Well, you know.  You put it all back together after it's over.  Who cares?  Get the glue out and the duct tape and pull it back together.  Stop the bit.  No, but in a fun way.  Oh, okay.  In a fun way.  Just like, please don't be mean to Fez anymore.  Yes, yes, but gee, you don't realize when we have a male-dominated audience, they're fine with it.  I didn't tell you this, too.  I've been asked to save a marriage. 
[02:57:30]  I am going to save Voss and Bonnie's marriage at a gig on March 11th.  They've asked me to come in.  How are you shooting Voss?  At the village?  Yeah, the village underground.  Underground, right?  I'm going to go there and save their relationship.  How are you going to do that?  I think I'm going to talk him through it.  You're going to talk him through it?  Yeah, I'm going to talk him through it.  I love it if you got...  This could be like an intervention.  Oh, man.  I think I'm going to save the marriage and destroy the podcast.  Right.  He's hosting the Richard Bonnie podcast.  Oh, that's great. 
[02:58:00]  At the village underground.  When is it again?  That's great.  March 11th.  I might...  I got to go to that.  You got to go to it.  What day is it?  I don't know what they fall into.  The Vosses, though, they like doing things late.  They're weird.  They're always inviting us out to dinner.  They're like, so I got a reservation for 10 o'clock.  10 o'clock for dinner?  I get up at 4.30.  What are you doing?  I never get a call from Voss to go out to dinner.  What a worm.  Oh.  Well, the ladies are very close.  So we, you know, it's more the ladies.  Is that what it is?  The gals like to get together?  The gals like each other.  So they're bringing us all together.  But they're always like, yeah, 10. 
[02:58:30]  Is 10 cool?  No, 10's not cool.  Why don't you go out for 10 o'clock salads?  That'd be nice.  I got to fucking sleep.  It's fun when we get everyone together.  Exactly.  I like it.  What are you doing here so early?  I came in to meet Robert Rodriguez.  Oh.  Looks like I might be doing a Spanish show with him.  Ah, see.  See.  How's your Spanish?  It's pretty good.  You got to just brush up on it a little bit.  I don't really know a lot of Spanish, so I do hand signals. 
[02:59:00]  Okay.  You'll get by with that.  You'll be all right.  Yeah.  You got good facial expressions.  Thank you very much.  You'll be able to sell it.  I like to think of myself as radio pantomime.  Okay.  And I'm not used to seeing you with a big laptop like that.  You've went back to big, huh?  I kind of like this size for my purposes.  A lot of people go smaller and smaller and smaller.  Can't do that anymore.  You're going back.  You can't.  You go small, then you go back.  And also, we've relegated ourselves to watching very small porn these days. 
[02:59:30]  It really is like we're punishing ourselves.  Not in the way you're saying.  We're punishing ourselves.  Everybody decided they could blow off the laptops these days for an iPad or an iPhone or something.  And then your pornography is tiny.  You don't want to do telephone porn.  No.  I like your full-size laptop, full-size porn.  And it looks so much better that way. 
[03:00:00]  Do you also throw it up on your 75-inch screen at your house?  It's a 90.  It's a 90-inch.  Oh, it's a 90.  Yeah, yeah.  Excuse me.  I'm a little behind, Ron.  And through Apple TV, I've thrown giant, hardcore pornography up on that screen.  And it's fabulous, I must say.  That, my video games, all the fun things.  Skyscraper porn could be the new thing.  Skyscraper porn.  But it is bad, because my house, I don't really have curtains on the lower floor like 
[03:00:30]  that.  And I don't know if somebody's going to be coming to the door.  You can't just hang out on the couch anymore.  Like you care.  Fuck you.  Skanking.  Who cares?  I just see you just end up beating him to death with a bowling pin.  Run, you stoop.  Yeah, it is.  It's not like the old days.  You have a small apartment.  You close the windows.  You're all alone.  This, you know, people come to the door.  You're wide out there. 
[03:01:00]  It's like...  I am.  I'm out there.  Watching porn in a mall.  Yeah, yeah.  It's one of the...  It is.  It's like I'm in the fucking...  The piano store with all the windows.  And you really can't say to someone, I'll be right with you, I'm jerking off right now.  No, no, no.  Exactly.  Mm-mm.  Exactly.  You can hint it.  By saying I'll be there in a second.  Yeah.  I have to assume.  I don't watch on TV porn.  Only on my computer.  Just computer porn.  Only computer porn.  Yeah, and it's always...  The laptop's very easy to hide.  Never on TV.  Not in years.  Where do you go for your porn? 
[03:01:30]  Some scary Mexican website that none of us have heard?  Yes.  Ronnie's keeping tabs on the show.  El Narco Blago.  Whatever it's called.  No, I just go to fucking Clitty or...  Clitty?  Clitty.com is a massive mega site.  Clitty.  I never even knew there was a Clitty.  No, you know, it's your one-stop shopping.  Yeah, what else could it be, right?  It's your Home Depot.  Yeah, there's no confusion when you click on Clitty.  No, not at all.  Wow, that's pretty cool.  Yeah, or Xtube or Xhammer.  Yeah, there's plenty.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:02:00]  Just put a cuck in the search engine and fucking knock yourself out.  I do like that you can just put whatever you damn well please, even in Google, and, you  know, videos will come up.  Sure.  Whatever you need.  Oh, no new cucks.  Damn it.  Refresh, refresh.  I don't know how the adult film industry is even doing anything.  I don't know how they do anything.  They're in trouble.  They make money by going to these mega sites.  They sell advertising.  That's why whenever you open a fucking porn, and that little ad pops up behind it, and  you're watching one thing, and then you hear, yeah, I'm right here on the phone. 
[03:02:30]  Boop, boop, behind it.  That's how they make their money.  Yeah, I don't like it either.  It scares me.  Yeah, me too.  It's jerking off.  I think someone walked in the room.  Exactly.  And you're like, why is someone 20 years older than her talking?  Now, here's the thing, though.  How many women do you think you've seen doing porn now in the internet age?  Isn't it amazing?  It's got to be thousands upon thousands.  30.  Thousands.  Yeah, him.  I mean, don't you think that you would bump into quite a few people like you would recognize? 
[03:03:00]  I mean, I'm sure we have been in the mall with someone who's uploaded their porn before.  You're right, but who's looking at their faces.  Some amateur stuff you look at and go, she looks familiar.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I've been through a few sites, picture sites, where I've seen pictures that were taken  in our very studio.  Oh, wow.  It's a proud moment.  Someone's actually finding the Patty stuff?  Yeah.  Is that a Simpsons mask she has on?  What category is that under? 
[03:03:30]  Why is...  Decrepid.  What the fuck is Wiki doing?  He's pointing at the clock.  Is he waiting for us?  He's happy that we're doing overtime.  I don't have time.  Oh, yeah.  I don't have time for Don Wiki Wickland.  You ruined it now.  You ruined it.  You ruined it.  Why would he say that?  That's it.  I'm folding up.  You just ruined it.  I'm folding up.  Oh, Jesus.  What the fuck?  Pittsburgh this Friday.  Pittsburgh.  That's how you plug.  Just keep the fucking tone of the same.  People listen.  I hear you.  That's going to be a big one, too, right? 
[03:04:00]  Oh, sure.  Seats available.  Oh, boy.  It's going to be great.  Know what I say?  Oh, excuse me.  Know what I say?  What's that?  Get over it.  Yeah, you're right.  Get over it.  Get over it.  If you've got the back couple rows open, get over it.  Get over it.  Thank you, Ron.  I gave you credit on Twitter, I think.  Turning me on to that Eagles documentary when you came in here.  It's a good one, isn't it?  I watched the whole fucking thing.  Five Guys Who Hate Each Other.  It's a great rock and roll story.  Glenn Frey seems to be a dick. 
[03:04:30]  None of them, I don't believe.  I don't think I've...  I met Don Henley.  Not even Joe Walsh?  Uh...  I don't think over the years.  I hope you stood up.  He's actually taking my Nutribullet.  Yes.  I got my showdown.  Oh, you're into the Nutribullet thing, too, huh?  They sent me one.  That's great.  I've never Nutribulleted before.  And you love it, oh, no.  Love it.  I'd ask you about it, but Wiki's sitting there.  Oh, Wiki.  Driving the show down.  Ron Bennington on Raw Dog at noon today.  Yes.  We should go check that shit out. 
[03:05:00]  And come see me with Voss and Bonnie as I hopefully fix it.  This marriage.  It's a lot of work you got cut out for me.  Well, you know, Jimmy gave me a great idea of shooting Voss on stage.  Just shooting Voss.  I actually do have to go.  How long before Bonnie would start dating?  Hang out.  What?  How long before Bonnie would start dating?  I think she has already.  Oh, wait, tops.  I...  The Opie and Anthony show has drawn to a close.  Stay tuned to reflect, relive, and get the story behind the story of the finest moments 
[03:05:30]  of today's show.  Sam Roberts' Opie and Anthony post show begins in moments. </pre>
