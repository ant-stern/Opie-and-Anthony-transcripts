<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of the World Cup, marked by the hosts' blatant disdain for soccer and its fans, punctuated with profanity.  They struggled to comprehend the rules, particularly the complexities of the group stage and tiebreakers.  The growing popularity of the World Cup in the US, fueled by ESPN's marketing, was discussed, alongside the incessant and irritating sound of vuvuzelas, exemplified by played audio clips.  The conversation veered into comparisons of various sports playoffs, with Opie expressing his frustration with the NBA Finals' length.  Chuck Liddell's UFC loss to Rich Franklin was dissected, including Dana White's comments on Liddell's future, along with a story about the hosts' reaction to the knockout in a theater.  Other tangents included the Puerto Rican Day Parade, chaotic World Cup match scenes, and a hilarious extended audio clip of Wally Backman's expletive-filled baseball meltdown.  Callers contributed to the chaotic energy, and the show concluded with further World Cup talk, podcasting discussions, and an anecdote about Adam Carolla.

The show then shifted to a detailed discussion about Adam Carolla's podcast and the financial challenges of podcasting, specifically his $10,000 monthly bandwidth costs despite a large audience.  The hosts and callers debated podcast profitability and the difficulties of integrating advertising into live streams, with a caller detailing intrusive advertising experiences.  Their past interactions with Carolla, described as having a "weird vibe," were recounted, with a listener explaining Corolla's own admission of difficulty connecting with people initially.  Phil Hendry ("fucking lunatic," but a good broadcaster) and Dr. Drew (surprisingly nice, despite past on-air criticism) were mentioned. The Gulf oil spill, the Obama administration's response, and the broader political implications were touched upon.  A lengthy review of the movie *Grown Ups*, including Adam Sandler and Kevin James' appearances and comparisons to other films like *Paul Blart: Mall Cop* and *Observe and Report*, followed, along with reflections on the relationship between poor reviews and box office success for certain comedies.  The discussion included favorite story songs (a caller corrected them on the term "ballads"),  Frank Sinatra (including graphic and sexually explicit claims), Joran van der Sloot's imprisonment, and conditions in Peruvian prisons.  The entire segment utilized frequent crude and offensive language.

The next segment began with Father’s Day reminiscences, seguing into a crude anecdote about one host's brother-in-law and drug use.  A caller, Becky, challenged the hosts' use of "story songs," leading to more Frank Sinatra discussion, including graphic and sexually explicit anecdotes. A listener criticized Don McLean's "American Pie," prompting a discussion of the song's meaning and a vulgar critique of a Big Bopper video.  A significant portion was dedicated to a furious caller, "Randy Taylor," complaining about smaller Jimmy Dean sausage packages, which led to extended humorous commentary on his family's sausage consumption and perceived obesity.  The hosts repeatedly played portions of this call.  The segment ended with a discussion of East Side Dave's employment situation, his lack of health insurance, and potential Costco employment.  Finally, the hosts interviewed intern Derek, whose racist tweets were read and discussed, with Derek blaming some tweets on things he’d heard from others, including a homeless person.

The final segment heavily featured intern Derek, who claimed to have been robbed violently over 40 times since age 13, primarily by Black men, providing details of several incidents.  The hosts, a former law enforcement caller (Kenny), and another caller (Striker, a former pizza delivery driver) expressed skepticism, pointing out inconsistencies in his story, lack of visible scars, and questionable employment history.  The discussion devolved into racially charged comments and generalizations from Derek.  A caller, Coop, had significant connection issues.  Stanley T, a Black radio host from Philadelphia, joined the discussion and challenged Derek's narrative.  The segment concluded with further questioning of Derek's credibility, interspersed with tangents on music preferences, celebrity body parts, and the Natalie Holloway case.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  our show is stupid this is so irresponsible this should be illegal it really should be it's like  it's so unethical god i hate fucking radio this could be the worst audio ever  shut up shut your fucking mouth this is terrible we just suck all around i hope you show restraint 
[00:00:30]  in fucking my girlfriend this stinks fucking shut the fuck up we get it get it but enough of this  palaver let's get the show on the road  i know holy shit it's way too early for this eddie in uh saint louis good morning by the way it's 
[00:01:00]  monday he can't wait to talk sports anthony what yeah i think he i think he thinks we do a sports  uh show yeah why would anyone think that well we like to take a little peek here and there yeah  on the screen urinal too but that's that's on our show the urinal show usually but on the phones  right off the bat wants to talk about the world cup oh i know a lot of people are watching this 
[00:01:30]  world cup more than usual they really are they really are you know why because the um minority  population is up ah well i'm sure that's a factor but a lot of whiteys are watching and trying to  figure this out i'm telling you whiteys watching this a lot more whiteys i'm not saying it's as  popular as baseball or any of these other sports in the white community but uh irak was telling me  he was at some dumb beer garden watching world cup yesterday when germany was playing 
[00:02:00]  ah well that's okay you got to be rooting for germany it's a beer garden watching germany play  i asked you if you watched uh usa versus england or england versus usa they were playing they were  playing on um saturday i watched the entire game i i said to myself all right i want to know what  this whole thing is about this world cup uh i hear the american team is okay uh i hear they don't have  a chance against england i'm gonna watch yeah i watched the entire thing it ends in a one-one tie 
[00:02:30]  and uh we're in the same boat ant i don't know what i watched i don't know what i watched or why you  watched and then i tweeted did i watch a good game because i have no fucking idea and i wasn't  even trying to make a joke or anything i don't know if it was a good game if a game ends in a  one-one tie after i don't know two hours of straight play without without a timeout is that  a good game i have no idea that's that's why i i just can't have to can't half the time is trying to 
[00:03:00]  get the soccer ball forward about a quarter mile to hope for a shot at the goal and that's just  exhausting to watch because every time they almost get kind of close and someone kicks in the attack  area then all of a sudden they kick it the other way it's like oh my god i really did try i i i i will  not be a soccer fan no so what does that mean one one tie i don't know like what what happens is  another game to play or is that it no no it's a it's a bracket thing they play more games the 
[00:03:30]  newspapers in new york were saying usa wins and then showed you know uh one one tie with england  so everyone is considering this is a a win for the united states because they weren't supposed to  beat england oh really high england is like a win i guess exactly i i'm i'm i don't exactly how it  works exactly you can't play a game in a like a bracketed sport how could you play a game and have 
[00:04:00]  a tie like what happens they move on to who and why i think it's a big letdown a tie in soccer just  keep playing until sudden death i don't care if it takes all night just do something probably would  a one-on-one tie everyone walks away with just a bad feeling in their mouths  no i don't know i hold well we won't spend too much is it a points thing eddie thanks for taking  my call guys i want to say in my own defense i called probably 60 70 times and it's not always 
[00:04:30]  been about sports but to answer your question uh if we wind up tying the bracket they use gold  differential to decide who moves on what all right whatever i don't even care what the fuck is goal  differential that's basically like uh say that we uh tie england uh decide who moves on whoever has  more goals goals yeah i get it all right whoever has more goals in what game so well no it's it's a  it's a tournament together it's a tournament basically so let's say uh the u.s wins three 
[00:05:00]  loses two germany wins three loses two i know this is probably a joke to just even say that to the  hardcore soccer fans so then what they do is them they see which team scored more goals to move on  so where's the u.s the tiebreaker compared to england i don't know eddie how many the first game so  we both basically have one goal so always oh in the tournament not the entire season right when  does when does the united states play again uh five days i think in five days how long is this world  cup uh how long does this take longer than the nba fucking finals it goes from june 11th july 11th 
[00:05:30]  it's a whole month of soccer anthony we've just begun this world cup excitement thing we're quick fix  people here we're never gonna love soccer no the u.s will never embrace soccer it's crazy uh yes iraq  or metrics if i'm reading this right they play on the 23rd against algeria okay oh that's the game  i wanted to see actually oh yeah what do you got in that game algeria well i understand sonny 
[00:06:00]  warczuk is playing for them that's where they went after they wanted to go there after dog day  afternoon you want a plane to fly you to algeria you like a bunch of crazy people with things on their  heads with things on their heads no mike in new york very upset with us mike good morning boys  right the tournament the tournament has a group stage that's where you see them playing all these  bizarre nations so united states plays england it's a great game no one in the world wants to watch  algeria play anybody don't don't delude yourself but whoever has the most points at the end of the 
[00:06:30]  group goes on and then it's one off you play head to head you win you go on gotcha so initially  it's a goal thing right with the groups right and then what happens is believe it or not ties are  critical because there's only three games the first game or a win is three points a tie is one point  so if the winner comes out of the group with only four points a tie is critical exactly okay 
[00:07:00]  are a lot of americans watching the world cup i guess that's what i'm asking this morning yeah you  know you know what the issue is step back and look at it espn spent so much money marketing this  stuff and espn is basically saying that all their advertising is sold out you know it's it's yeah i  believe for some we are a country that is uh has a lot more minorities in it but for some reason this  world cup is is a bit more exciting this time around than last time anthony i don't know why 
[00:07:30]  and i'm not just saying minorities do you hear westchester is now um because of the census  they just uh found this out that children uh are are there's more minority children now hispanic  children uh in westchester than any other group so uh whitey is now the minority in westchester uh  according to what's going to happen it's the first new york suburb that has uh turned completely like um 
[00:08:00]  uh where whitey is the minority is that hispanic well it's just hispanics are really like wow can  they fucking breed it's amazing it's amazing yeah great soccer teams up in westchester fellas the what  great soccer teams up in westchester oh well now it makes sense i'm trying to understand this world  cup thing because i know a lot of people are definitely watching and espn is uh really all in  with the coverage uh i don't know and and and they're selling horns or something i'm i'm bummed 
[00:08:30]  you didn't take a peek very angry about the horns i've seen this on the news but you gotta just you  gotta just tune in a game just for five minutes to to see how annoying this horn sound is yeah i don't  know what it is i guess they're selling horns at the concession stands and people just blow them the  entire game and it sounds like it sounds like just uh bumblebees in the stadium they want to  ban them well they should because it's really really obnoxious do we have an audio of one i'm sure we 
[00:09:00]  have audio of that one of a brief for all right thank you mike i'm going back to eddie hey what's  the horn thing all about eddie you know that's very fucking annoying it's like when i go to a  playoff game in baseball and they have those thunder sticks i mean you just got some douchebag  banging it through the whole fucking game and it just really ruins the experience anthony's not a fan of  the thunder sticks hate the thunder stick hate the thunder stick i think anthony was absolutely  correct when he was talking about the demographic shift in the u.s i mean now that basically the  united states and mexico are one country that explains why the the ratings are going through  the roof but i mean you know if you look at how much money they they sold you know sell the 
[00:09:30]  advertising for in the united states versus say like you know latin america i mean it's four or five  times more money exactly and you know you know what else uh i don't see many cars driving around  with american flags uh on their hood on the roof of their car in the back window celebrating their  country and their team for the world cup i see a lot of flags that i recognize as flags from other  countries and other lands yeah but we never did that as americans yeah well we never like put an 
[00:10:00]  american flag in our car and drove around but we're not into that whole thing like you'll see brazil  brazilian flags everywhere puerto rican flags are everywhere because it was the puerto rican uh  parade right over uh the weekend and uh yeah we just i mean to get that into soccer where you're  taking your country's flag and putting it on your car i mean we wouldn't do that national pride for a  lot of people well because that's all they got as far as the national pride goes soccer we have tanks 
[00:10:30]  and we blow things up but but the one thing about the world cup it's the one sport where you're  truly playing the world like we call the war is too and we're good at that we call it the world  series but we don't really play any baseball teams from anywhere else in the world canada  well i guess uh canada you're right about that but besides canada yeah that's it but with the world  cup it's truly your country against other countries so that's what makes it pretty exciting for a lot of 
[00:11:00]  people out there exactly unfortunately the usa has never had a really good team yeah well what was the  best uh world cup for the united states eddie uh that was probably way back and i believe it was  the 60s when we beat england one to nothing the guy who scored the goal was from haiti and he wound  up going back there and they murdered him hey see it's just why did they murder this savagery going  on i don't get it how great is that though can you imagine this happening in major league baseball  where they actually murder the players because they're that pissed off yeah right you might want to 
[00:11:30]  take a look at this and i i don't remember i think it's true but uh back one time columbia was playing  in the world cup and their goalie wound up having an own goal and then yeah that body in a dumpster i  think a few weeks after he went back oh jimmy was talking about this the last week yeah and the  murderer what uh yelled out own goal own goal just before he killed him they uh yeah they take it a  little too seriously i mean it's like the people that wanted to kill don denkinger when he fucked up the  85 world series you're gonna have crazy people all over the world but honestly i think do you really need a 
[00:12:00]  flag to to love your country i mean it seems like it's a you know well that's just a symbol of it  but you know you see it all over the place in new york well that confuses me we have a very diverse  city here a lot of people proud of where they come from but they're living here i don't know i've  always been confused by that well i mean if you go to canada are you going to be rocking an american  flag or a canadian flag i'm telling you americans that have never really done that the only time was  right after 9 11 we all saw that right after 9 11 we certainly were riding around with uh 
[00:12:30]  the american flag on our cars in one way or another little flags going out the window and then we  didn't even care enough because like we've brought up many times in the show within what a week  those little flags were in the gutters and on the side of the highway because they flew off the  car no one cared kind of weird and then we you know completely forgot about it uh let's go to  walt to jersey who's on with eddie in st louis walt walt walt walt listen eddie uh you have no idea 
[00:13:00]  what you're talking about regarding the best u.s world cup they beat england not in the 60s it was  1950 world cup won nothing okay and the reason why there's no american pride for the world cup is  because they never made the world cup from 1950 to 1990 so that's 40 years of no u.s in the world  cup wait wait you have to qualify hold on hold on hold on you have to qualify just to get in the world 
[00:13:30]  cup yeah you have to qualify you don't you don't have a thousand countries in it i didn't know that i  thought everybody was in i thought everybody was in too the only team i guess automatically is a team  that is the country that hosts the world cup wow i hope we never host out oh god what a pain in the  ass probably throw it here in new york or something there's one country host the world cup or a bunch  of it goes a bunch of one country it's uh it's south africa right now yeah it's usually one country  but uh eight years ago uh two countries hosted it all right thank you sir and the world cup was in 
[00:14:00]  2002 when they made it to the quarterfinals hey that's something eddie you douche all right uh  eddie the douche anthony here's the horns that they've been oh okay but i don't know what the  deal is with the horns i guess they sell them people aren't coming to the stadium with these  horns so i guess they sell them they're kind of like the thunder sticks the entire game is what you  hear anthony it's and you got the announcers trying to talk over this it's the only time they stop 
[00:14:30]  blowing the horns is if you know someone scores  the entire game three hours of this  every shitty country on the planet they riot for this dumb sport yeah  this isn't even a good version of it it's good enough it's perfect look at them fucking just going 
[00:15:00]  crazy  i don't know it's it's it just seems very uncivilized  but they're trying to ban these horns from the stadium because people are really losing their minds  over it wow it's annoying to just hear it this long on youtube i cannot imagine sitting there  and hearing that we've listened for one minute i think yeah just imagine a couple hours straight 
[00:15:30]  it never stops wow how long is a soccer game i don't even know 90 minutes a half  45 minutes a half whole game whole game whole game i don't know i just hold game i just know  i'm watching and they go to commercials and they don't even stop the play i don't i i don't know  i'll tell you this much ronnie b is all in oh yeah because i talked to him after uh after the show  friday i'm like yeah is this world cup of goof with you he goes no he gets it he's into it they got 
[00:16:00]  brackets and they'll be discussing why i guess uh the usa england won one tie was a great game that's uh  what i was saying he knows way more about this than we do one would have been great one one stinks  yeah and and england uh let up a very very easy goal they were actually calling the goalie from  england uh bill buckner bill buckner was trending on twitter because of that guy letting that goal in  he'd have been killed if he was a soccer player who bill buckner oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah that would 
[00:16:30]  have been all over absolutely prime example of if we were as fucking crazy and savage uh as as some  of these soccer fans are uh he'd have been dead who else short list of athletes oh my god i would put  scott norwood in that category oh scott norwood uh found yeah cut in three pieces um in a dumpster  gotta go bill buckner yeah trying to think who else had the big breakdown yeah yeah that would have  um wow eddie you done uh i want to take that collar put him in the camel clutch break his back and 
[00:17:00]  fuck his ass oh yeah the iron chic hey hey change you should change your style there eddie we're  officially a nice guy we're officially done with the iron chic it was fun it was a nice goof thing  we did from time to time for the guy we had a nice run with him we sure did jay moore really set him  off i mean that was brilliant like jay moore but i'm a fan now it was a fucking perfect way to end our  association with the iron chic what else were we gonna do with the stupid fuck yeah how many times  could he piss his pants exactly so all right eddie thanks for trying to explain but uh i don't know 
[00:17:30]  oh god those horns that's like if we did the next two hours of radio with that in the background yeah  that's exactly how it was oh we should do that and i was i was i was trying to turn down the sound  but now i can't hear the announcers because i'm trying to learn a little bit about what the fuck  i'm watching i don't think you need the announcers do you i don't you just watch they kick it and then 
[00:18:00]  it goes into the goal and you know after a baseball game or a hockey game or a football game it's the  post-game show yeah it's very they explain like oh this and that and this it's very in-depth of what  could have happened what needed to happen oh if only they did this kick that ball away from them  i mean it doesn't seem like there's a thing going on that's what i'm saying post-game soccer  there's not much to talk about no there's really not much to talk about  shoo Travis has more annoying what is it called the vuvuzula vuvuzula the vuvuzula horn vuvuzula there 
[00:18:30]  should be no sport that has a vuvuzula horn but everyone is talking about the vuvuzula horns i'm  telling you they fucking they're terrible Travis let me hear your version of the vuvuzula vuvuzula horns  do you care that it wasn't the 
[00:19:00]  goalie and it was the defenseman that with the columbia thing the murder thing i could give  a shit whoever it was it was close enough we don't have we don't have to be exact all the time  on this show uncut so i guess that's what we got on the world cup in yeah i watched world cup 
[00:19:30]  coverage i watched you didn't watch and we're in the same boat yeah now i know the score i know what's  going to happen now at least i know that uh it's a whole thing with the brackets and a grouping and  this and who cares and i thought it was only a couple weeks i didn't know this went for a whole  month oh my god a month and the u.s doesn't even play for another another what nine days  that's a nice uh rest yeah that's a nice little break you get and you were talking about the nba 
[00:20:00]  playoffs why do you feel like it's going too long anthony because i remember watching some of the  nba playoffs and i think it was two months ago i i you might be about right i was in a hotel i know  that and i haven't been in a hotel in quite some time and i was at the bar watching the nba playoffs  and they're still going i understand you know we're one game away i guess yeah the celtics  got three two games three two game uh but but it's like jesus christ how long does this go well 
[00:20:30]  it's just about over it's a push in the middle of june for basketball and hockey just ended in june  it's gotta just get people like do they care anymore do they just like well it's a great series  and well no i understand this one is legendary this is i mean david stern is probably jerking  off every day he's so excited that he got boston and la in the finals yeah i i understand that 
[00:21:00]  completely excited about donald stearns you think is very happy yeah donald stearns everyone  donald stearns donald stearns so you're just not a basketball fan no no i'm i'm not but i did watch  like uh and i was interested at one point but then it just it just goes on too long these fucking  these fucking finals it started april 17th april 17th what the playoff yeah that was the first game  of the playoff holy shit that's two months ago just under two months ago there is no reason that's a 
[00:21:30]  mini season yeah no reason a finals a final fucking playoffs or whatever the fuck should go for that  long two months in the postseason that means basketball teams have been uh i've been in the  offseason for two months already sidelined sidelined for two months they forgot how to play at this point  i uh i don't i don't i can't i can't invest uh two months in the finals that's insanity 
[00:22:00]  baseball's not that long right a little over a month maybe yeah you got october and then maybe a  little bit of november and maybe october november september october late september yeah baseball ends  like october 1st second around then and then it goes till about november 1st yeah yeah so maybe about a  you guys always talk about how baseball is long hockey and basketball both longer than baseball oh 
[00:22:30]  i know what do you mean as far as as far as the entire season goes hockey starts in october and it  just ended oh i know you know eight months yeah basically eight months so we have this month and  then july and august and then it starts again yeah uh weird weird all right well the celtics beat the  lakers 92 86 uh chuck liddell ufc oh how got knocked out by uh rich franklin  poor chuck five seconds away from making it through that round he would have won the fight 
[00:23:00]  i mean that would have been the fight if you know why it looked to me like he uh smelt a little blood  he went in to do a little more damage and uh just stepped right into a fucking fist to the chin right  on the button as they say he went down and then got punched a few more times in the face but it was  the weak arm of a guy whose strong arm was broken laddell broke his arm with a kick yeah so that's  kind of a bad sign when a guy knocks you out with his weak arm he's obviously just fighting for his 
[00:23:30]  life at that point yeah that's a bad sign when you go in and get and get clipped like that it was right  on the chin though chuck was bringing his head in towards the guy and the fist was coming towards  chuck's chin and wow that was it five seconds to the end of the round and uh there's no way that  guy would have come back out rich franklin would not be able to come back that's just it it's like  his his arm was fucking broken yeah that was tough tough to watch uh that's gotta that's that's gonna  lead to some sleepless uh nights yeah knowing five seconds i thought liddell looked great i mean he was 
[00:24:00]  doing well he's throwing way more kicks than anybody expected i never expected him to throw the kicks  he was throwing he was doing a good job he rocked him a couple of times but uh yeah he looked really  lean and uh he knocked liddell out cold god he looked good literally the ice man getting iced  for the third consecutive fight and rich franklin despite breaking his left arm in the fight  where was the break in the left arm yeah no where was it kick it was right in the middle right in 
[00:24:30]  the middle of the forearm forearm and he got cut chuck got cut going in i think when it was  franklin was on it was taking him down i think chuck probably either ran into something  but uh it was after liddell had just put him on the ground he came up bleeding  so yeah well so what does that mean for chuck liddell i mean being that close to winning the  fight but he gets knocked out he's got to be done is that enough for him to go look i i can't go  out that way i need one more fight they won't give him another fight you don't think yeah i don't  think he'll uh fight again because even though like the fact that you could be doing that well 
[00:25:00]  and and get knocked espn didn't show the knockout they're showing the fucking fight and they're  showing rich franklin they're making it look like chuck got knocked out with a flurry instead of  showing the actual fucking punch and knocked him out maybe that's the deal uh they made with  ufc because it's on youtube i don't know oh maybe that's just a bad copy who knows maybe  who the fuck knows maybe we watched out before he hit the ground we watched it over my house in the 
[00:25:30]  uh in the theater oh this is fantastic yeah nice oh just fucking drinking a thousand beers that night  my god my god did i drink a lot of beer it was fun it was so drunk he was at one of these  you know man this motherfucker doesn't need to fight anymore was he really saying that  it was like that type of thing i was just like come on chuck your motherfucker  i was the the annoying guy i almost had to remove myself from my theater i was being boisterous 
[00:26:00]  boom yeah there's the knockout it was just you could see what franklin's not punching with his  hold man franklin's not punching with his left hand look at all right he's he's protecting his  left hand and then chuck's out like a light he got like when franklin's just fucking well you're  you got you got on top of him but you got adrenaline you don't even finish out cold at that point  right yeah oh okay we did we do have a clip of dana white talking about chuck liddell it's really  quick oh shit i don't know which all right we'll try after the uh fight yeah yeah yeah yeah it's 
[00:26:30]  quick did you have a chance to talk to him after the fight i didn't uh you know they took him right  out and he went to the hospital and and it was the end of the show so i ended up getting caught in the  arena i don't want to put you in this position again but after ufc 97 you said that was the last  time we'd see him fight again uh what about this time do you think this is the end for him i guarantee  you that tonight is the last night can you really don't guarantee it because you know how fighters are  they're persuasive do you really think you'll be able to convince them i guarantee you tonight was  the last night that's it that's it for chuck liddell yeah the fact that that he's had a couple in a row 
[00:27:00]  get knocked out like that that just shows you that three in a row yeah three in a row last three  for chuck and he looked great in that fight man those kicks i couldn't believe how much he was  fucking throwing kicks i was like god damn my really he looks really good yeah and he broke his arm  of the kick yeah i mean that was a great fucking kicker and the crow cop fight was good that made  me very happy yeah we thought he was a dead man in the first round oh god yeah he came back there  and just fucking did him in and then uh that was good yeah he looked heavier though he looked like

[00:33:30]  did you watch the world cup oh how about some world few games of the world cup yes sir yes  indeed and a world cup is very interesting it's a good game oh well all right so why is it  interesting uh it's uh just to see it's not just about the scoring it's about how they play the game  dribble the ball pass the ball try to attack the goal and defend the goal those things are pretty  interesting so you will you know it's not a high scoring game but it never gets to a point where 
[00:34:00]  they even have a scoring opportunity that's what drives me nuts well i was watching argentina and  they got that guy messy this fucking guy is amazing oh that means he must have seven goals  he must have about seven goals he didn't even have one see that's what i don't understand he's amazing  with no goals i know i sound like a complete idiot to real soccer fans but why is he amazing if he's  not scoring well you can see him dribble between players and shooting attacking the goal but in the end  he didn't even score you're right you're absolutely have any assists uh not that i know of so he had 
[00:34:30]  no assists no goals but he's amazing actually he did score i'm sorry he might have scored i'm not  you don't even know this is perfect this is a perfect example that's into it and still doesn't know  but i'm not a true fan you know i'm just looking at watching more of a fan than we are i couldn't even  name one player out there couldn't name one player one pele jesus how old are you how old is  try to make me believe we're younger than we are you guys know maradona right i've heard of the name 
[00:35:00]  yes i love ronaldo from brazil he he doesn't play still maradona's still around he coaches but he  doesn't he looks like a fucking mess long hair all right so you just explained it this guy's amazing  but uh he has no stats to prove it so i gotta take that back i think he did score can uh he might  have scored he might have scored does ronaldo still play i don't know ronaldo he was supposed to be a  great player yeah and you've been brazil and you're caught with like a tranny or something you got in 
[00:35:30]  trouble and he went to like italy how many players are in this world cup how many players  oh i don't know like 10 000 is that messy yes he's a white guy so he's amazing argentine argentinian  yeah and he's amazing and then and then and then argentinianian and then well good for uh good for 
[00:36:00]  well mars thank you for that in depth oh it's not over he plays for spain no because uh because uh  iraq was laughing he plays for spain he's not spanish no one's laughing that's the problem with  the show right now yeah iraq laughs at weird things anyway he'll see like he's watching  laughing cartoon one of the little cartoons runs across the bottom of the screen he just giggles  starts giggling it's called being dumb all right mars i know you tried but uh see we're not going to 
[00:36:30]  get anywhere with this world cup thing no like i said ronnie b knows about it he's there all the  brackets are set up they they know everything about players and what the fucking teams that  are going to be playing other teams and how much better that they are than the other ones i'm  going to listen what's going to be an upset oh i've been listening it's crazy i'm going to listen  today though because he will explain why the england usa won one tie was a great game was a great game  i understand we weren't supposed to beat england so tying them is a pretty big accomplishment that's  what i heard but i want to know why the actual game was exciting i was listening and that's what 
[00:37:00]  he was saying he says uh you know they they that if uh united states even gets a one one tie with  england and he said that that it would be a huge thing because england was the only one that had  something to lose there because we weren't even supposed to be there or something and that's all i  know get past england and that was because of ronnie b all right i have no idea why we play in the  sport why we even put if the best we could hope for is a one one tie with england what the fuck are we 
[00:37:30]  doing give up i i don't know forfeit no exactly play football it's more fun to watch yes this  country insists on making soccer popular they're trying to shoehorn it in they have been trying for  20 to 30 years at this point but they insist they'll continue until it becomes a popular sport  and the soccer fans in this country think it's huge in the united states because in their little world  it's huge right they're going with a couple of their friends and watching it or going to a bar where 
[00:38:00]  it's on and and watching it and they are in this little little world where they think everyone  in the country is all psyched and watching it when meanwhile the reality no we're not watching it if  we get into the final game or one or two games we could win the world cup then you'll see the whole  country will be interested right because the press will really be all over it and walking around  manhattan this weekend these bars are just packed because of the world cup where they're spilling out  onto the sidewalk and i'm telling you it's not all minorities anthony a large portion it's packed

You ain't going nowhere.  You aren't either.  You look for five, ten fucking years to know who's in the Hall of Fame.  Oh, you're going to be in the Hall of Fame.  You'll know it.  Why?

[00:51:00]  O.B. and Anthony.  Hi there.  Well, hi.  How was the weekend, Ant?  Nice.  Yeah.  Ah, nice and relaxing.  Fantastic.  Up by the, up by the Puel.  A little shitty as far as the weather goes, but what are you going to do? 
[00:51:30]  It only got shitty, what, yesterday afternoon?  Yeah.  Saturday was good, no?  It was nice, though.  I don't really know because I spent a lot of hours.  I don't have a cast.  I spent a lot of hours indoors these days.  It's the summer of indoors.  I'm getting some color.  Are you?  I'm getting some color.  Yeah, you know, like the moors.  Get a little color on you.  Yeah, a little colored.  The sun feels as good.  Feels as good.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know.  Crank the heater up so it's nice and toasty.  Nice and toasty warm. 
[00:52:00]  Mm-hmm.  And then, um...  See the horns of Africa.  It's everywhere, Ant.  The horns of Africa.  I'm telling you, it's everywhere.  Boy.  Players and networks say, make them stop.  I don't think they're going to be able to make them stop because it's their thing.  Jesus, look at that.  They just...  Oh, my God.  They are pretty much at the point where they're ready.  There's a montage on CNN.  Everyone's wearing their very festive hats to the World Cup.  There should just be bones through some people's noses. 
[00:52:30]  That's what I'm seeing here.  Oh, my God.  There's a whole nother world out there.  They're just talking about the horns.  They got to make the horns stop so people can enjoy the game.  A frightening, frightening sound.  Those horns.  I bet they're used before attacks.  The English colonists are just like, oh, no.  What have we done?  It's time to leave here.  Find out the history of that dumb horn.  I bet you it is based on some kind of hunting ritual. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, I'm sure it's based on some type of horrific thing that involves machetes and literal circumcisions.  They put on their wiener sticks, blow their horns, and then go after an elephant.  Their wiener sticks.  The big, long wiener sticks.  Oh, you got to love those.  You can't call them big.  They were just long wiener sticks.  They were tied up to their shoulder or some shit.  I don't really understand that because it seems like that would get in the way if you're trying to run through the bush and do some hunting.  Yeah, but it's so... 
[00:53:30]  Well, these tribes have to put on the wiener stick.  So traditional that they just need to have the wiener stick on all the time.  Do they have it on all the time?  Yeah, I think so.  Unless they're fucking.  And then they take the wiener stick off and beat the woman with it.  That's the woman beating stick it becomes.  You missed the horns, Jimmy.  Oh, what happened?  Now CNN's doing a thing on the horns.  Oh, good.  It's all about the horns today.  They should use the music bed underneath Wolf Blitzer in the Situation Room.  Oh, yeah.  That fucking horse's ass.  Is he the worst? 
[00:54:00]  Oh, yes.  Wolf Blitzer is the worst on CNN.  Although he finally has a situation with this oil spill.  Oh, of course he does.  At least he finally has a situation for his Situation Room.  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of things to put up on the screens, the various screens.  I did a little compound-y show Friday.  Yeah.  Yeah, just testing equipment out for about 20 people.  I didn't Twitter it.  I didn't do anything.  I just popped on.  You're back in with the live from the compound. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, I upgraded all the software.  I got some new little programs to use, so I was testing those out.  And then a few people just started, stragglers, started coming into the room.  I don't know how they even find it.  And then I was popping on there and just babbling about relationships and bullshit and all kinds of crap.  Relationships came up.  Yeah, you know, anything comes up.  Why relationships?  Because it's like something people wanted to talk about when I tested the phones out.  I was like, could someone call me, please? 
[00:55:00]  So they put the number up and they called.  There were only like 20 people in the room, so someone actually put on the chat, could you pick up your phone?  And I looked, and it was blinking.  I'm like, okay.  I picked it up.  And then it just gets into relationships and things.  But it was cool to get back in.  I guess when Joe Rogan was saying, you know, hey, when I come into New York, I want to do the compound show.  You got to get it all set up for.  Oh, shit.  Better get it started.  Fire it up.  I watch his podcast.  Don't worry about it. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  His is very primitive compared to yours.  Although what he's saying is great.  Don't get me wrong.  Yeah, I love Joe's house.  But he's got the basic setup right now with three very loud chairs.  Oh, really?  They squeak a lot?  There's some noise going on in Joe's house.  I'm sure he'll upgrade eventually.  I got to get some cool video things for my location shots so I can put scenery behind me.  Like, maybe I'll do a World Cup little motif.  That could be really funny.  Have people out there with their horns and just play the horns the whole time. 
[00:56:00]  And their decorative hats that we just saw.  Decorative hats.  On CNN.  That's great.  They were actually people's heads.  They were shrunken heads that they were wearing on their heads.  Good news for us broadcasters.  Adam Carolla?  Yeah.  Number one podcast in the world right now.  Oh, good for him.  He's beating out Ricky Gervais, although I don't think Ricky Gervais is doing as many  podcasts as he used to do.  How many listeners does he have, Carolla?  Iraq, what is it?  Over a million?  That's great. 
[00:56:30]  Over a million downloads?  Yeah, he's doing...  Last I heard was over a million.  He's doing really well.  Good.  And everyone is looking at Adam Carolla because this is where the future is going.  The future?  So you don't have to deal with fucking bosses.  What's the podcast?  As soon as Adam Carolla starts making money at this thing, wow, we're all in.  But what's the podcast like, because we're live, so what's the podcast like time of delay?  His is live.  You can do a live podcast?  How do you do that?  I believe his is live, and then you can download it from there, no?  If you didn't catch it live? 
[00:57:00]  Can you hear it live, though?  I'll be honest.  I've never heard the Adam Carolla podcast.  He's very popular, but I don't really like the guy.  You like Adam?  No, I don't really find him interesting at all, to be honest with you.  And is he on Ustream?  I don't know.  He streams through Ustream live, and then it's available for podcasts.  See, I've got to do that then, because I've got to tell you.  Ustream is really good.  That live stream is pissing me off.  No, go to Ustream. 
[00:57:30]  You know what they're doing now?  Live stream that pissed me off, and I didn't notice this because I haven't done a compound show in a while.  Every five to eight minutes, they pop in about a 30-second commercial, regardless of what you're saying, what you're watching.  What?  It just stops.  They put in a commercial, and then it takes up where you—so you miss 30 seconds.  What are you talking about?  That's ridiculous.  That's what I was saying.  I'm like, what the fuck is this?  Is that because you're doing it for free, and there's an option where if you pay, you won't get that? 
[00:58:00]  Oh, there's an option where you pay, but it would cost me probably $10,000 a month to run this, because I would use a shitload of bandwidth.  But most of the podcasts on live stream, you could do that, and you're not going to miss anything.  Yeah, you're not going to miss—  But real shows like you're trying to do, and Adam Carolla, and Joe Rogan, that's ridiculous.  So I'm going to try Ustream, and—  Yeah, Ustream's pretty cool.  See if I can do that.  And then it's a good idea, like, instead of having it just replay on Ustream, go to iTunes and upload the shows to iTunes. 
[00:58:30]  Mm-hmm.  And see if it works that way.  I'll give that a whirl.  Yeah, that's pretty smart.  Ustream, fuck that.  Yeah, but Adam's doing really, really well.  I mean, he's getting a lot of guests, and—  Yeah, I saw, like, he was getting—you know who else?  Tom Green.  Green's podcast is doing well?  Yeah, like, he's getting guests, like, real guests that sit there and do a fucking podcast from his living room. 
[00:59:00]  He told me he was—last time I saw Carolla, he said that his podcast, they put shows on sale for, like, live gigs, improv, or whatever.  And, I mean, they sell out immediately—it's not easy to sell out live shows just from, like, one or two plugs.  In one area.  Mm-hmm.  But his fucking go clean very quickly.  Yeah, I know he's really popular.  I just never really liked the guy.  And I met him once, and he was a complete fucking asshole to me, so maybe it just left a bad taste in my mouth.  You know, as his partner, Dr. Drew, couldn't have been nicer.  It was the weirdest fucking thing ever when I was in L.A. 
[00:59:30]  Didn't even do anything to the guy.  Oh, what are you doing here?  I'm sorry.  I was checking out your show.  We share the same agent, so.  That's probably what it's based on.  I probably should listen, and maybe it is good.  I don't know.  But I never got over that dumb thing, that dumb exchange.  Because we'd never even trashed a guy.  I mean, we never had even any history.  Mm-hmm.  We shared an agent, so Bob's like, hey, want to check out Lovelines?  I'm like, yeah, that'd be cool.  Sitting on a nice couch, watching those two do their thing.  It was a very good show.  They go to break, and Dr. Drew couldn't have been nicer. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  And I was like, and just kind of blew you off.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe he was in a bad mood.  Well, he said, what are you doing here?  And that was a question that he didn't even want answered and walked away.  Yeah.  To have a cigarette break or something.  So that's probably where I'm at with that.  Is he angry?  I don't know.  I don't know what it was.  I really don't know what it was.  In the sense that you think, like, I did his L.A. show a couple times when I was out  there, and it's like a weird vibe, like, I didn't think you liked me. 
[01:00:30]  Even though I was on his show, I didn't think you liked me.  I'm like, it was a weird thing, and then you talk to him, and it's like, okay, that's  just his way.  Like, you think that he's a certain way, but he's really, like, you think it's a negative  thing, but he just, like, seems a little distracted sometimes.  He blew me off at a party once, too.  Did he?  Yeah.  Oh, see?  Yeah, yeah, because I was like, hey, Adam, how are you doing?  I don't even remember what party or where it was.  I don't know.  Did we trash him?  We don't remember anything.  He's like, hey, and walked away.  Okay, fuck you.  Again, he never said that. 
[01:01:00]  I never asked him, but I'm guessing maybe he was a friend with Stern, and maybe he just  heard better.  Sometimes you hear stuff about people from a friend of yours or whatever, and who knows?  Like, well, you hear it from a third party, and you just assume.  Well, the funny thing is, the guy that we trashed, Dr. Drew, couldn't be nicer.  Yeah.  And if he walked down the hall right now, he would be just as nice.  So it's the weirdest thing.  You know who I found in the podcast world very recently?  And he's a fucking lunatic, Phil Hendry.  Oh, is he?  Phil Hendry is a really, really good broadcaster. 
[01:01:30]  Is he still on?  I found him on Twitter.  I don't know.  He's a lunatic to follow on Twitter.  And then he's got live podcasts, which I haven't really checked out yet.  I don't know.  I don't know if he's on regular radio or if he's also trying to do his own thing.  But he's fucking insane, Phil Hendry.  There it is.  Yeah, that's the site.  Jesus.  A lot of people are getting into the podcast.  Yeah, you get a VIP access and all sorts of things.  These guys got their own pages, too. 
[01:02:00]  So they don't.  What is this thing?  Joe from Staten Island's got info on Corolla and something about money.  Hey, Joe.  Joe?  Hey, guys.  Yeah, what's going on, man?  Corolla was on Stern last week, and he said he pays $10,000 a month for bandwidth for his podcast.  Oh, really?  Yeah, Adam actually pays.  But what does he get out of it?  Is there any commercials or anything?  No, that's the problem.  He's not really making money.  I mean, he has advertisers, and I'm sure it covers the $10,000, but still, he's trying to make a living.  So he's not making a lot of money off this. 
[01:02:30]  He gets two million downloads a week.  Oh, yeah.  Two and a half million.  Two and a half million downloads a week.  So he's got to be making something from that, does he?  Yeah, I'm sure he makes...  He also does live reads, and he does a full bunch of commercials.  Okay, so he's doing some commercials.  Yeah, everyone is looking at Adam Corolla, because if he can make it work, then this is going to be the thing.  And I'm telling you, it's not that profitable for him, still.  Yeah, he said he makes a dime.  They're like, do you make a dime on this?  He's like, yeah, just about a dime.  A dime.  If you could break even on your bandwidth cost. 
[01:03:00]  You're right there.  You're $10,000 in the hole every month.  But, yeah, it could just be one of those things where eventually someone will pick him up, and they'll pay the bandwidth cost.  He could just be smart where he's kind of treading water for a little while to show the strength of it.  The price of that bandwidth's got to come down.  Jesus fucking Christ.  It just costs so much money to put video out there.  Yeah, fuck.  That's where the money is.  Oh, is this a video podcast or audio?  Charging everyone bandwidth charges.  That's the landlord right there.  Doesn't Adam do a video, or...  I don't know. 
[01:03:30]  Sir, do you know?  He's gone.  I don't know where he was.  Oh, it's video.  I didn't realize that.  Okay.  Yeah.  So he has people on and stuff?  Yeah, he had, like, Stone Temple Pilots on his shit.  Huh?  He does a 90-minute podcast.  Oh, cool.  He got everybody that was fired from his show is back with him.  They come into his house, I guess, and they do it from there.  Oh, you know what?  I got actually...  I'm so stupid.  I was offered to do the...  He asked me to do it, but I think he's in Glendale or something.  I wasn't...  I didn't have time.  I had to go tape something. 
[01:04:00]  I'm like, what a dope I am.  All right.  Now that you know, he actually has a lot of fucking viewers with this thing.  Well, I should have done it anyway.  I'm just a dope.  Let's say hi to Ryan in Arizona.  Ryan.  Ryan.  Hey, guys.  Love the show.  Hey, listen.  I'm a huge fan of Adam Carolla, and I think what you guys are talking about, he always  addresses it.  He has a hard time talking to people for the first time.  He says he always gives people the wrong first impression.  I think that's what you guys are talking about.  Wow.  I'm a perfect example of that, because I was wondering, and I know I'm an asshole. 
[01:04:30]  I'm like, wow, this guy's a fucking asshole.  Well, I was being really nice and cordial, and he could care less.  And then I'm sitting there thinking, maybe me and Ann trashed him.  I don't think we did, though.  No, this goes so far back, I wouldn't even know.  Yeah, I don't remember.  This is when we got fired, and I was hanging out in L.A., so that's, what, six, seven years  ago now.  Yeah.  So you guys should probably get him on your show.  I bet you guys have hit it off really well.  He's awesome.  I'm sure.  We got a lot in common. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, I felt the same way the first time I was doing a show, and I'm like, I don't think  the guy likes me.  And it was a weird vibe.  But then...  But how do you get an audience being like that?  That's why I'm not interested in his podcast, because I'm like, he's sounding...  Well, most audiences don't meet you.  They just hear you talk for a couple hours.  No, I understand, but if it's that same attitude that he had toward me, I'm...  I don't know.  I don't know.  Maybe I'll give it another shot.  All right, Ryan.  Yeah, sometimes people...  Performers are weird, man.  It's like sometimes they're painfully shy, or... 
[01:05:30]  Voss gives a horrible first impression.  Ugh, last impression.  And everything in between.  That is true, especially if you're a casting director.  But when I did Leno with him, honestly, man, he couldn't have been nicer.  He could not.  You would come in the dressing room every time and talk, and, you know,  how you doing, and what are you going to talk about today?  And he was really very engaging.  Good kisser.  Good kisser.  That's nice.  Ralph in Rhode Island.  Ralph.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Ralph.  Phil Henry just retired recently.  He had a syndicated talk show on AM radio, about 20 states, 
[01:06:00]  and he did a talk radio show that all the guests were fake,  and none of the people...  No, they weren't.  What are you talking about, dude?  Ralph, are you telling me, Anthony, and Jim Norton,  or are you telling the audience?  Well, I'm telling all of you.  Dude, I know what he was about.  The only reason I let you keep going was so maybe the people out there  that don't know who he is just learn something.  Yeah, oh, so you guys do, too, then.  Yeah, he's one of the most unique guys to ever do radio. 
[01:06:30]  How?  I would sit there...  Because for many years, most people did not know that it was all fake.  He would have some weird guest on, and he was doing both voices.  How can you go through 20 years and people not figure that out?  I said there was a time when they did,  and then a lot of people caught on to the whole thing.  But at first, certainly most of his audience had no idea.  Oh, man, he was a riot.  All right, guys, have a good day, man.  But it looks like he's not retired,  because it looks like he's doing some kind of podcast on his own now.  He probably figured he could make more getting off of regular radio like you guys, bro. 
[01:07:00]  Well, that's the point we just made, that you just didn't hear.  No one's making money with their podcast yet.  All right, man.  It's very hard to...  What is this guy...  Do you have advice for me?  Where?  Line 7.  Yeah, I just want to hear what he has to say real quick.  Hey, what's up?  Oh, are you a girl?  Marie.  Yeah, Marie.  Looks like Marie in Florida.  Hi, Marie.  Hi, Marie.  Oh, hi, how are you?  I'm good.  No, I heard you were talking about a live stream in the commercial.  Yeah, what the fuck? 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, so live stream is doing a commercial 30 seconds in now,  and then, like you said, every five minutes, they're showing a 30-second ad.  Drives me nuts.  I've been complaining about it to them for months now,  but they're just basically saying, oh, there's nothing we can do.  It's pretty much what you're going to deal with when you're doing a live stream show now.  Yeah, well, I'm going to leave their service.  But do they give you an opportunity to know what's coming so you can maybe go, like we do here on the radio,  okay, we'll be right back after this? 
[01:08:00]  It says 20 seconds to commercial, and then they have a countdown.  Oh, so you see the countdown.  Yeah, but your commercials, they're not all lined up with everybody on the thing.  If it was, you could say, okay, I'm going to not say a word for 20 seconds while this spot's gone.  But some people could still hear you, and other people, it's not timed out where everyone gets the commercial at the same time.  I don't get it.  So at any given moment, somebody's in a commercial.  Yeah, I can't really figure it out.  I think it's...  Why can't they do it individually? 
[01:08:30]  So, like, you're doing your show.  Why can't you know specifically, okay, I've got to stop talking right now because here comes the commercial.  Because other people aren't getting the commercial at that time.  I think it's time.  I think it's time.  When people...  That doesn't make sense.  When you log in.  Yeah.  So it's, like, every five minutes for them.  That's just a dumb business plan.  It's really stupid.  They're dumb.  Who would deal with that shit if you're trying to, you know, get a little podcast together?  Yeah.  Wouldn't you go somewhere else that wouldn't do that or would make it a little easier for you? 
[01:09:00]  That's what I'm going to do.  Yeah, and by the way, for the iTunes thing, all you've got to do is turn on GarageBand while you're recording,  and then you can throw it up on iTunes when you're done.  Oh, really?  It'll record it on GarageBand?  Oh, fuck.  I didn't know that.  That's good to know.  Wait, what about the video?  The video?  No.  Oh, shit.  I mean, it's iTunes.  We don't have a video podcast, so you can see the audio.  Oh, shit.  I want video.  It's all about the video.  It's all about video.  I got a green screen, for God's sake.  It's my whole fucking...  If you figure that one out, let me know. 
[01:09:30]  All right.  All right, Marie.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Yeah, that's just dumb.  Livestream's got to get their ass to it.  Yeah, what the fuck?  They didn't used to do that.  What they used to do is they had little pop-ups that were, you know, an inch high on the bottom  of the video feed, and you'd click off of it, and every so often it would pop up, and you'd  click off of it, and then they went with the commercial, like a banana.  Yeah, a little banner.  A banana.  A banana.  A banana would have come up, and then they went with the, right when you logged in, you 
[01:10:00]  had to sit through one of their commercials, and then the video feed would start, and  you would watch the entire thing uninterrupted, and now they're going with every five to  eight minutes of fucking, the same, by the way, commercial comes on over and over  and over again.  They're going to lose a lot of people.  Yes, they are.  They're going to lose the people that actually are bringing in a lot of people.  You know what I mean?  If you're sitting there with just your friends who gives a shit, you'd be like, ah, whatever.  We're just fucking around anyway.  But if someone's trying to really structure a real podcast, why would you stay with them?  Yeah.  That's just a bad, bad business plan. 
[01:10:30]  Get into a nice conversation about something, and you're taking calls, and then you got to  be cut off from the show for 30 seconds?  That's bullshit.  That's bullshit.  The internet does not know how to do commercials yet.  No, they can't figure it out.  They're trying to figure out how to make money, because they got to make money off it.  Somehow, they just don't know how to do it yet.  But they can't do it like regular television does it, with commercial breaks like that.  Or it's got to be structured better.  I don't know what the answer is.  Why would you do the same shit that TV does? 
[01:11:00]  You know what I mean?  Why?  I don't mind sitting through a 20-second ad for a really good video, by the way.  Yeah.  I've gotten to that point.  I don't mind.  I'm not happy about it.  At the beginning.  But with that countdown thing, it makes it a little easier.  Like, your video will start in 17.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't mind that.  But you know that's only the beginning.  You know it's going to get a lot worse from there.  Because now they're going to go, well, all right, they're handling 20 seconds.  Let's go 40 seconds.  And even if...  Let's go to a minute before their video starts.  If they went every 15 minutes with a commercial spot, and it was the same time for everyone watching your show, and you knew when it was coming, then you could say, all right, commercial break's coming up. 
[01:11:30]  We'll be back in 30 seconds or a minute.  Sure.  And then you could just stop, wait, and then pop back on and go, all right, there.  Well, that sounds logical.  But to have everyone that's watching get the commercial at a different time...  That's ridiculous.  It's crazy.  At any given moment, someone isn't hearing what you're saying. 
[01:12:00]  That's fucking ridiculous.  You should try Ustream.  Ustream's pretty cool.  Yeah, I'm going to give that a whirl and see what their deal is.  All right.  I'm sure there's ads, but maybe it's not as obtrusive as...  What a terrible way to do it.  Intrusive.  Obtrusive, intrusive.  Intrusive.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Webster's.  Yes.  Webster's Jimmy.  Wolf Blitzer was horrible on Celebrity Jeopardy.  We did that audio already.  Thank you, Chris in Iowa.  He's just a zilch.  Get it, Chris.  Is he talking about the oil spill?  Where are we at with the oil spill? 
[01:12:30]  Oh, my God.  It's all cleaned up.  Oh, that's good to know.  Yeah, it's great.  All back to normal.  Yeah, yeah.  What's the headline there?  Because I chose to avoid oil spill crap.  Destroying some beaches, but Obama's going back down there to make an appearance.  Isn't he addressing the nation tomorrow?  Yeah, he's going to go down there.  The names of the people that he's going to kick their ass?  Yeah, he's got some asses to kick.  And he's finally got a list of names?  He wants BP to put up a few billion dollars in escrow for the cleanup and the people's 
[01:13:00]  jobs and all kinds of shit.  People are starting to really be affected now, these fishermen.  Of course, it sucks, believe me.  They're shucking these oysters that are just pouring goo out of them.  Are they really?  Yeah.  Already?  Yeah.  Not good.  So don't eat any erstes.  I had some scallops for the last time, I think, over the weekend.  It was wonderful.  I hate to say it, but I'm looking at fucking seafood very differently already. 
[01:13:30]  And you know it's coming from other places.  I understand that.  Yeah, you've got to get the seafood that's just from somewhere else.  And I'm sure that somewhere else has some unique problem to that area.  An old thermometer dumping ground.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Stores are putting signs up that say it's not from the Gulf?  How do you know the way you ask the oyster before you eat it?  Where are you from?  What's your home address?  Is that how oysters talk? 
[01:14:00]  Their mouth opens because of a knife being stuck into it.  Dopes.  Oysters are dopes.  So are clams.  They're no brain surgeons either.  No, they're not.  Flare.  That's clams.  Yeah, the White House is making some demands about the cleanup and BP's role in it.  What could they do?  The White House.  Seems like BP controls this situation, no?  Yeah, yeah, they really are letting BP kind of control this. 
[01:14:30]  And BP was a giant contributor to the Obama campaign.  Oops.  A lot of money went to the Obama campaign, a lot of support.  Oops.  Yeah, there seems to be a little bit of a conflict as to whose ass is being kicked and how much  that ass was being used in the election.  And so, a little, you know.  And everybody thought Bush was the one that was in bed with oil. 
[01:15:00]  They all are.  There's no American president that doesn't suck Saudi dick and take big oil money.  They all do.  Exactly.  I agree.  Good luck.  This Obama thing tomorrow night is going to be a lot of fun to watch.  Yeah.  Because there's going to be really no power behind what he's saying.  There's just a lot of things going on with the presidency that's just, I don't know,  it's really making it look like he's going to be a one-termer and set up for just disaster. 
[01:15:30]  He got into office and just the economy falls apart.  It was bad before he got there, though.  Yeah, it was just starting to teeter when he got in, and then it just really went down,  the economy and all these bailouts for the banks and stuff.  It just made him look bad.  Whether, you know, he had good intentions or not, I think a lot of this shit's going to  bite him in the ass, whether he was responsible or not.  You know, sometimes presidents got to pay for what happened during their presidency, and I 
[01:16:00]  think Obama and the Democrats are going to have to deal with that.  How was Clinton's first year, economically?  Shit, I don't remember.  I mean, does anybody out there know?  I don't remember, but maybe.  I think it was pretty good.  Clinton, like, uh...  I thought he took over a mess from Bush, too.  Did he take over a mess from Bush Sr., or am I not remembering that correctly?  Well, he took over a deficit, that's for sure, and then wound up getting a surplus.  How do we fuck that up?  And, uh, well...  We had a surplus!  What did we do?  A couple of wars.  That'll cost you a little bit of money. 
[01:16:30]  I think surpluses aren't that important, because they let them just go away.  Clinton was from the school of thought of, launch a couple of cruise missiles in, if  that doesn't work, just pull out.  Yeah, he didn't necessarily handle that well, but...  A couple of helicopters go down, get the fuck out of Somalia, and, you know, shouldn't  have been in there in the first place.  Agreed.  He was right to get out of Somalia.  Let them be...  Yeah, yeah.  Let them be the shithole they are.  We gave it a try.  Fuck them, it's not our problem.  And we were just there trying to help feed them, because all the Red Cross first aid supplies 
[01:17:00]  were going to the warlords, and the warlords were selling it, and people were still starving,  so we go there thinking, all right, we'll have the army there to dish out the food to  the people that need it, and it turns into a big clusterfuck, and, uh, yeah, he's just  like, yeah, get out of there, fuck it, fuck it.  None of our, uh, we should not involve ourselves in that crap anymore.  No, no, none of that stuff.  I don't care if a whole population of fucking white people is being starved at, or whoever  it is, fuck them.  Yeah. 
[01:17:30]  Fuck them.  Fuck it.  We always look like the dicks.  Yeah.  Well, big men on campus.  We have that complex, and, uh, people look at it poorly, especially when we're the only  one in town now.  Uh, no more Soviet Union.  Right.  That was always good, to kind of duke it out with them, and see who's on whose side.  Now we got China kind of emerging into this, uh, capitalist slash communist society, but,  um, I think it'll be a while before they, uh, become, um, a giant, uh, world powerhouse. 
[01:18:00]  There's still a little, they got too many people that are just living in the 1400s.  They seem to be well on their way, though.  Yeah, a few, a few people, a few of their people.  Most of their population, though, is just starving and shit.  They're peasants.  They, they don't own anything, uh, as far as phones or, like, nothing.  But once that starts changing, look out.  Your voice sounds a little scratchy.  A little bit.  Are you getting a...  No, I was, uh, I was yelling over the weekend. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, okay.  Remember?  No, I was talking a lot and yelling at Chuck Liddell.  Why would you yell at Chuck Liddell?  Uh, well, I was yelling for him.  I was like, come on, come on, Chuck.  A lot of people were...  Come on, hit him.  We're pushing for him.  All of us just sang into our chair.  I know.  Five seconds left, Chuck.  Oh, that was terrible.  That's painful, yeah.  Because that would have given Chuck fucking...  He would have come back and forth again.  That may have saved him from a one that really hurt him, though.  Like, because that may have said, like, fuck, see, I'm back. 
[01:19:00]  And then Dana's got to go, shit, you did break the guy's arm.  And then all of a sudden he gets in the ring with somebody who really hurts him.  So maybe...  Why are you blowing...  Jimmy walked up to the screen.  He's, like, he's blowing one of the fucking fighters.  Oh, yeah, during the...  Yeah, well, why wouldn't I?  Look how tall he is.  Look at his head's back.  Relax, he's enjoying it.  Someone commented on the look of enjoyment that the guy's got on his face.  Yeah, fuck that shoulder rub stuff.  I'm not gay, but if a guy needs a quick hummer before a fight, who am I to say no?  Anthony's giant...  It was like watching it at Lowe's. 
[01:19:30]  It was fun.  Except I had pretzels and I fucking shit Twizzlers when I got home.  So all I did was eat pretzels and Twizzlers.  Does Anthony have better snacks for you?  He might have.  I didn't ask.  I was too...  You guys, yeah, it was a little late, so I didn't have dinner or anything or food out.  Don't you have just snacks in the cupboards?  There's little sneaky snacks.  Yeah, we had some snacks.  Pretzels and Twizzlers and candy.  That's not snacks.  And Laffy Taffy and there's all kinds of...  Well, it's movie theater stuff.  Peanuts.  Oh, right, right, right, right.  One if you want it.  They were peanuts.  Peanuts.  Do they have a whole concession area now? 
[01:20:00]  Well, Ange makes sure all the things are filled with candy and stuff.  Oh, that's kind of cool.  Yeah.  And then I took about 30 pisses in Ange's pool, although I didn't say that.  I swam for...  Didn't you notice we were talking?  I'd be like, well, you know, I think the...  The key is to...  I would just tense up like I was having a stroke.  There's a very high turnover rate for the water.  I think it's okay.  I figured there would be, yeah.  But you know what, Anthony?  That's the mistake you're making.  Yeah.  I know you like your pool very warm. 
[01:20:30]  Very warm.  That makes people want to pee.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  You probably have a lot of urine in that pool.  I know.  You got the beer.  It's mine, too.  You got the kegs downstairs, and then you got the really warm pool.  That's a recipe for a lot of fucking urine.  What do you think?  I could sit there and down fucking six beers and knock it out of the pool once to take a piss?  No.  I'm fucking pissing right into the skimmer.  You should have that chemical, because that commercial they're showing for grown-ups where  they pee and the pool turns blue around them.  By the way, no such chemical. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, that's an urban myth.  Let's go to Snopes.  It's to scare people into not pissing, because they thought there was a chemical in the pool.  But in the commercial for grown-ups, they're all in the pool.  Yeah, yeah.  And the kids are all disgusted, because the grown-ups are peeing, and it's turning blue  around them.  Isn't that funny?  That movie fucking looks horrible.  Only if you piss blood.  Who's going to go see grown-ups?  I guess it's a kids' movie.  I'll see it for Colin, because Colin's got a decent partner. 
[01:21:30]  He's got a decent partner.  So why don't they show Colin in the commercials?  Because what they're showing is a bunch of horse shit.  Honestly, it's just the magnitude of those five names are pretty big.  It's hard to be...  Colin's a famous guy, but it's hard to be there with fucking Chris Rock and Kevin Jane.  I mean, they're all household names.  Yeah, but...  I hear he has a nice partner, so I'll see it just for him.  These guys are everywhere, too, promoting this movie.  I mean, fucking everywhere.  Except here.  Oh, they wouldn't come in.  On our show. 
[01:22:00]  Why would they?  Yeah.  Are they promoting here?  I don't know.  On this platform?  I don't know.  Oh, they are.  When?  Oh, my God.  What show are they doing?  Howard's?  All of them together?  Howard's is as much of a dick as we are when it comes to this shit.  It's all publicists.  It's not those guys.  Chris Rock, I'm sure, would do the show.  Chris Rock has done the show.  We've had Adam Sandler on a few times.  Look at Adam Sandler and Kevin James doing the NASCAR gentlemen start your engines at  the NASCAR race this weekend.  Fucking awful. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  Really?  Did you hear that?  I was talking with James.  I was asking him if we could...  We need to find what Ant was just talking about.  Yeah.  Could you repeat it?  Oh, oh, Adam Sandler and Kevin James did the gentlemen start your engines thing for NASCAR  over the weekend, and supposedly it was awful.  So we'll have to...  No, it was pretty good.  See that?  Yeah, yeah, pretty good stuff.  They're doing like all kinds of wacky things like that.  Have they done the wrestling thing?  I don't know. 
[01:23:00]  Did Sam say if they did Raw or one of those things where they come on and they'll take a chair?  Oh, I'm sure they want them to do that.  I don't know if they're going to say yes to it.  They're not just doing these standard interview things.  They're doing these, like, wacky going around...  Here's Adam Sandler and Kevin James.  Right before the NASCAR race.  So they mentioned the movie.  All the troops, overseas.  All the troops, overseas.  Gentlemen! 
[01:23:30]  Stop!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I'm just gonna say I think that might be the best command I've ever seen Kevin 
[01:24:00]  James and Adam Sandler doing it their own way they said it'd be great that sure  what the hell was that I look they're promoting a movie I look they're promoting a movie I don't 
[01:24:30]  care if they were promoting the second coming of Jesus Christ there is no reason to do that  for the record if they were promoting Christ that was Anthony saying that I'm all for JC popping  back in we'll take JC wow when it comes back I am um that was very embarrassing and douche chilly to  watch oh god I curled up like I got in the fetal position they're everywhere at they were during 
[01:25:00]  they had a little piece during the NBA finals which oh did they that too that was pretty  terrific maybe you can find that one too Iraq why are they really going basketball bullshit with  fucking showing up at all these things for this well history has shown Anthony yeah I'm glad you  asked that question all righty when you see uh overexposure like this for a movie oh they're  trying to get as many people to the theater for that first week as possible thinking a big drop 
[01:25:30]  off before the word her mouth gets out there that's what history has shown that's all I'm saying  ah that's all I'm saying this movie is going to make a hundred million dollars oh I know it's  going to do great but will be a good solid well-written movie that's the question you think though  because we'll have the same problem we did with uh what's his name Seth uh Seth Green was it  oh god his movie he he'll tell you the stupid he'll tell you how how great the movie actually 
[01:26:00]  was the river movie which was a shitty movie man we tried to call him on and he got really mad and  said you know how much money that movie made you know much there's two things though a movie makes  a lot of money but is it a good movie well-written you know what I mean exactly but you're right  it's gonna make a hundred million dollars like within two weeks I don't my thing is I've started  to doubt my own taste like I don't like I didn't see Paul Blart Mall Cop I just didn't see it I saw  it um it was horrendous it's probably not it's probably a little different than my style is honestly 
[01:26:30]  I'm I tended to like meaner shit there were there were two Mall Cop movies right you had the the Mall  Cop and then the one you turned me on Observe and Rapport with Ray Liotta and Seth Rogen that movie  was way funnier and uh give me the totals of those two movies Mall Cop was a monster for Kevin  James I did sit through Anna Faris was in it too I I sat through Mall Cop because I'm like all right  this is a huge movie everyone's like I hated that movie I didn't laugh once I actually had to turn  it off before I even saw your pal in there yeah Adam's in there Adam Farrar so and then I saw the 
[01:27:00]  other one I couldn't get enough of it saw it all the way to the end it was laughing my ass I laughed  out loud in the theater watching Observe and Report right I howled watching that movie right so that's a  very good look Ron Tomatoes gave uh Mall Cop 35 percent positive reviews right uh Mall Cop made  146 million 146 million do you want it for a comedy to make that kind of money that's I that's  Titanic that's the fucking Titanic man that's giant I made it almost to an hour into the movie without 
[01:27:30]  one laugh comedies don't make that one fucking laugh and it made how much again 140 146  all right and now Observe and Report uh what did Ron Tomatoes give Observe and Report just to be  worse it was mean 35 percent positive reviews from Mall Cop Observe and Report 51 percent positive  reviews better but not you know I'm gonna guess it made 30 35 million it made uh just shy of 24  million oh my god holy shit that's something yeah I'm with Jimmy I don't my tastes are yeah so so 
[01:28:00]  much different than mainstream because I thought Observe and Report was a way funnier movie  the dumber the comedy the more fucking money it will make and the more rubes will go see it  if it's if it's hacky not funny gimmicky things like that anything that we really don't like  it's gonna make a fucking fortune because the rubes run to see it and go oh it was so funny  really oh they did a joke about the fucking you know oh a dog came and bit the guy in the testicles 
[01:28:30]  and it hung on to him and he's running around with the dog on his balls really see anything like that  slapsticky will do much better because like like humor that's like meaner which is more a sensibility  is is more like specific whereas that movie with Mall Cop was he was kind of goofy and silly black  audiences are gonna like that spanish audiences white you get a much bigger crossover than you're  gonna have for the shit that I like which is you know did you see Mall Cop though I didn't know 
[01:29:00]  do you I mean I'll watch it do yourself a favor and try try to sit through but half the movie try  I saw it's really it's really hard to sit through not not good not good um Jason Ellis was in Mall Cop  I didn't get to his part either he must be in uh the movie later on because I I've had a bell  it was so god awful I watched a few movies that I hadn't seen uh kind of relatively new over the  weekend I saw that um that shutter island oh was that Leonardo DiCaprio movie about a bunch of 
[01:29:30]  windows that don't get blown out yes they're on an island and uh the windows exactly uh I thought  it was really good um although if you're watching it I'm not going to spoil anything if you're watching  you might think like all right you might start catching on to what's going on I think I might  start catching on to what's going on like this because this is what I I thought from the trailer 
[01:30:00]  oh really from the trailer yeah or is this uh because it was so obvious to me or is that's that's all  it is though or is there a twist from this point sorry there'll be there's there's twists but this is  the main well I I think I think it was obvious couldn't have possibly have not known that that  was gonna all right I got you yeah well you really are trying not to be dicks about there's a lot of  twists and it's just cool uh even if you kind of start figuring shit out um it's just kind of a cool 
[01:30:30]  movie watch that uh watch you realize sorry to jump in you realize how great of an actor he is  Leonardo I think he's great I was watching him no Jimmy doesn't like him you don't like him I love hate  him like there's times where I think he's tremendous and there's times I think he's really  bad like I used to I used to love him and then I've seen a lot of things where I just didn't like  him in I think I loved him in catch me if you can there's a lot of stuff I don't I was on I watched  that yesterday yeah I saw it in the gym yeah that movie is great I saw it in the gym while I was  working out oh Jimmy look out guys that make it about themselves yeah it was really good but I was 
[01:31:00]  doing the elliptical uh yeah I don't love him anymore I used to well I think that weird movie  what was it revolutionary road oh god fucking hated that movie you should see it so goddamn  depressing on there's no need for that check that out you dude you should see no need to get  that fucking sad watching a movie I thought it was terribly I didn't make me sad at all except for  the hell it was a it was a stage play it looked like put on film and it was horrendously active he 
[01:31:30]  was so miscast in that really yeah she was good but maybe it's not his fault although the movie's  worth watching just to see Kathy Bates's son in it that guy was amazing the guy that was in the  mental institute yeah I think he was good institution that came out that's funny well  just types up he always looks like a little kid wearing daddy's clothes Leonardo every movie he's  in whenever he's wearing a suit it's always too big for him and the tie is way too long we've just 
[01:32:00]  known him since like yeah you know you know him as an actor since he was that little kid when they  brought him in on that uh what tv show was he on growing growing pains was he on growing pains yeah  he was like a little fucking kid in growing he was the last season uh bring in the the oliver of  the show trying to get the ratings up and he was an absolute nobody yeah brought him into growing  and then gilbert grape kind of got him recognized because he was able to uh play retard basketball he  went full retard yes he did he went full retard basketball diaries was on recently i saw that  again but catch me if you can he plays a 17 year old though which is weird he doesn't look like a 
[01:32:30]  17 no he looks older but it was still enjoyable yeah with tom hanks that was hanks was good in that  so yeah the fucking relationship those two had throughout the whole movie was yeah that was  well done yeah i thought so too uh aviator i liked that i didn't see it i didn't see a thing that was uh  done really well is that scorsese uh i think so i'm pretty sure maybe it does a lot of scorsese  movies he's scorsese's boy yeah uh departed i like departed he was great departed wait getting 
[01:33:00]  back to shutter island when you liked it yeah yeah i liked it a lot i thought it was really good  ben kingsley is in there ben kingsley and then uh not a huge role but enough because anytime he's in  it weren't ted levine ted levine has a part in there he's just fucking it's like ah fucking ted levine  makes any movie better he really should be in everything he just rules ted levine  well get in the car and uh saw uh wolfman didn't see that one with benicio del toro that was a bomb 
[01:33:30]  it was a bomb not too bad oh you saw it yeah yeah i i was like uh some parts a little slow  um but some some nice uh disemboweling and stuff which is good that's what you look for in the  wolfman thing sure um so that wasn't too bad very good a couple of good movies though you know 
[01:34:00]  just sit around nice nasty day you just fucking flick around watch the movies you know what i'm  so confused by you but i just figured it out he's a queer  i could have called you that five years ago she'd have seen us in the pool kissing like  montgomery clipped and whatever brought he kissed on the beach  anna said three or four times this morning already about a shitty day yeah i'm sitting here like  where did he go away this weekend but see i'm getting up at six in the morning with a kid 
[01:34:30]  five six in the morning whatever and i wait uh to get up till about 12 with a kid well what  you obviously yesterday slept through the good part of the day i finally figured it out because  it was actually not a bad day yesterday in new york and then it got really shitty in the afternoon  so by the time you woke up it was a shitty day you're right because i'm i was confused by this whole  thing uh this morning like what is he talking about it was actually really nice in the morning 
[01:35:00]  i did kind of wake up for a few minutes early and looked out the window and i was like  ah it is a little sunny out could be a good day maybe i should get  and uh before i knew it it was probably three in the afternoon when i woke up that's when i didn't  get to sleep until like for saturday night into sunday went till the sun came up wow i mean the sun  was fucking coming up and uh that was just yeah i knew i would be sleeping for a long time yeah but 
[01:35:30]  you enjoyed your weekend you just enjoyed exactly at a different time made it seem like it lasted a  long time it was good i like those weekends that don't buzz right on by because you stay up for most  of it i hear yeah that's good speaking of movies really fast so we moved to the current movies uh the  karate kid was the big one beat out the a team 56 million yep jesus christ it's a monster i know  getting good reviews too i think it's like 69 oh why is it it got like one star on the daily news 
[01:36:00]  good reviews it's getting like 60 something in on rotten tomatoes that's 69 that's you know almost  uh just about seven out of ten reviews it all depends on the paper got one one star on the daily  news and you got five in jet yeah but that's why we go to rotten tomatoes because your local paper  could have a douche as a movie critic and and if you take his word you're not going to see movies  that actually in general are are better than what he's thinking rotten tomatoes taking all the reviews  across america and giving it one review you know so seven out of ten reviewers liking the karate kid 
[01:36:30]  and then the a team 26 million i don't know if that's good for that 52 52 positive reviews  and then you got shrek anyone watching the last shrek movie i think that fucking ship has sailed  yeah that ship has sailed certainly has yeah no one really cares about that in better news by the  way jean van der sloot that fucking dutch cunt oh is he scared in peru is he yeah wow he wants 
[01:37:00]  he wants to go to aruba this piece of shit is trying to use natalie holloway's body as a bargaining  chip yeah yeah to get him back to uh aruba he's like i'll uh i'll give you i'll tell you where her body  is if i can do my jail time in aruba no how about peru you motherfucker those peruvian prisons have  to be awful he's scared to death he's gonna be killed can we find out about peruvian jails  we need to know i saw lock up abroad on peruvian jails oh really they're really what do they do 
[01:37:30]  they make fucking san quentin look like the hilton they really are just horrid this is by the way  the uh van der sloot who reportedly fears for his safety inside the infamous miguel castro castro  prison said he will disclose information about holloway if he can go to aruba peruvian president  alan garcia said van der sloot will serve his prison sentence in peru according to radio netherlands  he's done the president the president when the president pipes up and says yeah you're staying 
[01:38:00]  yeah you're fucking in trouble oh my god look at this prison they don't care where her body is in  no and they shouldn't they just don't give a shit this is a peruvian jail  oh google image this one says nicaragua oh me it's pronounced niaragua niaragua niaragua  how about peru with the p we need to know about the peruvian jail system it's very fucking bad if it's  the one i'm thinking of i don't know if that's venezuela or not it's where they uh a lot of the 
[01:38:30]  times the prisoners have to fend for themselves in this weird jail community it's really bad man  he'll do well there they are they're fucking screaming murderer at him this fucking privileged  white kid goes to this third world country and commits a murder and he's already killed  what a dummy kills one of their own oh i hope they kill him in jail he'll be he'll be killed in a  i hope he's killed within two weeks they don't have protective custody well they'll put him in  protective custody might they might have that in peru yeah they do it's whoever's dick you're 
[01:39:00]  sucking if they're strong enough to protect you that dutch mouth will have a lot of peruvian  coming if he's not protective uh protective custody he'll be he'll be dead in the year  good what a great excellent have to be what true justice that is is if he just gets raped  and fucking murdered murdered in peru like hey see how did you like it you're a privileged kid  and you got the itch why would you have why would you do something about the itch in a third world  country right and he got away with another fucking country so you killed somebody you 
[01:39:30]  fucking piece of shit the whole world thinks you did it it's not like nobody thinks about you they  all think of him and he got away with it and then this scumbag five years to the day kill somebody  else couldn't help himself he's one of those just people that need to be killed because they love  killing yeah he's a he's a he's probably got a few more under his belt weaker he likes killing  weaker people of course weaker people one of those i think most people like killing weaker people 
[01:40:00]  though if you think about it yeah some serial killers like gay serial killers could they target  men like randy craft is a serial killer in california and he would kill like marines  it's like you know what i mean it's a be drug them first like domer i think a lot of times you  have to drug somebody but the domer always the domer yeah he was another yeah randy craft was a bad  boy yeah he liked to burn their nipples with the car cigarette lighter and put sticks in their  cockholes ow yeah he was what we call unpleasant sexy yeah oh unpleasant too what the fuck is that 
[01:40:30]  wow it was just a whole thing and then when they do these interviews with these uh lunatics it's just  stunning how as a matter of fact they are they're just like yeah well i don't know why i uh i do this  these uh these things and then you try to picture that person just with that mean face just ripping  someone apart it's very odd yeah i just i just knew i had the compulsion and uh yeah i would uh i would 
[01:41:00]  drug the victim and then i would uh torture him by wow i'll uh i shouldn't ever get out of prison i i  will absolutely go and and kill again i'm oh is that the miguel castro castro prison yeah let me see  that's where he would end up it's in the middle of that's great we have a satellite photo of it  is there how about something that's a little closer that shows the inmates it looks like the millennium  falcon kind of on the ground in the desert i'd like a picture where i could see like some of the  conditions iraq gets me one taken by the hubble yeah look at that that was actually taken by an 
[01:41:30]  alien wow there is nothing there oh steve c saying that yeah oh it said very isolated that they should  have sent his own picture creep looks like a picture of his asshole yes i have peruvian  foundry peruvian cam girls yes it was shaped like the logo that's why speaking of logo my favorite  channel it's the gay channel yes it is not even eight okay of course we're checking off a lot of our

[02:14:00]  steaks are being thrown in on top of that this is a healthy breakfast talking about the bread product  part of any nutritious breakfast we like to eat cigarettes why don't you just stop  why don't you just stop we'd like to go down to the gulf and drink us some oil from the ocean  sausage what an unhealthy man you gotta think fantastic you gotta think a lot of toast or  waffles or something there as well you just gotta think breakfast is their entire quota of everything 
[02:14:30]  for a week you know how much sodium they're getting per day we like to go to three mile island and breathe  in the fresh air and then we live here at the love canal  and then we drive through dearly plaza with our tops down  they're daredevils right they're daredevils you think they look a little swollen after their  breakfast you know they sit back in their chair and pat their fat bells and go oh that was good 
[02:15:00]  good sausage ma ma we got any more of them t-bones  t-bones i'll get you on raw they have to race to the bathroom and the men will actually  shit back to back in the tub the men will actually stand barefoot in the tub and shit like back-to-back  sumo wrestlers liquid shits are surrounding their feet we got sausage shits it's actually healthier  to eat cancer than we'll weed from breakfast uh let's go to john in wilmington john hey what's 
[02:15:30]  up guys good morning and then okay i got a math question for you there there's five people and  they used to have 16 ounces of sausages and they went down to 12 ounces of sausage which is only four  ounces so if they went back up to 16 they'd get less than an ounce each these motherfuckers are eating  12 eggs each and i get less than an ounce of sausage i mean well what what they're complaining  about obviously is they're not cutting down on their sausage intake yeah because they're now 12 
[02:16:00]  ounce sausages they have to buy more packs right that's his big complaint exactly big this guy is  not going on a sausage diet he's having as as much sausage as uh originally but it's costing him more  but it's costing him more that's his that's his big complaint what a family of just awful slobs  cut the malarkey randy i i fucking love randy i do too he rules with the breakfast with the fried eggs 
[02:16:30]  and the t-bone steaks and i can't see going to a little 12 ounce package like to feed four five six  people and i'm not going to buy two of those 12 ounce packages just because you want to downsize  and charge the same goddamn price i'd sure like a reply and i'd sure like you to go back to your 16  ounce package on your regular sausage because i'm not going to buy it otherwise ever again i'll just  have my own damn sauce made like i used to 30 something years ago it's not tasty as yours is but 
[02:17:00]  it'll work he had to give credit come on credit where credit's due it's not as tasty for that  extra four ounces i'll just make my own i'll slaughter my own pigs yeah i think this guy would blow jimmy  dean man it takes a lot of critters to critters to make farmer vincent fritters motel hell it's great  yeah rory calhoun we're going to have to kill us a prostitute and eat her arms and legs again 
[02:17:30]  sausage sausage now they are tasty even when he's complaining he can't he's got to continue with  the compliments oh yeah yeah as tasty as yours because you're a company i'm just a fatso let's  make his own he's out there in the shed grinding away with fucking sausage casings parts being all  filled up with some shitty doesn't taste like jimmy dean sausage sausage yeah now the guy made his own  sausage 30 years ago i'm i'm impressed he's still alive how is this guy still fucking alive he used to 
[02:18:00]  make his own sausage 30 years ago and he's still eating sausage google randy taylor a 500 cholesterol  count and he's still alive is there an update on good old randy taylor i want a fucking picture of  this guy you make that deal with jimmy dean yeah it's easy for you to say it ain't your sausage hey he  was as much of sausage casey to me as he was to you now he rock obviously there's a lot of randy  tailors in the world you got to put sausage in there there you go let's see if uh yeah  yeah the 12 ounce randy we hit jimmy dean at two o'clock it was a payback for the 12 ounce 
[02:18:30]  sausage package sonny got mad come on we got to find randy you have to quote you have to do randy  taylor in quotes yes and then jimmy dean sausage sausage do those before i spit my gum at your neck  very good immediately all right this should work see everyone wants to claim their uh  uh they're randy taylor there's a lot of different randy taylor's that come up on the google image 
[02:19:00]  and it's randy taylor he sure does like well if anyone has an update out there let us know  because we're having a tough time finally jimmy dean sent the hitman to his house they  fucking shot him with flaming arrows and a dr ian diet book one of your people get a  fucking hold of yourself fucking texas fatties another observation about the phone call from  uh jerry in uh wisconsin jerry jerry yeah the thing that you guys are realizing is because you're city  boys that they make the sausage of their bacon first and then all that two eggs and eggs are 
[02:19:30]  fried in the bacon grease or the sausage grease oh wow yeah yeah yeah we all could we could all enjoy  that but it sounds like they do this pretty much every morning every fucking morning they're  cracking two dozen eggs t-bone steaks 16 ounce sausage sausage oh this fat wife is there by the  stove making it you think and sits down and just shoves it in her fat face you think randy taylor drives 
[02:20:00]  his family crazy oh talking about sausage it's all about the sausage until he finally made the complaint  call they probably agree with her because she's in the back going it's for more money more money  it's for money they're making money she likes if she probably told her friends randy called jimmy  dean today let them really have it let them know let them know let them know you know something and  you yourself don't buy that jimmy dean sausage you because we're not going to buy it until they go  back to the 16 ounce packages but you see randy's wife packages we're not gluttons we don't mind 12 ounces of 
[02:20:30]  pig parts to breakfast could be the worst thing you could eat and if you're eating that whatever  it's fine you know whatever you want to do hey in moderation like once every fucking 10 years yeah  you know that then this is not an occasional t-bone steaks and fried eggs and i'm a texas man i don't  want to live past 37 are you saying they don't eat oatmeal the next day they're despicable fruit on  the side yeah they just probably did you probably just buy lard by the bucket and eat it what do you 
[02:21:00]  think what do you think their idea of uh a sensible breakfast is what he just said yeah that's a  sensible like no fucking clove no cake to cut down the cholesterol a little bit i'm sure there's like  a lot of toast and butter on everything like buttered toast and just and they salt everything  like that salt shaker is constantly during all of breakfast all you're hearing because somebody is  always salting something around the table they can't get enough of their sodium oh the sodium 
[02:21:30]  that they need sodium rules in that house they gotta bolt on a new toilet seat every fucking week from  those fat asses just snapping the bolts anything worse than a sodium dump oh sodium never had a  sodium dump you don't need a lot of salty fucking no oh it's the worst i hate to smell randy taylor's  oh god imagine they're all sitting there watching fucking hee haw at night and he just gasses one  fucking one of those one of those hot ones where your asshole stays open a long time and just stinks 
[02:22:00]  the room out and his wife waves the fucking idiot novel she's reading oh randy you didn't go and do  that some romance novel yeah trying to fantasize about her being skinny and wanted yeah it's got like a  picture of fabio on the front and a girl who looks nothing like her fabio inside the inside of her fat  thighs are all sticky with juices thinking about all excited hey but it's sausage i gotta jump in uh 
[02:22:30]  jordan writes is apparently an interview with the sausage guy on something called the will and jeff show  but i couldn't get through the annoying intro to confirm that really uh also uh jorma from rochester for  every two ounces this is two ounces of jimmy dean premium park sausage here's your here's your  stats calories 220 calories from fat that's for two ounces from fat yeah 190 total fat 21 grams of fat

[02:27:00]  to assume that we either played the complaint already or will play the complaint yeah if it happens  and you assume right oh yes you make an you make an ass out of you and me right assume i use it all  the time that's a good one that sucks if someone says assumption though because i gotta squeeze it in  oh chip i think we did the randy thing huh randy and that's why we uh played it over here  iraq instead of uh travis see you learned something today yes you did a two minute call just turned into 
[02:27:30]  40 minutes i like the fact that iraq has a beard like john rambo i really want to drive shave i'm  like they did in the movie i don't like your 40 that's a six day beard is it about six days  four days four days it's all spotty it looks like someone took glue and rolled hair in it and just  threw it on his face yeah it would be nice to hear from uh randy i wonder if there's a response 
[02:28:00]  online yeah was that another dead end by the listeners no there's an interview there but the  the way they encoded it i can't skim through it and it's like 16 and a half minutes let it play until  we come back and just people play it yeah figure it out while we were in break see if we get to the  park anything new from randy yeah we're obsessed with randy about his sausages this might be gold  if we get this fat get through the interview and get us to a spot we could use and we'll uh  try to play that next you know the 13 year old daughter's huge oh what a piggy slob braces 
[02:28:30]  perfect the opian anthony show on the virus sirius xm  back rocking there we are  you know we do that time is a bitch thing we certainly do a couple things  donald trump 64 whatever yeah that's not gonna be the one that gets you no that figures yeah boy 
[02:29:00]  george 49 yeah not really right for hockey fans being an islanders fan rangers won the stanley cup  16 years ago it seems like yesterday to me what 16 years ago is when the rangers finally won their  stanley cup they ended that long streak of not winning that was 16 that's already 16 years ago  that's what 94 what happened 1994 94 was 16 years ago 16 years ago i know the 
[02:29:30]  math is easy enough but i just can't that's when we got together that's right uh wow and uh  uh this is the one that gets you though paul mccartney a little little guy named paul mccartney  yeah recorded yesterday yesterday i thought it was like uh recorded years ago good was it that song  bling ling ling with 45 years ago yesterday was that that's how old yesterday is that's like crazy 
[02:30:00]  shit 45 years ago update bobo not today sorry buddy not today how to go to the emergency room though why  does he make it he always does shit that we have to take i don't want to  how about real quickly see what it is and then hang up on him  let the record state that anthony is requesting the bobo fucking phone call i just i just want to know 
[02:30:30]  what's wrong because for some reason when there's something wrong with the show they have to blame me  so let it be uh state oh that anthony wants bobo on the show okay okay since i want to be on the  uh have him on the show i will control how this segment goes perfect okay here here it is  we'll take the call all right bobo they they found calcium deposits in my kidney all right they  found calcium deposit in your kidney thanks all right i i understand what all that was it i got 
[02:31:00]  you that's all i wanted to do all right that was it perfect there's our bobo update perfect but  that is going to be too much bobo for some people yeah that was it all right calcium deposit in his  kidney so now look is that bad i don't know iraq now can look that up online and we can find out  for ourselves right and see what it is oh they're kidney stones that hurt they hurt but you know why 
[02:31:30]  why does he call them calcium deposits if they're kidney stones you have calcium deposits yeah when  you uh have to piss those out my brother had those and he was oh my god that his cock has been through  enough now fucking big kidney stones oh my god just fucking oh continues pounding that cock it is  it's not it's bad enough when it's got to go through a straight dick his is like a crazy straw  things got a whip through there and what's gonna get chewed apart let me ask you this 
[02:32:00]  and we all know about bobo's dick he's had 50 something surgeries i think 47 something right  okay now he's got to pass kidney stones so that tiny little pee hole of his yeah what's worse  listening to him on the phone having bobo's cock and going through all that shit or having someone  just repeatedly hit your cock with a hammer what's worse what would would what would be worse i think  having bobo's dick is way worse what if the the uh the hammer pounding thing was i don't know like 
[02:32:30]  for well no one could do it for an hour no one would be way too many times but it's like the pain would  be once one good solid hammer yeah yeah or deal with bobo's what bobo's been dealing with i can't  really think of either what's the um what's the what is the dick on when it's getting hit by the  hammer is it on foam rubber or slate uh yeah yeah like a slate floor like a slate floor so that would 
[02:33:00]  do permanent fucking damage and one shot to your ball bag too what the hell can i opt for neither of  these options yes you can yeah i think uh chris on long island chris hey what's up guys how are you  pretty good listen i don't know if anybody saw the uh yankee game on saturday but the guys had a  huge plug for bill bar one of the announcers said he was going to see bill bar and uh how beautiful  talked about him for like five minutes it was pretty cool yeah i guess he did very well with 
[02:33:30]  his carolines uh shows so that's good yeah they said they were going that night so i i don't know  their names i'm not a real big baseball fan uh paul and something else they were in the booth  hargus paul hargus that's right yes paul hargus that's right all right guys have a good day hey  thank you man i thought there was more to that too but all right uh yesterday was recorded 45 years  ago today paul mccartney the beatles it's a paul mccartney song but that's huge but now yoko ono  for some reason pretty much owns the song that other 16 years ago thing was was more like rangers 
[02:34:00]  when when in the stanley cup 16 years ago 16 years ago that was wow i remember i was working i was  working at uh saint uh saint uh uh john's hospital in smithtown and uh the big uh everybody was  excited and the big newspaper headlines about the rangers winning i can't remember it was yesterday  two days ago there you go 16 years there the fuck you go jesus fuck and uh i'm just going to read how  this is on the paper auschwitz auschwitz auschwitz yeah yeah uh auschwitz it's written this way today 
[02:34:30]  anthony was opened for business 70 years ago today for business that's great i did not write that  sound like a fucking uh opened amusement park for business 70 years ago sounds like it's a place  to store or something you buy something oh oh  oh  wow that is something that's a long time ago yes it certainly is oh you want to get into the racist 
[02:35:00]  twitter guy yeah what's what i think we need sam for this this is yeah get get stupid sam  oh god what just apologized to myself what happened why are you apologizing because i was going  through a dialogue in my head literally had nothing to do with a dialogue in your head 
[02:35:30]  why are you apologizing it wasn't i was correcting something no no no with yourself no no i was going  through a conversation i had i'm sorry i just literally was with somebody else and you realized  you were wrong no no just corrected something not even it wasn't an argument i feel just crazy right  now i'm in a crazy moment oh really you had like an insane i had like a crazy person moment there  i was talking to myself i actually answered myself out loud on the radio  i love i love people that talk to themselves i uh i fucking love them sam how are you sir very 
[02:36:00]  well how's everybody doing this morning how's our old friend dave doing dave is doing  well uh he's still remaining very positive he is going to be going to some kind of country music  festival in buffalo what what is that about money kids for money oh for money like an appearance yeah  he'll be doing a gig up there uh oh christ i guess he's gonna try to get people to drink he's 
[02:36:30]  gonna be in the drinking tent trying to get people to buy beer oh my god who hired him some listener  oh that always works out um i hope he's getting his money up front he uh he went on an interview to  be an assistant manager at costco in neptune new jersey assistant to the assistant manager  that's just as good as working for ron and fez yeah yeah uh just as good right he's got a couple  things on his plate and he's i'm starting to think he made the wrong decision yeah well um although he 
[02:37:00]  still gets to do a little radio with you sam yes but still no offense but i mean he did have a  full-time job in radio no none taken i mean and benefits he had some benefits here and how do you  give up your insurance when you have two sick kids well just one kid is sick at the moment i'm sorry  yeah i know that did we're both sick at one time no i mean i'm sure the two-year-old has had  sicknesses but okay i'm sorry so he has one sick kid that he's really worried about no joke and um  this company here serious i always every time i have to mention the company i actually look behind 
[02:37:30]  anthony to remind myself where i work where you work i'm not even i go oh yes serious xm i don't  know why i do that every fucking time so when he was working full-time for ron and fez here at  serious xm uh he was getting insurance yes he was you know full medical and and if you're 20 some  odd year old and you have no family not having insurance who gives a fuck let's be honest we all  live that way for many years but when you have a sick kid yeah you really should be thinking how 
[02:38:00]  you're gonna pay for the bills you need some cutbacks yeah you can't just drop your insurance like that  yeah i don't know exactly what he's planning on doing insurance wise i think he's hoping  that he lands a job by the end of the month that gives him full insurance and that there's no reason  to go to the hospital this month well that's good because uh that's great that's the plan  unemployment isn't running rampant at uh just about ten percent in this country and uh it's so easy to 
[02:38:30]  get jobs especially ones that are willing to give benefits oh it is oh not at all so it's really  it's very easy and unfortunately unemployment you don't get it if you quit  so all i had to you get it if you get laid off so why didn't he mother fuck somebody  he just mother fuck someone and they finally go all right you're fired he did ronnie  that's true but he's not getting unemployment from ronnie ronnie b ain't gonna give him no  fucking no he ain't getting no benefits from ronnie b he wouldn't uh give him anything 
[02:39:00]  no i mean all right you earn your keep on so he has no insurance and he might be an assistant manager  at costco's he's looking into it looking at assistant manager at costco because a listener  uh who worked at the costco you might have to work for a listener oh god no offense but no um  the listeners are scum why don't you pick uh pick that up we got something we need restock the tide 
[02:39:30]  in aisle 83 could you do that let's walk through this anthony okay at first it's cool for everybody  because it's like a listener going holy shit fucking east side i get to see him every day  when does it go out to everybody though the listeners gonna be like you see that guy down  there and there'll be dave in his costco uniform like with the little forklift handy thing and his  blue vest and uh the the listener will be like see that you know who that is that's east side dave from  the ronnie fes show he's working for me now yeah the listeners friends will come by and be like watch 
[02:40:00]  this hey dave and start bossing him around bossing around yeah yeah or make him do like some of the  bits he did yeah on the show that crazy yeah do something like crazy that you would do yeah this  is like eastbound and down very good travis you guys don't watch eastbound and down is it still on  i guess it was coming finally yeah it's been off the air for well over a year i'm thinking nice to  to see a lot of shows get season two good yeah it really is a good show though i've never seen 
[02:40:30]  down with danny mcbride yeah danny mcbride is a fucking rock star now so uh and then it goes bad  obviously and great all right yeah but for now east side dave is uh maintaining his sanity by i guess  just doing the show on saturday and let it be known the company should have done the right thing  we don't have to like or more of the right thing than they were offering yes yeah they didn't even  come close to doing the right thing by dave dave had even close he's in the process of the paperwork 
[02:41:00]  being shifted over to move from full-time employee to part-time but now he's in limbo and so uh he  actually had to call me because i had to let him into the building as my guest what are they doing  around here tonight what is sir saturday what are they doing around here so technically he's not in  the system right now you would know he's not an employee because he quit and they and the  paperwork to make him part-time hasn't gone through what are they doing you guys just give  him a little extra money they're trying but what are they yeah to do what to give him uh part-time 
[02:41:30]  status so they'll pay him for the hours he puts in on saturday how about just a raise how many hours  does he put in on saturday give the fucking guy a raise and put him back in ron and fez where he  belongs honestly you got to uh are they gonna give him a hundred thousand an hour i mean come  on you got to do the right thing sometimes man and there's something like dave did what above and  beyond for a long time and i think that you got to take care of a guy yes but his contract said 
[02:42:00]  that he was producer and not on-air talent so what just everyone knows he was an on-air change it  oh my god because the contract cannot be changed everyone knows he was on-air  talent when's his contract up enough when was his contract up well i mean we don't you know we  don't have it's up now contract times that are up it's always up but ron and fez's contract i don't  know it was up a few months ago they re-signed though the dave but dave didn't re-sign right  because i mean we're so why couldn't he become a member why couldn't he become on-air staff the 
[02:42:30]  company probably would have said we're already paying two on-air guys but see they're the company  they could do whatever they want and yeah it's obvious that they that he's an on-air talent for ron and  fez and they uh was it's exhausting whatever whatever whatever yeah i don't know why they  couldn't just say you're a raise and then give him extra duty as a guy who's whatever on your  talent yeah yeah yeah east side dave is going to be like mickey rorick at the meat counter  at the deli counter at the supermarket oh here we go here's your cold cuts 
[02:43:00]  maybe they didn't like do they not like dave i mean i don't know the story  no if they didn't like dave they could have easily uh not let it back in the building it's  just how they do things around here which i don't i don't understand yeah i don't get that either i  don't understand and i don't need anyone to try to explain it to me because i'll never understand  guy is a very important part of the ron and fez show so you look past the rules and you do the right  thing yeah well you just make it there's always a way to fix it with the rules when you're not doing 
[02:43:30]  anything wrong like if you want to just give the guy his on air and producer duty give him double  duty yeah all right anyway so he's doing okay that's the east side dave up yeah he's doing just  fine okay he's not doing fine for the time being doing terrible he's living day to day right now  you can't do that when you have a hand of mouth and a mouth you could do that if you just graduated  college you can't do that with a sick kid exactly he has a third grade education  you just can't do that he's very proud of his education at monmouth university couldn't he do 
[02:44:00]  gigs or something like live gigs to have supplemented his income yeah i mean like with ron and fez  couldn't he have done some live appearances or done some stuff for sponsors was there no call for that  or was he not good at arranging that uh he comment he said that when it came time to doing side things  that because he lived so far away from the city and because he he he needed to be at home with his  family he didn't have time to to do a lot of like side nighttime well does his wife work is she busy 
[02:44:30]  or she does not work then dave can then he could do some side stuff yeah i mean that would that would  be better than nothing but still yeah the money he's gonna make at costco it's a way bigger issue  the comedy should have just stepped up i don't know why they don't whatever um i i have no clue  i don't know either i'll keep my mouth i'm just saying for dave's sake why did he do some uh  some gigs or be creative there's a way to make money with a guy who's on the radio if he's willing  to he did get to the point where he got so desperate he just couldn't afford to come 
[02:45:00]  into the city what is it a two-hour bus ride every day or an hour and a half each way oh i should have  paid him to suck my dick how great would that be all right anyway sam why do we really have you in well  because uh i think steve said he was grabbing this intern i don't know where he's at right now  but uh about the ass i was holding his waist two gay jokes of course but it was pointed out to us 
[02:45:30]  that uh intern this kid intern derrick who's one of our new interns hi derrick to reduce confusion  he was named falcon because we already have it derrick uh give him a mic can you come over  first thing i gotta ask you wait wait wait should we play this though first well that's sort of we  should we're gonna lead to this yeah okay all right first thing i'm a middle relief pitcher  yeah he really does i gotta ask are you are you stoned right now not at all

[02:47:30]  on your right arm and you're a green band on your left arm what are those well this is for um organ  donation that's the left green one this is for um live strong for the um they gotta run the uh right  lance armstrong who do you know that has testicle cancer nobody but um my grandmother's uh survived  one cancer twice so i okay she still smoke no she actually never smoked a day in her life all right  and how about the one on the left the uh what's that one organ donor yeah my uncle died because 
[02:48:00]  he couldn't get a liver transplant so i always support that one for him oh are you uh organ donor yes i am  yeah you donate your voice box to an eight-year-old girl  so a good one yeah that is a very good one thank you someone wants to know if he's 17 inches tall no  he's not oh that's steven from bayshore 17 inches no he's not 17 inches tall steven  you're a normal kid you like to go skateboarding and bike ride yeah this one's for progeria we're  gonna hide yeah yeah it's uh i didn't see that is kind of a high voice but yeah we already went past 
[02:48:30]  that now uh the reason you're in here right i see you're an avid twitterer you like tweeting a lot  yeah um you have no friends well it's people with friends without friends i've noticed a lot of people  tweet everybody's doing it these days some more so than others some uh a lot some a little some are  very entertaining some never entertaining right uh i know i tend to i i people are on to me now 
[02:49:00]  because when i twitter more than three in the period of like one or two hours people go oh anthony's  been drinking he's twittering and uh this by the way is true i will tweet more after i've been drinking  uh just i find things a little more interesting so uh you on the other hand 
[02:49:30]  just tweet all the time definitely yeah he loves it i do love it it's uh a way of venting getting  all the steam out of my brain yeah yeah that's that's good but do you give any thought to what  you're twittering not and and the thought of consequences not at all of what you're doing  because some some of your tweets don't seem very thought out as far as the consequences that could  happen from them what's your twitter name uh derek d-e-r-e-k 7-1-2 oh i thought you had just 
[02:50:00]  derek i would have been really impressed wow damn i got it on the ground floor there wow that would be  very impressive uh there his his tweets are a bit dangerous anthony yeah yeah it was it was pointed  out to us early on the other interns love buzz actually threw him under the bus hard uh he found  these love buzz is the one that found him and ratted him out and brought him to the table is he here  today that that love buzz i don't think love buzz is here not to be trusted no he is out for himself 
[02:50:30]  period well love buzz went to the period where he realized he was getting thrown under the bus  every time he came into the studio yeah so unless he threw someone else under the bus it was just  going to continue you gotta shit on if you're being shit on you gotta shit on someone exactly and so we  brought in and actually the clip is uh derek his tweets are very racist so these are actually racist  and uh you were anthony reprimanding sort of saying don't you think this is a little unacceptable yeah 
[02:51:00]  yeah yeah yeah and there's a clip of of who inspired him oh really he's actually kind of  blaming oh oh there's a blame factor there kind of for somebody we got a clip actually kind of right  who's it who's at fault really that's what sam's getting at yeah was this from the sam and dave show  yes a little credit for you guys all right i just wanted to be uh a little different i feel like  someone's inspired by the shock jocks is that what it is definitely definitely okay so you think uh 
[02:51:30]  who who inspires you to have tweets like this  the open anthony show man  but who specifically who specifically anthony kumia okay that's my hero okay great good to know  good to know he sort of looks like he could be your cousin or something too  a little bit with a horrendous mustache he's got kind of a kumia look to him the um first of all it 
[02:52:00]  is so good to hear that dave lunatic laugh what a fucking insane human being he is crazy  um just wants everyone fucking down and out like him yeah and and as far as uh the inspiration goes  i i'm honored but uh if you've noticed whenever i tweet or even talk on the air and stuff there's  a way of putting things where you can get your point across without being so blatant as using words 
[02:52:30]  and i quote from one of your tweets um nigglet i think that could be found offensive that's right  his name is sam and yes it could be found to be offensive to certain people um uh spook was another  word i saw you tweet tweet a lot yeah you use that or spook town or spookville i have no filter 
[02:53:00]  that's my problem no filter oh you're crazy he's well  we got a crazy watch out watch out look out um then there was something i can't i won't even  say but you you refer to the president of the united states of america barack hussein obama  as obama all right here let me let me get this let me let me get this two seconds i'll get this  it's very easy uh it's easier this way why was arian warrior suspended everyone will know what 
[02:53:30]  i mean my what do you mean he was suspended uh wait he calls him obama yes that is  what you call the president i didn't call him that that was actually quoted from a homeless guy that  was on the floor train when i was on the way to your uh you actually you didn't say homeless guy  well queen you said homeless spook yes you used the word spook you use so many racist words in your 
[02:54:00]  tweets that you can probably get in trouble where are these i don't see them i printed them out because  they're uh they're all over the place we got the best of his tweets in front of you we should go  right from the top all the way to the fucking bottom with this kid because maybe there's  justification for each and every one yeah and you want to go with that the first one there yeah  yeah the first things are for this is i guess is from a topic one of the twitter topics oh and 
[02:54:30]  let's play this sorry which ones you don't mind okay because i bet you there's some tweets in here  you wouldn't mind probably starts with the most recent of course all right and this is a hash mark  things white people do mm-hmm and then his answer is pay their bills so they have heat and ac  about 14 hours ago that's when that was when it happened yeah via you okay so i'll just say the pay  bills so they have heat and ac assuming that white people do that okay and you didn't really say anything 
[02:55:00]  bad about right any other race in there you could assume what you want but yeah do you mind that uh  tweet it no no that's okay it doesn't mind that one uh straight a here's another one straight a's  now i know how chinese kids feel till they end up selling cds for five bucks a pop and collecting  soda cans from the trash oh my god well it looks like you're not going to work for cbs radio anytime  soon with that chinese humor wow it's fine though but uh that yeah who cares that's fine make it 
[02:55:30]  for the chinese here's another one fuck a lot of k's fuck it's gotta be a bunch by the way after  the bunch of yous you don't go fuck yeah not only do i gotta deal with the fucking canadians of  spookville but now a psycho schizo fuck i only seem to attract psychos now you might have to elaborate  on that one a little bit how many canadians are in spooks yeah what uh why would canadians being 
[02:56:00]  in spookville i use for uh african americans no canadians well no one would see through that  like canadians why would you use a code word when you called it spookville yeah exactly that gives it  away so you might as well just go all in when you say remember no filter obama it's it's a little much  you know uh let's see these and here's where he uses uh nigglets these nigglets need to pull their 
[02:56:30]  pants up disgusting hoods and their retarded style at least wipe your ass i don't need to see skid mark  boxers now where are you seeing this on the uh staten island ferry and so you take the staten island ferry  yes sir every day yes sir and um you see a lot of uh as you put it nigglets on the staten island ferry  well it's free so you see a lot of uh crazies on there including the skid mark boxes okay you 
[02:57:00]  actually see skid mark boxes yes i did okay you said crazies just now which would have been okay but in  the tweet you didn't use the word crazy no no you didn't used a different now that one show term  that one opie is a little rough okay this guy goes from making a good point in the next one  to just getting silly but did you guys read the haitian one oh yeah i was i just skipped that one  uh it says ah i get to work with the dumb haitian today now i know why that poor country's in bad shape 
[02:57:30]  who's the dumb haitian my supervisor thought it was the earthquake smart does he follow you on twitter  her no his friend does though we should let him read these you want to yeah he should read his own  uh sure okay which one would you like me to read well we just read these two so we're right there  i've learned which is actually a good point yes well this one says if i've learned that if a girl  tells you she's taking a shit she's not into you maybe try a black girl not that desperate yet  now you made a good point i've learned that if a girl tells you she's taking a shit she's not into you 
[02:58:00]  you probably should have stopped there because that's an excellent point what is that based on  every girl you ever met told him she was shitting i don't think i've ever had a girl say to me that  i have over my mouth what what is that based on you were interested in a girl you called her and  she said that we were talking and she actually would tell me like i'd be like oh what you doing  and she's like oh i'm taking a mean shit right now so she's brutally honest she's brutally honest  and she also slashed my ties so she turned out to be a schizo you'd like the schizo all right 
[02:58:30]  and then uh you went right for the black girl thing all right yeah all right this one uh wow  what's the next one wow i uh well i don't know what word that is yeah already bill the homeless spook  told me you know you spelled minority a little weird there yeah yeah my non it's maimonides you  pretty much spelled my not it minoytai minoytai minoytai yes no tie yeah okay okay okay so i went 
[02:59:00]  minority bill the homeless spook told me obama is killing the silverfish that's not  let's be brave remember no filter derrick you said no filter i don't want to get you  i don't want to get you guys in trouble that i can say that you say what you want i didn't  fucking write it all right minority homeless spook told me obama nigger is killing the silverfish  also known as dolphins all his words i only added the word spooks thank you fortune now  what do you have against obama yeah why would you call him that i didn't call that that's what 
[02:59:30]  the guy on the train called him i don't like obama but i didn't call him that i call him something  else what do you call him oh minority build a homeless uh the homeless told me so you're just  pretty much calling him because i thought it was funny oh so you only added the word spook in that  tweet and everything else was minority build the homeless yeah and what are you doing like  talking you're always in contact with some real shady characters i guess i attract shady people 
[03:00:00]  yeah and i think probably typing out what minority bill the homeless person says exactly it's not  exactly you it wouldn't hold up anywhere for you to say well no that's not my opinion that's right  homeless build a minority whatever yeah unless he's actually saying it but you're typing it yes  and bill is is homeless maybe that explains why he uh called obama that it may be what's your name 
[03:00:30]  for obama why call him negro obama oh because you don't have to have the two o's that's really  distasteful he he likes the fact that i guess yeah you could save conserve on letters yeah how come you  don't like blacks yeah what's going on i've been robbed and stabbed and beat up you were stabbed  where in the side of the face what happened the face um i just bought an ipod i'm not gonna squeal  about a few days ago before the robbery happened and i was walking home i actually worked on sixth  avenue towards the hippodrome building yeah and i'm walking to the bus to take home to where i live 
[03:01:00]  and the guy goes yo homie let me hold down your ipod i went hold on to it i like how these robberies  are like at first they will try to say something real stupid like let me hold on to that it's like  oh god here it comes he's not just gonna hold on to it just let me see it for a second yeah let me  see that oh what do you got over there is that oh no you're like oh i'm being robbed oh no you just  know what's happening so what happened well that's a good area what time was it was it late it was  late it was pretty late it was like around two three in the morning oh shit you're asking for trouble 
[03:01:30]  yeah exactly maybe he saw your organ donor thing and wanted to take your organs right there on the  spot he might have needed a liver yeah yeah maybe he followed you on twitter yeah so what happened  you said uh he said let me hold your ipod and then i said listen it's my ipod you know how you're not  taking it and then he said well then i'm gonna have to just take it from me and he had a box cutter  and the next thing i knew he just swung out his arm i pulled back he nicked my face and then i ran for  my life so he went to cut your face with a box cutter over your ipod yeah so you know what it's 
[03:02:00]  easy to call this kid a racist and stuff he's a black guy yeah so he's become racist did you dislike  honest be honest were you racist before these things happen no i've never had a problem with  anybody i've usually i was like old peas pacifist then i was robbed and beat up so many times that  it's just like i couldn't stand them anymore yeah you look at them and you have that fear like oh god  i'm gonna get killed tonight how many times have you had violent interactions with black guys  listen i could say more than 40 times really wow what do you live yeah what are you doing 
[03:02:30]  i used to live in i used to grew up i grew up in uh canarsie and i grew up in bayside queen  which is a little better but i did a lot of commuting back and forth between bad neighborhoods  you're a small guy so you look like i look like i'm easy to an easy target so they would you've  been punched for even you know i've been punched i've been bruised i've been given a concussion i've  been passed apart passed apart exactly all right wow well you know you know what i'm not going to  tell them not to be racist if i got beat up by blacks or whatever or anybody if any group beat  me up with puerto ricans i'd hate them with blacks with the jews i'd hate them if anybody beat me up 
[03:03:00]  repeatedly i wouldn't like right so that's uh where where all this comes from okay it depends on the  person hey look who might argue yeah but if you're looking at starting a career in broadcasting right  you might not put it out well you know what then he's got plenty of uh material to talk about on  it on a show about uh you know why these problems uh happen uh you know what what's wrong with these  certain communities that there just seems to be a disproportionate amount of violent behavior 
[03:03:30]  yo homie let me hold your ipod then he cuts his face from what kind of savage motherfucker cuts your  face for a fucking ipod yeah look that's fucked up right there no it is and but thank god i didn't  lose it or my life for that matter well you give up the ipod you give up the ipod and it sucks but  you know it's at that point you just fucking give up it might cut you anyway though you can never take  that chance he would have just finished the job well for him to say you know you're not taking my ipod 
[03:04:00]  that's at three in the morning why didn't you just turn and run real fast like just right away it's  like that fear over you don't know what the hell to do until your brain just starts working how  close was he to you pretty close did he step right up to you he's about maybe four or five feet from  me oh you could have fucking turn around and run was he bigger than you i was really young at that  time yeah okay scared yeah all right no not that i know of he didn't catch me i was only 14 years  old so i was fast what were you doing in the city at 14 yeah at three that morning i worked uh doing 
[03:04:30]  mortgages with my uncles doing mortgages is that code for drug dealing no that's code for mortgages  all right uh what's the next tweet next tweet oh i have to take black studies course for a  criminal justice degree thank you sean bell  so you're blaming sean bell for having to take criminal justice you have no interest basically in 
[03:05:00]  learning about black studies or black history after the the hand the experience you've had which  has been kind of victimized by a group 40 plus times i've been robbed has told me everything i  need to know about black studies have there been all mostly black guys robbing you or other groups  too 99 percent of the time it was a black guy a few times it was a hispanic gentleman and you've  actually been robbed and stuff because a few people are saying they're not buying your story  like i have the scars on my body to prove it where's the other scores people i have scars on  my chest i have scars on my legs let's see the scars on your chest i just want to see his chest little 
[03:05:30]  boy there's usually a scar like around here it's not your chest that's your hip hey nana who cut your  hip there was one on my there's one there's an appendix scar no i still have no scars there's no scars  there's no scars there's no scars there's a dent on my leg where's the scars on your chest  where's the scars on your chest are you lying no i wasn't lying it was just there's like little  scars like right there discolorations where i was hit with a pipe and all that all right listen  are you are you feeling eye patched yeah yeah totally i don't know where's the scars you said 
[03:06:00]  there were scars on your chest seriously discolorations you know maybe i can't find  it but like i said coloration who can't find a scar on their chest just said he was violently robbed 40  times if you ask anyone 18 maybe ask anyone if they have scars it's very easy boom i got one on my  thumb really bad scar on my thumb kenny are you buying this kenny uh was a professional  law enforcement that's too bad love buzz isn't here because love buzz is all over this kid's case 
[03:06:30]  yeah yeah he's he's already called him out to be a liar oh wow  derek are you lying you just don't like you guys about you don't like minorities and it's you got  to have a backstory to make it a little easier for everybody so that's just the truth 14 years old  all doing mortgages but three o'clock in the morning yeah yeah right at three in the morning  oh damn kenny's looking is there a nick on his face yeah yeah but that could be cut yourself shaving  that's a scar but where's the scar on the chest he said i have scars all over my chest i don't have 
[03:07:00]  any facial that's that's true there were no scars on the chest i'm gonna believe him  on this one i'm giving him the benefit of the doubt he has no scars on his face i don't care i  saw surveillance video this morning on the news i heard two news stories on my way in about  shootings at house parties over the weekend well two separate shootings in on long island but one in  union dale go figure there was a party going on some uninvited guests and shooting started you never hear 
[03:07:30]  that but but he's he's saying he did mortgages at three in the morning with his uncles at the age  of 14 when we ask him about that that's when i was 14 it was a very good year i did mortgages with my  uncle and got beat up like a queer explain the 14 year old doing mortgages with his uncles at three  in the morning well it was a nepotism thing my uncles used to work out in melville long island  doing a lot of mortgages they opened up a branch in midtown and i asked him for a job and he said 
[03:08:00]  yeah we'll let you have a job i was the receptionist hey ernie you got a job and the hours go all the  way to two three in the morning well like i said i had no friends growing up so it was the radio that  babysat me and my work that i was able to do but no one works at two in the morning that's the point  especially as a receptionist who i did i did a lot of the microsoft word documents a lot of the uh  the files that had to be photocopied all that oh yeah that was my thing that was how i kept  myself busy and out of trouble why were they working at that hour 40 times you didn't keep 
[03:08:30]  yourself out of trouble for trouble that was would have been 80 times so what did what why  so late though i guess i just lost track of the time you know because they had the tv there so  sometimes i would just i would just stay there because like i said i had no friends growing up  so if i needed to hang out i would hang out there in the uh little lounge they had all right show us  one scar from the 40 times you were robbed mugged and beat up one scar on my hand if you see that one  how did that happen that was when i was running and the guy nicked me that little teeny line what's 
[03:09:00]  that line that's one the guy nicked you while you were running under my chin that i had stitches for  when i fell running from another robber from another robber he's a real tough guy he just he fell  running he has no robber he has a flight or flight instinct people probably came up to him asking if he  had the time legitimately wanting the time runs into a tree i'm being robbed they had if you they  would ask you for the time and then you would reach for like a wallet or i mean not a wallet a 
[03:09:30]  cell phone or something and then they would try to rob you that way that was a big thing on sat down  back in the uh early 2000s it was like like a gang initiation of um i think the bloods oh get the  the time from a small girl well they weren't uncle pole bloods they were the uh what do you mean  the uncle pole buds what's that it was a joke i don't know i had none of the makings of a joke 
[03:10:00]  derek is a big fan he went he walked into the studio on saturday yeah before we went on the air  and he put his headphones on with the uh left headphone on and the right one off and said look  i'm wearing my headphones like jim norton oh so you know how that works that's a pretty big fan then  i do switch occasionally though just to change it up a little bit up i can't i can't have both  headphones on no steven s from bayshore says uh this guy's been robbed more times than the wine dance 
[03:10:30]  7-eleven oh damn and puddle of aids rights he's not a victim of racial crimes he's just clumsy  yeah he just falls down when was the last time you got robbed yeah last time i was robbed actually  i've been robbed in a long time i've been last time i was obviously a year ago walking home from  what happened with that one i was in bensonhurst in an italian i don't even know if you can classify  it as a robbery i was chased out of bensonhurst by a guy what were you doing in bensonhurst my  ex-girlfriend used to live in bensonhurst he was using his body to jimmy open car doors 
[03:11:00]  so you're in bensonhurst and um this i guess he was drunk this italian guy was like get the  fuck out of my neighborhood you goddamn spit get out of my neighborhood nor do you hate blacks that  i believe italian chased you out thought you were puerto rican yeah blaming on blacks  an odd boy and jordan writes oh microsoft word that's why you were there at 2 a.m and then he  just writes lol and then writes does ron afez still have the intern that lied about having a 250 
[03:11:30]  bowling average fast freddy he's ready no longer with us no longer okay but yeah i mean he didn't  he did one of his 40 robberies was a year ago where he got chased out of bensonhurst bensonhurst  because he was harassing a girl obviously yeah harassing if i was to believe your stories which  you don't i'm not really sure you put yourself in some strange situations making it easier to get  robbed it can make it easier for people to fuck with you 40 times you must be pretty happy that  it's been a year since you got robbed once oh definitely but listen when you're the size of a 
[03:12:00]  17 old anorexic girl getting robbed is like an everyday thing i'm the same size as you oh you're  not you're not how many times you've been robbed zero well because you're black you are black yeah i can  say i've been robbed zero times as well yeah travis and i've walked at 3 30 in the morning in new  york for the last five years you just jinxed yourself no kidding yeah no trust me i i think  about how do you how do you prevent uh how do you stay safe to have you done things where you thought 
[03:12:30]  like this is a bad situation maybe i should step aside you're always at that time you're always  very aware hyper alert of your surroundings yeah absolutely trust me i've had people come up to me  and ask you know oh you want this you want girls you want yeah and no you just keep walking you i've  had that too multiple times been asked for the time do i want to see some girls do i want coke  lots of stuff you just wave your head no no no and keep walking why i don't even acknowledge you're a 
[03:13:00]  kid enjoy all those things i don't think that they would actually surprise me you're a kid  girls you're getting robbed do you think i think i might they might just take my money and then  cause physical harm that time thing is the best fucking thing because first of all why does  anyone want to know the time at three in the morning on the street it's like you're you're  so up to no good i'm gonna you're gonna distract me i'm gonna look at my watch or pull out an iphone  and check the time that way when there's three of you and all three of you combined can't figure it

[03:14:00]  up you did the sean bell so uh the next one yeah okay um this one says been listening to 20 on 20  and old nation lately i've just lost my testicles but i'll never be ghetto and go to shade 45 or hip  not hip-hop nation ah don't like that hip-hop stuff huh not at all why don't you like the hip-hop  because if you take the lyrics out of hip-hop it's that same three beats over and over again it's not  creative with a rock band if you take out the lyrics you still have the creativity of the drums 
[03:14:30]  the bass the guitar the rhythm guitar what's your favorite band my favorite band on saturday he his  two favorite bands he said i believe were led zeppelin and dragon force no led zeppelin wasn't a favorite  band but what's dragon dragon force and led zeppelin were the two that dragon force put on par with  each other you know the mope i don't know they don't clue they're a power metal band okay really fast  there's dragon force drivers obviously all right put your headphones on for this young lady 
[03:15:00]  dragon force by the way you know them they play uh they do the last song in guitar hero that's like  ridiculously impossible okay oh i i thought i knew the name okay all right yeah this was the one that's  like you can't play you can't play this is this the uh so they're actually good musicians  what about that ejaculatory shredding 
[03:15:30]  that's hard to do i guess  sounds like a fucking rio speedwagon theme song to rocky 16  well actually the lyricist uh he's not in the band anymore  oh it kicked out bad though that's all right yeah i wouldn't i wouldn't love it but it's not  terrible uh dave c wants to know if you've ever filed a police report derek  never in the 40 times when i was really younger my dad is a um he's in law enforcement and he made 
[03:16:00]  me file a police report actually so be a yes that would be a yes when was the first time you were  robbed in junior high school i was 13 so between the ages of 13 and 18 17 it's been a year 17 so  between the ages of 13 and 17 which is four years you were robbed 40 times 10 times a year that's once  every month and a month and a half every five weeks you were robbed every five weeks for five 
[03:16:30]  weeks i was robbed a lot  i would prefer to actually be lying but you know what it's sometimes you just got to go through it  it's like a growing up thing yeah i can't decide if he's lying or not the scars on the chest kind  of got to me because there was none you had a pristine apple-y boyish chest the mortgage thing's  weird to it three in the morning mortgage exactly no one's awake to get mortgages so he landed on  marvin gardens and he sold it yeah wow how much stuff have you lost in 40 robberies 
[03:17:00]  lots of money money and a lot of wallets what's the most money you lost  in one robbery that may be 120 that's a lie why would you give up 120 but you wouldn't give up an  ipod because my ipod was like three four hundred dollars and i love music so i wasn't giving up an  ipod that i busted my ass for where were you when you got robbed for the ipod right by the library  on 42nd street didn't he wait no he was right what avenue fifth fifth avenue you were fifth avenue

[03:19:30]  a certain segment of the black population why do you hate obama why do you hate obama  i'm certain a black dude who looked like obama never robbed you we're trying to get  headphones on yeah why do you hate obama who wants to know he understands why you  just because he's black but not obama no not at all because he's black i don't even matter that  he might even be born in america the fact that bothers me is his um the blame wall street thing that  bothers me how he wants to demonize wall street what about the cute little nickname you have for  obama that has nothing to do with being black negro obama is that what you call them yeah that's 
[03:20:00]  correct well that does have to do with him being black but i mean my prejudice with him has nothing  to do with him being black it's just the name is just poking fun at him for being black okay that  makes any sense oh no it has nothing to do with him being black it's poking fun at him for being black  right that makes perfect sense coop your phone is very bad today yeah coop we're gonna have to bail  on you i'm sorry if you're still listening coop we pay that bill call back if you get a better  connection because you were we were shaking we couldn't understand what you're saying another  phone card one um one in one uh one beastie 333 tweeted something very funny he said was this

[03:21:00]  and the bloods were killing two or three people a night and i delivered in the heart of those areas  at the time i was a scrawny little white guy and i'd be wandering around with a couple hundred bucks  in my pocket from delivery and i never got robbed once yeah the pizza delivery guy would be a very easy  target in a bad neighborhood lots of cash i mean i was i was going into the projects in project areas  in denver where the cops would come up and go man you have no business being in this part of town 
[03:21:30]  and i never once got fucking robbed so i i mean i realize new york city is a little bit different  but i am so calling bravo zero in this kid's story yeah a lot of people are a lot of people are  they're not buying them you're not selling this uh you're not selling this good enough to the peeps  yeah but like he might not have been robbed but you know what he may have been lucky you said uh  you said chest scars assuming we wouldn't ask to see him and then you lifted your shirt up assume  that you wouldn't ask to see them but there are no chest but there are no chest scars not a one 
[03:22:00]  how'd you get the dent in your leg and where's the dent on i wasn't getting hit hit with what  some baseball bat or something like that i thought you said a pipe before he said i don't need a  baseball bat or something i don't even know it's a small event right there why did they hit you with  a pipe bat with your hand it's very small you can see it's right there it's black it's a little bump  on the shin i don't quite see it why are those from climbing ladders in my air conditioning career  and like just a little yeah here's the issues we're having you did say you were robbed on sixth 
[03:22:30]  avenue and then you changed it to fifth and 43rd which i tripped you up brilliantly with my  interrogation yes and then you did say your chest scars and we didn't see any so it's kind of a tough  sell and then you said i think you said you were hit with a pipe in the leg and then it turned into a  baseball bat or something you'll have to remember that i'm on the i'm on air with opie and anthony and  jim norton and where were you hit with a pipe in my left leg this guy's where else were you hit  with a pipe this guy's a smooth one i was hit here now he's back for the pipe again in my shoulder

[03:23:30]  probably better qualified than we are at least toss in some questions i get them in private  i teach him a lesson no you don't have to beat him up you have to like yeah tune him up what do you got  on this kid kenny what do you got we don't want you to beat him up but you've been listening to  him for about half hour what do you got on him no i if i could get him what's his profile  and and and like really look at him while i'm talking let's do it right now yeah why don't you  guys sit on the sofa you might not be able to do it as effectively but i would just like to see how  it's done it would be boring for radio so what that never stopped us before yeah you're acting like 
[03:24:00]  we think about that on a daily basis all right the next week because i don't know what's going on  with kenny the next tweet come on derrick help us out we'll come on my little sweetie  great special delivery tonight black people please don't crash next saturday i don't want  traffic just drive normally please so black people drive bed a lot of people would say the asians drive  bed uh-huh do blacks uh drive bed in uh yeah i've noticed uh driving your experience um 
[03:24:30]  um stereotypically and from what i've seen uh asians are by far some of the worst drivers on the road  especially in those vans delivery vans that are covered in asian graffiti if you're coming up on  one of those in the left lane forget just get the fuck out of the way right to the right uh yeah it's  really bad uh you have to go to the right lane yeah exactly um dude there's black women black women  yes are very very bad drivers um and the bigger they are the worse they are at driving uh i will 
[03:25:00]  also and this isn't to be pc young white girls on the fucking cell phone disgusting are the most  dangerous fucking things to try to get around because you never know when they're just going to  cut right into your fucking lane and they're constantly on the phone in that car i'll look  over and see a car weaving and i'm like i this has to be a dopey white broad trying to fucking text 
[03:25:30]  uh but it's very very close between asian women asian men too asian women and asian men not much  of a difference true between their their shitty driving but black women just bad drivers indians  not good either yeah yeah yeah not at all good well most of their experience i get from them are in cabs  or the town cars which i swear to god i want to just run right into dude i hate do you have to  make a duty no no my legs are like fucking you're stretching anthony never stands up i was in the 
[03:26:00]  pool all weekend and so you got a little cramping going a little like like i i was uh yeah what is  in the calf that calf you want to rub your leg no no back of my thighs i'll rub that asian asian man  by the way in a minivan could be the worst yeah yeah minivan asian guy i had one of those just  the other day just amazing uh a couple calls that have to be taken yes uh where where where was the 
[03:26:30]  bus round again i forgot fifth avenue fifth avenue at what time three in the morning give or take a  few minutes all right you're taking a bus on fifth avenue three in the morning okay got it uh marty  what's going on yeah how you doing guys hey i just wanted to point out that uh i believe he's he's  referring uh derek's referring to the express buses going to patten island hold on hold on hold on  let's ask derek is that the bus he's uh he's talking about yes okay yes marty as far as i know though  the last bus leaves manhattan at midnight and doesn't start running again until the morning 
[03:27:00]  no the last bus leaves staten island at midnight he's got an answer for everything no i know new york  city transit like the back of my hand marty he's telling you that you're wrong  i i don't know which which route was he referring to exact route number oh good point the x10 the  madison avenue route not the the only the only the only express bus that runs even till midnight is  the x1 and the x1 comes off of staten island oh shit at 12 and i don't know if this is 100 correct 
[03:27:30]  but the last bus off of staten island is 12 43 that is the last bus that you get right by the verrazano  bridge right by father capadonna what's up with this kid he was really right this is a really  weird one so there's nothing running at 3 a.m no no that's going to that's only going to manhattan  it's not coming back from manhattan to staten island i could see it being later going from  manhattan and from staten island i have to say derek i think might be right something's really 
[03:28:00]  strange here this is this is strange yeah mars what do you think mars strange he's a strange one  right he's got an answer for everything yeah i think he's got a lot of the answers are logical  you give me a lot of answers you're not giving me the right answer i think his issue is that he's  a portrayed a hispanic and he runs across problems like that and he's supposed to act the role like  maybe people step to him instead of being maltese yeah and like you know i take offense of being uh  i take offense of being called hispanic actually i don't blame you tell him that's that's some racist 
[03:28:30]  shit yes it is to be offended when somebody says you are you hispanic is yeah why would you be  offended because a lot of times in school i've been uh oh boy been racially targeted like that  people would say my last name rodriguez and i don't like that because that's really like  insinuating like i'm a hardcore puerto rican when i'm have no spanish in me whatsoever wait but your  last name is rodriguez yeah but it's spelled with an s at the end instead yeah but that's like  how the fuck does that mean with the z is the spanish well no hey look uh puerto ricans get mad if you  call them dominicans dominicans get so like that a lot of people don't like being called something 
[03:29:00]  else so that's not racist that's just you know you're sick and tired of being confused with  somebody who you're not let me talk to derek for a second are you uh sit on my lap are you uh no  no no no no no no no no okay like i said my dad's in law enforcement i'd be have a bullet in my head  before i did something what's he do he's a correction officer okay all right let me say hi to peter  in massachusetts peter yeah i got a question uh is spookville next to fantasy land 
[03:29:30]  thank you sir and we got uh we got a bus driver on the line pat in staten island he bribes a dust  hi pat uh that guy on the phone's wrong that 10x does run until about three in the morning so  all right he's got that's why this kid's a strange one man i believe him on the facts you  believe him on that one yes because he doesn't drive i bet and he takes it from you drive no  i do drive now i just take the bus a lot yeah he grew up in the city man he takes a tremendous 
[03:30:00]  amount of mass transit probably and i don't know if you know this but mars is you know he's a pr  no i have no problem i have no problem people like people of that race say it with them i have  no problem with those those people you sure with those interlopers listen i have friends that are  african-american i just have  that are african-american you don't say you can say black i have yeah i have black 
[03:30:30]  guys i know some black guys black yeah black african-american is such an inaccurate to see  it's it's just not a fucking well i don't want to say something i'm gonna have you guys like get  in trouble because that would what after these tweets yeah a couple you're gonna say a couple  of these are gonna make me not sleep tonight uh the next tweet there derek oh wait the schedule  for the x10 bus says it stops leaving manhattan at 115 according to sam roberts but then we had 
[03:31:00]  the bus driver on the line yeah i don't know was that a bus driver or was it a guy just  fucking around or one of derek's friends now i'm very confused what are you saying derek well  that may have actually changed due to like the budget stuff but i know that it didn't  oh oh the budget got an answer that's why it's a fucking but that wasn't an answer that was just like  an educated guess all right i think i'll give him the benefit of the doubt with the with the bus  schedules all right uh the next uh tweet there derek stuck in traffic on the southern state  because a blackie had a crash into the pole fuck how did you know what race the person was exactly 
[03:31:30]  because when you drove by was it a caddy when you drove by you saw the kid standing there oh okay  oh wait these are going backwards so you're so this was the car crash that had you in traffic so that's  why the the special delivery tweet after this yes or before this i was heading to special delivery oh  we should have read them the other way then but that's fine okay staten island though i mean uh southern  state  wow long island so what were you doing on long island i have family out long island most of my 
[03:32:00]  family they live in massapeague or franklin square get robbed not out there exactly do you get shot  stabbed and hit in the head with a no it's actually uh are you reginald denny i have no idea okay  get hit with a toilet well the next one is a very interesting tweet anthony go ahead derek do i need  to self-center this one oh you wrote it all right well this one is uh can't wait i'm a punch  my nigger supervisor out i'm gonna call the clam we going in white people style cocksucker i got  outlaw country on white people style listen you can be racist if you want but i have i have bad 
[03:32:30]  news for you about the clan  somebody's really not gonna welcome you with open arms they're a little picky your mediterraneans are  not you're not in their top five hit list no you're still considered a mongrel of some sort  to the they don't like you're definitely a problem they don't like me they're my irish don't feel bad  they hate anthony as much as he loves them they don't they reject him and his italian  you know something that wasn't like a glorification of the clan that was more of just like a 
[03:33:00]  a really sick and twisted joke let me say we're going in white people style but clan the clan  those are like judo those are like real white people they're like they're wasps yeah yeah i hate  to break it to you but you're like the club you want to get into but you can't yeah you know yeah  they don't welcome they don't welcome twink mediterranean boys it's not there you'd have a  hard time getting the clan yeah yeah trying to convince them that the z and the s at the end of 
[03:33:30]  your name is yeah making it different you should be allowed in as they're fucking too dark for them  as they're stringing you up to a tree all they would say no matter what your reasoning was is go  ahead talk some puerto rican talk yeah that's all they'd say is you were trying to explain  here's a good test go there and eyeball one of their white women yeah anybody from shade 45  want to come across the hall i was suggesting stanley let me tell you who's a fucking problem  stanley t is a stanley t from philly is a problem stanley t is an absolute problem with jimmy he's on 
[03:34:00]  this faggy show right now but this kid is uh hardcore philly man yes philly black guys are  fucking crazy stanley t is a fucking problem and that's good i completely agree with you smiles a lot  around here but man he's a nice guy oh yeah that's good because the next tweet uh i think  he'd like to hear um oh yeah we're gonna make you we should wait yeah we're gonna wait yeah you're  gonna say the next week to stanley t kenny how old is stanley t would you say he's not like a 20 
[03:34:30]  year old guy he's been around for a while remember derek you said no filter you said it not us you're  a no filter type of guy so we're gonna bring in a black guy from philly who's on the morning mashup stanley  t and you're gonna read the next tweet to him how old do you think he is ken like 35 yeah he's probably  early 30s yeah he used to have a tv show down there those fucking i'm telling you philly black  guys man do not play fucking games no no and they're all you would you would like a lot of  them are very unassuming looking guys like keith robinson doesn't look like he would fucking fight 
[03:35:00]  six cops he just doesn't stanley t looks like the nicest guy yeah uh here comes stanley t last week  when rampage was here they they interviewed him on the mashup yeah and stanley t was arguing with rich  davis because stanley said like you know he would fight him if he you know he wasn't afraid i think  he would fight him all the rampage would kill him yeah but here comes stanley t get that mic up nice  and high for stanley t very big stanley t all right listen come over here let me explain 
[03:35:30]  first of all me and jimmy are on the same page we know you're on kind of a like a faggy show right now  but it's working for you and it's paying the bills but you're like you're a hardcore philly guy right  yes yes i am like you've done the other type of radio and you've gotten into some shit right yeah  yeah of course of course actually the truth of the matter is i'm originally from brooklyn  but i adopted philly as my city because i had such a strong showing when it was back in the 90s i was  pretty big there right so what did i walk into what are you guys saying all right this guy is uh derek 
[03:36:00]  he's one of our interns and he's a big uh tweet guy and he also told us remember sam he did tell us  that he's no filter you're a no filter type of guy filter so we've been reading his tweets that are a little  dangerous staley his tweets have been uh on the a little on the racist side they're racially  insensitive and he says this is because he has this image of black guys because he's been robbed  40 times and 99.9 of it has been by black guys right and he has a couple of words why are you laughing  it's fucking hysterical yeah so you've been robbed 40 times by black guys and you have a problem 
[03:36:30]  yeah for four years for four years four years okay well let me tell you what your problem is  do again right now let me tell you what his problem is it's nothing to do with color  it's nothing to do with black it's just your look you look afraid so anybody anybody will mess with  you whether it be puerto rican jew you might go into some uh areas in brooklyn and hasidic jews  might kick your ass for real for real so you kind of look afraid uh thugs sense that they sense that 
[03:37:00]  fear have you walking around oh my god it's five black guys on this train you're gonna get your  ass kicked that's how it is but the other thing stanley t we're not really sure if we're buying it at  all we don't know we're telling the truth or not i'm not saying he's lying because we're not really  sure we're trying to figure it out we've been trying to figure it out for about 45 minutes but uh  once you read the next tweet right to stand because you did say no no no filter no filter  okay go ahead there it goes all right you might hear this is gonna upset me you probably not  you might hear something a little outrageous all right all right you might like this and you never 
[03:37:30]  know all right i would home from the ghetto need to get the smell of fried chicken and watermelon out  of my nose the fuck is this guy right yeah and you're wondering why you get your ass kicked  no this is i would kick your ass now just say oh shit no no no now see why would you why would  you stereotype things like that why would you say something why would you tweet that because he got robbed  40 times he said he's telling us he wasn't like this until he got robbed all right first of all  he hates i can't stand watermelon i'm guilty on the chicken thing i always say that i am very guilty 
[03:38:00]  but i don't i don't freaking like watermelon listen man what you spew out there is gonna come back to  you all hell well seriously have you read my tweets i know they're probably wimpy tweets i always put  out these positive tweets because the shit comes back to you like like jim spiration remember all that  shit p diddy was doing back in the day boy did he get the bullets back right all the  shit that he popped in in his wraps biggie you know did they get that shit back or what for real  for real so it's it's karma in the universe man you put that negative stuff out there it's gonna 
[03:38:30]  flow back to you brother it is it's like i always say if i throw out positivity negativity follows it  quickly god damn it that is awesome ladies and gentlemen jim spiration jim spiration i like that yeah  yeah no they're great so now you get i don't understand why you we don't know if we believe  that you've been robbed that's yeah yeah if he's been robbed 40 times by one group well i wouldn't  like that group either but i don't know if we buy that he's been robbed that many times where did 
[03:39:00]  these robbings take place they've taken place in manhattan brooklyn and queens i've never really  i'm in hat i said manhattan right yeah yeah that's great or the bronx i've never actually been to the  bronx okay because you have a fear of do you have do you have a fear of black people yeah i guess  you could yeah yeah when i see a black when i see a black person with his pants down here i try to  tend to cross the street or try to just put my head down so you just have a fear of black people  if i get real close to you like this yeah now that you just pull them real close what's up with that 
[03:39:30]  as soon as i grab him pull it real close i feel like after your motherfucking pockets you just want  to rob them right you want to rob come on man listen this is what you do he really could manhandle  all you got to do is you first of all you need some shades so they can't see the fear in your  eyes get some really dark ones so they can't see what you're looking at okay and you'll walk through  anywhere nobody will bother you man but if you have fear on your face like back in the day i used to go  to george westinghouse high school which is in brooklyn it's the same high school that biggie used to go  and i used to rob people man it's not something i'm proud about but we used to do that we used to jack 
[03:40:00]  chains and stuff like that but we would always operate on fear yo yo yo look at that sucker right  there yeah let's get them and it's hard to rob 30 year olds  they hit back you never know have you been robbed silly yeah yeah i was in i was robbed in brooklyn  took took one of my favorite gold chains a guy around the neighborhood and then i used to have to see  this cat every day so we had to get along back in the day you know if you get beat down in your  neighborhood you got to make a stand man because you're going to get your ass kicked every single 
[03:40:30]  day so i actually had to have it out with this guy i lost the fight but he knew he was in a fight  so he never messed with me again did he get back your chain no i never got back my chain it was  how did he rob you was it but with his hands or did he put a gun on nah nah he like walked up to me  had two of his boys with me he just grabbed it and took it and i knew i was with another cat that  wasn't going to fight and i knew that there's nothing i could do if i fight with him i was  gonna get beat down so i just had to take it i didn't like it but i just you fought him after 
[03:41:00]  that yeah i had to fight him after because he started messing with me all the time i said oh  man i'm gonna have to get down with this guy and you lost i lost i lost and the guy was shorter than  me too he knew karate and all this stuff he fucked me up pretty bad but i did get a hold of him and i  did so he knew he was in a fight and he never bothered me he didn't bother you anymore never  bothered me again did you know the real did you know the original uh how old the guy are you if you  don't you're not like saying your age yeah it's a big secret i never say all right i'm gonna guess  uh you're at least my maybe night at my age you're probably a little younger than me okay did you  know 50 cent the original uh 50 cent no no before the rap no no i didn't the real guy okay no no i 
[03:41:30]  think he was from brooklyn around me okay all right uh derek why don't you read the final tweak  because then stanley's got to go to his uh radio show yeah that's pretty good the morning man  oh my goodness the chicken and watermelon what's the next one on to the final so i could see all the  stone spooks one last time till september why the voice is cracking did anyone else  yeah yeah i'm not saying it's loud he's not as open or proud of his teeth so wait a minute  so you're getting your ass kicked by blacks but you're calling them spoofs uh water melon eating 
[03:42:00]  chicken eating and if you were here earlier you would have down if you were here earlier you would  have seen niglet after yeah that was he said niglet what yeah you want to know all the ones he said  stanley yes i see i see you sweating you want to hit this kid so bad i'm trying to no i don't  i'm trying to figure your mouth spookville um anthony he sounds like your tweets so i know  something you would say anthony's his hero i know no he said that and then he said obama 
[03:42:30]  and uh he's red he's embarrassed that he said that and he calls him negro obama negro obama yeah  that's actually funny uh let's see i have to take black studies course for criminal justice degree  thanks to sean bell uh yeah i i don't know what that's about dude for real and again spookville  are you a little embarrassed that stanley was a he's red he's really red you know what i'd like  to do i like to take him to bedside like leave him there like two in the morning oh yeah see you 
[03:43:00]  later what bus gets you home from there slick yeah the coroner's truck yeah or you like to get beat up  maybe you like getting beat down no no you just say things and think that you're going to get  positiveness from say spew notes like that i haven't robbed in a year oh this is like a culmination of  being robbed and being tortured and being picked on and being the little guy never picked in gym and all  that crap oh it's a little more than just i never got picked in gym why you didn't why because his 
[03:43:30]  fucking feet are like a t-square maybe you should get orthotics he never got picked uh you got picked  on oh boy used to be called juma goo why because i'm jewish so they called me juma go you're jewish  too mediterranean jewish and you like the clan i changed my earlier statement you are in the top  five hit list yeah the clan hates jews more than anything on the planet except maybe do they hate 
[03:44:00]  gays or jews more no jews jews they consider the devil well wait a minute blacks are second  on that oh believe me blacks are second yeah yeah yeah black or second gays they are not fond of  homosexuals no no but but black really they go racially before sex i'm pretty sure i think but  jews are number one because they literally think jews are satan they think they are the spawn of  of of the devil himself and blacks they just you know actually they're not even like they just 
[03:44:30]  want like separatism they want blacks to go back to africa and uh you know them the white  fucking people will rule over here and shit like that but uh gays yeah i know they don't like the  gays they're either second or a close third i can't believe blacks would be third though on the  clan's list i can i'm thinking about something you ever date you ever date a black girl maybe some of  the guys hate you because you dated one of their girls or something never never you ever date a  girl i mean i've dated a girl not a black one okay he said he said he's single would he date a black 
[03:45:00]  girl he's not that desperate yet oh you just oh you got it you just got to ask what we're coming  you just wouldn't ask you're not allowed to bring one home you're not allowed to bring one home if i  bring a black woman home i'm disowned from the family oh awesome this is all right are you scared of  stanley no he seems like a cool guy i mean i thought if i met him on the street i'd probably  cross the street i wanted the nicest guy to give me that i just have one rule just don't touch me  don't threaten me don't touch me you know who threatened me the fucking uh ramp rampage 
[03:45:30]  yeah he gave me the ultimate fighter stare down in the studio and i'm from brooklyn i don't go for  that i realized that he could probably whip my ass but like i said before you're going to know you were  in a fight you touch me you're going to know you're in the was he staring down because rampage will do  that like because it's part of his shtick like he's joking he's joking around when he does that  okay he gets people's faces but he's just he gives a great stare yeah sometimes you don't know  that's the problem you don't know if it's fake i know while we were doing i said whoa you trying 
[03:46:00]  to stare me down yeah you trying to stare me down right he says i'm from memphis let's go i'm from  brooklyn memphis will go down you know what i mean and of course you were telling me these guys break  arms they bite did you see even though liddell lost the fight liddell broke the guy's arm with a kick  rampage lost his last fight but he's a tough fucking dude man oh yeah rampage is a very tough  guy wow hey uh derek um you know you mentioned you wouldn't be able to go home to your family  uh were you raised in a kind of a racist environment uh your family do you hear a lot of racist words 
[03:46:30]  and ideology my dad was a correction officer so he's not too fond on oh really on what on what he's not  too fond of blacks yeah he's not too fond of spanish people really but listen he has his  reasons he has to deal with a lot of very bad people every day of his life he deals with the  worst elements of every group exactly so he sees the worst element that it's all he knows but i used  to never agree with him on what he said and now i kind of agree with him and now you do wow i think  he's had some bad experience i think you're right because he does not no offense but he looks like a 
[03:47:00]  victim in in the uh and i do too i just know where to go believe me i have i don't think i'm a tough guy  either i'm just you you have that you have that crazy stare look in your eye i don't know what i  blink a lot maybe that helps yeah yeah and i say mister a lot when they ask me a question i really  no thank you mister and people don't bother you they think you're retarded yeah they think  they think you'll bite them nobody wants to be bitten you still at carolines by the way jim  no no it's just that one fucking weekend okay one weekend i'll be back in january all right  well all right well let's get stanley t out of here thank you very much much love thank you
