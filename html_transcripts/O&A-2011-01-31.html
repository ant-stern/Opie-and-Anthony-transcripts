<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of the unfolding political situation in Egypt. Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton debated the protests, Mubarak's potential ouster, the Muslim Brotherhood's possible rise to power, and the revolution's role of social media.  Their commentary included darkly comedic reactions to videos and images from the protests, along with humorous jabs at news anchors and their coverage of the events.  The conversation also veered into a discussion about the geopolitical implications for Israel and the United States, sparked by a call from David in Israel who highlighted the high cost of gas there compared to the US.  This led to a tangential discussion about the perceived poor quality of Jewish food and more jokes about staff member Eric Nagel.  Opie recounted an angry encounter with a New York City truck driver, adding to the show's comedic tone.  The hosts teased the upcoming in-studio appearance of powerlifter Poundstone Power and a "surprise" involving Sam's mother, the latter of which was deferred until after a commercial break. Studio guest Rich Voss joined the discussion towards the end, offering his perspective on the Egyptian crisis.

Following the commercial break, the show shifted to a debate about the US's role in Egyptian politics during the uprising.  One host vehemently argued against US intervention, using profane language to express his belief that the US should prioritize its own interests and avoid meddling in Egypt's internal affairs unless directly impacted, such as control of the Suez Canal. The other host countered that the US's geopolitical position and reliance on the region's oil necessitated some level of involvement to maintain strategic alliances and prevent hostile powers from gaining influence.  The discussion employed crude comparisons to the game Risk and featured profane remarks about various countries and their governments. The potential threat of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons was also discussed, with differing opinions on whether that warranted US intervention.  No guests were present during this segment.

[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  I would love to say we have the best job in America. 
[00:03:30]  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  It could be the best thing ever.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  Out loud laughs.  How do we explain the show?  We should start there.  Oh, here it is.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show, a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, shit.  This is a freak show.  Why would anybody want to come on this show as a guest?  Under the right circumstances, something weird could happen. 
[00:04:00]  I don't give a fuck.  Laugh out loud funny.  Which I love.  That's what I love.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  Because when you listen to our show, because when you listen to our show, you know what you get.  You know what we are.  Everything has to do with cock or balls.  You know, the jokes all end up talking about cock and balls.  You're a waste of life.  Fucking listeners, go fucking die.  Excuse me.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people.  Real excitement. 
[00:04:30]  Wow.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palama.  Let's get the show on the road.  And we're off.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  A brand new week.  Oh, my God.  For all of us.  Brand new.  You had to remind me.  Starting right up.  You had to remind me.  Yeah.  It's Monday, right?  Monday.  What excuse can we come up with this week to work four days?  More snow. 
[00:05:00]  More snow tomorrow.  Snow day.  I don't know.  Thumbs up.  Thumbs up for snow.  What time is that supposed to start?  Tomorrow morning, I think.  Now they're saying tonight?  They moved it to tonight?  All right.  And then it's going to snow until like Wednesday or something like that.  Should I stay in?  Yeah, you don't want to deal with that.  You might as well.  The bad thing about me staying in, although it is Monday, and believe it or not, I do kind  of have a gauge.  The bad thing about staying in, though, is I stay in and think, okay, now I don't have 
[00:05:30]  to drive in, so I can stay up and out later.  So I wind up staying up.  And it's the city, so, you know, there's plenty to do.  And then I wind up fucking, it would have been better if I had to drive in on Tuesday morning.  But I might stay in.  We'll see.  You might have to stay in tomorrow night.  I think that's why it's really bad.  Yeah.  It's the morning commute that's the bitch.  Afternoon, not so bad, even if it is snowing.  Like, there's not that many people.  But mornings are just...  I got in a fucking yelling match this morning. 
[00:06:00]  I was pulling up 47th, right before Park Avenue.  And that's a light you gotta make.  You don't make that light, you tack another five minutes onto your ride in.  Doesn't sound like much, but we work by the minute here.  And there's a cab, and he ain't moving.  And there's a truck in front of him.  And there's a fuckload of space between the cab and the truck.  And the truck's got his hazard lights on.  And the cab can't figure it out.  He can't squeeze through.  Well, I fucking zip around the cab like, fuck you.  I'll squeeze through.  I've been driving in the city long enough to know cabs stink when it comes to driving. 
[00:06:30]  And they're paying attention.  They're paperwork.  They're dome lights on.  They're fucking stopped at green lights.  So I go around them, and now I'm waiting for the truck to do something.  I'm waiting for the light to turn.  Now the guy in the truck gets out, and he comes over to my vehicle.  He goes, you don't think the cab was smart enough to know what was going on?  I was just like, what?  He goes, I'm parking. 
[00:07:00]  This tractor-trailer is now going to parallel park on 47th.  Holy shit.  So he must have let the cab know before I got there that he was going to do that.  So the cab was way backed off.  I see a cab backed off or something.  And I instantly, I don't think that the cab is being courteous to anybody.  I think he's fucking up.  But the tractor-trailer, it's going to take him 30 seconds to parallel park.  Oh, yeah.  It's just the tractor-trailer in the snow.  Why would the tractor-trailer do the right thing and let you pass?  Just let me go. 
[00:07:30]  Where are you going?  I got somewhere to go.  And there's no one else.  It's me and the cab and the tractor-trailer.  So yeah, let me buy.  Common courtesy, let the guy buy.  But when he asked me, he goes, he goes, you don't think the cab knew what was going on  when he was behind me and backed off?  I go, no.  I didn't think the cab knew what was going on.  And I go, if you drive in the city enough, you know the cabs don't know shit.  I'm supposed to base what I do on what cabs are doing?  Fuck that.  Then he walked back to his truck, and right when he shut the door, I blurted out the 
[00:08:00]  appropriate racial epithet for him and had to sit there and wait for him to...  Parallel park.  You had to wait.  That's why I can't.  I got in fucking, you know, five to eight minutes late.  That fucking sucks.  Important eight minutes.  Why couldn't he...  Oh, you couldn't get by him.  No, I couldn't get by him.  You tried that.  What about the sidewalk?  Oh, the snow.  I mentioned it.  There was no snow in the garbage.  There was enough sidewalk and just low enough snow for me to get on the sidewalk, but the 
[00:08:30]  truck was blocking my view as to if I could have gotten off the sidewalk.  So I couldn't make that move.  Because I said, I went, oh, if that opening, if there was an opening in front of him on the  sidewalk, I wouldn't have even been, I wouldn't have had a conversation with the guy.  And the garbage piles don't help.  Yeah, the garbage is piling up now.  Let me tell you how fucked up this city is.  First of all, we have, what, 36 inches more snow than we usually have for an entire winter  already.  And it's not even February.  And New York gets snow into March. 
[00:09:00]  Sometimes early April, you get that one last blast, right?  Yep.  So what happens, every time it snows, they blow off garbage pickup.  I didn't know this.  Because it's the same guys.  Can't pick it up.  We pay our taxes out the fucking ass.  And they're on a shoestring budget.  It's like, okay, if it snows, blow off the garbage.  Okay, it's not snowing, pick up the garbage.  Oh, it's snowing again, blow off the garbage.  There is so much garbage out there right now.  Have you seen the piles?  Oh, yeah.  And if this snowstorm hits tonight before they can pick up this garbage, it's going 
[00:09:30]  to get insane later on this week.  Yeah.  They can't do anything with it.  But that's bullshit.  We pay our shit.  Yeah.  Why can't they figure out where the money goes and make sure the garbage is off the street?  Sam said on the way into work today, he saw rats actually climbing over piles of snow.  That's adorable.  And the weird thing is, like I think you said a couple weeks ago, I said, you know, with  the garbage, you're going to see rats.  And you're like, ah, it's too cold.  It's too tempting for the rats.  There is so much fucking garbage out there.  If you're a rat, you're like, you know what? 
[00:10:00]  I know it's cold, but I'm going to go take a peek.  It's like a buffet.  It's a little chilly out, but it's like this is the best buffet ever.  It's like, fuck it.  Let's go for it.  So Sam saw two rats today just climbing over piles.  Oh, we're looking at fucking one inch.  Maybe they adjusted it.  I don't know.  Like my old neck of the woods, Buffalo and Rochester is going to get two feet of snow.  Oh, no.  Yeah, yeah.  Places just even north and west of us are going to get blasted.  You're saying another five to eight for us.  I just saw a dusting to an inch.  Really?  Then maybe they adjusted it. 
[00:10:30]  So maybe they could pick up our fucking garbage.  They love talking like it's going to be big right up until zero hour.  You know what they were doing?  They weren't.  I don't think they wanted to panic anybody on the news because they weren't calling it  a storm this morning.  They were calling it a snow event.  Event, right.  They would call it a storm.  Really?  If it was going to be a storm, they would call it a fucking storm.  Oh, really?  So it's a snow event.  If you want to talk about an event, let's talk about Egypt, you assholes.  Now that's an event.  I actually was watching the coverage yesterday and they said from just complete chaos, the  country is like completely not falling apart. 
[00:11:00]  It's changing.  Pandemonium.  We'll see what it changes into.  It's not falling apart, that's for sure.  But it's a fucking, it's chaos.  I'm voting for Muslim Brotherhood.  Yeah.  I want Muslim Brotherhood in there.  Where do we get our Muslim Brotherhood t-shirts?  Muslim Brotherhood.  I want to be the first one in New York that has a Muslim Brotherhood t-shirt.  That sounds badass.  I want Team Muslim Brotherhood.  How do I make a gang sign, MB?  Fuck.  That's good.  Yeah, yo.  But I tweeted this too.  I was watching MSNBC's coverage and there's a bubble-headed bleach blonde that obviously 
[00:11:30]  had very curly hair like Farrah Fawcett hair.  So you know she was using a curling iron before she went to work to talk about what's going  on in Egypt.  She's all gussied up?  She's all gussied up and I'm like, I can't watch some woman that's all gussied up talking  about what's happening in Egypt.  Nah, you need a man.  Then I moved over to CNN.  You need a man.  You need a man.  You need a man that's not quaffing too much.  Yeah, I was watching Fox News' coverage because they blame it all on Obama.  Of course.  And I could sit there and go, yes! 
[00:12:00]  How did they turn it into Obama's problem?  It was very hard to do.  It went through somewhere in Indonesia.  But they were able to do it?  It was something about a second cousin that knew a friend in the Sudan.  They made the connection?  They made the connection somehow.  Yeah, Glenn Beck used his chalkboard and made that connection.  Fuck Glenn Beck.  That's one guy.  Fuck him.  He's a fucking mental patient.  He sure is.  Anyway, so they go from the Egypt thing to this storm that's going to hit the Northeast.  And said, it's going to be testing our nerves, another snowstorm in the Northeast. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, really?  And I'm thinking, how could you say from Egypt to another snowstorm in the Northeast, testing our nerves?  Our nerves.  I think we could take a little snowfall.  How about Molotov cocktails raining down on you?  It's a little different.  I'd rather take snowflakes than rocks being thrown at my head.  Rocks.  Fucking assholes.  They love their rocks over there.  Fuck, man.  They love throwing their rocks at armored vehicles.  How do we get in on that fucking IPO?  It's crazy.  The rock IPO.  They just fucking pick up rocks and throw it at people that are shooting real guns at them. 
[00:13:00]  With what?  The rubber?  They went rubber bullets for now?  They went rubber bullets for now.  Some asshole on MSNBC goes, can you die from a rubber bullet?  Of course you can.  It's not easy.  It's called less lethal, not non-lethal.  Oh, that's what they call it?  Yeah, they call it less lethal.  Why would they ask that question?  Of course.  You know, a real gun will get the job done faster.  Some chick died from a beanbag gun in Boston after a World Series one.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot about that.  One year. 
[00:13:30]  Remember that?  Yeah.  She got shot in the side of the head with a fucking beanbag fired out of a shotgun and  dead.  This Egypt thing is the best TV series going, though.  It is a good one.  I love watching that.  I love when the news just blows off all the dumb shit and goes up with one thing.  One story.  It's my favorite thing in the world.  Continuous coverage.  Day and night.  Fires.  I get mad because when you wake up on the weekend, they're in the middle of the night.  I'm like, fuck.  Yeah, you got to time it.  I want to see primetime Egypt.  You got to time it when they're really out there because, yeah, it's the other part of 
[00:14:00]  the world.  When's primetime Egypt?  I think it's right now, right?  I think.  I think they're seven hours ahead of us.  Seven hours.  Because I figured it out finally so I could, you know, do my coverage.  So it's like 1.30 in the afternoon right now.  Yeah.  Could we go to like a CNN or something?  They've been going.  Yeah, we got to go to, we got local channel 5.  Yeah, fuck the local assholes.  Local people don't know shit.  Well, Fox News is on the bottom.  They got space shuttle preps.  No, we got to go, we got to go CNN.  CNN is safe.  CNN is going to do it.  We got some Fox fans in studio, MSNBC fans in studio. 
[00:14:30]  We got to go CNN.  Actually, I'm not an MSNBC fan.  They're all terrible.  And then.  I only watch it at night when they have those cool shows like Lock Up.  Well, that was the problem.  I had a mellow weekend.  I'm like, I want to watch the coverage.  So I go, I go back to MSNBC.  They're doing the Lock Up show.  CNN's doing, I don't even, I forgot what, they weren't even, they didn't have coverage either.  They had their Saturday night programming or something.  They had to have all their peeps maybe take a little napski. 
[00:15:00]  You think?  Before.  Wolf Blitzer.  Wolf Blitzer.  Wolf Blitzer's getting a lot of props for his coverage.  Was he in the Situation Room or just like?  Oh boy, was he in the Situation Room.  Yeah.  We got a situation.  And Fox has Geraldo going to town on the whole thing.  Why isn't he in Egypt?  Is he getting lazy?  Did they shut Al Jazeera down in Egypt?  Fox News is not going to do well.  Yeah.  Al Jazeera got shut down the internet, phone service.  Well, the interesting thing about the internet, they shut down the internet.  Everyone knows that by now.  But did you see the graph where stuff was still trickling in? 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And that was the stuff that we're all watching.  Yep.  So some bright motherfuckers figured out how to get stuff out anyway.  And they said it was what?  Like old school dial-up modems and stuff they were using?  It was pretty interesting because you saw the web traffic was huge.  And then there was a massive drop-off to barely anything.  And I actually thought it was foundry music after Steve left here.  But you know, folks, let me tell you.  But then there was just a little blips on the old internet graph. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, there were a couple of people somehow working it, getting it through.  Fuck.  I've seen some YouTube videos that people were taking with their phones and they were able to get that out.  Satellite phones.  How great is it that a revolution is now just broadcast?  Yeah.  The revolution will be televised.  That's what they've been saying for years, right?  You can kind of see it now.  Because the old days, you had to have a brave camera crew to go,  All right, I'll hang around and see what I can fucking film.  Now it's the people. 
[00:16:30]  Now it's people running around with their cell phones, getting what they can.  So far, favorite shot of the revolution?  The big truck backing up right into the guy's face and him falling down on his head.  It looked like something out of Dawn of the Dead.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, did that guy take a hit?  He sure did.  And the other guy falling off the armored personnel carrier.  Right, right.  It was good.  He's just there on the floor.  What about parading the dead guy around?  Yeah, that's another good one.  Like he's a float in a parade or something.  He's like the martyr. 
[00:17:00]  You go, like, hey, this is what it's for.  Dead guy.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  A lot of tweets going on.  Andy Levy.  Always.  Andy Levy is the man when it comes to news.  Andy Levy on Twitter.  You really should follow him.  He's fucking brilliant.  He's from Red Eye on Fox.  And, yeah, you should follow him.  He's very fucking funny.  What was one of his good tweets?  There were so many of them.  A lot of them.  They're just like, they're kind of snarky and concise.  Well, that's what it has to be.  Like, he just, he knows everything that's going on.  He knows all the players. 
[00:17:30]  He sees through the bullshit before the news even gets to it.  Right.  Really, just smart fucking guy, man.  Really entertaining.  Why is he staying?  This guy, this guy, we'll call him this guy.  Hosni Mubarak.  Yeah, Mubarak has to go.  Yeah, he doesn't want to.  What a dumb move.  He goes, all right, I'm going to just recreate the government in front of your eyes.  But I'm staying.  I've heard you.  My people, I have heard you.  You are upset with me.  I understand. 
[00:18:00]  I will solve the problem.  I am firing everyone that works for me.  Right.  They're working for you.  And then I will personally hire new people.  Right.  No?  Right.  You're not going home yet?  Right.  That's so stupid.  That is the dumbest idea ever.  It sounds like something management would do here.  And he just kind of threw it out there.  He threw it out there thinking it was going to fly out here.  I'm going to blue sky this way.  This is great.  They're going to love me.  I'm going to be able to walk the streets.  I'm going to be fucking riding the mosh pit.  It made it so much worse. 
[00:18:30]  It really did.  Mubarak.  No one was buying into that load of horse shit.  He wants, you know, he's been ruling for 30 years.  There's no election in Washington, right?  Not really.  Well, they've had a couple elections over his run, but very, very suspicious.  Yeah.  It's very corrupt.  It's constantly this way in those countries.  And one of his, one of his fellow candidates, you know, bitched and complained and they threw  him in jail for five years of hard labor.  So it's if you sort of have elections.  If you've ever heard about how I used to play that game Tropico, where you are the leader 
[00:19:00]  of a kind of banana republic nation and how I used to play any dissent, anybody that was  upset with me, I threw in jail.  Right.  And before you knew it, there was a revolution.  Of course.  It was fantastic.  And I tried to quell the revolution by killing or putting more people in jail and it never  worked.  Why don't we break out Tropico and see how this, you know, works out for each other.  See how it pans out.  It's not a bad idea.  You can do things like that.  Going back to Mubarak and how he fires everyone and keeps himself in place. 
[00:19:30]  I was telling you before the show, a lot of people are not fans of Obama in this country.  And imagine it comes down to where Obama goes, all right, and changes the government around  him.  I'll fire everybody.  But Obama stays as the president.  Yeah.  I don't know.  How would that work out for the people that don't like Obama?  Still not happy.  You got to get rid of the figurehead.  Still not happy.  Well, this guy's hoping to hold the office as long as he can.  And then having his boys and his boys are out of there, his boys, his boys skip  town.  His boys are in London, I think, right?  Yeah, they skip town.  But that's what he's hoping for. 
[00:20:00]  You never give up.  It's almost like a royalty.  Well, they said it was like a mob family.  Like the mob or, yeah, a combination of mob and royalty.  A lot of these countries in the Middle East, they call them like mob families because when  the one guy's done, then he wants to keep it in the family.  Yep.  So the son will take over and pretty much continue doing what the family's been doing  for years.  That's not going to work in this situation.  No.  Anybody connected with Mubarak has got to go.  And my favorite part, you said your favorite part, and I'm sure we'll talk about it. 
[00:20:30]  The guy's just ripping the heads off the mummies.  That's got to be my highlight so far.  Yeah.  Apparently some people got rambunctious.  That's some anger because you don't fuck with mummies.  You never know what the fuck is coming back to get you.  Went into some museums in Egypt and Cairo and tore the heads off of a few mummies.  And these things, they have been there for 2,000 years, undisturbed, except for some study  and things like that.  Yeah, about 2,000 years.  Probably, yeah, could be some of them longer, sure. 
[00:21:00]  And then, you know, now, 2011, some fucking guy is upset and rips your head off.  You're like, oh, God, he's ripping my head off.  I'm a mummy.  Being a piggish American, that's what made me sad.  They're like, oh, the mummies.  They're like, oh, no, they're going into the museums.  That's what got my heart straight.  I'm like, don't do the museums, please.  And you know Egypt's museums have some real cool shit.  They blow the museums away in America. 
[00:21:30]  Everything there is.  They have shit just laying around on the ground that should be in museums.  Yeah, they don't even know what to do with it.  They have so much good shit.  They're like, oh, no, not the museums.  Leave the museums alone.  That shit, people stood around the museums and locked arms so that no one else could get  it out of real shit.  Yeah, they said a lot of people started when the police left, because the police were there  at first.  Well, they bailed.  And they decided, fuck this, they're leaving.  Well, the police are kind of with the people, right?  Yeah, yeah.  And the army is kind of with the people, but they're not officially with the people. 
[00:22:00]  They're trying to keep order.  Because they don't know what to do.  Yeah, very difficult.  Trying to keep order, but they...  Which makes me think the army and Mubarak are talking, meaning the army's like, dude,  you got to get the fuck out of here.  We're going to give you a chance to get the fuck out of here, or we're taking you out.  That's my thought.  The trouble they have over there also is there's no real guy to step in.  There's a few of these guys that have come forward, but this whole thing started over  social networking, for the most part. 
[00:22:30]  So it was a collective of unhappy people saying, this motherfucker's been in here this long.  I'm impoverished.  They're rich.  There's this going on.  I don't like this.  I don't agree with this.  Let's meet and have a demonstration against this.  But it wasn't like a revolutionary, like fucking Castro was a leader.  There isn't a singular voice.  It's the voice of Twitter, of Facebook, and of all this shit.  The key to social network is you get real info, not the info the government throws at you.  You're getting info from the people, but there's no singular replacement for Mubarak now. 
[00:23:00]  So it's all these people that are dissatisfied with Mubarak and no one to fill the void.  I think they should get Ashton Kutcher, because he's one of the big Twitter guys.  Is he?  Yeah.  So you're thinking a Twitter personality?  Yeah, it's got to be one of the top ten Twitter guys has to go in there and be the leader  of Egypt now.  My favorite Twitter is, though.  Maybe Lady Gaga.  Nah, I'm thinking...  She fits in with all those mummies and shit.  I'm thinking better more than quantity.  Quality.  So I'm thinking like Louis C.K.  Or Louis C.K.  Andy Levy.  Andy Levy, you're going to be...  Andy Levy, I'm sure they love Andy Levy. 
[00:23:30]  Andy Levy is going to be the president of Egypt.  I don't think Levy is a good last name for an Egyptian president.  Andy Levy always looks like he's just almost dying of an illness.  He looks almost like he was just very sick.  He should be on a Sarah McLachlan commercial with those sad puppy eyes.  With his runny eyes in slow motion, sniffing at a cage door.  There's a guy, though, who might take over.  This guy, he's an opposition leader, Mohammed Elgaradi.  Yeah, he's a front runner.  He's the guy that's pretty much...  He's right there.  He was kind of hanging out with the protesters yesterday. 
[00:24:00]  He's trying.  But again, he's not the guy that orchestrated this and started it.  Who started it?  So he, like I said, social networking, decent franchised people.  But didn't it start with Tunisia?  They watched Tunisia?  They started seeing Tunisia, Algeria.  And why didn't Tunisia get the fucking coverage that Egypt's getting?  Because Tunisia's Tunisia and Egypt's Egypt.  Got it.  Egypt is big.  We don't get a lot of oil from Egypt, believe it or not, but that fucking canal.  Oh, that Suez Canal.  Very important.  Right.  Anything goes a little funky with that, and the gas prices go crazy. 
[00:24:30]  And then we usually have to get involved in some way, militarily, with a blockade or something.  Right, just to keep that canal open.  To keep that canal open.  Clear, yeah.  Yeah.  If that ever fell into radical Islam's hands...  This is a good enough excuse to get the gas up to $5 a gallon, right?  Oh, nothing's been blocked.  Nothing's happened yet.  Yet you see those savages at the gas stations with their big stick with the hook on the end.  You're like, getting the $5 out for the fucking first number, you pricks.  And you ask them, they go, Egypt! 
[00:25:00]  Egypt!  No, nothing's happening yet.  Oil price very easy, Egypt!  No, nothing's happening.  Nothing happened yet.  The canal's still clear, asshole.  So when it clears up...  Egypt!  So when it clears up, the next day, you're going to lower the prices?  Well, it takes a while to trickle down to us here!  Right.  Egypt!  Oh, but the price going up is instant.  Fucking assholes.  But going down, it takes a while to trickle down.  Fucking assholes.  Yeah, fuck yeah.  So the Muslim Brotherhood, huh?  Muslim Brotherhood started getting involved, yo.  Well, that's the scary part about this thing. 
[00:25:30]  If you get...  You can get a nice radical group controlling Egypt now.  Yeah, when you...  And that means Israel's kind of fucked.  Oh, Israel is looking going...  Are they a little nervous?  Going like, oh boy.  How do we know all this shit?  Oh boy.  God, one weekend watching CNN and I feel like I could fucking be a poli-sci major.  Yeah, Joe, slow down.  You just see what the fuck the savages are doing over there.  It's amazing.  Yeah, Israel is looking very, very closely at the situation. 
[00:26:00]  Wow.  I guess the Muslim Brotherhood...  Oh, here's David.  I was going to ask for David in Israel.  Oh, Muslim Brotherhood is like 15% of the crowd.  So it's not a big showing, but it's like the biggest singular united showing of one thing.  And they have a plan, obviously.  They would love a fundamentalist Islamic government in there like Iran has during the revolution.  That's not going to happen, right?  Anything could happen.  I know anything could happen.  Anything could happen over there.  And we don't have the power to prop up fucking a government in Egypt to thwart a Muslim government getting in there. 
[00:26:30]  And we just don't.  And we give Egypt $1.5 billion a year, huh?  For what?  Why don't we give them anything?  For being our pals.  Because they're our pals.  Yeah, for being our pals.  They get $1.5 billion.  So a lot of people are going, what the fuck, Obama?  You know, stop the fucking...  Cut that off.  Cut that off immediately.  Stop giving them money just to not be fucked up.  Yeah.  David in Israel.  You want to guess...  Did you look at the screen? 
[00:27:00]  Don't look.  Yeah.  We bitch about gas prices here, right?  Uh-huh.  What is it a gallon right now?  $3 or something like that?  $3 something.  $3.  $2, $3.  $3.  $3.  Push $3.  $3.  $3.  $3.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  And we're bitching because it might push to $4 for a little while, right?  Oh, yeah.  Here's David in Israel.  David, how much are you paying for a gallon of gas in Israel?  Between $7.25 and $7.50 a gallon.  What is that?  Israeli shekels?  No, that's actually about seven or eight shekels per liter.  And the dollar took a big shit. 
[00:27:30]  It's worthless these days.  So it's about between seven.  If you do the money conversion, it's between $7.25 and $7.50 a gallon.  You're right there.  I know.  Why?  You're fucking 30 feet from the oil.  I know.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah, what the fuck?  You can actually take a bucket and get your own gas.  It's so goddamn close.  You can drive to the...  Just back your car up to the well.  Right.  So you fill it up if you're not going to decapitate me.  How the fuck they figure that shit out?  Yeah, what the fuck happened?  Yeah, we pay a lot because it goes a long way to get to us. 
[00:28:00]  It's got to go on a tanker fucking ship.  It's got to come over here.  Down a canal.  It's crazy.  Yeah.  You've got a garden hose.  European prices.  I know in Europe it's also very expensive.  It goes on European markets.  That's all I know.  Yeah, but for us Americans, they try to keep that gas nice and cheap.  We pay cheap prices.  And we've got a giant country.  Relatively speaking, as far as the rest of the world goes, right?  We have a giant country.  It's very expensive to drive anywhere, you know, of distance.  Israel's kind of tiny.  How much gas are you really using? 
[00:28:30]  Actually, I drive like an asshole, so I burn about a quarter of a tank of gas.  You don't drive like an asshole.  You're just weaving around fucking...  Yeah, fucking roadside bombs and buses.  Because I would pass buses at 90 miles an hour.  I wouldn't obey one traffic law if I was in Israel.  Fuck that.  What's the mood?  How paranoid do you get when you get to a red light and there's a bus right next to you?  Oh, God.  Not at all.  Like I said before in the past, there hasn't been a bombing in a couple of years.  Can you just go jinx it?  Go ahead.  Yeah, could you just go with our dumb bit? 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, Hamas has been pretty quiet.  We're convinced that you guys are on high alert every single minute of the day.  Oh, see, it's beautiful.  Oh, yeah.  Never mind.  I'm going to punch out now.  No, no, no.  Hold on, hold on.  I want to know what the mood is there as far as paying attention to what's going on in Egypt.  Are other Israelis talking amongst each other?  And what's the general consensus of what's going to happen there?  And now I know if he's going to go ahead and just hang up with me once again.  No, actually, this is actually the only Israeli calling we have. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, my God.  If we had another guy that calls us regularly from Israel, then maybe we would do that.  Yeah, I actually want to know.  Yeah, what's the question?  I just want to know what the feeling is because the news isn't reporting on anything that Israel is saying  because they're pretty much keeping a lid on things, but the people have to be talking.  What are your buddies saying and shit?  Everything.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  That is so fucking fair. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, shalom.  He's right now just, you motherfucker.  I know.  He's going to have to get some kugel.  Some kugel to calm down.  By the way, kugel is a Jewish, I think, a dessert treat.  Yeah.  Is that the flaky one with the hard noodles?  Kind of like honey, syrupy thing.  It's terrible.  It's awful.  Yeah.  I tried to enjoy kugel.  Ava from the Comedy Cellar gave it to me, and I love Ava.  It's terrible.  It's awful.  Jewish food is not generally good. 
[00:30:30]  They're not known for their good food.  Honestly, there's a Jewish restaurant in the hood that's in the hood.  In the neighborhood, not bad.  Not bad.  Well, maybe a restaurant that kind of knows it.  But Jewish food is all based around suffering and not enjoying anything, thus you'd feel guilty.  So it's like just this bland or has bitter things in it.  It just sucks.  Israel, Jewish food, not the worst dessert, though.  Yeah?  What is?  Well, obviously, it would have to go like Asian. 
[00:31:00]  Asian restaurants have the worst desserts.  Wait a minute.  Deep frying their stupid ice cream and all that crap.  Fortune cookie.  And then I would go Greek.  Greek.  Greek has very weird, bad desserts, too.  Greek diners have like those cases of fucking cakes and shit.  You ever been there?  Yeah, but I don't know if those are like...  Are those Greeks shit?  Nah, that's just diners.  They're not like...  It's not Greek food, but Greeks own all the diners.  What?  You don't like a fucking souvlaki?  You don't like a good souvlaki?  Well, souvlaki is not a dessert. 
[00:31:30]  How about baklava?  Baklava is a dessert.  How about some baklava?  Nah, baklava sucks.  So you think this internet thing makes the United States a little nervous?  You think the stupid FCC will get their grimy hands involved and get bills out there  to shut down the internet and do other things?  There's...  But they can't...  They'll do it in such a way that it's because of terrorism or something.  But you've got to think...  The world is scared of the people at this point. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  And the control they got with this social networking.  What do you think?  What happens in the United States?  I would like to see...  The laws are passed.  If it's possible to completely shut down the internet from coast to coast in the United States.  I really would like to know if that is possible.  Too many phone companies involved.  I know it's possible.  But I want to know if it's feasible.  Now, I guess Vodafone is the big company in Egypt.  And when they were told to shut the shit off...  They shut the shit off.  They shut the shit off. 
[00:32:30]  And that pretty much shut down the internet.  But we have so many different carriers and everything.  And would they all comply?  Would the law be able to make them comply?  I have no fucking clue.  It just seems to me like it would be a lot tougher to do in a free and open society.  And to see that little trickle after they shut down the internet, I loved that.  I loved that.  It's like, what was that?  I loved that people were able to get info out even though the government said, fuck you,  we're shutting this shit down.  You know what?  You'd love to think it's some guy going, yeah, let me get these pictures out. 
[00:33:00]  And so people get...  It was probably some fat Egyptian sitting there jerking off to porn.  Right, right.  Like, oh, finally, I'm able to get some fucking nudity on my computer.  Yeah, all of a sudden his dial-up is really fast because no one else is on the network.  You're thinking, look, the revolutionaries still have the internet, man.  They're spreading the word.  It's some jacking Arab fucking...  Old school, old school...  Doggy porn.  Old school fucking dial-up guy is jerking off.  And you're one of the revolutionary guys.  Like, when you get the fuck off the computer, I've got to send this video out.  They cannot get through.  He's on a message board or leaving YouTube comments. 
[00:33:30]  It's not even real information.  Ah, shit.  Yeah, that's what they call a situation going on over there.  Fucking love it, though, man.  I'm watching all day long.  I like world events, huge world events, revolutions like that.  As long as they don't start hinting that they got some nukes.  As long as it doesn't affect me personally and my lifestyle that I enjoy,  then I'm fine with it.  Well, the fucking gas prices, so... 
[00:34:00]  Ah, you know what?  Like I said, I've been blessed with a lifestyle that I can enjoy certain pleasures in life.  You don't give a shit what gas costs.  And, you know, I put the nozzle in the Escalade.  I squeeze the handle.  I pay the man.  That's how I roll.  So when does Mubarak step down, you think?  I say...  He's got to step down at this point, right?  If the protests keep up and these people don't get lazy...  Well, the only reason...  I was thinking, how do they stop the protests?  I mean, the army's got to get crazy, but then what does that really accomplish in the end? 
[00:34:30]  Except calms it down for a little while.  Well, look at what happened in Iran when they had their little...  It wasn't like this, but they had a flare-up.  And they bailed on the whole thing, right?  And, yeah, they started...  But they're a lot more heavy-handed.  Right.  And the military would never go against Ahmadinejad.  Right.  So, but the way they handled it was kind of a little heavier-handed, and they cut people's communications off.  Like, if you can't communicate with each other as to when you're meeting, what you're doing, it does whittle down on the numbers. 
[00:35:00]  They said the numbers were dropping.  So if the numbers continue to drop, he'll stay in.  If they could keep up this looting, revolutions, fires, attacking government buildings, then he's going to have to leave within, I'd say, the week.  I just saw, it looks like it was live footage, and it looked like there was a lot of fucking people out there.  Still some pandemonium going on?  And they got the internet back up, so...  They did.  I don't know why they would do that.  What do you think the reasoning is that?  Maybe they think it's a good way to get their side out to the people. 
[00:35:30]  Or maybe the company's like, fuck you, man, we're losing money.  No, maybe whoever killed it is sympathetic to the cause.  Like, the army hasn't done anything.  That could be, too.  It's hard when you're right there and 100,000 people are screaming to not just scream with them, because you don't want to get your fucking head ripped off.  Right, yeah.  Well, we'll see.  We'll see.  I think that's it.  I think we fucking did that.  The Egypt thing, kind of.  But it's spreading out, too.  And it's giving more publicity to Tunisia, Algeria. 
[00:36:00]  Did Tunisia overthrow the government?  I don't even know the situation there.  I know Egypt is based on Tunisia.  They got a guy thrown out.  They did.  Yeah.  And they had a guy come right in?  What else is going on?  Well, there's rumblings in what?  Yemen and Jordan and where else?  Right.  Jordan, because that's been another one where, you know, the same family has just been running things.  The mob family.  I loved how they explained it that way.  That was pretty good.  Mobsters.  Meh. 
[00:36:30]  Meh.  See?  Mob family.  Meh.  We're taking over, see?  Meh.  What do you think Mubarak's doing right now?  What is he doing?  You think he's had a good night's sleep?  He's 82 years old.  He needs his sleep.  He's probably sitting back and just, like, reading, having his people bring him positive  feedback and stuff.  Oh, you think it's that bad?  Yeah.  Fucking haters.  That would be...  I don't like the haters.  That would be North Korea.  Yeah, you'd think that.  There's a far cry from North Korea.  But he's just sitting in his palace and it's like, no, we're getting this very good.  A lot of people saying, you stand by, we love you. 
[00:37:00]  And then meanwhile, everybody is just, you know, don't hate.  You think he got sad when they, like, ripped down his poster?  Oh, I think they did.  Oh, they ripped down my book.  Oh, fuck you.  You are blocked.  I block you.  I block you.  Oh, look at this one.  Hosni, you are great.  I love you.  Not.  Oh, I'll block you.  You think he's blocked a couple million on Twitter?  He's making so many people on Twitter. 
[00:37:30]  Unfriending people on his Facebook.  They're putting bad things on his wall.  Well, whatever.  I think if...  What does that say?  Of course I'm worried.  What does that say on CNN?  Blair on Egypt Crisis and Mideast Peace.  Oh, Blair?  What are they still talking to him for?  Exactly.  The fucking facts of life ended years ago.  Who cares what she says?  Of course I know my cousin looks pussy.  Tony Blair.  Tony Blair.  He looks more distinguished than he did when he was in.  Yeah, he looks younger, right?  Yeah. 
[00:38:00]  Something happens when you leave office.  You gain a few years back.  Yeah.  Right?  Just a few years back.  You go backwards a little bit.  All right, so we're only going to get one to three inches.  No, I'd say one to three.  But they love saying we're looking at six inches in our area because their area covers the north and west.  They're calling that part one of the snow event.  Oh, part one.  Here's part two.  And then we have a low building off the Virginia coast, which could work its way.  Blah, blah, blah.  I don't care. 
[00:38:30]  It doesn't matter to me.  I don't care.  The Mexicans come.  They shovel my driveway.  That's all good, right?  That's all I care about.  All right.  I love it.  I pay them.  Should we take our first break?  Give them some chips, salsa.  That's all they need.  That's all they need.  Yes.  Keep shoveling.  Chip, what?  What do we break?  What's that?  Yes.  Of course.  I see grub.  Yeah, we got grub.  We have poundstone power.  The power lifter.  What the hell is this? 
[00:39:00]  He bends things.  He rips things.  He's very strong.  He bends things and rips things.  Yes.  He's very strong.  He's like Kenny, but on purpose.  If he does the frying pan thing, I'm going to fucking puke.  Why?  What is it?  Rolling up the frying pan?  Yeah, because it's...  That's kind of hard, though.  It's hard, but it's not...  We should have brought in...  I'll bring in a frying pan and see if you can actually fucking bend it.  Well, they do an aluminum one.  Yeah, not the...  They do the aluminum one.  Not the fucking light...  But it's still hard.  And they use their leg.  Of course it's still hard. 
[00:39:30]  They bash down.  But it makes it...  But then you, you know, sitting at home go, wow, man, fuck.  Holy shit.  He just like fucking rolled up a frying pan like the one I got under my stove.  Holy shit.  Do one of those cast iron ones you cook breakfast in?  Then I'll be impressed.  All your family's breakfast, sausages.  Sam, what's Poundstone Power, the power lifter?  Poundstone Power.  He's the real deal.  And I just read that he's going to be in the Polar Plunge during the Special Olympics this Saturday.  I guess that's where you swim in the ocean, even though it's cold. 
[00:40:00]  There's a Polar Plunge in the Special Olympics?  But get this.  Oh, you'd have to be a retard to go in the water.  Is that cold?  It's very cold, yes.  Yes, it is.  Before...  That's a good one.  Before jumping in the ocean, he's going to pull a fire engine across a hotel parking lot.  Does this guy think it's like Wide World of Sports, 1975?  What the fuck, dude?  We've got the internet now.  I'm amazed by shit I see on YouTube.  I don't need fucking guys doing carniacs. 
[00:40:30]  Speaking of which, HBO has a whole show on Jim McKay and his career.  Jim McKay?  Fucking worth checking out if you're an old school sports guy.  Hell fucking yeah.  What else is this dope going to do?  He can break a baseball bat over your head.  That would be interesting.  Really?  He can break a baseball bat.  Don't baseball players do that many times a season?  And that was a broken bat.  And easily picked off to end the inning.  Only very strong baseball players can do that. 
[00:41:00]  He can do that.  How does he break it?  With his hands.  He just snaps them.  He snaps it?  Yeah, because he's so strong.  Why isn't this guy using his powers to help?  He is.  Strong people we could use.  He should be on call to lift cars off of people.  He's a cop.  What?  That's right.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  Why did we book this guy?  Because he can even bend things and break things.  And he said he wanted to lift E-Rock up.  Oh, okay.  Wait a minute.  Wow, okay.  Now, fuck the pot and pan. 
[00:41:30]  Fuck the newspaper or the phone book ripping.  He wants to lift E-Rock?  He said he could lift E-Rock.  All right.  Oh, damn.  So what is he going to do?  Lift up E-Rock?  We booked a guy to lift E-Rock today.  Well, listen to this.  How about lifting him up mentally?  That's what he needs.  Will we book God?  Hold on, hold on.  Our guest today is the very obese and clumsy Eric Nagel.  Eric, please tell the audience what you did wrong now. 
[00:42:00]  Clumsy.  You know, now whenever there's anything wrong with this channel or the show, they just fucking  use that Nagel word.  Oh, my God.  The replay was Nagel.  It went back to last week.  All right, right.  What happened there?  Because I heard that.  Eric doesn't like that, by the way.  Eric doesn't like it.  Was it Nagel, though?  It was Nagel.  Are you sure it wasn't?  Danny's saying, yes, it was Nagel.  It might have been Ross.  It was Nagel by me.  Ross Nagel did. 
[00:42:30]  See, Ross Nagel did.  What'd you do?  It still fucks with E-Rock.  Well, you know how sometimes you think it's Thursday when it's Wednesday?  Yeah.  It sure happens at Carvel all the time.  I was so sick this weekend.  I was fucking, I was Nageling and vomiting at the same time.  I'm sorry, Eric.  I don't mean that.  It's just fun to say.  It is fun.  He doesn't like it when you guys use his name like that, and he doesn't even understand  how it started.  I don't either.  His surname?  I think he loves it.  Oh, I'm sure you don't know how it started, Sam. 
[00:43:00]  No.  I think he loves it.  So, what else is this power lifter going to do?  We'll wait till you hear this.  Because every day, he makes a shake with two pounds of unseasoned chicken and 40 ounces  of water, because it's good for protein.  And he drinks it?  That's what, and he drinks that.  Sounds disgusting.  Dude, he's going to have fucking diverticulitis.  He probably doesn't eat any vegetables.  I'm going to scold him about eating his veggies.  Diverticulitis.  That's disgusting.  Yeah, that's when you get like little pockets.  And he sent me, he's...  Ferments.  Fluid.  He sent rundowns on how he could help everybody on the show's nutrition, because I guess him 
[00:43:30]  or the guy he works with is a big fan of the show.  Oh, really?  He said that your man boobs he could get rid of.  He said he could help...  Who's that?  You better specify, because now everybody's gone.  Yeah, really?  Jim.  I'm about to point.  You pointed at Jim.  Jim.  I've been eating much better.  You tell that to Poundstone Power.  I've lost a little bit of weight.  I think you look great, but tell that to Poundstone.  He said, Anthony, that he could help you.  No one can help me.  Make your alcohol more of something that a powerlifter would drink. 
[00:44:00]  More bodybuilding.  Oh, really?  Like throw some nutrition in there?  Can I throw some chicken in my wine and mix it up and drink it?  That sounds great.  Opie, he brought up that you maybe start rollerblading to work again.  I haven't rollerbladed in a few years now.  Although he did say you're probably getting enough exercise ripping up those Islanders tickets.  A little show reference.  Oh, show reference.  What an asshole.  Opie's a dad.  He can't risk his fucking life on the streets on rollerblades anymore. 
[00:44:30]  I miss.  Jesus Christ.  I miss those days.  Holding on to the trucks.  Yep.  That was fun.  He's sketching.  I used to.  Like McFly.  When Jimmy used to live down in, I forget, 43rd Street, I was up in the 70s.  I'm like, you know what?  The easiest way to get to Jimmy is right down 8th Avenue on my rollerblades.  Not 8th.  9th Avenue.  It would be 9th Avenue to be local for everyone.  And I would just fucking do 9th Avenue on my rollerblades and go see Jimmy for a little  while.  I've never rollerbladed in my life.  No. 
[00:45:00]  I'm scared of her.  It looks dangerous.  It's kind of stupid.  I have a canker sore.  Oh, no.  Oh, shit.  In my mouth.  In my jaw, it's a canker sore?  Yeah.  You should just say you got a herp, a blister.  Got the herp in your mouth.  So you just say canker or...  No, it would hurt more if it was her.  You got a shanker sore.  I get it?  Because that's from VD.  Oh, is it?  A shanker.  If it was a herpes sore in the mouth, I don't think it would hurt more than this one does.  This one's just annoying.  You should drink some orange juice.  All right, dude.  I ate fucking four organic oranges yesterday. 
[00:45:30]  Yay.  Organic fruit sucks.  No, these are the best oranges I've ever had.  Fuck.  Didn't it sting your canker?  Yes, it did.  In most cases, organic vegetables and fruits suck.  Organic, everything stinks.  They look sickly in the supermarket.  Yeah.  I want it pumped up with some shit.  No taste to them.  I love these oranges.  They're amazing.  Then you lucked out, man, because in most cases, it just is a very sad display, that organic  section.  I sent them into Orange Monthly to try to get them to centerfolds.  Nice.  I took photos of them.  Orange Monthly. 
[00:46:00]  That was amazing.  I love that one.  Speaking of food, Sam, you got anything else for us today before we take a break?  Oh!  I have a surprise.  You have a surprise for everybody?  Cool, cool.  Are you ready for it now, or when we get back?  I hope it rhymes with moicide.  It doesn't.  What would your surprise be?  Oh.  Maybe.  Let me guess.  Let me guess.  Not guess, but let me just get a hint.  Is the surprise something that would be considered tasty? 
[00:46:30]  The surprise is very sweet.  Okay.  Is the surprise...  Very good.  The DNA test came back.  No.  And you're now going to make less money.  Yes.  But you can sleep in later.  Yes.  And he brought in some fucking collard greens for himself for lunch.  I couldn't think of another soul food.  That's a suck.  That's a good one.  No, it's not the DNA test. 
[00:47:00]  Okay.  Yep.  All right.  Does it have something to do with your wonderful mommy?  Yes, it does.  Bobby.  Yes, it does.  Bobby.  What did Bobby do?  All right.  Did she do what she was supposed to do?  It's a surprise.  If she did, Sam wouldn't be here.  There'd be a curly-headed lump in a dumpster.  Oh, shit.  That's not nice.  That's not nice, but it's funny and true.  Yes.  First feeling, so...  No, you're a good guy.  Although an abortion would have been perfect for you. 
[00:47:30]  I'm scratchy.  You are scratchy.  It's scratchy, Jimmy.  Go ahead, sweetie.  Why don't we eat?  You ready?  I'm already eating.  Oh, we'll do it after the break, Dan.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  After the break.  After the break, the big reveal.  I'll be ready for, you know, the big reveal.  I'll be ready for the surprise.  The big reveal, and we'll have Bobby on the phone.  Oh, good.  Because I want to make sure she stayed up all night to do this.  I know.  Because she doesn't like when her stuff isn't fresh.  She doesn't.  And is there whipped cream to go with any treats that there might be? 
[00:48:00]  Maybe there will be after break.  Oh, they're calling you Jim Klugman.  Old half a larynx.  I can't talk, Sam.  I was very sick this weekend.  But I'm better.  All right.  We'll break, and we'll have the big reveal from Sam's mom, Bobby.  We'll have Bobby on the phone once again after the break, right?  Yeah, she pretends she doesn't like it.  Hey, this is Billy Coenley.  Hey, this is Frank Vincent.  Hey, this is Quentin Tarantino.  Hey, this is Richard Dreyfuss. 
[00:48:30]  Hey, this is John C. Reilly.  Hey, this is Kevin Smith.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Two dudes I could sit around and talk to for hours, and have sat around and talked to for hours.  I want to say good morning to Rich Voss.  We weren't sure if Jimmy was going to make it in today.  He was a little under the weather over the weekend.  So we said, Rich, why don't you come in and do some radio with us? 
[00:49:00]  So we got Rich today.  And Jimmy, which is good.  I haven't done the show with Rich in a while.  Seriously?  Yeah, man.  Usually we haven't been when you're not here.  Oh, that makes sense.  Patrice, the guys I like doing radio with, I rarely get to see.  Then we should just get those guys in while you're here as well.  You just said you like doing it with Patrice?  And Rich is in a high chair today because he can't figure out how to get his seat down.  No, no, I can't figure out how to get it.  It's broken.  It's broken like everybody in here.  You're way...  We're all broken.  Don't rub it in. 
[00:49:30]  Thanks for repeating my joke.  Shut up.  I'm not my bandwagon this early.  Jesus Christ.  You're pretty high up in the air there, Rich.  I know.  I feel like...  I think we're going to force you to just...  Like a ruler.  You don't want to be a ruler these days.  I bring you news from the north.  Take them down.  Hey, Rich, what do you think of the situation in Egypt?  What's your thoughts?  Everyone's talking about it.  We've got the coverage in front of us here.  What does it have to do with bananas in Poughkeepsie?  You know, I was there this weekend.  I know, this weekend. 
[00:50:00]  What I was...  What's your two cents on this?  Here's the deal.  Yes, let's go.  What's the lesser of two evils?  You know, you get rid of this guy who's been ruling the country for 30 years, but he's  an ally to America and, you know, Israel semi, at least, more than most of the other countries,  or you overthrow him and you bring in some, you know, dictator that was, well, you know,  one of the biggest countries in the Middle East or the biggest country, and now they're  enemies of America and Israel.  So what do you do? 
[00:50:30]  You're caught between a rock and a hard place.  I don't know what we can do.  But that was pretty good, wasn't it?  It is pretty good.  We can't really do anything.  We can't really do anything.  No, you just basically admitted you didn't know what to do.  Right.  We're just hoping they got somebody in there we could deal with and, you know, is more  toward our liking.  They're monitoring.  Look, White House monitoring uprising.  Egypt must plan a way forward.  That's saying we can't do shit.  We know it.  We're just hedging our bet, and whatever side wins, we want to be able to talk to them. 
[00:51:00]  And I love the fact that the U.S. keep our fucking nosy faces out of it.  It's none of our fucking business.  Yes.  None of our business what they do in Egypt.  Well, you don't think it's anybody?  None of our fucking business.  Okay.  You want, you want, uh, none.  Honestly, dude, I'm sick of us meddling and giving them money just to do what we want.  We're looking out for ourselves, so it is our fucking business.  It's not our business, dude.  It's their country.  But if you're trying to keep, if you're trying to keep somebody from being your enemy, who's  a superpower, or a semi-superpower. 
[00:51:30]  They're not a superpower.  A semi-superpower.  They have a fucking less than a half million people in the army.  We'd fucking massacre Egypt.  Yeah, but we had to.  But when you get enough of those countries that are semi-superarmies collaborating together  against us, you've got to keep as many allies as you possibly can.  Obviously, you've never played Risk before, okay?  Please, I never want a condom ever.  But dude, they can't unite to fucking, they hate Israel more than they'll ever hate us.  And they can't unite to fucking crush Israel.  They're not, it's, that's what we tell ourselves. 
[00:52:00]  It's not our fucking business.  And then if they do something that is a violation to us, our response should be fucking harsh and barbaric.  I think because we depend on the oil in that area so much, that the Suez Canal has a huge  meaning to the United States.  That's the only thing.  Fuck everything else in Egypt.  The Suez Canal, though, is huge.  If that got taken over, access to that got taken over by extremist Islamic government, we 
[00:52:30]  would have to do something.  We'll go to fucking Alaska, get the oil there.  Enough with these fucking people.  Enough with this whole shitty...  Oh, believe me, I would love to.  Fucking area of the world.  I'm sick of our troops being over there and our fucking noses being, it's none of our  business.  Yeah, it would be great if we didn't have to get any oil from them.  Fuck them, let them sell it to China and fucking India.  Let them be their slaves.  But I like, like, I don't, it is, that's like saying it's none of our business what goes  on anywhere else and it's none of our fucking business.  And it is our business because it's like none of our business if, uh, if Iran comes up 
[00:53:00]  with a nuclear weapon.  Of course it's our business because it fucking affects us if they, if they decide to use  it.  So anytime there's a possible enemy towards the fucking, this country, not even getting  involved with Israel because of them being an ally in a, you know, in the Middle East  towards us, anything that affects us is our fucking business.  That's not true.  I mean, I, I know what you're saying to emotionally.  I agree with you.  I hate these countries, hate them.  I don't think Iran should have nukes, but you know what?  Let Israel deal with Iran. 
[00:53:30]  Israel is perfectly capable of dealing with Iran.  It's not our fucking business.  They're not going to nuke us.  They're going to nuke Israel.  So let Israel who has the balls to actually do what they need to do. </pre>
