<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of E-Rock’s weight loss struggles and his continued fast food consumption, culminating in E-Rock leaving the studio.  The hosts then recounted their disastrous snowed-in trip to Richmond, Virginia, resulting in a missed broadcast and a paltry six cookies from room service as compensation. This led to a humorous anecdote about a cab ride from the Richmond airport, where Kenny revealed he'd use lottery winnings for a sex change, sparking an awkward conversation with their Kenyan driver. The conversation returned to E-Rock's diet and the difficulties of maintaining lifestyle changes.  Technical difficulties with the phone lines ensued, followed by a discussion of the upcoming *Lost* finale, Opie’s plan to be the last to watch, and a comical review of a *Quincy, M.E.* episode. Anthony then detailed his malfunctioning home theater system, threatening his *Lost* viewing party.  Near-miss taxi accidents and a recap of a hornet's nest video featuring Opie were also discussed. A lucky caller managed to get through despite the phone line issues. The show ended with Anthony’s frustration about his home theater and the unpredictable phone system.

The show continued with discussions of their frustrations with NYC taxi drivers, near-misses, and Opie’s increasingly aggressive driving in response.  Kenny’s reluctance to use his horn was highlighted, leading to more near-accidents.  The hosts then discussed their morning routine and in-car interactions, including Opie's joke about brushing his teeth in the car, which disturbed Kenny.  Their eating habits in the car were also criticized, causing further stress for Kenny.  They briefly touched on car design, focusing on horn usability. A listener suggested freight train horns, sparking a discussion about car horns and backup cameras, including a bizarre anecdote about a penis picture in a car's backup camera. The segment concluded with discussions of Groundhog Day, including audio clips of the pronouncements, Nancy Pelosi's spending, and the creation of an "all-star black team," debating the inclusion of various historical figures.

A significant portion of the show involved compiling this "All-Star Black Team," featuring figures like Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, and Jackie Robinson, with discussions about inclusion criteria, the Big Bopper’s race, Emmett Till, and Barack Obama. Listener calls contributed to the discussion. The show then shifted to the Super Bowl, including team preferences, a rejected gay dating site commercial, reactions to an interracial couple in an eHarmony commercial, and the NFL/CBS’s perceived hypocrisy regarding on-air language. A segment featuring a "talent coach" and highly graphic, sexually explicit listener calls about seduction attempts during the Super Bowl followed. The show also included commentary on Oscar and Razzie nominations, interspersed with off-color humor and a pre-recorded, extremely vulgar and sexually explicit comedic bit by "Steve C."

The show included a segment focusing on the 2009 Oscar nominations, featuring vulgar criticisms of nominated films like *Avatar*, *Precious*, and *The Hurt Locker*,  discussions about realism in film, Rip Torn's alleged rehab, and preferences for contemporary rock music (favoring UK bands). A lengthy discussion on zombie films and a ranking attempt followed. Listener calls, including Coke Logic, contributed to the discussion.  A significant portion revolved around graphic, sexually explicit comments about Helen Mirren and Susan Sarandon's daughter, along with discussions of other actresses and internet pornography. A caller discussed Bob Kelly's Comedy Central taping invitation, and the segment ended with a charades game guessing "Susan Sarandon’s daughter’s uneven breasts."

The final segment contained sexually explicit conversations about various actresses, featuring crude comments about their appearances and age, along with speculation about sexual acts.  A caller, Chris from Jersey, contributed a sexually suggestive acronym.  The hosts also discussed sexting, dating dynamics, and imagined sexual exploits of hospital staff.  They spent considerable time looking at and commenting on pictures of actresses, using graphic and offensive language.  The conversation meandered between various topics, always returning to the sexually explicit theme, and ended abruptly as the hosts prepared to leave.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I didn't realize the show was on the road.  It's on the road.  Hi, everyone.  Well, we all survived our way into work today.  That's good.  Apparently so.  What is this, E-Rock?  E-Rock just hands me discs.  What is this?  It's not food.  This isn't the Bobo thing.  The other Bobo thing.  The brand new one that Stephen, Derek made yesterday.  Someone's looking a little slimmer.  E-Rock's got a trainer, right?  He's looking like he lost some weight. 
[00:00:30]  Slow down.  A little slimmer.  Yeah, a little slimmer.  Believe me, I'm not saying you're fuckable yet.  Thank you.  Are you suffering?  Because you can't eat the shit you want to eat?  Yeah, that and just getting the shit kicked out of me during the training session.  That's why it'll never work, by the way.  No offense.  I mean, you'll look good for about six months, and then you'll go back to being like a slob.  A slob.  No, because it takes ridiculous discipline.  I'm not just talking E-Rock.  I'm talking about everybody that thinks they could just completely change their ways and 
[00:01:00]  slim down and stay like that.  You've got to learn.  Are you learning?  Yeah.  Or when you lose all the weight, you're going to go right back to eating all that fast food  stuff.  It's a whole way of life.  That could happen, too.  That's right.  You've got to change.  It's a whole way of life.  You know, I probably should be a little more positive, but I've seen this a million times.  People that all of a sudden lose a lot of weight, start looking good.  They have a trainer.  They're eating salads.  They're suffering.  Every salad they throw down, they're trots.  And then a few months go by, and they're like, fuck this, and they go right back to 
[00:01:30]  where they were at.  I don't think you need to be more positive.  I think you are very positive.  No offense.  You're not the only piece of shit who can't make it.  It's a nightmare.  It's hard.  I mean, many years later, I'm still struggling with that, the discipline.  I want to eat everything.  Everything's delicious.  It's delicious?  A lot of people make the mistake they lose to 50 pounds, let's say, and they're like,  oh, there you go.  I don't have to do anything anymore.  I lost the weight.  And then start sneaking the bad food back into their diet. 
[00:02:00]  It's hard to eat yourself.  Why did E-Rock leave?  The only reason we're talking about this is because of E-Rock.  And then he walks out.  And now he walks out, so now this means nothing to anybody.  He just walks out.  No one wants fucking diet tips on our show.  Maybe it's part of his training.  He has to walk around the entire complex every time he gets hungry.  This is how weak I am.  When we were snowed out in Richmond on Saturday, room service was a nightmare because everyone  in the hotel was snowed in.  So it took an hour and a half.  That sounds fun, though.  Everyone's snowed in.  It is, unless you're losing a lot of money.  If you're not losing money, it's fine.  But I was losing money. 
[00:02:30]  I was losing a lot of money.  But it was a good amount.  It was two shows.  Yeah, we didn't even talk about this.  Jim goes down to, what, Richmond?  Yeah.  And he gets snowed in.  So all the shows Saturday were canceled.  So him and Kenny were just stuck in a hotel Friday night, Saturday night.  That sounds fun.  And then finally left Sunday with nothing to do.  We tried to book a train out Saturday night, but it was all sold out because 70% of the  airport flights were canceled.  Choo-choo.  And the next morning we booked a flight.  I had a flight booked, but it was going to be a lot of traffic.  Yeah.  So we took a train five hours earlier, but there was a five-hour delay on the train. 
[00:03:00]  And so we went back to the hotel and slept and then took our flight.  But anyway, the night before I would have-  You probably could have drove out, for real.  It was bad, man.  It was really-  It might have been drivable at a four-by-four, but it was bad.  I mean, I understood why the shows were canceled.  I wasn't even mad.  I was like, ah, the club kind of had to.  It was fucking horrible because people couldn't get out of the driveway.  Wow.  But I ordered room service.  Yeah.  And they felt bad because they came an hour and a half after I ordered.  So they gave me six big cookies as a way to say we're sorry.  Oh, thanks. 
[00:03:30]  Three chocolate chip and three white macadamia.  Oh, how great is that?  Did you just scoff them all up?  I ate three.  And I texted Kenny to see if he wanted it.  But of course, fucking Mr. I beat myself with fucking belts and olive branches.  No, thank you.  Nothing fun, nothing happy.  Nothing happy, nothing fun.  Nothing fun, nothing happy.  Nothing happy, nothing fun.  We've been with Kenny for a long time.  I don't know what makes him happy.  I've tried. 
[00:04:00]  I took him to FH Riley's for a little lunch last week.  He couldn't have ordered more bland, more blander.  You have to force him just to eat something fun.  It's just unbelievable.  It's like, Kenny, enjoy yourself just a little bit.  I'm not saying get a sloppy pasta dish, but how about you live a little?  Just a little.  He was so funny on the way.  We had to take, we got a cab from the hotel to the airport.  And it was, again, the roads were still bad, man.  There was a lot of snow on the ground.  So the guy that picks us up is a black guy, and he's very chatty, nice guy, but the whole 
[00:04:30]  ride's from Kenya.  And he's yapping the whole time.  It was like uncomfortable because he's doing 55 miles an hour on snow.  And he's answering his fucking phone.  And turning to talk to you guys.  Talking to Kenny, and he's in awe of the snow.  You know, it's like.  Oh, that's good.  That's what you want.  We don't get this where I'm from.  That's Caribbean.  That's all right.  That fits.  But that's what you want to hear as he's going 55 miles an hour.  That means he has no experience driving in snow.  He was surprisingly controlled. 
[00:05:00]  And then the lottery story came over the radio or something.  So he says to Kenny, what would you do with that kind of money?  And Kenny goes, I would get a sex change operation.  And the guy's like, what, Kenny, you tell us.  It was, I was really fucking.  See, this is what Kenny does for fun.  You know, we just answer our own question.  But the best part is.  But he has more than one question.  When I said that, I heard Jimmy in the back seat go, ugh. 
[00:05:30]  I was like, ugh.  Because again, the guy is like, how did he get into the part about you?  Are you liking girls?  Yeah, because there was a big lottery, mega millions.  And somebody won like 150 million.  And then he asked me, what would I do?  I go, I want a sex change.  And then he kind of like looked at me because he was a little taken back.  I don't know why.  I don't know why.  And then he's like, he just was asking questions.  I don't know. 
[00:06:00]  He goes, like, how many?  I go, I don't like girls.  You know, and then he's like, well, how many guys?  How many bullets would you take?  He goes.  Bullets.  And when the guy was saying that, I'm thinking, this guy's from Kenya.  I don't know what his religion is.  I don't know if he's, like, really offended.  Because as Kenny is talking about, I don't like girls.  I like a lot of different cock.  And then he's saying that there's someone in here saying, I got a big, delicious cock waiting at home for me.  And I'm not kidding.  We're going 50.  Up to almost 65. 
[00:06:30]  And I'm like, this guy just wants to get us out of the fucking car.  That's good.  On a snowy road, by the way.  I was really nervous.  And I'm like, what the fuck is he?  Kenny, shut up.  You're offending this guy.  And he's like, how many bullets can you, how long do your bullets go?  He's, like, asking Kenny how long he can fuck for.  And Kenny's like, I don't know how long the guy fucks him for.  It was so uncomfortable.  Oh, God, how uncomfortable.  Yeah, it was really a homoerotic conversation.  And Kenny's like, I like a lot of different cocks, not just one cock.  Yeah, I told him I'd be a real slut. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, yeah.  I'd be a real slut.  So that was the fucking horrible drive to the airport.  Yeah, I forgot about that.  It was really funny.  That's awesome.  Yeah, so we're back.  But that was all about to talk about Erock's food.  But they kill you with the six cookies.  You know what?  I mean, how do you not eat the six cookies?  You're trapped in the room.  The cookies are taunting you.  Yeah.  And that's why it's almost impossible to completely change your lifestyle and, you know, change what you look like.  It's almost impossible.  Where did Erock go? 
[00:07:30]  He knows it's true.  Of course he does.  He knows it's true.  Where is he, though?  He went for a snack.  Who walks out in the middle of a chat like that?  He literally walked out in the middle.  I was going to try to, like, give him some good, positive fucking...  It was upsetting.  What?  It was upsetting.  No, he was...  Look, he's walking down the hall now.  Yeah, this idea of exercise.  The trainer goes, just walk faster from there.  I want to know what he's learning.  Yeah.  Erock, you got a trainer, right?  And you're on a diet.  What are you learning?  We're just busting your pork chops. 
[00:08:00]  Because I guess we should be positive and go right on.  You're trying to, like, fucking lose a little weight and get in shape.  But what are you learning that when the trainer goes away and you're finally sick of eating  salads every day that you're going to be able to keep this up?  Well, I've never really done any...  Exercise?  Well, that too.  Any of the weight exercise.  Usually it's always...  Do you like doing it?  It's difficult.  Oh, you're so fucked.  No, you don't just love doing it. 
[00:08:30]  You've got to grow into it.  Well, I got to the point where I kind of like going to the gym, but it took a while.  If you're like, oh, this is like another job, it's not going to work.  Somehow you've got to figure out how to like this.  No, it's getting used to using the weights and learning the right way to use them, which  is what I'm doing right now.  And I'm starting to like it.  It just sucks, but you've got to plow through it.  Right.  And what kind of diet they got, Sean?  It's not too, like, super strict, but it does limit, you know, obviously a lot of 
[00:09:00]  the crap that you're supposed to eat.  But a lot of it is protein.  Right.  Are you craving any of your old foods?  Actually, I kind of got sick of the fast food right before all this started.  I just kind of gorged on fast food.  And I just like, it got to the point where I couldn't look at it anymore.  I just got really sick of it.  So I'm pretty much, with rare exceptions, I'm pretty much done with the fast food stuff. 
[00:09:30]  So maybe it does make this big change.  Maybe.  That's tough, though.  It really is tough.  It's that powdered protein stuff that's really...  You don't like it?  It's difficult.  Why?  Do you like the protein in its liquid form?  You want a little batch?  You can jazz that shit up.  I drink that shit.  It's easy.  Yeah.  Mixing in with drinks, with oatmeal.  Oh, that's why.  You got to jazz it up with fucking some yogurt and some fresh fruit.  Well, a couple of people are suggesting you jazz it up with shotgun pellets. 
[00:10:00]  Exactly.  How about a little succinylcholine?  Are you down on your iron?  That's why.  You can't put that shit in oatmeal.  That's disgusting.  You're supposed to.  You're supposed to have it three times a day.  Oh, fuck that.  I can't do that.  The teaspoon of it is like this big.  Oh, yeah.  Here comes the taste of it.  It's like that big.  You know, when we talk to E-Rock about his weight and his diet, Sam can't help but come 
[00:10:30]  in and just shine in.  Here comes Mr. Reality.  I think E-Rock should better define what rare exception is for fast food.  All right.  I don't want a fucking rat.  Okay.  But tell them why, Sam.  I'll say this.  Well, why didn't you tell us the why?  I'll tell you the why is because, you know.  Wait, no.  Let's Sam say, let's Sam define the fucking fast food thing.  E-Rock has indulged on fast food at least once a week since he's been on the trainer,  and I don't think he's counting Subway as fast food either. 
[00:11:00]  No, because you're allowed on the diet, the turkey on whole wheat, you're allowed to have.  But he has, he goes down to Wendy's once a week.  Yeah, but the last couple times we went, I didn't order anything.  Really?  The last couple times we went with Roland the other day?  Yes, because who guilts me into going down and buying them lunch all the time, Sam?  What did you have for lunch, E-Rock, when we went down with Roland?  I had the grilled chicken.  I saw you said you didn't order anything last time.  No, the last couple times I didn't order anything. 
[00:11:30]  What did you have?  Well, this is Sam's last lunch anyway, so it's all right.  What did you have?  I had grilled chicken.  Sam, you don't want to bite the hoof that feeds you.  No, E-Rock, you're allowed to have the Subway, that fucking bready sandwich?  Honestly, I got it.  I know that, but Jared is actually, that's how Jared lost all his weight.  The Subway, whole wheat, fucking bread, turkey, and all the best.  The whole wheat are the nine-grain whole wheat.  But what do you put on it?  Mustard. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, mustard?  It's mustard, lettuce, tomato, pickle.  I would love to kill him on that, but that is actually a good lunch to have.  Do you go for the whole or the half?  No, it's the whole.  Well, then that's...  He's a hungry boy.  Now that goes back to Jimmy's point that that might be a little too much fucking bread.  Well, Jared, I'm saying that was the sandwich that that guy Jared lost to lose all his weight.  I mean, I guess it is pretty healthy as far as Subway is concerned.  I guess.  Take a little look at Jared.  Eh.  Yeah.  He's getting back to where he used to be slowly but surely.  Maybe he got off of that whole thing.  So what does he order at Wendy's? 
[00:12:30]  Some grilled chicken?  Last time he was down there, he orders grilled chicken, but it's saucy.  And it's not a whole wheat bun.  Yeah, it's honey mustard.  It's not good for you.  Honey mustard is not the best.  And a soda and fries.  It's the meal.  Yeah.  Is that true?  Yeah, but the fries were nowhere finished because that was divvied out to Roland.  No, Roland had his own fries.  No, Roland had his own fries too, but.  Roland's not on a diet. 
[00:13:00]  The whole thing just falls apart.  I know.  He comes in here all proud and working out.  The protein powders bother me, but I'm doing it.  I'm doing it.  I'm off the fast food.  I'm off the fast food.  It makes me sick, but he goes to Wendy's once a year.  Well, there's another thing that goes on around here, Anthony.  They all guilt E-Rock into buying them lunch.  How many lunches are you up to buying a day?  Are you kidding?  A day?  Oh.  Let's try a week.  Let's see.  One, two. 
[00:13:30]  They guilted him.  I think anywhere, sometimes it can go up to six lunches a week between those two.  Wow.  He got guilted into buying lunch for people that don't make a lot of money.  Damn.  Fuck that.  Troy and me started reminding E-Rock that if they combined our two salaries,  they still wouldn't reach E-Rock's exorbitant salary.  Exorbitant.  So we mention that every single Friday, and he gets guilty and buys us lunch.  Sam laughing through that. 
[00:14:00]  What a fucking prick.  Hey, remember those days, Sam?  All right, so you're almost doing okay, right?  Doing better than I was, yes.  A lot better.  You look like you lost a few pounds.  I can see you, Rock.  He's, uh...  You were definitely born again hard!  He's lost a little weight, but...  And I don't mean to be a dick, but it's really fucking hard, man.  It's not easy to completely change your lifestyle like that.  That's why most people are fucking getting the weight back.  Uh, learning, uh, learning how to do, uh, exercises with the weights is really difficult.  And eventually you're not gonna be, uh, you know, drinking that fucking protein powder. 
[00:14:30]  You're gonna have to bail on that eventually.  You can't drink that shit every day.  Does that put weight on you?  No.  Depends how you find...  It's a whole thing.  Depends on what protein powder you fucking choose and what you add with the protein powder.  It's complicated.  Anything else, Sam?  E-Rock?  No, that's it.  No.  What do you have for lunch today?  What would you like a lunch for you?  You wanna go down to Wendy's?  Why didn't you mention the Wendy's? 
[00:15:00]  That's kind of...  Yeah, yeah.  That's kind of important to this whole...  I'm getting...  By the way, last time...  Last time we went down, Roland bought...  Not E-Rock.  Oh, okay.  Oh, shit.  And Roland's out of work.  Exactly.  Roland's a little rotund himself, you know.  Roland likes doing dogs.  Yeah, yeah.  Just saying.  Roland's gonna kick your ass.  He likes to treat himself well, that's all.  I wouldn't fuck Roland.  Tasty treats.  All right.  Wendy's is good.  You gotta love it. 
[00:15:30]  Gotta love Wendy's.  Nothing wrong with Wendy's.  Right, E-Rock?  That's just done right.  Not my place of choice, but...  What?  No?  That wasn't my place of choice, no.  What was your poison?  These two are going down there all the time.  Oh, so blame it on them.  They jacked at Wendy's.  No, seriously, because every time they want to go, I try to go somewhere else, and they  get into Wendy's.  And then I just have to eat when I get there.  What's your...  He threw his gum at him.  What's your place of choice?  It used to be McDonald's.  McDonald's.  Yeah.  Mickey D's, as the brothers say. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  In every commercial.  No more.  Huh?  No more.  No more.  Except for the Wendy's once a week.  All right.  Yeah, Wendy's.  But he rocks doing well.  And people are noticing, so keep it up there.  Whatever.  There it goes.  Let me say hi to Dan in Knoxville, Tennessee.  Dan, what's going on?  First call of the day.  Make it good.  Hey, okay.  Don't forget Popeye's now.  I heard you talking about Wendy's.  I fucking love Popeye's.  I know.  God damn it.  I've been craving like KFC, like just a bucket of fucking drumsticks. 
[00:16:30]  Imagine just sitting there eating a whole bucket of chicken with that great potatoes  and gravy.  You're a drumstick guy?  You don't go with the white meat?  I'm only thinking of what's easier to hold them.  Muddy both.  For a KFC, though, I don't mind drumstick.  Really?  You would sit there and just drumstick the shit out of it.  When I was a kid, I thought the drumstick was the best part of the chicken.  You get a little older and you could fucking splurge for some of that white meat.  That's true.  And then you're like, what the fuck was I doing eating these drumsticks all these years?  I like peaches fried chicken. 
[00:17:00]  Peaches fried chicken.  Fried it.  Somewhere out in the woods.  Now, chicken wings, I like the drumsticks over the little wings.  There's a scene in Precious where I think it's after.  Monique goes, come here and take care of mom.  Or something like that.  So you know she wins and eats her mom's box.  Where she walks into this place and she steals a 10-piece bucket of chicken.  And then you show her running with it down the street and then eating it.  And it's really good, though, because she sits down in this place.  She's sucking the grease off her fingers.  And then she sits down.  And then she just jumps up and throws up into a garbage can. 
[00:17:30]  But it makes you feel some kind of empathy for her.  You're like, wow, man, that's why she's a big fatso.  She's trying to cover up all this horribleness.  But you see, the girl that plays Precious, that's not acting.  Yeah, that's true.  You know what I mean?  She is huge.  She knows how to eat a bucket of chicken and throw up afterwards.  Of course she does.  Fatty.  Oh, great.  I think we're losing the phones again.  Link to servers down.  Oh, no.  Dan, we still have you, though?  Dan the man.  I don't think so.  Dan.  That's all right.  What a surprise.  Another day, another problem with something. 
[00:18:00]  And it's not a Mars thing, man.  Nah, I know.  It's not a Mars thing.  It's a system problem.  Automation error.  We just lost all our phones again.  Because the phones have to go to some fucking faraway land and then be rerouted back here  for reasons unknown.  Now it's just a blue screen.  The blue screen of death.  Is that the blue screen of death?  Blue screen of death.  No, that's just the background blue screen.  Keith from Niagara Falls goes, pouring a protein shake over Captain Crunch just doesn't work 
[00:18:30]  out.  Which is true.  Could be what the Iraq is doing.  That's all you had to do?  What did you do?  Just reopened the program.  Come on.  It wasn't that easy.  I had fucking error messages all over the place.  Error.  All right.  Error.  Now, Anthony is pretty upset this morning.  I'm in a dilemma.  I had a great drive-in that ended with just like, ugh.  And then I have a dilemma going on tonight of all nights.  Tonight is the big, I mean, everyone's been waiting for this. 
[00:19:00]  Except me.  Well.  I haven't seen one episode.  Not a one.  You are in the minority, my friend.  I'm trying to be the last person alive to see Lost.  Well, I don't know what that will get you.  Well, after today, my competition is going to be a lot less because a lot of people are  going to give in today.  I know it.  Because don't they have like an hour?  I'm guessing the first hour is going to catch people.  The first hour would be a, God, see if I was going to watch.  I should watch today.  Yeah.  But you'll miss out on so much goodness. 
[00:19:30]  Just wait now.  Just wait now.  And then get all the seasons on Netflix, Xbox.  You can do it that way.  I got the first two seasons on.  You should watch it, man.  It's good.  Box or whatever.  You can just do it on Netflix.  Yeah, that's true, too.  It's so fucking easy.  I'm Netflix-ing my ass off.  What a fucking great thing.  It's great.  It's fucking fantastic.  Right through the PS3.  I was watching old Alfred Hitchcock Presents last night and old Quincy's.  Oh, you finally got some Quincy's in?  Dude, they have like every season of Quincy up there. 
[00:20:00]  Any episodes we should be doing on our show?  Every episode is gold.  It is such, such shit.  Last night's episode was, Quincy, obviously, was helping out with the kids in the urban neighborhood, Opie.  There was a drive-by shooting.  Could you tell the guys which episode that one we could do on the show?  This one was called Baby Rattlesnakes. 
[00:20:30]  Baby Rattlesnakes?  Because they're little kids in the city, but they can grow up and become rattlesnakes.  The little venom from a baby rattlesnake is just as harmful as a big one.  Pretty fucking annoying.  That's the analogy they were making.  All right, good.  And so Quincy has to do an autopsy because there's a drive-by, and the window rolls down.  There's two of the brothers walking down the street.  The shotgun blasts, and then you see a mother in a front yard look at the little baby pool  that the little seven-year-old girl was in, and it's like full of shotgun shells and leaking 
[00:21:00]  water, and she's just like, oh!  So then they show Quincy and his homoerotic Asian partner, Sam, in the little coroner's  office there, his little room, and he's ready to do the autopsy, and he's just Quincy.  He's just, yeah, yeah, we'll do this.  And then he pulls the blanket back and goes, oh, it's a young girl.  I was fucking roaring at that point.  It's a young girl. 
[00:21:30]  Girl.  Girl.  I was roaring at that point.  And he starts trying to do the autopsy, and he had to step away.  He couldn't even, like, deal with it.  And he's like, little children killing children.  It was so hokey and pat and just fucking, like, just horrible.  Like, everything was cliche.  Right.  And then they had the parole officer that used to be the gang member, and then they had  the woman, the white woman psychiatrist that just thinks goodness can come out of these 
[00:22:00]  kids and turns Quincy around.  And then there's a politician running for office on this platform that we got to be strong and  send these animals to prison.  And Quincy's like, you know, well, what do you want me to do about it to the psychiatrist?  And they all sit down and talk.  And Quincy talks to the politician, and he's like, well, why don't you find out how they  got this way?  Take a walk in there, moccasins. 
[00:22:30]  Moccasins.  Oh, Jimmy, the douche chill factor was in full effect.  Can I say that nobody asks the coroner how to help kids today?  No!  Never!  And, yeah, that's it.  And the coroner, by the way, Quincy, was giving a press conference.  Oh, the, why?  Hey, and that dude, not him.  Who is that kid?  That guy.  Oh, that kid.  A lot of these people, you recognize.  I know, you recognize him.  That guy was in Barney Miller. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, that's right, okay.  And then this little black kid.  Oh, is this the whole preview for the episode?  Yeah, yeah, look.  Listen to him.  Here, let's go back.  It was the whole preview.  Yeah, yeah, turn him up.  He was great.  Oh, that's the open part.  I like the opening.  Oh, I watched it.  I saw the flatheads.  The big Q.  He's in a sweater vest.  I saw his sweater vest.  The world of forensic medicine. 
[00:23:30]  You are about to enter the most fascinating scene of police work.  What was the twist in the fucking episode, though?  The world of forensic medicine.  Oh, don't blow it.  They turned the kid around.  Oh.  Oh, that's all that is?  Yeah, yeah, of course.  They didn't turn into a gangbanger.  They robbed Quincy's member's only jacket.  And Quincy gave a press conference.  Wait, how did they turn the kid around as he shot the kid?  Hold on, Danny, go back a little bit.  He didn't.  Sorry, just go back.  That's what I mean.  There was a twist.  They accused the kid of.  Right.  Because he's hanging out with the wrong people, so he needs to be straightened out, which  he is by the end of the episode. 
[00:24:00]  And it turns out someone else shot the kid.  Exactly.  Which was, what, an older gangbanger?  And basically saying, see, this is going to happen to you if you stay on the street.  Blah, blah, blah.  Exactly.  Correctamundo.  I'm sorry.  I asked Danny to stop because when Quincy was started, it would be a Q.  And then there'd be three circles with different pictures of Quincy in them.  And just pause it in the next second.  Now the cops are fainting.  He pulls back the sheet.  Yes, yes.  But now here comes the montage of photos.  Wait, stop right there. 
[00:24:30]  I'm trying to look at the fucking awful photos they have of Quincy in action.  Yeah.  In the bottom circle, there's just a hypodermic.  A syringe.  In the top left, it's just a fucking profile of Quincy wearing a collared shirt with a sweater  over it.  And he's laughing.  He's laughing.  But you've got to also bring, they shot it right into the sun so you can barely see Quincy's  face.  But he's like a 56-year-old guy.  Like, no one is thinking this is fun.  And in the other photo, he's wearing a horrible tan jacket, looking off into the distance from 
[00:25:00]  the back.  His members-only jacket.  It's like the fucking, the worst photo montage ever.  It's really horrible.  Isn't that terrible?  Just go slow to the next one, because the next one's going to be equally fucking horrible.  Right there, stop.  All right.  It's a montage.  More photos.  All right.  The right picture is just, I guess, his town that he lives in.  Just the marina.  It's the marina.  It's a little seaside community.  In the left picture on the top, he's getting onto his sailboat. 
[00:25:30]  And he's wearing a white hat and his awful members-only jacket.  He's getting ready to sail.  And the bottom one is great.  He is in a, like, 1965 little dinghy boat.  Yeah.  Just driving on the water and laughing.  It looks like the boat that fucking, that was in the little, the little area in Jaws.  Yeah.  Where the guy got his leg bitten off.  You kids okay over there?  Over there?  Okay, let's see the next three awful photos.  I never noticed.  Oh, that's funny.  He's just touching flat asses.  Feeling up flat asses. 
[00:26:00]  All right, those are just Quincy and Quartz.  Yeah.  I just, I love, he's always in action, Quincy.  Why is the coroner running?  There's a cop car chasing someone.  Quincy's running.  He should be in his office.  We should get Dr. Bodden in one time and ask him how much of this actually happens to coroners.  None.  You don't think Bodden's running across the street?  Never.  After a perp?  Never.  In the episode he gave a press conference.  He had to give a press conference and he's talking and they're asking the coroner, have 
[00:26:30]  they arrested the men charged at this?  And it's like, they have not made an arrest at this time and although one person is in  custody and they are questioning him.  Like the coroner isn't doing this.  Let's play more.  I gotta hear Quincy talk.  Now he's running.  He's always in action, Quincy.  Of course.  Of course.  Oh, shaving with an electric razor.  He's drinking at the bar.  He's on the phone.  He's talking to people.  Here's Flatass.  Yeah. 
[00:27:00]  Fucking boxy ass makes me angry.  I wish that was the Edmund Fitzgerald they were on.  Quincy wouldn't get pussy like that.  No.  It must be a hooker or something.  Oh, boy.  Baby rattlesnakes.  A little Spanish kid.  Oh, Gary Wahlberg is Lieutenant Monaghan.  Lieutenant Monaghan.  And who's Sam?  Sam is, I forget his name.  Robert Ito.  It's Robert Ito.  Is Sam.  That's his kid, right?  Sergeant Brill. 
[00:27:30]  What's that, little man?  Yeah.  At least they used some brothers, though.  Yeah.  Old school brothers.  Old days.  These are old school brothers.  Hey, Sonia.  All right.  It's the whole episode.  Oh, it's the whole episode?  Where's the preview?  Yeah.  We don't need that.  We just need the preview.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Only the preview.  Just the preview is good.  I want you to get cleaned up for dinner.  Okay, Mom.  Another drive-by.  Drive-by.  The little girl that had shooting.  She just died a few minutes ago.  I didn't do it.  Nobody ever did it.  Every kid who comes through claims he was set up. 
[00:28:00]  There ain't no way I'm going to say I did something when I didn't.  Those babies are lethal killers.  You think Kellogg didn't kill that child?  We want to see you make good.  And you know what I see out there?  Committed people doing jobs, working extra long hours for no pay.  Well, maybe you ought to walk a mile in their moccasins.  See, it's all the evil white people that want to, like, do evil things to these criminals.  And then the ethnic people, the Spanish people, the black guys, and Quincy, finally getting turned around, sees goodness in them. 
[00:28:30]  Quincy, the liberal.  It was so horrible, but fantastic.  And he always talks.  Whenever he's making a point, he always talks a little bit like his arm jerks.  Yeah, yeah.  He puts his fingers together and his hand up and moves it back and forth.  I'm making a point.  Why don't you walk a mile in their moccasins?  And his hand moves.  Who the fuck wears moccasins?  No one.  No one. 
[00:29:00]  No one.  Did anyone ever wear moccasins?  He should have said, why don't you run through a field and lose your land in their moccasins?  I will definitely be watching another episode, though, at night.  I got, like, eight seasons that I could just poke through.  You were on a long time, huh?  Yeah.  I figured I'd go with some of the later seasons, like, after they completely ran out of ideas,  which is pretty funny to watch, man.  Sure.  Anyway, it leads to Lost.  That's what we're talking about here.  Lost, so I go down into my basement last night, and I notice... 
[00:29:30]  Excuse me.  Yes?  It's not a basement.  Well, I go to the lower bunker.  It's furnished better than pretty much 99.9% of the houses in America.  Well, it's das Bunker.  Yes.  It's my bunker.  It's a bunker.  I go down there.  An entertainment bunker.  Yeah.  You know, the bar's down there.  And I notice by the theater door that my light switches, there's a few light switches out  there for different levels of lighting and stuff. 
[00:30:00]  There's no lights on the side of the switches, which indicates there's a problem.  So I open the door.  I try to turn the lights on.  Nothing happens.  I go into the control room, and there's two big racks of equipment that run the theater.  The right half is out.  Just blank.  Everything.  No power to anything.  And the left side, the amps are on for the sound, but the top, again, power management  thing, has a big red fault light blinking. 
[00:30:30]  It was like fucking Apollo 13.  I felt like Apollo 13.  There was a problem.  I couldn't fix it.  It wasn't a breaker.  I unplugged it.  I plugged it in.  I did all the fucking stupid shit.  I did all the dumb shit.  I did all the dumb shit.  It's not coming on.  Maybe Con Ed needed to borrow some of your power to light a small town.  Is that what they were doing?  Somewhere out on Long Island.  They better fucking give it back, because there seems to be a problem with my power management  modules. 
[00:31:00]  And this is big, because I had, and have still, because Keith is very optimistic, I have a  lost viewing party in the theater tonight.  I invited people over.  We're going to hang out in the movie theater, watch Lost on the 11-foot screen.  It'd be fucking great.  Where was my invite?  And you don't watch the show.  And it's a weeknight.  With the screen, it's going to be as big as the real island, right? 
[00:31:30]  Jesus.  Actual size, Chip.  Yes, yeah.  Yes, yeah.  So you've got to get this fucking fixed by, what time is it on tonight?  Yeah, it's on early enough.  Now, I called Keith, who knows the guys that installed it and everything like that, and  Keith assured me he will be stopping by today to take a look at it.  Now, Keith's pretty proficient in this home theater stuff, but I'm looking at this last 
[00:32:00]  night, and I wasn't futzing with anything except circuit breakers in the other room and things  like that, and I cannot see how Keith will get this up and running.  And if he can't, I need the people that installed this fucking thing over at my house,  Paranto, with borrowed equipment if you need, and get that thing up and running for tonight.  Wait, is there a reboot?  There's so many different components.  Really?  And power management, and power backup. 
[00:32:30]  Shake some of the wires.  What?  The wires come out of the wall, it's as big as your fucking thigh.  Two big snakes coming out of the wall into all this equipment.  Me and Jimmy will go over there.  We'll just start jiggling things.  Yeah.  Don't jiggle.  You want to go jiggle some stuff?  Fuck it around.  Me and Jimmy will fuck around and jiggle some stuff.  Don't be jiggling anything.  So one of the towers is out?  How do you, like, what do you say, the right side?  A whole rack.  Like, they're rack-mounted components, so I pulled the rack out and looked at the back 
[00:33:00]  and, like, there's nothing back there I know except little reset buttons.  I tried pushing those.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing works.  Everything on that rack, the Xbox, the fucking cable box, the Kaleidoscape, and the controls  for the power for the theater itself.  You know what you could do?  You could sit in the dark theater and move the chairs, recline them back and forth.  That's the only thing that works are the reclining chairs.  Sounds very relaxing.  Have you been in a theater?  For a lost party.  A long time ago, yeah. 
[00:33:30]  Before it was showing movies.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I got to look at a screen.  Just a blank screen.  A blank screen.  Now I need this fixed because I planned on a lost viewing party tonight.  It's a party.  I can't cancel my party.  Wow, your ex is looking really good today.  You think so again?  Let me see.  Oh, yeah, she is.  Looks like she's got some lipo done or something. 
[00:34:00]  You thinking a little lipo?  I don't know.  I heard some rumors.  She's probably an exercise person, though.  How could I have said that worse?  She's probably an exercise person, though.  I know her.  No?  Not really.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  She's doing the traffic right now.  Yeah, I see.  That's nice.  She's got a nice top on right now.  Yeah, yeah.  She knows how to get one of those bras one size too small.  Yeah. 
[00:34:30]  They'll make her cover that up, probably.  By the next...  Yeah, by the next segment.  Yeah, I love how you know all the insides.  Hey, my name's Mike.  Tell Anthony, all he's got to do is bypass that power thing with a regular power strip  and plug it in somewhere.  The power management...  Just bypass it all and plug the shit in.  Bypass the power management and just plug it in.  Ant?  Yeah.  It's all wonderful that Mike has advice for you.  Yeah.  But I think officially the listeners have taken over the show.  Look at the phones. 
[00:35:00]  I see that.  Where is he coming in from?  Where is Mike actually talking from?  Mike!  No button was pushed.  He's not on any screens in front of us.  Jared...  I was expecting to talk to somebody on screen, sorry.  You didn't even talk to...  How did you get through?  This is amazing.  We didn't push the button to take a call.  I'm not even turned toward the phones.  I'm turned toward Ant to listen to what's going on in his world.  And the two phone calls we got is Jared and some other guy.  Yeah, we...  And no phones are down. 
[00:35:30]  No one knows how this happened.  And the weird thing is he calls...  He just takes over the show and he actually has something good for the show.  I know.  He actually...  Thank God.  Mike, where are you calling from?  I'm actually in Kentucky.  I have a cell phone notice from Colorado.  So what is...  All of a sudden you could just get through without us even pushing a button down?  That's an interesting concept for a show.  Could anyone else do this?  All right, everyone at home, try to get on our show. 
[00:36:00]  It's just open phones.  Yeah, just try to get on.  I don't know how this guy did it.  All right, I'll give that advice to Keith and see if he can figure something out.  Now, Mike, you got to do the right thing and hang up because I don't even know where you're calling from.  I don't know how to hang up on you.  All right, he's gone.  Anyone else?  Hello?  Hello?  Anyone out there?  Hello?  Hello, caller?  Hello?  I don't know if that was really the best advice for really high-end theater equipment.  I don't think so either.  You shouldn't bypass the power management. 
[00:36:30]  I would do that.  That's what I would do is plug in a fucking $30,000 projector and have it just on house current.  Well, yeah, I mean, whatever electrical problems are happening currently, just plug in a power strip and then plug all your equipment into that.  Plug it all in, right?  Yeah, why not?  Because obviously there's nothing wrong.  That's what I would do.  No, what you should do is just get a long fucking cord.  Yeah.  Whistle a happy tune.  Mm-hmm.  And then go outside with the long cord and plug it into your neighbor's house. 
[00:37:00]  But that doesn't help the theater.  If you bypass some shit, I don't know.  Oh, I have to do what he said and just bypass everything?  Yeah.  But, you know, plug it into your neighbor's house.  Yeah, that'll work.  Well, the phones are fucked.  I don't know.  Isn't it ironic that the uninterruptible power supply is interrupting your power?  I know.  That's the problem, too.  It's, it's, I have a backup.  It's a total backup where if the power went out in my house, I could still watch movies.  Jared's got your answer, Anthony.  Oh, he does?  Jared in Boston. 
[00:37:30]  I think I could still answer some of the phones and then some of you could just pop into our show.  Yeah, whenever they want.  Jared.  Hey.  Hey.  Am I on?  Yes.  Oh, excellent.  It works.  Uh, Anthony, I know the problem.  Yeah?  The button's on B, not A.  Oh, it's B, not A.  It's always B.  I remember that.  That's not a problem.  Yes.  It's always B.  Yes.  So you got a backup plan for this whole, uh, lost party that me and Jimmy weren't invited  to?  Well, well, look, the backup plan stinks because everybody could do that at home. 
[00:38:00]  You didn't get invited?  It's just watching it.  No, I don't get invited.  It's okay, though.  I got a special invite to my house.  It was monogrammed.  Monogrammed.  Monogrammed.  It was monogrammed.  It had a big Q on it.  It said, there's an autopsy.  Would you like to come watch?  I would be flattered if I was invited.  Obviously, I can't go, but I don't even get invited.  You don't watch Lost.  Did you get invited?  He begged me to come.  Yeah, I figured as much.  You don't watch Lost.  He likes you better.  Oh, my God. 
[00:38:30]  And your flux capacitator.  Capacitator?  Dammit.  Ray in Kalamazoo.  Ray?  Hey, oh, somebody can't spell.  Your flux capacitor is bad.  It's an easy fix.  That's not an easy fix, sir.  It's not an easy fix.  All you need to do is go out to the DeLorean.  You can switch it out real easy.  Two bolts, and you're done.  I am like, I don't know what to do if this isn't working tonight, because the only alternative  is to watch it upstairs in the living room, and that's a regular TV that everyone has over 
[00:39:00]  their house anyway.  The special part is the theater.  I'll happily let you use mine.  It's only 52 inches, but I've never seen Lost either.  52 inches.  Shove it.  You're not beating me on that.  I'll be the last person alive to see Lost.  I'm stubborn that way.  I hear it's a great show, and I'm just hurting myself in the end.  Great show.  I'm more into the first 48.  I love black people killing black people.  That's awesome. 
[00:39:30]  But that was so sincere when he said that.  It really was, and that's exactly what that show is.  Can I get a paper?  I thought you wanted a woot-woot.  A woot-woot would be good.  Can I get a paper?  Yes.  I want to see what I'm watching tonight.  Oh.  While America watches Lost, I've got to pick my program.  What time is Lost on?  8 o'clock?  8 to 11?  Oh, 8.  God, that's never going to be fixed by 8.  What did Regis say about Lost?  You were laughing about that.  Regis is an idiot.  This morning.  Oh, Anthony.  Regis is just an idiot. 
[00:40:00]  Well, he's all about the pop culture.  I love the pop culture.  He's talking about, they have some celebrities here, like the great, oh, Al Roker.  And Vanna White.  Jack Tapper from ABC News.  Don't know him.  And then Zachary Levy or Olivia, from Chuck, whatever.  And then, of course, they have Regis Philbin.  And they all give their insight and predictions on what they think Lost is all about and what  this last season will bring. 
[00:40:30]  And Regis is just a moron.  He's apparently watched the show from the beginning, yet he picked up on something no one talks about  and no one has talked about and it's just bullshit.  We got it, actually.  Oh, you actually have the quote?  Yeah.  Not the exact quote.  Oh, okay.  Well, yeah, keep your quote handy.  Yeah, yeah, we'll see what Regis has to say on Lost.  By the way, hold on, because I don't want to lose this guy because our phones are all fucked up.  Pat in Staten Island.  Go ahead, Pat. 
[00:41:00]  Pat.  Pat.  You're on the air?  Pat.  Pat.  Hey, if Steve Blatter's listening, I give you two days before I go old school.  Oh, with the sledgehammer?  It knows old school and it's not pretty.  Two days to figure out this phone.  I mean, we got great calls and it's fucking up our whole first segment here.  For real.  Reboot.  For real.  We need a reboot.  Here's what Regis has to say about Lost.  Old school, Ant. 
[00:41:30]  Two days.  Great.  Old school.  A couple years ago, listen, Matthew, a couple years ago I saw the shadow of an animal that looked like a huge dinosaur.  Were you, like, freeze-framing it?  No, I wasn't.  You might have seen something that nobody else saw.  You're absolutely right.  And you want to know something that could be smart for those producers and writers to write in a dinosaur now and make me look.  He's an idiot.  He goes, I saw a dinosaur in the background. 
[00:42:00]  And at a time when people on Lost were being killed off by an unknown monster or disease.  It was my theory that there's a dinosaur on this deserted island.  First of all, it wasn't a deserted island.  And he's helping himself to these people.  I'm standing by my dinosaur theory.  Maybe I'm crazy, but the whole thing makes sense to me.  Well, of course it does, Regis. 
[00:42:30]  He thinks it's going to turn into Land of the Lost and be a dinosaur show.  It's more likely that the Dharma Initiative was actually a shit hat factory.  I hope it is.  That's the worst synopsis I've ever heard.  That's a spoiler, Jimmy.  A shit hat factory.  That's what the whole thing was put there for, was to make shit hats and allow them to harden in the sun like clay. 
[00:43:00]  Here's part two of the Regis quote.  Hey, do me a favor.  Tell me the truth.  What is killing all the people on the island?  You don't care.  What do you care?  You're on another series, another network.  Is it a dinosaur or not?  It's the flu.  The flu?  I keep seeing a shadow of a dinosaur that really...  Enough about the dinosaur.  And Regis has to blow his doze.  He has gotten more nasal over the years.  Now it's crazy.  He's pushing 80.  My God.  It's all the cocaine. 
[00:43:30]  While you have your Lost Party, I'm going to go to A-Max.  And I'm going to watch 10,000 B.C.  Oh, wow.  There you go.  That's pretty good.  That's like a...  Yeah.  Or I could watch Are You Smarter Than...  Who the fuck watches that?  Oh, by the way.  You know what I did last night?  What?  As a goof.  Two and a half men.  Oh, you watched it?  As a goof, I watched Two and a Half Men.  The whole episode.  It's horrendous.  Horrid, right?  But they talk about boners and erections and stuff.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:44:00]  When did that start happening on sitcom TV?  That's like their excuse why people say, oh, it's so funny because they're watching and  they're hearing people say boners and shit like that.  And after every scene, they have some kind of, I mean, there's somebody in our audience  watches this show.  It's some kind of jingle that goes, men.  Ew.  It drives you fucking nuts.  No way.  I think it just goes, men, and then goes to the next scene.  After every scene, it does it, though.  That's unbearable.  Dude, this show is horrendous. 
[00:44:30]  That is unbearable.  The machine is unpredictable.  Oh, he's crazy.  He's a wild, man.  He's a wild, wild man.  You got to look out for him.  He's a loose cannon.  And then my brother trying to get me into that damn sitcom that comes on after that.  The nerdy one.  The help me out.  Big Bang Theory.  Big Bang Theory.  You watch that, Travis?  You are talking about something I've never heard of.  Big Bang Theory, I guess, was seeing people that came up with Two and a Half Men.  Oh, of course.  From the producers of Two and a Half Men. 
[00:45:00]  My brother, Scott, who's the star of the Hornet Nest video I did, he loves this fucking show,  and he wants me to watch.  I can't get into that either, because it's the sitcom formula, the basic formula.  What happened to the Hornet's Nest?  It's just hibernating.  It's still there.  We could take a shovel and get it out of the attic within seconds.  How do you live with a monster in your house?  I have no idea how people could live with a monster in there.  That is a monster.  But this is how stupid we are.  We figured we'd wait until spring.  Oh, yeah, when it thaws out.  Yeah, when there's more action in the nest. 
[00:45:30]  There's nothing happening in that nest right now.  You don't want action.  You really shouldn't, because you don't know how far it goes.  Well, these guys are begging for a follow-up video, so if we're making a follow-up video,  my family's smart enough to know that we should do it when there's some action.  Tragedy caught on video today.  Yes.  Yeah.  Greg Opie Hughes goes to kick a hornet's nest and falls halfway in and is caught from the waist.  Oh, shit.  And is stung about his penis and anus and face.  For four hours.  Four hours straight.  While his co-workers point and laugh and try to throw water on him. 
[00:46:00]  Ah, shit.  Yeah, Big Bang Theory.  I don't know.  My brother loves the fucking show.  I tried.  They're too nerdy and too, like, too, too, too.  It's like the number one comedy on TV.  Yeah, I understand, Travis.  Fucking A.  I don't get it.  I do understand.  I'm not saying it.  I'm not filling it, yo.  You watch it, Travis?  I didn't hear you.  I'm sorry.  No, I don't.  I just know that it's very popular with everyone else.  Two and a half men is huge.  Two and a half men is.  No, Big Bang Theory.  A Big Bang is bigger than Two and a Half Men now?  Yeah, it's the number one comedy, yeah.  And I guess the kid in Two and a Half Men is now an adult or something? 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Or do they switch the kid out?  No, I don't think so.  No, it's the same kid.  Holy shit, he's like a fucking 17-year-old or something.  He's an old dude now.  Yeah.  What happened?  Three men.  It's now three men.  Let's call it three men.  So you got to figure out the lost thing, yeah.  Yeah, I got to figure that shit out.  And then I just quickly had another, like, fucking ick this morning.  And, of course, it involves cabs, cabbies. 
[00:47:00]  I fucking despise the cab drivers.  I do, too.  Yeah, and I see those yellow fucking shitmobiles rolling around.  And now they're just running like animals on the streets trying to pick up fares because  it's gotten so expensive to take a cab that there's not as many people out there, especially  early in the morning.  Well, these guys...  You guys almost get hit this morning.  Yeah, but, I mean, if I tell a story, I'm sick of telling my near-miss stories on the 
[00:47:30]  show because then Kenny comes in and he's a fucking robot, doesn't back up anything.  He's like, it was no big deal.  As we're slamming on the fucking brakes this morning and missing the cab in front of us  by two inches.  But Kenny will tell a different story if he came in here.  Oh, that was nothing.  Did he honk?  Did Kenny beat?  No, he didn't fucking honk.  I would have got out of the car.  He refused to honk.  I would have got out of the car and, trust me, I'm not a tough guy, but I would have taken  my chances.  Because this guy, it was close.  Just like Anthony said...  He waved over to get a fare. 
[00:48:00]  Two lanes.  Two lanes.  What this stupid city's doing, and I'm with Anthony, I don't like cab drivers in general,  but it's a deeper issue.  But this dumb city, they're making it really hard for these cab guys to make their living,  right?  And there's more and more accidents.  And so these dummies in City Hall or wherever the fuck, wherever the fuck this comes from,  who knows, they decided, well, the reason there's more incidents is because these guys  are on their Bluetooth.  That's not what's happening.  They're so desperate to make their money for their shift that as soon as they see a person 
[00:48:30]  with a hand up, all hell breaks loose.  Because there's like three cabs next to each other, and now it's a death race.  Yeah, because they're in desperation to get fares.  That's what's really happening.  But the dumb politicians and everybody else, they don't see the big picture ever.  They go, oh, it has to be that they're on Bluetooth.  No one gets in accidents if you're on a Bluetooth.  I'm sorry.  It just doesn't happen.  No.  So this morning, like, we're flying down 7th Avenue, and this cab jams on the brakes, 
[00:49:00]  goes over like two lanes.  We miss it by an inch.  And he didn't slam on the horn.  No.  And if he told a story, I'm telling you, he'll tell a different story.  Oh, there's no big deal.  Why didn't he beep?  That fucking annoys me so much.  He won't beep.  No.  Because he doesn't want to wear out his fucking horn.  But anyway.  They don't do anything.  And you had a cab incident today, too.  Yeah, so, and they do, the problem is they do this shit constantly.  I have a wonderful, you know, drive in, like I do every day, dealing with the cabs and 
[00:49:30]  everything else.  And I pull in front of the building, and it's very crowded in front of the building today,  this morning.  There's one spot open for me to do my magnificent job of parallel parking my Escalade, which I  do very well.  The sensors and the fucking cameras and all that shit.  It doesn't matter.  Dude, I swing it in like a fucking champ.  Yeah.  And I'm miraculous.  But you know what the cab will do?  He's letting out a fare.  Now, instead of pulling next to where there's no fucking parking space, he could pull anywhere 
[00:50:00]  on that line of cars and let his fare out, as long as he's away from the cars enough where  the door doesn't hit the car, which still leaves plenty of room for cars to get by on  his right-hand side.  He pulls, not into the parking space, which wouldn't even piss me off as much, but he  pulls in front of and blocks the parking space, the only one left, to let his fare out.  Why?  Why take up that fucking parking space? 
[00:50:30]  Because they're selfish scumbags.  No thought about anything else going on on the road.  I got out, and Kenny's walking up to me, and I just start yelling.  I go, you fucking savage.  I go, why did you pull where there's already a fucking car?  Yeah.  Well, they do that in the middle of Broadway.  You know, Broadway's not a busy avenue here in Manhattan.  They'll stop right in the middle of one of the lanes to let people out.  They stop in the middle of the lane.  They don't even pull over.  What did they say when you said that to them? 
[00:51:00]  His window was up.  You couldn't hear me.  Hey, Kenny's in the studio.  Kenny, what happened this morning to us?  I want your side of this.  I'm annoyed.  That is enraging.  That's such fucking pieces of shit.  It's like, just fucking pull up so you're not blocking the only parallel parking spot  left in front of the building.  Why does he feel he's got to let the guy out there?  There's a fucking total lack of consideration by every cabbie out there.  They're all fuckos.  And they hate when you beat with them.  They hate. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, yeah.  And I'm fucking Harry Horn.  I lay on the fucking horn until it actually goes like...  And I got enough dings and dents in my Escalade now after having it for almost about three  years where I don't give a flying fuck anymore.  And if there's a cab bumper to bumper, like won't let me in, I will cut in on that motherfucker.  I don't care if I hit him.  I don't give a shit.  I'll bang right into him and he'll stop and wave his hands around and I'll just flip in  the bird in the mirror. 
[00:52:00]  But you...  Fuck you!  But it took you three years to get to that point.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  You have to do what I do.  I got my new car last February.  I took a hammer and I fucking dinged it.  Yeah, you dinged it.  And then it doesn't matter anymore.  Nah, I like battle wounds.  Not a ding where you're going to be depressed like, oh, why did I do that?  Just a couple little shots.  The first...  On the side fucking bumpers.  The first fuck up I got on my Escalade was a truck was blocking the entire roadway.  Yeah.  So I got up on the sidewalk and started going.  And before my electric mirrors pulled in, it hit a telephone pole. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, shit.  But just skimmed it and left like some wood and tar and stuff on it.  So I was like, all right.  Battle wagon.  I'm good now.  It's battle wagon time.  See, you're lucky you don't have to park in New York City.  I don't anymore, thank God, because where I decided to live, I got a garage.  But before that, I had the parallel parking.  Yeah.  You come out and see the most unusual dents in your car and you're like, how the fuck did  this happen?  Oh, so you know.  Oh, yeah.  The hood of my old car has marks from, I guess, a toolbox or tools that's falling on top of it. 
[00:53:00]  People just put shit.  They'll take shit out of their trunk and put it on your hood while they're just fucking,  you know, like metal thing.  It doesn't matter.  Wire brush.  I'm a wire brush salesman.  Here's all my merchandise.  Let me pile it on his hood.  Just put it on your fucking hood.  You fucking asshole.  Hey, Kenny's in here.  Kenny, we had another near miss.  This would be the third.  We've been in one accident.  Here's the sheet so far with me and Kenny.  And Kenny's a great driver.  He really is.  We've been in a nice T-bone accident. 
[00:53:30]  That was pretty impressive.  Kenny's a great get close and stop and make you nauseous every time.  Does he do that?  Yes.  We had a cop that was flying through the red light, stopped at the last second that I  eyeballed and Kenny didn't think was the smart thing to do, but I was fucking pissed because  I would have taken the impact on that one.  He'll win.  And then this morning we had what, Kenny?  No, there was another near miss at Columbus Circle.  Remember when Jimmy was in the truck?  Which one?  Going home one day, not coming in.  Oh, fuck.  I missed fucking filming it by seconds where you were in a complete panic, Kenny. 
[00:54:00]  Because Jimmy's yelling at you.  I'm yelling at you.  He won't fucking beep.  Why won't you beep your horn, Kenny, when there's danger?  It's rude.  No, but if there's danger, it's supposed to alert somebody that you're there.  No, it's rude.  It's, but it's, it's part of the vehicle's safety system.  Nah, it's to like to say hello.  It's not to like.  It's not.  It's part of his OCD.  He won't beep.  He's saving the horn. 
[00:54:30]  Save the horn.  He takes the horn out and he actually just holds it at night.  All those beeps you have left.  It really is part of his OCD.  I know it is.  I actually, you don't know how many times I've leaned over and said, pardon me.  Flah!  With my left hand.  And his horn actually goes, what was that?  Oh, you're pushing me.  I should make a noise.  You know, Kenny goes home and he's all depressed.  That's like a year's worth of fucking beeping that you do with that one long.  Oh, he refuses to beep.  So what happened this morning?  I want to hear it in Kenny's.  I apologize to the horn.  I want to hear it in your words.  What happened this morning? 
[00:55:00]  No, well, when we go in the morning, we got to time the lights just right.  You get stuck at one, you get stuck at every one.  It's a two minute drive or like a ten minute drive, depending on if you miss one fucking  life.  A ten minutes before, people go, ah, what's ten minutes before?  Nah, it's big.  Yeah, when you're trying to do a morning show, ten minutes is huge.  Yeah.  And then, you know, you got that occasional cocksucker that's just wandering through the  streets, just going slow, blocking everything.  They have nowhere to go or be? 
[00:55:30]  What the fuck?  Get out of the way.  Yeah, so we're cruising down 7th Avenue this morning.  You know, we got all the green lights.  It's a clear shot.  And then all of a sudden, somebody steps out on the corner and puts their arm up to hail  a cab.  And here comes the cab driver across three lanes of traffic right in front of us.  Not even looking if somebody is in his way.  No, to care less.  Yeah, it was close.  We would have been all right.  I am so alert and coordinated.  At that hour of the morning, too. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  How did you not just let, like, literally, you should have assaulted them with that horn.  That would annoy the cab.  He's so fucking, and it would annoy the fucking, uh.  That's when I fucking rolled, I stop and roll the window down and start having a discussion.  And I would say, I go, he just almost killed me, by the way.  Don't get, I would talk to the fair.  Don't get in his cab.  I recognize him as a murderer I saw in the post office.  He kills people.  That's what I would say.  I would make him lose the fucking fair. 
[00:56:30]  You're a lunatic.  I would make him lose the fucking fair.  Fuck him in the ass.  You're a lunatic.  I love it.  You gotta discipline people.  Like, that's a scumbag move.  Yeah.  It was a close, it was a near miss today.  We had a nice near miss.  I didn't want to upset GH anymore.  He was only up for 10 minutes at that point.  I had to tell Kenny.  I go, wow, he slept right to my alarm this morning.  I've been up 10 minutes, you know, knowing that Kenny's probably been up an hour because  he has to come from Jersey.  Does Kenny carry you out to the car like a father when one of the kids fall asleep at 
[00:57:00]  like a party?  I walk in.  And you gotta carry him out to the vehicle?  I walk out of my building some days like a zombie.  I don't even know where I am.  Some days.  I'm a zombie every fucking morning.  The other thing that I think I gave Kenny almost a coronary fucking, and it's Charlie  Sheen, I know that.  I guess I said Sheen, and people just have to catch their fucking minds over the dumbest  things on the show.  But I go to Kenny, you know, Kenny, I got an idea where I can maybe save 10 minutes and 
[00:57:30]  sleep another 10 minutes.  I want to brush my teeth in your car.  He almost lost his fucking mind.  He could not.  No.  I go, look, here's the idea.  I got plastic cups with some fresh water, and I get my electric toothbrush, and I'm  going to brush my teeth, because that takes up the most time every morning, brushing your  stupid teeth.  You gotta give it like three or four minutes, right?  Yeah.  So I'm like, I'll do it in your car.  That means I can sleep another three or four minutes.  The look on his face of panic that I might actually do this. 
[00:58:00]  I thought you were going to drip fucking morning breath saliva all over his fucking seats.  God damn.  And his tan rug.  There'll be a little flecks of toothpaste on his windshield.  I was going to say, just because it's an electric toothbrush, you know, that shit's  going to go everywhere.  You know, you get that like on your mirror.  Sometimes you look, and it's like a little flecks of toothpaste.  Well, I told you, you armor all the entire car, because that guy from the garage got a little  grease on his driver's seat.  Oh, you make a turn, and you're sliding all over the place.  Yes.  There's nothing worse than armor all the leather seats. 
[00:58:30]  You fucking go to get in, and you slide to the other door.  Well, I got in the morning after he did that, and I went, whoop, right up to the floor.  So you don't want me doing the toothbrush thing?  Can we at least try it?  I just want to make it nice for you, Gage.  Were you all right with the egg sandwich eating yesterday?  What'd you do after you got home?  You inspected the car to make sure everything was nice?  No, it was, you know, cordoned off and, you know, decontaminated.  I had a nice egg sandwich yesterday while he was driving, and I think that really freaked 
[00:59:00]  him out.  What goes on in your head as someone's eating an egg sandwich?  Jimmy eats all the time in the car.  I do.  I always eat sandwiches.  And he purposely leaves the garbage all over the place.  Yeah.  I'll, like, leave the, I'll crumble up the wrapper and just put it on the floor.  Oh, he's got a fucking.  Half a coffee cup in there with coffee in it.  Oh, no.  As I'm closing the door.  Now, get it, bitch.  What an asshole you are.  That's awesome, though.  Poor Kenny.  He's just trying to keep a nice vehicle. 
[00:59:30]  Nice.  Yes.  This is beyond nice.  It's uncomfortable because you feel like you can't do anything in his car.  That's Kenny.  He's very proud of his new vehicle, and you guys are very mean to him.  It's showroom quality.  Yes.  It really is.  Good for resale value.  You've had it almost a year, and it looks like it's a brand.  That long?  April.  Oh, April.  Wow.  Yeah, it looks brand new right off the lot.  Let's go.  If I was taller, I would fucking box cutter his seats.  If I was just a much bigger man who could fight. 
[01:00:00]  You should go in with just pens in your back pocket.  Yeah.  And just sit down, and when you get up, it's just got pen all over the seat.  I'm actually making razor pants, so I can put little razors in the back, so I can sit down  and like, oh, sorry.  Hey, so I'm going to suggest, and Brian and Philly, you brush your teeth before you go to  bed, which I do do, and then all you have to do is rinse with mouthwash in the morning.  Does that work, you think?  No.  It doesn't, right?  No.  Well, bacteria builds up and starts the body process.  Yeah, Brian's got gingivitis. 
[01:00:30]  You get that, yeah, morning breathy thing.  This guy...  And don't...  You know something?  For anybody making a suggestion, I saw one guy making a suggestion about my home theater  saying, you've got to hold the reset buttons down for five seconds.  You can't just hit him, asshole.  Do you think I didn't hold the goddamn reset buttons down?  Did you honestly think that?  How you're acting.  Am I a retard?  How you're acting.  I'm thinking maybe you didn't do the most obvious thing.  Look, if someone's at my house right now, wouldn't I say, could you hold the reset buttons 
[01:01:00]  down for five...  Why don't you just power down your entire house and see what happens?  Russ in Kansas City.  Russ?  Yeah, listen.  One thing that gets people's attention, I'm a truck driver, get some freight train horns  on your vehicles.  That'll definitely get that.  Is that legal, Ant?  Probably not.  Those are great.  You have those?  Big fucking truck horns.  Yeah, how do you pump up your...  They're legal.  How do you pump up your horn noise, for real?  My new car... 
[01:01:30]  Amplifier.  Who else has a newer vehicle?  Because I noticed something about the newer cars.  They're making it harder to beep your horn.  Am I the only one?  On this?  My fucking horn.  I always get obnoxious horn cars.  Good God, look what she's wearing today.  Are you fucking kidding me?  The Escalade has a great horn.  I love my fucking horn.  That's good for you, Jimmy.  We're looking at a nice ass right now.  An ace.  I have a BMW, and they have really good horns.  The backup camera, not so good.  Horns good.  Why is your backup camera not so good?  The quality is not good, and I'm having problems with BMW in Manhattan. 
[01:02:00]  They're fucking...  They're the worst.  The Escalade, great backup camera.  Sometimes you've got to get out there, though, and give it a...  I dig that.  You know, you've got to clean that bitch off.  Very clear.  Mine is so fucking...  I'll show you a photo I took of the camera at one point.  It's horrible.  Who did that?  Was that...  Who fucking was taking a piss, and then just stood there?  Was that you, Danny?  And just stood there with your dick hanging out in the mirror, in the camera?  I recall something about that, where I was behind Anne's vehicle for some reason, with 
[01:02:30]  parts out, and I think Keith shifted into reverse, so the camera would turn.  Oh, Keith, right, yeah.  So the camera would turn.  Holy shit, that's a brilliant fucking idea.  That's a fucking good idea.  Just standing with your dick right in the fucking camera.  How unclear is this?  You go to a fucking...  Oh, God damn it, Danny.  Is it a duty picture?  No.  No.  It's me holding my penis.  Jesus Christ.  What an ass.  No, my stupid...  I don't know if it's just me, but the horn on my new vehicle is a pain in the ass to fucking 
[01:03:00]  push.  It's one big, solid piece of plastic, and you've got to hit it just right.  Right in the middle?  Yeah.  My horn is like...  What am I holding up?  Like this big.  Yeah.  Kind of like a two-inch by three-inch piece of plastic that's really hard.  But why is that bad?  Because I know when they were putting the horns like on the little nubs, they were like two  little nubs on your steering wheel.  That's a great idea.  Worst time ever.  Why?  No, because you can never hit it.  If you're turning and trying to beep, you don't know where the nubs are. 
[01:03:30]  You want it right in the middle.  Wham!  Yeah, this is a tough push.  It really is.  Wow.  I don't know why, but it is.  Wait, you have the little horns?  No, it's a big, it's a solid piece of plastic.  Hard plastic.  Yeah.  And it's a big piece.  In the middle, yeah.  And you've got to push it just right and hard.  The old school, you just kind of tap it with your fucking palm and you're horning away.  Horning away?  You're just horning away.  All right, the phones are lit, but we really have to take a break.  We went way too long.  I got to, um, I got to, uh, make me leave. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, thank you.  Acid Rain.  Hope you have a Jeep.  They all have weak horns.  You could get it upgraded.  I didn't know that.  Really?  I'm upgrading that motherfucker.  I knew it wasn't just me.  They fixed the Toyotas or are people fucking accelerating?  Yeah, they got a shim.  They came up with a shim, a square piece of metal about the size of a postage stamp that,  uh, cuts down on the friction on the gas pedal because people were losing their fucking,  uh, shit, stepping on the gas and the pedal would stick.  Like, but now I guess the install is about a half hour and they have, like, millions of 
[01:04:30]  cars to do this to.  Jesus.  So good luck there, Toyota.  A shim.  Well, we've all gotten help from a shim, haven't we?  Yeah, I thought that too.  It's like, it's going to be fixed by a shim.  I just picked you some shim in there.  A shim.  Hi, big dick dad.  Are you speeding up too much?  Fixing your gas pedal.  We got some great phone calls, but we definitely have to take a break.  And to the guys down the hall, we got a Nick Cannon alert, uh, on Twitter, I just  got a tweet from uncle, underscore, and then the word Paul, obviously. 
[01:05:00]  Uh, give him a little credit.  He writes, uh, breaking news from Nick Cannon.  Ready for this, Ant?  Oh, please.  You could swallow gum and it won't stay inside you.  And you could drink Pop Rocks and Coke and not die.  Does he have that guy on that we had with the book, The Doctor, about medical myths?  Oh, wow.  Because that was in there.  Maybe.  Maybe his, uh, his talent, uh, his coach has turned him on to some, uh, literature that  is, uh, very good for radio.  Yeah, spell myths. 
[01:05:30]  Want to do a little talent coach bit today?  Love the talent coach.  Jimmy wasn't here for our talent coach bit.  Love the talent coach.  They suggest bits and stuff, and it's good.  It's good.  I think we did a great job with the children.  That was, uh, you want to go children again today?  The children segment was, uh, great.  There's nothing funnier than having a kid on the phone and making him, uh, call his mom  the C-bomb and say shit.  Yeah.  Did you do that?  Oh, of course.  Excellent.  It was fantastic.  You want to talk to Nicole today about, uh, no. 
[01:06:00]  No, I'm just going.  I got to take a piss.  Your son.  We got to take Leakies.  Leakies and then more radio.  Yes.  Stay there.  Uh, oh.  No, we don't have time.  I was going to play a little sound.  Fuck it.  We'll do it later.  O.P. and Anthony, stay there.  Clever, Travis.  Clever.  Well, I bet no one's doing this.  Clever.  Is this on the Hot Topics?  B.  On the talent couch?  Um.  Talent coach, couch.  Why?  Talent couch.  That's different.  The talent couch is very different. 
[01:06:30]  We should start a new bit.  The fuck up of the day.  In the running is talent couch.  Talent couch.  And Charlie Sheehan.  Or Sheehan.  Or whatever the fuck is that.  I don't know.  Uh, no, it's not on the, uh, this song or Groundhog Day.  Or Groundhog Day, right?  Yeah, Groundhog Day is on the big Hot Topics for the week.  Ground Hag Day.  From the talent coach that Nick Cannon is using here in New York City.  Yes.  Because, uh, don't want to bore you guys with the same old shit, but there are people that 
[01:07:00]  are hearing this for the first time.  You gotta believe that and understand that when you get frustrated.  Yeah, lighten up.  Uh, our old seat was taken over by Nick Cannon as far as regular radio goes.  And our old company, uh, hired this guy thinking he could do radio.  Not even checking if he could.  He's in his, uh, in his, uh, seat for a week and they realize, holy shit, he doesn't know  how to fucking do radio and they had to hire a talent coach.  How he's awful.  And the talent coach hands Nick Cannon a, uh, Hot Topics for the week sheet. 
[01:07:30]  And, uh, and suggestive bits.  Yeah, yeah.  See, this is, uh, this is a piece of cake now.  So now you just go into work and, uh, someone's done all the work for you.  Yeah.  Done all the work.  You just gotta sit back now and, uh, pretty much just work off the sheets.  Yeah.  Like dittos.  Yeah.  Hot Topics.  Hot Topics.  Uh, Grammys. 
[01:08:00]  Wait, we're just doing it?  You're not gonna have the listeners try to figure out the Hot Topics of the day?  Oh, like last time?  Yeah, serious Hot Topics only.  Yeah, I'm sure they'll figure it out.  They're not smart enough to come up with the Hot Topics from the talent coach.  I'm telling you right now, Anthony.  Uh, hold on a second.  We got Larry King, uh, checking in.  Larry!  Hey, Anthony.  How important is the energy management module?  Oh, apparently very.  I better get an answer pronto.  Lickety split. 
[01:08:30]  You're not gonna have your lost party tonight.  Hey, Maresca.  Get over there and fix my fucking theater.  Sure.  I hope the lost party is interrupted by this.  You suck.  When, though?  You gotta let the show establish it.  Hour and 11 minutes into it.  That's about right.  Where it's too late, no one could run back to their houses.  No, you know what I will do?  You know what I will do?  If the theater does get up and running, and I am running lost, it will be running upstairs  also.  Just in case.  Just in case.  And then I could rewind and start where it had petered out. 
[01:09:00]  I will have multiple backup plans.  Perhaps you missed my implication.  The ffff was the cable box.  Go ahead, sir.  You're just chiming and talking and more of a fucking bit.  Go ahead, it's all about you.  Go ahead, sir, you.  It's funny every time.  Go ahead, sir.  He's gone.  Where'd he go?  Oh, now he's gone.  I hope he didn't mean to hang up, but I hope a fucking, a semi plowed into the side of his 
[01:09:30]  car, and that's why I was finally disconnected.  What motivates you when someone is setting something up to go, hey, Anthony?  In the middle of Jimmy setting something, and it's obviously setting something up.  He just decides to chime in, because what he has to say is very important.  That's right.  Of galactic import.  Jimmy's basically saying that he hopes the whole neighborhood loses power.  Because it's cable.  Right, right.  So you can't even go to your neighbor's house, which you would hate to do, but in this situation,  you're so desperate, you would knock on your neighbor's door and say, please let me watch 
[01:10:00]  Lost.  Can I watch Lost, please?  So we're kind of hoping the whole community goes down.  And that's because you didn't give me and Jimmy the big invite.  All we want is to be loved a little bit, Anthony, from you.  Just a little love.  I know you got your people that you hang out with, and I know you know that I probably  won't make it just because I don't watch Lost and it's a long ride.  But just knowing that you're thinking of me and Jimmy would be very nice.  I said open invite.  No, we're not accepting the open invite excuse anymore.  I got a text, an email, an engraved, monogrammed invitation delivered to my house. 
[01:10:30]  Request by Mr. Kumia that you be there.  Now, I get a passing mention.  Hey, Lost Party.  As he was walking by in the hall.  Hey, by the Lost Party.  Yeah, me and Jimmy are basically saying we don't want to have to, like, decipher your code and your subtle hints.  Like, I go to, were we invited?  I'm not really sure.  He kind of gave a nod and stuff.  I'm not sure.  Is that an official invite? 
[01:11:00]  I heard him inviting Danny, and then I happened to be there.  He goes, oh, yeah, the Lost Party.  I was like, I think he might have invited us.  I'm not really sure.  There was some vague tweet he did.  I think he was talking to me.  I don't know.  I ain't even, I ain't even dressed for a party.  He didn't say nothing about you.  He didn't say nothing about you.  It's like fucking in Midnight Cowboy.  Anthony's going into diners with his fucking creepy friend, just handing out flyers. 
[01:11:30]  Inviting them to his awful party.  Awful party.  Where fucking Rich Voss is going to steal bologna off the table.  I don't think I've ever seen Midnight Cowboy, now that I think about it.  Wow.  Yeah, that's a good one.  But sometimes I'll see an old movie and go, oh, yeah, I did see this a long time ago.  That's a fucking work of art.  I really don't know.  Midnight Cowboy is so good.  All right.  All right.  I got my Netflix.  One of my favorites ever.  I'm going to rock.  Really?  Only X films ever won the Oscar.  One best picture.  I like watching people's favorite films of all time.  That's in my top five.  I watched, what was the stupid magic movie? 
[01:12:00]  Because Danny, it's one of Danny's favorites.  Oh, it's one of mine, too.  I love that movie.  The Prestige.  The Prestige.  And what was the other one?  The Illusionist.  That's right.  I never saw it.  But The Prestige was much better.  I don't know.  The Illusionist was pretty good, too, though.  Yeah?  I kind of liked it.  But I think you're right.  I think The Prestige was better.  Prestige had a cool twist.  But because of Danny, I go, okay, that's one of his favorite movies of all time.  I'm going to check it out.  And now, because of you, Jimmy, I'm going to check out one of your favorite movies of  all time.  I mean, I'm a cowboy.  It was rated X, too.  There's a little bit of nudity.  It's just, you know, back in 1968 or 69 that you didn't really see that. 
[01:12:30]  Why the fuck would they release an X-rated movie that is such a brilliant film?  Because I've read about the film over the years.  It was just the rating system they gave because it was like tits.  It was really...  How many fucking people could possibly go see the movie, then?  My word.  That's why they don't do a lot of R-rateds.  I don't know how long the X rating actually lasted on it.  I don't know exactly how that worked.  But it won the Oscar.  And it was fucking Hoffman's, I think, his best thing and Voight's best thing.  Fuck.  Yeah, it was good.  All right, where were we?  Talent coach. 
[01:13:00]  Talent coach.  Groundhog Day.  We got the audio.  Oh.  So what do you want to do?  Well, it's Groundhog Day.  You want to do the ground...  Well, Sam was here because he was going to give us a little behind...  Oh, was he?  He's been monitoring the TV.  Now, which Groundhog are we going with this year?  I want to hear all three.  No, we got to go with Punxsutawney Phil.  He's the king of the Groundhogs, right?  Who, who?  But locally, we got Staten Island Chuck.  Staten Island Chuck.  Now, he's the one that bit the mayor.  And I see the mayor's got some heavy-duty fucking construction gloves on. 
[01:13:30]  What a pussy our mayor is.  Get right in there with your bare hands.  I don't care if the damn thing bit you last year.  And then Jersey's got one.  His name is Ed.  And I don't know if he's in Edison.  Edison Ed?  Edison Ed.  No, it's Glory Hold Jim.  He comes out.  If a cock goes in his mouth, we're going to have more winter.  Yeah, six more weeks of high taxes.  Can I talk about our cocksucker faithful listeners?  Sure.  Kevin from Connecticut is the king of them.  Hello.  He writes, my favorite movie is Chud. 
[01:14:00]  Enjoy it.  Chud?  I'm not, I know where you're going with this.  Chud?  He's making a, you know, he wants me to see a lousy movie.  Movie's horrible.  Well, that's why he wrote it.  Carnivorous Underground.  That's why he wrote that, though.  He's tricking me into watching a bad movie.  I'm smart.  I'm smart.  What's the age?  Carnivorous Humanoid Underground Dwellers.  Dwellers.  That's what Chud meant.  Yeah.  Oh, all right.  So you want to go with the main groundhog guy there? 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  Punxsutawney Phil right there in...  You think they're partying?  Philly, not Philly, Pennsylvania.  I don't even know where that is.  Do you know where that is?  Gobbler's Knob.  Or Gobble's...  Yeah, but where is it on the map?  Gobbler's Hog.  I have no idea.  Gobble the Hog.  I wouldn't have known any of this if it wasn't for the movie.  That made him more popular.  Do you know he's 75% accurate?  How does that happen, though? 
[01:15:00]  It's lucky.  It means nothing.  It means nothing.  75% is pretty good.  No, because you've got some guy that's the puppet master going,  All right, today, we know that it's going to be in early spring, so, you know, he's good.  So you think that, like, they check a weatherman and all that almanac stuff and use that?  Then they use some trickery.  Oh, I thought the groundhog knew.  What's the...  What a fucking asshole.  Wait, what is the...  What does the fucking thing do?  See, he comes out and he talks to the guy, 
[01:15:30]  and if he gets so scared of his shadow and runs away,  then we're screwed.  Then we get, like...  But they scare the shit out of the groundhog every day with the media and the fucking drugs.  The drugs and the stupid band.  He's petrified.  Right.  I hate it.  You know, Peter wanted a robot, and people can be annoying,  but I was watching him drag this fucking thing out.  He's clawing to stay in this house so fucking fruity voice Bloomberg doesn't pull him out.  Fruity voice.  Leave the fucking groundhog alone.  Stupid ritual.  It's an old Dennis Leary bit, but I don't really give a shit about the ugly animals. 
[01:16:00]  Groundhog's a little cute.  If it was a cute kitten or something, then there'd be outrage every year.  That would be funny to have a kitten every year,  and they'd drag him out, and it's got his claws out, and it doesn't want to come out.  Yeah.  Groundhog with his little fat body just wanted to stay in his awful house.  Then it would be an uproar every year if it was a cute animal,  but it's a groundhog.  Fucking...  It's a rat.  Yeah.  It is a big rat.  Al Roker stole our bit, or Anthony's bit.  What?  Yo, Fante!  What's up, boys? 
[01:16:30]  What's up?  What did Al do?  Al.  Hey, I don't know the...  You know, Al is franchised out now.  There's a thing on Headline...  On the Weather Channel, it's called Wake Up with Al.  Right.  The guy that played in Groundhog Day movie is in Puck-de-Cawney this morning.  He did Anthony's bit.  He goes, Al?  Al Roker?  I wanted to push my fucking TV in the floor.  Al?  First of all, I've been doing the Groundhog.  Ned, Ned Ryerson, Phil, Phil Conner, or Connors?  Look at that, Phil. 
[01:17:00]  No, but in the movie, Phil.  Phil?  Phil Conner?  Yeah.  It's a Phil.  It's actually the movie's bit.  Yeah, exactly.  We just quoted the dumb movie.  I've never seen the whole movie.  Joe DeRosa.  Fuck Joe DeRosa.  Why is it actually...  Why are you trying to save your phone call, Fante?  Fante.  There goes Fante.  That's a funny scene from the American Office, but he makes the shark fit.  Oof.  You're not a big fan of the American Office?  No, no, it's cool.  First season was good.  Second season was bad.  Second season. 
[01:17:30]  They're up to season 28 or something.  I know.  And you could tell.  I'm not a big fan of the American version.  Oh, the critics love it.  They certainly do.  What did she do?  That was just a close-up.  Just her hair's a little different.  No, there's something going on.  Something going on?  I've got to ask you.  Yeah.  I know we're going to do the Groundhog audio in a second.  What happened?  A little thicker.  And I'm just asking without...  I might not even answer this question.  Oh, shit.  Have you ever found Steve Carell funny?  Uh, yeah, yeah, back on The Daily Show when he was one of the correspondents. 
[01:18:00]  I thought he was pretty funny.  He had a good delivery.  Four-Year-Old Virgin and all the stuff he's done since.  No, it's not.  Do you find him funny?  Not to the point where he is the giant star he is today.  Yeah.  Jimmy.  Can I tell you, and I honestly, I've never seen a Steve Carell vehicle.  I don't watch The Daily Show.  Vehicle.  I love that vehicle.  Meaning, I've never seen fucking Four-Year-Old Virgin.  I know him from The Office. 
[01:18:30]  I've seen literally probably the pilot episode of The American Office, and it was okay, but  I didn't like the...  I thought the awkwardness was kind of like stagey.  I also felt the same way about Curb.  I thought, oh, the awkward moment.  It just wasn't as believable to me as the...  You don't like Curb?  I don't...  I'm not saying it's not a good show.  It just...  It did nothing for me, but again...  Obviously, it's a good show.  The one problem with Curb Your Enthusiasm is that a lot of the people that Larry chooses  for the show can't keep up with him, as far as that douchey, uncomfortable, spontaneous 
[01:19:00]  shit they do with that show.  But Larry David's fucking amazing.  Well, it's kind of good, I think, because it shows him as being really out of control  and just...  Because he's barely acting.  I mean, all the stories you hear, that's how he is.  So it's effortless for him.  Yeah, he's crazy.  And then you get everyone else trying to do the same thing as he does.  It's the only, probably, issue I have with the show.  It's still a great show.  Yeah, I don't...  I saw, like, moments of it here and there.  And there's one I thought was really clever, but it did make me laugh.  Which one?  Where Alan Arbus plays the creepy uncle, or the uncle where he's lying about being molested. 
[01:19:30]  There's some lying, and at the end he walks into the woman's...  Whatever it was, it was some mix-up, but it turned out to be funny.  You ever see the Kid Toucher episode?  Is that the one where he...  I saw one moment where he walks out with a fucking bottle of water in his fucking...  pants out of the bathroom?  There's a kid in the bathroom, and he walks out and looks like he has a heart on?  Yeah, that was a different episode.  The Kid Toucher episode, like, it's a sex predator moves into the neighborhood, and Larry  doesn't really know at that point, I think, and he meets him in a parking lot, and the 
[01:20:00]  guy fixes his golf swing.  So Larry's so excited that this guy...  So now he becomes friends with him and invites him to the party, and everyone else knows he's  a fucking Kid Toucher, and Larry's like, could care less?  It's a great episode.  Don't say...  I like that show.  Did you...  You like Seinfeld?  Never...  I maybe have seen one or two episodes of Seinfeld.  Really?  Not...  Again, not because I think it stinks, but because I just have no interest in sitcoms.  Wow, that's weird.  Hmm.  That's odd.  I saw the masturbation episode. 
[01:20:30]  I don't either.  That was funny.  Yeah, like, I don't have interest in sitcoms or anything, but that goes beyond.  No, I know.  That's just really fucking well done.  I started doing stand-up right around the time it started, like 90, and I was out every  night, and it just...  Yeah.  But the moments I've seen were funny.  I don't think I saw it first run.  I wasn't like a fan where I would catch it when it was actually on the air.  It was after, you know, when it goes into reruns, but...  I hate the music. 
[01:21:00]  Why?  How is that sound?  I don't like that sound that annoys me.  We got the Groundhog Audio, so we'll...  Please.  We'll start with the main guy, and then we got the...  Punxsutawney Phil.  And then we got Staten Island Chuck coming in.  Here we go.  Hear ye!  Hear ye!  Oh, I forgot about this guy.  See, this is full of tradition.  See?  What tradition?  Where does this come from? 
[01:21:30]  Well, actually, Germany.  Oh, you know.  You know the answer.  Yes, yes, yes.  It's an old German thing.  That they brought over to Pennsylvania, because a lot of Germans ended up over there.  And, yeah, they pull him out, and then he talks to the guy.  And he reads the scroll, does the whole hear ye, hear ye thing in their oldie time outfits,  and lets you know what's going on.  Why is Jimmy looking down in disgust? 
[01:22:00]  It's because it is just a horribly stupid thing.  As you're talking, I'm thinking, how stunned would the people be if his hear ye, hear ye was interrupted because a shot rang out?  Fucking, how great would that be?  Just, yeah.  That pink mist you see through your scope of the groundhog's head exploding.  People who were at the Kennedy assassination said that it sounded like an exploding watermelon.  Like a watermelon that got dropped when his head got hit. 
[01:22:30]  Like, pfff!  Whoa, nice.  You could hear it.  How about that?  So that's probably what it would sound like if the guy yelling, hear ye, hear ye.  Hear ye, hear ye.  You want the guy or the groundhog to get nailed?  No, I don't want the groundhog.  What, the groundhog's just an animal minding its business while some fucking cunt in a big coat pulls him out.  That's that whole guy's job, to be a fucking cunt and hassle the animal.  I fucking hate that guy.  I love your take on stuff. 
[01:23:00]  Well, it's so...  It's true.  That's his whole gig.  Hey, you ever watch the...  I'm the guy.  Hope he has fucking prostate cancer.  And I hope the doctor announced it by going, hear ye, hear ye.  That cock will never get hard again.  Pulls a bloody tumor out of his asshole.  Exactly.  Holds it up.  Now, claw your way back into the bed.  I imagine he has bourbon bad breath, too.  Of course he does.  He has to.  Just horrendous fucking breath.  Well, they've been partying all week over there.  I hate it.  Marcus St. Louis has a question for Jimmy, because I think you just shocked a lot of people with the fact that you've never seen Seinfeld. 
[01:23:30]  Let's go to Marcus St. Louis.  No, no, I've seen very, very few.  Very few.  I've seen a couple.  Which is basically like not seeing it.  Yeah, I don't...  Yes, sir.  I mean, it's on five times a day.  Well, you know the deal.  Go ahead, Mark.  Well, Jimmy, I just want to know, have you ever rented a DVD?  Yes, sir.  I'm very up on things.  I just didn't watch.  I don't watch.  I've never seen a full...  I can't say I've never.  I've seen moments here and there.  I've seen it when it was on.  But I don't know anything about...  I know who the characters are. 
[01:24:00]  Did you ever see that episode of Seinfeld where they act like none of them have ever seen Melrose Place before, but they've really all seen it?  I have not.  But you know what?  People have quoted enough Seinfeld to me where I realized it was a funny show.  There was something that I do where I actually wait for someone to turn around to see if I throw a dollar in the tip cup.  And somebody mentioned that.  Yeah, Jason Alexander did that.  And then I'm like, fuck, I'd do the same thing.  So I can understand why people thought it was a great show.  Because the things I've heard quoted and the moments I've seen have been decent. 
[01:24:30]  Why would I lie, dude?  I really just...  It changed the sitcom, obviously.  Did it?  Yeah, it absolutely did.  But it seems like they're going back to old school sitcoms again with that basic bullshit formula.  Let's say hi to Trevor in Punxsutawney.  Trevor?  Really?  See ya.  Morning, boys.  Good morning, Trevor.  Happy birthday, Jeremy.  Thank you, Trevor.  Yeah, I lived in that super town.  I'm 30, almost 35 years old. 
[01:25:00]  And that's been my goal for years.  Instead of it comes up out of that hole, just stand back an hour and a half of 50 cal and just watch its head turn to bush.  But it's not the problem.  It's just an animal minding its fucking beeswax trying to get a nibble of whatever those fat, cunty animals eat.  It's the asshole guy.  Hear ye, hear ye.  And the mayor wasting tax...  How much does it cost to send the mayor down to that stupid fucking event?  Well, there's a couple different ones.  Is that an island?  How about this, Bloomberg? 
[01:25:30]  How about you pull the potted plants out of the middle of Broadway?  You fuck.  Instead of messing around with that stupid pucks-a-tawny fucking hump.  And that'll mean that spring comes early, right, Jimmy?  Exactly.  Yeah.  Get rid of the fucking beach chairs.  That means winter's going to be a little longer.  Yeah.  If the homeless see the police and run away, it means we're going to...  How about you stop taking out your fucking rich man's aggression on working class people  that have to drive.  Your fucking spoiled rich man's aggression because you get fucking...  You get taken everywhere by state troopers and bodyguards. 
[01:26:00]  You could take the subway all over, and if you need to get somewhere, they'll clear the road.  Why am I shouting?  I don't know.  I thought you were talking to me for a minute.  No.  You're right, though, man.  He really does.  He has like a weird thing with the working class.  I don't know.  Just a spoiled rich man.  I don't know why the masses like this Bloomberg.  I don't really understand.  There was no other good choice, honestly.  Yeah.  Bill W. in Connecticut.  Bill W.  Hello, Bill.  Hey, guys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  How are you?  Very good.  This tradition actually is back from the evil times. 
[01:26:30]  And what it is, is they felt that the shadow was the tainted soul.  And that wintertime was when they would cleanse it.  And so that's where this bullshit all comes from.  Good.  That's what we're doing now.  When we have LASIK eye surgery available.  And fucking a digital cable.  And we now have a plane that can leave the atmosphere.  But let's see if the soul leaves the groundhog.  And we're going to be cold.  Fucking assholes we are.  Jesus Christ.  They used to do it with bears. 
[01:27:00]  But obviously now they're too big of pussy.  That's a little dangerous.  Well, you know what?  I would have respect for the dumb guy in the big overcoat and the fucking top hat if he did this with a bear.  A bear.  How about this?  Here's how you get the groundhog out of the little thing.  Put a corn cob in your asshole and dangle it right in front of his little house.  How about if he claws your cheeks badly where you need stitches?  Well, let's hear the hear ye, hear ye, guys.  Hear ye, hear ye.  Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.  Three hear ye. 
[01:27:30]  On Gobbler's Knob on this glorious Groundhog Day, February 2nd, 2010, Punxsutawney Phil, the seer of seers,  the prognosticator of all prognosticators, awoke to the call of President Bush.  Oh, my God.  What?  What?  This is nice.  What was that laugh?  Who laughed?  I hope they laughed because of something else.  Like, I hope there was a guy in a wheelchair going up and the ramp just collapsed and he fell on the cold concrete.  I hope that's why that laugh happened. 
[01:28:00]  There was a chuckle in there.  There really was a hearty chuckle.  She probably thought the prognosticator of prognosticators was funny.  Look, it's an excuse to take a day off if you live in the area.  Get drunk with your friends and just enjoy the winter morning there, Jimmy.  Staten Island.  Joe and P.A.  No, this is the Punxsutawney.  I know, but I'm saying.  The big one.  This is the classier version.  This is Led Zeppelin.  The other one's Zebra.  Yeah, wait till you get to the fucking Staten Island version.  If Chuck comes out and he has a clothespin on his nose, the fucking West Shore Expressway is going to remain open. 
[01:28:30]  Joe.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, you guys are missing a little something about Punxsutawney.  Basically, down in the town, everybody gets real, real drunk before this happens in the morning.  Stays up all night.  And then, Anthony, I've got one for you.  They all get real drunk and you take school buses up to the top of the mountain.  It's like heaven on earth for you, bud.  Ah, nice.  You know what?  It's a nice little party, Jimmy.  Sounds fun. 
[01:29:00]  I got to make it one year.  There you go.  All right.  Punch it out, boys.  We should have sent E-Rock or somebody.  Apparently, though, Punxsutawney Phil is one of the most well-taken-care-of groundhogs ever.  One day, they've got to pull him out of his stupid house and rattle him around a little bit.  But the rest of the year, he's fucking living the life of Riley.  If you go to Punxsutawney, I guess you could see him.  I gather.  I would imagine he's in some dumb cage or something. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I want to suck Punxsutawney Phil's dick.  I want to pick him up with his little hands, and I just want to hold him over my face and suck his little dick.  Like he's an oversized baby.  Dude, well, just so you watch his claws.  The more I suck, watch his claws relax, and he just gives in and takes his fucking Punxsutawney Phil sucking.  I want Punxsutawney Phil to come in my mouth. 
[01:30:00]  You think that would shock everybody?  What the fuck is wrong with you?  The horror people would feel.  You think they would be horrified?  Imagine if you just laid back and let Punxsutawney Phil fuck your face until he came.  Oh, my God.  Because he has little claws, and they're always grappling for freedom.  Yes.  But if you sucked it right, he would eventually stop clawing it.  You'd have to wear a neck guard, like a neck brace, so he didn't hit your jugular.  Oh, classic.  Awoke to the call of President Bill Dealey. 
[01:30:30]  He greeted his handlers, John Griffiths and Ben Hughes.  After casting a joyful eye towards thousands of his faithful followers, Phil proclaimed,  If you want to know next, you must read my text.  As the sky shines bright above me, my shadow I see beside me.  Six more weeks of winter it will be.  Boo! 
[01:31:00]  Kill Phil!  Kill Phil!  They all have to digitally ray Puxsutawney Phil.  That's his punishment for six more weeks of winter.  They hold his tail up with one of those little cranes.  Like down the shore, it's the little claw that will reach in and grab a prize.  Of course.  That's how you hold up Puxsutawney's tail.  And everybody digitally rapes him as they think of shoveling for six more weeks.  Why am I sexually abusing?  You're completely sexually molesting a poor little groundhog that only supposedly lives three to six years. 
[01:31:30]  Is that it?  That's it for these fuckers.  There's been quite a few of those then, I guess.  I'm sure.  And now we go to Staten Island.  It's a little different there.  It's not as classy.  And I guess the mayor of New York City went to Staten Island for this.  Oh, yeah.  With his big fucking over-the-top fucking construction gloves.  And his womanly voice.  Jimmy said his feminine voice.  Oh, it's the fucking worst.  What's going on there? 
[01:32:00]  Something.  Oops.  Yeah?  Actually, we get to hear Mike Woods.  Oh, really?  Is he hosting?  Local weatherman.  Yeah.  Mike Woods.  Yep, we just heard from Staten Island Chuck himself.  No shadow indicating an early spring coming up.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, what?  They can't even get this shit together.  Wait, wait.  What happened?  Didn't we just hear that it's going to be six more weeks of winter?  Yes, from Punxsutawney Phil, but now Staten Island Chuck says.  And it's the two places aren't that far away.  No!  They're pretty close.  Why don't you get your fucking info together, boys? 
[01:32:30]  Wouldn't that be great if it, like, it was freezing cold there, and then just the line?  Yeah.  And New York is, like, warm?  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yep, we just heard from Staten Island Chuck himself.  No shadow indicating an early spring coming up.  The mayor just spoke.  And I'll tell you what, everybody seems to be happy.  He came back with all his digits.  He got along famously this year.  I mean, it's nothing like what we had last year, but that is the breaking news.  Spring is coming, according to Staten Island Chuck.  They all just fucking booed Punxsutawney Phil. 
[01:33:00]  Yes.  I say Staten Island Chuck and Punxsutawney Phil should be forced to fight a death match,  and then the winner is mauled by a pit bull.  Everybody laughs and throws raw meat into the ring.  Michael Vick looks on and laughs.  So what the fuck?  Is it going to be early fucking?  I'm going with Punxsutawney Phil because this fucking Staten Island Chuck, what does he know? 
[01:33:30]  Doesn't the mayor have something better to do today?  I would think.  Exactly.  I would think.  And why is he trying to take all the attention away from the main place?  Yeah.  I don't know.  He's just doing something.  What is he doing?  Nothing.  What does he actually do?  Wasting his time.  What do these politicians actually do?  Apparently spend a lot of your money for nothing.  Oh, my God.  Did you see what that fucking Pelosi's been doing?  Oh, what a naughty, naughty girl she is.  Hoping it involves a fist and Harvey Keitel.  Almost. 
[01:34:00]  She is just a taxpayer money spending bitch.  Oh.  She spent millions in travel on Air Force jets.  Air Force 8?  Having them.  Yeah.  She gets Air Force 8.  Having them standing by when she might or might not go somewhere.  And then hundreds of thousands of dollars have been spent on booze.  They load her planes up with booze. 
[01:34:30]  And, like, it's a flying party wherever she fucking goes.  And this is what she's doing.  I can't.  She's this powerful, huh?  Third in line.  I look at her.  Taxpayers pay $101,000 for Pelosi's in-flight food and booze.  I look at her and I can't imagine that she's that powerful.  It's strange to me.  And that's just food and booze.  The flights themselves, it has cost millions of dollars for her to just fly around.  She flies her family and her friends on Air Force jets at our fucking expense. 
[01:35:00]  What a fucking entitled, despicable fucking woman she is.  She is horrid.  One of the biggest hypocrites in politics is Nancy Pelosi.  Abso-fucking-lutely.  This bitch.  She probably feels entitled.  Does she have Secret Service protection?  She's so entitled.  I'm sure she does.  She's got some Speaker of the House.  Is that standard for Speaker of the House?  I don't know.  Good question, Jim. 
[01:35:30]  Would Tip O'Neill do that or any of the old Speakers of the House?  Tip, remember, Tip O'Neill was on Cheers.  Remember that?  Was he?  Yeah, he did a cameo on Cheers.  Who were some other Speakers of the House?  Who was some other Speakers of the House?  They speak pretty good.  No fucking idea, man.  Only been a few in our lifetime.  Who was for Bush?  Bush, what?  Tip O'Neill?  Was Newt Gingrich Speaker of the House or is he just the majority leader, majority leader?  He was the Newt Gingrich? 
[01:36:00]  I don't know.  Speaker of the House?  That's a good question.  Let's...  Yeah, Newt was Speaker of the House.  He was, okay.  We should take a break.  We've got to catch up a little bit.  Black History Month?  You want to do today's Black History Month?  Dennis has to.  I'm just reading.  Black History Month?  Yes, it is Black History Month.  We acknowledge the black man.  Well, not quite like everyone else does.  We look a little deeper into black history, more so than a lot of the other stations that  show, you know, Frederick Douglass and everything. 
[01:36:30]  We understand.  We've seen it before.  Who are some of those other all-star blacks?  All-star black guys?  Martin Luther King.  Let's get an all-star team together.  Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman.  Malcolm X.  Malcolm X.  These are all all-stars.  Starting lineup all-stars?  That's starting...  You're talking starting lineup of black people.  All right.  Over history.  What about some more all-star blacks?  Let's see.  Do you put an athlete in there?  No, no, no, no.  No athletes?  No, no.  That's folly.  Not even like a Michael Jordan?  That's folly. 
[01:37:00]  How about Muhammad Ali?  Ali, yes.  Why?  He has to make the all-star black team.  Why?  Because he...  What did he do?  Refused to go to Vietnam.  Made a political statement.  And he...  Ali is fucking...  Politically around the world.  He's pretty big.  I'm going to go with Muhammad Ali.  Way more than a boxer.  You're going to put him in the same category as Rosa Parks.  Yes.  He did more than Rosa Parks.  Rosa Parks got a seat on a bus.  She wasn't even the first to do that.  There were people that said Rosa Parks wanted to spark a boycott, but that had already  happened by somebody else. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, well, then just let's include Pumpsy Green.  Fuck you.  You could...  No, no.  You could have Rosa Parks.  Whoa.  Ali to Pumpsy Green.  That's a bit of a drop-off.  I put Ali in front of Rosa Parks.  Yeah?  Absolutely.  All-stars.  Came up the fucking heavyweight championship.  You know something?  You're right.  I guess if we're looking at what, like, network television, if they were doing a Black History  Month special, they would probably include Muhammad Ali.  No, but I mean as far as important black people.  Do you have to go with Jackie Robinson?  Yes.  Do Jackie Robinson on the all-star black team.  Yeah, yeah.  He's an all-star. 
[01:38:00]  All-star.  But you said no athletes.  Well, he transcends athletics because it's more what he had done.  All right.  Like breaking the barriers.  Here's another one.  Reverend Al.  Yeah!  God!  Jesse Owens.  Jesse Owens.  Again, breaking barriers.  Too many athletes on our all-star black.  There is.  There is.  Well, for blacks, a lot of athletes are what got them social.  Except, like, them breaking barriers, a lot of it came through athletics.  It didn't come through, you know, because they weren't allowed to go to good schools. 
[01:38:30]  But what about the guy that invented the fucking stoplight?  Well, we don't know.  Yeah, I guess we should know.  See, that's what I'm talking about.  We don't know if that really happens.  But a peanut guy.  Come on.  Peanut guy.  All right.  Peanut guy.  All-star black team.  But those guys, you're talking about black people that furthered black.  I think Ali did a lot more to make black people's lives very good in the U.S.  than the guy who invented the stoplight, which is just a good invention.  My God.  No, I think.  I don't think so.  I look at it exactly the other way. 
[01:39:00]  There is a guy that had an idea, a go-getter, went with it.  The white man stole it, I'm sure.  Yeah, well.  All right.  So we go with, what about the big bopper?  No.  Colorado Brandon.  I thought the big bopper was black.  I heard that on the answer replay.  I honestly thought he was black up until three fucking days ago.  We put Jesse Owens on the fucking all-star black team.  I would put Richard Pryor.  I know a lot of people.  Yes.  Yes.  Richard Pryor.  Absolutely.  Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, and Richard Pryor.  Come on.  You're reading the black 100.  We're making our own list.  What?  No, I'm not.  Is that on there?  Is Pryor on there?  We're just talking about like historic black people.  Whoa.  How many?  How many?  How many?  How many?  How many?  What all-star team are we going with?  NBA rules?  Major League Baseball?  Or the Pro Bowl?  Maybe not Pryor.  I've got to go with.  How many on our all-star black team?  25.  We go 25?  So I think you might have to leave Richard Pryor out.  I'm sorry, Jim. 
[01:40:00]  I don't know about that.  You might have to.  You might have to.  Can we keep a running list?  Can somebody type a running list?  Jesse Jackson?  No.  Can we put George Jefferson?  The great Elijah Muhammad?  George Jefferson?  No.  Elijah Muhammad was, some people say.  Nation of Islam?  He was half, I think he was half black and half white.  I think he started.  I think W.D. Fard was the guy who started the Nation of Islam.  I was going to say W.D. 40.  No, W.D. Fard.  Slippery character.  Ha, ha, ha.  They say W.D. Fard, I believe, was a very light-skinned black man that could live in 
[01:40:30]  the white world.  I think so.  But no, I would not put Elijah.  I don't know.  Would you put Elijah Muhammad?  We went Frederick Douglass, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Frederick Douglass.  Of course.  Frederick Douglass is a big one.  Who else we got?  Jesse Owens.  We had to.  Jesse?  You have to go with Jesse.  Jackie Robinson and Ali.  Those are, I'd say, the three athletes.  I don't think we could add another athlete.  Probably not, unless they change things.  No.  Maybe we're forgetting somebody.  I don't know.  Hank Aaron?  Hank Aaron.  Nah, he didn't change things like Jackie Robinson did. 
[01:41:00]  I don't know.  I'm kidding.  Nat King Cole, maybe?  No.  Nat King Cole.  Because of the crossover to mainstream with music.  What about the...  It's a Nat King Cole.  What about the black singer where they had to empty the pool water because she went for  a swim?  Oh, right.  She should be on the all-star black team.  Wasn't that...  Who was that?  Billie Holiday?  Was it Billie Holiday?  I don't know.  I'm just trying to think of old school.  Yeah.  I think we pretty much covered like the big ones.  No, we didn't.  Right?  All right.  Hold on.  We got Jeff in Atlanta.  We're going for the all-star black team today. 
[01:41:30]  Jeff?  Yes.  Yes.  Happy birthday, Jim.  Thank you.  Emmett Till was a 14-year-old little boy in 1955 that was whistling at the white woman  in Mississippi that was killed.  And that was what started the civil rights movement.  Yeah.  I've never heard of him.  Really?  Emmett Tillis, right?  Emmett Tillis.  Oh, it is Tillis, okay.  T-I-L-L.  Yeah.  So does he have to make the all-star black team?  Hard to say because what he did for blacks was not intentional.  Like, he was killed.  He was killed pretty brutally, I think. 
[01:42:00]  Well, what happened, he was killed, and then they took, his mom took his body up to Chicago,  and they had, she forced to have an open casket funeral.  Oh, boy.  He was mutilated after laying in the river for like two days in the summertime.  And then he was published in Jet Magazine, a black newspaper back in 1955, and Medgar Edwards  and quite a few black politicians and activists got down in Mississippi, and the guys got acquitted  about a year later.  You're right.  Medgar Edwards is another one you got to put on there. 
[01:42:30]  I wouldn't say Emmett because, again, he was somebody, he's like a martyr without meaning  to be.  I would say Medgar Edwards, though.  King, obviously.  Malcolm X.  Who do we have so far?  We got, we got the Malcolm X, we got the Martin Luther King, we got the three athletes.  Who do we got, Danny?  Jesse Owens.  Malcolm X, MLK, Ali, George Washington Carr, Frederick Douglass, Jesse Owens, Goldie Wilson,  Jackie Robinson, Barack Obama, Barack Obama, Barack has not proven himself. 
[01:43:00]  He's the first black president of the United States.  Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, has to be on there.  Could be a complete disaster.  Whoa, whoa, I'll give you.  But what if Obama's presidency turns out to be the first black president?  A complete disaster.  It doesn't matter.  Then you adjust the all-star blacklist.  No.  I'm not giving you Colin Powell.  I'm not giving you Barack Obama.  I'll give you Obama.  You guys are nuts.  I'll give you Obama, though.  I won't give you Obama.  You have to give him Obama.  Nope.  You have to.  You have to.  You can't deny that the first black president... 
[01:43:30]  It's not a list of the first guy.  It's a list of important people that have made a difference.  Yes.  And he was the first.  What if his presidency turns out to be a complete abomination to this country?  He's going to be in the great fucking presence of the great Frederick Douglass with that giant beard?  He immediately gets on the list because he became elected.  And the act of him being elected, there's a lot of people who look at that and go, you know what?  It really can happen. 
[01:44:00]  It's not just a fucking something people say to shut you up.  It actually can become a president.  I certainly don't like this.  Earl Douglas?  What about Earl Douglas?  He should lead the pack.  The Earl Douglas?  By proving that you can be dead emotionally and mentally and still walk.  Let's go ahead and Huntington Ed.  Hey, how you doing?  I'd like to acknowledge Black History Month.  Yes.  Watermelon barbecue Cadillac car.  Oh, right.  Jesus Christ.  People are suggesting Buckwheat and Stymie. 
[01:44:30]  Well.  They were legends back in the 30s with Hal Roach films.  Bill Russell.  All-star black team.  No.  Played in Boston, Ant.  No.  Played in Boston in what, the 50s and the 60s?  That's rough.  You guys are going way off topic here.  I would say no to him.  I would say no to Bill Russell.  All right.  How about Jack Johnson?  First black heavyweight champ.  Thank you, Jason.  Yeah, Jack Johnson I might put on there.  Steve from Bayshore starring in a movie with Charlton Heston does not put you in. 
[01:45:00]  On the list.  Jack Johnson?  Would you say him or Joe Lewis?  I would say Joe Lewis.  Because Joe Lewis, again, it was the perception.  He gave people a lot of pride.  It's like he kind of, he was a hero to people.  I would say Lewis.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Over Jack Johnson, yes.  I'm trying to think if people would do this.  Like if there was a big special on Black History Month on a network, if they would add these people in. 
[01:45:30]  There are people we're missing.  Like whoever led the slave rebellion.  You're right.  They would add Obama.  Of course they would.  They would have to.  I know you're not happy about that, Ant, but.  Who led the slave rebellion?  Sidney Poitier.  Yeah.  First black to win an Oscar.  Sidney Poitier.  The fine act of Sidney Poitier.  Sidney Poitier.  Yes.  Do we make them?  Yeah?  Absolutely.  Yeah?  Yeah?  Yeah, because again, it's guys that did something very symbolic that people look at and go,  wow, that can be.  Are we in agreement?  It can be done.  Poitier?  All-star black team? 
[01:46:00]  He never changed his hair to appease white society.  He never conked his hair.  And he never played a fucking dummy or a weakling.  He always played a strong, smart guy.  In a time where that was...  What about Sammy Davis Jr.?  Nah, he was just an entertainer, you know?  All right.  Scotty from Georgia saying, Coco beware.  Coco fucking beware shit.  I think we got a hoot out of Sam down the hall.  A hoot hoot?  Coco beware.  What about Clubber Lang?  Clubber Lang?  He beat up Rocky. 
[01:46:30]  How about Famous Amos?  How about Robert...  Paul O'Creed, though.  Oh, all right.  We haven't gone into the world of music for the most part.  What are we looking at?  You've got to go way...  Well, I got two.  I got two.  Robert Johnson is a biggie.  BB King.  That's way too late.  Yeah.  We've got to go, like, Muddy Waters or somebody.  Really?  I would say, don't forget, the Tuskegee...  Wait, Tusk...  How do you say that?  Tuska...  Tuska...  Tuska...  Tuskegeegee.  I know I'm saying it wrong.  The Tuskegee.  Tuskegee Airmen.  Tuskegee Airmen. 
[01:47:00]  Tuskegee Airmen.  Tuskegee Airmen, and also...  Even though I've heard that a lot of what happened to them was a myth, and that some  of them had syphilis...  I've heard...  Whatever, but I would say them, and also the black in glory.  The platoon of ex-slaves.  The Massachusetts...  That fought in the Civil War.  That wanted to fight in the Civil War.  Yeah.  As a group, I would say...  You can't pick out one of them.  Yeah.  I would say those two groups have to be on the list.  Are we getting close to 25, Danny? 
[01:47:30]  Not really, right?  By the way, anyone could have kicked ass in a P-51 Mustang.  I just want to say...  I understand.  Jesus Christ.  Right.  Yeah, it's hard to single...  I guess it has to be a thing sometimes.  Lead Belly.  Yeah, 10 people.  Tay Zonday.  Lead Belly, no.  He was just a good...  He went to jail for fucking, I think, murder, attempted murder.  How about the New Orleans Beer Looter?  Oh, yeah.  He's been on a lot of... 
[01:48:00]  You know something?  Oh, the Heineken guy?  He's very famous.  The Heineken Looter.  Now it's starting to get into our list.  Now we're getting crazy again.  Now we're getting into our list.  We're really trying to do this right.  The Heineken Looter is so famous.  Tiger Woods.  No.  Yes.  But he just changed golf, really.  Maybe you're right.  Yeah, maybe you're right.  Al Jolson.  Jesus.  Nat King Cole?  I said Nat King Cole.  I think yes for him.  It wasn't Samsonite.  Yes.  It was American Tourister.  But I get your point. 
[01:48:30]  Bill Cosby.  But you should do Richard Pryor before Bill Cosby.  I don't know about...  You know what, man?  As much as I love Pryor, Cosby paved the way, man.  Because Cosby was a mainstream accepted guy that people couldn't deny.  But he didn't change...  How pathetic are we?  We can't even come up with 25 black...  We came up with some pretty important black people.  We can't even come up with 25 black all-stars.  Oh, everyone's imitation of the guy?  That's the guy...  That's the white guy, right?  The white guy's so wrong. 
[01:49:00]  Stuff like the looter.  The Weining and the looter.  He did such a good job, man.  What about Pants on the Ground guy from American Idol?  Pants on the Ground.  No.  Started a little sensation with that dumb little thing.  I know we're missing some people.  Oprah?  Yes.  Hiram Rhodes?  Revels?  So yes to Oprah?  I'd say yes to Oprah, yeah.  Why yes to Oprah?  Because, again, she's probably the most powerful celebrity in the world, or at least in this country.  She's spiritual.  And she has a tremendous influence in this country.  At this point, she's spiritual. 
[01:49:30]  She's a deity.  She changes the perception a lot of this country has of different events by whatever take she has on it.  Oh, my God.  She's a very powerful person.  Miss Peaches has...  No!  We said Harriet Tubman.  We did?  Yeah.  What about Run-DMC, like, mixing the rock and the fucking...  No, no.  Alex Haley?  Because he wrote Roots, and again, it was the slavery that was made out of Alex Haley.  I know, he's dead.  He really brought slavery into a... 
[01:50:00]  I can't say it.  James Evans.  Oh, you know what?  This guy's got a great point.  Same!  Derek in Louisiana.  Hey, what's up, buddy?  Go Saints, go.  What about large fish burn there?  He saved us from the machines by getting Neo out.  A large fish burn.  Yes, that's true.  Farrakhan's coming in, Jesus.  I would give...  I'd give Farrakhan...  Million Man March, putting that together?  No, just because he leads the nation of Islam.  That's a massive thing.  Very powerful.  Louis Armstrong's coming in.  No. 
[01:50:30]  That's just an entertainer.  No.  Oh, God, that's in the U.S.  It's only in the U.S., because someone said Mandela.  Hey, Maya Angelou, maybe.  Maya Angelou?  Oh, God, is her poetry stupid?  The Caged Bird Sings.  Come on, that's a good one.  Shut it.  It's good.  It stinks on ice.  It's very good.  I have to disagree.  The Caged Bird Sings.  That's a very good one.  What about the great Bismarcky?  No.  Maybe.  Because a lot of times we would go to school...  Yeah, let's fall down a little bit with this Bismarcky.  Yeah, I went to a school once, and somebody was tongue-kissing my girl deep in her mouth. 
[01:51:00]  And I didn't know what...  And on the way home, I heard Biz, and I'm like, I'm not alone.  Thurgood Marshall?  Of course.  Yeah.  First black on the Supreme Court, yeah.  You've got to put him in there.  Sure.  All right.  Good one.  Good one.  What are we up to, Danny?  Are we going to make 25?  Oh, easily.  We're just fucking, you know...  What do you mean easily?  Because we're vetoing a lot.  Oh, we're...  All right.  Mike Small from Chicago.  Nelson Mandela.  No, but I don't...  Nelson Mandela.  I'm only saying in the U.S.  No, you got to...  No, you can't go to the whole world. 
[01:51:30]  Jesus, there's African leaders and...  All right, but did Nelson Mandela change things in America?  No.  Other than that, people were very happy and proud of him, but no, I mean, I would say  he got to stay in the U.S.  Mike Tyson.  It's Black History Month here.  All right.  No, not Tyson.  We're up to 12, you said?  About stacks.  Yes, he showed that you can have a great ass and still be shot.  Fucking stacks.  So, we got to go back in history more.  We got...  Yeah, I know.  Come on.  Martin Luther King Jr., we got... 
[01:52:00]  Malcolm X, we got Farrakhan.  I agree with those three.  I'm going, like, 50s or 40s.  How about this?  Can we say whoever started the Slave Rebellion?  I don't know who that was, but there was a slave that started the Slave Rebellion.  Dorothy Dandridge.  Vince from Bayonne, yes.  I thought you were going to say Darth Vader.  Darth Vader.  Oh.  Although, what's his name there?  James Earl Jones.  James Earl Jones, but...  Just has a great voice.  No one gives a shit about him.  This is CNN.  We can't come up with 25.  That's pathetic.  Yeah, we can't.  We're just being selective. 
[01:52:30]  Yes.  Well...  John Muhammad and Lee Malva, would that count as two?  Vargas Garvey, founded the NAACP.  Yep.  Yeah?  Yeah, I would say that.  Marvin Berry.  Marvin Berry should be what?  Marvin Berry as Al.  Yeah, Marcus Garvey.  Even if you put a lot of exclamation points after the name Michael Jordan, we're not putting  him on the list.  I'm sorry.  Never happening.  No.  Great athlete, but so what?  Yeah.  Not like a Jesse Owens great athlete or a Jackie Robinson great athlete. 
[01:53:00]  Shut up.  That's a video game.  Dude, some of these are so fucking funny.  And I can't read them, but...  We know which one you mean.  Of course.  It's hysterical.  This guy's got a really good one.  Rich Norlando.  One we're forgetting.  Rich.  Hey.  Hey.  You're going to forget about a very unknown, but extremely important black guy, Ted the  black guy.  Ted the black guy.  Yeah, definitely be on the list.  Y'all motherfuckers leaving me out. 
[01:53:30]  What's up, Ted the black guy?  What's up, motherfucker?  Y'all leaving me out.  Could you help us out with this all-star black team?  I certainly can, Gregory.  Yeah, but who are we missing on the list?  Y'all missing a whole lot of motherfuckers.  Ted the black guy, really?  Yeah.  How about that motherfucker from the...  What's that show on the mashup?  That motherfucker, I'll put him on.  Staley T for the mashup?  Yeah, word.  Yeah, word.  Keep up Teddy in the motherfucking his house. 
[01:54:00]  Ted the black guy, everyone.  We certainly am, Gregory.  Yep.  Spike Lee.  Come on.  I would say no to Spike Lee.  No.  That's like junior varsity shit.  We're going all-star.  All-star black team.  All right, we're going to have to think about it through the break.  Rodney King.  No.  No.  We still got to fill up, what, 10 spots?  10, 11 spots?  Yeah.  All right, well, it's Black History Month.  This is who we're acknowledging today as we go to break.  And we'll try to finish this list after the break. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, see, we pick lesser known.  And the talent coach has a Super Bowl bit.  Super Bowl bit?  This is the company that Nick Cannon's using to learn how to do radio, which is terrific  considering he's in the number one market in New York City.  Is Nick Cannon going to be doing this Super Bowl bit?  I don't know.  If the talent coach said it.  In my hand, I hold the Super Bowl bit from the talent coach.  I'm not even reading it.  Wait to hear about this one after the break.  But first, Black History Month. 
[01:55:00]  Who are we acknowledging?  A little rush?  YYZ, right?  In music news, I don't know what the fuck's going on with Aerosmith.  But now, Steven Tyler, you hear, like, things are going really bad.  Then you're like, nah, the band's cool.  And then you hear Steven Tyler is going to rehab.  Well, the latest is that Steven Tyler is threatening to sue his bandmates if they hire a new Aerosmith  singer.  But I don't know what the rest of the band's supposed to do because they really want to  continue.  And Steven Tyler is kind of being a pain in the ass. 
[01:55:30]  Rumors of drug abuse.  Rumors that he's in rehab.  Rumors that he wants to do a solo album and then go back to Aerosmith.  And the rest of the guy's like, fuck that.  They're seeing that some of these other bands are hiring a new singer and doing very, very  well.  And I think they want to go down that road.  I wonder who owns the name, though.  Maybe they could start a band but can't call it Aerosmith.  So they have to call it, like, almost Aerosmith or something like that?  Aerosmith?  Aerosmith.  A-I-R.  Yeah.  It spells Smith different. 
[01:56:00]  A-R-R-O-W-Dash?  Yeah.  Aerosmith.  You're an Aerosmith.  Aerosmith.  What is that?  Aerosmith.  What does the name of that band mean, anyway?  Aerosmith.  What does it mean?  An Aerosmith is a term.  It's an old flying term.  An Aerosmith was a guy.  Anthony would know that.  Who was involved in aeronautics.  You blew it by saying that, Jimmy.  No, it isn't.  You blew it.  Jimmy, it knows all about that shit.  You had to go another direction in Aerosmith. 
[01:56:30]  All right.  Hey, Super Bowl.  We haven't even talked about the Super Bowl.  So, first of all, does anyone give a shit in this room?  I want the Saints.  Me too.  Jimmy wants the Saints.  Do you care either way, Ant?  It's not one of those things where I really give a shit who wins or not.  I'm going to watch, and I think it'll be a good game to watch, but it's not one of those  that I really care.  I think I'll kind of decide in the first quarter who I want to win. 
[01:57:00]  Well, that's kind of weird.  Yeah.  They're saying they want to beat the shit out of Peyton Manning.  I mean, they were a little more subtle about it in the paper, but basically they want to  hit him really fucking hard and hurt him.  Dude, my Saints have waited a long time to be here.  You're the Saints.  Yep.  So, I mean, they have to do it finally.  Yeah.  Fairweather Ted.  I know we've done a lot of Ted today, but still.  No, Jimmy's been on the Saints bandwagon for years.  That's all he used to talking about.  Saints, Saints, Saints.  Shut up.  Yeah.  My team comes marching in. 
[01:57:30]  Remember I used to sing that?  Yep.  Yep.  I remember.  None of us remember that, Jimmy.  What else?  CBS sold out the Super Bowl, so you're going to see a lot of commercials.  No more commercials to be had.  And what was up with that gay commercial?  Do we care?  They wouldn't allow the gay dating site commercial or something?  Oh, I thought it was for a certain website.  What, the gay dating commercial?  Yeah.  What the fuck is that about?  I don't know.  I guess CBS said no to the gay dating site or something like that.  There's a gay dating site?  I don't know. 
[01:58:00]  Why did they say no to that?  But then some people saying the commercial in general just sucked and the quality of the  commercial sucked.  And who gives a shit if you got the $3 million, right?  I think it's $3 million this year.  $3 million a minute or something like that?  $3 million a minute.  Or 30 seconds or something?  They, uh...  Wow.  Well, people...  You know what it is?  People are very, uh...  With football, they're very family-oriented.  They don't want homos messing up their, uh...  Super Bowl experience.  The homos.  The homos.  Uh, oh boy, you should have seen, uh, on old, uh, nmania.com how, uh, they were upset 
[01:58:30]  about the eHarmony commercial that shows the black, uh, woman and the white guy on the  boat.  Oh.  And they're kissing and stuff.  Oh, boy.  Were they...  They're not a fan of that one?  Were they ready for a boycott?  Let me tell you.  A boycott.  They really need to fucking relax on that site.  Who gives a shit?  Half of those guys would let a black girl suck their dicks.  No, I don't think they would.  I know you...  Half of those fucking phone...  Believe me.  You think?  Yes. 
[01:59:00]  A hot chick.  Believe me.  The only...  The Aryans I really respect are the guys in prison, like the guys who really will cut  your throat.  Really?  And there are some hardcore Aryans, but I think most of them, most of them, feel very threatened  by blacks and are afraid of them, and that's where they get their strength from.  I'm not talking all of them.  Well, isn't that any organization?  You're threatened and afraid of something, so you make an organization to kind of, you  know, quell or, you know, put down what scares you.  Yeah, but I mean, there are hardcore Aryans that really don't cross those lines and really 
[01:59:30]  will fucking stand up and punch them.  Like, those guys, and then there are the other guys who are on the computer, who have their  fucking cool computer names, you know, DOMINATION!  You know, DOMINATION!  DOMINATION!  You know, and they're fucking, and they say, like, white power-y things.  Yeah.  You know, and they're fucking...  And again, I'm sure the black militants have the same shit.  You know what the odd thing is? 
[02:00:00]  This isn't really a...  From what I've seen, I've been on many, many websites, my friends, and this doesn't seem  to fall into the category of an Aryan or white supremacist thing.  It's a goofy message board with horrific things on it.  Right.  Like, it's just...  It's like any other message board you go to, where there's, you know, douchebags saying  stupid shit, there's this guy, the other guy, and that's what it is.  Uh, but, um, you know, I have to admit, some of the shit is repugnant, and some will make 
[02:00:30]  you laugh.  But, uh, you know, well, me.  I would laugh.  I laugh at racist stuff.  It's horrible.  I laugh at it too.  Horribly racist stuff that sometimes you'll get a chuckle.  Would you let a black girl suck your dick in?  What?  Um, I said I'd probably, um, I'd probably, like, fuck Francine.  You know?  So that's a big yes he would.  She's like that type.  Or would you, you know, where the poo comes out?  Um, once you're fucking, you're all in. 
[02:01:00]  It's all in?  He would do that.  Once you're fucking, you're all in.  Why Francine?  Because she's, um, uh, Tootsie.  Uh, she's not a, uh, she's a Tootsie roll.  She's a psychopath?  She's crazy?  I think, um, she's wild.  I think it's bothered by his feelings toward Francine.  Really?  Because I think it goes against, you know.  It goes against everything I believe in?  Yeah.  So I think it confuses you.  My what, power?  I think that fine black ass confuses you a little bit.  Ah, there's always been, you know, something a little, uh, fuckable about her. 
[02:01:30]  Just don't let, I think.  Just don't let domination see it.  Because she posts angry stuff.  Oh, they're announcing the, uh, the Oscars, huh?  Oh.  Could you at least get the basic ones, the best movie, Oscar nominations?  The Hurt Locker's in for best picture.  Uh, best picture, best, uh, uh, uh.  Yeah, I'd bang that.  I haven't educated.  District 9, unless that's, uh, visual.  Effect.  I just watched it again the other day.  Give me the list.  I kind of liked it.  I didn't like it the first time I watched it.  Oh, I liked it the first time I watched it, but I watched District 9 again just the other 
[02:02:00]  day and was like, yeah, that is a pretty good movie.  Okay.  I kind of like it.  See how I judged it like an asshole?  Yeah, but I haven't seen it yet.  Yeah, look at that, see?  I'd be in the, I'd be up in that ass.  Who's that?  It's Francine.  Oh, wow.  God damn it, is it real?  That's sexy.  How long ago was this done?  What's going on?  She, she really knows how to put the right pictures out there.  She does, I know.  Did I ever tell you I fooled around her?  Huh?  Did I ever tell you I fooled around, Francine?  Oh, yeah.  How was that?  I didn't.  But I mean, I should have lied and said I did.  It would have made me a really fucking cool guy.  I would have liked some details. 
[02:02:30]  I've gotten nowhere with her in 10 years.  It's a little vaginal reconnaissance.  None.  For as ditzy and whorish as she comes off, she really is a gigantic cocktail.  Oh, tremendous.  Oh, really?  Wow.  That's her thing?  Hi, Jimmy.  Yeah.  I never, I never really went in for the big win.  But she sat on your penis before.  She sat on my lap many times and I've gotten a rod.  I've seen you guys like maybe go out to lunch or something.  Honestly, it really is just lunch.  She was doing stand-up for a little while and I would hang with her at the cellar and  nothing. 
[02:03:00]  Should I try?  Oh, my God, yeah.  Yeah, if you can.  Should I give it a whirl?  Yeah, put that fucking big hog in her vag.  Try.  Look, for the radio show, you've got to go there, Ed.  Should I try?  You've got to go there for the radio show.  I'll explain if I do get there what it's like.  Yeah.  Wow.  That would stick with me forever.  Hey.  My family might disown me.  The Razzie nominations.  They wouldn't.  Anthony, the list of the worst movies.  We're going to get the Oscar nominations in a second.  Worst picture of 2010. 
[02:03:30]  Was it?  E-Rock and Jimmy and Ozzy.  Oh, wait.  Damn it, I should have went with Jimmy and Ozzy first.  We've got four of us in studio right now.  It looks like a fruit.  I got him.  Danny Plays.  I'm going to say right now, the worst picture of 2010.  They got five nominations.  I'm going to bet that not one of us has seen one of these movies out of the five.  Ready?  Has anyone in this room seen All About Steve? 
[02:04:00]  Just do your own jokes.  I don't even want to.  I saw it under the alternative title, Cocksucker Incompetence.  Take that.  Take that.  It looks like you're gaining a few.  Sucker Incompetence.  Holy shit.  Yes, I get it.  I'm gay.  Worst picture of 2010.  Did anyone in this room see G.I. Joe, The Rise of Cobra?  Oof.  No.  No.  0 for 2?  Everyone? 
[02:04:30]  Okay.  This third one I heard, it was probably the worst movie.  Will Ferrell.  Of his career and of the year.  Land of the Lost.  Yeah.  Wow, that was supposed to be a big film, huh?  Well, G.I. Joe was supposed to be a big film, too.  None of us saw Land of the Lost?  Yeah.  How about Old Dogs?  Which one was that?  Was that Robin Williams?  In church for Travolta.  In Travolta?  Oh, God, Travolta cannot make a good movie.  He stinks. 
[02:05:00]  Yes, he does.  We might have lost someone on this last one.  I cannot make good movies.  And finally, Transformers.  Danny?  No.  Revenge of the Fallen?  Yeah.  I don't want to see that.  Anyone see Transformers?  Anthony?  No.  No.  No.  Revenge of the Fallen.  I saw the first one.  Well, that's why.  I think Eric's a big Transformers fan.  He probably went and saw it.  Of course he is.  He's got some pocket money.  He probably went and saw it.  He wants to transform from a human into a fat elephant.  He's doing a great job. 
[02:05:30]  Worst picture of the decade they're doing this year, too.  Wow.  The Razzies.  Wow.  You want to?  All right.  Try to figure out worst picture of the decade.  Decade?  I haven't been following me.  So between 2000 and 2010.  That's tough.  I would say.  Wow.  Honestly, if we gave a shit, we would be able to get probably at least three of these.  One of them is a Travolta movie.  I'll say that.  Correctamundo.  I have them in front of me.  Oh, well, yeah.  That would have to be.  Battlefield Earth.  So that one was given away. 
[02:06:00]  Wow.  We don't have to spend much time on this.  Freddy Got Fingered.  Gigli?  Gigli or Gigli?  Gigli.  Oh, my God.  Who was in that?  Was that a Mariah Carey thing?  Yeah.  I think that was Mariah Carey's movie.  No, it's Gigli.  It's about my tits.  No, who was in that?  Fucking Ben Affleck.  What?  Yeah, was that?  Yeah.  Ben Affleck was in Gigli.  Was who?  And J-Lo?  Yeah, J-Lo. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, I think it was Jennifer.  Wow.  He's a Ben Affleck nominated for nine achievements winner of two Razzies.  Daredevil, Gigli, Jersey Girl, Paycheck, Pearl Harbor, Surviving Christmas.  He's been in a lot of shit, huh?  Eddie Murphy, been in a lot of shit, too.  That Adventures of Pluto Nash could be the worst piece of shit ever put to film.  And you tried it?  Well, Jay Moore was in it, so I gave it a look.  And then I just couldn't fucking, I couldn't continue.  Yeah, okay. 
[02:07:00]  Mike Myers, poor Mike Myers.  What happened to his career?  He was fucking huge.  He had Austin Powers.  Raw shaving on TV.  What the fuck is that about?  Oh, wow.  What the fuck?  She's big and fat.  Rob Schneider, worst actor of the decade, and John Travolta.  But the movies, you got Freddy Got Fingered, Gigli, I Know Who Killed Me?  I don't even remember that one.  And Swept Away, which was, I think, a Madonna movie, right?  I have no idea.  I think that was a Madonna thing.  These are horrible.  Yeah, I think that was the one that Guy Ritchie did with her. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  He was forced to do a movie with his wife.  Poor Guy Ritchie, who's done some terrific stuff over the years, and then he's forced  to do a movie with his wife.  All right.  Where were we?  Super Bowl?  I agree with Travolta being...  Yes.  The talent coach.  Yes.  All right.  Oh, the other thing with the Super Bowl.  That's right.  CBS rejects Super Bowl ad from Dante's Inferno, the video game, because the tagline is,  go to hell.  Are you kidding me?  So we can't see go to hell on Super Bowl Sunday. 
[02:08:00]  Nope.  What the fuck?  Is that really the reason?  Where do we live in?  What fucking year is this?  Is that the reason for real?  But when some coach is having an epileptic seizure on the sideline, and he's Carson Schiff,  fuck.  Motherfucker!  Don't show that.  Real close up.  You can read his lips.  Well, you can obviously tell a lot of emotion coming out of the coach today.  They don't acknowledge it.  They try to cover it up like somehow, very emotional out on the field today, as the coach  is yelling, cunt and fuck.  Like, and go to hell is too risky.  I love that during a baseball game, like a pitcher gives up a home run, because they 
[02:08:30]  go right in on his face.  You could see what he's saying.  Motherfucker!  Wow, he's kind of upset with himself out there on the mound.  Obviously frustrated.  Yeah, frustrated.  Well, I did see him say motherfucker, so obviously having a tough time out on the mound.  Fucking A, give me a break.  Fucking hypocritical assholes.  What a fucking, football is a man's sport.  Like, what a pussy organization the NFL is. 
[02:09:00]  It really is.  And CBS.  They're still scolding Rex Ryan for giving the bird.  Ugh.  Don't fucking take the personality of these fucking sports, please.  Fucking, you need more Rex Ryans just speaking their mind and throwing the finger up.  Well, the talent coach who's working with Nick Cannon, supposedly, allegedly, here in New  York City, has a Super Bowl bit.  Oh, yeah.  This talent coach is horrible. 
[02:09:30]  You want to try this one?  We tried the other bits.  All right, I haven't looked at it.  All right, well, let me read this to you.  I haven't even looked at it.  With the Super Bowl this weekend, do the Super Bowl seduction.  All right.  Enough right there.  What the fuck is the Super Bowl seduction?  Funny you should ask.  This bit is great because it marries two things, the talent coach writes.  Yes, men.  E-hominy. 
[02:10:00]  And Steve wonders, because we just heard your FU promo where you're shoving dildos up your  ass that are attached to the fucking refrigerator.  Suction cups.  Exactly.  So stop wondering because that's a vivid imagination that seems to be based on some  kind of weird fucking life experience.  How do you come up with that?  A dildo in a refrigerator is two favorite things.  Speaking of marrying the two.  These are a few of my favorite things.  Yes.  Big balls and hard cocks and sweaty man assholes. 
[02:10:30]  Taking off Mondays.  Big giant assholes.  Little teeny stomachs and twinks that like to sing.  These are a few of my gay things.  And lots of shit on my ding-a-ling.  Getting more info.  D-Boy wrote the promo, though. 
[02:11:00]  Steve just acted in it.  He was too...  Docking and gaping and smelling some ball sack.  Taking some days off and not catching any flack.  Wearing flame clothing.  And branding my sight. 
[02:11:30]  Shit.  A few of my gay-verit things.  Yes.  If I were in the Bible, I'd be a sodomite.  He couldn't wait to act in the fucking promo that D-Boy wrote.  I don't know.  Maybe we could change up the FU promo.  Yeah.  Sucking cup field nose.  Prensing around in Lane Bryant blouses.  Tying a string to the tails of mouses. 
[02:12:00]  All of my friends have beards for spouses.  We got Steve C. on the line.  Steve C.  A little mouse.  Steve C.  Yes. 
[02:12:30]  Grow jobs and hand jobs and cum on my whiskers.  Oh, God damn it.  Fisting and felching and burping up cum.  I am just lazy people think it's dumb.  Is he just back there just sitting there shaking his head? 
[02:13:00]  I don't know why.  What is he doing?  No, because he's not listening.  I don't listen.  He didn't really know about the talent coach this morning, which was a little strange.  No.  Because we did a whole bit on it.  Was he out Friday?  Is that his excuse, though?  But we did like an hour on the talent coach.  And then he got confused.  Yes, Sam.  Sam's got to come up with a little report.  He's listening now.  Oh, is he?  And he's yelling at me because I keep going in to find out if he's listening, which he  still is. 
[02:13:30]  And he's yelling about it.  Somebody finding the Grammy.  Why is he yelling?  I mean, the Oscar nominations.  We can find that in seconds.  That's easy.  We don't need the audio.  We just need the fucking list.  That's what I told him.  But yeah, he was too busy listening to the song about him being a gay, lazy guy.  Let's go back.  We got Steve C. on the line.  Steve C.  Yes.  Mince nuts and donuts and french fried potatoes.  Finding a way to fuck the refrigerator.  San Francisco and Maine and places that are for us, gargling with cum like it's Lavoris. 
[02:14:00]  Jesus, Jimmy.  You got it in, though.  You got it in.  I had to shoehorn.  It was a bit of a shoehorn.  Quick, look at the TV.  Who is that without seeing the name?  I know who that is.  Oh, you do?  Okay.  RuPaul.  Yeah.  Wow, does he have the AIDS now?  No, he's just going out.  I did red eye with him once.  He goes out like that now.  No, but he looks very, very thin.  A little mustache. 
[02:14:30]  Putting my mouth near a fat glory hole.  I hope someone cute is sitting on the pole.  Let's go to Steve C.  Steve C.  Steve, go.  This is Mike in Boston.  Okay.  Well, Steve.  See, goodbye.  Bit runer.  Yeah, dudes.  You got to sacrifice your fucking name and just be Steve C.  Having my butt fucked while he calls me Stevie.  Taking some gum from Governor McGreevy. 
[02:15:00]  Let's go to Steve C. on line one.  Steve C.  Farting out jelly on my partner's belly.  Explaining why my tongue is always smelly.  All right.  Just silly.  If we're doing this, we should do this now.  The Opie and Anthony Show proudly presents a journey through time as seen through the eyes 
[02:15:30]  of Steve Carlisi.  Neil Armstrong, July 16th, 1969.  One small step for man, one giant cock in my behind.  Lyndon B. Johnson, March 31st, 1968.  I shall not seek, nor shall I accept, another term as your producer.  John F. Kennedy, January 20th, 1961.  Ask not what your producer can do for you, because it's nothing. 
[02:16:00]  Lincoln Roosevelt, March 4th, 1933.  There is nothing to fear but hard work.  Abraham Lincoln, June 1858.  A man divided against his own sexuality cannot stand, however he can kneel and grab his toes.  Patrick Henry, March 23rd, 1775.  Give me liberty or give me gum.  I'll say gum or both, but not just liberty.  Liberty is nice, but not without gum, it's not.  This has been a journey through time as seen through the eyes of Steve Carlisi. 
[02:16:30]  Ah, fucking bravo.  Ah, fucking bravo.  Fucking liberty.  Holy shit.  Fucking bravo, man.  Holy shit.  I take both.  Holy shit.  God damn it.  How the fuck is that funny?  Let's go to Steve C. 
[02:17:00]  Steve C, what's up?  Good morning, good turbos and assholes and TVC tubers.  Taking it in the shitter without any lubing.  Steve C on the line.  Steve.  Cocklings and ball gags and assholes that are tight.  I will be swallowing man juice all night.  Growing a goatee to hide my stretch marks. 
[02:17:30]  What the fuck?  Oh, wow.  Here's Steve C in the line.  Steve C.  Filting my head back and cargling semen.  Making my pregnant wife dress up like he-man.  Sucking your penis through my wedding ring.  These are a few of my favorites.  Oh, my God. 
[02:18:00]  Okay.  Don't be bringing spouses into it.  Yes.  That's where it gets unfun.  Yeah.  We happen to like his wife very much.  Yes.  We can't stand him.  Yes.  But we like his wife very much.  We happen to like her and want to just hug her and go, we're very sorry.  Yeah.  If she just gets rid of him, we could have a nice relationship.  Let's say hi to Steve C.  Steve C.  Thinking I'm a rock star when I'm big as a house is.  Dancing around in fat women's blouses.  Ouch. 
[02:18:30]  He did a fucking rock secret.  Let's go to Steve C.  Steve C.  Lesbian videos and huge fucking logos.  He doesn't even need the rest.  Nah.  Something with homos.  Yes.  Steve C.  Steve?  Yes, Steve.  There's pink socks and hard socks and multiple days off.  One more. 
[02:19:00]  Steve C., everyone.  Steve?  Steve C.  Hey.  Hey.  How you doing?  Yes.  Yes.  Nothing to pass over my partner, Dom.  Starring in websites like Meetspin.com.  Oh, when the poodle barks.  Oh, when the soup spills.  Oh, that would be broth.  When I'm feeling bad, I simply get some shit on my dick. 
[02:19:30]  And then I don't feel so sad.  Oh, shit.  Putting large things into my ass crack.  Sticky, gluey, come on my hairy back.  Oh, fuck. 
[02:20:00]  That poor fuck.  Let's say hi to Steve C.  Steve C., how are you, sir?  Convincing my wife that I do like her clit.  Explaining why my cock always smells like shit.  Oh, brushing my teeth with a used condom.  Holy shit, we got Steve C. on the line.  Oh, Steve.  This me? 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  Yes, Steve.  With cum on my lips and a dick between my hips.  I love a penis like Carina loves Venus.  It could be the end of the bit.  Yep.  I think that signals.  Oh, well.  That's the flair that gets shot up.  Oh, well.  That says the bit's over.  Oh, well.  Well, we were talking about...  Oh, the talent coach.  The talent coach.  Yeah.  Coming out, Nick Cannon.  Yes.  So, with the Super Bowl this weekend...  I joined Prep Burger.  I ate it. 
[02:21:00]  I ate it.  Yes.  Double.  Here's the talent coach Super Bowl bit.  With the Super Bowl this weekend, do the Super Bowl seduction.  This bit is great because it marries two things.  The Super Bowl and sex.  Oh, man.  Come on.  Everybody's going to love that.  And then the talent coach goes and has a component to move listeners from Friday show to Mondays.  Oh, yeah.  That's a big thing in radio.  You get your audience on Friday and then you make sure they're with you and join back up with you on Monday after the weekend. 
[02:21:30]  Ah, then you're bringing them over the weekend back to you.  Here's the bit, Anthony.  Yeah.  How does this work?  Find a bunch of women who hate sports to call you this Friday morning.  Mm-hmm.  Convince them to try and seduce their guy during Sunday's game to see which other guy chooses, the game or sex.  Oh, wow.  Play that out.  How is that good?  A real good girl would suck your dick during the game. 
[02:22:00]  During the halftime report.  Where you just watch the game and you get your dick sucked.  And if she's real good, she would do it in front of your relatives.  That's what I mean, yeah.  Because people have big Super Bowl parties.  Exactly.  How would this work?  Unless this lady's calling with your missing teeth and black eyes Monday morning.  Yeah.  This bit means two phone calls.  One woman goes, well, he went for the game.  And then the next one, well, he went for the sex.  And that's it. 
[02:22:30]  It's a two-answer thing.  You're right.  That really is it.  Then I have the women back on next Monday, yeah, the day after the game.  No kidding.  To see their rate of success and to get the story of how they did it.  Wow.  Is he going to do this, I wonder?  Probably not.  They won't let him do that.  Why?  It's regular radio.  You can't do fucking sex bits.  No, they'll make it nice and safe, like make whoopee.  No, whoopee.  Hey, did you make whoopee or did he watch the game?  We made whoopee.  Oh.  You mean he can't say finger pop? 
[02:23:00]  No.  He can't say fuck, finger pop, bang, dick, shitter, falking, falking, teabacking.  So that's that.  You don't have to spend much time on that fucking thing, huh?  I'm going to listen to the replay on that just to laugh my ass off.  I love that.  I think I missed a couple.  That's funny.  There's a bunch in there.  Oh, god damn.  Why don't we go to break?  Because when we get back...  Yes.  I forgot what we were going to do.  Whatever, we'll figure it out. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, another happy birthday to Captain Jimmy.  What?  They got another TV station.  Oh, good.  After the break.  Love these.  After the break, they got another TV station.  And I think we'll go to break with Bobo's Sex Calls.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking guys are making some great production pieces behind the scenes.  I mean, some great fucking production pieces.  That was a nice job by Danny on that last one.  Yeah.  I understand.  Absolutely.  Very funny.  All right.  This. 
[02:24:00]  I think we need new beds.  What?  Music beds.  Some cool stuff out there.  We got to, like, fucking juice this shit up a little bit.  Yeah.  Oscar nominations just announced out there in Hollywood.  I call it La La Land.  La La Land.  Holly weird.  Good God.  How about...  Anyway, best picture.  Tenfold Town.  They call it that, too.  Yes, Chip.  2010 Oscar nominations. 
[02:24:30]  Best picture.  Here you go.  Yeah.  Avatar.  No surprise there, right?  Now, this blind side, I hear, is a great movie.  Who's in that?  Isn't that Sandra Bullock?  Oh, she's supposed to be great in that.  With the football fucking player?  Oh.  God damn it, I haven't seen that movie.  District 9, I haven't seen that.  I thought that was a movie about the governor.  Blinds.  Thank you.  Thank you.  That's blind something else.  District 9, which you said you saw recently again. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah, I watched it the first time.  I was like, eh, it's a cool movie.  Whatever.  And then I watched it again, and I thought, that's pretty good.  It's a good movie.  It's a good movie, yeah, but not Oscar-worthy.  It's not Oscar material.  I'm definitely saying not Oscar-worthy, but better than I initially thought it was.  I don't let you guys off the hook that easily.  What?  You say it's good, but not worth the nomination.  All right, what would you put in District 9's place, then, as you see the movies here?  There's five movies.  There's one, actually.  Oh, how many?  Oh, my God.  How are all those movies nominated for Best Picture? 
[02:25:30]  So then we go, Hurt Locker is up for a nomination.  That's great.  Hurt Locker, definitely in there.  In Glorious Bastards?  You know what?  No.  I...  I didn't see it.  Is this for Best Picture, right?  Yes.  I don't think In Glorious Bastards was a Best Picture-worthy nominee movie.  It wasn't...  It was good.  It was entertaining, kind of slow in parts, though.  All right.  How about Precious? 
[02:26:00]  Jimmy saw Precious.  Obviously.  That's got Oscar all over it, right?  Yeah.  Maybe.  It's good, though, man.  It's a really good movie.  But I'll tell you, I told you, there's certain parts...  I wouldn't get a Best Picture because there's certain parts of the story at the end that  I felt were preaching too much to the audience, whereas it should have been done in the context  of the story.  So I wouldn't give that Best Picture, although I thought it was great.  I haven't seen a lot of these movies, man.  I know.  I got to see a few before the Oscars.  A Serious Man.  What the fuck is that about?  That's a Coen. 
[02:26:30]  That's a Coen flick, too.  Those guys know how to make a good flick, right?  Who's in A Serious Man?  I don't even know.  Steve Blatter.  He's a serious man, all right.  I would like to know what makes him laugh.  I don't know.  A Serious Man.  Mon.  Who's in that?  Wow.  We should just know this stuff.  Why don't we know this stuff?  We don't really have this.  Who the fuck's in A Serious Man?  What do you got, Dan? 
[02:27:00]  Any names there?  Michael Stolbarg?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Could you read the synopsis or the plot?  Sure.  What is this movie about?  A black comedy set in 1967 and centered on Larry Gopnik.  Wait, you can't make black comedies that center around 1967.  That's not nice.  Oh, no.  Black comedy means a comedy that is a little dark.  Oh, oh.  Not in that way.  Oh, I thought they'd put Benny Hill music to the fucking fire hoses.  No, no.  That's different. 
[02:27:30]  I'd see why it would be a friend Oscar for you.  Oh, I see.  Exactly.  But seeing a black comedy set in 1967, that's a little rough.  Do you know how mad people would be if you did that?  Oh, God.  Benny Hill music.  But know who has to do it.  Someone that has nothing to lose.  Like, James Cameron's at that point in his career.  Steven Spielberg.  Nothing to lose.  Just surprise everybody.  Mel Gibson could do it.  Fire hoses in 3D.  Fire hoses in 3D with Benny Hill music.  Just like, what the fuck?  Feel the experience in 3D. 
[02:28:00]  All right.  What else?  Let's see.  Centered around Larry Gopnik, a Midwestern professor who watches his life unravel when his wife prepares  to leave him because his inept brother won't move out of the house.  Holy shit.  Shit on a stick.  That just sounds boring.  And I like the Coen brothers.  Not anymore.  All right.  All right.  Who are we to say?  Then that movie Up.  Up.  Not to be confused with the other movie.  Up in the Air.  Up in the Air.  Which is nominated Up in the Air. 
[02:28:30]  Now, I haven't seen this load of crap.  Sure you have commercials from American Airlines in the Hilton?  Yes.  Yes, you have.  And speaking of that, my sister left a message on my machine there, and we have this relationship  where she listens to the show every morning, so hi to Terry in Orlando, Winter Park, and  that's how she knows I'm doing okay.  And then she leaves a little message on my machine, and I know she's doing okay.  We don't actually speak to each other live.  And she said that you guys, or Jimmy was right, that this Up in the Air was one big fucking 
[02:29:00]  commercial for the airline and for the hotel business.  It got nominated, and it's gotten so much praise.  Look, Clooney was decent, but Hollywood, this is how out of touch these fucking jizz bags  are.  They think that that's putting them in touch with the crisis of people being out of work.  That's their nod to the working class people.  Hey, we understand.  We're with you.  We're tributing you.  Just another self-congratulating shit heap.  Stupid wedding scene went nowhere. 
[02:29:30]  It went nowhere.  It was a meaningless aside.  It had nothing to do with the fucking film, right?  No.  And the scene where they're both pulling out, I know we've talked about this, they pull  out the cards.  I have the Black MX.  It's not a funny scene.  No.  I didn't hate the movie, but I didn't think it was Oscar worthy, as they say.  It was just an okay, I'll kill some time and watch this fucking thing.  Absolutely.  If I was on a plane watching it, I wouldn't want the plane to crash.  Right.  Oh, so, all right, getting back to what you guys said, what, District 9, you said, shouldn't 
[02:30:00]  be there, so, all right, put a movie in just District 9's place.  Well, let me tell you something, all those movies, by the way, are not, there isn't one  of these movies this year that is, holy shit, that's the Oscar winner.  Sorry, I don't see it.  I heard Crazy Heart was very good.  Colin said it was a little overrated.  I didn't see it.  But I have, I want to see An Education I have not seen.  That's in there?  Yes.  That was the movie I went to see when the fucking fire alarm with the smoke, so I don't 
[02:30:30]  know how the movie ended.  I have a copy of it at home.  It's a really good movie.  I liked it.  It's artsy.  It's one of those kind of, but I liked it a lot.  And Education was really good.  But I don't know how it ends, so give me your fucking copy so you can find out.  I'm coming over today.  No, I have to destroy my copy.  Destroy.  Did you guys put a movie in District 9's place, Ant?  Star Trek.  Did you say it?  I'm sorry.  No, I just said Star Trek.  Oh, 9? 
[02:31:00]  Star Trek was this year.  Yeah, it was great.  I finally saw it, and I liked it.  I put it in there.  I liked it a lot.  I mean, if it's a toss-up between Star Trek and District 9, I would probably go Star Trek.  You'd go Star Trek over District 9?  Yeah, I mean, look.  But those type of movies never get nominated.  I felt like District 9, it started off as like a concept film, and then they just forgot about  the concept halfway through.  Yeah, yeah.  And it just kind of like, it was nothing I haven't seen before.  I was like, all right, I see what this is.  It's an updated take on an old sort of fable, if you will, and it wasn't anything groundbreaking.  I think it was a weak year for movies. 
[02:31:30]  Most of those movies in the Best Picture category, eh.  Still good.  You got the precious Avatar.  Is it a great movie, or is it great technology?  It's going to win all the technology awards.  Is it one of those Oscar movies?  I don't think so.  But I guess it has to be nominated, because, you know.  I love it.  I don't see it.  Because it's groundbreaking, but.  You know how great it would be if they gave Best Special Effects to Precious?  Because when she fell down the steps, it really looked like she fell.  Yeah, and you got Avatar and Star Trek. 
[02:32:00]  Do you know how mad people would be?  Call them nerds.  And Kyle S. in Indiana.  Jimmy's right.  Ordinary people don't look like George Clooney.  It was just fucking.  Oh, Moon!  No?  Moon was.  Hold on, we got Coke Logic in on the Moon thing.  Not great.  Coke, what's up, brother?  Hey, what's going on?  Yeah, I was just going to say a movie that got completely snubbed.  Moon.  It's one of my favorite fucking movies of all time now. 
[02:32:30]  Moon?  I saw it, and I wanted to really fucking. . .  I wanted to like that movie, goddammit.  Dude, who wants to watch a movie about an ass hanging out a window?  Jesus.  Hope you did.  I did not see Moon.  I do want to see it.  I didn't even hear about this movie until very recently,  and then Ant brought it to the show's attention, and now I got to see it.  It got a little weird.  It was a little 2001-ish.  Yeah, I got to see it.  With sort of almost a Hal-like computer. . .  Problem is, though, I'm in no man's land, 
[02:33:00]  because there's a bunch of those movies I want to see,  but there's nowhere to see them.  They're out of theaters.  They're not on DVD.  They're not on my on-demand that I spend a lot of money on every fucking month.  Put some of these movies on the TV now that they're being nominated.  Moon is out on DVD.  Oh, it is.  Okay, maybe I'll pick that up.  I can Netflix Moon probably, right?  No.  Why the fuck not?  I don't know.  Maybe not on Instant, but . . .  What about fucking on-demand?  What am I paying for on-demand for?  No.  Give me my moon on-demand.  I didn't find it on-demand either.  What is that about? 
[02:33:30]  It's one of my favorite movies.  And here's something.  If I had to find it somewhere else.  Oh.  Oh.  Another electronic store.  Oh.  Oh.  You know.  Oh.  All right, Coke.  Let me go to Pete in Georgia.  He's got a little more on Serious Man.  Pete.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey.  Serious Man was the strangest movie I've ever seen in years, but also at the same time,  one of the funniest.  You've got to check it out.  Beef.  It's what's for dinner.  All right. 
[02:34:00]  I'm going to continue with my theme.  Where do I see Serious Man today?  Today.  Today.  I want to see it today.  Today.  Where do I go?  It's a little theater down here called BitTorrent, you know.  A little theater, yes.  Bravo for you.  Where do you see these movies, man?  Excuse me?  I want to see some of these movies.  He's not kidding.  I know.  You can definitely check them out at some theaters that are fun.  That's technology shit.  It's a theater near you. 
[02:34:30]  A theater really, really near you.  Piece of shit.  Somebody that didn't like Hurt Locker.  What?  Why?  You want to find out?  Yay!  Let's go to Jeff.  Sheikh Mohammed.  Oh, Jeff.  Hey, guys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Hey, man.  I was in Iraq.  I was in the Marines.  I went to Iraq twice.  Listen, my job was to go out before those EOD guys go out and, like, find the bombs that  they came out to do shit with.  Yeah. 
[02:35:00]  And the whole movie was just completely unrealistic.  Well, that doesn't mean...  Oh, my God.  Look, God bless you for your service, my friend.  But you're an idiot.  It isn't about if the movie's realistic or not.  There are plenty of movies that aren't realistic, but they're Oscar winners because they're, you  know, someone's vision or interpretation of it or something, I think the story was really  the story of this guy and how fucked up he was.  Punchline wasn't realistic about comedy, but that won an Oscar.  That was very realistic.  I saw that recently, Jimmy. 
[02:35:30]  Sally Field looked just like a stand-up comic.  Oh, see how realistic it was, and that just kind of ruined the whole thing for me.  See, you, it ruins the movie for you.  I understand that.  Whenever I see stupid radio movies, I think it's ridiculous, too.  Why don't people do that in real life?  Yeah, why?  Have just two complete conversations going on at the same time.  They kind of do.  You ever be at a party or something, and, like, you're almost in a set-up as a square, and  you're talking diagonal to people?  Do you think they do that?  Yeah. 
[02:36:00]  See, I was just kidding.  Like, I'd be talking to Danny.  And, I mean, Jimmy would talk.  I was just having to do that.  I mean, I certainly hope my theater is for 2009.  I was actually talking to you, too.  And I'm trying to see what I would put in the place.  I know, I've been looking at that, too.  And I can't really find anything besides that's going on right now.  I've been looking, too.  Well, I think there were a few good movies, but nothing Oscar were there, really.  I haven't really seen a lot of these, though.  I didn't really...  2009 wasn't really...  I actually like this movie year for me.  Why aren't you guys cross-talking?  We're in love.  Batting our eyes at each other.  Cross-talk.  Because we made our dumb point. 
[02:36:30]  I'm just like, I'm talking, and they're not.  I know.  But all of a sudden, it just turns into an inane conversation between me and Danny.  It could be any night at my house.  We didn't really feel like going with it, aren't we?  Exactly.  Man, we got lazy.  Matt Stanford, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  I'm going to connect.  Hey, Matt.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Matt.  How close are you to Rip Torn?  Rip Torn?  Yeah, he's in the fucking news.  That raging alcoholic.  Supposedly, he's going into rehab.  And hold on one second, Matt.  Rip Torn, so he gets out of jail. 
[02:37:00]  And in the paper today, they showed the bank and his house.  Yes.  And now I don't blame the guy.  I don't either.  Because the bank up there in this weird little town in Connecticut is in a house.  That is the dumbest bank I've ever seen.  It's a fucking old house.  That they turn into a bank.  Because you hear, holy shit, Rip Torn breaks a window and falls asleep in the middle of the bank thinking it's his house.  You're like, wow, that's pretty fucked up.  But then when you see the two pictures, his house and the bank, it's a mistake you could do.  How does that bank not get robbed all the time? 
[02:37:30]  It's a house.  It's a house.  It's a stupid house.  But now he's going into rehab.  And we said yesterday, leave the guy alone.  Rehab will kill that man.  Let him drink the rest of his years.  He needs the sauce.  Why?  Does he need it or does the family around him need it?  That's what it is.  Because he's quite happy just being a fucking lunatic drunk guy.  Yeah, breaking it up.  As long as it doesn't hurt anybody.  Matt.  Yeah, what's up?  Just going back to what you were saying yesterday about the Grammys and how awful rock music is over here in the U.S., I completely agree with you. 
[02:38:00]  I just think you've got to look to the U.K. for great rock music.  You guys, you know, heard you talking about Muse a few weeks ago.  Arctic Monkeys, they're playing a great band.  Man!  This isn't even a man thing.  Muse is fucking...  The U.K., man!  I like the Muse and the Arctic Monkeys are pretty cool.  Yeah, we should get Muse in the studio.  They're coming in soon.  Not bad music for Fag Nation?  I don't think Muse would do our show.  They sell out every time they come to New York.  They're coming to MSG.  I know.  I would love to get them in. 
[02:38:30]  I don't know if that's possible.  I'd love to have them play.  I don't think the show is sold out yet, though.  Oh, really?  Being honest, not.  Really?  All right.  Thank you, Matt.  All right.  Zombie Land?  Zombie Land isn't worth any kind of Oscar or anything.  It was a forgettable zombie movie.  Zombie movies these days got to be pretty fucking good.  There's a lot of goddamn zombie movies out there, and they have to be really good for  me to actually be entertained.  Yeah, and that one was just trying way too hard to be super bad with zombies. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Way too hard.  Exactly.  Oh, really?  Super bad with zombies.  They went so far as to cast a lead that looks like Michael Cera and kind of acted and had his  mannerisms and stuff to try to play off that whole vibe.  Yeah, I wasn't feeling it, yo.  You liked Superbad, obviously.  Yeah, Superbad, I think, is probably one of my favorite comedies.  Did you like Pineapple Express?  It was all right.  I'm going to watch that one again.  Not that.  Not like, holy shit funny.  I lost interest.  Too much action.  Like, Superbad is fucking genuinely funny.  Hilarious.  And there's not many spots where you're sitting there going, all right, that's not very 
[02:39:30]  funny.  Hilarious.  I'm getting bored with this.  Yeah.  I thought it was good.  Yeah, Zombie Land, not good.  Good zombie movies.  There's plenty of them.  I like that one with Ving Rhames.  God damn it, that's a good fucking...  The Dawn of the Dead remake.  Dawn of the Dead remake with Ving Rhames.  That's a good goddamn zombie movie.  Fucking running zombies.  Holy shit.  Yeah, I don't know why there's such a big beef with that.  I mean, it's just a whole...  It's just a different angle.  Like, why can't you just sit there and enjoy it?  I mean, I get where the purists are coming from, but can't you just have fun for a little 
[02:40:00]  fun with it?  When that bitch is backing that truck up and just smacking zombie faces against the  back of the truck.  That's the best.  Such a great clip.  When that guy throws the propane tank into the crowd.  Oh, that's a great scene.  And the shockwave, they just fly over.  And the end of that movie, when the credits are rolling, is...  I sat there while other people were leaving.  And I fucking...  I'm thinking, if you got up and left, you missed the whole end of the movie.  And a lot of people did.  When I went to see that in the theater, I think probably 75% of the theater got up and 
[02:40:30]  I always stayed past the credits.  And you sit there and realize, holy shit, they all fucking died.  Is it tough to get your girlfriend up?  They didn't even make it.  Same thing with Iron Man, too.  A lot of people left...  Oh, not Iron Man.  Not Iron Man.  She sleeps like...  Shit, and I'm getting confused between Iron Man and Wolverine.  It's like living with Sid Vicious.  Damn.  Is it Wolverine?  I think it might have been Wolverine.  Yeah.  I didn't dig Wolverine very much, but it was better than I thought it was going to be,  because all I heard was that it sucked.  Well, you got to see at least the Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury cameo.  Well, exactly.  And you can't lose with that. 
[02:41:00]  I've been with her a while.  I'm assuming there's some kind of love thing there.  I'm not sure.  I mean, my cock is so big.  Now we're done.  Tell me about it.  Now we're done listening to you.  Tell me about it.  I like...  Top five zombie...  What do we call that?  Crosstalk.  Crosstalk.  Okay.  I like Crosstalk.  How about...  Crosstalk.  Top five fucking...  Put it down on the sheet.  What's the hot fucking...  That's not a hot topic.  It's a fucking...  Talent coach fucking bit.  Yeah, that's a talent coach bit.  It's called Crosstalk.  Anthony, top five... 
[02:41:30]  But you gotta do this fast.  Yeah.  Top five zombie movies of all time and go...  Danny can help you.  Holy shit.  Danny can help you.  Danny can help you.  Gotta go with Night of the Living Dead.  Evil Dead.  You gotta go with the Dawn of the Dead remake.  Okay.  You gotta go with...  Can I do 28 Days Later?  28 Days Later.  Okay.  What about Rodriguez?  Rodriguez.  What about fucking...  What's the name?  The Umbrella Corp movie.  The first one.  I liked Resident Evil.  The first one.  It's all right.  I'll say eh, but... 
[02:42:00]  I gotta go with this one.  Which was?  Zombie?  It was good.  I don't know if you saw it.  It was called Zombie.  Yeah, it was different.  It was Italian.  You need one more.  You got Dawn of the Dead.  Dawn remake.  28 Days Later.  Zombie.  Well, I said the original Night of the Living Dead.  Yeah, well...  It's because you have to.  It's classic nostalgia.  You're almost obligated to put that fucker in there.  Even though, for the most part...  But you know what, though?  Sean.  Sean of the Dead.  Too many of the deads.  That's good.  You can't have all the movies of the dead.  Of the dead.  That's not fair. 
[02:42:30]  What about the Rodriguez movie with the...  I always forget the name of that fucking thing.  Oh, well, they were vampires.  Really.  What?  What?  The Dust Till Dawn?  No, the fucking one of that fucking...  With Quentin Tarantino.  Yeah, the one everyone forgets about.  The short film.  That was good.  I enjoyed Grindhouse.  Grindhouse.  I didn't even...  You never saw Grindhouse?  It's like two, three-hour movies.  I got the time for that shit.  They fucked up by doing it that way.  I know. 
[02:43:00]  It's such a commitment.  The two movies as individual movies, I think, work.  But you can't sit through the whole fucking thing.  Because that's what I want to do.  I see them on cable and stuff, but it's like, I don't want to watch one without watching the other.  No, no.  It doesn't matter.  So I want to watch both together.  They're two totally different movies.  That's why.  I want to get the whole vibe, though.  They fucked up with the concept.  They really did, because I think the movies on their own are pretty damn good.  I mean, I think it's interesting what they were doing.  Yeah.  I'd just rather see it the way it was intended.  Oh, Oscar nominations.  What else do we care about?  Best actor, best actress.  Director's always whatever. 
[02:43:30]  You want to see actor or actress?  Actor in a leading role.  Let's do actor.  Jeff Bridges for Crazy Heart.  Now, I saw fucking Crazy Heart.  Let me tell you, this movie's really good.  Slow, though.  No car crashes.  Well, one car crash.  Oh.  One little car crash.  That is the key to the entire movie and what makes him turn his life around.  But besides that...  George Clooney for Up in the Air.  Boo. 
[02:44:00]  Colin Firth for A Single Man.  What is that?  I have no fucking clue.  Is that a period piece?  A period.  Morgan Freeman for Invictus.  I'm sorry.  That's okay.  I stepped on you.  Morgan Freeman will not win that Oscar.  With his bad fucking Mandela accent.  Was it a bad accent?  Hell yeah, it was.  Yeah.  What else?  Jeremy...  Jeremy Renner for The Hurt Locker.  What else?  That's it?  That's all we got.  Then we got five? 
[02:44:30]  All right, so...  Jeff Bridges wins.  Holy shit, Jeff Bridges wins.  Jeff Bridges, you think?  Without a doubt.  They might fucking Morgan Freeman this thing up, yo.  They ain't gonna Morgan Freeman this shit up.  I don't care if it's Black History Month.  It ain't happening, man.  It ain't happening.  Let's go Best Actress and then we're done with this.  All right.  Best Actress in a Leading Role.  Sandra Bullock for I'm Caring for a Giant Black Kid.  That's the blind side, right? 
[02:45:00]  Helen Mirren for The Last Station.  That has to be a pair of...  What's that?  That's that Helen Mirren.  She's the...  I think she's the old broad with the nice bits.  She played the queen?  The nice tits, yeah.  The old broad with the nice tits?  I almost said bits.  Is that the way she's billed?  Yeah.  She's got a nice set on her.  I'm telling you.  Are you kidding me?  Fucking show me...  Google image her shit.  I'd suck at Helen Mirren's tits.  Google it.  Google it.  I've seen the nicest tits in Hollywood right here.  No, Helen Mirren, I've seen her.  As far as old broad, she's got the nicest tits in Hollywood. 
[02:45:30]  Google it.  Google it.  Google it.  Her pussy ain't bad either.  And I've had all the pussy in the world.  You know what that usually means.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.  Google it.  We don't have a little fucking Google image on the Helen Mirren?  Well, I'm going deep.  I see you're going deep, Mr. Skin.  What is the station about?  The station?  The last station.  I don't know.  This is going to be a period.  She's ready to die, maybe?  The last station in life? 
[02:46:00]  Oh.  She goes into an old age home?  A historical drama that illustrates Russian author Leo Tolstoy's struggle to balance fame  and wealth with his commitment to a life devoid of material things.  Ah, Tolstoy.  Wow.  Of course.  Boom.  All right.  There's a lot of Helen Mirren.  You don't think that sounds good, Hope?  Oh.  Are you fucking kidding me?  That sounds slow.  She gets nude in everything.  That's what I'm telling you.  This is the best kept secret in Hollywood.  You want to see young Helen Mirren or you want to see old Helen Mirren? 
[02:46:30]  No, I want old.  I want old.  She says she looks good old.  I want old.  I'll go back 10 years.  Is she being banged by a black gentleman?  Sure is.  What movie is this?  She fucking tweens her.  She rocked her tits.  Let me find some...  That was when...  By the way, if anyone...  Pele fucked her.  If anyone could send me Susan Sarandon's daughter's tit pic, I'd really appreciate it because  you can't find it online.  You got to watch Californication to see it, unfortunately.  You hear about this?  No.  Susan Sarandon's daughter is an actress. 
[02:47:00]  She's in Californication as a stripper.  Supposedly she has amazing, amazing boobs.  How come we ain't seeing Helen Mirren's fucking...  All right, let's start.  There's one of her heavy boobs right there and she's pretty old right there.  They're weighty, she's old.  They are nice.  They're weighty.  Huh, Jim?  That's probably in the 70s, 80s, though.  Early in the 70s.  That's 2003.  Oh, I'd suck those big fat tits.  They're heavy, too.  I'd suck her giant queen tits.  What do you think, Ian?  Oh, God.  What do you think?  Get the fuck out of here.  She's all right.  What do you think? 
[02:47:30]  Stop it.  She has hair like James Cameron, but I'd still suck her tits.  What do you think, Ian?  Come on.  No.  Slow down a little bit.  Those tits look like the fucking cartoon old lady in Playboy.  Man, you don't have a mom fetish.  What's wrong with you?  I certainly don't.  Look at her.  Behind the fruit bowl.  Yeah.  Big fucking pink nips.  She just loves breaking out her tits, though.  She should.  I told you.  Jimmy, would you go there?  Yeah, I'd fucking...  I'm not a fan of older women, but she has a good body for an older lady.  Oh, yeah.  I'd suck those big...  Baby powder.  ...pink-ended tits. 
[02:48:00]  Giant nips.  You take off your bra, you're hang.  Hang.  I'd suck those big eraser nips and lick her fucking giant yarmulke areolas.  There you are.  They look like moose noses.  Are these younger pictures of her?  Look at that big fucking bush.  Look at that giant fucking hair bush.  She was in Caligula.  Oh, that's right.  Was she really?  Mm-hmm.  Did she get fisted in that?  I don't think she was even naked in that.  She was very sexy.  That's available on Instant Netflix, by the way.  Let's go to the best actress. 
[02:48:30]  The actress.  She's the actress.  We can't talk Anthony into sucking on the big...  Well, there, in the old days...  Oh, she was tough.  If I could go back in a time machine.  Fucking ugly as all hell, but God, she's got some nice...  Look at those big, heavy fucking Caligula tits.  Who wouldn't suck those and make this noise?  That's the sound I make when I suck tits.  What a fucking weirdo. 
[02:49:00]  Fuckin' love you.  All right.  That's her?  In 69.  God damn it.  What movie is that from?  It's called Age of Consent.  Yeah.  You know what you're talking about.  Look at her oily...  Wow, nice fucking dumper.  Oh, yeah.  She's shitting in the ocean.  It's great.  But she already looked...  She already had old lady face, though.  Nah, not really.  She's looking kind of fucking...  Wow, look at that.  Damn, she's been in showbiz for a while, this bitch. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, this old bitch gets naked everywhere.  She's just a naked old bitch.  Ooh, she's a nice fucking muscled ass.  Nice shit.  Oof.  Look at that right there, huh?  Look at how muscled her ass is.  Playing in the coral.  I'd like to put my finger in her asshole and have her clench up and pull me across the  floor.  The only problem is you can't tell where the seaweed ends and her bush starts.  Yeah.  One underwater picture.  That is true.  Yeah.  That was a little scary.  There's fucking pilot fish attaching themselves to the beard.  And the winner is Urchin Twat. 
[02:50:00]  Fucking dopey pussy.  Take that fucking pussy and beat it.  Hey, where are we?  Best actress?  I'll tell you where we are in one fucking second.  Holy shit.  This is what I say today.  Oh, boy.  Susan Sarandon's daughter's fucking tits.  Where do you find that?  Fucking somebody on Twitter just sent them to me.  Well, we better see them then.  Click for NSFW. 
[02:50:30]  Here we go.  This is Susan Sarandon's fucking daughter's booze.  Well, Susan Sarandon had nice tits.  Wait a minute.  Look.  They're lopsided.  Yeah, when they're fucking large.  No, one is way ridiculously too big.  You with me or what, Jimmy?  That looks like a Photoshop.  That ain't no Photoshop.  That is ridiculously too big on one side.  Yeah, it really looks like the elephant man standing next to a regular guy.  I'd suck her tits, but one is a 38 double D and one is a fucking B minor. 
[02:51:00]  You know what?  You can even see in that picture, by the way.  Oh, my gosh.  With a broad look.  She's deformed.  And her fucking neck should be poking out of Loch Ness.  Jesus Christ.  She does have a long neck, doesn't she?  Holy shit.  Would you like some fruit?  We'll go get it off the tree.  Fucking God damn it.  Holy shit.  You know what?  You're right.  The right one.  I mean, I've never seen a right tit.  There's always one larger than the other one, but this is way out of the force.  It's like Texas and Rhode Island.  A right tit is crazy bigger.  All right, look.  Here's the deal. 
[02:51:30]  If I get 200 new followers in the next two minutes, I will fucking retweet this picture.  Aw, damn.  No, that's not nice.  You're getting in trouble.  That's not nice.  I ain't getting in no fucking trouble.  I'm going to retweet what Matt Radio sent me.  Was it a link?  I got a little link.  Link.  You're allowed to link, aren't you?  Link.  Come on, Danny.  I want to see her big lopsided tits.  I know.  Am I allowed to send that out or what?  I don't know.  I wouldn't send anything to this.  Listing tits.  Big giant.  She has like a club tit, like Dudley Moore.  She's kind of cute in the face, though. 
[02:52:00]  No, she has a great big tit, but the other one...  She has a nice big tit.  Yeah.  The other one, she spilled radiation on that just stayed the same size.  She had an accident in a lab.  She fucking sent her tit in a plum through a fucking gamma machine.  One of her tits is a big tit.  The other one looks like one of Susan Stranding's eyes.  Just a Google tit.  Just a tiny little nub.  Nice Garfield eye tit.  Yeah, I guess you're right.  Yeah, look at that.  Come on. 
[02:52:30]  God damn it.  What happened?  Why would she show those fucking things?  Why did the left one give up on growing?  Looks like Schwarzenegger and DeVito in Twins.  Yeah, there's a problem there.  That's not symmetrical.  Can we see her fucking long neck again, too?  We as humans love symmetry.  Oh, what about that?  When she's on all fours, though.  That banger.  One tit's scraping on the ground, the other one's fucking A cup.  Let's do Best Actress so we can move on.  Yes.  I have to see those fucking lopsided tits again. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, they're fantastic.  She always walks to the right.  Big long neck.  She does have a fucking gyraf neck.  It's fucking horrendous.  I bet you when she goes to Toys R Us, kids ask for her autograph.  Nice neck, dick.  Fuck, there you go.  Oh, look at that.  What the fuck, dude?  There's a big difference.  Jesus.  I gotta take a chance.  I'm retweeting this shit. 
[02:53:30]  Fuck it.  That is a big fucking fucking tit.  Yeah.  You have to choke her in sections.  I'm gonna choke you in quadrant B.  It's like one of her titties had a stroke.  Yeah, the other one's like...  Which one's better tit?  Which is the best...  Because they're both...  I like left tit.  They're both nice.  I like left tit.  I like left tit.  Like her left.  Yeah, the right one's starting to get a little long.  Yeah, it's getting long.  And the left one is easily a full C.  The right one's trying to crawl behind her.  Yeah, yeah.  It's going under her armpit. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, if she swings, that thing is going toward the back of her body.  She is pretty, though.  Yeah, she's an attractive goyle.  I wouldn't mind putting my meat plug between those fucking loppy tits.  Between those fucking uneven fun bags.  I wouldn't mind putting my fucking meat sausage in between those fucking lopsided udders.  Hey, could you wrap those fucking milk bags around my fucking sweaty pud? 
[02:54:30]  Unevenly distributed milk satchels.  Yeah.  Hey, seahorse neck.  Why don't you wrap those fucking seahorses forever.  And I got to thank Matty Radio, and I fucking retweeted that shit.  Opie Radio has it.  And I think someone just sent me a video, too.  You want to see the video?  Yeah.  Are you lying, fucking Gino?  Are you lying?  Gino better not be lying.  Where the fuck is this video you said you sent me?  What is she doing?  Gino, what is your fucking Twitter name?  Where am I at?  I'm not be lying, Gino. 
[02:55:00]  Where am I at?  I'm working on my Chicago accent.  Meat plug.  Yeah.  I like meat plug.  Stick my fucking...  I like the term meat plug.  Stick my fucking seed distributor.  Right between those fucking, those giant life givers.  All right, John Valby.  Jesus.  Hey, Lord.  Hey, Lord.  Yeah.  Blow potato flakes all over.  Yeah, that is really uneven.  I think he's lying.  I don't have a fucking video.  Fucking piece of shit.  Where's our best actress thing? 
[02:55:30]  Best actress.  Oh, you got the video.  This Californication, I gave up on it this year and I'm hearing it's a pretty good season.  I was all in for the first few.  You watch Californication yet?  No, I don't.  Pretty good show.  Don't mind it.  Why do Southeast Asian children just...  What happened?  They're all over my fucking room here.  Well...  This is retarded.  They only go to the...  They're probably trying to get adopted or something. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah, well, you know something?  Get the fuck out of my room.  Oh, my God.  I just picked my nose and all sorts of snot just fell out of it.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Ronnie and Fezzy will be fine with that in a little while.  I don't know where it fell.  Oh, boy.  Fezzy ain't gonna like that.  This video won't play.  Yeah, I see that.  Won't play?  All right, what's the best actress?  So you got the Helen Mirren.  Who's nominated every year, it seems like.  Carrie Mulligan from An Education.  Yeah, she was good.  What?  I'm telling you that.  Education's not for everybody, but it was a good movie.  If you want something a little different in your movie. 
[02:56:30]  Is that the fat broad from Precious?  Carrie?  Gabbert.  Oh, yes.  Yeah, it has to be.  Yes.  She played the...  Yeah.  She played the manatee.  And then there's fucking Julia and...  Julie and Julia.  Meryl Streep.  I'll write with her.  Who plays Julia Child and the lovely...  What an American institution.  Meryl Streep is as far as the Oscars go.  She's great.  Oh, she's fantastic.  She is fantastic.  Precious might win.  Fantastic as shit. 
[02:57:00]  But she's actually hurt.  The actress.  Yeah?  Yeah, she got hit with the...  The...  Bi-plane guns?  No.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Just so fucking wrong.  It's the same joke. 
[02:57:30]  It's just the same joke every fucking day.  It's just reworked differently.  This is literally Groundhog Day, this show.  The same fucking joke.  I was just going to go with a fat joke, but nothing's going to top that.  Jimmy, I got one for you from Covington Mad on Twitter.  He writes, I'd put my fuck stick between those cancer magnets.  Wow, that's a terrible name for them. 
[02:58:00]  Fucking hot.  Well, that ends that bit.  Oh, god damn.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, they're calling her, well, the real Dre on Twitter.  Susan Sarandon's daughter, he writes, old Tom Dempsey tits.  Hey, it ties in the Super Bowl.  Why not?  Of course.  Fuck, I didn't notice that the one was so much bigger.  Yeah, that was like, instantly. 
[02:58:30]  We know you ladies have one boob that's slightly bigger than the other, but this is off the charts.  And we try to, you know, as guys, you don't want the girl self-conscious about that, because  you do understand it just happens.  But something that bizarrely freakish would be very distracting.  Here's how it would sound if you were sucking her tits.  Yeah, my voice is going, hee-lee-lee-lee-lee-lee-lee-lee. 
[02:59:00]  That's how it should be.  Hee-lee-lee-lee-lee-lee-lee.  That's a little tit lick.  Yes.  And then a big one.  This mouthful.  You bite them and they just fucking bumble out between your teeth.  It's like a kid when you put a whole big buddy piece of gum in your mouth.  Yeah.  You ever do that? 
[02:59:30]  You put a whole pack of fucking hubba-bubba in your mouth as a kid?  Yeah.  You're just drooling sugar?  Yeah.  Ah, wonderful.  It's terrific.  That's like your kid equivalent to having a tit in your mouth.  And the other one's like a little piece of freshen up nibble liquid.  A little when someone splits a piece of dentine with you.  Thanks, thanks.  It's really helping.  Shut up.  Hey, we got Jimmy Schubert checking in.  Well, absolutely.  For this bit, can we just turn it into Jimmy Schubert?  Hi, Jimmy Schubert.  What's up?  Hello.  Hey.  Hi.  You. 
[03:00:00]  Joey from Long Island here.  I just want to stick my love dart between her milk bags.  I want to stick my love dart between her milk bags.  Love dart?  Sorry.  It's all right.  It's horrible.  And again, end of bit.  Thanks.  Is it wrong that I call my cock a childhood ruiner?  Jesus.  By plane guns.  I'm so sick of Maury's celebrity lookalike show. 
[03:00:30]  It's the same fucking assholes.  Oh, well.  Yeah, I'd fuck the one who looks like Britney.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, it actually does.  Oh, and the guy that comes out thinking he's Snoop Dogg.  And then Maury's fucking dancing with fake Elvis.  Motherfucker.  Oh, God.  All right.  It's on a future show.  We don't get to see it now.  Oh.  It's just.  I don't know why.  Pick me back up. 
[03:01:00]  I don't know why, man.  Can we take a break now?  Yes.  We could do that.  That way we could get that out of the way.  I have to tell you.  What's the count there, Dan?  We got a lot left.  All right.  I don't know.  I'm going to fucking retweet the Susan Sarandon daughter picture.  I don't know what happened.  I got to do it again.  People are yelling, screaming at me here.  Those boobs are uneven, right?  It looks like one's giant and the other one's like small as can be. 
[03:01:30]  Exactly.  That's exactly it.  Suck them, though.  Oh, who's that dancing in that video?  That's her.  That's her?  Yeah.  Well, where's the fucking nakedness?  They don't show the nakedness.  Look at that.  Look at what the fucking strippers are wearing as panties, though.  Look at that.  Seriously.  It's like a spider web.  She has nice gams.  What's going on there?  She has nice legs.  She's height.  David Duchovny is too much.  Wow, she has a really long neck, like you were saying. 
[03:02:00]  Dude, it's fucking awful.  Holy shit, I didn't realize.  Yeah.  Another stripper's dancing on her neck as she's on the pole.  Yeah.  Very interesting.  All right, fuck sticks.  I retweeted it.  She should be standing in Dubai with that neck.  David Duchovny bangs too many hot chicks in this.  Because, again, to me, a sex addict is like fucking...  He just comes off as a devil-may-care guy who just bangs hot girls.  Yeah.  There's no, like, wanting to blow his brains out or fucking... 
[03:02:30]  Not that I've seen.  Not, like, bad addiction kind of thing.  It's just, hey, look at me.  I'm fucking girls and enjoying it.  Yeah, hot chicks.  You see that video of the kid that falls in the train race?  Oh, you gotta love that.  Hey, a quick break.  We got the happy birthday to Captain Jimmy.  I wanna...  Ooh!  Yeah.  Whoa!  After the break, all right?  Jesus Christ!  Holy shit!  I know.  With that shirt, it's terrible.  We're watching, I guess, Maury, and some guy's got, like, a tumor on his face that is beyond  anything I've ever seen. 
[03:03:00]  Way worse than half-hulk face.  Oh, half-hulk face is fucking Brad Pitt.  And this thing.  Oh, and this, yeah, the midget.  Midget with no legs giving birth.  No leg midget giving birth.  Just a fucking big fucking workout ball.  Welcome to the Maury Freak Show!  It's a workout ball with a head.  Terrific.  Have fun with that.  Her vag must be a mess, though, from dragging it on the floor.  Dragging it on the ground.  Imagine dragging your dick on the ground all the time, whatever it looks like.  You would just leave us a snail trail. 
[03:03:30]  You'd be cumming all day long.  Can we go to break?  Yes, please.  I wanna see some of this.  Kisses.  And Mom had sex with Son Knightley.  We'll try to get to that in just a bit.  I wanna say fuck you to Bob Kelly.  I know this is coming out of left field, but...  Fuck Bob Kelly.  For another reason.  I think he's doing a show with Jimmy, right?  The Comedy Central thing?  What's the big plug on that as I find the email?  It's actually this Saturday. 
[03:04:00]  It's called Comics Anonymous.  It's funny, I was sober 23 years yesterday, so it's just sober guys.  Oh my god!  Congratulations.  Yeah, I forgot, yeah.  That's terrific.  Me, Bobby, Mike DiStefano, and Rich Voss.  It's not affiliated with any program or any institution.  It's just four sober guys.  Just four quitters.  Four queer quitters.  Four people that couldn't fucking...  Cut the mustard.  Yeah, hang out.  Be cool like the rest of the boys.  Go to SillyAddicts.com, I think, to get free tickets.  They will email you a confirmation.  It's the same woman who does my HBO shows. 
[03:04:30]  She's very good.  You have to send some information, but it is a free show.  Taping for Comedy Central this Saturday here in New York.  Ready for the fuck you part of this whole thing?  Sure.  Yeah, what's the deal?  I got an email yesterday.  Let me read it.  Dad!  Hello.  I'm filming a TV show here in New York for Comedy Central this coming Saturday.  Excuse me.  I wanted to invite some of my favorite people to the show.  I will be me, Jim Norton, Rich Voss.  This is how it reads.  Can I read it along with you on my phone? 
[03:05:00]  I don't think you're one of his favorite people.  Really?  So there's a few things.  Let me see if you want to see, because that's the point I'm getting at.  Instead of writing me a personal email, I'm part of a mass email of favorite people.  As was I.  Oh, so you're in on this.  As was everybody.  Well, fuck you, Bob Kelly.  Exactly.  That's not how you do favorite people emails.  That's what I say.  So it says, I want to invite some of my favorite people to the show.  I will be me, Jim Norton, Rich Voss, and Mike DiStefano. 
[03:05:30]  If you would like to go, all the info on how to get on the VIP list is below.  And then it says, hello.  Below is the VIP confirmation.  As I said, this confirmation information is purely sent as an FYI for Bob Kelly's favorite people.  Hello.  I am filming a TV show here in New York for Comedy Central this coming Saturday.  I wanted to invite some of my favorite people to the show.  I will be, I will be me, Jim Norton.  See, it's the same.  Dude, I got it. 
[03:06:00]  It's a mass email to all of Bob Kelly's favorite people.  That's not how you do favorite people emails.  You take the time and you personally invite everybody separately.  Exactly.  And he's not even smart enough to blind CC this motherfucker.  No, look.  It's all fucking CC's everywhere.  We are part, and I are part of about 20 to 25 favorite people.  That's nice.  And I hate when people do this because you can now just like tap on this and get the fucking,  like, okay, look.  I don't have Colin Quinn's email address. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, guess what, Bobby?  Now I got Colin Quinn's email address.  Yeah, guess what?  I don't want everyone having my fucking email address, Bobby.  Create new contact.  Colin Quinn.  There's his email address.  Done.  There.  Now I'm going to email Colin something stupid.  You know what?  And tell him you wouldn't have gotten this if it wasn't for Bob Kelly's irresponsible emailing.  Yep.  What is Colin's email address?  That's right there.  Don't you see him in the blind CC?  Does it start with a B or no?  It starts with a P.  Paulie. 
[03:07:00]  Oh, no, no.  Where did he get that one?  I don't know.  I got to ask Colin Quinn.  That's a good one because, oh, okay, I know where he got it.  Why?  I'm not going to say it, but I know where he got it.  It's from a movie.  The movie Paulie?  Was he in Paulie?  No, no, just don't say the second one word because then people would get it.  No, I don't get it.  It's from.  No, I don't have it.  It's from. 
[03:07:30]  I can't hear you.  What?  You're whispering.  What?  Oh.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  We'll do charades.  We'll do charades.  We'll do charades.  Okay.  You're safe!  Oh, no, no, no.  No?  Safe?  Big tits?  Susan Sarandon's daughter's tits?  No?  Tits, boobs, Susan Sarandon, eyeballs, boobies, one bigger than the other, hefty, saggy, uplifting, 
[03:08:00]  A-OK nipple, big boob, breast, tit, monster.  Oh, my God.  What?  I suck at charades.  Holy shit.  I suck at charades.  Susan Sarandon's daughter, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Nipple.  Nipple is good.  No, no.  Nipple's bad? 
[03:08:30]  You don't like nipples.  You hate girls.  Why do you hate girls?  Thumbs up to the hate girls.  Why do you hate girls?  No.  What?  The tit.  All right.  What about the tit?  Mm?  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Thumbs up on the tit.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Thumbs down on the other tit.  Right good, left bad.  Right one, left bad.  Right is right, left is wrong?  I can't play this for real.  Oh, my God.  I can't play this for real.  I can't play this. 
[03:09:00]  I suck it.  I suck it all.  Let's have family time and play one of these dumb games.  I'm not that guy.  I hate family fucking fun.  A breast, a tit, a bad tit, a rotting tit.  Yeah?  What part?  All right.  A bad tit.  Good tit.  Bad, good.  Good, bad.  Good equals...  What?  Just stop.  Do you get it?  Okay, okay, okay.  Oh, the good... 
[03:09:30]  Ah!  Good, bad.  And then...  No, no.  But you're going too fast!  Just stop when you say one word!  I got good.  Yeah!  I got the bad.  No!  I already know it.  Good, bad, ugly?  Oh, no.  Fuck.  Okay.  I was with that, too, Danny.  Hmm?  Good tit.  Okay.  Two tits.  Oh.  Two words. 
[03:10:00]  Oh, two words.  First word.  I told you I suck it!  He puts two fingers up and I go...  Two tits.  Two words.  All right, two words.  We can start there.  First word.  First word.  But you're not supposed to talk.  I know.  All right, first word.  Thumbs up is the first word.  Fonzie!  Fonzie!  His name is Pauly Happy Days.  Pauly Fonzarelli.  Well...  It's Fonzie.  It's Fonzie.  No!  Okay, Fonzie what?  No, no, no. 
[03:10:30]  All right.  First...  First word.  Thumbs up.  Okay.  Thumbs okay.  Thumbs up.  Hitchhiking!  He's the hitchhiker!  First word is good.  All right.  Good clap.  Good applause.  Shut up!  Good hands.  He works for Allstate.  Good hands, yes.  Anthony is gesturing around like an ass.  He's the good ass.  Me, you, everyone.  Two.  Two words.  Two syllables.  Two syllables on the second word. 
[03:11:00]  No, no, no.  It's...  You're gesturing.  Second word?  Right.  Second word.  Okay.  Me, you, Danny, Jimmy.  In a helicopter.  He's smirking over his head.  We're flying...  We're the president.  We're flying in the presidential helicopter.  People...  People are actually going...  This is going to be the funniest thing ever from Cody in Indiana.  He goes, I want to tell Opie what it is, and I'm listening to it on the radio. 
[03:11:30]  I know.  People are like, charades on the radio.  This is brilliant.  I've looked around the room enough to know what it is now.  Well, that's what movie his email address is from.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't...  Yeah.  Remember that's...  That was kind of something.  Do you know how obvious this is?  Yeah.  Was it obvious, Jimmy?  No, no, no.  What he's saying now.  Yeah.  Oh, I just...  I'll do impressions while you guys are doing this. 
[03:12:00]  Holy shit.  Christopher Walken.  The guy you know from the movies.  Wow.  That's really good.  Yeah.  He does these impersonations.  I swear, you would think it was the real people.  I do everyone.  Who else you do?  Whoever you want.  Onus is on you, my friend.  You name him, I do him.  That's my motto.  The onus is on you.  Well, we're never going to get to your happy birthday.  Come on.  I want to hear the happy birthday.  Yeah.  The birthday's happy.  This is...  That is so bad. 
[03:12:30]  It's a good walk-in.  You hate it because you can't do it.  Oh, yeah.  You're right.  I thought it was kind of good.  Yeah.  Oh!  I carried this iPhone in my butt.  That's a hell of a butt you got there.  It should.  Captain Jimmy was wished a happy birthday on a little local news program out of Toronto,  I think this one is.  Toronto.  Ooh.  Out of Canada.  We got a series of these.  Oh, Canada.  You want to hear this?  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go. 
[03:13:00]  First, happy birthday to you.  We've got some great ones to celebrate.  Celebrating on February 1st.  I think Jimmy's celebrating birthday today.  Yeah, Captain Jimmy Nordenberger, we're told, it's his birthday, if you know Captain Jimmy.  43 years old.  Happy birthday to Steve, Sammy, Greg, Chip, Tony, and Uncle Paul.  That's a great one with Captain Jimmy.  Chip, Tony, and Uncle Paul.  How did they fall for Captain Jimmy at Sullenberg with...  Chip, Tony, and Uncle Paul. 
[03:13:30]  It's Jimmy and Sully Sullenberg.  Oh, Steve, Sammy, Greg, I didn't hear that stuff together.  And it's morphed.  Yeah, it's like a morphed picture of Jimmy and Captain Sullenberger.  He's got the mustache and the gray hair.  Look at you.  That is hilarious.  Oh, how did they fucking not fall?  I mean, how did they fall for that?  Wow, that's great.  That woman looks like Jim Norton.  It's President Clinton.  I did not have sex with that woman. 
[03:14:00]  Wow.  It's never good when you've got to tell everybody.  That's Bill Clinton.  You guys know who it was.  That's the...  Yeah, of course.  You didn't have to say that.  That's the number one rule of doing voices.  You never say who you're doing it.  I did not have sex with that woman.  No.  Is that Steve?  Beat that dead fucking giant horse.  Beat that dead Clydesdale.  Beat that dead otter. 
[03:14:30]  I'm trying to think of a gay animal.  I can't see.  Yeah, well, I was trying to think of a fat one.  I want to hit Steve on the back and watch his mouth open and eat a marble.  Get that picture up on our door with the other...  Hungry, hungry, homo.  With the other pictures on our door.  Hey, uh...  Curry Sweets.  K-E-R-R-I Sweets. 
[03:15:00]  A teen bombshell, according to the janitor in New York City.  What?  Curry Sweets.  What do we got on this?  Are we supposed to look her up?  I think so.  All right.  Let's rock a little Curry Sweets.  Let's go to this.  Curry Sweets.  Curry Sweets.  Uh, with an eye.  I get a bunch of...  What?  With an eye.  Oh, fuck me.  I got a bunch of goddamn cupcakes.  Ooh.  I love cupcakes. 
[03:15:30]  Shit.  Really?  It's Harry.  K-A-R-I.  Holy mother shit.  God damn it.  Holy fuck!  Hottest girl I've ever seen in my life.  God damn it.  Dude, look at the picture I got.  Look at the picture I got.  Look at the picture I got.  Look at the picture I got.  Oh, that's perfect for you.  I see her.  Danny, where is she?  All right.  How old is this fucking girl?  This is trouble.  She's nine.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to be jerking off to...  What?  Wait, why does Danny got naked pictures of her?  I don't know.  That's impossible. 
[03:16:00]  Why?  Go to the one with the fucking legs up in the air.  Yeah.  Supposedly a teen bombshell, but the pictures we're seeing is a little different.  Yeah.  That must be...  The naked...  Oh, my...  Oh, my God.  God damn.  I am just...  Don't...  No one call me.  No one try to get in touch with me.  I will be jerking off the entire afternoon.  Thank you.  The girl is very lovely.  Whoa!  Um, uh, uh, uh, Sly Stallone. 
[03:16:30]  I did not have sex with that woman.  Oh, you want Sly?  Babe, you're going to have to get a lot of body bags if that girl's coming to town.  Boo!  Boo!  That was funny.  He's a hungry, hungry home.  So you want to do, uh... 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, she's just some fucking internet porn girl, right?  All right.  Yes.  She's on my site.  She's a cam girl.  Do you guys want mom has sex with son nightly or middle-aged people are now sexting?  Nobody wants to hear about old people sexting.  Sexting?  LOL, laying on the linoleum.  Now we got to do it.  I hear some horrendous fucking sound bites in this.  Ah, shit. 
[03:17:30]  Debbie Nigro is 52 and started getting sext messages a couple years ago.  The world is becoming ageless.  And there is no expiration date on sexy.  You know, there just isn't.  Nigro...  All right, slow the fuck down.  Hold on.  Right now I'm looking at Carrie Sweets.  Right.  And, um...  And we were looking at Helen Mirren a little while ago.  Yeah, yeah.  So there's your comparison for today.  Yeah, exactly.  There is an expiration date.  Yes, it's 10.  Wow, holy shit. 
[03:18:00]  That girl's fantastic.  Nobody wants to read old people's dirty texts.  I'm getting this fucking...  Oh, God.  I'm so wet.  Are you turned on?  No, my diaper, I mean.  Oh, your pussy's so wet.  That's because I'm on my stomach and I shit into it.  Ah, shit. 
[03:18:30]  Debbie Negro.  N-I-G-R-O her name is.  Or is it Nigro?  Debbie Nigro.  The first way you said it best.  The world is becoming...  She says that with so many out there, sexting is becoming more popular.  Yeah.  It's not ageless.  Of course it's not.  What do you mean by that?  What do they say to each other?  God.  Oh, I'm going to fuck you until your capillaries burst.  Oh, harder.  Break my hip with that big cock.  Oh, I'm so hard in my arteries. 
[03:19:00]  Oh, your pussy's as smooth as a velvet inside lining of a coffin.  Did you do ROFL?  Really old fucking lady.  Justin's liver.  And boogie from Virginia, OMG equals ouch my gallbladder.  This isn't.  Nigro helped create a group for divorced women and says with so many out there, sexting is becoming a lot more popular.  Women in particular are crashing that middle-aged stereotype. 
[03:19:30]  And divorce, being what it is in this country right now, has half the population back out dating again at a very much older age than they'd ever imagined.  She says it's more common than you think, since folks don't run around talking about it.  The only difference between being 50 and sexting and being 20 and sexting is you need reading glasses to see what the heck they're saying.  Yeah, I'd like to gray sock her.  That's the only difference, really?  I want to stick it in your ass. 
[03:20:00]  Your cock, no, suppository.  Her 22-year-old daughter is all for it.  I think that's fabulous.  I think that age is just a number, and I think everyone's a person, even if they're a mom, and everyone deserves to have fun.  I don't want to see or hear the text, but I know that she's having fun, and that's okay with me.  The inside of mom's panties look like someone stepped on a piece of lemon freshen-up.  Just a fucking sickly yellow goo. 
[03:20:30]  Her fucking bloomers.  The inside of her panties, it looks like the Brontosaurus sneeze in Jurassic Park.  It's just a horrible discolored goo.  Oh, fuck, man.  L-M-A-O from Kevin from Connecticut.  Lick my aged ovaries.  Don't I have ovaries?  Well, yeah.  Those things are gone.  I know.  Exactly.  All the plumbing is trying to squeeze them together here.  Oh, it's awful.  That's good.  They can put on the pornos and where her uterus used to be. 
[03:21:00]  It's her vaginoply, a DVD holder.  Pinches her nipple, and the DVDs come out.  Let's say hi to Mike in New York City.  He knows a little bit about this middle-aged sex thing.  Mike?  Come on.  Guys, she's right.  The world is becoming ageless, okay?  We got cougars at 50 years old, and I'm 30, that I see every day that I bang on the spot.  You got Hershel Walker beating up mid-20-year-old guys in MMA fighting.  So, in a way, I think she's right.  You know, older people are doing the same thing younger people are doing.  Sex thing. 
[03:21:30]  Whatever you want to call it.  I think she has some truth to it.  There's no truth to it.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, her vagina looks like when you hold a sugar cube out to a horse.  You guys wouldn't bang Kim Cattrall?  No!  Oh, get the fuck out of here.  Dude, I wouldn't fuck her for fucking...  I wouldn't fuck her with your dick!  Yeah!  Oh, Kim Cattrall's fucking dick.  Are you a fan of this show, for real?  Come on, of course.  Of course.  We beat the shit out of Kim Cattrall.  Fuck no.  I wouldn't mind an older woman, but not Kim Cattrall. 
[03:22:00]  No fucking way.  She's not the least bit hot.  Dude, never saw that.  No.  Okay, Vivica Fox.  You wouldn't bang Vivica Fox.  She's 46.  She's black, so ants out.  I would...  Yeah, I would do...  Yeah, sure.  Why not?  Sure, why not?  You wouldn't sex...  Texter, sexter either?  You know what I'm saying?  But black don't crack!  Nobody wants to talk dirty to an old lady.  Oh, I just want to push your knee-high stockings back.  And fucking lube up your vagina with desitin. 
[03:22:30]  Fucking...  Oh, here's an LOL for you.  Thank you, sir.  Chris in Jersey's got an LOL.  Chris?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hi, buddy.  LOL.  Largely open labia.  Well, okay, gravity.  Mother Chuck and Joe.  Right on, brother.  Vivian Fox is hot.  I mean, we're looking at glamour shots online.  Yeah, but I'm fucking...  You know something? 
[03:23:00]  Compared to this fucking chick I'm looking at here.  Don't even try.  Dr. Bonnie Eaker-Weil is a relationship counselor and author of Makeup, Don't Break Up.  She says responsible sexting is great.  I just think it's wonderful because, you know, with the economy the way it is now...  You're not supposed to when you're driving, though, so if they sext, they might crash their  little rascal.  Or their sexting and the little rascal goes down a flight of steps.  Like in a Victorian mansion.  The old hag.  Yeah.  Exactly.  You can text it to her.  You old hag. 
[03:23:30]  And then push her down the steps.  You know what I do to squealers?  LOL.  Footer.  Yo, pleasantries, boys.  Pleasant.  Hey, um...  Insecting is for the young, bro.  Anybody over 40, they should just call it yucking.  Yucking.  Very good.  All right, punch it out.  Bye.  There's a difference.  I want you to make my cock wet with Efferdent.  Yeah.  Oh, quick.  Spit out your Freedent and eat my pussy. 
[03:24:00]  People are so stressed out.  They don't have money.  The new going out is staying in.  So you want to build up that crescendo and that novelty and excitement.  And this is giving them a big buzz.  Go down on her.  You look like C. Everett Coop.  A big buzz.  You know what it gives her a big buzz?  When the orderly overly medicates her so she can't get up and complain.  She just urinates while he's fucking her. 
[03:24:30]  Gives her a big buzz.  Gives her two Tylenol PMs.  And then sodomizes her.  Videotapes it on his fucking iPhone.  Ah, fuck it.  Sophia Loren, enough.  For an older lady, she's pretty.  No, no, no.  For a wax figure, she's pretty.  She's bony and all fucking melting.  How old is Sophia Loren?  480.  Sophia Loren is out now, man.  As an older broad, she was good up until... 
[03:25:00]  She's 74?  Oh, fuck that.  I would say, as an older broad, she made it to 60 as far as thinking you would go there.  If she was laying on her back...  74, hell fucking no.  Would you sit on her face and let her eat her ass?  I'd let Sophia Loren eat my ass.  I don't give a shit.  Why not?  I'd like to get on my hands and knees and as she's eating my ass, she has to look under  and just see my stomach and tits hanging.  And realize that's what her life's come to.  Oh, no.  Back up one.  Oh, jeez.  There's a problem.  Who's that?  Talking about Lopsided.  There you go. 
[03:25:30]  Susan Sarandon.  Their daughter right above her.  Sharon Stone.  Yeah, I'd fuck Sharon Stone.  Who's that?  She looked good in a casino.  That's Sigourney.  Yeah, it's still fuck Sigourney.  Star of Avatar.  Who's that?  Who's that fan?  Oh, Raquel Welsh.  Raquel Welsh.  Raquel fucking hung in there for a long time, too.  Yeah, I'd grab her hips in there.  She hung in there.  Jane Seymour.  That's an old picture of Jane Seymour.  Never with that Jane Seymour. 
[03:26:00]  Telling my mom she can't have an autograph.  Go fuck yourself.  Mary Steenburgen.  I'd fuck her.  Oh, get out of here.  Never.  Look at those big fat tits.  I'd stick the big red log that Doc made to make the train go faster  and Back to the Future 3 right up her asshole.  You really would put your meat sock in between those beauties?  I would gladly fucking stick the old hepatitis dispenser  right between those fucking fat Hollywood udders.  I want to suck them.  Make big noise sucking big tits. 
[03:26:30]  There you go.  There's the Helen Mirren.  Is that her?  Get the fucking big boobs through the dress.  Wow.  Yeah, right?  She loves showing off.  She likes her boobs.  Oh, who's that whore?  That's Jean Smart.  Oh, yeah.  Smart.  What was she designing?  Oh, Fran Drescher.  Oh, Christ.  Go back to Fran Drescher.  What did she fucking condition her hair with?  Dishwater?  Fucking stringy-haired idiot.  Her hair is awful.  It's stringy.  Hey, fucking, hey, moist spaghetti hair. 
[03:27:00]  It's horrible.  She has split ends in her scalp.  Her hair is al dente.  It's fucking, oh.  Oh, my, you want to see the way?  Did my mother make French Drescher hair?  Oh, my mother make a good sauce out of her hair.  Oh, that's fucking Susan Loogie.  Oh, yeah.  Did you ever find her attractive?  Never.  I let her jerk me off with her muscular arms.  Very muscular.  Yeah.  You get an armpit fucker.  She has arms like Michael Irvin.  I let her jerk me off.  She has, like, wide receiver arms. 
[03:27:30]  Who's next?  Joan Jett?  Joan Jett looks like a man.  Yeah.  Is she 50 now?  I'd fuck Joan Jett.  She had a good ass in Crimson and Clover.  Yeah, how long ago was that?  Exactly.  That thing's gone.  What about Andy McDowell?  Yeah, Star of Groundhog Day.  Yeah.  That's appropriate for today?  Yeah.  She's annoying.  I'd pinch her tits.  Madonna?  Fuck no.  Madonna, go away.  Madonna, you're nuts, dude.  Get the fuck out of here with those goddamn ligaments and the Botox face. 
[03:28:00]  Dude, did you see the fucking shoot she did for whatever the magazine was?  What year are we looking?  No, recently.  No way.  Was that Kim Basin?  Yeah, it's the fucker.  If that's what she looks like, yeah, definitely.  She's not looking bad there.  Fuck no.  Never.  Holly Hunter.  Never was hot.  51?  Yeah, for 51, she looks good.  Jesus.  Who's this elephant?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  That's Jennifer Tilly?  Yeah, she got fat.  Oh, wow.  Whoops.  Wow, she did.  Jesus.  She was fucking sexy for a long time.  I'd still fuck her just because she's Jennifer Tilly. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  And her last name is awful.  All those big tits.  Jacqueline Smith.  Oh, my God.  That's Jacqueline Smith?  Yeah, she's had a lot of work.  Jacqueline?  Yeah, Jesus.  She's 63 years old.  She looks great.  Wow.  I'd like to fuck the divot in her throat, though.  I bet you all that skin is piled around the back of her neck like a Sharpay.  Like if you're fucking a doggy style, it's probably like a bunch of skin and a scrunchie.  Oh, yeah.  Ellen Barkin.  I'd fuck her in a second.  Fucking, yeah.  She was always fucking 55. 
[03:29:00]  Jessica Lange is 60.  No way.  Bye-bye.  And that's it.  I'd let Jessica Lange lick my balls while I jerked off.  Wow, what a guy.  Then I'd go over her role.  I like how you'd allow her to do that.  Then I'd just talk about her role in Kong.  After a fucking bike workout, though, Jimmy.  Yeah.  And the bike workout.  My fucking balls.  After a spinning class.  My balls are horrid after a fucking workout.  Two little soft milk-dud fucking horror shows.  Old Sour Bag. 
[03:29:30]  Oh, God.  What the fuck is going on?  I hate the Maury Freak show.  Rene Russo?  Yeah.  Better than it was, I guess.  But fuck.  Rene Russo.  Can we go home now?  Yeah, let's wrap.  Let's wrap for the day.  How do I go home?  Daddy has to tinkle.  Ah, this picture of fucking.  I got a picture of that Carrie Sweets girl up here that is fucking the best picture of 
[03:30:00]  her I've seen.  It's the one where she's laying.  She's got her one leg bent.  She's laying on her stomach.  She's got a little thongy on and those little striped socklets thingies.  Any picture will do.  What the fuck?  She is fucking smoking.  Yeah, there's something going on there.  Ah!  She's not like, oh my God, incredible best girl I've ever seen, but man.  She's lovely.  Who?  You can lap that.  Oh, yeah.  You can lap that.  Yeah, that guy gets fucking instant feedback of the day, whoever the fuck that was. 
[03:30:30]  I'll do Samuel Jackson.  Good one.  The girl on that website!  You're not supposed to say what you're doing.  It's just like him.  That girl got snakes near a plane!  But that makes no sense.  Fucking hate bed and prejudice.  They just have to tie it in with something that's local.  Yeah.  Or something newsworthy.  You know?  Oh, my God. 
[03:31:00]  Why did they give the guy golf clubs?  Who knows?  He's got one eye.  Probably so he can give it to girls when he hits on them.  I can just smash his face.  I'm going to ask you out.  Pick one of these to reject me with.  He had a giant tumor on his face.  He certainly did.  The whole left side of his face.  What would you say it looks like?  It was just airbrushed out.  Yeah, yeah.  It looks like you put him on Photoshop, but didn't do a good job.  You just kind of used the clone tool and picked one color. 
[03:31:30]  Oh, my God.  All right, let's think about this Wendy Williams for a second.  Something's going on with her.  I like a big take.  Don't you start fucking digging her.  Looking a little better.  No.  A little better.  No!  Dude, I'd fuck Wendy Williams.  A little better.  What?  I really would.  I'd rather fuck Andy Williams.  I am not into her at all.  Or Bernie Williams.  At least you can play the guitar while you lick his asshole.  Stupid Bernie Williams.  Here we go.  This dumb guitar.  Let's go.  All right, we're out of here.  Guy's got something funny going on a break, I would assume, and blah, blah, blah. 
[03:32:00]  See you tomorrow.  See you in the A.M.  Yes, same bad time.  Shut up.  Bye-bye. </pre>
