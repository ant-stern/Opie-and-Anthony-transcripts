<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a chaotic and highly vulgar affair.  It began with the hosts recounting a confrontation with a building employee after they were caught sitting on a ledge outside, observing women.  Their sarcastic responses and subsequent actions were detailed.  The conversation then shifted to Bill Clinton, focusing on a photo depicting him seemingly staring at a woman's breasts at a wedding. Listener calls added further anecdotes about Clinton's behavior and current financial endeavors.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to illegally playing multiple tracks from the unreleased Stone Temple Pilots album, *Shangri-La-Dee-Da*.  This led to listener calls and eventually calls from the record label.  Interspersed with the music were several listener calls, one detailing a workplace injury involving a severely injured caller's friend who was injured while zipping up his pants, and another discussing a lottery winner who nearly lost his $46 million prize due to mailing the ticket instead of delivering it in person.

The impending arrival of Ron Jeremy was repeatedly mentioned, generating both anticipation and negative reactions from some callers.  Comedian Richard Jeni, initially kept waiting outside the studio, experienced verbal abuse from the hosts, leading to him hanging up in frustration. After a debate about whether to let him on air, Jeni eventually arrived in the studio.  The discussion meandered through various topics, including Jeni’s upcoming performances,  the hosts' interactions with other comedians (Jim Norton, Andrew Dice Clay, and Ron Jeremy), and presidential scandals.  A lengthy and explicit discussion about pornography ensued, involving detailed descriptions and vulgar humor.  A caller, "Stalker Patty," a 46-year-old virgin, then called in and became the focus of a highly suggestive bit with the hosts and Ron Jeremy, culminating in Ron Jeremy touching her breasts and buttocks.  This segment also included numerous "FU Friday" calls featuring highly offensive and vulgar language.

The show continued with a discussion of dating and sexual experiences, filled with explicit language and humor.  The focus shifted to Ron Jeremy, who discussed his films, including one featuring an 87-year-old woman, and the physical challenges of maintaining an erection in such circumstances. He also shared his perspectives on male and female sexual responses.  The focus again returned to Stalker Patty, with the hosts and Ron Jeremy engaging in explicit jokes and propositions. A stunt involving Patty blindfolded and retrieving U2 concert tickets from Ron Jeremy's pants resulted in further direct physical contact.  This event was extensively described, along with the hosts' and guests' commentary.  The anticipation of online photos and videos of this event was repeatedly mentioned.  This segment included Jim Norton and Richard Jeni in the studio, along with additional "FU Friday" calls and a commercial for "Ultimate V," a sexual enhancement product.

The remaining segment focused heavily on sex, pornography, and Ron Jeremy's experiences in the adult film industry.  The conversation included detailed descriptions of sexual acts, Ron Jeremy's sexual techniques, discussions of penis size, and anecdotes about his interactions with performers, particularly Patty, whose explicit photoshoot with Ron Jeremy was discussed at length, with promises that the pictures and videos would be available online.  The show continued with listener calls featuring similarly crude and sexually explicit content, alongside the "F.U. Friday" segment.  Jim Norton's and other upcoming comedy shows were briefly mentioned. The broadcast concluded with a song from the Stone Temple Pilots album.  Throughout the entire broadcast, the high volume of listener calls and constant interruptions contributed to its chaotic nature.

[00:01:00]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Toll free, 877-692-1027.  Yes!  Friday!  Friday!  Friday!  Friday!  Friday!  Your balls are showing!  Marijuana is the bomb! 
[00:01:30]  Oh, ah!  Oh, ah!  Sweet, miserable crap!  Let's go while we're young!  Whoa, calm down, home!  Cancel your appointments!  You're my daughter!  Get on your hands and knees like a dog!

Horn, Aoyah laughing! 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, thanks, Dad!  You just have to see me.  Help!  Wharf!  Well you don't!  You don't think I'm big.  Yeah, thanks, dude.  You look like I'm a rat.  It's in the hole.  What the hell were you thinking?  Time to be bad.  Well, well, well.  Hey, everybody, we're all going to get late.  You get your bitch ass back in the kitchen and make me some pie. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, Billy.  It's a narcotic, medically and legally.  It never did anybody any good.  And does everybody a lot of harm.  You should go lose it.  Okay, terrific.  Ah, what's up, Anthony?  Ah, Friday.  Friday!  Nice.  Big F you to the guy that works for this building that told us to get off the ledge  as we were checking out chicks outside the building.  Off the ledge?  What an a-hole.  What ledge were you on?  Ben, get on the mic. 
[00:03:00]  What happened?  On days like today, we go sightseeing.  We leave the office before the show, kind of, you know, get our heads together by gawking  at girls outside the building.  And we have this special place.  We sit on the ledge.  You know what I'm talking about, right?  Right out by the Brooklyn Diner out front.  Right.  And a nice ledge there.  Girls walking right behind the sidewalk.  We are enjoying ourselves.  We're not bothering anyone.  You made it sound like a ledge of a building.  This is like the part where the stairs come up.  Yeah.  And you're just kind of sitting.  Four feet off the ground, Anthony. 
[00:03:30]  Right.  Guy comes out like he has nothing better to do and starts bitching and complaining and  tells us to get off the ledge.  Why?  We weren't bothering any.  We don't even know.  Maybe he thinks we're going to, like, injure ourselves sitting on the ledge.  Very injured.  I fell and lost my shoes.  What did you...  Did you go F yourself?  Yeah.  Oh, did.  Oh, yeah.  What'd you say?  Yeah, I couldn't imagine you going, okay, sir.  No, then...  I'm off your ledge.  You know me.  Yeah.  How obsessive I can be.  Nasty mother F.  Then for the next 15 minutes, it just ruined my afternoon. 
[00:04:00]  I had to keep talking about it over and over and over again.  Did you stay on the ledge?  No.  Oh, pussies.  Come on.  No, so then we just stood where we were.  Like, all right, we jumped off the ledge, so now we're standing.  Yeah.  And we put all our coffee and our lunches and stuff right on the ledge.  Yeah.  So what's the difference?  We're still loitering.  Why did you listen to him?  I even tried to bribe him.  I'm like, dude, I'll get you some t-shirts, some stuff from upstairs.  But what was he going to do to you?  I don't know.  Dude, what could he do to you?  I bitched and complained and stuff, you know. 
[00:04:30]  They do this in New York all the time.  Yeah, we've had this happen before, me and I hope.  The best one is there's a guy, his whole job, where is that, 50...  That's 50th and Broadway.  50th and Broadway.  It's Ben's girlfriend's building.  Yeah.  And they have a really big courtyard, okay, with a lot of flower pots and stuff, so there's  a lot of ledges.  These ledges are only, what, two feet off the ground, Ben?  Nothing.  And they're all squares.  Yeah.  And with flowers in the middle.  You got the picture.  Sure.  There's got to be about nine to 12 of them right outside the building. 
[00:05:00]  Great place to sit.  There is a guy.  If you want to be thoroughly entertained, it's across the street from Starbucks, right, Ben?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's right there.  It's right by where Mars 2112 is, it's right down, it's right there.  There's a guy, his whole job on a day like today is to chase people off these little two-foot  ledges.  He goes from square to square to square to square.  We ought to have like a lottery or a bingo game or something like that where we get a few  people, sit them down, the first person to get booted off wins a prize. 
[00:05:30]  It's not a bad idea.  Just all sit down at the same time and wait to see who he comes to first.  It would make a great can of camera because we could set it up where we just get a bunch  of our listeners and they keep sitting.  They just keep sitting and sitting.  But this guy, he will spend, we were there a half hour, 40 minutes just drinking coffee,  doing the same thing, gawking at girls.  We have a few nice spots to do this all over the city.  When the weather gets nice, the sights are out.  Yeah.  And we were hanging out there for like 30 or 40 minutes and this is all the guy did.  Just chase people away. 
[00:06:00]  Over and over and over again.  Typical example is somebody that just gets crapped on all day.  So he's got a crap on someone.  It's just the crap chain.  It's just people that have to justify their jobs for some reason.  Yeah.  I mean, we weren't bothering anyone today.  We were minding our own business.  Everyone loves a little bit of power.  So if your boss gives you crap, then you have to go out and give someone else crap.  Right.  So it makes them feel good.  All right.  Huh.  People.  So there you go. 
[00:06:30]  This is the first FU of the day.  It is FU Friday.  Humans.  We do have an FU Friday line.  Yeah.  How could the folks in Philly get to that?  WNEW.com?  Yeah.  Go to WNEW.com.  And yeah, we play messages from the FU line all day long.  Gee, I wonder what the most of them will be from Philly.  FU to you guys.  Well, we can handle that.  We play the Clinton bit to start the show.  Where's the post?  Where's the post?  Front page of the post today is just a hilarious picture.  I love this guy. 
[00:07:00]  He's whoring himself out.  He's just freaking...  No, more than that, though.  Look at the picture they got of Clinton on the front page of the post.  Oh, my God.  He's looking right at the girls' cans.  Clinton admires the sights at a local wedding during his money-making UK junket.  Yeah.  For the folks that don't have the paper, yeah.  His eyes are just focused right on this blonde's boobies.  She's wearing a little halter top thingy.  And she's well endowed.  And I do believe that's a nip right there.  And he's just gazing right down.  They got the perfect shot. 
[00:07:30]  You know what?  He might have looked right at our eyes for every second of this.  That's what I was telling Sandy on the way to the train.  And that's why I think this is hilarious.  He was probably behaving himself at this wedding.  And then, just like any other guy, because I told Sandy this morning, guys do this all the time,  you're going to take a peek, you know?  But the camera guys, you know, they're just like,  taking thousands of pictures of the president.  Hoping he looks down.  And there's the one they caught.  And there it is on the front page of the paper today.  They make it look like he was just gawking the entire time at the wedding. 
[00:08:00]  I want to know what Timothy McVeigh is doing behind him.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  Looky, looky here.  Bubba.  Isn't that funny, though?  He's looking right at our cans.  You've got to love Clinton, man.  He was the best.  I'm so bored with George W.  It's not the excitement and fun that we had with the president, like when we had Clinton in there.  Thank God we had eight years of him.  Right.  Oh, you know, someone knows the ledge guy we were just talking about. 
[00:08:30]  Tony.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, boys.  Hey, bite me.  I haven't been on every show, just yours.  All right.  What's up, Tony?  I know who you're talking about.  Not exactly him, but when we used to do construction, they're like wannabe rent-a-cops.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Call him Dudley Douche-Rite.  He'll flip.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Break his chops.  All right.  We'll do it.  Send all listeners out there.  There's some hot women walking by.  All right, Tony.  Thank you.  Later, fellas.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, okay.  Jay's going to correct us. 
[00:09:00]  Jay says the clip on the news of Clinton at this wedding?  Yeah.  It was one of those prime time lives, one of those news programs.  They had just a quick thing on it, and they showed Clinton walking up to the couple.  His eyes didn't leave her chest the whole time.  The whole time.  That photographer didn't get lucky.  He could have taken ten shots.  They all would have looked exactly the same.  Then I stand corrected.  I mean, the girl has a nice set.  That's obvious.  Oh, yeah.  She was cute.  She was cute.  That's funny. 
[00:09:30]  All right.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Mark in line, too, is saying that Clinton wasn't even invited to the wedding.  Mark.  Look, he's Clinton.  He can go wherever the hell he wants.  Who's going to tell him he can't show off?  That's true.  What's up, Mark?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, it was on the news the other night.  They were having this wedding at, like, this country club.  And along comes Clinton riding up on a golf cart.  He's playing around the golf, and then he rides right into the wedding.  Hi.  What is it?  So he gets out, and they're all calling him over, and he's taking pictures with everybody  and, you know, signing autographs and everything. 
[00:10:00]  And gawking at boobs.  That's classic.  I go to country club, and she sure puts the cunch in country club.  Yeah.  Take care.  Movie deal now.  All right.  I'm going to lead the Macarena now, everybody.  Come on.  Come on.  No, give me sunglasses.  I want to do the kick line for New York, New York.  Let's go.  The chicken dance.  Hey, you guys want to get in trouble?  Why?  What do we got?  We haven't been in trouble lately.  Take those old records off the shelves.  Come on.  I'll lead the conga line into the kitchen, everybody.  I'll have the chicken. 
[00:10:30]  Do you want to?  I just have a mix master bill.  I just have to ask if you guys want to get in trouble.  What?  Okay.  What are you doing?  Well, don't you think we should be the first radio show in America to play tracks off the  brand new Stone Temple Pilot CD?  Oh, no.  Not this.  Oh, not this again.  All right.  What station might be promo?  I guess everyone.  Yeah.  Upcoming STP album.  Yeah, we got it. 
[00:11:00]  And a lot of people probably saying when they're going to premiere the song.  This is highly illegal.  How long will it take before they shut us down?  Five minutes?  The cease and desist?  Turn off all the fax machines because that's how they usually get us.  I'm serious.  Turn off the fax machines.  Yeah, yeah.  We cannot receive a cease and desist.  Oh, they are?  Yeah.  A week from tonight?  Yeah.  STP will be at Jones Beach a week from tonight.  Can we get ticks?  I want to go. 
[00:11:30]  Call Steve.  We have the latest CD, Shangri-La-Di-Di.  Nice.  And what do you want to hear, Ben?  Coma rocks.  You want to hear Coma?  All right.  Let's see how long it takes for the record company to get us with a cease and desist.  We love cease and desist.  All right.  Lock the doors.  Turn off the fax machines.  Turn off all cell phones as we check out some tracks from the latest CD from Stone Temple  Pilots until we get in trouble.  All right.  Steve, we got the brand new STP.  Oh, I know. 
[00:12:00]  So did I.  Let's see how long it takes.  Wait.  Are you guys playing a copy or are you guys playing the real thing?  The real thing.  Have you?  Okay, good.  All right.  We're going to play Coma to start.  No, Tim Sabian did not give us this CD.  Who was the connection here?  Don't tell me, but I mean.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Okay.  Uh-oh.  The hotline's ringing already.  We better start the song.  Stone Temple Pilots.  We're going to play Coma on the CD that's not even out yet. 
[00:12:30]  Nice.  The latest from the Stone Temple Pilots off Shangri-La-Di-Da.  That's Coma.  Nice.  Right, Anthony?  Shangri-La-Di-Da.  Yeah.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's go to Bluto.  Bluto, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  To all the record producers, I am putting it on Napster as we speak.  Oops.  F you, guys.  All right, man.  Bye.  Bye. 
[00:13:00]  Tim, what's going on?  Yo, that rock, man.  You want to hear one more track?  We did a big F you out of Philly.  Why?  Ah, F them.  Ah, they've been pretty cool so far.  Yeah, they've been all right.  All right, man.  The first day was rough, but ever since that, kind of coming around.  Yeah, long-time listener.  All right, thank you.  Over and out, Diamond Dust.  Thank you, Tim.  You guys want to hear one more track before we move on with our show?  Yeah, might as well get it out of the way before they tell us we can't play anymore.  Nice.  Yes, nice.  All right, this is the first track from the new Stone Temple Pilots CD. 
[00:13:30]  Dumb Love.  Ah, first time on the radio, Anthony.  Another track from the brand-new Stone Temple Pilots CD.  Um...  You don't like Dumb Love?  Anything yet?  Huh?  No cease and desist yet?  Not yet.  But all the bosses left for the weekend.  No one's here.  No one's here.  Ah!  That was pretty good.  You like that one? 
[00:14:00]  I always got to kind of get into it a few times, though, you know.  I'm not one of those.  It's very rare I hear a song the first time, and I'm like, yeah, cool.  Yeah.  Sal, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  You guys shouldn't even be talking.  Just keep playing the whole thing until somebody comes breaking the doors down.  That CD friggin' rocks.  All right, we can play another track.  Right on, dude.  All right, man.  Thanks.  It's not a bad idea, right?  No, no.  Dude, we're going to get screwed, man.  Why?  We're promoting the brand-new Stone Temple Pilot CD. 
[00:14:30]  Mm-hmm.  Opie and Anthony, we play the rock first.  We do?  Yes, we do.  When did that start?  When we get it before anyone else.  What happened?  Uh-oh, there's some...  All right, we'll take care of some business.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  What does that mean, Ben?  Huh?  Yeah.  Ben's going to slow him down a little bit.  I think something's happening.  Well, let's check out another track, Anthony.  Oh, no.  The latest Stone Temple Pilot CD.  This is Hollywood Bitch. 
[00:15:00]  Nice.  Yes.  The latest from the Stone Temple Pilots.  That's Hollywood Bitch off the new CD, Anthony.  And how are things going outside?  Ben's back in the studio.  Ben?  We're dealing with it.  What do you mean?  How's the wife and kids type thing?  Oh, I'm down the hall a little.  How's your house in the Hamptons?  You never get through three songs without the call coming. 
[00:15:30]  Atlantic Records have called.  Yeah.  They're dealing with it down the hall right now.  Uh, Chris, what's going on?  Hey, man.  You guys rock, man.  And that's an excellent CD.  And I can't wait to go see them in Jones Beach.  And also, I got a big F for Richie.  Why?  He's just a clown.  I work with him all day.  He's a clown.  All right, man.  Thanks, Chris.  You guys are the best.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Let's go to Vinny.  Vinny, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Do that rock.  Hey, Philly, there's your rock and roll for you. 
[00:16:00]  Love that.  All right, fellas.  I'm going to go listen to Anthony.  Call me to say hi to the guys at Texaco.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Now I'm not going to say it.  No?  No.  Liam, what's going on?  Hey, F and A, O and A.  Hey.  Punch out, Maverick.  Why?  You guys are in trouble again.  No.  They'll understand.  We're trying to promote the brand new Stone Temple Pilot CD.  Oh, it's rocking, man.  It's rocking. 
[00:16:30]  All right, man.  We just did a threefer.  Yeah, we did a threefer.  Thank you.  Let's go to Joe, who's next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Isn't it four for Fridays on NAW now?  Four for Fridays.  It's four for Fridays.  It's push your luck Friday.  Well, it's funny you would say that, Joe.  Let's check out Wonderful.  Oh, no.  Come on.  What are you doing?  Another track from the Stone Temple Pilot CD.  What?  What?  The CD comes out next week. 
[00:17:00]  This is wonderful.  I see the hot one.  Brand new SDP on the Opie and Anthony show.  What do you think, Anthony?  Nice.  What's wrong?  You all right over there?  Yeah.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We got our hands on a copy of the brand new Stone Temple Pilot CD.  Yeah.  It's out next week, officially.  Mm-hmm.  We're playing a lot of tracks from this thing right now.  Well, almost all of them. 
[00:17:30]  That's wonderful on the Opie and Anthony show.  Nice little ballad.  Yes.  It's not even the real CD.  Yeah, I know.  No, it's the real CD.  Shut up.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I'd like to thank you because the radio concert that is next Friday is at the Rock Station in New York.  Right.  And they won't admit that Stone Temple Pilots is going to be there.  So they've been rumoring about it like a bunch of fags.  Oh, no.  I thought everyone knew that Stone Temple Pilots will be at Jones Beach next Friday night.  No, no.  They say, oh, they might be there, this and that. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  I thought that was general knowledge.  That's it.  Didn't the bass player tell us on a plane?  Yeah.  I ran into him last night and he told me.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  Yeah, no problem, guys.  Bye.  Ouch.  I thought everyone knew that already.  Oh, brother.  Is that another scoop for the Opie and Anthony show?  Can't we just shut up sometimes?  What?  I really thought everyone knew, Anthony.  Should we take a break?  Why, we haven't done anything yet. 
[00:18:30]  What do you mean?  We talked about Clinton.  We talked about the Ledge Police.  And we've played four or five tracks with the new Stone Temple Pilots CD.  That's a good start to a radio show.  Someone on Instant Feedback says, yeah, Skip from New Rochelle, you guys actually figured  out a way to get in trouble without opening your mouth.  Well, we figure we should be the first ones to play Stone Temple Pilots on the radio.  Well, we also have other things today.  Ron Jeremy coming in? 
[00:19:00]  Ron Jeremy's coming in.  Jim Norton's coming in.  Porn legend, Ron Jeremy.  Is Bill Walton calling in today?  Not Bill Walton.  No.  All right.  And Richard Jenny in studio.  Yes, after we razzed him a little bit yesterday, late in the show.  Let's go to Earl.  Black Earl.  Earl, what's up?  Yo, guys.  We're on our way out to the train when we looked on the other station, and they're suddenly  playing the single.  Oh, they're playing the Stone Temple Pilots single.  Well, all the rock stations are playing that. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  I mean, we could give another track here, another deep cut from the new Stone Temple Pilots CD.  And we might have another surprise later on involving the Stone Temple Pilots for our listeners.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Look at Earl with a tease.  Would that be tickets to the Jones Beach Show next Friday night?  Well, they might be able to get their hands on the CD before you can buy it.  Oh, nice.  All right, Earl.  Thank you.  All righty.  All right.  Earl's heading to the Tradewinds for another WOW sticker stop today. 
[00:20:00]  That's 1331 Ocean Boulevard, Seabright, New Jersey, with Earl and the gang.  They'll be there, I don't know, in a half hour or so.  Why is WYSP calling us now?  I don't know.  And why is Rick getting paged now?  Who's paging you?  Somebody in D.C.  So what?  D.C.?  Oh, no.  Who's in D.C.?  Well, our PD ain't here.  Oh, we better play another track. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, no.  Come on.  It already got us to D.C.  Hey, we're in trouble already.  We might as well keep going until they officially tell us to stop.  Who wants to hear the single over and over again?  Every rock station's playing that.  I could just hear the meeting right now.  Another track off the brand new Stone Temple Pilots CD, Anthony.  This is Black Again.  You're hearing it first on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Brand new Stone Temple Pilots on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:21:00]  That's a track called Black Again.  Nice.  Things heating up.  What?  That's half the new CD that's not available until next week, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  We've heard Dumb Love, Days of the Week, Coma, Hollywood Bitch, Wonderful, and Black Again.  Very good.  Nice little taste.  We still have to play Hello, It's Late, Too Cool, Queenie, Regeneration, Bipolar Bear, 
[00:21:30]  Transmissions from a Lonely Room, A Song for Sleeping, and Long Way Home.  Maybe we can get to those at some point.  Yeah, we'll take a break here.  All right.  It would be very smart if we would take a break here.  All right?  Yeah.  And we'll see you guys at the Stone Temple Pilot Show next Friday at Jones Beach.  Can't wait for that.  See you. 
[00:22:00]  And we'll be back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie, Anthony.  Opie, Anthony.  Opie, Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Anthony Optimum Online.

[00:23:30]  Opie and Anthony.  1027-WNEW.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Hello.  Toll free, 877-692-1027.  I got to clear something up.  A bunch of people just bitching.  Why?  Saying we're playing too many commercials.  I got to explain this to you.  If we go 45 minutes straight with talking, we got to make up the time. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, that means we missed one commercial break.  So then we got to play extra commercials to catch up, as they call it in the business.  Right.  They all got to fit nicely into an hour.  We're supposed to talk for only 20 minutes at a time, then play commercials, do that like two or three times an hour.  Yeah.  But we just talked for like 45, almost 50 minutes straight.  No, we didn't talk.  STP talk.  Right.  But that's what is going on.  A lot of people think because we got syndicated that we're now playing more commercials. 
[00:24:30]  It's not true.  No.  Not true at all.  Come on.  Let's go to Brian.  Brian, what's going on today?  Hello.  Hey, Brian.  What's up?  What's up, buddy?  It's Brian from South Jersey.  I know.  All right.  A buddy of mine went to work this morning.  I guess he was doing his business in the laboratory.  He pulled a zipper up and got his pipe caught in his pants.  Oh, God.  They called 911, and they had to ambulance him out of there because he was bleeding so bad. 
[00:25:00]  There's no BS.  And I want you guys to say hi to him in the hospital.  He's a huge fan of the show.  His name is Billy Ho.  Hey, Billy.  What's up, man?  You know when you really zip up, if you're in a hurry, and you really zip up fast?  No!  That could do some damage.  Yeah, definitely.  What part of it got stuck?  He didn't get into it too much, but he said it's like the main vein on the bottom.  Ouch.  But, yeah, you guys suck, and that's stinky.  All right, Brian.  Thank you.  Thanks, man. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, my God.  Man, man, man, man.  That's horrible.  I think everyone's done that at least once.  Not badly, if you're lucky, but you just get a piece of it sometimes.  Oh, zip it back down, but get in the hole underside like that.  All right, baby.  Thank you.  Thank you, Sandy Kane.  Oh, man.  All right.  On the way, Ron Jeremy in the studio, Richard Jenny.  I think Jim Norton's stopping by.  Yeah.  And you were bitching and complaining in the office. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, I heard a story on 1010 Wins on the way in on the news station that they found this winner of the lottery here in New York.  It was like a, how much money did the guy win?  Forty six million.  Forty six million bucks.  Somebody wins.  The prize goes unclaimed.  If you don't claim it in a year, that ticket's just nothing.  It's done.  Yeah, and all the news stations were doing stories on it when the day came up that, you know, it was a year. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  The date.  That it expired.  And everyone's like, well, it's over.  This guy, whoever he is, just lost out on forty six million dollars because he didn't claim his prize within a year.  It was June 9th, I believe the date was, that it expired.  And it was bought on last year.  So it turns out this guy mailed the ticket in to the lottery office.  And it was postmarked June 7th.  So he got it in two days before it expired.  And this guy mailed the ticket in. 
[00:27:00]  It's a forty six million dollar ticket.  He mailed it regular mail.  Like not even registered mail or anything.  He put it in an envelope, slapped the stamp on it and mailed it.  Oh, my God.  And I'm listening going, what is so important in this guy's life that he couldn't walk the ticket down to the office?  I would have walked with an armed guard.  Exactly. Armed guards.  I would have had a limo near you.  What could you possibly be doing that you couldn't walk it down there or have it driven in an armored car down to the place? 
[00:27:30]  And then you just read about this guy.  Maybe he, you know, he didn't want to take a day off from work or something.  A day off?  Wouldn't you make a day of it?  I got a forty six million dollar lottery ticket.  I'm making a day of it.  You're going to trust it in the mail?  You know what happens to the mail?  Well, sometimes it just gets crunched up or a truck will start on fire.  Anything could happen.  And it's forty six million bucks. 
[00:28:00]  And the guy decided he was too busy one day to maybe take the day and drive it down to the office.  He busted out the thirty three cents for a stamp and mailed it in.  The what's the guy's name?  Melvin.  Melvin.  His name is Melvin.  Melvin B. Milligan.  Melvin B. Milligan.  I'm a computer programmer.  I work in computers.  And I'm the big lottery winner. 
[00:28:30]  But I can't make it down.  I have to upgrade my hard drive to a SCSI.  I was very busy that day.  I couldn't couldn't take the time off.  So I I mailed it in.  I was hoping this the letter would have just gotten crunched.  What kind of idiot mails it in?  Too bad the stamp didn't fall off.  I something that returned to sender or something like it got sent back. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, my, I didn't put enough postage on my envelope.  And he waits a year.  Forty six million dollars.  Does he have an explanation why he waited a year?  No.  He just.  Oh, I had some lottery tickets in the drawer.  I just kind of threw it in there.  Yeah, I heard something on Wednesday.  They had a little clip from the guy.  He said he didn't even know he had the ticket until I could came up in the news that, you  know, blah, blah, blah, that the date is drawing near. 
[00:29:30]  So he kind of went through his junk draw, pulled out a ticket.  He knew it was back there somewhere.  I looked at it and went, oh, this is it.  I'd love to bring it down, but I have to go to Comp USA and buy some more RAM.  Very busy.  Tim, what's going on?  Guys, what's up?  Hey.  Yeah, Anthony, he wouldn't have gotten it.  He would have gotten it back because it's 34 cents for a stamp now.  But, you know, we won't hop on that.  Well, too bad it wasn't he didn't put 33 on it.  If I open that envelope, I'll tell you guys I wouldn't be here right now. 
[00:30:00]  I'd be on the beach.  I'd go, buddy, split it 50-50, and see you later, pal.  50-50?  100% for me.  Me, me, me, me, me.  Spread the wealth, Opie.  Come on, man.  We need a Lexus like you had, you know?  It's like, you lose, I win.  You were stupid, I'm not.  The mentality.  I'm taking a $48 million lottery ticket.  I win, you lose.  What is it, a dollar for certified mail?  Yeah.  Not even.  That guy's a jerk.  What do you expect?  Look at his picture.  He was told it was a winning ticket, but not for how much it was.  Oh, come on, guys.  Every time the lotto was like a million dollars and I'm playing it, the first thing I do Sunday 
[00:30:30]  morning is whip out the tickets.  No, so what do you mean they told him it was a winner, but they didn't tell him how much?  I guess he went down to a lotto representative, ran it through the machine, and he was told,  hey, you got a winner here, but I'm not sure how much it's for.  Which means it's for a lot of money.  You know, even if it's for a couple of grand, you don't put it in an envelope and just mail  it.  Bring it down.  It's right in Jersey somewhere.  What a tool. 
[00:31:00]  I hate when things work out well for people like that.  Like, I really would have liked to have heard his story about how it was sent back and  you lose.  Tom, what's going on?  Yeah, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Just going back to the FTP thing.  Yeah.  Jammed, and it's not your fault.  It couldn't be helped, okay?  Giving you two yo-yos, a CD, and telling them you can't play until next week is like giving  two two-year-olds a chocolate cake and they can't eat it until tomorrow.  Yeah, how stupid.  You know?  Well, you know what?  They didn't give it to us, though.  No, then one other thing.  We have to protect our source. 
[00:31:30]  I hear you.  One other thing.  How many people in Philly do you think turned on mid-song and said, see, I told you my letter  would work.  They won't live.  The music's back.  I told you.  Later, guys.  All right.  Let's go to Dan.  Dan, what's going on?  Not much.  I just turned you guys on.  I heard something about the dope sending his lottery ticket in the mail.  Yeah.  I'm not a high school graduate, and I won $53,000 in the lottery about two years ago.  Uh-huh.  And I knew better than to do that. 
[00:32:00]  The guy's a schmuck.  Did you take the day off and walk it down?  Yeah, I drove down.  It was like a 15, 20-minute drive.  I was like, why not?  Of course.  Yeah.  Give yourself a day off.  Yeah.  I think you deserve it.  Yeah.  I got a lot of friends I never knew I had, either.  All right.  Thank you.  Yeah.  All right.  Cool.  All right.  53 G's.  Hey, let's go to the FU line.  Show Philly what the FU line's about.  I don't think we played this last Friday.  We were so busy. 
[00:32:30]  It gives everyone a chance to vent about their week, right, Ant?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Somebody or something did you wrong.  We like to hear from you and let you, you know, get on the radio and yell and scream like a lunatic.  Whatever pissed you off.  You go to WNEW.com and you get the phone number for the FU line, okay?  Thanks for calling, and this is the Opian Anthony FU Friday line.  This is Noelle, and I'd like to give a big f*** you to Danny.  I know you're listening right now.  You've got only a ridden-ass boil.  I am not interested in you. 
[00:33:00]  I never was, and I never will be, you pathetic, dumbass pillow-biter.  You're genetically inferior to a used douchebag.  You are trash, so get back to your f***ing trailer and heat up some goddamn spam.  I hope that one day a girl has you arrested for stalking and sends you to prison so you  get f***ing raped by every bodybuilding dirtbag in there.  Go to hell, you f***ing loser.  Next message.  The big FU to that jackass in front of me who can't have a big drive! 
[00:33:30]  Next message.  Yeah, I got a big f*** you to my son's high school baseball coach who wouldn't know f***ing  talent if somebody was standing on his face with a pair of baseball cleats.  Next, end of message.  Hey, not bad.  Ben got a message on the FU line?  Yeah, get Stinky in here, because Stinky, we have Stinky in charge of, like, downloading  all the FU messages, and this came across, and he's like, Rick, you've got to listen to 
[00:34:00]  this.  I think it's Ben Stalker.  Yeah.  Yes.  Just play it.  Just play it.  This is an FU to Ben?  Not even.  Just check it out.  Yeah.  There's proof for changing, starving for truth.  I'm closer to where I started, chasing after you.  I'm falling even more in love with you, letting go of all I've held on to. 
[00:34:30]  I'm standing here until you make me move.  I'm hanging my moment here with you.  I'm living for the only thing I know.  I'm living in the grass to where to go.  I try to go, and I try to get into just hanging my moment here with you.  You're auditioning.  Hanging my moment. 
[00:35:00]  Hanging my moment.  Swamp yourself over the head.  Hang yourself with a noose.  Take the phone and hit yourself in the head.  That does sound like Ben Stalker.  The girl that's in love with Ben, though.  Ding, ding, ding.  Maybe it was to you, Ben.  Maybe it was to...  I don't know.  I don't know.  We got Joe, the lottery agent, on the line.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  I'm great.  I'm calling from Jersey.  I'm a lottery agent.  And there's something wrong with that story about that ticket. 
[00:35:30]  They're leaving some information out.  Because when you go to cash your ticket, you validate it with your machine, and then you're  in their system.  They know that that ticket's coming in.  So they're leaving some information out.  I'm missing your point.  They know when you go to cash your ticket, they know it's coming.  Because you have to have another ticket that shows that it's a winner before you mail  it in.  So they know it was coming.  Okay.  Do you understand or no?  No, Joe. 
[00:36:00]  He ran it through a machine.  Right.  We know he ran it through a machine.  The lottery commission claims that they don't know that it was validated.  Oh, you're saying it's a conspiracy.  If you want to believe that, sure.  Hey, Joe.  Thanks.  Okay.  Thanks for slowing down the show.  We greatly appreciate it.  Thank you.  Pat, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  They showed that picture of Clinton on C-SPAN this morning.  Right.  I almost threw up my Cheerios.  I was laughing so hard.  Oh, that's from an hour ago. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  On the front page of the Post.  I know.  Clinton just ogling some boobs on this girl at a wedding he was at.  Well, he wasn't looking at that British broad's bad teeth.  That's for sure.  Yeah.  Hey, he rolled into Philadelphia last week looking for a courtside ticket for the Sixers  game.  Yeah.  They put him in a second level.  Oh, I know.  I was reading that story on the page.  He couldn't get courtside?  Nope.  Nope.  This is a gross son of a bitch.  Pat Croce said he's the president of Sixers.  He said, hey, those pictures are taken.  People are already paid for.  I'm not giving them to you. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, he didn't get great seats for the game.  I love it.  Considering he's an ex-president.  How the hell does Clinton walk into a basketball game and not get courtside?  What the hell?  He crashed a wedding.  Yeah.  You know?  That's funny.  I think you would want him there, though.  It's kind of, you know, thumbs up to Pat Croce for doing that, man.  Damn right.  Take it easy.  All right, Pat.  See you.  I hear Clinton is just whoring himself out, though.  I'm reading he's got a price.  Like anybody can hire Bill Clinton for your event if you have enough money. 
[00:37:30]  He earns a staggering $380,000 speaking to investors in Shanghai.  Another place in Australia, a tech forum down under, paid him $264,000.  Let's pay him to get him on this show.  He's trying to get cash for a liquor endorsement?  Oh, yeah.  Get out of here.  It's in the story that you're reading, dude.  Bubba.  Turn to Bubba, page six.  Isn't that funny?  This is Bubba. 
[00:38:00]  Bar mitzvahs?  CSFB recently paid Clinton $100,000 for a 50-minute speech.  And Morgan Stanley apologized after paying $100,000 to Clinton to speak at a Florida conference.  He's showing up at weddings, bar mitzvahs, and whatever else all over the world because he's a schmoozer.  That's not the reason he's doing it. 
[00:38:30]  He then mentioned they were talking to an Irish distillery and a figure of 50,000 pounds, 75 grand, was mentioned.  I told him I couldn't afford that unless my wife had money stuffed in the mattress.  Can we scrape up some cake?  And get him on the show?  How much would it cost?  Have him show up.  Have a nagila.  Have a. 
[00:39:00]  Come on, everybody.  Let's dance.  Let's dance till the floor caves in.  We're a little yamaka.  Get my yamaka.  Look, I'm Zorba.  What the hell?  Boy, I don't remember any other president doing this.  Jimmy Carter building houses for Habitats for Humanity. 
[00:39:30]  Ronald Reagan losing his mind, drooling, eating ice cream.  He's doing this overseas to get away from his wife.  I mean, it's so obvious.  Hell yeah.  He has these opportunities in the States.  He's done a world tour since he's gotten out of the presidency, covering, like, I think  something like 25 different countries as far away as possible from that wife of his, from  Hillary.  And then he's just trying to get his own cake.  Yeah. 
[00:40:00]  You know, she's got her job in the Senate, and he's just, like, pocketing all this cash  and looking at girls' cans in different countries.  Jimmy!  You know, Clinton has the greatest plan known to man.  He is.  He's got everything wrapped up.  He's now wanting, you know, the guy you want to hang out with, if you think about it.  Yeah.  He's like a partying guy.  Exactly.  He's no longer the ex-president.  He's not, you know, he's the guy you want to hang out with, and he knows it. 
[00:40:30]  So he's using it to his advantage.  All right.  Thank you.  I'm sure he would show up for one of our teen weeks.  Oh, man, Anthony, I'm here with Earl at a sticker stop.  I want you to come on down to get your wow stickers.  It's going to be a lot of fun, a lot of girls flashing.  Hi, how you doing?  People beeping.  Yeah, nice tees, baby.  Well, Earl is doing a sticker stop today at the Tradewinds, 1331 Ocean Boulevard, Seabright, 
[00:41:00]  New Jersey.  Oh, we should announce that.  And we're hoping to get some people from Philly to show up at one of our road shows.  Oh, yeah?  These road shows that we do are legendary.  Yeah.  Legendary.  Stuff we cannot quite get away with on the air.  We take on the road and do it on stage.  When was the last time we did one?  Like April, I think?  Yeah.  Well, July 7th, we can announce it finally.  We're going to be at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park, New Jersey.  We are going to be rocking and rolling.  It's going to be insane. 
[00:41:30]  An all-day event, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a Saturday.  It's a Saturday, right.  All right.  You got my money?  All right.  Just make sure that check clears.  Okay.  All right.  I'm paid?  Okay.  I'll speak again.  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen, man, boy, love is a wonderful thing.  No, no, no, no.  It's a wonderful thing, man, boy, love.  And for me to stand here and address Nambla, it's just a pleasure.  You sure that check's going to come?  I'll make a beer disappear for 50 bucks. 
[00:42:00]  Watch.  I'll just bend over.  It'll go bye-bye.  I'll do bar tricks.  I don't care.  I'll play quarters with a college frat house for $250,000.  Too good.  All right.  We got to take a break yet.  Guys, could I do the Motley Crue challenge?  I could use a hundred bucks.  Just put it in the middle of the big double dong dildo.  Me and Al Gore, he's not doing nothing either.  Hi, kids.  I'm Barney.  Got this purple costume. 
[00:42:30]  It's hot.  It's the new Bozo the Clown.  You recognize me with all this makeup on?  It's me.  He doesn't need a nose.  Let's go to Dennis.  Ladies and gentlemen, a Sosa rookie card.  Be darling, be darling, be darling.  Dennis, what's up?  Yeah, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Yo, how much do you think he charged for, like, a bachelorette party?  He just comes out.  He'd, like, jump out of a cake, like a Speedo or something?  No, you got to get the knock on the door with all the girls hanging out at the house. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  Hi, the police are here.  Look, I'm just like a cop.  I'll take it off.  It's like quick-release Velcro pants.  Look at Bubba's.  Right on.  All right.  Remember to wear your safety belt when you get in the cab.  And look up front.  I'm driving.  I don't care.  I'll do anything for a buck.  Where are you going? 
[00:43:30]  On the way, Richard Jenney.  Yeah.  Ron Jeremy in studio.  Lots more to come.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Go f*** yourself.  And here's the Opie and Anthony F.U. Friday line.  And so it begins.  This is Kelly, and I want to give a big flying F.U.  to all you f***ing Bennys who decide to come down to the shore this weekend  for the rest of the weekend this summer.  Ruin my town, ruin my beach, and clog up my f***ing roads.  That's great. 
[00:44:00]  Now it's going to take me twice as long to get home on Fridays.  F*** you.  Next message.  Big F.U.  For all the people at the gym that don't carry a towel,  wipe down machines when they're done working out,  you need this sloppy, wet, all over the machine.  You know who you are, sir, F.U.  Next message.  I want to give a big f*** you to the stripper that gave me genital work.  I just spent the last afternoon getting them razored off my junk  and a pit dug into my junk, 
[00:44:30]  picking these f***ing things off my junk.  I want to give a big F.U. to this skanky pig slut.  You can suck it.  Next message.  Hey, this F.U. is going out to a guy named Nick.  He works in the World Trade Center.  I've been f***ing the S out of his girlfriend for the past four months.  So, saying hi and F.U.  End of message.  Opie and Anthony, 1027.  WNEW.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:45:00]  Vince Neal's supposed to call us, Ant.  Vince, we have to apologize to him  for abusing the Motley Crue Challenge like we did.  Yeah, Vince and Nicky from Motley Crue gave us a great fit for our radio show,  the Motley Crue Challenge.  Hopefully you heard it earlier this week.  Unfortunately, we had two fat pigs do it.  When they used to do it backstage at their shows,  they had hot, hot babes.  And we had pigs.  And we want to, you know, just kind of apologize to them.  And we're going to tell them we're going to try harder next time. 
[00:45:30]  Woo!  Joe, what's going on?  So, I hear you have Patient Zero in the studio.  What do you mean?  That AIDS-infected troll.  What, Ron Jeremy?  Yeah, I hope you're behind glass.  I thought you meant Rick.  No.  I hope you're behind glass or you're wearing, like, full body suits. 
[00:46:00]  We survived Sandy Kane the other day.  I think Ron Jeremy will be just fine.  You better watch out.  He might start...  You can't say that.  I'm sorry, bro.  I meant to say C.  I'm sorry.  What's your problem with Ron Jeremy?  Just look at him.  He's a troll.  You know, big deal.  He's a porno legend.  Bro, he's been trying to get on New York radio for years.  You let him in there, and now you're going to have to throw out the mics,  burn the seats, fumigate the place.  Jesus.  Porno legend.  We've had Ron Jeremy on before. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  So he's on every lame-ass punk rock band CD in the world.  Now he's trying to, you know, his career's running out.  Soon he'll just die of some disease, and we'll be rid of him.  Wow.  Why do you have such a problem with the guy?  Because he's just lame, man.  These porn stars, they all suck, first of all, and he's like the king of El Succo.  Well, Joe, when he's in the studio, you call back and tell him to his face.  I will.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Man, a little harsh.  I don't understand why he's so angry with a porn star. 
[00:47:00]  All right.  Let's go to Christine.  Christine, what's going on?  Hi.  Hi.  You're talking about the Motley Crue Challenge thing?  Yeah.  I read the book.  It's not in the book.  I know.  We had them on our show, and they told us that one.  I know, but when they were talking, I heard it, but when they were on the show,  they said, we'll tell you more about it.  Read the book.  No, the Motley Crue Challenge, they told us exactly what it was.  I remember what it was.  By the way, it was a great book.  Did you guys read the whole thing?  I read every word of the dirt.  It was awesome.  I loved it.  It really is a great book. 
[00:47:30]  Well, thank you so much.  Oh, by the way, it's my 30th birthday, and you guys helped make it that much better.  Going through a crisis?  Hmm?  Are you going through a crisis?  I'm up and down.  Would you like to come in and show off what you got?  I'm a little too far away.  Where are you?  I'm down in South Jersey.  South Jersey.  Are you listening on WYSP?  No, I'm at NW.  Oh, okay.  I'm on the east side.  I'm in Ocean County.  Oh, right on.  Well, happy birthday, Christine.  Thank you so much.  Okay.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's go to John.  John, what's going on? 
[00:48:00]  Hey, I just wanted to say, I agree with that other caller, that Ron Jeremy is the biggest  scumbag that ever walked the place.  He's the biggest jackass.  He manipulates little girls from all over the goddamn world.  Manipulates little girls?  Sure.  They're 16-year-old when they're doing this, and by the time they're 23, they're dead.  Where he should be, that scumbag son of a bitch.  Oh, I can't wait to get Ron Jeremy in here.  Oh, where is that bastard?  I thought they were...  Did he have a cane?  That son of a bitch.  I thought they were all girls of the legal age.  Please.  There's some of these are 16-year-olds from Korea, all over the world. 
[00:48:30]  Poor girls are dead, and this son of a bitch is alive.  Why?  I ask you why for heaven's name.  For porno.  For porno.  What's the problem?  There's a big problem.  People, everyone wants this guy dead.  Even the Honorable Most High, Mr. Norton.  Norton hates this guy.  Dead.  All right, Chad.  Thank you.  All right, bye.  It's going to get interesting when Ron Jeremy gets in here.  What's going on, Rick?  I'm just seeing the problem.  Oh, Richard Jennings out there.  Richard Jennings out there? 
[00:49:00]  Yep.  Yeah, get him on the phone.  All right.  Richard Jennings, a comedian.  Playing Carolines all this weekend, Anthony.  Called up yesterday.  Yes, he did.  At the end of the show, wanted to come in.  Mm-hmm.  Plug his show, Carolines.  And for some reason, he kept getting disconnected.  Right.  And we invited him to come in today.  Hello?  Yeah.  Hello.  Who's this?  This is Richard Jennings.  Who's this?  Richard Jennings. 
[00:49:30]  Hey, Richard, it's Opie and Anthony.  How are you?  Opie and Anthony, how are you?  Good.  How are you doing?  Good?  I'm just peachy, thanks.  When are you coming in?  I was thinking about coming in today.  Today?  Yeah.  At what time?  Probably about 4.40.  4.40?  It's what, 4.22?  Yeah.  I'm really close by.  Where are you?  I'm actually staying in the lobby.  You're outside the studio?  Yeah.  I've been staying in the lobby.  I didn't want to miss you guys. 
[00:50:00]  Hmm.  And you want to come in and do the show?  Yeah.  If it's okay, if you're not too busy talking about Ron Jeremy's penis, I could maybe stop  in.  Well, Ron's coming in, too.  You get along with him?  Yeah.  You said yesterday, right?  Yes.  I've met him before.  In fact, I used to do jokes about him in my head.  Oh, you did?  I used to do a joke about big, hairy, fat guys with hair in their back getting all  kinds of chicks, and he came up to me.  I did the porno awards.  That's how I met him.  Oh, really?  I had a bit in there about fat, hairy guys getting all kinds of women. 
[00:50:30]  He comes up to me and he goes, you were talking about me, weren't you?  And I go, no, no.  It was just a generic fat, porno, hairy guy.  It wasn't really you.  When you tell that joke on stage, do you get a laugh?  That wasn't actually the form.  It was just telling a story.  Oh, I thought you said that's something you do in your act.  Do you want to do a prison visit?  Do I want to do a what?  A prison visit.  No, why would I want to do a prison visit?  Well, that's where you're on the phone like you are now, and then you step up to the glass  on the door to the studio.  Right. 
[00:51:00]  And you talk that way.  No, I'm not doing that.  Come up to the glass.  It'll be fun.  It's like Oz.  You ever watch Oz?  Why can't I just come in?  I can't just come in the studio?  Are you worried about germs or something?  We're going to have Ron Jeremy in.  That was really funny.  That thing yesterday was really funny.  What thing?  The thing where you kept hanging up on it.  Oh, yeah.  It would be funny if we hung up on you right now.  No, I think it gets old.  It gets old after a while. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, it does.  This is our new game.  You're 15 feet away, and we're making you call us on the telephone.  At first, I was pissed off, and then I just started cracking up.  It was so juvenile.  Were you really mad?  At first, I was.  What the hell was that?  How could they do it?  And then I just go, that is just so asinine.  And then I have to laugh at it.  But if you're going to get mad at something like that, maybe you shouldn't be on our show  because we're juvenile.  That's true.  You know?  Well, it's up to you.  I was hoping you'd put me on.  Are you going to be funny, Richard?  Yeah, I'll be funny. 
[00:52:00]  Well, I'm sold.  I'm sold.  Not to put the pressure on you or anything.  I'll be funny.  Like, what's the first joke you're going to tell on the air?  Stop it.  You're totally putting him on the spot here.  Do you have a riff on, like, Clinton or anything?  Any riffs on things in the news?  There's lots of riffs on whatever you want to talk about.  Yeah?  But I've got to be in the studio to do them.  I'm not funny in the lobby.  Yeah.  So you got any knock-knock jokes? 
[00:52:30]  He's laughing at the juvenile stuff again.  Knock-knock.  Knock-knock.  Who's there?  Uh-oh.  Richard Jenny.  Richard Jenny who?  Richard Jenny, you're hearing knock-knock because I'm pistol whipping Opie and Anthony.  Get it?  Richard Jenny who?  Sorry. 
[00:53:00]  All right, Richard.  Can you give us a few minutes to think about it?  Yeah, think it over.  Opie, you are just the worst host ever.  All right, hold on, Richard.  Someone wants to talk to you.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let's go to Paul.  Paul, what's up?  Paul.  What's up, boys?  You're on the air with Richard Jenny who's right outside the studio on a phone.  Yeah.  Do yourselves a huge favor and leave him where he is.  Why?  Why?  He was on Ron and Fez yesterday and I felt like sticking a steak knife in my forehead. 
[00:53:30]  Oh.  Richard?  He was more boring than church.  Richard, did you have a good time on Ron and Fez yesterday?  Yeah, I did, but actually I feel like sticking a steak knife in his forehead, too.  He was horrendous.  He was horrendous.  All right, Paul.  Thank you.  That's not nice, Paul.  Richard Jenny came all this way.  He's in the lobby, outside the studio.  Right, Richard?  In the lobby.  Not for much longer. 
[00:54:00]  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  What is that?  Wait a minute, Richard.  I thought you know how to have fun and stuff.  Come on.  You're wearing me out with this crap.  We're just having fun and hanging.  All right.  You're not having fun with this?  It's funny for like a minute.  Yeah, but you know, some things are funny, right?  And then they get unfunny.  And then the longer they go on, it comes right back around and gets funny again.  Yeah, I guess.  We're waiting for it to get to that point again.  All right.  It's really not there yet. 
[00:54:30]  I have a long wait.  Richard, do you know what our show's about?  You ever hear our show?  What have you heard about the Opie and Anthony show, Richard?  It's nothing.  Not much?  Nothing?  No.  Are you from New York or where are you from?  Originally from New York, yeah.  And where you live in L.A. now?  Yeah.  So you're not familiar with this show?  No, but it's so popular.  So this could be like Commonplace and you wouldn't know it.  We might do this to every guest we've ever had. 
[00:55:00]  Are we on the air right now?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Really?  Yeah.  Why?  What?  You thought this wasn't on the air?  No, I thought we were just talking.  We are.  It's a talk show, kind of.  All right.  I'm going to hang it up.  All right.  What?  Hello?  Why did he hang up?  Did he hang up?  What's going on?  Go see how that went.  He's right outside the door. 
[00:55:30]  What's the matter?  We were having fun.  Why is everyone coming in here?  What's up, Stinky?  Stinky, what's wrong?  Nothing, nothing.  I don't fear for my life.  Is he okay?  Pacing a little.  Rick, go smooth things over, Rick.  Rick, you're the producer.  Take care of things.  No, we're going to go to the listeners and see if they want Richard Jenny on the show.  There he is.  He looks like he's going to kill us.  Richard Jenny.  Come here.  Sit down, man.  Are you doing this or not? 
[00:56:00]  Oh, no.  Come on.  It's all fun.  Richard Jenny, how are you?  Aren't you a good sport, Richard?  That's Opie over there.  I'm Anthony.  Uh-oh.  He looks all uptight.  What's the matter?  You spend too much time.  You're wasting time, right?  It's like a waste of time.  See, now you've got to be funny.  No.  After we just pissed you off.  He looks all pissed.  Here, get on the mic.  Just let's see how much we can screw with Rick and Bob.  That's what we do on this show.  We're idiots.  You want a shot of Jaeger? 
[00:56:30]  Are we on the air right now?  Yeah, we're on the air.  You want a shot of Jaeger?  We got a machine.  No, thanks.  Look what it did to you.  I know.  Would you like a beer or something to loosen up?  No, I don't need a beer.  No?  No.  It's not about needing it.  It's just, you know, you want to hang out.  Yeah, no, I don't drink.  You don't drink anymore?  I never started.  You didn't?  No.  You've never had a beer in your life?  I had a couple.  I've had beers.  I just never got a taste for it.  Oh, I got it.  Okay.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Michael feels bad, too, now.  Michael, what's going on?  Hey, guys, how you doing?  All right.  Listen, Richard, you're a real radio whore, aren't you? 
[00:57:00]  Well, me and your mom.  How many shows are you going to be on, man?  I mean, come on.  What's the problem?  What other shows would be on a radio show?  He's not funny.  He's, like, miserable.  He can't even go with the flow.  I mean, you know.  Well, we busted his balls the last two days.  Well, I mean, that's what comedians are all about.  But I really like you anyway, man.  You're a good guy.  Thank you.  I don't care.  Oh, man, a lot of people are uncomfortable out there.  I know.  Brian, what's going on?  Richard, I was thinking, just thinking back to some time when I was watching the UPN Network 
[00:57:30]  and your brilliant sitcom, Platypus Man.  Right.  Oh, that's right.  You were on that?  It sucked.  It did suck.  Well, finally, somebody is.  All right, I'll take that one.  It did suck.  Come on.  It was a bad show.  Did you see that, man?  No.  But how big an idiot are you for watching it, though?  What do you have going on in your life that you were watching a show that bad?  Come on.  Stick a knife in your forehead.  Joe, what's going on?  Yo.  Hey.  What's up with Anthony talking this stuff about President Clinton, man? 
[00:58:00]  What do you mean?  Well, did you read the whole article?  Yeah, why?  It says in the article that Bush was even worse.  Had much more requests for appearances.  I don't give a crap.  Well, you're saying he's a whore in himself.  He is.  He's there.  He whores himself out to parties and stuff for money.  And every politician does the same thing, correct?  So?  So.  Well, just say that, though, to make it out there because you voted for Bush, didn't you?  Don't take us too seriously there, Joe.  I understand.  I voted for Stalin.  All the presidents do that.  All the ex-presidents. 
[00:58:30]  That's it.  Well, just say that, though.  This guy didn't read the article either because it said they had much more requests, but they  turned them down.  Who did?  Bush?  Yeah.  Bush and Reagan before him.  What do you think of that, Richard?  What do you think about the presidents taking money after they get out of the office?  Well, what's wrong with that?  The guy's got to make a living.  Right.  Just like Richard Jenner.  Just be fair about it.  That's all.  I do the same thing.  Joe, we love Clinton.  No, and Anthony doesn't.  The guy's been a great source of entertainment over the past eight, nine years.  But you did vote against him, correct? 
[00:59:00]  Yes, I did.  Okay.  That's it.  I mean, come on, man.  All right, Joe.  Thank you.  All right.  I appreciate it.  All right.  Bye.  I have no idea.  Jesus Christ.  I'd have voted him in there for a third term if we could have.  A lot of uptight people.  All right.  So, Richard, you're playing Caroline's this weekend?  Caroline's this weekend and Governor's next Wednesday and Thursday in the Stress Factory  in New Jersey the following weekend.  Wow.  Governor's of Levittown?  Governor's of Levittown.  Okay.  Are you from there?  Long Island, yeah.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How is that place? 
[00:59:30]  It's fun out there.  Governor's of Levittown is a pisser.  Yeah, they get good crowds out there.  Yeah, they said they remodeled it because it was pretty bad.  Where are you from originally?  New York City.  New York City.  Brooklyn, New York.  Brooklyn.  And you never made it out to the island when you were living here?  Yeah, I did, but it was crappy then.  Right.  Governor's of a crappy club now.  Now it's gotten a lot better.  Now it's great.  Well, the beaches you went to out there, right?  Yes.  You know what I did recently?  I went on...  Oh, here comes a joke.  All right.  Oh, no, no.  Opie.  That was a joke.  Come on, Richard.  I get it.  Richard, let me explain something.  Look at two little babies. 
[01:00:00]  He's going to conform to our show.  Don't say...  We're not going to do the show.  He wants to...  Be more buddy.  Don't say two, because Opie is...  Press button, you big loser.  Press and button.  Be more buddy.  Opie's the biggest prick.  Let's cut him off.  Let's cut him off.  He's starting to sound like he's going on us, and we can't take it.  I was listening, and Opie is a prick.  You don't have a sense of humor?  Can you say prick on the radio?  Yeah.  You can say prick, sure.  I think you're changing it.  Really?  Yeah, you just can't use it in the context of a unit.  Right.  Like, I have a big...  Yeah, you could call someone a prick.  You could say, don't be a prick. 
[01:00:30]  Okay.  You can't say, I grabbed his...  Glenn.  Glenn, what's up?  Oh, man.  You guys got to cut Richard Jennings a break.  We are.  The hanging up yesterday, and then having to wait out in the lobby.  Oh, I haven't left his heart since Gary Coleman.  See, Nancy from Jersey.  Opie, you are such a rude, unfunny a-hole.  See?  See?  You're being bad to Richard.  See that?  All right.  People are mad at you.  All right.  What were you going to say?  I wasn't going to say anything.  I'll be quiet, then.  We'll do it your way.  I'll be quiet. 
[01:01:00]  We'll do it your way.  You're a big shot radio guy.  Let's not let him be funny on our show.  Oh, we're the funny way.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  We only bring in the comedians to abuse them.  Don't say we.  I was being nice.  I want to sit here.  I'm listening to what you're saying.  And we allow...  I hope he's being a jackal.  We allow a lot of people to be funny on our show.  Yeah.  So you didn't do your research.  We allow them to be funny.  Well, you know what I mean.  We allow them to be funny.  We have...  This is now officially turning uncomfortable.  We have this show, and people come in, and they're funny, and we don't care.  All right.  Okay.  All right?  So what were you going to say?  I forgot. 
[01:01:30]  What were you going to say?  I don't remember.  I don't remember.  What were you talking about, Ed?  I don't remember either.  You're being rude, Opie.  There was something about Long Island, right?  Yeah.  And governors.  Yeah.  And then you were going to say something.  I don't want to talk about this.  Let's do whatever it is you do.  We don't do anything, Richard.  This is what we do.  We just sit here and do nothing for four hours a day.  We goof on people and make them feel uncomfortable.  That's our gig.  We have to abuse the comics.  No.  All right.  We're trying to get along that.  We love the comics.  We've had a lot of comics on here. 
[01:02:00]  We had Jay in there yesterday.  We had Jay.  We have Norton comes in all the time.  We've had Andrew Dice Clay in here.  Ron Jeremy's coming in a little while.  He's not a comic.  He's pretty funny.  He wanted to be a comic at one point.  He's got some comics.  Have you watched some of those movies?  You watch those movies?  Yeah.  I've seen a couple.  Have you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've seen those back in his heyday.  Yeah.  He's great.  He's quite the guy.  He's...  I like...  I...  You know, people think that...  We should say this on the air.  That people...  This is a misconception that people have that men like porno, which is false.  It's men's penises that like porno. 
[01:02:30]  Right.  So, like, any guy, no matter how stupid he is, he's going, this movie sucks.  It has a bad watch.  Any people?  But the penis is going, it's genius.  It speaks to me.  I haven't seen performances like these in years.  I must have it for my collection.  So, I like Ron Jeremy.  He's a big, disgusting character.  Uh-oh.  Some people call him a hedgehog.  I got a porno dish, a satellite dish that plays porno 24 hours a day.  Yeah?  Plays other things, too.  You like your porno?  Uh...  You got a steady...  You got a steady gown?  You're never disappointed. 
[01:03:00]  You never sit there going, gee, I didn't think it would end that way.  It was really good right up until then.  Up until the money shot.  Watches fell apart.  What the hell happened there?  Tony Camacho, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  It's Tony Camacho from Rascals in New Jersey.  Yeah.  Now, the only room that Rich is not working in the New York area, and Jersey, whatever,  and I still got to say, he's the funniest man on the planet.  There you go.  By the way, Tony...  The proof is, go watch this man perform, and then get some opinions, because Rich is funny. 
[01:03:30]  By the way, Tony is the guy...  This is the first guy that told me about your show.  Oh, really?  Tony was the first guy that said, have you done Opie and Anthony?  And I said, no, you got to do that show.  He's the one to blame.  It's huge.  It's gigantic.  You got to go on them.  So, ever since then, you know, I've been calling.  And we've just been dicks.  All this resistance.  Opie's been a real dick.  Oh, come on.  We usually stick together with this one, Ant.  Shut up.  It's good cop, bad cop.  Rich, you got to make me look good now.  Okay.  Tony Camacho is the funniest guy ever booked a club. 
[01:04:00]  Hey, let me tell you, Rich.  Opie is solid.  You know, he loves comedy.  You show him a good comedy show, and he's good to go.  And I tell you, as far as...  You guys are big fans of Norton?  Yeah.  Norton's good, but Rich is better.  All right.  Uh-oh.  Cool.  Pitting comics against each other.  Great.  Thank you, Tony.  You're welcome.  Later on, brother.  All right, man.  What's your act like?  I'm really...  I haven't seen your stand-up.  Never?  Just like...  No.  You have HBO?  Yeah.  I saw him on HBO and stuff. 
[01:04:30]  You are?  Yeah, he's very funny.  You never saw me ever?  I swear...  No.  You're the target demo, man.  I know.  I'm sorry.  You're an Italian guy from New York, aren't you?  I...  I...  Are you Italian?  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  From Brooklyn.  Target demo.  Never saw the act.  It's, uh...  You know, what can I say?  It's your act.  You stand there, you talk.  I stand there and I talk.  Is it filthy?  No.  No?  No.  Very clean?  It's a little filthy toward the end.  Yeah.  But the whole thing isn't filthy, no.  Okay.  No, it's not.  A little lifestyle stuff?  It's...  You wouldn't like it. 
[01:05:00]  No?  It's not annoying.  It doesn't embarrass anyone.  I like all forms.  It's not into humiliating anybody.  We like all forms of comedy.  Let's break them down like a rifle.  We like Jim Norton, who's as dirty as they get, and we love Brian Regan, who's as clean  as they get, and everyone in between, Jay Moore and the rest of the gang.  So you just have to go through a certain amount of abuse until you get to be part of  the Opie and Anthony family.  Yeah.  I think we just got off on the wrong foot, somehow.  Yeah, that was...  I don't know how that would happen.  That was Anthony's idea yesterday. 
[01:05:30]  I don't know how that happened.  I think it's maybe because we hung up on you, and then when you were here, we called you  from the Opie, which would be really funny if it wasn't happening to me.  Hey, I like that.  See?  It's always funny unless it's you.  Yeah, it's always funny unless it's happening, unless you're the guy.  All right.  Let's go to Justin.  Justin, what's going on?  Just something to say, Richard Jennings.  Three more funny!  Oh, shut up.  We played that already for him.  Yo, but...  We played that twice.  I think you guys should bring in Norton.  I'm sorry. 
[01:06:00]  Norton was supposed to be here.  All right.  Thank you, Justin.  No problem.  All right.  Well, why don't we take a break and regroup?  All right.  We'll regroup, Opie, and we'll, like, start over.  All right.  We'll start fresh.  If you start yelling at us, we're just going to turn the mics on.  I'm not yelling.  Yeah, be prepared, affiliates.  We might just pop the mics up.  Yeah, because if he's going to yell at us, everyone else has to hear it, too.  Right.  I'm not.  Richard Jennings.  I think we should go to an Italian restaurant, all three of us.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And I'll forget my gun inside, and then it'll all be fine. 
[01:06:30]  Richard Jennings playing Caroline's all this weekend, and we'll talk to him next.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  1027.  WNEW is the sports guys at 5 a.m.  The radio chick at 9.  Ron and Fez at noon.  Opie and Anthony at 3.  Don and Mike at 7.  It's the radio chick.  Once we had this survey about which occupations produced guys that were the best in bed, unfortunately, garbage men weren't on the list. 
[01:07:00]  Garbage guys were on the list not for sex, but they gave the best oral.  Apparently, they don't mind the smell.  The radio chick.  Weekdays, 9 to noon.  1027.  WNEW.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  Serving New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  This is 1027.  WNEW.  New York.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  In studio, Richard Jenney playing Caroline here in New York all weekend long. 
[01:07:30]  Also has a website, richardjenney.com.  What's on that?  All the information about Richard Jenney you would ever want to know.  Really?  Where he's going to be, what he's doing.  Do you run it yourself?  Are you pretty internet savvy?  Yeah, I am.  Yeah?  Yeah, I love the internet.  The internet proves once and for all that no matter how much of a twisted sexual mutant you are, you've got pals.  Right.  You can just sit there making stuff up.  Find people who have sex with goats that are on fire.  And the computer goes, specify type of goat. 
[01:08:00]  Did you get into it?  I thought I was alone.  Did you get into it, like, early on?  No.  Because I know I was on the internet, I mean, pretty much the second it became popular.  Why?  Because I knew I could get porno there.  For free.  For free, even though the old days you'd have to watch it, like, scrolling.  Slowly but surely.  The graphics would come up and you'd see the top of her head and then her eyes and the face.  That was better, actually, to me.  Was it?  It was like a peep show.  It was like a tease.  Like, nice head, nice body, nice penis. 
[01:08:30]  Wrong website.  Wrong website.  I need a manly website now.  Someone sent me one of those the other day.  ChillingSmallAnimals.com.  It was, uh, I forgot the title, but it was a girl showering.  An Asian girl.  Really hot, nice, nice cans and stuff.  And her body was kind of like this.  Oh, kind of turning away from the camera.  You know, she's teasing the camera.  And all of a sudden she turns around, just like Richard Jenny said.  Hello, junk.  Man junk.  Man junk.  And I screamed.  You know what the internet is to me now?  It's like, it's like the Lenny and Squiggy of debauchery. 
[01:09:00]  Did you ever watch that show?  Remember that old show Laverne and Shirley?  Of course.  Remember they always do the same gag?  They would always do the same gag.  The gag would always be like, where are we going to find anybody who's stupid enough?  And then the guy would come in going, hello.  Yeah.  That's, that's like the internet.  Like, I would, just when you think it can't get sicker.  I was at a website called The Best of Bestiality.  Why were you there?  The best of it.  Because when I'm looking at bestiality, only the best will do.  None of that second rate.  So, you know, I'm looking at it, right?  And there's like, and there's like a woman, you know, like with a horse. 
[01:09:30]  Horse gag.  Yeah.  And you're going, what could be sicker and grosser than click?  Hello.  You know, a moose.  And my friend goes to me, he goes like, what is she thinking?  And I go, you know what?  What's the moose thinking?  What happens to the moose after this experience?  So it's fine for her.  She's an attractive moose.  She got her rocks off.  She moved on.  What about the moose?  Left there, all night, drinking, writing letters.  Dear penthouse, I never thought anything like this would happen to me.  It's not fair to the moose is the point I'm making.  You've got to wonder what the hell happens. 
[01:10:00]  What happens to him?  Especially if he's a gay moose.  It's confusing.  Like, what just happened to me?  Someone sent me a video of a horse mounting a lady the other day.  Really?  Insane.  Everyone's seen horse gag.  Horse gag.  That's the best one where the woman is, she's doing an oral favor, let's just say.  And all of a sudden, the payoff is when she goes, and just starts gagging and choking on whatever happens at the end of that videotape. 
[01:10:30]  And you wonder how her life has brought her.  How that long road since toddler, then up through adolescence, what led her to the point where she's underneath a horse going,  Well, one thing's for sure.  Her parents are dead.  Because this is something you can't do when your parents are alive.  Right after, if they weren't, they were after.  Yeah, because you know that this is not what they had in mind.  When she was a little baby, a little pink toad, little baby, they weren't thinking, you know, one day. 
[01:11:00]  Well, there she is graduating from elementary school.  There she is at her prom.  That's our girl.  You never have that in mind when you have a kid.  No.  It's not something that you're thinking of.  I just know somewhere along the line, there was an uncle.  And somebody, somewhere along the line, somebody pitched it to her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can just picture the guy.  Trust me, this is how all the big actresses talk.  You're going to love this.  And Melody Griffith never talks about it anymore.  But if I had a death.  Trust me.  You look at these girls and you go, what am I doing wrong? 
[01:11:30]  How is it possible that I'm not having sex every second when there are women who are capable of being talked into?  With a horse.  Yeah.  Deal with a horse.  I hope there have been nights that you leave a bar alone going, where are they?  What happened?  Yeah.  Where's the girl with the horse?  What am I?  I don't have enough legs.  What's my problem?  The hooves.  She really had something for hooves.  I hope they didn't dump out of that.  Oh, yeah, that word might have been a little sensitive. 
[01:12:00]  The shiz?  Yeah.  Is that a word that's not a word?  I don't know.  Because that was really, really funny.  Yeah.  Maybe they let it slide.  Who knows?  Mike, what's going on?  Not allowed.  Okay.  Hey, guys.  I'm glad you're finally letting Richard talk.  Well, yeah.  We like Richard.  We're just affing with him.  I know.  But I got to stick out for him.  Because I've seen Richard in Vegas.  I've seen him in AC and Rackle.  Seen him under horses.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, yeah. 
[01:12:30]  But he's a very, very funny guy.  No, we like Richard.  Mike, he wouldn't be on the show if we didn't think so.  We just want to bust his balls.  That's what we do on this program.  And Richard, don't take it personally.  These guys are good guys.  Who else is it happening to?  We've done it to every person who's ever appeared on this show.  You should have seen the abuse that Dice took.  Really?  And still takes for years it's been.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, usually it wears off after a while and we just hang out.  It hasn't with Dice.  Every time he comes in, we're just like, hey, Dice is playing the garden. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  Olive Garden.  I punch it in.  And then he's like, Olive Garden, let me tell you something.  Back in 1989, I packed out Madison Square Garden.  And it never ends.  It just goes on and on.  Does he really get pissed?  Oh, yeah.  This just in.  Can't say.  Oh, the J word has just been.  Rhymes with fizz.  Rhymes with fizz, right.  Yeah, too bad.  I don't know what the line is anymore.  That's the thing, man.  It's very great.  I don't know what you're allowed to say.  Yeah, anything. 
[01:13:30]  What you're not allowed to say.  Anything too descriptive is taboo.  And you know what the reason for it always is?  The children.  Right.  It's always the children.  You can't have the sex on TV because, you know what?  The children aren't ready yet.  Yeah, so we have to suffer.  But let me ask you this.  Is anybody ever really ready to find out what human beings do with their children?  I don't think I'm still not ready.  It's still free.  You mean that goes in there?  And then you put a thing with goo?  I still haven't gotten my mind around it.  You make a good point because when I found out around 11 or 12, I spent the whole afternoon in an apple tree. 
[01:14:00]  I didn't want to come down.  I don't believe it.  I was absolutely horrified.  My dad is begging me to come out of the tree so he can tell me the facts of life.  It's horrifying.  Because we saw the movie in class.  In class, I think.  Health class, the movie that they used to show you, yeah.  And they separate the boys and girls.  They take you to the opposite ends of the gymnasium, show the girls the girl film, guys the guy film.  Right.  The hygiene and changing of the bodies and what happens.  And most kids are just shocked and horrified.  I walked around in a daze for like a month. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  It was like, what was that movie with Jim Carrey where the whole world was playing a big joke on him?  Oh.  No, yeah, Truman.  It was like the Truman Show.  It was like, up until then, the only sex I ever heard about was horrible and took place in jokes and it was, you know, sluts.  And I walked around for like a month going, what, she did it and she didn't.  But my grand, jeez, grandma, you slut.  Yeah, when you start picturing that.  My grandmother at least twice or three times.  And I was horrified.  And that's why I don't get, you know, the children can't see sex. 
[01:15:00]  You know what I mean?  I mean, I'm not saying, I don't want to, I'm not saying kids should watch a lot of porno.  All I'm saying is this.  I'm just saying, if you don't get, if you don't, at least when kids see porno, they would get the right information.  You know what I mean?  These people are the experts.  They know how to do it.  Here's how it works.  Yeah, but when you have kids telling other kids, it's like the world's worst game of telephone.  You know what I mean?  And you never get the right information.  You get it wrong.  Yeah, it's like one kid, you should get pregnant if you don't use a condom.  Pass it on.  You should get pregnant if you're not in a condominium.  I had the worst, most contorted view and ideas of how sex was done when I was like, I don't know, elementary school. 
[01:15:30]  You know, the kids start talking about what they think sex is.  And I actually thought that in order to have a baby, the guy had to be with the woman and use the back entrance and had to use a rubber because that's all the stuff to make a baby was on the rubber.  And where did you get this information from?  My uncle, who said, keep the secret. 
[01:16:00]  Your uncle told you this?  I'm going to, no, it was kids in school.  It's kids.  Yeah.  Kids, yeah, I like kids, but they're not, you can't be trusted with important information.  The first girl I was with was really surprised when I flipped her up and said, let me take this condom off so you don't get pregnant.  I heard, don't kiss the girl when she's on her period because she'll explode.  That's true.  Oh, that one.  That actually happened to you?  Yeah.  They explode.  Happy birthday.  Oh, I've heard, you know, kids don't give, these are kids. 
[01:16:30]  These are the same people who used to tell me, step on a crack, you'll break your mother's back, which I was pretty sure was a lie.  But you don't want to be that one kid in a million that goes, I'm stabbing you, come home, and there's your mom, damn you!  You couldn't listen to them, could you?  Don't look upon me!  I knew I shouldn't have stepped on a crack.  Rolling in the wheelchair up to you.  Richard Jennings is going to be at Caroline's all this weekend.  We've got to interrupt Richard for a second because Earl, Black Earl, is at the WOW sticker stop today.  Ah!  You want to hear comedy, Richard? 
[01:17:00]  Richard, oh, listen to Earl.  Black Earl?  Yeah.  He wears all black.  That's why we call him Black Earl.  All right.  He never wears anything but black clothing from his black Yankee cap down to his black shoes.  All black.  All right.  Oh, and he's also a Negro.  Yeah.  What are we, in the 60s?  He's a colored folk.  He's a colored fella.  But Earl helps us out with these WOW sticker stops.  Earl!  Earl! 
[01:17:30]  See what I mean?  This is comedy at its best.  Earl!  Earl!  Stop a show.  Hey, guys, what's up?  Like a van full of kids on train tracks.  Earl!  Yeah.  Wham!  Say hi to Richard Jennings.  Hello, Richard.  How are you?  Hello, Black Earl.  How you doing?  I'm good.  A bunch of guys are here.  We're at the Tradewinds in Seabright, New Jersey.  There they are.  All right.  We're at the, uh, pick up the summer blast.  Who's stepping their way, uh, who's stepping their way to a sticker stop? 
[01:18:00]  Earl, you're going to be there until five, you just said?  I'm sorry.  We're going to be here until seven.  We'll hear from five until seven.  Oh, okay.  It's not Earl from the past.  All right.  It's only three o'clock here.  So you just got there, and you're going to spend a couple hours, right?  We're going to be here for a couple hours handing out WOW stickers.  The beers are flowing, and it's, uh, it's a great time here in Seabright.  People swimming in the, uh, pools they have there? 
[01:18:30]  I'm sorry?  Oh, thank you, Earl.  All right.  Thanks, Earl.  It's the Tradewinds in Seabright, New Jersey, right?  Yes.  We're back in, uh, back at the scene of the crime, so to speak.  What's the address?  It's 1136 Ocean Avenue.  All right.  Thanks, Earl.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Bye.  Can I ask you a question?  Yeah.  Um, is that what he does?  Yeah.  Yeah, and that's all we can figure out that he does here.  He's been working here for, uh, years.  Long time.  And we don't know what he does.  So pretty much he's a black guy that tells you what bar he's in?  Uh.  Oh, yes. 
[01:19:00]  And that kills five minutes of the show.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, you got to fill the fill out of the bag.  But what makes it fun is he messes it up every single time.  Yeah.  And we look forward to his phone call every afternoon.  Yeah, he never knows where he is.  He's always late to these things.  He can't figure out where he's going.  And he usually, um, uh, quits every day.  He didn't quit today.  We give him a lot of abuse, and he, uh, he usually quits.  All right.  But then, but then, yeah, it's just a black girl.  That's it.  Black girl.  All right, we have to take a break.  Ron Jeremy's outside.  Yeah.  He's going to join the party.  Not all of them. 
[01:19:30]  Huh?  Not all of them.  Not all of them?  Not all of them is outside.  Some of it is.  The door is opening.  Yeah.  Yeah.  First, we're going to speak with his penis, and then we're going to invite him in.  Yeah.  He'll join the party.  Richard Janney in studio.  He's playing Carolines all this weekend.  Catch the best of Opie and Anthony.  Saturdays, W.  11 to 3.  1 0 2 7 W N E W.  Anthony.  Yes, Opie, as you eat again.  Sam Adams.  You graze.  I do.  All day long.  What are you going to wash that down with, Opie? 
[01:20:00]  Um, Sam Adams.  Some Sam Adams, yes, ice cold Sam Adams.  They got Summer Ale now out, and it's a great seasonal beer, the Summer Ale.  It's like my great-grandfather used to say, the bottle's as big as Ron Jeremy's junk.  Enjoy the creamy head.  Sam Adams Ale tastes great, crisp, refreshing, and it's a beer for summer.  So if you're at the beach, or you're maybe at a concert, maybe you're going to see STP at  Jones Beach, Friday. 
[01:20:30]  Right?  Next Friday.  Next Friday.  What you do is you tailgate outside with some icy cold Sam Adams.  Anthony, I've got to interrupt your Sam Adams live ring.  Stalker Patty, if you're listening, come down to the studio.  We have a huge, huge surprise for you today.  Nice.  Stalker Patty, get your ass down to the studio immediately.  Sam Adams, right in.  Sam Adams.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:21:00]  Richard Jenny in studio, playing Carolines all this weekend.  And he's going to be at Governor's June 20 and 21.  June 20 and 21.  And then the Stress Factory, June 22nd through the 24th.  Also in the studio, Jim Norton.  Norton, how you doing, man?  We've got to get Ron Jeremy in here, and then we've got a definite party happening.  I've been looking at Ron Jeremy's filmography on Internet Movie Database. 
[01:21:30]  I'm looking, listed here, a total of 633 movies.  And then there's films he's directed.  He's got 85 films that he directed.  Consultants on a bunch of films.  There he is.  Ron Jeremy.  Jesus Christ.  I'm looking at all the movies you've been in.  Yeah, I consulted Boogie Nights in 9 1⁄2 Weeks. 
[01:22:00]  And others, you know.  Who the hell wouldn't want you to consult Boogie Nights?  I think this is the first time I've seen him with clothes on.  I'll look better that way.  Hey, I got something with Richard here.  Richard, remember you and my video, music video, Freak of the Week?  Yes, I do.  Well, here's the Billboard chart.  We were on 27 weeks on the chart.  Yeah, he called me.  And here's the cassette.  Ice-T, me and DJ Polo.  Yeah, this guy is nothing if not persistent.  Called me up and goes, all right, I got this thing.  It's called Freak of the Week, and Charlie Sheen's going to be in it.  And all I want you to do is dance around, and you can do it anywhere. 
[01:22:30]  Your backyard, doesn't matter.  Just, you know, I just want you to be in it.  Just be in the video.  I go, yeah, well, let me talk to my manager.  All right, what did you mind?  He's got like 10 phone calls.  And finally it came down to, look, I am in front of, literally, he was in front of the house.  Look at the house.  I'm here right now.  I have a video camera.  All you have to do is just go in the backyard.  Go in.  How hard is it to go in the backyard?  Just stand and dance.  You're done.  That was it.  Of course, he's a tough sell.  I mean, a guy gets girls to do all kinds of things.  We had 22 celebrities in it.  It was on Billboard for 27 weeks.  It was a hit single.  Look at that. 
[01:23:00]  And no F in it.  Richard Jenny helped out.  It's clean.  So it's radio.  Wow.  It's radio, yeah.  Freak of the Week.  There it is.  I got to break in for a second.  Nobody got paid.  Yes, Opie.  Stalker Patty.  We announced this to our New York audience, but now we're back on it in Philly again.  Yeah.  We told Stalker Patty to come down to the station because we have a huge surprise for her.  Yes.  A huge surprise.  And it concerns Ron Jeremy.  Don't say anything else.  Rick told you what you're going to do, right?  Yep.  It's kind of exciting.  Yeah, cool.  A huge surprise.  Huge.  Stalker Patty is a 46-year-old virgin, Richard. 
[01:23:30]  Seriously.  Honestly, a virgin.  46-year-old virgin.  They say that a lot, but how are you going to prove it?  No, this one, believe me, when you see her, you'll go, okay, she is.  Oh, she's going to show us that she's a virgin.  We're going to meet Hyman close up.  I don't buy that.  The second she walks in, you will look at her and go, yeah, there will be no doubt.  We can line up 20 girls, and you will pick out the virgin Stalker Patty.  Oh, this is interesting.  46 years old.  I'm looking at the films, Jesus Christ Superstar.  No, I wasn't in there.  It says uncredited, and it has you. 
[01:24:00]  It's a mistake.  It is?  It is a mistake.  I was wondering how you go from Jesus Christ Superstar to that.  The latest ones that I was kind of excited was Orgasmo, the South Park guys in that,  and then Detroit Rock City, the Kiss movie, and then Boondock Saints with Willem Dafoe.  Yeah, that was good.  And then a TV show, Nash Bridges, and Just Shoot Me had a couple of parts in, you know.  I'm still looking at the guy doing legitimate stuff.  Well, I'm trying.  I mean, it's tough, you know.  I'm doing my best.  It's been done before.  What's that girl that crossed over for?  Tracy Lawrence.  Tracy Lawrence.  We had her in the studio, and she's like, don't even, I don't even want to discuss my past.  You can't even talk about, I know, but she keeps the same name. 
[01:24:30]  I know.  We all know who she is.  If you really hate your past that much, change your name.  You ever told that one?  Yes, a couple of times.  You did?  Oh, you guys are right.  Stalker Patty.  Hey, Tim, let's Stalker Patty on that mic.  That's Stalker Patty.  No doubt, right?  46-year-old virgin.  Now, are you a virgin because there just were no decent guys that you liked,  or you just turned them down, or you just don't like the idea of sex?  You like women?  Get ready for this voice.  Are you a man in drag?  No. 
[01:25:00]  Why are you a virgin?  You really are a virgin at 46.  Yes, I am.  How come?  Explain to Ron Jeremy.  This will be hilarious.  Explain to Ron Jeremy why you're a virgin.  Maybe the guys she knows just suck.  I mean, why?  Well, I have values.  Well, I respect that.  I have values, too.  Not the same as hers.  They're not exactly the same.  But now, you have to get married first before you have sex?  Yeah, well, okay.  In this day and age, I would rather be in a committed relationship before I have sex.  Well, what can you do? 
[01:25:30]  Have you done other things besides the distance?  Have you had, like, heavy petting, kissing, grabbing, touching, feeling, holding, you know?  No, I've never done that.  The closest she's had to having any kind of sex...  Was being in this room with us right now.  Well, being in this room, and Jim Norton, who was standing right there, felt her up.  Look, I could reach her from here, you know what I'm saying?  No, I'm kidding.  He felt you up?  He did...  Yeah.  I could do a thing on her neck that gives her goosebumps.  Really?  Yeah, it works on virgins.  Can I do something with your neck?  All right.  As long as she doesn't help me.  Twist it like a chicken. 
[01:26:00]  Now, guys, watch her arms.  Look at her arms.  All right.  Look at her arms.  Now, watch what happens to her arms.  Ron Jeremy's right behind Stockholm Pattern.  Watch this.  Oh, my God.  Okay, go ahead.  Now, look.  Look at him now.  Wait.  She's got goosebumps.  Look at her.  And she's not a virgin anymore.  Here, here's the necklace.  See that?  Look at her arms.  That is the grossest thing I've ever seen in my life.  She's got goosebumps all over her body.  Look at her legs.  Let me try your shoulder.  Let me do her shoulder first.  Let me just show you.  All right.  Don't worry, Patty.  He's okay. 
[01:26:30]  Relax, Patty.  He's biting her.  He's biting her.  He's bitter.  No, gently biting.  Gently biting.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Look at her legs.  See that?  See that?  Little bumps?  Feel that.  Look at that.  Hey, listen, Jim.  Check that out, Jim.  Watch that.  Rich and Jenny is horrified.  Nice.  I've seen him do this before.  It's like a slow process, but by the fourth one, she's going, ow!  Relax, you're still a virgin.  I've got both hands on your shoulders, and you feel a slight pressure. 
[01:27:00]  Patty, how did that feel?  Interesting.  He was nibbling on your neck and your shoulder there, huh?  You gently nibble.  Right.  It gives a girl's goosebumps, and you know, you often get some of the mood a little bit,  you know.  It starts out with a nibble.  Next thing you know, it's an eight-man interracial, well, you know, porn, you know.  Patty, have you ever seen any of Ron Jeremy's work?  Pass like a raffle ticket, you know?  What?  Have you ever seen any of Ron Jeremy's work?  I don't think so.  Do you know Ron Jeremy?  Have you ever watched a porno?  I just know the name from maybe television or paper, but I don't know what he does.  And what do you think he does? 
[01:27:30]  What do you think he does?  Well, I was listening to the show.  Yeah, ruined it.  You're in soft porno or something.  Soft?  No, that's rock-hard porno.  Just stuff.  But now, I'm still thinking about it.  So, no guy ever got to kiss you or no petting?  No guy ever saw you above the waist nude?  Oh, no.  Oh, we've seen her.  We've gotten her naked here in the studio.  Oh, it's even totally nude.  It was a harmless thing, a whipped cream bikini contest.  Go on.  What's your ethnic?  You're the same as me and Richard, I think.  What's your ethnic?  Well, on my father's side, Spanish. 
[01:28:00]  And on my mother's side, Czechoslovakian.  Religion?  Hungarian and German.  I was raised a Roman Catholic and then I got involved with a sect in college that was like a Christian type of a sect.  They were like kind of against, you know?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  In fact, one time I was going to a church in the village at the time and I wore shorts and the lady in charge of the congregation took me aside and told me I was giving the brothers trouble. 
[01:28:30]  So, you must be in a committed relationship or married?  Committed or?  Well, committed only because there's just too much out there that I'm afraid of.  I don't have protection for things like that.  Right, Patty.  They have protection for things like that.  You don't get AIDS from kissing, hugging, grabbing, feeling, petting.  She's really worried about diseases.  She's freaked out about it to the point where she hasn't had sex.  You have no idea what you just caught, Patty.  Why don't you kiss and pet and hug and things like that?  I mean, well, don't get me wrong. 
[01:29:00]  I've been on dates.  Do you have sex alone?  Do you have, like, a vibrator?  Do you ever have sex alone?  I was always taught that it was wrong to do things like that.  I grew up in a very strict Catholic family.  I was 17 years old.  I had a bedtime and I had to be in the house at 7 o'clock and I was watched like a hawk.  One time when I was about 16, I was hanging out with some friends and a guy did whatever.  Honey, honey, if you like hawks, you like what's in my pants.  It's foul.  I used to have cronies watching everything I did and they would make phone calls. 
[01:29:30]  Well, this guy wanted to give me a kiss and I wouldn't allow him to because I felt I was being watched.  Do you ever get, and be honest now, don't lie, do you ever get a little horny, a little turned on,  like maybe TV, Brad Pitt, Mel Gibson, Richard Jennings, Ron Jeremy.  Does anybody get you on TV, a rock star, actor?  It's a rock star, Ron.  Who gets you?  I'm in love with the Edge.  Who's that?  From you, too. 
[01:30:00]  From you, too.  My favorite band of all time.  Now, suppose he was here in the studio and started kissing your neck and touchy-feely.  Would you finally let go a little bit, you think?  Well, let me tell you.  I happened to.  But just, let me just say, he says, look, how about this?  We come back, you sit down on my penis, and Sunday Bloody Sunday is playing in the background.  What a coincidence.  You're wearing shades.  What are you going to, are you going to say no?  He's got a knit cap on, and he's naked. 
[01:30:30]  Man, the way you set that up, I'd do it, Richard.  Say that again and say it slowly.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  I think part of my thing is people's approval.  I wasn't approved by adults when I was a kid, because I had...  Oh, you're past that now.  You're 46.  Yeah, you're 46.  I would accept that.  I would accept that at your 20s.  I mean, you don't...  But look, if you don't miss sex, what the heck?  I mean, you don't miss it, right?  No, she's getting worked on now.  I would want to share something like that that I have a special relationship to to share. 
[01:31:00]  It's not much to share at 46 anymore.  You should have shared that.  It kind of is like a stock.  It loses value.  I don't know.  What it is, is I was always involved with people who watched everything I did and made judgments against me.  Well, we understand your past.  I wasn't a nice person anymore.  We understand the past.  But he makes a good point there.  It's like saying, you know, I want to sell my house, but I'm going to wait until the paint is dripping and it has termites.  Smells all musty.  The lawn's overgrown.  What does Sam Kennison say? 
[01:31:30]  Like a cheese sandwich?  Was that...  It's just that I want to be...  You know, people think of me in general as a sweet person.  I want to be sweet.  You are.  You are.  Hey, Al Brown...  You're turning sour quick, though.  Would you like to see Patty Topless?  Can we see your boobies?  Give a little flash.  Patty.  That's one thing they've gotten me to do as well.  I'm here now.  I've never seen...  Can I see...  Ron Jeremy's never seen a woman naked.  I don't think that's true.  Let's see, honey.  Well, I've never seen a virgin in 46 naked in my life. 
[01:32:00]  This is going to be the first time you've seen this record breaker.  Ron, how long did it take you to fire up a money shot all over her front?  How long?  Nine and a half inches.  That's how long.  Let's see, honey.  Imagine a Ron Jeremy money shot all over Patty.  That's very nice.  See, perky, right?  Who's the last guy that actually...  Did he touch them, Jeremy?  Norton touched those.  It was actually community service for an offense committed.  I buy it.  Patty, if Ron Jeremy wanted to, would you allow Ron to maybe feel you up a little bit? 
[01:32:30]  Touch the boobies?  Just give a little touch.  A little touch.  Ron, what do you say?  She's a 46-year-old virgin.  Can I touch the boobies?  I'll keep it just at that.  What do you say, Patty?  Just a little touch.  Loosen you up.  Ron's not too familiar with sex.  I'll let you, you can grab back just for the fun.  I'll let you, you can touch me back.  Ron's, yeah, Ron's not too familiar with the whole sex thing.  I feel, you feel, you flash, I flash.  We'll make an even change.  And you're getting it better off.  Ron's a bigger.  I don't mean the top, you fudge.  I like the buffet.  Pick on a guy for it.  Can we see him again, honey?  Bitch, kids. 
[01:33:00]  What do you say?  What do you say, Patty?  There you go.  Oh, my God.  Patty's going to get felt up by Ron Jeremy.  Ron Jeremy.  Patty, go ahead.  Just lift it up.  There you go, Patty.  It's Ron Jeremy.  Don't resist.  We'll take out the pepper spray.  It's Ron Jeremy.  Don't make us mace you.  Pepper spray.  Go ahead, Patty.  No one will say.  Patty, it's okay.  Relax.  Patty, take a breath.  Relax.  It's okay.  It's actually, you know, she puts it so hard to get. 
[01:33:30]  It's actually kind of exciting.  Isn't it?  Patty.  She did it, like, real quickly.  We'll do the same thing.  Patty, let her rip.  You're acting like he's an expert or something.  Patty, let him.  Let him.  She's laughing because it's tickling her.  There you go.  There you go.  Oh, man.  Don Jeremy's killing on Patty.  What do you think?  They're actually nice.  You like them?  Ron.  Now, the gym.  Anyone ever kissed them before?  No one's ever kissed them before. 
[01:34:00]  Patty, why don't you let Richard Jenny kiss you, buddy?  Oh, you're getting in trouble with the wife or girlfriend?  What do you think, Patty?  Nice, right?  It's Ron Jeremy.  What do you think?  I think that's the first time Ron's ever done that.  Do you want to take a feel back?  Do you want to take a feel back?  Do you want to just touch the outside?  This way I feel where it's an even trade.  See, I can take your hand real slowly.  That's all right.  I'll take...  No, that's okay.  That's okay.  You don't want to feel man junk?  This is an amazing show.  It's like, Rich, you went too far with the slang word for Spoon.  We'll be right back with Ron Jeremy molesting a virgin. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, we don't understand it either.  That's funny, Rich.  What a twisted turn of events.  Patty, all right?  Your last chance, Patty.  You want to get one little feel on the outside, just the back of your hand?  You want to just brush by it like this?  That's not necessary.  You won't catch anything through the pants, although it's Ron Jeremy.  It's not necessary.  Patty, it's okay.  Loosen up.  Look, watch.  You go like this.  Watch, watch.  Just brush it.  Just brush against it, Patty. 
[01:35:00]  How about your foot?  Your foot just...  Patty, have you ever brushed up against...  Kick him in the balls, Patty.  I'm still kicking the nuts.  What do you say?  I find peanut butter with nuts.  What do you say?  Patty, have you ever brushed up against one?  I don't know.  I've been in trains and stuff where everybody's around and stuff.  Did any of you guys ever feel her behind?  And no one ever did that.  Patty, you want him to feel your butt?  Did Jim ever feel your behind?  Awful.  Why does he do everything?  I don't know.  Because we didn't have Ron Jeremy in the studio at the time. 
[01:35:30]  Patty, why don't you let Ron just give a little brush on your butt?  How's Tushy?  Tushy's okay?  Bend over the chair.  As your attorney, I should point out that a lot of women get paid good money to touch  Ron Jeremy.  You're right.  Patty, what do you say?  That's very funny.  Lean over the chair and let Ron feel your butt.  As your attorney.  I'm so scared.  No, don't be scared.  You're at home over here.  You're safe.  I can do it there.  Yeah, there you go.  What do you think?  Nice?  Nice.  Did you do it through the pant leg?  Jeremy.  Jeremy.  His goose in her. 
[01:36:00]  Look at her.  She's squirming off a chair.  You have a lovely keister.  That's nice.  Did you get some stinky pinky?  No, I didn't do that.  Oh, that's very funny.  I didn't do that.  In Ron Jeremy's case, you can get pregnant just from that.  Just from what he just did.  I don't think so.  Yes, it is.  You wait ten months from now.  My God, what is it?  Thin mustache.  He kisses itself with a sundown sign.  She's filed for retroactive abortion, probably.  Sweet God, it's coming out of my vagina and it wants to be in legitimate films. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, my God.  Patty, how much fun is this?  Come on, Patty.  We ought to have a screening of one of Ron's films to Patty to let her understand what Ron does.  Do you like women?  Do you like ladies?  Do girls ever expect you?  Like girls?  No, I'm straight.  How about farm animals?  I'm just kidding.  I'm not.  Patty.  No, just kidding.  You want to make a film with Ron Jeremy?  No, she wouldn't do that.  No, I don't think that would be good.  Having any kind of sex for money would probably be very alien to you, I think.  Yeah, it would.  Yes, I understand.  It wouldn't be acceptable. 
[01:37:00]  I think if a guy, if you like a guy, how many dates would it take?  Let's say you do like a guy that's a little committed, three, four dates, he's a charming  guy, kind of like Richard and Jim.  About three to six months, so I get to know him, who he is, what he's about.  But you're supposed to show him every day for like a month.  Like a certificate of deposit.  Right.  Now, the dating period would have to be anywhere from three to six months.  That's for the whole nine yards.  How about just a little petting, kissing, grabbing?  Oh.  I would have to know him well enough and have a deep enough relationship with the person. 
[01:37:30]  How long is it going to be?  Any touch would have to be with love.  But now, speaking of D, would you do oral first or would it be intercourse first?  How long for a knob job?  Or how about if a guy does, how about if a guy pleasures you?  Yeah, how about that?  How long?  You have to wait a long time for a guy to pleasure you because he's doing all the work.  You're just lying back and going, oh baby, oh baby, oh.  It would have to be somebody I'm deeply in love with and I have a...  Wow.  Even for that.  Even for that.  Just take care of you.  Wow. 
[01:38:00]  But that's exactly what ruins it.  That's if he's based in love.  How about if he puts his hand on the vibrator and the vibrator pleasures you?  Oh, that's good.  You never had a vibrator in your whole life?  No.  Patty, we've got to get you one.  We've got to take a look.  There's no diseases from a vibrator.  It's all you.  You're alone.  We should give her a gift certificate.  Come again and pour him.  I think they'll give you a couple of vibrators.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Wait, someone on line 11 has something pretty funny.  Emily.  Yeah.  What's going on?  I've been listening to this show for so long and by the way she talks, I would never have 
[01:38:30]  guessed.  Patty, you are actually half Spanish?  Well, I'm part Spanish from my father's side.  You mean Spanish as in from Spain or Spanish as in Latina?  Latina.  Oh, okay.  That explains it because you certainly, I mean, I would never figure you for a hot Latina.  And I grew up, my parents watched me like a hawk too and first chance I got, honey.  I know.  A Spanish virgin.  They went a little bit deeper than that. 
[01:39:00]  It was like God would make things happen to me.  God would make things happen to me.  They wanted to teach me that way from a very early age to control me.  Got it.  They were elderly.  They were in their 60s when they had me.  Patty, can't you figure it out?  If God wasn't going to strike Timothy McVeigh down for what he did, I think you're okay.  Opie, he's dead.  How many boyfriends in 46 years?  Well, let me see.  Well, how old were you when you first kissed the guy?  Not right. 
[01:39:30]  I don't know, about 16.  Just like a little date.  That was a little old date.  A date?  A little peck on the cheek kiss or some tongue?  No.  You want some Ron Jeremy tongue?  No.  You guys are setting me up to be rejected here.  No.  This is downright mean.  This is the first time Ron Jeremy's I was never rejected.  It happens a lot, but this is downright mean.  And this guy's been with 85-year-old ladies.  I have had friends.  That was downright mean.  That was a nasty film, Ron.  Hey, look.  I was paid.  That's funny.  I know. 
[01:40:00]  Rosie, who is 85.  I have my limits, guys.  How old?  87.  Listen, guys.  Now, what she says is she says she can't find...  She advertised in the papers, true story, to find men her age.  She said, I can't find men my age to keep an erection.  I said, Rosie, guys, you've been dead for 10 years.  But the thing is, it was not just a lot of dialogue.  It wasn't even that much sex in that video.  She addresses World War I.  What video is it?  It was taxing.  It was 87 and still banging.  He had sex with an 87-year-old lady.  He had sex with an 87-year-old woman?  How?  Barely, for like three minutes.  As long as there's a lot of dialogue.  Trying to show that you're never too old to have fun. 
[01:40:30]  Right.  Be careful with that.  Very socially redeeming.  Have you seen Century Sex, Ron?  Have you seen Century Sex?  She's in that one, too.  Yeah.  Same woman.  Rosie's in that one, too.  So you're trying to tell me she wasn't 100 in that film?  She was 87 years old.  How did you like grabbing that E.T. body and just like, gravity is a bitch.  Oh, my God.  Gravity, man.  This planet sucks.  I'd be nervous, though, because one minute you're a porn star and the next minute, boom,  you're a necrophiliac.  Damn!  I think you brought her back to life three times during that. 
[01:41:00]  Massaged her heart from the other end.  I did a lot of talk shows about that, you know, and I was always saying in my defense,  wasn't Anna Nicole Smith of the guy in his 90s?  Yeah.  And the guys go, yeah, Ronnie, but not on film.  Right.  You were on film.  Look, it was a situation called karma, because now when I'm 87 years old, there'll be a lady  in her 40s who'll do me, I like to think.  Plus, I think it's good to be with an 87-year-old woman.  That's one of the only women that would encourage you to be quick.  Hurry up.  Hurry up.  Don't drag it out.  Before my teeth fall out.  I do want to ask you, this is true, how do you keep a rod when someone's 87 like that? 
[01:41:30]  Because if the phone rings, I'm limp for a half hour.  How do you keep an erection?  It's tough.  That was tough.  Was it?  I have to have some girls around.  I don't do a biogra.  I do.  A grip.  It's called a grip.  I know what you do.  It's called a grip.  Richie's seen a grip.  Imagine in your mind that you're having sex with a 72-year-old.  That's what keeps it goes.  I'll tell you the truth.  You go in another room, you look at a magazine, or you think of something with a good imagination,  and if you see a lot of film, right, if you see the film, 87 and Bang, you'll see  that my hand is gripping it almost the whole time.  I've got to ask Ron. 
[01:42:00]  One of the secrets.  Can you get turned down by Patty right this second?  She's an adorable shortcut, yeah.  Oh, my God.  No, I mean, like, it's concentration.  You find certain things that are nice about the person.  See, how many women are different, by the way, just so you know this, is the men can  break into body parts.  She has beautiful boobies, right?  You can look at those.  You can look at her rear end.  You can see men can look at women and find body parts and get excited.  Women can't do that.  With women liking a guy, they have to like the man, the whole guy, then look at, like,  his rear end, his front, back, face.  But women can't break into body parts like men can. 
[01:42:30]  So a lot of us guys can look at a girl and find something exciting about her, legs, top,  bottom, whatever, her face, and get turned on on just that, and have sex with her.  Women can never do that.  If there's something about the guy they don't like, they're turned off to the whole thing.  Now, wait a minute.  You are a pro.  That's a big difference.  Bless you, Ron Jeremy.  It's true.  It's true.  There's a guy like that.  I'll tell you the truth.  If a girl doesn't like a guy's, something about him turns him off.  Maybe they don't like his personality.  It's awful.  His face is terrible.  They're not going to like his schlong or anything else about him. 
[01:43:00]  Right.  You know, girls might like a guy's rear end, his front, whatever, but if something about  him they don't like, they'll turn it off.  Negates everything else.  With a guy, if he likes a girl's boobies or her back, he won't care.  She can be dribbling and not speak his name and think of foreign language.  He's going to have sex with her anyway.  So true.  You just need to like one part.  The biggest difference is between men and women.  Yeah.  You know, that Mars Venus thing.  Right.  Listen, we have to take a break.  Yeah.  Richard Jenny's in the studio.  He's playing Carolines this weekend.  Ron, where are you going to be?  Studio 54 tonight and tomorrow night.  Great little show, contests, audience participation. 
[01:43:30]  It's going to be a gas.  Are you just banging people?  No.  The show starts at 930.  What is this?  Well, Al Goldstein, no one's up for us.  He does a little shtick.  Al Goldstein does a few words.  I do a little shtick about the adult business.  You know, some comic, you know, attitudes and insights into porn.  Right.  And then we have Ringside Ryan does a comedy show.  We have a banana eating contest.  It's a bunch of crazy contests.  It's an erotic show, a sexy show.  And in a weird...  It starts exactly at 930.  They've got to be early, 930.  And in a weird twist, Richard Jenny's going to have sex on the stage at Caroline's. 
[01:44:00]  Right.  You're doing comedy.  Richard's going to hide the bacon.  Right.  Richard's going to have sex with an 87-year-old woman on the show at Caroline's.  And he's got to grip it, too.  And I'll use his jokes on my stage at 54.  All right.  We're coming back with everybody.  Jim Norton in the studio.  And Starca Patti, you heard us call out to you, right?  Yeah.  We have a proposition for you.  Okay.  And we're going to do it next.  We're going to see if you're brave enough.  Hey, the winner of the contest is Studio 54.  Take her home for the weekend.  And the loser gets me, Richard, for the week. 
[01:44:30]  Hey, you can put a girl on the rotisserie, you two, right?  Patti, you have a few minutes to think about, but you have to trust us.  It's a huge thing for you, okay?  Okay.  But it's a proposition.  And we're going to see how, you know, we're going to see if you're game for it.  You're game for this, okay?  We'll explain next as we go to the FU line.  Thanks for calling.  And this is the Opian Anthony FU Friday line.  Yes, I want to send a big FU to my boyfriend.  Rick, last night we had gay sex all night long, and he was so rough that I can't even walk today. 
[01:45:00]  And after that, he doesn't even leave a message or a note with me this morning after he leaves my place.  So FU to Rick, and next time we have gay sex, be more gentle.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to say FU to the effing tool that followed my wife into the freaking store on Whippin' Mount Wednesday  because my bumper sticker on my car and he followed her and harassed her  and then called her a bitch because she wouldn't flash him.  It doesn't work that way, you effing tool.  You leave them alone.  If they want to flash you, they will. 
[01:45:30]  Leave my f***ing wife alone.  And if you mess with her again, I'll f***ing find your ass.  I'll eff you, tool.  Next message.  I'd like to give an F out to the f***ing Mark Kelly.  They're putting motor oil in the stores that you've met.  I had some the other day.  It took two days to come out of my suit.  F them.  End of message.  Catch the best of Opie and Anthony.  Saturdays, 11 to 3.  1027 WNEW.  Anthony, the ultimate V.

In the studio, Richard Jenny playing all over the place.  Caroline's this weekend.  And then, um, Governor's on the 20th and the 21st.  And then the Stress Factory, 22nd through the 24th.  Also in the studio, Stalker Patty, 46-year-old virgin. 
[01:47:30]  And Ron Jeremy.  Ron Jeremy, who felt up Patty just moments ago.  Made her tingle.  I still have a liftoff.  I'm still erect from it.  Are you?  Still excited about it.  See?  There's something kind of exciting about that.  You know, if she had, like, a couple of hundred guys just broke the Houston record or something like that, it'd be different.  You know, but she's so never, you know, Richard, am I wrong about this?  Very innocent.  She's never done anything.  Man, Ron, you are a pig.  Kind of a pig.  Yeah, I guess I am.  Come on.  I guess I am, you know? 
[01:48:00]  I want you to have sex with Ron just so I can see the numbers change above his penis.  That McDonald's sign that you have there in your pubic hair.  The number changes on her, too.  Yeah.  One.  One.  One.  Imagine you wait all this time.  Zero to one.  You wait and wait for the right guy all this time.  And Ron Jeremy's your first.  Look, guys.  Tom Cruise wasn't available.  Brad Slate was busy, you know?  And with that tool, you're going to ruin her for the rest of her life.  It's like being afraid to drive, but you finally decide to get into a top fuel dragster. 
[01:48:30]  You know?  You know?  That's what it would be.  I like these.  You know?  Yeah?  This is good.  This is good.  It's better than that 87-year-old joke's before, you know?  All right.  Stalker Patty.  Yeah.  We told you to come down to the studio because we have a huge surprise for you, right?  Yeah.  Ron, if you will, could you stand up?  Oh, I have your...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Don't let her know.  Don't let her know anything.  Don't let her know anything.  I'm standing up.  Okay.  Patty, we got you a gift. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  I swear to God, we got you a gift.  Patty, who is your favorite, favorite band?  You two.  Right.  Okay.  We got a gift for you.  What?  But it's on Ron Jeremy right now.  So the good news and the bad news.  The good news is you got this band you can check out.  The bad news is you have to go up in my pants to get the tickets out.  You mean you got YouTube tickets down here? 
[01:49:30]  Right there.  Remember...  A little to the side.  If you really move your hand properly, you may not glaze against it.  Remember about 20 minutes ago, you refused to touch Ron Jeremy?  Yeah.  We have just upped the ante.  And I'm still depressed over that.  Upped the ante.  Are these in the loge?  They're right here, honey.  If these are in the loge, I'm going to spend it.  See, look.  On the outside.  See, look.  Here, put your hand right there.  That's the outside of the tickets.  See right there?  Those are the tickets.  But of course you have to go inside the pants to fill them out. 
[01:50:00]  So wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait, Patty.  Wait, wait, wait.  Oh, I...  Every girl has their price.  She didn't want anything to do with Ron Jeremy.  Look, she's now reaching like...  Ready to reach.  If you're really careful, you can avoid glazing the schmeckle.  But I get to see Bono, right?  You'll see Bono, right?  Yeah, you'll see that in two more seconds.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  We're not ready yet.  Not yet, Patty.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I get to hear one. 
[01:50:30]  Really put him in a good spot, Ron.  Put him in a good spot.  She's really, really careful she can get around it, but I don't give it easy.  You know what?  He's packing, don't you?  Oh, wait, wait.  Yeah.  Okay, he's okay.  All right, good.  Oh, my.  Yeah, well, you know, I get...  Ron, work him.  He's not exactly popping right now, but he's...  Work him a little bit, Ron.  Ron, you want us to give you a couple minutes?  Well, the envelope will fall out if I do that.  Oh, is it kind of...  If he sticks straight out, it's gone, you know?  The envelope hits the floor. 
[01:51:00]  This is great.  This proves a point.  Even Patty.  She's still going to get a handful of schmeckle, no matter what she does.  That's Jewish penis.  Tell him what you're doing.  Get out of here.  Patty.  All right.  It's yours.  Oh, my God.  All right, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Here goes stalker Patty reaching into Ron Jeremy to dig out the YouTube tickets.  I know it's for the tickets, not for me.  I realize that, honey.  Don't worry.  Patty, slowly reach in.  Don't hurt Ron.  Oh, she has no nails.  Good.  Don't.  She's just like a pig.  She just looked. 
[01:51:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Patty, I'm not wearing any underpants either.  Patty, you're also not allowed to look so you can pick them out.  You have to turn your head and reach in.  Hold on.  You know what would make this better?  Hold on.  What, Opie?  You know what would make this better?  Get a blindfold.  The edge.  Blindfold.  Blindfold.  Blindfold.  Blindfold.  It's no big deal.  This is great.  Stalker Patty even has a price.  Huh?  A price. 
[01:52:00]  I blew the game, Opie.  How were you going to play it?  Well, we didn't want to tell her what was in his pants, but that's okay.  Oh, would you have grabbed in there if you didn't know it was U2 tickets?  I doubt that.  It works this way as well.  We offered her before, and she turned it down, you know.  It's okay.  We're just getting a blindfold.  We're going to get a blindfold, so that way she can't pull the pants out and then look  and just grab the tickets.  Right.  Listen, Mark McGuire and Sammy Sosa sell their bowls for millions.  This is no big deal.  She's going to have to rummage around in there. 
[01:52:30]  I made Richard Jenny laugh.  I'm doing good.  God knows what you'll find.  I steal most of his jokes.  All right.  All right.  Stinky has the blindfold.  Let's blindfold.  Patty, take your glasses off.  Two-year-old virgin.  Patty.  Stalker Patty.  The glasses are off.  Why don't you get eye surgery?  Oh, yes.  I can't afford it.  Focus.  I don't have a lot of money for the look.  Honey, he's tying a jock supporter around your eyes right now.  That's a jock strap.  He just put it around your eyes.  The blindfold is on.  Steve is videotaping this for foundry music.  Patty, can you see? 
[01:53:00]  No.  Very good.  Now.  I see bottom.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Hold on.  Should we spin Patty around?  Yeah, spin Patty around a little bit.  Then around a little bit.  Put it on her earphone.  Yeah, get the headphones off.  Oh, now you're not going to be able to because they're inside the blindfold.  We've got to read.  Great.  You can spin on it.  It'll work.  All right.  Let's get the headphones off your head.  Put the blindfold back on.  There you go.  That's it, Ron.  Work that thing.  Work.  You should see.  Make sure it's coming.  Okay, good. 
[01:53:30]  Patty has never.  We're going to do it again.  I've got to do it right.  Patty has never.  Oh, no.  Never.  Never.  Yeah.  She's never had any kind of contact with that part of a man in her life.  Yeah.  All right, Patty.  Now I'm dizzy.  Patty's getting dizzy.  Now I'm dizzy.  I can't believe it.  I feel like I'm on a merry-go-round.  Oh, you'll be on a merry-go-round.  I can't believe it anymore, please.  Okay, the ticket's a win.  There you go.  All right. 
[01:54:00]  You follow my voice.  Hello, hello, hello.  Okay.  There she is.  She's on the stomach.  Oh, my God.  She's now touching Ron's stomach.  Oh, stop it.  She's going in his pants.  He's in his pants.  He went down.  Run down in his pants.  Ron, how much did she feel?  She glazed along the side of the swamp.  She brushed the side of the legendary Ron Jeremy song.  Here's the bad part.  Oh, my God.  John Tesh at Red Rocks.  Oh, God. 
[01:54:30]  He's my favorite fan.  Are you more excited about you two or that you finally touched man junk in all these years?  She's got it right to the side, man.  She's pretty good at that.  I don't think she's the version.  I don't know what I...  I don't know.  I don't know.  Tell you what.  A pound of beef and a bucket of balls.  She's done this before.  Tell you what we're going to do.  We're going to upgrade your tickets, Patty, to the front row, but...  You want a front row upgrade?  Open wide. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Look how excited she is.  That's only one ticket.  Here comes the second ticket.  She's crying because you finally touched man junk.  I'm going to see the edge.  You just saw the edge.  You just saw the edge.  I back to the edge.  Patty, what did it feel like on your hand?  I just felt a little hair.  I just felt a little hair.  She went right to the side of it.  Yeah, she got a little grip there.  Yeah. 
[01:55:30]  You didn't get my hand.  She did it so fast.  I'm not sure what it was or what part it was.  It's called schlong, Patty.  If you put the things back there again, you should have seen how many women that has invaded.  Hey, guys, now, listen, guys, now, if you have a $10 bill, which she buys her drinks with at the show.  Oh, Patty, how about some money for the...  For the parking and some beers?  What do you think?  You need a little money?  What do you think?  You want to fish down there for another $10?  But it's got to be right underneath the Jeremy Yam bag. 
[01:56:00]  You want the $10 for the drinks?  Yeah, let's get a collection up.  I don't have to park, but I'll have the $10 for coffee.  There we go, Patty.  Where should that be?  Ron, she works at McDonald's, so this is a big deal.  Where's the $10?  Who's going home?  Hold on.  All right.  Don't be afraid.  Just pretend you're the croc hunter and it sweeps weak.  I'm so happy.  Look, it's going into a death row.  Look at that bugger.  These spices have been invited and now he's going to attack. 
[01:56:30]  I'd like to see a fish for a...  I got $10.  I got $20.  How about you give her $40 quarters?  Let's see her fish that out.  All right.  I'll close it.  Turn around, Patty.  Wait.  Turn around.  Oh, Patty, look at this.  Let's offer a $20.  Back of yours.  That's us.  Look at her.  Patty, and $20 to enjoy the night out of seeing you two.  Yeah.  How about that, Patty?  Yeah, Bono.  Boner, Bono, whatever.  Here you go, Patty.  All right.  Now, where is it?  Ron, Ron, wait a minute. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  I don't want it to be this easy this time.  It was tough for this time.  Is it really like...  Oh, it is a little tough one.  We need it right by the taint.  It's tough for this time.  Is it?  Okay.  Now, is it a blindfolded again?  Yeah, Ron, Ron, wedge that in there.  Guys, if I was gay, I'd be sticking where the sun don't shine.  Ron, not.  Put it in that place that when in one of your movies, when the guys see that certain part,  they go, Jesus Christ, I wanted to see some chicks, not that.  The bob shot, you know.  Put it in the bob area.  Here, it's all yours, honey. 
[01:57:30]  Go ahead.  Back of...  Back of the yambang shot.  She doesn't need to head...  She's pretty good at this.  Oh, yeah?  She's good at...  Patty...  I think she's had...  She's had a good one.  Oh, my God.  Hey, honey, go to it, honey.  Jim, what are you laughing at?  All right, uh-oh, wait a minute.  The idea of this is great.  All right, hold on, Patty.  Patty is now going down his pants.  Go slow, honey.  Go too fast.  Her hand is down.  Oh, my God!  She just pulled her hand out.  She pulled her hand out like a feather. 
[01:58:00]  It's there, honey.  It's there.  I swear to God, she pulled her hand out of there so quick.  It's under the schlong.  You'll find it.  Patty, go ahead.  You've got to dig it out.  She thought it was a roll of quarters.  Patty, go get it.  You're too low.  Too low.  I've got to go higher.  You're too low.  Go up.  Got to go higher, honey.  It's underneath.  I swear to God, it's like something's nipping her.  She pulls her hand out of there so quick.  Patty, Patty, give Patty the mic a second.  Patty, Patty, what are you feeling? 
[01:58:30]  What are you feeling right now?  It scared me.  That's what a lot of women say.  She got a grip on it this time.  Did she?  Patty, what does that feel like?  Weird.  Is the 20 still in there?  Oh, it's still there.  It's still in there.  Patty, you're going to have to fish underneath.  You were close.  Give it a try, honey.  The deepest, darkest.  Now that I've tried your hand on it, honey, it's no big deal anymore.  Yeah.  Try the undercarriage.  Second fiddle, honey.  Get in there, Patty.  Let's go for it. 
[01:59:00]  Keep going.  Wait.  You're close.  A little lower.  A little lower.  Wait.  Wait.  To the right.  Okay.  There you go.  Wait.  To your right.  Again.  Wait.  Other way.  Other way.  Other way.  Other way.  A little lower.  A little lower.  She's got her hand on Roger.  She's got her hand on me.  Keep going.  A little lower.  She's got her hand on me.  She's got her hand on me.  Okay.  Now curl up a little bit.  It's right there.  Curl up.  She just pulled her hand out again.  She squealed and pulled her hand out.  She makes contact with Fletch. 
[01:59:30]  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on, Patty.  Hey, what's going on?  I've done a lot of radio shows in my day.  This really takes the cake.  I know.  All right, Patty.  46-year-old version Patty.  Patty.  Yeah.  What's the problem?  No, it's just something.  It's called Ron Jeremy.  She called all the right spots.  Get out of the way, and it's underneath waiting for you.  This is for $20, so you can enjoy the U2 show.  You've got to get it out of the way, huh? 
[02:00:00]  Patty, after you do this, we're going to show you where that's been.  We'll roll a few videos.  You've got to go on there, then.  You can't escape touching it.  I don't see it.  Higher.  Higher.  Go get it, Patty.  Come on.  You pulled her hand out again.  Patty.  I'm not going to leave you for it.  I'll put it right there.  No, no, no.  Patty, you're going to have to lift up where.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You're going to bleep that.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty. 
[02:00:30]  What is the problem?  Yeah, what's the problem, Patty?  I don't know why.  I've just never done anything like this before in my life.  Neither has Ron for $20.  This is a no one for both of us.  Neither has Andrew Jackson.  All right.  She's back in there.  She's back in.  To your left.  My left is this way.  Yes.  Go to your left.  That's it.  That's it.  Now, go underneath.  You're there.  Go a little more underneath.  You've got to get it out of the way, honey.  You can't avoid it.  Come on, honey.  You have to go underneath.  Come on.  Grab.  Don't be afraid of it. 
[02:01:00]  It's not going to bite.  Just nibble.  Come on, Patty.  You're real close.  It's not really close.  Keep going.  Patty's like on a...  Up.  Right there.  Under there.  A little more.  Patty.  You've got to use it.  Oh, my God.  She's right in there.  She got it.  She got it.  She got it.  Oh, my God.  Why does it look like it's got strudel icing on it?  Oh, that was downright meat.  That's a winner.  It's perfectly clean. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, my God.  There's nothing more?  Well, there's nothing I have that she hasn't grabbed.  Let's put it that way.  Yeah.  Patty.  I feel so much closer now.  Don't you?  Patty, that was the first time you've ever been in that area, right?  How did it feel?  How did it feel?  Weird.  It felt a little weird.  Would you ever let a guy fish anything out of your bottoms?  No.  Not yet.  Tomorrow.  How about for another 20? 
[02:02:00]  Stop it.  This keeps going.  Patty.  For another 20.  If we put a 20 down the front of your pants and Ron fishes it out, we'll give it to you also.  This keeps going until she's bleeding from the blood.  And he's behind her going, do you want popcorn or don't you?  Do you want refreshments or not?  Make up your mind.  Stinky, go get my wallet.  Go get my wallet.  I got a 20.  I got one.  You'll pay me later.  Okay.  Yeah. 
[02:02:30]  You want another 20 bucks, Patty?  So far, she's fished out.  You two tickets.  By the time we get to 100, it's going to be an eight-man interracial dwarf.  Here it is now.  She's going to break Houston's record by the time we leave today.  Want to pass that on over?  There you go.  That's the clean one.  Okay.  All right.  Patty, what are you paying?  What you've got to do is put it in an area, the same type of area Ron had his 20 in.  It's got to be right there.  Look, I'm manicured.  See, manicured.  Don't put it in the front.  It's got to be right on the undercarriage, if you know what I mean, and not interfered by 
[02:03:00]  any clothing or anything.  And then Ron will go in there and grab the 20 out, and that 20 will also be yours.  I'm shaking.  You've got to stand up.  You've got to stand up, honey.  You'll really be shaking later.  You've got to stand up.  You've got to...  Should I kiss the back of your neck when I do this?  All right.  Yeah, give her the reach around.  Get her with the reach around.  Oh, no, not the reach.  Wait, wait.  Turn around.  You don't want Ron to know where you're putting it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I won't look, guys.  But, Norton, you make sure she's putting it way under there. 
[02:03:30]  All right, Patty, you've got to stand up.  I'm not looking.  Patty, that's got to go right on the Mason-Dixon line.  You know what I mean?  Take the blindfold off.  Go ahead.  You've got to go under the panties.  Right on the equator.  I don't care.  You've got to put it down.  Deep down.  Deep down.  No, Patty, that's still in front.  You've got to go right under.  Underneath.  Under.  Make believe it's a Maxi.  Oh, my God.  Flying on the wings of a Maxi.  Patty, 46-year-old virgin.  Let's blindfold Ron.  Okay.  It's only fair.  It's only fair, Ron.  It's only fair.  If I'm worth my stuff, I should be able to find it. 
[02:04:00]  Really?  Where's the blindfold?  Count Ron's rings.  Make sure they're all there when he pulls his hands back out.  I would have to care of that.  Oh, you took them off.  I don't want to lose them down there.  Of course not.  We're blindfolding Ron.  Patty has hidden a $20 bill.  Yeah.  Right on the undercarriage.  We're talking right where every automotive needs rust-proofing.  The 46-year-old virgin Patty. 
[02:04:30]  Okay.  All right.  Patty, you ready for this?  All right.  All right, Jim.  Jim, make sure you're Mike Patty.  All right.  Ron now searching.  Going down on the belly.  He is now finding the panty line.  There he goes.  He is.  Oh, my God.  Whoa!  Patty is freaking out.  I'm not sure yet.  Oh, my God.  Patty can't believe it.  She's in shock.  Ron's Jeremy's hand firmly down her pants. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, my God.  She's buckled over, doubling over her mouth, agape.  Oh, my God.  Have you ever seen Patty like this?  This is unbelievable.  She's like, dude, she's enjoying this.  She just had to know.  I think she just owed.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I'm almost there.  She's almost got it, Patty.  She's almost got it.  You've got to stand up there.  Stand up, I still.  Come.  He's almost got it, Patty. 
[02:05:30]  You're going to U2.  You're going to have $40 spending money, Patty.  I'm so surprised Ron can't find it, Ed.  Yeah, Ron.  I can't find it?  I thought you were an expert at this time.  Oh, my God.  I think you lost the ring that time.  Oh, she's twitching.  She's twitching.  This is one small step for a man.  She's on the floor.  Oh, no.  Did you get it? 
[02:06:00]  Yes.  He got it.  He got it.  Oh, my God.  Hey, wait a minute.  That's two tens.  She made change.  Hey, Richard.  Patty.  Hey, wait a minute.  I certainly earned that.  Now, how much will you give me if I smell Jeremy's fingers?  Now, Patty, I've got to put it on close. 
[02:06:30]  Patty, how did that feel?  Where?  I'm weird again.  Listen, I've got to say in all fairness, I wasn't too much there, but I could tell she  was a little on the excited stage.  Is that true?  Patty, did you feel a little excitement there, Patty?  Be honest.  It feels very.  How do I say this delicately?  She wasn't totally dry.  Let's put it out.  You got a tingly feeling?  Yeah.  She did.  That's a tingle.  She broke my mouth.  She broke my mouth.  That's where it starts.  Well, Ron could take care of that, too.  We have a cure for that. 
[02:07:00]  There's a protein paste that takes care of the...  She wasn't totally unexcited.  Let's put it that way.  You can tell, right?  Yes.  I think she might be sticking to the seat as we speak.  Patty, now, did that feel kind of good and kind of different?  What do you think?  Patty?  It felt different.  Different, but was it something...  Different good or different bad?  Different, I don't know what.  Different in a different denomination.  Different weird.  Patty.  Have you ever had that done to you? 
[02:07:30]  No.  No.  And it's Ron Jeremy, the first guy to touch it.  Man, are you going to be disappointed after today?  I think we should all join hands and sing We Are the World.  Right.  Absolutely.  I cannot believe the first person to touch her peach was Ron Jeremy.  How often has she been in the studio?  She's been coming in here for three years, just about.  Yeah, but this time she really did come in here.  Get those pictures up on the website immediately.  Yeah, and usually virgins are like that, by the way. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Sure.  They get turned on very easily.  Oh, God.  Fantastic.  Well, Patty, you not only got U2 tickets and $40 to spend at the show, but you got...  Now, guys, let me ask you this.  If she puts another bill down there, I attach crazy glue to the penis.  That was funny.  Okay, just kidding.  Patty, you felt something there that you never felt before, right?  Most guys have to come into money.  Fishing for dollars, right? 
[02:08:30]  You felt something you never felt before.  Holy ass.  And it was kind of exciting.  It's kind of strange.  Do you shave?  I mean, do you shave, like, for summer, for bathing suits and stuff?  Yeah, I do.  Because it wasn't a big...  It didn't seem like a virginal, you know.  Most virginals usually like a lot of hair.  She did not have that much.  No, she's all ready to go.  You're shaving for bathing suits.  The car's gassed up, pointed in the right direction.  You guys have seen her below the waist?  No, no, I haven't. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, we have.  We got pictures of it.  Totally nude?  Yeah.  She has a nice physique.  Well, there's a photo of me in the whipped cream bikini.  You're very sexy, honey.  Some guys will be very happy when he finally plays a game of hide the bacon with you.  And shoot the sherbet and drain the main vein.  He's a very happy fellow.  Un-effing believable.  Who thought the day would come?  Three years ago, when Patty first came in here, we said, in three years, Ron Jeremy's  going to put his hand down the front of your pants and touch that area. 
[02:09:30]  She would have said no way.  Anybody here would have...  Except her up in the future.  Ron, you may leave the studio and attack the first homeless guy she sees on the bench.  Ron, you don't even know how great that was.  I was having a good time.  You don't even know.  Yeah.  Hey, glad to be with assistants.  Rick is previewing some of the pictures.  Nice.  Get those on the website.  Patty, you enter a long, illustrious line of ladies that have had that done to them.  This man has been in 666 films. 
[02:10:00]  Wow.  Adult films.  I saw on the Internet Movie Database, 666.  No, they're putting in mainstream and adult.  I've done 1,700 adult.  Jesus Christ.  55 mainstream.  1,000.  How many different women would you say you've been with in your career?  We'll see.  There's 1,701.  You want to go actually like me, or else I don't get paid.  Oh, nice.  You can't count that high.  That is great.  I'm just looking at a couple of the pictures.  If I had to count the amount of the virgins I've been with in my entire life, very, very 
[02:10:30]  few.  Yeah.  All of us, what would you guys say?  How many would you say, right?  Very few.  Richie, how many virgins do you think you're ever with in your whole life?  Zero.  There's a few.  A couple?  One.  I'd say just a couple when I was a kid.  One?  No, I was a virgin, yeah.  My friend told me that to understand that the first time I have it with the guy, I  may not be his first because of my age and his age.  Right.  Well, chances are, when you're 46 years old, you don't have a hymen probably.  I mean, you've done energetic stuff.  You do calisthenics.  You ride horseback.  Yeah, of course.  When you have your time again, you use... 
[02:11:00]  You've had Ron Jeremy dig for a $20 bill.  Yeah, yeah.  So, chances are, she probably doesn't have a hymen.  There's no way you could prove that a girl's a virgin.  Check your pointer.  You want that?  At 46 years right there.  At 46 years of age, you're not going to be able to see that a girl's a virgin.  That's what she says.  Patty, you want Ron to see if you have a hymen?  Oh, that's okay.  I probably don't because of the tampon use.  I could check, honey.  I could tell if you want.  I could tell, you know.  Please, if she had one, it would look like a Pringles.  Thank you.  Listen, guys, I'll tell you, I think right now, he could put a dollar there.  She'll probably do it for that. 
[02:11:30]  No.  Wow.  I am so amazed that that ever even happened.  For one dollar, you can get her like five sticks of bubblegum.  So, what do you say?  Wow.  All right.  We should take a break.  How do you pay?  If you pay us $20, I'll fish for...  Okay.  Let's take a break and hose off.  Yeah, we got to get Richard Jenny out of here.  He's playing Caroline's all this weekend.  He did a great job for us today.  See, Richard, it turned out okay.  It turned out all we're just fine.  We got off to an obnoxious start.  And it turned out really well.  Richard Jenny will be at Caroline's all this weekend. 
[02:12:00]  Governors, Wednesday and Thursday, the 20th and the 21st.  And then Stress Factory in New Jersey, June 22nd through the 24th.  Check him out.  Funny guy.  May the Lord squat on your life and spray his blessings upon you.  Thanks, Richard.  Richard Jenny.  Jenny, excuse me.  And you're hanging around, right, Ron?  Yeah.  We got more fun with Ron Jeremy.  A little time left in just a bit.  We got some versions coming down.  I like that.  Oh, yeah.  But first, it's the F.U. line.  Go f*** yourself.  And here's the Opie and Anthony F.U. Friday line.  I like to put a big F.U. out for my girlfriend, Lori. 
[02:12:30]  I have to catch Nicole Friday night.  I wake up there screaming at the mess I made.  A whole box of tissues from blowing my nose all night.  That turns into me getting a teacup broken over my face.  And then me explaining all to the police who show up that she's pissed.  They have to tell me to get away from her.  They run my place and find an insurance last and subsequently arrest me for the weekend.  I got sick, beat up from my girlfriend, and arrested all the same weekend.  So F.U.  Lori, and it is your fault.  Next message.  F.U. to the phone company managers from Brooklyn. 
[02:13:00]  They made us take the wow stickers off the truck.  What the f*** are we supposed to do for enjoyment?  You pieces of s***.  We try to enjoy ourselves during the day.  Now we cut tables all weekend.  F.U. to the phone company managers.  Next message.  Hey, don't worry for a cell phone company.  I say F.U. to every customer I've ever had.  You know what?  They give you brain cancer.  We hear everything you say.  And we f*** up your bills on purpose.  End of message.  O.P.  Anthony.  107. 
[02:13:30]  WNEW.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What a day, what a day, what a day.  Yeah.  Ron Jeremy in the studio.  Guys, I miss Patty already.  She's been gone only 30 seconds and I kind of miss her.  Yeah.  No, she left the trail on the way out the door.  Victor, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Great show.  Thank you.  What did I learn?  Oh, yeah.  YouTube tickets.  $200.  $40 in spending money.  Yeah.  Ron tweaking the peach. 
[02:14:00]  Priceless.  Absolutely priceless.  Very good, Victor.  Thank you.  Take care, guys.  The whole, just the whole thing of her never having had a man's hand anywhere near that  area.  Oh, I was right on it.  Yeah.  You know, I didn't do anything going anywhere in.  Right.  I was right on it.  And I'm telling you, it was not, it was, it was on the damp side.  Can I say this?  Usually that, usually that's hot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, Jim Norton in the studio as well.  You can sweat when you think of Patty.  You're seeing the new, see the thing, Ron, you're seeing like this new outgoing Patty. 
[02:14:30]  The Patty that was here was like this new outgoing Patty that we don't even really know.  Well, next time you guys have her at the studio, you know, more tickets, more fun,  more dollars.  Right.  You know, I'm telling you, next time there'll be an eight man, you know what I'm saying.  You're going to pass her on like a raffle ticket.  You'll see.  I want to do the gangplank contest.  James, what's up?  Hey, guys, I learned something new today.  Yeah.  Unless you guys mark those bills, never touch a $20 bill again.  Yeah, you know something? 
[02:15:00]  You never, when mom told you to keep the money out of your mouth because you don't know where it's been,  someone is going to grab a 20 that was underneath Ron Jeremy's sack of the president on the bills going,  what's the deal here?  And you'll know the one that was in Patty's pants.  He's holding his nose.  What?  See, he's being flagged because I'm sitting here, you know.  As you were here, I wasn't.  If I was on the drive home, I'd be saying Ron's pants.  No, I trash her, I believe it.  Hey, who's this?  Who's this?  ONA Swallow from the message board. 
[02:15:30]  Hey, what's going on, bro?  Guys, if this was not the funniest effing thing that's ever been on the radio, nothing is funny.  You've got to see the video and the pictures because it's just beyond funny when you get the visual.  I'm going to be looking in Philadelphia.  If you don't get it after this, you never will.  There you have it.  This is all you're going to get.  Thank you, man.  She really was blindfolded, too.  Yeah, blindfolded.  She was groping around a little bit.  That was so funny.  When she pulled her hand out of there three, four times.  Every time she'd grab, she'd put it around and she'd keep a distance from the flesh. 
[02:16:00]  Right.  Then she would grab the flesh and yank it right out.  But she was curious.  Yeah.  You'd grab it and go, ah!  Then grab another piece, ah!  It's like a little kid touching the light socket.  It's like when something nips you.  There was no part of the male anatomy she didn't check out.  Really?  Everything?  Oh, she got a piece.  A stem to stern.  Hey, where's Steve from foundrymusic.com?  He's scrolling through the pictures right now to put some up on film.  Steve?  Oh, really?  Okay.  Are any on NEW.com?  No.  Not yet.  Not yet.  Not yet. 
[02:16:30]  And of all the mules to grab for the first time in your life.  I know.  That's the best part.  The best was Ron was working it up while she was delightful.  I gave her a couple of tugs.  I got a reputation after a poll.  Right.  Your mule is bigger after a cold shower than mine is hard.  You know how embarrassing that is?  Uncle John, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Absolute classic, man.  Absolute classic.  Cool.  You know, I always knew that someday Patty was going to come into money.  For you guys.  Quite literally. 
[02:17:00]  Very nice.  Let's go to Rich.  The phones are just going nuts here.  Rich.  Hey, what I learned today.  Yeah.  Ron Jeremy can turn the worst show into the best show.  You had ultimate cringe radio happen until he walked in the studio.  Yeah, but the cringe radio was good with Richard Jenning.  He's good.  No, it wasn't as good as some cringe radio you guys have had in the past.  Yeah.  Well, that's why you got to listen to this whole show.  You never know when it's going to turn.  Man, Rich and Jim are funny guys, man.  No choice about it. 
[02:17:30]  I slimed up the show.  That's all.  All right.  Do you ever just show girls your mule?  If I had that pack of nine and a half, all I would do is just show people.  What happens occasionally, and Natalie has seen this once in a while, when a girl, they  won't just come up to you and say, hi, let me just do you.  They might just say, can I see it?  So my standard line is, well, show me yours.  I'll show you mine.  And they'll say, well, I'm not in the business.  And I'll say, yeah, but I clocked out.  So then we'll go somewhere private.  And this does happen a bit, where they'll flash and I'll flash.  And it may lead to something a little sexual. 
[02:18:00]  It might not.  Maybe they'll grab.  Maybe they'll do something more than that.  Or maybe they'll just look at it and go, oh, thanks.  And they'll leave.  But that does often lead to a little playful stuff once in a while.  Weren't you a special ed teacher?  Yes.  Yeah, right here in Queens, right here in New York.  I went to Queens College.  Got 32 graduate credits.  Master's degree.  Never got the actual piece of paper, but got the credits done.  Should we see if he has a sense of humor, Ed?  No, I taught retarded kids all over New York and Catskills.  Yeah.  Wow.  A year and a half, taught retarded children.  Wow.  Rewarding career.  Then I quit and did theater here.  Right.  Went from theater to Playgirl magazine, 1978, when I was skinny. 
[02:18:30]  Well, your girlfriend sent in a picture of your mural, right?  Right, right.  And the rest is history?  From the Paramount Hotel in Parksville, up in the Catskills.  Sent in a picture of Playgirl, published in 1978, October.  Yeah.  And most of the girls I worked with were sperm, you know.  And now they want me in the field and the stream.  Now, this is when I was skinny, you know, back then.  The four times I was on Playgirl.  And that started the career.  And then I stopped teaching.  That started the...  Yeah.  And he did comedy.  Ron did comedy at one point.  I did a little, you know.  I did, like, our audition at the comics trip when Jerry Seinfeld was the emcee. 
[02:19:00]  And then when Lonnie Hanover, before he had scores, you know, he was working at the Good Times.  And he used to run that place.  I did a little comedy there with Yakov Smirnoff and Dice Clay way back.  What a penis.  Yakov.  You know how encouraging that is as a comic?  To go from stand-up...  I want to drink vodka and stare at his penis.  What is that, Yakov?  Hey, Jerry, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing, okay?  Yeah.  I'm a up-and-coming film star myself.  I've done a couple of movies for Vivid.  I just wanted to say that Ron Jeremy is not only my hero, but he's probably the greatest adult film star ever. 
[02:19:30]  Well, this is very flattering.  I don't think I put you guys up to this.  No, I mean, I mean...  You've never met.  Ron, I have...  No, no, this is not a paid phone call.  I just...  I think the way you handle yourself, the way you've handled yourself throughout the years,  a lot of the criticism you've taken, sometimes at the awards publicly, you've never stooped to the level of shooting back at them.  Well, thanks.  What's here for Vivid?  You're here in New York?  Yeah, exactly, right.  I'm here for three weeks, right.  Are you from L.A.?  Exactly, yeah.  What's your name?  What's your stage name? 
[02:20:00]  Don't be embarrassed.  I got on as Jerry Butler, which is a very old friend of yours, but I come on as Jerry Longsworth.  And you worked...  Who'd you work with?  You worked with a Vivid girl?  I'm sorry?  You worked with a Vivid girl?  Yeah.  Who'd you work with?  Deborah Shaday.  She's new.  She's only got three films under her belt.  Who else?  Who else?  Yeah, so right now I'm doing Wiggles and I'm doing Goldfingers over in Queens, you know,  some promo work this weekend and next weekend.  You're a male dancer?  I was at one time, yeah.  Yeah, that's how I broke into it.  Yeah, exactly.  Very good.  Got to be in California to get that work, though. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, you're definitely a hero in the industry.  And listen, tell Opie you are not a hedgehog.  Hedgehogs are in Petland Discount.  You are the warthog.  Oh, that's even better.  Oh, great.  Listen, are you going to come to Studio 54 tonight?  I've had something going down.  I've gotten a phone call on my cell phone before, but will you be there?  Yeah, I'm doing a show there tonight, tomorrow night.  Studio 54.  Me, Al Goldstein, a bunch of pretty ladies, you know.  Oh, I was going to be there.  It's an S&M show.  Come on down.  Schmooze a little bit, right?  Comedy, got S&M, got erotica.  Do they have a list at the door or no?  Come on down.  You're there.  Thank you, Jerry.  Yeah, thank you.  All right, man. 
[02:21:00]  Bye-bye, guys.  Ron, you're the king.  Thank you.  I didn't call you a hedgehog.  I'm getting pissed off now.  I say a lot of things.  I was talking in that article that you were reading.  I don't mind that.  People call me that because I'm hairy.  I don't care.  You know, the word hog is so misconstrued.  They're kind of cute, aren't they, little hedgehogs?  When they bang 1,700 women, they are, yeah.  Are hedgehogs kind of cute, Natalie?  Natalie likes them.  Hey, Steve from foundrymusic.com.  Did you get good footage of that whole mess with Patty and Ron Jeremy?  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  Your site is going to be busy tonight. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, I believe so.  You've got to see the visual of what just happened in the studio.  We were looking at a couple of the pictures over here.  There's one I'm looking at right now.  Wait until you see those people.  It's Patty covering her face, Ron's arm just buried down her pants.  And she looks like she's, doesn't that look like a still from a porno movie?  It absolutely does.  Yeah, she's got that look on her face.  She's got the Carrie look on her face.  You heard of Debbie Does Dallas?  We'll be seeing Patty Does New York very soon.  Yeah.  Very soon.  46-year-old version. 
[02:22:00]  You should have done that stance where you put the one hand on your hip and grab her.  Oh, you guys know that.  Get the hair out of the way.  That is such a great move.  The guy's got to see it.  I think every guy has tried the Ron Jeremy move.  You've got the one hand on the hip.  The one hand's got to go on the hip and you're just banging.  The light's got to get in there.  That's it.  I say, Ronnie, we're losing daylight.  Come on.  Get that thing going.  All right.  Let me move my arm here.  You've got to see it.  And the hair thing when the aural's going on.  You've got to push that hair away.  You've got to see it.  The master.  Oh, and there's a picture of Patty with her hand down Ron's pants grabbing some junk. 
[02:22:30]  That's very funny.  Did she have a nice touch?  It was funny because it was a shaky touch.  Yeah, she was shaking.  Like exploring for the first time.  Yeah.  She'd grab it, then fly her hand out.  So she'd be on it for a second, and she knew what it was.  And she'd go, ah!  Reminds you of one of those students from the 70s, doesn't it?  Yeah, then she'd grab another part.  But as I said in that movie, she had both the Franks and the beans.  Ah, everything. 
[02:23:00]  Hey, dude, does Peter North take something?  There's a rumor he takes something to get his stuff to shoot.  Everyone asks that.  Well, he says egg white.  But the thing is, you know, I love when guys ask me that.  How do I shoot more?  And I always say, why?  You think your girlfriend really cares?  No, it's more degrading.  If you're in real life.  It's more degrading.  They go, yeah!  Get a towel!  That's disgusting!  What's most important for real life is how it feels.  You know, you want it to feel good.  Not how much shoots.  But if you really want it to shoot more, what you just do is you hold back.  You get real close to letting go and stop.  Get real close to letting go and stop. 
[02:23:30]  And keep doing that a few times, and by the time you let go, then squeeze it a little bit.  And when you finally release, it's going to shoot far and a lot.  Look at that.  There you go.  I don't know what.  But so what?  Sex advice for Ron German.  That's good for the movies.  Hey, Ron does.  But for real life, it's not important.  Norton uses that technique a lot.  He's got to stop every time they regain consciousness and clock them again.  And then he goes, goes, gets close.  They start screaming.  Clock them again.  If they're awake, they'll down 9-1-1.  Oh, my God.  There's a picture of Ron's pants being pulled away. 
[02:24:00]  You can almost see something there.  And Patty's bony elbow.  They better put that picture on the website.  You can see her hand is right on it.  She's elbow deep.  You can't see it, but her hand is right on it.  Hey, Ron, does size matter?  You know what's funny?  Not really.  I mean, you know, there's some girls who are size queens and some girls actually might like it.  But to tell you the truth, the majority of girls will say it's not the boat, but the motion of the ocean.  Most girls will take a good lover who's good at what he does, a good tongue.  You know, having a big one, some girls might be size queens, but the vast majority, no. 
[02:24:30]  More guys worry about it than girls do, really.  You know, more guys are nervous about it.  It hurts more on us.  You never know.  I'm sure you guys have never known a girl that would look at you and go, what are you going to do with that little thing?  I mean, you've never had problems, right?  Well, some of us have.  It doesn't matter that much.  Honest to goodness, it's good for show.  Right.  Some girls like it.  You know, they're called size queens, I guess.  Size queens?  Some girls will like the size, but the vast majority, no.  They'd rather have a guy who's nice and knows what he's doing, good in bed, nice tongue.  I don't know.  Likes to please them. 
[02:25:00]  They would take a guy who's small, who's into pleasing them, than a guy who's large and go, thanks.  Yeah, right.  Taxi, cab fare.  I'm done.  It's true.  I'm saying, ask any girl.  They want to consider a guy more than a guy who's big.  That's coming from a guy that's...  I'm telling you, they'll be...  Coming from a guy.  That's easy to say when you have a small Haitian in your pants.  Oh, my God.  I can't wait till these get up.  They're going through the pictures here, so every time I glance over, I see a new one. 
[02:25:30]  And it's just more of Patty just being turned on so much.  These pictures will be up on WNEW.com and FoundryMusic.com.  Foundry Music also has video.  Video of this.  That's a good one.  Oh, my God.  Look at this one.  I've got to see this.  Look at this one.  She's trying to hide her face, it looks like.  You are...  Your arm is buried.  I think I lost one of my rings.  You went right...  You went right to the area.  Yeah.  You were right there.  Yeah, I sort of has manicured... 
[02:26:00]  Notice I was manicured now, so I sort of...  Very good, yeah.  But she would think I was being a vegan gentleman.  Were you tempted to...  I'll tell you, I was right there.  Go for it.  I was right on the outside, and I could actually see that she was, you know...  And I was...  It was right on the very edge.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was...  I'm telling you, it was almost tempting.  Did you push a button a little bit?  A little.  Yeah, yes, yes.  A little twitching.  Because I saw her kind of...  No, no, no.  I was on the button for sure.  You are?  I was actually back and forth on the button.  Oh, my God.  No, I was trying to get her going a little bit.  I want to see if she can get a little excited.  She looked like she was going into an epileptic fit.  No, I was definitely on the button.  Yeah. 
[02:26:30]  But when I got to the actual, you know, space itself, I was just on the outside there.  That's hilarious, man.  Did you get a face on her, though?  It was just that mouth open and that...  Her mouth was open so wide, and she was almost dry heaving, it looked like.  She was convulsing.  I can't wait to see the video.  Are you constipated or having an orgasm?  That was the worst face I've ever seen on a human.  Tony, what's going on?  Hey, it's Camacho.  I just want to say, what I learned today, my mother taught me never, ever put money in my mouth  because I never know where it's been.  That's right. 
[02:27:00]  Someone's going to get a 20.  Tony, where are you this weekend, Norton?  What's that?  Where are you this weekend?  I don't know.  You called in...  This is how dumb Tony is.  He puts me in Rascals tonight, and then he calls in and plugs Jenny at Caroline.  Brilliant move.  I like Tony.  He's a nice booker.  I love you both, man.  But even the space factory is better.  I love you both.  All right, man.  No, Jim, you're playing Rascals tonight, right?  West Orange.  Yeah, I wasn't even going to mention it.  That's okay.  Thanks, Tony.  Thank you, brother.  All right, let's go to Chris.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, guys. 
[02:27:30]  What's up?  Hey.  I just wanted to play what I learned today.  Yeah.  I learned Anthony bought his dad a coffin for Father's Day.  You got cable for his coffin.  All right.  Dr. Buster Hyman from Pennsylvania.  Hey, guys, I learned that Ron Jeremy's schlong doesn't bite.  It just spits.  It was nipping at Patty, though.  Yeah, let's go to...  It's so funny how quickly she pulled her hand out of there after she got a little gription  on what was going on in Ron Jeremy's pants.  Let's go to Kevin.  Kevin, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, Bowen A?  Hey.  Listen, quick, what I learned today. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  I learned that Ron Jeremy actually has a ferret down his pants.  A ferret.  Nipping her like a ferret.  A hedgehog with a ferret.  That works.  Some kind of mammal.  All right, bro.  All right.  Yeah, there's nothing else we can do after what we just learned.  I know.  How the hell do you follow that?  Impossible.  Someone puts their hands down Jim's pants.  Yeah, maybe if you put OzFest tickets in Ron's colon and I have to go in for him.  You know what?  Good luck.  We got the tickets.  Hey, there you go.  I got the colon. 
[02:28:30]  You know what?  You get me to meet Sabbath, I go in for him.  No hands.  It's Ethan Tongue.  I'm an Aussie fan, brother.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Nice.  We'll make a film, Romeo and Julio.  And dude, Holmes did gay porno at the end.  I know.  I know.  Also, he had a problem, too, by the way.  You know.  What?  Well, he had a disease, you know.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  I know.  Just a little disease.  We didn't know that he actually, you know, would do that.  It was kind of a surprise when he did a gay film.  And he had a gay lover when he was in jail, supposedly.  Both passed away, you know. 
[02:29:00]  So it was a shock.  Did you panic, though, after you heard that?  Like, oh, man, we were some of the same girls?  No, he was not in the business for years.  He was out a couple of years.  In fact, it was funny because, again.  Yeah, it's not like that AIDS stuff can sit there for a few years.  Yeah, no, it announces itself on the way out.  Sam Kenniston made a very funny joke about that.  He goes, you know, he goes, John Holmes has, like, thousands of women.  And, you know, gets paid.  And there's beautiful girls all over the world.  He switches to gay sex and heroin.  That's what we call bad career management.  And he goes, no one really got upset when John Holmes died.  The man with the biggest, the biggest white man with the biggest schlong dies. 
[02:29:30]  So now every white guy steps up one notch.  No one really got upset.  It's all graded on a curve.  Yeah.  Hey, why don't you have a girlfriend, Ron?  Well, you know, it's tough to, Natalie is a very close friend of mine.  I mean, it's hard to have a monogamous relationship while you're in the business.  Like, again, what do you say?  Like, you know, you're, oh, honey, I really enjoyed breakfast.  I'm going to go do Seca.  See you Thursday.  A lot of girls don't want to put up with that.  It's tough to have a relationship.  You know, me and Natalie are very close friends. 
[02:30:00]  I have a friend in New York named Venice.  I mean, I have a lot of dynamite friends.  But to really have a serious monogamous relationship, you can't really be in this world.  Even if you just direct the movies, don't even act in them.  It's just tough.  Right.  When you're amongst that all the time, you know, you have to be really open.  God, do I want to be you.  And in directing them, do you get to audition the girls?  No, you know, that doesn't exist in adult movies.  It doesn't more mainstream.  Maybe in the old days, was it like that?  Listen, girls in porn are making more money than the directors and producers are making.  They're making a killing with the websites, the personal appearances, the dancing, the featuring.  The girls are making a quarter million a year. 
[02:30:30]  Some of them are even more.  Wow.  So you can't go to some girl and go, hey, baby, you got a cue.  Why don't you come in and eat this?  I'll put you in a movie.  They'll fire you and hire a different director.  I'm telling you, it's...  Wow, it's gotten so real.  Jesus.  The girls, the concert girls pretty much run the business.  But years ago, was it more like that?  It was more, I guess, more men in raincoats type of thing, yeah.  But you wouldn't actually pull a casting couch, because people wouldn't fall for that.  No.  No, they wouldn't.  You know, the sex took place on the camera, not like behind the scenes.  There might be that going on, but it wouldn't be like, you want a job, honey? 
[02:31:00]  Eat this.  That didn't work.  No one pulled that.  Hmm.  You know?  Fascinating.  I love that industry.  Don't you?  Isn't it fascinating?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, a lot of the material I do, again, at Studio 54 is about the business.  Yeah.  You know, some of the insights and some of the comic insights about how bizarre it really  is.  It's getting good reviews.  Yeah.  What you do...  I've done it all over the country, Canada.  And it's a shtick.  I'm not a comedian, like, compared to Jim or Richard, but the thing is, it's a funny  outlook on the adult business.  So we get a lot of laughs. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  And we have this great contest with the girls from the audience.  You know, a banana eating contest, spit and swallow contest.  So it's a lot of fun.  What's the spit and swallow contest?  They get all different items in their mouths, and then they either tell the audience to  swallow it or spit it out, and it's very funny.  And my thing is with banana eating.  The girl sucks a banana and gives orgasm noises, discusses her favorite positions.  So it's erotic, and it's enticing without being...  Whatever the law will allow.  Right.  In some cities or in a country, the girls can go nude.  Some just topless.  Some just skimpy with pasties.  Some just flashing bras.  So we go as far as the law. 
[02:32:00]  I don't know what Studio 54 is.  I think probably just skimpy bra and underwear, maybe.  I don't know if they can go topless.  They serve alcohol, you know, those laws.  So you make it as exciting a show as possible, you know, within the law.  Cool.  What do you have to get out of here, unfortunately?  What a lot of fun.  What a question, one more question.  Do you ever get bored of banging?  Like, you ever, like, you're meeting a girl in a club.  That's all I want to do is just dump.  But, I mean, you do it for a living.  And you're like, ugh, who cares?  I'll say, honey, listen, forget it.  I just want to read Shakespeare.  Yeah.  Right.  But is it the same excitement when you have to talk your way into it now? 
[02:32:30]  No.  You still have to.  Look, it's not.  You don't have sex with what people think you do.  You do an active schedule in adult movies, maybe two times, maybe a week, maybe a few  times a month.  It's not like you're doing it every day.  And, like, your average bartender, Chippendale's dancer, movie star, rock star, you know, more  girls in a day than I'll get in a week.  I mean, here's these rock star social lives after a concert.  Ah, their bodyguards are there to get IDs and line them up.  I mean, so those guys got to, they must get bored, you know?  I mean, no, it's still fun.  Just the idea of getting a check for it, though, has got to be really nice.  Or a check, or a Polish, or a Russian. 
[02:33:00]  I mean, they're coming in from all over the world, but I still enjoy it.  All right, we've got to get out of here.  So Ron's going to be at Studio 54 tonight and Saturday.  Doors open at 9.  And they've got to get there at 9.30, because the show, by 11.15, the show's just mostly  just dancing at that time.  So we're going to get there, like, at 9.30 for sure.  And you're going to be at Babe Fest in Philly?  That's going to be, like, next Thursday.  No, I don't think so.  All right, someone said that you would.  That's okay.  So we'll see you at Studio 54 this weekend. 
[02:33:30]  Jim Norton had rascals tonight.  Yeah, more or less to say about that.  It's all right.  And Ron, you've got to come back, man.  Yeah, Ron, that was a lot of fun.  I was with you guys in the very beginning, right?  Yeah.  Was that going to your very first shows?  No, we were here around a half a year at that point.  Because you guys got, I mean, I keep hearing about you guys.  I'm in California, and people can talk about the opening Anthony show.  Yeah, nice.  Obviously, you've grown.  It's, you know, not good.  It's kind of taken off for some reason.  Yeah, Ron, no, a lot of fun, man.  Thanks for coming down. 
[02:34:00]  Thanks, guys.  And all the footage will be up on WNAW.com.  Footage.  Ron in Patty's pants, inchage, footage, whatever it is.  And Patty in Ron's pants.  And check out foundrymusic.com for some stuff on that as well.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  And should we leave the show this week with another track from the new Stone Temple Pilot CD?  Yeah, why not?  We're the first radio show in America that is playing tracks from the new STP CD.  Against the record company's wishes.  Yeah, they're not too happy.  We've played, I don't know, six or seven tracks already today. 
[02:34:30]  We'll leave you with one more from the STP CD.  This is transmissions from a lonely room.  What's a cease and desist or two?  You're hearing it first on the Opie and Anthony show.  And we'll see you guys Monday.  Thank you, Philly.  Monday, Chicago starts.  Yeah, Philly, now you guys are like seasoned vets.  Now we go on to the next whore.  Right.  Hello, CKG in Chicago.  Details on Monday, but here's STP.  Transmissions from a lonely room.  Thanks for calling, and this is the Opie and Anthony F.U. Friday Live. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, I want to give a big F.U. to myself for not quitting my job today when I had the golden opportunity.  Instead, I let them suck me back in, and now I'm stuck.  So, F.U.  Next message.  How about I just send a big F.U. out to my mother-in-law?  I hope that F.U. knows that when she dies and her family leaves, I'm going to stand over her F.U. grave, crack a beer, fire up a cigar, and F.U. all over her F.U. dead body. 
[02:35:30]  Next message.  Hey, here's a big F.U. to the transmission place across the street from me that kept me up all F.U. night with their goddamn alarm going off and their trucks going in and out of there.  F.U. you, D.K.  Next message.  Yeah, how are you?  This F.U. goes to my frickin' stockbroker, who brings me a frickin' stock on one day.  I buy the frickin' stock.  The next frickin' day, it goes down.  F.U.  F.U. 
[02:36:00]  End of message.  Hey, this is Ron Jeremy.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  These guys get more girls in a day than I'll get in a month.  Anthony?  Yes?  Anthony?  Yes, Opie?  Anthony!  Yes?  Anthony!  Yes, Opie?  Anthony!  Uh, yes?  Sam Adams!  Ah, Sam Adams! 
[02:36:30]  Sam Adams! </pre>
