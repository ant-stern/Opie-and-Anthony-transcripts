<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a humorous reading of "A Visit from St. Nicholas," followed by a discussion of a lunar eclipse, interspersed with listener calls sharing their own eclipse viewing experiences and one caller recounting a potentially inappropriate incident involving a man videotaping children during a solar eclipse in the 1970s.  The hosts then shared their negative experiences with bed and breakfasts, focusing on hygiene issues and unsettling encounters.  A brief discussion about New York Governor David Paterson's fine for free Yankees tickets and a silly jingle briefly interrupted the flow.  The conversation shifted to the Broadway show "Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark," specifically a recent stunt accident, leading to a vulgar discussion about male performers' dance belts.  Comedian David Tell joined the studio to promote his upcoming shows at Carolines and a benefit performance.  The hosts also covered Larry King's retirement from CNN, his failed stand-up attempt, reality TV shows (including *Storage Wars*, *Hoarders*, *16 and Pregnant*, *Locked Up Abroad*, *I Survived*, *Man vs. Food*, *Deadliest Catch*, and *Celebrity Rehab*), and conspiracy theories surrounding 9/11.

The show continued with an in-depth discussion of reality TV,  including criticisms of  "I Survived" recaps and the lack of diversity in shows like "Deadliest Catch."  Speculation about life in Alaska, prompted by the popularity of Alaskan-themed shows like "Ice Road Trucker" and "Alaskan Air,"  led to Opie's proposal for a fictional, racially charged urban fishing show concept, "Off the Hook."  Larry King then appeared, delivering a poorly received stand-up routine consisting of two old jokes.  This was followed by a comedian known as "The Virus," whose attempts at stand-up were consistently unsuccessful despite numerous prompts from the hosts and callers, with topics ranging from mosques near Ground Zero to airport security and Larry King's age.  The segment concluded with further promotion for David Tell's shows.

The next segment focused on the website FattyRock.com,  a humorous photo collection.  The hosts then compared and contrasted the Jewish holidays of Hanukkah and Passover with Christmas, using crude humor. This was followed by a discussion of a sexually explicit Christmas song, a video of Jimmy McMillan singing,  and Brett Favre's injured hand. Speculation about McMillan's appearance and political career, and Favre's continued playing despite injury, filled the discussion.  The show ended with a vulgar Kevin Bloody Wilson song about Santa Claus, detailing various Christmas-related complaints and accusations, including allegations of Santa being a pedophile.  David Tell again promoted his upcoming shows, and the hosts read sponsor ads.  Angie Everhart and Fantasia were mentioned as guests, but there was little detailed discussion about their appearances.

The main body of the show tackled three primary topics: Brett Favre's continued NFL career despite his age and injuries, including graphic descriptions and speculation about his penis size; a highly critical and vulgar discussion of "Bridalplasty," focusing on the contestants and procedures; and a lengthy, profane debate about the official 9/11 narrative, featuring a heated exchange with a caller and a firsthand account from a caller who was near the Pentagon during the attack.  The hosts utilized highly offensive language throughout this portion.  A humorous reading of "Twas the Night Before Christmas" was also included.

[00:04:00]  and uh the backup quarterback was told all week it's your game yeah and then brett farve last  minute's like yeah i want to play and the guy's like what the fuck this was my uh time to shine  yeah and then brett farve went in there and got the shit kicked out of him again for everybody  he got it the shit kicked out of him for you and me anthony for you and me for the peeps  for the people the public his people yeah i want to know what kind of human being it takes to  to walk out on that field which jerseys and play football it is amazing that they because it was 
[00:04:30]  what six degrees something like that said and uh the field itself just looked fucking the grass  looked cold sure it was just a frost was over everything yeah it was old school looking like if  you would have if you would have greenied that up a little bit you'd be like when is this when is  this taking place this looks like an old fucking late 60s yeah late 60s early 70s football game but  uh it just looked cold and apparently the bears very used to the cold of course uh the vikings 
[00:05:00]  even they're not so much gear you could you could tell yeah they're like soldiers they figured that  out a long time ago it's like very thin but you know that it's keeping them pretty warm but  they're covered and no exposed skin and the vikings walk out and they're in short sleeves  ah you know they were like where's the dome yeah someone close the roof please someone closed it oh  yeah oh now one of these guys gave us a little shiver like they were cold now just making us all 
[00:05:30]  look like assholes because we wouldn't last five minutes in that atmosphere with short sleeves i  wouldn't even go i would have cried for my mommy i bundled up i last the football game i went to was a  jet game years ago and i i sat in the stands and everybody's jackets were so big that you kind of  just you thunk down and and you're literally stuck in between other people's puffy jackets yeah and  that was the only thing that kind of kept me warm uh but my hands and nose like if you don't have a 
[00:06:00]  scarf and fucking darth vader helmet and fucking 10 pairs of gloves and mittens you're just freezing  and then your feet start getting cold so and that's over you can't warm you probably have frostbite  from that yeah the guys after they play that game last night i imagine they all have frostbite right  i would think why don't they have frostbite yeah it's unbelievable they're men they're athletes yeah  but it's six degrees you're wearing short sleeves that like you said the the field is frozen frozen 
[00:06:30]  all the equipment just feels colder right you know and then you're getting hit by that cold  fucking helmet and and shoulder pads and worse than any of that worse than any injuries you saw  worse than farve hitting his head and everything in that kind of weather just imagine that rock hard  fucking pigskin oh god jamming your cold finger you know when a football jammed your finger back and hit  the tip of your finger wrong fuck that that would make you want to just kill yourself fuck to stop 
[00:07:00]  that pain that that hurts there you go but uh brett farve officially turned me around i'm i'm now a fan  are you team farve yeah but i think this is calculated yeah i think he's just gonna go out  like that uh i don't know like an old gladiator he's just gonna fucking be twitching on the field oh  yeah you know you know he's gonna play in the last game yeah when he wasn't supposed to play last  night and he wasn't supposed to play two weeks ago and it just keeps going on with this who are 
[00:07:30]  the heartless bastards just slamming him down onto the ground like i can understand you know  sacking him and taking him down but they are out for blood right what slamming this guy they should  be uh sacking him like i tackled my my seven month old son is that it you fool around with him a little  bit and you grab him and then you kind of softly put him down but lower him down on the ground like i got  you that's what they should be doing with brett farve yeah no they are gently place him on the  ground they are wonderful i think they want to be known as the guy that officially knocks him out 
[00:08:00]  and his career yeah the career ender but i watched a little bit of that last night everyone remembers  uh lt i'm such a i'm such a faggot though because i'm watching monday night football and i'm also  watching bridalplasty i'm trying to get anthony into bridalplasty so bad so hard and i just can't  fucking do it you gotta just uh dvr one show i know my my pal sam is watching because that's  right down your alley and it gets better as the seasons go as the season continues because they're  all fucked up yeah half the cast is now sitting there and they have bandages on their nose and 
[00:08:30]  their face is all they're all just fucked up like frankenstein dude it is it is the most fucked up  show you watch too um i got to see a marathon on sunday of bridalplasty you tell anthony how sick  this show is and i don't know why i'm for seeing everything on tv but i don't know why there's  not a major outrage about this bridalplasty because you're talking about women that are in  their early 20s getting major fucking plastic surgery to have their perfect wedding and we'll 
[00:09:00]  think so think the real world house where they're not even real world think uh uh give me a reality  show brother sober house sober house i'm well a reality show where you have to do shit yeah big  challenges big brother all right like a big brother house but half the cast is is getting  plastic surgery during the week but it's also like one of the girls is like well i had cancer i had  breast cancer i'm trying to get breast implants because and everybody's like oh okay that may  wait wait the other girls yeah sorry i just want to interrupt you before you give so you would think 
[00:09:30]  you know in some reality shows they let someone slide because they're like you know she really needs to  be here and they worry about knocking them out later but early on in the game you're like you know  she really needs this so we should keep her we'll we'll you know kick this other one out no they got  rid of breast cancer yeah fucking lady that could have catty bitches she could have used the  reconstructive surgery to get her boobs back but they're like fuck you you're out because somebody  else just wanted lipo or a nose job right yeah they have this wish list uh before the show starts 
[00:10:00]  of everything they want done as each challenge goes on they get the pick from their list when they come  back they're like oh you look so great and they're just wheeling you in the front door all bloody and  swollen and bandages and everything like you look so beautiful then they go to the confessional oh she  looked fucking horrible oh god yeah but they wheel her into the recovery room so then she doesn't have  to deal with the show for a week because she's recovering from major fucking major nose job or breast  implant surgery is that like immunity yeah yeah immunity if she's fucking i guess but the way they edit it 
[00:10:30]  it seems like she's only out for two weeks and then after the second week she's back in the  competition again yeah i don't know how long this game is going on because most of these reality shows  they now film within i don't know five weeks or something but they need time for these girls to kind  of recover so they can get back in the game but they're not fully recovered either they're still all  jacked up when they come back in the game all groggy and yeah that's the best part that there's never  been a reality show where the contestants as they go on are all recovering from major surgeries 
[00:11:00]  more and more beat up yeah up and drugged especially if you keep winning you keep getting  more surgery so if you're winning you're really kind of losing yes all right so far i might have  to drop in on this i guess so far no one has won a second surgery i can't wait for that but then  they're in the recovery room just laying there like like beaten soldiers and they're discussing who  should be kicked out of the house as they have ice packs on their on their boobs the other girl has an 
[00:11:30]  ice pack on our on our face remember when people used to get involved with how ethical reality  shows were and and they used to be like big like things with the even the bachelor and shows like  that people would be like you know relationships aren't supposed to be made in front of a television  audience and there would always be some kind of backlash sure i guess they just gave the fuck up  yeah no way because this would have gotten all kinds of shit years ago it's like wait what wait  what are you kidding yeah they're fucking playing a game to make that show for surgeries for major 
[00:12:00]  surgery major just from having dumb challenges yeah and then they they start crying because they're  like they're you know their dreams coming true that they're going to get one of their plastic  surgeries done and then the plastic surgeon is a fucking ghoul he's well known in hollywood  but last night's episode he's like oh look how she just swallows these implants swallows her body  just swallows these implants there was one of the episodes where a girl was getting her nose fixed so  he's drawing with a purple marker all the stuff that he's going to shave and change on her nose 
[00:12:30]  but while he's doing it seems like he's hitting on her at the same time yeah yeah i've seen a lot  of these plastic surgeons on some of these shows and they all always seem a little creepy and like  they're trying to hit on the girl and i i want to i want to feel better about herself i want to do some  of this uh plastic surgery stuff because he he walks into the recovery room he gave this blonde  really nice boobs he goes all right let me see she pulls her shirt off without even hesitating and  he's undoing her bra like it's not yeah let me take a look oh that's symmetrical and then he like  touches the bottom yeah i gotta make sure there's a little lift i gotta make sure the weight is right 
[00:13:00]  on on on these this is three brides at your table you are safe from being sent home dominique with  three guests at your table you are still in the running to become the perfect bride  it's making a wonder is this how you guys are going to vote every time that is how they're  going to vote they have for them to click together janessa lisa marie melissa and dominique  oh we're watching the clip where they're discussing who to kick off and which great as as they're in  bed recovering from their surgery yeah job chick yeah they're having these meetings while they're 
[00:13:30]  bedridden and can't get up because they just went through major surgery it is a weird fucking show and  no one is talking about how this might be wrong yeah yeah the ethical argument just went out the  window they were they were mad at like uh who wants to marry a millionaire yeah like that they  were they were all but the money aspect they just said the winner gets to be the perfect bride  implying that the perfect bride is going to need a lot of plastic surgery you can't just be the  perfect bride you you need to what are the little girls thinking when they watch this right oh yeah 
[00:14:00]  i mean now time for your next bridal plasty challenge kristen you will not be competing in  this challenge because you are still on medical leave the other crucial part of your wedding will be  the reception you want the dinner to be memorable and tasteful and that's what this challenge is all  about we will be playing five rounds for each course she's on medical leave for her big uh you know  boob job yeah but the challenge is just tasting food which doesn't make sense well you know she 
[00:14:30]  might be on some kind of diet right and this is the one i was telling anthony about where they they  have to taste all sorts of shit you would get at a wedding like a champagne for example yeah and they  have a five hundred dollar bottle of champagne and a four dollars bottle of champagne in front of  them they got you know a little taste of each and they have to figure out which is the more expensive  one oh and these dumb broads couldn't figure any of this shit out they were getting half of it  wrong they don't know shit and then she's in champagne they just want some surgeries they just want 
[00:15:00]  to get their fucking tits pumped up and their nose cut down and their lips bigger and their eyes pulled  back and uh and you know when you kick someone off a reality show there's got to be some kind of  catchphrase yeah theirs is your wedding will go on it it just won't be perfect because it'll just be  you looking like that ugly you it'll be you without your surgeries when the husband lifts  the veil he's gonna see that horrid face yeah and those little scrawny tits can you get can you get 
[00:15:30]  the catchphrase because it's hilarious right she delivers it's very seriously like your wedding will  still go on it just won't be perfect it just won't be perfect because but every woman is getting cut  up but every woman wants to think they're having the perfect wedding well in the back of her mind  she's gonna know this ain't perfect right right before the actual ending the best part is when  they have to uh there'll be certain people that are up on the block say right and the ones who have  to vote for those people to be eliminated yeah they come up there and they all start crying and they 
[00:16:00]  said you're like a sister to me i admire your spirituality you always listen you're there to  soothe my woes and like just really awful language and then it cuts back to the confessional  and they're all just shit talking each other just bashing each other it's all lies well it's  fucking hens it's like every other reality show yeah yeah well they're sort of reinventing the reality  show by having all these major surgeries drama this show should be the biggest show on tv  because it's so fucked up yeah well it seems like it i'm gonna have to maybe you gotta at least 
[00:16:30]  take a little a little uh look again you got something else on the same no no no i don't think  they're uh they don't post the episodes online that's too bad yeah i'm about like the 16 and  pregnant and fucking hoarders still and you're watching the new 16 and pregnant season who isn't  yeah i'm with you i gotta i gotta watch that shit yeah that's a must see as well the white trash  that is going on you remember the fat one from the first season yes beating up her boyfriend yeah

[00:32:30]  disgusting women you're disgusted by it i'm disgusted by them and how they try to it's because it's  almost the sex in the city vibe you get with them when they're not clawing at each other this this is  sometimes show them in slow motion and you just say uh what is that look at her fucking look at her  fucking clavicle it's it's sticking out of her skin she looks like a fucking a leather sack full of 
[00:33:00]  antlers thank you that's what she fucking looks like that gives away a woman's age oh the clavicle  clavicle starts sticking out clavicle is disgusting younger broad no you don't see the clavicle there's  enough to be in in good shape there's enough body fat and not fat but like body fat under the skin that  pads the bone structure right so you don't see what amounts to a skeleton with skin on it there you go  and the worst part is they have kids which if they have to take care of them they're completely 
[00:33:30]  fucking annoyed right if they're nannies oh my nanny's kid is sick like oh what the fuck now i gotta  take care of my kids right yeah you never see the kids because they don't have the rib they don't  have just one nanny they got two or three nannies then they got a house uh how what do they call it a  house uh uh whatever they they got so much what is it a house yeah and let me tell you something  about these other uh broads when they start fucking getting like this and it's it's the from the 
[00:34:00]  tanning and the plastic surgery and everything else that they're doing to themselves uh that  fucking leather breastplate that that used to i guess be cleavage and now it's just turned into this  fucking rock hard looking and they insist on wearing the low cut shit well they have you just see this  the the the fucking the clavicle the breastbone you see the sternum and the clavicle and and it's  covered with a thin layer of tanned hide and then the breast starts somewhere down a little lower than 
[00:34:30]  than normal yeah major league baseball could carve something out and and make uh like catcher's  mitts make some mitts they have catcher's mitt chest sure thank you robin yeah all right uh you find  the the cancer one no that's her getting her nails done with her mom yeah whatever this is just a  picture just a picture yeah i've got recaps of it no video what does the recap say about the uh 
[00:35:00]  uh just describing what happened and i love when they fucking wave to each other with their  short sleeve kind of things or their dresses and you just see i don't know what world to hurt it  looks like it looks like hubba bubba chewing gum hanging from their fucking arms what do they  call that bat wings or something or bat wing arms it's called old broad fucking tricep and and it's  just it's they haven't figured out a plastic surgery for that one yet and i i hate to use the effect 
[00:35:30]  again but maybe you should just go to the station the gas station  that fucking thing is deflating get a tire pressure gauge on your fucking elbow right on man  it's just horrible so there you go i don't know there's your reality show wrap-up here's what it is  with these bitches too they don't want to work at looking good like working out you could look good  and get toned up and shit like that but they just want to lay down on a fucking table and get cut and 
[00:36:00]  sucked and fucking everything else and uh think that that's all they need to do shortcuts no shortcuts  don't work yeah all right god that fucking kelsey grammars chick her eye sockets you saw that are  frightening look at what is that well that's crazy eyes too and she's got the crazy eyes i think she's  done a little something something from time to time oh yeah because i mean you should never see 
[00:36:30]  all the whites of someone's eyes like that yeah yeah and all their foreheads look like one baby  butt cheek there isn't a ripple or a wrinkle in it it's like fucking it you ever see a beluga whale  they have that sonar equipment in their forehead that's what their foreheads look like from all that  shit injected in it nice and their own ass fat yeah i didn't know you were watching this show i've seen  enough episodes i've seen probably three or four maybe there was a marathon run on one night i was  like that do you like it better than conspiracy theory conspiracy theory is great i watched the 
[00:37:00]  one on uh just last night i watched the one on um the pentagon what's going on it was a missile  what i spoke with an expert and it's just some guy it's his experts are people i've never heard of  they're old wrestlers one guy let me tell you something governor the god the government knew  about this you're saying the government knew and he's just some guy one of his experts is just 
[00:37:30]  incredible just incredible and then now they've added in where did the missile come from  troy might know an airplane oh troy no i don't want to you know what happened a couple days before  christmas i don't want to deal with heavy shit that american airlines flight right flew just over  the pentagon by the way the missile hit and blew up and blocked the view of the american airlines  plane flying past and over the pentagon no one saw it because the big fireball then where the fuck is 
[00:38:00]  the plane what where's the plane who jesse didn't explain that and then it's like and no one was able  to find one piece of airplane debris and then i i was like all right go on google now google pentagon  9 11 aircraft debris and there is debris everywhere with american airlines markings on it and it's not  like one piece here it's scattered everywhere there's landing gear there's fucking engine turbine parts 
[00:38:30]  did fucking everything and the plane not hitting 90 degree on a 90 degree angle to the wall didn't  make a shape of an airplane like it did at the trade center it hit at a very sharp angle to the wall  so you can't say well where's where's the outline of an airplane much like wily coyote thank you i was  gonna say like a cartoon yeah he's looking for a cartoon uh situation it wasn't a missile it's a 
[00:39:00]  fucking plane full of people that died that's right so why won't they release the video because  you know what they released one video that shows a plume of smoke coming out of an engine and a tail  behind a piece of uh uh blocking and the rest of the video how about this i'll give you one thing  that might be might be a credible answer do you think perhaps the pentagon doesn't want everyone  knowing where their every surveillance camera is possibly but i don't understand why you would 
[00:39:30]  well i'm just saying why i i own my house i have surveillance cameras i don't even go on and tell  people where my cameras are but why wouldn't you just shut everybody up by showing a one frame of  the plane okay they showed that angle so they exposed where that security camera is so just show the  plane going in they did to me i saw it where do you think any other camera might not it's missing a  bunch of frames you think it might not when a plane's doing you know in excess of 500 uh miles an hour  i think the 30 frames per second of video really doesn't capture it coming into frame and then 
[00:40:00]  hitting the building so if that seems to be the problem i guess it's less than a fucking  millisecond where's the plane then troy where's the i mean look where's the plane why wouldn't they  where's the plane what where's the they hit the building yeah yeah i don't know no where's the  plane that left that left the fucking i don't know i can't answer that i have no idea but i'm just  saying is that a fake plane if they're flight if they're go just tell me where the plane is  where are people that were in the plane yeah where are the people that were in the plane  i don't know they're all still not i just don't know why island from lost 
[00:40:30]  uh oceanic 815 maybe it was a fake plane that took off you know if there's this many questions  why wouldn't you just answer this many questions well if somebody's questioning look i don't believe  a plane hit this building a plane hit the pentagon so why wouldn't they just show the frame of the  plane going into the building and go there you go shut the fuck up there's a nice photoshop for  everybody he said that no that's what we'd get okay they could show video of the plane  flying right in the pentagon and you'd get ah that seems to be a little photoshop d boy 
[00:41:00]  one of my experts d boy is here making a rare appearance on the show and later in the program  the governor storms the pentagon they said that they said that and by storming they show him getting a  security pass clipping it on his pocket and walking through with pixelated head man i'm walking with  pixelated head guy how did this happen was it a tragic experiment from area 51 let me go to mike 
[00:41:30]  at dc mikey who was mike who was at the pentagon the pentagon that day troy go ahead mike  hey troy you're a fucking retard why because i have questions that's why i'm a fucking retard well  that's what happens when you don't believe government i don't believe everything that  has told me going this is the truth you have to believe this that's why i'm a fucking retard he's  not going to be spoon fed mikey what do you got on this they told you you couldn't breathe water  either now go in and give it a try mikey go ahead what what do you got there were there were so many 
[00:42:00]  witnesses that saw the plane that no none of these conspiracy theorists ever listened to i was  working less than a quarter of a mile away on top of a building when the plane hit i almost got hit by  the plane you mean the missile so you do you want to take this guy's word for it troy i don't know i  don't know who this jerk off is and why isn't there witnesses that said i mean just because a missile  hit the pentagon where are those guys there were people that said i didn't see a plane go in there  but did they say i saw a missile they didn't see anything i didn't see a plane said she she last night 
[00:42:30]  i watched this show and she says i didn't see a plane um what i heard sounded more like a bomb  she's inside the fucking building first of all so you're saying you didn't see a plane  and it sounded like a bomb she's in the building she couldn't see it it hit and exploded okay  so just just show one fucking frame of the airplane going into the building just to shut 
[00:43:00]  everybody the fuck up no reason to why why placate dummy motherfuckers like why should the pentagon  and the military say all right let me put this out just to prove it to these idiots that won't  believe shit anyway i don't know i i like i said to you before i have a hard time ten years here's  what jesse would say and ten years later they release a clip of the plane going in well that's  enough time to doctor up something that's what they say now why release it just to make people 
[00:43:30]  more fucked up i got a theory as far as the video footage goes d-boy's got it it's a it's a camera  that's shooting all day long you're not going to shoot 30 frames per second right you're going to  shoot like it's just like when you see like somebody robbing a bank that's true i'm going like this  and then this it's never 30 frames never 30 frames per second so is something traveling that fast  it's obvious the camera's going to miss it if it's not shooting at 30 frames per second if you look at 
[00:44:00]  that yeah if you see see that now to the right that little um square post there in front right behind  that you see the tail of a plane sticking up it's that pointy thing and the plume of smoke is where the  engine was already damaged from hitting light poles so you see a plume of smoke and the tail  of the jet it's behind that square post to the right do you see it yeah i see what that is i mean  i can't make that as a plane part it's very hard to make out as a plane but it's the fucking plane 
[00:44:30]  okay well that's fine and you're allowed to believe what you think you see there and by the way a cruise  missile or a missile would not skate on the ground like that the only thing that could do that is by the  way and they were saying the pilot much to inexperienced it's an inexperience that almost  had him crash into the ground well in front of the pentagon okay he got so fucking lucky hitting  that thing a missile would have come in why wouldn't a missile come in high and hit the top of the 
[00:45:00]  fucking thing why skate the ground hit light poles you can generator you can control missiles to do  whatever you want not like that my friend yes you can you can have them no maybe in cartoons you can't  you can launch them from the middle of the ocean to go hit thousands and thousands of miles away to  your your exact destination missiles cannot fly a cruise missile can fly other missiles are uh gravity  based missiles that use uh fins to steer on their way down they're not powered they're not powered 
[00:45:30]  cruise missiles are powered that's not a cruise missile and even a powered cruise missile is isn't an  exocet going fucking two feet off an ocean and hitting light poles okay it might damage the missile but  let me know you know it did it wings large wings the same dimension of a 757 macho man randy savage  thinks it was a missile ah oh yeah but i agree with you governor i don't understand why i'm an asshole for 
[00:46:00]  questioning what has been given to me as the truth you're questioning shit that is so logical  and so spelt out so so you look silly it's like questioning the fact that we are on the 36th floor  would you question that every day you come in and press the elevator button just because the elevator  says counting you have you ever counted every floor have you gone outside try to find your window  and gone that's 37 you're trusting that the elevator every day is letting you off on that 
[00:46:30]  floor all i'm saying man is is if you are trusting everything that is being tell told to you as the  truth i don't but i trust that's some scary shit dude that's like that's like some getting the  fucking cattle car shit you know what i mean like no there's enough facts to back this up okay so no  one's telling me that a plane hit this with absolutely no proof i'm being told a plane hit the pentagon  with irrefutable proof okay so there you don't want so your argument is you don't people don't 
[00:47:00]  want to know or the government doesn't want you to know where the security cameras are in the pentagon  okay now how many security cameras are around in the other buildings so why can't they show the  airplane coming and go there's the fucking airplane maybe they didn't get it you know are you kidding  me okay i don't tell me that they didn't confiscate every single security tape okay so why can't they  just go from that building that's not the pentagon could be a reason i don't know but let me tell you  another thing a lot of crimes are prosecuted and um they rarely have video of the person killing 
[00:47:30]  somebody or robbing a house they take what's called evidence and they weigh it and then they  come to a conclusion with nary a piece of video uh it's very rare as a matter of fact that video  is showing a crime being committed yet people are convicted all the time based on evidence there is  enough evidence at that scene of that crime to tell me that an airplane hit that fucking building  yeah well i guess how do you explain american airlines body parts um from the fuselage parts 
[00:48:00]  uh a turbine engine um a landing gear wheel which is exactly matched up to a 757 all debris spread out  over a very large portion of of this uh crash site how do you explain that okay i you know i'm just  saying if there's a question of the plane do more research i haven't i haven't done the research of  exactly what was found at the debris site how about you just google uh google this pentagon pentagon 
[00:48:30]  nine eleven aircraft debris let's see on your own time no no on your own time hold on hold on  after the holidays you come back with some research okay and you will be uh converted uh through evidence  you there isn't a what they call magic bullet videotape of this it's not necessary right  it really isn't and i think it only gets people more excited about oh look at this new cover-up  it's fucking you know i i see uh uh what they're doing uh movies these days it's amazing what they 
[00:49:00]  could do with cgi so you think that everything that is told to us is the truth no i never said that  i mean i believe this is hold on hold on we got eyewitnesses we got a i got a whole phone bank  of eyewitnesses i'm going to dc to find this person megan go ahead are you sure you want to talk  you might be murdered what megan half of dc saw that plane fly over my brother was sitting in front 
[00:49:30]  of the white house and saw the plane and the day after i rode my bike up there you couldn't drive your  car but you could ride a bike or walk really close and i took tons of pictures of one part sticking out  of the building sure you did good luck sleep and get a gun they're gonna come for you this chick is  obviously a government plan just like they're coming for me for exposing troy comment another  eyewitness another eyewitness all the people there somebody somebody had to have shoot shot video of  the plane going in there has to be video somewhere how about this my friend troy my friend listen 
[00:50:00]  there wasn't a lot of video cameras around 2001 2001 is a lot different than today and new york city  new york city there are exactly two videos of the first plane hitting the trade center only two and  not security you know how many fucking they weren't security cameras do you know how many fucking cameras  are around in new york city only two one was a video crew that just happened to hear this fucking 
[00:50:30]  screaming plane and the other one was uh recently some guy in in uh uh jersey i think right it was  jersey had a video way in the background you see something happen to the trade center so really  you're only getting one clear shot of a plane hitting that building if a second plane didn't hit  and that was all they had or they didn't have that one video there would absolutely be people saying  that it was a missile that hit the trade center too right because there's no uh evidence um but you  know we saw one one video of the first plane hitting well does a truck believe that two planes hit the 
[00:51:00]  world trade center yeah absolutely okay so then why would a missile hit the pentagon on the same day  you look all i know is believe in the lochness monster oh okay now that i do i've seen them  i don't know he's big he believes in the he's a big one i don't know what's wrong at wrestlemania  back in 82 i just don't know what's wrong with with asking questions that's all you got the answers  and then you keep okay so that's my answer right there there it is two is four don't keep 
[00:51:30]  questioning all i'm saying man is if you start believing if you start believing everything you  are told i don't what you're you're told on that tv we don't well i'm just saying and you're not  and you're not questioning no no you're taking one example you're making me think i'm making  i'll tell you i'll tell you the same thing why don't you believe anything anyone tells you i don't but  i question i ask questions and there's nothing wrong with asking questions and i've i've researched  and there's nothing wrong with going you know what you're a fucking idiot because you don't believe 
[00:52:00]  that it's like well sorry it doesn't look like there's a plane fly in there to me that's what  was released they released one video there was a bazillion cameras that shot that why is that the  only one that they released what is wrong with asking that there's nothing wrong but aside from  all the other mountains of evidence that prove it's a plane you're just taking that one thing the video  or lack thereof and basing your entire doubt and questioning on that instead of doing the  research to see that it was indeed a fucking plane and then just going oh well i could throw out the 
[00:52:30]  video aspect of it and look at all the other evidence and realize it was a plane but instead  you're throwing out all the evidence and just considering the one piece of video but there's just  it's just it's odd that's all i'm saying it's either they release one video and you don't see the  plane i'll give you that it's odd i'll give you that okay but it does not make it not a plane and  when p like i said when people stop asking questions okay now he's he's got his confident  pose because you gave him a little you gave him a little question authority Troy's a bigfoot hunter 
[00:53:00]  whatever no look all i'm saying all i'm saying and then this is over i've seen him i've seen him  he's moving all i'm saying is when people stop asking questions you got your cookies made that's  where some serious shit's gonna fucking people stop asking questions you won't believe what you don't  know say what's up to the tooth fairy merry christmas happy new year i went to one of my experts 
[00:53:30]  troy kwan you could be on that show troy you could just open a door mysteriously hello governor  in the dark i don't want people to see me they he doesn't want it he's scared are you frightened  that they might be hunting you in all uh in all fairness there's people that have questions too  troy they're on the line of course there are it's uh you know you're always going to get people that  won't believe it based on one or two items whereas there's a lot of evidence that prove it's uh  it was what it was but but a lot of these conspiracy people they never consider it 
[00:54:00]  they don't listen to it or they just blow it up you go what about the american airlines fuselage  parts that are being seen being picked up by many people and they'll be like uh you know what the  videotape wasn't it's like wait wait i just asked you something well the government doesn't have a  squeaky clean image of of telling us the truth all the time so there's nothing wrong with with going  oh well you lied about all this shit why wouldn't you lie about this oh you're telling the truth about  this so i'd rather believe that uh muslim fucking extremists um caught us with our pants down and 
[00:54:30]  uh killed a lot of people that day okay then think that our government fucked us on this one  uh especially considering that wow the the whole conspiracy is still going on the muslims are still  fucking uh the the bad guy you know no they are the bad guys your mic's on rollin sir for you  is santa claus merry christmas roy  rollin  there's a call to you santa claus 
[00:55:00]  oh  shit rollin shakes his ass and leaves  rollin knows how to hit and run he's the king of hitting  That's embarrassing.  All right.  Ouch.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Look, Troy, I will give you this.  I do respect your inquisitiveness of this whole thing, but I think you should look a little  further into the other evidence and then make a decision, not just based on video. 
[00:55:30]  You come back with some actual evidence after the break.  But you understand, though, when you start believing everything you're told, that's some  serious problem.  That's like, that's getting the fucking cattle car with the rest of the sheep.  You don't listen to the show.  No, we don't believe in everything that is told to us.  But I'm not saying just because I believe this means I believe everything.  I've never said that.  And I'm not saying just because you don't believe this means you don't believe everything either.  Right.  It's a, you take it by a case-by-case basis and you weigh the evidence, you do your research  and then you make a decision.  And that's everything in life.  Right.  That's not just this or anything. 
[00:56:00]  So, um, get the fuck out of here.  Merry Christmas, gentlemen.  Merry Christmas, Troy.  Have you been a good boy?  Ho, ho, ho.  I'm just mad at Troy because he has so much fucking hair.  There he goes.  Troy to the X-Files music.  That should be his music for now on.  That is now Troy's music.  Yes.  He wants to believe.  He's got posters up in his room.  Definitely.  He definitely thinks there's aliens.  Yeah.  As well.  Of course. 
[00:56:30]  Why is he walking around bragging about having so much fucking hair?  I don't think he said anything about hair.  It's just how he presents it.  It's a visual braggard.  It's just how he presents it.  Yeah.  You couldn't fit another strand of hair in his fucking head.  No.  And then he fucking gels it with fucking...  Good luck.  It suits him.  Yeah.  I don't know if he actually uses jism, though.  I think he uses jism.  Oh, he's nodding his head.  Yes, he does.  Okay.  Oh, he does?  Okay.  Can we take our first ring?

The Opie and Anthony Show proudly presents A Visit from St. Nicholas, narrated by Big A  and Stalker Patty.  Twas?  Twas?  Twas? 
[00:58:00]  The Night  The Night  Before Christmas  When all  through the house  not a creature  was  not even 
[00:58:30]  a mouse  the  hawkings  were hung  by the chimney  with a care  in hopes  that St. Nicholas  soon  will be here  I mean will be there 
[00:59:00]  the children  were nestled  all snug in their beds  while visions  of sugar plums  danced in their heads  and mama  in her  kerchief  and I  in my cap  had to settle  our brains  for a long  winter's nap  when I  went out  on the  floor  there was  such a clatter  I  I  I  I  sprang  from the bed  to see 
[00:59:30]  what was  the matter  I  wait to the window  I  flew like a flash  tore open  the shutters  and  threw up  the sash  the moon  on the breast  of the new  falling snow  gave luster  of midday  to objects  below  when  what to my  wondering eyes  should appear  but a miniature  sleigh  and eight 
[01:00:00]  tiny reindeer  with a little  old driver  so lively  and quick  I knew  in a moment  it must be  the same  of Nick  more rapid  than eagles  his  his  his  coursers  they came  and he  whistled  and shouted  and called  them  by name  now dasher  now dancer  now prancer  and victim  on comet 
[01:00:30]  on cupid  on Donner  and Blitzen  to the top  of the porch  to the top  of the wall  now dash away  dash away  dash away  all  as  as dry  as dry  leaves  before  the wild  hurricanes  fly  when they  meet  with an  obstacle  around  to the  sky  so up 
[01:01:00]  to the  housetop  the  horses  they  flew  with a  sleigh full  of toys  and seeing  Nicholas too  and then  in a  twinkling  I  heard  on the  rope  the  prancing  and pawing  of each  little  hoop  as I  drew  on my  head  and was  turning  around  down  the  chimney  St.  Nicholas  came  with a  bound  he was  dressed in 
[01:01:30]  all  he was  dressed  all in  fur  from his  head  to his  foot  and his  clothes  all  tarnished  with  ashes  and  soot  a bundle  of toys  he had  flung on  his back  and he  looked like  a peddler  just opening  his pack  his eyes  how they 
[01:02:00]  twinkled  his dimples  how merry  his cheeks  were like  roses  his nose  like a  cherry  his droll  little mouth  was drawn  up like a  bow  and the  beard of  his chin  was as  white as  the snow  of  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the 
[01:02:30]  the  the  the  the  the  the  he held  tight in  his teeth  and the  smoke  in  circled  his head  like a  wreath  he had  a broad  face  and a  little  round  belly  when he  laughed  like a  bowl  full  of jelly  he was  chubby  and plump  a right  jolly  old elf  and I  laughed  when I  saw him  in spite  of myself  a wink  of his  eye  and a  twist 
[01:03:00]  of his  head  soon  gave me  to know  I had  nothing  to dread  he  spoke  not a  word  but went  but went  but went  but went  but went  straight  to his  work  and filled  all his 
[01:03:30]  and filled  all  and filled  all  the  stockings  and turned  a jerk  and laying  his finger  aside of his  nose  and giving a  nod up the  chimney he rose  he sprang to  a sleigh  till his team  gave a whistle  and the way 
[01:04:00]  they all flew  like the  down of a  thistle  but I  heard him  explain  ere he  drove out  of sight  happy  christmas  to all  and to all  a good  night  this concludes  the opian  anthony show's  version of  a visit  from saint  nicholas  if you  lasted all  the way  through it  congratulations  god 
[01:04:30]  big a  could be  animated  i'm telling  you  yeah  but not  as  big a  like  you know  what i mean  you just  give him  like a  whole  different  completely  different  look  in  animation  yeah  i could  see him  in an  animated  feature  a big  a  opian  anthony  we got  davittell  coming in  today  a couple  days before  we take  a break  very good  very good  pretty much  the only ones  working live  here at  sirius xm  actually i see  a few other  dummies walking 
[01:05:00]  around the  hall  really  just a few  all the  insecure people  are here  traffic very  light  extremely  light  able to do  very smooth  like  you know when  you're going  down a mountain  skiing and  you're just  doing smooth  back and forth  some nice  soft turns  that's how i get  through traffic  i just  whoa  i don't have  to like  two inches  from the  guy in  front of  me  and now  cut in  on the  side  you're  that guy  i don't have  to do that  love that  nice and  smooth  uh  oh  lunar eclipse 
[01:05:30]  yes there was a  lunar eclipse  last night  and in the  middle of the  night i had a  uh a  boner  oh really  i had a  piss  boner  so i got up  and i said  you know what  while i take  care of this  i'm gonna take  a peek out  the window  what was i  looking for  the moon  with a reddish  hue to it  i didn't even  see the moon  oh yeah  what side is the  moon on right  now  um it was  about two  two in the  morning  all right two  in the morning  um where was  it though  or in the sky  wait is it  supposed to be  two in the  morning  it was last 
[01:06:00]  night right  yeah it was  last night  yeah i saw  nothing and  people are  tweeting me  pictures of uh  their shots of  the lunar eclipse  and all it is  is a white  circle in the  middle of a lot  of darkness  yeah like it  didn't look any  different to me  no it looks  very red  it's very red  it's the the  the earth passes  between the sun  and the moon  correct and  casts a shadow  on the moon  yeah and uh it  gives it this  reddish look  hue hue to it 
[01:06:30]  uh that's about  it not as exciting  as a solar eclipse  did you see it  uh no i didn't  i was crapped out  you do realize  i give a shit  yeah but do you  realize this is the  first time in  six hundred and  i want to say  forty four years  well that it's  taken place on  the summer uh  winter solstice  oh is that it  yeah that's the  only thing  oh this happens  a lot  yeah oh  then why the  hell am i  getting up in  the middle  of the night  yeah it  doesn't matter  i could have  strapped that  boner down and  kept sleeping  fuck it  i want a good  solar eclipse  there hasn't  been one for  north america 
[01:07:00]  or at least  the north um  east in a long  time i remember  as a kid you  know it was  kind of cool  don't look up  see like uh  yeah they tell  you don't even  go out i remember  some fucking dumb  mother of one  of my friends  saying and she  kept her kids in  the house during  an eclipse yeah  like it's dangerous  to even be outside  why it's like you  primitive motherfucker  she's like one of  those people that  just would have like  killed herself and  her family back in  like the 1400s when  they didn't know  what it was all  about they're just  like ah throw  yourself off the  building but uh 
[01:07:30]  no i like all that  shit i was always  into astronomy and  telescopes when i  was a kid uh  solar eclipses were  always cool i used  to make the little  thing where you take  a hole punch  and you punch it  into a uh a piece  of paper right  and then you stand  with your back to  the sun right and  you you take a uh  like a file card or  something like that  and you hold the the  paper with a hole in  it a certain distance  away from the file  card and you see a  circle and then you  see like a little  like crescent start  moving in how  about you turn  around and look  up because it'll 
[01:08:00]  burn your eyes  out but you said  that doesn't happen  no you look at the  sun it'll burn your  eyes out you could be  outside but you know  you know it's not  gonna burn your eyes  out it's better to  just how does it  burn your eyes out  uh because you're  looking at the sun  so it's the sun  so you're looking  so it's not like it  only happens when the  eclipse is happening  yeah it's pretty much  just looking at the  sun fucks you up  see i always thought  there was some  magical powers because  there was an eclipse  that's how they told it  to us  no it's just so you  should just never look  at the sun  right why did they 
[01:08:30]  say that yeah they  said don't look at you  know why because most  people it's pretty  boring to look at the  sun but then when an  eclipse starts happening  you're like what the  fuck is that you look  up at it and you stare  and then by the time  you you look away your  retinas are fucking  burnt out and it's  like and you're all  done it's like an  image burned on the  tv yeah yeah it  happens very fast with  your peepers too  uh last solar eclipse  come on give it to  me was 11 i'm going  644 years ago come 
[01:09:00]  on uh oh no it was  7 11 7 11 10 now  that wasn't for the  northeast what 10 14  10 where no he's  talking it was this  year it was probably  somewhere in europe no  i want to know when in  that it was visible to  us me i heard 644  years but uh those are  the cool ones and yeah  and if you have a  telescope with one of  those uh sun filter i  used to have one of  those like a telescope 
[01:09:30]  and you'd screw in this  thing it was like thicker  than a fucking welding  really mask and you'd  screw it into your lens  and then put the lens  into the telescope and  look and you could just  look at the sun through  your telescope and see  like sunspots and shit  oh that's kind of cool  and you look at the  eclipse through that  that was uh paul in new  york hey there paul  hey what's going on guys  what do you say mike  hey actually i lost the  last solar eclipse was uh  1919 i think because i  just watched the damn  thing on einstein he  proved uh relatively 
[01:10:00]  relativity by that no i  saw i've seen solar  eclipses when i was a  kid yeah we definitely  saw them as a kid  but uh i have yeah i'm  not that old we're old  but we're not that old  yeah no i just watched  the thing on einstein but  i saw that lunar uh  close last night it was  pretty freaking wild i'm  like you guys i like i  get into that kind of  shit yeah i like that  what did you see paul  it was what it looked  like it looked like  mars almost it looked  reddish yeah i don't  know what mars looks  like it's red yeah it  does turn very red very  reddish you know you 
[01:10:30]  see the pictures on the  internet look exactly  like that it was i'll  freeze my ass off i got  my 11 year old kid get  up he walked out for  about 10 seconds yeah  yeah i'm going back to  bed yeah he wanted to go  play xbox the fucking  youth that's gonna happen  for a long time again i  think it's a bunch of  years again what for a  for a lunar yeah but  you could just look  online when we were  growing up when they  said this isn't going to  happen for a long time  you were kind of bummed  because there was nowhere  to go to see it yeah now  we could go online and  see it again later today 
[01:11:00]  yeah yeah i saw it on the  news this morning right  so it's always there now  it will always be there  right available to look  at i mean if you missed  uh an eclipse when you  were growing up that was  it unless you bought like  an encyclopedia or  something yeah maybe they  had pictures of it in  there a still picture  that's what you had to  do maybe in a magazine  if you're lucky to come  across a magazine with  it life magazine has a  picture of the eclipse in  it so then it mattered  back then when they said  it would be a long time  before you see this again  now there's 8 000 videos 
[01:11:30]  of it on youtube let's  make believe it's  happening tonight and  check out some videos  later on tonight  at our leisure by the  way you don't have to  wake up in the middle  of the night that's the  next solar eclipse for us  for us is myself saying  that was pretty freaking  wild looking i mean you  look at it like that is  pretty wild and it was  it was yeah you're like  this is like a huge  mass space i i did take  a look and i maybe it  was cloudy in new york i  don't know because i  didn't see nothing you  know at the very tail  end of it started  clouding over but i had  a section that was wide  open what what time  were you up 2 45 what 
[01:12:00]  what part of new york  uh newberg new york  upstate i was looking the  wrong way then because i  was up around uh i want  to say three what was it  what was it on the clock  like 3 15 yeah so that  was right in the middle  of this you're looking  west right yeah it was  already moving back  the other way yeah  2 45 exactly is when i  went back and i looked  out a few windows though  i just couldn't see no  red in the sky i said  ah fuck it's probably  cloudy we're not getting  another solar eclipse until  fucking 2017 the world 
[01:12:30]  ends in 2012 we're fucked  yeah we're not gonna see  that one and the last  solar eclipse for the u.s  was in 91 7 11 free  slurpee day too wow you  guys have a good day thank  you thank you sir all  right so he stayed up and  saw it and his 11 year  old could care less yeah  that's what happens second  or third grade was when he  saw the last solar eclipse  uh joe in new york what's  up fellas hey um yeah i  remember i was in uh in  elementary school we were  on like some school trip or

[01:13:30]  molester kind of guy had a  video camera back uh back  then yeah well of course it  was in central islip this  had to be there was it there  was it was an eclipse  somewhere around 1970  around there i will say  there was a pretty damn good  eclipse uh back then and uh  uh there was this guy and i'm  out there with my like stupid  piece of paper trying to see  it and there was some guy that  had a video camera back in  like 1970 wow it was this big  fucking contraption and  everything and he used to 
[01:14:00]  take videos of all the kids  playing uh outside yeah but  he came out with that and a  little monitor did they ever  catch the guy for being a  pedo no back then it was  just fucking good sport it  was just it was just part of  growing up part of growing up  you're exactly right pedophile  wants to videotape you yeah  uh and uh yeah he uh he had  the the monitor out there and  he had it pointed at the sun and  they had a little filter over  the front and then all the  little kids were gathered  around uh watching the the  eclipse and uh eclipse was bait 
[01:14:30]  for this guy it was bait it  was fucking bait and he's  just snapping other pictures  because he had like nice  cameras and everything so he's  taking pictures all the little  kids i think we ought to pay  with our our clothes to see it  creep i hope he got fucking  drafted went to the nom  yeah but a lot of those guys  came back okay yeah well not  him you want him to be one of  the unlucky ones over there yeah  he didn't touch me though i was  not that touchable you know of  i don't sit around and try to

[01:19:00]  say hi to andrew in jersey andrew  andrew  hey boys uh i was leaving for work  this morning about three so i did see  the the lunar eclipse but the funny  part is my neighbor was standing in  his driveway and he scared the shit  out of me oh really yeah he's like  hey how you doing i'm like what the  fuck are you doing here three o'clock  in the morning you don't want to hear  anything at that hour god that's gonna  get fucking shot  actually i went on the highway and uh  you know there was no uh light  pollution as you say anthony and uh 
[01:19:30]  it was pretty good once i got once i  got on the highway it was pretty good  well what'd you see it was basically  like everybody said it was red kind of  looked like it was almost cloudy you  know like clouds were over it it was  just very red so it sort of looked like  the moon it's a red moon  that's what it looks like a little red  thrown in the moon looking red a lot  of people set their alarm clocks to  see nothing that's what it looks like  well yeah that's if you have a really  that's if you're nasa or national  geographic national geographic nat geo i'm 
[01:20:00]  sure got some great pictures of it  yeah all right thank you sir enough  about the lunar eclipse about the eclipse  sounds like it was a bust for most  people a big time bust i think people  liked it huh i think people kind of  liked it if you're into that kind of  thing  sanjay gupta sanjay gupta the sanjay gupta  correspondent for cnn correct the  mundo he uh had a fine segue yeah he 
[01:20:30]  didn't think about his words before  using them oh i love when this happens  he was obviously just reading the  teleprompter and and i guess there were  no commas or so he just sometimes the  copies like that when i read i understand  at least have you used your brain to  adjust kind of adjust sometimes not but  sometimes uh a reader what did the  reader say good evening i'm dr sanjay gupta  filling in for anderson cooper tonight  uh tonight he literally wrote the book on  how to have sex with children a how-to book  for pedophiles basically if you say yeah 
[01:21:00]  it almost sounds like like anderson  right cooper wrote this book he didn't  write that book literally wrote the book  on how to have sex with children but he  didn't but he didn't he's just sick how  was that supposed to have been said it  was supposed to say like uh i'm in for  anderson cooper and here's our top story  or here's he wrote the book like i'm in  for anderson cooper period he wrote the  book on how to blah blah children's i will  be talking about and then whatever that 
[01:21:30]  guy's name but instead he said uh  anderson cooper's out sick he literally  wrote the book right he didn't pause no  period no no re reboot now people think  anderson cooper wrote a book about how to  have sex with children thanks to dr sanjay  gupta not as far as i know right all  right that's all we need to know john in  jersey johnny hey how you doing  do it for johnny yeah listen uh you know  when we go camping at night getting back 
[01:22:00]  to the uh loaner clips and all that stuff  uh if you look up at the sky at night uh  good clear night you could just sit there  and watch the satellites go by we finally  started doing that out in uh south hold  on uh the end of long island under a  little campfire and in my brother's  backyard of course all illegal and we  would uh look up at the sky and yeah  you're right you could see fucking  satellites have you ever seen satellites  going by it i always think they're kind  of uh little stars or planes or little 
[01:22:30]  planes yeah yeah no uh we counted you  notice that there's a lot of them when  you start looking for it holy shit they're  watching us beep beep there's a lot of  shit up there yeah a lot of shit just  circling around waiting to come crashing  down on us johnny what were you gonna  oh yeah well we counted about 11 satellites  uh a night you know  i mean it's really easy to see you just  uh sit there and watch and uh they go by  um faster than planes but uh a lot uh 
[01:23:00]  slower than everybody else so yeah you  could definitely uh see that there's  satellites it took about a minute to  cross the sky  it just sounds like a thrill a minute  being out in the woods looking up at the  sky toasting some marshmallows yeah  trying to figure out if it's a plane  or a satellite  camping is definitely you definitely  know it's a satellite  don't like camping i don't like bed and  breakfasts i like fancy hotels because i 
[01:23:30]  could throw my shit all over the place  and someone cleans it up they got fancy  camping gear now though yeah you ever  been to the adirondacks there's nothing  worse than waking up and it's cold and  you gotta fucking get out of your tent and  and and knock ice off with some water  to fucking splash your face and it's  just an inconvenience why do it it's  all part of the experience waking up all  it stinks waking up all cramped because  you're you're trying to keep your your  core temperature yeah why would i want 
[01:24:00]  to do that so you're trying to get into  the smallest ball possible i just want  to turn you know what i want to do i  want to turn the thermostat up uh that's  all i want to do why is it always cold  when you camp i just want to go camping in  the middle of fucking august and it's  freezing out yeah it's what i want to do  i want i want to go to a hotel turn the  heat up i want to throw my shit all over  the place i want to walk around  scratching my fucking self going to the  bathroom uh that's why i don't like the  bed and breakfast either and we've had 
[01:24:30]  that discussion you got to deal with  people i don't particularly know or want  to know you deal with uh the couples  from jersey and then you got to sit at a  table and eat you've done this right yeah  you have to sit at a table in the  morning like like there's a time that  you have to get up yeah the guy like  they make you get up do they knock on  your door and go breakfast it's usually  a guy okay not officially but what guy  would open breakfast but a gay guy you  could draw your own conclusions don't  ask don't tell he makes breakfast for 
[01:25:00]  everybody oh great hoping he's got a  weak one in his kitchen oh really hoping  he sees a mark that's the only reason  you go into that shit oh or you're or  you're a couple that likes to swing  really does that's the only reason you  would do that breakfast thing is all  about that's what i think people getting  pussy from uh from being owners of bed  and breakfasts they should do an expose  has anyone done a doc yet on this i want  to do a bed and breakfast doc  about yeah i know there's sex going on 
[01:25:30]  i stayed at one in my hiney hurt the  next day i think they slipped me a  roof and all it is i'm driving it is a  very strange experience yeah within an  hour you you have to act like you've  known these people for 10 years i don't  want to do that i don't want to do that  i want to leave my clothes laying around  then you feel obligated to to exchange  phone numbers and emails at the end of  it like what what the fuck i was here  for a night and a half and when you take  a piss you got to like hit the water  you can't miss and hit the edge of the 
[01:26:00]  bowl right uh yeah don't you have to  clean up a little in the bathroom too  well that's what human beings do fuck  that in a hotel i will take a washcloth  now at home when i bathe let me let you  in on a little secret it's an anthony  fun fact when i bathe and i soap up  that washcloth and and get all a good  the last place i wash is your boy is  the most horrible place yeah you wash  underneath the carriage and stuff like  that the undercarriage front to back  hopefully front to back right the last  thing to touch the washcloth is anus 
[01:26:30]  the anal cavity anus and uh then once  you're done you give it a good mom down  by the river little house on the prairie  a scrubbing with more soap in the water  and then you wring it out make sure it's  clean enough and then wash your face and  then no no no and then you hang it up to  dry and then next time i use the washcloth  i i wet the washcloth you said you're in  good hotels they give you new no no this  is at home oh i'm sorry and soap it up  again and stuff like that and wash it 
[01:27:00]  it's always clean in a hotel i will  fucking scrub a dub dub my bung and then  just take the washcloth and go thwock  against the wall in the shower because i  ain't using that one again there's another  good one hanging right there but that's  what i want to do now in a bed and  breakfast i can't leave towels laying  around and then what about jizz towels now  when you're you're having sex and you  use your towel to kind of you know  clean up shit from getting on the bed and 
[01:27:30]  wiping off and things like that where's  that towel going you know i know where  it goes in my house it goes where it goes  on the floor in a bed and breakfast it  goes in the hamper and they worship for  the next person but are they looking at  your jizz stains i'm sure they get off on  that why else would they have a bed and  breakfast god with names like the  jungle room the guy's making his tea with  it he's dunking your fucking your jizz  rag in his hot water look i'm not a fan  of the bed and breakfast i hate the bed 
[01:28:00]  and breakfast have i been to a couple  over the years yes i've been to a few  yeah yeah i don't know i told you about  the one out in the hamptons right we  decided to do a hamptons weekend me and  my wife and uh and of course i'm last  minute all with everything so kenny got  me a bed and breakfast oh no and it was  on the outskirts of town i mean way on  the outskirts of town and it was it was  the it was the house where we were  convinced we were gonna get murdered i  told the story where our room had i am  not exaggerating and unfortunately she 
[01:28:30]  doesn't like being on the radio because  she'd back me up we had at least 12  chairs in our room why i don't know and  and then old photos of people that were  long fucking dead it was so creepy she  was scared all night it's supposed to be  this nice romantic yeah yeah hamptons  experience and she was scared shitless  the idiots that run these places and i  don't blame her charming and then when  we pulled up it was uh i guess it was  july 4th weekend the guy was chopping  wood in the backyard in july well you 
[01:29:00]  know it's got a season and then we we  did a little research and we learned  that uh the mom had the bed and  breakfast and she passed and now the  guy isn't a bed and breakfast guy but  you know you don't see the guy running  the bed and breakfast handling an axe at  any time that's what that's when we  pulled up yeah and then uh when we  finally were out of there howdy i think  we only stayed a day i if i stayed two  days and i really am a bad person um  and i told you we wanted to get coffee  to go yeah and i go hey we'd like some 
[01:29:30]  coffee to go because the coffee looked  like it was okay i wouldn't eat anything  else and he goes one moment and i told  you the story he comes back with two  dunkin donuts cups from the back that  still had coffee stains in them and had  the lids that were already used and he  pops the lid and i see like it that it's  a used cup and then he pours our coffee  in in in that thinking it's completely  acceptable holy fuck see fuck that but  i would be calling management at the  hotel desk but then i get a dirty shit 
[01:30:00]  and fucking cup but then you don't want  to call the guy out on it because you're  still in his creepy house i i'm like  thank you i made believe i did a fake  sip throw it in his face and then we  scalding hot coffee in his face and  then we made the mistake of dumping it  in his uh in his uh driveway which  probably pissed him off after we left  fuck him but  a used coffee used cups so you're right  the bed and breakfast experience is not  good i just can't imagine nope by the  way getting back to the washcloth i got  to give props to jay moore one of my 
[01:30:30]  favorite oh yeah one of my favorite  bits that he uh he did was the magic  soap magic soap and every time i'm at  my in-laws down in philly i think about  the magic soap because magic soap because  there's the magic soap in the uh in the  uh the shower cleans itself it's the only  reason why have we decided as a society  that it's okay to use someone else's bar  of soap because and as jay says think of  the first place you wash right and the  last place somebody else washes right so  when that soap is sitting there it's the 
[01:31:00]  magic soap self-cleaning soap is such a  pain in the ass you don't want to just use  it one time yeah so you just go i'll just  use the magic soap that's it knowing  that yes somebody was washing their ass  and now you're washing your face with  it i have my own bar of soap but you  never think twice about it no but jay  moore does a whole bit on which is uh  which is terrific but yeah uh i like a i  like a nice big fucking like real shower  like a hotel you stay in a modern hotel  these days they knew they they figured  out like showers have to be big so you 
[01:31:30]  not banging your elbows while you're  washing your hair or the dumb curtain  the shower curtain that's a thing of the  50s no shower curtains anymore i want  glass nice little glass uh shower door  yeah and separate tub and shower right i  don't want to be standing in a fucking uh  a walk it's too easy to slip the sides go  up it's crazy  uh moving on to some material material where 
[01:32:00]  we can wait we got david tell here we  can take a break here get david here we  got to talk about the governor uh in a  lot of trouble for buying yankees tickets  uh for receiving yankees tickets that's  receiving he didn't buy him oh that's  what i mean receiving uh tickets so he's  fine for that a lot of money too and  remember when larry king said he wants to  do stand-up now that he's not doing his  tv show he was kidding right well jay leno  gave him a chance to do some stand-up last  night he's kidding right we got larry king  doing his stand-up so we should play that 
[01:32:30]  uh when david tell is here a very funny  comic as we all know yes oh spider-man  play yes very big here in new york we'll  do that after the break too  and so my fellow americans love love this is a virus on sirius xm  da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da 
[01:33:00]  Where is the bell, wait for the bell  Can't eat the bell, where is the bell  Ding-fi-da-dun, ding-fi-da-dun  Ding-fi-da-dun, ding-fi-da-dun  I was a fucking king  Making paper whoppers, I would paper  Would you like an apple-paradet 
[01:33:30]  Would you like an apple-paradet  Ding-fi-da-dun, ding-fi-da-dun  Ding-fi-da-dun  Ding-fi-da-dun  The Obi and Anthony Show  On the virus  All right, ding-fries are done, huh?  That's classic  I want to hear some of the ones we played yesterday  Oh God, no, I hated those  I want to hear the fruitcake one  From Fred Schneider 
[01:34:00]  Fruitcake  Of the B-52s  And what was the other one with that  That tranny  Father Christmas, fuck my pussy  That's really the meaning of Christmas  The one I really liked yesterday  What was his name?  James Smith came in  He's playing Caroline's New Year's Eve  Yeah  And that  Where's my fucking bike?  With the accent and stuff  My fucking bike  That was pretty good  Maybe E-Rock can play that one  Going into break for everybody 
[01:34:30]  I guess it was huge in Australia  And the guy himself is huge  And we never heard of him  In the United States of America  So, David Tell is smoking  He'll be up here in a few minutes  David Tell  He's smoking?  He's smoking, yes  Jesus  It's a hell of a habit  Isn't it cold out today?  It's cold  And  That's when I understand  You smokers are addicted  When you're sitting outside  When it's single digits  To have you smoke  Damn, that sucks  Amazing  Governor Patterson  Is he still the governor?  Nah  He's the lame duck 
[01:35:00]  He's the lame duck right now, right?  Yes  Our blind governor is on the way out  Waiting for Cuomo to come in  And he's going to miss all the help he gets  What do you mean?  He just becomes a civilian  Yeah, he doesn't get all the  Who's going to help him with all that blind stuff?  I think he did that beforehand  Yeah, but he got comfortable  He probably did  They're fining him $62,000 over free Yankee tickets  That's very, very expensive tickets at that point  $62,000 for a few Yankee tickets 
[01:35:30]  You can't let the guy slide knowing he's blind  He didn't even see the game  Was he there?  I would have fought with that  Like, hey, look  I didn't see the game  Was he there, though?  I think he was  Is that or  Would he give them away?  I don't even know  But he wasn't supposed to even get them  So that's a no-no?  Yeah  I know  Even in radio  It's tough to get free stuff  That used to be the best part of the job  You got free fucking stuff  Free swag  And tickets  And now everything has to be accounted for  And there's paperwork 
[01:36:00]  And, you know, in Anthony's case  He thought the company was doing the right thing  You had to pay for Yankee's tickets, too  I was supposed to  Oh, good point  Never, never paid  Good for you  I wasn't going to pay for it  You never know, though  They might have taken it out of your check  They probably did  You know what?  I'm laughing  And I shouldn't be  You're probably right  They probably did that  They probably took it out of my check  Without telling you  Now, I guess when Giuliani was mayor  Mayor  I guess he  I guess he paid for his tickets  Oh, really?  I guess so 
[01:36:30]  Because it probably would have been bad  If the Yankees organization  Would have been the same thing  Given him tickets  Because he was always there  There's got to be a way  Of giving these guys tickets  Without giving them tickets  If you know what I mean  Oh, like kind of backdoor deal  A little backdoor deal  Nothing wrong with a good backdoor deal  Oh, yeah  But 62  It's actually 62,125  Where did they come up  With that little tidy sum?  I don't know  That would involve reading  Kind of a weird number  I don't know why he was fine that much 
[01:37:00]  Yeah  Why they came up with that figure  I don't know  God, that would be fucking angering  It's like the games are over  You saw them a while ago  Sure  It's like you've got to shell out  All that money  Fuck that  Hey, to the people  That might come to New York  And see a Broadway show  I would strongly suggest  You go see Colin Quinn's  Yes  Long story short  It's fantastic  The Helen Hayes Theater  And I would strongly suggest  You avoid Spider-Man  Which they're starting to say  Is the biggest disaster  In Broadway history  Now they're in preview still, right? 
[01:37:30]  Yeah  I guess U2 does the music  And are they financing this  Or something?  They got a bunch of money  In this damn thing  Yeah, I mean  They're definitely investors  They got a stake in it  They're investors  And they've decided  That this Spider-Man thing  Was going to be state-of-the-art  Where you pretty much  Look up the entire time  Yeah  And watch Spidey  Flying from this part of the theater  To this part of the theater  And here's the deal  In the movies  Spider-Man's amazing  He's the amazing Spider-Man  Sure  And he's zipping around  On his webs  And flying through the streets 
[01:38:00]  And doing all kinds of  Acrobatics with these webs  That's a movie  Right  In real life  They wanted to  Kind of portray the same thing  But live  And on a stage  With cables  Right  This is proving to be a disaster  And very dangerous  Well, we lost an actor last night  I mean, he's not dead  But he went flying  He was very injured  Where did he fly into?  The audience?  Yeah, well, I mean  There was like a raised up  Platform that was way high  It's on the commercials too 
[01:38:30]  And he kind of fell  Forward toward the audience  Probably into the little pit  He fell like two stories  Oh, that's it  And he got very injured  Very injured  Oh, they showed him  Out on a  Getting taken out  On a stretcher  And he was all  Had that neck thing on  Yeah  That oops  Let's put this around  His neck thing  And was he  Was he Spider-Man?  He was a stunt double  For Spider-Man  So was he in the  Spider-Man costume?  Because all I want to know  Is did they have to take him 
[01:39:00]  To the hospital  Dressed as Spider-Man?  Because that would be  Really embarrassing  Okay, look  Spider-Man's hurt  And how gay is he?  Because it's Broadway  Very  You think?  I think he's probably very  And I bet the costume  Has a big bulge  In the front  A dance belt?  Yes  A dance belt?  What is that?  Oh, you never see  It's what the guys  Have to wear  I think it's called  A dance belt  Oh, I think  Now it's like  Oh, I think  I don't know anything about it  Wouldn't that just be a cup?  Yeah, what's a dance belt? 
[01:39:30]  If it's football  It's a cup  Because we always wondered  Why  If it's Broadway  It's a dance belt  When guys are dancing  They always have that big bowl  Well, yeah, because they've got to have that big bowl  Because a cup  You can't dance in a cup  It's hard  It doesn't move with you  Why does it have to be in the shape of a bikini?  Because I think if the guys were wearing those tights that they wear when they jump around  You would just see their cock and it would be very disturbing  And no lines on these fellas  No lines  Have you ever worn one of these?  I never  Why would I have worn a dance belt?  Why did you wear one of these? 
[01:40:00]  What does the back look like, though?  Is it like a thong?  Yeah, I would think  Because it's got a couple of balls  Yeah, there's the butt cheek  So it would be a thong  Does this picture have a 360 degree view?  These are terrible  A dance belt  A dance belt  A dance belt  Look up dance belts online  Oh, yeah, here you go  Could you please explain to me how you knew this?  Oh, my God  You know what that string on the dance belt must smell like after a fucking show?  It is indeed a thong  Dude, it's a tea bag 
[01:40:30]  It's a thong  And if you ever saw Super Troopers  The bulletproof cup that one of the cops were wearing down at the range  It's shaped exactly like that  Only it's skin-toned  And they wear this underneath their leotard  Yeah, their tights and stuff like that  Their tights  Yeah  The dance belt  I was wondering why they had that giant bulge in the front  But it wasn't really a cock bulge  No, it was a dance belt  It's just a generic bulge  And this is so their dick doesn't flop around? 
[01:41:00]  It's so it doesn't flop around  So it doesn't get knocked into, like, the side of their leg  Yeah  And so there's no lines  Do you think, like, that back portion just soaks up cum?  I don't know for sure  But there's a huge possibility  How are you doing, Dave?  David Tell, how are you, sir?  Take a seat, grab a mic, have some fun  We're just here for the holidays  Because you were smoking, we decided to kind of stall a little bit  So we're looking at dance belts right now  I hope you don't mind  Yeah  Who wouldn't?  That's how the Broadway stars keep their cock in place 
[01:41:30]  That's a cock piece, yeah  Yeah  But they call them dance belts on Broadway  We started talking about the Spider-Man debacle  Oh, yeah, that's a heartache  Yeah, isn't it?  Yeah, you know, I don't know about you guys  But there's definitely a need for  I would have went with Thor and Spider-Man  So he could have fixed things as they went awry  With his hammer, as people are plummeting to their deaths  Yeah, somebody  He could fix it  He could, you know, definitely take care of that  But now a guy got hurt, he didn't die, right?  No, he fell 
[01:42:00]  He was on one of those dumb rigs that they got with a cable  And something happened that he fell  Two stories  Yeah  To the horror of the audience  Can you imagine that?  No  No  This is going to be the biggest bomb  Of all the way to die?  Yeah  Wow  Dressed in a Spider-Man  In a dance belt  Just surrounded by it  In a dance belt  Bunch of guys that don't know how to give fucking mouth to mouth  All those little kids  Trying to breathe into your dick  All those kids  Like who came for the holidays  I want to see my hero Spider-Man  Then he can't climb like they all thought  And he just falls  And then on the way out 
[01:42:30]  They see a Santa drinking out of a paper bag  The true New York experience  New York in the holidays  A good way to really hurt the children's whole take on Christmas  And this thing is in preview still  They don't even have an opening night set  No  They're still pushing it back  Well the previews are meant to kind of tweak  Tweak this production  Well it's 65 million dollars right?  Jesus  Yeah  So that's how many Trons?  How much is that in Tron?  That's like half a Tron 
[01:43:00]  I don't know how they're going to make up that money  What do tickets go for for this stupid thing?  A lot  Yeah  100 bucks?  200 bucks?  No way  It's got to be more than that  300 bucks  It's worth it though right?  Yeah  Spider-Man  Somebody might die  That's kind of cool  That is pretty good  It's like ancient theater  Like watching Gladiators  Yes  They're going to have to put a wall out front  Like the Vietnam wall  For all the people that died  Doing this stupid show  A memorial fucking granite plaque  Enough of the dance belt 
[01:43:30]  David Teller is in studio  Yeah you can take that fucking dance belt down  Sorry you had to see that Dave  And what that string must smell like after a show though  Is just beyond me  I can't imagine  Don't ask, don't tell  I thought you were here to promote the big show at the Bregada  But you're playing Carolines I see  Yeah it's a one-two punch  I'm like a  I'm not only here to promote the Bregada, Carolines  And also there's a benefit for Greg Giraldo  Yes  In February  It's going to be a big show here in New York City  But I'm also here just to represent all the comics who faked calling in saying they couldn't come 
[01:44:00]  How many guys said they were sick?  Yeah, yeah  Right?  I had the flu  Patrice said he was sick and he was throwing up all night  Oh really?  Yeah  Okay  Yeah  Alright  Well anyway  Jimmy's in LA being a Hollywood star  Yeah  Alright  I treat her like a job  That's what I'm saying, you know  I said I'm going to come, I'm here  Yeah, you're in  Alright  Same thing with Spider-Man  I mean, a show's so bad it kills Hal Linden  I mean 
[01:44:30]  Did you guys get into that yet?  Hal Linden  From Barney Miller  If a show can take down Barney Miller  Who is the thinking man's Leslie Nielsen  With so  Alright  Anyway, but yeah  No, I'm doing Caroline's Christmas week  Which is always a joy  Yes  I mean that  Caroline's is nice  I like Caroline's  The day after Christmas  Christmas week's got to be a joy though  There's nothing better in a, you know, a recession  With a new flat screen TV out there 
[01:45:00]  Let's go see some old  Hack comic  Oh shit  Let's go see some dick jokes  Some midget jokes  Instead of buying a 3D TV  But no, I appreciate it  It's going to be  It should be a good show  I'm not there alone  April Macy's going to be with me  Super cool  Yeah  And Amy Schumer  Who comes on the show a lot  Amy  She's going to be doing the show  We like the Amy Schumer  She's great  Amy's great  So it's going to be a fun time  I like that girl  Yeah  Something about her  There was something there  She's cool  Whatever 
[01:45:30]  Oh, Larry King  Yes  Larry King wants to be a stand-up comic  What?  Isn't that what he's been doing on his show?  It's fucking  We're bummed he's gone  It's tragic comedy  We were enjoying all his fuck-ups, David Tell  I love  And now he's gone  I love the fact that  Did you see his goodbye speech?  Oh, yeah  Wasn't that great?  Touching  He's like, I'm leaving, but I'm not  And then he promoted like three things he's going to do  Something like an hour special  But those are all the fake things they give these people  They've been around too long 
[01:46:00]  They just told them  They did that to Dan Rather  You never saw him  Dan Rather  They did it to fucking  Tom Brokaw  Tom Brokaw  If you're up in the middle of the night  Maybe you see one of his one-hour specials  Every so often  It's like, yeah  I'm here in the Sudan  Right  It's like, what the fuck  He's a tragedy behind  Yeah, yeah  Tragedy behind  Haiti  Just had an earthquake  Right  But I  We look back at Panama  American's locker room  Scotland crowd  Right  But, yeah  I do love Larry King 
[01:46:30]  And it was sad that he was replaced by an English fancy boy  Which I thought was like just another job going overseas  Yeah  Look at that  Yeah  Another job  That we're subbing out  Yeah  To another country  Now who is that guy?  Is he good?  What did he do?  Piers, one of the judges on America's Got Talent  He seems stuffy  And he's kind of like a Simon Cowell  Where, you know, he's tough  He's tough  He tells it like it is  He tells it like it is, exactly  English-like, though  Yeah, so he is  We like it  He's not even going to put up with any shit when he's interviewing these people 
[01:47:00]  He was also the celebrity apprentice  Was he?  Oh, yeah  He was on that show  He won  Oh, yeah  He beat Trace Atkins  Oh, wow  Shit, that's a big win  Alright, that's a resume stuffer then  That's a big one  That qualifies you to interview people  Politicians  That just gives hope to anybody who's ever on a Survivor  See?  See?  How did they  You know that show's still on?  It is  I couldn't believe it  I gave up on Survivor 10 years ago  But they had the season finale 
[01:47:30]  And the live reunion show  Like they've been doing  I don't know  I guess it's still doing big numbers  They're in Nicaragua, I think  Wasn't that the last season?  Really?  Yeah, they're slowly heading back towards the States  You're going to see an Oakland coming pretty soon  Survivor, oh, well  That would be a tough one  Who wouldn't watch that one?  Survivor Camden  Yeah  Now that's worth watching  I don't know  Who the hell is watching that garbage?  I don't know, man  It's still big numbers  I've so had it with reality programming  Oh, man  We did bridalplasty 
[01:48:00]  Nah, even that  You've got to be at the bridalplasty  No, I'm kind of getting into this new generation of reality shows  Which have nothing to do with reality  It's people  We've actually gotten to the point where it's people buying shit out of storage lockers  Yes  And people are watching it  Yes  And they're fucking like  Wow, what did he get in there?  Oh, that's a good one  Fuck, he got that  It's storage locker shit  It's like, I think he got a good locker  He only paid like 80 bucks for it  Why are we compelled to watch people pick through other people's junk  Pay them like 10 bucks for it 
[01:48:30]  And then sell it for 60 bucks  And these shows are fucking getting amazing ratings  I didn't even know you could buy other people's lockers  Who cares?  That's kind of cool  People who default on their locker  On their storage locker  Yeah  Mostly like, I guess, private investigators or musicians  Like bands that go, you know  They were selling a lot of people that  In L.A. they got a lot of these  Because a lot of people go out for the L.A. Dream  It tanks  Right  They put their shit in storage  Move back home  Wherever that might be  Or they might just be sucking cock on Hollywood Boulevard 
[01:49:00]  That's true  Don't have time to  Plan B, as we call it  Plan B  Plan B  I'm either going to make it  Or I'm  I'm either going to be in the King speech  Or I'm going to suck a cock  I mean  With a pin named King  That's kind of true  Quite a drop off between A and B  There's no real middle ground there  Yeah  And then they have these storage lockers  And then  Apparently, I never knew this  After a certain amount of time  After they default  Anyone can have them  People come in  They lift the door open  You got like a flashlight  If you're like one of the fucking pros 
[01:49:30]  And you look in  They give you like a few minutes  Yeah  To look around  And then they go  Okay, enough looking  Bid on it  And then you gotta judge by  What furniture is in there  And how many sealed up boxes and shit  Whether it's a good buy  For a certain amount of money  It just doesn't sound legal  It doesn't sound interesting  It's a fucking TV show  Where I could give a shit  What have they found?  You're watching  I saw two episodes of this  And what was the best thing they found?  The best thing was  The guy found like a black powder gun 
[01:50:00]  Which was kind of cool  But  And that was like it  They found like a  Happy Days looking jukebox in one  And then it's like this big thing  Well, let's go to our jukebox expert  And he looks and he's like  Well, I like the glasswork on this  And I would  I would say this is worth about $2,300  And he's like  Well, what would you give it to  Give to me for right now?  Oh  I'll give you $13  How about $18?  How about $14?  And then you watch these guys haggle 
[01:50:30]  And I'm looking  Who's watching this  For not like  I have to watch it  You're watching  For the show  I have to watch it for this  Oh, that's a good excuse  It's work  I was working  You know the guy who restores things  For the Pawn Stars?  Who doesn't?  He got his own show  A spin-off  Yes, he got a spin-off  Restory?  The guy who restores  Coke machines  What are you talking about?  It's his own show  Yeah, there's a pawn shop  Which is good  And people bring shit in  And sell it  And again, they gotta get the experts  See how much it's worth  And they try to finagle the guy down  A few shekels  He doesn't like when you say 
[01:51:00]  Nagel like that  Oh, Nagel  Yeah, that's  Sorry, Nagel  And then  His last name has become a verb  David Tell  Just so you know  He nagled up the show yesterday  I hear  The replay  He nagled the replay  Pretty badly yesterday  I kept getting Twitter  It's like  Why did it go from  Today's show to  I'm listening to shit  From a month ago  It got nagled  It got nagled  Yeah  It's an official  Nagelization of the program  Yes, it is  And then there's always  A conspiracy that  Management took that segment out  No  Yes  It's just another fuck up  Everyone will always  Start going like  I think it was a conspiracy  They were talking about 
[01:51:30]  Something the government  Didn't want you to know  Troy started questioning things  Oh, is that it?  Yeah  Someone tweeted me  And said we should just  Escort Troy out of the building  For his dumb take  On the fucking Pentagon  It was a missile  Was it a missile?  You think it was a missile  That hit the Pentagon  A missile?  Yeah  I thought it was supposed  To be a plane, right?  Yeah  Isn't that what we told?  In that  An out of control  Plane  Or a plane guided  To destroy something 
[01:52:00]  Is indeed literally  A missile  And a missile  Is just  It's a projectile  So yeah  You could say a missile  But it wasn't  A fucking cruise missile  Or anything  Troy  Stop  Can we get an escort  Out of the building?  Yeah  I can make that  Without his coat  What other shows  Have you guys  Like  Okay  So the storage  Yeah  The storage locker one  I think it's called storage wars  Storage wars  They make it sound very competitive  At least they're finding  More stuff than  Geraldo ever did  Exactly  You know something  Yeah  So 
[01:52:30]  And then there's  Well actually  There is one that I do  Watch  Hoarders  Hoarders is great  Hoarders rules  Where you get  These fat  Disgusting  Selfish pigs  In these houses  That are stuffed  To the rafters  With shit they've bought  Over the years  That they won't get rid of  Right  Yet the most important thing  To them is their family  That they haven't seen in years  Because of their shit  Because of the hoarding  Because of the hoarding  Which obviously is more important  Than the family  But they cry  And be like  My daughter has not brought  My grandchildren over in years 
[01:53:00]  Yeah  How does that make you feel  If you're a family member  That  That you're less important  Than her shit  That the cat  Carcasses  Is more important than you  I love when they pull up stuff  From like  And it's  It is like sediment  In a cliff  They pull like  The top layers  Or clothing  That she just recently bought  And by the bottom  You get into the pet rocks  And mood rings  And crushed cat heads  Right  And rat shit  And they just  And they're like  And we were goofing  On the shrinks  That come into these  Fucking places too  Yeah  Because they walk in like 
[01:53:30]  Hi  How are you  Why don't you tell me  About this room  Oh  It's packed with shit  Literally  My husband died  Under it  We haven't found him yet  Yeah  And I can't  Bring myself  To throw anything away  Well now they have  The other  The next level  Is animal hoarding  Have you seen that  Animal hoarders  Saw that one  I want to be that guy  You got too many monkeys  I mean  Two  How about two  How hard is it  I'll trade you  A parrot  For three lizards 
[01:54:00]  No  They really tell  And they're like  How many parrots  Equal a child  I love my birds  And I don't  And then you get  Animal control  Come in  And they're like  Alright  You're gonna have to pick  You can keep five of them  That's so great  You gotta get rid of  A hundred and thirty  Sophie's choice  They're just pulling  Fucking  A mingle at the train platform  Thumbs down  Thumbs up  Just get rid of the 
[01:54:30]  Dumb birds  That's a great idea  For like a talent show  For animals  Which is like  I want to stay alive  You know  So then they have to be cool  And exciting  Yeah  They gotta do something  I'm sorry  I can only keep one of you  So you're gonna have to  Step it up  You gotta do something  Worth having  Around my house  Entertain me  Animal hoarders  I like that one  I like hoarders  I'm not into like  The motorcycle ones  Those are kind of  Passé now  Although they try to  They try to make  The other one  Kind of interesting 
[01:55:00]  Now by pitting  Father against son  That's always good  And it's so real  No it's not real  If they hated each other  They wouldn't do  The show together  Why don't we ask  It would be like  Like them  Like  Because they literally  Can't work together  Right  But oh they're there  For you know  The little  They're there for the cameras  Yeah  If they really hated each other  They wouldn't even be doing the show  Yeah  Hey what does David Tell watch  You're asking us all the questions  What's your show  I watch of course  16 and Pregnant  Nice  I love that one 
[01:55:30]  We talked about that one  You did  That's a good one  Now did you talk about  Like the people  They turn away  No  Like I'm sorry  It's 16 and Pregnant  Not 15  Can you wait  Can you wait  That's my joke  Hold it in  That's my joke  I like  I like your joke  I like any kind of  Like terrorist show  Like why is Bin Laden  Still alive  Which is the longest thing  Ever to DVR  When you're wasted  Like okay  I gotta  What  How do you  So that's like 
[01:56:00]  A discovery  No National Geographic  Which is pretty cool  They got some pretty good ones  Locked Up Abroad  I love that too  Yeah  They're running out of cool  Locked Up  So you know  That's the problem  With that shit  There's I Survived  I like that one  That's a good one  Where it's people  Although the recaps  Much too  They do too many recaps  On that show  I feel if you missed  The first 15 minutes  Just figure it out yourself  Assume the woman  Has been raped  80 times already  Assume the guy  Fell off a cliff  And a branch 
[01:56:30]  Went through his throat  But they got the best people  To play them  In the reenactment  There was the better looking  Affordable actor  The better looking version  Of these people  That have fucked themselves up  Yeah  And then you see the real  You're like  Really  That's the best thing  That ever happened to you  Wow  Some Scottish  You know  Some Scottish four and a half  Was stuck in Peru  For eight months  That's great  And then of course  I like Man vs. Food  Do you watch that?  Oh yeah  I watched that one  Yeah  But yeah 
[01:57:00]  I agree with you  On the whole  You know  I guess I watched  A little bit of  Celebrity Rehab  But I guess I'm behind  On the  I'm not  See those I can't  Really get into  I need the real  Quirky dumb ones  That you wouldn't think  Would be entertaining at all  But somehow I get  Fixated on them  Like an infomercial  Like  Infomercials also  Are things that  I'll just be like  Wow  Check that out  I'm watching something  On this stupid  Rotisserie thing  And it's infuriating  Yet entertaining  At the same time  Because you know  It's fake  It's like 
[01:57:30]  And look  Five seconds later  And you see the cut  And they go from that  To the juicer  They're kind of getting lazy  With those  I think because  Everybody's on to it  It doesn't matter  Alaska's becoming  A giant thing  With reality shows  I'm not into that though  Well they got  Sarah Palin's  Got her show  But then they got  Ice Road Trucker  They got Alaskan Air now  Which is like  An airplane show  Ice Road Trucker  That should be a cool show  I didn't see that yet  Alaskan Air  Where they're just  Flying into Alaska  And dropping shit off  Those are the guys  Who like  They wanted to get a job  With a real airline  But it's like 
[01:58:00]  You know  What do you mean  I can't  Fuck you  You know  It's like  Next thing  You're in a pontoon  Playing  You know  Driving a half Eskimo  Somewhere  Not even landing  They just get low  And drop shit out  Yeah I like  I like how they  Concentrate on all  Like the  You know  We had to bring  The medicines  To the  You know  Distant whatever  You don't hear  About all the  Drug drops  And like crazy  Other things  That are going on  Yeah  How are they  Really making their money  I mean  Everyone can't be  Like you know  A pregnant Eskimo  Had to be rushed  To a hospital  How many people  Really need help  Yeah  Not as many of the 
[01:58:30]  Survivor  Who lives  He needed uranium  For some reason  He needed a centrifuge  You know they're  Dropping sex toys  And all sorts of shit  They got a lot of those  Though  And I think the first  One of these  Quirky ones  Was Deadliest Catch  I love that  With the crabbers  Who thought crabbing  Would be interesting  But I found it  Pretty interesting  That's more dangerous  Than being in the  New hit show  Spider-Man  Yeah  I mean honestly  Barely  But it is  It's  Yeah  You never realize 
[01:59:00]  When you're  Just looking at  Those awful crab legs  Especially  What a waste  To have them  Go to the Red Lobster  Like  Someone died  Someone died  So somebody  Could take their date  To the Red Lobster  At least when you  Watch that show  Some real shit  Could happen  Yeah  And then that  Was successful  So what do they do  The lobster guys  Yeah that isn't as exciting  It's not as dangerous  To get the lobsters  Alert  Not as dangerous  But it's kind of racist  If you ask me  I mean it's all these  White guys fishing  I mean where are the  Urban  Big quotes in the air  I don't really see those 
[01:59:30]  We're the urban shows  Yeah what  Are there any urban reality shows  Like this  No  I mean I know there's  Kind of the  Yeah it's called Cops  Real House  Yeah okay  Because they don't have  A hip name for them  Like Off the Hook  Or  Yeah  What's cooking  What's cooking  Off the Hook  Would be a great  Black fishing show  That's right  That's my idea  Off the Hook  Off the Hook  We fished the most  Urban settings  Right  Like the Harlem River  Alright let's see  What's coming out of there  Could be Chilean Seed Bass  Might be a dead hooker  It doesn't matter  We're going to eat it  Some fucking  They just dredged up 
[02:00:00]  An accountant  With a grappling hook  A pit bull  Not again  A dead pit bull  An accountant  I'm in  Fucking David Tell jokes  But I'd watch that show  Every week  Because there's some shit  In that river  Off the Hook  Fuck  Yeah B.E.T.'s got to get on the ball  Because A&E  I'm telling you  I want to do it  Off the Hook  Yeah  It's just a dude  His  Of course the guy  Who works the turntable  Yeah  Oh you're going to have  Somebody mixing  Yeah  So like  You know  That's his like  Soundtrack  You know  On the boat  We put the bait in 
[02:00:30]  You know  But they're so close to land  They can hear like  You know  Like whatever  Their girlfriends  Every screen  Hey  How come you didn't  Oh shit  Whatever  I don't know  I'm shopping it around  Mostly  You know  Work on that  In my own house  I see  I'd be watching it  But I'm glad that you guys  Watch reality too  Because don't you feel like  There's a cut off  Between like  Where you're like  You know  Alright enough already  I've got to watch  Like a real show  Like do you  You like real  Like history  Don't you  I watch a lot of  Documentaries  A lot of history shows  Let's talk about  Mark Twain for a bit  Mark Twain  Now I haven't  Good water 
[02:01:00]  You haven't seen  Then you must have a life  Because  I watched nine hours  Of Twain  Wow  Yeah  That Ken Burns man  He can lock you in  With that bowl cut of his  Alright  If it's Ken Burns  Now  Now I'm in  Because I watched that  God damn Civil War thing  Like it was  Oh that was great  The real Civil War  That was great  How he was able  To make a documentary  Without one moving picture  He'd just take a picture  And kind of  Move it to the side a little  It was the anti-avatar  Yeah  It was like the total  It was  If they played the two of those together 
[02:01:30]  It would blow people's eyeballs  Right out of their head  It's  There were photographs  That he'd zoom in on  And be like  You know  Andrew Jackson  And then they'd have  The people there  Well let me tell you  It was very difficult  That winter  When we  And they'd just  Slowly zoom in  On a photograph of him  You're like  I haven't seen one thing  Move this entire documentary  And you're all in  I was all in  I loved it  And now it's called  The Ken Burns effect  They do  They actually call it  They sell it on like  Well it's on  iMovie  And stuff  Use the Ken Burns effect  And you take a picture  And you can just 
[02:02:00]  Sweep across it  And be just as good  As Ken Burns  I'm sure  That's great  Well you can't give away  The whole photograph  That's the key  Because you know something  Nothing is better than  Home movies  With the Ken Burns effect  It'll really make  Your home movies  And photographs  That much more exciting  Yeah just like  What Ken Burns does  To watch  Does it make your voice  Do they have an app  For like making your voice  More like  Sound like a voice over guy  Yeah like Al Holbrook  Whoever they got to do those things  I gotta interrupt  They might have  David Tell's show  Out there already  Bill in North Carolina 
[02:02:30]  Bill  Hey guys  There is an urban fishing show  It's with a  A pro bass fisherman  He has a show called  I think it's called  City Limits Fishing  His name is Mike Iaconelli  He just really  Sounds Italian  Yeah he's a real weird dude  He's a white guy  But he dresses in hip hop gear  Yeah  Real loud and boisterous  Yeah but is he  No we gotta get a brother out there  That's a good call though  But we gotta get a brother out there  Is he putting hooks  In the Hudson River  To see what comes up  There is a brother  That fishes too  His name is Ish  Yeah but they're getting real fish  David Tell's idea is great 
[02:03:00]  Because you never know  What the fuck  You're gonna hook into  You don't know what you're dredging up  But you know what  I like what he said  Your man was on point  Because it is like  This guy takes it to a different level  Like Swamp People  Do you watch that?  Yeah  I think that's cool  Because they have like  A certain limit of gators  That they can do  And then they sell their gator rights  Like they'll get a call  Like in the trailer  Like you'll never guess what  What  And like they don't want to do it  But it's like  We got another 50 gators  We can guess  Like  Aww  And then they start thinking  About all the cool things  They're gonna buy  You know  We can go see 
[02:03:30]  You know  Billy Ray Cyrus  And we can go  Like all the  You see the wheels turning  Alright we'll do it  You really do see  A huge cross section  Of the United States  In a lot of these shows  Because you watch  Something like that  Or that exterminator guy  Oh what happened to that show  That was great  Yeah  The guy just runs around  Fucking grabbing skunks  By their ass glands  And fucking  He doesn't even care  Doesn't give a shit  No  Bees  He's just taking an axe  To the side of a house  That is infested with bees  I love that  That's great  You see that's like  A real man  Billy the exterminator 
[02:04:00]  Yeah  But the best show  I would say  And I'll  State right now  Is the dog whisperer  Because that guy  Gets results  He really gets shit done  He does  He really does like  Change the world  He taps the little dog  On the head  People are in like  A horrible situation  They got this dog  That is not being  You know  That is not  Help  You know  He's not a good dog  And then it turns out  It's always the people  But he like  Comes in there  And somehow he does  I think  I think they replaced the dogs  What do you think  He was like  All right  Okay we got these  Especially cool dogs 
[02:04:30]  Wait a minute  I had a fucking  Doberman  This is a  Bichon  What happened  Yeah because  I saw one the other day  Where this dog  Was one of the nastiest  Fucking things  Like if you got near it  A little one  A big one  It was a little like  Fucking white  Poodley looking thing  But it would be like  I love that  Just like charge at you  If you came near it  It's toys or it's food  And he just does that thing  Where he kind of just  Holds his head down  And goes  Yeah  And then the dog's like  Oh I'm fine  Fuck you  Fuck you  This guy scares the piss out of me 
[02:05:00]  Wow  And the owners just must be  Inept  They just have to be dumb  To not be able to train their dog  They're in a horrible situation  But it looks easy  But it looks easy when he does it  I know  But he's got like some  You know like  X-Man ability  With dogs  You know he's like  Able to control  The one animal  That we  You know  Yeah it is magic  I think  He's got like a special power  Like no one else could do it  But back to Mark Twain  Now Mark Twain  Yes  Let's hear about  Was the first American comic  Okay  Ever  That's what everybody says  He's the 
[02:05:30]  They have the Mark Twain award  Which I will never even  Be allowed in the lobby  Of that  Really  He's like the ultimate comic  He toured  The way like me and Jim  And all these other comics  That come in there  But think about it  Steamboats  Locomotors  Trollies  Like every type of like  Thing you do  When you're wasted on vacation  That was like  I have to catch  The 415 trolley  Or I'll never make  His gig over at Town Hall  Oh no  The schooner  Was sunk  I guess 
[02:06:00]  He's the only comic  So he's up against nobody  Who is his archenemy  Houdini  Who would you go see  If you had one gold piece  In your pocket  In your  Huck Finn  Whatever  In your  In your stick  With a do-rag on it  If you had one gold piece  Who would you rather go see  Twain  Mr.  I had a watermelon  And I blabla  Blabba  Or  Upside down  In a tank  Crazy  You know  I might die  Yeah  Houdini  I'm not sure 
[02:06:30]  If they both were alive  At the same time  But  I think one was born  As one died  But I'd rather see  A baby Houdini  Escape from his mother's snatch  Than Mark Twain  Yeah  I'm just trying to say  Magic beats comedy  Every time  Which leads us to  The latest comedian  Which is Larry King  See we bring it right back  To the beginning  Perfect  Perfect  Dressed like that  He looks like  Fucking John Wilkes Booth  Although everyone did  Back then  Does he talk about Twain?  Yeah  I mean  Wasn't that his first guest?  Mark Twain  Is here with me  Live 
[02:07:00]  We're taking your telegraph  Dot dots and dash dashes  To Mark Twain  That would be hilarious  What is it?  We're cancelled  But I was looking forward  To Baltimore  I'm sorry about that  Baba Booey we just got  So Larry King  Is he going to go on the road  Or what is he going to do?  I don't know  He was on Jade last night  And we got his first stand up here  Let's hear it  A little taste  I know you want to do some stand up  Yeah  Okay  Let me  By the way  When I go out

[02:08:30]  Its trek to Chicago  In a little while  The man leans over  He says  Miss  Holy shit  Miss could I borrow a blanket  And she says  You know  We've never met before  Oh my god  We're two strangers  On a train  You and I  And after tomorrow  We'll never see each other again  So how about  Just for tonight  How about we play  Man and wife  You and me  All night on the train  Man and wife  Guy says

You're pulling the other way  Oh you're pulling the other way  Because I'm so old  See it's still going on  It's never going to end  Is it cold outside Dave?  It's so cold  That no one can think of a cold joke  That's cold  Yeah it's getting really  It's getting down there  But it's not snowing  Does it suck to smoke  When it's this cold outside? 
[02:43:00]  It really is commitment  It's commitment right?  I found when I was smoking  Smoking in the cold  Not as enjoyable  As smoking in the water  Wouldn't that make you  Not smoke as much?  No and it would give me the hiccups  From smoking?  Yeah if it was cold out  And I'd take a drag  And the warmth from the smoke  Hits like the cold of the air  Or something with the diaphragm  And then I'd start getting the hiccups  And it would ruin it  Because every drag I took  I'd hiccup  And it'd fuck that up  And then also  I don't like smoking at the beach  I never liked smoking at the beach  It would be some weird fucking  Weird different taste and feel 
[02:43:30]  Of smoking at the beach  Smoked all that salt  And then the wind would make  The cherry end of the thing  Go way in the cigarette paper  And I don't know  Just it wasn't as good  I liked always smoking  Like in a bar  Bar  Beer  Fucking  Perfect  Just hanging out  No more  Like that  Those days are gone  Gone  At least we can remember them though  Right?  But what do you think of the whole  Putting the pictures of the people  Dying on the cigarettes  Do you think that'll  It's not going to do anything  Just like they said  It won't do shit  I remember the 
[02:44:00]  The first one I remember  Was the surgeon  Not even  It said cigarette smoking  May be hazardous to your health  That was the first one  I remember as a kid  Yeah  And then it was  The surgeon general  Has determined that  Cigarette smoking may be  Hazardous to your health  And then it was  It is hazardous  Yes it is  Now they got the cancer  Now it's just saying  You will die  The birth weight  The fucking  You're dead  Right  And now they're going to  Start putting pictures  Right  Because they do that in Canada  Just shows you  Advertising doesn't work  Canada has pictures  Of like rotting lungs  Mmhmm  And then there's another one though  That has a stroke brain 
[02:44:30]  Mmhmm  There's another one though  That has teeth  They have like teeth  Bad teeth  And the funny thing  That Canadians do  And it's a scream  It's a hoot  A humdinger  You take the cigarette pack  And hold it up to your mouth  And it looks like  Those are your wacky teeth  It's like a game  You want to buy  That pack of cigarettes  Just to make your friends laugh  Sounds like a good app  Right  That would be a good app  Now should they do that  With other like  Let's say junk food  Should they put like  A fat guy at home alone  On a Friday  On the side of that  They should put that on  On chips  That would be nice  On a thing of chips 
[02:45:00]  With like just  Iraq could get a second job  On the bag of chips  Well they got the soda tax now  Thank God  That's the one  And if you hold that cigarette pack  Up to your face  It looks really funny  Looks like your teeth  And Canadians will  Laugh and laugh and laugh  That's what they do  But it does  Smoking does give you  That cool laugh  Nothing better than  The smokers laugh  It's a game changer  Well you know  I felt bad about the whole  You know 
[02:45:30]  With the comic coming in  And you know  Doing the  You know  With your guy coming in  And doing the  Because we really did  Put him on the spot  So I felt bad about that  Ah well don't  Oh don't  Okay  That was  That's the whole bit  That was a high point  That really is the whole bit  That was a high point  Of any time he spends  Here at work  Believe me  Then I was thinking  That maybe that's  The future of comedy  Which is just to go up there  And like stand there  And just stand there  And try really hard  Looking like  But Dave he's not  He's not smart enough  To have just one lousy joke  In his back pocket  Knowing we're going to  Call him in every once in a while 
[02:46:00]  To do that bit  Because the whole bit is  If he gets one joke out  Then he's done  Oh I see  So you would think  After all the times  He's done this  He would sneak one lousy  Stupid line in his back pocket  To use  And then he has  His own website  FattyRock.com  He's got a website  That's more important  Than having an actor  These days  That is so rude man  How many pictures  Are we up to  On FattyRock.com  He's really upset  That you just plugged that  Twice by the way  Oh no  He doesn't like that  You popped it up  Yeah  I did it by mistake  I thought  Wow holy shit  Oh my god 
[02:46:30]  Well let's see  Okay each  Each page  Each page  Has one two  Three four  Five six  One two  Eight  Twelve  Sixteen  Sixteen  Multiply that by  Oh right here  It's got a calendar  4152 pictures  Are on FattyRock.com  This is a picture  Of FattyRock  Next to an unhappy sandwich  Obviously the sandwich  Is unhappy  Because FattyRock  Is about to consume it  Is about to eat  That's great  He's a visual comic 
[02:47:00]  He really is  Yeah  He's more of like  A Pee Wee Herman  You know  Right  He needs like  You know  Giant puppets  And stuff  Is there any other  Good ones that have  Popped up recently  We haven't been to  This site in a while  They put him in  All sorts of scenarios  Dave  Here's with Magnum P.I.  He's hanging out on Hawaii  In Hawaii there  With Tom Selleck  Yeah  I like that one  Waterfall  That's a good one  How cool was that guy  Okay  Tom Selleck  The coolest  It was Christopher Reeve  And he  Even though he's paralyzed  He's laughing  Saying ha ha  You're fat  You're fat  And he rocks 
[02:47:30]  So they get very creative  With their phone shopping  Very creative  Extremely creative  So let me ask you guys  For the holidays  Are you guys going to do  You know  Stick close to home  What do you guys like  You know  I like to call it  What the kids are calling  Staycation  Oh I see  Doing the staycation  Is your holiday done Dave  The Jews  Yeah  Yeah you're done  That Hanukkah man  That moves around  That moves around  Quicker than  Illegal in Arizona  You never know  When it's coming at you 
[02:48:00]  But yeah  It's been over  For a few weeks now  So it really is  Kind of depressing  To be a Hebrew  This time of year  It really is  When they coincide  With each other  You almost feel like  You're sharing a moment  Together  The Jews and the Gentile  You guys had it  After Thanksgiving  We're kind of the Robin  To your Batman  Yeah yeah yeah  You know  Merry Christmas  And a happy Hanukkah  By the way  Happy Hanukkah  Yeah  I say happy holidays now  And if I notice though  That I'm saying it  To a Jewish person  I feel like I'm just  Rubbing it in  Like it's over  Yeah it's bad  It's not that cool 
[02:48:30]  It's like I still have  A time to enjoy  Yet you are now  All your holidays  Are about suffering  From now until  I guess  Absolutely yeah  Toning and suffering  When's the next fun one  For the Jews  I guess Sukkah  Would be a big one  That's celebrating the harvest  Because you know  Jews were farmers  Okay  And we're always out  In the fields  So it's time to  Roll up your sleeves  And you know  Sit at the big table  And eat the bounty  Passover is just  A brutal holiday  For the Jewish people 
[02:49:00]  It doesn't end  And it's just  All about suffering  It's like Monopoly  Without a board  You have no idea  What's going on  There's a lot of reading  Yeah and just  Looking for a way out  I'm not  I don't think I'd like  Bitter herbs  And unleavened bread  Yeah  And things like that  It just doesn't sound  Very appetizing  No way to punch that up  The shank bone  Is always cool  Because you gotta  You know like  There is the shank bone  Yes  For the Jewish listeners  I guess maybe  How many do you think  You have  A couple hundred  Two or three  We got one that calls  From Israel  My account was a lot  That guy can definitely 
[02:49:30]  Back us up  Because he's like  Ten regular Jews  If he lives in Israel  In Israel  Maybe he could call today  He sounds very Jewish  Okay because the shank bone  Is like a very important  Part of the satyr plate  And you gotta  You keep it in your refrigerator  Like it's a CSI thing  You know so it's like  Right next to  It's like evidence  Right next to ice cream  You know  It's like  What is that  That's a bone  And what is the  Why do you have to  Save the shank bone  Shank bone  What is the  It's part of the  Everything's supposed to  You know  Symbolize the suffering  Of the  Of the 
[02:50:00]  I don't know  I'm not really  Into the  I have not a real idea  But you're right  With the better herbs  And all that kind of stuff  And the horseradish  And you know  The nose jobs  At the end  Jesus suffered a lot  But we don't celebrate  His suffering as much  Well  You never stop talking about it  That's for sure  That is  We should let it go  At this point  But we did kind of  Turn it into a fun  Little celebratory thing  You really did  We made it very festive  His suffering  I mean  Maybe you guys should do that  The Pope who  I guess  You know  Knows him 
[02:50:30]  Right  Personally yeah  He said condoms are in  Which is kind of cool  Because I like the church  They're always like  A hundred years behind everybody  Yeah then they just start  Coming around saying  Condom  In certain circumstances  Yeah  It's like  You know  The zipper  Alright  You can you know  We're into zipper  You don't need a button  On your shoe  Fast access  I'm learning that  We don't like  I'm learning that  Purim is coming up  For you guys  Oh that's a good one  Which one is that  That's a non-dreadle holiday  So there will be no  Dreadling  No spinning  Purim I believe  Is where you eat 
[02:51:00]  The honey and apples  That's you know  They're all food related  Yeah everything is food related  Purim I think  It was another one of us  Like a Jewish holiday  Is a lot of close calls  You know  It's like  They almost got us  But we got away  You know  There's actually one holiday  Literally called  Yeah  They can't even jazz up  An apple  Pack and get out  Don't wait for the bread  To rise  And get the heck  Out of here  Why not peanut butter  And apples  Why does it have to be  Honey and apples  Because we're celebrating  Judaism not getting high 
[02:51:30]  That's good  Yeah really  That's breaking into  The pot religion  Alright good point sir  Good point  I live amongst the Jews  My house is amongst the Jews  Which I love as neighbors  They're great  We don't decorate  Like you guys do  For the holidays  No  See that  But it makes  It makes Chinese food delivery  So much easier now  Oh yeah yeah yeah  Because I try to get my address  And I'm like blah blah  And they can never get the name  Of the street right  And stuff  And I go  Yeah that's the street  Okay  It's the only house  On the block 
[02:52:00]  With Christmas lights  And they're like oh okay  And then they just know  They drive down this  Pitch black road  And then there's just this  Catholic fucking  They just hear  Oh  Oasis  This oasis of Catholicism  In the middle of Judaism  Yeah  It's wonderful  Like the pork fried rice  Was in the giveaway  Let me get some extra pork  In that pork fried rice  Fried rice  And  But you know  The holidays is for everybody  Basically  It really is  Especially nowadays  We're all just  Trying to hold the line  And you know  The terrorists 
[02:52:30]  This is like their time  Where they're thinking  They're going to get us  You know what I'm saying  They like using this against us  They got us one  They think we have a guard down  Well underwear bomber guy  Was last year  That was last Christmas  And this Christmas  Now I'm hearing  Look out for your salad bars  Really  And your buffets  Anywhere where there's open food  Because they're making poison  And they're going to sprinkle  And they're going to sprinkle poison  On various locations of salad bars  And where you know  Your soup  Where you open up the lid 
[02:53:00]  And you pour your own soup out  Oh no  Do we need buffets  Do we really need the salad bar people  Walking around  No that's what I was thinking  I was like  I never go to a buffet  So fuck them  You're crazy to eat at a salad bar  I don't even like when people like  They use different tongs  What about like at a hotel  Like when you get the free continental breakfast  Like are they going to take down  Our continental breakfast  I know  If then they truly have won  They're going to take out our waffles  That's the most important meal of the day  And if they take it out  Yeah  And butter that you can't smear on it very easily  Because it's freezing cold 
[02:53:30]  Well we can all agree  The days of mailing a you know  Printer cartridge from Yemen are over  I mean you know  I can't tell you how many times  I've been working on a screenplay  Or some jokes  And I'm like  Damn I'm out of toner  Let me get on my friend  Blah blah blah  Who lives in  A desert  Nomadic  Tent somewhere  At the Staples  Yemen does have  Some of the best quality printer  They do  That's what I hear  Now that's all over  It's over  We have to take another break  Why? 
[02:54:00]  Are we ready?  Yeah because we got  They gave us like  80 live reads  I want to apologize  To our listeners  We didn't do this  Especially for 15 years  Of mediocre radio  They did it to us  We got what  15 live reads today  So we have to actually  Take a break  Just so we can read some stuff  I know  I should actually get my diploma  That I didn't get in high school  For all the reading that I do now  Can't this count as a credit to high school?  Yeah you should prove that you did well  In high school  I should call John H. Glenn  High school in Elwood  And tell them  Look  Look bastards  I read 
[02:54:30]  Look at me now  We'll try to do a quick break  Do some live reads  And we'll be right back to end the show  Stay there  This is the Opie and Anthony show  Serious XM  It's for you David Tell  Oh god  Take a look at the screen  Look at this mess  The Christmas song of the year right here  That dance is great  Yeah  But I'm kind of perplexed by that camel tail 
[02:55:00]  Yeah exactly  I'm not really sure what's going on down there yet  Wait till you hear the words  Vagina vagina  Vagina vagina  Christmas pussy pussy  Vagina vagina  Christmas pussy pussy  Vagina vagina  Christmas pussy pussy  Some tells me it's Christmas penis under there  Call me silly. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  Here's the hook.  There you go.  For you, Dave.  Father Christmas, fuck my pussy.  Yeah.  And then back to the dance.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, you'll be helping us later, Dave. 
[02:56:00]  Well, it's good to see Fantasia is still out there cutting it up.  So what do you think?  Is that a dude?  I'd say that's a dude, but the picture on the wall of the graduation is really the creepiest part of the whole thing.  There were dreams.  There were hopes.  And it's just gone now.  And dip it in in my cunt.  Oh, okay. 
[02:56:30]  She's English or something, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Something going on.  Well, you got to give it to her because, you know, with that royal marriage in the air, everybody's a little excited.  In my cunt, your majesty.  It's going to be in 3D, that royal marriage.  Just one of the commoners doing a shout-out to their king and queen.  That royal family boy shit.  Fuck that.  You're going to watch the 3D wedding in? 
[02:57:00]  No.  Is it going to be 3D?  That's the big sell.  Oh.  First Avatar, now the royal wedding in 3D.  Now, what are they going to do it?  On TV?  Yeah, I guess.  You got to get your 3D TV.  Everyone's got to get their 3D television for this big extravaganza.  You don't even have one, right?  No.  You don't have a 3D TV, do you, Dave?  Yeah, I have a window.  That's all I need there.  I just went bigger in the living room, though.  Yeah?  I went to a 60.  Wow.  60.  Whoa.  Because, yeah, I was feeling it, but... 
[02:57:30]  It's officially a 63, isn't it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got the 63.  It's a nice size.  I just need something a little bigger, because if I want real big, I'll just go downstairs to  the movie theater.  Mmm.  I got one of those in the house.  David Tell.  Just perked up.  Me a bag of shells.  Radio money.  Easy come, easy go, Norton.  I had it, and I went with it.  Can you imagine what we just watched in gigantic 63-inch? 
[02:58:00]  Yes.  Or on an 11-foot-wide movie screen.  Tell me you wouldn't shoot that if you were coming downstairs after a Jack Daniels.  I would absolutely shoot that.  I would shoot that sober.  Christmas, fuck my pussy.  It's finally what Christmas is all about.  Is this motherfucker still getting press?  Jimmy McMillan.  Jimmy McMillan.  We had one of the first interviews with him, and now he's a big star.  He's got action figures.  Wow.  I think he's got songs and everything.  Oh, he's got a guitar. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, what the fuck?  He's got a guitar.  Is he doing Times Square?  Is he the new naked cowboy?  Is he getting sued?  Wow.  Singer political activist.  Now, how does he get...  Who's his barber?  Does he have to go back in time to find a guy who can do...  Give me something that makes me look like I can make a puppet out of chocolate.  I'm looking for the Frederick Douglass.  Yes, please.  I want something that'll really fit in on the Underground Railroad.  I've got a big abolitionist fundraiser I'm talking to.  I'm going to...  Something that'll look at if I watch Glory. 
[02:59:00]  People.  Frederick Douglass.  He really does have an old school black guy grooming do there.  What I love about this guy, he said, fuck politics, because he discovered fame.  He don't give a shit about anyone anymore.  Does that haircut come with a hot air balloon?  Going around the world.  I think this is him going to perform.  Yeah.  Maybe not.  Maybe they don't have it set up for us today. 
[02:59:30]  Oh, it's good.  It's my place of yours.  This is Jimmy McMillan.  Jimmy McMillan.  I think this is a Peter Gabriel cut.  Is he talking about fixing the budget?  I think so.  Yeah, yeah.  Something about the rent. 
[03:00:00]  Now he's picking up his action figure.  Boy, is he just a shill.  Do you want me to close up?  Do you want me to close up?  I'm ready.  Do you want me to turn out the light?  Do you want me to close up?  He sucks.  He's on the news right now.  Get the mood right.  Do you want me to close up?  This is great.  Whatever happened to him worrying about the common man?  His rent is too damn hot.  It looks like he could be shucking, though, a little.  Like, he should do some soft shoe. 
[03:00:30]  My place of yours.  Even his clothes match the hair.  My place of yours.  This reminds me.  Remember the Joe Franklin show?  Yes.  This kind of reminds me of that.  Like, you know, it looks like, who would you not want to see at this hour?  Oh.  A guy who ran for whatever.  And that was the singing.  We catch you. 
[03:01:00]  The rent's too high.  It didn't really pan out.  Shoehorn in that Christmas angle, huh?  Better than sleeves.  Santa Claus got evicted because he couldn't pay his rent.  Oh, shit, no!  Sleeping in the park.  Oh.  Santa Claus is on a park bench?  He's home.  Your rent's going up.  What you gonna do? 
[03:01:30]  Pay it?  If you can't pay.  Oh.  You're gonna be out there, too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Tell him about it.  This is so racial.  It really is.  I mean, like, honestly.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Who should be, like, yelling at a giant bagel?  My rent's too high.  Too high.  What are you doing to me, bagel man?  We all know why the rent's too high.  Everybody say it.  Everybody say it with me.  The Jew.  They're trying to cut them off.  The whitest people.  The rent is too damn high.  Oh. 
[03:02:00]  They're getting in on it.  It is the holidays.  Holy on good day, New York.  Rent too high.  We obviously did not look at the lyrics.  No, we didn't.  Oh.  What are they apologizing for?  He's right.  Stay tuned for Wendy Williams.  We will see you tomorrow.  Jimmy, sing a sound.  Oh, was it the sexual innuendo of the beginning of that song?  Wait, what part?  When he was talking about, you know, let's do it in the kitchen.  We can do it in the kitchen.  We can do it in the kitchen.  We can handle that on TV.  Apparently, they didn't look at the lyrics beforehand. 
[03:02:30]  Why didn't vote for him?  What, they have the same producer as our show?  Yeah, what the fuck?  Exactly.  Oh, wait a minute.  The lawyer has got to run by the lyrics.  I'll vote for him now.  I didn't know he was a double threat like that.  And actually, we want to apologize for any children watching that think Santa is homeless  and are crying right now.  He's not on a park bench.  He's in the North Pole.  Making your toys, kids.  Yes, he's making toys.  He can pay the rent because he doesn't have an evil Jewish landlord like the black man does.  With their shank bone.  Their shank bone. 
[03:03:00]  Their magical shank bone.  The magic thermostat that never goes up.  The boiler that never lights.  He really should have been like, there should have been noses, like giant noses.  Just old 30s Nazi propaganda posters.  Just dancing.  What are you doing to me?  Dancing Jew noses in the background.  Yeah, you know why the rent's too high?  We started the show with Brett Favre.  We end with Brett Favre.  Why is he still playing?  What's wrong with this guy?  Yeah, how's his knee or whatever? 
[03:03:30]  Knee?  Now he's got to worry about his head.  Well, you can't see his head hit because they put the graphic in front of it.  Yeah.  These people are as...  Oh, no.  And then he's just laying there, like twitching.  He was playing last night with a dead hand.  I don't know why.  I don't know what he's trying to prove.  No, I'm serious.  Dead hand.  It was blue.  Oh, that's great.  That dude is...  Oh, my God.  Like, he's doing this for a team that is way out of it.  Enough, dude.  What are you doing?  Retire.  Enjoy what little health you have left.  Did they amputate his arm?  Okay, there it is.  I thought...  Oh, you'll see it.  It's blue. 
[03:04:00]  Oh, God.  Yeah, he's in horrible shape.  How old is he?  40, something.  40, 41, somewhere in there.  He's early 40s.  40, whatever it is to be too old to be a quarterback.  I think it's a...  Wow.  Is that a Honus Wagner?  Yeah, CNN's showing a Honus Wagner baseball card.  Why are they showing that?  A baseball card.  They sold it again.  Buy or sniffs none.  Sniffs, yeah.  Sniffs, yeah.  Or sniffs.  I don't know.  Sniffs works better.  Ponies up the cash.  Oh, somebody probably bought a Honus Wagner card off a bunch of nuns for a really cheap 
[03:04:30]  price.  Oh, boy.  And a cardiologist came up with the cash.  Yeah, because they got stiffed.  I'm speculating on literally eight words of...  That sounds about right.  That was like in the storage bin.  Somebody just found that card.  Yes.  That's what you're hoping if there's a whatever card.  Yeah, yeah.  You're hoping for that card and you open it up and you get old fucking Ikea furniture  and...  That's the...  Wallpaper.  The most expensive baseball card.  ...type paper.  But there are too many of those...  Fantasia.  Oh, shit. 
[03:05:00]  I'm popping up.  She looks good.  Oh, man.  Would you?  My rent's too high.  My rent's too high.  Oh, it's the Wendy Williams show.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  It must be the Jew.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  My rent is due.  I pay the Jew.  He should have all the abused minorities come out.  Am I right, my red brother?  Yes, yeah.  Uh-huh.  My teepee's too...  Teepee's rent is too high.  Right, igloo men?  Yeah.  I can't afford no bear hide to build a new teepee. 
[03:05:30]  Wendy, I really do like him.  You know, she's been going through a lot of drama recently, including a suicide attempt,  and we'll talk to her about that.  But she's come out on top.  She's alive.  She's well.  She's got a number one album, and she's going to perform a single from that album today.  So Fantasia's here.  It's another fake suicide, though.  Yeah.  It wasn't a real one.  What'd she do?  It was a pill?  Stop it.  That's fake suicide.  Pills are a cry for help.  Angie Everhart is here. 
[03:06:00]  Standing in front of a train, isn't it?  Pills are Hollywood.  Yeah.  Very Hollywood.  You know, the deal with Angie is that...  Especially the phone call on the pills.  Oh, fine.  I just took a bunch of pills, and I don't know how many of it they were.  I mean, I just want to die.  Yeah.  All right.  What kind of pills are they?  I don't know.  It's prescription, and I just...  It's been so lonely and depressing.  All right.  Cry for help.  Cry for help. 
[03:06:30]  There's a knife there.  Plunge it into your chest.  That's not a cry for help.  And then try to make a phone call.  That's not a cry for help.  A gun to your head.  Yes.  Zero cry for help.  I'm passed out by the gun rack.  The hollow points.  I OD'd.  I'll be on the floor when you come in next to the knives.  And it's the weekend.  And the guns.  I have anything planned.  I'll be socializing tomorrow.  What are we doing tonight?  Oh, fashion night out.  All right.  All right.  I don't know for that shit.  If that doesn't say, let's get the fuck out of here. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, why don't we leave?  David Teller was terrific.  Yes, Dave.  Always a pleasure.  Guys, thanks for having me in, man.  Please.  Stop being a stranger.  We love you.  Have you in.  We love the David Teller.  He's got to do the show more.  Can I say happy holiday to all the people who are coming to the shows, all the people  who have come to the shows this year?  And since it is the end of the year, we did lose Greg Giraldo and Robert Schimmel, two  of the greatest comics ever.  So, you know, if you feel like it, please check out their sites and go donate.  They both left behind a lot of kids, a lot of family.  So, if you got it in your heart for it, we'd appreciate it because the people who appreciate 
[03:07:30]  comedy know these guys are great.  Yeah, absolutely, man.  Absolutely.  Sorry for a low note.  Nah, that's a goal.  That shit works this time of year.  And we love both those guys.  Both did our show over the years.  They're both cool, dude.  David Tell, December 26th through the 30th at Caroline's.  Make sure you check that out.  And then he's playing the big show with Norton and Brewer and Bill Burr at the Bregada.  That's a cage match.  I can't fucking wait.  We're all going down for the weekend to check that shit out.  Oh, man.  Am I going to tank?  I am going to tank.  Dude, I owe you an apology. 
[03:08:00]  I'm going to fucking destroy.  And I think that's it.  You got a Twitter?  Come on now.  I'm an old man.  You don't do the Twitter?  No, I'm good.  The Twitter?  I'm good.  All right.  Then he's good.  We're going to leave you guys today with another Kevin Bloody Wilson Christmas song.  Sweet.  Magic.  Supposedly, this guy's huge in Australia.  We never heard of him in the States.  Well, of course.  They're 10 years ahead.  A comic yesterday turned us on to him.  So we're going to do one more from him as we say goodbye and we'll see you guys tomorrow.  Ho, ho, fucking ho. 
[03:08:30]  What a crock of shit.  We all work for Santa Claus.  We've had enough.  We quit.  Because we do all the fucking work while he stars in the show.  Stick your Christmas up your arse.  Ho, ho, fucking ho.  I'm Rudolph and I quit.  Just who's he think he is.  That little fat cunt sat back in the sleigh cracking that fucking whip.  And me stuck up the front of these other useless cunts. 
[03:09:00]  Stick your Christmas up your arse.  Ho, ho, fucking ho.  Ho, ho, fucking ho.  What a crock of shit.  We all work for Santa Claus.  We're bad enough.  We quit.  Because we do all the fucking work while he stars in the show.  Stick your Christmas up your arse.  Ho, ho, fucking ho.  And what about us elves?  We've had enough as well.  Working in that freezing factory cold as fucking hell. 
[03:09:30]  Work until we drop with our bollocks freezing off.  Stick your Christmas up your arse.  Ho, ho, fucking ho.  Ho, ho, fucking ho.  What a crock of shit.  We all work for Santa Claus.  We're bad enough.  We quit.  Because we do all the fucking work while he stars in the show.  Stick your Christmas up your arse.  Ho, ho, fucking ho.  I'm Santa Claus's wife. 
[03:10:00]  I know what he's really like.  Sneaking into them little kids' rooms.  He's a fucking pedophile.  A devious old drunk.  And I'm married to the cunt.  So stick your Christmas up your arse.  Ho, ho, fucking ho.  Ho, ho, fucking ho.  What a crock of shit.  We all work for Santa Claus.  We're bad enough.  We quit.  Because we do all the fucking work while he stars in the show. 
[03:10:30]  Stick your Christmas up your arse.  Ho, ho, fucking ho.  Stick your Christmas up your arse.  Ho, ho, fucking ho.  Stick your Christmas up your arse.  Ho, ho, fucking ho.  Ho, ho, fucking ho. </pre>
