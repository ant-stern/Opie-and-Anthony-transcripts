<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast on Monday, February 19th, 2007, opened with the usual playful banter and crude humor from Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  A major topic was Britney Spears' recent head-shaving incident, with speculation ranging from a mental breakdown to a publicity stunt designed to eclipse Paris Hilton.  The hosts discussed the possibility of a listener head-shaving contest in solidarity and engaged in graphic, offensive descriptions of Spears' physical appearance before and after the event, using comparisons to cheap chicken and concentration camp victims. Technical difficulties with the show's audio and communication systems were also acknowledged.

The conversation shifted to a mummified man found dead in his home after over a year, prompting shock, humor, and morbid fascination about the circumstances and what he was watching on TV.  Graphic descriptions of his state were given.  The Daytona 500 and its numerous crashes were also discussed.  The hosts shared anecdotes from their weekend, including a Valentine's Day dinner featuring a couple who continuously insulted each other.  The "Convertible Boy" song and differing opinions on "March of the Penguins" were also mentioned. One host mentioned sleeping in his car after a show.

The show featured a segment on "No Filter Paul," a prankster known for disrupting live news reports with large signs, including an incident involving Sue Simmons.  Audio and video clips were played.  This transitioned into a discussion about the rape of elderly women in a retirement community, featuring graphic details and insensitive comments from the hosts.  They then discussed a 15-year-old girl with chronic hiccups, questioning the condition's legitimacy. A photo taken by E-Rock in the studio bathroom, showing a lack of toilet paper left by a host, was a source of comedic discussion.  "Convertible Boy," a song described as "gay," written by guest Robert Kelly, and its listener remixes were played and discussed, with listeners encouraged to submit their own.

A further segment focused on "Convertible Boy," initially described as poorly written but potentially funny.  This led to a segment featuring Corinne, a listener who requested an on-air spanking by a staff member. E-Rock's attempt resulted in a hard hit, causing apparent injury to Corinne and provoking outrage.  The hosts then discussed a local news story about a deaf Long Island sex offender who went on a groping spree, finding humor in the situation.  Tangents included local grocery stores and the hosts' "perv switches." A listener called in describing a near "perv switch" moment, and the show concluded with Corinne receiving another (awkward and forceful) spanking by E-Rock, along with plugs for upcoming events.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Shut up! Shut up!  No!  Shut up!  Opie, I'm stumped because I'm a shapely European blonde.  Anthony, Jesus, we are just whores.  James Norton, look at his face, how do you not love it and want to kiss it?  You rock.  Sex Vagel here on the radio with you.  Sex Vagel. 
[00:00:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  And Sex Vagel gets hit with poker chips.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  I was only joking.  I was only joking.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba.  I was only joking.  I was only joking.  I was only joking.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy.  Yeah.  Good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi.  Monday, February 19th, 2007.  You might have the day off.  You might have this president's day off.  But we're here for you.  The schmucks in the know.  To get your commute.  Oh, that's right.  You're not commuting.  Yeah.  You're home in bed.  Oh, well, the alarm went off.  Oh, that's right.  They didn't set the alarm because they didn't have to get up for work. 
[00:01:30]  The schmucks in the know thought it would be a good idea for us to work today.  We thought it would be a good idea to take the day off and maybe recharge a little bit.  Sleep in.  Yeah.  Get our heads together.  Stay in Atlantic City another day.  Yeah, you know.  You know.  But the schmucks in the know.  I guess that's why they get the big bucks.  They know better than us.  They know.  They think it's smart to broadcast to nobody.  Ooh, the F is up right now.  Um, nobody.  Usually the phones are lit right at 6 o'clock. 
[00:02:00]  Nothing happening there.  Nah, there's not going to be.  The instant feedback is pretty much at a crawl right now.  I'm trying to get the pal talk up here.  I had to restart.  I had to restart.  But I'm just about there.  Let's see.  Let's go into the room and see who's in.  We got...  There's a few people.  Just a few, huh?  Yeah.  All right, it's the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:02:30]  Of course, the O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  A lot has happened since the last time we talked to you guys.  Has it?  Well, yeah.  Britney Spears is now bald.  She's crazy.  I love Britney Spears now.  That's all they're talking about, too.  See, now I'm back in Britney's camp.  It's going back and forth.  What, you like her now?  Well, I was in Kevin Federline's camp for a while. 
[00:03:00]  But now you've got to give it to Britney.  What is that?  I don't know.  I can hear this show.  I hear this show about a second after you say it.  And I can't hear it on my headphones.  E-Rock, what's going on over there?  Can you hear it like this?  Hold on.  Oh, E-Rock.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  E-Rock.  E-Rock, what are you doing?  It was all E-Rock's fault.  Of course it was.  What are you doing?  The board was in queue over here, so the queue speaker was on it.  And?  For queer? 
[00:03:30]  Because that's where you sit.  And whose responsibility is that?  That would be mine.  Yeah, of course.  Oh, yeah.  Now you need to be punished.  Could you go in that bathroom?  I left something in there.  Go in the bathroom and take your punishment like a lucky devil.  What is it?  John and Jeff audio?  Oh, they stink.  There you go, E-Rock.  There's your punishment.  What do you think?  Good one?  It looks like a wet paper towel, too. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, you left it?  All right.  That's a...  Wow.  Let them figure out what we're talking about in Radio Land.  Is Al working today?  We got to keep it safe.  What do you say, Al?  What do you say, Al?  Of course he is.  So who's up for getting their head shaved to join Team Brittany?  I won't.  You won't shave your head?  Oh, why would I do that?  I think I would shave my head.  Yeah?  Yeah, why not?  It's too cold out.  I think we should get a... 
[00:04:30]  Get a chill.  I think we should get a mass shaving of the heads.  Jimmy's done it.  How many listeners can we get to line up and get their heads shaved to join Team Brittany?  To join that juke?  How many listeners we got?  Huh?  How many listeners we even have today?  Well, I don't know.  Maybe we do it tomorrow or Wednesday.  Maybe we, like, promote it a little bit.  You know what you got to do, though?  What?  You got to...  Unlike Brittany, you got to kind of feel your skull to see if you have a nice-shaped head. 
[00:05:00]  But, like, I'll give it to that stupid bitch, Sinead.  O'Connor.  Sinead O'Connor.  Yeah.  She had a pleasant-looking shaved head.  It was nice and round.  Brittany's is all bumpy.  Looks like she's been hit on the side of the head with, like, a frying pan a few times during her youth.  Her head's not that bad.  Dude, stop.  What's wrong with you?  She has an awful head for the shaved head.  Oh, over here.  Look at that.  She's got a bunch of dings.  She's got a bunch of bumps and dings on the side of her head. 
[00:05:30]  You can't have that if you're going to shave your head.  You can't.  How great is it that she's just nuts?  She went crazy.  But you know what?  She didn't go that crazy, and I'll tell you why.  Why?  This is all we're seeing.  Because she did all this in the eye of the paparazzi.  Yeah, but they're following her.  It's like she can't do anything else besides doing things in the eye of the paparazzi.  She could have done this at home.  Why does she pick, like, a salon where the paparazzi are outside, where the windows are nice,  and they get a nice shot of her going nuts. 
[00:06:00]  That shows how crazy she is that she does it out there.  Absolutely.  Here's a girl.  Think about this.  I gave it a little thought when I read the story.  Here's a girl that just a few short years ago was the hottest girl around.  Everyone was drooling.  I would say hottest girl ever, ever, ever.  Ever, ever, ever.  People were looking at her.  2002.  Ever, ever, ever.  2002.  People were looking, and any time you saw her, it was like, oh, Britney, holy gee.  Remember when she did that HBO special?  Yeah.  And it was a live performance of her concert, and we're all watching, and we're on the phone 
[00:06:30]  with each other, and it's like, oh, my God, did you just see that?  She's in a tub, and she's doing some tub scene.  And we didn't really know the music of Britney.  No, who cared about the music?  She was taking showers on stage.  She was doing, like, a strip club act.  Yeah.  And it was fantastic, and she was so hot, and then when she got pregnant, we said, uh-oh,  she's got that kind of body that's very hard to snap back from.  You got to be like an anorexic, and then you get pregnant, and then you lose all the  weight. 
[00:07:00]  But she had a little trouble, and then the other kid, and the Kevin Federline thing, and  her just shoving food in her mouth, and the stupid reality show, we started all turning  on her, and now they're just showing her, and all they show now isn't hot, Britney.  They show, look at this fat thigh.  Look at the fat belly over her pants.  And she went out and hung out with Paris Hilton to try to, like, boost her sexy image, and  all it did was make the press goof on her.  So you go from this hot chick, and you got to think from that chick in that chick head, 
[00:07:30]  that chick point of view, they don't like that at all.  So she's sitting there.  She was the hottest thing ever.  Now, anytime you see her, it's fat Britney.  Britney's a kook.  Britney's unattractive.  This one's so much hotter.  It drove her nuts.  She went completely over the edge, shaved her head, not even well.  It was like concentration camp shaving.  There were little pieces, like a chicken.  You ever get good chicken?  Yeah.  Like Purdue or something.  And it's all nice, the skin. 
[00:08:00]  And then you get the cheap chicken.  You get wall bales.  Yeah, you get, and there's, like, little hairs on it.  That's what her head looked like.  Yeah.  Cheap chicken.  Cheap chicken.  She has cheap chicken head.  Yeah.  Cheap chicken from where?  Wall bales.  Wall bales.  I like going to King Cullen.  Keep it local for Long Island.  Wall bales.  King Cullen.  Wall bales.  Who's Cullen, and when was he knighted?  I don't remember King Cullen. 
[00:08:30]  You know she probably had some psycho laugh going on as she's shaving her head.  Yeah, they have pictures of her.  She walked into a beauty salon.  Yeah, well, there's Esther.  Esther Tugnazzi.  Esther, good old Esther.  She runs this, like, just awful salon in the middle of nowhere.  Yeah.  Now she's, like, a huge star.  She walked in.  By the way, the hair?  Yeah.  They had to take it off eBay because everyone's claiming they got the hair.  Bid's up to $1 million for Britney's hair.  Yeah.  And eBay said, you know what?  We got to take this off. 
[00:09:00]  I heard it yesterday.  It was up to $11.  And then when they did the press, the story got on the news.  Yeah.  It went up to $1 million.  And no one's paying it.  It's like a goof bid.  There she is.  So she's in the salon, and her beauty consultant, the woman that usually does her hair, refused  to do it.  So Britney picked up the clippers and did it herself, and shaved her head herself with  the clippers, laughing like a nut the whole time.  Yeah. 
[00:09:30]  You just know it's just out of her mind.  All kooky.  Now they're showing some old footage of her.  See, and this is the stuff I'm talking about.  You know what?  I got another theory on this, too.  You know, young Hollywood, the starlets, they're all trying to, you know, out-shock each  other.  Out-control.  Out-out-of-control, the other one.  Where Paris Hilton invented the oopsie, as in, I'm not purposely showing you my you-know-what,  but oops, here it is.  I'm just getting out of my limo.  And oh, I don't have any panties on.  She invented the oopsie. 
[00:10:00]  And I think all these girls in Hollywood, these, like, Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton  and Britney joined them.  They're all trying to shock each other.  And Britney's like, all right, this is what I'm going to do now.  Here we go.  Now it's in my head.  Paris Hilton is not going to do anything as crazy as this.  The play is now to you.  The nutty whore play?  Right.  It's now to you.  What do you do?  I think that has something to do with it, too.  They've been trying to out-shock each other.  And people are like, well, after you do the old oopsie and show everyone what you got going  on down there, what's next? 
[00:10:30]  They're shock whores.  What's next is to take your femininity away.  Yeah.  So I think there was a little of that going on, too, because the other thing is no one  was really talking about Britney until she started this whole thing with hanging out  with Paris Hilton and doing the oopsie.  Yeah.  And I think last week they got pictures of puke in her limo.  She's puking now and passing out.  And, you know, I think...  Here's what I say the next thing.  I think she's just working the press as well.  Here's how Lindsay Lohan can jump in now and outshine Britney. 
[00:11:00]  Cut her wrist in public.  No, no, not even that.  No?  I'm talking a completely unnecessary double mastectomy.  Both breasts removed for no reason whatsoever.  And carry them in bags over her shoulders like a pioneer girl.  You know what?  Make tobacco pouches out of them.  You know what?  I could trump that.  Really?  I think one is more outrageous.  What?  Doing what?  Oh, just one breath.  Just one. 
[00:11:30]  Wow.  And not even covering it up.  Archery, like an Amazon woman, and say you cut it off so you can pull the bow back further.  And don't even cover it up.  I love it.  Still wear, like, you know, sexy dresses that go off the wand.  Like a bikini top.  Oh, yeah.  But don't try to stuff it.  If you take both, then it looks like you're just flat-chested.  Right.  One breast.  One.  And still wear halter tops.  Halter tops and bikini tops.  Little baby doll.  With one really nice, and then the other one just flat and billowing in the breeze. 
[00:12:00]  And someone's saying, do you guys really think she looks bad?  I think she's pulling it off.  How many other women could do this and still look effable?  That's Coke logic.  I agree with Coke logic.  Yeah, she doesn't look awful.  She doesn't look that bad at all.  She doesn't look awful, but please, she looks better with hair on her head.  And she's got bumpy side of the head bumps.  She got that goddamn Marcellus Wallace head.  What's going on with that?  Oh, she rocks, though, man.  Let's go to Rick in East Northport.  He lives close to a wall. 
[00:12:30]  Or is it King Cullen?  Rick!  Yo!  What's going on?  What up, girls?  How are you?  All right.  All right.  Yo, I was going to say, man, you got to say, you know, she looks terrible.  Well, I mean, she did a hell of a lot better job on her head than she did the other area,  man.  Yeah.  All right.  That's true.  Yeah.  Wait, what happened?  She shaved her head better than she shaved the other area region.  What?  There was problems down there?  Yeah, a little bit going on.  A little bit?  Yeah.  Again, the Purdue.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Horrible.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  See you later, boys.  Let's see how to Pete in New York City.  Pete, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, buddy?  Hey.  Good morning.  Yeah, I'm one of your only...  One of the only listeners out here.  Yeah, I think she looks ridiculous, but you know what?  I'm willing to shave my head, man.  I'll be the first one on the list to shave my head.  This is what I'm thinking.  I'm thinking we get a mass head shaving going on, and we start a team called Team Brittany.  Team Brittany.  Team Brittany, man. 
[00:13:30]  I'm back at Brittany's camp.  I hated Kevin Federline, and then Jimmy turned me on to Kevin Federline.  I'm like, yeah, this guy's all right after all.  And then the Super Bowl commercial, you know, goofing on himself.  But now, what is Kevin going to do?  Because now I'm back with Brittany.  Team Brittany, I say.  K-Fed wrecked the hottest sex symbol in the last one.  Yeah.  He destroyed her.  I think we email her, and we have her come in to do everyone's shaving.  Hey, Pete.  Going on down there.  Keep listening to the show.  We're going to try to figure out if we're going to do this mass head shaving thing, all right? 
[00:14:00]  We're looking at before she shaved her head.  The oopsie.  The oopsie picture, we'll call it.  Yeah, the oopsie picture.  And it was shaved.  Yeah.  And what I'm seeing is the portion, the very small portion that is what you would call ground zero is shaved nicely.  But then, if you look at sort of the foundation, the under portion, there's a lot going on there. 
[00:14:30]  What is that?  It looks like someone fell asleep on their side, and they're drooling hair out of the side of their mouth.  And that C-section scar is no help.  She should pull that shirt down a little.  Look, it's so fresh, it's still all red and tender.  She's got a Fred Flintstone mouth.  It is.  Is that or Homer Simpson, yeah.  Well, yeah, a little Homer.  A little Homer.  It's almost like Gaffey Duck.  It looks like an old Hollywood actress with too much collagen in her lips. 
[00:15:00]  Let's go to Michigan.  Reuben, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, Jimmy Norton.  Hi.  Hey, I got one out of Trump obese.  Yeah.  Put one right in the middle.  Can they actually move one to the middle?  Yeah, now you're getting crazy.  Now you're being a goose.  Now it's just silly.  She looks like a concentration camp victim.  I'm sorry.  She looks like, you know, fresh in.  Not in for a few months, you know.  Hasn't lost the weight.  Wearing that star of David, too.  Yeah, she's wearing a big star of David. 
[00:15:30]  And I'll tell you, she's not completely crazy, because now the picture we're looking at,  this is like in the middle of her shaving, where she kind of has the Harry Krishna thing happening.  If she would have walked out of the salon like that, and people would try to clean her up,  and she said, no, this is exactly how we want to walk around, then I would say she's nuts.  But to clean it up and make it look all perfect, bald cap-ish.  I don't know.  If she left some strands like that, then I would say she's completely gone.  And she's got like very dark eye makeup on. 
[00:16:00]  She's got the raccoon eyes going, and she's shaving her head.  This makes no sense.  Well, in the paper, they said that she left rehab and had a fight with her mother.  And this was like a rebellion against Mommy.  Nice.  There's other ways to rebel against Mommy.  Because Mommy wants her to clean up, because Mommy's paychecks are going to stop coming in.  Mommy needs to get paid.  I need to get paid.  And then what happened?  Her former boyfriend there, what's his name? 
[00:16:30]  Kevin Federline.  Nah, nah.  Justin Timberlake?  Justin.  What are we, The View?  Yeah, we're The View.  He got on during one of these award shows and said, I have a message for somebody.  And it said, stop your drinking and partying.  And this is, you know, leading you into a bad life.  And supposedly he was addressing Britney.  Well, because they were lovers back in the day.  Yes, and I think he still cares about her on some level.  All right.  Next up, Anna Nicole Smith. 
[00:17:00]  Did Howard K. Stern murder her?  We'll be talking about it.  I'm done with that story.  Now that Britney shaved her head.  Yeah.  We needed something new.  I want to talk about Dead Guy after we come back from break.  Dead Guy.  Oh, my God.  Is this the story?  Dead Guy.  You've heard of Dead Guy by now?  I'll just add this.  TV, Dead Guy?  Yeah, TV, Dead Guy.  Oh, the creepy image in my head.  This is kind of something we've talked about on the show.  Yes. 
[00:17:30]  It's wonderful.  And it's so eerie and creepy.  Yeah.  Why don't we take a quick break?  Because Dead Guy in front of TV is just a great, great story.  We'll find out how Jimmy's weekend was in Lancaster.  You were in Lancaster.  Yes.  I say Lancaster.  And Anthony was doing some poker down at...  The poker of the Borgata.  Down at the Borgata.  Nice.  And also, we got our first, first Convertible Boy song.  That happened so quickly.  It's downright creepy. 
[00:18:00]  We'll explain that, too, if you haven't heard about Convertible Boy.  We got a lot to do, even though no one is up this morning going to work.  Wake up.  Wake up.  You forgot to not set your alarm.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and live.

[00:18:30]  Yo, check it out, the Opie and Anthony Show.  How great was the finish to the Daytona 500 yesterday?  Oh, we were just showing some clips and a little recap.  Wow.  I'm not even going to sit here and say I'm a NASCAR fan.  I really...  I'm not.  Oh, God damn.  But I was hanging out at FH Riley's, my brother's restaurant.  400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington Village yesterday.  Just kind of screwing around.  You're lying.  I saw your vehicle.  You got an eight on one side of your windshield and a three on the other. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, there you go.  Come on.  I really don't know much about NASCAR.  But we were watching it at the bar yesterday, at the restaurant slash bar.  And what a finish.  What a finish.  I don't even know who won.  I know they...  A race car guy.  I know one guy beat the other guy by like a foot, which is pretty impressive when you're  going close to 200 miles an hour.  It was a very close finish.  What do you know about the finish of the Daytona 500, Jimmy? 
[00:19:30]  Oh, those boys, they drive so fast.  It's crazy.  They're crazy boys.  But then what?  How many people crashed in the final lap?  Wow.  10 or 12 cars just sliding all over the place.  And the news here in New York, man, most people, especially if you're watching just  a quick sports report, you want to see all the crashes.  I'm sorry.  You want to see an entire recap of every crash.  I know I'm pissing off NASCAR fans now because they're like, you know, there's more to it 
[00:20:00]  than that.  It's about the finesse of passing and drafting and patience.  No.  But I guess...  People want to see machines hitting each other at high rates of speed.  But I guess when they put their sports cast together, they say, all right, we'll dedicate  20 seconds to the Daytona 500.  So they show the final lap where all the cars are starting to slide just before it gets  really ugly.  And then they cut to the finish. 
[00:20:30]  It's like, what are you doing?  Play this out.  I don't think there's been a finish like that in Daytona 500 history where this car is just  sliding all over the racetrack as two guys are fighting it out at the finish line.  Yeah.  You don't want to cut that off.  But they did.  They did because they had to hurry up and get to the NBA All-Star highlights.  Who cares?  And then Phil Mickelson just blowing it again. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, did he?  I missed that.  That zilch blowing...  Ugh.  I don't even follow a golfer.  I know he's a zero.  Yeah, he just...  Good.  He's...  So many people just, like, root for him.  And he just...  A little bit of a choke.  Time and time again.  A little chokage.  Time and time again.  All right.  Let's say hi to Todd in Georgia.  Let's get this out of the way.  Todd, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  How many cars wiped out during the final lap yesterday?  Like 14.  14 cars.  There was only 20 running at the end of the race out of 43 that started it. 
[00:21:30]  Isn't that amazing?  Only 20 cars running out of 43?  Nice.  Road warrior.  And that's what happens.  They put these plates on the carburetor to call it a restrictor plate.  Restrictor plates.  Make everybody run together, and you can't get no torque out of your car like Anthony's  Mustang.  When he hits the gas, it goes.  You got that carburetor restrictor plate.  You got to wait for it to wind up when that person's right on your ass.  And one little slip, and you're gone.  Right.  It's like the old IROC races where they would just all be together in one big...  There's nobody that will stand out. 
[00:22:00]  They did that to make it more exciting, to make these closer races.  They had the same person build every car to the exact same thing so that no one has  an advantage.  It's all about the driver and how he can maneuver.  See, I don't know.  That just blows.  Let them build whatever they want.  You got to use...  Rocketship if you want.  You got to use illegal fuel additives.  That seems to work.  Foreign substance, yeah.  Foreign car, foreign stuff.  You guys have a good day.  I'm checking out. 
[00:22:30]  I love you guys, ONA.  And I know Kevin Harvick won the 500, but I figured if we said that, most people would  be like...  Who?  Hmm.  What?  Okay.  Okay, then.  Okay.  I got that knowledge today from you guys.  Thank you.  And the people that know Kevin Harvick, they already know the results, so why mention it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Dead guy.  Let's get into dead guy.  Creepiest story ever.  Oh, dude.  Could be ever.  I was tooling around Long Island this weekend, throw on 1010 Winds, the news station here in 
[00:23:00]  New York every once in a while, just to kind of make sure I'm up on things.  Yeah.  And I'm like, no way.  I'm yelling at my radio like, no way.  Awesome.  Awesome.  Awesome.  This story's awesome.  I don't know if we have the actual news story, but it might be a better read in this case.  Yeah, let's go with the read here.  Body stays tuned in for a year.  After the discovery of the mummified body of an elderly man who died a year ago while  watching TV, Long Island officials are even more stunned. 
[00:23:30]  To learn, to learn, excuse me, the TV was still on.  Died in front of the TV a year ago.  Guy died a year ago.  In front of his TV.  In front of his TV.  The humidity in his house was so low that his body was preserved and it mummified sitting  in the chair to the point where the medical examiner said you could totally see his face.  He had his facial features and his hair was still in his head and he was sitting in his 
[00:24:00]  chair watching the television for a year of just 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  In the early morning, dark blue hours with the flickering TV light on this mummified dead  guy's face.  How great is that?  It was so creepy.  The image that that conjured up to me.  And what channel was on.  The sun just rising every day and coming in the window. 
[00:24:30]  Bright light.  Right into his face.  And he's just sitting there mummified watching the same channel every day.  With frozen eyes.  I hope it was something where, like...  I hope he was like one of these man's man.  Yeah.  And then, like, you know, they find him and it's figure skating on TV.  Like something happened when he was changing the channels when he died.  So he didn't get to a channel he wanted.  Yeah.  I'm hoping it was something like, just as simple as a channel, like a Fox affiliate. 
[00:25:00]  Where he could sit there and sitcoms are on.  Like there's Friends and Seinfeld and Raymond or something.  And like all these funny ha ha ha canned laughs are going off.  And he's just sitting there, errr, dead with the jaw kind of falling down.  Frozen dead guy with frozen eyes with, yeah, canned laughter all over his lip. 
[00:25:30]  At night, it must have been the worst.  At night with just him in the glow of the TV light.  And they're saying, how did this electricity stay on so long?  Because he hadn't been heard from or paid a bill since December of 2005.  Right.  And, uh...  So that's how they're figuring out when he died again?  Yeah, they said the electricity was left on.  But what about no family whatsoever?  They found this guy, finally.  A neighbor called up because, um, I guess one of his pipes froze and burst. 
[00:26:00]  And water started leaking.  And no one was there to fix it.  So, uh, one of the neighbors called the cops.  And, uh, when they went in, there they found him.  Sitting in front of his TV like he's been for a little over a year.  Every day.  Neighbors said, uh, he was a retired contractor who built his own house, lived alone, was blind, and suffered from diabetes.  Blind and watching TV for eternity. 
[00:26:30]  Probably just listening to the audio.  Although, uh, the mail had piled up.  They said they thought he had been, uh, put in the nursing home.  People just...  Piled up.  You know how much mail you would get in a year?  A year.  And the mailman just keeps dropping it off.  People just really don't care.  People just don't take notice.  They don't notice and don't care.  The mailman's probably just whistling every day.  Just whistling and just piling mail onto this mess of pile.  Throw it on the pile.  A year's worth of mail.  Just throw it on the pile.  I want to know what was on the TV. 
[00:27:00]  Why can't the news help us out?  We all want to know what was on the TV.  What, what, where was this?  Uh, Suffolk or Nassau County?  It was out in the Hamptons.  Oh, out in the Hamptons.  Yeah.  Hamptons?  Come on, my friend Jimbo.  He's a cop out there.  All right, let's find out.  Jimbo's got to tell us what was on the TV.  How great would it be if the guy was holding the remote with one hand and his pants were  dying around his ankles?  There was a tape in the VTR.  Oh, what a way to go.  He was old school.  Years worth of lesbians. 
[00:27:30]  Just hitting the end, rewinding and playing again.  Wow, that is just great.  That is a great story.  I want to know, that is really horrific.  Let's see.  The image is like out of a horror movie.  Yeah, let's go to Scott in Jersey.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I heard on the paper this morning, I think you had the logo channel on?  Yeah.  Isn't that the Gay Network?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Watching the Gay Network, mummified.  He was asleep, face down on the couch. 
[00:28:00]  He was playing the pillow.  Spent hours to pry that pillow out of his mouth.  Jaw locked up on him.  All right, Scott, thank you.  Just this dried out prune of an old man.  Like when you make those apple head mummy things, you carve the apple and let it dry.  That's what he was sitting there with a little tuft of hair, some troll hair on his head.  You think somewhere within the last year, just one eyeball just kind of popped out and rolled across the floor?  Oh, they dried up like prunes in his head.  It just kind of fell out. 
[00:28:30]  It was the low humidity, they said.  And he just sat there slowly every day, just drying out a little more.  A lot of people are asking, you know.  Tooch and Cummins.  Who paid his bills?  Because obviously.  No one.  No one was paying his bills.  No one was paying his bills.  And they were wondering how so much time went by with his electricity on that no one paid.  Yeah.  All right.  What's, well, we got the news story.  Maybe there's more to it.  I hope so.  Yeah, this was the story.  Well, this was the story of the weekend until freaking Brittany did what she did. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  It was down this long, lonely driveway off Wakeman Road where police came upon a gruesome scene.  The mummified body of homeowner Vincenzo Ricardo sitting in a chair in front of a television, which was still on.  The Suffolk County Medical Examiner says the 70-year-old widower had been dead for more than a year.  All right.  Oh, my God.  I was really shocked about it.  Neighbors Helen and Pat Boyle say Ricardo was blue.  Yeah.  Neighbors.  Neighbors.  Way to be neighborly. 
[00:29:30]  Paying attention.  Yeah, way to pay attention.  You got a neighborhood watch in your frigging town?  Did she notice the TV on in the middle of the night over and over again?  And apparently it was blaring when they walked in.  They said it was blasting because it must have been hard of hearing.  Old man volume?  Just old man volume.  Some bad show and a mummified dead guy watching the whole thing.  Oh, that is sweet.  Oh, my God.  And I was really shocked about it.  Neighbors Helen and Pat Boyle say Ricardo was blind and used this rope to help guide him from his house to the street. 
[00:30:00]  A rope?  A rope?  So he had a little rope that went from the doorway to maybe his mailbox that was chock full of mail?  Yeah, the mailbox was like 200 feet from the house.  The house was set back a bit.  I'm sure maybe that'd be funny as a neighbor to just make a joke and take the rope and extend it across a really major thoroughfare.  He just walks right across the street.  What were you doing?  Whistling a happy tune.  If he's a friend of yours, you just want to goof on him.  You tie it to your own waist and then you bend over. 
[00:30:30]  And when he gets to reach in the mailbox.  Just keep unwinding new rope into circles.  Where am I going from?  That mailbox is far today.  We got more on the story.  I'll just watch TV.  I don't feel good.  He was a nice guy.  Just walk there for his mail.  Sometimes he'll go for a walk down the road.  We didn't see him over time, but the ambulance had gone in a few times.  And he was taken out.  And then we thought he went to a facility and he was taken care of. 
[00:31:00]  But that seemed not to be the case.  The medical examiner says Ricardo appeared to have died of natural causes and his body was mummified because of the lack of humidity in his home.  Police found Ricardo while investigating a report of burst water pipes at his house.  I love the fact the neighbor says she was surprised.  I would hope you're surprised.  Yeah.  I'm surprised there was a dead guy sitting there for a year watching television.  Imagine if that's what you expected.  Well, he's been dead for a year.  I kind of figured.  Yeah.  We knew it. 
[00:31:30]  We looked in the window, saw him there each day getting a little drier.  He looks happy.  Yeah.  He's watching TV.  Imagine if he died in mid-laugh like that.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  And now neighbors are wondering, how could Ricardo's death go unnoticed for so long?  The fact that his house is up a long driveway and can't be seen from the street may be one  reason, but there were other signs that something was terribly wrong, like all the mail that was 
[00:32:00]  piling up in Ricardo's mailbox.  A year without no one coming up, like even sending someone to go check up on in person  is kind of weird.  If you think about it, bills, telephone, cable, and whatnot, it's in a pile of it.  Didn't you wonder where he went?  I thought he went to, like, you know, his family sent him to, like, an adult center somewhere.  Neighbors say Ricardo's death is a painful reminder of the importance of checking on your  neighbors, especially the elderly. 
[00:32:30]  Who cares?  It's very, very sad.  Nobody should die like that.  Nobody.  Guy must have been a real dick if no one looked at him for a year.  No one looked at him for a year, and everyone assumes.  How come you would assume they took him to a facility instead of assume he might be dead  in his house and maybe just knock?  Can I?  I gotta go back, because I'm a little confused here.  Look in the window.  Did the neighbor go, uh, no one should die like that?  Yeah.  That's a hell of a way to go, man.  Why?  You're just sitting watching television.  I had a great aunt go that way. 
[00:33:00]  101 years old, she died in front of the TV.  Was it all the way in the night?  How bad is that death?  No.  No.  Her sister, though.  Oh.  So let's calm down a little bit.  Halfway, mate.  CT, mate.  Man, I want to hear the end of this, the last few seconds.  His family sent him to, like, an adult center somewhere.  Neighbors say Ricardo's death is a painful reminder of the importance of checking on your  neighbors, especially the elderly.  It's very, very sad.  Nobody should die like that. 
[00:33:30]  Nobody.  Nobody should die like that?  No one should be left for a year to, you know, mummify.  Doesn't matter at that point?  It doesn't matter at that point, but as far as...  Honestly, I think the guy had a perfect death.  He's at his home watching TV on his favorite chair, and he dies.  And no one bugged him.  I could think of a million other ways to die that are a little more horrific than that.  No one bothered him, either.  No one bothered him?  He just sat there, drying out, like a shrinky dink in his chair.  Everyone has this idea of, like, you know, dying the perfect way, like, I don't know, 
[00:34:00]  in a bed with their family around.  Is that how it's supposed to go?  Yeah, like, it's in the movies, man.  A little pain, nothing going on.  The reality is, most of us are going to die in a horrific way.  All right?  Does it have to be horrific?  Are you moving, Baghdad?  That's the reality of it, though.  But everyone romanticizes it.  They all want that perfect death when they think about it.  Music playing.  Just don't think about it in the middle of the night.  It gets a little creepier. 
[00:34:30]  Hard to sleep.  I like to think about death when it's bright and sunny out so it doesn't scare me as much.  But, I mean, the guy had a perfect death.  Yeah.  In my eyes, in front of the TV like that.  All lonely.  I mean, he probably wasn't even lonely.  He probably hated his own family.  Apparently so.  Did they have reached the family?  Like, no follow-up on this?  How about you find the family and say, hey, did you notice?  Or how about find that friggin' mailman?  Who the hell was that?  Newman?  He's got to be the worst mailman ever. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  He just doesn't say a word as mail is piling up for a year?  That's just some schlep doing his friggin' job.  Eh.  Just drop the mail off.  Wouldn't you, like, tell a supervisor or something?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Call me crazy, but there might be something going on with this house.  Yeah, there's a problem here.  The mail is four feet high at this point.  Yeah.  The supervisor goes, what are you asking me for?  And it just shoots everybody.  And where was all this mail going?  Was it up in the trees and stuff at this point? 
[00:35:30]  Because it's just being blown around?  It would have to have been, yeah, blown all over the place.  Unless the guy had a friggin', like, one of those giant mail sorters that they got at the post office.  He didn't even have a little mailbox.  How much could fit in there?  A month?  Maybe the guy was just throwing his mail away.  Like, oh, crap.  This is how I get caught?  That's bad.  I looted his place.  Let's go to John in Pennsylvania.  John, what's up?  This is Kevin.  Hi, uh.  Hey, Kevin.  How about, uh, you're looking for a house, right? 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, get my realtor on it.  Ah.  Cheap house in the Hamptons.  Yeah.  Hey, it's a cheap house.  I saw a dead guy apartment a few months ago.  Yeah.  When I was looking around for a place in Manhattan here.  Too creepy.  All right, thanks, John.  I wouldn't care if someone died in a place.  I'd live in it with a guy still watching TV.  It wouldn't bother me if it was a nice enough place.  Just talk to him if you want.  Just keep care less.  Hey, what's on?  Turn it down.  What are you watching today?  Yeah, turn that down.  Did I tell you the, uh, the story of the French couple? 
[00:36:30]  No.  And the son?  They had two sons?  Uh-huh.  It's hot.  Well, I was, um.  An aristocrat's joke.  Still looking?  Yeah.  Still looking for a place in Manhattan.  We, uh, this was early in the search.  We went into this, uh, this brownstone.  And, uh, we're walking around.  This house is immaculate.  And it was a, it was a French couple and their son about, uh, 16.  Okay.  And, uh, the, the wife was following us around the whole place with this hope in her eyes, 
[00:37:00]  like hoping that we were going to like say, yeah, we want this place.  And she's straightening up as we go, even though the place was just perfect as is.  Perfect.  Like nothing out of place, you know?  And she's running around and she's kind of like adjusting things to make every room look,  you know, really nice as we're walking through.  And I just got just an eerie vibe in that place.  I'm like, what?  Something's not right.  So, so we leave this place and, um, and, and we go to the, the realtor and they're not 
[00:37:30]  supposed to say anything, but I'm like, look, what's up?  What's going on here?  There's something up.  What's up?  Well, their son committed suicide in there and they just want to get rid of the place.  I'm like, and now I'm going through my mind, like trying to figure out where in the house  he did it.  Cause we walked through the whole house and she was following us.  If she's going to fess up with that much info, she ought to tell you the whole story.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  Of where, where it was, how it happened.  It was definitely in that house. 
[00:38:00]  But I mean, what room, what happened, circumstances, everything.  I, I, I, I knew as I, I found out as much as I needed.  Well, did you start going back over it and like going, Oh yeah.  Like that's why there was police tape in front of that one room.  She walked by the one room.  Yeah.  And this here, we, we just had the hallway.  Oh my God.  Having a hallway decorated.  She walked by the room.  Just patches of paint on the wall.  I didn't notice one rug was very clean in one section.  Yeah.  They cut out the rug, put a new piece in. 
[00:38:30]  Taped off a section of a, somebody in a little handgun.  Chalked off.  I just thought it was art.  Missed your picture fell on the floor.  Body outline with the handgun dash to it.  Yeah.  On the floor.  All right.  Let's say hi to Chuck in Jersey.  Chuck, what's up?  Hey, Chuck.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hey, Jimmy.  I just wanted to know if he was watching reruns of Quincy.  How ironic would that be?  The man was dead for a year, Sam. 
[00:39:00]  Yes, he picked up his mail in a year, Sam.  Punch it out, fellas.  Best Jack Klugman ever.  Yeah.  Stupid homoerotic Sam just there to service Quincy in any manner necessary.  With perhaps a massage and feeding him marmalade in a tub.  Quincy had an Asian boy fetish.  He certainly did.  Young Sam.  Speaking of medical examiners.  Sam, we have to go to Thailand to solve this one.  Yeah.  Why?  Speaking of medical examiners, you see the one that's working on Anna Nicole Smith with 
[00:39:30]  that huge freaking lump in his head.  No, I've missed him.  Anyone else notice that?  He has a Gumby head.  Does he have a goiter?  You haven't noticed that yet?  No, I haven't seen it on the news.  All they keep showing is that stupid Howard K. Stern and Anna Nicole.  Yeah.  They got plenty of video I heard babble into Larry King and everything else.  That's all they show.  No, the medical examiner has got just a huge knot in the top of his head.  That's a big knot head.  And it's off to the side. 
[00:40:00]  It's like, why don't you find out what's going on?  In that skull of yours.  Before it's too late.  Sal, East Meadow, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Owen?  Hey, how you doing, Jimmy?  Hey, Sal.  Let's go.  Hey, listen.  I think Ricardo might have been waxing his car in the chair and he had a heart attack.  See, now that would have been pretty interesting for the cops to find.  Yeah.  Especially if he died at the right time.  Like, they find him in his pants around his ankles and his one eye shut and I was comfortable.  Like, ow. 
[00:40:30]  Let's go to Virginia.  Virginia, what's up?  Now, what's going on, boys?  All right.  What do you got?  It's good to hear that you finally found somebody with hair as dry as Kenny's.  Probably drier than...  We finally found someone that has drier hair than Club Soda Kenny.  Kenny's a creep, by the way.  Of course he is.  Where is he?  And I guarantee you, Kenny would have loved to have walked in and found that, it's not  just a pipe broken, he's dead.  Thank you, Captain Obvious.  Kenny slept in his car last night.  Why? 
[00:41:00]  And it's like 10 degrees in New York City.  Oh my God.  He picks me up this morning and we're just, you know, we're talking about each other's  weekends and, you know, he was in Lancaster, Lancaster, Lancaster with Jimmy Norton and  I'm asking how Jimmy did in the shows and stuff and then, and then he goes, and last  night's show, I'm like, relax.  Oh boy, look at his face.  He's all...  Why are you waving me off?  He waved you off. 
[00:41:30]  You were coming around, you were lined up for a landing and you got waved off.  You waved me off.  Now you, now you gotta go around again.  So, uh, he goes, and last night's show, and I go, last night's show, what are you doing  here?  Cause that can only mean that, like, Jimmy performed till 10, 11 o'clock at night and then you drove  to three hours back home and sure enough, yeah, he got back to New York city at two  in the morning, slept in his car just to pick me up and I go, Kenny, I could have taken  a cab today.  Oh, Kenny. 
[00:42:00]  He told me last night, I didn't even know you were coming.  Now I'm irritated.  Why did you stay on my couch?  He told me he's staying at CBS again.  I'm going to sleep on the couch.  I was going to, I was going to come in the green room here and I just pulled over and  went to sleep.  Oh, you should have stayed on my sofa.  The only reason I didn't, he's going to stay on the couch.  I'm like, oh, well, he's going to get up at four 30.  I don't want to be woke up at four 30.  Did you leave the car running with the heat on?  Yeah.  But he was outside.  Yeah, I know.  But do you know, sometimes people die like that.  I slept in a radio car for seven years.  Hence being brain dead. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  Hey, you have no product in your hair.  It's a little poofy.  He's got a little poof to his hair today.  It's a real fire hazard today.  It really is.  All right.  Why don't you go home?  Why don't you sit on my sofa?  Yeah.  Why don't you go home?  I'm fine.  Why don't you sit on my sofa?  Wow, you seem upset or something.  No, we got two.  Because I don't like when you make a fuss over me.  I'm nothing.  Oh, Kenny.  You know, I was right in town and I had a suite where it had a pull-out couch and everything.  And you deserve that. 
[00:43:00]  Right here.  All right.  And I wouldn't have invited you, but I had one.  Just bragging about my room.  You could have stayed on my sofa.  I'm fine, believe me.  That's why I have a sofa.  All right.  Let's go to James in New Hampshire.  People still impose and wreck my life.  James, what's up?  He never wants to impose.  He'd rather sleep in a car.  Like, you could have slept on my couch, Jimmy's couch.  It's freezing.  I know.  We don't care.  It's freezing out there.  James, what's up?  I hate to be a bother gentleman.  What?  I hate to be a bother gentleman. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, I know.  Hey, I just wanted to back Opie on the medical examiner, Gumby Head.  I actually walked up and punched the side of my TV the first time.  I saw him thinking it was out of reception.  You thought you had 1940s television.  One of those weird TVs where it starts stretching the wrong way up top on the screen.  That's how the guy looked.  What the hell's wrong with this TV?  Yeah, that's pretty funny.  Because, yeah, this picture doesn't do it justice.  But, well, if that screen was on, but why would it be?  Why would that be on?  Every morning we should turn on the screen.  All right.  Thank you, sir. 
[00:44:00]  All right.  Can you expand that picture, Iraq?  Yeah, unfortunately, you've got to look close.  But it's a huge knot on the left side of his head on the top.  It's kind of stretched out.  It's probably from crawling in the coffin with how he's banging it on the lid.  All right.  The first Convertible Boy remix after the break.  We'll explain this to Jimmy, because this went down when Jimmy was in Lancaster.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:44:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Let's get right back into it.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  This is the beauty of us.  We're about to talk about something that people talked about a year ago.  That guy that died in the house, he died a year ago.  This just did.  What he was watching.  Yeah, right?  No, we talked about Britney, though, so we're up to date.  Yeah.  But Jimmy, during the break, said that he's watching March of the Penguins. 
[00:45:00]  Finally got around to it.  Yeah, I bought the DVD on the road, and my girlfriend and I watched most of it.  Didn't watch all of it.  No.  No.  Just gets to the point where it's like, who cares?  Who cares?  Who cares about these little bowling pins?  Fat things, and all they do is walk, and they're still fat.  I hate them.  My girlfriend hated them, too.  She just thought they were creepy and gross.  Stupid penguins.  They just walk, and walk, and walk, and walk.  They have the dumbest system, which the movie shows, for reproducing. 
[00:45:30]  They have to walk how many miles?  Hundreds.  70.  70 each way.  Oh, 70.  80 each way, and then do the little trade-off with the egg, which is the crucial moment,  and then the other one walks back 70 miles and eats, and then walks back and comes back.  It's the dumbest method ever.  I love when the egg is hatched or whatever, and now they have to just hold it between their  feet, and one rolls out, and they have no means to save the egg. 
[00:46:00]  They just have to look at it, and they can't bend down and pick it up.  And you know the father does that, because he didn't want to knock her up to begin with,  so he just kind of boots it out into the cold.  Oopsie daisy.  The old daisy.  Well, it looks like we can take that unplanned vacation, can't we?  They have no...  They can't bend their spine.  No, they stand straight up.  They've got these things that kind of look like they might be arms.  They can't fly, but they have stupid, useless wings.  Yeah.  It's like they give them arms like a monkey with a thumb, so they can pick the egg up, 
[00:46:30]  shake it around, and go, here we go.  They can rub it to warm it up.  Nothing.  They've got to do a trade-off with these bony feet of theirs.  Dude, I rarely do obnoxious laugh in public.  If you're a faithful listener to the show, you know the obnoxious laugh.  I did it as I was watching March of the Penguins when one of those eggs rolled away.  Because it's so cold, the inside of that egg just freezes up instant.  It turns into an ice cube.  Oh, there were tears everywhere, and I decided that was a moment to do obnoxious laugh guy. 
[00:47:00]  Why not?  They walk so far, they stand there, the male penguins will stand there guarding the egg  in 80 below weather with 100-mile-an-hour winds.  It was just stupid.  That should have been called Penguins or Douchebag.  That should have been the name of that special.  I don't think the kids would have gone to see it.  It just shows you how great Puhar is, no matter who you are and what you are.  Even the penguins.  You women, you got gold. 
[00:47:30]  You got gold.  All right.  You should see Farce of the Penguins now, Jimmy.  She wants to see that.  We'll probably win well.  It's a great parody of March of the Penguins.  How is your girlfriend disgusted by the penguins?  I'll tell you what.  I wouldn't think twice about a penguin.  I don't find him cute, but I'm not disgusted by him.  I think they're stupid, funny-looking animals.  You want to just hate him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just want to open fire.  I want to go there and just end the species because they're all in that one area.  You give me enough weapons and I would just – and they would just go – they just run in circles. 
[00:48:00]  They wouldn't know what to do.  They just stand there.  Nature is dictating.  They have to stand there.  I would just open with a machine gun there.  Watch them all sit there in those dumb eggs and tip over.  Yeah, they don't deserve to be on Earth, especially because they walk 70 miles and the whole time they're walking, you know this is in their head.  Whoa!  Whoa!  They're going to fall down at any moment.  Do they really need to be on this Earth?  No.  If you could just go and blow them over. 
[00:48:30]  Here's why we didn't like them, and she especially, is because when they cover the egg, there's a part of their body.  It just opens up.  It's like a piece of skin that opens up and covers.  A little fat pouch.  A little fatty pouch that's slowly – it's slow.  It's like a curtain going down.  A curtain going down on the egg.  A little fatty pouch.  The egg's next show will be in an hour and a half.  You know that piece of the body is a delicacy in Hong Kong?  Is it really?  In Hong Kong.  I'd like to eat it while the penguin is still alive. 
[00:49:00]  Just grab it by its stupid beak and eat it while it goes, meh.  Still alive.  Jimmy ate its pouch and it's still alive.  Meh, meh, meh.  Fat pouch.  Let's say hi to Adam in Rochester, the home of Brother Weez.  What's up, Adam?  Hey, what's up, brother?  What do you got going on today?  My house got on fire.  Your house is on fire?  It's on fire now.  I woke up, a smoke detector sent me off.  Sweet.  You lose everything?  No, just the front of the house.  All right, then. 
[00:49:30]  Why are you calling us?  Exactly.  Wanted to hear all the details.  All right, Adam.  This flaming house.  Yeah, Adam, call back.  There might be some more that we could use there.  Hey, no filter, Paul.  I got a minute.  I love this guy now.  No filter, Paul.  I saw him this weekend on my way to Atlantic City, stopped down at Rivoli's.  They had a little Valentine's Day get-together.  In Tom's River.  Down at Rivoli's in Tom's River.  Yeah.  On our way to Atlantic City.  And no filter, Paul.  Of course, Denise. 
[00:50:00]  And as a couple, these two, I have no idea why they're together.  They cannot stand each other.  At this point, right?  They spent the whole time just yelling at each other.  It's like a Valentine's Day thing.  We're all having dinner.  It's great.  Having some of those king crab legs down there.  Oh, just great.  And these two are just insulting each other with the most inappropriate insults ever.  Is she still banging black dudes?  Nah, as far as I know. 
[00:50:30]  I don't know.  But he won't let it go.  He talks about how she had the black guy in the bathroom and serviced him in the bathroom  while Paul was downstairs waiting.  Yeah.  I guess they were dating at the time.  This goes back a few years.  She claims it was some kind of rape, but no.  She went into the bathroom.  The black guy kind of, you know.  Followed her in.  Hey, what are we going to do about this?  And she went to town on him.  Yeah.  And Paul holds that over her head.  And she does nothing but call Paul an idiot, a moron, a waste of life, complains about the sex life, his size, everything. 
[00:51:00]  And just out.  He's got a small one like that little head of his.  Apparently, he does.  According to her.  I believe if you hug no filter Paul really hard, his head will go to normal size.  Yeah.  Like a balloon animal.  Paul, he's just a balloon animal that needs a little tweaking.  Just that he needs a big, big, huge squeeze. 
[00:51:30]  Jimmy brought no filter Paul to our show.  Yeah, he does the merchandise for you to bring everyone on board with him.  Yes, and we met when we were off the air.  I was doing Tough Crowd.  He's like, I would like to do the merchandise for you.  I could do your merchandise.  Yeah, I'll charge you a 33 and a third.  33 and a third.  Where's Anthony?  Anthony.  This is how stupid we are as a radio show.  Jimmy goes, we have to get him on the phone just so he says 33.  I'm like, what?  So the whole interview, we're talking to millions of people, was us just trying to get him to say 33. 
[00:52:00]  Anything with a T-H.  Right.  Don't call me dim no more.  Just a fool.  And then he said 33 and we just laughed and laughed and laughed.  33.  Yeah, well.  All right.  So no filter, Paul.  He has taken this assault on the media thing and he's made it his own.  Yeah.  At this point, we're not condoning it.  We really aren't.  Boy, how about Cleveland with the streaker, huh?  Yeah. 
[00:52:30]  Wow.  That's terrific.  That's great.  Way to go, Rover.  Good one.  What'd he do?  Oh, he had a streaker.  Had some guy and he jumped behind a news guy.  Uh, was he totally naked?  I guess.  No.  No, he wasn't.  He had his underwear on.  What?  He had his underwear on.  He's going to streak his streak.  And he did that.  Don't make it show you how it's done.  And I guess Kimmel picked up on it and played the video.  And Keith Oberman.  And Keith Oberman.  And, you know.  Yeah. 
[00:53:00]  It's nice when you're doing something for about seven years and someone does it once and it gets all the press and credit.  But it's just, you know, obviously, now I'm not going to go hoo-hoo, we invented getting behind news people and being stupid.  But when you, you know, put as much time and effort into being stupid as we have, you hate when someone else does it like one time and gets all that press.  Anyway.  Annoying.  So, no filter Paul did another assault on the media on Friday. 
[00:53:30]  I think it was Friday.  And, man, they were not happy.  Guy's doing his report.  I guess a guy almost got electrocuted or something.  No, it was a dog, I think.  Got electrocuted on a metal plate.  I heard it was a guy.  Guy?  Getting out of his car.  Could be a different story then.  He was on fire.  His car was on fire.  The guy's trying to do a serious, you know, live shot and no filter Paul.  By the way, we've got to get smaller signs.  The signs are so big that you can only see part of the sign because they immediately try to zoom right in on the guy's face. 
[00:54:00]  This guy, got to give him credit.  He didn't miss a step.  He was mad.  You could tell.  But he got his entire story out.  And then Sue Simmons, here in New York, who hates us.  It's obviously.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, does she hate us?  Had a comment on what a professional the reporter was.  She has a dikey hairdo.  Who cares?  Oh, we're the only ones that make these people just get so annoyed on live TV.  They don't get annoyed when they do an Obama and Osama bin Laden story. 
[00:54:30]  Well, when they're doing their goofy bits in the morning, shut up with your fake integrity because it's the news.  It's untouchable.  Enough.  She's sitting there all pompous when they go back to her desk and has to comment on the professionalism of the reporter out in the field like it's 1950 and there's actually integrity in the news.  Shut up.  Yeah.  The old broad.  Just last week, you guys were doing some kind of clown story and you all had clown lenses on. 
[00:55:00]  We can't take you seriously anymore.  I'm sorry.  I don't like Sue Simmons because I don't know what race she is.  Who does?  She's oompa-loompa covered.  It creeps me out.  All right.  Here's the audio.  The video is up on opiananthony.com.  It's on YouTube.  It's all over the place.  We throw all our stuff on all the fine video sites.  Not that YouTube is a fine video site.  We're pretty much starting to hate those guys.  We like break.com.  They're whipped.  And gorilla mask.  Donette.  Yeah.  You know, Tyson was on that. 
[00:55:30]  That immigration minister who had those pictures with Anna Nicole that didn't look too good.  He resigned.  So those pictures were actually bad.  I don't think they were, Jimmy.  I don't know.  I think it's a knee jerk.  Again, I think they said you have to resign.  Oh, maybe.  Yeah.  You know, or you'll be fired.  All right, I'll resign.  Now, Chief Turning says he believes that the tires on Hagerman's car would have grounded the electrical current.  And if Hagerman had not gotten out, he may not have gotten shot.  Now, a spokesperson for JCP&L says an investigation is underway and that everyone should assume that all power lines that are down are live. 
[00:56:00]  And that he says that if you see one, you should get away and call your local power company.  We're live in Tenton Falls.  I'm Reg Chapman, News Channel 4.  All right, nice concentration, Reg.  Thank you.  Nice concentration, Reg.  Thank you.  What you don't see, and that's why you got to see the video, she is livid.  Oh, she's got the teeth and the look in her eyes like a bat.  She is annoyed.  You hear how he sped up his report? 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, mine got louder.  We're real louder.  Maybe that's why I thought it was the doggie getting electrocuted story because I completely zoned out of anything he was saying because I couldn't concentrate on what he was talking about.  Greatest fault of the media, buddy.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We got no filter, Paul, and his sidekick.  What, Chris helped you out as well, Paul?  Yeah, yeah, he did.  He's a good guy.  Yeah, Paul's on the other line with you, Paul.  Yes, sir.  So what happened?  Give us the behind the scenes.  We've all seen the video now.  Okay, so we get there, and there's like five TV channels there. 
[00:57:00]  And, of course, we're trying to pick which one to hit.  We don't want to mess with CBS, you know.  Very smart.  Like you guys have a career.  Thank you.  Very smart to leave the CBS affiliates alone for now.  Yeah, but the CBS woman just starts talking to us.  We're standing right next to the other reporter.  She's all nice, and then I'm like, you're really going to hate me in a minute.  And right after that, she goes, oh, no.  Oh, no.  As soon as she saw a lot of big signs, she just, her face changed from, like, nice woman to C. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, really?  Just like that?  It was hysterical.  I heard there was a little chase that happened after the chase.  There was some shenanigans going on because I happened to drop my keys back at the scene, and Paul made it to my truck.  And as I ran back, they descended on the truck, and they descended on me.  And Reg, Mr. Concentration over there, basically told me to find Jesus.  Find Jesus? 
[00:58:00]  He said, yo, man, you better find Jesus.  You better find Jesus.  Man, I'll come to your job.  He didn't sound like that on TV.  Yeah, he surely didn't.  Are you saying he kind of changes his voice for the television to be more accepted by mainstream America?  And why do you have to find Jesus?  We're just having a little fun.  You guys got to tape the after.  You got to keep the recorder going.  I know.  You need a camcorder.  Yeah, we were thinking that because, you know, once...  You were thinking it.  You were what, Paul?  He was thinking that. 
[00:58:30]  You were thinking that?  Yeah, thanks.  You should film this or get someone to film these because the reporters behind the scenes are such phonies.  It's great to see them angry.  Yeah, well, you know, the car goes surrounded, and there's guys in front of the car going, you know,  drive the car over me.  I need a reason to call the cops because, obviously, you haven't done anything legal yet,  but if you hit me with a car, I can call them.  Yeah, not to stand in front of my car in a threatening manner.  And it turned out that we think the guy that was in front of the car was that guy, Anthony Johnson,  from Channel 7, the guy with the air horn. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, dude, you've got to film these idiots.  You know how great it would be to have footage of a reporter standing in front of your car saying,  hit me?  Yeah, being an idiot.  Oh, he was really angry.  You guys need...  He was really angry.  That is the next step to the assault on the media that you guys are doing is bring a camcorder  and just record everything that happens.  Yeah, just in case because they're going to try to set you up eventually.  Get your side of it, too.  Like, when you guys are jumping up and down, if you had a camcorder, we'd be able to see  the back of the reporter, the cameras, the people that come running out at you. 
[00:59:30]  That's the stuff I want to see.  And know who did that?  Paul did it in Buffalo.  Yeah.  Buffalo Paul did some behind-the-scenes stuff when he did an assault on the media.  Yeah.  It's kind of interesting.  It was interesting, but, I mean, I really want to see...  That would have been a perfect opportunity, getting surrounded in the car by, like,  20 guys from various news teams.  All of a sudden, all the networks decided to get along.  They were united in the hatred of Paul and this program. 
[01:00:00]  Hey, guys.  Last year, Paul and I did one together over in Belmar during a storm, and Denise was in  the car filming, or so we thought.  Well, she thought she was.  And I was actually physically assaulted by one of their crew, and he was, like, basically  pushing me around and trying to throw me to the ground, and we thought we had it all  on tape, and the camera broke.  Oh, there you go.  None of it got on tape.  Yeah, it was in the middle of a storm, and when we went out there with the camera, it 
[01:00:30]  got soaking wet, and then the tape didn't work.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, Paul, the montage you put together is really good.  Oh, my gosh!  Yeah.  No Filter Paul put together a montage of all the assaults on the media over the last few  years.  Yeah.  It's on YouTube, right?  It's on YouTube.  It's on break.  It's everywhere.  Yeah, but how do you find it?  I'm just going to type OpieAnthony on break.com.  No, we got, like, 1,200 videos up, Paul.  How do you find your video?  If you just type it...  Our listeners don't have time to go through 1,200 videos to find the one I'm talking about  right now. 
[01:01:00]  No, no, assault on the media.  Assault on the media remix into YouTube.  Okay, there you go.  Opie and Anthony's AOTM remix.  Exactly.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Gentlemen, can I ask you a quick favor?  You think you could hook me up for the Ron and Fez big-ass night of fights this Friday?  Uh...  Why would we...  That's like asking the cast of Seinfeld if you could get me Friends tickets years ago.  Like, why would you...  Why would we be able to just, like, give away tickets to another show's event? 
[01:01:30]  Well, it was worth a shot, I guess.  That is the dumbest shot.  Why don't you call Ron and Fez?  Yeah.  Yeah, I tried, but you know how Earl is.  I mean, I've emailed him, like, four times.  All right, Chris, hold on a line.  We'll try to figure something out.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  And, Paul, thank you.  Yeah, now you know why that guy got caught in FNA.  Just cut Paul off.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Wake up, E-Rock.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The virus is spreading. 
[01:02:00]  Opie and Anthony!  All right.  Not everything has to be on the radio.  Let's go.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The O and A virus spreading across America.  We've got some great stuff coming in.  Some great stuff.  Our phone number, by the way, 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE. 
[01:02:30]  There it is.  That's the end of the race yesterday.  Wow.  Yeah, God.  But we're sliding on their roof.  That was unbelievable.  I hate NASCAR, but I was checking that out yesterday.  That was a great race.  Yeah, whenever you get that kind of carnage,  it brings in the people that aren't even big fans.  Number one at the box office, Ghost Rider.  Ghost Rider.  I think it was because of our interview.  With Nicholas?  Yes.  Good old Nicholas Cage.  Nicholas Cage.  We put him over, you think?  We put him over.  That's all right. 
[01:03:00]  44 mil.  Eek.  Jesus.  It just must have been nothing.  Anyone else having a tough time finding a movie they want to go see?  Not only at the movie theater, but even in the hotel movie thing.  I've seen everything already.  It's frustrating.  I want to go to the movies this weekend.  I went through a whole bunch of different theaters.  I'm like, I don't want to see any of this crap.  Nothing.  I'm not going to see Norbit.  Norbit.  Norbit.  You will not see me watching Norbit. 
[01:03:30]  Starring Eddie Murphy.  And Eddie Murphy.  He's got to laugh when he says the second one.  Because it's just so funny that he's doing two things.  Because it's so outrageous that that would...  Wait a minute.  But you already said starring Eddie...  How is it then?  Major Nelson.  How could Eddie Murphy be in this place?  But I just saw him.  Major...  Starring Eddie Murphy.  And get a load of the...  Hold on to your hats, folks.  You're not going to believe this one.  Guess who it also stars.  We already said Eddie Murphy.  Guess who it also stars.  No, no, no. 
[01:04:00]  Guess.  Guess.  Guess, motherfucker.  Guess.  Eddie Murphy.  What?  I know I said it already.  You're insane.  It's Norbit.  And theater's near you.  I'll say shut up.  All right.  Hey, uh...  Well, we have to decide what we want to do next.  We've got a 15-year-old girl that has a hiccup problem.  A really bad hiccup problem.  Could you have cancer?  We got...  Remember the news tease?  Huh?  Okay, hiccups.  Oh, oh, oh!  Come on now, see? 
[01:04:30]  Now this is the kind of stuff where maybe the news has a point.  All right, hold on.  I've got to go to the News Tees Hall of Fame.  By the way, if you missed it, we added a couple to the News Tees Hall of Fame.  Oh, they're brilliant.  Really fast.  These are the ones that made the Hall of Fame.  Could your house be making you fat?  Tomorrow, CBS 2 News at 5.  Can your house be making you fat?  Yeah.  And this one made the News Tees Hall of Fame.  And the ingredients in shampoo that can make a boy develop breasts.  Tonight at 10. 
[01:05:00]  That's hilarious.  Get me that shampoo.  This is the new batch of news teases that made our Hall of Fame.  Sex offenders may be in your house.  And I love it.  Maybe in your house.  You don't know it.  And, of course, this one.  The problem solvers have uncovered sexual predators sent to live in our nursing homes.  Do you really know who's living down the hall?  Could this happen to your mother?  Oh, could this happen to your mother?  I hope so.  What are you saying?  Ouch. 
[01:05:30]  You're hurting me.  That's one of the stories, by the way.  Seniors raped in retirement community.  I go for that one.  It's funny.  It's hot.  Let's get all the elements of good radio.  Because they're senile, so no one believes them.  Last night, one of the men came in.  It was a black gentleman.  And he did things to me.  And now I hurt in certain places.  Sure you do.  Well, listen to this lady.  You saw a 20-year dead relative, didn't you? 
[01:06:00]  Listen to this lady.  We might as well do this.  It's a quickie.  And then we'll get to hiccup, girl.  The American flag hangs proudly from many homes in the Leesburg neighborhood of Coachwood Colony.  It is a place where many go to live out their retired years in peace and comfort.  But for at least two women, that peace and comfort has been shattered, replaced by fear and suspicion.  All I could see was his eyes.  Because he had his face all covered up.  Last June, when this 77-year-old woman... 
[01:06:30]  You know what?  Let's just stop it here.  Let's...  What's happening?  Yeah, what...  I'm trying to get foot headphones so he could hear.  Oh, she did not sound hot at all.  No.  She doesn't sound hot at all?  I couldn't believe it.  I couldn't see his eyes.  Imagine if she said, I don't know what was happening, but he just had one long eye and it was in front of me.  I couldn't believe it was just his eyes.  Was it?  You could see it was his eyes.  Her teeth are falling out.  Because he had his face all covered up. 
[01:07:00]  Last June, when this 77-year-old woman told me about her violent attack,  she awoke to a stranger in her bedroom at 3 in the morning.  A prowler.  Salt-and-pepper hair.  He did not say a word when he repeatedly raped her.  I didn't know whether he was going to hurt me or what, but he didn't.  And he didn't try to steal nothing.  He just did his thing and left.  Oh, he stole something.  Even she knows how worthless that is.  Right.  How worthless that piece of real estate on her body is at this point.  It's a misdemeanor.  He took nothing. 
[01:07:30]  It's a misdemeanor.  Believe me.  It's a misdemeanor.  It's nothing.  After the age of 70, it's a misdemeanor.  It's like a...  Yeah.  Jesus.  It's like carjacking a jalopy.  No one cares.  How do they rape her repeatedly?  I have enough trouble once with my girlfriend.  How do you rape an 80-year-old woman repeatedly?  Like you're finished and you're like, God, I could do that again.  What's the matter with you? 
[01:08:00]  I don't know, man.  Repeatedly.  On after the other.  Guy's a machine.  And all she worried about was this guy stealing her stuff.  With his salt and pepper hair, Kenny Rogers was banging her.  He sang to me.  He didn't take nothing.  He just did his thing and left.  Like she doesn't.  She knows.  That was the same way her marriage went for years, probably.  Quick thumping. 
[01:08:30]  And then the hubby's off to work.  He didn't take nothing.  Eight months have gone by without so much as a single lead.  And Leesburg police think the man may have struck again this year on February 4th.  When a 75-year-old woman reported waking up to a stranger who was fondling her in bed.  What the hell is wrong with people?  Ew.  Exactly.  Fondling.  A 70 what?  A 75?  A 75.  That's not fondling.  That's awful. 
[01:09:00]  That's not fondling.  It's right.  It's got to feel like.  It's probably a corner.  It's like.  I thought she was dead.  Waking up to a stranger who was fondling her in bed.  There's a lot of similarities between the suspect's description, their method of operation.  Just a lot of things right now are pointing towards it could possibly be the same person.  In each case, the man gains entry by breaking a window and unlocking a door.  Both attacks have occurred in the early morning hours when it was still dark. 
[01:09:30]  And it's very possible the attacker lives in or near the Coachwood Colony Mobile Home Park.  One of the victims did state that she actually watched him walk down the street and did not get into a vehicle.  Is that possible, really?  I thought the guy was flying in from somewhere else.  Yeah.  Just to get these old broads.  Wow.  And she watched him walk down the street and not get into a car?  How about call the police?  She probably kept yelling, come back.  Where are you going?  I thought we were celebrating VE Day. 
[01:10:00]  Old broad has no clue where she is.  Hey, sailor.  Sailor, I'm a rapist, you dummy.  Fundling her.  I'll give you a little something for what you did to those crowds.  What are you talking about, you dumb old broad?  It was the Japs.  Yeah.  The Japs came in.  You know how they are. 
[01:10:30]  They ought to be put in camps.  They were.  Yeah, this is playing in her room.  Why don't you come over here, honey?  I know how to shake a leg.  The one I didn't lose to diabetes.  Now, come on in here and do me.  Hit me like I'm the beaches of Normandy.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Poor old bastard.  Good for her. 
[01:11:00]  Da, da, da, da, da.  I thought maybe we could go out dancing afterwards.  Just walking down the road.  Oh.  You think he left some evidence?  Yeah.  How do you finish that up?  Yeah.  All right, so a hiccup, girl.  All right.  Could frequent hiccups be a sign of cancer?  Watch News 8 at 10.  Another one from the News Tees Hall of Fame.  Yes, well, this story came in over the weekend.  Yeah.  I guess this girl, she's like 15.  She's been hiccuping for, I don't know, like a week straight or something like that. 
[01:11:30]  I got a cure.  A 15-year-old St. Petersburg girl is home from school with a very unusual problem.  She cannot stop hiccuping.  Jennifer Mee has hiccups about 50 times a minute for three weeks.  Three weeks.  Doctors have tried to help her.  Even home remedies are not working.  She's now hoping someone who has a cure for chronic hiccups will get in contact with her.  Well, you definitely have to kind of break up the rhythm of her breathing. 
[01:12:00]  So she needs maybe something to stop her.  If she's breathing through her mouth, you need something to plug that up and then breathe through the nose  and then have something interfere the breathing altogether where maybe she has to swallow a few times over and over again  and then breathe through her nose.  And I really can't think of anything that would fit that criteria.  Yeah.  A 15-year-old girl.  This is the shorter version of the story.  They interviewed the girl and she said, because like everyone knows she's got this problem for three weeks 
[01:12:30]  so wherever she goes, people are trying to scare her.  Boo.  Do they do this stupid, boo?  Who gets scared by the word boo?  Boo.  Stop it.  Wouldn't you just go with a really loud scream out of nowhere?  Why?  Boo.  Didn't go.  She used to go boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Invite an uncle that hasn't been welcomed to the house back.  That'll scare her. 
[01:13:00]  What's he doing back here?  My hiccups are gone.  I'm having these bad thoughts.  I want to talk to our listeners, but I don't know what's going on.  Are any of these good?  You're still trying to figure it out?  You don't know?  I did it.  No clue.  Let's just take a random one.  Oh, this never, ever worked.  Who is this and where are you calling from?  I'm Ann from Elmwood Park.  Hi, Ann.  What's up?  About that girl with the hiccups, something really bothers me. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  What?  When I have the hiccups and I talk, I hiccup louder.  She doesn't hiccup when she talks at all.  So you think a hiccup girl is faking it?  I don't know.  I tried doing what she's doing, like, you know, by myself here, and I can't breathe like that.  I can't continually fake the hiccups.  Wait, so when you give yourself the hiccups.  What?  Oh, when you try to fake the hiccups, you can't fake it like she might be faking it.  Yeah, I can't fake it like that. 
[01:14:00]  I can't breathe that way.  Oh, my God.  But I don't understand why she doesn't have them when she talks.  I have them louder.  I'm sure most people have them anyway.  Is this Britney Spears?  No, I have hair on my head.  Just shave your head.  I have hair on my head.  Well, Ann, what do you think that could be?  I mean, we'd love to hear your theories.  Oh, of course we would.  I'm boggled.  I really don't understand how that sounds.  Boggled?  Boggled.  Yeah, well, it could be a couple things, right?  Boggled means barren.  Well, I guess I'll let this phone screener do his job after all.  Yeah.  Thank you, Ann. 
[01:14:30]  They do serve a purpose.  How about that?  Of course they do.  I hate Ann's confusion.  Ah, she's still on the line.  Maybe what she's saying is it's up on YouTube, and it's fake.  But Steve may have put it up as real.  Yeah, what was that about again?  Oh, God, what were we laughing?  What happened this morning?  In the office.  Steve, apparently, this was unbeknownst to me until today, Steve is one of the biggest  suckers when it comes to MySpace or YouTube fake videos. 
[01:15:00]  Now, fake videos are all over YouTube.  They're these set-up videos that try to come off like they're real, and the second you watch  them, anyone with an iota of common sense can say, this is staged.  It's fake.  This didn't happen.  And you watch real things, and you go, okay, that's cool.  That's real.  Sure.  Because, first of all, the real ones never look good.  The camera work isn't good.  It usually looks like it was captured spur-of-the-moment kind of a thing. 
[01:15:30]  And you could tell.  It just happens.  These things are all, they're planned.  The video camera just happens to be facing in the right direction.  There was one this morning that they pointed out that Steve thought was real.  Hidden camera catches cheating boyfriend?  Yes.  Okay.  Hidden camera catches cheating boyfriend.  All I know is Steve was very excited about this video, and he wanted us all to see it.  He thought he found a gem.  It's like the bride cutting her hair off one.  I mean, it's so fake. 
[01:16:00]  We knew that one was fake right off the bat.  It's fake.  They're these drama groups and these actors that want to get a name for themselves, so  they fake it and put it up on YouTube.  Well, Steve just bites.  He bites at every one of these.  Oh, my God.  This is so great.  You've got to see this.  It's wonderful.  And then we watch it and go, Steve, it's fake.  I just want it to be real.  I want it to be real.  Yeah.  I'm protecting.  You see the boom in the shot?  Well, I'm seeing a video camera on the floor next to DVDs. 
[01:16:30]  You see some DVDs in the picture like, ooh, this camera just happened.  No one would set up the camera like this.  And a couple's making out and doing all sorts of stuff on the couch.  And then, what, the boyfriend comes home and catches her?  What they're doing is, yeah, the camera's focused on the couch, focused, using the term loosely.  It's very blurry.  Like, they blurred the whole thing.  Well, because the camera wasn't supposed to be there.  It's not supposed to be there.  It's all set up.  It's so impromptu. 
[01:17:00]  So this guy and a girl are what can only be described as some of the worst acting of making out I've ever seen.  They're on the couch, fully clothed.  And they're just kind of, like you can tell, they're not boyfriend and girlfriend.  They're acting.  So they're kind of trying to touch each other.  But you know the girl doesn't want to be touched by this guy and doesn't want to take the act that far.  So he's just kind of rubbing her arm.  And they're getting into these weird positions with their legs.  It looks fake.  And then the girlfriend comes in. 
[01:17:30]  And she loses her mind.  The trollop that the guy's with kind of goes out of frame.  And then the girlfriend attacks the boyfriend perfectly in frame, never leaving the camera frame.  It wouldn't happen like that.  And the fight is fake.  It's her just crying and screaming, Steve, you're an adult.  Steve, you bought into that one.  Of course I did.  I wanted to be real.  And then when I realized it's not real, I feel like a jackass.  Remember that time you brought UFO footage and it turns out it was just a clip from an Ed Wood movie? 
[01:18:00]  You really are.  It looked so real.  Boob.  Wait, what are you pointing out, Sam?  Oh, Sam.  Oh, this is another one.  Wait, what up, Sam?  Steve is the king of IMing me things and saying, check this out.  And it's always, this is one of these kids in a parking lot.  And there's one kid in a cardboard box and he's on a skateboard.  And they're saying that he's freaking people out because they think it's a moving box.  And, you know, everybody's getting scared.  So they decided to put it in the middle of the parking lot. 
[01:18:30]  And so he's in the box in the middle of the parking lot.  And then the camera shifts to the other kids who aren't in the box just doing silly skateboard tricks and then shifts back to the box that the kid must still be in.  And a truck comes and smushes the box and runs it over.  And all the kids shout, oh, no.  And the camera turns off.  Oh, no.  And the camera turns off.  Steve is convinced that this child was just smushed by a truck.  Smashed by a truck in a box.  And meanwhile, there's an obvious cut where they go to the crowd shot and then back to the box. 
[01:19:00]  It's like you're amazing with this stuff.  How much money have you sent to Nigeria?  I only got that one.  I only got taken by them twice.  I see so many of these videos.  And I think that my barometer is on.  But it's so askew.  You really are the worst at identifying these for fact or fiction.  No.  I'm awful.  I'm awful.  I would do horribly in a crime scene investigation unit. 
[01:19:30]  What, Sam?  Yeah, he's owned and run a website for years that specializes in viral videos.  And he can't tell a real one from a fake one.  Steve is one of the pioneers of the viral video craze.  He was doing this crap years ago.  Hello, guys.  I had to call you.  This is amazing.  It's an actual alien autopsy.  It's happening right now.  No, they're cutting it open.  I can see it.  They found aliens.  It's got to be on Drudge soon. 
[01:20:00]  Tell the guys to get this story together.  It's going to be huge for tomorrow's show.  Alien autopsy video.  Alien autopsy.  That's like four years ago, was that?  Wow.  About four years ago, that video hit?  Oh, that's really funny.  Let's say hi to Corinne in Connecticut.  What's up, Corinne?  Hello.  How are you guys?  What's up?  We were hoping we could come watch you guys do the show.  Why?  We're sitting outside in the freezing cold.  Really?  Outside with a friend.  What's your friend's name?  Dan and Chris. 
[01:20:30]  Goodbye.  Click.  They have the chick call.  Smart move.  Yeah.  Smart move.  It's like the old days where you had the chick hitchhiking while the guys waited.  That was always the thing.  The guys would wait off to the side and the girl would do the hitchhiking.  They would have to take their bras off.  And then the car would pull over.  Like up their shirt a little bit.  Yeah.  And two guys would come out of the woods.  Like you wouldn't just step on the gas at that point.  Right.  What the hell are you doing?  What is this?  A set up?  All right. 
[01:21:00]  On the way.  It's a creepy show today.  There's a creepy theme to this show today.  Because just when you thought it couldn't get creepier, we had dead guy in front of the TV for a year.  Very creepy.  We had, well, Britney Spears.  We talked about that, obviously.  We had the lady getting raped.  Yeah.  And out of the way, we got the sex offender that goes on a touching spree out there on Long Island.  Groping.  Groping.  And we also have a wheelchair-bound pedophile who offs himself. 
[01:21:30]  Oh.  This is classic.  That's great stuff.  Something to do with signs.  He couldn't take the signs anymore.  The signs?  People were just holding up signs.  He couldn't take it anymore.  Good fam.  It's comedy in its purest form.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and live.

[01:22:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  We got Corinne back on the line here.  Corinne, what's going on?  Well, besides getting naked, what would I have to do?  Get up there.  Yeah, Corinne's downstairs with two guys.  And you guys want to check out the show live?  Yes.  And besides being naked, what can we have you do so you can come up here?  Yes.  What else could a girl do that we don't really know? 
[01:22:30]  We don't know.  Like maybe if we knew you in some capacity, we would go, oh, Corinne's good at this.  Well, she'll do this on the air.  But we don't know you, so the only thing we could do is something possibly physical, which  would be to have you nude.  Or she could shave her head.  Yeah, or shave your head.  Do you want to join Team Brittany?  No, not really.  Do you have a special talent?  I'd have Pat Duffy spank me.  What do you look like? 
[01:23:00]  All right, hold on a minute.  Hold on a minute.  Mmm.  So, can we pull your jeans down?  Uh, if you really want to.  What are you wearing underneath?  Some kind of a thong thingy?  Uh, no.  Big old lady bloomers?  Not old lady bloomers.  You got just regular panties?  French cut.  French cut.  All right, how tall are you?  5'9". 
[01:23:30]  Jesus.  Wow.  And, uh, how much do you weigh?  Uh, 200.  She's 5'9".  Anyway.  I think it'd be fun to watch her get spanked.  Might be fun to watch her get spanked.  Yeah, man.  Big, big girl like that?  Yeah, big, big, uh, chubby girl like that?  I think that'd be fun.  That actually might be good.  Who's gonna do the spanking?  I don't care.  We'll all do it.  Don't matter.  Someone will do it.  Where's Pat Duffy?  E-Rock, you want to spank a fat broad?  Okay.  All right, E-Rock's in.  Go get her.  Get her. 
[01:24:00]  Um, while we're getting her, a question has been brought up by a lot of people that needs  an answer.  What happened?  Well.  What happened?  Well, albeit it involves you, your picture that E-Rock took.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  In the bathroom.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That wonderful work of art you left in, uh.  E-Rock doesn't know how to take pictures.  That thing is easily 18.  Well, that isn't even the point, though.  That's easily 18.  He just, he didn't film it right.  He didn't film it right.  No.  It, it's, it's very, um, big. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  And it, it, it was left in the, uh, bathroom.  Yeah.  There it is.  We're looking at it right now.  Danny's, like, waving it off, like, oh, please.  Now, you were very, you were so proud of it.  Yeah.  You came out and said, E-Rock, go in there and take a picture.  Yeah.  You are out here.  Oh, I know what you're talking about.  You're noticing a complete lack of evidence of any toilet paper in there.  I know what you're talking about.  What did you do?  Clean as a whistle, buddy.  No, stop it.  Clean as a whistle.  Okay.  All right. 
[01:25:00]  I didn't, hold on.  I'll say this much.  I didn't assume it was clean as a whistle, but it was.  How did you not use toilet paper?  Just one quick square, and then you realize all is well.  There's nothing left in there.  It's, it's in the wastebasket.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Is that why it stinks in there?  Ew.  It stinks.  The bathroom won't stop stinking.  But I swear to God, clean as a whistle.  No, it didn't.  It was.  Smell the bathroom.  E-Rock. 
[01:25:30]  Put it in there.  But it's all about.  E-Rock, back in the bathroom and smell.  But, Ed, it's all about presentation.  You can't have that.  That makes it look silly.  We're going to check.  I would understand if this.  You, you do it.  You're still in there.  Yeah.  And you're kind of just having your pants kind of down, and you go, quick, snap a picture.  You're behind the door.  Whatever.  And then you finish your business.  You buckled your pants and came out here.  I did what you do, but there, you know. 
[01:26:00]  But you put it in the garbage.  There's no, there.  I'm trying.  I'm trying to work my way through this, because I can't understand it.  Should lock the girl in there to smell it for the rest of the show.  The bathroom has been reeking for two hours.  We're going to check this clean as a whistle thing.  E-Rock, get your finger.  Yeah, E-Rock.  I want a quick check.  Trust me.  It was clean as a whistle.  All right.  All right.  That's all right.  I mean, toilet paper detracts from the artistic value. 
[01:26:30]  That's what I'm saying.  Of course, these people know.  But he just didn't get the perfect shot, because it was ridiculous, right, Jimmy?  Now it's gone, right?  Oh, yeah.  Now it's just gone.  Oh, yeah.  Well, let's not forget Danny's.  Oh, Danny.  In the shape of a W.  Danny's would be the most amazing one ever.  That's why he's waving mine off.  Mine looks like child's play.  Look at that.  Show foot.  That thing is, yeah.  Yeah, see? 
[01:27:00]  It's in the shape of a W.  That's a masterpiece.  That is the upside-down McDonald's logo.  It's very artistic, Danny.  Coincidentally enough, that's exactly what he ate to make it look like that.  There you go.  No, he did not, because, you know, because the arch.  Yeah, McDonald's.  Yeah.  Okay.  It's going to be more.  Think.  Think dinty more beef stew.  Think a lot of rain out west. 
[01:27:30]  No, Danny's actually a scientist.  If you turn it around, it's actually an E.  He was doing E equals MC squared.  Ah, what a genius.  Right, boy.  All right, he's showing the pal talk camera for the people that have pal talk.  By the way, Kyle from Newark, Ohio.  Are you guys going to talk about Kelly Osbourne saying that one of her family members has HIV?  We don't know who it is.  She didn't say who.  It's probably a distant cousin.  You're just hoping, Jimmy, because I know you love the family.  She was out of HIV and AIDS benefits, excuse me.  She was up there, and she said, this is very close to my heart, because one of my family 
[01:28:00]  members has HIV.  She cried.  She got off stage, and everyone's left to wonder who has the AIDS.  Well, the stupid media.  I mean, it's not Ozzy or Sharon or Amy.  It's probably a cousin or somebody in the family.  I mean, you have extended family.  It's just probably somebody she knows in the family.  So now everyone's trying to figure it out, though.  The media will be like, is it Ozzy?  She should have said, at least, it's not my dad or my mom or Jack.  Do you know anybody who's died of AIDS? 
[01:28:30]  Oh, yeah.  A lot of people.  Well, Jimmy would know.  You travel in those circles.  What do you mean a lot of people?  How many?  I can think of three right off the bat.  Right off the bat.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wait, one, two.  Know them personally?  Oh, yeah.  One of my best friends died of AIDS.  Just one of my worst deaths I've ever had.  It was when my friend died of AIDS, yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  He was one of my longest childhood friends.  Was it intravenous drug use? 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  Sex?  No, no.  They've all been drug use.  They're all guys who are undercover.  Really?  Yeah.  They get clean and they get the hiv, you know, but they want to die of AIDS over.  So they get cleaned up and that's what they're left with.  Oh, I should have just kept doing the drugs.  Yeah.  Why bother?  Yeah.  Wow.  You know anybody?  No.  Hey?  It's the circles you're traveling.  You know, when you're in rehab, something like that, obviously you're going to come across  some people.  I don't know if I know anybody who's gotten sexually.  I mean, I'm sure I do and don't know it, but I don't know if I can think of anybody that's 
[01:29:30]  died of who's gotten sexually.  I know one.  Homo Richard.  Yeah.  Barely know.  But I didn't even know.  Didn't even know he was dead for five years.  Could have been you.  Sitting in front of a TV.  Could have been you.  Huh?  Could have been you.  Could have been me.  I'm sure he was clean back then when he tried to molest me in a tree fort.  It could have been you, man.  Hey, do you want AIDS?  You probably were like one beer away.  You don't even know how lucky you were. 
[01:30:00]  I don't know about that one beer, three beers, six beers away.  Let me tell you something.  Me and Joe Curry have been drunk off our asses, off a lot more than just a couple of beers,  and it never came across our mind to be gay.  Speak for yourself.  To be gay.  To be gay together.  I could never.  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  There was even, if you're like standing in line, like if all the guys are going to movies  or you're just waiting, wanting McDonald's or something, and you ever have the line move 
[01:30:30]  and you swing your arm and it hits your friend or somebody that you don't even know, like  right there, right in the crotch area when you're walking, and you just go like,  and you rub it to make it feel better.  But we've been in a lot of situations, especially with the band.  Remember we were in Toronto?  We're all like in one room, 11 guys, like a basket of kittens.  Yeah.  We're just all over each other.  You know, it's like.  Yeah, you got to sleep where you can.  Yeah, man. 
[01:31:00]  And believe me, there's enough drinking going on.  It's not three beers away.  That's what the gays would love to think of.  The gay community says, yeah, every straight guy is what, a beer away.  Yeah.  Keep feeding them.  Keep feeding us beer.  Trying to figure it out.  We should have that experiment.  Yeah.  See who falters among us.  Just have a keg party and see who just kind of walks away with a gentleman.  Steve has a near beer, and he's all over you. 
[01:31:30]  I had some water.  Please.  Yes.  Whip it out.  At least finally I have a legitimate excuse.  I have an excuse.  It was for the radio show, and I was intoxicated.  It was grape juice, but I thought it was wine.  Put that in my face.  Show me who's boss.  Clear the field.  Some men are going to do some kissing.  Oh, he's still here.  Oh.  Oh.  Hi, Steve.  We weren't talking about you or anything.  Hey, this could lead to a convertible boy. 
[01:32:00]  Yes?  Yeah.  Do we have the clip from Friday's show?  Yeah.  All right.  It's very disturbing.  John Minnelli likes when we over-explain everything, so we should over-explain this.  Yeah, please.  Do that.  Well, Robert Kelly was in for Jim Norton on Friday because Jimmy was in Lancaster.  Lancaster.  With the Amish.  Were there any wall-bounds nearby?  No, there was nothing.  What about a King Cullen?  I like wall-bounds.  It's called Wawa's.  Oh, Wawa.  Wawa's.  All they have is Wawa's. 
[01:32:30]  Wawa.  Find stores who advertise on this program.  Oh, yes.  I went in there because I like the cameras.  Wawa.  Wawa.  Wawa.  I bought all my coffee at Wawa.  Wawa coffee's good.  I know it is.  They do a good job with their coffee.  Did you see any Amish?  Like anyone cares?  Why did I add that to the program?  I stink.  I know it.  That was a good point.  Wawa does have good coffee, and there's no reason for it not to be mentioned.  You see the Amish?  Yeah.  They're all over the place there.  Are they?  Did you see a horse and buggy?  We took a buggy ride.  You did. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  You and your girl?  And Kenny.  And Kenny?  And the same buggy?  That's not romantic.  Why was it?  Jesus Christ.  You were talking about this.  Or was the horse tired and Kenny decided that little Jimmy needed his ride anyway?  I'll pull it.  Horses can be dangerous.  They buck and kick.  I'll pull the buggy.  Well, as she and I are kissing, we look over, and you know how horses just don't care who's  behind them when they do certain things?  Yeah.  Wide open and just letting it go.  I loved it.  Oh, no.  It was great. 
[01:33:30]  It was just so symbolic of our relationship.  That's a bunch of horses.  Yeah.  Oh, that's terrible.  But you were going to, I heard about this for now for a week at least in advance, how you  and your girl were going to take this nice little buggy ride in Lancaster with the Amish.  And Kenny's with you?  Well, it was an open buggy, so it was cold, but he was there just sitting there under a  horse blanket.  Is there a blanket?  Yeah, they give you the stinky horse blanket.  It smelled awful.  Yeah, it smells like a horse. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  And then did anything happen underneath the blanket?  Yeah, I was shivering.  I was shivering, and I watched a horse do something even more impressive than you this morning.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Did the Amish go to your show?  Are they allowed to laugh?  I don't know.  I don't know the rules of the Amish.  Oh, it's the Amish, too.  And I don't need to know.  I can't decide how I feel about them, because they do kind of live off the land.  They don't ask the government for anything.  I can't decide if I admire them or if I just want to kill them all.  I don't like them. 
[01:34:30]  I don't know if I do.  I don't like them.  It's 2007.  Stop it already.  Stop it with the horse and buggy.  I think they're depressing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I petted a horse.  It was nice.  Did you?  Yeah.  Did you?  Because here's what it is.  If the entire country was like that, we wouldn't be this country anymore.  It would have been taken over by some kick-ass conqueror with missiles.  If the entire country was like that, it would be 1810.  Yeah.  It would.  It would. 
[01:35:00]  Because that's how it worked back then.  Right.  You want to listen to some Convertible Boy remixes?  I do.  Not really.  All right.  Well, Robert Kelly was in for Jim Norton on Friday.  He did a good job.  And we got into, like, gay songs and stuff.  I don't even know how.  There's a song on, ah, whatever.  We can't play it over here, so whatever.  And I guess Robert said he has a gay song.  Yeah.  Bobby came up with a gay song or something like that.  There's a gay song that he sings, that he was writing, but he only wrote, like, two lines to it. 
[01:35:30]  And he sang it for us.  And we thought the audience could pick up the ball and maybe add some music to it.  Redo some of the clips over again so it's longer than just two lines.  Do a little remix.  I hope this is a bit that Preston and Steve would do so we'd be in the same company as a great morning radio show like theirs.  Plus, all I want to do is look good in John Minnelli's eyes.  That's right.  And he seems to like their show.  Would Preston and Steve do a bit like this?  Boy, I hope so. 
[01:36:00]  Boy, I hope so.  Gosh, golly, gee, just like us, John.  Boy, I hope they would do something like this.  I haven't forgotten.  Give me an auto and George.  The weekend did nothing to calm me down.  Anyway, here's the clip from Robert Kelly on Friday.  I wrote a gay song, by the way, too.  You did?  I did.  I wrote it.  You want to hear it?  Yeah.  It's called Convertible Boy.  Oh.  I wrote it.  It's for a cartoon. 
[01:36:30]  He's a superhero and he drives a convertible.  And he's like a white, upscale dude.  Yeah.  And it starts out like this.  Convertible boy.  He's so amazing.  Convertible boy.  He's so cute.  That's really gay.  That's really gay.  So creepy.  That's really gay.  I wrote that.  I just picked you singing that over some young boy's body.  That's the beginning of the thing. 
[01:37:00]  He jumps in and he's looking in the rear view and he's so cute.  So that's the clip from Friday.  He's got so many issues.  He's got way more issues than a little Jimmy Norton.  Just to come up with something like that.  And then we got excited.  We're like, all right, let's hear more of the song.  It's like, that's all I've written.  I'm like, what?  So we put the pieces up on the website and now the listeners are trying to make a song  out of what Robert Kelly sang on Friday.  And we said you could add to it. 
[01:37:30]  You could add to it lyrically as well as musically.  Yeah.  So they're coming in.  You want to hear a couple of these real fast?  Sure.  I don't know where we should go with this bit.  If we should continue down this road where we get convertible boy songs or maybe as a  show we try to make the gayest song ever, ever made.  The gayest song ever made.  That could be a goal of our show.  Well, for how gay that was, him just doing it acapella, when people added in music, it 
[01:38:00]  really took on a whole new gay life.  But I'm thinking we'd do work parts.  We all do like, I don't know, moaning, whatever it would take.  Throw it on a website and see if the listeners could come up with the gayest song ever.  Is that a good bit?  Oh, oh, I hope so.  Oh, boy, do I hope so.  What do you got over there, Ed?  No, I'm just looking for the gayest song ever.  How are you looking for it?  Well, I might actually have it. 
[01:38:30]  What?  We might.  That's just great music.  And, of course, playing the xylophone on Robert Reed's ribs.  Greg and Bobby, get in here. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, no.  Prostate cancer exams again.  Bobby, it's your turn.  Let me just snap this rubber glove on.  Ah, screw the rubber glove.  Who needs it?  Didn't use one on this.  Why use it on my hand?  Who knew back then?  Poor Robert Reed.  Can't blame the guy.  He didn't know.  Went from the Brady Bunch to playing a tranny in a TV movie.  Yeah. 
[01:39:30]  Well, he really wanted to tell people, hello, I'm not the guy you watched for three, four years.  Hey, so why don't we play a Convertible Boy remix?  They took the raw audio of Bob Kelly there.  Here's the, well, actually, we do have some audio of Robert Reed.  Yeah.  Um, when he was having sex with that wrong person.  See, if that tiki wasn't around, giving him the AIDS.  See, in case you don't know, Robert Reed died of AIDS.  Well, he was the father on the Brady Bunch, which was a television show, late 60s, early 
[01:40:00]  70s, very popular, still showing reruns today.  Yeah.  See, because you've got to explain why a guy's being spanked by another guy.  And be gay.  That's what we're getting at, because now we have to explain why we're over-explaining.  Okay, I got the gayest song ever.  All right.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba.  Oh, song.  I thought you meant singer.  All right, here we go.  This is Lunchbox.  Eric, he took Bob Kelly's audio and he came up with this.  Convertible boy. 
[01:40:30]  Hey.  Oh, oh, convertible boy. 
[01:41:00]  Hey.  He's so cute.  Wow.  Convertible boy.  Hey.  Convertible boy. 
[01:41:30]  He's so amazing.  Convertible boy.  He's so cute.  Yeah.  Bobby's gay.  Bobby's gay.  What do you think?  Just face it.  He's trying to deal with it, but when he was talking about Sam on Friday, that wasn't fake. 
[01:42:00]  He was talking about how he would, you know, have sex with Sam.  It's okay, because he was in four-star homes.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, and he's trying not to be, you know.  He's like with the girlfriend and everything, and it's just not working, though.  When he comes out with a convertible boy song out of nowhere and can really sell it.  He sold it all right.  He put it over completely with his delivery, and that horrible piano music you only hear  in cancer treatment commercials. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, God.  But now that's one type of gayness, you know, the very mellow.  Who would think the same words by the same person could be brought upbeat into a gay  dance tune?  But someone actually did that.  Well, we got, I think, I don't know if this is that.  We got John F.  Let's listen to this one.  John F.  Took Bob Kelly's convertible boy.  Just the little that Bob, you know, gave us.  He's holding the rest inside for whatever reason.  Even wanting more. 
[01:43:00]  We really wanted more vocals from Bob Kelly, but John F.  took what Bob gave us, and he came up with this version.  Mm-hmm.  The film.  The film.  The film.  Yeah, this is gayness.  He's so amazing. 
[01:43:30]  And there to the boy, he's so cute.  See?  Yeah.  This is just...  What visual are you getting right now?  Just amyl nitrate poppers, pillow biting, and the smell of musky, musty... 
[01:44:00]  Musky.  Things just being places they shouldn't be.  Like men kissing each other, but holding the back of each other's heads and roughly kissing each other.  Yeah, where did this music come from?  Wow.  See, this bit has potential.  It needs just a little more.  Maybe a little more vocals from Bob Kelly, so the listeners can really have fun.  The work pieces are up on opnancy.com so you can make your own remix. 
[01:44:30]  This is music that after you hear it, even the next day when you're eating a sandwich and you bring it up to your mouth,  your fingers still...  They don't smell like the sandwich.  Especially if it's tuna.  It smells nothing like that.  Not a fan of sushi, are you?  Nine.  And then we got Septic Tank.  Septic Tank?  Well, Septic Tank...  The art of Septic Tank.  We told the fine folks out there that they could add vocals to Bob Kelly's vocal. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  So this is the first one that is actually trying to write more lyrics to the masterpiece that is Convertible Boy.  It's pretty bad, I think.  This is the beginning of a bit I think that's going to work very well in the coming weeks.  You're seeing the beginnings here.  So here's Septic Tank.  Septic Tank.  Septic Tank.  Convertible Boy.  He's so amazing.  Convertible Boy. 
[01:45:30]  I gotta be honest.  We played this during the break a couple times and I hate...  I wanted to strangle this guy.  Yeah.  But now I like the song.  You don't like it?  Yeah.  He's almost got a Jane Gumm delivery.  Yeah.  Convertible Boy.  Convertible Boy.  You better start 14.  Convertible Boy.  He's so amazing.  Who are you?  Convertible Boy. 
[01:46:00]  He's so cute.  Who are you?  One day, I was walking down the road.  Convertible Boy.  He's so cute.  You gotta love the hook though.  No, I can't take this guy.  He thinks he's being clever and he's just sitting there making things up as he goes along. 
[01:46:30]  I like it.  I like it.  Maybe we should learn how to tune a guitar.  Yeah.  He didn't want his guitar tuned.  He's going for the out of tune effect.  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:47:00]  Well, it goes on and on and on.  Yeah.  And that's another thing.  On and on and on and on.  It just goes on and on.  Yeah.  Your Convertible Boy song has got to be less than two minutes.  All right.  Let's shut it.  Let's keep it.  Because, you know, ADD.  That's what America has these days.  We don't have enough time to sit through this crap.  All right.  So there you go.  There's potential there with Convertible Boy.  A little bit.  We don't know where it's going to end up.  Maybe we get Bob Kelly to write some more lyrics.  You know, but you could write a song with what Bob has given you. 
[01:47:30]  It's up on opanthony.com.  He is supplied.  Corinne is ready to go.  All paperwork filled out.  So this beast is going to get spanked by who?  E-Rock.  E-Rock, you going to spank abroad today?  E-Rock doesn't have the oomph and gumption, I think, to do this.  E-Rock?  I'll give it a try.  Yeah, a try.  Sexy, dominating attitude.  We don't have a big, brawny guy to slap her.  Well.  We're all looking at Steve.  Steve.  We don't want a rolled-up fist punched to her face. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, Steve, you've got to stay out of this one.  We know you hate women in general.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Ah!  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Ah!  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Ah!  You know what?  People are saying they're depressed.  They need a happy song.  All righty.  Oh!  BABABABBA 
[01:48:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:49:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:49:30]  We have that scale.  I bet you...  Don't we?  If she's admitting to two, that means she's 220.  We have to get this last story on before we get Corinne in here, because it's a good one. 
[01:50:00]  Which one?  I was critiqued because I say we have to a lot.  Oh, were you critiqued on that one?  Yeah, because the audience would perceive that as something we really don't want to talk about.  But we have to.  But we have to.  Because you said we have to.  No one listens to radio that closely.  Oh, it's not that big a deal.  It's just a thing that people say, like, it's a speech thing. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  And we have to, meaning...  Couldn't mean a positive thing.  Oh, my God, we have to do this, because it's unbelievable.  I thought that was obvious, but I guess it wasn't.  We got a sex offender going around touching people on Long Island.  I got to tell you, man.  Oh, he was.  We broadcast to most of America and a lot of Canada, most of Canada as well at this point.  Long Island, I would have to say, leads the nation in just creeps.  Creeps.  We get the creepy crimes on Long Island. 
[01:51:00]  We really do.  Nothing too crazy, but just always creepy.  Suburban, yeah, creep crime.  A lot of creep crime.  I don't know what that's about.  Maybe because they all shop at Wall Bounce.  Or King Cullen.  I like Wall Bounce.  Anthony likes King Cullen.  I like King Cullen.  He's the king of all Cullens.  You know where I like shopping?  When I'm in L.A., I like to go to Vons.  Vons?  You don't like Ralphs?  I like Ralphs when I'm in L.A. 
[01:51:30]  I go to Vons.  I prefer Vons.  Vons.  I want to keep it local for some people upstate.  Wegmans.  Eh?  Oh.  That's for you.  Oh, you.  Wegmans is better than Wall Bounce.  Bounce.  Dopiest name for a grocery store.  A Wall Bounce family.  A D, a B.  It's just Wall Bounce.  It really is just awful.  That's how I had it like go to school, though.  All my books said Wall Bounce on it. 
[01:52:00]  Wall Bounce.  Wall Bounce.  Yeah, because we were poor.  I couldn't have, what are they called, book things?  Book covers.  Book covers.  I couldn't have a cool book cover.  I couldn't have a cool Star Wars book cover.  All my books said Wall Bounce.  Oh, and some said King Cullen.  King Cullen.  All right.  Yeah.  So we got this creep on Long Island.  He's driving around.  He's deaf, I guess.  Yeah.  It's so hard not to laugh at these stories. 
[01:52:30]  I know we piss off people all the time because we just don't show a heart, but how could you  not find some of this funny?  This guy's a creepy ghoul.  The guy's like deaf and he goes on a touching spree all over Long Island and they finally  catch him.  I guess he was like driving up to girls and he was doing drive-by touching.  Because he's such a fat slob that he couldn't get out of his car, grope, get back into his  car and drive away.  Right.  They would catch him. 
[01:53:00]  Hey, can I just quickly get everyone up to speed?  The local news here in New York, and we want the rest of the country to get involved with  this.  When you see your local news doing something ridiculous, instead of talking about the war  or some real issues, you got to call our show.  Here in New York, it's just been a bonanza.  A bonanza.  One channel, I don't even know what channel anymore because they're all the same in my eyes.  They were doing a beach ball workout.  Yeah.  They were playing with beach balls and working out.  And then this other channel was showing like men squashing watermelon with their heads. 
[01:53:30]  There was some kind of watermelon squashing competition where you had to use your head.  So they were showing that.  And now we're watching like yoga.  Some type of yoga where there's this man in this bikini bottoms.  And he just, he just, he's laying down on his stomach and he kind of arches his back to the point  where his feet are on his head. 
[01:54:00]  His feet were touching the top of his head.  The back of his head like.  Yeah.  He was in a complete circle.  It's some of that.  You know what he does.  It's some of that Bikram.  Bikram yoga.  I think it's called.  Bikram.  What?  Bikram yoga.  How do you know that?  What is that?  What is Bikram yoga?  It's yogurt.  It's where they keep the.  Yoga.  It's where they keep the room really warm.  So the girls barely wear anything.  But unfortunately, the guys barely wear anything as well.  It's like what?  120? 
[01:54:30]  108, I think.  108 degrees?  Yeah.  And you do yoga.  108?  As you're doing yoga.  Yeah.  It's great for you though.  Yeah.  How is it great for you?  Because you're losing weight.  Your yoga is very healthy.  Well, I can understand the yoga part, but how about some air conditioning?  Oh, no.  No.  You'll get that later.  It keeps the muscles loose.  Does it?  So you can get into the faggy positions.  That's neat.  So you can get into some of those faggy positions.  Yeah.  This guy can actually hold and do a popper with his feet.  He can just dip his toes below his nose and inhale a popper.  All right. 
[01:55:00]  Listen.  Here we go.  Sex Offender Goes on Touching Spree.  The sex abuse spree started here at this stop and shop when he grabbed an 11-year-old girl.  Half an hour later, there were four more victims.  And cops say this wasn't the first time.  He has no.  There's so many people around at this time of the day.  It's very scary.  It began about.  You know what's funny about that lady?  And see, this is where we get in trouble.  But see, it's just humor.  Just relax.  They're interviewing these broads that would never get touched by anybody.  Oh, no.  They weren't getting groped.  Also, you know, they got to get the eyewitnesses. 
[01:55:30]  Not the eyewitnesses, but just talk about it.  Yeah.  And they just find the scariest broads.  And they're sitting there on the news going, it's very scary.  They're not looking for you.  They're these typical, fat, Long Island housewives that they interviewed.  And I couldn't tell one from the other.  They interviewed like three of these women.  And I swear to you, they all look the same.  You thought it was the same person, right?  Same woman.  And cops say this wasn't the first time.  He has nerves.  There's so many people around at this time of the day. 
[01:56:00]  He has nerves.  I guess she's okay if it's at night.  Yeah.  He has nerves doing it where there's so many people around.  And broad daylight.  I'm not shopping here anymore.  I'll go to Waldbaum's.  He's just pissed that she wasn't picked.  He's got nerve.  Yeah, she told him.  The gall of him.  Right.  It's time of the day.  It's very scary.  It began about 2.15 Saturday at a stop and shop when he targeted a young girl.  He focuses on the child who's 11 years old. 
[01:56:30]  The mother's no more than three feet away.  When he goes up to her from behind and he grabs her and puts her in a bear hug and starts to thrust her against his body.  Oh, God.  He was pulling the old cucker spaniel on her.  Yeah.  He just grabbed her.  Oh, you'd have to kill that guy.  What if you're that girl's father?  Oh, yeah.  You've got to go to the courtroom and kill him.  You would have to do that.  Nothing short of death for the guy.  But there is some humor. 
[01:57:00]  That's how ridiculous it is.  Oh, please.  The guy is a huge fat slob, too.  Is he really?  Just a big, fat mess.  He just lost his mind.  His perv switch went off.  Yeah, his perv switch went.  I've got to touch women.  We talk about the perv switch all the time on the show.  We all have it.  We really do.  We all have the perv switch, but most of us keep it under control.  You keep it in check.  Usually, it's a passing glance.  You see a girl walking down the street, especially spring hits.  They start wearing a lot less. 
[01:57:30]  You give her the look.  You kind of look at her legs, look at her ass, boobs, anything like that.  But these guys have to take it a step further.  They can't just look.  Yeah.  It's like, hey, look at that.  That's nice legs.  We'll see you, girl.  What a nice looking ass on her.  She sure has built it.  Must touch her.  I've got to grab her now and hump her.  Like a dog.  Right.  And he's doing it.  And you're like, what?  The rest of us, though, we'll get pretty close.  And something just happens internally, and you move on with your life. 
[01:58:00]  That's called fantasizing.  Yeah.  Putting it in your mind's eye.  Things like that.  This guy just lost his mind.  Here's what flashes in your mind when you're going to do it in real life.  You think of jail, and you go, no.  No.  I won't do that.  I'm afraid if I wouldn't go to jail, it's all I'd do is grab and go.  Oh, you'd be a groper.  I'd rape, attack, and laugh about it.  It's jail.  You're what FBI calls a secreter.  See, jail, good.  Jail, good?  Yes.  It's a deterrent. 
[01:58:30]  All right, let's move on with this here.  His next stop was the Target parking lot at the Broadway Mall.  He grabbed and groped a 35-year-old woman who got away by throwing...  How do you glope somebody?  Did she say glope?  I think, and it's on tape.  She could have done another take.  His next stop was the Target parking lot at the Broadway Mall.  He grabbed and groped a 35-year-old woman who got away by throwing coffee in his face.  A few minutes...  All right, Hamilton.  All right, right?  No shoes, no shirt, no dice. 
[01:59:00]  Awesome.  Totally awesome.  Does anyone else find the humor in how ridiculous this guy is?  He's 11, 35, anything that's not a male.  Yeah.  He's just humping.  Face.  A few minutes later, yet another woman, then another in nearby parking areas.  With them, he didn't even bother to get out of the car.  He just had the window down, and he just stopped the car very close to them, within grabbing range,  and he grabbed them and pulled them over to the car when he attempted to either unzip their jackets or unbutton their jackets or grab them in a sexual nature. 
[01:59:30]  What a creep.  This guy just passed the point of no return where he was just like, I'm a big, fat loser.  I'm getting in trouble, so I might as well keep going until they catch me.  Yeah, I just, I can't get anything.  I'm all frothed up in a sexual frenzy.  He's got a touch.  And he's deaf, let's not forget.  And this is how they stopped him.  Then he reached across a counter at a 7-Eleven on Jerusalem Avenue to get at the female cashier. 
[02:00:00]  It all came to an end when he crashed his car in the Ikea parking lot and cops arrested him.  Nassau County police say he was arrested for a similar crime last fall.  Just shoot him.  Yeah, how is he out?  Yeah, he's done.  Last fall?  How do you do things and just get, you know, I was always under the impression if I did something bad, I'd just be away forever.  Jesus.  Bring her in.  These guys do awful things and they're just out.  Let's say hi to Doug in Queens.  Doug.  Hey, what's going on, guys? 
[02:00:30]  Hey, Doug.  What's up, Doug?  Nothing.  I just wanted to let you know one time I was fried my power switch hanging out with some friends down in South Beach.  This is a smoke in the drill of a lifetime.  Pulls up out of, gets out of a Ferrari at like the 7th Street parking lot and starts walking over to the elevator.  We all hold the door for her because she's the oddest thing we've ever seen.  She gets in.  It's three of us.  One behind her.  Two all right.  One left.  And we all make eye contact.  And instantly, we all look at the stop button.  Man, I tell you, we all almost hit, we almost all broke our perv switch at the same time. 
[02:01:00]  They almost hit the stop button in the elevator.  Wow.  We were looking at her and we were like, I don't know what to do, but something has to happen here.  Yeah, that's odd.  You don't find many hot girls in South Beach.  No, no.  No, no, no.  We're running out of time.  We're going to have to talk about the perv switch tomorrow.  Damn it.  Because, I mean, there's a lot more to that.  Thanks, Doug.  All right.  Thanks for having me.  Oh, yeah.  We got to get through this.  Let me spin around and take a look. 
[02:01:30]  How about I'll turn it?  All right.  I am...  You're what?  Pleasantly surprised.  Really?  Hi, Corinne.  Hello.  How are you?  Pretty good.  Corinne, you're from, what, Connecticut?  Yep.  And you wanted to see the show?  Yep.  Last Wednesday was my birthday, and this is what I wanted to do for my birthday.  Oh, that's very nice.  How old a gal are you?  28.  Oh.  Are you really 200 pounds?  Yeah.  You're among friends now.  Yeah.  More like 210, 212, 220, 5. 
[02:02:00]  Everyone's young because they're saying you still have your pants on.  Do we really have to do this?  We certainly do.  Yuck.  Let me turn around here.  I think Corinne is...  I haven't even looked yet.  I think...  I'm going to line her up on camera.  There we go.  A little better than I thought.  I mean, definitely nice.  Thank you, Jimmy.  You're a tall girl.  Yes.  Yeah.  I mean, she's just wearing sneakers.  And a lot of black.  Yeah.  You know why the black? 
[02:02:30]  Why, Uppy?  She knows.  You want to tell everybody.  Black's a good color for you.  I think she's...  You're proportioned?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  She's a big girl, but not really big.  We got a hard out today.  We got three and a half minutes left in the show.  Get those drawers down.  We have a hard out.  Nice.  Get those drawers down.  Why are you wearing mom jeans?  Well, just answer as you're unsnapping your belt.  They're kind of like mom jeans. 
[02:03:00]  They're a little, like, puffy in the front.  You know?  You're wearing a, like, a librarian belt.  Why can't Tom run in now and stop us?  Take them all the way off.  Pull and just slide them down to your feet.  Slide them down.  Yeah.  To your ankles.  There you go.  Look at her.  All right.  That's good.  Okay.  All right.  Don't hide it.  Don't even try to pull it down or hide anything.  There you go.  Those underwear are huge, by the way.  Yeah.  Why are you wearing such big undies? 
[02:03:30]  They're, like, the most coverage you could possibly get in an undergarment.  Well, I don't like having dental floss up my ass.  Well, we're not talking about that.  We're not talking about, like, a thong or anything like that.  It's on the sides.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, those are very, like, those are utilitarian, purely.  You ought to maybe, well, what about the little boy shorts or something else?  You don't have to have.  You said little.  You don't have to have.  I wasn't really expecting to take my pants off today, so I didn't get prepared. 
[02:04:00]  Did you wear a matching bra?  No.  No?  Pull up the shirt.  Let's see a little bit.  Just the bra.  Yeah, just a little.  Just the bra.  Just the bra.  I want to see if it matches at all.  Oh, my gosh.  You are so unmatched.  Wow.  You are not planning on any type of get-together with any guy.  No.  Some girls are prepared all the time.  You weren't prepared for a car accident today.  No.  Yeah, what happens if you got into a wreck and the EMS guy cuts that sweater off and goes,  Jesus Christ.  Look, we can do so much with you, but we got two minutes left, so, Iraq, you're supposed 
[02:04:30]  to spank her in, so this is going to be just unbelievable.  Here's what we're going to do.  We're going to bend you over that.  Okay.  Right there.  And then give your ass a sound thrashing.  No, just walk over with the pants down.  That's fine.  Yeah.  Do the old, uh, do the shuffle.  The shuffle.  Do the get paper out of the hall closet shuffle.  All right, Steve's in the way, I think.  Someone's in the way. 
[02:05:00]  Remember, the camera is right here for our pal talkers, so don't interfere.  All right, Iraq, give me Iraq a mic.  Iraq, you're going to spank her, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's all you got.  Make it sexy, please.  There you go.  Pull the shirt up a little so more of the butt is exposed, the underwear, yeah.  Now, Iraq's pulling up the big panties to get some.  Now, Iraq, look at the camera.  See this?  Don't get in the way of it.  There you go.  All right.  Here we go. 
[02:05:30]  Are you?  What is wrong with you?  Holy Jesus Christ.  What is wrong with you?  Oh, my God.  You just assaulted her.  Iraq.  What the F is...  I underestimated Iraq.  No, wait a minute.  You don't know how to spank a girl.  You don't spank a girl like that.  I completely underestimated him.  I have completely turned.  I'm on your side now, Chris.  Wow, did he whack her?  You're a sick F.  Did he whack her?  Did you hear that? 
[02:06:00]  Dude.  Jimmy's stunned.  Jimmy, what?  Why would you do that?  You got a nice big ass, just spank it.  You don't have to punch it.  Dude, you gave her a Rocky punch with your hand.  You wound up and smacked her.  Oh, almost tripped in.  That would have been good.  It would have ruined your gazelle-like image.  Let me see your ass now.  Let me see if there's a mark.  Holy mother of God. 
[02:06:30]  Turn, baby.  This way.  She's...  Dude, she's going to be...  You have a bruise that is like blood is coming to the surface.  And a handprint.  I see a perfect little Iraq handprint.  And right where the middle finger meets the palm,  that must have been where the brunt of the impact happened,  because that's where she seems to be almost...  The blood is coming out.  I'm impressed.  Holy...  Did that hurt?  Yeah.  You ever been spanked before?  Yeah.  Do you like getting a little spanking?  Yeah, I do.  Do you like it that hard? 
[02:07:00]  No.  No.  No?  Well, it didn't make me cry.  It didn't make her cry.  Let's be honest here.  Wow, that was really hard.  It's easy to goof on, but no girl wants to be spanked like that.  B-Rock.  B-Rock.  That was assault.  Your spanking skills.  Look at Jimmy's disturbed.  I can tell.  Jimmy is really disturbed about this whole thing.  You want it...  What's wrong?  He's just like, what's wrong with you?  Dude, that sounded like a punch.  You want it to sound like a slap.  That's...

[02:07:30]  It was...  She went flying.  She made a sound.  It was great.  She wound up and ran.  Can you come back tomorrow so we can see what the bruise is like?  Oh, I can't.  Sorry.  You've got to work.  All right.  Well, that was something.  E-Rock, now spank the right way.  Yeah, do it the right way.  We've got to get off the air.  How about...  Other cheek.  Yes, other cheek.
