<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of the British Open, focusing on Tom Watson's performance and a young amateur's impressive score.  The hosts then segued into a conversation about men wearing pink.  A significant portion of the show detailed a prank orchestrated on comedian Bob Kelly, involving access to his apartment via a key obtained from his wife.  The prank, involving Jim Norton (calling in from LA) and Joe DeRosa,  was documented on video and extensively analyzed, with the hosts playing audio clips and speculating about Kelly’s pre-prank activities, including accusations of pornography viewing.  Norton recounted his experiences at the ESPYs, including encounters with Don Rickles, Bristol Palin, Al Sharpton, and Sally Field,  and discussed the movie "Change-Up" and Hollywood hypocrisy. A brief mention of a news story about a Hasidic Jew suspected of murder concluded this segment.

The show continued with a discussion on whether convicts assault child rapists and murderers in prison, followed by a discussion of Emmy nominations, specifically Louis C.K.'s and a scene from his show featuring Jimmy.  The hosts then discussed a child murderer who had karaoke videos online, previewing his unsettling song selections ("If I Never See Your Face Again," "Bring Me to Life," and "Broken").  Bobo's absence was noted, along with the death of a *Home Alone* character actor.  A graphic, sexually explicit commentary followed regarding a photograph of Helen Mirren in a red bikini, leading to a discussion about ageism in the portrayal of sex symbols. Opie shared anecdotes about his bowling experiences.  Listener calls, including one from a gay caller and another who insulted the hosts, were also featured. The segment touched upon Bobo's potential appearance, a previous segment about KFC, sponsorship difficulties, and internal business matters.  A discussion on U2's massive stadium tour followed, encompassing ticket prices, merchandise sales, Bono's charity work, and tax avoidance strategies, culminating in a discussion of Johnny Cash covers of U2 songs.

The next segment featured a comedic, insulting song about a staff member, Kenny, focusing on his obsession with order and cleanliness. This transitioned into a prolonged and uncomfortable bit with former contributor Patty, involving repeated, unsuccessful attempts by the hosts to pressure her into touching Opie's penis through his sweatpants.  The segment also included discussions about Patty's age, relationship status, perceived drug use, elephant attacks, racist imagery, Patty’s work experience, and their views on a Brooklyn murder and the Casey Anthony case.  A brief call from David from Israel about airport security was also included.

A subsequent segment centered on sexually explicit conversations with several female guests (Brie, Adrian, and Patty) and Bobo. The hosts repeatedly pressured Patty to engage in sexual acts with Bobo.  Brie's large breasts became a significant focus of the conversation, and the segment included detailed discussions of body parts, sexual acts, and crude humor.  Kenny was also present.  A fake baseball ticket was also discussed, and Bobo later engaged in a prolonged, graphic simulated sexual act with the hosts while wearing revealing underwear. The segment concluded with a discussion about who would receive the "Chair of Honor."

The final segment focused on a dispute over the "Chair of Honor" between Bobo and David from Israel.  This was interspersed with a chaotic storyline involving Opie's misplaced or stolen Mets tickets, escalating to their accidental destruction.  An impersonator of an IRS agent added to the absurdity by assessing a "gift tax" on the tickets.  The segment concluded with Bobo remaining chairless, Opie ticketless, and the hosts transitioning to the "Worst of the Week" countdown. The after-show discussion included Patty, who again refused to touch Bobo's penis.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  By the way, by the way, for the show.  For the show.  For the show.  For the show.  So I guess I'm going to this Mets game with Bobo tomorrow.  Are you really?  He just saw the look.  I was like, are you really?  And the face said it all.  By the way.  By the way.  I got an upgrade of the ticket.  It's one seat down and one over. 
[00:00:30]  By the way.  By the way, for the show.  I don't know.  I really think I got something to do in Philly tomorrow.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Family stuff.  Yeah, I do too.  I do too.  You got family stuff?  In Philly.  In Philly?  Why, is he trying to get you to go now?  No, but of course he would want anybody but for the show.  For the show.  For the show.  For the show.  I'm going to be a little distracted today because the British Open is on live.  I see that.  A little known fact, I really like watching golf, especially the majors.  It's so early. 
[00:01:00]  And good old Tom Watson just had a hole in one.  That was a good one.  Took a little bounce, went in.  One bounce.  One little bounce.  Nice.  Went in.  And then there's some kid.  He's an amateur.  Fucking amateur.  And he shot a 65 yesterday.  Yeah?  The lowest score for an amateur at the British Open since something happened over there.  I once shot an elephant in my pajamas.  How it got in my pajamas, I'll never know.  Oh, God.  That was Groucho? 
[00:01:30]  That was Groucho?  Yes.  He told me that right before he signed my paper and dropped dead.  What a hack.  Groucho was a hack.  Groucho was, but it was the time of hackdom.  Well, that's the funny part about it.  He wasn't a hack at the time.  No, the time.  That was great comedy.  That time would fuck you up and make you a hack.  Look at some stuff that's long gone now, and now it's hacky.  It's all hack.  But at the time, it wasn't hack.  No.  Now Tom Watson just did another thing.  A thing close to the thing?  Yeah, he's got another close thing that just happened. 
[00:02:00]  He put his little round thing next to the thing.  And then the thing happened.  I don't get guys that wear pink, man.  I got to say it right off the bat.  It's a power color.  Well, that's what they try to tell everybody else.  Yeah, it shows that you're confident with your masculinity.  Yeah, I think it shows that you're open to some possibilities.  Like something.  Maybe a golf ball or two.  A club handle.  I think it might be some kind of secret code that, look, I'm just saying I'm open to some  possibilities.  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[00:02:30]  If you're wearing pink and I'm wearing pink and no one's around.  Danny, I'll see you over by the tables.  Yeah.  I don't understand why the corporate douches decided pink is the power color.  It was probably just one douche guy.  One corporate douche guy came in one day.  Everyone started making fun of him.  And he's like, hey, dude.  Yeah.  I'm confident, man.  Yeah.  I'm confident.  Went into the meeting with the big boss.  Yeah.  Put his presentation out there.  Did a good job. 
[00:03:00]  Here's the Johnson file.  Yeah.  Well, the Penske file.  The Penske.  And then everybody was like, oh, wow, I got to start wearing pink.  Yeah.  The boss really took a liking to him.  If I wear pink, maybe the boss will think I'm him.  Well, let's find out who started the whole pink thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think it was some corporate douche.  You think?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Know what I hate about the British Open and then we can move on?  Yeah.  It's early.  If you know anything about golf, yeah, it's way too fucking early.  Their greens are as big as basically football fields. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, so it's easy to hit the green?  Yeah, so you could be on the green and be 50 yards away from the hole.  Wow.  What do you do there?  Do you got to...  I think I've seen guys every once in a while, they'll chip even though they're on the green.  What's that?  Oh, no.  No.  Not on the green.  You mean not use their putter?  They will use a little wedge or something?  Sometimes, yeah.  Sometimes.  Yeah?  Yeah, because the greens are really fucked up and really fucking big. 
[00:04:00]  It's really big.  Actually, I'm amazed that the weather is so nice there, but it's always windy.  Yeah.  You're always playing in the wind.  Yeah, I don't know why you would deal with that when you could live in America.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  Fuck that wind shit.  It's always raining and windy.  Yeah.  And I don't know why it's so prestigious because it looks like a shithole.  It does.  A lot of weeds.  A lot of weeds.  A long, tall grass.  It looks like the beginning of a cornfield is starting to grow in.  It hasn't been kempt.  No, not at all. 
[00:04:30]  Jimmy!  Morning, Jimmy.  Hi, guys.  It's Jimmy Norton.  Red-Eyed Jimmy.  Back from his L.A. adventure.  We were discussing golf.  The British Open.  The British Open is on.  Is on live right now.  Of course, golf without the L.  With no Tiger Woods.  No.  And my boy Rory McIlroy is kind of in the middle of the pack.  I was hoping he would have a better start.  Do you think maybe he'd have some momentum from the last one?  Well, I kind of like the kid.  Yeah?  Yeah, I like him.  Yeah, well.  It looks like Danny Newman. 
[00:05:00]  Noonan.  Noonan.  Noonan.  Noonan.  Noonan.  I corrected myself.  Noonan.  Noonan.  He does look like Noonan.  He looks like a cross between Danny Noonan and an angry bird.  Or the pig.  The pig and the angry bird?  Yeah.  He looks like a cross between that.  So.  Bird noises.  Hey, is there a...  Makes me want to take a dump, because I always play on the bowl.  Oh, really?  So whenever I hear it, it's like Pavlov's asshole.  I just sit here and...  I nap with my kid a lot of days after the show, and he fucking sleeps way more than 
[00:05:30]  I do, and I'm laying in bed like bored, so I'll do my angry birds in bed.  Yeah.  As the little fucker's sleeping next to me.  That's a fun little game still.  Yeah.  Is there another one?  I think there is.  What's the new one?  What's the latest one that came out?  I didn't update.  The newest one that came out.  I got all the stars and the eggs.  I need a new one.  I need a new board.  I need a new season.  They're, believe me, they're pumping them out. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  They are pumping them out.  Are they making them harder?  I think it's the same game.  I think they're adding some things in.  But I think they can make them more puzzly.  You know what I mean?  Like how?  There's a lot of just...  Some of them are pretty hard.  Nah, not really.  Nah, you know.  Some of them...  The first time you throw your birds at them, you're like, fuck, I need more birds.  Yeah.  And then, like...  There's a little strategy, but I'm talking about where you need to...  That first bird has to hit that one fucking speck on the board. 
[00:06:30]  Sometimes that's it.  Not really, man.  I don't know.  I'm waiting for that.  And I don't think they want to fuck with success, you know?  True.  If they start fucking around with it a little too much...  You know, you like figuring out puzzles, though, right?  Oh, yeah.  I think that would be cool if they threw a little more of that in there.  Yeah.  Just a little bit.  A little bit.  And then the fact that...  Instead of having that big, black, asshole bird that knocks over everything.  Yeah.  Just everything.  That is great.  The atomic bomb bird where it goes in.  I like placing the exploding bird somewhere. 
[00:07:00]  Like, you place it.  You wait for it to fall through something.  And then you explode it.  Uh-huh.  Like, everything just fucking flies apart.  I never hit the bomb.  Oh, that's a good one.  Because I need to be challenged.  Yeah?  I never hit the bomb.  I let it blow up by itself.  Oh, no, no.  I always bang it.  Like, there it is.  It's in perfect position.  Bam!  Well, yeah, with the boomerang birds.  Fucking hate those things.  I use them as the boomerang birds probably 50% of the time. 
[00:07:30]  Nah.  The other 50, I just throw them into this shit.  Yeah, I just throw them forward.  Sometimes you have to, though.  Sometimes you gotta whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  Because you gotta hit the thing from the back.  But then when you hit it to turn around and you hit it too early and then it flies over  everything, you're like, what the fuck?  That's annoying as piss, man.  It really is.  That really is.  I don't think...  You know what technology has gotten us?  Huh?  The fact that you're in the bathroom, the door is closed, and if somebody's living with  you, they hear, like, motherfucker from the bathroom.  This is shit you wouldn't hear unless you had, like, explosive diarrhea. 
[00:08:00]  You're like, ow!  Fuck!  Yeah, in the old days, that would mean blood in your schools.  Yeah, yeah.  Now it means you couldn't get your boomerang bird to hit properly.  Yeah, now you're just like, come on, fucker!  Spin!  I know what's weird, too.  Video games were developing, developing, developing, and now we all care about just basic fucking...  Little things.  Little dumb video games again.  Yeah, little games.  Isn't that weird?  Yeah, it went to the point where it was like, wow, major league graphics, fucking giant games,  very expansive environments, and to, yeah, just fucking show me a little building with 
[00:08:30]  some pigs in it, and I'll throw some birds at it.  True.  Do you play Cut the Rope?  I have played Cut the Rope.  Is it good?  That's pretty cool.  People are starting to talk about that one in my circles.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that one's been around for a little while.  No, I know, but it's fun.  Do you like it?  Yeah, you gotta, like, let the thing swing, Cut the Rope at the right time.  My brother swears by it.  He loves it.  Yeah.  And he was an Angry Birds fan, so I don't know.  I'm so distracted by the lovely Mrs. Imus with the hat. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, she's gotta...  Like, she's gotta lose the fucking cowboy hat.  Of course she has to.  Why is she wearing the cowboy hat all the time?  I understand when Imus puts it on.  Probably.  Lately, he hasn't.  He's been showing his amazing head of fucking hair that he's got there.  She probably has a lot of lumps from Imus hitting her or something.  Do you think Imus is beating her?  So she's hiding all the lumps with the cowboy hat.  Oh, damn fucking shit.  Either that or she insulted his cowboy stuff.  Like, she got sick of it one time.  She lives in a fucking penthouse in Manhattan. 
[00:09:30]  She's like, enough with the cowboy shit.  You look like an asshole.  And it really hurt his feelings.  So now she's just to show she's on board by wearing the cowboy hat.  Like, oh no, I love it.  I was kidding.  You know, I enjoy the hats and the boots and everything.  I don't know why I gotta say that.  Why you hurt me like that.  And then he...  She puts it on.  You have to overcompensate for humiliating him.  But he used to wear the cowboy hats.  Yeah.  He has no hat on.  No.  Who gives a fuck about her and him when you have that hot news broad that we're all obsessed with?  The one that's...  And Mars told me that she's Portuguese. 
[00:10:00]  Portuguese?  Mars did some research for us.  That's even better.  Good.  Portuguese.  We learned she's Portuguese.  She was on American Idol.  She could sing, obviously.  She sang yesterday on I Missed's show.  And she drank with Joe DeRosa until 4 a.m.  So that means she's open to possibilities.  Unfortunately, she's not a good job.  Not for Joe, though.  She wants a guy with shoulders.  Joe asked her out.  Who?  This girl.  Oh, you'll see.  Yeah, we'll point her out.  She's on Fox Business. 
[00:10:30]  What did you do, Red Eye with her?  Yeah.  So I guess they went out afterwards, as usual.  I was saying Fox is the biggest load of drunks.  They're all Aussies.  Fox is the drunkest network I've ever been on.  That's how Murdoch missed the fucking scandal overseas.  Yeah.  Phone tapping is loaded.  He was hammered.  That whole network is drunk.  And he was out with her until like, you know, 4 in the morning.  Yeah.  And asked her out.  And she went, no, I don't date.  It's like, oh, God.  I don't date.  I go, Joe, she doesn't date you.  Exactly. 
[00:11:00]  She didn't want you because if you make it to 4 a.m. with a girl, you're getting laid.  Yeah.  Something's happening.  Of course you are.  Something's happening.  But she's, yeah, she's very hot.  I bet you what happened was she bet her friends that she could meet a guy who looks like Carmine  Ragusa and get him to ask her out and humiliate him.  Once she won the bet, it was over.  She was probably waiting the whole time for a text message to come in and never came in.  Right.  And she was killing time with stupid.  Stupid.  I was going to say stupid.  Oh, God.  Do you think that's what he was?  Just a temporary fucking. 
[00:11:30]  Just a shill sitting there waiting.  Speaking of stupid.  And his Twitter is Joe DeRosa comedy.  Oh.  He fucked up my payback on Bob Kelly yesterday.  Stupid fucked it up.  I watched the video and, boy, it was like watching a movie that you're like, oh, this  is going to be good.  Yeah.  And then the ending doesn't pan out.  Well, we look like blundering fools.  But basically, really fast, I guess it was late last week, Bob Kelly did the show. 
[00:12:00]  Or was it this week?  I don't know.  I'm losing track of it.  It was earlier in the week.  Earlier this week.  And Jimmy was sort of involved with the big scare video, right?  I was right by.  I was there when Bob conceptualized it.  Yeah.  So Jimmy and Bob Kelly.  It was Bob's idea.  Were following me out of the building.  I did not know this.  Yeah.  Anthony knew because he didn't take off like he usually does, leaving a cartoon trail.  Oh, man.  I can't fucking leave the front of this building fast enough.  So I should have known something was up because you were kind of like mingling.  Yes.  I was sitting in my vehicle.  And then I'm walking down the sidewalk and Bob Kelly came up from behind me and scared the 
[00:12:30]  shit out of me.  Video is doing well.  And it was pretty funny, whatever.  So I said, fuck that.  Payback's going to be a bitch.  So Joe DeRosa did the show yesterday, filling in for Jimmy.  And after the show, I was walking the same way as Joe.  And we just happened.  I swear to God, because people think it's a setup.  I fucking hate people.  I really do.  I fucking hate the idiots.  Oh, they thought it was a setup.  A few people do.  And it's just like, you just shut up and go away.  You're idiots.  So I'm walking with Joe DeRosa in Bob Kelly's neighborhood. 
[00:13:00]  Jimmy knows.  And all of a sudden, we turn the corner and there's Bob Kelly's wife.  That's handy.  So we talked to her for a couple of minutes.  There she is, by the way.  Yeah.  What's her name?  Oh, shit.  Diane something.  Yeah.  They gave it to us yesterday.  Diane McCure or something like that?  I never did it with her.  I haven't either.  I haven't seen her on Red Eye.  She smoked.  I would remember that.  So I talked to Bob Kelly's wife for a couple of minutes.  And then I'm like, is Bobby home? 
[00:13:30]  Because I know we're just a few blocks away.  She goes, yeah.  I'm running errands.  I'm like, can we have the keys?  She goes, yeah.  No problem.  So we get her on video saying she allowed this.  And then I asked her a million times, do you guys own any guns?  Do you own any knives?  What's your plan if someone breaks in?  Because now we're going to open the door and scare the shit out of Bobby.  I'm going to get him back for the video that Jimmy was part of.  It's a home invasion.  Yeah.  It's a home invasion.  So she's like, nah, he's going to be sitting right in.  As soon as you open the door, he'll be right there.  It's perfect. 
[00:14:00]  Here's the keys.  Like I get hit with some cum in the face.  Right.  Have fun.  Blah, blah, blah.  So me and Joe grab the keys and we walk over there.  I set up the video and all.  And we walk in.  And now, well, whatever.  I guess I could give away.  Who gives a fuck?  Then you can see the video.  So then we're in the hallway.  And I'm thinking like any good movie, we're going to discuss our plan outside the door.  Right.  I'm thinking a good fucking, you know, buddy comedy.  We're going to discuss something.  Dude, I'll give you the scene.  Pulp Fiction.  Right before they go in to get the case.  Okay. 
[00:14:30]  Fucking, yeah.  John Travolta and fucking Jules out there talking by the door.  Yeah.  Before they go in.  Yeah.  Put your game face on.  Yeah.  Well, stupid, who has the keys.  We go in the building.  I don't know where his apartment is.  Next thing I know, we're outside his door.  And I'm thinking, okay.  I see him put something down.  So I'm thinking, okay, now we're going to discuss our plan.  Bob Kelly's right inside the door.  All of a sudden, he just does the keys loudly and bursts in with this weak, ah! 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, yeah.  He was too loud with the key, first of all.  Right.  So Bobby knew someone was coming in the door, so you weren't going to catch him doing anything.  And then his attention was at the door, so he instantly sees someone he knows.  Yeah.  So that didn't, like, fuck him up.  Well, I'm thinking, all right, outside the door.  He sees DeRosa.  He knows.  Maybe we could start a little commotion outside the door.  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe a couple knocks or something.  You know, get his suspicion up a little bit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:15:30]  Work it.  Instead of loud keys, which would sound like his wife.  His wife.  Because who else has keys to his apartment?  And that's what he said.  He thought his wife was coming in.  And then Joe bursts in, and yeah, Bob's sitting there, but he has the weakest, and Bob Kelly  was sort of scared.  And the only reason he was scared, by the way, I have deciphered this, he swears he wasn't  looking at porn.  That motherfucker was already looking at porn.  He was ready to jerk off.  And if you look at the video, you could see this guy closing boxes like I've never seen  anyone closing boxes.  Click, click, click.  Look at the video again. 
[00:16:00]  He was a little scared because he goes, holy shit, they almost saw what I was looking at.  That's what I'm thinking now.  Oh, and God only knows what awful porn it is.  Oh, fat guy tranny porn.  Our whole goal was to catch him jerking off.  Yeah.  Because you know, as soon as his wife left, he was going to at some point, right?  Yeah, you might have been able to.  But that stupid Joe DeRosa fucked up my payback video.  Yeah.  So you can check it out.  I tweeted it.  It's one of my, I don't know, one of the last tweets I did. 
[00:16:30]  I was hoping to see something transpire there.  OP radio.  Well, I'm going to have to do it again now.  Wow.  So.  You were going to open the door.  I'd.  Start from.  Start from the setup a little bit.  Oh, Joe.  We'll see if this plays on the radio.  Oh, we almost got to put that shot.  And it would have been rightfully so with the evil thing that we're about to fucking  do here.  We got the keys from his wife.  We randomly ran into the door.  She gave us the keys.  Yeah.  So we could sneak in and scare the piss out. 
[00:17:00]  Joe.  I'm a little nervous.  So here's Joe.  We're going in the front of the building.  We're outside the door now.  I'm like, okay, let's, let's discuss this.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Then I realized I don't think we're going to discuss anything.  Hey, motherfucker.  He goes, hey, motherfucker.  Dude, you can't.  Look at him.  Oh, my God.  He's going crazy.  He's going crazy. 
[00:17:30]  Your wife gave me the key.  Wait, you're a little scared.  Dude, he's going crazy shutting windows.  She did.  He is.  Why wouldn't he just sit back and leave whatever was on his computer on it?  Because there's a lot of tranny stuff over there.  Right, right, right.  What you see is.  Dude, he, if that happened to anybody else and there was nothing bad on your computer.  Yeah.  You would just go like, you'd lean back in your chair and go, you fucking assholes.  Or something.  His, his finger is going whoosh, whoosh, click, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, click, whoosh. 
[00:18:00]  Looks like his fingers are ice skating across the fucking head.  Yes.  He couldn't shut those with, and a lot of them.  He's holding his, he's holding his chest with his left hand, so that means he got scared a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, not enough to, to, for the big payback.  And then, the right hand is working like he's done this a million fucking times.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He had, he's had to close windows very quickly.  And then when he closed all the windows that he didn't want us to see, then he sits back.  Yeah, yeah.  And addresses the situation. 
[00:18:30]  He's not even looking at the camera, he's looking at the windows.  Look, look, look, look.  Where he can shut things.  Danny's trying to, trying to zoom in and see what the fuck it is.  Ha, ha.  Yeah.  Oh, I hope we don't out Bob Kelly by mistake.  Bob's gay.  Just some hardcore gay pornography.  He's got a big rod.  Steam ass.  Yeah, we could have maybe got some props, something.  Yeah.  We don't have to play the rest of the video.  You can check it out for yourself.  That's fucking great, Bobby.  I think it came out pretty well. 
[00:19:00]  You can, you can see it for yourself.  I'll retweet it again this morning.  Big rod.  But, uh, and then people fucking trying to make fun of Bobby's apartment.  What?  And it's like.  Bobby's got a great apartment.  A great place.  Exactly.  And I, I purposely only showed a tiny bit of his apartment because, you know, it's, it's  where he lives.  And I don't know if he wants that all over the place.  Yeah.  The place is really big and nice.  People are like, oh, you live in a shoe bar.  Without even knowing how, how big the apartment is or getting a tour of the place.  Not knowing New York City also. 
[00:19:30]  Right.  God.  That would have been great if he had one of those moments.  Doesn't anyone fucking knock anymore?  Then he explains he was really close to.  To jacking.  To jacking it.  And then he does weird shit with his dog.  And it's all in the video.  And then he's got weird art.  He starts singing with his dog.  Art on the walls.  And the dog is going.  That was funny.  I like seeing a little Bobby at home like that.  That was a, that was a funny day.  Oh, yeah.  Left click.  Left click.  Left click.  Right click. 
[00:20:00]  Up, down.  Double click.  So I can save that page.  Danny, play it from, play it from, uh, uh, the part where he's listening to his wife.  A little further in the beginning.  I'm sorry.  Oh, where you give the, um.  Yeah, try, uh, not, well, all right, yeah.  You give the camcorder to him.  Well, we taped his wife giving us the okay.  Yeah, permission.  Yeah.  You saw the video of Bobby.  Ah, that's all right.  Come on, motherfucker.  Oh, yeah.  A little further back from here.  There it is. 
[00:20:30]  Yes, it just started from there.  I'm going to fucking knock her out when she comes home.  She gave Joe DeRosa a set of keys to my house?  Yeah.  Hope he too.  We were really hoping that you were in the middle of jerking off because she went for a quick, uh,  errand run.  Right now, by the way, pause that.  What he's doing, he has his left hand on the back of the fucking laptop.  And he's trying to move it forward.  He's trying to move it forward.  And he's ready to slam it closed if he has to.  Right.  If he has to, Bob will just slam it closed.  You're absolutely right.  Why is your hand on the fucking computer, dude?  He minimized windows. 
[00:21:00]  He didn't close windows.  Yeah.  He wanted to get back to where he was eventually.  Yeah.  So he minimized.  Because it took a while to get where he was.  Yeah.  So he's ready to slam the laptop closed.  If he has to.  If he has to.  Because if he couldn't get them all, just go back and see him and watch his hands.  Right now, there's a nice, pristine white screen, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  There's nothing on that screen.  It's like, what, are you looking up snow on the internet?  Yeah.  He's got his desktop.  That's what you're saying.  He googled the perfect neighborhood, and that came up.  He's protecting that laptop because he might be paranoid we're going to grab it and run. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  There's a lot going on with that laptop.  Oh, my God.  You just watch his left hand go to the screen.  Yeah.  This is great.  House.  Yeah.  Hope it to.  We're really hoping that you're in the middle of jerking off because you went through it.  He's leaning forward.  He told it.  What a fucking traitor. 
[00:22:00]  That's where we're at?  So.  I guess so.  It's a shame, you know.  Just hit you over the fucking knees.  But then he panicked on me.  Honestly, God, this is where I'd be.  You would make a horrible cat burglar.  This is where I'd be.  I would be terrible at it.  No, I'd be a great cat.  No, you.  Fuck, man.  I didn't even know what you were doing.  You were probably three to eight minutes away. 
[00:22:30]  For me, honestly.  Yeah.  Fucking.  I'd have my cock out here and some type of awful.  It would have been awful.  Can we pause this?  If he was jerking off, he would have.  Jimmy, in your honest opinion, he was already looking at shit, right?  Yeah, of course he was.  And he even admitted.  He goes, you almost caught me jerking off to awful.  He goes awful.  Right.  So he did have some shit up there.  But then he explains his routine, and he said he was watching MMA videos.  And he knows we're not going to buy that. 
[00:23:00]  If he's jerking off to that.  But he says he starts with MMA videos, and then he moves on to something else.  He gives the whole scenario.  Man on man asshole.  But he was way past MMA videos when we broke in or whatever.  Panic either way with his wife coming through the door.  Well, that's what I thought if we hit him early that he would jerk off right away if she just left.  Yeah.  And the sad part is, my dog would probably be right here.  The dogs didn't even bark when we came in. 
[00:23:30]  Nothing.  Nobody flinched.  Because you blew it.  I didn't even know what we were doing.  You really blew it.  Outside the door, you should have said, he's going to be right inside there.  What do you want to do?  I thought you knew.  I thought you were going to open the door.  I'd run in with the camera.  Can I show this on film?  It's an Israeli chick.  No, see, it's a guy.  Those are hips.  Guys don't have those.  Joe doesn't have hips.  He doesn't have fucking shoulders.  And he has no concept of what we were trying to do.  This is cock sucker.  Why are you calling?  What?  No, but what did you say when you came in? 
[00:24:00]  Immediately under the bus.  It was a little dog.  Immediately.  It doesn't work.  I'm supposed to get him back for scaring the shit out of me.  And you blew my one up.  How much cum has that dog had to clean up?  That dog has lacked a lot of cum off the top of Bob's shoes.  He's out of his sneakers.  What was the plan, really?  What was the plan?  There was no plan, Bobby, is the answer.  All of a sudden, he's like.  Not me a little.  But I wouldn't know because I don't have it on camera.  That was bugger.  What's it look like?  I wouldn't know. 
[00:24:30]  He's singing with his dog.  Stop.  It's not.  Shut up.  It's crying.  It's singing, Joe.  It's singing.  It's crying.  Give me my dog, you fucking girl.  Oh, God.  It sounds horrible.  Then she'll start singing.  You got to let her.  You keep her walking, right?  Bob Lipson.  A weird existence.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[00:25:00]  Oh.  Let's go get coffee.  Yes.  Because he knows when Bobby makes that noise, it's mealtime.  She knows cum snack is coming.  She knows to get, like when Bob makes, oh, she gets down by his fucking shoes and ankles.  Because she knows a big cum treat is going to be delivered.  And she knows the computer thing is going to be slammed shut.  And all male voices are going to stop immediately when he cums.  You notice he's ashamed.  You notice he finally got comfortable enough to get up off the table. 
[00:25:30]  Sure.  Yeah.  From the table, excuse me, and leave his laptop alone.  Yeah.  And then kind of have fun with us a little bit.  And then he's sitting back with his dog, making his dog sing, because he knows the threat  is over now.  Making his Bobby Cumsey sounds.  And his dog is like begging for it.  Yeah.  The dog sits up and begs us to turn out and sometimes, Bob will aim for the tongue just  to prevent, like, a big cleanup problem.  So no one slips on it when they walk in the door.  It goes right in the dog's mouth. 
[00:26:00]  The dog doesn't know how wrong it is.  No.  The dog notices that Bob's avoid eye contact after.  There's a little bit of bad vibes in the house.  Very embarrassing.  The threat is confused there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You see the shock in his face, like, oh, fuck, you scared me.  But no, the real threat was, we almost caught what he had on his laptop.  What he had.  It came out all right, but fuck.  I don't know.  Joe DeRosa fucked it up.  We had a perfect scenario. 
[00:26:30]  Perfect in that case.  Yeah.  And then a lot of people were like, why don't you try that at Anthony's house?  I saw that.  Yeah.  Why don't you go there and do the same thing?  That's why I see you through the window.  You're like, I would be stupid enough to go to Anthony's house and try that same trick.  Get the fuck out of here.  Great video of DeRosa's head exploding with a .45 hollow point would have been nice.  So you could slow motion.  Slow motion that one, please.  That would always be a good video under any circumstances.  See that nice red mist out of his exploding head. 
[00:27:00]  I would be sad for maybe an hour and then go, wow, how do I get this online?  Yeah, it's going to be huge.  This one's going to go viral.  Finally, I got a viral video.  Hey, shit.  Yeah, that's...  Jimmy, how was the ESPYs?  A bunch of tweets came in that you killed.  Thank you.  I didn't see it yet.  I was surprised.  I was very nervous about this piece.  I had no faith.  Because athletes suck, right?  No, they were fine. 
[00:27:30]  I just didn't...  I saw it in rehearsal.  And it did...  Oh.  In the rehearsal.  And usually that's a good indicator.  There were some big laughs.  And we made a couple of little switches and changes in the edit bay.  Just reversed a couple things.  Wow.  And it killed in the...  I was very happy with the way it played.  Isn't that amazing how you could do that?  Just switch a couple little things around.  It just...  It keeps the energy going.  And I was...  Because Rickles was the lead guest, so I mean, I was...  You meet him?  Oh, I've already met him.  Oh, yeah.  The pictures were great.  I've already met him, but I got him to sign the photo, and I went into the dressing room 
[00:28:00]  and I talked to him before, and he was...  When I came off stage, you know how when you leave the stage, because I don't stay out  there, because I'm between the monologue and first guest, so I came off, and Rickles  was sitting there just waiting to go out, so he had seen the whole piece, and he's like,  God, that was great, Jim.  That was great.  And he talked to me for a minute, and then...  Oh, that's bull.  He was fucking hilarious, because Jay introduced me as the bastard son of Donald Rickles,  and then at the end, I do promo shots, which you guys don't see, because they're showing, 
[00:28:30]  I think, in California.  Right.  You were hoping you were going to be on stage with Rickles, were you?  At the very, very end, but you'll never see it.  I was just...  It was just for promos for local news stations.  Yeah, I got you.  But I was, and he was so fucking sweet.  Oh, he was so great.  Yeah, he was hugging me, and oh, he was...  I was so happy.  His bitches look great.  Is he a nice guy?  Phenomenal.  When he's not being a sarcastic son of a bitch?  Dude, he was great.  He's such a great guy.  He just...  He was very loving.  He smelled good, too.  Like, Don Rickles smells rich. 
[00:29:00]  Like, he really did.  Really?  How old is he?  He's in his 80s.  I'd love to know when he was born.  I'm going to guess 1930.  Wow.  Wow, yeah, yeah.  But that was...  Bristol Palin was the other guest.  She was nice.  I fucking love Rickles.  I do, too.  And he was really genuinely nice to me.  What year was he born?  1926.  26.  He's 85 years old.  He's 85 years old.  And he was funny, man.  He was funny.  He's like...  Does he walk around like he's 85?  No, he doesn't.  I think he likes to sift, you know. 
[00:29:30]  And they actually debated bringing me out while he was on panel, which I look like him,  and sitting me next to him while he talked to Jay.  But they just...  Because he was on a roll, they just didn't want to...  Which was smart.  They shouldn't have.  You don't interrupt the guy when he's back and forth.  Wow, man.  But he was fucking funny.  He just kept...  Like, Jay said something.  He's like, I just said that.  What are you, dumb?  I just love how fucking nasty he is.  It's very nasty.  Oh, he's a funny guy, man.  That's cool.  So, yeah.  It went really well.  The athletes were all...  We got some good ones.  We got a lot of the guys from the... 
[00:30:00]  Did he get Michael Irvin?  Yeah.  He kissed me on the head.  Did he?  Kissed me.  Yeah, he was great.  What a mo.  Well.  Oh, his brother.  Really?  Isn't that the one that was just in the paper?  Yeah.  Talking about his brother a little bit.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah, I think...  Oh, my God.  I hope it's Irvin's brother.  Somebody help me out.  Whoops.  And then said something like, sports in general are ready to accept gay athletes.  Wasn't that Irvin?  Oh, I don't know.  The other day? 
[00:30:30]  Oh, boy.  Ant, look down, please.  That's a big ye.  Anyone?  I got to get that one right.  I don't know.  Irvin?  All right.  Most of the athletes stopped and were very talkative.  Yeah.  A lot of them we couldn't use because of time, but I mean, they were all cool.  Some of the actors, like Justin Bieber came in.  He didn't stop for any.  He couldn't.  He just waved and whatever.  And then Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds wouldn't come over.  I was kind of annoyed at that.  They're going to be in that horseshit movie, what is it, Change?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Change Up? 
[00:31:00]  Whatever the fuck.  Oh, God.  We were just talking about that the other day.  Awful.  Yes.  They're going to switch roles.  Yes.  Are you?  It's the war.  The married guy is going to be the single guy.  The single guy is going to be the married guy.  How many times are they going to do that movie?  Once again, I'll say it.  There's a morality in Hollywood, so the married guy will absolutely not fuck as the single guy.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Even though this is make-believe world.  Right.  Because there's a wife involved, and it's morality. 
[00:31:30]  It's like, just do the movie if you're going to do it.  Have a married guy fuck all the sluts.  And he had the single guy with the other guy's wife, and he wasn't fucking her because  she had diarrhea or some shit.  But the single guy should now, you know, fuck the married guy's wife because now he's  the husband.  He's in the body of the husband.  So just do it.  Who cares?  I don't understand why they don't do that.  Who can we talk to about it?  It would be great if he was like, wow, she likes it in the ass.  It's like, she got really dirty, and she started exploring with the new one. 
[00:32:00]  Of course.  He starts telling the guy what kind of a whore his wife is.  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  Hey, was Al Sharpton really on your flight?  Sat in front of me.  Reverend Al?  He sat literally right in the seat in front of me.  Did he tell us to him?  First class, huh?  Yeah.  Reverend Al flies first class?  Yeah.  Yeah, of course he does.  And that's an expensive first class.  Nice.  Taking all that money he's getting from his fucking church, whatever that is, and he's  flying first class.  Hypocrite.  What a motherfucker. 
[00:32:30]  Everyone is up.  Give me a break.  Yeah.  Did you have a little conversation with him?  No.  When he got on, he looked at me.  He didn't recognize me.  He just was putting his bag up.  I went, hey, Reverend Al.  And he went, hey.  I said, how are you?  He said, hello.  That was it.  Yeah.  And I did tweet about it, but I waited until I get off the flight, because I had a line  I wanted to do, but I'm like, you can't do that before the plane takes long.  I saw that tweet.  Before the plane take, you can't do it?  Yeah.  A long flight?  I saw your tweet.  Yeah, you don't need, anything like that with Twitter, with the fucking plane.  Can you read it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But you just can't do it before the plane. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  What was Jimmy's tweet exactly?  I said, Al Sharpton sat on the plane in front of me.  It's the first time I ever prayed for my own flight to crash.  But you can't do that before the fucking plane.  Right, right, yes.  You just don't want any weird.  Security and shit, yeah.  That's hilarious.  Thank you.  That's a funny fucking tweet, man.  Sally Field was on my flight going out, too.  I really wanted the picture with her, but she's going to go right.  How'd she look?  She looked good, man.  She looked really fun. 
[00:33:30]  And you know, she was two C's to my right, and two C's to my left was Kira Sedgwick, who  was fucking, looked good, man.  Oh, she's hot, man.  Oh, she kept picking her, she kept bringing her bag down, and she would squat down to get her  bag, and she had, like, this little fucking...  She goes, stop doing that.  Yeah, come on.  Your ass is showing.  Oh, she has a fucking nice body, man.  Yeah.  Oof.  And we saw her once.  Oh, she was here a lot, actually.  That was one where I tweeted that one, where it was like, oh, it's the flying nun and the  flying N-O-N-E, nun, for you.  That's a good one. 
[00:34:00]  She said the flying nunnery or something.  I love word.  I love wordplay.  Wordplay.  Wordplay, nun.  The flying nun.  Bob Kelly is on the line.  Bobby.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, Bob.  I like your morning voice.  Smokey, sexy voice.  I like that voice.  No, no.  Let me tell you something, dude.  Dude.  Let me tell you something, dude.  Dude.  We got some observations on that video, Bobby, now that it's been a while.  Yes.  Yes, Jimmy pointed out, and a few other people pointed out, you were not scared whatsoever 
[00:34:30]  when me and Joe burst through your front door.  What you were scared about was the fact that we might get a shot of what you were actually  looking at on your laptop.  You were closing or minimizing windows at a fucking panic speed.  You can see in the video, your finger is just swiping the fucking computer.  You're clicking.  Wait a second, wait a second, wait a second, wait a second, wait a second, wait a second.  Like a pit crew at a...  Yeah, yeah, it was like an indie pit crew.  Right.  Your fingers were lightly dancing across that fucking... 
[00:35:00]  Foot's close, foot's close, foot's close, foot's close.  And then at one point, you put your hand on the back of the computer, of the laptop,  like at any moment, you're just going to slam it shut.  That was the last move you had in your arsenal.  Yeah.  I was going to snap that screen in half, if you've done anything.  We can only imagine the filth that was on there.  What creep CSI private investigator did you hire to figure that out? 
[00:35:30]  Well, Jimmy noticed it, and a bunch of people that checked out the video noticed it.  Your fingers are dancing.  Yeah, you really were shutting windows.  And then you finally, when you minimized all the windows you needed to, then you sat back  and addressed us and what just happened.  After all the man-on-man shit was closed.  The dead giveaway was that two guys burst into your place like that, you look at them for  two seconds, then you don't make eye contact, you're just concentrating on your screen and 
[00:36:00]  shutting things.  What about the oily finger that was just in my ass?  Oily.  Did I shake your hand?  Oily finger.  And we're convinced that your dog makes that sound when you're going, oh, oh, oh, because  you make that sound when you cum, and the dog knows it's got to lick it up.  That's it.  Diva knows a snack is arriving soon.  That snack.  That's the same as opening up the cookie treat jar in a fucking song playing. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, oh, and the dog's like, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah, you're just making that oh, oh, oh sound.  The dog is just thinking bleachy treats, bleachy treats.  You're going to train it somehow.  And we said how Diva will go to your ankles and feet because you probably cum right down  your leg.  Just glurk.  Yeah.  With blurka, blurka.  Blurka, blurka, and she'll lick the cum out of your laces. 
[00:37:00]  Fucking sitting there with your pants around your ankles and bowling shoes on.  Holy shit.  Licking gum out of your fucking bowling shoelaces.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, I love that.  Whoever observed that, you may be right.  Yeah.  But that proves that you're a normal guy, Ope.  Why?  Because you didn't even pick up on that.  You're a nice human being.  You don't have a deviant phone in your body. 
[00:37:30]  No, I kind of knew something might be going on with that laptop.  Something could have been up.  I'm not stupid.  That little finger was in a fucking time warp.  You really were.  Yeah.  I'd hate to be your fingers.  Oh, God.  They go from such bad places to such good places, too.  It's like for most of the day, they're in ice cream and cake.  But when it's bad, it's really bad.  Fucking DeRosa blew my pay back there, Bobby. 
[00:38:00]  Jesus Christ.  DeRosa stinks at scaring people.  You said in the video how he doesn't have that scary...  No, he's just like, hey, motherfucker!  He's like the host of a kid's show.  Yeah.  Hey!  Hey!  And then a lot of people want to beat you up for where you live.  And I'm like, hey, idiots, you didn't even see the apartment.  Bob is a really cool place.  Yeah, I purposely didn't film the apartment.  Two stories.  Yeah. 
[00:38:30]  Hey, by the way, I've been enjoying playing online chess with Bob.  Oh, yeah?  And you said your wife was doing an impression?  Oh, you're fucking...  She's doing chip now.  Oh, God, how annoying.  Oh, that's terrible.  We were driving home the other day.  I was lost in Jersey.  Off the turnpike, I went up at this awful truck stop that I didn't even know existed.  I'm sure you did.  Yeah.  She's like, why don't you turn into the service and get some service? 
[00:39:00]  Oh, that's terrible.  Were you annoyed?  I almost fucking left it there with a truck driver.  Dude, my fingers are in the best and worst places.  They really are.  It's like his other fingers see them in peach cobbler and fucking cake all the time and get jealous.  And they're like, you don't understand.  When you guys leave and we're alone, it's going to be a dark, ugly fucking evening.  He buries us in his asshole. 
[00:39:30]  Really?  His age?  Yes.  Two or three at a time.  He digs for a piece of non-existent toilet paper.  He just scratches and itches.  And the nails are like, we can back that up.  That's awful.  Yeah.  He's a matchbook to get the crap out of my fingernails.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Your fingers are fucking miserable compared to other people's fingers.  I bet you Bob wakes up and his fucking fingers have crab walked him to the bathroom and they're 
[00:40:00]  just soaking in soapy water.  He has no idea that his hands have just turned the sink on and put soap in there.  His hands have minds of their own.  They're tired of it.  His fucking fingers are tired of it.  They actually watch that scene in Escape from Alcatraz when the hatchet chops the fingers  off and they get jealous.  They're like, how do we talk him into doing that?  Well, you were very close.  You were very close to getting a really good video. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  Well, then we would have had a discussion.  That video was good?  I'm sure we would have had a discussion, though, after the camera went off.  Dude, you can't help me.  I'm married.  Dude, come on, dude.  She suspects I like this stuff, but she doesn't know.  I was just doing some research, dude.  Yeah.  It would have been the scene in The Godfather at the wedding.  I would have grabbed your camera and smashed it.  Yeah.  They're on a couple of bucks on the floor.  I have to ask, because your wife set you up there.  It's in the video. 
[00:41:00]  What was said when she got home?  I haven't seen her since yesterday.  No, come on.  No.  I just called her a fucking traitor, bitch.  Yeah.  But she was laughing.  And she thought it was hilarious that you guys brought it.  It would have been hilarious if she actually found out what I was looking at.  We'll see if she was laughing then.  Yeah.  We tried looking at the screen, like freeze-framing some of the video.  We're doing some CSI shit this morning.  But you covered up pretty well. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was pretty bad.  That left hand was ready to slam that laptop shut.  It sure was.  I think you were going to run for it with the laptop.  I have it set up to where, like, one finger, I can usually swipe it up and swipe it to the left or swipe it to the right corner.  Everything goes away or shut everything down.  For some reason, everything just didn't work.  I don't like it.  I don't like it if you just dumped your coffee into your keyboard. 
[00:42:00]  Like, fuck it.  I'm going to just buy a new one.  Your fingers look like the fucking soldiers in war games trying to shut down a whopper.  But the beauty of the whole thing, too, is he's really quick with that right hand.  But he's also trying to make it look casual.  Yeah.  So he's talking.  I don't know how you do that.  Yeah, his eyes are saying one thing.  His eyes are going, hey, guys, you almost got me.  His fingers are going, panic, panic, panic, gay videos, panic, panic, panic, panic, panic, gay videos, panic, tranny, panic, panic, panic, nude children, panic, panic, panic. 
[00:42:30]  Those are just the voices in your head.  All right, guys, I'm doing the weather on PIX this morning, Channel 11.  Oh, you really are?  Yeah, turn it on the TV.  I'm doing the weather.  Put the TV down.  How did you get that?  I have the worst publicist in the world.  When are you doing the weather?  I'd love to do the weather.  What time are you doing the weather?  Uh, a nine o'clock. 
[00:43:00]  I would love to be able to do that.  That's a while away.  All right.  Say how to Jill.  Is that who it is?  No, she does the traffic.  She does traffic, but that's her channel, though.  Yeah, if she's there, you'll see her.  No wonder I can't get it.  Oh.  You guys are friends again, right?  Yeah, she's all right.  I got no problems.  There's no problems here.  There's no problems.  There's no problems here.  Yes.  Hey, go ahead.  Do it whether you have fun or not doing the weather.  Weather the weather. 
[00:43:30]  Get it?  We're going to go.  Chip, goodbye.  All right, Bobby.  Bob Kelly, everyone.  I'm so happy his wife is still in chip.  Oh, God.  How annoying.  How annoying.  This is a great question.  How many times has Bobby practiced shutting the computer down if his wife came home?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  His movement was like, I got this down.  I practice this every day.  He's right there by the front door.  I know.  Jerk off downstairs.  Come on.  Come on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And set a trap upstairs. 
[00:44:00]  You know why he'll do it?  So when that door opens, something happens.  Put baby oil on the fucking floor so she slips and cracks her head.  She breaks her femur.  You have time to fucking close the computer.  You know what it is?  I know Bobby's layout.  He's on a ground floor.  And there's a window.  So if he sits in a certain place, the computer faces the window.  He can't do that.  Where he's sitting there.  If he sits on the sofa and jerks off, he's going to balance it on his fat knees.  And the fucking, the door, the door will open and she'll be able to look left and see what he's jerking off to. 
[00:44:30]  But when he's sitting there, it's the one place where the fucking computer's facing the kitchen behind him and not the front door.  So he's, and he's practiced that shut it down.  Sure he has.  And Dawn doesn't sneak in.  She probably doesn't jingle the key.  Jingle, jingle, jingle.  She just walks in all happy, whistling.  Not knowing.  Yeah.  That he's.  Because she's not married to a creep.  Yeah, exactly.  She probably gets sick.  I think the whistling stops and she gets closer to the door and is thinking like, oh yeah.  Yeah, that's who's behind the other side.  The depression sticks in. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, like the whistle gets slowly sadder and turns into fucking like taps.  Or like a prison documentary whistle.  She realizes the lump that's probably smoking and jerking off with his slippers on.  He fucking smokes in his apartment.  Smokes in his apartment.  I guess that doesn't matter if you're a smoker.  Yeah, if you're a smoker.  Anyone coming into that place.  What the fuck?  I didn't think anyone did that anymore.  He does.  I think that's the first time I've been in someone's apartment where they smoke in it.  Yeah.  In a long time.  I would hate to smell his keyboard.  Ugh. 
[00:45:30]  Nicotine and crumbs and loads and asshole.  What about his fingertips with all the shit he's in?  Ugh.  Fucking awful.  Those poor keys.  Oh God, we were holding the keys.  Oh no.  No, I mean the fucking keys on the computer.  Well, that's true, yeah.  The computer keys.  Sure, sure.  That fucking, that return key, because that's the one you use to X or whatever, that return  key has probably got a, I'd love to fucking get a DNA swab on that.  Probably a lot of different substances on that one key.  Yeah, no doubt. 
[00:46:00]  Or on the C. I bet you on the C key there's a lot too.  And the K.  The O key has got a few fucking.  Oh yeah.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  God damn.  All right.  Good old Bobby.  Jimmy back from L.A., and that's good.  All right, I guess we'll take a break, huh?  What do we got going on today?  Anything?  Oh, the couch of Zilchers today.  Oh, really?  Yes.  No.  What?  Yes.  Stalker Patty and David from Israel? 
[00:46:30]  Oh, not intern David.  No.  You know David from Israel who calls us?  Yes.  Yes, David.  What, is he going to be in New York, I guess?  Oh no.  Because he's stopping by today.  I hope he's not involved in that big case that's going on.  The fucking Hasidics.  Oh boy.  Oh, David.  It's deeply depressing, man.  Terrible.  That guy's fucking...  My question today is, did this guy just start killing, or are we going to fucking find  out some shit in the coming days?  I don't know.  I bet he's been up to shenanigans.  You don't see Ascidic Jews doing that kind of...  I mean, occasionally, it's really rare, man. 
[00:47:00]  That's not something a profiler would have picked up on.  I just stopped reading this one, because this guy's a fucking creep.  Yeah.  He's a monster, man.  I just remembered the kid.  You'd like to see this guy just shot in the fucking...  That's what he said yesterday.  Just shoot him.  That's...  And now he's on suicide watch.  You know what?  Let him go.  Not as good as, you know, putting a bullet to the back of his head, but let him fucking  kill himself then.  There's no easy way to kill yourself in prison, so he'll suffer a bit.  And get him off this fucking planet. 
[00:47:30]  How did that guy...  What use does he have?  The Craigslist killer, Philip Markham.  I forget how he killed himself, but he figured...  He's just a smart dude.  He figured out how to kill himself and kill him.  What, he'd choke himself?  Choke yourself.  Also, he'd cut himself, too.  But he knew that he was in fucking...  And he'd put a bag on his head or some shit.  Oh.  Nah, you can find stuff.  Yeah, this guy's probably gonna get the shit beat out of him.  In the joint.  I don't know, man.  I like to think prisoners do that, but...  Do convicts really beat up kid rapists and kid killers? 
[00:48:00]  I think they do.  I think they beat them up.  I hope they do.  They'll punch them in the face.  It goes unreported, like...  It's not gonna make the news unless you really get fucking the shit beat out of you.  Fuck yeah.  Like, dumber.  Fuck yeah.  Yeah, I think as you walk by, you know, someone might flick your food, punch you in the face.  You hope so.  Yeah, you do.  It doesn't happen, though.  Not enough.  Unfortunately, they gotta protect them now and all that crap.  That's what they do.  Because, you know, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:48:30]  They shouldn't, though.  It should be a fucking, a horrible place for a child molester or whatever, and they should  be released in the general population.  A murder.  Yeah.  Before we go to break, Seth in Illinois.  The Emmy nominations happened yesterday, and our pal Louis CK was nominated for a whole  bunch of Emmys.  I heard two.  Was it two?  I heard it was...  Okay.  I heard two Emmys.  It was Best Actor in a Comedy Series and Best Writing.  Oh, wow.  Maybe there's more, but I thought Louis tweeted that there was two.  Okay.  He writes, oh, does Jimmy know the one scene he did for Louis, poker scene, is now Emmy 
[00:49:00]  nominated?  But I'm confused by that, because that was last season.  That was the first season.  Well, this one's tuned.  It couldn't be for this season.  Yeah.  I didn't know that that was nominated.  That's great.  So they're that far behind, I guess?  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  I guess.  Because don't forget, cable works differently than network traditional seasons.  Well, that's fucking cool, Jimmy.  I didn't know that was the scene that was nominated.  I had no idea.  Yeah.  The scene you were in is Emmy nominated.  Oh, good, good.  According to Seth in Illinois.  Oh, so maybe it is more than two.  I just don't know. 
[00:49:30]  That creep murderer guy has karaoke shit up online.  Oh, boy.  Oh, we got it.  Please.  Do we have it?  Can we see it?  We might have to hear some of his...  Is he good?  Yeah, we'll...  I haven't heard it.  Yeah, we'll play it after the break so we can eat and stuff.  What's he sing?  What kind of songs?  It's...  Yeah.  Hava.  Yeah, Hebrew.  I don't know any of these, but the three that they list here is If I Never See Your Face  Again.  Oh, boy.  Oh, wow.  No air.  Oh, boy.  Oh, really?  Oh, my God.  Why does it always work out this way?  And what else? 
[00:50:00]  Bring Me to Life.  Oh, wow.  Those are really the three songs.  Yeah.  I swear.  Wow.  Jesus.  Why does it always work out this way?  It really does.  It's creepy.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll listen to that shit after the break.  Oh, here's the...  Jesus is just...  It keeps getting back.  There's another duet called Broken.  Ah.  A duet.  Seems to make a little sense.  Wow, that's horrible.  And Lucky, which I get finally breaks the mold here.  Yeah.  He sings it ironically.  Yeah. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  All right.  We'll break and we'll play some of the creeps out there.  Yeah.  Good to see Bobo, too, at least on the couch in the chair of honor.  Is he coming in for the chair of honor today?  Oh, he's not?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh.  Oh, wasn't he supposed to?  Oh, no.  Oh, he should have called.  Why didn't he call?  Oh.  All right.  Well, I guess he's not interested anymore.  So, by the way.  He hasn't come in.  By the way.  By the way for the show.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:51:00]  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  How's this?  Why is it being played?  I don't know this one.  We just got new rejoiners.  This is 3.11.  Oh.  New 3.11?  It's called Sunset in July.  Is it old?  I don't know.  I don't know much about 3.11.  Me neither. 
[00:51:30]  I know the basics, but.  Oh.  All right.  I thought maybe, you know, somebody's birthday or something.  No.  Ah.  Well, we got to announce the death.  Oh, what?  Of a character actor.  Ah, yes, yes, yes.  Remember old man Marley?  Yeah.  He's dead.  He was old forever.  He was in the Home Alone movies.  Yep.  87 years old.  The old guy.  The old guy from Home Alone is no longer with us.  Yeah. 
[00:52:00]  Bye-bye, funny man.  He was always old.  You know, they had a Betty Ford thing on today.  You know, she did an interview in 2004 at the age of 80.  I guess she would have been 86.  And I couldn't believe she was 86 and how she was talking.  Really?  Yeah.  Like, it was easy.  Like, fucking sharp?  Sharp as a tack?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Seven years later, she dies at 93, but...  Yeah, well, hang on, though.  Helen Mirren is in the paper today.  What is she doing? 
[00:52:30]  I know this bothers you.  It really bothers me.  So I ripped it out of the paper just to bother you.  Oh.  I'm kind of on board with you.  When I read this, you're going to be so annoyed.  You got a big, fucking old tits.  Nah, man.  That's all right.  Danny, I know you'll play.  You'll play, right?  I don't know.  I mean...  You'll play, Danny.  I'd like to see it in person.  I mean, there could be a lot of damage there that you're just not seeing.  We're looking at Helen Mirren in a little...  A bikini.  A red bikini.  She's looking.  She knows she's being photographed. 
[00:53:00]  I'm sure she's sucking in a world of hurt.  I don't know, man.  Would you?  Probably.  I so would.  I mean, it would be easy to say,  like, no, no, fuck that.  But, you know, if she was there, like, jerking me off,  of course I'm going to stick my dick in her head.  Yeah, right.  Fuck that.  Well, that picture is the most flattering I've ever seen of her.  Tell you the truth.  She kept her shit together, I'm telling you.  And don't even ask Jimmy, would you?  Jimmy, would you?  Oh.  Hang on, let me get back.  Yeah, get back to that picture.  Helen Mirren, Jimmy, would you?  Um, no. 
[00:53:30]  Well, look at the picture, though, before you say no.  Oh, your eyes went out.  His eyebrows went up a little bit.  Helen has really great big tits.  She's sexy for an older woman.  She's really hot.  And they look like they don't sag too bad.  Look at her abs.  I mean, she has a body on her.  Yeah, and they've got nice hips.  But I'm not, uh, she's too old for me.  It's the old woman mouth that would bother me and the gray hair.  Yeah.  But everything else.  I took a photo with her, and she's fucking, uh,  pretty sexy in real life.  She's good in person, man.  Does she have those dried lips? 
[00:54:00]  Nah.  Those dried, cracked lips?  Go to the first one where she's bending over a little bit.  She was always sexy.  Uh, in the bathing suit.  Oh, right, where she's on the boat or wherever.  Yeah, right there.  Oh, Jesus.  Look at those tits.  They're hanging in there, man.  She was kind of, uh, I saw an interview with her from the 70s.  Wow.  Where she was being interviewed in Britain,  and it was an uncomfortable interview,  because the guy was talking about her sexuality.  But even back then, she was just known as this fucking, like,  really, like, she had that slutty, sexy image. 
[00:54:30]  She was like a dirty girl.  Well, she started that way, but now she's known as a dame.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  She had the sexy roles where she was showing off her body.  But she's still dirty.  Look at that.  Oh, what's going on?  Which one?  The one where they have those...  In her tits.  Yeah, look at that.  Oh, that's back in the day, as they call it, the day.  The left one's always a little bigger than the right one.  You see, though, and this is forever ago,  and they're already trying to, like, look behind her.  Mm-hmm.  So I can't even imagine what that looks like now.  The left one is always bigger. 
[00:55:00]  Why?  We figured out the heart's kind of closer to the left side or something,  pumping more blood.  It may be.  What was our theory on this?  Is it always the left?  I don't know.  Girls will tell you.  The left boob is just slightly bigger.  I don't know why.  Mm.  Let's see another picture.  Let's see that bitch.  More recent picture, I guess.  Well, there's one in the paper.  Well, no.  That one's not doing anything.  This will drive you nuts.  Oh, see?  Okay.  Now she's wearing the old woman.  The grandma one piece.  Old woman baby suit.  Look at her big tits, though, man. 
[00:55:30]  She has good fucking heavy tits.  She's got that E.T.  old lady body going.  That one does have big tits.  That one's a little rough.  No denying that.  That one's a little worse.  Anyway.  Big, fat, fucking suckable tits.  She's on the cover of Esquire magazine.  It's in the paper today.  Esquire.  There is no taming the dame.  Ah, the dame.  Yes, yes.  In the August issue of Esquire, Helen Mirren poses in nothing but the Union Jack.  Yes.  She doesn't have old lady lips.  I'm looking at a picture close up. 
[00:56:00]  Her lips are nice.  Yeah.  By the looks of the ageless big screen siren.  Ageless.  Yeah.  And this is what's going to drive Anthony nuts.  And actually, I'm on board with this.  It's no wonder she beat 25-year-old Megan Fox by a landslide in the...  Anyone want to guess?  Sexy voting?  Or sexy category?  In the magazine's Sexiest Woman Alive competition.  Just stop it.  Get the fuck out of here.  That's the sexiest woman alive.  Look at that picture of her.  Yeah.  I'm looking at an old lady on the beach. 
[00:56:30]  And now can you give me a picture of Megan Fox?  I would...  Just go with any Megan Fox picture, by the way.  You don't even have to get the best one.  Megan Fox after a fire.  The one that launched her career.  Yeah.  All right.  How about that?  Fuck.  So...  Yeah, that's not as sexy.  Her under the hood of the Camaro there in Transformers.  That's not as sexy as the old woman on the beach?  Maybe they talk to people in the fucking thumb fetish club.  Oh, man.  Bill Maher actually had the best bit on fucking...  How he's sick and tired of... 
[00:57:00]  Who's the big sex symbol?  Not Raquel Welch.  Who's the other one?  Sophia Loren.  Yeah.  Being on these sexy lists and he just fucking attacks these old ladies that people think  are sexy.  Yeah, it's ridiculous.  It used to be.  Oh, man.  But, I mean, they wrote this like it's a fact that people really think Helen Mirren is sexier  than Megan Fox.  That's just ridiculous.  Where is that vote?  In some fucking dumb rag magazine?  Helen Mirren beat Megan Fox by a landslide.  Landslide, right.  Get the fuck out of here.  Sure it is. 
[00:57:30]  Just dumb nonsense.  Magazines have a lot of just dumb nonsense in them.  Nonsense.  It's just nonsense reading.  The entertainment mags.  Oh, yeah.  Right?  Yeah, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's just icky.  I don't want any part of that.  That's icky, right, Ant?  Ew.  Ew, icky.  Ew, she's in a...  Her thumbs suck.  Jesus Christ.  Now I gotta cover my thumbs for the rest of the show.  If they were wrapped around your dick, you wouldn't care.  Yeah, I wouldn't.  I would actually.  Get your feet off my dick.  Oh, sorry, ladies.  Boy, they really do make an issue of her thumbs. 
[00:58:00]  They're hard.  They're toned thumbs.  Look, I got the same fucking thumbs.  Yeah, but you're not a sex symbol.  You're a dirty fucking radio DJ.  Your thumbs don't matter.  Look at it.  I got the same fucking thing.  She can't go bowling either.  I can't fucking find a bowling ball that fit this thumb.  That's how they always know when you're bowling when they hear, shit.  All right.  I'll just want to.  That's the sound.  It's a great line, but that's exactly what happens.  What is that? 
[00:58:30]  A normal thumb?  My ball lifts up a little too high because it gets stuck at first.  Well, you know, there are ways to have your...  They actually have balls that just have like a little crater.  You can just put that part in and grip it a certain way.  Well, my problem is I have to get the...  I just made the whole thing up.  I have to get the bowling ball for the big hand guys.  Oh, really?  Because they figure, all right, big hand guys have thicker thumbs.  A giant thumb.  But I got small hands and then this fucking bulbous weird thumb.  So you got the big reach.  Yeah, so I can't bowl properly.  That'd be a great little piece for a singles ad. 
[00:59:00]  I got these small hands and these great bulbous thumbs.  I just can't bowl properly.  Seeking friends.  I used to go to the Huntington Lanes.  I thought I was going to be a bowling star for, you know.  Did you really?  Oh, yeah.  I liked it.  I think I joined a bowling league.  Ball on Xbox Kinect.  Huh?  It's better.  Yeah, that's true.  I was a great bowler.  I just didn't like it.  I bowled at 240.  It just bores me.  You're so lying.  There's no way you fucking bowled at 240. 
[00:59:30]  I did when I was 14.  No.  Look at your face.  What was it?  Bumper bowling?  It was 10 24s.  Sorry.  10 games of 24.  I just added them up.  Bumper bowling?  Is there anything worse than bumper bowling?  Bumper bowling.  I never heard of it.  And it's very hard to find a bowling alley that's just a fucking bowling alley these days.  Yeah.  It's like, I don't need fucking blasting music, fluorescent lights, disco balls.  It's like, yeah, I'm trying to actually play the game here. 
[01:00:00]  I don't need the risk of an epileptic seizure.  Yeah, a fucking Pokemon seizure.  I just want to bowl with my pals and get a pitcher of beer.  We're doing some rock and bowling tonight, fluorescent headpin, get some fucking, just  put, could I have a 19 fucking 50s bowling alley with Schlitz signs up and, yeah, that's  what I want.  I kind of like it, actually.  I haven't done it in a while, but.  You know, it's good if that's what you want to go for, but if you're actually going to  bowl a game, it's crazy.  It was smart.  I don't like to fucking play golf and have fucking music blasting and disco balls 
[01:00:30]  and be like, I'm trying to play a game here.  I want to golf at night, though.  There's a few courses that light up the whole course, but you have to be good because they  can't have lights everywhere, so you've got to be close to the fairway to take advantage  of the lights.  Mitch Kumpstein.  That's right.  You're the Fudway.  Your ball goes in the woods and you're fucked.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  I thought we were going to move on from bowling, but this is going to start a whole thing right  here.  Ed in Boston, go ahead.  Oh, you're a millionaire. 
[01:01:00]  You could buy your own ball and have the thumb hole drilled out.  Oh, well.  I always thought the guys that had their own bowling balls were faggots.  Really?  And not in the sexual way, but...  Really?  Oh, the guys that showed up to the bowling alley with their own bowling balls and then  they're polishing it before the game and stuff.  Got to polish your ball bag.  They don't want anybody else touching...  They don't want those dirty thumb holes.  That is true.  What the fuck is inside those...  You know what I used to do?  I used to take my tongue and lick out the fucking finger holes in the ball. 
[01:01:30]  Like that.  There you go.  I'll take a greasy bowling ball any day before I, you know, have my own bowling ball bag.  Ed, do you have your own bowling bag?  No, I don't.  I don't bowl.  You know bowling balls must run for the hills when they see Bob Kelly walking up in his  bowling shoes?  Those fucking finger holes, they all try to shrink themselves so his shitty cheese doodle  asshole fingers can't slide in.  Cheese doodle and assholes.  I bet you the bowling balls talk about them, what they smell like today.  Dog tongue and asshole. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, that'd be awful.  You're the next guy.  I had them last week.  It was cigarettes and cake, an ugly combination.  I think Ratspitt's got it.  He says, Opie, bowling is white trash beneath you, sir.  Bowling?  Do you bowl?  For fun.  Not for, you know.  I'd go.  I would go bowling.  If somebody's going like, hey, I'm going bowling.  You want to go?  I'm up.  Well, of course, for fun.  We never thought you'd do it to prevent a beheading.  What are the reasons?  Could you do it?  The pressure would be on, right? 
[01:02:30]  Got a strike.  Remember we were trying to get the homeless to go bowling?  Yes.  We should bring that back.  Homeless bowling.  Oh, yeah.  Because everything works with the homeless here at this fucking place.  Well, you must indemnify the company just in case a homeless guy fucking throws a bowling  ball at a child's head, right?  Yeah.  We're in some kind of quandary with the company right now, aren't we?  Yeah.  They want us to do like a couple gigs, but we're not taking any fucking responsibility.  So now they can see what we go through every day with the lawyers. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  I don't need that.  No.  They want us to...  Oh, never mind.  Maybe two inside.  Fuck it.  Sorry.  We're good, though.  Huh?  Yeah, I think we're all right.  Why?  Why?  You got an update?  Did you see any email from Mr. Bob Eadman?  It's all good.  Yeah.  What?  Yeah.  We're all good.  Bob Eadman, he tongues the ball.  What movie is that?  Did he write me?  Lebowski.  When did he write it?  Last night, I believe.  I think you got one from Bob.  I do believe. 
[01:03:30]  If one of you guys have it, could you forward it to me?  Sure.  Now we're doing some inside shit on the air.  That's right.  Just email chatter.  People love email talk.  They do?  Email talk Fridays.  All right.  Good.  Business talk.  Yes.  Who's this guy?  Bobo.  Some Bobo is on the line.  Bobo.  Yeah, I'm here.  Oh, hi, Bobo.  So I guess we're going to see you in the studio today.  The chair of honor is yours today, sir?  Unfortunately, I didn't get that email. 
[01:04:00]  I didn't even know that they were doing this this week.  All right.  My computer is working.  Well, could you get here in 20 minutes?  I don't know 20 minutes, but I can get here in time.  I could leave right now, shower, and I'll be there.  Yeah?  20 minutes?  That's a great scene, too.  Polishing their balls.  I don't know if I can make it 20 minutes, but I can make it there in an hour.  An hour?  Jimmy, what do you think?  Jeez, the show's like over.  Oh. 
[01:04:30]  Wait, right here.  Yeah.  I don't know what you're saying.  If he can only make him.  Yeah, the chair of honor.  What?  I got it.  That's the chair of honor, right?  So you want Bobo to get here?  What do you think?  Yeah, I think so.  All right, Bobo, if you can get here.  All right.  I can get there.  If you're not here by 742, we've got to take back the offer.  All right.  I can try here. 
[01:05:00]  Bobo, you should bring Ope's Met ticket.  Oh, fuck.  Do you have it on you, buddy?  Yeah, I don't have the Met tickets for the closer seats.  I got the ones for the other day.  My friend has those tickets.  That's fine.  Just bring it so you can talk to him about the game.  Yeah, well, you should bring it anyway.  It's like a good faith thing.  Oh, my God.  Don't tempt me.  I put that part of me behind me for a while.  Don't tempt me.  Bobo, we'll see you in about an hour then, I guess.  All right.  I'll bring that and I'll bring the ticket.  Thank you.  Yeah, do that. 
[01:05:30]  All right.  Bobo is on his way.  Blood away.  Blood, blood, blood away.  God.  It's just nothing but idiocy.  You missed yesterday.  We talked about KFC chicken for an hour.  Oh, God.  Did we ever.  And then in the end, because people always wonder how this stuff plays out, we never got our chicken.  We never got it.  They didn't open until after we got out of here.  Yeah.  That shit happens. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  But I did listen to some of that on the replay.  It was fun.  It was funny.  Just denying people chicken.  And I really would have had a piece.  So let's go with something else.  Now, though, I'm just kind of like, no.  Want to go donuts today?  No.  No.  No.  You don't like donuts?  I'm not a big donut guy.  Not a big fan of the donut.  Where are you at with cupcakes?  Not a big fan of the cupcake.  Cupcakes have made a huge comeback in the last few years, though. 
[01:06:30]  Not a fan.  No.  No.  If I'm going to eat something that's not good for me to eat.  Roland Hurt is talking about food.  Holy shit, Roland.  Rare steak.  Donut plant's open right now.  What?  The best donuts.  Where is it?  2037th.  I know.  And what's it called?  Donut plant.  They're at the Threat Luscious Donuts.  So good.  Donut plant?  I have no idea what he said.  Donut plant?  I couldn't understand him either. 
[01:07:00]  I heard donuts.  Sam was talking yesterday about how there are certain interpreters in here that will help  you to interpret what Roland is saying at times.  Okay.  Say it slowly.  Donut plant.  Donut plant.  Donut plant.  What makes them the best donut place in the city?  They're so delicious.  They're airy, fluffy.  Yeah, but do they have special flavors that no one else is doing?  Threat Luscious.  What?  It's called Threat Slashers.  Throat Slashers?  No, Threats Leches. 
[01:07:30]  The Three Milks.  The Slutches?  Three Milks in Spanish.  Threats Leches.  That's in Spanish.  Tres Leches?  Yes.  You can't even speak your own language properly.  Wait.  Tres?  Tres?  Tres Leches.  Tres Leches.  Tres Leches.  Tres Leches.  Three Leaches.  Three Leaches.  It's delicious.  Why is that one good?  It's so good.  Three milks?  Like three different milks into the donut.  It's really good.  Isn't there just one milk?  Yes, we know. 
[01:08:00]  When did we realize we can't understand Roland?  Because I remember back at the other place, I never really had a problem.  I don't think.  But now it's very difficult to understand you sometimes, Roland.  I wonder what that is.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I was very impressed at your restaurant prowess yesterday.  Yeah.  Any type of food that came up, Roland knew exactly where to go to get it. 
[01:08:30]  He knew.  This city is his.  His for the eating.  He just walks around like Pac-Man around this city.  I see you got the U2 shirt on, and we were this close to having the exact same shirt on today.  Oh, shit.  I figured I wanted to be warm, so I went long sleeve, but I had my U2 shirt out today.  They played Philly last night, right?  Yeah.  Keith Robinson went and saw them.  He texted me. 
[01:09:00]  Keith likes U2?  Well, no.  But, I mean, not to my knowledge, but I got a text.  What the fuck is this?  Oh, shit.  White people, man.  White people music.  I'm fucking ball shot.  No, I got it.  We're in the streets of New York.  Mark.  Hold on a second.  I got this random text from him.  He's like, at U2 concert.  It's pretty amazing.  So I wrote back.  I've never seen them live.  And he writes, it's my first white concert.  And I write, I hope you get jumped. 
[01:09:30]  And he writes, would you be happy to hear a hate crime happened at the U2 concert?  And I wrote, a yes.  So he really enjoyed himself.  But I was hoping he'd be attacked.  Well, you know.  I heard a ridiculous number, how much U2 brings in a night.  If you could find that figure.  Well, I know the.  It is unbelievable.  I know the tour total, what they're going to.  What's the tour total?  You do know this?  Yeah, Jonathan got to go in their fucking, in their casinos, Chris Blackwell, who discovered them. 
[01:10:00]  So they get to go in their fucking, the motorcade that takes them to and from the show.  And what I hear is the tour, over three years, will bring in 900 million and will net, will gross 900 million and they'll net 200 million.  So it's 150 trucks needed for their tour.  Yeah, it's crazy overhead, this tour.  It's insane.  It's amazing how Bono talks about poverty.  And there's literally 700, I mean, there's probably a lot of taxes and legit expenses. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, yeah.  Hundreds of millions of dollars because their stage is so big.  But he is putting people to work.  A lot of guys are working.  A lot of people are fucking working.  No, no, that's true.  That's true.  But just the fucking amount of trucks.  You ever see when they do that, they showed a fast motion.  Setting up the stage.  Of setting up and taking down the stage.  And, like, clockwork.  And the amount of trucks that are just pulling in, leaving, pulling in, leaving, unloading shit.  This huge fucking stage being built.  They can't do it.  They have three different stages.  It's not the same one every time. 
[01:11:00]  Right, right.  It takes so long to set up.  Yeah, they've got to be setting up at the next venue.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  You start as a band where you just get your equipment, go on stage and play, and then it comes to this point.  That's got to be just an amazing feel.  Yeah.  How do they figure that out?  That's that time lapse.  It's like they just make a puzzle every night.  Dude, there are cranes.  Wow.  There are cranes that are used for fucking buildings.  Yeah.  They're selling that stage when the tour's over, too, I read.  To who?  Museum.  I don't know. 
[01:11:30]  They're doing a museum.  The screen's going to a museum in England, I think.  Really?  Jesus Christ.  Can you find out how much they're making tonight?  I thought...  Do you want to watch this video?  Look at all these people.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Keep this going.  The amount of workers, and it's going overnight, you know.  I want to go to this show so bad.  I'm going Wednesday.  Do you know what, logistically, how this would...  Am I going Wednesday?  Like the first time they set it up, how long it must have taken?  You said you want the VIP treatment.  I'm not going to the VIP.  Oh, you're not VIP?  No, I got tickets, though. 
[01:12:00]  They're down by the stage.  I really do want VIP treatment this year.  I know it sounds horrible to say that, but look, I'm usually a regular guy at a concert,  but I want kind of a better experience.  This is days going by.  Yeah.  They're hoisting up the stage.  It's a massive fucking stage.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, just...  What are you doing?  I know they're putting a lot of people to work, but that's a lot of hundreds of millions  of dollars, just so you can see a big screen.  Yeah.  It really is just fucking amazing. 
[01:12:30]  I think it's just a million a day just to have it out.  Just hanging out.  Just to have it there.  Yeah.  God damn, it's a big ass.  So it could look like a big spider-y thing.  I don't know.  Yeah, and then you think of the Beatles playing Shea with some fucking amps on the field.  And they're fucking...  They didn't even have like a stage.  They're just standing on grass.  Wow.  And their LED is like eight stories.  You wonder who it is that's in charge.  There's somebody who's in charge of the stage testing.  I think Willie Williams, the guy who always does every tour. 
[01:13:00]  Their tour manager.  Holy shit.  65,000 people a night, I think they do.  Yeah.  Wow.  And Jersey's like, it's going to be 100,000.  Is it really?  Wow.  That LED thing that drops down from the middle of that is fucking amazing.  Yeah.  I had one like that at my house.  No, you didn't.  I went to...  God damn, it's a light show.  I went to the Jersey show a year and a half ago, and I had to leave at the Encore because  the word got out that it was a two-hour wait just to get out of the parking lot.  It shoved so many fucking people in there. 
[01:13:30]  I am Mr. Leave.  Two hours just to get out of the parking lot.  They call me the Leave before the Encore key.  Really?  I never do.  I might listen to one fucking Encore song, and then I got to get the fuck out of there.  Well, I wouldn't...  And as I'm leaving, I'm smiling like, I'm glad I got the fuck out of there.  Clear sailing, no one in front of you.  Yes.  It is a good feeling, but...  I mean, I wouldn't do that for you two normally, but I had to work the next day.  I was like, I can't sit in a parking lot for two hours just to get out of the parking  lot.  I'd be...  And then there'd be traffic all the way back into New York City. 
[01:14:00]  But it wouldn't be two hours because football games happen.  No, because they're using all the...  Field too, right, right.  The field space too.  So the parking lots can't really handle that many people.  Even the subway got overloaded.  It took us, me and my brother, like, almost close to four hours to get home.  Four hours to get home.  Popular band.  And just so people know, I mean, four hours, the stadium's maybe, what, five miles away?  Yeah.  Wow.  I just don't...  I don't think they stink.  I just don't like U2.  Their music does nothing for me. 
[01:14:30]  I've always loved U2.  I wish I did.  That would be a fun place to...  How do you not like Elevation?  What's Elevation?  I mean, it's not...  It's a new one.  It's a newer song.  I like Vertigo.  It was a good time.  And that Vertigo...  Play Elevation.  That's a newer song.  Like, that's very poppy and very catchy.  Yeah.  Right?  They show the thing getting taken down too.  Wow.  Like ants.  You know this song, right, Jimmy?  Yeah.  This is...  I'll tell you a minute.  I like this.  So far, I don't know it.  They stink.  I'm with Jimmy on this one. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, yeah.  I heard this.  It's fine.  I like this song.  I wouldn't wait in traffic to see it.  What do you want to know?  How much money they're making a night?  Well, the tickets are $500, $250, $100.  I think the number was something like they're bringing in $10 million a night.  I think I saw Foghat for $8.  Yeah.  $500 for tickets?  For the floor.  Way to stay in touch with the common people.  And they pack the place out. 
[01:15:30]  That's outrageous, though, to be honest with you.  At that point, download every fucking YouTube song for free.  If I'm going to pay $500 for a show, I have no guilt if I get free music.  No guilt in my soul.  Fuck that.  I don't think this song is awful, but it just...  That is a great song.  It bounces off my ears, and it doesn't move me at all.  Some of the older songs, too.  Fucking off Joshua Tree. 
[01:16:00]  What's the song of Josh?  Sunday, but it's not anything good to him.  Where the streets have no name.  I don't know that song.  Really?  I'm sure I've heard it.  Let's hear that.  With or Without You.  That's a good tune.  Bullet to Blue Sky.  With or Without You is a good tune.  Red Hell, Mighty Town.  Stuff I found.  Ooh.  I don't know those.  Oh, you fail.  Epic fail.  Oh.  Stuff I found.  Ticket receipts for one night.  How much?  $10 million.  They've taken $10 million a night.  That's just tickets.  That doesn't include the $70 t-shirts that they're selling. 
[01:16:30]  Merch.  Oh, that's just the ticket sales.  That's just tickets.  Wow.  So when I heard $10 million a night, it's way more than that.  Because they're selling merch.  They sell $70 t-shirts?  Oh, my God.  $120 t-shirts.  No, they're not.  Yeah, they have limited edition t-shirts.  $120 fucking t-shirts.  Limited edition every night for $10 million.  How are they limited edition?  Because they'll make them.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, $10,000 people every night.  Well, Bruce does that, too.  He charges between $120,000 and $150,000.  That's disgusting.  Wait, what?  Yeah, they have.  And this is my band.  I've always liked YouTube, but that's disgusting.  It's unnecessary. 
[01:17:00]  But if people can afford it, it's fine.  But, you know.  They really can't, though.  Just say you're doing it for fucking dentists.  That's where this music is.  It's for dentists.  Them and Dave Matthews should tour together.  We like rich white people.  Oh, which is fine, but just say that.  Don't act like you're a man of the people.  You're not Africa, stupid.  People eat their own shit.  Consider it delicious.  Bono does a lot for Africa.  He does do a lot for Africa.  He used to be the go-to guy for the charities and shit.  Now, not so much.  He does a lot for charity. 
[01:17:30]  I mean, he's given probably more in a week than I'll give in my entire life.  Probably made more.  But that's the problem that I have is that he does a lot for charity  or says that he does a lot for charity,  and then he charges $120 for a limited edition t-shirt, you know.  Like, you don't need to do that.  They're super soft.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Are they soft and comfy?  How long is the fucking opening to this song?  It's long.  We got it.  I love seeing this stuff through Jimmy's eyes. 
[01:18:00]  I know.  This song's been around for almost 25 years at this point.  What year?  87, I guess, so 24 years?  I think this album came out in 87.  I was just a kid when I went and saw them.  You've got to give these guys longevity.  That's for sure.  Fuck yeah.  Holy fuck.  They've been around forever.  79?  When MTV, like, first came out, they were some of the first videos.  Were they?  And, like, they're still fucking, not only around, but gigantic. 
[01:18:30]  When you go to, uh...  You know what's such an underrated U2 album is that Rattle and Hump.  That Rattle and Hump has some great songs that never made radio.  Okay.  I don't know this song.  You don't know this song.  Turn it up a little bit.  Jimmy, just walk...  Yeah, yeah, I've heard the chorus.  I don't know it.  Just walking through life, you've had to have heard this song. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I just didn't read it.  I heard the chorus.  I've heard it.  Bond and the Andrew is doing Letterman on Monday.  Bond is fucking great.  So why don't we get him on the show?  They're Spider-Man.  That's one...  Spider-Man?  No, no, they're doing this promoting Spider-Man.  That's why they promote it on this fucking radio show.  It's obviously a shitty fucking disaster, maybe, because I just said that.  These guys don't do radio.  It's amazing.  Do you know how much...  Someone told me, a promoter, a promoter told me,  how much they need to sell out to even break even because of the disaster that they've had. 
[01:19:30]  They shouldn't just do Letterman.  How about you fucking switch it up and do radio?  I would shit my pants if Bond walked in that door.  That's one where I would lose my mind.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck that.  I would be starstruck.  There's not many.  I would be fine talking to him because I'm not a fan.  There's not many.  I would just fucking be an idiot.  Like you are with Ozzy, that would be me.  I can interview Ozzy, though.  I don't think I can interview Bond.  I love interviewing guys like that.  I can't interview anyone.  Right, guys?  I love talking to him. 
[01:20:00]  I would lose my mind in front of Bono.  I'll be honest.  Is there a guy you would lose your mind in front of it?  He has to be even dead since the 40s.  Is there one?  In music, I guess.  In music?  For Jimmy, it's Ozzy.  For me, I would have to say Bono's number one.  Nah, anyone could walk in here.  I'd give a shit.  How about Mick Jagger?  That would be pretty big, yeah.  But I mean...  Paul McCartney. 
[01:20:30]  I was in the toilet with half the stones.  True.  Paul McCartney is big, too.  Yeah, yeah.  But I could talk to him.  I wouldn't be able to like...  I wouldn't freak out.  I'm bad with fucking, you know, dumb little B-movie starlets.  They're the ones that I get all fucked up over.  I'm an idiot.  With or without you?  Is it with or without you?  Guys.  Oh, there's one.  No, there's one.  This is good.  One is really good.  Oh, my Christ.  I wasn't listening closely.  Yeah, this is good.  They played this one right after 9-11.  And when we went to go see him. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, fuck.  Oh, my God.  I was booing.  Boo!  Boo!  And they had a giant scream with all the names going by.  All the people that died on 9-11.  Not a dry eye in the house.  Well, of course not.  The concert was on September 12th.  I know.  It was like the 12th.  It's like, thanks, guys.  Yeah, let's put this stage together.  That was fucked, man.  Is that the garden they did that?  Yeah.  Yeah, they just showed.  When you see the names going by on a scroll.  It was just like, oh, God.  Oh, God.  That was a creative thing to do.  Wow.  No one's looking at each other. 
[01:21:30]  It was all uncomfortable.  Guys, Will in Banger, I mean, he says.  Does he?  He says, you two sucks.  Move on, guys.  We better move on.  We better move on.  Because Will doesn't like it.  I think he won't.  Talking about one of the greatest bands of all time.  Or, you know, I'll say this.  One of the most successful bands of all time.  Yeah, they are.  But Will doesn't like them.  So we better move on.  Are they bigger than the Stones touring?  Because the Stones do fucking stadiums, too.  At this point, yeah.  And sell out.  No, at this point, yeah. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, but the Stones probably are a little older and probably have trouble doing three straight years of touring.  But, I mean, as far as sales.  But they just based this on years.  What's that?  Like, U2 was the highest grossing last year.  So if the Stones, you know, tour next year.  I mean, I think they were the.  Could the Stones sell the same amount of tickets worldwide?  Absolutely.  Absolutely, yeah.  I kind of figured.  They play the exact same venues as U2.  They do, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I saw my giant stadium.  I mean, ACDC was number two behind U2.  Wow, yeah.  Out of any band in the world.  Yeah, ACDC's very underrated on the grand scale. 
[01:22:30]  Look at the names going by.  We got the video up.  You can check it out for yourself on.  Oh, that was so bad.  Oh, wow.  Oh, yeah, they list them.  NYPD, FD.  And it starts, and then it just.  It just didn't end.  It kept going and going, and it's like, oh, my God, this is torture.  And then you look around, and everyone was fucking tearing up or crying.  It's like, yeah, thanks, U2.  Trying to have a good fucking time.  We're trying to forget about this stuff.  Thanks.  Oh, that was Super Bowl halftime show, 2002.  Did they do that there, too? 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, but they did it way before the Super Bowl.  Yeah, yeah.  Is that where this is?  Yeah.  Yeah, they did it when it was still fucking fresh.  Real fresh.  It's amazing how the Edge and Bono, everybody knows, but nobody, I don't know the other names  of the guys.  Larry Mullen.  Larry what?  Bill Tetley.  And Bill Tetley.  Oh, that's good.  One T, one B, one I, two L's, one T, one E, one T, one L, one E, a bunch of Y's, Bill Tetley. 
[01:23:30]  One F, one F, one F, one F, one F, one Naughty Boys.  The U2 version.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  Hey, is it true that U2 doesn't file taxes?  Really?  They found a tax loophole?  I got it.  I got it.  How do you find a loophole making that much money?  Steve in Jersey.  Go ahead, Steve. 
[01:24:00]  Yes, hello.  I'm gay.  This will drive him nuts.  I was on vacation in Dublin, and the newspapers and the people over there talk about the fact  that with Bono talking about taking care of your fellow man, they incorporated, they moved  their incorporation to, I believe it's the Netherlands, to avoid the extra high taxes in  Ireland.  Why would that drive me crazy?  Good.  Good for them.  People being able to keep their own money?  Wow, that drives me fucking batshit. 
[01:24:30]  Please, take half their money and fucking give it to somebody.  Ireland's probably the higher.  I love when people are able to do that.  Good for them.  Can we do that?  Yeah, really.  That's what I want to know.  Hey, Bob.  How are they able to do that, but we can't?  Work on it.  But isn't that great, though, that their own country couldn't keep them there?  It's like, what a hell of a fucking embarrassing.  Yeah.  They have to go to the Netherlands.  The Netherlands.  How does the Netherlands make money?  They talk about how they, you know, he talks a big game, Bono, great band, but doesn't  practice what he preaches. 
[01:25:00]  But is that true, though?  I'm saying, but the guy does do a lot of charity work.  And you know what?  He's a multimillionaire, but he kind of deserves to be a multimillionaire.  And you know what?  Fucking, you're saying doesn't practice what he preaches?  Why?  Given the government the money is a great way to take care of people?  All the fucking misappropriation of funds and graft and fucking corruption?  Fuck that.  I'd rather keep all my money and dole it out as I please to who needs it.  And I think he does practice what he preaches, because if he's saving so much money on taxes, 
[01:25:30]  he's probably giving a little extra in charity, I would imagine.  It makes it easier to give up money for charities.  I'm with you on that.  I live in Jersey, so I pay a shitload of taxes.  Yeah, no shit.  Stupid New York and fucking New Jersey.  Yep, city tax.  Suck dick.  Yeah, take that fudge to the store.  I remember.  That's what I say when I'm mad.  Take that fudge home with you and chew on it.  Language.  I remember one of our guys, he was on the YouTube detail when I saw them at the garden a few years back. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  And someone's got to help me out with this loophole they have, too.  They have to get off U.S. soil by a certain fucking time.  Like, if they're in the United States for too many days or something like that, I'm trying to remember the story.  Are they considered residents?  Something like that.  So it so happened, the Madison Square Garden show I went to, and I was with this person, he's like,  they're not coming back for an encore, because they have to be off the ground by midnight. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, right, right.  Or there's some incredible penalty they have to pay.  Oh, wow.  And it is a race to the airport, because they were cutting it really, really close.  And not only do they have to get to the airport, they have to be off the fucking ground.  And if anyone knows the story, because I'm...  Somebody had to play in Mexico for like two days.  Where?  What?  They go to Mexico for two days.  Yeah, then they...  There's no T and Z in that word.  I can't help you out with that loophole, but I can't help you out with the kiss.  Well, Roland's on to it, because they can't hang out in the States, so they have to leave 
[01:27:00]  for whatever it is, a couple days, then they come back, and then they can start over again.  Yeah.  Yeah, if anyone knows what that's about.  Like, consecutive days makes you a resident, probably.  I think it's a three-month work visa.  Yeah.  Maybe it's that.  Yeah.  That makes sense.  I was going to say, you have to have a work visa.  But this Madison Square Garden show, one of our pals was on the detail to get them to the airport,  where, you know, they had the sirens and everything, giving them the presidential treatment.  Like, their business is based in Ireland, so I would assume that they have work visas.  Well, Jonathan said what they do is, when you leave, because he said he had to leave 
[01:27:30]  before the encore, because all the cars get ready, because they go from the stage, giant  towels are thrown on them, right into the cars, out, and he goes, then when you're in this  police motorcade, and then they peel off from you, like the band and a couple other  cars, I guess, and they go right to a helicopter, and he's saying they fly from Anaheim to fucking  like Cedars-Sinai or something, or some hospital in fucking L.A., and then they go right to  the Chateau Marmont, which is where they stay.  And you know, it took me forever to figure this out, but you know when you go to a concert, 
[01:28:00]  there's the encore, but there's the long delay, and then it's the encore, and then  they do the encore, and they keep the lights down, and making you think they're going to  come out again?  Right.  That's so they could get the fuck out of the venue and not be stuck in the concert traffic.  Stuck in the traffic.  I finally figured that one out.  Everyone's sitting there going, I think they're going to do one more.  Coming out for one more, and you know how they dramatically keep the lights down, and  then they finally pop the lights on, and you get the concert over.  Everyone gets pissed.  That's so those fuckers don't get caught in the traffic.  I like to stand there and try to get like a crowd, like as everybody's filing out of the 
[01:28:30]  exits, I'll stand there and go, one more song, one more song.  How does that work out?  Not well.  Not well.  No one ever gets the rally cry going with me.  The one more song.  Yeah.  As everybody's filing out, I'm like, one more song.  How douchey.  Okay, here we go.  Heather knows a little bit about what I'm talking about from Long Island.  Heather.  Hey, now my husband works for customs, and he deals with Paul McCartney a lot. 
[01:29:00]  When he comes in, he escorts him because...  He's a hooker.  McCartney fucks him in the mouth.  Yeah, she's just playing with that voice.  ...on a plane, or they won't sell V-vans for five years.  So if they have a V-vans and they have to leave a certain day, they have to be out or  they're not allowed back in the country for five years.  And I'm sure they're just here on traveling, you know, not at work or something like that.  So they have to be out. 
[01:29:30]  How's Ron Conkoma?  How's Ron Conkoma?  Yeah.  What town are you from?  London Hurts.  Oh, all right.  Whatever.  And then Brian...  Thank you.  And Brian's saying...  Thanks.  ...her husband is a wine dancer.  30 days per quarter they could stay in the U.S.  30 days per quarter.  If they're working, I guess.  Because, I mean, Bono kind of lives here now.  Does he?  He's got a place in the Upper West.  Oh, does he?  He's been known to walk around a little bit. 
[01:30:00]  Then he can wing on over to London and jam with his Jones.  They hitchhike.  Him and the Edge will hitchhike sometimes.  Oh, wouldn't that be great if they got ass raped?  Sean Penn does that, too.  But there's such an arrogance to that because it's a celebrity looking to make the day of a commoner.  Yes.  Because they're so recognizable.  They know that almost anybody who picks them up will know who they are.  Yeah.  And there's such a pomposity.  That would be great to just not even acknowledge it.  Where are you going?  Yeah. 
[01:30:30]  Drive.  Yeah.  And then they'd start going, like, yeah, you know, we just got to get to rehearsal.  Oh, really?  Yeah, right.  Well, we're going as fast as we can.  Yeah.  Yeah, we got to get down there and get the instruments.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I don't know.  Traffic might be rough.  I got to get to work.  Not a word.  And by the way, Jimmy, you should know that Johnny Cash redid one by U2.  Yeah, I know.  Okay.  Right with Johnny Cash's dumb fucking remakes already.  They're all good, Anthony.  No, they're all good.  They all stink compared to the originals.  I'm sorry. 
[01:31:00]  He did a great fucking cover of, uh, what's the other one by them?  Not just one.  He did the, uh, Atomic Sky one.  I forgot to do it.  Help me out, Travis.  Come on, it's Johnny Cash.  Oh, fuck Johnny Cash and his dead ass.  Huh?  The Wanderer.  Sick of Johnny Cash doing it.  All these fucking songs and everybody treating him like a genius.  Fuck it.  It's an old guy, oldly singing songs.  Oh, Johnny Cash is the shit.  Yeah, the Wanderer. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, the Wanderer.  Oh, this is fun.  I roam around and around and around.  This is good.  Oh, God.  This is good.  Right.  Oh, yeah, one love, right?  That's the one.  Oh, we want the Johnny Cash one.  I hurt myself.  The man comes around.  Who sings that?  That was somebody mixing them together.  That was somebody mixing them together.  Personal Jesus.  Here you go.  Who sings Personal Jesus?  Depeche.  Depeche.  I want to fuck you like an animal. 
[01:32:00]  The fuck is this horse shite?  I love Johnny.  That's sick.  I went out walking through streets paved with gold.  It's a great song.  Lifted some stones, saw the skin and bones of a city without a soul.  I went out walking.  Did ya?  Under an atomic sky.  Where the ground won't turn and the rain, it burns. 
[01:32:30]  Like the tears when I said goodbye.  Yeah, I went out nothing.  Nothing but the thought of you.  I went wandering, wandering.  You don't like this?  No.  I don't.  I don't.  Why?  Is it dramatic?  Yeah.  Look, I'll give Johnny Cash his props for Ring of Fire and shit like that. 
[01:33:00]  How about the wall?  I like that.  I'll give him props for one song.  Yeah, one song.  That's all he gets.  How about fucking Ghost Riders in the Sky?  Yeah, I like that.  Come on.  I like the real Johnny Cash when he was fucking alive and well.  How about Life Goes On, that end of his life fucking.  This is an end of his life, though.  No, I know.  This goes back a little bit.  This ain't.  I love this.  I like this song.  Is Rusty Cage remake?  No, I hate the Rusty Cage remake. 
[01:33:30]  I'd rather just listen to Rusty Cage.  Why the fuck am I going to listen to some old guy fucking dying talking, singing?  Fuck that.  All right, this droning fucking shit.  It's building it.  No, it's not building to anything.  It's one of those songs that builds.  It builds.  It's droning.  It's building.  It's...  I don't understand you sometimes.  I just...  Because you got the voice to do some Johnny Cash shit.  You could get the voice down. 
[01:34:00]  Ah, some of the good old ones.  This weekend, do some Johnny Cash karaoke.  Yeah, we're going to do some Johnny Cash karaoke.  The class...  Oh, now he talks.  Oh, now he's rapping.  Biatch.  Yeah.  I didn't even have to use my AK.  It was a good day.  There was niggas down by the river.  Oh, they was threatening to take my hose. 
[01:34:30]  I caught some niggas slipping.  I think we could all agree that we need some sleeves right now.  Oh, no way.  What?  Sleeves.  What's wrong with sleeves?  I follow sleeves on Twitter.  He doesn't tweet very often, which is good.  Sherwin?  Yes.  That's an old school name.  Sherwin.  But I read some of his tweets and I'm like, what the fuck is this nut talking about?  He's got a name from a fable.  He's got a fable.  He's got a fable.  He's named after a fable, I think.  Sherwin.  Sherwin. 
[01:35:00]  There's no cool way to say that.  No.  Either that or his parents loved to paint.  Yeah.  They loved painting.  Yes.  Sherwin.  Was it Sherwin Williams?  Sherwin Williams.  That's how his parents met.  Oh, beautiful.  Thank you.  The father was a painter.  Oh, thank you.  It's feeling pretty good.  La, la, la, la, la.  Taking my time on the la la la la.  It's Christmas in July, you ladies and gentlemen.  Christmas in July.  It's singing like la, la, la, la, la. 
[01:35:30]  It's going to be stuck in my head now, great.  La, la, la, la.  Taking my way to the la la la la.  What did we sing this to today that was really mean?  There was some brutal fucking remake of this we did.  And the people on the street.  And the people that we meet.  This makes me feel like Christmas.  Yeah, this makes me want to eat a sugar cookie.  It really does.  Commit a sodomy outside of school.  With a Santa hat on.  With a Santa hat. 
[01:36:00]  This makes me want to lure a youngster to my vehicle in a Santa hat.  Show him my Peter.  What do you think of them apples?  Yeah, exactly.  Peter.  Yeah, if I smear eggnog on the helmet.  Let's fade this out, I guess.  What were we singing about when we did the cover of this?  I heard it not recently.  Was it, let's see.  It just made me laugh because I heard it.  It was just mean.  Anybody down there remember?  As I look at the...  Yeah. 
[01:36:30]  We were using alternate lyrics.  Of course we were.  That's half the gags we do here.  Can we break?  No one recollects, huh?  We'll figure it out.  We'll figure it out.  We'll have the answer after the break.  La la la la.  Kenny better get me some yogurt.  La la.  I'd like to have some blueberries.  La la la la.  Get me a little bit of...  What is that shit called that you put inside?  La la la.  The crunchy stuff I like.  La la la.  No la. 
[01:37:00]  No la la la.  My granola la la la.  Nice vomit colored jacket.  Fa la la la la.  Look like you pulled that off the fucking...  Looks like the priest wore that on his neck and the exorcist.  Fa la la la la.  You're dressed like an idiot.  Fa la la la la.  Loose fitting cadaver jacket.  La la la la.  Stupid stiff cop shoes.  Fa la la la la.  Dry haired idiot.  Fa la la la la. 
[01:37:30]  The people skills of a hornet.  Fa la la la la.  Sound like lurch.  Fa la la la la.  You're just unpleasant.  Fa la la la la.  Even people who like you don't like you.  La la.  I'm fucking kidding.  Attention to details, but no human interaction.  La la la la's. 
[01:38:00]  Holy shit.  You walk with an idiot's gate for la la la.  I can't even look down.  Holy fuck, man.  You know you threw off his whole day today?  You have no idea?  That's classic.  I was in the car, and I was checking my Twitter,  and I read your Reverend Al Sharpton tweet.  And I went, oh, Jimmy has landed.  And it was 538.  Probably in that area, right?  No. 
[01:38:30]  That's what's important.  532.  I go, oh, Jimmy landed.  Kenny goes, he's not supposed to land until 537.  Oh, boy.  And I looked down.  I'm like, that's going to fucking ruin your day now, isn't it?  Because he didn't land properly.  Obsessed with the numbers, fa-la-la-la-la.  Wouldn't know a hug if he tripped over it, la-la.  But he can give you numbers, fa-la-la-la-la.  Knocking all the jigs with a nightstick, la-la.  Knocking people up with a phone book, la-la.  Look, he misses those good old days, fa-la-la. 
[01:39:00]  So we all have to suffer, fa-la-la-la-la.  Because he can't beat up people, la-la-la-la.  Black shoes with black laces, fa-la-la-la-la.  Head like a Doberman, la-la-la-la.  His Jeep looks like it just drove off the showroom, la-la-la.  Obsessed with neatness, fa-la-la-la-la.  Hasn't eaten a salad since 1970, la-la-la. 
[01:39:30]  Shits are hard like pebbles, fa-la-la-la-la.  Little asphalt duties, fa-la-la-la-la.  Have a glass of water, ya la-la-la-la.  He doesn't even drink water.  Doesn't even have an iPod, la-la-la-la.  Could fall asleep during a nuclear attack, fa-la-la.  Wakes everyone up with his apnea, la-la.  Oh, fuck.  Why do we beat up the ones we love? 
[01:40:00]  Why do we do it?  Oh, my God.  He breathes like Travis's dog, la-la-la-la.  You did the suit color, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Of course.  Suit like vomit.  That really is awful.  He's a Doberman.  It's awful.  He's a Doberman without the ears.  Danny just put a Doberman picture.  He's a Doberman without the ears.  Hey, it's uncanny.  Unless you go sideways, then he's the angelfish. 
[01:40:30]  He's a dog from the omen, fa-la-la-la-la.  Looking out for Damien, fa-la-la-la-la.  Here he comes.  Look at him.  Oh, my God.  Jesus Christ.  He's got a gate like Sasquatch.  Fa-la-la-la-la-la.  Jacket color of boogers, fa-la-la-la-la.  He said, I'll take a size 52 in flu, fa-la-la-la.  Do you have any flu-covered coats, colored boo, fa-la-la-la-la? 
[01:41:00]  Oh, hi, Kenny.  Hey, Kenny.  Thank you.  Hi.  Somebody pissed on my blueberries, la-la-la-la-la.  Oh, fuck.  Holy shit, that was funny.  Are you done?  Is that what you want to say?  No, you keep going for another two hours. 
[01:41:30]  He could.  I'm hoping he does.  Oh, just flu.  Let's work for us.  That is a fine suit, I think.  Flu.  That's up.  His flu-colored jacket.  Oh, Kenny.  Sorry.  It's hard to do when you're in the room. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  Can you leave the room?  Yeah, just for a second.  Just for a second.  Okay, there you go.  Listen with your earpiece, fa-la-la-la-la, like you're in the Secret Service, but you're  not la-la-la, you're guarding this hacky radio show, la-la-la.  Yeah, threat level zero.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Big clumsy fingers on a Blackberry, la-la.  Always typing double letters, la-la-la-la.  Exactly five meatballs, fa-la-la-la-la. 
[01:42:30]  Exact number of scoops, fa-la-la-la-la.  Holy shit.  Did he do the grilled chicken thing?  That's all he eats.  No, does he?  Oh, my God.  Nothing but just plain grilled chicken.  Never a vegetable.  And he'll treat himself to maybe a potato every once in a while.  Oh, God.  It's the same.  We'll go to these amazing restaurants, and he orders the worst thing possible. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, God damn.  Wow.  Well, you know, it's when you point it out in song like that, Jimmy, that it really all  comes together.  But he was bothered that you landed before 537, and I asked him, is this going to ruin your  day?  I never got the answer, by the way.  I think he was a little annoyed by me.  Because something changes in him when the number isn't exact.  That was very good.  He gives Jimmy a wake-up call at 530, and if it's 531, he is so bothered that he missed  the 530. 
[01:43:30]  First voice you hear of the day, la, la, la.  Good luck not being manically depressed, la, la, la.  It's like the Grim Reaper chatting with you, la, la, la, la.  65 mini ketchups, la, la, la, la.  He loves those little fond of his...  He's a hoarder and doesn't know it, la, la, la, la.  Saves everything but fun, la, la, la.  He couldn't find a hug if he tripped over him. 
[01:44:00]  There's no affection there whatsoever.  Not at all.  He's like a talking Venus flytrap for la, la, la, la.  Did he do the invoice one yet?  An invoice like the New York Times, la, la, la, la.  Sunday edition for la, la, la, la.  We get these invoices from Kenny.  It's like we trust you.  Just fucking build us.  They are exact.  They're exact to the penny. 
[01:44:30]  To the penny they're exact.  Kenny's a great record keeper.  Oh, my God.  I got work.  Food.  Yes.  Travel.  Hotel.  I'll ask him to maybe, you know, do something over the week.  I can.  I got a lot of paperwork to catch up on.  Paperwork.  And it's these invoices that we already trust them.  They got me pushing a pencil.  It's you.  Who's they?  Exactly.  That's lots of crayon.  Probably I'm pushing in your eye.  Exactly. 
[01:45:00]  Fuck.  Oh, boy.  I say we go home early because it's not going to get better than what Jimmy just did.  That's about it, right?  What are you thinking?  I'm game.  Is our boss still in Africa?  I guess.  Oh, God.  I bless malaria in Africa.  Hey, there's horrible things that could happen in Africa.  I'm rooting lion.  Lion attack?  I'm rooting for lion this time around.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:45:30]  I don't know.  Maybe some of that fucking...  What do you think?  Some of that Ebola.  That hits pretty quick.  Oh, yeah.  That'd be great.  The doctor could sit there and go, yeah, you got it.  You got it.  You got it.  You got it.  His blood's coming out of his eyes.  One minute, you're waving at a rhino.  The next minute, another pair of white pants spoiled.  Oh, boy.  This is not good.  I knew I shouldn't have shared that banana with a monkey.  They warned me against that.  But he offered it to me, and I took one from the little fella. 
[01:46:00]  What would be the worst...  Bleeding banana fucking monkey gums.  What would be the worst trampling, you think, in Africa?  Oh, Bob Kelly on his way to the buffet.  What, do you go rhino over elephant?  I'd go rhino over elephant.  Elephants are six tons.  But there's room under an elephant where you can maybe, you know...  When elephants put their head down and fucking, like, start bashing you with that giant fucking...  Show me a rhino.  ...Rocky Dennis skull.  I think you could survive...  Fucking elephants and those big, giant heads. 
[01:46:30]  I think if an elephant's coming at you, you could make some moves and survive possibly a trampling.  I hear hippos, though, are worse than anything.  Hippos?  Like, hippos kill more people where there's hippos than any other animal.  Yeah, but you know why?  It's because they look so friendly in Hungry Hungry Hippo.  The people think they can walk up and fuck them at the watering hole.  They try to feed them marbles.  Do you know how many hippos turn around and bite men trying to fuck them in the ass at the watering hole?  Because people see the little fucking bird on the tail.  They're like, oh, this is a friendly animal.  It's got to be friendly. 
[01:47:00]  I like to be fun.  Birds fucking them.  I might as well join in.  They got some...  Oh, my God.  Like, that mouth is...  Would you deal with that?  It looks like fucking Predator.  It looks like a horseshoe crab.  It looks like Shane McGowan.  Oh, my God.  That's a great callback.  Yeah, from 10 years ago.  Fucking...  Oh, you know.  He's had new teeth since the 60s.  That's not nice.  Yeah, I see some little racist picture there.  Oh, I see.  Why is that racist?  If the guy looks like... 
[01:47:30]  I don't know.  He's got a hippo mouth.  He looks like a hippo mouth.  How is that racist?  There's a picture of that black guy with his mouth open real wide wearing the straw hat.  Yeah.  Because it's one of them moobily boobily pictures from the oldie days.  But it looks just like a hippo with his mouth open.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Do, do, do, do, do, do.  Yeah, that would, uh...  I think elephants.  When you watch some of those, when animals attack things, and you see an elephant, like,  fucking some guy up, you can't get away from him. 
[01:48:00]  Like, the guy's trying to stand up and run, and the elephant just, boar, and hits him with  his big, giant head.  Right.  Picture your Escalade jumping on you.  Yeah.  On purpose.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Elephant?  That would do it.  And it's not lazy when it, when it doesn't, you know, when it, it's not, whatever, yeah.  No, it, it, it is, those things are fucking deadly when they get pissed.  But usually it's just slow and lazy until it has to take care of something.  Then they got some get up and go.  Oh, yeah, they got get up and go.  Yes. 
[01:48:30]  All right.  Oh, wow, that was funny.  Couch of zilchers today in a half hour.  Great.  Kenny treats those people nice, right?  When they come in?  He reads them the riot act before they come in.  Yeah.  They're so scared, they don't even want to talk.  The whole, the whole object of the couch of zilchers, by the way, is to have people come  in off the street.  And relax.  Because we can't have a live, live audience.  Relax and enjoy themselves for an hour.  Enjoy themselves, talk about themselves, shit like that.  But, uh, Kenny tells them, just shut your mouths and sit there.  There are guests, fa-la-la-la-la. 
[01:49:00]  You shove them into boxcars, fa-la-la-la-la.  Send them off to family camp, fa-la-la-la-la.  Supposed to be fun, fa-la-la-la.  They have a nice experience, don't they?  Yeah, but it's like half the time we're spent trying to fucking deprogram them so they  could talk.  Wow, animals, look at these fucking elephants just swimming in deep water.  I love when elephants, I love when trainers get trampled.  I love when animal trainers get trampled. 
[01:49:30]  It is great.  What would you think that was if you were in the water?  I wouldn't even know what the fuck that was.  I think it was a dinosaur, and I sure would be that close to it.  Yeah, our fans.  You're on a pool party.  It's the beach party right there.  There it is.  You see, because you're all fat fucks.  Why are you doing that?  Why not?  Ricks, they know who they are. 
[01:50:00]  Look down.  See no dick?  You're fat.  Oh, yeah, that would.  Look at that shit.  That guy's in a boat.  A little boat.  Next to a fuckload of elephants.  With no motor.  No, they're rowing this fucking boat.  Oh, shit.  That's a giant bull elephant now.  Saying, fuck you.  And he's got his ears going, so he's pissed.  He's walking towards them on this.  Yeah.  That's like the head.  Fuck you.  What are you doing?  That's the head muckety-muck of the elephants there, and he's got to protect the... 
[01:50:30]  He's kicking dirt at them.  Look at the little baby one.  It's like little babar.  I don't know what that elephant's thought process was, but I bet those guys in that boat are  really, really glad that he decided to...  He was just like, ah, fuck it, and went somewhere else.  He was like, I'm going to fuck you up.  They throw shit.  Like, oh, yeah.  Okay, this elephant's pissed.  Now it's going after the boat.  And the camera went down.  They're rowing away.  No more fucking taking cute video. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, the camera's in the water.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  What happened there?  That's it.  What happened there?  That elephant stomped them motherfuckers.  But they got the camera, obviously.  Yeah.  We got the video.  Well, if you look at it, it's Elif Dash Ant's YouTube page.  It says Big Clumsy Ants.  He can't type good.  He started to be on the way to the Danny Bonaduce show.  Yes, I was trying to have flames put on my big ears. 
[01:51:30]  And logos.  Logos.  Elephants.  There's a lot of elephant attacking videos, huh?  Look at it.  Oh, she's riding it.  That's good.  That's good, right?  I love those countries where they ride elephants.  It's not like Indiana Jones, is it?  Do you know how much it must suck when you're riding an elephant and it goes ballistic?  Wow.  And you know that the one person it wants to get is you.  Is you and you're on the back?  Yeah, you gotta hang on now for dear life.  You know that elephant is not gonna let you off gingerly. 
[01:52:00]  Look, he's rubbing his head against the ceiling trying to knock this person off.  Thank God it's made of fucking straw.  Yeah, exactly.  Savage has never read the fucking three...  What were they?  Three pigs?  Oh, yeah.  Three little pigs.  He's fucking...  Again, talking about the audience.  He's smashing his head.  I am calling from my straw house.  Look out.  He is smashing his head into the ceiling to knock this guy off.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  He's sick of being ridden by these fucking assholes.  It's now busting through a metal locked gate.  Oh, boy. 
[01:52:30]  That's an awful ride.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  This is a good one.  Oh, now he's going through a door to try to get the guy off him?  Yeah.  That, uh...  Oh, God.  Where's the guy?  Must have fallen off.  And they can move pretty fucking fast.  They're fucking...  They're big, but you don't realize how much ground they're...  These in the village is wreaking havoc.  Do you know how much it must suck when you look out the door and there's an elephant climbing  the steps?  With big, awful tusks.  Thank God they have, like, shit villages. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  They made a paper.  They can get $11 worth of damage.  Six-hour rampage.  He killed 35 people with an earning potential of $1.75.  He killed everyone in the village, but two goats and the fucking...  The economy wasn't affected.  Look at that thing just burst through a wall.  Oh, man.  It's fucking that thing up.  Is that a guy?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, now he's a stomper.  He stepped on someone.  Oh, I think I'm stomped.  Watch this shit.  Did he fucking back... 
[01:53:30]  Did he back kick the guy?  Yeah.  First...  First...  Head first with the tusk.  Look at this shit.  Right through a wall.  Boom.  And then...  Oh, my God.  And then scramps him like a cat burying his shit.  And then they kneel down on top of the fucking...  That guy's got to be dead.  He's dead.  He's stomping him with his back foot now.  He's knocking him back and forth.  That's six tons of elephant.  Oh, shit.  Knocking that guy back and forth in between his footsies.  Oh, man.  And what?  Why are they... 
[01:54:00]  What are they burning?  I guess...  Well, they have to burn the elephant.  They've got to do something to stop the elephant.  I think they put fire there so it can't...  It won't walk through the gate again.  Oh, man.  So they probably lit up a fire.  Yeah.  That's their primitive way of...  Stop, elephants!  Doesn't work.  Oh, man.  There's that fucking ugly lady who got stomped.  Jeez.  Her head split open pretty good.  Of course it is.  I bet you it was the smell of her pussy that was driving him bonkers.  And he just wanted her dead.  Because she would probably...  Like, her pussy probably stunk so bad.  And she would always fucking practice her yoga right by his thing. 
[01:54:30]  And he couldn't take it anymore.  Right by his trunk.  He would always try to fish in there and get hay in there.  Plug it up with hay or something.  Because her fucking third world pussy smelled offensive.  He's like, I just got to stomp this bitch.  It smelled like a seagull nest.  And he was like, where is this lady?  I'm going to fucking kick her around and show her who's boss.  Stinky cut McGillicuddy.  Fucking wrecking my vibe out here.  The elephant always knew when her yoga was dark is the birds would fly off his back. 
[01:55:00]  They couldn't even take it.  Her rotten pussy.  He was trying to kick dirt into it.  Fucking plug in a hole.  He saw the road crew fucking plug it up holes.  He's like, yeah, that'll work.  Yeah, I know how to do this.  Yeah, well, she goes to the downward dog.  I'm going to kick her in the fucking face.  I'm going to kick this pig into a wall.  Next time she does fucking wound.  The fucking, what's the warrior pose?  Next time she goes on a warrior one, I'm going to kick her tits off. 
[01:55:30]  And he did.  Back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.  He really was playing soccer with himself.  Yeah, playing hacky fucking.  Hacky dead lady.  Hacky savage.  Hacky savage.  Holy shit.  Oh my God.  What a disaster.  Oh, that was great.  You're like, well, here's one bodega worker that won't stick up anybody else's pen.  Fucking rotten pussy.  I bet her pussy was still alive.  She was dead with the pussy crawled off and left. 
[01:56:00]  To stick up another town.  Her pussy is the fucking kid from Apocalypto.  That fucking scared all the fucking guys when they walked by.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, her vagina's awful.  Elephant had to get to her.  He couldn't take it anymore.  That's that village's version of Network.  The movie with fucking Peter Finch.  Pussy crawls off.  Pussy crawls off like that spider head thing from The Thing.  I wish there was a trailer for it, by the way. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, really?  Slash film, October 14th.  Nice.  Fuck yeah.  That's funny shit.  We should break.  You find the Brian Regan thing?  I need some water, fuck.  All right, no worries.  We'll just go to break then.  Oh, fuck.  I remember Babar when I was a kid.  Babar, the baby elephant.  I loved Babar.  Yeah.  Now I don't.  Now he's not taking us to commercials.  Whenever I see Babar, I try to play the piano with its fucking face. 
[01:57:00]  Hey, can we make a trinket out of that fucking thing that nature gave you to defend yourself?  Tickle the old ivories with a 308.  You know what I like to do out of elephant trunks?  I like to fucking have them melted down and just make things that spell my name.  I like to make letters out of elephant trunks and write Jim and just put it on my table and  then I knock it on the floor.  With no care or regard as to where it came from.  I make luggage out of their big, dumb feet and I put giant fucking Mardi Gras hats in  their fucking Kentucky Derby hats.  I hollow out their fucking idiotic feet, leaving their footless. 
[01:57:30]  Get someone to wait on, you shithead.  They really do have dumb tree stump feet.  They're awful.  Perfectly.  A hat box.  Hey, hat box feet, get over here.  Do you want to make it out of their tails?  I make fucking things I can swing over my head and go, woo!  Woo!  I do, I have their fucking tails lopped off, just so I can swing them over my head and  make rodeo noises. 
[01:58:00]  I got a fucking head.  Oh, fuck, look at those dumb feet.  Oh, God, there's a guy with elephant feet.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that guy's an asshole.  There's a guy from another...  His fucking feet are horrendous.  I would just, if I was him, I would just walk into foot lockers all day.  Hey, just watch the staff go, holy shit.  They'd worship him. 
[01:58:30]  You measure these.  Holy shit.  You're hoping that thing tears off and goes to market.  The other one made me have a little roast beef.  And the other one goes, wee, wee, wee, all the way home.  Because his toes are giant.  His feet are...  That's that giant leg shit.  Holy shit.  It starts right up...  He's got Hillary Clintonitis.  That's a technical name for it.  It has cankles.  Right above his knees it starts, and then they just get gigantic. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, the rest of his body's normal.  His calves and stuff.  Remember the English broad?  We did this bit.  Yeah.  The English broad, where her legs weigh, I don't know, 200 pounds or something.  And the rest of her is completely normal.  She's actually small up top.  Imagine taking a Q-tip into those folds.  Oh, God.  And wonder what would you pull out.  Or just peel them open and smell.  And smell inside.  Just try bugs in them.  Oh, God.  Hate to buy socks for him.  Imagine buying socks. 
[01:59:30]  How big you'd have to get them on the bottom.  Normal, tapered knee.  Can't get them on.  Yeah, exactly.  It's like, oh, fuck.  One for each toe.  On his toe.  Looks like his socks are wearing Santa hats.  His feet, whatever they are.  I'm tired.  Whatever the fuck they are.  Yeah, those.  I'd like to fucking whip his foot for no reason while he sits there begging for money.  Yeah, because he can't run away.  Those gargantuan things.  I'd love to see him moonwalk, breakdance.  It's probably a great breakdance.  I bet you he tries to focus on his hands all the time. 
[02:00:00]  Like, whenever he talks, he probably gestures wildly.  So you look at his hands.  Just so you look at his hands.  He probably claps a lot.  All right, let's get things going.  Snaps does all these things to make you focus up.  He sends out photos behind his computer from the waist up.  Girls think he's hot.  He's like, there's something I got to tell you.  Like, as they're coming up the front step, he texts them.  My feet are a little big.  What do you mean?  You'll see as soon as you walk in.  When you open the door and there's something, like, in the doorway.  It's my foot.  Sorry.  He'd make a good vacuum salesman when they try to slam the door in his face. 
[02:00:30]  And he shoves his foot in there.  He can shove the whole vacuum in.  You put your right leg in, and then no one else does the hokey pokey.  You put your left leg in, and you clear the room out.  Oh, God.  You put your right leg in, you put your right leg, you shake it, and you knock stuff off 
[02:01:00]  the walls, and the shingles fall off the roof, because you're a big-legged idiot.  Nice legs, dick.  I'd love to just jump on his leg.  You know how fucking much that would hurt?  It would probably hurt him very much.  A lot.  Big log-leg motherfucker.  Yeah, they got all those disgusting folds in him and everything.  Yeah, we'll sit on a towel.  Look at him showing off.  I bet you he likes his legs.  He thinks he looks sexy.  That's why he rolls his pant leg up like he's got knickers on. 
[02:01:30]  He's going to the fucking ocean in 1910.  He does have cartoon character legs.  I know.  He's big, burly.  You know who he looks like?  He looks like Mega Man.  He's a big fan of the Fantastic Four.  He does.  Yeah, he's got those big fucking legs.  Bravo.  There you go.  Just fucking paint him blue.  I would dress up like that.  Yeah.  Another person that could just enjoy themselves on Halloween. 
[02:02:00]  It's a great costume.  What are you supposed to be?  An outcast?  Social pariah?  Yeah.  You know, mother with giant pussy.  I bet you she thought she was, you know what, when she had him, because the head and shoulders,  she's like, oh, a nice healthy baby.  And then she's like, wait a minute.  And them fucking feet probably wrecked her cunt.  She was so close to having a good one.  Same sound as Velcro ripping.  From tailbone to belly button.  Yeah, here's the father watching the kid. 
[02:02:30]  Big giant athlete's vagina.  Her pussy is ruined.  He should get a job making wine.  It's just gallons pouring out every second.  Yeah, that's him sitting outside the Paul Masson place.  He's in Martha's Vineyard, actually.  Well, he is disgusting.  Yes, he certainly is.  It's not a part of his body that doesn't smell. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I need water.  It has a good boy's phone and it's not a boy's phone.  I'm not here by his phone and he's a good boy's phone.  It's a good boy's phone and it's not a boy's phone.  I'm not here by his phone and he's a good boy's phone.  It's a good boy's phone and it's not a boy's phone and it's not a boy's phone. 
[02:03:30]  It has a good boy's phone and it's not a boy's phone.  The Virus Sirius XM 
[02:04:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show  Opie and Anthony  It's almost Couch of Zilch's time  I see Stark or Patty stop by  Why?  We watched her walk down the hall 
[02:04:30]  But why did she stop by?  Just to say hi or something?  She's not part of our show anymore  Just because I figured I'd say hello  You want to bring her in first?  And then we got  David from Israel  Who calls the show a lot  He's in New York obviously  And he decided to stop by and say hi to us  You want to go with Patty first?  And then slowly get the Couch of Zilch's in here  That sounds good  And we also have Bobo outside  Holding an envelope  What? 
[02:05:00]  Oh, I know it's in there  Patty  Patty  I really want to know why she stopped by  Well, you can ask her  She's right here  Hey Patty, why didn't you stop by?

You're looking annoyed today  Are you happy to be here?  Yeah, I mean, I just came by to say hello  Yeah, but it's weird just to stop by and say hello  Why'd you scuff your shoe, though?  Hello, is it me you're looking for?  Cause I wonder where you were  Wait, when she says it's me you're looking for?

[03:23:30]  This is just  Fucking useless  I know  We have a  Fucking retarded guy  Humping the air  With pre-cum  And his awful  European underpants  Time for the chair  Of honor Jimmy  Yeah  Even though David  From Israel  But I think  We would have to  Yes sir  I would have to  Jimmy  Well I got the song  And everything  So  Jimmy has been  Paying attention  The entire time  And one of these  Fine 
[03:24:00]  People get to sit  In the chair of honor  Chair of honor  For  Congratulations  It's afterwards  It's after  I thought it was  The big song before  Oh no  Spoiler alert  Oh  I'm sorry  That's okay  Alright Jimmy  It's time to pick  The winner of the chair  A quick analysis  They're all very good  Zilches  I don't remember  The guy on the end's name  With the calves  But you were good  You acknowledged  That your calves were large  But the hair on your leg 
[03:24:30]  Prevents me from putting you  Oh wow  Yeah  Your legs are a little  Criteria is very  Very tough  Very tight  And what do you call  What you do  A sommelier  A sommelier  I don't like that word  No  So I'll probably disqualify you  From the couch  Zilches  I mean from the chair of honor  You're welcome to stay  On the couch  Yes of course  The Val Kilmer guy  I do admire the fact  That you lost a lot of weight  But the fact that  You know  You did it only because 
[03:25:00]  You had fucking boulders  In your gallbladder  Disqualifies you  From the couch  Oh wow  The chair of honor  Oh  Now it's a tough call  Because we have Adrian  Who's very sexy  But the fact that  She's wearing boots  Like a Star Wars figure  Makes me disqualify her  And she's married  And would not poke the penis  Of a blithering idiot  Right  Sorry  That's okay  That disqualifies her  Oh man  And now we have  And now we have Brie 
[03:25:30]  Well what about Bobo  Well I haven't gotten  To Bobo yet  And what about Dave  From Israel  Well I haven't gotten  To him  And Patty  I haven't gotten  Alright I'm sorry  I'm sorry  Oh no I'm going meticulously  Now Brie  There's a question  You know what you're doing  I'm sorry  Can I  Would I be able  To suck on your breasts  Wow  Um no  It's an automatic  Disqualification  From the chair of honor  That is tough  To humiliate one of the hosts  In such a vicious fashion  It's terrible  With such mean spiritedness  At her tender young age  Patty  Yeah 
[03:26:00]  Exactly  No chair of honor for you  Well well  Give her one more chance  To poke the penis  Will you poke Bobo's penis  I don't want to touch him  Well you want the chair of honor  Don't you  Do you want the chair of honor  Everyone wants the chair of honor  For Pete's sake  You got your picture on the wall  Like they do in restaurants  It's huge  I don't want to  I  Patty  Oh  Patty  Patty  Patty  Patty  Chair of honor  Patty  Chair of honor  Chair of honor  Patty  Patty 
[03:26:30]  I don't deserve the chair of honor  No you really don't  Unless it  Unless it's the passenger seat  In Harry Chapin's car  Unless there's 20,000 volts  Going through it  Yes  Or unless it's a fucking  Toilet with a plunger in it  That you deserve to be  Fucking thrust out of the chair of honor  By Hulk Hogan  So I would say  Who do we have that belongs in the chair of honor  Who do you think  We have 
[03:27:00]  It's down to David from Israel and Bobo  Blow blow  Blow blow  Didn't we  Sitting on this chair  And all that  Oh no he's penciled back up  Okay  Bobo  Yeah that's true  How bad do you want the chair of honor  I want it badly  Speak from your heart  Speak from your heart  Tell it like it is  I've been trying to get that honor for the past two  Three weeks  Wow  Really working a lifetime on that one  Huh  Jeez  And I was really upset when the internet wasn't working at my house  That's what you say it wasn't working  I thought I was going to go on Facebook 
[03:27:30]  You say it was  According to Danny it was working and you're lying  It really isn't working  That's not what Danny's been telling us  Yeah but he doesn't live in my house  But he's been saying that your internet's working fine  I've been on the internet someplace else  Oh  According to Danny it's been at home  No I wasn't at home  So I guess Danny's a liar  Yeah  You're calling me a fucking liar  My case is because I wasn't at home  The times I was on the internet this week  Alright well David did travel a long way though  He sure did Jimmy 
[03:28:00]  From Israel  From Israel  And he is a regular contributor to this program  Yes  Unlike you Bobo  And he gives us a lot of our Jewish facts that we don't know  Yes  Unlike you Bobo  The guy's useful  Yes  We will know something about Israel  He will call up and give a very unbiased opinion of the Golan Heights  Jesus  He is essential to the O.B. and Anthony effort  Yes  That's what we like  Wow  Fuck that's funny  So I don't know  David's already sitting in the chair of honor  Don't you think he looks good there Bobo? 
[03:28:30]  He looks like he's been sitting there for a while  Yeah almost comfortable right?  Yeah  Very natural  Yeah  How much does that bother you Bobo?  You're not speaking your mind  That's your chair and David's sitting in it  Yeah it does bother me  I mean he's sitting there and I tried to get this for  He's sitting there  Why?  Just because you've tried for a while doesn't mean it's good  What makes you worthy of it?  And him not  I'm not sure  I've been trying to get that honor for a while  Trying to get what?  The chair of honor 
[03:29:00]  For a while  Yeah yeah but it doesn't matter  That you've been for a while  What makes you more qualified for the chair of honor  Than Dave from Israel?  I don't know  I did  I've done most of my stuff  If I was willing to drop my pants there  And what did he do right?  Ask that question today Bobo  He didn't do anything  He wasn't willing to drop his pants  He's been in many heated discussions with some Palestinians  That is true  And he gave us some very good radio  And Bobo you don't understand 
[03:29:30]  He never had to take his pants off  This could be your last chance at the chair of honor for a while  Right  Because we only have five, six slots every week  Right  And we're not going to come back to you anytime soon  Because we've got a lot of people on the waiting list  It's going to be difficult  Probably been trying to get in front of her right  I mean I was willing to  I was willing to probably embarrass myself on the show today  What?  How?  Probably  Oh the air humping  Everyone can do air guitar  You just air hump 
[03:30:00]  Oh David's just burying you  Yeah  Give David a mic  This could get ugly  Yeah  Bobo you've got to fight for the chair of honor  Yeah Bobo come on  You don't care about it  Speak your mind  I really did that  I really did that  Not for myself  Because I really did that for the show  That's why I did that  For the show  For the show  Yeah but you pretty much made all the ladies feel uncomfortable  What the show was to a halt  Nobody wanted to see that shit  Nobody wanted to see your ass crack  Oh man  I don't care  I'm screwed for life now  Oh  Like you're seeing that shit 
[03:30:30]  Oh man  I didn't really want to  I didn't really want to make any ladies uncomfortable there  I did that  Then you shouldn't have even showed up in the first place  Oh shit  Oh man  You better speak your mind Bobo  I did that for the show  I went  Man  He's nailing you Bobo  I went and I rushed to get here  Doesn't matter  He came here from Israel  So shut up about rushing from Queens  He's saying he took  The chair of honor  And deserves it  Yeah he sat down in it  Without us even giving it to him  Just knowing he'd probably get it  That's how confident he is 
[03:31:00]  You're busy humping the air  And playing games  And somebody's going after the chair of honor  His quest  Yeah well then  I don't know  It doesn't make sense  They think you're supposed to be awarded it first  Before you sit in it  Well part of the award  I think is the courage he had  In sitting there  Knowing he would probably get it  But not you  I'm the Bobo motherfucker  All you do was  Oh shit  All you do was show up  I worked for this  Oh fuck  Yeah but you didn't work much  All you showed was maybe two and a half inches 
[03:31:30]  It's getting mad  Oh and the comedy's flying  Listen here that's my fucking chair  And I'm sitting in it bitch  That's not the worst  Listen here  No that  What  Alright listen  He  That's my fucking chair  He goes listen here  And I got good pen  Jesus  Listen you jaw bastard  Listen you carp 
[03:32:00]  What happened Bobo  How'd you lose  I don't know  I freaking lost a chair  To a guy  That looks like  The freaking  Looks like the freaking  Deli guy  Oh  Man  Anti-Semitic  Yeah see that won't get you  Right there  The deli guy  Like a Jewish deli right  No not just any deli  Specifically  He just happens to look like  The same person  I buy sandwiches from  Oh wow  That's funny then 
[03:32:30]  When you say  I like this guy  It's not even a joke  Literally  He looks like his deli guy  I don't know much  About that  About the guy  About the guy  In deli department  I just know  That he looks like  No  Why would you  I don't know Bobo  Huh  I know  It's just  Mind boggling  Alright well  Jimmy you gotta decide  I mean you know  I think  This is really important  My vote is Bobo  But I think  That Danny  Made a point  Of he's able 
[03:33:00]  To override me  And he said  That it had to be  David  So I would have  Voted for Bobo  But Danny  Felt that it should  Be David  Yep  And he felt  That Bobo  Was just not  Bringing it  And doesn't really  Want the chair  Yeah you could tell  It doesn't want  Maybe next time  We gave you a chance  To fight for it  And I do want it  So Danny  I will acquiesce  To your wish  You didn't fight  Yeah  The bow just  Didn't have it  In him today  You want to try  To take that chair  Yeah  Bobo  Yeah  Go try to  Take that chair  Not physically 
[03:33:30]  Oh shit  Where are you doing  Maniac  I'll kick your ass  Yeah David  Might have bombs  Struck to him  Yes David will  Jump up and just  Litigate with you  Been in the military  Since he was six  Exactly  He knows some moves  They work over there  Yeah  He said he was  In the massage  Alright well  I guess  Sorry Bobo  I mean it's not  My fault  I wanted to give it  To you and so  Did the guys  But Danny says  No and it's no  And as you can see  All the other chairs  Are taken  So you know what to do

[03:43:30]  And Bobo ripped the paper  Luckily, I didn't rip up the barcode  Luckily, I didn't rip up the barcode  That's no good  That's no good anymore  They won't take that  Why'd you rip Bobo's ticket off?  Why'd you rip the ticket?  The barcode will work  The barcode will work  Oh, Bobo  You made him rip his own ticket off  I think the barcode will work  Bobo, you ripped in half  Bobo, why'd you rip the ticket?  It was an accident  I didn't really think it was in there  The barcode  No, no one will take it  No one will take it  Did Danny put that in there? 
[03:44:00]  We put the ticket  In the middle of the paper  He couldn't have ripped it  In a better spot  Did someone  Anybody who was in the Mets  Who could answer the question  Would the ticket still work?  Would the barcode still work?  No, they won't take it  To rip that ticket  They won't  Bobo, I'm not going  I'm not going all the way to the stadium  Where the ticket ripped in half  Because there's a real good chance  That they're not going to take it  They ripped the tickets when you go in  Did someone call in?  No, no one's calling  We're busy  Why didn't Danny put it in there? 
[03:44:30]  Bob, you know if the ticket would work  If it got accidentally ripped  But not the  No, it got  It didn't get to the part  Bobo, why'd you rip the ticket in half?  Why'd you do that?  You're the one that did it, Bobo  You did it  Hold on, let me  This ticket didn't get ripped up  Right, it accidentally got ripped up  I would have won it, Bobo  Bobo  Alright, OB's gone 
[03:45:00]  Yeah, I think I'm going to get out of here  If that's the case  No one's going to the game  Alright, no games  We're just hanging, fuck it  Well, if that's the case  Shannon  I'm done  Later, Bobo  Gordon, my sister  Hope you and you  If you're listening  Later, Bobo  And if not, I'll make you listen to the replay  You and your worthless tickets  Yeah, I am going to have to address you as OB the entire game  Alright  Alright, yeah, yeah  Later, later  I've had it with you  Yeah, this ticket got ripped  I got tricked into ripping the ticket 
[03:45:30]  Yeah, now I'm going to have to call to ask if they can replace this  I just called them  If you tape it together, they'll be fine  Alright, alright, well  Alright, and here's 20 bucks for your ripped underwear  Alright  I'll tape to get his ticket and see if it works  Alright 
[03:46:00]  I was just told the ticket will work fine  All you have to do is give this to OB and it will work  Just found out that the ticket will work fine  I'm shocked OB doesn't believe me  I said it'll work fine  The barcode will work fine  Thing will work fine  Let me see my Twitter  Stick it will work fine 
[03:46:30]  Just to be taped together, it'll work fine  Yeah, this is After ONA Live  Sam's not here  So I'm hosting  I'm sure you heard an eventful end of the show  Because of this whole issue  Over this one MET ticket  One of two MET tickets I had 
[03:47:00]  My friend would have took care of  Would have upgraded these seats  As you know, if OB would have gone  Forcedly didn't go  Didn't believe that this ticket would work  Supposedly I heard from a source  Kenny said that someone from the MET's organization  Said that this ticket would work  But I'm trying to get  I'm trying to see if anyone from the MET's organization  Could call and confirm that this ticket would work  The part with the barcode  Wasn't ripped up  The phone number is  866-969-1969  I'm sure there's someone in the MET's organization listening 
[03:47:30]  Absolutely  Well, the phones are ringing  Once we get those screened, buddy  We're gonna figure this out for you  Yeah, somebody would know  If this ticket works, alright  You wanna just take them dry?  We'll just take dry phones, I think  Alright, let's see  Hey, Buster, you're on the air, man  Hey, where's Sam?  Enough of them fucking horror commercials  Get on the air  Sam's not here today  Alright, next caller  You're on the air  Hi, this is Mr. Jackson from the IRS  Yeah  Um, I would like to speak with Mr. Daniel Kerlin, please 
[03:48:00]  Okay, you got him  Bobo, say hi  I'm wondering what the value of those tickets were  That were given to Mr. Kerlin as a gift  Now, these two tickets I have here  These were just cheap tickets  They were worth $25  $45?  $25  $25 a piece  Yeah  So the total cost would be $50, correct?  Yeah  Okay  According to the current IRS code 
[03:48:30]  There is a 53% gift tax  That is required to be paid on any gifts received in the United States  Bobo, you got the money for that?  I don't get the money for that damn tax  Okay, what you're going to have to do is  You're going to have to get your money together  And we're probably going to run an audit  How long have you been receiving gifts?  No, I received these tickets 
[03:49:00]  I received these tickets a month  Two months ago  Have you received other gifts?  Have you won anything on the air?  I don't know  There's that XM subscription I got  Okay, Mr. Kerlin  What I'm going to have to do is  Get a hold of my colleagues  And we'll be contacting you  In the near future  We're probably going to have to audit you back  Three years  Thanks, IRS  Have a good one  Hey, next caller 
[03:49:30]  You're on the air  You want to talk to Bobo?  Yeah  You want to talk to yourself, Bobo?  You answered  You answered  Alright, forget it  Who's this?  This is Andrew from Philly  What's up, buddy?  Not much  How come you want to see the Mets?  They're not even good  Yeah, boo  Hang up on that guy  You Phillies suck  We're going to kick your ass  Alright, he's gone  I'm going to kick your ass  I hope the Fnatic gets hit with another ball 
[03:50:00]  Alright, whatever  And this is a whole bunch of them  What are you going to do about this Mets ticket, Bobo?  I'm trying to figure out  If there's anyone from the Mets organization  Who knows if this ticket will work  You can't use a ticket  It's ripped in half  Yeah, the thing is  It's ripped in half  I'm thinking it isn't  Because the barcode part wasn't  You know what's going to happen  When you go to hand that ticket?  Thanks  You know what's going to happen  When you hand that ticket  You answer the guy that scans the ticket  He's going to look at it  And say, you can't use this ticket  It's been ripped in half  And taped back together  And what are you going to say? 
[03:50:30]  Yeah, Patty  What are you going to say?  What can you say?  Oh, good  Your mic's off  The ticket wasn't even used yet  The ticket wasn't even used yet  Yeah, but it's obviously  Just two different tickets  Taped together  Yeah, it's the same ticket  Taped together  If you put it  See there  It's  See there  It's  Like that  See it is  The actual ticket  And if there is  There is anybody  For the Mets organization  Anybody  Anybody  There's got to be someone

What happened is  Bobo  Our friend Bobo  Is a little  Slow  And Bobo  Got tricked  Into ripping up  His very own Mets ticket  Oh, wait  Hang on, sir  We have the hotline ringing  I'm going to have to come back to you  But don't go anywhere, okay?  Because I do want to get back to this  Hang on  Caller, you're on the air 
[03:51:30]  Hello  Yes  Hi, yes  This is Art Vandelay  I work at  Sinkfield  Mr. Vandelay  This sounds like  Some trick  Art Vandelay  That's something  You obviously took out  Of a Seinfeld episode  All right  Oh, shit  Oh, now you just sound  Like a shitty regular caller  With your shit phone  It's obviously  This was a thing  You took that off 
[03:52:00]  Of a Seinfeld episode  Yeah  I didn't  I didn't think  You watched Seinfeld  Yeah, I do  That's the thing  You don't know  That I do, all right  Hey, Ann  How does it feel  To be outsmarted  By a retard?  What episode was it?  That was the one  When George  I think that was  The same one  During  During the  During the whole  Keith Hernandez episode  I think  Ironically  The same episode  Ironically, right  Because he was a Met  Yeah, yeah  But what happened was  He was trying to convince  The unemployed lady 
[03:52:30]  At the unemployment office  That old bit  Right  Yeah, yeah  And he was making up  A fake business  Vandelay Industries  And he was  Hilarious  Wasn't it funny?  Yeah, yeah  Hilarious  Bobo, you're not  Going to the game  That ticket is null  And fucking void  And you're a fucking retard  Oh  Just 10%  Yeah, but  Someone legitimate  Someone legitimate  Me from the Mets organization  That would know this  Call in  A legitimate  Person from the Mets organization  It's like despicable me  It's legitimate me 
[03:53:00]  All right  All right  Have fun  A legitimate person  Yeah, what do you think  Of Opie and Anthony  And how they treated you today?  I ripped his ticket  All right  Microphone  It's a little bit  I'm bummed out  That Opie isn't able  Isn't going to go to the game  Well, you ripped his ticket  You ripped his ticket up  Yeah, but I was trying  To tell him  It probably will still work  I'm sure someone  From the Mets organization  Could confirm  That it would work  All right  All right  Well, hold on  Why didn't you ask Anthony  If he wanted to go?  If he wanted to go 
[03:53:30]  He could have said  He wants to go  But you didn't ask him  You only asked Opie  If he wanted to go  You never ever  Even asked Anthony  So what do you have  A problem with Anthony?  No  I wasn't sure Anthony  Would have wanted to go  Why?  Maybe he wanted to go  To the Mets game  I know Anthony very well  And I'm going to  Fucking tell him  That you didn't want him  To even fucking go  To the Mets  I did want to go  Now that I suspect  You are Anthony  Why would Anthony  Call this show? 
[03:54:00]  I don't know  The voice is starting  To sound familiar  Familiar?  Yeah, very familiar  I freaking know  It's you, Anthony  I could be yelling  At cab drivers  Why am I wasting my time  To this fucking idiot?  Have fun  I don't know why  You try on this show  I know, right?  You're right  You're absolutely right  Bye  Bye  All right  Let's go back  To someone else  I think we had a guy  From the Mets organization  Yeah, line one  Now this is legit, right? 
[03:54:30]  This isn't no fucking around  Because my friend here  Is very upset about his Mets ticket  And I think he's been  Jerked around enough today  No, my name is Mike Mett  I'm the vice president  Of the ticket making  For the Mets organization  All right  What can you do  For Daniel Curlin?  In our tickets  We have a secret code  If he ripped that code  That ticket is no good  I didn't rip  The barcode part  Wasn't ripped up  Did the ticket rip in half?  Where's the secret code located?  It's from the bottom  To the top  I'll just  Take your money  Like the 
[03:55:00]  Like let's call it  Like the middle  Four inches of the ticket  Yes  Yeah, dude  That's totally fucked  That is ripped  It's a fake ticket  They will not accept  We will not accept it  Thanks, Mr. Mett  That ticket there  Was that someone there  With the last name Mett?  He's gone  That's it  Bo, I don't know  What to tell you, man  I mean, look  You did it to yourself  Listen  How come  Hey, we're trying to do  A radio show here  Thanks  So  It's amazing  So, Bobo  What are you going to do? 
[03:55:30]  When's that ticket even for?  It's for next  Was it for this weekend's game?  It was for tomorrow's game  Well, I'll tell you what you do  Kenny ripped your underpants, right?  But he gave you the money for it  So why don't you take the money  Buy a new ticket  I might have to do that  I'll go buy a new ticket  See if it works  What about Opie?  If Opie wants to go  I'll  Then  Then  Then  Definitely  Go  I'll buy the  That's too late  You're not going to see him tomorrow  Yeah, but if 
[03:56:00]  I don't know  Bobo  Bobo, I have a question  Why the fuck is Patty here  On a microphone?  I don't know  Patty's here  Yeah, I'm here  I don't know  I guess she's here  Because she's here  I can't get a word in edgewise, though  Well, let's focus  Let's switch to focus here  Maybe  Maybe Patty's feeling left out  Because she has nothing to do  With Bobo or the Mets  Nah, I'm not a real sports person at all  I'm more of a music person  Well, it's the after show  So this is the show after the show, right?  Right, exactly  So why don't we talk about  What happened on today's show? 
[03:56:30]  What was your favorite part of today's show?  My favorite part was  Letting the guy from Israel  Sit down in the chair of honor  That was your favorite part of the show?  He came a long way  Oh, okay  Yeah  Well  That was awesome  Cool  What was your least favorite part?  How come  How come you wouldn't touch Bobo's dick?  That was my least favorite part  Yeah, but what's the  But what's the difference between  Look, Jim  Jim  Has a cock  Bobo has a cock  But it's not like  It's not like  You're touching Bobo's dick  Because they both have clothes 
[03:57:00]  So you're just touching fabric  So what's the difference?  Uh  Nah  I don't know  What's the problem?  You've touched it before  Like you've touched  You just touched Jim's penis  You know  Through his  Over his pants  You know  What's the difference?  Well, there's a limit that you go to  And you don't go over the limit  Bobo's over the limit  You hear that, Bobo?  Yeah  He's over the limit  Patty pretends like  She don't do nothing  And she's this  Angelic, innocent girl  Meanwhile, I could remember  Back at the old studio 
[03:57:30]  Over at XM  She was wearing  She's wearing  Vibrating panties  And basically coming in her pants  In studio  But then she won't touch  She won't like  Just poke  Or even flick  Ever so slightly  The Bobo cock  No  Don't you think it's time?  Don't you think it's time?  And what better cock to touch  Than a fellow virgin?  That's okay  You know it's never been anywhere  You know he doesn't have anything  Especially a cock  Yeah, it's barely a penis  Like you barely have  You're barely touching a penis  You know he's clean as a whistle 
[03:58:00]  What's the problem?  I don't feel comfortable  But you're comfortable enough  To sit in a room full of men  And basically come in your underwear  Well, you know  I've done crazy, crazy things  Alright, so do one more  And touch his cock  Through the pants  Through the pants  Look, what I'm trying to tell you here  Is that you've done  Crazier things in the past  Yes, I have  So what's the problem?  No one's gonna care  I don't know why you think  This is gonna end up  On like the cover  Of a tabloid somewhere  No one gives a shit  No one gives a shit 
[03:58:30]  Oh, I know  But it's just that, you know  Alright, well  You're obviously a bore  And you're not gonna be doing  Anything else on this radio show  So  Oh, stop  Well, what?  You're gonna do something?  What are you gonna do?  We're running out of time  You're not gonna do nothing  Well, I know this has been  A jam-packed episode  Of the after show  This is, oh my god  I mean, this one  This is one for the books, folks  This is really one for the books  I think this one's gonna go on  The worst of real  Bobo, you wanna  Do you have any final comments?  Well, I've got  Anything to plug? 
[03:59:00]  I think I'm gonna be  At the game tomorrow  I'm gonna be sitting in  Section 526  The Hobie and Anthony show  Is now over </pre>
