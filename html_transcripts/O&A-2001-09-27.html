<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a furious discussion about the aftermath of 9/11, expressing outrage at the perceived lack of decisive government action and public complacency.  Opie and Anthony use harsh language, advocating for aggressive, even nuclear, retaliation against terrorist-harboring nations.  They criticize Jesse Jackson's peace talks in Afghanistan. Listener calls follow, with one caller using the term "appeasement" (which the hosts applaud) and another criticizing their aggressive rhetoric. The hosts also discuss a controversial "WOW" promotional campaign in Boston.

Al Snow, from the WWF, then joins the show. The conversation centers on his experience hosting MTV's *Tough Enough*, including contestant challenges, training demands, and contract selection.  They also discuss *Caddyshack* and play various audio clips, including one from Ted Knight. Snow recounts his career struggles and responds to listener calls about wrestling rumors (involving Hogan, Goldberg, and Bischoff), a notoriously bad match with Owen Hart, and the appropriateness of using current events in wrestling storylines. Opie and Anthony share their own industry struggles and discuss audience oversensitivity.  They play a humorous, poorly recorded Jimmy Snuka show ID and harshly critique a new Michael Jackson music video, with Mario Cantone (who joins later) providing a detailed, colorful description of the video and a Michael Jackson concert he attended. A listener-submitted anti-Osama bin Laden song is played.

The show continues with a discussion of Michael Jackson's relative unimportance following 9/11, contrasting it with the media's focus on Mariah Carey's mental health and the failure of *Glitter*.  Whitney Houston's death is attributed by a host to "bad judgment."  The conversation shifts to pop culture, the Rat Pack, Rankin/Bass specials, and perceived racism in classic Christmas specials. Mario Cantone, now in studio, talks about his upcoming shows at Caroline's, his impressions (including Liza Minnelli), and performing post-9/11.  He shares anecdotes about his life and celebrity interactions.  A prank call montage featuring Kid Chris calling O.J. Simpson is played. The hosts discuss 9/11's impact on their show and the city, the role of comedy as a distraction, Lonnie O'Grady's death (*8 is Enough*), and their family histories.  Humorous bits about Cantone's attire, Angelina Jolie's charity work, and Mike Tyson's legal issues ensue.  More calls, further impressions (especially Anthony's Mike Tyson impression), and a discussion of Australian penis puppeteers conclude this segment.

The broadcast then rambles into a discussion of Oscar De La Hoya's music, followed by a call from Stacey boasting about handling Mike Tyson, leading to a discussion of bringing naked women back to the show, and a patriotic contest to achieve this goal. Listener calls follow, including one defending Angelina Jolieâ€™s Afghan donation, sparking a debate about prioritizing American needs over foreign aid (mentioning Jane Fonda). Another listener counters this, highlighting the plight of attack victims. Mario Cantone recounts a story about improvising lines in *Quiz Show*.  The hosts and Cantone engage in a humorous hypothetical about a date between Joan Crawford and Mike Tyson, leading to comedic skits and impersonations. Further calls discuss Angelina Jolie's actions, with one caller suggesting chaining criminals for Ground Zero cleanup.  More calls follow: one promoting wild stickers and suggesting Angelina Jolie be strapped to a bomb, another discussing corruption in foreign aid. The show ends with promotions for Mario Cantone's appearances, a WWF event, a Jane's Addiction ticket giveaway, and the Trinidad vs. Hopkins boxing match.  Multiple audio clips and discussions of the poorly-received Michael Jackson music video are interspersed throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Are you bastards ready to rock?  Opie and Anthony.  And you'll actually find them rubbing the feces on the wall.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Psychotic apes.  Is this for Sean Factor?  Oh my god!  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, I'm playing. 
[00:00:30]  What's up, man?  Oh!  Couple phone numbers.  New York.  New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else.  Including Cleveland, Sacramento, Dallas, Chicago, Washington, Boston, Philadelphia.  Woo!  Columbus.  Like the AIDS we are.  Buffalo.  Like the AIDS.  I said Rochester, right?  Yes.  Seattle, right?  I don't think you said Seattle.  San Francisco.  Portland. 
[00:01:00]  Right.  Probably missed somebody in there.  I apologize.  866-2774.  Wow.  And stay tuned.  Some new ones popping up soon that we can all have fun going.  V-Boy Las Vegas.  V-Boy Las Vegas.  V-Boy Las Vegas.  Ah, yes.  Vegas.  Yep.  I'm hearing things.  Hearing things.  Home of the, uh, mothers of all casinos. 
[00:01:30]  V-Boy Las Vegas.  High class hookers.  I can't wait.  I can't wait.  I can't wait because there's been a, there's a morning show in Vegas.  Yeah.  That just completely took wow and made it their own.  Yeah, they were, um, I gotta give them this though.  I think they were one of the first few shows to steal wow.  So if you give them that for originality, maybe they're, maybe they're doing all right.  And I want to applaud the faithful listeners, the ONA Army. 
[00:02:00]  They've been pounding these guys for well over a year saying, hey man, who are you kidding?  And now.  Just wait.  We'll be on in Vegas to, to, to tell everyone where they got their cute little idea from.  That'll be fun.  Anyway, if you're in another city and you want in on the show today, 866-277-4WOW.  All right?  Lots, lots, lots to do today.  Boy, did you see the bombs dropping and stuff and the war?  It was, oh, no, that's right.  Neither did I. 
[00:02:30]  You know, I, I've, I've given up, uh, turning, turning on the TV in the morning.  Have you?  Just because I know it's going to be the same old thing.  Yeah, didn't you like run to the TV in the morning and turn it on and just expect to  see that infrared shot of tracer rounds and let me take you through it real fast, okay?  Disaster, 1.9 miles to, to our right here, right?  Right.  1.2 miles.  1.9.  1.9?  I'm keeping with the formula.  Okay, 1.9.  1.9 miles to my right.  Are we moving or is the location moving? 
[00:03:00]  Because I want to know if the location's going to be north of us soon or are we going to  be somewhere in the river?  I'm following the formula that we came up with yesterday.  Okay.  All I know is I was wrong when I said it was three miles and I was wrong when I said it  was two miles to our right.  It is 1.9 miles to my right.  There you go.  1.9 miles away.  Just following the formula.  Okay.  So all hell breaks loose and trust me, we have not forgotten.  What Ant and I are trying to do is what we call a little distraction, trying to give 
[00:03:30]  you a few chuckles.  There you go.  Because it's still as painful as it was September 11th.  Trust me.  You see it everywhere you go in Manhattan.  I'll tell you one thing.  I'll be completely honest with you.  It is indeed as painful for those that lost people and for the city itself.  But I'm starting to sense people aren't forgetting, but they're getting used to it.  They're sucking it up and moving on. 
[00:04:00]  And if that goes on too long, we're screwed because then we won't do anything.  And it'll, you know, maybe another eight years will go by or something.  But then, move.  You make a good point.  So let me walk you through it.  So September 11th happens, right?  What did everyone do right off the bat?  They were watching.  Freaked out, lost their minds.  When they weren't listening to our lovely radio show.  Yes.  Everyone was watching TV around the clock.  You were watching so much TV that you felt like, you know what?  I have to keep the TV on even when I'm sleeping, just in case. 
[00:04:30]  Just in case.  Because we are going to bomb any second.  Oh, silly us thinking that.  So then a few days go by and you're like, okay, well, all right.  Well, I guess I could turn the TV off when I try to get, you know, maybe six hours sleep.  Because no one's sleeping in the tri-state area.  You're sleeping with half an eye open, at best.  So then you would run downstairs or wherever your TV is as soon as you woke up and turn  it on to see if anything was happening.  So you did that for about a week to ten days.  Now we're at the stage where I'm not even running to turn on the TV in the morning. 
[00:05:00]  Because I just know nothing is happening.  And if you've noticed, your news stations, maybe your local radio news stations.  Oh, slowly but surely.  Slowly, slowly getting the goofy stories in.  Right.  They're going back to regular news.  They're starting to kind of, they're starting to talk about Gary Condit a little bit.  They're starting to talk about that bitch of a mom that drowned her kids in Texas.  Yeah.  And Hollywood news.  Starting to talk about how we shouldn't execute retards.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's another issue.  But slowly, things just, you know, we get back to our normal lives. 
[00:05:30]  The upside is, hey, we got back to our normal lives.  The downside, this hasn't been resolved yet.  And this war on terrorism isn't a war.  Don't call it a war.  It's some kind of a, it's some kind of a red tape ridden, politically correct, fake war.  I think at this point it's called an inconvenience. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Something akin to an inconvenience.  Sure.  It's nothing, it's, we're not doing anything.  And it's frustrating.  It really is.  Because we'll just settle back down.  Before you know it, you know, seven, eight years is a long time.  You know, we had 93, the World Trade Center bombing.  And then, you know, eight years go by.  Seven, eight years go by.  And then everyone forgot.  You know, the security goes back to the way it was. 
[00:06:30]  Everyone just goes about their business.  You remember it as being a horrible thing that happened a while ago.  Well, and then it happens again.  Because we didn't do anything.  And let's make no mistake about it.  Next time is going to be ten times as worse.  Oh, that's hard to imagine right now.  For sure.  But the next time, it will be biological weapons.  It will be maybe a nuclear bomb.  Whatever.  Anthra.  All that crap.  How horrible was it?  Because these things have to keep escalating, okay?  Right.  Because now if they, you know, this is how we think as human beings. 
[00:07:00]  And I'm going to be very careful how I say this.  But if they, like, knock down a building on the Upper East Side here in Manhattan and it was only 40 stories, we already saw two huge ones.  Right.  We're barely going to blink.  You are so right.  We're barely going to blink.  We're going to be, oh, that sucks.  But, hey, man, it didn't compare to this mess on September 11th.  And the terrorists know that.  And the next time, it's going to be even uglier.  Do you remember the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center and how awful it looked with the smoke and the people coming out with the rags on their face? 
[00:07:30]  And you're like, oh, my God, they struck us at home.  This is horrible.  It was probably the worst international act of terrorism that you could imagine.  And it freaked everyone out in Manhattan.  Freaked everyone out.  Just like we're thinking now.  Everyone was completely freaked.  And thank God not many people died.  Yeah.  And it's kind of sad that you have to say, thank God not many people died.  Yeah.  But that was the case back then.  And then you might have had some conversations with people going, you know, it could be worse. 
[00:08:00]  It could be worse.  What would happen if, and if you just off the top of your head said something like they flew planes into the World Trade Center and they fell down, you'd be like, ah, stop it.  Now, I can understand the Ryder truck full of explosives in there, but the tower didn't come down.  It was horrible and all, but you couldn't possibly conceive that could happen, right?  Right.  Well, it happened.  So now every other horrific vision you have for terrorism is up for grabs.  Anything can happen. 
[00:08:30]  Anything.  It doesn't matter now.  Right.  So we have to act now.  If you want to sit there and be happy for maybe another five, seven years, something like that, fine.  We do nothing.  We might even get five, seven years out of it of sitting there with nothing really happening.  Maybe.  Could happen.  But mark my words, we don't do something huge.  They will be back worse than what we just saw.  You don't think it's possible?  Oh, yeah.  We didn't think the Twin Tower thing was possible.  You think 7,000 people dead is rough? 
[00:09:00]  Hell, yeah, it is.  How about tenfold?  How about 70?  How about 700?  How about millions?  How would you like to then sit there and go, why did millions of Americans die from disease or whatever the hell they spring on us next?  Because we sat back and really fell into this complacency.  Well, unless we do something huge, it's going to happen again.  You know, if I was the president, I would go on TV right now and I would talk to the terrorists and these countries that harbor the terrorists, and I would say this. 
[00:09:30]  One more terrorist attack on American soil, we nuke your country.  That's good.  No, ands, ifs, or buts.  That's good.  And just say, hey, you want to play?  We'll play.  What the hell is this?  One more terrorist attack, and we could prove that it came from Afghanistan where you guys were harboring the terrorists.  We completely nuke your country.  Right.  No political correctness.  No worrying about what country we're offending or turning off as an ally. 
[00:10:00]  We're past that.  They talk about this new war.  The old war depended on things like allies and whatnot.  You want to see a new war?  This is about the United States of America and a couple of our very closest allies.  We can't go out trying to bargain with Saudi Arabia when we're talking about eliminating people that they're very close to in a lot of ways.  It ain't going to work. 
[00:10:30]  What we've got to do is suck it up, take the inconveniences and sacrifices that will be made because of this, and you know something?  I'm one of the worst people when it comes to that.  But if it's for action and I see something coming out of it, I'm fine with it, and everyone else should be.  Well, Anthony, some good news came about today, though.  Jesse Jackson will be representing the United States.  When did anyone vote for Jesse Jackson?  Why does this son of a bitch feel that he's got to traipse off to whatever country we're having a problem with or whatever people we're having a problem with and talk peace and bring people back and do things? 
[00:11:00]  I'm an American citizen.  I don't want Jesse Jackson going over there because this isn't open for discussion.  These are people that you don't talk with.  We're beyond that.  I'm tired of hearing the people that are up in arms saying, you know, haven't we seen enough violence?  There's got to be peaceful means of solving this. 
[00:11:30]  There isn't.  We weren't doing anything when they did this to us.  We were not doing anything.  And we have seen enough violence, and that's why we've got to take care of it now so this doesn't happen again.  We'll see more.  You know why?  It has come down to this.  They die or we die.  Pick one.  At this point, I'm convinced there will be another terrorist attack on American soil before we do anything.  I'm convinced of that.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm convinced.  Every day I'm on the edge of my seat on the train as I come into Manhattan going, okay, where is it going to happen? 
[00:12:00]  Is it going to be this train?  Is it going to be this tunnel?  Is it going to be this bridge?  Where is it going to happen?  Yeah.  I mean, you know, I give major props to the NYPD and the FBI and all those people out there making sure that nothing does happen in this city because I know they're working their balls off.  Yeah.  You can tell they're just freaked out when you pass these checkpoints.  Yeah, well, they got their work cut out for them.  They're checking every...  It's an almost impossible task.  They're checking every truck that comes in and out of Manhattan.  And I was talking to Sandy because they were showing some of the checkpoints. 
[00:12:30]  You can't check the whole truck.  No.  They're opening up the back and it's just packed with boxes.  Yeah.  So what are they going to, empty out the whole load on the street?  Well, you can only hope...  They're doing the best they can, but there's no guarantee.  This isn't...  These spot checks aren't to find people with things.  They are to stop people from trying to do something.  I understand, to deter it all that.  It's not to find...  You know, they're not going to pull a truck over and find one of those fertilizer bombs in there or something. 
[00:13:00]  It's to make the people that would want to do something like that think, hey, you know, they're really checking a lot of this stuff.  All right.  Well, how long can they do this, though?  They cannot do this forever.  No.  That's why I'm saying in a few years...  If they do it five years, it would be so long.  We would not do it for five years.  And knowing the tolerance of the average New Yorker...  Yeah.  ...and the tolerance of the average American, it's going to last tops a couple months. 
[00:13:30]  Tops.  I think until they clean up lower Manhattan and it's open to the public again.  And then we're back to business as usual.  Unless we do something quickly, internationally, we're so screwed.  You people...  I hear it all the time that we have to talk.  We have to diplomatically solve this.  Enough with the war.  You don't...  There's no talking to them.  They hate America.  Like, part of their twisted version of their religion, these extremists, is to hate Americans. 
[00:14:00]  That's what they do.  Like, you pray to God on your churches, in your churches, synagogues, and whatever.  They hate Americans.  It's part of their religion.  The fanatical versions of these religions, I'm saying.  Not all of them.  They hate us.  They don't want our land.  They don't want...  It doesn't matter.  People don't understand that.  They want us gone.  They don't want our land.  You can't talk to someone that wants you eliminated from the earth, that feels you are against their God. 
[00:14:30]  You can't reason with them.  It's not like you sit down and talk at a peace table with a country about land, or about troops being stationed somewhere, about missiles being somewhere, deployed somewhere.  It's a group of people that want you dead.  And there's the only thing they want is you dead.  How do you talk to them?  There's no talking.  It's they die or we die. 
[00:15:00]  That's the only choices that are left here.  It's not like a diplomatic solution is open.  It's not like we can't kill them.  My God, there's been enough killing.  Because if we don't, then more of us die.  You want that?  I don't.  Tony, what's going on?  What's up, Owen A?  Hey, boy.  I haven't called in a while.  Dude, what?  Hey, all right, I got nothing against Jesse Jackson, but what the hell is he going to do over there?  Give him a lesson in morality?  Yeah.  You know, how to not get your mistress pregnant, how to not pay child support. 
[00:15:30]  You know, how are these people going to take him seriously?  You know what I mean?  You know what I gave him and he said?  Never mind dropping rocks.  Turn that place into a goddamn parking lot.  Hey, he's got something in common with the Afghanistans.  They both don't know how to treat their women, so.  Yeah.  Wait a minute, guys.  Have a good one.  Here's Ray checking in on instant feedback.  Since you want blood, whose blood do we spill?  Just kill some Arabs to get even?  Yeah, that's what I'm saying, you effing tool.  I think we're a little more educated than that, Ray.  That is what the terrorists want, and you idiots are pandering to them. 
[00:16:00]  The terrorists want all-out war.  Stick to the boob jokes and leave politics and military action to politicians and generals.  There could be all kinds of stuff happening, and you don't know about it.  Special ops are in.  Well, yeah.  You know, Ray, that special ops are in.  Shut up.  There are reports that the British SAS have been having firefights with Taliban militia.  And now what?  Oh, and Ray knows about this.  And now one person has leaked this to the media.  I guess you're forgetting.  You idiot.  I guess you're forgetting that the U.S. needs oil to make our SUVs and planes go. 
[00:16:30]  Starting a war with Arabs would be bad for everyone.  With all Arabs.  Did we say, first of all, start a war with all Arabs, Ray, you dick?  No.  Did we say, just kill some Arabs and get it even?  Are you listening to this show, you friggin' idiot?  We said a few days ago that most likely it's going to be Americans, Jews, Catholics.  I shouldn't have said Americans.  Jews, Catholics, and Muslims, and the Arab community fighting alongside us.  A smorgasbord. 
[00:17:00]  You idiot jerk-off.  If you listened, I'll say it one more time for you because you're friggin' retarded.  What I said is, there are countries out there, not all Arab countries, dick, that are backing terrorists.  We've known about this for years.  Their government doesn't care.  We've done nothing about it.  Now is the time to punish these countries, the governments that run them, and kill them for sponsoring these terrorists. 
[00:17:30]  Not all of the Arab countries, dickbag.  We got oil.  We got oil in Kuwait.  We bailed them out.  There you go.  There's our oil.  Are we going to bomb Kuwait?  There are Arabs over there.  Huh?  Did I say that, Ray, you ass?  Jesus Christ!  Do you listen?  Why is Earl in the studio?  Earl, how's your brother Jesse doing? 
[00:18:00]  I'm good.  Why in God's name would Jesse Jackson go over and speak with the Taliban,  who you could pop up videos on websites showing them cutting the throats of their opponents in stadiums.  They have stadiums there.  They fill them with people.  This isn't this urban legend stuff that goes around.  We've seen videos of this, where they go in the middle of the arena,  they line people up, either shoot them in the head, 
[00:18:30]  or my favorite, they pin people down,  where three people hold the legs, the arms down, and another holds the head,  and like he's cutting a roast, cuts the guy right to the spine,  cuts through his neck right to the spine,  as he's writhing around trying to get away for the, you know, two seconds he has energy.  That's the type of government that he now feels he could go over and reason with.  They also beat their women in the streets openly.  Oh, yeah.  They had some footage of that on Larry King last night. 
[00:19:00]  Well, she's a whore.  She's showing her ankle or something.  Yeah.  Just beat the living crap out of the women right on the streets.  Ray, you dick.  Sorry.  Get that in again.  Earl, that's all you wanted to say?  No, I mean, I was just reading, getting facts on all of it,  and just about everyone that supports him is telling him, don't do this.  Everyone is saying, don't do this.  And he said he was invited by the government.  Well, good.  I hope he stays over there.  What if they hold him hostage, and now he's got to deal with a hostage Jesse? 
[00:19:30]  I don't think he's going to go.  Imagine that.  I mean, the Bush administration has said they will not support it,  and they might go as far as revoke his passport.  All right.  So he wouldn't be able to go.  Thank you.  All right, this is Reverend Jesse Jackson, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Shut up.  That's real.  I know.  Who got that for us?  YSP.  YSP.  He got it.  YSP.  Yeah, right on.  We don't have the version where he says YSP.  I mean, everyone knows where we got it from. 
[00:20:00]  And I just want to see him say, YSP.  Y'all listening to YSP.  Stay out the bushes.  Hi, and this is Reverend Jesse Jackson, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony on 94-WYSP.  Get out of here.  Dick.  Dick.  Anyway, we got a couple of goof songs.  Because we are here to try to make you chuckle a little bit.  There you go.  I'm stepping off of my soapbox. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, that's today's rant.  Yeah.  I think it's very healthy to have one a day, right?  Of course.  Yes.  Oh, you know, I apologize.  Oh, wait.  We do know who did this one.  Where's the other one?  Dale?  Yeah.  Do we know who did the Dale one?  Yeah, I apologize.  Someone sent this in, and it's worth spinning once or twice.  Yeah.  Check this out.  Hey, yo. 
[00:21:00]  Hey, yo.  Air Force, come and they flatten your home.  Run, Mr. Taliban.  We know where you're hiding.  Air Force, come and they flatten your home.  Hey, USA, USA, USA.  Oh, Uncle Sam, come and they flatten your home.  60-foot, 70-foot, 80-foot crater.  Air Force, come and they flatten your home. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, Uncle Sam's pissed.  He ain't no Quaker.  Air Force, come and they flatten your home.  When we finish, you all be crying.  Air Force, come and they flatten your home.  Pilot, his brother of New York firemen.  Air Force, come and they flatten your home.  There you go.  Who sent that in?  Big John?  Thank you, Big John, for helping out the show today. 
[00:22:00]  All right.  And why don't we take our first break, okay?  All right.  Listen, man, everyone's calling like crazy.  Just stay on hold.  We'll go to the phones next, okay?  Right around the corner, too, Al Snow from the WWF is coming in.  I guess the last episode of Tough Enough is on MTV tonight, I believe.  And he's going to talk about that and other things.  Stay out the bushes.  We love Al Snow.  He's a lot of fun.  Yeah.  Also, one of our faves is coming in today, Mario Cantone.  Mario, cool.  Stay there.  Ready?  Three, two, one. 
[00:22:30]  Opie and Anthony.  The Robert Downey Jr. is a radio.  Right.  Where you can't leave anything alone.  Let's hear a mother-daughter queef over the phone.  You pick artistic subjects.  Opie and Anthony.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  A little taste of God smacked.  Black magic from their latest CD.  Yeah.  CNN's doing a little thing right now.  What will it take for you to fly again?  How about a parachute and an escape hatch? 
[00:23:00]  Well, George Bush got on TV and started saying, hey, we got to fly.  Got to fly.  Got to get the people back on the airplanes.  But, you know, it was just recently signed.  Two Air Force generals now have carte blanche without ever talking to the president to shoot down any passenger aircraft that they deem a threat. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  How about that?  Don't even have to talk to the president anymore.  They kind of gave him free reign.  So if, uh, let's say a transponder fails, no one knows where the plane's going, and then it goes off course, uh-oh, shoot her down.  You know, I'm supposed to fly soon.  Yeah.  I have a commitment, and I think I'm going to have to call and say I'm not coming. 
[00:24:00]  Can you drive?  It's a long drive.  Yeah.  I am freaked out.  I still say fly.  If I had somewhere to go, I'd fly.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, it's a four-day weekend.  I'll fly.  I'll go somewhere.  What the hell?  Let's go to the phone and see what's going on.  Brother Hemp from San Francisco.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  What's up?  Hey, I agree with you, man.  We got to do something because history has shown appeasement just doesn't work.  Mm-mm.  And nothing.  Anthony, during your daily rant yesterday, you said something about... 
[00:24:30]  Brother Hemp?  Yeah.  I want to congratulate you.  For what?  You're the first person to ever use appeasement on our radio show.  Very nice.  Well, I watched the History Channel last night.  We've said appeasiotomy before.  We've said appeasiotomy.  That's about as close as we've gotten.  Oh, Ben, is there anything we could send the fine brother from San Francisco for using  the word appeasement on our show?  Yes.  Very nice.  Look at us.  I'm making believe we're intelligent.  All right.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  What's up?  No problem.  Anthony, yesterday, your daily rant, you're talking about the U.S. responded December 18, 
[00:25:00]  1941.  What were you talking about?  Yeah.  No, that was like a month later when we bombed the marshals.  I was pissed.  I was pissed.  So you weren't referring to the Doolittle Raid then?  No, that was April 18.  All right.  Just checking because I was looking up on my history books on the net and I couldn't find  anything.  Yeah, Doolittle April 18.  That was a nice one.  Yeah, it was.  I'm bombing Japan.  Those bastards.  Yeah, I agree.  Now, there's a ballsy set of guys.  Let me just briefly let you know about this, people.  Jimmy Doolittle, back in World War II, he had 16 planes. 
[00:25:30]  They sent on a bombing run to Japan.  Here's balls.  They weren't, we didn't have a lot of air bases near Japan, so they had enough fuel to get  there.  How the hell about that?  They knew they had not enough fuel to get home, but they had 16 planes full of guys that  decided they were going to go on this anyway and bomb the crap out of Japan for what they  did to us at Pearl Harbor and ditch the planes.  They ditched the planes.  A lot of them were killed.  A lot of them taken prisoner. 
[00:26:00]  And some of them actually made it far enough away to ditch the plane and get back home.  But that right there is America.  Amen, brother.  Is that cowardly?  Yeah, right?  Bill Maher?  God, I can't wait to read in the paper that he is out of a job.  I know.  He's such a dick.  Oh, how happy are you going to be, Anthony?  He's such a dick.  Hey, brother, hold on the line.  We're going to try to find you something, all right?  Thanks a lot, man.  Thanks for listening in San Francisco.  All right.  Let's go to Jerome.  Hey, Jerome, what's up? 
[00:26:30]  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I just want to know if you had any idea about those big-ass wow signs that were in Boston  the other day or yesterday.  All right.  I've got to bring this up because you guys have gone crazy for these bus signs.  Anthony, you want to explain the wow thing?  The wow campaign was hitting Boston once again.  Yeah.  We started wow up in Boston.  We're back on the radio in Boston.  So, huge ad campaign.  We were going to have Opie and Anthony, wow, and then WBC on the station we're on in Boston,  all over the place, on the sides of buses, at the T-stops, all that fine stuff, on billboards. 
[00:27:00]  And the MBTA up there just wimped out because two people complained.  Two people complained.  And Dean Johnson, reporter out there, had a rat on us.  Dean Johnson from the Boston Herald invented his own story to get us in trouble.  Made his own story and ratted us out.  Wait, wait, quick, quick, quick.  I've got a quick thing to say.  I'm scared of Anthony.  Why?  Just because of his whole spiel today. 
[00:27:30]  That is great.  Hey, that's how I feel.  Screw you.  How weird are you?  Usually they say they're scared of me.  Yeah, I know.  That kind of got me crazy.  Yeah, you're losing your effing mind, Anthony.  I know.  So, a lot of these bus signs were up for, I think, two days.  Yep.  And the MBTA, they cracked under the pressure of two people complaining.  Two people.  And a stupid story from Dean Johnson, who has a dead animal on his head, who made up this stupid story.  A-pooza!  That's right.  A-pooza! 
[00:28:00]  So, they had to get rid of these bus signs.  Yeah.  Turns out, I didn't know this, that these bus signs are huge wow stickers.  Huge wow stickers.  I thought they were like cardboard.  No.  They're stickers.  They stick them on the sides and on the backs of the buses.  So, as a goof yesterday, we're like, well, let's hand these out all over Boston.  And we didn't really advertise.  And so, BCN, they sent a van north and they sent a van west of the city, down Route 9 there in the Framingham area.  They gave away tons of them and hundreds of people showed up. 
[00:28:30]  See?  On a whim.  There you go.  So, they're going to do that again next Wednesday.  But this is the weird thing.  Yeah.  People are emailing us from all over the country.  They all want one of these huge wow, which it's just a huge wow sticker is what it comes out to be.  It's giant.  It's giant.  Just imagine, I mean, we've all seen the sides of buses with the advertisements.  Yeah.  That's how big these things are.  People are eating them up in Boston.  And other people around the country are starting to call, excuse me, WBCN, trying to figure out how they can get one as well. 
[00:29:00]  Well, we might have to make some of those up ourselves.  Yeah, the stop was too high.  It was too high north for me to get to.  I was talking to the gang in Boston before the show today.  And they said, like, truck drivers were stopping by, grabbing these huge wow stickers and just slapping it on the back of their rigs.  That's great.  That is great.  I imagine those things will be slapped all over Boston.  Hey, I want to complain about wow, I'm offended by it.  Take it off your buses. 
[00:29:30]  They do good, Dave.  By the way, a question.  If you go up on a billboard but no one notices, were you really up on that billboard?  Ah!  How pathetic.  Hey.  How pathetic.  You go on a billboard for 10 days to try to raise $107,000.  Howard goes on the air for two hours and raises a million and a half.  You loser.  Ouch.  He did one of your bits the other day.  He started playing the songs.  Kind of got annoying.  Who, Howard?  Yeah.  Yeah, but he doesn't rip anyone off. 
[00:30:00]  So let's just be careful about that.  No, I didn't say that.  I just said that he did the whole, like, the song thing.  Yeah, we got a few more we're going to do today.  But, Jerome, to answer your question.  Right.  We're going to do it again this coming Wednesday in Boston, and we're going to advertise it a little better.  So I imagine there's going to be a lot of people showing up to hear those things.  No problem.  So just keep listening to the show, all right?  No problem.  Thank you very much.  All right, man.  Have a good day.  Bye.  Bye.  See, the thing is, you hear a listener like that calls up and says, oh, yeah, Howard was playing the tribute songs and goofing on them. 
[00:30:30]  But we're not going to sit here and go, oh, man, we were doing that.  Because it's just something you would do if you're on the radio.  You get these songs.  Everyone gets them.  It's not like you're recording it off another show.  These things are being handed out like the AIDS.  They're everywhere.  And you play them and goof on them.  So to sit there and go, oh, that's a ripoff is silly.  Of course he was going to goof on it.  And, of course, we were going to goof on it.  Yeah.  Let's go to Psycho Tim.  He's pretty much the general of the O&A Army in Boston.  Psycho Tim. 
[00:31:00]  How's it going, gentlemen?  Amen.  Just to correct you, they are handing out the cardboard signs from the back of the buses.  But because BCN, such a great effing radio station, that Kid Cowan promotion, had stickers made bigger for us to stick on stuff.  Like, they're really big stickers, though, right?  They're huge.  They're probably twice to three times the size of the cardboard things that go on the back of the buses.  Because BCN is the baldiest radio station in Boston. 
[00:31:30]  That's why they do that.  That's Cali and Oedipus and Chacho guys.  They made bigger stickers for us.  This isn't even fair anymore.  We were just completely destroying our old station.  I was hoping we were going to get some kind of a fight because we love fighting.  Yeah.  No, no.  Dave has instructed them over there.  Dave Dickless has instructed them not to...  Talk.  Not to tangle with us.  Don't talk about us.  Just ignore them and they'll go away.  Just ignore them and let them walk all over us. 
[00:32:00]  Don't worry, but I have a plan.  Dave's strategy.  Remember when he used to...  From my days in Nebraska.  Don't worry, guys.  Let them walk all over you.  But I will have a plan in the end.  Trust me.  Remember when he used to tell us to do the same thing?  Yeah.  And we were like, screw you.  We were the only ones that didn't listen.  We didn't listen and we fought back and we kicked ass up there.  And now he's telling his boys to shut up and what are they doing?  You're shutting up, aren't you?  No, they're hiring police officers is what they're doing.  There you go.  Yeah, to protect their talent. 
[00:32:30]  Ooh, we're so...  You got to protect me.  You know, they have a guy jumping out of the woods to tackle me.  You know, that's good.  It's radio.  You know, I don't need to be arrested for it.  You know?  If you want to be seen on a billboard, be on a billboard that's seen.  Like, he's on a billboard.  I swear to God.  People send us pictures.  He's on a billboard in the woods.  In the middle of the woods.  In the woods.  In the woods, is it?  It's in the woods.  And now you're hiring cops and stuff.  That's paranoia.  Yeah, we had a sticker giveaway yesterday a couple places. 
[00:33:00]  I mean, not we.  BCN had a sticker.  I was there.  You know, there was no cops there.  You know, Tim, you're pretty much an employee of BCN at this point, so...  Great.  Wonderful.  You can say we.  Okay.  Well, I was just saying that, you know, we didn't have to have cops to show up, because  none of those pussy listeners from AF would ever, ever show up.  Because we'd be on our private property, but we'd have the rights.  Right.  Hey!  So, that's the main problem those guys have.  All right, Tim.  General Tim.  All right, guys.  General Tim from the O&A Army of Boston. 
[00:33:30]  Check it in.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Bye.  Is it true that the cops almost shot Rocco in the woods, because they thought he was  a bear?  Pluto.  Coming in from the dump.  Hey, guys.  Hey!  Sounds like Dave...  Sounds like Dave Dickens has the same plan as George Bush.  Put him, walk all over us, and maybe they'll go away.  There it is.  I want to kill someone.  You know something?  This is a perfect example.  You're absolutely right.  Look what happens when they just sit there and don't fight back.  I mean, I'm going to bars picking fights, because I'm so pumped up.  Hey, I'm on a billboard in the woods. 
[00:34:00]  All right, take care.  You guys are done.  All right.  I'm in the woods.  Hopefully, the bunny rabbit will donate some money.  Hey, what's going on?  Dave, what should we do?  What a soul.  Hey, where's Al Snow?  He's not...  Is he here?  Almost.  Almost here?  Meaning he's upstairs on his way down?  Yep.  Oh, good.  Larry, what's going on, bro? 
[00:34:30]  Hey, what's up?  You're on the radio, Larry.  I guess I just wanted to touch base with you.  I don't think that your daily rant is a rant at all.  I think it's just keeping him honest.  It was someone...  I mean, somebody's got to keep saying this over and over, or else the idea of us retaliating  and proving that this can't happen will just fade away.  And you're absolutely right about putting the world on notice.  The next time it happens, there's going to be an immediate reaction. 
[00:35:00]  We should have dropped...  Wait, wait, wait.  No, Larry.  Immediate reaction.  I said, simple as this.  Another terrorist attack on American soil.  We announced this.  We go on TV and say, we will nuke your country.  No questions asked.  There you go.  I guess I'd modify that and say, let's drop a couple of neutron bombs instead of nuking  them, because then we don't have to worry about the fallout.  And we can have a whole set of targets previously identified, like these training bases in Afghanistan,  and just vaporize them.  And there's no fallout, and it turns into glass, and everyone knows ahead of time, if 
[00:35:30]  you screw with us, you're going to get paid.  The neutron bomb.  Remember that one?  It kills the people but leaves the building standing.  Why would you use that in Afghanistan?  Because they already look like they've been bombed out.  It'll flatten the stuff, I guarantee you.  The thing I wanted to call you about was, you were talking earlier about the lack of  action that the feds are doing right now.  You know, down here in D.C., they've got an eight-lane highway, blocked off still, because 
[00:36:00]  it's a quarter mile from the Pentagon.  There's absolutely no wreckage by it.  It's very convenient now for, I guess, the law enforcement people to drive back and forth  to Washington, but of the two major bridges that go from Virginia into D.C., one of them's  effectively blocked off to rush hour traffic, because they've decided that they want to  keep this highway blocked off.  And it's just insane.  It's like...  Well, is there...  Maybe there's a reason.  Maybe they need the highway to get some of the debris out?  There's no debris at all. 
[00:36:30]  Because that's what...  Literally, a quarter mile from the Pentagon, if they're worried about people seeing what  they're doing, all they have to do is put up visual barriers.  Oh, maybe that's it.  Yeah, well...  You know, it's...  Larry, you can't blame them.  I mean, everyone is extra cautious at this point, you know?  Yeah, but I do blame them for not restoring normalcy.  Everyone wants normalcy.  But now they're saying, well, you all have to tolerate this rush hour traffic.  Right.  And it's like to prove that they're doing something when, in fact, they aren't doing 
[00:37:00]  a damn thing.  They're just afraid to open the road up because they might have to close it again sometime  in the future.  And it's like, please, just put up the damn barricades and let people drive to and from  work.  Open up the airport.  You know, the Washington National Airport has been closed since the 11th.  Yeah, well, they think it's a little too close to the Pentagon.  Yeah, but when you're flying an airplane, we're talking the difference between 10 seconds  and 50 seconds.  Well, that's a big difference. 
[00:37:30]  Again, we're doing a lot of stuff.  40 seconds.  We're doing a lot of stuff.  It gets in the good guy's way, but we aren't doing jack against the bad guy.  Well, I am totally willing to just sit back and see what all this is about, the traffic  jams, the roadblocks, everything else, security checks.  If we're going to do something, then I'm fine with the inconvenience.  If we're just going to sit back and fade back into what we were doing for eight years, then 
[00:38:00]  there's a problem.  But there has to be a reason for it.  We have to be countering something.  Exactly.  So hopefully that's happening.  Larry, thanks, man.  Keep them on us, guys.  All right.  Thanks, Larry.  Sorry about that, Al Snow.  Oh, that's quite a relief.  We got Larry on the phone there.  He got a little long window.  A lot of people have a lot to say these days.  Very intense individual.  Yeah.  How you been, man?  I'm doing, you know, as good as can be.  Yeah.  We're going to take a break.  We're going to talk to Al Snow next.  Cool.  We're taking a break now?  Yeah, Larry took up all your time.  Larry has got me on the edge, man. 
[00:38:30]  I am riled up, damn it.  Huge fan of Tough Enough, and we're going to talk about that now.  Yes, we are.  And I was able to catch up because MTV did one of those Tough Enough marathons.  You just can't get enough snow, can you?  I love Al Snow doing a great job with the show.  Always at least 12 inches when I arrive.  And if you want to talk to Al Snow, give us a call, okay?  We'll be back.  Someone, let me get this instant feedback.  Give me the Ted Knight thing.  I can't even find it now.  Ted Knight?  Yeah, somebody.  We played this dueling Ted Knight thing yesterday, and someone wants to hear it again. 
[00:39:00]  Are we back on Caddyshack again?  Aren't we always?  Doesn't it seem like that?  Caddyshack, always funny.  Someone requested.  Oh, here it is.  Please replay Dueling Ted Knight.  That's Fish Guard Boy.  I have a personal request.  Oh, yeah.  Could I please hear Jimmy Snuka?  Jimmy Snuka?  Please.  We'll do that next.  All right, when we come back.  I Ted Knighted it.  We're the naked cowboy. 
[00:39:30]  Spalding, I want you with a golf course in five minutes.  Chop, chop.  Come on.  Come on in.  We've got to go back and forth.  Did you hear the one about the colored boy?  No.  Go ahead.  No, I heard that one.  That's a hoot.  Wait a second.  You be Ted Knight.  Wait.  Wait.  I almost said the wrong word.  You screwed up.  I screwed up.  Who screwed up?  I did.  Okay.  You be Ted Baxter.  I'll be the guy from Too Close for Comfort.  It's easy to grin when your ship comes in and you've got the stock market beat, but the 
[00:40:00]  man that's worthwhile is the man that could smile when his shorts are too tight in the  seat.  Okay.  Okay, Pookie, Chris, and the boat.  Wait a second.  I think Monroe wants to see the cowboy.  Monroe.  Naked cowboy.  Here.  Now.  Lou.  Lou.  Lou.  Mary.  Murr.  Murr.  Thanks, man.  Lou.  Well, there's radio, there's edgy, there's psychotic, and then there's O&M. 
[00:40:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You guys are an undisciplined child wielding ultimate power.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  If you're in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, please call us, 866-277-4WOW.  In the studio, Anthony.  Come on, Al Snow from the WWF.  Yes, no, yes.  Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy.  It's a Billy Baroo.  He loves Caddyshack like we do. 
[00:41:00]  Yes.  There's no gambling at Bushwoods.  And he's the host of Tough Enough on MTV.  Yep.  Got to tell you, you came in when the show first started.  Yeah.  And I was immediately hooked.  I watched, like, the first two or three episodes.  Very good concept.  Do you want to explain it to people that might not be familiar with it?  Well, it was, you know, it was kind of like the real world meets Survivor type of situation  where take 13 kids who wanted to be WWF superstars, which was really kind of cool because this 
[00:41:30]  is what separated this show from any other reality show out there that you didn't see.  And maybe that was the bad thing, but you didn't see people going on there humiliating themselves,  degrading themselves just for money or just to be a TV star.  And they wanted to do this.  They wanted to pursue it as, you know, it was a dream.  So, whether you're a wrestling fan or not, at least you could relate to that for those  people out there who were at one time 19 or 20 and wanted to be a rock star or the most 
[00:42:00]  glamorous job of all, radio DJ.  Yeah.  And you didn't pursue your dream and now you're chained to your desk working nine to five.  You can relate to this, whether you like wrestling or not.  Yeah.  And these kids come in and then they try to, you know, we'd start training them and either  they would quit because they found out.  Well, just like every other reality show that Anthony, every week someone had to leave.  Someone asked to leave.  We were going to cut them and damn it, we only got to cut two.  Yeah.  Because what happened every week, someone was getting hurt to the point they had to quit. 
[00:42:30]  Or they just walked out.  The first three dropped.  We lost three in four days.  Wow.  They just said, that's it.  Yeah.  We lost a big gassed up fellow Jason.  You know, oh, I'm so muscular.  He was going three days.  I'm so muscular.  And then the next day, the two chicks dropped.  Yeah, you got to understand, you know, they would beat the crap out of these kids.  There was no pussyfooting around.  But I wasn't doing anything more harsh than I would any other time.  I mean, I ran the same type of school for seven years and I didn't put these kids through 
[00:43:00]  anything different.  What was some of the toughest stuff that you would consider that some of the toughest  stuff that they had to go through that might have caused the people that left to wash  out?  Getting up every day and going through it again and again and again.  Just knowing that you're going to have to be slammed down.  We were on the other day.  Just taking serious bumps over and over and over again.  Taylor, the one that's left, the one girl that's left, she said the other day, she said,  you know, we'd go home.  It was like nine, ten o'clock at night by the time we'd get home.  She said, you'd stay up for two hours because you didn't want to go to bed because that meant 
[00:43:30]  you'd just get up that much quicker and start it all over again.  And I went, wow, that's a great way to look at it.  I didn't even realize that I was pushing you like that.  I want to feel an old beat up and then you got to wake up and know that it's coming again.  I want to thank MTV because I was hooked on the show and then whatever, something happened  and I didn't watch for like five or six weeks.  And Stinky's a huge fan too.  The guy answering the phones, MTV did a tough enough marathon this weekend, so I'm all  caught up.  Ah, MTV and their marathons. 
[00:44:00]  It's like crack.  Who said that on our show?  Because it's so true.  When they do like the real world marathons of Mario.  I ended up watching Making the Band, you know?  Right.  And I'm thinking to myself, God, I've got to stop this.  Why am I watching?  Please.  When they do these marathons, like, I forgot who said it because I don't want to see Mario  can't talk.  Was it Mario?  It's like, you sit there and you're like, one more, one more.  Right.  And then I'll get out of the house.  One more, one more.  Oh, that ended with like a little cliffhanger thing.  I've got to at least watch the beginning of the next episode.  And you started watching at 10 in the morning and then you're like, well, I still want to, 
[00:44:30]  you know, catch some sunlight.  It's Sunday.  It's a gorgeous afternoon.  You wasted the whole day.  Watching O-Town.  Also, it's 7 o'clock at night.  Yeah, it was, it was sad.  I'm sitting there watching, I started watching it and I'm thinking, you know, how much drama  can there be?  Oh, Joey showed up and he knew the dance moves before I did.  Get the hell off my TV.  But I couldn't force myself to change the channel or get up and leave the house.  Yeah, that happens.  It was like Satan had entered my abode, you know? 
[00:45:00]  I could see Cerberus at the gates.  I was going into hell.  I had the coins on my eyes.  I was traveling across the river Styx.  I was going to O-Town hell.  O-Town hell.  O-Town hell.  Yeah, but Ope got helped out with the marathon.  Yeah, so now I'm caught up.  I think you're down to five or five, three guys, two girls.  Yep.  Nydia.  Nydia.  Taylor.  Yep.  Chris, the Harvard guy.  Yep.  Who I made go to Yale.  How pathetic am I in?  Maven.  And Josh.  Josh.  Yeah.  The kid, he only weighs 135 pounds or something like that? 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Wow, he's still in.  I'll tell you what, that kid has got so much heart.  He's got a huge heart.  He's got so much passion.  And the kid, he can out-wrestle them all in the ring when it comes to actually performing  in the ring.  Yeah, but WWF is going in that direction.  A lot of smaller guys.  Yeah, so it's really, honest to God, it's anybody's race tonight.  But you guys got Spike Dudley.  I mean, how big is that guy?  Hey, he's not any bigger than Josh.  Right.  But Josh is actually, I think, more talented.  Come on.  Seriously.  Yeah, without a doubt.  Wow.  Look at that. 
[00:46:00]  Josh is one of the, you know, is one of those rare ones that he can not only look good  when he's in the ring, but he can make everybody else that he's in there look better than what  they really are.  Yeah, you took a liking to Josh.  I took a liking to them all.  Yeah, he's like the big brother.  But Josh was-  I asked him off air, though.  I'm like, come on.  Tell me you don't want to do Nydia.  No, I want to do Josh.  That way it looks big in his little hand.  One of the episodes.  Oh, God.  Jesus, man.  You're hanging out with me fully too much, bro.  So, one of the episodes over the weekend, they were comparing their- 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, where they were hitting the ropes.  That was just from hitting the ropes.  That's-  And that happens to all you guys?  Yeah, yeah.  They were comparing the marks that the ropes leave, Anthony.  Yeah.  Just completely like raw chopped meat.  Yeah.  And I did that because it was entertaining to me.  Yeah.  I was the guy.  I didn't make him stand-  You know, I didn't make him put it up there for the camera.  Like, hey, show this to the camera.  I was like, show me your bruises so I can see.  So, I just started laughing.  Because it's funny.  Damn, that's cruel.  So, what's going to happen-  I love it. 
[00:47:00]  So, what's going to happen tonight?  You've got five people left.  Five people left.  You know, we'll have the final, final episode, the taped episode tonight.  That'll finish out the story.  Right.  And then, at 10.30, we'll find out who actually won.  Are you booting one before-  Nope.  Nope.  It's up in the air.  And how do you decide who does win?  I don't know.  Really?  Uh-uh.  I've-  Is that some kind of test?  No, they've made the-  You know, they've already made through the test.  They've been evaluated this whole time.  So, some board picks the- 
[00:47:30]  I think it's, you know, I'm sure Vince will have a say in it.  I'm sure-  Vince is going to decide.  Jay-  He's going to decide.  Who's the vice president of talent relations.  Kevin Dunn is the executive producer.  I know Big, who's the talent scout.  He'll be-  Yeah.  Have a say in it.  You know, they ask for my opinion, Taz's opinion, Jackie's opinion, and then they'll-  Yeah.  They'll just-  So, 10 o'clock tonight on MTV, last episode, taped episode, and then you guys are going  live from the WWF restaurant.  Yeah, from Times Square.  I might go down there tonight, 10.30, right?  It's going to be cool.  Really, it is.  And then, you know, we'll find out- 
[00:48:00]  And this guy, and then the winner gets a contract.  Yeah, and then they'll have a match either-  I think it's like, not this week, but the following week on SmackDown.  Wow.  Against who?  I don't know.  I have no idea.  I know it'll be against the WWF restaurant.  I know these guys have trained hard, but then a week later, you're really wrestling  with one of the guys?  Literally thrown from the frying pan into the fire.  If it's one of the girls, is Vince going to come out, take your bra off and take it  off now.  Call her off like a dog.  Well, if it had been Daryl, he could have said that, too.  Take your bra off and take it off now.  I love that one. 
[00:48:30]  He could have said it to Daryl, too.  He had the man's ear going.  Yeah, the man boobies.  Yes.  We love Vince Clips.  You're doing your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it.  Call her out like a dog.  That was some of the best things.  Call her out like a dog.  Call her out like a dog.  Well, everybody-  That was the stuff that-  Those were the clips that were played during his Bob Costas interview, wasn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah, and he's like, isn't this degrading to him?  And Vince is just leaning over, looking at Bob's face like, you're a dick. 
[00:49:00]  Don't you get this?  I was hoping he was going to punch Bob Costas.  Oh, that would have been great.  A couple of times when Bob pulled his head back as Vince leaned in a little too quick.  He intimidated Bob Costas so bad.  And then the next day, Bob's on all the talk shows going, you know, I showed him.  I pointed out my opinions.  I wish we could have checked his pants after that interview.  Hey, he intimidates all of us.  I mean, come on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Costas is going to act like he hung in there with Vince.  No, he didn't.  Now, take your blouse off.  Come on. 
[00:49:30]  Take it off now.  Now.  Now.  I'm wondering what color panties you're wearing tonight.  We got them all.  Do the cuffs match the color?  You're fired.  You're fired.  Do they sell that?  The WWF should put that product out.  It's called Vince Phlegm.  But you can just, you drink it, and everything you see sounds like this.  You're fired.  I'm fired. 
[00:50:00]  All of a sudden, he turns into Mr. Spacely.  Jetson, you're fired.  Let's go to Bill.  Hey, Bill, what's up?  How you doing, Opie?  We're hanging with Al Snow today.  I got two things to say to Al.  First of all, I'd like to say that I think it's a big slap in the face to the independent wrestlers  that they have tough enough because Al should know himself that, you know, you travel all  the different little high school gyms and wrestle your ass off.  And, you know, I was a former member of Monster Factory, and I wrestled, you know, almost every 
[00:50:30]  weekend driving three, four hundred miles to get little or no pay.  And that, watch these kids walk in off the street and get a contract, you know, is like a slap  in the face to all of us.  Didn't everybody have a chance?  Oh, hold on, hold on now.  How is it a slap in the face to you?  How long have you been doing this?  I've been doing it about ten years.  Did you try to get into this?  No, I didn't try to get into it.  Why didn't you then go down and show them your stuff? 
[00:51:00]  And if you're good enough to...  Because let's face it, it's all about who's perfect, you know, not who has the wrestling  ability.  You got the guys from Jersey All Pro that wrestle their hearts out and that have great matches.  I'm not doubting that, you know, any of these kids don't have the ability.  It's just that...  Hold on, let me say...  You know, they didn't pay their dues.  In fact, you guys said...  Hold on, hold on.  Let me tell you something, okay?  Let me set you straight, because I spent 13 years traveling up and down the roads for  nothing, just to get a break. 
[00:51:30]  And then when I did get the break, I sat at home for two years and starved, because I  didn't have a guaranteed contract with the WWF, and then wanted to quit, and they wouldn't  let me, and they put me on loan to ECW.  Then I made my own break.  When you get your break, it's just you get your break, and these kids happen to get their  break.  You can't begrudge them that.  If anybody should resent them, it should be me and nobody else.  God damn.  But you even admitted it in Tough Enough when you said to the guys, you're a mile ahead  of where you should be.  That you're damn right, but you may get your shot some other time. 
[00:52:00]  You never know.  There was nothing that kept you from making a tape and sending it in.  That was open to everybody.  Same with, if I might plug this, Tough Enough 2, and we're accepting tapes now, dink, that  you can send in.  You could call him a dick.  Oh, okay, dick.  Well, if Al wants to wrestle me, I'll challenge him in front of his students.  You know, let's see how good he really is.  You know, I guarantee he won't pitch me up.  Believe me, I am incredibly good. 
[00:52:30]  Otherwise, I wouldn't have lasted 19 years doing this.  Okay, but agree with me.  When you last as long as I do, Chuckles, then you come and give me a call.  Okay, but wrestling is a politic game, though.  Thank you, Bill.  It is not totally a politic game.  Thank you, Bill.  If the guy doesn't understand what you were saying, you make your breaks and you get  your breaks.  Some people get their breaks, and they're a lot better breaks than others.  It's part of life.  And that's the way the entertainment business is.  Right.  Music, you know, you name it.  That's the way it is. 
[00:53:00]  Look at me, Jesus Christ.  I was not contend installing air conditioning.  Opie's been doing this.  How long?  Opie's been in this for years.  I've been doing radio for 20 years.  I knocked on the door at one of the stations.  And you walked right in.  And all of a sudden, there.  I'm in the Boston market.  Now, I'm in New York.  And I never held a grudge.  No.  I was pretty much the Al Snow.  I was traveling from city to city, small station to small station, hoping for my break.  Working in anonymity, never giving a break.  Didn't like any money.  Hey, could I be on the radio?  Right.  Hey.  Digging up chains literally to eat. 
[00:53:30]  No joke.  Yeah.  Hey.  Thank you, Buffalo.  I used to cook on the engine of my car.  All right.  Yeah, the Car-B-Q.  And then I...  The Car-B-Q.  I swear, I called it the Car-B-Q.  And then I, you know, I was starting to get some success, ran into Anthony and brought  him aboard.  And it was...  I never held a grudge.  Yeah.  He helped my career, certainly, and I helped him.  Yeah.  But once you get your break, then you got to make something of it.  That's right.  You know, you get your foot in the door and then you go from there.  But you can't sit there and piss and moan and blame everybody else and, you know, I'm  so great and that's the reason I'm not getting it is because they're just scared of me or 
[00:54:00]  it's all politics.  Yeah, bull.  Let's see if he gets off his ass and sends a tape in for a tough enough show.  Because we're specifically taking people with experience this time.  Oh, you are?  Yeah.  Nice.  Okay, there you go.  So it's different from the first show.  There's your effing invitation.  Candy, what's going on?  I'm begging you.  Hello.  Hey.  Hello, Candy.  Hey.  Hey.  I just wanted to tell Al that I think he's really cool.  And I think he's doing a really great job on tough enough.  And you're a really cool person.  Well, thank you.  Keep making phone calls like this, Obie. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, I met you a few years ago in Queens when you were in ECW and you were like really  cool then.  I got your autograph and everything.  So I just wanted to say, you know, I just think you're really cool.  And you were like the best person there on tough enough.  Well, thank you very much.  I'm glad that you got a contract.  Forget those other people.  Yeah, forget them.  All right.  Thank you, Candy.  All right.  You take care.  You're my family.  All right.  But people get hot when you tell them, hey, you're eating bowling sandwiches next week  because I ain't employed anymore.  Hey, Chris, you're next with Al Snow.  Hey, Al. 
[00:55:00]  What's up?  Hey, how you doing, man?  I just want to say that I think that, you know, you're one of the guys who makes wrestling  fun to watch for me.  Like, you know, guys like you and Mick Foley and people like that.  Yeah.  When is head coming back?  Head?  You know, I don't know because they've given my gimmick to everybody else since I left.  So, you know, with Perry, he had Moppy.  Yeah, Moppy.  That's right.  Moppy.  Yeah, but there's only head.  Little known fact, Al's little action figure was recalled because of the head.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which is ridiculous.  Old Salem witch trial thing, you know.  Well, you know what it is.  Everyone realized it was the fake little wig type head that you carry around, but somebody 
[00:55:30]  thought it was a woman's head.  Two women who were assistant professors of all things communications.  There you go.  Actually, I went to a Walmart and then went, oh, we don't know anything about this particular  subject, but we'll just assume and make presumptions.  It's a severed woman's head.  Yeah, and we'll, you know, it's a...  Al, doesn't that piss you off that they crack to this pressure?  Hell no.  It pisses me off that societies like that today...  That's what I mean, because...  That they fall just because two women wrote a letter.  Yeah, they probably didn't get many complaints. 
[00:56:00]  It might have been just those two women.  We have a similar situation going on in Boston.  They pulled all of our bus boards, you know, the big advertising on the buses, because  it says, Opie and Anthony, wow, WBCN.  Really?  And we're known for wow.  We're from Mount Wednesday, of course, but it's not offensive if you just see wow on a  billboard.  No instructions as to what to do when you see a wow.  Just W-O-W, the word wow.  And people got to understand, too, that what you view as an adult is completely different  than what a child views. 
[00:56:30]  They're just going to see wow.  Right.  For me, they just, and honestly, when I said, what does everybody want, and I met head,  was because it was a, not a, it was a double entendre for the adults.  I love the double entendres.  For the kids, it was the fact that here I've worked all these years, and now the head is  what everybody cheers for, not me.  Right.  Which is still getting me on.  So, two people complained about our campaign in Boston.  Two people complained.  And the MBTA up there cracked and just got rid of, well, they're in the process of getting  rid of all of it.  Pulled the ads.  I mean, two people. 
[00:57:00]  That's a shame.  Because I thought that it was where a majority ruled in the society.  Not anymore.  We're doomed as a society.  We're a bunch of pussies.  We, we, you know, someone with a letterhead can scare you now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You just immediately.  A group with a letterhead can, can scare you.  They'll just fall under pressure.  Right.  You know, if you get enough in the right publicity in the right market, and everybody will just  drop like a house of cards.  Hey, Chris, we interrupted you.  You have a question for Al?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's okay.  Al, I was reading out Mick Foley's first book.  He was talking about a match, and I kind of recall, but I kind of don't. 
[00:57:30]  How many times?  It was, it was, it was you and, or it was you and Owen Hart.  Oh.  And, uh, they said that you guys, like, just purposely stuck up the place.  Yeah.  And, you know, it's just matches like that, you know, and stuff like that about you that,  you know, wanted to let you know.  We didn't stink up the place, it was a stink up from the boys' opinion, you know, watching  it, and that we purposely were just doing it so bad, but it was also, the fans got a  kick out of it, because we just did it so bad, it was funny.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, I think I remember watching it, I'm going to take through the videos. 
[00:58:00]  Oh.  But, uh.  Yeah, Owen was infamous for doing stuff like that, where he would, like, Lex Luger would  go to try and, you know, push him over his head, you know, give him the big gorilla  press, and he'd go limp so that he couldn't do it.  It's like, Lex's whole gimmick was, he was so super strong, and then he just could not  shove Owen over his head, and Owen would just be like a, you know, like a sponge, and he'd  be, uh, uh, and he'd slam him, and then Lex would get hot and tag in Davey, and Davey  would come in, and Owen would stiffen right up, and he'd boom, hit the elbow in the air  and make Davey look like a million bucks.  Owen was another one of those guys. 
[00:58:30]  Right.  All right.  But, uh, anyway, yeah, thanks a lot, I just want to let you know that, you know, and for  people that really know wrestling, and, you know, that watch it a lot, we all know  that, you know, you are absolutely one of those guys who can, who can make somebody  else look better in the ring because of the way you take moves and stuff like that.  I just try to be entertaining and give people their money's worth it, that's all I care about.  Call, Chris, thank you.  All right, thank you.  All right.  Let's, uh, go to Mike.  Mike, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, Mike.  I'm here.  Oh, hello, Mike.  Let's go, Mike. 
[00:59:00]  How are you?  Good, Mike, how are you?  Oh, hey, Al, I've heard that when Triple H comes back, that Hulk Hogan is bringing back Eric  Bishop, is it, is that any true to that story?  I don't know.  Hey, brother.  We need the, uh, real American hero back, I think, now.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  I have no idea.  Imagine the Hulk's.  Because, I mean, a friend of a friend told me, that's what it says on the, that's what  it says on the internet.  Well, you know, if it's on the internet, it's true.  It's true.  Absolutely.  I, you know, I base my whole life on what I see on the internet. 
[00:59:30]  On the internet.  Yeah.  Any other WCW wrestlers coming, coming aboard?  You know, I don't know.  Take your vitamins, brother.  I've heard, I've heard Goldberg might come back in two years.  Uh, if he's smart.  I've heard that Scott Hall and Kevin Nash and the Steiner brothers might be coming back.  Well, I'm sure, they may.  Wait, wait, I want to hear what he has to say about Goldberg.  You said if he's smart.  Goldberg's smart.  The guy hates the business.  He only did it for the money.  He's making, he's a millionaire now, and he's sitting at home doing nothing.  Why would you want to come back and work harder than you ever did before?  Because that's, that's, that's what they're saying.  And that's what the internet's saying.  Well, yeah, of course. 
[01:00:00]  Again, it's on the internet.  So, damn it, it's true.  Is it any true that you might come back as, you know, try to fight a number one contender  for the WCW world title or the WWF world title?  Who knows?  I'm like the Ray Bork of wrestling, you know?  So, it took him, what, 21 years to get a Stanley Cup?  Stanley Cup.  So, I've got another two years to go, and then, you know, the title's mine, so.  Do you think you'll be able to jump to the faction with Stephanie and her brother Shane?  I don't know.  Her voice is like a dog whistle sometimes.  Yeah, but how about those breast implants?  Oh, hey. 
[01:00:30]  Water wings all the way, baby.  We had her.  Salty dogs.  We had her on the show, and she told us she would never get breast implants.  Yeah.  Fast forward six months later, and boom, not only did she get them, she got the biggest  ones available.  They went in there, they were on the rack, and she went, I'll take the extra large ones.  I'll take the big ones.  I was saying, she looks a hell of a lot different than she did Chained Up to the Boiler when The  Undertaker.  She looked so innocent.  I know.  Yeah, she's in there, Daddy! 
[01:01:00]  And you were excited, weren't you?  Oh, damn, hell yeah, who wasn't?  Chained her up to the boiler, yeah, you sexy bitch.  Right.  Sexy bitch!  Why don't we take a break?  We only have a few minutes left with Alistair.  I want to hear Jimmy Snuka.  Yeah, we're going to play that for you.  We've got plenty of time, Opie, until 445.  All right, that's only a few minutes after we come back from break.  Oh, all right.  Jimmy Snuka.  You never let me stay that long.  I enjoy coming here and hanging out with you guys, and you just like rush me in and 
[01:01:30]  rush me out.  That's not true.  Pick me at you like a bowling ball, you know, you stick the three fingers in me, throw me  down the alley.  You're famous now because it's tough enough.  Well, of course you can hang out longer.  Yeah, like Carson Daly.  Like Carson.  There you go.  I have the nerve, though, to admit that I don't know crap about MTV, okay?  I am totally unhip.  Carson Daly, just as unhip, but even less talented.  And the man can step in a bucket left and right and still come out smelling like a roast.  I'm going to spear him if I ever show up on TRL. 
[01:02:00]  I'm kicking Carson Daly's ass.  Hey, man, the guy could read, though.  And his lips move at the same time.  Yeah, he's a great reader.  I dare the camera to be here to the left and the cue card to the right, and he just blatantly  turned right to the right and read it.  Up next on TRL.  Who's Carson in training?  Carson, at least act like you're not reading.  Who's the guy that got now the Carson in training?  I don't know.  Young Carson.  You see this new guy that got on MTV?  Yeah.  And he looks like a younger version of Carson.  They're cloning Carson.  Are they cloning Carson's now because he's done so well? 
[01:02:30]  Can I...  I want to give a warning here.  You might want to open the door.  I'm busting ass as we speak.  Oh, my God.  Hey, how bad can an owl's snow fart smell?  Oh, pretty bad.  Hello.  Between the high protein and the starburst jelly beans.  And I've ate enough protein today that my ass is going to be like a root beer dispenser  in a couple hours.  Oh, God.  You know what?  We're going to bring Stalker Patty in now.  Well, if you do, she might pass out when she walks through the door.  I can drop them, believe me.  Especially if you mix this with some carbonation and the protein and starburst jelly beans. 
[01:03:00]  We're going to take a break.  It actually burned my rectum there.  For Al Snow, we've got to play the Jimmy Superfly Snooker thing.  Please.  Well, this is a guy that took a few too many chair shots.  A few too many chair shots and a few too many whatever.  And he jumps off the top rope.  Loved the guy growing up.  But he's not all there anymore, unfortunately.  And we asked him to do an ID for our show.  This is one of our favorite things we play.  And it took him a while to get it right.  Here it is.  Jimmy Superfly Snooker.

Al Snow from the WWF and host of Tough Enough on MTV.  The final taped episode is at 10 o'clock tonight,  and then they go live from the WWF restaurant at 1030  to announce the winner of Tough Enough.  Yeah.  I think a bunch of us are going to go down and check it out.  It'll be a blast.  I'm telling you, it's going to be a hell of a show. 
[01:06:30]  You know, it's going to be pretty emotional for a lot of people.  And, you know, it'll be pretty cool.  Mike is busting your balls on instant feedback.  He writes,  Hey, is Al Snow going to fly off in a helicopter  in the last episode of Tough Enough  and then fly back into the final show?  I'll tell you what I'm going to do.  I'm going to fly off in a helicopter  and land in MTV Studios  and beat the hell out of Carson Daly.  You're not going to pull a Jeff Probst  and just take off at the end of the episode in a helicopter?  Wouldn't it be cool, though?  You know, with my luck, I'd fall out, though.  Yeah.  Fall out on your head. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  Just, ah, ah, boom.  And John writes,  Ask this dude.  This dude.  Ask this dude.  His name is Al Snow.  Whatever happened to the Brooklyn Brawler?  I was shocked because on one of the episodes  of Tough Enough over the weekend on MTV,  I saw the Brooklyn Brawler.  The man, the myth, the legend of the Brooklyn Brawler.  He still works for the WWF?  Yeah, he does.  He works, ah, he does quite a few different responsibilities  at TV.  He takes care of making sure that a lot of pre-tapes 
[01:07:30]  and things that guys have to do,  he goes out and rounds them up and gets them done.  Oh, yeah.  And he's a great guy.  He's hilarious.  So, you know, he allowed the kids to go back  and cut promos and see what it was like  to actually go back and do that.  And it was cool.  Very cool.  All right, let's go right to the phones.  Everyone wants to say hi to Al.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, Mike, you're on the radio, bro.  Hey, what's going on?  I just wanted to call and let you guys know  that Al Snow is probably one of the only five wrestlers  that actually takes time out to actually speak to his fans. 
[01:08:00]  And I just want to let him know how much I appreciate that.  Hey, I appreciate the fact that you want to speak to me  because, you know, normally I have to, like,  chase people down and, like, tackle them  and, you know, please talk to me, anybody.  Yeah.  Especially women.  Yeah.  But I figured that out, okay?  Just a little advice from Uncle Al.  Use the panel van and the bottle of chloroform.  It makes dating a lot easier.  Hey, I just wanted to know,  I was in Unforgiven on Sunday.  Yeah.  And I just wanted to let the boys know that  Bubba Ray was talking a lot of trash. 
[01:08:30]  No, we're going to deal with that off the air.  There's some weasel trying to cause trouble,  and we're going to talk to him.  All right.  Hey.  I don't even want to mention it on the air.  I ain't going to say nothing about it.  Can I ask Al Snow one more question?  Yep.  Go ahead, real quick.  Hey, when these guys actually get the contract for the WWF,  Yeah.  When they start the matches,  is it going to depend on whether the fans actually take to them,  or is that contract actually guaranteed?  Yeah, it's a guaranteed contract.  They have a guaranteed developmental contract,  which is worth quite a bit of money.  Oh, I bet.  For one year to prove themselves 
[01:09:00]  and to show that they're marketable  and that they're going to be WWE superstars.  And they'll start out with one of their first matches  being on a SmackDown.  Oh, pretty cool.  I do see the crowd not giving them support  when they first come out into the ring.  You think so?  Yeah.  You know, every time I've made a public appearance,  with them,  the only one that they don't give public support  has been Chris from Harvard.  Really?  Yeah, they just...  Who was on the phone and he hung up.  So, Chris, if you're still listening,  call us back.  He's the only one that they truly turn against.  Really? 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, they just absolutely...  Well, they kind of had an attitude during the war.  Don't like a Harvard man.  Well, you know,  I had to take the Harvard man to Yale.  I'm sure Opie saw where he lost the bet  and I took him to Yale.  Yeah.  Made him pretty funny.  And pronounced he was Yale's bitch.  Wow.  Walk up to...  And he could only wear the Harvard boxy shorts  and nothing else.  Yeah.  They put a sign around him  or you wrote it on him, right?  We had him carry signs that said,  I'm Yale's bitch and Harvard sucks.  Oh, wow.  That's rough for a Harvard guy.  And his coach,  because he played for the Harvard football team.  Yeah. 
[01:10:00]  Which, you know,  in the Ivy League,  I'm sure that doesn't...  I guess a football...  If you're not careful,  a football game would break out on the weekend.  It's a lot like...  Why would?  Not like Ohio State with, like, Moose McCullough, you know.  He's a 10-year...  He's a third-year redshirt freshman, you know.  His wife and kids are up in the stands.  Hey!  You know what I mean?  It's kind of different in Ohio, you know.  We kind of...  You know, he's his major scuba diving, you know,  things like that.  My word.  My word.  Hey, Justin, what's going on? 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  I just had a question for Al.  I remember, like, 10 years ago,  when all the crap happened in golf,  a big gimmick in the WWF  was Hulk Hogan and Sergeant Slaughter.  Hulk Hogan being the real American hero,  as you guys said earlier,  and Sergeant Slaughter being the Iraqi.  Right.  I was just wondering if Al thought that,  in light of all that happened in New York two weeks ago,  that something like that in the WWF  could be another gimmick to come out,  and if it would even be appropriate, 
[01:11:00]  and if not...  Okay, I can see where you're going with this,  and I'll try and explain it to you,  because I've been asked this question already once today,  and I'll tell you that, you know,  wrestling has always been kind of a mirror of society.  I mean, that's how we develop our characters and stuff,  so that people can easily relate to us,  because physically you can't relate to what we do in the ring.  But with that being said,  you know, 10 years ago it was a different time,  it was a different situation.  The enemy was a clear-cut enemy.  We knew who it was. 
[01:11:30]  We knew where it happened.  It did not occur on our shores, necessarily, you know,  not to take away from what the situation was,  as compared to this one.  I understand completely, yeah.  And people are a lot more sophisticated at this point now  than they used to be 10 years ago.  My own children are probably more sophisticated than I am now.  You know, at 38, my 12- and 13-year-old are more sophisticated.  They have far more access to immediate information than I've ever had.  And, you know, it's a fine line that you walk in entertainment 
[01:12:00]  between what's entertaining and what's in bad taste.  And, you know, I don't foresee that there will ever come a time anytime soon,  or even after that, that we'll probably have some portrayal of any sort  of the tragedy within the World Wrestling Federation.  Yeah, it would look like it was being exploited.  Yeah, you know, and, you know, some situations in entertainment,  I'm sure maybe they can lampoon it, or, you know,  maybe Saturday Night Live can get away with a little bit of it, but really... 
[01:12:30]  I'm wondering what they're going to do Saturday.  Yeah, you know, it'll be interesting to see.  But, you know, at the same time, I just don't see with wrestling  that we could do that, and I don't think that we will.  You know, and really, a lot of people were very intimately affected  by this tragedy that worked for the WWF, because, you know, as you guys know,  so many people worked in that building.  I mean, I had a friend who works for the Secret Service  that just by luck he changed the schedule before that day  and was heading into work when that occurred,  and thousands of stories like that, I'm sure you hear, of people. 
[01:13:00]  And, you know, so it's...  I don't think that you're going to see anything like that on our part.  I certainly don't.  And it's strange listening to someone from the WWF  talking about good taste and bad taste.  But it's true, because we got a lot of that, too,  where the type of show that we do,  all of a sudden something like this happens.  People tune in going, all right, what are they going to do?  Are you going to joke about it?  Are you going to make a bid or something?  You know, send nude women down there? 
[01:13:30]  Right.  No, it was an honest response to what happened.  We got on the air for a good week and a half, pretty much,  and just let people talk, and we talked about it.  And situations like that, you just go with your heart.  And I think, if I remember correctly,  wasn't there a boy who called from that?  His father?  Yeah, his father.  17-year-old kid.  We had to, you know, we took him down.  You know, because I listen to you guys' show, honestly.  I'm not just saying I'm in here in the room with you.  It was the worst phone call I think we've ever taken.  Here's a kid just losing his mind, crying, saying, 
[01:14:00]  I lost my father today.  But how incredible the way, I mean, he,  I just was amazed at the maturity level that he had at 17.  I mean, and the strength that he had to be able to pick up that phone  and call you guys.  And obviously, you served a purpose.  You obviously, you know, you were an outlet.  And that's all we are with the WWF is just an outlet.  We're just entertainment, you know.  And if you try to make it into something that it's not,  that's when, you know, people, you know,  cause it to be something other than what it really intended to be in the first place. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, it's when stuff like that happens that it kind of defines  what your form of entertainment's all about.  And you guys, just like us, I mean, we were demonized a little bit, I'm sure,  cause I didn't hear any of the criticism.  But, you know, we probably were demonized a little bit  for going on with the show on SmackDown.  But a lot of the guys, I mean, that was, that's what they do.  They entertain.  And that was the only way that they knew how to help out,  just like you guys doing your radio show.  That's the only way you know how to help out and to do what you do and just go on.  You know what, though?  It does put everything in perspective as far as how many complaints have come in 
[01:15:00]  about maybe too much cleavage showing on the WWF.  And how many complaints have we gotten about content on our show?  Because all of a sudden that's not very important anymore.  And it puts it in the perspective that it should have been in.  Right.  In the first place.  Unfortunately, that has to happen for people to snap out of it.  And hopefully we'll get back to the day where people can bitch about stupid stuff  like too much cleavage on SmackDown.  I got to tell Al, you know, the WWF helped us out because we were playing all the stuff 
[01:15:30]  you guys had to say.  I heard you.  I was going to.  And we were looking for some comedy at that point.  Anything.  Anything.  Yeah.  Just to kind of like, wow, look at what Stephanie was saying.  And we, you know, we goofed, but we, we, uh, they put an implant in her head too.  We did have a good time.  Well, you know, and that's what it's for.  I mean.  But we understood how serious you guys were and you were speaking from the heart.  We were like, we were at that point, we were searching and we, we needed to laugh 
[01:16:00]  ourselves.  That's why many of the, many of the, you know, some of the speeches that you couldn't, I  mean, you just could not write them.  I mean, they were, they really were heartfelt, you know, really good.  And some of them that you could play with, you played with.  And how many of the ones we did play that after it was done, we went, oh, um, okay.  You know, cause there was nothing you could say.  What are you going to, oh, listen to them.  You know.  Well, when Bradshaw said that there's some German guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some, you know, back a few years ago in Germany, there was some guy that, you know, we lost 
[01:16:30]  our minds on that.  It was like, hey, some, I don't know, some guy.  Some maniac.  Yeah, some maniac.  That was it.  Some maniac.  In his defense though, I mean, when, you know, you get that emotional.  No, you're right.  It's hard to be eloquent.  We understand all that, but, you know, we needed to try to laugh or do something.  And it was a release, you know, and that really, that's what they put the show on for was that  it was a release.  It wasn't, it wasn't evil Vince, you know, trying to make a buck or anything like that.  Well, when we heard Vince's speech, we're like, now that's someone you want to lead the army 
[01:17:00]  in Afghanistan.  Oh, yeah.  Go over there and make stained glass.  Hey, are you guys changing the name of, um, one of the pay-per-views, Armageddon?  I think so, yeah.  Oh, wow.  I'm not sure.  I really don't know.  Interesting.  But, you know, I probably should keep my opinion to myself.  I forgot what you guys are changing it to.  No, you know something?  I don't agree with some of those things that are being changed.  I don't either.  I don't agree with the World Trade Center being digitally removed from movies.  You know why I don't agree with that?  Because the worst crime, I think, that could ever be possibly perpetrated, which is child molestation, 
[01:17:30]  because you're stealing something that can never be given back to that, it's innocence.  Yeah.  Because, and you don't see people running out and taking that out of a show.  Like, you know, I read in USA Today that the, uh, whatever that, that CIA one, uh, new show  that's coming on, that they were going to have an episode that was coming up where they were  going to actually, and I guess it had been in the can for some time, thwart a terrorist  plan to blow up Harrods in England by Osama bin Laden.  Now, all of a sudden, it's like, we can't air that.  Why? 
[01:18:00]  Why?  Because you don't stop airing, like, crime, you know, whatever the CSI or victimized  whatever crime show that is.  Yeah, one of those shows, yeah.  Because they shoot somebody in the head or they had molest a child.  In fact, oh, let's rush that right on the air.  Yeah.  You know, and when John Bonnet Ramsey got killed, well, let's have 52 movies.  Oh, they made a bunch of movies about that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, thank God Norton's not here.  And I'm not taking away from the tragic situation.  I mean, it's incredibly, incredibly tragic.  And I feel for these people.  And my heart goes out to them in my prayers. 
[01:18:30]  And, you know, and I, and like I said, I have close friends who could have, who could  have very well been lost.  There's no way they should do that.  I think a lot of the movies that are, that are being stopped and postponed because of  content is, I mean, it's ridiculous.  Just move on.  And I know some people are going to say, oh, well, we shouldn't, you know, but if you don't,  then you're doing exactly what terrorists want.  That's how they win.  You give into the terror.  You give into, that gives them power.  And I say, you know, F them.  Yeah.  I'm going to get on with my damn life. 
[01:19:00]  And I'm not going to be afraid to walk on the goddamn plane.  Right.  And fly wherever I got to fly.  God bless you.  Yeah, you, you've flown now since you guys fly all the time.  Yeah.  You guys fly every night.  How is it?  But the worst thing that happened, well, not, not, you know, it's great.  I mean, security has stepped up.  The worst thing that happened was I show, you know, cause I fly out of Dayton, Ohio.  So Saturday night I fly, I'm supposed to have a 7.30 flight.  This is my luck.  I show up seven, you know, it's 10 till six because, you know, I'm going to show up even  a little earlier.  So I make sure I get a little time.  I check my bag. 
[01:19:30]  Well, there are only three reservations for the flight.  So they cancel the flight and they didn't call me.  Oh, man.  And that's not a problem.  I show up at the ticket counter.  Nobody's there.  They all went home.  They all went home.  Dayton, Ohio.  Yeah.  I just, oh, well, three people on the flight.  We'll cast flight.  Okay, everybody.  Off we go.  All right.  You hear the keys lock up.  Early night.  Al, lock up when you leave.  So then I call the one in her number and the lady books me on a United flight and she  says, well, you have to get somebody to, you know, change over the ticket.  I said, well, I need, who can I get?  She goes, well, you need a gate agent. 
[01:20:00]  Ma'am, to get the gate agent, I need a ticket to go through security now.  Right, yeah.  I guess I'll just have to wait.  So I had to track down the lady who was working both the baggage claim area and the ticket  claim, the gate agent, to get her to do it.  Wow.  Get my ticket, rush over to United.  There's nobody there.  Oh, they all have to.  This is a rib.  No, yeah.  One guy's working the gate and the ticket counter.  They're like Jack of all trades now.  Right.  Check your bag.  It's the same guy.  They take your ticket.  Same guy.  Gate the security.  And then you look in the cockpit.  Same guy.  And there he is flying by the plane. 
[01:20:30]  Plus that he puts it on an autopilot and comes out and go, coffee team.  Drives your cab when you land.  Right.  It's great.  Takes your bags.  Use a Skycap.  Cut costs.  Jeez.  All right.  With that, we've got to get Al Snow out of here.  Oh.  Al, pleasure as always.  And, you know, any time you're in town.  Please.  I'd love to come back.  We love having you.  I'll come back and spend the whole four hours with you.  Cool.  We don't wear that at all.  Love having you in, man.  Final episode of Tough Enough.  Tonight.

Well, on the way, Anthony, Mario Cantone.  Lots of really cool things that we've still got to get to.  We've got a few.  Mario Cantone.  He's funny as hell.  He's right outside the studio.  A bunch of bad tribute songs that we've got to get to.  And Stalker Paddy.  And Stalker Paddy, very sure.  And as we go to break, John Valby, we're going to get a nice buzz on this thing.  People are digging this.  So check this out.  Here's to Osama Bin Laden. 
[01:22:00]  That towelhead scum.  May the U.S. blast his ass to King King.  He's a bagless wonder that lives in a cave.  May Marines f***ing Budweiser on that f***ing sucker he's going. 
[01:22:30]  Osama, being a chicken f***ing f***ing f***ing, lives off camel turds with a topping of maggots.  Osama thinks we don't have the guts to come and blow off his Islamic nuts.  But now America is done with his crap.  So let's just move the f***ers off the map.  So here's to Osama. 
[01:23:00]  That s*** of a b***h.  May his p***er fall off with a seven-year ips.  And may they bid on his p***ers with a big brass hammer.  Till his a**hole whistles the star spangle back.  USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! 
[01:23:30]  USA! USA! USA!  Bring on the next slide.  Daddy, can I suck on your candy?  Making teen nymphs.  Isn't this illegal?  Look what you did to me again.  There are people that think that you and I should be going to jail.  I thought we were just having fun.  Yeah, we're having fun.  Do they get ratings books in prison?  O.B. and Anthony.  Hi, Anthony.  Islander Hockey is back.  I know you don't care, but I completely care.  What do you do care? 
[01:24:00]  Stop it.  I'm telling you, we're going to have a team this year.  I remember the drive for five.  We're kicking off the 30th anniversary season of New York Islanders Hockey.  You hear how I say we?  We.  I feel like I'm part of the team.  You are.  I bought one of these mini packages.  I'm going to 21 home games.  And yes, I bought the tickets, Anthony.  That's great.  That excited about it.  How many games?  I'm going to go to like 21 home games.  I see a couple of goals scored.  I'm going to.  Shut up.  We have a good team this year.  I'm telling you, I'm going to be sitting right next to Joey Paisano, matter of fact. 
[01:24:30]  The New York Islanders have one of the lowest season ticket prices in the New York area,  with seats starting as low as $14.  They also offer the best season ticket benefits in the NHL, such as free parking for the entire season,  40% savings off the box office price, an exclusive meet and greet with the team, which is really cool.  No one else is doing that.  And almost 20 games of promotional giveaways.  If you're interested, get your tickets now.  Dial 1-800-882-ISLES.  That's 1-800-882-ISLES.  1-800-882-ISLES. 
[01:25:00]  For New York Islanders hockey.  The station for sports guys, Don and Mike, Opie and Anthony, and Ron and Fez is this station.  1027 WNEW.  New York.  Ah, system over down, Anthony.  Chop Suey.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  This is great.  It's so nice to see.  You know The Onion?  Yeah.  You ever read The Onion?  Lampoon magazine.  Love The Onion.  Online. 
[01:25:30]  Very funny.  They've actually gotten into the tragedy.  They've touched on it in their inimitable style.  The headline, hijackers surprised to find selves in hell.  And then in quotes, we expected eternal paradise for this, says Suicide Bombers.  This story coming from the outer darkness of hell.  The hijackers who carried out the September 11th attacks in the World Trade Center and Pentagon  expressed confusion and surprise Monday to find themselves in the lowest place of Nar Islam's hell. 
[01:26:00]  And in quotes, I was promised I would spend eternity in paradise being fed honey cakes by 67 virgins in a tree-lined garden.  If only I would fly the airplane into one of the towers, said Mohammed Adda, one of the hijackers of American Airlines Flight 11,  between attempts to vomit up wasps, hornets, and live coals infesting his stomach.  But instead, I'm fed the boiling feces of traitors by malicious, laughing ifrit.  Is this to be my reward for destroying the enemies of my faith?  We can only hope. 
[01:26:30]  The rest of Adda's words turned to raw-throated shrieks as a tusk, asp-tongued demon burst his eyeballs  and drank the fluid that ran down his face.  So if you want to read the rest of that, it's on theonion.com.  It's the hijackers reporting their disappointment from hell.  We can only hope.  Yeah.  Anthony, Mario Cantone will be in studio in seconds.  We gave him a little homework assignment.  He's in the other studio watching the Michael Jackson video. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, we saw this thing for the first time today, and it's a complete disgrace on so many levels.  I think he thought he was doing another thriller.  He did a long-form video movie.  Some celebrities in there.  You know, Michael Madsen's in it.  From Reservoir Dogs.  Yeah.  From many movies.  He's great.  And Chris Tucker.  Chris Tucker.  Marlon Brando's in this movie.  Marlon Brando is in it. 
[01:27:30]  And a bunch of faces you recognize as, like, character actors and whatnot.  It's filmed very well, you know.  But Michael is just a mess.  And the song really blows.  Now, I'm not a big Michael Jackson song fan.  But at least his previous songs had, like, it was a song, had a hook.  You know, a catchy hook or whatnot.  The song never gets going.  No, it seems like an intro to the song.  The song is.  It's just awful. 
[01:28:00]  Mario Quintone.  Fresh from watching the Michael Jackson video.  I am.  I have no words.  I have no.  How bad is that?  How retarded is that video?  First of all, his face.  His face.  He looks like he's wearing a mask at this point.  He looks like the comedy and tragedy mask in a drama club logo.  He looks.  And his face looks a little green.  It's a little green.  Turning green or something.  It's a little moldy. 
[01:28:30]  It looks a little moldy.  Everything's effed up on him.  Even his hands look kind of screwy.  Oh, he is.  Like, nothing works.  I hate to say this.  He looks like a burn victim.  Yeah.  He looks bad.  His hands, his face.  His face is so white, he looks like a geisha girl.  Doesn't he, though?  He's a geisha to go.  Because he's got the makeup with the really pale white skin.  He looks like a geisha.  He looks like a gay geisha.  And he's trying to be tough.  Oh, I could get away with that more.  Isn't that, yes.  He's not saying much.  Isn't that?  He's trying to be a tough guy.  When he's like, oh, Chris, I've got it. 
[01:29:00]  I've got to get handled it.  I'll get him.  He's a twig.  I'm going to take her and smack her ass and then ask her if she's got a little butt.  We have to.  That's really funny.  But we have to explain what this video is about so everyone's on the same page.  Marlon Brando's in it.  I know.  Yeah.  Because not a lot of people have seen the video yet.  I think it just started debuting yesterday.  So it's a lot like the Beat It video.  It's very much like the Beat It and the Smooth Criminal.  It's always like the gang thing and the knives.  He loves the gang thing.  But instead of fighting, they dance.  No. 
[01:29:30]  He fights via Jerome Robbins is what he fights.  It's like that choreography.  Yeah.  What's the story?  What's the storyline, though?  He falls for a girl.  Yeah, right away.  It's not believable.  And then she walks into the waterfront.  Hotel.  Hotel.  And all of a sudden there's a theater in it where he does a big dance number.  Right.  He decides now he's going to get up on stage and do a dance number in front of all these tough guys.  Oh.  Because now this girl is kind of canoodling.  Yeah, she's kind of like it. 
[01:30:00]  The Post loves that word.  Canoodling at the bar with some gangsters and Michael figures.  Michael Madsen.  Michael Madsen.  I agree to cut him with a bottle now.  And Michael Jackson goes into this bar slash hotel slash theater with his gang to start trouble.  Where am I supposed to be believing that Michael Jackson would be intimidated by Michael Madsen?  Really?  Who in Reservoir Dogs cut off a guy's ear after beating him up, pours gas on him and gets ready to burn him.  And that's all he does is dance and flick his fingers under his chin.  Yeah, he's doing some like bafangu thing. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And he does it twice.  You know what, though?  He grabs himself again, once again.  Oh, he loves that movie.  When he grabs himself.  But when he does grab himself, notice it.  Doesn't it look like he's going in?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He uses like the fingers and he's turning.  It's like he's got a vagina.  It's very strange.  It's really weird.  He actually uses the technique a lot of sex experts say to hit the G spot.  Yeah.  He's got like the curved finger thing into the second knuckle.  It's very Seca.  Yeah. 
[01:31:00]  Very Seca.  It's very Savannah.  Yeah.  He's doing that.  I'm surprised he's not lifting his breast and trying to touch his tongue to the tip of his nipple.  And then Brando's profile, and he just, he's got two lines.  The first one is, wow.  And the second one is, you look pretty cute.  And that's it.  Yeah, that's his line.  And he comes all fat, fat, fat down the steps with the flames behind him.  Yeah.  And then that's it.  He has nothing to do with it.  And then he walks away.  He walks away.  I don't even know why he was in it.  Now, he was at the concert, too.  Yeah.  Friday night.  You went to Michael Jackson's concert.  I went to Monday night, the Monday night concert. 
[01:31:30]  I heard it was insane, like a crazy person was putting on a show.  I was six rows from the front.  You were.  I did not pay.  I went for the material.  I was six rows from the front.  I saw everything.  And, oh, first of all, then you see that booth of thrones, you know.  Right, right, where he sits and lets people praise him.  Just bowing to his subject.  Yes.  Nodding his head.  And Joe Jackson with the eyebrows like the devil.  Ha-hoo, he's scary.  He's ha-hoo, he-de-hoo.  And he is the almost object.  And then you get Macaulay talking up there and the mother and Reby and Reby Jackson. 
[01:32:00]  Everybody's like, who's that?  Was Macaulay sitting next to Michael?  He kept getting up.  Did he?  He kept getting up and going back.  But all the performance, well, Liza Minnelli was there, you know.  And she came out and sang, you are not alone.  And it was like, she was like, you are not alone.  Call me on the phone.  Did she actually say the wrong word this time?  Leave a message up to the tone.  She wanted a tribute to the elephant man's bones.  She was just going off.  And then she hit this note at the end that just kind of, she fell off it. 
[01:32:30]  Uh-oh.  And she was like, you are not alone.  And that was the end.  And then she went, listen, you guys, can we, I got to tell you something.  And the crowd's a little restless.  Oh, it's all a little restless.  Can I touch you in a second?  And then she turns up and she looks at the band and she goes, could I have that note again?  And then they give her the note.  And then she does, she does Never Never Land.  And then at the end of it, she does the tag to Over the Rainbow and she goes, she goes, she goes, if happy little bloopers fly beyond the rainbow, why, oh, why? 
[01:33:00]  I love you, Michael.  Taylor!  But except it wasn't that high.  And then Liz Taylor came out with, looked like she had Disney fireworks coming out of her head.  And she's speaking to the crowd like, my best friend, Michael Jackson, is not only a consummate for her, but he is my best friend. 
[01:33:30]  He is the undisputed king.  And she puts syllables where there are none.  King of pop.  Oh, it was bizarre.  And then they did a tribute to The Wiz.  They showed The Wiz.  Oh, they did.  The Wiz, they showed.  He's on down.  He's on down.  Well, first of all, the announcer is like ridiculous.  It's like, ladies and gentlemen, from 1981, The Wiz, here he is, Al Jarreau as the scarecrow. 
[01:34:00]  And he comes out, no, as the tin man.  Al Jarreau as the tin man with blue eyeshadow going.  And then Debra Cox, who was absolutely, absolutely beautiful, and sang her ass off.  But she's the lion.  She comes out in a fur coat with a tail.  She's not the lion.  Really?  She's not the lion.  No.  And then Jill Scott doing most of her song as the scarecrow.  And Jill Scott as the scarecrow.  On a pole the whole time.  Really?  Hung up on a pole. 
[01:34:30]  I was like, get her out of the lynching position and let her sing her song.  It was terrible.  It was terrible.  Yeah.  It was upsetting.  Let the girl come up front and sing.  She was so talented, too.  She's on the cross.  She was on the cross.  She's being crucified singing.  It was like, you know.  Yeah.  John, what's going on?  Hey, Owen, how you doing?  We're hanging with Mario Cantone.  I want to ask you what Shelly Winters did at the Michael Jackson concert.  She was actually down the street doing the vagina monologues.  My vagina's all over the floor. 
[01:35:00]  Somebody pick it up.  Manny, give this to the kids.  I can swim.  I can swim.  I can swim.  I'm a good actress.  I screwed all my leading men.  Every one of them.  Al Pacino, Bobby, Laura McCall.  All of them. 
[01:35:30]  Then they showed, the other thing they did was, the interesting thing was they showed tributes.  You know, they showed film tributes of people saying how great he was.  But it was way before any of the accusations.  Oh, really?  So it was all like early 80s, yeah.  So you're seeing like people looking very young.  Well, it was weird.  And Kath and Hepburn going, Michael Jackson and I are very similar.  We're very similar.  We're two people that just go for the same thing.  Oh, my God.  Her friendship with him lasted about a day because she must have been like, look at yourself. 
[01:36:00]  You're much whiter today than you were yesterday.  Did you dip your face in DD7?  What did you do?  Scaring the hell out of me.  I may be old, but I'm not dead.  I don't need to see the grim reaper today.  She hangs around with the craziest friggin' people.  Like Liz Taylor.  Liz Taylor.  And I got to say, Liza is insane.  I love Michael.  He's my best friend.  She goes around thinking she's in another time.  I'm not in another time.  Like another time in another place. 
[01:36:30]  I'm right here now.  Stop saying that.  I think she thinks she's in like 1940s Hollywood or something.  No, I know it's 2004.  I know where I am.  Let me just say that I am so happy to be Michael's friend because you know what?  Liza with a Z.  What I'm going to do now, I'm going to do, no, because Liza with a Z, it's not Lisa with an S.  Because you know what?  I'm going to do some hip-hop for the kids.  Because the kids love the hip-hop.  And I, because you know, Liza with a Z and Jay-Z has a Z.  All right.  And then Mr. Gazoo, G-Z-U-S, he's got a Z. 
[01:37:00]  And you know, and L to the Iza, Z to the Iza.  Liza.  Liza.  Liza.  Scratch, catch, catch.  I'm so hungry.  I love to go to the IHOP.  My favorite thing at the IHOP is the Young People's Plate.  Because it has two cherry eyes, a pineapple mouth, and I think their chocolate chip nose.  But bacon eyebrows.  That's my favorite.  If they don't have the Young People's Plate, I'll just go down the street to some other  place, like donuts. 
[01:37:30]  She is insane.  I'm not alone.  Call me on the phone.  Hey, Doug, what's going on?  What's up?  Was Carmen behaving well at the concert?  Oh, good question.  I act like everybody suck ass.  I hate them all.  The stupid Asgero doing the whiz.  It didn't even look like a goddamn stupid Tin Man.  I don't remember no Tin Man with blue eyeshadow.  He looked really stupid.  And you got girls are lying.  And you girls play the scarecrackers.  Scarecrackers have pinses.  They're not women.  What's wrong with them?  I didn't like that at all. 
[01:38:00]  And Michael Dougherty, he looked like the ghost of Christmas past.  He looks really bad.  He's scary.  He's a stupid ass.  I hate you, Michael Dougherty.  Hey, Ryan, what's going on?  You're next on the OP&A show.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to know why these people, like, you know, they interview the celebrities  and they ask them about Michael, and nobody realizes that this guy is acting insane.  He's a freak.  He is a modern-day freak.  They kiss his ass, and they just talk, you know, oh, Michael's great, this and that.  Nobody says anything.  You know, he's crazy.  You know what's really upsetting about it?  Like Anthony was saying also, he was like just bowing. 
[01:38:30]  He was like he was on a throne, and he was like bowing to a subject.  And the next day was September 11th, and it was just like puts it all into perspective.  It's like you're unimportant, okay?  Right.  Yeah, you know what else?  We really care about Mariah Carey's breakdown now.  I'm just devastated at this point.  It's like everything comes into perspective.  You're unimportant.  Yeah.  Shut up that your album didn't come in at number one.  Go see Glitter.  Run!  Don't walk.  Go see Glitter. 
[01:39:00]  Glitter?  Oh, this is why she had the final breakdown.  Really?  For me?  It's hilarious.  Is it fun to watch in that kind of?  It's bad good.  Yeah, bad good.  It's not as bad good as Showgirls, but it's bad good.  Yeah, bad good.  She's brutal.  She's brutal.  Didn't you like Mariah on the tribute show, though?  Okay.  I love that she came out and sang.  Good for her.  What about during the song when she turned to her backup singer and was like,  And you know you can, sir.  I can't take it.  Just take the note.  She's like, turned around, like, take the note. 
[01:39:30]  Throwing you to the choir, like, please save me, take.  And you know you can, sir.  Take the note.  And my sister, Camille, calling me up.  Another one singing four octaves lower.  Right.  We're losing them all.  Her, Whitney Houston.  You know why we lost Whitney Houston?  Because she has bad judgment.  I'm like, what?  She has bad judgment.  Well, what do you mean?  Taste close.  She has bad judgment.  That's so true. 
[01:40:00]  They all sing.  Wait up.  Let me tell you.  Swing low.  Sweet chariot.  The upsetting thing about it is, this is, I think Whitney Houston was one of the greatest singers since Judy Garland.  She was amazing.  We've lost her.  And now is the time you want to hear her sing God Bless America.  Not Celine Dion.  Remember the call?  Punching her.  Pacemaker to hit the note.  I love Celine.  She should sing any time she wants.  Canadian.  I want an American.  Canadian.  At the end of that show, I want an American.  I'm sorry. 
[01:40:30]  I'm sorry to sound like a Republican.  I'm sorry.  She's singing God Bless America, My Home Sweet Home.  It's like, no.  Good.  No, no.  Canada.  Bonjour.  Je t'ai un peu bon.  No, no, no.  Great people.  Pick me up.  Andrew, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Michael Jetson, Rat Pack.  You got Amal and Brando, Liz Taylor, Macaulay, Calkin, Liza.  Yeah.  It's like the island of Dr. Moreau.  They're all freaks.  It's the island of misfit toys is what it is.  They're all freaks.  Nobody wants a Charlie in the box. 
[01:41:00]  Rudolph, let go of my key.  You're cranking it too hard.  Rudolph, oh, you have to go see King Moonraiser.  And that's not the only thing he raises.  That's great.  Oh, I love those.  The Rankin Bass specials.  I live with them.  Rankin Bass.  Oh, my God.  The best one is the little drummer boy where they kill his parents, and he is a miserable  boy.  It's so depressing and brilliant.  They wouldn't do something like that now.  No.  They don't show it on network television anymore.  No.  You know why?  Because they said that it's racist because they portray Arabs as terrorists. 
[01:41:30]  Hey.  I think that'll be back on network television this year, don't you?  If the bomb fits.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Smell it.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  Remember a show.  It was The Littlest Angel.  Johnny Whitaker.  I sure do.  Johnny Whitaker.  They would never show that again.  It was a horrible little thing.  And they never showed it.  It was about a kid becoming an angel in heaven, and he dies at the beginning of it.  It's a little kid.  He's chasing a butterfly.  He falls off a cliff. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  He falls off a cliff.  He does.  And then he goes to heaven.  His mother is there crying, finding out that her kid just died, and the kid comes back  as an angel, and he's trying to talk to his mother, and he's crying, and she's crying  because he's dead.  He's crying because he can't talk to her because he's dead now.  It was all about death.  It's completely dead.  And so is the drum boy.  It's the same thing.  It's all about death and being alone.  Even at the end when the drum boy finally sees Jesus, he's still pissed.  He's like, I have no gift to bring.  He's just dead.  You know?  Okay, I have no gift.  What do you want from me, Jesus? 
[01:42:30]  Make my lamb live.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, God.  Rent that.  If any of you out here have never seen the little drum boy, buy it.  You make our job so easy.  You know what?  You make our job easy, too.  Mario Cantone is playing Caroline's all this weekend, Friday through Sunday.  We tell you every time, go see Mario.  Two shows Friday, two shows Saturday, and one show on Sunday.  Tickets go fast now for Mario and Caroline, so you might want to call them ahead of time,  okay?  Yeah, I saw him last time he was here.  How long ago was that now?  It was the last show I did that Sunday, about two weeks ago, right? 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Very, very funny.  We did a little Judy Garland.  For all the straight boys in the crowd, because I know they love Judy.  Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.  Ever see her sing the battle hymn over the Republic?  No.  Watch it now.  It's devastating.  I can't see any Judy Garland now.  I don't know where you go to get that.  You've got to go get the box set on the DVD.  I don't know where you're going to get that.  There's a new DVD coming out called Just Judy. 
[01:43:30]  How do you know this stuff?  Because I know it all.  I am the great nomadessment.  See, this is the difference.  I know there's a Simpsons DVD coming out.  You know there's a Judy Garland DVD coming out.  I know.  I know.  I get them in advance from my friend Scott Schechter.  I'm like, give me that in advance.  I want them two weeks in advance.  I met them in Grand Central.  Like, give me the drowns.  We're missing out.  Judy Garland DVDs.  And there's another cut she sings.  I happen to like New York.  Those are two cuts, I think, that are very relevant for today. 
[01:44:00]  More coffee?  Like, I need more coffee.  I'm going to go through the window.  Joe, what's up?  Joe.  We like our guest juiced up.  Little Joe.  Go ahead, Joe.  Hey, I want to hear Mario do his impression of Billy Corrigan smoking a bong.  Billy Corrigan.  Wasn't that the Cartman doing that?  It was Cartman doing that.  Yeah, we'll play that another day.  We'll play it.  Billy Corrigan, man.  I don't ever think I have.  From the Smashing Pumpkins doing that?  Don't you hear the resemblance?  Really?  Oh, you mean between Cartman and Billy Corrigan?  Yeah.  Yeah, maybe just a little bit, you know.  I think you're insane. 
[01:44:30]  I hate Billy Corrigan.  I don't even know who Billy Corrigan is.  How about that?  I don't even know who Billy Corrigan is.  Ah, see that?  How about that one?  Smashing Pumpkins.  The shaved head guy.  He is.  He's a shaved head guy.  You know, the white boy music.  You know, I'm not good at it.  You know, give me Eric Benet, who's married to Hit and Run Halley.  I love him.  Hit and Run Halley.  Actually, I'm only kidding.  I love Halley Berry.  I think she's a beautiful and wonderful actress.  John, what's up?  Hey, ONA.  How are you guys doing?  We're having fun, man.  Good.  Hey, I've got to say, you guys are geniuses.  Whose idea was to have Mario come on your show? 
[01:45:00]  I mean, he just doesn't fit in with any of the other comics.  I mean, the guy's great.  Hey, man.  Funny's funny.  Oh, I know.  Mario's great.  I mean, it just doesn't fit in with any of what?  We have our little comedy club here.  It's called juxtaposition.  It's called brilliant juxtaposition.  I don't know.  We have open minds these days.  I don't know.  No, no.  It has to be...  No, but I think he's saying that it's a great thing.  Yeah, okay.  He did use the word geniuses.  I congratulate you guys.  I mean, I'll tell you how it happened. 
[01:45:30]  I went to see Mario a while ago.  I had no clue who he was.  I didn't watch Steam Pipeout.  I didn't know any of that crap.  And I just happened to be at Caroline's one night, saw him, and I came running back to  and going, holy S, I saw this guy at Caroline's.  He's out of his effing mind.  And he does all these...  I don't know, Mario can't tell.  He does all these impressions of women.  Yeah.  Right.  And we're like, we've got to get him on the show.  And then we just hit it off, man.  We're like friends with the guy now.  Yeah, that was great.  I mean, how many of your listeners would just, like, shut you guys off if you told them  that you're going to have an impersonator doing Julie Garland on your show? 
[01:46:00]  That's what's amazing.  Well, that's what's amazing.  To have these guys calling up.  Last time I got a phone call, you're Julie Garland.  You're so funny.  I can't believe it.  It's like, I'm in a time warp.  This is bizarre.  But it's great.  I transcend.  Yeah.  And you've got to see the guys and a lot of women, too.  A lot of couples that come to see me.  The chicks dig you, Mario.  The chicks dig me.  They do.  The girls can be so cute.  They're all talking about how cute Mario is.  Well, you know what?  I dig the ladies.  I think this is a good place to take a break as Mario gets more juice, though.  I am not alone. 
[01:46:30]  His head's going to explode.  Bottle my big scone.  Take a bite out to the toad.  The elephant man's big fat bone.  She is lunatic.  Oh, my God.  What we're going to do as we go to break here is play the O.J. prank call thing.  Okay.  It's unbelievable.  People are just downloading this like crazy.  Yeah, I haven't heard it.  It's so good.  We have a new friend, Kid Chris, from Sacramento.  He's on after us on the station we broadcast on at KXOA in Sacramento. 
[01:47:00]  He got O.J. Simpson's cell phone number a while back, and he kept calling him and calling  him and recording it.  It's just great stuff.  O.J.  O.J.  This is really O.J.  Are you serious?  This is really Kid Chris just messing with him.  It's a montage of all the calls he did, and it's on foundrymusic.com, our underground  website, F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  Foundrymusic.com.  He was calling him like every hour.  O.J. Simpson likes pawn boys.  Oh, great. 
[01:47:30]  Check this out.  Yeah.  Oh, Juice?  Yeah.  Yeah, what are you doing?  Who's this?  This is A.C.  Let's go kill somebody tonight.  Bye.  Juice?  Yeah, hello.  O.J.  Who's this?  It's Al Michaels.  My wife's been acting like a real bitch.  I was wondering if you could help me kill her.  What do you say, champ?  Do I know you? 
[01:48:00]  Hey.  Juice, it's Chris Rock.  It's me, Chris Rock, Juice.  What do you say, you and I go kill the Spice Girls?  Juice, every time I call you, I always be laughing.  Hello?  Juice, you're late.  We're supposed to go out and kill people tonight.  What's going on?  I really can't talk.  I'm at dinner with a bunch of people, and I have no idea who you are.  I'm the real killer. 
[01:48:30]  O.J.  Hello?  Yeah.  Yeah, Juice.  Juice.  Juice, what's up?  Who is it?  It's Dan Dierdorf.  You want to go throw the ball around, you know, have some beers, maybe kill somebody?  Yeah.  Hi, O.J., it's Kato.  Well, I want to go pick up some young girls and kill them. 
[01:49:00]  We can hold them underwater or something.  How'd I go?  Can I move in with you?  Hello?  Hi, O.J.  Hey.  Hey, it's Marcus Allen.  Want to go get some bitches and kill them?  Yeah.  Gone.  Gone.  Ball.  Ball.  Come on.  Ball.  Ball.  Come on.  Ball.  Ball.  Come on.  That was a clip from Anthony, the retarded half of the O.B. & Anthony show. 
[01:49:30]  Don't go crazy, yo!  Ah, we're back. It's the O.B. and Anthony Show in studio.  You know, we oversay this, but it's really true with Mario.  One of our faves. Hell yeah.  Mario Cantone, he's playing Carolines all this weekend, starting tomorrow night, Friday through Sunday.  Call Carolines, man. It's becoming a hot ticket in New York City to see Mario.  Alright?  It's special. 
[01:50:00]  And everyone has a story about this disaster that happened 1.9 miles to my right, Anthony.  1.9 miles now.  Just following the equation from yesterday.  Whoever you talk to in the city has a story.  You go from sad to angry, sad to angry.  I'm just ridiculously pissed.  I usually spend the top of the show just ranting about how pissed I am.  Ranting about the latest.  Not only about what happened, but then how it's being handled by certain people. 
[01:50:30]  And I just get pissed.  I just tipped, so.  I know.  Piss.  Me too.  And there's nothing you can do about it. Thank you.  Do you like the tribute songs that all the other radio stations are playing?  I haven't heard a lot of them.  Why?  You know what it is?  They get the sad song.  They'll get, like, I will remember you.  And then they got to, yeah, that's not sad enough during this whole time.  They got to put news clips in of people's comments on how they lost people and how they found out about this. 
[01:51:00]  I don't know why you'd want to feel sadder.  The event already makes you sadder than you've ever been in your life.  And then there are people out there with these tribute songs trying to make you sadder.  I have to tell you, I mean, I cry every day anyway.  So this is, I don't cry every day, but I've been crying every day since this.  It's been, and I, it's just brutal.  And I haven't been down there yet.  And I have to go down there.  I feel like I have to go down there.  And then thinks I'm crazy.  I'm like, I have to go down there.  I've got to go down there and see it. 
[01:51:30]  I don't want to ever forget this.  Nah, you can't go down there.  I have no, I have no want to go down there.  You don't want to go down there?  No.  I think everybody, like I said, I think everybody needs to do, if people want to get on with their lives right away, they should.  If they want to take a little time, I think they're allowed to.  I think everybody needs to, everybody, it's an individual thing.  You have to, you have to be like, when is it, you know, when is it right to go to a comedy club and laugh?  You want to come and laugh?  Come on, man.  And I'll do my job and I'll make you laugh.  If you don't want to come, don't.  It's okay.  We're calling this show a distraction. 
[01:52:00]  And not only is this radio a distraction, going to a comedy club.  Like, going to see you this weekend should be a distraction.  It takes your mind off a little bit.  I think it's okay.  That's right.  You know what?  I got, what this did also is, I did Rosie O'Donnell's show a week after this happened.  And I was like, I would never say no, but it was, I had to go on and be funny and sit down with her and be funny.  Yeah, and it was like a week after.  I was shaking.  I was so horrified.  And it went very well.  And Rosie was so gracious and she just gave me the floor and just let me do what I do. 
[01:52:30]  And then I just thanked her for letting me come on and hope that we, you know, could forget for a few minutes.  That's all I really said about the situation.  But it was, it was, it was, it was just, and I walked down the street afterwards and so many people came up and said, I just saw you on Rosie.  You made me laugh for the first time in a week.  There was a sign in my building saying, Mario, thank you for making me laugh for the first time in a week.  I mean, I got lots of emails and so I, because as a comedian, you don't really know what you do.  You don't know, you just do it. 
[01:53:00]  You don't have, you don't know the effect.  Yeah, you have no clue.  People come to your show miserable, upset, whether this is going on or not.  And, and you're helping someone laugh.  Laugh, laughter is, it sounds corny, but it's, I got that it's healing.  And I never really kind of got that before.  It's like, I'm just doing this.  I don't know about my effect.  But there I am with all these people on the street coming up to me and I'm like crying in their face like Tammy Faye Cantone.  I was like, okay, calm down.  Calm down, Tammy.  I was like, Jim was really, he was innocent.  He really was.  I love you, Jesus. 
[01:53:30]  I was like, he really, really, really does.  No more interviews with your shirt off in Times Square by Caroline?  I did not have my shirt off.  We haven't talked to him since, have we?  No, on the phone.  No, on the phone we did.  Oh, on the phone we did real quick.  You called me on the phone.  I had a beige Kenneth Cole sweater on and you thought I was going to.  It was a sweater?  Yeah.  Because I was sitting at home.  Did it make you hot?  Did it make you hot at the knee?  Oh, yes, the shirtless Mario.  Yes.  I hear Mario Cantone from out in front of Caroline's talking about how it's affecting comedy clubs and Caroline's 
[01:54:00]  and how it's affecting...  It's affecting everything.  So, I turn around and I go, oh, I turn to look at the TV and I go, Mario's not wearing  a shirt.  I go, Mario's not wearing a shirt.  Why is Mario walking around Manhattan?  I was unshaving, too.  He's so distraught, he's just walking around Manhattan naked.  Did I say, Mario, you looked rugged because you were unshaving?  I did look rugged.  Mario looking rugged.  I had about a four-day growth and I had a shirt, a beige... 
[01:54:30]  It was a beige...  I had a bodysuit on.  It's one of those things I wore in Equus when I did it in high school.  They wouldn't let me take off my clothes, so I had a bodysuit on.  I learned something.  Mario could look rugged.  Is it a leotard?  It's a bodysuit.  It's a bodysuit?  It's a very kind of fussy bodysuit.  Fussy.  It's very fussy.  I didn't realize it was this way because I was kind of across the room, so I looked  at the TV from a distance and an angle, I guess.  But I thought you were walking around Manhattan.  For some reason, this disaster made you just tear your clothes off and walk around Manhattan. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Who would blame you, though?  I thought you lost your mind.  Unshaven, like you were Mariah.  You just lost your mind, ripped your clothes off, and went outside.  I was in the kitchen with my mother breaking dishes.  My movie sucks!  My single didn't reach number one!  What's wrong with me?  Really significant now, huh, Mariah?  Yeah, they were interviewing her about her performance at the tele-a-thon.  Well, she came out.  She did.  But you know what it is now? 
[01:55:30]  They're asking her, how are you feeling?  What's going on?  Yeah, how is she feeling?  And her answer is, it's not the right time to discuss that.  I think now we're here to help out people that need it, so she's deflecting it.  But it's in a good way.  What the hell?  Can you know you can, sir?  Take it!  Take the note, choir!  Hey, Neil, what's going on?  Yeah, I just want to know if Mario saw Eliza sing New York, New York at the Mets game?  Because I felt gay watching it. 
[01:56:00]  You were gay for about two minutes.  Later, fellas.  Yeah, I did see it.  I did see it.  And, you know, she's...  I have to go out and sing New York, New York everywhere I can.  It's important.  I've got to sing it.  Okay, the New York, New York, can't you have fun?  No, that's not it.  The New York, New York...  But I'm going to sing it.  But I need a jelly donut.  Can I get me a jelly donut?  Yeah, I did see it.  She starts spreading the... 
[01:56:30]  I'm leaving today.  I want to be a part of it.  New York, New York.  Yeah, she was great, though.  They put the hat on her, and she was, like, so cute.  She looked great.  You know what?  She's out there doing it, and good for her.  Good for her.  And she's...  I love Liza Minnelli.  I know I goof on her, and I'm brutal to her, but I think she's brilliant, and I think she's 
[01:57:00]  talented, and she's out there doing it.  Did you ever meet her?  Oh, yeah.  I've had dinner with her.  You've had dinner with her?  She's made me dinner at her house.  Get out of town.  Oh, yeah.  And this is a person that you...  You rag on.  I'm brutal.  He lives such a different life than you and I.  I'm trying.  Dinner Liza.  Dinner Liza.  I was being managed by her manager, but I actually got friendly with her through Fred  Ebb of Kander and Ebb, who wrote Cabaret in Chicago and New York, New York. 
[01:57:30]  And Fred is a good friend, and I love him to death.  And that's how I...  So I was at his place making him dinner, and she came over, and he said...  How did she come over?  Did she just knock on the door, open up, and you're like...  She's like, hi, Cookie.  She gave me a kiss, and she looked so cute.  She had a little weight on her, a little face, a little Italian round face.  She looked like a little cousine, you know.  And she sat down, and Fred said, do her for her.  Do her for her.  I was like, what?  Just do her.  Just do her.  I was like, I put her on the table, and I powder.  So she said, come on, do it. 
[01:58:00]  So I said, she goes, what do you do?  I said, I do you forgetting the words in Victor Victoria, the jazz hot song.  She goes, just do it.  And I did it, and she...  When you play me the jazz hot, baby, it's so weird, it's so weird, it's so weird.  And she was hysterical laughing.  And then one time I did this, my lawyer's birthday party.  It was this big show with Mark Sandroff, and Liza was there, and I was ready to do her,  and she was like, you hear from the audience, please be kind. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, no.  And I was like, don't worry, you know I do you.  But, you know.  Please be kind.  Please be kind.  I was like, I will, I promise you.  Hey, Ed, what's up?  Hey, Mario, I got a question for you.  Go ahead, Eddie.  I'm no expert on Liza, but did she stroke out?  When?  Did she have a stroke?  Because the side of her face looks a little dead.  No, she didn't.  No, I don't think she had a stroke, but she just strokes like this.  Yeah, she's always had that lip thing.  It's not a stroke.  It's just something that, I don't know what it is.  It's just a lazy ass.  Her mother had it a little bit, too, but not as bad. 
[01:59:00]  Her mother was more like that.  But if you look at Liza in her early career, she didn't really have it as much.  But now she's like, no, she didn't have a stroke.  She's healthy and doing great, and she's losing weight, and she's, you know, friends with Michael Jackson.  What can I tell you?  Hey, we were speaking of tribute songs and songs about the tragedy.  Yeah.  We have one.  What is it?  Is it a new one?  Yeah, it's called The Taliban Can.  No way.  As in The Candyman Can. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, as in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory?  This is from David Silver.  Wait, wait, wait.  We went from tribute songs to now, are they starting to goof on this thing a little bit?  They're doing parody songs, I guess.  The Taliban Can?  The Taliban Can.  What is it from, like, Osama bin Laden and the Skidmark Factory?  What is this from?  I don't know.  It's a guy named David Silver.  All right.  You want to listen to a little bit of it?  Okay.  Okay.  Taliban. 
[02:00:00]  Taliban.  Taliban.  Ahmed.  Abdul.  Come.  It is time to make sushi hands.  Wait, wait.  What is that noise?  We're taking the Americans.  Who can take some towels?  Who can take some towels?  Wrap them around their heads.  Wrap them around their heads.  Harbour some gorillas, thumb their noses at the feds.  The Taliban.  Oh, the Taliban. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, the Taliban can.  The Taliban can.  The Taliban can.  Cause they like to help bin Laden make the world go boom.  Make the world go boom.  Who can grab Osama?  Who can grab Osama?  Catch him in a sting.  Catch him in a sting.  Slap him into handcuffs, beat his ass like Rodney King.  The Taliban.  The Taliban.  Oh, the Taliban can.  Uh-oh.  J.P. Morgan's heading toward the gong.  The Taliban can. 
[02:01:00]  Cause they like to help run the world go boom.  Oh, look at that.  No, Jamie Farr's holding back the big gong thing.  Will she be able to gong there?  Cause they think we're not religious.  And look, Artie Johnson's hiding in the bushes like the German character from Laugh-In.  We may have to blow their bridges.  Ah, give it the gong.  It doesn't make sense.  When we're done with Kabul.  When we're done with Kabul.  Iran has been defiled.  Iran has been defiled. 
[02:01:30]  Qaddafi, Yasser, Idi Amin, and his crocodile.  They're all gonna pay.  They're all gonna pay.  Yeah, Bush will make them pay.  They're all gonna pay.  Bush will make them pay.  Cause he's got 40 billion bucks to make the world feel good.  Make the world feel good.  All right.  I don't get it.  I did not appreciate that at all.  The Taliban can?  No.  It is not correct at all.  Yeah, how come they're talking about Bin Laden and how the Taliban could lock him up, but 
[02:02:00]  they're pals with each other.  It just didn't make sense.  It makes no sense.  It made no sense.  Well, good afternoon.  The Taliban can.  The Taliban can.  In America.  They're coming to America.  Cracklin' Rosie, get on board.  Cause the Taliban can.  Neil Diamond's been popping in every so often for the past couple of weeks.  Neil Diamond pops in for no apparent reason. 
[02:02:30]  Hey, Tim, what's up?  Yo, how you doing?  Pretty good.  I was wondering, since Mario doesn't use his tool, I wonder if he could hook up with those  penis puppeteer guys.  Since he doesn't use his tool?  Use my tool?  I use my tool.  He uses his tool just in a different way.  I just don't use it.  The puppet penis.  I've heard about the puppet penis.  Oh, my God.  You've heard of the penis puppeteers from Australia?  I'll be careful how I say this, but we love the guys.  Hey.  Easy.  At first, we were...  Wait, they were here?  Yeah.  They came in here.  Let me walk you through it. 
[02:03:00]  Rick tells us guys are going to come in, they're going to drop their pants, and then  they're going to do do do do do do with their junk and make things out of it, okay?  So they make things out of their genitals.  Yeah.  So, Ant and I, I'll be honest, we're like, this is too gay.  Like, this is going to be a rough one, because we're a guy show, it's kind of rough, you  know, guys love when we have the girls in here, we love when we have the girls in here.  Just allowing you to get into a straight guy's head here.  So we're thinking...  Believe me.  We're starting to get homophobic and all that, like, I don't know if I can handle this.  I'm being honest with you.  I love it.  Go ahead.  Let me tell you, by the end of their segment, we were laughing so freaking hard, we didn't 
[02:03:30]  even care anymore.  I have to go see it.  I heard it's really funny.  It's at the Houseman's Theater or something?  Yeah.  But when they make...  The hamburger is so freaking funny.  The hamburger is ridiculous.  What they do is they take...  It seems like their main part of their junk has been stretched, because they're, like,  making things out of it for so many years that it was...  They're able to wrap it around more than once.  Let's just put it that way.  So he wrapped...  The one guy wrapped it around his finger. 
[02:04:00]  So they have a good size there.  Yeah, but it seems to...  Yeah.  Well, he can make the human thong...  Let's just say it's a lot more pliable.  Yeah, they made the thong, where he pulled it around back and pulled it all the way up  where it was the whole length of his butt crack.  On my ass!  Yeah.  Then the hamburger.  They wrap it around their finger, put one part of their yam bag on one side, the other  part on the other, and turn the whole package sideways. 
[02:04:30]  Anyways, and it looks like the yam bag part is the bun, and the curled up main part is  the meat, if you can say that.  I've got to get good seats for this.  I mean, you've got to get good seats for this.  If you're in the back of the house...  Well, they also have cameras on it and a big screen.  Oh, they do.  Yeah, they have projection.  Yes, and PenaVision.  PenaVision, they call it.  The jumbo swan.  Then they made a snail, the Loch Ness Monster.  Loch Ness Monster.  The Wind Surfer.  The Wind Surfer is disturbing. 
[02:05:00]  He takes the skin down there of the yam bag, pulls it, so it looks like a big sail, and  then grabs the other part and starts turning it like a sailboard thing.  Wow.  Well, walk, don't run.  I'll be there.  It's ridiculous.  And then the hungry bird in.  The hungry baby bird.  He can pull the skin all the way up that's around it, and pulls it tight up, and works  the front like a baby bird mouth, and goes, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep. 
[02:05:30]  Okay.  I've had enough of the puppetry of the penis.  And they're white guys, which is fascinating.  Yeah, they're Australians.  Oh, they're Australians.  Yeah.  Oh.  Melissa, what's going on?  Hello.  Hey.  Melissa.  Hi, honey.  Hi, Melissa.  Hi, Mario.  Hello, Melissa.  Hi, honey.  Hi, honey.  We're going to come and see you on Saturday.  You are?  We cannot wait.  Okay.  My cousin and I are coming from Jersey.  Oh, very good.  Have you ever seen him?  No, never.  Oh.  We love Sex and the City, and we watch him every time he was on, even though he was on 
[02:06:00]  a couple times.  But we want you to come back, we hope.  We do a little something.  I'll be back on January 13th.  This is my second episode.  Yeah.  I'll be repeating the season premiere right after Band of Brothers.  And I'm doing more next year.  Oh, good.  That's been pretty great.  Melissa.  You'll hear us.  We'll be screaming in the crowd for you.  You're like Joan Rivers' daughter.  Melissa, can you hear me?  You're going to do it for me, honey.  You're going to do it for me, honey.  Allegro.  You're going to do it.  Allegro.  All right, Mario.  Love you.  I love you.  Bye.  Thank you, sweetheart.  Bye.  Oh, baby.  I could have them all.  These chicks dig me.  You know what? 
[02:06:30]  I really like them.  Mario Cantone's going to be at Caroline's.  I'm not going to just act that way.  Friday through Sunday, you should call Caroline's for tickets.  They're going to go fast this time around.  Just to recover from some of the conversation we've had, I've had to pop up the Tara  Reid website and just look at scantily clad pictures of the  beautiful Tara Reid.  They have to infuse themselves.  I have to.  T and A.  I have to.  That's okay.  I know.  Look at this.  Sweet.  What's her name?  Tara Reid.  Tara Reid.  From American Pie?  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, yeah.  She's a beautiful woman.  When she's getting orally satisfied in that movie?  No.  Yeah.  Nice.  I haven't seen the director's cut.  The unedited version of that.  There's more to that scene.  Is there more to that scene?  On the DVD.  In the second one, American Pie 2, American Pie 1.  I haven't seen American Pie 2.  It's so funny.  I'm like the only one.  Yes, so.  And I didn't think I was going to.  I liked it better than the first one.  I thought it was really, really funny.  Yeah.  Very funny.  And I wish that woman was in it more.  The one that plays Stifler's mother.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She was in Legally Blonde.  She was so funny and so heartbreaking, too. 
[02:07:30]  Brilliant.  She's something else.  I don't even know her name.  Legally Blonde.  Another movie I've never seen.  Very good.  Very funny.  She's so talented, that Reese Witherspoon.  Very talented.  A talent and a delight.  All right.  Yeah, we can play that.  What are we playing?  You're sticking around, right?  Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.  Of course.  Where am I going to go?  I got nothing to go.  I got no place else to go.  I got no place else to go.  Don't you do that.  Don't you do that.  I got no place else to go. 
[02:08:00]  I got nothing.  There you go.  That's all right.  All right.  That's the best scene, Officer and a Gentleman.  It's a great scene.  Hey, we got a little something-something as we go to break here.  I love that Deborah Winger, too.  Mom, I'm kidding.  Mom.  Mom.  I love her in terms of a damn, and I cry.  Mom, I'm kidding.  Why do you hate Flip, Mom?  Why do you hate him?  Mom.  And then, like, Shirley MacLaine's like, don't call me a grandmother. 
[02:08:30]  Mom, you're a grandma.  I just accept a grandma.  Who the F does Deborah Winger?  Only I do.  Betty Davis loved Deborah Winger.  She was quite a talent, you know, Deborah Winger.  They say she's difficult.  They say that on all great actresses.  I am not difficult.  I was a professional.  Joan Crawford had a different set of breasts every day.  It was like bumping into the Hollywood Hills.  Joan Crawford was horrible, evil, a terrible woman. 
[02:09:00]  She really, really, really was.  Every day she would say, bless you, to the crew.  Bless you.  Bless you.  I would come in and say, is bless you arrived yet?  Where the hell is, bless you?  She hated that.  That was a great little Hollywood battle, yeah.  It was a great Hollywood battle.  All right.  More with Mario Cantone.  Check this little ditty out here.  Sweet.  You know, I just don't get this time, man. 
[02:09:30]  I turn on the MTV and I see, like, D'Angelo looking all cool.  He's got his shirt off and stuff and all the girls be liking it.  How do I do that?  I don't know how to do it.  How can I be cool?  I know why I'm not cool.  I can tell you why I'm not cool.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Come on, come on, come on.  I don't have a car that goes boom, because I'm too white.  You're way too white, dog.  Way too white.  Come on, come on.  I wear cheap-ass shoes, because I'm too white.

You want to know why?  Oh, why is that?  Hey, hey.  He banged a white.  Oh, ho, ho.

Well, yeah, I'm just going to do a little run there, just to do it.  Caroline's on Broadway.  Hey, a couple of stories that have hit the news.  You know, any news has been about the World Trade Center and Pentagon terrorist bombing, 
[02:13:00]  whatever the hell you want to call it.  But Santa Clara, California.  Lonnie O'Grady, who played Dick Van Patten's oldest daughter.  Oh, that's right.  And the 70s TV show, 8 is enough.  Dead.  Dead.  At 46.  Dead.  46?  She found her in her...  She's dead.  Found dead in her mobile home by a neighbor.  Oh, come on.  She lived in a mobile home?  Mobile home, 46, dead.  After the show, O'Grady drifted away from acting and went to what? 
[02:13:30]  That got her in a mobile home at 46 years old.  Why the mobile home?  Why?  Dead.  And it's no secret she had a lot of problems with drugs.  After the show.  With the dope.  Well, everybody on that show was on the dope.  I think even Dick Van Patten was a snorting coke.  One of the best true Hollywood stories.  Yeah.  Which was one.  Which was...  8 is enough.  8 is enough.  A bunch of little druggies.  Even a little one.  Even a little one.  Do you know, I lived in a mobile home.  In 1973, my mother wanted to redecorate the house and she didn't have the money, so she burnt 
[02:14:00]  it down.  And, yeah, she did.  She burnt the house down.  I'm not kidding.  Well, she's dead now, so she can't...  Wait, wait.  You didn't know that?  You can't just blow off that part of it.  Oh, yeah.  You got to explain.  She burnt down the house.  She had the house burnt so she could get the insurance money to...  Okay.  Were you one of those families that had the trailer on the front lawn in front of the  burnt house?  In the back.  I've seen that, right?  We had the big...  She rented a mobile home and we stayed in it.  It was like, hi, everybody.  We all had, like, southern accents for a while.  It was so weird. 
[02:14:30]  It was like...  And we had, like, a silver Christmas tree with red balls.  I mean, it was, like, so bizarre.  I was in a mobile home.  Were you able to build the house the way she wanted?  With the insurance money?  She hired this guy named Mikey, whose reputation was he never finished a job.  And she was like, he'll finish a job for me.  He'll do it for me.  I'm like, well, he's not going to...  I was one job.  He'll finish it for me.  He never finished the job.  Oh, boy.  Three quarters of it.  And then she finished it.  She did.  Staining furniture and... 
[02:15:00]  She did it.  And grouting tile.  And, yeah, I was like, my, you're a lesbian.  What's going on?  You're, like, butching it up and finishing the house.  You had a tool kit on her waist.  A tool belt.  And then she was, like, booking numbers at the same time.  She was unbelievable.  She was a jack of all trades, let me tell you.  Bookie housewife and carpenter.  My dad made cars go away.  Oh.  My dad made cars disappear.  Sure.  Yeah.  The family car.  My mother got insurance on a car that was stolen that never existed.  Oh, wow.  How about that one?  That's a talent.  That is good. 
[02:15:30]  That's a talent.  That's an amazing thing.  My dad would get rid of cars like he got rid of your pets when they got old.  You know, remember that day when the awesome dad would take the pet and come home without the pet?  Yeah, I know.  He would do that with cars in my family.  My mother did it with dogs and cars.  My mother would take my dogs for a ride.  She called it a ride.  A ride.  You would never see the dog again.  She was like a hitman for all the animals in my family.  And then she would lie and be like, well, where's Smokey?  He was in the backyard.  I don't know.  He must have ran away in a thunderstorm.  I didn't see him.  What?  We all have one of those stories. 
[02:16:00]  And then when she died, we all found out the truth.  But here's the dog.  She sold it to a family who lived on a farm in Spencer, Massachusetts.  Am I going to see it?  No, sorry.  He's frolicking and free, but he's not yours anymore.  Oh, man.  We found out all the secrets.  But she was just...  That was doggy heaven.  She was intense, my mother.  Those dogs were like, bye.  Bye.  See you later.  The last one was saved because she died in 81.  May she rest in peace.  But the dog, the last dog she got from my brother, well, he finally died because he was like  arthritis in his ass. 
[02:16:30]  And I used to call him, hey, little arthritic ass.  He was cute.  He was a Keishan.  A Keishan.  But just skated under the wire.  He did.  He got it.  He got it.  He would have been gone.  That's all he did was yap that dog.  And now I cannot get attached to dogs.  I don't want a dog or anything because they leave.  They go away.  They die.  It's like bad enough people die.  I cannot get emotionally attached to a dog.  You've got to get one of those Sony dogs, the ones that are mechanical.  Yeah.  The Disney audio animatronic.  Right. 
[02:17:00]  Arf.  Exactly.  Arf.  Arf.  What's wrong with that?  There you go.  It'll be your powerful life.  They don't pee at all.  What's that instant feedback there, Mario?  I got a little email from Aaron in Boston that says, oh, and a Mario is the greatest.  His sister is the best bartender at Ferrari's restaurant in Malden, Massachusetts.  My sister, Camille.  Oh.  She's kind of a cigarette smoking.  Yeah.  You use your sister, Camille, a lot in your ass.  Yeah.  I do.  She, she, I called her up when this whole thing happened.  She is so angry.  Yeah.  She is like, I'm like, what are we going to do?  She's like, I'm going to tell you what we're going to do.  I'll tell you what we do. 
[02:17:30]  Round them up.  Round them up and send them all back.  I don't mean to hurt them.  Round them up.  Round them up.  Oh, you're a nice one.  Too bad.  Get on the boat.  You're going back.  Oh, oh, yeah.  Oh, really?  You're a high priest?  Get on the boat.  Round them all up.  We're too paranoid.  No offense to anybody.  Round them up.  I'm sorry.  I don't mean to hurt you.  It's a gentle cruise.  You'll have drinks. 
[02:18:00]  Round them up.  I was like, okay, well, that's an interesting concept.  Holy Jesus.  Oh, she's a trip.  Round them up.  Round them up.  I like the idea.  There's something else in the news, Anthony.  Yeah.  Las Vegas, Nevada.  Quickly, before we even get to that one, I know which one you're going to.  You have another one?  Angelina Jolie has donated $1 million to the Afghan refugees.  Yeah.  Angelina Jolie, $1 million to help the refugee Afghans. 
[02:18:30]  What?  Angelina, did you notice there's a couple of things here broken, busted, that could use  a million bucks, that there are families of dead people that could really use?  You know, a lot of people said, oh, well, hey, look at this, they've raised half a billion  dollars so far, $500 million. 
[02:19:00]  If you divvy that up between everyone that's died, it works out to be like $75,000 a piece.  It's not really a lot, considering they're dead.  You know what I mean?  For everyone else involved.  A million bucks she gives to the Afghan refugees.  What?  Angelina, what?  Yeah, now's the time for that, Angelina.  What do you do?  Why do you do?  What is the...  Angelina Jolie!  So, there you go.  Is that a plunger on your face, or you just want to kiss me? 
[02:19:30]  Please get the Chapstick sponsor.  That's just amazing.  Angelina Jolie.  It's not only all the death and destruction.  There's so many people losing their jobs.  That could just really donate a million bucks.  I think the Afghans are probably the last people.  You should be giving them.  Not a good idea right now.  Right.  All right.  Well, and then this could...  Well, this could be the story of the day, Anthony.  What's going on now with your mic?  Our favorite fighters in the news again.  Las Vegas, Nevada.  Detectives have searched the million-dollar-plus Las Vegas estate of boxer Mike Tyson, 
[02:20:00]  taking away possible evidence.  More evidence.  After a woman accused a former world heavyweight champion of...  Of?  Of stealing her purse?  I'll give you three guesses.  Grabbing her chickens?  Stealing her car.  Thank you.  You guys have it.  Yes.  Accused the former world heavyweight champion of rape.  Again.  Again.  Tyson, who has not been charged in connection with the allegations,  was cooperative during the search.  Alligators? 
[02:20:30]  What did the alligators have to do with this?  Which was conducted on Wednesday at his 11,000-square-foot mansion  in the desert resort city?  Las Vegas police captain Dennis Cobb has said...  I could spell alligators.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  T-L-U-V-R.  Alligators.  Allegations.  What does that mean?  They've been levied against me.  They're all inaccurate.  First of all, I couldn't have perpetrated this crime. 
[02:21:00]  There's no way.  Perpetrated.  L-M-Z-Q.  No, no, no.  The number two and the sign for hydrogen.  No, it starts with a P, Mike.  P-L-U-Z-Q.  Alligators.  Oh, I was on perpetrator.  Alligators.  Alligators.  I could not have done that because I was hibernating.  You know how Mike Tyson lives. 
[02:21:30]  I burrow myself in a hole and I sleep until the weather gets warm again.  So the police had to question me.  You know what they did?  They woke Mike up.  They crawled into my hole with a big stick and a needle at the end  and they sedated me a little and then pulled me out.  Is that why you're a little lethargic?  I'm just a tad lethargic.  How do we spell that?  L-T-O.  And there's a can of tuna and a Y. 
[02:22:00]  L-L-T-H-A-N-G.  I'm afraid to say anything about him because he will kick.  He will kill me.  When are you ever going to see him?  We said the other day.  I see him once in my neighborhood.  He goes to Negril, this restaurant, right on 23rd and 9th.  Wait, he lives in New York?  He's in New York a lot?  I've seen him there a few times.  Uh-oh.  And I went by and scared.  He will take me, beat me, and probably he will.  We suggested that we send him over to Afghanistan.  He'll find bin Laden and he'll drag him out of that cave by his nutsack.  That's a good idea.  Drop the mic bomb. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  You just take me off the Zoloft and set me loose.  I'll fight his ear off and sexually assault him.  Finally, I'll put my evil powers to good use.  Chris makes a good point.  Chris?  Hey.  Go ahead, Chris.  I just wonder what's up with all these women that are still hanging out with Tyson.  What are they doing going back to his house?  Yeah, that's another thing.  Any woman that would go with him alone is kind of silly.  Yeah.  You know?  And then I think a lot of them, you know, and I hate to say this because it's one of those 
[02:23:00]  things and say, hey, it's your fault.  It's the girl's fault.  But, you know, with Mike, what are you going to do?  It's like wearing a chopped meat suit and getting into a lion cage.  Well.  You know?  What the hell's going to happen to me?  Well, OJ still has girlfriends, too.  Oh, OJ's got the blondes that look just like the girl he killed.  I know.  I mean, I don't know what's wrong with them.  They love it.  They like a bad boy.  They like the danger there, Marion.  I like the thug boy.  There's a lot of things, Jim.  But, you know, give me your criminal record for us and let me check it out. 
[02:23:30]  Jenny.  I got some audio from my last day.  Hi.  Yeah.  I tried to call earlier when you had the guy from WWF on.  I'm sorry.  I'm not too up on my WWF.  Al Snow.  Al Snow.  Yeah.  But I just wanted to tell you guys that thank you so much during that.  I love the Mike Tyson impression.  You want to go out with Mike?  I'm almost done with the police.  All they have to do is measure me and measure my teeth and put a tag in my ear and a radio collar on me.  I thought they did that already when you, um, with the girl in Florida, though. 
[02:24:00]  I rubbed it on a tree and dislodged it.  The radio collar.  That's why they had trouble finding me throwing these alligators.  We can track you on the Internet now, Mike.  Oh, that's the problem.  It's so weird.  When I came up to the house and the police were there, they were pouring plaster of Paris in my footprints and selling them at the souvenir shop down the road.  Why'd they call me Sasquatch? 
[02:24:30]  You know, there's something really poignant to say, but I completely forgot it because I'm laughing so hard.  I got audio from my last date.  Thank you.  I'll call you Cab.  Thank you so much.  You can go home now.  Tell them Mike sent you.  I'm going to go finish getting dressed now.  I'm butt naked.  Oh, hey.  Hey now.  I never have to tell the cab driver a different address for all my girlfriends. 
[02:25:00]  I just go emergency room when I send them home.  Hey, pal, what's going on?  Pat.  Matt.  Matt, what's up?  Yeah, I just wanted to say, Opie, I love your Mike Tyson impression.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Yeah, Opie, Opie's doing that.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Mike.  No, I'm proud to say that Anthony is one of the best impressionists, and he does a great Mike Tyson.  You do a great Mike.  No, no, no.  Anthony.  He does a good Reagan.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[02:25:30]  We just found out that Mike spends a lot of time in New York.  Anthony does that great Tyson impression.  Last time I was in New York, I was climbing the Empire State Building, and biplanes were  shooting at me, and I had a screaming blonde in my hand.  Oh, yeah, I suppose he was a bullhorn for some stupid reason.  Why did Mike always talk through the bullhorn?  Why?  Because of the time he was in Europe.  I don't know.  Oh, that's right.  He was in Europe, and he had to talk to the crowd that was outside the hotel room. 
[02:26:00]  That was it.  He was in England right after he got out of prison, and the people in England were protesting  that he was there, and he grabbed the bullhorn and tried to calm the English crowd down.  There were thousands of people outside his hotel.  Hey, your women are whores.  Your lady died was a whore, and the queen is an old bitch.  I love your English women with the bad teeth, and now I will date one and punch her in the  vulva.  I'm on the Zoloft thing, right? 
[02:26:30]  But I'm on that to keep me from killing y'all.  Thank God for Zoloft.  Thank God for Zoloft is right.  What about Oscar de la Hoya?  I like the Oscar de la Hoya.  Oscar de la Hoya.  I love the Oscar de la Hoya.  I love his album.  It's riveting.  Have you seen, have you heard of that?  I couldn't spell Hoya today.  It was a crossword puzzle.  H-O-Y-O, right?  I don't know.  One, the love is the love is the love is the love.  There was an extra space there.  He puts the somber on.  Something was going on.  Yeah, I don't know.  Don't forget the La Hoya.  La, L.A.  You've heard his album? 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  You know, I knew it was coming before because he used to put on the sombrero and get the  mandolin and be like,  It was like, okay.  And then he's like, music is my passion.  It is something that I just really, it's not something my mother wanted me to do, my father  wanted me to do.  I wanted to do it myself.  And music is really my number one passion.  And I like to write music and just sing it like Ricky Martin.  Hey, Stacey's on the phone.  She's here.  Stacey.  Hey, what's up, dude?  You would date Mike Tyson? 
[02:27:30]  Would I date Mike Tyson?  Mike Tyson would have to get a charge from me.  Mike Tyson needs somebody like me.  I could handle his ass.  Oh, you think so, bitch?  Oh, I think so.  Come over here.  I'll slap you silly.  You ever see the size of my hand?  I could hold a whole blonde in it and climb the Empire State Building.  Just bring it, baby.  Just bring it.  Yeah, right, you bitch.  I'm off the Zoloft.  I'm off the Zoloft.  I'm off the Zoloft.  And you know what Zoloft is like?  Yeah, you need more Zoloft.  Chains and the King Kong movie on stage.  Chains equals Zoloft. 
[02:28:00]  And when I'm off it, I'm off the chains.  And before you know it, I'm eating subway cars.  She got scared.  Hey, we got to back up a few minutes because a bunch of people are calling about this.  Chuck?  Yeah, you just hung up on a naked chick without playing What's in My Pants.  Are you guys getting lazy or what?  No, we know what it is.  We're slowly but surely getting back to, you know, how we do this radio show.  Yeah, I know.  It's still a little early. 
[02:28:30]  It's still a little early.  How come it was okay for man meat, but it's too early for naked chick?  We got to get a naked girl in this.  You know something?  I think we're ready.  I think we're ready for the first naked girl back to the O&A show.  I was here that day with that girl that showed me her breasts.  Right.  I'm a newlywed.  And to be honest with you, I didn't have sex with my wife for the first three days after.  Chuck?  Three days after the thing, man.  I had to get back into it, man.  We have an idea, and we're just wondering if enough time has passed so we can do something like this without people getting... 
[02:29:00]  I don't even know how to explain this.  But we want to have some kind of contest where we have women show their patriotism.  Yeah.  Where they wear like, you know, the Stars and Stripes and stuff.  Bikinis and things like that.  Something like that just as an excuse to get naked women on the show.  Yeah.  But we just don't know if the time's right yet.  That's all.  Well, listen.  Whatever you do, it's always great, man.  You guys are really the best.  I listen to you guys every day.  Thank you, man.  I love you, man. 
[02:29:30]  Thanks, Chuck.  Have a great day, man.  This guy wants to defend Angelina Jolie.  For giving a million bucks to Afghans.  John?  Yeah.  Hey, go ahead.  I just wanted to say, you know, we say there's good Afghans in this country.  And the innocent ones are fleeing from over there because they know we're going to go over there and kick their ass.  Let's take care of the people at home first.  Don't matter.  That's part of war, my friend.  Two words.  Jane Fonda. 
[02:30:00]  There you go.  It's different.  Jane Fonda.  It's completely different.  Jane Fonda.  No, Jane Fonda said we were wrong for doing that.  All she's doing is helping out the people that we're displacing.  Displacing.  I'd like to displace them with bombs.  Why doesn't Angelina Jolie go over there and do some photo ops with the Taliban?  Yeah, maybe she could sit on an anti-aircraft gun.  Jane Fonda.  That's completely different.  We've got to take care of our own people first.  Yeah, I agree.  I think we're doing a good job of that.  Go down to ground zero, John, and then I think you'd be a little pissed off about this. 
[02:30:30]  Hey, I am pissed off about it.  Go to an airport.  See how many people aren't working.  Come on.  A million bucks.  Go to all the restaurants downtown and see all the empty restaurants.  Round them up!  Round them up!  Bus boys, I'm sorry.  Let's go.  Get on the boat.  So is that all the innocent people in Afghanistan's fault?  No, it's something we can't be bothered with right now is innocent people in Afghanistan.  How about innocent people that were killed two weeks ago? 
[02:31:00]  We're still trying to find body parts so people could bury their loved ones.  If you don't understand that, I don't know what to tell you.  I understand the innocent people over there in Afghanistan.  Sorry.  Can't worry about them right now.  Got to worry about our own asses being blown up.  Sorry.  Worry about home.  Sorry.  Well, sorry.  He hung up.  He's defending her.  Angelina Jolie.  I don't know if he was defending her.  He was trying to, you know, play devil's advocate.  Maybe that's it.  The devil's advocate.  Did Billy Bob Thornton, I hope he just took that big meaty hand of his and punched her 
[02:31:30]  right in the big fat lips.  I don't advocate wife beating, except in this situation.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, Mario, you're the best.  Thank you, Mike.  Loved you in Quiz Show, by the way.  Oh, gee, thanks.  My one scene.  Key roll.  Listen, no.  You were in Quiz Show?  No, wait.  You were in Quiz Show?  I had one scene.  I played a guy that harassed Ralph Fiennes at a phone booth and chased him down the street.  Get out of here.  I'm the one scene wonder, let me tell you.  Yeah.  Let's hear the line, Mario.  I'm sorry?  Let's hear the line, Mario. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, the line that I said there?  Yeah.  I was like, because, well, the premise was he was a quiz show whiz, and he was guessing all  these answers, and I was like, hey, Charles Van Duren.  Charles Van Duren.  Look, it's Charles Van Duren.  Hey, Chucky, answer this.  Answer this question.  What street do I live on in Brooklyn?  You don't know that, do you?  Huh, Chucky?  What are you doing?  Dialing 411 for information?  Look at these dialing 411 for information.  I remember that scene.  Give me an autograph.  Come on, Chuck.  Give me an autograph for my wife.  Come on, Chuck.  Don't be a snob.  Give me an autograph for my wife. 
[02:32:30]  And then it fades out.  I improvised most of that.  Robert Riffin was like, go ahead.  Just say what you want.  I was like, okay.  Look at that.  Maybe I'm a little late.  I want to know what would happen if Joan Crawford went on a date with Tyson.  Well, let's see.  What are you doing, Doc?  You know?  She has us laughing in the background.  Well, well, Miss Crawford, take off your shoes, Mike.  She's a bad mamma jamma.  I wouldn't amp with her.  You see what she did to little girls?  Imagine what she'd do to Mike.  I'd kick you square in the nuts with the big pottery barn plant pot. 
[02:33:00]  That's what I'd do.  And you'd have to clean behind it.  You scrub behind your scrotum and the wrinkles in the back of your neck.  Look at it.  It's all dirty.  This grime on the back of your neck, deep in the crevices, like a Thomas's English muffin.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  You clean up this mess. 
[02:33:30]  Strap yourself in.  Don't let her catch you.  Are you mocking me?  Are you making fun of me?  Michael!  No wire boxing gloves ever!  Michael, get out of that bed!  I buy you beautiful Everlast shorts and you put them on a wire hanger!  Get out of that bed! 
[02:34:00]  What do you call me?  Yes, Mommy, dear Liz.  When I wanted you to say that, I wanted you to mean it.  Get out of that bed!  Get out of that bed!  Get out of that bed!  Get out of that bed!  Get out of that bed!  What a great goddamn movie!  Oh, I agree.  I have it on Sweet TV game.  Hey, Tony's just so pissed off on the instant feedback, I will never ever J-O to Angelina Jolie again.  Good, good.  And neither will I.  Billy Bob, what are you doing?  What are you doing with that fist? 
[02:34:30]  I aim to kill you with it.  Giving money to the Afghanis, that ain't good.  I'm going to force-feed you French fried birdators so you're fat.  Patty!  Yeah?  What's up?  Nothing much.  I was following about Angelina Jolie.  Yes, Angelina Jolie.  Huh?  Angelina Jolie.  Yeah.  She's just like, what the hell?  Sorry! 
[02:35:00]  Hey, watch that F word!  She's like an F-ing something.  We all slipped once in a while, Patty.  Yes.  Me, Patty.  You got a potty mouth.  I also had another idea about who should do the cleanup down at Ground Zero.  Mm-hmm.  We should...  Hello?  Yes, yes.  We should, like, chain all these criminals that our tax money is going for.  Criminals.  You know, like, all these killers and stuff like that chain their butts together. 
[02:35:30]  You know what's going on at Ground Zero?  The cops and the firemen and the EMT and all that, they are down there digging because they  want to be the ones to take their brothers out of there.  Right.  They're actually, at this point, don't want any volunteers.  They're sending a lot of volunteers away from the Ground Zero area because the firemen  and the policemen especially want to take their brothers out of there.  Right.  And they will not leave until every single one of them is out of there or someone tells 
[02:36:00]  them, look, we're just not going to find them.  That is what's going on down there.  That's true.  I just figured, you know, if somebody's going to...  If we're going to pay for these people to sit in jail and do nothing and, you know,  like, maybe they should dig out some stuff, you know, but...  All I have to say is thank God for those guys.  All right, Patty.  Yeah.  Thanks.  You guys rock.  And she says, but Patty likes rock and roll. 
[02:36:30]  A hot dog makes her lose control.  What a lot of you had, because they're cousins, identical cousins all the way.  I love that show.  I want to, uh, one more about Jolie.  Jason, what's up?  Hello.  Jason.  Hello.  Hello.  Jason, turn on the radio.  That's a delay.  Yeah, shut off the radio.  What's up, guys?  Hi, Jason.  For future reference, anyone that calls the show, you've got to keep the radio down because  we're on a delay.  Right.  Screw you up.  All right, go ahead, Jason. 
[02:37:00]  I just wanted to say that you guys rock.  Since you got on the Cleveland market, everyone I know up here has been listening to you.  It's awesome.  I do wild stickers everywhere.  It's great.  We're going to try to get to Cleveland soon, bro.  Well, make sure everybody up here knows about it, because I'm sure I have a huge turnout.  No, you'll know, but did you have something on Jolie or no?  Yeah, I did.  They should strap her to the first bomb they drop on Afghanistan, because part of the reason  why Afghanistan's are fleeing there is because the Taliban has collected all the food rations 
[02:37:30]  and not given anything to the people over there.  Well, of course, you don't think aid is going to them already.  Aid is going to them already.  What they do in these lousy countries, we give them food and money and everything else  they need and the lousy governments they have in their place, and we've done this a lot  in Africa, to take the food and supplies and sell them and give the money to the head  muckety-mucks of the government.  So that's all that's going to happen there.  Until the Taliban's gone, those people are effed whether Angelina Jolie gives her a million 
[02:38:00]  dollars in there or not.  They're crooks.  We can't fathom the corruption of that level.  We can't feed it, though.  I think they should drop her on Afghanistan.  It was the first one we dropped.  All right, Jason, thank you.  Thank you.  Bye.  It's treason.  We'll wrap up the show next.  All right.  Mario Cantone playing Carolines all this weekend.  Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  Call Carolines.  Tickets are going fast.  Come on down.  And also tonight at the WWF, a bunch of us going down to check out Al Snow on the last episode  of Tough Enough. 
[02:38:30]  I'd like to do a guest spot with the WWF.  I want to wrestle.  Really?  Yeah, right.  Really?  I would run around that ring like Snoopy.  I'd be like, ah.  Yeah, those guys are a real deal, too.  They hurt each other, even though it's still script and everything.  They hurt each other.  They must get hurt, even though it's a play.  It's theater, in a way.  These guys get hurt.  They take bumps.  They must get hurt.  They take bumps.  Big time.  Taking bumps.  They're very big boys.  All right, we'll play What Do We Learn Next.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:39:00]  What do you think this show is?  It's a mix between curious amusement and outright horror.  It's absolutely disgusting.  It's awful.  Silk and smash.  It's really bad, but it's really good.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Truly tasteless and not funny.  Yeah.  Anthony, O2 go.  Oh, my God, Opie.  O2 go.  You know what it is?  It's water.  Distilled water, which is very healthy for you. 
[02:39:30]  And they oxygenate it.  So it's got more oxygen in it than regular water.  And I don't just mean, Mario, that you get half a bottle of water.  Like half is water and the top half is oxygen.  No, they infuse it.  Infuse it.  Sure, why not?  Wait a minute.  Infuse.  No, it's L-P-Q-R-D-M-62.  Infuse.  It's water.  It's water with oxygen, Opie.  And you know what that does?  Do you?  It makes you more healthy, more alert. 
[02:40:00]  Oxygen's great for the body.  I know it quenches the thirst.  I would go out on a limb here.  It's water!  I'm going to go out on a limb now.  With oxygen.  I'm going to say without oxygen, we would die.  I'm going out on a limb.  But if there's oxygen in the water, is it carbonated?  Is it sparkly?  No.  It tastes just like regular water, but it's better for you.  Oh, that sounds delicious.  Oh, to go!  Opie and Anthony.  Every afternoon, including Saturday afternoon.  1027 WNEW. 
[02:40:30]  Hey, we want to thank Mario Cantone for stopping by today.  Thank you, boys.  I had a great time.  It makes our job very easy when it comes in to visit.  You feed me with love, material, comedy, and tragedy.  And I love you both so much.  Caroline's, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday here in New York.  Yeah, come on down.  212-757-4100.  Reservations, please come.  All right.  You want to play What Did We Learn Today?  Yes, I do want to play What Did I Learn Today?  We love this part of the show.  Me, too. 
[02:41:00]  Eric, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned that chains equal the Zoloft.  Chains equal Zoloft.  You got that, right?  And that Joan Crawford could take on Tyson.  Yeah.  You bet your ass I could.  All right.  Take care, boys.  Goodbye, boys.  Sergio, what's going on?  I learned that Michael Jackson is now a geisha girl.  Hey!  Yeah, we didn't really talk about the video that much.  Yeah, I think we put it together.  You got to see it for yourself. 
[02:41:30]  It's horrific.  It's brutal.  He's a gang leader, once again, in one of his videos.  His expression when he's looking with Chris Tucker, and they're looking at the girl, and  it's like, no, she was looking at me.  I can handle this.  I can handle this.  And he tries to, at one point, make this mean face where he, you know, crinkles his nose  up, and it was like, don't, you'll break it.  Stop it.  It's going to crack.  And he's got, he must have had Botox.  His face doesn't move.  There's no emotion.  No, he doesn't move at all.  Botox face, Botox face.  It doesn't move. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, he looks like, he looks like Jim Carrey in the mask.  Yeah, it really does look like a mask.  Yeah.  And the nose, you know, it's been said a million times, the nose isn't even human anymore.  No.  It's in a shape that I've never seen before.  Like an alien, like the alien drawings that Betty and Barney Hill made.  It really looks like he's going to, it looks like he's going to rip off his face and go,  I'm really Macaulay Culkin.  I think we have some clips from the video.  Look at that.  Chicken. 
[02:42:30]  She looks homeless.  Was that Ham Gun?  No.  That was hard to understand.  No, that was Chris Tucker.  Because I heard Chris Tucker.  Yeah.  And then he just went, he just said, he looks good.  She looks good.  She looks good.  I'm a tough guy.  Liza, I want you to sink over the rainbow.  I can't.  It was my mother's song.  Please sink it for me.  I just, I just can't.  Please.  Okay.  If you buy me a young people's plate at the International House of Pancakes with extra bacon eyebrows. 
[02:43:00]  I heard she did that I love you Michael thing both nights.  Both nights.  So it wasn't like the spontaneous little thing.  So Hollywood.  All right, let's check out this clip.  Let's check out this clip.  Ooh, that ain't right.  Oh my God.  That girl's a pretty young thing.  Come here, girl.  You see, look at that in me.  That girl is mine.  You know it.  Come on.  Come on, man.  Pretty. 
[02:43:30]  Oh my God.  Chris, that's it.  That's the girl I've seen all day.  Come on.  That's Michael Jackson.  He keeps doing it.  Pretending that he's excited over a woman.  Chris is like going, shaman, shaman.  Like Michael used to say shaman.  Shaman.  Remember shaman?  Shaman.  Shaman.  If you look in the lyric sheet, it says come on.  Come on.  And so, like, does he use it all the time?  Like, shaman, kid, shaman.  Let's go on the road.  Shaman.  Shaman.  When he's having sexes, he's like, I'm going to show him.  I mean, what, you know, what?  Here's shaman. 
[02:44:00]  Don't tell.  Here's more of Michael checking out chicks.  Look at that.  I got this one.  She's good.  That's it.  She looks homeless.  Yeah, that was him going.  Yes, she looks real good.  And then, finally, Michael with Brando.  You're pretty cute in there.  I don't know who you are.  Bing, bang.  That sounds like some clean part to a gay porn film. 
[02:44:30]  You look pretty cute in there.  Pretty cute in there.  I know who you are.  Well, that didn't translate well to radio.  Well, you got to see it.  It's bizarre.  We tried that for you.  What was that?  Clean parts of a porn film.  Hey, we got some audio from that movie.  Here it is.  Yeah.  How was that? 
[02:45:00]  That was brilliant.  Sounds like good.  Yeah, they all can't be winners.  Riveting.  Kat, what's going on?  Hey, I learned three things today.  Yeah.  Mario can be rugged.  That's right, Kat.  Come here, everybody.  Big Ben Patton's show should have been called  an eight ball is not enough.  Oh.  Ah, there you go.  And Angelina Jolie, bad enough she's given money to them  as a private citizen, but she's like an honorary ambassador  to the U.N. to Sierra Leone.  So she's kind of representing our country.  Yeah, she is like a goodwill ambassador, they call her.  So is Shirley Temple.  I hope that's like immediately revoked.  All right.  Thank you, Kat.  Thank you, guys.  Have a great night. 
[02:45:30]  All right.  Let's go to Silo.  Silio.  Who's this?  Hello?  Hey, what's up, man?  What's up?  Hey, not much.  Today I learned that Angelina Jolie, that friggin' Hua,  just bought someone a crop duster.  Oh, God.  Imagine what you could buy with a million dollars.  Thank you, bro.  All right.  We got to get out of here.  Mario Cantone, thank you.  Thank you, Opie.  Yes, Mario, always a pleasure.  I'll see you again soon.  Caroline's all this weekend.  Please call.  You won't regret it.  Yeah.  And we'll see a bunch of you guys down at the WWF 
[02:46:00]  for the final episode of Tough Enough with Al Snow.  Yeah.  Okay?  Yeah.  If not, we'll see you on the radio tomorrow.  I'm going to sing New York, New York at the WWF.  Thank you.
