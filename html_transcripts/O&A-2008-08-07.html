<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  It began with a discussion of the New York Jets' signing of Brett Favre, analyzing the team's desperation and Favre's age, with caller Brooklyn Ace predicting another disappointing season. This led to a broader conversation about aging athletes and awkwardly-fitting jerseys.  Jimmy Norton then recounted a childhood fight with Boomer Esiason resulting in a broken arm.  The hosts subsequently discussed the firing of Wild 94.9 DJs Jazzy and Breezy for a "free breasts" April Fool's Day prank, debating the appropriateness of the decision.  Numerous callers weighed in on these topics.  Other segments included a news story about a man waking up before his autopsy, Jimmy's upcoming nose surgery, and a "100 Grand" prank call.  Robert Kelly and other guests were present throughout the broadcast, along with audio clips featuring Joe Namath.

The show continued with Opie describing a strange experience with his dog, speculating about ghosts or a stroke. This transitioned to a discussion of tightrope walker Philippe Petit, mocking his name and recalling a previous interview, focusing on the excessive detail in his documentary about a tarp. A caller's confusion about a rainbow in a sprinkler led to a discussion about rainbows and basic science, further fueled by a listener's video presenting unusual theories.  Robert Kelly was in studio promoting a show, and this sparked a highly sexually suggestive and offensive conversation about the hosts' preferences for pregnant women, including a graphic reminiscence of a past incident involving a pregnant woman, implying induced labor and other inappropriate actions; they even viewed a naked picture of this woman who had her baby soon after the broadcast.  Further segments included a listener's *Silence of the Lambs* song parody, Opie's physical therapy with a pregnant trainer, a listener-submitted leprechaun video, and clips of unusual eyewitness accounts.  A significant portion focused on a negative interaction with Ben Stein over an advertisement perceived as anti-Semitic, with the hosts defending their use of the phrase "chew down." They also discussed a political ad featuring Paris Hilton and John McCain and Ben Stein's reaction.

The next section focused on Paris Hilton's criticism of John McCain, transitioning into a lengthy discussion of the online game EverQuest, detailing Anthony's past gameplay, potion-making, and raiding experiences, including death and retrieving virtual items.  The conversation returned to Ben Stein's reaction to Paris Hilton, with the hosts expressing disbelief and mocking him. A caller, Jimmy, discussed Paris Hilton's appearance, leading to sexually explicit descriptions.  Jimmy also discussed his jaw injury and speech impediment. Mike Birbiglia then joined in studio, detailing a recent comedy show where he was heavily booed, comparing the experience to rape and expressing his distress.  The hosts and Birbiglia discussed the reasons for the booing (including a failed car giveaway).  Later, Lewis Black joined the show, discussing his career, the demands of fame, the presidential election, and his own employment situation amidst a company merger.  The conversation included sexually explicit jokes and anecdotes from his promotional tour.

A rambling discussion followed, covering oil drilling in Los Angeles (with a bizarre tangent about baby feet as fuel), presidential candidates (including heavily criticized and offensive comments about Michael Bloomberg, John McCain, and Barack Obama), cell phone providers, the iPhone, and the "I Am Rich" app (with vulgar commentary on Steve Jobs). One host discussed his weight loss, and Lewis Black made another appearance, promoting his new CD and participating in vulgar jokes and banter, along with a video featuring explicit sexual content. An interview with eco-therapist Melissa Pickett quickly devolved into vulgar interruptions and offensive jokes, punctuated by the recurring "Ramone" character doing a prank call. TJ Miller was also present in studio during this segment.

The final segment centered on Jimmy Norton's upcoming sinus surgery and the pre-operative fasting requirements, with conflicting information from medical professionals.  Callers offered (sometimes contradictory) advice.  Funny moments included a caller claiming to be a doctor, a "magic time" midnight gag, and Norton's humorous surgery predictions.  The hosts joked about the show being better without Norton.  Anthony recounted a bizarre experience getting a Klonopin prescription refill. T.J. Miller, Mike Birbiglia, and Bobby Kelly were in studio, participating in comedic exchanges.  The segment concluded with discussions of the "Line of the Day" and other listener submissions.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Morning, morning, morning, morning.  Hi.  It is everywhere.  It happened in the middle of the night.  A lot of New Yorkers are waking up to the fact that we have Brett Favre.  Brett Favre.  As our quarterback.  Yeah.  That's just like having Tom Brady, right?  Of course it is.  Yuck.  That's what I say. 
[00:00:30]  Someone out there in the media has to say it.  Yuck.  He retired.  And there was a reason for that.  No kid anymore.  And now New York has him on the Jets.  And it just goes to show you how desperate the Jets have been for a quarterback for so long  that everyone's freaking out over this.  Yeah, there's a lot of excitement in New York City.  They had John Montone.  He does, like, all news here in New York City. 
[00:01:00]  John Montone.  Getting the vibe of the street, man.  Let's see what New Yorkers think about Brett Favre.  He's no Broadway Joe.  I heard that this morning.  Yeah, trying to compare Broadway Joe.  They might as well bring back Broadway Joe.  At least it would be more fun to watch him get drunk and try to pick up girls on the field.  I don't know.  He's a big name, obviously.  Brett Favre.  I don't know. 
[00:01:30]  He hasn't thrown a football in 10 months.  Yeah.  The boys have been training for the last two or so.  They're getting ready for the season.  And you're going to throw a 39-year-old quarterback in there.  Yep.  That retired because he knew that his skills were diminishing.  He had a fine year last year.  You know, you can't take that away from him.  But does he have another one in him?  Maybe.  And the Jets say goodbye to Chad.  Chad Pennington.  I don't know where he's going.  Did they say goodbye or were they trying to hammer something out? 
[00:02:00]  I don't know.  It's over, Johnny.  Yeah.  I don't know if it's official, but I think they're saying that they're training him later today.  Wasn't he the young guy of the future?  Like, wasn't he the one that they looked at like this is the guy?  Yeah, yeah.  They're going to bring him up.  Jimmy, he was supposed to be our Tom Brady.  I remember the comparison.  You know, the Pats got Tom Brady, but the Jets have Chad.  Chad Pennington.  And Chad, actually, didn't he kind of come alive there last season?  Well, his shoulder's been just a mess.  Oh, is that it? 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, he's...  But then the shoulder's healthy.  I don't know.  He has a couple of good games, then he hurts his shoulder.  Oh, good.  He's been injured almost every year we've had him.  Yeah, I remember them saying the latest shoulder injury, that was it for him.  And then next to the show, he rehabs, and he's playing.  I don't know.  I liked Chad Pennington.  I thought he had a lot of potential.  He never lived up to his potential, blah, blah, blah, as the Pats just marched to Super Bowl  after Super Bowl after Super Bowl.  I don't know why we didn't just get Joe Feisman. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Come on.  Bring him in.  You know, you bring up...  That leg's got to be okay.  You bring up a good point.  This is going to end up another legendary sports figure in a awkward-looking jersey.  Yeah.  Like, that's not a...  Wait.  Why is he in a...  Why isn't Jordan in a Bulls uniform anymore?  Yeah.  It just looks weird.  They all did it, too.  I mean, here in New York, Walt Frazier in a Cleveland Cavaliers jersey. 
[00:03:30]  What?  Huh?  I want to remember these guys in their jersey.  Yeah.  Walt Frazier, Knicks.  Especially when they spend so much of their career in one jersey.  It's just going to look weird.  Yeah.  Although, you know, there's a lot of green in the Packers colors, too.  So maybe...  Copac Gore.  Maybe Brett Favre will look okay in the Jets uniform.  Yeah.  We'll have to wait and see.  But it looks to me that he hasn't been, you know, throwing the ball much.  No.  He was living the high life.  He was retired. 
[00:04:00]  He was probably just having a good old time.  And then he got bored and said, you know what?  I want to play one more year.  Just kind of sitting around, letting that beard grow out.  That gray beard.  I know.  He really does have to shave.  That gives the fans confidence.  When your star player walks out on the field and he's got gray hair.  I'm gray beard, the quarterback.  Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Well, Brooklyn Ace, he's a big Jets fan.  Let's see what this means to the Jets this year.  Brooklyn Ace, what's up?  Another year of mediocrity. 
[00:04:30]  That's exactly what it means.  Is that what you're predicting?  The quarterback that you're thinking about that did well last year was Kellen Clemens.  Kellen Clemens has gone on his own.  Oh, right.  Okay.  And he's going to be the quarterback.  There's no question Kellen Clemens is going to be our quarterback.  The problem is we've got to deal with Brett Fogg for the next, oh, I don't know, five or six games.  Until the Jets realize, oh, he can't throw the ball anymore.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  All right, boys.  All right.  Thanks, Brooklyn Ace.  No, it's a – I mean, New York teams, they just have a way of getting these guys when they're way too old and way past their prime. 
[00:05:00]  Yep.  We do it all the time.  You know the Yankees do it.  Oh, they're the worst.  Jimmy talks about that all the time.  You've got these great players that sound good, but then you start looking up their stats.  They're 45 years old, and they're now batting .220.  It's because these owners have these desires to have these great players, but then when the other teams are ready to let them go,  what does it tell you that they traded Favre? 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  They want – Favre's a Hall of Fame – first ballot Hall of Fame player.  They wanted him to retire at Green Bay Packers.  And they know him more than anybody would.  Well, but also, I mean, in all fairness, you know, he retires, and then the team decided to just move on.  Uh-huh.  And they moved on, and then you got Brett Favre saying, but I want to play another year.  But they already got everything figured out for the new guy.  I don't know –  Yeah, sorry.  I don't know the new guy's name yet.  I'm sorry.  But they have a lot of confidence in the new guy up there in Green Bay. 
[00:06:00]  And now Brett wants to play again, so that kind of threw the organization into a little bit of a state of disarray.  Yeah.  Someone suggesting Boomer Esiason.  We saw him eating steak a couple weeks back, right, Jimmy?  That guy isn't playing football anytime soon.  What a big-scaled man.  Oh.  He's a giant of a big –  God.  His head is – 
[00:06:30]  You would literally have to hit him with a bier to knock him out.  Tell me about it.  What?  Oh, that's right.  I punched him right in the forehead and broke my arm.  Swear to God.  Both bones, the ulna and the radius.  Mm-hmm.  Cracked them both, punching him in the head.  It wasn't even like I broke my arm, like he grabbed it and twisted it and broke it.  I punched him as hard as I could, and he put his head down a little bit, and I hit him right in the forehead and just crack.  Look at my little Anthony bones.  Was that the end of the fight right there, or did he hit you, or that was it? 
[00:07:00]  Oh, he beat the crap out of me after that.  There I am now, fighting him with a broken arm.  I pretty much handicapped myself right at the beginning.  Ooh, that hurt.  I got thrown a beating.  Let's say hi to Mike in New York.  I'm a boomer.  Mike A.  Hey, what's up, Mo?  What's up, man?  Hey, man.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thanks.  He got a crappy daddy.  Oh, totally.  He was Biff Tannen. 
[00:07:30]  I was George McFly.  Hey, you gave it a shot, though.  How many guys would even give it a shot?  Well, I had no choice.  You got right in there.  I was going to run home, and everyone was waiting outside.  It was one of those big build-up fights that everyone knew about.  Classic.  You know, school ends.  You go outside.  Everyone's waiting.  He's there.  Kept my jacket on so I'd have padding.  Didn't matter.  I threw the first punch.  I thought, this is, you know, what Dad taught me. 
[00:08:00]  It was get in there, throw that first punch.  And I did, and snap, crackle, pop went my bones.  I had little Anthony bones.  And then, bam, he punched me in the face and in the stomach.  And I was laying on the ground.  I think he kicked me a few times.  Called me names.  I got up bloody and weeping.  Why wouldn't I cry?  I cried at everything.  He's had a reason to. 
[00:08:30]  Boomer Esiason just pummeled me.  And you got a broken arm.  Yeah.  And I got a broken arm to boot.  Threw you a good beating.  Oh.  Just a savage beating by a big-headed dope.  Dump jock.  Big jock.  Just taking care of an emaciated little kid.  Was it your dad's influence that made you have to fight this guy?  Yeah.  No, it was.  I couldn't leave.  There were too many people around where if I left, that would have been, they'd still 
[00:09:00]  be on me.  Yeah.  I took my beating, you know.  What are you going to do?  I got one good punch in that broke my arm.  But I hit him.  Hit him in his head.  He laughed at it.  At least he didn't do the ultimate degradation, which he used to do in the cafeteria, which  is just, like, put his butt right by your head and let one loose.  He used to do that to everyone in the cafeteria.  So me laying on the ground beat up, that would have been really degrading if you just, you  know. 
[00:09:30]  When you hit him, did you do that move where you waited for a second to see if it did any  damage?  Yeah, yeah.  Damage assessment.  And then he had the look on his face of a bit of shock.  Yeah.  And then he just kind of wipes his mouth.  He didn't even wipe his mouth.  And then smiles like, look, it did nothing.  He put his head down.  It was one of those things where I went to punch him in the mouth or the nose.  Yeah.  And he did a quick, like, bam, like his head bobbed down really quick.  And I clocked him in the forehead.  And his head came back up.  And then he just wailed me. 
[00:10:00]  Like, it was that fast.  I didn't even know what happened.  I'm like, I just knew I connected.  So I was hoping, against all hope, that he would fall down.  But no, I fell down.  What was the issue?  I called him Norman.  Which is his real name.  Even back then in elementary school, he was known as Boomer.  He never called him Norman.  So I yelled Norman around the corner.  And he didn't see who it was.  But the second I turned around, one of his buddies was standing there looking at me with a smile on his face. 
[00:10:30]  And he was nodding.  Like, I saw you just called Boomer Norman.  And then I was like, oh, please, please don't tell him.  Could you just not tell him?  I was just joking.  And the guy's like, Boomer!  Boomer!  Goomy, I just called you Norman.  I'll kick his ass.  Yeah, okay.  And that's all it took?  That's all it took.  But that's how it is back in the school days.  Yeah.  It was, you know, simple stuff.  You fought over the dumbest things. 
[00:11:00]  Right.  Let's say hi to Mike.  He's been in the background for the last ten minutes.  Mike in New York.  What's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I got a quick stat for you on Brett Favre.  Yeah.  Since the time that he has been quarterback with Green Bay, 200 and, like, 60-something consecutive games,  the Jets have had 15 different quarterbacks.  Wow.  In the same time period.  15 quarterbacks.  In the same time period, yeah.  Checked it out this morning.  That's about right. 
[00:11:30]  Thank you, Mike.  I appreciate it.  15.  Let's go to Nicky D in California.  Nicky D.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  Hi.  How you doing, guys?  Hey, listen, I just wanted to mention you guys were talking about seeing classic players  in awkward uniforms.  Yeah.  I was going to mention, what about Joe Montana in a Kansas City uniform?  Kansas City Chief.  That's right.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, being from California, being a 49er kid all growing up, I mean, that was just  heartbreaking.  And also seeing Jerry Rice in an Oakland uniform.  I mean, come on. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  You know.  I think there's a baseball kid all growing up.  I mean, I saw Wade Boggs go to the Yankees, and then just recently seeing Johnny Damon  go to the Yankees.  I mean, that was just a big attack.  Well, it's not as...  That's exactly what you guys are saying.  Sorry, Nicky D.  It's not as strange these days because, you know, players get traded a lot more often.  I mean...  One that was your classic quarterback, one that was, like, heartbreaking, was watching  Joe Namath in a Rams uniform.  Was it a Rams uniform?  Yeah.  I was trying to remember.  That was...  Oh, God. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  It was a lot stranger when we were growing up because these guys weren't traded a lot.  They did spend most of their careers on one team.  No.  And then they won a couple more years or one more year, so they would go to these teams  and just look weird in their uniform.  With his grandpa knees in his Rams uniform.  Yeah.  Isn't there a website dedicated to this?  Oh, look at him.  Yeah, that's...  I think we've gone down this road a few times.  We'll try to link something up on ondayradio.com.  Yes, Nicky D.  Oh, no.  That's all I pretty much wanted to say.  You guys have a good one. 
[00:13:00]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Bruce, Louisiana.  What's up?  Yeah, you guys are a bunch of crybabies.  Yeah.  You have the...  He only lost to the Super Bowl winning team last year.  He was one game from the Super Bowl.  He's got the best...  I mean...  Shows he can't close the deal.  ...except the touchdown record that Tom Brady just got last year.  Give him a chance before you go knocking it.  Jesus Christ.  This is what New Yorkers do. 
[00:13:30]  He's 39 years old.  And guess...  You know what the Packers got?  He's got the 40 when he was 39.  Right.  And they didn't win a Super Bowl with him either, stupid.  Yeah, the Packers got a draft pick, and it depends on how well Brett Favre does for the Jets.  So if he was this great quarterback, why didn't the Packers get a lot more for him?  Right.  Thank you.  He's just yelling over us.  Dan O in Kentucky, what's going on?  All the Packers got for him was his weight and liverwurst.  That was a terrible trade. 
[00:14:00]  Goes go with cheese, though, Jimmy.  You know what's heartbreaking, too?  Seeing Ted Williams in some different team's hat.  See, it's just his head.  It's just his head.  It's not a uniform.  It's so weird seeing Billy Martin's head through the windshield of a Mets bus.  He said, well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body.  We can freeze his head.  And punt. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, and punt.  Whatever happened to that douche?  Dan O, what do you got?  Good morning, boy.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  What about a Pete Rose in a Phillies uniform?  Booyah!  Booyah!  Have we explained booyah on this side yet?  I'm trying to figure out a way to convey that story.  We will.  Carl, New York.  Hey, in the new version of the Madden football game that's coming out in a couple weeks, 
[00:15:00]  all the packaging and all the promos have Brett in his Green Bay uniform.  Yeah.  He's on the cover of the new Madden game?  Yeah, they wanted to avoid the Madden curse of, like, a player always sucking.  They decided to get a guy who was retiring, and then he decided to unretire.  Yeah, they got some weird curse with the Madden game.  I read about this.  Whoever's on the cover ends up having a horrific year.  Kevin from Connecticut is saying, it's weird seeing Corey Lytle in a 17th floor living room.  Not accurate, by the way. 
[00:15:30]  That's horrible.  He tried, but not accurate.  No?  He never made it into the living room.  No?  Oh, no.  Oh, damn.  The plane bounced back.  Yeah.  He got a quick peek in the window.  Yeah, yeah.  He assessed the drapes and then fell to his death.  I think he was, I think, I think he said, I think I might make it through this.  And then the plane said, no, we're going backwards.  I'm sorry.  Didn't have enough momentum.  Hey, you were mentioning Joe Namath.  Yes.  There was a great phone call we didn't get to, but they're basically asking if Boomer Esiason 
[00:16:00]  was Tank Hankerson.  Tank Hankerson.  He was absolutely Tank Hankerson.  Yeah.  Back in elementary school, just the darling of the gym teacher.  Yeah.  Good at everything.  He over-excelled at every sport you played in gym to the point where he hurt every single  kid that he had to play against.  No matter what it was, no matter what we were playing, he had to hurt them.  And the gym teacher was so gung-ho and in love with this kid that he would let him do 
[00:16:30]  anything.  He had carte blanche to just wreck whoever was in gym class with him.  And he was a big jock and we were all like skinny little kids.  I remember right after Christmas vacation, I was so excited, I brought in my dune buggy wheelies.  You ever see dune buggy wheelies?  It was a little remote-controlled dune buggy, but it wasn't radio controlled.  It was, you know, I had a cord and a little thing you held with the batteries and then it 
[00:17:00]  would spin in circles.  It would do a wheelie.  It had a cord.  Yeah, you didn't get radio control stuff back then.  Christ.  That was the future.  So it did spins.  You might remember dune buggy wheelies.  And I was messing around with it in the classroom and Boomer came running in and stomped on it  like it was a bug.  And my dune buggy, all I was left with was tattered plastic at the end of an electrical cord. 
[00:17:30]  He's a dick.  What a douche.  What a dick.  He just wouldn't leave anyone alone.  Anyone.  Oh, that's classic.  My dune buggy wheelies.  All right.  We got to go to our first break.  Brandon Williams, by the way, from Boston.  To answer OP's question, whatever happened to that douche question, we still harass his message  board to the point it's almost unusable by his own fan.  Well, that's good to know.  Oh, good. 
[00:18:00]  I love that we move on from these things and the pests don't.  I love that.  No, Boomer did not tape my buns shut and have to spend time in detention.  We go to break.  Funny, Kevin.  So if you're just waking up, the Jets got Brett Favre in the middle of the night, I believe.  I got an email from my brother, Brother Elmo, at like 2 in the morning.  Jesus.  I don't know if he's happy.  That important?  Oh, wait.  I think he is happy.  Well, he doesn't sleep.  He's whatever. 
[00:18:30]  He's dealing with his own demons all night long, whatever he does.  Yeah, Darren writes, holy favore.  Bad news is, looks like my Bills will lose two more games this year, but at least I could  choose the Jets in my weekly picks now.  So he thinks this is great for the Jets to have Brett Favre.  He's got a lot of confidence, does he?  Yes, he does.  Very confident.  We go to break with the drunk Joe Namath clip.  We love this thing.  We love it.  We haven't played this in a while.  Opie and Anthony.  One of the all-time great Jets quarterbacks, Joe Namath and Chad Pennington, what impresses 
[00:19:00]  you about Chad?  I believe everything that anyone else has watched, Chad Slay impresses me the same thing impresses  them.  He's a quality, classy quarterback that has a touch on the football.  He's not a thrower.  He's a passer.  His mind is ahead of what the defense is.  And if the Jets can support him, they will win the championship. 
[00:19:30]  So it's been a tough season for Jets fans.  What does it mean to you now when the team is struggling?  Chad?  I want to kiss you.  I couldn't care less about the team struggling.  What we know is we can improve.  Chad missed.  Chad Pennington, our quarterback, missed the first part of the season and we struggled.  We're looking for next season. 
[00:20:00]  We're looking to make a noise now and I want to kiss you.  Thanks, Joe.  Yeah.  A huge compliment.  Joe Namath, part of the fourth decade's team.  We'll see you guys at halftime.  Opie and Anthony, good morning, everybody.  How are you today?  I actually want to thank everybody for listening to this fine radio show.  We greatly appreciate it.  Thank you.  You never know when it's going to go away. 
[00:20:30]  I say that because...  Because another radio show went bye-bye.  For probably the dumbest reason I've ever heard.  Yeah, corporate's got to wake the F up.  And they've got to start protecting their radio shows again.  They really have to.  Corporate, man.  There was a day when corporate did the right thing.  They hired edgy jocks. 
[00:21:00]  The story I'm about to read, they're not even edgy, really.  They hired the edgy jocks.  The jocks do what they're supposed to do.  Be a little edgy.  Get people talking.  Get that water cooler talk happening.  And then, like, if they got into some kind of trouble,  corporate protected them and tried to save their asses.  Yeah.  Not anymore.  Corporate just fires jocks left and right now.  Doesn't matter what company.  It's this company.  It's every company out there.  And this is stupid.  They've got to go back to the old ways. 
[00:21:30]  They have to if they want to save this business.  You got this show Jazzy and Breezy, I guess.  Sounds good.  Jazzy and Breezy.  Blown out over breasts.  All right.  Now, you might think it's something very inappropriate.  Yeah.  Something titillating.  Yes.  Or is there some squeezy squeezies going on?  Uh-huh.  Something against company policy, I'm sure.  So Jazzy and Breezy got blown out for this. 
[00:22:00]  In a surprising and unfortunate turn of events,  ST Daily has learned that longtime KYLD,  I guess it's wild.  Wild.  A radio station called Wild out there in San Francisco.  Hey, wild.  You ever do the wild show out there in San Francisco, Jimmy?  Ah, man.  Too much craziness happening there.  Yeah.  Who needs that?  This is the first problem.  If you're going to call your radio station wild,  you should let your jocks get a bit wild.  Yeah.  Right?  Wait until you hear what they got fired for.  All right. 
[00:22:30]  Not quite wild.  Oh, and it's the PD that got fired.  PD Jazzy Jim Archer and Night Jock Joe Breezy  were terminated late yesterday  over what was supposed to have been a wacky April Fool's bit  that offered up as a prize free breasts  from a certain Dr. Sanders.  So they're doing a contest.  Oh, brother.  You know, we're going to give away a pair of breasts  from Dr. Sanders.  Dr. Sanders?  On April Fool's.  Uh-huh. 
[00:23:00]  Some dummy bought into this, by the way.  Turns out the breasts in question  were actually chicken breasts from KFC.  Get it?  Dr. Sanders?  This is Colonel Sanders.  Well, they had him.  Is it Dr. 2?  Well, yeah.  Nobody would want their bosoms fixed by Colonel Sanders.  Of course not.  Who's the chicken, man?  I don't want him to touch them.  Frank Perdue was doing a vagina.  Oh!  Nice for love.  I was trying to get out a vagioplasty. 
[00:23:30]  I just didn't know if that was the word.  Vagioplasty?  Yeah, you know how they fix the vagina.  Sure.  I don't know if that's what it's called either.  Probably not.  I should have the same operation on my mouth.  Probably it's not working.  I think it's pretty close to what Jimmy said, though.  Turns out the breasts, yeah,  were chicken breasts from KFC.  Get it.  Everyone laughed except the winner.  So the winner gets pissed off.  You were the joke.  Sorry.  Yeah.  You were the joke for April Fool's.  April Fool's, you're the joke. 
[00:24:00]  We did this type of thing many times in our careers.  Deal with it.  We did the old 100 grand giveaway.  Yep.  Rocco, back in the day, gave away a toy Yoda.  Toy Yoda.  Remember that dumb thing?  It's a toy of Yoda.  Well, you didn't know that.  You really thought you were winning a Toyota.  Yeah.  But how he said Toy Yoda.  That happened to some manager over at Hooters also.  He had had a contest that if the girls, 
[00:24:30]  whichever one sells the most, I think,  would win a Toyota.  And they wound up giving her a toy  of the little character Yoda.  Aw.  And she was very upset and sued.  I believe she won.  You can't do that Toy Yoda gag.  Because the intent is to make someone think they're winning a car.  Yes.  We all speak the same language.  We get what the intent is.  Misconception.  Well, this winner was very mad that she didn't actually get her boob job  and that she got, you know, chicken breasts from KFC.  Let's see. 
[00:25:00]  Let's see.  Accept the winner.  She was mad.  Who was apparently laboring under the illusion  she was getting some other kind of breasts.  Okay.  ST Daily learned that two weeks after accepting her chicken,  along with...  The station made good on this whole thing.  Oh, okay.  Along with front row Kanye West tickets,  $500 in Victoria's Secret certificates,  and backstage passes to the station's annual Wild Jam concert.  Wow.  A bunch of padded bras.  Among other door prizes. 
[00:25:30]  So they knew she was mad,  so the station turned around and did the right thing.  Like, look.  Yeah, hooked her up.  Yeah, this was a big gag.  Sorry that it had to be on you,  but here's a lot of great stuff.  Enjoy.  That wasn't good enough for this bitch.  The woman's lawyer filed a lawsuit against the station,  and now the ultimate price has been paid.  They fired Jazzy,  and they fired Breezy over this dumb, dumb radio thing.  Why would they just fire that?  This who-gives-a-crap radio stunt they did. 
[00:26:00]  That doesn't seem like a firing offense.  Well, again, it's just another thing in our culture.  Something like that.  The woman couldn't just go,  all right, that does suck, but I get it.  Yeah.  She had to go, I want them fired.  Because, once again,  when somebody does anything you don't like,  you have to have them removed.  If you're offended,  you want the people removed.  Because we're just a nation of little sissies and hall monitors.  Yeah.  Well, it's in our intro.  When did radio become nice?  Yeah, it has to be.  Now it has to be nice.  We've got to be so nice, everybody.  We've got to beat up some of you guys 
[00:26:30]  so everyone else laughs.  Yeah.  That's our jobs.  A few of you out there are there  so the rest of us can laugh at you.  That's right.  Just deal with it.  That's the secret of success  as far as radio shows go.  And some days,  you'll get to laugh at other people.  See?  It's just laughing at people  for how stupid they are.  So another radio show bites the dust.  For something that is a non-reason.  They should rename their station Mild.  Because they're doing...  Mild! 
[00:27:00]  I get it.  They're doing mild programming.  There's nothing wild about Wild 94.9.  Not at all.  In San Francisco.  Let's go.  Stupid city.  All right.  Hey, we were talking about John Montone.  The big news here in New York.  Yes.  Brett Farr is now in New York.  Jet, Sonny Ferrelli,  and a lot of other people from Boston  openly laughing at us today.  Openly laughing.  Well, you know.  Basically saying,  enjoy Brett Farr.  They got Tom Brady, so...  Yeah.  Well, of course.  This is how John Montone 
[00:27:30]  did the whole Brett Farr thing today.  Yeah.  And there's a line in here  that's worth playing on the radio.  We love John Montone, by the way.  He has a very unique delivery.  And he's featured in Grand Theft Auto 4.  Is he really?  Yeah.  He does some of the news.  What we like about him,  he'll go out and find  the city's biggest pothole.  Yeah.  And he'll make it interesting  for everybody.  Yes.  He's that guy.  The neighbor's very upset  at this giant pothole.  So what do you think  about this pothole? 
[00:28:00]  Well, it's got to be fixed.  It's got to be fixed.  It's got to be fixed.  Indeed.  Indeed it does.  Well, there's a whole lot  of complaining going on here.  I'm John Montone.  Apparently years of disappointment  melted away  as lifelong Jet fan  John Perry  gushed over Brett Favre.  We got a legitimate ball thrower now.  Yeah.  We got a Hall of Famer.  It'll be good to see him.  Perry believes 
[00:28:30]  Favre can lead  the Jets  to the Super Bowl.  Favre did win  a Super Bowl,  but he also lost  Cameron Diaz  in the movie  There's Something  About Mary.  And that  had to hurt.  John Montone  10-10 wins.  Why did you bring that up?  I don't know.  Brett had a cameo  in that dumb movie.  Why did you bring that up  with this story?  I want to show  that I knew that. 
[00:29:00]  That would be the movie  with the  in her hair.  Let's say hi  to Space Trucker.  Space Trucker.  Good morning, boys.  How are you?  All right.  Hey, man.  Jimmy, I love  the new message  set up you've got.  Thanks a lot.  Oh, thank you, man,  very much.  Wait, what's up  with this message thing, Jimmy?  I'm hearing things.  I just keep forgetting  to give the number out.  It's 917-267-2602. 
[00:29:30]  I actually just update  and leave messages and stuff.  It's like you can call me  and I actually hear the messages.  So what, you update  this message for everybody?  Yeah, sometimes, yeah.  Is it silly messages?  Is it jokes?  What do you do?  Silly.  It depends on what's going on.  If there's something happening.  I think the last time I called  was when I was in the trailer  getting ready to do the sagat roast.  I was so whacked out and tired.  I think I just left  an outgoing message.  And sometimes it's rants  and things like that?  Yeah, it can be anything.  I mean, I've only done  a few so far,  but I'll call tomorrow morning,  I think, after surgery.  Hey, that's a great idea.  Tomorrow morning?  Yeah, Jimmy's going in  for surgery tomorrow.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:30:00]  Yes.  Yeah.  They put you completely out?  They do.  Less than an hour.  That's it?  That's it.  And then I fix my nose.  Drill it out.  They probably,  like, I always say this,  you always think surgery  is this delicate thing  where these doctors  are moving their hands around  like they're playing  the operation game.  It is.  Take out a wrenched ankle.  And then you just see these films  and they got like a mallet  and a chisel  and they're just going  wham, wham, wham 
[00:30:30]  on people's nose bones.  They're taking Makita drills  and just drilling through you  and, oh, it's brutal.  Take those big probes  and just pull things out.  Like, ow!  I hope the anesthesia  keeps me out.  Oh, wouldn't that all be horrible  if you woke up  and they didn't know  you were awake?  And you're like,  I'm awake.  Please.  Help me.  I can feel that.  Your eyes can't even move  so they know that you're awake.  I'm awake. 
[00:31:00]  That happens a couple times  a year, right?  I'm alive.  Why are we freaking him out?  He's going into surgery tomorrow.  Please don't bury me.  I'm alive.  And then they knew  because one lone tear  rolled down his cheek  and they went,  oh my God,  this man's alive!  I'm not worried about it.  It's only an hour.  Not that I would want that,  but it's not like  they're doing  like a 12-hour procedure.  Yes.  You know,  one of those weird ones  where you have,  for the toe to survive,  they have to implant it  into your breastbone.  You know,  one of those creepy theories.  This is easy. 
[00:31:30]  I like that.  Yeah, it's easy.  They'll go in,  they'll bore a hole.  It's routine.  Fix my nose,  make me a happy boy.  Hole of bore?  Speaking of being alive,  there's a story  in the news today  that just reminded me  of, Anthony.  Dead,  excuse me,  dead man awakens  before autopsy.  Before autopsy.  Best time to wake up  if you're gonna.  He shocks doctors  by asking for a glass of water  as they're about to cut into him  for the autopsy. 
[00:32:00]  An Indian man  who was knocked unconscious  during a stampede  of thousands of religious pilgrims  on a steep Himalayan mountain  path.  I'm sure these doctors  were great.  Woke up as doctors  were preparing  to perform his autopsy.  He'd use a Sherpa knife  on him.  My hair lost consciousness  in a stampede  that killed 150 people  and was triggered  by rumors  of a landslide  leading to a Hindu temple  devoted to the goddess  Naira Herod.  You know,  you can obviously tell 
[00:32:30]  the religions  whose gods  just really don't exist.  Why?  Because whenever  these people  are going to  these religious pilgrimages  and hundreds,  if not sometimes  thousands die,  just stop  with your silly God.  It happens  with good old Jesus.  Every so often  Jesus lets a rock  roll down  on a church bus.  I understand that.  But that's a little  more reasonable  than, you know,  hundreds upon hundreds  or maybe even thousands 
[00:33:00]  dying,  going to this pilgrimage,  trampling each other.  Yeah.  Hey, boys.  Am I still on?  Oh, hey,  Space Trucker.  We were just  talking about a story.  Poor Space Trucker.  His arm's getting tired.  He's got the phone  up to his ear.  Yes.  He's alive, Sam.  Hey, Space Trucker,  woke up.  How do you know  he's alive, Quince?  He asked me for a tang.  Tang.  He asked me for a glass  the Sonny D. 
[00:33:30]  Ready to cut into him.  All right, Space Trucker,  go right ahead.  Space Trucker,  come on.  You just talk over, Jim C.  Go ahead, you go.  You truckers are supposed  to be lonely on the road.  Just sit back and enjoy.  We're having a conversation.  Well, I am.  All right,  what do you need,  Space Trucker?  Well, you mentioned  one of my favorite bits  of all time,  the Thousand Grand Bar.  Can you do that today?  You didn't even say it right.  The Thousand Grand Bar.  You tap-danced  all over my Klugman  just to say it wrong?  I'm sorry.  That would be  a million dollar bar. 
[00:34:00]  That's a hundred grand.  A thousand grand bar.  All right,  we'll do the  hundred grand phone call  going into break.  That's what you're getting at,  right?  Thanks.  All right, brother.  Boy, Space Trucker,  well, I want to say  hi to all the truckers today.  That bit was murdered  by a trucker, Sam.  I didn't see.  You should let me get  a couple lines into it  before we start the music.  Yeah.  I just do one line  and I hear the awful  Quincy music.  I know,  that is just,  but I'm done. 
[00:34:30]  It gets all goofy.  We're in break  40 minutes later  walking to XM.  You want to hear more  about Dead Guy or what?  Of course.  All right.  he says,  when I woke up,  I was in the middle  of a row of bodies  waiting for my autopsy.  My throat was parched  and I asked for water.  Towering over me,  the doctors and nursing staff  at this hospital  looked dazed.  They must have been surprised  to see a dead man  come alive like that.  Wow. 
[00:35:00]  A dead man didn't come alive.  An alive guy woke up?  Yeah.  Idiots.  You know,  but here's the problem  because it's over there  in this country.  Maybe they're,  you know,  maybe they're just not,  what am I trying to say?  Very technologically advanced  in medicine.  Medically,  thank you,  yes.  When they hold a mirror  up in front of their mouths  to see if they're alive?  Yes,  thank you,  because there was a doctor  on this pilgrimage  to this temple  and this doctor is saying  little was done 
[00:35:30]  to see if the victims  of the stampede  were still alive.  So they just assumed  all these people  that got run over  were just dead.  How many live people  really do get autopsied,  I wonder?  There's got to be.  Because you hear about  the ones that just miss,  there's got to be someone  getting that old Y cut  in their chest  when they're still alive.  Why an autopsy  if it was a stampede?  Yeah.  What's a mystery?  Well,  there's a footmark  in his throat.  Could have been it.  Yeah.  Really? 
[00:36:00]  Let's say hi to Louie  in Jersey.  Louie?  You?  Hey, man,  I was in the Navy  and they did an operation  on my nose  because I told them  that I wanted to get  out of a work detail.  So I went to,  had somebody  put me in a nose  and went to Sig Bay  and they operated  on me down in Philly  and I woke up  under anesthesia  with somebody  with a,  what do you call it,  a goddamn spike  in my face 
[00:36:30]  and a guy  hit me with a hammer.  Wait,  the guy was hitting  the spike  with the hammer?  A chisel.  Yeah.  A hammer and a chisel  hit me right in the face  when I woke up  and started flailing  on my arms  and said,  hey,  what the hell  is going on here?  So they had me  into the restraints  and put me back  under.  Well,  if you weren't  a wussy  and you would  have been deployed,  you wouldn't have  to go through that.  Yeah,  that's what you get.  See that?  Oh,  well,  good work,  Jimmy.  Thank you.  I'm fine. 
[00:37:00]  Too good.  Hey,  Anthony from Las Vegas,  he writes,  Anthony's absolutely right.  I work at a hospital  and when I used to  walk by the surgery suites,  it sounded like  an auto shop.  Yeah.  Just hearing machines  and just because  they're wrapped in plastic  and sterilized,  it's the same stuff  that they use  at automotive shops.  Yeah.  Hammers,  chisels,  air guns,  Makita drills,  screwdrivers 
[00:37:30]  for when they're  putting the plates in  and it's just  all that stuff.  It's not this delicate.  I don't know why  I always thought  it was this delicate thing.  I think it is  because of the  kids game operation.  You'd have to be  very careful  and move  very slowly  lest the fat man's  nose lights up  and you lose your turn.  I can't watch  those surgery channels.  Yeah.  I don't know  if there's officially  a surgery channel  but some of these  channels go  surgery mode  for a while.  I saw that  it was called  a scalpel-less 
[00:38:00]  vasectomy once.  The big boot.  Yes,  Doc Martin.  It wasn't quite  scalpel-less.  I think they call it  that but they did  have to make a couple  of small incisions  on the side  of the bag.  Sure.  Very close to the top  and then they went  in with this hooked  probe and pulled out  the white tube, 
[00:38:30]  the tube that carries  the sperm.  The poison.  Yeah,  the stuff that you  don't want  impregnating a woman  anymore.  So they took that  out,  snipped it,  and then cauterized  the ends  of the piece  and it just  looked like,  oh my God,  this guy's going  to wake up  in such pain  because they  pulled it out  with the probe  and really  yanked that tube  out.  It's like,  oh God,  it's just got to  hurt the next day.  Isn't he awake  when that happens  just under local?  Yeah, 
[00:39:00]  I think it's a local.  But you probably  put a sheet up  and say they  don't look at this.  You don't want  to see this.  It looks like  a little thin  piece of angel  hair pasta  that they pull  out,  snip,  and then  cauterize  a little waft  of smoke.  That can be  undone too,  can't it,  if you want  to have kids  in there?  It could be,  but it's not  100%.  It's one of  those things.  It's getting  better actually.  That procedure  to reverse it  is getting better.  Alright,  why don't we  take a break?  We got the  100 grand phone  call for Space 
[00:39:30]  Trucker.  It's Opie  and Anthony,  877-212-0&A.  The listeners  are doing  very well today,  so we'll continue  going to the phones  after the break.  Hi,  who's this?  Hey,  it's Craig  from Walt Dam.  Hey,  Craig,  guess what?  Did I win?  You are the  107th caller.  107th caller.  Come on,  don't worry!  Tell me,  I won!  I won!  I don't know  what you're kidding,  right?  107th.  Oh,  wow!  107th caller,  congratulations.  100 grand!  Oh my God!  You just won  100 grand,  bro.  Oh,  Jesus,  do you know  what I want  to do with that? 
[00:40:00]  What are you  going to do  with 100 grand?  Oh man,  the first thing,  I have this old,  oh,  I cannot,  Jesus,  I gotta calm down.  Calm down,  calm yourself.  I am the winner!  I'm the winner!  Well,  what are you  going to do  with 100 grand?  I got this,  oh man,  I got this  box for a truck,  I've got to get  a new one,  a new truck,  oh,  that,  oh.  Wait,  wait,  dude,  how are you  going to do  that with a candy bar?  What?  How are you  going to do  that with a candy bar?  We just gave you  a 100 grand candy bar.  What do you mean?  We gave away  a 100 grand,  it's a candy bar, 
[00:40:30]  bro,  congratulations.  What?  You just won  a candy bar.  Hey,  what the f***  you've been saying?  I've been listening  to f***ing radio  for like three hours,  man,  you said 100 grand.  Yeah,  100 grand,  we gave you a candy bar.  That's a candy bar.  Congratulations,  buddy boy.  Oh, you guys  are a bunch  of douche s***.  Hey,  hey,  hey,  congratulations,  man.  Uh-oh.  We got Robert Kelly  coming into the studio  to hang with us today.  Also,  Mike Birbiglia 
[00:41:00]  wants to talk about  what happened to him  at the Virus Show  this past Saturday  at the PNC Bank Art Center.  And Louis?  And Louis Black  is stopping by  to say hi,  yeah.  Wow.  He's coming into  New York City  for I think an hour.  What's he doing?  A little promotion  and then he's flying out  for about a month or so.  But he wanted to  stop by and say hi.  I want to say  happy birthday  to a friend of the show.  Oh, come on, man.  Thank you.  No, no.  David Duchovny, 
[00:41:30]  38 years old.  Oh.  He's younger than us?  What?  He's not for us.  He's been around for...  He's not 38.  What?  He's been around forever.  He can't be 38 years old.  Do you think  he's pad in that one?  Most of Hollywood pads.  38.  38.  How long is the X-Files on?  Um...  He's born in 60.  He's 48.  Oh.  Why would we have  the correct birthday?  Who did the...  Why would we?  Who did the addition on that?  Who wrote... 
[00:42:00]  Mike?  Who did that?  Yeah, 38 sounded way too...  Travis, what's wrong?  Travis is going to try  to defend himself.  Was it you?  They're saying he's 48,  not 38.  I just wrote  what the website told me.  He was born in 1960.  There's no way.  Can you get out  of Robert Kelly's way?  Thank you.  He was born in 1960.  Yeah.  Whatever.  David Duchovny's 48.  Bruce Dickinson. 
[00:42:30]  For you heavy metal fans.  The great Bruce Dickinson.  Bruce Dickinson.  Bit of a tool, but...  Is he?  Why?  Because he was  bad-mouthing  Ozzy and Sabbath  when he was opening  for them with Maiden  on the stage.  Really?  And lobbed stuff at him.  Yeah.  All right, right.  He was being a douche.  He was being a baby.  Don't go on the tour  if you don't want to do it.  Beat it.  Stupid.  You and that big robot,  Eddie.  Oh, monster!  Brr!  I'm also getting word 
[00:43:00]  that he was a problem  during the K-Rock interview  here in New York City.  Why would this be fixed?  The guy's...  Yeah, he's just a...  Please, over and over again.  Yeah, I've been  fishing about that for weeks.  What, Jimmy?  I got a picture with him  at YSP a couple years ago  for a meet and greet.  Just, you know,  it was there.  So, of course, I got it.  And he was coming  to do an interview.  Was it with Ian Caulfield,  our afternoon guy?  Afternoon guy here  in New York City, sure.  And so I wasn't  going to be here.  So I left my photo  with Bruce.  I'm like,  hey, just see if he'll sign this.  You know, it's me and him. 
[00:43:30]  And then what happened?  Bruce and his handler there  didn't want K-Rock  to take any photos.  They weren't allowed  to do any video clips  for the web.  And they almost didn't  sign Jimmy's photo.  I am so sick  of musicians and bands  treating the radio stations  like crap.  Was it Bruce or his guy, though?  I don't give a crap.  Well, sometimes you don't know  what your guy is.  No, no.  No, no.  If Bruce wanted to sign,  he would have signed.  Simple as that.  And if Bruce wanted  to do the right thing,  he would have done  the right thing, 
[00:44:00]  no matter what his  handlers were saying.  They worked together.  That's crap.  Look what they did  at BCN with the  Stone Temple Pilots.  They promote the hell  out of STP for, what,  a month or so.  They get the big show together  and then they're treated  like crap.  The band doesn't acknowledge  that the radio station  put the whole thing together.  They don't do any interviews  with the guys up there  in Boston.  And then when it comes time  for STP to hit the stage,  one of the perks of working  at the radio station,  you get to kind of hang out  on the side of the stage  and watch all the bands  as they're performing. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, no.  Not when STP is performing.  Everyone has to clear the area.  I'm so sick of bands  doing that to rock stations.  They're like,  ugh, get out of our way.  We know you promoted us  and all that,  but we don't want anything  to do with you.  Well, he did sign it.  Who spoke to you?  First, Bruce kind of went like this  because the interview was starting,  so I was like,  okay, that's fine.  And then the handler told me  he's not signing anything.  So I waited outside  as soon as he was done  and I just walked right up to him  and handed it to him 
[00:45:00]  with the marker  and then he finally signed it.  You know, Bruce Dickinson...  So I think he was  a bit of a dick, too.  At the very beginning, yeah,  but it was mostly his handler.  Look, Bruce Dickinson  back in the day  was very huge,  but at this point  he should be lucky  anyone is talking to him  on a radio station.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  The country's not filled  with brand new  Bruce Dickinson songs  being played.  People aren't running  to iTunes  to download  the latest  Bruce Dickinson song.  Stop with the attitude.  You're lucky that  this station here in New York  had you on. 
[00:45:30]  Eddie's a big monster.  He runs around.  He frightens everyone.  It's Big Eddie.  Well, he's got his  50th birthday today,  so the big 5-0  for Bruce Dickinson.  Good morning, Robert Kelly.  How are you?  Hey, Opie.  Hey, Anthony.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi.  It's nice to thank you  for having me in today.  I really appreciate it  and I'm a big fan.  What were you last night?  I wanted to go to a concert,  but you weren't around.  I had no one to go with you.  I had a bunch of things  I had to do last night  and I had a show last night.  Oh, you hate event.  Nice.  I had a show,  but I couldn't mention  the word retard at all. 
[00:46:00]  They kept saying it to me.  Don't say retard  because it was a fundraiser  for...  Retards.  Is that what it was?  It was a fun...  Oh, you were paid though, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was an event  to raise money  for mentally handicapped.  Just dopes.  Forget it.  So where was this...  Where was this...  This was at the  lovely comic strip  that I'm now working a lot,  which I...  So it was a paid event?  Yeah.  So it was basically...  What was it?  Bird Brains Inc. 
[00:46:30]  Wow.  I don't know.  I don't know if I can say it.  Am I allowed to say retard?  Of course you can say it.  We've been saying retard  forever.  Say retard.  We could still say that.  They'll take that away  from us eventually.  But Robert,  you're a huge Pats fan.  Yes, sir.  The big news,  the Jets got Brett Favre.  Ooh.  People are mad  because I'm not pronouncing  the V in Brett Favre's name.  How come you don't pronounce it?  A lot of people say Brett Favre.  I'm not the only one.  Brett Favre.  Really?  Yes.  Who says that?  I've heard Brett Favre.  I say Favre sometimes. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah?  Who gives a crap?  Like Jamie Favre?  From Magic?  Yeah, I guess.  How about Troy Aikman?  How about Tom Breda?  We got it.  We got it.  There are times a charm,  isn't it there?  Don't cancel me out of the fun,  okay, Mushy?  Yeah.  I'm sorry, Bob.  Yeah.  Let it be...  You're so nervous  about your nose operation.  You're right, Bob.  Let it be part of the fun today.  Jesus.  So what's the deal?  What are you thinking?  Nothing.  Exactly. 
[00:47:30]  I'm still not over Tom...  I'm still broken up  with Tom Brady,  but, you know,  hopefully we'll work it out  before the season starts.  Back together.  Tom Brady?  Are there contract problems?  No.  Me and him broke up last year.  He lost the Super Bowl.  Remember?  Treated him like his bitch.  You were talking about him  like he was a boyfriend of yours.  You're talking about him  like he wasn't.  We were together.  We met.  We met.  We made eye contact.  He's not bisexual like you. 
[00:48:00]  He's not...  We're not bisexual.  He's not gay.  It's not a gay thing, Opie.  It's a man thing.  It's a man like, you know...  Not how you were talking.  It's like a foster father thing.  Do we have that clip  of Bob Kelly  and his love for Tom Brady?  We put something together  back in the day, right?  Did you really?  Yes, we did.  Also, um...  Sure, we did.  Last night,  I actually finger-popped  my dog by accident.  You can't...  What?  Huh.  How do we handle that  on the regular radio? 
[00:48:30]  I don't know.  It just happened.  I just want to talk  to some of my therapists.  They have the month August off  and I have nobody to talk to.  So you're going to talk  to us about it?  How would you violate  your dog?  They might have dumped out.  Inadvertently.  Yeah, there was an oopsie  that happened with you  and your dog last night.  An oopsie.  Is that how you call it?  No, some kind of violation,  I would say, yeah.  Accidentally.  Accidentally.  By accident.  Violated your dog.  Well, you know,  I went over to hug my girl  and I had my index finger  came over first  and, uh... 
[00:49:00]  And the dog was what?  On the couch or something?  No, on the bed.  On the bed.  Lying, like,  just straight back.  And he didn't...  I mean, it's funny, though.  Dogs are just...  just ready to be raped.  They really do nothing.  All out of them.  There's nothing.  Yeah, there's nothing.  They don't, like...  They don't jump or get shocked.  He just kind of  picks his head up  and looks vertically  down his long body.  Yeah, but if I had a dog  and I did an oopsie  and it didn't jump,  I'd be very suspicious  of what's going on  when you're not in the house.  Because...  That's when he is in the house. 
[00:49:30]  But no dog.  Do it to any dog.  No dog is ever...  You go near a dog's anything.  It doesn't shake  or move around.  It just sits there  and looks at you like,  yeah, go ahead.  You know what?  I can't take  dogs in the bed  and on the couch.  It's just...  Because they...  All their nasties  are just out there  in the breeze  to get into your fabric  where you lay your face.  You're in bed  with your dog.  Obviously,  if you go over  to hug your girl  and inadvertently  violate your dog, 
[00:50:00]  that part of your dog  is up high enough  where at moments  when you move around  the bed a little,  your face is probably  right where certain parts  were just laying  on the sheets.  Yeah, and sometimes  when your dog goes out,  you know,  they got hair back there.  Right.  And then it stays in  and then it jumps in the bed.  Oh, until they get on the bed  or the couch  or anything else  and make your furniture stink.  I told you one night  I was lying in bed  and I thought...  I was lying there  and I grabbed my girl...  She was my girlfriend  at the time.  I was like,  there's a ghost in the room. 
[00:50:30]  And she's like,  what are you talking about?  There's something  in the room right now  touching me.  And I was...  She was like,  what happened?  She turned the light on.  The dog was peeing  on my leg.  Oh, my God.  I thought there was a ghost  because I felt my whole body  and my leg getting warm.  I was like,  oh, my God.  It's a ghost  or I'm having a stroke  or something.  Why was the dog  doing that?  Why was the dog...  It was when Kelby  was a baby  when we first got him.  I forgot we even had  a dog.  I'm just lying there  like,  oh, God.  I'm being touched  by a ghost. 
[00:51:00]  What a hell being.  Hot dog.  That's amazing.  Also,  this day in history,  something we've talked  about a lot  on this show,  34 years ago today,  Jimmy,  Philippe Petit,  a guy we used to like  until we interviewed him,  did his thing  across the Twin Towers,  that tightrope thing  he did.  How do we say his name?  What does he say  we said his name wrong?  Is it Philippe Petit?  We said Philippe Petit  and he said  that was wrong.  How is it?  It's Philippe Petit.  I think you gotta  get a little more...  Screw him and his name.  You gotta get more  faggy when you say it. 
[00:51:30]  There you go.  Philip?  Was it Philip?  No.  I'm just angry.  I love it.  It has to be like  Philippe Petit.  Like, we weren't  like, you know,  giving it enough  enough French  for his taste.  It comes out  like the joker's rage.  Philippe Petit!  Oz Teep.  Stunt brain saw  men on wire  and he was  doing his imitation  of Philippe Petit  under the tarp.  Remember that whole  thing about the tarp?  He went on and on  about the dumb tarp.  Dude, that 45 minute 
[00:52:00]  hunk of the movie  where he was talking  about the tarp  and we did not know  it, but we got it.  We know you made  the walks, stupid ass.  We've seen the photos.  Basically, they had  to hide under a tarp  because there was  like a security guard  going back and forth  and they weren't sure  if the security guard  was still in the room  so they stayed  under the tarp  way longer than  they probably had to  and then he just  over explains it  in the movie, right?  You want to do  your impression there?  It was just creepy  to me because he kept  saying, and then 
[00:52:30]  my foot was in his arm  and his arm was up  by my head  and we got to know  each other very well.  It was just really creepy.  It really was homoerotic  and a lot of man parts  touching and he was  going for dramatic effect  but the end result  is not a mystery.  We know what happened.  Yeah.  The movie's getting  good reviews,  really good reviews.  So, you know,  I question why he was  like giving his buddy  there, you know, 
[00:53:00]  piggyback rides  and rolling around  in the grass  when they were  practicing for the  big tightrope walk.  Steve from Bayshore,  it's pronounced  French prick.  Oh, okay.  Let's say hi to Dan-O.  Dan-O.  Hey, Bob.  Yes, sir.  Hey, I was just wondering,  man, was it a ghost  or was it a werewolf,  you retard?  A werewolf.  All right, all right.  Robert Kelly's going to be 
[00:53:30]  at the Treehouse Comedy  Club in Trumbull.  Trumbull.  Trumbull, Connecticut.  Only Saturday.  Only Saturday,  one show,  unless a lot of you guys  show up,  then we'll do two.  Oh, that would be cool.  TreehouseComedy.com  for info.  TreehouseComedy.com.  Yeah, exactly.  All right, it makes it  very easy.  Thank you, Opie.  Hey, we got a story  that we didn't get to  yesterday that's worth  playing today.  A woman doesn't  understand why she  sees a rainbow  in her sprinkler.  What?  Who is this dunce?  We had a dummy 
[00:54:00]  yesterday.  We all remember this  from yesterday, right?  They was talking  over a barrel.  They was up there  at a barrel that day  they didn't have no  barrel.  And they won a barrel.  They were hanging  around to get a barrel.  The mailman gave me a  dollar.  They were talking  over a barrel.  They probably took  this barrel and  shot him.  No.  The beer we have,  it drank pretty good.  No.  Mellow.  No.  Mellow.  What did you?  What?  Enough about the beer. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, my.  Wow.  And then there's  Coors, too.  He says Coors.  Yeah, we don't have  Coors.  I got to get Coors  on here, too.  Wait.  The beer we have,  it drank pretty good.  Budweiser.  What's the name  of some of them  other beers?  Budweiser and  what is it?  Mellow.  Miller.  Coors.  Coors.  It drank pretty good,  though.  They was talking  over a barrel.  They was in there.  They didn't want a barrel.  And they were in a  barrel.  They were hanging  around to get a  barrel.  The mailman gave me  my dollar.  They were talking  over a barrel.  They probably took  this barrel and  shot him. 
[00:55:00]  I just saw that  the other day.  Oh, God, is that  a great movie?  When he's trying to  make it like he has  breasts, he's just  trying to be her  as she screams.  She just screams.  She sees the  fingernails in the  walls of the well  she's in and starts  screaming, and he's  just like trying to  scream like her.  That's fantastic.  Yeah, he pulls his  shirt out like he's  got two muscles.  Like he's got breasts. 
[00:55:30]  Trying to be her?  One of the best  ghouls in movie  history, that guy.  He's the sergeant  on Monk now.  I just can't even  watch the show.  It's so funny to see  him pop up in  anything now, because  you just think,  would you?  You need some help?  Would you?  And then in the  Hills Have Eyes,  when he crashes the  truck and his son-in-law  or something says,  well, can you fix it?  And obviously the  truck is trashed.  And he just looks  at him and goes,  what?  It's the best one 
[00:56:00]  word.  He can do one word,  great.  What?  Buckle a little bit  with a creep.  Oh, yeah.  It reminds me of the  song one of the  listeners did.  I forgot his name.  I want to give him  credit, the down in the  hole thing he did.  Oh, yeah.  About that movie?  Yeah.  Huh?  John S.  Oh, that's right.  John S.  I'm drawing a blank.  The movie.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  I'm slow today. 
[00:56:30]  I got beat up by a  dumb trainer yesterday.  I'm exhausted.  You had a trainer?  I have a bad wing,  so we're doing a little  physical therapy.  Oh, I got one of those,  too.  And I'm getting the  crap beat out of me  by this trainer.  Is it a guy or a girl?  It's a girl.  Ooh.  Is she hot?  She's pregnant there,  Robert.  So she's hot.  I would say she's,  yeah, she's definitely  hot, but she's pregnant.  Don't you like that?  No.  That was for the radio.  Oh, was it?  Oh, I didn't know.  I thought we were all  honest on the show.  You probably liked her. 
[00:57:00]  She's probably doing  stuff with little  tinker sweats.  Underpants are tenting.  Here's those old 1978  shorts that come way high.  They have no  Skiduchi protector.  Just hanging out.  I do have a thing for  pregnant women.  I said Skiduchi.  What are you going to do?  I do have a thing for  pregnant women, but I  don't want to have sex  with pregnant women.  I can't really explain it.  I get a bit of a tingle  when I see that.  Do you like the little  pushed out belly button?  No.  It's just something.  I don't know what it is.  I don't want to have 
[00:57:30]  actual sex with it.  With it.  With it.  With it.  I'm not into that type  of porn or any of that  crap, but if I see a  pregnant woman walking  down the street, yeah,  it kind of is a bit of a  turn up.  Would you like her to  hold your head and kind  of let your head and feed  you?  I swear to God, none of  that crap.  I don't know what it is.  Do you want to feel  like a little baby hand  on the helmet?  Yeah.  Grab it like an apple?  I'm so sorry for the  pregnant women out there,  but it's just my personal  dopey opinion.  It is the worst time for a  woman.  It is. 
[00:58:00]  It is the worst.  They're not attractive.  Yeah.  People are like, oh, man,  you got to see my wife's  pregnant.  She's got the greatest  cans on her now.  It's like, no.  You ever see pregnant  women's breasts?  They become, I don't know  what happens.  They fall, first of all.  Yeah.  They fall a bit.  And then a discoloration  happens.  I've seen pictures.  This discoloration happens.  Anthony's saying, I've seen  pictures.  I've seen pictures.  I've seen pictures?  I've actually seen it in  real life.  I've seen it in real life  in our studio at NEW when 
[00:58:30]  that woman came when we  tried to induce labor on a  pregnant woman and had to  run up and down the stairs.  What?  You had to do jumping  jacks.  Like we know what the hell  we were talking about for a  second.  You know what you just did?  See, they were much better  back in the day.  Yeah.  The fact is, we can't do  half this stuff anymore.  We're not allowed to.  We had her doing jumping  jacks, running up and  down stairs.  We had her have sex with  her husband in another 
[00:59:00]  studio because we heard  that could, you know,  get the baby a movie.  What happened to those  days?  Sounds fun.  The times, they have a  change, my friend.  Yeah.  No one was watching us  back then.  We got away with murder.  You mean you can't  possibly kill a pregnant  woman anymore?  Just proves my point.  They were way better  back in the day.  I told you.  That's when they did  like cutting edge stuff.  See, look, there's the  girl.  She was nine months to the 
[00:59:30]  day.  I think she was a couple  days over her due date  and she was frustrated.  So she came in.  We're looking at a naked  picture of her.  I'm sure we can't get this  picture up on  Oh, that's the one.  Look at that.  Maybe we can if we do a  little pixelation action.  And then we had her doing  all sorts of stuff to get  the baby out live on our  show.  Apparently the arm with the  razor doesn't reach anymore.  Can you just imagine  around 18 years from now  this kid surfing the  insane internet and just  coming across that picture  of his mom.  his mom in the studio next  to Opie naked. 
[01:00:00]  Be realistic.  How old is that kid right  now?  Probably seven.  Yeah.  Probably six or seven.  Probably six.  I think that was at the  end of our run.  I like how big and dark  they get around the middle  of it.  With the no thing.  No.  I like that.  No.  No, you don't.  Yeah, I do.  No, you don't.  Jimmy.  But you're acting like  Jimmy doesn't like weird  stuff already.  Nine years old.  The kid's nine years  old.  Get the F out of here.  Nine years old.  This is from November  8th, 1999.  What? 
[01:00:30]  How old are we?  Jesus.  This kid's already  surfing porn.  Exactly.  I want to redo this bit  by the way.  Oh, really?  Yeah, let's get another  girl and let's get her to  have a kid live on our  show.  Let's have a fat guy sit  on his stomach and see  if it pops out.  The kid's nine years  old now.  We're not allowed to  have a woman show  breasts.  Yeah, how are we going  to get a girl to give  birth on our show?  Just push it out.  We were so damn close  back then too.  We thought we had it  going.  Geez.  All right, what do you  want to do?  We've got to take a break.  We've got the production 
[01:01:00]  piece where Robert Kelly  says he loves Tom Brady  or we've got the  Down in the Hole song  that John S.  John S. did  about Silence of the Lambs.  That's kind of cool.  You want to check that out?  We have to play that in a while?  I do like that.  All right, take a listen  to this and we'll continue  with Robert Kelly.  Also, Mike Birbiglia  coming in here to talk  about what happened to him  this past Saturday  at our comedy show.  And Louis Black.  I'm actually leaving.  Wow.  I have to go to my agents. 
[01:01:30]  I have to meet my agents today.  I have to go and do that  run through in the office  and this is blah, blah, blah.  Wait, but when do they  expect you to do that?  Today.  At what time?  I have to be there  at 1130.  Where's your agents?  Paradigm 20.  Why am I telling you all this?  Why do you have to leave?  Because we're gone by 11.  Yeah, but I got to go home.  I got to shower.  I got to put a nice shirt on.  Tell your agents this.  Wait, hang on.  I'm helping.  You're helping me.  Can you fix your ear  before you help me?  Why? 
[01:02:00]  I don't know.  Just one flapping ear  sticking out.  I can hear.  I know, but it just looks weird  looking at your ear  is just flapping out.  I like to have an ear free.  I like to have both ears  confined by headphones.  But that's you.  You can perform.  I don't.  I'm a marshmallow beat.  The agents will understand.  If you tell them  you're a little late  or you're unshowered.  I know this, Jim.  I'm doing an important radio show.  Yeah.  Agent.  Perhaps this will help,  you know.  Help what?  I've done it 9,000 times.  I'm still the fat nothing  that I was 
[01:02:30]  the first time I was on the show.  They were never nice to me.  You don't like them?  No.  They love you.  They don't love me.  Yeah, they do.  I talk to them all the time.  Why didn't they love me  when I was with them?  They love you now.  Exactly.  Back then it was a different person.  Everybody loves you now  when you're doing okay.  Yeah.  When they didn't love you then,  Bobbo.  Yeah, okay.  I'm realistic.  Now, who's your agent?  Pete from AGI.  Oh, Pete's your agent?  Like television and film?  Queer Pete, yeah.  Gay Pete with the thin legs?  Yeah.  Who wears the shorts  on the virus tour?  Italian Pete  who's got that sexy smile. 
[01:03:00]  He's got that tattoo  of a heart  on his left cheek.  What are you going to do?  Once in a while  you might want a fake laugh.  I'd do it at you.  He's got a little  helicopter pad on his ass  just for landing.  See?  All right.  No stopping here.  Mine bombed  and you decided  to do it again?  Fast Freddy writes,  Bobby saying  we got to get a fat guy  is really funny.  Oh, I'm not fat anymore,  Fast Freddy,  and I'd love to see  a picture of you,  you fat nothing.  There you go.  And someone from their  cell phone writes,  opiate is turned down  by pregnant women  because it's proof 
[01:03:30]  they have sex.  Maybe that's it.  I don't know.  I don't want to have  sex with them,  I swear.  It's just a weird thing.  Hey, let's do the  Silence of the Lambs song  from John S.  Done to Alice in Chains  down in the hole.  Listen to this.  Opie and Anthony.  Can you help me  put this in my van?  Would you?  With my broken arm,  I don't think I can.  I have been guilty 
[01:04:00]  of murdering girls  that are fat.  You're on my list now,  what do you think about that?  You're down in a hole,  yeah,  and I'm in control.  You're down in a hole 
[01:04:30]  Cause I hate my poor  I like to tuck  I like to tuck  in my junk  Frederica  Great big fat person  You're down in a hole

[01:07:00]  What the heck  Is in our water supply  What the heck  Is in our oxygen supply  Of the metallic  Is there an oxygen supply  Supply  Mixed in with some other stuff  But  Jesus  Of the metallic oxide salts  That create a rainbow effect  In a sprinkler  Come on  This has to be a gag  She really can't figure it out 
[01:07:30]  And she thinks  It's some kind of impurity  Well yeah  She thinks she's seen God  Obviously  Because she had to date  The whole video  August 6  4 o'clock  2008  This is it  Right  That create  A rainbow effect  In a sprinkler  What is oozing  Out of our ground  That allows  This type of effect  To happen  Not just around  Our sun  And our moon  Anymore  Everywhere we look  The visible spectrum 
[01:08:00]  Is rainbows  This cannot be natural  We all know  It wasn't something  That happened  20 years ago  But now  It's happening now  We as a nation  Have got to ask ourselves  What the hell  Is going on  Well  What is oozing 
[01:08:30]  Out of our ground  She's actually right  Really Jim  Yeah  Because there's phosphorus  In the water  Is that it  And what does that do  Yeah  I don't know  The physical makeup  But it does  It does have  Something to do  It  The only time  A rainbow is bad  If it's in meat  Yeah exactly  You don't want to see  Rainbow on your ham  Things like that  Or steak  Or roast beef  That's where rainbows  Are bad  What's it mean  But that  Look at it 
[01:09:00]  You see that all the time  The mist  From the water  And that's why  Regular rainbows are made  It refracts the light  Dumbies it up  Into the  Spectrum  That light has  You know  The regular white light  Is a bunch of colors  And when  When you  Divvy those colors up  They come up  As the colors  Of the rainbow  And water  Acts like  Almost like a prism  Where it  Refracts the light 
[01:09:30]  And breaks it up  Into  Various different  Colors  Anthony  How do you know that?  Discovery Channel  Forget Aristotle  And fuck Socrates  Here comes  Professor  Anthony  I like that static  What happened  Guy's wet mouth  There's a rainbow  Going on in his mouth  That's one of my favorite  Little things we play though  Of course  A prism  As soon as you said

[01:14:00]  Well I'll let you guys tell me yourself  Oof  Alright  Nice  Hey is she a therapist?  She's a  She's horrible  I thought all therapists take the month of August off  Well she's not working now  She's on the phone  Are you not working now?  Her clump smells like sauerkraut on a scalp  Oh  Lydia hold on  We'll try to figure it out  You come down whenever you want  My therapist is off for two weeks now  Oh no Jimmy  Yeah  What does that mean?  Nothing I'll be fine  You sure? 
[01:14:30]  You sure?  Yeah  Why are you looking at us like that?  I'm scared  Aww  This week won't matter  Because I'll be  I'll have my procedure the week after  I think they do that  Just to make sure you're messed up for the whole year  They just take a  They get you nice and healthy  And then  Alright I'm out  And they just leave you for a month  By the end of the month  Prove that they don't really give a crap about you  And your dumb problems  Yeah yeah  Go to Vermont and write your stupid book  That's never going to get published  They got to take vacations  Are you on a therapist that never takes a break  Listening to these loans all day?  It's called a vacation  Can you get a  Friday, Saturday, Sunday 
[01:15:00]  But you don't take a vacation from your problems Jimmy  It's true  So let's say you need her  Can you get a hold of her if you had to?  No but this is how good  See that's why  It's all BS  My doctor is  This bitch said that  If I need help  She actually has a couple of people  If I call her machine  That I can call an emergency other therapist  It's like a  It's like a  A pull string  And a kook doctor  Falls in the ceiling  My doctor actually gave me his cell number  Where he's going to be 
[01:15:30]  So if I need him  I can just call him directly  We've been going in for a long time  See that's the way it should be right there  No who wants  I actually want to go up there like  What about Bob  And just spend the whole summer  How great is that movie?  It's great  It really is a funny movie  And my name's Bob too  So it'd kind of work out  Ah boy  Tie it all in  Let's say hi to Tim in Boston  Tim  I just wanted to know  If Steve told you guys  That that woman with the rainbow clip was real  Because it sounds so authentic  It's fake  I gotta tell you  It sounds real  It just sounds like a dumb woman  Yeah she's 
[01:16:00]  All right  Yeah she just does sound like quite a dummy  Who cares if it's real  You guys aren't reporting the news  You're just trying to have fun  Oh by the way  There is a video  Yes and that will be linked on  OwenDayRadio.com  Yes Danny  If anybody's doubting that  That's real  It's absolutely real  This lady has her own YouTube channel  There's probably about 35-40 videos of her  Just being as stupid as she is in this video  Yeah  There's one where she's looking at the moon  And she doesn't understand why there's light on the moon  Like she just can't grasp the fact that perhaps 
[01:16:30]  Light is bouncing off the sun hitting the moon  Like she thinks there's something in the moon that's illuminating  Oh that's making the moon play  All right now I'm starting to think it's fake  No you cannot be walking around breathing and thinking stuff like that  I have a light switch in my house  If I turn it off the moon shuts off actually  Show me  Play another clip from her then  Yeah give me the moon clip  Get the moon one  Because you know what now I've got to go with that last caller  I'm starting to think this is her thing  I've got to hear the moon one  Everyone's trying to find their thing  That's going to make them famous on the old YouTube 
[01:17:00]  Hey can we play the pot of gold?  Yeah  It reminds us of the old  The gold  Well it's honestly this probably is our favorite thing ever  The leprechaun story  Curiosity leads to large crowds in Mobile's Crichton community  Many of you bringing binoculars, camcorders, even camera phones to take pictures  To me it looks like a leprechaun to me  I got to look up in the tree  Who else in the leprechaun say yeah?  Yeah!  Eyewitnesses say the leprechaun only comes out at night 
[01:17:30]  If you shine a light in its direction it suddenly disappears  This amateur sketch resembles what many of you say the leprechaun looks like  Others find it hard to believe and have come up with their own theories and explanations for the image  My theory is it's casting a shadow  From the other man  Could be a crackhead that got hold to the wrong stuff  And it told him to get up in the tree and play a leprechaun 
[01:18:00]  We're going to get down to the bottom of this  You're still on there guy don't be afraid  Don't be afraid man  This guy helping to direct traffic says he's prepared for his encounter with the leprechaun  He's suited up from head to toe  This was all smells right here  This is a special leprechaun flute  Which has been passed down from thousands of years ago  From my great great grandfather who was Irish  And I just came to help out  Others just came to get lucky  And hopes a pot of gold may be buried under this tree 
[01:18:30]  I'm going to run a backhoe and uproot that tree  I want to know where the gold at  I want the gold  Give me the gold  I want the gold  I want to know where the gold at  Give me the gold  That never gets old  My great great grandfather who was Irish  He's also called slave owner  You don't like him until they have a magical flute  My favorite moment is he goes  This guy directing traffic  Directing traffic  Just some kook with a flute 
[01:19:00]  Directing traffic  He doesn't work for the state  He's dressed from head to toe  Getting ready for the leprechaun  He's ready for a leprechaun encounter  But while he's waiting  He'll direct traffic  What a loon  What an ass  Whenever he does it with his flute  Go  They was out of a barrel  They was up there  They had a barrel  They didn't have no barrel  And they won a barrel  They were hanging around to get a barrel  Cause the mailman gave my dog  I was just  They were out of a barrel  They probably took his barrel  And then shot him  I know we're going with that old gag today 
[01:19:30]  But can we do Boo Got Shot too  I love Boo Got Shot  You ever hear Boo Got Shot, Robert?  Yeah, I think I have  I forget it though  There's another version of it too  Where there's a translation  But we don't want the translation one  No  It's an eyewitness  You're going to have yourself  This lady witnessed a murder  Or a shooting  And basically Boo Got Shot  She was shaking real bad  They got shot 
[01:20:00]  They got shot  I said, who, who?  She said, Boo Got Shot  Boo Got Shot  I said, oh my god  Oh my god  We just saw it  My suicide called somebody  She called my cousin  Punkin  She called her  And Punkin told her  That she was on the phone  With Pauline  And she had left out  And she went and got in her car  She bailed out  And when she left out  When I heard the gunshot again  When I heard the gunshot  And I seen some boy  Had running  The building over  Bet that way  He ran in that building  And I seen that car  That flew off  And then I seen a long gun 
[01:20:30]  A big old gun  In the car  I love the dated girl  I like that accent  I kind of like it  Just to go  What'd you say  Every couple minutes  That's another planet  I want to bring  One of those home  To Thanksgiving dinner  Wouldn't that be awesome  That would be really funny  To just like  A girl like that  You bring her home  Thanksgiving dinner  With the whole family  Introduce her  Whatever her name is  And then she just  Starts going off  Yeah let me tell you  Life  I got the  Bull shot 
[01:21:00]  Bull shot  Oh really  That's great  At the building  At the building  I live in  And then punk  It would be the first year  You don't have to throw  You don't have to throw  The dark meat away  You see my family  Just go  What did she say  That's great  Yeah that's good  All trying to be polite  So would you like  Some turkey  Turkey  I ain't never had  No turkey like this  Before  You want gravy  Gravy  You got some pumpkin pie  You know my cousin  Ain't pumpkin 
[01:21:30]  They're all just looking  At you like  What the hell  Are you doing  He's not my real cousin  Wow  That turns me  I like that accent  I want to date a chick  I understand everything  My wife says  I don't want that  One of my cousins  Brought  Actually married a black guy  Oh boy  And  That's not good in your family  Brought him over  That's not a good thing  Nice enough guy  Really  He was  Nice guy  He was  What happened  Well  I think they split up  Oh boy 
[01:22:00]  But you know  They had kids  And everything  And  They would come over  You know  The grandparents house  Where we'd have Christmas  And Thanksgiving  And stuff  And  I don't know  People would  Would say things  Behind their back  Yeah  Of course  It was like  Well her name  Her name was  Jackie  So they would say  Here comes Jackie  And  You know  Jackie  Yes 
[01:22:30]  So  Before they would come in  It was like  Oh here comes Jackie  And you know  Rhymes with  Key  Rhymes with  Yes  Yes  Yeah  Okay  So it was very  Hackey  She was dating Rich Voss  Jackie and Hackey  Yes  Yes  Logan  724  Alright  That is the exact thing  They would say  If we're doing secret messages  Thank you to Dave L  Oh

[01:23:30]  Alright  That's why it's on the news by the way  There are probably plenty of coherent people  Talking about the leprechaun  I think there was a bit once  I think it was on MADtv  And it was a black gentleman in a suit  Very well educated  And he was a witness to a crime  Or some accident  Something that had happened  And the press walked up to him  And got two seconds of him talking 
[01:24:00]  And then turned away  And went to the first lunatic black person  That they could find  Where they were just like  Oh my god  All of a sudden  The car came in  And the guy's standing there going  Excuse me  I saw this  I would like to comment on it  But they wouldn't go to the educated  Articulate black guy  You so want to listen to a black eyewitness  Over a white eyewitness  Oh yeah  They're very emotional  Oh yeah  I love it  This is a good white trash witness  Those are fun too 
[01:24:30]  Yeah  I saw it  With my own eyes  He came out and just stabbed him  Really?  You got the UPS clip  Oh he's right over there  Alright  Mr. Rock  Uh what?  Tank  Oh  Who's Tank?

Hey, good morning, Mike  I just want to say  I went to the virus show  Saturday night  Yeah  I had a blast  I bought a Bob Kelly  And a Rich Voss CD  My wife just can't buy  Into the whole virus thing  She said  That's funny  That's funny 
[01:31:30]  So I made a list  Of the CD  In the car  On the way out  On the weekend  She was laughing her ass  Off to Kelly  She thinks she's hysterical  Now she'll listen  To the show  Oh, very cool  Thanks a lot, Bobby  I'm glad  You're talking about my CD  Not Voss's, right?  Well, I had to buy Voss  Because he was standing there  But he was absolutely  Yeah, Voss does force  People to buy his stuff  He just stands there  What about me?  Yeah, he says  What about me?  Exactly  But Bobby signed it  It was the greatest  And he even called me  By my name  He's the best 
[01:32:00]  All right, right on, Rob  Thanks for listening to the show  Just a tip on iTunes, right, Robert?  Just a tip on iTunes, yeah  And just go to  TreehouseComedy.com  For Robert Kelly's show  In Trumbull  Trumbull, Connecticut  Trumbull  Trumbull, Connecticut  This Saturday night  Okay  We got more sprinkler lady  With the moon  Is this one the moon?  Yeah  Because we just played a clip  She thinks something's going on  Because she saw a rainbow  In her sprinkler  She thinks there's something  Wrong with the water  And the oxygen 
[01:32:30]  She can't really figure out  How rainbows are made  I'm starting to think  That this could be her thing  That she's making believe  She's this stupid  A phony  So we asked for another clip  And now we got her  Talking about the moon  Okay  Sprinkler lady  Talking about the moon  Danny, are you buying into this?  Absolutely  Really?  Yeah, if you look at her  If you look at her other videos  Like she's just  She's clearly a lunatic  Okay  She's just a lunatic person  Okay, it's July 4th  That's the moon  Why am I able to see 
[01:33:00]  A complete full moon  And then  The quarter moon  If you look at that  Parameters  That moon  Would not be equal  The circle  Compared to that light  So that light  Is behind it  So how can a light  Be behind the moon?  Basically what she's describing  Wow  She's seeing 
[01:33:30]  She's seeing a full moon  A darkly  A dark full moon  And then there is  A shine  Like a crescent  On the side  So she doesn't understand  Why if she sees  A full moon  Why is there also  A crescent moon  And she says  It's not equal  She's like  If you put it together  It's not one full circle  What she's not understanding  Is that  There's something called  Planet shine  And like  There's light  That's actually being reflected  On the dark side  Of the moon  And she can't just  Grasp the fact  That there could  Potentially be light 
[01:34:00]  Behind the moon  Oh my god  She is an idiot  She just fails to grasp  The simplest  Of scientific notions  What I love  Is her confidence  In what she's saying  Yeah yeah  She completely is like  Hey  I know  It's not even  I had to edit that  Together a little bit  Because there's a lot of silence  And she likes to insert  A lot of title cards  And on one of her title cards  She suggests that  She might be looking at  A hologram  Of the moon  Because she couldn't  She can't figure out  Why else there would be  Light behind the moon 
[01:34:30]  So it must be a hologram  Unbelievable  What a dope  What else does she talk about  On that website  Or  She's  She's  A lot of videos  In regards to like  Energy  And like these weird energies  That like the government  Is putting out  To you know  Okay  To keep  Yeah exactly  Yeah  Very good  Going backwards  The virus show  Mike Birbiglia is coming in  To talk about his experience  Ooh  He didn't have the same experience  That Jim Norton had  Or Robert Kelly had  No  And we're going to get into it 
[01:35:00]  In about 15 minutes  With Mr. Birbiglia  Birbiglia  Alright  Ben Stein was on  Larry King last night  Oh  Ben Stein  I was watching  Planes, Trains, and Automobiles  Again  And  And then Ben Stein  Pops up in the movie  And I just get angry  I just  Yeah  I just don't like this guy  Boy he's a very intelligent guy  Yeah  Is he great  Good for him  He's a nice  I met him once too  He's a nice guy  He's not nice  No he was to me  Yes he was  He was very nice to me 
[01:35:30]  When I did tough crowd with him twice  But he's still a douche  I don't like him  I don't like him at all  I don't either  I mean  He hung up on us  Because he thought we were being racist  Or something  He thought we were being anti-Semitic  I said  What's up Jew  And I remember that  Yeah he thought it was  I remember that booking too  We were doing him a favor  There's times we're on the fence with people  Like  Alright we'll give him a shot  Like  We don't need Ben Stein on our radio show  We do  And all of a sudden  Anthony's doing a live read  And he's talking about chewing down  So yeah 
[01:36:00]  They don't go  It was like some car dealership  It's like  Oh they were  You know  You don't have to go down there  And try to chew down the price  It was a Bieber theme too  That was not just  Yeah  To chew down the thing  It was a whole Bieber thing  So there was a whole bunch of  Bieber type of references  Yeah  In a copy  Yeah  We got the actual clip  Oh we do  I don't think we've played this in years  Right  Wow  Alright this is what we're getting at  This is how obnoxious he gets  Yeah  But right now we gotta say hi to  Ben Stein Anthony  Ben Stein  Hey Ben  Hold on hold on  And that's me trying to sell the fact 
[01:36:30]  We have Ben Stein on the show  I could care less  And I figured the listeners  Were like yeah whatever  So I was really trying to pump it up  Trying to get some energy going  But right now we gotta say hi to  Ben Stein Anthony  Ben Stein  Hey Ben  Hi how are you  There he is  Did I just hear you do an ad  Where you said somebody was gonna  Chew down the price of a car  No we said chew down  You just said chew down  Oh that's a lot different  We wouldn't say chew down on a commercial  We would say it during the show 
[01:37:00]  But not during a paid advertisement Ben  Okay  You being of Jewish background  I would take it Ben  Yeah of course  And if we were gonna say something like that  We certainly wouldn't say it just before we talked to Ben Stein  Talked to Ben Stein  I see  You sure fooled me  Oh my god  Are we gonna get off on a bad foot with Ben Stein right from the start  Well I really think that's a jackass thing to do  But we said chew down  Well it sounds just like chew down  Oh my god  Well I mean come on that's a crappy thing to do 
[01:37:30]  That's just an absolutely explicit invitation to racism  Well it's a term that is used  Chew  Not Jew  I wouldn't have said Jew down  Chew down  You know you'd say like a beaver  Would go at a tree  He would chew down the tree  Well it sounds just like Jew down  And anybody who's listening to it is gonna know  You're saying Jew down  With a tiny tiny change in the accent 
[01:38:00]  It sounds like chew down  Oh my god Ben  Are you this insane  Are you actually this insanely crazy  That you're arguing over chew or Jew down  Hello Ben  I think you just hung up  Ben Stein just hung up  I got hung up on by Ben Stein  First of all yes you would say that Anthony  Well not during a commercial read  And you were reading copy  You didn't make that up  No I did  No of course I was reading copy  Chew down was in the copy  Chew down is not Jew down 
[01:38:30]  It's not an anti-semitic term  You could chew something down  You're nibbling  You're chewing down something  Does it sound like Jew down?  Sorry  The copy was probably written  To put that  But again you didn't write the copy  Yeah  And it was the theme  It was probably  In a way he was probably right  Like that probably was the intent  But it wasn't your intent  You were just the guy reading the copy  It wasn't the intent  They're two different things  He's too oversensitive 
[01:39:00]  To that whole thing  Chewing down something  Is  It has nothing to do with  Saying Jew down  It's a self-important ass  So I  From that point on  I hate Ben Stein  I've never heard  Chew down for anything  I'm glad his  Son had to  Go to rehab  For video games  Oh yeah  Oh my god  He was playing EverQuest  His son  To the point where  He wasn't doing anything  He was waking up  At three in the morning  To get on  Ben Stein would wake up  In tears 
[01:39:30]  Why are you playing that game  And had to send him to rehab  And told him he couldn't use the computer anymore  So he'd wake up  And at two in the morning  His son's on the computer  Playing EverQuest  And then he came out  Against these games  Saying that they're addictive  And horrible  And ruining kids' lives  Shut up  Yeah  He's against Star Wars  You're really saying  Chewbacca  Chewbacca  Isn't that  Chewbacca 
[01:40:00]  Yes  He doesn't like  Chewing gum  No  What a nerd  Well he was on  Larry King last night  Did you say  The Jew  The Proud  The Marines  No it's the  Do you spell  Julie Andrews  With an EW  He's a little sensitive  Yeah  He hung up way too quick  Yeah  Cause I said  He's insane  You should have kept arguing  His point  Yeah he didn't like the part  Where you called him insane  I don't like him now either  Thank you RobertKelleyLive.com

[01:41:30]  I didn't make up  How did I get this reputation  I like the era  You don't like the era  Yeah sure you do  Yeah  You like the boots  No one's buying that  You like the goose step  No I don't goose step  It's not a very energy economic way of walking  It's very tiring  It's hell on your back  Yes  Your legs  Stunt brain  Give me the set up here  So Ben Stein was on Larry King last night  And he's disgusted by the Paris Hilton political ads  What do we got on that  Paris Hilton did what 
[01:42:00]  A goof ad  Well some guys wrote a  Sorry Bobby  I didn't mean to interrupt your texting  Oh no you didn't  Oh yeah  But Paris did that response to the John McCain ad  They did a kind of a clever ad  Where she gave an energy policy  And told us why she should be a good candidate  And then said I'll see you at the debate bitches  And apparently Ben  Why are you smelling stunt brain  To this  What are you doing 
[01:42:30]  I look like Tom Brady  Did McCain make  He put her in an ad somehow  Well he used a picture of her  And Paris Hilton  To associate Barack Obama's popularity  With celebrity status  Okay so she responded  And some guys wrote a clever ad  And shot a pretty funny  It was actually pretty good  It was everywhere the last couple days  On the news  Too bad McCain shouldn't have used the image  If he didn't want her to have it  Well you know what it was  It was trying to use the image  That Barack's a celebrity  Right  He's like a rock star  But that doesn't necessarily mean 
[01:43:00]  He's qualified to be president  And showing how there are other celebrities  That absolutely aren't qualified to be president  So they showed Paris Hilton  Well she's being used as the  The antonym of anything qualified  Right  Because she's an idiot  It's a dummy  It's all hype  That his whole popularity  Is just based on nothing  And McCain actually responded to her ad  Saying he thought it was brilliant  He thought it was hilarious  Oh see  This is Paris responding to McCain's ad  He's the oldest celebrity in the world  Like super old 
[01:43:30]  Old enough to remember  When dancing was a sin  And beer was served in a bucket  But is he ready to lead?  Hey America  I'm Paris Hilton  And I'm a celebrity too  Only I'm not from the olden days  And I'm not promising change  Like that other guy  I'm just hot  But then that wrinkly white haired guy  Used me in his campaign ad  Which I guess means  I'm running for president  So thanks for the endorsement  White haired dude  And I want America to know 
[01:44:00]  That I'm like  Totally ready to lead  That's cool  She's having a little fun with it  I can't stand the way she talks  No  I got it just  Ugh  Yeah well  Rick Solomon didn't like it either  So he filled her mouth  Saw the video  It's not even that hot too  I actually saw her butt  At a club in Vegas  Yeah  It's just  Her legs just attached  To the back of her back  Just  There's no ass whatsoever 
[01:44:30]  Really?  Nothing  Nothing  It looks like a spaded shovel  And now I want to present  My energy policy for America  Just as soon as I finish  Reading this article  And where I can fight her  To get the best hand  Oh  Maui  Loves it  Okay  So here's my energy policy  Barack wants to focus  On new technologies  To cut foreign oil dependency  And McCain wants  Offshore drilling  Well why don't we do  A hybrid of both  Candidates' ideas  We can do limited 
[01:45:00]  Offshore drilling  With strict environmental oversight  While creating tax incentives  To get Detroit  Making hybrid  And electric cars  That way  The offshore drilling  Carries us until  The new technologies  Kick in  Which will then create  New jobs  And energy independence  Energy crisis solved  I'll see you at the debates  Bitches  See she's smart  Yeah  Someone wrote that  No kidding  I don't think she came up  With that herself  Now if you'll excuse me  I have to go pick out  A vice president  I'm thinking Rihanna  I'll see you at the White House  Oh 
[01:45:30]  And I might paint it pink  I hope that's cool  With you guys  Bye  I'm Tara Shilton  And I approve this message  And I think it's totally hot  Got it  Overdoing it  Shut up  You don't like that one Jimmy  No  Why  40 minutes  40 minutes  She's just responding  Endlessly  Stop already  Hot  Hot  Bitches  White House debate  We got it  Ha ha ha 
[01:46:00]  Ha ha ha  I'm laughed out  Don't be laughed out  It's only 30% over  Well the point is  She was just goofing  And making fun  Of the fact  That she was using  A political ad  And then Ben Stein  Went on Larry King  And he's just disgusted  By the whole thing  I'm disgusted  Douche  Okay Ben Stein  What is your read  On this important news  Politically of the day  Well I think it's pretty amazing  To see the likes of Paris Hilton  A person who got her start  As a well known national celebrity 
[01:46:30]  By appearing in a porn video  Criticizing McCain  And you left out  The most vicious parts of it  Where she made vicious fun  Of his age  And I  It just shocks me  That a person who is  Who is  Who she is  Has the nerve  To make fun  Of a man named  John McCain  Ben Stein  He's serious?  Is such a  What an idiot  What an out of touch douche  He's a fuddy-duddy  Does this guy know 
[01:47:00]  How to have fun?  No  No his kid did  He's taken  Ha ha ha  That's why he was playing  EverQuest  He wanted to escape that board  Oh  Any fantasy world  Would beat  Having to live with that guy  I'd rather go bark hunting  By myself  I want to build a  A bark machine  For EverQuest  Whatever the queers do  On that dumb game  I'm dragging a slang  Shut up  He has not  You have to make elixirs  Quiet nerd  I have to make a potion  You have to make an elixir  I have to pick weeds  And squeeze them into a potion 
[01:47:30]  So I can  Shut up  Shut up  What  People enjoy their video games  Yeah  Yeah  45 minutes  Gathering tools  And such  In case I happen upon a dragon  Did he say tools and such  I have  I'm  Getting some tools and such  In case I happen upon  A dragon or a wizard  What are you in EverQuest  Ted  Huh  Do you play this EverQuest  Ted  I don't 
[01:48:00]  No  You don't like to gather tools  I don't like it  I was trying to build an amusement park  And a dragon slew me  Amusement park  Ted's world of fun  I was going to call it  And then a dragon slew him  Yes  You played that  You liked that game  Oh I played it for years  Still got the character  What's his name  Still pay  Still pay for the character  What do you mean you pay for the  You have to pay to keep the guy 
[01:48:30]  Well you gotta pay to  Yeah keep your guy  What's his name your character  Oh god I forgot  I haven't played in so long  Keith's been you know  Leveling him up  Can I jump in here  Anthony played the game  For years  And then discovered girls  At his age  Well  So he said  After this EverQuest  It's like weird science  I was kind of married  You know  Yeah  And that kind of started  The whole thing  Oh you were playing  While you were married  Caused some problems  You know  Cause I'd rather come home  And play the video game  Than have sex  Than uh yeah 
[01:49:00]  You don't play anymore  I don't ever see you  I'm barely on the computer  Anymore  Good for you  You're right  Yeah  What would you do  Gather like things  I would gather things  Yes  You'd have to um  Gather certain things  And then uh  Put them in machines  And based on your skill level  It would either uh fail  And you would lose  Like some of your stuff  That you added in  Or it would succeed  And make your little elixir  And then you can go to the  To the uh  Bazaar area  And sell it  Uh 
[01:49:30]  For platinum  And gold  I spent six months  Gathering  Kindling  And fruit roll ups  For what  To build a fruit roll up  Emporium  But does your character  Talk at all  Does it go into fantasy mode  Like does it do everything  You can you can you know  Talk to anybody else  That's around  You team up  Well you're at the market  You go on raids  With uh  A hundred people  Against some kind of  A big dragon  That would you know  Kill everybody 
[01:50:00]  And  So a hundred of you  Other people around the country  Yeah it would take uh  Hours to organize  These raids sometimes  And then you go in there  And do it  Just get what's called  A complete wipe  Where the  The dragon just like  Gets a foothold  And just kills everybody  There's a hundred dead people  And you  You've spent eight hours  Trying to gather  This whole raid together  After you're dead  Is the game over  Uh no the game's not over  Then you gotta find somebody  That can either  Resurrect you  Yeah  Uh or you have to go back  And find your body  And uh 
[01:50:30]  Get all your stuff off of it  It's very uh  Very complicated game  A lot of stuff going on  But like I said  I haven't played in a while  Let's get back to uh  Ben Stein  And Larry King  Ben Stein  This game's not fun  It sucks  It's fun  It sucks  Why don't you just do math  Dude there's a lot of people  That are into that  It sucks  Just do math  Do a  Just get an English book  And read it  Why  It's a little better than math  It sucks  Alright listen  We have one more clip  Wait two hours to have a fight  Ugh  We have one more clip 
[01:51:00]  Of Ben Stein  Going after Paris Hilton  I can't believe he's taking this  So seriously  He's such a dope  He's a very far from perfect guy  And I have criticized  His economic policy  Over and over again  In my column  But to make fun of him  Because of his age  And because of his wrinkles  And infirmities  From being in captivity  For this country  It just staggers me  Did she make fun of his infirmities  From being in captivity  No  I don't think so  No  She said he was a pussy whipped  Guy that gave all the information  Up of the American army 
[01:51:30]  Oh he's funny with the head  Yeah no  I think  Oh yeah she called him  All hanger shoulders  Yeah yeah  That's me  I made fun of his infirmities  Shut up Ben  Called him a coward  How bad does Ben Stein  Want to be on TV  Why wouldn't you just say  You know what  This is a silly dumb thing  I don't need to comment on this  She slapped his face  And went  Meow  Meow  Stupid Paris Hilton  Relax Ben Stein  And she was being  No one takes her seriously  Her picture was being used  Because she's the quintessential dummy  Right  And that's why  So he was actually 
[01:52:00]  Goofing on her first  Right  So she hit back  Right  Ben Stein should have just said  No if you want me on  For something else  Yes I would love to be  On your show  I love her song  But this is ridiculous  What's her song  Oh the stars are blind  I've never heard it  Is it hot  Wonderful  It's hot  You got any  Terrible  Wow  Come on Eric  How do you not have that up  And potted  Potted  We gotta take a break  Because Mike Birbiglia is here  Do you have it though  Alright hit it  E-Rock  Let Jimmy enjoy  For a little bit  He's going in for surgery tomorrow

[01:55:00]  O and A  Look who's in studio  Mike Birbiglia everyone  Yes  How are you Mike?  I'm alright  How you doing?  I'm alright  I'm feeling much better now  I'm just  I  I've never heard so many  I've never read so many  evaluations  Of my life  And my work  Than at the event 
[01:55:30]  That was your show  On Saturday  I guess  Let me do the quick  Set up here  We had our comedy show  At the PNC Bank Art Center  This past Saturday  And the show  Went very very well  Except for Mike Birbiglia  It was really good show  Up until then  We were very excited  Because we kind of  Asked our audience  For a favor  And now they're arguing  This point  Like crazy  All over the place  Sure  How do they expect us  Not to boo  And do stuff  When they do  What they do  On their radio show 
[01:56:00]  On their radio show  They always try to  Turn things around  To make it seem like  We're doing the exact  Same thing  And being hypocrites  That's what  The audience  Will try to do  This is what  They don't understand  We asked for a favor  Because we know  How stupid we are  As a radio show  Hence the favor  Yeah  Hence the favor  You guys  Don't boo anyone  Because we want to  Continue with these  Comedy shows  And book big name  Comedians  The list of people 
[01:56:30]  That said no  To the show  And medium name  Comedians like me  No no no  That's how you end up  Getting medium names  Because the big names  Don't want to get booed  That's not what I'm  No but  Because we also want to  Throw newer guys  To the show  Dennis Leary  Or somebody like that  You always want to  Put a guy like that  On the show  It certainly helps  I mean  Yeah of course  And have them on  But that's the latest argument  Well they do what  They do on the show  And then they expect us  Not to do what we do  That's why we ask for the favor  Because we understand  That whole mentality  Yeah  It's not that we don't  Expect you to boo 
[01:57:00]  If somebody genuinely sucks  Yeah  But I've been doing  Stand up long enough  And I've seen enough  Bad stand up  To know when a crowd  Is booing  When it's not merited  It's almost like  When you see a guy  Up there  Dying  Yeah  And I mean  Just sucking  And they give him a chance  And they give him another chance  And they  But when you give a guy  30 seconds  And the first line  Isn't 100% what you want  And a few people start  Boo  It's like  When it starts that fast  That I think  Is what the issue  Yeah  Let's ask Mike 
[01:57:30]  How fast did it start  Because I wasn't out  On that stage  I was in the back  It was  It was almost  It was when I went  Into my first joke  So it was like  Probably about a minute in  And it was literally like  It was literally like  Being raped  Where  Was the shock  Of like  Wait what  What's going on  Oh okay  And then  You know  I tried all different tactics  I sat down  I walked into the crowd  I like did 
[01:58:00]  I asked people  Why they were booing  I tried to talk through it  And then  It was similar to a rape  In that  As I was driving home  I started to blame myself  And you know  What could I have done differently  Did I lead her on  In some way  I don't know  It was  It was tough  But I don't blame you guys  I've given it a lot of thought  This week  And I don't think of you guys  As Hitler  I think of you as Nietzsche 
[01:58:30]  Where people use your philosophy  For evil  And  But the actual show itself  Is not evil  Well the thing  When you walked out  How did you feel  When you walked out  On the stage  I mean  Was it uncomfortable at all  Because someone said  That you looked  They said when he walked out  He looked a little overwhelmed  By the scene  I don't know  Yeah  You know  I read some of that commentary  I always look like  I mean  You see me now  I always  They'll always say  Hey you look like 
[01:59:00]  You just got out of bed  They say that at 8 at night  They say that at 7 in the morning  I'm like  Yeah yeah  That's what I look like  So sorry about that  That's the way you look  And like  If people  The thing about comedy  And this is why  Shows like that  Can be tough for me  Is like  When I got into comedy  I used to bomb all the time  And bombing in comedy is hard  Because it's not like a play  Or a movie  Where people don't like it  They go  I didn't like the set  Or the costumes  When people don't like it  They're like  We don't like you 
[01:59:30]  You know  Your personality  Yeah  And that's like a hard reality  And so when I was starting out  I was like  Well my style's like  A little different  A little more soft spoken  And so I gotta find my audience  To come to my shows  Because it's a little different  And then I eventually did  And so now when I do shows  People show up  But when I do bigger shows  I'm not gonna get them right away  It's just not how it's gonna be  Probably  Unless they put him on  Where he was on the show  Would have been a difficult spot 
[02:00:00]  For anybody  That's not true  Dude he  I mean  Tom Moreri got booed  He was on early  They booed Jimmy Schubert  He was on early  Yeah but that  Bill Burr got booed there  Yeah but that show itself  Was a unique show  That Philly show  Was a unique show  They were booing  Just to boo  If you didn't get into it  Quick enough  Every other show we've done  Has been pretty much cool  But he actually went on  After the break  After the car thing  After Geraldo  After the car thing again  And then they throw him  And they don't know him  And then the girls  Wouldn't flash their boobs 
[02:00:30]  That was part of it too  People were kind of angry  About that  Like the rock and roll girls  I thought you meant  He was on too late  No he was just  Down at a difficult  Because by the time  They got  I mean look  I mean any spot  On that show  I think is a hard spot  I don't think any spot  On that show  Is an easy spot  I mean look  I had to go after  Di Stefano annihilated  You know what I mean  He just went out  And killed it  For ten minutes  And then I mean  Every spot is a difficult  Even Vos going right out  In front is tough  Everybody is shooting  Their big guns  Nobody's taking it lightly 
[02:01:00]  So but he should have  Went on maybe earlier  In the show  Where it was kind of  Sped up a little bit  The first half of the show  Goes quick  It's like comic  Comic  Comic  Comic  Break  The second half  It's night  They've been there  For hours  And then you add in  That car thing  And then you add in  Another car thing again  You really break  The whole show process  When you go off  What you gotta do  You gotta give the car away  You gotta do other things  I gotta jump in  As far as the car thing goes  I was completely disappointed  How that went down  They gave us a car to give away  From allamerican4.net 
[02:01:30]  Not disappointed about that  Just disappointed how we had  To give it away  Because when this was presented  To us  We were like  Yeah man  We'll bring a car on stage  And have guys  Try to start it up  With these keys  And one key  Only one key  Is gonna start up  That's kind of cool  And that's exciting  And then I got word  Well we can't get the car  On the stage  But we can put it on the side  So at least we're still  In the venue  And then I get there  On Saturday  They're like  We gotta do it backstage  And I go to Pete  I swear  And I hate to trash Pete  Because he's a soldier 
[02:02:00]  And he does the right thing  By us  I go Pete  This isn't gonna work this way  He goes no no no  It's okay  It's okay  And I'm like  I'm telling you  It's not  We're completely disconnected  From the audience  This is like  We had 10,000 people  Watching TV  It just doesn't work  You're right about that  But how many keys  Did you have to have  55 people  With one key  Just have 10  We had 20  20  That's a lot  And the 15th guy  Started the car  That's a lot of keys  I understand  Have five keys 
[02:02:30]  What was the reason  They couldn't have  The car on stage  That's obviously  A venue decision  But why  It was a  Yeah they wanted  More money  To reinforce the stage  Which is ridiculous  Because have we  All been to shows  Would you see the crap  They put on these stages  It's pretty amazing  It's pretty amazing  What they could do  With these stages  Can somebody just  Look at the pal talk  And see all the stuff  They're writing about  Reinforcing the stage  For me right now  Yeah  Yeah sure  I know that's just happening  Stupid Steve from Bayshore 
[02:03:00]  It actually is  Steve from Bayshore  Reinforce the stage  But Bobby's lost  So much weight  Yeah  Well that was actually  It's big Steve  So then we decide  We gotta do it this way  And then the camera  Keeps crapping out  Because someone  Tripped over the core  And then they  Duck tape it together  I'm like this is  Just wonderful  You had 30  Miserable chicks  Just standing around  The car  The K-Rock girls  Wouldn't have flash  No  That was a big thing  Is that actually  Started some of the  Booing too 
[02:03:30]  They were booing  For the girls  And then  They were a little  Up high  They got into the  Boo mood  They were still booing  And then when you  Go on stage  Mike is a trooper  Though  He leaves the stage  He's like  Yeah that was alright  He's just trying to  Smile  That's cool guys  That's cool  Me and him  Talked for like  20 minutes  And I could tell  It wasn't cool  But you put on  The good face  There Mike  Some people  Were nice to me  You know  Opie was nice  And your fiance  Was so nice  And were all  Talking to me  And then some people  Treated me like  Kryptonite backstage 
[02:04:00]  Like I'm not  Going near that guy  If any of that  Rubs off on me  I'm going to be  In a bad place  Well people don't  Know what to say  Sometimes they don't  Want to make you  Uncomfortable  Like the word  I  What everyone was  Saying was  Well he handled  It like a comic  I mean like  In the sense  That it wasn't  Some panic stricken  Oh my god  It was like  Kind of like  A belligerent comic  Like alright  This is happening  So I'll just  I'll just kind of  I'll do what I  Gotta do  The thing that you  Said that was  Kind of funny  That was comic like  He actually said  No that was 
[02:04:30]  In response to them  Was he said  I can live in this  Uncomfortable  And this can you  Yeah  That was  That was  Very common  Well cause I think  Everyone understood  Backstage that Mike  Is a really funny guy  It wasn't like  Oh wow  Well I called  I called Bill Burr  On the way home  And uh  Did you really  I swear to god  Yeah  And uh  Do Bill Burr  Well yeah  And he goes  Dude  He goes  It's not  You know  I'm gonna  Mess up my  I don't really do  A Bill Burr  But I try  Is uh  He was like  That's not in the  Comedy handbook 
[02:05:00]  He was like  Uh  He was like  There's no  There's no chapter  In the uh  Comedy handbook  On row triple F  They don't talk  About lawn seats  In the handbook  It's not you  You know  And I was like  Is this gonna happen  To me all the time  He's like  No that's what  I was saying to myself  For a week  After it happened  I thought that  Was gonna happen  For the rest of my career  But it's like  No  No  It's one thing  Forget about it  Just go home  You're fine 
[02:05:30]  That was Bill  So that was actually  Really reassuring  Bill really was  An hour  Helped me out  Cause I was like  I was driving home  And Opie was really nice  He was like  Sleep well  You know  Cause he knows  About my sleeping problems  He goes  Sleep well man  Get some rest  And uh  I did say  Make sure that  The sleeping bag  Is extra tight  Make sure the sleeping bag  Is on  Cause  Cause if I had gotten  In a car accident  On the way home  Cause the traffic  Was weird  On the way home 
[02:06:00]  A lot of drunk drivers  And if I had died  That blood would have been  On 8,000 people's hands  Oh yeah yeah  They wouldn't have cared  Like yeah you know  Maybe we shouldn't have  Booed him for no reason  Now he's dead  And they wouldn't even  Have thought it  No they wouldn't  Like twice  Given a second thought  No no way  They were booing to the point  Where you couldn't do  Your act anymore  So you go into the audience  And you're like  Why are you booing  Because I only gave you  Less than a minute  Of material  Yeah  30 seconds  Yeah  That one guy did say  Something funny  He goes  It's 120  Why are you wearing 
[02:06:30]  A hoodie  That was kind of funny  But you know  But why would you  Boo a guy  Because he's wearing  A hoodie  Just trying to be  Old fashionable  I don't really think  I don't really think  Through my outfits  If you just look at  That guy's face though  He was  You know he was  Just drunk and hot  He was like  It's 120  Why are you wearing  A hoodie  I'm hot  That's true  I don't know  What to say Mike  I'm sorry  Nothing you can do man  I mean your fiance  Was really nice  Because she was like  She was talking to me  About it  And she goes  And this is how 
[02:07:00]  Delusional I am  As a human being  She goes  She goes  She's like  All these girls around  You're probably  Going to get laid  Tonight  And I was like  Yeah  That's  That's one of the  Weird things  About this business  She goes  No I'm kidding  You would never  Get laid tonight  That's why  I love her  That's why I love her  I mean it was  Just so devastating  She is great  At that role  When she wants to  She rules 
[02:07:30]  A good smashing  After your bombing  Did you look  Into her eyes  Her magical eyes  Leave my girl's eyes  Alone please  Her dragon wizard eyes  Did it make it okay  Dragon wizard  I think Bobby  Was suggesting  That she goes on stage  To kind of  Mesmerize the crowd  With her eyes  You should show her eyes  Just a close up  Of one of her eyes  And the crowd  Would be hypnotized  The worst part  About the whole thing  Is all week  People coming up to me  Just being like  Yeah you know  What you should have 
[02:08:00]  Said at that show  Was this  You know  All the advice  In the world  Yeah  You know what though  I think you tried  Everything  I really do  I tried a lot  I really do  You tried to  Turn it around  You tried to  Make it into  It's own thing  In retrospect  I should have  Just plugged  All of my merchandise  Like shirts  Are available  At the ticket window  Yeah  My CD is available  On iTunes  Oh see  Yeah  And they would have been  Boo  You just plug away  Yeah  Now you know  What you should have done  This works for me  People are yelling  And I'm like  Hey can you keep it down  A dull roar  A dull roar  A dull roar 
[02:08:30]  There's a lot of people  Though  I mean  I listen to the audio  There's a lot of people  Applauding  And a lot of people  I mean when you were like  You know  Give it up for me  Or whatever  There was a lot of people  I mean there was a small  Percentage of them  That were booing  For some reason  The booing  Is just so loud  Yeah  It was like  It was like a wall  Of sound  I couldn't break through  We're not supposed  To hear it on stage  Like you're used to  Laughs or whatever  Or occasional chatter  In a comedy club  But not a chorus  Of people making  A guttural noise 
[02:09:00]  Which  Booing is  It's so universally awful  Like booing is never  Good anywhere  No  Aborigines  If someone does something  And one goes  Boo  They know they did  A bad job  It's huge  You know  Sometimes you'll get  People heckling you  At a show  Or something  And I've even said  This before  It's like  No matter how mean  What you guys say to me  It's no worse  Than what I'm saying  To myself  In my head  All day  Every day  When that booing  Happened 
[02:09:30]  I was like  Oh that's actually  Louder  Yeah  Than the voice  In my head  Oh really  That's actually louder  That's not good  Did you answer the question  When was the last time  You got booed  Do you even remember  I don't even recall  I've been heckled  Over the years  Usually it's at  Corporate events  Things where it's  Like a real bad  Scenario  Douches  Oh they're the worst  The guy who's funny  Around the  It's what Bill  What about Bill  Yeah  Exactly  But there's always  One older lady  That's at the court  That everybody hates 
[02:10:00]  And you're doing your stuff  And all the young guys  Are laughing  And then that one lady  Is like  You're not funny  Get off the stage  And now you're stuck  Do I get off  No keep going  You're awesome  Did someone yell that at you  Oh I had that  At a Christmas party  And then on the way out  It was just an awful mess  And then on the way out  I lost the check  I had to go back in  Help me  Do you guys see a check  They're all just looking  No we haven't seen the check  I don't know how you guys  Deal with that on the road  Wait  When was the Christmas party  When was this  I have to know  What this was  This was  Is that going to be 
[02:10:30]  A great holiday gift for me  Right  To watch that  One time I  I showed up at a college  And they had me performing  In the center of a walk-a-thon  For cancer  And it was like  In a gymnasium  And the guy looks at me  Who booked me  And the straight face goes  I know it's not ideal  And I literally  Had to kind of like  Well they booked  Entertainment in the middle  I kind of had to like  Oscillate like a fan  Like in a circle  Doing comedy  Like blowing jokes  At people as they walked  In a circle 
[02:11:00]  Like literally  It was like an all night  Trying to help cancer  Yeah yeah  And you're looking for laughs  That's  I got booed at the  The old Boston Garden  14,000 people  Mark Parenteau  And Chachi  Remember Chachi  He's still around  He's still there  He's still doing BCN  They called us up  Me and Dane  And this kid Al  And this other guy  Jay we're in an improv group  Here it is by the way  The Dane Cook  The Dane Cook mention  By Bob Kelly  Has to do it every time  He's on  No that's not true  I've never done it  You've done it  Never

[02:12:00]  Where'd you get that  That's why you  You spent 147 minutes  Looking at this  For a random number  Well they put us on that  Rock  Remember the Rock of Boston show  They'd have in the garden  They put us on  In between the spin doctors  And fish  At the end of the show  To do improv  In front of 14,000 people  I remember looking at Dane's face  In the middle of a freeze improv  And just one bead of sweat  Coming down his face  And they just started going 
[02:12:30]  Na na na na  Hey  Oh god no  And then I  Because I wasn't letting it happen  I took my shirt off  Because back then I was shredded  And I gave my  Martin Luther King speech  I know you guys  Didn't come here to see  Comedy  You came here to see  Rock and roll  Wow  The spin doctors  Wow  Fish  Wow  And then I went  But before we leave  Give us three things  That piss you off  Besides us  Like I was still trying  To get improv things 
[02:13:00]  To finish our improv  Then they started  Throwing shoes and lighters  Can we have a household object  Yeah exactly  Throw a couch at them  And then they  Everybody just  We were the kings  Before that  Everybody just left  Nobody would talk to us  Parento  Nobody  Nobody would even look at us  And then  Dane and Al  Left me there  I was out front  They were supposed to  Pick me up out front  They just went home  They were so  Phased by this whole thing  They went home  I'm out front  As the concert lets out  By a pay phone  Waiting for them 
[02:13:30]  To pick me up  And everybody's just  Pointing at me  Going that's him  That's him  That's the guy  And then Dane goes  And sells out the thing  Twice and shoots  An HBO special there  Yeah  Yeah  You gotta kind of  It certainly was a motivator  He kind of turned it around  Huh Jimmy  Yeah  Yeah  I was dramatically  Fading up our music  That's not playing  Oh  The music playing  I wanted to play  I didn't know  If it was time  To go away yet  Yeah it's time to go  Well Mike thank you  Yeah no problem  Thank you  And I apologize  To anyone who  Came to see me

[02:16:30]  That's gotta be good  No I don't  I basically don't see shit anymore  I don't see friends  I see nothing  Inside the airplanes  What I've done  Is successfully locked myself  Out of my own life  I don't even see it  That's how stupid it is  The life of a comedian  You guys  I mean it's  You get famous  And then you have to  Just say goodbye to your life  And just spend your  Yeah  Your famous years on the road  Being miserable  I wouldn't know what that was like  What?  God forbid the mic's on  Go ahead  Yeah whatever  There you go  You ever hear of comic timing? 
[02:17:00]  You know what I know about that?  I know I had one  It was a good one  It was a self-deprecating doozy  But my mic wasn't on  What did you say?  I'm not gonna say  I was ordering tuna fish  Yeah  We don't really have a boss right now  So we're just fucking around  You know boss?

[02:17:30]  What is your contract?  We got 53 days left there  Thanks for asking  Well I was just wondering  53 days left  And our agent  Excuse me  He used the term  I'm sending off an exploratory  What did he say?  Memo  Oh I don't know  An exploratory memo  To Sirius XM satellite radio  Not to get into the whole thing  But that was a little  Was that after the talk?  Unsettling to hear  That was after the talk or before? 
[02:18:00]  I don't know  What the fuck's an exploratory memo?  I'm having a negotiation at a big table  There you are  With fucking five other white guys  I can tell you this much  Anthony and I and our agent  Had a nice conference call yesterday  And we got a lot of things done  But then Bob decided  To end the conversation  By saying  Well I'm going to send off  An exploratory memo  I'm like  I think after what we  All just talked about  It should be better  Than an exploratory memo  Yeah  Whatever  It's just fun to bring up 
[02:18:30]  On the show  I don't want  I don't want to fucking  Not make as much  As I'm making now  What?  I don't know  What happened Jimmy?

[02:19:00]  Fucking the truth  Catching hell  It's just like  Coming to  You know  It's like  Visiting a stroke  That's what happened  The other day  I was on here  With Bobby Lee  And I make jokes about mad TV  And I get hate mail  Yeah  You can't make fun of mad TV  It's not understood  That we can shit on that show  At this point  I didn't even know it was still on  I know  Lewis brings up a great point though  We don't want you guys  Ever figuring it out  This atmosphere  Oh no  You start feeling good about yourself 
[02:19:30]  Like I'm alright  I'm going to take my shots  And then we blasted it  For taking shots  When does that happen?  When do you start feeling good about yourself?  On this show  Never  We don't want you to ever feel good  That's the point I'm making  We don't even feel good about ourselves  Right  I don't  We want you to continue guessing  I don't like this microphone  I feel like I'm an evangelist  Sitting here  I'm going to give you a prayer cloth  If you just send a donation right now  Bobby's in the lounge chair  I really am  Like he's getting ready to watch some football  I don't want you to sit like this  Yeah  Why would you sit like that?

[02:21:00]  I have not seen it  But I've heard about it  Well that's all I need  You know  That's all I need  That's all I need Jim  I need people to hear about it  You've seen it  That's what my fucking life has been  Getting on the radio  And letting people hear about it  That's what Chappelle's show is like  People heard about it  Yeah  People just talk about it  I mean uh  I woke up yesterday  Worrying about my whole life  At six in the morning  And then I walked around by myself  Came back in  Went to sleep  Woke up  Checked my MySpace  Went back to sleep  Checked my MySpace again 
[02:21:30]  Went back to sleep  Did a spot last night  And then went to sleep  I hate myself  I have no life  And now our audience  Is also  Asleep  Therein lies  We just had to live that with you  Therein lies the ha ha  But Lewis  Aren't you happy  That you get to go on the road  And these big crowds  Come out  No I like doing  The happiest is  When I'm doing stand up  Yeah  Because the  Total freedom  Yeah  I mean that's where  It's the best 
[02:22:00]  It's me in the audience  And I don't have somebody  Going you know  If you just said  Instead of  It would have been  Much funnier  And for the most part  The political correctness  Movement hasn't really  Hit the comic clubs  There's a little tiny bit  Here and there  But  Well it's great  When they're in the audience  It's like  It's like  It's like going to heaven  For me  You just do theaters now too  You're not doing clubs anymore  I still go back and do clubs  Oh you do clubs  Yeah you kind of  Got to go back and do clubs  Because it's really  Where you fucking  Kind of get conversational  And work some shit out  But I do 
[02:22:30]  I'm comfortable enough  In the theater  That I  I don't do anything  Except write on  I don't write anything down  So I gotta be on  You know  So I've learned  How to write on  In theaters  On stage  Do people give you  Awful suggestions  For your show  Like you could have  This versus that  Dude I got it  Yeah you know  Tit fucking versus  Mouth shitting  Yeah exactly  Why is that awful  You know  Prell versus pledge  Lewis was saying  He wanted to come in here today  Because he did  One of those radio tours  And he felt like  He needed to do  An actual radio show 
[02:23:00]  And I thought  That was a nice compliment  There Lewis  What are you trying  To say with that  I'm just trying to be  Nice for a change  Right  You know  They set you  Try to prop up  Your 53 days  That are left  And hope  You can take that  Quote to the table  So what  You go to your  Just hang out  In your apartment  And you have a list of  You see your apartment  And you know  And you have a list  Of places from  I did a  What essentially  Sounded like  A woman in her own  House  Somewhere on the prairie 
[02:23:30]  Outside of Peoria  In a town  I'd never heard of  Who has Aunt Lori's  Funny hour at noon  Aunt Lori's  Funny hour  But she knew everybody  But it was like  Nuts  I mean it's like  Well if you're going to be  The host of the funny hour  You better know  You better know  The funny people  Exactly  But it's like  It's like talking  To Aunt B  You know  It wasn't like  Talking to somebody  You know  They're funny  I like them too  But it was  That's why I was 
[02:24:00]  Kind of bitching  A bit  Because I've been doing  They put me on  And it's supposed to  Now I've got a CD  So I have a CD  The TV show  And I've got  Whatever the fuck else  The book  You know  I've got the book  So they go  So you go on  And all you want to do  Is talk about the CD  You know  Really that's it  Because it's like  I don't  There's  There is a level  Of uncomfortable  You know that  About when you're  Promoting your own show  Or you're doing  Any of that shit  Oh yeah  Look at my titties  I got a big quad 
[02:24:30]  Fuck me  It's like ridiculous  Especially after like  Ten of them in a row  So nobody seemed  To know anything  So they're going  They start with  You know  So you got a book  You got this  You got that  Boy  You got a lot of stuff  So by the end  Of the interview  Basically everything  Has been  It's like  Buy Lewis's  You know  Triple crown pizza  Might as well  Put a fucking salad  But the  There was  Half the shows  Were miserable  Just 
[02:25:00]  And not like  In what way  Not in the old school  Way of like  Wow  We're so happy  You know  None of that  They seem to have  Realized I'm not  Going to do that  Anymore  But there was  A show in Orlando  And it's supposed  To be the largest  Radio outlet  There  Apparently  You know  For the morning show  And the guy goes  So  You wrote a book  Then there's like  You know  Working  Silence isn't fun  On the radio 
[02:25:30]  So you're  Waiting for him  To kind of  Does the pause  And then there's  So I'm waiting  And he goes  Me  Little faith  That seems to be  About religion  Right  It went like that  It was like  And now there's  Two other people  In the studio  And I'm waiting  For somebody  Like did he have  A stroke  So yeah  I wrote a book  About religion  And then  It takes me  Like three minutes  To realize  I'm going to  Have to do  Ten times more work 
[02:26:00]  Yeah  But it was just  He didn't care  About like silence  So when I get  Back on with the  Guy who's doing  The tour  They got the  Somebody who  You know  I said  What was that about  Because that's  The way they are  That's the way  They are  He said yeah  They're the top  Rated show in Orlando  You know how you  Have to handle that  When the guy goes  You did a book  You gotta come back  With a little energy  I did  I did  I did  I did  But the best 
[02:26:30]  I was telling you  Was about the  The one  You know bright light  Was the guys  In wherever they were  I don't even remember  Who  There was a condition  Where when you  Of a narcoleptic condition  You guys said  You discussed it  Of when you laugh  You pass out  And they had  This girl in the store  God we were trying  To get her  All day yesterday  Motherfuckers  They had her  Or another girl  They had her  No I don't know  If they had her  Or maybe they just  Found someone else  This is a 21 year old girl  Where is she from  I don't remember  Is she British 
[02:27:00]  No she wasn't British  Okay it's not the bitch  See but that's what  We should have done  What station was it  He doesn't remember  We should have done  The same thing  I don't even know  What day it is  We should have got  Someone with the same condition  That was the way  To go with that bit  Because we were trying  To get the actual one  They had in the news  We were going to make her laugh  Over a pile of AIDS needles  We had to walk her  Fall into them  And she explained  To her future husband  Take my cock out  She just passes out  Jimmy's on to something  Though we would cure her  Trust me  You get the AIDS needles  And go look  Are you going to pass out 
[02:27:30]  Alright we're going to see  We're going to see  How real this disease really is  That's great  You pull out a joke book  It's considered a roofie  Two Jews walk into a bar  They own it  Hop in there  So  Were you knocking this girl out  With your jokes  Well I mean we started  You started  You know  It's like  You know  Once you get somebody  And they just describe  A medical condition  To you  It's 7.45 in the morning  You don't really feel  Like bouncing on it  Because she's like  This very  You know well  I just 
[02:28:00]  I try to  You know  Avoid  I try  I smile  Avoid laughing  Avoid laughing  I thought  What the  And so I ended up  Talking about it  In terms of like  What the  Who the fuck  Would go out with you  You know  Really  Who do you  You know  Somebody  She's going to pass out  Ben Stein  You're the perfect couple  You nailed it  I was going to go  With Club Soda Kenny  Perfect  For Club Soda Kenny  Oh my god  It was all about  Tragic stories  Zoom and gloom 
[02:28:30]  So she would  Never pass out  I got a great line  You could have used too man  She said  I don't laugh much  You should have hit her with  Sounds like my mother-in-law  Nah the old mother-in-law joke  God man  People go crazy for those  So did she pass out?  No  She did eventually  Because they  They grabbed  Some section of a CD of mine  And played it  And she went  And they literally went  Holy god  Because apparently  She just fell off the chair  Can we get one of these  Dopes in studio  I don't see why 
[02:29:00]  You're tracking one  Because it's a condition  That's what I'm saying  We'll just  We'll take to anyone  Yeah we don't need  The actual woman  That was in the news  But the problem  With you guys is  Is that you'll end up  With some girl  Who doesn't have the condition  Just to be on the fucking show  I know  Exactly  Then you'll waste  All those AIDS needles  Sorry to interrupt  We have to get  Danny Aiello's CD  Oh  Wow that looks good  He's going to be performing  In Atlantic City  With that new CD  I like Danny  But I want to hear that CD  Oh you should hear it 
[02:29:30]  Immediately  It can't be good  What are you drinking  Hydrogen peroxide  What is that bottle  Jimmy turned me on to that  Hydrogen peroxide  What happens  If a dominatrix  Shits in your mouth  Hang on  Wait a minute  Well stop  What  Just if you have a cut  In your mouth  You can  I'll rinse with that  I got a little too aggressive  Oh a cut  Yeah  Okay  If you need to know  I got a little too aggressive  With some dental floss  Jesus Christ 
[02:30:00]  Concertina wire  I'm dying  My upper gum  On the inside  Is like just cut  So Jimmy washes his mouth  Now with this stuff  And then it gets all foamy  And it takes care of the situation  It will hurt your feelings a little  But they say you should mix it with water  But you know me Lou  I say the heck with me  No I do it straight  Yeah me too  Oh you do this too  I used to do it  Yeah see  When I got aggressive  With my capsidine wire  But you can't use too much  But it's bad for the enamel  On your teeth  Really?

No what I'd like to do  Is figure out  How to like  Space things out  Look  When they fucking  Finally offer you  Something  At the tail end  Of your life  And you didn't have  You know  You basically did  You know  You schlubbed around  You fucking do  Really  You're gonna let me do this  You're gonna let me write a book  Can I tell you how annoying  Somebody gives a shit  How annoying it was  We have Black Sabbath in here  And it turns out  Dio's a big fan of yours 
[02:32:30]  You know how much  It was like a knife in my stomach  Oh it's black  Oh I forgot  Yeah  They all love you  He was ranting about you  All the fucking rock guys  Love you  Yeah  It drives me nuts  Yeah I know  Lewis  I know  I know  He's my friend  Shut up  No but he loves you  He's like  You know  They're all Daily Show fans  That's funny  Where are we at  With the presidential race  What's your thoughts  We're fucked  We are so fucking fucked  You hate both of them  I'm really at the point  Where I think it's 
[02:33:00]  Well first off  I feel like they've been running  This election's been going on  Since I was nine years old  I have a dim memory  Of Dwight Eisenhower  When I was a child  And this has replaced  Everything else  I've ever known  He's so right  This thing seems like  It's been going on forever  Think about it  It's fucking  It's nonstop  And it's not even  They're not even talking  About anything anymore  He's in Sturgis yesterday  You gotta be  Fucking kidding me  That's where  All the bikers go  Well Jesus Christ  Has anybody got a brain  In their fucking head 
[02:33:30]  Like he's a biker  Jesus fucking Christ  He is  His arms are like  Handlebars  Didn't he try to get  His wife in the  Wet t-shirt contest  What was that about  She was going to run  She was going to be  In the beauty contest  The beauty contest  Or something  Which the winner  Has to show her tits  Right  Yeah that was  Well the Daily Show  Actually ran some nice stuff  Yeah  Going from what he was saying  And then showing  What was the actuality 
[02:34:00]  Of Sturgis  The Daily Show  Is still strong my friend  It's doing well  They've been just  They've picked up  And they've gotten  They're doing fun  But it's also because of them  These guys  It's spectacular  What's unbelievable  This is one of the  I've never seen two guys  Fight to be in the center  Faster  Yeah  You know  And they're  They are both saying  Like they're running  Clean campaigns  None of it  And every single one of them  Has bashed the other guy  Worse than I've seen it 
[02:34:30]  And they just  Yeah like you said  It's gone on forever  And these two are such  Opposites  That it's one of the most  Lopsided  Yeah  Elections I've ever seen  Yeah  They're totally opposite  And you don't know  Who would you vote  Who the hell would you vote for  The old guy that can't move  Yeah  The old stiff guy that can't move  That they seem to be  Cutting pieces off of  On a daily basis  This guy's on a fucking  Carving board  At a buffet  They're just taking pieces of him 
[02:35:00]  Or  The first black president  This is what I would do  And this is becoming  And this actually  May get me through  Tonight's show  Because I need shit to do  You know that  There's an old movie  Called The Defiant Ones  Where Sidney Poirier  And Tony Curtis  Are chained together  You know  These two prisoners  That's what they ought to do  Just chain them together  Chain the two pricks together  And they're stuck together  The whole fucking time  And you fucking figure it out 
[02:35:30]  Because they're both so big  On like  We're going to do  The compromise thing  Well you chain them together  They'll come up  That's a good idea  Yeah I mean isn't that  What they did in the early days  Of our country  Where kind of the runner up  Got to be the vice president  That was the way it went first  Yeah  Yeah true  Yeah  Yeah  That was how  The first few elections  I think  Yeah  But no they don't do that anymore  They also had to wear wigs  Yeah  There were a lot of differences  Yeah  A lot of differences back then  But I really think we're screwed 
[02:36:00]  I mean I think we're utterly screwed  Oh yeah  Now there's  I don't know  I don't know what the next four years will bring  The only thing people have hoped for is  It's not Bush  Yeah  They're like okay  At least it's not Bush  Yeah  No matter who gets elected  We have a big problem  Because whoever's president next  Has to get us out of a recession  And out of a war  And the last time I checked  Best way to get out of a recession  Start a war  It's like we played that hand a little early  But they won't even say we're in a recession  Yeah I know 
[02:36:30]  Or a war  We're in a freedom finding mission  Yeah it's some kind of a thing  But it's not really a war  And the recession  No it's not a recession  Right  And an economic downturn  Sure  Which will come up when the price of oil drops  Which it has been  And this was my theory  And they've actually listened to me  Lewis  I can't wait for this  My theory  Yeah  Not my theory  My policy  Yes  Drill 
[02:37:00]  Drill  Drill  I knew that  Drill the hell out of every piece of real estate  That has a drop of Wesson under it  I don't care what it is  That's your  That's true  Drill  Make this country look like a piece of  Alaska  I want those  I want those  Ka-chunk  Ka-chunk  Ka-chunk  Those little things everywhere  Make it look like a piece of Swiss cheese  Right  Drill  And  Use our smarts  We go off the coast of Venezuela  They got plenty of oil  You go out into international waters  And on an angle 
[02:37:30]  You drill right into their shit  And you suck it out  And ship it back up here  Who are they to say?  Okay  The problem with that theory  Yeah  For me  Yeah  Is by the time we get the oil  I'm fucking dead  Yeah  Yeah  Okay  There's the problem with that goddamn theory  Which is why old Mr. Schmuck  Fuck nut  McCain goes  Oh it's the drill  Oh what do you give a shit  You're gone  Yeah yeah  He's done  They're still out there digging  Lewis  And that whole concept of you dig for oil  And somehow the price of fucking oil goes down 
[02:38:00]  What bullshit  No  That day it'll drop  That's nonsense  Oh yeah  They'll be going  Oh look they're digging  They said  They've said that if the  The oil in Alaska  Would literally last  Literally about six months  In the world market  Oh  Who says that  The liberal panty wastes  Nobody knows shit  I know  Nobody even knows what's under there  You know where there's a ton of oil  Fuck nut  Where  Under Los Angeles  Drill  That's where I'd go  Yeah  Drill LA  Yeah  No that's where I would go 
[02:38:30]  That's apparently where there's a ton  Well why won't they drill  The oil companies have land  Like millions of acres  They haven't drilled on yet  Why won't they drill  Where they're allowed to  I don't know  Why is it that they've got  A billion gazillion dollars  And then they say  Well we have to leave them that money  Because for their exploration  And as far as I can see  They haven't found shit  Not exploring  You know  I mean  It's like  There are places  How great would it be  If the best alternate fuel  Wasn't solar  It was baby feet  Like one baby foot 
[02:39:00]  Gave you 600 miles a gallon  What to do  What to do  Start hacking off baby feet  Exxon baby feet  Just pump it right into your vehicle  Little baby feet  You hear like  Ow  Let's go  Hey Louis  Hold up  Louis you have more knowledge  Than all of us  As far as politics go  Who should be president  Not  And I'm not  I don't mean 
[02:39:30]  Choose between McCain and Obama  Obviously  I mean who should  Be president  That decided  Hey not to run  Bloomberg  Bloomberg  You know  Just out of the sheer  The fact  You need a businessman in there  Well you know what I like  About him  Because when he became  First when he became  Governor  It's like  You know what I like  He's not around  That's true  He doesn't like  Come out  He pops up every so often  And when he talks  It's like so quiet  You don't really have to hear it  You know what I mean  He doesn't impose  He doesn't really necessarily 
[02:40:00]  Seem to impose his will  Shit seems to roll along  If there's a problem  He shows up  But a Jew for president  We'll never see that  Not in my life  Route 80 would have  Fucking bike lanes on it  Cock sucker  I can't drive down  And look at trannies anymore  Because fucking  Half the thing is bike lanes  He loves his  God damn bike lanes  I know  He's fucking simp  He is  But he is a good mayor  But he's a good  But you know  I mean I'm just at this point  The whole concept  Has always been  You know 
[02:40:30]  That well  You know  That whole idea  Of government  Is a piece of shit  Because it's not run  Like a business  Well let's experiment  Fuckers  Yeah  Let him  You know  He made a gazillion  Catrillion  Pashillion  Fuck dollars  On a god damn station  I can't watch  For more than  Eight seconds  If that happened  What are you  Who the fuck  Watches that  Dollsville  As I like to call it  Dollsville  If Bloomberg won  All the conspiracy theorists  Wouldn't have anything to say  They'd be like  Jews run the government  Yeah  They do  Well  Yeah 
[02:41:00]  Officially  They got elected  Well  Bloomberg has that little  Liff too  He sounds a little  Fucking silly  People have speculated  That he might be a little fruity  Yeah everything he does  This parade is  Fantastic  Well look at  Fucking Ed Koch  Yeah  He wasn't exactly  The man of men  He has a roommate  Are you the truth  Yeah  He's got a live in roommate  Wink wink  Uncle Ed's friend  Yeah  Uncle Ed's friend  The hairdresser  The young twink hairdresser  He's been piling around  With Uncle Eddie  Yeah he was a little 
[02:41:30]  You know the other thing  I like about Bloomberg  Which was  Which was the most  Extraordinary thing  I've ever seen anybody  Do in a long time  Was is that  You woke up one morning  And you got your post  Of your times  In it was an insert  In which he said  We've been sitting around  Trying to plan transportation  For the next 30 years  Around this area  And nobody's  Fucking done that  And then of course  They said  You know  Half of his stuff  They said  They shoot it down  Yeah well of course  They don't like it  We're not going to do that  We're going to jam  All the cars we can  Into the Lincoln Tunnel  Until it explodes 
[02:42:00]  That's their concept  But at least he gave it a shot  You know  Like he has  He has actually  Kind of  Has people sit around  And think about shit  I like that pricing plan thing  Because  Because you're rich  No because  I come in so early  I wouldn't have to pay  Is that right?  Sure  Well what's the pricing plan  For the rest of the country  Basically paying tolls  What you would do is  In order to enter Manhattan  Into the midtown area  You could go way uptown  Or you know  Way downtown 
[02:42:30]  But into midtown area  Where there's the most traffic  You'd have to pay  Like ten bucks  Or something like that  To get in  How would they do that?  I don't know how they collect it  I think somebody just hops up  On the fucking running boards  Of your vehicle with a gun  Yeah exactly  Like old school  Truck hijackers  And takes it  They just have up those  Sawhorses  Yeah  Then they pull them aside  Because obviously  They couldn't do the  Tollbooth thing  That would work so well  On the east side 
[02:43:00]  Fucking traffic from Long Island  Breezes in anyway  I could see setting up  Some fucking tolls over there  Yeah  Hey did John Stewart  Really mention  Say I gotta thank Bill  From Portugal  That Bush took 758 days off  In his seven and a half years  In office  How do we know that?  Because they track  I think they keep tabs  On the president  And where he is  Is he working today?  What the fuck is he?  Where is he?  Well he would go to Crawford  You know  For three, four, five weeks  Every summer  And that's the most ever  Obviously  And the other thing 
[02:43:30]  And I really  I'll get to Obama  In a second  But about McCain  Which I heard yesterday  Which shocked  Actually shocked me  Because I've met him  I like McCain  And he  He's voted the least amount  In the Senate  In the last  Like eight  He's like the least  He's not shown up  For votes  It's just amazing  And then it's like  Well I'll go run  Why are you allowed  To not show up  For votes  If you're a senator  I don't get that  It just doesn't make sense  Shouldn't that be part  Sort of like 
[02:44:00]  Look at the very least  Can you show up  For the votes  I mean really  Even if you call in the vote  Or text it in  I don't know what  Like we said  This has been going on forever  The Obama Hillary thing  That just went on  And on and on  What were they doing  Didn't they have jobs  Didn't they have jobs  As senators  I always wonder about that  For states  And did nothing  There's no way  She could actually  Hold down that job  And perform the duties  To the best of her ability  When she's stumping  In fucking  East bum fuck 
[02:44:30]  You should be forced  To resign your current job  Exactly  To go for the new job  Yeah  That's exactly it  Because  There shouldn't be  It was a waste of time  At least we had  Old Chuck Schumer  Holding down the fort  Another Jew  How was he  How did he  Live  Without  Because it is  Life support for him  He needs to breathe  Oxygen  Directly from  Hillary's asshole  He can't  So when she left  It was very difficult 
[02:45:00]  For him  He had an inhaler  With just Hillary's  Asshole smell  That he had to just  Breathe in like  Primatine mist  Which also smells like  The breath of another woman  That's fucking Schumer  Back in the day  I went to the Oyster Fest  Out there on Long Island  And this Chuck Schumer  Was walking around  It was packed with people  With a huge sign  That went about  Six feet over his head  That read  Meet Chuck Schumer  As he was walking 
[02:45:30]  M-E-A-T  As he was walking  Meet Chuck Schumer  And then people  Running up to  You know  The peeps that were there  Saying hey  You want to meet Chuck  Want to meet Chuck  He's right over there  And no one cared  Just walking through the crowd  With this huge sign  Over his head  Meet Chuck Schumer  How great would it be  If there was a sign  That said smell  Chuck Schumer's balls  Big line  Yeah  And you were allowed  To rub a middle finger  Under where his bag 
[02:46:00]  And his leg meet  And guess  Oh  Oh  That's really  Was this on  Was this on your radio tour  Yesterday  Was that mentioned  You get to rub  Between his balls and leg  And then you have to guess  What hamburger topping  It smells the most  Oh fuck  Wow  That's really gonna  That's gonna stay with me  All day  Where's that sign  And then we got 
[02:46:30]  Yeah  Obama  Who's  Obama's wife  Is a little more unnerving  Than Obama is  Yeah  She  She's a loose cannon  I've seen him  Shut her right up  Yeah  During interviews  He turns around  And is like  Ha ha ha  Shut the fuck up  Trying to do it  While he's chuckling  But she  She doesn't seem very savvy  In the  Let's not make it seem  Like Malcolm X  Is gonna be president  Yeah  It's really  He's  You know  The problem with him 
[02:47:00]  Is hope  I'm not  Fuck hope  I don't  I'm way  I mean  Being the oldest guy  In the room  There just comes a point  Where hope doesn't  God damn work  It's nuts  I'm serious  It doesn't fucking  Work for me  It's the hope  Is the thing that I had  Hope is the best drug  A kid can have  Hope is the best drug  That you have  When you're young  Nothing beats that  That's what they push though  And that's what he's pushing  This hope of change  And prosperity  And blah blah blah  And then as soon as 
[02:47:30]  He's fucking nominated  He immediately runs back  On everything he said  Yeah  It's like a  Come on  You can't do that  But do we get  You can't fucking do that  Do we get fooled  Every time  Do we really think  Someone's gonna change  Something  No I don't  I'm really looking  For something else  An alien  Something that would  Real  Now  We are talking  Real change  It's like wow  You know something  I bet this guy  Is gonna change  Some shit  Who are you voting for 
[02:48:00]  The little green guy  With the eyes  At the top of his head  He seems fun  I think there's change  In the future  I've begun to think  That  Apple  Is actually a front  Really  Well that shit  Is so fucking  That shit that  They're coming up with  Oh yeah yeah  That fucking  iPhone  Fuck eye touch  Fucking drop movies  Into a thing this big  And I'm saying  You can't watch a movie  That big  And then I'm watching  A movie that big  It's really fucked up  Why you don't think

[02:50:30]  So it should make calls  Yeah but you make calls  Once in a while  It drops a fucking call  Once in a while  I can't  I had this really weird  Apartment location  Ten years ago  You had to use  The west side  Yeah well two years ago  I used my Verizon phone  And called everybody  Hi how are you  Just checking in  The little man with the glasses  I called him  Oh that guy  That follows you around  Helping  I love him  I can't get a cell phone  Working at my place  Ah fucking sucks  A dick  AT&T should be  Fucking firebombed  Hey uh  Sprint is the second best 
[02:51:00]  Of Verizon  No it is fucking not  Okay  You'll always get this  You'll always get this argument  There will be people  That say AT&T is the best  And other people  It goes oh my god  It's an abomination  Compared to AT&T  But the only reason  That I ended up  Even liking AT&T  Was because Sprint  Was so fucking  But I'm also talking  When you run around  The country  It's like there are patches  Where Sprint doesn't exist  T-Mobile is the worst  T-Mobile is great  In Europe  That's where it's  Actually the best  Verizon is the best 
[02:51:30]  Yeah Verizon is the best  Everyone agrees  Verizon is the best  Sprint is the second best  Because they have  The second most towers  And AT&T is coming up there  T-Mobile is the worst  AT&T  Fucking blows  I like a company  Where part of the initials  Is still telegraph  That's like  American telephone  And telegraph  You'd think they would  Change it  When was the last time  Like do they have to  Keep one guy on board  As the telegraph  Repair guy  The just in case  Some of the  Beep beep beep 
[02:52:00]  Stuff breaks down  Yeah  Change the fucking name  I just wonder  Or how the team  Means something else  Yeah it means something  Technology  Or something  Telegraph  I wonder at what point  We're gonna stop  We're gonna read the stories  About brain cancer  Associated with  Yeah  With phones  And start using them last  I mean like  We're literally gonna have  Tumors coming out of our ears  Shaped like cell phones  By the way Mike  You're saying that  As you're wearing headphones  That  Yeah  Have electromagnets

[03:05:00]  Who you're talking about  So we're gonna lead her on  A little bit  And you know  Say we're really  Into it  And yeah  We saw  And really into it  And we're hoping  For maybe a good Ramoni  Possibly yeah  Maybe a little bit  Of an interrupting interviewer  Or maybe uh  Maybe some serious phone calls  From the listeners  Alright  Be smart folks  Game on  Let's say hi  To Melissa Pickett  We'll get her on  You got her?  Yeah  We really want to talk  To Melissa  Melissa are you there? 
[03:05:30]  I am  Here I am  Hey  Melissa Pickett  Thanks for calling  The Greg and Tony show  How are you?  I'm great  Good  We were turned on to you  Because we  We saw you on that  That bull  Well we can't say the word  Dookie  The bull ass show  That Penn and Teller do  On Showtime  Uh huh  And we were fascinated  By what you  What you offer  And we felt  They kind of gave you  A bum rap comment  Uh no  I don't feel that way  Hmm  Um  I  I actually did watch 
[03:06:00]  The show in fact  Just yesterday  Yeah  And uh  Found it humorous  Yeah  The subject matter  You know  The final  Um  Place that they came to  In the show  Was  They couldn't  Dispute  Uh  Or affirm  Human  Impact  On the planet  Exactly  That's what I noticed too  And uh  I think they were making light  Of uh  Of the work that you're doing  Which um  I think is fantastic 
[03:06:30]  Helping people  In such a way  Was uh  A very noble thing  I think it's uh  Very important  Uh  To uh  Have people  Uh  Get together  And be one with nature  Like that  Well you know  I first uh  Came to  The work that I'm doing  And the focus of this  Because I had people  Coming in  To see me  And  They were complaining  Of all different kinds  Of symptoms  And as I began 
[03:07:00]  Working with them  To try to help them  Figure it out  Yes  Yes  Uh  It became apparent  That  Root issue  Was  Their  Their concern  For nature  And the environment  And the world  This was actually  Affecting them physically  It can affect them  In many different ways  That's uh  That's quite amazing  That uh  Just this  And is it a guilt thing  Eco guilt  I think you call it  Eco guilt  Is that a  Well where I see that show up  Is in people 
[03:07:30]  Not knowing what to do  And if they  If they are driving  Their vehicle  If they're  If they're feeling like  They're not doing enough  Sure  They do feel guilty  When they throw away  Trash  Yeah  Plastics  They do  They do  Comment about  I feel really guilty  I feel bad  I don't know what I can be doing  And it's really important  Not to go to a place  Of helplessness  It seems like the uh  The carbon  Footprint  People are leaving  Seems to be 
[03:08:00]  Uh  How would you say it  Um  Detrimental  Detrimental  Yes  Yes  That's a good word  Um  To everything  Right or wrong  Certainly  You know  The way that I look at it is  I can't  Exactly say  What my impact  To the planet is  Every day  Well you're helping  You're obviously helping  You're giving a hoot  Yeah 
[03:08:30]  Well I think that's  What we all have to do  In our own way  In whatever way that is  And you know  The way that I look at it is  I have to be having  Some impact  In  In the way I live  How can we have  So many people  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  No you  No you go  How about you  Because  You were  Before  I'll go  Do you want me to go  I'll ask  All right 
[03:09:00]  Go ahead  No you  No you  You're excited about  The call  Well you know  Very very  Very  We're jumping over each other  So Bob  Why don't you  Are you sure  Yeah  Okay  I'll go  I'll go  Yeah how you doing  This is Rich Voss  How are you  This is Melissa Pickett  Hi Melissa  How are you  I'm a big fan  First of all  Saw the show  And  Big fan  I just wanted to  Get into  The rocks  I mean you  You went onto the parking lot  You picked up rocks  Out of the  Out of Mother Earth 
[03:09:30]  I did  I would say  Right  And you handed them  To these people  And what does that do  Like can I just go  Have you ever tried it  No I mean  I live in Manhattan  So it would be hard  I'd have to dig up  The sidewalk  Well think of it  I'm living on one  And envision how you feel  When you go out  Into nature  What is the effect of that  Uh huh  You feel naturally  Slowed down  Right  You feel calm  Uh huh  You aren't around  A lot of hustle and bustle  So you have clear space  Yeah  What do you mean by 
[03:10:00]  Hustle and bustle  Well a lot of static around you  It's a lot of people  A lot of airwaves  A lot of radio waves  You know  Day to day life  Traffic  Horns honking  Sirens going  You know  What's the effect of all that  On the nervous system  Do you pick  You know what I've noticed  The world's gone  And gotten itself  In a big damn hurry  We are in a big hurry  That's part of the problem  We're going so fast  We're not paying attention  Yeah  Melissa  So what does a rock  In your pocket do 
[03:10:30]  The rock in the pocket  Is to help you  Remember  That there is  Something that you are  Connected to  That you've forgotten  So you feel  It kind of  It kind of  When you're living  With the daily grind  As we like to say  The rock in the pocket  Centers you a little bit  It centers you  I wasn't finished  But you go right ahead  You just  Go ahead  I didn't mean  I wasn't finished  But go ahead  Oh go ahead  Do you feel that  It's  It grounds you  And will help  Refocus you 
[03:11:00]  Or is it something  That's going to  Kind of distract you  Because your mind  Will be elsewhere  My experience is  Alright sorry about that  Go right ahead  It's centering  No no it's all about you  I didn't mean to  Actually talk on the radio  Show a part of  Go ahead  What were you saying  Centering  We'll finish this one  It's centering in what way  I feel better  Really  That's the best way to say it  I just feel better  Anytime you know  If you have  Why do people like to put  Flowers in their offices 
[03:11:30]  Yeah yeah  We all know about that  But let's get back  To what you were doing  With the rocks  Do you feel  Because a lot of people  Say that the rocks  Are a distraction  I've heard that argument  Maybe  As you say  They're centering  And I've heard  Other people say  They're a distraction  And they remove  Your focus  Because they  Put your mind  In a place  Where you're not  Focused on the task  At hand  You know  I've heard that  But  Alright go ahead  I'm sorry  Whatever you want to say  You go right ahead  Maybe we should  Just give you the mic  Okay 
[03:12:00]  It's kind of  In a way  Just a  Yeah I'm sure it is  Theoretical discussion  Because the  The truth is in the pudding  And  The truth is in the pudding  Whoa whoa whoa  What does George Harrison's head  Have to do with any of this  Yeah we  We don't understand  That whole truth is in the pudding thing  What does that really mean  It's the proof  The proof is in the pudding  It's an old saying  But what does that really mean though  The truth is in the pudding  The proof  It's in the experience  Oh okay  Sure  But  But you  Excuse me  If someone  Wants to 
[03:12:30]  Take a turn  If someone wants to find  A way  To have the best  Most functional  Fulfilling  Life  And they are  Concerned with their well-being  And how they can  Make it  We gotta  I get what you say  We gotta focus here  You're rambling in circles  Melissa Pickett  Now what is an  M-A-L-P-C  What exactly does that stand for  Licensed professional  Clinical counselor  Very nice 
[03:13:00]  Very nice  So what about the  The labyrinth  This sounds very mysterious  Almost frightening  Well there's a lot of information  On the internet  About the labyrinth  And I think people can look that up  For themselves  I'd like to know  About your labyrinth  And what that  What that means  Because when I saw it  Labyrinths  Oh they scare me  A little bit  Well try it out  See what  See what  Are yours made out of hedges  No  Or in a cornfield 
[03:13:30]  They're stones  Do you remember that scene  In The Shining  That was so scary  Oh my goodness  Right  There was the  Little  You had choices  You know  I want to go back  I know you said  I was ready  Sure you run the interview  Oh no  Go ahead  We're just guests  Go back  Because I don't think  The question is answered  No no  Well go ahead  Whatever you think there  Ted Koppel  Take us wherever you want  We're just actors  In your play  The  For people who are looking  For a way to  Have a healthy 
[03:14:00]  Happy life  Sure  We're on this point again  Go ahead  Whatever  Whatever way  They can find  To make connection  With some deeper  Part of themselves  Is what I encourage  Right  Okay  Should we go back anymore  What else did we do wrong  Apparently we're not  Asking questions  Of your satisfaction  Go right ahead  It's all about you  You  Go ahead  Go ahead  Welcome to the  Melissa Pickett Show  Go  I think Melissa  Is making some  Fine  Valid points here  This is  Because I've noticed  Melissa  I've noticed  I feel  Terrible  When I use  Certain things 
[03:14:30]  That I know  Are going to be  In a landfill  For a long time  These are  These things affect me  What can I do  To make myself  Feel better  About this  Pay attention  To how you live  And do the little  Things  Melissa  I'm feeling  Ego guilt  I'm sorry  Yeah this is  This is  Ted  Melissa  He's  Please bear with us  He's a bit slow  I try to be  Environmentally conscious  And yet I find myself  Leaving a bigger  Carbon footprint  Than I intended  On leaving  We feel like all voices 
[03:15:00]  Should be heard  On our show  So Ted's a bit slow  But his point  Is just as important  So please listen  To Ted  Melissa  What can I do  To help lighten  My carbon footprint  That will be your turn  To answer the question  Because I tend  I tend  To do things like  When flowers are blooming  I'll pour gasoline  On them  Well that's not  Very eco-friendly  No that's not  Melissa  Melissa 
[03:15:30]  Yeah  You're not answering  My questions  I need help  What could you  Tell Ted today  Ted's  Yeah Ted's a little  You know  Melissa  I'd say  Ted's a little  Stressed out  Yeah a little bit  Alright let's go  To our phone calls  They've been  Wanting to  Talk to you  All morning here  Let's start  With Bob  In Connecticut  Bob you're on  With Melissa Pickett  She's an  Eco-therapist  Hi good morning 
[03:16:00]  Greg and Tony  Love the show  Long time  Listen  Oh thank you  Thank you Bob  Thank you  Miss Pickett  Mrs. Pickett  I'm sorry  Excuse me  I'm not familiar  With your work  I'm not sure  If you're married  Or not  But I have  This tremendous  Eco-guilt  Anytime I use  The bathroom  To the point  That I forced  Myself  To contain  My bowel  Movement  For the last  Two weeks  It's becoming  Extremely uncomfortable  And all I can do  All day  Is daydream  About taking  A giant  A giant  Eating shit 
[03:16:30]  Booyah  Wow  Booyah  Melissa  We're gonna have to  Beep that  Yeah  They beeped it  Down the hall  But he makes  A very good point  Because you know  When you're  Doing that  How do we  Explain it  On the radio  When you wake up  In the morning  And you do that  Isn't that  Wrecking the environment  In a way  The concern 
[03:17:00]  That people  Might have  With that  Is the use  Of water  For example  We live in a  Drought area here  And we had  People who were  Very concerned  Literally  With their  Toilet flushes  Because they  Were concerned  About conservation  Of the water  And not having  It  And  You know  That became  A concern  For people  In New Orleans  Oh of course  That became  A concern  For people  In Atlanta 
[03:17:30]  But they had  Plenty of water  In New Orleans  It's  Not drinkable  Oh  So you know  I got confused  Because you were  Talking about a drought  Water is  A  The nectar of life  We don't have water  We can't exist  Oh I like that  Nectar of life  Wait a minute  If you don't have  Water you can't exist  No  No not at all  Wow  Are you suggesting  We raise a generation  Of super kids  I'm suggesting  We raise a generation  Of conscious  Kids  Sure  And should we 
[03:18:00]  Give kids rocks  Like if you give  Should you give  Your kids rocks  Or is that  Would that be  For like adults  Or is that a certain age  Or can that help  Kids too  I suggest we take  Kids out into our park  Yeah  Camping  We give them  Experiences  We get them  Off the TVs  And the computers  Where did Jimmy go  Melissa  We got a soldier  That came back  From Iraq  And this  I've been following  The green movement  And this has come up  A few times 
[03:18:30]  Rich in Colorado  What do you have  For Melissa Pickett  The eco-therapist  Hi Melissa  I'm a huge fan of yours  I saw your show  Well I saw you  On Penn and Teller  And I saw your little  Labyrinth  The rock garden  And it reminded me  Of when I was in Baghdad  For 15 months  And I was walking around  In circles there  Kind of doing  Doing useless stuff  But the question I have  Is I was driving  You know those big  Huge Humvees around  Which put all  The carbon footprint stuff  And I was wondering  How much of a carbon footprint  Do IEDs leave  I have no idea 
[03:19:00]  I'm not an environmentalist  So you'd have to  Go on the website  Figure that out for yourself  But you would imagine  Melissa  There would be a lot of  IEDs  There's a lot of smoke  And stuff  And a lot of parts  From trucks flying around  I was just wondering  Like what would you guess  Like ballpark figure  What are we talking  I have no idea  Because I'm not an expert  In that area  Alright but the point  Being Melissa  That I'm sure  That would bring on  A lot of guilt  If you're one of these  Soldiers that  Is fighting the  Good fight over  In Iraq 
[03:19:30]  And Afghanistan  Yeah  I would hope  That we would all  Just send  A good words  And a blessing  Of support  For being over there  Let's support  How we can  We're running out of time  Because we've got to  Take a break  For the NPR news  But first we've got  Steve from  Where is he from  Yellow  Something yellow  Yellow  Yellowstone  Hello  Yes you're on  With Melissa Pickett  Steve  I have a bad connection 
[03:20:00]  May I speak with  Miss Pickett  You're on the line  With Miss Pickett  Hello  Melissa  Hello I'm here  I think that a lot  Of people don't  Seem to take  The environment  Seriously  I don't think  That they understand  That their impact  Like people don't  Feel as individuals  Like because I  Personally had my  Stomach stapled  And yet I didn't  Change the problems  Inside that made  Me do that to  Begin with  And I find  That what's really  Been happening  Is people don't  Seem to understand  The impact we have  On the earth 
[03:20:30]  That one person  Can make a difference  I hope that we all  Are all waking up  So this one's  Going to probably  Understand that  What's that  I'm sorry  I said I hope  I hope that you're  Doing your part  To help people  Understand that  Well I find that  It might sound crazy  But I'm not drinking  Really bottled water  Anymore  I'm drinking tap water  Because I don't want  To continually  Use all the bottles  And the plastic  Which I don't believe  Are recycled properly  That's probably true  Could you elaborate  On what else I could do 
[03:21:00]  Because I'm  Feeling like  I just don't know  But I really do want  To contribute  And participate  Accurately  And I'm really  Worried about this  One though  Because again  It always hurts  My throat  And yet it plays  Funny on the air  So what do you  Think I could be  Doing differently  Add to what you're  Doing  Ramone  Ramone  Someone leave a carbon  Ball print  On this bitch's  Nose bridge  Ramone  Melissa carries rocks  Under her clit hood 
[03:21:30]  Ramone  Melissa should be chased  Through a labyrinth  By a bleeding  Aged patient  Ramone  I really know  I really know  People that are listening  I hope that people  Are listening  Will allow  In whatever way  That they can  To know that they  Can make a difference  Ramone  Ramone  Melissa  Pickett  It's dirty 
[03:22:00]  Asshole  Are you finished  Yes that's all  I wanted to say  But I really do  Want to know  What you think  I might be doing  Better  To help the  Environment  Oh my goodness  You know  It never fails  Caller gets through  And uh  She didn't answer  My question  We couldn't  We couldn't  Cut it off  Quickly enough  I'm so sorry  Melissa  That uh  Sometimes these  Callers get through  And they just  Want to make jokes  I have no need 
[03:22:30]  To apologize  Let's just  Let's  Allow that  Anyone listening  To this show  In their heart  Of hearts  Make their own  Decision  About what's  Happening out there  How it's  Affecting them  And let them  Know that  Goddamn rich  Cunt  We're all human  And we're all  Sharing in  The world  Together  Goddamn rich  Cunt  Yeah  I hear ya  It makes good  Sense  It sure does 
[03:23:00]  Melissa  Hello  Hello  Yeah  Yeah  Okay  Wasn't sure  Any other  Any other  Questions  Or any other  Callers  Yeah we have  Plenty of  Calls coming  Yeah  Why don't we  This is a very  Good question  Coming in from  Steve in  Union  New Jersey  Steve  Hi Melissa  How are you  Doing today  Good  How are you  I'm excellent  I realize my  Ideas might not  Be 100% 
[03:23:30]  Orthodox  But I was  Really wondering  What you thought  About marijuana  See I believe  That that comes  From nature  And it's very  Difficult for me  To be centered  When I'm not  Really big  So what's your  Question  Comment  My question is  How do you  Think that helps  The eco footprint  Because I mean  I'm planting a lot  Of trees here  In New Jersey  And you know  It's helping people  Get centered in their  Lives  I was just  Wondering what  You think about  That  She's not an  Expert on that  Are you 
[03:24:00]  Feeling a bit  Of guilt  Because you're  Smoking the  Weed Steve  Oh not at all  Not at all  Melissa can I  Ask you something  Yeah  Of course  We're concentrating  Here on the  United States  But there  Seems to be  A lot of  I don't know  It's almost  Eco crimes  Going on  In other  Countries  You understand  What I  Mean  So it's  Kind of  Hard  For us  To do  Something  Knowing that 
[03:24:30]  Other countries  Are just  Screwing up by the  Numbers here  You know  I don't think it's  Just a United States  Problem  It's a world  Problem  It is a world  Problem  And we got  You know  To the south  We have  Mexico  Just pumping out  Pollutants  And to the north  We got just  Moronic  Stupid ass  Canadians  That just don't  Know anything  About anything  To tell you the  Truth  That brings a lot 
[03:25:00]  Of stress and  Guilt  Yes  A lot of guilt  I mean they're like  Our retarded  Neighbors to the north  That have to be  Cared for and  Coddled  As they ruin the  Planet  Sure  We got Uncle Paul  Checking in  Uncle Paul  You're on with  Melissa Pickett  The ecotherapist  Hello  This is Paul  Hello  How are you  You know  I teach  Children  And what is it  It seems it's  Very hard to get  An eco  Responsible  Message  Through  To younger 
[03:25:30]  People  Because it all  Starts at home  With the  Interfering  Parents  That's true  And what is  The best way  Do you think  To try to get  That message  To children  Because I deal  With the  Very young  Kids  And it's  Very hard  Because they  Don't understand  Consequences  Or what  Tattling can  Do to somebody  So exactly  What is it  How do you  Make that  Fun for children  Meet children  Where they are

[03:31:00]  That's when he operates  That's when they're available  Okay  So what's the problem  Then Jimmy  They're only doing  He only has  Afternoons available  The hospital's not available  Okay  It's at the hospital  The eye ear  And whatever place  So they say  Oh wait  Maybe I should turn  Your mic off  Hold on  You can't eat  After midnight  You can't eat  After midnight  You can't  Or else  You turn into  A bad gremlin  Yeah  You turn into pub  Yes  So I said  Well he operates  In the morning too  And she said yes  And that's the same rules  So I'm like  Well if he operates 
[03:31:30]  At 8 in the morning  And you can't eat  After midnight  That's cool  That's about 8 hours  You have to be empty  But if he's operating  But if he's operating  At 1.30 in the afternoon  Why is it still midnight  And she's this  Fucking woman  Just keeps saying  You can't eat  After midnight  Hey bitch  I speak English  I know the language  I heard what you said  But I'm like  Well what's the difference  Why would I have to wait  13 and a half hours  Right  If it's acceptable  When he operates  In the morning  For me to wait  8 hours  And this fucking dummy  Can't answer my question 
[03:32:00]  Of course she can  She's programmed to go  Don't eat after midnight  How stupid are you  She's got a sign  In front of her  That says  Whatever she says  She doesn't understand  That time can change  Like that  Midnight is not a medical term  Yeah  If your procedure  Is a little later  In the day  It's still midnight  Good idea Scott  Fucking irritating  Christ  God almighty  Is that fucking annoying  Of course it's annoying  She just kept saying it 
[03:32:30]  And I said  What's the earliest  He operates  Where you can't  She goes  What difference  Does it make  And I'm like  Well I know  What the hour separation is  Right  Fucking stupid asshole  Oh  You know what  She's doing the best she can  I mean it's all that matters  Whatever I eat  I eat  I'm not gonna starve  To death  I live in this country  So therefore we have  Good medical  Uh  Uh  Fuck her  What happened  Nothing's a bit we do  I know  I was trying to play along  I'm just irritated  I wasn't being serious  Jimmy that's just bad timing

[03:34:30]  You can't eat  Is because of  The fact that  All your food  Has to be digested  No no no  I understand that  Oh boy  Jimmy listen  For just a second  Listen  I'm not complaining  Get into the bunkers  Get into the bunkers  I'm not even mad  Dude I know that  I am  I don't mind  Keith  Do the math  That's what  Jimmy is trying  To figure out  How many hours  That's why  You can't eat  You know what  12 hours  Is too long  It should only  Be like 8 hours  That's what  We're getting at  So shouldn't  He be able 
[03:35:00]  To eat  Until 4 or 5  In the morning  Of course he should  That's why  You should just  Talk directly  To your doctor  Your doctor  Will let you know  Are you guys  Ever gonna do  A virus tour  Out here in California  Thanks to Mike  We're not doing anymore  Sorry  Thanks to Mike  Sorry everybody  I love you guys  You guys are the best  I ruined it  Jimmy I had a  I had a thing  Love your girlfriend  Anthony  Oh thanks  Yeah  Everyone's fantastic  I always seem  I hung up on it  At that point  I had this thing 
[03:35:30]  Cause you know  I take a pill  I take Klonopin  For sleepwalking  Cause I have  A sleepwalking disorder  And it's dangerous  If I don't take it  And I had this thing  Where New York doctors  They have so many patients  It's hard to get them  On the phone  And I was talking  To  I was on tour  And I needed  This drug prescribed  And she literally  She goes  I can't  I can't do that  From a long distance  There's just nothing  I can do  I was like  Literally  I could jump out  My window  In my sleep 
[03:36:00]  If I don't have a drug  And she was like  Mike what's going on  With you  Are you  Are you abusing  This drug  I was like  My doctor doesn't  Even know me  Like I'm having  This conversation  With a stranger  And I'm like  I really need  This fucking drug  It's an  Being in New York  Is awful  Because if we lived  In the suburbs  Somewhere  We'd have a local doctor  You know the person well  Well we have a doctor  For you my friend  Do you really  Oh yeah  Who's that  Who Steve  Who  I'm not mentioning  Any names  We've got a doctor 
[03:36:30]  For you  Alright  Great  Who needs  To actually go  To an office  Where you can explain  What's wrong  With you on a phone  Phone  You can do it  On I am  AOL  I'm so annoyed  This woman  We're just fucking around  God  So what are you gonna do  You're gonna get  You're gonna call your doctor  And find out when you get  Whatever  She said don't call me  I'm annoyed  This isn't gonna be  A morning procedure  Yeah  You just wanted to get it over with  Sure  Cause you're gonna sleep  And you wake up  Now you're  Now you gotta wait  I gotta do fucking radio 
[03:37:00]  Just get a little nervous  You know what I'm thinking  Radio wants to take the day off tomorrow  Jimmy get ready for the big op  It's a little nervous  Get ready for the big op  I know it's a treat for everyone  When I'm not here  But I'm  No I'm coming  No no  It's not  Oh Jimmy  Everyone says how much better the show is  That's not where we're getting at Jimmy  We just think you should take a day off  And get ready for the big op  I'm gonna be belligerent and be here  Everybody's gonna have to fucking look  Too bad  Incidentally my biggest 
[03:37:30]  My biggest applause in my show  In my set on the virus show  Yeah  Was when I said  You guys like Jim Norton?  Oh yeah  And then they cheered  And then I dropped the mic  That was my closer  Yeah  Jimmy  I'm a doctor  It's eight hours  Of course  Yeah  Hold on a minute  Jimmy's gonna sound like this  When he comes back  Hi  It's gonna be all different voice  Oh that'd be hilarious if it changed his voice  Is that gonna be weird if it changes his fucking voice?  Hey  Hey how you guys doing? 
[03:38:00]  Yeah  Oh no  It gives you some wacky voice  And you gotta  Fucking get AIDS  You gotta start writing wacky material for your wacky voice  You're gonna put a surgical glove on your head and blow it up with your nose?  I hope he comes back with one of those deep voices baby  Yeah  Yeah baby  I want you to shit in my mouth baby  Let's see what Jim in Philly has for Jimmy Norton  Jim  Hey gang  I just have the answer for Jimmy 
[03:38:30]  It's eight hours  Thank you  Who the fuck is he?  Holy shit  Alright some dude that's saying he's a doctor  That should be good enough  Let's go to Paul  That's your new doctor  Yeah  Paul  It's like eight hours  Paul  Hey what's going on guys  Jimmy listen  I want to tell you about the anesthesia  Okay  Alright  I'll give you a simple analogy  I saw pharmaceuticals  The analogy is basically  If you're in like a state of death  When somebody dies  All their bodily fluids get released before they die 
[03:39:00]  It's very common  So  The reason they don't want you to eat too close to the anesthesia  Because anesthesia takes your body and your brain  Almost to a state of death  Almost  So what happens is  You actually  You could release some bodily fluids  So I recommend you eat like  A big like ribeye steak  And some mashed potatoes  Like right before you go in  So when they put you under  You just shit your pants  Because that's exactly what's going to happen to you  But it's not about dying though right  No you're not going to die  I mean if they overdose for the anesthesia  Yeah you could be dead  But you know  Yeah he shows real confidence 
[03:39:30]  Yeah also I love a guy that confines  Yeah  It says death  It has to do with  It's silly  It has to do with vomiting and stuff  Sometimes you have a reaction  That's all  They don't want you vomiting and choking on it  All of the equipment  Yeah  And when you come out of it  You'll puke too  They don't want you puke when you come out of it  It's better to come out of the anesthesia  If you have nothing in your stomach  I may or may not puke  Jimmy I got a carpenter on the line  He says it's definitely eight hours  So you're okay  All right  How long is it though? 
[03:40:00]  It really is eight hours  I'm teasing of course  Just the fact that she  Wanted Jimmy to just come  Right  Just the fact that she wouldn't say  Enough about the anesthesia  Just the fact that she wouldn't say  It's about eight hours  The fact that this fucking parrot  Idiot  Kept holding on to midnight  What is midnight magic time?  It's magical  Motherfucker  If you ate at 12.01  They couldn't do the surgery  What if he switched the operation  At 6 p.m  Is it midnight still the magic time?  Midnight  The body knows what midnight says  God damn it  What if the surgery was at midnight? 
[03:40:30]  What does she say?  It's either 24 hours  Or zero seconds  Right  You actually have to eat  As you're going under  You go under with a fucking  Hamish sandwich  Stick it out of your mouth  Dummy  I hate her too Jimmy  Just for you  God I wanted to do it  Jimmy how are we going to get a hold of you  To make sure you're okay and all  I'll tell you  I want to be photographed  As soon as I'm done  And then I'll probably  Believe it or not  I'll call that fucking  917 number  And leave an update  While I'm still fucked up  That's good 
[03:41:00]  We need some pictures of you  With a puffy nose  Send a picture to me  I'll be bleeding badly  Will ya?  From the vagina?  No  No  No  No I'm a plugger  Asshole  You wear a  Like a little gauze mustache  And you bleed profusely  Nice  Profusely  Oh really?  And you puke  Because you're swallowing blood  Oh  It's going on the back of your throat  You can't breathe  On your nose  Oh  Wow  That's wonderful  What's that line  You can swallow a pint of blood  Before you vomit 
[03:41:30]  How long are you going to be like that for?  Three years  Three  Is this a  Is this a  Is it a necessary surgery?  Or is it like  Yeah it's ruining my life  I can't breathe  Yeah  I can't breathe  It sucks  I can't sleep  Yeah it's horrible  You have sleep apnea?  I'm always stuffy  Yeah  My fucking turbinates  You what?  If I had a gun  I would have shot myself  I would have blasted through the  Really?  Just try to shoot a couple?

[03:42:00]  What those are  Until your doctor told me  He was wrong  And now you're like  Fucking turbinates  Well Big Kev actually told me  Our friend  Who had the surgery  And they're these things  That regulate air temperature  And fun story guys  They regulate air flow  Through your nose  And when they swell  You can't get air in  Well you know  Quinn sleeps with that  Fucking mask  Exactly  That fucking  Darth Vader mask  Yeah  Wow  Wow  What are you gonna do  I gotta go to bed  I gotta put my mask on  Put the mask on  I'm gonna dream about school  That's great

[03:43:00]  You gotta take  They said  Wait so  Are they worried about you puking  And then because you're under  That you're gonna just like  Choke to death  Exactly  That you'll puke into the tube  And then you'll die  I also love  Like why  Why did you need a strawberry  Like just one single strawberry  Yeah what are you  At the end of Fearless  You Jeff Bridges  I was starving  You're just like  That's it  I'm having a strawberry  My fucking headphones  Oh  Bobby
