<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts expressing burnout and disillusionment with their careers, reflecting on past successes and their role in propelling other comedians like Colin Quinn and Louis C.K.  A listener's comment about Jimmy Norton's absent name in the show's intro led to a discussion about updating it.  The conversation then veered into a scathing critique of the Broadway production of "The Bridges of Madison County," punctuated by sarcastic commentary on clips from a Broadway Channel interview with the cast.  Listener calls added to the negativity, focusing on the show's perceived flaws.  The hosts abruptly shifted to a recent Florida movie theater shooting, sparked by a texting dispute, leading to a discussion of disruptive moviegoers, with callers sharing anecdotes—one involving a woman using a vibrator in a theater.  The segment ended with discussions of the upcoming Lego Movie, Doctor Who (including its history), and a clip of a classic Doctor Who episode, interspersed with humorous and often vulgar listener calls.

The show continued with a discussion about the Winter Olympics, focusing on curling, and a nostalgic reminiscence about ABC's Wide World of Sports, particularly the "Agony of Defeat" segment. This transitioned into a conversation about Will Ferrell's Dodge Durango commercials, the effectiveness of celebrity endorsements, and irritating commercials (Geico Gecko, Progressive's Flo, particularly the "Hump Day" Geico commercial).  This segued into a discussion of memorable PSAs, including a graphic New Zealand anti-speeding PSA, and insights from a Progressive employee about the Flo commercials' popularity.  A racist, yet humorous, vintage Jell-O commercial was also discussed. More PSAs were analyzed, including a Canadian domestic violence PSA and a testicular cancer PSA featuring a scrotum on ice, along with a graphic Irish drunk-driving PSA.  A substantial portion of the show focused on a news story about the "Philly Cheese Guy," a man exposing himself while holding Swiss cheese, with numerous pun-filled listener calls and host commentary. The segment concluded with more cheese jokes and a brief mention of upcoming Opie and Anthony merchandise (t-shirts) and a potential Seinfeld-related project.

The next segment began with a bizarre, nonsensical continuation of cheese jokes before abruptly shifting to a mock interview with a self-proclaimed, extremely vulgar and aggressive mafia hitman, "Lyle Chipperson," who was ultimately dismissed.  The show then discussed various pop culture figures. A humorous Vine video of a Beyoncé fan's poor singing was played, followed by extensive, offensive commentary about Gabourey Sidibe's weight.  This led to a discussion of Mike Tyson's autobiography, focusing on his drug use and financial problems.  Evander Holyfield's appearance on Celebrity Big Brother UK and his homophobic statements were discussed, along with a video of Kanye West punching a man who allegedly used racial slurs towards Kim Kardashian.  A significant part focused on "living dolls"—men dressed in full-body suits resembling dolls—with an interview excerpt from a UK talk show, including sexually explicit and vulgar commentary. The segment concluded with a video of a couple engaging in oral sex and analingus, accompanied by crude commentary, followed by a caller’s account of a near-mall shooting and a lack of security response, and then ending with brief discussion of dental work, physical ailments and a Kardashian's pet.

The final segment discussed an incident at a mall where a girlfriend was working, highlighting a lack of response from mall security.  This transitioned into promoting Jimmy Norton's upcoming stand-up comedy shows in various cities (Atlanta, DC, Atlantic City – Borgata, and Pittsburgh), providing ticket information. The hosts briefly discussed an upcoming film shoot, expressing a preference for filming in Boston despite booking difficulties.  The show concluded with the closing announcement and a mention of a post-show segment with Sam Roberts.

[00:06:30]  and i couldn't fucking believe it i was cracking up oh my i hope it's a musical  so now opie let's see how much you love your wife you said you would sit through uh a shitty movie  will you sit through that but i but she was she's not the type of person i would go  want to see something like that can i put my film in your refrigerator right i need to put my film  in your refrigerator can you imagine seeing bridges of madison county on broadway  uh oh my lord a big chorus line with girls the bridges of madison county oh they come out on the 
[00:07:00]  stage it's all shitty you know it's just going to be one of those extremely slow moving yeah  broadway show where the lights just slowly fade in over here yeah yeah and then that scene's over  and then you think minimalist over here not a lot of sense just like oh god just like a silhouette  of of a bridge behind him horrible he's taking pictures oh well i mean are they gonna have 
[00:07:30]  different bridges that they set up oh that's so oh my god what's wrong with those people my head is  swimming thinking about the horror it won't be a bridge though it'll be like a picture in the  background of a bridge oh it'll be so terrible and they'll change every so often i don't know i think  they're gonna actually they'll figure out a bridge i think they'll do like i think they'll figure out  a bridge productions where a machine brings a bridge in it rolls as they're having a scene over here  they're setting up that bridge for the big reveal that's good yuck and the audience goes like oh 
[00:08:00]  look they brought a bridge right here on stage if they don't have an actual bridge on stage that  that show's gonna be a bust i hate it and i'm sure they'll have younger uh people in it they're not  gonna have fucking an old guy like clint eastwood with his fucking baloney tits oh and the tony for best  you know we wanted to bring the essence of the bridge to the broadway stage and i gotta say the 
[00:08:30]  get the fuck out of here music all right rob you just ruined our morning yes you totally ruined my  morning i didn't think it could get worse with that whole fucking thing i was in a good a new  musical it is a musical it is oh no what oh and just like i said look they're going with the young  fucking clint eastwood of course they are dude what are the songs i gotta a chat with kelly and 
[00:09:00]  steve all right we're setting the romance to music dude wait wait start with the first one we're in  this video you just gave us 20 minutes rob thank you you need to see this all right bye rob madison  county uh bridges of madison county a musical gonna be on broadway soon based on the novel by  robert james waller all right here we go the broadway channel sat down with four-time tony nominee  kelly o'hara and screen star stephen pasquale as they talk about broadway's new romantic musical 
[00:09:30]  from the best selling isn't that uh huh isn't that uh what's his name oh oh yeah he was in uh  the dennis leary thing uh rescue me or or the other one where it was now he's a photographer  pictures of bridges that's a dennis leary guy yeah i think so we don't have to look up his wikipedia go 
[00:10:00]  ahead bridges of madison county and what's beautiful about the musical is that it's really  ultimately a two-hander it's a story of these two people at its heart in this big beautiful broadway  musical form um but i think for from an audience perspective it's an insanely relatable no piece  you are either francesca or you are robert or russ budd who's budd in terms of the people you relate  to of course everybody's marge the neighbor who's gossiping  and a lot of other people relate to this triangle so um oh this poor guy doesn't want to be doing 
[00:10:30]  this speaking to people save this guy yeah having sat in the audience i realized i think i was nervous  especially about francesca she's making the choice oh is she the most difficult choice yeah what's the  choice her family to do what i was so surprised at how on board the audience is i remember reading the  book and being on board being on worked on the team of francesca and robert right which i rooting for  them which i would never have imagined i would have been but no you see a love like that and you say 
[00:11:00]  i don't know just go for it and what and then the choices that come after is there a love story in  there i have no idea man did i draw a blank i thought merle streep and clint eastward were just  hooking up just hooking up and just hooking up while he was in town taking pictures of the bridges  bridges wow that sounds horrendous hold on we got larry king uh checking in thank god larry  hey fellas how important are the bridges oh well yes larry king thinks it's a story about dentistry 
[00:11:30]  very good uh hey this guy is great this next caller is really this is good yeah yeah absolutely pat in  pennsylvania pat hey boys how's it going hell out hey uh instead of the bridges of madison county  comes to broadway what about the bridges of new jersey and start with uh chris christie  fucking phones i'm sorry dude you broke up oh okay hey instead of the bridges of madison county

[00:13:30]  and green and a child in a village i passed through now picture you're sitting the bridge  oh my god he has to talk about us to understand how open the world was in 1965 in iowa  oh my god 
[00:14:00]  now you're sitting you got your playbill in your hand was looking around the room which is just  wanting to shoot yourself like a new yorker it shouldn't sound contemporary it shouldn't sound  like all the things that i do reflexively know what you're doing the whole time you're looking  at the playbill to see how many more fucking chapters or whatever and then you're like oh my god we're not 
[00:14:30]  even at half time so even at its most sort of full and active it never feels very populated  uh i'll be right back i'm gonna go grab a drink i'll be right back i'll be right back  that's what i'd be yeah i'm gonna go to the bar you want anything yeah i'll be no i gotta take a piss real bad  okay excuse me excuse me excuse me yeah i'm sorry excuse me i'm not coming back  oh it's kicks in now the bridges of madison county i wanted to oh what did you want to do 
[00:15:00]  i wanted to write a show that the music and the story together would make people feel something very  deep and very boredom and to think about suicide the choices that they make in their lives and the  choice to go to that show and make in their lives regret is there one brain cell in your head  that relates to this there isn't a brain cell in my body where where you would sit down and 
[00:15:30]  figure out the music for what the bridges of madison county what they want and what they are what  they and that struggle is struggle is something that everyone in the audience can respond oh no and  who am i and what is the gulf between those two things oh this i i am so annoyed that this exists  i'm annoyed that this exists we've been on the rest of this video i need to be mad he's gonna keep 
[00:16:00]  talking about the music oh but we get little interludes of uh the wonderful boy it certainly is a  up-tempo kind of fun music you could really tap your toe to oh god who am i and what is the gulf  between those two things there is one thing that's eternal the show is eternal just sit there 
[00:16:30]  there is one thing that remains forever and it's just a shitty song is this is this where the lead  guy stands singing out to the audience of course she's and she's doing something like to the side  she's washing his under underpants she's washing out the shit stains in the background  or or is it the one where he's kind of hugging her and singing into her face  no at the end they do like the both sing together i think this guy's reflecting and singing to the 
[00:17:00]  audience wow and she's in the corner doing some washing and then at one moment she's washing and  then she she looks up like like she senses he's singing those songs and then the bridge is illuminated  in the background the bridge you gotta make sure that bridge is always around gotta make sure my god  i can't stand this they're just gonna just light the bridge in different ways yes i bet you there'll be  some kind of sunset lighting oh of course there will yuck at some point and then the bridge under the 
[00:17:30]  stars oh fuck it the bridge is gonna come up from under the stage under the stage and just rise  yes behind them that's silly oh that bridge is fucking just sitting there that's like the vocals is like  kind of oh the curtain goes down and you finally get a drink well needed fucking drink uh keep going 
[00:18:00]  oh no can we move on to the next video though no  it's such breathing past the beating of my heart it will all fade away what this makes no sense  oh it all fades away 
[00:18:30]  oh my god all right it all fades away someone got lazy with their writing  i wanted very much to write a grown-up show and i think that's what we did that's right a grown-up  show yeah unlike those big hits on broadway who the hell would ever want to grow up this is terrible 
[00:19:00]  this is you wouldn't enjoy this oh my god whatever the opposite of enjoy is the antithesis  the bridges of medicine all right is that it for the videos new musical oh no how many more videos  we got it's gotta be another one right what's meet the stars that could be it you're the latest thank  god tickets tickets we did that one all right we're good man i want to get to know we did that one  already we did that already wait what theater is it playing in i don't know is this really going 
[00:19:30]  down when oh no there are more oh what are you talking about there's more no these are just the  songs we're not listening to the songs oh this must be is this the overture when you're sitting down 
[00:20:00]  the lights dimmed and everyone's like what was i saying before about being lost  oh the thing is i knew where i was but not where i was going oh god it's nice white  why did i walk those mountains why did i ride those ships what's that why did i watch those horses  running wild running wild now i know the bridges now now i know he knows now what is it why 
[00:20:30]  all right all right all right i've had it people i've had it i want to hear the rest of that it's  lovely and i did a little research uh steven pasquale who i guess is the clint eastwood character in this 
[00:21:00]  uh-huh he's from rescue me yeah he did cool shit well now he's doing this he's showing how these  multi-faceted uh-huh falling into you is the name of the song well that's what giant pussy  maybe that'd be great if this whole thing was just a euphemism for her giant unpleasant box  the covered bridges are like a big snatch he's driving into staring into a cesspool that has white  milky stuff on the outside of it and a giant wig that i asked you to trim and you didn't 
[00:21:30]  oh the well that i go into the water but my bucket will not stay hard because the smell from the  well is disgusting and the two little trees above it are droopy you pig holy shit  we gotta we gotta go we just gotta go oh my god show field trip to bridges and madison county 
[00:22:00]  how far into it do we look around at each other and think what a bad idea this was  i can't imagine it's good for five minutes i can't imagine i cannot fuck it i guess it's always cool  when you see the setting go oh wow that's impressive and then after that you're like all right let's get  the fuck out of here the demo for this has to be like old women old ladies i think you need a dry  pussy to go to this yes menopause you have to go through menopause and all you got left is  reflecting that's yeah it's all reflect right because they got left to all this reflection right 
[00:22:30]  ah yuck you think 70 year old broads are going home and masturbating to this after this oh they think  oh it just brought back such memories i wish my husband was like this yes like the photographer  character why they were so passionate you think this fights on the way home why can't you be more  like the photographer character shut the fuck up i took you to your goddamn show now leave me the 
[00:23:00]  fuck alone there right there isn't that enough and you're still bitching at me what else do you want  from me i just want a little romance like in the show romance did you see the love that built between  them in such a short time and it i'm short time i wish this was a short time i've been with you for  30 fucking years fast forward those two will be miserable too right she'll be dragging his dumb ass 
[00:23:30]  to his show right and not one moment of pleasure you know how much goddamn traffic there was to get  this stupid show now i have to sit on the bqe for the rest of the fucking night right thanks for  nothing can you give me some goddamn peace and quiet just fucking rude she had a moment right where she  fucking thought of the the romance again i miss um coming in on the long island railroad yeah on 
[00:24:00]  wednesdays i think it was where it was oh matinee day filled with fucking blue hairs all these old  women going in for the broadway shows yeah and they all had deeper voices than me because all their  left their body yeah no more and they smoke oh my god they were so manly what a performance  i swear that's exactly how they sounded and man when we got into penn station they couldn't get out 
[00:24:30]  of the train fast enough to start their broadway day their various perfumes clashing oh that horrendous  flowery flowery stuff and the one that smells like raid there's a perfume that old ladies wear that  smells like fucking raid ant and roach spray there's one that will just dry you out smelling it you know that  one yeah it's uh i don't know if it's lilac terrible or fucking it's horrendous i wish it would cause 
[00:25:00]  spontaneous combustion i gotta put a little vanilla in that yeah throw some vanilla vanilla in your  perfume what the with these dry flowers and then there's literally a point where old people  doesn't matter what they do they just smell like mothballs yeah it's like a mothball smell  usually see that with somebody picking up a shitload of prescriptions at the pharmacy  mm-hmm oh it's he's past the mothball phase when it has this show started yet there sam roberts  um i guess it don't matter it's a dumb question what theater is it though oh actually i think it

[00:32:30]  and um i guess he was sitting there and then this other guy in front of him with his wife is uh he's  texting you know people text sure during the previews which i guess there is an acceptability  to texting during the previews but then you got that stress like are they going to continue when the  movie starts oh this fucking guy the light from the text is getting wet whatever was the guy being 
[00:33:00]  loud or just texting um i i i heard texting texting yeah i guess he was annoying there's something so  annoying when someone does that like even if you just make your eyes go back to it you're like this  mother was the guy sitting next to him the light comes up he's sitting yeah so you probably see it  in his field of gotcha yeah yeah yeah so then uh i guess this guy got uh he said something to him  got up left the theater well they added to an argument i mean he said a couple things probably 
[00:33:30]  uh somebody throws popcorn i'm not sure who threw the pop that was already well into it yeah  because he he left the theater well i'm trying to follow the story here he left the theater but  when he came back the guy that was texting and stuff said oh what did you do tell on me you're  gonna get me kicked out right and the guy said uh you know they got a little altercation at that  point and that's when the popcorn went flying oh okay yeah and then that's when the uh 71 year old  shot the guy wow his wife tried to pull a superhero move right thrust her hand in front of the bullet 
[00:34:00]  went through her hand right into the guy he was texting with his three-year-old daughter though  yeah i guess uh yeah three-year-old daughters at home yeah he's texting one of the guy was drunk the  other guy i mean you know i think he snapped he shot him he just sat down put the gun on his lap and  just sat there waited for authorities he probably couldn't really he had just done it yeah and the 
[00:34:30]  old guy was there because it was his birthday treat was he alone or was with people wait let me read  some of this birthday treat in the blanks an argument over texting in a florida movie theater monday  triggered a retired tampa police captain to fatally shoot a man sitting in front of him as about 25  horrified moviegoers looked on clusky somebody throws popcorn i'm not sure who threw the popcorn  said charles cummings who as a birthday treat was about to watch the movie the lone survivor  and then bang he was shot curtis reeves 71 has been charged for second degree murder it's not 
[00:35:00]  immediately clear whether he has retained an attorney uh it happened when reeves asked 43 year old chad  olsen chad to stop texting at the theater uh reeves and his wife were sitting behind olsen and his  wife olsen told reeves that he was texting with his three-year-old daughter isn't that weird reeves  played superman right and in superman jimmy olsen was the photographer 
[00:35:30]  also told me he was texting this this article's written really badly yeah are you able to follow this  yeah a little bit a little bit yeah i uh i think i'm getting it the sheriff said the shooting  happened when reeves asked 43 year old chad olsen to stop texting at the theater reeves and his wife  were sitting behind olsen and his wife olsen told reeves that he was texting with his three-year-old  daughter okay so he's texting and the guy goes stop texting and then he goes look i'm texting with my 
[00:36:00]  three-year-old daughter relax and the old guy probably said what he should have said i don't give a  shit who you're texting right does it make it better oh my god no coming said uh the man in  the back row later identified as reeves got up and left the auditorium presumably to get a manager  but he came back after a few minutes without a manager and appearing upset moments later the  argument between the two men resumed and the man in the front row stood up coming said the men started  raising their voices and popcorn was thrown okay authority said reeves took out a gun and olsen's 
[00:36:30]  wife put her hand over over her husband like aunt was saying okay and and then uh and that's when  reeves fired his weapon jam olsen in the hand and her husband in the chest what a nut and the guy's  wife is right with him like oh yeah he's wrecking everybody's life yeah wow this guy should go to  jail for the lease a year there'll be a lawyer a lawyer he'll lawyer up and uh they'll claim a self-defense  say the guy was acting very aggressive toward him he came at him i uh as the popcorn flew i used to his 
[00:37:00]  hand i saw his hand going for something i thought he was going for a weapon it's you know because you  can't prove he actually went and got the gun he may have had the gun already he could have said he  went outside to cool off right he's going to jail for the rest of his life oh he's done his miserable  old life yeah not much left chris rock comes to mind yeah but i understand but i understand you i  understand boy there's nothing worse than having that stress in the movie theater there's a few 
[00:37:30]  very stressful things that happen in a movie theater and that's what i don't like i don't like getting  near a group of people that are yapping because then yet you're just thinking and now is this going  to go through the whole movie and then you see that empty seat in front of you and you stressing  out is you know will chamberlain going to sit in front of me so i can't see but when was the last  time you were in a full movie theater gravity oh right okay i like the general i go off hours 
[00:38:00]  because because of what we do for a living you could go to the the you know the easier shows the imax  you don't have to go on a friday or saturday prime time tiered levels and the sound is so horrendously  loud that it doesn't matter if someone's talking you can't hear them right on i don't know but you  go to regular movie theater it's just it's just nothing but stress the thing that drives me almost  insane i've talked about this over the years between the previews and the movie starting 
[00:38:30]  is everyone working on their snacks you don't like that sound you don't like consuming but the  the packaging you would think for movie theaters they would have figured out the packaging by now  there's no quiet way to open up your little treats no i gotta get to these twizzlers yeah  i got all my milk guns yeah and then there's complete silence and you could hear everyone 
[00:39:00]  eating their popcorn at the same time and termites and i'm right in there eating my popcorn too but i  don't hear i don't hear myself eating the popcorn i hear everyone else eating the popcorn that drives me  insane next time you go to a movie when it gets really quiet right before the movie really try  to take a listen to that sound of everyone eating popcorn at the same time it's annoying and you just  feel you get annoyed at the sound it drives me nuts i start like that that shiver because i'm so like 
[00:39:30]  oh yeah is it the sound of the popcorn like you could hear just the crunch in everyone's mouths at the  same time crunch crunch crunch i i described it i've never heard locusts but it's kind of that  i don't know that's what i yeah i feel what what locust would sound like tearing apart uh everything in 
[00:40:00]  its past oh try it out for yourself next time you really got to focus though because a lot of people  start looking at the screen like oh here's my movie but really listen to the sound in the room  it'll drive you nuts and i got a candy wrapper story that's uh it made me chuckle i was in one  of these artsy fartsy theaters i forgot what movie to be honest with you and i was trying to be like  the guy that i wanted to be really quiet opening up my can i think it was candy and the rapper and  i'm like ah and i'm trying to open this thing and i'm taking forever to try to open it up nicely i swear 
[00:40:30]  this is a true story a lady sitting next to me older lady rips it out of my hand and opens it up  for me really fast and hands it back to me and instead of being really fucking pissed off i'm i was  i was laughing my balls off i'm like that because she's probably looking just like all right open  the button already jesus she got me good and i was not mad about it i i i laughed she liked the fact 
[00:41:00]  that her snatch makes the same sound when you try to open it crinkle crinkle do you ever make a noise  to try to cover it like it's like it's that fucking sound so sometimes i go oh there's a bomb under my  seat yeah the shooter's a retired tampa policeman yeah we figure that much out the captain that guy  snapped yeah what was the young guy being a little uh you know might have been as we used to call uh  beer muscles your muscles thinking victim i'm a young guy in this i'm not gonna let this old guy get the 
[00:41:30]  best of me this old cadger who knows i don't know you can't blame the victim at this point no  of course it's a it's a sad story but we've all been in a movie theater where somebody has pissed  us off to no end it just happens yeah i don't know why because people are just assholes right  they just love making problems no consideration no consideration right you guys want to take a funny

[00:57:30]  it uh you know what i'm just figuring uh they'll they'll notice without me having to say a word but  that don't you think yeah yeah so hard i try not to think much i'm trying so hard but i know you  could ask a question my point is very simple uh-huh oh no what wouldn't they just know how much that  would mean if they would just you know take that out put a small monitor i know they want to supposedly  redo the whole studio i'll believe when i see it but this is something that can be done very quickly 
[00:58:00]  within a day very painlessly it's it's really not much to it what is that shirt eric oh he is so  fucking what doctor hood yes it's doctor who what your phones are working now oh thank you the  worst shirts ever well it's wonderful thanks what does that mean in the iraq is so fully involved  in doctor who now i don't get it i don't know anything about doctor who it's a sci-fi show i know  that much about it it's a sci-fi show yes yes he's got his doctorate so there's what a new movie 
[00:58:30]  coming out no oh what is there they had the movie oh i guess the christmas special and then you  have to wait till september for the new series you like a new series the movie was great you have a  lot of action figures now is that why you cleared out a lot of your old action figures to make room  for this did you have to make a deal with the wife no but it was a small part i just had too much  yeah so i had to start getting rid of a lot of things that i just wasn't interested in anymore 
[00:59:00]  so all that stuff i don't like doctor who i'm not a big doctor who no i wish i was saying it was on  for many years 50 years is it 50 years just had his 50th anniversary what's the whole vibe like like  sum it up as quickly as possible who is doctor who what does he do you don't really know who doctor  who is i mean you know what position he's playing on the field but i mean as far as anything i get  doctor who's on first doctor who's on first hopefully kevorkian's on second 
[00:59:30]  so he's this guy you don't know who he is or where he's from kind of a thing he uh he's an alien  from the planet gallifrey who travels through time and space oh he's really an alien so he's not  even a human not a real doctor is he a doctor he calls himself the doctor all right but he can't  practice it's it's a name he chose yeah all right so and then what does he do time and space doing  what um pretty much just observing but he always winds up interfering in people's personal histories 
[01:00:00]  or civilization civilization's histories like the iraq movie plot yeah gallifrey gallifrey that's not  the name i would not have called him doctor who i don't like that name yeah i have a better name  for him what what dr shit farts i don't think that would award i wouldn't have caught on yeah  oh okay so so he uh goes on a little adventures through time and space and uh and 
[01:00:30]  fucks up people or helps them what does he do it's both is he a good guy or bad guy uh he's both it  depends on the situation this is as vague as his texts he picks up companions and then those go well  for a couple years and then some of them die he's me some of them just leave him and what's he look  like he he keeps changing they're on the 12th doctor now jesus christ every time he dies he regenerates  into another actor into another actor yeah are they all dead the original doctor who guys uh the first 
[01:01:00]  three are dead is there anybody from the first series still on no we're still alive no do we know  any of the doctors 63 wow that was that wacky guy with the big fucking wiry hair yeah yeah william hartner  yeah i wasn't a big fan of his weirdo yeah it started off as a kid show and oh yeah yeah where  he would travel through and show history lessons and stuff but then when he was getting sick they just  came up with oh he's an alien and when he dies he regenerates into another person so they could keep 
[01:01:30]  the story all right and then it just became this whole other thing and now every time that an actor  decides he's going to leave the role uh-huh they kill him off and they turn him into somebody else  are the fans really called whovians some of them called them wait wait but the first one how how  how long was he on before his cancer dictated how the show was going to go entertainment wise uh three  years i think it was a kid show for three years it was it started off as a kid show yeah all right and then 
[01:02:00]  it became this whole big dark science fiction series i've stumbled onto it over the years and  it always looks awful it does look terrible when you realize it's doctor who damn it yeah it does  look terrible it used to look terrible it doesn't now no no the last since 2005 has really come a long  way like do you think it's shot like a movie now oh you think anybody's still making residuals on a doctor  who episode 5 of 1977 like there's somebody who did one line in that movie right right and yeah the 
[01:02:30]  big star yeah well i want to see an old doctor who clip like from 1969 or 1976. this is uh not new  shit new stuff doctor who when iraq was a young doctor who boy oh that was before i was born  doctor who fan have you seen the old ones yeah it's hard to watch some of the old ones  because they don't have a lot of the episodes look at her they're erased i think he's eating like  seems to erase the tapes what is this oh that's that guy that's uh tom baker the fourth doctor i didn't 
[01:03:00]  like him but he's like he was the most popular until david tenen came around the music i have no  idea but he's also been the doctor the longest how long does he do comic cons i think eight years  is he alive he's still alive yeah he was just no he doesn't probably do very well he just did the  the 50th what is that there's a flying thing it's a wow these special effects are amazing

[01:07:30]  realized oh you lean forward you use your skis like a little wing and a lot of these sports they've just  figured out that they're not as exciting if you know what i mean yeah the old days man there was  all these guys were fucking falling all over the place and i don't know yeah the agony of defeat i  was just gonna say i wish that guy had a gopro on that guy oh wow did you see that sam the agony of  defeat on well they've figured out a lot the equipment is perfect yeah yeah they just they just know how to

[01:10:30]  how you doing guys i know you're saying uh will ferrell is overexposed yeah but since he's been doing  those dodge durango commercials as ron burgundy the sales of the durango have gone up 59 is that  true people love will ferrell i thought i love my wife and i didn't believe it but we looked it up  ourselves and found that yeah the sales have gone up 59 i just feel like the ron burgundy character 
[01:11:00]  was overexposed he did everything he was i don't know you're saying that the sales have gone up that  much that's a huge success for the durango i didn't believe it either i wonder if you just listen  more when it's a guy you like like if it's a celebrity and we tune commercials out so much i  wonder when you see a celebrity do people just go oh and then actually pick up the information that  the commercial is trying to give yeah maybe that's it as opposed to him being a great salesman i don't  know i think we're just different i get so sick of those characters on commercials really quickly i 
[01:11:30]  don't fucking hate the flow thing at first was kind of like oh this is a little different and  they just latch on and they don't hate it and they won't let it go let it go yeah now she's in the  shadows what i don't know all right and then you know our pal there time warner cable  they go with a campaign and it's like it catches on right gets people's attention right and then they  don't let it go for years and it becomes just a long time people don't care anymore i don't know 
[01:12:00]  people care about the geico fucking lizard i think we're the idiots it seems like i don't know it  seems like these companies are smart enough to do their research and go well flow's still working so  yeah we gotta use her for at least another year yep i think we're the we're the ones on the outs on  this one originally like kelsey grammar was the geico gecko and he wasn't even the geico gecko he was mad  that guy could that people kept referring to him and mistaking him as geico right he goes i'm a gecko 
[01:12:30]  right and that was the bit right that he wasn't geico right and then all of a sudden it turns into  some gecko that is synonymous with geico employed by guy it doesn't make any sense i hate those can't  stand them you know like the wife always tells me not to do that but i said i might as well do it  and she said what are you supposed to do i don't know that's pretty good they're terrible they're  not funny they're not in i would never use geico because of that yeah telling me what we supposed 
[01:13:00]  to do when when when the window shades come down i don't know got you right up in the clouds you tell  me you're supposed to like find it humorous it's awful it really is yeah yeah the geico gecko stinks  what was the last commercial you really did enjoy hump day was big for geico  ugh what hump day was like the biggest commercial of the year stupid  fucking hump day what's hump day what's hump day play it the camel dance water camel walking through 
[01:13:30]  the office guess what day it is guess what day it is anybody julie hey guess what day it is oh come  on i know you can hear me mike mike mike mike mike what day is it mike leslie guess what today is  i hope he bites you on our fucking neck ronnie how happy are folks who save hundreds of dogs  i hate these two i'd say happier than a camel on wednesday these two jerks with their little 
[01:14:00]  stage that they set up yeah yeah but you know how many people started yelling hump day no no one no one  no one no one no one there's no way that caught on stop it already not that was my favorite commercial  right there the last one which one i laughed at uh the one with that stupid baby crying indian 
[01:14:30]  all right pick up the garbage it's right at your feet oh yeah that was a damn good one a bunch of  litter or something and then someone sees the indian standing there and they just threw out a  a fucking bag of whatever and it flops by moccasins that is pretty fucking yeah people just throw the  garbage at some indian hey you shit face standing there take care of this for me how inconsiderate  what a powerful commercial that really was but engines weren't walking around like that anymore  look he's there he's uh eagle eyes he's got a uh he's an old-school engine in a canoe he's in a 
[01:15:00]  canoe he's on the river we got rid of that type of engine by 1970 see look he's he's in a  canoe right enjoying nature yeah here's america he is america oh yeah yeah yeah all right oh now  i see a garbage in the river oh no oh no pollution pull out it's a where is industrial mess cleveland dump  he's canoeing through yeah fucking awesome smog all righty more garbage in the river

[01:16:00]  think you can make a commercial like that nowadays by the highway right and a car drives by someone  throws it back out the window and it just smashes right they're laughing burger half-eaten burgers  and tomatoes and you know the dialogue would be ah look at that stupid indian look at that dumb indian  did you see i hit him with a bag of garbage turn around let's do it again he thinks it's the 1800s  hey that cigar store thing is crying throw trash at it 
[01:16:30]  throw trash at it  hey you want to find a garbage can jerry why should we there's a fucking indian over there we  can throw our trash at that's the that's the dialogue of that commercial but how powerful  was that like 30 years later i remember it's one of the most yeah yeah  fucking vivid images of television from when i was a kid very memorable there's a uh psa and of course  it's not an american one it might be new zealand and it was um for uh safe driving right was it 
[01:17:00]  called like time stops or time stop safe driving put put that in and it's fucking like it does the job  really does the fucking job two guys uh let me see if somebody knows what it is do they show it on  american tv of course not it's because it's a little too this ain't it no sorry um ah because it's uh

[01:18:30]  progressive like you just associate them with that uh product and so when you're going to buy the product  that name is in your brain somewhere great all right i i guess so here's some more snooze info for  you but for the top 10 brands in the country that are advertised now are actually insurance companies  that goes the biggest and we're second yeah farm and all state and they make it look like they'll  actually take care of you if you need them of course we will full of hey but while you guys are 
[01:19:00]  taking a doodle and everybody else is advertising you might want to talk to the people who who advertise  on your your own station there but the uh fellas ads and all that stuff they're just it's a good  commercial yeah yeah for the most part we got horrendous advertisers yeah for the most part there's a few  exceptions and you know which which ones those are but they stick in the i guess for some reason all  right thank you dave yeah did you find that yeah they just can't figure out they can't figure out real 
[01:19:30]  advertisers for satellite radio i don't know why no because they don't want to give out numbers i think  i don't know why they can't figure it out we should be i bet they can huh i bet they can  then why don't they have them i don't know i bet they hide them what the numbers yeah of course they  hide the numbers we've said it over the years we've been here nine years we have no  fucking idea how many people we talk to yeah no fucking idea what was this fucking bothering me uh let's  say hi to todd in pennsylvania todd how you doing boys hey there is an amazing commercial i think it

[01:46:00]  yeah so it's it's how you make your font yeah let's see your little design all right what it should be  yeah 20 different caricatures one for every year what a busy shirt i'm not a fan of the business  that's a busy shirt so we got that going on which is nice yeah which is nice yeah well the news is  talking about uh jerry seinfeld and jason alexander spotted at tom's restaurant which is in uh morning 
[01:46:30]  heights or whatever the fuck it's called up there oh i didn't get any um tweets about that that's odd  morningside what is it called morningside yeah morningside heights morningside heights yes of course  way to say harlem or the upper west side like it's all right it's okay neighborhood i've been  up that way it's up there i wandered around uh past that tom's diner one day after i gave that guy his  wallet back that i found in the cab and he and he was suspicious that i stole it i'm like oh god i 
[01:47:00]  should have thrown it in the gutter bastard i could retell the whole story but what a  fucking asshole and i just happened to start i go start walking toward broadway and and a little  further i'm like holy fuck tom's diner from seinfeld yeah it's right there that's where it is i don't  remember anymore i want to say uh 90 something no i think it's in the 100s i think 100 something  i don't remember oh maybe like 105 ish 112 or 112 yeah they were uh but they were there what yesterday 
[01:47:30]  and larry david was uh there uh earlier and then jerry seinfeld and jason alexander walked in later  yeah and jason alexander kind of had kind of george wear on right kind of had a like george jacket  and stuff although it wasn't goatex no but they also said there were cables laid out like uh going  into the door and the shades were pulled down real so yeah yeah there were like cables like a video 
[01:48:00]  so they're filming what filming something his hair wasn't on and it's jason alexander's hair wasn't on  i told you i saw jason alexander walking around hovitt square yeah the last time uh jimmy was up  there filming a special and uh no one was bothering him and he did not have his hair on you didn't have  his hair no because it would be a pain in the ass put that on every day probably does it for like uh  the press and this and that functions see there's some crates out there and then the cables that are  running down the sidewalk but the crate says comedians oh so it could be comedians and cars 
[01:48:30]  getting coffee commercial for the super bowl could be a commercial for the super bowl could  be comedians getting cars yeah but i bet it's comedians and cars getting coffee it's like hey  tom's restaurant we've never actually been in this restaurant why don't we go there for coffee  that's what makes it so intriguing because why would they film a commercial for the super bowl  when they never use the interior of the restaurant on the show it was a set i would love it if it's a 
[01:49:00]  comedians and cars getting coffee with george costanza with george not jason george and that's  why larry david's involved right because he has to feed jason the lines yeah because jason can't really  think on his feet because a lot of those stories were written down for him yeah yeah all you have to do  is go to his twitter to learn that yeah you can just read some of his tweets while he sits oh boy  what uh so there's a buzz though i don't know what it's about but something's going on seinfeld  gates is going on yeah yeah oh trying to get to the bottom of it no how's jerry uh dressed because 
[01:49:30]  he has a way to dress for the comedians and cars getting coffee well dresses like a gentleman  in every one of those episodes what does he have what's he got on just regular clothes  there's a lot of sets you have a blazer on yeah for comedians in cars stop saying those words  there's a lot of set dressing  do you think the guy that owns the restaurant said jesus christ can't you 
[01:50:00]  fucking just leave me alone at this point let me run my restaurant you think he's mad you know how  many idiots go there and eat just because it was in seinfeld though even though they never were inside  the place on the show oh sorry of course i did so you're right you don't have to apologize sorry  going to cheers in boston hey i'm gonna go to tom's mom you want me to get you something mom like  maybe i can bring you a roll mom this is in seinfeld mom i went and i went in mom and then i ordered  something to eat mom it looked different than the show mom i didn't realize they don't use the interior 
[01:50:30]  mom i guess you said mom enough yes we should count how many times you said yes remember we did the  cheers thing in boston oh yeah man it doesn't look like the show inside it looks nothing like the  show why would you ever go inside to buy it take the picture outside and move on yeah how's the food  at tom's restaurant yeah it's the diner in in new york city yeah 20 bucks for a burger because it was  on seinfeld yeah i mean there's there's some photos and stuff can you get uh merc merch i don't know 
[01:51:00]  i don't remember this was like 10 years t-shirt yeah more than 10 years ago they have really bad  t-shirts they have really bad t-shirt what it's just the sign right no it's not even that what it's  like it looks like it was printed like an ironed on what's wrong with these guys the worst t-shirt  that would be a big business don't you think oh boy that's terrible right look how bad that t-shirt  oh my god i would wear that the press on it is terrible travis would you wear that no you come on 
[01:51:30]  and i've been handing that to jerry to sign he would just i can he'd be so he'd be so mad at you  yeah he'd probably make a scrunchy face what are you gonna do with this he has this way of looking at  you like he's kind of looking and you're like oh i am a piece of it oh yeah oh yeah i'm bummed i only  have like two more episodes of comedians and cars getting coffee oh don't stop saying those words  exactly in a row it's a lot of words comedians and cars getting coffee 
[01:52:00]  bombs this reminds me of a show i'm going to do anyway he stole my idea what was it it's called um  actors on buses having a mocha his flow is a little better  hey can you play that play the trailer for the next one he's got jay leno the episode will go live  thursday in cars getting coffee oh look at this very nice old porsche for jay

[01:54:30]  uh what is the headline says fetish expert says philly's swiss cheese pervert could be dangerous  they sure got a good picture of him what the someone snapped a picture of him uh without his  pants on in his car looks like rob ford yeah yeah it does look like rob ford he's got a piece of swiss  cheese he's a silly goose the nagel boy dangle he's dangling some swiss over his dick what does it  say uh swiss cheese stinky feet chocolate pudding there's no telling what gets someone's blood 
[01:55:00]  pumping below the belt but one expert says that when a sexual fetish becomes an obsession when it  literally gets exposed to the public as it has for philadelphia's swiss cheese pervert the combo of  fromage and adrenaline can be an unsavory mix they're cheese jokes just won't stop they're cheesy if i  might they're really cheesy grating on me let's go to tape can it go to 
[01:55:30]  the story's a bit blue yeah yeah yeah he's just been driving around holding swiss cheese over his  dick and balls has he masturbated over it and then he yeah then he pulls it up and does he have a big  fucking raging hard on under the swiss cheese all i see is a big star oh he covers his dick with swiss 
[01:56:00]  and then when someone looks in his car he lifts the swiss cheese off what a weirdo to expose his uh  read more of the story please um what's your fetish give us a call oh yeah quote yeah it's pretty weird  but with food who knows it's surprising but it isn't shocking the animated commercial i go look it's us  there was the guy they always every time there's an animation it always looks like opie and anthony 
[01:56:30]  why though i don't know yeah but now they're not going to show it again right no no they'll just show  this guy all right continue on saturday philadelphia magazine published the name and photo of a 41 year  old norristown man who matches the description of a man who's been seen recently holding a slice of swiss  cheese over his penis inside a car around mayfair the man identified by the magazine along with  several of his relatives could not be reached for comment yesterday and his facebook page appeared 
[01:57:00]  to have been deleted oh so they did fine yeah putting cheese all over his prick but that's it that's all  he did um i heard he was masturbating with the cheese the swiss cheese pervert uh is definitely  somebody the cops need to find because he needs more than cheese and a willing partner to feel satisfied  what what does that even mean oh like they're saying he'll rape really well it says he needs more 
[01:57:30]  than cheese and a willing partner to feel satisfied i'm making quite a leap well well we got we got a  guy in philly that's gotta gonna fill in the blanks on this story thank you kevin and philly what do you  got okay i've heard that this guy is no gouda oh my god come on seriously be serious get it get it i love 
[01:58:00]  the get it part no i don't please explain well i wish i knew more cheeses well honestly this guy is  you're not going to find him unless you're extra sharp i had the sharp one when they tried to take his  picture he took a sharp turn to the sharp joke thanks for sharp cheddar i'm running out of cheeses my  cheese knowledge isn't that yeah yeah i'm not very knowledgeable on cheese yeah yeah i like a good

But we'd like to know what our listeners like to have it on their burger as far as cheese goes.  What about a good cheddar?  Cheddar cheeseburger?  Cheddar gets a little greasy on a burger when you melt it.  Yeah.  I just like your basic fucking American cheeseburger.  Goddamn commies.

You were going to say that, but I'm glad you didn't. 
[02:16:30]  All right.  Mm-hmm.  I guess, uh.  Well, that's got to be it.  There's so many more.  Well, the phones are being answered extremely slowly.  Yeah, exactly.  Extremely slowly.  Guy's just fucking moping along in there.  Who for it?  Jimmy, probably.  That was ten minutes ago.  It takes forever to get over here for some reason.  Nah, we've got to fix that.  Holy fuck. 
[02:17:00]  You've got to hook up a fan.  What is that part made of?  I can't smell it.  I'd have to smell it.  It's a little more subtle than usual.  Yeah, it's a nicer bouquet.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  It just drifted over.  You got it, right?  Yeah.  That's pretty bad.  Is it?  Yeah.  Thank you.  It gets worse.  It was subtle. 
[02:17:30]  It got worse.  Right, right.  I thought it was going to be okay.  And then.  Yeah.  Put your nose in the glass and you swirl it around.  And then you really enjoy it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It's got the bouquet.  All right.  Well.  All right.  We're, uh.  Why don't we just go to break?  Yeah.  Well, what?  Well, you know.  Well, you know.  Well, well, well, well, well.  The Parmesan.  Yes.  You don't like that one?  It's terrible.  The hookers call him the Parmesan. 
[02:18:00]  Sorry.  It's terrible.  That's Brian.  Right on.  And now, because they're answering the phones a lot faster, they're just writing cheese jokes.  Right, right.  Now, we don't know what it is.  Right.  Well, we got to just take a couple.  You sure?  Absolutely.  Mike in Albany.  Yeah.  I was going to say, he's not a monster.  He's got a really bad case of blue balls.  Steven in Tennessee.  Jesus, it's over, dude.  Jesus, it's over.  Mike, Georgia. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  I heard his name was Colby Lindberger.  Trash.  Ronnie, North Carolina.  Ron, is this the same Ronnie from yesterday?  Yes, it is.  Hey, we can end with this one, boys.  Hey, these are a lot of bad cheese jokes.  Wow.  Do you know, if you told that joke in a room...  Hey, that was go cheese, man.  I got it.  Go cheese is good.  If you told that joke in a room where there was a good joke, they would combine and explode, 
[02:19:00]  and everything would be sucked into nothingness.  The date is October 11, 1983.  It's 7.18 p.m.  Detective Club Soda with self-professed organized crime soldier, Lyle Chipperson.  Okay, Lyle, you're requesting placement in witness protection.  What kind of information do you have for us?  Yo, I'm in the mafia.  Don't even fuck around with me. 
[02:19:30]  Don't get defensive.  Just explain your business here.  I was in the mafia for years.  My mob name was Lil Chippy D.  Okay, Lyle.  You have no record.  You've been seen with none of our organized crime contacts.  What was your role?  The hitman.  A hitman?  Mafia hitman.  Right, the mafia.  Well, who do you work most closely with?  I ain't no rat.  Then I don't know why you're here.  Are you afraid of repercussions?  Yeah, good luck killing me.  I carry like fucking bazookas. 
[02:20:00]  Lyle, there's no way you could have carried around a weapon like that.  If you're just here to waste my time, I suggest you leave.  Fuck you, cocksucker.  I'd shoot and kill everybody.  Bury in a hole or something.  Then we'll see.  Mr. Chipperson, why are you here?  Fucking stupid cocksucker.  Start listening, you fucking piece of shit.  I can't believe you wasted our fucking time with this bullshit.  Do you know this is a crime?  Make him an offer that no one refuses.  Why don't you do yourself a favor, Lyle?  Walk out the door now. 
[02:20:30]  Fuck you.  You're a funny guy.  Laugh at this.  You like that?  How does this feel?  Fuck this.  The Opie and Anthony Show is back.  I'm serious, XM. 
[02:21:00]  What's this Vine video about with Beyoncé?  Oh, I was cracking up with that fucking thing.  Beyoncé.  But I guess it's funny if it goes over and over again on the Vine.  We just got it once here.  Yeah, it's good once even.  Beyoncé's singing, you know, and she kind of goes toward the crowd.  Right.  And they're just elated that she's singing right near them.  And she turns the mic toward an eager fan who then starts singing into the mic. 
[02:21:30]  And it's haunting.  It's lovely.  Beyoncé.  So she's going.  And then she gives the mic to the girl.  And she just goes.  She's so nervous.  I was watching that over and over again.  Oh, that's wonderful. 
[02:22:00]  She's not good.  But she's panicking ahead of time and saying something to her.  Like, don't pick me, don't pick me.  She's like, I can't, I think she's saying I can't sing.  Or I can't sing, right?  Something, yeah, yeah.  Oh, who's that beast?  That's Precious. 
[02:22:30]  Following along with Ant trolling last night?  I was trolling a little last night.  I had to put Precious.  I love trolling.  What were you trolling last night?  Well, the story had already come out.  Mm-hmm.  That Precious was, like, responding to Twitter haters.  Yeah.  Because people were saying she looked like a beast or whatever.  Uh-huh.  And she said something to the effect of, yeah, that's what I look like on my private jet  flying to the Golden Globes doing my dream job.  Mm-hmm.  She didn't fly on a private jet to the Golden Globes. 
[02:23:00]  So Ant took operations.  Ant took his time to tweet and add to it.  Yeah, yeah.  I forgot what I wrote there.  But this monster is disgusting.  Oh, yeah.  This monster is disgusting.  At least you keep it vague, which is nice.  Or you've got to kind of figure it out yourself.  Her dress and that with that belly, she looks like a full condom.  Oh, God.  It's a big look.  That's great, yeah.  Look at her dress.  Why would she put that on?  Turn this to my way a little, sweetie.  That giant fucking gut. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, she's a big fat lady.  She's fucking lady.  She's an actress.  She's still young, I think.  Oh, Gabby.  What's your name?  Subidu or?  Subidu.  Subidu.  Subidu.  Be nice to her.  She's a lovely lady.  Oh, yes.  She's comfortable with her skin, Anthony.  Okay.  That's a lot of it.  She'll be dead soon, I think.  Oh, wow.  That's not nice.  Why?  She's not healthy.  How do you know?  She's just a happy girl.  That's not healthy. 
[02:24:00]  She can't be.  She looks healthy.  She doesn't look healthy at all.  She looks very healthy.  Extremely healthy.  I don't know.  I bet she gets her leg hacked off first, though, or something.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh.  Maybe you're right.  Wow.  That's what happens.  Hey, is it true that Evander Holyfield once punched a horse?  Yeah, you guys.  I still haven't seen this clip.  I heard about it.  I read about it.  But I didn't bother watching the video.  And where are we at with the Woody Allen thing? 
[02:24:30]  Is Woody Allen responding to those nasty tweets?  I wouldn't think so.  No?  Here's Evander Holyfield.  He's on Big Brother UK.  Oh, God.  Celebrity Big Brother UK.  Where do you put Evander Holyfield as far as fighters go?  He was very good.  I mean, he went up in weight to be a heavyweight.  Right.  And he wound up beating Tyson twice.  Yeah.  I think he was...  But, you know, years and years ago, there was a comedian named Quinton Heggs who works  Dangerfields a lot.  And he boxes.  And years, like, in the mid-early night, he would tell me, if Holyfield and Tyson ever 
[02:25:00]  fight, he said, Holyfield will beat him.  He's got a style that will beat Tyson.  And he just knew that many years ago.  But reading Tyson's book...  Yeah, he was a mess.  God, how frustrating is that?  He didn't...  He wasn't in any real shape to fight Holyfield.  No, not after jail.  With all the cocaine he was doing.  Oh, my God.  I can't...  I can't get over how much cocaine Mike Tyson did.  Right.  And it's all in his book.  It's unbelievable...  It's unbelievable. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  How much coke this guy did.  And I'm at the book...  I'm just about done with the book.  I mean, I was talking to Jimmy about this before the show.  Like, these stories didn't really come out.  I knew he was down on his luck.  You heard that Tyson's probably not doing that great.  But it got to a point where he would go to the grocery store with his now wife, I believe,  and they were counting the items because they weren't sure they could pay for the items.  Here's a guy that, earlier in the book, he walked into a dealership and bought six Rolls Royces for his friends. 
[02:26:00]  And he's like, oh, maybe I got to put back these.  And he said it was embarrassing to go shopping because he didn't want to, like...  But it was a real thing.  And he didn't want to get caught at the cashier going, oh, fuck, we don't have enough money for, you know, the items we got.  He counts items, yeah.  That's what happened to this guy.  And then, well, only a few years ago before he pretty much got clean, he was going out with a hooker.  And she was bringing, like, guys home.  That sounds good.  To make the money.  Yep.  This is Mike Tyson. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  You're not shocked by this?  Nah.  I heard he went a little bad, but I didn't realize to what level.  What he did, like, all that shit just doesn't shock me at that.  Why?  Because he came...  I just remember looking at him and thinking about what a lunatic this guy is.  Right.  So nothing really surprises me.  I didn't know about it.  Like, I wouldn't have been able to guess that he did it.  But nothing that he does shocks me at this point.  Unbelievable. 
[02:27:00]  So.  I'm weak.  I wonder how much money he has now.  Oh, my God.  What?  So I just looked at a picture of a guy.  She's really fat.  Yeah, she's a fucking disgusting mess.  I knew she was big.  I didn't think she was that fat.  She's not supposed to be that big.  You think she's gotten heavier?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck yeah.  She has, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, she looks way bigger.  She's on American Horror Story this season.  She has wrist tangles.  Bigger than I've ever seen her.  She's wrist tangles.  Like, her fucking arms look like fat baby legs.  Yeah, her elbows.  Look around at her elbows.  Yeah, she's worse than I thought she was.  See, that's the problem with when women like her go on like Ellen and go, I don't care 
[02:27:30]  what the critics say.  I look good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that means in your head you're not going to take care of yourself and live a healthy  life.  It's accepted.  Because now you're like, fuck that.  I don't care what they say.  Mm-hmm.  But you should care to a point, no?  You should.  That's, uh...  Because she's getting big.  Yeah.  So here's Evander Holyfield sitting around the Big Brother house in the UK.  Yuck.  And what?  He's, uh...  Yeah, he tells a little story.  Oh, okay.  This was after he had said that he thinks gay people need to be fixed. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, okay.  He was...  Wasn't he religious at once?  He was a very religious guy.  He used to always thank Jesus after his fight, so he's just religious.  I hate it when people fall off their horses.  And then they blame the horse.  It wasn't, yeah.  They're horses.  I fell off my horse, too.  I was so mad because I didn't know my horse was pregnant.  And the horse feet barely missed me when I fell.  Yeah.  Like this.  I'm so mad on the horse because I fell.  I hit him right in the jaw. 
[02:28:30]  That's awful hype people that do that.  Yeah, yeah, I got...  You punched a horse.  Oh, yeah, I punched it.  Of course, of course.  But you're a human.  Oh, that's one word I never would have thought.  You're a human.  Yeah, I know.  I was embarrassed by...  I think that's disgusting.  I think that's disgusting.  By the way, but I'm telling you, I was embarrassed by...  I was embarrassed by what the horse did because the fact that I'm not a good horse rider anyway.  You punched my horse, I would stab you.  Like, seriously.  I want to punch your horse.  Why would I punch your horse? 
[02:29:00]  I would punch your horse.  No, I would.  Oh, boxers.  Holy shit.  Most boxers all just end up sounding the same.  He sounds a little punch drunk.  I was always sounding a little fucking off.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Huh.  Yeah.  He is a little off.  He got in a fight with a horse.  Yes, I did.  Yes, I did.  Let me explain.  Let me explain.  I was embarrassed.  You punched my horse.  Oh, you punched my horse.  Shut up, you proper bitch. 
[02:29:30]  Hey, did you see Kanye's in a little jam, huh?  Oh, yeah.  What did the Kanye do?  Holy shit.  What did the Kanye do?  Well, he was coming to the...  Golden Globes?  Coming to the aid of his woman there, Kim Kardashian.  Yeah.  And, well, you know what?  A racial slur was thrown out.  This guy deserved to get punched in his fucking face, by the way.  Yeah?  Yes.  Yes.  He deserved to be punched in the face.  What happened?  I don't know this.  I don't know this.  This guy was...  Kim Kardashian was going into something. 
[02:30:00]  This guy was, I guess, saying nigger or something or cunt.  But he was saying some racist stuff.  He held the door for her, and a bunch of the paparazzi was outside.  And he turned to her and goes,  Oh, yeah, don't fucking...  Don't sweat all these fucking niggers out here.  And she said, Oh, you shouldn't say that word.  Was he saying it racist or trying to be down?  I think he was trying to be down.  He was saying it about the paparazzi.  Like, Oh, don't sweat these niggers out here or something like that.  And then she said, You shouldn't say that word.  And he turned around and said, Oh, really?  Fuck you.  You fucking... 
[02:30:30]  And then he called her a nigger lover.  So he was going to kill her?  Yeah.  Oh, he was going to kill her too?  Well, that's the allegations at this point.  Of course.  We don't know anything.  But so he went into a chiropractor's office, and then Kanye showed up.  Well, she called Kanye.  Yeah, she called Kanye.  And Kanye shows up, and she told him what happened.  He went into the chiropractor's office where he was in the waiting room, the kid that said that.  And Kanye punched him in the face.  You know, as much as you can't hit people for stuff like that, that should be the social penalty for saying that. 
[02:31:00]  You know what I mean?  Like, that's why I don't need the government to fucking tell me...  The truth of the matter is, for insulting his wife and saying that, that's one thing.  But just for saying the word, I don't see a beating for that.  No, for the way he did it.  But for the way...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  Because then it's using that word in a certain context that's, you know...  Yeah, what a douche.  Yeah, so, yeah, what the fuck.  Is there a video of it?  There's got a video of it.  There's video of some of his behavior with the paparazzi.  Oh, let's use it. 
[02:31:30]  Find you, find you.  Hey, let her.  Hey, let her.  Hey.  You guys, let her go.  Let her go, you guys.  Get back, get back.  Kim, everybody's going to get back.  We're going to stay right here.  We're going to stay right here, Kim.  Oh, vultures.  I'm going to make them.  Don't move.  Don't move.  Hey, let her go.  Let her go, okay?  Let her go.  All the way out, we'll get it.  Jack, let her go.  I am, I'm letting you go.  Let her go.  Sorry, Kim. 
[02:32:00]  I hate the paparazzi and their phoniness.  That's him in the gray t-shirt.  Right.  Nothing's going on.  And that's when he must have said, you know, don't sweat those niggas.  Right, right, right.  And then, whoops.  Whoopsie doodle.  But like the news this morning, driving in.  Yeah.  All they said was that Kanye had punched an 18-year-old for being unhappy with something  he said.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, they don't put it in context because they're idiots both ways. 
[02:32:30]  They should have said what he said.  But you know what?  He's still going to get in trouble.  Oh, yeah.  He's going to get sued.  Regardless of what he said.  You know, you can't fucking punch someone in the face anymore.  Absolutely not.  That'll cost him $150,000, maybe.  Oh, way more.  You think maybe more?  Fuck yeah.  Probably worth it.  Get punched in the face for that.  $150,000 large.  He's got it.  I'd take a punch for $150,000.  That chili smells so good. 
[02:33:00]  A little turkey chili.  Yeah, motherfucker.  Yeah, nigga.  That's what I say.  And then I don't get punched.  Because I just say it.  I use it like I'm talking to the chili.  Yeah, that's chili, nigga.  There's no reason for it.  I know, but you watch a bunch of videos.  Say hit it.  I don't like Worldstar and everything.  Say hit it.  There's no reason there, either.  Yeah, but you're literally just using it to incite people so you can then say, hey, I'm just using it when they get mad.  Well, you gotta be a nigga. 
[02:33:30]  Say hit it.  My hitter, my hitter.  My hitter, my hitter, my hitter, my hitter, my hitter.  That song, by the way, was in my head the entire time we were at the gym.  My hitter, my hitter.  Oh, no.  Not that version.  Not that version.  The other version.  It's a great sounding song.  Yeah.  Yeah, I do like that song.  It's a work of art.  Well, we're gonna go back into the living doll world because there's a fine interview from the UK.  Yeah, this was pretty funny.  Man dressed as living doll, interviewed by a lady that looks like the man dressed as a living doll. 
[02:34:00]  Well, sort of, I guess, right?  Sort of.  They kind of had similar color dress on, and it was a blonde fucking doll face thing.  We've only discovered the living doll phenomenon last week.  I didn't know this was going on.  I thought if you wanted to dress like a chick, you did the makeup thing, and you looked like a fucking horrible man dressed like a woman.  Now it's a whole body suit.  It's a complete plastic or rubber suit that they put on head to toe. 
[02:34:30]  So the face and everything, it looks like a Barbie doll, and they talk, and the mouth doesn't even move.  Yeah, they don't have the mouth figured out.  You would think they would figure out the mouth.  And then you could have, like, a fake vagina and shit that you gotta assume just gets pounded by other weirdos in the living doll get-up.  And then there's a bunghole that you could shove in and then go into the real ass.  So if you want to get tooled in the ass, feel free.  What if you only want to take it in your fake bunghole? 
[02:35:00]  Is that acceptable?  I bet they can make a fake bunghole.  Oh, you mean like...  No, the fake bunghole you said goes into the real bunghole.  Yeah.  But what if you just want to take dick in the fake bunghole?  So you take it in the fake bunghole, and then they just ride it in the crack of your ass?  I guess.  Yeah.  That could work.  What's the protocol on that, Jimmy?  What's the protocol on that?  If you have a fake bunghole, you gotta take it in the real bunghole as well?  I would think if you have a fake bunghole, you're saying you want to get fucked in the bunghole.  Yeah.  If you don't want to get fucked in the bunghole, don't have a bunghole at all. 
[02:35:30]  But why then have a fake bunghole?  To get fucking a bunghole.  But can't you make your bunghole look like it's a female bunghole?  Clean it up a little bit?  No.  There's no way a man can do that.  If I wanted to clean my asshole and just shave it, I have very little hair.  Looking like a bitch?  You have no idea.  You can make it look like a female bunghole?  Looking like a little bitch bunghole?  I have a fucking plump, delicious, kissable bottom. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, God.  And that is a direct quote.  I have a picture.  I'll show you.  Can I have some turkey chili?  No.  It's turkey chili.  How do we get that done?  You're the boss.  You say you want some turkey chili and they get it.  What, you just say it into thin air?  Get it for the boss.  Yeah, Kenny will put the word out.  Yeah?  I think so.  That would be nice.  It's good like that.  It's not good like that.  It smells fucking good.  I've got to have some of that turkey chili.  It is pretty fucking righteous.  Wow, they're still calling about the cheese thing. 
[02:36:30]  Where did Sam go?  We need to push play on that thing.  Oh, right.  It's the, uh, we've never played the fucking video.  I hope there's an open elevator shaft.  He has to fall down.  The UK talk show interviewing the living doll guy.  I don't understand some of this shit.  I don't know.  And then they say it's not gay.  It's not sexual.  It's not.  It's all those things.  It has to be all of the above.  Yeah.  Doesn't it? 
[02:37:00]  It's not even gay.  No, because, like, Ed Wood wasn't gay and he dressed like a.  Yeah, but you're getting the fake bunghole.  That's true.  It's back in that day when you couldn't really say you were gay.  Wait, you dressing up as a living doll isn't gay?  Not necessarily, no.  I think it is.  Is it?  It could be, but not necessarily.  I think it's a type of gay.  Look, we all have to live with ourselves.  You guys say what you say.  I think it's a type of gay, too.  I think it's a type of the gay.  Many types of gay, and I think this is one of those offshoots of where it goes into the  really strange category. 
[02:37:30]  Now, you'd think gay people would get mad at the types of gay.  It's like, no, you get, but there are different types of straight.  Right.  People are straight, and some people just enjoy regular straight sex.  Other people like kinking it up a bit.  So there are different types of the gay, right?  And then you would have gay people say, though, but gay isn't all about sex.  So it's different.  Why, if you were gay, you would dress up as a woman?  Hmm.  Is that what they would ask?  I fucking don't know what they'd ask. 
[02:38:00]  But the person inside is still a man, and you're popping that man's fake bong hole.  Fake woman bong.  Bong.  That goes into the real bong.  If you're not attracted to women, I don't think you'd want to fuck a guy dressed like  a woman.  Right.  Right.  What if you're attracted to guys dressed as women, specifically?  Inner monologue there?  Nope.  No, but you get rid of the penis.  Remember?  The penis sleeve.  We learned about the penis sleeve. 
[02:38:30]  The penis sleeve.  You put your penis away, and then you have a vagina.  Ew.  Dare to dream.  This is really fucking strange.  Wait.  All right.  I am.  So are you gay?  You're a guy.  Right.  Yes.  You get this in the mail, and you put it on.  The M-A-L-E?  Yeah.  And then you go to, like, some shitty hotel where you're having a little get-together.  And then another guy is probably just a guy at that point. 
[02:39:00]  Right.  And he pops you in your fake bunghole.  That's probably gay, because it's a sexual activity.  Not even that, but your fake vagina, let's say.  Yeah, let's go with fake vagina.  Okay.  So there's not even any contact.  But it rubs up against your penis head that's in the penis sleeve.  In the penis sleeve.  Well, this just all sounds very sordid.  Really?  I don't know.  What does that make you?  Lucky. 
[02:39:30]  You got to be in the weirdo category.  That we know.  Oh, that, first of all, you're firmly entrenched in the weirdo category.  But what does that make you, then?  But sexually, I think gay.  I think it's got to make you gay.  You could just be a weirdo.  I think you could, you don't have to be gay or straight.  You could just be weird.  The thought is something.  Dude.  But you're taking penis.  Yep.  But you're dressed as a living doll.  Right.  It has to be in a certain way.  That's what makes you weird.  Yeah.  When you say it like that, it's hot.  I don't know. 
[02:40:00]  All right.  Let's go to the interview from the UK.  LGBTQ.  Weirdo.  Yeah.  With his, as his alter ego, live from Orange County right now.  Good morning, Robert.  Or should we call you Sherry?  Sherry sounds good.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Sherry sounds good.  Could you ever do a real serious interview with someone that's dressed like that? 
[02:40:30]  Dressed like that.  And they take it all seriously.  Like, oh, we want to give you respect, so.  Yes, yes.  Please enlighten us.  What should we call you?  And then they're talking through their face.  Classic.  No.  Talking through their dumb rubber face.  Yeah.  No.  Call me, Sherry.  You sound like somebody I know.  Who?  My coworker.  Who are they?  Hey, look at me.  I'm, I'm Faker McBoobies. 
[02:41:00]  And I'm here to complain that my dinner was cold.  But you, it wasn't and you weren't here.  Yes, it was.  I flew my plane onto your roof and my Faker McBoobies got water on them.  What?  What do you want us to do about it?  Get me a rubber doll.  What's your name?  Faker McBoobies.  Somebody needs to learn. 
[02:41:30]  Trying to hit the music.  There's no one in there.  You picked the worst time you'd do that.  How is there no one in there?  The only way that works is with the...  How is there nobody in there?  Couldn't he go on the brake?  Where's E-Rock?  Travis had to go to pee.  He couldn't go during the brake because he's got to run the brakes.  But what about E-Rock?  Or Sally.  Mm-hmm.  Sally. 
[02:42:00]  All right, let's go to this thing.  So they're going to talk to the living doll lady.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Sherry sounds good.  Okay, listen.  The way I'm dressed now.  Thanks so much for joining us, Robert.  I have to say, I don't know if you can see a picture of us,  but you and Holly, we've got a bit of mirror image going on right now.  You're both wearing exactly the same dress.  What an insult.  I'm trying to be the same dress, Sherry.  It's very strange.  Obviously, berry is the color of the season.  It is indeed.  And Sherry, it's lovely. 
[02:42:30]  Thank you so much for joining us today.  You know, you guys aren't, this isn't a transgender issue  where people feel like they're trapped inside a different body.  A lot of these guys simply do it to have fun  and actually dress up to kind of almost like they're our ideal woman.  Is that right?  You know, it's hard.  Everyone has a different reason that they dress up.  And so it's hard for me to generalize.  I do it because, yes.  It's so weird that they're not doing like a, 
[02:43:00]  she should be doing like a girl voice.  Uh-huh.  Right.  It makes it even weirder.  Aren't you supposed to like work on your girl voice  if you're going to dress like that?  Yeah.  Yes.  This looks like a bank robbery.  Right.  Like, all right, put the money in there.  It's, there's nothing girly about it.  Right.  You got to sound like a girl when you do it.  Mm-hmm.  You have to.  Yeah.  You got to sound like a girl.  Like, I'm, hey, I'm just a girl.  Oh.  I'm Boobie McButtnook.  Boobie McButtnook?  Yeah. 
[02:43:30]  My lips ain't moving and I want my money back.  Money back for what?  Oh, for showing up and there was a hair in my soup.  Where?  I don't even know what you're talking about.  It was a rabbit.  Someone's back from the bathroom.  Travis, he tried to do that about five minutes ago, not knowing you weren't there. 
[02:44:00]  You know, I figure you guys are going to play some living doll videos, so I'll just run to  the bathroom real quick.  Yeah, and jerk off.  I went to the bathroom, Mom.  I had to jerk off, Mom.  Exactly.  I sat down to pee like you taught me, Mom.  I pointed my bad thing into the water, Mom.  My bad thing.  And you told me how your new boyfriend, the moyo, would take care of it, Mom. 
[02:44:30]  All right, let's go back to the living doll.  Robert Sherry has been a master for six years.  A master.  A master tool.  Dumb names.  Has been a weirdo for six years.  Exactly.  It's fucking Halloween.  What are you talking about?  I like looking like a woman.  Kind of blows my hair back, so to speak.  But some people do it because they are transgendered.  They feel that they are a woman or there's a woman inside.  Some of them have this feeling that starts very early in life, and they fight with it, fight 
[02:45:00]  with it, fight with it until they get older.  And I think what happens when you get older, like I think that's what happened with me,  hormones change.  And you change the way you feel about things.  You just give in to it.  A nice plunging neckline for a plastic fucking wrath of con chest.  And then they just showed footage of this thing walking the streets, and no one's taking  this thing seriously. 
[02:45:30]  So is that bothersome to this person or not?  It's like a parade float.  If you saw this walking around, you'd go, oh, that guy's just trying to just be a jerk.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sexual things.  And what if you decide this really turns you on, and you'd have a full make-out session?  You're making out with a mask?  Yeah.  I guess you would do that.  Can you get in that fake mask?  Maybe you could pull the bottom like in Spider-Man. 
[02:46:00]  All right.  Just pull the part of the mask down and kiss them.  Yeah.  While he's hanging upside down.  Yeah.  Except when he's actually hanging right side up because he's fucking got a belt around his  neck because he can't come without fucking feeling like he's being asphyxiated.  Fucking how much stimulation do you need, you fatso?  It's not a fucking hoagie.  It's a fucking woman's plastic outfit.  No lips moving.  Put on lipstick and a fucking wig.  Yeah.  These maskies are idiots.  They look like fucking corpses. 
[02:46:30]  Exactly.  It's ridiculous.  This is the way you feel about things.  You just give in to it.  Is it a sexual thing for you?  No.  He's a lawyer, and he's just a court.  That's a fucking dumb question.  Does your little winky get hard inside of the plastic outfit?  What do you think?  What could it be?  Of course.  No.  I'm a foodie.  There is some of that involved for me, yes. 
[02:47:00]  Just some of the time.  Sometimes I don't even think about it at all.  And sometimes I do think about it.  Involving other people, or is it just something for yourself?  Through your tears.  No, I would never involve other people.  And is that because?  By their choice.  Because for you, Sherry is yours.  She's yours.  You don't want to share her with another man, if you like.  No, I'm straight.  I'm not interested in other men.  No matter how they're dressed.  I'm not attracted to men. 
[02:47:30]  I believe him.  Pause this.  Yeah.  Yeah, because you're in that ridiculous mask, he would say it.  What?  He's sitting straight.  He's not into other men.  And I think there's a weird thing with this.  It's not about wanting another guy.  Oh, so confusing.  But there's this part of this fucking nut that wants to look sexy.  Anthony.  Yeah.  I mean, it's very sexual.  So, to go out and look sexy, who are you looking sexy for?  Men.  He's getting, he wants the attraction, other men, to look at him like he's an attractive 
[02:48:00]  woman.  That right there, whether or not he's going to draw the line between that and fucking  letting some guy hump him is one thing.  There's weird things.  Like, I believe that Ed Wood liked wearing women's clothing.  Transvestites will say this.  A lot of them are not gay.  Some of them are.  But there's something that makes them feel closer to women.  There's something about that that they want.  Because all women aren't fucking into dick.  There's women who are gay and like other women.  But he's turned on by, he's turning on men.  I don't even know if he's turning anybody on. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah, right.  No, he's turning on weirdos that are into that.  I don't think he's turning anyone on.  You're right.  But his actions going out there is to be a sexy woman.  And what sexy women do is attract men.  But you don't think that men are being turned on by this?  Oh, Hannah.  I bet you there are.  There's probably some.  Weirdos.  Not because.  I'm not just saying the average man.  But there's men that are turned on by that look for whatever reason. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  I bet it's not for like, wow, that's a pretty girl.  I bet it's, wow, I love the thought of a rubber fucking woman.  Oh, yeah.  And the fact that she looks dead.  A freak show.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, hold on.  This guy.  Here's a guy.  Here's a guy in Minnesota that wants in.  Jim?  Yeah.  Hey, Jim.  Hey, Jim.  I hear him.  Hey, Jim.  Hi, Jim.  Hey.  Yeah.  Hello? 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  Yes, Jim.  What's up?  What's up?  Hey, it's the guy.  Hey, I'm a master.  Are you a master?  Hey, I'm a master.  I like to wear the suit.  And I like to wear my thighs together.  You're an idiot.  Oh, the chili's here.  Thank you.  Oh, lucky you.  Oh, my God.  I know.  That's going well.  Thank God.  You saved that bit.  By bringing in the chili.  All right.  Back to the interview with the living doll.  Holy shit.  Does it smell good? 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, it does smell good.  Wowee.  No matter how they're dressed, I'm not attracted to men.  Oh.  What happens logistically if you need to eat or if you need to go to the toilet, for example?  Oh.  Or both at the same time.  Exactly.  Do a headstand?  That is the coup de gras.  That's when you have to take it off.  You can go number one in the suit.  There's a mechanism to do that with.  But when you've got to go number two, you've got to take it off.  What sort of mechanism?  That's the maximum time you can stay in the suit. 
[02:50:30]  Like a Play-Doh Fun Factory.  What is the mechanism to do number one?  I'm intrigued.  Put a little mold there for star.  A little star comes out.  You're intrigued?  Well, I just.  Don't you call it number one over there?  No, no, no.  We can get it.  I just wondered how that works.  Is it like a catheter type thing?  There's a.  Yes, there's a catheter thing.  It's very comfortable.  It's very easy to use.  And it's very functional as well.  I understand.  Okay.  So he pisses in that, but he's got something on. 
[02:51:00]  And what does it go to a receptacle or something?  He probably can come out the front a little bit.  You can hold it over a toilet.  Oh, so you sit there and.  And whiz.  Like a chick pissing.  You chicks.  When you piss, it sounds funny as fuck.  I've got to be honest.  That's a really hard one.  Guys get the babbling brook sound and stuff. 
[02:51:30]  We're used to that.  Right.  Man, the first time you hear a chick fucking squat on the ball and take a piss.  That's a little strange.  Turbocharged.  There's an urgency to it.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  I'll be right out.  That's when you know you've got a tight one.  Oh, yeah.  It's like letting air out of a balloon like this. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, it's great.  Why can't they have a zipper in the stupid living doll suit?  Well, that would look weird.  Zip down and.  You've got your little vagina.  Pull out your pecker.  Yeah.  Well, maybe the zipper goes right through the fake vag thing.  I wonder if the fake vag, the sleeve that you put your dick in, is part of the whole  system where you put your dick in there and it's got a little tube that goes through and  out the normal rubber vagina urethra.  Right.  So it almost looks like you're taking a piss.  Oh.  That's got to be a turn off for some of these guys. 
[02:52:30]  Probably would be.  I don't get it.  Then you've got to clean it out.  I don't get that either, man.  It's just not my thing.  I'm a weirdo.  Weirdo.  I'm a weirdo.  I don't get that.  You know what, I don't even get men dressing up as women, so I don't understand.  I don't understand you either.  I don't really get it, man.  Oh, my God.  I got it.  I understand we're supposed to accept that now.  I know.  But that's still very strange to me.  We're supposed to be very accepting these days, Opie.  Very accepting of everything.  But you can't even ask questions because it's... 
[02:53:00]  Don't ask questions because that offends, too.  Right.  Yeah.  You're not even allowed to ask questions.  Just accept it.  Well, can I at least ask questions?  It's a big why.  There's a way to ask that's nice.  There's a guy licking his girl's butthole on my friggin' feed over here.  That's nice.  He's a good guy.  He's just licking her ass.  Can you do that again, fucking creepy beard?  How about you shave before you eat her ass so you don't hurt her?  Wearing his prison clothes.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, go ahead.  That's...  Wow.  Look at that.  He's just tonguing her ass. 
[02:53:30]  Morning breath.  What?  On her big ass?  He has his mouth and her asshole are fighting.  It smells worse.  She's dropping gassers and he has morning breath.  That's a nice little rump, though.  I hope it's his girlfriend, not just a fucking dead body.  Just some dude.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  Well...  Can't see her vagina because she's all shy and shit, hiding under the blanket.  Well...  Hello.  There she is.  Wow, she's very cute.  Whoa.  She's opening her legs.  That's quite a big...  Plump one. 
[02:54:00]  She certainly is.  That's a...  I wouldn't want to lick it now after he was just licking it, but I mean, that's a very nice...  She has nice feet.  Wow.  Really nice toes.  She's very sexy.  Look at that.  Wow.  He's licking her vagina.  We're watching some oral sex going down here in the morning.  He's dressed like every guy that's been beheaded in Iraq.  He's wearing an orange outfit.  He's unshaven.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Wow.  She's hot, man.  That's nice.  Fucking hot girl.  I think she's really high. 
[02:54:30]  I would hope so.  What better time to lick a vagina than when somebody's defenseless and stoned?  That's pretty good.  All right.  Is he going to have sex with her?  I don't know what they do.  Hold on, Opie.  This guy put...  Why don't you suck his penis, miss?  What are you being all selfish for?  What are you being a selfish Susan?  Selfish Susan.  Pull down his fucking orange things while he fluffs it off camera.  It's off camera.  She's big boobs hanging out.  She's fucking lovely.  Tits are hanging out of her little getup that she's wearing. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, I don't know if I can.  Oh, Opie.  Go take a peek a room.  Come on, sir.  Let's get your fucking prick sucked.  What are you doing?  He's trying it hard.  Oh, man.  Look.  She's wearing a little...  He's licking her boobs a little.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  Yeah.  He's wearing a fucking...  Why is he wearing that?  I know.  He's dressed like a Paddington bear.  It's fucking...  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  She's going for his cock.  Ooh.  She's going for the...  For the schlong-a-rooney.  Oh, he's all shy.  What?  Is he shy?  Yeah.  Don't be so shy, sir.  Who cares if it's small?  Oh, boy.  Look at his little...  There she goes.  His wink-a-doodle. 
[02:55:30]  All right.  Look at that.  Look what she's doing on that thing.  Look at that.  She's puffing on it like it's a little cigar.  Hey, look at that.  He's holding her head.  She's going, don't hold my head or I'll talk to the manager.  This is what me and Scott do.  Look at that.  Get your foot out of the way, you dumb fuck.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  She's fucking going up and down, up and down.  Come on, miss.  She's a regular pro right there.  Mix it up, up and down. 
[02:56:00]  Mix it up.  How about a little head flicking?  I want you to lick the balls.  Is it working, sir, or is the pressure on?  I don't know.  How about the pressure's on?  I bet she's got a fucking little piece of linguine in there.  She's holding it, and she's probably doing that trick where the dick won't get hard,  where you just slowly masturbate the soft, babyish penis into your mouth.  Hope we're not killing the vibe for you, sir.  Let us see.  Oh, no.  Oh, he covered it up.  He's shy.  I think there's a problem there.  Yeah, that's true.  He's probably going to the bathroom to put his cock on the counter. 
[02:56:30]  He's going to hit it with a hammer and yell at it for embarrassing him.  God damn it.  He's fucking mad at it.  Fucking cock.  Does he have a fucking opening in the back?  Oh, God.  What is she doing to his ass?  Wait.  He opened up the back end of his...  Oh, God.  She's the best.  She's licking his asshole.  She's eating his ass.  First thing in the morning.  Eating his fucking ass.  Sir, if you have one ounce of moral courage, you'll fucking drop a gasser right now and 
[02:57:00]  end this relationship.  Just give her thumbs up.  Right.  Thumbs up.  And meanwhile, she's vomiting into a bucket over the side of the bed.  I can't believe this guy who looks like Tom Green in orange pajamas just got his ass  eaten.  That was ass licked right there.  What a trooper she is.  Uh-oh.  She's picking something out of her mouth.  Yeah, exactly.  She's fucking...  She's eating certs out of a Pez dispenser.  Wow.  Wow.  What a good couple.  Quite the little couple there on Pell Talk this morning.  Nick Berg.  Where are they from?  Where are you from? 
[02:57:30]  What a good couple.  Type it in.  Feel free.  That was fucking great.  They are from D.C.  Well, I hope you guys come to see me at the improv in there.  Go see Jimmy at the improv.  Yeah, in D.C.  We'll talk about it.  Yeah.  Maybe Jimmy can sit at the foot of the bed and jack off as your wife eats your asshole.  Exactly.  What a nice family moment.  The best part was the unsexy way he did it.  He literally, in his awful orange PJs, got on his hands and knees and just dropped it  and she buried her face. 
[02:58:00]  She knew where to go, right?  Oh, you bet she did.  That was great.  She's going to fucking...  Now she's smoking.  Yeah.  Anything to get the taste out.  She's having a shitterette.  Yeah.  She's fucking smoking a clove cigarette.  He's smoking too.  Neither one of them enjoyed the ass eating.  That's what they do.  They eat each other's asses and then try not to make any eye contact for the rest of the  day.  It's a hell of a morning.  What a great couple.  That was nice.  God bless.  Where they came from.  Very good. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  She's sexy.  She has nice feet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She does.  She's sexy.  She's got nice feet on her.  That's a good thing.  Don't fuck that up, sir.  She's a good girl.  Yeah.  Oh, there they are.  She's showing them now.  Let me see your feet.  Little painted nails.  I've gotten more into feet lately.  Is there anybody else?  Put them near the camera there.  Do you like feet, right?  It's part of the whole package.  I don't have a fetish or anything.  Yeah, they're nice.  Oh, look at that.  Do you suck toes?  I mean, I'll do a little bit of toe sucking.  Oh, yeah.  Those are very nice. 
[02:59:00]  He's right.  Of course.  Well, of course, this guy's honest.  Right on it.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Once a couple eats each other's asses.  Yeah.  Then all the other parts of the body.  Yeah.  He's now licking her toes.  Wow.  She's a punk one.  Her toes.  Look at it.  Yeah.  Her pussy's hanging out of the side of her little thingy she's wearing.  You suck toes, Sam?  I will.  Well, not like as a fetish.  Yeah, me neither.  Yeah, definitely.  Occasionally just you do it.  Now he's making out.  Look, fucking her ass, her toes, now her mouth.  I hope you guys brushed your teeth before this whole fucking John and Yoko sexual extravaganza. 
[02:59:30]  The fucking bed.  Wow.  And it's D.C., so there's no real time difference.  They're just laying in bed at 10 in the morning eating each other's ass.  That's wonderful.  That really is.  Boy, what did you guys do?  You put AM ass eating in the search profile and match.com and you're the only two that  came up?  Christian Mingle.  Christian Mingle.  Wow.  That's so fine.  That's the joke.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, shitter tonguing.  He came up and so did she.  Shitter tonguing. 
[03:00:00]  Well, you know, I like to have my ass eaten, then return the favor and smoke a clove cigarette  and lounge around in bed.  She can't get enough of that cigarette after that episode.  She's actually, it's not even lit, she's eating it.  She's smoking a big Cuban cigar.  Just anything.  Exactly.  Looks like what was popping out of his ass.  Yeah, that's their talk for ass eating.  She's like, feed me a Cuban.  It's not easy to eat this chili right now, by the way. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, right.  I'm just trying to down that chili.  I picked the wrong kind of chili.  Wow.  Yeah, you got yourself a fun one there.  Yeah.  That's pretty decent.  Oh, fuck yeah, man.  I'm not, I'm still not into morning sex.  No?  No.  Why?  I mean at funerals.  Oh, morning.  No, I just never have been.  No?  It's pretty good if you wake up with one of those fucking like rods.  I just want to piss.  Wake up with a rod.  Yeah.  No, I just want to take a leak.  Yeah? 
[03:01:00]  It's always filled with urine.  All right, we're going to take a break and wrap up the show next.  Stay there.  Whoa.  That chili was amazing, yeah.  Isn't that good shit, right?  Holy fuck, yeah.  Aw, yeah.  A nice turkey chili.  You know that Kim Kardashian or something?  Or one of the Kardashians.  Got a Bengal kitten.  Really?  I'm a Hollywood trendsetter, Opie.  I'm the guy they look to to say, what's hip?  What's now? 
[03:01:30]  What's, what'll get me in the public eye?  And apparently a Bengal kitten.  That's where it's done.  You're going to get another one?  That's what I say.  No.  You should get another one.  I'm plenty of company for the little fucker.  Yeah.  Look, see?  Which Kardashian?  Which Kardashian has it?  Kourtney.  Kourtney's got it?  Oh, Kourtney.  A little, uh, a little mingle kitten.  You watch, uh, Keeping Up with the Kardashians?  Not a second of it.  How are you going to keep up, then?  Uh, I guess I'm just going to fall behind with the Kardashians. 
[03:02:00]  Might have to find a blog or two to keep up.  Not even going to care.  I got dentists today again.  Really?  This one is just for the, uh, the dentures.  No, not the dentures.  What do you mean the cleaning?  Don't they start with the cleaning before they figure out everything else?  They did.  But that was already fucking, what, six months ago?  You've been at this for six months just to get falsies?  Dude.  Not falsies.  Dentures.  They're not even dentures.  They are not anything of the sort. 
[03:02:30]  I've had my whole mouth sorted out.  Nice, good choppers in there.  It's so nice to not have, like, a cracked tooth with your fucking tongue getting cut on it every so often.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, and then just like, oh, I can't eat that or drink that because it's fucking cold or hot.  And now it's just, ah, so nice.  I've got to go back to my guy.  There was something.  Now a specialist.  Still hurts.  There was, uh, when I had that wisdom tooth pulled from the back. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  I guess he left a little sliver of tooth in there.  It hurts, huh?  No, I was feeling it for a while.  Right.  I was like, there's something pointy in there.  And then after a while it was wiggling a little.  Right.  Then I just fucking yanked it out.  Whoa.  It was a little, like, fucking dart.  Oof.  I know.  Your body just pushed it out, though?  Yeah, it just pushes that shit out.  Like cum.  Oh.  Why do we have to go to cum?  Your mouth wouldn't have pushed it out.  Would have kept every fucking delicious drawing. 
[03:03:30]  Jesus.  Ah, shit.  I've got to go back, too.  Yeah?  Yeah, but they say there's nothing wrong with my tooth.  Then they're thinking maybe it's a crack.  Uh-oh.  But it hurts, right?  Yeah, it hurts.  Can't they just take a fucking x-ray and say, oh, I see the problem?  I can live with it.  You don't have to live with it.  Thank you.  Why would you just live with it?  At this age and stage of the game, there's enough things that you just have to live with. 
[03:04:00]  Right.  If they can fix it, please fix it.  Of course.  Oh.  The other day after working out my fucking, the inside of my knee just fucking killing me.  And it's still, I fucking still feel it.  But that's something you just go, ah!  Oh, well, I always think back to Louis C.K.'s bit where it's just like the doctor.  Oh, yeah.  You'll have that.  I don't want to just have that.  That's just going to be what it is.  That's it.  Sorry.  I got a bad shoulder with the tendinosis.  Oh!  Jimmy, what do you got?  One step worse than the tendinitis. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  And the rehab didn't work, so.  Tendinosis is worse than tendinitis?  Yep.  More chronic, I guess.  What do they do for that?  Maybe you should smoke some of the chronic.  Yo!  Yo!  Yo!  Yo!  But what do you do for that?  Because I want to still be, you know, a workout guy and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  You can't do anything.  You just go through the pain.  It hurts the fucking lift.  You got to lay off it.  I have laid off it for a bit.  I laid off it for a long time.  It fucking hurts, though.  Do they give you a shot?  Can I do some steroids?  Some cortisone?  What do they do for tendinosis? 
[03:05:00]  Just work through the pain.  Just work right through it.  Oh, dude.  It's not fun.  It's it.  Hooah!  Hooah!  It fucking hurts.  It fucking hurts.  Yeah.  Take an Advil.  Yeah?  Or an Anacin.  Take an Anacin.  Anacin.  Anacin.  Who takes that anymore?  Oh, shit.  Oh, that poor fucking woman.  That 911 call was released from the mall.  You're on their way!  She's like, when?  Apparently they, uh, she called 911 and they were in the parking garage. 
[03:05:30]  Right.  And the ambulance showed up but couldn't fit in underneath the fucking parking garage.  So that wasted time.  They had to fucking get a stretcher and carry it up to where they were at.  To roll it up, yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, uh, it wound up being like a half hour before the year.  I heard 17 minutes.  Really?  No, until they got, I think until they actually got there.  Yeah.  It took 17 minutes just to get to the mall?  I, I, I think so.  It was a long time.  The woman was saying, it's been like a half hour.  Where the fuck are you? 
[03:06:00]  Oh, man.  That's just a horrible story.  Those fucking animals.  Poor savages.  Of course.  Just fucking completely devoid of any value.  No, no, and, and just nothing.  No thought process about, you know, look what we did or, it must be amazing to have that  kind of a, a mind where you just go, yeah, I killed someone but I don't even fucking care.  It doesn't matter.  It must be, it must be a pretty easy way to go through life though.  It must be nice.  Right?  And where are they, uh, they're thinking about, uh, bringing the firing squad for the death penalty?  What state was that?  It's gotta be Utah, right? 
[03:06:30]  No, it wasn't Utah.  No?  They're thinking about, uh, doing the firing squad.  I thought I heard that, yeah.  Texas?  No, it's not Texas.  New York?  New York.  Don't get me started with that shit.  Everyone was so excited when they brought the death penalty to New York or back, whatever.  Pataki, yeah, exactly.  How long ago was that?  And they didn't use it, and they didn't use it once.  And I remember at the time, I'm like, this is all bullshit.  Yeah.  They're just calming everyone down, but now, you know, they'll never actually use it. 
[03:07:00]  Uh-huh.  So why have the, why have it?  Why have it?  It's not a deterrent unless it gets used.  You're trying to tell me since Pataki, there haven't been horrific crimes in this area  that deserve, uh, the death penalty?  Of course.  But they're never going to use it.  So fucking get rid of the fucking thing.  Don't insult us.  Right?  When was the last time they used the firing squad?  I think it was Utah, wasn't it?  With Gary Gilmore.  Gary Gilmore.  Remember good old Gary Gilmore?  And I think his last words were something like, let's do this. 
[03:07:30]  What was his last words?  I'm serious.  Sam, Gary Gilmore's last words.  He had some...  O and A, Sirius XM satellite radio?  O and A party rock, I believe.  O and A party rock?  Yeah, I think that's what it was.  His last words were something like, let's do this, or...  Let's rock!  Something like that.  Did he go pew pew?  What was his last words?  Wyoming, by the way, is the state.  I was going to go Wyoming, but I wasn't ready to commit.  It's just some politician that...  Oh, it's probably never happened.  Yeah, we don't know what...  You can never bring back fun stuff like that. 
[03:08:00]  We don't know what Gary Gilmore's last words were.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  Let's do it!  That's...  It's fucking...  That's a ball.  Marion's catchphrase.  How many Twitter accounts are there for Marion right now?  Oh, there's so many, and they comment constantly.  Oh, what's he rubbing on her vagina?  Is that the magic bullet?  This is...  We're talking about...  Oh, it is.  Matt in Jersey.  Matt.  Hey, what's up?  My girl was actually there the night of the shooting at the mall, and, like, according 
[03:08:30]  to the couple people I've talked to at the mall, I live pretty close.  I miss the homeless shopping spree, unfortunately, but, you know, I live pretty close, and they  said that the security didn't even, like, really notify any of the employees of the shooting.  They let my girl go, like, 20 minutes after the shooting happened.  It's kind of crazy.  Hmm.  I don't understand the point of your phone call.  I think he said no one really did much.  There was no notice given by the mall that there was fucking animals... 
[03:09:00]  In the parking lot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  The stress signal was sent.  Yes.  No ambulance was sent.  I got confused because it says my girlfriend was working at the mall that night.  She said mall security did almost nothing.  But mall security is an arm, so...  Mall security.  Of course they're not going to do anything.  Useless.  Yeah, just notify.  Like, the general notification didn't even get sent.  Like, you know, they just...  Like, the employees were walking out of the mall.  Right.  Like, a couple of employees didn't even know it happened.  Like, and they found out driving home or people were texting them and stuff.  Mm-hmm.  Which is weird. 
[03:09:30]  Like, she texted me, and I already knew because of the news.  Yeah.  She texted him.  He knew.  Right.  Oh, goodness gracious.  All right.  Yeah.  Short hills.  I'm all.  I'm all.  I'm all.  Yeah.  Where's the tall hills?  I'm all.  That was Dr. Chip Waldman.  They're all in one fucking conglomerated, malada, mongrel character. 
[03:10:00]  I say we...  Split.  We pack up.  Yeah.  Get Jimmy's plugs, because a lot of people want to know where Jimmy Norton's going to  be.  You bet.  Let's hope so.  Go see him.  You wouldn't know that by ticket sales.  Next Thursday through Saturday.  Do you know he says that all the time, and then it's like, Jim, how was the gig?  It goes, great.  Sold out.  A lot of people.  It was great.  January 23 through 26, 25.  I'm doing six shows in Atlanta at the Punchline.  And February 6, 7, 8, DC, the Improv. 
[03:10:30]  That's already selling extremely well.  Oh.  February 14th, the Borgata.  I don't know if that's sold out.  The 15th is sold out.  And then February 28th, one show in Pittsburgh at librarymusichall.com.  You can get your tickets.  On my website, there's a ticket link.  Mm-hmm.  So you can just go there and link-a-roo.  Link-a-roo-ny.  Link-a-roo-ny.  All right.  Link-a-roo.  That's fun.  All right.  I'm going to see you at the Borgata. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, I'm happy you're coming.  I don't know where we're going, man.  It's going to be a pisser.  A fucking pisser.  A pisser.  All right, everybody.  The material's very...  I'm happy with it.  We'll be ready to shoot soon, I think.  Yeah.  Again.  Yeah, I want to shoot.  It hasn't even been a year.  You're a machine.  You're a machine.  No, it's just been a lot...  There's a lot of stuff happening fast.  Wow.  Jeez.  Jeez.  What are you going to shoot this time?  I want to shoot in the same place.  Not the same venue, but I want to shoot in Boston again.  Yay.  I love my Boston trips.  I love those crowds, but that venue, they're so dumb, they're never available. 
[03:11:30]  In Somerville, it's just impossible to book in, so do it somewhere else.  There's a million places in Boston.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  See you guys tomorrow.  Later.  The Opie and Anthony show has drawn to a close.  Stay tuned to reflect, relive, and get the story behind the story of the finest moments  of today's show.  Sam Roberts' Opie and Anthony post show begins in moments. </pre>
