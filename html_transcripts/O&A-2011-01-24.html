<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with an extensive review of the AFC Championship game between the New York Jets and the Pittsburgh Steelers. Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton dissected the Jets' loss, focusing on controversial calls, a player wiping his nose on another's jersey, and humorous post-game antics, including a player humping Ben Roethlisberger.  The conversation then shifted to the cold weather, their post-game indulgence in pizza and dessert, and the death of Jack LaLanne.  A caller, Roland, shared his experience switching allegiances from the Jets to the Steelers after the game. The hosts also briefly discussed a History Channel Nazi marathon and Michael Moore's *Bowling for Columbine*.

Next, the show moved on to Keith Olbermann's departure from MSNBC, focusing on his $7 million salary, declining ratings, and the potential influence of Comcast.  They played a clip of Olbermann's final sign-off, which included references to *Network* and his previous ESPN farewell. The hosts voiced their mixed feelings about Olbermann, a combination of dislike and begrudging respect. This segued into a discussion of Regis Philbin's departure from *Live!*, also attributed to a salary dispute, and the surprisingly muted public reaction to both departures.  The hosts debated the entertainment-driven nature of modern news and the perceived bias across various news networks.  A significant portion of this segment was consumed by ongoing technical difficulties with their internet connection, culminating in Opie's successful, albeit simple, fix of a faulty wire connection after months of complaints.  They also reviewed several films, including *The Fighter*, *The King's Speech*, *The Social Network*, *Green Hornet*, *Barney's Version*, and *The Dilemma*, discussing performances and perceived flaws.  They debunked a viral video claiming to show glasses-free 3D technology. Finally, they contrasted Jack LaLanne's longevity with the shorter lifespans of Churchill and Burns.

The show further addressed ongoing technical problems and the neglected state of their studio, described as resembling a hoarder's house.  A major segment focused on Kevin Smith's negative experiences with Bruce Willis during the filming of "Cop Out," detailing Willis's unprofessionalism, including refusing a poster shoot and displaying disregard for Make-A-Wish children on set.  Mark Maron's podcast, featuring Smith's account, was cited as a source. This was followed by a discussion of a reality show about Oprah Winfrey's 25th anniversary, with callers sharing anecdotes about her demanding behavior. The revelation of Oprah's previously unknown half-sister fueled much speculation. The show concluded this section with humorous commentary on Flavor Flav opening a chicken restaurant in a small Iowa town.  A Bill Hicks bit about smoking and mortality was played.

The final segment revisited Flavor Flav's chicken restaurant and the recently closed Times Square Pop-Tart store, replaced by a Burger King "Whopper Bar."  The hosts reacted to a dashcam video of a near-miss with a truck, debated its authenticity, and noted the driver's calm response.  Jimmy, a studio employee, fell out of his chair during this discussion. The conversation circled back to Flav's restaurant, deemed a poor business decision, before transitioning to a pre-recorded power ballad by Anthony, featuring his friend "Foot," who promoted his upcoming Michigan gigs.  A significant portion was dedicated to a 1950s audio recording of a woman undergoing an LSD experiment, detailing her hallucinatory experience. The segment concluded with more of Foot's gig announcements, followed by commentary on a video of Wendy Williams in a bikini.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  Here we go. Here's the bit.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I would love to say we have the best job in America.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  It could be the best thing ever.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  Out loud laughs.  How do we explain the show?  We should start there.  Oh, here it is.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show,  a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment 
[00:00:30]  and having very few limits.  Oh, shit. This is a freak show.  Why would anybody want to come on this show as a guest?  Under the right circumstances, something weird could happen.  I don't give a fuck.  Laugh out loud funny.  Which I love. That's what I love.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  Because when you listen to our show, you know what you get.  You know what we are.  Everything has to do with cock or balls.  No, the jokes all end up talking about cock and balls. 
[00:01:00]  You're a waste of life.  Fucking listeners, go fucking die.  Excuse me.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Wow.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  How many literally Monday morning quarterbacks do we have today? 
[00:01:30]  What are you going to do?  A lot of them.  A lot of them.  I give an ah to the Jets and a ah to seven degrees.  Yeah, yeah.  It is kind of a dual thing.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Cold out.  And, yeah.  Well, the Jets went down.  After the first half, though, I was kind of feeling like, all right, you can resign yourself.  It's a blowout.  Whatever.  They're killing them.  And then they have to add that thing.  That thing.  What's it called?  Hope.  Hope.  They had to add in this hope element where you're like, hey, you know, I think they could come back from this. 
[00:02:00]  I think they could, oh, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Yeah, I would have rather had a blowout.  Yeah, yeah.  My girl, after the game, she's like, oh, you're really bummed about this.  I'm like, well, yeah.  You know, you follow the team the whole season.  Well, at least I have my, oh, that's right.  My Islanders are already out of the playoffs.  I have nothing.  You're pretty done.  I have nothing because I'm not even really a big baseball fan these days. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, catches and pitches start up in a couple of weeks.  I'm done.  What are you going to do?  Maybe I'll follow the Knicks.  They're 500.  That's good.  Ah, so fucking frustrating.  That game was so close in the second half.  Them not getting in on first and goal, four shots was just bad.  I know.  That was a bad one.  They had to punch that in, but I kept screaming, Jimmy hurt me.  I'm like, don't run up the middle.  They got that hole.  Right up the middle.  They got it clogged.  Yeah.  They squeezed everybody.  Go around the side.  You weren't going up that fucking middle.  Left or right. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, they plowed right into every single one of them.  There wasn't even a shot.  They had that middle clogged up.  They're just trying to, hey, can you pick this off pass?  Right.  Oh, that one?  Oh, my God.  I was retarded.  Well, that was a timing pass.  I know.  It was like, you just be there.  You just do it.  I'm just going to rifle the ball.  Yeah.  Well, somebody read his mind on that one.  But the Steelers were basically telling you, we're not allowing you to go up the middle.  You're going to have to go to the sides with this.  And they just kept trying to punch it in.  Yeah. 
[00:03:30]  I'm not a Jets fan, and that was frustrating.  At the one, they just fucking cheesed it.  And, man, if that blocked punt, well, it wasn't a blocked punt, obviously.  That turns into a 15-yard penalty.  He missed that fucking ball by an inch.  And then he got his wrist kicked.  You watch it in the slow motion.  It's like the kicker fucking comes up, kicked his wrist where it looked like his wrist bent into a pretzel.  Any one of us would have had a broken wrist today.  That guy just fucking, you know, shakes it off.  But that's it.  You know, what are you going to do?  Pittsburgh, congratulations. 
[00:04:00]  I honestly think watching go pack go and then watching the Steelers, I got to say the Steelers are probably going to take the whole thing.  I got to go Packers.  You're going to go Pack?  Well, I like to get up.  You're a cheesehead!  I like a good underdog.  I always go for the underdog, hence my sports curse.  That's why I have a sports curse, because I go underdog every time.  Steelers are the better team, but you got to go Packers. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, that was a good hit right there.  They got a lot of calls, too.  I'll say this.  There was a couple of times where the Jets got hit late and they didn't get called.  Fucking Pittsburgh got every fucking call.  What about the Sanchez forward pass play?  That could have went either way.  That was a matter of fucking millimeters.  I swear to you, I'm not bitching.  Congratulations, Steelers.  You move on.  I'm just really frustrated.  Because the Sanchez pass, they could have either said, you know.  Yeah, his arm was moving forward.  Moving forward.  His arm was moving backwards.  But they said it wasn't moving forward, so hence you get the touchdown for the Steelers there. 
[00:05:00]  Sanchez slid head first at one point.  I think an elbow came 40 minutes later, and they didn't get the call.  Right in the helmet.  It's like, how do you not get that fucking call?  They said the play wasn't whistled down yet.  Right to the back of the head.  But still, once the quarterback slides like that, you slide in.  I mean, to lose 24-19 is so fucking frustrating.  And it's like, I don't want to have to start all over again.  This is two years in a row where the Jets have to start all over again. 
[00:05:30]  One game away from the fucking Super Bowl.  Two years in a row.  You know how hard that is to do?  Two years in a row.  Oh, we'll be back next year.  Will ya?  It's really hard to do.  And you've got to, like, go through every game again.  Oh, God.  I'm bummed today.  Are you even going to give a shit about the Super Bowl?  I've got a brand new Sanchez jersey in my drawer.  That is not coming out anytime soon.  That's a collector's item.  No, he's a good quarterback.  No, I know.  I mean, you're not going to be wearing it this year. 
[00:06:00]  I'm happy with the Sanchez.  No.  By the way, we're not even talking about the pick?  The pick!  You saw Sanchez pick his nose, right?  Oh, yeah.  That was a big deal.  Everyone's talking about it.  Everybody was tweeting it.  What the fuck was he thinking?  I don't know.  Did he pick his nose and he said, fuck, I have nowhere to wipe this?  And Mark Burnell goes, just wipe it on me.  Wipe it on me.  I got it.  I got it.  I'll get a tissue and get it off my jersey.  I'm on it.  That was unbelievable.  Why didn't he flick it?  I just flick it.  It was seven degrees.  Four degrees, I think.  No, mine is four degrees. 
[00:06:30]  It's just it.  It's probably frozen.  He could have went ding.  That was stuck to his hand.  He's like, ding.  Probably.  But fucking, he picks his nose.  Yeah, that was something.  And that was the highlight of the first half of the Jets.  That was.  That was their only highlight.  A nose pick by Sanchez was literally the highlight.  That and the fact that they had one yard rushing, which was hysterical.  Yeah, they were getting their ass handed to him.  Oh, my God.  It would have been much easier to wake up with a 48-3 pounding or something.  Yeah, if they would have been able to do anything in the first half. 
[00:07:00]  But they were powerless.  Just to sit there and watch Pittsburgh run the ball like they did.  Like nothing was in front of them.  No, I know.  They could run and get at least three, four yards every single run.  Usually more.  Yeah.  And then the Jets would try.  And it was like brick wall.  Brick wall.  Fucking Steelers were tough.  Especially that first half.  Spectro writes, two years in a row means they're not a Super Bowl team.  Have to make some changes.  I hate when teams make fucking changes.  Because that game could have easily went the Jets' way.  Could have easily. 
[00:07:30]  So don't fuck with anything.  Leave it alone?  Just leave it the fuck alone.  That's the problem a lot of teams do.  Yeah.  Yeah, they switch things up.  Get a little scared.  They go, ah, we got to tweak some things.  Don't tweak anything.  Is this the nose pick?  Oh, it's hilarious.  Yeah.  There it is.  Picks and just wipes it on Brunel.  And Brunel's like, what the fuck are you doing?  We're in the middle of a championship game here.  That's kind of funny.  I think he was just fucking with them.  Probably fucking with them, yeah.  That is funny.  You can't.  And then he does the index finger swipe afterwards. 
[00:08:00]  Did you see the end of the game where Roethlisberger gets humped?  That's another video that's going around today.  That's a good one.  The last play of the game, they got so excited.  You know, Roethlisberger takes a knee.  It's all over the place, that one, too.  And I don't know his name, to be honest with you.  He jumps on his back and gives them three quick pumps.  A little three quick pumps.  So everyone's laughing.  Roethlisberger, when he got that Charlie horse, everybody was going like, yeah! 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, he's down!  No, you knew that was just a stinger, though.  That wasn't an injury.  That hurt.  We've all got a hit to the hip like that.  Not in an NFL game, obviously.  Charlie horse.  Because we would have broken hips if that happened to us.  He took a crazy knee to the thigh.  Yeah, watch this.  This was the last play of the game.  They were talking about this one today, too.  This was the last play of the game?  The hump.  Yeah.  Oh, it's a...  He takes a knee.  Yeah.  And then...  I don't know the guy's name, to be honest.  One.  Yeah, get a better copy.  He's just humping him. 
[00:09:00]  He humps him in the ass three times.  He really is humping him three times in the ass.  What do you think about Jets coach ripped his head set off and said, fuck?  What do you mean?  What do I think?  He's fuming.  That's how he should react.  Chuck, what am I supposed to think?  Oh, I just didn't know if you guys caught that.  And earlier, when they got that 15-yard personal foul penalty, he was bullshitting and motherfucking  it, man.  Oh, yeah.  That's bullshit.  Because that's bullshit.  Because that's what happens in sports. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, it's great.  It's great.  And now they're starting to mic a lot of these people.  I wonder how much trouble they're going to get in.  The humping him like a dog.  Yeah.  We're watching.  All right, bro.  Thank you.  Yeah, I don't care if they're cursing.  I don't care if my son hears the cursing.  Just allow it.  He is humping him.  He humped him three times to end the game.  Why would you do this?  Instead of talking about the big victory, a lot of people are talking about, why the  fuck did he hump Roethlisberger? 
[00:10:00]  He just fucking humped him.  That's funny shit.  Right on his back.  I don't need coaches mic'd, by the way.  It's like, how much fucking noise do we need during a game?  Hey, get to play!  I don't need to hear that shit.  Yeah, Jimmy came over and the amount of sounds coming from my TV.  We were all confused.  I thought my ex-am was on because there's music coming out of one speaker.  There's coaches sound coming out over here and then the games over here. 
[00:10:30]  I'm like, what the fuck are we listening to?  There is some shit going on where you turn your head to the side and you're like, where'd  that come from?  Exactly.  Like, I think someone's in my house.  Yeah, I thought there was a party going on upstairs.  That surround sound shit, it's amazing.  Yeah, I gotta adjust my surround sound.  It's a little off balance.  Surround sound's great and then I was adjusting, you could, I like the TVs these days, you could  adjust them for things like sports and movies and shit like that.  A couple little adjustments, the fucking game looked crazy.  Like you could walk into that screen.  And just fucking beautiful picture. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, they had a really nice picture.  God, they got that HD down and fucking, the settings on your TV, you go with a different  on it.  It just looks fantastic.  I don't know what else we're supposed to talk about with the game.  I mean, it's over.  It's just kind of like when the Jets beat the Pats.  You don't talk about the Pats anymore.  So my team's out.  You don't talk about the Jets anymore.  It is what it is.  It's now the Steelers and the Packers in the Super Bowl.  It's done.  And I tell you what we do talk about, this cold weather that's going to happen. 
[00:11:30]  It's going to be a good Super Bowl though, man.  That's two good teams.  Rodgers is fucking peaking.  Steelers and Green Bay will get like some people watching.  That's definitely.  Some, yeah.  That'll get people watching.  I think the NFL wanted New York, Chicago, two huge markets.  That's just it.  Yeah.  Anytime a New York team is huge.  I think they would have wanted that.  Probably.  Green Bay, Pittsburgh has a historical feel to it though.  They're both just legendary teams.  Yeah, yeah.  That'll do probably pretty well.  Yeah, absolutely.  How many Super Bowls does Green Bay have under their belt?  Dude, you're asking the wrong person, man. 
[00:12:00]  Pittsburgh has six, I think, right?  Yeah, I think they have six, right?  And Dallas also has six, so I got to root for Green Bay.  Let's see.  I think you're about right.  I'm getting a three, three, three.  Three for Green Bay?  Three for Green Bay.  Jets have won 42 years ago.  Yeah, yeah.  42 years ago.  I wasn't even born yet.  Thanks, Jets.  Wait a minute, 10, 20, 30?  Jimmy just shakes his head.  I do have an apology to Jimmy.  Jimmy came over for the game and my girl decided that eating all this cheese and pizza dip and all this crap wasn't enough. 
[00:12:30]  We needed dessert.  Oh, boy.  Jimmy missed the main course.  He came a little later when we kind of packed up everything.  Well, I sent a text.  It was right after the Jets got the first touchdown was scored.  I went to the gym in my building.  I sent a text and it said, hey, if you're not doing anything, me and my girl are showing some vacation slides.  Do you want to come over?  I didn't bring that to the show, but Jimmy's been giving me that text pretty much every game late in the season. 
[00:13:00]  I have nothing else going on.  It's like, hey.  You're not doing anything.  I'm just hanging.  I laughed hard.  I go, come on over, man.  Jimmy's my neighbor, you know?  So he comes over and then my girl's like, I think we need dessert.  I'm like, don't do this.  Because if you go in my house, you will not find dessert because I can't help myself.  That's my problem.  If it's around, I fucking eat it.  So I keep it out of the house. 
[00:13:30]  So she comes back, make a long story short, with, try to remember everything, Jimmy.  Cookies, brownies, French crumb cake, French butter crumb cake.  How was that?  You know what?  After I was bitching on Friday, the French butter crumb cake's not bad.  I had four different ice creams, and Jimmy's like, I haven't had dessert in a month.  And I'm like, I just know how this is going to end.  Yeah.  And sure enough, it ended exactly how it was supposed to end.  Jimmy pretty much ate everything. 
[00:14:00]  I felt a cookie.  I felt, well, I had, I'll tell you what I had.  I felt a Mrs. Fields cookie.  This was after not having dessert for a month.  Right.  And I had a few salsa chips, what's that?  And some salt and vinegar.  I ate a lot of those.  And then I'm like, you know what?  It would be rude not to have a cookie.  It would be.  It was so cold, she went out.  And then she said, do you want some ice cream?  I'm like, of course.  And so I was like, I'm hoping for a little scoop of chocolate mint chip.  Three huge scoops.  Three fucking giant scoops.  What's that?  And chocolate mint chip me, ice cream. 
[00:14:30]  And so I had two pieces of the fucking, of the coffee cake.  The French butter crumb cake.  And then one more cookie to top it off.  It was just a mess.  Probably 2,000 calories.  Probably.  Oh, my God.  I got so much cheese in me.  I'm uncomfortable.  And then the dessert on top.  How many hours?  Yeah, that's what I figured.  How many hours does it take to get this shit out?  I don't know.  Cheese?  18 hours, maybe?  18 hours?  18 hours?  18 hours?  18 hours, I'm figuring.  Really?  Cheese will take a slow journey unless you're lactose intolerant.  I don't feel bad, though.  It's the AFC Championship game.  You eat bad, so what? 
[00:15:00]  Do it again for the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  That's what I look at.  Every couple weeks is fine.  Yeah, but now the Super Bowl doesn't mean as much to me, so.  I know.  I got the.  I'm so fucking bummed out.  I got.  I said today.  I picked up some pizzas.  Nice.  You know, you get some pizzas delivered, and then there was some cake also.  I believe there was a chocolate drizzle crumb cake over the house.  Danny?  That's the chocolate chip.  Crumb cake.  Chocolate chip crumb cake.  And then there was also a marble cake, which was. . .  It must have hurt your teeth. 
[00:15:30]  No, it's not made of marble.  And then there was the cheesy cracker, pepperoni kind of platter thing.  And then. . .  And through all this, Big A brought his little salad again.  He's been doing good.  Big A just had his little salad that he's eating as everybody's pigging out.  Can I tell you how bad I felt?  Because I had no idea that Big A lost like 50 pounds.  Is he up to 50 pounds lost?  50 pounds, yeah, so he brings his own, you know, salad and no fat dressing shit.  Yeah.  So someone's like, oh, yeah, Big A's doing great.  He lost 50 pounds. 
[00:16:00]  Can't you tell?  And I looked, and I was just like, no.  Big A is more 75 to 100 pounds lost.  Then you'll be like, okay.  Realistically, I think it's 100, and then you'll start knowing.  50 pounds, you're kind of like.  But he has to. . .  At this point, he has to eat.  Oh, he knows.  He's either dead.  He has no choice.  He has to eat that fucking salad.  I got to correct myself, and this I find amazing, but it is true.  I'm sorry.  Someone said that the Packers are not the underdogs.  They're favored.  Are they?  What?  A six-seed favored.  And that guy is right. 
[00:16:30]  I remember seeing the odds in Vegas.  Are they really?  You know, the favored and everything.  But the Steelers were 12-4.  Yeah.  And what were the Packers' record?  Look down at that screen.  I don't remember.  I'm looking.  I'm looking.  It'll pop up at some moment.  9-7?  I apologize.  I really thought that the Packers would be underdogs over the Steelers.  There's one thing just saying because of stats and everything like that.  One and 15?  What?  No.  There's a...  There's a...  Yeah, they actually... 
[00:17:00]  The Steelers looked better.  That's all it is.  They just looked better.  Yeah, but Packers are favored.  I apologize for that.  Fuck.  Jesus.  By how much?  How many points?  Do they have the points on the Super Bowl yet?  12-4.  And the Packers were what?  10-6.  Yeah, they were 10-6, and Steelers were 12-4.  Okay.  Sorry about that.  Anyway, back to your party.  You got the crumb cake with the chocolate trissel on top.  I was just saying, you know, poor Big A had to kind of just sit there with his little  salad with all this goodness floating around. 
[00:17:30]  It was very adorable to see him washing his little plastic salad shit in the sink.  I know.  Does he look like he's enjoying his salad?  He looks like he'd enjoy that pizza.  I tell you that much.  Or what kind of dressing is he putting on the salad?  It's some kind of low-fat thing.  Oh, God.  Oh, that's the worst.  He's going for it.  All right.  Good for him, man.  Yeah.  I wish him nothing but the best, because it's do or die, literally, with that guy. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, I know.  I don't feel like fucking talking out of his wake.  I wouldn't even go.  I wouldn't even go.  I probably wouldn't even go.  You know, we're talking about health.  Yeah.  Jack LaLanne died yesterday.  He was 90-fucking-6.  96 exercised his whole life.  That just proves that exercise and eating right doesn't work in the end.  There are some people that smoke and drink and live till that age.  Right, exactly.  He wasted all that time fucking exercising.  You'd think he would have cleared 100.  Yeah.  George Burns cleared a fucking 100, and he was smoking cigars every day of his life. 
[00:18:30]  Hey, you know what?  You make a great point.  You're 100, motherfucker.  He got married when he was 45.  He was married to a woman for 51 years, but he got married when he was 45.  I just saw him on a juicer, mate.  He probably finally had it.  He said, I can't be married to this woman anymore.  He died of pneumonia.  Ammonia.  Pneumonia.  Ammonia.  He died of pneumonia.  Pneumonia.  He died of pneumonia?  Yeah.  Wow.  Respiratory failure due to pneumonia, which I thought maybe means gay.  That's at least a co-word for gay, usually.  Be the AIDS. 
[00:19:00]  No, but...  Jack LaLanne didn't have AIDS.  It's a co-word for AIDS.  Code word.  His wife's name was Elaine.  Elaine LaLanne.  Elaine LaLanne.  Elaine LaLanne.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Well, yeah, he's gone.  Bon voyage.  There's a picture of him.  He always looked like a mess in his little jumpsuit.  I hated his jumpsuit.  But his little fucking...  He'd wear his jumpsuit and do his calisthenics.  Yeah.  He would do...  His exercise regimen never changed from, like, fucking... 
[00:19:30]  And everyone else updates it.  He was still doing calisthenics.  And here we go.  Jumping jacks.  And one.  And two.  And three.  Really, Jack?  1914, he was born.  Wow.  God damn.  Wow.  1914.  He failed, though.  He should have made 100.  He really probably should have made.  He really should have made 100.  It's like his old.  Look at that.  That's classic Jack LaLanne. 
[00:20:00]  With his jet black hair.  Hanging your neck's all kind of craggy looking, you know.  And your eyes, you get all kinds of wrinkles around your eyes.  What's this?  Because the muscles are out of shape.  And you can firm up your stomach by exercise.  You can firm up the muscles in the face.  It's like from the 50s.  Look at this intricate muscular system in the face.  It's like working out your face.  He goes, work your face out.  How do you work out your face?  I don't know.  You got to go, meh, meh, meh, meh.  You make faces. 
[00:20:30]  Does he do that?  Yeah, look.  Now he's making dumb faces.  That doesn't work.  Come on.  I don't know.  You see his pictures?  He's opened up his mouth really wide.  And I was going back and forth like, meh, meh, meh, meh.  And that's working the muscles in the face.  Meh, meh, meh.  Back and forth.  Meh.  Just do this for six hours a day.  Now the eyes.  Now he's going to make big, like, oh, lordy lord eyes.  I made all those faces during the Jets game last night.  Now he's blinking real hard.  Does that work, you think?  I don't know.  I doubt it.  Come on.  It's Jack LaWayne. 
[00:21:00]  What does he know?  It's 1950-something.  What is that?  This guy doesn't know anything.  Come on.  I don't know.  Probably you open your eyes and you'll see, like, sparkly things if you do that.  Dude, he opened his gym in 1936.  His first gym.  1936.  What were they doing then?  Oh, my God.  They had those big medicine balls that they'd throw around and the barbells with the circle,  like the spheres on either side.  And you'd have to lift with a handlebar mustache.  Look at their workout gear, the shorts. 
[00:21:30]  Let me say hi.  Like a camel toe.  Let me say hi to Connecticut.  Connecticut, what's up, buddy?  Hello, Connecticut.  Yeah, hi.  The Packers, five of their games, they lost by a total of 20 points this year.  All right.  So I guess that's why they're favored.  Yeah, they're not as bad as their record showed.  Absolutely.  Yeah, all right.  I didn't follow them that closely this year.  I just, you know, kind of took a peek.  I don't know.  I just take a peek at the NFC.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Yeah, it was also a Nazi-filled weekend, man. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, God.  History Channel decided, you know, let's go back to our roots.  Oh, really?  And just play a bunch of Nazi stuff.  Third Reich, the rise.  And then they had the Third Reich, the fall.  And it was just a bunch of really, like, cool footage that I hadn't seen before.  A lot of home movies from people.  And it was done from the point of, like, everybody.  You know, they had, like, a little girl talking in Poland.  And they had, like, a transcript of what she had written in a little diary. 
[00:22:30]  And they had German soldiers and German upper echelon talking about how this is an amazing thing that's happening in the world.  And then when things started falling apart, they're like, oh, boy, this place sucks.  It was all, like, footage from, like, European families.  Like, it was all private collection stuff.  It was really, really interesting.  And there was a guy, an American, that was there for the Olympics.  And he's there just at the stadium.  And he's taking color video of the stadium and Nazi soldiers walking around. 
[00:23:00]  And they're all smiles and everything.  Just an American tourist.  An American tourist and his wife went to the Olympics in Germany and had a great time.  It was before the war.  So, you know.  But they were commenting on how amazing it was to see so many red flags with swastikas on them.  I'll tell you, whoever had the fucking flag contingency over there, wow.  Made a lot of money.  Contingent. 
[00:23:30]  Now someone's saying that Cowboys do not have six Super Bowls, Jimmy.  They have five.  Oh, is it five?  Okay.  Really?  Because everybody's saying six.  Six for the Steelers, five for the Cowboys, I guess.  Mom.  Yeah.  So, that was a little bit of history there.  The Berlin Olympics.  When was that?  36?  Berlin what?  36, I think.  1936.  So, it was kind of, you know.  That's about right.  So, it was still cool to go over there. 
[00:24:00]  Like, people were like, all right.  Go over there.  He's not too out of hand yet.  Mm-hmm.  That's when Jesse Owens went over there and showed him, right?  Oh, he sure did.  Black guy.  And Hitler was, like, really pissed off.  He's like, what the fuck is a black guy doing?  We're supposed to be the, like, muckety-muck race here.  The other, just before we move on from the football games, the one thing I want to mention  is, those guys are real men that play that fucking game.  You think?  Dude, it was minus four degrees wind chill. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  And they're in short sleeves.  How do you fucking do that?  Seriously.  How the fuck do you do that?  I think, I'm not believing.  They are all men.  And the helmet is cold as shit.  They are all men.  I would never even deny that.  Most of them don't have that scuba diver look that Tom Brady had.  Most of them just go, ah, put the fucking helmet on my head.  I'm good.  Yeah.  Good with short sleeves.  Let's go.  Let's do this thing.  And the ground is just fucking frozen.  How the fuck do they do that without getting frostbite? 
[00:25:00]  They are, um, the sidelines are so heated now, it's crazy.  And, when they're out there, they're moving.  So they're like moving around a lot.  Yeah, but they're out there for a while.  I mean, you know, I mean, if you stood outside right now in a short sleeve shirt on the sidewalk  for two minutes, you'd be crying like a little bitch.  Or you'd be cackled and thrown on the ground by other men.  They are running around.  Yeah.  Nah.  Dude, you can run up and down the sidewalk.  You'd be miserable.  I don't know how they do it. 
[00:25:30]  I really don't.  Oh, no.  It is, uh, that's why they get paid the big bucks.  Do they even notice it's that fucking cold when they're playing?  They don't look like they do.  They don't, right?  It doesn't look like the cold bothers them.  They're superhuman, these people.  I'm just amazed by it.  I wonder if they take any, like, because those guys can play through injuries and shit.  I wonder if they're injected with anything.  Like, is there anything you can take that just makes you a little bit, maybe that's naive.  It makes you a little warmer?  I don't know.  Maybe there's not, but.  I don't know.  Like, is there any kind of supplement you can take that, like, fucking, you know.  But Ant's right, but they heat up the sidelines and they got those benches and warmers and 
[00:26:00]  everything, but most of the time you don't see the guys hanging out in that area.  I went to a Jets game and it wasn't nearly as cold as what they had in Pittsburgh yesterday.  Yeah.  And I noticed the area, what you're talking about, really warm area, the players blow it  off because I think they don't want to be looked at as a pussy sitting on the warm bench.  Well, maybe if they're warm and then go back out into the cold, then it's really fucking  bad.  It's just amazing.  I just don't understand how they fucking do that. 
[00:26:30]  I don't understand.  Yeah, because that was some bitter ass cold.  You see, the white guys are pretty funny to watch because the black guys, you're just  seeing, like, steam come out of their mouth and shit.  And the white guys, you see the steam, but you see their nose is like red fucking, their  cheeks are all red.  Like Rosesbury, when he took that hit to the upper thigh.  Imagine going outside right now, being outside for 20 minutes.  It's like, what, seven degrees right now.  Just have some guy jack his knee into your thigh?  As hard as he can.  You know how bad that would hurt on both levels? 
[00:27:00]  Because you're freezing cold and then the fucking hit?  Literally be crying.  Crying.  I don't get it.  I don't get it, man.  But it is fucking cold.  I guess it's the coldest day of the last few years.  Seven degrees?  Minus one with the wind chill.  I took one of the delivery drivers outside.  Like, those guys are lifesavers.  As much as I hate them sometimes, you fucking can't get a cab.  Because our block's either hit or miss.  Either 500 cabs or nothing.  Yeah.  And they charge you a few dollars more, but it's like you gotta stand outside.  Oh, it's well worth it.  Oh, that's what I say. 
[00:27:30]  Live a little.  Miss temperature.  We live down near the water, too, so the wind and the cold is way worse than the rest  of Manhattan, too.  I just got a little ice cream coming back out now.  Do you?  Yay.  A little fart or burr?  Just a fart.  Just started.  Is it really heinous?  It reminds me I ate ice cream.  Oh, God.  It's gonna be a bad day.  It's not gonna be a good day for anyone else in the room.  I felt bad for Jimmy.  He's like, I haven't eaten dessert in a month.  And then, at one point, he goes, what was the line again?  I wish I filmed him. 
[00:28:00]  Was I eating healthy?  He was bragging about how he's been eating healthy lately, and we all look at him.  My brother was over, the owner of FH Riley's and his wife, and we all turn to Jimmy because  he's talking, and he has so much dessert in front of him as he's trying to tell us that  he's been eating well lately.  I had three scoops of ice cream and I think a piece of crumb cake at that point.  A piece of crumb cake.  A sliver of crumb cake.  And a mouthful of cookie.  And he's trying to tell us he's been eating well lately.  I avoided the brownies.  Fuck, man.  It was good.  Ah, shit.  I've been eating roast turkey and fucking squash. 
[00:28:30]  Squash?  I hate squash.  It's actually, it's grown on me.  I usually hate it.  Fuck, and I hate squash.  Squash is the worst.  I hate squash.  And asparagus, too.  Big boy likes his roast turkey.  Yeah.  Heat it up.  Yeah, but a little mustard.  Turkey's great.  It's healthy, right?  Not the deli turkey, but actual roast turkey.  Turkey's really healthy.  Yeah, yeah, roast turkey's good.  You gotta get that shit moist, though.  Dry turkey sucks.  Yeah, dry turkey sucks.  Sucks a dick.  Oh, mine's good.  No, it's been good.  It's gotta be moist, and you gotta throw a little cranberry sauce on the side, even  though it's not Thanksgiving.  Just a little bit.  Oh, I don't like that cranberry sauce.  And a little mashed potatoes. 
[00:29:00]  That's the way to go.  Now you're talking a whole meal.  I'd just make a sandwich and shove it down my craw.  You stay away from the gravy if you can, if the turkey's moist.  Yeah.  And then you got a nice meal right there.  The asparagus is a little rough with turkey, I'm thinking.  A little rough.  I've been on this kick where I'll just grab what they call your Purdue oven stuff roast  for chicken.  How great are those?  And then I throw it in the oven, like a fag.  I cook.  It takes about an hour.  That's it?  A little more.  You throw it a little more, depending on the size of the chick chick.  How do you cook a chicken, though?  Do you have to put the pan in first? 
[00:29:30]  Oh, 375, 90 minutes.  Let's go.  That's it.  You want to talk chicken?  Let's go.  You slather it with some good stuff, or you put a dry rub on it or something like that.  A dry rub.  It's just like seasonings and stuff.  While it's frozen?  No, not frozen.  You can't put a frozen one in there.  It's in the fridge.  Skin or no skin?  I go skin if I'm going to do it.  You got to.  You got to.  Chicken skin, they say, is the worst thing you could eat.  It's pretty bad.  I love it.  But you know what?  Nice and crispy with those fucking spices on it.  What's better?  A lot of white meat.  What's better?  A lot of white meat, but then you got to take a little of that skin off and just like, 
[00:30:00]  all right, I'll treat myself.  That's the reason I'd eat the whole chicken with the skin and everything.  They should just sell chicken skin all spiced up and ready to go.  Oh, my God.  Who knew that would be so tasty?  It's ridiculous.  When it gets crispy, oh, it's great.  They say, worst thing you could possibly eat.  Yeah, it's bad for you, right?  Oh, my God.  That's why chicken wings are so bad for you.  Ain't no thing but a...  I mean, the butter and all that doesn't help, obviously, but you're eating nothing but  young, fucking chicken skin.  There is something disgusting about a whole chicken, though, that just feels like you're 
[00:30:30]  fucking putting a baby in the oven.  You get this cold, dead baby feeling in your hand.  It's just like...  I'm so glad that I don't know what that feels like.  Obviously, you've held a couple...  Sure.  It's what I imagine, because it's just like the right weight and the size, and it's just  like...  It's just all limp and cold.  Do you know that I was...  Where was I where I saw two rotisserie chickens in the fucking... 
[00:31:00]  And that's exactly...  They look like dead kids, because there's no head.  And they were propped up.  And I'm like, these idiots think they're going for a ride.  I was with Kenny.  I'm like, they think they're on a ride.  They're like, yay.  And they don't realize, oh, we're being roasted.  But they were on a fucking...  And it literally looks like fucking...  They should just have heads on them.  Yes.  That's fucking great.  There you go.  All right.  Hey, I gotta eat.  Let's take a break.  We got our food?  Yeah.  Is it here?  Your food should be here any sec.  I haven't seen my goddamn salmon.  Well, we can play the Drew Boogie thing going into break. 
[00:31:30]  We got some Drew Boogie?  So, congrats to the fucking Steelers fans.  Yeah.  The Packers fans.  Enjoy the next two weeks.  I know I won't be.  Yeah.  Well...  I didn't realize how seriously I take my Jets.  I was really bummed going to bed.  Really bummed.  Yeah.  Last year, it wasn't that bummed, because they were never really in that game.  But last night, it fucking hurt, man.  What did Roland think of the game?  He's outside the studio.  Roland!  It was right at the end.  You just kind of thought, like, can this be one of those where they're going to talk? 
[00:32:00]  Talk about, like, oh my god, the comeback, and then, uh, no.  That was a rough one.  No miracles.  No miracles.  Rough loss.  Roland, you're bummed today.  No, but Steelers right here.  We're number one.  Look at this.  He's wearing a Steelers shirt.  What are you doing?  No, wait a minute.  You had a Jets fucking shirt on Friday.  Didn't you have a Jets shirt on the whole fucking...  Like, I've never seen you wear that Steelers shirt.  I did wear it before, but now...  When?  What?  When?  I wore it years ago.  Well, that's what I mean.  Years ago.  But, but, you've had a Jets shirt on...  Every day. 
[00:32:30]  Up until...  Pretty much every day last week.  Up until the Jets just lost to the Steelers.  Holy shit, you're the worst.  And now you throw a Steelers shirt on?  You're the worst.  I'm like, you guys, you're out to press my team.  Fuck it, boom, I'm happy now.  My team's in.  My team's in.  My team's in.  My team's in.  Dude, he's got a...  Ben Rothenberger, we're going to do it, baby.  He's got a sick logic to what you say.  Never said.  Roland, who doesn't have winter coat, but he got a very light Jets jacket he's been wearing almost every day.  And Jets shirts almost every day.  It's a U2 tour jacket.  What jacket did you wear today? 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, what did you wear today?  No, it's a U2 tour jacket.  How heavy is it?  Um, light.  It's like a...  It's comfy.  Is it like a windbreaker kind of a thing?  Sort of, yeah.  It's barely...  That's what I am today.  It's fucking...  Jimmy's a windbreaker.  Jimmy's a windbreaker, yeah.  It's fucking like three degrees out.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  Hey, but the Steelers, baby.  I can't believe you're just wearing a Steelers shirt.  You have...  You really are.  You're the worst.  Holy shit.  That's it.  But he's in.  He's in now.  His team's in.  He's going to be watching the Super Bowl going,  yeah, Steelers. 
[00:33:30]  Logically, it makes sense.  Not sad.  Not sad.  Chicago was terrible yesterday.  Even though it was a close game,  they looked fucking horrid.  And they were burning Jay Cutler's jersey  in the parking lot.  I didn't see the injury,  but a lot of people saying that  he looked like a little fucking puss boy  not going back into that game.  And then, what?  They were down in their third string quarterback,  and he almost made the monster come back, too.  Doesn't that always seem to happen  when they throw in the fucking...  the guy that hasn't fucking played? 
[00:34:00]  He's really good.  He's not ready for him, either.  Yeah, that's true.  They're not ready for him.  He's a really good quarterback.  He just hasn't played a lot in the NFL.  Bill Sherman?  Bill Sherman, exactly.  Third string quarterback for the Bears.  Does anyone know what happened to Cutler?  Because people were fucking pissed on Twitter.  They're like,  this guy's not going back in the game after that hit?  It's a pretty important game.  It's a really important game.  You get your shit together,  and you get back in there.  Yeah, well...  Did you like the games yesterday, Roland?  Yeah, they were good.  The wings were delicious, where I was at. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, who are you?  Down with my buddy, Kevin,  sticks right through a party thing.  Yeah.  So, I ate delicious wings.  I love wings.  Wings.  But they were baked wings,  so they were healthy.  Hey, Hendry, how about a wing?  Baked wings aren't healthy.  Yeah, they are.  So, that's not 12.  More like a hot in the lungs kind of guy.  Can you look up baked wings  and tell me how healthy they are?  Baked wings?  That's honey mustard, jalapeno wings,  barbecue wings.  Yeah, all that's healthy.  I just piled my plate in deliciousness.  Ooh. 
[00:35:00]  Rooting for your Steelers the whole time?  Oh, I have...  When did you become a Steelers fan?  Tell me.  Yeah, yeah.  Years ago.  Years ago?  Years ago, you became a Steelers fan.  Another baby.  My dad was a big Terry Bradshaw fan.  Is that satisfying enough for everybody?  I know.  I need to have a piece of...  Brad, Terry Bradshaw.  All right, hey, uh...  You going back a ways?  Thanks, Roland.  Thanks for having me.  Fucking Drew Boogie put something together.  Very nice.  Remember your rant on Behave last weekend?  I certainly do.  And you came up with the classic line, 
[00:35:30]  Bowling for Behave?  Yeah, because of Bowling for Columbine.  You had the dummy Michael Moore  talking about Bowling for Columbine.  Right.  And him with his gun stance  saying that everybody that owns a gun  is a racist  and just afraid of an irrational fear  of people of color  and that's why they have guns.  We should talk about that.  I didn't disagree with him,  but...  No, that's what he was saying.  It's like,  fuck you, Michael Moore.  Instead of Bowling for Columbine,  how about Bowling for Behave?  Just Behave, people.  Is that where he went to the place 
[00:36:00]  where Reginald Denny got beaten up  and he made white people look crazy  for not wanting to go there?  Right, right.  That's just such bullshit.  And black people will tell you  that's bullshit.  Calculate it.  Black people will tell you,  don't go where Reginald Denny got hit.  I'm glad you're bringing that up  because he also went there  in the middle of the day.  Yes.  Daytime.  If you want to prove your point,  go at, I don't know,  11 o'clock at night.  With no camera.  Yeah, no camera  and walk around as a white gentleman  in that neighborhood.  What?  First of all,  you'll be lucky  if the cops grab you  and say, 
[00:36:30]  what the fuck are you doing around here  because you're probably  trying to buy drugs.  But if you're not that lucky,  you'll just be jumped  and beaten to a pulp.  He's recognizable enough  where people,  even in the hood,  people,  they know his face.  In the middle of the afternoon  with a camera crew,  he could probably go anywhere  because people know  that something's happening.  They know he's just not  a regular guy.  Right.  But go there with a fucking,  like, you know,  a little hat over your face  or whatever,  or someone where you maybe shave,  you don't have your mustache  or whatever the fuck.  Yeah, yeah.  Go there at 2 o'clock  in the morning  by yourself 
[00:37:00]  with a hidden camera  and see what happens.  See how fun that is.  Is that for 12 wings?  Baked wings.  Well, it's a recipe  I found for,  let's see,  three pounds  makes six servings  and then that's  what it is per serving.  My angel.  So, Roland,  your baked wings  are relatively healthy.  Wait, 600 calories  per serving?  600 calories.  118 milligrams  of cholesterol.  Yeah, but I figure  Roland probably had  at least two servings  of wings.  No, I had at least  over 20 wings.  20 wings.  All right, so 20.  Also, a meatball hero. 
[00:37:30]  Ten pork armless chickens  because of you.  So we had two servings  about.  But the meatball hero  is this big though.  I had three of those.  A little one, yeah.  You did 1,200 calories  in the wings alone easily  and that would be  236 milligrams  of cholesterol  and probably about  46 grams of fat.  He goes,  I walked five blocks  yesterday.  Can I tell you,  I caught something  on the replay last week.  I was, I hadn't listened,  it was when we were  teasing E-Rock  for a bad tape day  and you happened to say, 
[00:38:00]  I didn't catch it live,  you were like,  yeah, you were like  practicing when you were  a kid talking  into a hero sandwich  like it was a mic  and I caught that  in the car.  I just,  I was fucking  with a laugh.  That visual of E-Rock  talking to a hero.  A hero like he's  on the radio.  Nice.  That made me laugh.  Hey, how much  is mint chocolate chip  with that ice cream?  How much is it?  How much is,  I had three regular  sized scoops,  not even giant scoops,  they were actually  average to small scoops.  They were like spoonfuls.  That's more than a serving. 
[00:38:30]  Big table spoonfuls?  Yeah.  Or a little teaspoon?  No, no,  they were mouthfuls.  Good big mouthfuls.  I'm guessing it was  like a thousand calories.  It was vanilla chocolate chip,  I guess.  Yeah.  Whatever it was,  it was the proverbial hit.  By the way,  delicious vanilla chocolate chip.  I would guess,  I'm guessing a thousand calories.  I would guess,  probably a little less.  Amount per serving,  160 per cup.  One half a cup.  One half a cup.  Who eats one half a cup  of ice cream?  The serving sizes  are ridiculous.  No one eats a half 
[00:39:00]  a cup of ice cream.  How much is a cup?  Is that like a scoop?  You had,  I mean,  if it's a half a cup,  you probably had  four servings.  Okay,  so I figure  400.  Because a half a cup  is just not a scoop.  650 calories.  Yeah,  all right,  that's fine.  Plus two Miss Fields cookies,  chocolate chip.  The French butter  fucking pound cake.  French butter pound cake.  Two little pieces of that.  Can't be good.  I didn't have much of that.  Two little pieces  equals one big piece.  Yeah,  I know.  So you can say  I had one big piece.  Our dessert.  For a thin slice. 
[00:39:30]  Our dessert was  12 to 1500 calories  per person easily.  Yeah.  The ice cream  is less than I thought though.  All right,  bowling,  bowling for behave.  We go to break with this.

[00:42:30]  they ain't got no heat i got no heat yo what happened yo my heat's been turned off motherfucker  no it was uh i have this problem uh with uh dual tanks see most people you got that uh one big  tank in the basement i have two of them two of them tandem together and on the bottom there's this  little layer piping with some compression fittings and whatnot linking the tanks together so it it 
[00:43:00]  may equalize the level in each tank gotcha so that as you use it both tanks go down equally how could  there ever be a problem with that that seems like a pretty basic design it's great unless you  fucking didn't use uh big enough tubing when you install the fucking thing oh really yeah and and  this is the third time now that i have to have the guy come out and blow out the fucking pressure  fittings the compression fittings and and the t the little t that's on there because not only does 
[00:43:30]  it equal out the level of the tanks but in the middle is a t that goes off to all the wonderfully  oil everything like that so uh oh my fuck i wake up this morning freezing cold i go downstairs i go  to the tank and the one tank's got a gauge on it and it's just buried at zero and i i i fucking  punch the side of it boom boom i punch the side of the other tank boom boom boom full just one immense 
[00:44:00]  full tank of oil the other one completely empty uh because the fucking uh fitting coming out of the  full tank is is clogged up and uh it was a fucking cold ass motherfucking morning i pride myself on my  radiant heating tile in my bathroom you didn't get that i walked onto that tile it was like a glacier  it was like walking onto a glacier that's the point i made and they're playing football it's 
[00:44:30]  minus four degree uh wind chill and they're playing in short sleeves you can't even walk in your  bathroom with bare feet i was like ah without your heated titles yeah yeah oil yeah it's oil fired for  the floor it's oil and then it heats up the water and hot water circulates through these tubes  underneath the uh cement that god that sounds nice what about a shower no shower then uh there's no hot  water there's no nothing there's nothing of heat uh nothing at all the basement was warm because i 
[00:45:00]  forgot to turn all the lights off so there's 8 000 floodlights uh keeping the basement warm that  ought to be good for a lipo bill when it comes in but um so now i gotta wait and they're like they'll  be there uh sometime between 8 and 11 oh that's not bad like all right i could have been worse but  sometimes yeah i love those uh those times they give you yeah well you know i i still haven't  turned the heat on in my apartment really no you don't do you have your own heat yeah you have like 
[00:45:30]  your own it's not like the building's heat and then you get to like open a vent that technically we  have turned it on a couple times for maybe an hour and then it's like oh my god it's way too  hot in here but you can still get ac in your apartment right i i slept with ac last night  and no heat and no fucking heat damn because everyone else is everyone else is blasting their  heat and i live so high up i'm getting everyone else's heat but it's that dry heat yeah it's a dry  heat where your skin is just like you feel like you i don't know oh you wake up and blow your nose 
[00:46:00]  and it looks like fucking oh yeah it looks like a vietnam wound it looks like a sucking chest wound in  your tissue i'll never just try i'll never be cold in my apartment i mean the heat could go out  and i'll still get enough heat from everybody else i guess i can't get fucking air conditioning in the  winter because we have a single vent system in our makes me out of my mind about it i'm actually  gonna move i mean i can't imagine i can't live like that that's that's just dumb because everyone  knows if you live in new york in a big building a lot of floors and you're a little high up that 
[00:46:30]  you're fucking dying from everyone else's heat you need you actually need ac to cool down your place  yeah i needed to sleep because either i literally was sleeping with my window open  what is 20 degrees yeah i have big heavy drapes in my room so i'll just block them like with with so  they don't like blow all open yeah get a little uh cold air coming in at least yeah so you got one  of those buildings that like the building itself they shut off his ac they at some point in the year  they turn on and it's like hey people you now have air conditioning and then at a certain point it's 
[00:47:00]  like hey people you now have heat right and you don't control the heat of the air conditioning you  just get to open up what amounts to you know a vent and and the heat that comes out you can't  control your own heat well i can control it meaning i can make it high or low yeah but as far as i  explained because i was i was livid and they're like there's two types of systems or whatever  anthony and private know that like one is where you can have like air conditioning and heat together  and one is like a single system where you get one or the other and the way the building works 
[00:47:30]  is if three days in a row or more are under x degrees then it goes to the heating system  yes like under 40 or under 50 i got you it's like i like to fucking sleep that way yeah of course  it's just so it makes me want to not live there that's ridiculous  well this makes up for it you know great that would look all over your keyboard  and have some fucking chicken noodle soup you got a nice hot soup now you're all set  hot soup uh where's the egg whites let's go to john in jersey oh johnny you're shit out of luck 
[00:48:00]  mr norton so well john yo what's up john hey and i want to see uh what you thought about that  douchebag overman getting fired and one other thing i was on uh checking out the weather this  morning on weather.com and they had a video on there of these cool little young sweethearts doing  snow angels and bikinis wait did he get fired though or just walk because of his contract i  don't know if he got fired i think there's a lot more going on with that story than uh than they're 
[00:48:30]  letting out um he he obviously msnbc gets shite numbers they just their numbers stink you compare  them to fox even cnn they are at the bottom of the barrel olberman was one show that was less  shitty as far as ratings go than all their other shows way behind the competition way behind way  behind i mean i'm not an o'reilly fan i'm not an o'reilly fan either by the way who do i hate more  o'reilly or oberman oberman i think i would have to go oberman oberman and i i should agree with 
[00:49:00]  some of his shit and i i just don't like the fucking guy yeah at all he comes across like a  fucking douchebag and i think that i think the story goes he wanted more money right that's what  i think he's telling people and and the the company's like we're not giving you more money  your ratings suck and they do oh he gets a million people he was making seven million a fucking year  he made seven million a year yes yes that oh wow was he overpaid yes dude seven million a year 
[00:49:30]  seven mil and then the rumor is comcast not a rumor that did happen there was a little uh takeover by  comcast of nbc right now that seems to be what a lot of people talking about the main comcast guy's uh  pretty big republican and uh he's tired of this fucking station that's just not making money and  sucks in the ratings so they think that msnbc you might start seeing this little turn a little more 
[00:50:00]  to the right right no uh and oberman had to be the you know poster boy forget the fuck out of here  no uh our old uh producer stunt brain was following this very closely i was reading his  tweets over the weekend and he blogged about it i was reading his tweets too i was i was couldn't  get to sleep and i just i would read him and nod right off it's like it's it's ambient and he said  that uh oberman gave up at least a month ago he was watching oh really and realized that he was like  kind of softballing his show about a month ago because he knew the end was near well he had that 
[00:50:30]  controversy about his uh political donations he was suspended for a couple of days when he came  back he apologized to his fans but never apologized or said anything as far as the channel goes right  uh you know maybe an apology uh don't want to compromise the integrity of the the msnbc whatever  he never said any of that so obviously him and his bosses have been at odds and uh yeah i think it 
[00:51:00]  just came it came down to him wanting more money them saying fuck you and him saying all right i'm  leaving i think you're gonna see him turn up on cnn i think you think cnn will grab him i think cnn  will grab him a lot of the liberal uh news channels which is pretty much all of them except fox uh they  do have this back and forth thing that goes on a lot so well here's oberman from friday night this  came out of nowhere no one saw this coming as far as it happening on friday even the people he works  with i heard yeah i think the same fantasy has popped into the head of everybody in my business 
[00:51:30]  who has ever been told what i've been told that this is going to be the last edition of your show  oh you go direct by the way um and i really don't like this guy but he did make me laugh it's coming up  you know because he talks about how how in broadcasting you just don't get to say goodbye  yeah and you got to hear what he said when he was signing off at espn i kind of liked him when he  was at espn when he wasn't talking all this political shit all right i interrupted but you'll  hear it last edition of your show you go directly to the scene from the movie network complete with 
[00:52:00]  the pajamas and the raincoat and you go off on an existential otherworldly verbal journey of  unutterable profundity and vision you damn the impediments and you insist upon the insurrections  and then you emit peter finch's guttural resonant so and you implore you will the viewer to go to  the window open it stick out his head and yell oh you know the rest that's so true you all want to  do that when you realize it's your last show you just want to have a fucking major scene happen 
[00:52:30]  meltdown moment and you want you want to think your fans are going to be there for you they're going to  rally and fucking burn cars and turn them over and and you realize no you're just just another guy  you're kind of left alone for the most part just another guy for the most part yeah oh  oh you know the rest in the mundane world of television goodbyes reality is laughably uncooperative 
[00:53:00]  when i resigned from espn 13 and a half years ago i was literally given 30 seconds to say goodbye at the  very end of my last edition of sports center as god is my witness in the commercial break just  before the emotional moment the producer got into my earpiece and he said um can you cut it down to 15  seconds so we can get in this tennis result from stuttgart so i'm grateful that i have a little more  time to sign off here regardless this is the last edition of countdown it is just under eight years 
[00:53:30]  since i returned to msnbc i was supposed to fill in for the late jerry knackman for exactly three days  49 days later there was a four-year contract for me to return to this nightly 8 p.m time slot  which i had fled four years earlier the show gradually established its position as anti-establishment  from the stagecraft of mission accomplished to the exaggerated rescue of jessica lynch in iraq  to the death of pat tillman to hurricane katrina to the nexus of politics and terror to the first  special comment the program grew and grew thanks entirely to your support with great rewards for me 
[00:54:00]  and i hope for you too there were many occasions particularly in the last two and a half years  where all that surrounded the show but never the show itself was just too much for me but your  support and loyalty and if i may use the word insistence ultimately required that i keep going  my gratitude to you is boundless and if you think i've done any good here imagine how it looked from  this end as you donated two million dollars to the national association of free clinics and my dying 
[00:54:30]  father watched from his hospital bed transcendentally comforted that his struggles were inspiring such  overwhelming good for people he and i and you would never meet but would always know this may be the  only television program wherein the host was much more in awe of the audience than vice versa  you will always be in my heart for that right this is such he's such a fucking idiot what he he's  always trying to have the that moment where you go ah there's keith there's something else about that 
[00:55:00]  that's it i just hate him i just i shouldn't hate him like his speech he's saying goodbye he's supposed  you're supposed to be eloquent when you're saying goodbye you're not supposed to say peace i'm out of  here i just don't like the guy it makes as much sense you will always be in my heart  for that and for the donations to the kranick family in tennessee and these victims of governmental  heartlessness in arizona to say nothing of every letter and email and tweet and wave and handshake 
[00:55:30]  and online petition time ebbs here and i want to close with one more thurber story it is still friday  so let me thank my gifted staff here and just a few of the many people here who fought with me and for  me eric sorenson phil alangi neil shapiro michael weissman the late david bloom john palmer  alana russo monica novotny my dear friends rachel maddo and bob costas and my greatest protector and  most indefatigable cheerleader the late tim russert so then he read a story do you want the story 
[00:56:00]  what story uh stories stories about aliens the one thing i'll say is they replace him with just a  who gives a shit personality and so it's msnbc gets more blander yeah more blander yeah  so i don't i don't like the guy but at least he you know got got got your blood pumping 
[00:56:30]  now they replace him with uh laurie uh what's her fucking name i don't even remember her name  not rachel maddow no she's not rachel maddow's got her rachel's the big uh rock star they brought in  some other guy no it's gonna be a chick it's gonna be a girl it's gonna be a woman why don't  they have liberals and conservatives on the same station like why doesn't fox have any liberals  why don't the news one just why all we do is accuse them of being biased why don't you just mix up  your your uh pundits that's not the news anymore it's just entertainment right right they turned it into  entertainment but we're a lot of people are slow uh to pick up on that still they think they were 
[00:57:00]  actually watching the news no you're watching you're watching fucking you're watching the news  skewed news for entertainment news entertainment news entertainment what's called what's her name  she they moved her up which it's just gonna be a very bland uh show i uh i could have sworn it was  some guy no man i forgot her fucking name look down someone will help you out there yeah i'm looking  no one knows because no one watches the fuck o'donnell laura uh oh i thought that was a guy 
[00:57:30]  o'donnell laura o'donnell right i thought it was a guy o'donnell i swear i have no clue here's keith  overman reading the story and then we'll find out who's replacing him and now let me finish by turning  again to this ritual of reading thurber stories to you i read these to my late father in the i think  there might be a hidden meaning in the stories about to read oh is there because this is the last thing  he said on msnbc heavy-handed bullshit hospital last winter and then to you at his specific  suggestion it is from fables from our tar for our time and modern poems illustrated published first 
[00:58:00]  in 1940 when they taught those uh uh the they taught these kind of things the aesop's fables  much more than they do now this one is called the scotty who knew too much by james thurber  several summers ago there was a scotty who went to the country for a visit  he decided that all the farm dogs were cowards because they were afraid of a certain animal that  had a white stripe down its back you're a pussycat and i can lick you the scotty said to the farm dog 
[00:58:30]  who lived in the house where the scotty was visiting i can lick the little animal with the  white stripe too show them to me  skunk it's lawrence o'donnell you're right it is lawrence o'donnell okay  i think rosie o'donnell that guy's a bore though man he really is a bore  well it's the perfect guy to replace oldman then 
[00:59:00]  oldman wasn't a bore he just got under your fucking skin and got your blood boiling  i don't even hate him for his opinions i really don't he's just liberal i hate him because he  he was never a bore i'll be honest with you he fucking he's he's supposed to be this big pit bull  and he wouldn't he wouldn't uh he waited for his bosses to fire imus and then he went on and  fucking lapped jesse jackson's asshole i'll always hate him for that yeah absolutely  reverend i put it to you do you pussycat and i can lick you the scotty said to the farm dog who 
[00:59:30]  lived in the house where the scotty was visiting i can lick the little animal with the white stripe too  show him to me don't you want to ask any questions about him said the farm dog no said the scotty  you ask the questions so the farm dog took the scotty into the woods and showed him the white  striped animal and the scotty closed in on him growling and slashing it was all over in a moment  and the scotty lay on his back when he came to the farm dog said what happened he threw vitriol 
[01:00:00]  said the scotty but he never laid a glove on me a few days later the farm dog told the scotty there  was another animal all the farm dogs were afraid of lead me to him said the scotty i can lick anything  that doesn't wear horseshoes don't you want to ask any questions about him said the farm dog no said the  scotty just show me where he hangs out so the farm dog led him to a place in the woods and pointed out  the little animal when he came along a clown said the scotty a pushover and he closed in leading with 
[01:00:30]  his left and exhibiting some mighty fancy footwork in less than a second the scotty was flat on his  back and when he woke up the farm dog was pulling quills out of him oh boy what happened said the  farm dog he pulled a knife on me said the scotty but at least i've learned how you fight up here in  the country and now i'm gonna beat you up so he closed in on the farm dog holding his nose with  one front paw to ward off the vitriol and covering his eyes with the other front paw to keep out the 
[01:01:00]  knives oh boy scotty couldn't see his opponent and he couldn't smell his opponent yeah and he was so  badly beaten they had to be taken back to the city and put in a nursing home moral it is better to ask  some of the questions than to know all the answers scotty who knew too much by james thurber  is he trying to say he's scotty is he the no he should be the shit the skunk fired 
[01:01:30]  that's what he's saying he's the vitriol yeah i'm gunk which one is he is he scotty or the other what  what is he is he the animal with the white stripe i'm confused he's the guy that knows to ask  yeah question because no one else asks questions here's the here's the aesop was a twat and i'm  tired of his fucking fuck aesop i i never liked aesop because how can you because you had to figure  the shit out yourself why don't you tell me what you're trying to say exactly the moral of the story 
[01:02:00]  what two loads are better than one in a girl's face that's the moral of the story i want to read  getting your ass fingered feels great that's the moral of the story make it obvious what are you  trying to say and the scotty got his balls licked and a finger in his ass the moral of the story  wow you come harder with a finger in your ass  aesop was a twat i despise aesop  scotty who knew too much by james thurber james 
[01:02:30]  coming in for rachel maddow on the rachel maddow show is next again all of my greatest thanks  widen the shot out just a little bit so we can do one of these last time leave thank you brian  good night and good luck  what did he do he's too happy to leave so i think he got what he wanted i think he didn't want to be  there anymore well for seven mil figure what the fuck i'll ask for more money and uh so i got 10 mil  they went uh take a hike yeah see you later so well good good riddance i don't ever liked him 
[01:03:00]  not a big reaction to this okay a little bit here a little bit there the day like the not even the day  the moment it happened everyone's like he's not even smart enough to have his last show on a thursday  or a monday everyone in media knows you don't do anything crazy on a friday because no one reads uh  the papers on the weekends or or checks their uh you know their their their their internet as much 
[01:03:30]  on the weekend so you usually try to wait and hit that news on a thursday or a monday a lot of media  companies if there's something really bad going on they will push it and get it out there on a friday  right knowing that you know it it won't be as covered as much any uh any news on the reg and why  he uh yeah regis decided to uh regis is not retiring because he's too old really it was over money  really i said fuck you yeah which is crazy because again i think he's 80 and he fired his agent 
[01:04:00]  wow regis philipan quitting live because of money fight and kelly ripa was stunned by the announcement  she didn't see that one coming yeah it has nothing to do with him wanting to retire he's like fuck you  i deserve more money i'm out of here he's fucking how old he's i think he's 79 80 how much is he  making yeah what what who the fuck's gonna pick him up is someone else gonna pick him up and go  against uh the live regis and whoever the fucking broad is show hell what is he doing uh td bag  commercials not bringing it up money what does he have a gambling problem i don't know what's going 
[01:04:30]  on what is he doing he's not gonna go anywhere else at that age who's gonna pick him up no maybe  they will i guess but i could be as big as joey bishop he's fucking 80 how much more money does  he need yeah no dumb yeah but it wasn't because he wanted to retire it was a money issue he said  fuck you guys some move wow yeah it's fucked up yeah we all know keith overman will be back 
[01:05:00]  that's why people like tweeting all excited i'm stuck and stuff all weekend long i'm like why are you  excited the guy will be we'll be back doing something pretty much uh high profile maybe i'll  do a podcast probably sign here at sirius xm for three days a week for 10 million a year you know i  never even thought of that yeah because he's never really i don't think he's done a lot of radio so  he's perfect for this place perfect a name that hasn't done radio he'll he should get 10 million a  year they'll all be patting each other on the back down the hall you know we just got right 
[01:05:30]  oberman don't say anything we're gonna uh put out a press release we're gonna do a big thing  right right and uh he's gonna be in the building he's gonna be in the building today i got a text  by the way from roland regis got paid 20 million a year and and and he left 20 million isn't good  enough for an 80 year old man what the fuck is he doing i think we all should make more money meaning  everyone listening to this fucking voice right now but still when you hit 80 years old and you're  making 20 million a million a year what's your problem holy shit and he's not particularly doing 
[01:06:00]  anything great he's just palatable and likable he's a friendly old man and he's like a gimmick you  know you got uh you got the old bumbling guy that's what he is right doesn't know much about uh what's  going on today and and and people seem to find that endearing kelly didn't know i guess not  bob kelly bob kelly yeah bob kelly had no idea dude rages dude what are you doing this fucking 
[01:06:30]  internet is enragingly horrible is it bad every day like this what happened it's fucking just  i can't open the drudge report or twitter it fucking stinks  how do they not get the internet right i don't know every fucking day it doesn't matter  they sign howard nothing matters anymore look at the studio it's falling apart in front of our eyes  i can't get on gmail i can't fucking get twitter it just sucks it doesn't matter it just doesn't 
[01:07:00]  matter  jesus i don't yeah i don't know why you gotta you gotta get hardwired in i know i really do  you gotta get hardwired do you have an extra hardwire there's gotta be a fucking router in  here right i got a hard fucking why right here yeah i got a hardwire i'll see you i got fucking i'm  wi-fi and on my ipad right here pretty easily you need to get a fucking cat5 plug it into your 
[01:07:30]  fucking computer and you're good i what i need to get is my fuck the verizon uh the uh portable one  oh you want to get that one i have it but i just didn't bring it with me are you gonna switch  service are you gonna go not yet no because verizon will inevitably have problems with it  it's just the nature of the beast you're gonna have so many people going there  even though they're probably way more ready than piece of shit at&t i still think that at&t might  get a little bit better and they may have a bit of an overload at first but eventually i'm sure i  will i was talking to a couple of my pals over there at the apple store and uh they were they 
[01:08:00]  were asking me am i going to go to verizon over at at&t and i was like no because i've had every  service i mean i've had every fucking service over the years and at&t that i have right now  is no worse or better than any of them that i've had really the verizon even wow for me  personally because i've always had dropped calls fucking bullshit can't get online can't do this  and then it starts working again you just it's fucking they haven't quite got it completely 
[01:08:30]  figured out as far as uh that goes but i don't know i have no problem and then i think at&t is  going to get better because a lot of people are going to jump ship and go to verizon then verizon  is going to have the problems with the overloading of their system i think they're just a better  company and i think they're just more ready for i think they're a better company but i don't know  if it means i'm going to get better service you know i'll see i'll talk to i'll wait until other  people have verizon on their iphone and uh you know see i'm not the scotty that runs in and sticks my 
[01:09:00]  fucking nose up a skunk's asshole i'm asking questions first i'm not going in blind to verizon  so the moral is better to ask questions than have all this than have all the service on your phone  exactly i hate this fucking internet but was keith was keith overman scotty or not he wasn't scotty  no no he was saying that scotty is like everyone else what was he trying to say with that scotty is 
[01:09:30]  all the people the schmucks and dickheads that he's been surrounded by did he ask too many questions  at msnbc or not enough i'm now he's asking too many questions he asked too many questions they  wanted him to be scotty they wanted him to put his fucking hands over his uh eyes what a pompous  and go running in blind what a fucking asshole but uh no no he wouldn't do it  scotty my ass scotty they're they're blaming your computer problems on trinnities uh jimmy 
[01:10:00]  no that's not that would nor is that the website i'm going to now it's working now it's working  but it won't in a minute it'll just freeze up how long have we asked for a router in here and and  just hardwired fucking internet because i don't every day i plug in this fucking computer i don't have  to put in a password i don't have to fuck around i plug it in and it fucking works there should be 
[01:10:30]  a router under this desk with numerous cables coming off of it that anyone sitting at any one  of these stations can plug a computer into and you have internet why that's dangerous and now they  know that it works so well for you they're going to take that oh this wire snipped tomorrow they're  going to take it away that's it yeah it's a fire hazard because nothing's easy anthony's got  internet they don't want anything to be easy around here all right well  jesus christ oh fucking saw the fighter over the weekend oh you did how was that god damn was that 
[01:11:00]  a good movie it was good although i thought uh walberg was a little too hollywood for uh for the  part he played what do you mean it's mark walberg it takes out the movie a little bit christian  bale obviously a big huge fucking hollywood actor but the the movie opens and he's on the couch with  his brother and you had to think twice ago oh my god that's right that's christian bale oh he's  talking with like a american accent yeah he's uh boston lol that motherfucker i don't think christian 
[01:11:30]  bale has used the same accent in any two movies dude he was so fucking good in this movie i can't  imagine him not winning the uh the academy award he was so goddamn good he lost 30 40 pounds for the  roll they they gave him a ball a horrible i'm in my 40s ball spot in the back of his head  he's smoking fucking uh crack really he was how good was he in that movie 
[01:12:00]  oh my god that's what he looked like wow he looks like shit that's the real guy too right is that the  real guy to the right is is that what they're trying to show there are they yes oh my god he looks  exactly like the guy he's the younger version of the other guy by a couple years he has better teeth  but he really looks like that holy shit that's fucking creepy where'd you find that uh just google  image it yeah you just uh christian bale the fighter into google images you can see that side by side  side by side comparison of of christian bale and who he played in the fighter i mean walbury was 
[01:12:30]  definitely good but i i didn't think he was believable he was too like polished to be uh this guy's  brother oh really even though he was supposed to be the you know the good son that didn't  you know wasn't as crazy as his older brother but the movie itself was really fucking good though i  loved it i also loved it a lot i haven't seen true grit yet but the king's speech was really good  was it good it was yeah it was very well acted and true story so yeah i don't i have no desire to see 
[01:13:00]  that none whatsoever none it just seems like it would be dull it was a little slow like it's not  a movie where and i don't need fucking cars flipping over and and exploding i'm just saying it seems like  the story itself here's a king he's got a speech impediment someone's gonna come in and teach him how  to speak properly wow i can't fucking get excited for that who gives a shit he doesn't speak properly 
[01:13:30]  he's a king who cares would you give a fuck fuck for him fucking have your whole life handed to you  who cares it's a shite i wouldn't give a shit he was he was 120 pounds in the machinist yeah i know  that todd thank you i was surprised how good this movie was i was surprised he was uh he was way down  there he was probably he was probably 150 in this movie and then he went from the machinist to batman  so he had where he was all jacked right it's like you guys see the fighter hand it's pretty fucking 
[01:14:00]  good i want to see that one and the sisters in this movie you know that it's a family of seven i guess  two boys and five five girls the sisters are the five ugliest women on the planet right jim  fucking they are so ugly in this movie and then i'm thinking because this is  when you know it's based on a true story you got to think holy shit in real life the sisters are  really ugly how do they feel that they're being portrayed as really ugly human beings right one 
[01:14:30]  had like a uni unibrow oh my god look at the difference that's the same guy yeah a mere year  year and a half apart we're looking at christian bell from the machinist and then obviously in batman  how much did he weigh in the machinist 120 like 120 120 pounds that was this fucking weird ass movie  yeah it was and then he's like it's like he must have just worked out every second of the day for a  year and how is that good on his heart it can't be good it can't be right and other organs your 
[01:15:00]  kidneys right i don't know skinny in the machinist fucking uh i also saw which i liked a lot was uh  social network oh was that good yes love the social network i i just thought they should have  named the movie differently i agree you do yeah it's a weird name it's not really it doesn't and  it's not indicative of anything it was just bizarre right what do you like about the social network i  thought it was well acted um the guy who played zuckerberg was great he really was great i i think 
[01:15:30]  christian bale had a better performance though oh well one would be leading won't be probably uh  it wasn't a lead in that christian bale would be supporting because walberg was a lead  what oh christian bale has it yeah i think fucking down yeah how do you wait it colin firth was uh  is going up for is probably gonna be nominated for best actor how do you not look at christian bale as  as the main guy in that movie now i think i think supporting actor that's how good his uh performance  was that's a weird thing with hollywood like sometimes like those roles it's kind of hard to tell 
[01:16:00]  right but i i think christian blew walberg away acting yeah i agree he wasn't even close but he  he'll be supporting okay jeffrey rush will be support which they should not nominate jeffrey rush he  was decent in uh the king's speech but it was it was who gives a shit the movie guys gives a shit  kent is going to tell aunt why he would like the king's speech all righty thanks this will this will  get racist i guarantee it oh really or it has to have some kind of nazi thing going on okay that's my 
[01:16:30]  guess actually it does it's a period film you know just before world war ii meaning you have  to have your period to watch the fucking thing and that rom-com hold on kent and they're there's  they're selling every movie now as a rom-com remember that used to be a little little side  thing you sort of heard it now they're all in naming the jennifer aniston fucking film a rom-com  uh any jennifer aniston film uh the new uh ashton kutcher film is a rom-com it's a hot word in 
[01:17:00]  hollywood right now rom-com rom-com go ahead kent they're all the same and they're all terrible  go ahead kent but uh yeah i think the reason you'd like it is it's almost if you look at it  the guy is going up against hitler as a leader because it's right before world war ii breaks off  yeah and hitler is this massively empowered speaker like he gets people in up further they  are he certainly did exactly and then you have this stuttering muttering just uh you know he's a 
[01:17:30]  coward can't stand up to his own dad type of guy and it's him having to muster up the courage get  over his own shit and become a good speaker and get his people on the track that they need to be on to  fight the nazis and if you look at the film from that angle it's pretty interesting and he didn't  want to be king um that he was uh but it's good to be his brother left to marry whatever her name 
[01:18:00]  was i don't remember her name american american baltimore yeah um the one who the one who renounced  the throne which was made because king george was the father king george the fifth and then he died  and then the older brother was uh fair enough it just sounds like it could be great it was queen  elizabeth's uh husband this guy and uh the brother renounces the throne to marry the american woman  so now this mumbling stuttering idiot uh who they his brothers all made fun of has to make public 
[01:18:30]  speeches and he would always fucking stammer like a jizz bag on the fucking radio it was it was actually  you know like all right fucking now duke of york now if you go to the movie did you go to the  movie and see that kent no they sent me a copy oh that's that's too bad i need someone that actually  went and saw this in a theater because when he's mumbling and stumbling like an idiot that's you're  allowed to laugh at that but i bet you no one's laughing i bet you no one's laughing in the movie 
[01:19:00]  theater they gotta be come on that's probably part of that's like an about schmidt thing where you  openly laugh because it's hilarious and then of the charm and then the old women will look at you  and go oh dude i can't believe you're fucking laughing at a stutterer i'm saying if you catch  it on the table i don't think you'd be disappointed i mean i wouldn't rush out when you've got you know  some pretty kick-ass movies in the theater right now so what's the best movie out right now uh i  really dug greenhorn it i really really wow that's getting like really strange reviews across the board 
[01:19:30]  because it's not like when you look at your comic book movies now you look at films like watchman you  look at films like the dark knight iron man they're all so serious you know this movie has a lot of fun  with its material it's not afraid to have a character who is a complete screw-up and uh you know it's  homages it needs to to the original series while totally breaking new ground is it it's not too geeky  because i'm not a geek i don't like i mean it's got gunfights it's got christoph waltz from uh 
[01:20:00]  inglorious bastards he's really good in it he is good good actor yeah that guy's fucking fantastic  i didn't see inglorious bastards oh he won the oscar for supporting that and he should have he was a  fucking dude he every scene he's so menacing in and it was such a brilliant performance because  he doesn't try to be menacing it's like see that he's he's he's he's affable is that that way  yeah uh and and personable and likable and just you know he's a pleasant man and you know that 
[01:20:30]  he's just a murderous fucking sociopath really good okay here's the best dialogue in the film by far  and they play up that scary factor he's his character is obsessed with being terrifying in  in the green hornet like if someone says you're not quite as scary as you should be he goes nuts and  he shoots them with a double-barreled desert eagle okay hey all right so i gotta check out the green  i got two really quick questions uh i got scotty pilgrim sitting on my desk do i watch this movie 
[01:21:00]  is it is it a geek movie it is you know it's that video game did you see that uh no it's sitting at  my house too you have no desire to put it in why not really ron bennington loved it he did he loves  that movie well if ronnie b liked it and i'm watching it yeah you gotta watch it it's just a fun movie  like it's got throwback references to old 80s video games and stuff like that and uh great music  it's got a really solid fucking ronnie b doesn't need a speech therapist no he's the best that 
[01:21:30]  motherfucker talks like a king he's the best he's the best and what was your other question  not a question i didn't know how to bring this up to the guys i saw um  paul giamatti's latest film holy shit what a depressing uh flick which one is that i haven't  heard it i uh i forgot the name of it even depressing yeah horribly depressing it's not  going to do well at all it was a very good movie but what's the name of it i'm trying to remember  even what the fucking name i was hoping kent was going to help me out here but he didn't see the 
[01:22:00]  movie no i've heard it's like like his last few projects have been really hard ever since he did  lady in the water though oh here comes roland because he was the one who gave me this movie  to watch and i was like why am i watching this it's so fucking depressing i love a good depressing  movie i don't hate them yeah get on mic barney's version it's it's called barney's version oh  give me roll could you explain barney's version to anthony and jimmy um we're talking movies right 
[01:22:30]  now a little movie break for everybody very well acted with the dustin hoffman just depressing though  yeah dustin hoffman's in it yeah is it can i have a copy of it no i think i got mine still i'll bring  i have one do you want to yeah i get screener copies of a lot that's one of those movies like  why am i watching this i want to i i don't want to be fucking all weirded out i'll watch it today if  you get it sad i know it's too sad and then giamatti starts losing his mind in this movie he's like 
[01:23:00]  oh my god he doesn't remember the people who love him and his marriage is too fuck his marriage  breaks up because he had one little fling and and and he he meets the the woman of his dreams at his  own wedding oh shit it doesn't even get my heart so then you think he's a just a fucking jewish pig  and it turns out he's not he finally he found his soulmate actually at his wedding that's fucking  this doesn't sound well acted though man hoffman was great in it he was great in it and so was 
[01:23:30]  obviously take a ride through the life and memories of barney panofsky a hard-drinking cigar-smoking  foul-mouthed 65-year-old hockey fanatic and television producer as he reflects on his life's  successes and numerous numerous gaffes and failures as the final chapters of his own existence  come sharply into focus would you see that no i know you would it just doesn't sound like anything  i'm interested but it wasn't a rom-com a rom-com but the king speech is awesome though yeah people 
[01:24:00]  saw that in theaters ken thank you it was calling for it was very good i have one quick thing i want  to tell you guys about or get your opinion on yeah it's this uh new technology they put out for  being able to see 3d without glasses where they put these little electrodes on the side of your head  that blink your eyelids at the correct rate so you see 3d that's awful what do you mean blinks your  eyelids that's fucked up anthony you know how shutter glasses work where yeah each side opens and closes 
[01:24:30]  really rapidly so you alternately you're seeing right alternately they have these two little  electrodes they stick on the side of your head that alternately blink your eyelids at the same frame  rate not literally blinking your eyelids like an electric blinking an electrical charge into your  fucking eyelid muscles what if you see a movie what if you get up and you gotta take a leak or go to  the fucking kitchen and get some food this movie's great nothing they would ever put in theaters but 
[01:25:00]  they're talking about putting it in ces next year having a demonstration up in this they can't allow  wow this technology no that fucks with your body too much it's insane i want you guys to see go to  tiny url tiny url.com slash 3d no glasses 3d no glasses that's insane that really video of the guy's  eyelids just fluttering it's like nazi nazi stuff that that's like clockwork orange yes clockwork orange 
[01:25:30]  what are they gonna just fucking um keep your eyelids open so you can see fucking something what would  it be me gulliver all right by the way you know your kid loved the clockwork orange voices that's i had  a little tiger a little i bought his his son a little tiger and i just kept doing clockwork lines  hello but my head won't allow it and uh hello frank and all that and the fucking kid was all smiled  my son was uh he really enjoyed the clockwork my son was fascinated by jim norton he's a good boy  he was fascinated and the kid almost broke his nose on uh saturday night look at this video of the 
[01:26:00]  fucking eyelids blinking all right this is crazy they can't allow this this can't be real isn't  that terrifying of course it is it looks awful who the fuck needs our eyes manipulated put the  glasses on that would fucking i hate having to wear glasses over my glasses that's not real we gotta  try this though it's not real you think there's just a goof yeah it's to go send sam to ces next  year the guy swears he's gonna have one there dude this is a goof this is fake oh this is the video 
[01:26:30]  we're watching this guy came up with the technology uh the french guy who put it on  is demonstrating it and another guy that's not a goofy he's really making his eye you can't make  your eyes move like that unless you got some kind of electrodes on the side of your head i'm seeing  some kind of fucking uh trickery here there's no there's no fucking way they would allow that  technology too small for whatever he stuck on the side of his head by his eyelids are too small  yeah i don't buy it a lot of people saying uh other can't they're saying the 3d technology is 
[01:27:00]  a hoax hold on let me go to hoax let me go to chris in uh pittsburgh chris hey how you doing guys  hey brother hey yeah what's it called uh actually late last week i was reading up on uh you know some  what viral hoaxes are and shit like that and they said that it's a complete hoax they said it's just led  lights basically sticking to the guy's side of the guy's head and they just did some sort of video  editing yeah yeah just to basically mess with people and get them all like oh what the fuck's 
[01:27:30]  going on so yeah it's it's complete bull you could see like something was weird with his eyes they  were like hey kent you see what you just did to yourself you said i have one more thing you had  you had an a plus phone call now we got to give you a b minus either one minus for your phone call  and i hope it's real all right thank you kent and thank you chris in pittsburgh  hey no problem all right man uh let me say hi to chad in jersey chad hey uh i saw king's speech  in the theater and a lot of people were laughing they should be yeah absolutely i mean i was laughing 
[01:28:00]  my wife was laughing and nobody was like hey hey that's not okay shit like that of course it's okay  if someone's stuttering you laugh i'm and i'm sorry for the stutterers out there no you mean you're  sorry for them sorry florentine's the biggest piece of shit like he laughs at domestic violence  scenes in movie theaters like once for warriors was so good had such brutality in it and he was  laughing when like fucking jake the muss is fucking savagely beating his wife 
[01:28:30]  and then others saying they weren't laughing in the theater they saw the movie in so  cool now i'm disconnected again good you're disconnected again why what happened oh i don't know  what what happened what happened that's some kind of computer magic speaking of technology i was  reading an article on um you see what they're trying to do with the cell phones and texting  i don't know how they get this done though you can't do it when you're driving yeah they're trying 
[01:29:00]  to get this done and they're trying to get uh you know like the the at&t's and the verizons on board  and basically your phone what if you're in the car with somebody who's fucking driving that's what  they that thank you because that's what i read in the article they're like yeah how the fuck do  they know who is driving and texting at the same time what if you're just a passenger board you got  an eight-hour ride so you're on your phone the whole fucking time how about you know what if you're  in a bus or something how would they stop technologically trying to do everything how  that you figure out drinking and driving first assholes hey i figured it out drinking and you 
[01:29:30]  you know what drinking and driving obviously really bad but that texting it's amazing how much worse  i know i could go 70 and text sorry i know i could do it but there are people out there that  can't fucking do it here's the problem is uh when you're drinking and driving or you're around people  that are drinking and driving let's say it's saturday night you're fucking driving home uh you're gonna  get some people weaving and go like oh that guy's fucking drunk right look at him it's very watch him  it's obvious uh but when you you have people texting and driving it's every day during like noon 
[01:30:00]  you're driving and just seeing people coming over into your lane oh yeah you're like oh this is  great now there's 20 times more at least probably a hundred times more around you i see people that  are still weaving in and out of lanes and driving like they're way more people i'm just gonna reiterate  what you just said fucking coming into your lane because they're texting then then because they're  drunk way more way more it's not even close it's a lot more dangerous i think but they're trying to 
[01:30:30]  get this technology i really don't know how that how they could figure that shit out but they're  trying either and but it would be voluntary which is stupid too because who would sign up for that  plan like they have that technology are you gonna go you know i gotta sign up for this plan to make  sure i don't i personally don't text when i'm driving yeah obviously it would help the parents  parents the parents and their kids but parents the girl's trying to make a call while she's being  raped in in the fucking car and she can't how about that but you know what i i say the kids know 
[01:31:00]  how to drive and text because that's all they know it's the old people that never had it before  now like fuck i could text and drive the same time they can't figure it out well old people shouldn't  be fucking driving then my fucking texting are driving god are they bad let's get out of the way  right lane move three abreast fucking despicable trying to get somewhere right i don't have to be  right away but i feel compelled to get there fast i'm the worst i love it roland yes anything else 
[01:31:30]  about movies uh i saw the company man this week company man that's pretty good how's that what's  that movie about with uh ben affleck about uh the unemployment what's going on like a big company  laid them off and struggled to find a job and i saw the dilemma oh how bad was that it's getting  horrible speech probably got more laughs oh really yeah the one was with uh who uh kevin  james and uh oh kevin james right and uh vince vaughn i like kevin but vince i'm tired of 
[01:32:00]  i i saw kevin james's stand-up he's very he's funny yeah his movies suck though this is vince being  his movies suck yeah he played the fat guy in grown-ups he did all the fat jokes yeah he was supposed to be in  this movie but since he they say he brings in more money than will smith kevin james wow does he really  for what people actually think he's funny out there america loves him middle america it was supposed to 
[01:32:30]  be it was supposed to be vince vaughn and paul giamatti for the dilemma oh really like a miserable  friend and uh that's a ron howard flick right yeah trying to do some comedy it was painful  painfully bad yeah i i hung in there for two and a half it was like two hours two hours five minutes  ron howard wouldn't come in i'm glad his movie was awful yeah why didn't he come in for that  hey yeah probably because he saw it oh he probably nursed he would have called in but  it's you know a lot of laughter right a lot of laughs yeah shut up really bad yeah i mean it's a few 
[01:33:00]  laughs i mean but the paper is they found a couple dummies to give it a good review for the uh for the  um advertising they probably made the poster that's why give me the paper i mean it's right there  laugh out loud funny yeah yeah the dallas star the those are guys that have no fucking pride the ones  the ones they go to when they know their movie's so bad yeah and say hey man i need a good review  for my movie so i could uh get the advertising of the paper and they'll and they're shameless yeah 
[01:33:30]  no problem who will do it or call ben lyons it's always some weird like never heard of type of  reviewer from uh from a never heard of type of blog that they can quote yeah yeah yeah and he  wants to be quoted give me the paper let's see if it's in there right now yeah or they get jeffrey  lyons son ben lyons oh is he a whore beyond one they can both ben lyons is a whore he'll do this  shit massive whore really i didn't know that because they should point out the whores well they take 
[01:34:00]  him out they like he'll fly to cairo to interview the cast of jumper right and then he'll come back  saying it's the best action movie you must see it and jumper sucked right oh yeah i never saw a jumper  you see jumper in nope no desire to see the jumper no desire there's so many movies i just look at and  go i'll never see that i don't care to see it and it doesn't bother me if i never see it uh so many of  them and occasionally there's those middle ground movies where i'll be like uh what's this i'll catch it 
[01:34:30]  right right at the beginning you'll be like something looks interesting here right i don't  realize what it is and go ew yeah i think i wanted to watch that i'll see natural treasure on tbs like  12 times yeah that was good is it obviously yeah they don't have the movie uh advertising  advertisements today it was all in yesterday's paper and i couldn't believe it i'm seeing these  great reviews for dilemma i'm like the movie's getting fucking horrible reviews on rotten tomatoes  so who is this whore and i meant to make a mental note of the whore that decided to sell his soul 
[01:35:00]  so he could be in the paper so he's a gala good review for dilemma yeah that is one of them they do it  for every movie yeah it's not in today's paper unfortunately so that was a waste of time  which means we should just fucking break oh  we lost jimmy for the for the day i think jimmy is uh he's so obsessed with the whole internet 
[01:35:30]  problem that no he's not obsessed he's upset oh look he's yelling as i say that dude what happened  jimmy jimmy is so and and and and i just i just told i just told anthony that we lost you for the  for the show i'm having a literally fucking i don't know why a bad internet connection makes me so  angry but i have i know why this is a media company we should never have to talk about how we have a 
[01:36:00]  bad internet connection this isn't some fucking plumbing company on a mac you have a little it looks  like a slice of pizza a pizza wedge which shows you this the connection strength starting from  the lines get darker as they go up i have full connection strength and i am getting kicked offline  every fucking 10 minutes it is infuriating how many times i can't even talk about it i don't i don't

[01:40:00]  error messages they're like what is this strange invasion it's the internet is it flassing that  yes yes it won't i i purposely leave the h's because um what happens is they they call me the  over h using key so i put them down sometimes thank you dad well there you go cat five well at least  they figured out our super bowl trip which is good so we'll see you guys down and down one of the  funniest things ever they let me ask i'm not saying they are but does sales here not do what 
[01:40:30]  they're supposed to do or is it just one of those things there is you know what fuck it what do i  have to lose there's a lot of people around here that don't do what they're supposed to do but i  mean aside from us i mean a lot of people they actually came to us and said hey you guys want  to go to the super bowl and i laughed down like yeah i do but it's impossible at this point you have  to you have to plan for a super bowl minimum i would say six months six months out minimum six  months out they came to us a couple weeks ago and said uh we're we're putting a super bowl trip  together i laughed at him like uh what plan do you think you're on you can't fucking plan a super 
[01:41:00]  bowl two three maybe i'm exaggerating a month out i don't even think it was a month no it wasn't even  it was like a couple of weeks it was a couple weeks ago which would technically be i guess a  month out and i'm looking at i'm like this is the type of thing you got to do almost a year in  advance to be safe can't six months maybe you could get it plan a super bowl party or party uh  appearance where the show has to fly to a location halfway across the country right we don't have  uh you need to make yes you're on relationships and and fucking hotels yes logistics uh i just 
[01:41:30]  want to go on saying that since last january when you guys said you wanted to go to the super bowl  i've been on their case about you going been saying at sales meetings and other stuff and i kept  being told that oh it's we got time we got time it's too far out since last year yeah and this is  the stuff that drives me nuts and you bring it up and and then uh you're you guys bitch too much well 
[01:42:00]  yeah because we want things done right every when i was allowed to go to the super bowl it's a big deal  but you can't come to us a couple weeks ago and go hey you guys want to go to the super bowl we're  trying to make that happen i'm like what what we would we would be in a hotel in austin  at this point i wouldn't mind who cares austin's pretty cool be a nice trip right thank you i was  willing to go just for the trip i thought just to do it and make fun of it i never and and and  and god's honest i didn't even think twice i never expected this to come to fruition no i right when it 
[01:42:30]  was brought up i was like uh hey would you guys like to you know go down to super bowl and and  broadcast and i went of course i went yeah yeah that sounds great but i wasn't like hey i'm going to the  super bowl i just went like okay how long before this falls apart and then it was you know a couple  weeks yeah it kept getting waved off of course literally waved oh we'll get to that because a  lot of people don't know what they're doing around here i thought of so many things and places and 
[01:43:00]  and and just events that we've done over the years on nothing by the way on shoestring budget where it was  just us in a club us fucking hey you know we want to thank the listeners so we're going to go to a  bar and just fucking hang out with our listeners for a while no broadcast no sponsored event note  that but but now it's just that shit just doesn't happen nah this doesn't happen this is the same  thing that uh happened with homeless shopping spree when we tried to uh i remember bring the softball 
[01:43:30]  games back well the homeless shopping spree was brilliant because they actually came to me and said  we're going to get this done for you yeah and uh and then when they turned into and then when they  decided they needed to ask the malls for permission i'm like okay there's yeah i guess we're not going  to be doing the homeless shopping spree we need the mall but they sign off on the fact that if a  homeless guy fucking rapes a three-year-old uh well the the mall isn't responsible right so but then you  get that answer and also oh there wasn't enough time to get everything together but we were pitching 
[01:44:00]  it since the summer i i i i know i i know the real deal you could say whatever you want to my  face just bringing it up i i know the real deal do you know yes uh jim um what did you just say  i lost my thought about uh homeless shopping spree shopping oh right but i when i did the last piece  for for for the tonight show it was uh we went to arizona and we shot this piece outdoors it was like a  a silly contest and uh the winner got tickets for the bcs right and i i just kept saying to them 
[01:44:30]  because it's such a i'm like do you know how impossible everything we're doing right now would  be in radio like do you know how the lawyers and i i know people get sick of the lawyers but literally  i nbc did it for for to be filmed like do you know how badly this would get fucked up  by fucking lawyers in the rate and i don't know why radio is so much harder to do  than television when it comes to attorneys i don't know why i really don't either but literally they 
[01:45:00]  are so fucking paranoid it's like just get insurance i can't even watch some shows anymore  without the only thing i'm thinking is how the fuck did they get this done i was watching myth  busters the other day and it was that one when they had a 747 and uh what they would do is crank  the engines up full blast on the runway and then tow uh various vehicles like a taxi cab and a school 
[01:45:30]  bus behind 747 jet engines and watch it fling get flung it it's like how did they do that who talked to  where they went yep i got a 747 did you see jackass 3d they had a they had a they you know lit up an  engine and they were trying to like run into the run into it and piss into the you can't you they  won't let us piss in the studio because it's obscenity but they can piss on jackass yeah yeah they 
[01:46:00]  were throwing shoes into the uh into the jet wash to try to like smack into other people it's like  fucking it makes no sense how come nothing could be done are we going to be allowed to keep that  wire without a an email chain i guarantee there's going to be some kind of problem with jimmy's wire  uh this is pretending can you label that jimmy's wire jimmy's wire i already did you don't think i  didn't foresee all of this jimmy's wire i want to see how long it takes before they yank that out go 
[01:46:30]  look you didn't go through the proper channels we're gonna have to yank the wire until we uh email back  and forth for the next three weeks straight insert executive's name here yeah uh jimmy's wire the  internet wire we we're gonna have to talk about this um give me a call back if you can uh um  engineering it was put in without their uh knowledge and um there's something about the  if switch um switch that has to be uh taken care of and this will cause a problem so uh jimmy jimmy's wire 
[01:47:00]  uh i sent a memo out called jimmy's wire jimmy's wire jimmy's wire jimmy's wire is gonna be a  problem i i guarantee you i don't blame the individuals i blame the guy who put the system  in place yes where it has to be all sorts of emails and you got to go to the proper channel  you gotta get legal permission then plus they have to set up an official uh you gotta start rules that  apply to using the wire you gotta start the seventh floor and eventually you'll have a meeting on the 
[01:47:30]  first floor of course you have to have a meeting on every floor between 37 and the first floor and  then maybe the wire will be able to stay thank you maybe maybe thank you poor jimmy's wire is so  short for this world can you say something jack la lane let everybody down let's stop already  96 years old this fucking guy should have made it to 100 without even fucking flinching what are we 
[01:48:00]  talking about winnie churchill there winnie churchill yeah winston churchill died big fat  cigar smoking fuck who had the stress of world war ii on him and and didn't exercise at all  didn't eat properly ate a horrible english fatty foods could you could you look up winston churchill  maybe winston churchill died now he died 46 years ago today at the age of 90 46 years ago the food was  really bad for you i mean really horrid the cigarettes were way worse for you uh you know 
[01:48:30]  46 years ago and that's when he died actually yeah you know the prime of his life was a real  fucking long time ago and and he made it to 90 without even trying yep without even trying to keep  his body in shape he was fight he was fat man it's amazing right massive it's a disaster lane didn't have  a scoop of ice cream in the last 50 years no him in a dumb juicer didn't enjoy himself and he  fucking only made it to 96 and like you said earlier george burns smoked his way to a hundred 
[01:49:00]  smoked his way cigars every day living on the road i'm telling you this jack of the lane let a lot of  people down proving that exercise and eating right just doesn't work in the end all he did his whole  life is exercise and and eat properly and drank his juice right he didn't have a nice juicy steak on a  friday night oh not sacrifice all that uh all that pleasure oh god uh no the wire was not installed 
[01:49:30]  by a union guy that could be a problem that's a bum toe the union uh guy would have been very upset  yeah we're not a lot of touch technical stuff around here so there's gonna be there'll be some  please when the problem hits i don't care what time it is today please please let us email me and  and jimmy the uh the fact that d-boy and danny fixed the problem in a mere matter of minutes  something we've been bitching about for a year been so long this problem's been going on is uh 
[01:50:00]  typical look at this place falling down they were supposed to redesign the studio it's just kind of  sitting in limbo it's starting to kind of take on the feel of a hoarder this fucking studio you see  the piles hoarder's house you see the piles look around corner i don't even know what that is like  it's just no one gives a fuck no they signed the big guy and that's all that matters everybody else  will now just go back to business as usual that's their philosophy i'm not even bitching that at the 
[01:50:30]  guy himself you know god bless you if you could fucking squeeze money out of these guys because  we tried and we failed miserably squeeze a load out it was my own all of my stomach yeah i'll take  that all right we got uh we didn't play kevin smith talking about bruce willis yeah yeah i want to  hear about that mark marins right because he hinted he hinted to us too he kind of hinted because he was  in the middle of uh promoting the movie at that point now jimmy do you see anything on set that might  have led you to believe there was a problem because you did a scene i did with bruce willis yes and did 
[01:51:00]  you see anything that might have led you to believe there's there could be an issue here no well bruce  was here's what i noticed he was uh very much he was kind of directing with kevin like and i'm sure  that's not kevin's choice but bruce was kind of like let's do this let's uh and you know he seemed  like he was very dominating on the on the uh scene you do with yeah and somebody said to me 
[01:51:30]  it was not kevin it was actually somebody on the on the behind the cameras that's not famous  side and said uh well he knows he's the reason we got 50 million or whatever it was so you know uh  but it didn't again i only saw the one day and he didn't seem it didn't seem like there's any  tension between them it just seemed like wow he's really got a lot to say kevin kind of hinted on our  show and then uh my brother went saw him in the round out there at the old uh westbury music fair  whatever the fuck they're called now i think it was westbury music fair and uh wow he openly talks 
[01:52:00]  about it in his stage show now yeah yeah now he has got no qualms about he went on mark maron's  podcast which is which is quickly it's a great podcast man quickly becoming the podcast to listen  to the new york times in an article on it i think it made rolling stone magazine yeah mark maron's onto  something sorry mark is a great he's a really good interviewer um i didn't mean to go from great to  really good but he i mean he like really fucking uh he has smart questions he's engaging it's a  fucking great w what what the fuck wtf it's a great podcast yeah you could get it on itunes and 
[01:52:30]  all over the place but uh kevin smith on mark maron's podcast check this out well i'll tell you  honestly i i might make an argument that marketing of cop-out might have diminished your ticket sales  because that that pilster was that billboard was fucking everywhere and i gotta be honest with  kevin i mean i looked at that that billboard and i said i've already seen that movie yeah of course  yeah there was nothing about that poster that was screamed like holy shit am i right original but to  be fair yeah nothing about the movie was the whole movie is it's an homage pictures but we just wanted 
[01:53:00]  to make an 80s beverly hills cop it had to look like right something you'd seen before um that at least  that's what i hope they were thinking right but i probably look i know the real story the one guy  wouldn't even sit for a fucking poster shoot so essentially they have to go like okay we got one guy  names all of a sudden everybody knows who it is it ain't uh let me put it this way remember the  really funny guy in the movie it ain't him he's a fucking dream tracy morgan holy shit he wouldn't  even fucking sit for a poster a poster shoot that's fucking fucking dick 
[01:53:30]  let me put it this way remember the really funny guy in the movie it ain't him he's a fucking dream  tracy morgan i i would lay down in traffic for the rest of my life for tracy morgan his work not  for tracy i might have killed either myself or someone else in the making of fucking you were  disappointed beyond disappointed it was it was uh look i went into that's why you went into the  movie it was one of the main reasons yeah i mean look while i was there i was able to accomplish 
[01:54:00]  everything else i needed to accomplish and as much as learn about marketing understand how to work on a  team with others and shit and you know what honestly you were given the gift of not having to tell  your dad that bruce willis was a dick yeah ultimately there's that but let me tell you  i'm sure he knew he knew from the fucking jump uh i wish he just could have communicated to me from  the afterlife um yeah it was tough it was difficult dude i've never been involved in a situation like 
[01:54:30]  that where um one component does not come he's not he's not in it he's not in the box at all yeah  it's not he's just doing a job so he can get by i i've heard of yeah it was it was fucking soul  well i'm sorry about that really so but again that's not a lot of people are just trying to  blame the movie on him no but look i had no fucking help from this dude whatsoever but the sad part  the sad part of that story on a personal level is as a kid who grew up in new jersey who loved  fucking bruce willis and you get this big opportunity and you get disappointed by your  fucking hero i mean that is really the worst moment and it's something that you're probably going to 
[01:55:00]  have to do again uh given the business that you're in you say no no he changed everything for me  though i just mean meeting people that you know but that's the thing i'm saying he changed that  for me because now i'll never meet anybody like that was it i was just like shattered yeah forget  it like i'd rather like people from a distance yeah that's that's that's like seeing superman  without his cape you get so disappointed go oh this is what this guy really is about i remember how  psyched he was uh when bruce willis like signed he's like dude die hard i'm getting to work with 
[01:55:30]  fucking bruce willis and then it just turned into a fucking nightmare but you know what though  most people and again i haven't worked with him on that level that kevin did most people i've met  have not been disappointing yeah like literally ozzy's the greatest guy on fucking earth he's a  sweet guy and most of them are like yeah where are the birthday gifts i didn't say his memory is  terrific where are the birthday gifts those beatles books are still around here somewhere  they never came back for him here's why ozzy's a great guy because he should have fucking thrown them at 
[01:56:00]  me but he actually pretended he liked them but you know what i mean like most guys i've met have  been really cool i mean you get a couple of dicks here and there but i'd say 90 percent of them have  been great so it's worth it's still worth meeting and i'm terrific when i meet people everyone says it  you sure are  yeah i did see bruce uh you saw i well i i kevin smith invited me to uh a night shoot car chase scene with  uh bruce wilson tracy morgan it was awesome it was such a great night and uh there were sick kids 
[01:56:30]  on the set that night and i saw bruce basically he could give a fuck that these kids and they were  part of the program where well check this out because we know you're gonna die soon  the make-a-wish kids yeah there's no hope yeah they were on set yeah they had a nice ice cream  truck for everybody let's all have ice cream beautiful and bruce was so dismissive  so fucking dismissive could give a fuck it is and everybody was affected you could not  not be affected it was brutal i wonder what that is they were full of life and you know their lives 
[01:57:00]  weren't gonna fucking be too much longer do you think kevin is too much of a nice guy to tell you  the truth do you think he's too nice to deal with like like actor because he's always for the most  part before that is dealt with uh people he knows and uh you know people that came up about the same  time he did things like that and he knows how to direct people he knows he's done that very well 
[01:57:30]  over the years now you get someone like bruce willis he's been in the business forever he's had  successful huge fucking action movies diehard shit like that and then like do you think i don't think  a bruce willis would respect kevin smith unless kevin came across like hey i'm directing this  motherfucker but that isn't kevin no you answered your own question because bruce willis thinks of  himself and we all think of him as a big time action hero he probably went on set and said there's a lot  of action in this movie i know way more than you could possibly know about this shit so you we're gonna do 
[01:58:00]  it my way yeah but kevin as the director maybe should have stepped in like like hey my movie i'm  director you're you're fucking the the the star right of the movie you listen to me i saw i mean  i was lucky enough to be on set for one night and i saw just nothing but like just a very like  carefree atmosphere everyone was just like it's like that's kevin though everyone was just having  a good time you know yeah so yeah i don't know i don't know we don't know that business i don't know 
[01:58:30]  maybe maybe if you if you if you lay down the hammer like that then you're not going to get a  good performance from uh bruce willis now he's gonna be a little pissed inside like how dare you  fucking lay down the hammer on me a major action star so maybe it's it's political look at like  pulp fiction right look at the pulp fiction uh bruce willis was was great in that he's fucking great in  that and uh is that like tarantino being able to be a fucking maniac on set you know right and get 
[01:59:00]  exactly what he wanted out of bruce willis because i think the first thing he said is i don't want to  see that little smirky smile from fucking uh you know his old moonlighting show right yeah but that  wasn't like an action flick i mean pulp fiction certainly had some action scenes but it was a lot  deeper than that total action fucking so maybe bruce willis's scenes maybe bruce felt like he  was out of his element so i better really listen to the director so i could get a good performance 
[01:59:30]  going here i have a feeling car chase he was in fights he was in fucking uh gun gunfire and shit  like that do you know by the way to interrupt you because you just said something i'm reading i have  an old email because i'm looking at something hey jim i'm a reporter at the new york times i'm writing  a profile on mark maron and his podcast hoping you have a few minutes to talk i've got plenty of stuff on  mark but nothing from a comic who's known him over the years that was december 13th oh shit i want  to read your email you could be i do actually i get so much money i'm so i could have been the times 
[02:00:00]  article yeah whoops i don't know yeah you're right i mean pulp fiction certainly had enough action shit  going on yeah and what was what was bruce willis doing like around pulp fiction time was that almost  like did did did quentin kind of like hey let me pluck you out of obscurity too he helped him and  john travolta i'm not sure that's a fucking hero right there because uh maybe he was a little more 
[02:00:30]  humble i humble you i humble you well we've had camel clutch and fuck you in ass next time we talk to  tarantino we've had him on the show we gotta ask him maybe we'll back up what kevin's saying maybe he  will i believe kevin but kevin's just a nice guy which unfortunately for a director i you know it's  very hard to be a nice guy with everybody it depends like again spielberg or when you look at  a guy like clint eastwood clint eastwood is probably not a yeller but nobody who works and i'm sure it's 
[02:01:00]  not that bruce doesn't respect kevin it's just bruce is bigger like on that set bruce could probably call  the studio and and have more impact than kevin could because he's bruce willis but if it's clint  eastwood you you know what are you gonna do fucking argue with clint eastwood on the set  you look like an asshole yeah you can't i don't know i don't know what the answer is like clint  eastwood though is clint eastwood he has like why is why is bruce he gets respect because he's  fucking clint eastwood and from what i've heard with his directing style he is kind of like a yeah 
[02:01:30]  you listen to me you know he people will listen to him i'm not saying kevin you know kevin is a  relatively young director but why and why does bruce willis have to be such an asshole the rest  of the guys on that exactly were an asshole exactly they don't have to be wasn't an asshole  what did we john william scott wasn't an asshole pulp fiction so we were looking at striking distance  before that loaded weapon one death becomes her the last boy scout okay so that was like the last 
[02:02:00]  good movie you made was 91 and pulp fiction was 94 yeah okay that's 17 years hudson hawk billy bathgate  mortal thoughts yeah okay those are all movies yeah and then after pulp fiction we got like uh  and die hard after pulp fiction you got uh new die hard you got uh 12 monkeys  which is great fifth element which i like which everyone else hates fifth element i like fifth 
[02:02:30]  element apocalypse sixth sense was huge yeah unbreakable i liked unbreakable did you i liked  unbreakable yeah a lot of people bashed that because it's fucking m like shamalamalam no that was a good  one but i liked that one yeah that was kind of cool they should have shown his uh hidden talent a  little more what do you mean took a little i thought there was gonna be a sequel tell you the truth  yeah it took a little too long for for all that to unfold i thought was my problem with the 
[02:03:00]  fucking well that's stupid m light shamalamalam ding dong it's got a fucking character development  is 99 of the movie the element of surprise has to be the last two minutes of the film how about how  about you give us a little uh element of surprise halfway through the fucking film you fucking ding  dong you're fucking you're doofus what was the last uh movie you saw by him by m night  mm-hmm i tried to watch the devil the devil yeah that's that elevator one oh fuck i don't even 
[02:03:30]  know about that exactly correct a window i saw the one where they thought they were in the uh what  the 1400s village it was yeah the village like jimmy's impression they couldn't see  you're trying to tell me not one airplane or fucking went flying by opie they explain that they  fucking change the flight path oh really of airplanes really and wouldn't let it fly over  that area yeah not one train whistle in the distance no they had choo-choo trains back then 
[02:04:00]  didn't they yeah but i don't know they sounded uh a little different back in the 1400s  what that was so stupid this fucking so stupid with me it started and ended with the sixth sense  man that movie was so goddamn good i like signs too because i saw it early it was fun that was  kind of creepy a little bit yeah weird signs wasn't bad i guess you're right but six cents man  because i got to see it early before everyone ruined it for everybody else i was blown away by 
[02:04:30]  that plot twist holy shit yeah that one when you didn't know and that was like oh oh oh wait a  minute yeah and it yeah that was good and little hailey joel osmond was really good in it who's now 30  i'm not even like i'm thinking is he no no he's in his uh 20s he's a fuck up though isn't he yeah  pretty much yeah i think he had a little dewey action out there in holly he's one of those child 
[02:05:00]  stars that like was too good and too cute as a kid to do anything when they get older he was a  superstar too yeah yeah now he's just like now he looks like a big dopey version of little hailey  joel osmond he just looks like a college kid now like yeah yeah oh yeah  kegger gonna go see burning man  what do you look like  look at him  i'm in a fraternity he looks like owen wilson i see drunk people 
[02:05:30]  i see high people  get it from my movie  i got like seven senses or something  well that was fun while lasting shit  jimmy killed in austin we know that thank you for letting everyone know  awesome it's good jimmy it was great a lot of hardcore fans man  that's cool because we were never on regular radio down there

[02:11:30]  said that they did a bunch of stuff where you know they wouldn't show a lot that's not bad though look  at that look good but then they got the jacket kind of covering up some of the boobs yeah she covered  up a lot what uh what year was this that's uh important to the story i i sure well you got to  figure out when her career went bad and then two years later the playboy comes yeah it's a formula  it really is look it up for yourself there's a formula to this playboy thing debbie gibson went 
[02:12:00]  playboy 2005 really okay and tiffany definitely went before that that's a while ago this guy saw the  movie you're talking about 2002 okay rob in indiana rob hey you guys have to check out youtube they've  got that stalker guy he also stalks alissa milano oh yeah they've touched on that in the movie too that  he did uh stalk alissa milano about how gorgeous she is he he's batshit crazy the guy is so fucking 
[02:12:30]  crazy he honestly thinks that uh he has a relationship with tiffany and that tiffany knows him and then he  showed a picture of tiffany and him and tiffany's boyfriend at the time uh the three of them  taking a picture together and he goes just look he goes look look at her boyfriend's eyes that's  nothing but jealousy nothing but jealousy he's looking going like oh boy thinking that you know  he's going to swoop in on her it was it was just ridiculous yeah um good movie though i'm gonna 
[02:13:00]  check it out on the netflix thing definitely i'm gonna do a little netflix later today do you know  that piece of shit ashton kutcher movie was like first at the box office of course i think green  hornet came in second uh no strings attached did 20 mil green hornet did 18 and dilemma did uh 9.7  it's a date movie king's speech did 9.2 and then uh rounding out your chips true grit  true grit still there how much has true grit made uh total so far uh 12 million i think it's probably 
[02:13:30]  a little more than that but i just blurred out a number it doesn't matter it doesn't matter  even naming the top five what what did you expect to be the top five it's all the movies they  advertise on tv that's all that's how that shit works hearted it really is at this point so  ridiculous oprah's got a secret she's gonna tell everybody yeah there's a big family secret oprah's  uh revealing on her i guess so the ratings really really in the shitter i gotta tell you own network 
[02:14:00]  you have to watch and i know i know how it sounds you don't even have to say it but this own right  they're doing uh a reality show based on the 25th year of oprah and i know it sounds horrible but you  gotta you gotta watch really oprah is a twat is she really she's not a nice lady is she a bitch and  you could tell by how the staff deals with her behind the scenes i would love to get eric logan 
[02:14:30]  on the phone but it certainly he's never saying of course not but she's not a nice person when  those cameras are not on really they set up the whole yosemite uh trip yeah that uh got a lot of  press she was supposed to camp for a day and a half and i think she made it the day and a half but  she was bitching the entire time and i'm sitting there at home going this is your show she's like  why do we have to do that we already did that why do your show why do i have to cook again and they're  they're trying to like get as much footage as possible to make the show good the whole time 
[02:15:00]  she's bitching her her friend gail king there actually comes across very likable and is telling  oprah you gotta do this and then an hour and a half and she's like i don't want to ride a mule  she goes i don't want to ride a mule for an hour and a half and the producers are like  we're trying to get good video here and she goes what if i just ride you know away and then just  come back we don't actually have to do the ride and they show that gail king's like no we really 
[02:15:30]  should do the ride we might get some fucking good stuff here and she bitched the whole fucking time  the whole time and it's her show they're doing it for her you gotta check it out just a little bit  just to see uh the real oprah i can't take watching any of her i hate when she yells  oh god everything has to have a yell right and the tone of her voice when she yells is infuriating 
[02:16:00]  i hate it i mean she built uh obviously this empire so i'm very curious to see you know the  inner workings of this thing yeah and they're all scared they have to have meetings with her and she's  behind her desk it looks like it's it's her home and it's it's just her office her office and they  sit there with like their fucking white house their notepads and they're scared to say anything  to her because she's just so dismissive talks down to everybody you gotta watch i'm telling you i don't 
[02:16:30]  even know why she would allow people to see what she really is like i can't even take it and they  joke about the lesbian thing by the way do they like oh boy this ain't gonna help the lesbian rumors  because they're going to sleep for the night and in the the one fucking trailer thing uh winnebago  whatever the fuck it's called of them and like oh this ain't gonna help the lesbian rumors they're  open they openly joke about it i really don't think she's a lesbian anymore i think i i think she's one 
[02:17:00]  of those uh like eunuchs what do they call those asexuals yeah doesn't have any sex i think it's an  asexual thing happened i think she's turned off by the whole thing in general i'm convinced of it now  i don't think she's maybe from her uh her past maybe that's what she's going to bring up maybe  that's her secret well the what secret is left she's she's pretty much talked about everything  right secrets might be that she's asexual because of the abuse she suffered when oh you think but  it says uh spills a family secret yeah family secret like like because of the abuse when i was a 
[02:17:30]  child um i uh i'm uh yeah don't have to say and then oprah said something racist about black people  not wanting to be what black people don't want to be homeless on uh weekends that's what she calls  camping when you go camping you're basically home it's pretty funny actually if you think about it  the concept is if you're one of those camping types you're basically saying yeah i'm gonna be  homeless for the weekend she said that but she goes black people don't like to be homeless on the 
[02:18:00]  weekends and i'm like wow that's kind of uh that's kind of edgy for the oprah kind of edgy because  if as a white person if you said you know black black people homeless on weekends that's what  camping is uh then you might get a little uh reverend al attention yeah a little bit you might  right yeah let me say hi to uh john and rocklin john hey what's up fellas hey man yeah i was uh i was  watching you know watching it with my old lady and uh you know i hear her say that about you know  black people shouldn't be going home that's why black people shouldn't be camping we don't want to 
[02:18:30]  pretend to be homeless for a weekend and i'm like are you serious did you really just say that  yeah maybe we could get the clip so these guys can hear it i don't know i don't know if it's easy  to get the own clips because uh you know whatever but yeah we we got to play that what so so you're  watching that shit behind the scenes yeah yeah well you know we're just watching i'm just seeing what's  going on you know it's kind of interesting you're right you can just admit you're watching it i i love  the people oh yeah it's on because my wife's watching i just happened to walk by the tv on the way to 
[02:19:00]  my man cave and i checked out of it it's okay to admit that you watch some faggy shit it really is  okay i know i'm not i'm not but doesn't she come across uh doesn't she kind of come across a little  twatty oh all the time but you know it's one of those situations where do i say that and you know  and live in the man camp for the weekend or just go oh yeah that was great why you're not allowed  to tell your wife that oprah comes across twatty on the own well you know kind of matter of not  being allowed but you just know what to say and you know what not to say yeah oh no so and one 
[02:19:30]  producer openly hates her uh yeah i'm telling you gotta watch it's it's worth watching one or two and  i'm telling you yeah and then we can talk about this a little bit when you catch the times where  she comes off very hypocritical and very you know like like more racist than you would really think  she is you have to sit there and go hmm well the camping trip to yosemite sounds like it would be a  blast for anybody she bitched the entire time and i get the impression that oprah really doesn't 
[02:20:00]  want to do anything just like she just wants to earn she wants to earn and then just go home to  do like what does she like doing i don't think she's ever really talked about what she likes doing  when she's not doing the tv show maybe that's what she'll talk about maybe that's surprising  really that she hoards uh cat carcasses how great would that be how great would that be  she just throws luggage that's it you realize that you know how much control does she really  have over over the show when you're sitting out there in the middle of you know in the middle 
[02:20:30]  of the woods somewhere right right it's all control all right thank you sir let me go to cat on long  i was watching the soup the other night and they had um oprah on she was interviewing john stewart  right i totally was dumbfounded and beside herself at the fact that john stewart didn't invite her on  the show first and made a huge issue she was like making fun of him actually on the on air and in the 
[02:21:00]  dressing room just she couldn't get over you could find it probably find a clip on it on youtube if  you wanted to she was such a fucking cunt i'm telling you which i hate her i'm really i'm really  surprised she's allowing people to see the side of her because she's she's been so controlling her  entire career like really hard to know who the real oprah is everything is you know what i mean  held tightly to the what do they call it the vest or whatever she better and this show is like  just shows her being a bitch well it doesn't surprise me because i think she's so far removed 
[02:21:30]  from reality that you know i don't even think she realizes that she's not on the same plane we are  i mean you would have common courtesy for people but she the first thing she said to him when he got  out was he didn't invite you on your show and i'm like that's fucking john stewart you're you know what  i mean i just got info thank you cat i'm a little distracted i know what the fucking uh secret is i  really do do you no fucking gag you want to try to guess what the secret is how do you know i this 
[02:22:00]  guy is on the guy's on the phone and because they already taped the show so the secret's out there  uh-huh i so how do you know it's real huh how do you know it's real i i i would bet money you bet  money okay so it's not guaranteed but i would bet money and we'll go to this phone call what you  want to guess the secret don't look down i'm not looking at the what's the secret it's not the  lesbian thing it's not gonna be the asexual thing what do you think the family secret is 
[02:22:30]  there was some uh there was some sexual abuse in her family growing up right yeah and she talked  about that already all right so it's not that family secret family secret is there a member of  her family that is famous that she never mentioned yes there is that's jimmy that was me there is  all right i i'm not gonna say i think it's this guy joe is it ted winfrey no is joe mighty  oh god no he's very strong no no is he not old no no i just heard i didn't even hear any detail 
[02:23:00]  i just heard it was this guy she was gonna reveal yeah ted winfrey it's very funny reveal yes i was  i was raised a poor black boy and you should get this one um i really think you should get this  one all right is it a member of the family family secret do the words high tensile steel have anything  you don't feel like playing today just said high tensile steel i love high tensile steel who doesn't

[02:45:30]  i just can't stop  it gets worse and worse  every year  i'm telling you man  i cannot quit  i can't quit smoking  they're starting to taste like shit  but i  dude you got a cigarette in your butt man  chew some fucking gum or something  you got a stogie in your hiney buddy 
[02:46:00]  i'm telling you  chew some gum  get a mint  get a toothpick  there's other ways  yeah we're done with that shit  i'm just really tired man  that is so good  yeah two boogie did a great job with bowling  uh bowling for behave yes 
[02:46:30]  that really is a great job drew boogie did  my god he just took my ramblings  and put it to auto tuner  bravo  and all of a sudden it's a little ditty  drew boogie's a talented motherfucker  listen to that guitar just talk to you man  that's what it's saying  i don't know  he's talking the language of love  flavor flavor flaves 
[02:47:00]  you hear what he's up to  what's the flave doing now  oh when he's not uh hijacking radio broadcast  yeah  he's uh you know the reality uh show thing has dried up for the flave  thank god  he had a nice run there  so now he's opening up uh chicken places  in iowa  wow  or one he's going with one in iowa  small place too  like a i mean a small like town  i think there's only like 26 000 people in the town 
[02:47:30]  and he decided that place needs chicken  that's the place uh for chicken huh  and then he's hoping that uh  he could open up hundreds of these across america  what's flavor flaves chicken place called  do we know  flavorful  i bet though a small town  he'll go there  and him making an appearance there  will get a lot of people down  that's actually a smart move  because he'll be blown away that flave is there  this probably might be a smart place to do it  yeah  uh clinton iowa 
[02:48:00]  clinton iowa  rapper and reality tv star  blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah  99 cent wings blah blah blah  but it doesn't say how many people live in this town  in the paper i think it said  doesn't sound like clinton iowa has a lot of people though  no  what the fuck is he doing  he's trying to fucking make a living  yeah but  opening a chicken place in the middle of nowhere  his people are  he doesn't even know what he's doing  oh is that it  come on  you think flavorful flavor is sitting here going  let's work on the recipe today 
[02:48:30]  there's no fucking idea  it's not ffc  ffc  flavorful as chicken  flavorful as chicken  yeah ffc  i'm telling you man  i came up with the idea today  they should just fucking sell chicken skin  all spiced up  and nice and crispy  maybe he'll do that  take your advice  why not man  you get the beef jerky  why not a little chicken skin  already prepared  yeah the flavor is bigger  when you buy from this  i can't even hear that  oh  sorry  is this the commercial 
[02:49:00]  is this him talking about his chicken  all right yeah  then he's checking out  so that's  whoa what is that  he looks like he's in a fast food place  or something  there's a big picture of him  up on a wall and shit  he's some chicken  motherfucker  yeah he's talking about his chicken  is he  oh he is  you want to hear about  flavorful flavorful  reveals his secret recipe  it says  it's time to retire the clock  yeah enough of the clock  we get it  it was your gimmick  back in the olden days  you don't have to wear the clock anymore  we get it  you like clocks  yeah 
[02:49:30]  you kind of date shit  because no one has clocks  anymore  no one  all right here's him  talking about the chicken  i want to be known  to be up in my spot  active  you know what i'm saying  you're going to find me  in here  working  you know what i'm saying  you're going to catch me in here  seasoning up my chicken  flouring up my chicken  frying up my chicken  and not only that  but coming out here  and serving my chicken  to people  you know what i'm saying  you're going to find me doing that  you know what i'm saying 
[02:50:00]  and plus  being that  Nick built this  for Flav  because he has  his heart  into the business  i want to be the first  to cook chicken  in my own spot  you know  that's why i fried up  some chicken last night  so now  i don't care  how many pieces of chicken  get cooked up in here  i know for a fact  once Nick was done  with this place  i was the first one 
[02:50:30]  to cook chicken in here  inside my own place  how was it  that was great  it was  it was great  it was alright  put it this way  because of the  you know  the pot that we used  last night  chicken didn't really  fry like i wanted it to  it kind of like  boiled in the grease  but we had fun  last night  frying up this chicken  last night  and eating it  yeah  he just had  our own little  personal party 
[02:51:00]  this is really sad  can you stop this  it's really fucking sad  wow  that's why  that's why we definitely  gotta quit soon  because  this is what happens  to everyone's career  you end up  fucking  fat guys  you end up  fucking selling  chicken somewhere  he was in public enemy  and not even well  and not even well  foot  that was like  listening to a Jew  but that's what  happens to everyone's  career  it eventually  gets to a point  where it's just  really sad  that was like  listening to a Jew  open his penny store 
[02:51:30]  I'm going to be  polishing them  and I'm going to be  making them shiny  and selling them  collecting them  you should come  did he really open it up  next to a KFC too  yeah  once I could figure out  how to get this  fucking ad to go away  is that TMZ's horse shit  I hate those fucking ads  I like 5-11  he smiles with coffee  I used to  I used to  check out the TMZ  but now  you know  you gotta get through  the paintball game  to fucking  read something  look  it's just 
[02:52:00]  splatters  yeah  it splats  and then  you gotta read that ad  and then you  and then you  close that ad  and then another  fucking paintball  splatter happens  so you don't know  what the fuck  Lindsay Lohan's up to now  TMZ  you're fucking it up  assholes  you and your stupid  fucking coffee drink  refresh it  hit refreshing the thing  no  it's gonna happen again  no no  all right look  all right  we get to see  I just guessed  that Flavor Flav  open up his chicken joint  right next to KFC 
[02:52:30]  that's a smart business move  right there  that's really good  thinking so much of yourself  that you could take out  the colonel  yeah  with your dumb  with your dumb chicken recipe  but he's really  him and his clock  they're gonna take out  the KFC  and it's not like  one of those  proverbial  you know  right next door  no no  it's right next door  right next door  so you have to make  a quick decision  is it the Flavor Flav  that's been open  for a weekend  or is it the colonel  that's been around  since my fucking 
[02:53:00]  grandma came off the boat  yeah but Flav is selling  the wrap angle  so it'll be  have a drive by window  it's pretty funny  foot in the house  I know  you guys talking so much  about chicken  that's fast food  because they run quick  something like that  yeah there you go  that's how I'd phrase it  we're gonna learn about  Clinton Iowa  because we just need  to get the info out there  go ahead there Tony  just on Wikipedia  27,772 people 
[02:53:30]  with 93% white  and 3.22% black  he picked a white area  to open up a chicken joint  what a dope  bunching out  what a dope  you know what  we're done  it's probably just being  paid for  but he's probably  just using his name  the person who lives there  probably said  let me use you  to sell chicken  and they're just  using him as a pitchman  he went to a town  that has 27,000 people  they just pay money to him  90  about over 90% white 
[02:54:00]  and he opened it up  next to a KFC  great business plan  this could be the worst  business  this could be worse  than the Pop-Tart store  I'm telling you right now  Times Square Pop-Tart store  is that gone already?  yes  oh you weren't here last week  fucking closed up  because we were trying  to get to the  the Whopper bar  which is the new  sensation of Times Square  oh with Whoppers?  yeah where you make  your own Whopper  a million different ways  to have a Whopper  wait like a burger?  but for some reason  or candy Whoppers  no BK 
[02:54:30]  oh wow  a Whopper?  it's called the Whopper bar  and we decided  we have to try out  some Whoppers  from the Whopper bar  but why would you have  Whoppers in the morning?  that's stupid  they only sell eggs  even though it's called  the Whopper bar  wouldn't you have  fucking burgers  around the clock  if your name  is the Whopper bar?  we'd rather just sell  computers from like  war games  just unplug the  goddamn thing  hello  I like no pickles  yeah  the only winning move  is to not eat  this fattening shit  oh I love how 
[02:55:00]  the computer learns  boo  boo  computers don't learn  by playing chess game  or playing whatever  ticker  ticker  tick-tack-toe  if he hollers  let him go  yeah  eeny-meeny-miney-mo  catch a  well  there you have it  catch a chicken  entrepreneur  by the toe  you want to hear 
[02:55:30]  Flavor Flav  talk about the chicken  of course I do  hey you guys think  this dash cam video  is real  they're playing like  crazy today on CNN  and everywhere else  you saw it right  what happened  you saw it right  no what happened  fucking guy has a dash cam  and a tractor trailer  coming over from the  other side of the highway  it's like  he's gonna fucking die  and he swerves all the way  to the right  and misses the thing  yeah  but  but he wasn't like  he wasn't holy shit enough 
[02:56:00]  for that to happen  well as it's happening  it was on break.com  you're pretty smooth  until you know  it's everywhere  fucking eyeballs  are flying out of your head  should be on the front page  of break  this thing  became huge yesterday  yeah watch this  and tell me  holla  okay he's driving  dash cam crack  that looks fake  that's real  is that real  okay  look how close 
[02:56:30]  wow  like an action movie  holy fuck  wow  yes  yes  yes  I'm okay  but I'm suing  you hear the anger  in the guy's voice  he was hoping  that was gonna  take him out  he's done with this  stupid marriage  like shut up  yeah I'm okay  unfortunately  are you  why is the truck doing that  I thought I'd  finally be out of this  hell out of the U-turn  I hit an ice patch  oh what happened  Jimmy  Jimmy just fell off  his chair  Jimmy just fell 
[02:57:00]  I went to sit  on my chair  and the chair went left  and I didn't go far enough  and I just fell  that was great  yeah  I could have been killed  suing  I'm suing this place  I own serious  funny  I was secretly hoping  you've tripped over  your new wire  you know what served me  right for complaining  I fucking paralyzed myself  so you think that's real  yeah I think you're right  because the other traffic  told me that  why wasn't the guy like  holy shit  because he was doing the shit  he's making the move 
[02:57:30]  because the guy's in shock  yeah afterwards  catch him five minutes later  he was going  ah  yeah probably  holy fuck  probably  alright we're done  with the Flav I guess  that's just a horrible idea  worst business plan ever  I say worse than the  Pop Tart fucking store  that went down  was that supposed to be  there for a short period  I'm sorry  well that's  that's kind of how  they're spinning it  but I think these stores  go into Times Square  hoping they're going to  catch on and then they  keep you know  they could keep them there  that's my guess  yeah  but it was obviously  a horrible idea 
[02:58:00]  from day one  remember the opening day  no one was there  we were in the store  with like what  five people or something  yeah  there was no one in there  I can't wait till Wednesday  by the way  what's that  it's embarrassing  oh you already got yours  oh yeah  Wednesday is most embarrassing  tape day  I need my tape  I gotta get it from Joe  I haven't told anybody  what it is  the name  nothing  I have an idea  you know what it is  by the way  this voice you're hearing  hold on hold on  this voice you're hearing  is Anthony's friend Foot  obviously 
[02:58:30]  and you guys have played  in bands over the years  and were you in the band  when Anthony did this power ballad  the gay keyboards  you will be hearing  are  yes  that's from Joe Curry  he was in the band  was there ever a time  when you guys were proud  of the song  about maybe  two minutes after we did it  yeah yeah  it was  you know what  you gotta remember  this is going back  to the mid 80s  I know  this is like  crazy old shit  that like  we thought  yeah  this is like  what's  this is what's 
[02:59:00]  kind of taken off now  and let's try  to do something  it just was  the best thing  I like about  the best thing  I like about the song  is neither  Ant or I wrote it  yes  because there were  our songs  three of our songs  were in there  yeah  it was my brother  remained unscathed  yeah  nah  see  Joe Buck  nah  are we gonna have it  by Wednesday  oh yeah  Joe's got it right  if he doesn't  I happen to have a copy  alright yeah  can you get it to me 
[02:59:30]  I got it on a cassette  I'll try to get it down  actually I'm gonna be  on the road though  but I also  we're not gonna hear it  Wednesday  no no  we gotta  it's obvious  it's gotta be  my volume is fucked up  I'd play you a second  of this  it's bad  oh is it really  it might not be as bad  as Ant's but it's bad  why is my volume  not working on my Mac  is that a  it won't let me fucking  yeah it's not playing the volume  is it an audio disc  no but it won't play  any volume  hmm  it's the wire  no it was happening  last night  you got a bad wire  no 
[03:00:00]  one of those bad wires  I'm thinking  not his new wire  you wanna go back  to the 50's  yeah I wanna hear this  acid trip  Danny I have not  heard this yet  Danny the acid trip  what's the setup  on this damn thing  it was just like  recently uncovered  footage I suppose  of I guess  during the 50's  they were doing  a lot of LSD  research and testing  and so this woman  had signed up  to be part of  this research  project which  dealt with  hallucinogenics  and LSD  and so they  basically interviewed  her before  her acid trip 
[03:00:30]  and then during it  really  so you could  kind of hear  the difference  I was gonna ask you  is it as good  as the hot dog lady  no I don't think  anything is as good  because hot dog lady  wasn't real  hot dog lady  was just what  somebody  what some  people who didn't  like acid  wanted you to think  acid was like  the hot dog  started talking to me  I done plenty of acid  nothing  the food products  never fucking spoke to me  no  you didn't kill him  and his eight kids  well I bit into it  and all of a sudden  it screamed  I thought my hair  was on fire
