<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a montage highlighting its controversial nature, immediately setting the tone.  The hosts then discussed their hectic schedules, including their 24/7 online presence and the constant barrage of listener interaction. They recounted a recent studio incident where a group of attractive women from Ripe TV, including Playboy Playmates and an Abercrombie & Fitch model, fled in horror after being unexpectedly exposed to graphic pornography displayed on studio monitors during an interview. Anthony detailed his single life, his Call of Duty obsession, and his erratic sleep patterns.  A caller, Dean, confessed to voyeuristically watching his neighbor shower, prompting similar anecdotes from the hosts, including a story about Anthonyâ€™s brother setting an alarm to watch a neighbor get ready.  The hosts compared their job's importance to that of police and firemen, lamenting a lack of support from their program director.  Caller Steve offered commentary on the "Tease TV" era and the women's reluctance to openly discuss sexuality on air. A discussion of a homeowner thwarting intruders with a firearm led Anthony to discuss his own large, empty house and his comfort level when armed, promoting a "Home Security Strategies" video segment featuring him.  They plugged their website, ONAradio.com, and an online contributor named Steve.  Anthony also mentioned upcoming events at his brother's restaurant. A caller questioned Anthony's lack of romantic interest in the Ripe TV women.  The conversation shifted to Anthony's ex-cat, Jack Jack, and a news story about animal cruelty, specifically a boyfriend beating his girlfriend's cats.  A discussion of the Knicks winning segued into a poorly-planned "Semi-Pro" movie screening in an unsafe location, sparking a conversation about the exploitation of young women in Times Square, which devolved into a darkly humorous hypothetical scenario about the pimp lifestyle.  The topic returned to Anthony's large house, with suggestions to fill it with "coke whores" or potheads, leading to a role-playing skit depicting his chaotic home life with numerous women, culminating in a police intervention.  The show included a "Guilty Pleasures" segment featuring callers and hosts sharing their favorite songs, including an extended discussion of a Susanna Hoffs song. A belated birthday wish for "Big Ken" was made, followed by further discussion of Anthony's dating life.  More caller "Guilty Pleasures" concluded this segment.

The next segment recapped the Ripe TV incident, playing audio of the women's distressed reactions.  The majority of this segment focused on a feud with radio host Maxwell, who mocked Opie and Anthony for their market size.  Opie and Anthony countered by listing their markets, including major cities, and played audio of Maxwell's phone screener begging listeners to stop calling after an Opie and Anthony-initiated listener attack on Maxwell's show.  They highlighted the ongoing nature of their retaliation, mocking Maxwell's perceived inauthenticity and lack of preparedness, emphasizing the overwhelming listener response to their calls to action.  The segment concluded with brainstorming various events for the recently single Anthony Cumia, including transforming his house into a residence for "wayward crack coke whores," organizing a "legal teen hot pajama party," and finding him a prom date (resulting in a response from a self-proclaimed five-year-old).  Other ideas included studio speed dating and a "Flavor of Love"-style reality show at Anthony's house.  Jim Norton and Bob Kelly were guests throughout this segment.

The following segment centered on finding Anthony Cumia a prom date, filled with sexually suggestive jokes about his appearance and dating life.  Opie and Jim Norton relentlessly teased him, referencing his video games, loneliness, and possessions.  Numerous listener calls flooded the "prom hotline," with women offering various propositions. Callers' audio quality was frequently criticized, and one voicemail predated Cumia's breakup.  Tangents included discussions of Bob Kelly's emotional state and relationships, listener suggestions for Cumia (including finding "down-on-their-luck, really hot" female roommates),  Cumia's heated bathroom tiles, promotional plugs, a "bleep game" using a peeping Tom news story, a discussion of guilty pleasures (including 2 Live Crew and ass play), a bizarre promo for "Anthony Cumia's Hot Teen Pajama Party," details of Cumia's house, voicemails from potential prom dates, Brother Wheeze's job situation, a former radio station's declining ratings, and a story about Cumia misinterpreting a restaurant placemat as a *New York Times* article. Bob Kelly was a frequent guest.

A subsequent segment featured discussions of several contests: an animation festival with a $5,000 prize, a prom date contest, and a sexually suggestive "Hot Teen Pajama Party" at Anthony Cumia's mansion.  The hosts engaged in graphic descriptions of their bowel movements and the effects of Metamucil, accompanied by a video of someone's anus.  Other tangents included Bob Kelly's weight loss, missing hats, the hosts' ages, Anthony's planned pool party (potentially a nude amputee pool party), listener calls (including one offering Anthony his 18-year-old daughter for "breeding"), and technical difficulties (a broken CD player).  A TMZ clip featuring Ellen and Heidi Klum discussing "balls" was played.  The show concluded with a sexually suggestive reading of "Once Upon a Potty," Jimmy and Eddie leaving for stand-up performances in Cleveland, and a final conversation about "Back to the Future."

The final segment discussed an upcoming animation contest, detailing plans for a large event (1200-1500 attendees) in a theater with a possible simulcast or stream, mentioning venue securing and comedians, with a prize pool of $25,000-$30,000. The submission process was outlined.  The website opiananthony.com was given for updates.  Significant banter occurred, including a running gag about Anthony's inattentiveness due to looking at images of women online.  Opie's midlife crisis was discussed, along with listener submissions for a "Line of the Day" segment featuring crude jokes. A listener's criticism of Opie's performance led to self-reflection and banter, with attempts to end the show on a positive note.  The show concluded with promotional announcements for Jim Norton's comedy shows and a final call to action for the animation contest. Bob Kelly was mentioned as being present, but no other guests were explicitly named.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shot Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shot Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shot Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shot Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Two mentally retarded women strapped with remote control explosives  where we use as unwitting suicide bombers.  Run! It is Pete Rose!  This is where entertainment is going.  You're a drunk pig and you're not sexy.  I hope you're killed by a drunk driver that isn't you. 
[00:01:00]  I hope you're killed by a drunk driver letting you suffer.  They are sick freaks!  What is the biggest piece of s*** you're involved with?  I think that's the way to go with this interview, I'm thinking.  This show.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning. 
[00:01:30]  How's everybody?  Goody good.  You're about to check out the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  That's what they call it.  Good morning.  Our phone number, 877-212-ON-A.  We got lots to talk about today, man.  Woo!  We had a wild day of radio yesterday.  Actually, you know, this show's like 24 hours a day at this point. 
[00:02:00]  We explain this from time to time.  We just do a cute little radio show for anywhere from 4 to 6 hours every day.  It's adorable.  And then, like, it takes out a life of its own after that.  Yeah.  You got the pal talk cameras and Opie and Anthony rooms going 24 hours a day.  Yeah.  You got pest attacks.  Absolutely.  We're fighting all sorts of wars out there.  Little battles going on everywhere.  We got hot chicks running out of our studio yesterday in horror. 
[00:02:30]  Horrified.  We just...  God, that had me laughing.  We got a hotline dedicated to Anthony because we're trying to find him a prom date.  Prom date.  We got so much going on.  I just never think that's going to pan out.  I'm having dinner with the enemy.  It's just all sorts of stuff going on.  A lot of crazy things going on.  Dinner with the enemy.  Well, yeah, you know.  You got a wheel and deal constantly in this business. 
[00:03:00]  Well, you do.  You never know who the hell you're going to be in bed with the next day.  No.  How's Jimmy Norton?  If I was any better, it would be a crime.  Jiminy Cricket.  And Anthony, single life treating you well or what?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  What are you kidding?  Yeah.  It's fantastic.  Any highlights?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Just don't want to talk about them?  Oh, poof.  Just lumber around a big house, echoing. 
[00:03:30]  Really?  Yeah.  I really wanted a treat last night, so I threw a Duraflame log on the fire and sat there  and played Call of Duty 4.  By yourself?  Oh, as long as I wanted.  All right.  Well.  Fantastic.  The back's all hot from the flames of the fire because you're sitting in your chair  and I'm facing the proper direction.  Yeah.  Oh, this is Anthony.  Yeah.  Yes.  Playing Call of Duty in front of the fire.  You know, it's just part of it. 
[00:04:00]  Because what else can you do on a weekday when you have to be up at all hours?  At all ungodly hours?  Uh-huh.  So, I, you know, unfortunately, I can't go out.  Weekends.  Wait, whoa, whoa.  What?  I plan out.  You're showing responsibility?  I've always shown.  Not always.  So much heck is temperature.  99% of the time, I do show responsibility with making sure I do get to bed at some hour.  Okay. 
[00:04:30]  I'll say 97%.  Okay.  Can we say 92?  Can I stay in the 90s?  Please.  50-50 shot I'll be in.  Blame it on Danny.  Oh, jeez.  No.  That answer is...  Oh, come on.  Come on.  False.  Damage.  Oh, this stupid lie detector. 
[00:05:00]  It's one of those situations where, you know, I can't...  If we were doing afternoon drive, oof, it would just be a disaster.  Oh, I know.  But I know I have to get up in the morning, which really sucks that I can't just be out  every night of the week.  Yeah.  I would be out every night, but I got to sit at home looking at the clock going, oh,  it's nine o'clock.  It's bedtime.  It just sucks.  Does afternoon scare you, too? 
[00:05:30]  It scares me for the same...  Does it?  Yeah.  Don't you know you'd just be out of effing control?  Just a disaster.  I know.  It would be horrible.  I could stay up until six in the morning.  I used to be late.  I'd get up at like 2.30 and run to any W.  Yeah.  3.05 walking.  Late to a job that starts at 3 p.m.  Wonderful responsibility.  Yeah.  So this morning thing might be keeping me in check, which is kind of good, I guess.  But it's a little boring. 
[00:06:00]  But the weekends, that's when things happen.  You can't look at it as boring because we have like the greatest quote, because you can't  even say that it's an actual job, the greatest quote jobs in America.  Yeah.  So this is like you should be excited to go to bed a little early to come play.  We get to play every day.  Yeah.  Okay.  We really do.  Yeah.  All right.  You keep telling yourself that.  I just.  You look at this as a job?  No.  I'm just talking about the other hours of the day. 
[00:06:30]  You know, when I'm at home.  Yeah.  I have fun, though.  You know, go on Pal Talk and screw around.  Look at Heine's.  Talk to people and things like that.  That's always fun.  You know, but for the.  Look at Heine's.  Yeah, of course, there's Heine's.  But for the most part, it's just kind of, you know, hanging out.  All right.  Hey, we got to go right to the phones because remember, we started our voyeuristic bit yesterday.  Yes.  Dean in Queens.  What's up? 
[00:07:00]  Hey, what's going on?  Oh, and hey, good morning.  Good morning, Dean.  What do you got?  So, I'm leaving my house this morning to go to work.  And my next door neighbor to the east, her shower faces my house.  And as I was looking, I caught a little peek.  And she's in the shower right now, guys.  Listen to him.  She's in the shower, guys.  You creep.  Dean is a ghoul.  I like Dean.  Yeah, you're getting a good view, Dean. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, yeah.  I'm definitely getting some nipple action right now.  Oh, hey.  Oh, hey.  I think that flies.  You think that flies?  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  He's just kind of looking.  All right.  Peeking around.  Are you making any homemade conditioner yet?  I know, but I'm late for work.  Good for the hair.  All right, Dean.  You have fun, okay?  All right.  All right.  There's Dean checking out a girl showering.  And by the way, I do think this is a job.  And I say it's more important than what the police do.  Yes. 
[00:08:00]  Wow.  Wow.  Or the fire department.  Yes.  So that doesn't matter.  Wow.  This is a job that matters.  Yeah.  Speaking of like peeping times and stuff, I have a brother.  Aw.  Back in the day, he's got to call in the show and tell the story.  But he lived right next to this house.  And this girl would just do everything right in front of an open window.  The bathroom was, it's an old house, so it's not frosted.  So you could see the shower, the sink, everything. 
[00:08:30]  Every morning around 6.30, this woman would get ready.  And she was really, really hot.  My brother, it got to a point, he would set his alarm because he didn't have to get up  for a job.  He would set his alarm and lay out snacks.  Just to watch.  He didn't even have to get out of bed because his bed was next to the window.  And all he had to do was kind of lean over and up slightly.  That's good.  To check out this girl every morning.  And he feels like the girl, you know, was completely aware. 
[00:09:00]  And he would just, you know, set up snacks and stuff on the windowsill.  Snacks.  And just enjoy himself.  Like he's watching a movie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's not the way to enjoy it.  He should be setting up like lube and napkins.  You don't set up honey buns.  And napkins.  Crunchy snacks.  It's just so hard to whack your bag when you're eating Fritos.  Right.  He's going to have to call the show and tell the story because he'll have you in stitches  with that one.  Max, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  I had a question for Anthony. 
[00:09:30]  Yes, sir.  You had a studio full of hot women.  How come you didn't hit on any?  Were they all too old for you?  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  Once that chick said she was 21.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's what do you.  Don't be silly, sir.  Yeah.  The icky 20s.  Don't be silly, sir.  I'm not into that whole look.  I'm not into that bleach blonde stripper looking bimbo thing.  Don't you know me by now? 
[00:10:00]  We had seven girls in studio yesterday from Ripe TV.  And they were just they're all tens.  Easily.  We had Playboy Playmates.  We had all sorts of models in the studio.  A woman that a girl that models for Abercrombie and Fitch completely naked on a horse she was  in.  I mean, these girls.  Max was like model of the year.  Yeah.  They were just ridiculously hot.  And what do you do with hot girls except look like an idiot?  So we decided that we were going to just conduct a real interview. 
[00:10:30]  But up above them on our flat screens.  On our ten flat screens that surrounded them at the time.  Yeah.  We got flat screens everywhere.  We put the most horrific porn possible.  Just take every disgusting thing that friends have shown you on the internet.  Yeah.  Every disgusting video that includes people eating awful byproducts of humanity.  Yeah.  Just horrible things.  Let's just put it this way. 
[00:11:00]  Two girls, one cup.  Very tame.  Yeah.  To the stuff we were showing these women yesterday.  Gentlemen probably that do not enjoy the company of women.  Dude.  Using certain parts of their body.  Yes.  That probably, like you said yesterday, I believe it looked like a fire hydrant was used.  Yes.  Yes.  Because it just was a mess.  And the girls were surrounded by all this visual stimulus. 
[00:11:30]  Let's just put it this way.  One of the guys that we showed, you know my cute little story about dropping marshmallows  on the fraternity house?  Cute gay.  Well, whatever you want to call it.  This guy could have done the same game using, I don't know, watermelons.  Using a Buick.  Right.  And they're just screaming bloody murder by the end of it.  Yeah.  And they all had to tap out.  And the interview ended with them running out of the studio.  Not, thanks for coming by.  Give that final plug.  Let's go, girls. 
[00:12:00]  It was just screaming like Godzilla was in the studio.  Yeah.  And then they ran out.  One girl tripped over her high heels, fell into a couch.  They couldn't get out of the studio fast enough.  We're trying to get some of the reaction shots on the radio a little later this morning.  But really, really funny stuff.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Steve in San Francisco.  Steve, what's up?  Hello.  Welcome from the time warped world of San Francisco.  Sorry we're going to lose you.  We're going to have to commit some major felonies to keep hearing you when you guys go.  Well, we're on an AM in San Francisco. 
[00:12:30]  And the PD made it perfectly clear that he basically can't wait for our contracts to end.  Yeah.  On an AM.  On an AM, right.  Yeah.  So, you know, you could get us on the internet.  How about that?  Exactly.  That sounds fantastic.  The internet is blown up with this listening thing.  Speaking of the net, man, I mean, these girls need to realize that the age of Tease TV is dead.  Yes.  Thank you.  Brilliant.  Thank you. 
[00:13:00]  Tease TV, what a great way to say it.  Look at this insight from Steve from San Francisco.  That hits it right on the head.  Tease TV.  Stop it.  And I tried nicely to ask them.  We were asking questions about their sexual preferences and stuff.  And the girls, like, didn't want to answer.  One of the girls didn't want to answer.  But it's like, do you understand?  Like, it's not really naughty to see a bunch of girls in bikini.  We don't care anymore.  Right.  No.  If she wants to talk about some experiences and make it a little titillating for the listeners,  that's cool.  But they all clam up. 
[00:13:30]  And they think, yeah, just sitting there and talking about how they go on TV in a bikini  or something is going to do something.  Who cares?  Right on.  All right.  Very good.  Very good point, Steve.  Ooh.  If we had a prize closet like Ron and Fez did here, yeah, we'd give him something.  But we don't have crap.  Wait, no, no.  Keep him on hold.  Keep him on hold.  Ooh.  For what?  Nice.  Nothing.  Yeah.  Just leave him there suffering.  Just keep him on hold.  You want a copy of Happy Endings, my book, sir?  I'll send one.  Oh.  Yeah.  You bet I do.  Okay. 
[00:14:00]  We work in a world where they have program directors that just flip a switch and just expect magic every  day without, without helping us whatsoever.  Like we remember the days, like it was a no brainer to have, I don't know, a prize closet.  Yeah.  Like really good stuff to give away on the air.  And you would be given a list of things so that if something happens, you could just  grab the list and go, okay, let me go down there.  Sir, that was a great call.  Yeah.  You contributed to the show. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Made a great point.  Yeah.  How about we give you this?  Yeah.  Where is that?  We don't have that.  We don't have that.  We pretty much don't have any tools.  No, there's plenty of tools around here.  We're just counting on our talent to make this whole thing happen.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Which makes it a hell of a lot harder.  How long is that illusion going to last?  No kidding.  Should I roll the dice and possibly wreck a good call?  Oh, boy.  Oh, wow.  He wants to risk it all.  All right.  Hold on.  Risk it all.  Hold on.  Oh, this is great. 
[00:15:00]  Hold on.  Roll the dice.  I like this guy.  He's going to roll the dice.  He had a great call.  He could have hung up.  Everyone would have went, Steve from San Francisco.  He did a great job.  I think Steve is already rolling the dice because he lives in San Francisco.  Yeah.  I think he's unprotected sex for Steve every night.  Right, Steve?  Here we go.  Wow.  The audience.  She's really a girl, man.  What are they saying in it?  Half the battle is trying to make sure she's really a girl.  Yeah, I believe it.  We're getting things here saying punch out, Maverick. 
[00:15:30]  Believe.  Like the audience is going, no, no, don't do it.  They enjoyed your call so much.  Let them do it.  But let them do it.  Rolling the dice.  Rolling the dice.  Steve is McMurphy trying to lift that sink.  Yeah, here we go.  Here we go.  Here's the reason why Snoop Dogg wouldn't do the rap with Larry King.  He realized when Larry King started spreading the news that that's a notorious B.I.G. song. 
[00:16:00]  And it was an East Coast, West Coast thing.  His boys would never let him live it down if he had rapped along with Larry.  Oh, really?  Hmm.  Okay.  Okay.  I wouldn't say that.  That doesn't overshadow your earlier point.  Yet it isn't bad enough to where you've ruined it.  He's just...  Let's say his role, it worked out for him.  Just a fact.  Man, I had this ready.  God, I wanted to use that.  I'm sure the next caller will give you an opportunity. 
[00:16:30]  Yes, please.  Keep that sound right in front of you.  Hey, Steve, we like you, man.  Call back.  Steve from San Francisco.  Don't hang up on him, though.  Just let Travis get him.  It's too late.  I hung up on him.  Oh, call back.  Travis get his stuff.  So if you want a free book from Jimmy, just make believe you're Steve from San Francisco  at this point.  God, fucking God.  Johnny from Long Island.  What's up?  Johnny.  Morning, gentlemen.  Hey.  I just wanted to talk to Anthony.  We got another win for homeowners with big guns.  You hear about the home invasion this morning?  Yes, I was listening to the news on the way in. 
[00:17:00]  I didn't hear many details, but I did hear in Elmont, I believe, there was a home invasion.  A home invasion.  And it said, well, these home invaders were turned away by a gun-owning homeowner.  They were greeted by the barrel of a gun.  They weren't sure if anybody was injured.  That's what I heard.  I guess the story was so new.  But the guy didn't get invaded. 
[00:17:30]  He didn't get robbed.  He didn't get beaten.  He had a gun.  Good.  Good for him.  Very nice.  Anyone know any details on that?  I'd love to know what happened.  Well, they said it was the second time that they had targeted his house, so he was almost  the minute he heard a noise, he knew he had to get up.  Is that true?  No.  Because now, let me tell you something.  My house.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  It's very big.  And very lonely.  And very empty.  Very lonely.  At this point. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  I wouldn't go as far as to say lonely.  But it's big and empty.  Ooh.  It's just...  No, I'm not...  I'm just saying...  Another piece to the puzzle, might be.  No, I...  I'm in communication constantly.  Mm-hmm.  So it's not like I'm lonely in the house, but it's a big house, and it makes noises, which  many times were attributed to Little Jack Jack.  You remember Little Jack Jack?  Yeah.  I barely do. 
[00:18:30]  Little faces, white little mittens.  We almost found something you could actually love.  Almost.  It came close.  Yeah.  Then, um...  Now I hear a noise, and I'm just like, oh, what the hell was that?  What was that?  And I peer over at my guns, and I know I'm safe.  Whether it's just a squirrel on the roof, or something else trying to get in the front  door.  I'm an armed citizen. 
[00:19:00]  We understand that.  Yes.  We're trying to get your guns away from you.  No!  Until we can stabilize you.  No.  Stabilize me.  I'm fine.  Well, why don't we go to break with Anthony's home invasion tips?  I love this little thing.  Good call, Iraq.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Opie and Anthony.  Home invasions are a serious matter.  That's why your local law enforcement decided to put this video together.  Home security strategies with Anthony Cumia will instruct you on how to protect your loved 
[00:19:30]  ones, and more importantly, your valuables.  This week's episode is...  Defending a Single Point Entry.  Opie and Anthony.  How are ya?  Hello.  Hello.  Hello, hello, hello, hello.  Let's not forget about ONAradio.com.  They're doing a good job with that.  Yes.  See?  I could be positive.  See? 
[00:20:00]  ONAradio.com.  What, Jimmy?  ONAradio.com is really well done.  They're doing a great job with it.  The way the videos are lined up and the animations, it's just, it's all Opie and F's and stuff.  I don't go on the websites that much.  Can you please mention the rundown?  Because next time I see Steve at FH, he's going to be like, whoa.  That's actually the weak link.  Yeah.  I'm kidding, Steve.  I think you do a great job.  I love Steve.  Steven S. from Bayshore and his rundown.  Yeah, he does.  He does.  Very funny.  It's a complete overview of the show.  Well, he barely talks about the show at this point, but he makes some funny jokes and stuff. 
[00:20:30]  His writing's terrific.  I don't know what he's actually listening to every morning, but, you know, he's still fun to read.  He's right here.  I'm watching him call you an effer.  My brother came up with a brand new t-shirt for St. Paddy's Day.  Uh-oh.  I don't know where he could get it.  Maybe you go to Brother Elmo in MySpace.  Will they print the N-word on a t-shirt?  No.  He does call us McOpie and McAnthony for St. Paddy's Day. 
[00:21:00]  A little racy.  And then I think we're doing a lot of stuff at FH for the holiday.  Oh.  I think we're doing stuff on the 9th and the 15th at FH Riley's, my brother's restaurant, 400 New York Avenue, in the heart of Huntington Village.  As Tom Chiasana comes out of retirement to just look at you, say, oh, you want to pay me money for that?  Retirement.  Or whatever it was.  Or whatever it was.  Maybe I can help.  You're out, Tom.  You're out, Tom.  Sorry, Tom.  Sorry, Tom is right. 
[00:21:30]  Zach S. from Jersey, he writes,  Has anyone drawn the comparison between newly single Ant and Daniel Day-Lewis at the end of There Will Be Blood?  You know, just a crazy old guy alone in his cavernous mansion taking hot shots at bowling pins and ceramic bric-a-brac.  I'm not like that.  It's kind of similar.  Enjoying myself.  And then you got Scott from Hot Pog.  Little known fact about Jack Jack, Anthony's cat.  Yeah.  Well.  And my ex-cat.  Not anymore your cat. 
[00:22:00]  It's the ex.  Yeah.  He was terrified for every second he was near Anthony, that loon.  That isn't true.  Jack Jack used to come up on my shoulder on the Paltor camera and people would go,  Aw, Jack Jack.  Little Jack Jack.  And did you just go?  No, I liked it.  I'd scratch him under his chin.  I'd go, shook-a-shook-a-shook.  Really?  Shook-a-shook.  We got a cat story in the news today.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, boy.  This is a good one.  Would someone barbecue one or something? 
[00:22:30]  Well, boyfriend.  Horrid thing.  Boyfriend decides to beat up his girlfriend's cats.  Beat them up?  Yeah.  How do you beat up a cat?  I know you could, like, kick a dog in the liver and that'll kill him in time, but you  can't really beat up a cat.  Yeah.  Don't want to elaborate on that, Ovi?  No.  I don't know what you're talking about.  No.  No clue.  No clue.  She's looking down from heaven, and she knows now what happened.  Chester told her.  Hey, a little known fact about me.  I love animals.  You can do it.  I'm just allergic to them. 
[00:23:00]  You love animals until they eat your prime rib during a basketball game.  Hey, man.  It was the Knicks in the playoffs.  Of course.  You know how rare that is?  Here in New York, this is for Boston, by the way.  Judy's watching us.  Judy's watching us.  What is that?  She's looking down.  It's like God is watching.  Oh, okay.  From a distance.  All right.  She knows now.  Do you know if there is some kind of an afterlife or a heaven or whatever that people that pass 
[00:23:30]  on can look down at people, she now goes, oh, my God.  Ovi killed Chester.  I killed Chester.  I think it did.  He died of liver cancer, the little dog.  All right.  But you had given him a swift kick to the liver.  Well, I don't know about that.  Well, maybe.  I don't know either.  It might be the old Ovi.  Maybe.  The old angry Ovi.  Right.  One for the Celtics fans because we're on in Boston, of course, on BCN. 
[00:24:00]  Yes.  They're bragging down here today because the Knicks beat the Bobcats last night.  Yeah.  What is this?  I know we don't do a lot of sports, but wow, they're excited here in New York City because  the Knicks beat the Bobcats.  And you might be asking, who are the Bobcats?  Pretty much the worst team in the NBA.  Yeah.  I mean, the Knicks are right there, but I think the Bobcats, I don't even really keep track  of that closely because, and I'm a huge basketball fan, but, you know, the Knicks just blow. 
[00:24:30]  But the sports guy is very excited because they pretty much blew out the Bobcats last  night.  Isn't the team full of, like, replacements and second, third string guys and just horrible  players?  Yeah, I think Will Farrell is playing for the Bobcats.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah, to promote Semi-Pro, you know.  Will Farrell, who's promoting Semi-Pro everywhere but the Opie and Anthony show.  And we sat in a goddamn prison room. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  In the prison rec room.  Well, no.  It was a gangster theater for gang members.  We learned that yesterday.  This fine station in New York did a screening for Semi-Pro, sent Ant and I into harm's way.  This movie theater right near Port Authority, they welcomed the homeless, the gang members,  the drug addicts, some prostitutes that were a little cold.  And that's who we saw Semi-Pro with the other day.  Yeah, that was great.  True story.  We were scared.  I was scared.  I rarely get scared.  I was scared of this movie theater. 
[00:25:30]  And I get an email from Roland last night.  Oh, this is great.  Roland's out of his mind, by the way.  Roland goes, I heard you guys were trashing me.  Yeah.  I called him back.  I'm like, are you insane?  I was trashing the radio station for setting up this screening.  But I think people got confused because Roland sets up a lot of nice screenings for us in  really, really nice screening rooms where the seats are twice as big and twice as comfortable.  And they only allow like 50 people in this room.  The screen is right there.  It's perfect.  And that's what we thought we were going to the other day. 
[00:26:00]  But no, it was this scary theater outside Times Square.  Times Square, safe.  Outskirts of Times Square, not safe still.  Yeah.  Especially near the Port Authority where like all the young women from all over the country  come in from their little bus ride hoping to make it in New York.  And instead, you know, there's a pimp waiting for them.  I'm from Missouri and I know I can make it as a Broadway actress here in New York.  So all I got is this suitcase and get in the car, bitch.  Yeah.  You hungry? 
[00:26:30]  You hungry?  If you want to be entertained, just kind of find a safe place outside the Port Authority  and just watch.  It's amazing what goes on right there, right at their front doors.  Young, fresh-faced country girls getting taken advantage of.  Oh, yeah.  Within a week.  A week.  They're just put out on the street.  Well, first, the guy's got to kind of brainwash her.  Yeah.  You know, I've seen the movies.  I've seen the after school special.  You got to tell the young thing that, yeah, you're going to kill their entire family.  First you pull up.  No, no, no.  You got to pull up first. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  And then you go, hey, you know, what's going on?  You look lonely.  Right.  Oh, I'm on a bus.  I just came out from Missouri or some, you know, Midwestern state or something.  And then you go, oh, you look hungry because they probably don't have much money and they  are hungry.  Yeah.  I'll take you to eat.  So you take them somewhere to eat and you talk.  Like a McDonald's.  Yeah.  No, no.  A classy joint like that.  It can't be a real good place, but it can't be just fast food.  It's got to be like a Friday, something they can relate to from home, something like 
[00:27:30]  that.  And then you just talk to them about how, you know, the city's a tough place.  And if she wants to make it as an actress, I know a lot of people, blah, blah, blah.  And then you've got to kind of build up that relationship.  And then you just start punching her in the face for some reason, because that's what  happens on the Lifetime movie.  And she doesn't leave.  And tell her, you know, you're going to have to pay for this meal.  Right.  But I don't have any money.  It's after a few days, you say you got to pay for everything, because then you get  her like some clothes and things like that. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  But I don't have any money.  Well.  Well, there's other ways to pay off your debt.  Did you honestly think I was just doing this out of the kindness of my heart?  I need money, too.  Right.  Well, there's a way you can do this.  I got to set you up.  It's a slap, but then an apology.  That's how it starts.  A quick slap.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Oh, is that?  Just get her used to the beatings.  Oh, you know something?  You're going to have to pay for that.  But I don't have...  Oh!  Oh! 
[00:28:30]  Oh!  Oh!  I don't have any money!  Oh!  Well, you're going to have to work it off.  So long, Broadway.  Yeah.  So long.  By the way, this is what takes place in my house now on a daily basis.  So long, Broadway.  Hello, 168th Street.  I'm turning up prostitutes.  Well, you got to set up that home.  We've been telling you, you got to set up the home.  The home for wayward coke whores?  Right.  People saying it's very similar to what Ozone used to do back in the day. 
[00:29:00]  I truly don't remember that Ozone bit.  So if some people think I'm kind of hoo-hoo-hooing Ozone, I apologize.  But Anthony's got this very large, empty house on Long Island.  And we're thinking he's got to fill it up with, like, coke whores.  Wayward girls, coke whores.  Yeah.  I'm still not in agreement with the coke whore thing.  I think you'd need potheads.  No, potheads.  They're going to be a little more quiet.  The music's going to be a little trippy at times that you're going to hear in their bedrooms.  But they're going to be a little mellow. 
[00:29:30]  Pot is readily available.  A girl can go out to a bar.  Yeah, but mansions aren't, dummy.  Yeah, but coke.  Give them a nice room in your mansion, and you've got the pot, and everything's good.  I still think.  You keep them subdued until you need them.  You ever see a coke whore that hasn't had coke?  Holy Jesus, Palomino.  They will do anything for a little coke.  Yeah, I've got to be honest.  Pot doesn't motivate girls.  Pot isn't a motivator.  It's not a motivator.  If a girl doesn't have pot, she'll just be like, all right, give me a beer. 
[00:30:00]  But, see, you lack responsibility, and when you've got to really be paying attention to  these girls that are living in your house now.  They will steal everything you have to to get coke, so you've got to be attentive.  So if you're not timing out the distribution of the coke properly, they're meds, as I like  to call them.  Right.  You're going to see stuff leaving your fine house.  Yeah.  So you've got to be paying attention, and you don't have it in you to pay attention.  You might be right there. 
[00:30:30]  Okay, I could see that.  You know.  That could be a problem.  Oh, here we go.  With the firecrackers going on, is that going to be me?  Yeah.  Yeah, this is Anthony's.  And whores just sprawled out on the couch.  Yeah.  Me going by with a mirror.  Make sure they, like, make sure they pass out every once in a while on your front lawn  just to show the neighborhood who's in charge.  These neighbors aren't very tolerant of my lifestyle. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  So, uh.  Some good scenes where the police have to show up.  Yeah.  Like a coke or a girl just screaming bloody nose on the balcony.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Get in the house, bitch.  By the way, by, uh, we're being reminded our old pal Ozone had a home for runaway lesbians.  Oh.  They had to be lesbians.  That's different.  A little different.  A little different.  That's, uh.  Motor it! 
[00:31:30]  All right.  Get off the, get off the balcony.  People are going to see it.  The neighbors are going to see you.  All right.  Now we're screwed.  Everyone in the house.  Everyone in the basement.  Everyone in the basement.  Everyone in the root cellar.  Oh.  Get in the basement, dummy.  You ever, ever go out on that balcony again.  And I swear to God.  All right.  It's going to get sorry.  Anthony. 
[00:32:00]  Anthony.  Yeah.  Wake up.  No.  It's.  No.  Stop.  Stop pushing those horrific buttons.  What's the matter?  Calm down.  Take a deep breath.  We're enjoying a guilty pleasure right now.  Is that what it is?  What's your guilty pleasure?  Give us a call.  All right.  Do you have a guilty pleasure, Jimmy?  You, uh.  Sister Christian is my guilty pleasure.  It's on my iPod.  You want to go out on the porch?  Oh.  Back to the bit.  Yeah.  It's right there.  All right.  Go ahead.  Go out.  I'll be right behind you. 
[00:32:30]  There you go.  Now lay there.  I thought you were, uh.  I thought you had a big hole in your backyard for a pool.  What's that about?  What is.  What the.  What is.  It is.  Coke wars and a brand new pool.  I don't think those go together, by the way.  Oh.  Yeah.  Do a couple of Shatners.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Can I get back to my guilty pleasure?  Oh, yes. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  This is the part that really gets me, man.  The hair on the back of my neck stands up.  Oh.  Back to the bit.  What are you.  Huh?  What are you doing?  Firing off some shots.  Why?  Ah.  Keeps them in line.  Yeah.  And the neighbors.  Yeah.  Is this anyone else's guilty pleasure? 
[00:33:30]  Jimmy, what's your guilty pleasure?  Rocky Road.  Rocky Road is your guilty pleasure?  The ice cream.  Oh, the ice cream.  Tee hee.  Tee hee.  Anthony, what's your guilty pleasure?  Guilty pleasure?  Yeah.  Ooh.  It's guilty pleasure Thursday.  I like the bangles manic Monday.  Oh, my God.  That part is he done. 
[00:34:00]  Hey, good.  Oh, we're not allowed to say that, right?  We better be able to say that.  We just yell it out.  It wasn't even in any context.  All right, good.  Except an accurate one.  Leave that in.  Manic Monday is a good song.  I can't even argue with you.  Yeah, you like that one.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's talk to the NYPD.  Oh, yeah.  Pete, turn off the music.  Turn off the music, everybody.  NYPD.  Turn down the stereo.  Shut up, man.  Cheese it.  The cops.  Dude, chill, man.  Just sit there. 
[00:34:30]  You hit your stash, right?  Be cool.  Be cool, man.  Don't be paranoid.  He doesn't know.  He doesn't know.  Ten and two.  Hi, officer.  Hi, sir.  What happened?  Hello.  Hi.  Hi, officer.  Hi, sir.  Why are you calling the show today?  You know what happens when you hire crummy security?  You end up at the Port Authority watching movies.  Oh, that was somebody taking a little jab.  Oh, at Kenny.  At Kenny, who was our security that day, perhaps.  What? 
[00:35:00]  When you hire a lousy security, you end up at a movie theater by Port Authority.  But Kenny didn't make that decision.  No.  Kenny had nothing to do with that.  Sir.  Actually, they didn't even want us to bring Kenny with us.  Kenny was the one who stepped up and did research and went, I need to go with you guys.  This is not a safe place.  Wow, man.  That guy just wrecked our bit.  And Will Ferrell going everywhere to promote.  This is what publicists have to understand.  He's going on a local news show today or tomorrow. 
[00:35:30]  There's more people that listen to the show than watch that.  Way more.  Way more.  Yes, yes, yes.  Way more.  You dumb, dumb publicists.  Yes.  Oh, God.  Let's say hi to Sean in North Carolina.  North Carolina, for some reason, loves this radio show.  What's up, Sean?  How we doing, gentlemen?  Pretty good.  Very good.  Good, good.  Anthony, I think you're on the right track with the coke heads because with the pot heads,  lazy, unmotivated, munchies all the time. 
[00:36:00]  Do you really want a house full of V-Rocks?  Ooh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  We thought we were going to get through the first hour without a fat joke.  Plus, it gives you a cotton mouth, too, and you never want that.  Like, all right, go ahead.  Just pop it in your mouth.  I got no spit.  It's like this.  So you hear.  Yeah, fruit roll-up noise.  I know.  When they're talking, it's just like, well, I.  Could you drink something? 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, there's just that dry mouth sound.  Yeah.  The roof of the mouth and the tongue sticking together with, like, smelly spittle that's  tasty.  Elmer glue.  Elmer's glue.  It's like yummy.  Hey, Mark in Pennsylvania.  Mark.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  What's up, Mark?  I make cotton mouth noises.  Hey.  Oh, sir.  I just want to know what you're going to do when you come home and all your little cold  cores get into your little wetlands.  Weapon stash you have and have a little drug war going on. 
[00:37:00]  They're all dead laying on the floor.  One survivor, bloodied but wanting more coke.  Well, I really think that's what you should do.  You've got a huge house.  Winner takes all.  You don't really want to get married, so fill it up with some broads.  Do, like, a Hugh Hefner thing.  Yeah.  With your own twist.  Yeah.  So I could just come home and.  Where do you find them, though, like that?  Huh?  Where do you find them, though?  Like, we come home and they'll just be like, oh, hi.  And, you know, take your coat.  Poor authority.  Poor authority. 
[00:37:30]  The movie theater we've just been.  Okay.  Look, I don't want to put racial lines on this thing, but I do want white girls.  Maybe one.  You should do a teen sleepover party.  I got it.  Really?  A legal teen sleepover party at Anthony's.  Illegal teen sleepover party?  No, a legal.  Oh.  A legal.  A legal teen sleepover party at Anthony's with Pal Talk cameras everywhere.  Oh, big camera thing?  Oh, yeah.  Naked camera thing. 
[00:38:00]  Teen sleepover party.  Yeah.  We got a lot of things going on with you.  We got the prom date thing that's going very well.  Extremely well.  Is it?  Oh, Mark, before we let you go, what's your guilty pleasure?  I need to know.  Oh, man.  I don't know.  I had to think about that one.  Oh, no, you don't.  You got one in your head.  We all have a guilty pleasure.  It comes on the radio.  You make sure your windows are rolled up, but you turn it up a little louder.  I'll tell you one of my guilty pleasures as far as music goes. 
[00:38:30]  Ray of light.  Madonna.  Thank you.  What you said before.  Musically, you know my guilty pleasures?  Here's the safety dance by Men Without Hats.  You can dance if you want to.  That's right.  Leave your friends behind.  Right.  But why would you?  All right, Mark.  His pants would be down for no reason.  Here's a taste of Anthony's guilty pleasure.  Oh.  And he's dead serious, Bob. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, love it.  Isn't it nice?  Yeah.  This is Anthony's guilty pleasure.  What was her name?  Susanna Hoff.  Yeah, you're a Hoffman.  She was kind of cute.  Oh, there's one line in this song that is god-awful. 
[00:39:30]  Where she's talking about her boyfriend, and he goes, come on, honey, let's go make some  noise.  Like that, let's go have sex talk.  Oh, right.  Right, right.  Let's go make some noise.  Like a yell of him.  Yay.  This plays at my house all the time.  It's another man ate money.  Oh.  Ah.  All right.  Nice.  Enough of that.  Hey, I'm a dope.  I got to wish him a belated birthday to one of the Philly crew, Big Ken. 
[00:40:00]  It's Big Ken's belated birthday?  It was yesterday, and I'm marrying his daughter, and I don't even wish him a happy birthday on  the radio, and the guy loves the radio show.  You lose the dad points.  I lost a few points.  You lose the dad points when you do that.  But he was too busy with his Wii anyway, so he's very happy.  Is he big into the Wii?  He was playing with his Wii for his birthday.  Okay.  Big Ken and his Wii.  What's his favorite Wii game?  Wii bowling?  I think he...  Or Wii baseball?  I actually think they were doing Wii bowling. 
[00:40:30]  Does he have a little character made with that big head that looks like him a little bit?  I don't know.  We were very jealous because they were calling...  What is it called?  It's a me.  A me?  With, you know, M-I-I.  Yeah.  For your W-I-I.  We called down to Philly very jealous because they were having a Wii party for Big Ken's birthday.  They were all playing with the Wii.  Why am I making the 100 jokes?  I don't know.  About my future father-in-law. 
[00:41:00]  Jesus.  Oh, Wii.  Stop with the Wii.  Happy birthday to Big Ken.  Man, we forgot about you yesterday, and that's not cool whatsoever.  Not cool.  Not cool.  That's fine.  No, I never...  I forget everyone's birthday.  The chick is the only one you got to remember.  You're not your guy.  You're not supposed to remember birthdays.  Well, um...  Your girlfriend's birthday, she'll remind you.  That's the way I remember.  My girlfriend starts hinting around,  Yeah, it's my birthday.  Is it...  The girls I like don't know their father's birthday either.  That's pretty much it. 
[00:41:30]  They didn't have fathers.  Been gone for years.  Good.  Anthony's a big fan of the girl that doesn't have a father.  Right.  In the picture.  Like those.  I love that.  A little younger, they look up to me,  and they realize I'm not what they were looking for,  long after they've been destroyed.  After they've done everything sexually that I wanted them to do.  You're not what I was hoping for.  Yeah, well...  A little, uh...  Tough noogies.  A year and a half.  Tough noogies.  Wow.  I wanted something I didn't get years ago. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, well.  Oh, my God.  We got people calling with their guilty pleasures.  We got, like, tough truck drivers calling in.  Want to hear Don the trucker?  Don, what's up?  My guilty pleasure.  Tears for fears.  Everybody wants to rule the world.  See?  There you go.  That's his guilty pleasure.  Guilty pleasure.  Oh, boy.  This is going to be a hit on the message boards tonight.  So, what's your guilty pleasure?  Still think they were better at any W, though. 
[00:42:30]  But we'll still take your guilty pleasure here at our site.  Let's go to John in California.  John.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Anything by Pat Benatar, pretty much.  Ugh.  Love is a battlefield.  I like the video version where she goes, leave me alone.  Yeah.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Oh, shut up.  All right.  We're going to work on the sleepover at Anthony's house. 
[00:43:00]  We're working on a prom date for Anthony.  Look what we're doing for you, buddy.  Yeah.  Ray Westchester, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Okay.  I wouldn't admit this if I was in front of you, but Fly to the Angels by Slaughter.  I used to love that song.  Did you?  Yes.  What?  Sing it.  Mark Slaughter, right?  Mark Slaughter is a really, really cool guy.  A talented guy, too.  I think he's doing, like, animation now.  Cartoon voices.  Or cartoon voices, is it?  I used to love this dumb song.  Thank you, Ray.  Better. 
[00:43:30]  A little Fly to the Angels as we take a break here.  Ah.  We'll go to the hook here.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Have the smile.  Look at the light up the wall.  Phone number 877-212-O-N-A.  Now it rains.  It seems the sun never shines.  I'm a brilliant broadcaster.  And I'll try to slow to slowly, lonely road. 
[00:44:00]  Ooh, I got this feeling.  This private's got to be in a vice.  They have to be in a vice.  You've got to fly.  That's who they hate us.  Heaven awaits your hearts.  And flowers bloom in your name.  Yeah.  Whoa, whoa.  Rock.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:44:30]  Everybody look at your hearts.  We can dance.  We can dance.  Everybody take the chance.  Let's see if the dance.  Oh, let's see if the dance.  Jimmy's guilty pleasure.  What do you think, Jimmy?  Oh, I just want to get up and move around, but I'm too embarrassed.  You've got to do the safety dance.  I do.  You make a big S with your hands.  No, I never liked that part.  No?  Whatever.  You didn't like that?  Oh, here it is.  A C, a U. 
[00:45:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Guilty pleasure's coming in from all over the place.  You got Kevin in Buffalo.  His guilty pleasure is Desperado.  Steve from PA, Supertramp.  Supertramp, man.  Very underrated band.  I'm going to see what Supertramp's song this guy likes.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Yeah, I love a Supertramp logical song.  Guilty pleasure.  Ooh, logical song.  Nice.  Very, very nice. 
[00:45:30]  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Kevin is rest in peace off Xtreme's third album.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God, man.  What's wrong with you?  Xtreme.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I think they had one or two songs, right?  Well, they had the two really kind of mellow ones that everybody liked, and then they bought  the album and realized that none of the other songs will like that on the album.  And by the way, I mean me.  You're talking for everyone.  Yes.  Okay, we got lots to do.  We never played the cat thing, because we went off on a tangent. 
[00:46:00]  Also, we're going to get a report from the Pests.  Yes.  In just a little while.  I guess they just destroyed Maxwell yesterday in Cleveland.  Completely destroyed Maxwell.  And we'll get a full update in a little while, all right?  But first, we got a cat story.  Boyfriend beats up girlfriend's cat.  How do you beat up a cat?  Like, you could abuse a cat.  You could be cruel to a cat.  But beating up a cat sounds like it actually tried to put up a fight also. 
[00:46:30]  Like, it got up and was duking it out with you.  And put on tiny little boxing gloves.  Yeah.  All right.  Want a piece of me?  Oh, you want a piece of me?  Her cats are her babies.  But for some reason, police say Sarah Sable's boyfriend savagely beat them within inches  of their lives.  I can't even imagine what they went through.  How frightened and how afraid they were.  When arrested, 24-year-old David Wrigley told police he was trying to get the cat to  lack of them and lost his temper when they would have come out from under the bed, telling 
[00:47:00]  them, quote, I did hit, squeeze, and throw the cats.  Just because they won company.  The cats were obviously scared of the dude because they're hiding under the bed in the  back there.  Oh, damn.  He's punching back.  I'm kicking this cat's ass.  Whoa.  I got him now.  I got him on the ropes.  Oh, he's roped by doping.  Oh, man.  Am I kicking?  Shut up. 
[00:47:30]  And punt.  Yeah.  And punt.  Of course.  Simple.  Hello.  Exactly.  Yes.  This is obviously horrific, but there's no fun in just talking about how horrific this  is.  No.  The fun is in having a little fight on the air with a little kitty.  See, he was actually fighting the cat.  Yeah.  Is what he was doing.  And scene.  It all happened while Sable was at work, eight-year-old Madeline taking the brunt of  the abuse.  We put on oxygen and she just laid there, you know. 
[00:48:00]  She was scared.  Sadly, Madeline passed.  Jinx is recovering from several broken ribs.  Jinx.  Wigley was released on his own recognizance after being charged with aggravated cruelty to  animals.  If convicted on the animal cruelty charges, Wigley could serve two years upstate prison  time.  Wow.  Two years.  What are you in for?  I beat up a cat.  That's pretty bad.  Especially when you go into jail if you have a black eye and like a broken arm.  You could not go quietly.  You got cat scratch fever as you're in the joint. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, it's this little red mark.  It gets red.  It itches.  Yeah.  It itches.  As you just get to get it in the shower.  Let him face charges because these two cats have been through so much and they don't deserve  that.  Sable is now just trying to nurse Jinx back to health.  Jinx is a very loving, friendly cat who loves people, but ever since he came home from the  hospital on Monday, he hasn't come out from underneath the bed.  Would you?  Has to take him out so he'll eat.  She hopes he'll recover in the first place. 
[00:49:00]  Not coming out from under the bed.  The cat learned nothing.  Get out.  Another beating coming up.  Time to learn a lesson.  Why?  Why wouldn't this?  Get out from under the bed.  Why wouldn't this broad just take the cats and leave?  Or at least I will destroy.  I will ruin you.  I'll wreck you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, I will end you.  Right.  That's out of his mind.  That was funny.  Yelling at his cat.  Oh, we got another guilty.  Pleasure coming in. 
[00:49:30]  Hold on a minute.  You shouldn't beat up your cats.  Oh, boy.  People.  Okay.  Hold on.  You can dance if you want to.  Let's go.  They had a lot of big songs, man.  Let's go.  Oh, Men Without Hats?  Yeah.  They had that.  They had that other safety dance one.  I got the same one twice.  Okay.  Sorry.  We're both wrong.  We'll have to agree to agree.  We'll have to suck.  And then they had the one song that sounded like safety dance, sort of.  Yeah.  It was the sequel to it?  Yeah.  Okay.  Let's say hi to Mark in Binghamton. 
[00:50:00]  Binghamton, New York.  Also known as Bingo Town.  What's up, Mark?  Hey, ONA and Jimmy.  First time caller.  Welcome aboard.  Well, I've been a listener for a long time.  I don't care.  All right.  Thank you.  Well, yeah.  It's a pleasure here.  Yeah.  That Hillary Clinton song.  One, two, three, four, five, six, two thousand.  Wisconsin, Ohio.  Texas, but on to Penn State.  She's going to do it.  What, lose?  It's just a chance she'll make it. 
[00:50:30]  Any life feeling she'll break it.  Give that bitch some bread, she'll bake it.  I'll not be your president.  Hillary Clinton.  Nothing's going to turn her back now.  Straight ahead and on the track now.  With plans to make our dreams come true.  Yeah.  What's she going to do?  Hillary Clinton.  There is nothing she can do.  Except win and satisfy a man sexually. 
[00:51:00]  There's no stopping her.  Oh, no time for chance.  You're going to do it.  On your mark, get set and vote now.  Got a dream and lots of know-how.  With plans to make our dreams come true.  Dreams are going to be coming true because of her.  Looking for us all day.  Yes, all day.  Make all our dreams come true.  That's what she's doing all day.  Not paying attention to what her husband is spewing on. 
[00:51:30]  That answer is false.  Aw.  Aw.  Aw.  Damn.  Throw me with your mouth.  The paper had a terrific cartoon that featured Hillary today.  It was basically Hillary and Obama in a foot race. 
[00:52:00]  And the finish line is right there, Jimmy.  And Obama is way ahead.  And the caption says, Hillary can still win by a nose.  But see what the funny part of the cartoon was?  Yeah.  Hillary's nose was about 10 feet long.  Oh, because she's lying?  Was it like a Pinocchio joke?  Ooh.  Oh, God.  She can still win by a nose.  That's funny stuff.  That Hillary song.  You know how it makes me feel?  You know that feeling you get when you're walking across your living room and you're constipated  and you're not sure if you're going to make it? 
[00:52:30]  And you're stiff leg walking.  Your thighs hurt?  Yeah.  It looks like you have perfect posture because if you bend in any way, shape, or form, there's  going to be a major problem on the linoleum.  That's the feeling I get from that song.  Oh, look at Bill trying not to unravel on television.  It's so funny watching him just try to talk now without snapping.  Oh, I know.  They must have told him, like, you can't be so confrontational with every question you're  asked.  Anyone else notice that Bill Clinton needs a haircut badly and he's starting to look like  your grandma when she... 
[00:53:00]  I'm in the Afro-war.  She looks like most people's grandmas just before they go to the parlor to get their  hair done.  It's a little long and stuff, but it's going to be all shaped up nice at the parlor.  He doesn't care.  He desperately needs a haircut.  Sonny Ferelli, what's up?  BCN, Boston.  What's happening?  Hey, man.  Hey, does it mean you're gay if your guilty pleasure is actually Abba's dancing queen?  Is that yours?  Well, he had great harmonies.  I actually have it on my iPod.  What a loser I am.  iPod. 
[00:53:30]  I owe you 50 bucks still, Sonny.  Sorry.  Yeah, you too.  I'm not a Welsh.  Sorry.  You're a Welsh.  You're a Welsh.  You're a Welsh.  What do you think?  No, I'm not Welsh either.  I'm not a Welsh.  I'm just being accurate.  I'm no Brit.  You can load up my account with 50 bucks, you know.  Shut up.  We're not even listening to you, Sonny.  Yes.  You.  I love this fucking...  Hey, Sonny, enjoy the abuse on the message boards.  Yeah, really.  By the way, a lot of people are very confused by my message. 
[00:54:00]  I love the fans.  Yeah, of course.  I just love effing with them, too.  There you go, Sonny.  You're so great, man.  Sonny's guilty pleasure is Dancing Queen.  That's wonderful.  All right, so yesterday on the show, I think this was worth replaying.  We got a clip.  So we get these seven really hot girls in from Ripe TV.  I mean, just smoking hot.  We had two, I believe, Playboy Playmates.  We had a girl that pretty much was naked in the Abercrombie and Fitch ads, you know, covering  up the naughty parts, but she was naked on a horse. 
[00:54:30]  We had the stars of MTV shows, just really, really hot.  Maxim's Girl the Year or something like that.  And so we bring them in yesterday late in the show, and we don't know what we're going  to do with hot broads.  They don't really have much to add to a radio show.  It's nice to look at, smell beautiful.  You know, you wonder if you have a chance with them.  But besides that, it just makes awful radio.  So we decided we're going to do an interview about this Ripe TV thing, and we're going to  just play horrific porn above their heads on these flat screens. 
[00:55:00]  Now, and as they're looking at us, we also have flat screens that they could see.  Yeah.  But ours are on MSNBC, CNN, Fox News, looking like we're responsible broadcasters just keeping  up to date with the world news.  Yeah.  Their screens, however, had just horrific porn.  And I mean horrific.  I mean, if you've seen Two Girls, One Cup, that's easy.  That's an easy view compared to what we were showing these girls.  It's an easy watch.  Let's just put it this way.  We started with meat spin, and it got ugly from there.  And so here's a clip. 
[00:55:30]  As we're just trying to do an interview, and they finally start realizing that there's  horrific porn above their heads.  They don't ask you about it on your bio and all in the magazine?  It's not about, like, sex stuff.  What do they ask you about?  And your data sheet?  Oh, my God.  Excuse me, you guys.  I can't handle this.  Let's see.  I'm going to haul.  I'm seriously getting nauseous.  What are you talking about?  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  God.  Artie Lange is hungry.  That's what it looked like.  You okay? 
[00:56:00]  What?  We're supposed to go eat right after this.  I am.  These questions are not...  I kind of like it.  Don't talk about it.  Why don't we...  These questions are not that bad.  So that was the beginning when they started realizing.  And then this is how the...  I think this is how the interview ended, with them fleeing the studio.  Not the nice wrap-it-up-in-a-bow type of ending to an interview that most guys get.  No, not the thanks for coming. 
[00:56:30]  Thanks for coming.  Let's hear the final plug.  Blah, blah, blah.  No, they get this.  The porn was getting...  This is where...  We can't even really say it.  But...  Well, it just got horrific.  The porn is dying.  I know.  I can't even look at it.  It's the most disturbing thing ever.  They are killing me right now.  In my 33 years of life, I've never seen that awful.  It's taboo.  How do we stop having all this large sex?  Like, can't we go back to our show?  The Ripe 7.  The handler's begging us to stop this. 
[00:57:00]  The hot girls, 7 girls.  I can't take this anymore.  I can't.  What's the matter?  The handler's begging us to stop this.  We're going to just take over.  Check us out on Ripe 7.  Ripe 7.  Ripe 7.  The spray.  TV.  TV.  Check us out.  On a band.  On Time Warner.  Don't regret it.  Come play with us.  These guys, I think we're done playing with them.  These guys are dirty. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, boy.  I don't know.  Have you been watching any screens?  Boy, what are you doing?  What the hell is so funny?  Oh, my God.  Seriously, you guys are crazy.  We're done.  We're out.  Peace out.  Ripe TV.com.  Check us out this spring.  What?  What?  Oh, jeez. 
[00:58:00]  They're fleeing the interview.  They're fleeing the interview.  Back live.  They just were horrified.  Oh, jeez.  My jaw's getting tight listening to that dummy just plug.  Ripe TV.  Ripe TV.  Yeah.  Contribute nothing.  And then just keep yelling, Ripe TV.  Like we care about that.  Dope.  Just listening to that.  I was grinding my teeth listening to her.  Really?  Dude, that was annoying me so.  You know what?  We're done playing with these guys.  Ripe TV.  Go to Ripe TV.  Go Ripe TV.  Watch me in a bikini. 
[00:58:30]  Tee-hee-hee.  That's really saucy.  Can't get that on the internet.  A girl in a bikini.  Where do I go for that?  Is it free?  You're kidding.  You mean she'll say something sassy?  Could be.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Very, very funny, man.  Extremely funny.  Bikini jumping little things that were sexy in 1985.  Let's say hi to Josh in Cleveland. 
[00:59:00]  Good morning, Cleveland.  How are you?  Well, B and Anthony.  The most awesome radio show.  Just ask the folks in Auburn, Maine.  Market to me.  And what is that supposed to mean?  We're stoked to be on the air in Market to me.  Woo!  Woo!  Huh?  I don't know. 
[00:59:30]  I guess they got us.  What was that?  What was that, Sam?  Maybe you could explain for everybody here.  What?  Well.  You mean me?  On Maxwell's show yesterday.  Yeah.  He pointed out that all the markets that you're in, for the most part, are smaller than Cleveland.  I didn't account for the fact that if you add them up, that's bigger than Cleveland.  But he said they're smaller than Cleveland.  And then I brought in some audio that I found because he, in his spontaneity, was able to predict what a promo might sound like in Market 280 where you guys are in. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Very clever.  That's good.  But we're on, in the number one radio market.  Yeah, see, it's kind of hard to goof on some of the other markets we're in.  Yeah, we're in some small markets.  We're in about 20 to 30 of them.  And if you're just in that market, that would really suck.  That would really suck.  But when you're in, oh, market number one in the country.  Let me see here. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, God.  Is he grabbing at straws, you fat little man?  This Maxwell douche is a loser.  He's on one station.  And if you're a radio guy, you want to be on more than one station.  And he's making fun of us because he picked out one small market and made a promo out of it.  Yeah.  Here's just some of the stations we're on.  We're on in New York City.  That's kind of a small market, I guess.  I guess he's right there.  We're on in Boston.  We're on in Cleveland.  We're on in Rochester, New York.  We're on in San Francisco.  We're on in Providence, Rhode Island.  We're on in Grand Rapids.  We're on in Albuquerque, New Mexico. 
[01:01:00]  We're on in Buffalo.  We're on in Baton Rouge.  We're on in Tucson, Arizona.  We're on in Flint, Michigan.  I guess he's got us there.  Flint is the big get, by the way.  We're on in Syracuse.  And you know what?  We don't even list the main station and other small stations that we're on on the main list.  Yeah.  So what are you getting at, dude?  Yeah.  You're on one station.  I just named how many?  Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen stations.  And this list is bigger than this that I have in front of me. 
[01:01:30]  And we're on where you are on.  So, like, we're on in Cleveland.  That's where you are on and only on.  All right.  So what we do is we can't find anything to really...  So we're on in Cleveland.  He's on in Cleveland.  We're on a better day part than he is.  So he even loses the Cleveland battle as far as radio guys go.  But let's just make believe it's a wash.  Cleveland takes out Cleveland.  Yeah.  We still have all these other markets that you're not in, douchebag.  And then how about you just put the number one market in the country on there, New York City. 
[01:02:00]  Right.  I heard the pest just destroyed him yesterday.  Ruined him.  Where the phone screener was begging for the pest to stop.  Oh, by the way, when we do these little attacks, you think it's a cute little thing that's going to last a day, maybe two days.  Wrong!  It goes on and on.  It gets uglier and uglier.  You got the pests that are digging for all sorts of information.  Have fun, fat boy.  Because Benjamin Bornstein, he's just a phony, he'll never put any of those callers through. 
[01:02:30]  No.  He won't.  All right.  Because he sucks.  He'd sooner walk off his show.  He couldn't have left his show.  Did he really leave his show early?  Yeah, he left his show an hour early, I'm hearing.  Because he's on some kind of webcam and all of a sudden, like you see him leave the studio and then it's just a microphone on the webcam when he still has an hour of his show left.  And he had this to say about the pest, oh, this is just going to rile him up a little bit more.  And they do a cattle call, like a cattle call, apparently, begging their army, the ONA army, and one car shows up. 
[01:03:00]  You can actually look at the picture, it's on the website.  Check that out.  You'll be thoroughly impressed.  One car.  Great big radio show.  Call them and bother them.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, I've taken them a lot.  Email.  Email them.  Really?  Do you know how many emails I took today from their listeners? 
[01:03:30]  Three.  See, this is Rocco crappy.  Oh, he's such a liar.  He just lies through his teeth and, you know, there's no accountability.  And that's why we have absolutely no respect for you.  Oh, no.  He didn't say that.  And the radio business will have no respect for you in the end, you liar.  Dude, you don't know what you just did.  So what?  Oh, God.  So you're claiming that only you got three emails, and your listeners were supposed to  believe that.  One car showed up where you broadcast.  We didn't tell people.  We didn't have an all-out attack to where you broadcast yet, you idiot.  The bottom line is this. 
[01:04:00]  He's lying, and people know he's lying, and everyone else at the station should be made  to know that he's lying.  Yeah.  The phone screener said, please, we are not built to take this volume of calls.  Please just stop calling.  He's not going to put you on.  Yeah, they were saying that.  The screener was begging Benjamin, stop lying, to have the people stop calling.  Stop lying, Ben.  You're not going to put them on your show, Rockstar.  You know it.  Wow.  It's the fat little man who is sitting there and lying to his listeners. 
[01:04:30]  Three emails, huh?  Yeah, three.  Oh, boy.  In the history of this program, when we've said to attack a show or go to their emails  or phone lines, it's never been three.  Believe me.  It goes on and on.  I'm sure.  Maybe you only got to three because you were so excited by the pictures they were sending  you of nude men, because I'm sure our listeners sent you pictures upon pictures of nude men. 
[01:05:00]  So you got through three and just couldn't take it anymore.  You had to stop at three and finish up.  Three.  I didn't take any of my personal account.  Three, dude.  Three.  From an entire country.  From the greatest radio show on the planet.  That's so good.  Planet.  Planet.  Planet.  Planet.  Not funny.  Planet.  Three.  Who talks like that?  Planet.  This douche. 
[01:05:30]  Planet.  Let's talk to Stacy in North Carolina.  Stacy, what's up?  Morning, my-my-my-boys.  Hey, sir.  Hey, buddy.  Between my brother and I, we were listening yesterday, I know we sent him at least 100  emails.  Yeah.  And that's from one-  That's one guy.  Two people, right.  And you know what?  Hold on one second, buddy.  Hold on.  1-800-348-1007.  216-578-1007.  And here are emails. 
[01:06:00]  Apparently, they didn't get any emails.  So, and I'm not saying send anything negative.  Maybe you're a fan of the show and you want to let him know you're a fan of the show.  It's Max at WMMS.com and Stans at WMMS.com.  S-T-A-N-S.  Yeah.  No, M-S.  Yes, N-S.  Huh?  He goes on at like three o'clock, right?  Yeah.  I started calling at like maybe 2.30 or so.  We know the truth.  The phone screener, we have some audio we're trying to cut up and play, but the phone screener 
[01:06:30]  basically was like, please stop.  We cannot handle this.  And as far as an honest radio show goes, man, he wouldn't put anyone through.  You know, that's a great way to handle it.  So ignore what's going on right in front of your fat boy eyes.  You were calling, dude.  What was the guy doing?  I couldn't get through.  Like the phone, I guess it was completely jammed or something because I called probably at  least 30 times in between three and say 4.30 or five. 
[01:07:00]  And it was a solid busy signal.  Thanks.  Excellent.  That's all I got, boys.  Punch it out.  That's all our fans.  I mean, they call the Maxwell show because they're fans.  They like fat pigs named Benjamin who talk in a phony voice.  Yeah.  And then listen to this.  And Norton's so funny, too.  He'll bag on Cleveland, but he'll come here and take all your sucker's money for going  to his...  Bag on Cleveland.  First of all, if I just stopped at Norton's funny, I would have appreciated that.  Hey, just isolate that clip. 
[01:07:30]  Norton's funny.  Norton's funny.  We'll just keep playing it and lie like he does.  Do me a favor, Bornstein.  I know you're a liar and you're a radio hack, but I would bag on Cleveland in a second, but  I didn't because I like Cleveland.  I've always said the women in Cleveland are great because they have, let's just say, private  parts that I appreciate the appearance of and they put out.  So I said that I have two sold out shows in your city.  Yeah.  But look at him trying to rally the troops.  Hey, you suckers. 
[01:08:00]  That's the best you got.  Nah, nah.  He's going to come to Cleveland and you suckers, you're going to give me your money?  Does he think that people are going to go, hey, wait a minute, he's saying that Jimmy  doesn't like us and we're giving him money?  Well, I won't be going to see Jimmy.  What is it?  Who are you, Norma Ray trying to rally the troops?  Yeah.  Shut your mouth.  Great.  Money for going to his comedy show.  Right.  Shows.  Does that make you feel good?  Sold out.  The guy loves ragging on your town, but now you're going to drive downtown, go to the House 
[01:08:30]  of Blues and pay money to see him.  Thank you.  He plugged him.  Thank you, stupid.  You even know where I'm playing, don't you, Benjamin?  Good boy.  When did this guy start doing radio?  Last week?  Oh, he's a good boy.  This guy is as green as they come.  Is he the worst?  He's going to convince people that have been fans of this show even before we were here.  Yeah.  You know, we've been huge in Cleveland for quite a while, and he's going to try to convince 
[01:09:00]  them that, first of all, we rag on the city, that Jimmy rags on the city of Cleveland, and  that there's suckers for seeing you.  I'm actually embarrassed for you.  I know.  It is embarrassing now.  Why does it always reach the point where you start going like, oh, this guy doesn't  really get how this works.  This guy doesn't really get it.  You can hear in his voice how frustrated he is.  Just going for the local angle, like, what are you guys doing supporting it now?  That's what he's basically, he can't deny the fact that somebody from New York is coming 
[01:09:30]  to Cleveland with two soul.  He can't deny that.  That's just because the show is popular.  Yeah.  So he has to combat it by going, you guys are suckers, you're giving him your money because  he rags.  Shut up, Maxwell.  Well, that's what radio is attempting to do.  They're trying to say that local radio is God.  You know, the reality is most local radio blows, blows.  And most people don't care if an entertaining show is from another state, another city,  as long as they're being entertained as they go to work.  And that's what we do.  That's what we're doing for Cleveland and many, many other cities across America. 
[01:10:00]  And you could see Jimmy and myself.  What?  Yes, I am going with Jimmy.  Oh, God.  I want to go so bad.  I swear to God, I want to go so bad, but we're celebrating Big Ken's birthday in Philly.  I'm dying to get on a plane with you guys.  And the beauty is I've convinced Anthony to pay for my ticket.  Because Anthony only flies in the front of the plane.  I'm the coach kid. 
[01:10:30]  You're not the coach kid.  I am going there, not coming back.  I won't fly first to Cleveland.  It's too expensive for too short a flight.  Come on.  You're really going to Cleveland, eh?  Splurge.  Easy come, easy go, nothing.  You're really going to Cleveland?  Yeah, I'm going to Cleveland.  And you guys are going to be on Nord's show tomorrow afternoon?  I think so, yeah.  Are you going to be there in time to get on the radio there?  I don't know.  You better.  I hope so.  You better.  Why should I better?  Because it'll be too much fun, man.  You know how much fun you guys are going to have in Cleveland?  Now you're going to drive downtown, go to the House of Blues, and pay money to see him? 
[01:11:00]  Good boy.  Have fun with all that.  In the town he hates.  Yeah.  In the town he hates.  In the town he hates.  How does that come into play?  Holy Jesus.  Holy Jesus, is this guy an ass?  But it's just, if I hated Cleveland, believe it, I trashed Albany before I went up there  because I don't draw well in Albany.  I would tell you I hated Cleveland.  Dude, I've admitted trannies.  You think I'm going to lie about Cleveland?  Yeah.  I happen to like Cleveland.  I've always said that.  Sold out.  Just a little, stop.  You're not meant to do this, Benjamin. 
[01:11:30]  You're not, you're a little fat mama boy.  That's what you're meant to do.  Eat some kugel, Benjamin.  Show up.  Show up.  And see how much these, I'm not going to make these stupid idle threats like you do.  Punch him in the face.  Punch him in the face.  Just show up and see how the fans react to Jimmy on stage.  And you tell me if they look like they're being bamboozled out of their money or they're  having a damn good time.  You are a tool. 
[01:12:00]  This has become the hottest ticket in Cleveland.  It really has.  Oh, yeah.  I think there are people going to just show up at the House of Blues even if they don't  have a ticket at this point.  Oh.  And breaking news, Anthony's going up there with Jimmy.  That's right.  Good.  And I messaged the fat boy, Maxwell.  Let's see what kind of radio you really could do.  And then why don't you have a whole show taking actual phone calls?  Because you know it's happening.  It's right in front of you.  Stop being a phony.  Stop faking it.  And take some phone calls.  And let's see what you got.  What kind of chops you got. 
[01:12:30]  Unscreen.  Take unscreened phone calls.  Even screened ones because they'll get through.  We took one a year.  Just take some calls.  We took one of your losers and they weren't even brave enough to come on the air with  their voice.  They had to play some promo that I guess you ran on your show yesterday.  It was probably someone.  And now look.  We riffed on it for 20 minutes.  We riffed on it for 20 minutes.  What do you got, fat boy?  You're going to just ignore it.  It's going on right in front of you.  Ignore your phone lines.  Tell your screener to beg.  Beg the people that are calling to stop because we can't do the show. 
[01:13:00]  By the way, the attack that we did yesterday was cute, but let's go, fellas.  Step it up.  Step it up, Pess.  Step it up.  Full bore.  This guy is douche number one.  Douche number one.  And he started the whole thing.  I can't wait for the day that we get the bigwigs from Clear Channel to actually call and go,  guys, please.  Please.  And then we're going to have to tell the bigwigs at Clear Channel, well, tell your little  fat boy, Maxwell, that he has to go on the air.  Come on, Bornstein.  Come on.  And admit defeat.  And if he doesn't, it will continue. 
[01:13:30]  Come to the show.  It will continue.  He hates.  Got it.  And we can do the set for you real quick.  Stupid.  Dummy.  Hey.  Burn victim.  Stupid.  Stupid.  Done.  Exit stage right.  Forgot pedophilia.  I forgot the, I wish I was Robert Kelly.  I could be if I looked like you.  I wish I was Robert Kelly.  What does that mean?  It's just who, he's. 
[01:14:00]  What does that mean?  I don't know.  Oh, God.  But it's another player on our show that he knows.  Right.  That's the beauty.  You know, the show that he says he doesn't know much about.  That he doesn't know, but he knows Robert Kelly comes on here.  He knows, he just knows everything about this show.  Oh, is this guy a douche?  Max, Benjamin, you're not good at this.  Yeah.  You're not, you're not, you're not a maverick.  I actually feel sorry for Rover because he's going to have to work with this douche.  Oh, my God.  They're going to have to make believe they're friends and stuff.  Are they going to have to pass in a hall and like talk? 
[01:14:30]  Rover has to hate this guy's guts.  He does.  I don't know how he's going to play it.  We'll see.  Whatever.  In a city that he hates.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bamboos are people taking their money.  A city.  What?  What?  A city that we hate so much that Anthony, who doesn't like leaving his house.  Yeah.  I don't get any.  I don't go anywhere.  He's now going to tomorrow with Jimmy.  Hopping on a plane and going.  What do you got, Sam? 
[01:15:00]  Just so you guys know, Maxwell also said he knows that you listen to his whole show.  And that's how you get his audio because how else would you get it?  How else would you get it?  Our fans send it in.  They go, you got to hear this jackass, Sam.  Yeah.  What do we tell you to do every day?  Go through Maxwell's podcast.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Listen for a...  As I'm wheeling and dealing with, like, real people on radio, you ass.  Well, Sam was just reporting.  You don't have to talk to another.  The phone's lit. 
[01:15:30]  Well, okay.  You know, you heard him.  He said that the pest didn't do a good job.  He only got three emails and one person showed up where he broadcasts.  You know, more just lies from just another loser in radio.  He knows he is.  Just a loser that wishes he had the career we have.  Dude, once you start attacking, like, the content of comedy, which is what he does, like,  because he's an unfunny guy.  That's not funny.  And then he starts, I don't like your hometown.  Like, Jesus, dude.  That's your idea of a funny comeback?  Why are you going to give me your money at the House of Blues? 
[01:16:00]  He don't like Clevelanders.  Yeah.  Hello.  He ain't a Browns fan.  Hi, House of Blues.  I want a refund.  Bornstein told me Jimmy doesn't like me.  I want a refund for my ticket.  I'm not going to be taken.  He doesn't like Cleveland.  That's what Bornstein said.  Take your New York money and go back to New York, bub.  Ew.  That's like your aunt insulting somebody for you. 
[01:16:30]  He doesn't like your town.  Why would you go and watch him?  Yeah.  Oh, what a loser.  Benjamin, you're like my fat aunt.  Loser.  Stop trying to be edgy and funny and be what you are, which is just a local hack with a local  hack voice.  And so no one is confused.  We're doing this because this is just extremely fun for us.  Oh, it's a blast.  That's why we're bothering you.  We're not scared of you.  I don't like being insulted.  And when somebody trashes me, I will never get tired of trashing him. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  Never.  And this is how much we hate Cleveland.  We brought our Traveling Virus comedy show there.  When we announced that we were going back on the radio, XM Satellite Radio at the time,  we had to choose what cities we wanted to go to to promote the whole thing.  And we knew we were huge in Cleveland.  We had a great relationship with Cleveland.  So guess what?  Cleveland was one of the stops.  And we only, I think, did six cities out of about 30 that we were on at the time. 
[01:17:30]  And Cleveland was one of the ones we chose.  We get Cleveland.  Trust me.  And maybe, look, I don't want to say anything bad about the rest of that radio station.  Maybe some of the fans that we have are friends with people that work in that station.  And maybe you know some of the salespeople there, the general manager, the program director.  Maybe you want to call them and be, you know, be a gentleman, of course.  Yeah.  But maybe you know people that work in that station and you want to straighten this whole mess out.  So you don't just have to deal with him.  Yeah.  Have fun, fat boy.  Have fun.  Yep. 
[01:18:00]  Enjoy.  Have fun.  Let's see what you can take.  Because yesterday was cute, but now watch what happens.  And it's the type of thing these guys don't let off, let up on whatsoever.  And everyone that we've ever done this to, everyone has gone behind the scenes to some management boss, anything, to make phone calls, to threaten with lawyers.  They've always done this.  Right.  This has never worked in the favor of the person that we send these morons that listen to this show after. 
[01:18:30]  They're relentless.  And I know.  You called it an army because it's cute to call it an army.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because act shows have armies.  Right.  Well, we have a concept that no one else has.  It's called PES.  They're insane.  We hate them.  They just won't let up.  No.  We absolutely hate what they're capable of doing.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Mm-hmm.  Enjoy.  I just think this now concludes the abuse that is fat boy Maxwell. 
[01:19:00]  And if PES have any audio, by the way, of Benjamin Bornstein's people that you're talking to,  if you have audio, please send it in.  Yeah.  I do think it'd be very funny to listen to it.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Until he starts crying to his boss and makes them make us stop playing the audio.  We would, you could play any audio you want of us on your show.  Go ahead.  Do it.  But guaranteed, you will cry to your boss.  We know how this plays out.  It's textbook.  You'll start crying to your boss.  He'll cry to the lawyers. 
[01:19:30]  They'll cry to our lawyers.  It'll all go behind the scenes.  And make them stop.  We can't do a show.  The phone calls.  It's not funny.  It's not funny.  Oh, God.  We have a way of disrupting business.  It's terrific.  You're a douche.  It's terrific.  It's absolutely terrific.  Oh, I love it.  I love it.  Look, the emails are out there.  I'm looking at PalTalk right now.  All I'm seeing is the emails scrolling by, people taking note.  But I'm betting that there's other email addresses they have.  These are the...  Oh, yeah. 
[01:20:00]  They'll find them, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Oh, they will.  Just keep it at that.  Dude.  Keep it at that.  Just put...  Just...  I want to make an announcement because, like, their bosses will talk to Anthony and I.  We can't control the PES.  Nope.  We set this in motion years ago.  We cannot control them.  They don't listen to us.  If we say stop, they don't even listen at that point.  You don't think they're going to find an email address?  I just saw his home address scroll by on PalTalk.  I swear to you.  His home address, in a matter of minutes, just scrolled by on my computer. 
[01:20:30]  It's amazing what these people know, the information they can get.  This is how I...  This is why I don't bother with these creepy pests.  One of them, one time, was like, dude, I just want you to know there's infos out there.  And he gave me my mortgage information.  I know.  It's horrible.  I'm like...  But he wasn't being a dick.  He was just like, you know...  Yeah.  I don't care.  One guy sent me a big Google map with a pin and flag on my house.  Like, oh, okay.  Right?  He knows where I live.  I feel bad for Rover. 
[01:21:00]  You have to deal with that hacky crap.  All right.  Hey, good morning, Cleveland.  Jimmy and Anthony going to your town tomorrow.  Absolutely.  Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, we're kind of doing Guilty Pleasure Thursday.  Someone on the staff.  This is their Guilty Pleasure.  Wow.  I don't even know the song.  We're back with Opie and Anthony, by the way.  It's got to be E-Rock.  Miley Cyrus, see you again? 
[01:21:30]  That's Hannah Montana.  This is someone's real Guilty Pleasure?  So it's either Steve, Sam, Travis, Roland, Danny, or E-Rock.  E-Rock likes Paul Abdul.  Danny's like at the death metal.  Roland.  Roland?  No?  Who do you think this is?  Whose Guilty Pleasure is this?  I would say that this is Steve's Guilty Pleasure.  That's probably the coolest song he likes. 
[01:22:00]  That's the most masculine song on his iPod.  By the way, that shirt he has on.  What shirt does he have on?  Where do you dry your shirts on?  Mercury?  It literally stops at his belt.  It's repulsive.  He's got a short, tight, awful shirt.  Hey, whose Guilty Pleasure was that?  Sam.  Sam's Guilty Pleasure?  Sam?  Oh, okay.  That makes sense.  Yeah. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  No, come on, Sam.  What?  Come on.  Sam.  You like that?  You turn it up?  I do.  Sounds like the old stupid Barbie song.  No, it doesn't.  I'm a Barbie gal.  It's a very popular song.  Is this?  Yeah.  With who?  I never heard that.  It's all over Z100 and all the hit stations on XM.  Oh, my God.  Well, why don't you go work on Z100 then?  Exactly, Sam.  Just plug, you know, another station. 
[01:23:00]  No problem.  Instead of the show you work on and the station that you work.  I picture everyone going, what?  They play that?  Well, so long, I hope it happened.  I got to tune in Z100.  Who does the morning show over there?  I have no idea.  That's how bad we are.  Elvis Duran.  Is it Elvis?  Okay.  I know the name.  I swear to God, I didn't know who did mornings over there.  I don't know.  I know some of the morning shows.  A lot of the cabbies listen to them.  I get in the cab because it's before our show starts.  Right.  There's a phony phone call playing.  I root for my own car to crash every morning. 
[01:23:30]  He doesn't even like me.  You know who?  You know what show the cabbies listen to?  This one?  Yeah.  Well, they're not in the cab because it's before.  They love talk shows.  They love talk shows and a lot of cabbies.  I get recognized in a lot of cabs by people that shouldn't be recognizing me, if you know  what I mean.  Maybe they have plans.  I'm like, because they still have the station on here in New York after our broadcast.  And so I'll ask a few questions here and there every once in a while. 
[01:24:00]  And then the ones that don't recognize me will start talking about the show.  And then that gets awkward because you don't know if they're going to start trashing the  show.  All right.  Hey, Anthony's prom date thing.  Yeah.  Now, we got a couple things going on with Anthony.  We're trying to set up his giant house on Long Island into some kind of wayward home for  wayward crack coke whores, I think, was the thing we need.  So far, we don't know what to do with that. 
[01:24:30]  We're also planning a legal teen hot pajama party for Anthony.  A pajama party?  And I'm dead serious about that one.  At the house.  We want pal talk cameras all over the place.  You can get security.  What about my neighbors?  Screw your neighbors.  They hate you already.  What difference is it going to make?  Yeah, but they could call the police.  That's why we go with the legal angle, my friend.  It might look like risky business.  A scene from risky business.  Because you're an Italian and a Nazi. 
[01:25:00]  What is there to like about you?  Right.  Let's get the 18 and 19-year-olds interested in some kind of hot pajama party at your house.  A pajama party?  I'm serious about that one.  And then you got the pal talk cameras.  It'll be one of the biggest things ever on the internet.  I'm thinking this could be huge for you.  Yeah?  Yeah, absolutely.  I think that'll be a big...  Absolutely.  Hmm.  And then we're really having a problem finding you a prom date.  Yeah.  I got something here.  What do you got?  It says, I want to be your prom date. 
[01:25:30]  Blah, blah, blah.  Nice writing here.  I want to be your prom date.  I think I meet the criteria you're looking for to have a good time.  My father's a big fan of the show.  Okay.  While I have little sexual experience, I'm willing to try anything.  And then it goes with a bunch of examples that I can't say here.  Whatever your pleasure.  See, it's working.  Let me see. 
[01:26:00]  It's working.  I enjoy simple pleasures of life, but playful fun in fresh snow to snuggling on the couch  and watching some tunes.  I would say I have a slim, youthful, and athletic physique.  And then it gets bad.  I'm 39 inches tall and weigh 38 pounds.  And here's the picture.  All right.  Why is somebody sending me?  Oh, wow.  It's a picture of probably a five-year-old in a little Halloween costume. 
[01:26:30]  But the hardest part of reading this was the fact that somebody's parent actually had to do this.  An adult actually did that.  Hey.  See, I don't see the prom thing working out.  Well, I don't know.  Tim updated the promo because now we're getting a little desperate because it's not working out like Jimmy and I were hoping.  Well, you are going to a prom.  It is prom season.  You are single.  Let's take advantage of that, Anthony.  Yeah.  Get on board with this promotion. 
[01:27:00]  Jimmy was brilliant in describing what we want to happen.  Perhaps a bit too brilliant.  He was absolutely brilliant because I don't think there's going to be any takers.  But we already, you know, we're bending a little bit.  But the girls still have to put out.  That's the only thing we ask.  We're bending with the rules, but you do have to put out if Anthony takes you to the prom.  Uh-huh.  Here's the updated promo.  I'm Anthony Cumia and I approve this message.  Will you go to prom with me?  Hey, it's Opie from the Opie and Anthony Show.  By now, you probably know that Anthony is single. 
[01:27:30]  Anthony Cumia.  Bonafide celebrity.  He broke up with his girl right around prom season.  Do you need a prom date?  You can shake your booty down on the dog.  I think Anthony wants to go to a prom.  And if you're lucky, after the prom, Anthony will give you something that rhymes with dog.  Bring Anthony to your prom.  866-FU-LINE-1.  866-FU-LINE-1.  You can be Anthony's prom date.  Anthony wants to go to a prom.  Call now, 866-FU-LINE-1 to have the prom night of your life.  Now I gotta cut loose, cut loose. 
[01:28:00]  You can't stop the sudden.  You know what's great about radio production?  Hold on.  It's over?  The production makes it sound like you really want to go to a prom.  Yeah.  And we're trying to push you into this whole bit.  Well, I think that's obvious.  Huh?  I think that's obvious.  But the production makes it sound different.  Yeah, it certainly does.  Yeah.  I don't care.  Do we have any takers?  Travis, how many phone calls for Anthony?  Oh, I'm just sure.  How many potential prom dates? 
[01:28:30]  Zero?  Not funny.  Zero, zero?  Not funny.  Yeah, real funny going to prom with someone on the race.  Real funny.  Real funny.  You know, I have kids and I don't appreciate the shut up.  Why?  When he goes to your school, he hates your school.  He hates it.  Yeah, that's going to work.  Maybe if you were doing college radio, you dope.  Oh, I know.  Hometown pride.  Shut up, Max.  Let's go to Randy in Virginia.  Randy.  The funny thing is, he's not even from Cleveland.  He's in Florida. 
[01:29:00]  He's not even a hometown boy.  Wasn't he like a whipping boy for Bubba or something?  He did something for Bubba.  He's not.  Bubba hated him.  Really?  Bubba got him fired?  Nice.  You know, I actually, believe it or not, I don't like the guy, but I applaud Bubba.  The guy kind of ripped off his voice and stuff, and Bubba got him fired.  That's good.  Randy, Virginia, what's up?  Yeah.  Is it me, or has Opie turned into the Vince Vaughn character from old school?  He's putting single Anthony into all this stuff.  Well, I see this as a very good opportunity for Anthony. 
[01:29:30]  I mean, I've been with Anthony for a dozen.  Got to be a dozen.  Too many years.  Too many, yes.  Too many years.  Let's be honest with each other.  But besides that, it's around 94, 95, 13, 14 years of fine radio.  Yes.  Let's not count the time that we didn't get to do radio.  Right.  He's dopes.  And in that time, for that entire time, Anthony was either married or with his girl that he 
[01:30:00]  just broke up with, for the most part.  For the most part.  For the most part.  Yeah.  This is a rare opportunity.  You're single for the first time in 10 years of marriage, and how long was this relationship?  Oh, a while.  A while.  You just want to say a while.  I get it.  It was just a while.  A while.  More than five years.  Right.  What's wrong here?  Nothing's wrong.  What's wrong? 
[01:30:30]  It's just, you put me in very awkward positions, because I never talk like this on the air.  I'm not, you know, usually very close to the vest kind of, just, you know, I'm not used  to talking about certain things.  It's fair to say that this single thing is not something that you're used to, for the  most part.  Uh, for the most part.  All right.  For the most part.  Let's say, yes.  So, I want you to take full advantage of this.  Exactly.  I want you to go.  Correctamundo.  I want you to go to a prom. 
[01:31:00]  I want you to set up that big house with, like, loose women.  Right.  And I, what else?  Oh, and the teen hot pajama party.  Hot pajama party.  No grandma pajamas.  They got to be hot pajamas.  Uh-huh.  And at this point, yeah, I am Vince Vaughn.  I want the listeners to help me out here.  What else can we get Anthony into here?  What else can we get him into?  Get him coupons for the bunny ranch?  No, I will not be seeing any prostitutes. 
[01:31:30]  Why not?  Because I've never seen a prostitute in my life, and I'm not starting now.  That's for sure.  Dude has a goof.  I know.  Think risky business.  All of a sudden, way out there in the suburbs, you get a knock on your door.  It's risky business, all right.  You get your throat cut with a razor blade, or you get the AIDS.  No one's looking.  The girl has a few extra parts.  Just go, no.  Girl has a few extra parts, but no one's looking.  Yeah.  Front door right there, my friend.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:32:00]  Invite this thing in.  You really think I want a tranny?  It's not, and it's not gay because you're doing it as a goof.  No, there's no trannies.  Why?  I won't be seeing a tranny.  I won't be getting a prostitute.  Because it's not something I've wanted to do ever.  All right, prom date.  Prom date, though, you're in.  Prom date?  Teen hot pajama part, you're in.  I know prom date's not going to happen because the restrictions that are put on, the obligations 
[01:32:30]  that are put on the contestants are a bit much.  They've got to be almost legal.  They've got fake IDs.  Who's looking?  No, it's not even that.  It's what they're supposed to be doing during this prom.  What?  This is just awful.  And when are you going to divide your house in half with walls and stuff?  For the wayward women?  Well, I have my east and west wings.  Right.  You've got to get a big wall.  No, no.  I think I'll just get one of those invisible fences and set it up and put shock collars on them. 
[01:33:00]  Right.  So if they ever try to cross over into my side of the house, they will get shocked with the shock collar.  Speed dating with Anthony.  Yeah!  Next week on the O.B.  Anthony Show.  Wait a minute.  What are you talking about?  Thank you, Travis.  I'm supposed to go to one of those speed dating things where you sit down and talk for a minute  or three minutes, is it?  You don't like leaving your house unless you go to Cleveland to see Jimmy. 
[01:33:30]  But we're going to do speed dating in the studio next week.  What?  All sorts of single women.  Fat women.  Black women.  Underage women.  Cougars.  Why do you say fat women and black women?  I want a cornucopia.  Cornucopia.  Of women in the studio.  Interesting choice of words.  Why?  Because you know I'm not much of a melting pot kind of guy.  I understand that.  Sounds more like a slob medley.  And you'll go around the room and you're going to do a little speed dating next week. 
[01:34:00]  That's what we do for you next week.  Why would I want to do that?  Because you've got to explore a little bit.  My life.  Let your freak flag fly.  It's been very personal over the course of my radio career.  I understand that.  Aside from after the fact.  I understand that.  Then things kind of ooze out.  Right.  But I don't think I'm the public kind of run in and speed date on the air kind of a guy.  Hey man.  I'm just trying to help a brother out. 
[01:34:30]  You're really helping a brother out.  All right.  I'm helping a brother out.  Here's what you do.  Yeah.  Come on Jimmy.  All right.  Here's your speed dating.  You sit down and it takes this much time.  Millionaire.  And then you pick who you want.  Yeah.  That's how it works.  Is that how it works?  They try to take, you know what I do?  Millionaire.  Let me see without a bra.  Not bad.  You made it to round two.  Is that it?  You got to be harsh.  That is fast.  That would be speed dating.  How about another example coming?  Another what? 
[01:35:00]  Another idea.  Sorry.  Jordan.  I'm very excited here.  He says that you should be doing like a flavor of love show.  A flavor of love show where I guess there's girls that show up in my house.  And then I make a grand entrance every day.  Yes.  And do something.  They have to do events.  Yes.  And then I kick one out of the house.  Would you at least do speed dating?  Why would I want to do that?  I've seen specials on speed dating and it looks ridiculous.  What kind of things do they do on his reality show?  Like, you know, the girls to make it to the next round. 
[01:35:30]  You have to find Warsaw on the map.  Find Warsaw.  Warsaw.  I want to see you field strip and clean an AR-15 in under three minutes.  All right.  We got to take another break to catch up because we went really long.  Dan is completely paralyzed.  Oh, he's out of his mind.  We got Bob Kelly.  He's holding up the break sign during breaks.  He wants us to take commercial breaks during the commercial break.  Yeah.  We got the guy that Jim Norton is very jealous of.  Bob Kelly.  Yeah, come on.  Joining the show next.  Nat Vanny. 
[01:36:00]  Can I make an announcement, too?  What is that about?  Chicago is sold out, so tomorrow morning.  But you're not a good comedian, Jimmy.  No, I know.  That's the beauty of it.  It's so weird.  I know the city I hate.  This is kind of weird.  Friday, April 25th.  Tickets go on sale tomorrow morning.  10 a.m.  Ticketmaster's second show has been added at the Lakeshore Theater.  Very good.  See?  Why?  Nothing but bad mouth, Chicago.  Yeah.  He's bilking you out of your money.  And by the way.  Die.  Die. 
[01:36:30]  Get in the coffin.  A reason that we did lose a bunch of cities is because people got turned on to XM.  One should be really honest there, man.  Pulpro Bornstein, sir.  One should be real honest with the people out there.  This is a tough one that we're in the middle of here.  Hey, it's Black History Month.  Here's today's honoree.  For the people that linger longer, they're going to love this one today.  Opie and Anthony.  In honor of Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony show is honoring black heroes, 
[01:37:00]  African-American individuals throughout history, without whom this country would not be the melting pot.  It is today.  Today, we honor the fine citizens of Mobile, Alabama's Crichton community,  who were fortunate enough to be visited by a tree-dwelling leprechaun,  who apparently lost his way en route to his pot of gold.  Could be a crackhead who got home to the wrong stuff,  and they told him to get up in a tree and play a leprechaun.  Without these detailed eyewitness accounts, 
[01:37:30]  this magical encounter may never have been noticed.  I want to know where to go now.  I want to go.  Give me the gold.  I want to go.  Stay tuned for more icons of black history on the Opie and Anthony show.  We're just a bunch of idiots.  Opie and Anthony.  I won't argue that point.  The great Jim Norton and Bob Kelly in the studio. 
[01:38:00]  Opie looks good.  I know.  You're a creep, Bob.  You just look good, Opie.  You commented about my belt as soon as you saw me.  Well, let me tell you something.  Fat people, they look for that stuff.  For what?  Look for people who can actually go more than one notch on their belt.  You can do that, too.  Just get the Bible belt.  And I had to admit to Bob Kelly.  An asteroid belt.  I don't like that.  Asteroid.  I don't like that he actually slapped his knee on that one.  Yes, it was a knee slapper. 
[01:38:30]  Anthony's very happy these days.  I got to admit something, though.  Bob Kelly hurt my feelings about a year ago.  He goes, everyone talks about how you have great abs.  Look at you.  You got a little ponch going.  Yeah.  And I went home that day, and I was very sad.  Aw.  And I started doing ab work.  Yeah, well.  And now I'm back down to a 30 and a half, I would call it.  30 and a half waist.  That's my ankle.  Really?  Yeah, that's my ankle.  Yeah, but look at these guns.  Yeah, Opie does look good. 
[01:39:00]  You do.  You're in shape.  And then you're talking about my haircut.  Get away from me.  You got rid of those little bangs you had.  I don't really have bangs.  Yeah, you did.  Oh, I had bangs?  Yeah, you had bangs.  Bang.  You're just jealous, because you don't.  No, not the head.  I just, you know.  When was the last time you had bangs?  You look like a...  All right.  You're going to make me uncomfortable.  All right, forget it.  Thank you.  Well, let me compliment you.  I was going to compliment you.  I really was.  All right, well, go ahead.  Like a C. Thomas Howell.  Yeah, a C. Thomas Howell.  Go ahead.  Or like, you know, like REO Speedwag is the lead singer now. 
[01:39:30]  What's wrong with you?  I don't know.  What are you going to do?  We're becoming friends.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  All right, I'll get you back with this, with the help of Steven S.  He writes, hey, Ope, can you get Blob to sing silver and gold on Pal Talk for us?  I think he misspelled my name.  I don't think that was...  You look like...  Who was it?  A Burl Ives?  It looks like Burl Ives.  Silver and gold.  You know that he looks like a Vietnam vet when, like, Balboa's about to rescue him?  When they open the door to the bamboo prison, he comes out, hey, man, keep it down. 
[01:40:00]  Jesus Christ.  They'll hear you.  By the way, I like Six Movie Morph Bob took Rocky and made him Rambo.  Balboa's about to rescue him and punched him with his boxing gloves.  That's my name, Six Movie Bob.  How's it going, Lonely?  Six Sandwich Bob.  I want to know how Anthony's doing without his cheeky.  I'm in my house?  Yeah.  And, uh... 
[01:40:30]  No more candles.  No more candles.  No little picture frames.  Just essential guy stuff.  Yeah, no more, like, little towels that match the shower curtain.  Well, I did have monogrammed towels in the bathroom.  I don't...  Look, I didn't buy anything.  You had monogrammed towels?  That was it.  There was, like...  Really?  It wasn't big, gaudy ones, but there was, like, towels that never get used in the bathroom.  You know, show towels. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  And one had an A on it.  And one had an...  The next one should have an H, because that's what you are to have them.  Yeah.  The other one, of course, had an M on it, but it was like, what are you going to do with  just one of those?  That's from Miss Me.  So, I walk in the bathroom after, you know, she came in and moved her stuff, and just  the A towel was there.  All lonely by itself on the towel.  The little A towel was just sitting there. 
[01:41:30]  She took a Sharpie and wrote, hole.  Yeah, that was Jimmy's talk.  Why don't you just do Jimmy's material?  What do you think the H stood for?  A hat?  He wishes he was Bob Gally.  Hey, I got brown towels.  Yeah.  Simple.  I got a bunch of towels to cover up brown.  Oh, God.  Brown to cover up brown.  Oh, Jesus.  I read it in a magazine somewhere.  I have a very utilitarian guy house now.  It's all just computer equipment and flat screen televisions, Xbox games, and booze. 
[01:42:00]  Hey, you live like a spy.  Like a spy.  Yeah.  In case something happens, you go in a little drawer, take out nine passports.  Foreign money.  I have a whole suitcase with different countries' money in it.  I just want to be there late at night to see how lonely you are in that big king bed you have.  Sleeping with all your guns.  You roll over to make a joke.  Hey, honey, did you hear that on TV? 
[01:42:30]  Oh.  I don't do that.  Oh, you did.  You know you were in bed watching TV.  She was kind of sleeping.  And instead, she said something funny on the TV.  And you're like, did you hear, oh, nobody's here.  Nobody's here.  You should just wrap pillows around your gun so you have something to hold on.  Oh, I could sleep with my gun with pillows wrapped around it.  No, Anthony would tap her and go, did you hear that funny joke?  And she'd look at the TV.  It'd be Mississippi burning.  Oh, God. 
[01:43:00]  Instead, he just sees perfect iron sheets, not one fold.  I bet he's sleeping on the couch now.  Nobody will laugh at you.  No.  You're stepping around the kitchen.  Are you living in a big bed?  Are you sleeping in the middle of the bed yet?  No, I like my side of the bed.  Oh.  No, no.  What is that?  Did you buy one of those big human-sized pillows for her side of the bed?  No, I didn't.  Look, do you have a body pillow?  Shut up. 
[01:43:30]  I'm going to get you a Shih Tzu.  Here's the...  No.  We're going to take you to Pottery Barn.  There's a reason I sleep on my side.  Yeah, because you had a woman on the other side for the last five years.  Shut up.  Now you have nobody.  Here's why.  Here's why.  Because I have my night table there.  It's with all my, like, stuff on my water and stuff on there.  And the phone.  And your chapstick.  No.  And the alarm clock.  And the remote.  If I was over on the other side of the bed, it's very hard to use the remote for the TV. 
[01:44:00]  Because the TV's too low.  It hasn't been mounted on the wall yet.  So, it's very hard to use the remote.  And what am I going to do?  Sprawl on a king bed?  Yes.  With rose petals on there?  Put all that stuff on the empty portion of the bed.  I have used all the pillows, though.  Oh.  I take them all.  I build a big pillow mountain behind me.  Yeah.  I can sit up on there.  Have you had sex with your pillows yet?  No.  Why am I having sex with pillows?  Oh, I'm the only one?  Yes.  Yes.  Um, yeah.  What'd you do with that big empty dresser? 
[01:44:30]  It's still there.  Just empty.  Empty drawers.  Sounds real hollow when you open the drawers.  Kuh-klunk, kuh-klunk.  You close them.  Kuh-klunk, kuh-klunk, kuh-klunk.  It still smells like new wood.  Yeah.  It's just like cedar.  One little sock she forgot in there.  Did you cry?  You opened it.  The other walk-in closet on the other side of the hall is just empty and echoey.  Oh, God.  It's big.  Mine's completely full, and the other one is all echoey.  Make that into the prison.  Yeah.  When you have the girls that are now living in your house.  They put bars on the thing if they get out of hand.  Yeah, and they misbehave.  You can use that as like a prison cell. 
[01:45:00]  That's like in my bedroom.  Bobby, just to bring you up to speed, we're going to try to get like co-cores.  Yeah, co-cores.  Runaway hot co-cores to live in Anthony's empty house.  That explains the outfit.  And we're also trying to get him a teen hot pajama party at his house.  We're really trying to do this one with pal talk cameras and everything.  Wow.  And we're also trying to get him a prom date, and we're doing speed dialing with him next week.  Wow, that's great. 
[01:45:30]  Speed dating, speed dialing.  I mean, speed dating.  I could just sit in the house and speed dial.  Hi, a Prince Albert in a can?  Speed dating, yes.  We're just trying to help him out, you know?  That's good.  What are you going to have to find somebody who likes a 48-year-old lonely bastard who plays video games?  First of all, I'm not 48.  I'm not a lonely bastard that just plays video games.  Look, I have a life here where I got to get up early.  That's a problem because I can't go out on weeknights.  Are you going to feel weird dressing up like D'Artagnan on Halloween now by yourself? 
[01:46:00]  You're going to have nobody there to go, you look good, you look good.  Oh, Jesus.  You look good.  No, you look fine.  You're going to have to walk out dressed like that with nobody.  I have to do this.  What?  Why do you think I'm this lonely guy?  I hear this excitement in Bob Kelly's voice.  You've been waiting for this day, it sounds like.  You don't.  Oh, great.  He's got a picture.  Eron's got the picture up of me.  You're going to have to walk out of your house like that by yourself.  At least when you had your chick, people would be like, oh, they must be going to a concert  party.  He's going to look at you like, look at him. 
[01:46:30]  What a lonely loser.  He put on that outfit by himself.  Look at him.  I think he's now a LARP.  Do you know how lonely it is to unsheathe a sword from its scion by yourself?  Oh.  You stink.  He's Richie Rich if Richie Rich got old.  I know.  You have a big house too, right?  It's not small.  How many bedrooms?  It's two.  Two bedrooms, 2,000 square feet.  You have two shy of me in a hotel.  No, it's not two.  One, two, three, four, five, six. 
[01:47:00]  Six bedrooms.  You have a six bedroom house?  You live alone?  You have six bedrooms and three friends.  Each friend could have two bedrooms.  People suggesting, Coke Logic is suggesting Lonely Ant 15.  I could do Lonely Ant, actually Lonely Ant 48-ish.  No, it's no.  You should rent out some of your rooms as storage for other people.  I'm not going to become a storage facility.  It's perfect to get girls living there. 
[01:47:30]  They're down to their luck a little bit and really hot.  At the same time?  You don't think I spend time conversing with girls or anything like that?  You don't think I'm...  That answer is...  Oh?  Oh?  False.  Damn it!  No, I think...  I mean, dude, you're in a great position right now.  You're single.  It's over.  Uh-huh.  Right?  And you have a six bedroom house.  Yeah.  A bunch of guns. 
[01:48:00]  A mansion.  You got money in the bank.  I got a pool going in too, by the way.  Yeah, you have a mustache.  It's a pool.  That was good.  Hats.  You like the mustache?  And you get a bulge.  It looks like half a tire in front of your pants.  I'm getting a haircut today.  Winnie Mandela is going to wrap someone up in that enrollment and fall on fire.  Oh, God.  If I may, delicious looking.  So uncomfortable.  Let's say hi to April in Cleveland.  April. 
[01:48:30]  Hey, guys.  Hi, April.  Hi, April.  Uh, Anthony.  Yeah.  I wanted to, uh, offer, uh, my bed warming services for that empty side.  Oh, really?  See?  They're out there.  Yeah.  What, what could you, uh, give Anthony?  Well, I don't know if I could give him full time, but I'd be willing to, you know, go to  his house maybe one week on demand.  What is it, the National Guard?  Yeah, the National Guard.  That's fine. 
[01:49:00]  In two weeks a year, she stays there on active duty.  She just keeps getting in weight and she can't fit into a uniform.  You know, I've seen Anthony in person and he's really cute and I want to be a susceptible.  Well, Jesus.  Whoa.  You make it sound so romantic.  That answer is.  What is it?  True.  Oh.  People are saying she sounds like a cougar.  Wow.  Are you, are you a cougar?  Uh, yeah, I can be. 
[01:49:30]  Do you know what a cougar is?  Can be.  Can be.  Ugh.  How old are you?  I'm 32.  Good.  Bye.  Oh my God.  I know what Anthony likes.  Jesus Christ.  Good bye.  I know.  I'm too old.  Oh my God.  Good bye.  You need a backpack if you're going to date Anthony.  That's right.  This is getting very uncomfortable.  You got to get past me.  I know what Anthony likes.  You don't like 32 year olds.  He doesn't like anybody with a pocketbook.  Turn that age around and maybe, maybe, maybe. 
[01:50:00]  Look.  He wants a backpack.  Some kind of Hello Kitty wear.  A swatch watch.  Anthony actually has a Blues Clues DVD collection.  You sons of bitches.  Anthony, I got something for you today.  Have you heard about the lonesome loser?  Thank you.  Beaten by the Queen of Oz every time.  Have you heard about the lonesome loser? 
[01:50:30]  He's a loser, but he still keeps on trying.  Keep on trying.  Yeah, that's me.  Anthony walks to his house right now with no shirt and just feety pajama bottoms.  Does he like the way the bottom of the feety part sounds on the big wood floor?  I have tile floors that are heated.  Oh, really?  Yes, it's wonderful.  Radiant heat in the floor.  Stephen S. from Bayshore.  The tuxies get cold.  Stephen S. from Bayshore writes, 32.  Beat it, Granny. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, God damn.  Maybe if you have a grand kid.  Last night was nice.  I got home.  I poured myself a little glass of wine.  And I put a log in the fire.  You said little?  Yeah.  I thought you were going to play, that answer is false.  That's good.  You got heated bathroom tiles.  This way, if you need service while you're busy, you can just sit there and someone can  just kneel on that nice warm floor.  It is very nice and warm.  I don't like the smell.  Put a nose clip on.  I'm a millionaire. 
[01:51:30]  You can just drop it on the ground until it cooks and then scrape it off with a spatula.  Oh, God damn.  Like an omelet whore.  You guys are killing me, man.  You guys.  Oh, you're just killing me.  Michael Jackson's going to be having a garage sale, man.  Maybe he can get the first wheel.  Yeah.  I think you have enough room in the backyard for a first wheel.  I'm putting a Ferris wheel in.  And it's not like you can just walk out of your house.  Like, us three can just, you know, walk out of our house and go do things. 
[01:52:00]  And, you know, we're in the city.  I'm in the suburbs.  You walk out and you just see happy families.  Yeah, but I could get in a nice, fast car and...  And go nowhere.  No, I could go somewhere.  Where are you going to go?  I could go to a bar.  Yeah, really?  At three in the morning when it hits you?  What's hitting me at three in the morning?  The alarm clock to come here?  Bobby, what did he do to you?  You have these eyes that are piercing eyes.  No, this is what Bobby...  I've been there.  Bobby's talking about himself. 
[01:52:30]  I've been there.  Are you right?  The emotional mess that is Robert Kelly is talking about himself, weeping on the bed.  I've been there.  All alone.  I've been there.  And you will be again.  I'm not there now.  Hold on.  I got another song for you.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Go do that one.  I like that one.  Is it too late?  It's the matter where you're out.  You're out.  You're out doing a good job today, man.  Stop it.  I swear to God.  Compared to what?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Do it again.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Good.  I want to love you, my pretty young man.  You need some loving. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, boy.  This is not good.  I can't wait until Anthony starts taking ballroom dancing.  Ballroom dancing?  I'm not into that.  By the way, you should have got the other Michael Jackson song that he likes.  I'm talking to the dictator in the mirror.  Oh, God.  I'm not...  Look, I've been there.  I've been there.  I know it is.  I mean, you know, I'm married now.  I got a chick.  All three of us have chicks.  We're happy.  We have people that we go home to.  Why?  You're not happy? 
[01:53:30]  No, it's terrific.  Oh, really?  I love the PMS and being yelled at.  No!  Terrific.  I thought you were happy.  It rules.  Every time I see you, I'm a son.  No!  You're a happy man.  I hate being able to do whatever I want, whenever I want.  That sucks.  Bobby, I'm with you.  I am not in that position, though, where...  Like, when I go to bed at night, I can turn the TV on, and I don't have to strain. 
[01:54:00]  You know...  That reminds me of a song.  It does?  No?  Let me tell you.  My relationship wasn't this thing that ended in this giant blow-up or anything like that.  It was just...  You know, it kind of ended.  You guys...  So...  Look, if you ever see couples out, every couple's different when they're out in public.  Like, Opie's a certain way with his chick, you know, and I'm a different way, and Jim  Norton's a different way.  You were very, you know, snuggly, cuddly-y. 
[01:54:30]  You guys were always together.  Was I?  Yeah, a little bit.  Every time I...  Think.  At the virus thing.  Think about the past year.  Oh, well.  I remember you at the virus, her lying, and you guys in your little room having wine,  and...  You guys look cute.  I'm not saying it's bad.  I thought it was cute.  He wasn't cuddling.  He was...  He was dealing with a hangover from his gambling trip.  I was just leaning on it because he was...  He had a hangover?  All right.  You don't remember what Bob Saget said?  He goes, is that guy all right?  No, I just...  You thought they were cuddling?  Bob Saget was questioning if I was okay? 
[01:55:00]  He pulled an all-nighter.  He was hung over his ass.  No, I just thought they were leaning on it.  I didn't know she was...  He was leaning on her for support.  I just really need the literal weight support I needed.  The listener's truly helping you out.  Jimmy in Jersey, what do you got here?  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  Four words for you.  Foreign exchange student housing.  Ooh.  I'm foreign exchange.  My mother did that.  Ooh.  Oh, really?  And you do get some hotties.  Dude, get a nanny.  Doesn't matter.  You don't have kids.  A nanny?  Nanny's...  Now I are a nanny with no children. 
[01:55:30]  Dude, the nanny's...  That's beautiful.  Nanny's...  Oh, I don't know where Junior is.  The nanny, especially in the Huntington area?  Loose.  Really?  And they travel in packs and speak...  They speak languages that you don't understand?  Great.  But they're loose?  Make her whole job is to wash your balls.  Oh, my God.  That'll never...  Can you say that?  We're on CBS.  Can you say that?  We're talking about his sports balls.  Oh, okay.  He should have made a golf joke first, I guess.  That's right.  Her whole job is to wash them. 
[01:56:00]  To wash them good.  Yeah, with a scrub.  It's not a bad thing.  Like, I get to do things that I kind of wanted to...  Yes?  All by myself.  Yeah.  I don't want to be all by myself anymore.  I thought we had one is the loneliest number, but we don't.  You know that song comes on.  Three Dog Night?  You don't have that? 
[01:56:30]  No, I thought we did.  That was the one I was trying to go to before.  He's doing 100 down the highway, and he's listening to that song.  He keeps replaying it, because he wants to get back to the chorus.  The all by myself.  That's, again, emotionally wrecked Bobby Kelly.  Yeah.  Dude, you're going to be there.  You're happy right now.  What?  And I'm there for you, dude.  Call me up.  We'll play a little Call of Duty, me and you.  It was very, you know, just kind of...  So I sit, and I just kind of...  Stuff moved out. 
[01:57:00]  Like I said, it's now very utilitarian.  Where is she right now?  I just got an apartment.  You have no idea?  Keeping tabs on exactly where people go.  This is what happened.  He came home one day with a very special belt that he wanted her to wear.  Yeah.  This may look like an odd belt for you to...  I'm going to touch my toes.  I want you to put this special belt on and run at me with it.  It was never a special belt.  And it's not gay because your mom gave it to you for Christmas.  What? 
[01:57:30]  Absolutely.  Was the belt hook six and a half inches long?  Special belt.  Why was he a rookie?  It was black and a lot longer.  It looked like the pillar in front of the house.  Oh, hold on, man.  What a funny looking belt, Dan.  Let me jump back in here.  She's gone.  Oh, I.  Oh, I.  I better learn how to face.  She's gone.  She's gone.  Oh, I.  Oh, I.  All right.  That one hurt a little bit.  Did it?  Awkward.  I think Anthony's okay, man.  He's fine.  I'm A-okay. 
[01:58:00]  I know you're okay.  I really am.  Things in life run their course sometimes, and that's the way it is.  It is.  You got to, you know, you got to move on.  It's just a dangerous space to be in.  Is it?  Well, dude, think about it.  Think about you.  You're gambling.  You drink a little bit.  You had somebody...  Did you say a little bit?  Well, I said it with a smirk.  What?  I can't see it on the radio, but...  And you had somebody to kind of ran you in a little bit.  Now you threw that rule, all that out, that rule maker out.  Yeah.  Now you're living in this big six-bedroom house by yourself. 
[01:58:30]  How many bathrooms?  Six and a half.  You have six and a half bathrooms?  Yeah.  Full?  Well, six and a half.  Some have shower, just shower.  Some have tub shower, and then the master has jacuzzi and big walk-in shower with a big  glass door, and 18,000 jets that can hit you all over, and a built-in, like, with a tile  bench thingy.  When you shut the shower off, when you shut all that, and all that noise goes away from 
[01:59:00]  the shower, and there's nothing in the house, that doesn't bug you?  I'm washing myself.  Why would it bug me?  Hey, we have to take a break, so we've got to do a couple things really quick.  One more song.  One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do.  I like this song.  I like three-dug me.  He's got a good voice.  The loneliest number since the number one.  Be careful.  All right.  You should have a three-dog night. 
[01:59:30]  Just bring three pigs in.  Don't even tell them if the other ones are there.  You just want a bedroom.  You try to keep it down.  We've got to take a break, but we've got to get the plugs in.  First for Jimmy.  Norton's so funny.  Drive downtown, go to the House of Blues, and pay money to see him?  There you go.  Benjamin Borsen.  Wow.  Look at that plug you just got.  Yeah, Norton.  Tomorrow morning, my Chicago tickets go on sale for April 25th.  First show sold out at the Lakeshore Theater, so the second show tickets go on sale tomorrow.  Ticketmaster.  And Bob Kelly, who's just blowing up in more ways than one.  When's that DVD coming out there, Bobby? 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, it's coming out April 8th.  New CD, DVD coming out.  A little Jimmy Norton's on my DVD, too.  Very exciting.  Is there any way to hear Jimmy's plug one more time?  You like that?  Yeah, sure.  And Norton's so funny.  Yeah, we know.  Thank you.  Where's the plug, though?  Norton's so funny.  Drive downtown, go to the House of Blues, and pay money to see him?  Very good.  That's great.  That's Benjamin Bornstein in Cleveland.  Good boy, Ben.  Good boy.  Plugging Jimmy.  Bananas Comedy Club for Bob Kelly this Friday and Saturday. 
[02:00:30]  Hasbrook Heights, New Jersey, 201-727-1090.  We're going to take a quick break and finish up this mess next.  Is this another guilty pleasure from the staff?  Really?  Hey, Bobby, do you have a guilty pleasure?  Yeah.  I don't think so.  Yeah, all right.  I think ass play. 
[02:01:00]  No, we were talking about a song.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry.  When I'm watching TV and I'm holding the remote in one hand and I use the other.  All right, all right, all right, all right.  His answer was blank play.  Guilty pleasure.  Who on the staff likes this song?  Steve?  This is Steve's guilty pleasure right here.  The lead singer of Foundry.  This is what he likes when he goes down that guilty pleasure road.  Hey, Kenny, do you have a guilty pleasure?  Oh, this should be good.  You're not going to take Jimmy's mic. 
[02:01:30]  Are you crazy?  Maybe you could play it on the XM side.  What is it?  It's a song by 2 Live Crew.  Oh.  That's your guilty pleasure?  Yeah.  Oh, I know you.  I like ABBA.  Anything from ABBA.  What?  Mama Mia.  Parmoneese.  Here we go again.  All right.  Oh, God.  Like Maxwell.  Yeah.  We're in the middle of a speed round here.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  We got a brand new promo.  Oh, okay. 
[02:02:00]  Now, Bobby doesn't know.  Bobby.  Sorry.  Focus.  Yep.  Bobby doesn't know that.  Anthony, focus.  I'm trying.  Go ahead.  All right.  Just don't want to smell that.  Bobby just laid out.  We're trying to get Anthony a prom date because it is prom season.  We're very suspicious that this whole breakup occurred a mere month or so before the prom.  Right.  So we're trying to get him a prom date.  Yeah.  We actually got some people calling the special prom hotline.  Well, thank goodness for that.  Yeah.  When we pick the prom date, can we actually have him come down the cellar like all the proms do 
[02:02:30]  and go to one of the shows that me in normal format for him and his prom date?  I just hope I could get a limo with a sunroof so I could stick my head out the top and go,  wee.  Well, yes, Bobby.  He can bring his date down there as long as the seats are very, very cushy.  Oh, they're very cushy.  Because you don't know what this whole prom date thing is all about yet.  You still have to bring up those little blow-up donut things you sign after a roid surgery. 
[02:03:00]  See, this is a very hacky radio bit, but we're doing it in our own special style.  Well, why wouldn't we?  The girl has to put out, and they have to put out in a very special way.  Okay.  Three different ways.  Actually, including hands.  So do you want to hear your â€“ well, actually, let's go with the new concept, too, because  we're working many different angles with Anthony is Single.  We got the prom date thing.  We got the â€“ what else?  We're trying to set up the big house with â€“  Coke whores.  Whores.  That are down on their luck. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Wayward Coke whores.  Speed dating.  Coming to the show soon.  Speed dating.  Wayward â€“ you're going to have a rehab?  Yeah, I want to open up, like, just for, like, Coke whores.  That way, a little bit of Coke, and you're set.  And then I figure â€“ because they could have one wing, and then I stay in the other wing,  I'll set up an electric fence and put collars on them so they can't cross over where my valuables are.  Their head explodes if they don't.  Yeah, they just get â€“ they get electrocuted.

[02:05:30]  No.  He's only 57.  I've got quite a lot of time.  No, I'm not.  He's only 50, 51, somewhere around.  All right, Mr. 30.  Yeah, I'm 32.  I'll admit it.  Liar, liar.  Pants on fire.  All right, keep this close.  We got to go play this promo a lot.  I'm still firmly entrenched in my 40s.  Leave me alone.  You old broad.  Shut up.  He's a mustache.  It is true.  What's wrong with his mustache?  It looks good.  I got a little thing going here.  I shaved the bottom part because it was a little too much. 
[02:06:00]  Gray.  Gray.  Why don't you just get some medicine?  You said a little?  What?  Medicine?  What are you talking about?  Get the medicine.  I'm not getting medicine.  What do you mean medicine?  Hair dye?  I'm not going to dye my beard.  It's not dye.  It's medicine.  Dye it blonde.  I'm like, bleach it.  Yeah, there you go.  Don't be a nut.  Just bleach your hair.  Yeah, bleach it blonde, dude.  You look great.  Cut it into a Hitler mustache and bleach it blonde.  Good news.  We got four potential prom dates for you, Anthony.  Oh, great news.  Let's run through this really fast.  Great news.  First one is Brianna.  Brianna wants to go to the prom with him. 
[02:06:30]  Brianna.  Okay.  Yep.  Ready?  Mm-hmm.  Hi, my name's Brianna.  I'm 18.  I'm 5'7".  Why is the dude?  135 pounds.  Got long brown hair.  I am a transsexual.  And Anthony can have the b**** all he wants.  All right.  What do you think of Brianna so far?  Well, you know, it's the first one, so it set the bar.  Okay.  If you don't want her.  Jimmy's all of a sudden going out to buy a tux from prom. 
[02:07:00]  Jimmy was licking his little lipstick.  All right.  How about, let's meet Kelly.  Potential prom day for him, right?  Hi, this is Kelly.  And I would like to ask Anthony to come to my prom.  A little bit about me.  I'm 5'10", 210 pounds.  But I carry my weight well.  I like online poker, collecting memorabilia from World War II. 
[02:07:30]  And, of course, I like working out.  Anthony, if you'd like to come to my prom, let me know.  And maybe we can work out together sometime.  Love you.  Bye.  All right.  Well, what do you think of Kelly?  I don't know.  I'm going to have to hear another call, maybe, if Kelly could call back.  There's something obviously wrong with the phone on that one.  It was recording wrong.  Well, let's see what Cheryl's all about. 
[02:08:00]  Cheryl.  Hi, my name's Cheryl.  I go to John Glenn High School out on Long Island.  And I'm an 18-year-old.  I would love Anthony to be my day.  I will definitely put out for Anthony.  And I'm a very cute, 18-year-old girl.  So, I hope to see you.  The guy didn't even try.  Why the horrific quality?  Is there a reason for that? 
[02:08:30]  What do you mean?  Of the caller?  Well, it's just the audio.  It's awful.  It's horrendous.  Yeah.  Why is that?  It's getting that underwater sound to it.  It makes it hard for Anthony to figure out who it is.  Yeah, you know.  It's weird.  It makes them sound like they might be male or something.  Why the bad quality on the phone there, Steve?  Well, it's just what we pulled off the FU line.  I'm going to check with Mars when we get back to XM.  Of course.  Why is that?  It's the phone again.  It's the phone again. 
[02:09:00]  Don't wreck another one of our bets by, well, let me just shut the F up.  Here's your last one for today, Ant.  Yes, this is Fleet Man, and I would like to take Anthony to the prom.  I do put out.  I've never been to a prom.  I've been rejected in most things.  I tried to be an intern for radio shows and was rejected there.  Again, this is Fleet Man, and I'm just desperately seeking some love.  That actually was a message he left while you were still with a girlfriend. 
[02:09:30]  That was a real message, and the phone quality just sucks.  How about we fix the phone?  Oh!  That just...  Smash.  How are people supposed to listen to that and enjoy it?  Yeah, how?  I don't know.  How, Jimmy?  All right.  We're going to leave you with the bleep game that we never got to yesterday.  Yes.  Really quick.  We had a peeping Tom story yesterday, Wabi, and just in case you missed it,  this is the news story. 
[02:10:00]  A woman gets the shock of her life when she finds that she's living below a peeping neighbor.  The man is accused of watching her through a hole that he drilled into her bathroom.  Local 4th, Hank Winchester is live in Romulus right now,  and Hank, how did this woman spot the hole?  Well, Ruth, when you see the hole, you'll agree it is hard to miss.  Take a live look behind me here.  You can see the victim lives on the first floor.  The accused people are right upstairs.  The only thing separating those two apartments is a little plywood.  Police say that was nothing. 
[02:10:30]  The guy, he's thrilled.  Why?  He wasn't remodeling.  He wanted to take a look into the shower down below.  Okay.  Right.  We've heard those type of stories before.  It was a big hole.  Yeah, but now you throw a few bleeps in that same news story, it sounds a little different.  A woman gets the shock of her life when she finds that she's living below a peeping neighbor.  The man is accused of seeing her through a hole that he drilled into her bathroom.  Local 4th, Hank Winchester is live in Romulus right now, 
[02:11:00]  and Hank, how did this woman spot the hole?  Well, Ruth, when you see the hole, you'll agree it is hard to miss.  Take a live look behind me here.  You can see the victim lives on the first floor.  The accused is right upstairs.  The only thing separating those two apartments is a little plywood.  Wow, that changes the story drastically, doesn't it?  Hey, let's say hi to Michelle in Oklahoma.  Michelle.  Yeah. 
[02:11:30]  Hi, Michelle.  Hi.  What's going on?  I'm really not a man, and I'll take you to my prom.  Oh.  When's your prom?  Yeah.  Okay.  That's what I like.  Put the brake on your wheelchair on.  Honey, I really do put out.  People say, when was your prom?  1967.  Does it matter?  Her prom song was God Bless America.  There's only 13 stars on the flag.  I don't know. 
[02:12:00]  Someone tells me you've had your prom already.  So what?  I didn't have a good time.  I think I'd have a good time with you.  Oh, boy.  How old a bag are you?  Get me another Lucky.  You're too old for Anthony.  Thank you, Michelle.  How old are you, Michelle?  She's out.  Sorry.  Jason Freeport, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I just wanted to let Anthony know there's a charity, a cancer benefit for the Friends of  Chrissy at Mulcahy's on Saturday.  It's from 5 to 9 o'clock, and if Anthony wants to come down, there should be plenty of 
[02:12:30]  single chicks for him.  Why are you going with the serious plug?  Yeah, what are you going with the serious plug?  We would have just done the serious plug for you.  I didn't.  Because it's the first time I've ever called into a radio show.  I just wanted to invite him down and let him know what it was.  All right.  You got the plug out without much nerves, didn't you?  You got the plug out.  Good cause.  There you go.  Go ahead.  Thanks, sir.  Yeah, bye.  Bring the whole room down.  Yeah, bye.  Anthony wants to go to a cancer benefit.  Yeah, that's what I want to do.  All right.  Let's help them pick up their wigs.  Here, let me get that for you.  Jesus.  Show them you're a gentleman.

[02:21:30]  Thank you. 
[02:22:00]  And here we are, XM Satellite Radio.  A couple of things.  I want to congratulate my boy, Brother Wheeze.  He got a gig in Rochester and I couldn't be happier.  What do you mean?  You might want to congratulate Wheeze.  He got so fucked in Rochester.  I can't even tell you.  They fired everybody at CMF, a station I worked at back in the day, a long time ago. 
[02:22:30]  Brother Wheeze is my mentor.  And so they fired the whole staff, but they decided to keep Wheeze, but his contract's up, right?  And this is me talking.  And I'm not tired for Wheeze, but I believe they were offering him about 40% of his contract to keep him.  Oh, wow.  And Wheeze wasn't making that much money to begin with.  He does okay.  But they said, yeah, we want you to continue working for us.  But at 40% of what you were making, of course Wheeze isn't going to take that bullshit.  So he's like, fuck you. 
[02:23:00]  And then I believe it's a Clear Channel station up there in Rochester.  The Fox.  What's wrong?  The Fox.  I can't take this in today.  Are you farting in the middle of a very serious moment that I'm having here, Bob?  It's so utterly bad.  Are you farting?  It's either Bob or Jimmy.  I am talking about my hero.  No, dude.  I'm with you.  So the Fox up there in Rochester did the right thing.  And they hired Brother Wheeze.  Even though Brother Wheeze has to sit out a non-compete for a pretty long time. 
[02:23:30]  How long?  I think at least six months, not longer.  So Clear Channel, I believe they're the Fox of Rochester, did the right thing.  Hired Wheeze anyway.  They're making him kind of like a sales guy for the next six months while he waits out at no-compete.  And then he's going to completely destroy the company that took over CMF up there.  And I'm very, very happy for my boy, my mentor.  Brother Wheeze.  And a no-compete.  Like, you guys run a...  Weren't you guys on one of those, too?  Yeah.  Well, then we got an agent, and he knows how to do it the right way. 
[02:24:00]  Like, Wheeze signed some stuff he might have...  Regretted.  Regretted.  But you get paid.  So this is the...  He didn't get paid.  So you don't get paid on a...  Well, yeah, that's what's so fucked up about this.  So, yeah, hear me out.  This is what makes it interesting.  Imagine you're making full salary.  Your contract is up, whatever.  And all of a sudden, this company now offers you 40% of what you were making.  And you can't just say, no, fuck you, and go across the street.  You have to either take the 40% of your current salary, or sit out and not get paid for close 
[02:24:30]  to a year.  So you can make the money that you are deserved.  How do they do that?  I thought that was only if the offer was matched.  He should fight that.  We should fight that.  That's bullshit.  I don't know what he's got planned, but they, you know, he's got a station up there that  really believes in him, and they're going to, like, try to figure something out.  But they're very excited in Rochester that Wheeze is coming back soon, and might want to  congratulate Wheeze.  He doesn't even like Rochester. 
[02:25:00]  Is that a Rochester?  If you can find his email.  Yeah.  For how long?  No, he got let go, technically, as they were trying to renegotiate in December.  He hasn't done a radio show in almost three months.  Wow.  Two and a half months, something like that.  So, if you know Brother Wheeze's email, I don't want to give it out, because it would  just destroy his email account.  You don't want to confuse it with, you know.  Yeah, if you know how to get a hold of him.  Does he have MySpace?  I don't even know at this point.  You know, congratulate Brother Wheeze.  I'm very, very happy. 
[02:25:30]  Extremely happy.  We're trying to get him on XM for a little bit, but I don't know if he's allowed to do that  either.  And in other news, you might want to congratulate an old radio station of ours, WISP in Philly.  You know, they know what they're doing, and they decided to cut ties with the Opie and  Anthony show.  You might remember that fine radio story.  Well, a little ratings thing came out yesterday, and I want to congratulate WISP.  They really know what they're doing down there.  They lost 25% of their audience in the last month and a half. 
[02:26:00]  So, congratulations to WISP and the fine moves they're making down there.  Great music format.  It's a big hit.  No, you guys know what you're doing.  You know, I lose on this one.  You're right.  25% of their audience in the last month and a half alone.  You can look it up for yourself.  It's on Radio and Records.  There's a little people meter ratings thing at the top of the page.  Well, you hit ratings, and then at the top of the ratings page, you'll see something  like PPMs or something like that.  You can see the latest data for yourself.  Just terrific for that fine station down there in Philly.  Job well done.  That used to be a powerhouse. 
[02:26:30]  Used to be a powerhouse.  They bring in some hick fucking PD, and he thinks he knows what he's doing.  Go fuck yourself.  Still better.  Yes, Bobby.  We should have never lost Philly.  Well, why don't they give it back to us?  Fucking bullshit.  Why don't they just give it back to us?  Uh, because the guy running the joint doesn't like us.  So why don't they get rid of him?  He obviously is not good.  Yeah, no kidding.  Get rid of him.  The guy obviously has his head in his patoot. 
[02:27:00]  Whoa, language.  Yeah.  You just got to sit back in this stupid business.  That's all I've noticed.  Yeah, I know.  Sit back long enough and wait for fucking the tide to change.  Wait for people to come in.  Blow out.  You guys have a huge...  Fired, hired.  If I could only talk about my dinner last night, my God, is it going to get interesting.  My God, Matt.  My God.  Well, go ahead.  Spill the beans.  What'd you have?  Well, I had a nice Mediterranean fish sheet.  How much? 
[02:27:30]  I had a Mediterranean fish sheet, Jimmy.  A fish sheet.  How much?  I didn't have to pay.  Was everything Alicart?  Alicart.  I like when it comes with things.  Do they have an Alicart menu where you're going to get Brussels sprouts and beans and  potatoes, but you got to pay for them?  I was offered Brussels sprouts and a little known fact, I hate Brussels sprouts.  I like Brussels sprouts because they look like balls.  I had the Mediterranean fish sheet. 
[02:28:00]  A little Mediterranean fish sheet.  How much?  It was, I believe, I believe it was $32.  I'll have the Scrod.  Scrod?  This is a Mediterranean restaurant.  Oh, no.  They fly the fish in from the Mediterranean Sea, my friend.  If you want fresh fish, you have to have a fushi.  That's my new character.  It's Asian guy who lisps.  I like it.  How does it sound?  I talk like that with fushi.  I like to have some.  That sounds like a mongoloid guy.  Sounds like a Chinese guy with a stroke. 
[02:28:30]  No, I did not have dinner with Earl.  I know Wednesday night was dinner night with Earl.  Earl.  Catfish.  Yeah, but as soon as I got the gig for Earl, he blew off Wednesday night dinner with  Oak.  So, go fuck yourself, Earl.  I can't wait for them to fire you.  That's right.  I had a great meal last night.  You ungrateful fuck.  I had fucking, I had some shoofly pie and a nice pound of marmalade.  A pound of marmalade.  Marmalade.  A pound of orange marmalade with tangerine flecks in it. 
[02:29:00]  Yuck.  Yuck.  All right, so the dinner was good.  It was, yeah, it was, yeah, things were shaking and baking.  Oh, yeah.  Elo didn't even know about this meal.  Whoa.  Well, now he does.  I took things into my own hands.  Elo didn't know about it.  Where was it?  An AA meeting?  I'm taking things into my own hands at this point.  Ooh.  Top secret meetings all over the city of New York.  Hey, uh, gotta throw myself under the bus for just a second, though. 
[02:29:30]  I only want to be under there for maybe a second or two, okay?  I don't think you get to determine that.  I think that we, you got under the bus.  I don't think you get to just pull yourself out.  I think that we make the determination.  If a tire or two rolls over you, you're not getting up so quick.  If we stop and put it in park.  On top of you.  That's right.  Remember.  Delicious ass crack of yours.  Remember.  For a couple days in a row, I was bragging about how I'm trying to get knowledge and I'm reading the New York Times.  Knowledge.  See, Thin's already laughing. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, yeah.  And Travis is coming in.  And everyone wants to be a part of this.  Because I made Travis work his balls off.  Do you remember that I was saying that I read a fine article in the New York Times about the horned screamer?  The horned screamer, which is that nasty sounding bird.  Yeah.  That wakes people up and drives down property values.  Where is it?  Florida?  Mexico?  Where the fuck is that place?  It's somewhere in South America.  This bird is only in a few areas in South America driving people from their homes. 
[02:30:30]  And other people that are buying the homes, they're thinking, wow, I'm getting a fine piece of property.  Because they're unaware of what this horned screamer could do.  This is the actual audio of the horned screamer.  That's not bad.  Oh, sorry.  This is audio of Bob Kelly in the shower.  Where's my horned screamer?  Oh, damn.  Ow.  Face.  This sounds much better on XM, by the way, because you don't have the processing that kind of smooth drives you all from this. 
[02:31:00]  Listen to this fucking thing.  Driving people from their homes all day long, by the way.  To imagine... 
[02:31:30]  Imagine.  Almost done.  Just want to make sure it fully annoys everybody out there. 
[02:32:00]  You sure there isn't like a group of rednecks raping some c'moners?  That's the sound, by the way.  Yeah.  That way you take a hard piece of plastic tubing and you dry fuck yourself in the ass.  That's the sound it makes.  Hello, Ernie.  Hello, Ernie.  Hello. 
[02:32:30]  It sounds like a mountain climber from The Price is Right being deep-dicked with his face in a pillow.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  I was just kidding about Earl, though.  What do you mean?  He's already suicidal.  Is he really?  I think so.  Why is he bummed out?  Because he's black.  Trying to live in a white man's world.  Hey, so that's the horn screamer.  So I wanted to be accurate with my knowledge, and I'm bragging to these guys, right? 
[02:33:00]  I'm going to focus on Bob Kelly as I say this.  So I'm like, yeah, I was reading The Times, man, and I'm just getting some knowledge.  I'm sick of The Post.  It's too cartoony for me.  Opie, who wants to get more knowledge into his life, right?  Right.  So then I start yelling and screaming at Travis.  I'm like, find this fucking article in The Times so I can be accurate with my knowledge, right?  Yeah.  And Travis is Googling.  He's going to the NewYorkTimes.com.  He's calling up newspaper stands.  He's hoping that they have an old copy of The Sunday Times that he can look through. 
[02:33:30]  And I'm at home looking through the life section, the metro, the national section.  I'm trying to find this fucking article, right?  How bad was I, Travis?  You insisted it was in the New York Times magazine, and I said, are you sure it was  in this weekend?  Yeah.  Yes, it was absolutely in this weekend.  Even though you said that, I still looked at like three different New York Times magazines  online.  Just in case.  Can I just say something?  So you're trying to bring something to the table to show people that you're knowledgeable.  Right. 
[02:34:00]  And information about a bird?  Yeah, but the key was that I'm reading the New York Times.  I found this in the Times.  You know what I'm saying here?  It had to be in the Times.  Yeah, it had to be in the Times.  Key to the story.  And I'm losing my mind.  I'm driving all these guys crazy, because all of a sudden now, the OCD's kicking in.  And then I'm at home also looking at the same New York Times that I just picked up first  time in a long time, but making believe I'm reading the Times every day now.  Going page through page through page through page through page.  And my chick finally goes, what are you doing? 
[02:34:30]  I'm like, I'm trying to find that article on the Horde Screamer.  And she goes, you didn't read that in the New York Times.  You read that off a placemat at the restaurant.  A placemat.  Oh, that's fucking hilarious.  I'm bragging about the New York Times.  We're at a restaurant coming home from a little getaway in Connecticut.  And we stop at this restaurant.  And as we're waiting to order, they have that little placemat with cute little things you 
[02:35:00]  can read about.  It was in between the stories on Grimace and Hamburger.  Yeah.  What was that in the New York Times?  It was a little maze that I had to get through.  We should have a mouse to the cheese.  On the year of the pig from a Chinese restaurant.  It was a placemat.  It had a little cup with crayons so you could color in some shit.  But it had a nice little thing on the Horde Screamer.  And you confused a fucking placemat at a restaurant with the New York Times.  He got excited when the pizza came. 
[02:35:30]  That's it.  Oh, my chick just hates me, I think.  Yeah.  How dumb are you?  Get me that thing out of Time Magazine about the election.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  No, that was a fortune cookie.  Yeah.  And I can read her eyes, which are just beautiful.  And I can tell she's going, you know, I'm 11.  I'm an 11 and you're barely a 5.  Yeah.  I'm with you because of your knowledge.  And you're getting it from placemats.  Restaurant placemats. 
[02:36:00]  That means you actually discussed it with her, too.  Because she knew it.  You're like, honey, did you know?  Oh, yeah, of course.  She had a convo with her about it.  Yeah.  He fucking picked up the placemat and he folded it the way someone does in newspaper and he  carried it under his arm.  Like a gentleman.  Reading it on the train.  He was taking a shit reading it.  Cross-country flight and he's only halfway through the placemat.  That's a tough read.  There's a black guy delivering placemats at 5 in the morning to his building. 
[02:36:30]  He rolls it up under his arm like a gentleman.  Like a gentleman.  A gentleman on his way to work.  He's got a fedora and an umbrella.  Yes.  And that under his arm.  I'll learn something today.  Hey, where's the newspaper you were reading?  Oh, it's in my back pocket.  Hold on.  Let me take it out.  I'm getting my knowledge from placemats and restaurants.  That's great.  Congrats.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:37:00]  I love it.  I'll question everything you ask me to find from now on.  I thought it was going to be like another newspaper or a shittier paper.  I didn't realize that it was the wrong form of communication.  It's a placemat.  I'm convinced Lindsay's on the longest lasting roofie in their history.  I'm trying to be more cool around her.  Are you?  Yeah, I'm listening to you guys.  Read a placemat.  That'll do it.  That's cool.  You're like Fonzie cool with that shit. 
[02:37:30]  All the young kids are reading placemats.  The only paper that doesn't fold.  Fucking placemat.  You roll it up and put it behind your ear when you're finished.  Would the dinner Chuck E. Cheese run you?  Anyway, what are you eating that has placemats?  What are you done with your paper?  Do you make an airplane out of it and throw it across the room?  Any restaurant where that has crayons and a paper fucking tablecloth.  I insisted it was the New York Times.  You're bringing an 11 to a Chuck E. Cheese. 
[02:38:00]  That's great.  It's not a good restaurant.  Hey, you should have cloth napkins.  What do you want to read?  The menu.  The wine list.  If you have to read the placemat, it's the house of shit.  It's not a good restaurant.  Hope you're comfy under that bus.  Hey, this was...  Did you have to ask the waiter for an extra sport?  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Well, it was coming back from my stone massage. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  Have you ever had hot stones rubbed all over your naked body?  The stone massage you should have is the same one they give in Iraq.  I got some terrific jokes that I got...  I fucked a chick on a railroad track once after a train went by.  I'm going to be getting some fine one-liners from Bazooka Joe later on this evening.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  I remember those little tidbits of knowledge on the comic. 
[02:39:00]  And words of wisdom from Fortune Cookies.  Yeah.  Yes.  He fucking...  He read it in a fucking...  Oh, shit.  But you have no idea.  I mean, I don't know if I'm doing this justice.  I was driving these guys crazy.  I'm like, it's in the Times.  I read the New York Times now.  Dude.  Dude.  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah.  Dude, you know what?  The Iraq war has gone on for so much longer, dude. 
[02:39:30]  That was supposed to be in the...  You got to go in.  Boom.  Fucking bubble.  Dude, the screeching owl bird, dude.  Dude.  Dude.  The horn swaddler.  The people just fucking kill him.  Yeah, make it a BB gun, dude.  Yeah.  That's the problem.  People got nowhere to live.  We win in Iraq if the werewolf problem wasn't so bad.  Oh, dude.  Werewolf.  Fat Bob Kelly's seen a werewolf.  That animation is huge, bro.  It's on YouTube. 
[02:40:00]  Check it out.  Throw Opie and Anthony in the search.  Poor Bob is fat Bob Kelly now.  He couldn't be happy about it.  Oh, my God.  I know.  Dude, and we're making fun of you, and you're trying to turn to see who's talking to you,  and you have to move your whole body in this animation.  Have you seen this yet?  That's definitely true.  Have you seen this?  I have seen it.  Put it up on the big screen so he can make fun of Bob Kelly now, because I crawled under.  I just get a kick out of Torch and Children.  They're showing kids being inoculated.  Inoculated.  Oh, I can't.  I love watching this.  Look at these kids getting needles.  What? 
[02:40:30]  You little fucker.  I bet that hurts.  Dude, chill, man.  Oh, I'm sorry.  It's so funny.  They just played a whole montage of kids getting needles.  Good.  And they're all freaking out, and the needle hits them in the arm, and they just fucking  start crying.  Because it hits bone.  Oh, it's hysterical.  And I hope it's not even an inoculation.  I hope it's a drug of some sort.  Let's get this kid hooked on dope.  I hope those inoculations end like apocalypse now.  Jesus.  What is wrong with you, Phil?  A pile of little inoculated arms. 
[02:41:00]  Jesus Christ.  I laughed.  I cried.  I wept like a grandmother.  Like a grandmother.  Did you?  A little pile of arms.  Sweep them up, stupid.  I'd take two and pull my arms in my sleeves and hold them out like they were mine.  Look how little my hands are.  I'm rich, boss.  Oh, if I had one division of those men, my troubles would soon be over.  Chopped off some arms.  Oh, I love it. 
[02:41:30]  God damn.  That's the Bob Kelly animation.  That's the Bob Kelly animation.  We're just watching it.  We still got to get a winner for this contest.  We don't know which one to choose yet.  Oh, Jesus.  But go to the beginning where we start scolding Bob Kelly, basically, and he's trying to turn  to see where the voice is coming, but he has to turn his whole body.  Look how big you are.  And then he turns and has to move his eyes all the way to the side to see who's talking  to him.  It's a great animation.  It really, really is.  Bobby, we're doing a whole animation festival. 
[02:42:00]  More details to come, but we're going big time with this thing.  Now we're pushing it to May, by the way.  We want a solid two months of people working on their animations before we debut them at  a huge, huge venue.  Red carpet.  We're talking style on this one.  This is going to be a great Opie and Anthony event.  The Opie and Anthony animation festival, whatever we're going to call it.  Do we have any details today?  I know the prize money is going up nicely.  I think we're up to five G's at this point for the best animation.  Old school O&A tapes. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, that should be funny.  Yeah.  No, all the animations are unbelievable.  So anyway.  I think you can hear that one.  I just wanted to see the Fat Bob Kelly.  People will go check it out for themselves.  I am losing weight, though.  Fifteen pounds.  Cool.  Opie went.  No, I know.  It was like thinking about clapping and then, all right, he saw me get into the clap position.  I better just kind of give him a couple.  He gave me three.  I deserve three.  Can I ask, by the way?  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  Where's my hat? 
[02:43:00]  It was on the desk.  You've really been ragging about your hat.  I want my fucking hat.  What's his hat?  What hat?  What hat?  We're leaving CBS.  By the way, you're getting fucking fresh.  The interns come over, they're trying to help you, but there's fucking eight guys there.  It's like, you can't see your shit, so my hat is gone.  Where the fuck is Jimmy's hat?  Get his fucking hat.  There's your hat.  Oh, thank you, Iraq.  Anthony.  Appreciate it.  My apologies.  What the fuck?  He's got a car hiding.  What fucking hat, you cucks?  What kind of people are they?  We had to tone down the, which one are we playing now?  The team party pajama thing? 
[02:43:30]  We had to kind of tone it down for the other side of this radio show.  Oh, right.  But now we can get really dirty here.  So we're looking for hot teens.  A hot teen, hot pajama.  Let's go with hot teen, hot pajama party at Anthony's Mansion contest.  Not even a contest.  Promotion.  Right.  We're looking for hot teen girls, 18 or 19, that are willing to go over to Anthony's crib for a night.  We're going to put it on.  Would you actually do this one? 
[02:44:00]  I think you would.  Pal talk cameras everywhere.  I was going to answer and it's like, I think it would.  Pal talk cameras everywhere.  Everywhere.  So listeners from all over the world could kind of take a look at your hot teen, hot pajama party at your mansion.  What would it be?  Like sleeping bags in the great room?  Yeah, whatever.  In front of the fireplace?  They should have to wear panties and a t-shirt.  And you should have to wear, we should get you feetsy pajamas.  With rabbit ears.  A rabbit ears. 
[02:44:30]  Why would I have rabbit ears?  Legitimate feetsy pajamas though, at least.  And your cock should be poking out of the front but covered in saran wrap.  So it looks like a shiny fucking moist sausage.  You should have a flap in the back so they can fucking jam shit in your ass.  I'm not liking this.  No, they should take your Perrier bottle and stick it right in your ass.  This is my house.  I won't be able to walk around in it without thinking I got abused with a Perrier bottle on my ass.  That little flap in the back is the doggy door for their tongues to run into your assholes. 
[02:45:00]  You should put little treats in your asshole, little biscuits.  And that's what you do.  You don't even ask them by name.  You bend over and you go, here girl.  And then she comes over and she tongues out your fucking cheeks until you're done.  Yeah, Anthony, we're willing to do this, but one stipulation.  They have to lick treats out of your asshole.  That's all.  I don't see that working.  Anthony's balls smell like candy corn.  That would be like trying to eat gum out of grass. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, God.  With that, we play the dirtier version of the promo.  Do you look hot in pajamas?  Yes, I do.  Do you have abandonment issues?  Are you desperately seeking a father figure to make up for the daddy who left you long, long ago?  Then you're perfect for Anthony's Hot Teen Pajama Party.

I don't want that.  So tell them you're 58.  I'm not.  Shut up.  I'm not.  How old are you?  I understand the dramatic, funny thing with that, but fuck.  How old are you?  Don't be a party pooper, man.  I'm in my mid-40. 
[02:47:00]  All right.  Don't be a party pooper, man.  Chill.  Just go with it, man.  Me?  Who's talking?  Let's go with it.  Look who's talking, 30.

[02:47:30]  And that night you should have like a bake contest at his house.  Just like have the girls bake goodies.  I'm thinking a hot tub party next, too.  Who's going to have a hot tub, right?  No.  Pool party.  Pool party.  Naked pool party.  I'm having a pool.  Amputee naked pool party.  That means you have to have a fence put up if you're having a pool party.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, a big fence.  Why are you living next door to Luke Costello?  Luke Costello on one side.  Tommy Lee on the other. 
[02:48:00]  Oh, fuck Tommy Lee.  Yes.  Shit.  I was stumbling over my own tongue.  Shut her behind you.  Hey, I know you're a little worried about the hot teen hot pajama party because I know  a little bit about it.  You don't want the whole world knowing where you live.  Nick's got a great idea.  Oh, okay.  Nick in Cincinnati.  That's right.  He drugged them and dragged them by the twats.  Take a fistful of pussy lip and just pull them across the island.  Nick?  I was going to say, the best part about this whole promo is going to be the 15 hot teenage  girls blindfolded in a bus because they'll never let them know where you live. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah, that's what you do.  You meet them and have me in a bus.  Dude, this is a great idea.  First, they got to help me put a couch into a van.  No, but let's get Keith the Cop involved.  Dude, Keith the Cop involved.  You all meet at a mall and then everyone gets blindfolded for the ride to your house so  they don't even know where you live.  Yeah, I'm sure a police officer wants to be involved in this.  Rent one of those big party buses.  And everyone has to be blindfolded.  It's perfect.  Yeah.  Blindfolded.  Smoke out the window so even if they get free from the blindfolds, they can't really 
[02:49:00]  figure out where you're taking them.  Where does he live?  Area 57?  Dumb whores I'll never remember.  Yeah, plus it's long out.  You ever get a floor to give you directions?  You make a left at the thing.  The what, idiot?  The fucking retard home where you should live?  It's Area 51.  Whatever.  I think it's 57.  Area 51?  51 sauce?  Area 57.  There's just nothing going on there.  It's all Heinz flavors.  It is. 
[02:49:30]  Some guy Hank at the ketchup factory.  What a fucking...  I don't know, but there's something real secret going on about, I don't know, five or six  levels over.  They're making that special Heinz ketchup flavor and you see there's two guys jerking  off and shitting into a bag and draining a tampon into a Mexican with a shovel, stirring  it.  Hey, I like that guy who said, well, give me two times, get the placemask, get the placemask.  Bob Kelly, a lot of people saying UGG to you today because you suggested a baking contest. 
[02:50:00]  What was your contest, Bob?  A baking contest.  I guess that was a little faggy.  I didn't hear it.  I thought I just said that maybe you should have a...  Dad, you know what?  Baking is fun.  It's just tremendous.  You know what it really is that I actually got into it like I was going?  I know.  Charlie in Kentucky.  Charlie.  Charlie.  Yo.  What's up?  Hey.  Listen, I got a daughter for you.  She's about 18 and she looks pretty good and I was wondering if Anthony was interested  in breeding her. 
[02:50:30]  Breeding her.  Jesus.  Yeah, I'm looking to breed her out.  I'm going to need a good Italian stud.  Have Anthony breed your daughter contest.  Oh, there you go.  That, I'm sure dads will just be screeching their tires in front of the house, throwing  their daughters out onto the lawns.  I'm certain of it.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  We're going to take our first break because we got Sambo's and smoothies in front of us.  What do you got there? 
[02:51:00]  What do you eat?  I got an egg sandwich.  Egg whites and a little turkey.  Oh, and cheese.  Oh, motherfucker.  Motherfucker, where's Kenny?  Spanking time.  I didn't ask for cheese today.  No, you did not ask for cheese.  Is Kenny here so we could do a bare bottom spanking?  What's wrong with cheese?  What's wrong with cheese?  Not a bare bottom spanking with Kenny again.  You fucking made fun of my abs.  What do you think's wrong with cheese?  Oh, shit.  Goes right to your gut there, Bobby.  Oh, shit.  Metamuse in the house. 
[02:51:30]  God, dude.  Will you get your asshole away from me?  That's my new laugh.  Jimmy, I'm back on the Metamucil there.  Oh, me too.  Three days in a row.  And I got the unflavored version.  Have you tried that shit?  Orange only.  It's god awful.  I started gagging.  I think the psyllium husk I got, too.  They have orange and regular.  I tried the regular.  You gotta go orange.  You gotta.  The orange is a lovely flavor.  What are you guys taking? 
[02:52:00]  You can't shit regularly?  No, but it just makes you clean it out good.  Metamuse makes you shit good.  I literally shit every morning.  As soon as I take a sip of anything, it comes right out.  Dude, well, let me tell you what kind of shits I'm having now because of the Metamucil.  Yeah?  They come out like kind of like.  By the way, you don't know what a can of worms you open by mentioning shit.  Oh, boy.  You don't know.  Here we go.  No.  He's the Einstein of logs.  So my shit comes out about that in diameter.  Yeah.  Okay?  Really?  How big is your asshole?  That's not bad.  I'm squeezing it out.  Your fucking asshole will expand a little bit for you. 
[02:52:30]  That's not a big fucking diameter.  A little bit.  Don't make me look like I got a gaping asshole.  That's a mess of an asshole.  Not like the gaping guy with the four dildos in his ass.  He just sits on the toilet and the log just plummets into the wall.  From his stomach.  Sit, gloop, stand.  No push.  This is the beauty of the Metamucil dumps, by the way.  So it's about that diameter as it's coming out.  Because I have studied this.  About a silver dollar?  Basically a baseball bat you'd get at a Yankee game.  Not a silver dollar, you insane. 
[02:53:00]  Here, look at that, Bobby.  Not as big as this.  Look, Bobby.  Look at that.  Bobby, look.  Bobby, look.  Look, look.  Bobby, please look.  Quick, before it goes by, right there.  Bobby.  Bobby, look.  All right, now we've got to start the tape over.  You know the rules.  Bobby, you've got to look.  Bobby, please look.  Bobby's sticking dildos in his ass.  It's part of the story.  Now look again.  Just watch.  Watch.  Watch the whole thing.  Bobby, keep looking.  Bobby.  Watch this part.  Bobby, watch this part. 
[02:53:30]  This part.  Please.  No, right there.  Get it.  Oh, God.  That's what I want him to say.  Yeah, can you freeze frame that one part?  I can't.  I don't know.  Bobby, we have to start the tape over now.  Please look.  Bobby, please look.  Bobby, there's one part we want you to see.  That's easy.  You can do that.  That's easy.  Easy, easy.  No problem.  Come on.  Bobby.  Come on.  Now we've got to start it over again.  Come on, Bobby. 
[02:54:00]  We don't want to do this all day.  We freeze frame the part we want you to see.  Quick look.  To the right.  It's not that bad, actually.  For the fans.  Why would you look at this?  To the right.  To the right.  Oh, gosh.  Holy shit.  That is bad.  Oh, you okay?  Now you lost 17 pounds.  What was that?  His asshole?  Yeah.  He's right there.  That's actually a different shot.  Bobby, look. 
[02:54:30]  A different shot.  I can't look.  That's not his graphic.  Bobby, please.  Bobby, it's not his graphic.  It just shows you.  Hey, you made fun of my asshole.  I'm getting your back.  Now look at this gaping asshole.  That's a big asshole.  Look at it.  Shut up, Bobby.  Oh, God.  Take a look at it.  It's not bad.  Look.  Shut up.  Look, it's not bad.  Look.  I can't look at it.  Please, Bobby, for me.  I can't.  It's all over on every fucking screen.  And the other thing? 
[02:55:00]  I'm standing right there.  No, behind.  Ben, back.  All right.  Bobby, I'm in the middle of my shit story.  How am I supposed to jerk off when you're running out like that?  Bobby, sit down, please.  Jesus Christ, dude.  So anyway, so kissing the Metamucil.  Like this, Bobby, because I looked.  What's wrong, Bobby?  Bobby, what's wrong now?  All right, Bobby.  You all right there, Bob?  This guy's a fucking... 
[02:55:30]  Bobby, if you're going to puke, do it on mic.  You know the rules.  Jim.  And Jimmy farted on top.  What is this?  Well, it's a Metamucil house.  All right, I'm going to do this break with Jimmy.  This is fucking disgusting.  It's so fucking disgusting.  I'm looking at this bloody asshole.  And then he's going to add smell.  He's going to add another sense to this fucking hole.  Smell-o-vision. 
[02:56:00]  Listen to me.  So the Metamucil.  So they come out like this, Bobby, because I took a peek as they were getting ready to  drop.  And the beauty of Metamucil, as soon as it hits the water, they're like snakes in a can.  They go like this and blow up in the water and get very, very large.  I need some Gatorade.  Why Gatorade?  You didn't lose that many electrolytes for life.  Reflaces, electrolytes.  You're not in the Olympics.  Bob has Electro-Heavies. 
[02:56:30]  Bobby, now down to 17.  Congratulations.  Oh, I hope we fucking...  All right, we'll take a break.  Can you get a whiff of that fart?  Yeah, it's the worst.  Your asshole stinks.  Can we take a break?  Your asshole smells like his asshole looks.  Did you see the one?  You missed a couple.  Put that back on.  No, I'm not watching it.  Why did it bother you?  How do you have so weak stomach?  I couldn't smell it, but looking at it on a picture as a model.  Watch what I do.  I don't like assholes. 
[02:57:00]  Put it back.  Watch what I do.  That's what a man does.  That's right.  I'll jerk off watching this.  Watch what I do.  Add ketchup to that sandwich.  We'll see if you fucking need it.  Watch what I do.  Egg sandwich.  Put some ketchup on it.  There you go.  Look, watching the video.  The one asshole is...  I don't get why it's...  This is a good film, man.  What's the big deal?  Oh, God.  He's got two giant ones.  What's the big deal?  He's eating a sandwich, and Jimmy's jerking his cock.  The one shot, you gotta see.  It's not a red one.  Yeah, right, Jim.  I get it.  I already looked at it.  I'm all done.  He's sitting on a fire hydrant. 
[02:57:30]  Look at that.  Go fuck yourself.  Go to break.  Both of you.  Go fuck yourself.  Oh, God.  What is that?  What is that?  I fucking hate that.  It's funny that you guys giggle about this shit.  It's a man holding his fucking giant elephant asshole open, and you guys can't stop giggling.  There's something not wrong here.  What is wrong with us?  No, it's me.  No, it's me.  I'm fucked up, because I puke at that shit.  It's not you fucking three giggling cuts, laughing at it, eating sandwiches and fucking smoothies.  Yeah, but what's wrong with that?  What a tea party you guys have.  Look at how great it is. 
[02:58:00]  I can't eat fucking raspberry pie right now looking at that.  It wouldn't bother me.  Yeah.  Nothing bothers me.  I don't smell it.  Smell it.  It would gross me.  That guy has a big dick, too.  Oh, Jesus.  What are you looking at his cock for?  Just doing a fucking reframe.  Well, you're not a fucking...  It's not exactly where's Waldo.  You're not fucking CSI in a crime scene, you faggot.  His cock was huge.  He seems to be enjoying himself.  Well, he's having the fucking time of his life.  He's having a proverbial blast.  I told you.  I found a bag of dildos when I used to work with the retards. 
[02:58:30]  Did you smell them?  Yeah, sometimes.  Did you brush your nose against them?  Well, the guy that did...  I did a shift at another house on weekends.  I would do the overnight shift so the guy that lived there could actually go and do shit.  And he always used to keep the remote in his room.  He'd take the TV remote and bring it back into his room.  So I had a couple of my friends over from Boston, a couple of fucking total Boston fucking  Bobby came in, tough guys. 
[02:59:00]  We're over there watching TV.  The retards are asleep.  And I go into the room to find the remote because it's not in the TV room.  And there's a bag, a duffel bag of fucking dildos just open.  He had a Tupperware thing of lard.  Okay?  I bring these fucking bag out to the room.  Tupperware thing of lard.  And a fucking dildo collection the size of baseball bats.  One was like a fucking huge fist with the fingers curled up at the end.  Oh. 
[02:59:30]  He had a double fucking sided dildo.  And then he just had, it didn't even have like the shape of a cock.  It was just a fucking huge bat.  Like just like this big.  Just wanted a bat up his ass.  Just like a bat.  Like a rubber fucking bat.  That long, this big.  And he had a Tupperware thing full of lard.  Lard.  And there was like finger scoops.  Like we opened it.  There was like finger scoops out of it.  Oh, good.  Like three finger scoops.  How does that guy get his ass down on that butt plug like that? 
[03:00:00]  I just couldn't believe it, though.  Danny from Louisiana.  Danny, what's up?  Hey, everybody.  I just wanted to let you know the guys are watching gay porn in the studio.  Linger one day.  There you go.  Very nice.  Yeah.  Can we take a break?  Yeah, let's do that.  I hate that fucking.  Bobby, look at that one.  No way.  That's not even that bad.  It's a cone go.  No, I don't like when the fucking inner workings of an asshole.  I don't even like when you're seeing a chick getting fucked in the asshole. 
[03:00:30]  And her skin, the inside of her asshole comes back up.  A pink sock?  You don't like a pink sock?  No, no, no.  Who'd you vote for?  A fucking Gorbachev?  Communist?  I don't like it.  I don't fucking like a pink sock.  That's not a pink sock.  That's just a guy's ass.  He's not even opening it.  Yeah, it's a guy's asshole turned inside out.  I don't even like when the fucking pussy does that.  Leave it there.  That's not bad.  That's actually a weird one.  Yeah, Jim.  Look at this.  I got you up.  But look at it.  No, you're out of your mind.  Oh, wow. 
[03:01:00]  Derek said it looks like Hal from...  It's Dante's Inferno.  Oh, Hal?  I think he's in hell.  It's not that bad.  He can see it under the mud.  Overhead view of Mount St. Helens before it blew.  Oh, fuck.  I was right there with you.  Oh, God.  I can't look.  Molten lava.  That is fucking hilarious.  Molten lava.  You can see the hot magma.  How could you not laugh at that?  It's fucking hilarious.  I don't know, faggot.  No, but I don't hear a rhyme.  Oh, God.  I don't know.  There's something definitely wrong with me. 
[03:01:30]  I don't want to look at it.  You're just trying to shit out one of those little spares that come with your car?  Oh, and that's just fucking ridiculous.  That's disgusting.  It's like he just shoved raw chopped meat on his head.  He's actually the thing that makes the chopped meat as it's coming out.  The grinder.  The grinder.  Oh, that's horrid.  I thought when he shits, the whole sandwich just comes out the way it went in.  Or not.  Time for break, huh?  Time for...  Oh, God.  What a fucking... 
[03:02:00]  Where's Opie going?  Yeah, Derek, break.  We're going to go to the bathroom.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We don't know what the f*** we're doing.  All right.  We got finger 11 in the studio.  We can hear you.  Is that mic?  Did you try the mic?  Are we set up or...  It's supposed to be working.  Can you hear me at all?  A little bit.  Can you hear me only a little bit?  Yeah, you're picking up on the other mics, I think.  That doesn't sound good at all.  Is there a way he can give him a different mic?  That doesn't sound right. 
[03:02:30]  Anything work?  Does anything work?  Just play a guitar or something.  Just hit the...  That's sort of.  Hearing that a little bit.  That's coming...  That one.  Shut your mics off for one second and see if you hear these mics at all.  All right.  Just a radio show.  All right, ready?  Go.  One, two, three, four.  I knew this would happen.  We didn't expect this to work.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my dear sweet Jesus.  And this is not embarrassing at all to have a really big band in looking at us like we're  just douches.  But it was working. 
[03:03:00]  What the hell?  All right.  What else are we doing today?  A couple things.  We got Sam's wrestling promo.  See, you forgot to remind me.  I got it in front of me, though.  We got Once Upon a Potty.  We've never played Once Upon a Potty.  This might be the perfect crew for this bit.  And then we got Ellen and Heidi Klum talking about balls.  What? 
[03:03:30]  This kind of makes him and some likes black ones.  Bad day for the white man.  This was kind of funny.  Got to give credit to TMZ.  Are they calling today?  Tomorrow.  Oh, tomorrow?  Javi living.  Javi.  Well, uh...  That's fucking shister.  Here's a quick clip from TMZ.  Ellen and Heidi Klum talking about balls.  So, we make small and big balls.  Okay.  And which do you like?  Both.  Okay.  Great. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah.  Both.  You can put that ball in already.  Okay.  And it's hot.  As you can tell, it's steaming.  All right.  And I like them and they're really...  Oh, that's huge.  Well, you said it doesn't matter.  I don't know a lot about balls, Heidi.  You know, you should try them sometime.  You guys never try balls?  Oh, God.  Is this your first ball experience?  Well, no.  With me?  I can't remember.  It's been a while, so... 
[03:04:30]  Okay.  All right.  Before I...  Oh, boy.  ...completely...  Oh, no.  ...and utterly destroy this fucking studio...  ...it's going to look like when Kong had pictures taken of him.  I hope he's just going to lose his fucking mind and start throwing people...  Look, I've matured in my almost old age, and I'll give...  I accept one mistake a day now.  Not two.  I know we're going through a merger, and I know most people have pretty much given up 
[03:05:00]  like working.  Merger.  The two companies were dying, Sam.  They had to get together.  It was merger.  They gave Martha Stewart $2 billion, Sam.  And then they counted with Oprah at a quarter trillion.  It was a merger.  A quarter trillion.  Don Wicklund better fucking call Norton after the show, because he just saved probably 
[03:05:30]  $10,000 to $20,000 worth of equipment.  That's right.  By getting a quick laugh, just as I was ready to destroy.  Look at the phone with your baby blue eyes, Don.  Your eyes are bigger than Sam's genitals.  Oh, come on, quit.  Shut up, Sam.  You're Asian.  You had the genitals of a baby.  Oh, now I'm muted.  Great.  That's right.  Good cue.  The flow was just murdered. 
[03:06:00]  So what was the matter?  Yeah, there seemed to be a problem with the sound.  The bodies are piling up.  I have a members-only jacket and a flat-ass girlfriend and three lines.  I need a writer.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Already.  That's the one we like.  Yeah, we need that.  We need that player.  Oh, no.  That's never good for the...  No. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  What's that?  What happened?  That's the CD player.  Now it's busted.  That's too bad.  But it was working.  What just went wrong?  Oh, well, now it's not.  Oh, well.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my stepfather used to come home and my mother didn't have dinner ready.  Oh, wow.  But, but...  Oh, I don't know.  What does it matter?  Mars.  It wasn't the CD player.  I know, but something happened to the CD player.  It was the, um...  Oh, I don't know what happened.  I couldn't hear anything at all.  Oh, boy.  It was kind of crackly. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, it was crackly, so I just had to assume it was this.  Look, see, I fixed it.  See, look.  Well, maybe not.  See?  Uh, what else can I do?  Hmm.  Oh, boy.  See?  I fixed it.  Okay.  Give me some duct tape.  Hmm.  No, that was...  That ain't fixed, right?  No.  Oh, fuck it, man.  I think a gear broke.  People stopped working like a year ago.  Well, we don't stop working because the bile's...  I fucked up again.  I got over again. 
[03:07:30]  I was trying to say we don't stop working because the bodies are piling up.  I got to get out there and start solving some of these crimes instead of just, you know,  doing autopsies.  Wilmington Wow from Wackbag.  XM stock is dead, Sam.  It was...  Merger.  I don't need Wilmington's help.  I'll bomb on my own with my own three lines.  The stock was murdered.  I have kernel of corn teeth, Sam. 
[03:08:00]  There's 80 teeth in one quarter inch of space.  I chew very quickly.  He's a fucking kid.  He's a fucking kid.  God damn it.  That's right.  My girlfriend's on my houseboat.  She has an ass like a T-square.  I was burping.  Hey, let me tell you, queers.  I'm going to go with you, Detective Monaghan, and solve the murder. 
[03:08:30]  There's people shooting at me.  That never happens anywhere.  Who shoots at the coroner?  I'm 71 with a lump on my throat, but I'm fucking a hot blonde.  I might feel stupid after this phone call.  Paul on Long Island.  Paul?  Hey, what's up?  Oh, did you ever think that maybe the crackling sound was the balls cooking in the background? 
[03:09:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  They were cooking balls.  Because they were cooking, so it could have made a cooking sound.  That might not have been static at all.  But actually, audio, that was so clear, it picked up little sounds in the back.  Yeah, it was too clear.  That was so amazing.  Not good. 
[03:09:30]  Hey, let's talk about our potty experience.  Did you get potty trained growing up there, Bob Kelly?  I don't remember.  I don't remember, dude.  None of us remember.  Oh, crap.  You might need the CD player.  I actually was potty trained.  Oh, shit.  It didn't affect my sexuality.  That's going in there, right?  That don't look good.  That's tilted.  Don't try to put it in.  We could try maybe one of these.  What happened?  I think when you punched it.  When you punched it?  Back when you fucking treated it like Vicky LaMotta.  That's what happened.  Oh, man.  They're going to take this out of my salary. 
[03:10:00]  Oh, well.  Oh, well.  Oops.  There you go.  Wait, I might have fixed it.  You didn't.  You didn't fix it.  You made it worse.  It's never that easy to fix.  Like, high-tech electronic equipment with a clink.  Oh, boy.  Why don't you punch it again?  See if it goes back.  Exactly.  We're just threatening it.  Why don't you make it scared like you did all of us?  Look at Dan with his hand out. 
[03:10:30]  Here, unplug this.  Something's wrong with this.  I don't know what happened.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  This isn't good.  Now he's unplugging shit.  Oh, there goes the power cord and the little mic thing and the...  Oh, wait.  How do you get this on?  You got to unplug it.  You got to push the...  Why am I helping?  Mars, something happened to this thing.  Hey, Tom, bring a drink.  Something happened to you. 
[03:11:00]  My father used to always say, be a help, not a hindrance.  Mars, it was working when we first got here.  I don't know what happened.  I don't know what happened.  There you go.  Take that and see what's going on.  Get it fixed, Marcolino!  That's right.  What happened?  I just want to see if the thing's fixed.  Oh.  Sam is completely disgusted.  What happened to this fucking...  Wait a minute.  It's just...  It's just...  What happened?  I don't know.  People used to be running around. 
[03:11:30]  Hey, what happened?  Everybody doing shit.  That's right.  Dude.  I'm working on new laughs.  Dude, I remember.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  No, you know what?  He punched it, but it shouldn't have been working.  How much do those cost, do you think?  700.  240,000 dollars.  I would say that probably goes for 1,600.  No way.  Oh, shit.  What do you think?  You can get on eBay for six.  I'm willing to give $200 up for... 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  Manufacturer of the suggested retail price is...  The best part about that particular one is they don't make it anymore.  Yeah, they don't even make them anymore.  But it's something that you've...  You know, you enjoyed the particular eccentricities of that player.  And that's why you wanted it in here.  Yeah.  And they gave it to you.  And it was working.  And you just broke it.  You pretty much asked for a classic car that's not made and then just crashed it into a wall.  You do remember the pinball machine, so are you surprised? 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  Hey, you fixed it?  I got another one.  You got another one?  Are you insane?  Don't...  It's the last one ever.  I wouldn't do that.  It's the last one ever.  That's one on the face of the earth.  I hope he's just cracking FabergÃ© eggs.  But imagine this.  There's only two left in the radio world.  I broke one.  This one, more valuable now.  Ah, yeah.  You just made it more valuable.  Great point.  I'm a collector.  I understand that crap.  People buy shit and destroy them so their other copy is worth more. 
[03:13:00]  What's what happened to the Jews?  Oh, what do you mean?  Oh, what?  You know, Bob?  I don't know what he means.  Hey, let's do a potty talk, okay?  This is called Once Upon a...  Is this unhealthy?  I was potty trained.  My mother would sit me on the toilet and she would drink tea and scream, go.  And if I didn't shit quick enough, she would take my penis and put it between the toilet  seat and push down really hard.  And pinch the hell of it.  That's not good.  The most disturbing part is the tea part. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  You sit with tea and leave a lipstick print on it and scream, go, at the top of her lungs.  All right.  Here we go.  We got...  We're going to actually do material for everybody today.  Once Upon a Potty.  Once Upon a Potty?  Yeah.  We meet Joshua and his body parts.  Hello.  Oh.  Joshua.  Joshua.  This is Joshua.  Joshua is a little boy.  Just like all little boys, Joshua has a body. 
[03:14:00]  And this body has many nice and useful parts.  Yes, it does.  Oh, dear.  Very nice and useful.  Wow, young boy.  Yes, they have little parts, don't they?  Like young William.  Come with me, William.  Ten seconds without the music.  Very useful.  Eleven seconds.  Yes, very useful.  Parts, dear boy.  Why don't you come with me?  Leave the Jupiter 2.  Where did the music go? 
[03:14:30]  Wow, they suck.  I hope a dog dressed like a creature bites you.  See, that's what we had on the show.  Oh, dear.  Now I have no more material but music.  We can't get it together, can we?  Wow.  Yes, just keep turning it up and down.  You incompetent buffoon.  You clattering clunk of collisionous junk.  You bubble-headed booby.  I was talking about young boys. 
[03:15:00]  There he goes.  All right, shut the fucking things off.  Now I get to break something else.  The bit was murdered.  Where do I get to break now?  They were turning the volume up and down, Sam.  Even you and your tiny genitals would have done better.  That's right.  Perfect cue on the music for one line.  Now I have to stretch it.  Where the hell is Detective Monahan from?  That stupid Minnesota accent. 
[03:15:30]  He should be murdered.  Yeah, turn it down.  There you go.  I fucking love that.  That's the best.  I'm a fucking idiot.  Murdered.  Let's go back to Joshua.  A head for thinking.  Eyes for seeing.  And an ass for getting candy.  Ears for hearing.  A mouth to talk and eat with.  Hands for playing.  A penis for making wee-wee. 
[03:16:00]  Legs for walking and running.  And a body for seeing.  You forgot the little part, stupid.  And a little hole for making poo-poo.  That's how the tranny's talking to Jimmy.  The little hole for making poo-poo, Jimmy.  This thing has to have some bleeps in it.  I hear where the bleeps could go.  Oh, boy.  This could be fun.  There you go. 
[03:16:30]  Once upon a potty, we continue with this.  Joshua was very happy.  Oh, hold on.  This may be.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Ever since Joshua was born, he's been making wee-wee and poo-poo into his diaper.  Ugh.  Until one day, Joshua's grandmother bought him a big present.  Joshua opened the box and found something new and exciting inside.  Ooh.  Was it a hat?  It was grandma's uterus. 
[03:17:00]  No, it wasn't a hat.  She had a stroke and it fell out.  Was it a milk bowl for the cat?  No, it wasn't a milk bowl for the cat.  Was it a flower pot?  All right.  What was it, bitch?  No, it wasn't a flower pot.  It was a potty.  We're sitting on and making wee-wee and poo-poo into.  God, the one thing that's depressing the hell out of me is that little piece is well-produced. 
[03:17:30]  Yes.  It's clear as a bell.  Sound effects and poo-poo noises.  You can hear it.  There's no balls in the background being broiled by some dyke.  Nice mullet, cunt eater.  Joshua was very happy.  He sat on his new potty and sat and sat. 
[03:18:00]  And grandma played a joke on him and left the plunger in.  Joshua screamed and went to the emergency room and had little micro-stitches put in his bottom  while grandma giggled and yelled, I got him, and high-fived the staff.  Little micro-stitches.  And his little bum. 
[03:18:30]  While Nana screamed, metamucin house, and doubled over.  And sat, and sat, and nothing came out.  And sat in the potty and shed his pants.  Neither wee-wee nor poo-poo.  And then Nana said, you forgot to pull them down, stupid-o.  Retard.  Joshua was 37.  He wants to marry and cook his own dinner someday.  He has a huge tongue.  It's true.  He currently employs a stamp licker. 
[03:19:00]  He goes 8,000 at a time.  That fucking upside-down walk hairdo of Josh's is not a hit with the ladies.  His cock wound up in the potty like a cobra in a basket.  Nana brought Josh a big box.  It was a coffin.  She was trying to help me get in it.  So she could take the money he gets for his disabilities  and buy herself something she needs, like a young black dick. 
[03:19:30]  Wish I could have improv-ed something better than that.  Oh, shit.  Neither wee-wee nor poo-poo.  Later on, he made wee-wee and poo-poo.  Out of the same hole, because he's a bird.  And he made it all over Nana's windshield.  Nana is senile, and didn't realize that Josh is not a boy, but a pigeon.  And Nana's granddaughter turned out to be a toucan 
[03:20:00]  who pecked her clit until it fell off like a marble.  Nana tells everyone her grandchildren can fly.  And then the orderly rapes her with a pillow over her face.  All right, Jesus Christ.  The orderly who looks like Jim Jeffcoat from the Cowboys in 1988.  Oh, shit.  I can't even fucking breathe.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, shit. 
[03:20:30]  God damn it.  My grandchildren fly, Nana says, as the orderlies throw breadcrumbs to her grandchildren  and then kick them in the stomach.  Oh, fuck.  He made wee-wee and poo-poo, but not exactly into the potty.  Oh, boy.  But into the mouth of the German man, who had paid a lot of money for caviar party.  And then he shit in a pizza box for Uncle Eddie and Philadelphia. 
[03:21:00]  Oh, my God.  Josh made wee-wee and poo-poo, but not in the potty.  Oh, what a dope.  Josh is an idiot.  Oh, his stomach is killing me.  He's fucking killing me.  He's such a...  He's such a fucking ass. 
[03:21:30]  Afterwards, he kept making wee-wee and poo-poo into his diaper, and I kept changing him.  Oh, that's right.  There you go.  And then Nana said, I know how you feel.  The inside of my underwear always smells like a subway, and at my age, I should know better.  You're only one.  You have an excuse.  I've actually worked my entire life.  And now the toilet happens to be wherever I'm standing at a given moment. 
[03:22:00]  The world is my toilet.  Oh, and then Nana's hat was punched off by a black gentleman in Queens.  She refused to give up her purse, which had Josh's diapers in the mouth.  Oh, Nana couldn't get enough of that.  Until one day, when Joshua had a feeling that poo-poo was ready to come out, he ran to 
[03:22:30]  his potty and sat down on it.  And when he got up and looked into his potty...  It was filled with blood.  He had a miscarriage.  Josh is a retarded woman who had no idea that he was carrying a baby. 
[03:23:00]  Nana reached in and put on war paint.  This guy would be perfect for baby diaper mustache.  Baby diaper mustache.  Baby diaper mustache.  There we go.  You're killing me.  God damn it.  Into his potty, he saw all of his wee-wee and poo-poo right inside it. 
[03:23:30]  He was so happy, he picked up the potty and swung it around and got all the wee-wee and poo-poo  in the white shag rug.  And then he caved in Nana's head with it.  And that's how the police found her.  With a potty caving her head in.  Liquid shite in a white rug.  Joshua was very happy and proud. 
[03:24:00]  And came to show us his full potty.  And we were also very happy and proud of Joshua.  Stupid Joshua.  I don't know.  Get over it, kid.  Take a shit in the bowl.  Whenever Joshua has the feeling that poo-poo is ready to come out, he tells us that he has  to go, and he runs to his potty and sits down on it.  And we all sit around and watch him and masturbate, because that's how you healthily teet a child. 
[03:24:30]  We'll teach.  We'll teach.  We'll teach him out.  Prexel mouth.  You teet a child.  Teet a child?  Joshua remembers that it takes time for poo-poo to come out.  Ugh.  Just like it takes time to learn to use a potty.  Well, then maybe Joshua should stop swallowing gum.  He mistook the sit-and-spin for a potty and made spirograph shit all over the walls.  Joshua gets impatient, and sometimes he'll stand up and pull his pants off. 
[03:25:00]  And...  Hey, come on.  You were batting a thousand.  You were fucking batting a thousand.  I was going to say, Joshua gets impatient, and he'll stand up and pull his pants up and  break a log off in mid-motion.  So Joshua frequently shits on his belt.  Ah, shit.  Joshua is finding out that using the potty can be fun, just like the other things he can 
[03:25:30]  do all by himself.  Walking, talking, sitting, driving, and bilking Nana out of her life savings.  Bilking.  Bilking's a word.  It's a wonderful word.  How you sitting in the New York Times, uh...  Oh, man.  Yeah, the New York Times.  You sure it was Sudoku from a Friday's Placement?  Hey, that's not nice.  It's not about me right now, Bobby.  Talking, sitting, jumping. 
[03:26:00]  Clapping.  Singing.  Dancing.  And all the wonderful things he can do with his body.  Alright, we gotta, um...  Can we try the bleep game with this?  It might work.  Thank you.  Thanks, Dan.  Dan's very frustrated by me today.  See, look, it works.  Look, see?  Oh, don't hit it too hard.  What are you watching on there? 
[03:26:30]  Old school aerobics?  No, that's just...  Who's on there?  It looks like that.  Remember that old school aerobics?  From Showtime?  Yeah.  Where they'd be on a turntable?  Yeah, they'd just be spinning around.  Woo!  Alright, we're gonna do another break, and then, uh...  I'm gonna have to leave.  No, you...  Have to...  What?  I'm gonna go to the airport.  What time's your flight?  Seven?  No.  Oh, you get a little neurotic.  Kenny, does he really have to leave?  Yes! 
[03:27:00]  Immediately!  And look how short his sweatshirt is.  I believe you, I commented how fucking awful...  Hang your sleeves down.  Look at his belt!  Look at his fucking belt!  Dude, your sleeves and your jacket don't even come close to your wrist!  You're just like Herman Munster.  With, like, the clothes that it does to you, you're like,  Oh, ho, ho!  Eddie, you have to get to the airport!  Grandpa, bring around Dragula!  He looks like Herman when he had to drive his motorcycle.  Yeah, he put the big goggles on.  You are a ghoul.  You're like Herman Munster.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Oh, what's your guilty pleasure, by the way? 
[03:27:30]  You said, as soon as we get to XM.  Oh, 2 Live Crew.  It's, uh...  Actually, AJ Poopy shit's turned me on to my song,  Prancing Around to the Song.  It's 2 Live Crew, Pop That Pussy.

[03:29:00]  Oh, I bet  I can imagine  So you guys get to go to the airport  Jimmy's going to Cleveland  Anthony's going to Cleveland  Yes  For the sold out shows at the  House of Blues  You want to see Jimmy in Cleveland?  Yeah  Nice  Welcome  Hell yeah  I was just there, dude  I was there from Wednesday to Monday  I almost killed myself  I'm only going for Friday  He doesn't like it  I like Cleveland  The fans in Cleveland are great  But just downtown is fucking awful  He hates it  Why would you tell me  He's someone that doesn't like your town  He took the people for their money 
[03:29:30]  Pound for pound, you're better than him  Pound for pound, boxing analogy  Ironic for a fat man to be talking like I'm a boxer  Cleveland, I swear to God, is a very nice  The people, the fans, great  I feel like I'm looking into a mirror  Just downtown is fucking  I was walking around Sunday  It's scary  It's like a ghost town  Waiting for zombies to come out  You feel homeless  You feel like you're homeless  Yeah, it's almost like a  Bye, Jimmy  Oh, wow 
[03:30:00]  Look at Kenny getting uppity  Kenny, what's up?  No, I was just saying goodbye to Jimmy  I'll see you in a few minutes  Alright, Kenny  I'm having fun with the radio  Kenny, why the shorts  Kenny's like a wheel man in a robbery  Like, you'd make a good wheel man  Just pull the car around front  Okay  And then somehow you'd fuck it up  Guys come out with their dick in their hands  He'd also make a good donut  Like, if you open the fucking trunk  And lift that carpet  He's just curled up in a circle  What do you need?  That sweatshirt is just so small 
[03:30:30]  I know  Oh, no  You had to leave us with that one  I'm not  God, those stink so fucking bad today, Jimmy  Look at that  You're gonna be a treat on the plane  Awful appendix scar  Oh, God  Jimmy  When are you gonna be in Minnesota?  I'm doing one gig in Minneapolis  Actually, I almost sold out  There's probably 50 tickets left  When is that?  I do not  Kenny?  Get me that far? 
[03:31:00]  Jimmy  I think that's the show I'm gonna go to  If Anthony's going to Cleveland  I gotta go to one of these cities with Jimmy  I'll be in  Yeah  In Minneapolis  You're gonna come to Chicago  Chicago?  I would do Chicago  I'm doing two shows in Chicago  I'm doing Minneapolis  Saturday, March 15th  It's still too cold up there  But that is almost sold out  As is Denver, March 14th  Jimmy, you forgot a hunk of hair  In the back of your neck  You didn't shave  Oh, boy  You look like a burn victim  Where, Kenny?  Right in the back  There's a hunk of hair 
[03:31:30]  Kenny's laughing at us  Kenny never laughs  Why are you laughing, Kenny?  Of hair  That's cute  It is cute  It looks like somebody  Ripped all your hair out  Except for that white child  What the fuck do you do when I get back?  Leave it  Leave it  Leave it like you  I like your kooky eyebrows  I do too  Kooky  My chick hates him  But I tell him  Look at his eyebrow  He has like one hair  I beg for  I beg him to cut it  He won't  It's one that is way  Way longer than the rest  Einstein had that  My eyebrows were all over the place  Way longer than the rest  They're all over the place  It's awful 
[03:32:00]  It really is  They're all over the place  Like an antenna  Let's take a break  Say goodbye to Jimmy  Say goodbye to Club Soda Kenny  And have a good time at Cleveland  You know  Oh god damn it, Jimmy  That was from before, dude  No shit  Just worked its way over  What do you think?  It has the consistency of molasses  Yeah  Old glacier logs  That's what my nickname was  Like Joshua  Sometimes I realize it takes a while  Joshua  Joshua  Hello  Joshua  The only winning move  Is to not play  Shut up  I'm trying to computer 
[03:32:30]  Teach us a lesson  Why would a computer understand  What that means?  It wouldn't  Of course it wouldn't  Why'd you unplug the god damn thing?  You know  I was watching  The end of  Back to the Future last night  Oh what?  And realized  That fucking movie  Has so many awful things in it  That we'd never put in a movie  Nowadays?  Nowadays  Like what?  Like fucking rape  Is pretty much  Biff  Is raping  Marty's mom 
[03:33:00]  And you know  Then  McFly comes over  And punches him  That's why she got a shaky baby  Oh god  All that squirming  Affects the child  Later in life  It's like  Stop trying to look like  You're comfortable  We know what's going on  It's like  It's pretty much a rape scene  He tells his friends  Hey go on  Take him out back  I'll be 
[03:33:30]  I'll be  Done in like a minute  Or something  Or in a few minutes  Like he's raping  Or in the car  Yeah I know  Yeah yeah yeah  And then the other one  Where he calls  The black people  People spooks  Is this a scene  Where it's like  Hey  Beat it  Beat it  Spook  This doesn't concern you  Amazing  Spook  There's just a bunch  Of things in there  That are like  Wow  That's not really  A kid's movie  No one movie sucks  And then why would you  Have the guy  That like  Was trying to  Rape your wife 
[03:34:00]  Wax your car  Later on  Why wouldn't you  Why not  Yeah maybe  When he died  She'll be in the kitchen  He's like well you know  But then he says  He goes  Well you know  If it wasn't for Biff  We never would have met  That night  We never would have been married  It's like yeah  The guy was trying to  Fucking rape her  And you punched him  In the face  Jesus you cuckold  He really is  He probably  He lets Biff  Fuck her in the throat  A little too close  To his face  So it  Winks  Winks  Accidentally  Brushes his teeth  Alright  I came in her mouth 
[03:34:30]  Mr. McFly  Now Biff  You know you didn't  Come in her mouth yet  Oh that's right  I just fucked her  In the mouth  That's right  Let me kiss her  And make sure  You know  A good cuckold kiss  Look at  Look how  The lack of confidence  He had in the music  It's like he came up  Pulled it down  This would have been good  When we started too  But  Yeah well  Jesus  Those musical cues  Why are they coming in  So late  I don't know  I don't know  Aaron in Cleveland writes 
[03:35:00]  I saw Bob Kelly  Saturday night in Cleveland  Yeah  Fucker stared at me  Like if I didn't laugh  At his joke  He'd kill me  And if I did  He'd fuck me  God damn  Hilarious fat bastard  Bob Kelly's gonna be  At Bananas in  Hasbrook Heights  New Jersey  Friday and Saturday night  Friday and Saturday night  Friday and Saturday  All right  Back to the future  Yeah man  You're single  Why are you watching  Back to the future  I was going to bed  I was sleeping  It was on at like  You know  12 midnight or something 
[03:35:30]  A romantic comedy  I turn it on  I turn the volume up  I don't care  I'm wild like that  I'm crazy  You really are a nut  I'm crazy like that  Getting reports from the past  Maxwell's MySpace  Is officially  Trashed  Really  Yeah  Thank you Ryan in Cleveland  For that update  They're just fucking with him  What up  He'll learn man  And then don't forget  Get some audio by the way  Get some audio  While you're up there  Please  Oh yeah talk to Pete  I want to do that thing  No we're recording  True to board  Oh  True to board  True to board  True to board  Can we get the audience too

Fuck you, Benjamin Bornstein, a.k.a. Maxwell.  What's his MySpace address?  I don't know. 
[03:37:30]  Jim, it's Maxwell WMMS.  Is there an underline?  That's one word.  MySpace.com slash Maxwell WMMS.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Deadline of the day with Bob Kelly as these guys leave us.  Bye, guys.  Sweetie, look, I feel the ball.  You got to respect that.  Disgusting. 
[03:38:00]  Getting ready to wrap up the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Starting to get some interest in the animation contest that we're currently doing.  It's game on, by the way, to all the animators out there.  We got to just work out the details.  Dunn Wicklin calls and he's like, I want to do it at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Nothing against Hard Rock Johnny, but we can't do it at the Hard Rock Cafe.  We need people in seats focusing on the animations.  There's a theater right across the street.  We need some kind of a theater atmosphere that hopefully does serve beer because we do have a lot of alcoholics that listen to the show. 
[03:38:30]  And work on the show.  But the Hard Rock Cafe is more of a festive, that's like a road show, Halloween party, that type of, we'll be back there.  But we can't do it there.  We really need a theater.  We're thinking like a film festival.  Directors Guild right across the street has an awesome theater.  How many?  We're looking at, I was going to go Beacon, but a lot of people say 3,000 might be too much of a distraction.  So I'm thinking like 1,200 to 1,500 people.  That's it.  Only 1,500 people are going to be able to see this thing.  Well, what do we got?  Even thinking that many. 
[03:39:00]  That's a lot.  That's cool.  Yeah, that's pushing it, right?  That's cool.  Let's go with it.  I like saying the more the merrier.  Steve, what's your update?  Copywritten.  The update is I just stepped on.  I just got a mic.  I just got a mic.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Just had a conversation with Will and Don.  We're still talking venues.  We're talking dates.  We're talking men.  We're talking men.  Applause.  Did you have a conversation with Logan about a show date last night?  I don't talk to Logan.  Look at my fingers.  I am pointing.  I am now taking secret meetings around Manhattan. 
[03:39:30]  I'm taking everything into my own hands.  Are you Al-Qaeda?  Was there a secret meeting about the date of said events?  Now my hands are on my hips.  My hands are on my hips.  And I moved them because now I have to move them because I've been noticed.  Now I'm just gesturing.  I slap my hands.  Exactly.  Thank you.  The update is we're talking about dates.  Now I'm trying not to move them.  I'm holding up the Ten Commandments. 
[03:40:00]  I talk like I have grapefruits in both hands.  Yes.  That's what Jimmy says.  You look happier when you're not wearing black.  I don't.  Yeah.  Well, I shrunk my shirt.  I shrunk my shirt.  You shrunk your shirt?  We noticed.  Don't worry.  It's also sunny out.  And you grew your tits.  And you shrunk my shirt.  Oh, don't make fun of his tits.  No.  You should have seen what he used to look like.  I know.  He looks fucking great.  He looks fantastic.  Listen to Bobby.  This is how Bobby talks about guys.  You look fantastic. 
[03:40:30]  Fabulous.  You look fucking awesome.  Look at your hair cut.  You look fantastic.  Yeah, it did.  All right.  We'll be scrolling, scrolling.  He's scrolling.  He's scrolling.  Doing something for the third thing you guys are doing.  Now that Logan is going to, you know, well, what the fuck was that?  Taking things into my own hands.  We have a promo ready to go, but we're not sure about the date yet.  Okay, the date is now going to be May.  Good.  That's what I want to know.  We want to build this thing. 
[03:41:00]  We really want to have this thing take on a life of its own.  We want, like, trash talking among the animators.  Wow.  This fight's in the street.  Are animators like that?  Are they like rappers?  Oh, yeah.  They just get ugly.  They're a brutal bunch.  But this thing is definitely on.  It has begun officially.  We just got to get more details.  How much money we got so far?  Right now it's $2,500, but the money is coming in.  We could have up to $10,000 by the time this thing gets going.  But it's $2,500 right now.  $10,000 to win?  Well, we might split it up a little bit. 
[03:41:30]  No, no, no, no.  We're going to have about $25,000 to $30,000 of the best ones that come in.  And we're going to show them all.  Hopefully lots of laughs will ensue.  We're looking at a couple comedians.  Bobby, we'd love to have you on the bill.  I'd love to be there.  Do some time, you know, wherever.  Maybe a comedian to start the thing.  Maybe a comedian or two in the middle.  Have Rich Loss hosted this next cartoon?  Yeah.  You know what would be funny?  Let's hear it for all my warm-ups.  Let's hear it for me. 
[03:42:00]  Oh, it's a cartoon.  Bonnie, what I look.  And the jokes, people.  The jokes.  And then finally give out the top prizes at the end of the evening.  This thing, we're looking for this one to be a biggie.  You should do other awards, too.  Not just the top prizes.  You should do, like, you know, best, best, whatever.  Best sound or best fucking.  Oh, like the Oscars.  Yeah.  Best production value.  Give a couple awards up.  Has anyone ever been to a film festival?  Don't they give out weird awards?  They give out weird awards.  And then they give out the final three. 
[03:42:30]  It could be the winners.  The runner-ups.  And then the actual winner who wins the money.  All right.  I mean, we're going to take our time with this.  Have comedians actually do the intro.  Like, have you guys come out and introduce an award.  Patrice can come out.  We'll easily MC the whole thing.  And then maybe have, like, guest judges like yourself and other people.  Wow.  And we're going to, I mean, we're really excited about this.  We're going to take our time.  But it is officially on.  We'll get a venue very soon.  And we'll get an official date very soon.  Probably early to mid-May, I'm thinking.  Yeah.  Is when it finally all goes down. 
[03:43:00]  We're looking mid-May.  And we're talking about venues.  And we know the size.  We're just trying to figure out how to get a reason.  Well, to 1,500, I think, we'll do fine.  I really do.  Because when we were showing the animations at the Virus Tour, and in some cities we were  up to, what, 10,000, 11,000 people, they all sat quietly and really, really enjoyed them.  So I think we could do okay with a bigger venue.  Yeah.  Because some people were saying, keep it to 500.  I'm like, no fucking way, man.  I still want 3,000.  I want the beacon.  I want the beacon.  The big one.  You get the press down there. 
[03:43:30]  A little red carpet.  We're going to do a little red carpet.  Oh, red carpet.  Yeah.  Do a little red carpet.  Do the press.  Yeah.  People will dress up like the characters in the animation, maybe.  And the people in the animation, like you, you know, you'd be like, hey, look at that.  Look, there's Fat Bob Kelly.  Fat Bob Kelly.  By the way, maybe I'll be Skinny Bob and there'll be another cartoon.  What the fuck year are we doing this?  Fucking catch AIDS.  I really am.  I'm just going to go fuck a Brazilian hooker without a condom in the asshole.  Again.  Suck her boyfriend off and let him come in my teeth, my open wound in my tooth. 
[03:44:00]  Just floss before I suck his cock.  People are saying simulcast at an XM.  We're talking about that.  I don't know if...  It's a film festival.  Yeah.  I know.  That's the only film.  What the hell are you going to do?  Maybe we could film...  I don't know.  We'll figure out some shit.  We'll figure out some shit.  Because a lot of people are not going to be able to see this.  I understand that.  We should podcast it.  But then all those animations are going to end up online.  And then we'll videotape some stuff.  We'll put that online in case you missed it.  But don't put them online before we have a chance to judge them. 
[03:44:30]  We're going to ask you to mail them in.  Well, you're just going to fuck your own chances if you spread it around before the contest.  Because if a lot of people have seen these videos many times, you're not going to get the reaction you're hoping for.  And the other thing is that we're going to need all animators to actually mail it through the post office to Steve.  So we get bigger files and all that.  Yeah.  These things are going to be up on big screens, so web quality won't work.  These things actually need to be, you know, large files on DVDs.  Right. 
[03:45:00]  That's so...  TV quality.  Hey, where do people...  Thank you.  Steve, where do people go for all the updates on this thing?  Opeinanthony.com.  And I'm going to change the date as soon as I get out of here.  Yeah.  So it's going to be somewhere in May.  Early to mid.  This could be like an annual thing.  I'm hoping.  It's going to be a big thing.  Big.  It'll become like...  Yeah.  Like Tribeca.  We're very excited about this one.  It has to be...  Are there rules, though?  Yeah, we're working on some rules here and there.  Yeah.  But have you seen some of the animations from the contest that we kind of just threw out  there for a week or two?  Yeah.  In two weeks, we got some amazing stuff. 
[03:45:30]  Yeah, really good animation.  Amazing stuff.  All right.  With that, let's go to line of the day.  SkiColoradoNow.com for info on great deals and 26 world-class resorts and up-to-the-minute  snow conditions.  Log on to SkiColoradoNow.com.  Thank you.  Someone paid for that.  What happened?  That's just funny.  You just fucking just mailed that in.  Somebody paid for that.  Mailed it.  Somebody actually had to work eight hours a day for two months to pay for that. 
[03:46:00]  You know how lucky they should be knowing that I just mailed that in to them?  Yeah.  Into the...  Whatever.  Runner-up line of the day.  Cancer benefit.  Yeah, that's not a joke.  All right.  Let's not help them pick up their wigs.  Here, let me get that for you.  Show them you're a gentleman.  Where's Norton's bra?  I screwed up.  A bra filled with toilet paper.  I called.  God damn.  Hey, very good, Bobby. 
[03:46:30]  What is iClips about?  Because someone's saying we should simulcast or stream it live on iClips or something.  That's not a bad idea, though.  Yeah, we should do a podcast of it or something.  Somehow stream...  Hmm.  Absolutely.  If I stream my wedding from Hawaii, you guys can do it.  It would be a shame if the rest of the country and the world at this point doesn't get to check out the festival online.  You can stream it.  Maybe we stream the animations or something like that. 
[03:47:00]  Stream the whole thing.  The whole thing?  You set up two cameras, one camera, just right at the stage.  And I don't want to have to worry about making it sound good for the radio.  That's the only reason why we don't want to do the broadcast, because it's so different.  Because now you have to start thinking about what they're hearing at home, and it's so distracting when you're trying to entertain people live.  Camera guy's just going to put a mic on the stage.  And do that?  Okay.  And that's it.  And it goes right to the camera.  All right, Steve.  New angle.  Well, we want to stream it on the internet for the people that aren't lucky enough to get a ticket to the animation festival. 
[03:47:30]  Very good.  All right.  Runner-up line of the day.  Here's another one.  Have you ever had hot stones rubbed all over your naked body?  The stone massage you should have is the same one they give in Iraq.  Steven asks from Bayshore.  Hey, can you ask Blob to go outside and smile for the Google girth satellite?  This way we have an updated pic to work with.  This is what really kills me.  Is I'm not the fattest guy on this show.  Steven asks from Bayshore probably weighs the same as you.  And he's making blob jokes. 
[03:48:00]  Most of these fatos are just as, if not fatter than me.  Go fuck yourself.  Hey, leave them alone.  You're right.  I love them all.  All right, good.  Whatever happened before the very first fire show stop in Worcester?  I remember the cameraman.  I have no idea what that's about.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Biff is raping Marty's mom.  And, you know, then McFly comes over and punches him.  That's why she got a shaky baby. 
[03:48:30]  Blue Healer from Kentucky.  Fuck it.  Make it an HBO special.  Steve, new update.  HBO special.  HBO special.  Sorry, Anthony.  The Animation Festival live on HBO.  When are we going to go legit?  You are legit.  Fuck no.  I want to go legit.  You just film this every day and put it on Spike TV.  Yeah, we need someone that could work out deals for us. 
[03:49:00]  We lost Anthony.  That means someone's showing their ass somewhere.  Exactly.  Why is he hiding everything, too?  I'm not hiding everything.  You got a thing up here.  Cock blocking the camera.  Let me see some stuff.  Cock blocking anything.  It was line of the day.  Don't we have a video to do?  When Anthony goes very, very quiet and sounds like I'm just doing a show alone, all that  means is he's looking at someone's ass on Pal Talk.  No, I'm...  And it's basically saying, fuck the listeners.  Fuck the radio show.  This ass is fine. 
[03:49:30]  No, it isn't.  He's typing with one hand so he can still look at me.  I'm texting because I get a few texts that I have to do.  My favorite part of the show is looking at Anthony and going, oh, no, he's not paying  attention.  That's always good.  Yeah, what's the matter?  Little Jimmy leaves and you can't fucking stay part of the track.  I've been single for a week.  Could you cut me some fucking slack?  We're trying to.  We're trying to be your friend.  Yeah.  He keeps shutting the door on us.  Yeah, we're really pissed.  Open up.  I told Anthony during the break because he's asking questions.  He says, we're asking questions.  I'm like, look, we're just trying to be your friend.  I figured after 14 years, I would finally get to know you. 
[03:50:00]  Remember for the first 12 years, we made believe we were best friends hanging out  all the time?  Jesus.  What's that, Dan?  I think Ant said something about, like, will you stop asking questions about my life?  Yeah.  That's what friends do.  That's what friends do.  Yeah.  We had everyone fooled that we were, like, the best of best friends.  Yeah.  I want to know something about you.  It's been 14 years.  Give me something.  Noodle 63.  Open up.  It's in very...  Open up.  Open up.  No, it's just a very odd time in my life right now that I'm not ready to open up to. 
[03:50:30]  But...  Yeah.  It's called a midlife crisis.  No, it is not.  There it is.  You fucking...  Oh, fat.  Really?  Fast cars, video games, losing your chick?  Really?  That's not a midlife crisis?  It isn't.  It's a...  I don't know what else is.  Oh, God.  It's not like everything's going great and you have a direction in life.  You fucking...  What am I doing?  You're doing nothing.  We're in the middle of a show.  You totally disconnect from us and you're not even... 
[03:51:00]  I can't help it.  But you're texting and you're not even...  I have to.  Put the fucking cell phone down.  I have to.  Thank you, Bobby.  It was the end of the show.  I want to say something.  I didn't know how to bring this up on the show.  Thank you.  He's texting and we'll get a pal talk.  All right.  Look, you know what you should do?  And I'm sitting here doing a monologue here, Henry.  Well, you know what?  That's what you should do.  You should actually paint yourself silver and pretend you're a fucking robot and maybe he'll enjoy your company.  Because apparently the only way he opens up is through texting and video games.  Look, you techno nerd.  All right.  I needed a little intervention there. 
[03:51:30]  I'll admit to that.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you for bringing it up and intervening in that because I was shirking my responsibility in favor of my personal life,  which I should wait until 11 o'clock.  Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station.  Anthony retired a year ago.  All right.  He really did.  All right.  It's 11 o'clock.  Show's over.  Go fuck yourselves.  Get the goddamn camera crew in here.  We're busy men. 
[03:52:00]  We film and we get the fuck out.  They got five minutes to get our pretty faces.  Steve, are they ready to go?  Anthony retired.  All right.  We're doing it live.  Let's go.  This is how we do it.  Give me the fucking script.  Give me the camera guy.  Let's go.  Are we up to line of the day?  Runner up line of the day.  The last one.  Get the camera crew in here.  He fucking picked up the placemat and he folded it the way someone does a newspaper and he  carried it under his arm.  Like a gentleman.  Reading it on the train.  He was taking a shit reading it. 
[03:52:30]  Cross-country flight.  He's only halfway through the placemat.  Very funny.  Hey, a new idea from the listener.  You guys are too fucking mine.  What was just played on the air, Anthony?  The line of the day.  What was it?  It was the one where...  What was it?  Exactly.  What was it?  It was the funniest line.  What was it?  That was said all day.  What was it?  It was the one where...  What's Opie's middle name?  It was that one. 
[03:53:00]  Edward, but it's not official.  Keep it under your hat.  Keep it under your hat.  Dude, that was the runner-up line of the day.  Yeah.  That's why I'm waiting for the here.  It comes line of the day.  Line of the day.  That was line of the day and the funniest line of the day.  It doesn't listen.  Thank you, Bobby.  Thank you.  Bobby.  You're outreaching.  Now fucking Bobby is like Spider.  Now this is...  I'm just saying.  Now that this is out in the open, I'm going to sleep much better at night.  Thank you, Bob Kelly.  All right.  I just had a right.  Like, yeah.  I...  You have nobody.  They're on to me. 
[03:53:30]  You have nobody.  Who are you texting?  They're all gone.  You live alone.  Are you texting your guns?  Everyone gave up on you.  Even your cat.  Oh, Jack Jack would still like me and know me.  Do you have a cat?  I did.  Oh, she took the cat?  Well, yeah.  Did you give a fuck?  Little Jack Jack.  You didn't care, did you?  No, I like little Jack Jack.  Did he shit in the house?  He was cool.  No, he was very clean.  Really?  Yeah, he went on the toilet bowl.  What the fuck do you think he shit?  He shit in a cat box, but...  You can let it outside, you moron. 
[03:54:00]  It's not like a fucking bird.  Is the camera crew ready?  No, he had his own little wing.  The guys are ready.  Oh, yeah?  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  I just want to make you knew that this is getting cut up for spots, so...  What?  Yeah, I know.  We're going to give him a good read.  Watch.  Okay.  We don't hide shit from the listeners.  They know we're product whores.  I mean, welcome to this fine studio of our set.  Yes.  In the suit.  Of course.  Hey, CokeLogic writes, I want to start campaigning for which city Opie visits on Jimmy's Comedy Tour. 
[03:54:30]  Come to Chicago.  We'll go for beers after the show.  That's what I'm doing.  Because Anthony, because he cares about Jimmy's Comedy, is flying to Cleveland tomorrow.  What do they have in Cleveland besides Jimmy's Comedy?  I'm saying Jimmy.  Look, a guy that refuses to go to a screening that will help the radio show that's two blocks  away has decided to fly to Cleveland.  I have...  I have...  That's good.  Look.  Look.  Look, we're tearing down all sorts of walls. 
[03:55:00]  I have nothing to do.  The guy that doesn't have time for an after-show meeting has decided that.  He's flying to the wonderful city of Cleveland.  Jimmy is in Cleveland.  There's a snowstorm.  Right.  There's a middle of the place.  And the debate just left.  It's going to be fantastic up there.  Jimmy is in Cleveland.  And I decided I want to go see Jim Norton.  And I'm going to go see Jimmy Norton.  Yeah, that's good.  Cleveland.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's good.  Hey.  That's good.  Why don't you miss him while he's in Palm Beach? 
[03:55:30]  Listen, so that's a good idea.  Jesus.  I will go to one of the cities that Jimmy's performing in.  Oh.  That's cool.  Yeah.  I think I want to go to Chicago.  I've never been to Chicago.  But I've never been.  You've never been to Chicago.  No, I've never been to that in the winter.  Chicago's better than Cleveland in the winter.  Yeah.  Not really.  I just found your lead.  You like going to these winter cities in the middle of winter.  So why shouldn't I?  Yeah.  Why don't you go to Wichita next?  Yeah.  Anthony.  How's that?  How about Nebraska?  You know that Jimmy.  Hold on.  I got something for Anthony. 
[03:56:00]  All right.  And here's the other thing about Anthony in Cleveland.  He hates winter.  Hates the cold.  That's why we stopped doing the walkover.  Because Anthony hates cold.  What is he?  The outdoor shell?  He's playing inside.  All right.  How about this?  I'll really help you out.  All right.  This weekend, Cleveland.  Next weekend, Atlanta.  Ah, see?  They call it Hotlanta.  That is nice.  Why not go there?  Why don't you go there?  I could.  I might.  Why don't you go to Alden?  Hey, why don't you open up?  And become his friend and go to all of them.  You go to every one of his shows? 
[03:56:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wouldn't mind doing that.  Jimmy's very funny.  It's fun to go to shows that he does.  So why not?  Do it.  I was.  I got.  Maybe it's nothing to do.  Maybe it's the new Anthony.  He cares about Jimmy.  Yeah, he's got nothing to do.  Jimmy, the show.  Why don't you and Opie go together?  That'd be cool if you guys see.  That's like a friend thing.  Like you meet at the airport.  Have you ever done this?  Where you actually meet your friend at the airport.  And you take a flight together?  Bobby, that would take up. 
[03:57:00]  That would mean a phone call to the person.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  What?  I was as surprised as everyone when he announced today or yesterday that he's going to Cleveland.  Going to see Jimmy Norton.  He's playing at the.  I want to know who's in Cleveland.  The House of Blues?  What else is working out there?  Right around Christmas, you know, take the guys out for burgers.  He didn't have time for that, but he's going to Cleveland.  I'm taking the guys out to Rue.  Many times.  We've enjoyed chicken at all.  It hasn't been lately?  No.  I've been busy. 
[03:57:30]  It's been over a year, pal.  Yeah, you've been busy.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  There's so much going on at that empty place you live.  All right.  Hey, here's your line of the day.  I'm going to pay fucking attention.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Pay attention.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Later on, he made wee-wee and poo-poo.  Out of the same hole because he's a bird. 
[03:58:00]  And he made it all over Nana's windshield.  Nana is senile and didn't realize that Josh is not a boy, but a pigeon.  And that's how you executive produce.  Yes.  Why didn't you laugh at that, sir?  Oh.  I didn't find it funny.  It was out of context, so he didn't know what we were talking about.  You didn't find it funny?  I wouldn't either.  It was good.  Solid.  Perhaps.  He didn't know.  It wasn't in context of anything.  Oh. 
[03:58:30]  I was daydreaming.  Can I leave?  See?  No.  You can help us with that.  I need to leave.  He was texting.  I don't want to be here when something else gets broken.  I have issues.  So what are we doing today?  Yeah.  What are we doing?  Do you want to be here?  Yeah.  Okay.  Heck yeah.  Wow.  All right.  Are we white balanced?  Did you white balance the camera?  Are we ready to go?  Are we taping?  What are we doing?  What is this?  Interview.  Interview.  Okay.  Interview.  What's going on here now? 
[03:59:00]  It's really the end of the show so we can talk about it.  I have an audition.  Why don't we just do it?  Oh.  Why don't we just do it on the air?  He hates you.  Wait.  I got to communicate.  Will you stop, please?  Oh.  Oh.  Will is going to get smashed if you put.  Wow.  Last time I saw Steve make that face is when some girl was showing him his pussy.  Her pussy.  No.  No, no. 
[03:59:30]  We learned.  We're straight.  It was a great show.  All right.  We're going to leave.  It was a great show.  Hey, Bobby, you're going to be at Bananas in Hasbrook Heights, New Jersey, Friday and  Saturday night.  Friday, Saturday night and April 8th, new CD, DVD comes out through Comedy Central.  Really fast.  We got the guy that made the fat Bob Kelly animation.  His name is Rat T.  Rat T, what's up?  Hi.  How you doing?  Good.  I just wanted to beg Opie to announce the winners at some point for this first contest 
[04:00:00]  so those of us who entered the contest could be enthusiastic for the second part.  Well, the second part is the biggie.  I forgot.  We were supposed to announce the winner today, I guess.  I think it's between.  I think.  I don't know.  There's four really good ones.  One of the Jimmy's glasses is really funny.  The 50s thing is really funny.  The one where they're drilling through the mountain.  That's really funny.  But the fat Bob Kelly makes me laugh.  The animation on that is really, really good.  Yeah.  And then you got the puppet show, which is really funny. 
[04:00:30]  I think it's between those four, but I'm not sure.  Would we agree?  Or is there another one I'm forgetting?  I'm going to have to review them.  Yeah, we'll do a quick review for tomorrow.  Yeah, we'll finally get the winner of that so we can move on with the real contest, which  has already started, sir.  Are you going to work on another one, do you think?  I'd love to.  I know what I'm planning.  Can you do me sink fucking and make me thinner with hair?  Sorry, Bob.  That's all right, buddy.  You did a great job. 
[04:01:00]  Opie, you're the biggest dick, Ant, and Jimmy carry you.  Chill the fuck out.  Wow.  All right.  I'm sorry, sir.  Jesus Christ.  What the hell is that?  I don't know.  What is wrong with these people?  We finally get to throw Anthony under the bus and someone is a little sensitive out there.  He's like Barack Obama.  Why don't you get him a pillow to make sure he's comfortable?  This fucking guy is untouchable and it's time we touch him a little bit.  Oh, he's touchable.  I know.  He's touchable.  Look at him.  He has to sit there with a big can of Lysol.  Bobby gave me an intervention.  All right.  I hope it helped.  Hey, the other thing about the animation contest, you could pick any bit. 
[04:01:30]  We're going to put up a whole bunch of other ones to choose from, but then you could go  on your own and find other stuff to animate.  All right.  I'm now sad.  Shut it off.  I'm really sad because there's a person that thinks that I suck on the show.  What happened?  We were all getting along.  All right, Bobby.  Not everybody's good.  Opie?  Opie?  What?  G-H?  Yeah.  Hoping for the compliment right here.  You know what, bro?  Not everybody's going to like you. 
[04:02:00]  Give me a compliment.  I need it now.  You look great.  Your haircut looks awesome.  You don't look like you're going through a midlife crisis.  Like someone else?  Hey, what the fuck?  No, I'm not saying anybody else.  Wait, shut up.  It's about me now.  It's about you.  You look like...  Here's the voice.  Like you're trying to pick me out.  You know something.  You look great, dude.  You look fantastic.  You don't look like you're a colonel in the National Guard in 1978.  Stupid fucking musketeer facial hair. 
[04:02:30]  Be careful.  They're going to hate you now, too.  They're going to hate you as well.  What are you doing?  But I think you're doing great.  And fuck that guy.  You know what?  Fuck him.  Don't even look at that stuff.  Some people like you.  Some people hate you.  But you know what?  Together, you, Jimmy, and Anthony, and even Than and Sam and Dan and all the other fucking  creeps you have here, together, you make a fantastic show.  Together.  Thank you, Bobby.  Together.  This guy doesn't think so. 
[04:03:00]  It's like fucking Legos.  Yeah, he's a busy man.  I'm busy under the table.  Yeah, he's got things to do.  The guy's got a bunch of paperwork in front of him.  That helped me.  Thank you.  Thank you for that, sir.  And you're dating a fucking 20.  Somebody way out of your league.  You're old?  What?  I mean, you're dating.  Am I almost in her league?  Well, yeah, money-wise.  I don't want to be in her league because I have money.  Your bank account is in her league.  Oh, and then he puts him right back where we started.  No, no, no.  You know she's not like that. 
[04:03:30]  She's gorgeous.  God bless you.  Am I almost in her league?  Yeah, you're almost in her league.  Am I kind of like the...  Yeah, you're like double A.  Like double A?  Triple A?  Triple?  Triple?  You're about to go pro.  You're about to go pro.  All right, she's like...  Let's say she's the Roger Clemens in his prime.  No, let's just say something else.  What am I in that same league?  What am I in that same league, Bobby?  What am I in that same league?  I would have to say you're probably...  Hmm.  I don't know.  You're a Timlin.  Maybe a Wakefield.  But before his knuckleball really came into play. 
[04:04:00]  Sometimes you work.  Sometimes you don't.  It depends on the weather.  All right, we got to take a break.  A break?  End the show, I guess.  Yeah, it's a break for the day.  We should take a break and just come back real quick.  By the way, the only reason I'm listening to Steve today is because I ruined one of Will's  clients yesterday.  So I can't do it until I'm two days in a row.  Can't do it twice.  The only reason.  You'd be very angry.  I have a little bit of a soul left in this body. 
[04:04:30]  Very.  I'm going to the gym right now.  Very little.  I'm not Tim Tuffel, you fuck.  Tim Tuffel.  From Philly?  She's a Hall of Famer and Opie's Tim Tuffel.  Tim Tuffel.  I'm from Philly.  I remember that guy.  All right, end this.  We got guys to talk to.  No, you want to end it so you can go back to looking at broads and pout talk.  No, no.  Because I got...  I really...  I got to get a haircut.  Really?  Where do you got to get a haircut?  You can't...  You're not going to a fucking super cut off of some highway in Long Island?  No, no.  There's a...  Can we get a haircut together? 
[04:05:00]  That would be a nice little bonding thing.  No.  Maybe we get hot shaves together.  Me and you are going to start hanging out.  This is true.  The girl that cuts my hair.  After 14 years, you and I are going to start hanging out.  There's a girl that cuts my hair.  Her name is Dawn.  And she is moving places.  Big boobies?  No, she's got a boyfriend and everything.  She just cuts my hair.  She cut my hair for a while.  But you do have a fantasy about her, though.  No.  Secret fantasy.  No.  Every guy wants to fuck his hairdresser.  Yeah.  There's 8,000 jokes there for him. 
[04:05:30]  Yeah, no kidding.  Every guy who gets his hair cut, while you're in the chair, you're actually thinking that  she kind of digs you.  No.  She kind of digs you.  No.  It's not like that.  All right.  Does she do it?  I just need to, you know...  Okay, go ahead.  Here's a mess.  If my girl is Roger Clemens, Opie is the rusty roids needle he's stuck in his ass.  That's really not nice.  Oh, wow.  That's going a little too far.  That's mean.  I fully expect it from Pittsburgh.  That's really, really mean.  Thank you, dunking booth douche. 
[04:06:00]  So you're getting a haircut.  Yeah.  Haircut is slang for jerking off on Pal Talk.  Thank you, Gino.  Get out of here.  Now we know.  Yeah, you really...  I can assure you, I would...  Here it is.  Uh-oh, the camera guy left.  I swear on...  Did we just ruin the whole thing?  Is it off?  Oh, boy.  Oh, they're whispering.  Oh, my God.  There's a huddle.  It looks like a huddle.  It's a definite huddle.  Stan's over there.  Why is Stan over there?  Oh, they want it wrapped up.  They want it wrapped up. 
[04:06:30]  Listen.  Yeah.  Listen, do what you take.  Opie's girl is Roger Clemens.  Opie is Jim Abbott and his gimp arm.  But, see, these guys love me out there.  They do love you.  They love me.  That's what they do at this show.  People don't understand that they actually smash you because they love you.  Yeah.  If they didn't smash you, that means they don't give a shit about you.  Yeah.  Right?  Hey, old man, I'm talking to you.  Oh, hi.  What?  Jesus.  Opie, seriously, ease up on Ant and stop acting like you know comedy.  You over set up bits.  You kill the funny every time.  See?  Jesus Christ. 
[04:07:00]  It continues.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm going to have to go back to my multi-million dollar pad and cry a little bit today.  Oh, geez.  Because that one actually got to me.  That one's going to hurt a little bit.  You know what?  How are you going to let this guy hurt?  He's in a basement somewhere.  It hurts, Bobby.  He knows it hurts.  And I know it hurts.  Why don't somebody call up and say something nice to Opie?  No.  Because we got to go.  Dan, what happened?  Dan jumped ship.  It's all good?  They got to go.  You got to wrap it up, dude.  These guys are getting impatient.  They got stuff to do.  Are they yelling at you?  No.  Just couldn't think of a better way to end the show than me saying we should end the show. 
[04:07:30]  Yeah.  Got to wrap it up, Bo.  All right.  We're going to wrap it up.  Let's wrap it up.  Just waiting for one.  Wrapping it up.  Just waiting for one call to say something nice to me.  Just going.  Hey, Opie.  Just going.  Anthony, do what you're told and wrap up the show.  Oh.  Hey, we will see you tomorrow.  Ah.  On, um.  No, that was the out.  Yeah, I know.  That was the out.  Okay.  I gave you a nice out.  Thanks for tuning in, Opie and Anthony Show. 
[04:08:00]  We will see you tomorrow.  What is this, a podcast?  Oh, you stepped on it.  Yeah, you really did.  Sorry.  One call.  Just one.  No.  We got things to do.  Holy shit.  Look at the time.  We got one coming that says, I almost like you.  Shit.  11-16.  I just need one.  Just one.  There's a call that says, I love Opie.  No, it just really doesn't say that, Bob.  Oh, sorry.  It says, I loathe Opie.  You missed the.  Right.  You're confused.  Yeah.  I'd love to smash Opie in the face. 
[04:08:30]  All right.  Well.  End the show.  Could you end the show, sir?  Who are you?  I'm Ron Stablehorn.  Oh.  Vice President of Marketing for Rolling Rock Beer, and I've been.  Oh, nice.  Oh, shit.  You didn't say that.  All right.  Oh, shit.  What happened there, Opie?  That's what we weren't supposed to say.  Oh, shit.  What?  Wow.  You know that communique that had Steve sweating? 
[04:09:00]  Yeah.  That was the word that I stopped at.  Oh, no.  Oh, shit.  Vice President?  We'll make it.  All right.  Look at, man.  Look at this.  Well, let's see if we could, you know, smooth it over off the air.  Let's go.  Well, Will's on a stool outside the studio now.  He's tying his tie to a pipe. 
[04:09:30]  They probably have another shoot to do after this, though, right?  Yeah.  We're all behind schedule now.  No?  Is that the camera you're using?  Wait.  Are we filming this?  No.  No, I'm serious.  Oh, it's just audio?  Oh, man.  I put on a nice shirt today for this.  I knew.  You knew?  You knew it was going to be video?  No, I knew it was going to be audio.  Oh, that's why you dress like a soldier?  Shit.  Like a soldier in the Nazi army for some reason.  You really? 
[04:10:00]  I'm wearing a...  You're wearing a fucking...  No, it's not.  It's a hat from a video game, and it's not a swastika.  It's got like a curl thing in it that it does make certain people uncomfortable.  I understand, but I'm sorry.  It's just kind of...  The closest to a swastika that you could actually wear.  Without getting kicked out of person.  First of all, it's on a wing something.  It's on eagle wings.  Which is pretty much German when you have that little symbol.  You could put like a Star of David on eagle wings, and it still looks German.  Yeah, I understand. 
[04:10:30]  Just one call.  No!  I'm stalling.  I need to feel better about myself.  Look, I'll give it to you.  I mean, I just decided that I like doing radio again a mere three or four days ago.  So before that, I will agree with you.  But the last three or four days, come on.  I've listened to the show this week.  Radio gold.  Very funny this week.  All everybody.  Because I decided to do radio again, bossy.  It's a very great show.  And a couple weeks ago, what a great show.  You had all those huge guests.  Yes.  How about you throw me a bone?  One. 
[04:11:00]  Oh, well.  I can call if you want me to go in.  No, that guy over there.  I don't even know your name, and I've been working with you for three years.  What's your name?  Brian.  Oh, hi, Brian.  He's picking up his cell phone.  He's going to call in just so we end this and say how good I actually am.  Oh, my dear Lord.  Oh, my dear sweet Jesus Christ on a cross.  I just need one, and we can end the show.  That's all I need.  Just one.  This is so uncomfortable.  To counteract the hate that is out there for me. 
[04:11:30]  Hey, Anthony, stop.  Stop.  Stop looking at how tall.  I could do the show like this, or I could do the show looking at Bobby Kelly.  Well, you know what?  I didn't see who was on the screen.  Because you don't show me.  I'm just playing.  Because you're on the screen and you're cock-walking video.  He hides.  And it's just fucking, you know.  Well, just let us enjoy it.  It doesn't matter.  If I'm looking at it, I could look up here and look at fucking Pakistan.  And on CNN, I could look at this one and look at this red-headed broad.  Anthony is smooth as far as clicking off websites, clicking off. 
[04:12:00]  He can multitask like anybody.  Oh, we're not noticing anything.  He's actually typing on his phone.  Oh, you were really looking at the drudge report for the radio show.  All of a sudden, that pops on the screen as we walk by.  You never saw the park's tail.  Isn't there a morning period that I'm allowed?  Isn't there a period of time I'm allowed to see?  I'd be able to.  I'd never seen a quicker click finger.  Oh, there's Fark.  Yeah, we need Fark for the show right now, don't we, Anthony?  In life, there's nothing worse than wasted talent. 
[04:12:30]  All right, see?  Cock sucker, use your talent.  Oh, God.  All of a sudden, it's CNN.com.  Yeah, all right.  You want to just get the latest news, don't you, for the 720 break?  Bobby, goddammit, you're my best friend now.  Yeah, throw some papers in front of him, see what he can come up with.  I'm going to sleep like a baby tonight.  You're getting fragged on Call of Duty 4, you motherfucker.  You're going to give up my screen name again?  You say, you fucking son of a bitch, clogged up my fucking system for a year. 
[04:13:00]  Bobby, me and you, bro.  Hot shaves, side by side.  Me and Bobby.  Maybe get some sushi.  That's right.  Talk about relationships.  I've been trying to figure out how to break this on the show here.  Yeah.  You did it for us.  Thank you.  And you also broke the fact that he's fanboy with some of these interviews.  Oh, it's just, I was at the airport.  It's rat out Bobby.  I call him Bobby the rat.  Bobby the rat?  Bobby the rat?  Oh, you mean Bobby the rat? 
[04:13:30]  He's fucking two-  Rats me out for everything?  Dude, let me tell you something.  I listened Friday when you had lock-in.  Yeah.  Oh, no, Wednesday?  Yeah.  Was it Wednesday?  I was-  Oh, my God.  I was at the airport, like, hitting the table.  Like, shut the fuck up.  I want to hear.  Oh, you just-  Sorry, I'm a fan.  Ant, by the way.  Oh, jeez.  These guys, he's got a loosely folder open.  Well, let me tell you what-  Things highlighted.  Let me tell you what we do now.  It's my plans to take over the world.  Yeah, I hope it works out for you.  Yeah.  Let me tell you what we do now, Ant.  Ant, focus.  Yes.  Sorry. 
[04:14:00]  We've done 22 minutes of bonus time show.  Wow.  We take that off the show tomorrow.  So now we're at 10.38-ish.  Yeah.  So maybe we should do this to you tomorrow.  Now we got at least 10 to 15 minutes with these guys.  Now we're talking 10.23.  Uh-huh.  We get to go home tomorrow.  Mm-hmm.  I like it.  And then you get to go to Cleveland a little earlier so you can see Jimmy.  Yes.  I'm seeing Jimmy.  As the quotes go up in the air.  All over the fucking place.  What are you talking about?  No, Anthony.  I can't just go in.  See Jimmy.  Jimmy, Jimmy.  Hey, Jimmy. 
[04:14:30]  How you doing?  Is Jimmy not in Cleveland doing a comedy show?  Yes.  Yeah.  And that's where I'm going.  Do you know what hotel he's staying at?  Yes, I do.  Are you staying at the same hotel?  I'm not saying that.  Are you staying at the same hotel?  I'm not giving out hotel information.  I'm not saying.  I asked you.  Why would I give out hotel information?  I asked you, are you staying at the same hotel as him?  I'm not giving you that information.  That doesn't mean.  That's not any information.  Yes, it is.  There are fans that if they get a hold of Jimmy's information or mine, then they got both of ours.  Yeah, they really.  What do you mean?  Why am I going to do that?  You think they're going to knock on every door and run down? 
[04:15:00]  You're a fucking middle-aged guy with a fucking gokey.  All right.  Keep bringing it up.  Fucking 18.  Just got out of high school.  How old do you think you are, motherfucker?  Jesus Christ.  Oh, shit.  I know when to put medicine in my beard.  Yeah.  Tell me about it because I can see your gray roots in your fucking beard.  Well, at least I put medicine.  I'm not putting medicine in my beard.  I love how you call it medicine.  I did it once for Letterman, and it gave me a rash.  You really?  You gave me a rash. 
[04:15:30]  Did it really?  Yeah.  You put fucking medicine in for Letterman?  Well, I just, like a little thing, because I was going on fucking Letterman, and those  things, the cameras pick it up, and it looks like it got fucking sparkles on your face.  HD, you look like a hunk of shit.  You gotta, like, you know, do some things.  Anthony looked terrific on that.  Thank you, sir.  Don't fuck with him.  What am I talking about?  Thank you.  What are you talking about?  About goddamn time.  Don't fuck with him.  Oh, I get it.  You're trying to set me up to bond through.  I'm with you.  I want this done with, too.  Believe me, I am all with you, sir.  We got an Irish brother thing happening here. 
[04:16:00]  Don't fuck with him.  Yeah.  He's not Irish.  No, but it's like Irish brothers.  Right.  We could give each other shit all we want, but then the second somebody else gives one  of us shit, we pile on.  Boom, boom.  You got a little too real right there.  Yeah.  With what?  You did.  Are you out of your mind?  Yeah, I am.  Yes.  You're fucking nuts.  Relax.  You've got a little too personal.  Real how?  Yeah, you gotta know where to stop.  Yeah, you gotta know where to stop.  You want to get another CD player in here?  Fucking cracker.  Look, I'm listening. 
[04:16:30]  All I gotta do is, I just gotta text in, yes.  What is that about?  Another clue to the puzzle?  No, I just had to do that.  I gotta write that down.  Yes what?  There we go.  All right, let's end this.  Let's go.  One football.  Let's end this.  One.  Just one.  I just need one, please.  I need to do this.  Hold on.  Stupid meeting.  Hold on.  There we go.  Sorry, no offense, guys.  I don't really mean it's a stupid meeting.  It's just, you know, it's a chance. 
[04:17:00]  No, you're anti-Semitic.  You're just kind of.  No, I know.  I know, because of the stupid hat.  You know, I live amongst Jewish people.  My whole neighborhood is Jewish, and I love the Jewish people, because they keep the best  property, the values of the property, impeccable.  We do.  I know you do.  Yes.  Believe me, I knew you were Jewish, sir.  I wasn't trying to glaze over that one.  I'm glad this interview wasn't with BET.  I'm the only...  You'd be singing a different tune.  I actually had a menorah up in my window for Christmas. 
[04:17:30]  Like me, I have my Christmas decoration, but menorah up in the window, just because,  you know, I get along with the neighbors very nicely.  Christmica.  Yeah.  Christmica.  Yeah.  Christmica.  No, more...  I should put more Hanukkah in there.  It shouldn't just be Christmas-ah.  That's all right.  It should be like Han-a-mis.  Miss.  Han-a-mis.  Yeah.  Why are you throwing Jesus under the bus to be friends with this guy?  Just stick to your guns, you Italian asshole.  What the fuck?  You're going to know this guy for eight minutes.  He's never going to talk to you again. 
[04:18:00]  You're throwing Jesus under the fucking...  I don't know who he is yet.  If I find out he's not that high up on the totem pole, then I'll give him some shit.  You drink wine.  It's fucking beer.  You drink it.  I love...  Meshavitz.  Yes.  See?  Yes.  That's good stuff.  I like sitting.  Sometimes I just eat bitter herbs for no reason.  And unleavened bread.  I love this stuff.  You go to B&H just for shits and giggles?  I do.  I shop at B&H for all my video needs. 
[04:18:30]  And I really do.  B&H is an amazing place.  They're not even a sponsor.  That place is amazing.  Best place ever.  I think a Hasidic Jew should run everything.  Yes.  Oh, it's so sufficient.  Except the clothing stores.  Lack of selection.  I just winked at Bobby.  Okay, come on.  Come on.  Because I don't want him really mad.  We got to get out of here.  It was just fun for the radio to make believe I was mad.  Oh, my God.  This is ridiculous.  Everybody's making the wrap-it-up things.  All right, let's get a phone call.  You got to put your fucking tornado hands. 
[04:19:00]  Let's do a phone call.  Somebody who loves...  Bronx Johnny, he's calling from out there.  He's outside the window.  What the fuck?  This is who I get?  Oh, my God.  Bronx Johnny.  Hey, what's up?  What's up, bro?  How you doing, man?  Ron and Fez told us today.  I called to say, I love you.  I thought I could see you calling me.  This isn't good.  Oh, shit.  I'm trying, man.  You sound sad.  Fuck, man.  I know you want us out of the studio so you guys can set up, but fuck, I just want one  lousy listener to call for real.  Oh.  All right.  Thanks, Bronx Johnny. 
[04:19:30]  As I wave to him as he hangs up the phone.  That's always good.  All right.  We'll leave without my one compliment.  All right.  He was right out the glass there?  Yeah.  He's right there.  Ron and Fez go on when?  In 20 minutes.  Yeah.  Two minutes.  Yeah, in two minutes.  All right.  We got to go.  All right.  The O.B. and Anthony Show wants you to take...  Hey!  Good.  Now I'm not playing.  The O.B. and Anthony Show wants you to take some of their bestest bits ever, or maybe 
[04:20:00]  just a bit you think is funny, and animate it.  Draw a cartoon around it.  There's big cash money waiting for you if you do the bestest one, and the really, really  good ones are going to get showcased at a big event we're doing in May to be announced.  For samples of wonderful animations and for bit ideas, go to opiananthony.com.  Take your time with your masterpiece.  We're looking for clever, not necessarily filthy, because let's be honest, while some  of you are very talented, you're also fucking psychotic, so tone it down if you can.  If you can't, well, at least we ask. 
[04:20:30]  And when you're finished with your animation, mail it in to the O.B. and Anthony Show Animation  Contest, XM Satellite Radio, 111 West 57th Street, Suite 500, New York, New York, 10019.  Don't spread it all over the internet before we have a chance to judge it.  Thank you.  Greetings, people.
