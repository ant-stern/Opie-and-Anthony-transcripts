<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts’ characteristically vulgar and self-aggrandizing introductions, quickly transitioning to complaints about unexpectedly bad Memorial Day weekend weather.  A large Tiffany box, an anonymous gift for Anthony, became a major topic.  Speculation about the sender ran wild until it was revealed to be comedian Kevin Pollack, rectifying an earlier mistaken attribution of a different gift from Paul Anka.  Pollack called in, explaining his gift was a response to the misidentification.  The hosts detailed the contents and cost of both gifts, engaging in humorous commentary on the packaging and Pollack's apparent annoyance.

The conversation then shifted to Amanda Bynes’ erratic behavior and recent arrest.  Dr. Steve called in, detailing his family's unusual Memorial Day plans involving tree climbing, shooting guns, and fly fishing.  Further discussion of the gifts and potential celebrity senders followed.  The segment concluded with more banter and a final chat with Kevin Pollack, who discussed his podcast, his film at the Cannes Film Festival, anecdotes involving Jerry Lewis, and experiences with a luxurious lifestyle.

A significant portion of the show focused on the Jodi Arias mistrial.  The hosts and co-hosts dissected the trial, using highly offensive and sexually explicit language to describe Arias and her actions.  They analyzed audio clips of Arias's statements and speculated about the reasons for the jury's inability to reach a unanimous verdict on the death penalty, frequently referencing Arias's perceived attractiveness.  Nude photographs of Jodi Arias were also shown and discussed.  The segment also featured repeated calls from "Bobo," a listener obsessively trying to join the show's upcoming bus trip, whose desperate behavior was mocked by the hosts. They played a recorded message satirizing a previous show segment with a different host.  Alongside the Arias discussion, there were side conversations about Kevin Pollack's search for a specific crumb cake, and upcoming guests Annie Lederman, Jeffrey Tambor, and Mick Foley were briefly mentioned.

Comedian Annie Lederman was then in-studio.  The segment began with a humorous discussion of a phone call with someone nicknamed "E-Rog," focusing on his attempts to evade responsibility.  The hosts made sexually suggestive comments about Lederman’s appearance.  A substantial portion of the conversation revolved around body hair, with Lederman discussing her hair removal methods, leading to a discussion of various body hair preferences, including female genitalia, referencing specific porn stars like Bianca Stone.  The conversation touched on cosmetic procedures, with images shown of Mistress Rhiannon, known for extreme breast augmentations.  Personal anecdotes concluded the segment, including Jim Norton’s humiliation at being denied entry to a strip club, and Lederman's stories of working as a go-go dancer with crabs and a difficult past relationship.  Archived Opie and Anthony show images were shown throughout.

Annie Lederman remained in studio, with Mick Foley and Jeffrey Tambor scheduled to appear later. Lederman graphically detailed a pubic lice infestation and explicit sexual encounters with men possessing micropenises.  Mick Foley's arrival was met with jokes about his physical condition.  He discussed his stand-up show, health issues, his unusual Christmas room, and family life.  A photograph of Foley dressed as Santa Claus led to a discussion of his Santa Claus persona and related projects, including a documentary. Foley's sexual preferences were also discussed, including his admission to masturbating to Helen Mirren, leading to a discussion about aging and female attractiveness.  Lederman shared another anecdote about a man with a micropenis involving a police officer, and Opie recounted a story about losing sensation in his genitals while driving.  The segment ended with comedic exchanges between Lederman and Foley, anticipating Tambor’s arrival.

Actor Jeffrey Tambor and Mick Foley joined the show. Foley discussed his roles in *The Ropers* and *And Justice for All*, sharing anecdotes from the sets and mentioning the film's composer whose work he disliked; he also recounted a darkly humorous anecdote involving a phone call from his deceased uncle.  His wrestling career and injuries were discussed, including a humorous story about losing his ear in Germany. Nick Foley, a huge *Arrested Development* fan, was present, prompting Tambor to discuss his experiences on the show and the challenges of reuniting the cast.  Foley gifted Tambor a Santa Claus t-shirt. A call from DJ Who Kid discussed his recent arrest and a song he made with Tupac featuring Fandango. Foley’s weight loss, family, and upcoming Hall of Fame induction (involving Santa Claus) were also discussed, along with his experiences with hate mail and volunteer work for RAINN.  Sam Roberts, host of the post-Opie and Anthony show, discussed his friendship with Foley. The segment concluded with plugs for Foley's appearances and a Santa Claus documentary Kickstarter.

A final segment featured Mick Foley.  He discussed his wrestling career, including a humorous anecdote about a graphic changing from a Hannibal Lecter mask to a Santa hat.  He showed the hosts a shirt, leading to a comedic exchange about its size. He talked about upcoming wrestling interviews and shows, including appearances at Caroline's. He shared a story about a chance encounter with a Rockette at a Knicks game, which involved a misunderstanding with his wife about Santa Claus.  He discussed interactions with women, including female wrestlers, porn stars, and a blind massage therapist, detailing a fantasy involving a porn star's daughter and his attempts to prove his innocent intentions to his wife. He also discussed his Hall of Fame induction, including the reactions to Maria Menounos' and Bob Backlund's speeches.  The segment concluded with a Dollar Shave Club commercial read by the hosts using highly profane language.

[00:05:30]  Booga, booga.  Enough of this plava.  Let's get this show on the road.  Tyson rules.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ah, morning.  Hi.  Look at that.  Friday, huh?  We're broadcasting.  Yes, we are.  Ah.  Ah, fucking rain, huh?  Ah, it's going to fuck the entire Memorial Day weekend up. 
[00:06:00]  Well, at least it's not Rochester.  What's going on there?  I was there earlier this week for a little funeral action.  And when I was up there, it was 81 degrees.  It was, it was brutal.  It was, it felt like the middle of summer.  Really?  Today, it's raining.  It's 39 degrees.  They think it actually might snow in the area today.  Snow.  That's going to give people the cold.  Holy fuck.  How does it go from 81 to 39?  I don't know.  They keep saying the, uh, the summer, uh, that summer weather system. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Can't get rocking.  We keep falling into these, um.  No, we just moved, uh, we just moved ahead a month or something.  Does that happen?  Yeah, it used to be April showers, and for the last bunch of years, it's now May showers.  Well, what happens to, like, October then?  Then that's why we squeezed the whole spring thing, and we kind of go right from winter  to summer now.  It's been like that for a few years.  I would like to see some summer, though.  Well, yeah.  I mean, this weekend's the kickoff, so.  I know.  It's not like it's a few weeks in. 
[00:07:00]  You still got time.  You know what, though?  I got people coming over.  You know, family's coming by.  Yeah.  It's kind of a tradition, you know, Memorial Day weekend, get the pool going, and, you  know, fucking 45 degrees tonight, apparently.  Really?  Yeah.  Ouch.  45 degrees tonight.  Sorry to smile.  That keeps people indoors.  Oh, oh, oh, I see, Jimmy.  That'll help Jimmy's numbers.  I was telling you, comics, there's no one happier than comedians and people with indoor  events right now.  Please, fucking rain.  Shut-ins.  Hoarders. 
[00:07:30]  Helps Jimmy's numbers.  Yeah, it does.  Stress factory.  The shitty weather always helps gigs, and you hate to boost your shit weather, but it  helps.  Well, I have to present a box.  Oh.  Oh, what's her name?  Nah.  A box?  Yeah.  I think this has something to do with the Paul Anka fucking thing.  What?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh.  There's a few buttons.  I got a box. 
[00:08:00]  A box?  Another gift.  Another gift?  Another gift.  All right.  It's a...  I didn't actually...  I only opened up, like, the card, and then I said I gotta save it for the radio.  That's a pretty large box.  Remember the Paul Anka thing?  Of course.  Paul Anka, because he was on our show, he sent me a decanter, a crystal decanter  and crystal glasses.  Yes.  And the note just says, can't believe Sam thought it was me.  Enjoy your gift. 
[00:08:30]  Believe Sam thought it was me.  You want to guess?  Enjoy your gift.  Oh, wait.  You really weren't...  You weren't here that day, so you're not going to be able to guess.  I...  No, I wasn't here that day.  Wait.  Were you here for the opening of the Paul Anka gift, though?  That I wasn't here for.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, then you should be able to guess.  Wow, it's a big square box.  It's about...  It's a huge Tiffany box.  That's a big Tiffany box.  So it's going to be more nonsense.  It's, uh...  I got a lot of wedding gifts, man. 
[00:09:00]  Because I'm re-fucking-wrapping all this shit.  What is that, about 14 inches cubed?  It could...  Maybe 12, 14.  It's a box that could fit E-Rock's head easily.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Right?  That is a big box.  Do you want to guess?  Tiff, a blue Tiffany box.  Well, the note gives it away.  Can't believe Sam thought it was me.  Enjoy your gift.  That's from the day I opened up the Paul Anka thing.  You weren't here when you opened up the Paul Anka thing, because that's when we also called Barry Williams. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, shit.  Oh, yeah.  I was in the car.  You were in route, so, okay, that's fair enough.  All right.  I know who I thought it was.  I got a gift that day, and Sam guessed who it had to be from, because I said it was from a celebrity.  Didn't I say that much?  A celebrity.  Right.  Colin Quinn?  No.  Colin Quinn wouldn't shop at Tiffany's.  What's wrong with you?  Of course not.  What the hell?  Worst guest ever. 
[00:10:00]  Um, a celebrity.  Yeah, it's another celebrity gift.  Obviously, it's done the show.  All based on the fact that Sam thought it was him the first time, so he decided, I better send a gift now.  He's obviously done the show.  Oh, this isn't from Paul Anka?  No.  Oh.  No.  It'd be so weird if it was another Paul Anka gift.  Yeah, the Paul Anka gift leads to this, because we thought the Paul Anka gift was from the other guy,  so the other guy said, you know what, fuck you.  So, you know, I can't believe Sam thought it was me. 
[00:10:30]  Anyway, enjoy your gift.  Oh, Dr. Steve.  No.  Celebrity.  Well, that's what I'm saying, but a celebrity would have to be listening to the show to know that.  Celebrity that listens to the show.  Dr. Steve gave me a very nice birthday wish.  Justin Stengel?  And a, I think it's a $100 Amazon card.  Very nice.  Thank you, Dr. Steve.  He's a nice man.  Anthony Bourdain?  No.  Uh, should I just give it a, it's not that big of a deal, but.  Kevin Pollack?  Yes.  Oh, it is Kevin Pollack.  It's Kevin Pollack.  Oh, shit. 
[00:11:00]  Yes, because the day when we were trying to figure out who sent me that, uh, that gift,  Sam goes, what'd you say exactly?  I said, it's gotta be Kevin Pollack.  He's the only celebrity who listens to the show.  Right.  On a regular basis.  Uh-huh.  And it turned out to be Paul Anka.  So, the card reads, can't believe Sam thought it was me.  Enjoy your gift.  He's in Cannes, I think.  Huh?  I think he's at the Cannes movie festival there.  Oh.  Is that close?  No.  Oh.  France.  So, he fucking gave me a huge gift. 
[00:11:30]  A lot of bubble wrap.  A huge gift from Tiffany's.  Don't break it.  A lot of bubble wrap.  He loves saying slobo, too.  He does.  He loves the whole slobo thing.  I'm getting wedding gifts.  Oh.  Congratulations.  What is it?  Oh, wow.  Well, it's stuff I'm gonna carefully unwrap, because I'm fucking re-gifting this shit.  Oh, my God.  It's Kevin Pollack.  Yeah, don't announce that.  He's listening.  Yeah.  He's in some very good movies.  Well, look.  They're really nice Tiffany glasses. 
[00:12:00]  That's like blue Tiffany blue glasses.  What the?  Nice.  Tiffany blue glasses.  Jesus.  Wow.  That's four of them.  And then what's this?  I don't know.  Pitcher?  A water jug for lemonade.  Is that a decanter?  More glasses?  Wow.  It's six really nice blue, what is it called?  Blue glass glasses or something?  Oh.  Whoa.  And then a fish bowl or something.  That one's for me. 
[00:12:30]  That is.  It's a big, it's a pitcher.  It's a pitcher.  And it looks exactly like the old school Kool-Aid pitcher.  And all because we thought he sent the original gift.  So, thank you.  Wow.  Paul Anka.  What the fuck am I going to do with this shit?  Kevin Pollack.  It's all nice, but what am I going to do with this?  You display it.  You throw out old glasses.  I don't have anywhere to fucking display this shit.  Throw out old glasses and use those.  They're nice.  In your kitchen? 
[00:13:00]  Your Kevin Pollack glasses.  Huh?  That's like an impressive thing.  Yeah, you see, when you serve somebody, you say to yourself, you go, oh, you say to people,  and by the way, you're drinking out of glasses that were given to me by Kevin Pollack.  Right.  I got wedding gifts for four and a half years that are still in the boxes, just tucked away.  How much did he spend?  Oh, I'm trying to find that out.  Oh, my God.  This is not the...  You got to know.  No.  No.  You just appreciate the gift.  Should we guess it's six glasses?  Right.  I want to know if he spent more money than Paul Anka. 
[00:13:30]  That would be pretty impressive.  How much did Paul Anka spend?  You know, at this point, people should just send the fucking receipt with it.  Oh, jeez.  How much did Paul Anka spend?  I don't know.  It was a couple hundred bucks, easily.  Either $250 or like $600, depending.  Those are from Tiffany.  Really from Tiffany.  They are from Tiffany.  Look at his fucking Tiffany box.  That doesn't matter.  He could just be smart and put fucking average stuff in a Tiffany box.  It's wrapped in Tiffany bubble wrap.  Tiffany bubble wrap with Tiffany little tape on it. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, but he knows somebody who works there.  Oh, boy.  And then here's the receipt from Tiffany.  Oh, wow.  Of course, they left the price out, so we're going to have to look it up ourselves.  Yeah.  What a pain in the ass.  No shit.  Make it easy.  Refresh.  It's called officially...  Oh.  I got the item number and everything.  Oh, right.  Can you put the item number in?  Yeah, you can get it.  Refresh set picture with six glasses.  Refresh?  Made in Slovenia.  That's got to be impressive.  What's the item number?  You got a place for item number? 
[00:14:30]  There it is.  Okay.  There it is.  Holy shit.  What?  It's $240 for the set.  Wow.  For the whole thing?  He spent $240 plus shipping.  Nice.  I think that's more than Paul Anka.  Maybe it was in the Cannes Film Festival gift bag.  Oh, you think?  It's a rewrap from him?  Sent it over.  Hmm.  Can that happen?  That might be in a gift bag.  No, no, no. 
[00:15:00]  Kevin could afford $240.  No, Kevin Pollack.  Of course he can.  Kevin Pollack wouldn't dare do that, would he?  That's very nice of him.  I got two celebrity gifts now.  That's pretty good.  But Kevin Pollack didn't sign the card like Paul Anka did.  He probably ordered it online.  Sure.  All right.  So now, Kevin, you're going to have to send an autograph or something.  Wow.  That's very nice.  Thank you.  I don't know what the fuck I'm going to do with this.  Iced tea you could put in there.  Yeah.  On such a hot day.  Hey, this is great iced tea.  I got to put it all back together. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, my God.  Kenny.  That's shit.  Let Kenny do it.  You could throw a party now.  Yeah.  And have like alcohol out of the Paul Anka glassware.  Right.  And then the soft drink.  Right.  The lemonade or iced tea.  Just throwing it back in the box.  No, no.  No.  Oh.  Thank God for bubble wrap.  Bubble wrap.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, my goodness.  How am I going to do with this? 
[00:16:00]  Entertain.  You don't have...  I like gifts I could use.  But you can use that.  How?  Who fucking makes lemonade?  It's...  Ken, would you use this shit?  Shit.  He listens.  Yeah.  Holy Christ.  That'd be nice.  You make some lemonade and then you have all of your friends come over and you still have  four glasses left over.  Well, thank you to Kevin Pollack.  It's terrific.  Well, now you just need something for milk, milk, around the back fudge is made. 
[00:16:30]  Right.  You have for the lemonade.  We got the lemonade.  Now I just need the fudge maker.  And then the milk.  Oh, boy.  This is great.  That is a good gift there.  That's very nice.  Yeah.  The decanter from Paul Anka cost a hundred bucks.  A hundred bucks?  I would have thought more.  No.  It was crystal.  We looked it up.  Oh, shit.  It was a hundred bucks.  Now what?  Really?  There's a fucking...  I don't have to save that. 
[00:17:00]  Vice war.  I'm just going to save the fucking note.  I think probably...  Paul Anka probably spent altogether just under two hundred.  Mm-hmm.  But Kevin Pollack is $2.40 before shipping and tax.  Hmm.  Can we stop it right here?  No more wedding gifts.  That's wrong.  These are like wedding gifts.  Yeah?  Yes.  I don't know.  What if...  These are old school wedding gifts.  You know, nowadays we all just throw fucking money around.  A little cash in an envelope.  I don't know.  This is old school wedding gifts I'm starting to get from people.  Do you think that this... 
[00:17:30]  I have no room in my house for this.  A lot of thought went into this.  I appreciate that.  He sat there and was like, what can I get?  Ah, a refresher set.  Yeah, but he's annoyed.  Look at his note.  Can't believe Sam thought it was me.  Enjoy your gift.  Like, he felt like he had to send something.  Well, I feel like...  Well, we realized it wasn't from him.  What if maybe it's time for Stifler to send a gift now?  Stifler?  Yeah, he listens sometimes.  Stifler.  Wait, who are our regular celebrity listeners?  Let's strong-arm them and have them send fucking wedding gifts, too. 
[00:18:00]  More gifts.  Let's call them wedding gifts.  They're wedding gifts.  When Stifler came in here, he had legitimate favorite O&A bits.  Right.  Stifler listens.  And Tom Hanks' son, Colin Hanks.  Colin Hanks listens.  He's a regular.  What's his name?  Dana?  Dana's a listener.  Dana White, when he listens.  Dana White's a listener.  Oh, he's got tons of cash.  Yeah, he's got a lot of money.  Got a lot of money.  A lot of money.  A lot of money.  Dana.  A lot of money.  Does McFoley listen on a regular basis?  He's coming in today.  He is, but he's not the most tech-savvy guy. 
[00:18:30]  Or generous.  He's not generous.  He's cheap.  I know, but maybe he can stop at a mall on the way.  Just pick up a little something.  Yeah, get me a platter or something.  Something from a kiosk.  Right, some dumb platter would be nice.  Stop by one of these gift shop t-shirt stores on the way here.  Some kind of cheese platter display thing.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah, this is a great thing we're starting.  Kenny, get rid of that fucking thing.  Thanks.  Oh, my God.  It's too big. 
[00:19:00]  Where am I going to put it?  Is it your dining room?  Do you have anything right here?  Dining room?  What the fuck's wrong with you?  I thought maybe that you had a sideboard in your dining room.  I'm lucky I could push toys away and find a place to lay down and sleep at night.  A dining room.  Oh, my God.  That is a lot of glass to have, like, out when you have kids around, too.  Right.  Yeah.  When you're having people over, how great would this be?  Should we get some fresh lemonade and do it up nice today? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Or some iced tea, like Duck Dynasty.  You should have, like, a silver tray that you bring it out on with the iced tea and go, everybody, some iced tea.  Well, I'm going to set up a registry for all our celebrity friends.  So, I'll put that on there.  It's an O&A show registry.  Registry.  Because, for some reason, I'm getting wedding gifts four and a half years later.  That's great, though.  He put thought into this.  Yeah, but I keep going back to the note.  He was strong-armed and was forced to send a gift. 
[00:20:00]  You honestly think that he heard, like, Sam say that and was like, oh, this fucking guy.  Now I've got to get it.  Yeah, because we were talking about how he listens all the time.  And Sam guessed it was him.  And then it turned out to be Paul Anker with a handwritten note all nice and stuff.  So, here's his note.  Can't believe Sam thought it was me.  Enjoy your gift.  He didn't even sign it.  Oh.  Wait, how do we know it's from him?  Oh, man.  Well, that's who I thought it was.  Oh, my God.  I just assumed.  There's no name on it at all?  No.  That's how annoyed he is. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, my God.  Whoa.  So, wait a minute.  That's how annoyed he is.  Oh, you're just guessing.  You didn't imply that it was somebody else.  But Sam only mentioned that one person.  But nowhere on the gift does it say Kevin Pollack.  Oh, I just think it's Kevin Pollack.  Yeah.  What if it is Dr. Steve?  No, it's not Dr. Steve.  Could be Dr. Steve.  Yeah.  Really?  He's weird.  But, Sam, you said.  I did say Kevin Pollack.  You might have said Dr. Steve in that moment, too. 
[00:21:00]  But I probably also said Dr. Steve.  How did you say it?  Did you go, oh, I bet it's from Kevin Pollack?  Or you went, oh, here's a gift from Kevin Pollack.  Opie said, who do you think it's from?  And he was giving hints.  He said, it's a celebrity.  And I said, I know.  Kevin Pollack.  And Opie goes, why would Kevin Pollack be sending something?  And I said, he's the only celebrity that listens to the show.  It's probably Kevin Pollack, then.  Return Department, Parsippany, New Jersey.  What?  That doesn't matter if you order it online. 
[00:21:30]  And then it says Astoria Boulevard, Third Floor, East Elmhurst.  Yeah, it's all online.  Yeah, that's just in the warehouse.  But it doesn't say that it's from Kevin Pollack, now that I think about it.  No fucking hint whatsoever.  Maybe it's Penn Jillette.  Penn Jillette.  He listens to the show, right?  I don't know if he does.  I think his whole crew does.  He's very busy.  He is busy.  Busy getting fucked out of Celebrity Apprentice.  Exactly.  Dr. Steve. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  We love waking up Dr. Steve.  He sounds so sleepy.  Yeah.  I'm on vacation, you asshole.  I didn't call you.  I didn't call you.  I didn't even say to call you.  Where are you?  I'm at Mountains of Dan, Virginia.  I thought you said you were on vacation.  Yeah, really.  What's there to do there?  All kinds of stuff.  Yeah, you know, the kids got out of school, so we're taking them on a trip.  And they're going to get to go ATVing and shooting guns. 
[00:22:30]  That's a rugged vacation.  What?  Nice.  We called this place and they said, oh, yeah, no, your kids are too young to ride horses,  but they can shoot guns.  I don't know.  They're too young to ride horses, but they're not too young to shoot guns.  That's right.  Man, you live in a great part of the country.  America.  You live in America, right?  Exactly.  Did you send me something from Tiffany's? 
[00:23:00]  No, I did not.  Oh.  Yeah.  I knew this was a...  Do you hear how appalled Steve was at that?  No, I did not.  I know.  I knew this was a long shot.  I don't even know why we had to wake you up to ask you.  No, that's okay.  I sent you an Amazon gift card.  Yeah, I said that.  $100, right?  Nice.  I looked it up.  And I know it's like your position on that.  You're giving somebody money and telling them where to spend it, but...  It's the thought, Steve.  That's very thoughtful. 
[00:23:30]  I like all the thoughts that come in.  I appreciate it.  All right.  No, we got some weird Tiffany fucking gift.  Thank you.  We got some weird Tiffany gift today.  We're trying to figure out who sent it.  We think it's Kevin Pollack.  E-Rock just told me in my ear that I also said it could be Guy Fieri.  Or it could be Paul Angus.  Oh, there's no fucking flames on these things.  There's nothing that says rock and roll on this gift, so I would say it's not Guy Fieri.  Oh, Guy Fieri wouldn't go to Tiffany's?  Of course not.  No.  He just sent you some of his own shit. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, exactly.  A picture of him with his glasses on, signed.  He would send...  His knives.  He would send me those knives where you don't even know how to hold it because they're all  designed weird, so you don't even know how to hold a fucking thing.  The ergonomic handle?  I don't know.  It's like, where do I hold it?  Blade?  I have no idea how to hold a Guy Fieri knife.  It's got flames on it.  Right.  It's just weird angles to it and stuff.  I think it's like brass knuckles, but it's a knife.  I don't know.  I guess we'd have to go with Kevin Pollack, but like I said, he's so annoyed he didn't even 
[00:24:30]  sign it.  Well, it's online.  He was forced to send this.  You'd think they would have at least put his name on there.  Right.  It's like, here, put this on the card, and then you put, you know, Kevin Pollack.  Unless he didn't want to.  Maybe he just wanted to say, can't believe Sam thought it was me.  True.  Assume that we would know it was him.  Yeah.  Be a little funny about it.  But were you, like, guessing?  Like, oh, it's Kevin Pollack.  Oh, it's Guy Fieri.  No, I asserted it was Kevin Pollack.  Oh, okay. 
[00:25:00]  All right.  Then I got to assume it's Kevin Pollack.  Why'd you think it was him?  Yeah.  Because he listens to the show a lot.  Yeah.  You know, he's a jokester, so it's more like, you know, decanter, fucking, you know, iced  tea pitcher, six glasses instead of four glasses.  Yeah.  That's pretty good.  Now I got ten fucking glasses.  But Kevin Pollack's gift was better than Paul Anka's gift.  Why?  The Paul Anka gift looked way classier.  Yeah.  It was crystal. 
[00:25:30]  Kevin Pollack's is from Tiffany, which is nice.  Yeah.  Six glasses.  Right.  And a nice pitcher.  There's a lot more opportunity to use this.  You're not a heavy drinker.  Right.  That's true.  That's true.  Kevin Pollack did give you a much better gift than Paul Anka.  Kevin Pollack knows you better than Paul Anka.  Paul Anka, handwritten note.  Proof of that gift.  That I could display.  Oh, that's old school.  I got a nice one of those with my cologne, too.  Did you really?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, I shipped it to my house.  Very nice.  Very nice.  Definitely an attempt at one-upsmanship, it sounds like. 
[00:26:00]  One-upsmanship.  It sounds like.  One-upsmanship.  I love Dr. Steve.  I like a groggy Dr. Steve.  Yeah.  Oh.  He's just trying to hang in there.  They arrested that bitch, huh?  Oh, my God.  What'd she do this time?  This bitch is crazy.  What is it?  Amanda fucking, how do you say her last name?  Bynes.  Amanda Bynes.  Amanda Bynes.  She went from extremely hot to she's just a complete and utter lunatic.  She was like girl-next-door-looking Nickelodeon star. 
[00:26:30]  Right.  She threw a bong out her window?  She threw a bong out her window.  I guess the building she's in, she was in the lobby smoking a little weed, and the guy  in the lobby called the cops.  I don't know why you'd do that.  Right.  You're an asshole.  And I guess they went up to her apartment, whatever.  The guy that called the cops obviously doesn't like girls.  That's how that works.  He's a homo.  Or was she just being so cunty by smoking pot in the lobby?  She's probably being...  Who smokes pot in their lobby? 
[00:27:00]  Really cunty.  But if you like girls, you try to figure out how you could benefit from that.  You don't call the cops.  Look how crazy this is.  Look at the before and after.  She was so sexy, so hot, and now she just looks like a meth head or something.  She had all kinds of plastic surgery done.  Right.  She just stretched out her face with the plastic surgery.  She had implants put in.  Oh, wow.  Where you could tell where the implants are in?  Because they're still long with a fucking ball in them. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I hate that.  And she just...  She's terrible.  She threw a bong out the window?  Yeah.  She threw a bong out the window, and they arrested her.  She's on that same track as Lindsay Lohan.  Oh, she's on the fucking express track.  She's even worse than Lindsay Lohan.  Even worse.  Wow.  I mean, her tweets are beyond bizarre.  Right.  You gotta follow her.  She was bitching at some magazine that posted pictures of her, and she said they weren't  her pictures.  Right.  She's like, look at my toes. 
[00:28:00]  Look at my toes.  I get a pedicure.  And she's just going off.  Jesus.  What is this, old school?  Yeah, this is her...  Crank that up.  This is when she was a kid.  She had her own sketch show.  Where are your batteries?  Oh.  Dildo.  Is that hard?  I know I can get some sleep.  Good night.  Well, you went way back.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is when she first broke out.  Yeah, so...  Jesus.  Dr. C, what's the family doing today?  What activity is planned for today? 
[00:28:30]  Oh, man, we're doing tree climbing.  What do you mean?  Actually, pay a guy to guide you on a tree climbing expedition.  Wait, wait, wait.  What kind of tree?  What, they got spikes in the...  They have to have, like, spikes in the trees and shit.  You're not actually going old school, right?  Huh?  I have no idea.  My wife set this one up.  Safety harnesses?  Of course.  I will read...  And helmets. 
[00:29:00]  Helmets?  Yeah.  Helmets, safety harnesses.  Knee pads.  Knee pads.  They'll figure out a way to suck all the fun out of us.  Why don't you do some of that zip lining?  Yeah, that's...  They don't have that here.  They have everything but that, but zip lining is awesome.  I really want to do that with them.  But you're going to climb a tree?  Yeah, go climb a tree.  You know how old you are?  You're too old to be climbing trees.  Oh.  I'm a little concerned about that, but I guess you just climb it and you look around and then 
[00:29:30]  you climb back down, you know?  Tree climb.  How old are your kids?  Ten and eight.  Oh, man.  They're probably like, why the fuck couldn't Dad take us to Disney?  Yeah, no kidding.  Oh, man.  You had a tough year, huh, Dr. Steve?  Could have fucking...  Not enough people died for you this past year that you can't go to Disney?  Yeah, fuck Test Track.  I'll fucking ride it.  I'll climb a tree.  Right.  Let me tell you something.  This place is like four times more expensive than Disney.  Oh, really?  Wow.  But the wife goes online and what did she see about tree climbing where she said, 
[00:30:00]  we got to do this?  She likes to think out of the box.  Let's just put it that way.  Oh, man.  All right.  Well, that sounds great, Dr. Steve.  Climbing trees.  That's good.  And then shoot guns.  What else?  What are the other activities?  ATV.  Oh, that's right.  You said the ATV.  Well, we got that.  Yeah.  Okay.  Fly fishing.  Your kids are going to fly fish?  Fly fishing.  Yeah. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Well, I took them fly fishing last year.  That was awesome.  Did they catch anything?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  It sounds like stuff you do when you can't go on vacation.  Right.  You go to the Catskills and fly a river.  You go climb trees and fucking, you know.  Right.  Just a little.  I think this place is patterned after the Catskills, to be honest with you.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, but do you realize everything you're doing you could do for free?  Why did you get tricked into paying a lot of money to do the exact same shit as just  finding a mountain on your own?  Right. 
[00:31:00]  Well, that's true.  I mean, if you go to a restaurant, you could just eat at home for free.  So, I guess it's just kind of insane.  No, but what are you getting for your money?  Like, you could fly fish for free.  You could certainly climb a tree for free somewhere.  Depending on what state, you could shoot guns in your backyard for free.  And you certainly.  Oh, one thing that they have here, though, is an observatory.  And they've got a big MFing telescope, and so we're going to do that tonight.  Oh, well, Dr. Steve is very into his astronomy.  He knows that shit. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cool.  All right.  All right.  Fascinating.  Hey, man, I didn't call you.  We didn't need you.  Well.  I love you.  You know that.  But we didn't need you right here.  Back at you, my brother.  All right, man.  All right, Dr. Steve.  Enjoy your week off.  Bye, Dr. Steve.  Yes, sir.  Or your long weekend, whatever it is.  Oh, man.  All right.  Weird medicine.  Dr. Steve.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah, that's what she used to look like.  She used to do the.  To do it to herself.  She used to be on the cover of Maxim Magazine and all that, and now she just looks fucking 
[00:32:00]  ridiculous.  There's another story about her that we have on our sheet, where she got rejected from  a private plane and tried to use Google as ID.  What?  I don't know.  It's one of the ones we get in our overnight.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  She Googled her fucking.  She couldn't get on a private flight.  Yeah, Teterboro.  She probably forgot her driver's license.  See, that's fucking stupid.  Because her driver's license was suspended?  What is it?  Who cares? 
[00:32:30]  So she had the driver's license on her.  Yeah.  So it's obviously, it's the same person, and if you're just looking for ID, but I guess  it's not acceptable ID if it's suspended.  I don't know.  Should be.  Should be is right.  Got all the stamps and shit on there.  Wait, wait.  It was taken.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  It was taken away when she pled no contest on charges of driving on a suspended license.  What does that got to do with flying?  A suspended license.  Did they take her physical license away?  No.  They don't think they take it physically. 
[00:33:00]  It just means it's no good.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Because didn't it just say, though, after she was in court for a suspended license that  they took her license?  Yeah, because if she didn't have the license at all, maybe.  Right, because they might have physically taken it.  Oh, being.  Uh-oh.  Huh?  Is this Kevin Pollack?  Kevin Pollack calling.  Hey.  Hey, Kevin.  How are you, buddy?  Are you in France?  I'm at the Cannes Film Festival.  Oui.  Very cool.  This is very cool indeed. 
[00:33:30]  It is.  What's going on?  I saw pictures of you on the red carpet there.  Did you now?  Yes, I did.  I follow your Twitter.  I'm here with the OOF.  I'm here with the film starring Jerry Lewis.  I play as a strange son, a little family dysfunctional drama.  Yeah, I saw the picture of you and Jerry Lewis.  Pretty cool.  That is very cool.  Especially in France.  Yeah.  You know.  Jerry Lewis.  They love him.  They love him in France.  He's royalty.  He repeated that he hates female comics, though. 
[00:34:00]  Did he?  Yes, he did.  That's in the news today, actually.  We did an hour press conference, and they asked him all kinds of amazing questions.  They even talked about the day the clown cried or whatever for the first time.  He spoke about that and why he locked it up, because he was embarrassed by it and thought  it was horrible.  He finally spoke about that.  And then at the very end, some guy stood up and said, you have said that you don't like  female comedians.  Why is this?  Why do you not like them?  And he actually gave a very eloquent answer, something to do with why we came from a time 
[00:34:30]  when women didn't get on stage and made a fool of themselves or spoke crassly, and it always  kind of broke my heart to see that.  And so it's a different generation or different time.  Anyways, he answered quite eloquently and shockingly.  What makes the press, of course, is that he's once again...  Right.  He's answering a question.  They act like he's just reiterating what he said.  Right.  He would have never mentioned it unless the question was asked, and then he answers it  appropriately, but they have to kind of make it sound like he's a shitty person. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, man.  If it bleeds, it leads, and it's across the board with everything.  Yeah, we assume that.  We assume that by seeing the headline, that he was just, you know...  Shouting for no reason.  Shouting for no reason, right.  And he had a good time.  I saw him at the roast, at the Jack Black roast.  I went to actually get a picture with Jerry Lewis, and Amy was on the roast, and Sarah  Silverman was on the roast, and Jerry seemed to be enjoying both of them very much.  I mean, he didn't seem to be... 
[00:35:30]  He seemed to...  Just yelling, boo!  Yeah, exactly.  Making, like, fake tit things and shaking his head no.  No, he seemed to enjoy them.  Yeah, but also, you know, he's 80-fucking-7, and if you can't speak your mind about anything,  what's the point?  What's the point?  Yeah, yeah, that is true.  You know, you kind of do get a pass at that age.  You're just like, ah, whatever.  Yeah, you forget, huh?  Say whatever you want.  Yeah, he's 87.  If I'm lucky enough to be 87, and someone gives a shit about asking me questions, I'm  certainly going to speak my mind.  Yeah, at that point.  And Kevin, you look terrific, so you're going to make it to 87, sir. 
[00:36:00]  He does.  All right, well, you better be in charge of that.  You look terrific.  Did you send the Tiffany gift?  I don't know what you're talking about.  Here we go.  We're going to have to do this.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Well, there's no one.  I got this wonderful gift, and I can't.  We're assuming it's you, because the card says, can't believe Sam thought it was me.  Enjoy your gift.  Right.  So Sam mentioned to me something else? 
[00:36:30]  No, we got a gift from Paul Anka, but he didn't tell me who it was from.  He said it was from a celebrity, and I predicted that maybe Kevin Pollack was the one who had  said the gift.  But you predicted it in a shitty way, let's be honest.  You got the guy in the phone, so you should be honest.  It was more shitty about this show than it was about Kevin Pollack.  You were hinting that he might have been a little needy and that he sent a gift or something.  I said Kevin Pollack is the only celebrity who listens to this show.  That's what I said.  Okay.  Fair enough.  And that's sort of my answer to all this, is how many fucking times do I have to say  that I listened to this show? 
[00:37:00]  Not only did Sam suggest it was me, but I put Opie on the spot, who thankfully said,  I love Kevin Pollack.  I don't think this is from him, but no.  He does listen.  And then Opie, you went on to say, of course, now he has to send a gift because we've called  him out on it.  Oh, I didn't hear that part.  Okay.  Well, that is backing him into a corner.  Yeah.  No, so I listened to it and I thought, well, this is a perfect opportunity to continue this, 
[00:37:30]  right?  Right.  And then, so then I'm thinking, well, now it has to be a classy Paul Anker company.  It was.  Because I was thinking, you know, I send that Edmonton thing that I fucked up the first time  I was on or whatever.  And then, you know, then I thought I'll go the Paul Anker route.  So I hope it worked and made you laugh.  A, you made us laugh.  And B, you know, in the end, I absolutely appreciate it.  I have to say dumb things on the radio, but in the end, I absolutely appreciate it.  You know that.  The line is, it's not a bad fucking gift. 
[00:38:00]  No.  And that's a great gift right there.  Tiffany, you put your iced tea in there.  You got six nice Tiffany.  Right.  With the blue, and a Tiffany blue glasses.  Right.  Great.  I'll tell you.  I mean, it's more for your wife, ultimately, for the housewares, what have you.  But in keeping with the joke, it just kind of seemed perfect.  No, it's funny.  And the card is so, I can tell you, it's just annoyed.  Can't believe Sam thought it was me.  Enjoy your gift.  Yeah.  Why didn't you fucking.  I think I wrote, enjoy your fucking gift, didn't I? 
[00:38:30]  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  I guess Tiffany doesn't appreciate the blue language, so they left out the fucking part.  Oh, they like the blue boxes.  Yes.  Yes.  Is that it?  You know what would be a funny gift, a really funny gift?  Something to Jim Norton signed by Jerry Lewis.  That would be hilarious.  Or meaningful.  Or would it be meaningful?  Right.  That would be lovely.  Jimmy.  What?  Kevin, how did you mess up the Intimans?  The Intimans.  Coffee cake.  I went to three different stores before I came in that morning, and they didn't have  the exact one that you wanted. 
[00:39:00]  And I said, fuck it.  I can't go empty-handed, so I just grabbed one of them.  And I believe the quote was, yeah, this isn't the one.  This guy is in con.  He's in con hanging out with Jerry Lewis, and he has to deal with our coffee cake demands.  What a life.  I'm going to take a photo of the 47, 200-foot yachts that I'm literally looking at right  now.  Wow.  Really?  Because it is the perfect juxtapose to enjoy your fucking gift. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Have you been there before?  Yeah, it's amazing.  The Usual Suspects premiered here in 95, and that was ridiculous and spectacular.  And, yeah, it's a surreal sort of salesman hocking their wares when you boil it right  down, but then it's set in this stunning, beautiful, ridiculous place in the south of  France.  So it's a Fellini movie.  I mean, it's ridiculous.  It's absolutely ridiculous.  Every aspect of it.  And what do you do when you're not doing the whole red carpet thing over there? 
[00:40:00]  There's a lot of drinking.  A lot of drinking.  Okay.  That's what I was getting at.  It seems like it's one big party.  One big party.  Yeah, no, I mean, it's a lot of parties and stuff with a lot of idiots who are very pleased  with themselves, and everybody's in tuxedos thinking they're James Bond, and of course  no one is.  Of course.  It is the bullshit capital for two weeks.  It really is.  There's nothing but horse shit going on.  Yeah, yeah.  And you can smell it, right? 
[00:40:30]  Oh, God, is it reek.  Yeah, they're not even hiding it over there.  No, no, no.  And it's a European smell, so it's that much greater.  Oh, boy, yeah.  Hey, were you close to that?  What was it, a shooting?  Or was that before you got there?  Oh, it was right before I landed the Christoph Waltz press conference.  Somebody shot off a fake gun, I think.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he was just tackled, I guess.  And then there was also a jewel heist over there.  Well, there better be, because that's actual news.  That'd be awesome.  Yes.  Yeah, there was an actual jewel heist. 
[00:41:00]  Well, you know, again, I'm going to send you this photo.  There are 100, 100-foot yachts that I'm looking at.  Maybe only 50, but it's absurd.  Amazing.  And they're stacked up side by side.  So there's got to be half a billion in jewelry in this small little town right now?  Sure.  Man.  I mean, if I were an international jewel thief, this is certainly where I would be.  We all follow you, so take the picture, and I'll just retweet it.  Okay.  You know?  I'm serious.  I'll do it right now. 
[00:41:30]  It really is absurd.  That's why I would do it.  Oh, that's funny.  Disgusting display of wealth.  Yeah, absolutely.  Right?  Yes.  And a wonderful gift from Kevin Pollan.  Yes.  Better than the Paul Anka gift.  My second celebrity gift, I believe.  Did Anka come in yesterday?  Is that what it was yesterday?  Well, Len, I had to go do a funeral in Rochester, and I think that was Paul Anka Day, so I think  we missed out on the return visit of Paul Anka.  But he'll be back, as Sam Roberts has pointed out, because he doesn't have much else going 
[00:42:00]  on, I believe is what Sam said.  I think he's fantastic and great on the show, and it actually kind of annoyed the shit out  of me when Sam was busting his balls, to be honest with you.  He gave us a great hour.  I didn't say he was bad.  He really did.  And he's of a dying breed.  I mean, him, Rickles, Jerry Lewis, these guys, there's not much of them left.  Right.  They're true old school.  Yeah, and so whether it's kind of hokey and whatnot to Sam, I can appreciate that, but  maybe, you know, have a career of your own first.  Oh! 
[00:42:30]  Nice.  You just got a fucking shot right there.  That's right.  I'll tell you.  From Kevin Pollan.  It's kind of an honor.  Exactly.  We're playing a little game of tennis right now, that's all.  Yeah, that, no, I mean, if you hung with Sammy and Frank and who else was in that one?  I guess Dean.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I think when you write the song My Way, you want your balls busted by a Sam Roberts.  That seems wholly appropriate. 
[00:43:00]  Dude, there's pictures of him on a plane with Jerry Lee Lewis going to fucking do gigs.  Like, that's how, that's how his career went.  He was with Jerry Lee Lewis.  He knew, uh, he, didn't he book the flight that fucking, uh.  Yeah, but that's the other side of it.  He booked the flight that, uh, took out Buddy Holly.  So, you know.  Oh, yeah.  You heard that one, right, Kevin?  Yeah.  I, I don't know why he would offer that up, but he's basically the reason why, uh, Buddy  Holly had such a short life.  Yeah, well, it can't all be good, now it can't. 
[00:43:30]  I forgot how the story went, but basically he, he put that little tour together and, uh,  rented the plane.  Well, he did get rid of the Big Bopper.  And the Big Bopper, so.  That's a hell of an asterisk.  Yeah.  Well, they had to take out, what, uh, Buddy Holly to get rid of the, the Big Bopper.  Oh, yeah.  So, then he's got two asterisks now on the, on the, uh, giant mammoth career.  Yes.  The death of those, the death of those artists, and then his balls busted by a Sam Roberts.  Right, well, the Big Bopper was supposed to be a one-hit wonder, but then he goes down  on that plane, and then, you know, he's considered legendary. 
[00:44:00]  Right.  So, if anything, again, Sam, you might think about.  What?  Did I get to be in good company?  No, as a way to live on forever.  Maybe you want to.  Hey, Kevin, get out early.  Kevin, when, uh, Paul Eker was hanging with that crew, he was a lot younger, though, right?  Yeah, he was the kid.  He was the kid at the table, for sure.  Um, I know him a little bit.  We, uh, we, I can't even remember how he became friendly, but.  We met through some mutual friend, maybe Josh Charles knew his daughter, Amanda, who 
[00:44:30]  I think is married to, uh, Jason, um, uh, Bateman, Jason Bateman.  Oh, okay.  I'm pretty sure that's how I met him.  Anyways, uh, yeah, he was the kid.  He was, like, early 20s when he wrote My Way.  Just a fucking child.  Ridiculous.  How is that possible?  Yeah, that sounds like a more mature song that, uh.  Yeah, to have that type of vision in your early 20s, that's crazy.  Right.  You know, ridiculous.  Yeah.  And you're a big Frank Sinatra fan, right? 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, you kind of have to be.  I mean, Jesus, when it comes to style and bending a phrase and all that crap that I can't even  fathom how to do.  What do you mean, bending a phrase?  What does that mean?  I never heard that.  Uh, you know, he was kind of known for, you take a straight lyric and you give it a different  timing and a different, you know, for comics, it's all about the timing.  So I was always appreciative of anyone who just fucked up the rhythm as you thought the  song was going to go.  And he had that way of stretching a note or in odd times and odd ways. 
[00:45:30]  And, uh, and, and then bending a phrase is a little bit of a, I mean, a great writer.  He didn't write a fucking song, I don't think.  Uh, but, uh, holy crap.  Did he make those songs live forever because of the way he sang them?  And you liked his voice?  Oh, Jesus.  Was there, I guess my, my real question is, was there a crooner that had a better voice  than Frank Sinatra?  All right, this is starting to feel like a bit.  No, no, no, no.  I don't remember if a genuine conversation on the show before. 
[00:46:00]  Sorry.  That's my own insecurities.  No, because it's Paul, like, uh, Frank Sinatra, it's just, it's just a quick question.  That's all.  Who was, who had the, who had the best crooner voice in your opinion?  Cause I, I guess I'm asking you cause it seems like, you know, this world a little bit.  Yeah.  For the record, this is a bit, um, no, I swear to God, sometimes it's just what it is.  Uh, um, you can tell he does listen to the show though, because the paranoia that sets  in when you're actually having a real conversation. 
[00:46:30]  Well, my dad, uh, listened to all those guys and I, I, for one thought Perry Como had a  better voice.  Really?  Yes.  Oh, wow.  Would Sammy count in that or no?  Sammy?  I think Sammy had the best voice out of all of them.  If he counts, if he counts in that.  Do you really?  Yeah.  See, this is why we're having the conversation, Kevin.  I think Sammy had the best voice out of all of them.  Over all of them?  Absolutely.  I thought D. Martin had a better voice than Sammy.  I'm a D. Martin guy myself.  Yeah, I think D. Martin had a better voice than Sammy Davis Jr.  Dino's pretty good.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:47:00]  All right.  Maybe it's getting boring.  What about Tony Bennett?  Eh, never.  Enough with him already.  Enough with him.  Tony Bennett.  The most I enjoy of Tony Bennett is when Alec Baldwin does the impression.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  He was in here.  That's the best possible Tony Bennett.  He was in here and he really believes 9-11 was an inside job.  Yeah, he's one of those kind of conspiracy guys.  And we, uh, you know, we were polite instead of attacking because it's Tony Bennett.  Yeah, yeah.  So we kind of let him slide, to be completely honest with you. 
[00:47:30]  Everyone got off the flight in Cleveland.  Right.  I was like, what, really?  Wow.  Fucking Tony.  That's fucking genius.  That is fucking genius.  He was very nice to all of us, but I don't know.  He wasn't that nice.  I didn't think he was.  You didn't think he was nice?  No, man.  Because we were talking about Liberace.  And I was hinting, did you guys know he was gay?  You know, because I didn't know if the performers knew.  And he was kind of twatty about it.  Yeah.  And again, because he was Tony Bennett, I didn't call him on it, but I was really annoyed. 
[00:48:00]  Like, all right.  I mean, but he's old school where those guys just never talked about that shit.  So maybe he just continues down that road where, you know, that's none of your business.  He would probably, they probably used to say in the old days.  Yeah.  But then, you know, but then again, we're now we're in fucking 2013.  True.  So I'll let you fucking answer the question.  I'm going to sing that dumb song you're popular for.  I shooby-doo-bee-doo.  Oh, fuck yourself.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  Oh, that's fucking good.  Yeah.  He updated.  I didn't miss America until this phone call, by the way. 
[00:48:30]  He updated his music, so he might as well update maybe how he thinks.  Yeah.  He's doing more contemporary shit right here and there.  Yeah.  I wasn't even shit on Liberace here.  You know, I didn't give a fuck.  Yeah.  See, Kevin, that's why we brought up who had the best crooner voice.  Because I knew it would lead to a joke somewhere.  That's how this works.  That's how this shit works in the end, my friend.  Yeah.  But thank you very much for the Tiffany gift, for real.  Can't believe Sam thought it was me.  Enjoy your gift.  Yeah, that's great. 
[00:49:00]  All right.  You're very welcome.  I'm thrilled to be a part of the show in any possible capacity.  So...  I love Kevin Pollack.  He's great.  How's the podcast going?  I'm great.  It's going well.  I mean, we got some great ones coming up.  Spent a couple hours with each guy.  You know, Eli Roth.  Wow.  Who else?  Barry Sonnenfeld was amazing.  I got Michael C. Hall coming up.  Again, spend a couple hours with these people.  You really kind of get to know them.  And that's the fun part.  Are these live audience ones?  Or where do you do them?  No, they're all in a tiny studio one-on-one.  So the performer's ego goes away and you get to the actual meat of it. 
[00:49:30]  And we do all the research.  So then they're like, oh, you're asking me questions nobody asks.  And they like that.  Oh, cool.  Very cool.  I'm behind on your podcast.  I do subscribe.  But lately, I just haven't been listening to podcasts as much.  But I will certainly search out a couple of those in the coming weeks.  Well, I know you guys talked recently about doing a little tour of them.  And I know it's become the L.A.'s version of jury duty is being asked to do somebody's podcast. 
[00:50:00]  That's great.  Yeah, I would love to do your podcast.  Hey, have we featured you on our channel yet?  Please do.  E-Rock?  No, we haven't yet.  We do Friends of the Show.  And we've been doing everyone's podcast.  So we've got to add you to the fucking rotation if you're cool with that.  Yeah, yeah.  Have anybody there email me on how to get you what you need.  Okay.  Whatever the material is.  I'll be happy with you.  Fuck.  Please.  Well, basically, you tell us which ones you want to run.  You know, I'm sure there's ones you really like. 
[00:50:30]  And we'll run them on the channel.  All right.  Cool.  All right, Kevin.  Enjoy.  I have one question for Kevin.  Fuck, fuck, fuck.  Oh.  Yes, yes.  My mind is going, dude.  We were just talking about...  Oh, did you ask Anthony Michael Hall about Full Metal Jacket?  Did I?  Yeah.  Uh, no.  I'm going to...  I think I said I'm going to have Michael C. Hall on the show.  Yes.  Oh, I'm sorry, man. 
[00:51:00]  I thought you said Anthony Michael Hall.  My fault.  Okay, I really misunderstood you.  Poor Jimmy.  I'm...  Are you sleepy?  No, I just missed...  Oh.  When he said Hall, I just thought it was...  Oh, yeah.  Monty.  Do you have a...  I think he interviewed a cough drop, sorry.  Or an old trucking company.  Or a part of the house.  Sorry about that.  I'll be the pinky in your anal cano anytime.  Please.  And then the other four fingers.  Right?  When are you coming through New York again, brother? 
[00:51:30]  The moment I know, you'll know.  I can't wait to see you guys again.  All right, good.  All right, buddy.  Take care.  And don't worry about the crumb cake.  We're good.  Yeah.  All right, cool.  I'm going to take this photo and tweet it out.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We'll do it.  Have fun, man.  Kevin Pollack, everyone.  Thank you, sir.  See you, man.  Yeah, I misunderstood him.  What a good guy.  He really, really does listen to the show.  Yeah.  He's our Hollywood pal.  Yeah.  Jeez.  Michael Bolton is outside fucking things up.  Is that what's going on over at Fox?  I heard the fucking noise when I pulled up.  Music festival series thing that they do every year? 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  They started that shit.  He's the first one, I guess.  Is he out there now?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's he singing?  When a man.  Right.  Yeah.  Heard you.  Which one?  When a man loves a woman.  Oh, right.  He does do that.  Does a version of that.  Do we have that?  I'm looking right now.  Or the other one.  How am I supposed to live without you?  The women love Michael Bolton. 
[00:52:30]  I never liked Michael Bolton.  Oh, this is actually not a bad song.  Which one is this?  He actually, yeah.  Oh, I should know that.  That's why I'm mocking it.  He was like an 80s kind of rock guy for a little while.  And that didn't quite pan out.  And a man loves a woman.  He's got a great voice.  I just never got into him.  Very powerful voice.  A lot of range.  Does he?  Yeah. 
[00:53:00]  He could really get up there.  Who sang this?  Sam Cooke originally?  You got me.  That sounds good, though.  Sounds about right.  She can do no wrong.  Turn us back on his best friend.  I celebrate his entire catalog.  Yes.  So do I.  In a tub with a razor.  I guess you don't have to do it all day.  Of course not. 
[00:53:30]  Thank you, Iraq.  I appreciate it.  Oh, boy.  Man.  What happened?  Miss trial in the Jody area's penalty phase.  Yeah, that hit this morning.  Yeah, they can't figure out.  I guess some people want to kill her.  Some people don't.  Well, you're going to have the God people that will never go for it.  So she's not going to get it.  You're not going to be able to turn the religious people around.  And every jury is going to have a couple of those people.  Another jury is going to be brought in.  Yeah, no, I know.  Yeah, they've got to do that.  And then if they deadlock, I guess the judge decides on life in prison. 
[00:54:00]  Oh.  Or life in prison with the possibility of parole after a certain amount of years.  Oh, he can't give her death?  No.  Oh, wow.  I didn't know that.  She's not going to get death.  You heard it here first.  Because she's pretty.  That's why.  Well, no, because you need all of them to say death.  But don't they get that out in Florida fairly often?  Like one of those southern.  Sometimes religious people don't believe it.  And other times they're like an eye for an eye and a tooth for you.  That is true.  Right.  A conservative religious right are usually for the death penalty. 
[00:54:30]  You know.  No, they're just not going to get a jury to all agree to put her to death.  Man.  It should just be a majority, shouldn't it?  Did she fuck that guy up?  Yeah, look at all.  That's a sketch you never want to be part of.  That slit throat and how many holes were in your back.  That drawing of the guy just standing there.  Yeah.  It looked like a sketch of a cow where they show you where all the meat comes from.  But that's a human being. 
[00:55:00]  Fuck.  Yeah, you don't want to be part of that.  Nah, she's not going to get to death though.  Another jury will come in and there'll be a hung jury as well.  And then the judge will just fucking give her, you know, life with no parole.  You know what else she's done that no one really, not many people do?  She gives fucking interviews all the time.  And I think that helps.  I think when people see it.  Right.  And it makes her a real person.  It's hard to fucking, you know.  And she tests her.  The fact that she's a hot woman though. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  Absolutely.  It's just harder to visualize putting her to death than it is some fucking, some guy  with tattoos or, you know, it's just easier to picture putting them to death.  Do you really think she's that hot?  Yeah, she's sexy.  She's all right.  Yeah, but in the room.  She looked all right with the murder.  Yeah.  She looked all right for, you know.  Yeah.  That's exactly on that scale.  Thank you.  Compared to other people who almost decapitated someone.  Yes.  Here's your other choice.  The two guys in London.  Right.  And OJ.  Yeah, exactly.  It's her or do you want to fuck one of them?  But if she was just on the street walking around, you wouldn't, I mean, she, she's all 
[00:56:00]  right.  She looked a little hotter with the blonde hair, but she was also younger back then.  And then the testimony that she takes it in the ass.  Oh, she did?  Yeah.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  Come on.  She was, come on now.  She's a big fat pussy too.  She's a good girl.  Yeah.  I'd still date her.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Still even now.  What the fuck?  She ain't going to do it again.  And you don't sleep very well, so that's good.  I'd hear her coming.  As soon as I heard that gun cock, I'd be like, all right, all right, I'm sorry.  I was out of line.  You guys play her audio where she's begging for her life? 
[00:56:30]  No.  This is a little old now, but it might be worth playing really fast.  A couple of these clips.  She sounds begging for life.  Yeah, you begged for it.  Well, because at first she said she'd rather die, remember?  Yeah.  And then she changed her tune.  Like, well, if I can't have my freedom, I'd rather just be killed.  And then she's like, oh, what?  You mean I lost the case and now I might be killed?  Right, right.  Well, fuck that.  Yeah, you're not as brave now, huh?  Yeah.  This is the worst mistake of my life.  It's the worst thing I've ever done.  Yeah, well.  I don't think you have to say that. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, God.  I disagree.  Nancy Grace.  I did it for over a decade.  And when they come out stalking out of the jury deliberation room with their arms crossed, some of them are set apart from the others.  There's not that same camaraderie.  She's wearing a button with the victim on it.  The fact that they kept having questions.  She's wearing a button with the victim on it.  She's deadlocked.  Help us out.  Is that?  On one occasion.  She's fucking hateable.  It's so hateable.  That there was going to be a mistrial deadlock. 
[00:57:30]  I found it hard to accept given the gruesome nature of the slaughter.  And when I mean slaughter...  Blow your fucking nose.  No, what's that?  She's not a dumb woman, but she's such a fucking hateable, capitalizing pig.  She is hateable.  She's wearing that just because, well, the victims are always forgotten.  And I guarantee you that's her fucking angle.  Right.  But that's why she's doing it, because it's an angle.  Also, look how high up it is so it doesn't get blocked by the fucking graphic at the bottom of the screen.  Right.  She knows.  Oh, there it is.  Now it is. 
[00:58:00]  The good thing is the evidence is still extremely fresh.  It's almost up by her neck.  I've had to retry a case 14 years after the original trial lawyer tried it.  That's hard putting a case back.  Is there anyone more hateable in news on TV right now?  No.  No.  I don't think so either.  That's a shame, because she's a female prosecutor, so she's knowledgeable.  I don't want to hate her.  Let me tell you something.  She's perfect for a female prosecutor.  She's a cunt.  Yeah.  And they all...  Any female prosecuting attorney, they're hateable. 
[00:58:30]  I can't imagine having to sit there and listen to her just lambast you, lie about you, shit like that, even if you are guilty.  Like, you just looking at her, you're hating.  She is the most hated person in the room, and it carries over.  She's not likable on television.  It's the worst thing I ever could have seen myself doing.  In fact, I couldn't have seen myself doing it.  Before that day, I wouldn't even want to harm a spider.  I'd gather them up in class and put them outside.  Shoot them in the foot?  To this day, I can hardly believe I was capable of such violence, but I know that I was. 
[00:59:00]  And for that, I'm going to be sorry for the rest of my life.  The rest of your short fucking life.  Oh, man.  I was horrified by what I'd done, and I'm horrified still.  And for that, I'm going to be sorry until Tuesday, when you kill me.  Right.  Now, they're not going to kill her.  There's no way.  Now, the jury's going to come in, and it's going to be the same result.  Even if they say death, I mean, the appeals process, all that shit, so many years, and  so many chances for her to get off the hook in that way, so I wouldn't worry about it. 
[00:59:30]  I will concede that with Travis's family, theirs is a much greater loss, and I can never  make up for it.  It's my hope that with the verdict you've rendered thus far, that they will finally gain a sense  of closure.  Steven said he doesn't want to look at his brother's murderer anymore.  If I get life, he won't have to.  Come on.  I've made many public statements that I would prefer the death penalty to life in prison. 
[01:00:00]  Each time I said that, though I meant it, I lacked perspective.  Until very recently, I could not have imagined standing before you all and asking you to give  me life.  To me, life in prison was the most unappealing outcome I could possibly think of.  I thought I'd rather die.  But as I stand here now, I can't in good conscience ask you to sentence me to death.  Because of them. 
[01:00:30]  Asking for death is tantamount to suicide.  Either way, I'm going to spend the rest of my life in prison.  It'll either be shortened or not.  If it's shortened, the people who will hurt the most are my family.  I'm asking you, please, please don't do that to them.  She doesn't sound very sincere.  She really is a fucking horribly insincere woman.  I want everyone's healing to begin.  I want everyone's healing to begin.  I want everyone's pain to stop.  There's no sincerity. 
[01:01:00]  She's a sociopath, obviously.  There's no feeling in that.  None.  Zero.  It's all about her self-preservation because she's in love with herself.  Yes, she is.  That's my professional diagnoses.  I think you're right.  I just got a tweet.  The liberals are anti-death penalty.  Most conservative states are death penalty states.  That's true.  I know that.  I know that.  My point is you've got the individual involved here.  The people protesting are a lot of times very conservative. 
[01:01:30]  And a lot of the religious people are the ones who protest.  We're talking about the jury.  They're not all conservative people.  It's a cross-section.  So you're going to have one or two that are going to be against the death penalty no matter what.  And you're going to have another hung jury.  That's how this is going to work out in the end.  Because you need all of them to agree.  Guilty.  In this case, right?  Guilty.  Why do they all have to agree?  I guess they kind of consider the death penalty kind of a serious thing.  So they're like, it's got to be everybody.  Yeah, but you're not going to change someone's opinion on that. 
[01:02:00]  If they believe that they're against it, that's it.  Yeah.  That's it.  Is that the picture Kevin Pollack just tweeted?  Yeah.  Let me see.  Jesus.  Yacht Row over there in Cannes.  Holy fuck.  What time is it there?  They're all squished together.  It's a few hours ahead.  Yeah, they've got at least, I would guess at least six, right?  Blue skies.  How many hours ahead are they?  They're probably five, six hours ahead, right?  Yeah, that's what I'm guessing.  It's 1.12 p.m.  1.12, so five. 
[01:02:30]  Wait, six, six, right?  Five, okay, six.  Yeah, six hours ahead.  Yeah, yeah, six.  A few months before trial, and by now I need jury selection, my hair was past my waist,  and I donated it to Locks of Love, the nonprofit.  Oh, boy.  They lost their hair.  Oh, yuck.  In fact, that was my third donation to that organization since I was arrested.  If I'm allowed to live in prison, I will continue to donate to that organization. 
[01:03:00]  Wait, wait.  So you should live so you can grow your hair out?  Right.  You should be a hair farmer.  You cut it off every once in a while?  Yeah.  Do it with the cancer kids?  That's who you want.  That's who you want to wear the wig.  See that wig?  That lady cut her boyfriend's head off.  Yeah.  How delightful.  The kid's just crying.  That's a horrible reason to get people to not give you the death penalty.  The fact that you'll grow your hair every once in a while.  Donate my pubes for a merkin.  Yeah.  People that don't have pubic hair.  Oh, she's kind of hateable.  Yeah, yeah.  This is somebody literally begging for their life. 
[01:03:30]  But it doesn't sound beggy enough.  No, it doesn't.  It sounds like a fucking cunty, emotionless statement.  Yeah.  Did you hear this last statement?  Oh, this one's even better.  Uh-uh.  If I get permission, I'd like to implement a recycling program.  The women's prison.  So she shouldn't get the death penalty because in prison, she's going to get everyone to  recycle.  Recycling program for...  She's insane.  I know that I shot your son in the head, but I'm going to have the aluminum cans here.  Yes.  And I'm going to have regular waste over here. 
[01:04:00]  So no longer will they be mixed up.  Paper and plastic will be separated on my fucking cell block.  Just like I separated your loved one's head from his body.  Like his head.  Let's say his head was a can and his neck was a bottle.  Right.  They shouldn't be together.  What a fucking crazy bitch.  What a kook.  I think we can recycle without you, you bitch.  And boy, she really has nothing to beg for her life with.  Hair and fucking garbage. 
[01:04:30]  That's it.  She doesn't sound sincere.  No, she doesn't at all.  Please, I'm sorry.  She's not.  If I get permission, I'd like to implement a recycling program.  The women's prison in Goodyear houses thousands of women and each week, huge loads of waste  are hauled off to a landfill.  Just like you're going to be.  A substantial portion of that could be kept out of landfill and recycled instead.  Are people looking at her just going, what is she?  She cares about the garbage but not her fucking... 
[01:05:00]  This is one thing that could have a far-reaching and positive impact on the community and on  the planet.  That's all she can think of is I'll grow my hair and I'll fucking recycle cans.  And I'll separate paper plastic.  I'm going to start a swear jar in prison so everybody starts to talk nicer.  Every time a prisoner says the F word, they put in a dollar and I get 10 years off my sentence.  That's good.  Yeah, she's not going to get death, though.  Not quite setting up Brooke's library, is she?  No.  No. 
[01:05:30]  No.  Oh, hi.  Whoa.  I hope she doesn't get death now.  She's very entertaining.  She is.  So what's next?  They got to get the new jury in there and they'll have a go at it?  What's going on next with this case?  Yeah.  New jury?  New jury.  Soon?  Like quick?  I guess so.  I heard it on the news in July.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So they got to pick a new jury?  I think so.  And it's the same process.  So I guess they ask them questions and the defense can use their, what is it? 
[01:06:00]  Privilege something?  Privilege.  To throw some of these fuckers out.  They want jurors that aren't for the death penalty.  Of course.  That's going to be the struggle between the two sides.  All you need is one.  All you need is one that just absolutely doesn't believe in it no matter what.  And she skates.  She's not going to get it.  She's not going to get it.  I'm telling you.  I mean, this is a complete waste of time at this point.  This jury heard about a woman that fucking disgustingly murdered some guy and still couldn't 
[01:06:30]  figure it out.  Right.  I mean, yeah.  She's too attractive.  Fat puss.  That goes a long way.  Where's the naked picture of her, Sam?  What are you doing?  From the back.  We got Kevin Pollack's boats up.  I know.  We need naked fucking.  Her tits are awful.  They're like Garfield's eyes.  Are they?  Fucking, yeah.  Big, dumb circles.  Let me see.  Oh, wow.  I never saw this.  Get that bigger.  Can we get that bigger?  Oh, those are pussy pictures right there? 
[01:07:00]  Why are boobs so weird?  Get her pussy pictures.  Did she have implants?  Yeah, they're terrible implants.  They're horrible.  Let me see it, Sam.  Let me see that one here.  Whoa.  What a disaster.  Wow, that's a big pussy.  I never saw that one.  There's too much dirt down there.  God, that's a nice one.  There's a lot of shit going on.  Well, the contrast is a little off.  Yeah, that's just that thing.  She's in the back.  Yeah, that looks like a fucking.  That looks like a rusty veg.  That's an Instagram filter.  Yeah, that's just.  Look at the one from the back.  It's called rust.  There's some rust down there.  I don't know.  Oh, jeez.  I don't know. 
[01:07:30]  Look at how deep that asshole is.  Is that wonderful?  All right, there is a deep asshole there, but there's a lot of rust.  Don't talk about the boyfriend.  He's dead.  Buried him.  Look how deep that asshole is.  I went far.  Yeah, yes.  That is a very deep bung.  Yeah, I should talk on her behalf.  Yeah?  Is that a clit hood right there?  I can't get that picture any bigger.  Oh, there it is.  That is meaty, man.  Yeah, but it looks like she has an extra hole or something. 
[01:08:00]  I don't know what's going on.  Yeah, what's going on way up top there?  She liked fucking dick in that fucking asshole right there, though.  Oh, yeah.  Who took that picture?  Not her.  Yeah.  That's how she says hello.  How do you do?  Hello there.  That's a fine how do you do.  That's her match profile photo.  That's from 08.  08, huh?  That's five years.  I never saw this.  Five more years.  Oh, yeah.  What other pics have we got? 
[01:08:30]  I enjoy a good pic.  Down there, what do we got?  Look at that.  The boobs are really just fucking awful.  Just awful.  Yeah, she looked pretty hot as a moron, I guess.  You went through all those tiny thumbnails right there?  Is that up, up top?  No, keep going.  Keep going all the way.  All the way up.  Those little ones.  No, no, no.  Right there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You went through all...  What is that, a video right there?  What is that? 
[01:09:00]  Let's see the video.  Was that a screen cap from the video?  A screen cap.  Okay.  There's no video, right?  Come on, show the video, Sam.  I want to be honest.  Watch it.  Oh, that looks good right there.  She looks really good there.  She looks really good there.  What a nut.  Look at her eyes.  She's crazy.  She's a nut.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a pretty picture of her.  She's got the blonde hair.  But her eyes are fucking insane.  Right.  You can tell.  Yeah.  Where's that picture from?  The internet?  The internet.  Like, what year and stuff?  I don't know.  Because I don't remember ever... 
[01:09:30]  I haven't seen a picture where she looks that good.  Yeah, that's a good picture.  She looks really good there.  What was her...  What do you think happened with her and her boyfriend?  Was he going to leave her or something?  Like a Phil Hartman situation where the chick just went nuts when he was asleep?  Maybe.  Yeah.  You are wrong about the death penalty, jury.  Let's go to Peter in Jersey.  Peter, what's up, buddy?  Hey, guys.  You were talking about...  Pumpkin eater.  ...where jurors will not vote for the death penalty.  Right.  They have to death qualify any jurors on a capital case, meaning any juror who absolutely will 
[01:10:00]  not give the death penalty or any juror who will give the death penalty, you know, like  an eye for an eye.  Whenever there's a murder, they say it should be the death penalty.  All those jurors are excluded.  Wow.  Look, we learned something today.  So you have to pass that little question.  Yeah, because you're not going to lie.  Right.  Well, they may well lie.  But in theory, you're looking for jurors who will decide on a case-by-case basis.  But wait, do they actually ask the potential juror that question, or the lawyers have to 
[01:10:30]  kind of figure that shit out as they're talking to them?  They ask the jurors that question.  No kidding.  I did not know that until today.  That cuts to the chase, as they say, you know?  If she...  But if somebody wants to be on there and wants her to be dead or not dead, you would just  say, oh, yeah, no, I'm going to be very open to this, I'm going to listen, and then just 
[01:11:00]  be like, yeah, fuck it.  Right.  Well, that's up to the, you know, the lawyers to figure out who's bullshitting, though.  That's why they go through the process.  Yeah.  Hey, Peter, thanks.  I really did not know that until today.  Thank you.  No problem whatsoever.  All right, man.  Peter in Jersey.  I eagerly await the call that says, that guy's full of shit.  Three, two, one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, that fucking last guy's full of shit.  Right.  Yeah.  All right, we got a busy day, man.  A lot of guests coming in.  Yeah.  Annie Lederman's coming in today. 
[01:11:30]  Yes.  Annie.  She's here, and I'm working with her in New Jersey.  Very cool.  And Jeffrey Tambor.  And Mick Foley.  Yes.  What time is Mick in?  Is he in on your 10?  No.  He's coming in at 9 and then staying.  Oh, wait.  He's coming, okay.  Yeah, he actually is a huge Arrested Development fan, so he really wants to meet Jeffrey Tambor.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  He's all in with Arrested Development, so.  Where's Jeffrey Tambor coming in?  Nine.  Nine, nine, ten-ish there.  I will be missing that portion. 
[01:12:00]  Why?  I'm jetting out early today.  I've got to get out of here at 9.  Jet!  I have things to do.  Avoiding Mick Foley?  Uh, yeah.  That's pretty much it.  You've got a problem with Mick Foley, huh?  Yes.  You know, it's legendary.  Who will send the next celebrity gift?  I don't know, but I think it's something you could talk to Mick about today.  You could probably muscle him into...  Well, he might be listening now.  Why don't we suggest he might want to not come empty-handed?  Come by with a little something.  A little something.  I mean, Kevin Pollack, who's been in huge movies, went around New York trying to find 
[01:12:30]  the right crumb cake for us.  Yeah.  Crumb cake.  He went to three different places.  We are crumb cake divas, though, man.  I'll take...  We like the regular Entenmann's.  Entenmann's.  I'll take some of that shit right now if we can figure it out.  Oh, God.  Don't bring it up again.  Be a nice change from the ice cream sandwich.  We really can't find it.  It's obviously difficult to find.  Kevin Pollack couldn't find it, and he's Kevin Pollack.  Just the original Entenmann's coffee cake.  Entenmann's original coffee cake, they sell downstairs.  Well, then we should get it. 
[01:13:00]  Jimmy's fucking acting.  I'm acting.  It's so obvious.  He got way too excited.  Did I?  Yeah.  I probably shouldn't have oversold it.  I oversold things when I'm excited.  I was just waiting for the phone call that says that guy's wrong, but he might not get  it today.  Yeah, maybe.  He actually might really know what he's talking about, which is cool.  Cool.  Cool.  The O.P. and Anthony Channel.  Channel.  Channel.  Channel.  Channel.  On Sirius XM.  Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[01:13:30]  Entertainment for everyone.  Coast to coast, commercial-free music.  We've got you covered.  It's one.  As long as I got my suit in time.  Ozzy's Boneyard.  Eminem's Shade 45.  I'm the real shady.  Elvis Radio.  Wanted through a party in the county jail.  And that's not all.  Outrageous talk.  We've got you covered.  Opie and Anthony.  Ron and Fez.  Tomino and Rich.  Clark says hi.  Jenny Hutt.  Some website.  Plus, the best in politics.  Sports and more. 
[01:14:00]  It's everything the celebrities are talking about.  It's funny, man.  Louis C.K.  You know, when you buy a car, you don't decide what kind of radio you get.  First of all, these are the same fucking company.  It's a merged two companies into one company, right?  Is it a Sirius Radio?  No, it's a Sirius XM.  That's what the company is.  Well, you have an XM radio.  Wait a minute.  But it's Sirius XM.  It makes no sense that it's two different kinds of radios.  What the fuck are you doing?  I have to pay a premium to listen to Opie and Anthony in one car.  And a premium to listen to Howard in the other car.  I would have to pay two premium fees. 
[01:14:30]  How do they expect a customer to understand this?  Sirius XM.  The best radio on radio.  If you can figure out how to turn the fucking thing on.  A plug in my iPod.  I don't give a fuck.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.s.  Fuck you.  Hi, this F.U. is for everyone who calls the F.U. line.  The screaming with rage thing is funny when Opie and Anthony and Jim do it because they have talent. 
[01:15:00]  When you do it, you sound either like a spoiled child or a grumpy old man.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you, every other driver on the road.  I swear to God, it's international drive like a twat.  Hey, fuck you.  Fuck you.  God damn it, chickens.  The goose making me spit out my breakfast sandwich all over my soap with a goddamn My Little Girl's lips line.  Fuck you, goose. 
[01:15:30]  You're a piece of shit.  Fuck you.  This fuck you goes out to Cindy, my deceased father's ex-wife, who just sat there and decided to take every single bit of money she could up until the day he died.  Well, guess what?  He's no longer there.  He's no longer there to save your ass, to fix your cars, to buy your daughter a millionth fucking laptop out of your hair.  I hope you fucking die on it, you fucking crack rot, you cunt.  Fuck you.  To the bitch that took my order at Burger King.  Fuck you.  You do have marinara sauce, cunt, bitch. 
[01:16:00]  Fucking whore.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I want to give a fuck you to Roland for calling you like slobbo and the slobbiest, slobbiest fucking fat piece of shit.  Go fuck yourself, fat boy.  Fuck you.  Yeah, this fuck you goes out to Nicole from the morning mashup.  Nicole, no one wants to hear your scratchy fucking pack-a-day cigarette voice.  So why don't you keep your mouth shut unless you're gonna suck my fucking cock?  Fuck you, mashup Nicole. 
[01:16:30]  Fuck you.  Call the Opie and Anthony SU line.  866-SU-LINE-1.  That's 866-SU-LINE-1.  Sirius XM.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, nice.  Ha!  Woo! 
[01:17:00]  Trying to figure out why E-Rock's playing this.  There must be some kind of way out of here.  Say the joke unto the thief.  There's too much confusion.  Ah.  What's the significance of Jimi Hendrix?  Oh, I got it.  Oh, you got it?  First night game in Major League Baseball was played 78 years ago today.  Ah, that makes sense. 
[01:17:30]  This was very smart, E-Rock.  Very smart.  Yes.  Cincinnati and the Phillies were the first ones to play a night game.  Hey!  Got a very special guest on the phone.  Oh.  Hi, who's this?  Yeah, it's a phone call.  See, I did it for that reason.  I did it for that reason. 
[01:18:00]  Jimmy's face is great.  He backs away from the mic.  He just shakes his head no and is like, nah.  It's the only reason I did it.  It worked out perfectly.  It's like, Jimmy, smell the skunk.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy basically said, no, I'm not doing it.  I'm not doing this.  Bobo, you got to stop tweeting.  I blocked you again.  Oh, boy.  I don't care how many different accounts you make.  I'm going to continue to block you. 
[01:18:30]  Your obsession is ridiculous.  I know part of your brain's missing, but, Jesus, stop it.  Let's just watch this.  Bobo, there.  You're on the show.  You've been talking about calling in.  Go ahead.  What do you got?  Yeah, I've been continuing to be a part of the bus trip, all right?  I'm literally down for anything.  You just got anything to be part of that trip.  But, see, your whole thing is asking for things and begging to be on things.  What do you do?  What do you do?  Like, you call up.  You say you're going to call.  You're going to call.  You're going to tell this story. 
[01:19:00]  You're going to do this.  But then you just ask to be on the bus trip.  What do you have to...  What are you calling in for?  That's what I was calling in for.  To say they'll do just about anything.  Just about anything.  Well, how about you name something?  One thing that would be entertaining.  All right.  Just about anything would be...  How about you stop tweeting about us obsessively?  Okay.  See, this is the Bobo we get. 
[01:19:30]  Right.  When Bobo calls up the after show, we get the energetic back and forth.  He's laughing.  He's singing songs.  He's fucking doing...  And here's the Bobo we get.  Okay.  I don't know.  Well, I'll also be prank calling just about every one of my relatives at ridiculous hours  at night.  What?  Why?  Why would you do that to your family?  The only ones that really give a fuck about you.  For the show.  Why would you do that? 
[01:20:00]  You know, it's a prank call because they hang up on you.  If they didn't hang up on you, you would just talk.  Do you know Jeffrey Tambor was in fucking Taxi and Three's Company and MASH?  This guy was on every fucking show, man.  But did he have those little, like...  Yeah, small little...  Who gives a fuck parts because it was early on in his career?  Very old.  Kojak.  But it's kind of cool to see those people pop up when you watch those old shows.  You're like, holy fuck, that's Jeffrey Tambor.  He was on...  The Roper.  Absolutely. 
[01:20:30]  He was a co-star in that.  Yeah.  You're going to ask him about this?  That's all I want to talk about is what did you do on Kojak?  And let's talk about The Ropers.  The Ropers.  When's it coming back on?  And the Golden Girls he was in?  Like, he was in some great fucking television shows.  Yeah.  He's that definitive character actor for many years.  Just one of those guys, yeah.  Until he actually got a name for himself.  Yeah.  He's always been bald.  Yeah.  That guy must have gone completely bald at, like, 12. 
[01:21:00]  Oh.  Did you know some guy in high school that was, like, already you look and go, oh, wow.  That's bald.  We had a kid in high school that started going gray as a senior.  Wow.  That was weird.  That was stranger than the, you know, the receding hairline.  The bald guy.  We had a guy that had a receding hairline at 18.  Yeah.  But a friend of mine, actually, an old friend.  I haven't talked to him in a long fucking time.  Yeah.  But he started going gray as a senior in high school. 
[01:21:30]  Wow.  I'm like, what kind of stress?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The SATs are making your fucking hair go gray?  That's got to be extremely rare to go gray at 18.  Yeah.  I mean, it was, he was going gray, like, he had, he had a few years left, but they were  popping up already.  There was some chick that had, like, a pure white, like, lock of hair that would just come  from the front.  It wasn't like she bleached it or anything.  Really?  And it was high school?  It was just natural.  Yeah.  Like, what the fuck happened to her?  Well, that side of your, that part of your scalp just decided to die. 
[01:22:00]  Or she fucking, you know, had some goddamn vision or near-death experience or something.  Barney Miller?  He was on Barney Miller.  Barney Miller.  Barney Miller, my God.  God damn, he had a good career.  How old a gentleman is he?  I would guess he's 72.  No, I'm going to guess, hopefully younger, wait.  I'm going to guess 64.  He is 68.  Oh, right in the middle there.  Ah, we got a tie on that one.  That's a tie.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's of that age, though, where he could have been on a lot of those 70s TV shows. 
[01:22:30]  Kojak.  How many guys have you been on Kojak?  Was he in Mannix?  No, that might be before him.  Yeah, maybe a little before.  Well, Bobo, great phone call.  I appreciate it.  Who loves you, baby?  I really will do anything to beat the boy.  I don't care.  No one cares.  This isn't 2001.  2002.  Who cares?  You'll even what?  Eat Mr.  Malonegan's dog shit.  What?  For what?  So you do that, and then we have to deal with you for a week on a bus? 
[01:23:00]  Eat Mr. Malonegan's dog shit.  Don't worry.  I'll behave all right.  All right.  Eat Mr. Malonegan's dog shit.  You'll eat Mr. Malonegan's dog shit?  Yes, I will.  Why would you do that?  To be a part of that trip.  Why do you want to be part of that trip?  Why do you want to be part of the trip so badly that you'd eat dog shit?  Volunteer to eat dog shit.  Kenny was telling me the other day that we're all going to be hating the bus trip two days in. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  And we're all going to realize what a horrible idea it was.  We're all going to be, Kenny, could you book a flight back for fucking asshole of paradise here?  Where are we at with the bus trip?  No bitches.  Yeah, I heard you guys talking about that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We found out that...  Gary's trying to downplay the bitches?  Gary said don't encourage them.  He truly doesn't understand what we do, huh?  No bitches. 
[01:24:00]  In his mind, what does he think is going to happen?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Because he told Troy Kwan not to encourage us?  Yes.  As far as the bitches go?  So in his dumb little mind, what does he think is going to happen?  Well, Ant had some theories as to why he would have said that.  Because he's a fucking homo.  But why...  But doesn't he understand that that just makes good radio?  Of course.  And the reality in the end is we're going to be pretty fucking sad and lonely on those...  Exactly. 
[01:24:30]  ...on those buses in between fucking stops?  Doesn't he understand that?  Apparently not.  Oh.  What was that?  Bobo, it was a terrific phone call today.  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  I really want to be part of that trip.  Good appearance.  It really sounded exciting when I heard about that bus trip.  I want to be a part of it.  Now that Lady Di is back.  What the fuck?  It drives me nuts, this shit.  It's just fucking what I want and what I want.  Fucking just listen to the radio show. 
[01:25:00]  What's wrong with you?  Yeah.  You should be proud of all the great bits you gave us over the years.  And now I think you go back to just kind of being a listener.  You're a pest.  Stalker Patty went back to kind of just being a listener.  But she had an amazing run.  Good run.  She had a great run and we bring her back every once in a while.  We catch up with her.  But back in the day, she gave us a million bits.  You're a pest.  Lady Di is back.  So that Bobo role is kind of filled.  Oh, that's true.  Lady Di.  I've been trying to be back for a long time. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  So?  I really want to be a part of that bus trip.  I'll do anything.  I'm even going to celebrate my driver's license by following that bus if I have to.  You got a driver's license?  Oh, I'm working on getting on it.  I got a learner's permit.  You have zero shot at getting a learner's permit?  The same way that fucking he drives in the fucking driveway slow on Sunday.  Jimmy is so fucking annoyed. 
[01:26:00]  It's the only reason I...  Here's why I'm irritated with Bobo.  Yeah.  Because time and time again, we have fucking told you the same shit, and you still give  your password away.  You still just babble at people on Twitter.  It's like you can't stop being an ass.  It's like, just cut this shit already.  You know what I mean?  I don't mind if you tweet me once in a while.  Hey, how you doing?  But you know, okay, this wouldn't be on the show.  How interesting is that to read?  It's not.  Bobo, comment.  Trying to help you. 
[01:26:30]  I'm afraid they won't be asking you guys on Twitter like that again.  We've gone through this already time and time again, and you still do it.  I've said this many times over the years.  I don't understand what Bobo hears when he listens to this show, Stalker Patty hears when  she listens to this show, and Lady Di, what she hears when she listens to this show.  How is it deciphered in their weird brains?  I don't know.  How are they such ridiculous, over-the-top fans of this show?  I don't know. 
[01:27:00]  It is astounding, though.  Is it just a tone that just happens to...  Oh, you think it's just some subliminal thing?  Just some tone in one of our voices that catches their attention, and that's the real reason  why they listen?  Because they don't really listen to the words.  It's light FM to them.  This is light FM to them.  You think?  Absolutely, because you're right.  They never laugh.  Never.  Bobo has never come on it when that was fun.  It's this desperation like we're on a life raft in a sea of fucking nothingness. 
[01:27:30]  And Bobo, I'll tell you this much, I mean, you know, if people want to follow us as we  do this bus tour, we're not stopping anybody, so...  If they have penises and balls.  If they have breasts, they're not welcome to follow us.  So, I mean, we can't stop you from following us if we do this bus tour.  But you're not...  I can guarantee you're not going to...  Oh, God.  I can guarantee you're not going to be on my bus.  I don't think he should take his driver's license if he gets one, and the first thing  he does is take some cross-country trip. 
[01:28:00]  No.  I think he should practice a little.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I got a friend of mine coming with me.  Who?  Mr. Maloonigans?  No.  Who?  I'll say a little friend of mine in Queens named Doug.  Doug's just...  Let's just say a friend of mine in Queens named Doug.  Let's just say...  Yeah, but no one knows Doug in Queens.  Of course not.  No.  There's a million Dougs in Queens.  Hey, you went through another Twitter girlfriend, huh? 
[01:28:30]  Just whatever.  Whatever.  Right.  Right.  I'm with that.  Why?  Are you incessantly hassling somebody else on Twitter?  Hi, I love you.  Bobo, I got to ask.  You realize these girls don't like you at all, and they're just setting you up, and you  fall for it every single fucking time, right?  Yeah.  Somewhere in your dumb little brain.  Do you understand that?  Yeah, I do.  That's why I'm done with that.  Yeah. 
[01:29:00]  You're finally done with that?  Done with it, huh?  Cool.  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks for the call.  All right.  I'll do anything to be a part of the book.  We heard you the third time you said it.  Repeat it again.  I'm good.  I can get on the list.  Yeah, no, no.  Yeah, exactly.  You want to get on the bus.  You'll do anything.  She said that again, because we didn't quite get it.  Redundancy's good.  At least for one stop to the other.  At least.  And then what happens?  We could drop you off in the middle of nowhere?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got relatives that'll bail me out and get me back. 
[01:29:30]  I just want a piece of that bus trip.  Well, it's up to Anthony.  If he wants you on his bus, we can't say no.  Oh, yeah.  Throw it on me.  I already said he's not on my bus, so it's up to you.  Bo is not married.  And it was made clear there's a married and a not married bus.  Oh, boy.  Please don't behave, all right?  I won't be a burden.  I promise.  Oh, Jesus.  Unlike this phone call.  Yeah, I really promise I won't be a burden, all right? 
[01:30:00]  I think I have that with Brad Pitt has, that face blindness.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  He has a hard time remembering faces.  Like, apparently Brad Pitt, the inability to recognize the faces of familiar people.  He's just an asshole.  Is that it?  Oh, no.  You know who has that?  I hear Martin Sheen has that.  He's very, very bad.  Who are you?  Like, he'll forget the names.  Yeah, he's supposed to be.  Some people are just terrible at that.  I'm horrible at that.  It's also called being self-obsessed.  That's what I'm saying.  Listen, that's why I'm calling him an asshole. 
[01:30:30]  That's just he's self-obsessed and he doesn't give a fuck about other people.  No, no, because I've tried at certain times.  Like, those interns and stuff that come through here?  Right.  I literally, it's not a bit.  I can't remember their names.  Right.  If I see that, like, when it's brought up and it's like, oh, there was this intern.  Remember him?  He did this.  For the life of me, I can't remember who they are.  Because they're not important to you.  That's all it is.  Do you remember who the last intern that did stuff was?  He was Alan Thicke Jr.  Okay.  But see, they have to really make an impact. 
[01:31:00]  But just like casual thing.  Like, there are people around this fucking place that I know their names.  I've heard their names.  But if you lined them up, I couldn't pick them out out of a lineup.  Like management type people.  This is just a made-up thing.  Enough with these made-up things that people have.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're going too far.  Brad Pitt's face blindness.  Face blindness.  And they're saying this is a real thing?  No, it means you're self-absorbed and you don't give a fuck enough to, you know, look around you. 
[01:31:30]  I wish I'd take notice.  I hate your blindness.  Every time the phone rings.  You're right.  We've got to get Dr. Steve on to talk about face blindness now?  Poor guy's on vacation.  Look, I understand we had to add a few more fucking diseases and things to everyday life.  But now we're going too far.  Get the fuck out of here.  Is that upside-down Lindsay Lohan face?  I don't know.  Is that who that is?  Yeah, I don't know.  Yeah.  That's her.  Oh.  I can recognize faces upside-down.  Good.  All right, so. 
[01:32:00]  That's what I could do.  That's my talent.  We'll hang everyone from the ceiling.  Yes.  That'd be terrific.  All right, take it easy, Bobo.  Bobo, it was a great phone call.  Good appearance.  I guess you got your point across, I think.  All right, we really consider it, Anthony.  Wait, consider what?  It's on me now.  Consider what?  I don't even know.  No, being a part of the podcast.  Oh, of course.  That.  Will you have him on the bus, Ian?  What?  The bus trip.  Will you have Bobo on your bus?  Well, you know, things have to be looked at.  Litigation is a problem. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  It's post facto.  Maybe it's corpus.  Say no.  You want to apologize to Jimmy?  Because I think you kind of pissed him off today, Bobo.  Oh, and I'm very sorry, Jimmy.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  I heard you.  So you say you're sorry, and then you repeat the same shit again.  But I really am sorry, Jimmy.  We know.  We heard you.  You don't have to apologize.  Just stop repeating yourself. 
[01:33:00]  Thank you for the call.  And what would you do?  We don't even know what you would do.  Well, for one thing, I'd probably be drinking.  I'd probably be dancing on the bus.  Drinking and dancing on the bus.  On the bus.  Yeah.  And I'd be enjoying all the laughs. 
[01:33:30]  How does that help our trip?  You're enjoying the laughs.  Maybe I'll...  Yeah, we want people that are going to, like, enhance the trip or, yes.  And maybe I'll even bring in a new character called Boston Bobo.  We're not going to Boston.  Oh, my God.  We have to.  Yeah, well, he...  I'm sorry, Jimmy, in advance, but we have to ask.  He's an alter ego.  You have to.  Oh, can we hear Boston Bobo?  Yeah, I heard you.  What the fuck is wrong with you? 
[01:34:00]  This guy just fucking wake me up.  Right?  Just fucking wake me up.  You fuck, I'm not wired.  See, that's it now.  It's just...  That's the only reason to do this.  I hate Boston Bobo.  Hate him.  Jimmy is disgusted.  But I think his character is supposed to bring out hating people, so I think Bobo, he did a great job. 
[01:34:30]  Yes.  Does Boston Bobo sing the Thunder Buddies song?  Yeah, fuck you, Thunder.  You can suck my dick.  You can't get me Thunder because you just got fucked.  I once punched him, beat the crap out of somebody that tried to rape me.  All right, hold on.  I punched his fucking head off.  Hold on, man.  Barbara's on the line.  I think she's a fan of yours. 
[01:35:00]  Barbara.  Barbara in Connecticut.  You're on with Bobo.  No fan, guys.  Absolutely no fan.  Bobo, get the fuck off the radio.  Get a life and stop ruining my morning commute.  You should be tethered in your home next to your mother so she can watch you.  I mean, you're unbelievable.  Get a fucking life.  Bobo.  Listen to the show.  Bobo, this is one of your fans.  There is no fan here.  All right, thank you, Barbara. 
[01:35:30]  All right, we heard Boston, Bobo.  That was terrific.  And I guess that's it.  It was a great phone call today, Bobo.  All right.  I'll just wait and hopefully I'll be a part of that.  Yeah, say it again.  Say it again.  I didn't quite hear it the first.  Say it.  You what?  You'd be part of what?  You didn't say it enough.  Well, he's just summarizing.  He's just summarizing his phone call.  Oh, my God.  Do you want to summarize your phone call, Bobo?  I did.  It was pretty much the whole phone call was me campaigned to be a part of that. 
[01:36:00]  All right.  And hopefully I'll be counting a day.  I'm counting a day to it.  Whenever it is.  Will you shut up?  Holy shit.  It was a fucking crumb cake.  You couldn't find it?  No.  Failure.  They had a... 
[01:36:30]  You couldn't find the crumb cake?  Walnut swirl, if you want.  Walnut swirl?  See?  Why?  Swirl that right up your fucking eyes.  I didn't fuck up crumb cake.  They had a great business going on.  They had to make walnuts swirl.  They had another one with chocolate.  No, of course not.  Sorry, guys.  All right.  How about...  There's a good one.  It's not just traditional.  You know what?  I'm just hanging up.  I just hear how things go over time.  You just...  And this is why you're so reviled.  You just trample. 
[01:37:00]  Over everything?  Over everything.  Right over Jimmy talking.  This could be the worst thing you could do.  Is trampled.  Could you replay that last minute?  And in this moment is why I hope that your fucking phone gets cut off.  Hold on a second.  This is who you are in this next moment we're going to play.  This is your self-obsession.  Is Eric at the board?  Oh, God.  Oh, boy.  No, he was not.  I'm screening the calls.  Why are you screening the calls? 
[01:37:30]  Why?  Because we don't have anybody.  Sorry.  All right.  Well, just play.  I just came back from getting crumb cake.  Play what I asked for.  Okay.  What was it?  Don't roll your eyes at me.  I was actually doing something here.  This is great.  What?  All of you.  The Opie and Anthony Channel.  What's that?  On Sirius XM.  Next week on a very special Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:38:00]  The sex bagel battles his demons.  Everything could be saved if you come in and take a shot.  When he throws a celebration for himself.  Tequila day was my idea.  But when things go wrong, E-Rock gets personal.  I can come with a woman.  You can't.  And the things that usually help no longer do the trick.  Uh, maybe I need a donut.  Humiliating his friends, family, and his wife.  I didn't grab her tits, no.  I don't think she's proud of this particular show. 
[01:38:30]  Then insulting his radio idol.  Oh, turn it off.  Give your final sign off.  Go home.  No one needs ya.  E-Rock's years of radio training go down the drain.  9-0-8, 8-  Try it again.  9-0-8, 8 minutes after 8 o'clock.  Just like a chandelier, I'm hooked on the ceiling.  Here's hooked on a feeling.  And awful cliches are used improperly.  A large go home.  We may get the truth.  And I know, I know, that he doesn't like me. 
[01:39:00]  But when humiliation sets in, the sex man's emotions become out of control.  I don't even know that I'm crying.  Sexy B learns a lesson the hard way.  Next week, on a very special Opie and Anthony show.  Morning BJs.  Sirius XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, God. 
[01:39:30]  So, E-Rock, you cut us off.  What happened?  Why did you get mad?  We went right to commercials when we were ready to, you know, maybe call you out on not being there at the board.  Two of my favorite things happened in that break.  Yes.  It's great.  One, I was telling Ant, there was a time we would try to work the Bobo phone call into some radio.  Yeah.  And now, I will openly admit, the only reason I take that phone call is to annoy Jimmy.  And he did not disappoint. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, boy.  Jimmy's first reaction was like, he smelled the skunk, for real.  Yeah.  He pushed his chair away from the console.  He pushed his mic away, started shaking his head, and just put his head down like, no, I won't.  I'm not doing this.  No.  I'm not doing this.  I always get real into it.  And then he has to do it.  But then, after the fifth, I just want to be on the bus trip.  He pulls the mic up.  Just sing it again.  Right.  Right.  His redundancy is fucking enraging.  He's a redundar head. 
[01:40:30]  He really is.  It's just the same.  Because he talks to himself like that all day.  It's fucking enraging.  And then we wanted you to get something, because he trampled over me.  Yeah, I haven't.  Oh, I know, but that's...  And how come when you're doing a phone call, like, I know you've got to do two jobs at  once.  Travis and Troy, they both can answer the phone, or...?  The phones just started blowing up, so I just ran over there, because I figured you  were going to need those.  Oh, no.  Maybe the Mossad planted them.  Get any shrapnel?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  And then my second favorite thing is when we don't really go to Iraq a lot, and nine 
[01:41:00]  out of ten times, he's not there.  Well, we need him.  He's not there.  And then he gets mad, because we call him out on it, or start laughing about it.  It's like, Iraq, do you got that clip?  But the listeners even know.  I love when we're like, Iraq, play that clip over, and you just hear...  What clip?  What clip?  And then he gets mad that we react to that.  And he's got to know it's coming, because he's like, oh my god, he panics.  I don't know the clip.  And I know it's coming when I say I don't know the clip. 
[01:41:30]  I know we can get a montage of that.  Oh, yeah.  Of that.  Yeah.  Together.  Oh, that'd be great.  Yeah, yeah.  Get a bunch of times Iraq's not at the helm.  It's so strange that the minute...  You think the minute Sal leaves the phone screening room, he would be asking somebody  to take over the phones.  Right.  You would think.  Yeah.  But he never, never does.  And every time it bites him in the ass.  Every time.  It just bites him in the ass.  Yeah.  Oh, god.  That was fun.  I love it.  We got to hear that clip.  Oh, right, right, right. 
[01:42:00]  And if Bobo's trying to garner any sympathy from Jimmy, this isn't the way to do it.  Jimmy's in the middle of saying something, and he just trounces with the exact same thing  that Jim was like, all right.  The exact same fucking, just fucking blithering idiot daughter.  Let's hear it.  All right.  How about, um...  There's a good one.  It's not just traditional.  I don't know what I'm just saying, you know, I just hear how things go over time.  But you just, and this is why you're so reviled. 
[01:42:30]  You just trample.  This is why you're so...  Over everything.  Right over Jimmy talking.  That's...  I don't know.  I wanted to keep...  Whatever.  Wow.  We can keep going if you want.  Of course.  Yes.  Because then it gets to you.  Oh, all right.  Because that's going to take a little bit.  Hang on.  Hatch opened on an engine.  Over everything.  Right over Jimmy talking.  This could be the worst thing you could do is trample.  Could you replay that last minute?  And in this moment is why I hope that your fucking phone gets cut off. 
[01:43:00]  Hold on a second.  This is who you are in this next moment we're going to play.  This is your self-obsession.  Is Eric at the board?  Oh, God.  Oh, boy.  No, he was not.  I'm screening the calls.  Why are you screening the calls?  We don't have anybody.  I love the way he said that.  I just came back from getting food.  Play what I asked for.  Okay.  What was it?  Oh, E-Rog. 
[01:43:30]  It's so fucking funny.  And then he gets mad.  I like the way he said, like, he tries to get us all and put us all in check by coming  back and saying, like, I was on the phone.  It's like very upfront about it.  Very confident.  But it never works.  All right.  Oh, my God.  But Bobo had to say that he was hanging up instead of just hanging up.  Yeah.  He had to.  Should get Annie in here, man. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, yeah.  Annie Lederman's outside doing a little time with Jim Norton this weekend at the Stress  Factory, right?  Yeah.  She's funny, man.  Annie's looking all tight.  Tight and shit.  Yeah.  Take a seat.  Come on in, Annie.  Just grab a seat.  Annie, what's up?  The lovely and talented James Norton.  Oh, you guys look great.  Oh, please.  Yeah, right.  You look so good.  Oh, my goodness.  You look really good.  You look really good.  No, I mean, the whole thing.  The jeans.  Not the tits, though.  That little sleeveless number. 
[01:44:30]  No, that's great.  You're added.  They're added for the radio.  They're in perfect perspective to you and who you are.  I just have the personality of a small titted person.  I try too hard.  I can tell.  That sounds perfect.  I think my whole life is probably in retaliation of not growing tits.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  That's like you based your personality on that.  I think so.  I can say, you know.  That is very important to you.  I see a few tweets about small little tits.  How small, though?  They're really small. 
[01:45:00]  I mean, I'm wearing a padded bra now.  It's not.  I mean, I have more than nipples, but.  Who cares, right?  Giant nipples and just, like, hair.  It's good.  Hair.  Yeah.  Lots of hair.  Do you tweak it?  Like, pull it out, or?  I mean.  Tweak it was not the right word.  Tweezer it.  I mean.  I don't think I'll tweak it.  You said it so slowly.  I could just see your boner rising while you were saying.  Oh, yeah.  No, I just was just.  I'm getting my, a lot of stuff lasered, so.  Oh, really?  Titties are going.  That's good.  Really?  Yeah.  Does laser hurt? 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, it does, but you know, it hurts more, uh, having nipple hair.  Ripping it out?  It's embarrassing.  Is it?  Well, I guess a little bit.  Not too much.  I would think, though, that.  I actually don't, yeah.  If you think there's going to be a situation where someone else might see it, you probably  clean that shit up first.  I just take, like, my dad's razor, his face razor.  Do you?  His electric razor, too.  Do you?  Do you just trim up the nipple hair?  Bah!  That's electric fucking going around that.  I take it to my asshole.  And then, uh, and then, yeah, yeah, you said you're lasering, like, things, so it's not 
[01:46:00]  just that.  Where else?  Yeah, I'm getting, I mean, I'm getting, I'm getting most of the hair removed from my body.  Really?  I'm not going to, like, go completely bare.  That's, I'm not into that.  Right.  But you do, you have to, like, shave.  First, I had to shave my asshole, and I'm staying with my friend's house.  He's out of town, so I just used his.  Oh, that's good.  That's the great opening line to a book.  Like, at first, I had to shave my asshole, and I was staying with a friend.  Like, that was criteria for him to stay with him.  He's like, you better shave that asshole if you're going to stay with me.  But I'm not sure if I'm going to tell him or not about it.  Yeah, yeah, let him use it. 
[01:46:30]  That's like that old gag, the urban myth about the toothbrush and the camera.  I don't know what that is.  People go on vacation, right?  And they're in the hotel room, and they come back to their hotel room, and my God, everything's  been stolen except their camera and the fucking toothbrush.  It's like, what the fuck?  Oh, this happened to somebody, I know.  They go home.  Oh, yeah, sure it did.  Sure it did.  And they go home, and, um.  Well, they're very thankful that they didn't steal the toothbrush as well.  Right, right, right.  Who would be thankful for that?  I know, I know.  They go home, they have the film developed.  It tells you how old this myth is.  Uh-huh.  And, uh, they see the, um, bad guys, the guys that stole everything. 
[01:47:00]  One picture of them with the toothbrush up his ass.  I mean, that's.  Now you've taken the toothbrush, and you've used it, because it's the only thing left.  That's like a Friday night for Jim.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's my own hand holding my own toothbrush.  Now the story goes, there's bad guys, they, they steal some shit, they leave the toothbrush  and your camera.  You check the pictures, you see a picture of the guy with the toothbrush up his ass, you  throw the toothbrush away.  You go to the cops and say, this is the guy that robbed my house. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, it's not.  It's the digital age ruined that whole fucking gig right there.  Right.  That whole little gag.  I mean, well, wouldn't just taking the picture have ruined it too?  The developed picture?  Yeah.  Or you've waited so long that they.  They're so gone by then.  You probably would have brushed your teeth by the time you got it developed.  Like, with a digital one, you would look at it immediately.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But they're like, oh, they left the toothbrush, thank God, let's continue using it.  I like, I like the idea that they fled the country.  This is, they're just such high.  Well, you usually flee the country because you're on vacation, so you're probably in the Bahamas  or something like that and some Bahama guy, the guy that makes the coconut drinks on the 
[01:48:00]  beach, let's say.  He's the guy with the toothbrush up his head.  Well, it was mad because you didn't tip him.  Right, you didn't tip him on it.  You'd poke in your room and shove something in your ass hole and photograph it.  I feel like I probably would have gotten raped and murdered if I was the one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'd be like a little bit offended if they just took my shit.  And then they'd leave a camera with the pictures of the rape on it.  They'd blur out the nipple hairs.  Did anybody ever comment on it negatively?  On what?  You said like you're an asshole.  Did anybody ever say like that? 
[01:48:30]  No, I don't.  I'm not like, I mean, I take care of myself, but it's like I would like to not have to  like wax and do all that shit.  It's such a pain in the ass.  It's so annoying.  But I thought it was funny because when you go, they ask you to, you have to fill out  a form.  Thank you.  You have to fill out a form and you have to put like your emergency contact.  So I just put my dad just in case.  Just in case.  It's like what could go awry when you're having your ass waxed?  Like Mr. Letterman, your daughter's asshole.  There's been a problem.  She couldn't laser to death. 
[01:49:00]  Where do we send the rectum?  A laser.  I guess that is embarrassing for a woman.  It's like you got to do something that's not supposed to be happening with your gender.  Like that's how we think is like if guys do something we consider feminine.  I say if we can, you know, who hasn't done shit we consider feminine, but then it's  embarrassing.  It's kind of the same thing.  I mean, it's not, I mean, I'm not like, I feel like maybe I'm painting a little bit  of a picture here, but it's not terrible, but she's trying to say it's not that hairy.  I mean, she's just trying to keep it all nice.  I'm trying to cover my tracks here. 
[01:49:30]  You're a fair haired girl.  I would think.  I mean, I'm a monster.  I don't know.  I would think it wouldn't grow in.  It would grow in wispy.  Like, look, your arms.  Wispy, yeah.  Your arms aren't crazy.  I sometimes look at girls' arms and I'm like, that must be a rugged bush down there.  Like girls that are really.  But what's a wispy bush?  Like a Farrah Fawcett, like feathered?  Yeah, yeah.  Feathered back like that.  Right.  Look.  70s look.  We have to kind of part it to get to the action.  Yes.  I like shaved, but I recently, like I found a girl online, a porn star, who I talked about 
[01:50:00]  on the air and her pussy was massively hairy.  Well, can we show Annie?  Bianca Stone.  Jimmy makes it sound so, you know.  But she has, she's a hair model.  That's what she does.  A pussy hair model?  Yeah.  Pussy hair.  You have to see how brutal this is and Jimmy's into it.  But she has a big, big vagina, too.  Her pussy is great.  Jimmy likes that.  Look at that.  Look at her.  Look at her.  That's sad.  It's rough.  It's like it's crying.  Oh, it looks lovely.  It's rough.  I mean, it's like all the way down her fucking legs. 
[01:50:30]  All the way down her.  Right.  The hair on the sides like that.  Maybe above a little bit.  Just a little bit.  Yeah.  Maybe above a little bit.  I say you leave like an extended Dorito.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But that's side shit.  That's a little much.  I mean, I guess that's what Jimmy's into.  And do you like the hairy armpits, Jimmy?  I forgot to ask.  Not as a regular thing.  No.  But like as an occasional sexy thing.  Yeah.  It can be dirty.  Yeah.  It can be really.  It can fucking.  Of all the shit I've heard you say, that's the grossest. 
[01:51:00]  Really?  Really?  Get shit on by a tranny.  That's fine.  That is fucking weird.  No, it's not.  It's like there's something animal about it.  There's something.  She has good tits.  Yeah.  She's got a great body.  And look at the vagina.  It's fucking amazing.  Why?  What's it?  It's like a snuffleupagus coming in.  The pussy?  Yeah.  Exactly.  But I'm saying the leg hair can be easily taken off.  That's easy.  You can just shave that off.  I mean, I kind of feel like the truth is, and like, I obviously succumb to it, but it's  like, I feel like it's like at that point, if you're like, have anything to do with my 
[01:51:30]  pussy, you're welcome and go fuck yourself if you have like a problem with it.  But, you know, you got to wear a swimsuit sometimes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was reminiscing.  You can't be wearing board shorts.  I was reminiscing, kind of waxing fantastic about the old days where you really had to kind  of move in there and get everything out of the way.  And find everything.  Just a full fucking.  It was a treasure hunt.  Womanly pussy with the hair and everything.  This is before people fucking shaved.  You know, we would talk about that.  Like, if you went out with a girl and you finally got to go down on her or something 
[01:52:00]  like that, even shove your hand down her panties and she was shaved, you would be like, I'm  with a porn star?  What the fuck is this?  Like, a girl had to be insane.  You would think she fucked everybody if her pussy was shaved.  No, it wasn't even.  It wasn't even.  Yeah.  But it wasn't like you would say you were with a porn star.  You would say I'm with a freak because it was before the porn stars were doing that.  They all had hairy pussies in the 70s.  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  But every once in a while you came across one that didn't and you're like, wow, this 
[01:52:30]  is a far egg.  But I kind of remember that.  And it's like, I was thinking, man, if you're really into that, it's not into like big hairy  down the legs and stuff, but just the natural girl's vagina with the hair there and everything.  If you're into that, you're out of fucking luck.  You're shit ass out of fucking luck these days.  I mean, I would like, I mean, it's, it's a nightmare to have to upkeep.  It's a fucking nightmare.  Let it grow.  What's wrong with you?  Fuck you.  Just let it grow. 
[01:53:00]  No.  I mean, you can't.  Oh, why, Jimmy?  Because you gotta, you gotta go back and forth.  Society tells society.  You gotta, you gotta shock them.  You gotta go back and forth.  Is that it?  If I go back to re-bang someone, I gotta have a different look.  A different look, yeah.  Yeah, so keep it.  I feel like it's been a while.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't, I wouldn't want that all the time, though.  Like, I would, she, I'm sure she shaves it for certain.  You could find pictures of her pussy.  Yeah, but I'm sure she, that's more fetish oriented.  She'll leave her armpits hairy, and it takes ten seconds to fix that.  It's rough.  Oh, that's rough.  The leg hair is really gross to me. 
[01:53:30]  That's the worst part to me, is leg hair.  The pussy and armpits, though?  Oh, I'd fucking take her to the beach and do jumping jacks together.  You wouldn't, Sam?  No.  No, that's rough.  You don't like that?  That is rough.  There's too much dirt down there.  No, it's just...  Look at her, like, it curls over her pussy, too.  That's the theme today.  Too much dirt.  Too much rust.  Yeah, I'm not a fan of that whole look.  It's kind of...  And it does.  It looks like dusty.  Her pussy looks like Rob Zombie.  It looks dusty. 
[01:54:00]  Unkept, hairy.  She's Lebanese.  Yeah.  She's Lebanese.  Is she?  Yeah.  She's Lebanese.  Yeah, I believe so.  It has to be.  She's some nationality that's not...  She's not, like, Irish.  All right.  So, if you're not Irish, you're Lebanese.  Yeah, so that's the next, you know, fucking...  Okay.  Right there.  Anyway, Annie Lederman is here.  I don't know if she wants to talk about hairy pussies the whole fucking time she's here.  It's Letterman, and of course I do.  Is it Letterman?  I fucking...  I say Letterman still.  I still fuck that up.  That's because everyone thinks Letterman has the T's in it. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, you don't have the T's.  I obviously don't.  All right.  So, we'll make sure we fucking don't fuck that up.  Yeah, thank you, guys.  Annie Letterman.  I can't...  You've been calling me the wrong name the whole time?  I, when he said Annie Lederman before, I was like, yeah, Annie's coming in.  Like, it didn't even strike me that it was wrong.  You must get that a lot, though, right?  Yeah.  When people call you Ed Norton, I don't say anything.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  I don't either, except thank you.  Finally, somebody recognizable.  Oh, you want to talk about humiliating?  Oh, I went to...  My friend was a stripper years ago, and I went to see her at a strip club.  It's this fucking cocksucker. 
[01:55:00]  Like, I think it's...  I don't want to bash the name.  It's like on, like, 33rd Street.  So, I get down there, and she leaves my name at the door, and they don't want to let me  in because I have ripped jeans.  You know, it's like one of those fucking dumps.  Like, yeah, classy for the ladies.  Is it classy, really?  Shut up.  And they send the bouncer down, and I'm like, well, she's a friend of mine.  She put me on the list.  So, they send the manager down, and he looks, and he goes,  yeah, she said, he said, Ed Norton's here. 
[01:55:30]  And they looked at me, and they're like, you're not Ed Norton.  And I'm like, no, I'm Jim Norton.  So, she gave my name, but they put down Ed Norton, so they thought a big celebrity was  coming in.  So, they were going to make an exception, but then they realized it was me, and he was  like, well, if you get better pants, you can come in.  Better pants and go into a strip club?  Fuck you.  Did you go to Kmart real quick and then come back?  Yeah, a nice pair of khakis.  Is there anything sadder than if you did that?  No, I didn't, though, but I actually did go see her at another club.  Yeah, at another club.  Yeah, just another place.  They got my business.  Why wouldn't you say what fucking cock shithole this was?  I can't remember the name. 
[01:56:00]  Oh.  I don't want to say it's, I might be a place called Rick's on 33rd Street, but I don't  want to badmouth a club if that's not the one.  Well, they all have that policy with the stupid ripped jeans.  They were dicks, though.  They were dicks.  Well, most of the guys are trying to spill semen in their fucking pants, but they're a  classy joint, right?  Don't try to make it like it's a class jerk.  They're afraid the cum's going to come out of the holes in your knees.  Want to keep it all fucking clean.  Keep it classy.  Like, Chappelle had a funny bit on that, about wearing a hat in a strip club.  How you fucking, you know, you didn't know how to do that either.  Class it up for the ladies. 
[01:56:30]  Look up Rick's on 33rd Street, Sam.  I want to see if that's where it was.  Because it was really enraging.  Yeah.  Yeah, they just weren't nice.  They never are.  Most places, they're not that nice.  You feel at any moment, you could get the shit beat out of you.  Yeah, you're going to get beat up or fucking thrown out.  For what?  You know, I looked the wrong way.  My finger brushed against her leg when she was, did you fucking table dance?  I mean, I can't imagine that's what happened to you.  I can imagine you, Anthony, going in.  I fingered her. 
[01:57:00]  What's the...  Yeah, what happened?  Right.  She said no.  Whatever.  My finger slipped in.  My blood pressure goes up, and it's not for the good reason.  Because you feel like these fucking guys are watching you every move.  These mooks.  Oh, God.  It's exhausting.  Oh.  I mean, that's a weird...  Oh, what do we got here?  Hello.  Hello there.  Well, now.  Well, now.  Oh, man.  Is that it?  I wish.  I wish I looked just like her.  Oh.  She's lovely.  Oh, you.  I like her fake teeth.  They are pretty fake.  It really is now. 
[01:57:30]  Fake teeth kind of look like they smell, though.  They're so weird.  That's retouched.  Oh, they might.  They look like they smell.  Fake teeth.  Yeah.  Because it's like pockets or something underneath.  Something about it looks gross to me.  What are you talking about?  First of all.  Somebody smokes, and they have fucking dental implants.  That's what John Gotti, I think, got sick from.  I think he got mouth cancer from, you know, he had dental implants and smoking.  Yeah, I think that's right.  What?  Really?  I mean, did you Google people that need them? 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, really?  What the fuck?  They look like shit, though.  They look awful.  There doesn't look like there's any, like, lines in between them.  You're absolutely right, man.  Did Jean Benet just come up?  Oh, I remember her.  Yeah, because she used to put the fake teeth in for the pageants.  Did she really?  That's not Jean Benet.  All those little, uh...  That's a different one.  No, that's a different one.  Yeah.  One of your toddlers and Thierry girls.  That's a toddler and Thierry.  But all those girls put in the fake teeth.  Yeah.  They put in fake teeth in children?  Yes.  Yeah, because their teeth are falling out.  They can't be beauty queens with their teeth falling out.  They do fake ones.  Like, they don't stay in permanently.  Yeah, it's called a flipper. 
[01:58:30]  They put them in there.  He's got a little lingo.  Of course he does.  He knows such a pervert.  He knows they're called flippers.  Of course he does.  Every time he's heard that word while he was fucking wiping out his own belly button.  Fucking duck walking to the...  Where's my flipper?  Oh, it's between my legs.  It's just when they put them in your dirty Italian pubes, your flipper collection, every  time you shave, you hear like six plates, flippers hitting the bathroom floor.  Little flippers fall out. 
[01:59:00]  The fucking parents of these kids should literally be killed.  It's unbelievable.  Is that show still on where they finally move past that shit?  I don't know.  I haven't seen any new ones.  Well, now they have their breakout star.  Yeah, yeah.  Honey Boo Boo.  I love that family.  Honey Boo Boo.  I've watched it once.  It's actually good.  Like that family is like, they like don't give a fuck that they love each other.  They really don't give a fuck.  You're kind of right, man.  And they're like disgusting and they don't give a fuck.  And it's like awesome.  Fat and farting and just fucking...  Right.  It's great.  It's like my family but less white trash. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, Honey Boo Boo is...  And Honey Boo Boo is gaining fucking density by the day.  When was she honey?  She was honey before?  She had a little honey to her.  Uh-oh.  A little honey...  No, I'm not into that shit.  But I'm just saying that she's fucking starting to look a lot more like that.  That beast of a mom of hers.  I mean, her mom is just insane.  But they're...  I mean...  She lost what little cuteness she had.  Did you see the living things in her toes?  Oh, gross.  Remember when she had those fucking maggots in her feet or whatever?  How the fuck do you sleep at night with those things tickling your toes all night?  If I think there might be a bed bug, I have to change hotels. 
[02:00:00]  She had a fucking colony in her toes.  Yeah, man.  They were fucking attacking her toenail that's no longer there or something.  Nats.  What'd you call that foot again?  The forklift foot?  Forklift foot.  Forklift foot.  Oh, my God.  That's so awful.  I'm very protective of my feet.  I got run over years ago when I worked in my house.  Run over by a forklift.  How do you miss that?  Yeah.  Yeah, right?  I understand you run over a little kid. 
[02:00:30]  Watch when she takes the sock off.  You see the bugs attacking it.  Oh, look at this.  There's just bugs and shit living among her toenail.  Look at it.  I feel like that's not real.  Look at that foot.  Wait.  Oh, my God.  Where's the bugs?  I can't see them.  They're screaming.  They showed it the first time.  Now she's using her sock to shoo the bugs away.  Forklift foot.  Least of her problems. 
[02:01:00]  How do you put your shoe back on and go about your day knowing there's fucking  bugs in your toenails living?  I don't know.  Your toenail bed.  Her attitude's just like, lay off.  Like, leave me alone.  So I got maggots in my toe.  She's the best.  Can you imagine?  She'd never get her asshole lasered.  Fat people's hands and arms and stuff look like babies.  They got that fucking line where every joint is.  Like an articulated doll.  Dimples?  Yeah, yeah.  The dimples in their fingers and their knees and shit.  They're just fucking... 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  I mean, there's a guy out there maybe in this room that just...  That's his number one.  That's...  Nothing could be more attractive.  Right, right.  I wish that was a fetish from mine.  I wish I loved fatties because they fucking certainly love me.  I would be a wonderful...  My friend Dean used to love fat girl.  He loved fat girls.  He actually loved them.  Loved the...  That's where I got the thing about armpits smelling like lamb.  I got that from Dean Miller who was fucking passed away.  He liked that.  Loved it.  Loved a big fatty.  Couldn't fuck a fat enough girl.  Oh my god, really? 
[02:02:00]  Because you didn't want them to leave.  You might do one every once in a while for a goof, but...  No.  For it to be your thing?  I can't do it, dude.  Fuck.  For a goof?  Was like someone like pranked you?  For a goof.  For a goof.  So you got a story.  So you got a story for your friends.  I feel like I might have been the fat girl up sometimes.  No way.  At points.  Oh, in college maybe.  Were you a little chubby?  A little post-grad.  When I was drinking, I was pretty...  Yeah?  You were chubby.  Pretty bloated?  I was bloated.  I was Jaeger bloated.  Jaeger bloated.  Just filled with Jaeger. 
[02:02:30]  Just such a...  And I thought I was really hot.  That was the problem.  Yeah.  I had like a scooter.  I lived in New Mexico, so everyone in New Mexico is pretty ugly.  So I thought I was like great.  I was just like cruising around.  So gross.  I had...  I would always fall off my scooter drunk.  And so I would have like wounds on my face and stuff.  I just thought I was so hot.  Whatever.  I have stitches in my chin.  There is something pretty sexy about that.  I had road rash all over my tits.  That's great.  I was born on my titties.  Fucking disgusting.  That's fucking fantastic.  It is fantastic. 
[02:03:00]  I thought I was great.  There's something sexy about that.  The chubs have...  Banged up girl.  The chubs have to have youth on their side, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So they don't smell like lamb.  Oh, Dean.  Jesus.  Dean was the best.  Oh, my God.  If there's a fatty, but she's young, that's fine.  Do you like the lamb smell?  No.  I like...  I like...  On a person who I have a chemical thing with, I love the smell of armpit and their  pussy and their ass, but it can't be filthy or gross.  It's got to be natural, and it's got to be somebody who I chemically like.  It's weird.  Because on some people, I don't care what they do, the fucking smell of their body grosses 
[02:03:30]  me out.  But if I have a...  If they hit that animal part of me, I don't want deodorant.  Just put your fucking pits in my face.  Wow.  Yeah.  I like that when the pheromones match.  I mean, I've never dated anyone where I've had that.  I've just slept with monsters.  You smell like shit.  I mean, just trapped with them.  Yeah.  And they move in with you, and your whole house smells like garbage.  Oh, fuck.  It's disgusting, but...  And even if it's not a dirty smell, even if it's...  Yes.  It's just their smell sometimes.  Yeah.  It's just not right. 
[02:04:00]  It's a deal breaker where you just know you're not going to match up.  If I fuck you and I, like, don't move at all, you have the gross smell.  Wow.  Like, if I just...  If I'm just, like, I can't...  You don't want to get the wind going?  You don't want any fucking, like, air moving?  I mean, if I'm...  Yeah, if I'm just...  Yeah, just slaying.  Closing my eyes.  Oh, wow.  Does your ex not smell good?  He just smelled off.  It was, like, totally wrong.  And I knew it from the beginning, and I fucking stayed for a while.  How did you know it?  What part of him smelled?  Was it his neck or his...  His neck.  Really?  Yeah.  I mean, he was a bigger guy, too, so he might have had a little lamb involved. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, shit.  It smells like lamb.  That's hilarious.  Dude, weird smells come...  Lamb's good, though.  Lamb is good, but not when you're in a fuck mood.  Like, when you're looking to fuck, you don't want to, like, all of a sudden crave mint jelly.  There's just something wrong with that.  Slap some mint jelly.  There's a lot of people who disagree with that.  Yeah, I'm sure there are.  Not maybe a...  Not a dead lamb.  I was...  Like the little blow-up ones?  I was fucking with this girl one time, and I was very attracted to her, and I'm kissing  her neck, and her ears smelled. 
[02:05:00]  What?  It smelled like putrid earwax.  Oh, my God.  Like a rot.  It was almost...  And she had an earring, so I'm like, is it?  Because her earring is...  Infected?  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure.  I had my nipples pierced, and there used to be this shit that would come out of my nipples.  Oh, no!  Really?  I mean, I'm just trying to give people boners here.  Let's talk about my ass hair and my nipple juice or whatever.  What made you decide to get your nipples pierced at once?  I just had no tits.  I thought it would be, like...  Yeah.  I was 14.  I was like, this will make it better. 
[02:05:30]  14?  Who pierced your nipples at 14?  Who's the lucky ducky?  That's what I thought.  That's a big fat woman, actually.  She looks like her.  At South Street Tattoo, in Philly, would always pierce and tattoo kids.  Really?  But it was weird.  I remember thinking, I was like, this is so cool.  She's doing this.  And then I remember, it was like my baby titties.  She was like...  I mean, they haven't grown, but she's like, you know, it's like, that's why it's wrong.  Like, she was touching my tits.  Of course.  Imagine if I was like, pierce my clit.  Yeah, yeah.  Get my cervix.  Like, let's go. 
[02:06:00]  All right.  But she, I remember she dropped the needle at one point, right before she put it in one  of my nipples, and she went, Butterfingers.  And she picked it up and just used it?  And then she used it again.  All right.  See, that's probably not right.  Well, that's Philly.  That's Philly, though.  Yeah, it's Philly.  That's normal shit for Philly.  South Street?  Are you kidding me?  They're very earthy people in Philly.  Oh, God.  They don't give a fucking South Street.  Yeah, clean on your shirt.  When you're like a juvenile delinquent, and then you, like, the people you think you're cool  when you're a kid, and then you grow up a little bit, and you're like, that's  whore.  Like, that woman's terrible.  She's an awful person.  I wonder if she's still there. 
[02:06:30]  I mean, maybe not after I said her name.  Yeah.  Get her out of there.  No, I mean, whatever.  It was fine.  I mean, someone would have done it.  And then what?  So it was leaky?  No, it didn't leak, but there was just always a little...  Gunk.  Did I actually gross you out?  No, I'm just thinking of something leaking out of the nipple.  A little gunk.  And I'm remembering that ear smell.  I wanted to fuck this girl so badly.  And then that fucking...  It's all I think of when I think of her not.  I don't care how many pictures of her pussy I've seen in her body.  She's beautiful.  Wow.  But that fucking ear. 
[02:07:00]  Right.  I wanted to...  And you can't...  There's no way you can hint to somebody in their ear.  I pierced my ears fucking so long ago.  It's embarrassing now.  Really?  But every once in a while, I'll get little cylinders of shit that come out of them.  And I haven't put a fucking thing in my ear holes in fucking decades.  I don't know if it's wax that builds up or just dirt or grease.  Every once in a while, I'll feel like it's a little like solid and then I'll work it  and a little cylinder piece of something comes out.  Does it smell?  It's so disgusting.  That's what I'm assuming would smell. 
[02:07:30]  Next time I'll smell it, I guess.  Well, you got to, man.  It's just a very extremely thin cylinder of this like...  It seems like it would be some kind of hard waxy thing.  You should keep it and bring it in.  I'll do that.  I'll fucking do that next time.  It's probably like oils and sweat and stuff that kind of wicks its way in there.  Or...  Well, I mean, I'm sure there's a lot of really disgusting stuff inside our bodies.  Yeah, but you expect it from someone's mouth can stink or someone's asshole or pussy or  their balls, I'm sure.  But what about...  All in the same spot at the same time. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, exactly.  The same special girl.  But I mean, there's all these things that can stink, but it's weird when you find one  in a place you're not expecting to find a weird stench, like a nipple or a fucking ear.  A knuckle.  Did the rest of her smell good?  I don't think I ate her pussy.  And the rest of her was fine.  I mean, I don't think there was anything wrong with her.  She turned me on, but except for that, that was just fucking...  Hey, did the piercings fuck your nipples up?  No, they're fine.  They're not numb.  So they're not out...  They're not still in there, right?  No.  Yeah. 
[02:08:30]  And it closed up and everything's fine?  Yeah.  Everything's fine.  I don't know.  If I ever have kids, which will be a terrible mistake, we'll see.  You wouldn't get your breasts done, are they?  You wouldn't do that.  No, you shouldn't.  I always encourage women not to.  I hate when I hear women like...  You've never...  I've never...  We don't talk about this stuff, but I'd never encourage women to get bigger.  We went through a period where we saw naked girls almost every fucking day in the show.  Yeah.  And it was like one out of ten of those boob jobs look good.  Yeah, they look...  One out of ten tops.  I would say ten percent. 
[02:09:00]  They all look kind of good with when they had some...  With clothes on.  Clothes on, but when they took that top off, oh my God.  We saw so many horror shows.  Girls that went...  Try to go from like an A to a D.  Those tight ones?  Remember those tight ones?  They cut your fucking nipples off and they shove like a foreign object and it's so crazy.  The scarring.  And then they sew them back on.  Maybe they've gotten better since we did this on a regular basis, but the scarring.  Remember the horrendous fucking Frankenstein scars we would see?  You'd get those too.  I like the strippers that wouldn't even let them heal. 
[02:09:30]  They want to get out there and fucking work those new tits.  With the scabs.  And it's just...  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  It's all red and raw, fucking Frankenstein-y.  What about the girl that used to do our show and she would blow up her own boobs with the saline?  That fucking chick was...  Whatever happened to her?  A lunatic.  She's got to be dead.  Did she have long black hair?  Yeah.  Yeah, but she...  She's dominatrix?  Yeah, I think so.  I think so.  She had those big over-the-top duck lips.  Horrible though.  Way over the top.  I don't like when people get their lips done.  It really...  The lips and the teeth are like the worst for me.  If you want to get like a little nose job or something, if you want to do like something little 
[02:10:00]  and I can barely notice, I'm for it.  A little Botox, I guess.  I'm probably going to have to get it.  I feel like every fucking person has it.  But it's like...  Ugh.  Yeah.  The lips...  They don't have a line.  It's unbelievable.  There's no longer like a line of demarcation between their lips.  It's like rounded.  It looks so fucking weird.  Rounded and big and puffed.  And they think it looks good, I guess.  It looks like you got beaten.  Yeah, yeah.  And they continue to get it done knowing what it's going to look like.  They have to know from the women that have come before them how ridiculous it looks. 
[02:10:30]  They just don't know how bad they look.  I think what happens is it looks good at first.  Like you're saying, they do a little and no one can tell, but then they get like obsessed  and they add a little more, a little more, and then they go too far.  Rihanna is her name, I think, by the way.  Oh, very good.  Oh, my God.  You might be right.  I'm pretty sure it's Rihanna.  Oh, my God.  Who's that?  That's someone else.  I mean, there's other things she can get done, like the neck.  Could you find Rihanna?  I think that was her name.  The little kids.  Oh, God.  Who's that one above?  That's weird looking. 
[02:11:00]  Do you like them a little, though, Jim?  Yeah, I've kissed girls that had that, and I wouldn't want to date somebody that had  that, but it does feel soft.  And I'm telling you, those on your cock is a fucking winner.  Little balloons.  Yeah, it feels good, though.  For girls, it's good with their mouth.  That feels really good.  It's a catcher's mitt.  I mean, oh, my God.  Why?  These are like the extremes.  It looks like a fucked up asshole.  Yeah, it does.  It looks like a prolapsed ass on her face.  Or what are those things?  What are those pumps that girls use on their pussy?  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[02:11:30]  They pump their pussy lips up.  The suction.  Can we go with the girl that we're talking about, though?  Rhiannon, yes.  Rhiannon, I think her name is.  She used to explain when she had to go home for holidays, she would take the saline out and make  them almost presentable.  And then when she was doing her shit, she would blow them up.  She pumped them up.  Basketball size.  Horrifying and awesome.  Yes.  It was highly illegal.  She found a doctor that did this and gave her a valve.  That's so crazy.  I met a girl.  I was doing, like, hiking.  Rihanna comes up.  Mistress Rhiannon with an N.  I think you're right, Jimmy.  Good memory. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, mistress.  I think you're right.  She's old school.  She might not be around anymore, man.  This goes back 12 years, probably.  Yeah.  If anyone knows who we're talking about and they can send me a link, that'd be great.  How about R-H-I-A-N-N-O-N?  Rhiannon's dungeon?  Try that.  I like how this started out with...  Yeah, yeah.  This started out...  Jimmy!  What's her name?  This started out with...  Oh, did she have brown hair?  Did she have dark hair?  Jimmy.  Oh, God.  That's her.  That's her.  That's her right there. 
[02:12:30]  I mean, the tattoos are unforgivable.  And look, you can see where the scars under her armpit are from where the valve came out.  That's her.  Annie Letterman.  I like how she's like, I'm going to take my tits down to be presentable, and the rest  of her is just a shit show, too.  I mean, she's your friend.  Excuse me.  No, no.  I like her lips.  It's been a long time.  I mean, Jimmy, that's great.  Come on, Jimmy.  I mean, you're a sexual pervert.  There's no way you like those lips.  She's still around, because that's obviously...  That's a more recent picture.  I remember her being a lot younger.  Yeah, I remember her being a lot younger than that. 
[02:13:00]  I mean...  She is terrible.  Let me see some more.  Well, I do like it.  If you're going to do it, do it.  Do you know what I mean?  Holy fuck.  Go crazy.  How big is that?  Two watermelons?  Easily, right?  Easily.  That's...  Bigger than my head.  You've just, like, fucked yourself up.  Yeah.  Well, she makes money off this, though.  Her mouth is fucking crazy.  This is how she makes her money.  You can make money if you cut your hand off and sew the stumps together, too.  So, E-Rock's sending over the pictures when she was on our show to Sam, so that'll be  good.  Oh, we're going to see... 
[02:13:30]  Is she naked there, Sam?  Totally?  I don't remember her pussy.  Uh-oh.  Oh, yeah.  Don't be...  She's a little shy.  Yeah.  Tee-hee.  Don't look.  Tee-hee.  She's growing her fingernails to the point they're, you know, in circles, so...  Ugh.  They're really long.  Jimmy, did you...  She's trying to get a lot of...  She's trying to get a lot of records here.  World records.  Yeah.  She was cool.  She did some things for us.  I liked her.  She was skeevy.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'm sure she's cool.  I think she beat up guys with her tits and stuff.  Oh, that's fun. 
[02:14:00]  I recommended her for something.  I don't remember what it was, but she didn't show up or contact...  No, it was like some gig.  It was a gig, like...  And she didn't...  Third grade teacher?  No.  Why did I answer literally?  Child's bar mitzvah?  Yeah.  Yes.  That'd be great.  Two yarmulkes on her big tits.  It's wonderful.  She's reciting the Torah.  And she didn't, like, contact the person or something?  Oh, really?  I never talked to her again, yeah.  Maybe something happened.  I feel like with her, there could be a lot of, like, injuries.  Hazardous, yeah.  Iraq, are you still updating the OA photos, Twitter account, whatever it is? 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, we found a new server that'll allow the content that we have.  Oh, that's her doing the saline.  You should follow OA...  Is it called OA Photos?  OA Photos on Twitter.  It's all the old photos from when we really were able to do shit on the radio.  She can't even, like, center her nipples anymore?  No.  What is this guy doing?  Do you remember this?  I know.  I don't remember this.  Pumping up the tits with the saline.  Is that on Jeremy?  It looks like Ron's hair, no?  Wait, they did this...  I thought that saline.  We did this live on our show?  Yeah.  I don't remember that she actually fucking pumped up her tits with saline on our show. 
[02:15:00]  Crazy.  Look at the horrible bag mark.  And look at the word sagging.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  God damn.  Oh, my God.  She's just adding saline right on the air.  You think we would be able to do this here?  Her tit looks like the hiney-headed aliens from the Menagerie episode of Star Trek.  I'm sorry, Anthony.  I still have that jacket.  I recognize my jacket.  Is that your hand?  Yes, that's me.  I'm holding her tits.  Jimmy.  Dude, I still have that fucking jacket.  Look how little your hands look.  Oh, God. 
[02:15:30]  Look at her nails.  This is 12 years ago.  October 2001.  Oh, God.  What's the scar right there?  She just got a procedure before she came in.  I remember that, too.  That is so crazy.  That was to put the bigger bag in so she could fucking put more saline in.  I met a woman.  I was in L.A., and I was going on a hike, and I met this girl who had a really nice body,  so me and my friend were just asking her diet tips, which is a weird thing I like to do.  She was like, I actually live right around her.  You should come up to my apartment, and I'll show you all the stuff I have.  She had fake tits and stuff.  We went up, and she showed us her fridge and all of her food and stuff. 
[02:16:00]  And then she showed us our fake tits, and then she showed us pictures of her pussy.  It was so weird.  And then she also does Botox illegally in her house.  Oh, that's always good.  And she has all this stuff.  She's like, I can do your lips or whatever you want.  She's always texting me with like, I'll come over, and I'll do Botox.  No.  I'm good.  Yeah, I think she wanted you.  She does want to fuck me.  No, she didn't.  She wanted you.  That's so obvious.  She was like, I'm thinking about you.  She only fucks black dudes, and I guess me.  Oh, all right.  What a good egg.  But she was just like, uh... 
[02:16:30]  What a good egg.  I saw Anthony just something die, and Anthony dies when I said that.  Exactly.  Just die.  Yeah, your eyes just went like the Terminator at the end of Tuesday.  Yeah, yeah.  I was like, she showed me her pussy, black eyed.  I just powered down, yeah.  Any other pictures from that day?  Uh-uh.  That's about it, huh?  Dude, I love these old pictures, man.  That's 2000 or 2001.  I said, yeah, 2001.  Yeah, 2001.  Eric, when did it all win?  October 26, 2001.  That's how we fucking...  That is...  Got over 9-11.  We got over 9-11, yeah. 
[02:17:00]  We brought the big-titted monster in.  Oh, God.  That's gotta be someone's 9-11.  It was time to move on.  Yeah, yeah.  We realized it was time.  Yeah.  Terrorists win if I don't grab these giant tits.  I can just imagine seeing two planes just go into those titties.  Yeah.  Yes, exactly.  Oh, my God.  They're crazy.  I like how it's cool for you to see these pictures, because now you get to relive...  I mean, you have a grin on your face you didn't have before you saw your...  Yeah, because that's his head, because he recognizes his jacket.  Yeah, I'm just so happy I can fit in that jacket again.  That's all I thought of when I saw it.  Yeah, the picture we're showing here, you don't see the face of the person, just a hand, 
[02:17:30]  and Jimmy recognizes that.  That's my fucking Buell jacket.  I bought that when I was in Vegas with Dice.  And...  Yeah, when everybody's wearing, like, those garage-type jackets.  Right.  Yeah, I bought that in Vegas.  Mechanics.  I liked those.  I was in middle school.  I looked exactly like the Middle Hanson brother.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  People were, like, stopping me.  Really?  You trashed me for that.  I thought you were fucking the Middle Hanson kid.  What?  You trashed me for that jacket, I think.  I don't know.  I remember saying that you looked like a wigger in some outfit, and you got upset.  I love wiggers, though.  That was me, like, a compliment.  No, I don't wear that jacket I got rid of. 
[02:18:00]  I know what you mean.  I don't use that jacket anymore.  The puffy jacket?  You were into the whole wigger thing?  No.  I love wiggers.  I love them.  I lost my virginity to a guy that is, like, he's in jail now, but, I mean, he's such  like, fucking, yeah, I mean, I love it.  Yeah, let me tell you.  I mean, I don't love it.  They don't have good pictures.  Here, look up.  Go to my Instagram, and you can see the guy I lost my virginity to.  All right.  Why is he in jail?  For what?  Like, burglary stuff.  She was 12 at the time.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, if people went to jail for that, you wouldn't be here.  I keep the legal lady. 
[02:18:30]  Lady.  Jesus.  Oh, that's weird, though, see.  The white trash my family is.  Oh, wow.  Look how ugly my brothers look.  I mean, it's so...  I mean, I look like a boy as well, but, I mean, it's just...  Are you in that picture?  That's my twin brother.  That's me.  That little boy.  Oh, I didn't see you.  You look like the middle handsome.  Which one's your twin brother?  This one and the wife beater.  Wait, you really have a twin?  Yeah. 
[02:19:00]  Well, he looks like...  You know what he looks like?  He looks like Kelly from Bad News Bears.  Kelly Leak.  Yeah.  I think he looks like Doug, the cartoon.  And the other one looks like young Club Soda Kenny.  Yeah.  He has a nose job now, my older brother.  Oh, yeah?  And they don't have acne anymore, thank God.  Aw.  He's, like, way down.  I like how this is just a ploy for you to look at pictures of me.  Yeah, exactly.  I don't care.  It's great.  I mean...  Mmm.  A load more.  This is disappointing, guys.  Is that how Instagram is viewed?  I never looked at anybody's Instagram.  I've never seen it like that.  No, it's not usually like that. 
[02:19:30]  I've never seen it on the computer.  I have the picture of you from Super Bowl.  Yeah, everything's on the phone.  I've never seen Instagram.  Where's the picture from Super Bowl?  Oh, is that him?  Oh, boy, yeah.  Okay.  Oh, Jesus.  I loved him.  Brad Pretanik.  I loved him.  I was, like, 14.  He was 16.  He fucked me on his waterbed.  Nice.  He was so mean to me, and I was just, like, obsessed with him.  Really?  He fucked my friend.  Oh, boy.  I loved him.  You turned me around on this guy.  Yeah.  I like him. 
[02:20:00]  He drove a neon.  Oh, I didn't know you should like him.  He's great.  He's in fucking jail.  It's amazing.  What did he do?  It was a burglar and shit.  Oh, oh.  But, I mean, I don't know.  We were all bad kids.  I went to a school for juvenile delinquents.  Oh.  So we all did bad shit.  But it's just disgusting.  Where's the picture of us at the Super Bowl?  I want to see myself then and now.  That's all I care about right now.  I mean, you look like shit in it, too, so it's perfect.  From Ant's House.  Right there.  Right.  Sleeping with a double chin.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jimmy. 
[02:20:30]  God, look at that.  I mean, you look like an elderly woman.  I really look terrible in that picture.  You look like Anthony's racist, huh?  I'm getting out of the tub of the shining.  I mean, that was an interesting place to be in.  I was like, it felt like a museum how legitimately racist everyone was.  It's great, right?  I was like, this can't be real.  Do people really feel this way?  I was just like.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That's wonderful.  That's my family.  They're wonderful.  I love them.  Wonderfully racist.  It was fun.  Yeah, right?  You're fucking 3D.  I was thinking that. 
[02:21:00]  I saw a 3D movie.  I saw Star Trek in 3D.  Yeah.  And I was like, you fucking probably have it at your house in 3D already.  Oh, man.  Not yet, but.  I mean.  That's so crazy.  I'll watch that one in 3D.  I don't think I like 3D.  I mean, it's cool that it exists, but it's a little much.  Gravity.  We got to see Gravity.  That's what I want to see.  Oh, yeah.  That when we watched the trailer for the fucking.  Oh, God.  That looks good.  The certain movies are good in 3D.  Others, it's like, why are you bothering putting this in 3D?  From when I had Crabs.  Oh, yeah, Crabs.  In college.  Yeah.  Who'd you get them from? 
[02:21:30]  Oh, yeah.  I used RID.  I got them from.  Did you just have it on there?  Three times I've had it.  Toilet seat.  Crabs is so funny because it's literally the best.  I mean, it goes away.  It's hilarious.  They're alive, which is weird.  It's like, it's just so funny.  I got them in college from this guy.  There was a.  I lived in Santa Fe, and they filmed a lot of movies there.  Yeah.  I mean, can you get your judgment off your fucking face for a second?  No.  I'm like fucking grossed out.  How dare you?  I'm not judging.  You never got it?  No, I swear to God.  I feel bad for you, then.  I swear to God.  You haven't lived enough.  You never got Crabs.  No, it was. 
[02:22:00]  But how does a guy pass that on if he knows he has it?  He denied it, which is crazy.  But you know where you got it from.  But he was on the crew of this movie.  Yeah.  I mean, he was the one I was fucking.  So he was on the crew.  I did dry hump a couple other people.  I don't know where I was on.  It was lace.  Maybe I could have gotten it.  But he went back to L.A., and it was like, right.  And then I figured out I had it, and he denied it.  He was weird.  Did you meet him on the set there, or did you?  Yeah, I did.  I met him.  Yeah, I met him on.  I was, at that time, a go-go dancer, which is so weird.  Whoa.  You're wild. 
[02:22:30]  I can't dance.  It's embarrassing that I was.  It was in a blackout.  I was talking to him about it yesterday.  I would, like, cry and fall off the podium.  It was, like, really amazing.  I would still pay to see that.  It was at a gay club.  It was, like, me, a tranny, and a stripper.  Wow.  And I couldn't, like, people would try to touch.  I would just freak out.  I, like, couldn't deal with it.  Just weeping.  Literally would fall off.  I'd hurt my knees.  So I would just always, it was a shit show, and I had crabs while I was dancing, which was  a nightmare.  Oh, my God.  Kept me moving. 
[02:23:00]  Wow, you've had a life already, man.  Yeah.  Got a lot of good stories.  Isn't it odd that you could tell a guy, like, well, I got crabs, and the guy would just  still be like, yeah, fuck it.  It's okay.  Yeah, get rid of him.  No, it's like nothing.  I fucked a girl knowing she had crabs.  You know what?  See?  I got them from the same girl twice.  A black chick.  I did.  Give me crabs once?  Yeah.  Shame on you.  Give me crabs twice?  I just have fucking black chicks.  Yeah, exactly.  I just went over with cocktail sauce in my pubes.  She was fucking, uh, she was a black girl who lived about a mile from me, and I had 
[02:23:30]  wanted to fuck her for a while, because she used to bang a friend of mine, and her pussy  smelled so bad.  And I was standing on my steps, this is when I lived in North Brunswick.  I like how you're like, her pussy smelled so bad, I came back again, and I got crabs  for like two minutes.  Yeah, I was very not at all picky.  She was standing three steps below me outside, I could smell her pussy through her jeans.  Oh, wow.  It was a fucking outside.  It was a bacterial vaginosis situation.  Yeah, that's the real problem.  Oh, yeah.  Twice. 
[02:24:00]  It was not a good scene.  The first time she gave me crabs, so I went and got rid medication, and they have, I had,  fuck, I have awful straight pubes, like a Chinese fucking hairdo.  They're so disgusting.  Any chance of me fucking you just died.  Damn.  I don't keep them anymore.  I've had enough pubes in years.  I mean, I can't.  He's clean now.  That's worse.  I mean, a bald, I don't know if it's worse than bald.  He's bald.  It's totally bald.  Like a chemo patient?  Yeah, he's completely bald.  Hair that used to be there, that's no longer there?  Wispy straight hair.  I had to take the fucking, I had to take the crab, the comb, and you fucking cut, you shave 
[02:24:30]  through them.  I think I shaved my pubes.  You can't shave them.  It's bad.  They burrow.  I learned that.  No, no, no.  But back then, I might have after.  No.  I mean, I can't.  I regret the shame that I feel with your fucking face.  How fucking dare you?  How dare you?  I'm learning a lot.  It's all good.  I don't even have HPV.  There's shocking things about my life.  That's number one.  How did you know you?  I'll tell you how I knew I had, but I felt an itch on my ball, and I picked it, and I  felt like I just pulled it, and I'll never forget the little black and the legs moving. 
[02:25:00]  The legs moving.  I'm about to slide off my seat here.  Oh, God.  So hot.  That's not how you slats crabs carrying your foot.  And then, how many did you see after that?  I only saw a few because I had just gotten them.  I think it was a brand new infestation.  Yeah, the eggs, they hatch.  Oh.  I didn't get that far.  Oh, the eggs.  But I pulled a few out with that comb, and then you wash with your clothes.  Those are the medication.  And then I kind of knew that this girl gave them to me.  Oh, God.  But I was so horny.  A week later, I think I went back and fucked her again just to make sure. 
[02:25:30]  He was sitting in his bed.  He could smell her pussy from four blocks away.  Yeah, yeah.  It was a follow-up.  So I went back, and then I pulled one.  It was in my skin out, and I saw the legs again.  But I already had the RID, and it was like the next day.  So I got rid of them immediately, and I told her, and she denied it.  What was so good about her?  I didn't really deny it.  Yeah, but what was so good about her that her pussy smelled horrendous, and she had crabs,  and he did it twice?  She let me.  What was the good stuff?  Oh.  That was it.  Oh, it was those days.  Sometimes, but you have to go back sometimes. 
[02:26:00]  I think when, like, I've had that happen, where you have, like, some sort of, like, horrific  experience with someone, and it's almost like I can't, like, trust myself.  I hooked up with a guy who had, like, a micropenis.  Like, I couldn't believe it.  Oh, my God.  Really?  Real small, though.  Come on.  I mean, like, two number two pencil erasers fused together.  Oh, my God.  No way.  Like, unbelievable.  No.  Seriously.  Like, it was crazy, and I couldn't, and it was when I was drinking, so I, like, fucked him.  I was chubby.  And I fucked him, and I, like, couldn't.  Did you feel anything?  No, you couldn't. 
[02:26:30]  I couldn't feel it, and it just felt, like, kind of wet.  It was, like, really gross.  That's hilarious.  And then, but I couldn't believe it, so, like, months later, I was, like, I gotta go back.  Like, I can't have imagined.  This can't be real.  Right.  And it was really, and I can't believe that I fucked him twice.  Did you suck it?  No, I tried.  It was, like, you couldn't.  No.  No hand could, like, be involved.  Oh, my God.  You couldn't do mouth and hand.  What was the first thing you thought when you first saw it and were, like, oh, no.  I mean, I was, like, who cares? 
[02:27:00]  I'm an alcoholic, fat piece of shit.  He also, he had been a freshman, he had been a freshman when I was a senior for the first  of seven years, and he, so he kind of, like, looked up to me.  I know he had had a crush on me or whatever, and he, and he had been mean to me, like, his  freshman year, and I was, like, this fucking freshman is mean to me.  I'm gonna fuck this motherfucker.  Oh.  The minute he was mean to me, I'm, like, you're gonna get it.  Oh, man.  He, I remember him, when he was fucking me, he was going, I can't believe I'm fucking  Annie Letterman.  And I was, like, neither can I, but. 
[02:27:30]  Jesus.  Wow.  And my friend called, I think he was, like, going down on me, and my friend called me  about her abortion.  It was, like, just a real shit show.  I was just talking her throat.  Like, it's fine.  Was it a turn on at all?  That you were with him?  I mean, it was cool that he, like, was so excited to fuck me.  That was kind of fun.  And that's always hot for, like, a second, and then the minute that I realized that they're  powerless losers, I can't handle it.  Isn't that odd that he can't just say, look, before we do this, there's something I gotta  tell you. 
[02:28:00]  How do you not tell somebody?  It was really shocking, and it was, but I didn't tell anyone.  Like, I, it's, like, it was so bad that I, like, didn't want to, like, spread the rumor.  Right.  Because I was, like, I felt bad for him, because it's, like, there's something wrong with him.  But I did realize he did get in these, like, long-term relationships, so he'd find these  girls that, like, didn't care.  Because he was a good-looking guy, and he was, like, he was, like, mean in the right  way, and...  Did he have, uh, normal-sized, uh, balls?  I can't remember.  Oh.  A micro-penis.  I think he did.  You don't want a micro-penis.  Dude, you're cursed.  And I can't, I...  Having a small penis is bad enough. 
[02:28:30]  Imagine having a micro-penis.  Imagine a medical name for your cock that's negative.  Micro.  Micro.  I mean, get a surgery or something, or become a woman.  There's gotta be something you could do, I would assume, though.  Oh, my God.  I don't think there's anything you could do.  There's gotta be, I mean, there's no female Jim Nortons that are looking for a tiny dick.  No.  Let's see how small it was.  We got a bunch of pictures here for...  Oh, a micro-penis.  Annie Letterman.  It was, like...  The one on the top right?  I might even give him...  You might give him that.  I might give him that one.  Which one?  But that's too big. 
[02:29:00]  That was bigger than that.  He didn't have, like, a fupa.  Oh, look at the one below that.  I like how there's just a baby with a dick on its mouth, too.  Yeah.  That's gotta be a fake...  That's hair lip shit.  What is that?  They threw a hair lip picture in there.  I guess it's...  Why would they do that?  I mean, that's a kid.  Oh, God.  I can't tell.  All right.  We should take a break, though.  We got Annie Letterman in studio.  Mick Foley's standing by.  We're gonna have him join the program.  And then Jeffrey Tambor.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  Still lots of radio to do.  Stop studded. 
[02:29:30]  Annie Letterman's gonna be...  You're warming up for Jim Norton, right?  At Stress Factory?  We're working together at Stress Factory.  Working together at Stress Factory.  Very fucking cool.  I'm his warm-up girl.  I throw T-shirts into the crowd.  Working together.  Yeah.  Much better way to say that.  No, I liked it.  Annie Letterman there.  Made me feel like I had a job.  The O.P. and Anthony Channel.  Channel.  Channel.  Channel.  Channel.  On SiriusXM.  I sure hope it's this.  Are you gonna repurpose a repurpose bit?  Or us discussing repurpose.  Discussing repurpose. 
[02:30:00]  That would be some weird Matrix shit.  I'm purposed.  Repurposed.  Nice.  Nice.  Purposed.  Repurposed.  Nice.  What does that mean?  A new purpose?  But a repurposed means you're purposing it again.  A repurpose has a new purpose to what?  Originally had a different purpose.  Purposed.  Purposed.  Repurposed.  Nice.  Purposed.  Repurposed.  Nice.  Weird Matrix shit.  A new purpose.  Weird Matrix shit. 
[02:30:30]  A new purpose.  Weird Matrix shit.  A new purpose.  Wait.  Alright, let's break it down.  Re-use.  So, you use something, and then you reuse it.  So, it's not a new purpose.  You're using it for the same shit.  Purpose is sounding weird now.  Purposed.  Purposed.  Repurposed.  Nice.  Purposed.  Repurposed.  Nice.  Weird Matrix shit.  A new purpose.  Weird Matrix shit. 
[02:31:00]  A new purpose.  Weird Matrix shit.  We're taking an audio that at one point had a purpose, and adding a new purpose to the  same audio.  Now, we're repurposing that same audio as to be a song.  Well, there you go.  There's the repurpose.  Repurpose.  Repurpose.  Repurpose.  Repurpose.  Repurpose.  The O.P.L.T. Show continues.  Let's do this. 
[02:31:30]  We got Mick Foley walking down the hall.  Andy Letterman killing it today for us, who's working with Jimmy at the Stress Factory this  weekend.  Yeah.  Andy's very funny.  Very honest comic, which I love.  I'm depressed watching Mick Foley walk down the hall. 
[02:32:00]  Why?  Is he limping?  Yeah, he's hurting.  He fucking gave up.  He gave the world his body.  Nice.  I wonder if he has...  So did I.  I gave my college my body.  My high school.  Nice.  The local gym.  Mick.  Wow, he's moving slower, dude.  What's up?  I wonder if he has arthritis.  I wonder if it's arthritis.  I mean, did you guys talk shit on me while I was walking in?  Well, sort of.  Yeah.  Sorry.  It wasn't that bad, though.  Did you say I was a cunt?  No.  No.  I figured that would just... 
[02:32:30]  Like, her dad hates her and she deserves it.  Mick Foley in studio.  You're over here.  You're in Anthony's seat.  And went home early.  You're in Anthony's seat.  And then we're going to put Jeffrey Tambor over there, who I hear you're a big fan of.  I am.  From Arrested Development and whatnot.  You got Santa Claus shirts?  I'm for you guys, yeah.  What's up with the leg?  You all right?  Oh, my God.  You're starting to hurt a little bit, huh?  This is a bad day.  Is it arthritis?  You know what? 
[02:33:00]  It's a combination of so many things I should not have done to myself.  That's what I was telling Annie Letterman.  You fucking sacrificed your body for everyone's entertainment.  If I had known.  Well, this was just a...  What would you do?  It was just a wrestling...  Yeah, but what would you do if you had known?  Did you have an altar?  Same thing.  Yeah.  No, I would have...  He did some crazy shit, man.  For real.  I would have...  Crazy.  Well, I say I would have not done some of the things I did in front of the  smaller crowds, but then that's kind of what...  Save it for the big fucking pay-per-views, right, Mick? 
[02:33:30]  But you can't think that way when that's all...  You know, you leave it all out there on the stage.  Because you might not get to the fucking WrestleMania if you don't make the  smaller crowds happy, too.  That's where you got a little arthritis happening here and there.  Man.  Are we on the air?  Yeah.  We are?  Oh, yeah.  I thought you knew that.  We're on the air.  I don't mean to sound to a forlorn.  No.  That's the same for a time.  All right.  I'm ready to broadcast anyway.  Yeah, no, it was a bad back day for me.  There's a lot of...  Annie, there's a lot of different issues. 
[02:34:00]  That's right.  You caught me on the air saying I shouldn't have done some of the things.  No, that's smart.  I mean...  But you're just showing what kind of guy you are by saying that.  That maybe you probably shouldn't have fucking...  Probably shouldn't have, but...  For Schenectady or fucking...  I'm talking about the Southwest when there was a few hundred people on hand and I  would think to myself, hey, you know, there might be two to three people who drove  three hundred miles and they want to see some, you know, some Cactus Jack stuff.  So, of course you should say that on the air.  People should know that you never fucking called it in. 
[02:34:30]  But here's the irony, and even though we hate these, we're an irony, is that then when  you get to where there's 15,000 people a night, then you look at it and you're like,  wow, I better save something for tomorrow, you know?  So, in that way, you're not given as much of yourself on the big stage as you were every  night.  And that's what...  Not that I mean to clumsily segue into the shows that I'm doing, including...  Caroline's?  That's the big one for me.  And if any of you guys could make it there, I'd be deeply indebted. 
[02:35:00]  What day is Caroline's?  It's Sunday night, June 1st.  All right.  We're a week away.  A week from Sunday.  And the big deal for me is that...  Because whenever I come on, you guys are like, oh, what do you do?  Tell me about the show.  And I've got the old Mr. Miyagi clip, and I'm glad to say that the best thing that ever  happened to me was I went to Montreal, and I saw a gym in Montreal.  Yep.  And that's when I finally got the message that, oh, okay, if people want to hear someone  talk about something other than wrestling, there's like 3,000 other places to go. 
[02:35:30]  And if you want to, you know, do something in this business, then you better stick to what  it is that people like about you, and find a way then to make the stories interesting  for yourself.  So once I got that message, it was like, man, just the comfort level took off, and I accepted  who I was.  And so June 1st, WWE's coming to Caroline's to film the show, not for broadcast, but so  that the big guys can look at it.  And my hope and my feeling is that once they see what I do, they're going to like it. 
[02:36:00]  But what could they do with it?  Well, I think right now they see it as a wild departure.  I know that when a couple of the WWE guys came to one of my shows a while back, they  were like, don't be doing that Mr. Miyagi skit with them.  Like, they think that's what I do, is talk about loads.  That's what I do.  That's only partially what I do.  That's what Annie does.  I talk about taking them.  By the way, my favorite part right now is Annie can't figure out how to get her chair  down.  I'm so on the conch over.  I'm straddling the fucking thing. 
[02:36:30]  I'm just gyrating.  You know Annie?  She's a very funny stand-up as well there.  I don't know her, but I'm going to get to her by way of a Santa Claus t-shirt.  She's going places.  She's going places.  This is a St. Mick t-shirt.  And when Jeffrey's interview is done, I'll tell you about the documentary I'm doing.  And here you go.  She's...  Thank you.  I have a medium as well, if that would fit you.  Just so...  Why is this a small and you think I'm a medium and a piece of garbage?  Have you seen my tits?  I'm like a child's extra small. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, you really just...  You really know how to charm them, Mick.  I was just throwing over...  I can't double X, you fat pig.  You want this?  I mean, am I the dumbest human?  What do you got left there, Mick?  I have a medium and I have an XL.  What do you guys want?  I'll take a medium, Mick, obviously.  Why don't you and Annie exchange mediums and larges?  Yeah, let's exchange stuff.  You have a large?  Yeah.  No, I need a medium.  All right, there you go.  Jimmy's at a medium, Mick.  I'm working my way down to a medium again, finally.  Let me see what we have here for Opie. 
[02:37:30]  It's a large.  I can handle a large.  A little night shirt.  Not happy that I can handle a large, but we're working on it.  Will you wear the Sim?  Annie, just so you know, he's obsessed with Christmas, obviously.  And he has a Christmas room in his...  Do you still have the Christmas room, right?  Oh, you better believe I have the Christmas room.  And the kids...  That's really crazy.  The kids still into the Christmas room or they're like,  Dad, it's time to move on.  They love it.  They love it, but they're part of this...  What's in the Christmas room?  It is a collection of artwork, Santa-themed artwork 
[02:38:00]  from some of our great Santa artists.  Do you have a Christmas tree constantly in there?  Of course we do.  Yeah, we have a Christmas tree.  Does it get dusty during the year?  Thank you.  I haven't thought about that yet.  I'm sure it could probably use a little cleaning.  Do you move the ornaments around at least?  Yeah.  Because most people hate their Christmas tree by January 1st.  I mean, it's...  How do you do it all year long?  You just keep a little bit of that Christmas spirit alive.  I mean, Christmas is depressing for me.  Why? 
[02:38:30]  It's depressing for most people.  I mean, I just had a shitty childhood.  I mean, it's like good now.  Like, my family's good now, but it was like not good.  What was the number one thing about your childhood?  I just...  I was like slightly autistic.  I hated being touched.  I hated being...  It was like everything hurt.  You hope that that was autism.  No kidding!  I'm not just being fucking depressed.  I mean, look at that.  I had a tickling uncle, too.  I mean, I think we all did.  I just thought that was a given.  You might just have a bad memory.  But, Annie, in the same way that I probably wouldn't change anything, even though it's 
[02:39:00]  come back to haunt me, right?  These little problems you had made you who you are on stage, right?  Being tickled made me who I am, yeah.  My dad also...  My dad takes full credit, because my dad used to call...  He was like a little bit verbally abusive, so he would call me a cunt and stuff.  Whoa!  He loves it.  He dropped the C word on you?  Yeah, we came up with a good joke the other day.  I was with him, and it was like...  No!  You say...  I'm like, Dad, you say tomato...  Or, I'm like, I say tomato, and you say you're a selfish cunt.  That was like our little father-daughter joke we had the other day.  Isn't that nice, Mick?  He loves it. 
[02:39:30]  Nah, you can't do that in this country.  See, the point is, she doesn't need a Christmas room.  With that relationship, who needs a Christmas room?  I mean, my dad's awesome.  Right.  You know, he told me the truth, you know?  There you go.  About my personality, and now I know, and...  And you open for gym quite often?  We work together.  Not enough.  Not enough.  I've been working this weekend.  Stress factory.  Hey, Mick, did you discover the snowing Christmas tree?  That's what I bought this year.  What did you get?  A snowing Christmas tree.  What's wrong with you?  You got a Christmas room, and you don't have a snowing Christmas tree yet? 
[02:40:00]  Tell me what's going on.  It fucking snows.  All right.  I need that information.  I need to know where I can get one.  It shoots up?  It shoots up like a fucking sprinkler, but it's fake snow, and it comes down on your Christmas tree.  Gotta cause cancer.  I'll do it.  You know what?  There's no way you're not going to have a little tumor for that one.  Yeah, man.  Snowing Christmas tree next year.  Matter of fact, I hated it.  You could have it.  I would just give it to you for free, man.  Now that you heard about the cancer.  You would love it.  No.  Here you go, Mick.  If you bring it to Caroline's, June 1st, I'll have it on the stage. 
[02:40:30]  Really?  I've invited Santa.  Just before we stop talking about all the Santa stuff, I do have a documentary, and the Kickstarter  comes in for all the post-production costs on June 3rd.  It's IamSantaClauseMovie.com for all those cool prizes.  Well, we still have a minute or two before Jeffrey Tambor.  I can't wait, man.  What's the movie about?  What's the gist?  You know what?  What's your little fucking angle on this?  You remember Beyond the Mat, right?  Of course.  All right, it's Beyond the Mat with Santa Clauses, and instead of being the grizzled veteran 
[02:41:00]  in Beyond the Mat, I'm the rookie Santa who learns the joy of becoming.  I mean, wait, I just feel.  You've lost your mind, Mick.  You've lost your mind, Mick.  Is that Santa?  I haven't, no.  But do you have a character that's Santa?  There it is.  Is that what's going on?  Yeah, put up Google Mick Foley Santa, and you'll see.  Here's the sign of the Christmas tree.  Wait, there's the sign of Christmas tree, okay?  I need that tree.  What is it?  That's why I'm bringing it up.  I need that tree.  That's why I'm bringing it up.  There's the snowing Christmas tree, Mick. 
[02:41:30]  It just looks like it's jizzing.  Yeah.  A little bit.  I wish you hadn't put it that way.  All right, but the next model's going to be better.  I need that tree, Opie.  I have it, and I hate it, so I will give it to you.  It's awful.  It's slightly used.  I only used it one season, and I will never put it in my house again.  I love it.  Oh, look, and then it all collects.  You have to have a tongue.  It's got a little receptacle there.  This is the worst thing I've ever seen.  You have to have a close-up on it.  Oh, beauty's in the eye of the beholder, Annie.  I was trying to make it look a little sexy with my angles when I shot it. 
[02:42:00]  Google Mick Foley and Santa Claus and then show the gang here what comes up.  Why would we do that?  It's beautiful.  Watch this.  You will not be disappointed.  But not that one.  Go a little further down to where we actually have the beard and everything.  Which one?  There's something about a guy who wants little kids' buttholes on their knee that makes me  concerned.  And I'm not saying you.  Right.  I don't think...  But the majority...  That was me being run over on Raw.  That was a good moment. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, that's cool.  Yeah, as Santa.  That's why he's limping down the hole now.  Thanks a lot, Vince.  He did it in the Southwest.  Vince should give you a little fucking money.  I don't know why we can't fight.  The toughest thing about that...  They should mail you a check every once in a while.  Look, I'd become Santa and...  Oh, yeah.  The one...  Me and my daughter.  Right there.  Bang.  Put that up.  That's her daughter?  That's my daughter, Noelle.  She's so pretty.  You've got a very pretty daughter.  How old is she now?  She's...  It's better when I say it.  I don't know.  Sounds kind of creepy.  Should have liked to take that one. 
[02:43:00]  She doesn't have a tickling uncle either.  Noelle is 19 years old.  I ask that because when we first started hanging out with you, she was four or five, man.  She was the child that was crying and beyond the map.  You can't back out of this one.  No, no.  Look, what I love about this photo is not only do I...  I make a good Santa there, don't I, Amy?  You look great.  It's shocking that that's you.  That really is me.  Real white beard and everything.  But my daughter, you can see, there's no resentment.  There's no like, oh, my dad is completely ridiculous. 
[02:43:30]  She's light in her eyes.  She's digging me, yeah.  I wonder what that's like.  She's got light in her eyes.  Is that a foreign?  You dress up like a good Santa, though, Mick.  I took a lot of pride in it.  And then I showed up at Raw, and they asked me if I could be run over by Alberto Dario.  I know.  Once again, Vince has to fucking beat your body up.  Thanks, Vince.  Can I just be Santa Claus and be a nice fucking hot thing?  Do you only draw wrestling fans when you do stand-up?  You know what?  I wish that was not the case.  This is where I'm at. 
[02:44:00]  I'm about 95, five wrestling fans.  But those other 5% are usually like the really dedicated women, girlfriends, wives.  Of the guys, yeah.  They'll go out of their way to tell me that they had no idea what to expect, and they really, really enjoyed it.  That's what you should, but that's what you want when you, in this business, you want to draw people who are there to hear what you, you don't want to talk about just anything.  It's like, that's your areas.  Yeah.  You have a tremendous real experience.  Well, once I saw that that was what people wanted, like I said, when I went to Montreal and really got the bigger picture, the show has picked up dramatically. 
[02:44:30]  Attendance has been much better.  Now that people know that they're going to hear stories that interest them.  And then I make it fun for the non-fans as well.  I can't imagine being likable and having people want to see it.  That must be so nice.  People are like, ugh.  Mick, you should do the Santa thing at a mall this year.  I mean.  Why not?  Wait, wait, why is that bad? 
[02:45:00]  There's nothing wrong with that.  He's not a mall Santa.  He would make a great mall Santa.  That was me at Santa's Village.  I mean, it's really incredible.  Why is Sam laughing at that?  When you would love to be a mall Santa, that's the ultimate place to be Santa Claus.  Well, the mall Santa, you know, has, imagine Vince McMahon is your mall Santa boss and you have to answer to him.  Right.  I'm a freelancer.  So once I saw, honestly, what happened is once I had that picture, I texted Stephanie McMahon.  I was in the White Mountains in New Hampshire.  And I was like, really be ashamed to only do this once. 
[02:45:30]  And I thought, she's got three children.  Like, she'll get it.  So I just said, hey, if I send you a photo, will you take a look at it?  She went, sure.  And I sent that photo.  And I said, ho, ho, ho, from St. Mick.  And she was like, that's you?  I was like, yeah, can I be Santa on tribute to the troops?  And next thing I know, I'm up there waving.  And it was great because people had known me for 15 years, like a big show, where I'm like going, who's that guy?  He looks familiar.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was nice.  I wasn't even telling anyone at first.  I wanted to be, I wish I hadn't shown up with the bleach blonde beard because I wanted to be the guy that all the other wrestlers couldn't stand, 
[02:46:00]  where I'd walk up to Damien Sandow and say, like, you don't look like a wrestler.  Maybe you need to take some steroids.  And just get the word coming around, like, Santa's a dick, man.  I like that you dyed it blonde.  You're like hot Santa.  Well, you have to dye it as blonde as, that's not the way I saw it.  We don't think of Santa as hot in our household.  I mean, this is why, this is a question, I've told you my history.  I know.  And I'm not sure. 
[02:46:30]  You should be flattered.  She thinks you're making a hot Santa.  Yeah, again, I'm slipping off my seat.  What you do, Annie, is you get it as blonde as you possibly can, and then you use a little lightener.  But if you try to lighten a dark beard, it just comes across like a mountain of sludge.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You get, like, orange?  No, you just get, um...  Firemouth?  You get, not firemouth, you get it gray, like a molten...  Wait, is that a picture?  Is that your real beard dyed or no?  That's my real beard dyed, yeah.  I think that's why it looks so good.  Oh, I thought that was a fucking thing. 
[02:47:00]  Did it come out?  But then, so then you had that beard, you shaved it or what?  Well, here's the deal.  I was in this situation where I was doing a children's book.  Jesus, you could grow some facial hair, huh?  I was doing a children's book.  Fuck.  I had a children's book out, and I didn't want to confuse kids.  So before I went and did my book signings, I would spray my white bleach beard dark.  And so there's a segment of me on the Today Show where I just looked like the Wolfman.  I just looked hideous.  And you know what?  Well, here's where, you know, subtlety really works in most cases.  And I'm there on the Today Show, and they show a clip of Tribute to the Troops, and instead 
[02:47:30]  of going, hey, that guy looks vaguely familiar, the guy goes, that looks a lot like you, Mick.  And so I tried covering it.  Like, come on, keep some imagination alive.  Like, if you know, you know.  But I did look like the Wolfman, so I was spraying my bleached beard dark so as not to  confuse the children.  You are such a good person.  Yeah, he really is.  It makes me uncomfortable.  It makes me feel good.  Are you attracted to bad men?  I mean, whoa.  We really took this to another level. 
[02:48:00]  Of course.  It's a touching question.  Of course.  I love to be choked.  Is that what you asked?  No.  You ever choke abroad, Mick?  Never.  No.  That's not something I...  They like it.  Try it.  Not something they encouraged at Ward-Belville?  No.  I mean, it's...  Well, look, there's something for everyone out there that's...  I've got some...  You know, I've got some...  Some what, Mick?  Some kinks.  You got a little freaky side to you, Mick?  Tell us.  Come on.  When I went to Australia, I was kind of searching for a former girlfriend, and there's no way 
[02:48:30]  anyone could find out unless you, say, tweet about it, you know, in which case I call home  from Australia.  And my nine-year-old goes, Dad, Mom's really angry with you.  I said, how come?  He says, she knows you're looking for your ex-girlfriend.  And I said, listen, buddy, you have to understand, that was 25 years ago, and that woman would  probably be 68 or 69 years old by now.  And I can hear him head off, and he gets back on the phone, and he goes, Mom says that's  just the way you like them. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, you like a little old, Mick?  You went old?  I like old.  I like that.  You went old when you were younger?  I know.  I love this.  My wife is 52, and to me, she gets hot every year.  I'll be 48 next week.  Oh, you like...  Two weeks.  Two weeks.  But I do like a little seasoning.  I mean, this is great.  This is so good for me to be at the...  I can't believe you're all freaks.  I love it.  So when I'm hanging around the WWE Divas, even though I acknowledge they're beautiful, it's  much more like a big brother feel.  Would you have sex...  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  Would you have sex with Helen Mirren? 
[02:49:30]  Yes.  Yeah, I will admit that...  There's something sexy about her.  Yeah.  It's funny that you're sitting in the same seat as Anthony, who has the exact opposite.  The opposite, yeah.  There's some...  I'm 15 years too old for Anthony.  Listen, can I make a shocking...  Oh, sure.  All right.  Life on the road can be lonely and tough, and I'm in a great degree of pain.  Yeah.  And I will admit that I touched myself during the episode of Saturday Night Live that Helen 
[02:50:00]  Mirren hosted.  To completion.  Why don't you...  Me too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've jerked off to one of her movies too.  Yes, for Caligula.  Yeah, but she was young back then.  Yeah, I didn't care.  But she was topless.  You're kidding me.  In Caligula.  You want to see the picture?  Picture?  Picker?  You want to see the picture?  You know, can we get...  The picture?  Confirmation from Miss Mirren's people that she wouldn't mind that.  Because part of...  One of my stories...  I think she wouldn't mind.  No.  She's got to know it's happening. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, she'd be all right with that.  She's better tits than me.  She has great tits, right?  She's got big and heavies there, Mick.  You know...  Let's get the picture up for you.  Again, beauty is the eye of the beholder.  And I love breasts of all shapes and sizes.  Thank you so much.  Mine are a little young.  Wait, who's your porn star again?  I had a...  The one you really like.  Yeah, yeah, right.  Christy Canyon.  Christy Canyon.  Kate Parker.  But you remember I had a...  Ooh, Kate Parker.  Very, very nice.  British.  The mother in Taboo and Taboo 2.  There you go, yeah.  You guys, this is horrifying. 
[02:51:00]  Wait, that's Helen Mirren?  Oh, that's...  That's now, though.  She looks...  But they look great, so...  She still looks great, yeah.  Oh, my goodness.  My God.  All right, that's a little rough.  I don't know.  I'm not...  She looks like Roger Daltrey.  I'm done.  I'm done with my Helen Mirren fetish.  That's a bad thing there, Tim.  Mick, you're alone on this one.  I used to think, yeah, all right, no way.  What movie is that from?  I don't know.  She was getting naked just a few years ago.  I mean, she looks good.  For an older woman, she's probably 70 years old.  60, 67, 68?  Yes.  She looks like my dad a little bit. 
[02:51:30]  Definitely.  In a heartbeat.  Which I'm into.  If I had approval from my wife, that is.  Oh, she was...  I've only been married, Mick.  Yeah.  23 years.  All right.  Yeah, I don't...  As far as I know, I don't have a free pass, but I'm going to ask if Helen Mirren could  be put on that short.  She was sexy and Caligula.  I wonder if Helen Mirren gets hit on a lot by younger guys, and they think they're doing  her this favor, and she's like, get the fuck away from me, Helen Mirren.  Like, no.  Look at this picture of her from Caligula.  You can see the fucking see-through. 
[02:52:00]  Can you see that on my phone?  Oh, my God.  Look at that see-through fucking white she was wearing.  That's 1980.  It would be so cool to be that old and have guys want to fuck you.  That must be the worst part about getting old.  I'm getting used to it.  I'm getting ready for it.  I mean...  Don't men want to make love to you?  Ugh, what?  Not one that I let near me.  Are you kidding me?  Get the fuck away from me.  She's quick.  I love it.  Can I brag about one thing?  Wait, can I see this?  Can I show off on one thing about my show?  You know, we've talked about the cursing issue before, right? 
[02:52:30]  I've got it down to where I only swear I drop one F-bomb, but it gets a standing ovation.  Are you trying to hurt my feelings?  No, I'm just saying different people work different...  I've got it down to one word that's not the F-word.  All right, you want me to tell you why this is?  Boy, I didn't see that coming.  I'm going to drop an F-bomb for you guys, okay?  Setting up his own bit.  I very rarely do this, but it was that lady in Australia, the first time that our bodies 
[02:53:00]  became one, she just looked up at me and looked me right in the eyes, and she said,  Fuck.  And I was hooked.  Why are you gazing into my eyes while you're telling this?  For unknown reasons?  Too intimate.  And then she later said she just kind of wanted to dangle it out there.  She didn't want to overdo it.  She wanted to see how I reacted.  And I was hooked.  I was like a guy with his first taste of some type of...  See, if she wanted that reaction out of me, she would have to say, like, I wish your cock 
[02:53:30]  was black, and then I would just come on her leg like a dog.  It is fun being friends with you, Jimmy, because I know, like, if I, like, do something...  If I have a threesome or I fuck a guy with a giant dick, I'm like, Jimmy's going to be  so proud.  Like, I can't wait to tell him.  I'll be very happy for you.  Mick, you have a micropenis?  It's an Irish penis.  You got an Irish penis.  You got an Irish penis. 
[02:54:00]  Redheaded?  Redwood?  That's a callback, because Annie told a nice story about fucking a guy with a micropenis.  Yeah?  By the way, I got a text from a woman I know.  She went twice.  A woman I know, I'll just say she's from Atlantic City, and she's a cop.  And she texted me, I was so rude to the guy in the micropenis store.  She had a guy like that.  She said, when I touched it with my hand, I actually looked at him and asked, what is  this?  And I said, really?  And she goes, yeah, I was drunk and put my hand on his pants. 
[02:54:30]  He had been trying to sleep with me for a while.  So I was literally surprised, like, really?  This is what you brought?  And it didn't end well.  And I told him I had to go to the bathroom, and I snuck downstairs and left.  Oh, my God.  Here's the thing that spoke to him.  How great is that?  Good for you.  I love that he was aggressively pursuing a cop.  She handles guns.  She's not going to want your little dick.  But it might have been before she was a cop.  Why would I have to give a literal answer to that?  She's kidding.  Did it say anywhere in the story that this was a male, a female cop?  What's that?  Does it say that it was a female cop?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, a female cop.  Excuse me, you want to tell that other little story that you told us during the break? 
[02:55:00]  I'm not ready to yet.  You sure?  I want to, yeah, but I just can't.  Wow.  Is this what it's like?  You just egg him on like this?  No, I have to, though, sometimes.  Yeah.  A couple of stories I won't tell.  That one...  He's got a great story.  He'll tell eventually.  Eventually.  That's the beauty of the show.  Eventually it comes out.  It just feels too cruel.  Can I...  You want me to tell my story about a micropenis and a cop?  A micropenis on a cop?  A micropenis, my micropenis story involving a cop.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  All right.  Someone's like, put your hands up. 
[02:55:30]  Your dick sucks.  All right.  And this is on camera.  How drunk were you when you were driving home?  You ever have one of those days when you're driving long distances and all the compiled  injuries, you've suffered nerve damage, the lower back, they combine to create the  loss of sensation so you can no longer feel your genitalia as you're driving.  You know those days.  Yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  I would love that.  Happens to the best of us.  And you literally, although on one level you know it's still there, you can't feel  it, and so I got pulled over for speeding because I was reaching down to make sure my 
[02:56:00]  penis still existed.  And when I got pulled over and I was asked why I was speeding, I said, I can't find my  penis.  And that was my excuse, and I got off.  Was it there?  It was there.  It was kind of tucked away.  It was scared.  It was hiding.  Your dick was like in a fucking, like a shame curl under your fucking ass cheek.  Taking a nap.  Are you going crazy?  You know, it's...  Is he going crazy?  No, this is a true story.  But you're driving and...  Where would your penis go? 
[02:56:30]  You left the house with it.  Where the fuck could it be?  It just, you lose the sensation if you've...  If you've dropped elbows on concrete for 20 years, and then I just momentarily couldn't  find it, and I reached down for it, I put my foot on the pedal, I got pulled over, and  my excuse was, I can't find my penis!  And was it a lady cop?  And she just reached out and she's like, here it is, sir.  Or he lets you go.  And we had a bass line that came in that went boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Do they still have bass lines in porn? 
[02:57:00]  Porns?  Yeah.  Not so much.  I always thought that...  I have a twin brother, and when I was a kid, I always thought I was going to grow a dick.  It was like really confusing for me.  I couldn't understand.  I kept asking my mom how my dick was going to grow in.  It didn't?  I don't know why.  That's just a very...  We all looked at that story, and like, we know you're serious, and there's something  really interesting about that, and no one knew where to go with it.  No, we were all trying to...  That is actually fairly...  I just, we used to like bounce on the bed after we would take baths, and just, we had a song 
[02:57:30]  like, it would be like, I have, you have a penis, I have a vagina, and we would just  sing that, but I just never got it.  I always thought...  That's a story that I could like hug you for, or I could just go home and jerk off to.  Either option is acceptable.  I don't think he's...  I think I was mulling over those options in my mind, too, because I was realizing that  I'm looking at a beautiful young lady who's using the word dick and grow in the same  sentence, and I'm just feeling sad.  Are you a dirty talk...  I can't believe you think I'm young.  Thank you.  You are young.  Yeah.  Are you a dirty talk guy, or are you a...  I do like it, but I like it sparingly, so that's why I rarely use the words in real 
[02:58:00]  life, so that way they take on a greater meaning when they're exercised in the fully bedroom.  What turns you on when a woman says to you?  You know, I do enjoy my wife dropping the occasional F-bomb, as long as it's occasional.  Is it saying...  As long as it's occasional.  Is it what you have, a faggot?  You fucking faggot.  That would be me fucking someone.  Fuck you. 
[02:58:30]  Wow.  Jesus.  Is it...  Tough room, Mick.  Tough room today, huh?  Yeah.  She's turning on me.  No, I'm on your side.  I'm on your side.  Is it like, oh, fuck me, or I fucking...  Is it like an aggressive thing, or saying, like, or any woman, it doesn't have to be a  wife, but is it, I want you to fuck me?  Well, no, it would have to be my wife.  But I mean, in general, I'm not trying to ask...  I don't...  Wink.  You know what?  It can't be used...  It has to be used as a verb.  You know, it can't...  Okay.  Like, when I watch...  Like, you wouldn't turn you on...  That's a verb.  If someone just said, ah, you know...  Good morning, verb. 
[02:59:00]  Like, the girl that just sits on the porn and says, oh, F yeah, F yeah, is using the  word incorrectly.  You know, it's got to be used...  For you.  For me.  For your purposes.  For my purposes.  Gotcha.  So, I don't know if I feel comfortable getting this intimate with you guys about my intimacy.  That's fine.  That's very interesting.  But is it appropriate for Santa Claus to ever use the F word?  No.  No.  Is that a good question?  No.  Brings it back around to Santa Claus obsession?  You want to know...  Here.  You want to know about traumatic events?  All right?  Oh, my God.  Okay.  This is...  Can I just say that I'm fully scared of you? 
[02:59:30]  All right.  Okay.  You will be there.  You should be.  And I'm going to use one here.  And this is why I don't go there very often.  Because you never know.  I remember that the movie with John Travolta is The Attorney, where he said, you never actually  ask a question unless you know the answer.  And so, you know, when you get this toy...  Did he really say that?  He did.  He should have practiced that as massage therapy fucking experiences.  Sessions.  Yeah, exactly.  So, you're just fucking going for it.  Well, in the late 80s, when I was in Texas, and I was on my brief six-month run that I 
[03:00:00]  would have to live vicariously through for the rest of my life, the memories, you know,  I actually thought I invented the phrase, tell me what I'm doing to you.  Tell me what I'm doing to you, because you want to hear that word.  And then this Texas girl goes, you're fucking me, I reckon.  And it just...  No kidding.  It just took the...  I reckon.  You're fucking me, I reckon.  It just kind of took the zing out of it for me for a while.  Where's Tambor, man?  I just texted.  He's hopefully on his way over. 
[03:00:30]  I don't know.  Do we know that he's on his way over?  No.  Roland's checking.  He's supposed to walk over after Morning Joe.  Oh, the Morning Joe.  I don't know if he did Morning Joe.  We're not.  But yeah, weird things, it changes what will turn me on to hear.  Certain words, trigger words, are very fucking sexy.  Nick, let's hear it.  What?  I can't think of what...  When certain women have talked to me about fucking other guys, it's turned me on a lot.  But it has to be genuine.  It can't be porno.  And not in conversation, but I mean in a dirty fuck sense. 
[03:01:00]  But it can't be porno-like.  Yeah.  It's got to be genuine and real.  It wouldn't turn me on.  Porn stuff, like porn lingo, wouldn't turn me on.  Yeah, it's gross.  Because you know it would be fake.  Yeah, it's got to be something...  Well, you know what was real?  The actresses, I hate it.  Should we talk about this?  And this was...  You have to realize, this is at a time when I didn't realize I was suffering the aftermath  of too many head injuries, where we had Ginger Lynn in.  And I thought you and Andy were... 
[03:01:30]  Anthony.  Anthony.  You and Andy.  Head injuries!  You and Anthony.  I thought you were being a little tough on Ginger.  Ginger?  I was very nice to Ginger.  You were nice, and Sam was there, we had to turn off the camera.  I felt like, because she had a segment on her show called, Can My Vagina Melt This?  Right.  Right?  And then, so the boys were trying to create...  They were trying to come up with items that...  I love that.  That's great.  That she could use.  Al Gore actually used her pussy in his documentary. 
[03:02:00]  So, somewhere, I just came out with it.  You guys were here, right?  I was like, what if instead we see how long it takes Ginger to have an orgasm on my knee?  Like, I don't know where that came from.  I do.  The desire to have her rub her vagina on your knee.  And to try to squeeze it into a legitimate bit so you don't have a divorce filed.  I know exactly where it came from.  Who are you kidding?  We closed the curtains, right?  Yes, we did.  And now, the reason I knew she was easily orgasmic is because I had seen her when she 
[03:02:30]  and Christy Canyon host Playboy Radio, I had seen Ginger have an orgasm while giving Christy,  while manually stimulating Christy, I thought.  Was it real?  Yeah, you could.  The face went all flush and everything.  It wasn't like she was pretending to have one.  I mean, she had a legit explosion.  And so I knew she was easily orgasmic.  And so, in my mind, that had been rattled so many times, I thought, why not see how quickly 
[03:03:00]  she can have an orgasm on my knee?  That's a great idea.  And we took little wagers on it, and I exceeded all expectations.  Turns out I've got a heck of a knee.  This is not helping your Santa Claus thing.  They're completely different people.  The bad Mick who was on that couch over there in Santa, that was head injury Mick.  That's right.  This is not a couch.  This is pussy knees.  But why were we bad to her?  You know what?  I thought you were pressuring her a little bit.  Just a little bit.  So I made her cum on my knee. 
[03:03:30]  A little bit.  What were you supposed to do?  I don't know.  So I forced her to jizz all over my neck.  You're nice to Ginger Lynn.  But you know what?  It was really a nice moment.  It took 28 seconds.  She embraced me.  That can't be real.  She came in 28 seconds.  We were here, right?  She wasn't faking it.  It was real.  I never believed porn.  I never believed in orgasm.  If I'm fucking a girl and she goes, I'm coming, I just want to stop and go.  But she didn't say that.  She was shuddering.  And look, not that I have a lot of...  Maybe they're afraid you're going to cum and they want you to stop.  But here's the thing.  I went right from O&A and I went downstairs and I did the out cue. 
[03:04:00]  I did a PSA for out cue about bullying.  And they fought to get on your knee.  What's that icky smell?  Hold on.  Dogs are just sniffing my knee.  I'm talking.  Why are these dogs sniffing my knee?  It was a very sensitive, anti-bullying PSA.  Bullying is a very serious subject.  And it wasn't until I was walking out of the building here that I was like, I don't know  if I should have done that.  You know, like... 
[03:04:30]  Oh, stop.  Never talking about ginger, not the PSA.  Yeah, stop.  I was glad I did that.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah, who cares if you're talking about bullying and you have to basically, you know, watching  a girl get bullied into cumming on your leg?  There's nothing hypocritical at all about that.  You got what you needed and that's all that really matters.  It's not the way I saw the story, Norris.  I was the prince in Night in Shining Armor.  28 seconds to orgasm?  Yeah, that's...  I mean, it's not real.  I got a knee and we have a couch here, Annie, if you want to...  I felt like it wasn't real. 
[03:05:00]  I felt like it wasn't real.  No, it was.  I like Tracy Lord.  She came in here.  She was cool.  I wish I was here that day.  I loved her fucking slow...  She was a lot of fun.  They made a unique shape to him, didn't they?  God, was she good, man.  Well, that's because she was 16 at the time.  16, yeah.  Tom Byron used to date her.  You didn't know?  No, nobody knew.  They destroyed all that material.  Yeah, you can still get it.  Statement.  Jimmy with just a statement.  Yeah, that was a fucking...  There was no punchline there. 
[03:05:30]  Can I ask you a question, Annie?  Yeah.  He's coming up now, by the way.  You were surprised that I thought you were a young lady.  How far off am I when I say 30?  You're two months off.  All right, okay.  That's not bad then, right?  That's really young by my...  I mean, I was...  I guess sort of...  You should never...  If you're a girl and you joke about how old you are, people are always going to think  you're so much older.  You're like, I'm not a...  You know...  I remember I had a friend who was like...  She's like...  Said something about...  Oh, I'm 30 as a joke. 
[03:06:00]  And the guy goes, you don't look a day over like 29.  She was fucking...  Oh, Jesus.  ...22.  Right.  You're going to find out what people think real fast.  Who cares, though?  I don't give a shit about getting older.  I just wish I had more money to not be borrowing money from my dad.  It would be great.  You're getting there.  So here's an Amazon wish list, guys.  Yeah.  Give my dad his money back.  I didn't do that.  We got Jeffrey Tambor coming in, so really fast, the Caroline Show, because I know you  want to get that out there.  Yeah, Caroline's is...  June 1st, you said?  June 1st.  Week from Sunday.  Yeah.  Yeah, tickets are moving really, really nicely, so there's about 50 left, and honestly, 
[03:06:30]  I look at this, this is the biggest thing I've done, because I think it's going to get  the...  If WWE gets on board, it'll be going to get so much easier to...  But they're filming it for what?  To figure out something?  They're filming it so that guys like Vince can watch it, because I think they get...  But what would Vince do, then?  Well, they've got their own network.  Oh, okay.  I mean, it would be a nice springboard for me.  You know, I was talking with Colin Quinn last night on the Artie Lang Show, and he said,  you know, Comedy Central's so jammed with, you know, with acts that it's hard to stand 
[03:07:00]  out, but if you were the one guy that was, say, on USA, and there was a special, it might...  Because I really do think, and you don't hear me come on and brag about my wrestling  or my books, but I really think if people just checked out, and once they see the show,  they get it and they like it, and I think this will help people get it and like it.  What a piece of shit Colin is.  Jeffrey Tamar outside the studio.  I'm so sorry.  You're gesturing what we want to say to Mick Foley. 
[03:07:30]  Just wrap it up.  Wrap it up.  Hurry up a little bit.  Hurry up.  Remember when she was friendly?  Those were the days.  Fucking Jeffrey Tamar.  He gets me.  That's Annie Letterman, and that's Mick Foley.  Are you a Letterman?  No.  I'm all with a D.  With a D, yeah.  Nice to meet you.  I'm Jeffrey, and I'm very sorry, but we can bank some afterwards if you want.  It's okay.  Whatever you want to do, man.  We're all good.  We're on the air.  It's all good.  Oh, we are?  Yeah.  Just coming in with an apology. 
[03:08:00]  That's how I start everything, too.  That's my whole life.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  That's my whole life.  It's the way I live.  Hello.  I'm sorry.  Good thing we didn't play his theme music when he walked in.  What is my theme music?  Oh, we have wonderful theme music for you.  Are we on this as well?  No, no cameras.  Oh, no cameras.  Can we get one?  Thanks.  Well, we got a sad one over here.  Look at this sad camera we got.  Oh.  Sad camera guy.  Yeah, it's just...  I bet if you're Fox News, you got something to say this morning.  Over what happened in London, you mean?  Anyway, let's talk. 
[03:08:30]  What's going on?  I'm trying to do an interview.  Oh, I know, but I was just trying to spark something.  I see something sparking.  What?  Yes.  Where's his theme music?  What theme music?  It's in the headphones.  Is it the Arrested Development?  No, no.  Do you recognize this music, sir?  It's the greatest music ever.  Huh?  Not bad, right?  Huh?  You're listening to it with the guy here.  Is that my theme music? 
[03:09:00]  What is it?  Oh, my God.  You don't recognize it?  It's the Ropers.  Oh.  Is that my uncle?  My uncle used to play this when he tickled me.  Let's talk more about that.  I think that's a whole hour right there.  Oh, it is.  And we got that hour.  Yeah, you remember that Norman Felt dancing with the plunger?  I love my Norman.  We used to go to lunch the day of ratings.  On Tuesday, the ratings would come out,  and there would be this sweat on his upper lip.  Because I think the deal with Norman was, 
[03:09:30]  after a certain number,  he couldn't go back to Three's Company.  Right.  And that was...  Norman was an intellectual.  Did you know that?  No.  Oh.  Yeah.  Did you, Mick?  I did not know that.  Wait, why couldn't he go back to Three's Company  after a certain number of episodes?  Contract.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Those were different days.  How long did you guys last?  I think we did two seasons.  I didn't think we would do one season.  I just said, oh, I'll just do this.  And I didn't know anything about television. 
[03:10:00]  I knew nothing.  But I had so much fun.  Get this.  The same year I did The Ropers,  I did Anjustice for All.  Oh.  Wow.  That was Jeffrey.  And so there it is.  I mean, the same act it does The Ropers.  No kidding.  That's showing a little range, huh?  Yeah.  Which, by the way, as you were talking,  as you were talking about The Ropers and Norman Felt,  I was thinking of your monologue in Anjustice for All.  When you go to Pacino's house and you're drunk  and fucking Earl Soames did it again. 
[03:10:30]  I was so nervous.  Such a great movie.  That was the first film.  I didn't know what a mark was.  I didn't know anything.  I didn't know what an...  Oh, there's a thing called an apple box.  Yes.  And if you go out of frame,  you know, I had my first shot,  I had a valise and I kept going out of frame.  And the guy said,  do you want to put that on an apple?  Do you want an apple or a half apple?  And yes, I said, no, thank you.  I'll wait for lunch.  And that's when they knew.  Oh, no.  They had a name. 
[03:11:00]  I'd never done a film.  I didn't know what a mark was.  That's unbelievable.  That would have been so...  That would have been a great joke, though.  What?  If you could have played it off like you meant it.  Oh, your uncle called, by the way.  What did he say?  He said, just come on over tonight.  He's dead.  And that's why...  I killed him, self-defense.  Really?  Yeah.  Because it was really...  It was very...  Because it took him a long time to say that.  What was your question?  I just...  There's no question.  I just think that would be...  That would have been a good joke.  You could have played it off as a joke. 
[03:11:30]  Which one?  You said, I'm waiting for lunch.  Oh, no.  I was too nervous.  You know, my father told me,  always ask a question.  I was too nervous.  Thank you, Jeff.  What did you mean, always ask a question?  I adjusted Jeffrey's microphone.  If you have a question, like you say,  are we on TV or are we...  I asked a question, but I was always too nervous to.  I was always too proud, you know?  Yeah.  And you got to ask, you know?  I mean, I did not know that when you do a close-up 
[03:12:00]  that they measure it with a...  You know, I didn't know any of this stuff.  Thank God for Al Pacino.  He just took care of me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He knew it was your first film.  Everybody.  Have you done anything as fun in a movie  as throwing those plates down the hall?  How much fun was that?  You know, in the Baltimore courthouse,  there's still chipped marble.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because I threw real plates.  No kidding.  And I went there the day before, 
[03:12:30]  and I was a very different kind of actor  than I am now.  I rehearsed too much.  I went to the theater three and four hours  before the performance.  I was not improvisational.  I worried a lot.  So I actually ruined that movie,  which is a very, very fine movie,  with worry.  I can't watch it.  Really?  Yeah.  Don't worry.  That's a great movie.  The only thing I didn't like about  Justice for All was the music.  I thought the music choices were a little weird, 
[03:13:00]  like certain movies have weird music.  Were you asking you for your criticism?  No, not at all.  I was literally weighing in.  No, I was always segwaying back  into how good you are.  Oh, okay.  Well, let's just see.  What is some of your opinion?  Have you read any good books lately?  Tell us what you're thinking.  It was coming back to how great you are, though.  Yes, I was just using it  as kind of a springboard  backing to your wonderfulness.  It's just a little bridge  to get back to how great you are.  You remember who that was  because it was a very, very big composer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jeffrey hated it, too.  I had a problem with the movie, too, 
[03:13:30]  but I'm not sure I want to bring it up.  What was your problem?  Oh, my God.  Don't bring it up, Mick.  It's seeing John Forsyth in Bondage Gear  after knowing him.  Remember that?  How great was that?  Charlie and Blake Carrington  and now he's in Bondage Gear.  Do you know what I did not know?  I didn't know what to do on your day off  because, and I would just go to the set.  I did not know.  I did not know what to do with that energy, you know?  It was just very weird.  Can we look up the... 
[03:14:00]  Was that weird for you to be on set?  Can you go online and look up the composer of...  And Justice.  And Justice for All.  How great...  And then would you check my email?  Why was the music bad?  It was just weird.  It was weird.  Is it because it doesn't hold up?  No, it's just a bizarre choice.  Or at the time, it was still bad, do you think?  Pacino's running up the street in one scene.  They just didn't need it, right?  Dominic Chienise was in that movie.  He played as...  He fucking...  Oh, he was great.  He was fantastic.  He's a good friend of mine.  Yeah, he was great in that.  Forsyth was great.  Hang a man for armed robbery, Arthur.  How about Jack Warden? 
[03:14:30]  Amazing.  I remember I was going to...  He says, where are you going?  I said, I'm going to Daly's.  And he said, what are you doing that for?  And I said, oh, because I want to check it.  He goes, what if you don't like them?  And I went, you're right.  I never went to Daly's.  You ever see a Jack Warden movie called  Use Cars, Replayed Two Rolls?  Oh, my goodness.  Have you seen him in The Verdict?  Have you seen him in The Verdict?  Yes or no?  I don't remember.  Then forget about it.  He took you away.  I think I did. 
[03:15:00]  The Verdict is one of the great movies of all time.  Did he play a judge?  In The Verdict, no.  He played Paul Newman's sort of a friend.  I did see it then.  I remember the Newman in that movie.  Oh, you're lying to me.  No, no, no.  I would never lie to you.  He's just haven't seen it in a while.  I would rather just be...  What do you want me to look up?  Composer.  Composer for Injustice for All.  Yeah, it's dot, dot, dot, Injustice.  And then could you look up Merrill Lynch?  I want to check my balance.  I'd love to know your balance.  Nick Foley's here because he's a huge fan of Arrested Development. 
[03:15:30]  I am.  And I know that's why Jeffrey Tambor is here in the end.  Am I here for four hours?  You can hang for four.  We're not going to be here, but enjoy yourself.  Well, I don't understand.  What am I doing?  Promoting Arrested Development.  I really don't know what you're doing.  Do you know, I did a series somewhat based...  Do you know about this?  What?  Well, I don't know if I can talk about this.  Can you keep that down?  I mean, I can't.  I'm so bad at this.  It was...  What was it?  Dave Gruson.  Yeah, you said that. 
[03:16:00]  You did not.  I did.  I said Dave Gruson.  Did I not hear that?  Yeah, he did say it.  Dave Gruson.  Just before you did.  Who was...  That's like Danny Elfman now.  Dave Gruson.  I'll nod.  Like, I know who that is.  I don't know who that is.  You know who Elfman?  Danny.  You don't know who Danny Elfman is?  Of course I do, but the audience doesn't, so I'm playing their part.  The Oingo Boingo guy.  I'm just getting Metallica.  The Oingo Boingo guy.  I don't know.  I don't know if that's how he wants to be remembered.  Why?  He's not proud of the Oingo Boingo, but he's done Batman.  He's done so many great... 
[03:16:30]  He's done weird science.  He's done everything.  Remember?  Well, yeah, that was pre...  He's the Oingo Boingo guy.  He actually...  What's wrong with that?  There's nothing wrong with being the Oingo Boingo guy, but he's done so many great compositions.  Since then.  Can we get back to Jeffrey, please, and how much I loved when he fucking took his toupee  off and went, hello, Arthur.  Nice day.  And then put it back on like it was a hat.  And there were two endings.  One was Chris Lottie whistling through her fingers like, attaboy.  And there was that ending, which was the original ending that Barry and Valerie wrote. 
[03:17:00]  And get this.  Because I just did the Phil Spector story with Al Pacino.  Oh my God, you played Cutler.  That's right.  And Barry Levinson was the exec producer.  This is why God made a circle, by the way.  I mean, unbelievable.  You played Bruce Cutler.  Yeah, I did just see that.  I thought it was fantastic.  Do you know Bruce Cutler?  I know who he is.  Of course.  Do you ever see him?  Yes.  It's John Gotti's lawyer, yeah.  Yeah.  Sure.  What did he call you?  He's going to crucify you on the stand.  That's what Gotti would say about Bruce Cutler, because he was such a good fucking cross 
[03:17:30]  examiner.  Jimmy ranted about the movie.  I thought it was amazing, yeah.  He loved it.  I didn't know.  I knew what some of Spector's work.  Yeah.  But to watch Pacino work that, and just see how crazy he was when he saw Ronnie Spector  interview, it was fucking cool.  And Helen Mirren.  Oh, she was fantastic.  Helen Mirren's in the movie.  Oh, you want to talk about Helen Mirren again?  Thank you.  Would you like to tell Jeffrey Tim?  You haven't seen it?  I have not seen it.  And yet I'm here as a guest.  Yeah.  I'm a fan.  Jeffrey, the reason that you asked me to sit in on this interview is...  Oh, yeah, please.  Is...  Is...  Is...  I'm actually a little starstruck, because I just tweeted out... 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, you never get starstruck.  McFoley?  A couple weeks ago, you can go look at the historical record.  I said, why am I just finding out about Arrested Development now?  And I got flooded with all these things.  I didn't know it was coming back to Netflix.  I saw it on a flight to London, and I thought, where is this show?  I knew about it, but...  And even people I trusted told me, it's a great show.  Yeah, I got to watch it.  Yeah.  It wasn't until I went to London I saw this and went, why have I not been watching this  thing all along? 
[03:18:30]  I was just in London, and we were just there, and I had no idea we had the following that  we have.  And, I mean, consider this.  I know we're goofing around, but consider this.  At 12.01, on May 26th, or 3.01 our time back here, someone's going to press a button,  and it's going to go all over the world.  It's crazy.  That's insane.  I'm going to tell you how much I love Arrested Development, and the guys will have to vouch  for me via the fact that I have a t-shirt of me as Santa Claus, which I would like to 
[03:19:00]  present to you, and you can feel free to do it if you like.  I have this laundered, please.  Thank you.  Thank you.  This is the highest compliment I can pay a show.  He loves his Santa Claus shirt.  Usually, before I go to bed, I will watch something Christmassy to help me get to sleep.  I mean, that's so weird.  And in the past two weeks since I've returned home from the UK, it's Arrested Development  every night.  Wow.  That's really strange.  I have no idea if you watch Christmas stuff to go to bed. 
[03:19:30]  You know, we're very, very proud of it.  I mean, there's 15 of them.  We love Mitch.  It almost approached Newtonian physics to get that nine people together.  Yeah, yeah.  Because thankful, I mean, thanks to the show, a lot of us have gone on, not Jason Bateman  so much.  He's had a tough time.  A lot of us have gone on.  And it's hard for us to get in a room.  So when we were all in a room, it was amazing. 
[03:20:00]  I'm glad you liked it.  It's great.  It's honestly the first show in years that I've, you know, when my mom comes over,  I'm like, Mom, you have to watch this.  When my oldest son comes home from college, you have to watch this.  All right, wait, wait, wait.  But more importantly, Christmas shit to fall asleep?  To go to bed?  Thank you, Annie.  We can't let that go.  No, no, I can relate.  Because before I go to sleep, I think of two things.  I think of my Hanukkah and my bar mitzvah.  So I understand.  That's great.  That's also what I think about your bar mitzvah when I go to bed.  And Mr. Tambor, have you ever been in a Christmas movie? 
[03:20:30]  So maybe Mick could see that before he goes to bed.  Yeah, well, nothing like, you mean like the Grinch?  Oh, the holiday cheermeister.  Huh?  You were the holiday cheermeister?  Yeah.  I am mayor of Whoville.  Yes, he certainly is.  Yeah.  See?  And then, uh.  Oh, my God.  The weird boner that's happening right now.  Who did you play in MASH?  In MASH, I played a public relations guy.  I called my mother. 
[03:21:00]  I said, Mom, I'm on MASH.  And she watched it.  And she says, she called me.  And she said, I didn't like your costume.  I said, that is the uniform of the United States Army.  She goes, it's not for you.  That's a Jewish mother.  That was her.  She was worried about her boy.  I know, my son.  Can I ask you?  Oh, can I tell you?  And my son said, oh, wait a minute.  I got to tell you, please.  Sure.  Because he just said it.  He's working me for an action figure.  He's eight years old.  And I said, I think I'm going to get that for you. 
[03:21:30]  And he said, oh, from the backseat of the car, he said, oh, and by the way, love your work.  I am not kidding.  He's a smart kid.  Is he single?  Yeah.  He's eight.  How I heard.  What type of action figure was he looking for?  Uh, he, you know, he's into Legos and I, this, uh, these action figures, I, I, I.  Any wrestling yet?  No.  Okay.  No.  Okay.  Does he like wrestling and Santa?  Are you into wrestling? 
[03:22:00]  That's true.  That's what I do.  He was a superstar for many years.  Yeah.  One of the, one of the greats.  You know, I got to say something all the time.  I got to do it.  This hurts, Jeffrey.  Now, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Because I get this all the time.  All the time.  People say, love your work, Mr. Arkin.  Uh, I actually, and I swear to God in my dad's, my dad's memory, I recognized you when  I walked in.  I swear to you.  I just didn't place it.  It's okay.  Right.  It may have been celebrity wife's mom.  Because I watch porn and I, I thought maybe that was it. 
[03:22:30]  Did you recognize me?  We've met.  Have we?  Very humiliating.  Where did we meet?  Well, we've met twice.  We interviewed you once a couple years ago at Comic-Con with the Sigourney Weaver film.  Oh, of course.  I would remember that.  I hope so.  Because there wasn't, there wasn't anybody around.  And do you not remember our moment together?  Uh, let me see that, Jim.  I look like there's something wrong with me.  What the heck is that?  It was, uh, you had just done Glenn Gary, Glenn Ross with Alan Alda.  Yeah.  And, uh.  You look good.  Thank you.  I look fat.  No, you don't look fat.  No, you do.  Jimmy, you look like shit.  You look like a corpse.  A bloated corpse. 
[03:23:00]  That was with, uh, you remember that Sigourney went out in that crowd?  And that's dangerous.  I don't, we interviewed you at a small table.  There was no fans there.  I do remember you.  I remember you.  I do remember you.  Oh.  He's shaking his head no.  This is sadder.  This is sadder.  Yeah, but Jimmy was 30, 40 pounds heavier.  30 pounds, I'd say.  I mean, he was a fat little pig.  How did you lose your weight?  Uh, just the gym and eating better.  Tell them Weight Watchers.  Yeah.  No, I have no, just, just a lot of hard work.  Yeah.  It is hard. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  I used to weigh 270 pounds.  Wow.  Yeah.  You look good.  Thank you.  Yeah, you're good.  What are you down to now?  269.  That's killer.  I can't do this.  Great.  Am I?  Yes.  Yes.  What was your, uh, uh, what was your, mankind or just, let me ask you this.  Sure.  Is the wrestler not one of the great movies of all time?  It is a great movie.  Great.  It's a great movie.  It is.  And did he not nail that?  I walked in skeptical and I, I reviewed it for, for slate.com. 
[03:24:00]  They wanted a wrestler's take on it.  And I walked in not wanting to like it.  Of course.  Within 10 minutes.  I was like, this guy, he's not doing an imitation of anyone, but I've seen this guy.  Yeah.  There's so many shades of guys that I've known over the years.  He's not, if you want to see something, you must, and I was there and he did it.  You must see his acceptance speech at the Golden Globes.  No, independent.  Oh, really?  Okay.  It is the funniest, foulest, offbeat, most wonderful speech I've ever seen. 
[03:24:30]  No kidding.  Wow.  What an actor this guy is.  You know, uh, you know Chuck Zito, right?  Of course.  I've known Chuck from just being around, but Chuck's not the guy who calls me at my house.  And I got a call from him one night and he was like, Hey, it's Chuck Zito.  Hey Chuck, how you doing?  He goes, I got somebody who wants to say hello to you.  And he put Mickey on the phone because I was the first wrestler that he'd gotten feedback from  that wasn't involved with the film.  Yeah.  And he was just really grateful that I thought that he'd, he'd nailed it.  I mean, I loved it.  Cause he played a real person. 
[03:25:00]  He didn't play a caricature of a wrestler.  He just played a real guy and a father and you know, just a regular struggling guy.  It was good.  I hadn't, I liked nine and a half weeks when I was a preteen.  That explains a lot about you.  That was my first, uh, spank, shall we say?  And, um, and so to see him, I mean, he definitely changed physically, but it was like the perfect  role for what had happened to his physical appearance.  When you, uh, uh, when you, uh, do you now have physical ailments because of wrestling? 
[03:25:30]  Oh man, it's bad.  He's hurt.  Bad.  Uh, yeah, I actually, it was the first time I called Delta as I'm going to Columbus, Ohio.  And it's the first time I ever requested wheelchair assistance.  Bad back day today.  I got out of bed.  I was like, ah, this is not going to be a good day.  I had a very, uh, physically punishing, uh, style that I chose when I was 19 that no longer  seemed like such a good idea when I hit my thirties, not staples.  I hope everything, everything. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's missing an ear.  Yeah.  Are you?  Yeah.  Let me see.  Really?  Jeffrey Tambor wants to see the missing ear.  Right.  Sure.  That's pretty cool.  I got to show you the good one first.  There's the good one.  Beautiful.  It's a perfect ear.  Why are you missing it?  Uh, it was one of those moves that didn't work out like I'd hoped.  Uh, you know, I got caught up in the ropes and, uh, in Germany, ropes a little too tight.  And, uh, you know, when I pulled out of the, the ropes and I'd had my ears injured before.  So when I was, was down on the mat, I could see the blood dripping down pretty quickly. 
[03:26:30]  And I thought, geez, you know, the ear's mostly cartilage.  It's not likely to bleed back there.  And we had this unique situation because our two English speaking referees had been sent  home.  One because of a knee injury, one due to a death in the family.  We had a French referee who was unable to tell us that he had my ear.  Oh!  He couldn't just show you?  You know what?  I mean, it all goes by.  There's a grainy, there's some footage on the new DVD, like a handheld from Germany. 
[03:27:00]  Oh, man, that is crazy.  And he actually hands it to the, uh, to the ring announcer who can be seen like literally  running to the back with it.  And we kept, we kept wrestling.  That's what I'm going to watch when I go to bed now.  Me too.  I mean.  And do you want to hear a story of this?  I was talking to the guy.  You're going to ask Jeffrey Tambor.  I don't often, I don't often drop an F-bomb, but I will hear it.  And you have to preface this, but I have to preface this by saying Booker T is a tough  dude in the world of wrestling.  He did some time in jail and he's written about for armed robbery and he got into wrestling. 
[03:27:30]  Tough guy.  And he was on his first overseas trip with, uh, with the group I was wrestling with.  And he said, when I walked in, this is his first glimpse of me.  I walked in, I just lost my ear and I said, I walked in and I said, I think I just lost  my fucking ear.  Bang, bang.  Which is the catchphrase.  And Booker T said he was in the corner going, I'm not sure this business is for me, man.  Oh my God.  Yeah.  Because you're kind of on that like adrenaline rush.  That's what happens after you've been injured.  You like, you come down after that.  But you're a young man.  Are you 40? 
[03:28:00]  40.  Almost 48, Jeffrey.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So.  Appreciate that.  You do look young.  Yeah, you look good.  Appreciate that.  And now I know people come up to you and say, there's always, can you say there's always  money in the banana stand?  A young man came up to me in the airport the other day and I said, uh, you want a picture?  He goes, I just want you to do something.  Oh my gosh.  Well-dressed, handsome.  He said, you have to say there's always money in the banana stand.  I said, that's it?  He went, yeah.  I said, there's always money in the banana stand. 
[03:28:30]  And he got all emotional and walked away.  So we're talking about a fan base here.  What is that from?  Arrested to rest.  And our pal, Patrice, was in that scene.  Patrice O'Neill.  Here's my special request.  Without any exaggeration.  I'll do it.  We have referred to my son, Mickey, whose nickname is Pickle, as the holiday Pickle Meister  since the Grinch.  So if you would utter the words, this year's holiday cheer meister, something along those 
[03:29:00]  lines.  What's the line?  I think it's this year's holiday cheer meister.  We did it perfectly.  But this year's holiday cheer meister.  But I thought you were going to ask me for it, you know, because I have another one that  they shout from Taxi Cabs.  Do you know what it is?  What is it?  Mr. Soames did it again.  They said they'd be fine.  They'd be professional.  But that's fine. 
[03:29:30]  Do you know what it is?  We do not know.  Hey Now.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's the one.  Yeah.  So I have Hey Now.  I know.  And there's always money in the banana stand.  What's Hey Now from?  Come on.  I was just kidding.  Larry Sanders show.  Larry Sanders show.  And now my favorite Hank Kingsley related line was actually uttered by Henry Winkler on  the Larry Sanders show where the Hank Kingsley porn tape had leaked out.  Yes.  Remember that?  And then Henry Winkler, the Fonz, links over to Larry and goes, so Hank's got a tape out 
[03:30:00]  and Larry's really upset about it.  And the Fonz goes, I hear he's got a huge cock though.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Henry is responsible for one of the biggest laughs I've ever heard.  We were at the DGA screening of Arrested Development.  And if you remember from when he plays my lawyer.  Yes.  And Mitch had him do this take in the bathroom where just before we leave, he looks into the 
[03:30:30]  mirror and he does the take as Barry Zuckerhorn, but he does the Fonz take with the hair.  And the audience went, these are adults.  They went crazy.  That is, by the way, the nicest man.  Yes.  We say that all the time.  No.  He's the real deal.  And I keep looking for the wink like he's an ass, but he's not.  It doesn't happen, huh?  No. 
[03:31:00]  He is nice.  He's almost too nice.  That's what we say.  He's been on the show a bunch and we just feel like there's something that we just don't  understand about him.  I actually heard his feelings.  We were having lunch once and I said, you're bored, aren't you?  Because I can't believe.  I'm looking at the publicist from Caroline's where I'm doing a show on June 1st.  Sorry.  In the middle of a Jeffrey Tambor story.  I just gave him a thumbs up in the middle of a Jeffrey Tambor story.  About Henry Winkler?  No.  He's a man who deserves an explanation and that's why I gave the thumbs up. 
[03:31:30]  And the date, huh?  I ask about your ear and you do the thumbs up for Caroline's.  What are your roots?  Where are you from?  Where are your parents from?  My mom was adopted and my dad's mom was adopted, but people speak Russian to me.  And when I'm in, if I'm in Greenpoint frowning, they speak Polish.  Polish, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You have that sad Eastern European.  No, no, you have a Slavic, beautiful Slavic face. 
[03:32:00]  Thank you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, you're smiling.  Oh, Annie's smiling.  It's the first time I've ever smiled.  This feels strange and new.  First time in two hours.  I just shot it in Greenpoint.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  What'd you shoot?  What?  Business.  I'm serious.  It's where my heritage is.  I love Greenpoint.  It's the best bakeries in the world.  Still laughing.  Holy shit.  So you guys basically, you can wear anything you want when you come to work. 
[03:32:30]  Obviously.  That's got to set a culture.  Why do I sign up for this job?  I got to get dressed up.  Look at me.  I got to get dressed up.  You're TV ready.  You were doing some TV for Arrested Development, season four.  Yeah.  I was just on MSNBC.  On Morning Joe.  I love them.  Yeah.  He's a good guy.  Yeah.  He was my congressman when I lived in Florida.  Was he a congressman?  Yeah, he was.  Yeah, Joe.  I was in the Florida Panhandle for a few years.  I mean, you look exactly like you lived in Florida.  What's your lowest moment in your life?  In my entire life? 
[03:33:00]  Yeah, hit it.  Let's go low moments.  You know what?  I got to tell you, I wasn't feeling too good when I went on stage.  Caroline's?  No, no.  Caroline's going to be great.  Okay.  And I literally said, I went up there, you know, Broadway, you get like ten or eight  or nine, ten good comics.  Amy Schumer was up there.  Oh, Amy's great.  And then Judah goes on and Judah kills.  And I told the guys from Wounded Warriors, hey, I used to do some comedy if you guys want  me to come up there.  And they called me up.  They go, okay, Mick Foley.  And then I went up there and I tried to change my set because people were already using references. 
[03:33:30]  And at a certain point, I just said, if I was in a pool, I'd ask for a life preserver  because I'm drowning up here.  What did the audience do?  You know, when I came back, Judah was there.  He goes, dude, a few things.  First of all, you never come out of a crowd when you're doing a set.  And I went, I go, I think I go, also, man, don't think this is the wrong way, but if  most comics go up there and don't get a laugh for four minutes, they're dead.  But they were at least listening to you.  And then he said, I might want to actually have some jokes in my set.  Oh, wow. 
[03:34:00]  But I remember that feeling, just that helpless feeling of being up there.  And, man, I'm a guy that had been in front of 20,000 people many times, and you could  feel like you'd get them in the palm of your hand, and now you're in front of 200, and you're  just dying.  So you felt guilty, basically, that you had further depressed Wounded Warriors?  Yeah.  My lowest moment.  I've had lower, but that's the one that's front of mine.  My lowest moment was doing a bounce commercial in New York.  I'm a New Yorker.  And I couldn't do, hey, my socks don't cling correctly, because my hands were shaking  so badly.  And the executive producer yelled from the back of the shooting studio, how many fucking 
[03:34:30]  actors in this city?  That's a true story.  And I cried for two days.  I just got the image of Rocky Balboa doing a commercial on Rocky II.  He goes, when I go out with the guys, I like to smell like a jungle rat.  It's cat rock.  It's cat.  And then he does the, I like to smear mainly.  And they go, smear mainly? 
[03:35:00]  And they degraded a lot.  And then I started sweating under my arms, and so they got two, two hair dryers under each  armpit.  And the crew was looking like, what a lox.  And I couldn't, as a young actor, my hands shook.  I mean, I would, and that's all I prayed for is, will this ever stop?  Wow.  Yeah.  The hands shaking?  We're being told he's got to leave.  Yeah, he has other press.  Where do I have to go?  They're panicking.  Oh, Caroline.  I got a dick.  I got a dick.  First, I'll see you.  I'm replacing this wrestler guy. 
[03:35:30]  No, they're panicking, saying you got to go.  Hey, you guys, I'm honored.  This is a wonderful show.  He was about to kiss our ass.  And I was about to kiss his ass.  He was about to kiss our ass.  I was going to ask him to sign my picture and everything.  Go ahead, Jeffrey.  Jeffrey, were you about to kiss our ass and he interrupted?  I just need to know.  I was just going to mention, this is an amazing show.  And people need to watch it.  Arrested Development.  Oh.  It's an amazing show.  No, this show's fine.  Mediocre.  And where do I, on this floor, where do I go to get my Sirius Radio re-upped? 
[03:36:00]  I haven't paid my bills.  Is this the right place?  Yeah.  This is it.  Wouldn't that be funny?  Yeah.  For you.  You know that you stopped talking for about 20 minutes.  Have I said something to hurt your feelings?  I love you.  No, I'm enjoying you tremendously.  I'm actually just listening.  Now they're coming in the room to get me.  Jeffrey, it certainly was a pleasure.  Yeah.  I can't imagine that anybody would be better.  Do I have to go to another booth?  Yeah.  I don't know.  They're telling us, you really got to go.  Look, that guy is the one with the glasses.  By the way, you know what I thought he was? 
[03:36:30]  Where does he have to go?  This guy in the trunks?  I thought he was like a homeless person.  That's Roland.  He does his job great, though.  I went, oh, no, Mike.  What am I going to say?  He's a homeless person.  Roland, he thinks you're homeless.  Could you sign our photo?  Thank you.  He thinks you're homeless.  I know.  He's so proud of it.  That's how he dresses, Jeffrey.  He likes being comfortable.  Wasn't that a Zivon song?  Do you sleep in that and then just get out of bed and come in in it?  Roland, the homeless.  It's a particular watch.  Roland, Arrested Development, season four, Netflix.  On Sunday, May 26th, they pushed a button, as Jeffrey Tambor said, and it'll be worldwide. 
[03:37:00]  Can I borrow $20?  You can have $20.  I don't want them back.  I'm a little short.  I'll be happy.  Jimmy, can I have $20?  You certainly can.  Can I come back?  I live here now.  We would love to have you back.  Because I want to start pushing the porn stuff.  Jeffrey Tambor, everyone.  Mick Foley, thank you very much.  Mick's going to continue with Sam, but you've got the big gig at Caroline's June 1st, a week  from Sunday.  That's right.  Then you've got Jim Norton and Annie Letterman, who killed for us today.  Annie was great.  They're working together at the Stress Factory all weekend long. 
[03:37:30]  Tonight through Sunday.  I've just mentioned a website for people across Canada and the U.S., realmickfoley.com for  all upcoming events.  Also, santagetshard.com.  All right.  We'll see you.  Are we off Monday?  I guess we're off Monday.  Thank you.  Not Sam continues.  Sam Roberts.  Bye.  Thanks, Mick.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live. 
[03:38:00]  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yes.  Mick Foley, my guest on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Although, I was getting tweets.  You know, people were asking me if I still get psyched when wrestlers, you know, mention  me.  And I like that you had the decency to call this show what it should be called.  You said on your Facebook, I'm sticking around at 10, to do the Sam Roberts show.  Was I wrong?  No.  I mean, my name's Sam Roberts.  What do people usually call it?  Well, they used to call it after Opie and Anthony Live, because when it was pitched, it 
[03:38:30]  was supposed to be like an Opie and Anthony after show where we talk about it.  But it stopped being that a long time ago.  Well, I'm glad I could do your talents justice then.  That's right.  And we have it that you may be making a cameo for me on June 1st.  Sam, this is a...  I'll explain the role to you later.  You may or may not want to do it.  It's up to you.  But it will be one of the great pops, as we say, in wrestling of either of our lives. 
[03:39:00]  I'll do most anything for a good pop.  You know that, Mick.  I mean, I didn't want you to feed me steak and rice when we first met.  That was the first time, right?  That was our first meeting.  But I did that.  Yeah, and a pretty good lasting friendship since then.  I think so.  How many years ago was that?  Well, my hair was short.  So that was probably...  What year was that, Eric?  2007.  2007.  Six years, yeah.  Yeah.  You've since met my wife.  Yeah.  That's your wife now.  Yes, we're married.  We got married almost a year ago. 
[03:39:30]  And that was the immediate feeling I got was the immediate feeling people used to get when  they'd meet my wife, which is...  How?  How?  Why?  How?  Why?  I'm sorry.  I was told...  I had some friends at Universal Studios who got to know after we had originally visited  there.  And they said that the topic of conversation was, okay, that guy's either like a drug dealer,  or he's got a lot of money, or he's just really well endowed.  It's one of the three.  Which is not like...  Even though they're saying you shouldn't be with this woman, it's a complimentary thing. 
[03:40:00]  It is a very complimentary thing.  It doesn't get old for you?  You've been married for over 20 years.  You want to be the guy who outkicks his coverage.  You don't want to be the guy where people go, geez, couldn't he have done better than  that?  And I feel like it raises your stock.  Like, people have low expectations.  Okay, there must be something I don't see then.  And my wife really came through when we did Celebrity Wife Swap.  She was great.  Yeah, but that's because she got to hang out with Antonio Sabata Jr. 
[03:40:30]  I mean, most women would be good sports about that, I would think.  But she was very wise, and she was able to talk to Antonio about maybe giving the girl  a little bit more freedom, that you might not need six pages of rules, and she's got  big boobs, so it worked out well for television.  So everything was good.  Speaking of television, and you're putting your family on TV, how do you feel about your  family kind of, you know, wrestling fans and all these people becoming aware of who your  family is, developing opinion, like your daughter. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah.  You know, now she's 19.  Now she's the type of person that guys are going to be looking at.  Right, and then she's got a lot of followers.  I mean, you know, several, you know, a few thousand followers, which is a lot more than  she'd have if she wasn't my daughter.  And I feel funny about it.  Like, you know when she would send me a wonderful tweet, you know, and I'm so proud of her, and  she loves me so much, I still feel very hesitant to put out anything about her.  Because you have mentioned her before.  I have a couple of times.  And I read that tweet, and I go, I don't know if this is a great idea. 
[03:41:30]  A couple of times.  You know, like when she, I think when she went away to college, and I sent a really  nice message to her, and then she sent me something beautiful back, and I just thought,  oh, or when she graduated high school, it was.  Like, if I don't retweet this, you know, I don't want to hurt.  You walk that line between not wanting to hurt anyone's feelings and having people intrude.  But do people, like, then do people start commenting?  Well, you know, yeah, they do.  But it's almost always complimentary.  I've gotten almost all the haters off my site, which apparently is not true with your 
[03:42:00]  You still get some hate mail, right?  Me?  Oh, my God, yes.  It's horrible.  And I can't block everybody, because I still look at the numbers.  Yeah.  Like, the Twitter followers.  And when you block somebody, first of all, I don't know why they're mad at me and following  me, but you can't block everybody.  I saw a great tweet from Andy Richter, and he said, in honor of those who go out of their  way to say they're unfollowing me, I spent the night calling up restaurants to tell them 
[03:42:30]  I wouldn't be dining there.  Mick, this is DJ Who Kid.  Have you ever met DJ Who Kid?  I don't think so.  What's up, man?  You doing okay?  I'm cool, man.  I'm just mad right now.  Why are you mad?  He defeated the Black Hope, man.  I didn't like that.  What do you mean?  He fought Hulk Hogan.  Have you ever wrestled Hulk Hogan?  No, actually, I never did.  No, no.  I could have sworn you had him on a little pressure cooker.  We had a verbal interaction that got intense.  But no, no, I wish I had. 
[03:43:00]  I mean, that's one thing I wish I'd done is wrestle the Hulkster.  Hulk Hogan is not the great Black Hope.  I know.  Black people, they like Mick Foley.  We talked about this before, but they all call him mankind.  They do.  It's a funny thing.  You hate to group anyone by...  Of course.  But I will say, like, as we were just talking about Twitter, people from the Middle Eastern  part of the world tend to be a little more vociferous in wanting you to follow them.  Follow me, please.  Please follow me.  Follow me.  And I know that's true.  Because any time a wrestler mentions me, whether it's you or Punk or Ryder, any time, Michael 
[03:43:30]  Cole, anyone, I always get Middle Eastern tweets saying, follow me, not Sam.  They don't understand that you can't follow.  Yeah.  So that's a Middle Eastern thing.  So I'm lumping them into one huge...  So you got Muslim, like, Twitter followers?  Oh, yeah.  Many.  Muslim or from India would be Hindu.  But when it comes to my, you know, urban audience, that was the biggest thing for me  when I realized that that... 
[03:44:00]  I remember, and this is going to sound so politically incorrect, when I was struggling  in Memphis, Tennessee, one of the top wrestlers there who'd grown up in the South, he goes,  Jacko, I think you're going to make it.  And I said, why is that?  And he goes, because you've got the black audience.  And I said, what does that mean?  And he just said, historically, like, they knew their wrestling better than the...  They, like, had an...  This is such a generalization.  Of course.  But it's...  It's a positive generalization that they were better at spotting, you know, reality and 
[03:44:30]  finding someone that they could, you know...  Oh, that's interesting.  So the promoters would think, as goes the black audience, so goes the general public.  So that within a few years, the white audience will catch on.  That's cool.  That was the idea.  Well, that's true, though, because, I mean, you look at what, like, white kids wear now,  it's what black kids thought was cool, like, a year ago.  Yeah.  I mean, black people tend to be on the cusp.  We're a little late, but he still got the little Rick Ross beard, you know?  I can relate to him, you know? 
[03:45:00]  Yeah.  Big like Rick Ross, you know?  He's a boss?  He's not a rapist.  Are you a rapist?  No!  No!  Not only am I, not...  He's a family man.  I, uh...  Not only am I.  You look like a rapist, though.  No, I hate...  How dare you?  I was actually the RAIN, which is an anti-sexual assault organization.  I was your volunteer of the month two years ago.  Yeah, this is a guy who's gone way out of his way to donate money and to create awareness.  Stop rape.  Stop rape.  For a rape charity called RAIN, Rape Abuse Incest. 
[03:45:30]  Rape Abuse Incest National Network.  Yeah, it's a great charity.  I was talking to a friend of mine from school.  This is not a funny story, but it'll give you an idea.  It's a tough subject, and it's a very pleasant-sounding name.  RAIN, you know?  It sounds so nice.  And then my friend said, oh, and what is that?  I said, I've been volunteering for a group called RAIN.  She goes, well, what does that stand for?  And by the time I got to the third word, I said, rape, abuse, incest...  And there were tears streaming down her face.  Get out of here, girl.  So you do volunteer work, huh? 
[03:46:00]  That's really good of you.  And then about an hour later, she goes, in case you couldn't tell, that hit a little close  to home.  And I said, yeah, yeah, I did.  I couldn't tell a little bit.  So yeah, I did a lot of work.  So I would be the anti-rape guy.  I'd be the furthest thing from that guy.  But who gives the guy to ask the questions?  He's a guy who's like, I don't know.  Yeah.  You know, and that's all I ask.  I'm here to learn, man.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Let me ask you, Mick.  I was wondering today, while all the debauchery was going on on your appearance on the Opie  and Anthony show.  Yes. 
[03:46:30]  Because I also think you've got to be tired of doing the wrestling interviews, because  it kind of gets to be the same questions a lot.  It can be, yeah.  But then in here, I'm like, but he can't be comfortable while they're just literally,  on the Opie and Anthony show, they try to throw whatever they can to make you feel as  uncomfortable as possible.  You know, I thought, I wish I hadn't shared the story about the numbness in my genitals  when I drive long distances and getting pulled over.  Well, you know, your nerves get trapped, in my case. 
[03:47:00]  And then I was like, wait a second, I've lost feeling in my genitals.  Now I'm wishing I didn't tell it, but I'm going to tell it again.  But who kid hasn't heard it?  And so I went, yeah.  Yeah, you just, you lose that sensation if you've done what I did for so long on the  concrete floors.  And while I was reaching to make sure they were still there, I was accelerating on the  gas pedal and got pulled over.  And my explanation for speeding was that I couldn't feel my penis.  That's ill.  And you told that to a police officer. 
[03:47:30]  You told a cop that?  Yeah.  And I explained to him, I said, my nerves are trapped, pinched, and I lost sensation in  my penis.  I wasn't sure it was there.  And I was reaching to reassure myself.  And I accidentally stepped on the gas pedal.  That's the instinct.  I better double check that it even is there.  You can get a ticket for dick paralysis?  No, I think the speeding was the issue.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's the law.  Paralysis, yeah.  I mean, I got pulled over when I called in from, remember when I got locked up?  Well, who kid?  I had ass paralysis. 
[03:48:00]  Like, my asshole.  I couldn't feel it.  I don't know where that comes from.  I mean, you know where you squeeze it?  No, I don't.  I don't, unfortunately.  Let's get out of there.  Let's get out of this subject.  Who kid was pulled over recently, actually?  So you're saying.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Who kid?  I don't know.  We could conceivably have a sexual action that neither one of us would feel.  Right.  Yeah.  Conceivably.  Now, you're not pitching this.  I'm not pitching you this idea.  Because I don't have anything planned for today's show, so if you guys want to shut 
[03:48:30]  the curtains, we'll turn the camera off.  I ain't so bad.  Can you feel this?  No, I got nothing.  Wait, wait.  The feeling's back.  Get it out.  You can't believe Mr. Ball, your ball's deep.  No, I've got nothing.  No, no feeling.  It feels good that at least, you know, a white person is scared when they get pulled  over to by the cops.  We're connected now.  Man.  Yeah.  It's a scary thing.  But who kid was recently pulled over?  Yeah.  For what?  And I go home.  He was on this show, on my show.  I pulled over for being a nigga.  And I don't know if that was the reason. 
[03:49:00]  I wrote a Bob Dylan song.  This is a song about Reuben Hurricane Carter.  And he says, in Patterson, he goes, he pulled over, he goes, I went to where?  He goes, in Patterson, is that just the way it goes?  If you're black, you better not show up in the street unless you want to draw the heat.  Here's the story of the hurricane.  Man, the authorities came to blame for something that he never done.  The problem is...  Stuck in a prison cell, but one time he could have been the champion of the world. 
[03:49:30]  You've been working on that.  Bob Dylan, hurricane.  That's hot.  Who kid, unfortunately, though, he takes that excuse, but he's guilty of everything they  accuse him of.  It's not a racial thing.  He had 13 suspended license, suspensions on his license.  Well, eight.  You can knock five off.  Okay.  Come on, Sam.  Eight suspensions on his license.  So he's doing this show.  I go home, and it's like the afternoon, and all of a sudden, I start getting pictures  tweeted because all the hip-hop blogs have pictures of Who Kid with handcuffs behind  his back getting walked off, you know, in a police car. 
[03:50:00]  I'm like, what's going on?  I'm texting him.  No text back.  And so I talk to a couple of my buddies who are cops and say, you know, can you look  into this?  Can you see what's going on?  And we figure out it was some kind of traffic stop.  So I text Who Kid the next morning, and I go, look, I'm sure you don't have your phone  on you right now, but whenever you get out of jail, if it's before 11 o'clock, call my  show, because I got it.  And he got out.  It's like 1030.  The first call he makes when he gets out of jail.  It's to you.  And it was February 1st.  And Who Kid started that phone call with, happy Black History Month.  I'm out of jail. 
[03:50:30]  It was a traumatizing thing.  I went through Central Booking, and I was bumping that Fandango reeking mixtape in my  car.  You were.  And then that's why I got pulled over, man.  You know, me and him is doing music together.  I got him on a song with Tupac.  Josh Matthews gave DJ Who Kid a shout out on SmackDown.  Oh, you did?  No kidding.  He said Fandango's theme music is played by all these DJs across the country.  Killing that shit.  And he mentioned DJ Who Kid's name.  So I got him on a record with Tupac now.  He's the most gangsters guy in the black community.  So I combined it with a little Spanish little moisture. 
[03:51:00]  Fandango.  I like that.  I noticed, Mick.  Yes.  You've made a fashion choice.  And, you know, you're very known for wearing plaid.  Yeah.  But you came in today, and oh, and I didn't mention this.  You've given up the plaid in favor of a Hawaiian shirt.  It's not just any Hawaiian shirt.  It's a Santa Claus shirt thing.  Oh.  I'm going double Santa today.  You've taken this Santa thing to new levels.  It's not like it used to be with you.  When you go double Santa, you are making a statement.  Yeah.  I like that shirt. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah.  Thank you.  Dude, I've got an extra one of these.  Do you wear this bad, baby?  Wanted, naughty, or nice.  Nice.  St. Mick.  And might as well throw in the plug if you don't mind.  Yeah, please.  Starting June 3rd, we got a Kickstarter for a Santa Claus documentary that I'm part of.  Wow.  It starts June 3rd, and you can get all kinds of, obviously, prizes from a Miss shirt to  an autograph to the big package where you go to WWE, SmackDown taping, Lunch With Me,  all kinds of Santa stuff. 
[03:52:00]  And that's at IamSantaMovie.com starting June 3rd.  It starts on June 3rd.  If that dick, Zach Braff, can make, like, $2 million on Kickstarter, you could throw  Mick Foley something.  Of course.  Yeah.  Maybe give it a mention.  Yeah, I'd be glad to get you one.  If we get to...  Can we get somebody to get my bag in here?  We'll do it on air.  I just gave Jeffrey Tamworth.  I'll wear it for today to the club.  Yeah, yeah.  Somebody's going to get his bag.  Yeah, the Santa thing is a whole new level because you got the double Santa shirt on today.  You get inducted into the Hall of Fame.  Now, I know your wrestling career, obviously, very well, and for a long time, you were sitting 
[03:52:30]  there and you're doing all the crazy stuff and falling on barbed wire boards and jumping  off cages and everything, and you said, when you started doing the silly stuff, that at  one point you were worried that people would remember you as just the guy who pulls a sock  out of his pants.  Now, you've gone so far in the opposite direction that when this moment comes, that the wrestlers  say, when I got inducted into the Hall of Fame, it was my moment.  You see some of these guys, they wear their Hall of Fame ring everywhere. 
[03:53:00]  Who walks out on stage along with Mick Foley in Madison Square Garden, the building where  he saw the match that shaped his career?  Wow.  Snooka Morocco in a cage.  Who walks out on stage to honor Mick Foley?  And I'm sure it was by your request, but Santa Claus.  Santa Claus, yeah.  In the middle of...  And it's April.  The real.  It's kind of kicking right there.  The real Santa Claus.  You can contact him at Santa Claus Way, but here's the deal. 
[03:53:30]  This is a story I'll tell.  It was insane.  There's a story to it, but I went up to Mr. McMahon.  Granted, I'm giving away a little bit of my story here, but I said, you know, Vince, you  know, I never actually had, like, pyrotechnics or any type of fancy exit or entrance in my  career, and he goes, yeah, I understand.  And, you know, this is a really important building to me.  This is where I used to hitchhike to, take trains to, where I saw a snooka jump off the  top of the steel cage.  He goes, yes, I understand. 
[03:54:00]  And I said, well, when I leave the stage, I'd like to ascend into the rafters on a sleigh  with Santa Claus.  That was your pitch?  That was my pitch.  It worked.  And when they wouldn't know and it didn't work, they said, no, we're not going to do  that.  He wanted to get on a sleigh and go up into the bleep.  Go up into the rafters.  And so what I had to do is I had to put Santa on my guest list.  So when the WWE Talent Relations was going, okay, let's have this ticket list, I said,  okay, I need six for Foley as my family was there. 
[03:54:30]  Did Vince tell you?  We're not going to do that.  He said, no, that's not going to happen.  I can't do that.  So I still think the only reason they allowed him to come out at the end is they probably  said, oh, give him what he wants.  God damn it, he brought Santa Claus with him.  So this is what happened.  I had to go to Talent Relations and request a ticket.  So I said, six for Foley, four for Imbriani, childhood friend.  And then I said, I need two for Santa Claus.  And she went, okay, what's his name?  I said, well, it's Santa Claus.  She goes, no, I understand you're bringing Santa Claus. 
[03:55:00]  What's his name?  And I said, it's Santa Claus.  That's his name.  And he legally changed it.  That's crazy.  Wow.  Yeah, he's the real deal, man.  He lives the gimmick, as they say.  So he came out.  He's hardcore.  That's hardcore.  I mean, you talk about hardcore.  When you make that, that's a level of commitment that I respect.  That's crazy.  Yeah, and for people at Santa Claus Way, just check him out or oldmanchristmas.com.  He's the best Santa in the business.  That's amazing.  And they did change your graphics, I noticed. 
[03:55:30]  I don't know if you noticed that, but on the big screen, they had like the,  he comes out and he's talking about his career, and they have the, you know, the happy face  with the Hannibal Lecter Mankind mask on it, and barbed wire and stuff on it to represent  everything he's done.  Santa Claus comes out, and all of a sudden this happy face is wearing a little Santa hat.  It's like, Nick, what does this have to do with your wrestling career?  I didn't even know that.  Last night, I was supposed to be on Artie Lang's show, and Colin Quinn was hosting for him,  and I had actually brought this specialty shirt. 
[03:56:00]  Ooh, that's hard.  Yeah, you smell like beef and cheese, you don't smell like Santa.  What does that mean?  You don't remember Elf?  Uh-uh.  That's where Will Ferrell's like, Santa, I know him, I know him.  And then he walks up, it's Artie Lang with the fang beard.  And Will goes, you don't smell like Santa.  You smell like beef and cheese.  It's a specialty item, let me see.  That's great.  We got an XL, is that going to fit you, my man?  Uh, I go to Europe a lot, and I hang with a lot of, like... 
[03:56:30]  So you're saying you need a shmedium.  I need, like, a large or something.  I can get you that.  Well, just throw it in the dryer for now.  Yeah.  There you go, you can rock that.  I get a bitch to pee on it or something.  Right.  I think if you get a bitch to pee on it, it'll shrink up a little bit.  I think that's on the tag, too.  Yeah.  Now, do I have to let you go to make a flight, or are you going to hang out?  You know what?  I've got to do a little wrestling interview in a few minutes.  I'll miss the flight to hang out with you guys.  Good.  What the heck?  Good, good.  And besides, it's not like...  You're going to be sitting there in that wrestling interview thinking,  Oh, my God. 
[03:57:00]  We were all having such a good time.  What did I do this for?  Just to prove to you that I'm not all Santa all the time.  Here's my other shirt.  Oh, I'm all Santa all the time.  Is this your luggage?  This is what you have to wear.  Look at that.  That actually works.  That's a small XL.  Looking good, man.  Looking good.  And you'll throw that up on your Instagram, right?  Who can...  Like a blood.  Like, I'm going to kill somebody.  I will, man.  Well, can we take a photo that you can then send to me since I don't have a camera?  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  We'll take it after this.  Appreciate it.  There's some bitches from this shit.  All right. 
[03:57:30]  I think you will.  I think you will be able to.  Some Santa hoes in the Pokemon.  All right.  That's right.  That's right.  Mick, you just found out.  What I just found out, I can't believe that you really go to bed watching Christmas stuff.  Do you mean before you go to sleep, you're always watching Christmas movies?  I find it relaxes me either.  My son got me a Kindle Fire for Christmas, and so I can either look up, like, Christmas  stories that I can read, you know, whether it's a classic.  Get out of here. 
[03:58:00]  You know, some of the classics.  The Dickens and...  Does your wife ever go, Mick, Christmas is once a year.  We're done with that.  This is a true story, and I'll mention the young lady's name because she's a, you know,  beautiful young lady.  When I went to the Madison Square Garden to see the Knicks game, the WWE had set me up  in the front row.  You remember seeing me there?  I saw him there.  You didn't.  Sal's a big Knicks fan.  In the front row because we had the Hall of Fame coming up there a month later, and so  this beautiful young lady sits down next to me. 
[03:58:30]  I immediately get insecure thinking, oh, I'm sure she's thrilled to be sitting next to  a guy like me.  And then the Knicks people come over and they start to say, okay, next time out, we're going  to do a little camera shot of you, and then we're going to do an interview at halftime.  And they walked away, and she goes, oh, what do you do?  And I said, well, I wrote a memoir that was pretty popular.  And she goes, oh, what's it about?  And I said, my time in prison.  And then I went back to reading, watching the game.  Then they threw up the wrestling stuff.  And from that point on, I found out she was a rockette. 
[03:59:00]  And if someone wants to follow her, it's Andrea Pincras, I believe.  And as soon as I heard she was a rockette, I was all over her about the Christmas spectacular.  Of course, she would kick it home crazy.  Do you actually get to meet Santa?  So my wife, when I get home, I didn't realize that if you're talking to a beautiful woman  in the front row, you will be seen on camera talking to a beautiful woman in the front row.  And when I got home, my wife was like, how was the game?  I said, it was good. 
[03:59:30]  She goes, it didn't look like you were watching the game.  And I said, what do you mean?  She goes, well, it looked like you were talking to that girl the whole game.  I said, I guess I was.  She said, what were you talking about?  I said, Santa Claus.  She goes, for two hours?  I said, Santa Claus.  She goes, really?  I said, I was talking about Santa Claus.  And at that point, she looked into my eyes, saw my soul, and knew I was speaking the truth.  You're not going to lie about Santa Claus.  If you're doing something you shouldn't be, you're not going to bring Santa Claus into it.  I might go somewhere else.  You don't look like a cheetah, man.  Although you are, you know, you bring up talking to this girl on the game, you are like a shameless 
[04:00:00]  flirt, I feel like.  Because you always are posting pictures of you and the wrestling girls, all your best  friends with all the divas.  And porn stars.  And porn stars.  Yeah.  You're always bringing up Christy Canyon and all your favorite porn stars, and you meet  them.  But you're the nice guy with them.  I am.  Which could be, you know, just like a scumbag move where you're waiting to get them alone.  I'm not.  I've lured you.  I admitted, there's a porn star that has a small child.  I'm very close with the star. 
[04:00:30]  I admitted I had a fantasy about her.  She was like, this is going to be a text.  She was like, what is it?  And I was like, I'd really like to be Santa Claus, you know, for your daughter.  Like, that was what I wanted to do.  Because I could spread joy that way.  And there's not many people who look at her body of work and think, I'd like to dress up  as Santa Claus.  Well, they're usually not thinking I'd like to spread joy as much as, so does your wife  ever say, like, Mick, who do you think you are? 
[04:01:00]  You're just walking around hanging out with hot women all day?  Like, do you have to be friends with every hot woman you meet?  No, she doesn't mind.  Because she knows I worked really hard for the money I have, and I would do about anything  not to give her half of it, you know, like, honestly, you know, you're too cheap to cheat  because it would mean a divorce.  It would cost me a lot.  Yeah, it would cost.  And also, I don't want photos of my, any cheating would eventually involve me being naked in front 
[04:01:30]  of somebody, and I was yesterday completely naked in front of a woman, but she was blind.  How did this happen?  My blind massage therapist, Jessica.  Wow.  Yeah.  And, you know, yeah, no, I'm not kidding.  Like, it took me six months before, and she'd go, Mickey, you know, you can, you know,  you can take off your underwear.  I kept them on, and she'd say, you know, to work the glutes, you need those undies off.  Sure.  And I finally took the underwear off.  Not kidding you.  Yeah, I felt so free, you know, I felt so, so free, but to make sure that she really was 
[04:02:00]  blind and wasn't working it, I walked up to her, and I went, you can't see me, right?  You can't see me.  You can't see me.  No, no, Mick, I can't.  I can't see you.  I can't.  I think that, you know what?  I think the busted open radio guys are calling to me.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I see them pacing outside.  Can I just mention, Caroline's is a big one, June 1st.  So we've got June 6th in Long Island, Edmonton and Calgary, first shows sold out. 
[04:02:30]  Sam, things are going really well.  They're going really well.  Yeah, I heard you talking about, so are you focusing more on the fact that you know that  you have wrestling fans coming to these shows, so you're going to go heavy on the wrestling  stuff?  Definitely.  But I do it in a way where I can, look, if I can work Santa into the equation, when  you can throw Santa Claus and a porn star into a wrestling story, then it makes it interesting  for me.  Right.  So it's not just about, you know, like, for example, I didn't know until I heard Terry 
[04:03:00]  Funk at the Hall of Fame, I didn't know what the Undertaker said to Terry during the Hell  in a Cell match, even though I had seen that Undertaker said something to Terry Funk when  I was on the mat and unconscious.  But what he said, and I'd seen him say something, just never occurred to me to wonder what he  said.  But he went up to Terry and he went, see if he's alive.  And all of a sudden it's like a new, now I've got a new story, now it's not the old  story, now it's Terry Funk coming back and going, he's still breathing.  And that was when the Undertaker chokeslammed Terry and Terry's shoes came off. 
[04:03:30]  Yeah.  He chokeslammed him out of his shoes.  Out of his shoes.  And I have to tell you this, you bring up Terry Funk and it reminds me that we were talking  about people, you know, getting hate messages on Twitter, but I have a lot of supporters  on Twitter.  Of course.  And I was very proud of my fans because you put out this tweet before you were getting  into the Hall of Fame.  And by the way, last time we spoke, if you remember, you and I were doing an interview  and that's where you started your own rumor that you would like to be inducted in.  Oh yeah, I did start that rumor.  Yes, but you send out to your Twitter followers, who do you think should induct me into the 
[04:04:00]  Hall of Fame?  Yeah.  And I didn't know you had tweeted that out until I started reading my app mentions from  all the people that were tweeting you going, obviously it should be not Sam inducting you  into the Hall of Fame.  And I'm sitting there, I might have a chance at this.  Considering the firestorm of, I don't want to say hatred, but anger that Maria Menounos got  inducting back on.  Oh wow.  And she was such a nice person, but I think she went a little too long. 
[04:04:30]  And I think that the fans there.  She wouldn't stop.  Yeah.  Because she got booed.  Because the fans decided, we're going to boo anybody who's not a wrestler.  Oh shit.  And so she comes out and they started booing her.  And she, instead of in her head going, I'm going to cut this short, she was like, you  know what?  I'm going to be a survivor here.  I'm going to do what I plan to do.  And she did this long induction for Bob Backlund and just got destroyed.  And then Bob came out and the first thing he did was took off his jacket.  I was asked, I'll close with this before I do busted open. 
[04:05:00]  I was asked, like, what Hall of Fame induction speech was I looking forward to the most?  And I said, you know, I remember wrestling this guy named Rotten Ron Starr in Alabama.  And he was his old grizzled veteran with scars all over his face.  And not a well-known guy.  But the first guy took me all over the arena brawling.  So I learned a lot from him.  And when I watched the video back at Continental Championship Wrestling, the announcer went,  this one could go anywhere.  It could go anywhere.  And I said, that's why I'm looking forward to Bob Backlund's speech.  Because this one could go anywhere. 
[04:05:30]  And it did.  It went everywhere.  Listen, I've got to run.  But if you guys want to check out, like I said, Edmonton, Calgary, New York, Long Island,  Dayton, Cincinnati, a whole bunch of places, Atlanta, realmcfoley.com, and click on events,  it will be better than you're expecting.  And I will be at Caroline's next Sunday.  Maybe playing the most pivotal role of your career.  This is going to be huge.  All right, it's going to be huge, brother.  Well, thank you, Mick.
