[08:30]
 people talk about how great howard stern is  so now my interest is p  and they go on to say that uh...  stern got somebody to carry a phone  into a best act of me  not only did they  listen to the fact that he put it carried out  a piece of scrotum  and then stern supposedly  had someone eat the scrotum  on the air  for ticket on car  i'm here  they are sick those hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours  i'm looking at the local executive 
[09:00]
 i can i say what you're talking about  but we talk about the same thing we've got the whole story again  and i have to advise them that it was not howard stern  it was a whole piece and anthony  this is what we're up against  they did not know  the only third of stuff like that  no wonder he's got nine shares that's it  and i'm going to have  i don't think people  uh... i don't think howard needs any help at this point there  they don't know they could all be involved 
[09:30]
 if it is one of our beds and you can tell someone else about it please get  our names right  what's the matter  trust me we need the help at this point i thought what you got to give you guys  listen if you think started on it  with the baby's guy  and anthony writes one of the  songs of all time the hey masturbator song that's on our demand world cd  and uh... there's emails going all over the country saying that adam samuel  for a bit of a bit of a bit  when i had to break anywhere  well where a uh... helping out other people with their careers right from 
[10:00]
 margaret all  uh... it's a lot of making all you lawyers know  uh...  hey what do you think your friend uh... eric nyberg  i don't want to go into it  come on any fishes lawyer you know that guy it's a disgrace it is a disgrace  right  uh... you think you cop the feel off of a car he did what it is obvious  uh...  important that is so obvious to everyone remember in court when when they'd be  standing there and she'd have her head tucked in what is that the shoulder and 
[10:30]
 he'd be stroking her hair  yes it's okay baby  meet me back in my office  jim dirty girl  jerry jerry girl aren't you  you know this is cases that are exchange between clients of lawyers all the time  but i have to admit every time i ever saw this guy looking at that particular  client he was looking down her shirt uh...  suspect that well she was one of the more harder felons we've had  and i don't know anymore and i know that that cold-ass stare yes is a mess she 
[11:00]
 kinda look cute though in the little hot pants as i remember her being arrested  with the hot pants and handcuffs as he just hardened you think you should be  out of prison at this point  uh... letters  and let us know what we're actually present given she's done six years there  are people that murder uh... people that uh... are out of prison are so we're  going to write it at night like  uh... not really if it was a guy  uh... would you want to let him out and i'm just saying at this point fair is 
[11:30]
 fair is if if you're allowing uh... murderers out uh... it after you know  less than six years and why she still in prison that's all i'm saying well you  know that it's it's the penal code that's all screwed up here you know it's  it's it's not that i don't agree with the court bill the leg thing how do i get  in the field for meals well you guys are you got to figure out if it's legal  first of all  flesh is flesh like  okay  all right as we go forward with this feels from meals that i'm liking the  concept uh... i like the concept what i think you should invite the mayor to be 
[12:00]
 the first one  uh...  uh...  is a big little son is is chris farley sunday  well  now we don't have a good track record with mayor so will be avoiding him at  all costs i'd like to kick off  nineteen ninety eight  feels from meals  i can see that happened to the america out of cup to feel  elitrop dead yeah i picked up at the station article we got a fly but by you 
[12:30]
 to back thanks a lot of that  all be let now that  amy fisher i think guys that are in there for  for selling weed ought to be let out first well sure  guys are doing like life for selling pot well obviously the whole system is  screwed up yeah but you're ready to let me out what if she was some guy  with instead of the way i like what if it's the same crime but it's like  tyrone williams you know say let him out all the way let him out this point  because i don't think any measures hot anymore 
[13:00]
 doesn't matter that's the you know that's what you're going to have to know  what i'm going to have a she's not hot anymore i just think that if you're  going to let murderers out  uh... that don't even serve you know six years and then why she and that's all  i think the whole system should be looked at if you really want to get into a  discussion i think it's ridiculous i think she's best kept behind bars  they're the truth of the net well it's a lot of people walk in the street that  should be behind bars and that but they let out  that's all i'm saying okay  uh... we're going to be talking to someone that is just absolutely sick 
[13:30]
 six six six she might have the sickest job in the entire country  if that if that's not a good radio t-zone or else say but  what is that the w any double you know i could be a decree what's this life for  from my own present if you're looking for something different and you haven't  checked out the whole creed cd yet we're playing uh... i think three tracks here  and any doubly it's a really really good cd very very good  right well of the we are soliciting uh... girls 
[14:00]
 to help us out with our charity feels for meals  we're offering uh... a girl  in a box  for a dollar  you get to reach in  and uh...  one one little  for a dollar yet  and all the money we raise will go to feed  the hungry  around the holidays yes so i think it's a good cause and it's a good charity  and it's good way to raise money cuz everybody leaves happy well the guys are 
[14:30]
 completely into it and there's a bunch of girls that have been calling and  saying they would line up for charity and and reach into the box as well  right and we got a girl stand by that wants to be the girl in the box alright  i said to me i hear you'll get in the box yet i will  uh... what kind of body have  uh... my measurements are thirty eight  about a thirty about out  thirty eight forty weight hip after the thirty eight doesn't really matter  what kind of cup size uh... on the verge of a d 
[15:00]
 uh... philly c  that can be good  and you would mind hanging out in the box and letting guys you know fill you up  extra part-time so  are really here  and all this money raised will go to a great cause  i would make feeding that the needy this holiday season that great and it's just  one squeeze per dollar that  you think you're a breast kid to hold up i think so  uh...  would be offered to ten thousand squeezes  had finally made 
[15:30]
 uh... and then you're right  we can ever come down here and we'll have a couple of guys go through a test  run  yeah where are you know i will tell you right now that i work at the hospital  and a date  are you are close to fifty seven seven oh no  well i mean queen now  well we gotta get you down here maybe have a real in the bus the guys you know  would give a test feel make sure you were there okay i'm serious  with the fact of the uh... although i don't know  she looks totally into it  you can just tell she would definitely do it 
[16:00]
 forty-hips to  that's why the box  baby got back that's why the box setup you can't piss her off he's on hold  listening to us  and we'll take any girl right now to have to come back there is there not  coming out of the woodwork here at the time i think i think that we can take  yet  i'll i'll take a crack or at this point we need to raise the money for charity  refrigerate about it  shut up  you know why should i have a right side by side and you know and you know it 
[16:30]

[27:30]
 yes it is right  in the latest issue of action magazine with uh... what's your name on the cover  who's on the cover of some unprepared here  yeah yes mean bleep has been okay inside  he does a whole article on people that have very strange jobs in america  and as a guy that like takes gophers out of holes in the midwest and cute little  jobs  and there was one that in interested us a lady kathy joe that has a company  called crime scene steam and clean  we leave the scene clean and pristine what this lady does for her job 
[28:00]
 she goes to uh...  you know crime scenes where people kill themselves or murder someone else or  whatever  and uh... the corner they usually just take the body away and maybe some of the  big pieces  and and they leave you your house in a complete mess mess what and got sent  and uh... skull fragments whatever now who's gonna clean that up i never thought  about who goes in and cleans it up remember pole fiction  you know how much blood is in a person here and if they'd 
[28:30]
 lead out yet all over your rod  who you're gonna call i was thought maybe the corner clean it up now they just  take the body when they move on  this lady kathy joe has this company crime scene steam and clean and she goes  in  as a car takes a body out  and she  cleans up the scene  look at some of this  d comp cleaning only without fogging or dumb three hours to people cleaning  eight hundred bucks  and then they have 
[29:00]
 four to five hours to people cleaning eight hundred that's with dumping  the comp  i have a body's been just laying around for a long  i like the price differential  between shotgun and small gun  it's like twice the price for shotgun  to clean up a shotgun murder or  or suicide  but we got to talk to this girl i am getting so skewed down for the we're  going to talk to kathy joe just a bit here and see what she's all about how she  got into it and if she enjoys her job 
[29:30]
 uh... yeah i'm i'm gonna lose it  so he'd be gb so they're going to have that to look forward to on their right  home but the strength of the  and we're getting a ton of request for the special olympic song so we might as  well do it here  we had our bar new pal steven lynch and last friday  he was a huge huge hits  everyone's emailing him at posse that a well dot com p u s  head at a well dot com  and uh...  this was a song that he told us about off-mic and we said you just got to do 
[30:00]
 it for our showings did i don't know man this is way out there and we've  basically forced him  to do a special olympic song on our show last friday  i didn't think that the joseph holden standing by right will talk to the lady  that owns  the company crime scene steam and clean you're not gonna believe this one  iraq and new york one of these seven w any w it's open at the don't forget  later on tonight right here on any w at ten o'clock we have to let me cry this

[31:00]
 that some people have been kathy joe cleans crime scenes  because in essence uh... the the cops and everybody just take out the bulk of  it the body and leave the  blood all over the place in pieces  and uh... you need somebody going there and clean up never thought about that  you're not gonna want to go in there and clean up somebody you know so you hire  people  and and and and engrossed out already and uh... we haven't talked to her yet  but i was so i think that the joe  her company is called crime scene steam and clean 
[31:30]
 kathy joe  uh... how are you  i think you  i cannot believe uh... what you do for a living  and pretty good sometimes and sometimes i i would say all the time  now how did you get into this  uh... a friend of mine to cargo had a friend who uh... killed himself with a  shotgun very very badly  and they took the body away to the debate  what do you mean you don't clean it up  and uh... he my friend called me and uh... i went back to help out and i  started looking around and found out that at the time which was about four 
[32:00]
 years ago  nobody was doing anything  it's not the kind of jobs you would just want to jump into  now so this is your own business yeah  and uh... i guess you're making money at this  yeah we we've been pretty good  how much like you clear in a year  so we could you know we can talk between you know i would say forty and sixty  that's not bad  now how many jobs you get a year of issue with really good at that i just  did  i want this morning and that was number like eighty for the year and what was it  for was there 
[32:30]
 it was a shotgun suicide  and all right so you show up at the house and what do you do you find  uh...  lots of different pieces they take all the big things they just sort of leave  all the little stuff for us to look on my own so where do you start  that's always the question  you think that they could you look at it go all right now where do i start  uh... usually we've got the first quarter to work our way out of the  like you know i think that we're going to get back at  uh... yeah i see you're on your price list that the shotgun rate 
[33:00]
 is uh... double the small gun rate  that had been usually take that well today we have three people but usually  two people in anywhere between uh... sixty eight hours usually  every bit of data that the people  and uh... the com  there would be doing a detailed  well we have excellent that we were  it's not all that that uh... all yet it's really it's really that  and that they have you believe the only way they can get rid of the call me i  think people  almost literally tear down their homes try to get rid of it 
[33:30]
 and how do you get rid of it  i would like to take the credit all all all all all all  x-ray on the uh...  you bet  is it true that when some of these people kill themselves you find pieces  of a man three or four different rooms all yeah i would have to take the  absolutely  he had a good it really is a picnic  point dot  now this is the business that time of the year for this  yeah yeah really uh... from usually from thanksgiving until after tax time 
[34:00]
 it's uh...  i don't think but it's true  do you go to work is hoping the phones gonna ring with the job  you never know when that when that when you get the call it back to after we  get the check of the morning i got another call for a job i think i think  back over the weekend  but we could get a couple in a row and i go for a week  without getting any  never know you just never know what is the sickest scene you uh... you cleaned  up there was one job that really stand out because  at the end of that happened it with the actual that but it was a key count the  body that there for a while 
[34:30]
 and it happened  a year ago august and they called me off all of all of the year later  to clean it up  they've locked it down for over a year  not before they would put an end and that was on the third floor apartment  building of a very nice flaky place that is  i like that a lot of uh... and we took out over  over two-tons of  crap and that's why  uh... in the whole apartment complex now  what do you think i mean i i would have thought it would have been it would have  and i can't imagine how the other kind of put up with it but apparently 
[35:00]
 nobody cared  where do you take this  john gaffney's unrepentant well in california of we have a lot here that  company like my health health to pass  that makes up the biohazardous material that we take out of their because covered  with blood  and body fluid  it considered medical waste and it has to go to a bird site it's actually  considered a biohazard  which is really  the reason one of the reason they hire company like my back to make the best  away  because it really is a a period health hazards  but you come to some of these locations and and it's dark and you like all men i 
[35:30]
 got a you know open up the window or or put up the blinds and then you realize  this just millions of flies on the window  yeah i've actually  one of the  i think that the company you know what about it but there for a while that part  of the natural process and uh...  i've got to  like eight bags of fly back to window  uh...  it was really bad  all-time  and you don't have to take a look at it  you know when you've got one of the five-pronged 
[36:00]
 and that's it  now you're looking at l a m assuming that you did some high-profile cases  and we've got a few  any that you can hand towards  no  so i  really we can try to be the three that we had we've had jobs where  the other reporters for  hiding in the bushes the telephoto lenses and there's a lot of copies of  it and that kind of that but we try to keep a local program and our clients are  usually  obviously  that  and phil hartman  they don't know they have to get that 
[36:30]
 phil hartman  we try not to we don't we don't talk about it  phil hartman  back at it  uh... i mean yes  uh... means yes i'm missing was it  yes i think i don't know that that company no comment on cclyd up to a  part of it  uh... all right now i'm happy  quite a lot we don't get a lot of repeated but we do try to honor that you  know that  tell your friends that they have  do you ever get so sick of the job that you just couldn't do it 
[37:00]
 well you know what i think that this is the idea that there was no job we  wouldn't do it if the question of how much it would cost  but there have been picked up where we have sort of a rule that if you talk that  you have to create a self-acquired  i think that the couple of that  and i've got a couple where i almost blocked out really have  i was at  and yet you have nightmares and  uh... actually there have been a couple that i  and i'm not making it up now i used to be my cat's raw liver  who took a look at it 
[37:30]
 i don't do that anymore i can imagine that there were a couple of times that i  had  the real thing there have been a few that i  i'd like to wait  at night going to  and i don't get in like he doubt  i thought i got i can't continue this by you know  now you know  when you date somebody to tell me what you do  well i i try not to bring it up first thing  yeah i love that's a good good rule of thumb there and actually you know i need  a lot of cops in corners 
[38:00]
 uh... yes i don't care yeah  you know i'm used to it  yeah alright let's some job you got  what's your next job do you know yet or  uh... well we'll probably have that the couple for the weekend  i can't wait on the end  excited  a little o t  and weekend  yeah well you can get a little extra for the weekend  never do cars like trunks or anything  yeah i have that kind of not a truck but i've got car yeah i don't like to do  that might  prior courage people to just track it but sometimes they wanted they want to try 
[38:30]
 and pay that but is it like the scene at a pulp fiction you see that oh yeah  yet very much  and i got a clean the guy's face off the back window and yeah  yet very much like that  all my lord  i swear to god i don't know what to say i'm like i'm so grossed out  but you can imagine having to try to clean up a culture of your  uh...  car  yeti ever think about these people as humans are anything like picking up  parts of this government  all yeah really but you know what it is that we go to pay to be happy to go 
[39:00]
 through we have to go through all the personal property  and you think that they would want their mother to know about that  all really that you really get to know you people have a very intimate level  what was the wildest thing you saw  in that regard  that that that that that that that that uh... or no uh... film that that  well there was the kind of we did that with my bag when we clean it up that was  kind of weird to wasn't read yeah  but i don't know  that will be in the blue is that all  can i get a little out of our acting 
[39:30]
 yeah always strangled himself with death  and you're going to put up with those what he was there for a couple days  and  that was kind of that was kind of strange  how embarrassing not only going like that but you're in a dress you know exactly  i think that was the other that that felt really bad for i mean his  grandmother was our client i felt really bad for her we cleaned up all of that  stuff so  he didn't have to deal with that before you know  i mean that was  that was a terrible for her  you're talking about this like you know you're discussing a soap opera it's 
[40:00]
 like no big deal to you  well it is a big deal i mean each case is different everybody is a human being i  mean you do you think you do understand that yeah and uh... empathizing with our  client is a big part of the business i think we have to be here a lot of that  but they always want to get  they don't want to tell you about whoever you cleaning up and  how do you clean up  he was a good guy could you get that spot  well they think i you know i'm back i was such a rotten person i really glad  you know i read it by the people pay you all kinds of stuff  when you leave in the uh... the jobsite you look at each other over and go hey 
[40:30]
 you got a little bob on your cheese  no i don't know  we pretty careful about that kind of thing  alright kathy johan will let you go okay  now this has been uh...  quite experience well thanks for calling thank you okay alright bye bye  uh...  nightmares  and  the  back into the  i think it's safer that way

[44:00]

[45:30]

[47:00]
 well we're trying to look for a girl that has uh...  some sturdy boobs  there's gonna be a lot of squeezing going on here  uh... basically the girl gets in the boxes topless right  uh... site on scene  not if you don't want to show face okay  you know and then the guys in the girls line up  and that they and i were like that the pitch men we sit there with a hat  you'd you'd give us a dollar  and then the guy or the girl you know steps up to the box will be a couple  holes in the box  they reach in  and they'd be reach around for your breast and they get one quick squeeze 
[47:30]
 and if they squeeze more than that then we beat the hell out of them will have a  couple of houses on hand  okay and that's it and then it's the next person but this could go on for  hours brain  and what are you doing there  uh... hopefully in within the next week we got a raise money for the the  homeless this holiday season right  that's why it that's why it's called feels for meals we're gonna feed a lot  of homeless people this holiday season  it's a very good class  okay now how tall are you  uh... five foot three  five three uh... weight
