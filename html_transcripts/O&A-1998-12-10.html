<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a chaotic account of their rushed morning, including a hurried start and a meeting with their boss.  They announced plans to replay some older segments: "Pork Man," a Furby prank call, and "I Stole Stuff from the Hotel," but decided against replaying a segment where Opie told a child Santa Claus wasn't real. A sponsorship for "Cigars Around the World" followed, during which Anthony accidentally cut himself with a cigar cutter.

The hosts then heavily promoted their "Feels for Meals" charity event, a fundraiser involving topless women in boxes, charging people a dollar for a "feel."  They actively recruited women via phone calls.  A call with their "unofficial lawyer" highlighted the frequent confusion between their stunts and Howard Stern's.  The conversation drifted to Amy Fisher and her lawyer's perceived conduct during her trial.  They continued soliciting women for "Feels for Meals," interviewing Stephanie, a part-time stripper.  Anthonyâ€™s comments offended Stephanie, causing a tense exchange.

A male caller then recounted his experience joining their "Tuesday Night Hummer Club."  They reconnected with Stephanie, who clarified details about her appearance.  Opie made several crude and offensive comments comparing her to a "retarded version" of Jennifer Lopez.  The conversation devolved into discussions of strip clubs and the hosts' first experiences in such establishments.

A dispute between Opie and Anthony followed over who originally made a joke about Patrick Swayze's brother.  An advertisement for MindSpring internet service aired, leading into a preview of an interview with Kathy Jo, owner of "Crime Scene Steam and Clean."  This interview detailed her gruesome experiences cleaning up crime scenes, including a shotgun suicide and a decomposed body, eliciting visceral reactions from Opie.

The show concluded with further discussion of "Feels for Meals" and another potential participant, Terry.  Finally, they announced the next day's segment, "FU Friday," where listeners could anonymously submit requests for the hosts to deliver harsh, honest messages to people with various flaws (bad breath, poor toupees, outdated clothing, etc.), via email (opack@WNEW.com) or fax (212-957-WNEW).  They mentioned plans for women to test their breast firmness as part of the "Feels for Meals" fundraiser the following day.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  1027 WNEW, the rock of New York.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  Hello, hello, hello.  Hey there.  Hey man.  Let's make believe we've been in the studio the whole time.  For hours.  Look, I'm still getting all my stuff together here.  We just had like a meeting.  Radio guys aren't supposed to have meetings, are they?  No, this is all fun.  Yeah, I mean, to the listener, it's just a bunch of guys that come in and play some tunes. 
[00:00:30]  And that's it.  No.  We had meetings and all sorts of stuff going on.  We've got to hash things over with the boss.  I walked in the studio.  There was 30 seconds left on the Pink Floyd song.  I didn't even have my headphones plugged in or anything.  I was in the bathroom.  I noticed.  Making a...  Leaky.  All right, we're here.  We better just take a break, I think.  Yeah, let's...  We've worked too much already.  Oh, yeah.  We better take a break. 
[00:01:00]  Regroup.  What are we even doing today?  Oh, my God.  What a mess.  What a mess is right.  Okay.  I don't even know what we're doing yet.  Usually we're in our little office and we sit there and we discuss the show and we write  down things we want to talk about.  And then we come in here and we get our coffee set and we get comfortable.  Anthony plugs in his computer.  Yeah.  We check out a few tunes with you guys and then we get on the air and we're ready to  go.  Well focused and knowing the path we're going to take. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  Well...  Today, we're off the road.  That's okay.  We'll get right back on.  Yeah.  We'll regroup here.  All right.  All right.  Well, the fax line, 212-957-WNEW.  Request line, 212-757-1027.  What I can tell you, we will be replaying the Pork Man today.  Who sung his lovely Christmas carol yesterday.  Brand new call from the Furby police.  That was very good.  We're going to do.  People enjoyed the I Stole Stuff from the Hotel prank call. 
[00:02:00]  I like that.  Yes.  Okay.  And the Santa thing is not going to happen today, Anthony.  No.  We just can't do that.  You'll wreck me as a human being.  You will wreck me as a human being.  Well, it's known that Opie is the crueler of the two of us.  What?  The more insensitive.  I think he goes off half cocked sometimes.  But who's actually crueler when you're, you know, replaying all these bits that people just did not enjoy in the past? 
[00:02:30]  Why would we replay them now?  He's trying to show people the type of person you are.  But you're a crueler for replaying them.  There's a tape of Opie telling a small child that there is no S-A-N-T-A. 
[00:03:00]  You know what I mean?  It happened a long time ago.  The poor kid.  Now that guy is a president of a company.  He's grown up and he has kids of his own now.  Oh, yeah.  All in a year and a half.  Oh, shut up, man.  Or two years, maybe.  You will wreck me as a human being if you're allowed to play that.  Well, I have it.  Maybe we'll do that.  Can you?  Can you?  You are repeating yourself, dear.  Good taste echoes from the canyon.  Canyon, canyon.  Corbett Canyon. 
[00:03:30]  Corbett Canyon Vingles.  I'm Wilson Dispo and everybody, California.  Anthony, cigars around the world, huh?  My goodness, look at this.  It just brought us in a little package.  I'm looking at a nice bag of cigars and a cigar cutter.  I'm pretty psyched.  Is this what you get when you call cigars around the world?  You get the cigars and the cigar cutter and the newsletter?  Yeah.  Anthony, smell that cigar.  Smell it.  Whoa, you know what this is?  Huh?  A Maker's Mark cigar. 
[00:04:00]  Bourbon seasoned cigar.  You know who drinks Maker's Mark?  No.  Lemmy from Motorhead.  Swear to God.  Did a show with Lemmy once in the city.  Yeah.  And he was drinking Maker's Mark and my guitarist, Rex, thought he could go shot for shot with him.  Lemmy did the show.  Our guitarist did not.  Wow, I didn't know Maker's Mark made a cigar.  This is the kind of stuff you get with cigars around the world.  Yes, for only $24.95 per month, plus shipping, cigars around the world sends five fresh hand-rolled cigars, 
[00:04:30]  a smoking newsletter, free cigar cutter, a gift card, and more.  And what's cool, they've got two to 12-month memberships.  They're available by just calling 1-800-FRESH-66.  How does this cigar cutter work?  You put the...  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Just kidding, of course.  Give them a call.  Cigars around the world.  1-800-FRESH-66.  Okay.  1027 WNEW. 
[00:05:00]  The Rock of New York with the police.  Life Merle Jam before that daughter.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hope you're enjoying your afternoon.  A lot of people faxed in an email about our Feels for Meals program, Anthony.  Oh, yes.  Very important thing around the holiday season.  Feeding people that are going hungry.  Yes.  A lot of people don't...  They don't get the turkey and ham and everything and have a nice Christmas dinner.  So we're doing something a little out of character for us, I think. 
[00:05:30]  A lot of people...  Oh, I see.  Okay, sorry.  I mean, as far as being charitable.  Yes.  Not a lot of people know about our charitable exploits.  We're quite the philanthropists, me and Opie.  Well, yeah.  We've raised a lot of money for charities.  Yes, yes.  And our Demanded World CD raised a ton of money for the homeless veterans.  Homeless veterans, yes.  They got more money than we did for our CD.  That's for sure.  I think everybody did.  So when we, like, push our CD on the air, Opie and Anthony's Demanded World, it's not because we're going to make a buck off this thing. 
[00:06:00]  We're just proud of the CD and want you to possess it.  And Manuel, who put the plastic wrap on it at the factory, made more per CD than we did.  Swear to God.  So, yes, we're very charitable, of course.  So we saw some people, heard about them, hungry.  We felt we should do something for the holiday season.  So we came up with Feels for Meals.  Feels for Meals.  A very simple concept. 
[00:06:30]  Rick, how many girls do we have interested?  Three.  Did you call them back today?  Yes.  Uh-oh.  That doesn't sound good.  Uh-oh.  He's shaking his head.  We might need to recruit more women.  It's a very simple concept.  We're going to get a few refrigerator boxes, I guess, right?  Yeah.  We're going to put a topless girl in the box.  Uh-huh.  We're going to cut out some holes.  All right?  And then the guys and the girls line up with their dollars.  They hand a dollar to Anthony and I.  And then they step forward. 
[00:07:00]  And they reach into the box.  And...  Oh, that's two bucks.  That's two bucks.  One feel per buck.  There you go.  And then the person moves on.  Right.  And all money raised, we will feed the hungry this holiday season.  It's Feels for Meals.  Feels for Meals.  You get a feel and we, you know, get food to the needy.  Everyone wins.  Yeah.  Everyone wins with something like this.  Uh-huh.  And I believe it is tax deductible. 
[00:07:30]  Well, you can write off your dollars.  I got a message on my voicemail from a stockbroker.  He says he made an S-load this year.  And he needs a write-off.  So he wants to come down with about $1,000.  A thousand feels.  We can raise so much money.  Oh, yeah.  I think a few of the ladies have backed out.  So if you're a fine young woman or an older woman, I don't care what type of woman you are.  Want to help out?  Yes.  You want to help out our show and help out the needy, give us a call.  Rick will screen the calls and see if you're worthy. 
[00:08:00]  Donate your boobs for charity.  Sure.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Okay?  Mm-hmm.  We got legal counsel Paul on the phone here.  What does he have?  He's our unofficial lawyer, I think, for our show.  Yeah.  Hey, Paul.  Paulie.  Hey.  What do you got, man?  How are you guys doing?  Good.  You know, I have to tell you, a little thing happened to me yesterday.  All right.  I'm on a plane coming back from Washington after days in business, and I overhear this  conversation. 
[00:08:30]  People are talking about how great Howard Stern is.  So now my interest is peaked.  And they go on to say that Stern got somebody to carry a phone into a vasectomy.  Not only did they listen in on the vasectomy, but he carried out a piece of scrotum.  And then Stern supposedly had someone eat the scrotum on the air for tickets.  Oh, come on.  I'm serious.  They honestly thought it was Howard Stern that did that?  They honestly thought it was Howard Stern.  So I'm looking at him. 
[00:09:00]  So I walk around and say, excuse me, I couldn't understand what you're talking about.  Are we talking about the same thing?  We'd go through the whole story again, and I have to advise them that it was not Howard  Stern.  It was Opie and Anthony.  Oh, this is what we're up against.  They said, no, no.  Only Stern does stuff like that.  No wonder he's got nine shares.  Yeah.  And we got a point, too.  Yeah.  I don't think people, I don't think Howard needs any help at this point.  Yeah.  They didn't know.  They said, Opie and who?  Oh, if it is one of our bits and you're going to tell someone else about it, please get 
[00:09:30]  our names right and what station you heard it on.  Trust me, we need the help at this point.  Well, I told them, you've got to give these guys a listen.  If you think Stern is on it, listen to these guys.  And Anthony writes one of the best group songs of all time, the Hey, Masturbator song that's  on our Dementor World CD.  And there's emails going all over the country saying that Adam Sandler wrote it.  We can't catch a break anywhere.  Wow.  We're helping out other people with their careers. 
[00:10:00]  Right.  From our deep hole.  Huh?  Is there a lawsuit in the making?  Oh, you lawyers.  No.  Oh, God.  No.  Hey, what do you think of your friend Eric Nyberg?  Oh, I don't want to go and do it.  Come on.  Amy Fisher's lawyer.  You know that guy?  It's a disgrace.  It is a disgrace, right?  You think he copped the feel off of her?  Oh, come on.  He didn't want a net.  It's obvious, huh?  He didn't want a net.  It is so obvious to everyone.  Remember in court when they'd be standing there and she'd have her head tucked in his shoulder 
[00:10:30]  and he'd be stroking her hair?  Yes, it's okay, baby.  You meet me back in my office?  You're a dirty girl.  You're a dirty girl, aren't you?  You know, there's gazes that are exchanged between clients and lawyers all the time.  But I have to admit, every time I ever saw this guy looking at that particular client,  he was looking down her shirt.  It's just a bad, bad thing.  Well, she was one of the more hotter felons we've had in New York.  Not anymore.  Now she's got that cold-ass stare. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, she's a mess.  She kind of looked cute, though, in the little hot pants, as I remember her being arrested  with the hot pants and the handcuffs.  Now she's just hardened.  You think she should be out of prison at this point?  Nah, let her sit.  Why?  Let her sit.  She's probably got a lot more action in prison.  Yeah, but she's done six years.  There are people that murder people that are out of prison.  All right, so we're going to let her out.  That's not right either.  She has nice legs.  Yeah, really.  If it was a guy, would you want to let him out?  I'm just saying, at this point, fair is fair. 
[00:11:30]  If you're allowing murderers out after less than six years, then why is she still in prison?  That's all I'm saying.  Well, it's the penal code that's all screwed up here.  It's not that.  I don't agree with the...  Going along towards the legs thing, how do I get in the fields for meals?  Well, you've got to figure out if it's legal, first of all, Paul.  Hey, flesh is flesh, my friend.  Okay.  All right, because we're going to go forward with this fields for meals thing.  I'm liking the concept.  I like the concept, but I think you should invite the mayor to be the first one. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, that'll help us out.  Don't bring his son.  His little...  His big little son.  His Chris Farley son?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, no, we don't have a good track record with mayor, so we'll be avoiding him at all costs.  No.  I'd like to kick off 1998's Fields for Meals.  Yeah, I can't see that happening.  He can say, oh, the mayor caught a cup to feel.  Oh, he dropped dead.  Yeah.  All right.  He kicked off of this station.  All right, Paul, we've got to fly.  Bye-bye. 
[00:12:30]  You too.  Bye.  Thanks a lot, man, for that.  Thanks.  Bye.  Opie letting out Amy Fisher.  I think guys that are in there for selling weed ought to be let out first.  Well, sure.  Guys that are doing, like, life for selling pot.  Well, obviously, the whole system is screwed up.  Yeah, but you're ready to let Amy out.  What if she was some guy?  What if instead of Amy...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  What if it's the same crime, but it's like Tyrone Williams?  You're going to say, let him out, Opie?  Let him out at this point.  Because I don't think Amy Fisher is hot anymore. 
[00:13:00]  Doesn't matter.  Well, because that's the, you know, that's what you were going with.  Yeah, that's kind of what I'm going with.  Yeah, but she's not hot anymore.  I just think that if you're going to let murderers out that don't even serve, you know, six years,  then why is she in there?  That's all.  I think the whole system should be looked at if you really want to get into a discussion.  I think it's ridiculous.  I think she's best kept behind bars, to tell you the truth.  Well, there's a lot of people walking the street that should be behind bars.  Yeah.  But they let out.  That's all I'm saying.  Okay.  We're going to be talking to someone that is just absolutely sick. 
[00:13:30]  Sick, sick, sick.  She might have the sickest job in the entire country ever.  If that's not a good radio tease, I don't know what else to say, but stick around.  102.7 WNEW, The Rock of New York, Creed.  What's this life for?  From my own prison.  If you're looking for something different and you haven't checked out the whole Creed CD yet,  we're playing, I think, three tracks here at NEW.  It's a really, really good CD.  Very, very good.  All right.  Well, Opie, we are soliciting girls to help us out with our charity, Feels for Meals. 
[00:14:00]  We're offering a girl in a box, nude, for a dollar.  You get to reach in and feel.  Right.  One little beep for a dollar.  Yeah.  And all the money we raise will go to feed the hungry around the holidays.  Yes.  So I think it's a good cause and it's a good charity and it's a good way to raise money because 
[00:14:30]  everybody leaves happy.  Well, the guys are completely into it.  And there's a bunch of girls that have been calling and saying they would line up for charity  and reach into the box as well.  That's right.  And we got a girl standing by that wants to be the girl in the box.  All right.  Hi, Stephanie.  I hear you'll get in the box.  Yes, I will.  What kind of body do you have?  My measurements are 38 to about a 30, about a 38, 40 weight hip.  After the 38, it doesn't really matter.  What kind of cup size? 
[00:15:00]  I'm on the verge of a D, but I'm still a C.  That can be good.  Uh-huh.  And you wouldn't mind hanging out in a box and letting guys, you know, fill you up?  I strip part-time, so.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And all this money raised will go to a great cause.  Fine with me.  Feeding the needy this holiday season.  That's great.  And it's just one squeeze per dollar.  Yeah.  Okay.  You think your breast could hold up?  I think so.  There could be upwards of 10,000 squeezes.  That's fine with me. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah?  Uh-huh.  All right.  Man, you're rocked.  Maybe we could have her come down here and we'll have a couple of guys go through a test run.  Yeah, where are you?  Right now I'm at work.  I work at a hospital in a daytime.  Are you close to 57th and 7th?  Oh, no.  Hell no.  I'm in Queens now.  Oh, we got to get you down here and maybe have Earl and a bunch of the guys, you know,  give a test feel to make sure you're worthy.  Okay.  I'm serious.  When would this have to be?  Uh, hold on the line, all right?  Uh-huh.  She looks totally into it.  You can just tell.  She would definitely do it. 
[00:16:00]  Forty hips, dude.  That's why the box.  Baby got back.  That's why the box.  Shut up.  You're going to piss her off.  She's on hold listening to us.  We'll take any girl right now.  It's a hefty dumper.  They're not coming out of the woodwork here, Anthony.  All right.  We got to take what we can take.  Yeah.  I'll take a crack whore at this point.  We need to raise the money for charity.  Refrigerator box.  Shut up.  Right.  You need a washer dryer. 
[00:16:30]  All right.  All right.  Side by side.  You know, you blew it.  Now we lost our girl.  Come on.  No, no.  I didn't.  I'm sure.  You blew it.  She strips part-time.  I'm sure it'll be fine.  That's why the box.  That's why the holes.  You reach in.  You take your squeeze for a buck.  You're wrecking the whole concept, Anthony.  No, I'm not.  I just want to give quality goods to our faithful fans.  There's people that line up at soup kitchens every week.  And here we are trying to make them a little happier this holiday season. 
[00:17:00]  And now you've scared the chick off.  No, I'm okay.  I'm sorry.  I'm sure.  Take it back.  She's beautiful.  I completely take it back.  You sure?  I'm positive.  All right.  All right.  Man.  All right.  She hung up, though.  Oh, no.  So now I got to tell her to call back.  Oh, well.  Thanks, Anthony.  Well, we need more girls, anyway. 
[00:17:30]  Yes, we do.  I've got a good fax here.  If you want to send a fax in 212-957-WNEW.  Opie and Anthony, I would like to share with you how I became a member of your great Tuesday  Night Hummer Club.  Me and my girlfriend came into the city on Tuesday to see the Christmas show.  And while sitting in traffic around Radio City, we were listening to your show.  When she says to me, are they talking about what I think they're talking about?  So I proceeded to tell her about your lovely little club.  I knew this worked on her mind, though. 
[00:18:00]  God, look at this writing.  It's so hard to read.  Wow.  And it's such a great story, too.  I knew this worked on her mind throughout the night because she kept on mentioning it.  Well, after the show and dinner and a couple of bottles of wine, we went back to my van  to go home.  As soon as we left the parking lot, she proceeded to make me a member.  Now, I don't know if you realize how hard it is to have this being done to you while  you're driving in New York City traffic.  You just can't concentrate.  Well, we finally get to the tunnel where traffic is moving and I can relax a little bit. 
[00:18:30]  I am going through the tunnel and buses are beeping at me because I am all over the road.  Finally, as we reach the end of the tunnel, the job was completed.  Oh, that's timing.  So he became a member in the tunnel.  Came shooting out of the tunnel?  Who's on line two?  Congratulations.  Oh, Stephanie's back.  Oh, Anthony, I apologize to her.  Stephanie.  Stephanie.  Yes.  Hi. 
[00:19:00]  Hi.  Did you hear Anthony abusing you?  Yes, I did.  Oh, wow.  Now, okay, let's clear something up.  Okay.  I'm very grateful that you want to help out for this worthy charity, Feels for Meals.  It was just the 40 hips that got me a little bit.  It's just my rear end.  It's very, very nicely shaped and it's very, very, very, very, very pretty.  What's your ethnic heritage, ma'am?  I'm Dominican and white.  Oh, really?  Do you have like a Jennifer Lopez butt? 
[00:19:30]  Everybody tells me that I even look like her.  You do?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Okay, that's okay.  You don't look like the retarded version of Jennifer Lopez, do you?  No, no, no.  Like the one chromosome off version?  Yeah.  Like you ever see Patrick Swayze's brother?  Like there's Patrick Swayze, who the chicks really like, and then there's Patrick Swayze's  brother, who looks like Patrick Swayze with like a chromosome off, if Patrick Swayze was  retarded.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm absolutely gorgeous.  And there's Tom Hanks.  And Tom Hanks' brother. 
[00:20:00]  And Tom Hanks' brother, who looks like the retarded version of Tom Hanks.  They do that to you on the talk shows all the time.  And I was like, hey, let's bring out Barbra Streisand's sister.  It's like, oh my God, is she in a home?  I can't believe I'm better than Barbra Streisand.  All right.  Just a little bit better.  All right.  So you look like a retarded version of Jennifer Lopez.  I am absolutely gorgeous.  All right.  All right.  I am.  Okay.  So you won't need a side-by-side washer dryer box.  No, I'm sure.  Okay.  I'm just making sure.  All right. 
[00:20:30]  All right.  And we haven't turned you off yet.  Okay.  We haven't turned you off yet?  No.  Okay, good.  We'll try harder.  No.  You say you dance part-time?  Yes, I do.  What did you do since Giuliani cracked down, though?  Oh, I still do.  He doesn't bother me.  He's not paying my rent.  Oh, I like that.  Man ain't paying my rent.  Not at all.  So you're in one of the clubs that hasn't been shut down yet?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yep.  All right.  We'll have to go there.  Is it one of those cheap strip clubs?  One was, but not anymore. 
[00:21:00]  I don't want to say the name.  Yeah, I wouldn't do that either.  But half the girls come out and they have cesarean scars and C-section scars.  And they're like six months pregnant and they're crack whores.  It's like, oh, great.  This is fun.  I mean, I shouldn't have C-section end your career as a dancer.  I mean, it's like if you're a star basketball player or a football player and you get this  radical knee injury.  It's tragic and all, but you can't play the game anymore.  You got to face it and move on and leave it to the people who are able. 
[00:21:30]  So when that girl comes out and starts taking it off, maybe you saw her at the bar and you're  like, oh, I can't, I'm going to stick around and milk this beer until she hits the stage.  And then she comes on, takes her little get up off and you're like, oh, wow.  Wow.  Well, Stephanie, frankincrotch.  Stephanie, I asked that just because the first time I went to a strip club, that's what  happened to me. 
[00:22:00]  And I've been horrified ever since.  Yeah.  And I remember the song because of that.  What?  There is a house in New Orleans.  They call the rise.  That was your first song, yeah.  Yeah.  And then the girl like had the big, huge C-scar.  I had a great experience.  My first booby dancer, she did a rug act.  That was the first thing I ever saw.  She brought the quilt from her, you know, ninth, when she was in the ninth grade.  That her grandmother probably like quilted for her. 
[00:22:30]  And she opens it up on the stage and I didn't know anything because it's the first time I'm  in there.  I'm like, what is she doing?  I don't know about a match.  Oh, she lays down and then the music starts.  We got tonight.  Who needs tomorrow?  Let's make it last.  And I'm just like, oh, yeah.  Look, she's looking at me.  I think she likes me.  She doesn't like all the rest of these guys.  You're special.  I'm special.  And then she pulls out the hand lotion and all of a sudden, I love that maneuver. 
[00:23:00]  What's that about, man?  Vaseline intensive care.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, I can do something special with a match.  Oh, you're the match girl.  Oh, there's a couple of clubs in Long Island that does that.  Hey, man, do you want to pay for a match?  What do you mean pay for a match?  Can you pick up the beer bottle?  No.  No?  Uh-uh.  I used to be at a place in Ronkonkoma, Bird's Place.  Uh-huh.  I went there.  This girl could pick up a beer bottle.  Really? 
[00:23:30]  Just leave it at that.  Use your imagination.  But then, like, after a while, I just wanted to drink my beer.  So she's walking along the bar, and when she'd come over, I'd, like, cover the top of my  beer.  Like, no thanks.  No, thank you.  Hello.  All right.  Okay.  Great.  Well, we're looking forward to meeting you.  All right.  Yeah, Stephanie.  You're going to hopefully be our girl in the box for our Feels for Meals program.  Okay?  All right.  Hold on the line, because now Rick's got to talk to you a little more.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Cool.  All right.  She's not pissed at us. 
[00:24:00]  Sounds like a party girl.  I like her.  Yeah, bro.  Sounds fun.  All right.  On the way, we got Ted Nugent.  Damn it.  Nobody does.  You bastard.  That's my bit.  You stole it.  Come on.  We have other radio stations stealing our bits, and now you're stealing my bit.  This is a community property in this room.  I don't have many bits, and you stole one of mine.  You bastard.  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen, Opie was the one that came up with the Patrick Swayze's brother.  Looks like the retarded version of Patrick Swayze.  I remembered him saying it. 
[00:24:30]  I brought it up thinking everything's community property.  But for some reason, Opie needs credit.  Well, I can't sit here and do like.  He needs to be coddled and cuddled.  But I can't sit here and do a dice to make up for it and steal one of your bits.  I can't do voices.  You're talking about a bit.  That's a dice that comes in here.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry about that, Anthony.  What about the pork guy?  Yeah.  I can't just sit here and steal your pork guy.  I can't do it.  I only have two bits.  You stole one of my bits.  I hope that cleared everything up. 
[00:25:00]  Opie, Patrick Swayze, retarded brother bit.  All I was trying to say is when you see the talk shows and they bring out the brothers and stuff,  they look like the actor if he was retarded.  Hey, it's Helen Hunt's sister.  Let's bring her out.  Whoa.  She's got twice the forehead.  All right.  Uh, we need to talk about MindSpring, Anthony, really fast here.  We like MindSpring.  We like them a lot.  You need, uh, internet service.

[00:27:00]  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  You've got to stick around.  On the way, we're going to be talking to Kathy Jo.  Now, I don't even know where to begin because I'm going to be grossed out.  Well, remember when we had Mark Golan in from Maxim Magazine about three weeks ago?  He's our pal.  He's our pal.  We were talking about one of his issues.  Is it the December issue that did all the strange jobs? 
[00:27:30]  Yes.  It is, right?  Yeah.  In the latest issue of Maxim Magazine with, what's her name on the cover?  Who's on the cover?  I'm so unprepared here.  Yasmine Bleeth.  Yeah, Yasmine Bleeth.  Yasmine.  Okay, inside, he does a whole article on people that have very strange jobs in America, okay?  And there's a guy that, like, takes gophers out of holes in the Midwest and cute little jobs.  And there was one that interested us, a lady, Kathy Jo, that has a company called Crime Scene Steam and Clean.  We leave the scene clean and pristine. 
[00:28:00]  What this lady does for her job, she goes to, you know, crime scenes where people kill themselves or murder someone else or whatever.  And the coroner, they usually just take the body away and maybe some of the big pieces.  And they leave you, your house, in a complete mess.  Mess.  With blood and guts and skull fragments, whatever.  Now, who's going to clean that up?  I never thought about who goes in and cleans it up.  Remember Pulp Fiction?  Oh.  You know how much blood is in a person? 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  And if they bleed out all over your rug, who are you going to call?  I always thought maybe the coroner cleaned it up.  No, they just take the body away and they move on.  This lady, Kathy Jo, has this company, Crime Scene Steam and Clean, and she goes in, after the coroner takes the body out, and she cleans up the scene.  Let's look at some of this.  Decomp cleaning only without fogging or dump.  Three hours, two people cleaning, 800 bucks.  And then they have four to five hours, two people cleaning, 800. 
[00:29:00]  That's with dumping.  Mm-hmm.  Decomp.  That's what a body's been just laying around for hours.  I like the price differential between shotgun and small gun.  What's that?  It's like twice the price for a shotgun.  To clean up a shotgun murder or suicide?  Yeah.  Oh, we got to talk to this girl.  I am getting so skeeved out, but we're going to talk to Kathy Jo in just a bit here and see what she's all about, how she got into it, and if she enjoys her job. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to lose it.  Get the heebie-jeebies on you.  So there you go.  You have that to look forward to on the ride home.  Okay.  And we're getting a ton of requests for the Special Olympics song, so we might as well do it here.  We had our new pal Stephen Lynch in last Friday.  He was a huge, huge hit.  Everyone's emailing him at pushead at AOL.com, P-U-S, head at AOL.com.  And this was a song that he told us about off mic, and we said, you just got to do it for our show. 
[00:30:00]  And he goes, dude, I don't know, man.  This is way out there.  And we basically forced him to do a Special Olympics song on our show last Friday.  All right, Anthony, Kathy, Joe is on hold and standing by.  All right.  We'll talk to the lady that owns the company Crime Scene Steam & Clean.  You're not going to believe this one.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Don't forget, later on tonight, right here on NEW at 10 o'clock, we've got the Lenny Kravitz exclusive concert from the time he was touring in October. 
[00:30:30]  It's going to be very, very cool.  That's brought to you by your local Nissan dealer.  Opie, on our phone, we have Kathy Joe out on the West Coast.  She is the owner of Crime Scene Steam & Clean.  We leave the scene clean and pristine.  Yes, we found out about this lady through the latest issue of Maxim Magazine.  Yeah, they had an issue, December's issue.  The latest issue, right?  With Yasmin Bleeth.  Yeah, and they have unusual jobs that some people have, and Kathy Joe cleans crime scenes. 
[00:31:00]  Because, in essence, the cops and everybody just take out the bulk of it, the body, and leave the blood all over the place in pieces.  And you need somebody to go in there and clean up.  Yeah, I never thought about that.  You're not going to want to go in there and clean up somebody you know, so you hire people.  Well, I'm getting grossed out already, and we haven't even talked to her yet.  All right, let's talk to Kathy Joe.  Her company is called Crime Scene Steam & Clean. 
[00:31:30]  Kathy Joe.  Hello.  How are you?  Fine, thank you.  I cannot believe what you do for a living.  Yeah, it's pretty gruesome sometimes.  Sometimes?  I would say all the time.  Nah.  Now, how did you get into this?  A friend of mine in Chicago had a friend who killed himself with a shotgun, which is very, very messy.  And they took the body away, and she stood there saying,  What do you mean?  You don't clean it up.  And my friend called me, and I went back to help out.  And then I started looking around and found out that at the time, which was about four years ago, 
[00:32:00]  nobody was doing this kind of thing.  But it's not the kind of job you would just want to jump into.  No.  So this is your own business?  Yeah.  And I guess you're making money at this.  Yeah, we do pretty good.  How much do you like you're clearing a year?  Well, we can talk between, you know, say, 40 and 60.  Oh, that's not bad.  Yeah.  Wow.  Now, how many jobs do you get a year?  This year we're doing really good.  In fact, I just did one this morning, and that was number like 80 for the year.  And what was it?  What was it? 
[00:32:30]  It was a shotgun suicide.  And, all right, so you show up at the house, and what do you find?  Oh, lots of bits and pieces.  They take all the big things, and they just sort of leave all the little stuff for us.  Oh, my Lord.  So where do you start?  That's always the question.  That's exactly the question.  You look at it and go, oh, Lord, now where do I start?  Usually we start in the far corner and work our way out.  Oh, my God.  Especially in a shotgun.  Oh, yeah.  I see on your price list that the shotgun rate is double the small gun rate. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, yeah.  A shotgun usually takes, well, today we have three people, but usually it's two people, and  so anywhere between six to eight hours, usually.  It's every bit as big a job as a decomp.  A decomp?  Yeah, what do you do with a decomp?  Well, we have excellent masks that we wear.  It smells that bad, huh?  Oh, yes.  It's really bad.  And, in fact, usually the only way they can get rid of the smell is to call me.  I've had people almost literally tear down their homes trying to get rid of it. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, man.  And how do you get rid of it?  Oh, that's the trade secret.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, Ixnay on the...  Secret recipe.  You betcha.  Is it true that when some of these people kill themselves, you find pieces of them in  three or four different rooms?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, in a shotgun case, yeah, absolutely.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's just, it really is amazing.  Oh, my God.  Now, this is the busiest time of the year for this?  Yeah, yeah, really, from, usually from Thanksgiving until after tax time. 
[00:34:00]  I know, but it's true.  Do you go to work just hoping the phone's going to ring with the job?  You never know when you're going to get the call.  In fact, after we did the shotgun this morning, I got another call for a job, a decomp, in  fact, over the weekend.  So we could get a couple in a row, and we might go for a week without getting any.  Oh, my God.  You never know.  You just never know.  What is the sickest scene you cleaned up?  There was one job that really stands out, because if the incident happened, it was a  natural death, but it was a decomp.  The body had been there for a while. 
[00:34:30]  And it happened a year ago, August, and they called me more than a year later to clean  it up.  Whoa.  They had locked it down for over a year before they, and that was on a third floor apartment  building of a very nice, swanky place down in, like, Santa Monica.  And we took out over two tons of crap out of that place.  Oh, didn't the whole apartment complex smell?  Wouldn't you think?  I mean, I would have thought it would have, and I can't imagine how the other tenants  put up with it, but apparently nobody cared. 
[00:35:00]  Wow.  Now, where do you take this junk after you're done ripping it out?  Well, in California, we have a law here that companies like myself help to pass that makes  the biohazardous material that we take out of there, anything that's covered with blood  and body fluid, is considered medical waste, and it has to go to a burn site.  It's actually considered a biohazard, which is really the reason, one of the reasons  they hire companies like mine, not just to make the mess go away, because it truly is  a serious health hazard.  Hey, is it true you come to some of these locations, and it's dark, and you're like, 
[00:35:30]  oh, man, I've got to, you know, open up the window or put up the blinds, and then you realize  there's just millions of flies on the window?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I've actually, especially in a decalp situation, you know, where the body's been there for a  while, that's part of the natural process.  And I vacuumed, like, eight bags of flies out of a window.  Oh, my God.  It was really bad.  Oh, my Lord.  And you don't have to chase them around like you do in the house, you know, when you've  got one and you're after it with a fly slaughter. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  You can still sit there, you know.  Now, you're located in L.A. I'm assuming that you did some high-profile cases.  Yeah, we've done a few.  Any that you can hint toward?  No.  No, sorry.  Really?  No, we do try to be discreet.  I mean, we've had jobs where, you know, the reporters were hiding in the bushes with  telephoto lenses, and there's helicopters overhead and that kind of stuff.  And we try to keep a low profile.  I mean, our clients are usually, you know, obviously pretty upset, and they're under a  lot of strain.  Phil Hartman.  They don't need that kind of stuff. 
[00:36:30]  Phil Hartman.  So we try not to.  We don't talk about it.  Phil Hartman?  No, I can't say.  Oh, that means yes.  I can't say.  Oh, that means yes.  How messy was it?  Can't say.  I can't say.  Oh.  Not commenting.  No comment.  Oh, she cleaned up Phil Hartman.  Oh, my God, Kathy.  Client, you know, we don't get a lot of repeat business, but we do try to honor the, you know,  the memory of what we do.  Tell your friends.  Yeah.  Did you ever get so sick of a job that you just couldn't do it? 
[00:37:00]  Well, you know, when I started this business, the idea that there was no job we wouldn't  do was just a question of how much it would cost.  Right.  But there have been some jobs where we have sort of a rule that if you toss it, you have  to clean it yourself.  Our clients aren't paying us to clean up our own mess.  And there's been a couple where I almost lost it.  Oh.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh.  It was really bad.  God.  Do you have nightmares or anything?  Oh, actually, there have been a couple that I, well, and I'm not making this up now.  I used to feed my cats raw liver, chicken liver. 
[00:37:30]  I don't do that anymore.  I can imagine.  And there were a couple of jobs that I, the real messy things, there have been a few that  I, I laid awake at night going, oh, my God, I'm getting like skeeved out.  I swear to God, I can't continue this.  Are you married?  No.  No.  When you date somebody, do you tell them what you do?  Well, I try not to bring it up first thing.  Yeah, I wouldn't.  That's a good, good rule of thumb there.  And actually, you know, I need a lot of cops in corners. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, yeah, so they don't care.  Yeah.  They're kind of used to it.  Yeah.  Well, all right.  Well, that's some job you got.  What's your next job?  Do you know yet?  Well, we'll probably have that decop over the weekend.  Oh, you can't wait, huh?  Yeah.  I'm excited.  We're having a little OT on the weekend.  Yeah, well, you get paid a little extra for the weekend.  You ever do cars, like trunks or anything?  Yeah, I have done cars.  Actually, not a trunk, but I've done cars.  Yeah.  I don't like to do them.  I try to encourage people to just trash it, but sometimes they want to try and save it. 
[00:38:30]  What is it, like the scene out of Pulp Fiction?  You ever see that?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it's very much like that.  You've got to clean the guy's face off the back window and stuff?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's very much like that.  Oh, my Lord.  I swear to God, I don't know what to say.  I'm like, I'm so grossed out.  Well, you can just imagine having to try to clean up Uncle George yourself.  God.  Yeah, do you ever think about these people as humans or anything?  Are you picking up parts of their skull?  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  But you know what it is, when you do these jobs, you go through, you have to go through 
[00:39:00]  all the personal property, and you see things in there that they wouldn't want their mother  to know about.  Oh, really?  Yeah, you really get to know these people on a very intimate level.  What was the wildest thing you saw in that regard?  Stacks and stacks and stacks and stacks and stacks of porno films and magazines.  Well, I don't know.  There was the guy that we did that was in drag when we cleaned him up.  That was kind of weird, too.  Was in drag?  Yeah.  That was a little thing.  He blew his head off?  Can I say that?  It was one of those auto-erotic things. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Oh, he strangled himself?  And he slipped, yeah.  And you had to clean up one of those?  Well, he was there for a couple days before anybody found him.  Oh, my God!  So that was kind of strange.  How embarrassing.  Not only going like that, but you're in a dress.  Well, exactly.  I mean, that was, you know, exactly.  I felt really bad for her.  I mean, his grandmother was our client.  I felt really bad for her.  We cleaned up all of that stuff so she didn't have to deal with that before, you know.  I mean, that was terrible for her.  Well, you're talking about this like, you know, you're discussing a soap opera. 
[00:40:00]  It's like no big deal to you.  Well, it is a big deal.  I mean, each case is different, and everybody is a human being.  I mean, you do understand that.  Yeah.  And empathizing with our clients is a big part of the business.  I mean, we hear a lot of stuff, and they always want to vent.  They always want to tell you about whoever you're cleaning up.  Whoever you're cleaning up.  He was a good guy.  Could you get that spot?  Yeah.  Or they say, God, you know, that guy was such a rotten person, I'm really glad he's not around anymore.  I mean, people tell you all kinds of stuff.  When you leave in the job site, do you look at each other over and go, hey, you got a little bob on your cheek or something, you know? 
[00:40:30]  God, no.  I hope not.  We're pretty careful about that kind of thing.  All right, Kathy Jo.  We'll let you go.  Okay.  This has been quite an experience.  Well, thanks for calling.  Thank you.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, you're going to have nightmares.  Let's get back into the tunes here.  I think it's safer that way. 
[00:41:00]  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, Aerosmith coming to town December 27th.  Can't wait.  And supposedly, Stephen Tyler's stopping by the studio for a little visit.  He promised us when we talked to him on the phone, and hopefully, he's a man of his word.  Kick his skinny ass if you don't come in here.  You think we'll even be on the radio, though?  I'm trying to think.  When is the concert?  Thursday, Friday, Sunday, Sunday, Sunday?  It was like two weeks from Sunday? 
[00:41:30]  December 27th, do the math?  Yeah, I think so.  So, I guess we won't be talking to him.  No?  Well, I hope he comes here anyway.  God.  He better come here anyway.  We love Aerosmith.  Right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Everyone is freaking out about the crime scene lady.  Ugh.  That was just...  I think I finally found my line.  Why?  Because I was really grossed out.  It takes a lot to gross me out and skeeve me out.  I thought it was pretty interesting. 
[00:42:00]  It was interesting, but then I just started getting this feeling inside that I just needed to barf.  Ew.  I'm serious.  I started, like, dry heaving inside.  Really?  Just thinking about it right now.  I'm not happy.  You're a little much.  Seriously?  Yeah, you're a little, like, a little puss.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah.  I've proven that I'm a puss on this radio show.  Yeah, look at you.  I could take a lot, but...  A little skeeved out?  I'm totally skeeved out.  And she goes in where people commit suicide and cleans up the houses. 
[00:42:30]  That doesn't skeeve you out?  I'm not doing it.  I wouldn't...  If I walked into the place, I would, but I could listen to people talk about it.  And she's talking about it like she's having tea with the neighbors.  Like, it's no big deal.  You know?  Thank God there are people like that that could do that.  I was surprised when she told us how much she made.  She said between $40,000 and $60,000 a year.  I thought it would be more.  I was expecting hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Yeah, who wants to do that? 
[00:43:00]  I guess the people don't have a lot of money.  You know?  See?  I'm getting freaked again.  All right.  Yeah, you've got, like, some issues.  Hi, Eddie W.  All right.  Forget all this morbid crime scene crap.  What's the deal with Feels for Meals?  It's progressing quite nicely, Feels for Meals.  Come on.  My hands are throbbing here.  I want to grab some boobies.  Come on.  We have a girl coming in tomorrow to audition.  We're going to have a couple of guys come up and give test squeezings. 
[00:43:30]  Excellent.  And see if this is the type of charitable boobs we want to put out there for you guys.  I've got a question for you, though.  Yeah.  I'm not one of those privileged guys that have sampled the, how do you say, the silicone,  the unnatural breasts.  I've had plenty of natural breasts.  I'm curious on the silicone factor.  Will you have, like, a sample silicone woman there?  Yeah, I think we should.  I think we should have all different shapes and sizes.  Yeah, I'm seeing a variety here.  You know, you get to pick your own box, you know, a whole selection there.  No, that's a good idea.  It all depends on how many girls we can get. 
[00:44:00]  Looks like Stephanie's into it, but we've got to make sure she's worthy.  We'll give some test squeezes and make sure her breasts will hold up, because we know  we'll get thousands of guys and girls willing to squeeze them.  Oh, forget it.  I've got my pockets full of money for it already.  You know the deal.  The girl's going to be in the box.  She's going to be topless.  You've got some holes in the box.  You pay us a dollar, then you reach in, and you get a nice, quick squeeze for the dollar.  And all the money raised goes to feed the hungry during the holiday season.  Yeah, I don't care where the money goes.  Just give me some boobies.  Well, the only reason we're doing this is because we want to, you know, feed some hungry people 
[00:44:30]  this holiday season.  Hey, if you're looking for something different this Christmas, give a gift of value this  season and adopt a take-pause pet for those special persons on your list.  What are you going to do?  Go to the mall?  You want to deal with those parking lots?  No, I don't want to deal with Christmas shopping at all.  What are you going to do?  I don't feel like starting.  I'm starting to shop online.  I think it's a lot easier.  It is.  And these take-pause pets, they're cool jungle animals, and their eyes are wicked because 
[00:45:00]  you swear they're looking right at you.  Yeah, it's not like these cheapo stuffed animals that have, like, button eyes.  These things are, they look like real eyes.  They follow you.  Yeah.  Yeah, pretty cool.  And we've been saying this all along, but you brought one home to Jennifer, your wife,  and she loves it, right?  She loves it.  It's like a pet to her now.  What?  Does she feed it?  Well, no.  But she, you know, scratches it under the chin.  Oh, my God.  Hi, kitty.  What the hell's going on at your house?  That's how people react to these things. 
[00:45:30]  All right.  And these are, these first take-pause pets are limited, numbered, and not available in stores.  And just like Beanie Babies and Hummels and other collectibles, the first generation is  usually the most valuable.  If you're interested in checking them out for yourself and you're online right now, you  can go to their website.  It's www.takepause, with a Z, at the end there, .com.  1027 WNEW, the rock of New York, Guns N' Roses, a little patience.  Joe Walsh, before that, it's Sophie and Anthony. 
[00:46:00]  And our Feels for Meals program is developing quite nicely here, Anthony.  Yes.  I'm pretty proud of our faithful listeners out there.  They're into our cause.  Coming to the table.  Yes.  You know, we're getting calls from girls who want to be in the box.  Actually, we got a girl on hold here that is thinking about going in the box.  Donating.  Her boobs.  For charity.  Yes.  Feels for Meals.  The guys pay the buck.  They get to, you know, squeeze a breast.  And we feed the homeless this holiday season. 
[00:46:30]  All the money goes to charity.  Let's talk to this lady here.  Hi, Terry.  What's up?  I'm just curious how you get in the box.  Well, first of all, we got to make sure you're worthy.  Right.  What kind of body do you have?  We have, I have 36 feet.  Okay.  All right.  Are they natural or fake?  No, they're natural.  Natural.  Do they hang nice?  They hang fine.  They serve me well.  Do you think they can take a beating?  Oh, sure.  Okay.  Can I ask how old you are?  37.  That's not bad.  That's in range.  All right.  It's acceptable. 
[00:47:00]  Well, we're trying to look for a girl that has some sturdy boobs.  There's going to be a lot of squeezing going on.  Sure.  Basically, the girl gets in the box.  She's topless.  Right.  Is she sight unseen?  Not if you don't want to show a face.  Okay.  You know?  Go ahead.  And then the guys and the girls line up.  And Anthony and I, we're like the pitch men.  We sit there with a hat.  You give us a dollar.  And then the guy or the girl, you know, steps up to the box.  There'll be a couple holes in the box.  They reach in.  Right.  And they reach around for your breasts and they get one quick squeeze. 
[00:47:30]  Okay.  And if they squeeze more than that, then we beat the hell out of them.  We'll have a couple bounces on hand.  Okay.  And that's it.  And then it's the next person, but this could go on for hours.  Right.  And when are you doing this?  Hopefully within the next week.  We've got to raise money for the homeless this holiday season.  Right.  That's why it's called Feels for Meals.  We're going to feed a lot of homeless people this holiday season.  It's a very good cause.  Okay.  Now, how tall are you?  Five foot three.  Five foot three. 
[00:48:00]  Wait.  Do I have to disclose this?  About one-third.  Well, yeah.  We've got to know what kind of box to get.  Yeah.  We want to make sure you can fit in the box.  Right.  About one-thirty.  One-thirty, five-three.  I wouldn't say slim.  Okay.  We might need like a washer and dryer type box.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little side-by-side.  Can we stick your head out the top of the box?  If necessary.  All right.  So your head will be popped out of the top of the box.  There'll be some holes right around where your breasts are.  Any children? 
[00:48:30]  Yes, two.  Uh-oh.  What?  Well, that sort of sometimes makes us have to cut the holes a little lower in the box,  if you know what I mean.  No.  The holes are in the right place.  Yeah.  We don't want to cut the holes for the box, you know, six inches off the ground.  No.  Okay.  Not at all.  Put it this way.  Between the breasts is not my navel.  We don't want guys to have to start getting on their knees to reach into the box.  It's a squeeze boom.  No, they're not down there.  All right.  Just making sure. 
[00:49:00]  What are you, holding some type of inspection first?  We're going to need you to come down here so we can get some test squeezes in.  No, I'm serious.  I fully understand.  You know, we're going to squeeze, make sure, you know, you're going to hold up.  That is.  Because you're going to get a workout.  Have some real squeezability, huh?  Yeah, we're going to have some guys come up, and we're going to run through the whole procedure.  Right.  With the box.  Right.  And see if your boobs can hold up.  Right.  Under the strain of, it could be 10,000 squeezes. 
[00:49:30]  Right.  You've got to realize.  Not a big deal.  Okay.  Okay.  Hold on the line for Rick.  Okay.  She's into it without a doubt.  We've got a lady on the line here, Anthony?  Yes.  She has a problem with feels for meals.  Oh.  Damn.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hi, what's going on?  Who am I speaking to, please?  Uh, Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  Buffy is?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I want to know one question.  Okay.  I listened to your show.  Mm-hmm.  All you have are women on the show. 
[00:50:00]  Women on the show.  What do you mean?  Squeeze the breath.  Yeah.  What's wrong with that?  What's about bringing a man in?  All right.  We've discussed this yesterday.  We have to try it out with the feels for meals first, and then we're going to have wax  for snacks for you ladies if it really takes off.  Yeah.  Well, we'll, you know, get some slob and put them in a box and, uh... 
[00:50:30]  You know, it's only the women.  Huh?  Well, the women want to do it, you know, and...  Maybe some men want to do it, too.  Well, all right.  Well, we'll look into that.  We'll explore that option, but, uh, you know, our whole goal is to, uh, raise some money for  the needy this holiday season.  And we think there'll be more guys.  Well, yeah, exactly.  Than girls.  Exactly.  More guys, actually...  But there's girls out there that may want to...  There's a lot of girls that...  Feel a little bit.  Well, there's a lot of girls that have been calling saying they're into squeezing as well. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, sure.  Whatever it takes to raise money, they're into it.  Exactly.  So, all right.  We got to go.  So we may hear this.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Bye.  That's great radio.  Cool.

Everybody talks behind this guy's back.  Look at the dead rat on that guy's head.  Yes.  We, anonymously, will call him and tell him in plain English, you know, hey, it looks bad.  Yes.

Well, if you want us to break some news for you tomorrow, it is FU Friday, so it's a perfect  day for that.  Mm-hmm.  It's a way to, um, um, uh, extend that concept a bit.  Yeah.
