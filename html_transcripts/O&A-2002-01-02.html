<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The January 2nd, 2002, Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts discussing their post-vacation return and the confusing changes to their show's phone numbers.  They then contrasted the record-breaking seven feet of snowfall in Buffalo with the surprisingly snowless November and unexpected snowfall in Atlanta. Opie recounted a skiing trip, mentioning a possible sighting of another skier. A listener called in to describe the chaos caused by the Buffalo snowstorm. This led to a philosophical tangent about the vastness of time and humanity's insignificance in the grand scheme of the universe, touching on global warming and the sun's eventual expansion.

A large segment focused on video games, particularly *Grand Theft Auto 3*, *NHL 2002*, *EverQuest*, and the upcoming *State of Emergency*. Listeners called in detailing their *GTA 3* exploits and addiction, and the hosts discussed the game's features and their meeting with Rockstar Games representatives.  Other games like *Max Payne* and Game Boy Advance titles were also mentioned.

The conversation then shifted to airport security following the shoe bombing attempt. Opie shared his security experiences, expressing frustration with its effectiveness.  A discussion about Richard Reed ensued, escalating into a highly offensive, racist, and xenophobic rant by Anthony targeting Arabs and Muslims. This segment concluded with a listener's song about the shoe bomber, "Brother Joe."

The show continued with a listener repeatedly shouting about shoe bombs and his mother.  The hosts discussed their phone numbers and a group of listeners who gathered outside the studio hoping to see women flash.  Anthony recounted his New Year's Eve spent overlooking Times Square from a rooftop after gaining access to the office with Garrett's key. He discussed the heavy security and the possibility of a sniper attack.  Calls from listeners followed, including one from an intoxicated "Psycho Mark," covering topics such as a cook's unusual habit of carrying shrimp, Benny Hanna's possible jail time, Mike Tyson's altercation in Havana, and rumors about NSYNC in a *Star Wars* film.

Further discussion included New Year's resolutions, the Polar Bear Club, a listener's racist message about Muhammad Ali, commercials, and listener complaints about commercial repetition.  Many listener calls and anecdotes filled this segment, punctuated by the hosts' often inappropriate commentary.  A failed live birthday segment and a brief appearance by radio personality Eddie Trunk were also included.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to brainstorming new radio segments. Opie and Anthony, along with numerous callers, suggested many absurd and offensive ideas, including sexually suggestive concepts, a game involving a baby's death, and various other themed segments based on numbers, music genres, and listener participation, frequently laden with racist and sexist jokes. A "FU Line" for angry callers was also established. Music and a commercial for arthritis medication were played during this segment.

The show culminated in a discussion of Muhammad Ali's appearance at a film premiere, where he told a series of extremely offensive jokes targeting various ethnic and religious groups. The hosts described Ali's physical state and recounted the jokes, along with his wife's attempts to stop him and his representatives' response.  A "What Did We Learn?" call-in segment followed, with listeners sharing their takeaways, often referencing the Ali jokes.  The recurring "Day Late Guy" segment was also included, and the offensive and racially charged humor continued with numerous callers and frequent caller Joe contributing to the offensive material.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Whee!  The year 2002, everyone.  All relaxed from our vacations, aren't we?  We are live.  The holidays.  We haven't been live in, what, two weeks now, Anthony?  It's been a while.  What day is it today? January 2nd, 2002?  It was very nice to come back and come back on time,  not have to worry over the vacation if we had a job  like last year. 
[00:00:30]  This is kind of nice.  Oh, yeah.  Stress-free.  That's right.  We didn't have to do that big meeting this year.  No big meeting with any big weeks.  That's nice.  A couple phone numbers.  Oh, wow.  They got, like, new things up over there.  What's that?  What was wrong with the old phone number signs?  Look how confusing that is.  There's a New York City number.  There's all shows.  Get out that number.  Then there's the O&A national number.  And then the Don and Mike national number.  Which ones do we choose? 
[00:01:00]  Oh, no.  There's too many numbers.  I don't know which phone numbers to read.  What are we going to do?  All right.  In the New York area, 212-757-1027.  That's not what we used to use, right?  Which one?  For all shows?  Oh.  What?  Oh, what?  What?  Yeah, right?  Looks like everyone was hard at work while we were gone.  They made new signs to screw us up.  Changing phone numbers? 
[00:01:30]  No, we used the other one, right?  All shows.  So, 877-692-1027 if you're in the New York area, right?  And then the national number.  Well, then I say everyone else, including...  Ah.  Buffalo.  Poor Buffalo.  Holy S. Buffalo.  Yeah.  You can give us a call, 866-277-4WOW, 7 feet of snow in Buffalo.  I hope you enjoyed your November.  Thank God I got out of Buffalo 10 years ago.  Yeah, that's something.  That's rough. 
[00:02:00]  7 feet of snow.  7 feet of snow in Buffalo.  They couldn't even plow it out of the way.  They were picking it up on big bulldozers and carting it out.  The best.  And I used to watch people do this when I was living up there.  Snowblowing the roof.  Of your house.  Snowblowing the roof of your house.  Because you've got to get the snow off, obviously, because, you know, your freaking roof could come in on you.  Or collapse or something.  Those poor bastards.  Well, that's what you get.  I was up there for some of those insane storms, but this takes the game, they're saying, right? 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, this was the most snow they had over that time period.  Right.  After getting no snow in November for the first time in recorded history.  And now it's snowing in, what, Atlanta today?  Yeah.  I don't know what we're doing with the weather.  That global warming thing is nothing.  Nah.  I kind of enjoy it, but then it kind of screws things up like that.  You get a little snow here.  As long as we get off with a mild winter here in New York City, I could care less.  I don't care what happens. 
[00:03:00]  It's coming.  That's what they say, but, you know, you've got to worry, and it's so true, you've got to worry when they say...  I walked out the door today going, what the S is going on, right?  It's kind of nice.  It sucked.  Why?  It's getting cold in New York.  It was warmer than it was.  Look at us, I don't know what I like to old men.  It was warmer yesterday.  Hey!  No way did someone see me skiing in Vermont.  Pat, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Did I...  You up in Vermont?  Because I'm not going to say where or not, but I was up in Vermont, and I... 
[00:03:30]  You can say, because I'm not there anymore.  You idiots.  True, true.  No, because I was up over that Stratton, and I could have swore, I don't know, that's just a quick thing.  Someone skied by a look like it.  Wow, the first curse of 2002, you tool.  I was skiing in Vermont, but not Stratton.  I went to a chemo, and then did a day trip to Killington, and rocked.  Did they actually have snow up there?  Yeah. 
[00:04:00]  All right, cool.  Well, it was a lot of rock skiing, you know, but...  So was it him?  Did he see you?  He said he died.  I don't know.  I don't think so.  I doubt I was here, but...  Oh, okay.  Second of all, I had...  Was he a good skier?  Not bad.  You don't want people thinking he's you.  He sucks.  Right.  He's going down with the pie wedge.  He's doing the pie wedge plowing down the hill.  No, I was at Okimo.  They took care of me up there.  Great Mountain and Killington, of course. 
[00:04:30]  Thanks, Pat.  Second of all, I got an XFL football game from when you guys signed it.  All right.  And one of them has go Jets from Stinky, and I got offered a lot of money for that ball.  It's the only one around.  Stinky's signature is...  And yours, and the coach, too, man.  Oh, wow.  Pretty funny, actually.  The XFL ball.  The only one around.  Hey, thanks for bringing up the Jets.  I really appreciate that, Pat.  First day back.  Thanks.  You're welcome.  Wee-s.  Yeah. 
[00:05:00]  Have a good year, guys.  Any little opportunity that can stand in front of that team, they will just blow it.  All right.  There you go.  Yeah, I blew off my family for Christmas.  You did?  Well, I went with Rick's family.  You know, Sandy and I, and then the rest of the gang, we rented a house up there in Vermont  for five days, but I was supposed to come home.  How many people in one house?  There was like 10 of us.  Yeah.  It was great, though.  Puerto Ricans are used to that, right?  Sure.  We're not actually used to having a whole house to use. 
[00:05:30]  That's true.  It's a room or a basement or a cell.  Exactly.  No, this ski house in Ludlow, it slept like 20 people.  Wow, nice.  Yeah, we had a good time, but I was supposed to come home Christmas morning to spend it with  my family.  Home for the holidays, hoping.  I blew them off to go skiing at Killington for the day, not feeling any guilt whatsoever.  Really?  You didn't do the dinner with the family?  No, I was supposed to, but I decided, you know, the skiing was so good.  Wow.  Then I couldn't be happier, so.  Oh, you didn't catch any grief from the family? 
[00:06:00]  No.  No, they could care less that I was not there either, so.  Because me, I know, I got to see my family.  Every Christmas Eve is the big tradition with my family, so.  So, you know, we go out to Grandma's house, same place we had at Thanksgiving, but I'm  always learning something new.  You know, they eat a lot of fish.  Your family?  The Italians on Christmas.  Yeah.  Those meat-the-balls.  Well, I don't have to know.  There's like 8,000 things thrown out all over the place. 
[00:06:30]  But a lot of fish.  And, you know, fish have bones in it.  You know, there was one piece of fish I took a bite into.  It was like I bit into a pin cushion.  And I just, I spit it out and I go, what is up with this?  Why are there bones sticking out?  Oh, you just got to know how to eat it.  You can eat it, there are bones.  There's fish without bones.  Because that's why, and then my aunt tells me this, that's why you got to go to church  and have your throat blessed.  And I was like, I'm like, I'm like, wait a minute.  What?  I go, you're kidding, right?  No.  Italians, oh, forget this. 
[00:07:00]  They go to church, like around the holidays, and the priest or whatever it is gets these  two, I guess, candles or something, and puts them next to your throat and gives it a blessing  so you don't choke on a fish bone.  It's the not choking prayer.  That's funny.  How about if you live in Chelsea, can he bless your throat in keeping the him from passing  the glory?  The ninja.  The ninja.  The bug.  Hey, Norton, what's going on, bro?  Howdy, old.  All right.  God.  And then I went out to Colorado. 
[00:07:30]  Went out to Colorado and then took a little day trip into Utah to the Arches National Park,  which looks like a bunch of movies were filmed out there.  Like Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and a lot of cowboy movies, a galaxy quest, a desert  scene.  It looks like Mars.  And there are these huge boulders teetering, just resting precariously on like, it looks 
[00:08:00]  like a golf tee.  It looks like someone teed up a huge boulder.  When you say huge boulders, how big?  Take this, take the size of this building across the entire building, make it round and a boulder  that big.  And what is it resting on?  It's just sitting on a base that is a few yards across, and it's like a spike in the middle  of the desert, and it's just teetering there, waiting for either a minute to go by or 10,000 
[00:08:30]  years to go by for it to fall.  No one knows.  Somewhere in between there.  Could fall on us, could fall on whatever populates the earth in a million years.  Well, what a way to go.  Yeah.  I know, I'm looking up just going, if this thing fell on me, it's got to be God's ultimate  little joke.  It's been sitting here, dinosaurs walked by and looked and went, wow, that is precariously  perched.  But it's going to fall on me. 
[00:09:00]  So we were walking around all those arches and stuff, and I learned a lot about that  whole thing.  The harder material, like the boulders, rest atop these soft pillars, and erosion, wind,  whatever, over millions of years, I think, wipes away a lot of the real estate under the  boulder.  So it just sits there.  Eventually, it'll fall, but that eventually, you know, will be long gone, Opie. 
[00:09:30]  I don't like learning about stuff like that.  I was looking at stuff that I'm sure, you know, primitive man looked at, and it looked  exactly the same.  That's how insignificant we are.  I don't want to listen.  I was in God's country.  I don't want to listen.  Marlboro country.  I don't know.  That stuff freaks you out.  I was like, why bother even living?  No one's even going to remember you were here.  I'm doing a whole bunch of reading about this area, you know?  Yeah.  And one part really freaked me out. 
[00:10:00]  The reason a lot of this happens is because of the salt foundation that is laid in this  desert.  And then other sediments and stuff build up around it, and the salt is unstable, so it  collapses.  It makes a bunch of caves and arches and whatnot.  But you know where the salt came from, Opie?  Oceans that had evaporated.  I was in there and I go, wow, when did that happen?  I don't remember seeing that on CNN.  Well, it happened in the early 80s, Anthony.  Why was there an ocean here in the desert? 
[00:10:30]  You can comprehend something happening in the early 80s, right?  It freaks you out.  I don't even want to think about it.  I'm standing there going, oh, this is so old.  This is some old stuff.  One summer I went to the rainforest in Seattle, Washington, or north of Seattle.  I think it's the whole rainforest.  And they had these huge prehistoric trees that fell down that had to be like 30 feet  across.  I mean, just humongous tree. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Just imagine a humongous tree, maybe about 20 to 25 feet across, okay?  Completely down in the forest.  And fallen so many years ago.  Many years ago, because growing out of the middle of this humongous tree is another humongous  tree that is feeding off the dead tree.  So first you had to go back.  You start doing the math in your head and you just want to go home to mama and suckle.  Because you cannot comprehend that much time going by. 
[00:11:30]  When you're in those situations, you realize what a little speck of crap we are.  Of nothing.  We are.  Of nothingness.  And people start talking like they're so bold how, you know, we have to do things to save  the planet.  And it's our responsibility to make sure the animals and this and each other are taken care  of.  It's nothing.  It's the drops that hit the windshield while they're on high.  That's what we are.  Blip, whoosh, gone. 
[00:12:00]  Blip, whoosh, gone.  No paying attention to it.  Blip, whoosh, gone.  The drops, Opie, hitting the windshield when it's on as fast as you can imagine.  When you look and go, God damn, I got fast wipers.  Blip, whoosh, gone.  That's us.  Don't sweat it.  All right.  We got to go to Buffalo here.  David, we have to.  Oh, a call.  David, what's up? 
[00:12:30]  Hey, what's going on?  Listen.  We've been watching you on TV for the last, what, week and a half now?  Did you see me?  I was the guy with the shovel.  Yeah, exactly.  That's how you guys can't even conceptualize the kind of snow we have.  I've been up there.  I mean, obviously, this is the worst ever, but I've been up there for some of them.  I mean, you drive down the roads, and you're driving in half tunnels  because the snow is piled 10 to 12 feet high on the sides of some of these roads.  Well, it's not even, it's every road now.  I mean, you hit a main road.  Did you want to throw in your Buffalo plug here where you knew what you were talking about? 
[00:13:00]  Main road, I don't know.  Say you're passing through Tonawanda.  Ooh.  Oh.  Tonawanda, okay.  Is that a local reference?  Yeah.  Yeah, I was going to say more like,  Lockport.  Well, you're pretty north of the city.  They got to talk to, but anyway.  Ciccawaga would have been a great reference there.  Ciccawaga.  Ciccawarsa.  As you're driving through.  A Polish community.  Ciccawaga.  It's as high as your van, as your SUV.  You can't see driveways.  You can't see in. 
[00:13:30]  You can't see out.  It's just snow.  You know what I don't miss about Buffalo?  You guys will not see the ground now until early April.  Oh, yeah.  We're doomed.  And we're going to get a lot more because, you know, we were significantly warmer in the  past summer.  The lake temperature is much, much warmer.  It hasn't even begun to freeze.  So as cold air comes down over the Great Lakes, it picks up the warm, moist water, hits the  cold land, and drops it.  Well, that's called the lake effect snow, yeah.  Yeah.  What's weird is you go a little south of Buffalo and they've got, what, two inches 
[00:14:00]  of snow?  Yeah.  Right.  Instead of the seven feet?  Yeah.  All right, man.  Well, hang in there, David.  More beer.  It's going to be a while before we make it to Buffalo.  We'll let this little winter thing pass by before we go road trip.  I think you've heard Buffalo radio and you know what we suffer with.  It's horrendous.  I feel bad for you guys.  Yeah.  I saw Larry Norton the other day.  He was just terrific.  It's like listening to your grandfather.  Yeah.  Anyone with any type of talent left the city years ago?  No offense to Buffalo, but, you know, it's one of those radio towns. 
[00:14:30]  You cut your teeth and you move on.  That's right.  If you're celebrating 20 years at the same station in Buffalo, that's not a good thing.  All right, gentlemen.  Drive fast.  Take chances.  All right, David.  Thank you.  All right.  That's what they do up there.  They don't care.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Someone wants us to make, wants to make us feel even more insignificant.  Adam, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  I just wanted you to know that you know that the sun is going to eventually expand past  our planet, destroying everything that's passed.  And then become a white dwarf.  So we really don't matter at all. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, but you know what?  That's so long.  But I can rationalize that in my head.  I'm just, you know, worrying about civilization after we all pass.  I'm just thinking that we'll be so knowledgeable that we'll figure it out and we'll start to,  we'll move the whole, I don't know, civilization to another planet.  Right.  Exactly.  Oh, well.  That's pretty much it.  Bye.  That's what we'll do.  Thanks, Adam.  We'll rock it off just like we're going to do in 2001.  Oh, that's right.  We didn't.  Yeah, that's right.  2001 passed.  Where's our big spaceship going to Jupiter? 
[00:15:30]  Absolutely.  To see things.  Yeah, where's the flying cars?  Oh, you know something?  The guy's got a point.  We're not inventing things.  We're not going to go and recolonize someplace.  We're just going to have to burn up when the sun gets too big.  Maybe we'll adapt.  I don't know about that.  Maybe we'll walk around with big cooling coils on our head.  Look what has happened to video games, Anthony.  Yes.  Very good segue.  Hope you've got the best present ever.  What did you get, a Game Boy?  I got the, I'm like addicted to PlayStation 2. 
[00:16:00]  And you know what?  Now I've got to get the Xbox, too, because I was at Joey Paisano's house for New Year's.  Xbox freaking rocks.  Yeah?  It freaking rocks.  Did you have the one with the serial numbers all scratched off?  Yeah, pretty much.  Did he?  When it fell off the truck down there in Little Italy?  But I really don't, I don't know what's going on in the world, because I just spent the  last two weeks between skiing and playing video games.  I have no clue.  Did he get Osama?  I have no idea.  No.  I heard about some guy, a sneaker bomb or something. 
[00:16:30]  A sneaker bomber, yeah.  I heard a little bit about that.  And I took a peek at the Jets just completely destroying their season once again.  But besides that, I was playing NHL 2002.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  More than Grand Theft Auto 3, my friend.  Uh-oh.  I'm now addicted to NHL 2002, taking a break from the Grand Theft Auto 3.  I don't know.  And my brother Quinn gets me the Game Boy Advance.  Yeah.  Which beats PlayStation 2, Xbox, and all computer games.  You've got to think of it, not like the old Game Boy, which is very blocky and clunky. 
[00:17:00]  The graphics on this are just like you get in an arcade.  Well, and that's the point I was going to make.  You got me the retro little game thing where you throw it into the slot.  And there's five games on there.  Yeah.  That in the early 80s, late 70s, would have been five huge machines at the bowling alley.  It's now in the little Game Boy Advance.  And not the cheap Atari version of Pac-Man.  No, no.  You got the real version.  It's the original arcade games.  Pretty good.  I was playing Ms. Pac-Man.  On the screen, it is as big as a postage stamp. 
[00:17:30]  Really?  How do you do that?  It's not easy.  It's kind of a pain in the ass, but it's fun to be able to play Ms. Pac-Man on the train.  Like that?  Yeah.  On Grand Theft Auto 3.  You finally did Grand Theft Auto 3?  Yeah.  When I can get it away from the girlfriend.  She likes it.  She likes running people over and stuff.  But, yeah, we've been playing that one.  God damn, what a great game.  I told you.  But you know what the one downer is?  You walk, you go to work.  Hush, hush. 
[00:18:00]  Hush, hush.  It's the radio stations.  She's on fire.  And the cars, right?  Yeah.  And I'm singing the dopey songs that are playing along in the cars that you jack.  You know you can turn off the radio in that game.  I don't know.  It's kind of fun when you get in.  You never know what's going to be on.  You get in there and just start running people over and killing them.  And great game.  What's your best part of Grand Theft Auto 3?  I'm actually liking getting the stunt bonuses when I'm not killing people.  But just walking around, getting out of the car with a baseball bat and just beating people over the head. 
[00:18:30]  I just went on a rampage in the park where I would just beat people over the head with the bat and take their money.  That was fun.  And then the cops are on to you.  You hop in a car.  And you take off.  And you take off.  You drive around very quickly and jump things and crash and kill things.  My new favorite thing is to steal the cab.  You could be a cab driver guy and you can pick up people and drop them off at these locations where no one's around.  And I'll take a look and go, wait, there's no one around. 
[00:19:00]  So I'll jump out of the car after they get out and beat the crap out of them.  You got money back.  You got it.  It's your duty.  Yeah, it's fun.  And now I just got to that new level.  The new...  Startin'?  Startin'.  Yeah.  Got out of Portland.  You got out of Portland?  Nice.  Startin' all opened up brand new now, so you got to learn the roads again.  You kind of get used to one area.  You drive around and go, okay, I know that's up here on the right.  You know, kind of swing it around.  And then you get the new area.  It's like, oh, it's kind of scary.  I spent about an hour, two hours just doing insane stunt bonuses by the docks. 
[00:19:30]  They have a ramp set up by all these tractor trailers, the trailers.  And you jump them.  And you get little bonuses if you do a flip or a stuff, yeah.  Things like that.  But then you got to jam on the brakes and you go right off into the water.  What a great game.  Goddamn.  Check out the parking garages.  Go to the top level of the parking garages.  Yeah.  You'll have some fun up there.  Yeah.  Because they got ramps set up and then you're jumping over buildings with your cars.  Nice.  And then, of course, Evercrack to EverQuest.  I was playing that a lot.  Got to thank Joe. 
[00:20:00]  Goddamn Joe helping me out from Cleveland.  Yeah.  He's a guy on EverQuest on the same server I'm on.  He hooked me up with stuff.  Helps me get a power level.  We're just friends there, Norton.  Friends helping friends in the video game world.  And type it in LOL.  Well, two men.  Let's get Norton involved in the conversation.  Yeah.  You know nothing about video games.  Pick up any hookers over there?  Yeah.  Well, on today's topic so far are weather, earth science, and computer games. 
[00:20:30]  Nobody in this room is ever getting laid again.  Yeah, I need to sully it with some prostitute chat.  That's funny.  Let's go to a couple more phones here.  Jimmy, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, bro.  I was just wondering, total estimation, how many hours do you think you guys play Grand Theft Auto 3?  Well, I was playing like 12 hours a day.  No joke.  I was. 
[00:21:00]  But now I'm playing NHL 2002.  I'm playing a whole season on the PlayStation 2.  Why?  You're playing a lot?  Yeah.  My friend lives in Quincy.  I just go over to his house and play with him a lot.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What's your favorite radio station on the game?  I like the talk stations.  Yeah, I like Chatterbox.  Yeah, Chatterbox.  That's right.  You notice when sometimes they're talking, you realize they're talking about you?  Yeah.  That is the most bizarre thing.  You steal a mafia guy's car, and all of a sudden you just happen to have Chatterbox on, 
[00:21:30]  and they're talking about how they're, you know, when they find the son of a bitch that  just hijacked him, you know, they're going to kill him and stuff.  And you're like, wait a minute, that's me.  I like when you jack the Diablos cars, the Spanish guys.  Yeah.  Hey, man, what are you doing?  And then you get in.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  You know you can make their cars bounce, right?  You can do the bounce.  Yeah, you can make their cars bounce.  Yeah, I got the codes off the internet.  Ah, that's classic.  I'm trying to find if there's anything else you can do with this game. 
[00:22:00]  I've checked out all the cheat codes, and I've picked up the hookers.  Hey, did you beat that race?  The race.  Did you do the race?  We got to get to the phone.  Oh, no.  You got to line up.  There's three cars.  It's hard to win in any of the races.  Yeah.  I just went on to another mention.  Well, you know what you got to do.  There's some really, really fast cars you got to find.  Yeah, but even then, you got to keep it on the goddamn road.  And those guys are trashing you.  And their computer, oh, what's up?  What?  Steve C. has a solution?  Wait, Steve, you got addicted to Grand Theft Auto 3 over Breakthrough? 
[00:22:30]  My chick regrets ever buying a formula.  She is furious because I was up until 3 a.m. the morning after Christmas.  Oh, early on.  Oh, yeah.  I was so addicted over the last two weeks.  I would play Grand Theft Auto 3, NHL 2002.  Then I would take a break from those games and pick up my Game Boy Advance to play, you  know, old school.  Gallagher.  Look at you.  How about sex?  I had some of that.  Did that come into play?  I had some of that. 
[00:23:00]  And to answer your question about the race, the way you do it is you use, well, I know this  goes against your ethics, but you use the code for the tank.  I don't like the tank.  You get the tank and position yourself perpendicular to the other cars in the race.  Right.  And the second the thing goes, you run over all the other cars.  And you win.  So you're the only one.  Or you can use the code that blows up every other car on the street.  Oh.  So, again, you're the only car.  Or just get the bazooka out.  You're going to have some fun with the bazooka.  The bazooka.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I like the cheats that you put in that give you the massive amounts of gore and disgust. 
[00:23:30]  Those are good.  But I just don't like the extra stuff cheats.  For a game console game, how unbelievable.  Yeah, very good.  And the graphics aren't that at all.  Jimmy, what's going on?  Jimmy.  Hello.  Jimmy wanted to say, oh, ever jump in the back of a pickup truck.  Did you do that?  No.  Grand Theft Auto 3.  You can just start shooting people.  Yeah, you can jump in the back of the pickup trucks.  And then they'll drive you around.  You can shoot and stuff.  I like grabbing a bus and just full blast a bus down the street and rear end someone stopped at a light. 
[00:24:00]  And see how far that car goes flying.  It's amazing.  It goes flying.  Anthony, what's up?  Hey, man.  I just wanted to say that I love your show.  Oh, thanks.  And also, on Grand Theft Auto 3, on the third level, on short side valve, there's a spot on the east side of the airport where there's two ramps in a row where you can jump off of one, do a 360 flip, and keep on going to the next ramp, jump off of that, and you can get a $20,000 bonus. 
[00:24:30]  Nice.  Yeah, you get money for the stunt bonuses.  Nice.  All right.  And also, I was wondering where I can find the tank over there in Portland.  Is it over there in Portland?  The what?  The tank.  Or do I have to wait for, like, the CIA and everybody else who's coming after me?  Oh, the tank.  And CIA. 
[00:25:00]  I thought you were saying taint.  I don't know what he was saying.  I don't know.  I'm only halfway through Staunton.  I've only had it for about a week, but I've been playing it every single night.  Yeah, it's really addicting.  It is.  All right.  Thank you, Anthony.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  One more call, and we'll take a quick break here.  Tommy, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  I beat it.  Grand Theft Auto 3?  Yeah.  You beat it?  Dude, there is nothing else to do in life when you're done with it.  I'm just waiting for four to come out now.  I have to spend time with my family and my girlfriend and stuff.  It sucks. 
[00:25:30]  It's miserable.  My friend came over.  My friend came over.  Was it Friday night?  He came over.  We went out with a couple of girls.  We came back, and he's like, you want to play the game?  I was like, yeah.  It was like two in the morning.  So we're on the mission on the short side veil.  Yeah.  And he beats the mission, and the credits came on.  I looked at him like, what did you just do?  He's like, I think you just beat it.  I was like, dude, now what are we going to do?  There's nothing else to do in life.  That's so bad.  There's that new game, Max Payne, which is out.  It sucks.  It's not as cool as this one else.  I'm not too happy with the Max Payne yet.  It's because it's a computer game.  They slammed it into a console game, and it doesn't quite work as well. 
[00:26:00]  But there's another one coming out.  I forgot the name of it.  It's by Rockstar Games, and it's cool because you're in a gang.  And I think it's coming out February 2nd.  State of Emergency.  State of Emergency, that's it, yeah.  Yeah.  It's February 2nd.  It looks cool.  I'm waiting for that one now.  All right, cool timing.  Later, guys.  Bye.  Yeah, we're meeting with the Rockstar people this week.  Yes.  We love the people from Rockstar.  Meeting with our favorite game people.  Kind of exciting, I think.  State of Emergency, the cover's hysterical.  There's just some homie G-Money guy on the cover, some big black dude, 
[00:26:30]  and just flames and pandemonium going on behind them.  That's good enough for me.  I'm sold.  Al the Cop, what's up?  What's up, guys?  What's going on?  Hey.  I got to say, all my sergeant studying time for the test is completely down the toilet  with this game.  It's unbelievable.  My favorite part thus far has been picking up the hooker, going into an alleyway and having  your health go up and your money go down.  Yeah.  When she finishes, just clock over there and take your money back.  Oh, yeah.  I learned that little trick early on in the game.  That's hilarious.  Yeah.  I figured out about two weeks.  I just hit Shoreside Vale, but I had to go back because there were a couple of the races 
[00:27:00]  that are really difficult to win.  I had to wait until I got faster cars later in the game, then I went back and got through  the stuff.  But did any of you guys get the flying code to work yet?  I cannot get the flying code to work.  I haven't tried that one yet.  Yeah, because they got planes in the hangars when you get the Shoreside Vale, but of course,  you sit there for three hours and accomplish nothing.  You know, your code doesn't work, but...  Yeah, I don't know.  Maybe someone can help us out with that.  Definitely a crack addiction, guys.  Take it easy, man.  Yeah.  Sounds like a lot of people got Grand Theft Auto 3 for Christmas. 
[00:27:30]  Look at this.  One of the screenshots from State of Emergency.  Everyone breaking into a department store, eluding it as it's in flames.  That looks cool.  Now, that looks like a fun little game to play.  And that comes out in a month?  Yeah.  You know what?  I have a feeling we might have a couple copies in our hands by Friday.  Come on, if we could get some advanced...  If that game is coming out February 2nd, and we're meeting with Rockstar Friday, it's  got to be done.  We want the advanced game.  Yeah.  I'm going to play that one. 
[00:28:00]  All right, we should take a quick break here.  Take a little break-ski.  There's a lot of pets that need to be adopted, and I'd like to talk about that when you're  back.  You dick.  Shut up, Jim.  Get with the times.  It's 2002.  Jesus.  Can't look for a hooker's 24 hours a day.  All right.  We have lots to do today.  We really do.  And good news for the fans of the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Mm-hmm.  You know, and they're going to be pissed that I say this, but I'm going to say it anyway.  Yeah.  Less commercials on the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:28:30]  Ah.  How many people are applauding and saying, finally, I'm going to have a car right now?  So, we'll be back shortly.  See?  We can say that now.  Mm-hmm.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Can I see your taint?  Nice.  Taint?  Nice.  Taint?  Nice.  Between the peach and the balloon knot.  Can we see your butt?  Nice.  I would have to just blank on your chin.  Does this guy know how to party or what?  Okay, terrific.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:29:00]  And we're back for the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Wow, that was fast.  I like the new show here.  Streamline.  Who needs that clutter?  Clutter.  Hey, did Zombie open up for Ozzy?  Yeah.  Great.  I heard Zombie kicked Ozzy's ass.  No, he certainly didn't.  Uh-oh.  Don't be saying that to Norton.  No, he did.  I watched it.  He didn't.  I've seen him before.  He did not kick.  He was good. 
[00:29:30]  And the fire was nice.  Look, we got on to something that Norton can relate to, finally.  But no, he didn't.  Look if you're defending your Ozzy.  Relax, dude.  He's 53.  He should be right now eating a peach and enjoying retirement.  But instead, he's going on at 11 o'clock.  Relax.  I think Ozzy could handle himself there, Jimmy.  Wow.  Look how excited you get.  Ben said the show sucked.  Yeah, Ben did not like the Ozzy show.  You can be honest.  No, Rob Zombie, I thought, kicked his ass. 
[00:30:00]  But when you go and see it, you know, it was cool to see Ozzy, but I just was like, whatever.  I didn't think it was that great.  My honest opinion.  I thought Rob Zombie was awesome.  I thought Ozzy, you know.  It was cool to see him, but it wasn't that great.  Rob Zombie's cute, dressed like a little caveman with a fire going all over the place.  Oh, look, more fire, hon.  Elbow, elbow.  Caveman.  Just like a caveman.  He does look like a caveman.  He does.  He kicked ass.  He's off the kick ass.  But the zombie was great.  Ozzy could follow anyone, anytime.  Yeah.  All right.  Ken from the city, real fast on the instant feedback. 
[00:30:30]  You can get to the instant feedback through opandanthony.com, by the way.  Yeah.  Hey, Ed, on Grand Theft Auto 3, do you only make right-hand turns?  Three rides, make a left-hand turn, and that's a game of fun.  I was driving up to Vermont when we were replaying the whole mother-in-law story thing.  Oh, really?  Oh, I forgot how funny that was and how uncomfortable that day was when it finally opened up.  Loft and loft.  Ah, yeah. 
[00:31:00]  Someone's going to abuse us here, I think.  TJ, what's up?  Hey, ONA.  Hey.  Happy New Year.  Welcome back.  Hey, thanks.  Hey, man.  Holy yes.  That was the quickest commercial break ever.  Really?  I swear.  It was almost, what, five, six minutes?  Yeah.  West Coast Dave is even checking in from San Francisco, saying, nice.  Nice.  It makes a world of difference.  Check out Max Payne, guys.  PS2.  I played the PC version.  I loved it.  Thought Max Payne was good, but I don't know if Stinky has a problem with it. 
[00:31:30]  I haven't played it yet.  I want to play it.  It's sweet.  It was a great game for the computer, right?  Yeah.  Uh, Stinky said it's, uh, it's, eh.  That's a Stinky, though.  Get Stinky in here.  How long did Stinky sit on that goddamn, uh, Madden 2000 football game?  Played some of the Madden 2002 over break.  That's an insane game.  Don't go wrong with the sports games.  Right.  Yeah, well, you don't like the Max Payne?  It's not that I don't like it.  I just didn't get into it that much.  Yeah.  You can just tell it's a computer game that they threw on the PlayStation.  Well, it's a little more involved. 
[00:32:00]  You've got to do a few more little things.  At least on the computer version, the controls and stuff.  Do you go to the, uh, the bullet speed?  Yeah.  It slows down.  You do some Matrix moves and stuff.  It's pretty cool.  I like that, yeah.  All right.  Let's, uh, see what Dave has.  Dave, what's going on?  Dave?  Boys, what's going on?  Hey, bro.  How are you?  Yeah, I got word, um, a friend of mine who's like the guru of gaming, that Rockstar Games  in the next four months is going to have, like, a riot game come out.  Uh, which is State of Emergency.  State of Emergency.  We were just talking about it.  Yeah.  Where have you been? 
[00:32:30]  In early February.  Oh, um, the delay is so long, you know, I'm still holding back about a few days now.  And I know how much you like EverQuest.  Yes.  This summer, there's going to be a superhero version of that game coming out.  Look, uh, that's well over my geek factor, which is already approaching critical.  Is the Superman going to be in a wheelchair?  I have no clue.  And next year, the Star Wars version comes out.  I'll stick to the version I'll play with.  Can you, can we get Stinky back in here? 
[00:33:00]  I've got to ask them something about NHL 2002.  There's a few, uh, they call them Easter eggs that you could go to on this game.  Did you play NHL 2002 with the big, retarded waterheads?  You haven't played?  I haven't played.  Oh, is that an Easter egg?  Yeah.  Well, you, you, uh, you collect points, you know, as, as you get better and better at the  game and, you know, blah, blah, blah.  And then you could, under the options, they have these Easter eggs.  So then you can play a game where everyone has just really huge, big, retarded waterheads. 
[00:33:30]  And it's really funny.  What?  You haven't gotten there yet?  You haven't gotten there yet?  Wonderful.  And then there's, uh, then there's another, uh, Easter egg.  It's called, uh, shrink and grow, I think, where your players either, either get really  small or really big, uh, uh, considering how well they're doing in the game.  Ah.  And I was playing, uh, the Flyers.  And Lindros, he scores, he becomes this monster on the ice, dude, monster on the ice, where  he's like 10 feet tall, where they're congratulating him because he just scored and, and they're like, 
[00:34:00]  they're high-fiving his knee.  That's how big he is in this game.  And I'm playing, uh, and I'm the Islanders, and Kavasha is just having a horrendous game.  He is this big.  Little tiny guy.  He is so small on the screen, you can't even see him.  He's like an ant running around.  That's ridiculous.  It's so funny, though.  You can see him smoking some of that stinky weed.  And Lindros.  In the office while they were making that game.  Let's make him small, dude, when they F up.  By the way, Lindros was still on the Flyers, but, uh, Lindros has a hat trick in the game  I'm playing.  He is, he's humongous. 
[00:34:30]  Can he actually bust out of the, uh, arena?  And I bet if you're playing with your friend, you could tease each other, like, ha, look,  my men are big and yours are small.  Shut up, Norton.  Good one.  Good one.  Just josh each other, you know, in a friendly way.  You're just jealous because you can't even turn on a computer.  Yeah.  Oh, I can, and I can go to Casa and download scat videos for hours.  Okay.  It's like.  Sean, what's going on?  I have to say that that was the shortest commercial break you guys have ever done. 
[00:35:00]  All right.  I haven't changed the station to something else in between commercials.  Ah, see?  More people listening.  You know what?  I think we're on to something.  Short of commercial breaks is a good thing.  But now I have a question for you there, Anthony.  You play EverQuest, right?  Yeah.  You ever play UO?  No.  Ultimo Online?  I can only deal with one role-playing game at a time.  Well, I'll tell you right now, this is the first ever role-playing game that I've ever seen.  That you can go to eBay, and I've seen on there a castle in the game being sold for $2,000 cash. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, even in EverQuest, they sell characters.  Like, you build up your character up to the higher levels, and then people sell their accounts for pretty big money.  I've got to go, Steve.  Ask me.  All right, man.  Incidentally, if you're caught buying a video game castle for $2,000, the government should come to your house and smother you with a pillow.  I will agree with you on that one.  Because you are a zero.  I will agree with you on that one. 
[00:36:00]  You know, you just don't like the video games.  We have to talk about video games, because Christmas just passed, and that's, like, one of the hugest...  Oh, I think Rockstar Games coming out with a stand-up comic challenge.  Oh, let's see.  Oh, damn, you got the hack.  He's going up on stage.  Stop him.  Stop him on your club.  You have to lose money.  Uh-oh, what's happening here?  I'll press this.  Oh, no, Voss is coming out on the stage.  Let's go to the old material button.  You start out as Rich Voss, and you hope to make it all the way up to, like, Jim Brewer's day. 
[00:36:30]  I have no problem with the video games.  The video games are actually up.  Well, I guess we spend enough time on the video games, eh?  Oh, sure.  I have to play in them for the whole vacation.  Hey, man, we got to back up a little bit, because you flew to Colorado.  Yeah.  Yeah, I took a couple of planes.  I am still, you know, too scared of flying myself.  That's why I decided to drive it to Vermont.  No.  I'm skiing, but you got to get back in the air, people.  How was the, you know, the obvious question, the airport security?  The airport security is tight, but I still think it's useless. 
[00:37:00]  I don't think there's anything they can do.  I think Mr. Shoebomb proved that for anybody.  Shoebomb guy, well, now, what Shoebomb guy did is now they x-ray everyone's shoes.  Everyone that's wearing boots or anything like that, they run it through the goddamn x-ray machine.  They took this right here.  They took my little sword crucifix necklace.  They should have.  That looks like a weapon.  It's, well, it's a crucifix, but it looks kind of like a sword, an upside-down sword. 
[00:37:30]  Are you leaving us to go to a renaissance festival soon?  That's where I'm going.  Excuse me, where's the bathroom?  Oh, you must want to privy.  Would I be taking a bath?  Shut up, where's the can?  Thou can.  I was walking through with my big turkey leg through security.  My rapier.  No, you know, I had a little problem with it.  But that's what it is.  They're getting a little crazy when they have to. 
[00:38:00]  I'm not criticizing it.  What else are you going to do?  It's not about making it any safer.  It's about making the people feel safer so they fly and the economy doesn't take a dump.  How about this?  No more Arabs on planes.  I like it.  How about that?  There you go.  Because it always seems they're the problem.  Sorry.  Sorry, Arab people.  Get that carpet you used to have that worked and fly that wherever you've got to go.  A bomb in the shoes.  As if Middle Eastern feet didn't smell bad enough, now the shoes are coming off in the airport. 
[00:38:30]  Can you use that joke in Philly?  That's a good one.  I might.  Funny.  You should mention Philly.  Sold out show.  Norton in Philly.  But we'll get into that another day or later tonight.  Go ahead.  Yeah, so I get through security.  And you are at their mercy.  You're not going to argue with them.  And I'm talking about normal people.  Well, they've got the SWAT teams at the airport to begin with.  There are army guys there fully armed with their rifles.  The clips are in there.  They're ready to rock, these people. 
[00:39:00]  So the intimidation factor is there.  Then you don't want to, I don't know, did you ever go in a store when you were a kid with your friends  and you're not going to steal anything, but you feel you had to walk with your arms out  and not in your pockets for fear that someone might think you're stealing something?  That's how it is now when you go through security.  It's like you don't want to eff up at all.  You feel guilty.  Like, oh, my God.  When you're being scrutinized to that point, you feel guilty.  You're like, oh, my God.  What are you doing something?  That's right, Rick.  You feel black. 
[00:39:30]  You feel like the black man feels when he walks into a Korean store.  Exactly.  I know the struggle.  So you go through the machines, everything.  I made sure I left all my change out of my pockets just so I wouldn't have to put that in the goddamn thing.  And then everyone gets checked.  Everyone gets checked.  You know you're just going to check the Arab guy.  But there are families from Nebraska, like walking through.  Okay, honey.  Well, let me take my shoes off. 
[00:40:00]  I'll put them through the x-ray machine so there's no bomb in there.  And then I watched this girl that looked like the blonde little kid from the Poltergeist movie.  She walks in.  Hot.  She walks in.  She's rotting in a grave somewhere.  Yeah, she's down.  Sick F.  Hotter than me.  She walks through.  And there's the old security guy with the metal detector.  That's a pretty little dress you got on, sweetie.  As she's going over her like she's a convict. 
[00:40:30]  And, you know, I don't think the kid's got a weapon on her.  And then you start looking around going,  I bet I can get something past this goddamn security.  Are you insane?  Well, it makes you think of the loopholes that they're leaving behind.  They check you with a metal detector.  They make you take your shoes off.  They check your feet with a metal detector.  They run your boots through the goddamn thing.  You know, I couldn't bring a crucifix shaped like a sword in. 
[00:41:00]  But I'm thinking, you know, if a woman teamed up with some guy and takes a big Kevlar shank and just shoves it right up, you know.  So, once they're on the plane, in the bathroom, what are they going to do?  And then, if that ever happens, security is going to get real interesting as we watch our loved ones being bent over and checked by an army guy.  Well, you can put the C4 up there, I bet you.  Of course.  C4. 
[00:41:30]  C8.  C6.  All of our travel is disrupted because a few savages are still being allowed to get on our planes.  Animals.  Animals.  Well, this guy, his last name was Reed, not the most Arabic name.  Yeah.  Well, he was a convert.  Some Jamaican English Muslim guy.  Who, by the way, was thrown off of planes over there in other countries.  He was thrown off the first time he tried to board an American Airlines plane in France.  And then we find out earlier in El Al flight, those Israelis don't take any crap from anyone. 
[00:42:00]  They went, look, I don't like this guy.  I don't like the looks of this guy.  You know what they did?  They sat him in the back of the plane with an armed marshal right next to him the whole flight.  And somehow we don't get info like, and this guy's allowed to just go about his business.  How about if you're that guy, you don't fly anymore?  How about now you kill him?  Are we talking about the shoe bomb guy?  Shoe bomb. 
[00:42:30]  What was his name?  Richard Reed.  Robert Reed or Richard?  Robert Reed.  Not Robert Reed.  Bobby.  No.  Bobby, Greg, where are my bomb shoes?  I thought it was David Blaine.  No.  It was Richard Reed.  Robert Reed.  Robert Reed had a different type of bomb.  That was blood splashed on you.  Oh, the Hiv bomb.  I just love the fact.  The ninja explosion.  You know something?  It's very difficult for these guys to do anything on a plane anymore, though.  That's the thing I like. 
[00:43:00]  Because when you sit in that seat now, you're flying, you have a job to do now.  It's not just going from point A to point B.  I'm looking around going, okay, if something happens now, you get a contingency plan going.  I'll deck the guy.  Because this guy, he was trying to light his shoes on fire.  And my glasses.  I know.  I have exploding shoes.  What I do, I get on the plane, and I pull the fuses out of my shoes, and I explode them  so my feet are all over, and I cut people with my broken glasses. 
[00:43:30]  But if you were on a flight and you saw a guy trying to light his shoe, you would think  he was just nuts.  No.  Not now.  See, in the older days, I'd be a flying waitress, another rum and coke.  You know what I mean?  Now, though, you've got to do something.  So when the stewardess is over there trying to do something to the guy, and it gets a  little out of hand, and now they ask the passengers, now there's five guys get up.  This guy was beaten about their head with a fire extinguisher. 
[00:44:00]  How meant is that?  Right.  They should have killed him.  How does the guy live after that?  Would you not just replay 9-11 in your head and pound the guy's face to a pulp?  Because who's going to convict you?  And the guy's got bomb shoes.  Well, he's got civil liberties, guys.  F the civil liberties of these people.  They do not have civil liberties.  They're foreign scum animals.  Another thing, since we're on that whole pack, boy, the Christmas spirit, feeling it's  alive. 
[00:44:30]  That whole India-Pakistan thing.  I know Pakistan's been, like, kind of helping us.  Sort of helping us.  Believe me, they have no choice.  They're not buddy-buddy with us.  This is something we went in and said, look, we need your real estate for some equipment.  And you're not going to say no.  Don't let anyone be fooled.  The Pakistanis don't like us any more than the Afghanis do.  Now, India, another people that are living in the Stone Age, Stone Age people with the  bomb.  Did you watch Beneath the Planet of the Apes?  Hello, it doesn't work. 
[00:45:00]  They both have the A-bomb.  I don't care.  I would not care if both these countries blew themselves off the map.  They've got the crappy little bombs.  They just take care of the one area.  And then, you wait for it to irradiate a little bit, burn a little bit there, and then we take  it over.  I've got no problem with that.  I've got no problem with nuclear war over there.  India and Pakistan.  Animals.  Thank you.  I don't mind India as much.  Why?  Because they don't cause problems for America.  I mean, they come over, they drive horribly, but, you know, they don't create terrorist acts. 
[00:45:30]  I don't have no problem with them.  Yeah?  No.  You don't, huh?  No.  I thought there was a Joe coming.  No, not at all.  But I don't care.  I couldn't do a 7-Eleven reference, so I'd have to be shocked.  Brother Joe wants in.  Brother Joe.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  I just figured I'd call and talk to Anthony for a little while.  So, I hear that there's a new song about the shoebomb.  Oh, look at Joe.  We're going to play your song, Joe.  Oh, you are?  Look at you. 
[00:46:00]  I have to.  Come on.  There have been so many that I said to.  Everybody knows me for making Patty Duke parodies.  We're going to play them.  Sorry, you've got to pump it a little bit.  Brother Joe, you've got to have faith.  Couldn't you tell we were sagging into the discussion, and then we were going to sag  into the fun song by Brother Joe?  Right.  I know, I know.  That's how we do radio.  Leave radio for the questions.  I feel like a dick.  Well, yeah.  Come on.  You know, Joe.  There were those Paul McCartney things that, oh, never mind. 
[00:46:30]  I'm hanging up.  The Opie and Anthony show is not just about plugging our own personal things.  Oh, right, Norton.  Hey, look, I didn't mention that.  Is that your New Year's resolution?  Absolutely.  Less plugs on the Opie and Anthony show?  Dude, when you mentioned Philly, did I mention that a late show had been added?  I certainly didn't.  I did not mention it.  A late show because the first one sold out.  Yeah, it's 18 and over, too, by the way, not 21.  Look, we're off the shoe bomb subject, so now we can't play Brother Joe's song because,  you know, on radio, everything has to flow nicely with sags and stuff. 
[00:47:00]  Look at the king of corn checking in from New Jersey.  There's nothing like a good old-fashioned Anthony ethnic cleansing rant.  Yeah, thanks, Hitler.  Hey, you know something?  Stop it.  I'm not being a Hitler.  That's what I'm saying.  Something else.  All I'm saying is there's a whole smorgasbord of people over there that are of the same scummy descent.  They just kind of branched off, made some lines in the sand. 
[00:47:30]  They're all the same.  Why don't they realize it?  Get together in your filthiness.  Unite in your scummy hood.  Hey, let's play Brother Joe's song.  All right.  It's the shoe bomb song?  It's the shoe bomber song.  I haven't heard this one yet.  You haven't?  No.  Boy, everyone was working while we were away.  But it's still a mess in here.  Is it A or B?  It's this twisty thing.  I don't know.  It's the twisty thing today.  It's something new.  The little twisty thing.  Ooh.  All right. 
[00:48:00]  Here's our Brother Joe song.  Can I use a quad with a picture of an A?  All alone inside the friggin' place.  Oh, life would be a dream.  If I was only in that airplane high above.  Shoe bomb.  I'd beat your head until your ears were spewing blood.  Shoe bomb would be a drum.  We talk.  Send you out, gotta send.  Shoe bomb.  I'd come back on your feet again.  Oh, life could be a dream.  Shoe bomb.  If I could dress you in a white sheet and a hood.  Shoe bomb.  I'd strap you up in Harlem. 
[00:48:30]  It would feel so good.  Shoe bomb.  It'd be a dream.  We talk.  Hey.  Now, every time I see your face,  I thought it was through my mind.  Oh, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma.  Take this to Shoe bomb.  You shall love your d***.  Oh, life would be a dream.  Shoe bomb.  If I could only get your shoes,  I'd make a bitch.  Shoe bomb.  Just put down on your mom and get an ace and bitch. 
[00:49:00]  Shoe bomb.  Shoe bomb.  Retire.  Shoe bomb.  Shoe bomb.  Your mommy, your mommy, your mommy, your mommy, your mommy, your mommy, your mommy.  Shoe bomb.  Shoe bomb.  Your mommy, your mommy, your mommy, your mommy, your mommy.  Shoe bomb.  Shoe bomb.  Your mommy, your mommy, your mommy, your mommy, your mommy, your mommy, your mommy.  Shoe bomb.  All right, brother Joe, we get it. 
[00:49:30]  That's the shoe bomb guy's mom.  I understand.  Sounds like someone got a new microphone for Christmas.  Yeah, look at that.  There you go.  There you go, Joe. 
[00:50:00]  Good job, Joe.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, give us a call, 877-877-877.  Can we put the numbers back to how they used to be?  Yeah.  That is stupid.  It's distracting.  Anywhere else outside New York, it's 866-2774.  Wow.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  How old are you?  18.  All right.  What are you showing up?  Wow.  I'm building this.  Well.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:50:30]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show, The Strokes.  Last night, I want to say hi to everyone in Boston.  Actually, outside the WBCN studios.  There's a bunch of sick bastards every Wednesday in Boston.  They hang outside the WBCN studios at the Wow Signs.  Yes.  Hoping for girls to flash in as they drive by, you know, the studio on Boylston there.  Right. 
[00:51:00]  It's freezing today, and they're out there once again.  Very dedicated to the radio show.  We like seeing that.  Yes.  Throw them around.  Got a lot of distracted there, sorry.  I know.  We're going to talk about Tyson in a little bit here.  But I've got to ask Ed how his New Year's was.  Oh, very, very nice.  Let me go to Sergio.  Sergio, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey. 
[00:51:30]  Yo, how was Anthony's party crashing on New Year's?  Yeah, I kind of, I came in here.  See, that's what I got distracted.  I mean, the phone's going crazy.  It seems like you created kind of a scene here.  No, I was having fun.  Did you lose your car keys or something?  No, I didn't have the keys to the office.  Oh, someone's saying all the booze was in there.  I break aunt's balls about forgetting his keys on New Year's.  Yeah, so I had to, you know, kind of find an alternate means of getting into the office.  But I found it. 
[00:52:00]  Everyone thinks I was so sly.  Our own Garrett is stinking.  If you look in his mailbox, there was the key to the office.  No big deal.  I opened it with a key.  It's pretty easy.  Did you check out the ball drop from the top of this building?  Yes, I did.  Eddie Trunk was here, as he does on Friday and Saturday nights.  He plays the hard rock show.  The only music left here on NEW.  And he was doing the New Year's Eve show.  So we came into the city. 
[00:52:30]  Staying at the hotel.  And I like being here in Manhattan.  New Year's Eve.  I like watching Times Square.  Not on TV.  Something happens, I'm going to be here.  Are you insane?  What the hell's loot?  Why?  You think you're going to see the big white flash?  Who knows, but it was the last place I wanted to be.  Nah.  I was at Betty Hunnis, Anthony.  Oh, Jesus.  I just love how the cook, you know, flips the shrimp into his pocket while he's cooking.  You ever see him put it in his hat?  Huddle, huddle. 
[00:53:00]  Well, as a matter of fact...  Puts it right into his hat.  As a matter of fact, I did.  Everyone around the table laughs.  As a matter of fact, I did see that, and I was pretty entertained.  Did he work the big salt and wood salt and pepper shakers like Nunchuk?  Oh, yeah.  Just cook, Wang.  I'm hungry over here.  I didn't come for the show.  I wanted to say hi to Benny, but I hear he's in jail or something.  Benny Hanna is in jail?  That's what I heard.  Yeah?  I don't know that.  Some bad business practices or something, or bad stock or something was going on. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, there's strings attached to those.  I guess it's not cool to yell out Benny Hanna's name in the middle of the restaurant.  No?  No, I learned that.  Was it someone's birthday?  Did they go, bonsai, behind them?  Mr. Bonsai?  Oh, yeah.  That's too bad.  But you were on the top of the building.  Yeah, yeah.  I thought this city was locked down, and you're going on to the top of the building?  Let me tell you something.  The city was completely locked down.  Every road, coming into the city, patrolled, between 5th and 8th, was closed all the way 
[00:54:00]  from below Times Square up to the park, just about.  15 West, was it?  Yeah.  And we came in, and I wanted to see Times Square.  I wanted to see, and I have a vantage point of Times Square.  So, a couple of years back, I crashed a party upstairs.  Going upstairs, I went floor by floor.  There are 44 floors in this building, I think.  Did you find a party this year?  No parties.  So, now I'm like, damn, I need a window. 
[00:54:30]  So, I went up to the roof.  I'm crawling around all the equipment up there on the roof, and the furthest corner away,  there was an opening about a foot wide, because they had a big wall around the roof.  You can't just walk off the roof.  There's a huge wall there.  And I found an opening.  Looked directly down 7th Avenue, right to Times Square.  So, I had the perfect vantage point.  A perfect perch.  Well, you know, again, the sick mind gets thinking. 
[00:55:00]  I'm like, there are helicopters.  Lee Harvey Oswald would have been proud of the location you found.  There were helicopters everywhere.  Believe me.  Everywhere.  Searchlights combing the rooftops.  And I'm in a corner going, I had no problem getting up here.  I don't even have a building ID, for God's sake.  And, yeah, I could have taken pot shots at the crowd with any type of rifle.  That I wanted to bring with me in a bag or something. 
[00:55:30]  Awful.  Sick that you're even thinking this way.  I was thinking of it as a way to protect people.  I'm thinking, well, how the hell is it?  I said, how the hell is it?  How do you turn that one around?  I was thinking, how is it that I'm up here?  I was like, how is it that I am up here with a complete view of all the people crowding 7th Avenue?  Yo, you just flipped it all the way down to Times Square.  He just flipped it.  I saw the ball drop, everything.  And I had a perfect pitch black vantage point of that road. 
[00:56:00]  And you couldn't take out Dick Clark for us.  I didn't have a weapon.  I told you.  I didn't have a weapon.  But I'm thinking, if somebody had something, and they could get up here, it's going to be trouble.  Imagine if you had a rifle named Charlene, what you could have done with it.  Charlene.  Charlene.  Jesus.  Name Charlene.  Charlene.  It was pretty sick.  Danny, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, man. 
[00:56:30]  Danny's in, oh, you're in Boston in front of WBCN?  Yeah, right now.  You're one of the sick Fs that hang out there every Wednesday?  Yeah, we're the ones that go every Wednesday.  We've got the sign stickers.  We're paying out CDs right now.  There's three of us right now.  That's cool.  You guys have been hanging out there every Wednesday since we broadcasted from Boston.  Yep, every Wednesday.  Every Wednesday.  Are you seeing anything today?  No, you need to say something on the radio.  Let's get some stuff.  Let's get some girls down here.  All right.  Well, it's on Boylston there.  They'll see you.  You got your signs and stuff. 
[00:57:00]  Thank you, Danny.  You thought I was lying.  And there they are.  I know.  They're there all the time.  Psycho Mark.  Mark.  Happy F-a-new-ya.  What's up, Psycho?  Hey, Anthony, did you notice in Times Square, there's tons more hookers now?  Oh, my God.  Mark, are you okay?  No, I'm serious.  But, like, I saw Tom Brogard and each one of the media tents there.  They were celebrating because Giuliani's gone, you know?  You sound hammered.  I got the day off. 
[00:57:30]  No, it's the day after New Year's, and it's four o'clock in the afternoon, or thereabouts,  and you're hammered.  No.  Well, not entirely.  I don't like that.  Did you talk to your doctor?  I'm staggered here.  No, I didn't.  How was your New Year's, man?  Oh, dude, I wanted to punch people left and right. 
[00:58:00]  I had to hold the transmitter.  I thought, fucks.  Fucks.  Over my head.  Yeah?  It's too close to your head.  It starts getting really, really warm.  Hey, what, um...  Oh, God, I can't remember what I was going to ask him.  On the O'Reilly thing, maybe?  Yeah, but what about everybody going from CNN over to Fox there, Mark?  Everyone's, I don't know, dollars a talk, and I don't have that power.  You see that now, Greta Van Susteren?  Greta Van Susteren.  She went over to Fox now.  What a looker. 
[00:58:30]  Why did Fox offer the pay to have that stroke mouth?  God damn.  Hey, is O'Reilly going to give Sean Penn the business tonight on the O'Reilly Factor?  I don't know.  I don't have to tune in.  I'm not there.  I really don't.  He knows nothing about what goes on at Fox.  I don't know.  I'm hammered.  I was hammered.  I was hammered.  I had to work.  Get the transmitter up.  Oh, God.  People were such morons, too, at Times Square.  They're all, you know, what are you doing?  I'm standing here with a transmitter talking to Martians. 
[00:59:00]  What do you think I'm doing?  You effing tool.  Go back to your cave.  All right, there on Psycho, Mark.  You're pretty ripped.  I'm ripped.  Why did you see Tyson?  At least I'm not chucking, whatchamacallit, around the hotel lobby.  Christmas balls.  Crystal balls.  I'm hocking crystal balls, you.  Hey, I wouldn't talk.  I heard your message.  You left for Ben, you racist.  Hey, hey, hey.  Oh, dear. 
[00:59:30]  You should not leave things like that on recording.  You're insane.  I care.  Whatever.  Let me tell you what the kicker was after his whole rant.  He goes, typical black.  You are horrid.  Hey, I grew up in Southie a part time.  All right, Mark.  See you later.  Later.  There you go.  Psycho, Mark.  Gack, gack, gack.  While I was up on the roof checking out the Times Square for the news, I went around to  the park side, and I'm going, yeah, I think Ope could hit that. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, you did?  I think you could do that.  Yeah.  You took a look, right?  You took a look, and you could absolutely send a golf ball flying with a driver.  Where am I going to hit it from?  Do I have to climb up that little metal staircase?  That's what I'm thinking.  Oh, God.  There's the wall in the way.  That's my own problem.  A little obstacle there.  Yeah, that would be trouble.  If you could get up on top of the roof of the machine, all the elevator motors and stuff,  you get up there, you got it. 
[01:00:30]  And I don't even think it's much of a hazard.  I'm looking out going, that's what I mean.  Because especially in the winter, this is the tallest building in the area.  Yeah.  You could slam that thing, and you would make it well into Central Park.  You don't even have to worry about clearing the streets.  How many yards do you think it is?  It's nothing.  I don't even think it's 200.  It's got to be at least 200.  I don't think so.  You take a look.  I look, I'm like, that's close, man, real close.  Cool.  Yeah.  We'll have to try that.  All right.  Let me go to Doug from Springfield.  Doug, what's up?  I think Anthony just came up with a new video game. 
[01:01:00]  Huh?  Got him being a sniper on top of the building door on New Year's Eve.  Wiggles way up.  He had little, like, things getting the right shooting at him.  We'll be able to duck him.  I just don't think there should have been a way to get that much of a secluded vantage point on...  Well, they can't check every nook and cranny in all of Midtown.  You know what?  They could have put people, cops, on every room.  At least at every building, lobby. 
[01:01:30]  So if I decided I was going to go and take the elevator up to the 44th floor at a quarter to 12,  maybe you'd ask me where I'm going, what I'm doing.  You know what I mean?  With Earl on sniper watch?  Go F yourself.  We had to call up Earl.  We had to call up Earl and, like, beg him to come down here.  He's like, what are you doing?  Oh, just sitting at home.  It's New Year's Eve.  Why do you need him here at New Year's Eve?  Ah, you know how it is.  You get a few in you, and you want to be festive. 
[01:02:00]  You don't want somebody sitting home alone.  You just wanted Earl down at the station.  No.  I actually had to call him up.  I was like, why don't you come down?  So I go, let's talk to him.  He won't come.  He won't leave his house.  It's like, Earl, what are you doing?  It's New Year's Eve.  Come on down.  I've got to work at 10 in the morning.  I'm like, yeah.  Where do you work?  Here.  So come down here.  You're at work.  Saves you the trip.  Okay, damn it.  You talked me into it.  It's like, oh.  Woo. 
[01:02:30]  Eddie Trunk is on the line here.  Eddie, what's up?  Eddie.  Eddie.  Yo.  What's up, Eddie?  What's up, guys?  Hello, Eddie.  A lot of fun.  A lot of fun, New Year's Eve, Eddie.  Yeah, it was a good time hanging out, man.  Hey, I don't know.  I just tuned in, so I don't know if you guys talked about this,  but the greatest thing that we did on New Year's Eve  is when Anthony went at the top of the building  and called in his report.  Yeah.  We forgot to go out of delay.  Yeah, so I had the countdown eight seconds  after New Year's Eve, everybody got to hear it. 
[01:03:00]  And there it is.  Five, four.  And meanwhile, everyone's...  And, of course, everybody listening  had to call in and tell us that, you know,  I only go down to eight when I'm on,  and everybody had to call in and remind us  that we were eight seconds off  like a bunch of idiots in the studio.  Yeah.  That's funny.  And he holds the cell phone out,  and he goes, I'm listening on the drive-by.  Yeah, yeah.  And he goes, all right, you're going to hear them go nuts.  And he holds the cell phone.  Nothing, right?  And I go, well, I'm here in the stratosphere.  Maybe that's why. 
[01:03:30]  It would have been more climactic  if you played the death scene from Beaches.  There was nothing going on.  Oh, silence.  Yeah, well, I saw him.  Hey, Ed, did you question Stinky about the booze?  Yeah, earlier, I did.  Okay.  He's responsible for taking a lot of the drink  out of their emphasis.  That's okay, though.  He's a good egg.  You didn't look all too happy  when you had to come in with brown bags  from the deli at $14 a six-pack. 
[01:04:00]  No, I stole those from our office.  Oh, okay.  I thought you went outside.  Yeah, the fine folks.  Who sent that, Rick?  Mike's Hard Lemonade.  Mike's Hard Lemonade sent boxes full of that stuff.  And I just kind of made it find its way back here.  Had a good time.  Well, guys, I'm happy, man.  It was a good time, man.  All right, man.  See you guys.  Eddie Chuck, everyone.  Yeah.  Played a lot of Sabbath that night for me.  Eddie Chuck.  Oh, yeah.  Finest music show anywhere.  That was a lot of fun.  Did you guys all discuss your New Year's resolutions?  No.  Resolutions.  I don't believe it.  What a joke that is. 
[01:04:30]  I'm going to exercise more.  How about you?  High five.  Yeah, that.  I'm not going to eat chocolate.  Yeah.  I'm going to quit smoking.  Look, it's $11.59.  Here's my last puff.  Shut up.  I hope that's the one that kills you.  New Year's resolutions never work.  Never.  You know who gives New Year's resolutions?  Even the ones that really give it the effort by March.  It's all over.  Gone.  Gone.  You know who the type of people that do the New Year's resolutions are?  And I promise not to beat you no more, baby.  That's my resolution.  I won't beat you no more. 
[01:05:00]  You're such a good man.  And fat women.  Ah.  You ever see the, like, Pittsburgh-type fat women with almost mullets and the stretch pants  and the big white socks pulled over them?  They always make resolution.  They're going to lose weight and become real people.  And they just bunt.  Yeah, exactly.  Bunt in the front.  And they try to camouflage it with a longer sweater.  So, you know, it's the stretch pants, yeah.  And it's the stretchy bicycling pants. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, they got that lousy, greasy hair because they're too lazy to shower and that scrunchy.  And an odor between their legs that smells like the foreskin of a hyena.  Yeah.  God damn, does that conjure up an image.  Oh, you wrote material over the holiday.  So how is Lady Dime?  How is Lady Dime?  How are you?  How are you?  Hey, they're talking about me.  How are you?  You know what's even worse than making the New Year's resolution, though?  Being part of the polar bear club. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, another bunch of jerk-offs.  How many?  Oh, it's so wild.  Look how wild they are running into the ocean.  New Year's Day.  New Year's Day.  I bet that's cold.  They jump right back out.  Here's a towel.  Here you go.  Wrap up.  You did it.  You're in.  You're in.  The younger ones, you know, looking up to the elders with respect.  Look, I'm in.  I did it.  All looking at each other's shrinkage through their tight little Euro swimsuits. 
[01:06:30]  But the news...  Look how little yours is.  A mere nugget.  The news stations, they got it covered every year.  Oh, they cover it.  We've seen it.  Just show the footage from last year.  It's the same goddamn thing.  That's wonderful.  You know when that would be great?  If you get, like, an invalid and you just push him in his wheelchair into the freezing water.  And then you harpoon him.  And then here it is, the oldest member of the polar bear.  96 years old.  There he is. 
[01:07:00]  Head comes out of the water.  His gray hair flops over to the side.  Shaking.  All you see is that transparent skin with a few blood vessels pumping blood.  Naughty elbows.  He's shivering and shaking.  Naughty elbows.  His heart's saying, I'll give you one more chance.  One more.  You do this again, you're dead.  The polar bear club.  Awful.  They're right here in New York.  They do it everywhere. 
[01:07:30]  Don't they do it out on Coney Island?  I believe that's where they do it.  There's a Boston chapter.  If you've got water and it's cold, you've got a polar bear club.  That's great.  What, do they just jump in and they jump out?  Yeah.  That's it.  What, are they going to stay in there?  It's called exposure.  You die.  It's called stupid.  All right.  Let's check out the FU line.  We've got a bunch of things to get into today.  There's a great story.  I know the Tyson story is really good.  Yeah.  But it was the day after we left for the Christmas vacation. 
[01:08:00]  Muhammad Ali telling the jokes.  Muhammad Ali.  If you haven't heard this story yet, you've got to stick around, okay?  Yeah.  Here's the FU line.  Let's see what's going on.  Hey, thanks for calling.  And here's the Opie to Anthony FU line.  Yeah.  I just want to say, f*** you to Muhammad Ali for telling that racist joke.

Thanks for the $25.  F*** you.  Next message.  I would like to give a big f*** you to my dad for taking my bong and then having me find it a week later.  F*** you.

[01:10:30]  Dave from Jersey writes, no matter how much you guys make fun of black people, we've always  got that polar bear crap on you crackers.  Yeah, that's true.  Dave from Hoboken, the worst New Year's story every year are the stupid fights the hospitals  have over who is the New Year's baby.  And we'll let you know who the New Year's baby is.  And how about this, if you can't decide, you smother the two high contestants and give 
[01:11:00]  us the third chance.  Oh, my God.  And the hooked end of the hanger doesn't count.  And Rick from Boston writes, oldest polar bear club member, remember, the news reporters  always say he's 98 years young.  Oh, 98 years young.  I don't think so.  Yeah, they are.  Oh, baby, it's a tie.  Yeah, yeah, two infants ushering New Year at midnight.  The young Asian couple.  I see. 
[01:11:30]  Zhijian, Yongchen, and hubbies, I'm in key.  Well, then that couple's baby doesn't count because they have a whole different New Year's  thing, right?  Hold their daughter, Nikki.  Don't they celebrate New Year's like in the middle of August or something, don't they?  Some awful time.  Hubbies, I don't even know what their last name is.  The proud parent, Jian, Yong, Chen, and hubby, Zio, Min, QE. 
[01:12:00]  Well, what the hell?  And the daughter, Nikki.  Nikki.  And then what's the, uh...  Did they have twins or is there someone else?  It's like I care, but...  We've spent too much time on it.  Who cares?  Right?  Sarah Chah and her husband, Jason Kemp.  And there's a conspiracy here.  What the hell is this with the midnight Asian babies?  All Asians.  And the conceptions were actually in December.  They pump them out quick, Asian babies.  Maybe that's it.  Jeez!  What's going on? 
[01:12:30]  Hey, John.  Hey.  What's up, bro?  I wanted to ask Norton, where's the good Bardello out in Vegas?  Um, you know what, dude?  I've been to Vegas many times, and I've never gone to a brothel.  I always use the, uh...  Don't even use the phone book.  Use the, like, little local papers and look for girls back there.  Because they're not going to give you full prices.  And be careful about giving out your room.  They're just going to send a chick up.  They won't give you a full service price most times.  They'll say, all right, it's $150.  But that's just for her to show up.  So make sure that you say you want to know a full service price. 
[01:13:00]  Full service price is probably a lot.  Yeah, dude, I've never been to a brothel out there, though.  I'm afraid of brothels because they get raided.  Hey, thanks.  Even out there?  I don't know about that.  I just don't go...  I don't go...  It's not legal in Vegas, I thought.  It's outside the city limits.  In Vegas, which is, uh...  I forget the name of the county.  It's, uh...  Oh, God.  They're really rough, too.  It's not, uh...  Clark County.  It's not legal.  Well, well...  What?  You like your prostitution here is legal?  No, but Vegas is...  I'm saying outside the city, uh...  County limits, I believe. 
[01:13:30]  Legal.  It's legal.  All right, John.  Thank you.  You stink.  Sorry, dude.  I don't know why he is.  Yeah, Mark, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  What's going on, guys?  Been a big fan for a long time.  Oh, thank you.  Um, I gotta commend you guys on a new commercial situation, you know, cutting down on the length  of the brakes.  We're trying.  Um, you know, usually if I mess up at work, reaching for the knob to change the station  or whatever, but, uh...  Who the heck sells airtime?  Uh, I don't know.  Um, basically, uh...  You guys play the same commercials over and over and over again for, like... 
[01:14:00]  Oh, man.  New year, new products on the way.  Yes.  Well, I hope so.  I keep hearing the same...  I'm still reaching for the knob and changing the station, because I've got to hear that,  uh...  What's that one about to get in your, uh, schlong longer?  Logitude.  Logitude.  Come on.  Over and over and over.  It's driving me nuts.  Well, your options are to take longitude and get a bigger schlong, or just dump your girlfriend  and find one that isn't a whore.  Yes, there you go.  Norton, you dick-ass.  I'm actually glad I got called in and get ranked on by Norton.  You know, I want to talk to, uh, uh, Tim Sabian in Philadelphia, Anthony. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, why?  When is his friend, uh, going to start advertising on our show?  With the stuff that makes your stuff, uh, taste better.  Right.  What the hell product is that?  You take these pills, and, uh, when the, uh, girl is doing the, uh, doing the deed to  you, and you finish, the resulting finished product tastes like fruit flavors.  Like cherry.  Or it could be banana.  Or maybe a little mint.  What's the matter?  I don't like it.  A little skeptical? 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, it takes the degradation and tears out of it.  Sometimes you want to hear,  Why?  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  I don't want them enjoying it like a dackery.  I didn't spend $400 on a handgun for nothing.  That's dackery.  What's that sound again?  Let me hear that.  Get out of the car, bleach breath. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, man.  Yeah, it's, uh, fruity flavors.  Could be peach, banana.  Will you redo that joke for Philadelphia when you're there?  January 25th for two shows?  Well, the first one sold out, but the 11 is still available at Ticketmaster.  I don't remember the number.  I suck.  20, 5, 3, 3, 6.  2,000.  What a shock written down here. 
[01:16:00]  Fruity flavors.  Fruity flavors.  What's the advantage in fruity flavors?  You know, younger girls can enjoy it, too.  Like a sippy drink.  They sure like the taste.  All right, well.  So we're looking forward to the new products.  They're coming.  Jermaine from Philadelphia.  Yeah, we wanted to talk about this.  He writes on the Instant Feedback.  Guys, local news here today reported.  George Lucas has agreed to let NSYNC make a cameo in Star Wars, the movie that's coming out in the summer there, the next one there. 
[01:16:30]  They're going to be killed off by drones quickly, all because his little bitch daughters love NSYNC.  This is...  NSYNC will be in the next Star Wars movie.  You know, could George Lucas please just sell the franchise to somebody?  Sell it to somebody with a vision?  Maybe what it was supposed to turn into?  And everyone that got psyched about, oh, good, three movies is a prequel to the first three. 
[01:17:00]  You should have seen what was going to happen because of that last one with those stuffed animals running around.  All of a sudden, you know, he's a daddy, he's got the kids.  I love NSYNC.  You know, bring him over your house so your little daughter can perform oral favors on him and leave him out of the goddamn movie.  Yeah, there it is.  It seems George Lucas is...  It's tearing up my heart when I'm with you. 
[01:17:30]  But when we are apart, I feel it's true.  This is Drake in Star Wars.  And no matter what I do, I feel okay.  They get blown up by battle droids.  Give me.  Yeah, shut up.  Shut up.  I cannot honestly see this movie now. 
[01:18:00]  Could somebody smack me if I do go see it?  I got a whole...  They're going to be just in the background real fast, Anthony.  Really quick.  Great.  You'll barely know they're there.  It's an abomination.  Why'd you see The Phantom Menace?  I wouldn't go see that crap.  You just didn't say it?  Absolutely not.  You have to at least go see it.  No, no.  You know something?  You're right, Norton.  I'm tired of the faggot marketing.  You saw it in a kid movie.  And stuffed animals.  Enough.  It was a kid movie. 
[01:18:30]  I learned after the third one.  You didn't enjoy the Jar Jar there?  I wouldn't know.  Wouldn't know Jar Jar Bates.  Jar Jar.  Who, by the way, is coming back in this next episode.  A little bit.  Not as much.  Well, you know something?  His scene better be him dying.  Maybe they'll put that in a DVD with Lord of the Rings.  It will come with a mule to rub on someone's face and cheeks.  Why would adults see this crap?  It's a Hobbit movie.  Rick liked Lord of the Rings. 
[01:19:00]  You didn't like Lord of the Rings?  No, I wouldn't know.  Is it out?  I didn't see it.  No.  Do you go to the movies?  I know it.  It rocks.  What do you do when you're not doing radio stand-up or looking for hookers?  It's a lot of time open.  Yeah.  24 hours in a day.  Do you go to movies?  I haven't.  No.  I actually don't.  What was the last movie you saw?  To be honest with you, I saw one thing.  Oh, Man on the Moon, which I loved.  Last thing.  I don't go to the movies.  Man on the Moon came out 2.  Oh, my God.  2?  I think it's longer.  2.  I saw Titanic in the theater.  It was revolting. 
[01:19:30]  I wanted to see it on the screen for the grabbers.  And I saw, what was the one with Sandra Bullock and Matthew McConaughey?  And this is why I saw the John Grisham movie.  The first one.  The Time to Kill.  Yeah, sure.  And it sucked so bad.  I almost started.  The only reason I didn't boo in the movie theater.  I mean, boo!  Was because there was a guy with his kids there, and I didn't want to ruin it for them.  Boo!  And I'm walking out, and there's two comedians I saw with, and they're in the front.  I'm like, as soon as it's over, I'm like, dude, didn't that suck? 
[01:20:00]  And they're like, no, we thought it was really good.  I'm like, no wonder you're both effing hats.  And I can't go to the movies anymore.  I did the same thing with Mummy Returns.  I was so pissed at the screen, how bad that movie was.  Why are we here?  This stinks.  They wrecked a good franchise.  That and Tomb Raider.  I wouldn't have seen that.  I just, I don't go.  Unless it looks really great.  That's wild.  Gee, I'm just looking at the latest pictures of the Olsen twins.  Wow.  Well, you know something, I didn't start this here. 
[01:20:30]  I've got to blame Jay from Jersey.  He goes, holy ass, I just saw a commercial for the all-new episodes of the Olsen twins show,  So Little Time.  And these, he's calling them the TWA word, are the hottest little things out there.  Screw the age limits.  This is legal, isn't it?  Look, look at, I got to, look at what they're looking like.  Just stop it.  They're dressing like they're 20 years old.  Yeah, now they're looking like, like hot girls. 
[01:21:00]  Look at this, they're all wet.  Man.  How old are they now?  Like 10 years old.  They're at least 15?  I think their birthday's coming up, isn't it?  I think in April.  Yeah, April they'll be 16.  I think they'll be 16, which is just fair game.  John, what's going on?  Listen, that NSYNC rumor was almost as bad as back in the day when there was a rumor that  Eddie Murphy was going to be in Star Trek IV.  Could you imagine Kirk and Eddie Murphy in the same movie? 
[01:21:30]  No.  I mean, when my Trekkie friends heard that, they were like, oh, that's impossible, that  can't be real.  But of course there's a rumor, but that can't be as bad as the NSYNC in the next Star Wars  movie, though, you know?  Well, NSYNC will be in the next Star Wars movie.  It's being reported as a real story.  Yeah.  Correct.  Oh, God.  All right, man.  Eric, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, boys.  Glad to hear you back.  Cool.  Listen, I think George Lucas is trying to reach another demographic, like Gay Marco  and Rick.  I mean, because, you know.  There's Rick in there.  Maybe they can have the bend over Jar Jar toy for them. 
[01:22:00]  I don't know.  Later, boys.  All right.  Okay.  Tyson, Anthony.  You're still looking at those pictures?  No, no.  I'm done.  Oh, damn.  I finished.  Now, what's the latest with Tyson?  He was in Cuba.  He was in Cuba, and he got in a little fight in a hotel lobby with reporters, right?  Yeah.  Let's see.  Havana.  Mike Tyson checked out of a Havana hotel early Wednesday, a day after witnesses said 
[01:22:30]  he shouted at and tossed glass Christmas ornaments at journalists trying to interview him.  There were no reports of injuries, arrests, or serious damage.  That's always good, right?  He didn't have feces to flim.  Tyson wearing jeans, but no top, raised his fist in a threatening gesture and yelled insults.  Tyson lightly hit a cameraman on the head?  How do you, how does Tyson lightly hit somebody? 
[01:23:00]  I lightly hit you.  He just went crazy, said the cameraman.  Of course he did.  I was planning to ask him for an interview, but he never let me speak.  He just turned on us.  He turned on us.  People don't turn on you.  What does that say?  And then they said Tyson grabbed a few large glass balls from the Christmas tree near the entrance  and lobbed them at the reporters who left shortly afterward.  He just started throwing Christmas ornaments.  Classic.  I didn't get no Zolo for the holidays, so I had to throw the crystal balls. 
[01:23:30]  Lightly punching.  Lightly punching.  Hey, look, I'm going to give you a love tap.  That guy's probably completely brain damaged right now.  I'm in Cuba.  Look.  Baba Lou.  Baba Lou.  Hi, yeah.  Look, he's on the back of the cameraman's head.  Hey, Ricky Ricardo, come here.  Shut up, Lucy. 
[01:24:00]  Look, I'm beating up your hubby.  Hey, look.  Hey, look.  Hey, look, I'm beating up your hubby.  Hey, look.  Hey, look.  Hey, look.  Hey, look.  Look, I'm beating up your hubby.  Hey, look.  Hey, look.  Hey, look.  Hey, look.  I got more irritated as the day went on.  Irritated.  Y to Z.  Irritated.  That's a quick one.  He just went crazy.  Planning to ask him an interview.  He just turns on.  Maybe he was looking for a cash truck.  People of Cuba, I have come to your country. 
[01:24:30]  I am a conqueror.  Your leader, Fidel, is a pussy.  Look, I can kick his ass.  Look, I'm going to go see the American troops at Guantanamo Bay.  Guantanamo.  C-R-Tanamo.  T-O.  I'll spell that later.  First, I'm going to lightly, lightly pat the maid on the head. 
[01:25:00]  Why'd she fall down so fast?  Housekeeping!  Housekeeping!  Bitch.  Come here and clean my room.  There's blood on the walls, mate.  Cuban blood.  John, what's going on?  I like that.  Lightly hit him in the back of the head.  Tyson lightly hitting you in the back of the head would be like me getting a running start and clubbing you with a two-by-four. 
[01:25:30]  Exactly.  He don't hit anything lightly.  The man that punches tigers in the nuts for fun.  That's right.  That's what I do for fun.  I have tigers at my house.  And I punch them in the testicles because they enjoy the fight.  It's a love tap.  I'm glad you guys made it back.  Happy New Year.  Thank you, John.  It's like I treat my bitches with love taps.  I get them on the bed after luring them into the hotel room.  I mean inviting them up into my hotel room under the guise of just maybe hanging out with a celebrity like me. 
[01:26:00]  And then I take my huge mitt and I brush it down their hair.  I'm very romantic.  I go romantic.  R-T-R-C-2.  And as I'm brushing, I lightly brush the hair because I'm sensitive, Mike.  And then sometimes I like.  You ever see how it got my couple girls' face and slowly like pat her cheek? 
[01:26:30]  That's what I do.  I do that.  Why is she bleeding?  Then while she's regaining consciousness, I make sure right when her eyes open, all she sees is Mike Tyson's face.  Right there.  And I give her the same look.  Remember the way King Kong looked at Fay Wray with the big smile?  What did she say?  That's right.  And the girl said the same thing with Mike in the hotel room. 
[01:27:00]  Then I slowly like to run my hand up her leg.  And if she wears a dress, I get to the panties and I start pulling them off.  And that's where I cross off into Felonius' song.  How do you spell Felonius?  Um, my Felonius has a first name.  I don't know, but I love their bologna. 
[01:27:30]  That was good.  The Christmas ornaments I was throwing, it was very difficult to get up to the top one because it was a big tree.  So I started climbing it and biplanes started shooting at me.  But I got to the start and I threw it at a reporter.  And then I said, I'm only kidding.  I patted them on the head.  What is this gray stuff coming out of your ears?  Hey, Sam, what's going on?  Uh, not much, man.  Just, uh... 
[01:28:00]  Hold on.  Let me set this up.  You work for Maxim Magazine?  Um, I was assisting a photographer that shot, uh, the photos for Maxim Magazine.  We talked about the Maxim Magazine, um, uh, interview with Mike Tyson.  You were there in Vegas when they went down?  Yeah, we were hanging out with him for about three hours, four days.  That's what I, that's when I took the guy that was doing the interview.  And I like to do this as a trick.  I pick up a fork off the table, right?  And then I go, ah!  And I make it like I'm biting the back of his neck.  And I poke him with the fork. 
[01:28:30]  And he usually relieves himself in his pants.  Yeah, he came pretty close to relieving himself, yeah.  He's evacuated.  L, B, 2, Y, and then the symbol for boron.  That was, that was an answer to, uh, his probing questions about, uh, what jail life was like.  And, uh...  Yeah, I don't like being talked about, uh, when they talk about the jail.  No, no, he, he didn't like that at all.  It hurts me, the pain, uh, that when I think about being in jail and, uh, the pain of all those men's buttocks that I invaded, 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  I feel guilty till I take the Zoloft and I don't care no more.  Sam?  The best, the best thing of the, uh, the whole four days was, um, it wasn't actually reported in the article.  We were standing outside this, uh, this dodgy, uh, strip mall just outside of Vegas.  And, uh, we'd just been eating, uh, chicken wings, which Mike, uh, took about three minutes to devour.  Uh-uh.  But, uh...  I'd take mine with fetters. 
[01:29:30]  We're standing out, we're standing outside this, uh, this strip mall and this little, just like 50-year-old black kid comes up to Tyson.  They're kind of like, do the whole, uh, black handshake, hugging each other thing.  And, uh, he kind of leans over and he starts poking in Tyson's ear and Tyson kind of takes a step back and he goes,  Yo, man, can't you see I'm with, uh, those Caucasians?  They're with me, man.  I'm taking care of business.  I'm sorry.  What are you cursing for?  Hey, Sam.  Yeah.  When you're telling these little stories, have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listeners. 
[01:30:00]  You may, uh, take a fine photograph, but you suck on the radio.  I'm sorry.  You're the worst.  God.  Did Tyson hit you in the head?  Um, no, I...  I work him like a body bag.  Anything else you want to add, Sam?  Um, yeah, the article definitely didn't do the, uh, four days justice. 
[01:30:30]  It was an awesome experience.  Uh, he, he, he definitely was on his own because he was, he was very relaxed except for, uh, the day he was training in the gym, which.  But, uh, yeah, it was, it was an awesome experience.  Oh, my God, this guy put me to sleep like the last time they shot a tranquilizer dart at me.  And then I woke up, I had a radio collar and an ear peg.  But it's okay.  I rub against a tree and fall off.  They can't outsmart Tyson. 
[01:31:00]  Uh, all right.  Well, thank you, Sam.  No problem.  I had such a good holiday.  How was your holidays, Opie?  Uh, my holiday was great, Mike.  I had a good one.  I was having a great day.  Notice everyone, Mike Tyson talking to Opie.  Oh, damn it.  And how was yours, Anthony?  Real good, Mike.  Thanks, man.  You bet.  Yeah.  Happy holidays.  Happy holidays.  I had a great, uh, Christmas. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  But then it ended with a little bit of tragedy.  What happened?  Well, I was having fun.  And then, uh, Jaime pulled out my teeth.  And Yukon Cornelius pushed me off a cliff.  Bumbles, bounce.  Right, Anthony?  Right, Mike.  Yeah.  Opie, why are you talking into this bullhorn?  I'm not talking into that bullhorn. 
[01:32:00]  All right.  Very nice.  I had to throw Christmas ornaments because they was out of Samsonite luggage.  That could take a beating.  I could smash it against, I don't know, hotel room walls.  I don't know, airport at the carousel.  Or maybe metal bars.  And the luggage held up.  She didn't. 
[01:32:30]  Here's my love tap to her.  Hi, baby.  How you, Bobby?  It's been such a long time.  I love you.  Love.  T-R-L-C.  Oh, it's...  Oh, forget it.  It's the best effing punch I ever threw in my life.  That's what you said.  All right.  We've got to talk about Muhammad Ali next.  Oh, God damn. 
[01:33:00]  Ali's out of control.  You know, here's a guy who can do anything he wants.  The story about two weeks old.  Yeah.  We went on vacation like a day early.  Yeah.  And we should have.  But we'll talk about the Muhammad Ali thing next.  All right?  Also, is it true Britney Spears is no longer a virgin?  We've got a news clip and stuff?  That makes the news.  Yeah, right?  Really?  You could stick into my idea.  I was telling you about it in the back of the office, Anthony.  Ah.  What do you think?  Beautiful.  Opie and Anthony.  And on the eighth day, God said, let there be brass. 
[01:33:30]  Boom.  Wow.  Andy W.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Disturb the game.  Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock.  Listen to this boy.  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, man, where are you calling from?  I'm calling from Glen Burnie, Maryland.  Maryland, okay.  All right.  Yeah, I listened to your show in D.C.  I mean, you guys just don't have any format. 
[01:34:00]  It's boring.  Um, no, no format.  What do you mean by a format?  I don't know.  You guys are the professionals.  You should just come up with something.  So you want us to, wait, you want us to have a format?  What do you mean by format?  Just some type of, I don't know, man.  It's just like listening to two guys talk.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You just described our show.  Thank you, sir.  It's boring.  What are you normally doing?  Ah, see, there you go. 
[01:34:30]  What were, like, little cute trivia games that we were playing?  Would you like that?  Something.  Maybe, um...  You know, you got, like...  How about we'll get a little man on the street?  Oh, some of that.  Don and Mike, they do a good job.  Uh-huh.  That's Don and Mike.  We're doing our thing, man.  Yeah, but, you know, you guys wonder why you don't have any listeners in D.C.  We don't want a format.  This is what we want to do.  This is it.  It's a hang.  It's the Opie and Anthony hang.  Never know what you're going to hear.  People are coming and going. 
[01:35:00]  Sir, listen to what a dull human you are on the phone.  How could you possibly enjoy this radio program?  Yeah.  How am I a dull human?  Listen to you.  You have the charisma of testicular cancer.  Stink.  Just sitting there with that monotone.  I'm from Glen Burnie.  Are you really stupid?  David, nobody cares or likes it there.  You should have said kneecap cancer.  Yeah, I know.  Kneecap cancer is probably funnier, but testicular more sums up this video than vibe. 
[01:35:30]  All right, we'll work on a format.  Yeah, we'll work on a format just for you.  Put on a funny shirt, too, man.  All right, I appreciate it.  No, put on a funny shirt, too, man.  I like it already.  Yeah, I like that.  Hey, we're on to something.  Thanks, Tom.  We're going to change our whole show because of you.  All right.  You're welcome.  You're welcome.  We're going to take a look at who's in the entertainment news.  Hey, that's right.  5.06 in 22 seconds means it's time for entertainment news.  This just in, Britney Spears lost her virginity? 
[01:36:00]  Yes.  The rumor most circulating with this story that she's been plowed by her guy pal from NSYNC.  Who, Justin?  Yeah.  Timberlake?  Justin.  Yeah.  That's right.  Supposedly, he threw her the big hot beef injection over the weekend, over the holiday weekend.  And now she's walking like she's just ridden a horse cross country.  And I do mean country. 
[01:36:30]  Any old withering corpses in the news we can talk about and make it seem like we care they're dead?  And catch NSYNC in the new Star Wars movie.  The only thing that can make that NSYNC story better is if he's raped her.  Oh, God.  How would they report that?  Britney Spears raped her NSYNC boyfriend, Justin Timberlake.  All right.  We're done with entertainment news. 
[01:37:00]  There's history in the news.  We're done with entertainment news.  Oh, okay.  We've got to go on to our next format feature.  Would this be the hard-hitting news?  Hard-hitting news time, Anthony.  New York City has a new mayor.  New mayor?  His name's Bloomberg.  Mike Bloomberg taking over for the very popular former mayor, Giuliani.  Who, of course, brought us through the tragedy of 9-11.  7-59, 8 a cronk now. 
[01:37:30]  I don't know.  It's 5-08.  Well, that wasted two minutes.  Lieutenant Boogaloo from Jersey writes, the Opie and Anthony hang.  Don't tell Earl.  Don't tell Earl.  All right.  Well, we'll work in a format, I guess.  Right.  We'll just need a format.  Want to do some kind of trivia thing?  I like...  A role for some trivia?  I like the, what's the battle of the sexes?  Let's bring in our trivial pursuit and ask each other questions.  How about this?  You have a guy call in and a gal call in and ask them both questions. 
[01:38:00]  I like, though, the battle of the sexes where you actually, you have a gal call in and you  ask her the questions that only the guys have known.  Easy questions, but guy questions about things like motor parts and sports.  And then the guy calls in and you ask him the questions about things like cooking and getting  a big C up your C.  You know, huddle, huddle.  Just a friendly little radio game.  You know.  That's the way we like it down here in Maryland, along with our crab cakes. 
[01:38:30]  That's a hot steak, boy.  We could waste time by doing the 5 o'clock traffic chair.  Or how are we going to do that when it's played at the same time as the 5 o'clock funnies?  There's just not enough 5 o'clock.  Well, it's time for a Lily Tomlin record.  Oh, 5 o'clock funnies.  5 o'clock funnies.  And Mark Perrano wonders why he's not on radio.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Ah, yes. 
[01:39:00]  We could play a little game now.  I see it's 5.09 and 37 seconds, which means it's time for the dating game.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dating game.  We got some twat on the phone with the hymns.  And we're going to try to hook her up with someone who might just kill her.  Is this the kind of formatics you like?  You told. 
[01:39:30]  Anthony, what's up?  Guys, it's my birthday.  I want to know what celebrities share the same birthday as me.  Oh, that's celebrity music.  Oh, wait, wait.  God damn.  Hold on a second.  And you've got to read the horoscope or the horrible scope.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Wait, I want to know whose birthday it is today.  Now.  Get the paper.  This kills 30 seconds on a morning show.  Oh, we're not prepared to tell the people whose birthday it is today.  Damn it. 
[01:40:00]  Damn it.  Holy ass.  Hold on, Anthony.  We'll tell you.  La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  All right.  I'm getting there.  Hold on, Anthony.  We're not prepared for this.  Tomorrow we'll be prepared because we just came up with this brilliant...  This is a brand new format.  When DC won a format, darn it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:40:30]  Damn, I can't find, um...  You can't find the celebrity birthday?  Oh, oh.  Maybe here.  Celebrity.  I'll kill time while we find the paper.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Happy birthday going out to a bunch of our listeners today.  Joe's 35 and Stiefer.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Very celebrating the big 3-0 in New York City. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  And little Jimmy's 12 today.  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday to the big 3-0 in New York City.  I don't have any celebrity birthday sites.  We don't have the celebrity birthdays?  I'm looking all over the web.  Someone's got to tell us, you know, what celebrities are having a birthday today.  I got to hang up on Anthony because he's listening to him and himself as we try to do this wacky bit here, Anthony. 
[01:41:30]  There's an idea.  The bullshit.  It's a radio prep site.  Go to Prep Burger, Anthony.  Where's Prep Burger?  Where's Prep Burger when you need it?  This is how pathetic.  We don't even know who his birthday is.  This is like the easiest bit to do in radio.  I got it.  In radio, that should be in front of you.  Right.  At all times.  Right after what day it is.  Yeah.  Today's birthday.  Today's birthdays. 
[01:42:00]  God damn it.  Know what else we need for today?  We need the celebrity birthdays and we need what happened on this date in history.  Somebody help us.  What happened in this day in history?  Hold on.  Hold on.  It's January.  What's today's date?  January 2nd?  Oh.  Match me.  Here we go.  All right.  Celebrity birthdays?  Wait.  Give me it.  Wait.  Give me some.  Oh, all right.  We'll do this.  Ah.  It's not queued up.  You need the birthday music. 
[01:42:30]  Damn it.  All right.  Go ahead.  Just do it, I guess.  If you were born on the 2nd of January, you would share a birthday with Jim Baker.  Remember him?  Jim Baker.  Jim Baker.  Oh, yeah.  That religious guy.  Right.  Tia Carrera.  The hot Tia Carrera.  Ho, ho.  From Wayne's World, right?  Yes.  Sure.  Gabrielle Carteris.  And, of course, that talented Negro, Cuba Gooding Jr.  Ooh.  Ooh, did I say Waddle Doodle? 
[01:43:00]  Damn, maybe I should have gone to tomorrow.  Mel Gibson in Victoria Principal.  And Dabney Coleman tomorrow.  Tomorrow?  Oh, I wish it was tomorrow.  Don't blow it.  You just wrecked the bit for tomorrow.  I know.  Maybe they're not going to tune in for the celebrity birthdays,  because they already know who's born tomorrow, Anthony.  If Tom wants structure, maybe every day at 5 o'clock he could bring his wife into the studio  and we could milk her into a bucket and then bash her brains in with a rock. 
[01:43:30]  Jesus.  What else in imagination, my friend?  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I'm stuck on the Jersey Turnpike and I'm waiting for the traffic report.  Uh-oh.  And some 5 o'clock bunnies.  All right, hold on, hold on.  Hi, it's O&A traffic here high above Manhattan looking down.  Wow.  Seems to be a lot of traffic in the same spots that they were yesterday.  And I'm assuming it's going to clear up around the same time it does every day. 
[01:44:00]  Back to you in the studio.  Thank you for that, Anthony.  Well, the guy wanted his traffic.  All right, let me go to Doug from Springfield.  Doug, what's going on?  I want to hear Office of the Day.  How about...  Holy ass.  There's a lot of great radio ideas that went on.  Office of the Day.  So what did this entail?  And the winner of it is Office Full of Dirty, Stinking Sluts. 
[01:44:30]  Take it easy, guys.  No, it's pathetic.  I did all these little cute little bits.  So Office of the Day?  Office of the Day, you fax in where you're working, and they pick a random fax, and they're  the Office of the Day.  They're the Office of the Day, and then you give them, like, gift certificates to, like,  Fridays and stuff.  Oh, God, that's great.  Right, and maybe Blockbuster certificates and...  And what?  Didn't you deliver some of that stuff?  Shut up.  I used to have to deliver pizza in Rochester for Kano.  This day in history opening 1960s, Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts announced 
[01:45:00]  his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination.  And in 1965, the New York just signed University Alabama quarterback, Joe Namath, for a reported  $400,000.  Today in news.  We need, like, music bands to, like, jazz it up a little bit.  I hope this is working in Maryland.  Don't you guys have a new employee starting today making $102.70 now?  Congrats, huh? 
[01:45:30]  But before they become the new employee, they've got to fire the other one.  Oh, yeah.  Jay Smith from Hicksville, you're fired.  That's right.  That's right.  God damn.  This is awful.  I've never heard of this one.  I've been around a long time, man.  Chris, what's up?  Nothing, guys.  I'd like to request Start Me Up. 
[01:46:00]  All right.  For the Rolling Home with the Stones block you're going to be playing soon?  Rolling Home with the Stones block.  You never heard that on the radio, did you?  Tell me if someone does that.  Man, Key 104 here in New York is going to steal that one.  Rolling Home with the Stones.  That is quite an idea.  Yeah, it's awful.  They do on a station up here.  Too bad it wasn't Tuesday.  Two for Tuesday.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  All right.  Let it do.  All right.  All right. 
[01:46:30]  We're starting you up for your ride home.  Rolling Home with the Rolling Stones.  Here on the ONA Show.  You hit the post.  It's all about the music.  Let me go to Ron.  Ron, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Hey, I'm waiting for weather on the 8s. 
[01:47:00]  I mean, you're past 518.  Come on, guys.  That's not 518 in, like, 20 seconds here.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Which means we're going to have to do the Q or the D after weather with the 8s.  Or 8s with the weather or whatever.  All right.  I didn't want to miss it.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  You know, it all happens.  Who's this?  Yo, who's this?  Hello?  Yeah, you're on the radio.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  I wanted to call in my Old, New, Borrowed, and Blue set. 
[01:47:30]  Old, New, Borrowed, and Blue.  So you play an old song, a new song, a remake, and then a little blues.  That's the best.  That's great radio, guys.  Oh.  Old, New, Borrowed, and Blue?  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  Can I get that?  That was famous on the Dave Herman Rock and Roll Morning Show.  I've got to cut you off.  It's time for weather on the 8s.  Yes, sir?  Uh, Opie, uh, tomorrow, we're going to look at, uh, temperatures in the 40s.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:48:00]  Uh, and then Friday, uh, sunny, high at 29 degrees.  That's for New York, though.  Uh, yeah.  Well, you know.  What about, like, um, Buffalo?  Oh, you want, like, a national weather?  Yeah, maybe a national weather.  All right.  Let me look at the map.  Uh-uh.  Ah, look.  Two, two, two for Tuesday.  Two for Tuesday on W...  What?  Tuesday?  I used to do that.  Uh, right around your area, we're looking at, uh, ooh, 27 degrees in Chicago.  Uh, Atlanta, Georgia, with 32 degrees in, uh, New York, 40. 
[01:48:30]  Miami, 72 degrees.  Quite palmy there, and we don't broadcast there, so it doesn't matter.  Is this the format he was looking for?  Uh, Greg, what's up?  Yo.  How you doing?  All right, Greg.  Don't forget to do the shout-outs.  I'd like to shout-out to all my friends.  Oh, if you do shout-outs.  I'm going to give Vic a gun off the cliff.  If you're...  What's up?  What's up?  If you're a radio guy and you do shout-outs, shout-outs, put the barrel of the gun in your 
[01:49:00]  mouth and pull the trigger.  Thank you.  How do you guys talk next?  Hey, for the weather, could you do something like...  It would be like a routine thing, but a little different.  Like, depending on the...  Like, what you do is you...  Like, to determine the temperature.  Yeah.  You say, how long would it take if you left your baby outside for it to die?  Is that the type of format they're looking for in Maryland, though?  If today's an eight-minute day, people are going to know, wow, it's in the 20s.  It's got to be cold.  Are we going to be getting the let out? 
[01:49:30]  We can get the let out, sure.  Why not?  Yeah.  Dying for a little stairway here.  Right after Mandatory Metallica.  Hey, I'd be pinching to it, Scott, from D.C.  All right.  Well, there, maybe that's what they were looking for.  Julio, what's up?  Hey, I want to play the elevator from hell.  Ah.  When are you guys going to drop the pumpkin?  Wow.  Elevator from hell.  We've got to explain that one.  We try to buy the elevator from hell bit. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  From Mark Rarento?  Yes.  We went and sell it.  Yeah, that's a true story.  Mark Rarento, we were up against him in Boston.  He had two bits.  He did the 5 o'clock funnies, where he'd play like a scratchy Lily Tomlin record for about five minutes.  Yeah.  Right at 5 o'clock.  But every day it would be a different comedian.  Of course.  But equally as funny, because you didn't know which comedian he was going to play every day. 
[01:50:30]  It was always a surprise.  What is this?  And then he did Elevator from Hell, and we called up the company that sold him the Elevator from Hell bit, and we tried to buy it so he would have only one bit to do every day.  Look at this radio bit called Oodles.  Oodles.  Each answer begins with a given letter.  You get four out of five, and you win.  Today's letter, the letter P.  Letter P.  You've got to guess what word this is, or what I'm trying to say.  Midday meal at the electric utility. 
[01:51:00]  Midday meal at the electric utility.  Powder puff?  Oh, I'm so close.  P.  Polyps?  No.  Where's my sound effect?  Find my buzzer, Rick.  There it is.  Find my buzzer.  There it is.  No, I'm sorry.  No.  P.  Polyps.  That's power lunch.  Get it?  Oh, power lunch.  Okay, let me try another one.  Oodles.  Oodles.  Working with the letter P. 
[01:51:30]  Where a Joey rides.  A Joey.  Which, of course, is a baby kangaroo.  Oh, pouch.  Very good.  There's one.  Sorry, if I get the other two, I get a prize?  You need three.  Three?  No.  Soft drink music.  Soft drink music.  Soft drink music?  Soft drink music.  Music, soft drink.  I'm a pepper, you're a pepper.  No, commonly.  This is a name for a soft drink that they use at Western Down South.  They call it something else. 
[01:52:00]  Pop.  Pop.  Pop music.  Yes.  Oh, okay.  Pirate diving board.  A pirate.  Plank.  Plank.  Yes.  One more.  One more.  What do I win?  Like, some good skips?  You win my flag-waving missile.  Flag-waving missile.  Patriots?  Yes!  Yes!  Wow, there it is.  It's our oodles for the day.  Letter P.  And between Opie and Norton, you've gotten four out of five right, so you win. 
[01:52:30]  How about with a C?  Hey, everybody!  Come on, everyone.  Go crazy!  There's a five o'clock whistle.  Where are you going before today?  God damn, there'd be a gun.  Ah-ooh!  Ah-ooh!  Go!  Ah-ooh! 
[01:53:00]  Ah!  Ah!  Yeah!  That's wonderful.  That's wonderful.  Jamaica.  Woo-hoo!  Hey, we're all working for the weekend!  Ah-ooh!  Ah-ooh!  Ah-ooh!  It's hump day, but we're getting there.  We're getting to the weekend!  Hump day.  This is supposed to be played on Friday. 
[01:53:30]  Ah-ooh!  Ah-ooh!  Ah-ooh!  Ah-ooh!  Ah-ooh!  Ah-ooh!  Ah-ooh!  Ah-ooh!  Ah-ooh!  Ah-ooh!  Ah-ooh!  Ah-ooh!  Ah-ooh!  Ah-ooh!  Hey, she come now, stay at home.  Everyone, stick me on the board.  Hey!  Hey!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  What?  I...  What?  I was just singing like the dude with the college mixers.  You're kidding.  Get laid.  Get F?  Yeah, well, yeah.  That would work a little better there.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:54:00]  Well, let's go to John.  John, what's going on?  Hello, love!  How's it going, guys?  All right, John, what do you have?  Hey, they got one radio station out here near Allentown.  They do Oh, Wow Wednesdays.  There's a station in Connecticut that does that, too.  Yeah, it's supposed to be songs you haven't heard in a while.  It's supposed to make you go, oh, wow.  Well, do you have one?  Let's give it a little try.  All right.  Let's see.  How about Twisted Sister? 
[01:54:30]  We're not going to take it.  How about that one?  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  Hold on, I've got to step in.  That's not an old wow song.  We can't play that because that's one of our Friday songs.  That's right.  Oh, shoot.  You can't mix those up.  And according to Selector, we played that recently.  We can't play it again.  Hey, guys, one more for you.  One more for you.  Same radio station.  Every morning at 8 o'clock, they do like two or three Led Zeppelin songs,  and they call it Getting the Lead Out. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, Getting the Lead Out, of course.  That's an AOR staple.  Ah, I see.  All right, guys, you suck.  All right, bye.  Someone's saying we should pick a new partner by seat number at Fenway Park.  That would be a good one.  I want to do All Wow Wednesday.  Oh, wow.  Hey, maybe you could get everybody to turn their radios at work up real loud  and play Take This Job and Shove It.  Ah, yeah.  Let the bosses hear it.  The high five at five?  I haven't heard of that one. 
[01:55:30]  I haven't heard of that one, but I'm sure it's five songs at five o'clock.  Fury is five at nine.  And then there's the top nine at nine.  Yeah.  Rob, and then you do it at ten to be really crazy.  Yeah.  Well, they're already crazy because it's nine instead of ten.  Right.  All countdowns are ten.  Rob, what's up?  Rob?  No, it's Rob.  Oh, what's up?  Hey, I'm from Cleveland.  Yeah.  I'm a first-time listener, but I love your format, guys. 
[01:56:00]  Thank you.  Keep up the good work.  Love the format.  Hey, thank you, Brett.  We got to interrupt you because, you know, Buffalo had seven feet of snow,  and we got to do the school closings for today.  Oh, that's right.  We need beds for this, though.  You can't just have the school closings.  School closings, waste of time.  Yeah, it's very important to school closings. 
[01:56:30]  Every school that's covered in snow is closed.  Thank you.  I want to do All While Wednesday.  Yeah.  Can we call ourselves a zoo?  And I want to see if someone could stump us with a joke.  Ah.  The first person that stumps us with a joke wins something.  Uh, something.  Ten songs are ten grand?  That is ten in a row?  Oh, yeah.  Like he's going to just mess up.  Right.  I used to love listening to those, and they'd be like, 
[01:57:00]  and I think I'm going to miss a song coming up in the six o'clock hour.  Well, how do you know?  Oh, well.  I thought it was supposed to be just a music montage.  Random thing that happened.  Real quick clips of the songs?  Come on.  Where's our music montage?  If you guess all 27 songs included in the montage.  We can't do the all-request lunch hour, because we're not on during lunch hour.  That's great. 
[01:57:30]  Well, there you go.  Oh, Earl has picked out an Oh Wow Wednesday song.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Earl.  Are you going to let us know what it is, or should we just play it?  All right, here's today's Oh Wow Wednesday song.  Let's hear it.  I do that, Ron.  Oh, wow.  This is Ian Dury, right?  Oh, no.  Tim Curry, right?  Ian Dury and the blockheads. 
[01:58:00]  No, this is Tim Curry.  Is it?  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Who gives a hell?  Let's go to Philly.  Jim, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  You want to play psychic trivia?  What is that?  What's psychic trivia?  Where have we been?  The station in Philly.  The station that wanted to hire you guys. 
[01:58:30]  Their morning show plays psychic trivia, and the idea is that if you listen to the show  all morning, something goofy happened during the day, and they're going to say, okay,  here's the question.  Okay, you got it?  Now, go up and give us the answer.  You guys are...  And you have to guess what they're thinking about.  Ho, ho!  Guys, how about the phrase that pays?  Yeah.  What's the phrase that pays?  I guess you're freaking out of a mule.  Oh, that's correct.  You win! 
[01:59:00]  We're going to call up random houses during the day, and you have to answer the phone  with the phrase that pays.  So all your friends think you're...  What is today's...  Oh, wait, we got someone that wants to stump us with a joke, you guys.  All right!  Hey, what's up, guys?  Oh, we should have wacky music, man.  All right, hold on.  We got to get some music for a bit.  We got to...  You know, something wacky.  No wacky? 
[01:59:30]  No.  All right, hold on.  Rick's getting us some wacky music.  You got us another Oh, Wow Wednesday song?  I am digging the new format.  That's great.  I'm liking it.  And it's much better than anyone else's, because we're incorporating every single one  of these things into one show.  All right, Anthony, we got a new...  People just take one or two of these genius things and do it during their program.  People in D.C. like their schedule. 
[02:00:00]  We want to be on schedule.  There it is.  Rick's got something for our...  All right.  Our little joke-off.  Joke-off.  First person...  It's a joke-off.  That stumps us with...  All right, here we go.  What the hell is that, Rick?  It stinks.  Kid-toucher music.  Sorry, wrong game.  This is like the music we used to play for our Evil Barney.  I'll give you a quarter if I can get it, a quarter of the way in, 50 cents if it goes  halfway in, a dollar if it goes in all the way in. 
[02:00:30]  All right, listen.  That's the music you hear when you start feeling guilty about what you've just done.  Andrew.  What's up, O&A?  What's up?  You got a joke for us today?  Yeah, long-time listener.  Love your show.  Is it a joke you can find in a typical joke book?  I don't believe so.  Uh-oh.  All right, check it out.  There's three ebony women in the ghetto on the street corner.  Uh-huh.  They're all wearing non-book potato stacks.  How do you know which one's the prostitute? 
[02:01:00]  Ah.  Oh.  Oh.  Well, now, give us time.  Give us time.  That's the game.  See, we have to...  Give us time to flip through all our joke books we got in the studio.  Let me see.  I got it.  You guys got it?  Oh, oh, oh.  Norton's got it.  I got it in the background.  She's the one with the whole...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  That's not how you play.  Listen to that language.  Oh, no.  Dive, dive.  Can I give it to you?  Wait, hold on.  All right.  If we're going to do this bit, we've got to get at least five or six people that give us 
[02:01:30]  jokes that we know, and then, you know, the seventh one will stump us, and then we  can move on to something else.  You're crazy, Norton.  He's crazy.  Guys, this is my first time calling.  You can't let me...  Ah, that's it.  All right, hold on.  So, what's the joke again, Andrew?  All right.  There's three black women standing on a street corner wearing nothing but potato sacks.  How do you know which one's the prostitute?  How do you know which one is the prostitute? 
[02:02:00]  They're wearing gunny sacks or potato sacks?  Potato sacks.  Huh?  Hmm.  This is very difficult.  I...  Uh...  Sounds like my mother-in-law.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  That's a stick.  Hold on.  I'm going to have a beer.  Ah.  There we are.  Oh, nothing better than a good beer.  Uh, what's the... 
[02:02:30]  Hold on.  I'm going to...  Okay.  Crank one out.  Oh, that's all right.  All right.  I just thought I'd crank one out.  Oh, that's all right.  You guys rock.  What's the...  What's the answer to the joke?  All right.  She's the one that...  The potato sack says Idaho.  Idaho.  I got it.  I got it.  Ho, ho, ho.  Well, we're not adding that bit to our format because we stink at it.  Hey, guys, I want to...  The first caller's not supposed to get it.  I know.  Nah, but it's fine for people in the cars to guess and shout at the radio.  Play along at home.  Hey, guys, I stumped you. 
[02:03:00]  I want to win a prize.  You get nothing.  Thank you.  Wait, Ernie's got something.  Ernie, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  How about flush the format?  That's when you get rid of the format and you just do what you would want to do.  Come whatever off the top of your head.  Is that what we were supposed to do?  Before we got our new format, thanks to the guy in Maryland?  Some stations do flush the format.  If they play, like, rock music or something, they're like, well, we're going to flush the format.  And next thing you know, they do 20 minutes of, like, reggae music. 
[02:03:30]  There you go.  Can you help me with my daughter's homework?  I don't know if I could ask you.  There you go.  That's a good format.  Trying to get that one through.  Thank you.  O.P., I'd just like to read off the school lunch menu for the local school.  Chicken nuggets.  You're going to have a choice of a pork egg roll, steamed rice, corn on the cob, some cherry applesauce, chilled peaches with plum-dried cranberries, no salad, sorry.  And, of course, your choice of milk.  There it is, the school lunch menu. 
[02:04:00]  Stosh, what's up?  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  You have the Menage à Trois Tuesday?  What's that?  They play three songs by the same band.  If they play a fourth song, it's called a four-play, you call in and win.  And I think with the Menage à Trois Tuesday, because I think I did that one at a station, you play, like, snippets of three songs all at the same time, because they're all going at it at the same time.  And then you have to decipher what three songs were just played. 
[02:04:30]  And if you get all three songs from the same artist, usually, you win the prize.  But if there's a fourth song, Spuds, does it change?  Well, then it would be the four-play weekend.  But the four-play weekend, you see there's four songs from the same artist.  Oh, God.  And the fourth track is always live on a four-play weekend.  We need a character, though, like a wacky call-in character.  Professor Joke Guy.  Hello?  Hello, it's Professor Joke Guy. 
[02:05:00]  Hi, Professor Joke Guy.  How are you today?  Very good.  I have a joke for you.  Oh, great, Professor Joke Guy.  What happens when local medicine factory has a quiet day?  What happens?  I don't know.  Now, you've got to repeat it.  I don't know.  Professor Joke Guy.  What happens when the local medicine factory has a quiet day?  You can hear a cough drop.  Oh, he's incorrigible. 
[02:05:30]  Looking forward to hearing him the same exact time tomorrow.  Rich, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, man?  Hey.  I want to do the car phone check-in.  The what?  The car phone check-in.  What the hell is the car phone check-in?  You call in and you say what road you're on.  Like, you're like, hey, I'm on Route 50.  I've got a dead hooker in the trunk.  And a rigor mortis is about to set in.  So I've got to go.  Yeah, the car phone check-in, man.  All right.  Very good.  Big in D.C.  All right.  All right.  Maybe we'll do something when my wife calls in and talks for four hours. 
[02:06:00]  Ah, that'd be great.  I've got a wacky phone scam.  I've got to turn my mic off for that one.  Stop tempting.  Mark, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Got a joke for you guys.  Oh, are you going to try to stump us?  Yep, I'm going to stump you.  All right.  What does a gay horse eat? 
[02:06:30]  What does a gay horse eat?  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Um.  People are probably screaming at their radio.  What does a gay horse eat?  Let's see.  Close.  Wait a minute.  You can't say.  How come this new format, we've had to dump ourselves so many times.  Hall and Oats?  Nope. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, that was a good try, though.  What's the answer, Mark?  Hey.  Oh, we stink.  We're 0 for 2.  That's kind of funny.  That's a good joke.  Hey, you've got to give it to the guys.  We're 0 for 2, and at this rate, we're going to run out of prizes.  We stink.  All right.  Thank you.  Yep.  What a great new format, though.  I like it.  Joe, you're next to the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:07:30]  Hey, I just heard the song of the day, Start Me Up by the Stones.  I want to guess the high-low jackpot.  High-low jackpot.  How confusing.  What is that?  The hell is the high-low jackpot?  You hear the song of the day, you've got to call in and guess the high-low jackpot?  Yes.  All right.  Take a guess.  $17,224.02.  Oh, I'm sorry.  But you know something.  Work off of what he said, and maybe that'll help the next person that guesses. 
[02:08:00]  Was it too high or too low?  That was too high.  Oh, man.  I tell you guys, fuck, when I'm calling from D.C., you might believe me.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Let's go to Evan.  Evan, what's up?  Hey, could you guys pass the bong?  Oh, we were so busy earlier, we forgot to do the 420 bong hit.  420 bong hit.  There we go.  Hey, we're really smoking pot in here.  Party hard. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, thanks, man.  Yeah.  How's that?  Take that with you.  Georgia.  Later.  Georgia.  All right.  Well, Kyla, what's up?  Hey, can I be today's dashboard DJ?  What the hell is that?  You want to be today's dashboard DJ for the day?  Well, I pull over to the side of the road and I'm out for the next song on my cell phone.  Dashboard DJ.  All right, Kyla.  You're today's dashboard DJ.  Oh, please, let me just scream through tires and a wall.  Boy, I hope it's a song we play. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, gosh.  Here at WAW 1027, we're going to play Leonard Skinner.  Dashboard DJs.  Thank you so much, guys, and have a great day.  Thank you.  Every day is your chance to be a dashboard DJ.  All you need is a phone in your car and you can be a dashboard DJ.  Leonard Skinner, Sweet Home Alabama.  You heard our dashboard DJ just call this one in.  You can, too. 
[02:09:30]  Every day, our dashboard DJs are announcing the songs we play here for you.  Leonard Skinner, Sweet Home Alabama.  Oh, my name's y'all.  Ah, you're a little rusty.  I was a little short.  You didn't hit the post there.  I was enjoying that.  I got it on a beat.  Dashboard DJ.  Close, but you know what?  If we were really good at this, we'd have the song playing as she was requesting it.  I know.  Like, how do they do that?  How do they know that she was going to request a song that's playing in the background? 
[02:10:00]  Now we need somebody to do that.  Oh, it's terrible.  Hey, how about the bit where you drive a bit into the ground?  I love that bit.  This is fun, though.  It is fun.  Another caller wants to try to stump us with a joke.  All right.  Don, what's up?  Hey, guys, how you doing?  Hey.  What did the dog say when he sat on sandpaper?  What did the dog say when he sat on sandpaper? 
[02:10:30]  Rough.  Oh, my God.  You're not stopping us.  You're not stopping us tonight.  Sorry, sir.  You lose.  Goodbye, guys.  Bye.  Doug, what's going on?  Hey, can we play secret sound?  Guess the sound effect.  Do we have a secret sound? 
[02:11:00]  Do we have a sound effect?  I'd like to.  I am the 100th caller.  All right.  Let's see.  Norton, do you have a secret sound sound effect for us?  I certainly do.  Let me hear.  Oh, no.  No, not that one.  That can't be the secret sound.  Oh, you're giving too many hints out.  Here's the secret sound.  What is that, Doug? 
[02:11:30]  Monica Lewinsky?  Yeah.  It's a BJ joke.  Always funny.  Anthony, what's up?  That's right.  Here's the rest of that sound.  Go ahead, Anthony.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I'm on 495 sitting in traffic.  I'm in a 2002 Mitsubishi Lancer with my friends just checking in.  I want to let you know what kind of car I'm driving.  What is that?  Hot 97 does that. 
[02:12:00]  You call in, and you see what kind of car you're driving.  Why?  Hot 97, why do they want you to call in with what kind of car you stole?  So they get a jacket from you.  I don't know, man.  They just call up and say what kind of car they're driving.  Well, that sounds like a good little bit there.  I got a joke to stump you guys with.  Oh, wow.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Set up for this.  Boy.  Hold on.  Hold on.  That was unexpected.  Hold on.  We're not prepared.  I got to get the joke music back.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Go ahead, stop us with the joke, sir. 
[02:12:30]  All right.  Why do blacks have flat noses?  Why do blacks have flat noses?  This sounds a little risque for our show.  I might want to call the grease man with this type of racial humor.  Or Muhammad Ali.  Or Muhammad Ali.  Yeah, he seems to like the racy jokes himself.  We'll get into that story next.  I, I, I, I, um, I can't, um, I don't want to go near this one. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You know something, sir?  We are going to opt to stay safe here.  This is a little too hot to handle.  Let's not, uh, continue with, uh, this, this joke, sir.  A little risque.  Where about unity?  Family programming, I understand.  Where about unity in the community?  I understand.  Okay.  Well, what is the answer if, um, um, that would be, uh, that's where God put his foot and  he ripped their tails off.  Oh, my.  Good night, guys.  No.  You know, that type of, uh, thing is not going to be tolerated on our radio show. 
[02:13:30]  Um, that is awful.  This is, you know, I'd like to take a look.  I'd like to take this opportunity to, to tell people we all have to get together in  this time after we've all seen such tragedy together.  I feel, I feel a fake suspension coming on.  We're going to be checking in with Spuds Buckley in a little bit, so stick around.  I know he gives me the finger.  Hey, there you go. 
[02:14:00]  Chris, what's up?  Chris, what's up?  What's up?  Hey.  What's going on?  What up?  How are y'all doing today?  Very well.  What do you got?  What do you got?  So, you guys want to hear another joke or what?  Uh-oh.  All right, this will be the last joke because I think we're pounding the, uh, the, uh,  stump the joke thing into the ground here.  Go ahead.  Ready?  Yeah.  All right.  Why is it that there is no Walmart in Afghanistan?  Why is it that there is no Walmart in Afghanistan?  Hmm.  Let's think this out. 
[02:14:30]  Norton, do you have an idea?  Okay.  Rick, maybe Ben, are you thinking?  They don't build Walmarts where...  No idea?  Anybody?  What's that, uh...  Because they don't build Walmarts where monkeys are being killed.  Close, close, close, close.  No, no, that's not it.  I'm sorry.  No, no, no.  Uh, what's the answer, sir?  No, no one knows?  No.  You stumped us.  Well, because there's a target on every corner.  A target is a store target. 
[02:15:00]  All right.  There you go.  Like that one, huh?  I'm digging this format.  No.  It's so easy.  Thank you, Chris.  I think we got some, uh, uh, some new ideas for, uh, for our format, Anthony.  Uh, yes, uh, Mark the Gay Chef.  What's up?  Yeah, yeah, sure.  Yeah.  Happy, uh, I mean, Happy New Year.  Hey, it's Frenchy!  Yeah, how you doing?  It's our character, Frenchy!  Yes, that's right.  What's up?  How's it going?  All right, what do you got?  I got a little joke, actually.  All right. 
[02:15:30]  So, why does black people come, uh, to work on Monday with a bunch of scratch on their faces?  Uh-huh.  And, uh, scratches.  Um, I don't...  I don't even know, Frenchy.  I didn't even understand the joke.  Why do they come to work, uh...  With their faces scratched up.  Scratched up.  I've never heard of this, uh, Frenchy.  Well, uh, they eat with a fork on Sunday.  I have a better idea, Frenchy. 
[02:16:00]  Yes?  Maybe every day at six you can call in and give an instance of where your country has exhibited  cowardice.  Well, there's some 5,000 troops there.  What are you talking about?  5,000 troops.  What, to cook?  Yes, exactly.  Please.  That country of yours, all over Europe, giving up their money.  You surrendered your money.  Yeah, sure.  We're backing up again, right?  Just like we did in World War II, as always.  We'll kill them with pastries.  Look at the only hero out of World War II was Le Bon from Logan's Heroes.  Part of the resistance.  All right. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, well.  Bye, Frenchy.  All right.  Take care.  Uh, Brian, what's going on?  Nothing much.  All right.  Go ahead, Brian.  Uh, I'd like to guess the number one song in the Firecracker 500.  Oh, the Firecracker 500, yes.  Is it going to be Stairway to Heaven?  Uh-huh.  Freebird?  Freebird?  Freebird, yeah.  I'll go with Freebird.  Freebird.  Well, actually, it's, uh, we'll get fooled again by the movie.  Oh, they pulled a fast one on me.  And also, isn't there also a bit where you play a song backwards, and I have to try and 
[02:17:00]  guess what it is?  Yeah, forward, yeah.  Backwards forward or something like that?  Yeah.  I believe Opie's old station may have played it.  Maybe.  Thank you, Brian.  You're welcome.  Well, yeah, I did some of these growing up in the business.  We'll be checking in with Mad Max a little later in the program.  Charlie, what's up?  Hey, guys, how you doing?  I was wondering if we could maybe call my girlfriend and pretend break up with her.  And then when she gets really mad, you guys can just say, hey, it's just Opie and Anthony, 
[02:17:30]  and we can all have a laugh together.  That's right.  And we all will laugh.  Oh, that'd be so great, guys.  Toy with each other.  Thank you, Charlie.  Okay.  All right.  Well, that wasted 40 minutes.  Thank you.  Yeah, that's nice.  Thanks for the idea there in Maryland.  Do you think Vos could come in every day at, like, 3 o'clock and do the Jews that should  have killed themselves 10 years ago segment?  All right. 
[02:18:00]  The Muhammad Ali story is next.  Yeah, I think that's fitting right about now.  Do we have time?  Oh, we have no time.  We went really late.  We'll be back.  There's a car that's around next to me.  Put out your cans.  Pull out your fun bags.  What are you waiting for?  Do it.  Do it now.  We're rolling.  It looks fabulous.  Opie and Anthony.  We love seeing boobs.  Well, duh.  Andy.  Come with me.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:18:30]  Come, come, come.  Hey.  How you doing?  Sam Adams.  It made your Christmas better, didn't it?  Didn't it?  Yes.  Yes, it did.  You come over your house.  You came over your family's house.  You had the ice cold Sam Adams.  Ah, look at that.  Brought the good beer.  We love it.  Make all your winter adventures and celebrations better with America's best tasting beer.  Sam Adams Winter Lager.  Sam Adams Winter Lager, the number one selling winter seasonal. 
[02:19:00]  That's right, it is.  Subtly spiced with fresh ginger, cinnamon, and orange.  Sam Adams Winter Lager is smooth, full body, and satisfying.  It is a true winter classic.  We love it.  We think the people at Boston Beer are great.  Jim Cook, what a guy.  What an innovator when it comes to beer.  You want great beer, straight up.  Sam Adams Winter Lager and all the great Sam Adams beer.  Check it out, Sam Adams. 
[02:19:30]  And E.W.  I hope you're enjoying the new format.  Lots of new games to play on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's a kill time.  Sure.  Less psychobabble and more games.  Well, that guy from Maryland wanted a format, he said.  He goes, you guys don't have a format.  So we were just having a little fun.  You know, cute little games to play.  So.  Gilby from Washington, D.C. writes on the Instant Feedback.  Guys, I picked up your bid in the middle of it.  But there is a station in Washington. 
[02:20:00]  They have a DJ named Roach, who plays two seconds of three songs, and you have to pick the songs.  They are called Roach Clips.  All right.  Oh, yes.  Wow.  Roach Clips.  Dan from Yonkers, he writes, guys, I want my laugh in the fast lane.  Laugh in the fast lane.  And Luciana from New Jersey writes, guys, don't forget the uh-um game where the station asks you a question, 
[02:20:30]  and you can't say the word um or uh, or you will not win.  Another Z100 loser game.  Ah.  Unless you're talking about an underage girl, then you can't say um.  Hmm.  Should we play the uh-um game with Norton real fast?  You want to try uh-um?  We give him a subject, and you've got 60 seconds to talk about with no spaces.  You've got to continually talk, and you can't use uh or um.  Hmm.  Well, you want to do it with Norton or Colin? 
[02:21:00]  Should we do it with a caller?  Let's do it with a caller.  Really?  Yeah.  Okay.  Hi, who's the...  Oh, figures.  Um, all right, let's try Mike.  Mike!  How are you doing my favorite disc jockeys?  Hey, Mike.  You want to play the um game?  Oh, I'm dying to.  All right, you've got 60 seconds to, um, talk about, talk about, um, oh, oh, I would have lost. 
[02:21:30]  You want it to be something in the news, maybe?  Something, uh...  Sure.  News-related?  How about, uh, uh, New Year's?  Ah.  Mike, you have 60 seconds to talk about New Year's without saying uh or um.  Okay, well, uh, this New Year's...  Gosh darn it, I stink.  I hope you did it on purpose.  Okay, well, uh...  You got a freeway's third word. 
[02:22:00]  All right, thank you.  You suck at that.  That game sucks.  A lot tougher than it seems, huh, guys?  It sure is, Jimmy.  I don't know if you guys have realized what time it is.  It's six o'clock.  It's six o'clock plugs.  The six o'clock plugs.  We're going to start that feature?  Well, I think it was just way to start off the six o'clock hour when most people are listening.  Billy, what's up?  Hey, hey. 
[02:22:30]  Hey, uh, on the station you guys are in, in Cleveland, uh, there's a guy in the morning.  He said, uh, twice.  Oh, we're still playing?  Oh, I thought we were playing the other game.  Oh, no.  Oh, sorry.  All right, go ahead, Billy.  Yeah, there's a guy in the...  In the morning in Cleveland is a guy who wraps the weather.  He wraps the weather?  Yeah, his name's M.C. Chetaflow.  M.C. Chetaflow.  And he wraps the weather.  He wraps the weather.  So there's cute little rhymes that go with the temperature and stuff? 
[02:23:00]  Yes, that's true.  I'm sure it's very old school.  I'm here to say...  It's cold today.  Yeah.  The producer of this show is rumored to be gay.  He couldn't get a job anywhere else.  All right.  Well, thank you, Billy.  No problem.  We've got to start our own new features, I think.  And I think Megan's going to help us.  It's the six o'clock queef.  Megan?  I'll hold on for just a second.  It's going to take me a second to get ready.  Well, hold on.  We want to talk to you all. 
[02:23:30]  All right, you can talk to me.  This is our new bit on the O.P. and Anthony show.  We goofed around.  The people in command.  Hold on.  We goofed around with all the bits everyone else is doing, and now we're going to start creating  new ones.  The six o'clock queef.  The six o'clock queef.  All right.  That's cool.  And Megan, where are you calling from?  Ohio.  Ohio.  We'll be doing the six o'clock queef today.  Queef for today.  Ohio representing.  Let's not...  Ohio representing, yeah.  Let's not explain what a queef is, and let's not explain what you're doing.  I think we all know what a queef is.  No, no, no.  Nobody...  All right, Megan. 
[02:24:00]  Are you ready to do the six o'clock queef?  Yeah, I'll try my best.  Sometimes it don't work.  Sometimes it does.  Well, I hope it works.  I hope it does, too, because I wanted to be on this radio show.  It's cool as hell.  Everyone be quiet.  Let's listen.  Can we get a fun little sweeper that intros the six o'clock queef feature?  Maybe a little jingle?  Yeah, a little jingle.  A little song, maybe?  It sounds like a burp, but it smells like catfish, Bob.  That's what I can do.  All right.  No, you said the S word.  Yeah, I hope we didn't dump out of the line. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, I'm sorry.  That's right.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Go ahead, Megan.  It's time for the six o'clock queef.  Did you hear it?  Yeah, there it was.  The six o'clock queef.  The six o'clock queef.  That's right.  Three minutes late, but who cares?  How was it?  Go ahead.  A little more of the six o'clock queef, please.  A little more of it?  A little more.  I'll try.  There we go.  Like I said, you should turn this into a contest or something. 
[02:25:00]  Have a bunch of girls try.  How heavy a gal are you?  How heavy?  I got the F word.  You got the F word.  Ohio body mouth.  I'm like 5'3 and 120 pounds.  Yeah.  5'3, 120.  Just turned 18 a couple months ago.  Wow.  Wow.  That sounded a little more baritone than I was thinking.  Oh, I'm sorry.  That's fine.  Interesting.  Sounds like...  I don't know.  I'm talking to him, yeah. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  My boyfriend's sitting right here.  He can't believe it.  It's just that you can get the same sound if you go to the gas station air pump machine  and pump it between two slices of London broil.  So I was thinking, you might have been an older, more experienced gang now.  Oh, no, no.  All right, Megan, it's our new bit, the 6 o'clock queef, and you...  I started a new bit.  You started a new bit.  All right, that's cool.  Ladies, let's not forget tomorrow, the 6 o'clock queef, okay?  Right.  All right.  And tomorrow, we'll start giving out prizes. 
[02:26:00]  It'll be sponsored.  We'll get a jingle.  Could we get Jimmy to work on a little intro for the 6 o'clock queef bit?  You think I'm kidding?  This is top-shelf stuff.  Of course.  6 o'clock.  Rick, if we don't have a sweeper for the 6 o'clock queef, I'm going to be really pissed off.  Okay.  I'm writing down those words right now.  All right.  Even if Steve has to do it for us.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, not much.  How are you guys doing? 
[02:26:30]  Pretty good.  I think every day at 6 o'clock, you'd have a Frenchie call back and do a history of great French surrenders.  Can I be good?  You just have him surrender.  Oh, just surrender to everybody.  Hey, that's funny.  That's like a funny gag bit.  He calls up, and then we start getting on him, and he goes, his catchphrase, I still  in, dude.  And the call ends.  Very good.  Thank you, Mike.  Thank you.  Jingles are always funny on a radio show.  Jingles.  Well, we're hoping to get a nice jingle for the 6 o'clock, what is it, the 6 o'clock 
[02:27:00]  queef?  All the best shows have jingles.  Jingles.  Maybe by the end of the show, we'll have a few more brand new bits.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  See, it's working.  It's working out for us.  Let's go to Joe.  Joe, what's going on?  Hello?  Joe?  Yes.  I'd like to try the uh-uh game as Ed Koch.  There's one from New York.  I'd like to try a book about the new mayor.  Yeah.  Please. 
[02:27:30]  All right.  Bloomberg.  You've got to love him.  He's Jewish.  Hello?  You've got 60 seconds.  You've got to keep going.  Well, uh, I, uh, uh, uh, uh, well, uh, uh, uh, I...  Forget the joke.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh, yeah.  I want to be an overdo it guy.  Too late.  We've got three of those, right?  Called the Opie and Anthony joke.  All right, Joe.  We do have a new mayor in this town.  We are kind of notorious for having fun with the mayors. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah, well, we'll...  We've got to think of, uh, some way to maybe let Mike Bloomberg, the new mayor of New York  City, know that the O&A show is on the air here in this city.  Because you know something?  I know damn well Mayor Menino up there in Boston knows who O&A are.  I know Giuliani knows who we are because he called us stupid.  Where's the clip?  We actually have a clip, and it's, uh, Giuliani.  All he's saying is stupid. 
[02:28:30]  Well, he had a comment about the, uh, Voyabus incident.  Yeah, the Voyabus.  I got it, man.  I got it.  You do?  This was on, uh, yeah, national TV.  Stupid.  Stupid.  Stupid.  They asked him, what, uh, what do you think about the Opie and Anthony Voyabus thing?  Stupid.  That's all he said.  He did.  There is a clip of him somewhere saying, you can't drive around a busload of naked women.  It's just stupid.  Stupid.  That was when everyone hated him.  Remember that?  I think it was September 10th.  Yeah.  When everyone couldn't stand the effing guy. 
[02:29:00]  And then all of a sudden, uh, now he's going around with a halo on his head and wings.  But, uh, yeah, Bloomberg is in office now, and we really gotta kinda get his attention.  I think we get off on the wrong foot with these other mayors.  We gotta get a shoe in now, and, uh, kinda get a relationship going with him.  I like it.  Yeah.  Alright, uh, well this, I don't know if this bit will work on the show.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Yeah, I wanted to know if you wanted to play a racehorse, rock band, or adult movie. 
[02:29:30]  Whoa.  Yeah, you wanna play a racehorse, rock band, or adult movie?  I say one, and then you say whatever, whatever it is.  That's a little schlocker imitation.  I'm sorry, I got nothing, really.  Alright.  I got nothing.  I got nothing.  No, that's good, that's good, though.  Thank you.  Sorry about that, no.  We want real bits that we can start doing on our show.  The six o'clock queef, that's gonna be a huge bit.  I like that.  Give it a couple weeks, and you'll be looking forward to it every day.  Give it a couple of weeks, and it'll be taken away from us.  It'll be so much fun and so successful. 
[02:30:00]  They'll tell us we can't do it.  How about every day at 6.10, a gal comes in and drips a little salty yellow loveliness  onto a fella, and he has to get what she drank.  And I would think that guy would be you.  Well, when I'm here.  Well, when you're not touring.  Alright.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I was wondering if we were gonna do some douche or dressing.  Hey, douche or dressing.  You're ripping me off.  Ooh, ooh.  Scorch.  Stinky rules.  Alright, bye.  Alright. 
[02:30:30]  Believe it or not, we have to take another break, because we went really long.  Yeah, I want to talk about Ali, though.  I know.  We've got to talk about Ali.  We definitely will in a few minutes.  We got something, Rick?  Hold on a minute.  Did you find it?  Oh, yeah.  There's another clip from Rudy Giuliani about the lawyer bus.  Not to get to law in New York to be topless.  This city would be a disaster if you had a mayor who said,  oh, yeah, yeah, everybody can run around the streets with their clothes off.  There he is when everyone hated him. 
[02:31:00]  Back in the good old days.  There's another one?  Oh, I thought there was one.  Just that we made him have to say that.  You had a comment at a press conference.  It's against the law, and you get arrested for it.  Everybody does.  It doesn't matter if it's a stupid bus.  Stupid bus.  Stupid bus.  The bus is stupid.  Classic.  That's great.  Giuliani.  There he goes.  Godspeed.  Okay.  Yeah, best story of the day is up next. 
[02:31:30]  Muhammad Ali.  Yeah.  And my idea, Anthony, that I want to do for you.  Oh, yes.  Valentine's Day.  Hopefully we can talk about that before we get out of here.  FU line?  Sure.  Why not?  Let's go to the FU line.  Is it two?  Or B?  It's A or B?  You know, the rolly thing that cues up the bits on the shortcuts?  Yeah.  He had to roll a lot to get down to F.  Oh, God.  In alphabetical order.  It was up near A. 
[02:32:00]  We needed F.  F is involved today?  So he had to roll, roll, roll down to F for FU.  So let's go to the FU line.  Hey, thanks for calling, and here's the Opian Anthony FU line.  My name's Frank, and I'd like to say FU to my F and walrus-looking wife  who keeps getting fatter and fatter ever since we've been married.  Last night she threw a dish at me because I called her a fat cow  because she wanted me to help her wash the dishes.  You fat F and F.  Wash them yourself.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to give a big, giant, merry FU to this dumb broad behind me 
[02:32:30]  at work that's playing this ridiculous Christmas music.  Bah humbug, and go F yourself and all this stupid Christmas music.  FU.  Next message.  There's a big FU to my f*** of a boss  who could have given me the goddamn assignment at 1 o'clock,  but no, she's freaking waited until 4.30,  kept my ass at work an extra two and a half hours,  which she knows full well that I've got an hour commute ahead of me. 
[02:33:00]  It's the only time I can freaking see my kids is in the evening,  and she's got a f***ing five minute commute.  A big FU, bitch!  End of message.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  What do you do here?  Look at breasts.  If I wasn't on this show, I'd be out there with a wow stick  strolling for breasts.  I see a part of her!  Oh, yeah.  And E.W.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Are we really running a commercial for arthritis? 
[02:33:30]  John Raditz.  John Raditz?  Yeah.  This guy writes from Long Island,  how many of your listeners actually have arthritis?  I don't know.  They seem to, uh,  the testimonials seem to really, uh,  sell the product.  I wonder if that works on PlayStation 2 thumb,  because I feel like I have arthritis in my hands  after playing NHL 2002 for the last two weeks. 
[02:34:00]  Those are the testimonials.  It's great.  The woman seems to really be happy  that she's no longer in pain.  All right.  Well, I like it.  Sometimes I hurt my hands on people's heads,  and I need the joint arthritis.  Joint arthritis.  L-P-Y-H-2.  And a tire.  Well, we're hoping our listeners 
[02:34:30]  are going to help us out with the new format.  We're coming up with cute little games  and things to do on our show.  Of course.  We got one game.  It's called, uh,  but it's not even a game.  It's, uh, the 6 o'clock queef.  Yeah.  Megan started that from Ohio.  And, uh,  and we'll do it again tomorrow.  So, ladies, uh,  call in for the 6 o'clock queef.  You've got to call in around 5.50 or so  so we can be prepared, you know.  Maybe tape it to make sure  no dirty words were said 
[02:35:00]  so we can edit those out.  Edit out all that pesky spontaneity.  Maybe we can follow it up  with some kind of thematic, uh,  queef song.  How many are there?  There's got to be a few, right?  Sure.  And we're hoping to come up with, uh,  some, some, uh,  some more new bits for the format here.  Ta-ta Tuesdays.  Eh.  Punch-a-Preg-o Friday.  Edwin.  Jesus.  Come on, man.  That's insane.  The 5.59, uh,  splooge.  No. 
[02:35:30]  Uh, the third hour,  third input.  No, no, no.  That's not going to work.  Drink from the mule patriotic song game?  What the hell is that?  Oh, I hung up, though.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  You know what, though?  We'll come up with some, uh,  oh, yeah.  Some other little,  cute little games to play.  Absolutely.  Satisfied that tour.  From Maryland.  When Bernie.  All right, Anthony,  this story hit, uh,  the day we went on vacation  for Christmas, 
[02:36:00]  so it might sound a little old  for some people,  but, man, we, you know,  we have to talk about it  a little bit here.  Yeah.  It's about Muhammad Ali,  uh,  and it goes like this.  Parkinson's disease  may have reduced  his bellow to a whisper,  but Muhammad Ali's mouth  can still get him in trouble.  The 59-year-old  former heavyweight champ  stunned a gathering  in Washington  when he let loose  with jokes  guaranteed to offend  just about everybody.  Oh, equal opportunity offender.  Uh, this was an actual joke 
[02:36:30]  that Ali said  to a crowded room.  This guy,  you know,  let's do it as Ali  because I won't be a liar.  Well, the funniest part  is he can get away  with anything.  He's so pathetic now.  They, they had the,  the premiere  for his big movie there.  Ali.  With, uh,  who's playing him?  Uh, Will Smith.  Will Smith.  And there's Muhammad Ali  walking into the movie there,  and they're all like,  uh, Ali, Ali,  uh, paparazzi,  uh, give us a pose.  I saw a guy,  uh, turn around  and start laughing  his ass off  like he looked at Ali 
[02:37:00]  and then had to turn around  because he was laughing  because Ali's trying,  trying to make it look  like a boxer.  Still holding,  holding hands up in the ass.  Like a,  eek.  Like, ooh,  I'll get you,  go see,  I'll float like a,  like a high beam  and sting like a,  a cotton ball.  And he's got his arms,  he can't even hold him steady.  It's a,  and this guy,  this little munchkin guy  walking him around,  it's sad  because the guy used to be, 
[02:37:30]  I'll go,  oh, I'll go get you,  Joe Frazier.  I'll get you,  Joe Frazier.  And now,  Joe who?  You know his brain  is still there though.  Oh, is it?  Yeah,  he just can't communicate  what he's saying.  Thank you.  I still believe  it's from the decon  cargo pestisome.  So he's in a crowded,  uh,  crowded room in Washington  and he decides  to tell a couple jokes.  Here's,  uh,  his first joke.  This is the God's honest truth.  Go ahead.  As Ali.  What,  what's the difference  between a Jew  and a canoe? 
[02:38:00]  The canoe tips.  One of the,  probably one of the,  the more classic  of the anti-semitical jokes.  So he says this  in a crowded room,  the crowd,  which included  a number of Jewish people,  including Ali actor  Ron Silver,  laughed nervously.  Nervously.  But Ali wasn't thrilled.  Here was his next joke.  A black,  a Puerto Rican,  and a Mexican, 
[02:38:30]  and a car.  Who,  who's driving?  The police.  And it says,  blacks and Hispanics  in the crowd  also paid Ali  the courtesy of laughing.  Courtesy.  The Washington Post,  Lloyd Grove,  who was at the party,  reports that Ali's  fourth wife,  Lonnie,  tried to head off  his routine  as he took the mic,  pleading,  no,  no,  no,  don't.  No!  Ali's rep  admitted his humor  was politically incorrect, 
[02:39:00]  but argued,  these are not new jokes.  Oh.  Mohammed,  I know,  I understand the struggle.  Mohammed,  old jokes,  tells them all the time  because he likes  to make people laugh.  I know, Ali.  And he shocks people  to make a point.  He always manages  to diffuse any situation  that seems overly  reverential.  Reverential.  R?  Okay.  Following the film,  everybody was paying  tribute to him  and he was in a good mood.  By the way,  the premiere was a fundraiser  for blah,  blah,  blah,  blah,  blah,  blah,  blah,  blah,  blah,  blah, 
[02:39:30]  blah,  blah,  blah,  blah,  blah,  I owe my daughter money  and I'm dodging her.  I know this.  Well,  the politically incorrect jokes.  I don't know.  He's a guy that could  get away with it,  though.  Oh, yeah.  You know,  the grease man,  he didn't really tell a joke,  but, you know,  a little off-color remark there  and that's it.  Joe wants in on this.  Joe,  what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I heard Ali owes his daughter  six bucks 
[02:40:00]  and he's dodging her.  I know this one.  And he needs a new dryer door.  I think the black chick digs me.  Right,  yeah.  Thank you.  Yeah,  well,  Ali.  Yeah,  you did some other...  I'm going to take the stage again.  Well,  you were going to do some more jokes,  but they yanked you off the stage.  We have a national radio show here.  Would you like to try some of your jokes out  on the people?  A black man walked into a bar  with a parrot on his head  and the bartender asked,  where'd you get there? 
[02:40:30]  And the parrot said,  Africa,  they're everywhere.  I am the gravest.  Oh, God.  What do you call crime fighting in Harlem?  Uh, what?  Abortion.  What?  Abortion.  Ali, 
[02:41:00]  how's your Mercedes going?  I knew it.  I'm going to go  hundreds of thousands of miles.  Yeah.  You notice there are no black people  in the Jensen's.  The future looks great.  The future looks great.  And you didn't understand  the setup,  Ali.  How do you fix  a woman's watch?  Oh.  You don't.  There's a clock on the oven. 
[02:41:30]  Why?  Why is she the one  that's more than I tell her?  Why?  He doesn't know  he's planning.  Wow.  They really liked that one, Ali.  What do you call a pimple  on one in Italian? 
[02:42:00]  A what?  Like a grease fitter.  A lot of black people  in her flat nose.  Oh, wait, we heard that one.  Yeah, we heard that earlier.  Earlier.  Yeah.  When I go in the Italians  and have freckles.  What?  They all slide on.  How did the Polish mother  teach her son  which way to put on 
[02:42:30]  his underwear?  How?  Yeah.  Yellow in the front,  brown in the back.  I got a million of them.  I got a million of them.  Anyway,  what do you get  when you're close  to an Italian  and a Poland?  Huh?  You got to make  an offer  you can't understand. 
[02:43:00]  What does a black man  get for Christmas?  What does a black man  get for Christmas?  Your bicycle.  Wow.  What's right  with a black a-hole?  What?  The A-team. 
[02:43:30]  The big yellow ones  the sun.  No, that's  Brian Regan's big.  That's Brian Regan's  big time.  What did you do?  Did you hear  about the new  black French restaurant?  No, I did not.  It's called  Shea Watt.  What did Lincoln say  after a five-day drunk? 
[02:44:00]  I freed the whole?  What's the definition  of a black foreplay?  Oh, well.  Don't scream  or I'll kill you.  How does an Italian girl  shave their legs?  What?  What?  I didn't understand.  How does an Italian girl  shave their legs?  Oh, shave.  They lay down on the side  and have someone moan.  And I'll kill you. 
[02:44:30]  I'll kill you.  I'll kill you.  It's deco-fum-on.  How do you  stop a black baby  from crying  by this whole gang?  No, no, no, no, no.  Let's yank you  on Muhammad  off the stage.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  Pope says, Pope wrote C words.  No, that's Otto and George's joke. 
[02:45:00]  In the conscious.  No, that's Otto and George.  What did the two Jews say each other?  If we walk through the world, we'd have all the orders.  I know the struggle.  I know the struggle.  What do you call a black man with no arms?  Oh, my God.  Show us the weather.  Oh, my God.  Mohammed.  Well, these are all, you know, but I am the great one. 
[02:45:30]  They're smoldering, Joe Frazier.  What do you say to a black man wearing a suit?  Oh, my God.  Will the defendant please rise?  Thank God you're black, Mohammed.  Yeah, I'm so glad.  All right, I notice there's an orange in the man of black, too.  How do you get a one-on-pole on the other between? 
[02:46:00]  Oh.  You're way better.  All right, well, look at that.  Thank you, Mohammed.  Thank you.  Depends on how slashed, then you slings him.  Oh, yeah.  No, don't just start doing the wrong lines, man.  What's the difference between a Batman and a black man? 
[02:46:30]  What?  Batman can go to the store without ramping.  They have to pick cotton to get to them.  No, no, Mohammed.  Mohammed.  Because they're Negroes.  No, no.  What's the...  So birds don't crap on their neck. 
[02:47:00]  No, no, Mohammed.  What's that?  Good.  Thank you, Mohammed.  Imagine that crap turns white and stops stinking.  No, thank you.  What's the problem, you sir?  Thank you.  We're going to play What Do We Learn?  On the Open Anthony Show today.  Okay.  And we're going to do that after a very short break.  Thank you, Mohammed.  Thank you.  Yes, go get an F in the air and wipe your D on the curtain. 
[02:47:30]  Nothing you already told are 20.  All right, thank you.  Thank you.  Two in the front, two in the back, six million in the answer.  Ah, Jamie, what's up?  They're walking.  Jamie.  They just kicked you guys off the radio like four times in Cleveland.  What?  Yeah, they just cut out like four times. 
[02:48:00]  We'll see.  Is that true?  That's what they...  I'm sitting here listening to it.  It keeps going, bleep, cutting out, and then coming back about two seconds later.  All right.  Thank you.  They're probably having problems with the satellite.  All right, maybe.  Maybe a snowstorm coming through.  Say hi, I hope not.  All right, Jamie.  Thanks.  What, Mohammed?  Two Mexican kids don't pay any island.  No.  They'll stick dark milk around in the ceiling. 
[02:48:30]  You're awful, man.  I am provincial.  No, no.  From the pepper spray.  No.  Beware the eyepiece of your rifle.  Of Father's Day.  Let the record state that Earl is laughing. 
[02:49:00]  So they don't bite their fingers when eating Twisky Rose.  What do we learn next on the O.P. and Anthony show?  I'm French Managing.  Break it down.

And we need to spend some time with this new idea.  A cool new contest for the virgins out there.  Yeah.  Details tomorrow.  All right, let's go right to the phones. 
[02:50:30]  Kevin, what's going on?  Yeah.  First soundbite of the year was crown, hat, curly hair, smile, and face.  Oh, very good.  Peace out, guys.  Thank you.  Norton, you suck.  Norton, you suck.  George, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Welcome back.  And I learned that you guys start vacation again tomorrow.  No, no, no.  We'll be all right.  Hell no.  No, no, no.  And listen, if you do, can I put in my request for the robot interview?  Again, the funniest thing I've ever heard.  Did we replay that over?  I guess we did. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, man.  I got to tell you.  The best.  Oh, good.  The guy that was the robot, but not the robot.  No, it couldn't have been any for you.  Cool.  Thanks, George.  See you later, guys.  All right, bye.  Oh, remember Day Late Guy?  Day Late Guy?  Day Late Guy.  Check it in.  Yes, Day Late Guy.  What's up?  Oh, hey.  How are you guys doing?  I wanted to welcome you back.  Wish you a happy new year.  Thank you.  And I know you guys have your pulse on the city.  I need to ask you something.  I had a problem last night.  I went down to Times Square to watch the ball drop last night, and the place was barren. 
[02:51:30]  I figured the place would have 200,000, 300,000 people.  Day Late Guy.  That was the day before.  You were a Day Late.  You're a Day Late Day Late Guy.  Oh, that explains it.  I didn't see anything on the news.  And that explains why you guys are working today.  I figured you'd have the holiday off.  Now I get it.  You're a Day Late on everything.  I understand.  All right.  Thank you.  Okay.  I'll talk to you guys later.  There he goes.  Day Late Guy.  Andre, what's up? 
[02:52:00]  Happy New Year, boys.  Happy New Year.  I learned a couple things.  I learned Norton didn't spend $400 on a handgun for nothing.  And I also learned it's not A or B. It's the twisty thing.  It was the twisty thing today.  It was the twisty thing today that caused the little delay.  Very good.  You boys rock.  Thank you.  Later.  Yeah, it's good to be back.  We needed that little rest.  Gary learned that O.P. turns fresh powder over family gatherings.  That's true.  Dennis, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey. 
[02:52:30]  I learned between earth science, video games, and talking about the weather, nobody's going  to get laid today.  Well, yeah.  All right, boys.  Stinky rolls.  All right, bye.  Let's go to Pete.  Pete, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  I learned Norton knows too much about hookers in Nevada.  You're right, sir.  Well, it's true.  All right, later.  Thank you.  Let's see what Jeff learned.  Jeff, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned a couple things.  One, Shore Commercials Rock, and Stinky's real name is Garrett. 
[02:53:00]  That's true.  The young Garrett.  Yeah.  He also has the best bud, though.  Cool.  Thanks, Jeff.  Peace.  Peace.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Happy New Year.  Happy New Year.  Happy New Year.  Yeah.  What I learned today is that you actually can make fun of the moon cricket to make the  movie of your Muhammad Ali.  Hello?  Hello.  Hello.  Thank you. 
[02:53:30]  I love silent games.  He's got to turn it up.  What happened?  I thought it was on the radio.  Wait.  Adam from Massachusetts.  I learned that Barney music makes you feel guilty after you've done something bad.  Gooch from the city.  I learned that Opie's Islanders on NHL 2002 probably have a better chance at the Stanley  Golf.  I don't know what I'm saying.  I don't know what I'm saying.  Chest up from the roof.  Oh, Jim Brewer coming in tomorrow.  I'm speaking of the week. 
[02:54:00]  Will, the pill that makes your stuff taste like fruit is just awful.  It takes the degradation, humiliation, and tears out of it.  What's the sound, Norton?  I forget.  It was...  Why?  John from Hamburg, PA.  That's too much.  I learned that Batman can go to the store without Robin.  Enigma from Boston.  Today I learned that if it sounds like a bird but smells like catfish, it must be six o'clock. 
[02:54:30]  Glad that went cool.  Let's go to Doug from Springfield.  Doug, what's going on?  I heard if Schlocko was listening to the show today, he has enough material for a whole year.  For his whole radio career.  Puha, puha, puha, puha.  Later, guys.  Die, die, sir.  Uncle John, Happy New Year.  Hey, Happy New Year, guys.  How you doing?  Good. 
[02:55:00]  Hey, I learned one thing.  I learned that if you do the math in your head, you want to run home to your mom and suckle.  Yeah, that's so true, man.  Later, guys.  That's so true.  It's on the same lines as Mike from the Bronx.  I learned 10 million years of evolution equals blip, whoosh, gone.  Skidmark from Jersey.  You guys pick up on everything.  Today I learned that kneecap cancer is funnier.  Testicular cancer has that impact.  That impact.  You said that right now.  Trevor from Boston. 
[02:55:30]  Allie and Voss traded material at the Rumble in the Jungle.  I learned that the photographer from Maxim sucks at telling stories.  He's the worst.  Peter, what's going on?  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  I learned how to boo a really bad movie.  Boo.  I mean, really.  Boo.  Where are you guys?  Dave, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, I learned that we are all raindrops on the windshield with the wipers on high. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  And you guys rule, man.  No one you rule.  Thank you, mister.  You guys rock.  Later.  Thank you.  Bob, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned that the black girl in the corner with the Idaho potato bag is the hooker.  Listen to me.  Hey, can I try to stump you guys with a joke real fast?  We don't have our joke music set up.  Ah, that's all right.  No, it's not.  It's a quick one. 
[02:56:30]  Um, no.  All right.  Um, no.  I don't think so.  I ain't reading that.  Another Rick inappropriate written thing?  No, so I don't send it in.  I learned that...  Bad Max?  I learned that Muhammad Ali has a better act than Rich Voss.  He's not even here to defend himself today.  I'm talking to you.  You went to see Voss for New Year's Eve, didn't you?  That wasn't good. 
[02:57:00]  Brand new material for 2002?  I had two new jokes.  Two new jokes, Adam.  He said he had two new jokes he was bringing in.  I got two more.  New jokes.  That's what you did New Year's Eve?  I didn't just hang out with Voss, dude.  Two new jokes.  The insider and the bike hushed him.  I'm just trying to go through these real fast.  Aaron from Philly, here's a new bit game for your newly formatted show.  We are looking for new bits.  Definitely.  The 620 Ali Comedy Quarter Hour. 
[02:57:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. </pre>
