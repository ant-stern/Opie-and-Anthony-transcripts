<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts complaining about a harsh winter and then shifting to the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappearance, criticizing the airline's impersonal text message to families.  They then discussed the Washington state mudslide, initially confused about casualty numbers.  A tangent on the physics of tides and waves followed, fueled by a caller who challenged their oceanography knowledge.  The conversation then moved to Nick Cannon's album "White People Party Music" and the controversy surrounding his whiteface photos.  Listeners called in with corrections and additional information, including details about Louis Zamperini and his upcoming biopic.  The segment ended with a discussion of a base-jumping video from One World Trade Center.

The next segment started with the hosts trying to identify a video of a crumbling mountain walkway, eventually confirming its location in China.  A caller, "Birdman," discussed alcoholic beverages.  The hosts then detailed the walkway's perilous condition, with a caller later providing historical context about its 1901 construction for a hydroelectric plant.  Another caller mentioned Hawaii's "Stairway to Heaven." The topic then shifted to trophy hunting, sparked by a picture of a woman with a killed giraffe.  The hosts expressed disgust, discussing "canned hunts" and the ethics of hunting. Callers offered varying perspectives, leading to a debate on the NFL's acceptance of Michael Vick compared to its strict rules on language, prompting a broader discussion on societal acceptance of different forms of animal cruelty. The segment concluded with further discussion of Nick Cannon's album promotion and its perceived offensiveness, touching on white and black privilege and a tangent about Greg Hughes' perceived lack of high school recognition.

The following segment focused on a list of notable alumni from Opie's high school, Harborfields High School. Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton joked about the listed individuals, using the term "mushroom stamping" to describe being surpassed in fame by a fellow alumnus.  Many names were mentioned, including athletes, artists (Cindy Sherman), a playwright (Charles Ludlum), a country singer (Brian Daniels), a voice actress (Brittany Lauda), Jeff Hawkins, Anthony Cumia, Cousin Sal, a midget politician (Paul Stephen Miller), and Tim Howard. Opie discovered he was listed twice as the number one alumnus on the school's Wikipedia page, surpassing Mariah Carey.  The segment then transitioned to music, with the hosts playing and criticizing Nick Cannon's "Pajama Pants," Corey Feldman's "Duh," and Farrah Abraham's "Blowing."  They also discussed Jerry Springer's apology for using the word "tranny," sparking a debate about the offensiveness of the term. The segment concluded with discussion of Jeff Dunham's friendship with Bruce Jenner, his RC helicopter hobby (including a near-fatal accident), and a planned segment involving older women smelling their buttocks.

The final segment featured comedian Jeff Dunham as a guest.  They discussed Dunham's drone experience, his appearance on *Keeping Up with the Kardashians*, and his new animated special, *Achmed Saves America*.  Dunham detailed his world tour and discussed the ambiguous nature of Achmed's religious background, aiming to avoid offense. He also talked about his use of 3D printers, his experiences with the Kardashians, and his career, including his most successful characters (Achmed and Peanut) and his early career. The hosts and Dunham reminisced about the golden age of stand-up comedy.  A caller from Syracuse reported that Dunham is the number one American comedian in Saudi Arabia due to Achmed. Dunham recounted the creation of Achmed, originally based on Osama bin Laden but later altered.  The discussion also touched upon smartwatches and other technological advancements, concluding with Dunham promoting his upcoming show and tour dates, alongside Jim Norton's appearances.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  For this palaver, let's get the show on the road.  Yes, good morning everybody.  Hi, hi everybody.  Welcome.  How's everyone this grand morning, huh?  Oh, just wonderful.  Nice, what was it, 19 degrees?  It was at 21, I couldn't tell.  It was fucking cold.  I was one of those people about two to three weeks ago  that was making fun of all the people  that are saying enough with this winter  and enough with this cold, but...  Enough!  I've had it.  This is unbelievable.  Every morning, walking out that door 
[00:00:30]  and just breathing in freezing cold air.  Yeah.  And it just doesn't end.  Yeah.  Doesn't end.  And what, we got another storm coming today?  A couple inches just to show you who's boss?  Right, right.  Just a little reminder, since all the snow is gone.  Yeah.  Just a little more to throw in there to screw everything up.  And then cold the rest of the week until Friday.  Had it.  And then I think Friday will finally be it.  But I've said this in my, you know, regular life a million times. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  Like, no, I think this is it.  No, I think this is it finally.  I think we're through.  I think we're over the hump.  I think.  I think it's going to be 50 on Wednesday.  I think it's finally over.  No.  It's unbelievable.  I can't remember the last time we had a winter that was this just horrible.  It seems like it's just going on forever.  Yeah.  It won't fucking end.  It started early.  Yeah.  New York's not used to this crap.  We're fucking pussies when it comes to cold weather.  We really are.  It's a little expanded. 
[00:01:30]  Because I've lived in colder places.  I mean, when we were up in Boston, that was a lot colder than here.  Yeah.  When I lived in Rochester, Buffalo.  But for some reason, this winter is just annoying.  It's never fucking ending.  Right around.  I look at my back door.  Yeah.  The fucking slider.  And I'm just like, come on!  You would be open up.  Are you opening your pool April 1st?  I am still on an April 1st schedule.  Jesus, really?  To open my pool.  I don't care how cold it is out.  You might be ice skating on that night.  At least the jacuzzi will work, you know. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  Bubble away in the freezing cold.  Well, at least we don't have a mudslide to deal with.  Oh, boy.  That's ugly singing.  You see CNN?  They're adjusting finally.  Are they pulling off of the old airplanes?  They're getting that asshole out of the flight simulator.  Yeah.  Is he in a mud simulator?  Oh, they'll find something.  Something for him?  Something creative.  But they're trying to move to the mudslide story now.  They're trying.  They're a little.  They're still like, they're getting pissed at those Malaysians. 
[00:02:30]  Right.  At those Malaysians for coming out.  First of all, they text the families.  Oh, I know.  Of the fucking Vivek.  That all lives were lost?  I got to tell you something.  There are some countries, and a lot of them over there in Asia, Malaysia is one of them.  Right.  That just, I don't think they have the mindset we have as Americans or as Europeans even or something.  There's just this straight business like, text them.  Right. 
[00:03:00]  Right.  And you're like, the easiest way to get the word out.  Right.  And you're like.  Technically it is.  Who would think?  It is.  Right.  Technically it is.  Instead of making what?  200 and whatever phone calls.  But again, there's just zero emotion involved with it.  It's pretty insane.  They're probably scared to do it in person.  Those people are so pissed off.  They're probably afraid.  Yeah.  They're probably going to be killed.  Not a phone call.  No, there's something else going on there.  It's not just that they're pissed off, because anyone would be pissed off in that situation.  Like, it is even, if dare I say this, it's even more devastating, because those people 
[00:03:30]  can only have one kid.  Oh, wow.  Really?  They've brought up that angle many times.  Yes.  You can only have one kid.  Wow.  So that is like it.  You can't lean on maybe the other kids you've had.  Right, right, right.  And they're now too old to, you know, have another kid.  There's things that people try to do to get through, you know, these horrendous tragedies.  But they're saying it hurts even more because of the one kid rule for a lot of these families. 
[00:04:00]  And then that whole fucking thing with the, like, there's no real proof yet.  Right.  They have some kind of satellite data and no real, no wreckage at all.  Right.  No proof that the plane is in the bottom of the ocean.  Right.  You can assume, you can make a good assumption, but to come out with such solid concrete,  plane gone, people dead.  Right.  In a text.  Yeah, yeah.  In a text.  Wow.  It's like.  And what happened to that debris yesterday? 
[00:04:30]  That was a bust now?  A ship went there and found nothing.  Again.  Another bust.  Another bust.  There's a huge storm going on in the search area now, so they're not searching.  Yeah.  But then they say no survivors.  But then, like, one of the satellite pictures are like, that could be a raft.  Or it could be this.  So there's still so much speculation.  Why would you just come out and go, bah?  Yeah, I don't know.  There's no food or water for three weeks, though?  You're finished.  Oh, no.  They're done.  There have been people that have survived. 
[00:05:00]  And on...  You would have to be floating right next to all the provisions for that plane.  All your good shit for the plane.  You would have to have an incredible luck.  There are provisions in the life rafts.  Right.  But for how long?  That's just it.  You know, how many people are there?  Right.  How long...  I think enough to have a little snack.  How economical can people be with their survival of goods?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Goods.  Oh, okay.  Exactly.  You've seen the cupcakes when they come through this place. 
[00:05:30]  Just imagine you're on the ocean now.  Yeah, yeah.  Those are the same people.  You've got to start racking some heads.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  That's going to happen.  Throwing people overboard.  That's going to happen.  But there's, you know, supposedly some things there that you could improvise, maybe do some fishing, purify water.  People have miraculously survived on the open ocean for a very long time.  Not that part of the ocean.  They're reminding us it's the worst part of the world to have a plane crash.  God, I've learned a lot. 
[00:06:00]  Bad place down there.  I now know the worst place in the world to have a plane crash.  There's nothing down there.  And then CNN, they did something that all news channels do.  It's not bad enough.  It's in the Indian Ocean.  Now they're showing stock footage of, like, I don't know, 20, 25-foot waves.  Oh, giant storms.  And they wait for a minute or two, and they go, well, this isn't the actual, this isn't what's going on now.  But this is what that ocean has the potential to do.  So the searchers could be dealing with this. 
[00:06:30]  They could be dealing with seas that we're seeing here from 20-year-old footage.  But they sneak it on at first.  And let you think, wow, they're searching in that right now?  I don't know.  That's horrible.  Me and Ann were just watching CNN just before the show.  I swear to you, I thought it was a repeat.  Yeah, I know.  They were saying the same shit.  And the left turn, right with the left turn.  Well, the transponders, I prefer not it be called a zombie plane. 
[00:07:00]  If you want to talk to me as an expert, stop saying zombie plane.  You could say ghost plane.  Right.  Ghost plane, I'll accept.  God damn it.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  And then the flight simulator guy.  Enough already.  But it's working for them.  Their ratings are really, really good.  Are they good?  And they're way up because of the coverage they're doing.  Oh, there's the fucking left turn again.  Wait, wait.  Where's it going to go?  It looks so stupid. 
[00:07:30]  It turns like a lazy Susan.  Where's the, give me some garlic salt.  They've shown that animation so many times.  I bet you there are people out there that are convinced that's how planes turn.  I never felt that.  The back swings out like that.  It's like you're in a bumper car.  Exactly.  And now this guy.  Well, let me get back on the map.  We now call it the Southern Corridor.  Oh, now it's called the Southern Corridor.  Are they standing on the map?  Oh, you want to see the big map? 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Oh, this is wonderful.  It's got a little CGI on it.  The plane's flying by their feet.  Kick it.  Step on it.  Bullshit.  Here and visualize the satellite up.  Yeah, visualize.  And it's communicating.  It's saying, I'm here.  Why do they have to stand on the map?  And then it sends something back.  Why is the plane is not saying I am.  Almost as big as Australia, though.  That doesn't make sense.  If that plane was that big, they'd find it.  They sure would.  This is specifically what aircraft I am.  And now they've reanalyzed this data that they've had for a few weeks now.  I hate the floor map.  And determined they didn't know.  Oh, they're all not the floor map. 
[00:08:30]  They use it for a lot of things now.  In a long history, it was sending back those handshakes.  Correct.  Correct.  And that's...  But remember, this satellite has never before been used for directional, for finding anything.  Fox has moved on.  MSNBC has moved on.  Not CNN.  I mean, scientists there at MRSAT did.  And I spoke with some of those scientists myself.  Have you?  CNN just knows, like, I don't know.  We're running with this.  We're doing good.  Let it ride.  Oh, boy.  So, what's the latest there?  I didn't even look.  Again, I mean, if you called off the text for the day. 
[00:09:00]  What did the text say?  I'd love to know that.  All lives are lost.  Just that?  Pretty much.  Plane is...  I don't know the exact text, but it was pretty much in something like that.  Plane is in the Indian Ocean.  Went down to the Indian Ocean.  No survivors.  People said that what bothered them was the sad face emoticon.  The little...  The little...  Oh, my God.  They didn't care for that.  Sad face emoji.  Oh, yeah.  They just called them emoji.  I don't have any emojis.  They just want those people to leave that hotel, I guess. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  They don't want to deal with their sorrow.  No.  God forbid they deal with a family's sorrow.  Do you want the text?  It's probably very annoying.  What is the text, sir?  Malaysia Airlines deeply regrets that we have to assume beyond any reasonable doubt that  MH370 has been lost and that none of those on board survived.  As you will hear in the next hour from Malaysia's Prime Minister, we must now accept all evidence  suggests the plane went down in the southern Indian Ocean.  Oh, boy.  Maybe everyone signed up for the group text. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Maybe they requested it.  They're defending it by saying that they wanted to tell everyone involved before it went out on the news.  So by sending a mass text to everyone, all families, they were able to do that before they got it out on the news.  Well, it's certainly efficient.  We all know that.  Yeah.  Yeah, but the whole laughter thing, the ROR was just...  Oh, ROR. 
[00:10:30]  I don't know.  What are you going to do?  Yeah.  And then, yeah, we got the mudslide.  Well, I guess a lot more people are missing than first...  Well, we got 14 dead over there from the mudslide.  And how many are missing?  Did they say 90?  90 are missing?  I don't know.  How many people are missing over there?  90.  Man.  It was 20, I thought.  I thought it was four dead and 18 missing was the last count I had.  What happened? 
[00:11:00]  We got 14 dead.  You know me.  I keep count.  I'm terrible.  Four dead and 18 missing, right?  I'm just blurring things out.  This says, as of late last night, 14 people were dead and another 176 were unaccounted for.  176!  I don't think you can survive in mud for too long.  No.  Four seconds.  Yeah, that gets a bit heavy.  It's a little weighty and wet.  You ever sink down to your knee in mud and try to get out?  They say it's very quick sandy.  That's just to your knee.  Very quick sandy and silty. 
[00:11:30]  Really?  Yeah.  That shit just fucking...  That sucks.  A chunk of earth just slid.  But it is amazing that shit doesn't happen more often.  Right.  You would think.  You'd think like the earth is just sitting there.  It's a big pile of dirt.  A big pile of dirt.  It's getting pounded by the weather.  You would assume it's really loosening things up.  I don't know.  Mmm.  So...  I always like when there's a storm and a bunch of beachfront property gets wiped out or things  like that. 
[00:12:00]  You think how huge the earth is and where the land meets the water.  Right.  And how slightly it has to move to wreck a house that's on the beach.  Right.  But it doesn't very often.  Right.  I mean, to me, that should happen every day.  And then we rebuild the beaches.  Yeah.  Instead of saying, oh, this is what the ocean wants to do now.  Yeah.  You should just accept what the ocean wants to do now.  Right.  And then, you know, there'll be another area to build houses, I guess.  Like, the way the ocean... 
[00:12:30]  For how huge the ocean is, waves should go inland anywhere between, like, 600 miles and  fucking, like, one foot.  I know.  And everywhere in between, it's giant.  The earth's spinning around.  It's fucking tides and waves and fucking...  Oceans are thousands of miles across.  And they barely move a couple of feet.  And that's where it hits the beach.  And high tide's like, wait, I think it's high tide.  Well, I'm not really sure about what.  It came up six whole feet.  Right.  I think it's high tide now.  Oh, 600 miles.  It really should. 
[00:13:00]  It should be crazy.  I think all that water would just push.  Fucking things hurtling through space 25,000 miles an hour.  Right, right.  It's flying around.  There's water on it.  I can't get a glass of water to my fucking couch.  Right.  Without it flying.  Oh, by the way, I don't drink water.  Exactly.  Get a glass of wine to my...  You can't get that because your glasses don't recognize the fluid.  But high tide's 20 feet, 30 feet difference.  That's it.  You're right.  It's crazy.  Yeah, this earth is fucking nuts.  Isn't the moon what makes the... 
[00:13:30]  That is pretty fascinating.  The moon.  Yeah.  The moon makes the waves.  Yeah.  The gravitational pull.  All that happening.  Yeah, yeah.  The tides.  It moves a little bit.  Yeah.  It's so slight when you look at it on a global scale like that.  Yep.  We should never know where the beach is.  We should never know where the beach is.  You're right.  Where's the beach?  I don't know.  Hopefully not in my yard.  I'm not sure where it is this weekend, but I want to go there.  Anyone know?  Yeah, I think it's 200 miles to the south.  Yeah.  I think. 
[00:14:00]  Word has it.  What do you guys think of Nick Cannon?  What is this?  The white face?  I don't care.  As a white person, I don't give a fuck.  See, we white people are so good, we don't even care when you guys put on a white face.  But, man, a white guy does the same thing with the black face, and they want his career over.  He has the news covering Nick Cannon's white face a lot?  Have they talked about it?  Have they?  Yeah, I mean, I heard about it on the news.  Hey, your boy Nick Cannon there. 
[00:14:30]  What happened?  Yeah, that's Sam's boy.  That's Sam's boy.  What happened?  That's my boy.  He's getting controversial.  You think that's what he...  Because that seems to me like he knows better, like he knows what he's doing.  Yeah, he's getting headlines.  Eddie Murphy did it on SNL for sketches.  Chappelle used to do it all the time, and it was fucking hilarious.  Yeah, the Wayans brothers did it.  Eddie Murphy has done it.  Yeah, Eddie Murphy has done it.  It's for his album.  Let me tell you something.  Because his album is called White People Party Music.  Black guys in white face look ridiculously silly. 
[00:15:00]  They look like fucking some type of alien.  They pick the wrong hair always.  Isn't that the same hair they all kind of use?  Yeah.  It's like a reddish...  They want to be very white.  Strawberry blondish.  Yeah, it's terrible.  It's horrendous.  They have black hair, so they're tired of it.  Right, yeah.  So they should be let me be blonde, even for this silly photo shoot.  Oh, I don't like Nick Cannon at all.  Oh, boy.  Why not?  I don't know why.  He's a nice guy.  Remember when he came in here and he was fessing up to all his radio shenanigans? 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, he's actually a nice dude.  What are you?  He fessed up that he had no business trying a radio show?  Well, he sat here while we were making fun of all his...  Hey, Sam, calm down.  I don't understand that's your boy.  Whoa, Sam.  You know, you come to his defense like that.  I know.  He's like a jealous lover all of a sudden.  But, yeah, I don't mind that he did this at all.  Because he knows this is going to be a problem and he's doing it anyway, so good for him.  Yeah.  I think he's hokey.  What is it, an album?  It's a bit hokey.  Yeah, it's called White People Party Music.  What is that? 
[00:16:00]  White People Party Music.  What's the first song off it?  Let me find it.  I want black people party music.  Do we have gunfire CDs?  Whoa.  I could just play because it seems to happen a lot.  But the outrage over guys that do this in blackface is just silly.  Yeah.  His tweet was, it's official.  I'm white.  White People Party Music.  In stores April 1st.  Dude, go get it.  Join the party.  All right.  Dude.  And there's a context to blackface also, like that.  You know, he's doing a whiteface thing.  If you're doing some Al Jolson blackface, mammy stuff, that could be offensive, obviously. 
[00:16:30]  If you're doing that, like, you know, black to the future float that those cops did years ago, that's going to piss you off.  But if you are legitimately trying to imitate a black person and put on makeup or prosthetics to look like a black person.  Yeah, like, what's his name?  What was that movie?  Tropic Thunder?  Tropic Thunder, right?  He didn't really get any shit for that, though, did he?  I don't think he did.  No, he didn't.  A couple of people said something, but they were, you know, pushed aside. 
[00:17:00]  Again, it's in context.  He's also tweeting, bro, I got drafted.  Bro?  Because all white people say bro and dude.  Bro and dude.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Hold on.  And Ralph has a problem with our little silly high tide bit we just did.  Okay, Ralph.  Ralph, what's the problem?  Well, I just, I feel bad for you because everybody's going to be slopping at the beach this summer.  It'll be knowing that you live at the Bay of Fundy in the summer.  20 and 30 foot tides?  Where do you go to the beach? 
[00:17:30]  Who said that?  I thought I said it's like six.  I said 20 or 30 foot tide changes, meaning between.  Yeah.  In a storm it happens.  What are you talking about?  Those are extreme circumstances.  Yeah, maybe in a storm, but not every day.  Yeah.  The high tide every day is like maybe five feet.  From low tide?  Yeah, from low tide to high.  From low tide to high tide, most Long Island beaches are more than five feet.  What are you talking about?  Are you talking depth or up the beach?  We're talking the tide line.  You're talking up the beach, like if you measure from low tide when you hit the water and then high tide where the little seaweed line comes up. 
[00:18:00]  We just threw the number out.  I'm guessing the average Long Island beach is about 20, 30 feet between high tide and low tide, if I had to guess.  If you give it, you've got to be able to take it.  We're here to give it to you.  We were just talking about that.  Yeah, no shit.  Take what?  You're the idiot.  Take it.  You're not listening.  20 to 30 feet.  You're not saying it right.  Don't fucking blame me.  What did I say wrong? 
[00:18:30]  If you talk about a change in tide, you'll talk about how far the fucking water goes up the sand.  You talk about vertical height?  That's a tide change.  That's how you measure.  Oh, my God.  I'm talking as a layman.  When you walk the beach, you go, oh, low tide was down over there, and now high tide is up here.  So it's 20 feet up further.  Thank you.  I'm assuming you mean how far.  You're not the height of the actual wave.  Of course not.  Are you trying to get something going because I'm not in the mood, you idiot. 
[00:19:00]  Let's say it's low tide, right?  You know exactly what I was trying to say.  Yeah.  You're at the low tide mark.  Will you listen?  You might learn something, Ralph.  There's two ways to look at it.  If you're at low tide and you're at the low tide mark, and then high tide comes in, and you're still standing at the low tide mark, how high is the water on your body?  It's probably going to be up to your neck, maybe, whereas it was at your feet.  Right.  So that's like a four-foot tideway.  Probably four or five feet.  But if you now look at where the low tide mark is and then the high tide mark on the beach, it could be upwards of 20, 30 feet further. 
[00:19:30]  And that was the whole bit because we're talking about how much the water would go on land.  Thank you.  That's why the bit worked.  It wasn't an amazing bit.  It was a stupid throwaway, Ralph.  We weren't trying to discuss how deep the water gets, and then you could calculate yourself.  I only talk about depth.  That's me.  All right, Jimmy.  And it just keeps babbling.  What, Ralph?  We're not fucking meteorologists or oceanographic institute workers here.  Yes, we're radio broadcasters. 
[00:20:00]  So we're not even here.  There's no 1% of people that don't realize that high tide is measured in vertical feet.  No.  No.  How many times have you said that at a party and then realized you were talking to yourself?  Like, how many people have walked away politely at a party while you said that?  There's got to be a marine biologist about our bit.  We're talking in layman terms.  When you're walking a beach, you see what the low tide line is and the high tide line is.  He was angry that day, my friends.  Thanks, Ralph.  Loser.  Go away, loser. 
[00:20:30]  Good old man trying to send back soup at the deli.  Jerry on Long Island.  Jerry.  Hooray.  Yes.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  You are kind of wrong about the high tide thing.  Come on.  It's endless with these idiots.  I've been living on this island all my life, dude.  The most you're going to get on a normal high tide cycle is maybe eight feet.  That's it.  Yeah.  And then Jimmy did say, Jimmy said that the moon makes the waves.  Wait, eight feet?  Eight feet from what to what? 
[00:21:00]  From your low water to your high water mark.  That's not how you measure time.  Are we talking about?  That's exactly how you measure time.  He actually means on the beach line.  On the beach line?  I have literally seen low tide and high tide on Long Island upwards of 30 feet.  Thank you.  Longer.  No chance.  Maybe during a hurricane or something.  Oh, my God.  No, no.  What?  I don't have eyes?  Again, are you talking the low tide mark on the beach and then the high tide mark on the beach?  Not water depth.  We're talking the seaweed.  It goes from here to here. 
[00:21:30]  How many feet is that?  I have walked out 30 feet with fucking horseshoe crabs and rocks and seaweed.  But this idiot's saying it's only eight feet.  Is it only eight feet everywhere?  No, you have to measure the depth of the water.  We just went through this.  We understand, but for our stupid bit, it was where the water is at, low tide and high tide.  And that's why it made sense, because then they're saying that that distance should be way the fuck more.  Right.  Thousands of feet or whatever the fuck. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, exactly.  That's why the stupid, silly, throwaway bit worked.  But what are you saying, sir?  We're not having a marine biology discussion right now.  All I'm saying is that Jimmy did say that the moon creates the waves.  The moon doesn't create the waves.  The waves are created by the bottom of the contour of the ocean going up.  The water's forced up, and that's how you get waves.  But hold on, what is the gravitational pull between the moon and the earth does have something to do with the waves?  No, it does not. 
[00:22:30]  The waves are created by the contour of the bottom of the ocean.  All right, let me ask you this, marine biologist.  So when we have a full moon, why does the water come up a little more?  Because the moon is so big, it creates that draw that's so drastic one way or the other.  You're talking about, first of all, you're talking about beach waves, sir.  When energy comes to the beach in the wave, then you're going to get, in the shallows, the wave forms, the curl, and then you get your beach wave.  We're talking about waves in the middle of the ocean. 
[00:23:00]  Those are also created by contours on the bottom of the ocean.  When you have elevation of 100 feet raised at the bottom of the ocean floor, that water's got to go somewhere.  It's created by a few things.  That's one of them.  But there's also wind.  It's got nothing to do with the moon.  Wind makes waves.  You don't think tidal fluctuation makes the water move in waves?  The waves.  I'm talking about the wave height.  The wave height has nothing to do with the moon.  The moon creates the tides going in and going out.  The waves are not created by the moon. 
[00:23:30]  That's not true, sir.  The sun and the moon, there is something.  It's not true.  It's so true.  No, it's not.  The gravitational pull.  I'm reading it right now.  The gravitational pull of the moon and the sun and the Earth's oceans is the major force involved in the creation of tides.  It is.  Tides.  You said tides.  I'm talking about waves.  Tides, baby.  Waves, baby.  You said.  What's the difference between tides and waves?  Tides is the movement of water from one area to the other.  A wave.  Oh, my God.  I'm talking about the water moving, sir.  That's what we're talking about. 
[00:24:00]  How did we get here?  Hold on a minute.  Hold on.  Ken wants in on this discussion very badly.  Hold on.  Kenivich, go ahead.  Hey, Ralphie.  I'm going to do a tricksy tonight.  If you don't shut the fuck up.  Well, Ralphie's gone, so that's a bust.  Oops.  It's Jerry.  Why would Ralph care if he does Trixie?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Wrong references.  It's like that.  It's Ed Norton's.  Jerry.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Alice.  It's too early for this shit.  I love you.  I liked Ant's bit. 
[00:24:30]  We were going with the bit where the oceans are so fucking enormous that it's ridiculous  that that tide doesn't move the water a lot more.  A lot further.  So then our reference point was about 20 or 30 feet between low tide and high tide.  The water marks, not the depth.  And that's why Ant's bit worked.  It wouldn't work the other way.  No, it wouldn't have worked.  But Jimmy did say.  Oh, Jimmy said what?  No, I'm reading it right now.  The waves on the beach, you're correct.  They're caused by a contact with the bottom of the ocean. 
[00:25:00]  But you can't say that the fucking water doesn't move because of the moon.  It does.  We actually got a guy calling.  Hold on.  We got a guy actually calling from the ocean.  Hold on a minute.  Oh, wow.  Sean, go ahead.  He's on a wing.  Yeah, I'm Sean.  These two guys are cunts.  No, he's talking to the caller.  I'm six miles off the beach on a boat, and I have waves, and yes, they are affected by  the bottom of the ocean.  But it's wind, the exchange of heat that creates waves. 
[00:25:30]  All kinds of factors.  Yeah, I'm going with the guy that's on the ocean.  I think he knows more than textbook Jerry.  Unless he's only on the ocean because he doesn't know what he's doing in a boat and he can't  get back to shore.  Right.  Maybe he's stranded.  He's stranded out there.  I imagine he's actually a survivor from the plane crash.  He's just a call here.  Right.  Oh, my God.  It's just endless.  I love it.  But when you have conversations in your regular life, you're never talking over each other. 
[00:26:00]  It's astounding.  We give everyone a shot here.  Go ahead, Jerry.  The record for longest shipwreck is actually 44 days.  There was a guy named Louis Zamperi.  He was a World War II bombardier for a B-24 Liberator.  Got shot down off the coast of Japan.  He spent 44 days on a life raft in a book called Unbroken by Lauren Hildenbrand.  The guy's story is amazing. 
[00:26:30]  44 days this guy survived.  Is it a book?  It's a book.  It's called Unbroken.  It's a meme.  She wrote Seabiscuit as well.  Hold on.  Louis Zamperi.  How did he survive?  What did he drink?  He drank his own piss.  Yeah, but hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  I like breaking this shit apart.  We heard recently that you can only drink your piss of, what was it, for a couple days.  A couple of times, yeah.  A couple times or whatever, and then that doesn't work. 
[00:27:00]  It just becomes really pissy.  It's a fetish, yeah.  Unless you're replacing your pee with new water, and you're saying he, what, was able to?  Yeah, he was collecting it like in the raft that he was in.  Oh, right.  And then the raft, the raft started to, like, the paint that was painted, the raft started  to give off, like, this yellow dye.  Then he had to, like, fight off sharks.  He would actually, birds would land on his raft, and he would grab the birds and snap  their necks and eat them raw.  Oh, nice. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, he finally got caught by these Japanese guys in, like, some troller off of, what the  hell is that island, where the Death March started, the Bataan Death March.  This guy spent, like, another two years at a POW camp.  He was an Olympic medalist at the Berlin Games in, like, 1939.  He met Hitler, and then he went to fight the war.  It's a really amazing, I mean, it's been a true story.  The guy is, like, an American hero.  Shipwrecked it all, and then taken by the Japanese.  That stinks.  That really sucks.  It's like, oh, the odds have got to pick me up. 
[00:28:00]  Like, two weeks, I mean, two years at a POW camp.  They were injected with all these crazy, like, diseases to see what it would do to them.  And if you Google him, his name's Louis Vampiri.  He had the world record mile in the 1939 Olympics.  But what this guy went through, he survived.  Right.  And, you know.  Man, snapping a bird's neck and eating it raw.  That's rough.  That is rough.  You do that when you're starving, I guess.  Like, I can't picture being that hungry, but fucking.  Oh, you'll get there.  He'll eat anything. 
[00:28:30]  You'd get there.  Fucking human flesh.  Yeah.  That's even almost easier to understand than eating a bird raw.  I think the key is to take very small bites.  Very tiny.  Or do you take one giant bite and try to get it down?  You've got to really just kind of.  I think you've got to just nibble.  Just nibble away.  He said the shark.  Fighting the sharks was the hardest part because he figured as long as he stayed out of the water,  they would stay off the raft because they were trying to get him.  But why would he go on the water?  Well, you had to fish and stuff and to cool off. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, right.  He was with three other guys.  I mean, and they were baking alive.  They said his lips were so swollen from the sun that they touched the tip of his nose and  the bottom of his chin when they found him.  Wow.  He weighed like 60-something pounds.  He lost like almost 70% of his body weight in 44 days.  Two of the guys he was with died.  It's a crazy story.  Not to mention when he crashed, he got tangled up in all the wires in the B-24 and he got taken down with the boat or with the ship. 
[00:29:30]  It was insane.  I think 1,100 feet of water he came to and rose to the top.  You've got to read the book or even just go on Google and Google the guy's story.  Then he goes to Japan death camps and he meets this guy, the bird, who was like this sadistic Japanese POW camp director who just beat the shit out of him every day.  Why didn't they make a movie out of this guy?  I think he should.  I mean, they made Seabiscuit.  Right.  They should make a story about him. 
[00:30:00]  Did he eat anything off the guys that died?  No, he never went to cannibalism.  So he says.  He just couldn't bring himself to do it.  Right.  Not to mention the food, the stuff they were feeding him in Japan, it wasn't even like food.  They said it was like maggoty bread and they would give him a rice ball the size of like a golf ball and he would throw it at him.  And then you have to like pick out the rice from like the dirt.  And it was just what these guys went through.  What this guy went through was terrible.  Wow, I'm going to look this guy up. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, Louie, Louie's in here.  Look at, yeah.  Yeah, go on, I'm sorry.  No, go ahead, finish.  Sorry.  No, he's just, like I said, he was in 1939, he's shaking hands with Hitler.  And then in 1944, it's draft.  I'm going to take the good with the bad.  I can tell you what he's doing in 2014.  Hold on, there's someone always just waiting around the corner.  Go ahead, buzzard in Boston, go ahead.  Hey, ONA, this guy knows the story very well. 
[00:31:00]  But the fucking guy's name is Louie Zamperini.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I mispronounced his name.  What did you say?  Zamperi.  He was saying, yes, Zamperi.  Oh, no.  You know, the whole book.  The infighting.  It's just so petty.  It's like a bunch of fucking like flight attendants.  Why the fuck do we have the most petty listeners?  Petty.  I talked to other radio guys.  They don't have these petty listeners.  Oh, my goodness.  I think it was good.  I think it was good enough where if you were interested in what this guy was saying, you 
[00:31:30]  would be able to find it on Google.  Or he might call up and just go ahead.  I'd like to correct the guy on the name.  It's Zamperini.  In a nice way.  This fucking asshole.  I don't think you'd find him on Google.  You'd find some fucking French or Italian.  All right.  Fair enough.  Fair enough, Buzzard.  Thank you, sir.  All right, brother.  Of course you do.  Thank you.  Jerry, thank you, too.  See, we got off on the wrong foot.  And now you give us a nice little story. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, man.  It's like I said.  You should.  I don't know if you got anything about him.  Are you in love with the guy?  All right.  We got his name up there and stuff.  So it is Zamperini.  Z-A-M-P-E-R-I-N-I.  Zamperini.  Thank you, brother.  I have a Nick Cannon question.  Someone on Twitter said that it's coming out April 1st.  The guy said he's calling shenanigans.  Is that right?  What's the shenanigan?  Is it actually coming out or no?  April Fool's.  Have you heard music from it?  Yeah.  I mean, he's released singles from him. 
[00:32:30]  April 1st is just a Tuesday.  I don't know what the shenanigan would be.  He did dress in white face.  No, no, no.  Leading up to the fact that I'm putting this album,  now I'm dressed like this.  Then he doesn't really put it out.  Yeah, the whole thing was silly.  I wasn't.  April Files.  April Files.  If he's promoting, why would he not put out an album?  Just an April Fool's joke.  Not for any reason.  We got more info on Zamperini.  Zamboni.  Zamboni.  Hold on.  Let me go to Joe in Rhode Island. 
[00:33:00]  All right.  Joe, that guy knows everything about this story,  but he doesn't know this fact.  Go ahead, Joe.  Go ahead, Joe.  It's actually Joe from Rhode Island.  They're actually going to come up with a movie.  Christmas of this year, Angelina Jolie apparently was a neighbor or something,  and she's producing a movie.  It's coming out Christmas.  All right.  So the movie's being made.  Oh, yeah.  Some are saying the movie's already been made.  What?  I know she was doing some PR stuff on the Today Show, I think.  I saw an interview last month on that. 
[00:33:30]  She was talking about the same dude.  All right.  So this is going to be a movie.  That's cool.  Now we don't have to read the book.  Exactly.  I'd watch that.  Yeah, absolutely.  Thank you, sir.  Don in Indiana.  Hey, guys.  So the movie's coming out?  Yes, sir.  I-N-D-B it.  Right.  It's, I can't remember the name of the name of the damn movie.  Whatever the title of the book is, that's the name of the damn movie.  I can't remember the name of the book right now, but that's it.  All right.  It's definitely coming out, Angelina Jolie.  There's a big old preview about it.  It's very, very good. 
[00:34:00]  Unbroken?  Yeah, Unbroken.  Exactly.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  That's awesome.  I can't wait to see that.  I don't know.  Did he?  I don't know.  Did he die?  Is he still alive?  He's a World War II veteran.  Yeah, but they all dead or no?  There's a picture of him.  Oh, no, World War I vets.  I'm sorry.  There's a picture with him with Angelina Jolie.  He's 97 years old.  Oh, he's alive.  Okay, cool.  He lives in Olean, New York.  Olean, isn't that?  I think that's up near Buffalo, right?  No, it's not.  I don't know.  I'm going to say I don't know.  I was just totally guessing there. 
[00:34:30]  Olean, New York.  Is that where they make that fucking product?  Is it O-L-E-A-N?  O-L-E-A-N, yes.  Olean.  What's that product that they make that makes you shit?  They have a leaky asshole.  Ah.  Some seepage.  Oh, well.  Remember when I was just talking about pettiness, Ant?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Jim in Cleveland.  Jim.  Hey, Doug's got to get us facts straight.  There was no 1939.  I think it was either 38 or 36.  Okay, thank you.  All right, thanks.  Fucking asshole.  Thank you. 
[00:35:00]  What an asshole.  We would all fail if there was a test, okay?  Of course we would.  But hopefully we're entertaining you a little bit.  Isn't that what this is about?  I don't know how this became such serious.  Now we've got to be all about Google.  Yeah, yeah.  At every turn.  Google everything.  Wiki everything.  There's a guy who survived in the ocean eating fish.  I don't know how you do that.  I don't know how the fuck you catch fish if you're a life raft.  I have no idea.  How dumb are fish that they see your hand and they just swim up and let you cup them? 
[00:35:30]  I don't know how you do that.  How would you catch a fish?  What do you entice them with?  No, you don't have any of that stuff.  Oh.  How the fuck do you do it?  You make a hook out of what's left in the raft, but what do you entice them with?  You've got to cut a little piece of meat off yourself.  We're back to snapping your pinky off.  People are saying that should be an animation.  That's kind of funny.  I put the word out to Coke Logic, but that's up to him.  That was a good one.  I understand if he doesn't see it.  Kathy, go ahead. 
[00:36:00]  Hey, guys.  Love your show.  I'm a teacher.  Have fun with Mark Sanchez.  I'm a teacher in Jersey.  The Eagles might get Mark Sanchez.  And we have Vic.  Weird.  Oh, okay.  I get it.  Sorry.  Yeah, go ahead.  Sorry.  No, I used to show my students.  This is a show called Human Body Pushing the Limits from Discovery Channel, and the one  episode was Brain Power.  And they interviewed a guy who was stranded on the ocean. 
[00:36:30]  I don't know how he caught the fish.  I don't know if he did his pinky off or whatever.  But he was saying that he started to crave odd parts of the fish, like eyeballs, and even  like the thin little bones, because that was what nutrients of the body needed to survive.  So it was all about how your brain overpowers your other senses.  Right.  The old survival thing kicks in, and your body knows what it needs.  I just need to know how you catch a fish in the middle of the ocean when you're on just  a raft.  How do you do that? 
[00:37:00]  How do you make the hook?  Where's the line come from?  What happened?  Our ancestors would be able to tell us.  All right.  It wasn't about like, you know.  Thank you, Kath.  Yeah.  Thank you.  We have another correction we have to get to.  John in Pennsylvania.  John.  Guys.  Guys.  Yes.  Olean.  Olean New York.  Not Olean.  Olean.  Olean.  Olean.  I actually know that.  Now that you say it that way.  Olean.  Olean.  Just south of Geneseo. 
[00:37:30]  All right.  It is, right?  It's in that area somewhere?  South of it in Pennsylvania.  Oh, it's in Pennsylvania.  No, it's in New York.  Now I can correct you.  Wait a minute.  No, no.  I'm south in Pennsylvania.  Oh.  Olean is in New York.  But I don't care where you are.  I want to know where Olean is.  Olean south of Geneseo.  I'm never visiting you.  Who cares?  Yeah, really.  All right, John.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  What a chore this morning has been to start off here. 
[00:38:00]  It's like this every day.  All you have to do is go on Twitter once.  Yeah.  See the pettiness.  It's all around us.  Pettiness.  We're surrounded by pettiness.  We got our food.  Yes, we do.  So we'll go back to the Nick Cannon thing, Sam, after the break.  Okay.  I also heard Marion called the pre-show.  Yeah.  Yeah, she broke down.  All right, maybe you can tell us what that's all about after the break.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I also want to ask Jimmy if this bothers him. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah.  I'm getting shit on Twitter now about my tweet last night.  Oh, you tweet about this.  Don't say anything else.  We'll talk about that as well.  $50 worth of Jaeger shots.  Who hasn't done the Jaeger shots?  Oh, boy.  Okay, sets fire to bar and then punches old man in the face.  I don't even need to know the rest of the story.  That's all.  Jaeger Meister.  I remember how evil that was.  Fucking Jaeger.  It gave you a different buzz, I felt.  Was it all the sugar in that?  I don't know what the fuck it is, but that was my go-to bar nine shot. 
[00:39:00]  Right.  Back when we used to go to bar nine and fucking play music.  Sure.  And all the people would show up from the show and everything.  And I don't think I've ever been more fucked up than I was on Jaeger at bar nine once.  Joe Curry had to literally push me up the stairs from the bathroom that was downstairs.  Yeah.  Like, I couldn't even function.  Oh, it was terrible.  I was puking a black Jaeger Meister.  That looks scary.  What's in the Jaeger?  I don't know.  It seems to give you a bit of a different buzz. 
[00:39:30]  I don't know.  Yeah.  Is that possible?  Or are you just more buzzed because of the alcohol content?  I don't know.  Or is it mixing the sugars and everything else that's in there?  Anyone?  I don't know.  I don't know the...  I'm not even going to hazard a guess because I don't want to get chewed apart on the phone.  No, it's not that asshole.  It's got deer blood in it.  Did you actually say it's because of the sugars?  What an idiot.  I don't know. 
[00:40:00]  No problem saying I don't know.  Some of the stuff I think about in my head, I just throw out there.  I don't know.  Just toss it out.  Maybe I'll learn something today.  Right.  Maybe not.  Whatever.  That's the guy, huh?  God, we've all seen that guy a million times.  He looks like a problem.  Well, yeah.  Why did he do all this?  Jaeger.  Let's see.  Sports Bar Friday.  Drank 10 shots.  He then lit a fire in a bathroom. 
[00:40:30]  She's at the sports bar.  It's Friday.  Thank you.  He then lit a fire in the bathroom and tried to leave without paying.  He also punched two customers in the face who tried to stop him.  What a jerk-off.  This guy rules.  He is a jerk-off, but something funny about that.  Yeah, girl, do you?  Whenever a guy does that many things wrong in a row, that's what's funny.  Right.  Yeah.  It's like, wouldn't one of those things be bad enough?  Yeah.  Oh, yes.  Oh, wait.  What?  It says the police believe that he set the fire to create a diversion so he could leave without 
[00:41:00]  paying for his drinks.  That's smart.  There you go.  All right.  At least he's thinking.  The diversion.  At least he's thinking.  Wow.  We had some base jumping.  Was that overnight or is that an older story?  And the video finally was released.  That has to be older because they busted that kid list last week.  The security there is probably tight.  It was last year.  It was, right?  Yeah.  Because I think it was in the paper with the new one with the kid.  A six-year-old kid got all the way to the top and was climbing on the antenna of the  new, what is it called? 
[00:41:30]  The Freedom Tower?  The Freedom Tower.  One World Trade.  But he got through all sorts of security.  No security.  And one guy was sleeping.  And I was like, I would love to see a picture of this guy because I've seen it.  I've seen the sleepy security guards.  Oh, boy.  Maybe someone gave him a chair to sit on.  Oh, boy.  You give him a chair.  They sit down.  They fall asleep.  Right.  You can rob shit right around him.  Well, that kid got through everybody.  Yeah.  He had a hard hat on and everything.  He had a hard hat.  Got all the way to the top and then supposedly he was climbing around the antenna, I think. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  And then they finally got him a couple hours later, I guess.  That face jump is...  I didn't know it was at night.  Holy fuck.  That's creepy.  During the day it was scary more, though.  Yeah?  I think so because you could see how far you are either way, but you have so much more detail  to see on the way down.  Right.  Where's the video?  Are we putting it up on our stuff?  That's cool as fuck, man.  Yeah, we'll have it up on O&A Show on Twitter.  Okay.  They are way the fuck up there. 
[00:42:30]  That's a ballsy thing to do.  They just jump off of that building at night.  They're walking.  That's horrifying.  You just think of those poor fucking people that had to jump.  That's exactly what you think.  And that's what you're thinking.  Right.  They had to.  That's what they saw.  With no fucking parachute.  No chance.  Ugh.  Petrifying.  Oh, man, you're right at the edge there.  Oh.  Yeah, look at that.  They're just looking over the city at night.  You can kind of see the curvature, which might be the camera.  Yeah, the camera is the camera. 
[00:43:00]  But, I mean, it's just fucking high up.  Sure.  That's crazy high up.  Yeah, let's see the Hudson.  Are they up on the antenna part?  What's that red light?  Oh, is it the camera?  Yeah.  Oh, that's one of the guys.  Okay.  That was the...  Yeah, it's a bit dark.  Peaceful up there.  Are they just thinking it over?  Yeah, making sure the shoot's good.  I guess they're getting their...  If you have a base jump video, you can't be two minutes in without any jumping.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[00:43:30]  Pay off, though.  You're probably just enjoying that view for a minute.  All right, enjoy that before you hit record.  You got this.  Enjoy it for yourself.  Right.  He says, you got this.  I think he's just trying to get the nerves up.  He's got the camera on his head.  Video half over.  He still hasn't jumped.  No.  He's breathing heavy.  He really is.  He's thinking it over.  Why is he nervous if that's what they do?  I don't know.  I bet it's the adrenaline.  He's just...  Because you're flying not that far away from the building. 
[00:44:00]  Flying.  Flying.  Falling.  Thank God I correct myself on that.  There he goes.  He jumps.  Wow.  Wow.  I understand, too.  The risk is that you're going to fall and the parachute's going to smash you right into  the side of another building.  Exactly.  Or another building or an antenna.  Sure.  Yes.  Yes.  Where did they land?  Now we're watching from that point of view.  But it doesn't look nearly this scary going down.  Yeah, right.  It doesn't.  No, it doesn't. 
[00:44:30]  Not at night.  It doesn't.  That building's coming up fast on the right.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  That rolls.  Holy shit.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  I want to see how he lands.  Does he land near a cab?  Yeah, on the fucking West Side Highway?  That would suck.  Well, they could steer those things pretty good, though.  Yeah.  So where is he going to land?  He's coming down for landing in the...  He's coming down...  What road is that?  He's going pretty far.  I think...  Is that the West Side Highway?  Yeah.  Yeah, you're right.  Middle of the night, obviously, because there's barely any cars on there.  You don't realize what kind of good time you're making doing that. 
[00:45:00]  Really?  Good time.  Where's he going to land?  Right on the West Side Highway.  Yeah, he's going West Side Highway.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  He's coming in pretty quick.  Wow, underneath the traffic light.  Really?  Whoa, that's fucking amazing.  And then he's running.  He dragged the parachute.  Some cars are going by.  Like, what the fuck was that?  Right.  He's getting to the other side of the West Side Highway.  I wonder if he's going to jump in. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, yes.  Oh, yeah.  That would be hilarious if he landed right in front of a cop.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  He's running.  Good for these guys.  Well, they got caught.  I love adventurers.  And they're in a lot of trouble, apparently.  Are they?  Yeah.  What's he doing?  He's probably holding up that chute.  Holding up his chute.  This shit is so out of control, they're going to have to make some crazy law, unfortunately,  right?  Because right now, it's a slap on the wrist.  It's like trespassing, but I think there's also some kind of endangering human charge. 
[00:46:00]  Human lives.  But this guy's putting it in his little bag.  He found some bushes to hide behind.  Yeah.  Well, he puts it in a little duffel bag, and then what?  He just walks around with his parachute.  Yeah.  You never know.  It takes a minute to fold it up, but I guess you can't just walk through New York with a parachute.  Yeah, dragging a parachute with you.  How did he get caught?  Oh, he's by close.  So it took him by about 40 seconds to fold it up.  Did he have a helmet?  It's a helmet cam, yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:46:30]  And he has a mask on.  Wow, that was fucking cool.  Why doesn't he say anything?  I don't know.  He was panicking at that point.  Yeah.  There was something I saw.  That was great.  What did I see of the guy hanging from the high?  They show that a jump off the...  Do we give a watch to one in fucking...  Where is it?  Just going to leave you.  Yeah, I don't know.  No, no, no.  I have no idea. 
[00:47:00]  You haven't given us anything yet.  No, no, no.  I'm trying to help you.  It'll come to you.  No, the tower.  The Burj Tower.  Oh, yes.  When they base jumped off that.  They allowed...  The building allowed it, though, but they had them out on a crane.  Whoa.  Hanging.  So they were far enough away from the building.  From the building, but it's a lot higher.  That's double the height.  This guy just jumped.  I've never seen that.  Yeah.  You see the new video?  I think it's those Russian kids.  We've played a lot of their videos.  Yeah.  Did you see the new one with the skateboard?  No.  No way.  No way with a skateboard. 
[00:47:30]  I mean, what did he do?  Well, a little skateboarding near the edge of a building.  Why would you do that?  And then they're like walking across like a...  They look like handrails, but they left the snow on them just for extra fucking creep  factor and danger.  And I know what I was just thinking of, too, besides that jump, was when those old walls  of people walk on, that walkway that was built for a king, like in Spain, it's only like  350 feet in the air or 330, but it's really...  Go to like the crumbling wall in Spain that people... 
[00:48:00]  Daredevils go to it now.  It goes around the side of a cliff almost.  Oh, man.  And it's falling apart.  It's like, you know...  Oh, I know what you're talking about.  Why would you do that?  It's a walkway right up against the mountain.  Yes.  Yeah.  And it's only like...  Three feet wide.  Tops.  Yeah.  But I mean, it's missing like a whole...  I saw that video.  Yeah.  That was really fucking frightening.  Yeah.  I'm trying to think where that video was.  I'll take it.  No.  You would know it when you see it.  Not China's Great Wall. 
[00:48:30]  No, no, no, no.  Of course not.  What did you put in there?  Spain, crumbling wall, walkway.  Try walkway, too.  Oh.  Is it in Spain?  I believe so.  Maybe take out Spain.  I could be wrong.  Oh, fuck.  What...  Man, I saw that video.  God damn the thought of me.  I don't know.  Well, we didn't know we were going to talk about this today.  No, I know, but I...  If someone knows what we're talking about, send us a link, please.  Is it in China?  I don't think so.  In China?  No.  I think it's...  Maybe, though.  It's like a glass walkway around a mountain?  Oh, no, no.  It's not glass. 
[00:49:00]  Okay, sorry.  Do they have a glass walkway?  Yeah, I'm looking at a story.  You can lay under it for a certain amount of money.  Fucking...  There's a glass walkway on the side of a mountain in China.  Let me take this one while we figure shit out.  Let's get in and out.  Yeah, right?  Birdman!  What's up?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, listen.  The Jagamice is made with artichoke extract.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  And that's what gets you fucked up?  I'm a professional.  But that's what gets you fucked up?  Yeah, it's the fuck.  It's like, you know...  Anthony, you would know what this is.  You know, aperitivo, like the Amado and stuff that serve at the Italian restaurant? 
[00:49:30]  I don't know why I know that.  Because you're Italian.  You're a racist, sir.  I don't think you're a drunken like me.  No, it's Italian liqueur.  It's called Amado or something like that.  I don't drink any of that fucking shit.  Yeah, liqueur.  Yeah.  Come.  Come.  Galeano.  Yeah.  90 drinks.  Do you enjoy a good port?  No.  Is a port that really heavy, syrupy, whiny crap?  Yeah.  One of our old bosses would take us out to Patsy's over there on 56, and he would sit there and enjoy a port at the end of his meal. 
[00:50:00]  I like a good campy.  I tried it.  It was brutal.  What is it, dude?  Bottom of the barrel crap or something?  No, no.  Let's sit there for a while.  It's probably mixed with loads.  Somebody's fucking...  Jeez, dude.  Birdman.  All right.  Goodbye.  Birdman never disappoints.  What was the Seinfeld reference?  I found it.  Oh.  What was the Seinfeld reference?  The chair.  The guard falling asleep in the chair.  Oh, but that seems pretty... 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  I wasn't trying to fool anyone.  I was just doing one.  Yeah.  El Camino de...  Or just Google old walkway around Cliff.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah, this thing...  It's falling...  It's really...  When you do this, did you find it?  No, no, no.  No, it's way on the top of the side of a mountain.  I think that's it right there.  Peace.  Yeah.  It's one of those things where...  On the radio it won't play, but you should just look this up.  And I guess we built 100 years ago for the king to walk around.  Well, we put all this up on our Facebook page, so... 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  Go to O&A Show on Facebook.  We'll have this up.  Wow, that's crazy.  Yeah, but it's a really cool thing.  I would love to do that if it was actually built fucking 10 years ago.  I don't like this dumb music either.  It's like fucking, you know...  It's very Euro trashy.  Yeah, it really is.  Tick it, tick it, tick it, tick it, tick it.  Yeah, this is like...  See, it starts off easy.  Look.  Oh, a little cement.  I was actually watching.  I could do this part.  I could do this part.  Oh, I could do this.  Oh, all right.  The steps are a little old, but I could do it.  Yeah, crumbling.  No problem.  I thought how much it would suck to be stuck in the... 
[00:51:30]  You could turn the...  Man, that music is really bad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's in terrible shape.  Steps are in the...  Oh, I could still do this.  Look.  There's a little straight in.  There's a wire to hold on to, by the way, on the wall, so you can't hold on to a little wire.  Or connect something if you...  Oh, a couple holes that go straight down and nothing, but you could walk...  Okay, no.  Now I'm not going.  I'm out already.  I'm out already.  There's no fucking way.  You're on the side of a cliff and then there's like a...  There's like a four or five foot gap.  That could just crack.  You have to jump.  You have to jump across that. 
[00:52:00]  Look at these walking on the outside there.  How come in other countries they allow people to do this?  Well, here's what I heard the rules are with this thing.  You have to be 12 years old and up and not afraid of heights.  That's the rules.  That's it.  They don't overly regulate it.  You could connect to that wire, though.  How many people fall off and die?  I don't know.  I didn't see anything about that.  I think a couple of...  All right, now we're back to...  Yeah, I can do that.  That's easy.  I can do this whole next part.  I can do this.  Oh, walk up these stairs.  No problem.  It's like a video game.  Yeah.  Right.  You got to jump and wall run. 
[00:52:30]  All right, now we got another sharp...  I can do this.  This is easy.  How are they trusting any of this?  Yeah.  I'm so afraid of heights.  I'd push this guy out of the way.  Oh, my God.  He goes around him.  He just goes around him.  Wow.  This is stupid.  Yeah, I would just kind of...  All right, I can do this.  You go up the stairs.  Nice.  If I was the king, I would have killed everyone that made this.  You want me to walk on this?  Look out of here.  That's a 12-foot gap.  He's walking on...  He's walking on the pole.  On the pole. 
[00:53:00]  And by the way, it was...  It looks so cracked.  There was a handrail that went around it.  There was...  Not this is modern.  But there was an old handrail that went around for the king to hold on to.  It's pretty nice.  King.  Dummy.  I would be losing my mind.  Yeah, you're way up there.  Yeah, no way.  But it looks fun to do if it was in good shape.  How cool is that?  Oh, my God.  I don't know if it's fun.  I think you'd do it to say, yeah, I did it.  No, no, if it was new, though.  I mean, if it was brand new.  Right.  That just looks like it would crack under you and you'd fall down and perish.  Someone must die doing this. 
[00:53:30]  I would love to know how many people die.  There have been several.  There have been several.  They closed it in 2000 after two people died within two years.  Yeah, there you go.  2000?  Yeah.  So how old is this video that we're watching?  I don't know.  It's a GoPro-type video.  I don't know.  They're probably doing it illegally now.  They're not going to have a guy just making sure you don't do it.  Look at how fast these guys are walking.  These guys are crazy.  Like the one guy, you're watching a guy walk right now, and he's strapped in on a wire.  He's got the safety line, yeah.  Yeah, and this guy just walked around and doing 40 miles an hour.  This guy walks quick. 
[00:54:00]  Well, if you're attached to the safety line, it's not as bad.  Oh, dude, I would still be paralyzed.  You would still be scared.  Yeah, of course.  Oh, there's so many gaps.  And the gaps, there's an outside.  What would you say?  How would you describe that?  A pipe.  An outside pipe, which would be the edge of the concrete, but the concrete's gone,  so it's just the outside pipe you have to walk along for like 10 feet at a time sometimes.  Why did they make this?  Just probably the king wanted to just take a stroll around or whatever.  A stroll?  Maybe it was just something to do. 
[00:54:30]  It's just like, it's probably a shortcut.  And they didn't have the safety wires or whatever, so.  Oh, there's a hole that just drops down enough in this.  What's keeping the rest from just busting and crumbling under them?  I don't know.  Nothing.  Probably a shortcut.  I'm thinking it's a fucking tour.  You think you could jump up and down real hard on that?  Oh, hell yeah.  In certain parts, you'd probably be okay.  It depends on who you are.  If you were a certain guy that works for our show, I'd say no.  Do you want to know why they made it?  Why?  Because in 1901, it became apparent that workers at the hydroelectric power plants in Churro Falls and some other falls needed a means to cross between the falls to provide for transport of materials and inspection and maintenance of the channel. 
[00:55:00]  So they built this.  So they were actually using this as a work thing.  Look at this.  There's nothing.  There's nothing.  There's nothing there.  It's just the metal structure underneath, but all the...  I would just crawl on my stomach.  No way.  Oh, this is being used for the...  There's one part where they walk over, and it's like a giant hydroelectric... 
[00:55:30]  One of those giant cylinders.  Wait, so you're walking shit over with this?  Yeah, apparently.  You're goods?  You're like...  What, you got a little hand truck?  They had a fucking handrail on the outside, too, though.  So this was probably very safe.  I don't see any rebar in that cement, either.  Oh, man.  No, there's just big chunks of the cement.  Yeah, reinforcement, so it just holds it together.  It's just crumbly.  It was probably safe 100 years ago when it was brand new.  But how is it attached to the mountain?  It's probably got some good guinea cement workers working on this shit. 
[00:56:00]  You could see a part where there's, like, giant pipes going through the side of them.  Yeah, you could see it.  Some part was really good.  Imagine...  Imagine it was your job to build this?  Right here, look at this.  They can't.  It's radio, but that's an amazing gap.  Yeah, sorry, guys.  You're looking at 8 to 10 feet of nothingness, and he's got to walk on the pipe.  Walking in a tiny little eye-beam thing.  It's like a train track.  This guy has good balance.  I would never do that.  No.  And in high school, I was voted, boy, least likely to lose his balance.  Oh, wow.  Metaphorically.  Metaphorically.  Is this video almost done? 
[00:56:30]  We get the point.  It was just, you could see the old workings.  We decided to tap out with 15 seconds left.  God, we really do suck.  Oh, there's a little gate.  A little watered gate.  And then it just ends.  Oh.  Oh, no, you can get jumped out, I guess.  Oh, you get down from there.  Fuck that.  I don't know.  That's a silly little walkway.  Let's say hi to Snowy in Michigan.  I've done that.  Snowy.  Hey, guys.  How you doing, man?  Hey, buddy.  Travis mentioned that glass walkway in China. 
[00:57:00]  There's some other place in China.  It's like some temple that's this path going to it.  It's over these steps and, like, it's up, I mean, around this cliff face.  And it's just these people hike this thing.  It's some sort of temple.  I'm sorry, I don't know the exact name of it, but I was looking for, like, these high places.  And besides that glass, you know, thing, it is some sort of temple.  The path going to it is all these, like, shears and something.  Temple, some kind of temple.  It was a temple.  It seems like it's similar to what Jimmy just showed us.  We'll look it up.  All right. 
[00:57:30]  Thanks, guys.  Thanks, Snowy.  And then we have to say hi to TJ in New York.  TJ.  Hey, guys.  Hi.  Have you guys ever seen the Stairway to Heaven in Hawaii?  What the hell is that?  It's Old Naval Outlook.  You can see the entire outline of the island once you climb up there.  They shut it down years back.  But me and my buddies climbed up there.  You just got to do it before daylight.  And then you can beat the guard.  Like, beat them?  Oh, so you're not supposed to be doing this.  It's called Stairway to Heaven. 
[00:58:00]  The Haiku Stairs?  Does that sound familiar?  The Stairway to Heaven, Hawaii.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Why do they build these things?  Well, it's just steps walking up the side of a mountain.  That's pretty steep.  That's pretty fucking steep, Jimmy.  That's almost like a ladder.  I bet you get tired.  It's almost like a ladder.  You got three stations where you can stop off at.  But the rest is just like a ladder.  That feels much safer, though. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  It's safer than what Jimmy showed us.  But look how steep that shit is.  That doesn't bother me.  I would go down that.  I mean, I would hold on.  Yeah, yeah.  But I would fucking...  I'd do a pogo stick up and down that steps.  It goes all over the top of the...  What do you mean you got to get past the guards?  They just don't let you do this anymore?  Yeah, they have a guard standing at the bottom.  But if you go before daylight and you make it up like the first order of it, he's not going to chase you up.  But why was it built?  Do you know?  It was built as an outlet base.  So they had a good idea at the time. 
[00:59:00]  And then they decide, fuck this.  We got to make sure people don't do it anymore.  They got helicopters.  Wow.  And it goes right to the top.  And he's right.  You see the entire island.  I hate this music.  Where are they?  Hawaii?  Yeah.  More trash.  Lots of music.  Why are we listening to this music?  It's terrible.  We can do it this way, too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It makes me want to go over there and just fucking dance.  Give the people something to listen to while we watch a video.  I don't think they're enjoying that music.  Thank you, TJ.  We'll put that up on our Facebook page as well. 
[00:59:30]  O-N-Day show on Facebook.  Like us, please.  Yeah, see, we give you the video to watch later on.  You all got goddamn phones or computers.  Stop it.  Well, you know, if we were doing the Joe Rogan way,  they would be watching right along with us.  Right with us.  But for some reason, the company still doesn't get that part of it.  How cool would that be?  Here's our video feed.  This is the shit we're watching right now.  Check it out as we check it out.  Makes sense to me.  It's a multimedia world at this point. 
[01:00:00]  It's just a fad.  It's not a radio world anymore.  It's a multimedia world.  It certainly is.  It certainly is.  So where were we before we got side?  We were talking about the hunter?  All right.  I'm with Jimmy with this stuff.  I mean, this is brutal shit.  And people still...  I'm not against hunters.  I'm not against hunting.  I'm against this type.  There's piggish trophy hunting.  Trophy hunting.  Woman shoots giraffe, poses triumphantly with corpse.  In her pajamas?  How it got in her pajamas, I'll never know. 
[01:00:30]  No, it's a Toys R Us.  Well, you gotta...  Shut the sign.  According to Animal Shame, an organization that collects and posts these trophy pictures on Facebook,  the giraffe was eating from a tree at the time of slaughter, just minding its own business.  The photo was originally posted on the Facebook page by...  Oof.  Koshal's World Hunting Adventures?  I think I said that right.  A full-service taxidermy shop in Wisconsin. 
[01:01:00]  The site has since taken down the image.  They're called canned hunts, often hosted on South African reserves, where visitors pay  a mint to bag something exotic.  If you could call animals that were raised by humans specifically for the hunt, exotic.  And if a rifle isn't enough of an advantage, the animals are also frequently drugged to ensure  maximum killability.  Is that true?  I don't know.  That sounds like it could be some kind of propaganda thing, but... 
[01:01:30]  From the other side?  I don't even think they should be, yeah.  I've heard that they slow down the animals a little bit.  I don't know.  If they're slowing them down, that's retarded.  Because, you know, you want to kill your exotic animal in due time.  You don't want to be out there all day.  You don't want to get that out there all day is right.  You've got other things to do and see in Africa.  Jeez.  So they make the hunt relatively easy for you.  Yeah, it's ridiculous.  Jimmy hates animals.  We all know that from the fine podcast that's doing extremely well.  Can't stand animals.  Can we check our numbers, Sam? 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, let's check out those numbers.  Let's check out our numbers, Sam.  People on Twitter are just such babies about that.  It's like, you know, I'm talking about trophy hunters and this kind of a hunt, and they  still pipe up.  But it helps.  They give the money to...  Oh, fucking just shut up.  It's the end justifies the means.  Is that what they're saying?  If you do that, you're a dick.  Just accept it.  I'm a dick, and that's what I do.  You say that.  Yeah.  A lot of these, they have them fenced in, so they can't even go anywhere.  So you're not even having a real hunt anymore.  Yeah, it's like, oh, good.  He hit the fence.  I could shoot him now. 
[01:02:30]  Right now, he's cornered.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm not into that.  I mean, I don't know.  I don't even know how you go, like, hunting big game anymore.  I don't think you can.  I think that was a thing of the past.  Right.  Where you legitimately went out with a fucking, that elephant gun.  Ah, bully, bully!  Put on that weird fucking safari hat and went out and shot something giant that you didn't  know if it was going to come bursting out of the woods at you.  I think the goal of the human is to kill everything.  To kill everything. 
[01:03:00]  Everything.  On the planet.  I think that's our goal.  Whether it's direct or through some kind of fucking environmental disaster.  We're just shit.  We are just bacteria.  I love it.  I don't know.  Fuck it.  I kind of like seeing other things out there.  If we were gone, though, this planet would be just dandy.  Oh, sure.  We're not going to kill the planet.  We'd be dead and this fucking, within a few years, no one would ever know what we're even  here.  There would be new assholes.  Right. 
[01:03:30]  Not saying that.  Brand new shitheads.  Not saying the next thing that comes along isn't going to be a bunch of assholes either.  This would be a green, lush, amazing planet without people.  And then something would come to here and go, wow.  Right.  Who's not using this thing?  Look.  Right.  It's amazing.  Oh, Jimmy.  Look at your podcast number.  Oh.  I don't even notice that word.  I don't even care.  Oh, the Bell Knocks Lady Di podcast doing extremely well.  The Snooping Kids is our fan favorite.  That one people really, really enjoy. 
[01:04:00]  Scarlett Johansson.  Scarlett Johansson.  The day we discovered naked pictures of Scarlett Johansson is doing well.  She's lovely.  And then we did a Scott and Todd podcast recently.  The best of us beating the shit out of those guys.  How's that doing?  They're all doing extremely well, Sam.  You see.  And then the Patrice O'Neill Memorial podcast doing well.  Those are the last five podcasts.  So go get our podcast, the Open Anthony podcast.  This week, I believe, which will be out tomorrow, is the best of 2004, right? 
[01:04:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, wow.  The first year on satellite radio.  Oh, yes.  You can't even really call it the best of because it's only a quick hour, hour and a half.  There was only October 4th until the end of the year.  Oh.  That was 2004.  Yeah.  Three months.  We're going to do that.  So we'll do the best of 2004.  Down the road, we'll do 2005 and on and on.  Indeed.  Look at that fucking 10 years ago.  That's ridiculous.  Crazy.  I can't believe it's that long.  10 years of just stuck in the mud.  I remember you getting off the train.  You were coming back. 
[01:05:00]  You and Anne had gone to DC.  Right.  And I met you at the train at the garden or whatever it was when you got off.  And I was still living at my old place.  And you were like, yeah, man, we're going to go to mornings.  Yeah, we made love.  I had the sailor outfit on and you dressed like the girl.  We did the famous picture.  But no, you're like, yeah, we're going to mornings, man.  I'm like, fuck.  I was so bummed out at that time.  I didn't want to go to mornings.  I was like, we should stay in the afternoon.  Yeah, I was thinking that, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was like, how am I doing radio without beer? 
[01:05:30]  And now you guys want to stay in mornings and I don't want to go to afternoons.  It's not even want to stay in mornings.  I hate getting up, dude.  I hate it.  I just think it's better for us.  But I hate the waking up.  Who knows?  I don't enjoy it.  Who the fuck knows?  Let's say hi to John in Michigan.  Hi, John.  Hey, boys.  What's up, John?  Yeah, I just wanted to say, I think hunters that say they do it for the meat, I don't think  they're actually, they're just using that as an excuse because  once they take the meat, they still put the head or the antlers up on their walls. 
[01:06:00]  Well, yeah.  There's a lot of guys that are into the, you know, the trophy and all that.  I get it.  But there's also, you know, we're trying to figure out how many of a particular animal  we have to, you know, kill.  People enjoy hunting and, you know, if they get, if they're getting meat out of it, it  doesn't mean they're not enjoying hunting also.  That's, you know.  I'm not for shutting down hunting, trust me.  But this over-the-top trophy hunting, that's, everyone has their line with everything. 
[01:06:30]  That's mine.  I think it's fucking gluttonous and disgusting.  Yeah, I do too.  It's, it's, it's, it's good words to put it.  Disgusting and gluttonous.  Thank you, John.  I agree.  All right.  Thanks.  But then people will go, well, that, well, they, they put money into the, oh, fuck you  and fuck them.  They're just putting money in.  So really, so if I donate money to women's causes, it's okay if I fucking sexually assault?  Because, you know, in the end, I put money in.  So I guess I can grab a few tits.  Bring up a good point, Jim.  Maybe that's, uh, maybe we're going to have to sacrifice one every once in a while. 
[01:07:00]  Let's say hi to, uh, Dr. J, Dr. J, God.  What's up, buddy?  How are you?  Oh, you're not that, Dr. J.  Boo.  How do you go through life being a fraud?  Hey, let's update on this hunting bullshit.  It used to be years ago, you had to have a lot of money, fly to Africa, and kill a big  game animal.  I live in the Ocala area, and north of me, there are a couple of towns like Brantford, and 
[01:07:30]  they've got hunting preserves there.  They breed these animals in Florida.  I believe they do it in Texas as well.  You give the guy five to ten grand, and they walk you through the 10,000-acre preserve, and  they make it seem like you're on a real hunt.  I think there's an antelope up ahead.  Well, the antelope is always in the same place.  They let him out of the fucking cage in the morning.  So you pay five or ten grand, you're in Florida, and you go out there, and you shoot an antelope  in the lungs, and that's like sport.  But figure that out.  It makes no sense. 
[01:08:00]  If you want to hunt, go out in the woods with a fucking buck knife, and if you could jump  on a deer and kill it, great.  But I don't understand.  You're in a tree stand having a hot cup of coffee.  You've scattered corn throughout the year to bring the deer in.  The deer is eating the corn, and you shoot him in the freaking lungs.  Where's the sport?  It's really annoying, and the bottom line is, if hunters just said, like, yeah, I like  a rigged game, then just say that, but they still have to defend it, like they're doing  this masculine, amazing, it's nature, so shitting outdoors. 
[01:08:30]  Thank you, Jimmy.  It gets even worse.  Where I live, I live west of Ocala, in a little hick town, and there's a lot of hunters out  here, and they know how I feel, and they're not real thrilled with it, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you know, you've heard of PETA, people for the ethical treatment, around here, and  this is true, they wear shirts that say PETA, people eating tasty animals.  Oh, boy, you people over there. 
[01:09:00]  I don't mind that as much, because PETA, look, even though I agree with some of what PETA does,  they've made themselves hateable at times, too, because they're unreasonable, and they're  extremely self-righteous about everything, and they wind up, you know, killing some of  the animals, you know?  I think they do good shit, but they're so hardcore, they're irritating.  And most of the people definitely kill and take the antlers, by the way, because you're  in the middle of nowhere, and you take one of these deer down, and you don't know how  much of a pain in the ass it is to drag that thing out? 
[01:09:30]  So a lot of these guys are like, well, fuck that.  I just need the antlers.  I saw the antlers off his head, and head back home.  I'd be done with it.  You know, and gutting the thing is no fun either, but I talk to these locals where I live,  and I'm from New York originally.  You can tell by my Georgia accent.  Damn, you're funny.  You can talk to these people, and they bring their kids out there, it's bonding, and they're  getting in touch with nature.  Give me a fucking break.  Yeah.  It's an annoying excuse.  I've got to get into the office.  All right.  All right.  Office. 
[01:10:00]  You have to hold him up.  Goodbye, sir.  Just got the box set.  He's going to watch it.  Got to get into the office.  He froze on a funny face Carell was making, and he couldn't wait any longer to get back.  Tim in Arizona.  I wish.  You know, when I worked in the northwest part of Colorado, one of the neighbors of the  ranch that I worked on, this guy would put a 12-foot-high fence around his property,  and he baited all the deer and the elk to go in there, and he would pay, or people from 
[01:10:30]  Chicago.  Was he a master at that?  Oh, yeah.  He was real notorious for this, and all the other ranchers.  I know.  I got it.  That's okay.  Go ahead.  His main clientele was from Chicago, and these guys were not hunters.  They just came out, and this was in the early 80s.  They would pay him $2,500, $3,000.  He'd put them up in a cabin and give them a map and say, okay, here's where they're at. 
[01:11:00]  And all it ended up doing is they would take the head, have it mounted, and they'd leave  the meat for the rest of the people around the area.  Now, I'm a hunter.  I do it.  And all I do, all I eat, I get the meat, I take it home, I eat it.  It's in my freezer.  I cook it.  I eat it.  So on and so forth.  Yeah.  I mean, but, you know, these guys-  I love us.  Not your call, sir.  We tapped out on you a while ago.  Those are crazy, right? 
[01:11:30]  We're looking at the skirts walking by.  What happened?  Yeah.  The girl's fucking mad.  It's crazy.  It's the guy's mouth cute.  It's really amazing.  No, Tim, I understand.  It's Jimmy.  I understand your point.  We're just talking about tits.  He's trying to make his fucking business on the phone.  Look, we don't have to be here.  If you're talking and it's going out, people are listening.  Why do we have to listen?  Other people.  Exactly.  Other people are listening.  Thanks, Tim.  You keep going.  I'm just fucking with you.  Thank you.  We'll have our own discussion here amongst ourselves.  We can multitask.  Yeah.  You take care of the radio show, babble, and whatever you're babbling about, and we're 
[01:12:00]  looking at some wonderful-  Turn around and stare.  Oh, you did it, right?  Oh, she has big, heavy bosoms.  I want to be nurtured by those.  She went tight, tight shirt today, too.  I would make baby noises while sucking her bosom.  Wait, do you?  She could hold my head.  I would hold her titties with both hands, like, on each breath.  All right, now you've got to be quiet.  Why?  Because they're walking past where it plays. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, sorry.  Too bad the girl doesn't work here for two years anymore.  There.  Not you, stupid.  That's the problem when they walk down the long hall.  Yeah, yeah.  There's a delay, so they hear exactly what we're saying.  I don't think there's a delay in the office.  All right, good.  Oh, yes, I think we're okay.  All right, good.  Let me take one more phone call on this hunting thing.  Andy in Georgia.  I never noticed.  Oh, sorry.  Wrong Andy.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hi.  I just wanted to point out just one difference.  There is a lot of guys that go hunting, and they'll kill, like, moose and elk and do actually eat the meat. 
[01:13:00]  But to me, the people that go to South Africa or preserves and kill lions, for example, are just doing it just to show off their rich.  It's just a way to show people, hey, I've got plenty of money.  I can drop 20 grand on a hunt.  It's just a way to brag.  I think it's brutal.  I mean, if they're not eating the meatus.  But there's another thing in there that it's just this weird need to kill something that is rare or, I don't know. 
[01:13:30]  I'm not against hunters.  I just want to make sure people know that.  Yeah, because I eat meat.  It's over-the-top shit that...  People that eat the meat.  Right.  That killing, you know, a moose or an elk or caribou.  Yeah, they may melt the animal to wall.  Machine gun them.  Me, first, if someone goes and kills a fucking giraffe, I mean, that's for no reason other than just to show, hey, I'm rich.  I can drop 20 grand to go kill a fucking giraffe. 
[01:14:00]  Right.  That's all it is.  Thank you, sir.  Exactly.  How much does she throw a rock at its head?  I'd pay $100 to do that, just to throw a rock at the giraffe and taunt it.  Just get so mad it looks at you.  Yeah.  So mad.  How much do you take a microphone out there and just fire out long-neck insults?  I'll give $200 to stand there with a mic and just humiliate it verbally.  What?  I don't even know if this is possible.  But why can't they do those exotic hunts and just, like, tranquilizers, get them sleepy, take your pictures, and then move on? 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Is that even a possibility?  I don't even know.  Just tranquilize.  Yeah, I think an animal being tranquilized 50 times might be a little stressful on his system.  Start looking like Lindsay Lohan.  I say you tranquilize the hunter.  That'd be kind of cool.  Yeah.  Tranquilize the hunter, and then he's all fucked up and has a little harder of a time.  And then you put a few of them out there at once.  Right.  And they'll probably be shooting each other.  That could be a treat.  Yeah, that's a little sport.  John in Jersey.  John. 
[01:15:00]  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  You know, I'm curious.  How come if you, you know, you strangle an animal with your bare hands, you're a psychopath, but you shoot it with a rifle.  You know, it's a sport.  You know, everybody, especially with the Jets signing Vic, you know, they're giving them, you know, a lot of shit about dogfighting.  Now, how is that different than, you know, shooting birds out of the air?  Well, a lot of people were offended by what Michael Vick did, but didn't he pay back society at this point?  You know, that is a good point.  He did go to jail, although it's funny how...  They won't let him go with this shit. 
[01:15:30]  There's something such a...  Now I got to support him because he's on my team.  There's such a scumbag thing about what he did.  He did go to jail.  Right.  But the NFL kind of brings this on themselves because they're always moral policing.  Don't say the N-word.  That's going to be a penalty.  Yeah, yeah.  They're always acting like they're so fucking wholesome and they don't want, you know, they don't want this type of language in the locker room.  But meanwhile, he goes to jail for this.  It's confirmed he did it.  Right.  And they're fine with having him in their leagues.  And the NFL is just fucking fraudulent.  The thing is with his crime, you can pay back your debt to society in time in jail, but it doesn't take away what you did. 
[01:16:00]  The ability to do that is still in that motherfucker.  His mindset and personality and everything allowed him to choke the shit out of a fucking dog and watch dogs killing each other like that.  That, to me, is something that you don't fix through prison.  If you're a bank robber, you rob a fucking bank, you go to prison, you pay your debt to society, you get out.  It's not the same. 
[01:16:30]  What was in your head?  Oh, I needed money, so I robbed a bank.  All right.  I could deal with that.  You paid your debt.  But I had these animals fucking torturing each other, and then I was choking them and drowning them.  That, to me, is some mental fucking problem.  This guy should not be fucking playing football.  Hold on, hold on.  I completely agree with you, but I wonder if he ever got therapy for any of that shit.  Therapy, shmarapy.  It's almost like a serial killer.  You just don't think something like that could change at all?  I don't think you can take that out of you. 
[01:17:00]  That's one of those things like fucking serial killers, kid touchers, all that shit.  I think it's just, is it in you?  But he's dealing with it every day, too.  He's not getting away with anything.  Good.  He has to deal with these people every day.  Do you think he should be in the NFL?  No.  I don't.  You think there should be a lifetime ban on Michael Vick?  Yeah, if other people are banned for other things, I mean, you know, that, to me, is one 
[01:17:30]  of the most heinous fucking crimes committed by an NFL player.  Well, because we all care more about dogs than our fellow humans.  We all know that.  Well, of course.  You see a dog, you're like, oh my god.  You never do that with another human being ever.  Innocence of the poor thing.  You know, it's so dependent on people and trusting.  It's also, like, weird.  Because the NFL, again, they bring this on themselves because they act like they're trying  so hard to make it.  Right.  Those scumbags are going after MIA, that rapper. 
[01:18:00]  And she was dumb for giving the finger during the Super Bowl.  It's like, you corny non-rebel.  But they want millions of dollars from her.  Right.  And it's like, that's our idea of immoral behavior.  Right.  But this guy go out and does that, and they're okay.  Even though he's gone to jail, they still, morally, why would you allow him back in?  Right.  But then again, he did pay his debt, so he's got the right to earn a living.  It's kind of hard to say, go to jail, pay your debt.  He did go to jail.  I mean, he gave up a couple years of his life and his career.  So I think maybe you do have to kind of let him play.  I don't know.  But they have given lifetime bans for other things. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, drugs.  Dexter Cuxley and a few other guys.  Right.  Gambling.  If you're gambling, you fucking get...  And this is just, I don't know, it's so despicable.  Yeah.  This fucking guy.  Can I ask you a question?  Yes, sir.  Go ahead, sir.  So, I mean, you just kind of proved my point.  Everybody's appalled at Michael Vick.  But if Dick Caney shoots birds out of the air for amusement, it's not looked at the same  way.  No.  Well...  I think people...  We look at animals very differently. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, different animals.  Dennis Leary had a pretty good bit about that, that we save the cute ones.  Yeah.  And if you're an ugly animal, fuck you, basically.  Well, we operate.  That's his bid in five seconds, but it's actually a really clever bid he does.  I think it's the level of cruelty, too, that it takes.  Right.  I mean, to watch the dogs fight, almost that's something you can be...  But to actually just murder them and drown them and electrocute them, and like, there's  a scumbag, complete, psychotic...  That's serious.  ...ensality, yeah.  Because you don't have the compassion that it takes to function in a normal society, if 
[01:19:30]  you can do that.  But the other side of it, but it's the culture.  Culture smulcher.  You guys don't understand.  It's part of the culture.  Despicable culture.  But this guy raises a good point, though, about, like, birds.  Like, what would happen if you just released a bunch of dogs and hunted them?  People would be out of their minds, but if someone goes bird hunting, why is that?  I mean, that's kind of right.  There is...  Oh, yeah.  There's no rhyme or reason to it.  You can't put every animal on the face of the earth on the same fucking scale and think  we feel the same about all of them. 
[01:20:00]  I bet you God would, though.  Nah.  I bet you God would.  I don't think he would.  I don't.  You don't think God would?  Nah.  Think all animals are pretty much equal?  In his eyes?  Yeah, and then we're like, you know, the shit.  Yeah.  He's poking his eye out of that black hole right now, looking at us.  That's where the God is.  He made us in his image.  He certainly did.  Can we play the Dennis Leary bit into break about animals?  I think it's off No Cure for Cancer, I believe. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, yeah?  Is it reasonable?  I think it's pretty reasonable.  Thank you, John.  Thanks, guys.  You made some good points there, sir.  A point on his head.  Part of it, getting back in the NFL required him to do a lot of charity work.  All right.  Whatever.  But that's not changing the mindset.  I think that's pretty on point with that.  John Wayne Casey fucking gave money to the Boy Scouts.  Would that make him a good guy?  Sure.  A good fella?  It's just the idea that they're so holier than thou, and they're trying so hard to make 
[01:21:00]  it, but they don't give a fuck what their players do.  As long as it's not gambling, which could affect the game.  Right.  But don't use this language, and don't say that in a lot more.  Richie Incognito bullied.  Oh, fucking NFL.  I can't even watch football anymore.  I hate them so much.  Yeah, bullying has made it into the NFL.  That's ridiculous.  As they try to knock each other's heads off every Sunday.  And I don't think people realize.  But they can't handle bad words in a locker room.  Yeah, bad words.  I'm not saying that the literal killing of the animal. 
[01:21:30]  That's horrible, what he did.  And if he paid his debt to society for that, then you could say, all right, you know, he  can work.  He could do whatever he wants.  He went to jail.  It's the ability to do it.  But the ability of a human being to be that cruel to another living animal, it shows something  that you have inside you, or the lack of something that you should have inside you, some type of 
[01:22:00]  compassion and feeling, guilt, any of that shit.  He's devoid of it, obviously.  Right.  But, you know, and to have someone like that in an organization where, like Jimmy said,  you know, is trying to be this moral fucking upright standard of the country.  Go fuck yourself, ponies.  How about that?  If the NFL wants to language, police, and obsess, do not allow anybody with a felony type 
[01:22:30]  of criminal record into your league.  There you go.  If they commit any type of a felony while they're in football, how about this?  Their contract is completely voided out, and they don't play ever again.  There you go.  Why don't you do that?  If you're going to make a moral stand, make a moral stand.  If not, just shut the fuck up and realize that it's just a dumb game, and if the guys  don't have great morals, so what?  Who cares?  All right.  Doug in Boston.  Doug.  Yes, Opie.  God does not see all animals the same, obviously.  You know, the snake made him crawl on his belly and being mad. 
[01:23:00]  Like a serpent.  That's true.  God hates a serpent.  Right.  You can't eat the cloven hoof animals.  The pigs are dirty.  He rocked.  You know how to eat shrimp.  Not a lot to eat shrimp, too, right?  Shellfish.  Shrimps.  Yes.  Right.  I like them scrimps.  All right.  Thank you, Doug.  You got Dexter Manley, by the way.  Thank you for the correction on Twitter.  It was Dexter Manley, right?  Is it the one about eating meat?  Eating meat.  Yeah, it might be.  Opening a restaurant and stuff like that. 
[01:23:30]  Is it off No Cure?  Yeah.  I don't know if it's the one you're thinking of, but we can play it.  I'm trying to remember what the track is.  Yeah, just play it.  It'll be all right, I guess.  We'll be back.  All right.  Back to this Nick Cannon thing.  We went off-roading a bit there.  He's got a new album coming out called White People Party Music, and to promote it, he's  dressed as a white person.  And I swear this doesn't bother me as a white person, but what does bother me, if any white musician did the blackface thing, there'd be such outrage. 
[01:24:00]  Well, we get the...  So what does that say?  Black people are weaker and they can't handle it?  Like, what's...  That's what the...  It's paternalism, by the meaner, of course.  Yeah, paternalism.  Paternalism.  That's what it is.  Because I don't find that to be offensive or upsetting.  Because I don't think many white people would be bothered by what Nick Cannon's doing.  And he makes it a horrendous white person, by the way.  Well, it's because you have to look at all the pain and anger that was caused years and years and years ago. 
[01:24:30]  And that gets dredged up when white people dress as black people.  But, you know, black people dressed as white people.  We've had this white privilege for so long.  This is a reaction to our behavior.  That is fine.  Oh.  We could put up with anything because we've had the white privilege.  Although he did have a funny tweet.  He said, I can't believe...  That's impossible.  It's Nick Cannon.  Oh, shit.  What was the funny tweet?  I like Nick Cannon.  He said, I can't believe all the hate. 
[01:25:00]  And he didn't even let me finish.  Was that the other tweet?  No.  Oh, I'm sorry.  He said, I can't believe all the hate I'm getting.  Be more funny!  That's a horrible tweet.  I didn't finish.  What?  I didn't finish what I was saying.  Oh, oh, oh.  He said something to the effect...  The Negro.  Oh.  That's not what he said.  What?  That's not what he said.  What did he say?  Will you just say it?  Something to the effect of...  Any person.  Oh.  Why would he say that?  Jesus.  He didn't say that.  Oh.  He said something to the effect of...  Oh. 
[01:25:30]  I'm starting to think that you don't care what he said.  Oh, man.  I thought the tweet was over.  No, I didn't even start it.  Oh.  Something to the effect of...  I can't believe all the hate I'm getting for this.  So much for my, quote, white privilege.  That's a hoot.  That's a hoot.  Kind of acknowledging...  You know.  Wow.  Yeah, you have to explain it.  Fucking...  Thanks, Sam. 
[01:26:00]  There's a black privilege.  Thanks, Sam.  I do wonder where the audience starts to get so ornery from.  What?  Where do they pick that up from?  I don't know.  It's true.  Learned it from you, okay?  Learned it from you.  There's a black privilege.  I was thinking about some of the black privilege that goes on.  Of course you were.  I'm sure you were with a drink in one hand and a pistol in the other.  Alone.  And I'm sure Beavis had to hear it.  Beavis gets to listen to all of my rants.  Poor little kitty.  He just sits there.  He just wants to knead the blanket.  Meow.  Meow. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  I don't think there's anybody else in this country that can get away with speaking as poorly as so many members of the black community.  Politicians, religious leaders, sports figures, celebrities.  When you can give an interview and the news is broadcasting what you're saying and you're saying stuff to the effect of like, well, she ain't that or he ain't go there. 
[01:27:00]  He ain't go there.  Shit like that.  And it's completely accepted.  Like it's accepted.  No one calls anyone out on it.  If a black person speaks poor English, it's just accepted.  And then the privilege part comes in, whereas if you're educated, well-spoken and articulate, you write your own fucking ticket in this world today, in this country.  If you're a young black guy or a woman and you speak impeccable English, you are getting a job long before your white counterpart is. 
[01:27:30]  But the reason black unemployment is so high, what fucking guy or woman wants to hire someone that cannot even speak properly?  You want someone representing your company that does not even speak properly?  Whose grammar is just a fucking abomination?  Why haven't you said this before?  I say this every month, whether I need it or not. 
[01:28:00]  And that's just here on the air.  Thank you.  All right.  I had to get that out of my system.  So can we hear Nick Cannon's party song?  Would you want to hear the video clips?  I would like to.  Connor Smallnut.  Oh, he's doing a character.  Like Mr. I.  Mr. I.  So basically, he's saying like, you small nut, like you little dick, which again, fair enough.  Right.  But if you're a white comic and you do the reverse, everyone knows, if you don't think that white people run things. 
[01:28:30]  Tyrone Big Dick.  So if you did that, people expect so much more out of white people.  So the next time a white guy does all that black stuff and they get in trouble, why don't we just play the Nick Cannon stuff?  It won't matter.  It won't matter.  It won't matter.  The press will never go, oh, you're right.  We suck.  The press will never do that.  No.  And both are done with humor.  Right.  In mind.  They kind of had a racist.  But then, of course, the media has to, you know, obviously, you know, twist it.  The whole nappy head at home.  I'll always go back to that fucking thing. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  Because that day, Imus was just trying to be fucking funny.  Trying to be funny.  There was no hate behind that.  Throwing out some shit.  Whether it's funny or not is up to the listener.  That's fine.  But there's no doubt in my mind he was just going for funny that day.  I shouldn't have done that.  Then he had to deal with Reverend Al and his daughter.  Reverend Al, bend over and I'll kiss your black ass.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You don't remember when he brought the daughter in?  Oh, I said her dumb daughter.  Yeah, of course.  And she's standing there with her arms folded looking at Imus like he's the white devil. 
[01:29:30]  Is this a nappy headed hoe to you?  Let me see her iPod.  Why would you deal with that shit?  Let me see her iPod.  Let's see what she's got on the iPod.  Yeah.  I understand why I guess Imus would have to deal with that, but fuck that.  All right, Nick Cannon.  Let's see his character.  Connor Smallnut.  All right.  Connor Smallnut's the name, bro.  That's it?  Well, that's the first one.  That's the whole clip? 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  It's an Instagram video.  Yeah, but you got 15 seconds on Instagram.  17, I think.  17?  You don't have to use them all.  And then in this photo...  Because he had nothing.  Because he sucks.  In this photo, he is hashtagging.  Hashtag good credit.  Hashtag dog kissing.  Hashtag beer pong.  Hashtag farmer's market.  These are all things that are supposed to be synonymous with white people.  You know what?  Cream cheese eating.  Can I do that?  Hashtag murder.  Hashtag robbery. 
[01:30:30]  Hashtag drug use.  Hashtag no father.  How about that?  How about we fucking do that?  Or if you just did it with nice...  Or just do it with nice things associated with black people.  So they can't...  Yeah, yeah.  But you'd still get shit.  Even if you did it with, like, fun things associated with black people, you'd still get shit for it.  Yeah.  Because he's not being...  Basketball.  Yeah, yeah.  However it was, you would still...  No swimming.  Because if you do stuff like murder...  That's not good.  And no father...  You're kind of giving them an excuse to go, well, you're being...  But if you do it like he did it, just look exactly like a black guy, but just do fun things associated with black people... 
[01:31:00]  Come up with some.  You're still getting shit.  White girls.  White girls.  All right, let's see this.  This next video.  The first one was amazing.  This is Connor Smallnut impressed with a black guy's rapping abilities.  Okay.  This guy's good, bro.  He's gone.  He's like, freestyle.  It won't go wrong.  Someone's saying this guy.  It won't go wrong.  Will we ever take advice?  Go strong when Martin Luther King said, let freedom ring. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, he's good.  See, I got no problem.  I'm so annoyed with this, but not because of Nick, but because I know what the reaction would  be the other way.  Right.  Exactly.  I kind of like that he's doing this because his image is so clean cut and controversy-free.  Yeah.  And he's doing...  He's kind of going over the top and doing something to antagonize people, which I do  kind of like that he's doing that.  And then when all the controversy broke out, he posted a photo of himself in whiteface and 
[01:32:00]  wrote, dude, everybody chillax.  Did he...  He's got people talking.  Is there any shit from the network on it or no?  From NBC?  Yeah.  I haven't heard...  I don't think so.  Did he let Mariah know that that was really him, or did she get confused and think that  there was another man in the house?  She's dumb, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, my brothers aren't going to be happy.  Oh, boy.  That's their old friend.  Well, it's the hero of Harborfield. 
[01:32:30]  That's right.  Tell them to help us out, get her on the show.  We'll interview her.  How do you hit those notes?  Yes, that squeaky thing.  You think I'm at least number two at Harborfield High School?  You are number two.  Without you.  You definitely...  I think there's...  What's the drop-off, though?  Who's number three?  I don't know.  I wonder who would be considered three.  Maybe I'm considered three.  Who the hell else has been out of Harborfield?  I don't know.  Maybe someone can help me out with that.  Harborfield High School. 
[01:33:00]  I know I'm number one from John H. Glenn.  You're number one?  I gotta be.  Do you mean you're number one in your high school?  I gotta be.  All-time graduate?  I don't know.  I didn't graduate.  Success rate?  Aries Spears went...  I think Aries Spears went to North Brunswick High School.  You know, I don't think there's that many besides me and him that actually went into this business.  So, I don't know.  Could you look up famous Harborfield...  Harborfield High School graduates?  I have real bad news.  Oh, fuck.  I'm not number two?  What?  You're healthy?  Am I even on that list? 
[01:33:30]  I'm not even on the list.  It's like, this is why I don't get bothered by Twitter.  So mean.  Yes.  GH is nowhere near the list.  Jesus Christ.  Who came out of Harborfield?  No.  Notable alumni.  Go ahead.  They don't even put me on the fucking list.  Well, Mariah Carey's number one.  Of course.  She should be.  Right.  The inventor of the Palm Pilot, Jeff Hawkins.  Holy shit.  Where's the Palm Pilot now?  Where is it?  Exactly.  That's true.  Come on.  Professional polo player, Ken Creswell. 
[01:34:00]  Kenny Creswell's a big deal.  You like it, huh?  Better than a polo player?  Kenny Creswell Nation.  Oh.  Famous actress, Jacqueline DeSantis.  Who's that?  I don't know, but...  Who's that?  I don't know.  Look her up.  I didn't even make the fuck up.  Jacqueline DeSantis.  You didn't even make the list.  The Palm Pilot guy.  And a polo player.  She's best known for playing Maggie on the NBC television series Windfall.  Yeah, I get it. 
[01:34:30]  Come on.  I'm getting fucked over by my old high school.  Oh, he doesn't get that?  What did I do wrong there?  Oh, I see.  Yeah.  I'm on there?  No, no, no.  Fuck!  You got replaced by musician Buzzy Feetan.  Buzzy Feetan?  Who's Buzzy Feetan?  What are they, socks or something?  Oh, Buzzy.  We hardly knew you.  Who's Buzzy?  Oh, at one point he jammed with Eric Clapton. 
[01:35:00]  The Butterfield Blues Band?  Is he in that?  Bag of shite.  That still isn't him.  I despise Buzzy.  Keep going.  Uh, oh, Republican New York State Senator John Flanagan.  Flanagan.  Exactly.  Relax.  That's what you say when you're having dessert at a Spanish guy's house.  What's it?  Flanagan.  Boo.  Boo.  Fucking boo.  I went to school with the Flanagans.  Let's relax.  Oh.  Keep going.  Who else?  Director of the Tribeca Film Festival, Jeffrey Gilmore. 
[01:35:30]  It's from Harborfields High School?  Yep.  And on the list that you are not on.  Oh.  Oh, I see why you wouldn't be on this list.  Why?  Uh, the well-known actress, Christine Harnos.  Who's she?  What the hell is she in?  Well, you may know her.  I thought I was number two.  I'm not even on the list.  Harnos.  Terrible.  Uh, as, uh, the first wife of main character Mark Green on ER.  Oh, big turkeys.  But in her description, listen to her description on wiki.  She is a graduate of Harborfields High School, where fellow alumni include Mariah Carey. 
[01:36:00]  Uh-oh.  Do it!  And Greg Hughes.  It says it right there!  On the R.P. and Anthony show.  It does?  In her wiki page.  Let's head back to the high school page where you are not listed.  Wait, can we, can I see what she looks like?  Oh.  Seriously, uh, Christine Hamos.  Or Harnos.  Her?  I don't know.  No, no, no.  All right, keep going.  She threw your bones, too.  This is a very sad day. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, actor, playwright, and producer, Charles Ludlum.  All right, stop laughing at me.  Charles Ludlum.  Oh.  What was that?  I am getting mushroom stamped.  That's bad.  You are.  I'm getting mushroom stamped.  You really are.  All right, my own, my old high school.  Major League Lacrosse player, Mark Millen.  I knew the Millens, too.  What's he doing, Jim?  Nothing.  I'm just saying he hangs out with his friends, Mark, uh, Mark Billen and Steve Trillin. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Is it really that funny?  Billen and Trillin.  Okay.  Right now, right now.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  The fucking, the great sisters.  Quintillins.  I'm tired and bombing.  I love it.  Artist, Cindy Sherman.  What does she do?  She paints tanks.  All right, Jesus. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, women's soccer Olympian from the United States, Sarah Whelan.  Oh, no.  Oh, Iraq.  We know Sarah Whelan.  You know her.  I don't know her.  She's recent.  Keep going.  Another lacrosse player in the major league.  Oh, Jesus.  How was Harborfield's lacrosse team?  Pretty good.  Exactly right.  Their LBGT fucking representation is obviously very strong.  My brother got a scholarship playing lacrosse at Harborfield's high school.  Bill Day. 
[01:38:00]  Bill Day.  Musician Brian Daniels.  All right.  Now, you're just rubbing it in now.  Who's Brian Daniels?  You know Brian Daniels?  Charlie's less famous brother.  Country singer.  Look how lame his Wikipedia page is.  There's nothing.  There's nothing even there.  He's saying the devil took a bus disconnected.  Nobody cares.  And one last person on the list.  Yeah.  And she's kind of in the profession.  Yeah.  She's a professional voice actress. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, shit.  Oh, good.  Who's this?  Brittany Lauda.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  That's not what they say to her when she's whispering.  I think it's Lauda.  I think I went through with some Laudas.  Yeah?  Well, let me see what she looks like.  Hmm.  Wow, I just got mushroom stamped.  That was bad.  By the tornadoes.  She doesn't even have a wiki page.  She doesn't even have a wiki page?  No, and she's more famous than you.  Could you just pop up John H. Glenn in Elwood? 
[01:39:00]  Hold on.  Yeah.  Before you move on.  I'd love to say.  One more.  Dan in Binghamton.  Dan.  Hey, Hope.  I'm sorry to have to continue the mushroom stamping, but you're definitely below Jeff Hawkins.  He's not only the inventor of the Palm Pilot, but he's like one of the most famous neuroscientists  in the world now.  Oh, boy.  He was paying attention.  He paid attention.  How old is he?  Did I go to school?  I think he's probably around your age, man. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, shit.  42?  I don't really know how old he is.  Somebody.  Jesus.  Somebody was listening.  I wonder if I went to school with him.  I got to look him up.  Oh, you got a good class.  Thank you, sir.  What happened?  You got a lot of cool people at your school.  What are you talking about?  So, wait.  Ant's not going to be number one?  Come on.  At least he's on the list.  Yeah.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  So, you don't get mushroom stamped?  Although, this is definitely putting into question child of the 80s, but...  Oh, no. 
[01:40:00]  We'll start with Gene Sinanti, who's the wife of a famed flutist.  Flutist?  I have no idea.  Wayne Kofie.  Who's that?  Sports author of the Daily News.  Oh, there you go.  Anthony Cumia.  Hey.  Co-host of the Opian Anthony Show.  Parentheses.  Dropout.  That's right, motherfuckers. 
[01:40:30]  That's a mushroom stamp.  That was a little...  That was a little mushroom stamp.  They wanted to dig at me a little bit.  A little bit.  They tapped you with a mushroom.  Uh, Richard Heidorn Jr.  He's an award-winning investigative business journalist for the Philadelphia Inquirer.  Yawn.  This one is a little weird.  D-Von Dudley from the Dudley Boys, except he graduated from New Rochelle High School.  So maybe he did a...  Let's say Dudleys.  Maybe he did a couple years there.  A John Glenn?  Then a couple years.  And I'm related to him. 
[01:41:00]  Look at the last name.  Hughes.  I should have, uh...  I'm related to the Dudley Boys.  He didn't graduate from there.  He graduated from New Rochelle High School.  Neither did I, though.  Is he a Black Hughes, though?  He is.  He's one of the...  But he's a Black Dudley Boy, so it makes sense.  You know what that means.  I get it.  We were nice, too.  Yeah.  He was the one guy in John Glenn, by the way.  Jesus.  Oh, really?  Oh, what a white school.  It was like paradise.  Cousin Sal.  Huh?  Jimmy Kimmel.  Yeah? 
[01:41:30]  Cousin Sal.  Went to your high school.  Really?  What's his last name?  Sal.  I...  Iacano.  Sal Iacano.  I mean, he's not exactly in your graduating class.  I know a lot of the families around the area.  Oh.  Another WWE personality.  What?  Ashley Mazzaro.  Former WWE diva.  Look at this.  Look at you.  Paul Stephen Miller.  Oh, I remember him.  Paul Miller was the...  He was the midget guy.  I think he's dead. 
[01:42:00]  All right.  He was a politician guy, right?  Yep.  I saw him at the reunion.  All right.  A midget politician.  Holy shit.  Well, he was like an advisor.  Wow.  David Spurgle.  A true asshole.  Oh, yeah.  David Spurgle?  David Spurgle.  He's a theoretical astrophysicist.  Oh, braggart.  No dropout with parentheses.  Nerd.  Next to his phone.  Fucking nerd.  No pussy in parentheses.  And Jack Canfora, a playwright.  Playwright. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, boy.  Drama club.  Exactly.  I got to tell you.  You could argue that it's the...  I'm up there.  Numero uno.  Especially since David Spurgle didn't graduate from that high school.  No, no.  Well, neither did I.  Fuck.  But dropout.  Dropout.  It says dropout.  You're the most famous dropout for sure, for sure.  I am.  At least you make the list.  I make that list.  Yeah, you're not even close.  Fuck.  You're right.  All these years just walking around saying, you know, I'm number two behind Mariah Carey  at Harborfields High School.  Not even so.  We're not even on the list.  No.  Who was that other guy? 
[01:43:00]  Palm Pilot guy.  Who's the Palm Pilot guy?  Who's the Palm Pilot guy?  The guy who created the Palm Pilot.  There we go.  Look him up.  Jeff Hawkins.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  He's doing one of those speeches like they do at those big companies.  Get a bigger picture of him.  Oh, he invented the trio after he invented the Palm Pilot.  When was he born?  1957.  Oh, my sister probably knows, man.  Damn.  I think my sister, my older sister. 
[01:43:30]  A couple of bucks.  That guy's got a couple of bucks.  You've got to go to North Brunswick.  I wanted to see if I think I'm on that list.  If I'm not, there's going to be hell to pay.  Jimmy.  Now we check out Jimmy.  See if he's number one, two, three.  What number should I be, really?  You're not on the list.  You should be number two.  No, this Jeff Hawkins guy, though.  They should be number two.  He met the Palm Pilot.  He gives a fuck.  I think of you.  Ask people.  But he's a neurosurgeon or something, too.  That's great.  Good for him.  Yeah.  All right.  Is Jimmy on the list? 
[01:44:00]  Yes, he is.  Fuck!  That's a very small list.  Really?  Yeah.  Jim Norton.  Mm-hmm.  Tim Howard, who's the first-choice goalkeeper for the U.S. national team.  For what sport?  Soccer, I guess.  He previously played with Manchester United.  Oh, boy.  Geez, that's pretty huge, actually.  That's big.  Right.  And, uh, Vashaya Ramsey.  Yeah.  Celebrity makeup artist. 
[01:44:30]  She works with Beyonce, Jennifer Hudson, featured in Vogue, L Avenue, The New York Times,  and Oprah.  Sounds like she only walks around with certain shades of makeup in her bag, huh?  Well, probably...  Jimmy's a strong number one there.  Oh, yeah.  Strong number one.  I thought Harry Spears might have went to my school, too.  Maybe I'm wrong.  Jimmy's got it.  Strong number one.  Damn, Ope.  But most importantly, he is on the list.  Oh, very good news, Sam.  I'm getting word from Jimmy in Oklahoma City.  He says, go back to Ope's high school's Wikipedia page.  It's been updated. 
[01:45:00]  Oh.  Oh, I love an updated Wikipedia page.  Oh, yeah, it's always updated.  Oh.  Okay.  Let's see here.  There it is.  Oh, look at that.  Alumni number one on the list ahead of Mariah Carey.  Wow.  Greg Opie Hughes, radio host.  Wow.  Okay.  All right.  So maybe I've been rectified.  Maybe I missed that.  Well, can you go down two more posts?  My name appears again.  Thank you.  Oh, wow.  You're on the list twice.  How'd I miss that?  Greg Opie Hughes, one of the top radio personalities on the planet and creator of the Opie and Anthony 
[01:45:30]  show.  Oh, guys.  Wow.  Congrats.  It's got to be true.  It's on Wikipedia.  Wiki never lies.  I'm taking my mushroom stamp off my forehead.  That's it.  You're number one now.  How the fuck am I not even listed?  Jesus.  Well, why did I put all that time and effort into Harbourfield?  Right?  Tell them to go screw.  Cindy Sherman.  The tank woman.  They probably never got over the fact that I was getting free sodas. 
[01:46:00]  Probably holding against me still.  That thin little arms making its way off the machine.  Skinny arm that was able to get in those machines and push those buttons.  Fucking rock.  I don't like that Jim doesn't have the dropout tag on him.  He gets credit for graduating.  Well, I got a GED.  Oh.  But I did drop out.  I dropped out senior year.  Whoop-dee-doo.  Yeah.  Fucking GED.  How's that working for you?  Obviously not well.  Can we finally hear Nick Cannon's new song from White People Party Music? 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  Are we done with his videos?  Those amazing videos he did?  That was the end of it.  Pretty good.  Pretty good stuff.  This is Pajama Pants.  Nick Cannon featuring Migos Traffic.  T-R-A-P-H-I-K.  Of course.  And Future.  Why can't you spell it properly?  Future.  P-H-U-T.  No?  Especially if he's doing the white guy thing.  Traffic should be spelled properly.  Or Traffic is his own entity.  Another person.  Yeah, but...  Oh, okay.  Good point.  I'm fresh, I'm fresh. 
[01:47:00]  I'm fresh, I'm fresh.  Wow, wow.  Nick Cannon.  Oh, of course.  We have to shout out everybody names.  Start singing.  Woo!  It, it, it, it.  Get it poppin', get it poppin'.  Get it poppin'.  Get it poppin'.  Get it poppin'.  Get it poppin'.  Is this supposed to be good?  It's White People Party Music.  Uh.  Tuck, tuck, tuck, tuck.  I'm fresh today.  I need an ambulance.  I like a van, Puerto Rican on a handstand. 
[01:47:30]  Never talk about what she be wearing up in the club.  I'm talking about what it is.  Club.  More club shit.  Get it poppin' in them pajama pants.  That's Nick Cannon.  Get it poppin'.  Get it poppin'.  Get it poppin'.  Get it poppin'.  I just don't get this whole culture.  I'm done.  We are worlds apart.  We are worlds apart.  What?  You don't like going to the club?  No, I don't understand any of this nonsense.  There's some poppin' going on. 
[01:48:00]  Nonsense.  This is just kind of a goofball.  Is this a joke?  I don't know.  I guess.  You say nigga?  I thought I heard that.  I'm going to be surprised.  I would.  If Nick Cannon had that in the song, I would.  I think he's got it before.  Oh, okay.  He's got your grandma twerk, twerking out of bloomers.  Look at them strippers.  Yeah, he's kidding around a little bit there.  See? 
[01:48:30]  He's got grandma twerking out of bloomers.  Twerking out of bloomers.  Twerking out of bloomers.  I'm fresh to death.  I need an ambulance.  I like a bad Puerto Rican on a handstand.  Never talk about what's he been wearing up in the car.  We're done.  We're good.  White people party music.  Whatever.  That'll do well for them.  That is not white people party music.  I beg to differ.  No.  White bitches are going to love that.  It's no Corey Feldman.  Right.  How's that for a segue?  Is this another video he made or the same one? 
[01:49:00]  No, it's a different video.  It is, right?  Yes.  What is he doing?  What is Corey Feldman doing?  I think he's hurting.  He is going viral, though.  He's still hurting?  I think he might be hurting.  Hurting.  I think so.  What are he hurting about these days?  This video sucks?  What is this one another?  Does he dance around like Michael Jackson in this one, too?  I don't know.  Fuck.  It's called Duh, right?  That's right.  Yeah.  Duh?  Yeah, you got to see this.  The amazing Corey Feldman drops his equally amazing video for Duh, and it's amazing. 
[01:49:30]  Fish rapper.  You mean to skip the intro?  No, man.  I like it.  I love you.  Who's the broad?  That's his jealous wife.  He never actually listens to me.  He only plays with his instruments, and he has about 18 instruments, and I don't know  which one he's using at what time, and he's usually just tweeting from all 18 of them.  You know, sometimes I'm just trying to get work done, and it's like, I feel like she  doesn't even understand me.  It drives me crazy because I'm just...  Oh, I love you!  See what I mean?  Oh, holy shit. 
[01:50:00]  No sex for two weeks.  Really, really, really.  I think they're making fun of reality shows.  Hey, how are you?  Good to see you.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, how are you?  It's so long, I'm the guy.  Hi.  Oh, hey!  Hi, Cory.  Oh, my God, you look so cute today.  Oh, wait, you better fit.  Oh, thanks.  Yeah, it makes you a little...  I don't want to do this.  You don't?  No.  I don't either.  What is it?  What are we doing?  I asked if you wanted to skip the intro.  Yeah, I thought it was an intro. 
[01:50:30]  It's a long intro.  Half the goddamn piece of shit video.  It's a music video.  I hate music videos with acting.  Acting.  Oh, nice.  Boobies.  I don't know.  It's just duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  There we go.  You must be divine to be an angel.  For an angel can do no wrong.  As long as it's done under the halo.  Duh.  Martin, Michael Jackson.  Oh, he's doing the Michael Jackson thing.  Oh, this is him.  Duh. 
[01:51:00]  I love Cory instead of I Love Lucy.  Yeah.  This guy's great.  Good special effects.  It's a funny video.  Black and white, like his.  We're kind of like doing Lucy stuff.  I threw flour on the lady.  Oh, now he's dancing.  Wait.  Michael Jackson moves for sure.  Listen to his voice.  What is he doing with this Michael Jackson thing?  He's still doing it. 
[01:51:30]  He's still doing it.  He's a grown man.  Do you like his?  No, I'm embarrassed.  Look at him doing his Michael Jackson moves.  He's got the hat.  He's a grown walker.  It's.  You get the hair like Michael Jackson.  Yes.  Get Michael's doctor. 
[01:52:00]  Wait, I'm enjoying that.  That's really good.  And he's doing like me.  He's doing that.  And he grabs his dick.  Yeah.  This is what happens when you don't have friends that tell you you stink.  Wow.  Right?  Honeymooners take off, kind of.  Oh, yeah.  A little bit.  He'll actually have a video showing party and they'll go, this is great. 
[01:52:30]  Ah, it's funny too.  Ah, there he goes.  He's doing it.  He's good, this guy.  He's doing like this dance.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  The hot girls don't even make up for how shitty this video is.  But you have to watch this in front of people and they'll go, that's good.  And you'll go, yeah, thanks.  That's great, man.  Wow, Corey, that's going to be a hit. 
[01:53:00]  What a good song.  What's he doing?  Oh, now he's rapping.  So he's got a hoodie on and sunglasses.  He's good.  Listen to his rapping.  Okay, at least he knows he sucks. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, I hate wacky, funny music videos.  He's got one, two, three, four.  He's got one, two, three, four.  I try to type out.  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's so evil.  I'm having a hard time.  I want the audience to hear this entire song and enjoy it.  Hopi, I want them to enjoy this song.  You think they're going to like it?  No.  Oh, that's great. 
[01:54:00]  That's great.  There we go.  I was watching my own video.  Oh.  Is that one over?  That one is over.  Okay.  That was a hunk of shit.  Of shite.  That was a big steaming pile of dog shit.  Right. 
[01:54:30]  Goddamn.  Corey Feldman.  Michael Jackson dancing.  I'll get it.  I mean, there's...  Oh, blowing is great.  No, no, no.  That's a good one.  We've got to stop.  Farrah Abraham.  I'm just saying.  Blowing.  She stinks.  That's one of my big regrets.  Oh, you're a song.  We had a...  We should have...  Duh.  But look what she did.  We let her off so easy with that fake sex tape.  But look what she does.  It's great.  Yeah, it wasn't stolen.  It was shot. 
[01:55:00]  It was so obviously shot.  We should have probably pushed her a little more.  Oh, my God.  God, it's something.  Then why didn't you push Bill Knox more?  I don't know.  I pushed my dick in her ass.  Nice.  I don't want to push.  I don't know why.  Right?  Noice.  I know Farrah Abrams bothers me way more than Bill Knox.  She's terrible.  Way more.  Are you watching that couples therapy where she's on the show because she made believe she had a boyfriend?  No.  And then it turns out she doesn't really have a boyfriend, but she's on couples therapy anyway.  I got to get on that.  Oh, my God. 
[01:55:30]  She stinks.  Yeah, but you know what?  She's a musician.  You haven't given her a chance.  Oh, yeah.  Her voice is so clean.  They didn't put anything on it.  Are we really doing this now?  Just a little.  But just a little.  It's not an audience.  Farrah Abrams was from Teen Mom.  There is no audience.  She's been on the show before, though.  There is no audience for this video.  Teen Mom?  She was on Teen Mom.  I've heard this song.  It's good.  You like it.  I do.  Jimmy likes it.  Have you heard it?  It's horrible.  It's good.  You enjoy this song?  I do.  I was hoping we weren't going to bring this one to the show, but I'm only one man. 
[01:56:00]  No, but why wouldn't you?  Go ahead.  What, are we supposed to rob the audience?  I think it's good.  I think it's young and relevant.  I think it's sad because there's a lot of these sort of reality stars, and then, you  know, they get the idea they could be...  The next Corey Feldman or something.  Look out.  Pop singers, pop stars.  Right.  You've had a lot of them lately.  Like Paris Hilton.  She had no business putting out that song, but it worked because she had a whole bunch  of producers and stuff behind her.  I think Kim Kardashian's done one, right? 
[01:56:30]  I feel like she has.  Remember Angelina Jersey Shore did one?  She did.  She did.  Remember?  We played on the show.  TMZ League.  It was very, very terrible.  Okay.  Yeah, it's another way to keep your fame going, I guess, but you've got to pay a shitload  to these producers that know what the fuck they're doing in the studio.  Right.  Because it's all studio produced.  And you don't make any money because the songs are so bad.  Well, let's hear Farrah Abrams from Team Mom.  Except for Blowing by Farrah Abrams.  Blowing.  The voice is strong? 
[01:57:00]  Oh, yeah.  Strong.  This is your thing, isn't it?  Yeah, it's my jam.  My jam.  She's blowing all right.  That's a good beat.  You like it?  Yeah, that has nothing to do with her.  Oh.  She's addressing the Twitter haters, too?  Yeah.  You saw the checkmark, though, right?  Yep.  She's having fun with the club.  Julia kicks its ass. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, it does.  Julia.  Julia.  This is so bad.  I like it.  Why would she make a song called Blowing and say,  You're blowing?  Edgar likes it.  Yeah.  This is so bad.  Yes, it is.  Do you think any one of these lines were in, in, in, in any, like a key or, yeah. 
[01:58:00]  It doesn't even rhyme.  She didn't do the music.  She didn't write it.  And she didn't really even sing it.  No.  She sang parts of it.  It was all put together for her.  You saw that, too?  Shit.  Shit.  All right.  Enough of this.  I like it.  That's enough.  That's enough.  You didn't like it?  Can we stop, please?  It's so bad.  I mean, there's just, because it's only less than halfway through is the only thing. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's a lot more to go.  Oh, she's singing the Twitter avatar.  I like this.  That's fun.  That's a good video.  She just wants to make sure everyone knows her Twitter.  Yep.  And I feel like it picks up later.  Yeah.  I don't disagree.  Jeff Dunham's going to be here in about 20 minutes.  I love Jeff Dunham.  I do, too.  Because he's such a happy, like, he's a really funny ventriloquist, like a great ventriloquist,  and then he's just got this, like, fucking dark underbelly, which I love.  Yes.  Yeah, we've had fun with him over the years when he's come in here.  I want to ask him about his bromance with Bruce Jenner. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, you guys don't want...  He's got something going on there?  You don't take a peek at the Kardashians every once in a while.  Jeff Dunham and Bruce Jenner are very close, and people have raised their eyebrows about  it.  Is it still a bromance if certain procedures take place?  Yeah, really?  Do we have the latest picture on Bruce Jenner?  How much of a bro is Bruce Jenner at this point?  Nothing new has come out that I've seen.  I'm blowing.  I'm blowing.  You know that...  I certainly are.  Speaking of trannies... 
[01:59:30]  Oh.  You know that Jerry Springer got in trouble for saying tranny on his show?  When?  And then, I think it's on TMZ, and then Jerry Springer had a whole apology and said,  I just didn't know that's a bad word.  So now tranny's a bad word.  Oh, he says...  Oh, the quote is, I'm removing tranny from my vocabulary, Jerry.  But why is that...  Go to TMZ.  Yeah, here's it.  It's bad.  It's not derogatory in any way.  Read first.  Um...  Jerry Springer just learned a valuable lesson, and now he's retiring the word tranny from 
[02:00:00]  his show forever.  Springer was on TMZ Live today to discuss the backlash over a recent episode of the Jerry  Springer show entitled...  Entitled Trannies Twerk It Out.  There you go.  Jerry!  Love your mission, brother!  Jerry!  Jerry!  Jerry!  Why not?  LGBT groups were not pleased the show used the term tranny.  Oh, God.  We've been using that word forever.  But Springer claims he had no clue he was offending anyone. 
[02:00:30]  That's a thing that they said, we don't like that word because we're supposed to have a word  that we don't like being called.  Everyone needs their word, right?  And there was nothing ever derogatory about a tranny.  It's short for transsexual.  That's it.  Tranny.  Whatever the first word that you call us.  Right.  That all of a sudden has to go to the wayside.  That's the bad word now, and we'll come up with something else, and don't ever use that  one.  Don't make us come up with a new word for that.  Oh, shit.  Right, guys?  How about chicks with dicks? 
[02:01:00]  Oh, shit.  Can we see the clip from the show?  I want to see Tranny's twerking.  Well, this is actually the full episode.  We don't need to.  You want to just see, like, maybe the intro?  Yeah, let's see how Jerry sets up Tranny's twerking.  Isn't he, like, 70?  I know.  He's just like...  Fucking rules.  Well, all he wanted to do was be a politician.  And he loves our show, so...  I'm bummed that he apologized, but I guess he has to.  Yeah.  I guess it's bad for his business.  All right, let me see how many of these girls I know. 
[02:01:30]  Warning.  Warning.  You might question everything you thought you knew about yourself.  Get those dicks out, gentlemen.  You would thought, like...  Well, all right.  So, how would you feel that you hooked up with a transsexual?  A transsexual thought?  Oh, shit.  What?  What?  You can't believe it.  How do you not know?  Probably jumping up the hugger.  Yeah.  How do you not know?  So the jokes on you, sweetie. 
[02:02:00]  Man, sweetie.  How do you not know?  No, you're not.  Yeah.  You're very masculine.  If she was a man, I wouldn't be with her.  Would you leave your wife for a free woman?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  They're making it look like a fucking news report.  More like a horror movie.  Right?  Yeah.  Jerry.  Jerry.  Jerry.  Jerry.  Jerry.  There he is.  They fucking love him still. 
[02:02:30]  I love that Jerry just thinks his show is a goof.  Yeah.  He doesn't care.  He doesn't care.  We can't watch a hell of a Jerry Springer show.  No.  We need Andrea.  She says she's ready to come clean with her feelings.  Andrea, what's going on?  All right.  Hey, Jerry.  Hi.  So, I'm fresh into college, you know, I thought it would be a good chance.  I just want to see the tranny's twerking.  Of course.  Do you want to see his apologies?  So then he said, yeah, he used the term tranny throughout the episode and then he had to apologize  for it because he got attacked by the LGBT people.  Whatever it is.  Or LBGT, LGBT, right? 
[02:03:00]  LGBT.  I don't know why it's a bad, I would love to know why tranny, like I get why most slurs  are bad.  Tranny.  Tranny's just an abbreviation.  Yeah.  Oh.  Because they needed a little power base.  It's really weird.  It's stupid.  Belly Jay always, we talked to Belly about it, Belly says tranny.  Yeah, she doesn't mind tranny.  Tranny.  Did it.  What about the rap that you're using a term that is, that transgender people feel is offensive  to them?  Why? 
[02:03:30]  You mean the term tranny?  Yep.  Yes.  Well, I've just been educated.  I won't use that term.  I mean, honestly, I had no idea that you're not supposed to use that term.  So now we'll find another term to use.  But, yeah, I didn't know that it was offensive to them, and I'm not interested in offending  people.  So, obviously, I'll just...  While you're on the air.  There's no argument there.  You know, that's weird. 
[02:04:00]  People, I look at some apologies like that, and like, we get pissed off about it because  we talk for a living and we see them, but if you're just a guy doing something and  someone's like, that's offensive, a lot of people are like, oh, okay, I'll just use  something else.  Right, right, right.  Like, they don't care that much.  Yeah, Jerry's just like, oh, okay, I didn't know.  I won't use it.  Fuck it.  Yeah, they'll write something else on the card for me to say that.  Right, yeah.  Could someone explain why that word is offensive?  Because I still don't know why people would even think it's offensive.  No one would be able to come up with a good answer as to why tranny is offensive.  Just that every group...  What?  I'm reading the statement from the National Center for Transgender Equality that they put 
[02:04:30]  out when...  How do we have that?  ...when the precious girl got in trouble for saying tranny on Arsenio Hall.  Yeah.  She got in trouble?  She got in trouble?  And they don't even explain why.  They just say using the word tranny isn't okay anymore.  Why?  They don't say.  Like, they're...  It's just not okay.  Because every group needs their word.  Yes.  Well, actually, they want...  It's the only thing.  They want their words.  Yeah.  But they'll start with the one word, and then they'll move on to the next one.  They don't want tranny to be said because they want a power base. 
[02:05:00]  They want to hold something over people.  But then people will just come up with another word for that, and then that word will be bad.  You're not going to change how people think anytime soon.  No, never.  Can we not consult our LGBT expert, Dr. Gay?  Dr. Gay?  Yeah, we did.  Dr. Gay.  So glad.  And they can't even come up as to why tranny is offensive.  No, there's no explanation.  It's just...  I defy any tranny gay person, whatever the fuck, to tell me and convince me that tranny is a derogatory term for transsexual people, and let me know why. 
[02:05:30]  I defy you.  You're doing this wrong.  Girls, give me a call.  Is that it?  Simple as that?  Yeah, exactly.  Girls, please give me a call.  One of you left your magnums at my apartment.  Oh, we'll clear the lines, boys.  Stay tuned.  No, go ahead, Travis.  Gabri tweeted. 
[02:06:00]  She goes, same thing that Jerry said.  I didn't realize it was a slur.  No one does.  So they're not looking at it like trying to be offensive or like...  They're just not interested in the language.  They don't look at it like we do, I guess, for some reason.  She's the only one that shouldn't be using the word tranny.  Oh.  Why do you say that?  Because she's chubby.  Yeah.  If you're chubby, you shouldn't be pointing out, you know...  Other people's things?  Other people's things.  Things.  Luckily, we here at the Opie and Anthony show happen to be flawless.  Exactly.  Oh, thank God for that.  We want.  But if you say chubster, it makes it a little more fun. 
[02:06:30]  Right.  Chubby, not good.  But say, hey, chubster.  You think that's a little nicer?  A little nicer.  Chubster.  Oh, I got you.  I hate the transgendered community.  I don't.  The way that sounds.  I meant the term.  Oh, okay.  The transgendered community.  I just don't know why tranny is offensive.  Yeah.  Like, I feel...  I'm genuinely confused about that.  I don't understand how that's offensive, unless they feel it's dismissive. 
[02:07:00]  Right.  Well, Petey in Texas has something.  Petey.  Okay.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey, Petey.  I was just listening to y'all about this tranny shit now.  I was raised down here in South Texas in the Oldfields all my life, but I got relatives  on Nantucket for which I just came back after two weeks.  Once was a man from there.  You went to Nantucket in the middle of winter?  I have an aunt that lives over there.  She's got a bad...  Only he was able to fillet himself.  So I went over there, but I got to tell you...  He just talked through everything.  What's wrong with your aunt? 
[02:07:30]  I need to know.  Nothing's wrong with her, but I got to tell you...  Why did you go there?  To visit her.  All right.  You picked the worst time.  Nantucket in the summer is awesome.  Yeah.  Well, I used to go in the summer when I was a young lad, and oh, yeah, I used to get  more ass than a city bus bench there back in the middle of winter.  Whoa!  You come up with that?  That's a lot of ass.  But anyway, fellas, the point of my...  Did you actually say that?  He actually said that.  I have never seen such a bunch of uptight, politically correct people. 
[02:08:00]  And I have to ask you, gentlemen, another thing.  How are y'all getting laid up there?  Those women up there are frigid as all hell, man.  Maybe if you sound like that.  You just go to talk to one of the girls.  They look at you like you've got a set of balls with a dick road at your forehead.  I couldn't believe it.  He sounds funny, but he makes very good points.  Women in the New York area are a bunch of bitches.  Wow.  I mean, Massachusetts, wow.  What is the point?  I did much better when I left the Long Island, New York City area. 
[02:08:30]  He's not wrong, man.  A lot of the women have such a major fucking attitude in the New York area.  You know what melts that attitude?  Cold hard cash.  That's right.  And cocaine.  I said the girls down here in the South might not be the sharpest knives in the drawer.  But let me tell you.  Sharpest knives in the drawer.  He's bringing them all out.  He didn't do two in one phone call. 
[02:09:00]  Sharpest knife in the drawer.  Yeah.  But anyway, I just wanted to lay that out there and tell all you girls up there in the Northeast.  Y'all need to take a lesson from the girls in the South and open it up.  Are the girls in New York, you know, a full Happy Meal or are they missing something?  Yeah.  I just don't get it.  I just don't get it.  I just don't get it.  Anyway, y'all, enjoy the hell out of your show.  Oh, thank you, sir.  Of course you do.  All right.  Thank you.  This guy's not the sharpest pencil in the box. 
[02:09:30]  In the oil field.  Yeah.  Not the brightest crayon.  Bailey said something in the tweet.  Oh.  Lots of men misunderstood my tweet.  I guess she had tweeted it.  In short, tranny slash she-male are porn words like slut and whore.  Or girls like me are trans women in real life.  Ugh.  Oh.  It's cutting hairs.  Yeah.  After a while, it's cutting hairs.  Well, I'm trying to think of what the equivalent would be.  Like, how is tranny or she-male like slut and whore? 
[02:10:00]  It's not like slut and whore.  That's not always your intention.  No, no, no.  I don't fucking know.  Whatever.  It's becoming ridiculous.  Jeff Dunham on the way.  Stay there.  I'm coming in in a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  I just saw him on Fox.  Ahchmed Saves America premieres on CMT this Friday, March 28th.  Oh.  But then it says out now on DVD.  Hmm.  So it's premiering on CMT, but it's out now on... 
[02:10:30]  Out not on DVD.  What?  Out not on DVD.  Out on DVD.  I don't know.  I'm very confused by this.  We'll have to ask him about it.  We certainly will.  I watched a reality show last night.  It was called Cougar Wives.  Oh, I saw some people tweeting about that.  It was so bad.  In what way?  It's these, like, old broads with these young guys. 
[02:11:00]  Right.  And the young guys, they're just gay guys.  They're gay guys.  I don't know what it is.  Like, I think there's this maternal thing that if a guy's gay and doesn't want to go the  gay with another man, but wants some kind of intimacy, you know, with somebody, he just  gets an old lady.  Because then you don't have to worry about, like, sex, really.  Is he getting some cash out of it, though? 
[02:11:30]  Maybe it's a way to get some money.  Nah, I don't know.  There was one...  Do you have a clip?  There was one where it was...  The guy was so obviously gay.  And to answer your question...  Cougar Wives.  Cougar Wives.  Cougar Wives on TLC.  Just another asshole?  Oh, just a scumbag.  With no one listening to him.  I love it.  Oh, okay.  No.  Little wants a voice and no one will hear.  Oh, you've got to love it.  Oh, my God!  What is that?  That's Hattie. 
[02:12:00]  What?  That's Hattie.  Wait, wait.  Go back.  This is on TLC?  Oh, yeah.  Did it just start up?  I think so.  We might have a new show.  It's the first five scene of it.  I was watching it last night.  Cougar Wives.  We might have a new show to check out.  All right.  Go all the way back.  Oof.  Oof.  Here we go.  Hattie.  That is extreme.  25, not too young.  You are not too young.  There are a lot of people who use the word cougar to describe an older woman who sleeps  with a younger man. 
[02:12:30]  Let's go.  I'm 37 years older than he is.  Yeah.  That's really disgusting.  You can't control who you fall in love with.  It's amazing that falling in love will be for your self-image.  The guy that the last guy was the K guy.  Like, how long?  Really?  How the hell am I going to tell my parents?  Dave Kroll.  You enjoy it?  Yes.  Skin.  I love skin.  You have a lot of it.  This is bothering me.  Why doesn't it bother mom?  I love her.  Is this real?  Is this bullshit? 
[02:13:00]  I don't know.  That's kind of fake.  That guy is really good.  What do you want to tell you?  I fell like you.  He's got his chest out when he's meeting.  I like this guy.  You like him?  She's a little older than your mother.  Oh, Kevin.  Kevin.  Oh, God.  I didn't mean it.  This is a mess.  Extreme Cougar Wives Sunday.  I've got to be extreme.  Everything's extreme.  Yeah.  Everything's extreme.  Your mic keeps going out today.  Is it the mic?  Yeah.  I thought it was my headphones. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  Something's going on with your mic.  What the fuck?  Let me try this.  Hold on.  Ah, there we go.  That preview clip sucked, by the way.  It was a terrible preview clip.  I know.  I was just watching.  It looks like it would be a good show to check out.  But yeah, there's this other guy that's kind of like this Antonio Banderas guy.  Right.  And he's with this woman that's 90 years old.  And her lips are like.  Of course it's fake.  Oh, she shot up with collagen and stuff.  And she really is 90?  Yeah.  Yeah, of course it's fake. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, I think so.  Jeff Dunham is walking down the hall.  Oh, he's got a big case with his dummy in it.  Oh, maybe he should do the puppet thing today, man.  Oh, yeah?  He's never done the puppet thing on our show.  Oh, stupid puppets.  Come on, let's ask for puppet.  Yeah?  You want to see the puppet?  Jeff Dunham!  There he is.  He's smiling.  Look at Jeff.  He can come right in.  Might as well.  Yo, Jeff Dunham! 
[02:14:30]  Get him a seat.  What?  What happened?  He's just got to make a piddle.  Oh, he's not ready.  You got to whiz.  Take a whiz.  Drop a hot piss.  There's the guy, though.  He's right there.  Where's he?  Go to the bathroom.  Go to the bathroom.  Before he comes down here.  We're going to a little train.  I watched that show, Eric says, and he's got a comment, so we're in filler mode right  now.  Filler mode, as Jeff Dunham takes a pee.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, man.  How you doing? 
[02:15:00]  Good.  This must be like a new season or something, because I caught that show a couple of months  ago, and it's either complete bullshit, or in order to make it real, they'd have to show  them having sex, and then some kind of freak, freaking porno.  I've never seen anything so stupid in my life.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was pretty lame, but it's just watching them kissing and making out.  It's like, uh.  Well, people do anything to get on TV, so.  Yeah.  I realize that.  You put the whole thing together and go, hey, you want to make believe you like old 
[02:15:30]  broads for a while?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then the old broads don't know what they're even doing.  It's perfect.  It's disgusting.  Like you guys said, I mean, either you're in it for the money, or you're gay or something,  and, or you can't get regular women, and you've got to go for it.  Yeah.  It seemed to be like a problem thing.  Would you eat old lady ass, Eric?  God.  Hell no.  Hen.  What do you think old lady ass smells like?  Is it as bad as their feet or breath or scalps? 
[02:16:00]  It's got something to do with the pens.  They're all just dying slowly.  Yeah.  You don't need that.  You don't need any of that shit.  Would an old lady let us smell her ass?  Oh.  Come on.  Let's go old school, guys.  What's the oldest lady we could get in here to bend over and we could smell her ass?  What do you think?  I would not participate.  We've got to go old school.  We've got to start doing this again.  I'll take E-Rock's word for it.  I might even.  When he sniffs it.  You'd make E-Rock do it?  Yes.  Of course.  For the goof, I might.  Go for the smell. 
[02:16:30]  For the goof.  For the goof.  Oh, boy.  Sam, put it on the docket.  We want to smell old ladies' asses.  And by we.  I'm not even joking.  Get a promo and everything.  Okay.  So we're looking for old ladies to volunteer assholes?  Yeah.  Okay.  What's old?  Like 35?  19.  No, we've got to put a, we've got to go at least.  It's got to be at least 60.  No, I've got to go retirement. 
[02:17:00]  65 and older.  65.  Okay.  At least 65 and older.  You know, let's get a promo on the air to get them interested.  I'm thinking a lot of baby powder.  Maybe you could drag in your, you know, your granny from the home.  We used to kidnap people to do bits back in the day.  Yeah.  No, I, I, I'm not going to.  It's a family member bringing her over here.  I would just let he rock do it.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you, Eric.  All right, guys.  Be good. 
[02:17:30]  All right.  Tim in Boston.  Tim.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  All right, Tim.  So, um, I've had the pleasure of working with not two, but three tranny women in my, um,  career.  Right.  Um, none of whom really have had the, uh, have been able to explain why it's offensive,  but I, apparently, um, as a homosexual gentleman myself, um, I could hear it.  You didn't have to tell anybody, sir.  He's got the voice.  The gaydar went off.  He's got the voice.  Instantly. 
[02:18:00]  Very nice.  Um, Jeff Dunham.  Thanks, Tim.  Great phone call.  All right.  See you later.  Be good, Tim.  Call back after.  There you go.  That was a wonderful phone.  No, actually call back, because we want to know your thoughts.  We'd love to hear from you.  That was fascinating.  Jeff, we were talking about, uh, trannies, because we, we're learning today that you can't  say tranny anymore.  Why not?  I don't know.  What?  Jerry Springer got in a little bit of a trouble.  So.  He had to apologize and say, hey, I didn't know.  He had a show called Tranny's Twerking?  Uh, Twerking Tranny. 
[02:18:30]  Uh, Twerking Tranny.  So, the whole show was him saying tranny, and then the LGBT people got mad.  Maybe with a Y and a bunch of you.  That was it.  He was calling him Gearbox.  Yeah.  Uh, I don't know.  Good news.  By the way, this guy could, uh, bring a 62-year-old escort.  So, there you go.  We're also gonna, uh, maybe we shouldn't tell Jeff.  We'll keep doing what we're talking about.  What?  What?  We might start sniffing.  Who's she in the corner?  Is she gonna be offended?  That would be my wife.  Oh, I don't know.  What? 
[02:19:00]  Maybe I'll write it down, then.  Yeah.  It's just a dirty thing we want to do with older and older in her 60s.  We want to.  When is this?  She doesn't have the headphones on, so she won't be able to hear.  We want to sniff old ladies' asses.  Okay.  Okay.  Why?  Why?  Because there's a show on, uh, TLC called, like, Cougar Wise or something.  So, he's curious as to what they smell.  I have zero interest.  I have no interest in this.  When is this gonna happen?  We gotta do 20 hours of radio a week.  We gotta fill up the time.  I have no need or want to do anything.  I didn't want to shake their hands with the fucking jingle of a charm bracelet. 
[02:19:30]  You know when I hear that, I hear them jerked off.  Charm bracelet jingling.  Nothing kills the sexual vibe.  And a charm for each grandkid.  Five little loved heads.  What's happened?  I know, right?  You just walked in for the love of Gad.  Today, I gotta ask you about Bruce Jenner.  Because I did watch the Kardashians a little bit.  And they have a whole storyline that, you know, you guys are like, have a bromance going on. 
[02:20:00]  Or whatever the hell they call it in Hollywood.  People ask me this all the time.  They go, is he turning into a chick?  Is he...  Right, right, right.  No, Bruce Jenner is a friend of mine.  And he is still that guy.  He's still that athlete.  He's still the world's greatest athlete.  He is the most guy's guy.  I mean, he's a really accomplished race car driver.  He's a helicopter pilot.  A fixed wing pilot.  He knows all his stuff.  I don't know if you know how hard it is to fly radio control helicopters, but he's one  of the best pilots out there. 
[02:20:30]  Right.  And all he talks about it, he gets out there and he's constantly doing sporting stuff with  his two daughters from Chris.  Chloe and...  No, no, no.  Kendall and...  Kendall and...  Right, right.  Kylie.  Kylie.  Kylie, yeah.  And it was funny.  There was...  I mean...  So, you know, all that crap.  And I think he wears the earring and does the long hair just to stick his middle finger  up at the world.  You know what?  I can do what I want.  I don't know.  But I...  I don't know.  I don't get the surgery and all that stuff. 
[02:21:00]  But you guys are that close?  Like they showed up?  I don't ask him about stuff.  I go, uh...  But how do you guys meet?  In the hobby store at the stupid radio control helicopter store.  Oh, my God.  You were buying radio control stuff and he was buying fake implant press.  No, you know what?  He said after he ran off that racetrack, after winning the Olympics, he goes, that was  it.  He never ran again.  And he goes, he just...  He never ran again?  No, that's what he says.  He just...  Wow.  He would speak at...  You know, he goes...  He's a motivational speaker.  And, I mean, talk about good advice for kids. 
[02:21:30]  I don't know.  I know.  Some of it went out the window, I guess.  But, um...  No.  It's like, you know, when you get past...  Um...  Oh, and that's the other thing I love.  He says, you know, where he lives now in Malibu, the paparazzi are always waiting for him.  And he thinks it's hilarious because what he'll do is...  And he's, again, an accomplished race car driver.  He knows what he's doing.  So, he'll pull out and he'll jump and he'll lean out the window and he goes, come on, guys.  This is fun.  And these guys are in their little piece of shit, Hondas and that kind of thing. 
[02:22:00]  And they'll just take off going down the 101 and they can't keep up with it.  Wow.  Yeah.  And it's like he just, you know, he flips the middle finger off and goes, come on, assholes.  Here we go.  Wow.  Yeah.  So, you know...  What were you buying in the hobby store?  The same thing?  The helicopter stuff.  Yes.  So, you fly those things too, huh?  Since 1980.  I was in on it from the very beginning.  Wow.  We had a guy in Queens about...  It might be a year now.  Oh, yeah.  He got smashed pretty good.  He took off his own head.  Oh, no.  They're very dangerous.  Are you flying those?  Yeah, yeah.  They've killed, I think this year, four or five people have died from those things. 
[02:22:30]  Those are the ones you guys are flying?  Yeah, yeah.  They're big, dangerous things.  Not the old school ones we used to fly.  These do all sorts of crazy...  You do it.  The 3D stuff.  They're flying lawnmowers.  No, you get hit by one, you're gone.  That's it.  Do you do the 3D stuff?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's insane.  What's the 3D stuff?  You're literally...  Take the helicopter, flinging it around the sky and knowing exactly what you're doing with it.  Yeah, upside down.  It looks amazing.  I mean, just look it up on YouTube.  No, but do you ever get...  I know...  Do you ever get it close to you, like these guys? 
[02:23:00]  There's some guys that are idiots.  I mean, but they're really, really good and they know what they're doing.  I don't...  No, I'm not that good.  Oh, man.  That's scary.  Yeah.  No, it is.  And that's what happened.  That kid, apparently, his dad was there and the whole thing.  It was just like, you know, he got too close to himself and, you know, lost it.  I saw a photo.  They showed that, you know, someone's going to send you a photo.  It was just a giant...  Brutal.  Look, an ax that hit him in the middle of the fire.  Brutal.  It was obviously an instant death.  You got into it before all the electronic devices that keep you nice and stable now and, yeah. 
[02:23:30]  No, it was back in the beginning when, yeah.  But what they're doing now is that the physics are, you know, the power to weight ratio and  all that and the physics that are going into it.  It's like, you see these helicopters doing things that you go, well, this can't happen.  I know.  It's really amazing.  Look it up on YouTube.  It's crazy.  Yeah.  I've seen a few videos.  A lot of videos, yeah.  Are you doing the drones yet?  Oh, yeah.  I got...  It's got a drone.  Is that right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I got one with...  Yeah.  And with the...  What's the camera?  The GoPro.  Yeah, the GoPro.  With the GoPro on it with a gimbal and the whole thing. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah.  And you can pre-program it on your iPad where you hit the waypoints and it'll just fly the  mission.  It just flies itself.  Oh, yeah.  And then if you want it to come back home, you just turn off the transmitter.  It'll fly back and land itself.  It's like...  It lands where it took off from.  Yeah.  I'm telling you, the FAA is going to start to...  Yeah, they're going to have to do something, right?  Yeah.  Because you can just punch it straight up in the sky and go to 3,000 feet and 4,000 feet  and...  What have you done with yours?  Shooting some cool stuff or...  Yeah.  Oh, as a matter of fact, yeah, we've...  I have...  Well, the first time I was really getting good with it, I was playing at the... 
[02:24:30]  Somewhere around here, some kind of...  I don't know.  I'm going to guess...  I'm going to guess...  I'm going to guess...  No, one of the things with more than 4,000 seats in it could be one of those places.  No, it was one...  I think it was Giant Stadium.  You know the tents?  One of the tents, you know, where they have all the shows up in the Northeast.  Gosh darn it.  I can't remember.  What was it?  Yeah, one of...  Yeah.  Oh, the...  That...  Yes.  The fucking...  Melody 10 or something.  No, no.  No, no.  They're...  I can't remember what they are.  What?  They meant like the Melody 10 in Cape Cod. 
[02:25:00]  Like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's been there forever.  So, yeah.  So, one day, I first got it.  I had the camera on it.  I'm flying it around, and nobody's there.  It's before the show.  It's the middle of the day.  This is fantastic.  And, you know, I land it.  I can see...  You can see all the cities, and, you know, it's however high in the sky.  And so, after the show, I went, wait a minute.  I got this come home thing.  So, there's like five crew guys that go, come here, guys.  You've got to see this.  And they all think I'm nuts.  And I have this really nice quadcopter, and I go, watch this.  And so, I just hit...  I punched it straight up in the sky and forward a little bit, and it was a clear night. 
[02:25:30]  There wasn't a moon in the sky.  It was all stars.  And the thing just went out and disappeared.  Oh, shit.  And they're like, are you crazy?  I'm like, no.  Now, watch this.  And I turned off the transmitter and sat down.  And six, seven, eight minutes later, it comes flying back and lands itself.  Right where it took off.  That's really cool.  Are you filming everything, too?  Yeah, and it's all on the GoPro.  Yeah, it's all on the GoPro.  It's like, you're just like...  That's amazing.  Yeah, it's nuts.  So...  Mine took off, and I literally lost it for a while. 
[02:26:00]  Right.  And I'm looking around the sky.  I have the transmitter in my hand.  Now, it's dead silence.  I'm not hearing it and nothing.  I'm like, all right, it's gone.  I don't even know.  So, I turned off the transmitter.  And I'm noticing this little dot in the sky.  It was so tiny, so small as it's coming back.  It had just started running out of battery, too, when it was coming down.  Right.  So, it hit a little hard.  Right.  But totally survived it. 
[02:26:30]  I went inside instantly, took the card out, popped it in my computer to see where it went.  Yeah.  This fucking thing was so high up.  It was...  There were...  And I'm by Kennedy and LaGuardia and whatnot.  There were jets below the helicopter.  You're going to hear someday where it wasn't a...  Yeah.  You're going to hear someday that it wasn't a bird that took out the plane.  Yes.  It was some kids quadcopped.  Sucked through the engine.  Quad.  Under the windshield of the engine or something like that.  But I looked at that.  I was like, oh, that is really high up. 
[02:27:00]  I bet they'll start programming ceilings into them so you can't go above a certain altitude.  Yeah.  But then some will figure it out.  Oh, in a second, you'll be able to just override that one with some gizmo gadget.  That's a good way to do it, though.  You program it so it can't go anyhow.  I was wondering, how would they control that?  That's the simple answer.  Yeah.  They won't let you.  Well, grandfathered in with older equipment now.  Yeah.  So back to Bruce.  So I say leave Bruce alone.  It's like, you know, he's a good guy when you get to know him.  He loves you, according to the Keeping Up With The Kardashians. 
[02:27:30]  That editing is brutal for you, Jeff.  Well, the Kardashian thing, it's all about drama.  All they're trying to do is create drama.  So they take a little bit of fact and just go nuts with it.  So it's a freaking TV show.  You know what I mean?  So I don't know.  What do they have?  Like, do they have longing gazes?  Oh, yeah, all that shit.  I think they actually make a heart at one point.  Like where they edit it, where you're just looking, and it makes it look like you're  looking at him for much too long.  No, no.  I was on one episode. 
[02:28:00]  I was on one freaking episode.  They make it look like you're there every other day.  All reality shows.  And he goes, do you want to be on another episode?  My answer is, I got to see how the fans react to this day.  Yeah, I'm not sure.  You and I are not an item.  What else have you been up to, Jeff?  We haven't seen you in a while.  Yeah, well, I'm going around town promoting Achmed Saves America.  It's going to be on Friday night on CMT.  Nice.  And I took Achmed, the dead terrorist, and we've turned him into animated. 
[02:28:30]  Got one of the guys that wrote on The Simpsons for 10 years.  He and I kind of got an outline of what the story should be.  He then fleshed it out, and it's a fun story.  And this is one of the first things I've ever done that's pretty much for the whole family.  Anybody can watch it.  Wow.  Most of my stuff, you know, it depends on your family if you can watch it.  So, yeah, this is fun, and it's a real pro-American thing.  And Achmed comes to this country and wants to do bad things to small-town USA,  and he ends up, you know, falling in love with all the trappings,  all the stuff that we take for granted, and, like, unlimited buffet, and all that crap. 
[02:29:00]  I don't know if we asked you last time.  Is he well-received in the Middle East?  Well, we're getting ready to do a world tour, and this is a real world tour.  Well, this isn't like going to Australia and calling it a world tour.  This is like a Russell Peters world tour.  Yeah, yeah.  We're starting out in – we started out in Dallas, and we're going to go to the U.K.,  which will include Scotland, Ireland, and England.  Then we're going to head down to South Africa, and then we're going to do – well, Iceland.  I forgot that.  We're doing Iceland.  Jesus.  Then we're doing Dubai.  Then we're doing Tel Aviv, Israel. 
[02:29:30]  And then we're going to go to – what am I – oh, Kuala Lumpur.  Yikes.  Uh-oh.  I don't know what airline we're on, but, you know.  Yeah, yeah, that one.  But apparently if I'm gone, they'll pay five grand.  Yeah.  You heard that this morning, right?  They're going to give each family five grand?  Five thousand bucks.  That's what I saw on my little CNN tweet thing this morning.  The text message was brutal.  We talked about that today.  Oh, that's five thousand dollars.  That's how they –  That's how they formed all their families.  But then we're going to go to Kuala Lumpur.  Then we're going to Singapore.  Then we're going to end it at Pearl Harbor.  So, yeah. 
[02:30:00]  Good for you.  Wow.  So, yeah.  Yeah, Israel.  I hear in Israel they love Ahmed.  I bet –  Of course they do.  Yeah, they'll probably like that.  I think the opening line with Ahmed is going to be, what's with all the Jews?  And you have no problem doing Ahmed in these places.  I don't know.  I haven't done it yet.  Yeah.  But you're going to do it, right?  Yeah.  I mean, yeah.  You know, you're not going to –  I make it a point by saying Ahmed's not Muslim.  We don't know what religion he is.  We don't know really where he's from.  It's Middle East-ish.  Smart.  That's smart.  He is, and we do.  Right.  Smart. 
[02:30:30]  Smart on your part, though.  Yeah, you have to.  Of course.  I like the fact that you at least named him Ahmed, though.  It's like, you know, some people, like, when they talk about, like, bus bombings or whatever,  they'll name the terrorist some politically correct fucking white bread name.  Of course.  Well, Ahmed is not really – Ahmed is Russian.  Ahmed is – would have been correct.  So I actually did that on purpose, too.  I actually didn't notice that.  Damn.  I didn't notice either.  Yeah.  I'm sure no one really noticed this.  No, no one does.  But technically, I think you win, yeah.  I've heard that guys and – businessmen in Iraq sit around and say, 
[02:31:00]  I kill you to each other and laugh.  So I don't know.  Who knows?  Good luck.  Good luck with that.  But we're turning it into a documentary.  The whole point of it, though, is there's a sense of humor translate.  And I found that wherever we go, we all, of course, in the free world, laugh about the same stuff.  We all have the same concerns.  It's, you know, family and friends and job and health.  And so the sense of humor does work if you're joking about the same stuff.  What's interesting, of course, is products don't work.  And you would – I have to – you know, I can't – you can't make jokes about some things they have. 
[02:31:30]  You would think in Ireland that they would have Lucky Charms.  No.  Right.  They had no idea what freaking Lucky Charms are in Ireland.  It's like, what?  How the hell?  Is that real?  Yeah.  How did you know that?  Did you check this stuff first?  Because I did a Lucky Charms joke, and they just sat there and looked at me.  Oh, man.  So you asked after the show and –  Yeah, I go, you guys know Lucky Charms?  He was like, we don't know what that is.  Well, get this breakfast cereal.  Oh, my God.  Wow, man.  Yeah, certain cultural things, right?  So weird.  Like the common stuff does, but it seems like that stuff or like what's in our news, 
[02:32:00]  it's a pop culture relevant they might not get.  Well, see, but they absorb all our entertainment.  I mean, you know, with films and television, you know, Breaking Bad and all those big shows,  they get all that stuff and they love it.  Right.  The Kardashians.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  So they watch all that stuff.  Who knows?  I've never met any of the Kardashians.  No?  No, only the Jenners, which is Khloe and, I mean, gosh darn it, Kylie and Kendall.  Kylie and Kendall.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, and they're all – 
[02:32:30]  Why didn't you meet the Kardashians?  Because that's the other side of the family.  The Jenners are all athletic and, you know, and the others not.  They just sit around on their phones.  Yeah.  Bruce keeps going, come on out to Malibu and we'll go, what do you call it, paddleboarding.  Something.  Yeah, it's like, what?  I don't want to do that.  Yeah, they just sit around, man.  They really do.  There was one episode where they went to Greece and all the Kardashians were – how do you know this?  Oh, he watches them all. 
[02:33:00]  Not all of them.  You do a –  It's not all the time.  Every single one.  I've never seen an episode.  I got five –  I don't love it.  You fucking –  He is the biggest fan.  I try to keep up on pop culture.  Of course, yeah, of course.  I try.  Well, that's –  But the Greece episode, you're right.  The Jenners were, you know, doing all the –  Jump off the boat.  And doing all this shit and the Kardashians sat around on their phones again.  Yeah.  Although the fat one jumped off the boat.  Oh.  That was impressive.  I couldn't tell you one thing that's going on on the show. 
[02:33:30]  They jumped off the boat, finally.  But they made it a big deal.  And I don't understand why people even watch these girls just sitting around.  Okay.  We were –  I hate talking about this, but we were invited to the Christmas party, you know.  And it's like my daughters were like, what?  I said, yeah, Bruce invited us, so let's go.  So I didn't know what to expect.  And it's like –  It's just surreal because you see all this stuff on TV.  And I know Bruce.  I know his –  You know, the Jenners.  But we walked in, and there were the rest of them.  And there's freaking Kanye standing there shaking hands. 
[02:34:00]  And I'm like, what?  Really?  You know, like two black people in the whole party, and he was two of them.  And he was two of them.  So, I mean, and he was – everybody was as nice as they could be.  Everybody was charming.  The place was beautiful.  It's like, all right, I get it.  But all these rich people everywhere, I'm like, why am I – you know, I –  There's rich, and then there's Hollywood rich.  Then there's – I've got to show how rich I am.  Yeah.  And I'm like – we felt – I felt really out of place there. 
[02:34:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  I was just out of place.  I've crunched the numbers.  No, no, no.  You're doing well.  I was way out of place.  You're doing well.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  Pickup truck, for God's sake.  All right.  So, yeah.  So, it was just odd but fascinating, and everybody was as charming as could be.  So, I got nothing bad to say about.  I'm just amazed people watch the show.  Like, I don't even understand –  I don't care why the numbers are so high.  What the attraction is to watching –  I don't know.  Nothing really ever happens. 
[02:35:00]  I don't hate them or like them.  Right.  I just don't have any opinion.  Well, to be on the front of Vogue magazine, I'm scratching my head on that one.  Yeah, yeah.  So, I don't get that.  I don't get that in my game, Kim.  How did that happen?  What did they do to get on the front of Vogue?  I don't know.  They talked to somebody.  Yeah, they got good people, I guess.  Well, the magazine business is pretty desperate, so.  Yeah, it's deep shit.  They know that's going to sell a lot of copies.  Well, that was a joke I did this morning.  It was on – whatever I was on.  Second class. 
[02:35:30]  Fox and Trends, yeah.  Oh, I didn't do the joke.  Where else did I do it?  I don't know where I did it.  Oh, no, I did do it.  I don't remember.  Anyway, too much press.  What was the joke?  Was that – give the – what was it?  Give the photographer some – oh, wait.  I got it right here.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  No, it's a good joke.  You're putting a lot of pressure on this one.  Oh, man.  Better be a good joke.  Hold on.  Ready?  Pressure amounts.  Hold on.  This is a good one.  Did you see Kanye and Kim were on the cover of Vogue magazine?  Some folks are upset, but I thought it was nice to see at least one photographer who didn't 
[02:36:00]  get his ass kicked by Kanye for snapping a photo.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  All right.  I can accept that.  It's topical.  I can accept that.  Hey, are you still making stuff in your 3D printer?  I kind of reference you every time that comes up because you and Len are the only two people  I know that actually have 3D printers.  Yeah, well, they're getting cheap now and the technology's going crazy.  But yeah, I got a friend who's the director of the new Smurf movie, but it's a total redo. 
[02:36:30]  They're not going back to the animated horrible thing with live action and animated.  This is a total remake.  They're going back to the 50s, the real Smurfs.  But it's a Sony picture and it's not a multi-billion dollar thing, but he said it's in 3D.  And I go, do you have the characters in 3D yet?  And he says, well, yeah.  And I go, give me the files.  So I printed him a whole set of Smurfs.  And all the people that are making the movie went nuts because it's all on computers. 
[02:37:00]  Right, right.  They're all about a foot tall and all the sets.  So it's like, yeah, it's crazy what you can do.  You printed out your own Smurfs on your 3D printer?  Yeah, because, you know, if it's in 3D.  He's rich.  No, no, it's like.  Only rich guys can do that.  You can get a 3D printer for like 800 bucks now.  Is that the best thing you've printed out so far?  No, no, no.  Some of the crazy stuff, some of the files that the printer company comes up with. 
[02:37:30]  A bicycle chain?  Wow.  It's like, how does that happen?  And there's no Master Link on it.  So, you know what I mean?  Right, right, right.  So it's just to get, and it's printed all together.  Yeah.  Done, finished.  Yeah, because.  It's so weird that it can move.  What's the material?  The material, this one, this is the lower end of the high-end machines, but most of them  print in like ABS plastic.  So the file, when you say they give you the file, what kind of specs are on the file? 
[02:38:00]  Like, it's obviously not just a photo of it.  What exactly is it telling you?  It's just a three-dimensional file, you know.  Oh, it's just a photo?  So, no, like a three, like, you know, when you see on TV when they drag the thing around  and it's in three dimensions.  Yeah, that's all it is.  So when you get the printer, they give you a whole bunch of things you can print out.  Just a handful of things.  Just to start your hobby.  Yeah, just to make sure the printer's working.  No, it becomes, yeah, oh, yeah, there's those files.  A buddy of mine said, I got the file for the gun.  I'm like, don't put it on my computer.  Don't give it to me.  I don't want it.  Why?  Wouldn't you want to print it out just to see what it does? 
[02:38:30]  I'm not being serious.  Well, I think when they find it on your computer.  Right.  Is it officially illegal to do that?  I don't know.  I think in some states.  Yeah, probably.  How big is the printer physically?  And again, that's, you know, you get what you pay for.  So the printing area is a big thing.  Like the hobby printers will do like three by four by six inches.  They're tiny.  You know, so, but I don't know if it's that small.  But this one is a fairly big one.  And it has printing area of 10 by 10 by 12 inches. 
[02:39:00]  So you can print something pretty big.  How do you load that material in there?  It comes on a spool.  This particular one comes on a spool.  It's like really, like a really thick fishing line.  I don't know.  It's like, what, 16th of an inch thick.  So it's just a big spool.  And so it feeds it into it.  And it melts it at 500 and something degrees.  And then it just spreads it out like frosting.  Oh, my God.  At 10,000th of an inch thick.  Do I have anything I made here?  I don't think I do.  It's like, yeah.  And how long does a spool last you, say?  Like when you made those smurfs, how many could you make with one spool? 
[02:39:30]  Like one spool will do a solid block nine by nine by nine.  But when you print something, you don't ever do it solid.  Mm-hmm.  So when you have an object, it prints like a grid inside just for support.  Okay.  So you can do it a really heavy grid or a not heavy.  How much does a spool cost?  250 bucks.  But you can mill a lot of stuff.  Like if you wanted to make this coffee cup.  Hey, is that mine?  That's mine.  Thanks.  If you wanted to make this coffee cup, you know, with a wall thickness of, what, a sixteenth of an inch, that'd be like two inches of material. 
[02:40:00]  And then one spool is 53 inches, which is nine by nine by nine.  But how do you program it?  That's so cool.  That's the amazing part is let's say you want to do that water bottle.  Yeah.  Okay.  How easy is it?  So the question is, are you going to scan it with a 3D scanner?  Right.  And then you'll have that file, or are you going to build it in CAD on the computer?  Oh, wow.  So it's better to build it in CAD on the computer, because then the angles are perfect, everything's exact.  But if you have a 3D scanner, you can get pretty darn close. 
[02:40:30]  So you scan it, you have that file now.  It's an STL file.  So then you take this file and put it in your laptop, and then the software figures out what the tool pathway is going to be for all that.  You know what I mean?  I love it.  That's amazing.  How's it going to actually build the thing?  Yeah.  Wow.  And then it just builds it a layer at a time, a ten thousandths of an inch thick at a time.  And the better printers do really thin, thin, thin layers that you can't even see the layers, but then you can imagine how long it would take to print something.  Yeah, yeah.  It's all like resolution. 
[02:41:00]  Right.  It's all the same thing as a regular printer on paper.  Right.  The higher the resolution.  The more detail you get, the higher resolution, the longer it takes to print, but the better it's going to look.  That's right.  You're not going to get those ridges on there.  Right.  And there's some guys in Germany who came out with a printer now that'll print like a table.  It's got a platform like four feet by four feet by three feet.  But the trouble is, if you're not going to be there forever, the layers are pretty thick.  Yeah, so it looks almost like aliasing.  You need that anti-aliasing like you would a regular printer.  Right. 
[02:41:30]  Well, it's layers, so it actually looks like wood.  It looks like the grain of wood.  That's hilarious.  I'm surprised you don't have one, Ant.  I know, right?  I'm telling you, some of these now you can get, and again, the quality of material won't be as good.  The resolution won't be as good.  You get what you pay for.  So you can spend a quarter of a million dollars on one.  Is that the high-end high-end or no?  Yeah, and it'll print in titanium.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  So you can build your own tools.  Yeah.  But the low end of the high-end is like what?  The low end of the high-end, which I have, is like 35 grand. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, okay.  But those are coming down.  That was three years ago.  That's still, that's less than you think it would be for something such an amazing piece of technology.  Well, what I've used it for, like we've built props for my specials, and it paid for itself in no time.  Because to pay somebody in Hollywood to build a whatever, you'd pay twice that.  Right.  Wow.  Yeah.  $2.50 and you can build out of titanium.  That's crazy.  But I have nothing to build out of titanium.  I would literally just be making like dildos and giving them to girls here.  Club somebody with this. 
[02:42:30]  Or scan your own.  Oh, yeah, exactly.  With Lieutenant Dan's legs.  Yeah, yeah.  Titanium.  Yeah, titanium, like the space shuttle.  I got a call from Syracuse about you.  Doug in Syracuse.  We got Jeff Dunham in studio.  Go ahead.  Hi, guys.  Big fan of all of you.  Thank you.  I was in Saudi Arabia last year.  I was just passing through on a business thing.  And fun fact, Jeff, you are the number one American comedian in Saudi Arabia because of Ahmed, the dead terrorist. 
[02:43:00]  Wow.  Number one on what list?  I was there.  I was in the airport lounge, and it just came up.  You are huge.  They love Ahmed.  The catchphrase, the I kill you.  It's epic.  They love it.  And it just came up.  So punch it out.  Just FYI.  Thanks, man.  I appreciate that.  Did you know right away that Ahmed was going to be a massive hit?  No, and I told this on Fox this morning, whatever their live cast is. 
[02:43:30]  I didn't do it on the air.  But a year after 9-11, Leno and Letterman were at least joking.  Nothing funny about 9-11, but they were joking about those guys and Osama bin Laden.  We hadn't found him.  Where the hell is he?  And I sat there, and I thought, I know where he is.  Because he's actually killed sort of dead, and he's been hiding in the suitcase with all my characters.  So I built the dead Osama. 
[02:44:00]  That was the first iteration.  But I thought, if I'm going to do this, I'm going to make sure I'm going to do it right.  So when I wrote the material, I imagined if there were relatives of victims in that room, what would they be okay with?  What could I joke about?  What could I talk about?  And what would they think was funny?  So I wrote that material, and then I thought, I can't chicken out.  I'm going to do this where it counts.  So the first show I did was six miles from Ground Zero in Bananas Comedy Club, wherever it was.  And it was awesome.  It was great.  And it went over really well, because when I pulled him out, you know, this stupid-looking skeleton, Osama, and everybody laughed. 
[02:44:30]  So the material went great.  And so then I used him for a couple years, and then after that, we were going to do another special.  And I thought, I'm going to pull that guy back out.  But what if we catch Osama?  Then it'll be dated.  I don't want it to be dated.  So I just turned him into a general terrorist that we don't know where he's from.  I don't know where he's from, and he's non-Muslim.  Yeah, it's funny.  Exactly.  That's very smart.  Oh, wow.  That's by far your number one character.  What's number two, you think?  I'm obsessed with number two all the time. 
[02:45:00]  Of course you are.  He makes the little things come in.  His butt's a 3D printer.  That's nice.  Because we all know the number one of things.  I'm always obsessed with that, the one that is just short.  It's a member of the IRA.  If you go by merchandise, Peanut is actually, is Peanut outselling Achmed now?  Yeah, I think so, as far as the dolls go.  The dolls, the stalls are something we sell after the shows, yeah.  So Peanut is actually outselling.  Do you sell dolls at the shows?  Oh, yeah, of course.  Wow. 
[02:45:30]  Of course.  That's great.  Yeah, the animatronic ones where you push the button and they talk and all that stuff,  yeah.  So Peanut actually outsells.  I think it's because of women.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're a fucking empire.  You're not an empire in comedy.  Smart.  Oh, my God.  It really is.  Well, we're really hoping for big numbers on Friday night because if this animated thing  takes off, that would be really fun.  Add another part to the empire.  Yeah, but it's not easy because most people don't realize how long. 
[02:46:00]  You know, a good Disney film, eight years.  That's how long it takes.  How does it take eight years?  But it takes six to eight years to do a good Disney film.  Put mouse ears on the thing.  Fucking go ahead.  Talk.  But obviously, you know.  But obviously, what we're doing is not a Disney thing, you know.  So we did it in a year and a half.  And, you know, it's TV animation, so it's a lot, you know, high resolution and all that  stuff.  But, no, it'd be fun.  It's a fun world to delve in.  I mean, Greinig, Matt Greinig, holy moly. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  Simpsons has been on 25 years now.  Something like that.  It might even be longer at this point.  Yeah.  So.  Jesus.  So what is it?  Gunsmoke?  How long was Gunsmoke on?  Yeah, yeah.  I think that's still the number one.  Yeah.  Matt Dillon.  Gunsmoke.  You watched that?  Well, I remember when I was a kid coming on.  I don't think I quite got it.  But I remember it coming on too.  Your dad would watch it?  Yeah, my mother and father.  They used to like to fuck to it.  Jesus.  That's nice.  Thank God.  Well, it was either that. 
[02:47:00]  I was picturing the Nortons sitting there watching Gunsmoke.  Better not than good times.  Only when Miss Kitty came on.  Can I ask about your watch?  Is that the new...  Oh, that's a pebble.  Oh, that's...  What is that?  That's had nothing to do with the new phones?  Yeah, but it's connected to the iPhone, so you can pick any...  But this is one of those kickstart programs.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, and they're doing really, really well, except when the iWatch comes out, the Apple  one, I think the...  Well, the Samsung one's out too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're getting those today, I think.  Yeah, what does that do?  What exactly does it do to...  Well, you can pick any face you want. 
[02:47:30]  You can pick apps for it.  It's, you know, this one, I like the time and the temperature and, you know, but...  Oh, you can go to...  Wait, there's Mickey Mouse.  But how do you type...  Oh, just different watch faces, but how do you type into it or can you do anything...  Well, it gets all your phone messages and all your texts and all that, but you can't  type into it.  So instead of, like, you know, pulling out your phone, you just go, oh, I got a text.  All right, there it is.  I don't have to pay attention to that one.  Or do I need to answer this phone call or not?  Right, right, right.  No.  I don't see it taking off.  I don't know if that does...  I know we'll play this audio back and...  Oh, it'll be huge. 
[02:48:00]  You think watch is really going to take off?  I think they will.  I think because of what Apple's doing with all...  It'll do everything.  I think it's going to be another...  Unless they've totally dropped the ball.  Well, what's the problem with taking your phone out?  The fact that you have to take your phone out.  I guess.  Because the watch is such a piece of...  Because people have nice watches.  I never liked watches, though.  No, but I'm saying, like, you know, if you wear, like, a $3,000 watch or...  Like, that's not going to replace a Rolex.  Will that technology catch on?  Because you're competing with things that are such a fashion piece.  I'm talking a lot.  People don't really wear watches.  Like, my kids don't wear watches ever. 
[02:48:30]  I was just going to say that.  People don't wear watches anymore because you got your phone.  That's a good point.  You know, it's right there.  Of course.  As long as it booms.  So they're trying to bring back the watch, basically.  That's true.  But what Apple's always done, at least when Steve Jobs was around, is they created a  niche that you didn't realize you needed.  Right.  So, you know, if somebody...  I don't know.  I think it's going to be big.  I think it's pretty cool, yeah.  My TV earrings are going to flop.  I have earrings that show popular TV programs on them.  What a horrid idea.  Yeah, you have to stand in front of two mirrors to get the angle.  Oh, and the sound goes right into your ear. 
[02:49:00]  What was the thing you ride on?  The, um...  Cock?  Yeah, that one, too.  I don't know.  No, the, uh...  Hilarious.  Gosh darn it.  What's that thing called?  You stand on, you ride it.  Oh, the Segway.  Oh, the Segway.  Remember that?  Like, two years before it was coming out, everybody said, nobody knew what it was.  It's going to change the world.  Right.  And, yeah, I...  It's been a boss for the most part.  It became a fun little novelty for a little while.  Yeah, that's right.  And I was at a...  Wherever we were doing a show, and they had two of them there.  And the cops had them.  And I'm like, can we ride these? 
[02:49:30]  And they're like, yeah, go ahead.  So it was before the show, and it was a, I don't know, some kind of arena place where  we could ride round and round and round on the outside where people walked.  And I'm like, we've got to get these.  These are great.  Me and the opening act, we're riding everywhere.  And after 10 minutes, I'm like, okay.  All right, back to the...  Yeah, it's like, I can't jump anything.  Yeah, 10, 12 minutes.  You can't jump anything, exactly.  It's like, what are we doing with this?  I'll get a motorcycle.  Yeah, you're not...  You're just standing there, moving fast.  It's good if you need it, like, for work, like, at a mall or whatever.  But if you don't need it, as a leisure activity, I guess it runs thin. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, when you see a cop going through an airport on one, you're like, you lazy bastard.  Yeah, yeah.  Walk a beat.  Walk a beat.  How much prep is there for you?  When you're doing, like, corporate gigs, I'm sure you do a good amount.  I'm like, you must have a lot of setup and, like, mic test and all that stuff.  It's got to be a...  Nah, it's one box and two trunks and some dummies and one microphone on a stand.  No, I pride myself in making it really, really easy.  You know, because you look at, you know, somebody like Seinfeld or somebody, they just walk in, 
[02:50:30]  talk, and then leave.  And that's the beauty of stand-up.  So I have crap.  But then you look at, like, a magician, you're like, well, I don't have crap.  I have a box.  Yeah, legendary Wid who's got a fucking...  You know Wid?  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  He literally would have a van full of stuff.  Which Wid?  He was a guy who worked at a Philly.  He was very, very funny.  Take Carrot Top and then add a hoarder.  Yes.  And alcoholism.  And a hoarder and William Holden's liver. 
[02:51:00]  He was really funny, the Wid, man.  But how much stuff did he actually have?  I would say four or five giant, like, refrigerator box size stuff.  Really?  And by the time he was done, the entire stage was covered in crap.  He's stepping on his own props.  He just throws them.  Yeah, it was a disaster area.  Oh, wow.  But you couldn't help it.  It's like watching a car wreck.  It's like, this is like, I got to see this.  Yeah, and he would just kind of antagonize the audience.  Was he funny?  Yeah, comedians actually liked him a lot.  Yeah.  They give a lot of shit to those guys, but if you're funny, you're funny. 
[02:51:30]  Is he still around?  You know, he is, but he works at a Philly, and I haven't seen him in a long time.  But people passing through will pass a message here and there.  In 1989, he and I were on the Jonathan Winner's Traveling Roadshow special on Showtime or something.  Wow.  Wow.  25 years ago.  Taped in Encino, California at a crap club that's now a pet supply place. 
[02:52:00]  I used to love those shows in the 80s, all the different comedy shows that were on television.  There were so many of them.  Yeah, it was when you could set up a microphone and a stage, and you had a comedy club.  Yeah.  And then the comedy shows became the same thing.  Yeah.  And Judy, you booked a bunch of those, right?  Yes, I did.  Yeah, Judy, my manager, booked a lot of the talent.  So if you didn't get on one of those, it's her fault.  I don't think I ever tried it.  The first one I ever tried for Hank Gallo, a guy named Hank Gallo got me.  It might have been the Louis Anderson show, I think. 
[02:52:30]  No, Friday Night Videos was my first one.  Oh, was I atrocious.  Was that bad?  Oh, I was such a little douche.  Was that the one you were like, hey, everybody.  Yeah, how you doing?  Oh, he was in Conan's studio.  He had a funny voice.  Yeah, it was a fucking like me character.  Well, you didn't get hit on by Louis Anderson.  No, I didn't.  Damn.  Did you really?  Was he a good flirt at least?  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  I got it.  It was like, at that time, I was like, I'm going to get married.  I got to do something because I understand.  I got the dolls, you know.  I get it. 
[02:53:00]  But it was, yeah, it was awful.  Yeah.  How did he hit on you?  It must have been uncomfortable.  Yeah, just an uncomfortable thing.  Did he rub your leg?  No, no.  Comedy advice?  No, it didn't get that far.  But it was, yeah, there were a couple of hints.  I'm like, hey, you know, I got to go.  What was your first TV show?  First TV show?  Oh, Lord.  That was campus comedy in 1983 or 84 with Joe Piscopo as the host on HBO. 
[02:53:30]  How did it go?  I was still in college, and I was completely clean.  I wouldn't say damn.  And I was the only person on the show that was clean.  And it was great.  I mean, for that time, you know, I was, how old was I?  I don't know.  It was 1983.  Did Joe try to kiss you?  I was 21.  Now, he was okay.  You know, Joe Piscopo.  We like Joe.  Who else was on that show?  Anybody we would know?  Oh, boy.  Nobody that lasted.  Oh, wait.  One guy. 
[02:54:00]  I can't remember his name.  Yep.  One guy that went on to write, but he was the only guy.  Everybody else, they were all college acts.  Yeah, yeah.  Isn't it weird when you watch those old specials and you see the guys that were, like, most  of them went somewhere, but when you see a lot of them, like, you know, you know, and  Roseanne Barr, um, Rich Peters.  Yeah, you're like, what happened to Rich Peters?  I'm obsessed with what happened to guys from the 80s.  Did you go to, like, the Punchline, Atlanta, or wherever?  Because someone thought they were the shit.  They were on those pictures on the walls.  Yes.  They were on that show. 
[02:54:30]  Well, just the headshots.  Like, where are they?  Right.  Oh, yeah.  You go to the Punchline in Atlanta.  And I don't know if their walls are still the same there, but all those photos from way back when  Denunzio used to run that club.  And it's, oh, my gosh, what happened to all these people?  Surely Hempel, like all those old school acts.  Yeah, yeah.  They're still there.  And then it's great to talk to somebody like Judy or my other manager, Robert Hartman, who's  been in the business for years and go, whatever happened to, and then hear the horrible story.  And you get an answer, right?  Yeah.  It's a horrible story.  Yeah, there was one guy that was a big, big headliner act, and I was walking through 
[02:55:00]  Home Depot with my daughter.  Oh, no.  And, sir, can I help you?  And I went, I recognize that voice.  And I turned around and was like, oh.  I used to be the middle act, and he was the headliner.  No way.  Oh, man.  Was he nice to you at least?  Oh, yeah.  And he recognized me.  You could tell.  He was just humbled.  And it was like, hey, I'm trying to get back into it.  And I'm like, man, that's great.  But, you know, how's everything else?  Yeah.  Wow.  Let me get back into it here.  Yeah.  I'm just trying to buy some hammers for my mansion. 
[02:55:30]  Could you show me where they are?  Because my rolls crushed my hammer handle.  That's so wrong.  Do you know what happened, though?  If he's a headliner, how does it go wrong?  It seems if you get to that point, you're all right.  You could coast for many years.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know what.  You know, a lot of these guys you hear about go to their heads, and it just,  they start becoming demanding, and then nobody wants to work with them anymore,  and the clubs go, it's not worth it.  The 80s headliners, it seems like a lot of them who weren't good, 
[02:56:00]  like when 1990 around there came, and that big boom of the 80s was over,  and bottlenecked, it seems like that squeezed a lot.  Because I came in 1990, so I heard about the glory days, but I never.  That was the same with me.  I never was around for all that in the 80s.  Like when Seinfeld and Letterman and all those guys were still doing clubs.  Yeah, so I don't know.  Yeah, because when the bottom finally fell out of that, a lot of those guys.  A lot of those clubs went away.  It was so hard to fill up all those shows that were on Showtime, HBO, 
[02:56:30]  just all the network channels on Friday night and stuff had comedy clubs there on the screens.  And then what happens?  Where do you go?  Well, it was cheap programming, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  It took nothing to put it on reality now.  But yeah, so anybody could have a show on TV.  And what was the one on Fox?  Comic Strip Live.  Comic Strip Live.  Did John Mulroney host that or no?  A couple people host it, but John did it for a while. 
[02:57:00]  Who else did it?  I don't know.  But originally it was at Igby's.  Do you remember Igby's?  I remember the name.  I don't think I ever did it.  Yeah, Igby's Comedy Club.  And then it went to the where?  It was the Laugh Factory.  To the Laugh Factory.  Yeah, right.  But that was great.  And you know what I remember most about that show?  After you were on that show, they give you the most awesome whatever parting gift.  What was it?  Really?  Yeah.  I remember they gave you a television once, a little tiny television.  Come on, really?  Oh yeah, it was like Fox is awesome.  This is when Fox was just starting to become, you know, pretty important. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I remember when I was in Waco, Texas going to college and I went to when Fox was first starting  and I walked in and I was going to be on the news or something and they had a big poster  in the lobby that said, Mutant Ninja Turtles.  And I looked at that and I went, oh, that is never going to work.  Oh, whoops.  Do you know, I swear to you, I thought the same thing.  I remember I was on 10th Avenue driving north and I looked at a movie poster, Titanic the  movie, and fucking dummy, I said, well, that's going to bomb. 
[02:58:00]  I thought that was going to be an absolute bomb.  I realized I've never been there.  I got an older one.  I was at a mall, the mall in Waco, Texas, whatever mall it was, and this place called Blockbuster  opened.  And they were renting VHSs for a dollar and I'm like, they are never going to have any  money in that.  Well, the people that made worse decisions in Waco don't feel bad.  Oh, yeah.  The Branch Davidians, I swear.  David Koresh, I swear I did a show at the compound once.  Not really.  Not really, but. 
[02:58:30]  I have one of those, I screwed up and had no foresight for a show.  It is.  It was a bus board when I first got it, when we first came back to New York.  And it said, if one family doesn't kill them, the other one will.  And I just went, ugh, that show is going to flop.  And it was The Sopranos.  Oh, well.  Whoops.  Oopsie.  That was kind of a big one.  Yeah, yeah.  My business manager, many years ago, he goes, so Apple is coming out with this thing called 
[02:59:00]  the iPod.  He goes, I got 10 grand.  Should I invest?  And I went, John, if I had an extra 10 grand, I would do that in a heartbeat.  And I said, I can't do that now.  And I think that stock has split two or three times now.  Yeah.  And he doesn't even talk to me about how much it went to.  But that was my only good financial advice to anybody else. 
[02:59:30]  What do you think that $10,000 is worth now?  Oh, please.  How much did it cost back then?  I mean, before the iPod.  I don't know what their stock was in 19...  I don't know what that was.  It's safe to say hundreds of thousands.  I have Apple stock.  Lieutenant Dan bought me some.  Thank God.  Invested me in Apple.  Were you eventually because you started, or you always did that?  Yeah, I know.  I started when I was eight years old and got the dummies and started doing shows.  And so by the time I reached college age, I was doing shows all over the place.  And then during the summers or during the weekends when people would go to college football games, 
[03:00:00]  I'd fly out to L.A. and do shows or try and do clubs.  So by the time I moved to L.A. in 88, I already knew how to entertain.  It wasn't until I started doing clubs in L.A. that I realized I can't be a variety act.  I can't be clever.  I have to tell jokes and be funny.  So then I just basically turned my act into what I thought would...  I consider now a stand-up act that happens to use ventriloquism as a comedy.  What happened to Taylor?  I only worked with him one time, and I remember he won... 
[03:00:30]  Taylor Mason?  Yes.  Didn't he win some big show or something?  Yeah, he won...  America's Funniest People or America's Not Talent?  No, the other one.  No.  Ed McMahon.  Oh, Star Search.  Star Search, right?  Yeah, he does a lot of that.  Three and a half stars!  Church what?  Church event.  Church event.  Oh, he's a religious guy?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, he's still working.  He's a funny guy, and he's an entertainer.  He does a lot of music and all that stuff.  That's what made me think of him.  I remember he had a bunch of puppets on a few puppets at once on a stick, like a couple 
[03:01:00]  of...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I forget how he did it.  But it was pretty...  It's not my style.  He was very clean.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  But beyond clean.  Like you said, churchy, religious.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not really good with that.  Was your first dummy one of those knucklehead smith or something?  Yeah, you know, and the company was called Juro Novelty Company, and they had ventriloquist  dummies starting back in the...  I think the late 50s, early 60s, where they started making Jerry Mahoney's. 
[03:01:30]  Jerry Mahoney dolls, yeah.  And then Danny O'Day, and then Charlie McCarthy and Mortimer Snurred.  They were just these vinyl...  Why were they all Irish?  Yeah, that's a good point.  That's so weird.  I think it started with Charlie McCarthy, and then the other guy's kind of naked after.  Yeah.  But the vinyl head, the doll body, the string in the back of the neck.  So that company was bought out by a company named Goldberger.  Goldberger Dolls still makes ventriloquist dummies, and they sell them all over the world,  and they're still...  Wow.  And sales in the last few years have been booming, and the world has gone full circle. 
[03:02:00]  My first dummy was a Juro Mortimer Snurred, and now we're actually...  And there, that's the last thing I printed on my 3D printer.  They want to make an Achmed and sell the little inexpensive talking Achmed.  Oh, man.  So I've been printing out the correct size Achmed head that I'm about to send to them  that they're going to turn into the talking Achmed.  The little boys everywhere will be able to start their ventriloquism career.  Well, he says, I thought, you know, what parents are going to buy this? 
[03:02:30]  And the guy goes, no, this is the request we get all the time for Achmed.  I'm like, really?  He goes, yeah, he goes, and Slappy from, oh, what's that kid's scary books?  Come on.  It's not coming to me.  What is it?  Goosebumps.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, there's a ventriloquist dummy on their name.  I think it's Slappy.  Slappy?  But a really scary ventriloquist dummy.  He goes, that's our number one selling dummy, the scary ventriloquist dummy.  I'm like, all right, well, we'll get Achmed, the dead terrorist. 
[03:03:00]  What a great Christmas present.  What made you pick Mortimer Schnurd as the first one?  I don't know.  I saw what I saw in the toy store and said, Mom, I like this.  And it showed up.  Yep.  I don't know.  What's your favorite ventriloquist movie?  I always am fascinated.  Oh, yeah.  I always paint the ventriloquist as, like, the psychotic guy.  Well, what else are you going to do?  Yeah, that's true.  I mean, give it a love story.  I mean...  No, it would be great if the ventriloquist was like a real piece of shit, like, you know,  sodomite, and the puppet was actually nice and settled and bound.  Like... 
[03:03:30]  Anthony Hopkins.  In Magic.  Wow.  Yeah, that was a fun one.  Anne Margaret and Burgess Meredith.  Yeah.  That movie came out in 1978 or 79, and the story arc was he was, you know, a magician,  and he wasn't getting anywhere with that, and then he started with the...  Then he got the ventriloquism, got the dummy, started doing ventriloquism.  Then he started doing comedy clubs, and he got really good in the comedy clubs.  He got an agent.  The agent moved him out to L.A.  He got on The Tonight Show.  He started doing a bunch of talk shows.  My career took that exact same arc up until the point he offed his William Morris agent 
[03:04:00]  with a dummy.  So I have not done that yet.  Fats, right?  Fats was the dummy.  Fats, right?  Fats was the dummy.  Fats, right?  Fats was the dummy.  Fats, right.  And Corky was Anthony Hopkins.  Now, did they actually film him?  Did Carson actually use The Tonight Show set or just imply that he was on The Tonight Show?  No, I think it was just Burgess Meredith was his agent and said, okay, then you gotta do Carson.  Oh, he just kind of talked about it.  It was a low-budget film.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:04:30]  I still remember when I was a kid, though, I wish we had somebody here on the computer  because the ad for Magic, which we played before.  Abracadabra, I sit on his knee, presto chango, and now he is me.  Yeah!  Pocus Pocus, we take her to bed, magic is fun, we're dead.  Yeah, that was such a great, and then the old voiceover, Anthony Hopkins.  Yeah, but the dummy would do that.  It's creepy Jeff Dunham knows that, by the way.  Well, he was like, Abracadabra, I sit on his knee.  You know, it's like that kind of voice in the dummy.  I think it's gotta be on YouTube somewhere. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, yeah, we've played it.  Sure.  Yeah, it's scary.  Let's get Jeff out of here, he's a busy man.  We're done for the day, Jesus.  I think so, yeah.  You should get a plug-in just in case, Jimmy.  In case, Jimmy.  Yes.  Well, Jeff will do his, he's, Akhmet Saves America.  It's on CMT this Friday, that's the 28th.  It's at 10 o'clock and 9 o'clock Central Standard Time.  Out, not on DVD.  What is that?  Not on DVD?  What is that?  I don't know.  Out now on DVD. 
[03:05:30]  Out now on DVD.  What, the same thing?  The animation?  Yeah, but don't pay any attention to the DVD and Blu-ray, don't buy it.  Just watch it on Friday night.  We want big numbers.  You need the numbers.  Let's get Jeff Dunham some numbers this Friday night.  Go to JeffDunham.com on Twitter.  CMT, and again, 10 o'clock, it's a lot of fun, and we want to drive the numbers because  I'd love for this thing to go beyond one episode.  Cool, very cool.  Yeah.  And myself, to prepare for my world tour, I'm doing the Tampa Sidesplitters, April 
[03:06:00]  11th and 12th.  Wait, let me have this.  Let me have this.  I'm doing this promo here.  Oh, nice.  So, Jim Norton, this is what's going to happen with Jim.  He's going to Tampa on Thursday, April 10th at the Cowhead Roast and the Teppan Center.  Yeah.  It's a big night in show business.  Wait, what's the Cowhead Roast?  Well, he's a guy, he's a radio guy in Tampa who's changing his name.  So they're not roasting him on TV.  I think they're doing it on dat tape and emailing it to friends.  So this is the Teppan Roast.  What's the Teppan Roast?  Teppan's a place, I think. 
[03:06:30]  It says Teppapin.  Teppapin.  Whoever wrote this up is a fucking moron.  April 11th and 12th is the only one I care, but that's the gig itself.  Well, what's Thursday, April 10th?  It's a roast I'm doing.  For Cowhead.  For Cowhead.  Who's Cowhead?  You don't know.  No one really knows.  Okay.  So at the Teppan Center.  Yes.  But you don't care about that?  No.  Okay.  So the most important thing for Jim is Friday and Saturday, April 11th and 12th at Sidesplitters  Comedy Club.  Yeah.  And for tickets you go to sidesplitterscomedy.com.  Or as this says, .corn. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  .corn.  Yeah.  That's the printer, I think.  Hold on.  Then April 24th through 27th is the whole time.  Thursday through Sunday.  Oh, at Caroline's.  Yes.  Well, that is fantastic.  In New York City.  Again, you can go to ticketweb.com or carolines.com.  Congratulations on Caroline's.  That's one place I never did well.  Oh, wow.  It's performance wise or I'm sure you drew there.  I only played there once and did not do well.  Do you mean your shows? 
[03:07:30]  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I think it was way before anything.  I never did well in the city until things got better for me.  Because it was like, you know, in that song, New York, New York.  If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere.  That drove me crazy for 15 years.  Because I always sucked in the city.  Always.  I can't make it anywhere.  I would die every time I did a show in New York.  Be it, you know, whatever.  Why?  I don't get that.  Because I was the middle of the country.  I was not cutting edge.  You know what I mean?  And so, congratulations to Caroline, Jim. 
[03:08:00]  I bet you do well there.  Thanks.  Oh, well, I mean, the shows, the crowd seems to enjoy it.  Them's that come.  But, you know.  Oh, Jimmy.  I'm there 24th through 27th.  24th through the 27th of April.  I'm going.  I bet you Caroline's is regretting that dash.  They're like, well, we should have just given him two nights.  He could have done the Thursday, Sunday.  That dash is killing us.  Should have been an episode.  Oh, brutal.  I ain't gonna go.  Thank you, Jeff.  It's good seeing you again, buddy.  Thanks for chatting with me.  The animated film, Achmed Saves America, premieres on CMT Friday night at 10. 
[03:08:30]  Perfect.  No more series.  Well, it's like it's one shot special now.  Oh, okay.  So, we hope that it'll go beyond.  Yes.  That's why we want the numbers.  Gotta get the numbers.  You make more, yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Don.  What the hell?  See you guys tomorrow.  Thanks, guys.  The Opie and Anthony show has gone to a close.  Stay tuned to reflect, relive, and get the story.
