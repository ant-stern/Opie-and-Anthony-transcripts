<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts rejecting the idea of "nice" radio, immediately launching into a series of non sequiturs, jokes, and personal anecdotes, including one host's visit to a lesbian bar.  They mocked the evolving terminology for people of short stature, from "midget" to "little person," and discussed a news story about a McDonald's employee with a phobia of little people.  The conversation then shifted to a YouTube video by Larry Sinclair alleging a sexual relationship and drug use with Barack Obama, with the hosts playing audio clips and offering sarcastic commentary.  This led to a discussion about Hillary Clinton, focusing on accusations of her fabricating details of her personal history, including her account of being under sniper fire in Bosnia.  Audio clips from news reports detailing these contradictions were played.

The show then covered a news story about a man masturbating and ejaculating on a woman in a Target store, prompting shocked yet humorous reactions from the hosts and listener calls detailing similar experiences. They debated the difference between "unlucky lottery" and "sucks to be you" scenarios.  Upcoming guests Nick DiPaolo and Floyd Mayweather Jr. were mentioned, along with a brief discussion of Robin Williams' divorce and a news story about Leonid Stadnik, the world's tallest man. The overall tone was vulgar, sarcastic, and irreverent.

The next segment started with a discussion about a listener's friend who couldn't afford shoes but maintained online friendships.  This prompted crude jokes about the man's height and penis size. The conversation then veered towards giraffes and hypothetical ways of harming them, followed by a mocking critique of Larry King's interview with Vince McMahon, interspersed with listener calls often involving wrestling personalities and vulgar language. A listener recounted being shoved onto the ice during a musical chairs game at a New Jersey Devils hockey game.  The discussion returned to highly offensive and misogynistic comments about Hillary and Chelsea Clinton, before circling back to Larry Sinclair's allegations against Barack Obama.  The segment concluded with a comedic advertisement for a fictitious album, further mentions of Nick DiPaolo and Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s upcoming appearances, and continued listener calls about professional wrestling and Larry King's interview.


The main portion of the show included several news stories: a man accidentally killing his wife while shooting holes in his wall; a cheerleader's death during breast augmentation surgery (with criticism of Laura Ingraham’s perspective); and Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s upcoming WrestleMania match against Big Show.  Mayweather Jr. appeared as a guest, discussing the match, his career, and his thoughts on other fighting sports.  The hosts and guests debated whether a previous altercation between Mayweather and Big Show was staged, using video clips.  Violent scenes from classic films were also discussed, comparing older and modern portrayals of violence.  Nick DiPaolo was a guest in the studio throughout much of the broadcast.  The show extensively used soundbites and video clips.

The later segments focused heavily on the 2008 US Presidential election, detailing controversies surrounding Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, including Obama’s association with Jeremiah Wright and the unsubstantiated allegations by Larry Sinclair, which were discussed graphically and repeatedly.  The high cost of the Iraq War and the national debt were discussed cynically.  The bizarre case of Pam Babcock, a woman who remained on a toilet for two years, was described with graphic details and offensive language.  A "Slow News Day" segment featured unusual news items. Nick DiPaolo was again in studio, contributing to the offensive humor.  A phone interview with "Big A" was conducted.

The final segment centered around a comedic bit about a man in a bloody bunny suit disposing of a dead hooker's body after an accidental overdose.  The hosts discussed increasingly absurd scenarios, referencing "Very Bad Things" (although initially unaware of its plot). The segment included listener-submitted lines of the day (often sexually suggestive or offensive), mentions of their feud with the Maxwell Show, plugs for various websites and fan sites, and further contributions from Nick DiPaolo, who promoted his shows.  Jimmy Norton was mentioned and mocked before the show ended with abrupt goodbyes and insults directed at Jimmy Norton.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go Screw! 
[00:00:30]  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial Radio Personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talkshow Radio Hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shotguns, Opie and Anthony.  I want to pet a deer.  Go petting zoo, you dummy.  I want to pet a deer with breast knuckles.  Cock-a-bob and breast knuckles.  Opie and Anthony.  This weekend, I went to a lesbian bar. 
[00:01:00]  Were they making out and stuff?  Yeah, there was some making out.  What did it smell like in one of them burped?  An old tackle box.  Is he where entertainment is going?  Larry King gets confused when friend Drescher starts speaking Spanish.  The power of Christ compels you.  She's speaking in tongues, ladies and gentlemen.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning. 
[00:01:30]  Hi.  Good morning to the little people of America.  Little people.  Hello, little person.  How are you today?  They used to be called midgets.  What do you mean, used to?  Midgets.  They're still called midgets in my world.  Believe me, to everybody, they're still called midgets.  You just nod your head to the left and go,  Hello, little person. 
[00:02:00]  How are you today?  Isn't that kind of demeaning?  That kind of sucks, actually, because probably the alarm went off.  We're on there.  And for that split second, they woke up and forgot that they were a midget.  And it's like instantly reminded, oh, that's right.  I'm a freak of nature.  Yeah, we wrecked their dream.  They were probably playing in the NBA.  Oh, yeah.  Or at least just being able to walk down the street with dignity.  Yeah.  Spiking the ball over a volleyball net.  You know what I mean?  And we have to spoil their dream by calling them a little person. 
[00:02:30]  Little person.  Hello, little person.  How are you today?  You wake up smiling and they're like, what did you dream?  That you were a superhero?  No, I just dreamt that I was getting my own cereal.  Yeah.  For the first of all.  I didn't need my little stepping stool to have breakfast.  Words hurt.  This is what's so stupid, though.  Like, people call them midgets for many, many years.  That's a bad thing to do.  So now they want to be called little people.  Yeah.  And that's going to be the thing. 
[00:03:00]  The thing.  And then, I don't know, five or six years are going to go by and they're going to go,  hey, we don't want to be called little people anymore.  That's demeaning.  It's like, because that to me is like, you're like people, but you're only, you're little.  Right.  You're almost like a real person.  Yeah.  If you weren't little.  Just say it.  Hello, little person.  How is that better than a midget?  Could you walk up to a midget and say, hi, little person?  They'd be all, hey, what are you talking about? 
[00:03:30]  Don't call me a little person.  And then they would throw jabs upwards toward your crotch.  Right.  They are dangerous as far as those punches are concerned.  Boy, are they.  It's all just right in the critical area.  Like it hits you right in the tank.  No problem.  So we wake up the little people of America today.  Those Vienna sausage fingers.  Why are they curled up into a fist?  They can't even make a fist.  It's just bent a little bit.  And their muffin-like palm of the hand.  The little muffin hand. 
[00:04:00]  It's like a little baby hand, isn't it?  It's just like a freaky little wrinkled baby hand.  Yeah, midget would be mad if you just grabbed his hand and went, aw.  That's adorable.  I don't even know why I make it fun.  Because that little people big world, it brings a tear to my eye every once in a while.  Tears of laughter.  Just laughing at him, going, thank God that's not me.  We've got to get Matt Roloff on this show.  I'm telling you, you'll fall for the guy. 
[00:04:30]  Will I?  Yeah, the guy's cool as hell.  All of them.  The guy's cool as hell, man.  Maybe he's dangerous.  They're like when a kid leaves his skateboard around.  If you're not looking, you step on him, trip on him.  Yeah, don't get underfoot.  You're underfoot.  Like a dog.  Heel.  Heel, midget.  There's a story that has us laughing today.  A midget, what, scaring a McDonald's worker?  Apparently so.  Oh, listen to this.  Ethan Wade is a customer of McDonald's, who also happens to be a little person. 
[00:05:00]  Tonight he's speaking out and calling for change after the way he says a McDonald's employee reacted to his dwarfs.  On March 9th, Ethan Wade went through the McDonald's drive-thru on Howell Road in Greenville County.  He got a fish fillet and a double cheeseburger.  He went through the drive-thru.  Yeah, one of those little Jeeps that they put out for kids.  That'd be great.  Or one of those stupid little kiddie bubble cars.  You see those things they pedal around in.  And he had a double burger. 
[00:05:30]  He had a family of six to feed.  He went through a drive-thru.  The drive-thru.  The employee must have thought it was a car with a ghost drive.  Hey, down here.  Hey, hey.  County.  Got a fish fillet and a double cheeseburger.  And I pulled through the drive-thru and I checked my order and it was incorrect.  So I walked back inside the store to get my order corrected.  Wade says what made things worse was the way an employee reacted to his appearance.  And when she came around and spotted me, she threw her hands up in the air. 
[00:06:00]  So I'm yelling, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.  And ran to the back of the restaurant.  That's better.  Continued to yell as she was in the back of the restaurant.  He says another employee was so startled by the response, he thought Wade was there to rob the restaurant.  Why?  Kids kind of react like that.  Understandable.  But grown adults to act like that, that's just not acceptable.  Wade says a supervisor said the employee had a phobia of little people and compared it to being scared of snakes and spiders.  Yeah, they're in the same category as scary little reptiles and bugs. 
[00:06:30]  Snakes and spiders.  Oh, is that fantastic?  Wasn't that a great story to start the Opie and Anthony show?  So good morning to you little people, midgets, dwarfs, whatever you're called.  We should do phobias today.  Actually, that is a real phobia because my brother, I'm serious, the fine owner of FH Riley's there in Huntington Village,  400, what, New York Avenue?  Of course. 
[00:07:00]  He is scared of midgets.  Yeah, some people are scared of midgets.  Some have a clown phobias, things like that.  It's a little freakish.  But a midget phobia, I guess you could get away with that if the person tries to maybe sue you.  Yeah.  Some kind of...  You have a phobia, you know.  What do I have a phobia of?  Uh, your phobia is you don't like telling people what you did on your vacation!  Well...  You think I forgot?  Uh, no.  I think I was very in-depth and detailed about what I did on my vacation yesterday. 
[00:07:30]  I bought electronic equipment and I sang karaoke at a bar and I had a good time.  It was nice to relax, wake up a little late.  Uh-huh.  It's sort of taking its toll now because it's kind of hard if we get up early.  But, uh, yeah, that's, you know...  We're just getting back into the swing of things.  That was my vacation.  There's more to it.  It'll come out.  Is there?  Yes, there is. 
[00:08:00]  Uh, also, uh, really fast.  I don't even know how...  Do we need a disclaimer before we play this next piece?  It's all over.  Huh?  It's all over the place, right?  Well, I don't think anyone has played it on radio yet.  Well, no.  I don't want to be sued by the Obamacare.  Oh, Obama's not going to sue.  Uh, the Philly crew brought to my attention last night that there is this video on YouTube  of this guy.  What's his name?  Larry Sinclair?  Yeah.  Oh, Larry Sinclair is going to be a YouTube sensation. 
[00:08:30]  A big star.  He...  I mean, it's starting to, like, grow.  But by the end of today or tomorrow, this could be the next chocolate rain.  I'm telling you right now.  It's going to be a biggie.  Larry Sinclair, and there's already other people, like, trying to imitate Larry Sinclair.  Yeah, anytime there's a YouTube sensation, people then do the exact same thing.  Right.  Trying to act out the sensation.  And it never really works, by the way.  No, not never as good.  So this Larry Sinclair guy decided to make a YouTube video. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  And he's alleging all sorts of things between himself and Barack Obama.  Barack Obama.  And, uh, it's clear to me that, uh, the guy is out of his mind.  He's a little kooky.  He is a little kooky.  Larry Sinclair, I guess he, uh, he's a limo driver.  He's claiming, uh, he had sex with Obama.  Yeah.  He's claiming he, uh, did drugs with Obama. 
[00:09:30]  Sure.  Hung out and drank with him.  Yeah.  Jimmy, listen to this, uh, this, uh, this guy.  Oh, you'll love this gentleman.  Hi.  My name is Larry Sinclair.  I'm making this video and posting it on YouTube because of an incident involving myself and  Senator Barack Obama between November 3rd and November 8th of 1999 in the Chicago, Illinois  area.  The mainstream media and Obama himself has done greatly to prevent this story from becoming 
[00:10:00]  public.  During those time periods in 1999, I met Obama at an upscale lounge in Chicago, Illinois.  After having a few drinks, Obama and I left in my limo, began to drink, Mr. Obama acquired  powder cocaine for my use, crack cocaine for his use.  You know what I love about this?  He's trying to be so like just official, like he's talking to the FBI or something.  Acquired powder cocaine for my use and crack cocaine for his. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, and he's just sitting there like a dope.  He's confused.  Maybe it wasn't, uh, Obama.  Maybe it was Patterson here.  Yeah, it could be.  Stupid Patterson finally said in the paper today, all right, I'll shut up and start governing.  Oh, did he say that?  Yeah, we're like, all right, thank you, sir.  Maybe he shouldn't have said that.  Mr. Obama acquired powder cocaine for my use, crack cocaine for his use.  I performed sex on Senator Obama, who at the time was a state representative for the state 
[00:11:00]  of Illinois.  Mr. Obama knows these allegations to be true.  I'm challenging Mr. Obama to come forth, be honest, stop claiming that his drug use is  limited to his teenage years.  1999, you weren't a teenager.  1999, you were a state representative for the people of the state of Illinois.  1999, I performed a sex on you in the back of my limo, as well as in my hotel room in 
[00:11:30]  Gurney, Illinois, two days later.  Gurney.  If you challenge this, the authenticity of this allegation, I challenge you to take a polygraph  test, as I will submit to as well.  These allegations are true and need to be told to the public.  Let the public decide whether Mr. Obama is being forthright and honest.  Thank you.  Well, I'll say this.  This guy knows how to show his appreciation for powdered cocaine in Baltimore. 
[00:12:00]  This guy sounds like a good egg.  He really knows how to barter.  This guy is a treat for everyone.  He brings a limo and a willing mouth.  I like this guy, right?  How great is that, though?  Gotta love YouTube.  You could just go on there and just, like, come up with all sorts of claims.  Yeah, that's just it, you know?  See, in the old days, you had to, like, mail that in to somebody and hope maybe...  You had to print it.  Hope maybe the local news picks up on your little story. 
[00:12:30]  But now you just throw it up there for everyone to see.  Yeah.  That's the day and age we live in.  Yeah.  Say whatever you want.  Apparently, I think the guy is probably just a kook.  Perhaps doesn't want Obama to be elected.  He did.  So he's saying these things.  But, you know, I wasn't there.  I wasn't there in Gurney, Illinois.  In Gurney, Illinois. 
[00:13:00]  I got powdered cocaine.  He got crack cocaine for himself.  Why wouldn't he just get one?  Why would he have to get varieties of coke?  Well, he likes to crack.  So why wouldn't he just say, look, why don't you just smoke the crack with me?  Yeah.  What's the difference?  Well, he might have said, no, it's got to be powder.  Powder, you don't get any of this.  Or you don't get this sweet mouth of mine.  How great would it be if Obama responded and he came out and he goes, you know, if I remember 
[00:13:30]  correctly, it was you who did the crack and I who did the powdered cocaine.  Yeah.  Get it straight.  And it was me who performed bleep sex on you.  That's right.  Bleep sex.  Remember, you were driving the limo.  What did the limo drive itself?  He just answered it logically.  So these allegations are indeed false.  Our phone number, 877-212-ON-A.  And we'll link that video later today on onaradio.com.  But that was making me laugh pretty hard last night. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, it's a good one.  This treat.  Yes, Jimmy.  Even if it's true, I still like him better than I like Hillary Clinton.  Yeah.  I still like him.  How embarrassing is it that this dummy is getting caught in this lie?  Hillary is just a big liar.  She seems to lie a lot.  Did you see in the newspaper today?  There's a couple of instances of her just BSing.  Yeah.  And it's dumb lies.  They're not even lies like that politicians should be telling.  They're just dumb, stupid, I want attention lies. 
[00:14:30]  What are the new ones today?  She said, at one point she said she was named after Sir Edmund Hillary, who scaled Mount Everest.  That's pretty impressive.  That's pretty cool.  It would be very cool.  I'm named after my mom's best friend's husband.  Well.  Yuck.  I'd rather be named after someone cool.  Sir Edmund Hillary, the man who scaled Mount Everest in 1953, which would be six years after she was born. 
[00:15:00]  And she said this?  She said that she was.  It's such a dumb little thing, but it really shows your personality and, you know, what you're about.  She just seems to be a lying sack of crap.  She also lied about her daughter being near the World Trade Center.  Yeah.  In 9-11, right?  In 9-11, she said that daughter Chelsea was jogging around the World Trade Center when the planes hit.  Where was she in reality?  But when Chelsea herself recounted the tale, she said she watched the planes hit on TV more than two miles away. 
[00:15:30]  You know, she was two miles away.  On Manhattan, that's pretty far away.  Those are the people that sometimes go, you know, I was right there.  If I would have walked two miles west, I would have been right in the thick of things.  I actually did that.  I actually said that I flew into Manhattan the day before 9-11, which is kind of true.  So I try to connect myself to the story. 
[00:16:00]  You know how many people flew into Manhattan the day before 9-11?  I go, dude, man, my flight got in on September 10th.  Yeah.  It was that damn close.  One more day.  It's amazing how, like...  One more day, a different airline.  I mean, you really...  Different destination leaving instead of coming.  Stupid Colin Quinn had the funniest joke about it.  Literally, the week after it happened, Colin's so good.  Usually people are trying to connect themselves to it.  They're like, oh, thank God, I didn't take the two train that day. 
[00:16:30]  Do you normally take the two train?  Oh, no, I've never taken the two train in my life.  Thank God.  Right.  Dude, something told me not to go down there.  Yeah, stupid.  The news.  The news told you.  It's human nature to try to attach yourself to these dumb stories.  Any other lies there before we get to the big one?  Well, she claimed that she'd always been a vigorous opponent of NAFTA until newly released White House records prove she played a key role in lobbying lawmakers to pass the trade bill. 
[00:17:00]  But, you know, she says that she was against it.  A native of Illinois, she spent her entire adult years in the South.  Hillary was a Chicago Cubs fan.  But in 99, she run for U.S. Senate in New York.  She announced on TV she was, in fact, she'd always been a Yankee fan.  Yeah, that whole thing.  Just these little stories about little things.  But she's got to punch up her life. 
[00:17:30]  She's got to punch it up.  She's trying to get every single person to like her, which is impossible in politics.  You've got to make a stand and just go with it.  That's the one thing I did like about Giuliani.  The guy would make a stand.  This is what I believe in.  I know I'm going to piss off these guys and this group.  But I respected that about him.  And the old school politicians seem to be the same way, too.  This is what I believe in.  Bam, bam, bam, bam.  And I don't believe in this, this, this, and this.  And that's it.  Old Ronnie Reagan was pretty much the last president that didn't give a crap what anybody thought. 
[00:18:00]  These new politicians, though, they want to like cater to every single group out there.  It's impossible.  They have all the polls that come out.  And then they try to react to the polls.  And they're constantly doing the polling.  Right.  Hey, you're talking about lies.  And we didn't get to this earlier.  So let's, earlier meeting yesterday, because we had a very busy show, the first show back.  Hillary Clinton lying about Bosnia.  It's worth listening to again here. 
[00:18:30]  It was supposed to be an example of Hillary Clinton's battle-tested experience.  I remember landing under sniper fire.  In the speech last week, Senator Clinton was referring to her visit to Tuzla, Bosnia in 1996 as first lady.  The brutal war was over, but hostilities continued.  And though the trip was exactly 12 years ago tomorrow, the memory seemed etched in Clinton's mind.  I remember landing under sniper fire. 
[00:19:00]  I thought this was a recent trip she took.  I didn't realize that that was a 12-year-old trip.  No, 12 years ago.  I'm like, why would she lie about something she just went and did?  Yeah.  Oh, this is even more annoying.  Yeah, I know.  She's built it up in her head.  There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicle to get to our base.  The problem is, that's not what happened. 
[00:19:30]  And we should know, CBS News accompanied the first lady and daughter Chelsea on that Bosnia trip.  That's Senator Clinton talking to me on the military flight into Tuzla.  And these are the pictures we recorded of the greeting ceremony when the plane landed.  Compare that to Senator Clinton's account.  I remember landing under sniper fire.  There was no greeting ceremony.  And we basically were told to run to our cars.  Now that is what happened.  Now that is what happened.  There was a greeting ceremony.  There's pictures being taken on the runway of her with little girls on the runway. 
[00:20:00]  There was no running.  There was no sniper fire.  The pilot of the plane himself came out yesterday and said, no, didn't happen.  We landed.  Everything was hunky-dory.  She talks to the media like someone would after a cocktail at a party.  She just makes up what she wants.  Yeah.  It was amazing.  And they're all yelling, Hillary, Doc, it's going to be crazy. 
[00:20:30]  Doc, run for your vehicles.  We got to get to the base.  Meanwhile, thinking they can't check on this.  They don't have film of it.  What do you think?  This is 1878?  She's amazing.  Shoot the hostage.  It continues.  Lingy-lingy.  Thank you.  There was no sniper fire either when Senator Clinton visited two army outposts, where she  posed for photos, and no sniper fire back at the base, where she sang at a USO show starring 
[00:21:00]  Sinbad and Sheryl Crow.  Oh.  I can't cry no more.  According to the previous news video, Clinton aides today acknowledged her arrival in Bosnia  was not quite as dramatic as Clinton put it.  She meant that there was fire in the hillside around the area when we landed, which was the  case.  I'm Barack Obama, and I approved this message.  She meant, and then someone has to come out and tell us what she meant, that somewhere  in the world a gun was being fired. 
[00:21:30]  That's pretty much it.  And Compton.  That's what she was saying.  And Compton of all places.  Well, the scary part was the way she, like, she's telling the story, and the frightening  part, I don't know if you have the first part again, is where she tells it, and she laughs  while she's telling it.  Yeah, yeah.  That is, she's a liar.  Yeah.  Because that's like, and then the guy said.  Yeah, that's a nervous little titter that comes out when you're lying about something. 
[00:22:00]  It was supposed to be an example of Hillary Clinton's battle-tested experience.  I remember landing under sniper fire.  In the speech last week, Senator Clinton was referring to her visit to Tuzla, Bosnia in  1996 as First Lady.  The brutal war was over, but hostilities continued.  And though the trip was exactly 12 years ago tomorrow, the memory seemed etched in Clinton's  mind.  Was that the last clip?  I think the next one is the clip.  No, and she does the full clip.  It was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just 
[00:22:30]  ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base.  Problem is, that's not what happened.  And we should know.  CBS News accompanied the First Lady and daughter, Chelsea, on that Bosnia trip.  That's Senator Clinton talking to me on the military flight.  All right, well, you get the damn rich horse.  Whoa, hey, oh.  Damn rich horse.  Whoa, hey.  That is amazing how she laugh-lied.  Yeah.  You know, I got it, baby. 
[00:23:00]  My fat.  I got it.  Oh, my God.  She's a liar, liar.  Pants are fat.  Before we take our first break, we beat her up pretty good.  We got to bring her back up now.  We have to.  Oh, do we?  That's what we do with this show now.  Yes.  One, two, three.  Oh.  Oh.  I thought I forgot.  I did.  She's going to do it.  Do it.  Give her just a chance. 
[00:23:30]  She'll make it.  Any glass deal.  She'll break it.  She's going to be your president.  She's a lying C-word.  Nothing's going to turn her back now.  Straight ahead and on the track now.  With plans to make our dreams come true.  Hillary Clinton.  There's nothing she can do.  Never heard the word impossible this time. 
[00:24:00]  There's no time for a chance.  She's going to do it.  On your mark, get set and vote now.  Vote now.  Got a dream and got a know-how.  Idiot.  Here's plans to make our dreams come true.  Working for us all day.  Hello, exactly.  Make all our dreams come true.  Working for us all day.  Yes, all day. 
[00:24:30]  Make all our dreams come true.  For me and you.  I was only joking.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  There you go.  All right, we're heading toward our first break here.  Let's do that.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Phones are ringing if you want to get through.  877-212-O-N-A. 
[00:25:00]  Hey, good morning to everybody.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi.  A few of the listeners are bitching that the Homer clip was so loud that they didn't really  hear the midget McDonald's story.  Well, that happens occasionally.  I do notice sometimes the audio is a little loud over the clip.  Sometimes.  We could try it again. 
[00:25:30]  It's a quick story.  We might as well.  All right.  Just in case you missed it.  This story is making his lap pretty hard today.  Ethan Wade is a customer of McDonald's who also happens to be a little person.  Tonight he's speaking out and calling for change after the way he says a McDonald's employee  reacted to his dwarfism.  On March 9th, Ethan Wade went through the McDonald's drive-thru on Howell Road in Greenville County.  Got a fish fillet and a double cheeseburger and I pulled through the drive-thru and I  checked my order and it was incorrect.  So I walked back inside the store to get my order corrected. 
[00:26:00]  Wade says what made things worse was the way an employee reacted to his appearance.  And when she turned around and spotted me, she threw her hands up in the air, started  yelling, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, and ran to the back of the restaurant, continuing  to yell as she was in the back of the restaurant.  He says another employee was so startled by the response, he thought Wade was there to  rob the restaurant.  I've seen kids kind of react like that, understandable, but grown adults to act like that, that's  just not acceptable.  Wade says a supervisor said the employee had a phobia of little people and compared it 
[00:26:30]  to being scared of snakes and spiders.  And midgets.  Right.  That's funny.  He's like, ah, you know, he's already accepted the fact that kids are going to joke and make  fun of them.  Yeah.  But adults, keep that behind closed doors where it belongs.  Adults learned.  The adults laugh the hardest.  Yes.  Maybe not right to your face, but they're certainly laughing.  She was a little petrified.  We got someone on Instant Feedback, they don't have their name. 
[00:27:00]  If you Instant Feedback us from a cell phone, you know, just to get a little credit, you  got to throw your name in there.  This guy writes, or this gal writes, wow, Hillary Clinton is the new Commander McBrague.  Yep.  Quite.  She's a liar.  There I was, landing in Bosnia.  All of a sudden, we came under sniper fire.  My goodness, what did you do, Hillary?  She is just full of crap.  And she had Obama on the ropes for a little while with that pastor thing. 
[00:27:30]  That pastor, what a cut up he was.  Reverend Wright, you know, fire and brimstone, very critical of America, black preacher.  Yeah.  And, you know, look, Obama probably believes a lot more of what that reverend said than  he'll admit.  But whatever.  To me, this is worse.  That is true, I think.  I think what you're saying is true.  He probably does believe that.  If he was sitting in a church and this pastor is going off on America and criticizing 9-11 as 
[00:28:00]  it being America's fault, things like that, you'd think he would get up and walk out.  Yeah.  But he sat in there.  You see some of his charitable contributions, too?  He's not very charitable.  He's really busting apart his stereotypes.  Wow.  He gave something like 1% of his income to a charity.  Wait, you care about charities all of a sudden? 
[00:28:30]  I'm very charitable.  Are you?  I'm a pretty charitable guy, but I keep it all on the QT.  I don't usually contribute to organizations because I don't know where that money's going.  And Anthony has a little soft spot in his heart when he reads something in a newspaper.  Yeah.  If something pops up, then I might get involved.  Something pops up in a newspaper.  Next thing you know, you're writing a check.  I write a check.  I'm a softie.  I'm a softie. 
[00:29:00]  You should let the people know that you do that.  That's just a little, you know.  Can you name one of the things you've done?  Maybe the old one with the wheelchair?  Oh, the little friggin' puddin' head girl.  She got her wheelchair stolen.  And, yeah, I felt bad.  And then the story made the paper, and Anthony may have helped get the little thing another wheelchair.  I felt bad for her.  I'm sure you did.  You're very charitable. 
[00:29:30]  The little puddin' head girl.  You're getting me weepy.  Little puddin' head girl.  How did he just ruin a charitable contribution in one clawing swipe?  That's true.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, moving on.  There was one more Brock thing with the preacher, the guy.  Oh, this is the problem with the guy.  It's not that he, the 9-11 stuff, look, that's all just idiotic policy stuff.  But then he starts thinking, like, the government created AIDS to attack people of color. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, I know.  Don't, uh, it's true, but don't say it.  A lot of people believe that, though, Jim.  We, uh, you know.  We created AIDS to get rid of the blacks, and we created the crack cocaine to get rid of the blacks.  Get rid of the housing projects.  Liquor stores are in the black neighborhoods, and they're put there by white people.  Yeah, all that.  Forced them to buy the liquor.  I was talking to.  With Jedi mind tricks.  I was talking to Roy Ennis the other night.  Oh, you were?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Roy and I would sit in 10 times, chat policy. 
[00:30:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Interesting.  At the comedy cellar.  At the cellar?  Roy Ennis was down there.  All the time he actually comes, yeah.  He was, well, not all the time, but he used to.  He was very close with Manny.  And, uh, they would just argue.  It was great.  I bet.  They're both conservatives, and they would just argue.  But, uh, he was saying about, like, where's the, uh, because he doesn't believe in  rhetoric, right?  He goes, where's the federal subpoenas and all the indictments, and where's the subpoena  for all the records to open up, you know?  Well, no one does that because it's not true.  It's made up.  But what was happening there is, you know, it was name dropping. 
[00:31:00]  I saw that, yes.  It was very terrific.  Look at you having, uh, political, uh, little conversations at the comedy cellar.  Man of similar ilk will sit and chit-check.  Really?  Similar ilk?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Cuffed in the same cloth, as it were.  Cloth was dirty when they got him.  Yours was bleached.  Right.  Cloth started out white.  Right.  Hey, uh, this is something, another thing we should have, uh, played yesterday, but we 
[00:31:30]  were way too busy.  Yeah.  Way too busy.  We're just trying to catch up here.  Um, listen, this was the story of the day yesterday that we just couldn't play because  we had so many guests coming by to say hi.  Listen to this one.  Clackamas County Sheriff's deputies were on the trail of another one of Fox 12's Most  Wanted.  He's a man caught on camera in a bizarre sexual assault at the Clackamas Target store.  Now, we want to warn you that some of the details in this story are disturbing and graphic  and not appropriate for everyone.  It is a... 
[00:32:00]  Shut up.  Exactly.  Shut up.  That makes...  If I'm in another room and I hear that disclaimer, I'm running in.  Of course.  To see what this story is about.  They should put that in front of every story and you'd listen intently.  Right.  And when you hear the story, you have to say to yourself, wow, this is really hot.  But you would also have to say, why is the news showing this?  Yeah.  What purpose is the news to titillate you?  Exactly.  But they don't want to tell you that.  They don't want to say that. 
[00:32:30]  So they make it seem like this is terrible.  They're doing a public service?  Look, let me help your parents out.  This is good.  This is pretty graphic.  It's a little sexy.  Right.  That's what they mean.  All right.  Listen to this one.  They can not appropriate for everyone.  It is a very unusual crime.  Deputies say that a woman was shopping in this Target here in Clackamas on Saturday when  what happened next shocked her.  Take a look at the man the deputies are looking for.  He was caught on camera in the store Saturday touching himself and then ejaculating onto the 
[00:33:00]  woman.  You can see he's.  Holy Jesus Palomino.  Are you kidding me?  What?  Wait a minute.  What?  How did this happen?  Where was it?  Was he in a light fixture or a buffer?  Are you kidding me?  Are you kidding me?  How?  Hmm.  What?  There's video of it.  Ah.  Is it on YouTube?  Well.  You don't think everyone is going to YouTube right now to try to find the video?  Where the hell's that video? 
[00:33:30]  That's.  Wow.  That's.  You know what that is?  That's timing.  Yeah.  Because, you know, she's not just going to stand there.  Right.  Maybe he's.  Maybe he's hopping along as he, you know.  You think he's like following her or something?  And.  Why.  What is the purpose of airing this news story?  Yeah.  I mean, I have no problem with it.  I want to hear about this stuff.  Yeah.  But I don't want.  I don't want them to try to, like, make me believe that this is.  This is serving a purpose.  That it.  Yeah. 
[00:34:00]  This should come with.  This should come with a laugh track.  Yeah.  You could say.  You can just say, you know, a woman was sexually assaulted.  Right.  In a target.  Right.  And leave it at that.  But they had to go into the graphic details.  Mm.  Mm.  Next shocked her.  Take a look at the man the deputies are looking for.  He was caught on camera in the store Saturday, touching himself and then ejaculating onto the  woman.  You can see he's carrying a cell phone and what looks like a wallet. 
[00:34:30]  The victim spoke with us today, but didn't want to appear on camera.  She says she was looking at shaving razors when she knew someone was close by and then  felt something hit the back of her pants.  She quickly realized.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  You're just trying to shop.  You're just trying to shop.  Do you not notice the irony of this all happening in Target?  No. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, my God.  They show you the bullseye right on the front of the store.  Oh, this guy rules.  Oh, my God.  Is that funny?  Oh, show your face.  She's shopping.  She's just like, what should I get?  What razor should I?  This one's got three blades. 
[00:35:30]  This is probably a closer shave with that.  Why wouldn't they show her face, by the way?  Why wouldn't?  Who cares if she wants to?  They don't ever ask people if they want to be on camera.  No, and they shove a camera in your face and, uh, yeah.  Wow.  We show the back of our pants.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  You like Huey Lewis in the news? 
[00:36:00]  Uh, and, of course, the, um, perpetrator, uh, had this to say.  Yeah.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Ah.  Well.  It was Steve C.  Yeah.  Hello.  Wow.  Anyway, there's more to the story here.  Let's see.  Of course there is.  The man's got a chance.  She quickly realized the man had been masturbating in the middle of the store and had ejaculated  onto her.  She tells us the worst part of the ordeal, which she calls disgusting, is that her three-year-old 
[00:36:30]  daughter was there at the time, but she's thankful the girl didn't seem to really see  or know what happened.  The woman says she's shaken up and doesn't want to go shopping by herself anytime soon,  but she does want this man to be taken off the streets.  Sheriff's deputies say they're seriously concerned about what they determine is a very repulsive  act, and they're testing right now to see if the suspect has any sexually transmitted  diseases.  I'm sorry I did that.  I'm embarrassed that I did that.  That would be a super disease, going through all those clothes. 
[00:37:00]  Well, yeah.  I'm sure they just want to see if he's, uh, you know, if he does anything else.  Yeah.  I've made an ass of myself.  Damn.  You've just been pwned.  Oh, are you?  Well, I understand it's unpleasant, but lady, get a hold of yourself.  I don't want to go.  I'm afraid to go shopping by myself.  Yeah.  How often does it happen?  You're the only person in the country this has ever happened to.  Yeah.  Stop.  What are the odds? 
[00:37:30]  If it happened to you once, you got it out of a plane crash.  You don't have to worry for the rest of your life.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You get that one out of the way, right, Jimmy?  It's not going to happen again.  Man.  Unbelievable.  That is, uh, hmm.  Good, right?  Yeah.  Good story.  Pitted.  So pitted.  Yeah.  Pitted.  So pitted.  Let's, uh, say hi to Keith in Jersey.  Keith, this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  How are you, sir?  Good.  How are you guys doing?  All right.  I'm a big fan of the show and I so happen to hear you guys this morning talking about 
[00:38:00]  the news article about the, uh, woman who had some unpleasant on her in the store.  Yeah.  Wow.  Look at you knowing how to do radio.  Love this guy.  Good man.  Well, there's, uh, this so happens to be a couple of different websites that you can  get to where in Japanese culture, they do this on a constant basis and put it on the  web as comedy.  Really?  Oh my God.  I need to, I need to, I need this website immediately.  Is that really something that's, um. 
[00:38:30]  I wouldn't be surprised.  Out of the culture?  There's more than one guy, uh, calling saying they do this a lot in Japan.  Yeah, it's big time in Japan.  They actually have something also called sharking.  Sharking.  They run up behind women and rip their tops off and just run away.  Danny ran in because he knew exactly what you were talking about.  You beat him to it.  You know what this sharking is all about?  I've seen a bunch of these videos.  I mean, the majority of them look fake.  Of course.  But, you know.  It's fake.  That's what, that's what it is called. 
[00:39:00]  And there are plenty of videos of, you know, if, if anybody wants to even bother to look  for it.  It's talking about working for a living.  I'm talking about sharking.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I figured you got a kick out of that one.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  No problem.  Good luck.  All right.  Let's, uh, say hi to Chris in Longbrunch.  Uh, Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  He's, I, that guy just said everything I was going to say on the radio.  Oh, okay.  I wasn't sure he had more to add.  But I got, I got a couple of sites for you. 
[00:39:30]  If you want to put me on hold and then you can check them out.  Yeah, definitely.  Hold on.  All right, cool.  Uh, let's say hi to Adam in New York.  Adam.  Hey, I just called to let you know, uh, my wife worked in one of those center booths  in the mall.  And there was a kid, uh, sitting on one of the benches right across from her and he  was, uh, jerking under the coat.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Yeah, you gotta.  Whoa.  You gotta kind of, bam, you know, yeah.  So the guy was sitting across from, she works in one of those kiosks in the middle of the 
[00:40:00]  mall and he was sitting on a bench and he was taking care of business, uh, on the bench  by himself.  And now he'll listen to the radio and get a little edumacation.  Thank you, uh, sir.  All right.  Uh, let's go to Steve on Long Island.  Steve.  Hi.  Hey, Opie Anthony.  What's up, Steve?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Um, my buddy, uh, he lives out in the Hamptons.  He's got, um, quagga, I should say.  He's got a housemaid that used to come to his house and he'd watch her through the, uh, 
[00:40:30]  bedroom, crack of the bedroom door.  Yeah.  And one day she was bending over, cleaning the toilet and he runs to the bathroom and he relieves  herself on her as she's cleaning the toilet and runs away.  And the woman couldn't speak a lick of English and the parents couldn't figure why she wouldn't  come back to the house.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Maybe we, maybe we can't take any more phone calls on this subject because we'll try one  more, but I don't, I don't know.  This, this looks fake. 
[00:41:00]  I don't know.  Cause he has, what the hell is wrong with these people?  Explain what you're saying.  Well, we're watching, uh, I guess these are videos.  It's taken in Japan of guys that are running up behind women, wearing little skirts and  pulling the skirts up.  So their underwear showing, and then they just rip the skirts right off of them.  But it does look a little fake.  And some of them do.  Now, I believe these, because what's happening is the women are struggling.  The guys are lifting the skirts real quick. 
[00:41:30]  Just showing like the ass.  Oh, well, panties on.  And the women are freaking out.  And the guy's faces are blocked out.  But it's like, they're just, uh, they're just into some weird crap over there, man.  What are they doing in Japan?  They just ripped her little skirt off.  God, they love shame.  They love shame over there.  What is the whole thing?  I don't get it.  Asian porn has a lot of shame in it.  A lot of crying.  Um, I noticed that a lot of the videos, like, the, the, the, the combination of the video 
[00:42:00]  is the girl, like, weeping somehow.  Yeah, yeah.  I love that.  Yeah, we're watching just, uh, video after video.  It's like a montage of girls getting their skirts just completely ripped off of, off of  them.  That just makes me feel bad for panties.  Yeah.  Look at this lady.  She's like, what are you doing?  Because then they just run away.  They're really violent with it.  Yeah.  Like, because sometimes the, the skirt doesn't come right off, so they kind of drag them onto  the ground.  You think it's real?  Some of it is probably some of it. 
[00:42:30]  I think, uh.  You think some of it's real?  Steve, real or fake?  What do you think?  100% real.  100% real.  That means it's fake.  All right, great.  Jeez, that woman was left with pretty much nothing on.  Some you could see are fake, and some are real.  Wow.  All right, that was real.  The guy just ran up.  And she's lifting the skirt up and pulling the panties down to expose her buttocks.  Yeah, that's pretty, uh.  Pretty great.  Let's go to Michael in Minnesota.  What is wrong with the people?  They are twisted in Japan. 
[00:43:00]  They're the weirdest stuff they like.  Let's say hi to Michael.  What's up, Michael?  Did they say at the end of that story, police determined this was a repulsive crime?  What, did they get together and talk about it?  Oh, this was kind of funny.  No, you know what?  Maybe it's still a repulsive crime.  Yeah, exactly.  I thought this was, uh, repulsive.  Well, let's take a consensus here.  Let's get a consensus.  Hands raised?  Repulsive?  Repulsive?  Captain, what do you think?  Well, we've determined that it's repulsive.  All right, thank you, sir.  Let's say hi to Dan in Jersey.  Dan, what's up? 
[00:43:30]  Hey, uh, was this unlucky lottery or sucks to be you?  I guess it's a sucks to be you.  Yeah, this is an old bit we've been doing for years and, uh, it's called sucks to be you  or unlucky lottery, which are kind of similar.  Kind of similar, but I consider unlucky lottery something that is so beyond reason to happen.  The odds of it are just millions to one.  Like the Ray from yesterday.  Mmm, which one was that? 
[00:44:00]  Were you here yesterday?  Oh, right, the Ray.  I'm thinking Ray like a death ray or something.  No, the lady that was in a boat.  The sea monster.  The sea monster decides to jump out of the water and smacks the lady in the face, killing her.  In the face, killing her.  That's unlucky lottery.  Because the odds of that are just completely ridiculous.  Millions to one.  It's usually a big boulder is on a mountainside.  It's been there overlooking the mountains since dinosaurs were walking around, and, uh, when  your car is driving by it, it decides at that moment to let loose and roll into your car. 
[00:44:30]  Which happened, by the way.  And crush you.  Yeah, that happened.  That was a real story back in the day.  I think that's what started this whole thing.  Yeah.  That's unlucky lottery.  Sucks to be you is something that isn't that rare.  It's rare enough, but it's not rare enough to be unlucky lottery.  It's not millions to one, but it just sucks to be you.  You can see it happening again.  Like, you can't see a ray jumping out of the water and killing another lady anytime soon. 
[00:45:00]  In the face, right.  Anytime soon.  60 pounds of fish meat in the face.  But you can certainly, uh, see another guy doing what he did to this lady at Target.  Right.  It's not out of the, completely out of the ordinary.  All right, we got to take another break here.  Oh, unlucky lottery.  God must have his hand in it somehow.  Now, that seems to be one of the definitions.  The good Lord must have his hand in it and hate you, by the way.  Right.  That's usually.  The Lord hates your ancestors. 
[00:45:30]  And he's making you pay.  God hates you.  Let's go to Brady in Queens.  Brady.  Yeah, it's Grady, but, uh.  Oh, Grady, what's up?  Grady.  Married man, are you?  But, uh, yeah, gentlemen, uh, this is definitely, uh, a hard decision.  Lots of, uh, fish meat in the face or, uh, some, uh, on the pants.  I don't know which one is worse here.  Hmm.  Well, the fish, uh, in the face woman is dead.  Yeah.  So that's probably worse. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, I would.  Although Steve from Bayshore said, old custard pants ought to just shut her mouth.  Yeah, I would, uh, I would, I would deal with what happened, uh, in Target.  You'd have to, you'd have to choose that one over the two.  Well, yeah.  I wouldn't be too happy about it, but at least you're still living.  So you'd take, you'd take that over the fish in the face? 
[00:46:30]  Yes!  I want to live!  Oh, jeez.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I want to live!  Oh, jeez.  How's the beard?  In either case?  Huh?  In either case, guys, it still smells like sex.  Okay.  I know.  I get his fish reference.  Wah, wah, wah.  Oh, I could do that for you.  Oh, boy.  You did it yourself.  Yeah, right.  Yeah.  I'm outie, Ope.  All right.  Outie.  Hey, thank you, sir.  Hey.  I want to say hi to all the brother mans out there.  Oh. 
[00:47:00]  All right.  Catch on.  Phone number, 877-212-018.  Yes, Jim?  Just to plug, 8 o'clock, we have Nick DiPaolo is here, and we also have Floyd Mayweather  is coming in today.  Ooh.  Yeah, he's part of that WrestleMania thing.  Yeah, plug and WrestleMania.  You know, after the break, maybe we should play a couple very short clips of Vince McMahon  on Larry King, because Larry's just terrific.  He's a terrific broadcaster.  Oh, he's the best.  He's worth every penny he's getting.  What happened to him?  I don't know.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:47:30]  Opie and Anthony on your radio dial.  Radio dial.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hey, where are you going to be this weekend?  Trying to make this sound natural for you.  I'm doing Seattle tomorrow night.  I fly out today.  I forget the name of the theater, but I'm going to go to my MySpace page, MySpace Jim Norton.  And then Saturday night, I'm in Portland, Oregon.  First time ever.  Very cool.  Say hi to BJ Shea while you're out there in Seattle, Washington.  Yeah, I'm doing his show tomorrow.  In other news, the Egg McMuffin inventor. 
[00:48:00]  Yes.  Is dead.  You're kidding.  At the age of 89.  How did this happen?  Probably high cholesterol.  Could be.  Those things are...  No, actually, 89.  That's more like natural causes at that point, I'm thinking.  Ah, right.  They're going to be stuffing him in a McHuffin.  Little styrofoam thing.  And Robin Williams getting a divorce. 
[00:48:30]  I don't know.  Like, whatever.  From the nanny, though.  That was a big story when it happened years ago.  He had some nanny that was taking care of his kids with his first wife.  And he ran off with her.  Just decided, eh, I like this nanny chick.  Yeah.  And, you know, dumped the wife.  And now 19 years later, they've been married 19 years, they have kids together.  And now he's dumping the nanny.  Any reason?  I don't know.  Yeah?  Yeah, she got old. 
[00:49:00]  She finally realized she didn't understand any of his jokes and they weren't funny.  He just kept holding up things.  Look, a corkscrew.  Look, I made a...  I can make a little dancing ballerina out of a corks...  Can you?  Can you, Robin?  It's hysterical.  Where's the humor?  Everyone's laughing because they feel they're supposed to laugh at Robin Williams.  And other people just, you know, stay quiet.  Right, Jimmy?  Yeah, because they...  I think...  I'm telling you, man.  Me and Colin one time...  A long time, he was at the cellar one night.  And we went down there just to... 
[00:49:30]  As they say, player head because we were just being dicks.  And we stood there and just watched him.  And it was like...  It was all topical.  It was just great.  I mean...  Was it?  Yeah, man.  It really was.  You know something?  Maybe if I actually saw his stand-up, but I'd never see it.  I just see him on shows trying to be over the top.  And I see the audience laughing hysterically at what amounts to really nothing.  He's just really not saying anything.  Well, why don't we get a little taste of Robin Williams?  A desk.  A little taste there, Iraq. 
[00:50:00]  Find something we can play later on in the show.  And we'll decide.  Yes.  You decide.  I like the serious...  We're in the no-spin zone.  I like the serious Robin Williams.  I like when he grows out to be here...  He's a good actor.  ...and does the serious roles.  I like that Robin Williams.  He's a good actor.  Hey, we got another giant story.  Well, one of the big people?  Big people.  We had a little...  They call them big people?  We had a little person story earlier.  Now we got a big person story.  And if you're a faithful listener of this show, we can't get enough of these giants. 
[00:50:30]  They hit the news every once in a while.  Stupid pituitary gland.  What sucks, though, you have to go to other countries, because in this country, you pretty  much can't be eight foot tall anymore.  No?  There's one or two floating around, but...  Older ones, but they check for all that stuff now.  But they figured it out.  It has something to do, what, with the pituitary gland?  The pituitary gland.  And they could, like, shut down the juice that is shooting out to make you just a giant...  Yeah, they give them some kind of drugs. 
[00:51:00]  But in other countries where, you know, the healthcare isn't as good, you still get the freaks.  You still get the freaks, which I love.  Well, they're poor and stupid.  Where's this one?  From Ukraine?  Very nice.  Yeah, somewhere.  Somewhere over there.  Listen to this guy.  Listen closely.  The world's tallest man lives in one of Ukraine's impoverished villages.  At eight feet, five inches tall, Leonid Stadnik is starting to pick up a few perks, though.  Great success. 
[00:51:30]  Just, any time I think of one of these impoverished former Soviet countries, just think of Borat.  Of course.  Great success.  The Jew.  Leonid Stadnik is starting to pick up a few perks, though.  The largest bike in the world, a special engineered exercise machine, and clothes from all over the world.  Why would you exercise?  What good is it?  Who's going to notice that you trimmed down a little bit?  You're nine foot eight. 
[00:52:00]  And it can't be for health reasons, because those guys don't usually live very long anyway.  No.  And he's got the world's largest bike?  What does that look like?  I bet that's a treat to ride around on.  I bet no one looks at that and just goes, oh my god, what a freak.  You're like, just trying to be a normal guy.  Right.  Just trying to be a normal guy.  We get a bike.  I got my first bike when I was eight years old.  It was 12 feet tall.  It was a little big for an eight-year-old. 
[00:52:30]  Got truck tires, has wheels.  Yes.  Just some obnoxious looking thing.  Just so you could fit in.  Yeah.  Join the circus and get it over with.  Stop trying to fit in.  For Christmas, he got a couple of canoes, and he thought they were shoes, and he put them on.  Walk around with canoe feet on my...  I have to put canoes on there, because I can't afford shoes that big.  They don't make them in my country.  Why don't I speak with an accent?  We don't need the accent. 
[00:53:00]  Of course not.  We just love the fact that that's how they talk.  Just their dopey, deep voice resonating in his huge, freakish body.  It hurts to talk, because of whatever that's doing to his insides, just to try to communicate.  Leonid Stadnik is starting to pick up a few perks, though.  The largest bike in the world, a special engineered exercise machine, and clothes from all over the world.  Stadnik says the perks don't make up for the pain.  The doorways of his home are too short, forcing him to crouch down when he walks through the house. 
[00:53:30]  His 440-pound frame causes constant knee pain, forcing him to occasionally use crutches.  And doctors say he's probably still growing.  The 37-year-old former veterinarian quit his job after developing frostbite while walking to work.  He couldn't afford to buy custom-made shoes for his 17-inch feet, so he walked in socks.  Stadnik says the outpouring of international support has kept his spirits up. 
[00:54:00]  Media attention brought online friendships from all over the world.  And Ukraine's president offered him a supersized car to help him get around better.  Stadnik says he now dreams of finding a soulmate.  Oh, good luck to you.  Keep dreaming.  Keep dreaming on that one.  He loves the WNBA.  Nice seven-foot midget he can get his hands on.  See, this guy is not only tall, he's really stupid.  Why would you walk to work in your socks?  You can figure out something else to put on those freakish feet. 
[00:54:30]  A couple of dead cats.  Cut open their bellies and wear dead cat shoes.  Poor bastard.  Big dope.  I wrote him a letter, too.  I felt bad for him.  Yeah.  What did you say, Jimmy?  Shoot yourself.  I'm trying to find a soulmate, but I have no soul.  God hates me.  God didn't give me a soul.  God was hungover that day. 
[00:55:00]  Just let me keep on growing.  There is no God.  There is no God.  Liddy Rules from Whackbag writes, his bike has two of those old-timey bicycle tires.  You know, the big wheels.  Oh, yes.  The one big wheel and the one little one.  Yeah, who thought of that?  Our ancestors couldn't figure anything out.  About two wheels the same size, dummies.  Yeah.  How long did that take?  In fact, the French president gave him a new car, but the thing is, it's a special car  and it runs on $10,000 a gallon gas. 
[00:55:30]  How great would that be?  Farm yourself out to the circus, you zilch.  His head sticking out the sunroof.  His whole life should just be a children's party.  He's being pointed at.  Balloons tied to his face.  Balloon on each ear, looking stupid.  Be the clown giant man that we like.  Oh, dee-doe, dee-doe.  Janine writes, maybe they mean soulmate.  His dream is a pair of shoes.  What are you talking about soul?  Oh, soul.  Yes. 
[00:56:00]  Very nice, Janine.  Let's say hi to Chris on Long Island.  Chris, what's up?  Good morning, ladies.  Listen, the guy can't afford his shoes, but he has online friendships.  What, he got a cable modem in the house?  Hey, look at that, yeah.  Looks like someone's got their priorities all messed up.  And who would allow him to walk to work and just sucks?  Just sucks.  He's probably got HBO and pay-per-views and everything else, but watch out.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go there.  I think you know, like, the heart can't even pump the blood down to his feet to keep him warm. 
[00:56:30]  Right.  Probably got frostbite in, like, 60-degree weather.  I thought he got frostbite on the top of his head because, like, as he walked, he was going through the clouds.  Oh, right, because of the high altitude.  Boy, that's an exaggeration joke, kids.  We love exaggeration jokes.  He'd have to be really tall for the weather to be different where his head is.  See how tall he is?  You get it?  Mongo. 
[00:57:00]  Hey, Jimmy, you killed in Minneapolis.  Thank you very much, man.  Thank you.  Oh, yeah, good meeting you.  Yeah, thank you.  Was it?  Yeah, I actually remember.  It's funny.  I meet some of the listeners, and I'm like, oh, yeah, you're the guy that calls in all the time.  I don't think I'm going to recognize him, but I normally call him.  The guy that calls in all the time.  But, I mean, like, Mongo, I know that name.  Of course you do.  Why are you shaking your head?  No.  Not too many people try to kill E-Rock.  This guy was a veterinarian.  How many animals do you think he just accidentally snapped their necks? 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, he's just trying to do the right thing, and he's breaking.  He's breaking animals in half.  With his big, bumbling, huge hands.  And he means well, but it's just a pile of animals in the back that have broken in half.  We're going to need you to take the collar off of this kitten.  Okay.  Okay.  Oh, damn.  Sorry.  There goes another one.  Three more, and I can make a shoe.  His favorite animal would work on birds, just because they're at eye level with them. 
[00:58:00]  He's got a stupid head in a tree.  Work on a bird's nest.  Let's say hi to Sean in North Carolina.  Sean.  Morning, boys.  Hey.  Giving this freak a hard time about not having shoes walking to work, but really, two steps,  and he's there.  That's right.  Right.  More of that exaggerated humor that we love on this radio show.  See, he's so tall that his gait would be quite large.  Do you want to send him shoes?  They should send him, like, regular shoes, just the front's cut out of him.  With his big dopey toes sticking out of the front. 
[00:58:30]  Like Hulk.  Let's go to Brian in Montana.  Brian.  Yeah, they ought to get this guy into porn.  He's probably got a cock like a baseball bat.  Well.  Well, good morning to you, Brian.  Thank you for that.  Good morning.  This got the phones lit, though.  I'll tell you that much.  Charlie, Long Island.  What's up?  Hey, Anthony.  How much are you cutting the check out for this month? 
[00:59:00]  I'm not going to send this guy any money.  Do you feel sorry for this guy?  I only feel sorry for Americans.  Oh, really?  That's the only people I'm very charitable with.  No, that's not true.  It's not true?  No.  You feel sorry for white Americans.  Well, wait a minute.  There's a lot of black charity cases out there.  I know a lot of black people give to black charities.  Of course.  The United Negro College Fund.  Is there another one?  I don't know.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  He's still the king of the instant feedbackers. 
[00:59:30]  Yes.  Not to steal from Howard.  Sorry.  That sounded like that.  But Steven S. from Bayshore writes, his specialty was giraffe dentistry.  Open.  Open wide.  Open.  Open wide.  Okay, spit.  Giraffe dentistry. 
[01:00:00]  Very nice.  He goes to open the giraffe's mouth and the giraffe just knows there's something wrong with it.  And the giraffe kind of recoils like.  He shouldn't be up there.  Yeah, like, why are you looking me in the eyes?  Stupid giraffe gums breath.  If it smells like leaves.  Berries.  How punchable are giraffe necks?  I've never met a giraffe, but I'm obsessed with strangling one.  But where do you strangle?  Yeah, up by the head or down by the body.  I guess wherever your hands can get around.  Yeah. 
[01:00:30]  I'd like to clothesline one.  That would be funny.  Just watch his neck bend like one of those long balloons.  How are giraffes just not attacked?  How do every other animal just not go for the throat?  It's all throat.  It's all hooves.  Something happened in nature that they were able to survive all these years.  Because they could get to the leaves up at the top of the trees that the other animals can't get to.  You could get to the neck, like you were saying.  I don't know.  Lions don't really take down giraffes.  You never see, like, a predator jumping on a giraffe's back. 
[01:01:00]  I bet they're too, like, their hooves are probably very strong.  Yeah.  And they probably fight like the chick.  They just trample panic.  Like, those animals are just going, ah, trample panic, trample panic.  They just kind of jump up and down on you.  They just trample panic, trample panic.  They just fall apart at the seat.  Step on you.  First, there's one panicky peat.  I like this one.  That's how they survive.  Zebras do this all the time, too.  There's one in the crowd that kind of looks up and then turns and their ears go up.  And then runs and the rest of them, trample panic, trample panic. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, and the guy's like, did you hear any?  Did you hear that?  I think there's a lion trample panic.  But they step on their opponent.  Like, they don't know what to do.  So, like, as the lion's mauling them, they're just like, ah, ah, ah.  They're just stepping on them with their dumb hooves.  How many giraffes have strong necks, too?  It's probably hard to get through.  It's probably all, like, single muscle.  A lot of muscle to hold that head up there that high, I guess.  It's not a big head, though.  No, a little peanut head.  A little stupid head with those dumb little antennas. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  What the hell those horns on their head are all about?  Their hats don't fall off.  Nature put in a defense so that their fedoras don't slip off because their hooves can't  pick them up.  Why don't you put a hat on a giraffe's head?  It either stays there forever because if it falls off, he has no one to put it back.  Fedora.  Sure as, it's an unknown fact, but they love hats.  They're a hat-loving animal.  Wouldn't you love to put a fedora on a giraffe?  How funny would that be to some savage just watching this giraffe walk by with a fedora 
[01:02:30]  on?  Has no idea what's going on.  But you know how cocky he'd be because he had the hat and no one else did it?  Hey, look, a picture of a giraffe with a hat.  Yeah.  Where'd you get that, E-Rock?  Just so they could.  Just Google giraffe hat.  Of course you did.  That's so they could root for their favorite baseball team.  They want to wear a hat.  Yes.  Okay, let's say hi to Sean in Cincinnati.  Sean.  Morning, boys.  Welcome back.  Hey, thanks, Sean.  We were back yesterday.  Most people didn't notice that. 
[01:03:00]  All he was wanting was a pair of red shoes, Roe.  Liggle up.  Liggle, liggle.  Liggle.  Christmas shoes for the giant, Roe.  He got frostbite.  I started crying, Roe.  Boo-hoo.  Christmas boats.  Christmas canoes.  You can do what you want, but don't step on my blue suede canoes.  I'd love to meet this giant and bite his big foot. 
[01:03:30]  Bite his big toe.  Sink my teeth into it.  Just way back in your molars.  Yeah, just...  And just...  Just real hard.  Just gnaw on his big toe.  Max, Dallas, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  I always thought it would be funny to string a piece of wire like they do in the war movies  to a guy on a motorcycle, on a giraffe, and just rip their head off.  Jesus, Max.  Well, you've taken this to a very cool place.  We were talking about giving them hats.  We were keeping it fun.  But the way Max and I have always thought about, like, this is a recurring theme for you. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, always.  Every time he drives by at Toys R Us, he just thinks of that Jeffrey the giraffe being decapitated  and how hilarious it would be.  That's piano wire.  Gonna pull over and have a laugh to Johnny Ola.  Goes to Johnny Ola, Jeffrey the giraffe.  Yeah, Jeffrey the giraffe showed me.  You broke my heart, Fredo.  Let's say hi to Matt in Georgia.  Matt. 
[01:04:30]  Hi.  Hi.  Matt, you're 7'4"?  Yes, sir.  You know, the funny thing is, you know, my wife's only 5'5", so, you know, whenever we  go to the mall or something, I get out of there, I just gotta walk away.  She's gotta run behind me and shit.  Looks funny, though.  Oh, well, let's not curse too much here.  Yeah, you tall people like to curse.  I'm sorry.  So, did you play hoops or what?  I'm sure you ask that all the time.  I actually got kicked out of the YMCA for being too rough.  Uh, so I didn't really play all that much basketball. 
[01:05:00]  I was really big in football, though.  Football.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know.  7'4"?  7'4"?  Pretty.  Yeah, I hit my...  Are you gangly?  Are you gangly or muscular?  Um, I'm actually a little portly, to be perfectly honest with you.  How much do you weigh?  Wow.  350 pounds.  He's got a shop at that store that has, like, one pair of pants for him.  One shirt.  Anyone else...  Just like Fred Flintstone.  It's the same thing every day. 
[01:05:30]  Anyone else notice that this phone call is going nowhere?  Well, we're like, this guy's been waiting years to be able to participate in the Opie and  Anthony show, and here's his big moment.  No way.  Hey, I'm...  They got a story about a tall guy, and I'm tall.  I better call in.  I'm going to call in and tell him.  I got a great story for you.  All right, let's go.  Okay.  Um, last year I was playing laser tag, right?  And we're running around in the place.  Must have looked stupid.  And, uh, no shit.  I actually ran...  Hey!  What did we say about the cursing there? 
[01:06:00]  Damn it.  So you were doing some of that laser tag.  Laser tag.  Yeah, I, uh, actually ran around the corner and beat my head on.  A sprinkler.  A water sprinkler.  You know what's that hang from the ceiling?  We assumed that, yes.  Yeah, I, I, uh, I cracked my head open on a sprinkler hanging from the ceiling.  No one should have ever...  We heard that.  Yeah, we heard that.  Heard that story already.  Let me ask you this, sir.  What's the worst part about being the height you are?  Uh, everybody constantly asking, how tall are you? 
[01:06:30]  I probably get asked that probably 40 times a day.  It's really...  40.  All right, well, that's not that...  I know, I know how, I know how tall I am.  They know I'm taller than them.  But yet, they continue to ask.  All right, sir.  How about, let me ask you a question.  Not the most annoying part.  What's the worst part?  Like, like, you know, using public bathrooms.  I'm not talking about the irritating questions.  Uh, I can't drive anything other than a, a, uh, big truck, uh, because I'm huge and won't  fit in a car.  You should see me try to get in a Honda. 
[01:07:00]  Uh, and, um, well, I got size 19 shoes, so I have to special order everything out of  a catalog.  And how big is your, uh, you know, your thing?  What do you pack them?  What do you pack them?  Oh, um...  Just give us a number.  It's, it's, uh, um, it's probably, uh, I don't know, nine?  Nine inches?  Yeah, that's good on anyone else.  Nine?  On you, it's a, on you, it's a minuscule embarrassment.  Ah, yeah.  I mean, if you're a 7'4", you gotta be hoping for more than that. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  It just looks silly.  All right, Matt, thank you.  We're gonna move on, because, uh, Sean's got something good here.  Sean in Jersey, what's up?  Not much, guys.  Hey, I was thinking about how he had those online relationships.  Yeah.  What, has he got a huge keyboard?  Can you type him with those big, big, big stupid fingers?  Big mitts.  Yeah, he has a custom keyboard that's just giant.  Yeah, each letter is the size of a fist.  Just so we can type.  Yeah, if he uses a regular keyboard, man, how is anyone gonna decipher what he's trying to say? 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  Oh, look, I get an email from Fluffer.  Right, right.  Big dumb lummox.  Right.  It's supposed to say hi, it's just an H, a J, an X, and a Q, and send by accident.  Big dope.  Big angry typing guy to new level.  Right.  Yeah.  Okay, guys, punch out.  Very nice.  I think we've, uh, come to the end of the... 
[01:08:30]  End of the line on that, uh, story.  Of the giant story.  And scene.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh.  That's very, uh, rude.  Yeah.  That's what shock jocks do.  They burp on the air and people go, wow, that's outrageous.  Shock jock.  Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We're gonna get Nick DiPaolo on the show in a few minutes here. 
[01:09:00]  Also, uh, who's coming in, Jimmy?  Who's coming in?  Uh, the WC.  Oh, sorry.  I didn't know you had a apple in my mouth.  Sorry about that.  Floyd Mayweather, who is, uh, in WrestleMania this, uh, this Sunday night on pay-per-view.  And I'm really psyched that he's coming in there.  Mm-hmm.  Fox is always fun guests.  They punch people in the face for a living.  Uh, and he's bringing, he's bringing his whole entourage.  Like, eight or nine guys are coming in with him.  And yesterday at the Heart Rock Cafe here in New York City, he threw out hundreds.  Yeah. 
[01:09:30]  Not hundreds of dollars, hundreds.  Oh, hundred-dollar bills?  Yeah, so he threw out thousands in hundred-dollar bills.  Let's see if he does that walking in here.  That'd be relatively nice.  He'd better.  That would be nice.  You're exactly right.  Ring Magazine's called this guy the best fighter in the world since 2005.  158 pounds.  And he's fighting, uh, the Big Show, uh, as part of WrestleMania.  And I think Big Show's at least seven foot tall.  Seven feet tall.  If not, uh, taller than that.  Getting back to the Giants story, we missed a couple great ones from Instant Feedback.  Matt D. from Jersey writes, this guy played football. 
[01:10:00]  We were talking to that guy from Georgia.  Seven foot four.  He bore the hell out of the audience.  Uh, but Matt D. writes, this guy played football.  What did he do?  Swat field goals?  And then you got Crisco, who's good for a few, from Whack Bag.  She writes, did he play for the Giants?  Waka, waka, rimshot.  She wrote waka, waka, rimshot, which is very nice.  Okay, phone is, uh, 877-212-ON-A. 
[01:10:30]  WrestleMania, yeah, we're talking about that a lot, uh, as, as the, the big day, uh, comes  upon us here.  It's Sunday on Pay-Per-View.  And, um, Vince McMahon was on Larry King last night.  Yeah.  Larry King gets all the, uh, all the pop culture, uh, superstars.  And he's so relevant.  Yeah.  He knows exactly what to ask.  Boy, he's just the greatest.  Larry King is an old sot.  You know, everyone else is jumping on this one.  We still, I'm telling you, I don't want to do a hoo-hoo-hoo, but we started this thing. 
[01:11:00]  Larry King has completely lost it.  He's lost his mind.  And I think that he's just writing out his contract, and then they're going to get Anderson  Cooper in there.  That's what I'm thinking.  But, uh, Larry just, uh, I don't know.  He's, he's, he's intro-ing Vince McMahon, and, uh, you know, Vince McMahon is the chairman  of, uh, the WWE.  Yeah.  This is how Larry King introduced, uh, Vince McMahon last night.  We've got a terrific show for you tonight.  A salute to WWE, the World Wrestling Federation Entertainment Group. 
[01:11:30]  They're, in fact, they're a multimedia group.  They are everything.  What?  What?  We all know it used to be the WWF, yet they had to change the name to the WWE.  Yeah, because of the World Wildlife Fund.  It's just the World Wrestling Entertainment.  Yeah, it's World Wrestling Entertainment.  Group, if you want to throw that on.  Right.  Well, WWE, F, F, U, uh, wait a minute, what? 
[01:12:00]  Uh, group, they're everything.  What do you mean by that, they're everything?  They make soap, uh, machinery for the, um, ice makers and nuclear warheads.  They got their hands in everything.  A little bit of everything.  Yeah.  They're in the porn industry.  Larry.  He's a boob, isn't he?  Oh, he knows nothing about anyone he talks to. 
[01:12:30]  Well, then Larry goes on to ask, uh, Vince McMahon, whose idea it was, uh, to do WrestleMania.  Okay.  You got the owner of the company on.  And you're going to ask him, whose idea was it?  Well, it was Phil's idea.  He works in the basement.  Yeah, yeah.  He came up with this one for us.  So we killed him and, uh, said it was, uh, our idea.  Right.  What a dumb question.  Who cares whose idea it was?  That's the beauty of Larry King. 
[01:13:00]  Whose idea was it?  How did you come up with the mania part?  You took wrestle, which you do, and then mania.  Yeah.  And, uh, who decided to put that together?  Question, answer, please.  How important is the ropes in wrestling?  Wouldn't they just fall off the ring if there weren't ropes?  So I'm thinking pretty important, the ropes.  Go.  You go.  Now, answer, please. 
[01:13:30]  Before I have another heart attack.  Please.  Well, this is what he asked Vince.  Uh, all the, all the important questions.  He's only being seen by, I don't know, a hundred million viewers across the world.  And this is what he asked Vince McMahon.  Did you come up with this, Vince?  Um, well, again, it's a joint effort.  You know, when you have someone as creative as Triple H or John Cena or, you know, uh, other, uh, stars.  It's everyone throws in their creativity.  Whose idea was it to do WrestleMania?  Uh, that was mine. 
[01:14:00]  Well, of course it was his.  And he said, like, it's a, you know, team effort thing.  Whose idea, though?  Well, it's a collaborative thing.  Oh!  Right.  Who actually came up with it?  I need a name!  I don't know what to ask you.  Ask yourself questions.  I'll sit here.  Why don't you just ask him how come the referees are never looking in the right direction?  Yeah.  If someone gets dust thrown in their eyes.  All right.  Thanks.  Well, Jimmy, the next question is, uh, pretty much not about refs, but it's, it's in that same vein of stupidity. 
[01:14:30]  Ugh.  The elbow.  How important is it to the people's elbow?  The people's elbow.  Do the people really need it?  Did they really need the people's elbow?  Oh.  The Undertaker.  Is he really dead?  Now, how did you get, uh, how did you reanimate a corpse to, uh, wrestle? 
[01:15:00]  Right.  Is he a zombie?  Should we be scared of him?  If he bites another wrestler, will that wrestler become the undead?  Please answer.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Is, this, this, this, Larry's a boob.  Please fix.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Hulkamania.  You combine Hulk and mania again.  That mania thing.  Right.  Where does it come from?  I want, Larry Kingamania. 
[01:15:30]  Ha ha ha.  Uh.  Would a zombie be afraid of garlic like vampires?  He's an idiot.  Yeah, absolutely.  Well, everyone's doing the Larry voice, so I got to kind of get through this.  Of course.  Booby man from Brooklyn. 
[01:16:00]  Stone cold.  Is he really that cold?  And is he stone?  Please answer.  Need answer now.  Well, listen to this one.  This is the big get right here.  That was just kind of the warm up for you people out there.  Larry talking to Vince McMahon last night.  But once in their history, the Harlem Globetrotters lost.  Does it ever happen in wrestling where the winner loses? 
[01:16:30]  I mean, I suppose it probably has happened.  Maybe because of an injury or something like that.  Was that Triple H?  Yeah, he doesn't even know how to answer the question.  When the winner loses, but then he's the winner.  Wait a minute.  What am I saying?  How out of touch is Larry?  He thinks that the beauty of wrestling is the big surprise where the guy that was supposed to win loses.  You dummy.  It's not the Harlem Globetrotters where they win every time against scrubs. 
[01:17:00]  Just the fact that he's mentioning that.  No one has talked about the Harlem Globetrotters.  The Harlem Globetrotters.  Is it like vaudeville wrestling?  Do you pack things in a steamer trunk?  The beauty of wrestling is the unexpected.  It happens all the time, Larry.  How much is he getting again?  I have to ask every time.  Seven, eight million a year for this? 
[01:17:30]  He's making a Harlem Globetrotters reference?  Vince McMahon, is it like the Chicago Black Sox where they fix the World Series?  Please answer.  You're on the air, Toledo.  Now, I noticed you got a wrestler named Gorilla Monsoon.  Is he related to the ape family?  Is he an actual gorilla or a monsoon?  What is he?  If he's a monsoon, how does he travel? 
[01:18:00]  Haystacks Calhoun.  Is it true he's made out of hay?  Is he a hay?  And then why don't people just set him on fire?  Vince to you.  Vince, is it still real to you, damn it?  Thank you, Steve from Bayshore.  Phil writes, in Larry's voice, of course,  Do you really smell what The Rock is cooking? 
[01:18:30]  What is he cooking and why is he cooking?  Do you feed your wrestlers?  Please comment, Triple H.  Why Triple H?  Can I just say your name?  There.  So, how did you get into wrestling?  What's up with George the Animal Steel?  Is he really that hungry?  Is he an animal or steel?  Or just George? 
[01:19:00]  I love what an ass Larry King is.  He can't be taken seriously.  Do the winners sometimes lose?  And then Triple H is trying to make something out of that.  So, I think what Triple H was saying, like, they decide ahead of time who's going to win and lose.  Yeah.  And I guess what Triple H was saying, maybe if someone gets injured, that has to change in the ring.  Yeah, if someone gets injured, they can't.  But Larry doesn't understand that answer whatsoever. 
[01:19:30]  What?  Injured?  Huh?  Isn't the mat, like, padded?  How do people get hurt?  Why a ladder match?  Are they changing light bulbs and get mad at each other?  Please answer.  Oh, man.  This is updating way too fast, too.  And a lot of good ones coming in.  Ah.  Ah, I can't find them now.  Ah.  Oh, here. 
[01:20:00]  Liddy Rolls from Whackbag.  Sergeant Slaughter.  Will he ever become a captain?  You know, I know, uh, back in World War II, they gave, uh, field commissions to sergeants if they did well and promoted them to lieutenant.  Uh, is this going to happen to Sergeant Slaughter?  Please answer.  Junkyard dog.  Is he really a dog for the junkyard?  Or is he, uh...  Oh, wow. 
[01:20:30]  I can't believe I used the bleep word.  Is the fabulous Moolah single?  Hubba hubba, she's hot.  Why do you call it the squared circle?  It's not really a ring, is it, Vince?  It's square.  Rings are round, I know.  I've given enough wedding rings away.  The heartbreak kid. 
[01:21:00]  Is he a kid?  And has he broken any hearts?  He should drink Welch's grape juice.  It'll keep his heart from breaking.  Oh, my God.  Chief James Trumbull.  Was he really a chief?  Is he an Injun?  Oh, my.  Do the winners actually lose? 
[01:21:30]  What?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?  Uh.  Uh, let's say hi to Matt on Long Island.  Matt, what's up?  Is it like the Roadrunner cartoons?  Will a coyote ever win, or does he always lose?  I've never seen him catch that Roadrunner.  That coyote.  And he is wily.  I know that.  But he never seems to catch him.  I thought he got him once, but he only had the puff of smoke that was shaped like him  when he ran away really quickly.  Look, we barely prepare for this radio show, but, man, compared to Larry King, my God. 
[01:22:00]  We at least Google.  We at least do that for this radio show.  We do a little Google.  How mysterious is Ray Mysterio?  Thank you, Blue Heeler.  Kentucky.  The prince of instant feedback, by the way.  Vince, what about Betty Grable as a WWEF diva? 
[01:22:30]  Hubba hubba.  23 skidoo.  Alex from Montreal.  How do you get a cane and a rock to fight?  How do they actually move?  Is the superfly really an insect?  Comet.  Answer.  Now.  Please.  Please.  Let's go to Travis in New Hampshire.  Travis in New Hampshire.  You're on. 
[01:23:00]  Andre the Giant.  Is he really a giant?  Go ahead.  Boo.  Boo.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Mike in Jersey.  Mike, what's up?  If we were playing the Opie and Anthony drinking game this morning, I'd be hammered with all  the impressions that Opie is doing today.  Leave me.  Leave me.  Well, let me acknowledge something.  I like to piggyback Anthony's impressions from time to time, but I'm kind of like Gallagher,  too.  It's Gallagher, but it's a little off.  He's smashing the watermelon. 
[01:23:30]  There is a Gallagher, too.  It's his brother.  They hate each other.  I don't think Anthony's happy to be called Gallagher.  Well, not Gallagher.  I just want to acknowledge that my impressions nowhere is close, but I like to join in the  fun.  Because it's just fun to do this.  That's right.  Pappy in North Carolina.  What's up, Pappy?  Hulkamania.  Is it treatable?  Are there any medications available? 
[01:24:00]  How does one get that?  Is it spread?  Is it airborne?  Is gold dust 14 carat?  Hulkamania.  Joe from Jersey.  What was Coco be wearing of?  CBG from Jersey.  Was the ultimate warrior. 
[01:24:30]  Bruno Sammartino.  Dumb greaseball.  Fred from Brooklyn.  Is that funny?  I love dumb greaseball.  That one never gets old.  See, the Italians don't mind a little.  Nah.  The Italians can take it.  We gots a sense of humor.  That's right.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:25:00]  Big John Stud.  Do you stud him out to breed more wrestlers?  Comment.  We should go to Chavez in Nutley, New Jersey.  Chavez, you're on the air.  How did they get King Kong Bundy off the Empire State Building to wrestle?  I thought he fell and Beauty had killed him.  How did you get him to the ring, Vince?  Answer, please. 
[01:25:30]  Matt Yell from Jersey.  What made Rick rude?  SD Special Delivery Jones.  Does he work for UPS?  We haven't run something in the ground in a long time, so bear with us. 
[01:26:00]  Are the nasty boys ever nice?  That's great.  Stupid Larry King.  Oh, he's just the worst.  Is there any more of actual him?  No, that's all we got really for today.  I'm sorry there, Ant.  Mm-hmm.  Vince, are the road warriors really from the future, where there has been an apocalyptic end? 
[01:26:30]  And various homosexuals ride motorcycles and get boomerangs in their head.  Let's go to Steve in Rochester.  Steve.  The home of Brother Weez.  What's up, Steve?  Yes, I see the big belts.  Most of the time, they're not even wearing pants, and there's their belt loops. 
[01:27:00]  They can put the belts through.  It's not a practical belt.  It's not practical.  Jesse from Jersey.  Jesse.  Hi, Vince.  Has it ever occurred to you to give Stone Cold Steve Austin a blanket?  Let's go to Jay in Rhode Island.  Jay.  See, it's just fun to do, even if it doesn't sound like him.  Yes, Jay.  Brett hit a man of heart.  How many assassinations has he completed?  And is he involved with Kennedy? 
[01:27:30]  Comment.  Greg in Baltimore.  Greg.  Yeah, I want to know if the junkyard dog got his rabies shot.  Chris, Long Island.  What happened to Owen Hart's heart?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, no, you didn't.  Wouldn't Steve Austin win every match being bionic?  Comment, Vince.  If he's bigger, stronger, and faster, did you build him that way? 
[01:28:00]  Ah.  I wish we had more, um, actual Larry King.  I'm sure we can find it.  He's such an idiot.  I'm sure we can find it.  Ooh.  Ooh, what's that?  Yellow.  Yellow.  Why would he have his ringer on?  I don't know.  And then answer it.  Oh, what's that?  We got, we might have one more here. 
[01:28:30]  Josh.  I'm not a dietician or a barber.  Josh in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, uh, I want to know, are the Hardy Boys still solving mysteries?  What about Nancy Drew?  Discuss.  Nancy Drew.  Is she a diva?  All right, this one's good.  Dan in Cleveland.  I was wondering, how gay is primetime Sam Oral Roberts?  Linger, linger. 
[01:29:00]  Lee, lee, lee, one day.  Very nice.  Lee, lee, lee, one day.  Nice.  All right, we got to get Nick DiPaolo in here.  Yeah.  You get it.  Larry's out of touch.  Yeah, I think they get it.  Do you get it?  Oh, good.  And we got Floyd, uh, Floyd Mayweather Jr., of course, coming in.  He's not going to get it, is he?  No, he's running a little late, but as soon as he gets here, we'll get him in here with  his entourage, because we don't want him to kick our ass.  People still coming up. 
[01:29:30]  Well, Dennis in South Carolina might have one.  Yes, Dennis.  How did you get the Lex Luger out of the Superman movie?  Lex Luger.  Where did Bruce the barber get his license to cut hair?  People are saying they hope this doesn't turn into the Halloween party with the entourage.  Oh, my God. 
[01:30:00]  Mm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are the bushwhackers actually landscapers?  They're just coming in like nuts now.  Mayweather?  Vince, it's not even April.  Well, cigars and scotch.  Yeah.  All right.  I think.  You think we're done?  Blood from a stone, my friend.  You think?  Yeah.  We got a little something, something that Tim put together. 
[01:30:30]  Listen.  Listen to this.  Hey, Fred Schneider here.  ONA Records proudly presents A Flock of Idiots.  80s New Way with Kenny, Rowland, and Steve.  Do you really want to hurt me?  Do you really want to make me cry?  You've heard of the three tenors.  Now it's the three tone-deaf messes singing the greatest hits of the greatest decade.  Touch with the ground.  I'm a hunter. 
[01:31:00]  I'm after you.  You'll swoon to Kenny's dulcet baritone.  Tarting Japanese.  I think I'm tarting Japanese.  I really think so.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  And Rowland will rock you hard.  He dance like a wave of emotion romance.  And then there's my favorite, Steve's uncanny Cindy Wilson impersonation.  Ken Roof Rusted.  Wow, that makes me tingle all over.  Call 800-F-U-LINE-1 to get your copy of A Flock of Idiots, 80s New Wave with Kenny, Rowland, and Steve. 
[01:31:30]  And as a bonus, if you call now, we'll throw in a date with an elderly, well-endowed radio superstar named Anthony.  Get it today.  That's actually Fred Schneider helping us out, though.  That's pretty cool.  B-52 is doing a new project, right?  Ooh.  Huh?  Really?  What?  He was a big star. 
[01:32:00]  Sure.  Can I see that?  What's wrong, Jimmy?  Nothing.  I just want to put it over here.  Oh, all right.  Hey!  Hey, Jimmy.  You worked hard on that one.  I know.  I want to put it back there so we didn't get lost.  Nick DiPaolo next.  Opie and Anthony.  This is Vince McMahon of the WWF, and you're listening to the greatest tag team in radio,  Opie and Anthony.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:32:30]  We got Nick DiPaolo in studio.  Very, very funny guy.  You playing, uh...  Caroline's tonight.  Oh, very good.  It's 8 o'clock.  So, that's something different, huh?  Jesus.  Next thing you know, I'll beat the comedy seller.  Phone number 877-212-01A.  We got, um...  Mr. Foggi, inventor of the blimp, or no?  You like that Larry King stuff?  Oh, I was crying.  Stupid Larry.  He's just the worst. 
[01:33:00]  Someone, uh, someone wrote on the Instant Feedback, uh...  Oh, where's that line?  Uh, Thomas...  Uh, Overbeck from Dallas.  The Undertaker.  Has he buried this bit yet?  Should it be buried?  Comment.  Phoenix, you're on the air.  Yeah, he, uh...  Wow.  Yeah, wow.  I guess they just lost track of when he became irrelevant.  Like, I see, Larry King, years ago, was the guy.  Like, he was the guy.  He had a talk show, and people went on there, and actually, he actually was able to ask them  questions that...  And people studied him, because they thought he was a great interviewer. 
[01:33:30]  But he wasn't.  He was stupid even when he had his marbles.  Yeah.  He really was.  Like, really dumb, basic questions.  Oh, yeah.  And now, though, he's just...  Now it doesn't even make any sense.  Well, I bet his writing's gonna go through the roof now.  Yeah, because he's crazy.  Because it's like watching a crazy guy.  Yeah, you want to see that.  My uncle's 79, and my uncle goes...  I remember last Thanksgiving, he goes, Larry King's just afraid to die, isn't he?  And my uncle's 79, he is...  It's like watching Peter Finch in Network, you're just hoping he'll shoot himself in  the air. 
[01:34:00]  So they're completely ludicrous.  Love Network.  Love it.  Hey, Dan in Jersey's got something for the show.  Dan?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Paul.  Yeah.  Paul, because...  Dan, Dan, start over.  We messed up.  I don't know what happened.  I'm gonna walkie-talkie.  Yeah.  Try again.  I was at the Devils game last week, and during the intermission, they had a musical chairs  game, and they actually had E-Rock down on the ice.  What?  A game of music.  Musical chairs.  E-Rock.  Were you playing musical chairs in a Devils game? 
[01:34:30]  How do we get this information from a caller?  Musical chairs?  E-Rock?  Yeah, it was a CBS promotion with the Devils.  So, uh...  What?  You were the big get?  Oh, you were...  Oh, we gotta go to the Devils game tonight.  They got E-Rock playing musical chairs.  I can't miss this.  E-Rock, Kevin James, and Ray Ramon.  Yeah, he went out in the first round, so...  Of course he did.  Funny. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  You lost the first round of musical chairs, fatso!  Did you fall through the ice?  He was left in the toilet to the high chair to the Zamboni.  He was like, there was more guys than there was chairs.  It wasn't fair.  You lost in the first round?  What happened?  Yeah.  There was an angry black gentleman who kind of elbowed me right into the ice, so...  Went flying off the...  At a hockey game?  I don't believe it. 
[01:35:30]  So you're saying you were assaulted.  I was elbowed and then shoved to the ice to get out of the big inflatable chair that they had set up.  What the hell was Eddie Griffin doing in New Jersey?  And you just fell on the ice?  You just thumped on the ice like a piece of raw beet and then left?  That's good.  Yeah, pretty much.  Eskimos hauled him away for his blubber.  How did they announce you?  Quit pushing that lamp oil around.  How did they announce you to the crowd?  They announced me E-Rock from the Opie and Anthony show on 92.3 K-Rock.  And what kind of applause did you get? 
[01:36:00]  It was about the same as the other people who were announced on there and randomly picked.  You got a little smattering.  Guy on the Zamboni beeped his horn twice.  You got the same reaction as some plumber from Jersey?  Most of the people leave during the intermission.  They go to the bars and get food and stuff, so half the seats were empty.  Oh, that's why.  Of course.  That's why.  Otherwise, you would have got a standing ovation.  Right.  Yeah.  You lost in the first round.  Physical chairs.  What do you mean inflatable chairs, too? 
[01:36:30]  How many were there?  There were four big inflatable flame chairs in the center of the ice.  And five people.  And five people.  Yeah, that's how that game works.  You got shoved to the ice.  Yeah.  It's just like life, isn't it?  You were also told that you couldn't win the prize?  Yeah.  Why?  CBS was providing the prize, so I was told you're not allowed to win, so you have to get out in the first round.  Oh, my God.  Then why did they have you?  Who was running this?  Elliot Spitzer?  That thing is rigged. 
[01:37:00]  Right?  Oh, damn.  So were you trying to say that you let the guy beat you?  Yeah.  I was supposed to lose.  I wasn't supposed to let the guy shove me onto the ice right out of the seat.  You should have pulled up Bruce Willis in Pulp Fiction.  Just won.  You know who the guy was?  Jeremiah Wright.  Steven S. from Bayshore writes, E-Rock had them empty the Zamboni so he could make a giant snow goal. 
[01:37:30]  We're doing a lot of exaggerated humor today.  Bear with us.  Yeah, what music was playing during the musical chair segment?  Oh, that I don't know.  You don't know?  You've got to know.  No, I seriously don't.  You weren't listening.  You really don't know, huh?  No.  All right.  Very nice.  I bet he does know.  Of course he does.  Because we'd play it and then he'd be all embarrassed.  We'd make him play.  Good.  One chair.  You and Pat Duffy.  Pat Duffy just goes, I'm in. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, he would just kill him.  Kill him.  Hip check.  All right.  Nick DiPaolo in studio.  Caroline's tonight.  What's happening in your world?  Anything?  Are you following this, the Clinton thing?  Hillary lying.  She's a lying sack.  What happened?  No.  Hillary?  Oh, yeah.  Under fire in Bosnia 12 years ago.  Somebody could miss that ass with a rifle.  Yeah.  No, sniper.  And those ankles.  Ricochet.  Killing three civilians. 
[01:38:30]  She's just a lying whore.  Yeah.  Just the Democrats.  I can't.  We went over it earlier, but we didn't talk about the Chelsea Clinton.  Good thing.  She needs a slap in her ugly face, though.  She went from okay to ugly.  What happened?  Okay.  When was she okay?  She went from troll to troll two.  Squared.  She started to take on the look of Hillary a bit.  Yeah, she is looking like a mom.  Yeah, but she was asked about Monica Lewinsky, and she wasn't happy about that.  The first time. 
[01:39:00]  Did you hear this?  Yeah, by a young fella, right?  Yeah.  At a college.  Listen.  Wow.  You're the first person, actually, that's ever asked me that question.  In the, I don't know, maybe 70 college campuses that I've now been to.  And I do not think that's any of your business.  Oh.  Chelsea Clinton said she didn't want that to be the last question, so she took one more.  What was the question?  I'll tell you what it was.  The kid asked, you know, because your mother, like, stuck by, you know, Bill during the whole 
[01:39:30]  Monica Lewinsky thing, and some people think that means she has bad judgment, so is that  going to hurt her?  It's a legitimate question.  Absolutely.  Of course it is.  Of course it is.  I'm tired of this coddling of Chelsea Clinton.  Oh, Jesus.  She's a mutt.  If she's going to be in the public eye, and you're going to go out and do 70 college campuses,  the fact that your mother stood there like a suburban idiot while your father embarrassed  her in front of the country is a legit question.  Yeah, all of a sudden that's off the, you know, you can't go near that.  And then go, don't go out, and, you know, don't put yourself out there. 
[01:40:00]  And she said it in such a snooty, you know.  Yeah, what a snot.  Like, how dare you?  That's the first time I've been asked that.  Exactly.  You think it's not the first time people have thought it, though?  Well, exactly.  They wanted to, but they're coddling her.  And it should be asked every time now.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Every time.  It should be.  She's just, you can tell she's brought up by a feminist scum.  That really is an irritating response.  If she would have just said, look, I'd rather not talk about it.  It's the arrogance.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, it is.  But he lied under oath, and he got caught, and, you know, he was embarrassed in front of 
[01:40:30]  the whole country.  I had that fight with my wife.  He saw it last night, the story.  Of course, she's like, that's none of their business, you know.  So I slept on the couch downstairs.  It certainly is.  It does show Hillary's judgment.  Yeah.  Because the bottom line is, if Elliot Spitzer getting a hooker in his private life, it shows his poor  judgment, then the way she handled a sexual crisis in her house should show her poor judgment.  It's absolutely relevant.  You can't do that today, Jim.  You can't show a woman in a negative light.  But, you know, they crap ice cream and sherbet.  You can't do it.  I'm not even going to disagree with that.  You can't portray him in a negative light, whether it's a goddamn sitcom or real life. 
[01:41:00]  It is ridiculous.  She was so snooty about it.  I loved your reference, but it turned on little Jimmy over there.  I mean, yeah.  Because he actually does think it's sherbet ice cream.  Yeah.  Geez.  Perhaps a gelato with something certain ethnicity.  I know.  That was the wrong guy to say that to him.  Yeah, really.  I mean, Jimmy's...  It was quite brilliant, but...  His pillowcase is like 51 flavors.  And you got Spitzer linked to another call girl ring. 
[01:41:30]  That's the front page of our paper today.  Yeah.  Why is that shocking?  It's like you found out he bought his shoes at Tom McKinnon and Faber.  Who cares?  Yeah, like it was the first time and last time he ever did anything like that.  It's another whore shop.  Yeah.  The guy was how old?  Of course he's done this before.  When did the guy have time to govern?  Because now there's this busty blonde who's...  I know.  She kind of looks like Courtney Love.  It's like a tranny version of Courtney Love.  Oh, my God.  She's claiming that not only did he use her services as far as the escort company goes 
[01:42:00]  or whatever, she did it herself a few times to Mr. Spitzer.  Was he wearing those black socks pulled up to his knees?  What a creep.  He was all...  He couldn't even get his pants off.  He was so turned out by these young chicks.  He just had to leave a sock.  He just jumped in with his pants around his ankle.  That's it.  Yeah.  That's why they call it the Emperor's Club because your penguin walked to the bathroom.  Get rid of those ribs.  Let's say hi to David in PA.  David.  Hey.  Hey. 
[01:42:30]  Of course music during E-Rock's promotion was Baby Elephant Walk.  Oh.  Poor E-Rock.  Yeah.  And you know what?  The Hillary Clinton thing is really annoying me.  It wouldn't be anybody's business if she had just stayed out of public life.  But she wants to be elected as president.  Everything is on the table.  Fair game.  Everything.  Sure.  Yeah.  Oh, I just...  That whole family makes me sick.  But you would get a picture with Bill.  In a second.  Yeah.  Of course.  I'd sell out the Republicans in a second. 
[01:43:00]  I actually like Obama, but I mean, you know, he's Hillary.  Do you?  How do you feel that now two people you know have gotten their picture taken with Bill  Clinton?  Does that bother you?  More than two.  I mean, one guy I know sat in the Oval Office with Bill Clinton and worked out jokes with him.  Who?  Daryl Hammond.  Wow.  Daryl has Clinton's story.  He knows Clinton.  Oh, right.  And he's performed for Bush.  He's performed for Congress, the Senate.  I got a picture of the president.  Oh.  Jimmy Carter.  Really?  Wow.  That doesn't really clear.  I keep it behind my picture of me and Richie April from The Sopranos. 
[01:43:30]  I swear to God, it's on my mantle at home.  It's behind me, Richie April on The Sopranos.  I did a Tonight Show.  Jimmy Carter was on there.  I was wondering.  I thought maybe it was a rally you were being dragged out of.  He goes, send me one of your CDs.  I'm like, yeah, you'll really enjoy the C word three times.  I had a Christmas card from Richard Milhouse Nixon.  You're kidding.  Yeah.  When we were in school, little tater, little kids, they made us write Christmas cards to 
[01:44:00]  the president.  And we did that, and he sent one back.  No, he didn't.  Yes, he did.  No, he didn't.  Somebody else signed him.  Just to you or the whole class?  I know it wasn't really him.  That was your dad, so you wouldn't cry again.  No.  He never wrote me back, Daddy.  It was a stamped signature.  Oh, was it?  Yeah.  So it was like his signature, but it was a stamp.  Dear douche, Merry Christmas.  That's very ironic, because I got a birthday card from Sparrow Agnew. 
[01:44:30]  Really?  Really?  Sparrow Agnew.  That's right.  His vice president.  Yes.  I got a good luck with that headache card from Lyndon Johnson.  Hey, before we move on from politics, and we got Mayweather Jr. coming in.  Floyd Mayweather Jr. coming in in a few minutes with his entourage.  We played this earlier, Nick.  I want to get your comment on this.  There's a guy.  He's going to be a YouTube sensation by the end of the day, I'm thinking. 
[01:45:00]  I got turned on to this video yesterday.  Larry Sinclair, he's telling this outrageous Barack Obama story, but he wants to make an  official video.  So he's very serious, and he made this video with cars going by outside, and he posted it  on YouTube.  Larry Sinclair?  Yeah.  Where does he live?  He's from Illinois, it looks like.  He's a limo driver.  He's got some outrageous accusations about him and Barack Obama.  Oh, okay.  Listen to this. 
[01:45:30]  Hi, my name is Larry Sinclair.  I'm making this video and posting it on YouTube because of an incident involving myself and  Senator Barack Obama.  It's just all official.  I love how official he is.  He sounds very gay, doesn't he?  He sounds a little effeminate.  Well, it's not that there's anything right with that.  He's been hit with the sword of the gay.  Yep.  Right across the cheek.  Barack Obama. 
[01:46:00]  Between November 3rd and November 8th of 1999 in the Chicago, Illinois area, the mainstream  media and Obama himself has done greatly to prevent this story from becoming public.  During those time periods.  What do they do?  Ignore you.  Daring.  Not during.  Daring.  He's nervous by himself in his own room making a film.  Imagine if this is just all true.  No one's going to believe the guy.  No one's going to believe him because he just sounds like a nut. 
[01:46:30]  He's sitting there like, I got gold.  Yeah.  I'm finally going to release it.  Here it is on YouTube.  Here's my big confession.  Right.  It's going to bust things wide open.  Huge scandal with Obama.  And people watch and go, ah, he's a kook.  Yeah.  Greatly to prevent this story from becoming public.  During those time periods in 1999, I met Obama at an upscale lounge in Chicago, Illinois.  After having a few drinks, Obama and I left in my limo, began to drink. 
[01:47:00]  Mr. Obama acquired powder cocaine for my use, crack cocaine for his use.  I performed sex.  Crack goes better with chicken.  Oh, no.  He must have had the beef.  This guy.  He's saying he serviced Obama in the limo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  After having some coke.  Well, I'm working in Chicago in April.  I wonder if he still has a limo service.  That'd be nice on the way to the airport.  Kenny, get up front.  Keep your mouth shut.  Okay. 
[01:47:30]  He then ejaculated on my pants when I was shopping.  You know what?  I'll do that for you, Jimmy.  This guy.  Go ahead.  Anything else?  Continue.  Oh, yeah.  It's great.  Oh, there's more?  Oh, I love this guy.  Really?  This guy is a hoot.  I powered cocaine for my use, crack cocaine for his use.  I performed sex on Senator Obama, who at the time was a state representative for the state of Illinois.  Well, thanks for his resume.  Mr. Obama knows these allegations to be true. 
[01:48:00]  I'm challenging Mr. Obama to come forth, be honest, stop claiming that his drug use is limited to his teenage years.  1999, you weren't a teenager.  1999, you were a state representative for the people of the state of Illinois.  1999, I performed sex on you in the back of my limo, as well as in my hotel room in Gurney, Illinois, two days later.  Gurney.  Gurney.  If you challenge the authenticity of this allegation, I challenge you to take a polygraph test, as I will submit to as well. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, go on that Fox show.  These allegations are true and need to be told to the public.  Let the public decide whether Mr. Obama is being forthright and honest.  Boo!  I believe this guy.  Yeah?  I absolutely believe him, but I think he's nuts, and I obviously don't think it was Barack Obama, but I really think that he believes.  Who was it?  Flip Wilson?  Oh, in 99, I could have been sucking it.  Oh, that's right.  Flip Wilson.  It was Fred Armisen from SNL. 
[01:49:00]  No, I think that he thinks it was him.  I really do.  I'll tell you why.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Why do you rule out that it's not true?  Oh, possible it is.  But I mean, I'm not saying it is possible.  But either way, I think this guy believes it.  Because he's saying things like, he's almost like, look, we both know this is true.  And he's saying like two days later, it's just some weird little specific in that.  So you think this guy got bamboozled?  This is very easy.  Thought he was servicing Obama?  Very easy solution.  Describe Obama's private part. 
[01:49:30]  Like they did Michael Jackson.  Michael Jackson.  Right.  Yes.  They might not have a distinguishing mark.  Oh, I'm sure he does.  Yeah.  They all brand themselves down there.  Distinguishing mark.  He stubbed it on the sidewalk.  He's got a Dallas Cowboys logo, I heard.  And his left nut.  I don't know why Dallas.  That was so stupid.  Well, no, it would have been the Bulls or.  Yeah, it would have been a Chicago team.  Bears.  This guy, you know what's funny?  You can tell this guy's a crack. 
[01:50:00]  Because you can see John McCain walking by his window while he's making his name.  Probably McCain put this out there, too.  Yeah, this seems like a, I don't know, maybe he's got ulterior motives.  No, I think he's just nuts.  You think he's just crazy?  He's just nuts.  I think this is going to make like the mainstream news.  Will this be on like 5 o'clock tonight?  A sex scandal?  Yeah, do you think?  Sex and drug scandal involving Obama?  We'll tell you about it.  No.  No.  You don't think it'll make like Larry King?  It'll be huge.  What do you think? 
[01:50:30]  It'll be huge on YouTube today, but that's about it.  This guy will be more famous.  Yeah.  After 21 years of playing the club, this guy's already more famous than me because of this.  This guy's nuts.  We're trying to get him on the show.  Get him in here.  I think we got to his lawyer so far, and we might be able to get him on.  Get him in here and get him a limo.  Let me get the back of it.  Get him a lie detector test.  We'll do the lie detector test.  How great would that be?  Fantastic.  We're all sitting here with rods.  I think we could throw another quickie in here before we take a break.  When Richard Long couldn't put two holes in his wall to install his satellite TV system, 
[01:51:00]  he turned to his handgun.  Richard Long.  Long shot the holes in the wall, but the shots went all the way through to the outside,  where his wife was standing in the yard.  And Patsy Long died from a gunshot.  Wait a minute.  Good.  Oh, he's a genius.  Oh, that's beautiful.  Wait a minute.  He's a genius.  He's going to get off.  It was an accident.  All right.  Um, honey, you stand here.  I'm going to go inside.  No, right here.  Where's the hammer? 
[01:51:30]  Oh, forget it.  Don't move.  All right.  There we go.  All right.  Now I'll finish my job.  What was he doing?  He was hanging something?  I went back a little bit.  Let's listen to this again.  Yeah, where was it where they're using firearms as tools?  Then he asked his kids to stand in.  Does this look straight?  Yeah.  Is this good?  Looks like daddy's freezer bird.  What was he doing, Ope?  We're going to start this one already. 
[01:52:00]  Jesus, I'm out of bullets and I got one kid left.  I was digging a pool.  Good time to hang that wall mirror.  Somebody call Aunt Lily.  When Richard Long couldn't put two holes in his wall to install his satellite TV system,  he turned to his handgun.  Long shot the holes in the wall, but the shots went all the way through.  To the outside, where his wife was standing in the yard.  Patsy Long died from a gunshot wound to the chest.  It was the second shot her husband fired. 
[01:52:30]  Tragic accident.  You know, bad things happen to good people.  Officials in Sedalia, Missouri are investigating and say they haven't decided if Long will face charges in the death.  He didn't realize that she was outside, had no clue that she was out there.  He says this type of case would usually result in manslaughter charges, but that decision is up to the prosecutor's office.  Neighbors also died laughing.  22, huh?  Jesus.  Wow. 
[01:53:00]  So he was probably trying to hang something on the outside of the wall, or maybe run wires through or something.  Whatever.  There's drills for that.  Yeah.  It could use like a drill bit.  Oh, that takes too much time.  Ah, screw it.  Get the gun out.  You can't kill the wife with a drill.  Unless she's like Lethal Weapon 2, standing up against the outside of the wall.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  What was she doing in the yard, anyway?  Yeah, yeah.  Look at that detail.  Was she just standing there, really? 
[01:53:30]  Standing right in front of where he's going to be shooting through the wall.  She's like, just eyeing it for him.  Yeah, that looks about right.  Yeah, eyeball that for me, could you?  He's just got a silhouette of her painted on the wall.  Head pops off like Kennedy.  Perfect.  First thing he sees on the satellite system is the news with him killing his wife.  How ironic.  In HD.  That's great.  Yeah, in wonderful HD.  Wonderful HD. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, jeez.  I wonder what idiot did this.  Oh, wait.  There's a place in my yard.  Chester's Liver from Whack Bag writes, it's regular Joe, the captain of the police, saying  bad things happen to good people.  That's how the cookie crumbles.  Yeah.  Who said she was good people?  I know.  She might have been a real chooch.  She's got every right.  You know?  She could have been a real a-hole.  We might be laughing at the wrong person here.  I'm just saying.  I'm not saying it's true, but she could have been a real jerk, too.  I don't know.  Good people, huh? 
[01:54:30]  Not that she deserved that, but...  He was a good person.  Hmm.  Maybe.  They're all stupid, though.  I'll say that.  Was he using the gun as an actual tool, or was he pissed like I, when I can't do something,  I get pissed?  You just shoot it.  I have been known to shoot things when I get mad at them.  Wow.  I've shot my computer.  Oh, was he actually using it as a drill?  Do you see what I'm saying?  Yeah, I think he was trying to use it as a drill.  Well, but at least, you know, I back up my targets, and I shoot in the basement.  I'm a witness. 
[01:55:00]  I'm here to say it's as true as he told it.  That goddamn computer was really pissing me off, so I took it downstairs and put a nice  .223 through it.  You're real?  Yes, he did.  See, I love him.  That's a true Italian...  That's fantastic.  Yeah, just pull out the weapons.  All evidence has been removed, but I was lucky enough to see it.  Randy, Illinois, what's up?  Hey, boys, what's going on?  Hey.  I love your stuff, man.  Thanks. 
[01:55:30]  Want to let you guys know that satellite systems are usually set up on the outside of...  What in the hell was this guy doing on the outside of the house, set up a ditch?  Punch it out.  Love you guys.  Well, I obviously want to run some wires from the outside to the inside.  Yeah, maybe you wanted to do that.  Needed some holes in there.  I prefer to use a larger caliber weapon when running wires through my wall, though.  I'd use .45 or something like that.  22.  Jesus.  Cannonball.  All right, we're going to take a break. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, it's a cannonball.  He shot a cannon into his wife's head.  We've got to take a break.  We've got Floyd Mayweather Jr. joining the show next.  Is he always here?  I believe so.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Call the Opie and Anthony show.  866.  Wow, 1, wow.  866.  Wow, 1, wow.  Cell phone and PDA users, send your message to feedback at opiananthony.com.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Waiting for Floyd Mayweather Jr. to stop on by and say hi.  We also have Nick DiPaolo in studio. 
[01:56:30]  Hi.  A very bitter and very funny man.  Why am I bitter?  I don't know.  He's a realist.  I've been like this since I was six.  Really?  Oh, yes.  He's been called bitter in first grade.  Really?  I don't even know the word yet.  It's on his report card.  He's bitter.  Your parents got to read.  He's bitter.  Yeah, bitter.  Where did it all go wrong for you, Nick?  I don't know that it has opened.  Brown versus Board of Education. 
[01:57:00]  Norton said that.  Wow.  Wait till Mayweather shows up.  Jimmy Norton said that.  Yeah.  And his entourage.  Get your ass handed to you.  Nick.  That was pretty accurate though, Jimmy.  That was pretty funny.  Nick is extremely funny.  He's playing Caroline's tonight here in New York City.  Go to nickdip.com, by the way.  That's one word.  Nickdip.com.  Yeah, you can pick up Nick DiPaolo hip boots and hats.  And the number for Caroline's.  212-757-4100. 
[01:57:30]  That's not the number I was going to give out.  What?  Nope.  Oh, no.  What is it?  212-757-4100.  I like saying 4100.  Me too.  Sounds cooler.  I call it 41 double goose eggs.  Wow.  Ooh.  You're a rebel.  Yeah.  I'm taking a crack.  Eight o'clock.  Yes, you do.  You guys heard about the cheerleader, right?  The cheerleader?  Oh, yeah, that's kind of sad cases.  Dummy.  Is that the one that?  One was bigger than the other?  Gave Obama a zing zangler?  The male cheerleader from Illinois? 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  Give me a little.  I was then.  From Gurney.  He got in my limo with me.  In Gurney.  In Gurney.  In Gurney.  In a hotel room in Gurney.  That must have been some hotel.  During the 80s.  What a ghoul.  Students at a high school in Boca Raton are grieving the loss of a popular cheerleader.  She died during a breast augmentation surgery.  Now, these surgical procedures are done every day and increasingly on teenagers.  No one could have imagined the outcome of this plastic surgery procedure. 
[01:58:30]  Stephanie Kaliva is described as a bright student, college-bound, someone who was working  her way through high school.  You can tell what she meant to everyone from the flowers that have been left here on the  fence at West Boca Raton High School, where she was going to graduate later this year.  She was the best and the brightest.  18-year-old Stephanie Kaliva died over the weekend from complications during a cosmetic  surgery procedure.  Her friends are devastated.  It's just sad to see her go, because she's a wonderful person, smart. 
[01:59:00]  She had a lot of talent.  She sounds very devastated.  Kaliva had the surgery at this Boca Raton Surgical Center and had a devastating reaction  to the anesthesia because of an underlying medical condition.  You can see the pom-poms and the shirt left by her cheerleading classmate.  She was captain of the high school cheerleading team here.  Yeah.  Tragic story.  Tragic, really.  Yeah.  Well, a lot of the moms out there are getting the breast implants for their daughters before 
[01:59:30]  they even leave high school.  Yeah.  They were trying to blame it.  I was watching Fox last night.  Laura Ingraham, whatever.  She was trying to blame it on guys.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Let me get it, because I know exactly what it is.  Of course.  That the image that is put out there, these young women, are seeing this because the men  put this image out there and want to attain these women, and then they do this to themselves.  Yeah.  That was the...  And I like Laura Ingraham, usually, but...  Really?  She was way off on this one.  It's phony, because I prefer real, and it's idiotic to blame... 
[02:00:00]  Stop blaming men.  Stop it.  What do you think we think of Matthew McConaughey?  Exactly, man.  It's just...  You're telling me that I've got to be rich, or I've got to be powerful in order to bang  you.  Sorry, ladies.  We don't judge your social status as heavily as you judge ours, and you don't judge our  looks as heavily as we judge yours.  That's the reality of it.  It's a social thing with us.  You want our attention.  That's why you did it.  Yes.  Some type of self-esteem issue.  I didn't create that.  I just met you last night in the club. 
[02:00:30]  It's not my fault.  Exactly.  I didn't create the self-esteem issue.  I just use it to my advantage.  Yeah.  Leave something on your back.  Exactly.  Your uncle created it with a millilite bottle.  I think that can get through, can't it?  Why not?  Why not?  Of course.  I want to keep a bit alive.  Thomas Overbeck from Dallas helping us out.  I guess God needed a cheerleader.  Ah.  Yeah.  God was...  He's been busy because he wanted a McMuffin.  I guess God needed a McMuffin.  Needed an Egg McMuffin.  Because the Egg McMuffin dude died and now he gets a cheerleader today as well. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  It's not a bad day for God.  And he got Richard Widmark.  Oh, I thought was dead.  Did he die at Widmark?  Yeah.  I swear I would have bet he was dead.  And he just died.  Why do we not have clips of Richard Widmark?  Richard Widmark.  Can we have...  You gotta have some...  I'll be gone tomorrow, but you gotta have clips of...  You know what I do to squeal is?  Oh, I love that.  You lying old hag.  I love how he pushes the old broad down the stairs in the wheelchair.  I peed on his star on the Walk of Fame.  There's a little tribute.  I had to pee.  It's a very famous scene of what we call Kiss of Death with Victor Mature. 
[02:01:30]  And women were women back then.  Oh, Nick!  You know, these idiots.  And he shows up and Widmark is looking for this snitch.  So he goes to the guy's old mother who's in a wheelchair.  And she's like, a Pieta's not here.  And he goes, you lying old hag.  And he takes a cord out of the wall.  And he wraps her up in the wheelchair.  And he just laughs as he rolls her down a flight of stairs.  That's a great scene.  You lying old hag.  Would they ever do that today?  Ever.  Oh, my God. 
[02:02:00]  No.  They would do it to a guy, right?  Oh, absolutely.  A guy dressed up like an old lady.  And he's laughing though.  He's so happy to be doing that.  That's what he was known for.  It says in the article.  Yeah, that sick laugh that he had.  What a great sociopath he was.  Yeah.  A great line.  The prosecutor comes to ask, are you going to talk now, Tommy?  Because back then they were all like that.  And he's like, I wouldn't give you the skin off a grape.  It's the greatest.  What?  Oh.  Well, the writing has improved at least.  Yeah.  Skin off a grape.  Oh, I would love to say that to someone and mean it. 
[02:02:30]  Like, that was tough talk back then.  Yeah.  Say it to a heckle, Jim.  I love the women, though.  Like, you were saying that.  Oh, come on now.  Come on, guys.  But she was just this doting idiot.  Yeah.  Older, Victor, mature had the two daughters.  I got to see my daughter.  Oh, Nick!  No matter what he did, she loved him.  What was the movie Jimmy McCagney shoved a grapefruit in a woman's face?  Yeah, that was a good one.  I don't know, but I love it.  You haven't seen that?  I don't know.  Just mushed a half a grapefruit. 
[02:03:00]  I don't know what it was.  Picked it up and mushed it right in her face.  He goes, I wish you was a wishing well or something.  Then I'd dump you down the hand.  She sticks a grapefruit in her face like this.  She just hit, pushes it in her face and turns it like three.  It was like a hateful look on his face.  Was it breakfast at Tiffany's?  It's not the angel with dirty faces, is it?  I don't know.  It's a famous scene, though.  I wish you were a wishing well or something like that.  Then I'd dump you down the...  Here's the scene.  Public Enemy, yes.  It's from Public Enemy.  Public Enemy, okay.  Look at his hair doing it.  He rules.  And that's...  Yeah, who is that? 
[02:03:30]  Can you do the audio from that?  No, you can't play it.  Yeah, we're not allowed to.  Yeah.  Yeah, see?  Oh, wow.  That was the old days.  I thought you were Mayweather.  It's just that.  Just a tall white guy.  Right.  Exactly.  It's Fairweather.  It's Fairweather.  All right.  You must start at the beginning of the movie.  There's a credits are rolling.  Yeah, really.  There he goes.  That's like a punch in the face.  You know what?  He's not acting right now.  He's really enjoying filming that scene.  He just annoyed her on set.  Yeah, well...  Hey, show that on The Sopranos. 
[02:04:00]  Tony's watching that and laughing.  Then he starts laughing.  Yeah, he's sitting in his feet laughing.  Look up Kiss of Death.  Kiss of Death.  Windwalk and see if he's in there.  There's also the greatest slap ever captured  is he slaps this fat man named Luigi in the face  because the guy, Nick, is in there  and he's like,  get the deluxe short dinner for my pal.  And he's not friends with him.  He wants to kill him.  And he goes,  but Mr. Udo, the kitchen is closed.  And he stands up  and it's the sleekest face slap.  Me and my friend watched it.  We must have rewired it nine times.  You've never seen a better slap. 
[02:04:30]  That's great.  There's a crispy slap to the face.  That's when they made movies.  Look at the old school wheelchair.  My God.  Oh, yeah.  We'll get these links up on onaradio.com later.  He pulls the cord.  He's got a suit on,  a great hat.  That hat should be on a giraffe.  Blah, blah.  An hour and a half.  But why does he,  what is he going to do with the cord, really?  He's tying her in the wheelchair.  Why does he have to tie her up?  She's already in a wheelchair.  No.  Because she could use her arms maybe  to like help herself down the stairs.  He doesn't want her.  He put her in the wheelchair 
[02:05:00]  by trying to hang a shelf with a gun.  Look, you've never seen it.  Look, he's holding, opening the door.  He opens the door angrily  and oh, this bitch is going down the steps.  You've never seen a happier mug.  Look at him.  And she's screaming.  Oh my God.  How did I miss this movie?  You've never seen this scene?  That's fantastic.  Right down the step.  And he just goes,  you lying old hag.  She does an endo.  I hope she was all right.  Yeah.  Boy, did she take a tumble.  You can't paralyze. 
[02:05:30]  Somebody's already paralyzed.  No.  Can we get the audio from this scene?  She's dead.  But you can't even make that.  Somebody in the back office.  Let's go.  You can't even make that look like an accident  because he tied her up with cord.  They should do that to Larry King.  Throw a wig on him.  Michael Madsen was talking about that scene  when he was in?  Oh yeah, I think so.  Chris Coe was telling us?  Okay.  Michael Madsen was one of the greatest interviews  we've ever done.  I love that guy.  He's really funny.  He was amazing.  Do we have any Michael Madsen stories?  I got one.  You got one? 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  Iraq, you got any of those clips too?  He's like an intimidating,  he plays a good badass.  Yeah.  And I used to go to the gym in LA  and I went down to the parking lot,  the underground parking lot to get my car  and I see him trying to pull out  in his SUV and his wife  or his girlfriend's outside  telling him how much clearance he had.  Oh no.  So I go to him like this,  I go like this, you know,  with a hand gesture saying  he's got like a couple inches,  he just gives me this dirty look.  Like he wanted to punch my face.  I go, you get this much.  Just that hateful look that he had in Donnie Brasco. 
[02:06:30]  Eyebrow furled, I went, ugh.  Just got my car.  He came in to do the show  and I'm like, hey, I'm Opie.  And he just looks at me and just starts laughing.  Like, thanks, man.  I know it's a dumb name,  but help me out here a little bit.  Plays a great heavy though.  Oh, he's fantastic.  Love him, man.  He's got a website.  Hates Hollywood.  How does that website go again?  He lists all his projects.  He lists every movie he's done.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he rates his own movies  and then tells you why he did the movie.  My wife told me.  Like, must see.  And then there's kind of, you know, 
[02:07:00]  see him if you want to.  And then there's ones that you should just not see  because they suck.  Needed the money.  Yeah.  He puts them on there.  Oh, damn.  Hey.  Hey.  She talked to us back now.  What's up, Nick?  Oh, wow.  We got to behave.  Are you kidding me?  How are you, sir?  Good morning.  Floyd Mayweather Jr. has joined the show.  It's Money Mayweather, baby.  Floyd Money Mayweather.  Well, where's the money?  We saw you throwing it out at the Hard Rock Cafe yesterday.  We thought you'd have a few for us today. 
[02:07:30]  And it's not Junior, for those that don't know.  No, it isn't Junior?  Never been Junior.  I never said it.  Jimmy was saying Junior all morning.  I don't matter.  What's up, baby?  Talk to me.  Why don't I say Junior?  So, all right.  You're in WrestleMania.  This guy has got you by 16 inches and 282 pounds.  Woo!  Big boy.  Big boy.  Yeah, you're fighting the big show, WrestleMania, on Sunday.  He's, yeah, seven foot tall.  And you're, I'm not even going to say how tall you are.  5'8".  That might make him mad.  I don't know.  I'll tell you right now.  Is it 5'8", 158? 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, 5'8", 158.  That's me.  Absolutely.  How did they approach you about doing this?  No, what happened was, honestly, I was just, I've always been a fan of wrestling, you know,  from the 80s.  But now my two boys are fans of wrestling, my two sons, 9 and 7.  So, I got invited to No Way Out.  And then, somehow, when I was at the wrestling match, the guy called me.  I'm like, I'm just here to watch wrestling.  So, I jumped over and got in the ring and punched him in the face, gave him, broke his nose, 
[02:08:30]  gave him two black eyes.  I went to the back.  They said, what do you think about getting into wrestling?  I said, it is what it is.  And the guy said, he challenged me in wrestling.  He asked me to, so next time I went out, they asked me to, he asked me to, I want to face  him in WrestleMania.  The big show, I said, absolutely.  So, that's how I got involved with wrestling.  Are you actually going to wrestle, or are you going to make him put gloves on?  Like, are you going to let this monster grab you?  This is a no-holds-bars match.  This is a little different from every other match that's ever been held, you know, in  WrestleMania.  Everything goes. 
[02:09:00]  Why would you do that?  Really?  You're undefeated.  You're 39-0.  I mean, you're fighting De La Hoya again since September.  Why would you get into the ring with something this large?  Why don't you just bite him?  Why not?  We must see Sunday.  Is the wrist worth the reward?  I mean, win, lose, or draw.  I mean, we don't mind taking risk.  You know, I mean, all the risk I've took thus far, look at the reward.  So, I feel it was worth it.  So, you're going to actually punch him? 
[02:09:30]  Will you be using your skills?  I'd imagine he's going to, like, go after his package and use it like a speed bag.  Because I'm thinking, you know, it's going to be hard to get inside on a big guy like  that without him just grabbing you like a grizzly bear.  Well, you know, I've been practicing with my big man over there.  Oh, yeah, man.  How tall are you?  Wow.  He's like 7'1".  Holy...  7'1"?  Is he real?  Yeah, 7'1".  Is he real?  No, he's actually 7'4".  No, he's taller than 7'4".  Easy.  Yeah.  Oh, hell yeah. 
[02:10:00]  That's one of my securities.  So, you know, we've been practicing.  We've been working.  I've been working with some wrestling coaches.  Of course, my boxing coach, strength and conditioning coach, Leonard Ellby, also my advisor sitting  next to me.  So, everything has been going great and tremendous preparing for, you know, preparing for WrestleMania  24.  How's Vince?  Isn't he like a lunatic?  No, great guy.  You like Vince?  Great.  Everything first class service, just like we like it.  Get in there and mix it up.  Oh, man.  I love Vince. 
[02:10:30]  He's the best.  Genius.  They declared you, Ring Magazine called you the greatest fighter, pound for pound in the  world.  How many times have you switched weight classes and how many, I mean, you keep switching  and you just keep winning the title and then you're bored and you switch again.  How many switches have you made and how many have you won?  Since, I think I've been world champion like a decade now.  Wow.  Yeah.  So, I beat the best at 130, moved to 135, beat the best.  Moody 140, beat the best.  Moody 147, beat two of the best, then went to 54, beat Oscar, went back down to 54. 
[02:11:00]  I mean, went back down to 47 and, I mean, Ricky hadn't had, you know, one hell of a fight  and now I'm in WrestleMania.  Well, Delahoy, you're fighting again in September.  I mean, obviously, he's had his problems.  Is that fight still on?  I mean, is that, you know, when you guys trash talk before the fight, that'd be a great  one to use.  It certainly would.  Well, you know, the thing with Delahoy, the first time we fought.  The fans wanted to see a knockout. 
[02:11:30]  It's the thing that they, it's something always in the game, which Delahoy gave me heavyweight  gloves the first time we fought.  You know, everything was, it was, you know, geared towards his way.  He wanted, he chose the gloves, he chose the sight, and he chose the weight class.  But, you know, a lot of fans don't know that they would have got a lot more action if  I had the right gloves I was supposed to have.  You know, he had, he said, well, Mayweather needs to wear these gloves, but the gloves  he gave me was heavyweight gloves.  So, I mean, yeah, let's both put on the right gloves and we can really get it on, we can  really mix it up. 
[02:12:00]  Well, how does that work?  I didn't know, are they allowed to choose your gloves or, I don't know, how does it work?  Well, I'm supposed to choose my own gloves.  He's supposed to choose his own gloves.  But the gloves that he gave me was heavyweight gloves, I'm just being honest.  And he was wearing some silk ones up to the elbow.  It's possible.  It's possible.  And just like 24-7, like I told everybody, I said, this guy is basically fooling everybody.  I said, the truth will soon, you know, everything about Delahoy will come out.  And, you know, at the end of 07, everybody had a chance to see. 
[02:12:30]  It came out.  Lloyd, who's top of Hatton or Delahoy?  Um, Hatton's probably more rugged, but Delahoy's more of a technician.  Got better skills.  Hatton's just a straight up brawler, come in, face first, don't care.  Jeez.  It is what it is.  However it plays out is how it plays out.  You've had a lot to say about the MMA and the MMA fighters, right?  I just said that boxing was first. 
[02:13:00]  We laid the groundwork.  So, every other sport that comes along that's contact should respect who laid the groundwork,  which is boxing, the sport that I come from.  No disrespect to no mixed martial arts or no fight clubs or nothing of that nature.  But you must realize, I don't know no other fighter that's in mixed martial arts that's making 30 and 50 million a pop.  Yeah, they're not the draw.  I mean, the pay-per-views they do can't do anything with boxing. 
[02:13:30]  I mean, last year, you know, me, myself, with the great help of, of course, HBO, you know, the vehicle, who helped get me to this point.  But not just HBO, but Leonard Ellerbee, Al Hammond, and my whole team, who helped me get to this point, has truly, truly been a blessing.  I mean, because, you know, anytime you call, of course, you see the quotes that's in the newspaper, anytime you call Mr. Ellerbee's phone, you know, if you ain't calling for 20 million and up, don't call at all. 
[02:14:00]  And it's really, the number's really higher than 20 million.  We just say 20 million just, you know, just to keep it at a low.  What do you want to, you're trying to kind of like, just keep it like humble.  That's 20 million.  Yeah, you know.  That's a nice problem to have, 20 million and up.  You got some water for...  You're, uh, you're, uh, undefeated, right?  Yes, sir.  Uh, who, have you ever been rocked where you went like, uh-oh, I think I'm, I think I'm rocked.  And, uh, uh, obviously pulled out of it, but...  I've been hit with a good punch before, and I said, are you sure I chose this to be my job? 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  And so, you know...  You never thought you were in jeopardy, though, of maybe, like, wow, I'm, I'm kind of in trouble over here?  No, absolutely not.  I just, I'm, I'm, I'm instilling boxing to clean the sport up.  We got Mayweather Promotions to clean the sport up.  We gonna, we moving on, we, we also do business with, uh, the, the mixed martial arts and, um, UFC and things of that nature, you know?  But boxing comes first.  Boxing comes first.  And, uh, there's not a bigger or better promotion company than Mayweather Promotions. 
[02:15:00]  The reason why I'm, I'm right where I'm at today and on this plateau is because of, uh,  self-promotion.  And can't nobody sell, uh, uh, Floyd Money Mayweather better than, better than Floyd Money Mayweather.  Are you tempted to get into, because Tyson had talked about getting involved with the MMA.  It was talked about for a little while, then he kind of stopped for whatever reason.  Is that something that interests you at all?  Or are you just...  Well, me and myself, I'm, I'm, you know, I'm, I'm a lot older and a lot smarter, more mature now. 
[02:15:30]  Um, um, I look at everything as, as a businessman.  Honestly, as a businessman, you know, we look forward to just making major moves.  Any move we make, we want it to be major.  Nothing small.  Everything major.  Are you guys the headline fight at, uh, at WrestleMania?  It's gotta be, uh, it's gotta be.  Like I said before, there's no promoter bigger than Floyd Money Mayweather.  At first, I was just a preliminary bout that was on the card.  Now I'm the main event.  And just like, uh, yesterday, when you went to the press conference, no disrespect to the other wrestlers. 
[02:16:00]  Um, I got, I, I have the utmost respect for the other wrestlers, but when you left, when you left the, when you left the press conference,  there's only one name you thought about.  There's only one face you thought about.  Because I'm outside the box.  And that's what we try to do.  We try to be outside the box.  What Mayweather promotion brings to the table, we try to make the impossible possible.  We also, we're doing, uh, the, the Jay-Z and, uh, Mary-Jay tour.  We've done the Beyonce tour. 
[02:16:30]  Uh, we've done the Chris Brown and Bawar tour.  So we, Mayweather promotions are doing so many different things.  Getting involved in so many other fields is, is truly a blessing.  Now being a professional fighter and a champion, I mean, you obviously have to like kind of hold back if people try you in public.  Um, when's the last time you had an altercation that was something that, you understand what I mean?  Like the reason I don't hit people in public is because I'm not a particularly good fighter.  So I was probably getting knocked out a lot.  What stops you from doing it?  That would just feel so good to be able to walk into a bar and knock anybody's team. 
[02:17:00]  No, we can't.  Well, well, last time I got into an altercation where I was Big Show, actually.  Oh yeah.  That was legit, huh?  Oh yeah.  It felt good.  Yeah, he, you know, what me and Big Show is doing Sunday is not like what, um, every other wrestler, you know, is doing.  It is no holds bar.  You know, may the best man win.  It's going to be, yeah, it's definitely going to be interesting on Sunday.  I mean, he, he don't like, he don't like me and I don't like him. 
[02:17:30]  Period.  I keep picturing like Hulk Hogan throwing Rocky out of the ring.  Yeah, right.  It didn't happen though, right?  It's like Rocky 3.  Vince is trying to get Rocky 3 going.  Well, anything, anything is possible.  Right.  That's why we want all the fans that's tuning in right now on the best station in the nation,  listen to the best fighter in the world.  You must tune in Sunday and watch, uh.  You forgot the best radio show in America.  This is the, uh, man.  You might as well drag us into this.  Of course, best station in the nation.  Uh, best show.  Okay. 
[02:18:00]  Best show.  Smartass.  Okay, no problem.  They still got, if it's a show, they still got to tune in.  There you go, you're right.  I will say this.  I'm not a wrestling fan.  I don't watch wrestling, but this fight.  You would watch this.  I'm aware of.  Yeah.  Um, I, I, I want to see it and it's really.  I'm nervous a little bit.  Yeah.  Hmm.  I'm, I'm honest with you guys.  I'm nervous a little bit.  What are you nervous about?  That he's going to throw you out of the ring or that he's going to do some kind of damage  that's going to hurt you, like, for the future?  It could happen.  That was a stupid question.  What else would he be nervous about?  Yeah, really. 
[02:18:30]  He's going to do his taxes and cheat and get caught.  You know what I'm an idiot.  But this music means that we're running out of, uh, of show.  Oh, man.  We're actually running late.  Yeah.  But, uh, yeah, we didn't think you were going to make it.  We're actually glad you came in.  92.3 K-Rock.  Yeah.  Uh, Floyd Mayweather, uh, obviously fighting the big show.  Uh, WrestleMania Sunday night.  I think it's eight o'clock.  Uh, seven o'clock, Jimmy, I believe, on pay-per-view.  7 p.m.  On pay-per-view and, uh, the Citrus Bowl in Orlando.  7 p.m.  Eastern.  Eastern time.  Wrestlemania.com for info. 
[02:19:00]  How much is it?  The pay-per-view.  A buck fifty.  $40?  It's a bargain at any price.  Well, I'm home Sunday.  I just want to know.  Yeah.  Now you got to check it out, right?  We're going to throw down.  I'm definitely painful.  Good luck, man.  Thank you.  I would love to see you knock that big, dumb monster out.  That would really make me happy.  I'm going to try.  Well, if worse comes to life, just bring a pipe in the ring.  How great would that be if you pull the pipe and just smack them?  Who are these guys, Jimmy?  All these tricks up my sleeve.  Is the entourage going to be at ringside?  Yeah, they're going to be.  That's the family.  Wow, man. 
[02:19:30]  We don't believe in talking about it.  We don't believe in calling them an entourage or a posse.  We believe in calling them a social gathering or a family.  Well, Big Show's in trouble.  Some socializing.  Big Show does the wrong thing.  He's in deep trouble looking at these guys over here in the corner.  They seem very light-hearted.  Yeah, light-hearted.  All right, we got to go over to XM.  Thank you so much.  Thank you so much.  God bless.  Good luck.  All right.  We're off to XM, and have a good day.  Oh, Nick DiPaolo.  Caroline's tonight.  Caroline, Data Club.  NickDip.com. 
[02:20:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good. 
[02:20:30]  Shock Jocks.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  What happened to you?  I put, uh, 380 to my chest.  And I pulled the trigger.  Hey, how did help, uh, show up for you?  The question is, why did help show up for you? 
[02:21:00]  This is where entertainment is going.  They are sick, freaks.  So you're kind of like, um, transvestite.  Or transsexual.  Transsexual, sorry.  On your underwear, do you have a sign that says,  pardon our appearance for remodeling?  This is the worst.  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[02:21:30]  And here we are at XM Satellite Radio.  Nick DiPaolo has made the walk.  Money Mayweather has not made, uh, the walk.  That was a very interesting interview, by the way.  Yeah, he was, uh, I mean, again, he looked like he was really tired.  Someone said they were out late night the night before.  Really?  I don't believe it.  Him and his, uh, family, as they said.  Yeah.  Not a posse.  Probably, uh, the most intimidating group of people I've ever seen in my life. 
[02:22:00]  I, I just gotta be completely honest.  There were four guys that were much bigger than Kenny.  And Kenny is huge.  Kenny is 6'5 and close to 300 pounds, I, I would guess.  Uh, one guy was 7 foot tall.  Yeah.  And, and Kenny said he was probably pushing 400 pounds.  Yeah.  A pure fucking muscle.  The other guy was at least 6'9.  Another guy was 6'6 and wide.  Yeah.  With arms, like.  And then, and then they had some small guys in the area of 6'3, 6'4. 
[02:22:30]  2'8, 2'8, 2'8, 5.  Holy shit.  They were, the biggest guys, they, they reminded me, I'll tell you the scariest entourage I've  ever seen or group, whatever you're gonna call it, was, uh, was, uh, when I was at a  press junket for MTV, Snoop was there.  Oh, yeah.  And, and the big guy, there was, people didn't see, the biggest guy was about 7 feet, and  every one of Snoop's guys was that big.  There was 6 of them that big.  I mean, it was a wall of fucking, it was a Japanese monster movie.  It was fucking, and, and the reason, I think, one of the reasons is, is because these guys 
[02:23:00]  have to be careful about carrying pistols, because they get searched, and if they get  pulled over, I mean, you're gonna go to jail if you have a fucking pistol, so they need  some kind of a visual deterrent.  And when you walk into these places where they wand you, you can't have a gun.  So you'd be bringing these fucking monsters.  And I think also they like the way it looks.  I'd rather fight a guy with a fucking gun than those guys.  Yeah.  I think you have a better chance of living.  Yeah, no kidding.  I, I, I was hoping they were gonna make the walkover, because I want to sit down the family.  It's obvious they're very intimidating and scary and can just tear our heads off our  bodies, but I wanted to, like, maybe get into what they find funny. 
[02:23:30]  I wanted to say, what do you find funny?  Maybe they would, you know, Disney movies.  Killing white people.  That's pretty much what I think.  I was gonna go, this is the family.  Which one's Fredo?  Yeah.  No, the six foot five one, that's 380.  That's Fredo.  I'm smart.  I've never seen Nick Carter more excited.  He comes running in and he's like, what do you got to say now, motherfuckers?  Yeah.  Nothing stupid.  What are you talking about?  We talk behind your back, just like Jeremiah Wright does ours.  And then the door opens and these monsters walk in. 
[02:24:00]  Monsters.  Yeah, they're big dudes.  They refuse to smile or acknowledge that, uh...  Oh, they don't like us.  Let's be honest.  That's what I like about them.  Floyd was nice, though.  He came in and he didn't get the edge of that.  He was very congenial.  Shook hands with everybody in the room and he's just, he's a gentleman, man.  He's a, you know, and he'll also fucking break your jaw.  He'll kill you.  And Jimmy did a great job with the interview and you were asking, like, questions about this,  uh, this fight he's having with Big Show during WrestleMania, like, it's going to be a real fight.  Now, I'm not sure if it is. 
[02:24:30]  Because usually this stuff is, like, pre-planned and they've got a thing going on.  But I hear that, uh, Money Mayweather actually broke Big Show's nose.  Yeah.  Maybe he was supposed to, like, you know, go in there and do a little something-something,  but I guess it got real.  Maybe because Mayweather didn't size him up right or whatever.  Where's, uh, Sam, our wrestling expert?  Because he really is a big dude.  And you're probably not that big.  I didn't even reach him.  And I don't want you to do the company line today because you're well-known, uh, with the WWE. 
[02:25:00]  Okay.  Did Mayweather really, uh, break, uh, Big Show's nose?  Or was that all a bit?  Well, no, it was not a bit because his nose was swollen and bleeding directly after he punched him.  It wasn't, like, camera tricks or anything.  Yeah?  Now, whether...  But Big Show's the type of guy he might have even said, just break my nose.  That's like getting, like...  No, I'm serious.  That's like getting a hangnail to you and I.  Like, I can take this.  You don't, like, break the Big Show's nose and then they offer you a gig.  You know what I mean?  Like, if he was not supposed to hit the Big Show hard, he wouldn't... 
[02:25:30]  This is the guy that believed Vince blew up in the limo.  Come on.  Why are we questioning him?  This is the actor that plays Sam Ryan.  Oh, oh, oh.  He's ripping off your bit.  Hey!  Bitcourt.  Two demerits.  He, uh, may have been supposed to hit him, but not that hard.  You know, whatever.  Right, that's what I'm thinking.  Like, something went awry.  Well, you might have just said, go ahead, punch me in the face.  Just don't break my jaw.  Yeah, but how is this going to look good on...  He broke his nose.  How is this fight going to look good, uh, as part of WrestleMania there, Sam?  I don't know. 
[02:26:00]  They haven't even...  Sam, comment?  They haven't even made clear how they're working it.  Like, I...  At the press conference yesterday, they wouldn't...  They won't say whether it's a boxing match or a wrestling match.  Big Show is going to be able to take a lot of body punchers from Mayweather.  Yeah.  So how does this work?  And if Big Show could just get his arms around him, it's over.  Yep.  Is the family going to be running in and that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's going to be like...  Absolutely.  That's what's probably going to happen.  It's going to be like an altercation.  The family runs in.  The Big Show's got people. 
[02:26:30]  They all start hitting each other.  Guys, it's Rocky.  Was it three with Hulk?  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  When Pauly jumps in the ring with...  Right.  Pauly got the chair.  This is what I picture.  I picture Big Show picking him up and trying to bear hug him.  Thunder lips.  Yeah.  This Thunder Lips and fucking Rocky Balboa.  That's what I see, no?  They did a thing on Raw like a couple weeks ago where the Big Show actually did pick  him up and Gorilla Press slam him.  Oh, I saw that.  I saw that.  Yeah.  Because Floyd did have his whole crew at ringside, but then basically every single wrestler in  the locker room came out.  They don't care about Floyd's crew. 
[02:27:00]  Big Show is seven feet and he's a professional wrestler.  He would throw those bodyguards around.  He's a fucking pro wrestler.  He doesn't care about how big they are.  How old is Big Show?  He's been around a while now.  Yeah, but he started young.  I mean, he's probably...  He's probably still in his thirties.  He's late.  Yeah, late thirties.  Those guys don't live long, you know.  Guys that big.  You know that?  No.  No.  Not at all.  They can't.  Yeah.  Something about their heart having to pump blood up to the fucking 12 stories to their  head.  Yeah.  That's some skull. 
[02:27:30]  I don't know.  I'm so fascinated by guys like that.  We were walking over.  I was thinking, like, how nice would it be to be like a Liddell or a Rampage where as  big as those guys are, there's not a person in the room that intimidates you.  You know what?  You'd be a fucking problem.  It's good that you're a puny.  No.  Because you'd be a problem.  If you were a big guy, your attitude, because you seem like you want it so bad just to beat  people up.  You'd be that guy that just beats people up for nothing.  No, but I'm saying, like, to know, like, that if a guy seven feet tall came after you, 
[02:28:00]  like, to know that you...  I mean, he couldn't now box Mayweather, but he could get him against the wall on the floor  and then it's all over.  Yeah.  But that's where the posse comes in.  See, they don't fight one-on-one.  Well, I'm saying...  They're seven-on-one.  That's...  They travel in packs for a reason.  The stomping.  And in the words of Keith Robinson, they don't play fight.  Oh, come on, man.  Keith goes, black people don't play fight.  Oh, here they go.  See, that...  That's Mayweather?  That's Mayweather right there.  Getting thrown...  See, that's right out of Rocky III.  Yeah, absolutely.  Throwing him out of the ring, but he's caught by... 
[02:28:30]  Convenient people that were, yeah.  That just happened to be in that place.  Why wouldn't Big Show, like, turn around and go somewhere else with this?  Look.  Yeah.  That's pretty impressive, though.  It just throws him over the top ring and...  And thank God.  You got to Mayweather for letting him do it, too.  I know!  Like you said, this guy's worth trillions.  He lands wrong, breaks his shoulder, or whatever.  Yeah, it's over.  Hey, there's the real family jumping in.  I didn't know they were part of the...  Oh, they're part of the whole thing.  Oh, yeah.  They get in there.  Nice.  Oh, okay.  So it's going to get...  The big black guy, that seven foot, is going to, like, go toe-to-toe with Big Show. 
[02:29:00]  It looks like he hurt his arm.  There's the guy.  There's the guy that was there today, the bald dude with the glasses.  Yeah, yeah.  And he hurt his elbow.  He's selling it.  He looks like Jim Brown, isn't he?  He's trying to sell it.  He is selling it pretty good.  He didn't really fall hard.  Let's be honest here, Sam.  No.  Can we see that throw again?  And where's he breaking his nose?  He landed on a table with people.  Where did he punch him in the nose?  That was a different one.  Yeah, that was at the pay-per-view called No Way Out.  That happened on Larry King.  No Way Out.  How important is the crowd that you throw him into? 
[02:29:30]  This is a fucking...  He would just hit the floor.  Look at this.  Look at how big this fucking dude is.  I know.  Look at the...  Oh, yeah.  The Big Show is just ridiculous.  Why is he throwing him...  They all catch him?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why didn't he throw him just, like...  If you're throwing him four feet over to one side, just walk two more steps,  he'd have landed flat on the cement, problem solved.  Those guys are like five dogs waiting for a milk bone that would just stand their arms  out like this.  Yeah, waiting to catch him.  Big Show's 36. 
[02:30:00]  Thanks to the fans.  And a lot of people saying, and I believe it, too, it's all a work, 100%.  Even the breaking of the nose.  Come on.  It's gotta be.  I heard somebody yell, cut, at the end of the scene.  Yeah.  Steve, what do you got?  Are you all right?  It's all real.  Trust me.  What is this?  A bit from Derek?  A bit from Derek.  About what?  All right, well.  Is this the punch in the nose?  Yeah, that's when the...  Oh, right.  Big Show came out.  Big Show comes out. 
[02:30:30]  He's getting the adulation from the fans.  He's not dressed to wrestle.  He's dressed in a suit.  Yeah.  Because he's going to be doing some big business deal, I'm sure.  I mean, they're not a...  Smiling.  Look at that.  He's heading to Barneys for a tie.  It's a comforter.  Yeah, look at the size of that.  It's like the H quilt with buttons.  Jesus.  Look at the shoulders on this freak.  He's walking up the stairs.  Yeah, he's not intimidated by the ring.  Oh, my God.  And Andre the Giant was about four to five inches taller than the Big Show.  Yeah.  And that Russian is a foot and five inches taller. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, what is he?  The Big Show goes over the top rope when he steps in the ring.  Eight-five?  No, no.  He's a regular guy.  It's just...  It's ridiculous.  And now we can't sit through the...  And now blah, blah, blah.  He's talking...  When does the punch come up?  A little later, he's...  A little later?  What the...  There he goes.  He grabs Rey Mysterio.  All right.  He's grabbing Rey Mysterio.  He's also very small.  He's very mysterious.  Jesus, I guess.  Looks like Gary Coleman.  Bitch is slapping him.  Oh, now he's taunting...  Who's that?  Is that supposed to be Mayweather? 
[02:31:30]  Mayweather in the crowd.  Yeah, Mayweather's there.  Oh, he's in the crowd.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Luckily, he's got that front row seat.  Yeah.  He's a big star.  Where is he going to sit?  Of course.  That's a good point.  This is director Oliver Stone.  Yelling action.  Now, uh...  Oh, Mayweather's shaking his head like,  No, man.  Oh, Mayweather.  Oh, boy.  Oh, Rey Mysterio is Mayweather's friend.  Looks like a convenience store in Brooklyn.  He...  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right.  He punched him once.  That's cute.  Did he?  Did he punch him?  They're kind of in the gut a little bit. 
[02:32:00]  And now, he pushes Mayweather.  Oh, he shoves Mayweather.  Mayweather comes back.  A little push.  Wouldn't the...  He shoves Mayweather, and the fucking guys are all holding Mayweather back.  Yeah, holding him back.  Not very good, though.  Why wouldn't they...  Oh, the big...  The show gets on his fucking knees.  Oh!  There it is.  All right.  He punched him in the nose.  He did.  He landed a couple of shots.  He did kind of punch him in the side of the face.  He fucking lit him up and pulled his ass out of there.  Now, they're running.  And he ran.  I don't blame him.  Ha, ha, ha.  You know something, though?  The big show, he's...  He's meant to take shit like that.  Yeah.  I'm a wrestler.  He's a big A. 
[02:32:30]  Some of these guys are insane.  I know it's a work, but a lot of these guys go,  Look, I'll take the broken nose for the bit.  God, look at Shane.  I agree.  Absolutely.  You know, so I...  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Shane is looking so much like Vince these days.  That's Shane.  Yeah.  That's Shane O'Mac.  Is that his kid?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Shane McMahon.  That's how old I am.  Oh, my God.  Remember when he was like, yeah.  Yeah.  Fresh-faced little kid.  Well, I remember when Vince was a fresh-faced...  You know?  I was like eight years old.  Saturday afternoon, Channel 9.  I performed at his bachelor party.  That's the Tanaka Brothers.  Who's?  Shane.  Oh, did you?  Bob Levy. 
[02:33:00]  I want to be in wrestling.  I'm telling you, fucking idiot.  I thought I'm going to be a wrestler.  You got the name for it, Bob.  That's it.  Tallest Man of the World is in China.  He's 8'11".  Thank you, Sergeant G from Iraq.  Is he really?  And then you got Michael Williams from Michigan.  He writes, Nick Dip Rules.  I'm glad he's been on more.  Thank you.  He does a good job of representing the angry white man.  Thank you.  Or something like that.  I kept my mouth shut when the big...  Angry whitey's point of view.  Matt Mayweather smelled good.  I know.  God damn, he smelled good.  I wanted to ask him what kind of colonel it was.  You smell him. 
[02:33:30]  I was just sitting next to him.  He smelled like a rich guy.  I think it was Old Spice.  No, Nick.  It had to be something more than that.  This is what...  You got something, Jimmy?  No, yeah.  I forgot.  The guy said something.  No.  What did the guy say before?  Sam kissed a homeless gay guy.  After he spent the morning blowing guys at a glory hole.  Not Sam.  He didn't do that, but the homeless guy did.  Homeless guy, blowing guys at a glory hole all morning. 
[02:34:00]  He had to brag about it that it was all morning, not just a quickie.  And then Sam happened to run upon this guy in the street and decided he needed to kiss  him.  I didn't decide.  Good story.  Wait a minute.  Thanks, Sam.  Thanks for coming by.  First of all.  All right.  My mic's not out anymore.  What?  You didn't decide you needed to kiss him.  Yeah.  That's all that the people need to know and Nick needs to know.  Who's going to be at Caroline's tonight?  Tonight.  Eight o'clock.  Thanks, Sam, for the wrestling knowledge.  And good luck with the AIDS.  Right.  Wait till you wake up with purple patches, all of you, ahead in about a week.  It won't be so funny. 
[02:34:30]  I want to kiss more guys.  Stop with that.  What?  I want to kiss more guys.  Will you stop?  It's not me.  I want to kiss more guys.  That's it.  I really got to turn around.  Wow.  You're Mike for good now.  Enough.  It's a recording.  Yeah.  Sure it is.  I want to kiss more guys.  Not me.  Oh, Sam.  Oh, Sam.  We're standing right here.  All right.  Thank you, Sam.  This was put together by Derek.  Hillary Clinton is running for president.  Hillary!  Hillary! 
[02:35:00]  Hillary Clinton has a spotty memory.  I certainly do remember that trip to Bosnia.  These events never happened.  And I remember landing under sniper fire.  Alzheimer's is a devastating illness that affects millions of people worldwide.  Okay, listen up.  Did anybody see a sniper?  Did anybody see anything?  Anybody see a sniper?  Including Hillary Clinton.  There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport. 
[02:35:30]  Murph will receive an enemy sniper fire.  Eight ball is down.  But instead, we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicle.  Give generously to the Hillary Clinton Alzheimer's Foundation.  It was a moment of great pride for me.  This promotional message is complete bullshit.  Very, very good.  That's good.  Yes.  And then Hillary said, yeah, I'm going to put it right up that big bitch's ass. 
[02:36:00]  That's right.  Hillary, would you like to surf?  I misspoke.  What the fuck?  You misspoke.  They could just get away with anything they want by saying...  That's a big misspoke.  You ever have a gun pointed at you, a fucking live gun?  You don't ever forget it, right?  And then one of her stupid reps said, oh, what happened was there was gunfire up in the  hillsides.  Yeah, in Nebraska.  Yeah, exactly.  Twats on.  And she makes it sound like, you know, they had to run from the plane to the convoy and 
[02:36:30]  get to the base because she was under fire.  That's misspeaking?  No, that's lying.  She's lying.  That's a fucking outright lie.  Yeah.  There's no way you can talk your way out of that one.  No.  I mean...  No.  Misspoken was like, I had red shoes on it.  They know they happen to be blue.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Misspoke.  She's a liar.  And what was her comment on this now?  Has she said anything about this or no?  No, she wants it to go away.  Yeah, she did say something on it. 
[02:37:00]  She said, I would never go to a church with Jeremiah.  She tried to throw it back in Barack's lap.  Right.  She did say that.  She goes, yeah, if I was in a church and my pastor said something like that, she goes,  I think it's clear what I would do.  Yeah, duck under the sniper fire, you cunt.  What would you do?  Fucking liar.  I don't even care about Wright.  This is what a shitty campaign she's running.  He was embarrassed by this fucking Jeremiah Wright thing.  This was bad.  Oh, yeah.  And then this dumb bitch fucking...  Right.  Well, then again, she lied all those...  Why?  Great timing, too. 
[02:37:30]  Great timing.  You bailed him out.  She was actually gaining momentum because of the whole Jeremiah Wright thing.  Had him a little wobbly.  And then she sticks her fat ankle in her fat mouth.  Her spiritual advisor is David Duke.  What a fucking idiot she is.  I wonder why he stuck a cigar in that girl's cunt.  Hillary said she'd do it and she lied.  Oh, she's fucking sucks.  What a fucking beating she's taking in the poll.  I'm telling you, Obama is going to be the next president.  Oh, dude.  Is he?  No.  McCain's age.  It's going to be McCain.  That's my only issue with him. 
[02:38:00]  I do want the war to be over.  I don't give a fuck about freedom for them.  I don't care if they all just eat dirt and enslave each other.  I want the economy better.  I really don't care anymore.  I'm fucking tired of it.  I know.  But what happened?  I mean, you work till May to pay your fucking taxes.  You work till May, everybody.  Yeah.  And this motherfucker, he's going to raise them.  Yeah, there's no qualms about it.  What the fuck?  And then you want to give illegals, drivers?  How is that going to, in the debates?  And you think that Clinton's campaign is digging up shit in Obama. 
[02:38:30]  Wait till the Republicans get a hold of him.  Yeah.  So they're probably sitting on shit right now.  Oh, absolutely they are.  Like that guy that blew him in a limo.  We actually have a video of him being blown.  That guy sounded like Dick Morris.  You know, we got to play Larry Sinclair one more time because it is XM.  You got to hear the fine language.  Uncensored.  Uncensored stuff.  I don't care who gets elected.  It wouldn't even bother me.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  In the end, it doesn't matter.  I think you're right.  I don't have faith that they're going to lower the taxes.  To be honest with you, because the war is so expensive, I don't have faith that 
[02:39:00]  we're going to pay less because the war is just so fucking expensive, man.  It's a big expense.  It really is.  It's one of those huge expenses that aren't real money, though.  It's too much money for it to be real money.  Yeah.  We already owe everybody everything.  It's just shoved off onto some national debt that somehow in years to come when someone  else gets in there, they figure it all out.  Like Clinton cleaned it up for a while.  There was no debt.  It was great.  He had a balanced budget and everything.  And that's exactly how the neocons look at it. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  Seriously.  They go, we're not going to pay for it.  Spend your fucking ass off.  It really is hilarious.  That's how they look at it, you know?  They're like, we're not going to fucking...  Chaney almost said it like a couple years ago.  Yeah.  Came close.  What's that?  A bullet costs $450?  Who gives a fuck?  We're not going to pay this back.  That's the beauty of the whole thing.  It really is.  Yeah.  Come on.  Larry Sinclair on Censor.  We've been playing this guy all morning long.  His video is way better than just the audio.  He's a kook.  He sounds like a real goo gobbler. 
[02:40:00]  What's he look like?  He's one of those compulsive liars.  He's a compulsive liar that believes what he's saying.  Simple as that.  You think he believes it?  I absolutely do.  He completely believes it.  I absolutely do.  I don't think this guy's trying to be a YouTube sensation out of nowhere.  I think he's like, wait, I know how I can get my message out.  I've got to make a YouTube video.  I think he's a kook.  A young black cock years ago.  I think he thinks it's Barack.  He's probably a guy that looks like Obama.  You know, skinny, fucking mocha latte colored guy who's really well-edown. 
[02:40:30]  Slender belly.  Hi.  My name is Larry Sinclair.  I'm making this video and posting it on YouTube because of an incident involving myself and Senator Barack Obama.  Between November 3rd and November 8th of 1999 in the Chicago, Illinois area.  The mainstream media and Obama himself has done greatly to prevent this story from becoming public.  During those time periods in 1999, I met Obama at an upscale lounge in Chicago, Illinois. 
[02:41:00]  After having a few drinks, Obama and I left in my limo, began to drink.  Look, Mr. Obama acquired powder cocaine for my use, crack cocaine for his use.  I performed oral sex on Senator Obama, who at the time was a state representative for the state of Illinois.  Mr. Obama knows these allegations to be true.  I'm challenging Mr. Obama to come forth, be honest, stop claiming that his drug use is limited to his teenage years. 
[02:41:30]  1999, you weren't a teenager.  1999, you were state representative for the people of the state of Illinois.  1999, I performed oral sex on you in the back of my limo, as well as in my hotel room in Gurney, Illinois, two days later.  If you challenge the authenticity of this allegation, I challenge you to take a polygraph test, as I will submit to as well. 
[02:42:00]  Now, these allegations are true and need to be told to the public, that the public decide whether Mr. Obama is being forthright and honest.  Thank you.  Just think how, if this guy's father's a Republican, how bittersweet that is.  Yeah.  If it's true.  All right, my son sucked off this black guy in the back of a limo, but it'll fucking get the Republicans in there.  Good boy.  Yeah.  Tomorrow, he's going to come out with one said he fucked McCain in the ass on a boat trip. 
[02:42:30]  He also shared anal nitrate with John McCain.  That would be hysterical.  He keeps coming out every day with a different one.  And snowballed him in the back of my limo.  Hillary Clinton gave me a ruby shower.  I pink socked her in the back of my limo, and she slammed it in the door, and it dragged like a fucking coat tie.  Hillary Clinton strapped on a dildo and fucked my ass and gave me a pink sock.  I licked the taint.  In Gurney, Illinois. 
[02:43:00]  In Gurney.  She slammed the limo door on her own fucking pink sock asshole.  Her pink sock, and dragged it like a jacket sleeve hanging out someone's fucking car door.  And she jumped and went, ow, it pinches.  Donald Rumsfeld tossed my salad in the back of a taxi.  I love this guy.  Fucking Larry rules.  It would be great if he let this one roll for a while and then came out with allegations about Hillary.  Yeah, exactly.  Or McCain.  I was in the POW camp sucking McCain's cock as he was being beaten by VC. 
[02:43:30]  His arms were broken when I held them behind his back to lick his asshole in a mock interrogation scene.  That's right.  Oh, shit.  I straddled Nancy Reagan's chest and titty fucker until they both fell off.  Ronald Reagan put his colon on my mouth and I ate it out.  I scalp fucked John F. Kennedy in Dallas in the early 60s. 
[02:44:00]  He's just a fag-zelig.  I stuck my dick in Kennedy's exit wound and then came right on his frontal lobe.  I masturbated on Lady Bird Johnson's shoes in the back of my limousine.  And I'm only 22 years old.  Larry St.  There's a goose.  Oh, that's a good question from Jason from Columbus.  Think this guy ever got pulled over and tried to bribe a cop asking, we could take care of this right here in Gurney. 
[02:44:30]  Here in Gurney.  I figured we'd take care of it.  You know, here in Gurney.  Here in Gurney.  He's unzipping his fly.  Right here in Gurney.  Oh, I don't know.  Step out of the vehicle, sir.  What's the phrase he said?  A bunch of people are commenting about Dr. Steve.  Where is Dr. Steve?  Yeah.  Has done greatly.  Nice English, dumbass.  Coming in from Dr. Steve. 
[02:45:00]  Well, the guy maybe is not talking about the best English, but he's talking about Obama copping drugs for both of them sucking his cock.  Yeah.  Dr. Steve is harping on his fucking, his dangling participles.  I suck his cock.  I love the, I love the stereotypical, uh, copping of the drugs.  The cocaine for the white man and the crack for the black man.  Regular coke and then extra crispy for, uh, Obama.  Right, right.  Fucking.  Wouldn't it be funny if Hillary, like, loses another ten points next week in the poll? 
[02:45:30]  So she starts trying to, you know, you know, fucking edge this story on.  Legitimize this one?  Yeah, I don't know about Jeremiah Wright, but, uh.  There's something about how he says it.  He believes what he's saying.  And Bill's like, you heard what happened in Gertie.  Yeah.  Hey, uh, we got the kiss of death, uh, scene that you were talking about.  Oh, fucking Richard Widmark.  Want to set this up there?  Did we lose, uh, yeah, we lost him, right?  Died in the, he's, this movie's in the 40s.  He's dead.  Yeah.  Richard Widmark.  He died in Roxbury, Connecticut, 93 years old.  Oh, wait, we're not done with that bit, though. 
[02:46:00]  One more.  Joe Schneider from Pittsburgh.  Bob Dole put his deformed hand on my penis in my limo.  Held it like a pencil.  Right.  I terrorized Ross Perot's daughter at her own wedding while I jerked off.  The, uh, thanks, Kenny.  I'm coming out to tell you that that wasn't a pretzel that George W. Bush was choking on.  Gotta give credit here.  That's funny.  Very good.  Oh, Thomas Overbeck's on fire with this bitch.  I fingered the ass of Squeaky Fromm as she attempted to shoot Gerald Ford, and then he fell down the stairs. 
[02:46:30]  And his cock went in my mouth.  I ate Alberta Bush's dried-up snatch in the back of a dump truck.  Those frosty snow-white pubes.  I fellated eight pilots that were killed when Jimmy Carter tried to send them to rescue the hostages in 1980.  I once fucked F.B.  I tipped him out of, I tipped Franklin Delano Roosevelt out of his wheelchair.  And then fucked him in the shithole. 
[02:47:00]  While Eleanor ate my girlfriend's pussy.  Someone is, uh, saying that he, uh, well, Chris P. from Philly, yeah.  He sounds a little like Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Steven S. from Bayshore writes, uh, what happens in Gurney obviously doesn't stay in Gurney.  No.  That's a shitty name for a ton.  Fucking Gurney.  Maybe after something, you take fucking injured people out of him.  Yeah. 
[02:47:30]  If you're fucking sucking dick in Gurney.  Holy shit, is your life fucked?  There's only one way of bragging about it on YouTube.  I got my, I got my asshole fingered in bedpan.  I'm actually playing the funny bone in Gurney next week.  In Gurney.  Right here in Gurney.  Great town.  All right, we got, uh, this fine scene from Kiss of Death that Jimmy was referring to earlier,  and we lost, uh, this fine, uh, actor.  He was 93 years old.  Richard, uh, Widmark.  Yes.  You know what I do to squeeze? 
[02:48:00]  I let him have it in the belly, so they can roll around for a long time, thinking it over.  You're worse than him.  Tell him he's coming back.  You lying old hag.  Hey, that's some tough talk.  Sounds like when a Norton's date. 
[02:48:30]  I can't go on this side.  I'm outside.  I can't move.  I think.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Oh, my God.  That's pretty edgy for, like, 1930.  That's classic.  Oh, that ain't edgy for 1930. 
[02:49:00]  That's a comedy.  I like to see that reenacted with Stephen Hawking.  No.  No.  No.  Please.  No.  Oh, God.  That sinister laugh as he considers, like, he sees what he's about to do, and he's like,  it tickles him.  It's like this.  I crack me up.  I'm going to push it down the fucking stairs.  That was in the 40s.  That shit goes on in nursing homes every day, you know.  I want to hear Victor mature talking to the woman.  Huh?  Oh, Nick. 
[02:49:30]  Nick.  He loves fucking Nick.  Can we get that one, too?  Oh, yeah.  Why don't we take a quick break?  We got some fine shambos in front of us right now.  We got to get to Nick DiPaolo in studio playing Caroline's tonight here in New York City.  Oh, shit.  That could be line of the day.  No, it's funny.  I ain't going to repeat it.  Let's go to a break.  What was it?  I didn't hear it because I was too busy helping you out now.  Thank you.  Oh, dude.  No.  Thanks, Will.  Hysterically funny.  I know.  I just missed it.  That's all I'm saying.  Yeah.  That's so wrong. 
[02:50:00]  All right.  Ugh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Hey.  Oh.  Hey.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, fuck.  What the hell's going on here? 
[02:50:30]  Awful.  Awful.  They're just awful.  Awful people.  Rock and roll.  Rock and roll.  Opie and Anthony.  Nick DiPaolo in studio.  Uh.  Someone writes,  Can someone give that ferret-faced, caustic conservative his own Saturday night virus show? 
[02:51:00]  He kills on his shitty basement web show.  I think that's a compliment.  I think that was a compliment right there.  I'm doing, I don't, ferret face.  Well, I don't know about that.  What the hell was that?  I don't, I don't look at you that closely there.  I'll take it anyways.  I listen to you very closely, though.  Oh, but I'm doing blog TV from my basement.  Are you really?  Yeah.  Why not?  I'm getting paid to do it.  You're going to be the next Larry Sinclair.  What are you going to be admitting on your blog TV? 
[02:51:30]  This is Nick DiPaolo.  Some of my biggest fans are from Gurney.  Gurney.  Bunch of hairlip fags.  Fuck Gurney.  Fuck Gurney.  Fuck Gurney in its ass.  Yeah, no kidding.  And getting back to the Richard Widmark thing, a quote from the great Richard Widmark, who  we lost overnight.  Yeah.  That damn laugh of mine.  For two years after that picture, you couldn't get me to smile.  I played the part the way I did because the script struck me as funny, and the part I  played made me laugh. 
[02:52:00]  The guy was such a ridiculous beast.  What a great quote.  That's what he said?  He was also in All the Right Moves, too.  You're kidding.  He played the cranky old guy, or the guy who was trying to stop them.  Turn around.  He was like...  All the Right Moves with Tom Cruise, you mean?  Oh, no.  I'm thinking of...  Yeah, you got to...  What's the movie with that song?  Everybody said to turn around.  That's fucking Phil Collins song. 
[02:52:30]  Phil Collins?  What are you talking about?  I'm trying so hard.  You know what I mean, don't you?  Bonnie Tyler, you know.  Da-da-da-da.  Turn around and see me cry.  Totally Clips of the Heart?  Oh, no.  I know that.  That's turn around.  Turn around, bright eyes.  I know, but bright eyes.  Listen to me.  Every motherfucking time I looked at Jeff Bridges.  That's right.  I think this has Jeff Bridges in it.  Yeah.  Oh, Captain Jack?  No, not that one.  They're just blurting shit out.  Not even a movie.  No. 
[02:53:00]  Captain, it just sounds like a movie that's fucking...  Yeah, that's it.  No.  It's All the Right Moves.  Oh, oh.  Against all odds.  Against all odds.  Against all odds.  Against all odds.  That's what I meant.  All right.  Whatever.  He was in that?  Yeah.  What did he play?  Fucking cobweb?  The father or whatever.  You were singing...  Fuck.  He's 112.  Wow.  Turn around.  Yeah, see?  That's a fucking laughing book.  Oh, there it is.  Go ahead.  Fuck it.  I'll sing right along with it.  I will too.  Ready?  And go.  Just finger your asshole in Gurney, Illinois. 
[02:53:30]  With a condom full of dirty load.  On your chin, Senator.  Gurney.  Gurney.  I want to play this dumb thing again.  That was my brother's nickname, and I'm not kidding.  We used to call him Gurney.  Gurney?  Yeah, when we were kids.  The phone's just lit today.  Let's say hi to Sean in North Carolina.  North Carolina, just a hot bit of activity as far as this radio show goes.  We've got to go down there, I'm thinking.  Sean, what's up?  Yeah, welcome to Gurney. 
[02:54:00]  We like to say it's the mastic of the Midwest.  Mastic.  Oh, no.  We're trying to find out about Gurney.  We have any...  Any Gurney facts?  Do we have any...  Any Gurney facts yet?  Can you get a house there for $11?  Oh, you were in for that.  I'm sorry.  Oh, I loved that day.  That was the funniest beating I've ever seen at Town Tank.  Well, Gurney might be worse than Mastic.  You got anything there, then?  Well, Travis is collating some facts.  Oh, here comes Travis.  Sit down, Travis.  I want you to enjoy yourself.  Gurney is the Shirley of the midway.  I think Mastic might be a stretch. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah, Mastic's a huge stretch.  Well, that doesn't look like a very long list.  Well, no, because it's not going to take long to prove my point, considering that the average  income is $75,000, and it's home to many Chicago Bears players.  Oh, shit.  I was hoping Gurney sucked 82% white.  That wrecks the whole bit.  Yeah.  It's 82% white.  Well, let's pretend.  Gurney.  What language is Gurney paradise for?  Gurney sounds like a hell of a place. 
[02:55:00]  It really is.  Brian Urlacher lives there.  What the hell's going on, man?  You're a bit killer.  I'm sorry.  I killed a bit.  I still like this Larry Sinclair.  You got to figure, because, well, the whole thing could be a lie.  This guy's sucking cock and snorting coke and the back of a limo in between prom dates.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  I can go make up some facts if you want.  No, it's over.  Gurney's a cool place, but... 
[02:55:30]  Great place to get your cock sucked or meet a Bears player.  Huh?  I'll keep this bit going.  Gurney's a paradise.  Yeah.  You need a limo and a nice warm mouth from a man with a hat and some stubble.  Maybe Walter Payton get AIDS for Mr. Sinclair.  You ever think of that?  That's right.  That's right.  Could happen.  Absolutely.  Or maybe Lyle Alzado had his brains sucked out in a limo in Gurney.  In Gurney.  Right here in Gurney.  Right here in Gurney.  He was seen leaving with a bandana.  You're darn tootin' it was Gurney. 
[02:56:00]  How many people do you think out there are going to just work the word Gurney into their  conversation today?  Gurney.  4,237.  Oh my god.  Will you shut up?  Fucking shut the fuck up.  Larry Literal.  Oh no.  Has made his appearance today.  Just shut the fuck up.  Just work in Gurney.  Even if the person has no clue what you're talking about.  Pam Babcock.  Everybody remember who she is?  Yeah.  Pam Babcock. 
[02:56:30]  Aside from having a very funny name, she is the woman who spent nearly two years in  a bathroom sitting on the toilet.  So long, in fact, that her ass, much like a tree that grows around a signpost on the side  of the road, grew around the toilet seat, and she had to be removed by paramedics with  the toilet seat, and well, there's an update on her.  Uh oh.  She's still alive. 
[02:57:00]  Uh huh.  Still alive.  Her ass welded to a toilet seat, and she's still alive.  You better make that deal.  Sonny was hot for that septic tank, wasn't he?  Well, that's bad luck for you, and bad luck for me.  You don't peel her ass off that deal.  By the way, I was in that line waiting for that bathroom.  That was in an Applebee's, right?  This fucking cunt.  Uh, well, let's see.  Her, I guess, live-in boyfriend, Corey McFerrin, 37, has been charged with a misdemeanor count 
[02:57:30]  of mistreatment of a dependent adult.  Uh huh.  Is that a...  Wait a minute.  You can get in trouble for that?  Is she paralyzed?  Is there something wrong?  I mean, other than her ass screwed up the seat.  Uh, the woman's aunt said she calls daily to the hospital to ask how Babcock's doing  and, uh, asked to talk to her.  Babcock has agreed to talk to her only once for about ten minutes.  And she had to go take a shit.  Haven't heard from her since.  It's been seven months. 
[02:58:00]  During one call, Babcock spoke little and mostly listened to her aunt.  Uh, recounted happy family memories.  Like, uh, swimming, camping, and boating.  But every memory probably was like, yeah, do you remember that time we went to the Super  8?  They had such a nice bathroom.  Yes.  What a great toilet.  What a great toilet.  That's what she talks about.  It had the old-fashioned toilet.  The kind you can sit under for two years.  Like, you can tape a Farsight calendar behind it.  Behind it.  With the old pull chain.  Happy family memory. 
[02:58:30]  Remember, she only took 11 days to shit.  Remember that?  We had a party for her?  What is she eating?  Spackle and fucking chicken quesadillas mixed?  Twelve turkey wraps and a pound of Silly Buddy.  Fucking veins are popping out of her head like a fucking...  Somebody fill in the blank.  I'm very tired right now.  God damn.  You got it, bro. 
[02:59:00]  You can throw oatmeal in there if you want.  I know where you're going.  Babcock.  Egg whites will do it too, my friend.  That's right.  Routine.  You're right.  The local diner, the guy who would always send her food over, said, I knew there was  something wrong because she would always have grits and a brick on it.  She just likes brick.  Sounds too much like grits.  Oh, my God.  She doesn't believe in fruit.  Her wounds are still very serious.  Her wounds?  Her wounds are still serious.  She's not out of the woods by any means. 
[02:59:30]  She's a very sick girl.  Was she on a toilet for a month, really?  No, for years.  Two years.  Two years.  She sat on the toilet.  Nobody checked on her?  This guy must love her to death, huh?  Let's see.  McFerrin told authorities Babcock feared leaving the bathroom and may not have left it for two  years, although he said he was unsure how long she was in there.  He said that he took her food and water daily.  He said that he repeatedly asked her to come out, but she usually replied saying, maybe tomorrow. 
[03:00:00]  Imagine what the living room looks like.  Hello.  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  I'll come out of the shitter tomorrow.  How awful is that?  He wants to eat her pussy.  He's got to put his chin on the fucking, like, hanging halfway on the toilet seat.  He hasn't had fucking anal sex in two years, this poor bastard.  Unless he could, like, fucking hit a big dick and he could squat on her and aim it down  and fishhook it up into her, took his seat.  Into her toe.  Fishhook it into her toe. 
[03:00:30]  Right up into her rear.  Was it just a very comfortable toilet seat?  What the fuck's going on?  Is she disabled?  I don't get this at all.  They're not giving enough details.  People want the fucking, they want to know the story.  Yeah, it makes me wonder.  How did her ass grow to the seat like that?  She'd have to sit there.  I can't get past what Nick's whole rant about it.  It's a fucking bloodbill popping in her forehead.  She's sitting in there from February to November.  Just straining her fucking hemorrhoids down like bubble wrap popping. 
[03:01:00]  They tell you, yeah, they tell you not to sit on the toilet too long after you take a dump  because that's what causes hemorrhoids, you know?  Yeah, your fucking shit will hang out.  Yeah, she's got, like, Napa Valley grapes hanging out of her ass.  You bang her.  It's like melted mozzarella coming down into the fucking toilet bowl.  I'm hanging in there.  What was the mixture again?  Quesadillas and what?  Yeah, fucking spackle and chicken quesadillas.  Fucking bruds.  That would give you a hurtin' lid. 
[03:01:30]  Oh my God, can you imagine the fucking, it's just hilarious to me.  That really is some type of mental illness that the boyfriend was such an enabler.  That's terrific.  He must have loved her.  She was in there for two years.  He knocked twice.  Yeah.  Where did he shit?  He shit in the kitchen sink with his cousin, Teddy.  I don't know.  Cousin Teddy.  I would have taken, the one way to get her off that seat, he should have just karate  kicked her off and watched her flesh rip and then laughed at her and she laid there  by the kitty litter. 
[03:02:00]  Get up, you lazy fucking psycho.  Like a pesky label that won't peel off of something.  It leaves a little on the seat.  Yeah, like an apple.  Yeah.  Comes off her ass.  Rip her off like a mattress tag.  You're embarrassing me in front of my friends.  Should have tied a chain around her neck and tied her back to a dump truck and pulled  her off, toilet and all, dragged her across the street, still stuck to her fucking ass.  Let the neighbors get a good look.  This is true.  And it's, you know, what's ironic?  Gurney happening.  Gurney.  It was in Gurney.  Right here in Gurney.  What a lying, cocksucking town. 
[03:02:30]  In Gurney.  She couldn't shit right here in Gurney.  How great would a fire have been in that place if she's just in the bathroom begging  for help?  Like where?  Shit or get off the, well, you know.  Shit or grow to the pot.  Oh my God.  He could have at least gone in there once a week with a spatula.  Yeah, I know.  And he just like flipped her a little bit.  Her name is Pam.  You think she wouldn't have gotten stuck?  Yeah, they need a no stick Teflon toilet seat.  Jesus Christ.  Fucking Jimmie.  Mr. Obama knows these allegations to be true. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  I'm challenging Mr. Obama to come forth, be honest, stop claiming that his drug use is  limited to his teenage years.  1999, you weren't a teenager.  1999, you were state representative for the people of the state of Illinois.  1999, I performed oral sex on you in the back of my limo.  Wow.  As well as in my hotel room in Gurney, Illinois, two days later.  Gurney.  In Gurney.  Right here in Gurney.  That makes it funny. 
[03:03:30]  That makes the story even funnier.  I know.  I love Gurney.  Because that might be a town where you would get a, you know, if you're famous, you want  to get a secret blowjob from a limo driver.  Who's going to find you in Gurney?  Gurney.  I bet Obama's saying this is a lie.  The whole thing happened in 96.  How great would it be if he took this whole thing seriously and actually agreed to the  lie detector test and they appeared to get this somewhere?  I want to see like Newt Gingrich on Fox tonight talking about this.  Yeah.  Kind of clean it up though.  God's diversity coming out of Gurney.  Yeah.  The no spin zone.  Yeah. 
[03:04:00]  We're here in Gurney.  It starts here.  Steven S. from Bayshore is writing that good old Miss Babcock needed a visit from Richard  Wynmark.  Yes!  Push her down the stairs with a cord pair on that dopey toilet of hers.  Oh, toilet.  Just laughing.  All of a sudden you just start unscrewing the toilet.  She's like, what are you doing?  You know what I do, bitch?  You shit is.  You shit is.  I've had it.  Just tumbling down the stairs of piss and shit flying out of the... 
[03:04:30]  You shit-nulled egg.  Why don't you hog the bathroom a little more?  I give it to him right in the colon.  I've been a hold of the piss since 1937.  Oh, God.  He's just giggling at the anticipation of her fucking just careening down the stairs.  Tearing off the seat at the impotent of the stairs.  Well, that's a wonderful update, Anthony.  Thanks for bringing that to us.  Oh, no problem.  I enjoy little updates like that.  We don't do enough of them, I know.  I hope she's all right. 
[03:05:00]  We've pretty much done all the news for today.  It's kind of a slow news day, so we're going to go into slow news day trilogy.  We like to do this from time to time.  We find stories that are worth playing on slow news days.  This is what the news does, so let's take a listen.  Whoever said three's a crowd probably never saw this.  Three people, one board.  We're trying to break out a new record, possibly today, with a triple snowboard. 
[03:05:30]  We have three people, one board.  They already hold a place in the Guinness Book of World Records with their two-man tandem board,  and now they're adding more.  Once they get up the mountain, they bolt the boards together 12 feet in all.  But having three people in the driver's seat took some getting used to.  It was good. It was great. It was a lot of fun.  How many times did you guys fall?  I think maybe three times.  Is that it?  That's it.  Once they perfect their new skill, Sweet says they'll want to teach those who otherwise may not be able to snowboard on their own. 
[03:06:00]  Put it into the adaptation center for handicap, autism, stuff like that.  People that aren't able to ride stuff like that, put them in the middle and cruise around and just enjoy it.  Yeah, let's fucking have a rain man crashing into me on the fucking black diamond.  Stupid fucks.  Yeah, put autistic kids on the fucking mountain so they can make me look worse as a skier and a fucking snowboarder, you ass. 
[03:06:30]  We strapped 11 people to a toboggan.  Who gives a fuck?  Exactly. That's why we're doing this bit.  I know. It's beautiful.  This shit passes at like 5 o'clock in L.A.  It's the top news story.  We love this bit.  It's great.  We get the slow news day stories and we play them for everybody.  Listen to this one.  This is horseradish.  You're most likely to have come across it as the powerful paste wasabi that's eaten with sushi.  Sushi.  Sushi.  It's eaten with sushi. 
[03:07:00]  Sushi.  What is sushi?  Fucking dumb limey.  Oh my God.  Sushi.  Yeah.  The powerful wasabi that's eaten with sushi.  Oh my God.  I just pictured his fucking green English teeth.  Wasabi all over him.  My teeth are the same color as wasabi.  You know, my breath smells like sushi.  Sushi.  Yeah. 
[03:07:30]  Fucking limeys.  Fucking A, man.  That's eaten with sushi.  This isn't...  Sushi.  With sushi.  Sounds like a hooker from Detroit.  Sushi.  Oh yeah.  It's one of those things.  Over and over again now.  That's eaten with sushi.  Sushi.  You know how to say sushi, you dummy.  He knows.  Yes, of course.  That's eaten with sushi.  And this is a new design of fire alarm.  Inside these cans, the smell of the horseradish has been extracted and carefully stored. 
[03:08:00]  In Japan, scientists have been putting the new alarm to the test.  Having allowed the subject to slip into a deep sleep, a button is pressed, the alarm triggered,  and horseradish pumped into the bedroom.  Wake up, hungry.  This man, like almost all of those taking part in a test, woke up inside two minutes.  What? 
[03:08:30]  Nick's just fucking annoyed.  What?  This is even too stupid for this bitch.  This is fucking Jesus.  What?  Why don't you just, Billy Martin used to have a bit about how poor they were as kids,  and they fucking have a fire alarm, so their dad used to take Jiffy Pop to their bedroom door.  So if the fire.  I'm not Billy Martin.  That was a good bit.  That's funny.  So this is supposed to wake you up, the smell of the wasabi?  Yeah.  In two minutes.  That's good.  You fucking barbecue in two minutes. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah, I would think a loud noise would be more effective than an odor, you dummy.  Why don't you have a fat chick come in who just ran 12 miles in August?  I'd rather have an ass an inch from my nose.  How about this?  There you go.  No, it has to smell like sushi.  Sushi.  What is it?  Oh my God.  The smell of sushi or...  What a dumbass.  Two minutes is a long time for a fire to ravage your bedroom.  Jesus Christ.  Wake up.  Wake up. 
[03:09:30]  This is my new favorite S word to say.  Sushi.  It used to be...  Sausage.  Yeah, this is fun.  Sausage.  Everyone's, yeah, just going to call it sushi now.  Sushi.  You want to go out for sushi?  My wife's breath is going to wake me up if there's a fire.  Once the lights are back on, he explains that the smell reminded him of times when he'd  swallowed too much horseradish by accident while eating sushi.  It wasn't even a mistake the first time, okay? 
[03:10:00]  Guys get the most unnatural speech patterns I've ever heard.  Speech pattern.  They stupid English.  They all talk like this.  It goes up at the end.  The newscasters are always doing this thing.  How the fuck is that?  While eating sushi, the scientist conducting the tests says he's excited by the invention's  potential to save the life of those with hearing disabilities. 
[03:10:30]  With tests continuing, the makers of the horseradish alarm are hoping to have it on the market within  the next two years.  Who the fuck's going to buy a horseradish alarm?  I know.  Why don't you just make it smell like smoke?  What the fuck?  Fucking idiots.  We're working on Tabasco eyedroppers.  For the visually impaired.  Visually impaired.  Those useless orbs do nothing anyway. 
[03:11:00]  Fucking deaf people.  Fuck them.  Those stupid candy dishes on their head.  Is that what it's for, deaf people?  Yeah, those fucking awful, those worthless orbs.  Fucking burn.  I just used your word, orbs.  Don't forget to replace your batteries in your wasabi.  Horseradish.  Well, continuing with the slow news day bit.  This one's just terrific.  They are big and they are yellow, but apparently they are not very green.  The free phone books that you get against. 
[03:11:30]  They're a type of sushi.  They are big and they are yellow, but apparently they are not very green.  The free phone books that you get on your doorstep could come with an environmental cost.  And in this age of the internet, some are wondering, are they worth printing at all?  Asking questions, getting answers.  Dennis Shanahan joining us live with this phone book discussion.  Dennis.  Well, stand with, pal.  Because we need a phone book discussion. 
[03:12:00]  Let's get a round table going.  Oh, fuck.  We need a phone book discussion.  I hope you're taking calls on this subject.  You fucking...  A phone book discussion.  I still need my phone book because I want to see what you can do in Gurney.  Gurney.  Discussion, Dennis.  Well, Sam and Palace, the good news is these books showing up on doorsteps all over Sacramento  right now are 100% recyclable.  And now we're going to go to close sight.  Officer Kenny, well, they're very good when questioning a shine because you put it against 
[03:12:30]  his head and it doesn't leave marks.  A shine.  That's so cool.  ...up on doorsteps all over Sacramento right now are 100% recyclable.  So if you don't plan to use it, you can give it a chance at a second life in a recycle bin.  But everybody gets these books every year, whether you want them or not.  And it looks like that is not about to change.  So the phone books are recyclable? 
[03:13:00]  Aren't they fucking paper?  They're fucking paper.  Weren't they always recyclable?  If I buried a phone book a fucking week later, it would be gone in 1972.  What's the fucking point here, you jack-offs?  What are your phone books made of vinyl in Sacramento?  Yeah, we switched from leather to fucking paper phone books.  We found the ones made of cement that weren't disappearing.  Fucking paper from a tree, you dumb twat.  Well, they want to save the trees, I guess.  Oh, your carbon footprint, if I hear that again. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah, I know.  How big is your carbon footprint?  I'm a white guy.  It's very small.  It happens every year at this time.  The march of the AT&T phone books.  The company prints one million of them for Sacramento alone, one copy for every home and business.  But we asked around, who still uses these books?  People don't use the Internet, I guess.  My mom uses them, but she's all hit on the computers.  The directory is still really a big part of our business. 
[03:14:00]  Vanessa Smith from AT&T in Sacramento says the company has no plans to phase out or even scale back phone book distribution.  Our advertisers still find that it's a great way to increase their business and get a lot of referrals from the yellow pages.  The company urges people to recycle their old copies.  Oh my God, they're still talking about this story?  We should let it go.  It's going to go right far.  Holy shit, they're still talking about this?  They're living fucking life at a breakneck pace in Sacramento, huh? 
[03:14:30]  Holy shit.  I was just checking my email.  They're still talking about this, right?  We're going to do 20 minutes on pamphlets tomorrow night.  Join us.  A roundtable discussion on pamphlets.  Yes, we're having a discussion on phone books.  This paper thing that we are discussing is taking off.  We've got to find more paper products to talk about.  Fucking idiots.  Friday night calendars.  Flyers, the work of the Jews.  Dude, I would rather watch the local news than any sitcom that's on TV.  I laugh my ass off every fucking day. 
[03:15:00]  In L.A., they have to close with a fucking story about an animal just to make you feel good.  They'll go from a story, 12 kids died in that fire.  Now, here's the story about the kitten who dialed 911, which is fucking outright lying.  Because some dope told them, you know, you've got to end with something nice.  After all the horrific shit they just showed you.  It's the same mentality like in a movie when they show an animal get thrown off a bridge.  They have to show up and pop up and walk away.  Yeah, yeah.  Why?  You just fucking defeated the purpose.  Oh, by the way, there is more.  This is where many of them go. 
[03:15:30]  The Sacramento Recycling and Transfer Station where the remains of the old books are sorted and compacted.  Oh, hey, you want to order a pizza?  There's no way to tell exactly how many get recycled, but we do know that last year Sacramento Elementary Schools collected 45,000 of the old books as part of an annual incentive program from AT&T and the city.  And they will get credit for those books in terms of money for their supplies.  If you don't want to take it to the school, you can always put it in your blue recycling bin and it'll get to the same place.  Now, there is a 1-800 number on the cover of every phone book where you can... 
[03:16:00]  Are they still talking about this?  What happened?  I think it was a two-hour documentary.  You can drill a hole in it and fill it with warm butter and fuck it.  Many uses for a phone book.  Yes.  Warm butter.  Paint a baby face on it and throw it in a dumpster.  Right.  We get it.  It's a phone book.  Yeah, don't teach the kids math and English.  Have them fucking...  It's not radioactive waste.  It's a fucking phone book.  This is ridiculous that they're still talking about this. 
[03:16:30]  When's California going to go away?  It's a big waste.  Remember of every phone book where you can get information about where to recycle the books,  but here's an interesting statistic.  For one ton of these, to produce one ton of these, takes 7,000 gallons of water and 4,000 kilowatts of electricity.  That's according to the City of Sacramento Waste Services.  Let me just soak in.  This goes longer, Jimmy.  Wait, that's so interesting.  7,000 gallons of water.  It uses 7...  Jimmy.  Jimmy, wake up. 
[03:17:00]  You nodded off.  Jimmy, what happened?  I was just listening to that interesting fact.  And what was it?  What did you learn?  There's something about those kilotons and the whole...  So it's, uh...  How much?  How much electricity?  I didn't pass the test.  I don't know how many of those you have to pile on top of your dick to flatten it completely.  How many phone books on your cock make it go flat?  Like a hammerhead shark.  That's the question I want to...  Where's Arnold Diaz?  Where's that fucking mustachioed PR?  Shame, shame, shame, shame, shame, shame on you. 
[03:17:30]  That guy with that fucking porno mustache and that chemo hairdo.  That looks like he's got two white cells left.  Fucking, oh, we found the lady who got ripped off by Verizon.  Let's take a look.  Show up at my door.  I'll kick you right in the nuts.  You fucking half a girl, you.  He really is a fucking hallmark of cunt.  Yeah, exactly.  Should have a fucking armband on.  Fucking shame, shame, shame.  Shame on your skin.  You look like James Woods' ball sack. 
[03:18:00]  Put on some foundation and a hat before you do the next story.  We hate those fucking guys.  Shame, shame, shame.  Why don't they get beat up?  I was...  I was talking about...  Go ahead.  I got nothing to say.  They just did shame on you stories, but it was all interracial couples.  They bring their parents over.  Shame, shame on you.  Just a big lily white finger pointed at the naughty blonde.  Oh, fuck. 
[03:18:30]  She married a sanitation worker.  Shame, shame, shame on you.  They find the families with the Down Syndrome child.  But it's God's hand pointing at them?  Shame, shame, shame.  Shame on you.  Shame on you when you're pointing at the womb.  Pointing at the sonogram.  Big fucking head in there.  Oh, my God. 
[03:19:00]  He shows up and they're throwing a clothes basket over the kid's head.  Be funny.  You only did shame on you.  You only focus on rape victims.  Shame, shame, shame.  Shame on you.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.  Jimmy.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.  The sonogram looks like a Puffin' Stuff character.  I thought it was shame on Jews.  That's what I thought it was all these years.  They're always ripping us off.  Oh, shit. 
[03:19:30]  Shame, shame on Jews.  All right, more about the phone books.  Interesting statistic.  For one ton of these, to produce one ton of these takes 7,000 gallons of water and 4,000 kilowatts of electricity.  That's according to the City of Sacramento Waste Services.  So there is definitely an environmental aspect to all of these, but the advertisers say they're profitable.  A lot of people we spoke with said they just like thumbing through the book instead of clicking on the computer.  Does it?  No, they don't.  No, they don't.  Is it worth the cost? 
[03:20:00]  I guess they'll determine that.  And then you get the weird let.  Yeah.  Well, it doesn't do it really.  Is it something that we actually would do?  I don't know how many phone books you can roll up like a newspaper and fit in her vag.  Are you a three phone booker?  Fucking.  It's all fucking.  I'll tell you who uses phone books.  Old people.  And comedians on the road.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Looking for horror houses.  Escorts.  I don't bring my left.  I used to always, yeah.  Really? 
[03:20:30]  The phone book?  Oh, yeah.  Did you go out to the phone booth with that little hinged thing?  You're like, yes, on Maple Street Avenue, Gurney.  Gurney.  Gurney.  Right here in Gurney.  You're going to need to go to Gurney.  Holy shit.  Is that funny?  I'm looking for it.  Babe, the big blue ox.  That is Gurney.  You're in Gurney.  You're in California.  They actually believe in all that shit.  Who came up with Slow News Day?  The bit Slow News Day.  Danny.  Yeah.  Another one out of the park.  We want another installment of Slow News Day.  Wow.  Is that fucking funny shit? 
[03:21:00]  Hey, is Big A coming in tomorrow?  I think he's coming in tomorrow or Friday.  Well, tomorrow is Friday.  We don't know.  We don't know?  Trying to get Big A in here.  We're going to give his tongue a nice scraping.  That's disgusting.  His breath is horrific.  Who's Big A?  Do I know him?  You'd know him.  Just a picture up on Big A.  That guy?  From ONAradio.com.  He can't say words that start with S-T.  Is Big A listening?  I'm going to call the show. 
[03:21:30]  You had a kid in there doing some gross shit the last time I was here over there, and his  girlfriend was watching on the bleachers.  Who the fuck was that big?  This is Big A, Nick.  Oh, right.  For your viewing.  Big glute.  Andrew, he's a big sweetie.  I love Andrew.  We really do.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  He's got a mouth under his mouth.  Look at that.  Holy shit.  He accidentally feeds a whole meal into his chin.  He's got like 11 breadsticks in the Olive Garden, tucking to his second chin.  He had a huge tumor removed from his neck.  You would think-  Are you serious? 
[03:22:00]  Yes.  What, do you have it replaced with a tumor?  He traded tumors.  Sorry, Big A.  He looks like a fucking eagle who hasn't shit in about a week.  He's actually a male nurse.  He was known as the infant biter.  That does look like one of those-  He should be famous.  Wanted posters.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's like for just the most awful type of rape.  That's what it looks like.  Chin rape.  This man was seen.  We're going to scrape his tongue, though. 
[03:22:30]  Nick, you do that tongue scraping stuff?  Not since I quit gay sex, no.  What is it?  How does that work?  They sell these little spoon contraptions, and you just scrape your tongue.  What am I looking for, exactly?  Keeps the bad breath away.  And what comes up, what collects on the spoon is quite interesting.  Yellowish.  Greenish.  I brush my tongue.  There's a bit of brown in there, and we're going to have someone swallow the contents. 
[03:23:00]  No, you're not.  Hell yeah.  You've got to be shitting me.  Or at the very least, maybe do another mustache.  Oh, we got Big A?  Big A!  Big A, what's up?  Nothing much.  How's everybody?  We're good, Big A.  We really want you to come in for that tongue scraping.  You sound like his doctor.  Yeah.  Yeah, we really need you to come in for the tongue scraping. 
[03:23:30]  We're going to try to come in tomorrow.  I haven't found out if I can take off yet, but...  Does he have a tongue?  Yeah, we're going to get a garden hoe, actually, to get at that tongue.  Big A!  That's fucking gross.  I know it's demeaning, but we really need you for another bit.  We want to, you know, scrape your tongue, and then we might make mustaches or something  with the goop.  Look at Jimmy.  Look at Jimmy.  Oh, my God. 
[03:24:00]  Look at Jimmy.  The goop.  The goop.  You should put him in those little tartar sauce containers.  Put him next to a sandwich.  Are you in, Big A?  A sandwich.  Oh, yes, I am.  All right.  So you're going to scrape.  Now, the thing is, don't try to gussy yourself up by brushing your teeth or doing, you know,  anything like that.  You got to, you know, just come in like you would normally come in.  What?  You expect him to buy a toothbrush between now and tomorrow? 
[03:24:30]  I don't like all this knocking of Big A.  Oh, I'm sorry, Big A.  I forgot you were still on the phone.  And also, everything's in the program, also, Opie.  What happened?  I was listening to the program, also.  Oh, he was listening to the whole show.  Oh, okay.  Called it a program.  A program.  What are you going to do later, Mike Douglas?  I'm going to watch my stories.  You all right, Big A?  Is he all right?  Is he all right?  Big A, what's up today? 
[03:25:00]  All right.  I'm a little tired.  You don't sound it.  You sound like you're full of pissing vinegar or whatever.  Yeah.  Thanks a lot.  Hey, Big A, what's pissing you off today?  The fact that he has to have his tongue straight next week.  Nothing, man.  I'm just tired.  No, but, like, you know, this life thing is tough.  Like, everyone has something that pisses them off.  What's your thing today?  What's annoying the hell out of you?  Turtleneck.  Traffic. 
[03:25:30]  Traffic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you driving?  Yes.  Traffic.  Traffic.  Traffic.  Where are you right now?  Well, I'm back in the Bronx.  Right now.  I wasn't in Manhattan before.  You're in the Bronx and the traffic is what's bothering you?  Do people bother you in the Bronx?  Nobody bothers me. 
[03:26:00]  No.  Yeah, it's probably, like, bad luck.  Yeah.  Don't fuck with them, man.  Don't fuck with them.  You don't pester a stegosaurus.  All right, Piggy, we're going to get you in here tomorrow, right?  Hopefully.  Yeah, hopefully, yeah.  I'll call them.  How's the eyebrows?  Are they growing in yet?  Not really.  Yeah, we shaved his eyebrows.  You know, eyebrows...  Jesus.  Eyebrows do have this weird thing where it's not like a hair on your head.  It tastes forever.  And sometimes it doesn't grow back. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  Sometimes they just don't grow back.  Yeah.  You can draw them in, though.  Yeah, pencil them in.  That'll look great.  The brick red Crayola Crayola.  Have, like...  Actually, use something water-soluble and carry around the marker and a washcloth so you  can change your emotions really quickly.  Like, I'm so mad.  Dude, let's do that tomorrow.  We'll do...  Okay.  A fucking Sharpie and a roll of Bounty.  Here's tomorrow's bit.  This...  You know, since we got back from vacation, it's all about bits every day.  Oh, of course.  Tomorrow's bit is eyebrow fun with Big A. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah.  It'll be like that game with the magnetized...  He almost looks like that guy.  Right, right.  The magnetic dust and the metal dust and you gotta kind of arrange hair and a mustache  and fucking eyebrows.  Let's have a competition to see who can come up with the best eyebrows for Big A.  We'll pencil them in.  Okay.  Eyebrow fun with Big A on the Daphne and Anthony show.  I wanna make Mr. Spock eyebrows on him.  Just those pointy ones.  Yeah.  And then I wanna put, like, the, uh... 
[03:27:30]  How about, like, the old Joan Crawford ones?  Tina!  Big arches.  I hate when these fuckers are onto us.  Bobby D from Brockton.  Come on, Opie.  Keep reaching.  It's not quite 11 yet.  Look, we're trying.  Hey, motherfucker.  We gave you four and a half solid hours of radio today.  Yeah.  Deal with it.  All right, Big A, we'll see you soon, okay?  Yeah, definitely.  Bye-bye, Andrew.  Bye-bye.  Where do you find a guy like Big A?  It was the oddest thing. 
[03:28:00]  We were doing the, um...  We're playing targets.  Jurassic Park.  Exactly.  Fun of the Museum of Natural Science.  Leaning against a wall.  On the business end of a dead prostitute.  Oh, fuck, Jimmy.  Great line, and it reminded me of something.  They did our bit on TV.  What?  I actually read it on Whackbag.  I had no idea.  Could you get Whackbag up?  They did the dead hooker bit.  What bit? 
[03:28:30]  Nick, one of our favorite bits to do is the dead hooker bit, where like a businessman, he  goes on the road, hasn't had sex with his wife in a long time, figures he could get away  with one.  We're talking about the guy that's deciding, you know, I'm going to just get away with  one.  Yeah.  Elliot Spitzer.  Hires up a hooker.  She comes to the hotel, and something horrific happens, and now the hooker's dead, and the  phone's ringing.  It's the wife giving you the update on the kids, and you're trying to figure out how to  get rid of the dead hooker.  There's a dead hooker right there. 
[03:29:00]  And then it's like, oh.  They did that on American Idol.  What's the bit?  Who stole it from you?  Not that it was stolen, but was it CSI or something?  Law and Order Criminal Intent.  Oh, Criminal Intent.  Ripped from the headlines, right?  And was he like talking on the phone with his wife while the dead hooker was laying there?  Sitting on the dead hooker.  That's correct.  But dude, then we're like.  Dick's still in the dead hooker.  Yeah, honey, I'll be home.  I got to call you back.  And then we went further with the bit.  I mean, this bit took all day, but then all of a sudden the guy's wearing like a bunny 
[03:29:30]  suit, because that's his fetish, but he's got the head off the bunny suit as he's crying,  and the hooker's dead on the floor.  Why is he crying?  Because he's just thinking his career is shot.  His career, his family life.  How does he tell his wife?  So then he starts getting these harebrained schemes of how he can get rid of the hooker.  So he's just sawing her in the bathtub and crying, because this is horrific to him.  He's just a business guy who wanted to get fucked.  And there he is sawing her legs off and crying. 
[03:30:00]  And just disgusting things are happening, because he doesn't really know how to do it.  Her intestines are falling out.  And he's just full of blood.  Yeah, he's leaving evidence everywhere, and he's trying to like, he's doing things out  of order.  Like the body's laying there, just mutilated.  And he gets like blood handprints on the wall, and he's rubbing it off already, but  there's blood everywhere.  And his wife's like, say hi to Tommy.  He got an A in front.  Tommy, how are you doing, Dad?  He'll be home soon.  He's crying, just blood. 
[03:30:30]  He knows the blood is seeping through the floor.  He's wondering if it's dripping into the next room.  Oh, it's just blood everywhere.  We're trying to sell this to Comedy Central, by the way.  Everywhere.  Why not?  Yeah, we got a great idea, and we need someone to listen to us.  I think they animated this bit as well.  But what was the Law and Order episode about?  It was kind of similar.  According to this gentleman, Mayor Menino on Wackbag, the poor bastard at the beginning  of the show meets up with a hooker, and in the morning wakes up, and she's dead, and 
[03:31:00]  there's a picture of him lying next to her dead.  Wait, a picture of him, oh, lying next to her?  Dead.  Okay.  Well, good thing this was with us, Senator.  Yeah, exactly.  I don't know what happened.  That's pretty much it.  It'll be like, she's got no one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's got no one.  Don't worry.  We'll take care of it.  She's got no one.  Like, it never happened.  Oh, dude, our scenario just keeps going and going.  Oh, man.  Just going.  The maid is knocking on the door, and you know you only have a certain amount of time  to figure out how to get the maid to go. 
[03:31:30]  Got to do not disturb on that goddamn thing for a week.  Yes.  Mr. Robertson, you're checking out today?  I'll need the room a little.  Can I have a late check?  Check out?  Check out.  Check out.  Check out.  Check out.  Check out.  Check out.  Check out.  Check out.  Check out.  Check out.  Check out.  I need a late check out.  Check out.  The cell phone is vibrating on the fucking desk.  I need a late check out.  The fucking car service is beeping in front of the hotel. 
[03:32:00]  Yes.  Oh, Jesus.  You're trying to shove the body into your suitcase open.  Hoping you could carry 125.  Oh, God.  What's that?  Oh, God.  Are you checking anything today?  The girl's foot is sticking up.  Put it up on that fucking conveyor belt.  You see the fucking fat ankle with a pop on it.  But the beauty of the bit is the guy's like, he turned 40, 50.  He's like, one time.  Just one thing.  He's going to do it.  One time.  It goes horribly wrong.  He thought about it for so fucking long.  And any other day, it would have been fine. 
[03:32:30]  He picked the wrong day, the wrong hooker.  Loving wife, everything.  And it almost has nothing to do with him.  She just OD'd.  Well, yeah.  No, yeah.  She had like fucking blocked artery.  Yeah.  Some diabetes.  Had nothing to do with him fucking.  She just fucking died.  He didn't do anything.  But he panics because, hey, what's he going to do?  He's got a wife and kid.  Exactly.  So he's got to cut her up and then try to get her out of the hotel.  It's like one of those dreams.  You have a dream like that.  It gets worse and worse. 
[03:33:00]  Thank God.  Blood everywhere.  It's got to be.  And he's trying to cut her up and clean the blood up at the same time.  Someone's reminding us because we go back to this bit.  Because we're trying to like perfect it into the perfect bit.  They're reminding us that not only is he wearing the bunny suit, it's bloody.  There's blood all over the bunny suit.  Oh, yeah, where it gets kinky and he figured he'd try out some kink.  So he puts on a bunny suit and the bunny suit's just covered in blood.  Someone's calling us hacks. 
[03:33:30]  Chris from work.  He says, you're a bunch of hacks.  1998 movie called Very Bad Things was exactly your hooker scenario.  No clue.  Was it?  No idea.  Never heard of it.  What was it called?  Very Bad Things?  A movie called Very Bad Things?  Oh, that's right.  With De Niro.  I should have known.  Seriously?  No.  Danny?  It's with Christian Slater.  I don't get on core.  It's a guy's bachelor party and he's fucking the hooker and kills her completely by accident.  It wasn't like a dangerous thing.  Oh, okay.  I remember that.  Yeah, okay.  He goes to put her up against the wall.  Yeah, but there's a bunch of guys involved. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah, but only one of them was fucking her.  He was the only one that had the balls to go and fuck her.  Yeah, but didn't they all get involved in the disposal of her body?  Yeah, because they panicked.  See, this is one guy and he doesn't know what the fuck to do and he's married.  Right.  You know, come on, cut us some slack.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, I would, you know.  You guys are fucking ripping people off.  Yeah, we're horrid.  Tommy Cleveland.  Hey, Ope, can you give our new site a mention on the air?  We would love to get more members.  We are the guys that keep attacking the Maxwell Show. 
[03:34:30]  We have a new surprise for Fat Boy.  They're still going at it.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  I love it.  It doesn't stop.  Just keep going on them.  Not funny.  The ONAvirus.com.  Is that a site that is being cool to us or what?  I don't know.  Who knows these days?  I read one website and, you know, the news broke.  It was a press release that we're doing a pilot for Comedy Central and, like, the first  20 posts were them making fun of the fact that we're doing a show for Comedy Central.  It's like, and you call yourselves a fan site?  What?  I don't, what? 
[03:35:00]  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  Fuckers.  But the Maxwell stuff is still going strong, Jimmy.  Nat Vinny.  You'd be proud of the boys.  Fat Jewish guy.  Nat Vinny.  I think they've posted pamphlets all over Cleveland now.  I mean, they're just going all out.  This one guy, he's like, I think his name is psychotic on MySpace.  He sent me some cool ones.  Links.  Fucking, this kid's organized.  I listen to audio.  Eat a bullet mentions.  They just fucking won't stop bothering this fucking asshole cunt guy in Cleveland. 
[03:35:30]  And they should keep bothering him.  He's a cunt.  He really is.  Didn't you guys, like, blow up his, you sent so many.  Oh, yeah.  His MySpace.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  We'll give the onavirus.com a little plug today.  See what they're all about.  Just want the websites to be about the show.  Yeah.  They don't even bother.  Go to myspace.com Jim Norton.  It's the best message board.  Really?  Yeah.  What I do is, all new friends, I send $10 in cash to. 
[03:36:00]  You do not.  I do it as a crispy 10.  You do not.  And also, I want to acknowledge radiogoldfans.com because they got their 10th member overnight.  So congratulations to those guys.  They're doing wonderful.  Time for line of the day.  Nick, I imagine you're going to have a few in here, my friend.  I wouldn't bet on it.  I'm fucking exhausted today.  I got nothing.  Nick's going to have a bunch.  Definitely had something.  I'm going to do this now. 
[03:36:30]  This is my new bit.  Nick's going to have a bunch.  Anthony's going to have line of the day.  It's brought to you by Bodog Fantasy Sports.  I'll have one.  Oh, Norton had a ton.  Jimmy, you got a...  I'll have one.  You got the runner-up, I believe.  It was a doozy.  But Ant had one that I would be very surprised as a lot of the day.  Competitions make me nervous.  I know.  I'm still like six runner-ups.  BodogFantasySports.net.  If you're a fantasy baseball player, then make sure to log on to Bodog to get the edge this year.  It's free and they offer public and private leagues and a variety of ways to play.  Fastest growing fantasy experience in the country. 
[03:37:00]  BodogFantasySports.net.  Play one.  Okay.  She married a sanitation worker.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you.  They find the families with the Down Syndrome child.  Whoa.  Hey there.  That was a nice little surprise.  Downs always seems to get into the line of the day.  I know that was easy.  Whether it's the mohair cut, the big tongue.  Hey, Frank from Manhattan, ONA, you're forgetting his failed attempt to flush the bunny suit down 
[03:37:30]  the toilet while the dead hooker stares mockingly from the tub.  That's a good one.  It's a nice visual from the bloody overflow.  We forgot.  Yeah, the dead eyes are just staring at you.  Oh, God.  Hey, what did I miss?  Do you cut the head off first and then put it somewhere so it's just looking at you?  And then he gets all upset and turns it around toward the wall.  Or he puts a face cloth over it?  You put it in your ice bucket and put it out in the hallway. 
[03:38:00]  Leave it for room service.  Yeah, just housekeeping.  Just the dead eyes just with that dead stare.  I was just trying to figure out what the fuck to do next.  Next are a couple Parker rolls.  All right, here's another runner-up line of the day.  They are big and they are yellow, but apparently they are not very green.  The free-fomb books that you get a kiss. 
[03:38:30]  And gurney.  She slammed the limo door on her own fucking pink sock asshole.  Her pink sock and dragged it like a jacket sleeve hanging out someone's fucking car door.  And she jumped and went, ow, it pinches.  That pink sleeve.  I think these guys decide to do line of the day starting at 10 o'clock.  I think so, too.  In the last few minutes.  Very suspicious in how they put this together.  That's it.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Really?  Jimmy's. 
[03:39:00]  It was quite brilliant, bud.  The pillowcase is like 51 flavors.  Nick DiPaolo.  Caroline's tonight right here in New York City.  You will not be disappointed, my friends.  And go to nickdip.com, could you?  I don't know why, but just go.  It's a brand new site.  He spent a ton of money on it.  Blog TV, right?  Blog TV, too.  April 1st at 4 o'clock and April 2nd at 9 p.m.  So what, you're just talking to a camera?  Yeah.  And if you have a webcam, I click on you. 
[03:39:30]  You're my co-host.  It's a fucking blast, actually.  That's kind of cool.  No, it is.  It's really cool, man.  And, you know, what else?  It's this.  Caroline's tonight's a big one.  8 p.m.  Come on out, folks.  We're going to do Jägermeister shots.  It'll be terrific.  I'm selling Dave Chappelle CDs after the show.  Yeah, there you go.  G-Man from Charlotte, North Carolina, writes,  The old man leaves the room, back to the hooker thing,  sees a happy family on a family vacation by the pool,  reminding him of his happy family.  His family. 
[03:40:00]  That he'll never see again.  I don't know why, but we love that fucking scenario.  It's such tragedy.  Right.  And so much trouble.  Like, he's in so much trouble.  So you've got to get so many details in there  so you can really appreciate, like, the character.  And just the stress you would feel just attempting to make it all go away.  That's the beauty of it.  You know he can't just disappear.  Right.  And you're not even worried at that point about going to jail at your fucking wife. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah, you're thinking about the wife.  She's going to rip your nuts off.  You don't care about going to jail the rest of your life.  It's a cranky bitch.  Imagine you do get away with it,  but you leave, like, one dumb thing behind.  A stupid, like, fake fingernail or something.  Something would get him, yeah.  Because he's not experienced.  He can't clean up fucking evidence.  The guy's an idiot.  He's just trying to get a fucking hooker one night.  You sneak out at, like, you know, like, three in the morning down to the lobby  and you try to put her head in a fireplace for him, a fake fireplace. 
[03:41:00]  You got it in an ice bucket.  You got the lid on the...  They totally catch him like William H. Macy in Fargo.  Right.  Okay.  Be right there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  One minute.  And then they bust in.  He's trying to get out the window.  No!  No!  No!  He hears this kid upstairs or something, right?  Oh, and he's doing that one.  Oh, his fucking father-in-law's dead in the trunk.  Yeah.  I love that.  Yeah, he doesn't have the money.  He doesn't have his wife.  And he's just like, yeah, okay. 
[03:41:30]  No, I think I'm going to go to bed.  Well, the first thing you do is call your wife, try to stay calm, and go, I have to  stay another day in Minnesota.  Yeah.  Or wherever.  Yeah.  Columbus.  They edit a Sunday night show.  Right.  Right.  And go, all right, now I got 24 more hours to figure this fucking thing out.  You're on the rooftop of the hotel like De Niro in Godfather 2.  You got 19 pieces.  You put them down fucking vent pipes.  That sounds like toilet pipes. 
[03:42:00]  I'm glad Nick is here to help us with our scenario.  Hands and feet.  You just spend the first, like, couple of hours on the side of the bed crying, not wanting  to touch the dead body that's under the sheets.  Yeah, the panic.  I think I would start, like, just cutting the hair and flushing the toilet.  Just see how much stuff I could flush down the toilet.  That would be my first move.  Cutting the hair.  Whatever.  Oh, that's a good one.  Just yelling, like, blameful things at the corpse.  You're just yelling at, why? 
[03:42:30]  You should have said you couldn't breathe.  What happened?  You've ruined my fucking life.  You've ruined my fucking life.  Because no one's going to look for a hooker.  You bitch!  The beauty of this is no one's going to look for the hooker.  So all your job is to make this disappear.  Here.  Every body piece.  But it's one of those motel type hotels, too.  It's like a seedy thing.  So you can't just carry it out.  Once you're out, you're in the parking lot.  Yeah, but the pimp doesn't want to be involved.  He's like, fuck, I just lost one. 
[03:43:00]  So what do you do with the body parts?  What's this son of a bitch going to do?  I told you you flush as much as you can down the toilet.  You don't have to cut it up into chunks like dinty more stew.  No, but you start that way.  But as soon as you decide to cut a finger off and flush that, now the bleeding starts.  Or you know what else is good?  You have a lot of blood.  And then you try something too big, and it gets stuck and backs up the toilet.  And bloody water overflows.  So now you need to find a mob.  Now you don't have a plunger.  And you know part of her hand is jammed in the toilet. 
[03:43:30]  Hi, this is Mr. Apollo in 301.  Is this the front desk?  Yeah.  Do you guys have a Cuisinart?  Or a food processor?  Yeah.  And a couple blenders.  These fucking guys get it too.  Flying standby from Virginia.  The guy's first reaction is to put the do not disturb tag on the outside of the door,  thinking that will buy him some more time.  That's funny.  And leaves like bloody fingerprints on there because he thinks of it later.  So you try to get body parts past the front desk. 
[03:44:00]  You have to try to get the body parts outside.  Cutting your balls off like, just going outside, just going for some lunch.  Yeah, you wait till late at night, and you throw her over your shoulder, and you bring  her out, prop her up in a lunch here next to the pool, and get the fuck out of there.  He thinks of that after she's already all cut up.  I got to put her back together.  Yeah, he's got this great idea, but she's all fucking cut up now.  And now he's trying to put her back together.  Oh, shit.  Fucking A, man. 
[03:44:30]  I love this guy.  Another runner off the line of the day.  A lot of muscle to hold that head up there that high, I guess.  It's not a big head, though.  No, a little peanut head.  Stupid head with those dumb little antennas.  Yeah.  What the hell those horns on their head are all about?  Their hats don't fall off.  They should put them in the tent so that their fedoras don't slip off.  Their hooves can't pick them up.  That's a great visual.  Fucking giraffe in a fedora with his little horns holding it on is fantastic.  That might be a Coke Logic animation right there. 
[03:45:00]  Hey, details on our animation festival are coming very soon.  We're almost ready to give you all the details.  Jimmy, I interrupted.  Oh, that's fine.  Okay.  I was just looking at his fedora and looking at his hooves and going, ah, fuck.  Once it happens, it's unfixable.  It fell off.  Another giraffe walks by with his fedora and kind of chuckles at him.  Yeah.  That's what happens when you try to pick up some grass.  Fucking fedora on a giraffe.  Fedora.  And not even just a regular old hat. 
[03:45:30]  No kidding.  What else?  What do we got?  Line of the day?  One more runner-up line of the day.  I straddled Nancy Reagan's chest and titty fucker until they both fell off.  Ronald Reagan put his colon on my mouth and I ate it out.  I scalp-fucked John F. Kennedy in Dallas in the early 60s.  A fag-zelic guy.  Zeltwink. 
[03:46:00]  God, we should have played What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show today.  It's all in the last hour.  Very, very informational.  So, well, and then people will go on a message board and say that we call it in over here.  Yeah, we did.  Yeah.  That's right.  Obviously.  Obviously, we did.  It's like McNeil Lair over here.  Extremely obvious.  Nick, thank you so much.  Guys, you're the best.  You're very generous.  Thank you, Nick.  You brought me in here so much and I appreciate it.  Great addition to the program.  Absolutely.  It really is. 
[03:46:30]  Come to Caroline's, folks, if you live in the tri-state area.  Yeah.  Tonight, 8 p.m.  This would be a little awkward, but I'm trying to find someone to fill in for Jimmy, but  I'm not sure if we have the dude.  See, Nick would have been perfect.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are you doing tomorrow, Nick?  Want to be on standby?  Tomorrow's Friday?  Tomorrow?  What's today?  Yeah, I'm around.  Steve, who's filling in for Jimmy?  I'm around, if you need me. 
[03:47:00]  Rich is definitely?  All right.  Tell Rich to stay home.  Hey, we have pal-talk cameras, Nick.  I'm kidding.  I fucking love it.  You're talking about Rich Franchese, right?  I just want to let you know.  I'm Voss.  I like Voss.  He's funny.  Oh, Voss is going to be so disappointed.  He's clicked down another night.  Well, you've been on here enough.  Come on, I'm playing catch up here.  I say we have a little, another day with Nick tomorrow.  Maybe, maybe... 
[03:47:30]  I don't want to cause any hurt feelings.  How about we do this?  We make Voss get up nice and early.  Nick, you sleep in.  When you roll out of bed, you come in.  Oh, tag team.  Why not?  It's Friday.  As long as he's cleared the building.  All right, we'll figure that out.  We got to do line of the day.  BodogFantasySports.net.  Check that out.  Line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day. 
[03:48:00]  Line of the day.  Where did it all go wrong for you, Nick?  I don't know that it has all.  What sense?  Brown versus Board of Education.  Oh, Norton said that.  I want to kiss more guys.  Oh.  Sam, enough about the guys.  Sam.  Holy shit, Jimmy.  I apologize.  I thought that was going to be runner-up line of the day, and I thought Ant was going to  get it with the Oscar De La Hoya thing.  What was your De La Hoya line?  That fucking... 
[03:48:30]  Oh, with the gloves.  When he was talking about wearing the heavyweight gloves, and I go, Oscar De La Hoya was wearing  a little black number up to the elbow.  Yeah.  But that's okay.  I don't know.  I think some of those...  Ah, that's all right.  Oh, Jimmy.  Yeah, no.  Oh, I don't know.  I think some of those were...  And we made it to 11!  All right.  Yeah!  Let's go to Gurney and get a beer.  We got to get out of here.  Jimmy is hitting the road.  Seattle, the Moore Theater, I'm there Friday night, and then...  Don't bring that up now.  Portland, I'm not sure where. 
[03:49:00]  Seattle?  Yeah, Seattle.  You're going to Seattle?  I am, and I'm then taking a train to Portland, and I will be...  I forget the name of the theater in Portland.  Newmark Theater.  Oh, Newmark Theater in Portland, Oregon.  I know everything.  I did an opi word today, too.  Informational.  Informational?  Yeah.  All right.  I don't understand.  Mark that down.  Daddy has to tinkle.  I'll see you guys.  All right.  See you Monday.  Break a leg there, big boy.  Jimmy.  All right.  Bye, guys.  Bye, Kenny.  Take it easy, Kenny. 
[03:49:30]  I have a nice weekend.  You too, Kenny.  Look at him.  He's just giant and stupid.  Monster.  He really is.  With very dry hair.  Realize how big those other guys were, though.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Giants.  Fuck.  You think they're his guys, or you think they're the WWE guys?  Oh, that's a good question, too.  I think they're...  Those are his.  Yeah.  How do you know?  You could just tell.  How do you know, Steve?  You could tell me, guys.  Because I was talking to the guy from the WWE who told me that he's got a nine-guy entourage. 
[03:50:00]  But he would tell you.  He would say that to keep the gimmick going.  I don't think so.  You don't think they're professional wrestlers or guys that want to be wrestlers?  They're giant guys.  I think boxy.  That they hired.  I think he can afford to have an entourage of eight guys following him around.  But they're going to be in the ring doing all these things.  Wouldn't it be more convenient if he had that entourage?  I don't know.  Steve, whenever Steve says it's real, it's fake.  Whenever he says it's fake, it's real.  True is false.  False is true. 
[03:50:30]  You're like one of those fucking things that screw up every machine on Star Trek.  If it's logical, then it is illogical to think it's logical.  And then it smokes and Kirk fucks a green woman.  Turn off the lights and you guys are done.  Okay.  Actually, I have to get out of here.  I have very important business.  Thanks, Nick.  At the homestead.  Fellas, thank you so much.  We don't do professional radio endings anymore.  No, we just kind of let it fucking peter out. 
[03:51:00]  Yeah, just put your coat on and leave.  Yeah, that's the fucking hip way to do it.  It's like showing up late for a party.  It's very...  I don't know what the fuck that meant.  I gotta get out of here before I hurt my career.  I've been holding a piss since fucking four o'clock this month.  Oh, push that button.  I want to kiss more guys.  Hobie and Anthony are the latest shock jocks to hit it big.  God damn!  They are heavily into one thing.  Boobies.  Boobies.  Yes. 
[03:51:30]  One of you, I don't know which one, said, then you can pull out your business.  It's junk.  We're artists.  You presented as innocent, but I'm not so sure it is.  Screw you.  We're artists.  Is there anything you won't do for ratings?  We are publicity whorebags.  Publicity sluts.  We're artists.  This is all about money.  That's what it comes down to.  Because you're mercenaries.  That's clever.  Aren't you mercenaries?  We're radio mercenaries, dickhead.  We're artists.  We're entertainers.  We're not psychologists.  We're not doctors.  We're not daycare workers.  We're artists.  So it's all on appearance.  None on you.  None on us.  We're artists. 
[03:52:00]  None on us.  We're an Anthony.  I'm scared.  I'm scared.  I'm scared. </pre>
