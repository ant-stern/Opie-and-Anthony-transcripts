<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a discussion about comedian Artie Lange's experiences with the Ron and Paul show on Miami's Big 106, a classic rock station.  This led to a broader conversation about comedian Aerie Spears' disastrous interview on the same show.  Spears, from *MadTV*, had apparently been criticized on-air after leaving the studio, prompting his return to confront the hosts.  This set the stage for a discussion about the often-harsh treatment of comedians by radio hosts.

A significant portion of the segment, however, was unexpectedly dominated by Opie's ongoing saga of a piece of studio equipment repeatedly falling on his foot.  This resulted in much laughter and frustrated commentary from Opie, with the other hosts and guest comedian Bob Kelly joining in the ribbing.  Bob Kelly's presence in the studio briefly shifted the conversation to his hybrid car and his opinions on California.  The hosts also mentioned other comedians, including the one they described as "psychotic," Dan Natterman, and Dan Cook, who also had a negative radio experience in Miami.  A listener, Ryan, called in to express a mixture of sympathy and mocking disbelief regarding Opie's foot injury.

A substantial portion of the segment was dedicated to playing and reacting to audio of Aerie Spears' explosive confrontation with the Miami radio hosts. This audio prompted further discussion about the perceived blandness and homogenization of many commercial radio personalities.  The hosts continued to dissect Spears' performance, employing the word "diddly" to describe it, along with various other off-color jokes and comments, ultimately ending the segment with lingering commentary on the confrontation.

[00:02:00]  VIOLIN PLAYS  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  All of it is so bad, it's hard to tell which is the worst.  The absolute worst.  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's absolutely awful.  Hey, we've got to get Martini Steven here, too, because we've got a couple of comedians in the studio, and you guys have done a lot of radio shows, so we definitely want you guys involved in this next little piece of tape we found. 
[00:05:00]  Steve knows the back history of this.  One of the dudes from Mad TV, I think you know him, was on a radio show down in Miami, and he wasn't that funny.  Yeah.  And I give the radio show a lot of credit.  And I give the radio show a lot of credit.  They called him out after he left his studio and said how much he sucked.  And this guy heard the whole thing and came running back in the studio and started a fight with the guys.  Oh, he's doing some laps around the studio.  Whoa! 
[00:05:30]  Yes, Steve?  What are you doing?  Steve!  Tread, tread, tread apart.  Steve!  Steve!  You can't find a parking spot because now we've got Bob in here.  Bob, move over.  There you go.  Bob's moving over.  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  Wow.  Finally.  Thank God.  It's very crowded in here.  That's his hybrid car that he drives.  Bob?  Is he really a hybrid car?  Look at it.  I've had one for about a year now.  Why?  It's right in front of you, Bob.  That's what everyone says.  You make enough money to pay for gas like a human being? 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  What do you put in it?  What else do you put in it?  Electricity?  It runs on honey, water, and bees.  It's a hybrid.  Part cock, part mouth.  You can have a hook or crap in it.  I love my car.  What does it run on, honestly?  Electricity?  Yeah, it runs on half.  The combustion engine fuels the battery.  So you don't really have to plug it in or anything.  It just constantly goes.  If he goes to, like, accelerate on an on-ramp, it's the gas motor.  But then once he's up to highway speed, the gas motor shuts off, and it turns into the 
[00:06:30]  battery-powered.  Right.  Electric.  It just goes.  Electric.  So you get, you know, roughly 60 miles an hour.  So you have gas in it, just that you don't have...  Yeah, you have a...  It's like a lawnmower.  Yeah, you've got a 10-gallon gas tank, and ultimately you get 400 miles to the tank.  Jesus.  But you can only go 60 miles an hour.  No, no, no.  60 miles per gallon.  I'm sorry.  I misspoke.  How fucked up is that?  His brakes charge the battery.  You don't look like the type of guy that would give a shit about the universe. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, well, I generally wouldn't until I realized the gas was going to hit three bucks  a gallon.  It's the universe of his wallet.  So you don't have enough...  The money was killing you.  Yeah.  It was really just filling up an SUV.  I had a huge GMC envoy.  What?  What do you have now?  What's it now?  Where is it?  Enough.  What is it now?  What is it called?  What?  The car I have?  It's a Toyota Prius.  The Prius.  They have the faggiest names for those hybrids, too.  A Prius.  It's the Toyota Prius.  I'm driving a Prius.  I'm driving a Toyota Prius.  It's kind of like penis. 
[00:07:30]  Almost.  But that is cool.  They would definitely sell more if they had a manly name for the damn thing.  Look, they're coming out with the Highlander...  Jimmy.  Don't be shy.  Just talk.  The Highlander...  Jesus.  All right, fine.  Get it over with.  There's nothing.  There's nothing going on down there.  There's a penis.  No, just a shirt.  Prius.  There's no bulge there.  No, there really isn't.  That's why you should call your penis the Prius.  You can't see it, but it's there.  Why did I walk in here?  You didn't.  You drove it.  You're a Prius.  All right, so what's up with this Miami classic rock station? 
[00:08:00]  Aerie Spears, who's on Mad TV, was on the Ron and Paul show on Big 106, and I guess they  didn't really like his performance.  He didn't do any impressions, and he wasn't really funny.  So after he walked out of the station, they started bashing him on air, and he heard it  in the car and came running back in and picked a fight with them on air.  Aerie Spears, I haven't seen him in many, many years.  He actually, I remember when I was doing open mics at a place called Arbidjons in, what 
[00:08:30]  was it?  It was Jersey.  It was right around where I lived, East Brunswick, some hotel that had a bar, and Aerie's mother  would bring him in, because he was young.  He was like, he's from North Brunswick.  I think he was like 16 or 15, so he couldn't go in by himself legally, so his mom would bring  him in, and he would do open mics and stuff.  How did he do it, like 16?  He was funny.  He did impressions.  I mean, back then, I mean, again, I was new, and he was.  He started, I think I'm a little bit before him, but not much, and I haven't seen him.  Last time I saw him was when I bombed at East Orange after the Rodney King beating.  I did a black crowd after the Rodney King beating, and it was, it wasn't like, I was 
[00:09:00]  just awful, and I wasn't ready to do that kind of room, and then Bob Levy goes out and  starts destroying until he sees a black cop, and he goes, why don't you take a nightstick  and hit yourself with it, and then he lost the crowd.  Oh, that drunk, Bob has balls.  What an ass.  Oh, he has balls.  That lost the crowd?  Yeah, but Ares went on, and Bill Bellamy was hosting.  That's the last time I saw Ares Spears.  That's whatever, 10 years ago.  And I guess he went on this show and didn't perform?  Does he do well on MADtv? 
[00:09:30]  I don't know.  Yeah, he does.  Yeah, he does.  I've seen him.  He's the black dude, right?  Yes.  Yeah.  He's pretty funny, man.  He does pretty funny Shaq.  Yeah, Shaq.  He does MC Hammer.  He does that Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown thing.  He's kind of funny.  I met him one time at the Carolines.  He was kind of weird, though.  He's kind of cool.  You know what I mean?  You meet a guy like that.  Hey, what's up?  He's almost like a rapper.  Yeah, he doesn't want to be wacky like a comic.  He wants to have a cool rock star attitude.  Now, I want to know if these guys in Florida, because Dan Natterman had a problem where he 
[00:10:00]  went on a station like this, bombed, didn't do well, and then they trashed him when he  left.  And so Natterman called in.  And I've heard the tape online.  It's really funny, because they smashed him.  But again, you know how it is.  You're in a no-win situation when you're calling from the car.  I'm like, Dan, why did you call?  He's like, I was angry.  He has a problem.  Oh, he's like, Dan's a fucking problem.  And he actually threatened.  He said something about he wanted the building to blow up, or he said something really terrorist  oriented.  Oh, Jesus.  Maybe one of the interns could find that online.  When are we going to get Dan in here? 
[00:10:30]  Dude, I wanted to have him in.  I got his, let's try for, I don't know, tomorrow.  I love that guy.  Because I leave Wednesday, so maybe I'll have him tomorrow.  Psychotic.  He is psychotic.  Try to get him in tomorrow, because he is psychotic.  That's the best tasting pickle I've ever had.  Yeah, Dan is a sociopath.  He's a weird dude.  And he creeps girls out.  Oh, he's the greatest.  Oh, who touched you?  You know, Dan's a fucking classic.  We were in the last comic standing.  I'm standing next to him as they're picking up people, and they're not picking him.  And he just kept going, Bobby, it's going to be a fucking bloodbath, I swear to God.  My name isn't called very soon. 
[00:11:00]  People are going to die.  All right.  So these guys started to move on with their show after this bad interview with him.  Dan Cook had a problem down there, too.  He walked out on one of those.  I don't know if it was his, but he-  Well, you guys do a lot of radio.  It's not easy.  Out in Miami.  It's not easy to walk into a lot of these shows and just be funny, because a bunch of  these guys are just the tools, right?  Yeah, these guys just walked in.  He goes, he ignored them when he walked in.  I don't know anything about this show, but I've heard the stories over the years from you  guys.  And it's like, you know, you're walking into an environment where they're like, hey, Bob, what's 
[00:11:30]  going on?  And then you have to be funny in that environment.  Yeah, you have to do your act.  It's got to be tough.  What show is this?  That's the exact voice.  And they laugh when they laugh too much.  Oh.  Yeah, I didn't even say anything, you moron.  Right.  Sorry about that.  I thought I was supposed to laugh there.  That was good.  That's exactly the way you did it.  No, I know.  I know.  Trust me.  I've heard enough of this.  I've never really had that, man.  The only time I thought I was going to have it was in Sacramento.  There was a guy where I was kind of like a dick to comics, but he turned out 
[00:12:00]  to be okay.  But I was so ready to attack him.  Yeah.  Yeah, on commercial, I would have just cursed and not even cared if it drew  people to the gig, but he was actually okay.  He turned out to be all right.  All right, why don't we listen to the tape here?  I would have.  Yeah, right at him.  Actually, not at him.  That's an assault.  How do you say his name?  Ares?  Ares Spears.  Ares Spears.  Do they have the tape of him bombing?  No.  So the tape picks up with the show just moving on to other business, I guess.  And Ares was on his way back into the studio and interrupts them.  He's a big dude from what I remember.  I was a big kid. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, he wasn't when he was young.  He was real small.  So here we go.  Oh, they have to do rock and roll still.  Yeah, 820.  Not good enough to do a talk show for four straight hours.  Got to fit in that rock and roll.  Come on.  What's wrong?  What's the show name?  Paul and Young Ron or something like that?  I don't know.  The big 105.9, Miami's classic rock.  Classic rock.  Classic rock that really rocks, everybody. 
[00:13:00]  The home of classic rock.  That's the new one.  Classic rock that really rocks.  Really rock.  Oh, there's other classic rock out there.  Do they really rock?  I'm not sure.  They really rock.  Let me take a look at my list here.  Here's Hart with Barracuda.  Those radio, and I've worked for all of them, so, you know.  But I always thought it was such a stupid thing.  The home of rock and roll.  And all the other rock stations in your area, they're not the home of rock and roll.  We're the home of rock and roll.  Ah!  Jesus Christ.  Oh, no.  Right on my fucking foot! 
[00:13:30]  That fucking thing fell again right on my fucking foot!  I can't tell you how many times last week I asked for this to be fixed, and it just fell  on my fucking bad foot.  I have a foot thing on my foot, and it just fell on it.  Don't laugh. 
[00:14:00]  I'm trying.  He has a foot thing on his foot.  He has a foot thing on his foot.  He's got one of those.  Why did that fall again?  He's got one of those.  Why did that fall again on my bad foot?  He's got one of those bad foot.  Dude, I got a boot on my foot because I have tendinitis, I have arthritis, and I have ligament  damage.  He's got old man foot.  And right on my goddamn foot.  That's the third time that fucking thing has fucking fallen.  Third time.  Holy shit, is that aggravating? 
[00:14:30]  Anthony and Jimmy are very serious, and me and Bob can't stop laughing.  It should not have fallen again.  Right on my foot.  Oh my god.  Holy shit.  I saw his face.  He just heard that freaking whack.  Scared the shit out of everybody.  It did scare me, man.  Don't look like a stress doll.  Somebody squeezed his gut. 
[00:15:00]  And then he just snapped.  I got a foot thing on my fucking foot.  Look at his foot.  I got an arm thing on my foot.  Look at this thing.  Look at this thing.  Look at this thing he has to wear.  It's a big foot thing.  I have enough problems.  He's going snowboarding after the show.  I'm trying to avoid surgery.  Yeah.  And I have stage four damage.  I have stage three damage.  I'm one inch from surgery.  And now you get stage four.  And I want to bite somebody's fucking face for that.  How did that happen? 
[00:15:30]  I want to know who fixed that.  Are you on the AZT for the stage?  Why was that not fixed?  No one fixed it.  It wasn't fixed.  Holy shit is that irritating.  It was fixed.  It wouldn't have fallen.  How big was the thing that fell, though?  It's this big.  It's a piece of it.  What is it?  It's solid.  And it falls.  It's probably eight inches off the ground.  Obi probably has fishing string over there.  All right.  Right now.  Quack my fucking foot.  I got a foot of a foot on my foot. 
[00:16:00]  Left-hand fucking foot.  I want that fixed.  Immediately.  Right in the middle of my goddamn fucking foot.  It's so.  I am so.  You're leaving Wednesday.  They'll never fix it.  Do you people think at HBO there's going to be stuff falling on his foot?  We're going to lose Jimmy because he's not going to want to come back.  Back to the likes of things falling on his feet.  Bingo Pants has a great idea now, though.  Come on.  Bingo Pants. 
[00:16:30]  How you doing?  Hey.  Can you guys put that thing that fell on Jimmy's foot on the auction, too?  Yeah, now it's a famous thing.  Because it's famous.  It's a famous thing.  It's a thing that fell on his foot.  What happens is if his foot goes to stage four, we can just put his foot up there.  Under the console, it's six inches off the ground.  There's like a little shelf.  And this is up on top of that.  So it's falling from a height.  Yeah.  Look at that.  It's not that high, but when the end of that smashes your foot, it hurts.  Look at that.  Holy shit.  And I asked for that last week to be fixed. 
[00:17:00]  There was screws coming out of it.  I understand.  Whatever, man.  I'm just going to start really being fucking nasty.  Yes.  When you ask for something to be fixed like that, because it's a physical hazard, why isn't  it done?  We have a lot of audio that proves that you asked for it to be fixed.  Holy fucking shit, is that annoying.  Oh, man.  But really funny.  Yeah, it's not like your karma didn't deserve that.  I hate him.  I hope he dies of cancer.  Fuck them.  You die.  Then you have something fall on your foot.  Exactly.  It's not right.  The universe came back and smashed your foot to me. 
[00:17:30]  Holy shit.  You okay?  Don is in New York today, so we'll get it fixed.  Oh, it's all fixed, Charles?  Why don't you just fucking throw it over there.  If they put it up, I'm going to throw it through the window.  What?  Feel how heavy that is.  Can somebody want to weigh that?  That is so heavy.  And what it's got are these little fasteners that aren't working, I guess.  Hey, Ryan from Florida feels for Jimmy.  Let's say hi to Ryan.  A lot of people feeling for you right now.  Go ahead, Ryan. 
[00:18:00]  Hey, man.  What the hell's up with that prima donna?  Prima donna.  Dude, I'm sitting here and something falls on my injured foot that I asked for to be fixed.  I didn't say it's painted the wrong color.  It fell on my foot.  Here goes the tear coming from all the blue-collar workers out there that fall off the ladders  and stuff every day and just get up and go back to work without saying a word.  Well, dude, first of all, then fuck them.  They're cowards.  I didn't walk off the job.  I'm still here.  But what do guys do when they fall off a ladder?  First of all, I didn't fall off a ladder.  If something fell on your foot, that's like, you know, getting a cut or something on your 
[00:18:30]  hand and, you know, I have to go to the emergency room or something for a little cut.  Yeah, really?  Is that what it's like?  Stupid.  It fell on my foot.  I asked for it to be fixed.  And let me tell you something.  That if I was a painter and I asked for something to be fixed and it fell, I'd complain.  Any painter or any other job would complain, blue-collar or not.  Nothing ever gets fixed, man.  Well, that's annoying.  You need someone to hold your hand, Jimmy?  No.  It's just annoying, dude.  You're in the middle of something and you just feel it smash your foot. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Foot!  And it's like you've asked for it to be fixed and it's not fixed and it's like one of a  million things he asked for is not done.  If we were working construction, sir, I don't think it would be a problem because it would  be something that happens on a daily basis.  When you come in to do a radio show every day, you don't expect to have heavy things falling  on you.  Yeah, but Jason from Michigan makes a good point.  I'm going to add to it.  If you didn't throw the power drill away, you could have freaking fixed that thing.  Could have fixed it yourself, Jimmy.  Crawled under there and drilled a few zip screws in.  Exactly.  But you had to throw the drill away because it wasn't good enough for you. 
[00:19:30]  He's a fancy man.  I smell foot diva.  Fancy feet.  Foot diva promo on the way.  The problem is this.  I've been having a serious problem with my foot.  I am worried about it and I'm trying to take care of it.  I'm fucking hobbling around on this cocksucker awful boot.  And I have to worry about sticking my fucking feet under the console and having shit fall.  I would love to get that weight and see how much that weighs.  That really, right on the bone of my foot.  I'd say about four pounds.  Not four pounds. 
[00:20:00]  How did your foot get so screwed up?  Because I had twisted, I have falling arches or whatever I have.  My feet are a mess, so I needed orthotics.  So when you have problems with your feet like that, you stand a certain way subconsciously.  You don't realize, my foot really hurts.  I'm really, really angry.  Oh, boy.  That's how I messed up my knee.  I'm sorry.  I was still talking about my foot.  Yeah.  Why do you, when you hurt something, though, you have to keep repeating the body part.  Like, my knee.  And he was like, my foot, my foot.  I have a foot thing on my foot. 
[00:20:30]  I didn't know what to say.  See how funny this can be when it's not you?  Oh, see?  See?  I hurt my foot, dude.  I didn't.  It's a foot thing on my foot.  I didn't know what it was called.  Is there a way that during commercials or something, you could pull him losing his mind when that  falls?  Because I got to hear it again.  He lost his mind right there.  Dude.  You know what it is?  My foot hurt last night because I had, the bandage wasn't as tight as it has been.  I was trying to get a looser bandage on it.  And today, now it's throbbing.  And I'm just, I'm so, I want to kick something. 
[00:21:00]  Not with this foot thing.  What would they do if they had to do surgery, like you said, what would they be doing to  your foot?  They would go, I don't know.  I have, I know on the left side of my right foot, I have, it's a bone problem.  And on the right side, it's a nerve.  I was getting like, I was getting like numbness in my leg for months when I would sit.  It was like a sciatic problem.  This genius doctor I go to, she helped, so far I have none of that leg numbness anymore.  She's fixing me.  Yeah.  She's fixing me. 
[00:21:30]  It's slow.  And she puts a medicated bandage on it.  But I got tendinitis, I got a little arthritis.  I got so fucked up because I twisted it twice.  Never, and now you guys know who I was.  I was hobbling along since like May.  Bad little paw.  I finally got it fixed.  And it's like a slow process, but I can't be in a cast.  I gotta, I gotta, you know, whatever.  I gotta be out there doing.  You got showbiz to do.  You can't have stuff falling on your foot either.  No.  Oh, dude.  That's what annoys me is shit happens.  But when you say, look, I have a problem with my thing here.  I'm injured.  Can you not have that thing underneath the desk falling on it? 
[00:22:00]  Say your foot.  For the third, I know, you're right.  Say your foot, you jicken.  Don't say my thing.  We're gonna go.  I'm not a jicken, stupid.  We're gonna find the audio.  Halloween.  But I think I, I think I caused that.  Because someone said something really funny.  And I either hit this really hard or kicked something under my thing.  And I think that was all it took to, because this thing was barely, you know, barely hanging  on.  Well, dude, if you caused it by doing this, that's not sturdy worksmanship.  No.  Worksmanship.  I said it. 
[00:22:30]  Worksmanship.  Worksmanship.  I really, I really have never done a real man's work in my life.  No.  I want to get some elbow grime.  No, no, no.  And you were talking about a painter.  Well, he said painter.  The guy on the fall race, painter.  That's why I said that.  All right.  Painter, what the fuck, what does painter do?  We're gonna, we're gonna find the audio.  We're gonna find it after break.  You want to do our, what do you want to do, Derek?  I, I can't edit it out until we break in the computer.  All right, yeah, yeah.  I just want to hear it, because he yelled so loud.  I didn't mean to blow on anybody's ears.  Oh, I just got to hear it.  Well, why don't we get back to the big 105.9. 
[00:23:00]  Right, the big 105.9.  Miami's classic rock station.  That's where you're at, right?  All right, uh, we don't have to set this up anymore, do we?  Aries Spears.  Aries Spears from Mad TV, went on this show.  Thing fell on his foot, he got pissed.  What happened?  Didn't have a good appearance, and the guys, after he left the studio, called him out on  it, and Aries heard that and ran back in the studio and started, uh, turned the car around,  he said.  A nice verbal fight.  So, dude, this is actually, this is actually him coming back into this, this is actually 
[00:23:30]  him coming back into the studio.  Yeah, here we go.  So, the show's moving on to other business, uh, uh, that's much more important, like playing  heart records.  Yeah.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Well, you say, hold on, hold on, we're on the air now.  Yeah, let's be on the air.  All right, you're back, you're back.  Okay.  Oh, this is good.  Why does every, uh, DJ on commercial radio sound exactly the same?  Hey, we're back on the air now.  I gotta put on my radio guy voice. 
[00:24:00]  We gotta get a montage of all these guys that are one market sensations, and you will hear  the same thing.  They have the same exact voice.  Don't they teach that to them, though?  Like, they have to enunciate and say words.  There was a time when you got into radio, you had to have a really good voice.  And then, uh, you know, somewhere along the line, you just, you just went on the air  as yourself, and the people that did that became really successful.  But these other guys can't see that, so they have to...  Hey!  They have to stay with the tried and true, which is that fake radio voice, everybody!  It's so typical. 
[00:24:30]  Like, they...  It's not even a different radio voice.  It's all the same radio voice they put on.  It's really...  They all sound alike.  Yeah, but it's kind of fun to do.  It is fun when you're doing it yourself, just tagging out of here, talking into the  microphone.  Hey, how you doing?  This is Robert Kelly on RKL Live.  How you doing, Bob?  Good to hear you.  Good to have you back on the program.  My friend Jimmy just, uh, just, uh, fucked up his foot on his foot.  Something on his foot.  He got something on his foot on his foot.  Yeah, a foot-foot.  I wonder if he has a foot fetish. 
[00:25:00]  Hysterical!  9.35.  Hi, I'm a woman.  Now, guys, don't make fun.  Fuck you, cunt.  Anyway.  Just for once, I wish one of those guys would say that.  No.  To the hole.  You'll never hear honesty.  To the hole.  Every one of these one-market sensations has to have a hole with them.  You'll never hear honesty like that on those shows.  Oh, we fought.  We fought for years, Anthony and I. 
[00:25:30]  They wanted a hole on our program.  Oh.  Just to balance it out, you know.  Ugh.  Ugh.  We said no to the hole.  Oh, guys.  Oh, well, Opie, now maybe we shouldn't go down that road.  Don't go down that road, yeah.  You fucking cunt.  Ugh.  You shocked me on that one.  I'm a shock choc.  We're shocking.  Shock chocs.  Shock chocs.  Shock chocs.  All right.  Here we go.  So, uh, I gotta go back.  Because you gotta hear the fake voices.  Why?  Oh, we'll get to you.  We'll get to you. 
[00:26:00]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We got six listeners.  Hold on.  We're on the air now.  Yeah.  Let's keep on the air.  All right.  You're back.  You're back.  Okay.  Oh, this is good.  Yeah.  Now, you know, radio and TV is all about ratings.  Yeah.  Let's go ahead and get some ratings for you now.  You can leave if you want, or you can stay.  You verbally thrashed me when I left.  Now, you verbally thrashed us in the hallway on the way out.  I didn't thrash you in the hallway.  Yeah, you did.  The guy came in and told us what you said.  Look, dog, I've been doing stand-up for 15 years.  I've been doing thousands of radio stations.  All right.  So, what happened here? 
[00:26:30]  Okay.  So, I know the deal.  You didn't do diddly on our show.  Okay.  You just came in and said...  Oh, diddly.  Whoa.  Those are fighting words.  Diddly.  Diddly.  If you don't do diddly, you are in deep trouble with other radio personalities.  Wow.  Diddly.  Uh-oh.  He did not go there.  He did not go there.  He did, O.B.  You've got to give your share of diddly on our show.  How do you respond to diddly?  You have to get up and just go.  Uh-oh.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  By the way, why did we graduate to the taking the pants down to fart thing? 
[00:27:00]  Because people have complained there's not enough hot in the show.  Jimmy.  Jimmy pulls his plump little cheeks out.  He did.  He pulled his little baby ass out.  Shoves the mic right in the crack.  You've got splatter all over your ass now.  You have to.  But you know what the difference is, though?  As awful as it is, every one of you, you're drawn to those plump little delicious, those  two little soft, fleshy lemons.  I'm just hoping a poopy pops out.  Dude, if that would happen.  Believe me, if I shot a log onto the mic.  That was the closest you got to having a little poopy pop out. 
[00:27:30]  It actually was.  A little nugget fall out of the air.  A little rumbly, yeah.  It's not going to be a nugget, dude.  It's going to be something that hits the mic, lands on the floor, and in my socks.  It hits your foot, and you go, my foot.  My foot.  I got shit on my foot foot.  I thought it was going to be soft serve ice cream.  A little Carvel.  Swirly swirls.  Fudgy the dick joke artist.  All right, let's get back to Paul and Young Ron, everybody.  Right?  Paul and Young Ron, he didn't do diddly. 
[00:28:00]  Diddly?  On their show.  The deal.  You didn't do diddly on our show.  I don't like the way you presented it.  What are you talking about?  You're having a conversation.  Here's my point to you, and this is why I turned the car around and came back.  I'm glad you came back.  You were thrashing me, and all the listeners heard it.  You were thrashing me, and I'd get the freak out of your studio and go back over there  to the hippity hop rap station where they have six listeners.  Can I talk?  I'm not done.  I think I deserve the right to talk.  You thrashed me when I left.  And I'll respond.  Say everything you said on the radio to my face.  Just let him respond.  Hold on a second.  Say it to my face. 
[00:28:30]  I'm going to say it to your face, and I'm going to respond to why I said that about the  hip hop.  You walked out in the hallway and told this kid that, man, I went to the hip hop station,  and we got along fine.  I did all my material.  That pissed me off, because you didn't do any material on this show.  Because the way that it was presented to me here.  How was it presented to you?  Let me tell you something.  When you do shows, and you're a comedian, and you do impressions, no one likes for you  to just go, hey, do this.  Do that.  I didn't know one did.  Bravo.  There you go.  I like this Aries guy.  Absolutely.  Bravo.  That is so fucking true as far as regular radio goes. 
[00:29:00]  Why don't you do that impression you do?  Do some Shaq.  Can we get audio of that?  Hey, I hear you do Shaq.  Let me hear you do a little Shaq.  Bravo for calling him out, because that's what commercial radio does all the time.  What's that, Jimmy?  I was going to say, if we get audio of him, is there any way we can get audio of him actually  on that show?  I'd love to hear how that went.  Yeah, what happened beforehand.  See, and it's not easy.  We struggle with this all the time.  You can guess in.  You want to make him feel comfortable, and you want to make him feel part of the environment. 
[00:29:30]  You don't want to ever just go, hey, Bob, and make him do a bit.  Especially not his.  Yeah, true.  Marshmally.  But no, the difference is that-  I was going to go with this, and then name one of your bits, but I didn't know any, because  then that would have worked better.  We could take care of that right now.  There's a CD.  Thank you, sir.  Because I was going to try to set you up for one of my bits to do.  Yeah, go ahead.  Hey, Bob, uh, naps.  I don't even know that joke.  What the fuck?  Did you read that off my CD?  Yeah, it's track 12. 
[00:30:00]  I don't remember the bit, but I bet it goes like this.  Dude, I love taking fucking naps.  Fucking naps rule.  And if it was on your CD, it'd be like, I fucking hate naps.  First of all, that wouldn't be on my CD.  That was very hurtful, Bob.  It certainly was.  Dude, I love naps!  All right, let me try it again.  I am a negative little douche. 
[00:30:30]  Guys, guys in studio, we got a very funny guy, Bob Kelly.  Hey, Bob Kelly's with us.  Bob, I hear you just got back from California.  Yeah, I was in California out there doing some stuff, you know, some L.A. stuff.  Do you like California, Bob?  Actually, I don't.  I hate California, you know.  I'm Irish, and, you know, I look Spanish. 
[00:31:00]  Everybody just walks up to me out there.  I'm Irish, and I'm Irish.
