<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with excited speculation about their upcoming appearance on *The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon*, alongside Betty White.  They compared White's rumored wild side to Cloris Leachman, and the conversation segued into a discussion of the sitcom *Rhoda* and Nancy Cartwright's surprising career path, including her role as Bart Simpson and an appearance in *The Twilight Zone* movie.  A significant portion of the show focused on Jimmy Fallon’s calorie counting struggles and the website "thisiswhyyourfat.com," showcasing pictures of incredibly high-calorie meals.  The hosts, Travis, and a caller discussed various calorically dense foods like buffalo wings, with "thisiswhyyourfat.com" becoming a recurring theme.

Anthony then recounted a graphic dream about an old woman’s face disintegrating in his hands, detailing his dream control and penchant for "raping and pillaging" within his dreams. This led to a discussion about the smell of other people's bodily fluids, fueled by a caller's story about her husband's intensely foul-smelling bowel movements. A dream interpreter called in, offering a psychological interpretation of Anthony's dream. The hosts also played a game based on a bizarre PETA campaign protesting fish-throwing at Pike Place Market, followed by listener calls describing unusual dreams and pranks, including one involving feces in a refrigerator.  The discussion touched on video game graphics and seal clubbing depictions, before briefly mentioning upcoming guests Jimmy Fallon and David Tell and playing a clip of a seemingly intoxicated Danny DeVito on local news.

The show's focus returned to their *Tonight Show* appearance, recalling previous awkward experiences as audience members, including a failed attempt at a pom-pom routine. A lengthy phone conversation with Jimmy Fallon ensued, filled with banter and jokes about the upcoming show, including a planned beer pong match with Betty White and pushing television boundaries.  The conversation touched on Fallon's Twitter use, talk show hosting challenges, and the deaths of Danny Gans and David Carradine, sparking a graphic discussion of Carradine's death and reported sexual practices. Dave Attell, promoting his shows at Caroline's Comedy Club, was a guest in the studio, offering contrasting views on social media compared to the hosts.  A running gag throughout this segment involved guessing the number of actresses who played Annie in various stage productions.

This "Annie" trivia continued into the next segment, interspersed with jokes by David Letterman about Sarah Palin, a discussion about Alaskan gangs, and a surprisingly morbid tangent about the number of "Annies" in pornography.  A news story about a shooting at a Holocaust Museum prompted insensitive comments from the hosts regarding the shooter.  David Tell, a stand-up comedian, called in to discuss his performances, especially in Salt Lake City for Mormon audiences.  This was followed by commentary on a YouTube video of a man electrocuted on a train in India.  A "Hollywood 411 with Club Soda Canning" segment featured crude jokes about celebrities, including Kim Kardashian and Adam Lambert, leading to a discussion about the appropriateness and potential consequences of offensive humor, specifically homophobic slurs.

The final segment centered on the show's edgy content and potential repercussions, referencing a past suspension due to a homeless guest's comments about sex with Laura Bush, Condoleezza Rice, and the Queen of England. They discussed a bit called "Shit Dick," the lack of pre-air vetting, and potential backlash.  The conversation involved a caller, Larry, Steve Carlesi (the subject of "Shit Dick"), and a gay caller, Jason, who enjoyed the bit.  Gifts from a female guest, Caitlin, were mentioned, along with discussions about perceived double standards between the show and other comedians like Sacha Baron Cohen. The show concluded with more banter and preparations for their appearance on *The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon*.  The entire broadcast used frequent profanity and discussed sexually explicit topics.  A recurring theme throughout was the discussion of a horrific smell in the studio bathroom, culminating in Opie's description of a disturbing nightmare.  The show also included a discussion about the death of the world's oldest person and the inevitability of death, with a focus on guessing which four meals E-Rock had chosen from "thisiswhyyourfat.com," culminating in a deep-fried lard ball covered in sugar that the hosts intended to consume on-air.  The show also touched on deceptive marketing of "light" cigarettes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  The jokes have begun.  Good morning, welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hello everybody!  It's Jimmy Fallon Day.  Is that it? All day?  Yeah, let's call it Jimmy Fallon Day.  Yeah!  I'm actually very excited.  I know, it's going to be fun.  We're taping Jimmy Fallon, I don't know what, in the afternoon?  Yeah, they do that tape in the afternoon thing, and then you get to hang out. 
[00:00:30]  For hours, before you watch it.  And then you wonder, I wonder if it looked good, or sounded good, or anything like that.  It's going to be fine.  We had fun talking to the Jimmy Fallon people yesterday afternoon.  Yes, we talked to their peeps.  And we're going to be on the show with Betty White.  Betty White!  Let's try to make out with Betty White.  She'd probably do it. She's a goer, that Betty White.  Is she really?  Yeah, she's a pretty wild, older woman.  Who's wilder, her or Kors Leachman? 
[00:01:00]  Well, I think they're both from the same school of thought, you know?  And the same show.  Yeah, Mary Tyler Moore.  They're on that thing.  And then occasionally, you know, a guest spot on Rhoda.  Rhoda sucked.  Rhoda.  Let's not date ourselves.  I'm Rhoda Morgenstern!  All right, you're Jewish, we get it.  She had a big J on her forehead, we know.  With her schmata.  With the crazy 70s outfits.  Yeah.  Because she had headbands and stuff. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And then her sister, Rhoda's sister, the fat one.  Remember her?  Oh, right.  And I think she went on to, isn't that, what's her name?  That's Marge Simpson.  That's Marge Simpson's voice.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, that was Rhoda's sister on...  What's her name?  On Rhoda.  Marge Simpson.  Marge Simpson.  Oh, voice.  Yeah.  Girl.  Girl.  Nancy Cartwright.  What?  No, that's not Nancy Cartwright.  Is that Nancy Cartwright?  No, that's Bart!  Oh, yeah, yeah.  My bad.  Don't make a mistake in this room.  Just Nancy's trying to offer some, isn't that Nancy? 
[00:02:00]  You piece of shit.  Julie Kavner?  Ah, that sounds like her.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's go with that.  See, I got confused.  That's the one.  Why is a chick doing the voice of Bart Simpson?  I never understood that.  The first time we met Nancy Cartwright out there in L.A.,  I'm like, you're Bart Simpson?  I mean, this was before most people knew that the voice of Bart Simpson was done by a woman.  Yeah.  It confused everybody.  What?  You're Bart Simpson?  By the way, Nancy Cartwright also was in the Twilight Zone movie as the sister of Anthony. 
[00:02:30]  Okay, Anthony.  Whatever you need, Anthony.  She was the one that was running through the cartoon character scene and then eaten.  That's a nice little factoid.  A little factoid for you.  And then she was in some sitcom that didn't go anywhere.  Pretty sure that was her.  That I forgot the name of, but...  Looks different.  Whatever.  Did you like the new website?  The new website.  I turned you guys on to...  Because Jimmy came in and... 
[00:03:00]  What did you say, Jimmy?  You've given up on the calorie counting already?  No, I don't know how much...  I ate grilled chicken a couple times yesterday.  I don't know how many big the portions were.  I ordered like a piece of grilled chicken with some teriyaki and then I had like a little asparagus.  Oh, the teriyaki's bad.  No, it's not that bad.  I mean, a little bit like that, I don't mind.  A little teriyaki sauce.  If I'm eating grilled chicken...  Yeah, but the calorie counter might mind.  Well, the calorie counter has to simmer down.  The calorie counter...  Might mind.  They don't say, you know, a nice piece from the market, grilled chicken.  I don't know how much I ate. 
[00:03:30]  And then last night, I ate grilled chicken for dinner, but then I had a little bit of like  very low-fat avocado dip.  How much of a portion?  How many portions did you have?  Yeah.  How many portions?  I knew they...  Strawberries.  Yeah, they were calling me old yellow shirt.  Old yellow face.  Of course.  Old yellow gums.  I don't know, but I'm trying to figure out how much grilled chicken I had.  I had a huge piece last night.  I think... 
[00:04:00]  The Foreman Grill.  You don't have it?  I actually got a piece of chicken at the market yesterday, and it was under a pound, so...  The market?  Where are you, Bangladesh?  Yeah, it was at the market.  It was at the marketplace.  Suicide bombing as I was buying chicken.  I think it was like three-quarters of a pound, and that was a big piece of chicken,  and I didn't eat the whole thing.  I might...  It might be a...  I think I had like a half-pound piece last night, but...  That sounds about right, Jimmy.  Really?  If it wasn't like huge, maybe a little more than that.  Slightly.  I have to redo my... 
[00:04:30]  Stop my calorie count today.  Oh, exhausting.  Yeah, it does seem like you're exhausting yourself.  Honey, I'm doing the best I can.  You know what?  Yeah.  So then we went to this website.  It's called thisiswhyyourfat.com.  Yeah.  And this website's just getting started, but basically it's a picture of all these delicious  things that people eat, and this is why you're fat.  What is that, Danny?  Can you read off some of the deliciousness?  That looks horrific.  It's just people take pictures of their plates, and they're full of just high-calorie, disgusting, 
[00:05:00]  cheesy messes.  Oh, could you call it goodness?  Goodness, yes.  In the end, it's goodness.  This one's good for you, because it's chicken.  That was my dad's philosophy, because he had horrible heart problems.  Horrible.  And we would try to watch his diet, and we'd go, all right, what did you eat?  Buffalo chicken wings?  I'm like, that's probably the worst thing you could eat if you have horrible heart problems.  He goes, what?  It's chicken.  It's all butter, and like, you haven't seen him make those things? 
[00:05:30]  You don't want to know what they do.  They say chicken skin, especially fried, is the worst thing you could eat on this planet,  basically.  And, of course, goodness.  Oh, it's just filled with goodness.  If you get a nice piece of nicely cooked, tender chicken, but the outside, the skin has  been crispy a little bit, and you get that on the same fork, fucking bad.  And then you dip it in more hot sauce that's on the bottom of the plate, then you put in  the blue cheese.  Shots of butter. 
[00:06:00]  How many calories in a dozen buffalo chicken wings, Dan?  King of the internet.  Well, I will find that for you.  That's what you're talking about.  King of the internet.  King of the internet.  Yep.  That's what we should do to see if anyone could find stuff faster than Danny can.  I don't think this is a person alive.  Probably a medium coffee apres.  I think Travis just chimed in saying he rules.  Oh, Travis, come on.  Shut up, you girl.  Hey, Travis, did you like the new website?  This is why you're fat.com.  I love the new website.  This is why you're gay.com. 
[00:06:30]  No, that's not it.  I would never check it out.  It's just a photo of cocks.  This is awesome.  And thin-bearded gentlemen.  Yeah.  If you find yourself salivating looking at these, and you look down at your keyboard and there's drool on it, you're like, oh, no.  I'm a fag.  What dish did you like the best when you were looking at the website today there, Travis?  I just found the Patty La Burger, which is a triple bacon cheeseburger with deep-fried patties as buns.  Oh, no.  A bunch of dried-up 50-year-old vaginas as a burger.  So they deep-fry more burgers to just make the buns out of them. 
[00:07:00]  It looks delicious.  I can eat everything on this website.  Of course you can.  You weigh 80 pounds.  You're the only person that is looking at that website and not feeling guilty.  Got a metabolism like a hummingbird.  I think my cholesterol is probably really bad.  Yeah.  Sure.  What you can't do is fight off a common cold or live to be past 40, hopefully.  A little weak heart.  People are looking at the website at home.  They're just writing, sweet Jesus. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It's a horrific sight.  860 calories?  I mean, I'm sure it's depending on what kind of oil and what kind of sauce.  Those tiny little fucking wings.  I think that's on the...  Back to the hummingbird bit again for those wings.  I think that's on the low side.  I'm sure you...  But then if you're having wings, you're also having a few beers, and then you're...  And you're dipping it in that frigging dressing there and stuff.  All that stuff.  Now, I want to know what that big, cheesy plate is there.  It's chicken.  It's chicken and what? 
[00:08:00]  Topped with pepperoni, ham, and garlic butter on top of french fries covered in cheese.  Sounds great.  Sounds really good for you.  That's the Teesside Meat Feast.  Nothing ever meat feast thing.  Whenever they put them on at a chain restaurant or something, it's never good.  No.  And for the people that are confused and they think chicken wings are healthy because it's  chicken, look up the inventor of the chicken wing and see what happened to him.  Oh, boy.  If I got my factoids right, he died of a massive coronary. 
[00:08:30]  I wouldn't doubt it.  Barely making 50 years old.  Oh.  I hope so, because that would suck if he lived to be 98 and he was really healthy and he  was hip.  Eat most chicken wings?  Yeah.  That would confuse everyone.  Just get by a truck.  So what do you need counted now, Jimmy?  I like the new bit, the calorie counting Jim Norton bit.  I just, um, I'm nothing, I just realized that a medium Starbucks coffee, regular coffee  with skim milk, is 8% of my daily calories. 
[00:09:00]  Doesn't make sense.  8%.  Throw the, I'm only curious, I don't care about the calorie count.  MJ is writing me now, screaming.  I am just curious as to the things I'm eating that are probably bad that I'm not sure of.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Slow down.  So she's screaming, oh my God, look who I'm with.  Slow down.  Something's wrong.  He likes boys.  A medium coffee can't be 8% of your calories for the day.  That's impossible.  Probably not.  How much sugar you got in there?  None.  I don't use sugar with my coffee.  So it's just coffee and skim milk?  That's impossible.  Well, it's 140 calories.  Can't be. 
[00:09:30]  It can't be.  Coffee and skim milk?  That's impossible.  They're factoring in all kinds of things that people put in there.  They're probably assuming that people are putting cream in there and maybe a couple things  of sugar, because that's impossible.  Cream goes in.  It's just drinking.  I love the people that go to Starbucks, and because it seems like it's a coffee shop, you  can order anything on the menu, and it's got to be like low in calories.  It's just coffee.  Some of those drinks are, I think, over 1,000 calories.  Yeah, just for one drink. 
[00:10:00]  1,000 calories.  That's unbelievable.  It goes pretty much half your day.  Wait, just not 11 grams of sugar in just a medium coffee, right?  Why would there be 11 grams?  You're putting that in there.  I didn't put it in there.  That's what I'm saying.  I didn't put it in there.  Why does it say sugars?  Coffee doesn't come with sugar.  You put the sugar in it.  I didn't put any sugar.  All right.  All right, Jimmy.  All right.  We're all on edge.  We're all on edge.  We're with you, Jim.  We're with you.  Because you know what?  Anthony referenced that Twilight Zone movie, that's how we are with Jimmy right now. 
[00:10:30]  It's okay, Jimmy.  It's okay, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  You're Jimmy.  You're a good boy.  If you say no, 140 calories, okay.  You count those calories, Jimmy.  You're a good boy.  Because, you know, it'll just explode.  It'll explode.  We'll all be sent to the cornfield.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, Anthony.  You're a good boy.  What do you want for dinner, Anthony?  Do you have hamburgers with peanut butter and potato chips on them?  It's good.  Yeah, whatever you want.  They're like, sure, it's good, Anthony. 
[00:11:00]  We love you, Anthony.  You're a good boy.  You know we should be doing that bit for somebody else, but...  Oh, I know.  Around this place.  You're a good boy, Howie.  That's how everybody is around here.  That's how they treat them.  You're a good boy.  Sure, whatever you want.  You want to work two days a week?  Okay.  I'll send you the cornfield. 
[00:11:30]  That's more like it.  The first answer today?  Herman's head.  Oh, God.  New bit.  We just, like, answer the stuff as we go along.  Yeah, I remember that.  Remember I said, what's her name?  I forgot her name.  Nancy Cartwright?  Yeah.  Some sitcom?  And I went, ah, whatever.  Look at that.  The magic screen gave me the answer.  Instead of instant feedback, this is now called the magic screen.  Was that Nancy Cartwright that was on Herman's head?  Hell yeah.  Is that Nancy Cartwright?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah?  Absolutely. 
[00:12:00]  I think it was another one from The Simpsons.  Oh, no.  Yeah, it was the one that does Lisa.  It's Lisa.  The one that does Lisa.  The one that does Lisa.  Oh, no.  Yes, and she was in Maximum Overdrive.  God damn it, you're right.  She was the bride in Maximum Overdrive, the Trucks movie, Stephen King, that horrible movie.  Hey, bub.  It was that one.  Oh, you're right.  I'd give myself a boo, but for some reason, E-Roc felt like not setting up the instant replay today.  Why would you set it up?  Yardley Smith. 
[00:12:30]  Yardley Smith is the answer.  Okay.  I knew it was a Simpson character in a sitcom.  Yeah.  Homer doesn't show up in anything, does he?  He's just Homer.  Why would he?  He's got it made.  The other ones have been in all kinds of little things here and there.  Who makes the most money on that show?  That used to be a big controversy for a while.  They don't make all the same?  Well, I mean, you know.  I think Bart and Homer were neck and neck as far as getting paid the most.  Homer probably makes a lot more.  Is that show still on The Simpsons? 
[00:13:00]  Sure.  Yeah.  It's the 20th year.  Original episodes, too?  Yeah.  I tapped out a while ago.  A lot of people have.  Yeah.  A while ago.  Years ago, I do believe.  The writing has kind of evolved over the years.  Well, it's still very popular.  People are still watching The Simpsons.  Apparently.  I'm more a family guy, South Park guy.  Right?  South Park, I go in waves.  Yeah.  I have my ebbs and flows with South Park sometimes.  But when South Park is on.  Oh, yeah.  That's what it is.  You know?  You just...  I don't watch them first runs. 
[00:13:30]  Sometimes I'll just watch them reruns and go, oh, my God.  But this is hysterical again.  And then start watching it again.  Yeah.  I just want the kids to grow up a little bit.  They've been the same age for like 10 years.  I don't like when they age cartoon kids.  I love when they age the cartoon kids.  The only one that they age well was when Fred was dreaming.  Fred Flintstone.  And Pebbles grew up and got married in the little church.  That was creepy.  Yeah.  It was a creepy one.  That was like a real creepy one.  Didn't it snow and stuff?  Yeah, yeah.  Wasn't it snowing and they just made a... 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, and he was like, Pebbles.  It was all weird.  And he looked in there and the woman turned around.  It wasn't Pebbles.  Right.  And the aisle in the church started getting real long.  It was like some kind of Max Payne fucking nightmare that Fred was having.  It was very dark, I remember.  Yeah.  As a kid, you're like, what?  That was kind of a creepy Flintstones episode.  And wasn't he crying because she was marrying one of the boondocks?  No.  I don't think that happened.  Oh, Dan Castellan...  How do you say his name? 
[00:14:30]  Castellaneta or Nada, whatever.  Homer.  Homer was on Stargate.  What?  He guessed it on Stargate.  Oh, a guest spot on Stargate.  Well, that's just because he was one of the simps.  You didn't get into Stargate, right?  No.  The movie wasn't bad.  But the TV show could not get into MacGyver doing Stargate.  I never saw it.  I think E-Rock's a fan of Stargate, right?  Of course he is.  Big time.  Where the fuck is E-Rock?  I want buttons.  I want buttons over here. 
[00:15:00]  I have somebody working on it.  That's him.  Is E-Rock in today?  Yeah.  Oh.  Of course.  Yeah, he's done a lot of stuff.  Don't you see your water getting that little ripple in it like when the T-Rex walked around  in Jurassic Park?  I love the guys that just walked down the hall.  Here he comes.  No pressure on you.  You're not on the air.  Take your time.  Yeah.  Holy crap.  This is a pressure cooker every day.  Why are you taking your time, E-Rock?  What's up?  Fight back, E-Rock. 
[00:15:30]  You're too busy on the new website?  Yes.  You've seen how many of those meals you've eaten?  I found four already on there that I like.  Really?  Yeah.  Which four?  There's a lot of disgusting stuff on there.  Everything looks like puke in a plate.  Yeah.  Let's go back to the website.  Don't tell us.  Want to guess which four meals E-Rock has eaten off that site?  Page one, page two, page three, and page four.  I'm trying to say the first four.  He only looked at four.  Then we called him.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go down the new website and figure out which four meals E-Rock has eaten on. 
[00:16:00]  ThisIsWhyYou'reFat.com.  Read them off, Dan, and we'll decide.  Well, first up, we got chocolate truffle pie.  Hell no.  No.  Chocolate truffle pie.  What is that?  It's something called Porky's Revenge, which is a pork schnitzel with ground pork crackle  fried and butter...  What? 
[00:16:30]  Crackle fried and butter topped with melted Colby cheese and bacon bits.  No.  Holy shit.  Would you eat that?  I would eat all these things.  They sound good.  Yeah.  Next up is Kentucky Nachos, which is potato chips covered in barbecued pulled pork, blue  cheese, coleslaw, cheddar cheese, and sautéed onions and peppers.  It sounds delicious.  Uh-uh.  I bet E-Rock likes this.  Heart attack fries.  Yeah, yeah.  I got to...  I'm looking at his pants, and whenever I see a tent, I'm going to know what should  be eating one.  Yeah, whenever he gets a little plump.  That's it.  Cheese-covered fries with grilled onions, bacon, and beef, and that's something that I could 
[00:17:00]  definitely see E-Rock eating.  I would say...  I could see him drinking that.  They're shaking.  I'm going to say no, because it doesn't sound...  E-Rock, didn't you have that out of a martini glass somewhere?  Yeah.  No, that was filet mignon, mashed potatoes, gravy, and chives.  In a martini glass to make it classy.  Don't you have a picture of that?  Put it up on the site, because it's one of those sites where you can submit pictures.  Okay.  A meat martini.  It's fun.  My list kind of starts on page three, so... 
[00:17:30]  Oh, page three.  Okay.  Well, then go forward.  Wow, he went deep into the website.  He really did.  I did one page and said, all right, that was fun for two minutes, and I moved on to something  else.  But he probably ate things close to things on the first two pages, but he's discounting  them for some real weird technical issues.  I didn't have a yellow plate.  Sure.  What is that on a stick?  A deep fried cheeseburger on a stick.  I thought about that one.  It's a deep fried cheeseburger on a stick.  Why'd you think about that one?  Because it kind of looks delicious, but I don't know if I'd have a cheeseburger deep 
[00:18:00]  fried.  I'm on the fence with that.  Oh, God damn.  What is that?  Someone's cock?  Well, yeah.  It's called the humdinger.  It's a corn roll, tomali, and a hot dog bun covered with chili and topped with onions,  peppers, and cheese.  No.  Oh, here we go.  I see some kind of a hammy thing or bacon-y looking.  Ham or any kind of cheesy thing.  What's it filled with?  That's bacon cream cheese rolls?  No.  Ugh.  That's our big meat feast?  Yeah.  I would say, yeah, Iraq would like that. 
[00:18:30]  No.  It's not on his list, but I know he'd like it.  What are those things?  Fucking hen eggs?  Those are deep fried lard balls covered in sugar?  Shut up.  No way.  Who the fuck's eating that?  Who would eat that?  Is there anyone out there that has eaten that?  What is it?  A deep fried lard?  Mongoloids eat that.  Lard balls.  Anyone with a friggin' brain cell would look at that and go, there's no way I should  eat that.  Lard balls?  They look like a salt lake, like a deer.  Dopes.  What's the next one?  Next up is donut fries, which is donut french fries with raspberry jelly and Bavarian cream 
[00:19:00]  dipping sauce.  That looks fucking delicious.  Get me some donut fries.  That's like, they're fried.  They look like fries, but they're just, they're donut strips.  And then you dip them in raspberry and Bavarian cream?  Dude, that looks great.  I would eat them until I was on my back, just throwing up into my own mouth and on my neck.  That's like Tub Girl, only out of your mouth.  Hold it for one second.  More info on Homer?  Yeah. 
[00:19:30]  Entourage?  Oh, okay.  Don't worry.  And a regular, according to Bill in Texas.  Oh, Bill.  On Rhoda.  The show you referenced this morning.  Two Simpsons characters on Rhoda?  I don't know.  Well, who was he in Rhoda?  I'm not buying that.  We'll have to look that up.  Oh, we're going to look it up right now.  I like this.  Why don't you start talking about Maritala Moore?  Is it because of who you're on with tonight?  Betty White.  Oh, Betty, okay.  Betty White.  We're going to make out with Betty White.  Make out?  You've got to make out. 
[00:20:00]  You can't just kiss her on the corpse lips.  You've got to go all in.  I love Betty White.  I'm popping a feel.  Oof.  Grab one.  See what Alan Ludden got.  Why would you say that about the nice lady?  I know.  You know what?  She's a wild woman.  You see her as herself?  She's crazy.  Is she?  Yeah, I love it.  Those crazy old women.  I don't think he was on that as a regular.  I think the guy's mistaking the guy that played Rhoda's boyfriend. 
[00:20:30]  We're not going to let him off the hook.  Bill.  Hello, Bill.  We don't see Homer as a regular on Rhoda.  He was a semi-regular.  What was he?  He was just a neighbor or a boyfriend along that line, but he wasn't there full time.  He wasn't the boyfriend.  That was another guy.  He's not credited on IMDb.  Not credited.  Maybe he doesn't want that credit on IMDb.  Why don't you look up Homer's IMDb and then see what he...  Because he might have been on a show that this guy is like Phyllis.  He might have been on Phyllis or something else. 
[00:21:00]  Or Maud.  There were a lot of spin-offs.  You don't remember him on Rhoda.  You don't remember him on Rhoda.  He didn't start even...  He wasn't even in the business until it looks like 86.  Exactly.  He wasn't even born then, sir.  Yeah.  You're out of your bird.  He was his evil twin brother then.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Say liar, liar.  Let's go to some dude in Denver.  Some dude in Denver.  It's John in Denver.  Hey, John.  How are you, buddy?  Hey, Dan.  I love you.  Love the show.  I've got an Aunt Viola that lived in East Texas.  Died when she was 96 years old. 
[00:21:30]  And when she was younger, she would eat lard sandwiches on white bread with mayonnaise and cheese.  Lard sandwiches?  Lard sandwiches.  Yeah, she would...  You know, she could buy the slice lard.  Shoot the sandwich.  I knew where you were going.  I'm not...  It's not a joke.  We know.  No, we don't.  Okay, we're not laughing at you.  God rest your Aunt Viola's soul.  Yeah.  What did she die of?  Not a joke.  It's not a joke.  She died when she was 96 of old age.  She was picking berries at 98 degrees. 
[00:22:00]  You know what?  But if she put down the lard sandwich, she might have made 102 or 103.  She had an orange peel in her mouth, chasing a little kid around.  She was picking berries, and then Henry Fonda fucked her in the ass against a tree because  he was lost.  Because he was picking berries.  I thought I was fucking a loom.  She was yelling, rape, Norman.  Good evening.  See you later.  Good evening.  She died picking berries.  Berries. 
[00:22:30]  I love that one.  Old hag.  Yeah.  Fucking fingers all stained with berries.  She'd been picking to know and eat.  There were those berries off the apartment shrubs.  Those little red berries that you throw at your friends who are retarded.  Those are, I think, poisonous.  They're terrible.  She probably ate them.  That's why she had them all around her mouth all day.  And her fingers.  She's dead.  She'd have lived another 20 years, the dummy.  Stupid Aunt Viola.  Viola's a dumb bitch.  She was eating rocks and fucking shards of glass.  Is there anything worse when people talk about their really old relatives and the one thing 
[00:23:00]  they still could do on their own?  Is that the worst conversation?  Yeah.  You know, she's 95 and she washes her own face.  Right.  Wow, great.  She still makes her own phone calls.  Yeah.  She walks around the house.  There's no problem.  She still cooks for herself.  She still could use the remote and watch TV.  That's good.  You talk like a child when they first start doing stuff.  Yeah.  She's starting to walk.  Yeah.  It's good.  She's a little shaky. 
[00:23:30]  You go out the same way.  The one thing that they're still doing.  Yeah.  You know, about this death thing, and then we'll get back to that website.  You know, that time's a bitch.  Yeah, we have always said that.  And how can I say this?  And this is something for Danny.  What year was wiped out recently as far as people born in that year?  You know what I mean?  No.  How can I explain this?  The last living member of a year birth year.  Yeah.  Oh, oh. 
[00:24:00]  And you just watch those years tick in closer to your birth date.  You know what I mean?  Like, it's 2009, so you've got to think that everyone born in the 1800s are...  There's got to be a few.  There are a couple who are like 110.  1800s?  Anyone over 109.  Yeah.  Well, here's something.  One of the world's oldest women died recently.  This was only reported June 5th.  Okay.  And it says here that South African Moloko Timo, a grandmother of 29, passed away June 5th. 
[00:24:30]  Miss Timo said she was born on July 4th, 1874.  That's impossible.  So there are people still alive from the 1870s?  No, no.  She's lying.  What a mistake, man.  Or 1880s.  She's so old.  What the fuck does she know?  She's so old, she said.  Yeah.  1870s.  How far do we have to go back where anyone born in that year are...  They're all dead.  You know what I mean? 
[00:25:00]  I'm going to guess 1889 or the 80s.  We've got to be way up in the 1800s.  We've just got to find the oldest living person.  Yeah.  You know, that's it.  But there's a couple people like 115, 119 years old.  Australia's oldest man, 110 dies.  He was born in 1899.  Yeah, that's right.  So we're almost done with the 1800s.  Anyone born in the 1800s?  Yeah.  Dead.  That's what I'm thinking.  All right, whatever. 
[00:25:30]  Back to the fatty's bit.  We've got to figure out what E-Rock's eating.  All right.  Where are we at?  The lard thing?  We moved on?  Yeah.  This thing that you guys are looking at right now is called a Hawaiian meatloaf sandwich.  Oh, damn it.  This is number one on my list.  We were going to guess.  I wouldn't have guessed a Hawaiian sandwich.  Meatloaf with macaroni salad, gravy, and pineapple on a bun.  You've eaten this?  No, but I would like to try it.  Ah, ah.  Why?  Wait, you get to the third page before you get to stuff you want to try? 
[00:26:00]  All the stuff didn't entice you?  Not too much.  Why would you want to try that one?  That looks delicious.  Can't go wrong with meatloaf.  Would you do this bit if we could get these things?  Yeah.  I want to see you eat a deep-fried lard ball covered with sugar.  Bring in Mr. Lard.  How the fuck do we get that done?  Because that's the one that piqued everyone's interest.  Deep-fried...  Hawaiian meatloaf sandwich?  No, the lard ball.  I want them to try the other stuff that's really weird.  I'm sure we can make some phone calls, find a place around here that wouldn't mind deep-frying up some lard balls. 
[00:26:30]  But they have to know how to make it.  Where does the lard ball come from?  The deep-fried lard ball.  It has to be somewhere down south.  And then what?  They roll it in sugar or something?  Powdered sugar?  That's got to be awful.  No kidding.  That's why I want to eat rock.  Don't they make candles out of lard?  That sounds like a state fair kind of a fucking, you know, thing you would eat at a state fair.  Where?  In West Virginia?  Yeah, one of those, like, state fairs.  But in the middle of nowhere.  Yeah.  Well, Travis is telling me that he's got to deep-fry at his house and he wouldn't mind deep-frying up some lard balls for Eric. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, but he's got to know how to do it.  We'll get recipes.  All right.  I can just bring the deep-fryer in.  It plugs in.  All right, let's try it.  Would you try a deep-fried lard ball?  I'll try it.  Okay.  So that's the...  But the Hawaiian sandwich would be the first one you would try.  Yeah.  On the list.  All right.  Uh, what other ones?  We can go through this fast now.  Uh-oh.  You want me to just read it off?  You want me to just read it off there?  Yeah.  Okay.  Let her rip.  Uh, the second one is called, uh, Potachos. 
[00:27:30]  It's potato chips, cheddar, bacon, tomatoes, onions, ketchup, and sour cream.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, here's a picture.  Oh, it's like some kind of nachos, but only with potato chips and all those other things of goodness.  Can you imagine the farts after eating something like that?  Just those hot air farts.  Where your ass just opens real wide because of the pressure, but doesn't make that sound.  Like it's ready to sing opera. 
[00:28:00]  And it's all heat.  Heat that you feel on your hips.  Right.  That's how far it goes in your pants.  Your asshole's sighing.  That's a good way to look at it.  You ever dutch up?  How great is it like when you cut one of those under the sheets and then you wait just a few seconds and you lift it gently with your shoulder and allow the sheet to fall back?  It's like spoiled vegetables.  All right.  That's two.  The third one is called the bulldog.  It's hot dog and cheese deep fried in an egg roll. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  The egg roll messes that up.  Why would you eat that?  Why would you eat that?  Yeah.  The egg roll doesn't fit with the other stuff.  Eggs are never pleasurable.  Most people eat the eggs.  I love egg rolls.  For the health thing.  Well, egg rolls.  Oh, egg rolls.  I'm sorry.  Oh, okay.  But it doesn't really fit with the rest of the stuff.  I guess that's what I was getting at.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Although I did have something that's kind of close.  Well, not close to this, but it's an egg roll with steak and cheese inside.  It's like a deep fried.  It's like a Philly cheesesteak egg roll.  Oh, yeah.  And it's probably one of the most delicious things I've ever had in my entire life. 
[00:29:00]  I've had those.  Those are great.  You've had those.  Of course you have.  Is your wife to be disappointed that you're not trying to lose the weight anymore?  I think she's just given up.  Oh.  Whenever you're eating something, like some delicious piece of cheesecake, do you feel  her eyes just fucking boring to you?  Because you know she's looking at it, going like, oh, why is he doing this?  She's trying to be cool, but, you know, your chick is hot.  She's put together. 
[00:29:30]  Way out of your fucking league.  She takes care of herself.  Yeah.  Well, do you want her to just let herself go, too?  No.  Would that bother you?  Yeah, that might bother me.  Yeah.  All right.  Now you know how she feels.  Exactly.  And finally, what's the last dish?  The last dish before I came in here was corn dog casserole.  It's corn dogs cut and diced over hash browns and cheese.  You like the weirdest stuff.  You like weird cheese.  Yeah, yeah.  I never got into the corn dog thing.  Would any of these things that you're talking about give you a pizza problem? 
[00:30:00]  Wait, wait.  You got to go back.  That just looks like a cartoon.  I don't know.  It looks like something you'd see in fucking, like, in the kids' section at Disney.  It looks like it's made of Play-Doh.  Yeah.  That's because it's hamburger cake.  Oh, okay.  I don't know.  Does it look like a burger?  Yeah.  Wow.  What's the green shit?  I don't know.  That's marzipan.  It's marzipan.  What is marzipan?  I don't know.  It's some awful candy. 
[00:30:30]  It's horrible.  Someone's trying to turn us on to guessermuff.blogspot.com.  Oh, Motorhead.  Did that a week and a half ago, my friend.  That's the corn dog casserole.  Look at the corn dog.  Oh, it's mustard.  Sorry.  I thought it was cheese.  Oh, mustard on top of it.  You like corn dogs, huh?  That's like fucking a hundred corn dogs standing up in a little casserole dish.  With hash brown patties.  Hash browns, like, holding them together.  Crumbled bacon, baked beans, corn, french fries.  Jesus.  Topped by corn dog slices and mustard icing. 
[00:31:00]  Get out of here.  Mustard icing.  Mustard icing.  Yeah, okay.  Someone is saying check out heartattackgrill.com.  That'll give you a good one.  I don't know.  This site's pretty good, though.  This is why you're fat.com.  Yeah.  I'm digging it.  Let's look at heart attack grill.  Look at the graphics on heart attack grill.  It's got an EKG.  It's got an EKG and then it flatlines.  Oh, come on.  There's no way.  What?  They're just listing stuff that'll bring you closer to a heart attack? 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Single bypass burger, double bypass burger, triple and quad.  Bypass burgers, jolt cola, no filter cigarettes, flatliner fries.  It doesn't really.  Hey, you hear this?  It's not as fun.  Did you hear the story about cigarettes today?  What?  They're good for you?  Finally.  Something they've been working on for 20 years.  Oh, I did.  Yeah.  I heard this.  And this is a trick in the trade there.  It's all semantics.  Well, they do this with everything, by the way. 
[00:32:00]  They do this with all sorts of products.  Yeah.  But we're getting closer to taking the word light off cigarette packaging.  And both sides are pretty much agreeing, even though the cigarette companies know that this will cost them even more money.  What is a Marlboro light compared to a Marlboro?  Like, what makes it a light?  Well, basically, the doctors would say technically not much of a difference.  But in your head, as a consumer, you see light, and you go, oh, okay, this has got to be way better for me than a regular cigarette. 
[00:32:30]  Cigarette?  Cigarette.  Cigarette.  All right.  A regular cigarette.  Yeah.  But in fact, it's not.  Right.  Yes.  But if you're, like, convincing yourself that you're being healthy by smoking Newport lights.  Well, they're trying to say a lot of people aren't educated enough, and they really believe that if they smoke light cigarettes, they could smoke a lot more before they...  Well, they're stupid and should be thinned from the herd.  Ah.  So I say let them, let them, I say let them die. 
[00:33:00]  All right, D-Rock, thank you.  So those butts.  Good job, Eric.  Good.  Good job on what?  Being fast?  So they're going to, they're actually going to do that with the cigarettes?  Huh?  They're actually going to do that with the cigarettes?  Or are they still working on it?  Because that's going to cost a fortune.  Not a, not a, yeah, we're still a little ways away, but we're heading toward that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's good.  Yeah, they both agree.  But they know that it has to be done at this point.  So.  Damn, yo.  What do we know in the Holocaust Museum from yesterday?  Oh, this guy seems like a real pleasure. 
[00:33:30]  Pleasure for me.  I didn't know it was an old guy.  Yeah, 88 years old.  And his wife said that he's been preaching hate for something like 50 years.  Was he 88?  Because that's an odd, uh...  88's a...  88's a number that a white supremacist, uh...  I want to say he was...  Identify with.  I was going to say...  He was 88.  88.  See?  Because that's H-H in the alphabet.  You think he's just been waiting until he turns 88 to do this?  Maybe.  Knowing the significance of 88?  Maybe.  I'll find out when his birthday is, if he waited a little while, or if it was like, you know, 
[00:34:00]  the day before yesterday or something.  But, yeah, he's been preaching, uh...  Anti-Semitism, um...  His whole life.  White supremacy.  And then, uh, you know, he figured, uh, he'd go to the Holocaust Museum and cause a little, uh...  To-do?  A to-do.  Shot one of the guards, killed him.  Uh, he had a problem a few years back, too.  He went to the, um...  He went to the, uh, what bank is that?  The one that runs the whole country?  Bill Burr talks about it all the time. 
[00:34:30]  The Federal Reserve.  Oh, Federal Reserve, okay.  Yeah, he went there because the interest rates were, like, really sky-high back then.  And he went there with a bunch of guns and stuff and was gonna make a citizen's arrest on somebody over there.  What a fucking asshole.  Yeah, exactly.  And, uh, he was, he was summarily wrestled to the ground and arrested.  How do you think that's gonna work out for you?  Put in prison for, uh, a few years.  Uh, but, you know, he got out, 88 years old, decides he's gonna go to the, uh, Holocaust Museum and, uh, start shooting.  And they took him out right away? 
[00:35:00]  Uh, well, they...  They killed a guard.  Witnesses said that they heard some shots and heard guards yelling, put the gun down, put the gun down, and then they heard more shots.  So, um, yeah.  Wow.  They, uh, they got him.  Yeah, this guy was just, uh, he's been, he's been a little intolerant for quite a few years.  He finally had it.  Finally got to him.  Yeah, yeah.  Light cigarettes have tiny little holes in the filters, so you're taking less smoke.  Oh, that's...  That's all it is. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, that, I used to, I used to put my fingers over the holes in the filter.  If I had a bum, like, uh, Parliament or something like that, they have those holes.  You would notice it, man?  Yeah, yeah.  You would just hold the filter around where the holes are and smoke it like that.  So, I'm not, I'm not a smoker.  I would assume if there's holes in the filters and you're a cigarette smoker, that's going to bother you to the point where you're just going to, like, suck on the cigarette a lot more.  Yeah, you'll smoke more.  Or do what you did and cover up some of those holes.  That's what they've said.  To get more of, uh, the smoke, right? 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, yeah.  They say you smoke more if you smoke light cigarettes.  Oh, yeah, okay.  Yeah, so it's really not helping.  Because you haven't satisfied the craving, so you're just going to light up faster?  Yep.  Not like a nice, uh, Marlboro.  Nice Marlboro red.  What was better than a nice, fresh pack?  Yeah, give me a...  Having two packs.  Having two packs.  Danny's so right.  And you'd just be like, alright, pack that thing a little bit.  And then, and open it up and, oh, take that little foil out. 
[00:36:30]  And there it is, the first one.  Nice and fresh.  Did you like smoking?  I loved it!  Did you really?  Who didn't like smoking?  Everyone that quit smoking liked smoking.  That's why they had to quit.  It wasn't just like, oh, I'm stopping this.  It's called quitting.  You gotta quit.  You enjoyed smoking, didn't you, Jim?  I did enjoy smoking.  Yes.  But I didn't want to die with a fucking big thing on my tongue or my gums.  Half your jaw missing, trying to pick up chicks.  Yeah.  They're fucking shoving hookers in your face as they're screaming, trying to make them kiss you. 
[00:37:00]  Like Roger Ebert.  Just thumbs-upping prostitutes when they show up.  Oh, poor Ebert.  Let me say hi to Mike in Boston.  Mike, how did the Red Sox do last night?  They beat the Yankees again?  Yeah.  God damn.  Did they?  Oh.  The Yankees can't seem to win against the Red Sox.  Boston now a perfect 7-0 versus the Yankees this year.  Yeah, there's a 7-0.  6-5 last night.  The Yankees can't win against the Sox. 
[00:37:30]  What do you got, Mike?  You're right there, brother.  Hey there, Mike.  Come on.  Jesus Christ.  He looks silly without a jawbone.  Who is that?  It's a guy that had his jaw removed.  Yeah, some guy with oral cancer.  He's holding the skull up, yeah.  Yeah, never mind.  No, you're there.  You're there, Mike.  Oh, great.  What's happening, boys?  Hey, Mikey.  Hang on, waiting for you.  What's going on?  Not too much.  I was calling because of the Grand Torino.  I don't know how the Sox did last night.  I had to wake up early this morning to go to work.  But that old dude reminds me of the dude from Grand Torino. 
[00:38:00]  I finally saw that last night.  And holy shit, is that funny.  Oh, yeah.  The racist comments in that thing are priceless.  Yeah, he didn't go the full distance, though, with the black guys.  But who explained that?  They said that.  I think it was Jimmy who said an older dude would probably.  No, I don't know.  Did I say that?  Was it you?  I don't know.  Somebody explained that.  I heard he wouldn't say nigger.  That was the word that he refused.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he used spook.  Yeah.  Which I guess maybe that's what someone would use more often.  I don't know.  It was a very popular one when Honky was popular. 
[00:38:30]  It was almost like it was like he was doing it like it worked for that character, to tell  you the truth.  And I'm the first one to go like, ah, boy, he would say this or that or the other thing.  But it was almost like a friendly greeting to him.  He wasn't pulling up like with a bad attitude.  He pulled up like with this friendly greeting.  Yeah, it's just the way the guy was, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  He was racist.  By the way, boys, enjoy a nice pack of Pal Mals. 
[00:39:00]  They're so delicious and smooth.  Pal Mals.  Remember that?  Yeah.  You guys had that on a little while ago.  All right, boys.  Punch it out.  Later.  All right, Mikey.  There you go.  Yeah, absolutely.  There's some, what am I trying to say?  White supremacists in Grand Arena.  Yeah.  The, you know, I guess you get that.  Every so often, these lunatics come out of the woodwork.  It's, you know, there's no stopping the. 
[00:39:30]  The hate?  The errant lunatic.  They are making a thing where they're trying to figure out how to stop this intolerance and  stuff.  But it's impossible.  It's impossible.  It's impossible.  You can't.  There's always going to be the rogue, the renegade, the one guy that doesn't care that will go  out and wreak havoc.  All right.  I'm looking at something in front of us.  We're going to take a break. 
[00:40:00]  And I would have sworn this is old, but it's brand new.  Danny DeVito.  Remember when he went on, what show was it?  And he was all fucked up?  The View, I believe.  Was it The View?  Yeah.  It says Danny DeVito on, okay, local Philly news from the set of It's Always Sunny, which  I hear is a great show.  I got the box set.  I still haven't watched.  You watch?  Yeah.  I hear it's great.  I've seen like a couple of seasons and it is very funny.  I'm too lazy to start a new show.  I got a lot of DVD box sets and I'm just too lazy.  Yeah.  To commit. 
[00:40:30]  Well, he's on this local Philly news show, drunk and drinking beer at eight in the morning.  And we got some audio.  It's with him.  I don't know.  And also Letterman is in a bit of trouble.  Actually, it's great for Letterman.  And they're also saying that Letterman beat Conan last night or a couple nights ago.  Well, that's not really a surprise.  He's more familiar with the people in that slot.  I mean, Conan had that big boost, that big spike when he first came on the first couple  of days, I guess. 
[00:41:00]  But Conan has to settle in and then he's got to build from there, right?  That's sort of how it works.  There's a bunch of hype when you first start something.  They expect you to lose a lot.  You're dropping every night, but they do expect that.  They write that in.  They know that you're going to lose 20% of your audience the next night or whatever.  Because people are just watching your first show just to see what you're doing.  And they're not comfortable with you yet.  And then you build from there.  Right.  Too early to tell who's going to win that battle.  Letterman and Conan.  But Letterman all over the news, over his Sarah Palin joke. 
[00:41:30]  We'll explain after the break.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  There's a couple things going on.  Opie and Anthony, very, very busy show.  So I went to the bathroom, walked in, and I almost hit the floor from the smell that's 
[00:42:00]  coming from this bathroom.  It was unbelievable.  Really?  You know, I think people can relate.  You go to work and you've got to deal with other people's smells.  And it just sucks.  But you get through it, right?  Of course.  You're like, oh, that's awful.  But you go about your business.  The smell from this bathroom today is unbelievable.  It is unbelievable.  I can't even describe it.  That smells always unpleasant.  But this was like a really visceral reaction to it.  It's the worst I've ever smelled.  So I ran back to the studio because the bathroom is a long way from our studio. 
[00:42:30]  All excited.  I'm like, someone has to run down there and go in that bathroom so I can share how awful  this experience was.  Because that's what you do.  I want to share the awfulness.  We all do it, though.  How about this, dude?  One of our guys can go into that bathroom eating an egg salad sandwich.  In the next stall.  So I come back in the studio.  The rock's gagging.  Right.  I come back to the studio and people, everyone's aware of the smell.  But no one's, I'm the first one to bring it up to everybody. 
[00:43:00]  Well, you were on the air, so we didn't.  Oh, it happened while we were still doing our first break?  Okay.  So Ope asked, he's like, can you go and get a photo?  So as soon as I walk in.  Yeah, I wanted the photo.  Sorry, Anthony asked.  As soon as I walk in, I didn't know Danny was in one of the stalls.  As soon as I walk in, Danny just yells out, that smell's not for me.  And Danny doesn't even care about, like, embarrassment or things like that.  So he didn't know who it was walked in.  That's the first thing he yells.  He's like, that smell's not for me. 
[00:43:30]  And then.  Why's Matt in here?  Oh, because Matt was there and he witnessed all this, too.  Okay.  So somebody desecrated the handicapped stall.  And it's a really wide door that's open.  So it takes up about a quarter of the amount of stalls that are there.  It looks like two people shit in the same toilet and then didn't flush it.  And it's above the water.  It has to be.  This looks almost like cake.  Can I see it?  Okay.  It has to be.  Cake.  It has to be above the water because that's the only way you'll get that type of smell. 
[00:44:00]  That water is really important.  Water is so important.  So important to dump in.  I remember people, you know, dumping in these spackle buckets when I was on the job sites.  And without water in there, the smell's horrendous.  You ever take a dump in the woods or something like that?  Oh, yeah.  It just, it wafts everywhere.  It's horrible.  Jim Florentine.  Jim could be the funniest guy ever.  Jim's very funny, yeah.  When he was doing, like, manual labor things.  He said it was one summer he was working with this guy.  And Jim took a fucking huge shit in his spackle bucket and put it in the back of the guy's 
[00:44:30]  van.  And it was in the summer.  Oh, God.  And it was the guy who was driving around all day.  And his fucking van reeked of shit.  And Jim buried it so the guy couldn't find it.  And the guy had to tear his van apart to find the spackle bucket of shit.  That's the fault.  That rules.  What is it with humans?  We could smell shit from animals?  Still not happy, but you'll deal with that.  That's awful.  But as soon as you smell human shit, it just takes you to a much darker.  Dude, I feel nauseous in that smell.  And you just looked at the picture and your face doesn't look good. 
[00:45:00]  What's up with the picture, Jimmy?  Dude, it looks like a.  Oh, no.  It looks like when you chew a piece of jerky.  It looks like a piece of.  This is the zoomed out one.  Okay, now this is the zoomed in one.  Ah, fuck.  Dude, it looks like fucking jerky.  I'm never nauseous with shit.  I relish it.  Zoomed out one.  And that's the zoomed out one.  Just look for whoever's walking around and can't, like, sit. 
[00:45:30]  Or whoever can't stop smiling.  If that was my dump, I'd be the happiest man in serious.  Yeah, that's why he left it there.  Of course he did.  He's very proud of it.  That looks like he.  Would you flush the Mona Lisa?  Of course not.  Oh.  That looks like a part of an intestine or something.  Yeah, it looks like his insides came out.  Holy fuck.  Can we please send some.  I want to send one of our guys in there to fucking stand in that stall and eat egg salad.  That couldn't work.  E-Rock's gagging.  He's walking down the hall with his hand over his mouth. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, it's unbelievable.  Larry King checking in on instant feedback.  So how important is the water in the bowl?  Very, Larry.  Larry.  Larry.  I was talking about a nightmare I had.  Oh, right.  Over the break.  Your nightmare scared the fuck out of me and it wasn't my nightmare.  It was so creepy.  Like, I love storyline nightmares.  I have them pretty much every night.  Like, I have some kind of a...  It would qualify as a nightmare instead of a dream. 
[00:46:30]  But it kind of straddles the line of dream and nightmare.  It's very story driven.  You know, I'll start out somewhere.  It might end up weird where I end up in a weird situation or something.  But it's usually somebody's after me.  Or there's some kind of creepy thing happening.  But since it's story driven, like, I'm involved in it.  So it's harder for me to concentrate on the real evil, horrible, nightmarish parts.  Because I'm kind of busy. 
[00:47:00]  I'm looking for a weapon.  I'm looking for that.  I'm just doing things.  This one last night was just...  I was laying in bed.  And there was this horrible old woman leaning over my bed.  And she looked like the old woman in the tub from The Shining.  Like, that type of face.  And she was just screaming.  Like, in pain.  Like, right in front of my face.  So I grabbed her face to, like, push her away.  And my fingers went right into her flesh.  And I started ripping her face apart and pulling her eyes out and shit. 
[00:47:30]  And, like, ripping her jaw off.  And she just kept going, ah!  Like, screaming.  And I woke up like, ah!  Ah!  It was horrible.  You know what that means?  That dream probably symbolized it.  What did it mean?  You're afraid of a person screaming in your face.  Even though you're pulling their face off, they still yell.  It's just, every dream interpretation is completely literal. 
[00:48:00]  You're afraid that they'll make a noise that's the same once their face is off.  Is off.  And the horror of having a ripped face off in your hands would also be very disturbing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Stuff all over your hands on your comforter.  Thank you, Dr. Jimmy.  That's a good one.  Now, I'm sure there's people out there that read dreams.  Yeah.  And I bet you the number one thing is going to be, you feel guilty about something.  Guilty?  Maybe.  Is there always guilt?  Maybe.  Does it always have to be guilt?  Maybe that you didn't see your grandma before she died or something. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, that might be a good one.  That might be one.  But what's the screaming?  That's a good one.  Maybe.  But I don't.  I kind of feel good that I saw her, you know.  As a healthy woman.  As a healthy, yeah.  A healthy woman making the sauce.  Yeah.  Making the sauce.  Maybe the old lady's yelling in your face, and even though you're clawing at the face,  you can't make the screaming stop.  So, like, whatever the problem is, you can't make it go away by doing the obvious.  By just clawing at it.  Yeah, and I guarantee you, when you look at the bottom of that old lady screaming, it's  a keg. 
[00:49:00]  Could very well be.  You will let me know when those beers stop screaming.  Was she yelling at...  Dr. Norton?  Dr. Norton?  Was she yelling anything at you?  No.  It was just like this screaming, and her head was kind of moving back and forth, and she  was just there.  And as her face came apart in my hands, I was like, oh, my God.  And then I'm trying to say to myself, I'm going, is this a dream?  Because, you know, this is real fucked up. 
[00:49:30]  And then it hit me like, oh, my God, this might not be a dream.  Like, even though I thought it might be.  Oh, I hate those.  I couldn't get myself to where...  Because if I all of a sudden just went, oh, it's a dream, I'd have punched her in the  face.  I'd have grabbed her head and put it on my dick or something.  Yeah, but you're...  Whatever.  You're the only person I know that could control a dream like that.  Yeah.  Once I know I'm dreaming, then I can do whatever I please in him, and it's great.  It's his superpowers.  Some people can sort of control the dreams.  Lucid dreaming, they call it.  Yeah.  You know when you're playing like Grand Theft Auto and you can sort of control like the 
[00:50:00]  boats?  Yeah, yeah.  You can kind of do that with your dreams.  You know what I mean?  You can kind of get in the direction you need.  Yeah, kind of getting there.  But a motorcycle, you know, you're completely controlling that for the most part in GTA.  You can't do that with your dreams.  Dreams are weird.  If I know I'm dreaming, I can definitely do kind of what I want to do.  Which is a lot of fun, because then I don't care how creepy, how scary, I laugh at that  point.  But then sometimes it'll stop, and I won't know I'm dreaming again, even though I knew 
[00:50:30]  I was.  But most of the time, once I start knowing I'm dreaming, I get into stuff I really like  doing, and then I'll wake up, which really blows, because what I like doing is raping  and pillaging in dreams, because you do it with impunity.  The best part of your story, you're not sure it's a dream.  You ever have a dream, like a scenario, all of a sudden you're dreaming that you're friends  with a butterfly, let's just say, and all of a sudden you wake up and you go, oh, thank 
[00:51:00]  God that was a dream.  Duh.  You know what I mean?  It's so, the scenario in your dream is so ridiculous that you should even understand that  it's a dream as you're dreaming.  The thank God I'm up dreams are the ones where I'm in big trouble with the cops or something,  or I'm in jail, awaiting trial for something, and I'm like, oh my God, I'm in jail and  I'm going to go to prison.  But those are the ones you wake up from and go, thank God, it was a dream, and that's  logical.  I'm talking about these whacked out ones.  All the ones that really make no sense. 
[00:51:30]  Like I said, all of a sudden you happen to be a friend with a butterfly or something that  just doesn't make sense in real life.  What would you talk, even in a dream, what would you talk to a butterfly about?  You try to talk to them about your day and it just keeps fluttering?  You just rub the powder off its wings so it can't fly.  It really needs that powder.  Does it really?  Yeah.  Like, I used to rub the white powder off of moths.  Yeah, you were just trying to clean them off.  And you wipe the powder off and then you let them go and they just kind of flop around. 
[00:52:00]  They can't fly without that powder on their wings.  And you thought they were just dusty.  Yeah.  It's like, oh, you're dusty.  Butterflies scare me.  When I see one fluttering around, I don't know why they really freak me out.  They're a little fluttery things.  Yeah, it looks like just, you know, bug on me.  They just creep me out.  Oh, Joel.  What, what, what, what?  God.  What, why are you whispering?  What are you whispering for?  What happened?  I want you in there.  I just saw something disgusting.  I got you.  The smell.  I can still taste the smell. 
[00:52:30]  I like the voice you made.  Oh, the smell.  I can taste it.  I can taste it.  Nice, perfect.  Let's go to the phones.  Marcos in New York.  Marcos.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hey, man.  Wait, Google old hag.  It's a paranormal phenomenon that matches Ant's dream.  Exactly.  Really?  All right.  Old hag?  Something like that.  Marcos.  New old bag.  Got a bad old crow at that.  Marcos.  Hey, I was going to say, you guys were talking about taking a shit earlier. 
[00:53:00]  I got a question.  Why is it that you smell someone else's shit, or you walk into the bathroom, someone taking  a shit, smelling a fart, it grosses you out, but you're able to withstand your own, and  actually, some people like the smell of their own scent.  Dude, that's as philosophical a question as Nietzsche would ask.  I don't know.  What's going on to that?  Can I take it further?  Why is it that you could eat your own snot, but if someone else, like, presented you their 
[00:53:30]  snot on their finger, why is it, though?  How come you can swallow your spit all day long?  All day long?  You do.  But the second you spit it out, like, you wouldn't spit it into a cup, and then drink it back.  Oh, good God, no.  But it's in your mouth the whole time, and you're swallowing saliva.  It's pretty much the same thing, right?  It's not pretty much.  It's exactly the same thing.  Yeah.  How about this?  Some of the unanswered questions, my friend.  Yes.  I don't know, Marcos.  Yeah, why can't you spit your own spit and drink? 
[00:54:00]  I've been doing that for years.  I didn't realize how weird that was.  Like, in case of you thirsty, I'll spit into a glass.  A lot of times, I'll just keep it with me in my coat pocket.  In a canteen.  And I'll let somebody smell it, and then I'll drink it.  Oh, we got people that want in on your dream badly.  All right.  But first, Kelly in Connecticut.  Kelly.  Good morning, boys.  Hi.  Hi.  So, this has happened to me twice, and it was prior to me marrying my husband.  One time, I came in the house.  The smell of his shit was so bad, I puked instantly in the kitchen. 
[00:54:30]  You puked.  So, what did you do?  You signed up to be with that forever.  Yeah.  Oh, this is love.  I call it charity myself.  Okay.  Wow.  The second time it happened, I'm taking the shower.  He says he has to go to the bathroom with us.  That's fine.  This shit was so bad, I puked all over the fucking shower.  Jesus.  What is he eating at night?  Oh, I have no idea.  But he's a keeper, all right.  Jimmy's an expert, though.  What do you think this guy's eating that his wife is puking like this? 
[00:55:00]  I mean, some nasty combination.  I'm not sure.  I don't know.  A lot of cheeses and lactose and things like that.  The sour food, like fucking burrito.  Yeah, yeah.  Mexican spices.  What does he do for a living?  He's a truck driver.  All right.  So he's on the run.  He's eating fast food.  Oh, God.  And probably, like, his roids are making a stink, too.  Because half of the asshole is falling out.  Ugh. 
[00:55:30]  He's pink-socking.  Oh, God.  How did you marry this guy?  It's been a long time.  We've lived together for seven years.  I got a lot of shit to move out.  Oh, yeah.  It just comes down to that after a while.  It's like, eh, it's too inconvenient to leave him.  I like that, Kelly.  You're right.  You start looking around like, eh.  All right.  Have a good day.  Then I'm going to have to move all this shit somewhere else.  Ugh.  Uh, let's go to Steve, who's going to interpret. 
[00:56:00]  Good morning, gents.  Hey, Steve.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Steve.  Oh, my birthday's being overshot, right?  You go ahead.  I'm doing good.  Yes, sir.  Yeah, buddy.  All right, Anthony.  You're a guy who goes to above-average efforts to maintain his safety.  If you look at your dream, you were unable to defend yourself, so you're feeling very vulnerable  and very scared by something.  It happens in your bed, where people typically feel very safe.  Yes.  You know, that's where they sleep.  Yes.  Uh, the other thing I hear is the woman with an old hat. 
[00:56:30]  Okay, now, I'm not passing judgment, but you're a guy who's basically living a lifestyle  usually reserved for people younger than yourself.  So maybe she represents what you're fearful of, growing old.  Oh, the old person.  Oh, shit.  Oh, and I'm trying to claw it, saying, get away, get away, but no, it keeps creeping up  on me.  All right.  That means I've got to jack the age down on the girls.  Going for 16 now.  Yeah.  16.  Next thing, the person screaming in his face would be a girl who's of legal voting age. 
[00:57:00]  She'd just start peeling her face apart.  I made a decision.  I made a decision.  Are there any old tags in color?  Are you serious?  Maybe that's it.  Yeah, the old lady had little dog logos on her eyes.  They're all old tags.  All right, I'm punching out, guys.  Wow.  All right.  There's something there.  No, Ant?  I don't know.  Well, you know, any of these things, if you're not making a joke about it, it makes sense.  So who the fuck knows?  Paffer Munaki writes, some people ponder the nature of the universe, and Opie ponders snot 
[00:57:30]  eating.  It's the same shit.  And friendships with butterflies.  Yeah.  Oh, that was just a dumb...  Yes.  ...reaching for an example type thing.  That was a sweet voice.  You've had friends with butterfly dreams.  No, I was...  Of course he has.  I was friends with Obama.  I told you the story.  Yeah.  And then I blew it, and he's never appeared in my dreams again, so I guess that friendship  is over.  How'd you blow it?  You ruined dreamy friendship.  In my dream, we were having a good time.  We were hanging out as buds, and he was like, oh, this guy's pretty cool. 
[00:58:00]  And then he had something else to do, and he goes, all right, I'll call you soon, and  I had to be all needy.  Like, when?  Are you sure?  Oh, see.  When are you going to call?  And then he did...  He gave you a weird look, right?  He did the double take of my dream, like, oh, wait, maybe this guy isn't as cool as I  thought I was.  I thought it was cool, but he just wants to hang me because I'm not me, and...  No, no, and then there was something like, no, no, I'll call you, but I could tell in  my dreams he's never calling me.  He wasn't going to call.  What tipped him off that you weren't cool?  Was it when he realized that when you approached him, you and your butterfly power hanging out 
[00:58:30]  and chatting?  I knew my example would get me in trouble.  How could it not?  I was friends with Casper, the friendly ghost, when I was a kid.  In your dreams?  In my dream.  And then Casper...  And now you love the clan.  That's pretty fucking obvious.  But then Casper took a shit, and I saw the shit through him because he's a ghost.  So I saw the shit inside of him working its way through, and then it fell out, you  know, his Casper, the friendly ghost, ass, and he took a shit, and I felt all weird that 
[00:59:00]  my new friend Casper, the friendly ghost, took a shit.  And that was it?  Yeah, that was it.  They were like little cotton balls all over the floor.  No, it was a brown piece of shit.  Jesus.  That's why I saw it inside of him moving around, and then it fell out of him.  How often would that be if a little ghost was woo-hooing and just taking really human-sized  shits on your rug?  Poltergeist.  How would you explain that to people?  He's friendly unless he has to go to the bathroom, but he's very aggressive.  He just shits on your rug.  Yes, he's socially very angry.  Let's say hi to Mike in Boston.  Mike?  Hey. 
[00:59:30]  You know, maybe, uh, maybe Ed's dream has something to do with the old lady that got  tased yesterday.  Uh, hmm.  Maybe.  You know, something that's a good idea.  See, I would take that sooner than I would some kind of deep-seated bullshit, uh, uh, psycho  babble that I did see that, and right before I went to sleep, uh, the news was playing  that clip, so that could definitely be it.  Mm-hmm.  The old bag yelling, screaming, and she was screaming when she got tased. 
[01:00:00]  What movie were you watching when you were falling asleep?  Because you-  I was watching the military channel.  I was watching, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, what was it?  Heinrich Himmler.  Mm-hmm.  I was watching a little special on Heinrich Himmler.  We've all had the dream where you're watching a little porn or something before you fall  asleep, and then you get the best fucking sex dreams?  Yeah.  How- why can't we make that work every time?  Mm-hmm.  That would be nice.  Yeah.  Or you're watching some horrific film before you go to sleep, like The Shining or something,  something scary, and then- 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Then your dream's like, what the fuck, dude?  I don't need this.  No, I always have the history channel on, or the military channel, so it's a lot of, uh,  a lot of, um, bombings, gunfire, a lot of Hitler.  In your dreams, though?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, things like that.  It segs right over sometimes.  Uh, thank you, sir.  Let's go to Pat in Jersey.  Pat.  Pat.  Hey, boys.  Hey, buddy.  What's happening, man?  Yo, Ed, in this stream, do you have really furry fingers and start tearing all ladies apart  like a chip in Connecticut?  Like what? 
[01:01:00]  Oh, the chimp.  Oh, ripping apart a woman's face like the chimpanzee.  No, I don't.  You wanted to, uh, destroy this thing.  I just wanted it away from me.  Right, and it was very scary.  It was very, like, right up in my face.  Like, the worst thing you could ever do is if I'm sleeping and I open my eyes is to be  right there in my face.  I will, I will just, like, claw, I will probably literally claw someone's face off.  Of course. 
[01:01:30]  Like a chimpanzee.  I think I was asking you during the break, you ever have a dream so bad that you're scared  to wake up in your own house in the middle of the night because your brain isn't, like,  fully functioning, I guess?  It's still almost, some of it is still shutting down in dream mode.  We're not talking about being a kid.  Like, you're an adult.  Yeah.  Got a good life.  You have a horrendous dream and you wake up in the middle of the night and you're scared  of your own room, your own house.  Yeah.  What is that about?  I don't know.  And then if you just were awake just for a few more minutes, you'd realize how ridiculous  that is.  Fucking old lady face. 
[01:02:00]  No way.  Clawing old lady face.  I think that guy was right about an age.  That would make a good one.  A good sense.  It's scary.  Sure.  You want another shit phone call?  Todd in PA.  Todd.  Hey, how you doing, fellas?  Hey, buddy.  When I was in school, the big prank that we used to play on each other was we'd take a  Tupperware container and just take a nice muddy shit in it and then stick it in people's  refrigerators.  And then sometimes it would take a month, but it, you know, the whole refrigerator smelled  like shit. 
[01:02:30]  It ruined all your food.  It was awful.  Ugh.  I think I got to apologize to Todd.  I wasn't paying attention.  Where did he doodle?  Because I have something in front of me that will definitely infuriate a lot of people,  including, I think, Jimmy.  Oh.  I hope.  I don't want to be angry.  I'm not really sure.  No.  You're going to be like, this is ridiculous.  PETA is getting involved with something.  You want to play a little game?  Try to figure it out?  Incidentally, just before I forget. 
[01:03:00]  Do you know this story yet?  But I'm saying Ingrid Newkirk is doing some kind of a signing in the Time Warner building.  I don't know when it is.  We're going to try to get her in, though, before I forget that.  She started PETA.  She'd be a very interesting guest.  PETA.  PETA is involved with something so ridiculous, I can't even tell you.  Is it something that's in the news recently?  No.  Just something that has been going on for a really long time they have a problem with.  Clubbing seals? 
[01:03:30]  No, because a lot of people wouldn't put that in the ridiculous category.  I mean, this is a ridiculous one.  This isn't a gray area.  This is just ridiculous.  What are you doing?  Why are you getting involved with this?  That's your clue.  Ask a few questions, Ant.  Let's see if we can do this.  All right.  It has to do with animals.  Boy, Ant.  All right.  It's a tradition that's been happening for a long time.  That's a pretty good clue, too.  Oh, that at least sets you in a direction.  Running of the bulls? 
[01:04:00]  No.  They won't do that.  A tradition.  Is it some type of old Eskimo or Indian tradition?  No.  Something like that?  Okay.  So it's something that's not a niche thing.  I want to see if you can get to this point.  Okay.  You're still far away.  The animals die when it happens.  They've been doing it for a long time.  It's a tradition.  Are the animals what, Jimmy? 
[01:04:30]  They die while it's happening.  They're already dead.  Santeria.  Another clue.  Already dead?  Already dead.  Is it the dead goat fucking ritual?  Wait, are they dead?  They've got to be dead.  Huh?  The dead goat fucking thing?  No.  No.  No.  Fishing.  Fish?  Has to do with fish.  Are you looking down?  No.  Swear.  Okay.  Has to do with fish. 
[01:05:00]  Has to do with dead fish.  We're getting closer.  With dead fish.  Pete is getting involved.  With feeding dead fish to dolphins at marine parks.  Wow.  I reached for that one.  I think they've got to understand that.  Yeah.  They've got to feed dead fish.  All right.  Something to do with dead fish.  Grunions.  What's grunions?  All right.  They wash up on shore in California.  I hope I'm right about the dead fish. 
[01:05:30]  They're onions from like the 90s.  I'd have to.  I mean, it's great.  It's very clever.  It stinks.  It certainly does.  But it's clever.  Not always funny.  That's the lesson for people today.  Yes, I know.  What's going on today?  Okay.  Fish.  Dead fish.  Oh, here it is.  You found it?  No, I have it somewhere.  You want to play it?  You sure they're dead?  I don't know now.  I think they are, though.  Is it at home?  Fish tanks?  They're dead, right, Danny?  Okay. 
[01:06:00]  Flushing.  Which makes this so much more ridiculous.  A tradition with dead fish is definitely with fishing.  With a rod and reel fishing type thing.  Mm-hmm.  Fish are already out of the water.  Dead fish already out of the water.  Are they dead?  Hold on.  What the hell do you use them for?  If they're out of the water, they've got to be dead.  Then I'm walking around driving.  They're alive.  Not according to Danny.  I'm reading it right here.  Oh, this is inferior.  Oh, wait. 
[01:06:30]  Maybe they are.  I apologize.  Maybe they are.  All right.  Dead fish already out of the water.  PETA has a problem.  Okay.  The fishmongers that throw the fish back and forth to each other.  Motherfucker, give yourself a motherfucking bale.  God damn.  God damn, give yourself a bale.  God damn nice.  Wow.  What the fuck would they care?  Exactly.  Fish throwing is part of Seattle.  Delivery Thursday.  Delivery Thursday. 
[01:07:00]  The Pike Place Market fish throwers are so well known,  the nation's vets ask them to be the opening act of their vaginas.  Their pussies stink.  The nation's vets ask them to be the opening act at their convention.  Well, we think that it sends a terrible message to the public  when veterinarians call it fun to toss around the corpses of animals.  You heard the...  Holy shit. 
[01:07:30]  You know, you've gone a little far, dummy.  I think PETA has finally run out of things to go after.  All animals are safe now, and they've gotten to this point, I guess.  Are you kidding me?  It's fun to toss around the corpses of animals.  You heard right.  PETA is taking on the fish tossers.  Their reaction?  We respect everything you see here.  We respect the fish.  Without any respect for this fish, we wouldn't exist.  Well, you know, fish feel pain and fear just like dogs and cats do. 
[01:08:00]  How do you know?  And I don't think that the AVMA would dare take part in the dead kitten toss.  The convention is still a month away.  PETA says it'll gather signatures.  They'd better not try here.  I think the only difference is that we don't...  I don't think PETA's totally wrong.  They are.  But we don't eat...  Kittens.  Dead kittens.  So these guys are throwing something that they're actually displaying,  and then we're going to eat it.  They'd probably throw it as a part of their job to make it easier.  Like, all right, here, stack this, stack this. 
[01:08:30]  Of course.  That's how it all started.  That's how it started, yeah.  Right.  And the fish...  It's a fish.  It doesn't make an expression, so...  Stop it.  It's dead already.  It's dead already.  Isn't that amazing?  A dead kitten toss.  That would be funny.  We're going to do that on the show, but management stepped in.  What?  They really did?  Yeah.  I was going to do it on the show.  Oh, man.  I was going to bring it up so we could actually have dead kitten toss.  What would management say?  I don't know.  Exactly.  I didn't feel like finding it. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  It's all right.  Pete is ridiculous with some of this shit.  I mean, some of the stuff I agree with.  Some of the stuff...  If we're going to be honest here, but I mean, when it gets to fish tossing, shut the fuck up.  Anything in the ocean is fair game, if you ask me.  Because they're monsters.  All right, that one's still...  Oh, no.  He was flicking the tail.  It made it seem like it was alive.  He's dead.  Even if it's alive, how else are you supposed to get the fish from one area to another?  Yeah.  And it's like a tourist attraction thing.  You can't really carry them.  People kind of like watching people throw a fish around for some reason. 
[01:09:30]  I don't know why.  It's just stupid.  Look at this fat fuck holding a dead fish.  She probably smells.  There's krill in her teeth.  Wait, where are we at?  What up, Israel?  Just messing with us.  No.  You know what?  The fish tosses are douchebags.  They must smell.  You can't wash that shit off.  Why are they douchebags?  They're doing a job, Jimmy.  Just do the job.  But don't throw the...  It's just stupid.  Hey, ho!  Here it is!  Hey!  He throws a fish.  That's what they've been doing. 
[01:10:00]  I know.  Who would want to watch that?  I don't know.  People go down there.  Seattle.  They go to the seaport there and watch them.  Why only Seattle?  Why did it become big in Seattle?  No, they do it.  They do it in New York.  They used to do it down in the deep.  But no one pays attention to the New York fish throwers.  It's the Seattle fish throwers.  They're number one in fish throwing.  I've never heard of it.  Why?  What, do they got a good minor league system?  What's going on?  Yeah, they're the pros.  They've got a good farm system.  I like this kid.  He goes from the Dominican Republic.  He's a left-hander.  Beautiful.  See him throw fish.  Kind of ridiculous, no? 
[01:10:30]  I think it's ridiculous they get involved.  I think the whole thing is ridiculous, throwing a fish.  You know, people clamor and take pictures of it.  It's silly.  But for Peter to get involved, it's already dead.  Stop it.  Stop it.  That's like a human rights organization going to a cemetery and saying,  this is horrible, they're buried underground.  It's like, no, they're dead.  No.  It's like if they were propping the bodies up and karate kicking them back to each other,  like tossing them around.  Like, you ever see in Escape from New York, how they throw the fucking, the old guy, 
[01:11:00]  they push them back and forth.  If they were doing that with the bodies while people clapped, then there would be a human  rights violation.  But it's a person.  Yeah.  So that is different.  This is such a low, I know, I was just trying to, I was just trying to say that once it's  dead, it doesn't matter what you're doing with it, it just seems silly.  Now, a human's a different story because, you know, it's people.  But even, you know, you see what they do there in Afghanistan with that goat?  They throw it around, have a little football game with a dead goat. 
[01:11:30]  See, that's rough.  It's one of their traditions.  No worries.  Don't they have a nice tradition, like being nice to women?  Yeah, that's a good tradition.  Try that one.  How about that?  What country has the tradition where, I think it's a goat, they kind of just throw out a  window, a live?  Yeah, yeah, a live goat for good luck.  Or something.  And just heave it out the window or slice its throat or something.  We're supposed to get along with the world.  Yeah, yeah.  People want us to get along with the world.  We can relate to that.  Well, maybe when they calm down some of their fucking weird traditions, then we're willing  to talk to you. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  Do you think the goat's all psyched to be brought up into the house?  Yeah, he's like, this is going to be great.  Chewing.  Looking at you with those weird fucking eyes.  They're finally going to give me a view.  Yeah.  I'm more special than the other goats.  I'm glad I was so nice.  Then the knife comes out and you see the window open and you're like, oh boy, why didn't  I see this coming?  Thomas Overbeck from Dallas.  Stupid dead fish flying around.  Hey, I'm the king of the flying dead fish.  No way.  No way.  No how.  Flying dead fish. 
[01:12:30]  Oh man, we just, God, some of you guys got to hang on.  See some great calls and we can't get to you in time.  Supposedly, maybe someone can help us out here.  PETA doesn't want the killing of seals in video games anymore.  What video games have them?  What video game has that?  I was going to say, I didn't think that was a big one.  I'm sure there's a video game out there that does that.  Club and Seals?  And PETA had a problem with that.  No way.  No way, no how.  Wow.  Club and Seals.  Fuck you. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  Three, two, four, one.  Doesn't even agree with counting properly.  What did he say?  Six, five, four, three, two, one.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Bullshit.  Oh, that's what it was.  Bullshit.  Danny DeVito, you want in?  They think fish look scared because they just always have that big eye thing.  That's exactly it.  They're like, ah!  You're a fish.  You ever go fishing?  I used to.  And have to rip that fucking hook out of its mouth because it got tangled in there? 
[01:13:30]  Needlenose pliers.  You just get down in the throat.  Oh, you try, man.  Sometimes.  You get down in the throat, you grab that hook, and then it makes a crunching noise when you pull it out.  Mm-hmm.  The thing is still going around.  Fishing.  I mean, my father whapping sea robins over the head with a wrench.  Like, he'd pull it in the boat.  Some of the most horrific things I remember happened in that boat.  Uh-oh.  Just, well, no, not like that.  But we go fishing for Flounder out of Long Island Sound in a little rickety rowboat that we take out of Northport. 
[01:14:00]  Me, my brother, and my dad.  Having a day out.  And, of course, you know, half the boat is weighed down with fucking Schlitz or Schaefer beer.  What did you do that day where it went horribly wrong in your dad's eyes?  Well, one time, of course, I was getting seasick, and I was crying my eyes out that I was feeling sick.  And my father told me to shut up and eat something, so I just was throwing up. 
[01:14:30]  So I had to lay down.  And it was a wooden rowboat.  You can't lay down in a rowboat.  So I laid down in the rowboat.  That just makes you sicker.  He was using crabs as bait, and they got out, and I woke up, and crabs were crawling in my hair.  That's like crazy hair of yours?  Yeah, and the crazy wild hair I had.  And then we were fishing, and he caught a sea robin.  These things are like just the scourge of the sound.  When you're fishing for something, you want Flounder or something like that, and you hook a sea robin. 
[01:15:00]  It's useless.  What is it?  They're spiky, like, things, and they kind of fly out of the water a little and then back in.  They're disgusting-looking.  You can't really eat them.  It's a horrible-looking fish.  Yeah.  So my father would pull him in, and then before he even took the hook out, he would just lay it down there  and take a wrench that he had to use to, like, get the motor started and just wham-wham it over the head.  And blood is flying everywhere.  He'd be able to pry the hook out of the pulp that was its head and throw it back in, and I'm just like, eh. 
[01:15:30]  Would he be annoyed at this?  Man up.  He'd be pissed off.  He'd be goddamn another fucking sea robin.  He's got a tarry tin sticking out of his mouth.  Son of a bitch, another fucking sea robin.  Bam, bam, bam.  I'm sure he was imagining my mom as he's bashing that fucking fish head in.  Your dad was an animal.  Oh, just a wild, miserable guy when he was in New York.  That's animalistic.  Once he went to California, he was, you know, all happy he became a cowboy.  He was like a kid. 
[01:16:00]  He wanted to be a cowboy.  Every once in a while, you get one of those flat fishes.  The flounder.  The flounder.  Where the eye migrates through to the other side.  Right.  And they look all stupid, because their fucking side is fish belly white, because they're  on the ground, or on the sea floor, and then the top is fish color, and they got two eyes  on one side of their head.  Dumb fish.  Stupid fish.  They're born with eyes on both sides of their head, by the way.  And then what?  It migrates to the other side?  The eye migrates right through the head, and comes out the other side. 
[01:16:30]  Why?  How do they see the one way?  I don't know!  We've got to kill them.  That's a flounder.  Look.  We've got to kill all flounders.  That's the top of a flounder, and they just lay on the bottom.  But when they're born, they swim regular for a little while, until the eye migrates through  their head, and they look all silly.  Does that flounder look like regular?  They're pretty tasty, aren't they, flounder?  They're delicious!  I like eating them just for the halibut.  Ah, see, because...  Ah, because they're from that family, I believe.  Ugh.  Really?  I think they are. 
[01:17:00]  No.  Something like that?  No?  No.  I'd like to beat you with a nurse shark for that joke.  Maybe if I didn't say dirt shark.  I'm a fucking douche.  No, that's not true, Ant.  My brother's a marine biologist.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I thought a halibut was...  Let me see a halibut.  You might be right.  Is that a halibut?  You might be right, but I just feel like saying that you're not right, because...  Oh, okay, because your brother's a marine biologist, and you should know.  Yeah, not that I got the knowledge right there.  Let's see a halibut.  They sure look like a flounder.  See? 
[01:17:30]  Two eyes.  Side of the head.  Holy shit.  Yeah, they kind of do look like a...  Let me go to Scott in Ohio so we don't lose this, because we got the video game, as far  as the baby seal thing goes.  Hey, Scott.  Morning.  There's a game coming out.  It's called Overlord 2, and in the demo that you can download on PS3, you basically send  your little demons out, and they beat and eat baby seals.  Wow.  That sounds like a cool game.  That's a game, I think, trying to get a little publicity with a little controversy. 
[01:18:00]  They're kind of smart.  You know how many video games come out these days?  I know.  You've got to stand out.  You do.  You're beating baby seals.  Like, boys, punch it out.  By the way, my Tiger Woods golf game came in the mail yesterday.  Oh!  Life is over as I know it for the next six months.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah?  I couldn't play, though.  What happened?  Is there anything worse than getting a video game, and it's right there, waiting to be played,  and you can't, because you've got too much shit going on in your life?  That is crazy.  Cancer.  Cancer.  You should have anything worse.  That's worse.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[01:18:30]  Fuck it.  Oh, yeah.  Look at him beating the baby seals.  I can throw it in the PS3 yesterday.  Were you annoyed?  I'm losing my...  Yes!  Losing my mind.  Just sitting there, ready.  Ready to go.  I've been waiting for this for months.  Why don't you sit down and play for 10 minutes?  You could.  Just do that.  No.  See, I was smart.  10 minutes leads into 10 hours.  True.  Like that.  Especially a new game.  Oh, yeah.  Horrible.  I got a new game yesterday myself.  I picked up that Pacific Battle fucking Stations game. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, you were just talking about that.  Battle Stations Pacific.  Picked that up.  Had to get a joystick, which I haven't had in quite a while.  For the computer?  Yeah.  Right?  Because you're more a PC gamer, right?  Yeah, yeah.  PC.  But I've been playing first-person shooters and stuff.  Haven't needed a joystick for a while.  So, picked one of those up and fell right back into it.  Nice flying Corsairs, shooting shit, killing japs.  How are the graphics?  Fucking kick ass, bro.  Kick ass.  See, the one problem I have with Tiger Woods, they, I mean, they, the graphics get a little 
[01:19:30]  better every year, but they're way behind.  Yeah.  When you look at that John Madden shit, what the fuck is up with the John Madden graphics?  And they can't do that with a simple game like Tiger Woods.  Yeah.  I mean, the graphics are good on, you know, Tiger Woods.  Don't get me wrong, but it doesn't compare to what Madden's up to.  No.  The Madden thing looks real now.  You're controlling real players.  I know.  They really do.  They, they, they move, even after the plays, they're moving around.  Like, look at that.  That's a shot from Madden. 
[01:20:00]  The coach is talking to the guy.  It's snowing.  It's just ridiculous.  It's hysterical.  You play Madden ever?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Yeah, I play Madden.  I never understood how you control so many players.  Well, you don't.  You just, you, you basically pick what play you want, and then you have the option to control  one person in that, in that play.  Oh, okay.  In that play.  And you can switch around once the play starts.  Ah.  You know, so basically, and like, you know, what you could do is like, let's say you're  a lineman or whatever.  Yeah.  And it's a pass play.  You can then hit a button to change your character to closest to the ball. 
[01:20:30]  So then you could be a wide receiver, run out, try to, you know.  Oh, I got you.  Can you be quarterback?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How do you throw?  Well, different buttons do different things.  What do you throw to?  Your receivers.  If they're not open.  Well, you're screwed.  Then you better, you better tuck it and run.  That's right.  Can you hurt your knees?  Yeah.  If you get tackled bad?  Oh, yeah.  Sure, there's injuries.  Yeah.  Do you have an option where you could do that fag quarterback thing where they slide down  and go, don't hurt me? 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  All that stuff.  Wow, that's pretty cool.  The game's ridiculous.  I'm not a big fan of Madden, but when I do play it, I'm like, right on.  I'm not a big fan of football.  I could kill a couple hours.  But I could play Madden.  I don't understand.  That sounds pretty cool.  I don't think I've ever played a sports game, aside from fighting games, things like that.  The UFC game is great.  I love the hockey game for the PS3, but basketball, and I'm a basketball fan.  I haven't played the last few, but that's so fucking hard. 
[01:21:30]  I don't remember.  Do you remember how ridiculous that was?  It was just two guys bouncing around the court.  Yep.  Doink, doink, doink, doink, doink, doink.  Bloop, bloop, bloop.  And the ball, doink, doink, doink, doink, doink.  No way to aim.  The ball pretty much.  Look at the graph.  Ah!  Danny just punched up the graphic.  That is killer.  The ball pretty much went in every single time you shot.  Yeah.  As long as the defender, the other guy you're playing against wasn't close to you, you're  going to score every time.  It used the amazing graphics of the Pong engine. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, I see that.  You know what, though?  We've done this break many times, but when that came out, you're like, wow, I don't know  how video games are ever going to get better than this.  It's not going to get better than this.  This is amazing.  And look at the cover.  The cover of the old Atari games were so misleading.  It is showing people, like, reverse slam dunking over the back of their head.  Guys, like, pushing around, defending.  Dribbling.  Yeah.  And then you get the game, and you pop it in, and it's bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop. 
[01:22:30]  Right.  Bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop.  The cover looks like some gorgeous painting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's action going on.  Lots of action.  Like, what's his name?  Who used to do those weird, like, psychedelic paintings.  Oh, yeah.  Did the painting of Rocky.  Nishman?  Uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah.  What?  Norman Rockwell?  No, no, no.  No.  The guy with the mustache.  Bob Ross.  No.  Fred Goldman?  See, this is where the age difference, Dan.  Wow.  Leroy Neiman. 
[01:23:00]  Thank you, Andy.  Yes.  Good old Leroy Neiman.  Leroy Neiman.  It looked like a Leroy Neiman painting.  Right.  On the front.  And then you get the graphics, and you're just like, this sucks.  Go ahead and talk about false advertising.  That was like flight simulator.  Microsoft Flight Simulator, the first one, was, um, the cover was, you know, you're flying  a plane.  This is fantastic.  And then you look out the fucking window of the plane, and it's like, meh.  You see, one line is a horizon, and then a meh sound. 
[01:23:30]  That's all you heard.  It sucked.  Uh, let me go.  And that's even a, that was the cover, wasn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah, the cover.  Oh, back to the dude picture.  That's the cover.  Now, it looks like, wow.  That's pretty cool.  That's kind of cool for the time.  Sure, right.  You know?  And then you got there.  All you got were a couple of primitive gauges and a flat line horizon.  Now they look amazing.  Let me go to CJ in Georgia.  CJ.  Good evening.  Hey, CJ. 
[01:24:00]  What the fuck is that?  Flight simulator 2, I think.  Look at it.  That was like, look at the frame rate.  Hold on, CJ.  That's the runway.  Are there any mountains in the back?  Yeah.  Those are the worst mountains I've ever seen.  It's on a grid.  It's just horrible.  What was the first video game you played?  Good question.  I remember one in school.  Console or home?  Any.  Oh, oh, any.  First computer game I ever played?  I want to see if we have the same.  Lunar Lander?  There you go.  God damn it.  And it was a printout thing. 
[01:24:30]  It was.  I was at a keyboard in this giant room.  It was like the ENIAC computer in there.  And it would go, and you read the printout, and it said your altitude, your descending  speed of your lunar lander.  And it would.  And the key was, you had to slow down the spaceship so it doesn't crash on the moon.  But as you slowed it down, that would suck up more gas.  And if you ran out of gas, then it would really crash.  Right, right.  And that was the whole game.  That was. 
[01:25:00]  That's all.  And I got, no one could do it, and I got so excited because at one point it said to  me, it goes, congratulations, you have landed on the moon.  And I'm like, yes.  And it said, you have left a crater one mile wide and half a mile deep.  And I'm like, that is very nice.  I think I saw a graphic, though, when I played it.  I don't think it was just.  No, see that, like that's the one that Danny's playing.  No, I never played that one.  It's like a little gravity one.  No, no, no.  No, mine was all on paper.  It just would print out.  CJ. 
[01:25:30]  All right, hey, you've got to find time to play this Tiger Woods game.  Have you played any of the other ones for 360?  I'm a PS3 guy.  Oh, well, it's the same thing.  It has become a completely different game.  They've changed the putting system around.  And every time you do like a Tiger Challenge, you get to actually see Tiger do exclusive interviews  on like, you know, when he was in the tournaments and what he was thinking and shit.  It's awesome, man.  Yeah, I heard with the Tiger Challenges this time around.  It's actual shots from, you know, the PGA.  Like, amazing shots that you have to now reenact. 
[01:26:00]  It's gone from Tiger Challenges to Tournament Challenges.  I mean, before you were playing professional golfers that couldn't hit the ball 240 yards.  So it was kind of unrealistic.  Tiger Challenges, his wife taking him home and explaining to the parents.  Oh, and by the way, the first game I ever played, Antwerp probably liked this.  It was on an old Mac computer.  And you were playing a soldier in a turret, shooting other soldiers that were storming the beach.  Oh, yeah, that's pretty good.  What year? 
[01:26:30]  All right, punch it out.  Sounds like shit.  Yeah.  I bet it sucked.  I bet the box looked great.  Let's say hi to Vinny in Jersey.  Vinny.  Hey, yeah.  Hey.  PETA actually did an online thing with World of Warcraft, where they had people come in  their special room and kill hordes of seal killers that they created for World of Warcraft.  Oh, really?  It was gay.  It was gay.  I don't think the World of Warcraft world was too happy about it. 
[01:27:00]  They weren't into them taking over their game and doing stupid things like that.  But don't you think, like, Peter should stay away from our fantasy worlds?  Like, meaning video games and all that?  Get out.  Yeah, they should have horses being eaten in Mexico and shit.  Yeah, deal with the real issues and leave our fantasy shit alone.  You're not going to play it and then all of a sudden go to, you know, Alaska or something  and start clubbing seals.  I love killing whores in GTA.  It's fantastic.  But I had no desire to do that in real life.  Not even an inkling. 
[01:27:30]  Well, maybe a little.  Their idea of fun is not my idea of fun.  It's like, oh, look, the dog rescue.  You've got to walk in and unleash a dog who's being mistreated.  And they go, roof-a, roof-a, roof-a, and it jumps in your truck.  Ruff-a, roof-a, roof-a.  Awful.  I think they're working on that game for Nintendo DS.  You could raise, can't you have a pet?  Oh, yeah, they have those stupid pet things where you've got to feed them.  I think Iraq is a fan of that or his girl is.  It's a game where you've got to take care of your pet on Nintendo DS or something. 
[01:28:00]  Mousy.  Nintendogs.  There it is, Nintendogs.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Yeah, the Nintendo DS game, one of them is called Nintendogs, but I'm on that another day.  Um, a peta will never stop.  They've done it before.  They've done it also with, uh, Call of Duty World at War.  Um, you would be able to release these ravenish dogs on your own face.  Yes.  Dogs that want to kill you.  I hate those dogs.  And PETA had this whole thing about, oh, you can't kill these dogs that are trying to kill you.  Really?  It's a video game.  Come on.  Get over it.  You know what sucks about that, uh, the dog option in that game? 
[01:28:30]  And the dogs can kill you faster than a guy with a machine gun.  Yeah.  Like, the dog bites you twice and you're dead.  Uh, the worst part is when all the dogs will kill you and he can unleash even more dogs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Unleash dogs.  It's great.  Jimmy, when you come into Birmingham to do a show?  To where?  To the Tiger Channel.  Alabama.  Oh, actually.  Oh, my God.  My goal, I want to have my agent line up a bunch of, uh, cities I've never been to.  That's my goal.  Oh, I have to come to the South.  Yeah, I love you.  Can't wait for you to come out here.  Thank you. 
[01:29:00]  I'd like to go to Birmingham, Alabama.  I'd like to go to Oklahoma.  A couple of weird places I've just never been to.  That's a great idea.  It's nice out here.  It's not like what you think.  It's really nice.  But don't spread the word because too many northerners will come out here.  All right, Mousy.  Thank you.  Bye, Mousy.  All right.  Punch it out.  Peace.  Mousy.  Uh, the show's going to get really busy because we got Jimmy Fallon calling in to pump up our  appearance on his show tonight.  Yeah.  And we got David Tell stopping by.  Ooh.  Yeah.  I saw him here, uh, yesterday.  Yeah.  He could have just done both shows yesterday.  Maybe he had, uh...  It's all good.  Whatever.  Dave's an alcoholic.  He's lucky he's awake. 
[01:29:30]  What is, uh, what's it tell promoting?  Uh, is he at Caroline's?  I'm not sure.  I don't have to put you in front of me right now.  Danny DeVito, let's, uh, squeeze this in.  Yes, please.  Danny DeVito on local Philly news from the set of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.  Uh, drunk and drinking beer at eight in the morning.  A little taste of, uh, his appearance.  LBG, little baby girl.  We are talking about LBG, little baby girl.  Remember we had the tummy off?  Yeah, yeah.  You were drunk on the lemon chill.  Yeah, I remember.  You might not remember.  I remember you had the belly, and I was thinking about what that would look like when that 
[01:30:00]  kid was born.  And, uh, she's cute.  Is she cute?  Was she cute coming out, like, you know?  Yeah, uh-huh, of course.  You get the picture of the legs and the head coming out, like...  That's enough of that.  That's enough of that.  Now, you guys are here in the Overbrook section.  You know I love you, right?  Yeah, I love you.  I had to worry about extra high shoes, because you're the only man I can look down to.  Well, that's good.  At three feet tall.  You wore that short skirt.  I sure did, Danny.  She's really nice.  Okay, here's the thing.  Easy access.  Oh, wow.  Good for Danny.  What did he say?  Easy access.  That mean easy access. 
[01:30:30]  Why did she have to be taller than Danny DeVito?  She was getting a little upset about what Danny DeVito was saying.  About the birth of her child?  Yeah, she threw the short remark at him.  And Danny DeVito comes right back.  I, by the way, absolutely believe this drunk Danny DeVito stuff is all a scam.  I believe it's a work.  I think the first time when he was on The View, it was a work, because let me tell you something.  He brought up the fact that him and George Clooney were drinking that limoncello stuff all night, 
[01:31:00]  and that's why he was drunk.  And he mentioned it again.  He puts out this stuff called Danny DeVito's limoncello.  It's like a business he has.  So he's promoting it.  I don't think he's drunk.  I think he does this when he does these interviews to get attention.  Smart.  I think there's probably water in that beer can or something.  And he just makes like he's drunk so he can be outrageous and say these things.  I don't think he's really drunk. 
[01:31:30]  It allows you to say some crazy stuff.  See, Danny DeVito limoncello.  There it is.  How else are you going to get the word out for that?  Yeah.  For that.  And he mentioned it so many times on The View that he was drinking it.  I even heard of it now.  Yeah.  Because of that.  Yeah.  Not because he would have plugged it just normally on The View.  I would have forgot by the end of the day.  I smell work.  I kind of like your thought.  It's a work.  Here we go.  Well, he belches.  It's real.  He's belching.  He's belching.  What's work? 
[01:32:00]  We're trying to keep it clean.  We're classy fellows.  He's drinking.  Yeah.  What time is it?  Philadelphia's just waking up, right?  We're trying to, you know, get, we don't, no, come on, man.  They're trying, they're having their breakfast.  Yeah.  Oh, you know, it's not real beer.  No, of course not.  It smells like real beer.  You're filming a scene for the hit Fox show.  It's always sunny in Philadelphia.  Look at that.  The sun's out.  Look at that.  It's sunny.  We had Armageddon storms yesterday, but today we brought the sun out.  Thank you.  You're here in the Overbrook section, and I have to tell you, coming around the traffic,  you would never even know that you guys are back here in this neighborhood. 
[01:32:30]  You're basically behind St. Joe's.  We're tucked away.  Yes.  Nobody will see us.  You've been filming all week in the city.  We can do anything we want.  You are so naughty.  You'll never.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  Nobody will ever find out.  Now, listen, is it hard filming with him?  Yeah, you're looking at it.  I don't know if that's a work, dude.  I think it's a work.  I don't see him.  He's on the set drinking beer at 8 in the morning.  Yeah, he's on the set drinking beer.  Just stop.  It's so unprofessional.  Right.  No one would put up with that.  Danny DeVito is a successful guy. 
[01:33:00]  He probably drinks his face off when the day's done.  Yeah, but Danny DeVito liked this show and said, could you write me into it?  He is by far the reason this show is out.  He's a huge star on the show.  He can just do what he wants.  Yeah, but I don't think he would want to drink beer at 8 in the morning on camera like this.  It's a very unprofessional thing to do for somebody that's that successful and apparently responsible.  He owns businesses.  He's a director.  He's done some very good work. 
[01:33:30]  Acting lessons.  Dancing lessons.  I don't know.  I just, I just, I'm not buying it.  Not buying the whole act.  You know that John Wayne would have been 102 today?  Who?  Casey?  Dude, can we hear the letterman audio too?  I haven't heard that.  No, no, no.  No, we can't.  You want to feel old?  All right.  Jurassic Park.  We were just mentioning Jurassic Park two days ago because of the land of the lost. 
[01:34:00]  I mentioned it.  You did, Jimmy.  How many years ago?  Goddamn, they're probably on their 15th anniversary.  Oh, you saw that somewhere?  No.  35?  I did the math.  16 fucking years ago?  16?  That movie came out?  16 years ago?  For real?  Well, CGI still looks good.  What would that be?  Except for the real far shots of the big dinosaurs.  Yeah, I remember because I was not yet in radio.  I was still knocking tin.  And I went to the movies two days in a row to the theater to see that because it was just 
[01:34:30]  that amazing.  So you went back the next day?  Next day, went back to Walt Whitman Mall where the movie theater was right next to the mall.  You just wanted to see the fucking daughter.  That's the only reason you went back?  Exactly.  Please.  What's she look like now?  She's got a granddaughter, by the way.  Was she?  Yeah.  She was the granddaughter of the, yeah.  Of the guy.  The guy.  Of the guy from The Great Escape.  She made him the daughter.  Then she was technically the daughter of someone. 
[01:35:00]  Eric Stoltz.  No.  Laura Dern was in that, of course.  Jeff Goldblum.  And then there was...  The guy.  That guy.  The guy, Sir fucking...  Sir something.  Newman.  Richard Attenborough.  Richard Attenborough was in The Great Escape.  And he was the head of Jurassic Park.  And it was his grandchildren that were there.  Samuel Jackson.  The boy who is now going to be in the new kind of version of Band of Brothers in the Pacific. 
[01:35:30]  The little boy.  He's the one that's like the lead character in that.  And then the girl who just kind of disappeared.  Ariana Richards.  How the fuck do you know this?  Is that her?  Where'd she go?  How old is she now?  Hang on.  All right.  Let's see some pitches.  She's 16, 30.  30.  So that girl's 30 now.  Wow.  Let's see some pitches.  She'll be 30. 
[01:36:00]  She'll be 30.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Let's see some pitches.  All right.  Is this recent?  It still looks like her.  That's not recent.  No.  No.  That can't be recent.  It's 10 years ago.  It still looks like her because it's 10 years ago.  But 10 years ago.  Look how much older she looked than she was in the movie.  I understand.  But she's like 20 there.  She's with that asshole from fucking that 70s show.  Well, after the break, Jimmy, yes, of course, we're going to do the Letterman thing.  He's all over the news today because of a Sarah Palin joke that was pretty funny. 
[01:36:30]  We got the audio of him explaining the joke from last night's show.  Yeah, she looks all right, Ann, right?  She looks all right.  She looks good.  It's like the mother of the kid from Jurassic Park.  And what time is Fallon calling in?  It's supposed to be 8 o'clock.  Any minute.  That's why I'm trying to go to break.  Oh, boy.  Any minute, Jimmy.  But we got to take our leaks.  I think after the break, we'll have Jimmy Fallon on the show.  All righty. 
[01:37:00]  Dave Vittell, who is promoting Caroline's Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  The shows will sell out if they're not already.  So just call the great Dave Vittell.  And then the Letterman controversy, too.  So still lots to do today.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  You heard it in there.  We're going to be on Jimmy Fallon tonight.  We can't be more excited than we are right now, right?  Yes.  And on the phone,  Jimmy Fallon.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  What's up, Jimmy?  How are you, buddy?  Thanks for having me on, man.  I'll see you in a couple hours.  Are you kidding? 
[01:37:30]  Thanks for having us on.  Yeah, thanks for having us on.  Look at that mutual ass kissing we're doing here.  That's great.  I never thought I'd see the day because I've been to a couple of Jimmy Fallon tapings.  And if you go through your archives, you'll see me in your audience with a hoodie on looking  very creepy because I didn't want to be involved with the pom-pom bit you guys were doing that  night.  That's a true story.  It was when the March Madness was happening and you guys decided to root for the Mox.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They were the 16th Seed, yeah. 
[01:38:00]  And it was a good bit, but I went to the tape and I saw these pom-poms at my feet.  I'm like, oh, no.  No fucking way, man.  So if you look at the tape, you'll see me just slumping down in my chair hoping no one  recognizes that I'm not doing the pom-pom bit.  Isn't it amazing when you're trying not to be called on like you're in school, but you're  in your 40s?  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  And there's only like 50 seats.  It's like, hey, is the Unabomber in the crowd?  I was one seat away from having to hold up like a card because you guys were spelling 
[01:38:30]  We tried to make a college rally.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Wow.  In our, what do you call it, in our little studio.  That would have been screen-capped, though.  It was screen-capped.  I think I put it on my Twitter, actually.  But, man, you know what?  Been to a couple tapings.  I'm loving the show, Jimmy.  Loving it.  Thanks so much.  I appreciate it.  I mean, I'm getting better as the girls are going on.  I mean, now I'm kind of coming into my own.  I'm more relaxed.  I mean, I didn't know how to host a talk show. 
[01:39:00]  I mean, you know, it's all new for me.  So we're 62 shows in now.  It kind of feels like home to me, and I feel really loose and comfortable, and it's like  we're getting, you know, the crowds are great, and we're getting great guests, and thank you  guys for coming on tonight.  It's going to be awesome.  Yeah, what are we going to talk about?  Because we're really nervous.  Oh, my God.  That's what he wants to hear, right?  We just give one-word answers.  Yeah, we're really good at one-word answers, so you better have 50 questions.  Isn't that the worst?  When people just go, yes. 
[01:39:30]  If you just come on, yeah, and just say one word.  By the way, it's happened to me a thousand times.  Oh, it is the worst.  You know, and you have pre-interviews, and you talk to people before they come on.  They go, I got this great story about how it was water skiing, and then I end up saving  some kid's life, and then they come on the air, and you go, so did you have a crazy experience  with water skiing?  And they go, no, not really.  No, not really?  No.  I mean, I saw a kid drown, but he's okay. 
[01:40:00]  Everything's okay now.  Next.  Oh, my God.  My God, I was hoping for about five minutes there.  Yeah, in your mind, that was supposed to eat up five, seven minutes.  Oh, my God.  Now what?  Yeah, and when that doesn't happen, those minutes crawl by, but tonight we're going to  have a blast.  It'll be good.  We have Betty White.  Yeah, she's quite the card, isn't she?  Oh, I'm excited about Betty White.  Oh, she is.  She's a wild one.  You know?  Yeah.  Yeah, she's good.  She's going to be good, and then...  Well, can I slow you down with the Betty White thing?  You do that bit about licking stuff.  Can we lick Betty White tonight?  Jesus Christ. 
[01:40:30]  I mean, you want to lick Betty White?  Would she allow us to lick her?  She probably would.  Lick her hand.  Like, when you shake it, just lick the back of her hand.  That's actually respect.  I mean, yeah, you can just do it backstage when you say hi to her.  Well, I was...  You know, I mean, I was...  Well, we could do that.  I mean, I was thinking, too, because I'm going to challenge Betty White to beer pong.  Wow.  For real?  Nice.  And I don't know if you guys play beer pong, but if you want, maybe me and Betty White  could team up against you guys.  Yeah, we could do that.  That'd be good.  I love beer pong.  Really?  Oh, of course.  Yeah.  Who doesn't play beer pong?  I love that. 
[01:41:00]  It is pretty sick, though.  Like, when you play beer pong and the ping pong ball goes under the refrigerator at someone's  house and they dig it out and now it lands in the beer and you drink it anyway.  Yeah, of course.  It's an easy way to get twine flute.  Yeah, it's just...  I don't know why you drink the beer with garbage floating in it, but only for beer pong.  Because beer kills everything.  And then you have that cup, like the wash-off cup.  That's the dirtiest cup in the world.  Yeah.  You're just dipping a ping pong in water and you go, hey, it's clean.  Yeah, now it's clean.  It's like, who? 
[01:41:30]  Who thought these were?  My grandma?  You could only play that drunk.  You wouldn't drink that crap sober.  I would see that.  My grandma would cook stuff in the kitchen and something would fall on the floor.  She'd pick it up and, like, bless it to heaven or something and then feed it to me.  Yeah, yeah.  They do that, like, five-second rule.  If you drop it and you pick it up within five seconds, it's okay.  But you're so right.  It's all these ping pong balls.  Strangers are grabbing it with their fingers, throwing it, and you're just drinking the beer  that the ball's landing in.  Yeah, you don't know the people.  Usually it's over at someone's house.  You go to some stupid party and it's like, oh, what's going on in here? 
[01:42:00]  Oh, beer pong, man.  All right.  I'm in.  And some guy's, like, picking his nose or his ass and he's picking up the ping pong  ball and you're drinking the beer that the ball is floating in.  Hey, can I spit the beer in your mouth?  Yeah, yeah, sure, man.  It's beer pong.  What am I doing?  It's cool.  He just finger popped his girlfriend upstairs and then it was his turn at the...  Don't worry.  We won't use that one on your show tonight, Jimmy.  We understand the TV's a little different.  I don't know if you can do that or not, yeah.  Yeah, right.  It's an interesting one.  We should try to test the limits.  We could work out our appearance right now.  I mean, what do you want to talk about tonight? 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, right.  Well, you guys can do two songs off the new album.  Yeah, right.  That's what we figured we would do.  Well, our pre-interview was great.  We don't get to talk to you, but we get to talk to someone that sounded a lot like you.  He did.  I was going to say that.  You noticed that?  I'm like, does Jimmy Fallon do his own pre-interview?  I'm starting to think, wait a minute.  I think this might be Jimmy.  It was Rob who we know over there.  Oh, I love that dude.  And now we're like, we did an hour on the phone.  It went really well.  But now we're wondering which of those things we're going to use.  Any of them.  Who cares?  Run the gamut. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  I mean, yeah, we'll have fun.  Honestly, we'll make it fun and easy.  And just know that, please, you have an open-ended invitation.  You can come today.  You can come next week.  So, I mean, just be...  Every day.  Every day.  How uncomfortable would it be if these two psychos just showed up once a week?  That would be horrible.  Hey, look, we're doing an appearance.  Can you plug it?  Oh, God.  Just turn into whores.  And we're savvy, because we had a really good Letterman appearance.  And remember, they came right up to our dressing room.  We want to book you immediately for like three months from now. 
[01:43:30]  We've never been back to David Letterman, Jimmy.  Yeah, right?  But they were so gung-ho, like, oh, we've got to book that next appearance now.  Well, I can tell you right now, whenever you guys want to go, honestly, I'm a huge fan.  And you guys can afford to me.  We'll see how the first one goes.  The show is working and all that stuff.  Jimmy, I've got a great skydiving story.  For real.  What?  Yeah.  You're going to tell that tonight?  Yeah, ask me about it.  Yeah.  All right.  I've never gone skydiving.  I'm afraid.  I'm setting you up.  I'm setting you up, Jimmy.  He's still setting you up. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, I know.  I told you.  He would just be like, no, I've never gone skydiving.  I've never gone skydiving.  I'm not stupid.  We should do that anyway, just for your fans.  Just for a side joke.  Hey, is there a music guest tonight?  Yeah, we have Martha Wainwright.  She's going to sing Edith Piaf song.  Very cool.  It's going to be really awesome.  She's like, rocks, knocks it out of the park.  Even if you don't know French, she just sings it so good.  French.  It's just, it's a really, I don't know if you saw La Vie en Rose or that movie, but it's 
[01:44:30]  going to be amazing.  Cool.  She's sick.  And she's, yeah, it's going to be a good show.  You know, what I liked about your tapings, the Roots are just amazing.  I didn't know much about the Roots before I went to the taping.  I always heard of the band.  Yeah.  And then I looked them up on YouTube and stuff and, you know, I'm getting into them a little  bit, but it's just amazing what they do.  They're pretty talented.  I mean, they're just, and they're like audiophiles.  They just love music and they just want to do anything, you know, from whatever.  They just want to challenge or just like play anything.  I don't know what they're going to play when you come out. 
[01:45:00]  You know, it's probably, any guesses?  Is there a song called, these guys are a bunch of dicks?  I don't think that's serious.  It must have been a B-side.  Yeah.  I don't know.  No, but they came out, I think it was a tuba.  The guy.  Oh, Damon.  Yeah.  He's on the, yeah.  Yeah.  And he, he turned the tuba into like a hip hop thing.  It's crazy.  How the fuck do you do that?  It's like, dude, I can't see you in 50 years playing that.  No, no, no.  It's like, he's going to be crushed. 
[01:45:30]  I mean, it weighs 50 pounds.  Yeah.  He's dancing around like it's nothing.  It's so exciting when it comes to the show.  I think, you know, even if, even if I'm like, eh, the roots are phenomenal.  Yeah.  They get you pumped up.  They get you pumped up.  It's like, oh man.  So it's, they're so excited and it's just like, they, they love playing.  And like, like, uh, we had Paul Simon on last week and, and they jumped at, they sang late  in the evening with Paul Simon.  Oh, wow.  Very cool.  It was so good.  It was like, and we had Andrew Ballas with these, this horn section from Brooklyn and they  were just, it blew it away. 
[01:46:00]  It was the best version I've ever heard.  It was so much fun.  Like people just couldn't, it was just, we're so rocking.  That's very cool.  Can we use your guest booker?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You get some really good guests.  Yeah.  You really do.  We got good bookers.  Yeah.  I mean, we got some good guests coming up.  We got, uh, Sonic Youth is coming on.  Oh, wow.  Iggy Pop, Tiger Woods.  Yeah.  Cameron Diaz coming back.  When's Tiger in?  Tiger's coming on the 25th.  Oh, wow.  That's a good one.  Jimmy, if you could get me an autographed Tiger Award golf ball, I will, I'm yours forever. 
[01:46:30]  How's he going to sign something so small?  I know.  They do it though.  I don't know.  You know what's weird?  Like with all the dimples on the ball, I could sign it.  Yeah.  T-W.  Here, I'll put it.  It would look like a real legible autograph.  I know.  That would look really bad.  Good point.  Yay.  The one thing I want to mention, we mentioned it in the interview yesterday, we're all Twitter  guys.  And what I appreciate about you is you're still tweeting like crazy.  I thought now that, you know, you found your legs and the show is very successful, you  would have faded out of that whole thing.  But you're still keeping everyone, all your followers right there with you. 
[01:47:00]  I think that's cool.  Oh, you're a good man.  You know what?  I never, I don't think I ever followed you guys because I don't think, Anthony, were you  ever on Twitter?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm on there.  I don't pump it as much as Opie pumps his.  Yeah, we do different things.  I'll tell you the truth.  Yeah.  Send me tweets now, then I'll start following you guys.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  Do that.  Are you kidding me?  You're Jimmy Fallon?  At Jimmy Fallon, my friend.  Yeah.  It's fun.  It's just, I don't know what it is.  It's an ego thing.  Like, people need to hear more of me. 
[01:47:30]  Give me a break.  But it's like, you just type in something, you're like, hey, I think this is cool, or  check out this, or, you know, we're doing this in the show, or, you know, I don't send  out that many.  I'm the Twitter guy.  I have to Twitter with, or tweet, excuse me, with a picture.  Like, I can't just do text.  No.  It's got to have a picture with it.  At this point, yeah, they're more fun with it.  Yeah.  At this point, I get disappointed if I'm following someone and they don't have a picture.  I'm like, with their update, I'm like, ah.  I don't want to do anything, just reading.  Cooking dinner for the kids.  All right.  All right.  Show what you're cooking. 
[01:48:00]  I don't need a photo, though.  I have interesting, I'll tweet sometimes, like I was at a diner and my eggs were runny,  so I wrote, my eggs are runny, and I put an exclamation point.  And people wrote back, like, wow, that's interesting, what happened.  You're an answer.  Dude, love that.  See, that's a good degree, Owen.  All right.  You could frame that.  Yeah.  Jimmy, because our fans are dicks, the first one that says, ask me about skydiving tonight,  that's me.  Okay, good.  I just tweeted, but now you're going to get about a thousand of those from our, you're  going to see how big our fan base is now.  I hope it gets more than four. 
[01:48:30]  How embarrassing would that be?  Exactly.  Oh, yeah.  Please tweet that now so we look good, guys.  No.  Okay, got it.  But I got it right now, I'm going to follow you now, I'm on my iPhone.  That's right.  But why are you tweeting as Jim Norton at Twitter, Owen?  That's so bizarre.  I don't do that.  I actually follow you, Jimmy.  I don't think I follow any celebrities other than yourself.  You were the first celebrity I started following.  It's not, I mean, thank you, by the way, for doing that.  I don't want, you know, it's like, I don't want to make it the same, like, you know, a 
[01:49:00]  lot of, like, the other celebrity things are like, hey, you got to do this, it's serious,  what's going on, let's break a million, let's do this.  And it's like, I don't, I don't use it for that reason.  Yeah, I just kind of enjoy doing it.  It's just a goofy entertainment thing.  I'm not taking it seriously at all.  I only follow three celebrities, Jimmy Fallon, Chris Cornell, because he was on the show  and he was so cool, I'm like, I got to start following him.  I like it, dude.  And Kevin Smith.  Oh, yeah, I follow Kevin, too.  And I think that's it.  You know who follows me? 
[01:49:30]  Huh?  Oprah.  No.  Really?  Yeah, I'm one of the ten people she follows.  Well, that's pretty cool.  That's got to be nerve-wracking.  And I've got some direct messages from her, like, she sends me DMs on her.  There is some pressure when you look at who follows you.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy, now I've got to be on my game.  I've got to be on my Twitter game.  It would be funny if Oprah started taunting you.  Do you call that interesting?  Started attacking you on your Twitter.  Making fun of you with how much money she makes.  Yeah.  She tweets a photo of herself just in a bundle of cash, shrugging. 
[01:50:00]  We tweet about how different our vacations are.  Yeah.  Jesus.  I'm like, I'm in a hammock.  Yeah.  You're close.  She's in Honolulu in, like, the Four Seasons, and you're in Ron Kankama.  I'm in Lake George.  Yeah, doing some stand-up on your downtime.  I'm doing Bonnaroo this weekend.  Are you?  For real?  Been to Bonnaroo before?  Bonnaroo is this weekend?  I've always wanted to go to Bonnaroo.  I did that last year.  I did sets there.  That's this weekend?  Yeah.  Oh, my God, dude. 
[01:50:30]  How was that, Jim?  Was it fun?  Yeah, it's a little weird.  Do you know if your shows are during the day or at night?  During the day.  It's like you'll get a lot of people who come in just to get out of the sun.  But, I mean, you're different.  No, but I mean, like, they don't even know there's a comedy show.  But I'm sure you'll have them all there to see you.  But they're great.  I mean, they're actually really nice crowds.  There was no aggressiveness.  I was surprised at how good they were.  Wow.  And you're in a tent?  Am I in a tent?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And actually one of the few air-conditioned places.  So the shows are always full, and I enjoyed it. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, good.  Yeah, it's going to be me and Wayne Fetterman.  Okay.  Oh, wow.  We're doing that.  But it's a – and then I think Saturday night is Bruce Springsteen.  Wow.  Springsteen is doing Bonnera this year?  Yeah, Springsteen's Bonnera.  I think Sunday they're closing it out with Fish.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah, Springsteen's Saturday night.  Speaking of your stand-up, I noticed because I follow you on Twitter that on weekends you're  doing stand-up all over the country, or is that just every once in a while?  Yeah, like every other week I do it.  I do like – like this week I'm doing Bonnera, next weekend I have off. 
[01:51:30]  How do you keep up that schedule with the TV show?  I just don't pay attention.  I just like – it's just something I have to do.  I just want to make the show work.  I want to do whatever I can to get out there and just like not listen to anything, just  keep moving, keep moving.  Then a rolling stone gathers no moths, I guess.  Well, it's got to help with the thing, too, because you're out, you're performing.  I mean, obviously, I mean, Letterman was a stand-up, but Leno was such a big stand-up.  It really helps to be able to do that with monologues and all that stuff to keep yourself  fresh if you want to just go out and work on stuff.  Yeah, exactly.  And then it's like – it's also like, you know, you have to do these events now and 
[01:52:00]  then, you know, just because you're on NBC.  Like, some executives, like, you've got to host this thing.  And you go, okay.  And, like, those are the hellest gigs.  Oh, yeah, and really, an executive coming up saying, this is going to be a good one.  You just know it's going to be awful.  This is brutal.  The same guy you have to –  You're in, like, a ballroom in a hotel.  You're like, wow.  Oh, man.  You're eating.  You can hear, like, silverware.  The clinking and clanking of silverware on plates.  And there's waiters walking around, like, serving, talking to people, like, would you like 
[01:52:30]  more coffee?  No, you wouldn't.  Oh, you do.  Do you want to eat that?  And they're having conversations.  And I'm doing my stupid joke about, like, hey, do you guys go to the movies?  Oh, my God.  It's brutal.  But, I mean, there's got to be – I mean, Jim, is there a book written about hell gigs?  There has to be.  I don't know, actually.  There was some comic that wrote something recently.  I've talked about hell gigs in my two bestsellers.  But, I mean, they're not specifically about hell gigs.  I'm sure there's something out there, though.  That would be a great read.  Yeah.  It's, like, the worst gigs ever.  Didn't Seinfeld write a book, actually, about bad gigs? 
[01:53:00]  I think Seinfeld had something to do with a book.  That's familiar.  Like, someone actually did this.  They rejected my story, which is why I actually wrote my own book.  My story was too weird, I think.  What happened in your gig?  It was just – it was a sexual story that involved myself and Bob Levy and Jim Florentine.  Not with each other, but it was just really creepy.  And I think Seinfeld probably looked at it and went, no.  And they just rejected it.  What the deal was that?  Yeah, exactly.  That's what he actually said.  That's weird.  Hey, congratulations on the Webby.  That's pretty big these days. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  Right?  I was really excited about that.  Yeah, I got Webby Person of the Year where you're only allowed to say five words in your acceptance speech.  Really?  Yeah.  So it's tricky for a comedian because you can't go for the laugh, really.  I mean, it's just people have done everything.  Because I think, like, 800 people win these awards every year.  So people have done the thing where, like, I would like to thank – and then walk away and go, oh, boy.  What did you do?  I said – I got up to – Cameron Diaz gave me the award.  And I was all excited. 
[01:54:00]  But then I went up and I said, thank God Conan got promoted.  Wow, five words.  That's a good one.  That's a perfect five words.  But, I mean, I had another one I was going to sing.  I had, like, a boombox.  And I was going to do a whole big thing.  I'm like, I'm not going to swing that hard.  Why work up a sweat?  It's an epic myth.  I can't do it.  But it was pretty fun, man.  It moves fast.  It's like, you know, everyone's just kind of there to just say, like – I don't think they take it that seriously. 
[01:54:30]  They more, like, respect each other.  Like, hey, good job.  Yeah, yeah.  You did good, you did good.  And it's like, just get up, say five words, and leave.  It's pretty fun.  That is a pretty brilliant way to run an award show.  Like, who can say the most interesting five words?  I mean, that's actually a really interesting way to do it.  That's smart.  Yeah, Lorne Michaels had a good one.  He won, like, some lifetime achievement or something like that last year.  And he said, five words are not enough.  Wow, that's great.  I like that one.  And then Stephen Colbert won last year. 
[01:55:00]  And he said, me, me, me, me, me.  And Sarah Silverman, this year, she won.  And she said, I want to say, like, did the Holocaust happen?  Oh, wow.  Wait, that's only four words.  Wait, then she said yes.  Oh, okay.  And then anyway, yes.  At least she answered it.  Yeah, she answered her own question. 
[01:55:30]  But it was like, you know, it's like people go up and they've got to do their own.  You know, you try it.  It's definitely her style.  Were any awful, though?  Like, did any have any that, like, were supposed to be, like, cutting edge?  They just were kind of like, yuck.  Oh, yeah.  There's so many.  There's one that was like, someone said six words.  Oh, you can't do that.  Yeah, it was like, booze.  People booze.  Like, what?  This is a night.  This is an outrage.  I can't say six words.  I'm walking.  I'm walking out.  It was anarchy.  But, yeah, it was just, you know, it's like all the same jokes.  Like, you know, I would like to thank or, you know, I'm going to make this short. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Stuff like that.  But it's like, people have just seen it already.  So, it's like, oh, you kind of feel bad.  Yeah, they should up it to ten words or something because five words just doesn't, you know.  That's tough.  It's good.  I like that.  That's the beauty of it.  Sure.  Or one word.  Speaking of words, when you tweet, do you feel like you have to use all 140 characters?  No, no, no.  I keep, sometimes I run, like, when I first started Twitter, I used to just delete spaces 
[01:56:30]  and just have one run on word.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And that's just obnoxious.  You really do have to edit yourself.  And always put the picture before your text because the link actually takes up some of  the text.  Oh, just so you know how much you've got left.  Yeah, so I've written a whole thing and then posted the picture and, oh, my God, now half  my text is gone.  And I've got to start X-ing off very important words.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, do you guys have the iPhone or no?  Yes.  Of course.  I've got the BlackBerry.  No, iPhone rules.  I know I'm starting to lose the battle. 
[01:57:00]  I'm getting the new iPhone on Wednesday, the 17th.  You're getting it two days early.  On the show.  It's going to be sick.  Damn it.  Is that just because you have a show?  Stupid question, guy.  I love the iPhone, man.  We're going to, I mean, we're going to talk about it on the show and just see.  I don't know if I'm actually going to get one, but I'm just going to hold one.  I can't function without it.  Like, it's now my tricorder, communicator.  It's like everything.  The apps, I barely use it as a phone. 
[01:57:30]  It's just everything else that's on it.  Oh, it doesn't work as a phone.  Yeah, right.  Well, of course, it's, you know, no signal ever.  Yes, terrible phone.  Yeah, but who uses?  It's a great thing.  Yeah, it's a great thing.  But who uses a phone for a phone these days?  When your phone actually rings, doesn't it seem weird now?  Yeah, you go, what the heck is this?  I always do that.  As I'm taking it out of my pocket, I go, who the hell is this?  Yeah, why can't you just text me?  Text.  Email.  Text me, please, I don't have time to talk.  It's all about talking.  What is that?  What do you use?  Do you use Tweety?  Tweety. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  Tweety is the way to go.  Tweety seems to be the best one.  There's a lot of the apps on the iPhone that work better than the actual, if you go on  a full-size computer and go to the site and try to do it.  They kind of, you know, pared it down really nice.  Yeah, so I was going to say, like, you can add the photo and it doesn't take your characters  on Tweety.  Oh, shit.  Maybe we don't use Tweety, then.  Hold on, hold on.  What the hell is this?  Yeah.  Why the hell wasn't I told about this?  Exactly.  What the hell's going on?  I use Tweety.  I use Tweety.  It does eat the little characters, Jimmy. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, it does?  Yeah.  I think so, yeah.  I think so.  I don't know.  Maybe I'm wrong.  You might have the new and improved Tweety, perhaps.  Maybe you got the special celebrity account with Tweety.  Celebrity Tweety.  But as we debate Tweety, like, I want to know how many people are aiming their cars right  now for, like, a bridge or anything.  I have to disagree about your Tweety assessment, Crash.  Where's that abutment?  I couldn't think of that word, so I said bridge.  Yes, of course.  That was good.  Held up by an abutment. 
[01:59:00]  I know.  I'm an idiot.  Hey, Jimmy.  All our listeners are comedy writers.  Oh, yeah.  Good.  Going with that five-word thing.  Somebody came up with the cure for cancer is.  That's great.  Oh, okay.  Huh?  Yeah, there's a cliffhanger, Joe.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cliffhanger.  Yeah, exactly.  That's a pretty good one.  Not bad.  The cure for cancer is.  Is.  And then you realize you're out of words.  Yeah.  And then people would go, okay, look, we'll give you more words.  Please tell us.  And then you don't have it, so.  What were you talking about?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Someone's saying.  You just look silly. 
[01:59:30]  Someone else is saying, great, you guys are wasting all your material, you know, now,  and when it comes to tonight, you're going to have nothing to talk about.  I know.  We'll just rehash the same trap we're doing right now.  Yeah, I'm going to lick Betty White.  Betty White.  I'm doing the lick Betty White bit.  We could do that for 10 minutes.  That would be just.  That would be gross.  I've never seen Betty White interviewed.  I guess she's a great interviewer.  I mean, she's hilarious.  The Golden Girls, and she was on Marisola Moore.  She's not as prim and proper as she comes across on a lot of shows.  Dirty girl, right?  Yeah.  A little edgy?  A lot of the women from that whole era, you know, Cloris Leachman, and they just have 
[02:00:00]  this dirty, filthy side to them.  Really?  Yeah.  Very dirty jokes and things like that.  I can't wait.  It's going to be a fun show tonight, and again, I want to thank you guys for coming on.  It's going to be fun.  Thanks for having us.  And Jim, you've got to come on soon.  Thank you, man.  Who's on tomorrow?  How uncomfortable would it be if I just showed up with my calendar and really started trying  to book through you directly?  Jimmy, come on!  You said, Jimmy.  You said.  I'll call you today.  We'll get a date for you, because I'd love to have you on, please. 
[02:00:30]  Thanks, of course.  I'd love to.  The whole king of comedy thing.  Now, Jimmy, I thought I'd come on the show.  Ma, I'm trying to do this now!  If I have a list of demands like Tiger Woods, and I want the same green room and the same  treatment, you're an ass.  No one knows you.  Yeah, you will.  Yeah, thanks, man.  Jimmy, we'll see you tonight.  See you tonight, because I really appreciate it.  Yeah, absolutely, man.  We're loving it.  We do.  It's going to be fun.  It's going to be fun times.  Well, a blast.  Thank you, Mr. Fallon. 
[02:01:00]  Bye, guys.  Thanks again.  See you tonight, man.  Bye.  Jimmy Fallon, everyone.  It's Jimmy Fallon.  He just works with this show.  Yeah.  He can just go with the flow.  I love that.  And there's someone that's actually, like, they didn't give him the gig, and he's just  kind of sitting there going, all right, let's see how this works.  The guy's out there making this work, you know?  Right.  A lot of guys get fucking lazy.  They just plop him in the seat and, hey, it didn't work.  What do you want from me?  No, he's a hard worker.  He's out there doing, like, comedy and shit. 
[02:01:30]  But I could just imagine these corporate guys coming up and going, yeah, we've got this  great opportunity.  I think it'll be good for the show if you go to this corporate gig that we've got going  on.  Most of the guys we talk to, though, they say the corporate gigs, they hate doing them,  but the money is ridiculous.  Right, Jimmy?  Yeah.  I never get booked at them.  Yeah, you're too filth-riffed.  Hey, Steve, could you?  Our Dave is here, so tell Steve to grab it.  Don't you have a clean set that you can throw at these people?  Nah, I mean, I can do a few minutes on that.  Use your old original set.  Yeah.  With Chunky Monkey. 
[02:02:00]  You know, why don't we do this?  Yeah.  Because David Tell's walking down the hall.  Why don't we do one quick break, Danny?  Take some leaks, reset, so we could, you know, have a solid hour with David Tell next.  Does that sound good?  All righty.  All right, cool.  Let's do that.  Opie and Anthony.  David Tell walks into the studio and begins beating us up.  Of course.  What a little love circle jerk there with Jimmy on the phone with your tweets and our techno babble. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, we were talking about tweeting and Tell was totally disgusted.  We're still in that zone where we're just happy to be here.  What about writing it on a piece of parchment, handing it to a slave and hoping for the best?  What happened in the old days?  Am I right?  You're not a fan of the Twitter or the Facebook or the MySpace?  No.  Do you do any of that stuff there, Dave?  I don't.  You know, I feel like if a man's got something to say, he should just pull out a revolver, 
[02:03:00]  head down to a memorial.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, that guy was a little angry.  I think he meant business, huh?  Do you think he, do you think at the end of the Gran Torino movie, he said, amen, brother.  Thanks for my marching orders.  First Danny Gans, then David Carradine, now this.  Yeah.  Yeah, he had had it.  Danny Gans, autopsy's in.  Painkillers.  Accidental overdose of painkillers.  Painkillers.  Really?  Yeah.  He must have been miserable doing that show in Vegas for so long or something. 
[02:03:30]  Well, but you've got to understand, he did like a million voices.  He had to take extra pills for all the different characters.  Each character that was.  Yeah.  You know, Sammy needs a Vicodin.  Yeah, yeah.  He needs that.  He was actually, yeah.  He's actually.  He's really helping me.  He's so afraid Jimmy's going to say, what was I thinking?  Is he the nicest guy or what?  Jimmy Fallon?  Yeah.  He's amazing.  He's great.  Yeah, he does seem very sincere.  He can't stand him.  Yeah.  I want to be an edgy guy who disagrees. 
[02:04:00]  Because that would be good.  That would be a great running bit, not to be all TV, but gym on gym.  We're like, we have Norton versus Fallon.  You know, he's holding a puppy.  You're.  Can I use.  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, it's filthy.  You're fucking it.  I would go for that in a second.  I don't think that.  You don't think they would do it over there?  No.  I'd actually pitch that.  Well, they have so many.  You don't have to fuck it.  I'll do the fucking.  Great idea.  There's so many tried bits already, so.  What do you think of this Carradine thing?  This story gets better and better every day, this David Carradine. 
[02:04:30]  Not for him.  How cool was that?  That like, you know.  How much stimulation do you need to fucking blow your nut, though?  Well, I don't know.  Do you need that much stimulation, David?  No, I don't know.  Well, I did this the other day, but it is, you know, McCainism, basically.  He was, you know, in the Orient, and it happened, and I think, you know, if this doesn't get  a, if this doesn't get Laura Ling back.  No, I think that's so cool. 
[02:05:00]  What a cool way to, you know, by the way, like, you know, surprise, I'm a cross-dressing  freak, you know, whatever.  Came out of nowhere.  Really did.  By the way, that movie, I mean, Kung Fu, the ultimate TV show.  Anybody not good at sports but had vengeance in their heart?  Yes.  That was definitely for everybody.  Kung Fu.  Just walking the earth.  What I liked about the David Carradine, the latest info, he had the red lingerie on the  bed that he decided that he didn't want to wear.  Or maybe he was going to change into it after he choked himself.  You think he had plans for the red lingerie? 
[02:05:30]  He's like, I'm going to cum.  Right.  Then I'm going to, like, just right when I'm choking out, I'm going to cum.  Then I'll pull the noose off my neck, and I'm going to get in the red lingerie and just  relax around the hotel a little while.  And see what's on pin before you know it.  He comes and goes, wait, I'm kind of black in the...  And that's all he remembers.  And that's it.  Eternity.  He built his own shit.  He was always experimenting with, like, these contraptions.  He was interested in, he tried fucking drowning, doing drowning stuff in his own pool.  Oh, that came out today, right.  What a fucking creep.  Drowning stuff?  Yeah, he just, he liked the idea of almost dying. 
[02:06:00]  And the horseback riding in...  What?  He would bareback horseback ride in Speedos.  He was like, his balls bounced around.  Let's not dwell on how the man died.  Let's not dwell on how he lived.  Celebrate his life.  Like, one time during Kung Fu, do you remember when he fought that double-headed dildo in his ass?  No, I liked his acting style in that, because it was, like, half Asian, half just sleepy baby.  Like, ha, but a teacher.  He was kind of asleep during the whole thing. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, it was good.  Until every...  And for such a non-violent guy, he got in a fight all the time.  Yeah.  But, and, like, why would you want to fight him?  He was a peaceful guy.  Just walked around.  Didn't hassle anybody.  Maybe he stole your wife's lingerie.  He was...  Could have been okay.  Could have been.  He was a monk.  Yeah, he's a monk.  He was a monk who was trying to defend the emperor's son or something.  Did they make him up?  Did they put, like, some kind of eye makeup on him to give him some kind of Asian eyes?  I think they gave him, like, they tied his balls in. 
[02:07:00]  And that's just the look he was making.  That got him hooked.  It's called getting into character back in the 70s.  I think they made him part Asian, just slightly.  Yeah, yeah.  They gave him some Asian thing.  Like, he had a distant relative that was Asian or something.  Yeah, he was.  He did look a little Asian.  His brother didn't at all.  No, no.  The Revenge of the Nerds guy is his brother.  What did he say about this whole thing?  Did he know this growing up?  Did they have bunk beds?  He did that funny nerds laugh and then started crying uncontrollably.  But Thailand, that must have been so cool.  I wonder if they even, like, you know, it's like, give me a carrot and, like, you go over 
[02:07:30]  there and, like, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, it's like a special.  Like naming a sandwich out of a...  Jimmy was just tweaking this whole...  Oh, no.  I was just...  Oh, Jimmy, what were you doing?  I took a picture of Dave and I did tweet it.  Oh.  But Dave doesn't like all this.  You've been tweeted with a funny caption.  You don't like the social networking.  I'm just an...  I'm an asshole.  I don't know.  Something tells me being found like that in Thailand is like getting hit by a car here.  Yeah.  It's just something like, you know, it's like, oh, another guy in lingerie hanging in the 
[02:08:00]  closet.  Joke jerking off.  If there's no child, it's considered an horrible dad.  He wasn't a kid guy, right?  I don't think he was, no.  Oh, that's cool.  He's the only one in Thailand, by the way, that isn't.  Yeah, he'll be worshipped as a god now.  He actually liked adult pussy.  That is so...  That is really cool.  Why else would you go to Thailand?  We've had this discussion on our show many times.  Just sexual deviance and mercenaries.  And then the listeners will call up and go, no, they've got nice beaches.  You know, it's so sad.  They're not going there for the beaches.  All the actors that can play him have already killed themselves.  I was thinking this would be cool. 
[02:08:30]  Heather...  What's his name?  Heath Ledger?  Heath Ledger.  Yeah.  I've done it.  Yeah.  No.  No.  That's so...  That is...  I'm loving this guy.  So he was wearing women's clothes?  Yeah.  The thing in fishnets.  The thing in fishnets and a wig.  Yeah, and he fucking...  Just balls were tied.  I just...  You know how blue these balls must have been when they found them?  Oh, swollen full of cum.  Oh, just that...  That last fucking orgasm that never came out.  Imagine the shock on the fucking corner when he untied the thing and it blasted in his face.  Oh, boy.  I should have seen this coming.  Do you think it was a quiet death or like outside somebody was trimming one of those 
[02:09:00]  bonsai trees and you hear...  What's the sound of the ball explosion?  Ball choking and whatever.  Yeah, he tied his hands above his head, too.  Like, he would do these weird things.  But how do you cum with your fucking hands tied around your head?  What a weird...  No, but he would want to just hang out like that for a while.  Yeah, maybe he just wanted to hang out.  One of his ex-wives used to find him in these weird positions in the bathroom. 
[02:09:30]  But what was he promoting?  Land of the Lost?  Or...  Why was he in Thailand?  He was filming a movie called Stretch.  Stretch.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Don't you love how that works out?  Filming a movie called Stretch.  It could have been better if the movie was called Dying With My Dick Out.  That would have been perfect, actually.  You know, they love wordplay when they die.  I've got to stop getting all my news from Byron Allen because at first I thought it was just  a hilarious take.  You never even know the comics on that show are doing their bits. 
[02:10:00]  That's the interesting part about his show.  It's organically funny.  Yeah.  You talk about anything for 10 minutes.  That's brilliant.  But he was 72 years old.  Now, that's pretty amazing for, you know...  I don't think he was that old.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't think he was that old.  And then to, you know, go out like that at 72.  You never know how old he was.  Is he Asian?  No, he just played one on TV.  Yeah.  Well, but yeah, that's how good he was.  You never knew.  You never knew.  What a gullible douchebag I am.  He's joking.  I'm like, for real, Dave?  At least he died doing what he loves.  I mean, come on.  He really did.  That's what we all want.  You're jerking off with a rope around your balls. 
[02:10:30]  We hate that sting.  That definitely wasn't the first time.  Like, you know, you got to know what you want.  Like, he's tried other things.  That isn't yet delving into something.  That is committing.  You've been there for quite a few years.  If you pick up the paper, there's a sex shop in L.A.  He went in there constantly, and he has some stuff that's coming in that he ordered.  And the lady's like, it's a shame he'll never get to pick this up.  I know what it is.  But everybody wants to know what the fuck it is.  I know what it is.  What?  It's an emergency take the ball gag off my something throat device. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  Written in Taiwanese.  Who's going to be forwarded to Thailand?  He got a chipped UPS ground.  That's why I didn't make it.  It's a fortune cookie that says a case.  What is this?  His tats would be not an autopsy.  Where is the sully of ball tying to save him?  Yeah, he should have been the kung fu of ball tying and known exactly how to do it.  Can you imagine, like, just running in there?  No time to explain.  I got this guy.  Tied him.  Balls.  Oh, Carradine? 
[02:11:30]  We know him.  Is that an autopsy photo?  It's supposedly the autopsy photo of David Carradine, but it doesn't show his face.  It shows the old staples down the...  But he can match up the tattoos, no?  Those are his tats?  If they're his tats, I don't know.  Do we really need an autopsy?  I mean, people pretty much know what happened.  Exactly.  Bodden's going over there.  Bodden's going to L.A. to do the second autopsy.  Probably see if he had any fucking drugs in him or if there's a strange person's semen in him or someone else.  Why send Bodden?  Bodden loves that stuff. 
[02:12:00]  Lives for death.  Dave, we had...  Love celebrity death.  We had Michael Bodden on the show.  You ever see him?  He had that HBO show called Autopsy.  Oh, he's great.  That morbid guy that just talked about him.  He loves death.  Looking at the stomach contents that she had died 12 hours before.  From the flies.  It's always like the flies will hatch.  They lay maggots in the wounds.  Oh, my gosh.  He gets so excited about death.  Did he have tidbits?  Oh, yeah.  Funny story.  I'm fucking a cadaver.  And it locks up around my dick. 
[02:12:30]  The phone rings.  We should tell people that David Teller's going to be at Caroline's.  These shows have got to be sold out.  I don't even think you need to be here, Dave.  Tonight.  In this economy, fellas.  Oh, really?  Right?  Come on.  Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  It's Friday, two shows.  Saturday, three.  And then Sunday, one.  I'm there with Jay.  With Jay O'Kerson.  And Louie Katz.  You know Louie from San Francisco?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I like Louie, man.  He's funny.  Louie is very...  Crossroads on the lounge chairs.  What?  Times Square.  Yeah.  Fucking assholes.  Oh, can I... 
[02:13:00]  Remember we were talking about this?  I was watching Ovation last night.  What's that?  It's usually the warning sign that you're gay.  Ovation is three channels away from Bravo, which is the can opener to oxygen, which is  really like waking up with a cock in your mouth.  So anyway, they had this documentary called After Tomorrow, which I thought was a Will Smith  movie, but it wasn't.  And it was about these Annies who were, you know, they played Annie on, you know, whatever.  And like, you know, they showed like Sarah Jessica Parker, who still is the only gay who's 
[02:13:30]  ever played it.  Shit!  But they show all these like broken dream Annies and orphans.  Andrea McCarnell?  Yes.  But she was like the first one.  Yeah, I don't know.  She's like working at like a hooter somewhere now.  Great.  Because you got to get like these girls in and like two of them like passed away.  I went to the site and everything.  Wow.  And like every day we're losing Annies like we're losing World War II vets.  So you got to get them in here.  Who the fuck knew?  Yeah.  They got problems too?  They couldn't get over it.  They cannot get over it.  Like they were so famous when they were like 12. 
[02:14:00]  And then, you know, like what happened?  And then they're nothing.  They're trying to play when they're 20 and act cute and young and just, it's finished.  And it's that whole like Broadway thing of like, you know, they hope they don't get  boobs, you know, because that like makes them not look like childlike.  They're not kids anymore.  How long would they play it for?  Like a year and a half.  They were going on the road.  Hey, that girl looked familiar.  How many Annies were there?  Fucking Annies.  How many Annies are we up to, you think?  A couple dozen maybe?  There was never a black Annie.  A Blanny, as we used to call it.  Wish you could sing Tamara. 
[02:14:30]  Pregnant.  You know what I'm saying.  Come on.  Some of these write themselves.  Tweet it.  Tweet.  Fucking David Tell.  How many Annies?  That's a good question.  And that would be, I'm going to go with it.  I'm going to go with 24.  Tamara.  I'll bet you 10 bucks there's probably been about 15.  15?  You say, I'll give you like the high, I'll give you whatever.  Can I overbid?  Over under.  Go ahead.  I can overbid?  All right.  I'll bet you a Tide Bowl sandwich with a.  That show's probably been on since the mid-70s. 
[02:15:00]  It's canceled, yeah.  I mean, but it started like the mid-70s and ran till when?  Wow, this guy really bets.  I love this.  I say 17.  I'm almost positive it was 17.  17 Annies.  Almost positive.  We usually do fake betting on the show, but he ripped out his money, so.  They can't go more than a couple of years.  So we've got to really do this now.  Here's a 20.  All right, my 20's out, too.  I'm going.  I'm going.  You can't go nothing unless you put your money on the table.  Can't a couple of guys just bet on how many Annies there were?  That's right.  I got 24.  How about the loser sucks the winner's cock, and then the winner returns a favor?  What kind of rules are we playing here? 
[02:15:30]  Are these prices right?  You already said you could overbid.  All right.  Closest.  No matter what.  What did I say, 15?  Yeah, I said 17.  I said 24.  Okay, so remember, they only get to do it for like two years or something like that.  I think Sarah Jessica did it for longer.  I know.  You got to kind of think that.  But at least one didn't do it that long.  I'm sure.  When did Danny start?  I'm going 13 years.  I said 17.  I'm so out.  I'm saying 13.  God damn it.  13?  I said 15.  17?  I think he's closer.  No, he's not.  No, no, no.  We'll see.  Danny?  Hang on.  Danny?  How many Antis?  He's going to...  Danny is the master of the internet. 
[02:16:00]  No, we call him king.  He was the king of the internet.  No, he's king of the internet.  So they never was...  They did have...  It really is funny.  There never was a black Annie.  Yeah.  I guess it kind of ended before like integration or something.  Yeah, before you could just pop anyone in a roll.  Yeah, back then it was like, you know, white orphans and...  One.  White orphans.  Two.  Uh-oh.  Three.  I remember the original Daddy Warbucks.  What's his name?  You know what's not going to be good when you can hear the newspaper being leafed through?  These are very unprepared bits. 
[02:16:30]  People want to know if Insomniac is done.  It is, I guess.  It's totally done.  That was a great show.  I'm too old.  Look at me.  That was an amazing show, though.  Yeah, it was all right.  No, it was great.  No, it was...  It was a lot of fun and like, you know, I was wishing that like two towns people like  go like, what town, like, you know, is the most fun party and we always go Brazil.  You've been down there.  Yes, it scared me, though.  Rio scared me.  It did?  It's too poverty stricken.  There's too many people that want your money and will slice you to get it.  It's just, that's what scared me about it.  Yeah, but you were down there when you were a single man and all that kind of stuff. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  Did you see any of that kind of weird sex play that this Carradine character?  No, I mean, but I just wanted to regular brothels and fucked.  I mean, there was nothing bizarre about it.  See how like I talk showed her?  That was pretty good talk show.  Yeah.  That was good.  Any of this rodeo whoop-dee-doo down on Hooska Dang?  No, you didn't see anything like that, right?  No, no.  But again, I didn't look for that stuff.  It was just me and Patrice and Bobby Kelly and a few of us just going to whorehouse.  Patrice.  You guys were looking for straight up man, Ernest Borgnine just got into port, you know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:17:30]  Bang, fuck, suck.  Yeah, just put a load in you.  Borgnine.  Do you have to watch the entire musical to get out of the end?  I know, right?  I'm really sorry I brought it up, guys.  I don't care.  I know.  We're all sitting there looking.  It's like waiting for a David Blaine trick to end here.  It's like, all right, well.  All of us looking at these Annies, a bunch of hard dicks in the room.  Oh, Annie trivia.  That David Blaine's terrific, though.  He's great.  He comes up with some crazy stuff.  He would have gotten out of that whole Carradine situation.  Yeah, but he would have, you know, had to do it in Times Square in the front of everybody.  And he would have had to carry it on for a week straight. 
[02:18:00]  There's something about the balls that they never should be tied.  I don't know what it is.  They should be held.  They should be held, yeah, on a chin.  I don't know if we're going to get the answer.  We might have stumped Annie.  Why don't you Google how many Annies have there been on Broadway?  Use the Google.  Where's the ask.com people?  Use the Google.  Where'd you Google?  Well, let's go through the...  All right, well, we can go back to that.  How many do you have so far?  I feel like I exhausted the crowd with...  No, not at all.  Hey, we should do the Letterman thing. 
[02:18:30]  Letterman's in some hot water today.  Yeah, what happened?  He did a Sarah Palin joke.  It was a great little joke.  I didn't hear it.  And then he was on a show trying to explain.  This is everywhere today.  Let's listen in on this as we try to find out how many Annies...  Does it include the 20th anniversary Broadway revival in 1997?  I'll throw it in for another five.  Hold on a minute.  I'm feeling lucky today.  I think so.  I need numbers, so I say yes.  If it's on Broadway, it would happen. 
[02:19:00]  Because we're not talking about road things or when they do it up in Boston or something  like that.  No, no.  Yeah, I think it's the road company Annies, too.  They consider themselves Annies.  No minor league Annies.  No minor leaguers.  No, come on.  We're talking the majors.  I got 17 Broadway Annies.  I'm not changing my fucking guess.  You said 15, you said 13.  How much is it?  I hope you said 68.  Yeah.  I'm just so out.  24.  I don't know.  Come on.  I can't find the number.  It's amazing.  All right, everyone put their money back.  Well, let's keep it.  We'll keep it out.  Just in case.  Someone will come up with it.  We'll get better on something else. 
[02:19:30]  Let's send that money to something important.  This is Letterman from last night.  Sarah Palin was in New York this week.  The hardest part of the trip was keeping Elliot Spitzer away from her daughter.  Now, that's, I'm surprised we haven't heard from Elliot Spitzer either.  Well, I'm not necessarily proud of these jokes.  I mean, we do stuff all the time, and our objective here is to get a laugh, and thank 
[02:20:00]  God, you know, we don't have to go to The Hague before the world court to defend them.  It's a joke.  That's all it's supposed to be.  That's what this is.  Now, here's the other joke they're upset about.  Sarah Palin went to a Yankees game yesterday.  There was one awkward moment during the seventh-inning stretch.  Her daughter was knocked up by Alex Rodriguez.  Oh, the joke.  The line.  The fuck?  The sports joke.  Yeah.  I'm telling you, I recognize that these are ugly. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  These are actually ugly.  These are borderline, but again, in an act of desperation, to get cheap laughs, which  is what I've been doing for the last 30 years.  Why didn't we hear from Alex Rodriguez?  There you go.  No big deal.  That's really good.  Sarah's all over it, though.  She's pissed.  Well, I think because the daughter that went to the game with it was 14.  Yeah, but...  It wasn't the other daughter.  Yeah, but the other man was just generalized.  It wasn't Bristol.  It was... 
[02:21:00]  No, there's the other one.  There's the other one.  The hotter one, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  No, they all have snow names.  Didn't we talk about that one time?  Yeah.  They're like Alaskan names.  Like money for nothing because you live in an oil state.  Anyway.  Did you guys ever watch that Gangland stuff?  Oh, yeah.  Love that.  Did you see that thing about the Alaskan gangs?  No, I missed the Alaskan ones.  Oh, that's a great one.  Wow.  It's really good because I think it's only one...  Like it's either the Crips or the Bloods or something like that. 
[02:21:30]  I don't want to get myself killed here.  But anyway, there's only one of them and they fight each other because they're lonely.  You know, because that's what they do.  Because they don't have another gang to fight.  They extort people like they keep throwing snow in your driveway into your fam.  I'm like the anti-conversation starter.  You know, it's like the Annie's.  How many Annie's are there?  How many Annie's?  I'm like the weird guy at the barbecue.  Hey.  And then Danny's digging through this.  Danny doesn't like to be defeated.  He's trying.  He's being humiliated right now.  It's hard to Google anything at it to begin with Bukkake in this office. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  Your computer's like, what happened?  Porno's a lot easier to find.  I know what Danny's doing right now.  He is counting.  Oh.  I believe he's counting.  We might have an answer.  How are you counting Annie?  We'll build detention like a Regis would.  He's going down the casting, it looks like.  And when the name changes, we're not fucking...  He's counting.  But we're not taking understudies.  No.  No, he knows.  How many are up to?  I'm going to get japped out of this.  I'll give you half of my money if you say money. 
[02:22:30]  I think you...  It's a really long list.  Yeah, it's really long.  I'm trying to go through it and I got to omit all of the understudy Annie's.  How many are you up to?  They should put them all on a wall somewhere.  You're only up to two?  There's a lot of understudies.  You've been scrolling for stupid understudies.  Oh, shit.  I've lost these.  Let's do a double or nothing with the dog.  How many dogs do they got?  That's easy to calculate.  How many Daddy Warbecks died of cancer? 
[02:23:00]  Figuring and ciphering.  Saffering.  Figuring.  What else is going on?  David Tell.  I'm on the road.  Yeah, I'm on the road.  I was in Salt Lake City.  Have you ever played that town, Jim?  No, I have not.  Horrible place, right?  Absolutely not.  They're totally...  When I first did the Insomniac show there years ago, you had to get a pass to drink in  the bars.  They had some weird laws to drink and all that kind of stuff.  But now they have everything.  They have the bars going.  They got Starbucks there, which is like...  They're not about coffee over there. 
[02:23:30]  And then they got strip clubs and an all-new club, which is called the Shame Factory.  No, I don't know what it's called.  I didn't know what it was.  You go in there and people just boo you as you exit.  But the, you know, they stoned like, you know, whatever.  Hornet, Jezebel, to the main stage.  Heartbreaker.  No, so I was on stage and I had all these Mormon openers, the Jack Mormons, you know,  that means they're like grew up Mormon.  And it was so funny because my crowd's a little drunk and some of them were like, you know, 
[02:24:00]  just like rambunctious, not bad or anything like that.  But the openers like had to control the crowd.  So it was funny, Mormon on Mormon violence, where they were using like, they didn't use  like Mormonisms.  They were like, you know, trying to curse each other out.  But it's not natural for them.  You know, it's like, mother, hecks.  Fuck you.  Fuckings.  You know, fuckers.  Easy, you child of two parents.  Oh.  And then I said, you know, when you guys curse, you know, every time you do, Marie 
[02:24:30]  Osmond eats a bagel.  And that quieted him down.  I used some of my Jew, you know, sarcasm on him.  It's like, you know, acid on a bride's face in Pakistan.  Quietes him down.  Hey, we're winning in Pakistan.  What do you think about that, Anthony?  We're chasing them out.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  The tallies are on the run.  The Taliban is on the run.  We're doing good over there?  Hey, let's just make it easier.  How many Annies have done porn?  None of them.  Right?  Who is that?  You got to think one.  Oh, she played Vicky, that girl. 
[02:25:00]  That's not Annie?  No, it's Vicky.  How many Vickys were there?  Double or nothing.  How many Vickys died of chlamydia?  That one's listed as playing Annie.  Why don't you just Google how many women are red-haired in this country?  How many get residual checks?  Gingas.  Wow.  What do you think of this whole shooting guy at the...  Well, I think he was a little angry.  A little angry.  He's horrible.  Just a tad.  A little angry.  Yeah.  A little anti-Semitic.  Yeah, really.  That was hardcore.  And white supremacist. 
[02:25:30]  What a terribly planned attack, though.  I mean, it's like if you're going to go in and shoot a place up and you shoot a security  guard, it's like, what a dope...  Yeah, he really didn't have the plan there.  I mean, I don't know.  He just walked in and just...  I think he just wanted to start firing.  Yeah, maybe get sympathy for his cause by shooting up a Holocaust museum.  The fuck do you like?  Yeah, this is going to get people to rally behind.  I bet the press picks up on this and shows my good side after I'm gone.  He had had it, right?  Wasn't he also...  Wasn't he something else happened to him?  Yeah, years ago, he went into the federal bank and... 
[02:26:00]  Caused some problems.  And caused a ruckus trying to make a citizen's arrest on the head of the federal bank because  the interest rates were too high.  How would you think that's going to work, though?  And he was loaded for bear then, too.  He had shotguns and all kinds of good stuff.  They're going to go, thank you, sir.  That's very helpful.  That's horrible.  What a horrible picture of him, too.  Yeah, he looks feminine.  There's something feminine about his neck.  Yeah, he does look like he's wearing a little lipstick.  He looks like some kind of impersonator.  Yes.  Without the wig. 
[02:26:30]  Like, I could see him in a rocking chair, like, you know, knitting something and talking  about, like, Mark Twain or something.  He looks evil, everyone.  But he's...  You're never too old to kill anyone.  That's the beauty.  That's the thing of the story.  That's the silver lining there.  Fat ass says there's 11 annies.  Wow.  Well, who said 13?  That goes up to 1997.  That's when the show closed?  No.  So, apparently, the show opened on August 10th, 1976. 
[02:27:00]  All right.  Pre-Broadway tryout.  So, we got to count that.  No, that was in Connecticut.  Hold on.  This guy has from 77.  All right, Broadway.  April 21st, 77.  I think I have a number.  Two.  Two.  Only till November 28th of 81.  Yeah.  After 1,485 performances.  Wow.  And that was it.  So, that's fucking it.  What are you talking about?  Then there was a revival on 98 from 28th of February, September 98 to February 99. 
[02:27:30]  Sorry, I've seen it at least 17,000.  That's the narrator.  She went to Annie.  She was one of the last girls to perform the role.  Who was the last Annie?  That's at the Hippodrome.  Did she leave by helicopter from the roof?  I'm done with y'all.  I'm out.  Um, Danny, what number do you have?  For the original Broadway play, this is not including the revival. 
[02:28:00]  Get close to 24.  It's nowhere close.  Fuck.  What was it?  The number I've come up with, I don't know if there might be more.  I said six.  Can I change my number?  No.  I said 13.  I know.  I said 15 and I'm sticking with it.  I now say 12.  No!  Okay.  What?  Shut up!  Dave said okay!  No, I said 13.  You ain't fucking doing shit.  All right.  24 it is.  All right.  Well, you guys are going to be pretty disappointed because I've only been able to locate five.  No.  I said six.  Incarnations of Anne.  No, you didn't say six. 
[02:28:30]  Don't try to fucking jack me.  I'll fucking...  There's only five of them?  From the original play?  Yeah.  I mean, there's a bunch of understudies and alternates, but...  No, let's count the understudies.  Five.  Let's see.  Broadway original.  Andrew McGarnell.  Yep.  Reed Shelton.  No, that's Daddy Warbucks.  Hold on.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Andrew McGarnell.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Shelley Bruce.  Yep.  Uh-huh.  Sarah Jessica Parker.  Yep.  Allison Smith.  Yep.  And Allison Kirk.  Yep.  Yep.  So those are the five. 
[02:29:00]  And then the revival...  Da-da-da-da-da.  Let me get to the revival.  The show was later revived at the Victoria Palace.  That is not the United States.  United States National Touring Company.  Ba-ba-ba.  Tim-ba-ba-de-de-de-de-de-de-de.  Come on.  Where is the fucking revival?  I have one name.  It's the revival...  Broadway revival.  97.  Entitled Annie.  20th anniversary starring Nell Carter and later Sally Struthers as Miss Hannigan.  So there was a black Annie then.  Well, no.  She was not Annie.  Oh.  Fucking...  Uh, let's see. 
[02:29:30]  Broadway ran...  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  That's a Nell Carter as Annie.  Molly.  That's a great visual.  Yeah.  Who played Annie?  Let me see.  Annie on...  I have the name.  Andrea Keisman.  What?  Wow.  As the orphan swing Annie understudy played Pepper and Andrea...  Wow.  I think it's only one.  Can I just say it?  Yeah, go ahead.  Is Brittany Kissinger?  Yes.  Okay.  I got that one.  Kissinger then, eight, became the youngest actress ever to play Annie on Broadway. 
[02:30:00]  Wow.  But it says, who played Pepper and Andrea Keisman as the orphan swing slash Annie understudy.  Okay.  All right.  So that makes...  She was an orphan and an understudy, but then Kissinger was eight and she was Annie.  So that's six.  Wow.  No, if my math...  Even James Lipton turned this off.  This is way too gay.  I'm sorry, guys.  I apologize to the listeners, to everyone for even bringing it up.  I thought it would be just kind of a fun little twist.  So who won?  Six Annie's.  I win with the lowest bit of 13, my friend. 
[02:30:30]  There you go.  What?  There you go, little girl.  Fucking A. Annie just made me so much.  Motherfucker.  How did our $10 bet turn into a $20 bet?  Ah, thank you.  A $20 bet.  Ah, thank you.  I knew I'd...  All 20s?  I win a little money with my Broadway knowledge.  You guys see the picture of Phil Spector in the paper today without his wig?  He looks better without the wig.  He was an Annie.  How many wigs did Phil Spector own?  Yeah.  He looks a little bit like an Annie.  He could play Annie.  Did he play Annie?  I think it was an understudy. 
[02:31:00]  He has a fine horseshoe when he's not wearing that wig.  Does he?  Oh, it's brutal.  That whole big afro thing is a wig?  Yep.  It's ridiculous.  Amazing, right?  No hair falls for hair, man.  He's always piercing his wig.  His lips, like he's a model or something.  Yeah.  He looks like the fucking killer...  I can't think of the movie.  From Little Children.  He looks like that guy.  What's his name?  Stacy, uh...  He's a guy from the Bad News Bears who...  Uh, uh...  Leach?  He played the pedophile?  I'm not a...  Oh, it's not Stacy Keach. 
[02:31:30]  No, no, that's Vic Morrow?  No, no.  Come on.  Little Children.  Like, he was in the Bad News Bears and then he grew up and...  Kelly Leak?  Oh, Kelly Leak.  Oh, yeah.  What's the movie?  I want you to buy that.  Yeah.  It's a really good movie.  Oh, my God.  That's Phil Spector.  Yeah.  Holy shit, he's got a skullet.  He's like three stories or something, right, in that movie?  Mm.  Dave, what's that movie?  That big girl with a wig?  Yeah.  Why would he wear that wig?  I don't know.  It's got, uh...  What's...  Jennifer Connelly's in it and, um...  What's her name?  The girl from the Titanic. 
[02:32:00]  And, uh...  Kate Winslet?  Winslet.  Yeah, it's a good movie.  It's really good.  Look at the wild hair.  Mm.  And the wild hair was...  He looks better like that, I'm telling you.  I could see him with the Annie wig on.  That would be a great punishment.  He looks like a creep, man.  He just...  I guess he was.  Yeah.  What is he?  He shot a girl in his house.  How tall is he?  How many, like, celebrity colonics do you think he had?  Like, doesn't he look like one of those guys, like, I don't eat...  I eat baby food and...  Yeah.  ...like a crystal or something?  Is he only, like, 5'4"? 
[02:32:30]  No.  Come on.  He didn't look that tall on the...  That's why he wore that wig.  Give him a few more inches.  Give him a little, uh...  He looks ridiculous on the wig.  Well, he sure does, Jimmy.  Thank you, Captain Obvious.  Yeah.  Is it a wig, or is he doing some weird, grew it out, blew it dry, and teased it up?  Get the fuck out of here.  Does he have green eyes, or is he staring into my soul?  Does he?  He has a very comfortable and a shirt-looking neck.  Oh, God.  He does look a lizard type. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  He's a lizard, man.  Yeah.  Oof.  He's an insurance-selling get-go.  He's, like, five-foot, uh...  A horrible man.  Five-five.  Oh.  A little fella.  People are suggesting we show David Tell the train video from the other day.  Let me say it.  Are you a big fan of the videos on the Internet, Dave?  Train?  I never keep up with them.  I'm a few behind.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got one that stands out, though?  Me?  For me, personally?  Yeah.  One that made you go, wow.  Love the Internet. 
[02:33:30]  Well, there is a great...  I think it was the third Annie.  Yeah.  That's her name.  Got a bit of a mishap.  Her, you know, little womanly time came in.  They fired her immediately.  Which Annie's are dead?  In mid-dance?  No, I really don't keep up with it.  So, has it been getting good?  Like, is it all skateboard accidents and stuff?  I like the skateboard accidents.  I like when the friends laugh at the guy until he passes out.  I think that's what friendship is about.  Oh, dude, you're never going to walk again. 
[02:34:00]  I know!  Most of them are a waste of time, but every once in a while you get a doozy.  Is this a sexual one?  No, I don't even want to say.  You just got to see it yourself.  Oh, it's a surprise one.  It's good.  I think you would appreciate it.  Well, that Susan Boyle thing, that was a disappointment.  I could barely rub one out to that.  Why did they give her a makeover?  Yeah, that was dumb.  What was that going to come up with?  They should have done it with a shotgun.  They put in a sweater on a dog. 
[02:34:30]  You still can't eat at a restaurant.  And then she went immediately insane.  She didn't even get 15 minutes.  The show ended.  She went right to the mental hospital.  Oh, here it is.  There it is.  Full screen.  Here we go.  Is there like a beheading?  No.  No.  Well, sort of.  No, no, no.  Oh, come on.  This is in India, where they travel on trains inside, outside. 
[02:35:00]  The Slumdog Millionaire.  Don't worry about it.  Guess what's going to happen.  Tell me that.  Wait for it.  Oh, this will just be wait for it.  All right.  This guy's like, hey, let me on.  I got a ticket.  Oh, jeez.  There's a lot of smoke coming off of him.  His hat is on fire, by the way. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  His hat is on fire.  Do you think he feels anything there or no?  No.  Wait, you're missing the voiceover.  The local from Calcutta to Bombay is delayed.  You know what, though?  My favorite part of the video is the guy that goes on the train just assuming that this will  be a quick little thing and the train will take off.  There, they probably do just brush him off and get the train rolling.  You think?  There's not an investigation, really?  No.  Why would there be?  No yellow tape, nothing.  It's all on surveillance camera.  It's all on video.  That is pretty amazing. 
[02:36:00]  It looks almost like it's Pixar.  Yeah, like fake.  Yeah.  He touches that wire.  Why would you grab that wire?  The wire powers a locomotive.  He was dead before he hit the top of the train.  Oh, hell yeah.  Am I dumb, guys, to think that I could do that and would make it?  Am I getting the wrong message from these videos?  Yeah, I think you are getting the wrong message.  It's not a handrail up there.  I mean...  It's a high-voltage wire.  Can I say this?  How shitty is this country?  They can't bury their high wires? 
[02:36:30]  You don't expect a guy to be on the train grabbing at it, either.  They put it out of view.  Can't you see he's a performance artist?  He's probably doing like, come on, y'all, I need some claps.  You want me to do some of my crack-ups?  Wow.  I'd like to know, in this country, though, how many people die from hitting that third rail?  Because that thing is just sitting out there.  It is protected, though.  It's got a little thing going over it.  It's got a little wooden thing over it.  Yeah, but why can't they figure out the third rail thing?  Because they probably, in the train, he has to touch it.  He needs power.  I understand, but there's got to be a way to, you know...  I don't know.  You know what would have saved his life? 
[02:37:00]  A long extension cord.  A steam engine.  Steam engine.  Yes.  Never happened with a steam engine.  I think we found David Blaine's next trick.  That is definitely...  I'm glad you guys showed that to me.  Not only did he get zapped, but then the unfortunate turn that he fell into it with his head when  he fell down, like right there.  He's completely on fire.  Right there.  He's on fire.  When you pause it right now, he's like, he just realized, uh-oh, I made a mistake.  Oh, boy.  And then the fall couldn't have tickled if he had the least bit of consciousness left.  That fucking first. 
[02:37:30]  Wouldn't it be funny if that's what killed him?  He banged his head?  Autopsy is a blunt force concussion to the head.  So, can we do this with the Guantanamo guys?  Geez, look at that fire flash.  Now, that's a flash.  Wow.  Is this a different angle or something?  No, Danny.  It's like one frame.  One frame.  One amazing frame.  He's completely...  This fire has engulfed this guy.  Do you think this is going to...  What's his name is going to do this on his Spike show?  Jesse...  James.  Yeah, Jesse James.  Yeah, on that killed Jesse James show or whatever it is. 
[02:38:00]  That is an amazing...  That is wild.  I like how everybody just backs up a little bit because they don't want to...  That's a spot on the hell train.  I'm online.  Yeah.  On the death train.  It would be even better if, like, that flash activated all the Bengal tiger release.  And they all, like...  Bengal tiger?  What the fuck?  I like somebody's being...  The worst death, of course, is being...  You know the baby elephant?  Yeah.  You know, like...  Because he can't really lift you up and do that kind of, like... 
[02:38:30]  Smash you around.  Smashing you in the ass.  How did he wind up falling on his back if he's facing that way now?  I want to see, like, another one.  He just spun around in an awful pirouette.  He does a little pirouette of death.  He's cute.  It's a great fall, man.  And his arms are just out there, like, dead guy, fucking frozen arm guy.  Just smoking time.  Just coming off him.  I remember what one guy said to him right before...  You do?  Yeah, he says, like, did you hear about David Carradine?  And he's like, oh, I thought we were going to do a movie.  What happened? 
[02:39:00]  That is so horrible.  Ow, my head's on fire.  Yeah, look at that.  You don't think he feels anything at that point, right?  You know how moist your head is?  You know what it takes for your head to catch on fire?  I don't think they have body hair, so I think, you know, it went right to the skin.  No, the Indians are very hairy.  No?  They're very hairy legs.  Oh.  They're a hairy-legged people.  Well, that is...  And how...  What happened?  Like, you know...  There's no follow-up to these.  Is this, like, a weird, like, thing that goes on over there?  Is that what they do?  It's America's Funniest Home Videos. 
[02:39:30]  They just pile them on the trains, and they...  You know, Saget's good, but he's not that good.  He couldn't funny this up.  He'd have to go, you know...  India's Funniest Home Videos.  It's a toss.  It might have been funnier, but...  They ride the top of the train, Dave.  You don't have to go in the train.  You didn't see Swim Dog Millionaire?  You know, I didn't see it, no.  It's a good movie.  Is that good?  Do you like movies?  I like movies, but I'm not really a fan of India.  Like, I never wanted to go there as a kid, and I think, like, it just smells, like, just  smelly.  Like, sad smells.  Like, burning people on a train smell. 
[02:40:00]  Burning train people.  The food smells awful.  Curry.  A lot of curry.  No, I like the people, but I really don't want to go...  Like, my brother was there, and he said, like, they have the weird, like, panhandling,  not like in the city here, where they all have a joke and a sign.  There, I'll cut my daughter's arm off.  Yeah, like, rip their eyeballs out for...  I saw that in Slum Dog.  So, you showed up with India, right?  Yeah.  We just assumed.  We assume a lot on the show.  No, there was some guy from India that called up yesterday and confirmed it was India.  Oh, that's right.  You're right.  Because he translated some of the people's reactions. 
[02:40:30]  Wow.  Saying, he's dead, he's dead.  One guy was yelling, apparently.  Do you think they're going to make a movie about that guy now, or...?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they'd have to.  That is...  What a horrible way to die.  But is it a horrible way to die?  Do you feel that at all?  Like, he got...  That guy knew nothing.  Well, it's horrible, because he looks like a young guy.  Well, I think it's the cameraman.  It's like 80-something, and then you go out that way, and that's kind of a good way to  go out.  The sound of that.  That boosh.  That's a lot of electricity going through you.  Do you feel that?  I'm wondering if you feel that, or is it so instantaneous that you don't... 
[02:41:00]  Or are you alive for a few seconds?  Was that as shocking as realizing that you guys have been Twittering, Jimmy?  You can't get over that?  I think he just got a tweet.  What's worse?  Whoa!  I was talking about Twittering with Jimmy Fallon or the Annie thing.  Yeah.  You had us dead.  I'm so glad that you showed me that, because that was really what I did to comedy with  the Annie bit.  I was on a train going nowhere, and also I grabbed the wire, called Annie.  Sometimes it ain't about to... 
[02:41:30]  That was really a shocking video.  You know, as a child, we've all wanted to travel on top of trains, but never.  Not...  No.  You can't.  Even in India, where life...  They do that in Brazil, too.  They do?  The train surf, and then a lot of them get signs and stuff.  They used to do it here in New York.  Yeah, they hit the underpasses and find them dead on the side of the tracks.  They finally figured out how to stop it in New York.  Why don't we take a break, and when we get back, we're not going to talk about Annie.  All right.  How about that?  Let's go.  David Tell, Friday through Sunday at Caroline's.  212-757-4100.  I don't have to tell you, David Tell is hilarious, and these tickets are going to sell really fast, 
[02:42:00]  so get on the phone.  They're open for business right now.  Get on the horn.  212-757-4100.  212-757-4100.  Hanging with David Tell.  He's going to be at Caroline's this weekend.  212-757-4100.  Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  Right?  For David Tell.  I've gotten a text from Dr. Steve, man, about the explosion.  I read this off the air, but I'll read it on the air.  It's about the...  Why was the guy dead on impact? 
[02:42:30]  He said he was dead within microseconds of the first thwomp, and the fact that he capitalized  and wrote T-H-W-O-O-O-M-P and put it in quotes, it makes me want to fucking just lop his feet  off.  His brain turned to carbon immediately.  Your reaction time is three-tenths of a second.  He was dead before that.  And then I wrote, did the eyeballs explode?  Because somebody asked that.  I asked that, yeah.  And he wrote, they absolutely could.  That kind of heat in an enclosed sphere of fluid, sure.  The current would have to pass through or near the eyes to vaporize the liquid.  And then he wrote, I'm going to amend my answer. 
[02:43:00]  Usually when you get a high voltage, it travels over the surface.  He put surface in capital letters.  Of the conductor, which he wrote was his skin.  That's why he was on fire.  And I wrote, but felt nothing.  And he wrote, oh my God.  It was instantaneous.  In the electric chair, it's a little different.  The current causes the heart to stop.  In this case, it was like he was getting a blow to the head as well.  At the speed of light.  So no, I can't imagine he felt a thing.  And on a lighter note, how's your herpes? 
[02:43:30]  So wait, so the eyeballs might explode.  They might not?  Might, might not.  It's a 50-50 shot.  You don't know.  I wouldn't stand in front of him, though, just in case.  That's electricity for you.  You really don't know.  You've got to respect it.  Yeah.  That's something you toyed with.  It's an odd little thing, electricity.  It's electricity.  Electricity is like a wild 88-year-old man with a loaded gun in it.  This guy's like five.  And hating his heart.  I know, but he's like five hate groups behind.  Blacks and Jews.  That's like yesterday's news. 
[02:44:00]  Stop it.  Way more.  Yeah.  There's other people to hate.  There's new people to hate.  88.  Let's go to Footer.  Footer!  Yo, good morning, boys.  Hey, man.  Hey, why don't you let a tell no?  First of all, dude, you fucking rock.  You are hysterical.  Hey, thanks, man.  No problem, man.  And do you realize that, you know, the boys talked about this a few days ago, but you have  definitely a really big influence on a lot of comics out there, dude.  You know, not just drastically biting off your shit, but just your approach. 
[02:44:30]  Jimmy had mentioned it a little bit, so time to kiss your ass a little bit.  Let's...  Yeah, I was saying that the other day, like, how many guys you see, like, that you've been  very influential in, accidentally so.  You know, just guys that do, like, a tell isn't it?  Yes.  Keep going.  Well, not hitting the fruit thing.  The Fit Banny.  Hey, thank...  You know, first of all, I gotta say, to anybody who knows comedy and, like, follows it besides,  like, just like, hey, I saw a guy in a movie and I want to go see him at the local comic,  thank you for knowing comedy.  Like, Jim is a big supporter and you guys have always, like, you know, like, showed it 
[02:45:00]  more than what it is, that it's...  That they're, like, people are out there writing material and everyone's got a different  take, so thanks for that.  And, uh, when you say that I'm an influence, that means I'm over.  So, uh...  Yeah, yeah.  I kind of agree with you.  It's like Dave and I have said many times, my job is to entertain them.  I would like to, uh...  I would like to be shocked back into entertaining people.  I don't think I'm entertaining at all.  The way I tell influence people, like, Louis will notice it more because Louis is not at 
[02:45:30]  the cellar that much or any other club.  Like, he'll just pop in and, like, I just don't want to tell.  Like, you'll just see, like, a comedian who doesn't know, but Dave has such a specific  way that he holds the microphone, and these little, these little...  They're just Dave's behaviors.  People copying my emphysema.  People mimicking Dave's near-death experience every night they say.  But these little things that you see comedians doing, and I don't even realize that they've  been very influenced by Dave.  Well, thanks.  That's it, man.  I just wanted to let you know that.  Great job, and I will talk to you boys later. 
[02:46:00]  I'm out.  All right, footer.  Why are we looking at a YouTube video that's titled David Tell on Good Day, Alabama?  Oh, when was that?  Wow.  What happened on this show?  Wow, that looks like a pimp and two whores.  Look at them leaning over to show interest.  Wasn't I kicked off that show?  For real?  No, I don't know.  I remember it was...  I would imagine...  No, no, I couldn't say anything because it was too dirty, you know.  But there's some fun happening out there, I'm sure.  Actually, all the news lately has been a little down, you know. 
[02:46:30]  A little down, yeah.  They're rough.  I wish you didn't bring that up, but I think we could talk about...  Yeah, I like to think my act is kind of newsproof.  I mean, if there's something in there, it's a little salacious, you know, a little blue.  Yeah.  But, you know, basically, I talk about drinking and, you know, partying.  Do you guys have a drink now?  I guess you can with the mornings, though.  Yeah, we drink a lot in the mornings.  It's off, you know.  Yeah, not so much, but... 
[02:47:00]  They're probably luscious.  A power drink, maybe.  You know, a little...  We're all in our eyes.  This is a huge mistake.  Everybody in that room, the camera...  Sorry, but I do drink and think, but I want to tell the kids right now, don't drink and drive.  All right?  And I love kids.  Yeah.  You're serious about that?  Yeah, no, I'm on the internet talking to them all day.  Pause that for a second.  All right.  God, why can't they pick up on anything?  This is the greatest.  That's the idiot.  I don't know how...  I can barely do it.  God damn it.  There's no way you could ever do it.  I'm horrendous.  I do the same thing you did.  I throw it back to them.  But you guys must like to have a drink and hope they say something funny and we all laugh 
[02:47:30]  and I get credit for it.  Like, we're all having fun together.  It's fucking awful.  They are the best smile you the fuck out of a room, people.  Like, local morning TV.  Like, look, thank you for coming back.  You know, like, get out of here.  Beat it.  Holy shit.  You smile you the fuck out of the room.  That's exactly the name for it.  Different.  Okay, thank you for coming by.  Look how I definitely look like an Armenian pimp who's, uh... 
[02:48:00]  It's like a deleted scene from Taken.  It's like, how much for the blonde with the short hair?  God, I'm ugly.  You actually look good on that.  You fucking look thin.  You look confident.  I love kids on the internet with them all the time, he says.  I have my Indian packing my chest hair out.  Yes.  It is good.  Nice look.  I didn't hear the internet line.  I don't know the internet.  Oh, the internet?  No, that was the line.  I heard that.  I'm like, oh my god, did they catch that?  No, that's the one line where you're like, uh, you know, this is definitely... 
[02:48:30]  It's not dirty, but it's really not appropriate.  It's not appropriate.  But you're, like, kind of, like, hoping a friend will watch it and, like, say something.  Yeah.  For Alabama morning radio.  They're not picking up on anything, though.  I wish they would always bring me in, like, for the weather, when they do the weather,  I think, because the weather person is the wackiest person in the news.  They are always the drunks and the drug addicts, and, you know, it's like, let's go to whatever,  and they never know where they're standing, and, you know, like, for some reason, the  girls have to have a gigantic rack when they do the weather to get people interested in  weather. 
[02:49:00]  Whatever.  But, uh, dudes, thanks for having me in, guys.  I know you got a big night tonight, so how are you going to play it?  Who's going to be a good cop?  Who's going to be bad?  Wait, I want to hear the rest of that.  There's nothing else there.  We want to hear the internet line again.  Ticket sales are going to go down.  I think he doesn't want us to play this.  I'm dying to see this.  Go ahead.  A little salacious, you know, a little blue.  But, uh, you know, I'm using my hands a lot.  I talk about drinking and, you know, partying.  Do you guys have a drink?  Now, I guess you can with the morning stuff.  Yeah, drink a lot of the morning stuff.  You seem to look like we're a French. 
[02:49:30]  Not so much, but...  Have a power drink, maybe.  You know, a little Red Bull.  He's got a Kool-Aid in the back.  Well, Red Bull's all right.  Yeah.  Well, Red Bull's all right.  So, yeah, but I do drink and think, but I want to tell the kids right now, don't drink  and drive, all right?  And I love kids.  Yeah.  You're serious about that?  Yeah, no, I'm on the internet talking to them all day.  Yeah.  I didn't catch that.  You've got the cameraman laughing.  You know, it's good.  Bring the goats back in.  Yeah.  Here we go.  In the time we have left, we just get picked up here, Ryan.  Wouldn't that be great?  Well, when he came in, I said, you know, this is G-Raid, and he understands that. 
[02:50:00]  No, let's get what we're doing here together.  Let's do it, ladies, and take on the view.  What do you think?  Okay.  I think we can.  The view, come on.  Definitely.  We can be a little, we can do another level of it.  Alabama could handle a little New York.  You're a lot cuter than Rosie O'Donnell.  Well, thank you.  Very nice, Karen.  That's a good gig for her.  Yeah.  That was like, Alabama.  You know, they're at the end of this gig.  All right, it's 444-0008-stardome.com.  You can go check out the Instagram. 
[02:50:30]  People are going to go there now.  By the way, Birmingham, Alabama, three American Idol winners.  Really?  Yeah, something, two or three of them.  How'd that gig work out?  There was a lot of buybacks.  Luckily, I, well, what happened?  These two come down to the show.  They're lit.  We're all doing nitrous.  These two come buckets, come rolling down here. 
[02:51:00]  I promised them a T-shirt and a reach around.  And, uh, no, that, that was a rough, that's a rough town for me.  How are you?  Birmingham?  Never did it.  What's with you?  Don't, what, what?  I want to go out and do a bunch of cities that I've never done before.  Birmingham, Alabama, Salt Lake City.  Those are two I'd absolutely do.  I want to do Oklahoma.  I said that already, but I've never done Oklahoma.  Hey, you know, you could do this tour, man.  I want to do the Lewis and Clark tour from St. Louis to Seattle.  Let's do that.  Through Montana and the other regions where they're not going to get you.  Let's do that.  And, uh, I would actually like to do that. 
[02:51:30]  You're going to do it to raise money for his family.  He has a divine bronze so they can bury him properly.  Keeps pointing at the picture.  You guys want to do Hollywood 411 with Club Soda Canning?  Oh, is it a new one?  It's a new one.  Then I surely would listen.  Yeah, Club Soda Canning doing a bit for us, Dave.  He's talking about, uh, you know, pop culture and what's going on out there.  You guys bumped him up from coffee getter to actual, he's a correspondent.  Yeah, you know, the interns are on our show.  Well, anything Kenny's into, I'm into.  Let's do it. 
[02:52:00]  Whatever it takes to get to 11 o'clock every day.  It can't be any, it can't be funnier than that morning, good morning, cock-a-doodle-doo Alabama clip.  Go ahead.  The Hollywood 411 with Club Soda Canning.  We'll start off with Kim Kardashian.  Did you hear she got a haircut?  Who cut her hair, a blind butcher?  Here's a poem for Kim.  Kim, you're a woman of style and a woman of class, but the best thing about you is you're a big fat ass.  Let me tell you something. 
[02:52:30]  If we were both squirrels, I'd store my nuts in her hole.  The only time I would kick her out of bed would be to fuck her on the floor.  Last week.  What do you think so far?  Kick her out of bed to fuck her on the floor is fine.  I think it's true.  You don't like the poem?  I think she got a haircut.  It's all true.  I like the poem because I couldn't see it coming.  Yeah, yeah.  Well hidden.  Class.  Class.  Class.  Gee, when you hear class as the rhyme word.  And it has something to do with Kim Kardashian.  Yeah, wow. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  Let me think.  Are we supposed to rate him?  Oh, I just figured it is.  I'd give it four annies.  Four annies.  Go ahead.  One dead annie.  You've got to give me commitment.  I'll commit to a shitty bit.  One uncircumcised savage on a train roof.  I'll give it four annies.  I'll give it four annies.  I'll give it four annies.  I'll give it four annies.  That's an average man.  Hollywood.  Get down, animal.  You're going to hurt the train.  Get down.  That was how they promoted Slumdog coming out on DVD. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, with that video.  With the magic of electric activity.  I like it.  Last week at the Tony Awards, Bret Michaels had a little treble.  Besides being bald, now he's got a broken face.  But he's got a lot of well-wishers.  They all would like to throw him down one.  Oh, well.  Hollywood.  Wow.  What?  It's a well joke.  Oh.  A well? 
[02:54:00]  It's a well.  Oh, well.  Is it an anti-whaling joke?  What's wrong with him?  What's oh well mean?  Do you know how many people die a year from whales?  Whales?  Oh, he said well.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Oh, well.  Oh, he doesn't like them.  Yeah.  That's different.  Adam Lamberts shocked the world this week by admitting he's a faggala.  He never fooled me because I got gaydar.  Good for him.  More chicks for me.  Have a good time for yourselves, pillow biters.  Faggots crack me up the way they fuck each other in the ass. 
[02:54:30]  You know, they give each other the meat nozzle.  And you know what's funny?  When they do a turd cough after ass fucking.  I'd like to see a photo of him farting cum out of his ass.  I bet you his anal audio is better than his singing.  And this has been the Hollywood 411 with me, Club Soda Kenny.  The only 411 better than the morning mashup.  Goodbye.  The Hollywood 411 with Club Soda Kenny.  That was.  Who listens to these before he plays? 
[02:55:00]  Is he out of his mind?  Can I get that on Hulu?  Who listens to that?  Does the producer listen to this?  I think Troy Kwan.  His producer.  No, but does our fucking producer.  Our producer listened to that before that.  I'm sure Sam worked on it with him.  Because I would assume that is a little over the top.  A little too much?  Even for satellite radio?  As far as, yeah, offending certain groups.  It's just pointless.  I thought that they said, Kenny, here's two written and you make up the last one. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, that's what it seemed like.  Yeah, it seemed like it was really from the heart.  It seemed like the last one was more just Kenny going off and remembering his ex-cop days.  Yeah, he did sound like a cop.  Just, you know.  So we should admit that that was a little crazy.  But it's still, you've got to get the entertainment news out there.  Yeah, well, how are you going to do it?  Right, David?  Yeah, well, there were a lot of people who were fans and they were also shocked, much like the train incident, that he was gay.  I didn't think he was gay.  I mean, there's something called subtlety. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, well.  Double entendre.  Double entendre.  Comes to mind.  You know.  Yeah, like.  Job preservation.  Right, comes to mind.  You know, things like that.  Does anyone understand that, like, that.  Let's blame Iroch.  Iroch, come on in here and explain.  That isn't what you air and stay out of trouble?  Iroch, what happened?  I have no idea.  Well, that's good.  So, well, is he gay? 
[02:56:30]  I mean.  Yeah, he came out.  His family said that.  Rolling Stone magazine, he admits it.  Iroch, what's, um.  He gave it to Rolling Stone.  But, I mean, after a shit fart, when he was washing his beat nozzle.  Yeah, I, uh.  He's a nozzle.  Who listened to that with, not just the, is it funny or is it that.  Who listened to that and said, this could be on the air without any, I don't see any trouble from this.  I would, I have no idea.  I have no involvement with that creative process. 
[02:57:00]  Kenny has his own little group.  No, it's not the creative process.  It's, it's a, a getting from there to the air process.  This is the first I've heard of.  Why don't we bring in Sam?  Because I think Sam produces the 411.  How about the producer of the show?  All right, let's get to Sam.  Sam.  Well, there's a gay guy on, uh, Instant Feedback.  Chumpy Cohen writes, uh, I'm gay and I say it was fucking funny.  Well, of course they're going to be gay.  And Porky York from Minnesota, the Porky York says, good work, Kenny, another home run. 
[02:57:30]  Did, did, did you hear that?  That was the perfect one.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, because when we were writing it, we were trying to mimic last week's and he  kind of did the same thing.  No, last week's wasn't quite.  What did he do last week that was so bad?  I mean, he did go crazy last, he did with Kate's, uh, pussy.  And he did a gay thing too last week.  No one's saying you can't do a gay thing.  Of course you can do it.  You can make fun of gay people, but.  That was a little over the top. 
[02:58:00]  Uh, I'm almost impossible to make uncomfortable with humor.  Almost impossible.  What part made you uncomfortable?  The meat nozzle?  No.  No.  That's stupid.  Meat nozzle's good.  Look, I'm uncomfortable keeping my job.  That's all I'm uncomfortable with.  Yeah, two faggots.  Yeah, you're like, ugh.  Unless there was a reason for it or a point to it in the joke, then it makes sense.  Yeah, yeah.  If we, you know, call each other a faggot, it's, it, it's different.  It's used differently.  It's one of those weird, like, like N-word things, I think. 
[02:58:30]  Ooh.  Right.  Amongst buddies.  It's, you know, you're kind of.  So what is he saying about him?  Is he getting married or?  Yeah, what was the point of it, actually?  I don't know.  Where was he going with that?  To me, that's just kind of shit that would just get us in trouble.  That will just cause problems.  Of course, that wasn't.  That's all I see.  That's all I see is that causing huge amounts of problems.  If somebody, you know, doesn't like it and wants to present that, they could just say, 
[02:59:00]  here's what they play.  And then have, oh, look, there's, there's them, big gay bashing.  Well, can we rewind it?  But don't you think we earned a lot of gay credits with the Annie talk?  Yeah.  We probably did as far as the Broadway thing goes.  I'd say the Seesaw is pretty much in the middle.  I think so.  You think we're at a perfect balance now?  What was it again?  The shit hiccup?  That really took it down towards the answer.  That's fine.  Any type of dumb reference like that is fine.  Because if you're talking about fucking a girl and you do something vulgar, you can use  any type of stupid euphemisms for it you want. 
[02:59:30]  Right.  Here's Kenny, the star of the Hollywood 411.  Doesn't even realize that he started a big controversy.  I think it was the, um, the, uh.  Kenny!  You know.  The inflammatory words.  Hello.  Hello.  Are you completely out of your mind?  Yes.  Did you, did you write that last segment with the, um, the young gentleman from American  Idol?  Do I need plausible deniability?  No, I do. 
[03:00:00]  It was a proof through the chain of command.  What's the chain of command?  All right.  What's the chain of command?  That's what I need to know.  Who is the final word for that thing actually being played?  Does somebody want to explain this?  Yeah, I already did.  I mean.  I didn't hear who got the final word.  Who, who, who's the one that goes, I listened to it.  And, and regardless of funny, this, that, I listened to it, it's okay.  Like, you wouldn't play a bit if it had some type of, um, defamation in it. 
[03:00:30]  No.  Or something like that.  So, who listens to it to look for that?  I just listen to it and then give it to Troy and then we bring it in.  There's no, um.  I like the little pass to Troy.  There's a little, there's a little pass to Troy that happened there.  I'm just letting you know everybody who's involved.  What about, what about Steve?  Our illustrious producer, Steve Carlisi.  Did not get a chance to listen to.  He didn't get a chance to listen.  What was Steve doing before he got a chance to listen? 
[03:01:00]  I, I don't know.  Does he normally listen to them?  No.  No.  Shouldn't the producer of the show listen to what goes on there and think, and think in  terms of not if it's funny or not, because I do not want him or anyone gauging if something's  funny or not.  But if there is something on there that is, um, going to be a problem, maybe.  I'm not even saying this will be or would be. 
[03:01:30]  I'm just saying.  Does anyone have that little check valve safety in place?  Not at the moment.  I want to address a couple of people on phones, too.  For being cunt, cock, rag, dick, fuck, shit, bitches.  Oh, shit.  Let's say hi to Mike in New York.  Hey, Mike.  Uh, seriously?  Yeah.  Dude, you make fun of everything.  Everything.  Yep, yep.  A little gay joke?  Really?  A little gay joke.  Right, right.  Dude, you gotta admit, you're a pussy. 
[03:02:00]  Listen to the real-  You don't listen to that, Mike, and think perhaps it might get it.  Do you think I give a flying fuck?  Huh, Mike?  Answer me, cunt!  I'm trying to keep a job!  Dude, you-  Dummy!  Now, this is one thing that you have a problem with?  Mike, you're being unrealistic.  Dude, do you honestly think the company wouldn't have a problem?  Do you think I sit here and have a problem with a lot of shit?  I look at stuff in the big picture and go, I think somebody has to listen to something 
[03:02:30]  to see if someone else is gonna have a problem.  Do you understand what the fuck I'm even talking about, you dumb son of a cunt?  Okay, so what-  Yeah, alright, hold on.  When you're making, uh, black jokes, why-  Why do, uh-  No one said you can't make gay jokes.  Did I ever, did I ever drop the N-bomb on this fucking show?  Alright, we-  Did I?  Answer me!  You fucking asshole!  Answer me!  Awkward.  Did I?  Did I?  Did I? 
[03:03:00]  Mike?  Yes.  Shithead.  Dave, just look down.  Huh?  Listen, you make enough, just relax, dude.  Shut the fuck up!  Shut up!  You need to relax.  Shut your fucking mouth, Mike!  What's the matter?  You didn't get any last night?  Get any?  Yeah, you had that whore fucking cunt mother of yours came over and sucked my fucking dick,  drained the cum out of it, and I pumped it all down her fucking throat till it came out  her nose, that whore cunt mother of yours. 
[03:03:30]  Heterosexual.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  You know what?  Walt, I'm a fraser, fuck, beep in her mouth.  Mike, did you say that again?  We couldn't hear you.  The phone cut out.  Yeah, I get it.  We got off on the wrong foot.  I'm sorry, Mike.  Let's go to Keith in New York.  Keith?  No, Anthony's the one who fucking, if that was a black joke, it would be no big deal.  It's a fucking fag joke.  He's going to make a big deal.  What black jokes do I make?  I'm not saying, do you know how many gay jokes we make on this show, and how many black jokes,  and how many, any other jokes we make on this show, when you use the term fag, when you 
[03:04:00]  use the term fag, in a derogatory manner, as far as gay people go, you're asking for  trouble.  Not that, do you think I'm fucking offended by the word fag?  I'm being honest here.  I could give a shit!  I'm saying that, alright, I'll be a pussy.  I'll be a pussy.  You guinea fuck, I'm 17 years old.  There we go.  There we go.  Alright.  Every time you use the word fag, Neil Patrick Harris turns around. 
[03:04:30]  Wait, no, I'm trying to make a point, guys.  Now, I gotta be the asshole here, for actually trying to keep us from, and these are, every  one of these motherfuckers would be like, what happened?  They got suspended?  They got fired?  They got this?  Where did I go?  You fucking idiot.  17, grow a hair on your ball.  Alright.  Oh well.  You want any more of these phone calls, eh?  I don't care.  Alright, which one do you want?  You tell me.  I don't care.  Pick one. 
[03:05:00]  Alright.  Take them all.  All comers.  Alright, I'll do this one for you.  Kelly in Idaho.  Oh God, I just love when Anthony goes off on these idiots.  Oh, thank you.  I realize I'm a redneck from Idaho, but...  Thank you, girl name.  Stupid.  I realize it.  It's not my job.  Alright.  Well, you raise a good point, miss.  Let's go to Knock in Washington.  Knock.  Go ahead, Knock.  Hey, morning, boys.  Hey, how you doing?  Go ahead.  I love this because I have an answer for you already. 
[03:05:30]  Go ahead.  What?  Hey, you know, I agree with you as far as needing to be careful.  Yeah.  Job protection, man.  So, the bottom line is that you've got GLAAD, you've got these other groups who are trying  to fuck you guys over.  Yes.  So, you know, in terms of that, but at the same time, where do you drive a line?  You do...  You guys are an edgy show, so...  Yes, we're an edgy show, and we're on satellite radio, but you know something? 
[03:06:00]  We got fucking suspended from satellite radio because a homeless guy decided to talk about  how he wants to have sex with the president's wife, Barbara, or what's her name?  Laura Bush.  Laura Bush and Condoleezza Rice.  Condoleezza Rice and the Queen of England.  It was a homeless guy who was hysterical, came in, homeless ramblings into the microphone,  and they suspended us from satellite radio because of that.  I don't remember.  I don't feel like being fucking suspended or fired anymore.  I agree, man.  I'm kind of out of that point in my fucking career where I want to sit at home wondering 
[03:06:30]  how I'm going to pay for my shit.  I agree, Anthony.  I'm exiting with my arms randomly punching.  Bye-bye.  All right.  So, no more firings?  How about one more for old times?  I'll take one more when we're ready.  When we're ready, a blaze of fucking glory, my friend.  Blaze of glory.  The best part, this might be a little inside, but Mike R. and Pat Shaw goes,  I love how Ant said he's never dropped the N-word on this show. 
[03:07:00]  No, of course not.  Not on this show.  I don't drop the N-bomb in public.  On any show.  No.  Right.  You do lean over and whisper it often.  You know what?  This guy wants you just to calm down.  Larry in Connecticut.  Larry.  Larry.  Hey.  We appreciate your opinion on this radio show of ours.  Well, thank you, sirs.  First of all, I want to say I'm looking forward to seeing Opie and Schneider from One Day at a Time on Jimmy Fallon. 
[03:07:30]  That's right, Pat Harrington.  He starts out with a good joke.  I'll give him that.  Schneider.  I'm going to roll some cigarettes up in my sleep.  Did anyone come up with that one yet?  Yeah.  Yeah, I've said it many times.  Yeah.  No.  It's been said.  You're handsome, gentlemen, sir.  Yeah, thank you.  I just wanted to say, calm down, man.  Didn't you guys play a little ditty called Shit Dick yesterday?  Yes, we did.  Yeah, David, tell him something.  I forgot about that.  We did.  We did play Shit Dick.  There is a bit of a difference on that one. 
[03:08:00]  Dude, Ant is totally right.  He's not making a judgment on, like, that was tasteless.  I don't go for that.  I don't care.  But he's talking about this shitty climate and it's common sense.  And I heard it and I thought the same thing.  I'm not offended.  I looked over at Jimmy as it was playing and went like, uh-oh.  And I just want to know what the chain of command is and who approves stuff like that.  Or at least doesn't say, hey, guys, listen to this.  Do you think this would be okay or not?  And now we have Mr. Steve Carlesi, who that bit was actually about, in the room right now. 
[03:08:30]  No, it wasn't.  The chain of command, I have a feeling, is now going to change with Sam's bits, with Sam's and Kenny's bits.  No, don't.  I'm not saying hold back.  I'm not saying anything like that.  Just, I want to hear it, perhaps, maybe, Ope, give it a listen, Jimmy, just so we can go like,  that might be a sticky wicket if we have to defend that.  You know, you've got to look at something and go, are we really going to be able to defend that 
[03:09:00]  if it shows up as a sound bite somewhere?  We never listen to bits before they're played, which is our stupidity,  but we assume that there's fucking people behind the scenes who are listening with common sense.  And we're not saying don't be nasty or edgy, because we expect that.  Yes.  You know what?  In all fairness, you guys do listen to a lot of bits before they hit the air.  And I'm not, and in this case, Sam's been very good in the past of reigning Kenny in,  because Kenny's out of his fucking mind.  Of course he is.  Oh, shit. 
[03:09:30]  Just seeing him as a cop.  See what happened there.  Oh, fantastic.  No, and in the past, don't be sad, Kenny.  Don't be, Kenny.  It's okay.  I can't be responsible for anything bad happening to you guys.  No, no, you're an artist.  You're an artist, so what you do is what you do.  It then has to run through the proper channels.  Yeah, Kenny, you're just an artist.  Don't worry about it.  You're just the talent.  You're like a Gigi Allen type.  You don't have to worry about that.  You're good.  All right, thank you.  It's in between point A and point B, which is your mouth and the speakers that people listen  to the show. 
[03:10:00]  In between there, some things have to be done.  I still apologize to you.  Don't worry about it.  And any of those sweet-in-the-pants people I offended.  Don't worry about it.  Oh, well, you know.  It's just so fucking stupid.  It's just, yeah.  It's fucking annoyingly stupid.  There's certain things that are not very defendable when put in a soundbite.  And you know, we know over the years, there's no getting your chance to get your side of  the story out or try to say, what we meant was, the context was, blah, blah, no one hears 
[03:10:30]  it, play the soundbite.  That's what happens.  That's why I think we've got to be just a little smarter when it comes to some of those  things.  Unless we want to just all, if we all want to fucking lose our jobs, that's fine then.  Then let's just do that.  Can I say one thing as a guest?  Yes, sure.  Michael, first of all, I was going to go see the movie Bruno.  I don't think I'm going to see it now.  I'm afraid some of those things might happen.  It might be too offensive.  Yeah.  You know something? 
[03:11:00]  I'm afraid I'm not going to see it.  You know, at school, you get to see the process.  It is funny, though.  Sacha Baron Cohen brings a black baby out and he goes, I named it O.J.  And that's like in the trailers.  And we're worried that the word faggot was played.  We're going to get in Dutch.  A double standard.  It is a total.  It is a double standard.  That's the problem.  Radio guys suck.  Everyone else is all right.  Believe me, I'd like to sit here and say everything that's in my head every second of the day.  But I can't.  Please don't.  But I can't.  I can only do it through my rolled up Escalade windows as I'm driving through traffic with 
[03:11:30]  stereotypical people that can't drive.  Listening to Wagner.  But there aren't a lot of things on this.  There really are not a lot of things that make, like I said, I'm like fucking, very, very few.  Could be like a problem.  That's all.  I wasn't getting uncomfortable with the content.  I don't care.  It's not like it bothers me like, oh, gee, I'm personally offended.  No.  I'm just thinking like that's a sticking point that's like, oh, boy. 
[03:12:00]  And you have to think, well, the company back us.  No.  Right.  Oh, no.  Exactly.  That's another thing.  The company back us.  Ha!  Ha!  No.  What is that based on, Ant?  Unbacking.  On a history of unbacking.  Yeah.  Wait for the book.  Holy shit.  Not to be backed.  The latest one's amazing.  The latest one's amazing.  Backless.  The latest one's amazing.  So, you know, I just kind of want to.  That's all.  So how many Antis?  I was going to say, are you guys going to play that on Fallon tonight? 
[03:12:30]  Six total.  Counting the revival.  Yeah.  Okay.  You got to play that on Fallon tonight.  Yeah.  Dave, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry the appearance ended so weird.  Hey, you know what?  A little strange.  It was awkward.  A little awkward.  Yeah.  You know, I like to see that you guys get things, you know, done.  You have a problem.  You don't hide it.  You have to vent these things on the air.  Yeah.  You get it out.  Yes.  You know, I get up and I'm hard.  Would it help if we put Jason on the phone?  He's gay and he loved the bit.  He liked it.  What is this going to be? 
[03:13:00]  A stereotypical gay voice guy from Brooklyn that is going to make like he's.  No, nothing stereotypical.  Love your show.  I listen to it all the time.  Okay.  He's a real gay guy.  This guy is so gay.  He's really gay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can tell.  You can tell by the voice.  Very gay, actually.  What's up there, sir?  Yeah.  Not that gay.  I'm gay, but not that gay.  But listen, I had no problem with what you guys were saying and what Kenny did.  And I thought the humor in it was fine.  Oh, that's okay.  So next time you sign my paycheck, make sure the address is right. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, that's right.  You don't.  You're right.  You're very right.  We'll just have to agree to disagree.  On more than one thing, my friend.  I think you guys are cool.  You're one gay listener.  Yes.  We have two.  Maybe three.  I think we have three.  We actually have so many more than you'd think.  No, I know you do.  I know you do.  I can't even go into fucking peep booze anymore.  I'm afraid I'm going to peek through the glory hole and someone's going to go, 
[03:14:00]  Happy birthday, little Jimmy.  You know, I don't even listen to Alcee.  I love your show.  And even with the gay jokes, you're just watching.  We don't have a reverend gay al out there.  You do.  Yeah.  We do.  Really.  Believe me.  Believe me.  You gays are represented.  Yeah, you're well represented.  We've seen it happen.  Well, there you go.  That should make us all feel better.  All right.  Thank you, Sean.  All right.  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  If one of them says something.  Jason, got us.  Probably.  Yeah.  Well, thanks for having me, guys. 
[03:14:30]  Oh, well, no problem.  That's my laugh, Cable.  Now we know that there has to be a...  It's like the Cuban Missile Crisis.  They put the hotline in afterwards.  But Dave is next.  Now we know.  Dave's never seen that before.  He's feeling a little uncomfortable.  Yeah.  I feel like, you know,  it's like going over someone's house  like when they're, you know,  like, hey, let's play,  I don't know,  like electric football or whatever.  And then, like, you know,  the parents are like,  you know, I never loved you. 
[03:15:00]  You were a mistake.  You came to my house?  Yeah.  The spaghetti hits the wall.  Jeremy's got some...  Anthony starts crying.  Jeremy's got some advice for you.  All right.  Jeremy in Cleveland.  Yes.  Hey, Anthony,  you got to calm down.  You're going to blow out those hair plugs  before that big deal.  I don't have hair plugs.  You know,  you want to keep the hair plugs in your head.  I don't have hair plugs.  Imagine if you touched that fucking wire.  What would happen?  That hair would come flying out.  I would fall down just like the guy did on the train.  Yeah.  And no plugs would go shooting out of my head. 
[03:15:30]  They'd be launched like fucking 4th of July fireworks.  It would look like a hair sparkler or something.  Just flying out.  They call him something chasers.  I can't remember.  See how he brings it all back, people.  Oh, look at me.  What did I say?  You're crazy.  You're a shock jock.  That's me.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  All right.  I'm Fallon tonight.  David Kell.  Yes.  At Caroline's tomorrow, Saturday, Sunday.  All shows, of course, will sell out.  We got the old carbon brain wants to say something. 
[03:16:00]  E-Rock, what do you got?  All right.  Well, let's end the show with a positive note here.  You're suicide.  Gifts for what?  No, no.  I didn't mean it.  This is very family.  Whose gifts are these?  These are from Caitlin from yesterday.  Oh, wow.  She didn't want to come upstairs.  Hope it's her pussy in a bag.  Thanks.  Who's Caitlin?  The chick we had on yesterday.  Who's Caitlin?  Listen to you.  Thanks.  The girl with the tits.  Oh, the girl with the tits.  Sure. 
[03:16:30]  She bought me some fucking rice cakes.  Holy shit.  Oh, wow.  She gives good gifts.  Caitlin, you could have saved money.  A blowjob would have been perfect.  There's no reason to spend your money.  Dan, look this up on wine.com.  Dave, you drink wine.  This is good.  A bottle of Jameson and Gran Torino on Blu-ray.  That's right.  And fucking bullets.  Directed to the Holocaust Museum.  Oh, shit.  She brought me two Bruce Springsteen CDs.  Gran Torino on Blu-ray. 
[03:17:00]  You know Roland had something to do with this gift.  Lightly salted rice cakes and smuckers.  Reduced fat peanut butter.  Wow, because that's what you were eating yesterday.  All she had to do, if she would have just showed me her ass while I jacked off for 30 seconds,  I would have plugged her for a month.  Thank you very much.  Are you going to movie review camp?  Rice cakes?  Lionel Richie will get you through it.  If you look up my wine.  What's it at?  What's the price?  Something bird.  Luigi Bosca.  B-O-S-C-A. 
[03:17:30]  What type of wine is it?  A Merlot?  I call it a Malbec.  Oh.  Look at you.  I don't know.  I like the fact that my card is signed Roland Campos and Kate Cooper.  Oh, it is?  Yeah, Roland helped out with a gift.  Of course he did.  At least you got a card.  If this wine is less than $20 on Wine.com, we're going to have a problem.  Yep.  Oh, boy, are we going to have a problem.  Dan, you got the official price?  Oh, you will.  You want the regular price or the special price?  What am I going with, the regular price or the special price?  Both. 
[03:18:00]  Regular first.  Yeah.  Regular price, $21.99.  Uh-oh, special price.  $19.79.  Hey, 21 cents, you got to give it to her.  She doesn't know.  She only has a demo.  What?  Nothing.  I'm just like, why are you saying what?  I didn't do nothing.  Maybe you were gesturing.  I wasn't gesturing for nothing, Heavy.  Why would you?  I mean, sure, it's a good bottle of wine, 1979.  What will that go for at a restaurant? 
[03:18:30]  Well, you got to double it, so.  Double it.  You're talking of a $40 bottle of wine.  Hey, what's the matter?  Did you just smell something bad?  You made a face.  What?  Your nose crinkled, and you kind of squinted your eyes, and you looked at me, and then  your head went back like, pfft.  Pfft.  Special price is what?  Lampert, huh?  Special price is $19.79.  Got a 91 in one.  That was the year Annie came out, I think. 
[03:19:00]  Huh?  What do you mean?  Why you got a stress thing there, Dave?  What the fuck is this thing called stress in here?  What is that, Nicole?  You need a stress doll.  You're not used to people fighting in front of you.  Yeah, that was very...  That was uncomfortable to you.  Yeah, it was a little uncomfortable.  I always yell at the listeners, though.  No, no, I like that.  Yeah.  No, that's very cool.  That's fun.  No, but when you're, you know, with the staff and everything, it was very...  Oh, yeah.  Well, it gets uncomfortable.  I never yell at the staff.  No, I think it's cool that you get it out, though.  I try to talk very logically with the staff. 
[03:19:30]  I mean, I totally get what you guys are doing in this, you know, economy right now.  Yeah, yeah.  You know.  Right?  I like that sense of everything, though.  They're all, you know, they got us by the purse strings.  You got to whatever.  You guys are blown off the fact that I got a rule with all wine I get on this show.  It's got to be over $20 a bottle on wine.com.  I know.  $20.  But it's $90.  You missed by a couple of cents.  You don't pardon her?  I pardon you.  She had great tits.  Yeah, think of it.  Those tits.  Those tits, right?  Yeah, that bottle could go for...  Did you get pretzels, too? 
[03:20:00]  I sure did.  Why didn't I get pretzels?  You want them?  Yes.  I want to have a couple.  It's worth more than your wine.  Why is Dave leaving our show?  I'm not leaving.  I'm not leaving.  Jesus.  It's all right, Dave.  We're leaving, too.  I want to leave you guys with your gifts.  You want pretzel?  Yeah.  Two comics.  You're sharing a few pretzels.  Have some carbs.  Where did E-Rock go?  Those are those good little stick ones.  You find those in the back of your couch, in the couch cushions, and in your car seat. 
[03:20:30]  I find these in my cock hole and anus.  These are so sleepover friendly.  Go on.  Did you finger blast her?  I mean...  Go on.  Jimmy's sleepover party.  All right.  Oh, my God. 
[03:21:00]  These are delicious.  How are the pretzels?  The best thing that she gave her, these pretzels.  These pretzels are making me thirsty.  They're rolling.  I'm sure Jameson.  That won't hurt the appearance tonight.  Maybe I should down this bottle of Jameson before I go out there.  First headbutt on the Jimmy Fallon show.  Come over here, baby.  Bang.  Anthony headbutts the floor.  I'm going to punish you.  I'll be like Steve-O on fucking...  Choke you.  Adam Carolla's joke.  Choke you.  I guess we're going to just leave. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah, let's take off.  Very good.  I'll put the Jameson in my bar, so that way if someone wants to enjoy Jameson, they can.  Chilled.  Because I am not really a Jameson fan.  Thank you, Kate Cooper.  Yes.  Kate?  Yes.  What'd she do for the show?  She was great yesterday.  But I'll have Grant Serino playing.  Yes.  Her heavy breasts.  Breasts.  Yeah, remember that?  The weightiness of her breasts.  See, now we're leaving later than we wanted to.  Yeah, I know.  Thanks for having me, guys.  All righty.  Thank you for coming. 
[03:22:00]  You're just going to leave like this?  Hey, let's go.  Don't leave yet.  Why are you leaving?  Wait for two seconds.  Wait for the mics to go off for two seconds.  Yeah.  Don't go anywhere yet.  Because you have to be privy to something.  All right.  Okay.  Privy to what?  Nothing.  Just end the show.  No!  Why?  Give me a hint.  I'm not saying a word.  All right.  I'm not saying a word.  All right.  We're out.  Thank you, David Teller.  Yes, like Jimmy said, Caroline.  It's going to be terrific.  212-757-4100.  We'll be on Fallon tonight. 
[03:22:30]  Very cool.  And we'll see you guys tomorrow.  Bye.  Bye. </pre>
