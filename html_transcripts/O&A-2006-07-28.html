<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with chaotic banter, sexually explicit comments, and derogatory remarks from Opie, Anthony, and James Norton. A behind-the-scenes argument erupts with sound technician E-Rock over music cues.  The hosts, along with guests Rich Voss and his wife Bonnie McFarlane, then launch into a discussion of MTV's "My Super Sweet 16," mocking the extravagance and perceived entitlement of the teenage participants.  Numerous offensive and stereotypical comments are made, interspersed with audio clips from the show, contrasting the depicted lifestyles with Voss's more modest daughter's Sweet 16 party at a firehouse.

The conversation pivots to Logo TV and "Guys Gone Wild," with sexually explicit jokes and commentary provided by staff member Sam, whose race becomes the subject of further jokes and racially charged remarks from the hosts.  Listener calls contribute to the chaotic and offensive atmosphere.  The hosts also discuss the arrest of Senator Norm Coleman's 81-year-old father for having sex in a car with a 38-year-old woman, using crude analogies to describe aging and Viagra. This leads to a discussion of "assaults on the media," specifically focusing on a prank involving fake blood interrupting a live news report on bicycle theft, featuring Jody Applegate’s angry reaction.  Audio issues initially disrupt this segment.  The hosts mention upcoming guests Disturbed and Mick Foley, and briefly mention Sam again before a commercial break. Several listener calls are mentioned without detailed content.

Opie and Anthony recount a negative experience filming a corporate video, highlighting frustrations with the cameraman and mandatory sexual harassment training.  They then discuss Jody Applegate's reaction to the bicycle theft prank again.  The focus shifts to a conversation with Rich Voss and the band Disturbed, covering Voss's career, upcoming Comedy Central pilot, Jewish heritage, and tattoos. The conversation turns to the Israeli-Hezbollah conflict, with Voss sharing personal experiences and opinions, sparking a heated debate.  A caller criticizes Disturbed's anti-war messaging, prompting the band to explain their perspective and respect for soldiers.  The segment concludes with a description of their daily walk to the studio, including giving away OzFest tickets, interacting with a homeless man named Mac, and Voss performing an impromptu stand-up set at a diner with mixed reactions.

A significant portion of the show centers on reactions to Rich Voss's stand-up performances, with callers praising his crowd work while others criticize it as offensive, leading to a heated debate with highly offensive language used by callers and the hosts.  Specific criticisms target Voss's heckling style and jokes.  Other listener calls cover a successful Nashville meet-and-greet, one of the hosts’ body hair grooming, a coworker's pores, a debate on "buttery beats" music potentially associated with gay sex (with homophobic language used), Lance Bass's coming out and the media reaction, Floyd Landis' drug test, and the upcoming David Letterman appearance.  The hosts discuss potential outfit choices and nervousness for the Letterman appearance. A caller describes a bizarre Canadian birthday tradition called “the bumps”.

The show further discusses the upcoming David Letterman appearance, focusing on seating arrangements and potential material, referencing past controversial stunts.  A significant portion is dedicated to playing confrontational voicemails left by Rich Voss for Bonnie, revealing his paranoia, accusations, and anger.  The hosts and callers discuss Voss's behavior, with Bonnie's perspective included, highlighting his possessiveness and jealousy.  The discussion touches on Voss's excessive golfing and Bonnie's reasons for not answering her phone. The segment ends with an on-air kiss between Bonnie and Rich. The hosts also mention a TV commercial and positive feedback regarding XM subscriptions.

A listener call from Colorado is interrupted by a tractor-trailer horn.  The hosts then discuss a possible accusation against one of them, referencing a former neighbor and MySpace messages, leading to staged phone calls with implied infidelity and dramatic cut-offs featuring Rich Voss and Bonnie McFarlane.  The conversation transitions to Voss's Comedy Central pilot and mentions Greg Charles at Caroline's Comedy Club.  The show concludes with audio from a segment on opiananthony.com featuring Casey and Van's bicycle theft prank on "Good Day New York," including the fake injury, Jody Applegate's angry reaction, and significant shouting and profanity.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  Messicans.  That sucks.  Lesbians.  I like that in a woman.  Read every other kind of TV.  I love paying for sex.  This moral decay weakens our resistance to the onslaught of the communist masters of deceit.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  And yeah, we're back.  Where have you been? 
[00:00:30]  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for power.  Here it comes!  Here it comes!  The O.P. and Anthony program.  El Vidos.  The O.P. and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  O.P.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that fact.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with 
[00:01:00]  Down syndrome children.  No, baby!  It's terrible.  The O.P. and Anthony show.  But enough of this clever.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, E-Rock leaving the studio in a huff.  What happened there?  Oh, he's giving someone a talking to.  Because he cued me.  I hit the Rage Against the Machine music that you're hearing in the background because everyone  wants to know what this song is. 
[00:01:30]  It's Street Fighting Man by Rage Against the Machine.  Starts every O.P. and Anthony broadcast.  So he goes, and go.  So I hit, music starts, and then you hear in the background, but enough of this palaver.  Oh, no.  That got E-Rock up and running.  Who's responsible for that?  I have no idea, but he left in a huff.  E-Rock's racking head.  He left in a huff.  We'll get an update in just a bit here.  It's Friday. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, thank you.  Friday.  It's Friday.  It's just pacing.  Now he's in the other studio.  He wants answers.  Where is he?  All right, here comes E-Rock.  What happened?  E-Rock.  Love the passion and the anger.  What happened?  I don't know. 
[00:02:30]  I don't know.  It was like there was a delay before the palaver.  It should have been right at the end of it.  All right.  Trying to find out who made it.  Oh, who cares?  Look at his face.  He's heated.  He's all heated and angry.  He's just trying to cover his ass.  Yeah, make it.  He figures if he does that, we'll assume it wasn't him.  Right.  That did it.  Like, imagine if you're at the office or wherever you work, and you make a mistake,  and you get up all angry and go looking for the guy that did it, everyone would look and  go, wow, someone screwed up. 
[00:03:00]  It couldn't have been him because he's the angry guy.  Great strategy, E-Rock.  Wow.  I commend you for that one.  I was buying it until you just gave me that.  I bring nothing to the table.  Yeah.  Is this on?  I have no power over, like, one person.  Boss, shut up.  Okay.  Throw your headphones on, and then you would know that you have to, like, you know, talk  a little louder into the microphone.  No one was hearing what you were saying there.  Good point.  Are you ready to broadcast?  Yeah.  Professional broadcasters.  With your grandfather glasses on. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, my God.  The bifocals.  Are those bifocals?  Oh, God.  They're so little.  Like, they're very...  I wanted something to match my hands.  But they're bifocals?  Yeah.  Well, you know, they're reading glasses.  Oh, reading glasses.  Isn't that what they're called when, you know, you can't see when you're reading?  Don't worry.  You don't need to read.  Just sit there and be funny.  He rarely wears them.  Obviously.  And I have no excuse. 
[00:04:00]  You can't say, I didn't see the word.  I need glasses.  Well...  That's why I pronounced it completely wrong.  The whole spelling thing throws me off.  Well, we're going to do Stoner Spelling Bee today, actually.  Mm-hmm.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  Welcome.  Yes.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  The official welcome here.  Our phone number is 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Sitting in for Jim Norton today, Rich Voss and his lovely wife, Bonnie.  What's going on?  What part is the ick? 
[00:04:30]  The ick part is that you're married to him?  I think the lovely wife part, yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah, being Rich's wife.  She wants to be her own person.  Yeah, man.  She is.  I think, you know...  Huh?  You know, we have separate lives.  Nah, you two are like...  We do not.  I can't do anything without you on my butt.  You two are like a team now.  Yeah.  Like a...  Still and Mira?  Yeah, Still and Mira.  Gracie.  Do you think we should do an act together?  Would that be great? 
[00:05:00]  With a singing?  You could take a singing lesson or something.  Canes and top hats.  Rah-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Rah-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  It would be awesome.  We always go through it together.  You guys.  Come near and go far.  Oh, you could do that a whole act.  Tap the cane.  Tick, tick, tick.  Bonnie, did you hear the one about the guy who hasn't had a bite in six weeks?  No, Rich, what'd you do?  I bit him.  And he died from my teeth.  These two could bring back vaudeville. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Vossville.  Vossville.  It's what the country needs right now.  Oh, yeah.  It is to bring us back.  The country needs less moss.  Well, neither of us could sing, you know.  We'll do some USO tours.  That's great.  Come on.  Mm-hmm.  Just before we went on the air here, I was asking Rich and Bonnie if they watch My Super  Sweet 16.  Yeah.  And it turns out, Bonnie, you watch it, right?  Yeah, I've seen it, yeah.  And, Rich? 
[00:06:00]  I saw like half an episode or an episode.  I've seen, you know.  It's nothing but spoiled bitches.  Oh, the one.  And their parents giving them everything for their 16th birthday.  Making their 16th birthday the highlight of their life.  It's pretty much it.  Bigger than weddings.  Yeah, yeah.  More expensive.  And it's usually topped off with a beamer out front with a big bow tied around it.  But before the beamer, it's the act.  The big rap star.  Yeah, they got to get a big rap star.  And they cry if they don't get it. 
[00:06:30]  Like, I want a 50 cent to be at my Sweet 16.  And my father couldn't get it.  He's the worst father ever.  I wish he was dead.  And they're crying and everything.  And then the last minute, the father gets like the big guy.  Yeah.  Big rap star.  Well, one of these chicks got Usher.  Yeah.  Why would you want somebody at your Sweet 16 party that whenever he leaves the room, you  got to make him clap so you know he's not stealing.  So silverware.  Yeah, Usher needs the silverware.  Yeah, Usher's pilfering from a Sweet 16 party.  Yeah, Usher needs to do that. 
[00:07:00]  He's out front selling his CDs.  But one of the points I want to make, though, from time to time, they do the on the street  interview.  Yeah.  With just regular Americans.  And they go, why does the rest of the world hate us so much?  Just turn on my super sweet 16.  I'm sure that's on a 24 hour loop in the Middle East.  That's their propaganda film.  You know how here they'll play like Al Qaeda?  They'll play the Al Qaeda chief sitting there going like, and we must destroy the infidels. 
[00:07:30]  And we watch and go, God damn, these sons of bitches.  I just want to bomb them.  I want to nuke them into the stone age again.  Right.  They play my super sweet 16 and they're just like, oh, Allah, praise me, Allah, we must  destroy these people.  The decadence.  Because it's what people hate this country about.  That's why they hate this country.  My super sweet 16.  But a lot of the kids on there are foreigners. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, you notice that?  A lot of Asian girls.  Well, Asian, Indian.  Indian, yeah.  It's the oil money.  Because it's the money.  Yeah, the parents have to be rich.  It's the oil money.  Show's not interesting if, you know, the father's coming out of the trailer giving the daughter  a Schwinn bicycle.  That's what I, I had my daughter's sweet 16.  Oh.  See, this is why we're going down this road right away because I just casually mentioned  that before the show and Rich goes, hey, I just gave my little daughter a sweet  16 party.  So I want to compare.  I want to compare.  Because Rich is now.  What we watch. 
[00:08:30]  You know, he's nationally known and stuff.  So you must have thrown a hell of a party for your daughter, huh?  I rented the firehouse hall.  The firehouse.  Did you really have it at a firehouse?  Oh, Jesus.  I debated and I argued with the guy, you know, about the air conditioning.  I said, if you don't turn on the air conditioning, do I get a deal, you know, to cut it down?  We had it at the firehouse.  You know, we had, you know, some of the.  That's wonderful.  Can I, can I, I think we have a little of that.  That's the one where he did perform.  Happy birthday to you. 
[00:09:00]  Happy birthday to.  All right.  Hold on, sweetie.  Let them leave.  Kids, get out of the way.  Get out of the way.  All right.  Happy birthday.  No, not yet.  All right.  No, schnookums.  Don't cry.  It's your big day.  But there's a fire.  A firehouse.  Hey, we should play some.  Let's play some audio from the latest My Super Sweet 16. 
[00:09:30]  It was Divya and Purya.  What?  Oh, the double one?  Yeah, Divya and Purya.  The twins.  Where are they?  They were two dot heads.  Jesus.  Two dot heads in Texas.  I think they're called Indians.  Although that is confusing, too.  Yeah, there's a few different kinds of Indians, so you've got to call them dot heads.  Yeah.  Then you get people upset that you're using that as a slur.  No, their website is Indian dot dot com. 
[00:10:00]  Did you just write that one?  Yeah.  All right.  You better write that down.  You're going to need that one on the stage.  Inappropriate bell.  On the stage at the ONA Traveling Virus.  All right.  So here's the intro with Divya and Purya.  Yeah.  And then we'll go to Rich Voss and see what he did.  Okay.  That's comparable to what's going on in this clip of My Super Sweet 16.  Hi, nice to meet you.  I'm Priya.  I'm 15 years old.  I think I look really good.  Divya is my sister. 
[00:10:30]  She's 18 years old.  And she's like my best friend.  We do everything together.  Sister.  We live in Beaumont, Texas.  It's like a really small town outside of Houston.  There's like nothing here.  Beaumont is like a poor mom.  Here we go.  My family is like one of the richest families in this town.  We have our private jets.  We both have cars.  This car says a lot about my personality.  It's elegant and it's like the coolest thing you could ever get. 
[00:11:00]  But we only have our permits.  I'm the only one in America that's 18 that has a belly and that still doesn't have a license yet.  And this is why they hate us right here.  So this is...  You notice the cadence in everything they say.  And we got a private jet.  And like I'm the youngest one in America.  Did you watch this one?  Jesus.  Did you watch this one? 
[00:11:30]  No, I missed this one.  They want to be Paris Hilton.  They're dot heads that want to be Paris Hilton.  Indians.  We're ruining the world.  They want to be Paris.  You'll hear the Paris Hilton cadence.  Yeah.  You'll hear...  That's what it is.  You'll hear the stupidity.  When they get their hair done for their Super Sweet 16 party, they...  Get my herded.  They want the Paris Hilton hair for the big event.  Are they blonde?  No.  Uh-oh.  No, they're, you know...  Can you even bleach that hair?  Huh?  Because it's so black, so dark. 
[00:12:00]  Their hair is so poor and so black.  No, they're sand...  Yeah, I understand.  The curvy residue won't come out of their hair.  So this family has a private jet.  What does your family have?  See, we got to compare here.  A minivan.  A minivan.  All right, a minivan.  She has a Bentley.  What does your daughters have?  What does my daughters have?  Well, they don't have a car yet because they're only 16, right?  Yeah.  Hey, what? 
[00:12:30]  A Sweet 16?  They give them cars.  Yeah, did you give...  A car at 16?  You didn't give your little daughter a car?  A car?  A car.  It's a Sweet 16.  That's like what the parents are supposed to do is get their kid a car.  No, no, no.  No.  Not only did I not get her a car, I told her to find a ride to the party.  You wouldn't even drive her.  See, that's got...  I mean...  You stink.  Well, we're obviously having fun with this, but it's got to suck for the parents in America  that their kids are watching.  Watching this. 
[00:13:00]  Watching.  And then they're 16...  They're turning 16, and their party's coming, and they're probably assuming a lot.  Down in the paneled basement.  Right.  And instead of in some nice banquet hall or in the backyard where they build a tent and  the helicopters are flying above, throwing rose petals among the partygoers...  You got this.  It's in a firehouse.  Oh, wait, Rich.  The fire truck has to get through first.  No. 
[00:13:30]  They just came back.  It was a false alarm.  Party continue.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jim in Mississippi.  Jim, real fast.  Go.  Hi, boys.  Don't ask Voss.  We got his daughter at BMW off of eBay.  Yeah, you didn't get any cars off eBay or nothing like that, huh?  What was the big gift, Rich?  Well, I threw her to party.  I paid for the party.  You know, that was kind of, you know, expensive.  But you have to give her a present.  Yeah, that's the whole gift there.  All right, so you can't afford a really nice car, but what did you give her?  Well, I was going to give her a, what do you call the, what are those, you know, the 
[00:14:00]  little Walkmans, and she didn't want...  An iPod.  So I gave it to Norton for his birthday when I was in here.  Is that the one he's bitching about?  Who, Norton?  Is that the one Norton's bitching about?  Was it an iPod or was it a MP3 player?  No, it was the little...  What are those called?  Nano.  Oh, the Nano.  Oh, the Nano?  Yeah.  Your daughter didn't want the Nano?  No, no, I gave her, what did I give her?  I gave her like, you know, I gave her some money or something to buy some...  Oh, money, that's good.  That's a nice personal loving gift from Dad.  You have no idea what's, you got her.  We have audio of Rich's daughter. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  After the party.  Goddamn Rich!  Boss!  Goddamn Rich!  Boss!  She really originally wanted me to have the party in a hotel in New York, you know, rent  out a hotel room.  Well, yeah.  Not a room, you know, a ballroom.  She goes, can we get a hotel in New York?  You know, and then rent a bus to bring all the... or something to bring all her friends  in.  Because you last-minuted this, didn't you?  No, well, I just said, look, I'll fund a lot of it, you know, and I...  Fund a lot of it. 
[00:15:00]  I said to my...  You know, I said to my wife, look, if I put the money up, you could, you know, do the  decorations.  We did our own decorations.  I'll bring some streamers and crepe paper.  It was, but when you were 16, did you go to a lot of Sweet 16?  No, it wasn't the thing to do back then.  No, MTV has made it the thing now.  Yeah, I mean, sure, you heard about Sweet 16 your whole lives, but now it's really, really  popular.  They become like weddings at 16 years old.  Let's go to Mike on Long Island.  Mike, go ahead. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, I was wondering if Rich's daughter got a chance to slide down the fire pole at the  firehouse.  Practicing for the future that Rich is going to drive her to?  Yeah, I made her wear a little cowboy outfit.  So it was at the firehouse.  You guys put up your own decorations.  You didn't have a party planner.  It was a beach theme.  And here's the horrible thing, too, is I had to cancel work that week.  Oh, wow.  So it cost you money.  Luckily, I got a late gig that night where I got to leave the party and then still go  do a late spot. 
[00:16:00]  And the dress, Bonnie went and bought her a dress for the thing.  Bonnie, you got her the dress for her Sweet 16?  Of course.  She's the responsible one.  You two girls go out shopping.  We went out to the mall.  Just a couple of girls out looking for a dress.  Did you try on a few and you kind of went?  Yeah, no, that's not quite it.  Well, before...  That's a big part of the Sweet 16 TV show.  For Rich and my wedding, I took the girls to buy dresses and apparently I got them too 
[00:16:30]  slutty of dresses.  Too slutty?  My ex-wife made them back.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah, it's nothing you want out of your wedding than 16-year-old breasts popping out and poor  dresses.  They're hot.  Anything you put on these girls, they look good.  Do you have any recent pictures of your daughters?  Well, yeah.  Not only the Bonnie...  Because I've only seen like little ones from years ago.  Then I bought a bathing suit when we went to L.A. and they said juicy on the butt.  And the mom wouldn't let them wear those either.  Of course. 
[00:17:00]  There's nothing worse than walking around.  And I've seen younger than 16 walking around wearing juicy on their ass.  Is that wrong?  That guy...  Wow.  I was like, you're not going to have these bodies forever.  Let's, you know, let's mess it up.  Most of the women that wear like juicy wear, there's an old bit, but...  Yeah, I've seen the one of your...  Let me see.  Let me see.  Look at his daughter there.  They have no business wearing juicy...  Jesus.  He always does that.  You ask him for a picture of anything and Rich will hand you a picture of himself 
[00:17:30]  in a state of, let's say, arousal.  Are my daughter...  They're a good looking kid.  Thanks, Rich.  I'm looking at two very beautiful girls, Rich.  Amazing.  They're like models.  They're really very attractive.  Yeah, very pretty.  One almost has a Scarlett Johansson look.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  The younger one.  Is that the younger one over there?  Who's Scarlett Johansson?  Who's Scarlett Johansson?  Let me see.  Forget it.  Just give up.  Scarlett Johansson is an actress that every guy in America wants to be. 
[00:18:00]  Every guy should know who it is.  Every guy should know who that is.  How do you get such cute daughters?  His ex-wife is really attractive.  She's beautiful.  I never saw his ex.  Yeah, is she?  You don't have a picture hard.  This is the one that you just showed Opie.  In my mind when I'm having sex with Bonnie.  Oh, my God.  By the way, Bonnie, next time just try a gun in your mouth pulling the trigger because I 
[00:18:30]  see you've obviously tried to slit your wrist being with Rich Voss.  She's wearing a big bandage on her wrist and all I can think is she's finally tried to  kill herself after living with Rich.  The awkward wrist bandage.  I got a tattoo of...  Boy, I wonder what happened.  You got a tat?  A tat of Rich's privates.  Oh, great.  Actual size.  And that's it.  It's the very small bandage.  No, I burnt myself making him dare.  My ex-wife trashed her at the basketball game for cooking.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:19:00]  For cooking?  Yeah, she was like, oh, don't try cooking.  I never did that.  Yeah, no wonder you're the ex-wife.  You know what she said?  She goes, there's things he'd appreciate more.  Oh, you know what's amazing?  That he still has a relationship with his ex-wife.  Well, he has to.  I guess you have to for the kids.  Yeah, but there's a lot of couples out there.  They get divorced and they don't have that relationship and they say, screw it.  Yeah.  We'll have separate lives.  We have kids, but it's separate lives.  Kids get dropped off at a neutral location.  Exactly.  Like the ransom.  Right, exactly.  And then just one other person picks him up.  I don't want to see anybody. 
[00:19:30]  None of your friends.  Nothing else.  Just drop the kids off and leave.  She's actually good because, you know, Rich is a nightmare.  I love that coming from his wife.  No, but she, like, he'll call and be like, where are they?  I said six o'clock.  You know, he gets really angry.  She's like, I'm coming.  Like, she's so calm about it.  She cleans our house.  What?  She has a cleaning business sometimes.  And you're one of her clients?  Yeah.  Wait, your ex-wife cleans your house?  Not well.  Why would she clean it well?  Yeah.  She does a great job. 
[00:20:00]  She's brilliant.  Your life is messed up, man.  I have a similar situation.  My ex-wife cleaned me out.  All right.  You want to hear another clip from my super sweet 16?  Of course.  They're all adorable.  We also did centerpieces at my daughter's party.  Oh, yeah?  Ah, for all the tables.  Yep.  Candy.  And we put, like, some olipops in those Lick-A-Made things.  That's great.  For a 10-year-old party. 
[00:20:30]  They're 16.  There was no alcohol.  Nobody showed up drunk.  It was actually pretty amazing.  No?  Because I kept thinking, when I was 16, I was little.  Yeah, drinking all the time, trying to slip your booze into anything, Kool-Aid.  You're out of touch, man.  The kids are into the pills.  Yeah, they're probably just all on E or X or whatever the hell.  They popped a few pills before they got there.  At 16?  Yeah, I guess I do that at 16.  I started a...  Before you play that quickly, I just have to address the fact that if Jim Norton was  here, he would be going off like a madman on the fact that you cannot even listen to 
[00:21:00]  what they're talking about because they have to throw so much music and sound effect clips  on top of these girls talking to hold your attention for two seconds on MTV.  Because it's garbage TV.  It's garbage and there's nothing but...  You've got to spice it up with music and sound effects.  A lot of music, quick clips, sound effects.  Just play the goddamn show.  This is my fabulous tennis court.  Yeah, and this is where the party's going to happen.  The tent has to be from here all the way down there. 
[00:21:30]  It has to look really expensive.  How much do you think this stuff will cost?  You're probably getting close to $20,000.  Daddy likes that.  Yeah, shut up.  $20,000 for what?  I just want to smack these kids.  Smack them.  Was that $20,000 for one thing or the whole party?  $20,000 just for the tent.  Just for the tent.  That's it.  No.  Yeah.  Okay, I was wondering...  The music was too friggin' loud for me to understand.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  No, because... 
[00:22:00]  What the hell is that?  Turn it down.  Well, because this is the jewelry now.  I have this amazing dress that I'm wearing tonight.  I look like an Indian t-shirt.  Our outfits are custom made from India.  And I got all the diamond jewelry made especially for tonight.  What do you want to see?  They make me look gorgeous.  Made especially for tonight.  That's great.  See, they're trying to be Paris Hilton.  You hear their voices?  Yeah.  Little five-year-old children sewed this for hours and hours for just three cents.  And in Jah... 
[00:22:30]  So whatever.  That's just...  Awful.  That's just a little taste.  Diamond jewelry.  Yeah, diamonds.  Kids wear diamonds at 16.  Did you get your daughter a little piece of jewelry?  A little rock, a little ice.  To remember the big day?  Maybe a little necklace?  What did you get her?  She wanted her belly button pierced.  I told her she can't do that.  What are you talking about?  16.  A lot of girls have their belly button pierced at 16.  Yeah, they have more than that pierced at 16.  You don't give them their freedoms and...  She's not allowed to have juicy on her bathing suit.  Well, that's a little...  Belly button pierced.  A little much.  You know guys just could be gawking at her at the pool or... 
[00:23:00]  She's got a pool in her backyard.  Where's she going to go?  Yeah, but you don't wear...  I mean, I could see her point not wearing juicy, you know, if you're wearing your bathing suit.  I could see if it said juicy, like J-E-W, because, you know, kind of be proud of your religion.  Oh, Jew-y, like kind of, eh.  Hey, uh...  Jew-y.  A couple quick calls, then we'll move on.  Andrea from New York, what's up?  Hey, what's up to you guys?  Hey. 
[00:23:30]  Hi.  Hi.  I was talking about divorce earlier.  My parents were so evil from each other.  My dad, who was paying house payments for our house, was like, wouldn't even be allowed in the house.  He had to wait in the car.  Oh, yeah.  That's exactly what we were saying.  It was like dropping the kids off like ransom.  Yeah.  Like a ransom drop.  My parents, my father would come see us like every couple weeks.  And when your parents are divorced, like the father would try...  Like, I would curse on my mother.  Then my father would come, right? 
[00:24:00]  He'd walk in the room, I was sleeping, he'd wake me up by hitting me and smacking me.  Then he'd curse at me.  Do you have any crime?  Then he'd give me a lecture, right?  Then he'd take me out to eat, then give me money and leave, right?  He did everything in one visit, right?  And so after a while, you know, sometimes my mother, my father would come out, but my mother would set him up.  Like, we'd be waiting.  Hey, we haven't seen my father in a couple weeks.  And he'd get there.  My mother would have cops waiting and have him arrested for not paying child support.  You know, so kids sitting in the window. 
[00:24:30]  Was he deadbeat dad?  Well, so who's worse?  Your father...  And they wonder why you start smoking crack years later.  I know.  Just get rid of the pain.  One year later.  Yeah, one year later, right?  Or your mother would take you to your grandmother's and just leave you at the doorstep and go,  I can't handle these guys.  And you take them.  No abandonment issues.  Wow.  You know, nowadays you call your mom and say, hey, can you watch kids?  My mother would just take us, leave us there.  Not going to go, I can't handle them.  You take them.  I don't want them. 
[00:25:00]  Hey, thanks.  Your mom's still around, right?  Yeah.  How old is she?  Like 77.  So she's getting up to that age where you could finally drop her off somewhere and go, I can't.  Pay back some kids.  That's right.  We are in a nursing home.  Just drop her off at the stoop at the front steps of the nursing home.  Not even bring her in.  Hey, parents, realize this.  We get the final word.  The last laugh.  The last laugh.  Hey, Jessica in Florida, what do you got?  We got to take a break here.  I'm inviting my friend Jessica.  Well, I have the opinion that I can't even watch it anymore. 
[00:25:30]  I used to try to watch it, and I just can't take it anymore because the girl's behavior,  it just really makes me so mad because I remember my 16th birthday, and I didn't get, you know,  a big party or, you know, a car or anything like that.  I felt lucky if I got, like, the best thing for my birthday.  99% of, at least 99% of the women in America get nothing big for their sweet 16.  I got a yacht. 
[00:26:00]  I watched that show to be pissed off.  There's a lot of TV shows out there I watch to get pissed off.  You want to reach in and smack them in the head.  Right.  Yeah, I mean, the highlight of my 16th birthday was my mother finally decided I was old enough  to buy me those novelty cards that have the half-naked men on them.  That's it?  That was the most quality thing I got.  Did you use those cards later on in the evening?  No, no.  No?  It was one of those cards.  Girls don't know how to do anything.  Right.  If I got my hands at 16 on a set of those cards with the naked ladies, oh, forget it. 
[00:26:30]  You wouldn't be able to play with those cards.  It'd just be a staggered.  It wouldn't even be cards anymore.  It would be a brick.  Paperweight.  Paperweight.  Yeah, you're all confused.  You're like, it looks like 52 cards, but I keep counting them, and I only count 18.  They're very thick cards.  Right.  Whose pimply ass is that, E-Rock?  No.  Lindsay Lohan.  That's Lindsay Lohan's pimply ass? 
[00:27:00]  E-Rock finds the greatest websites while we're doing the radio show.  Of course he does.  You've got to check this out.  We'll take a break.  What was it doing on a wrestling site?  What the heck is that?  Is that mosquito bites?  She's bending all the way over, and of course the paparazzi's right there to capture it.  They get everything on her.  There's like bug bites and all sorts of stuff on her upper back thigh.  Bruises.  They're saying it's bruises?  Oh, boy.  Looks like she got hit with something across the back of her upper thigh.  All right.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:27:30]  We've got Rich Voss and Bonnie in studio today for Jim Norton.  Jim Norton's down at Zaney's in Nashville all weekend long, so if you're in that area  and you're looking for some great comedy, make sure you check out Jimmy.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony are back.  Vincent's going to tell us what he learned this summer.  I spent three weeks with my Uncle Anthony, and I learned a lot from listening to his radio  program.  First of all, women on the radio stink on ice, and all holes should be banned from the airwaves.  Next, it's good to live amongst the Jews. 
[00:28:00]  They have all the money, so they have nice houses, and the crime rates are low.  Opie's name is first because he saved my uncle from blue-collar hell.  Jimmy is a good egg, but I'm not allowed to be alone with him.  Opie and Anthony!  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  ONA Uncut and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The show continues during the commercial breaks, I'll tell you that much. 
[00:28:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show, the ONA virus spreading across America.  We've got Rich Voss and his lovely wife, Bonnie McFarlane, in studio.  They're playing Carolines here in New York City all weekend long.  Very, very funny.  Very funny.  It's going to be some fine shows all weekend long at Carolines.  For tickets, 212-757-4100.  Thank you.  Who canceled?  Thank you.  Tracy Morgan.  Why do you got to be mean?  It doesn't matter.  No one will ever leave Rich Voss' show. 
[00:29:00]  No, I'm telling you.  Saying they had a bad time.  We beat the hell out of Rich on the radio, but the fact is he does a great job on the stage.  Always rave reviews.  All right.  You want to do the guy's gun wild?  Or do you want to do the grand old sex party?  Grand old sex party.  Let's do this really fast and then we'll get into the Logo Network, the gay channel.  There's a gay channel for everything, you know. 
[00:29:30]  And Cablevision carries this channel called Logo, and it's all gay programming.  I found it just flipping through the channels, mind you, and they had an award show on.  It was the GLAAD Awards, and I was watching that, and they were giving awards, you know,  and everything.  I think Brokeback Mountain won everything.  It was nominated, only film nominated, only film that won everything.  Can you get this channel in Jersey?  I mean, like if you were, you know, home alone or something.  I don't know.  If not, just go to a rest stop. 
[00:30:00]  Same thing.  Same programming.  Go to a rest stop, bathroom, and just go, psst, and you're tuned into Logo.  Hey, buddy.  Was there even another gay movie out there that even had a chance?  No.  Does anyone know the answer to this?  No.  Brokeback Mountain had to be the only gay movie.  It swept everything.  What do you mean?  Because it was fabulous.  I'm talking about like one, a quality film.  Was there a second movie? 
[00:30:30]  I think there was something where.  Capote?  What's his name?  Yeah, Capote, very good.  Capote was nominated.  There was also some other movie that got accolades.  Yeah, but the Capote movie, which was great, had nothing to do with his gayness.  Nah, a little bit.  Not really.  A little bit.  Did you see Capote?  Yeah.  It was pretty good.  It was really good.  I didn't see Brokeback Mountain.  No.  No, I saw the Brokeback.  Brokeback Mountain, before it came, like six months earlier, we were in the theater, Bonnie  and I, and they were showing coming attractions, and we were laughing out loud. 
[00:31:00]  We were laughing.  We were going.  So immature.  We were laughing.  And we were going, no one's going to go see this movie.  Yeah, see.  Boy, were we wrong.  I predicted their careers were over.  I go, boy, this is the end for this.  Like, why would they do this?  Well, then they just went into doing every manly role they could find, you know?  Right.  I want to play a garbage man.  I don't care what it is.  I need to play a truck driver.  Next movie.  A gladiator in Harlem.  Yeah. 
[00:31:30]  But, all right, we'll get into the logo channel in a minute here.  Ooh, goody.  And our own Sam has to watch the logo channel.  Rich is on TV.  Oh, sorry.  That's a horse.  That was really bad.  Sorry.  That's a horse, Anthony.  Sorry.  That's a nice horsey.  And his teeth aren't as big as they used to be.  Of course not.  I had them filed down.  Yeah, we noticed.  Okay, here we go.  A quick story, then we'll get into the logo thing.  And we have Sam.  He's one of the newer members of the opening after show, behind-the-scenes guy. 
[00:32:00]  And he's a little man on the totem pole, so we gave him the job of watching the logo  channel every night.  Doesn't he look like a Dr. Seuss character?  Sam, you know, is related to Thomas Jefferson.  He's traced his genealogy back.  He's related to Thomas Jefferson.  Now, you know what Thomas Jefferson did?  Had some sex with the slaves.  Yeah.  We are certain that there is some black in him.  He is the whitest black guy ever. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, we challenge people all the time.  Like, you send in a whiter black guy than our own Sam, and we'll give you a prize.  He insists he's not black.  But he's hairy.  Of course he's black.  He's got hair.  And there's just something feature-wise.  But not like, he doesn't have black features, but there's something feature-wise that conjures  up a black guy.  His brow is awfully blacky.  And he walks around here pretending he's working.  But the hair is what really clinches it.  Very kinky.  What about the thumbs?  We learned that yesterday. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Look at this thumb.  Look at his thumbs.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Look at his size.  It's the size of the rest of his fingers.  It really is.  He's got very large face features.  What God took from Rich, he gave to him in thumbs.  You can tell he's far black because he always does.  He'll look at you.  Then he'll do a side profile.  Oh.  I believe that's part of a photo thing.  Oh.  So, oh, look.  He just got angry with you. 
[00:33:30]  Some of that white rage coming out.  He got a little uppity.  Just a little, though.  Just a little.  He doesn't get much.  Just a tiny bit of uppity.  So, Sam, how's it going watching the logo channel for the Opie and Anthony show?  It's great.  I mean, I just feel lucky that I'm the one that has the cable provider that actually has the channel.  Yeah, you won't find it on, like, Time Warner.  No, but.  No, you.  Or anything.  It's on Cablevision out on Long Island.  Anthony discovered the logo channel.  And then in one of our meetings, he's like, all right, we've got to keep an eye on this because there's some crazy stuff going on on the logo channel. 
[00:34:00]  So, who has it?  And we all kind of just looked down.  Everyone got looked down at him.  I don't.  I've never seen it.  I have no idea.  It's not there.  And Sam is trying to, you know, get noticed and possibly hired by us.  So, of course, his hand is, like, up in the air.  I got it.  He'll do anything to become, you know, a paid member of the show.  One of the players.  So, now it's his job to watch.  Yeah.  And then he sends emails to everybody what he has found on the logo channel.  The thing that struck me with the channel was a huge hog. 
[00:34:30]  No, it.  The thing that struck me was the fact that it's so overtly gay.  Like, you know how Lifetime is the channel for women and it's so just overtly pro-woman?  Like, every movie on Lifetime is Marky Post meeting the perfect guy who halfway through the movie beats the crap out of her.  And then our friends help, like, kill him or something and it all ends up happy because the man is dead. 
[00:35:00]  That's how covertly gay the logo is.  Like, everything has to be gay.  It can't just be – why can't it just be the gay guy living a completely just normal life?  Him going to work, him doing this.  It's got to be, like, one of the series they have, there's these four gay guys and it's just them.  It's like Sex in the City with four guys having sex with guys everywhere.  That's all they're doing.  Is it Noah's Ark?  Noah's Ark.  I'm starting to know the names of these programs. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  Is it Noah's Ark?  Yeah.  I think we got the trailer for that.  Noah's Ark.  It's too gay for Bravo.  It is really gay.  Can't get enough Noah?  Oh, my God.  All right, hold on.  Let me get this on here for us.  Can't get enough Noah?  Oh, my God.  Then get the complete first season of Noah's Ark on DVD.  Isn't that wild?  With over two hours of extras including unrated extended episodes of the original pilot and more.  Oh, I want in on this one.  Me too.  Into leather.  Why not?  Order now and get this exclusive Noah's Ark leather wristband. 
[00:36:00]  Now it's getting juicy.  Noah's Ark.  Get the DVD and the leather wristband for just $34.98.  Plus, you're being handled.  Call 1-866-551-LOGO.  Hey, just gave me a little commercial.  Or look online.com to order now.  Nah, there's not much there.  You can't parody that sort of thing.  No.  That's like...  If you're wearing that leather wristband, that Noah's Ark leather wristband, that was  just...  That's got to be like a signal.  Hello.  You're tagged.  When you order it, the mailman comes and throws it on your back. 
[00:36:30]  Anyway, so...  Well, now we've got to play Guys Gone Wild.  Noah's Ark.  You know, in the old days of radio, this would be a parody commercial.  Yeah.  You know, the morning zoos and stuff would play this like they're goofing on Girls Gone  Wild, but...  Who hasn't seen that?  But this is the real deal.  It's Guys Gone Wild?  Yeah.  And it really does sound exactly like a parody.  Who hasn't seen the Girls Gone Wild commercial?  Everybody's seen it.  You know what it is.  They show the girls.  They put little censor things over their bosoms and their lower region, and they did 
[00:37:00]  dance around and do their little kissing and Girls Gone Wild flashing thing.  I watch the infomercial every morning when I get up at 4.30.  The same exact half hour infomercial.  It's just awful.  And then, you know, they've run out of ideas.  The Girls Gone Wild Island, where the girls will compete for the...  Now they're running on like logs and they're naked.  Anything that makes things bounce on them.  Yeah, they're doing chin-ups. 
[00:37:30]  They just run out of things to do.  We're going to have a trampoline bouncing competition.  Fantastic.  Watch them cook naked.  Right.  They could burn a boob.  Like, anything to try to rope you in.  The whole...  What's that...  Girls Gone Wild trying to get paid for this.  For the...  Oh, God.  That was a bad one.  Now...  Yes, I will.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They, uh...  They've completely run out of ideas.  But they keep selling.  And the thing is, if you... 
[00:38:00]  You can't just buy one of those things.  I've heard about it.  I didn't order it.  But I've heard from people that did.  And that sounds like an excuse.  But I really didn't.  It's such...  It's such garbage.  You get a bit of porno on the computer.  But, uh...  If you order one, you're kind of subscribed to Girls Gone Wild.  And they keep sending you new ones that they then bill you for.  You have to send it back in order to not be billed for it.  It's like a subscriber-based thing, like Columbia House Records or something like that. 
[00:38:30]  So they have to keep coming up with new ones to keep sending out to people.  So it's a never-ending chain of Girls Gone Wild.  So they've run out of situations.  The one where it's Girls Gone Wild, they put them in an airport.  I swear to you.  An airplane that is normally called the Vomit Comet.  It's what astronauts use to simulate zero gravity.  They go up.  They go into an arc and into a dive.  And the plane is pretty much falling around you.  So you're falling at the same speed of the plane. 
[00:39:00]  So it simulates weightlessness.  They have nude girls.  Weightless.  Flying around, banging into the side.  That's the latest Girls Gone Wild?  That's the newest Girls Gone Wild.  Weightless girls.  So you see their boobs and everything in zero gravity as they smash into the walls of an  aircraft.  They've run out of ideas.  I think that's a good one.  That sounds like a fun one.  It's creative.  Yeah, why not?  But then, yeah, Logo decided, you know, there's a market on their channel for Guys Gone Wild.  Now, you would think it would be like porno, where there'd be girls and guys going at it. 
[00:39:30]  But it is strictly guys.  And it's the same themed thing, where it's guys flashing, and then they kind of pair off  and go at it with each other.  Wait, you've seen this commercial?  I've seen the commercial on Logo.  I thought you only saw Logo for a few minutes.  You know, I might have been tuned in longer than I really thought.  Either that or they really whip through these shows and commercials pretty quickly. 
[00:40:00]  They play during the commercial breaks, during the GLAAD Awards, they play like every promo  and promo of every show and commercial that they run, because I guess they don't have a lot of commercials.  What does GLAAD stand for?  The Gay and Lesbian Alliance for Advocates for Gay Things.  In order for you to see commercials, you were watching the gay awards. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, because I saw an awards show, so I stopped, and then I realized, oh, it's the gay and lesbian awards.  So I better watch this.  Two hours later, I realized, oh, this is the gay channel.  Right.  It was like a gay guy that hosted it.  I don't know.  Two hours later, I'm thinking, something's not right here.  Something's missing.  Me and Tommy said, let's turn this off.  All right, so Sam, we're going to just play the audio here, but what's the video all about?  You've got to paint the picture for the listeners out there. 
[00:41:00]  It's like what Anthony says.  It's very similar to the Girls Gone Wild.  I would assume it's the same company.  The logos are the same.  The setup is the same.  It starts with a guy kind of teasing you by pulling down his boxer briefs just a little bit.  He really doesn't have an African-American voice at all, does he?  No.  No.  Very Sammy.  White.  Just Sam.  Oh, by the way, someone's saying, find someone that's a whiter black guy than Sam.  They say Tiger Woods.  No.  You guys have no idea. 
[00:41:30]  No.  We are talking white-black when we talk about Sam.  Like, his skin tone is probably whiter than me, and I'm up there on the white scale.  But it's the features that come with the really white skin that is perplexing.  Tiger Woods is James Evans compared to our own Sam.  Believe me.  Same.  Maybe we could do a whole thing on the website, opiananthony.com.  We got a picture of Sam, and then we challenge our listeners to take the photos of their friends 
[00:42:00]  that they think might be a whiter black guy than Sam.  Ain't going to happen.  It's not going to happen.  I put all my money that no one can ever find a whiter black guy.  We win.  All right.  So the video is guys teasing with their boxers, and then what else they're saying?  Yeah.  And then they, well, I don't want to spoil too much of it, because you can tell a lot,  but they start putting it in situations.  Putting it in situations?  Or putting certain situations out there where two fellas might go wild with each other.  Yeah.  Go wild.  Hence the go wild. 
[00:42:30]  You know, the gay and lesbian movies that I'm looking at here on this list I was just handed,  but they're stealing some regular movies, I think.  Well, we were just handed the gay, lesbian, 1980 through present, movies that primarily  deal with homosexual themes or where the main characters are gay, and it's the top-grossing  films of all time or since 1980?  Top-grossing gay, lesbian films of all time.  What do you think?  Well, because before 1980, you couldn't throw a gay film out there, so this is the beginning  of time for the gays and the lesbians, 1980. 
[00:43:00]  1980, you want to go top ten?  Monster.  Monster.  Yeah, remember that one?  That was with Charlize, where she dressed up all ugly.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, serial killer.  Out of the top ten, I saw four of them.  You did.  I think I've seen them all.  It makes you buy.  Let me think. 
[00:43:30]  No, you've seen more than four.  Saw it.  Saw it.  Saw it.  Didn't say it.  Didn't say it.  Saw it.  Didn't say it.  Didn't say it.  Saw it.  Saw five.  That's right.  I saw five.  Five.  All right.  So it was Monster in tenth place.  Two Wong Fu.  Thanks for everything.  Julie Newmar.  Didn't say it.  Ninth place.  The Hours.  Eighth place.  Didn't say it.  The Crying Game.  I saw that.  Seventh place.  In-N-Out.  In-N-Out.  What was In-N-Out?  What?  He's a teenager.  Oh, right.  Oh, crap. 
[00:44:00]  I saw that one, too.  Uh-oh.  Six.  No, I'm up to five.  I'm tied with you.  You said six.  I said five.  You said five before In-N-Out.  No, I said four before that.  You said five.  Okay.  Did you go out tonight?  Fifth place, Philadelphia.  Fourth place, the talented Mr. Ripley.  That was gay?  Yeah, it was Matt Damon and Jude Law, right?  There was a little thing going on between those two.  And then Brokeback Mountain was in third place. 
[00:44:30]  Interview with the vampire.  And The Birdcage.  The Birdcage, of course.  With Nathan Lane and who else?  Robin Williams.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was fabulous.  The top grossing gay film of all time.  The Birdcage.  Hey, we've got to play Sam's theme song really fast.  Can we play it?  Is there anything in here we can play?  Well, XM's going to get pissed.  We'll play the real version over there.  Oh, I had a good line and someone stepped on it? 
[00:45:00]  Oh, really?  Jesus.  This is very rare.  Anthony in Vegas, what's up?  Yeah, you guys missed Opie's line.  Anthony was glad he said, gay and lesbian AIDS are doomed.  And I really was laughing really hard.  It wasn't that good of a line.  I found that offensive.  I was almost there.  But thank you, Anthony.  I appreciate it.  Here's Sam's theme song.  We had a bleep out a word here, and it's going to piss off people. 
[00:45:30]  We'll explain later on next time.  Lighten up, Francis.  This is Sam's theme song, Rich.  Sam's not black.  His ancestor's Thomas Jefferson.  He's not black.  He doesn't have big lips, just a real big thong.  Well, his skin's kind of weird.  It's not black or white.  If he's white, then he's dark. 
[00:46:00]  If he's black, he's light.  Who the hell can figure?  Who the hell can figure?  If Sam's white or an ****, white or an ****, then we're teasing, you know.  Because he's white with an afro.  Sam's not black.  He's not black.  Don't smoke crack.  He ain't black.  There you go.  And Sam's got a theme song he's in.  And unfortunately, the lawyers don't like that word right now.  We're fighting them on it.  Not here. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, well, at XM, they still love that word.  Of course.  They use it around the office in Washington.  That's the beauty of working for two companies.  Oh, XM can't get enough of that word.  Yeah.  All right, so here's Guys Got Wild.  Thanks to Sam, who's watching the Logo Channel 24 hours a day.  Self-sacrificing guy.  Here it is.  I don't know what you want to see. 
[00:47:00]  Are you ready for...  We've traveled the world to find the wildest parties packed with the sexiest guys alive.  These are real college guys who love to go wild and get naked.  Don't miss one second of the action on six of the hottest DVDs ever made, including Heatstroke, Big Easy, and Dude, Where's My Pants?  Want to see what really happens when frat boys get together, let loose, and show off their young, rock-hard bodies?  Follow the action from the beach back to the hotel where anything goes. 
[00:47:30]  I'm sorry for guys on that.  Guys Gone Wild.  It's all real, raw, and totally uncensored.  Get the video people just can't stop talking about.  Order Guys Gone Wild now.  People?  People are saying?  Well.  There you go.  And, boy, the audio just doesn't do it justice.  No.  Oh, the video is just unwatchable as a heterosexual.  Because they want to...  They watch it, and, yeah, they're, like, pulling down their shorts just about at the line where they couldn't show anything else on television. 
[00:48:00]  And then they're back at the hotel, and a guy is showering.  Yeah, I'm in the shower.  Guy's Gone Wild.  Are ya?  They want to show the frat guys.  Yeah.  Going Wild, like they mentioned.  Yeah.  They're showing a bunch of frat guys on a beach doing homoerotic games and stuff.  Yeah, they're, like, wrestling with each other.  That's right, there was a little wrestling match going on between two guys.  Wow.  Guy's Gone Wild.  This is what's happening on Logo. 
[00:48:30]  There you go.  All right, Sam, thank you.  Thank you, Sam.  My pleasure.  There, Sam, he's this close to being hired.  So close.  So close.  He's been working for free for...  When did you start with us?  Over a year ago?  Yeah, I started, like, last June.  But then he went over to Scorch.  Well, then he went back to Syracuse to get his degree.  Syracuse, we're doing Scorch.  Then he was interning for Scorch, our old friend up there in Syracuse, who's now in,  what, Manchester, New Hampshire?  Stepping up a notch.  Scorch, kingdom of nakedness. 
[00:49:00]  And then...  Naked militia.  And then Sam came back to work for free some more, and we might just start throwing him  some money.  Wonderful.  All right, thanks, Sam.  Do we have Mantown commercials on this game channel?  On Logo?  Mantown.  Oh!  Watch Mantown residents wrestle nude.  All right, we've got to take a break.  Rich Voss and Bonnie in studio today.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Learn to play poker with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:49:30]  No!  Oh, God!  He spilled my chip.  I'm sorry, sir.  Now clean it up!  That's right.  Be a poker player, just like your father.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Are you happy now, Opie?  Are you happy?  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:50:00]  That's right.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Rich Voss and Bonnie in studio today.  Bonnie McFarlane, her stage name.  Bonnie McFarlane Voss.  Hyphen Voss.  Are you a hyphen?  No, I have two A's to do it.  All right.  A hyphen A's?  Well, they're going to be appearing at Caroline's all this weekend here in New York City.  Very, very funny.  I was going to say funny guys.  Very funny comedians.  Tonight, Saturday, and Sunday for tickets 212-757-4100. 
[00:50:30]  Definitely worth checking out, okay?  Anthony.  He's coming in like crazy.  So, I got to read one of these.  Problem.  We were just talking about the Logo Channel, the Gay Channel, Guys Gone Wild, and Axel Rosenberg  from MySpace.  He writes, Anthony, you can't talk in great detail for 10 minutes in great detail about something  you watch and then say, it's totally unwatchable as a heterosexual. 
[00:51:00]  I can understand that.  I was doing show research as I watched it, but yeah, that does sound like a contradiction,  but you also got to understand.  Yeah.  It's not exactly always me watching these shows.  Well, we all know you have multiple personalities.  Multiple personalities.  There's a lot of voices that live in your head.  Creeping through my head.  And perhaps...  Another one of those personalities was actually watching...  Oh, I think I'm feeling a channeling coming through. 
[00:51:30]  I...  The Guys Gone Wild thing was not watched by Anthony, but it was watched by Andrew Dice Gay.  Is there a problem that I'm watching the Logo Channel?  It's fantastic.  With emphasis on the dick.  Fantastic.  I love the Logo Channel.  Yeah?  It makes me feel free and gay.  And I don't mean in a happy, old-timey way, gay. 
[00:52:00]  I mean, you know, gay.  What's wrong with The Guys Gone Wild?  College Guys Showing Each Other the Business.  Back in the hotel room.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Why are you backing off from the mic, Andrew Dice Gay?  So, uh, how are your grades this semester?  Yeah.  Pretty good.  Yeah.  Come over here. 
[00:52:30]  Hickory dickory dock.  Let's watch Logo and suck...  Oh!  So, you're enjoying the Logo Channel.  Jack P Nimble, Jack P Quick.  Yeah.  Turn on Logo and suck my...  Eglige!  So, uh, there's the answer there, Axl.  Yeah, I don't want to soak the place today. 
[00:53:00]  They're handing you paper towels as we do.  Thank you.  All right.  You make some mess everywhere.  Yeah, moving on.  Wet my pants.  This story made me laugh so hard today for many, many reasons.  Uh, grand old sex party.  Yes.  You were the one that pointed this out in the back office there, Anthony.  And then I read further, and there's just so much fodder in this story.  Uh, the father of Brooklyn-born U.S. Senator Norm Coleman was busted having sex in a car  outside a pizzeria, police said, yesterday. 
[00:53:30]  All right?  The father of a senator.  Usually it's the, uh, politician's kids that screw things up.  Right.  In this case...  Your old dad.  It's...  It's his father.  Norm Coleman, senior, 81.  God bless.  Right on, Grandma.  God bless.  81.  Model T was shaking.  Thank you, C. Allen.  Who used to run a small electronics business was caught at about 6.30 p.m. Tuesday in Minnesota 
[00:54:00]  after someone called cops to report people were having sex in a car.  81-year-old dude having sex in a car.  First of all, the first problem I have with this story, who's, who's calling the police  because they...  Leave them alone.  Leave them alone.  Let them have some fun.  81 years old, for the love of God.  Who's the buzzkill that, that is seeing, uh, sex in a car and calling the cops?  An 85-year-old man.  Yeah, yeah.  Can no longer do it.  This sucks. 
[00:54:30]  I go home to nothing.  This guy's got some 38-year-old broad in a car.  Yeah, she was 38.  Yeah, that's the, that's where the story gets great.  That's a chippy.  But I don't want to just go past that line really fast.  I mean...  You're just saying age difference is Rich and I.  Oh, no.  Oh.  Ooh, Bonnie nails you.  When you see, uh, you know, people having sex in a car, don't you get, like, psyched?  Like, all right, this is cool.  You're not calling the cops going, I'm seeing something, you know, wrong here, and you've 
[00:55:00]  got to get over here and arrest these people.  First of all, I never...  If I did see it, I would try to probably watch as much as I possibly...  Work your way into it.  Hey, man, when you work...  Excuse me.  When you work these hours, I haven't seen it recently, but I was up to, I think, what  was the last count?  Uh, three, three.  I saw, uh, uh, I saw three cars that were all fogged up.  You know, when I used to, like, skate to, to, to work and back, you see some great things  at 4.30 in the morning, and you see these, the car, the, the rap music is cranking, and 
[00:55:30]  the, the windows are all just fogged up, and you know what's going on in there.  Of course.  Every once in a while, you'll see, you know, uh, you know, a, a breast pop-up or something.  You get to see something cool.  I haven't seen it in a while, though.  But what can happen to you?  Like, what is the, what, you know, what's...  I don't know.  What's a crime?  I think it's, uh, illegal for some reason.  Yeah, if you want...  Why?  If you want to call the cops and be one.  Sex in public.  Yeah.  So, you know.  All right.  So, he's 81.  He got caught having sex in a car with a woman. 
[00:56:00]  Uh, her name's Patricia.  Uh, Patricia.  She's 38 years old.  I got a burp.  Sorry.  Uh, they were both charged, here's your answer, uh, Rich, with lewd and disorderly conduct.  Uh, Patricia told cops the elder Coleman, a World War II vet, is her boyfriend.  Nice!  What a guy.  43-year-old difference.  What a guy.  43 years between the two.  In a statement, Senator...  Brings her some silk stockings from France.  Did he do that?  World War II vet. 
[00:56:30]  Here you go, dame.  Nice set of stems on ya.  In a statement, Senator Coleman, uh, said he was upset by his father's arrest.  Oh, upset by his arrest.  Not what he was doing.  Why would you be upset?  Well, by the arrest.  Uh, just by the arrest part, you think?  No.  I love my father deeply, Coleman said.  I do not condone his actions or behavior.  He was doing the same to someone else.  And I am deeply disturbed by what I have learned.  See, it's a politician.  He has to say this.  Yeah.  You gotta think, if your father's 81 and he's banging a 38-year-old, you gotta be pretty 
[00:57:00]  psyched for your dad.  Politician speech.  You gotta be pretty psyched for your own future, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, if it's genetic, you know.  And then the-  And they're banging it in your 80s.  This is why I hate politicians in general, because they have to say the right thing.  Uh, he clearly has some issues that need to be dealt with, and I will encourage him to  seek the necessary help.  If this was, um, you know, someone in their late teens, early 20s, caught in a car, first 
[00:57:30]  of all, it wouldn't be in the news.  Um, but no one thinks twice about that.  It's just, hey, you know, those kids, they just love the sex and having fun.  Just because this guy is having a little fun in the same nature, in the same vein, why  is it a problem?  Why does he have issues if he wants to have a little sex in a car?  It's a thrill, it's fun, he's having sex.  He was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Two at a time.  Maybe one is just a fact that he can do it. 
[00:58:00]  Because you'd be applauding the man.  Hey, you got the pills out there now.  Yeah.  The pills take care of all that.  Oh, the women must love the fact that Viagra, Cialis-  I talked about this.  The old women are like, oh, geez, thanks.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Thank you, drug companies.  You sons of bitches.  Because I don't care what you say, man.  Women, you know, they just lose the urge when they get up there.  They lose the urge.  They lose the ability, really.  Yeah.  We've always used the old house analogy. 
[00:58:30]  If there's a house in the neighborhood that the lawn is well-groomed, it's a new house.  They keep it nice.  The windows are all clean.  If you're looking for a house, everyone's looking for new construction.  Yeah, new construction.  That way, you know, nothing's rickety inside.  And it's comfortable.  You open the door.  You walk in.  It smells nice and new, the house and everything.  People can live there, be there, and enjoy themselves. 
[00:59:00]  The lawn is perfect.  Well manicured.  Perfect.  There's no, like...  Landscaped perfectly.  All the bushes are trimmed very nicely.  Yeah.  Oh, I think I'm getting it now.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We'd have kept going.  There's no weeds.  No.  Sticking out of the sidewalk.  Coming out from the driveway.  Right.  No weeds to be seen.  And when you're in the house, Anthony, there's no leaks.  There's no stains on the ceiling.  No, St. doesn't have that musty smell.  Just a... 
[00:59:30]  No leaks.  Fresh.  No leaks.  The plumbing is fine.  The plumbing is...  The plumbing is perfect.  Nothing wrong with the septic tank, matter of fact.  The plumber didn't have to come in and say, I'm sorry, we got to remove your water heater.  Right.  You know?  It's perfect.  You don't have the septic tank kind of bubbling up in the backyard.  No.  It's a nice, brand new, young house.  No stretch marks in the house.  Of course.  Thank you, Rich.  Thanks, Rich.  What the hell does that mean, you ass?  But now with this Viagra and Cialis and everything else the guys are using, we kind of use the 
[01:00:00]  analogy of an older house.  Right.  Now, the guy wants to hold a party in the house.  Now, a newer house, it's fine, like we just described.  Right.  But the older house, you can barely open the front door.  It's all creaky because no one's been in there in so long.  The front door just needs a lot of oil to get...  A lot of grease on the hinges.  Right.  Because no one's even been through that door.  That's right.  For many, many years.  Many years.  One of those houses that you see it in your neighborhood, that one stupid house that has 
[01:00:30]  just been sitting there and no one has been really living in it.  Oh, the bushes are all overgrown.  The haunted house?  Yeah, the haunted house that everyone's afraid of.  The grass is...  Oh, my God.  No one wants to go in there.  Who would let their grass grow a foot to two feet high?  No one.  Because they know.  With the weeds.  They know no one's coming to visit.  And if you're able to get that front door open after greasing it up nice...  Yeah.  Ah, the leaks inside and the smells because no one's been in there.  It's just a problem house.  It's what they call a money pit. 
[01:01:00]  Right.  It's just a mess.  But a lot of these older houses are a lot bigger than the newer ones.  Oh, but you still don't want to go in it.  You don't want to go in.  You want to hold a party in there.  You want to have fun.  You want it to be nice.  And forget about using the back door.  Because if you think the front door needed some lubrication on the hinges...  Yeah.  ...to even creak that thing open so you could even take a peek inside...  Yeah.  ...the back door's just been boarded up.  You don't even want a piece of that.  The septic tank in the back. 
[01:01:30]  Piece of that.  Oof.  The grass is growing nice because of the leakage from the septic tank.  Yeah.  Yeah, the landscaping hasn't been taken care of in years.  So there's brush and bushes popping up where it never should be.  Just a wreck.  Shingles are falling off of the house.  Yeah.  And since the original house, there's new additions on the...  Oh, they all leak.  And that's, you know...  Needs a paint job.  That's what it is.  That's the analogy we like to use. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, but these poor old broads with the Viagra.  And then they try to...  Like, there's this product out there.  I don't know the name, but it tries to sound like amour.  Like love.  And it's supposed to get them in the mood.  Right.  Like, you give a guy a Viagra.  Forget it.  He's going out and he's going to try to get something because he's got no choice.  You give a woman one of these things, an old broad, she's just going to be like,  What?  What do you want from me?  What do you want from me?  I'm cooking.  I just want to do my knitting. 
[01:02:30]  I just want to die.  I'm knitting an afghan for my grandchild.  I can't be bothered, Henry.  Put that away.  I'm knitting.  Anyway, back to this 81-year-old and his 38-year-old girlfriend.  Oh, yeah, we were talking about that.  And the senator, once again, I love my father deeply.  I do not condone his actions or behavior, and I'm deeply disturbed by what I've learned.  He clearly has some issues.  Yeah. 
[01:03:00]  He has no issues.  Oh, there's another interesting twist to this.  He clearly has some issues that need to be dealt with, and I will encourage him to seek the necessary help.  The necessary help.  What's the necessary help?  And why would you start therapy at 81?  Yes, someone's going to sit him down and say it's really wrong that you, an 81-year-old, is banging a 38-year-old?  I think it's because of the next line.  Coleman Sr.'s wife.  See, this could be a problem. 
[01:03:30]  By the way, she's the old house on the block.  I had no idea he didn't sell the old house.  Yeah, he didn't sell the old house before he bought the new one.  He's got two houses.  I had no idea.  He's renting the new one, but he still owns the old house.  Right.  Oh, boy.  Coleman Sr.'s wife.  Oh, dear Lord.  Beverly Coleman, who is also the senator's mother, told the St. Paul Pioneer Press that she was shocked by the arrest. 
[01:04:00]  I can't believe this is true, said Beverly.  She told the newspaper her husband has...  Oh, no.  Here you go.  Her husband has emphysema and suffers from symptoms that could be the beginning of Alzheimer's disease.  I forgot which one was my wife.  Yeah, I don't know.  Freaking brilliant.  I had what with who and where?  Brilliant.  I have Alzheimer's.  Leave me alone.  This guy's brain is still functioning.  Of course it is. 
[01:04:30]  Perfectly.  And you know what the emphysema thing is?  If he's having sex with a 38-year-old woman in a car, he doesn't have emphysema.  Doesn't.  The emphysema thing is when Beverly gets a little amorous.  And, you know, he's been to the new house.  He don't want to deal with the creaky hinges and nothing else.  So he starts going, you know I have emphysema.  Clara, or whatever your name is, Alzheimer's kicking in. 
[01:05:00]  I got to step out for a little while.  He's banging this 38-year-old wherever he can.  And then when he gets caught, he just claims Alzheimer's and emphysema.  What?  I did what?  This guy is brilliant.  He really is.  Salute.  I say there's nothing wrong with this guy.  Except that maybe he should divorce his wife.  Yeah.  Because this 38-year-old is his girlfriend.  Sell the old place.  Someone will knock it down and build on something new.  Can a house get old after eight months? 
[01:05:30]  Oh, jeez.  Wow.  Richard.  How dare you?  Rich.  You're the old house.  You realize that.  Yeah.  Who are you kidding?  You've got to know your place.  You know, it's funny.  Whenever these politicians sometimes, the wife always has to give a statement.  Yeah.  You have to get prepared.  Like, you know, the governor in Jersey.  Oh, that whole thing.  How do you get prepared?  Where the governor came out. 
[01:06:00]  The wife giving the statement.  Let me get my teeth.  Yeah.  Harley from New York City.  You want the model home, not a fixer-upper.  Right.  That's basically what we're getting at.  The model home.  All right.  Nothing better than that brand new carpet and paint smell.  Right?  The new house.  Let's go to Eric in New Jersey.  Love it.  Eric?  Hi, Charlie.  Smells like bubble gum and homework.  Eric.  Charlie. 
[01:06:30]  What?  Charlie in New Jersey.  All right, Charlie.  Let's go.  I have a similar story.  So, if I was 47, wife 18, I closed my establishment.  That closes at three.  It's a bar.  I went to go eat over.  A bar of course.  It opens up at four.  They busted me.  Gave me 90 days.  They said my wife was doing something for me in a car.  I realized I wasn't 80, but I was as old as her parents.  And I got 90 days for that.  You got 90 days for having sex in a car?  Well, I wasn't even doing it, actually. 
[01:07:00]  I was waking her up.  There's no way you got 90 days for that.  What else was going on?  Yeah.  Well, they asked for my identification, and I handed them something with it.  It was very stupid, and that's what the 90 days came about.  Oh, you handed them a little, hey, maybe we could take care of this right here in Brainerd.  It was in my pocket for a very long time.  Wait, so what happened?  I think he was trying to hand the cop a couple of bucks with his license or something.  You probably insulted the cops.  If you're going to do that, you got to give him a smash. 
[01:07:30]  By the way, one of the best scenes in Fargo is when Buscemi gets pulled over and starts that whole thing.  Let me get rid of this guy.  Thanks, Charlie.  He's like, you know, maybe we could take care of this right here in Brainerd.  Right.  Right here.  I was thinking, you know, instead of running through the whole thing with the court, we could take care of it.  You know, right here in Brainerd.  Step out of the vehicle, please.  What an ass.  All right.  Let's say hi to Sharon in Connecticut.  Sharon.  Hi, guys.  How are you doing?  I wanted to let you know Entertainment Weekly is reporting that the Logo Channel is planning a sitcom about a family who was haunted by a homosexual phantom. 
[01:08:00]  And yes, he lives in the closet.  A gay ghost?  Of course he does.  A gay ghost.  And the headline actually says, Logoing Too Far?  You know what?  Oh.  I think I got to start watching this logo.  It's so stupid.  It's like a gay ghost in Mrs. Muir.  I know.  Like that old show, The Ghost in Mrs. Muir.  There's a gay ghost in the closet that haunts the sitcom family. 
[01:08:30]  In the house.  Exactly.  And the first thing that came to my mind was a little Brady Bunch, you know, ghost music.  And maybe Robert Reed is the one living in there.  Oh, that one.  Where the ghost episode.  Oh.  There's like mysterious robes being left around your house and cups of broth.  Yeah, it's not cold.  You wake up and there's new window treatments on your windows.  How did that happen? 
[01:09:00]  What is it?  There's a ghost.  A gay ghost in the house.  Okay.  I'll have to make sure I tune into that one.  All of a sudden the vacuum's going and you're not sure why?  Things are being cleaned up fabulously.  Your hair gel's replaced by a better brand.  There's just the perfect wine for your dinner in the fridge.  This ghost is a pain in the ass.  Quite literally.  Very nice.  Thank you, Sharon.  Thanks. 
[01:09:30]  Well, we do have more logo stuff we could get into.  We could talk about Ant.  I like how you put it.  Ant?  Ant has a show on logo.  Logos.  Not our Ant.  No, not me.  Ant from Last Comic Standing.  Fielding offers.  What's it called?  What's it called?  Fraud?  What?  You're another Ant fan, are you?  Ugh.  I guess he travels America kind of like David Tell.  Yeah.  But instead of finding like a bar and drinking with the locals.  Rest stops around the country.  Ant's trying to find the gay in every city. 
[01:10:00]  A two-inch hole saw and bathroom stalls and Ant.  Wait.  Sam's back.  Hi, Sam.  Hold on.  Sam's back in studio here.  Mm-hmm.  Ah.  Sam's not black.  His ancestor's Thomas Jefferson.  He's not black. 
[01:10:30]  He doesn't have big lips, just a real big thong.  Well, his skin's kind of weird.  It's not black or white.  If he's white, then he's dark.  If he's black, he's light.  Who the hell can figure?  Who the hell can figure?  If Sam's white or an...  White or an...  Are you there with teasing, you know?  Cause he's white with an afro.  Sam's not black. 
[01:11:00]  He's not black.  Don't smoke crack.  He ain't black.  There you go.  Hi, Sam.  Hi, Sam.  Really fast, cause we gotta take a break.  What were we gonna get into there?  Yeah, we could've done longer, but we had to play your song.  I know.  No, the Ant show.  Yeah, yeah.  He's basically just going around.  He goes to cities, to cities that you wouldn't expect to find gay people or gay things.  Oh, that's good.  There's a little town in Wyoming he should visit.  I think Birmingham, Alabama...  Yes. 
[01:11:30]  ...is the episode that you have in front of you.  I hope he gets beat up.  Oof.  Well, Birmingham, you don't...  Wow.  You don't find gay Jews or anybody in Birmingham.  Hang on.  All right.  Well, we'll...  That's true.  We got some of that audio maybe we could get on later today.  Hopefully.  We'll see.  We got a busy show.  We got Disturbed coming in today.  Mick Foley, phone her in a few minutes?  Ooh.  Our old pal Mick Foley?  You rock?  How you feeling about that, huh?  And Disturbed's doing the walkover with us as well today. 
[01:12:00]  The Disturbed.  The Disturbed, yes.  All right.  I just thought you meant our audience, cause that happens every day.  The Disturbed.  I think we got OzFest tickets to give away for the walkover today.  Very good.  Not a lot, so I think we got about 15 pairs or so.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  We'll continue in just a bit with Rich Voss and Bonnie McFarlane.  Sorry, Bonnie McFarlane.  Bonnie McFarlane.  How'd you like to contribute to the Opie and Anthony show?  Well, it's as easy as XYZ.  Before you even start, make sure, first and foremost, that you have something to contribute to the show. 
[01:12:30]  I have a relevant and topical observation that's sure to impress.  And work to the program's benefit.  Great.  Now use your fat, dirty fingers and dial 866-313-FREE.  1-866-313-3733.  Now use that fat, ugly mouth of yours to pronounce and articulate every single word clearly.  Give your name and location followed by a brief and relevant description of what you want to talk about. 
[01:13:00]  You know, just like a normal human being.  This is John from Philadelphia.  And I have a comment on a relevant topic.  Congratulations.  That wasn't so hard, was it?  Remember, it only takes one insipid caller to derail an entire talk show.  So take others into consideration before irresponsibly calling with nothing to add.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:13:30]  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Oh, just a reminder, a week from today, we broadcast live from Boston.  Yes.  We'll be in WBCN's studio up there in Boston.  We're very excited.  We're looking for the listeners and the O.N.A. pests and everyone else to show up at WBCN. 
[01:14:00]  And we're going to do like a walkover like we do every day after the first half of the O.P. and Anthony Show.  You know, we walk over to XM every day.  And we're going to do that up in Boston and then fool around with the fans outside the studio.  And we might have tickets to the O.N.A. traveling virus.  That's a week from Saturday at the DCU Center in Worcester, Massachusetts.  Tickets still available through Ticketmaster.  And you can get all the details by going to O.P. and Anthony.com.  Could it be a madhouse?  But I do believe we'll have a bunch of tickets to give away next week. 
[01:14:30]  All right.  Right.  Where do we go next?  You know, we should talk about Jody Applegate.  Jody Applegate?  She, uh...  The assault on the media thing.  With the news here.  Is alive and well.  We're not doing it, uh, currently.  You never know.  You never know, though.  We had some fun, man.  We were doing these assaults on the media.  It was our listeners, our pests, were doing it.  You've seen the live shots around your city. 
[01:15:00]  It's just a reporter out on the street.  And they talk to people on the street, or they're in front of this crime scene.  I never knew why they had to be where something happened.  Like, it was just last night that a horrible accident right here where I'm standing.  Who cares?  Like, you could do the same thing.  How much time has to go by before the location becomes irrelevant?  Yeah.  Once a dinosaur was right here, where I'm standing.  Uh, you're a little late.  It was a while ago. 
[01:15:30]  You're late.  You missed it.  Put the camera away.  It would be impressive if you were sitting there waiting for the crime to happen.  Yeah, but, uh, no.  No.  Never happens that way.  So, uh, Jody Applegate was doing something on the street.  I guess a demonstration on stealing bicycles in the city.  Big problem.  Oh, what's the matter?  What happened?  Last night, we saw this, uh, just a piece of a bicycle chained to a, uh, a post.  It was just this, it was just the, like, they'd stolen everything.  They stole from the pedals. 
[01:16:00]  It was just a frame.  It was just, like, the smallest part of the frame that still had the lock.  So, even if you lock it up, yeah, you just don't take it for parts.  It was still locked, but the rest of the bike was completely gone.  Only in New York.  The bike was raped completely.  Yeah, I wouldn't.  All right, Rich, it doesn't matter.  It's radio.  Uh, Rich is all excited.  He's got a picture.  Oh, good for radio.  I think Bonnie already painted the picture.  We were all on the same page.  It was really amazing, guys.  Put it on the website.  It was crazy. 
[01:16:30]  We're staring at it.  It was insane.  You gotta see this.  It's all right, Rich.  It's all right.  All excited.  You gotta show us.  Rich pulled out his phone.  He took a picture.  You guys.  Thank God.  Two pixels.  All right, so.  Phone cameras.  So, continuing.  Jody Applegate here in New York.  Yeah, she was doing the story on the stealing bicycles and how easy it is.  And these two guys were gonna show how easy it is with a little hand grinder and to get 
[01:17:00]  through a chain.  So, they started doing it and they played a little prank on her and made it seem like  one of the guys had gotten a little too close to the grinder with his throat and slit his  throat.  And Jody lost her mind.  This was on live TV yesterday, right?  It was completely live.  And I guess you could go to YouTube to check out the video.  Oh, really?  YouTube is great.  Yeah, they get every bit of video up.  One of the greatest websites out there right now.  So, we're just checking the audio. 
[01:17:30]  It's thumbs up?  All right.  Oh.  They just had to check it really fast.  We got the story here.  So, yeah.  Casey and Van appear on Good Day New York to demonstrate how easy it is to steal a bicycle.  They pull a gag and Jody Applegate doesn't think it's funny.  Not funny.  Oh, boy.  Oh, did someone give you a blank CD as a gag?  That's not funny.  It gave us the thumbs up and everything and now it's not playing.  Oh, it's playing, but all we're hearing is nothingness. 
[01:18:00]  Maybe I better get the picture off the phone now.  Quick, Rich.  Get that picture.  Huh?  It just worked for me in the other room.  Of course it did, Danny.  Well, it's not working here.  All right.  Well, see, now these guys that were cutting the bike thing were ONA pests?  No, no, no, no, no.  Unfortunately not.  I know.  When we see something like this happen, we're like, oh, man, I hope it was one of ours.  One of ours.  But, no, you've just got to give these guys credit.  Right.  They went above and beyond.  What our fans would do, it started out as just getting in the picture behind a camera's live shot. 
[01:18:30]  We would monitor it in the studio.  They would get behind the reporter, and when they start the report, they'd jump around like an idiot.  Then we had them holding up signs that said Opie and Anthony.  And then it got to the point where we were like, well, you know, you'd get a little more attention maybe if you had a bear costume on.  You'll really look stupid.  And then we brought up the idea of maybe as they're doing their live stand-up report in the middle of it, just start a conversation with the reporter about nothing in particular. 
[01:19:00]  Hey, how you doing?  This is always our problem.  We come up with fantastic ideas, and then we always take it too far.  It's got to go too far because we've got to one-up ourselves, and it's been our downfall every time.  Ever since we started doing radio together.  Because there was no problem with just the assault with the signs.  Right.  Because it's completely legal.  Yeah.  So you're getting the name out there, and it's not interrupting with anything.  So that's where the problem came about. 
[01:19:30]  But engaging them in conversation, which was really funny.  Really funny.  Excuse me.  Excuse me, sir.  Yes, sir.  Excuse me.  Can I ask you a question?  And this is on live TV.  And the guy's looking like, I'm doing a report here, idiot.  There's no take two for these guys, and they're tapping, excuse me, excuse me.  That's hilarious.  And then we'd get the follow-up, too, from the guy.  Right.  It's like, you know, after the guy goes, and let's look at that film clip now.  And they'd switch.  You'd hear from our guy going, oh, man, this guy's pissed.  Oh, they're chasing me down the street.  So the whole thing was hysterical. 
[01:20:00]  And we started using air horns.  And then somebody had to use one of those air horns.  They use it at football games.  And allegedly, a guy too close to his ear, the reporter.  I got to say, the greatest one, one of the right up there was No Filter Pauls, the girl in Times Square.  Oh, yeah.  She was a short little thing, so she had to do her report on, like, a box to make her look taller.  Oh, he was standing on a box.  And these guys come in, and they were so obnoxious, she just gave up. 
[01:20:30]  On live TV, she just gave up and walked out of the shot.  And then there you have No Filter Paul and the other dude, I forgot his name,  just jumping up and down on live TV.  We've seen reporters run the gamut of professionalism and just completely losing it.  The pros stand there, and we're amazed going, this guy is super reporter.  Super reporter.  You can't fluster him.  There's pandemonium breaking around him.  And he just continues and gets through it until they go to the film club. 
[01:21:00]  Those are the ones that started off at storms by the ocean.  Right, right.  Nothing distracts him.  And then we've seen the woman who just left her shot.  She just, like, walked away from her live shot.  Left.  Does anybody just laugh?  Does anybody...  A couple of chuckles early on.  One guy got fired.  One guy got fired, and he's the guy that lost it.  He was going to his film piece, and he goes, let's take a look at that now.  And the word now to go to the film piece barely got out of his mouth, and he turned around and said, hey, man, what the F is your problem? 
[01:21:30]  And let the F-bomb fly on TV.  That was it.  And they fired him.  Yeah.  So he lost it, lost his job.  We've seen people in various degrees of losing it.  It was hysterical.  It was a great bit, great way to get exposure for the show until they told us to stop because, yeah.  Now, when the little lady ran away, did someone come and pick up her box?  Like, was there someone...  No, they just go right to the film piece. 
[01:22:00]  Are we going to try it again?  Yeah.  Right to the film piece.  I gather somebody comes and picks up her little box and puts it in the truck.  So now are they going to have security people with them?  Well, they did for a while.  They were doing the live shots.  When we did this the first time, they were starting to do the live shots from the roofs of the vans.  And somebody actually got to one of those girls, too, and held up a sign with the mother of all curse words that starts with a C right in the picture behind her. 
[01:22:30]  Here's a...  Oh, is this that right?  Is this bleep for this side of the Opie and Anthony show?  So juvenile and so funny.  Here's the Arthur Chien one that got fired.  We have to bleep it on this side of the show.  So, XM, you know, please bear with us.  Calm down and shut up.  Good morning, Sean.  This is apparently a very simple crime to commit.  All one has to do is buy multiple MetroCard, stand at the turnstile, and just continuously swipe people in all day.  Police sources say these guys net a couple hundred dollars a day, and that's pure profit.  But it's costing the TA a great deal, about 16 million dollars a year, and they're trying to put a stop to it. 
[01:23:00]  What the f*** is your problem, man?  Right out over the air.  Didn't miss a beat.  At least wait.  He was so pissed he just lost it.  He was so close to getting out of it.  Yeah, yeah, it was ready to go to the film piece.  Yeah.  And it was casual in the background.  It wasn't even one of the more obnoxious assaults on the media.  Hasn't he ever seen when the reporter has to stand there like an idiot because their film isn't ready?  We take you there now. 
[01:23:30]  And they're just standing there looking into the camera, and then they kind of look to the side a little like,  Hey, is someone going to help me here?  I look like an idiot.  Yeah, why couldn't you just improv your way out of that situation?  Yeah.  They all look like just dummies.  All right, we finally got the Jodi Applegate.  What we just did for everybody to tear down one of the walls is...  Which wall?  You've got to give it a number.  The sixth wall.  Sixth wall.  The place is weird.  The audio was all screwed up, so what Ant and I just did there was we did some filler.  We just kind of...  It's called filler. 
[01:24:00]  It was a riffing.  Yeah, we riffed.  We just talked out of our you-know-whats, just trying to...  Mouth, Zopi.  I totally fell for it.  Yeah, we were just doing...  You were part of it.  I thought we were actually doing something.  You fell into it.  It's very rare, but at times we've got to show people how great we are at radio.  We just sat there for ten minutes just babbling about nothing until the tape piece was ready for us.  We, like, verbally raped you.  You didn't even know it happened until you were in it.  Ant and I actually had that unspoken communication, like, this old gag. 
[01:24:30]  We just got to babble for a few minutes until the tape's ready.  Backpedal.  You guys had the best setups.  Like, oh, yeah.  Like, we really wanted to talk about the assault on the media thing again.  Again.  Old news.  Who cares?  Right.  I was completely riveted.  Now that what we need is here, who cares about the last five minutes of what we just babbled about?  This is what we really want to play today.  So it's Jodie Applegate here in New York.  Better work.  She got very angry on...  Very angry. 
[01:25:00]  ...on live TV.  Once again, these two dudes were demonstrating how easy it is to steal a bicycle.  They pull a prank, make him believe that the device that you use to cut the chain cut the guy's neck.  And he was bleeding like crazy from his neck.  He started screaming.  And Jodie Applegate didn't think it was funny whatsoever.  I don't know.  Joel is reviewing a summer movie.  This is...  I saw this last night.  On GMA.  I was just wondering if it was going to be a...  No, I saw this last night.  That's the mom from Sixth Sense that was in studio.  This is Little Miss Sunshine.  Right.  It's a good movie. 
[01:25:30]  Did you like it, Opie?  I didn't mind it at all.  Aww.  I didn't mind it.  I don't know what the movie was really about.  I guess it was the dynamics of a family that's all effed up.  He's smiling.  Trying to get to California so their little chubby girl could be in one of these beauty  pageants.  And then she's in the beauty pageant with all these, you know, quote, hot-looking eight-year-olds.  Little JonBenet type.  Yeah, creepy.  Like creepy, all made up like they're adults.  And the little chubby ones trying to compete against them.  That's the creepy part, the chubby one?  Trying to compete?  I don't want to, I mean, it was really funny. 
[01:26:00]  I mean, I haven't heard a theater openly laugh as loud as they did last night near the end  of this movie.  That's all I have to say, yeah.  It was all right.  The views are in.  It's kind of like an artsy film, though.  Greg Opie Hughes says.  It's like almost an indie film.  It's in regular theaters.  It's like, you know what I mean?  Because you leave the theater like, wow, they didn't really accomplish much with this  movie.  It's good.  But the characters were great.  Alan Arkin's in it as the grandfather who, like, snorts heroin. 
[01:26:30]  Really?  Yeah.  And Steve Carell's in it.  I would have walked out.  Yeah.  The movie starts with Steve Carell.  I'm outraged.  Steve Carell is in a, this is fresh.  I just saw last night.  Steve Carell is in a hospital because he tried to kill himself like Bonnie.  I was just a cry for help.  I wasn't really.  Yeah.  Steve Carell, you know, he slit his wrist.  That's how the movie starts.  I'm not giving much away.  And he's part of this family dynamics with the grandfather that snorts the heroin and 
[01:27:00]  the little chubby girl that thinks she could be like Miss America someday.  A dysfunctional family bringing themselves together for a common purpose.  And then the son who decided, you know, he's reading Nietzsche and he decided he doesn't  want to talk for a year and he's up to like nine months of not talking to his own family.  I mean, the characters are, it's a good movie.  It's all right.  And it's getting pretty good reviews.  Is that Greg Gineer in the movie?  Huh?  Greg Gineer is like.  Greg Gineer.  Did you just say Greg Gineer?  He's, you know, he's a motivational mother of pearls. 
[01:27:30]  He's a motivational speaker.  He's got two pieces of Nicorette in his mouth.  Yeah.  He's, he's just trying not to smoke.  All right.  Here we go.  Finally, Jody Apple.  Never seen something on the Nicorette thing that says may affect your ability to speak.  If you thought he's, uh, uh, uh, I can't do it.  Where's your Nicorette?  I was going to say if you thought he drooled before.  All right.  Here we go.  Let's get this Jody Applegate thing done.  All right.  Show us how unfortunately easy it is to do what you're going to do. 
[01:28:00]  Tell us what that is.  All right.  So I have an angle grinder.  It's designed to cut metal.  And, uh, you plug this into the bottom of a light post.  Get on that.  Yeah.  Turn.  Turn it on.  Yeah.  What Van's doing now is he's just cutting right through the, uh, Van's cutting right through  the, um, the chain here.  And if you look closely, you can see how it goes right through.  And, uh, you have to be very careful of these. 
[01:28:30]  Oh.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Cut it out.  Cut it out.  Stop that.  No, I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  I'm fine.  I'm just kidding.  No, no, it's okay.  It was just, I was just kidding.  No, no, no, no, we were just kidding.  No, no, no, no.  We were trying to do a serious thing here and this is not funny.  Do not get ketchup.  Do not be upset.  There are children watching.  It was not funny.  Oh, my.  Oh, we were just doing a ruse.  And this is not planned.  No, we were just.  Not planned by me.  We were just doing a ruse. 
[01:29:00]  I don't appreciate that on our show and our air.  Do not be upset.  Oh, fuck.  You did not agree to that.  We'll be right back after this.  That was not cool, dude.  That was not cool, dude.  Wait, wait.  Can I ask what channel that was?  That's Fox.  Fox.  Local Fox in New York.  You bastards.  You bad.  There are children watching.  I've seen more death and destruction on Fox.  Real death.  Not a guy with ketchup packets.  How many times did they show that dead woman in the wheelchair in Louisiana? 
[01:29:30]  In New Orleans when they had the hurricane.  They showed that dead person 800 times on Fox.  They show blown up people in the Middle East on the news.  Saddam's kids.  There's children watching.  The best part.  He should have said, hey, I didn't.  It's not like I cut my uncle off.  The best part of that is the whole, that's not cool.  Yeah.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  Because she's hip.  You know, off hours, I could swing with you guys. 
[01:30:00]  But not on my show.  Damn it.  There are kids watching, dude.  Dude.  I'll throw back some shots with you after the show, but not during the show.  But didn't that make you hate her?  Oh, my God.  Just a.  The most unlikable person.  Crumudgeon.  Yeah.  What a curmudgeonly broad.  Not cool, dude.  The video's up on YouTube.  We'll have it up on our website later today.  By the way, by not cool, totally cool.  Yeah.  Because it's a ruse. 
[01:30:30]  It's a ruse.  The guy's like, I was kidding.  What?  What?  I was only kidding.  I was only kidding.  The kids would love it.  They'd go, hey, look, our bike didn't get stolen.  He cut his throat.  Yeah.  He slit his throat.  Good for him, the thief.  We got to get those guys on the show.  See, the bad guy gets his in the end.  That's what he was showing.  I have to hear it one more time.  I got to hear her.  I was laughing too much.  Yeah, let's try not to laugh too much.  I was laughing too much.  I think we missed a few things because we were laughing.  Her anger is great.  Here it is again.  It's some kind of device that cuts through these massive bike chains so you can steal 
[01:31:00]  the bikes, and these guys are demonstrating for Jody Applegate.  Ugh.  All right.  Show us how unfortunately easy it is to do what you're going to do.  Tell us what that is.  All right.  So I have an angle grinder.  It's designed to cut metal, and you plug this into the bottom of a light post.  Get on that.  Yeah.  Turn.  Turn it on.  Yeah.  What Dan's doing now is he's just cutting right through.  He sounds like Spicoli from Fast Time. 
[01:31:30]  What I'm doing.  He's cutting right through.  All right, Hamilton.  He's like.  Because he knows what he's about to.  Whoa.  I could fix it.  What I'm doing.  Yeah, what Dan's doing now is he's just cutting right through the, uh, Dan's cutting  right through the, um, the chain here.  And if you look closely, you can see how it goes right through.  And, uh, you have to be very careful of these. 
[01:32:00]  Oh.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Cut it out.  Cut it out.  Stop that.  No, I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  I'm fine.  You stop.  I was just kidding.  No, no, no.  It's okay.  It was just.  I was just kidding.  No, no, no, no, no.  We were trying to do a serious thing here.  And this is not funny.  Do not.  That's catch up.  Do not be upset.  There are children watching.  That was not funny.  That's totally uncool.  Oh, we were just doing a ruse.  And this is not fair.  Not by me.  We were just doing a ruse.  And I don't appreciate that on our show, in our air. 
[01:32:30]  Do not be upset.  That was a ruse.  And we did not agree to that.  We'll be right back after this.  That was not cool.  That was not cool, dude.  The best line now.  My favorite new line is, we were just doing a ruse.  We were just doing a ruse.  We're just kidding.  We're just doing a ruse.  Tomato ketchup.  Just a ruse.  This guy sounds so hot.  Oh, no.  Right.  It's like we're doing a serious piece here.  It's about bikes getting stolen. 
[01:33:00]  Wait, wait.  Jody, Jody.  Listen, listen up.  What was that?  That was my skull.  I'm so wasted.  It's a ruse.  It's a ruse.  And the thing with Hollywood, these guys are going to get a development deal for Fox now.  Yeah.  Hey, Rad, where'd you get that grinder?  It's just tomato ketchup.  He's like trying to call.  How many times do you say we're kidding to her?  No matter where you are, make it like that's the place to slit your throat. 
[01:33:30]  Hey, Debbie.  But these guys thought that she was going to kind of laugh.  Yeah.  You know, they thought, hey, this is funny.  And then finish the story.  I don't know.  I think they were too high to really think it through.  They just wanted to have some fun.  And what did they do after the ruse?  Me and Mick are going to wing on over London and jam with the stones.  Yeah.  Jody Applegate did do Steve's.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, yeah, she did.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Relax. 
[01:34:00]  All right?  My old man is a television repairman.  He's got this ultimate set of tools.  I can fix it.  That's an angle grinder.  That's an angle grinder.  By the way, let's point out that Fox is showing other kids how they can steal bikes.  Because I guess this little tool they were using can be bought at any hardware.  You can get it anywhere.  And where'd you get that grinder?  Out of the hamper?  I guess the video is up on YouTube.  It's going to get hit like crazy.  Oh, yeah.  And Steve will have it up on opianthony.com. 
[01:34:30]  He should have had it up already.  He would have got a million hits today.  We're doing a serious news piece here.  Oh, Jody.  How you doing?  Jody will have the linguine and white clam sauce.  And a Coke.  No ice.  I love the moan.  Oh, absolutely.  Absolutely.  That's hilarious.  See, everyone's saying the video's not up on YouTube.  No.  You had a mic in front of you when you said it. 
[01:35:00]  It had to be true.  That's what I was told.  Well, we'll find out where the video is and we'll give you a heads up after the break or something.  That is some classic audio, man.  Isn't that great?  She's pissed, dude.  Shut up, Jody.  Shut up, Jody.  That's the lady that gets up and walks out of the show.  Yeah.  And she tries to get her whole table to go with her.  Yeah.  You know, it was a good time right up until you did this.  Yes.  Wow, really?  Everyone has their favorite part, Lead Belly.  The best part is that she made it about the children right off the bat. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  There are children watching.  Why don't you watch your own channel and see what you do for the children?  They're sick kids.  Make a wish.  Their last wish was to see this broadcast.  Hey, Robert Reed, T-Cell, he writes, hey, reporter lady, what's your problem, bub?  Hey, bud.  I don't know.  What are we doing?  We're stealing some bikes, slitting some throats, learning about Cuba, eating some food. 
[01:36:00]  That's so funny.  They had the pot laugh and everything these times.  I know.  Oh, hey, we're kidding.  It's tomato ketchup.  It's a ruse.  Hey, you're stopping the broadcast.  You.  Wouldn't she know something was up when they were opening the bottle of Heinz in front of her?  Perhaps this is part of the stealing the bicycle to lubricate the saw blade.  They're using ketchup.  To distract the owner of the bike, we tend to cut our throat. 
[01:36:30]  Isn't that great?  It's so funny.  Very funny.  Bravo to those guys.  Yeah, they're great.  I want to talk to them.  Where are they?  We've got to get them on the air.  Yeah, we'll try to find them.  They're heroes today.  Yeah.  There you go.  They got their YouTube video.  It's all about the YouTube video these days.  It's right up our alley, stuff like that, man.  Absolutely.  Bravo.  Try to get your video on YouTube.  Oh, here it is.  How do you get the search done? 
[01:37:00]  I don't know if that's it or not.  Oh, you don't know?  No.  There's like a million of them.  Oh, there's a million of them?  All right.  We're going to try to find the video for you.  We'll give you a heads up after the break.  That'll be front and center.  You check FARC?  FARC.com usually has.  Video is on collegehumor.com.  It's on defamer.com.  Yeah, it's got to be all over the place.  You don't get a newswoman losing her mind like that and not have it make the internet in a second.  These are the same kids that are watching the senator's father have sex in a car.  Yes, and then reporting them to the police.  Yeah, that's the woman. 
[01:37:30]  It's like her.  Yeah, that's the woman.  That's the woman that reported them.  You know, I was passing.  No, stop that, old man.  Stop.  No, the children could be watching.  Want to see that?  Then you ask her off air, do you have kids?  I hate them.  Yeah.  Like she cares about kids.  All right, we got to take a break.  She did sound like a mother, like yelling at children.  Yeah, totally.  It was like she was yelling at, get away from that.  No, no, no.  Get out of your mouth.  Don't touch that.  Stop it.  Not cool, dude.  Quit running with a grinder in your hand.  You're going to hit your brother.  All right, I'm looking at the video on collegehumor.com right now. 
[01:38:00]  It's definitely on collegehumor.  What's the search for that, E-Rock?  Does the anger come through?  Does anyone know?  I'll put it up on Foundry.  All right, we're going to put the video up on foundrymusic.com, one of our websites.  It'll be linked on opiananthony.com in minutes, okay?  Oh, damn it.  I've got to see it now.  But he's a stoner, dude.  Wait.  Whoa.  Hey, come over here.  It's playing over there if you want to restart it.  Yeah, restart it.  I'll watch it over there.  Anthony's got to see this.  What?  No, no, before that.  Before that. 
[01:38:30]  Before that.  Before that.  Oh, boss, that guy's a worse actor than you.  What?  She knew he was faking immediately.  Yeah, he's not even trying to be serious.  So they're cutting through the chain, and then he makes believe it gets his neck.  There he goes.  He goes down, he's flailing on the ground like a fish, he's got long hair, he looks like  a stoner dude.  And then he gets up.  It's a ruse.  It's a ruse.  It's a ruse.  All right, he's still going with the piece.  Yeah.  Trying to cut through the chain.  Oh, that's great.  And then I want to see her lose her mind.  I want to see what she looks like. 
[01:39:00]  Look at her.  She's lecturing them.  Oh, she's pointing her finger at him.  Oh, I think she did a little push.  Oh, she threw her copy down.  She threw a copy.  She gave him a little push.  She's pointing.  She's still pointing.  Oh.  Oh, shut up.  And now she's giving the thumb, like, hit the road.  Oh, you're such a do-gooder, aren't you?  Oh, not cool.  And then she points at him again and goes, not cool, dude.  She just stepped off her box.  Oh.  I need a glass of Chardonnay.  Yes.  Someone has to say, we condone that activity. 
[01:39:30]  That was amazing.  We condone.  God, what's that beautiful?  We condone that activity.  The best part is they invited these two on the show for this stupid segment.  And it bit him in the ass.  It turned around and nailed him.  And she's all angry.  You're doing a stupid thing showing people how to steal bicycles.  Yeah.  You know what's good?  They're not entertainers, so they have nothing to lose.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, they're not.  You know what the worst part of that whole thing is?  What purpose did that segment serve if it went like the way it was supposed to go? 
[01:40:00]  That chain was huge.  And these guys cut right through it.  What are you supposed to do?  Then show how to protect your bike against that?  By what?  Encasing it in like the Batman shell for his car?  There's no other way but a chain to protect your bicycle.  Sensationalism.  And showing people how to steal bikes.  Yeah, we've got to take a break.  You guys want to hear the audio as we go to break one more time?  Please.  I can't get enough of this.  It'll be crystal clear because we'll turn the mics off. 
[01:40:30]  But here's the audio once again.  The video will be up on opianthony.com.  How long?  In a few minutes.  By the time we get back live, the video will be up on opianthony.com.  Hopefully.  And when we get back, Disturbed joins the program.  But here's the audio one more time.  All right.  Show us how unfortunately easy it is to do what you're going to do.  Tell us what that is.  All right.  So I have an angle grinder.  It's designed to cut metal.  And you plug this into the bottom of a light post.  Get on that.  Yeah.  Turn. 
[01:41:00]  Turn it on.  Yeah.  What Van's doing now is he's just cutting right through.  The Van's cutting right through the chain here.  And if you look closely, you can see how it goes right through.  And you have to be very careful of these.  Cut it out.  Cut it out.  Stop that.  No, I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  I'm fine.  You stopped.  I was just kidding. 
[01:41:30]  No.  No.  It's okay.  I was just kidding.  No.  No.  No.  We were just kidding.  No.  No.  No.  We were trying to do a serious thing here.  And this is not funny.  Do not be upset.  Do not be upset.  There are children watching.  That was not funny.  That was totally uncool.  Oh, we were just doing a ruse.  And this is not planned.  No.  It was not planned by me.  We were just doing a ruse.  And I don't appreciate that on our show and our air.  Do not be upset.  That was a ruse.  Oh, this is just a ruse.  And we did not agree to that.  We'll be right back after this.  That was not cool, too. 
[01:42:00]  We're back.  Back in the New York room.  We're back.  Back in the New York room.  Welcome back to the OVN Anthony Show.  Here with everyone else is talking about. 
[01:42:30]  O&A Uncut and live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  The OVN Anthony Show.  OVN Anthony!  I'm trying to chew. 
[01:43:00]  Sorry.  Nice.  This is the OVN Anthony Show.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  We've got a very busy morning.  We just filmed some dumb corporate video during the break to say hi to corporate.  Yeah, it's one of those things we have to do every so often.  Corporate comes in with a camera and they just go.  And they never really have a plan.  It's just say hi. 
[01:43:30]  Say that you're happy to be here.  It's almost like we should be holding a newspaper with the date on it.  Yeah.  With some people with hoods behind us.  Well, that's the angle.  We love being here.  Well, that's the angle I took.  Like, I was a hostage.  Like, you know, making believe that I had to say that I'm happy to be back at CBS.  And then the camera guy's like, can you now do it with feeling?  I'm like, go F yourself.  I know.  Your acting was so good in that.  And the cameraman all of a sudden had a blow hit.  Your performance, because everybody knew that you were just trying to be. 
[01:44:00]  It was like, we confess to crimes against the state.  That's the kind of thing Ope was playing off of.  And I guess he didn't get it.  I had my eyes moving from side to side like I was reading.  You're reading something.  And then the stupid camera guy doesn't even get it.  He's like, can you do it again with feeling?  I'm like, no, that's the bid, you ass.  And since when do cameramen start giving cues on what to do?  You know, what's he the, hey, you know, when I have a question, do they show this to like  a whole board meeting or something?  Like you say, very board, very board meeting.  Who do they show this to?  It's at these, you know, these, it's corporate events and things like get togethers. 
[01:44:30]  Whenever you get a group of people in suits that are in the corporation, they show like  various talent doing things and they go, ha, ha, ha, ha, and they drink their wine.  Someone get up and walk.  No, kids are watching this.  Yeah, you should have slit your throat with a grinder.  Corporate videos stink.  They're never fun to watch.  Although the sexual harassment ones are a scream where they play them out.  Hi, Jill, looking good today.  I'm offended by what you are saying. 
[01:45:00]  We did.  For the last conversation, we had to have a sexual harassment meeting.  So it was two lady lawyers.  They went over the whole thing.  You can't do this, this, and this.  So any questions?  And I go, I raise my hand, I go, don't you think it's weird that ladies are lawyers to  them and their eyes are lit up?  That they're allowed to be?  I mean, it was just like the lesbianism flew out of their eyes.  You are an ass.  Before we continue, could we acknowledge that?  Yes, please.  They've been waiting in the green room for like a half hour because we're really late 
[01:45:30]  today.  I apologize ahead of time.  Also, the Jody Applegate video is now up on opieandanthony.com.  Did you guys hear that in the green room?  I don't even know who Jody Applegate is.  This is your reporter on Channel 5 here in New York.  She hot?  She's all right, but she got in a little hissy fit.  She's like a cougar hot.  If we can continue with the sexual harassment thing, a hissy fit over two guys that played  a little prank on her.  She was doing a story on how people steal bicycles here in New York by cutting the chain 
[01:46:00]  with a grinding wheel, and they were demonstrating it, and the guy made like he cut his throat  with a grinding wheel by accident and had like fake blood.  All on live TV.  All on live TV.  And she freaked out on the guy.  She just lost it on the guy.  Like, there are children watching.  Meanwhile, Fox is showing like death and destruction every day, like pounding it into your head  when children are watching.  But that's fine.  Fake things.  Fake death.  Never good on news or TV.  They're very afraid of that. 
[01:46:30]  Real death.  Carte Blanche.  Show it all you want.  The more, the better.  Yeah, the more, the better.  They can't show dead people enough.  Kids are going to go out and kill themselves with grinders now.  Grinding wheels.  It's a new thing.  It was sniffing glue and paint.  Now they're slitting their throats.  Here's the best.  Shut up, Jody.  Here's the best face piercings I've ever seen in my life.  Those are the coolest things.  Isn't that cool?  Thank you.  Right through the chin.  Only a rock star or a musician could do that.  No one ever goes into an IBM board meeting with a medal hanging from their chin. 
[01:47:00]  Just give it a try.  Yeah.  Rich, that's David.  And Dan and Mike.  Yes.  I've never met you guys.  We've seen David before.  Hey, there he goes.  Hey, what's up, man?  Wow, you got the crappy seat.  You're like, I have to turn around completely around to see you.  And when I turn this way, Opie can't see you.  No, it's just, we got to still figure out the setup here.  This is Rich Voss.  He's almost famous.  He was this close to being famous.  Let me tell you, I've done a lot of TV and I have a pilot coming out now. 
[01:47:30]  Okay?  Yeah.  Oh, a pilot.  Comedy Central.  Wow.  We're looking for a wedding couple that's getting married in a...  A wedding couple that's getting married, you redundant ass.  A couple that's getting married in September, we're looking for somebody.  So if you're getting married in September, email me at rich at richvoss.com.  We're looking for a couple.  Okay.  It could be on the pilot.  Really?  Yeah, for Comedy Central.  They're just thrilled over there on the couch.  I don't know.  They're just thrilled.  If I'm not talking drugs, I'm not going to get their attention.  Actually, we're not a big drug man, to be honest with you.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah, you're just... 
[01:48:00]  Why don't you just keep putting here?  Assume a little more.  You could talk alcohol.  That would pique our interest.  But drugs has never really been our thing.  You could talk Amsterdam.  Yeah.  Well, there you go.  That's different.  He's been to Amsterdam.  You know, I went to the Anne Frank house in Amsterdam, right?  Yeah.  And they commercialize it, because you go up to the fourth floor, which is from the Nazis.  Then you come down on a water slide.  You've got to go through the souvenir shop on your way out. 
[01:48:30]  You grab a little diary.  You get to go again.  But there's guys in SS uniforms hitting your arm with a hammer.  How cool is that?  You are a horrid human being.  He's a horrid...  He's Jewish.  I know.  Jewish with tattoos.  Yeah, but it's a never again tattoo, at least.  That is such a paradox.  I wish I could do that.  Yeah?  I wish I could.  You have no tattoos there?  No, no.  Rich is a proud Jew, but he doesn't know the rules.  I, too, am Jewish.  Yeah.  I can't, because my family has a burial plot in East Jerusalem in an Orthodox Jewish cemetery. 
[01:49:00]  Seven generations of my family are buried.  Oh, man.  If I want to be laid to rest with them, I can't get to that.  Yeah, you can't even poke yourself with a pen accidentally.  But it's defacing your body, you know?  I mean, so nose jobs or facelifts or piercings?  No, piercings actually don't count.  When the Jews actually exited from Egypt, when they actually made the golden calf, that story  that you hear in the Bible, the gold that they took to make the calf actually came, a 
[01:49:30]  lot of it, from piercings that they had.  Really?  Yeah.  So you think that would kind of put the kibosh on the whole piercing thing because of what  it made, you know?  Those things are not considered.  The term in Jewish terminology is referred to as a mum, which is a permanent mark upon  the flesh.  And as you well know, especially, particularly with muscle tissue areas, they close up pretty  quickly if you actually take out the piercing.  So can't I just have my arms cut off and I'm good? 
[01:50:00]  There you go.  If you die by losing your arms.  They tell me that laser removal is actually really effective.  Yeah.  But you know something?  If I didn't have the whole cemetery issue, I'd have sleeves, I'd have triples.  Yeah, you seem like the kind of guy that would probably be tatted up.  Totally.  Yeah.  I would.  Rich didn't care, though.  Never again.  Did the tatter?  No, that's actually cool.  That's actually cool.  My Jews aren't from Jersey.  They're from Jersey.  Jersey Jews.  And, you know. 
[01:50:30]  What do you think?  I'm sure people have been asking you.  Situation over there.  Israel.  I'm losing my damn mind.  Yeah.  I've got family throughout Israel.  I've got my brother and his new wife still live in Jerusalem.  My family in Haifa.  Oh, so you've got family within range?  I've got family in Sfat.  I've got, you know, about 200 relatives in Israel that still live there.  And you're able to keep in contact?  Yeah.  Or it's very hard to get in touch?  No, I have been able to, actually.  And thank God all of them are okay. 
[01:51:00]  However, a friend of mine has passed.  Really?  Yeah.  Jeez, man.  Yeah, it's one of those situations where, what do you think as a Jew and close ties?  I think that the UN doesn't, needs to leave well enough alone.  I think they should let Israel take the gloves off and clean house.  You know what?  Do what they need to do.  Hezbollah has shot in the last year 800 rockets into Israel.  You know, you don't get that report.  800 in the last year.  Well, how many in the last day? 
[01:51:30]  About, like, 500.  Even weeks up to that.  And then the media will go, the UN and the world is in an uproar because Israel is retaliating  to missiles that have been fired on them for the last two weeks.  They're in an uproar now for several reasons.  Unfortunately, there are mistakes that are made during war.  Now the biggest issue seems to be Kofi Annan making a big stink about that UN post being  hit.  And for him to actually make the statement that it appeared to be deliberate is the most 
[01:52:00]  asinine thing I've ever heard in my life.  What would Israel have to gain by hitting the UN outpost?  There's absolutely no upside to it.  You say the UN getting involved and, you know, kind of...  They're going to have a multinational force once again.  You know, the whole point of the matter is that Lebanon didn't do anything for the past  10 years to do anything about Hezbollah because Hezbollah is very popular.  But a lot of people are saying they were just trying to get their own house in order after 
[01:52:30]  so many years of civil war.  It's kind of hard to keep tabs on your entire country while you're trying to...  I don't buy it because Hezbollah is actually part of the infrastructure.  They actually are a part of schooling.  They're actually a part of lots of other organizations that are very well embedded within the culture  of the people of Lebanon.  And it's not a Sunni Shiite thing.  They help on certain levels across the board.  Hezbollah is not only a terrorist organization. 
[01:53:00]  There are other things that they're doing.  And it sounds like I'm speaking for their benefit, but I'm not.  The point of it is that they utilize those things to win over the faith of the people.  And the people end up supporting them.  These are the same people who dance in the streets when 9-11 happens.  I mean, so I don't really care anymore.  I simply want my family protected.  I simply want the terrorist organizations to be uprooted and to be eradicated.  If we could all lump them onto an island and nuke it, I'd say hell yeah. 
[01:53:30]  I think that's why a lot of people aren't coming out and criticizing Israel, especially here in the States.  It's because enough, all right, enough already.  It's nice, it's refreshing to see a country go in and just say, no, we're not taking it anymore.  And start, you know, sweeping up.  You know, none of them, out of all, I mean, out of all the Arab nations, no one will take the Palestinians because it causes conflict against Israel. 
[01:54:00]  Israel's no bigger than Jersey, surrounded by 20, who knows how many Arabs, not one state country will say, okay, we'll take that.  I'd rather be in northern Israel than Jersey, by the way.  The irony of it is that there are Palestinians in those Arab states.  The very term Palestinian is only a term that has existed for the past 40 years or so.  It comes from the term that the British used for the territory, for the state Palestine.  Yeah.  Coming from a biblical word, the Philistines, back in the day. 
[01:54:30]  There are no people, okay, specifically that you can date that have a descendancy within Arab culture beyond 40 years that were called Palestinians.  It does not exist.  There are Palestinians, 70%, 65%, 70% of the Jordanian population are quote-unquote Palestinians.  Yeah.  And how much of the percentage of the population of Israel is Palestinian, you'll find that there's a greater percentage in Jordan, actually. 
[01:55:00]  The territories which have been annexed, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip.  The Gaza Strip was formerly a part of Egypt.  The West Bank was formerly a part of Jordan.  These were territories that were won in war, in a war where Egypt and Jordan, along with four or five other Arab countries,  at the same time attacked Israel, Israel defended themselves, was able to fortify the borders, gain new territories,  and all of a sudden there are Palestinians. 
[01:55:30]  What happened to the people in Jordan?  What happened to the people who live in Egypt?  Those aren't Palestinians.  You're not worried about them.  You're just worried about the people in the areas that Israel gained defending themselves.  Yeah.  And then we have to give back this land to the people who don't exist,  and we're going to go ahead and uproot our people, okay, from the settlements that we created,  from terrain and land that we helped cultivate and turn into a – we made the desert bloom. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, yeah, sure, now you want the land.  Now that it's no longer our worthless piece of desert, now that we've turned it into something valuable,  sure, yeah, okay, no problem.  Gave it back as a nice gesture.  Well, let's uproot all our people that we gave subsidies to, that the government helped them in housing settlements  and all of these establishments in all of the territories that you talk about.  Let's pull them out.  We pull them out.  Here's the territory.  Let's put up a wall.  Keep them there.  Keep the Israelis where they should be.  End of story. 
[01:56:30]  You know, something ideal, I'm all for it.  But, ironically enough, when in the history of the world has a single nation ever given back land that it won in conflict?  Are we giving back land to the American Indians here?  Hell no.  We gave Montreal back.  Did we?  Yeah, we owned Montreal.  Did we win it?  I think we won that in a poker game.  We owned Montreal for, I don't know, a week or two.  We gave it back.  It's too cold up there.  I'm serious. 
[01:57:00]  Look it up.  Montreal is part of the United States?  What Americans don't understand is why we fund Israel is because Israel gave back Egypt land that they took in the Six-Day War.  Yes.  Which, if Israel kept that land, they would have no problem with financial from all the oil.  That's very oil-rich, correct.  But for the peace treaty, Israel gave back that land, and we said we would defend them and support, you know, military.  And everybody goes, why do you fund Israel?  Israel wouldn't have needed the funding if they would have kept that land.  We've always been a pal of ours, too, you know?  Oh, my God. 
[01:57:30]  Rich Voss knows something.  They're the one working democracy.  You actually know something.  Oh, I know a lot of things.  Ask me anything about crack.  Let's go to the phones.  Let's say hi to Anthony in Connecticut.  Anthony, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  I'm a huge Disturbed fan.  You know, I go to a lot of shows, and I say this with all due respect, but as a fan, when I go to shows, why do I have to hear the constant George Bush bashing, the war bashing between, like, all these songs?  You know, I go there to escape it, and I understand, like, you know, hey, music, politics has always been a part of music.  But when I go to the show, why do I have to hear, like, the anti-war, anti-Bush stuff all the time? 
[01:58:00]  It's just that, you know, I want to try and speak to the fans as a person, number one.  Number two, it's not always.  It's the occasional time.  And when I speak to people, I want to speak from my heart.  And it's not specifically Bush bashing.  It's bashing the whole administration's outlook on the value of the life of an American soldier.  I have an issue with war in and of itself, but, however, in this particular situation, it's more deep-rooted than that. 
[01:58:30]  And you've got to understand, we have fans of ours who are in the military all over the place, and we love them.  And they go into battle playing our songs, and I couldn't be more proud.  And, yeah, I will say that emphatically.  I could not be more proud that there are U.S. soldiers going into battle killing the enemy to our music.  I'm proud as hell. 
[01:59:00]  It is good kickin' ass music.  However, I value the lives of the soldiers apparently more than the president.  Well, we're getting back to you guys that they're actually playing Disturbed CDs as they're doing that.  Every day.  Every day.  Every day we meet new soldiers who tell us stories that they play before they go into battle, as they're going into battle, almost like an Apocalypse Now type of thing, you know, with the cavalry going in the helicopter.  So, to me, we have so many fans of ours that are in the military. 
[01:59:30]  It is a close personal issue to us.  And so it's hard not to say something about it when more and more U.S. soldiers' lives continue to be wasted in a part of the world that, ideally, we have absolutely nothing to do with.  Yeah, but you said that you would back Israel taking care of their own business.  Exactly.  Okay.  Israel.  Israel.  In fact, the U.S.  So you have a problem with Israel going to war?  Oh, not at all.  So it's Americans going to war for Israel?  It has nothing to do with the U.S. 
[02:00:00]  It has nothing to do with the U.S.  If Canada started lobbing missiles into the U.S., then, Godspeed, get the soldiers up there and start kicking some Canuck ass.  Get Nebraska to go after him.  And also, as a part of what I talk about, is that I also try to inspire a little bit of patriotism.  I get the crowd to chant USA, USA to try and, you know, inspire a little bit more positivity.  I try to speak about something that matters is really all that it is.  But don't you think Bush is more pro-Israel than Clinton was? 
[02:00:30]  On certain levels.  On certain levels.  On his Israel stance, I love Bush.  On everything else that the man is about, I can't stand it.  I think the caller was just a little peeved because he probably, as a Bush supporter, like maybe at the bar or something, talks to five or six of his friends and, you know, starts pontificating and stuff.  And you, unfortunately, have a giant audience to convey your feelings.  Well, I do understand his point about coming to the concert to escape all that. 
[02:01:00]  And I get it to a certain extent.  But, you know, if I'm going to speak and I like to try to address the audience at a couple different moments during the set because I like to treat them as people, not that we're just a band up there doing our job.  We go up there to play songs.  And when we leave, you know, I want to speak from my heart.  And I don't want to just, you know, say, yeah, rock and roll.  We're going to party all night and blah, blah, blah, blah.  I don't just want to throw out a bunch of drivel.  Right.  How about that Paris Hilton? 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  It's funny.  Hey, we got to take a break.  We can't.  We're so late right now.  We got Disturbed in the studio.  They're playing OzFest.  We got OzFest tickets.  We're giving away during the walk today.  You got like 15 pairs or something like that.  All right.  We'll talk to Disturb the phones.  Everyone has a comment now.  We'll hit the phones next.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hey, you're listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  Yep.  Okay.  The Opie and Anthony show.  That's right. 
[02:02:00]  And we got David, Dan, and Mike from Disturbed in studio getting a little serious right now.  That's all right.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  David, do you ever smile?  Yeah.  There you go.  All right.  Yeah, there's the smile.  All right.  I want to make sure you smile.  What do you find funny?  Because we've talked to you twice now, and I see a very seriousness to you.  What do I find funny?  Like if we say the wrong thing, you know, all of a sudden you're just going to jump up and  beat the crap out of us.  I've been laughing at you guys most of the show.  All right. 
[02:02:30]  Very good.  Good.  At, though.  Yeah, at, at.  An Arab falling in a manhole.  That's funny.  You know, he said that they play his music going into battle.  Well, that's weird that you would say that, because when they get back, they'll play my  DVD just for a little humor to laugh it up and play the Vos DVD.  No, it's to get the horrible images out of their head with new ones that are even more  horrible.  Your act.  Jesus.  It's like if you stub your toe, you got to cut yourself.  Yeah, you got to really make even more pain. 
[02:03:00]  That's what his DVD does.  Nice.  Let's say hi to Keith in Maine.  Keith, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey there, Keith.  Hey, you was talking about getting the troops and stuff revved up going into war.  My buddy Greg came home from Iraq, and we got to see Disturbed one of the times they've  been up here to Maine.  He was giving some shouts out to the troops, and I tell you what, man, that hit my buddy's  heart.  They listen to your music.  They listen to a bunch of stuff just to get pumped up every time they went into war, and  that hit them good.  That guy was complaining about hearing your take on the war and stuff. 
[02:03:30]  Well, you're an intelligent man, and when you speak, it causes people to listen, and  they can relate to you on a personal level.  And Keith, so a lot of the boys are playing Disturbed records when they're blowing up stuff.  Well, I don't know about when they were doing it, but before they went out to do stuff.  I'm just, I guess I'm setting this up.  I'm wondering if there's just one dope out there going, hey, I got a Barry Manilow CD  I want to play today.  Yeah, a tank rolling.  Dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventh. 
[02:04:00]  Fire.  Doesn't have the same impact, you know?  You need to disturb.  Oh, what a lonely boy.  Right.  You kind of think that there's one ass out there that, hey, I got a good idea.  Just the wimpy music.  Yeah, pulling out some dope CD.  It's like, dude, what's wrong with you?  Hey, Paul, the trucker, what do you got for Disturbed?  Hey, I just want to say that I'm in a unit in St. Louis, Missouri.  I've seen Disturbed in the pageant, which was a smaller place venue. 
[02:04:30]  It was awesome.  And we went overseas, and our theme song was Stupefied while we were blowing shit up.  So I was a trucker over there in my unit.  They dumped out because you cursed, but Stupefied was your song when you were blowing up stuff  over there.  Oh, yeah.  Something about that.  It's Free XM.  Yeah, we know.  That's all right.  Free XM.  You can't even get that right.  That's my goal.  I've been to a couple of Disturbed shows, and yeah, the vibe you get there is just the  energy in the audience is amazing. 
[02:05:00]  Just amazing.  You definitely want to blow something up when you listen to me.  No, it's a lot of energy, man.  Love it.  Love it.  Thank you, man.  Do the other guys talk, Dave?  Yeah.  Usually not this early, but it's a little too early for you guys.  How's Ozfest going?  Great.  It's real good, man.  Yeah.  Huge crowds.  Great, great vibe from it.  We love playing the sheds and playing to those large audiences and getting in front 
[02:05:30]  of 15,000 to 25,000 people every day is not too shabby.  It's good.  Yeah, it means things are working.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You want to sit there and hear when you throw the drumsticks out.  Tling, tling, tling, tling, tling, tling, tling, tling, tling, tling, tling, tling.  It actually happened.  It was a Warrant reunion show or something, and well past Warrant's heyday.  Small bar in Connecticut.  Small bar in Connecticut.  Small bar in Connecticut.  And the drummer does a little thing, man, and the song ends, and he goes, thank you, 
[02:06:00]  and he threw his sticks out, and you heard him hit the tile floor and go, tling, tling,  tling, tling, tling, tling.  He threw it over the crowd because everyone was pushed forward to make it look like there  was a lot of people in the club.  Oh, it was the worst.  We went to see the New York Dolls reunion, and they threw the drumsticks out, and an arm  went with it.  That's how old they are.  They just flew off as well.  Come on, I got it.  You deserve a crash.  I got to wreck you.  At what point do you stop going on tour?  Have you, like the New York Dolls, David Johansson, we're watching him. 
[02:06:30]  You're bringing up people for the better.  Isn't he dead?  He's on tour again.  No.  Now, the New York Dolls did a thing in New York a couple days ago.  He looks like an old Mick Jagger.  Wow.  That's actually a good point.  I would say as long as you can do it.  You can take somebody like Mick or the Rolling Stones.  Occasionally, I'm a pretty big cynic, but even seeing their performance at the Super Bowl,  I mean, they ripped it up. 
[02:07:00]  They can pull it off, though.  You know, it's amazing.  As long as you can do it.  Yeah, you see some other bands that just went a little too long.  We saw the Stones less than a year ago, about eight, nine months ago, was it?  At Giant Stadium.  They still have it.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable.  Isn't that amazing how many years and they're still, like, relevant?  Mick Jagger's energy is ridiculous.  And how old is he now?  65, maybe?  Yeah.  You're a band.  You hope to get, like, three good years, you know?  A couple good albums, maybe. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, that's it.  A lot to learn from a band like that.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Ellie in New Jersey.  Ellie, what's up?  Ellie.  David, how are you?  One of my Rebaim in high school was in Nevaeh with you.  Oh, yeah?  Which one?  Josh Cohen.  Oh, sure.  Yeah, he always used to say you did a great Kabbalah Shabbat.  Ah, yeah, I used to.  Ah, I used to.  I did?  And I saw the pictures from your brother's wedding online,  and I wish I could have been there to see you singing at it.  Yeah, it was pretty funny, man. 
[02:08:00]  Singing at a wedding?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that is cool.  I was drunk as a son.  Oh, man.  I think me and my brother, we used to actually do a couple things together  when we were kids, and, like, he would get on the keyboard,  and I'd start singing, and then they had me doing a couple Jewish songs  and whatnot.  Oh, wow.  That'll end up on YouTube somehow.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's go to Jason in New Jersey.  Jason, what's up?  Yo, boy.  Hey.  I'm just wondering, you know, with this whole thing in Israel, 
[02:08:30]  the Jews have been persecuted for thousands of years.  Isn't it about time they blow something up?  Oh, I'm with you, brother.  I thought he was going to say, maybe they deserve it.  Yeah, right?  That wouldn't sound like a setup, like, uh-oh.  I'm with you.  Let them do whatever they need to do to preserve a lasting peace within the country.  Because, you know, something, unfortunately, the impetus of all these organizations,  whether you're talking about Hezbollah or you're talking about Hamas, 
[02:09:00]  is not the establishment of a Palestinian state.  No.  It's not the establishment of a free Lebanon.  It's the complete extermination of the Jews and the destruction of the Jewish state.  If it was a homeland and a peaceful existence with people,  why aren't any of these people trying to do it through proper channels of civilized nations?  It's always through terrorism and even the talks,  they break down because someone's got to run into a bus with a bomb on them and animals. 
[02:09:30]  So, yeah, it's about time.  And the UN, irrelevant.  You know, they can't do anything.  There was a time when, you know, when the UN went in, they could keep the peace years ago.  Now, there's too much infighting.  There's too, you know, no one could, this one agrees, this one disagrees,  so nothing gets done.  It's politics as usual.  It's nice to see somebody, a country going in and defending itself and just, you know, 
[02:10:00]  oh, you're using too much force.  Too much?  You want to see too much?  Hey, we got the bomb, people, you know?  I think we're being nice.  And the thing is, when you talk about Middle Easterners like that,  the terrorists or whatever on stage, people get so uptight,  but you'll never hear like Arab, you'll never hear anything positive after,  you'll never hear like Nobel Peace Prize winner.  There's always destruction whenever you hear Middle East, you know,  you never invented anything, you know?  I think they invented yogurt.  They invented yogurt? 
[02:10:30]  No, that was just the crust on their bodies for not cleaning.  Exploding yogurt.  Fritch.  Fritch.  What?  But just the visual.  Let's say hi to George in Philly.  George.  George brings it to the gutter.  Hey.  What the hell's going on, man?  I feel like I'm listening to news radio right now.  I mean, what are we talking, politics?  Yeah, because we decided to, you know, take a break and maybe talk about something  that's huge in the world today.  Yes.  I haven't laughed in like 20 minutes.  Well.  I love the people that don't fully get this show. 
[02:11:00]  So, yeah, we make people laugh the majority of the time.  It's like 99% of the time we're goofing on stuff.  But there are times we do like to get serious and maybe talk about some of the stuff that  is happening out there.  Can you imagine him calling him on 9-11?  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Enough for ready.  Where are the jokes, all right?  Where are the jokes?  He sounds like a...  I haven't laughed in 20 minutes.  Come on.  I need a body part to be dismembered with a grinder.  This guy's got high standards.  What's the matter?  You didn't laugh enough today? 
[02:11:30]  You guys...  No, man.  You guys are killing me.  Come on.  I just did a thing about Arabs and nothing positive after their names.  A little funny humor there.  Ah, barely.  That was kind of a chuckle.  I'm with George on that.  That was like a chuckle.  All right, George.  George, this part of the show wasn't for you.  What can I tell you?  We can't make everybody happy.  It was great in the beginning, though, man.  All right.  Yeah.  I remember when we ruled at like 8 o'clock.  Hey, George, if you're...  Oh, forget it.  It's fine. 
[02:12:00]  You guys haven't made me laugh in like 30 seconds.  I enjoyed the start.  Come on, monkey.  Come on, monkey.  Dance.  And your take is interesting, and he's got...  Yeah.  He's got some personal...  Personal interest in what's going on over there.  Interest in the situation.  And Disturb rocks.  They're going to be at OzFest.  What's the local date on OzFest in Jersey?  When is it?  You guys know?  Actually, tomorrow is at...  Randall's Island.  Randall's Island.  Yeah, tomorrow, Randall's Island here in New York.  We got 15 pairs of tickets we're giving away in about five minutes right outside this building with Disturbed. 
[02:12:30]  Guys, thank you so much.  Thank you, brother.  Yeah, cool, man.  It's Dave, Dan, and Mike from Disturbed.  The other two guys really didn't talk.  They're tired or something.  I don't know.  Maybe next time we'll get into what you guys are all about, okay?  Sure.  Women and drinking.  And don't forget 10,000 Fists is in stores now.  Doing very well for you guys.  Thank God, man.  And really fast, McFoley called the show.  We couldn't get to him today.  He's an old friend.  He's promoting an appearance at the Camden River Sharks baseball game. 
[02:13:00]  He's going to be there this Sunday at noon in Camden, New Jersey.  All right, if you're not joining us over at XM, have a great weekend.  We'll see you Monday.  Rich Voss and Bonnie, Caroline's all weekend long here in New York City.  Thank you.  O.B. and Anthony XM 202.  The O.B. and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  God damn it, I just got caught. 
[02:13:30]  What happened?  I just got caught looking at that girl's tits.  Oh, did you really?  Because she's wearing...  Voss, you too?  Where?  Did you just get caught?  Oh, my...  No, I...  I was looking at her face.  I looked at her face, and then I'm like, she's wearing a top that was pretty revealing.  No, it's funny.  So my eyes went down real quick, and...  Because it's natural.  You just kind of look.  It's obvious that we have a rock band with us for the walkover today, Disturbed.  We got Dave, Dan, and Mike, because there's a couple hot women out here.  Yeah, and that never happens. 
[02:14:00]  That never happens when it's just O.B. Anthony and Jim Norton.  I was wondering.  I thought we were turning a corner, but no.  We're still at Dick Street.  And you notice that Rich Voss started with the Alzheimer's thing.  I'm like, what girl?  Where?  What?  What?  What?  Because Bonnie's right next door.  And I have emphysema.  He would totally...  He checks out girls in front of me all the time.  Why don't you girls...  Well, yeah, Rich is kind of a girl, too.  Why don't you guys check out this girl's boobs together, and...  Where is she?  Where's the blonde?  Yeah, she's over there.  Oh, she's hiding now?  She's over here now.  All right, that's what Anthony got caught looking at. 
[02:14:30]  It was like you kind of looked over and went, oh, okay.  Those are nice.  She's displaying.  I was looking at her pocketbook.  She's got a lovely T-shirt on.  She's trying to pull up her top.  Poor thing.  Now she's all self-conscious.  Why are you guys here?  Now she's all self-conscious.  It wasn't when she bought the shirt or put it on.  Hold on, hold on.  That's a good point, Rich.  I'm over here.  Hold on.  Why are you guys here?  You guys, man.  What's that?  Oh, wait.  This morning and drove from Boston because he loves you guys so much. 
[02:15:00]  Do you like us, too?  Yeah, I like you, too.  All right.  Everyone's looking at your boobs.  You know that, right?  It's all right.  It happens.  And you see Disturbed is out here with us?  Yeah, I saw.  Drove all the way from Boston.  Yeah.  Matt Damon without any work today.  Why not?  We got up at 4 just to drive down here.  Well, we're going to be in Boston next Friday.  I didn't know that, though.  We're halfway here, and we hear it on the radio.  We'll get a broadcast from BCN next Friday so you guys can save the trip.  But thanks for coming down to check us out.  We got some OzFest tickets. 
[02:15:30]  Well, you can't have them because it's for the New York show.  Are you here all weekend?  We'll drive back down.  The show's tomorrow.  Oh, it is?  Oh, boy.  We can do another run.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  We got OzFest tickets for the walk.  We're going to give them away down the road, though.  She could stay in our room tonight if she needs a place.  Great.  She'll end up like that girl on the cover of the paper.  And you want to explain to Dave what we do every day?  Yeah, because it's freezing inside.  Bonnie's asking me why I have a jacket, because it's freezing in the studios every day.  You've got your thermals on. 
[02:16:00]  It's going down to 90.  You wait until we get into XM, this shiver.  You're going to be cold, and I'm going to be wearing this laughing at you.  We wear winter clothes every day because it's so cold up there.  I hope it is.  Explain to Dave and the gang from Disturb what we do every day.  What, this walk?  Yeah.  It's dopey.  Two companies didn't want us to broadcast each other's show from the other company's studio,  so we have to now walk a block and a half to our XM studio.  And during the way, sometimes nothing happens at all. 
[02:16:30]  Sometimes huge things that make the news happen.  It's just a random walk down New York Street during, you know, when everyone's going to work.  So you see a lot of miserable faces of people that don't want to be here.  And we try to brighten their day up by either making fun of them or talking to them.  Anything that might happen.  You never know what's going to happen.  Or sometimes there might be.  It's captured on Pal Talk.  Are you on Pal Talk?  Yeah, we're on Pal Talk today.  Just imagine, guys, you have to do, like, half your show at one venue, stop in the middle of it, 
[02:17:00]  and then walk to another venue.  But you're playing on the way to the other venue a little bit.  Just kind of do a long jam.  That would suck.  You've got to at least do something.  And then you jump on another stage and continue the show.  That's pretty much what we do every day.  Or sometimes a comic book.  I want to go to, like, a Starbucks and do a set.  Oh, you want to do a set today?  Oh, that'd be fun.  Who wants to hear Rich Foss do a comedy set today?  What are we going to do at McDonald's?  McDonald's today?  You want to do it at McDonald's?  I don't know.  Will the mics work at McDonald's?  Have we ever tried it?  Haven't tried there. 
[02:17:30]  It's called the Starbucks Comedy Tour.  We go into the most awful.  We go into a place and try to do comedy to people that are eating breakfast,  and it's just so awful.  And have no idea.  Because they all stare as I bomb rapidly.  You want to do Roof 57 again?  The guy likes us over there.  Roof 57?  I'll do a spot.  It's a tough crowd.  Do a spot.  I had two people walk out and eat their breakfast the last time I went on.  Yeah, Rich's act could be a little offensive.  Well, the thing is, you're not really supposed to be doing comedy in a diner at 9 in the morning.  But I'll do a spot anywhere. 
[02:18:00]  That's how much I love comedy.  That's what he is.  You're a pro.  I'm a pro.  And we'll give out the OzFest tickets before he gets asked.  Lead the way.  All right, let's get out of here.  Let's walk down to Roo.  Someone's got to announce him, though.  Who's going to do that?  Who's taking over for Kenny today?  That's an impossible job.  Clef Soda Kenny is traveling with Jim Norton, so I believe Keith the Cop will be introing Rich Voss at Roof 57 in about 200 yards. 
[02:18:30]  Another muggy day.  This is great.  I don't know what material I'm going to do today.  There might be some repeat material, folks.  Uh-oh.  No, that you've heard in other restaurants.  Why?  Well, because you're not going to do a new set every time.  You don't want to waste.  I don't want to burn out some material.  And I don't know, you know.  Can you go old school today?  What, some of the old material?  Yeah, about your kids and stuff?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All right, I'll do some old school.  Let's do some retro. 
[02:19:00]  Retro Rich Voss today at Roof 57.  You know, because, I mean, if you come to college, it's all new material.  But, you know, at Roof 57, it's a tough crowd.  Ladies, come see a free show.  Nice talking to you.  They couldn't be bothered with you.  Look at this.  Security watching security.  All right.  Who's going to introduce me, though?  I need an intro.  I think Keith.  What, they got the A.C.?  Are they even?  Oh, there's people eating.  Oh, yeah, I've got to do it over here on this side. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, okay.  You've got to face in me.  Yeah, but I think we've got to walk in the front door.  Should I introduce myself?  See if that door is open.  Should I open for you?  You want to introduce me?  Hey, just walking to go, ladies and gentlemen.  Your first act tonight, today.  All right, Bonnie will intro.  What did he say don't do it?  Oh, we'll do it over here.  All right, Bonnie will intro Rich Voss at Roof 57.  Oh, my God.  This is so embarrassing.  Oh, wait.  Here, Bonnie.  Grab Rich's mic, and then you can hand it to him.  You've got to be nice and loud.  Wait, wait. 
[02:20:00]  Let our audience go in there, first of all.  This is so embarrassing.  Whoever wants to check out the quick three-minute comedy set for Rich Voss.  I can't watch.  It's one of those things so embarrassing, you can't watch it.  We get paid to do this, Dave.  Hey, it's a living, right?  It's horrible.  The manager just called me to keep it clean.  Oh, he just...  Keep it clean.  All right, the manager, who's a real...  Oh, that's going to be when they do that.  Well, the manager's a big fan of the Opie and Anthony show, and he told Rich just to  keep it clean.  That's...  All right.  Uh, Bonnie. 
[02:20:30]  You ready?  Tell Bonnie to introduce you.  I think everyone that's going in is in there.  Rich thinks he's hanging out backstage before he's going on.  Showdown?  Yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen, your first comedian this morning.  From Last Comic Standing, please welcome Richard Voss.  Wow.  Hey, how we doing?  It's good to see you guys.  We're going to do a little show, because my career is not going...  This is how pathetic my life is.  I owe my eight-year-old six dollars for Girl Scout cookies, and I'm dodging her. 
[02:21:00]  She calls me and tries to disguise her voice, but I know it's her, so go, hello?  Is Daddy home?  Not bad.  Sir, I'm doing a show you can watch.  Give me a few minutes, all right?  What's your name?  Newman.  Are you two married?  How long?  Unfortunately, I got a car, and I'm not like the black guys.  Well, anyhow.  Look, don't get upset, all right?  Turn on BET Comic View and watch black comics tricks, white people for an hour, all right? 
[02:21:30]  White people, crazy.  They pay taxes.  You know what I'm saying?  Loosen up.  We had the girl turn her back on me.  What country are you guys from?  Where are you guys from?  Oklahoma?  Oklahoma?  There's a nice little Oklahoma pub you might want to go to on 168th and Amsterdam.  It's called Run Whitey Run.  I'm killing it.  They're loving me.  This is the best crowd I've worked in a while.  How you doing, sir?  Do you work here?  What's your name?  What's that? 
[02:22:00]  Maurice, what was Lincoln like as a president?  How old are you?  I love to see you having sex.  Did I have an orgasm or break my hip?  Look at this waitstaff.  It looks like the United Nations is meeting here.  How you guys doing?  Wait, what country are you from?  Bangladesh.  Do you know a guy named Frank?  I love Bangladesh.  Whenever I played Risk, that was the first country I take.  Right into Bangladesh.  You live here now? 
[02:22:30]  It's great.  You don't have to walk down to the river to do your laundry?  Nothing on that one.  Come on.  They're from Bangladesh.  Look at dirt crack.  This is the best that I've had in a while.  Anyhow, folks, I got it wrong.  We just wanted to do a few minutes.  If you're in town tonight, come to Caroline, see the show.  Sir, you can get in free.  And we're giving out stool softeners, okay?  You guys were the best eight people I've ever worked to.  Thank you.  I can't believe he killed. 
[02:23:00]  Goodbye.  I'm pissed.  That pisses me off that he did so well.  You bastard.  You bastard.  Where's Bangladesh?  Bangladesh.  I hate that he did well.  Eight people.  And you had him.  And they were all turned around watching him.  Oh, you had them all.  Oh, God.  Oh, is that disturbing me that you actually killed in a restaurant?  Now we've got to get disturbed to do a set in there.  Yeah, that'll wake him up. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, yeah, the La Capella thing right here.  I'm going to go tell the manager to come down to Caroline's.  Hold on.  All right.  Thanks, Rich.  That was great.  Oh, Jesus.  That was all right.  Yeah, he did.  And I've seen him do worse than that at real comedy clubs.  Right, right.  Bangladesh.  Yeah, Bangladesh.  Bangladesh.  Only Rich.  I'd love to look at a map if Rich wrote it.  Oh, we've got people hanging out on the other side of the corner here.  How many tickets do we got? 
[02:24:00]  We got 15 pairs of tickets for OzFest?  Well, Opie and Anthony, virus, spread the virus poster.  Where are they?  Oh, we're just waiting for the light to change here.  See, we have to, our show actually has to stop, too, at traffic signals.  The show comes to a screeching halt.  Maybe we could blow the light here.  The show stops many times during the morning.  Blow the comedy stoplight that we've been standing at. 
[02:24:30]  Bet that guy's pissed.  He hasn't laughed in, like, 25 minutes.  Hey, our homeless friend's here.  Frederick Douglass is back.  We told him to go watch which movie?  Oh, we gave him money to go see Clerks 2.  All right, let's see if he saw Clerks 2.  Mac.  What's up, Mac?  What's up, bro?  He's wearing the Opie and Anthony Jimmy Day T-shirt.  How you doing, man?  Oh, look at this.  Mac.  Did you go see Clerks?  No.  God damn, I'm going this week. 
[02:25:00]  You're going this week?  Yeah.  No, we tossed you, like, I think we took up a collection and gave you, like, 100 bucks  to go see a movie.  That's all we asked from you.  That's all we asked.  I can see why you're homeless now.  Is that Adam Clayton?  We asked you to just see a goddamn movie, Mac.  What, were you busy?  I was sick.  Oh, you were sick?  What's wrong?  I don't know if I had pneumonia or something.  Pneumonia?  I don't know what.  I don't know what.  So good. 
[02:25:30]  I fucked up.  So good, man.  Yeah?  I've told you, you got to go see a doctor.  You know, go to the emergency room.  They got to take you, right?  Take you.  Yeah.  Do that next time.  And then go see Clerks 2.  I hear it's a scream.  Oh, it's hysterical.  We even give you money, you get some jujubes.  Or, you know what that is?  Raisinets?  Oh, yeah.  Goobers?  Yeah.  Yeah, you sit in a nice seat for a while, air conditioning, eating some candy, watch a 
[02:26:00]  good movie.  You do that next time.  All right, man.  We got a band with us today.  You ever hear of the band Disturbed?  No.  Band?  Yeah.  Rock band.  Never heard of Disturbed?  Yeah, they're pretty good.  Very good, as a matter of fact.  Here you go.  Now, get your ass to a movie.  Clerks 2.  We want your review.  Somehow, I don't think he's going to the movies with that 20. 
[02:26:30]  He never goes to the movies when we give him money.  Have a good week.  Take it easy, Mac.  Hope you're live on Monday.  All right, we're almost at XM.  We've got to give away the OzFest tickets.  How are we going to do this, by the way?  Anyone have an idea for the OzFest tickets?  Nothing.  Was that George Washington Carver?  No, it was...  Oh, Frederick Douglass.  Frederick Douglass.  Yeah.  He's our friend.  He does look like Frederick Douglass, doesn't he?  He's got a little Frederick Douglass to him.  Aw, dog geese. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, we try to get the story of him, like where it went wrong for him and stuff, but he doesn't  talk that much.  And we try to get him to do movie reviews, and eh.  He obviously didn't cooperate.  No.  Not very cooperative.  I would guess if he could, like, hold a schedule and do things that he was told, he'd have  a job and a home.  So, I think we're the idiots here on this one.  All right.  Here's where we're going to give away some tickets.  Yeah, we should stop right here.  Does Steve have an idea for the tickets? 
[02:27:30]  You know, I just...  We have a...  Spill my guts in that diner.  Don't get a penny.  He sits on a street corner.  You get him $100.  Oh, and I slipped him, you know, at $20.  Rich, throw your headphones on so you know what's going on.  Steve.  Gotta give him something.  OzFest tickets.  16 pairs of OzFest tickets for tomorrow night show at Randall's Island.  Who wants OzFest tickets?  It might not be that bad.  We might have a pair for everybody here.  Actually have a pair for everybody.  All right.  Raise your hand if you want the OzFest tickets.  Why is Dave from Disturb raising his hand? 
[02:28:00]  All right.  Goat Boy.  Nice T-shirt there.  Goat Boy.  All right.  We're handing out the OzFest tickets.  This is just so exciting.  Steve's doing a great job.  It's incredible.  The frenzy is unbelievable.  Oh, my God.  No, no, no, no, no.  This is like Shark Week.  I don't know what's going to happen.  Shark Week.  Oh, wait.  See?  You missed that.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  What happened?  He accidentally gave them two pairs and had to grab one back.  The excitement was shocking.  Controversy on the sidewalk here. 
[02:28:30]  Jesus.  Who else?  How many left, Steve?  Steve.  Oh.  This guy, the Buccaneers guy.  Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  Four pairs or?  Left.  Four pairs.  Four pairs left.  That's it?  Got four pairs left.  Anybody?  Anybody?  Come on, Disturb.  Headline, Michelle.  That's right.  That gentleman over there.  Oh, he works for us.  Well, you could give out.  Just give out some more. 
[02:29:00]  Who else wants the OzFest tickets?  I think there's a couple walking up right now would want them.  Yeah, right.  The spinners will be there.  Spinners.  All right.  And the last pair of OzFest tickets.  They go, too.  Anybody?  Everyone got a pair.  There you go.  All right.  We gave them all out.  Very nice.  Sound off like you got a pair.  OzFest at Randall's Island tomorrow night with Disturbed.  All righty. 
[02:29:30]  I'm ready to go inside.  I think I have to Purell my hand.  I think it might have touched Mac.  Hey, thanks, man.  He was using this mic.  Damn it.  It sounded like he had tuberculosis or something.  Yeah, I know.  What's up?  I definitely need some Purell.  Are we saying goodbye to you guys?  I think we are.  Anthony, we're losing Disturbed.  You guys, let's hear it for Disturbed.  Dave, Dan, and Mike.  Thank you, brother.  See you at OzFest tomorrow night at Randall's Island.  Thanks, guys.  We appreciate it.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you, guys.  We've got to get inside and continue the O.P. and Anthony show.  We'll be upstairs in just a few minutes. 
[02:30:00]  Guys, have a great weekend.  The war is the XM2K.  Messicans.  That sucks.  Lesbians.  I like that in a woman.  And every other kind of TV.  I love paying for sex.  This moral decay weakens our resistance.  Dude.  The onslaught of the communist masters of disease.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass. 
[02:30:30]  I can't believe it.  It's pedophile humor.  Woo!  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for power.  Here it comes!  Here it comes!  The O.P. and Anthony program.  The O.P. and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bat to my brain.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  O.P.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that back.  Jim Norton. 
[02:31:00]  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down Syndrome children.  No, baby!  That's terrible.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  The O.P. and Anthony. 
[02:31:30]  I don't have my headphones on yet.  I'm sure-relling my hands.  When I handed Mac the 20, I always do it like I just pulled a piece of it so he can grab  it.  But this time, he kind of brushed my thumb a little bit. 
[02:32:00]  So I held my hand out all the way until we got upstairs and now I'm just sure-relling  the hell out of my hand.  For the first time, I need that stuff.  He was using my mic and it sounded like death was coming out of his lungs.  Yeah, he sounds like a motor ready to blow when he talks.  It's just that grumbling.  There you go.  He even said, I'm not doing too good.  I'm not doing too good.  Pneumonia.  All right.  I had the pneumonia. 
[02:32:30]  Pneumonia.  I'll say hi to Adam in New York.  I think so.  Adam, what's up?  That was creepy.  Yeah, I was on the walk over and Voss was the best set ever.  I've been to all of them and he killed today.  And I've said it before and I'll say it again.  His girl, Bonnie, is just way too hot for him.  Yeah, we all know that.  That's everybody knows.  Stop.  The sky is blue.  We breathe air.  It's just known.  I'm actually kicked ass today. 
[02:33:00]  We really don't know why they're together because we've all seen Voss' cock.  It's not because he has a big one.  Yes, I got a nice one.  No, you don't.  That's why you always show his actual size.  You think that's wrong?  You think that's big?  That's cute.  No, I got a regular, I got a decent one.  And those tiny little hands of yours, yeah, maybe it does look big.  Rich Voss is a very kind human being.  And that's why you're with him?  Yeah, he's...  Well, that has nothing to do with the other size?  Wow, that sounds like love.  No, no, he has a big cock.  That sounds like real love, doesn't it? 
[02:33:30]  Rich Voss is a very kind human being.  Like a Hedda Nussbaum response.  Did you see how she said you have a big cock?  It was so believable.  You know what he did one night after one of his shows, this woman, we were in Atlanta?  This woman came up to us and was like, oh, great show, Rich, I love you, you're so funny.  And he goes, you look like that girl in Sopranos, Tony's sister.  You know which girl?  Oh, my God.  And her face falls.  Of course. 
[02:34:00]  And he doesn't read people very well.  He starts hitting me.  Doesn't she look like her?  Read people or anything else?  Doesn't she look like her?  And the girl goes, oh, why are you saying that?  Do you think I'm fat?  He goes, no, no, no, your face.  You're falling in the face.  Yeah, that's always good.  That's going to help.  Boy, you know, I would love to just rip Rich apart because it's so much fun when we do.  But how can you say anything bad about that?  You went into a place where anyone would fail and you fucking killed it. 
[02:34:30]  And it upsets me that people are laughing.  They were participating.  They stopped eating.  They were happy.  They stopped eating.  They turned around.  They were laughing.  It was old people, family.  They were giving away their hometowns.  I was disgusted at your success.  I couldn't get past Bangladesh.  Bangladesh.  Bangladesh.  Bangladesh.  That's great.  Nino, Nino, Nino.  What do you got?  Three people.  I wanted to tell that goddamn rich boy that he killed and I laughed so hard. 
[02:35:00]  I almost drove off the road when he was talking about the black people and now the white people  pay taxes.  Oh, thank you.  Right on, man.  Yeah, them white people are crazy.  Going to the movies and not talking.  Holding down a job and shit.  Knowing where they kids live.  Let's say hi to Dan.  Dan in Nashville.  Dan?  Yeah, I just wanted to say little Jimmy is fucking killing out here in Nashville.  We saw him last night.  We're going back again tonight.  Oh, very cool.  Yeah, we had a special appearance by Frank the Frowner and everything. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, wow.  It is wonderful.  He's got Janies, isn't he?  Yeah, a lot of Opie and Anthony fans there.  There was a shitload of them, man.  At least over half of the place there was Opie and Anthony.  The other half was from Lucky Louie.  Oh, very cool, man.  Hopefully we can get Jimmy to call the show before we leave here for the weekend.  All right.  You guys suck.  Thanks, Dan.  Punching out.  Okay.  Let's say hi to Alonzo in New York.  Alonzo.  Alonzo.  I was just on the walkover and I got to thank Steve for the ticket, but when he was handing 
[02:36:00]  to me, I was looking at his tattoos, I noticed that his pores are so big on his shoulder.  I thought someone was going to jump out and bite me.  He's got large pores.  Well, because he waxes.  He waxes and fluxes.  What you're looking at, usually there's big, thick Lebanese hair growing out of him.  Yeah.  He's got...  That's so awful.  Well, we were talking yesterday.  The kid has so much hair that by the time he's done shaving everything he needs to shave,  which is most of his body, he's got to start over.  Who's his? 
[02:36:30]  Steve.  Steve.  Have you seen him?  No.  Our own Steve.  He's got to shave his body?  Yeah.  He shaves everything.  Ooh.  I didn't know he was a very bear.  I do the summer trim down myself.  I go for a summer trim down.  That's about it.  I didn't know he was Lebanese.  Shorter arm hair.  That's all I'd do.  Look.  A little clean up there.  And I'd do the back.  A little back wax.  Why would you do your arms?  You wouldn't shave your arms.  What's the...  He trims it.  Honestly, I just trim it.  It's not down to the skin.  I've got hair because I want to still be known as a man.  What do you got?  Really hairy arms?  Yeah.  Well, it's almost like a sleeve where the short sleeve would stop or whatever. 
[02:37:00]  From that down, it gets kind of long.  What?  So I just clean up a little.  That's all.  What do you got to shave?  Like you shave your whole body?  No.  Just my arms.  Someone was commenting on...  You're such a liar.  You shave your chest, your shoulders, your back.  Well, I'm sorry.  Your face into a different pattern every day.  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  Is that on?  No.  Of course.  Why would the mic be on?  Why would the mic be on?  Why would it be? 
[02:37:30]  Now I'm doing it.  Smoothie?  No, thank you, Keith.  No smoothie today.  How come this is not so good?  They clean the mics every day here.  There you go.  I don't like that.  Everyone say, God, this girl is obsessed.  Holy shit, I hung up on you five times.  Yes, Ryan.  Hello there.  How are you?  Good.  You do know I hung up on you how many times?  Three times?  Four times?  Yeah, three times.  It wasn't very nice.  All right.  Because you're going to be... 
[02:38:00]  You let me through, so it's all good.  All right, go ahead.  Okay, so, Opie and Anthony, love you guys.  Stood in line in Vegas to get my picture with you, the whole thing.  But your little buddy Voss, let me tell you, his show on Sunday sucked.  Where was it?  It really sucked.  Sunday?  Where was I Sunday?  Where were you?  The funny farm, and you weren't funny, buddy.  Are you out of your mind?  Yes, he was.  I killed on Sunday.  Hang up on her against you.  No, don't hang up on her.  Don't hang up on her.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Wait, first of all...  Shut up.  Are you out of your mind? 
[02:38:30]  If you call heckling, funny, then, you know...  Oh, you're out of your mind.  You're out of your mind.  You're a dummy.  Well, heckle, heckle, and heckle.  We called Jimmy at...  Oh, we saw Jimmy.  Jimmy was funny.  Okay, first of all...  Jimmy is funny, but Rich was hilarious that night.  He was a genius.  I would pay over and over.  Listen, you...  Shut up, you guys.  Fat nobody.  Listen to me, you fat nobody.  Listen to me.  Shut up, cunt.  Listen to me.  That's why you don't find it funny, because you won't shut your fat face.  Let me tell you something.  First of all, Sunday... 
[02:39:00]  Look, if I have a bad show, I'll say it.  Believe you me.  I'm the first on stage, which barely happens.  I've been doing this 23 years.  But Sunday...  You don't have to defend yourself.  No, no, let me explain that about these dumb callers.  Also, didn't you hear everyone else around you laughing hysterically?  Sunday night was probably one of the best shows.  I love Bonnie, man.  You were good.  The claws.  The claws.  My wife is hilarious.  Shut your fucking mouth.  The claws.  I am very funny, but...  She's not that bad.  She kind of...  She's growing on you now, Bonnie. 
[02:39:30]  See, the best joke you had was about...  What two seats were you sitting in?  Because...  But the only reason it works is because you have a small vagina.  Where were you sitting?  That's freaking hilarious.  Where were you sitting?  Does she shut up?  Takes her a week to suck a dick, all the talking she does.  Where were you sitting?  You wouldn't know, buddy, but you might want to.  Hey, Ryan.  Oh, why?  Hold on.  Why the obsession with Rich?  Why?  Why call a show that you like to say that Rich sucks? 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, and why didn't you say something?  Why didn't you get up and walk out if it wasn't any good?  Yeah, there you go.  Why would you...  If I'm at a movie that stinks, I'll get up and walk out.  So, why didn't you walk out?  Because we paid good money and we...  Oh, you didn't pay good money on Sunday.  Shut up.  Listen, listen.  It was a birthday present to my better half, okay?  Your better...  Everything's your better half.  Hopefully it starts below your ankles.  If you were for your wife, then you would have, you know...  Yeah, I know.  I know.  Your wife was all good.  She's very funny.  Don't try to get on her good side. 
[02:40:30]  I know.  I'm having a hard time taking sides now.  She's dividing and conquering and it's working.  But listen to me.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  Listen to me, Redneck Comedy Tour.  But Rich was really funny then.  I don't know what show you were watching, but I sat and watched the whole show.  Shut up.  I watched the whole show and I thought it was funny.  Could you guys just let me do this?  Because I really don't want the phone calls from Rich Voss all weekend.  Yeah.  Because he's so insecure.  Phil in Atlanta.  Yeah.  I was at the Friday night Voss show and not only was Voss and his wife very funny, but 
[02:41:00]  they're awful human beings.  And I was there with my friend and I told her, I'm like, we're sitting on the back wall  as far away as possible because I'm not having a room full of people laughing at me.  Sure enough, every single person in the pit caught shit.  This poor gay guy that wouldn't leave alone.  Oh yeah, that's right.  I remember him.  All right.  So thumbs up or down for Rich Voss? 
[02:41:30]  Oh, please.  Thumbs up.  You know what happened?  You said something to someone.  It might have even been her.  A little too close to home.  And now you suck.  Yeah, because look, here's Mike in Atlanta.  Mike?  Yeah, man.  I went to the Friday show and Voss and Monty both kicked ass.  Man, that bitch don't know what she's talking about.  All right.  There you go.  And I got you a DVD, Voss, and it was funny as fuck, man.  This man sounds intelligent.  Thank you.  No, but I think it's on to something.  Let's try this out here.  Ryan.  Yes.  What got to you that Rich Voss said? 
[02:42:00]  And be honest.  If you listen to the O.B. and Anthony...  It was all the heckling.  No, it was just...  All the heckling.  Wait a minute.  It's called crowd work.  It's original comedy.  You know, when I go to a comedy show, I want to hear some funny stuff.  What's more original, though, than off the cuff, like...  Absolutely.  ...taking, beating down somebody that's in the audience, maybe heckling or...  Working in the moment.  I'm going to pay for your mama so fat, she...  I didn't do any of that shit.  No, never.  It's done to your mama.  But I'm just using that for example, okay?  Of course.  But here's the deer.  And by mama, you mean you.  Here's the deer. 
[02:42:30]  Yes.  Rich said, here's the deer.  All right, yes.  Here's the deal.  Listen to me.  Here's the deer.  Listen to me.  Here's the deal.  Ryan, listen.  No, hold on.  Ryan, if you called the show right now and said, hey, I saw Voss's show.  I don't think he's funny.  It's not my type of comedy.  Cool.  But when you're speaking for everybody going, the show sucked.  That's where people get pissed off.  It didn't take...  Because you had to acknowledge that everyone was laughing.  Something happened because Ryan called three or four times and we just didn't feel like 
[02:43:00]  going there, but she had to keep calling back.  I'm sure that Ryan, I did something about an uncle touching somebody or being overweight.  Did something hit home, Ryan, that he said?  I tracked her better half, probably.  Well, you trashed us all because we were on the front row.  All right.  We're getting to something.  All right.  Okay.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Now, now, let's be honest here with each other.  So you were one of the people that Rich spoke to from the stage?  Well, yeah.  He spoke to everybody.  Okay. 
[02:43:30]  No, no, no.  I understand.  What did you say about you or one of your friends?  That's what we're trying to get to.  Specifically, what was said to you or one of your friends?  Okay.  He called...  Come on.  Just be honest.  He said that I looked like I was mating with owls.  Oh, she had big eyes.  All right.  Now, we're getting to the bottom of this.  I love this.  This show's like fucking Columbo.  Thank you.  Vincent DiCaprio got to the bottom of this.  Now, wait.  Y'all have to understand, though. 
[02:44:00]  A little heckling is fun.  Get the terminology correct.  It's not a heckling.  The reality is...  It's called crowd work.  The crowd heckles.  Hold on.  The reality is heckling is fun until it's directed at you.  No, no, no.  We knew we were going to be heckled when we wanted to heckle.  It's not heckling.  It's not heckling.  It's called crowd work.  It's crowd work.  All right.  The crowd heckles the comic.  Right, right.  Who then must return the heckle with crowd work.  Okay.  What I don't understand is when that guy pretended to cut his throat with a bicycle grinder,  why did you get so upset? 
[02:44:30]  Okay?  I know.  You fucking boob.  So what else?  Jody!  Now, Ryan, besides the owl remark, what else was said to, like, the group you were in?  Somebody else in the group.  Well, we were, my, whatever, sister-in-law was told to quit using her ghetto fan because  the air conditioner was broke.  So she was using paper to fan herself.  Now I know exactly who they are.  God damn, that's hysterical.  She was laughing really hard. 
[02:45:00]  I remember them.  Yeah.  All right.  And anybody else in your crowd that Rich talked to?  And they were biggums.  Yeah.  They were biggums?  Yeah, kind of.  You know, you would dip your arm in cheese and nibble on it between pizzas.  Okay?  Okay.  Not funny, Richard Voss.  No.  What, what, what?  You're not going to be kidding me.  What's that?  I weigh 108 pounds.  I'm a biggum.  Oh, then the other one was.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Well, whatever.  What else did I say?  Okay, whatever.  Okay, so you called her boyfriend a terrorist when he's damn Greek. 
[02:45:30]  So, Greek.  So, they all look like dark-skinned.  Like, you can't look, I have a Greek guy that looks like he's an Arab.  I don't, I don't have time to ask what country you're from.  Yeah.  You know, I know, listen, here's the thing, miss.  Okay.  Okay, here's the thing.  You raked her, you raked her people with machine gun fire.  Yeah, the whole table.  Yeah.  A little heckling is fun.  I'm heckling.  If you get on the front row and there's only, you know, 50 people there, hello, I know  that's going to happen, and that's fine.  A little bit of it's okay, but listen, let's use the other show, for instance. 
[02:46:00]  Wait a minute, let me explain.  He might have heckled one person, but his show was fun.  You're right.  It's not heckling.  Okay, okay.  Okay, can you, are you going to compare, can you compare Led Zeppelin, are you going to  compare Led Zeppelin to 50 Cent, we're two different, are you going to compare Picasso  to Rembrandt, listen to me.  That's what Rich does, he does crowd work, he says it's very hard to do, hardly anyone  can do it.  Or Led Zeppelin to great wife.  Yeah.  Right.  You know, here's the thing, I have, I have tons. 
[02:46:30]  He's not smart enough to understand.  I understood that one.  I have, here's the thing, I have, here's the thing, miss, I could do some material for  two hours, I get bored, Sunday, plus when I'm working the crowd, it's not heckling,  but I'm working the crowd.  No, I want to explain to her, so I'll give her a little knowledge.  Do you want to give people knowledge sometimes?  We get the reviews when you guys hit the road.  Oh no, we never fail, we never fail.  It's not that, I'm trying to explain to her.  You never fail?  I fail.  No, you didn't fail, you were the funny one.  Oh, see, they do this to Ant and I all the time.  That makes Bonnie look bad. 
[02:47:00]  Her saying you're good.  I know, actually, yeah, right?  Now that's a backhanded compliment that's not even a compliment.  Alright.  That's an insult.  Alright, Ryan, you get it out of your system.  Say, Ryan, anyhow, in August.  Next time you come to Atlanta, maybe you'll try a little comedy.  Next time I come to Atlanta, please don't come to the show.  But here's the deal.  In August, my DVD will be in stores if you'd like to buy that.  There's a lot of material.  There's no heckling, alright?  No heckling?  Yeah.  Oh, heckling.  Your husband must hate you.  Alright.  Enjoy the owls.  But the thing is, that's a style of comedy that's really difficult to do. 
[02:47:30]  And Rich Voss does it better than anyone.  He really does.  I love his crowd work.  I love his crowd work.  I've seen him, like, a thousand times and I'll still watch him if I say,  just do crowd work and I'll watch you.  And he does it the whole show.  No one can do that.  You know what I learned from the whole thing?  And it's very sweet.  Bonnie is in love with Rich.  I learned that, like, she's always ragging and stuff, but holy shit.  When that bitch opened up on Rich.  I loved it.  You put on the fucking claws, man. 
[02:48:00]  Well, because if Rich had had a bad show, which I've seen happen twice, where he really  has, like, eaten it, I would have, like, but he didn't.  He was getting laughed.  He was being really funny.  Sunday night, remember, there was two full tables of Jewish seniors there.  It was a difficult show.  There were 40 Jews that were there thinking water is part of the minimum.  All right.  Thank you for sticking up, you guys. 
[02:48:30]  All right.  All right.  All right, Adam, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  What?  Hey, we're just driving home from work there.  We're wondering if you guys could crank out some of those buttery beats for us for a ride  home.  Fuck the buttery beats.  Hey, Derek, you got a buttery beat to calm everyone down?  I hate the buttery beat.  Yeah.  The buttery beat.  They're not buttery.  Yeah, listen to this.  It's gay sex.  No, this is gay sex.  How do you distinguish this from buttery beats?  This is not a buttery beat.  This is a buttery beat.  That's man sex music. 
[02:49:00]  But so are buttery beat.  No, they're not.  There's a difference.  Oh, my God.  Tell me the difference.  Give me Sean.  Now play a buttery beat.  Give me Sean.  This is a buttery beat.  Gay sex music.  No.  And this isn't a buttery beat that you gave the example of last time.  No, this was the last buttery beat we played.  Because this is from the actual game where I got the term buttery beat from.  Listen to this.  Luminous.  Ass sex music.  This isn't ass sex.  This might be.  Steve is dancing in the control room.  It's gay.  No, this isn't ass sex music. 
[02:49:30]  It might be man-to-man kissing music.  But it's not ass.  I mean, all right, look.  Maybe.  Prelude to ass sex.  This is like maybe a little fondling.  But this is a buttery beat.  I would never listen to this.  Give me the ass sex music again.  Listen, I'm going to teach you something.  This is ass sex music.  All right.  Ass sex music. 
[02:50:00]  Man-on-man deep tongue kissing.  It's a buttery beat.  No, see?  Hold on.  Yeah.  Give me the other music.  And then play the clip.  There's a difference there. 
[02:50:30]  I see the difference.  But the buttery beat you were playing like a week ago or earlier in the week was just like this.  No, because Derek didn't know what a buttery beat was, so we went with this music.  Derek doesn't know what anything is.  This is a buttery beat.  See?  It's very buttery right there.  Are we calmed down?  Yeah, we're all calmed.  Everyone zippers down.  Our cocks are out.  Jesus, what this music does to you.  Buttery beats and lush looks.  Lush looks.  Read the back of the luminous box. 
[02:51:00]  All right.  Enough.  All right, we're going to take a quick break.  Let's see.  Let's say hi to Wheel in Jersey.  Wheel?  Hey, what's up, buddy?  How you doing, man?  All right.  Hi.  Yeah, I just got to say, Voss slayed today on the walkover.  He was so funny in that.  All right.  Thank you.  I just want to let you know, man.  Voss, you're pretty good.  Normally, you suck.  Why does everyone say that?  The line about taking a week to suck a dick was phenomenal.  That killed.  Thank you.  All right, boys, you suck. 
[02:51:30]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's say hi to Tom in California.  Tom, what's up?  Hello, sirs.  Hey, Tom.  I just want to say one of my favorite things about this show is because Mudder Mouse, Rich  Voss, fuck up his words.  Here's the deer.  Here's the deer.  Here's the deer.  Mine was Bangladesh.  Bangladesh.  Bangladesh.  Oh, did I say that?  Yeah.  Yeah, you did.  There's a couple more.  Hey, Voss, even though you're a Mudder Mouse, me so like you. 
[02:52:00]  Thank you.  Thank you, Tom.  Why don't we take a break?  We'll continue.  We got Joel Siegel's movie reviews.  We got the Lance Bass stuff.  Yes.  Ah, yes.  Lance Bass.  We got...  Oh, my God.  We're doing Stoner Spelling Bee today?  Oh, shit.  Do we have enough time?  We could start at 10, I guess.  Sure.  All right.  We'll start Stoner Spelling Bee at 10.  Get our contestants and get them smoking a lot of dope.  We'll do that in a few minutes.  But first, these messages.  Well, we got some audio from the Tonight Show appearance. 
[02:52:30]  Opie and Anthony.  It's great.  I like the hottest guys on radio.  Wow, that's really nice.  Really nice.  Opie and Anthony's show on XM Satellite Radio.  It starts with an O&A plug before headlines.  Opie and Anthony's show on XM Radio.  Very nice.  Test tested.  Leno approved.  They plugged us like three times last night.  Yep.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The hottest show on the road.  The hottest show on the road.  The hottest show on the road.  The hottest show on the road.  The hottest show on the road.  The hottest show on the road.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, boy.  Take three.  I just want a cup of coffee.  Oh, no.  Without Kenny here, man.  Things get a little shaky, huh?  Yeah.  He's going to be my Manny someday.  Yeah.  He's going to walk my kid around the neighborhood.  He's got one of those front baby carriers.  Most people call them girlfriends, Opie. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, but you need some help, I think.  If you could afford some help with your kids, wouldn't you?  See, no, I mean walk your kid around.  See, most people call them girlfriends.  She's not a kid anymore.  She's not a kid anymore.  He's not a kid.  Well, what?  Ten years has passed?  Two years.  Iliketolisten.com.  What?  Iliketolisten.com is a website you should be checking out.  Oh, what? 
[02:54:00]  I'm sorry.  I wasn't listening.  On a regular basis.  Basically, E-Rock and the gang, they try to come up with some questions that have something  to do with the Opie and Anthony show.  And you can take some polls.  Wow.  Parking costs a lot of money.  From time to time, Iliketolisten.com.  Oh, boy.  You might have to go back and forth.  Oh, no.  Oh, Jesus.  How about you just bring the milk?  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, let's just.  What did he do?  What did that idiot do?  Oh, he's still in the room.  It's like, my coffee's like Mickey Rivers black, and I want it to be more like Halle Berry black. 
[02:54:30]  I know.  I like the water in mine to dilute it.  It's like drinking tar.  So, Iliketolisten.com is a fine website you should throw on your favorites and take a poll every  once in a while.  All right?  All right.  Rich Voss and Bonnie in the studio.  They're playing Carolines this weekend here in New York City.  Let's see.  Oh, boy.  I know this is some kind of setup.  Jay in Massachusetts.  What's up?  Yeah, listen.  I just want to defend you up on the whole buttery beat situation.  I really don't think it's gay music. 
[02:55:00]  I just, you know, when you come up to Framingham and all, you can just kind of get this in the  mood.  I just had a little phobia about fireplaces and all.  Oh, boy.  He's bringing it up.  You're killing me.  Fireplace.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  What do you do with myself?  He just flushed himself down the toilet like a piece of shit that he is.  That was funny.  That's hilarious.  All right.  Let's go to Lance Bass.  We jumped on this yesterday, and it seems like he's been jumping on some stuff.  You jumped on Lance Bass yesterday? 
[02:55:30]  He came out of the closet.  Yeah.  I guess everyone knew.  Lance Bass was gay.  Everyone knew.  He finally admitted it, and he's dating some reality show star.  The winner of the Amazing Race.  Amazing Race.  Amazing Race.  Season 40.  Nice.  Whatever.  Wow.  That's a good show, the Amazing Race.  See, that's one show I never got into, and I hear it's one of the best reality shows.  Yeah, it's good.  I just didn't check it out.  We were goofing yesterday because we went through a few of the older interviews that people did  with Lance Bass and talking about, like, you know, hey, how about the girls? 
[02:56:00]  And, you know, we hear you were seen with this girl and that one, and he's so uncomfortable.  Just, yeah, girl, me, with.  Like, you didn't even know how to react to it because it's so obviously gay, and people  didn't want to call him out on it.  And we brought this up yesterday, we'll say it again, I've seen this on Regis, and we  can't say who he was talking to because, you know, we would get sued because these  people haven't come out of the closet yet, but you'll see, like, Regis talking to some 
[02:56:30]  celebrity.  Everyone in the world knows he's gay, but stupid Regis, oh, why don't you have a lady?  When are you going to marry him?  And you're like, holy, would someone tell this guy behind the scenes what the buzz in  Hollywood is?  He's just stupid.  Come on, Liberace, when are you getting married?  And even ask, what seems to be the problem?  Why don't you have a girl in your life?  You look like quite a stud.  Right.  Why don't you settle down like that Rock Hudson fella?  You know, he's another good-looking fella that was settled down already. 
[02:57:00]  That is so good.  But you watch this, like, he can't be this stupid.  But maybe he's busting their balls.  You think he's busting their balls?  Nah.  He's not that smart.  You would think his producers would go, you know what?  People are saying.  His producers?  He's just, Gellman, where do you get in the girl?  Holy shit, I got a faggot for a producer.  That's so mean.  What's up?  He's just a doddering old fool.  That's his.  Give him everything.  Not his vault. 
[02:57:30]  They give him everything, though, man.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't get it.  Because he has to be with a...  That America's Got Talent is a pretty good show.  Uh-huh.  But he stinks.  I heard it's dropping off.  It had an initial really big good rating.  And now it's just like...  He's like a robot up there.  Yeah.  The whole thing with that stupid game show he was on.  Well, Millionaire.  Right, right.  Yeah.  And then what happened to that?  After a while, they replaced it.  It's still on, apparently.  In all fairness to that show, it was such a hit that they just killed it.  It was on too much. 
[02:58:00]  Too much.  Because they're talking about that with Deal, No Deal.  You know, they want to protect that franchise because it's such a huge hit for, what is  it, NBC?  I think so, yeah.  That's what I meant.  So they're like, the new season's going to happen, and they're like, we're going to  try to control this and not have too much on the air, because they know that's what  killed Millionaire.  Overkill, yep.  But Deal or No, that's what America's come down to.  Yes or no?  Yes, no.  Know what, though?  What?  The concept of the show stinks, but Howie Mandel just pulls it off.  He's a great host.  Yeah.  There's something about how he plays it with the contestants and the banger. 
[02:58:30]  Welcome to Coin Toss.  And the hot chicks with the briefcase, he just pulls off that show.  I watch for him.  That's it.  This fall on Fox, Coin Toss, Heads or Tails?  And just go like two guys, heads, tails, big light show, big like fancy graphics.  Followed by odds and even.  And once, twice, three, we'll be back with shoot after these words. 
[02:59:00]  Damn it.  Paper.  I'll wait for shoot.  Paper, rock, scissors.  Classy graphics and set.  On NBC.  Turning shit into something with graphics and lighting.  Well, Regis isn't funny at all.  Remember when we did the Donald Trump roast, he hosted, didn't have a funny line throughout  the day.  No, nothing.  How about his hair?  Oh, yeah?  What about it?  Punch line.  Doesn't it look silly?  Yeah.  8,000 jokes about his hair?  Come on, Regis.  When you're heckling the dais, have a punchline. 
[02:59:30]  Heckling.  Let's go to Greg in Canada.  Greg.  Hey.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  You guys are fantastic.  Oh, and you suck, too.  But at the same time, Rich Boss, that was fantastic.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  I laughed my ass off so hard.  You made...  Hey, what was that thing you talked about?  Oh, the bumps.  Hey, hey.  Did you ever get the bumps for your birthday?  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  All right.  Wait a minute.  This stupid Canadian thing.  We love our Canadians, and we hate them at the same time. 
[03:00:00]  I love our brothers to the north, but yes, they have some silly things.  Well, explain what the bumps are.  Explain the bumps.  That's where a bunch of your quote-unquote friends hold you from the front.  I mean, I'm going to get descriptive.  It could get a little bit, you know, nasty.  How nasty?  You could say they grab you by the balls and cock, and it's fine, but I didn't think it  was that dirty.  I don't remember it being that dirty.  Just describe the bumps. 
[03:00:30]  Basically, they hold you by both of your arms.  Yeah.  They bend you over oh so slightly, and they take their knee, and they ram it into your  arse for every year.  That's not how we did it.  That's not what Bonnie described.  Wow.  So they grab your arms, bend you over, and then knee you in your asshole for as many  years as you are old.  Bumps, not the humps.  Oh, the humps.  No, the bumps.  He must be from the east. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, maybe it's a different, wait a minute, Canada has an east and a west?  Sure, sure.  Does it have a left coast and, like, an east coast, and the east coast hates the west  coast?  You've seen a map of Canada, right?  Yeah, but I never saw that as an east water, either side.  I just looked at it as one big piece of shit that we don't pay attention to.  We pay attention to our brothers.  Oh, really?  Name one thing you know about Canada.  Canada?  We're forced to pay attention to it way too much.  Canada, yes.  What's their number one export?  Americans.  What's that? 
[03:01:30]  Great.  Is it our number one export to you guys?  No, number one.  What's your number one?  Oil.  Oil.  Yeah, right.  And soon probably going to be fresh water.  Oh, you dissing our water, sir?  We like our water.  Oh, yeah.  Canada has really amazing water.  Dudley Do-Right.  All right, thank you, Greg.  You know about Dudley Do-Right.  But no, the bumps was...  Grain, right?  Grain.  Great.  We have a lot of...  Textiles.  We have a lot of produce.  Textiles.  Yeah.  Now, she was talking about the bumps being, like, they hold you by the arms and... 
[03:02:00]  Like, your wrists and your ankles.  Yeah.  And then bang your ass on the ground.  I guess it's any way you can get your ass banged is the bumps.  Yeah, some way to bang some Canadian ass for their birthday.  Every year of the year.  It depends if somebody's laying underneath you, yeah.  Oh, my.  I've seen that one done, but I've never had...  Man, you guys are starved for entertainment up there, aren't you?  We just punch, like, here in America.  Let me turn you on to the American custom, Greg.  We just, like, punch the guy in the arm as many times as he is old, you know. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  Whatever.  20 punches.  We had the pink belly.  Have you ever heard of that one?  Of course.  Indian rubs, pink bellies.  Yeah, that's another one.  Yeah.  That's another one.  That's North American.  That's not just...  Yeah.  You know, the pink belly and the Indian rub and all that, that's just excuses for your  uncle to touch you.  Right.  It is.  It is.  It's a very kind of Greek Roman...  It is, eh?  For a Russian president to kiss your tummy.  Right.  Sick of creep.  Peter Graves in a cockpit moment.  All right, Greg, we're bored with you.  Yeah. 
[03:03:00]  Okay, thanks.  Thank you for standing on guard for thee, though.  That's open.  That's my bet.  I'm stealing your bet.  I gave you credit.  What are you standing on guard for thee?  I don't know.  You're there just in case we need you.  It's for us, just in case.  Just in case.  It's like fucking fifth string, though.  Who the...  Like, if we're army...  If we need...  If we're in trouble, or we need Canada, we're fucked.  The world is fucked.  The only way that Canada will ever have to go to war is because of you guys.  So, I mean...  If we lose...  We happen to be next to a superpower.  No, wait.  You're the only time you have to go to war... 
[03:03:30]  We don't get into trouble.  What you understand is that if we lose, then you gotta go to war.  But do you know how quickly you'd just be fucking decimated?  Yeah, with our army on horses.  Put the tanks away.  We're being attacked by the Renaissance Festival.  We have a...  Standing on guard for thee.  A very good Air Force, by the way, where we do a lot of training of other countries.  Yeah?  Listen, I'm gonna stick up for you like you stuck up for me, but here's the thing.  You gotta...  No, you sell me out, you cop.  Wait, wait, listen.  Standing on guard...  You know, funny?  Standing on guard...  You bombed on Sunday. 
[03:04:00]  Standing on guard for thee.  Declar.  It's like, you know, you're with your buddies, you're in a bar or whatever, and there's a huge  brawl that goes on, and it's your one friend that didn't get involved with the fight,  but he was standing on guard.  He was watching the situation.  He was watching the door.  And he thought everything was under control, but one more chair over the head, and I was  jumping in to help you guys.  Saturday Night Fever, when they run the car into the Puerto Ricans' little clubhouse bar  there.  And then the other guy... 
[03:04:30]  I didn't know where you were, Tony.  I didn't.  And you drove away.  That's standing on guard for thee.  You're kind of there, but something happened.  Canada's the dope with the platform shoes that fell off the Verrazano Bridge.  Colin.  You didn't call me, America.  You never called me.  I'm sorry.  I'll call you tomorrow.  Colin.  Get down from there, Canada.  Stop it.  I can't defend it.  I don't even feel like I'm Canadian anymore.  Colin.  All right, Opie. 
[03:05:00]  I just wanted to say that they actually did have a piece of shit rock, paper, scissors  TV show.  Yeah, they did, actually.  Jimmy Norton's older brother, Dave Attell.  And I also want, on that note, I want to say with Jimmy gone, you're really trying to  go for the pole because you've been killing today.  Nice.  I was funny today?  Yes.  Oh.  The whole buttery beat thing, although shake your body is kind of aspects.  You mean me? 
[03:05:30]  Yes, Opie.  Thank you, sir.  I appreciate it.  All right.  All right, Colin.  Colin in Florida.  Why don't we do the Lance Bass stuff?  Yeah.  Let's get sexy.  Lance Bass story from Access Hollywood.  It's the big story, so.  The day after Lance publicly declared that he's gay, the reaction is.  Notice, publicly, God damn, we knew for years.  Yeah, we knew.  And let me tell you, Ass Sex music is a bed in the background.  Not buttery beats.  That's a butt. 
[03:06:00]  Let's remember.  Butt-ry beat.  That's Ass Sex music, not buttery beats.  Small difference.  The day after Lance publicly declared that he's gay, the reaction has been overwhelming.  Actually, it's almost.  Yeah, you know what?  These motherfuckers, they love it.  They have music like we do.  They could have thrown a little Metallica riff or something just to keep the story going.  No, they're like.  Boom, boom.  They're in the production room going, all right, find the gayest music that we could throw  behind this story.  You could just smell fucking poppers and ass.  Yeah, I swear to God.  I'm thinking poppers. 
[03:06:30]  It's a gay club.  Poppers and musky.  Dark bum hole.  Everybody.  The day after Lance publicly declared that he's gay, the reaction has been overwhelming.  Actually, it's almost like his best friends couldn't wait for him to come out.  Lance's NSYNC bandmates are showing the love.  Yeah.  Justin, Lance is one of my great friends.  I wish him all the happiness in the world.  JC Chazet, he is family and I support him unconditionally. 
[03:07:00]  And Joey Fatone, I back him up 100%.  Back him up.  I get it.  Come on, Joey.  Fat one.  Guess which one doesn't have a publicist.  You are on fire.  God damn, Opie.  Thank you.  No, really, though.  The first two were, like, perfectly.  Yeah, perfectly worded.  Hey, I back him up any time.  Hey, so what? 
[03:07:30]  The guy likes Connor.  Who am I to fucking?  I'll take it in the face for him.  Well, Joey apparently was the one that knew first.  And this isn't even a joke or anything.  It was in the paper.  He had walked in on Lance and his boyfriend accidentally.  And that's how he found out that he was gay.  So that had to be an awkward moment in the NSYNC history book.  Hey, Lance, did you see the music for the holy shit? 
[03:08:00]  He's got a dick in his mouth.  Hey, but I back you up 100%.  Wait, wait, wait.  Why don't you set that up?  And then I got the audio after the door opens.  All right.  And he sees what's going on.  Like, Lance, Lance, I was looking for the...  Lance, I need the...  Oh, my God.  That's better.  That's better. 
[03:08:30]  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  I wish I knew how to quit you. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, my God.  He's a fag.  That's better.  I'm the juggernaut, bitch.  Oh, my God.  How does that get in there?  How is that so funny?  Oh, my face hurts. 
[03:09:30]  Three simple words.  I am gay.  Oh, my God.  Those men wanted to have sex with me.  Oh, my God.  Well, yeah.  All right.  Well, yeah.  Here's more audio.  I've known that Lance is gay forever.  It's no big deal.  Lance's revealing announcement to People magazine was, however, old news.  It's just a close friend and view guest, Kathy Griffin.  And he had really been hounded quite a bit.  And, you know, he's in a relationship, and he wanted to be able to go hang out with this 
[03:10:00]  person and not be running from bloggers.  Lance is here.  Longtime friend, Lance, is a frequent guest on Kathy's Emmy-nominated Bravo show, My Life  on the D-List.  He is no stranger to my game night, and also I'm no stranger to his barbecue.  So I know that it's important to Lance to not only reach out to the gay community, because  he also has many heterosexual friends.  And I know that it's important to him to, you know, keep that mix going in his life.  Yeah, right.  Why didn't he do it when NSYNC was huge with number one songs? 
[03:10:30]  The people should have known at those famous Lance Best barbecues when it's just bratwurst  sausage hot dogs on the grill.  I could see.  No buns to put them in.  You know, I have no problem when they say he's being gay, but then the whole boyfriend,  that's gay.  You know, gay, you know, that's gay.  What?  Being gay is one thing, but having a boyfriend, that's gay.  That's gay.  That's gay.  You just say you're gay without the boyfriend.  Yeah, it's okay.  Being in a committed relationship is a little faggy.  That's the reason he came out.  I mean, the reason to be gay is because you want to go give, you know, you don't want 
[03:11:00]  to just be with one guy.  That's why you're not with just one girl.  Just tremendous amounts of gay sex.  Yeah, you just want to go on the I'll Blow You World Tour.  It's not about, like, going to a show and holding hands and kissing.  Nobody wants to show passion when you're gay.  No, no.  Hey, I'm going down to the rest of the area.  Suck and dick.  Right to suck and dick.  Or whatever.  I mean, you know.  Ass sex.  Oh, my God.  Why didn't we think of this line?  Oh, that's why we got the greatest listeners in the radio.  Jeremy, what's up? 
[03:11:30]  Good morning, shit dicks.  Hey, Jeremy.  Hey, is it still considered noodling if a man puts his fish in a bass?  You know, I thought it was just catfish, but apparently you can stick your fingers in  a bass if it's still considered noodling.  I don't know.  We'll check for you.  Line of the day, Jeremy.  Funny motherfucker.  Here's Bass's boyfriend.  Opening up about his homosexuality.  Opening up.  Ending months of speculation.  Lance and Amazing Race star Riken Lemkool were an item. 
[03:12:00]  Riken told Access Hollywood today, quote, I want to keep this about Lance.  I really want to thank you for being concerned.  It's awesome to have the support.  It's awesome to have gay sex with Lance Bass.  And then finally, got to go with Leno.  Yeah.  Leno had a good set over this.  Well, an exclusive interview with People Magazine this week.  Former NSYNC member Lance Bass announced he is gay.  Of course, I was shocked.  You mean the other guys in NSYNC aren't gay? 
[03:12:30]  I thought that was gay.  What, just one?  Wow.  So I guess when they were singing Bye, Bye, Bye with all those screaming young girls,  they weren't kidding.  Bye, bye, bye.  I don't know.  No, he said he first knew he was gay when he realized his name was Lance Bass.  Lance Bass.  Well, good luck to him.  We like Lance.  Of course.  Fine, so you're gay, so what?  You get a free people cover.  Good for you.  We don't care.  That finish gets me off the hook, does it? 
[03:13:00]  Making fun of gay people.  All right.  That's fascinating, though.  Do you still have that bit?  It just has nothing to do with it.  You used to play with the Brady guy under the stairwell.  Under the stairs.  Yeah.  It's the funniest thing you'll ever hear.  It's one of my favorites.  When you were playing that and we were all laughing.  Yeah, we know, we know.  The Brady Bunch music.  We can play it.  I'm just screwing around.  Do we have that?  Oh, you've got to hear that.  Oh, Derek's yelling.  E-Rock's got to run because E-Rock knows where everything is.  E-Rock is the keeper of the opening.  Look at him.  Oh, my God. 
[03:13:30]  He just plowed over Travis.  Like he wasn't even there.  He really technically isn't.  If you weigh zero, you're really not there.  Stupid Floyd Landis.  He's going to talk about his positive drug test.  Tour de France winner.  Big story today.  We got the audio while we are in the Mike Brady thing.  He says his testosterone or whatever it is.  Are you guys doing it again?  It's elevated.  Yeah.  Fulfilling.  Wow, you are sharp.  Take it one past you, Bonnie. 
[03:14:00]  You are a sharpie, Bonnie.  Boss had no clue.  Boss is waiting to jump in again.  Boss, you even know what we're talking about.  Bonnie didn't want that rape kit to come out again.  Being raped Wednesday is enough.  I've already taken my rape shower.  I don't want to take another one.  Talk about positively stunning.  Four days after Floyd Landis' road to victory in the Tour de France,  he's been suspended by his own racing team, Phonak,  when the team said his urine sample showed way too much testosterone 
[03:14:30]  after his rousing stage 7 victory last week.  Now, suspicions for improper steroid use arise  when the ratio climbs above four parts testosterone  over one part epitestosterone.  The usual ratio for both is about 1 to 1 or 2 to 1.  Officials have not said what ratios Landis' test showed.  But at the time, Landis did submit two urine samples.  The A sample was the one in question.  Now they're going to test the B sample before making any decisions.  But a truly great story now comes to a screeching halt 
[03:15:00]  because of this controversy.  They are talking about bike riding, right?  This is a great story.  This is fucking bike riding.  Wow.  Here's audio of Floyd Landis.  All I'm asking for from me is that I'd be given a chance to prove that I'm innocent.  I didn't do anything.  No steroids.  I've been taken.  I just want to let everybody know that I don't know how this happened. 
[03:15:30]  I don't know how so much testosterone got into me.  But I tell you, but I've got to go to the doctor to have my balls lanced.  They're the size of bowling ball.  I don't know how to do it.  I don't know how to do it.  Fucking guy.  Testosterone is in his bloodstream like mayonnaise at this point.  Stop.  You did something.  Innocent. 
[03:16:00]  Cycling has a traditional way of trying people in the court of public opinion before they  ever get a chance to do anything else.  And I can't stop that.  But I would like to be assumed innocent until proven guilty since that's the way we do things  in America.  You know what?  I think it's just the French.  The French obviously hates Americans.  Yeah.  America.  And this is their sport.  They don't want Americans winning their sport. 
[03:16:30]  No.  Because when Lance Armstrong won last year, they brought all this crap up saying he cheated.  And then they figured once he was gone, a French had a win.  Right.  A Frenchman had a win.  Yeah.  They just hate us.  And this is their thing.  Just because their testosterone is down to like nothing.  This is the only sport I know they do over there.  So what are they saying?  This guy took steroids?  Yeah.  Doping.  What do you mean?  Doping.  Welcome to the story, Rich.  I really.  Rich should be checked for doping. 
[03:17:00]  No, I don't get it.  What do you mean?  What's doping?  Doping is some type of, yeah, testosterone boost that you're giving yourself.  But did he do it during the race?  Do they think?  Because they said, I was listening to a story where he went from being at the back of the  pack to all of a sudden.  Yeah, yeah.  All of a sudden, like he was testing fine, but he wasn't doing very well in the race.  And then, like at the last, what do they call it?  Stage.  Stage of the race.  Good.  Thank you.  The last stage. 
[03:17:30]  They're saying it's the most amazing finish ever.  Yeah, that he came back out of nowhere.  And that's the sample that had the increased testosterone.  You know what?  Good for him.  Because no one was going to know his name.  He was going to lose the race.  He's like, you know what?  Fuck it.  I'll do this and I'll get some headlines.  But isn't this race like a...  He's never racing again anyway because he needs to get his hip replaced.  What a way to go out.  A long race.  How long is this race?  It's like a couple weeks or a couple days?  Very, very long.  So how long is a boost?  Isn't a boost supposed to last like a couple minutes or something?  I mean, how does a boost last that long?  There's all sorts of different stages in the Tour de France.  They got like one that's a speed thing and then another thing that's a couple hundred miles. 
[03:18:00]  There's different types.  And then there's one that's ten miles uphill as you ride the bike backwards with baseball cards in the spokes.  It's the stupidest thing.  And the unicycle portion.  Unicycle while you juggle.  I try to pay attention to this sport back in the day and it's just ridiculous.  There's a million different stages.  I don't even know what they mean.  And one day they're sprinting on their bikes.  The other day it's a long, long run.  Yeah, they're just taking their time.  Also, there's like ten different separate winners or is this one winner for every...  One winner.  Yeah, let's say hi to Mike. 
[03:18:30]  But there are teams.  Mike, if the French would compete without the big basket with a baguette sticking out of the front in a parade.  Just looking at the countryside.  Let's say hi to Mike in Virginia.  Mike.  Hey, what's going on there, guys?  Hey, man.  Love your show, man.  You guys are fucking awesome, man.  Thank you, Mike.  Thanks, Mike.  Why are you guys making me a chance on Letterman?  Letterman.  We're a lot of talk about this, right? 
[03:19:00]  I think so.  I asked and they didn't write back saying no.  We already said it on the air and no one picked up on it.  Yeah, I know.  I was amazed at that.  It slipped out.  I think everyone thought we must have been joking.  No.  Because it can't possibly be true.  Another reason why this CBS deal was so great for us, yes, it got the attention of David Letterman.  Yeah.  And his people.  I guess the writers of the show are huge fans of the show.  Huge.  Yep.  And they got it done.  And, yes, we're going to be on Letterman August 31st.  Oh, cool.  August 31st, your pals Opie and Anthony on Letterman, which is like, I don't even, I 
[03:19:30]  can't even put it in perspective.  No, I don't.  I'm freaking out already.  Really nervous?  Yeah, but I talked to Luke.  Just imagine.  I talked to Luke Wilson on the phone about it.  Yeah.  And he said, down a couple of Heinekens before you go on.  Don't get drunk, because you'll look silly.  But just enough to loosen up.  Yeah, you don't want to be for our faucet.  You don't want to, yeah.  Dave, yeah.  But you want to be loose a little bit. 
[03:20:00]  I don't know how somebody that's, you know, on the wagon does it.  What do you do?  I don't.  TV makes me nervous, too.  Whenever I do TV, I get a little nervous.  Of course.  No, we need to do.  Thanks, Mike.  Drugs?  We need to stack the audience.  We need to get the O&A pass.  I feel a little more comfortable with a lot of pass than there.  Time to get your Letterman tickets for August 31st pass.  I don't know.  Yeah.  They'll get some kind of campaign going.  That's a good way to get ass-backed.  Have them in the audience.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  Dude, that's why we love the Pest. 
[03:20:30]  They know how to be civilized.  They know how to play it.  And Norton's HBO thing, they were just on fire at the special.  Here's the thing with Letterman, though.  When you guys, you're doing panels, so you can't be real.  It's not like you've got to go out and do a set.  I mean, you could screw up, you know.  But you want to make an impact.  Yeah.  You want to be funny.  You want to be entertaining.  You don't want to be boring, you know.  But you also want to appreciate the moment that you're on Letterman and not be too prepared.  No, that happens after.  No.  Anything I've ever done that I've been throw up nervous at, I have not enjoyed doing. 
[03:21:00]  I've enjoyed thinking back on it.  But it's one of those things where it's like, except for like a blowjob.  You know, let me talk about that.  The first blowjob ever.  Taste in the mouth, Joker.  You want to throw it at me?  No, I'm not going to heckle you.  It's one of those things where you're so nervous that, you know, you can't really appreciate the moment.  It just happened.  I'm going to take it all in. 
[03:21:30]  Take it all in.  I'm not going to sit there like I'm fucking chattering fool.  I've been nervous on every TV appearance we've done.  And a lot of people have seen it and said, I cannot even fucking tell you were nervous.  I fake it very well.  In a way, I hope we bomb.  When you guys didn't remember the 80s, you're killed on that.  Oh, we didn't even get to do that.  We did a clip show.  We did a rip off of the 80s clip show.  We did a clip show.  They liked us. 
[03:22:00]  They didn't even air ours.  We did Donnie Deutsch.  We did John McEnroe.  John McEnroe.  That's like doing Letterman.  Just like it.  Can I ask a very important question?  Crack heads in the audience.  Bonnie, of course.  What are you guys going to wear?  The Vox Sucks t-shirt.  See, that's like, I'll just have my girlfriend dress me.  Because I don't know anything about wearing clothes.  I don't know how to dress right without looking stupid.  I don't want to look like I'm trying to be cool with my clothes.  Because that looks stupid, too.  You've got to just kind of... 
[03:22:30]  I'm wearing this.  What the fuck am I going to do?  I'm going to wear...  You can't go too casual.  I'm going to wear...  That looks silly, too.  I'm going to wear...  You're saying a tux in there?  I'm saying a tux in there.  I'm going to wear women's clothes.  Who, who, who.  A wedding dress for you.  Boy Scout uniform.  Who, who, who.  Yeah, wedding dress.  And I'll dress as a groom.  And we'll be wacky jocks.  It's time for the Pest.  And that's another thing.  You don't want to come off like wacky DJs.  Right.  It's time for the Pest to get involved.  Yes, it's happening.  And we want, we want a showing at Letterman, August 31st. 
[03:23:00]  I think discussions about like our past, how we've gotten fired, things we've done that  have gotten us in trouble.  I think that's good.  Yeah.  If we do, if we do a few pre-interviews, it'll be a great appearance because they're just  talking about all the crazy crap we did.  Letterman, actually Letterman ends up doing monologue jokes about half the stuff we've done  in the past.  Yeah, he talked about the same past thing.  He loved the same past thing.  He went out for days.  He did like a whole week of jokes on that.  Get out, really?  Oh, every day.  So he'll obviously mention that.  Slow News Week that week.  He could talk about, he could talk about the voyeur bus where we got in the way of Clinton's 
[03:23:30]  motorcade.  He could talk about a bunch of things.  He could probably talk about the walkover, how you go from one place to the other.  Oh, wow.  Now we have a comic, Rick Boss sometimes that, yeah, so just so we can mention your name.  Always looking for a wedding.  I know.  All right, here's my biggest concern.  What?  The seating.  I don't give a crap.  Who sits where?  Oh, yeah.  Now, as a graphic or as familiarity with the show. 
[03:24:00]  Why do I have to sit closer to him?  I know what you're saying.  No, no, no, not closer.  I would have to sit in the chair next to him so that when you look at the screen, it's  Opie Anthony.  That's fine.  So I'm sitting in the chair and you're, what, on the couch?  No, they usually just.  You're on my lap.  No, it's a couch.  So I'm just next to you over there.  There isn't like the chair and the couch and then you move over?  You're sitting right next to him.  You'll be, I'll be in the, I'll be in the easy position.  I want to be like Dean Martin with a drink and a cigarette.  And he's wearing lots of makeup.  Yeah?  So be prepared for that.  Be prepared for that? 
[03:24:30]  If you want, I'll, I'll, I'll sit next to him.  I don't care.  Maybe halfway through we should have a timer and halfway through switch.  Or is that too wacky?  That's a bit wacky.  Like we couldn't decide who should sit in what seat.  You should do it one way and then the next when you come back on.  Yeah, there's going to be a next time.  I think I'd be more comfortable if Opie sat in Letterman's seat.  Oh, there you go.  That's good.  All right.  Well, give us time.  I'm getting excited.  Yeah, excited. 
[03:25:00]  I'm getting butterflies.  I want to say it again, O and A pass, take it and run with it, man.  We want a big showing at Letterman on the 31st of all.  We're going to this.  We're going to this.  All right.  Why don't we play that Mike Brady, Brady Bunch thing that Rich Voss likes?  Have we played this lately?  Is it getting old?  We haven't played in a while?  All right.  That's cool.  We'll take a break with this.  It's self-explanatory, I guess.  Right?  Does this need a setup?  Yeah, maybe.  Just hit it.  Yeah, well, for once, I didn't say the sickest thing on our show.  No?  Yes, you did.  Oh, what?  The sickest thing on the show wasn't that Sidney Simpson looked bad. 
[03:25:30]  She looked hotter four years ago.  That's pretty sick.  OJ's daughter, who disappeared.  You know, on my sicko meter, that one rang the bell.  We can't find her these days.  She got eaten by that big fat guy that follows OJ around.  Yeah.  She's gained a little weight there.  Oh, poor.  But she used to be hot.  I don't know what happened to her.  No, you could say cute and, you know, pretty.  Precious.  You don't have to express all the thoughts in your head.  You can let a few of them hit the speed bump and get derailed.  They don't have to come out.  I just thought we were having fun here.  But I thought I'd just, like, you know. 
[03:26:00]  What's the matter?  I thought I'd share with you guys.  Come back.  Where are you going?  I'm going to make s'mores.  But come on, Anthony.  You had the sickest thing today.  What was I doing?  The whole Brady Bunch bit.  What?  I just, it's true.  Mike Brady designed the Brady house.  Right.  And he didn't design any backs on the stairs leading up to the kids' room.  And there was a place where there was bushes under the stairs for someone to hide.  Mm-hmm. 
[03:26:30]  So you thought Mr. Brady was under the stairs checking out his daughters and his sons.  I knew he was.  He designed the house.  There was no cable back then.  Marsha!  Marsha, Davy Jones is here for you!  I'm good!  Marsha!  Oh!  Oh, yeah.  Come on down those stairs.  You hot bitch.  Look at you.  Yeah.  Mike!  What?  Mike!  What do you want?  Can you call Cindy down? 
[03:27:00]  Cindy?  I need Cindy.  Tiger ate the mail again.  Oh, Cindy.  Cindy, come down.  But could you wear that little Shirley Temple outfit you wore with the dress?  Don't be scared.  I'll be right under the stairs.  I'm just under the stairs.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, lisp for me.  You're the dirtiest Brady of them all.  C-cells, C-cells, bite us, C-cells.  You're a dirty girl, aren't you?  C-cells, C-cells.  Mike!  Mike!  You faghead! 
[03:27:30]  What?  Why are my panties stretched out, Mike?  Why are you asking me?  Alice's fat ass is probably in him.  That's probably it, Mike.  Oh, well, I need Jen.  Jen has to come down.  And my God, I have to reprimand her for not wearing her glasses.  She could have killed herself.  Yeah, strut down those stairs.  You little Brady.  Yeah, you're a filthy Brady girl.  Oh, stop on the stairs.  Stop right there. 
[03:28:00]  Oh!  Yeah.  Yeah, baby.  Dad, can I turn your office into a room for me?  Greg?  Yeah, Dad?  Now, Greg, we're going to have to talk about this because an office has a lot of responsibility.  I want you to come down here and I'll meet you in the office.  Okay.  Come on.  Oh, look at that Johnny Bravo ass in those pants.  Dad, can I call you Mike?  Yeah, call me whatever you want. 
[03:28:30]  Okay.  I'm going to take you to the Grand Canyon.  Really, Dad?  Yeah.  But I want to sing.  Sing into the microphone, son.  All right.  That's not a microphone.  Oh.  It's winking at me.  Dad, you're Jewish.  Bobby?  Bobby?  Yeah, Dad?  Come on down here.  We're going to play on the trampoline.  I wish I was taller.  Yeah.  I'm going to hang on the monkey bars to get taller. 
[03:29:00]  You jump up and down on that trampoline.  I'm looking right up your shorts leg.  Yeah.  Boy, that looks like a plucked chicken, doesn't it?  Yeah, not a hair on there.  Wow.  You forgot Peter.  Peter!  Peter!  Peter!  We're all out of pork chops and apple sauce.  Oh.  That's okay, Peter. 
[03:29:30]  Come on down.  All right.  Come on down and I'll feed you a sausage.  That's what you want, sausage.  Oh, walk down those stairs.  Look at you.  Oh.  You get an afro just like Dad's.  I bet you have one of those Brady Afros in your pants, too, don't you?  Yeah.  Time to change, isn't it?  Dad.  Dad.  Jan's yelling at me because he's using my hairbrush.  Shut up and get on the bunk bed.  Here comes Greg again. 
[03:30:00]  Those are groovy glasses, Greg.  You know, you were caught smoking, but no one has to know.  I won't tell Mom if you just help out old Dad.  It wasn't my jacket, Dad.  It wasn't my jacket.  I don't care.  Why are you putting the jacket over my head?  Now we're going to smoke a cigar.  Come here, Greg.  This is a fine cigar.  I call this the pink tip white owl.  You're going to like the draw on this one.  Hi, Mr. Brady.  Is Alice home? 
[03:30:30]  Hey, Sam.  To come over here and show me some meat.  All right.  As long as Alice isn't home.  Are we done?  I don't know.  My God.  I was thinking of something for Cousin Oliver, but I got thrown because Opie's got the same haircut.  Oliver!  Oliver!  Come on down.  I have to initiate you into the Brady house.  I'm going to go up to look like John Denver.  Oh, there's Greg's mouse that he's using for that little experiment. 
[03:31:00]  Let's make your butt into a habit trail.  Yeah.  Bend over, Oliver.  That's all right.  That's a paper towel tube.  It's okay.  All the Brady kids have done this.  Okay.  Very good.  That was...  Can we leave on an up note?  Oh, too late.  I doubt it.  This local tavern appears to be quite festive.  It's a friendly bunch in here.  Seems to be mustache night.  Perhaps I'll belly up to the old bar and request a libation. 
[03:31:30]  Ramon, fetch me a bikini-tini and then push in my stool.  Love is what I got.  I said, remember that.  Love is what I got.  I remember that.  Love is what I got.  For the bosses.  This song.  Yeah.  Love is...  You've got to love sublime. 
[03:32:00]  Sublime is I.  Is I.  Wow.  That sounded street.  Is I.  Get their greatest hit CD.  Too bad the dude died.  You're kidding.  He had a lot of music in him, too.  How did it happen?  Oh, no.  Jeff in Ohio.  Hey, Jeff.  What's up?  Hey, how are you?  What are you doing today?  Hey, Jeff, man.  Hey.  I just got my XM satellite radio. 
[03:32:30]  Actually, a new car was XM satellite radio about a month ago.  And I've been able to listen to you guys every single morning now.  Oh, thank you, sir.  Let me guess.  You love us.  It has changed the way you live in Ohio.  Really?  What?  Yeah, no, actually, because I live in Dayton, Ohio, so I haven't been able to listen to  you guys.  And someone told me about you guys, turned you on, and stopped listening to the, what  was it used to be the initials, B and T.  B and T?  I don't even know.  Bob and Tom.  Oh, Bob and Tom. 
[03:33:00]  They're a cute little show.  Morning radio should be all about.  All right.  What do you like about the Opie and Anthony show?  Oh, no.  Oh, even I saw that one coming.  If you're a fan, you should understand why you were just hung up on, sir.  Voicemail from Bonnie's phone.  Is this good?  Is this good?  Oh, that's, uh, I saved all the messages of it yelling at me.  You yell at her?  Why do you yell at her?  She doesn't answer her phone. 
[03:33:30]  Who?  She's too busy having sex with somebody.  So you yell at the message?  Yeah.  Because she's not answering the phone.  And this is just a small sampling.  I mean, literally, it's daily.  Because I have my phone on.  You got paranoia in your face.  No.  It's needy.  It's needy.  Yes, needy.  No, no.  That's how you got you wrong.  You're just really wrong.  I'm not clinging at all.  Can't a broad go get some cock while you're out playing golf?  What's wrong with that?  If she let me watch.  You're out there playing golf.  He bragged. 
[03:34:00]  How many times did you play golf last week?  Five out of seven days.  But here's the thing.  And you're pissed because she's not answering your phone in between holes.  No, here's the thing.  If you're going to have a cell phone, don't put it on vibrate.  What's the sense of having a cell phone?  I just made a 15-foot pot.  What's the sense of having a cell phone?  A cell phone's on you and it's on vibrate.  It's very handy.  She doesn't hear vibrate.  I put it in my purse.  She doesn't hear vibrate.  Isn't that the point?  Yeah.  Oh, I know.  Women put their phones in their purse on vibrate.  Yeah.  See, you just got kind of that.  See?  No, it is retarded.  There you go. 
[03:34:30]  Like, if it's in your pocket and on vibrate, it's fine.  This fucking jackass will call me and hang on.  Are you talking to your wife?  No, no.  I don't mean like jackass ass.  No, I mean, you know.  He sucked on Sunday, by the way.  I love it.  Don't get me wrong.  All he did was heckle.  Yeah, he did.  Why don't you stop heckling and tell some jokes once in a while?  Look, because you weren't standing guard.  Here's the thing.  For thee.  For thee.  For thee.  Here's the thing.  Yeah.  She'll call me.  Here's the deer.  Yes.  She'll call me.  Here's the deer. 
[03:35:00]  And I'll have to tell her something real quick.  She's my deer.  She'll call me, right?  Yeah.  Then hang up.  Oh, and I forgot to tell her something.  I'll call right back and she won't pick up the phone.  Can't get her.  How could you hang up and then not hear the phone?  This is an exact message, by the way.  Oh, okay.  Good.  Oh.  I don't know what your messages are.  Does he curse at you?  I just get mad.  I guess he curses.  He's just mad.  He's just mad.  You were so lucky to have her.  You know that, right?  I know.  And you're yelling at her?  I bought my own Rolex.  This is it for you.  You realize that?  What's that?  It doesn't get any better than this. 
[03:35:30]  Oh, she's funny, man.  She's a funny kid.  You know, I like being...  Yeah, that's the end of the line for you right there.  What?  It doesn't get better than that.  You lose her, you're trading down.  Way down.  Yeah.  Way down.  I love this show.  You'll be with that fucking albino grandma down in Florida.  You lose this, here comes Cougarville.  Wow.  Cougars.  Didn't I see you, darling, on the television? 
[03:36:00]  You're wonderful.  Would you like a Chesterfield?  Maybe we can hook up.  I got a room.  No, but listen, you know the deal.  It's just aggravating when they don't answer the damn phone.  It is.  Okay.  All right.  Let's say hi to Pat from Menachie.  He's reaching for his nicotine gum.  Pat.  Hey, Opie.  Hey, Pat.  How are you, buddy?  All right.  I just want to know.  Does Bonnie set a vibrator on ring?  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh. 
[03:36:30]  And then he goes, oh, oh.  Oh, oh.  I didn't think he sold that kind of a...  He does.  Pat always does.  He knows how to sell it with a...  Pat makes a hack joke very funny.  That's why we love him for the new listeners.  Pat, stay on the line for a few minutes.  If you have any comments, you just jump in there, buddy, right?  All right, here's Bonnie's voicemail from Rich Voss.  There's eight of these.  There's eight of them?  And Bonnie said she could have gave us 30.  What is it?  A day?  Two days?  This is over... 
[03:37:00]  This is over an hour.  I remember it.  I would save them to bring in over a month.  Oh, okay.  All right.  But really, it's just a small thing.  Because I forgot to save.  Lil Rich Voss being all...  Who needs this?  Oh, the button?  Whatever that does.  Sell off the machine?  How could you not answer your fucking phone in a bookstore?  You just called me.  Holy shit, that's not a bit.  That isn't him being funny.  It's personal between these two.  How could you not fucking answer your...  Oh, my God.  You're paranoid that she's getting strange cocked. 
[03:37:30]  No, no.  It always goes down to that.  So, Hedda McFarland, how does it feel to be married to this guy?  No, I'm kidding.  What, do you beat her in the body with phone books?  Never the face.  Don't hit her face.  Everyone's going to know, Rich.  Oh, here's the real Rich Voss.  Now I understand why she slit her wrist, by the way.  When the clown takes his makeup off, here's what lies underneath.  What were you doing at the bookstore, by the way?  Making him jealous.  Not buying Rich a present. 
[03:38:00]  All right, that's one.  Here's the next one.  What are the fucking odds you don't pick on your phone?  You are paranoid.  What do you think's going on?  What are the odds?  I don't think anything's going on.  You're right.  Sometimes you have to talk to people.  Oh, do I love this stuff.  What are the odds?  Now he's disgusted, Voss.  What are the odds you don't pick up the fucking phone?  Oh, wow.  Jesus.  You could barely hang on to her.  And you know that.  And you know that. 
[03:38:30]  And it's playing with your head.  And you can't smoke anymore, so you're just going batty, aren't you?  You're barely hanging on, huh?  Look it.  Jesus fucked up as I am.  You just don't know.  I can't see it.  I don't know.  Until you start collecting some messages on your phone, this is all we've got to work on.  That's right.  Exhibit A right here, man.  You better start collecting them, and you can present your case.  Third one.  Can you tell me how you could be eating lunch and not hear your fucking phone? 
[03:39:00]  Where the fuck is your phone?  Forty miles away from you?  He's even a hack when he's leaving messages.  Forty miles?  Forty miles away.  Why was this mad?  Here's the thing.  Don't try to defend your actions.  It has nothing to do with who she fucks.  Because if someone's fucking somebody, they're fucking somebody.  But sometimes you have to talk to them.  Yeah.  It's aggravating.  You know, why get a cell phone? 
[03:39:30]  Rich, when you're playing golf lots of times, I'll call you, and I'll wait an hour or whatever  for you to call me back.  I don't start calling endlessly.  What the fuck is going on here?  No, you've called a couple times in a row.  By the way, Rich has no fun to play golf with.  He has that angry.  Not anymore.  Not anymore.  I used to play with him.  It's like, boy.  He got angry.  Not anymore.  Where the fuck are you eating?  I played a lot of golf with Rich when we weren't working, and it's like, man, this was supposed 
[03:40:00]  to be a fun day, yelling and screaming.  How could you be eating lunch?  Like, how could you be eating lunch and not hear your phone?  Yeah.  Like, what does one have to do with the other?  She's supposed to lay out knife, fork, spoon, phone.  Yeah.  Look where it is now when she's around me.  It's right next to her.  She has no problem.  You know, look at...  But the other thing is I don't always answer my phone.  Like, if it's somebody I don't feel like talking to, I won't answer it.  Does it come up, Rich of all?  Well, no, I'll answer what it is, but he gets so mad if he sees me not answer my phone. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, see.  Like, he loses it.  Compassion for somebody at the other end.  Well, no, because if she's not answering her phone, that means she doesn't want to talk  or she's hiding something in front of me.  Yeah.  You know, if you don't answer your phone...  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  I didn't even think of that one.  Yeah, like, you don't answer your phone in front of...  She won't answer her phone because maybe she doesn't want to say something in front of  me, you know, when I'm there.  You know, like, not now.  I can't talk.  You know, anything.  That's like a guilt thing that I think everybody does every so often.  If you get a wrong number on the phone at home, you can't just hang up. 
[03:41:00]  You have to kind of almost have a conversation about how it's the wrong number.  How wrong number...  What was that name again?  Carlos.  No.  No.  What's your name?  Bill?  You're a gentleman named Bill calling me for Carlos that isn't here.  Because you want to get everything out.  I'm like, no.  Wrong number.  Click.  Who is that?  No clue.  Don't ask me another question about it.  Humming, humming, humming.  It's a guy that called looking for someone that doesn't even exist here in this house.  You do.  It's a guilt thing. 
[03:41:30]  I don't know why you have to do that.  All right.  Here's the fourth voicemail left by Rich Voss.  Oh, what are the odds?  You're not picking up your phone.  Vegas all the time, too, are the odds.  I know.  Or it's on Friday.  What are...  Wow.  What a guest.  That was kind of a nice one.  That was a sweet one.  Yeah.  He was in a good mood, that one.  I wasn't...  What are the odds?  You don't have to play these because they're just...  Six to one.  It's just me being pissed off.  No, we have to.  It's you being pissed, and it's funny.  And there's millions of them.  There's a pattern here.  No.  Oh, thank you, Dr. O.  Oh, there's such a pattern here. 
[03:42:00]  What?  I bury my phone when I don't want to talk to anybody.  No.  No.  Oh, it's very hard, man.  I'm with Bonnie.  When I know someone wants to talk to me, I bury that motherfucker.  Yeah, see, here's the ding.  I throw it on vibrate and throw it in my sock.  I know, but it's embarrassing when I'm with my friends, and then I'll take my phone and  my person will be like, five missing calls, and I'll call them back, and they hear him  yelling at me.  What?  And I've got to be like, oh, I'm just with my friends. 
[03:42:30]  It's like, they're like, who did you marry?  No, don't exaggerate and try to make me look like fucking Jake Lomano or somebody, right?  No cell phones back then?  Hands are big enough to box with me.  Hold on.  Let's say hi to Tony in Philly.  Tony?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  They missed the best line ever.  Oh, no.  Bonnie wasn't buying a gift for Voss at the bookstore.  Oh.  It was fucking hilarious.  Thank you for catching that, sir.  People are listening. 
[03:43:00]  Let's play the fifth voicemail left by Rich Voss to buy it.  I think one of these is not that good.  Uh-oh.  Me.  That one.  Me.  Me.  That's it?  Me.  Maybe I was just beaten down at that point.  Yeah, you're done.  I'm just done with that.  You're just, at this point, you're just picturing Black Cog.  Oh, Jesus.  Me.  How come she's not defending saying, no, I would never do that?  Oh, wow.  Well, that means you're guilty.  Because Dr. Phil says don't indulge you.  That's right.  And we're really good at reading eyes, so she just wants to just stay neutral right now. 
[03:43:30]  Dr. Phil.  Fucking Dr. Phil probably picks up his phone.  Here's number six.  A couple more left.  Are you for real?  How can you not be picking up your phone when you know I'm coming to pick you up?  And I'm seriously pissed off again.  This is fucking ridiculous.  Holy shit.  No, listen.  Oh, man.  You are an ogre.  You are a sad clown.  Listen, let me tell you something.  It just is. 
[03:44:00]  Listen, I'm picking her up at the fucking airport.  Yeah.  At the airport, I'm pulling in.  She doesn't have her phone, so I can go, hey, I'm pulling up now.  How do you not have your phone when you're being picked up?  An airport pickup, Bonnie.  I got to go with him on this one.  On this one, if that is the airport one.  Yes, it is the airport one.  If that is, your honor, but there is no proof.  She had a few minutes to kill.  She said, ah, what the hell?  I'll hang out with the pilot in the cockpit.  That's all the crazy shit you're thinking.  I'm not stupid, boss. 
[03:44:30]  Is that really what it is?  Absolutely.  That's so dumb.  No, it's...  Who doesn't have their phone on?  I went to the bathroom.  I called him immediately afterwards.  Yeah.  Because there's nowhere to park.  In the background, you're like, when can I see you again?  Pilot speaking.  Who was that?  Because we all have the paranoia in our heads. 
[03:45:00]  All right, here's number seven.  You know what?  I'm ready to go eat without you.  It's unbelievable.  You don't have your fucking phone on.  It's unbelievable.  You don't have your phone.  Like the Loch Ness Monster.  Like Bigfoot.  It's unbelievable.  You don't have your phone on.  Use the word unbelievable.  And that's the point you're thinking in your head.  I knew it was too good to be true.  I knew it. 
[03:45:30]  I knew it.  It's...  It's...  I'm telling you, if I could fucking put an ankle bracelet on her or something.  Oh, yeah.  Of course you would.  What does the dance, Rich?  We're together like 24-7.  I mean, we're all...  Yeah, man.  She needs some time.  I wouldn't even have time to have an affair.  She's going to have a radio collar and a tag in her ear after Voss darts her.  I would prefer it to the messages.  Yeah.  First of all, you're trying to make me look like some crazy...  Trying to look...  I didn't leave those messages.  Right.  Yeah, but you saved them.  Here's the thing. 
[03:46:00]  Like some...  Thank God.  What's the way to...  Show you for the creep you are.  This is unbelievable.  But I absolutely erased, like, so many of them because I forget that I was going to...  I can believe a UFO coming down and giving me an ass probing, but you not having your phone  on, unbelievable.  Here's the final one for today.  She did say that there's many, many more.  Ooh.  What's that?  Hope you're getting a message.  Uh, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a wrong text, uh, coming in. 
[03:46:30]  Oh, I've got a guy named Bill from, uh, Bill?  I don't know any Bills.  I get texted from my phone company sometimes.  They text it like, deal and stuff.  And you'll, you'll hear that.  But there's a text message thing.  And I'll open it up and read and go, God damn, uh, AT&T.  Again, with their junk mail.  Is there a way, baby, baby, do you know of a way to keep them from texting me?  He does that all.  Because it's just a thing.  You want to, you want it known that, you know, you're not getting these texts that are, you 
[03:47:00]  know, from anybody.  This is sneaky.  A text message from Sally from AT&T.  Uh-oh.  Well, yeah, you gotta always use a guy's name, right?  Stop writing me.  It's always, yeah.  You're a guy, he's a guy's name.  Bill, Bob, something.  All right, here we are.  Guy's name.  Here's the last, uh, voicemail that Rich left for Bonnie.  You know what?  I'm gonna take your phone away.  That's what I'm gonna do.  Yeah.  I'm gonna take it away.  That's probably.  See, and he's doing that in front of friends. 
[03:47:30]  Clearly, he had a friend with you.  That was in your, uh, oh no, no, you didn't pick up, so I couldn't know your back.  I got one more, um, Rich Voss, uh, message.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  God damn, Rich cunt.  I kill Rich cunt.  Jesus, Rich.  Come on, Mal.  You're threatening to take her phone away?  The girl is just...  She's an adult.  She, she, you know what she does?  She abuses her privileges.  That's the problem.  You actually think you could take her cell phone away?  And have a, and, and your relationship would continue? 
[03:48:00]  You having her is a privilege.  Shut up.  Yeah, no shit.  Listen, here's the thing.  Maybe if she, if she didn't have it for a day, she would see, you know, how useful it could  be with, uh, with the ringer on.  Or maybe you could just punch her in the face and she'll get the same message.  No, I'm not a violent person.  Here's the thing, too.  Here's the thing, too.  She could be getting a call from somebody.  She won't answer it.  Okay.  Two reasons.  Okay.  That she should answer it.  One, it could be for her career.  It could be like that call. 
[03:48:30]  Right.  She goes, she goes, no, she says.  Those calls, they'll call back.  That's what she says.  Absolutely.  They'll leave a message.  They'll leave a message.  No, but how about they don't, how about they find someone else in between you and the  Oh, while it's ringing, they, oh, someone else.  No, see, in show business, you've got to jump on things.  You're thinking about yourself, not her.  You just want her to pick up the phone every time you call so you know exactly what she's  up to.  No, not only.  It could be a call for your career.  No, even when I'm with her.  You're paranoid.  A little bit.  I'm not going to lie.  Sometimes you get a little paranoid. 
[03:49:00]  I don't know you're out of your league, but she loves you.  Can I ask Bonnie a question?  Why don't you have your ringer on?  Because I don't have a good ringer, and it's, I think it's embarrassing.  Well, well, well, it is.  I see the worst.  Point rich.  Oh.  Point rich.  That's a lame-ass excuse.  Daddy hate you.  Daddy just hit me right in the gun.  Daddy, when that answer came on.  Now I understand your paranoia.  I don't have a good ringer.  I have a lame ringer.  I'm going to fuck.  It's not like, hold on.  It's not like cell phones were just invented. 
[03:49:30]  There's probably 10 million ringtones you should get.  I know, but I don't have.  Holy Jesus.  I don't have a good ringer?  Rich, there could be a problem now.  There could be a problem.  You have every right to be paranoid.  I think you're right.  Don't you hate when you're out and people's phones go off?  I hate it.  I think it's rude.  I don't have a good ringer.  I don't have a good ringer.  Oh, boy.  Why don't you put.  I was with you.  Man, you just lost some major points.  Why don't you put you having a groaning orgasm with whoever you're with as your ringtone. 
[03:50:00]  You don't have a good ringer.  That just.  When you said that.  Yeah, that hurt.  You felt it, right?  It was like walking in on somebody.  Yeah.  It was like walking in on another couple.  That was a bad one.  I felt that.  That was a bad excuse.  I felt that one, Rich.  It's the same ringer as everybody else's ringer that has sprints.  You might as well have just said he's just a friend.  Like that's the same.  Why don't you answer the phone?  Wow.  Because my boyfriend hates to be interrupted.  When he's fucking me.  Wow.  That's. 
[03:50:30]  That's.  Oh, boy.  You know what?  I'm not away from you long enough to be fucking anyone else.  Well, you have neighbors.  Anybody can just pop in.  Pop in.  Literally.  He tries.  He tries to.  Now.  Now it's all coming out.  You want it all to come out, Rich?  What?  I'll say it.  Say what?  I'm crazy.  Oh, yeah.  You think I'm fucking all the neighbors.  You really think she's fucking the neighbors?  He'll go.  Somebody will be walking.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  To their.  To their.  To their car.  And he'll be like.  What's that guy's name again?  Oh, he's trying to call her out.  Trying to call her out.  Fucking Columbo. 
[03:51:00]  Look at him.  What was that name again?  Oh, that's Bobby.  How do you know?  I gotcha.  Yeah.  Or he'll be like.  What?  What?  What?  Is that guy's kitchen color again?  Oh.  It's annoying.  It's a nightmare.  No, less than a while.  We're getting into it.  That's funny.  Every neighbor.  Once in a while.  You know, you just get a little insecure.  Everybody does, right?  A little bit every now and then.  You know.  You know what the best thing a neighbor could do as a joke?  When you see the husband and wife pulling out. 
[03:51:30]  Wave.  If you don't know, like you don't know them from a fucking hole in the wall, just wave like,  hey, how you doing?  And start a fucking argument that you won't even see.  World War III in the car.  That's it.  All the way to Bennegan's.  I think we have a new game.  Or just do the universal thing where you hold up your thumb and pinky and mouth, call me.  Oh, Jesus.  It's like, call me.  Oh, man.  And then just imagine the hijinks that are going on in that car. 
[03:52:00]  She comes home limping with a black eye.  God forbid somebody to do that to me, though.  Oh, see?  Because he would.  There's no convincing him.  The neighbor said something to Rich about our kitchen one day.  And he.  How would he know our kitchen color or the tiles in our kitchen?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  I don't know if I ever invited him in.  Did he say something that made you think he knew?  Well, he was in there.  He goes, yeah.  You know, my place is different than yours because you put the black tiles in.  Now, how did he know? 
[03:52:30]  I don't know.  How did he know?  I don't know.  Holy shit.  I don't even talk to the neighbor.  Do you have a big window looking into the kitchen?  No.  No, you can't see.  There's no window looking into the kitchen.  Holy shit.  Rich is a bad CSI because he probably invited the guy in at some point and forgot.  Rich got jealous of his own cigarette one time.  He came to L.A. and his cigarette from the last time he was there was sitting in the  ashtray and he was like, her cigarette is this?  It didn't look like my cigarette butt.  It was darker than my cigarette butt. 
[03:53:00]  It was your brand.  It was your cigarette butt.  No, it wasn't my brand.  He's still jealous of it to this day.  He's jealous of himself.  And these are real CSI.  These are real CSI.  Bonnie, it ain't looking good.  CSI.  Wouldn't you question any of this?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay, now, see, now the tiles are turning.  The tile thing is a little weird.  Yeah, the tile.  How does he know the tile?  Oh, there's guilt on her face.  No, there's not.  Oh, shit.  There is guilt on her face, right?  No, there's not.  At least it's just guilt.  I wiped the other stuff off. 
[03:53:30]  But listen.  I got a good private investigator that just texted me.  What do you say?  Rich needs a good private investigator.  Yeah, put a private investigator on me.  Well, if you know.  I should just clear it up once and for all.  Then you'll be fucking the private eye.  Make sure he's cute.  Side 31.  CSI.  Cunt scene investigation.  No, but there really is nothing going on.  Well, B.C., you know, here's the thing, too.  Look, the first girl in my life. 
[03:54:00]  I see some tile here.  Do you recognize this color?  You're the neighbor.  Who let you in?  Was it Rich or Bonnie Voss?  Why don't you just ask him?  Yeah, ask him.  When were you in my house?  Yeah, ask him.  Are you afraid he's going to go,  the time you invited me in, dummy?  At one time, the guy said to Rich,  oh, are you doing a show or whatever?  Rich said, yeah.  And he goes, is Bonnie doing it?  And then Rich lost his mind.  No, no, no.  The guy said, the guy said, where are you working?  And he goes, is Bonnie going to be with you? 
[03:54:30]  All right, that's a good question to, like,  see if you're not going to be there.  Yeah, right?  Right.  And where's Bonnie going to be?  Well, why are you doing this?  Because you're starting it.  No, he's right.  You don't know.  His brain is screwed up.  And he takes this and twists it until he keeps it.  No, we as Ben kind of do.  You know, there is not an inkling.  Play those messages again.  You could have not an inkling that your girl's cheating on you.  Believe me.  Not an inkling.  But, like, something will, you just want to, like, test it out. 
[03:55:00]  Just to make sure.  Well, he tests it.  You want to do that.  Well, I'm going to have an anxiety attack.  Because now everything's going through my head again.  Oh, no.  All right?  Why would he ask, so, where are you working?  Oh, yeah, I'm in.  Oh.  Well, there's ways that people, my doctor, our doctor knew who I was.  What's that?  Our doctor?  I mean, I'd never met him before.  He knew my name.  Did he touch your pussy?  Yes.  Okay.  I'm an oncologist, you idiot.  Okay.  Here's the thing.  Why would, just a guy go, so is Bonnie going to be? 
[03:55:30]  Wouldn't you question that?  I might question, yeah, why he would be curious.  The same guy that knows your tile?  Yeah, knows the tile pattern.  That is a little, the tile thing's got me.  He's Asian.  Unless.  Okay, I'm not going to fool around with an Asian guy.  She's going to.  Why?  Asian people are good looking.  Right to the black guy.  Bonnie's a size queen.  She's not going to.  That's true.  She's going to hurt you.  She's going to do it with a black guy.  That's right.  No, because she's going to make sure her hurt you.  Anymore.  In more ways than one.  We're going to take her own pain just to give you a little more. 
[03:56:00]  Let's say hi to Sean in New Hampshire.  Sean.  Yeah.  Boss, I just wanted to say your sheets are very comfortable, man.  Oh.  Now I can see what's going to happen.  It's so.  Hey, I love the high thread count.  Oh.  Oh.  Well, Dan, if you're coming from New Hampshire to get laid, you're really fucking hurting.  No, I'm good.  But.  Out of state, right?  Hey, let's say hi to Jeff in Pennsylvania.  Jeff.  Hey, it's a.  I understand completely about the tile thing because I had a neighbor. 
[03:56:30]  I was redoing my house.  My, you know, right when my fiance moved in with me.  And the one.  Listen, I really like what you're doing with that room in there.  What the hell is that shit about?  Yeah.  See?  See?  I mean.  Yeah.  He looked at me and was like, I like what you did.  You put an arch in there and you told me the color of the paint and everything.  And one morning.  Clearly your wife is fucking around.  About two in the morning.  The sun was in my windows.  He was what?  So you might want to believe, Donnie, because there are a lot of fucked up freaks out there. 
[03:57:00]  You can't see.  There's no way.  Donnie's not screwing around on you, Rich.  I'm absolutely not.  And not only that, but I've never given you one, like, I've never done anything wrong  the entire time we've been together.  Well, eight times you didn't answer your phone right here.  No.  Here's the thing.  You're going to be damaged.  Like, okay, let's say this.  Say the first girl you ever lived with.  The first girl you ever fell in love with.  Oh, this boo-hoo story again?  Whatever.  Boo-hoo.  Guys, listen.  Girls are sneaky. 
[03:57:30]  Don't you think girls are kind of fucked up?  Well, girls would say guys are sneaky.  You're not saying anything that's going to blow people away.  It's the battle of the genders.  Yeah, man.  Each side thinks the other side is sneaky.  That way you already know.  We could throw that on the table.  Yeah.  You think girls are more sneaky than guys?  Yes.  You don't think so?  I think it's probably equal.  I don't know.  Like, look it.  Before I met Bonnie, I was a player.  I don't even fucking talk to these broads now. 
[03:58:00]  I'm a good-looking guy.  You know, I'm a catch.  She fucking did well here.  When he's playing those fucking recordings,  he's looking at my face like I'm really sick,  but he's looking at me going,  I understand because I have my own sicknesses.  You smoke crack, don't you?  You smoke crack, don't you?  I don't have the sicknesses you have.  Everybody, you know, I'm not, you know, whatever. 
[03:58:30]  But Anthony knows.  He could tell.  I just know, like...  When she said, I don't like the ring,  that hit me in the gut like, oh, why don't you just say...  It's a true statement.  I love feeding into this is what I love doing.  I like it.  Because you don't know that it's like,  it's hours of me talking it.  No, the ring on her phone.  Why don't you ask your phone?  And she goes, I don't like the ring.  I don't...  I think it's rude when people's phones are ringing all the time.  Then, if you have it on Viber.  She's from Canada.  Yeah, we're quiet people. 
[03:59:00]  They think differently in Canada.  Let me tell you who's probably got the most reason to be paranoid.  Radio jocks.  Because all a girl has to do is turn on the fucking radio,  and she knows where you are at any given moment.  Right.  Okay, now Rich is never going to come in and do radio without me.  So what are you saying?  Yeah, without her being here.  I'm saying relax.  She's with you.  It's okay.  Don't be so paranoid.  Whatever.  I'm not that...  Yeah, whatever.  You know, it's a funny little bit.  You know, hey, I laugh.  We all laugh. 
[03:59:30]  He's talking freaking out.  Rich is losing his mind, man.  He's losing his mind.  There's all sorts of stuff going on in that head now.  Holy shit.  Yeah, we'll see how much fun it really was since these mics go off.  I don't like the fucking ring.  That's going to stick with us.  Why don't you answer your phone?  I don't like the shape of the phone.  Helps my ear.  He's going to find so many ring phones for you.  And also, that's why I don't like talking on the phone too long.  It gets hot.  Yeah.  It's all right.  Never mind.  Let's go to Stacy in New York.  Stacy?  Stacy, yes.  This is Stacy.  Hey, Stacy.  Ross, you fucking son of a bitch. 
[04:00:00]  You paranoid son of a motherfucker.  Listen, okay?  You're so fucking paranoid.  You once accused me of fucking my own brother, you fuck.  It doesn't have a bit guy.  Who is that?  Stacy.  Yes?  You're Voss's ex?  I never went out with a girl.  I went out with a girl, Stacy, in 1980.  Listen, he once accused me of fucking my own brother, okay?  Wait, first of all, you sound...  I think she does know me.  No, she sounds like a guy.  Are you Latin?  Because I would have went out with you. 
[04:00:30]  I would have banged you, but I would have never went out with you.  I am Puerto Rican.  Oh, yeah.  Well, maybe you did bang your own brother.  You guys do multiply.  Oh, Richard.  That was a little too much.  Yeah, that was a little too much.  On me?  On my behalf?  Yes.  It's, you know...  This guy's got a reason you might know the tiles.  Tiles, Patrick?  Yeah?  You have a reason that...  Yes, the reason I might know the tiles is...  How long has Voss lived in the house?  A couple years.  So maybe it's...  All right.  Was the neighbor there when you lived in the house? 
[04:01:00]  Was the neighbor there before you lived in the house?  Good line of questioning.  No, and we put the new tiles in.  Oh, you put new tiles in.  Now, was there...  Okay, okay.  Was there any scrap tile out by the garbage?  Well, I think the guy...  Well, here's the thing.  I think the only thing I could think of...  But I don't think the guy was cutting the wood and doing some of the stuff outside.  Cutting the tiles out.  But I don't think the guy...  In between having sex with Bonnie, he was putting...  No.  Oh, no.  That was the tile guy, which I was also having sex with Bonnie.  Oh, my God. 
[04:01:30]  Oh, jeez.  By the way, this is a...  That's not grout between those tiles.  Oh, God.  She got to work her ass off.  Johnny...  Enjoy your tile.  Johnny...  Johnny on Long Island.  Hey, what's going on?  Ross, I just want to tell you.  It might be you.  The most paranoid people in the world are usually the cheaters.  Oh, the cheaters?  Yeah, you know what?  That's a true story.  I say that all the time.  Point Bonnie.  Point Bonnie.  Yes.  You're welcome, bro.  Yeah, thank you. 
[04:02:00]  No, but he's absolutely right.  What?  No, that's a known fact, because you see it on all the talk shows and stuff.  Yeah, that's where you got that from.  Yeah.  The ladies' magazines...  Now you're...  Hey, you guys have fun at Caroline's this weekend.  Wow.  Listen, you son of a bitch.  It's the I'm not letting her out of my sight tour.  I know.  When he's on stage, sometimes I'll leave the room and he'll be like, Bonnie?  Oh, Jesus.  The crowd's just all dismayed. 
[04:02:30]  What's going on in your head?  Why is he yelling this woman's name?  What's going on in your head?  While you're on stage, you're thinking she's blowing the bartender real quickly.  You'll know who I'm talking to the entire time.  First of all, two things.  I see what's going on in the room everywhere.  I see what's going on.  As soon as you don't see her, you're thinking some crazy stuff, right?  Because some guy came up and she goes, you're really funny, and she feeds into that.  Someone says, you're...  So, what the...  How does that play on your head?  She feeds into that to the point she drops to her knees?  Yes.  Here's the thing.  Holy shit.  She appreciates a compliment. 
[04:03:00]  Listen, just like, I tell her, look, if you want to bang a guy in front of me, that's different.  Okay?  Oh, God.  His psyche has got crossed wires.  It's crazy.  Oh, wow.  Rich, I apologize in advance for this next phone call, but it has to be on the air, okay?  Is he going to...  All right.  I...  Why?  Oh.  This is Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie on the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, Opie stepping out of character. 
[04:03:30]  This guy.  Now, Greg Hughes.  This guy might go a little too far, but as Opie on the Opie and Anthony show, I love it.  And here's Kyle in Michigan.  Kyle.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, doesn't Rich have a daughter the neighbor could be fucking?  Oh, you know.  No, she has a boyfriend.  See, at least you know it's not Bonnie, but it might be your daughter that's with the neighbor,  and that's why he knows what the title's like.  No, my daughter doesn't live with me.  She visits. 
[04:04:00]  But I'm there.  She's not bringing in...  There the whole time?  Oh, I thought this was going to be a worse call.  Nah, nah.  Oh, Jesus.  That's pretty harsh, man.  All right.  Oh, I'm getting chest pains.  I'm getting anxiety now.  Aw.  Relax.  You're okay.  All right.  Why don't we wrap up the proceedings?  Rich, I love you.  I love you, too.  Thank you.  I love you, too.  I've never seen you guys kiss.  Can you kiss us, Rich?  I'm going to see how they kiss.  How we kiss? 
[04:04:30]  Yeah.  We've never seen any affection between you two.  It's just a little kiss.  Come on.  You're on pal talk and everything.  Let's see a little kiss before we leave.  Come on, baby.  Yeah, come on.  Wait, sit down, because your head's...  As passionate or unpassionate as you want to make it.  Right.  You sit.  You sit.  All right.  I want to see...  I want to see what...  Yeah, a peck on the cheek is there.  Wow.  Wow.  I've never...  Oh, my God.  Hey, Rich, where'd she learn this?  Aw.  Wow.  Ooh.  Ooh. 
[04:05:00]  That's cute.  Keep it going.  Keep it going.  Keep it going.  Hey.  Rich is grabbing for some pit.  You are on pizza.  You're such an ass.  Rich just wants to fuck it right here now.  Come on.  Pal talk.  I'm going to go on Pal talk in front of everybody.  You will?  Yeah.  Yeah, I would love to do that.  We?  Or you?  No, I'd love to...  Not you.  No, not...  I'm talking like you would love it, or we meaning you.  I would love to...  I...  We had a hotel room in New York up on like the 20th floor.  Excuse me?  Remember we had the hotel... 
[04:05:30]  Oh, I can't tell that story?  Oh.  No.  It's not a big deal.  Well, now we know the story.  I don't know.  The window.  The window.  I think we can figure it out.  The Bonnie was looking at you like, hello?  He's just going to...  How about we save something for ourselves?  It's so dirty.  You've got to wash your hands.  Yeah.  Obi's Purelling from the filth he just thought of.  I'm getting ready.  I feel like I'm in shot now.  Oh, shit.  No, I'm sore. 
[04:06:00]  Jesus.  You two are a wreck.  Oh, thanks.  Can you believe Comedy Central did not pick up our fucking TV show?  It's unbelievable.  Yeah, that would have been a good one.  See?  Talk like that.  The paranoia.  You know, today was the...  Following Bonnie around with a camera.  I know.  So Richard would be like, have the crew go out with Bonnie again all day today.  I want to look at the footage tonight.  Yeah.  Just like, yeah, looking through it.  No, no, I want to be involved in the editing process.  I'm going to look at every piece.  I think I was fucking the cameraman. 
[04:06:30]  Or the producer.  Why is the time code different here?  Why is it edited already?  Why is it edited already?  Something was edited for three seconds.  What did you do?  Let's say hi to Wayne in New York.  Hey, Wayne.  This should help out, Rich, because we want Rich to go away from this show today, you know,  a little relaxed and not paranoid.  Right.  All right.  Go ahead, Wayne.  Hey, Voss.  If Bonnie didn't like your ring, wouldn't that make her answer the phone faster?  Yeah.  Budget it out, guys. 
[04:07:00]  All right.  I'm really having an anxiety attack lately.  All right.  I'll put it on the ring.  Go ahead.  No, forget it now.  I don't know.  Oh, here's a good one.  33 across.  33 across.  Hey, boys.  Hey, Voss.  Have a good set at the art center for the ONA virus, since Bonnie's not going to be with  you.  See you on a 26, Bonnie.  See?  It's going to get nasty now.  You better come to grips with it, because people are going to email you the color of my  underwear.  Oh, we would love to get Bonnie on the tour. 
[04:07:30]  We've got to figure that out somehow.  She would kill on it.  Yeah.  We would like to see her on the tour.  Yeah.  We would love to see me on the tour.  Well, she's going to be backstage with the camera.  She's doing something there.  Yeah.  Of course she is.  Of course she is.  She's going to be your personal assistant.  Yes.  She's going to be baking cookies if it was up to you.  No.  Listen.  I trust her.  I love her.  I trust her.  But sometimes you get paranoid as a dude, you know?  Well, paranoia.  You know, we're fucking in.  Not cool, dude.  Not cool.  No, no.  Not cool. 
[04:08:00]  Just a ruse.  Yeah.  It's just a ruse.  Yeah, let's end with that.  We'll end with this.  We really, we weren't supposed to go late today.  We've got a huge meeting.  We've got meetings and stuff.  We've got to talk about our, we're filming a TV commercial tomorrow.  That's cool.  National or local?  It's going to start in New York and it might go everywhere.  We'll see.  We'll see what happens.  Yeah, it'll be on CBS stations.  Oh, then it'll be national.  It's exciting to see your billboards and everything all the time.  I know.  Isn't that fun?  I love Eric Logan.  We all know that.  Yeah.  And we like what he does for us here at XM, but it's kind of cute because he called the 
[04:08:30]  other day like, hey, you guys are part of the latest XM TV commercial.  I've seen that a lot.  Yeah, we saw it the other night.  And it's a still shot of us that goes by like, that's cute, Eric.  Yeah, but it's on there.  We'll be filming all day tomorrow for our own 30 second TV commercial.  That's cool.  And I like.  We had to pick out Fat Broads the other day.  Really?  Yeah.  We had to cast a commercial.  And the funny thing is what we forgot to mention.  They had some like 30 girls come to the audition. 
[04:09:00]  Most of them left when they found out who the commercial was for.  Really?  No.  I swear to God.  They were like, for those guys, no way.  So you threw a wig on Bobby Kelly?  I think we got a good one for the commercial.  So it should be fun.  And I think it's going to be airing as soon as they're done.  I mean, the turnaround is going to be pretty quick on that.  So we're excited.  And I liked what Hugh Pinero said about us in his little address.  Yeah, write this date down. 
[04:09:30]  What day is it?  Friday, July 28, 2006.  Thanks, Hugh Pinero, the CEO of XM Satellite Radio, acknowledged that we work for the company.  Yes.  That didn't take long.  Thank you, Hugh Pinero.  Now, what did he say, though?  He said a lot of people were coming.  Oh, here it is.  That's the quote from XM CEO Hugh Pinero.  In the last 90 days, customers citing Opie and Anthony as a reason for subscribing have doubled.  Yeah.  But it's probably okay with CBS's radio's Joel Hollander, who's happy with O&A's first spring numbers. 
[04:10:00]  I saw a quote yesterday that was most people, most new subscribers signing up cited us as the reason that they subscribe.  That's really cool.  To XM.  That's great.  Oh, we just rule.  You know what?  Why don't we kiss Bonnie's ass as well here so everyone feels good about themselves before we leave.  Billy in Colorado.  Don't worry.  He's in Colorado, Rich.  Oh, hey.  I'm from Rich.  Just a short flight, though, Rich.  Yes, Billy.  Hey, Bonnie.  Yeah.  Hey, I just want to say how funny I think you are. 
[04:10:30]  Did you call me tonight?  Yeah.  Like always.  Well, you had to add to it, but a lot of people calling in saying Bonnie is very funny as well.  Oh, thanks.  All right.  We're going to end with...  Staney's from Colorado.  Meanwhile, you hear a tractor trailer horn outside and over his phone at the same time.  What the...  What's outside?  Are you guys going to be okay?  Yeah, we'll be fine.  Yeah, you're fine.  We get along great now.  We do get along very well.  All right.  Caroline's this weekend with Rich Voss and Bonnie McFarlane.  Turn your ringer off and find out what the tile thing...  Oh, turn your ringer on and find out what the tile thing is all about. 
[04:11:00]  All right.  That'll solve everything.  No, it would really suck if this guy's listening to the show.  He's going, why am I being accused of all this?  Yeah, what did I do?  I know.  What if he is?  How embarrassing.  If he's going to fucking accuse me, let me tell you what I'm going to do.  Oh, God.  If I'm going to catch the blame for it.  Oh, you know what?  He used to live with a girl, right?  Oh.  And she's on MySpace, and every now and then she'll mail me, go, how's it going, this and  that.  Hey.  Well, wait a second.  On MySpace, you know how you're doing.  Unbelievable.  I haven't...  Unbelievable.  I'm waiting for the email.  Oh, and you know why I left him? 
[04:11:30]  I'm waiting for that email.  Oh, so you know...  Oh, you learn a little bit about your neighbor?  Because he was fucking my neighbor.  I'm going to call.  That's probably why.  Who's calling you?  Hello?  Oh.  Oh, it just cut off.  Oh, sure it did.  Holy shit.  You're acting stick.  You're acting stick.  You're acting stick.  No, it did.  It just cut off.  Fight fire with fire.  Yeah, wow.  That was believable.  Hi, Rich.  Oh, it just cut off. 
[04:12:00]  Hi, sweet.  Oh, are you?  That's a great way to end.  Oh, look.  It's ringing.  Yeah, it's ringing.  Is she there?  I've cut off again.  All right, here's Rich again.  This phone sucks.  That sounds vibrate.  That's why I can't eat.  All right.  You guys, thank you so much.  Listen, thank you.  Anything we can do to destroy your marriage, we'd be happy to.  You're welcome back anytime.  Speaking of marriages, if anybody wants to be in a comedy central pilot in September,  email rich at richfoss.com.  Yeah, that's why you wanted to email, yeah. 
[04:12:30]  No, a couple that's getting married.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Yeah, no, no.  Real things and pictures of huge cops.  That's right.  To that email address, because he'd want to see that.  Because it's still ringing.  It's Greg Charles.  Ah.  Yeah, Greg.  We're at Opie and Anthony.  He's right outside the door, you ass.  Oh.  Oh.  I think Greg Charles takes care of us at Caroline's.  Great comedy club. 
[04:13:00]  Love Greg.  These guys are there all weekend long.  All right.  All right, man.  We're going to leave with the Jody Applegate.  The video's up on opiananthony.com.  We had a lot of fun with this.  It seems like yesterday at this point.  I know.  Very funny.  Here's the setup really fast, but people are requesting this.  In the video, you can check it out for yourself, opiananthony.com.  Casey and Van appear on Good Day New York to demonstrate how easy it is to steal a bicycle.  They pull a gag, and Jody Applegate doesn't think it's funny.  They make believe that one of the guys got slashed across the neck live on TV.  With the grinder.  That's right.  All right, so check out this audio as we leave you. 
[04:13:30]  Leave you now.  Have a great weekend.  We'll see you guys on Monday.  Mm-hmm.  Bye.  All right.  Show us how unfortunately easy it is to do what you're going to do.  Tell us what that is.  All right.  So I have an angle grinder.  It's designed to cut metal, and you plug this into the bottom of a light post.  Get on there.  Yeah.  Turn.  Turn it on.  Yeah.  What Van's doing now is he's just cutting right through the, uh, Van's cutting right 
[04:14:00]  through the, um, the chain here, and if you look closely, you can see how it goes right  through, and, uh, you have to be very careful of these, oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Cut it out.  Cut it out.  Stop that.  No, I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  I'm fine.  Just stop.  I was just kidding.  No.  No.  It's okay.  We're trying to do a serious thing here, and this is not funny. 
[04:14:30]  Do not be that's catch up.  Do not be upset.  There are children watching.  That was not funny.  That's totally uncool.  Oh, we were just doing a ruse.  And this is not planned.  Not planned by me.  We were just doing a ruse.  And I don't appreciate that on our show and our air.  Do not be upset.  That was a ruse, and we did not agree to that.  We'll be right back after this.  That was not cool, too.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What are you, crazy?  Hold on.  You mother effers eat a trap.  Somebody stop it. 
[04:15:00]  Stop it.  Damn you.  Shut up, you bitch.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, suck it.  Come here.  Oh, daddy.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, suck, suck, suck it.  I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too.  Somebody stop it.  Fuck, fuck, fuck.  Shoot the hell up.  Fuck, fuck, fuck. 
[04:15:30]  Pander.  Fuck, fuck, fuck.  Fuck me, then.  God, fuck, fuck.  God damn it.  It's hard to catch.  I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too.  Thank you. </pre>
