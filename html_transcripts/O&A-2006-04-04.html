<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts returning from vacation, excitedly noting improved studio lighting and a new intro, though immediately encountering microphone issues.  They then launched into a discussion of their eight-year tradition of being off the air on April Fool's Day, contrasting their honesty with what they perceived as the dishonesty of Howard Stern and Artie Lange ("Dice"), vehemently denying Lange's claims of a backstage confrontation at Madison Square Garden.  This led to a lengthy, crudely mocking discussion of an incident where Stern's girlfriend was allegedly spat on by a homeless man, portraying Stern as a coward for his reported response.  They further criticized Stern's perceived frustration with fans not migrating to his Sirius XM show. A caller's correction about the difference between psychiatrists and psychologists sparked a humorous tangent on medication and the hosts' aversion to therapy.  A listener suggested Stern may have staged the spitting incident. The segment also touched on Jimmy's appearance on *Lucky Louie*, speculation that *Family Guy* may have stolen a bit from Jimmy, and an upcoming interview with The Raconteurs (later corrected as The Rackin' Tours).  Anthony concluded this portion with a recounting of a frustrating flight experience on an old plane equipped with ashtrays.

The show then shifted to a discussion about an upcoming "mustache day," prompted by intern Bill's beard growth and evolving opinions on facial hair.  Anthony detailed his recent luxury cruise, including gambling, using Paltalk, and humorous (and often offensively phrased) interactions with staff.  This led to listener calls and anecdotes about "faggy" drinks, punctuated by numerous homophobic remarks and descriptions of ordering such drinks. The hosts promoted an upcoming show featuring The Rackin' Tours and discussed ticket giveaways.

A following segment focused on potential similarities between a *Family Guy* segment and a recurring bit by on-air personality Jimmy, examining Jimmy's comedic style and the state of contemporary comic strips, referencing his cartoonist brother Elmo.  Danny provided updates on the perceived similarities.  Anthony then recounted his disastrous return from his cruise, detailing mechanical issues with his flight from Puerto Rico, extensive delays, less-than-ideal airport staff, and a near-violent outburst.  He shared humorous anecdotes, complained about fellow passengers, and detailed a confrontation with a mother whose toddler was playing near airport baggage machinery.  Opie shared a listener's tip on airline passenger rights ("Rule 240").  The segment included brief discussions about various celebrities, including Chubby Checker, Tony Danza, Sylvester Stallone, and Sharon Stone, along with a humorous account of Jimmy receiving an inappropriately prepared omelet.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to Anthony's furious rant about The Chair Factory, using extremely vulgar language to describe his frustrating experience with undelivered bar stools.  This led to a broader discussion of poor customer service, with anecdotes from Opie and Jim Norton.  Listenersâ€™ emails and calls were mentioned as helpful in resolving such issues.  The show again promoted the upcoming Rackin' Tours show and discussed remaining tickets.  Opie expressed emotional distress regarding the movie trailer for "Flight 93," questioning its artistic merit and the motives of Universal Pictures.  This sparked a discussion of 9/11 conspiracy theories, countered by a New York City fireman's call expressing disgust at such theories.  Finally, the hosts discussed The Cars, with Anthony expressing anger and disbelief at Todd Rundgren's inclusion in the reformed band, recounting a past argument with him.  Music expert Earl briefly contributed to the discussion of the band's discography and different singers.

The final segment revisited the discussion of The Cars, specifically focusing on the roles of Rick Ocasek and Benjamin Orr, and the band's current lineup with Todd Rundgren.  The hosts debated which singer performed which songs, using highly offensive language to describe their disagreements and express strong criticism of Rundgren's participation.  Benjamin Orr's death was mentioned. The conversation included a humorous comparison of Rundgren to a "bag of douche."  The segment briefly mentioned the upcoming interview with The Rackin' Tours at the Hit Factory on XM.  The hosts concluded with further negative comments about Rundgren.

[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you.  More importantly, we see Derek's balls.  You just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Problem, Hawk?  My cross is burning so bad.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver, let's get the show on the road.  Fucking assholes.  I like that new one.  Oh, that's terrific, Steve.  Terrific.  A brand new intro for the Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:05:00]  We are live from New York City, baby.  Finally, finally.  Finally, let me just sun here for a moment.  Ah, basking in the new light of the studio.  I got some extra suntan lotion.  Yeah.  From vacation, left over.  I'm spreading it on.  Wow.  They certainly did cure the lighting problem in here.  It's like a movie set.  They got on with a spaceship, too. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, the spaceship's gone.  The UFO, which took up, I think, 15 feet of ceiling space.  So it actually looks bigger in here.  It feels like a much higher ceiling.  And it's brighter, so it feels like a radio studio.  Not a morgue like it did.  Bravo.  How about some credit for XM and what they have done?  We wanted this done by the time we got back from vacation. 
[00:06:00]  We wanted a couple of other things done.  But that's okay.  Wowee.  One step at a time.  Baby steps.  Wowee.  They installed lights.  Thank you.  See how they work?  They make us so excited that they put in some light bulbs.  And you know they're listening right now.  Well, they've got to finally compliment us.  All right.  There you go.  All right.  Thank you for the lights.  And that welcome mat out front.  Just a nice touch.  Thank you very much for bringing that while we were talking about.  Right.  That's lovely.  Thank you. 
[00:06:30]  We felt welcome.  And we have a new problem I'm noticing right off the bat.  What's that?  Mics are dropping out.  It started with me when I was talking over rage.  And then Jimmy had a fine comment right there.  And he dropped.  It dropped out?  It dropped out.  Like completely?  Or just a little volume?  I have no idea what that was about.  I noticed the mic sounded a little wacky.  Yeah, well.  I've turned up and down my headphones a little bit to compensate.  Feeling better now, though.  It's very strange to be back doing a live show.  What day is it?  Just to prove it to people. 
[00:07:00]  I believe it is Tuesday, the 4th of April, Opie.  I believe this is the ninth year in radio that we had not worked April 1st.  Whether it's falling on a weekend or a weekday or something.  We worked one April 1st together, I believe.  I was thinking that while I was on vacation.  I'm like, you know, April Fool's is coming up.  And once again, we will not be on the air.  We won't be on the air.  I do not remember. 
[00:07:30]  I do believe it was the day the mayor died that we said the mayor was dead.  And then after that, we had not worked an April Fool's since.  Do you realize that that was eight years ago?  Eight years we have not worked an April 1st.  Eight years ago.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ah, the trust they have in us.  But every day, you've got to hear the dopes out there.  They're hacks.  And they're not going to be around too long.  That's all right.  Look at the source. 
[00:08:00]  Shut up.  Look where that's coming from.  Just shut up and deal with it.  We're going to be here for a long time to come.  Let me say, do your own show.  Nah.  No, I'm not talking.  I added that in.  Ooh.  We're preaching to the choir, as they say.  We got our fans.  I know.  They're listening right now.  I'm sure some of them don't like certain people on the show.  But in general, they like the radio program.  Who doesn't like me?  I challenge one person who doesn't like me to call this program.  When I say they don't like you, I mean because they love you.  Atta boy, Ant. 
[00:08:30]  So this is the ONA virus spreading across America.  Thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  It's good to be back.  It's continuing to spread.  And, you know, I got a beat up whack bag just a little bit because.  Ooh.  Left and a right.  Ooh.  Well, there was a little travel problem with Anthony that he's going to get into in a minute here.  Of course there was.  So when all that was going down, I asked the boys to post that, look, we're supposed to  be back on the radio yesterday, Monday, but Anthony had a travel problem. 
[00:09:00]  And it's legit.  It really happened.  We'll get into it in a second here.  So please post on opianthony.com and whack bag and wherever else that, uh, unfortunately  we're going to have to, you know, uh, take another day and we'll start Tuesday right off  the bat.  Oh yeah.  Right.  They just want another day off.  Yeah.  Why can't you guys just believe us once?  Because we're liars.  We went, but we went out of our way to say, look, we apologize.  This is exactly what happened.  We're sorry, but we will be live on Tuesday. 
[00:09:30]  Right.  I mean, they didn't even give us the benefit of the doubt.  The first post.  Oh, sure.  This happened.  They just want another day off.  It took a couple of pages before somebody actually did, did some research and found that  I was posting because I posted in that thread from Puerto Rico.  They checked the IP.  It was coming out of Puerto Rico, uh, how they were able to tell.  I don't know.  It smelled like beans.  My, uh, my connection.  See this, the difference with this radio show is we really try not to lie. 
[00:10:00]  We, we do our best not to lie to each other and to our listeners.  Unlike dice and stern, you know, we were just talking about this before we went on the air  in radio.  You know, you could just make up shit and, uh, and change the history.  Yeah, because you said it.  And then people just start believing that that's the new thing.  We were standing there, nose to nose, getting into it at the garden.  Really?  We were not. 
[00:10:30]  Hey, Jacob, you don't remember?  I think, you know, I have to attribute it to the Alzheimer's.  The guy has to have Alzheimer's.  He gets nothing right.  He's a dottering old fool, as they say.  Dottering old fool.  Well, obviously we're done with dice.  You know, he's a fucking liar.  Everyone knows it now.  I mean, we got hours and hours and hours and hours and hours of tape, uh, of him being  on our show, enjoying being on our show. 
[00:11:00]  We did some great things together.  We were just saying before the show, his latest CD, he thanked us.  Yeah.  He thanked us for, uh, helping him get back to, uh, to Madison Square Garden.  These are all facts, but for some reason he's so desperate he has to go on Howard and completely  trash us and say, and say some horrific things that, you know, payback's going to be a bitch  for Howard and, and, and fucking dice.  Trust me on that.  Oh.  Trust me on that one.  Oh.  Let me say it again.  Trust me on that.  Oh. 
[00:11:30]  Trust me on that.  Oh.  Oh.  One, one more.  Trust me on that.  Oh.  Oh, shit.  Oh, Howard thinks he's so fucking brave with his microphone.  Well, this is a whole, whole new thing you just got into, pal.  A whole new thing.  Righty-o.  You're going to wish it's just homeless people bothering you on the street, you crime fighter  faggot.  Crime fighter.  I'm super Howie.  It was a man, uh, spitting, Robin. 
[00:12:00]  Wow.  It's really brave to get a homeless guy arrested.  Is he just some homeless kook?  Dude, I live in the neighborhood.  It's one of these homeless guys.  They ask you for change, and sometimes you don't want to be bothered, so you kind of walk  by, and so they give you a little attitude.  Yeah.  And they get in your face a little bit, and you just kind of walk away.  No, you got to act a little crazy.  That's my tact.  If you just walk away, they might see it as a weakness.  You got to turn around, and it doesn't matter what you say.  You could just go, back to the bacon! 
[00:12:30]  You know, it doesn't matter as long as it's loud, and then they leave you alone.  You know, and the news reports it that it was some, um, some fan.  It wasn't a fan.  That's some fan you got there.  How is a homeless guy that lives in a, his, uh, official address is some shelter.  Yeah.  Maybe he was a fan.  That's a fan?  Where's he getting the money to, you know, to, to, to get his, uh, satellite radio?  That's the problem.  He's probably a fan.  He, uh, injured himself trying to lift the serious unit. 
[00:13:00]  Wasn't able to work.  Lost his job.  Ended up homeless on the street.  See what, uh, subscribing to that company will get you?  So that's, uh, one of the big stories.  Howard the Crime Fighter.  Oof.  They're so fucking brave.  It's my, uh, cape, Robin.  Just wait, Howard.  Just wait.  Ah, you're brave with your microphone.  Let's see what happens next time, uh, we see you in the park.  It was actually a loogie.  Actually a lunger that was spit in, uh, Beth's face.  What happened?  It's supposedly through a cab window. 
[00:13:30]  That's a good shot.  As a, as he's fleeing the scene.  That's a great shot.  God, he's like the fucking Oswald of phlegm.  He got through the open fucking cab window.  Hit her in the head.  Well, they actually think there was another spitter.  Was there?  Through the other window, yeah.  Yeah, through the other window.  Another homeless guy.  And on the New York radio message board, the, the first post about it was, God, I hope  the guy isn't an O&A pass.  Oh, I know.  Everybody was speculating on various message boards that it was one of ours. 
[00:14:00]  Trust me.  One of ours.  Trust me.  I had a really big laugh over that one.  I wouldn't put it past one of our guys, but, uh, no, it wasn't.  It was, uh, just some crazy homeless guy.  But Dyson's lies, one of the many things we'll get into this week, trust me, you know.  But, uh, I, I guess he's desperate.  You know, when he was coming around doing our show, we were helping him get, you know,  into Madison Square Garden again.  And he says, what, we went toe-to-toe at the garden arguing about stuff?  Yeah, that there was some problem.  We went backstage with him and his ex-wife and his kids watching the Mets and the Yankees.  It was nothing but a good time, uh, that whole experience. 
[00:14:30]  Dyson's going to make believe that me and him didn't go out after the entire crowd left.  He goes, come here.  And he walks me out to Madison Square Garden in the middle as they're cleaning up.  And he goes, I want to take a picture of this to remember this.  And he had a tear in his eye.  Yeah.  There's an actual picture out there of just me and Dice with him being very proud that  he got to play Madison Square Garden again.  He's going to, he's going to lie about all that.  Dude, the guy was done.  He was done completely.  He was playing clubs here and there, maybe getting, uh, one of the small rooms in Vegas 
[00:15:00]  or something.  I don't know.  He was done.  We kind of had him on a few times.  We were making fun, kind of revitalizing his persona here.  And then he comes out, he hears about it through Kenny, who was in Jersey, comes on the show,  made him a part of the show, uh, got people back into him again.  Enough so where he was able to book Madison Square Garden, not through other people's shows. 
[00:15:30]  He wasn't promoting this all over the place.  We were the only outlet.  We were it.  It was, it was, it was an O and A production brought to you by Opie and Anthony.  That's how it was billed.  We brought Dice to the garden and it went swimmingly.  Everyone had fun.  There was no confrontation, nothing.  The relationship was still good after the whole garden thing for quite a while.  Well, but, uh, he chooses to, uh, rewrite history. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, he's gonna change history now.  Now, we're, we're bad guys, I guess.  Just so he can sell a few tickets for governors on Long Island.  Go ahead, have fun.  That's a big drop-off, don't you think?  They're Dice.  Have fun.  Both of them can just sit there and, uh, wax fantastic about, uh, 1986 and, uh, talk about  the good old days.  It's done.  Done.  He's done.  And, uh, anyway, let's, uh, let's go to the phone and say hi to Pat in Boston.  Pat, what's up? 
[00:16:30]  Hey, boys, I just wanted to know if, uh, Howie made a citizen's arrest there.  I also want you to get arrested to fucking Boston.  Let's go.  Chop, chop.  All right, yeah, opening day yesterday, baby.  I guess Curt Schilling had a good outing.  Care.  Did, did Howie make a citizen's arrest on the homeless guy?  Was it a citizen's arrest?  I heard he was, uh, he was, uh, taken around by the police.  And then, uh, they, they searched the area.  Well, he made sure.  Howie spotted the guy.  He made sure his chick was back in the luxury, uh, apartment on 67th and Columbus Avenue. 
[00:17:00]  And then called the cops and then he jumped in, like, in a, in a cop car, an unmarked car  and searched the neighborhood for this, for this, quote, deranged fan.  And found him.  Obviously, it's not a deranged fan if you're jumping in a cop car and you can find him easily.  That's him, officer.  That's him.  It's obviously a homeless guy just hanging out on a corner somewhere.  I miss had a great point this morning.  We were watching him this morning.  He goes, what the hell is he doing, um, taking a cab with all that, uh, serious money? 
[00:17:30]  The obvious, man.  I miss just had the obvious right there.  Uh, let's say hi to Jim in Brooklyn.  What's up, Jim?  Need a tank.  The thing that made me laugh about that article, and Opie, you kind of just brought it up, was  at the end of the article, it said, Howard, from the safety of the unmarked police car,  identified the homeless guy or the fan.  It's like, come on, Howard, you couldn't get out and identify the guy?  Get out, confront him face to face.  If he spit on your chick's face, you'd have to, uh, confront him. 
[00:18:00]  Of course.  Like that.  It was, it was, he stayed in the car.  You ever see when, like, a chick gets raped, and, uh, the police drive her around to try  to find the rapist, and through the tinted window, she goes, oh my god, that's it!  Oh my god!  It's okay.  It's okay.  Time to get to the hospital and start the swabbing.  You know?  That's what Howie did.  It just proves that he's a coward. 
[00:18:30]  There's a guy that spit in my girlfriend's face.  He's a coward.  Get out and go, hey, dick face.  Why are you spitting in my chick's face?  And spit in his face.  What are the cops gonna do?  He's like a 6'9 monster.  And this guy, obviously, is just a homeless guy.  Homeless guy.  You have to jump in a cab, and it's very obvious.  Because I'm, I'm kind of like a Columbo type guy.  Ooh.  It is very obvious to me that Howard, because of his stupid ego, and it's all about him, 
[00:19:00]  he got in the cab first, or Beth would not have gotten spit on.  It is so obvious to me.  Oh, oh, like using her as a little block?  Think about it.  All right?  Right.  Think about it.  Homeless guy's giving you problems, not a deranged fan.  Yeah.  You know?  All of a sudden, they hail a cab.  He had to go in first.  This is JFK shit.  He did get in.  He had to have gotten in first.  He had to get in first, because it's all about him. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, or the spitting guy.  How else would the spitting guy, what, he would run around to the other side of the cab  to spit in Howard's girlfriend's face?  In normal circumstances, it is convenient sometimes for the guy to get in first, because  then you've got to do the slide over, and then the girl can just get in.  But in that situation, you want to put, right, you're putting, you've got to  put yourself in the way of the spitter.  The danger.  I'm telling you guys, he's the biggest pussy alive.  He's a fucking coward.  Beth, protect me, Beth.  Protect me. 
[00:20:00]  He's a coward.  They hailed the cab, and it is no doubt in my mind, she went in last.  That's the only way the freaking guy could have spit on her.  She took the big, honking, homeless, phlegmy, loogie in the face, because Howie didn't want  to get in between.  Think about it.  Don't freaking take my word for it.  Read the articles, and it's very obvious.  Very obvious.  The conversation's going on in front of you, right?  The cab pulls up.  Right.  All right?  If she went in first, that's what a real man would do. 
[00:20:30]  Then the guy would have to run around to the other side of the cab.  Hopefully, that window is open and spit on her face.  Right.  No, that's not how it happened.  Howard jumped in first, because he's the biggest pussy alive, and then goes, oh, all  right, and then pulls Beth in, possibly.  Door shuts.  Loogie flies.  Door's not even shut yet, I'm thinking.  I heard it was through the open window.  So, if she shut it through the open window, loogie.  There you go.  Oh.  There's your brain. 
[00:21:00]  There's your brain.  Homeless shock shock.  Let me tell you something.  Listen, I don't, homeless, loogie, on me, I'd be in a padded room.  I would be in a padded room.  Because you know something got in the mouth, like part of the booger spit?  Yeah.  Ew.  One of those.  Let's go to Kevin in Jersey.  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to know if Howie identified the guy from the Howie Copter.  High above Manhattan. 
[00:21:30]  The Howie Copter.  I don't know, you know.  I'm sure he knows a few cops, right?  Dude.  We all know the cops.  You know what you do?  Here's what really happens.  Let me tell you what really happens.  You drive around.  You find the guy.  They tune him up a little bit.  You tune him up a little bit.  He's a homeless guy.  You know what he's going to get?  Nothing.  You go through the whole legal channels of, that's him.  I identified him.  Now let's book him. 
[00:22:00]  He's a lunatic.  He's going to be back in his shelter.  He doesn't have money.  He's not going to spend time in jail.  You get you and your cop friends.  You go around the corner somewhere.  You put the guy in the car.  You go around the corner.  Yeah, 50s style.  You teach him a little what's what with the nightsticks.  Bam, bam.  The cops let you get a few shots in, right?  And then you leave him in the gutter there.  And you drive away laughing.  You take him to class at Shoe Leather University. 
[00:22:30]  Shoe Leather U.  That's how it works.  Right.  A little tune-up.  And the cops let you join in because he disrespected your girl.  That's how it works.  Not, there he is.  You know, in all fairness, Howard's a very smart guy as far as marketing himself.  And he saw another opportunity to get his name in the paper.  I bet you this incident was nothing like it was reported. 
[00:23:00]  Nothing like it was reported.  Little harassment.  Quick, quick.  Call the Daily News.  9-1-1.  I mean 9-1-1.  Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  He had someone call the papers immediately.  Immediately.  Let's say hi to Frank in New York City.  Frank, what's up?  Good morning, guys.  Hey.  First thing I saw when I saw that Daily News headline is, oh my god, fucking Opie lost it and went after him.  Yeah.  I've got to be honest.  I think for a couple of seconds I, too, thought maybe it was Opie.  Greg Opie Hughes, who you might remember from the St. Pat's Institute. 
[00:23:30]  A little west side community.  Screw it.  I lost it.  That's all right.  Well, Howard had some brave things to say about my dad when Dice was on.  So let's see how this one plays out, Howie.  Let's see how brave you really are.  I've got to be honest.  I think we're listening to himself.  Let's see how brave you really are.  Let's go to Neil in Jersey.  Neil, what's going on?  Hi, guys.  I was wondering if you guys heard about Howard being upset with his fans for not signing up with Sirius. 
[00:24:00]  Oops.  He was doing the Howie math.  I guess the little doggy company is up to, what, four mil now?  Yeah.  And we just announced yesterday six and a half mil.  Right.  And Howie's bummed and yelling at his fans that not more of them followed him to the little doggy company.  He actually thought that when he announced he was going over there that all of his fans, his millions of fans from around the country, all of his markets that he was in on broadcast radio, were all going to just rush over and sign up. 
[00:24:30]  It doesn't work that way for anybody.  It didn't work that way for us.  You've got to come here.  You've got to do a satellite show, do an entertaining show, and once again, build an audience.  We just did that live broadcast at St. Paddy's, Hard Rock Cafe for St. Paddy's Day, just before we went on break, I guess.  And I was talking to some of the listeners after the show, you know, wandering around the crowd, and we were doing a signing and whatnot.  And it still surprises me.  It's like, oh, you guys rock, you know, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:25:00]  And I'm like, yeah, how long have you been listening?  Ah, I just got it for my birthday last month.  And you get so frustrated.  It's like, why didn't you guys jump aboard right away?  You missed, you idiot.  But we understand.  I mean, you've got bills to pay.  You've got to figure out, all right, well, can I get the satellite radio now?  I am a huge fan of these guys, but I can't afford it right now.  Maybe I'll get it for Christmas.  Maybe I'll get it for my birthday.  So you do have that frustration.  Then there's other people that don't know it.  But to yell at your fans about it is like, what is wrong with you?  There's also people that still don't even know what the fuck satellite is. 
[00:25:30]  They don't even know what it is.  We, like, we're on broadcast.  We went to something called satellite.  I don't know what it is.  I can't be bothered.  You're just going to get that.  Right.  You've got to understand.  You can't then start yelling at your fans for not signing up.  And there's still really hardcore fans.  Another situation, not to plug the Bros Restaurant, but FH Rally's in Huntington there.  I run into people all the time.  And they're huge fans of ours, right?  And I'm like, wow, man, that's so cool. 
[00:26:00]  You know, what do you think of the new show?  What do you think of XM?  I don't have it yet.  I don't have it yet.  I'm like, well, when are you going to get it?  Didn't you like our show?  You're even coming out of your way to go to my brother's restaurant.  That's how much of a fan you are, but you don't actually have the new program yet.  It takes time.  It's a slow build.  So Entertainment Weekly asks, does it bother you that most of your fans haven't followed you to Sirius?  Howie's response, I was just at my psychiatrist.  So why do you think your fans haven't come to your show? 
[00:26:30]  Just picture that.  Dr. Melfi.  Dr. Melfi, my fans, they haven't come aboard.  I'm very upset about this whole thing.  I was under the impression they would all sign up.  Every one of my millions of fans.  Why do you think that is, that your fans haven't signed up? 
[00:27:00]  Oh, that's an annoying voice you got there, honey.  Someone's got to explain a psychiatrist to me someday, man.  My mom has been in and out of these offices her entire life, and it hasn't done shit.  Hey, old guy, get away from me and Beth.  Gotcha, the malignia.  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  You know, I'm probably entering dangerous territory, big surprise here for me, but I don't get the 
[00:27:30]  psychiatrist thing.  No.  I'm sure there's people listening right now going, hey, they helped me.  That's terrific.  Hey, I'll be Cruz.  I feel probably I need to talk to somebody.  Probably.  Probably.  Do you think?  But who doesn't?  That's what I'm saying.  Who doesn't?  And how do you go through this process?  All of a sudden, you find a psychiatrist, you go in there once or twice a week, what have  you.  You're on the clock, and you expect this guy to really give a shit about what you're telling 
[00:28:00]  him?  I don't get it.  I can't see past that alone.  He pushed me out of the car!  You finally get to some kind of big, huge breakthrough, and all of a sudden, the guy goes, well, we'll  have to...  And time.  And time.  We'll have to pick up next week with that point.  But what if I forget?  Yeah.  What if I forget, like...  But it took me years to...  Yeah, to reach this point.  To reach this point.  Yeah, but I got another appointment waiting in the lobby, and they're suicidal, and I 
[00:28:30]  gotta go now.  But I just remembered.  Pay the receptionist on the way out.  Like, I don't get it.  I don't get the psychiatrist thing.  Well, from what I read...  I get the drug thing.  But those are the psychologists.  Why not?  I get the psychologist thing.  I don't get the psychiatrist thing.  But from what I read, he went to this shrink because he wanted to be a better dad.  That's what he said.  Because he was putting his career first, and, you know, I guess his family life was suffering. 
[00:29:00]  Obviously.  So when his dad dies, I guess we all get to have fun, like, making fun of his dead dad?  No, no, no.  Real brave, Howard.  Real fucking brave.  You know what?  Real fucking brave.  A little, uh...  A little knowledge for the guy.  Everyone drops dead.  And the older you get, the closer you are to dropping dead.  Real fucking brave.  So your father...  Bah! 
[00:29:30]  He's an old guy, right?  It's probably gonna happen.  Yeah, we'll see how...  I think you'll feel bad about it.  Yeah, we'll see how you handle your dad's death.  I think you're gonna feel a little bad about it.  Real fucking brave.  And I really don't think you're gonna appreciate people making fun of it.  Right?  I'll be...  I'll go on the record right now.  I'll...  I would never make fun of that.  Yeah.  I would never make fun of that.  Nope.  But, you know, a pussy like him would.  A pussy like him would.  Real fucking brave, Howie.  Real brave.  Yeah. 
[00:30:00]  Your dad's gonna die, you asshole.  And then what?  Yeah, and then what?  And then what?  You make fun?  You make fun of your own dad?  You're a fucking pussy.  And you got a lot coming your way, buddy.  Does it bother you that most of your fans haven't followed you to Sirius?  Sounds like street jackhammering or something.  Wow.  Dude, they're building a new building right next door.  I've never heard it, though, in the studio, like in my headphones.  No, I hear that now. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Wow, okay, we got another year and a half of that to look forward to.  Oh, you haven't even talked to the guys.  Right outside their window in the big office, they just demolished the building.  It was like taking a tooth out here in Manhattan.  Yeah, they pulled a building.  It is so fucked up what they do in Manhattan.  It was like taking a tooth out.  There was a huge building right next to us where the boys sit.  And right outside that window, they just decided to take this building away.  Yeah.  How the fuck do you figure out how to do that?  Without messing up this building or the building next door? 
[00:31:00]  Holy unbelievable distraction.  That is going to be.  No, just because you can feel it vibrating, actually, on your arms.  You can feel it and hear it.  You feel that?  Huh?  You ever see a building come apart like that?  All right.  That's how the building laughs.  So here's the answer.  I was just at my psychiatrist, and I said, I just got great news.  We hit the $4 million mark, and I'm angry. 
[00:31:30]  Ooh.  It should be $20 million.  It should be.  It should be, let's say, a gazillion, gazillion.  It should be $20 million.  Hey, ass, it don't work that way.  Why?  Is that when your next bonus kicks in, you fucking idiot?  You're making so much money.  Why don't you buy the radios for your fans?  That would be a huge fucking thing.  Hey, there you go.  You want, there, there's some free marketing for you, Howie.  Buy a few.  You're making a half billion on your latest contract, even more, they're saying. 
[00:32:00]  So why don't you take a few million of those and just hand out free radios to your fans?  There you go.  Their friends listen.  More people get turned on to it.  That's how it works in satellite.  That's how it works in regular radio.  It's a lot of word of mouth, billboards, the advertisement.  It's not that.  You've got to put on a show that people want to listen to.  That's fun.  That makes it sound like you want to be there on a daily basis and you're not just drawing a paycheck.  Then it's amazing. 
[00:32:30]  People come on board.  You should have learned that from earlier in your career because that's how that happened.  So it goes on.  It's insulting to me that everyone hasn't come with me.  I take it personally.  The competitive thing is a sickness that eats at me.  I want to say to my audience in this article, and I quote, this is Howard Stern, to his listeners,  fuck you.  You haven't come with me yet.  How dare you?  How dare you?  There you go.  Yik.  There you go.  Yikes.  Put him in a psychiatrist's office with Dr. Melfi. 
[00:33:00]  Why the built-up anger about you?  You know he's going to have to go to the psychiatrist and talk about him being a crime fighter.  Now I feel a responsibility to Metropolis here.  I'm wearing Super Howie, and the cape gets in the way.  What's his power going to be?  What's his superpower going to be?  My superpowers.  Able to leave tall bags of money. 
[00:33:30]  I can insult people from 100 yards away.  From the safety of a cop car.  From the safety of his cop car.  Meanwhile, back in the cab, his loogie-strewn girlfriend...  Riding around in the back seat with a bag over his head, with Gene Hackman on one side,  Willem Dafoe on the other, like that black kid in Mississippi, Bernie.  Fucking crime fighter. 
[00:34:00]  Super Howie.  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  Ah, God.  Too good, man.  Too good.  Let's see.  Let's say hi to Mike in Nevada.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, I just wanted to know if this settles the spitting as a crime debate now.  Ha, ha, there you go.  Oh, yeah, we started that.  Yeah.  Because there's a few people I need to...  Wow, that's probably why people thought this was...  To spit on, yeah.  Well, you know what? 
[00:34:30]  I was happy to find out that it wasn't a felony.  Well, I can tell you here, it's a battery.  I'm arrested for it.  Hey, are we taping Lord into internet porn at age 13?  Justin Berry, former teen porn star, speaks out.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Lord into internet porn.  Wait a minute.  This guy, this kid's a former porn star?  Oh, Justin Berry, yeah.  A former teen porn star.  You don't know this guy.  Yeah, no, you don't cry, Jimmy.  I hope not. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, I thought it was just some schmo in junior high, you know, just...  But it was one of our interns.  And he looked like one.  Hi, can I get you coffee?  You need some cream in that?  Justin Berry was forced to suck cock on camera after he forgot to bring coffee two days in a row.  All right, thank you, sir.  All right, thanks, man.  All right, let's go to Mike in Cleveland.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, I actually saw an episode on Seinfeld.  The magic loogie.  Yes.  That's a great episode.  What a shit dick.  Punching out.  All right, let's go to Alicia in North Carolina. 
[00:35:30]  Alicia.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hi, you're on.  You're on the air.  Hi, I'm sorry.  I thought it was the guys.  I wanted to clear up for you guys that a psychiatrist is the one that prescribes the medication,  not a psychologist.  And I'm a little disappointed that...  Well, thank God I don't know that.  ...didn't get that.  Who didn't get that?  Excuse me?  What are you disappointed in, sweetie?  Oh, that Professor Anthony didn't pick the one.  I don't know much about that stuff either.  You have your shit, and you deal with it. 
[00:36:00]  It's called crosses to bear.  We've all got them.  Thank you.  We certainly do.  So there's a psychologist and a psychiatrist, so why can't it be the same person?  What do you mean?  Is one less schooling?  Yes.  A psychologist is a PhD, and a psychiatrist is an actual medical doctor.  So psychologists, you get to lay on the couch, and they give you the good drugs, right?  No.  The psychologist cannot give you medication.  Psychiatrists can give you drugs.  All right.  And I messed it up again.  So psychiatrists are giving you the whatever Howie's on. 
[00:36:30]  What do you think he's probably on?  Probably a slight dosage of Prozac, I would think.  I'd say Prozac, maybe slight, just a little bit to take the edge off, or maybe a little  vitamin V.  A little lithium, gives you the people that white shit in the corner of their mouth.  You ever talk to someone, yeah, I'm doing much better now, and they always have that  fucking pasty white stuff in their mouth corner?  Awful sour breath.  Dried milk in their mouth.  You know, that's, I've thought about this for a long time.  You know, and I know I probably need to talk to someone, you know, but I just figured 
[00:37:00]  it would take the edge off, and I would just be sitting here like, everything is great  today.  Everything's good.  Opie.  Hi, Anthony.  How are you today?  Opie, you want to do something?  You want to press a button or something, anything?  So what are you up to?  All right, here's the deal.  I got some Valium on vacation.  Yeah.  I'll get into my fine story in a little while.  I will take a nice hit of Valium tomorrow, and I'll just sit here, and this is how I'll  be every day if I actually went to talk to somebody. 
[00:37:30]  You want to do drug day?  Yeah, we'll do drug day.  You're on there?  Because I got some Vicodin at home.  You got the Vicodin?  So we could do some, well, Jimmy's out of this.  No, I did this gag already for a few years.  Well, we're both mellow, and he's being carted out by the EMS with bleeding wrists.  There goes the fun in that bitch.  Look, I just want to guarantee that we're not going to get fired for this.  See how smart we've gotten in our years?  Are they prescription?  And they're prescribed to you. 
[00:38:00]  They're prescribed to you.  Yeah, I got it from a third world hospital.  Okay.  That's right.  They were smuggled in some woman's vagina.  Nice.  Hence the flavor.  Because a lot of people have emailed me.  They're like, why don't you go talk?  Why don't you just talk to someone?  Ronnie said it on the Ronnie and Fez show.  Yeah.  You know, because I know they'll give me a little something to take the edge off, and  then it's like my part of the show is going to be really boring.  A little Paxil.  I'll just be like, that's really great, Anthony.  Jimmy, how was your vacation? 
[00:38:30]  I don't want your killer instinct gone.  I like it.  I don't want it gone.  He'll be all like, his cracks will be all like, sweet.  Bubba the Love Sponge.  Better than Bubba the Love Mop.  Can I have a napkin for the white pasty stuff?  No, but they never know they have it.  You just talk with that thousand-yard marine stare, and it's like little white rubber bands  in the corner of their mouth.  They never break, and you just want to pull them off and sniff them.  No, you don't.  You do.  And then when they're talking, you hear that... 
[00:39:00]  That smacking kind of dry mouth thing.  You're fucking better off just living crazy and fucking sticking your head in front of  a train five years sooner than boring everyone and fucking...  There's nothing worse than a medicated person.  I'm so with you.  Don't want to get into it too much.  It's scary.  Because, you know, it has affected my life.  I'm so with you.  Medication stinks.  Think he's on any?  Oh, absolutely. 
[00:39:30]  Absolutely.  That's our opinion, obviously.  Bill in Brooklyn, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Oh, Bill.  Billy Boy, thanks for calling.  Listen, I'm a cop, and I punched up that report yesterday, and I didn't see nothing in  that report about spitting.  There was no spitting.  There was no real fear.  It was just a dumb situation that you've got to deal with when you live in Manhattan.  Happens on a daily basis.  Happens to all of us on a daily basis. 
[00:40:00]  Whether you're famous or, you know, commuting from Long Island to a shitty job, it happens  to you.  We have a guy right out here that's pretty fucking scary with the Jewish homeless guy.  All right, look, he is Jewish homeless.  That's a one in a million shot.  But he's a Jewish homeless guy.  He's very aggressive.  He's very aggressive, and he has like a pit bull.  He's got a dog.  He's got a killer dog.  Yeah.  That's on a really, really, really thick chain.  And if you look at him, even sometimes if you don't look at him, but if you do look 
[00:40:30]  at him, he'll say like, hey, what are you doing?  How about some help here?  You know?  And then as you just turn and ignore him and walk away, he'll start bad-mouthing you.  He starts just going at you.  Yeah.  A pushy Jew, though.  What are the odds?  Oh, shit.  But these people, unfortunately, are all over New York City.  This is something you deal with.  Jews?  Oh, homeless.  And this is something you deal with if you live and work in Manhattan.  Yes.  Live or work and or whatever.  He says stuff to everyone but Anthony.  He can just sense not to talk to Anthony. 
[00:41:00]  Don't talk to me.  You know, it is getting warmer.  I'm going to have to give up the parka.  When you read this report, this guy is going to be let go because it's basically harassment  and the cops didn't have witnessed it, so nothing's going to happen to this guy.  You know, if we just happened to get the report, you know, who knows where it came from, to  be honest with you.  Yeah, if it was, you know, delivered here.  If it just happened to be dropped off or something.  We'd love to see it.  We certainly would.  Like I said, I couldn't be wrong.  We certainly would.  I don't recall seeing anything in there about spitting.  There was no spitting.  Punch it out, guys. 
[00:41:30]  Take care.  There was no spitting and there was no real threat.  But it's a way of getting your name in the paper, so, you know, God bless you for keeping  the name in the paper.  Seems to work for him.  All right.  Let's go to Chris in Boston.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, welcome back, gentlemen.  Hey, man.  Listen, Anthony, I need to ask you a question.  Yeah.  Hypothetically, had this been you with your girlfriend, would she find the same fate as  the booger couch?  But, honey, I'm sorry. 
[00:42:00]  I can't.  Sorry, I'm going to have to let you go.  Just wondering, man.  Welcome back, boys.  All right.  Thank you.  Well, they said the spit went into the mouth and eyes and nose or something like that.  I was reading it in the daily.  That's a big loogie.  It was just probably like a, I forget where it said, where's the spit?  You guys do it.  I just can't find where it was.  I shouldn't have mentioned it.  Was it one of those big, like, rubber bandy ones that kind of, as they're flying through  the air, go, weep, weep, weep, weep, they stretch in different directions before  they hit, and some got in her mouth. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, dude.  Nice, salty, homeless loogie.  And then he spat into her face, into her mouth, her face, and her eyes.  She's freaking out.  Homeless spit.  In your eye.  That could be HIV.  And in your mouth.  Could be HIV.  You could probably get one up your nose.  You're going to smell it all night.  Oh.  Let's go to Sean in Virginia.  Sean.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, Opie, you were talking about how he getting his name in the paper?  Yeah.  You think he might have paid that guy, like Bobby Bacala, that rapper paid Bobby Bacala? 
[00:43:00]  Oh, and the Sopranos.  That was a good episode.  All right.  Peace.  Yeah, but he fucking shot him in the air.  How fucking funny was that?  He was supposed to shoot him in the leg.  That was the beauty of it.  And now he's going to be like a laughingstock.  Not a shot in the ass.  No, well, now there's going to be problems with the black rapping community.  Setting up a nice storyline for the Sopranos that they'll never get to.  Eh, they'll never.  What happened to the guy running in the woods?  I just want to know where he was.  He's still hiding.  He's very scared, Opie.  He's hiding behind a tree. 
[00:43:30]  I just want to know where that guy is.  He thinks that Paulie's still after him.  And incidentally, this is, as of today, this is the first time we've been live on the air  that I have been caught up with the Sopranos completely.  Oh, good for you.  And I love this season.  I really do.  I really like it, man, a lot.  And you two, by the way, fucking shittiest dream analysis I've ever heard.  I'm kind of getting into the dream thing.  And what did I say shitty?  The whole beacon thing?  What do you fucking maniacs say,  that's because he doesn't have his ID.  That's the airport overanalyzing.  Some caller said that. 
[00:44:00]  Whoever it was.  I just said that it was a beacon.  It was a heart monitor.  Obviously, boom, boom, it was a monitor.  But it's a beacon.  Yeah, that was the light.  Oh, no light.  No, the light is the flashlight that the Chinese guy keeps shining in his eye.  I love it, though.  Yeah.  I'm kind of digging the alter ego personality thing,  the Alzheimer thing that he's doing there.  That's pretty cool.  And it's kind of funny to hear him without his Tony Soprano accent.  Well, you obviously, because you had a problem. 
[00:44:30]  You didn't get to see The Sopranos on Sunday.  I have a DVR.  He's moving around now.  I hear.  He's moving around now.  I hear.  He actually left the hospital Sunday.  I hear.  That's it for now.  It was a great episode.  I'm not going to say what happened just because there was a Lucky Lou promo before it.  I mean, can I only say it.  Dude, I hate my DVR.  It's cutting off shit that's frustrating the hell out of me.  Coming attractions.  Dude.  DVR cuts off.  That's the problem with the DVR.  It cuts off.  It's not like a timed thing where you can extend either side a minute or so on autopilot. 
[00:45:00]  It's frustrating because exactly for the reason Jimmy just said.  I go, ah, Sopranos.  That's right.  I taped it before I left.  Awesome.  So I push play, and it starts with just a graphic that says Lucky Louie.  That's all you get.  It was the end of the obvious promo, and I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?  Were you in it?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I tune in.  I get a â€“ I just tune it on.  And you're right.  Like, Tebow, you could actually set a minute or two early and a minute or two later.  But for some reason, DVR maybe just picks up the whole show like it should. 
[00:45:30]  I tune in.  All of a sudden, I see myself.  There was a scene I did with a gun in the kitchen table, and I see myself at the very  end of that line, and then a couple of the promos with Louie's wife, Pam, and him.  And I was like, oh, wow, they promo the show.  I had no idea.  That is really cool.  Yeah, I was very happy.  It was kind of fun, but I wish I would have seen more.  Jimmy's part of Lucky Louie on HBO.  That starts in June after Entourage.  Two months of promo they're giving it, which hopefully we â€“  That is amazing.  But it was kind of cool to turn myself on â€“ or turn on and see myself.  All right.  Yeah, good point here. 
[00:46:00]  Someone didn't miss the boat on this one.  Scott in Philly, what's up?  Yeah, how you doing?  I just want to point out the obvious, that every other time The Sopranos have ever come up,  Jimmy goes, yuck.  And now that he's on HBO, it's his favorite show in the world.  No, dude, I do understand what a worm I am at times, but I will defend myself.  In our time off, I bought all â€“ I think it was four, because Nick DiPaolo, actually,  on Tough Crowd kept going, you've got to watch it, dude.  So I finally went out and bought them, and I fell in love with the show on our time off.  We were doing Tough Crowd.  And I got caught up, and the first time I watched, I missed the first three, 
[00:46:30]  and then I watched them all, like, last week on vacation, and I'm finally caught up.  It's a great show, though.  I can't â€“ I would love to shit on it, because it's pop culture.  But you can't not â€“ that mother is the greatest fucking character in â€“  Go shit in your hat!  It's all I want to say to people.  Noah was coming on strong.  Always was a great character by the Pauly.  Oh, holy crap.  It was great.  I'll say this latest episode, man, I was laughing so freaking hard, man. 
[00:47:00]  I just couldn't take it.  What a motherfucker he is.  Oh, he's great.  They all got fat, though.  Fucking Gandolfini is huge.  Yep.  Even Christopher's, like, got a ponk on.  A little bit, man.  Yeah, all that good living, all those free meals.  Fucking Sirico got a little heavy, and Van Zandt definitely put weight on.  Everyone except Meadow.  And the youngster.  She's looking really hot.  Holy mackerel.  She's looking really hot.  Uh, let's see.  Oh, God.  All right.  Let's move on to Candyman.  Candyman, what's up? 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  Hey, I can't believe you guys missed the obvious reason why Pauly had him arrested.  He was missing the crime fighter badge for his Boy Scout uniform.  There you go.  Fucking hell, guys.  Yeah, the crime fighter badge on his little Boy Scout uniform.  That's terrific.  Hoo-hoo.  Do we have audio, by the way?  I would rather get into it once we have audio of that fucking Georgia Democrat who's accused  of hitting the cop when she was walking through, like, bypassing security of that congressperson? 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, I don't think we have.  There was an interview she did on, I saw it was 18 minutes on Wolf Blitzer, and that  left-wing douche actually tried to corner her a little bit.  Yeah.  So if anyone has it off CNN, maybe Ben or one of those guys, we have to have that audio.  Well, I wish we had audio of me at the airport.  Yeah, why don't we take a break, get into that.  Oh.  I heard you had a good trip.  He had Anthony...  I had one of the best cruise times ever, right up until I had to come home. 
[00:48:30]  And, uh, whew, havoc.  Dude, I'm surprised you had problems on Continental.  Um, I wasn't on Continental.  When you fly to some of these places, you don't have the choice.  You know...  I had to fly American Airlines, I wasn't happy about that.  I like the direct flight, and sometimes you have to sacrifice the airline for the direct  flight.  American's been around a while, I'd flown it before, not right, they don't have that nice  young fleet like Continental has. 
[00:49:00]  It can't be on a plane that still has ashtrays.  Wait, ashtrays...  Oh my god, I'm like, how old is this fucking plane?  I mean, and this is the flight where the wire decides to, you know, disintegrate or come  apart or what have you.  Mine said, Godspeed, Lucky Lindy.  I saw it in the cockpit.  Make it across.  I thought the big planes aren't supposed to have propellers.  Ashtrays.  You're right.  Ashtrays.  And they try to cover them up like they were never there.  These weren't here.  Just fucking take them out, please.  It would make me a little calmer. 
[00:49:30]  I gotta say to relax, you guys, and I'm fucking Nick Nervous when I fly.  Even newer planes sometimes, they will use the old seats.  So a lot of times, the interior is old, like old pieces.  Like, they'll just pull an old seat out, but the engine is brand new.  So a lot of times, believe me, I saw that too, and I almost shit.  And I saw the plane was relatively new.  That's what I tell myself.  Have you ever, like, worked on a car or had a friend work on a car, and they put a new  engine in their old car?  I have actually had that happen.  How long does that car really work? 
[00:50:00]  It's not good.  Right.  Never good.  There's always something that wasn't put back together right, or they forgot to do this  little thing.  There's always nuts and bolts, mate.  That they never needed.  Right.  You know, you took them out.  Eh, we don't need them anymore.  I hate that argument that these planes, they got the new engines and the new this and all  that.  That's wonderful.  I want something that smells brand new.  JetBlue's got that new fleet, Continental, a lot of new planes in there, a huge fleet 
[00:50:30]  that they have.  American, Delta.  Oh, Delta's ancient.  Fucking Northwest.  Oh.  Have you been on a plane where, like, you could walk into your seat and there's plenty of head  room?  And we're not sure, people.  Yeah.  It's like, how big do they used to make these planes before they started rounding up the  tops and stuff?  You know, I knew there was a problem I got on, and usually you slide that little thing  shut for the window.  This had little curtains. 
[00:51:00]  The little curtains that were shut.  Oof.  Yeah.  Little curtains.  You see, like, a little place where there's pulled off letters and it said, one point at  I said, white only?  Your plane was so old, you were allowed to call them stewardesses.  Hey, sexy stew.  Over here, some champagne, please.  Flight attendants.  Shut up.  I need more coffee.  Exactly.  There's the flight attendants and the gay guy.  Right.  The gay guy and waitresses.  Gay guy with attitude on plane. 
[00:51:30]  Every plane, too.  Why?  Remember it was rare?  It used to be all girls.  And it was very rare you got the guy and went, hey, that guy's a little light in the old  loafers.  And now every flight's got the gay guy and then the women.  I'll tell you one thing.  Here's a rule of thumb.  If you work on a plane and you're not flying it, you like cock.  All right.  Well, we'll get into Anthony's travel mishap after the break. 
[00:52:00]  How's that sound?  Thank you.  And other things we got to get into is the coyote.  What happened to the coyote?  What happened?  When we left, the coyote was fine and dandy.  Well, I hit it.  I told you I had to run in with it.  You did not.  It got physical and apparently there were consequences.  We got to talk about opening day and many other things.  Right.  Yes, I have a couple of topics that I brought to the Opie and Anthony show.  Very good, Jimmy.  I'm hearing something.  I'm hearing a rumor that family guy took your freaking cartoon bit.  Do we have audio of that? 
[00:52:30]  That's what I heard, too.  Or are our people stretching with this?  I thought I read an email that said there was audio.  Do we have audio of that?  I do not know.  What happened?  I just got a thumbs up from Travis in there.  We might have the audio.  Yeah, Danny's got it.  Is it a new bit that they're doing?  It's an old book.  I've never watched family guy in my life.  No, it's just like something they threw in there on Sunday, I guess.  Uh-oh.  I got to tell you, we've been suspicious with family guy for a long time. 
[00:53:00]  You know, it could be paranoid.  Don't want to play that.  We don't want to play the Howie role here, but we've been very suspicious over the years  because when Anthony used to do the Tyson Spelling Bee and all that, it's like, who's  doing Tyson Spelling Bee?  And then they threw it on the Tyson Spelling Bee.  Yeah, it was just a few little things.  There's been a couple other little things.  It's like, oh, that's interesting.  There's sex from Michelob contest.  We all know what that's about.  How bad that went.  And I have to thank the pest for helping me a bit yesterday, and I would like to request 
[00:53:30]  a bit more pest help a bit later.  I am calling out and requesting your assistance.  Wow.  Uh-oh.  All right.  Fat signal.  Also, we've got to talk about what's going on with the pest and Scott Farrell.  Oh.  We'll talk about that.  That is wonderful.  Brutal.  More brutality.  And tonight, we were supposed to start promoting this yesterday, but  Anthony was delayed.  The Rackin' Tours.  Yes.  Jack White's brand new band.  It's basically Jack White, his ex-wife, which make up the White Stripes. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  And they're calling themselves The Cars now.  Oh.  And they're going to be...  No.  Oh, my God.  I got that audio.  And here's our theory.  Yeah.  Coming to life.  We'll get into that, too.  But it's Jack White with his ex-wife, and I guess they added a guitarist, and it's a new  band called The Rackin' Tours.  We're going to be interviewing those guys tonight.  We're going to be at where?  Where the hell are we?  Hawk, you better have an answer.  We're going to be at Hit Factory, and we're going to interview the new band, The Rackin' 
[00:54:30]  Tours, and we're going to also listen to them play.  Oh, I have a little joke.  The Hit Factory sounds like a place they manufacture women who don't listen.  Well, we got some audio from the tonight's show appearance.  Opie and Anthony.  It's great.  I like to have those guys on radio.  Wow, that's really nice.  Really nice.  Opie and Anthony's show on XM Satellite Radio.  It starts with an O&A plug before headlines.  Opie and Anthony's show on XM Radio.  Very nice.  Test tested.  Leno approved.  They plugged us like three times last night. 
[00:55:00]  Yep.  The Opie and Anthony's show.  The Hatter Show.  Saturday, April 8th.  So you're smoking crack at...  Yeah, it was actually underneath the Brooklyn Bridge.  Of course it was.  Opie and Anthony present...  As we all know, when it's time to negotiate with an R-dealer, it's time to whip out your  junk.  For one night only.  There is no black guy's been in space yet.  I believe there was one he blasted him.  The Laszlo Show.  This ain't Little House on the Prairie.  Is this a radio show still?  What is going on here? 
[00:55:30]  Saturday, April 8th, from 8 to 11 Eastern on XM 202.  All right.  How great is that?  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  Back from vacation.  I don't know.  It's like April something, just to prove that we're live.  April 4th, I think?  It is the 4th.  I know it's a two for Tuesday somewhere.  Ooh.  Radio land.  Thank goodness.  I love that promotion.  We just came up with a pretty good idea during the break. 
[00:56:00]  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony program, mustache day.  Mustache day.  We were just goofing on Bill's beard and his ability to grow a beard seemingly overnight.  Intern Bill, yeah, we haven't seen him in just a little over a week.  Yeah.  He came in here with this freaking ridiculous beard and he has.  And he said he grew this in less than a week and he actually trimmed it down.  That's like every beard on the box of those beard trimmers. 
[00:56:30]  Right.  That's like the beard the guy has or the beard coloring, the hair coloring box.  Hi.  To color your beard.  Like that's the type of beard you have.  Yeah, I've basically been in a log cabin upstate New York and I haven't had a chance to shave.  So I just like growing up.  Log cabin upstate, shovel some wine.  What were you doing in the log cabin besides raping someone who was tied up?  Nah, it's our house and I have to take care of it now sometimes.  I have to go up and make sure the snow didn't cave in the roof or anything.  Yeah.  So you do like a Grizzly Adams thing and really don't shave or... 
[00:57:00]  I was chopping firewood.  It was great.  Chopping wood.  So he grew this beard in what, like a week?  Yeah, probably.  It's been about...  Oh, man.  I mean, I got to shave a lot, but I can't get anything like that done in a week.  And he, let me tell you something.  He gets full coverage.  Yeah.  Which is, some people can grow facial hair very quickly, but they're spotty.  It's not, maybe you grow more on the chin than you do the sideburns.  You are completely uniform, a lot of hair, very quick. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, and I try to keep it trimmed too because under, the under part I shave because it gets itchy.  Yeah.  Yeah, if you didn't shave that, that would be like down to your Adam's apple and a lot  of hair.  So we were kind of goofing on it, and how did that come into mustache day?  I don't know.  I just decided that...  Opie just popped into his head that we should do mustache day here.  So we're going to do mustache day.  We've got to figure out a day.  Figure out a day, and then we're just going to grow...  We can grow facial hair however we want.  Right.  But on that one day... 
[00:58:00]  It's going to be really bad to walk around Manhattan with just a mustache.  Yeah, you don't want to do it.  You know how many guys are going to hit on you?  So I...  The mustache is the look of the homo.  Yes, it's called the faggot flag.  Right.  So all these guys out there now, they're like, oh man, I just know I look better with a mustache.  Come on, man.  All these Pittsburgh people who still think fucking big mustaches are hot, you fucking 1971 idiots.  Shave them.  I'm thinking of the Raleigh Fingers. 
[00:58:30]  Look, Mark...  I want that one with the...  I'm going to get some wax.  Mark my word here, though.  We're within a year or two of the mustache coming back strong.  Really?  You just feel it out there.  I've seen a couple of people sporting mustaches.  Because it was all about the goatee, but now it's like...  Yeah.  Like, now the goatee is sort of going away.  Then you've got the soul patch with the mustache.  Yeah.  Or a goatee, but it's shaved way down to just the chin area.  See, that's what I'm looking to do.  I'm looking to get rid of the goatee, but I don't know how to do it.  Mustache day might do it. 
[00:59:00]  I can't wait to see what mustache you walk in with the last time that was seen was in a fucking bunker while chocolate was being eaten.  Finally, you get to wear your favorite look.  All right.  I could wear a Hitler mustache for a day.  Yeah.  If we do mustache day.  Well, it would be boring if we all had just the same mustache.  We need some combos.  No, it wouldn't.  Ball 70s porno.  Snidely Whiplash.  I could have one of those.  Uh-uh.  I don't think I could grow something that long, though.  That would take a long time. 
[00:59:30]  So anyone could grow, like, full beard, goatee, whatever.  But on that one day, only mustache.  We have to come in with only mustache.  I know we must must.  The way I grow facial hair.  I see stubble on you, though.  For it to be a mustache.  Or, as I say, a mustache.  Mustache.  For it to be a mustache.  The mustachio Jim Norton came in.  And then we'll get the listeners involved, too.  But you've got to do it before and after.  Because if you're just a guy that has a mustache, who cares?  That's stupid.  With some of the more popular fans of the show that we all know and love and seen their 
[01:00:00]  pictures a lot, it would be kind of fun if they did it.  I might want to do the one that comes over and then down.  That's the one I want to do.  You're going to do, like, almost a Fu Manchu without any chin hair?  Because I did that as a goof.  What was it?  Like, not this New Year's, but last New Year's.  Yeah, the Lemmy.  But is that truly a mustache?  Because he's got the sideburns connecting to the mustache.  So I don't think the Lemmy is legal.  See, I like just a shitty, fat mustache.  Big, fat, 70s porno mustache.  Because a mustache that you're talking about, with the little side things, could actually 
[01:00:30]  look kind of like a goatee and look cool.  Pop up John Holmes or who's the other porn star?  Fucking Dave Wanstead.  Get Harry Wanstead.  Exactly.  Get one of those porno stars, because I want to see that mustache.  I might fashion my mustache after one of the famed 70s porn stars.  Why do you think you want to grow a mustache?  What do you think facial hair will do?  Shut up.  Your mother didn't love you.  Useless piece of crap.  You know what, though?  Show slower down her.  They're finally acknowledging that she stinks, though. 
[01:01:00]  She's barely on.  She's cameos.  She's barely on now.  She was on for what?  I don't even think she was on this past episode, right?  Hard on at all.  Two seconds.  They finally realized that that is just a buzzkill.  Smart move by Adriana to fucking go to the wish on Joey.  She made a couple seasons, though, out of it.  Oh, dude, she made a bunch.  She had a great...  Maybe they were done with the character.  Oh, I thought you were being sarcastic.  Because I think Joey's canceled, and now she's out of work.  Well, no, no.  I was being sarcastic.  That was a bad move to leave the Sopranos, but they might have been her out. 
[01:01:30]  Was that John Holmes?  Yeah, that's a John Holmes.  When he was arrested.  What a big, huge 70s.  74, wow.  He's got that porno mustache working.  God.  Yeah.  That's great.  See?  I don't think I could grow that.  Then again, when you're John Holmes, every time you went to shave, you're in the mirror,  you probably just looked down and saw your cock and got distracted.  That half.  Look at the size of that.  Why shave?  I could just hold this.  Let's go to Keith in Connecticut.  Keith.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  I wanted to know his intern, Bill, with his beard, if he looked like Rocky when he was  training to fight the Russian when he was splitting wood. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  When he makes that really good speech at the end, what a cheesedick he is.  He did have that more, I think more, if you want to stick with the Sly Stallone, more  from Cobra.  I think he's got that kind of beard and mustache going.  When he was marrying Cabretti, the line, you're the disease and I'm the cure.  I'm the cure.  And they called him Cobra, and his last name was Cabretti, so it made sense.  It wasn't just like they picked a cool name out. 
[01:02:30]  It would be like addressing him in real life and going, hey, douchebaggy, fucking cheese  dick.  How did anybody ever enjoy him after Rocky 2?  Rocky 3, okay.  Rocky 3.  Come on.  I enjoyed that.  Rocky 3 was fun.  Come on, fool.  But just what a corny name.  Yeah.  Apollo Creed.  Clubber Lang.  Fucking, he fights the AIDS guy in the street in five.  The AIDS guy.  Tommy Morrison.  Is that how it was billed?  Yes.  Rocky fights the AIDS guy.  That's right.  That's wonderful. 
[01:03:00]  All right.  Rocky dipped his gloves in AZT and won the dramatic who gives a shit knockout.  Yuck.  He gets a mouthpiece in bleach every between rounds.  So, Anthony, how was your vacation?  I had such a wonderful cruise.  Opie, I cruised the seas on the adventure of the sea, of the seas, Royal Caribbean, out  of Puerto Rico, and then from Puerto Rico, went to Aruba, and then CuraÃ§ao, and then 
[01:03:30]  up to St. Martin and St. Thomas, and then back to Puerto Rico.  So, you're a couple of days, you know, at sea, just kind of cruising around, and then you  get on the island, you get to the beach, a lot of drinks, things like that.  At night, it's all about the lovely dinners in the three-deck, huge dining rooms.  People take care of you amazingly.  And then, you go to the casino, you gamble, make some friends.  Do you feel crowded on the boat? 
[01:04:00]  I've never taken.  They are so ridiculously huge these days.  The cabins now, on the adventure, which isn't even the new one, they got this new freedom  class of ship coming out that is, it's ridiculous big, where it makes all, it dwarfs other cruise  ships.  The ones that are out there now, huge.  And every room now, they used to have, like, some really shitty rooms, bottom, like lower  decks, deck three, where you'd have a little porthole. 
[01:04:30]  Now, every friggin' room has a balcony, so you could get outside now.  They figured that out.  This one adventure has got this big, like, Broadway running through the middle of it, with  stores and shops, big vaulted ceiling that goes up 100 feet.  Do you forget you're on a boat?  Yeah, a lot of times, it's a huge luxury hotel.  The hallways now, it used to be older cruise ships, the hallways, when you're getting to  your cabin, were kind of thin. 
[01:05:00]  Now, they've widened those out.  They've made, you know, he's got a couple of things.  It's an amazing, lavish, very classy ship.  First class in the ship?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  There are different classes of cabins.  You know, there's the owner's suite, and then there's the royal suite.  What's an owner's suite?  Owner's suite is what I had.  There's like 10 of them on the whole ship.  And they're, of course, they're like big.  They're very good.  They got widescreen TVs in them, a lot of room, big balconies. 
[01:05:30]  This is fun.  Showers, jacuzzis.  This is definitely fun for the faithful listeners to see how we have grown in our careers.  But it's, I have the most fun with this, I have to tell you.  Come on.  You saw me with my Dodge Ares K car at Spooky World in Boston when we left after the gig,  and Opie thought my car was an abandoned car in the woods.  I had parked.  Spooky World was so packed that day that I had to park in the woods, kind of.  And we were kind of late, so I ran. 
[01:06:00]  That kind of.  You know how you make your own spots at events and sporting events or what have you.  So I made it kind of in the woods, which was fine by me.  The parking lot was packed, but we stayed so late, we're kind of hanging out, having  a good time, that by the time we left, all the cars were gone, except for mine, Opie's,  and maybe two more.  So I start walking over to my car.  He goes, where are you going?  I go, my car.  He goes, dude, I thought that was an abandoned car in the fucking woods.  It was an old, rusted Dodge Ares K car.  I just can't believe Anthony stayed for something.  After, like, it was over, you didn't get out a minute later? 
[01:06:30]  That was the old days.  Wow.  Although I got to tell you, on this vacation, I pretty much did everything I hadn't done  in years.  There was eating poorly, drinking like crazy.  The only thing I didn't do was smoke.  Oh, shut up your ass.  It was smoke.  How do you know what I was going to say?  I barely said anything.  I heard enough.  All right.  But this is mostly fun for me, I have to admit. 
[01:07:00]  So the owner's suite is like the best one.  Is that better than the other one?  No, there's a royal suite that I tried to book, but the thing is booked up three years  in advance.  What?  It has a piano in it.  Oh, for what?  What do you need that for?  Because it's a digital piano.  You put it in and it plays like you don't even need a piano player.  Exactly.  You don't need a piano either.  And you hold parties.  It looks like a ghost is playing.  Yeah.  The keys actually go down.  You hold parties?  What, just you alone?  I have my entire family there.  With the piano?  Sir, and then you hold a party in your room. 
[01:07:30]  You have it catered by the ship, and they bring in lovely hors d'oeuvres and things and  drinks, and you come in, and there's a bar in your room and everything.  How many people are on the ship?  On the ship?  50.  Probably about three, between 3,000, 3,500.  Wow.  And there's enough room for all those people.  Dude, you don't even understand how big this thing is.  I'm such a newbie with this crap.  Take the ship, stand it up on its end. 
[01:08:00]  It's like the Chrysler building.  It's ridiculous.  It's huge.  Every port we'd pull into, all the other ships were dwarfed.  We've got rock climbing walls.  The new ship has a surf, you could surf and boogie board on the back of the ship.  There's an actual pool that makes a wave that you surf on.  It's giant.  Wait a minute.  Multiple pools.  Oh, on the ship.  Yeah, on the ocean.  No, you're not in the ocean.  They just fling you overboard. 
[01:08:30]  It's great.  And dinner is another thing.  They have formal night.  Two nights out of the seven are formal night where you all dress in gowns and tuxedos.  Preferably tuxes if you're a guy, gowns if you're a girl.  Right.  I guess that's open to suggestions.  Two tuxes if you're a lesbian couple.  Right.  A couple of dykes.  And it's formal night and it's so luxurious.  Everything was good.  I had, as an appetizer one night, something that was nothing more than what amounted to beef bullion. 
[01:09:00]  You ever take a beef cube and put it in boiling water when you were starving in college and eat that?  It was luxurious.  It was the best broth I ever had.  Yeah, that's, look at that.  That's the boogie boarding thing that is on one of the ships.  So, wait, you had, uh, your appetizer was Robert Reed's last meal.  That's nice.  They had you a curled up tissue and a tear catcher.  We all, it was robe night. 
[01:09:30]  Now, let me ask you, do you, uh, now when you're in first class or as you're in, you know, like fucking somewhere between Elton John and fucking the Queen's class,  do they, uh, give you different food or do you have the same food?  You have the same food because it's, uh, all, uh, in the same dining rooms.  There are three tiers of dining rooms.  It's huge, but very luxurious and everybody is treated like a king in the dining room.  Is your room big?  Did you have a jacuzzi in your room?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cool.  Room was pretty big. 
[01:10:00]  King bed?  Uh, yeah.  Was your room bigger than this studio?  Um, yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Was it as big as this office?  Pretty big.  No, not as big as the office.  You're on a ship, for God's sake.  They gotta fit in a lot of people.  What kind of pillows?  Do they have feather pillows?  Yeah, feather pillows.  Ooh.  Uh, when you first get on, you have to do the, um, the, uh, life drill where you get your life jackets  and gotta stand out there on the deck with everybody.  It's a pain in the ass.  You do that, and then once you do that, you're free to do whatever the hell you want on the boat. 
[01:10:30]  And it's great.  And, uh, like I said, dinner.  You grease enough for the guys that come over.  And I guess that's where you're talking about different classes if the, the people eat better than the other.  You slip some money to these people, you get anything you want.  They bring you more of this, more of that, champagne, some Dom Perignon, 300 bottles of, dollar bottles of wine.  It just, it's great.  At the meal or in your cabin?  Cantaloupe.  They bring you the sliced cantaloupe.  It's wonderful. 
[01:11:00]  And prosciutto.  It's amazing.  Uh, yeah, you just gotta grease them a little bit.  But can you get room service 24 hours?  Yeah.  Room service 24 hours.  You have your personal stateroom attendant that makes the cute little, you come back all hammered from the casino.  It's three in the morning.  You walk in, and there's a towel monkey swinging from, uh, a hanger, uh, wearing your sunglasses.  They make little animals.  One day we come in, what's on the bed?  It's a penguin with two chocolates on his head for us. 
[01:11:30]  Ha ha ha.  I like it.  Eric's laughing.  He was just on a cruise, though.  That's what they do.  They make little things.  They make it fun.  Anthony.  It's fun, and they treat you like kings.  Where's Sean Jocks?  You shouldn't be admitting that there's a penguin towel on your bisexual bird.  It's wonderful.  One day he made a scary bat.  It was wonderful.  It was very funny.  What happened to you?  It's, it, they treat you.  I mean, from two weeks ago, what happened to you?  Really?  They treat you like king.  It's, it's wonderful.  And then, um... 
[01:12:00]  I think he went to the University of Faggot while we were gone.  No, no.  And it was great that they make the towel into a cock and you can bend over and sit on it.  It doesn't even break.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  It's a lot of fun.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  It's a wonderful time.  They give you your own slave.  That's what you get on that fucking thing.  It's like a belly warmer.  They pretty much do.  Yeah, it's a black guy with his arm out and a little towel hanging on.  Well, they are very dark people that work, uh, the ships and, uh, all the ports.  Were they nice to you, though?  They are amazing. 
[01:12:30]  Anything you want.  Because when you go down the Caribbean, uh, they're not as nice.  No.  There's a little, uh, racist thing going on.  No.  They don't want to serve you.  Nope.  This is fantastic.  They, they, they treat you like royalty.  They really do.  And, uh, I had, I had my laptop with me and, uh, camera.  And I have internet access in the middle of the ocean.  High speed.  It's wonderful.  High speed on the Wi-Fi, which is, uh, certain areas of the ship.  In your stateroom, it's dial-up.  Okay.  But it was good enough for me to get online a few times. 
[01:13:00]  And I went to the Wi-Fi area up on the main, like, there's the 14th floor.  On the 14th floor.  Jesus.  Overlooks.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  Overlooks the entire front of the ship or the midship where the pool area is and everything.  So I'm sitting up there having a drink.  And, uh, I log on Wi-Fi.  I got the camera.  I go on to Pal Talk.  And, of course, Opie and Anthony room, there's constantly at least 200, 250 people in it.  Uh, so I log on. 
[01:13:30]  And I'm kind of panning the room.  And they're all making jokes because, uh, one of the waiter comes over.  And they just start saying, I had to turn the volume down.  Ramon, get Anthony a drink.  He's a fancy man.  Hey, colored gentlemen, why aren't you moving faster?  I'm, like, hitting the volume button.  And the guy's like, oh, what is this you're, uh, watching of?  I go, oh.  And I put the camera right in his face.  And they're like, who's the monkey giving you a drink?  Just awful racist Pal Talk people. 
[01:14:00]  Why did they write these things about me?  Why?  Why?  They write these things.  Why did they call me Mikey?  No, no, no.  No, no.  It's a bad speller.  Right, right, right.  But I had the camera there, so they were watching.  And I took them on a tour of the boat.  Uh, I looked like a lunatic because I'm carrying around my laptop and a camera.  And I'm walking through the hallways.  And I got lost a couple times.  And one said, heavy machinery, do not enter.  And they're taunting me to go in the room.  And then I'm just kind of walking around. 
[01:14:30]  And, uh, I would pass, uh.  They were playing a video game with you.  Yeah, some guy said, he goes, dude, this is like playing Doom.  I'm just walking around.  And you see a hot chick laying down.  And I kind of focus on that and have to leave.  And people go, no, put it back.  And I said, I can't hover over a girl with a camera.  Hi, what's your name?  Uh, so I just kept walking.  Gave them a little tour.  And, uh, until the Wi-Fi ran out.  But, um, they enjoyed it.  It was a little tour of the ship.  And it was a lot of fun.  Uh, after that, it's pretty much beach. 
[01:15:00]  A lot of laying down on the beach.  A lot of drinks with rum and, uh, banana.  I had something called a banana bye-bye.  It's like a banana daiquiri with, uh, Baileys in it.  And bye-bye.  You drink a couple of them.  Boof!  You're out!  Was that the faggiest drink you've ever had?  No, I was drinking some kind of champagne and peach schnapps thing at the champagne bar.  It was the faggiest drink I ever had.  What was it?  Here's how they pour it. 
[01:15:30]  A guy actually stands over and yanks it out of his cock.  He stores it in his balls.  But in a very classy way.  What was the name of the faggiest, faggiest drink you've ever drank?  Wow, faggiest drink.  Because you just reminded me of something.  I don't know if I've told this story on the air and I'll have to throw myself under the bus.  Mmm.  Wonderful.  What was your, the name of the faggiest drink you've ever drank in your life?  Cum.  The cumatini?  Yeah, it was some type of, uh, martini. 
[01:16:00]  Well, mine is a tini.  I had some kind of chocolate martini, but it was named something else I can't remember, but very faggity.  Yeah.  Well, uh, you don't remember the name, though?  No.  Oh, my God.  Well, last summer I went on vacation with, um, Lindsay's family, Outer Banks, North Carolina.  Just rent a house on the beach.  You have to, like, four-wheel in on the, on the beach, like, for miles just to get to your house.  And, uh, I'm very nervous.  Very nervous going on vacation with, uh, with Lindsay and her family.  Yeah.  Because, uh, we didn't spend that much quality time together in the beginning of the relationship. 
[01:16:30]  They had to accept me for who I was.  Of course.  And they finally did, which is great.  We all get along now.  But, uh, down there in, uh, the Outer Banks, we go out to dinner.  And it's literally the first time, I think, that we all sat down for a dinner.  So my nerves are just, just out of control.  What's the note?  Sea breeze, like Howie.  Thank you, uh, thank you, Iraq. 
[01:17:00]  That really helped the discussion.  The note I was just, the note I was just, oh, he was in such a good mood.  Oh.  How quick did that, how, how long did your vacation last, Iraq?  It's like, that tan turned to red.  He's back in the shitter.  Yeah, you made it an hour and a half for Iraq.  What could I tell you?  I was talking about the cruise.  He, he was on one, so he's like, yeah, I got a little penguin in my room, too. 
[01:17:30]  Two minutes later, he's a piece of shit.  He, he, he was walking around all morning just whistling.  He had a nice tan, a smile on his face.  Yeah, that lasted an hour and a half.  Oh, God.  They're just shaking their heads in the other room.  It was just, it was an odd, it was an odd thing to do just because of the placement.  If you can't see in the studio, the Iraq actually just walked behind open, kind of hand.  It was just an odd, uh, you know, moment to do it.  Did I order my coffee, by the way? 
[01:18:00]  I forgot.  I bring nothing to the table.  Oh.  Can I get a, uh, can I get a 2% dry cappuccino, please?  Grande?  All right, that's the fag.  I was just going to say.  No, no, no, no, no.  So, so, um, we all went out to dinner and we were kind of like breaking bread, you know,  finally, like, it was our first, uh, dinner together.  It was, uh, it was Lindsay and I and our two brothers, uh, who I forgot to wish a happy  birthday before we went on break.  AJ and, uh, and Kenny. 
[01:18:30]  Sorry.  That would have cost you.  Yeah.  What?  You forgot the name?  Huh?  Forget the name?  No, no, I just, no, I just felt bad that I, uh, forgot to wish them a happy birthday before  we went on break.  I promised them I would.  They're huge fans of the show.  And so we're sitting there and then it's like Lindsay's, uh, uh, uncle and his family.  So it's a, it's a big deal.  We're sitting down.  Right.  And it's time for the drink water.  Right.  And Lindsay's father, you know, he's, he's a man's man.  God damn it.  He's a man's man.  Scotch whiskey.  It's all about beer, beer, and more beer. 
[01:19:00]  A man's man.  And I'm looking at the, uh, the, uh, the drink menu, not even, not even thinking, not even  thinking.  Right.  And, uh, all of a sudden it's, uh, it's like, uh, beer, beer, beer, beer around the table.  Right.  All the, all the men are drinking beer and it comes to me and I, I'm not even really listening  that they all just ordered beer.  And I go, I'll have a bikini teeny.  Yeah. 
[01:19:30]  Lindsay like does a double take, looks at me like, are you fucking crazy?  Way to break the, of the New York faggot image.  They probably had.  I wish I knew how to quit you.  It looked, it looked, it looked, it looked, it looked delicious on the drink menu.  It had everything I like.  You don't drink it.  They just bend you over and splash it on your back.  And it came in a faggoty glass and the color was just fagg, everything just said faggoty. 
[01:20:00]  We have some, uh, audio from the waiter.  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  The last time I'm going to ask you, you ever suck a guy's cock?  Show me with your mouth.  Show me with your mouth.  And, uh, here's a suggestion, I guess, from the waiter on the ways you can have the drink.  You can get a doggy style, you can get a lean on your side.  Those are your only choices.  This is my house and I get the same.  But it's like, why?  Why couldn't I just say beer?  I like beer. 
[01:20:30]  I enjoy beer.  You didn't have to go to the bikini-tini.  When I'm looking at the drink menu, you're not even thinking, like, wow, look at all the fruit juices it has in it.  And it has rum.  Two different kinds of rum.  Dark rum and regular rum.  Do you want to kiss me?  Can I kiss you on the mouth?  So, around the table, beer, beer, beer, beer.  I'll have a bikini-tini.  So cute.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Can I bring you a bikini-tini? 
[01:21:00]  Shows up with a nice piece of fruit over the faggot-y glass.  Of course it does.  His name was Brad.  And a cute straw and a stupid kind of umbrella thing.  They're all drinking their beers and I'm, like, sipping on my bikini-tini.  And I could see it in Lindsey's father's face, like, the disappointment.  The disappointment.  Well, I won't be getting any grandkids.  The disappointment.  The disappointment.  And Lindsey's giving me a double take.  Like, you decide now to have a bikini-tini. 
[01:21:30]  A bikini-tini.  Just when things are going great.  You could seal the deal by just getting a beer and clinking glasses and you get this  fucking drink.  A cuter stein.  So then, so now I'm just in a pure panic and it's time for another, you know, round.  And now I just go complete opposite way.  I'm like, oh.  Heroin.  I'll have a schlitz in a can.  Oh, there you go.  And then, I'm not even kidding.  I went from bikini-tini to schlitz in a can and now Lindsey's like, are you feeling okay?  What the hell?  You know, I'm sweating. 
[01:22:00]  I'm like.  One extreme to the other there.  Because I'm trying to make a good impression.  Now you're trying to compensate.  So now I'm drinking schlitz in a can.  The worst thing about any kind of martini, which there are 8,000 of now, used to just  be the martini.  Now it's very in to have some kind of a chocolate martini, other kind of martini.  Right.  Lemon top martini.  Key lime martini.  Key lime pie martini.  Right.  Sorry.  Can it please be put in a glass that isn't what amounts to a plate on a stem?  It is the hardest fucking drink not to spill all over yourself. 
[01:22:30]  What's the degree?  It's like a, it's like 170 degrees of angle on the glass and you're trying to hold it.  And, you know, usually you have to be a drunk to drink these things.  Right.  It's spilling.  So your stability is not too good to begin with.  Try it on a ship that's lurching a little bit.  I'm walking with my chocolate martini.  My hand is soaked.  Wait, you can feel the ship moving? 
[01:23:00]  A little bit.  Some days.  Some nights.  A little bit.  Do you get seasick?  No.  I used to, but it doesn't move like a boat moving.  Like if I, if I go on somebody's 35 footer, something like that, and the water gets rough,  I'll be a puking motherfucker.  But on one of these ships, it just feels kind of like the ground's moving a little bit.  It doesn't, you don't get that.  Whoa.  Do they sell Dramamine on the boat?  They have to.  Oh yeah, everything you need.  And if Dramamine ain't good enough, you go down to sickbay, they'll give you some kind 
[01:23:30]  of anti-psychotic that cuts off all kinds of things to your brain that'll make you seasick.  But no one gets, more people get sick from drinking than they do seasick.  It's, they have all kinds of stabilizers on these things that are amazing.  I want to take a closer look.  The water can be really rough.  You know, they don't even have like, like the old days, the older days.  They used to have propellers coming out the back with propeller shafts.  And to make the boat vibrate, now they got electric pods, four of them, on the bottom of these boats. 
[01:24:00]  With GPS, they never have to drop anchor.  They could sit in one spot in the water, just with these pods on the bottom of the ship that  turn 180 degrees.  They're a whole like special on the boat.  You could sit there and watch it.  It's amazing.  Just amazing technology.  I want to take a cruise.  You would love it.  It's so relaxing.  You love the luxurious hotels and stuff, right?  The fancy hotels.  And the best part of it, you go to, let's say you're on Aruba. 
[01:24:30]  You don't want to stay there.  Like, if you're on Aruba for a week, you might run out of things to do.  You know, you get a little bored with the atmosphere.  You're going to the same beach, things like that.  By the time you're done, you're on your ship.  Your hotel now takes you to some other beach.  You go to sleep.  You wake up.  Hey, I'm in St. Thomas.  You go to the beach there.  You do the things there.  You come back.  You gamble.  You do whatever.  You go to sleep.  You wake up.  Hey, you're somewhere else. 
[01:25:00]  It's kind of great, you know?  You get a little varied atmospheres.  And it's all luxury.  I like luxury.  Luxury rocks.  This guy from Chicago says he was on the same ship as you.  Oh!  Guy from Chicago.  Couple of fans on the boat.  Hey there.  Pally, how you doing?  All right.  Were you the guy that kept wanting to take a picture but didn't have a camera?  That's me.  How awkward is it?  What's that?  Hey, you know how awkward that is? 
[01:25:30]  Hey, man.  Can I take a picture?  Yes, you are.  I don't know the camera.  All right.  I'll see you amongst the 3,500 people.  That was my wife's job to have it.  That's all right.  I will say there was a group of us sitting at the bar.  We did see you carrying your chocolate martini in your tuxedo.  Yes, I was in my tux carrying my chocolate martini.  You really had a tuxedo?  On formal night?  Yes, he did.  He brought it with you?  No.  I was the only one that knew who he was.  So here are my buddies.  They're saying, look at this guy with the chocolate.  They saw you put your bet down on the roulette table, lose, get pissed, and grab a chocolate 
[01:26:00]  martini.  Wait, which bet was that?  I didn't bet roulette.  I was playing hold'em.  Oh, I did play roulette.  You made one bet.  You leaned over.  You looked.  You were uncertain.  You threw it down real quick and walked away.  Yeah, I was waiting for the hold'em table to open up.  That's right.  And it wasn't open.  So I threw a bet on black and it came in red.  But what time can you gamble until there?  Three in the morning.  Three.  When they closed down.  A lot of hold'em.  Playing a lot of hold'em.  It was that or three card folks.  It was a hard table to get on. 
[01:26:30]  Well, did you get your picture with Ant?  I got it.  All right.  Where do you get your tuxedo from?  You rent it on the boat.  The tailor comes to your room and measures you.  And then the next day, hanging in your closet is a lovely tuxedo.  How much is it to rent it?  I don't know.  I think it's 90 bucks for two days.  Okay, that's not bad.  That's not bad at all.  Less than I paid, 200.  And you get two shirts, so you're not wearing the same shirt and socks.  Can you smoke everywhere or no?  How much was that?  There are designated smoking areas on the boat. 
[01:27:00]  Okay.  And there's enough of them where smokers aren't pissed off.  And then the islands, you know, they don't care where you smoke on those savage islands.  They don't care.  How long are you on the islands for?  Anywhere.  Some days you'll dock at 8 in the morning and the ship will leave at 6 at night.  So you have the entire day there.  Others, like Arubu, we were there from early in the morning, like 8 in the morning until 1 in the morning.  Like the next morning.  So it's like all day and all night. 
[01:27:30]  Did you look for her?  Went to the bar.  Went to Carlos and Charlie's.  Yeah.  Hung out there.  Had some, what the hell was I drinking there?  I think banana daiquiris.  Drinking there.  But that place is just a madhouse of rape waiting to happen.  Dude.  It's all it is.  There's an upper balcony where me, my friend Buddy, we're hanging out looking over the edge of this balcony at just future rapes on the floor. 
[01:28:00]  One girl, some drunk blonde with half her shirt hanging off, drinking her hand, woo, doing the woo dance with her arms up in the air with five guys around her.  Not the woo dance.  Humping her ass.  Not the woo dance.  Doing the ass hump dance.  But there are five of them.  And they're all trying to vie for any attention.  So the second, like, she made eye contact with one, the one would be with the other ones like, hey, she wants me, motherfuckers.  And they'd have to, like, go off and try to find another rape victim. 
[01:28:30]  You just know there's just rape going on down there.  Drunk woo girls.  It was different.  Woo!  All right, Chicago.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Hey, speaking of woo girls, while we're on break, I know we're all over the place because we're so excited to be back.  We just love doing radio because I'm thinking we're just, like, here and there.  We haven't even explained why we didn't do a show yesterday.  But speaking of woo girls, something that happened while we're on break, a lot of controversy over the woo girls' websites. 
[01:29:00]  I don't know what they're officially called.  Steve, that's where we need the expert.  We need Steve from FoundryMusic.com to come in.  Sluts.  There's these websites where, you know, when, like, the girls, you know, pass out drunk and stuff and you take their picture.  Free meat.  We've seen them.  We've seen the girl that has passed out on the couch with the puke next door that looks like cookie soup.  That's a great one, yeah.  And the girls, like, you know, kind of almost passed out sitting on the sidewalk and they didn't wear, you know, panties that day. 
[01:29:30]  Underwear.  So you see up the skirt.  So you see the up the skirt shots.  They're very popular websites.  Very.  And I guess they're trying to get them shut down.  Who is?  Yeah, the women's groups.  Who can try to get them shut down?  How can you?  I don't have the story in front of me.  Maybe one of our guys could get the story.  It happened while we were on break.  But it's the woo girls' websites, basically.  And they're very popular.  They're all over the place.  They get crazy hits.  It is very hard.  Somehow they're trying to get these websites shut down.  Because they end up on not exclusive websites, you know, websites exclusive to that. 
[01:30:00]  It's not upskirts.com.  Upskirts are fucking, that's a whole other phenomenon.  These are.  Put, without any filter on your Google, put nude drunk chicks.  And you'll just come up with a bevy.  But no, no, no.  Put the adult filter on.  That will take out all the bad ones.  Yeah, you wouldn't want that.  Stupid adult filter.  I'm the king of keywords.  Here it is.  Google keywords.  No, images, my friend.  Images.  Well, no.  Well, just go.  All right. 
[01:30:30]  Well, go back, though.  Because there was a great website.  The one I was thinking of.  Drunkchick.com.  Chick, spelled with an X.  All right.  Here it is.  See?  Steve, what's a, did you hear about this while we were on break?  The drunk chick website.  That looks too commercial.  This is too commercial.  Yeah, back up and go to images.  And look around.  You'll see, like, drunk chicks.  See, these are more, more like.  Like, porno type sites.  Just put drunk chicks, then.  Take out nude. 
[01:31:00]  Google's great.  Drunk chicks.  And it's just girls just doing what they do best when they're drunk.  And guys have, you know, you have the cell phones everywhere now.  So you're getting the pictures.  Yeah.  They're showing it up on these websites.  And there was a huge outrage.  And I wish we had the news story and the audio.  Maybe we can find it.  I'll report.  All right.  I actually know the site.  It's galswhoarebehavinginatipsyfashion.com.  Well, we got some images that are up.  But, uh...  A lot of those websites are fake.  Oh, oh.  Well, I can't hear you. 
[01:31:30]  Sorry.  A lot of those websites are fake.  So, I mean, I don't know if they're...  Well, you can tell the ones that aren't, though.  Right, right.  No, I would understand where their concern would be if you were, you know, legitimately getting  a girl, you know, drunk and then taking her picture doing something she shouldn't  be doing.  Right.  That's one thing.  But a lot of these...  A lot of the websites that are out there featuring, quote, unquote, drunk chicks are fake.  Grr.  Grr.  Well, they're trying to get them shut down.  It was a huge story all around.  Yes, they are.  But, um...  Maybe someone has more info and they could, uh, you know, send the story a little bit.  Oh, there he goes.  Ow! 
[01:32:00]  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  I want to set that as my ringtone.  Love it.  I have a new phone.  I don't know how to set ringtones, but darn it, I want to set that as a ringtone.  All right, let's say hi to Tim in Texas.  Tim, what's up?  Hey, Tim.  Tim!  I didn't push it.  Let's try it again.  Uh, Tim?  Yeah.  Hi, Tim.  There you are.  What's up?  How are you guys doing?  All right.  It's good to be back.  I just wanted to call in and share my shame of ordering a faggy drink. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, see, I'm not alone.  I hate when I freaking admit this shit and no one comes to the table.  No, I went out with my, uh, my wife's family.  Same type of thing.  Everybody's getting man drinks and shit.  And I ordered an Oasis Daydreamer.  Oasis Daydreamer.  I'll have an Oasis Daydreamer.  It's fucking pink.  See, here's the problem.  I just feel like it clear.  Here's the problem.  That's all I got, guys.  But here's the problem with the faggy drinks. 
[01:33:00]  Like, you look at the drink menu and it just looks...  Tasty beverage.  It looks delicious.  Yes.  There should be another way to be able to order the drink.  Call it a number two.  Call it a number three.  Well, the Choggle Martini is the number two.  That's why we get the big bucks.  We're so smart.  I actually, um, refuse to say funny names like that.  I refuse.  Like, when you're...  I, honest to God, will not say the name.  Like, let me have that one.  I'll point.  On the board.  Because, like, the other...  The Waka Daka Chocolate Cake.  I refuse.  Yeah, go fuck yourself. 
[01:33:30]  I've not ordered stuff that I've wanted because of the name.  Point at it.  Dude, I go this.  I go the Waka Daka.  I go this.  Right here.  This.  I refuse to say it.  This.  And it's not out of being masculine.  It's out of stop trying to be fucking funny on your menus, motherfuckers.  But stop trying to make me laugh and be different.  That's a funny name.  The Waka Waka.  Yeah.  The Waka Daka Chocolate Cake.  Would you like some Waka Daka Chocolate Cake?  No, I wouldn't.  I'd like that item and your wrist cut.  And then the Waka Daka mascot has to come over and wish you a happy birthday. 
[01:34:00]  Happy, happy birthday.  Clap, clap.  Yeah.  You know, we're kind of on to something now.  Because it does go way past the gay drinks.  But you should be able to order the faggy drinks another way.  Like, call it a number.  Just call it a number.  A number eight.  Color code it.  Give me a green.  Give me a red.  If you want a number eight, that means you don't want the faggy display either.  You want it in a glass that's not see-through and make it look like it's just a vodka. 
[01:34:30]  A lot of it is part of the club's atmosphere.  They don't want to do it.  The uniform.  It's like the Captain Hook uniform.  You know.  The people want to see you deliver that fish in the Captain Hook uniform.  Right.  Have some pride.  Put your faggots with a cake and sparkles on it.  Happy, happy birthday.  Is it?  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy.  A bunch of queers and fat chicks.  This guy went to a gay steakhouse by mistake. 
[01:35:00]  Bill.  What?  There's no such thing as a gay steakhouse.  No, it's not.  They only serve the asshole of the bowl.  Oh.  Lying.  Hello?  Yes, sir.  Yes.  I moved to Atlanta, and these guys told me there was a, and this is before any brokeback  time, there's a gay steakhouse in Atlanta called Cow Tippers.  Yeah.  I go in there.  My buddy and I go in early on a Saturday night, not knowing anything about it other  than it's supposed to have good steaks.  So I said, hey, we're in Atlanta.  I'll order the peach margarita in the big fish bowl. 
[01:35:30]  So we're sitting there eating steaks.  I start looking around.  Next thing you know, it's like all guys.  Gay steakhouse.  And here I am with his big meat.  How could there be meat on the bone in the gay steakhouse?  Yeah, nice.  On the bone.  There was a drink at some bar here in New York years ago.  I can't remember the name of it or anything, but it was served in a goldfish bowl, and  it was some blue drink.  It had some blue corso in it, and the gag, the gimmick was there was a plastic shark, and 
[01:36:00]  they filled the shark up with grenadine, and then stuck it in upside down.  So as you're drinking it, the shark slowly bled from the mouth.  It was the grenadine coming out of this blue drink.  And you looked so stupid walking around this big goldfish bowl with a toy shark in it.  No, you looked stupid.  I looked stupid.  So why don't you tell the whole story?  I meant you as, you know.  You.  You being me. 
[01:36:30]  No, you as in you.  You're right.  I did.  I felt very stupid.  But again, very tasty drink.  Looked really ridiculous.  You know what I got?  That was a really weird drink.  Coffee.  Get me a fucking coffee, please.  Perhaps a green tea.  You know, going out to a bar with your friends is about having fun, and sometimes it involves  silly drinks.  Seltzer and lime.  That's a goofy drink.  Seltzer and lime.  That's what I want.  Perhaps a dyed Coke.  Well, we all know the fuzzy navel is...  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:37:00]  That's not really a gay drink, though, because it's like...  It's just a known gay drink.  You picture a hot chick.  Fuzzy navel.  You know, it's a fuzzy navel.  Well, a lot of the drinks, somebody's saying, is to get the chicks drunk with.  That's what the fag drinks are for.  But they happen to be tasty.  And especially if you're on something like a cruise, it's all about sweet drinks.  Banana things, strawberry daiquiris, things like that.  Go ahead. 
[01:37:30]  Fucking Denny's.  And you know, it's not a drink, it's a food.  Moon's over my hammy.  Now, what is wrong with a funny name like that?  I wouldn't know, because I would point and go, I'd like this, please.  Which one?  The moon...  This.  The moon's over my hammy.  There's Hammond.  Right, and the moon's with the eggs.  Hey, that's my drink.  You drank that?  Yeah.  That's worse than a Bikini Tini, my friend.  It certainly is.  What a mo.  That is a faggot-ass drink, man. 
[01:38:00]  It's got an umbrella, a shark, there's palm trees on it.  It's awful.  Natalie Holloway floating underneath it.  Yeah, do they have that drink yet?  No, they're very sensitive to that in the area.  Are they?  They really don't like the jokes about it or anything.  Yeah.  Well, how many of them are flying around?  A lot of people are just joking all the time on the island?  Yeah, as a matter of fact, the tourists are always making fun of, you know,  hey, did you see it?  I found her under a rock.  Trying to make some kind of light of it.  We don't think that's funny here, man. 
[01:38:30]  Not funny.  Even though we did it.  Let's go to Crotch Critter.  Crotch Critter.  Yeah, hey, how's it going, y'all?  Hey.  Okay, I got a faggot drink story for you.  I'm down in a bar.  It's a country-western bar down in Louisiana.  A huge place.  Not even there anymore.  Anyway, they've got this, their, you know, famous drink.  It's called the Leg Splitter.  What you do is, you know, it comes in like a glass.  It's all green and everything.  Well, I go up.  I'm with my girl and a couple other people.  I go up to the bar. 
[01:39:00]  Mind you, it's a country and western bar.  So everybody's, you know, there in their cowboy hat, shit kickers,  and, you know, tight-ass blue jeans.  There's only guys at the bar.  I walk up there.  I said, yeah, I'd like a leg splitter.  Everybody looks at me.  As I'm the, well, one of the things about buying this drink,  they only let you buy one of them because it's got so much alcohol in them.  They put a big black Sharpie X on your hand.  As I'm walking back to the table, everybody in the bar is, like, looking at me,  looking at the drink, looking at my hand, looking at me, just shaking their head. 
[01:39:30]  I was like, oh, man.  It was unbelievable.  Faggy drink, the leg splitter.  Did you split your legs at the end of the night?  That's right.  Well, she did, yeah.  Sure she did.  Well, did they only charge Heather Mills half price?  Yeah.  It was like a $10 drink.  I mean, it looks disgusting.  It looks like they're kind of...  Notice every faggy drink story has to start with,  I'm out with my chick.  Yeah, with my chick.  Did I say chick?  All right. 
[01:40:00]  Should we take a break?  We have to plug before we do this show tonight, Ope.  Yeah.  Shit.  How are we going to give away tickets?  We got, what, 10 tickets to give away?  20.  20?  Well, I think it's 10 because it's...  All right.  Well, is there...  We need a Puerto Rican family coming in one car.  We're doing something really cool tonight.  We're going to be interviewing Jack White's new band.  It's called The Rackin' Tours.  It's basically Jack White, his ex-wife, that make up the White Stripes.  They're adding a guitar player, and I guess he's going to do some different things with 
[01:40:30]  this band.  Very, very cool.  And we get to interview Jack White, and then the band's going to play tonight, like five  or six songs.  It's going to be at the Hit Factory on 54th Street here in Manhattan, starting at 7 o'clock,  I guess.  In front of an intimate crowd.  How are we going to give these away?  Band?  Please, if you're going to use them, don't waste them.  You know what I mean?  Do we have hard tickets?  Yeah, you'll show up there.  We'll give you all the info.  How about they commit, and if they could show up at the station right now, and we could 
[01:41:00]  take their names?  Because then you know they're going to want to go.  That's a good idea.  If you can show up now, but some people might be at work, they get off at 4 or something  like that, and they're able to make it.  Good point, Mr. Norton.  It might be hard to get in on short notes.  Yeah, but we only have like 10 passes.  You could have Eric just stay here all day and give the tickets out.  How about we give away 12 or 13, or 15, knowing there won't be a couple of no-shows.  And if there's a couple of no-shows, well, they take it in.  If you show up here right now, you're committing to going to the show. 
[01:41:30]  If you can, yeah.  Well, let's see how many people show up.  Say we give away five that way.  We do that.  All right.  Glad this was thought through.  Well, if you weren't stuck in Puerto Rico.  I was stuck in Puerto Rico.  We went out of day to figure this shit out.  God forsaken shithole country.  They get welfare, though.  Whatever it is.  Yes, I know what they get.  Lovely.  Awful place.  So how about this?  You show up at the station right now.  If you're one of the first few that show up, we'll give you passes to check out this 
[01:42:00]  whole Rack and Tours thing we're doing tonight at the Hit Factory, okay?  All right.  And I think we're going to tape, and then we're going to broadcast it on another channel  on XM or something.  Ethel and XM Live, I think.  Oh, nice.  And then we'll maybe have some of it on our own channel.  Yeah, there's a good idea.  Where are we located here in Manhattan?  We are at 111 West 57th Street.  Between 7 and 6.  New York, New York. 
[01:42:30]  Right.  1...  Oh, well, we don't need a zip.  You're not mailing yourself here.  Yeah, we're in the Steinway building.  Look for the building with...  USA.  Planet Earth.  Look at Earth.  Look for the building with, like, really nice, expensive pianos.  We're upstairs.  Right.  All right.  Show up and call with your cell phone.  We'll come down, and we'll figure something out.  And guess what?  What, Jimmy?  I'll be in Poughkeepsie Friday and Saturday.  Happy, happy birthday. 
[01:43:00]  That's right.  Bring your sparkle cake.  Speaking of Jimmy, before we go to break, who found this family guy, Ben?  Danny.  Let's get Danny in here real fast.  Danny, get in here!  Danny.  One of my favorite things on the show is when Jimmy, out of nowhere...  See, now we have to tear down the fifth wall.  I hate when we do this.  I hate walls.  A lot of walls.  I hate when we have to tear down walls.  Someday you should just pop the ceiling off so we can all look in.  Do that.  Looking like The Sims?  Yeah.  I hate when we do this, but whatever. 
[01:43:30]  And all of a sudden you'll hear Jimmy just laughing hysterically.  Like, what the hell's going on?  And it turns out Jimmy's just enjoying the comics.  He's enjoying the funny pages of the local papers.  The funnies.  Funny papers.  Funny papers.  You know what's interesting about that?  Everyone at this point knows my brother Elmo.  Yeah.  More psychotic than I.  He's a cartoonist.  He was this close to making it in the funnies.  This close.  He did it one panel.  That close. 
[01:44:00]  He was almost syndicated.  And this is why I enjoy your bit so much because we've talked about this for years.  There is shit in the comics.  The funnies.  Whatever.  They are not funny.  They're not funny.  The ones he did were too close to other ones.  Like, he had the family carnival.  No, my brother's stuff, it's very original.  The lock antlers.  Very original.  Very sarcastic.  And it's really, really a good strip.  I like the one he did with the dog, the cashews. 
[01:44:30]  I'm helping my brother out because maybe there's someone out there that could get him finally published.  You ass.  Yeah.  But honestly, his stuff is really, really smart.  It's very funny.  It's great.  He was part of the New Breeders or something like that, which was all these guys that couldn't get in the regular papers because these people, you know.  I'm getting the papers in the papers.  When you get in the papers, you're there.  Even after you die, they still run your strip.  Forget about it.  Once you're in, you're in.  You're in for generations to come.  So there's a place, and there's other guys out there, I guarantee it, that have comic strips that are way better than anything in the papers. 
[01:45:00]  They can't get syndicated because of whatever the fuck's going on with this shit.  But I had another one.  So when you do it.  What?  I had another one that I thought you did.  Oh, go ahead.  The Marmocetan Halls.  All right.  Very good.  Wait, Danny went oof.  Do you like that one?  Very good.  All right, do you have a better one?  No, I've learned to keep my mouth shut when I'm in here.  So my brother, his MySpace account is Elmo.  I'll give him a little plug there if you want to become his friend. 
[01:45:30]  And he's a very good artist.  Anyway, so the family guy, that's why I enjoy Jimmy's bit because it's something we've talked about for years.  Jimmy would read it like old Fiorello LaGuardia did during the strike, would read the funny papers to our audience.  But it's very hard for him to...  How do you know that?  It's just a famous thing that he did.  They named an airport at him.  Who would he read it to?  He was the mayor?  And he would read it to who? 
[01:46:00]  Like over the radio?  Over the radio.  Over the radio.  Fucking asshole reading funny papers.  There's the mayor.  And they were laughing and laughing.  He's reading the funny papers while, you know, blacks are getting hosed into walls.  That's great.  You know, times were what they were.  What are you going to do?  Way to have your priorities in order, Mr. Mayor.  Jesus.  What the fuck?  Attack dogs all over the city while he's on the radio, enjoying a laugh.  Great guy. 
[01:46:30]  God damn.  Anyway.  Yeah.  So, so, Jimmy would read them.  And it's so hard.  You know, and I understand.  It's just very hard to pay attention.  Because Jimmy himself is laughing so much at the comic, Opie, that it's hard to even figure  out what the hell it's about.  That bit hurts my throat, by the way.  My throat hurts for days after I do that one.  So that bit will not be making many more appearances.  Aw.  It's painful.  Well, now that you're a Hollywood star, you've got to save your voice for the second season.  Lucky Louie, of course.  Well, maybe next week when I'm out there shooting something for NBC. 
[01:47:00]  I mean, who knows?  I've got to go out to L.A. next week, I think.  You know, just do a little shoot.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  They tried doing Don West fucking impressions for an hour.  I can't do Don West.  That's always fun.  I don't do Don West.  Back at N.E.W.  A McGuire social rookie card.  Let me hear you calling, people.  And I'd be coughing up blood that night.  I've been known to lose my voice.  Yeah.  Screaming here and there, too.  Fake screaming, because it's not really real. 
[01:47:30]  Chubby checker.  I'm the most insecure person in radio, so it's not really real or anything.  I've read that.  I know.  Danny, so what do we got with this family guy thing?  The twist is an awful song, by the way.  Go ahead.  Come on, man.  Chubby checker's a douche.  It was terrific for its day, though.  Almost not.  Twist.  The twist.  And then he had to do it again.  Let's twist again, like we did last summer.  Oh, he's trying to twist.  And then the peppermint twist. 
[01:48:00]  And then the third.  Twisting on the fucking.  Yeah, let's twist for the eighth time, because we got hurt last year and couldn't twist then.  Shit, dick, shut up.  Twisting for welfare.  Pardon me while I attack the tough targets like Chubby Checker.  I should have my throat cut.  Yeah, he had a really tough year.  I mean, why'd you?  Did he?  Yeah, he lost his home there in New Orleans.  Oh.  Oh, did he?  I didn't know that.  And all his awards for that fucking song.  Fuck him?  I didn't fuck him?  I didn't know that.  Fuck him?  All right, Danny, what do you got?  Well, I think one of the writers over at Family Guy might be listening to this program. 
[01:48:30]  Uh-oh.  We've been suspicious of that, you know, and we hate to play the hoo-hoo game, but we've  been very suspicious over the years.  Yeah, I mean, there always is that chance of parallel thinking, but, you know, if it was  months and months, you know, removed, I could understand that.  But this is, you know, this is a brand new episode, and this is, you know, weeks out  from when Jim's doing this.  I haven't heard this yet, so basically, who's doing Jimmy's bit?  It's Stewie, actually, threatening somebody by treating them.  He's going to do to them what B.C. does to comedy on a daily basis. 
[01:49:00]  B.C. the comic, yes.  So be it.  I'll do to you what B.C. does to comedy on a daily basis.  Hey, why is Juan so happy?  I think he finally figured himself out.  Huh, I guess it takes Juan to know Juan.  Holy shit.  What's that got to do?  Is there more? 
[01:49:30]  I'll see, he's reading.  Yeah, he read the B.C. strip.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  And then had the obnoxious laugh, kind of exactly like you.  Oh, okay, okay.  Takes Juan to know Juan.  Well, at least it was funny.  Yeah.  I mean, it wasn't drawn out over the top, but I mean, it's the same.  Yeah.  It's the same thing.  Same basic.  Maybe we're a little paranoid.  I mean, it's.  Watch out for the black helicopters outside the window.  And what's the second clip?  Helicopters.  Second clip I just thought was funny.  They come back from commercial. 
[01:50:00]  Peter's watching a TV show starring Tony Danza and Sylvester Stallone called What?  We now return to Tony Danza and Sylvester Stallone in What?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, we're in the war.  Hey, we're in the war.  Hey, we're in the war.  Hey, we're in the war.  You know, you know, my arms, but I never knew that.  That's why I was, you know, I was all the way home.  What?  I would never laugh watching this show.  It's kind of funny.  I know it's a huge show. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  Family Guy is a funny show.  I would never laugh watching it.  No.  Never.  Not even once.  Have you sat and tried it, though?  Yeah.  I should.  He doesn't like cartoons.  I don't.  No, I don't.  The Warner Brothers cartoons I like.  What?  I like the old Warner Brothers.  That's great.  Mr. 1943.  Yeah, I like them.  We'll beat those Japs, too.  Exactly.  Not anymore.  You won't hear that.  All right.  No.  We should take a break.  When we come back, we'll talk about Anthony's problems with his travel.  Great story about Sharon Stone speaking about planes. 
[01:51:00]  Maybe get into Gawker.com.  I have to get into this chair thing at one point today because I want to fucking, I want  to commit a homicide.  Jimmy, chair thing.  A homicide.  Look, chair thing.  Jimmy, chair thing.  Homicide.  The thing.  And something that outraged me.  What?  You're outraged.  And it's our theory.  It's coming to life.  It's happening more and more.  Yes.  There's a band out there called The New Cars. 
[01:51:30]  And you're not going to believe what we uncovered.  What?  Check us out at 11.  You're not going to believe what we found under the hood.  Dum.  But I got to tell you, I'm a little disappointed with your buddy there, Mr. Leno.  Why?  A little disappointed.  Well, we'll get into it next.  A little disappointed.  I'm really surprised he would book The New Cars on his fine, fine late night program.  Don't be disappointed with him.  All right. 
[01:52:00]  Where are we today?  Hi.  Hi.  So we didn't do a show yesterday.  No, we didn't.  Wanted to do a show.  Was scheduled to do a show.  Didn't do a show.  We all started coming back to New York Sunday. 
[01:52:30]  Yep.  Sunday was the big trip.  Lights from all over the place.  Oh, we were everywhere.  All the corners of the globe.  I started getting emails from Anthony, and it looked like you were looking for sympathy  from people, and I got to tell you, we were all like, no, darn.  Dude, let me tell you something.  I never, ever looked for sympathy.  I was keeping everyone informed, and I was venting my anger.  I felt like I was supposed to give you a little something back, and I'm thinking, wow, 
[01:53:00]  I'm starting to think that we got another day of vacation coming.  Yeah, yeah, I know.  So I started getting a nice smile on my face.  No, it was one of those airport nightmares.  But basically, you had an unbelievable vacation.  Vacation ruled.  You said it was like your best vacation ever.  Best vacation ever.  The whole family's there.  You're just drinking, gambling, having a great time.  So now all you need is a nice flight home.  Now I just want to go home.  Now you know the end of the vacation blows anyway. 
[01:53:30]  You know how much that sucks?  You're like, ah, I like day one of the vacation.  When you go, look how much vacation I got.  And how weird is it you go somewhere and you get so attached?  I get so attached to my room and everything.  You get attached.  This is mine.  You're only away for a week, but you feel like it's your new home.  I'm packing up.  And you're leaving.  Why am I emptying my drawers?  You're leaving your room.  You're taking one last look around.  Before you close that door, maybe you open it up again and just like. 
[01:54:00]  My place.  Take it all in.  But no, it's not.  They hose it down and some other sap is in there.  But yeah, great vacation.  And then all you want to do, when my vacation ends, I get to the point where I am homeward bound, on a mission.  Don't get in my way.  I just want to get home after vacation.  A cruise comes to Puerto Rico, like when you're done.  Yeah.  To take you back for your plane ride home, how long before you're supposed to be on the plane?  The day before? 
[01:54:30]  Here's how it works.  And this is the only bitch about a cruise that I'll ever have.  And it's usually just because it came out of Puerto Rico.  Usually I leave out of Miami, which is a breeze.  You leave out of Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico stinks.  Hate that place.  All your baggage has to be put out in front of your door of your stateroom the night before.  Then it is whisked away with a little tag on it. 
[01:55:00]  The tags are color-coded.  What if you want to brush your teeth the next day?  You have a carry-on bag that you keep with you, your important stuff.  Okay.  All your luggage is taken away by people.  And it's color-coded, your tag.  So we had the gray tag.  Other people have red.  And then there are certain people, depending on what time your flight is or something,  that get to leave the boat at certain times.  You leave between 8 and 8.30, 8.39, 9, 9.30.  So we were set to leave between 9.30 and 10. 
[01:55:30]  Our flight was at 2.  We have the white ticket.  Go into this huge warehouse area.  After you're standing on line, you're getting over 3,000 people off a boat.  It takes a while.  So you stand on line.  You've got to go through customs, all that shit.  You find your bag and a big pile of bags that are color-coded.  And then you get to the airport.  And this is what happened.  Got to the airport.  Get on the plane. 
[01:56:00]  Everything's set.  All the bags are on the plane.  We taxi out to the runway.  Here we're ready to go.  There's a little, like, Cessna in front of us.  And that's it.  You're next to take off?  We're next to take off.  Dude, next to go.  Oh, my God.  We've already swung the turn to, like, make that next right turn to the runway.  And then I hear the engine crank up, and I see him make a left turn.  And I go, uh-oh. 
[01:56:30]  We're going away from the runway.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's going to be a little problem.  We're going to go back to the gate, see if maintenance can't take care of this problem as quickly as possible.  And we'll keep you posted.  Hopefully, we can take care of this quickly and be on our way.  All right.  I've got to jump in.  So when you hear that, aren't you hoping at this point, as much as it's going to be a complete hassle, that they're not going to take care of it? 
[01:57:00]  Why?  Because my paranoid mind, I'm thinking now, oh, great.  They're going to fix this, and this thing's going to be in the air?  Here's 99.9% of the time, it isn't something bad.  It's something they can take off and fly with.  But they don't explain that to you, and that's the problem.  Because the layman doesn't know.  But why don't they say it's a dumb light?  The third backup aileron hydraulic system seemed to be a little itchy today. 
[01:57:30]  Could you explain it better?  I don't understand what that means.  The aileron is what makes the aircraft lean left or right.  No one's going to know.  All right.  That's fine.  But I've never been in that situation, thank God.  But if I get that announcement, I'm hoping, even though it's going to be a pain in the ass.  New plane.  New plane.  We're grounded.  I don't want to know that they're making some kind of adjustment just before we take off. 
[01:58:00]  They're just discovering this, because then you wonder what else is fucking wrong with this plane.  Well, this happened.  Your mind starts playing with you.  That's all I'm saying.  Now, this is where we got into the whole American Airlines and their older fleet and stuff.  This problem happened to be a problem.  Like, this was one that was like, I'm kind of glad we didn't get this one.  Dude, and how fucking scary is that?  It was pretty scary.  You were next to take off.  Next to take off.  What if they discovered it as soon as they lifted off?  Like, oh, fuck.  But they have their warnings. 
[01:58:30]  So, obviously, during the taxi, they were checking the systems, all the systems that have to be checked before you take off.  So, they never would have taken off without this noticing.  The problem was the reverse thrusters.  When you land and all of a sudden you feel like they're stepping on the brakes real hard and you hear the engine go,  What they're doing is cranking the engines, but, like, vents will open up.  It closes off the thrust in the back and diverts the thrust forward, kind of down, and really slows you down. 
[01:59:00]  More so.  You're not really feeling wheel brakes when you stop.  It's the engines.  What happened was the left engine, it was doing it for about a second, and then the engine was shut down.  Holy shit.  So, theoretically, if they landed like that, hit the reverse thrusters, the left side shuts down, the right side stops. 
[01:59:30]  You're going to go into a spin.  Spinning down the runway.  Your plane is going to spin down the runway, and it would have been a real fun ride for everyone involved.  I do believe that would have caused a cartwheel.  Yeah.  But, here's me thinking on schedule.  I'm trying to think of the schedule.  I'm going, look, it's not like we're landing at fucking LaGuardia.  Kennedy has a lot of fucking runway.  Just hit the numbers, and we'll coast it out. 
[02:00:00]  We got plenty of runway.  You're insane.  How big a hurry are you in?  Come, I was in.  I wanted to get the fuck out of there.  I know in an emergency situation with an airstrip like Kennedy, they could have hit the numbers and really slow the plane down coming in.  You know, maybe hit a little harder than usual.  But we'd have landed.  You don't need the reverse thrusters unless you're at a short field like that.  Kennedy's really long.  I'd have been fine with it. 
[02:00:30]  It would have been a great adventure.  But, no, they pull back to the gate.  Now, what they're doing is working on the plane.  So, now they've got this Puerto Rican crew down there.  Nothing against the Puerto Rican people except one thing.  They really don't seem to like to work.  I'm sorry.  It's what I saw.  I'll give myself a bell just for being politically incorrect.  But the work ethic there is horrible.  Now, it could have just been at the airport. 
[02:01:00]  I saw some buildings going up, so apparently things are getting done there in Puerto Rico.  Oh, they started those buildings in 72.  Does that happen?  Everything is â€“ it is a country, whatever it is, of crumbling buildings.  Everything looks like clay that is falling apart.  Everything's crumbling.  What the fuck?  Fix your goddamn country.  You wouldn't vacation there?  Never.  Never.  And there are bars on everything, the first three floors of everything. 
[02:01:30]  Doesn't matter what it is.  Drugstore, apartment building, doghouse.  Everything has bars on it.  Some of them try to look decorative.  Look, those are in a diamond shape.  They're bars.  Oh, I thought you meant drinking.  No, no.  Bars.  Metal bars.  To try to keep the criminals out, I guess.  I don't know.  We pull up to the gate.  There's Americans, little staff there in Puerto Rico trying to fix the plane.  They go, okay, keep your seatbelt fastened.  We're going to try the reverse thruster here at the gate. 
[02:02:00]  So they crank the left engine up, and they slam the thruster on, the reverse.  And again, it opens for a second.  Then the whole engine goes, boom, shuts down.  So another half hour or so on the plane before they go.  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to ask you to leave the aircraft, stay at the gate.  We'll know in an hour.  We'll have some more information from you.  And no baggage is going to be allowed to come off this time because the flight is not canceled. 
[02:02:30]  Take your carry-on.  Take your coats.  But stay in the terminal building.  All right.  Here we go.  So now we're sitting out there an hour, one hour, two hours, three.  Now we're just sitting.  That is the worst.  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll have more information at 7 o'clock.  The flight was 2 o'clock, by the way.  2 o'clock was supposed to take off.  It was 1.58 when we turned around from the runway. 
[02:03:00]  And now they're telling us 7 o'clock, we'll know everything.  At this point, people are starting to talk about cancellation and everything.  So we're up at the counter.  We're about five people back from the counter just looking to get our coats because we hadn't taken our coats off the plane when they canceled the flight.  An animal stampede to the frigging counter now where we just want to get our coats because they're giving away vouchers to the hotels and for food. 
[02:03:30]  We finally get up there, get the coats, and the guy goes, wait, wait for your vouchers.  I go, keep your fucking vouchers.  Keep your fucking vouchers.  I'm like, I'm going to stay at wherever they're putting up the rest of the animals that are on this plane.  I just got off one of the grandest cruise ships over the seas, and I'm going to stay at some fleabag Puerto Rican Marriott or something? 
[02:04:00]  No.  I had them drive me back.  A mere day prior, you were in a tuxedo drinking a chocolate martini.  That's right.  Dude.  Exactly.  That's what you thought about.  I was fancy.  I had a guy in a pig mask blowing me.  And there I was trying to be handed a voucher to some fleabag hotel that they put people up in when this happens. 
[02:04:30]  Can't they get a plane in Puerto Rico?  So before we left, I went to every airline in the Puerto Rican airport.  Continental, JetBlue, everything.  Nothing.  They go, no, it's very hard on Sunday.  Very hard to get flied out.  Everything closed.  Walking around a ghost town airport.  It's a fucking airport.  It's supposed to be planes leaving, coming in all hours, all days.  Nothing.  Nothing.  So I get into the cab. 
[02:05:00]  Had him drive me back to the Caribe Hilton, where I first started this wonderful journey.  So I go to get a cab.  And the cab driver doesn't understand.  He goes, voucher.  Voucher.  He's looking for my fucking cab voucher and hotel voucher.  He's ready to take me to the shithole.  I go, no.  I go, Caribe Hilton.  Get me to the Caribe Hilton.  I can't lose this mind.  They're ready to stick me in a van full of probably 18 people. 
[02:05:30]  Full of normal people.  Everyday people.  Full of 18 animals.  Everyone is pissed.  Everyone stinks.  Everyone doesn't want to be there.  You almost had to hang out with regular people.  No, no.  Well below regular people, Opie.  Well below regular people.  These are just travelers who are annoyed.  No, they're not.  They're just travelers.  Savage, savage animals.  They're just travelers from Charlotte.  No.  North Carolina.  They're just not millionaires.  I don't care where they were from. 
[02:06:00]  They were all awful, degenerate people that I wanted no part of.  They were piling them in these vans to cart them off to some flea bag hotel with bars on the windows.  Long line waiting to get in the hotel.  Oh, you know what check-in would have been like with their vouchers and their thing?  No.  Caribe.  Real room service.  I had the chicken.  It was wonderful.  Oh, sounds good.  And now the information I got was 8 o'clock in the morning.  Next day.  Next day there will be a brand spanking new 767. 
[02:06:30]  Your tickets are fine.  You'll get the same seats.  Everybody's happy.  Fine.  I wake up, whatever time, 5 o'clock in the morning, you know, make sure I'm early, get there, to be told that my 8 o'clock flight will be leaving promptly at 4 p.m.  4 p.m.  4.  So I lose my mind.  And here is now where I finally understood how people get arrested at the airport. 
[02:07:00]  You ever read through the paper?  We've done it here.  Man makes threat at airport.  Man talks about bomb.  Man talks about gun.  He's arrested.  And I've sat here and gone, what kind of idiot even talks about stuff like that?  You're online.  You're security.  You go through.  You don't make jokes about, hey, I got a bomb in here.  Why are you searching it?  You got.  Because I swear to you, when she told me my 8 o'clock flight that I was there for was now leaving at 4 p.m., 
[02:07:30]  I was ready to go, I am going to machine gun this entire motherfucking building before I blow it up.  That's what was in my head.  Dude, I was.  How close our plane was for taking off, that's how close my mouth was to spewing out the words.  Right on the tip of the floor.  I am bombing this plane.  I swear I was that close.  And all I could muster, I had enough smarts in my head where I just let out a jimmy line. 
[02:08:00]  I turned to my girlfriend and went, I'm going to bite someone's face because I figured that's not a felony to threaten to bite someone's face.  Which means you're hungry.  And I was a little hungry.  But I swear to you, I was so close to going, I'm shooting you.  I'm shooting you if I don't get a fucking plane out of here.  And then you're arrested.  And I started going through the scenario, like, if I'm arrested, do they fly me to Miami?  Because I could probably get a flight out of there if I get arrested and maybe they fly. 
[02:08:30]  Does Gitmo have a little air service maybe if I say I'm a terrorist?  All scenarios.  You would never survive in a Puerto Rican jail.  No.  They're not exactly clean.  No.  I would be all away.  Please, sir, sir, I was just on a nice cruise ship.  You would continue drinking chocolate martinis.  I don't think they'd be tasting the same.  No.  They call it the tossed salad in the prison.  They got me a flight to Fort Lauderdale and then from Fort Lauderdale to LaGuardia Airport, which wasn't bad. 
[02:09:00]  It was a 9 o'clock flight.  So I just had to hang out for a little bit.  Lauderdale was a 757, not a spacious 767.  But okay, I'll take it.  Flew to Lauderdale, waited, got on that flight, landed at LaGuardia.  I guess it was...  Anyone familiar with the New York area?  I know we're national here, but LaGuardia Airport. 
[02:09:30]  Scariest airport in America.  Probably the shortest runways ever.  Shortest runways ever.  We've got to explain it to people that have never flown into LaGuardia.  It's okay in a 757.  It's like being on a roller coaster.  They don't land anything bigger than like 757s there.  You will not see 767s.  747s are completely out of the question.  So you really do hit hard and stop very short when you're in a bigger plane like a 757. 
[02:10:00]  It is scary.  But LaGuardia is right near wonderful...  And I even pointed it out.  Really fast, too, about LaGuardia, too, is you see water until the last second.  You see water and then wheels hit.  Well, they've built the apron out into Flushing Bay.  You still see water.  What?  I'll deal with it in a minute.  I smell something.  I'll deal with it in a minute.  Go ahead.  Okay, Jimmy.  Oh, my God.  I'll deal with it in a minute.  Jimmy's food is...  Jimmy's had it.  I'll deal with it in a minute.  It's like my flight.  All right.  Yeah, they built the apron out into Flushing Bay because so many planes were sliding off 
[02:10:30]  the end of the runway.  No, I'm talking before you hit, though.  Yeah, yeah.  All you see is water, water, water, water, water, bam, wheels hit.  Yeah, then you're in there.  You don't hover over the runway for a little while.  And it's wonderful because you get a nice view.  I pointed out Shea Stadium to my girlfriend.  I go, oh, look, Shea.  You know, I noticed the lights were on, which was nice.  See Shea.  Land, it's 4 o'clock.  Get in my bags.  By about 5 o'clock, 5 on a Monday afternoon at LaGuardia Airport. 
[02:11:00]  What do I have to take?  The Grand Central, Long Island Expressway, heading eastbound, rush hour, New York City,  with Shea Stadium letting out for opening day.  Packed crowd here at Shea Stadium.  Biggest crowd.  Biggest opening day crowd ever.  Biggest opening day crowd ever.  Remember, I was listening.  I got in a cab.  I'm listening to Mike and the Mad Dog here in New York. 
[02:11:30]  They're on there.  And Mad Dog's talking.  I was late getting into work today.  I couldn't even get in past Shea Stadium there, Mikey.  It was unbelievable.  The crowd, the traffic, probably the worst it's ever been here in New York City.  Another hour and a half drive to get home from LaGuardia.  Dude, I'm 15 minutes away, maybe.  In some traffic.  It would take me 15 minutes to get to LaGuardia. 
[02:12:00]  It's an hour and a half.  Just a nightmare.  How livid were you in the cab?  No, by that point, I was a beaten man.  I was a beaten man.  I was laughing.  It was like I was on some kind of gas.  It was just...  Dude.  You got to talk about what happened at the luggage thing.  Yes.  I was about to jump in here because, yes, Tony is correct.  We also had a problem on our plane on Sunday.  Tony. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  You were on my flight Sunday?  Yep.  Back from Providencial.  Oh, you were in Turks?  Yeah.  Very cool.  Yeah.  You talked to me.  Where did I talk to you?  My wife moved your luggage.  This wife?  Well, we were online in the lobby.  You weren't there and your girlfriend was moving all the luggage.  Oh, you're from Wontaw?  Yeah.  Sitting in first class, all fancy.  Yeah.  Well, you see, did you have any idea I knew who you are? 
[02:13:00]  No.  I was just being nice.  I'm like, oh, you're from Long Island.  My brother's got a restaurant.  I did that whole thing, huh?  Yeah.  I didn't know you were a fan of the show.  I had no clothes.  Of course.  I'm just being nice because I heard his wife and I could hear the Long Island accent.  So I'm like, oh, you guys are from Long Island.  Yeah, go ahead, Tony.  Yeah.  Don't you remember?  No, I totally remember now.  I remember who you guys were.  Yeah.  We had the problem with the front landing gear.  Yeah.  Was it cantered?  No.  The guy, the pilot comes on. 
[02:13:30]  I wish I could do pilot voice.  Yeah.  Because they're so calm.  And basically, what did he say?  Is there a break on the landing gear or something like that?  Yeah, it seemed like whatever it does, it makes it come up automatically or something.  No, no.  What it does is prevents the wheel from spinning, which makes some crazy freaking noises that  will scare the shit out of the passengers.  Yeah.  So basically, he said that apparatus that prevents the wheel from spinning really fast is broken,  so the wheel's going to spin really fast.  And when we take off, you're going to hear a noise that you might not have heard before. 
[02:14:00]  Bye!  And we don't want you guys to be scared, but it's a problem, but it's not a safety issue.  It's not a safety issue.  We'll land perfectly and all that.  But sure enough, man, we take off, you hear the noise, and you're like, you still think  it might be another noise in the engine?  And you're like, holy shit, I've got to deal with this?  Wow.  It scared the hell out of me.  That's fine.  Yeah, American.  Yeah, American.  You could hear it back there, it was bad.  No, I heard it.  Fucking American.  I heard it, and I'm like, that's coming from just a little wheel thing?  Are you kidding me? 
[02:14:30]  See, that's where my paranoia takes place.  I'm like, are they not telling us about something else here?  Yeah, I spent two hours wondering if it was going to come down when we landed.  Yeah, and then the same noise as they, you know.  Yeah, you think it's going to wreck something.  Yeah.  What is rule 240 that Shwuggy is asking about?  Hey, thanks, Tony.  All right, Oak, take care.  All right, bro.  Bye-bye.  I had no idea that guy was a fan.  Shwuggy.  Hey, guys, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, I'm going to give you guys a piece of advice that's going to save you a lot of aggravation  like Anthony just had. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  If you're ever on a flight and there is a problem like you had, Anthony, one that is the airline's  fault.  Uh-huh.  You wait until everyone clears out, and then you go up to the ticket agent and say, rule  240 me.  What is that, you ask?  That is something that is in their contract that basically says they must come up with  a solution that is suitable to you.  This sounds like an urban legend.  No, no, no.  Go to the website.  Do you know if you send out an email, Microsoft will send you a dollar per email? 
[02:15:30]  Type in rule 240, and you'll see what I'm talking about.  You flew American, right?  Yeah.  In American, and I'm reading right from the website, they have something here.  You can find it on the web.  Yeah.  Blah, blah, blah.  It says everything they can do.  If the alternative American Airlines flight is not acceptable to you, you have the right  to be confirmed on the flight of a different airline at no additional cost.  Yeah, there was no airline available.  I went to every single airline.  In the airport.  Every single one.  No one was flying out.  Okay, I'm just saying, if that ever happens again, like I said, go to Google, type in 
[02:16:00]  rule 240.  Oh, I'll work on American, believe me.  I'll work on them.  I will get a full refund.  Right, but I'm just saying, if that ever happens to you again, and let's say you're  at a New York airport, they have to put you on.  I'll invoke rule 240, sir.  Thank you.  You got it.  They'll look at you like, what?  What the fuck is he talking about?  He's walking around the airport.  Rule 240.  I said.  All right.  440.  Give him the stick up the ass.  Can you say 420 like you pot? 
[02:16:30]  They arrest you?  Yeah, really.  That's Swiggy.  Diplomatic immunity.  Swiggy.  Swiggy setting you up for a rape.  I did want to get into the baggage carousel, though, quickly.  Everybody that was on that flight was pretty much from the refugee flight that I was on  when we finally landed at LaGuardia.  So, we're waiting for our bags to come out.  So, we're waiting for our bags to come out.  The baggage carousel starts.  A few bags come out, none of which are mine or many other people's out of there.  Baggage carousel stops and does not start again for 40 minutes. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, I fucking hate them.  40 minutes.  We stood there looking, looking at the baggage carousel.  JFK are the worst for luggage.  Waiting for it to stop again.  If you're flying in Newark, man, before you even get to the carousel, your luggage is  pretty much waiting for you.  Depends on the airline.  But JFK and LaGuardia is ridiculous.  What, do they have one crew that unloads these planes?  Unbelievable.  They should be executed.  Unbelievable.  So, while the carousel's running, though, at one point, this small girl. 
[02:17:30]  Now, me and my girlfriend's standing there with the little cart and everything right  at the beginning.  Because I like when it pops out, I grab my bag, get the fuck out of there.  We're standing there, and this little girl, a little toddler girl is kind of walking around.  And, you know, the flaps of plastic that keep you from seeing what bags are coming out of  a little wall?  And then the little conveyor and stuff?  She's fiddling with this shit.  Dude, she's two-something?  I don't even know how old those disgusting little fucking rats are. 
[02:18:00]  I think she was two.  She's got her hand in there.  So, I'm looking at my girlfriend, and I'm going, oh, they're safe.  There's some great parent that's doing this, just letting her kid fucking, you know, put  her hand in there.  And there are those danger stickers all over the place, which I love.  This one was the red danger, and then it had the gears with the mashed-up hand in the  gears.  You ever see it?  The serrated hand? 
[02:18:30]  Yes.  Pinch area.  It had that, and it had the other one where it showed a hand completely cut in two.  I love the danger signs.  You don't have to understand English to read it.  But red danger everywhere.  So, I start goofing that, I go, this is brilliant.  Another parent that just, and this is after a flight of kids, you know, yelling and waiting  at airports, having them screaming and running.  So, I'd had it. 
[02:19:00]  But the mother picks the kid up, looks at us, and goes, I just love getting advice from  people who have no clue, who aren't parents and don't know anything.  I, I would, I go, lady, do you see, it says danger there.  Your kid's sticking her fingers in the goddamn machinery.  I go, what am I supposed to do?  I go, good.  I go, I hope she loses her fucking hand, so at least I'll be entertained standing here.  And then, and then, and she walks away, and she starts coming back. 
[02:19:30]  Now, she's, she's pissed at us, because we said something, and she can't leave it alone.  She comes back and goes, all you people with no children don't even understand what it's  like.  And, and, and, and I said something to the effect of, when your kid is older, and you  have to pin her corsage on during her prom, because she's got that one hand, and you're  just, the guilt that you've been feeling all those years, remember me.  I go, just remember me, because I'm the one that was saying, keep your kid's hand out 
[02:20:00]  of the fucking thing.  And she walks away again, comes back for another, like, volley, back and forth of how we don't  understand.  And then some other woman, out of nowhere, comes up and goes, you really know it all, guys  that, uh, people that don't have kids.  I go, you, you, you're getting involved?  I go, do you understand that kid was, where it says danger, was sticking her fingers in  there?  She goes, oh, I must have come in in the middle of it.  I'm sorry.  Fucking nosy, nosy, nosy, Nancy, Nancy, rag. 
[02:20:30]  They're everywhere.  They're everywhere, those.  I couldn't believe, I started laughing.  I started laughing again, that this woman, they don't understand, don't get me wrong,  to hear the shriek of a small child as their hand is ripped from their arm, would have been  the best part of my vacation.  Fuck, fuck the tuxedo, the fancy drinks, the chocolate thing, to hear that scream and 
[02:21:00]  the mother go, can I, let me try, I'll try.  To hear the mother do that would have brought a joy to me that nothing, Christmas morning  at eight, couldn't have brought me the joy.  But I said something, and I got shit for it from that mother.  I got shit for it.  Keep your, a request to parents everywhere. 
[02:21:30]  Can I just give a request?  Could you kill your kids?  Just kill them all.  And if you can't, keep them under control.  When we were sitting in the airport waiting in Puerto Rico, there were three kids playing,  chasing each other around the ticket thing by me, by everyone else, and they're  screaming as they're doing it. 
[02:22:00]  And the parents aren't doing shit about this.  Why?  And it's not that people don't understand, it's that we don't give a fuck.  Good for you with your kids, but be around only people with kids.  Then you can make each other fucking miserable.  We don't care about, I don't care about your kid, your kid.  First of all, it isn't the cutest kid in the world.  It's not so fucking smart.  Do you know how smart my children?  No, it's not.  It's just another one.  It's another little organism that has to grow up and, and, and drop dead on the planet. 
[02:22:30]  That's all it amounts to.  And the less it annoys me, the better.  It's not fun to be around.  It annoys me.  I don't have kids because I don't want to be annoyed by yours running around screaming.  Here's what your little angel is.  The byproduct of a load.  Right.  That's what it is.  There you go.  I had an interaction with the kid.  With the child.  Oh, I hope it resulted in the kid's death.  That's right.  Well, your conviction. 
[02:23:00]  I was at the airport down in the islands there, and I decided to do some of that duty-free  shopping.  Duty.  You don't get any deals, but they had a nice sunglass display, you know, Maui gyms.  I'm like, I kind of like the Maui gyms when I'm doing my inline skating and stuff.  They're nice, lightweight, and you don't even feel like you got sunglasses on.  And I got an old pair now.  I'm thinking of getting a new pair, right?  Duty-free.  And I'm duty-free shopping.  Duty.  And, uh...  Not no duty. 
[02:23:30]  You know the sunglass case where it revolves inside, and at the bottom, because it's a  locked case, you can kind of move the spindle around, whatever you want to call it.  Uh-huh.  So I'm, like, spinning around to see all the latest Maui gyms.  I'm like, oh, wow, that's interesting.  Oh, wow, that's a smaller pair, right?  And I'm, like, looking at the case and spinning at the same time.  Also, I'm like, wow, it doesn't spin anymore.  I'm like, what the hell's going on, right?  I'm looking around, and I'm like, why isn't this thing spinning?  And the guys next to me were staring at the sunglasses that are higher up, right, in this 
[02:24:00]  case.  Uh-huh.  I'm like, what the...  So I looked down.  It's a girl that had her fucking hair braided, because she was in the islands, and that's  the look you have to have.  Yeah.  And the kids have to have their hair braided to look like fucking Bo Derek.  They gotta look sexy at three.  Right.  That's nice.  Good one.  Was she wearing a thong with juicy on it?  Fucking parents.  So this girl couldn't have been, uh, this little girl couldn't have been more than two.  She is defiantly holding the bottom in another section so the thing doesn't spin anymore. 
[02:24:30]  You know what you do?  You grab it, spin it real hard, and I hope her little fingers break.  So I look down at her.  You just...  You make them cry.  It's nicer than what I was gonna say.  I look down at her, and I start out by being nice.  I'm like, excuse me, you know, let go.  We're trying to look at glasses here.  And she gives me that look, knowing that she's getting to me, and continues to hold  it and stare in my eyes.  Where's the parents?  Uh...  Where are they?  Because... 
[02:25:00]  Because I don't hold the children responsible.  But where were the parents?  Honestly, I'll get to that.  Like, ten feet away, tops.  Mm-hmm.  So I'm looking down at her.  I'm like, you gotta be fucking kidding me.  And now the guy is, like, trying to be nice.  Like, let go of that.  Let go of that.  So we could spin this and look at the glasses.  And she just, with those eyes, knowing she's doing something wrong.  Teach her the C word early.  That's exactly what I was gonna say.  Staring right into her eyes, like, no, I'm not gonna let go.  I'm like, all right.  Well, here we go.  Yank!  Oh, good. 
[02:25:30]  Finger gets caught just enough where you hear a yelp, like a half cry.  Nice.  And runs to her parents.  And her parents look up from their books and stuff, because they can't be bothered.  Can't be bothered.  And they look up at the sunglasses, and I'm just going about my business like, you know,  your kid's crying.  I have no idea.  We're looking at sunglasses here, right?  And the kid is now on the lap, pouting and stuff and staring, and I'm just making believe  I have no idea what's going on, you know?  And the parents are trying to figure it out, and, you know, the kid's not gonna point it  out, because she knows she was doing something wrong. 
[02:26:00]  Right.  So I got her tiny little finger caught just enough to get...  Beautiful.  ...take care of the situation, right?  So now we're waiting at the airport for over an hour, and I'm now playing my PSP, which is the  greatest invention ever when you're traveling, by the way.  A lot of fun.  Video games as you travel?  Are you kidding me?  The future is here.  The only problem is they have to, you know, look at your carry-on every single time, because  they have no idea what it is yet.  You would think they would give them the fucking memo.  It's a PSP.  You know what you say to them?  You go, what do you think I have, a bomb?  Yeah.  That's great.  But every time I travel... 
[02:26:30]  See the wounds that other people don't see?  Every time I travel with the PSP, they open up in the bag, and then they just point with  their, you know, their plastic glove hand, take that out, all nervous, I'm like, are you  kidding me?  Pull it out of the case, turn it on, I'm like, here, see?  Play.  Playing the...  Boy, you suck at that.  Yeah, two players, two players.  Two player.  So I'm back in my seat waiting for, you know, the flight to take off.  I'm playing my PSP, and the girl walks by.  I'm so involved in my game, and Lindsay's sitting next to me, and I look up just to 
[02:27:00]  give her the look.  Good.  Like you.  And Lindsay goes, you did not just, you know, stare her down again.  You have to.  I'm like, absolutely I did, and then she ran off again.  She knew she was playing with fire.  Run.  But got her finger caught, took care of the situation.  Never.  They don't get it.  For how much that one woman kept coming back and saying, you don't understand, you don't  have kids.  You, no, you don't.  You're the, you're the one that has to understand. 
[02:27:30]  You have the kid.  I don't have to understand.  You do.  You have to understand how annoying a child is to people that don't have kids.  You have to understand and fix the problem.  That kid cannot be running around like a nut.  Just because...  And yelling some fucking discipline.  You can't use the excuse, what am I going to do as a kid?  Yeah.  Because I'll tell you.  What am I going to do?  Because I'll tell you this.  I finally got on the plane, right?  And right in front of us, young family.  A guy, his wife, and a baby. 
[02:28:00]  And I'm like, oh, God.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Less than a year.  Perfect for a screamer.  Perfect.  Right?  The kid was beyond well-behaved.  Anytime there was maybe a hint that something was going to go wrong, the mother and the father there took care of the situation.  Because they were considerate to others around them.  They did their best.  That's all I care about.  Like the back of the bus on MASH.  But honestly, when I'm traveling and stuff, that's all I care about is the parents at least try. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  In these situations, you see parent after parent after parent not trying.  Like, what am I going to do?  Give it a try.  Because I'll tell you sometimes it's more entertaining to watch the parent try and fail.  At least then you're getting some noise, but you're getting some entertainment.  Like, I will laugh hysterically.  I've openly laughed at kids throwing temper tantrums and their parents trying to deal with it.  Right, right.  I've sat there just going, look at this.  Look, look.  And the kid's on the floor, hanging by one arm, swinging.  Ah! 
[02:29:00]  Ah!  And you're just going, look, they can't do shit about this.  That's right.  Lady, just go over there.  Kick her in the cunt.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  So we had a three-hour flight, three-plus-hour flight, Ant.  Yeah.  Not a peep.  I perfectly behaved.  And like I said, almost acting up, they just did what parents should do, in my opinion, right?  So obviously the flight lands, and I had to.  I complimented them.  Like, man, you've got a great kid there, well-behaved, blah, blah, blah.  And the smile that it brought to these parents, that someone acknowledged that they were doing their best because they know that flying with a kid could be a nightmare for people, other people. 
[02:29:30]  And that's all you want in the end is the parents to try, right?  It's not my responsibility to deal with your kid.  It's your responsibility to not have your kid act like a wild beast running around, annoying everybody.  Because believe me, your kid is annoying everybody if they're running around in circles screaming.  Hey, before we move on from, you know, flying and traveling and stuff, there's a great, quick little thing in the New York Post today about Sharon Stone. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, here, her movie did really well.  Basic Instinct 2 did, what, $3 million at the box office?  Just double what it should have made.  No one wants to see it.  Who wants to see that?  Should have made $3 million is a disaster.  The promo they were showing, the trailer, where it was, wow, hey, they're doing the scene again, and they put a big black box over her box as she crosses her and uncrosses her leg. 
[02:30:30]  They use the same gimmick in this one, and who wants to see that?  Who wants to see that?  Oh, my God.  Dried up twat.  Oh, Jesus.  Fucking awful white nurse shoes.  How long ago was the first movie?  86, maybe?  No.  Was it?  She opens her legs and her lips hit the floor.  Derek knows.  Oh, Jesus.  Rolls out.  Rolls out like fruit roll-ups.  Bleh.  A sack of potatoes.  If your private area makes this noise, there could be a problem. 
[02:31:00]  No one wants to see that piece of garbage.  So it made $3 million in, what, Ice Age?  The, what do they call it?  The meltdown or the freaking global warming?  Those dang kid movies that do so well.  It's $70 million in three days.  Yeah.  I saw the original one on vacation.  Yeah, it's good.  It was definitely good.  Anyway, so Sharon Stone in the post today.  First class mom.  Listen to what Sharon Stone did on a recent flight. 
[02:31:30]  There's a good reason why Sharon Stone above had a first class seat last Friday flying from New York to Los Angeles.  While her nine-month-old son, Laird, sat in coach with his nanny.  Wait a minute.  Let me read that again.  All right.  All right.  Come on.  This is great.  And this is what Hollywood's all about.  There's a good reason why Sharon Stone above had a first class seat last Friday flying from New York to Los Angeles while her nine-month-old son, Laird, sat in coach with his nanny. 
[02:32:00]  Oh.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Technically, you're not supposed to have babies in first class.  You're not supposed to have them up there.  Oh.  What happens?  I see it all the time.  I know.  You're not thinking either, though.  At that point.  She's got to take the bullet.  You give the nanny the first class seat and go, I have no choice.  You don't fucking leave your nine-month-old son.  Absolutely not.  You stick that fucking lady with it and go, this is what I pay you for.  Deal with this fucking thing that I popped out of my fucking box that no one wants to see. 
[02:32:30]  Three million.  That's exactly what you do.  You stick it in coach with the nanny.  Here, whore.  Hold this.  Hold this thing I should have swallowed.  Wow.  That's exactly what you do with it.  Don't fucking interfere with people up there.  Throw it in the fucking back.  Throw it with the fucking chimps in the fucking, in the animal cage where they put dogs.  She's got, she's got balls, bro.  I love her for that.  She's got balls.  First class was sold out, so she got one ticket. 
[02:33:00]  One ticket.  She's taking it.  She's taking it.  Fuck the kid.  Fuck the nanny.  Just like Howie jumping in the cab first.  So his freaking girlfriend could get spit on.  Take the spit.  It's the whole ego thing, bro.  Can the intern who brought my food please come in here, whoever the fuck you are.  Yeah, we'll get to that in a second.  Oh, boy.  Real fast.  So it's a paragraph.  First class was sold out, a spokeswoman explained.  She tried to get them seats in first class but couldn't, and she didn't want them on a separate plane.  So it wasn't even an option in her head to deal with it and sit and coach with her own fucking kid.  No. 
[02:33:30]  Separate plane.  Stone, whose basic instinct was savaged by critics and grossed a poultry $3.2 million its opening weekend,  did venture back among the hoi polloi.  Ah, a hoi polloi.  You look like a scotch ad.  Did venture back among the hoi polloi to visit her tot and to tell the nanny to keep him in his seat for safety's sake,  even if he wailed, which he did.  Oh, fantastic.  She's in first class enjoying the- 
[02:34:00]  Sipping champagne.  The warm cookies and everything else while her kid is fucking wreaking havoc.  Screaming in the back from mommy's tit.  Great.  Wonderful.  I thought that was a good story, so.  What's the problem, Jimmy?  I got two things I got to deal with.  Number one, just curiosity.  I'm not annoyed, but this is how I got my omelet.  This is how I got it.  What is that?  I don't know.  That's ketchup.  You asked for ketchup, right?  Yes, I asked for ketchup, but in packets. 
[02:34:30]  Did you open this and put ketchup on it?  No, the guy did it.  He had like a-  A ketchup thing.  Yeah, he had a ketchup.  He had that-  No, the ketchup squeezer.  That he probably licks so it doesn't get all crusty.  You know, like-  You've seen those things.  I didn't touch anything.  And every once in a while, kids will pick their nose and then pick up the ketchup and  then like, you know, use their finger to get the ketchup that just happens to be out  of the cap.  All right.  You want me to get another one?  No, no, no.  It's cool.  I did say ketchup. 
[02:35:00]  I just went into that.  That's my fault.  I wasn't-  By the way, in diners, you know what happens a lot?  They suck on it.  So this one.  Someone will be using their knife, cutting, knife and fork, cutting, cutting.  Lick the knife.  Mm-hmm.  And then stick it in the ketchup bottle to go, ting, ting, ting, ting, ting, to get the  ketchup out.  How about never again using ketchup in a diner?  Thank you very much.  Gotta use the packets.  Give me a packet.  You all right, Jimmy?  No, yeah.  I'm glad you guys had a terrific vacation.  Here's what I was dealing with.  And I'll just do this real quick because it made me so angry, I almost threw up. 
[02:35:30]  By the way, I didn't have a terrific vacation.  I want to explain that a little later.  Why?  Well, that's your thing because you started.  I want to hear.  You started your thing.  I, um, about a month ago, over a month ago, I have nowhere to eat in my apartment.  I have a chair that I do on my computer, which is the jerk-off chair.  And I have like a little bar area, which I need bar stools for.  You haven't gotten bar stools for your bar area so you can eat?  Oh, yes, I have.  Sorry, Jeff.  That's okay.  I have, uh, I ordered them. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, no.  And, um, it was probably a month and a half ago.  They said I'd be a couple weeks, whatever.  Yeah.  So for the last three and a half weeks, I've been on the phone with this company.  And I've never, and I've bitched about companies.  I've never hated a fucking company as much as I hate the chair factory on Bowery Street.  I hate these fucking liars.  This is the problem with my bar stools.  I love our plugs on this show. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, you're just great.  Most people plug things to get, like, stuff or to get maybe a little favor, a plugola, they call it sometimes, or just to give a compliment.  Today, so far, American Airlines sucks.  And, Jimmy, the chair factory?  On Bowery in New York City.  I would never want to dial that and hit extension one or two for customer service or maybe extension three for, you know, a customer service extension two to see what happens to an order.  These fucking lying motherfuckers. 
[02:37:00]  For three weeks, my bar stools.  I mean, I know where to sit and eat.  I've been sitting in a warehouse in Brooklyn, and all they're telling me is, oh, we can't get a truck.  They can't get a truck from Manhattan and the fucking cunt that I talked to guaranteed me last week that I'd try me on Friday.  I tried them on Friday.  They're guaranteed.  Monday or Tuesday, we'll have them delivered.  I call again.  They can't get a truck.  And she's telling me, well, now it's going to be next week.  The owner, Abe Belsky, you know, Irish fella.  Abe Belsky won't get on the fucking phone. 
[02:37:30]  I hate these fucking people.  Dude, I have never dealt with such an arrogant fucking company in my life.  I told them, look, I'm going to talk about this on the air.  People don't understand when you say that.  You're telling them you really don't want this to happen.  And the one guy's like, hey, you got to do what you got to do.  Oh, really?  And then he hung up on me.  I got hung up on a week ago.  I wasn't, I fucking, dude, I want to fucking set fire to this fucking place. 
[02:38:00]  I am so angry at these fucking people, dude.  It's almost like I want to cry.  I'm so frustrated.  And everybody has dealt with this type of arrogant cunt fuck company thing where they just,  they don't give a fuck about you.  That you're nobody to them.  And then when you, like, you know, you know, Gotham Comedy actually called me because I  bashed them on the air.  They're like, hey, what's the problem?  But you know what?  If I didn't bash them on the air, it never would have been a phone call.  Of course.  Nobody gives a fuck until it affects them. 
[02:38:30]  This chair factory is the worst company I've ever dealt with.  They are lying to me constantly.  You know what?  Unfortunately, Jimmy, it's not just them.  There is something that has happened.  There is something that has happened because as you recall, I had my furniture problem.  Yep.  Yeah.  It's just something that has happened with customer service, with actually being able to deliver  the goods.  They can't do it anymore.  Something happens somewhere along the way where that isn't even an option anymore. 
[02:39:00]  It's, hey, you're going to pay us and you're going to take our shit.  You're just going to take whatever shit we deal out to you.  We're going to give you windows of delivery that are eight hours wide.  We're not going to show up.  We're going to lie to you about dates and you're going to pay us for this pleasure.  Have a nice day.  Well, this is what she finally says about the delivery.  She's like, well, we can have a truck to you on Friday.  I'm like, you guaranteed me Monday or Tuesday.  Well, Friday is the best we can do. 
[02:39:30]  Well, I'm going to be in Poughkeepsie Friday.  Well, it's a COD.  I'm like, what do you mean COD?  I paid half.  I'll pay.  We have to swipe the credit card.  You either come down to the store and swipe the credit card or pay a certified bank check.  This fucking piece of shit company.  I'm like, your company.  You're buying golden stools?  Dude, they're not even that much.  It's fucking enraging.  I'm like, well, your company is going to have to eat the bullet on this one or take the hit  and let me do it over the phone because you're the ones that screwed up.  And she's like, well, then Monday, because you have to pay by a certified bank check. 
[02:40:00]  They agreed to waive or cash.  Are people running off with stools?  They haven't been able to.  With bad checks?  I don't have the number, but apparently somebody in PalTalk got the number yesterday.  And might I say, I would never encourage people to call that number.  I was fucking howling at the awful Ramon calls that would be made.  Ramon, deliver my stools, you whore.  Just awful Ramon impressions.  Fucking Neo does the worst Ramon ever, but it was funny. 
[02:40:30]  He's a fucking psychopath, but it was really funny.  He could use him as a stool to bring him over.  It's just the time, next Monday, I'm like, I'm going to be on the air from 7 to 11.  Can I have a delivery window?  And she goes, no, the driver will call you Monday.  Oh, they won't even give me a window.  So I'm like, you know what?  Fuck that.  I'll wait until they get to the store.  You've handled this your way.  I am going to handle this my way.  I've been nice enough to Abe Belsky and that fucking company.  I have been lied to by that company. 
[02:41:00]  And I'm not slandering you.  This is what happened.  You lied to me week after week after week.  And I'm sick and tired of being shit on me.  They have no fucking loyalty to you once you spend your money.  They don't give a fuck.  They don't care.  How many people have had problems that eat a bullet with merchandise?  It happens once in a while.  Paul and Denise do a good job.  But when I get a message...  Jimmy comes over and sucks your dick.  Even if the merchandise comes over and sucks your dick, just for buying it.  Just for customer service.  Right.  But no, there's been problems.  And a lot of times I don't get your messages. 
[02:41:30]  But when I do get one sent to me, yellow treats is the best way to get it to me.  I try to write back.  I'm sorry this happened.  I always forward it to Paul.  What's going on?  We try to get something going.  I try at least to make it right.  I'm not saying I always do.  But I always at least try when I hear about it to get back to you.  This fucking owner.  Well, he's out of the country until Thursday.  That's what I heard last week.  Oh, good.  He's out of the country until Thursday.  They won't give me the warehouse number.  I asked the one guy.  Well, does the same guy own the warehouse and then owns the store?  I'm not at liberty to discuss that.  What?  Why?  Is it the fucking mafia shithead? 
[02:42:00]  Oh, now you've done it.  Not with Belsky, it's not.  What's the problem?  The problem is in this day and age, there's just a problem.  Maybe some.  You can't get anything done.  If any of our friends and our fans know these people at the chair factory on Bowery Street,  maybe you have a friend that works there.  Maybe you could get an answer.  Maybe you can get an answer because you know somebody that works there.  Right.  But I am, I told them, look, I don't just please, I just want an honest answer. 
[02:42:30]  And, well, you've got to do what you've got to do.  That's what he tells me.  There's an answer.  That's that.  I'm going to go on the air with this.  You've got to do what you've got to do.  You've got to do what you've got to do.  There's Karen about your company.  Unbelievable.  There you go.  Dude.  You did what you've got to did.  I did what I had to did.  And I really am begging for anybody with any knowledge of the chair factory on Bowery Street  to please, maybe you could talk to the person you know there.  The Chair Factory.  Where are we?  That would take a break.  I have to take a break. 
[02:43:00]  Dude, it's one of those things, like we've all dealt with, it's being lied to.  Dude, that drives me crazy.  I think everyone can relate.  I think every single person listening can relate.  Yeah.  Something is going on.  There's something going on.  Customer service and manners and not giving a shit after they make the sale.  Once that sale is made, goodbye, good luck.  That's why I reached the point with my furniture where I actually, you know, I had it.  It was delivered.  It was in my house.  And I said, take this shit, put it back in the truck.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  And, you know, it is effective to threaten that you will talk about the place because I 
[02:43:30]  had a little situation on my vacation.  I said, I just want to let you know I'm not happy and I got a talk show.  Next thing you know, I got dessert delivered to my room and a little alky hall and a little  dinner thing.  They bent over backwards.  Well, these people hung up on me when I told them that.  That's how much respect they had for the radio show.  Well, got to do what you guys do.  I just casually said it and they understood.  I was at a really, really nice resort and my lights just decided not to work in the bathroom. 
[02:44:00]  Just decided as we're trying to get ready for dinner and stuff.  Yeah, you're pissed on the floor.  Really, really a pain in the ass.  And their thing was, well, we'll send up candles.  Candles?  Because they didn't know what was wrong with the room.  I'm like, and then they suggested maybe move in the room.  Like, look, we're in day eight here.  My stuff, I don't know about you, is everywhere.  I'm not going to start packing up just to move to another room for one or two more nights.  So I told them I was unhappy.  I told them I had a talk show and they were like, all right, all right. 
[02:44:30]  And then the next day, I'm in the middle of brushing my teeth and I have a mouthful of toothpaste and the water decides at that moment it doesn't need to work anymore.  So I call up.  I'm like, look, I just lost my mind.  Where were you, huh?  What chain?  I'm going to say, because honestly, they did the right thing and it was a gorgeous place and it was just one of those things that happens.  And to be honest, they took care of it when I said how unhappy I was.  And I did say, look, I just want to let you know I do have a talk show and I do talk about what happens in my life. 
[02:45:00]  Next thing you know, man, everything was taken care of while we were out of the room and this was sent and this was done.  Hey, hey, at least with bad things happening, you could feel happy.  Ellen's dancing.  That's cool.  All right.  See, smile on your face.  You instantly have to smile.  I might as well dance, too, because that's how I have to fucking eat standing.  Yeah, that's that's all those arrogant motherfuckers, arrogant motherfuckers. 
[02:45:30]  Is that another furniture store?  It should be arrogant.  It'd be better than the ones I've been dealing with where they were really on top of things.  And the sales guy was actually nice.  It's not him.  It's the fucking customer service is a disgrace.  And she's like, that's what the warehouse does to us all the time.  Yeah.  Well, tough shit.  Customer service people, you're calling these days and it's just you're the asshole fucking up their day.  That's what it is.  They don't care, man.  They don't give a fuck.  Everyone gets shit on by companies.  We all do.  And when they fuck with me, it's so nice to be able to strike back publicly. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, no shit.  That's what I love about this radio show, that we can at least vent about this shit that happens to every person out there.  We have this forum, thank God.  Because I had thought about that.  I'm like, what would I do?  At least when you vent on the air, you feel a little better about it, you know?  Can you imagine, you know, a guy that doesn't have his radio show, the same shit happens.  There's nothing he can do.  I'm not even going to mention the fact that I had to drive the SRX in today.  Because when my Escalade is left for a week without being started, the battery is completely dead. 
[02:46:30]  I've taken it in.  I've had it repaired.  But the only problem is when they repair it, when is the next time I'm not going to drive it for a week?  Six months, a year down the road.  It's nothing that can be diagnosed.  We're going to hold your car for a week and see if it's broken still.  So they said they fixed it.  It's not fixed.  It's sitting in my garage, dead as a doornail.  You've had a couple little problems with that thing.  I love the way it drives. 
[02:47:00]  I love the car.  They're making me have a problem with it, you know?  So I won't even mention the fact that my Caddy Escalade is sitting in my garage with a dead battery again.  You guys got the biggest problem that you still think that customer service could do something for you.  No.  I've given up on that.  No, you know what my customer service is going to be?  I have given up.  Jumper cables.  I'm going to buy them on the way home and jump it like it's a fucking 65 Nova that I used to own.  And that's going to be it.  I do still call customer service when I just feel like battling. 
[02:47:30]  When I feel like just getting into a little thing.  Sometimes you want to, yeah.  But calling and thinking that something actually is going to be taken care of, forget it.  No way.  He got behind me on the plane on a cell phone right up until they shut the door with customer service to somebody.  And we were laughing because it was just he was getting nowhere.  And he goes, and you're, so I need to talk to another supervisor.  No, there's got to be another supervisor over you.  That's who I want to talk to.  I want to talk to your boss.  Oh, now you're going to hang up on me?  So you're saying the option is you're hanging up on me. 
[02:48:00]  It was great to listen to.  That would be the greatest website ever if they just post the audio of people losing their minds.  Oh, yeah.  Talk to customer service.  Is it really customer service when the phone call starts with a recorded voice with menu selections?  Is it really customer service?  I really need to talk to somebody.  This can't be solved through pushing buttons.  We didn't understand your request.  Oh, how much does that piss you off?  And you're like, I talk for a living.  I have good diction.  If the problem is with billing, say yes.  Yes. 
[02:48:30]  Okay.  They try to sound all up.  Okay.  Got that.  Is your problem with billing on the phone or is it with your digital service?  I don't know that option.  Okay.  No, it's not okay.  No.  You say something like that and they'll go, no.  Well, I'm sorry.  I did not understand your response.  It's something different than what you're saying. 
[02:49:00]  I did not understand your...  It's something...  I did not understand your response.  Please say yes or no.  It can't be answered in yes or no.  You're really freaking me out.  Or you say...  Okay.  Fuckers.  Or you say a simple yes and it's misunderstood for another option.  Oh.  Takes you a whole other menu.  Okay.  You want to talk to a doctor.  No.  No.  What?  No.  No.  This was about the other thing. 
[02:49:30]  How do I go back?  I left Sprint recently, like two weeks ago, because I went in and my problem...  And this is where the listeners are great.  When you have a problem, that's who you talk to and somebody emails you the right answer.  I had Palm Pilot software.  I wanted to go to Windows for this new phone.  I go into Sprint and the dumb motherfucker working there goes, no, there's no compatible  software.  Let me check out my tech.  No, you're going to have to enter it by hand.  No.  I'm like, look, I have 500 numbers in here.  I'm not going to enter them by hand.  He's like, well, then you got to stick with Palm.  Do I?  Shit, dick. 
[02:50:00]  I get home, fucking listener emails.  No, the Palm software comes with this.  It syncs it right into Outlook.  I fucking listen to the listener right into Outlook.  So Sprint, your dickhead customer service in person cost you a customer.  Because you stink.  You don't know what the fuck you're talking about with your new faggity yellow colors.  Do you like the new look?  No.  It looks like hepatitis with bad reception.  Assholes.  By hand.  It's 2006.  They put shimp hearts in people. 
[02:50:30]  But I have to enter everyone by hand because fucking Palm doesn't sync with Outlook, you  cocksucker.  Maybe if I was something like you, sir, I can enter by hand and toes and do the operation  twice.  Fucking dope.  Cost you a customer sprint.  Yeah, you and your merge with Nextel.  Go fuck yourselves.  Both of you.  Wow.  Wow, wow, wow.  Chair factory.  Bowery Street.  Bluck.  Bluck.  I second that.  Bluck.  Someone in PalTalk probably has that number and maybe you could help. 
[02:51:00]  I'm certain they do.  Hey, the Rackin' Tour show.  You're going, right, bro?  Yeah, I am going to go.  Who's that guy?  He's a listener.  We said just show up at the station.  We'll give out passes.  How many more passes can we give out?  We've got a couple more.  A couple more passes.  You just show up at the station.  We can only bring like ten listeners and a guest.  Uh-huh.  A guest each, I guess.  It's a show for 20 people.  Yeah.  And I'm going to interview.  It's Jack White's new band from White Stripes.  It's going to be really cool.  We interview them a little bit.  They're going to play five or six songs for us and like 20 of us. 
[02:51:30]  That's it.  That's it.  At the 8th factory in New York City tonight.  We're going to have a great time.  All you have to do is just show up at the station and we'll give out the passes.  We have six more to give out, Ben?  Three pairs.  Three pairs to give away?  Yeah.  How many people showed up?  A bunch.  Oh, that's cool.  All right.  Just show up.  And we've got three more passes to give away for the show tonight with Jack White's brand new  band, The Rackin' Tours.  All right.  Coat.  We're 111 West 57th Street between 6th and 7th Avenue. 
[02:52:00]  There you go.  6th and 7th Avenue.  The virus is ready.  The virus is inside us.  OAVirus.com.  Assault the media.  It's time to drop bombs.  We're just past.

The Opie and Anthony Show is returning to Boston this month for a special Marathon Monday broadcast. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, it's hilarious.  Join Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and the O&A Show crew Monday, April 17th for a live broadcast from Bill's Bar on Lansdowne Street.  Special guests to be announced.  The celebration will commence promptly at 8 o'clock in the morning and continue until the beginning of the 11th hour anti-meridium.  No, Steve.  I'm not going to say fantastic.

[02:53:30]  See, Fan?  And Travis is a team player.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  Thanks for joining us today.  We appreciate that.  So, um, I saw something before we went on break that really pissed me off. 
[02:54:00]  It's been a big venting show today, huh?  That's a vent.  Holy crap.  And this thing, Anthony.  It's on TV right now, so we should talk about it.  Yep.  Look, this is American Hall, and I get that, but why?  What is it?  It's the trailer for the new movie Flight 93, and I guess a lot of movie theaters are pulling  the trailer because it's so out.  Now, it is just making people, like, leave the theater. 
[02:54:30]  They're so upset.  Here's the deal.  I saw it on Drudge.  I saw the story last night.  So I punch it up.  I read about it, and I go to a movie trailer site because I, you know, want to see myself.  And, uh, I'm watching it, and there's just something about, something about it that I  don't, I don't mind that the movie's made at all.  You know, that's fine.  Make the movie and everything.  It's something about it that is too disturbing for me, I guess. 
[02:55:00]  It's going to be like, I think this whole generation is fucked as far as movies or watching the  news clips of it anymore.  You know, it just, it brings you right back, and I don't think it's like, oh, too soon?  I don't think it matters how much time.  30 years can go by.  You'll still look at film clips and go, oh, fuck.  I remember that, like, so vividly.  It's going to be one of those things where it's going to take a whole other generation that 
[02:55:30]  wasn't there to go, you know, why is Grandpa so emotional over that whole thing?  Why, you know, it's one of those things, like Pearl Harbor was, uh, just one of those  things.  So, when I watched the trailer, it's like, it pissed me off.  It, like, uh, it, it brings you right back to that moment again, and the same emotion,  you know?  You're sad, you're pissed, and it's like so, um, look at it, like we're watching parts of 
[02:56:00]  it now, and it's so, there's just a guy getting on a plane.  It looks like he just made it in.  He just made it.  And it's like, I made it, and he's like, oh, thank God I made it.  You've been on that, how many times have you been on that flight, you know?  You're looking, you're just hanging out, you're sitting there, and then the savages jump up,  and, and, and it's so, eh, you know how it ends.  I mean, it's, you know, it's not going to be some, uh, ending that's any different than  what happened.  That is bullshit.  That's what pisses me off.  We expect that some moviegoers will have a strong response to its images and narrative.  The, the film get, ah, ah, they went too quickly. 
[02:56:30]  I, uh, they went to split screen, but that's what I was going to ask.  Universal, like, what, what's their excuse for, uh, putting out this movie?  Because it's, it's about making money.  Come on.  It is.  Of course.  Come on.  Any movie, you're not going to want to make money.  Any movie is.  Are they really going to spin it and say this, you know, what are they, what are they spinning  this as?  I don't think it's spinning it.  I think it's, it's sort of a docudrama of what happened on that flight.  Which isn't a bad thing. 
[02:57:00]  They make movies all the time about disasters and stuff.  Could you find the statement that they just had on, it must be on a website somewhere  because, see it over there.  It's just the fact that movie theaters are pulling this and meanwhile they'll show some  fucking dog shit trailer for some garbage movie.  I love the fact that they're making this because let people get angry again.  Let people see these fucking savage motherfuckers and the way they behave and the way they  fucking slaughtered 3,000 people.  Right, right, right.  It won't change anything.  I get all that.  I just want to know how Universal is spinning this because in the end it's to make money. 
[02:57:30]  It's a, well, yeah.  Any movie is going to make money.  But I saw the statement and they're kind of saying, well, so they could confront the  feelings they had.  No, shut up.  Oh, really?  Just say, look, this is a hot topic and we want to now exploit this.  I don't think they could say that.  I understand.  But don't fucking insult my intelligence and say it's something else.  You don't think, okay, all right.  We're going to see a million of these fucking movies now.  Devil's Advocate.  Some of them going to be purely for money.  Just say, look, don't say anything.  Don't fucking insult my intelligence and say that this is so you can confront the feelings 
[02:58:00]  you had that day.  Shut up.  Understandable.  Let me get the entire statement so we can read it.  Look at me like they were defending themselves.  That's all I'm saying.  Look at me like they were defending themselves.  Obviously, you want to make money.  But isn't there a way to have some artistic integrity in making a movie like this where  you are showing, hey, based on all the information we got, you're never going to get a fucking  video of what happened that day.  This is what happened. 
[02:58:30]  This is the emotions that they were feeling based on phone calls and families, phone calls.  So, and it says it's the first film about 9-11.  And you know how this...  Oh, they'll pump them out.  Some are going to be dreck.  Eventually, it's going to be one starring Rob Schneider.  Great.  This is how this is going to end.  They start out with like a little respect and then it's like, oh, great.  Victims' families did give their permission for this one.  We have to see another Rob Schneider film because he's friends with Adam Sandler. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, can't wait.  Sorry for the tangent, but...  There should...  I mean, movies like this, sure, there's no problem making them.  Like I said before, I'm sure there are people with some integrity that are making these things.  They don't want to lose money.  Obviously, you want it to be a hit.  You want it to be seen by a lot of people.  And in turn, it makes a lot of money.  But it's very hard to watch it, even the trailer. 
[02:59:30]  Like they were saying, they pulled the trailer because some people walk in there unexpectedly.  There was some woman, sits down.  She goes there to see whatever movie.  All of a sudden, the trailer comes on.  And from the trailer, you can't tell immediately what it's even about.  You're watching going, all right, this could be anything.  And then you go, oh boy.  And by the time you know what it's about, an image has already hit you.  You're already feeling the emotion.  Then maybe you don't want to fucking feel going to a movie that day. 
[03:00:00]  I'm not saying pulling the trailer is the right thing.  I don't know.  Maybe they should say that there's going to be a trailer for a 9-11 movie during this show.  They have every right to show the trailers.  Absolutely.  Maybe people should fucking stop expecting nothing but fluff in movies.  I mean, look, I understand there's a weird line, 9-11 is an awful issue.  But it's a film about it, which I'm sure will deal with it with dignity.  I'm sure it's not going to be a douchey film.  So you got it in the trailers.  I mean, I don't know.  How much hand? 
[03:00:30]  Like, are people that easily upset that they're going to walk out of the theaters and go home that night?  Because they saw a trailer for a film?  Some people are.  And with this subject, I watched a fucking trailer last night that really showed no graphic images of anything.  It really didn't.  And it was upsetting.  It was upsetting to watch the trailer.  No fucking graphic.  For a split second, you saw the towers on fire.  That's it in the trailer.  The rest of it is people on planes, the captain, you know, looking down and going, oh, my God, look at that. 
[03:01:00]  Two planes went into the tower?  What's that all about?  And he's the frigging captain on a plane that this is going to happen.  The savages sitting there looking around, jumping up.  They still didn't lock the door on that cockpit.  Oh, there was blatant stupidity in hindsight.  It's all that stuff.  But you know how it ends.  They don't land.  They don't get off and smile and go, boy, we beat them.  You know, it's that day that we all fucking remember. 
[03:01:30]  And it's one of those rare movies that doesn't have the Hollywood ending.  No.  Where everything works out okay.  No, it doesn't.  I mean, you hope.  Not many movies end tragically.  Well, it depends on where you show it.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm sure they'll spin this movie somehow where it'll have some kind of a Hollywood ending.  Well, you know what the Hollywood ending will be?  The unconfirmed thing that they brought the plane down.  No one really knows what the ending is.  And I'm sure they'll portray it as them being heroes and taking over the cockpit and crashing the plane instead of it going into a designated target. 
[03:02:00]  That's as Hollywood an ending as you're going to get at it.  That's it.  And there's still people.  And we had one guy on one time.  And I am putting out an open call if anybody has.  There are still 9-11 conspiracy buffs that think that the government was involved, that it didn't happen.  And it's almost embarrassing, like, how awful your conspiracy theories are.  It's like, stop rebelling against mommy and daddy, which the government to you represents mommy and daddy, and you want to be different. 
[03:02:30]  I'm sure the government, look, they're full of scumbags.  And if you said somebody knew 9-11 was coming and they looked the other way to start a war, maybe.  I mean, a lot of people thought Hoover knew that fucking the Pearl Harbor bombing was coming.  But to think that the government actually hooked up a plane, I've seen video where they zoom in.  They say, see the explosion right there?  There's a bomb on the bottom of this plane.  No, there's not, you fucking dumb motherfuckers, idiot.  Can somebody who knows about this conspiracy that believes it, please, I promise, we'll let you talk. 
[03:03:00]  I honestly want to hear.  It's so ridiculous.  Like, when you hear moon landing people, they're on a moon landing, never happened.  They make valid arguments, but then you hear NASA's explanation.  You're like, oh, okay.  They're all disproving.  I definitely understand at least why you thought that, even though it's bullshit.  That's what I want to know.  The only thing about this movie that I think is good is it's the only movie you're going to see these days  that show these Muslim scumbags as the terrorist, violent, evil people that they are, 
[03:03:30]  instead of the, ooh, the German terrorist or the South American guy.  You know, they can't make an accurate movie these days with terrorists in it because they won't use,  they don't want to upset these Muslims.  Yeah, what was the movie that came out?  Oh, that was, uh, that was right after.  Well, there's also a, uh.  Schwarzenegger.  Yeah, they'll, they'll show, uh, uh, uh, flight 93.  Oh, who's the hijacker? 
[03:04:00]  It's Hans Gruber.  Look, there he is trying to get into the cockpit.  With the Schwarzenegger movie, I gotta say, in fairness, I think was made before 9-11 and they,  and they held it.  I'm almost positive that that was made before 9-11.  Yeah.  But they changed the terrorist.  There was another movie that came out and we had a whole discussion with it.  They changed that whole fucking movie.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah, they changed the terrorist where he was a Middle Eastern guy and they changed  him to something else.  Collateral Damage.  Um.  That was the one.  I, I, I see my movie.  Has anybody.  Wonderful Collateral Damage. 
[03:04:30]  I, my name is Mick Jones in it.  What was his stupid American name in that one?  Big Cam.  Hey, what's up?  Hold on, hold on, Big Cam.  Has anybody seen, uh, the, uh, goddammit, I lost my thought, the fucking.  Ah, shit.  No, no, no.  Ice Age, it was terrific.  No, no, no, no.  It's about, uh, Schwarzenegger.  Oh, the, the Showtime special, the Showtime series about terrorism.  I want to buy it just to throw it in somebody's teeth.  Cause it looks like politically correct.  It's about the, the, the cell. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah.  Where they show a white guy, a black guy, a white woman and a white, and an Arab woman.  Like, you know, cause that's what terrorist cells are.  They're multicultural.  Right.  Multicultural.  Yeah.  That was pretty good, Jim.  But is that, dude, is, is that an accurate portrayal?  Cause I have not seen it.  Well, I've, I've never been involved in a terrorist cell.  No, no, no.  What I'm saying is that an accurate portrayal of that show.  I haven't seen it.  Well, I just said.  I saw, I saw, I saw it.  Is it politically correct, Drek?  Yeah.  Yeah, it looks to me from, I saw an episode that it is, uh, like a white guy that's disillusioned 
[03:05:30]  with the country and a black guy and an Arab guy.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Okay.  And it's like, it's such a load of bullshit.  Why don't we just show them what they are?  They're Muslim extremist, uh, uh, Arab terrorists.  And you get the occasional black guy or white guy mixed up in there who's an extremist, but  it's never going to be a hundred percent, but you know, it's 95% or more 99% Arabic males  or Arabic looking males.  Yeah.  That's who's involved in Muslim extremism. 
[03:06:00]  And unfortunately a movie like flight 93 is pretty much the only time you're going to  see that in a movie because that's how it happened.  And I'm surprised they haven't, you know, tried to change it already and make them Asian.  And from the New York times website, universal will not pull United 93 trailer by criticism.  Good.  They shouldn't.  Collateral damage.  My name was Gordy Brewer.  Ill.  Gordy?  Hi, I'm Gordy Brewer.  Gordon, uh, Jordan Brewer.  An Oliver Stone's movie, uh, is coming out in August, right? 
[03:06:30]  Another 9-11 film.  August.  Yeah.  They made the movie already.  Yeah, because we know this movie basically was on A&E.  It was on A&E.  It was on A&E already.  Yeah.  Made for TV.  It was one of the highest rated, uh, A&E movies ever.  And, uh, it didn't look like this one.  And it looks like it goes into a little more detail in the peripheral things that were happening.  Like, I think the one from A&E was more, uh, constrained to what was happening on the plane.  Didn't they have actual recordings, too, that they played, like, as part of it?  Like, real, real phone call recordings?  Did they?  In the movie? 
[03:07:00]  I thought they did.  I could be wrong.  I don't know if they were real or not.  I don't know if they did that.  It seemed to me the one on A&E was about the little stories that you heard about the one guy who reached a phone operator.  Yeah, yeah.  It was more on plane.  This is kind of, it has a lot more peripheral about what was going on, um, in, uh, as far as the Air Force was concerned and things like that.  Yeah.  What guy that reached an operator?  I'm not sure what you mean.  There, there, there are little stories, uh, you know, about what, what the, the, the A&E film seemed to focus more, at least from what I saw of it, it seemed to focus more on, uh, what, what the little family stories were going through. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah, people got through on phones, you know, they were talking to, uh, 911 operators, operators, uh, their family, leaving messages on answering machines, stuff like that.  Right, this one mother and daughter were talking the entire time, and, uh, you know, it seemed to focus on the phone.  It's more on those little stories rather than the event in total.  Yeah.  You think that, you think some of these phone calls, uh, went right to the end, too? 
[03:08:00]  I'm sure.  Yeah.  Could you imagine?  They just released, they just released a bunch of 911 calls, um.  The one-sided conversations?  Yeah, the one-sided conversations.  All around the break?  Those were creepy as well.  Just, all you heard were the 911 operators.  They didn't add the people.  Why?  It's some kind of respect of this, but it's the Freedom of, of, of, of, of Information Act that made them release what they did release.  But, for some reason, they're still fighting to get the other side of it.  You hear them breathing heavy.  You hear certain sounds in the background. 
[03:08:30]  And you hear the turmoil going on at 911.  They're getting, you know, massive amounts of these calls.  Uh, giving out information to people that say, well, I'm on the 100th floor.  I got 90 people with me.  What do we do?  And they're like, well, just sit tight.  Someone will be there.  And, uh, other people telling people to get out.  You know, no one really knew what, what to do.  Again, in hindsight.  I think, actually, in the Oliver Stone movie that's coming out, they actually, uh, uh, they go into a lot of, uh, of those kind of, I guess, mistakes, for lack of a better word. 
[03:09:00]  And not really mistakes, because unless you have something to go off of, you know.  That was pretty much, as a 911 operator that doesn't know the gravity of the situation, wouldn't you say, the firemen are all there.  Believe me, we sent them all out.  Stay where you are.  Don't make it more confusing for them.  Not like, hmm, I'm a 911 operator, and I think the buildings are going to fall down.  You better, uh, get out of there, you know.  Well, I mean, those decisions, like the, uh, the, telling the people to come out of the one building or to go back up because everything was okay.  Well, just like Charlie Sheen coming out saying, now this dummy fucking shit movie maker, I think it was controlled explosions. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah, do ya?  Stupid.  Do ya?  Yeah.  That's right.  They wired, they wired a building for a demolition without anyone knowing.  And if I hear one more person go, listen to me, the Kennedy assassination was pulled off, and there were video cameras there.  That is 43 fucking years ago.  43 years ago, and, and they, and, and we, and we know it's a conspiracy. 
[03:10:00]  Do you understand what I'm saying?  Like, to think that you could pull something like that off now, and, and the only way they get away with it is because fucking Ruby shot Oswald on television.  Do you think you could put something together, and if I hear the bigger the lie, the more likely people ought to believe it.  We know that quote, assholes.  To put together a conspiracy of this magnitude, where are the people?  If this was a controlled plane that flew into Tower One, where are the people?  Where are these recordings coming from?  Do you know that they are actually.  Why am I shouting?  There are actually conspiracy theorists that say that it was one of those controlled demolition explosions. 
[03:10:30]  Like when they take a building down.  Did you ever see what goes into taking a building down?  The, the engineering.  Yes.  To destroy a building.  How they plant the explosives.  There are actually, um, they use, uh, uh, pressurized cables to pull the beams in as they're exploding.  So you can't just, as people are typing in their office, some guy comes in with a four-foot ladder and some explosives and goes, oh, don't mind me. 
[03:11:00]  I'm working on the phones.  Ma'am, your light's out, so I'm just putting some C4 in here.  And who are the guys in this, how, for two 110-story buildings, was one guy doing all the explosive installation over a four-year period?  It would be the hugest undertaking ever.  You want to hear what Charlie Sheen has to say exactly?  Oh, is he a dupid?  Charlie Sheen says.  I was up early and we were going to do a pre-shoot on Spin City, the show I used to do. 
[03:11:30]  I was watching the news.  And the North Tower was burning.  I saw the South Tower hit live.  The, uh, famous wide shot where it disappears behind the building and then we see the tremendous fireball.  There was a feeling it just didn't look any, uh, it's not right.  There was a feeling it just didn't look any commercial jetliner I've flown on any time in my life.  You could tell that watching like that, Chuck, could you?  And then when the buildings came down later on that day, I said to my brother, call me insane, but did it sort of look like those buildings came down in a controlled demolition? 
[03:12:00]  Yes, it did.  Because of the way they were, uh, I saw a whole special on how they did it.  There was something about they should have reinforced it.  Oh, fire never brings down metal.  Yes, it does.  When all the fucking, uh, the stuff gets blown off because of the explosion.  There was no insulation.  Jet fuel burns in water.  And then when you have slabs of concrete falling like flapjacks on top of each other, it's going to go down.  It's the path of least resistance.  If, if, if one floor falls on another, on another, on another, what's going to make it tip over? 
[03:12:30]  Uh, nothing.  It's just going to keep doing it.  And that's what it did.  And then Sheen goes on.  Sheen said that most people.  Sheen's an idiot.  Most people's gutted family.  The Sean Penn School of Politics.  Sheen said that most people's gut instinct that the buildings had been deliberately employed was washed away by the incessant flood of the official version of events from day one.  That was no one's fucking gut instinct, you fucking mediocre filmmaking shitbox.  Nobody thought that. 
[03:13:00]  We thought, wow, savages, we knew who did it.  We knew what religion they were before it was announced.  Flew planes into the buildings.  We knew what happened.  Who would rather blame the government, their own government, than, than when the proof is there that these savages did it?  Who cares?  I don't care if you like Bush.  Bush is an idiot.  We all know.  Okay.  Uh, he's a, he's a, he's a jerk off.  But, we know who did this.  It wasn't our government.  It wasn't Bush.  It was the savages that hate us.  Somebody raised a good point. 
[03:13:30]  Like, people who believe that, and look, I'm not saying the government is not capable of being garbage or starting wars for shitty motors.  Believe me, they're, they're shit.  I don't think our government is fucking all apple pie.  If you want to see a good government operation right there, look at the Waco tapes.  There's the government doing some dirty work.  That's the government doing dirty work.  Here's what the government really is.  It's the chair factory on Bowery Street with a lot more people.  Fucking, um, so I'm not, I'm not naive about what the government is saying that there are, but people, someone said that people need to believe that our government allowed that to happen or created it to happen. 
[03:14:00]  Because it still gives you an element of safety in a weird way and control.  Right.  Like, we weren't just blindsided by this.  Yeah, this didn't have happened, right?  We knew we could have stopped it.  No, we couldn't have.  Well, we didn't.  We were screwed by the weaker team.  And, hey, look, if they said that a small faction of the upper military or government knew this was going to happen and had the data and kind of just stood back to the war, all right, hey, I'm not going to say you're completely wrong. 
[03:14:30]  Maybe you're not.  But to imply that it was, the buildings were, and I was talking to somebody about World Trade Center 7, and this is how I know, he's a conspiracy guy who just likes to be involved.  Because he went, well, you know, when WTC 7, what the fuck does that mean?  Ew.  W, who the fuck says that except a bunch of dummies in one chat room?  All right, Kev, we've got to let you go.  See ya.  All right, thank you.  WTC 7.  It's actually faster to say World Trade Center 7.  Right.  Let's talk to a New York City fireman.  Tim, real fast, because we're going to move on to something else before we get out of here. 
[03:15:00]  How you doing all bad, Jim?  What's going on?  Hi, Tim.  Listen, these fucking assholes, I was down there.  They've got to be shitting me.  Two big buildings, two big planes were flown into the fucking buildings.  Thank God they came straight down and they didn't go over.  Otherwise, you'd be dealing with tens of thousands of people dead.  I'm so sick and tired of these assholes, and they all fucking forgot.  They all forgot what the hell went on.  I'm just, I lost at least 50, 60 friends, plus 343 of the brothers went down that day. 
[03:15:30]  And these people are fucking assholes.  Just look at the films.  The pictures of these people coming out of the buildings.  These are the same assholes that are talking this way now.  It really is mind-boggling.  These fucking Martin Sheeans, and they think he thinks he's the president of the United States, for Christ's sake.  That fucking show he does.  Well, did Martin Sheeans say anything like this?  I know it's just Charlie.  Martin Sheeans got his own, like...  Well, Martin Sheeans, he gets speeches now, and he thinks he's the fucking president because of that stupid-ass show he does.  He's a jerk-off.  People allow their distrust, legitimate distrust of the government, to interfere with any type of common sense. 
[03:16:00]  And it's like, you know what, guys?  Sometimes the U.S. isn't wrong.  There are times when shit does happen to us that's bad.  Yeah.  It's not always our fault.  Right.  Well, let's move on to one last thing here.  All righty.  Well, it's just our observation.  Our theory's coming true about bands in general.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  We'll talk more about this... 
[03:16:30]  Yeah, as the week goes on.  ...as the week goes on.  I don't know.  It'd be a rough one to see.  You gonna see it?  You gonna see that movie?  No.  I don't think I'd be able to sit through it in the theater.  Not out of self-righteous reasons.  It's just upsetting.  It probably won't make that much money because it's very upsetting.  I'll watch it at home.  If I could sit through Passion of the Christ...  No.  See?  That's too long ago.  Oh, my God.  It was still just ridiculously more than I.  You can't get enough.  Jesus is always shown hanging up.  Every time you see Jesus, he's fucking miserable.  I've never seen Passion of the Christ.  Never happy and dancing. 
[03:17:00]  Have you seen Passion of the Christ?  I actually thought that as a movie, it was average.  Did you really see it?  Yes.  Of course.  I bought it because I thought the beating scenes and shit were so well shot.  I love the brutality in that because that's probably the way it happened.  So I did respect Gibson for showing that.  Hollywood hated this fucking movie.  Yeah, yeah.  And there are certain elements of Hollywood that hated the fact that he made it the way he did.  So I kind of liked the fact that he did it.  Ouch.  It was just like, holy crap, I get it.  You see?  I get it.  I don't need to...  I know.  You see Hostel?  I don't be showing anymore. 
[03:17:30]  No.  I saw that over the weekend in the hotel room.  That's pretty violent.  Pretty good.  Just for the sake of killing.  I saw Ice Age.  Aw, that's cute.  What the squirrel does with the acorn.  It's just terrific.  Isn't it?  It's just terrific.  It's the ice crack and he falls in again.  So good.  Wait, did one of you guys recommend a movie that I was going to kill you for?  I don't remember.  History of Violence?  I bought that, but I haven't seen it yet.  Um...  I saw Capote.  Now I'm scared.  Oh no.  I saw Capote.  I fucking loved Hoffman. 
[03:18:00]  I loved it.  Wasn't he amazing?  Dude, he definitely deserved that.  He didn't realize how good a job he did that they started showing old footage of Truman  Capote on the talk shows.  You're like, he freaking nailed that guy's persona.  And he not only did the impression of Capote, but as an actor, he just, he was, the emotion  was there and all the shit that actors have to do, allegedly, before I've heard, he did.  He was just amazing.  I'm trying to remember one movie we suggested.  I don't remember.  It might have been, uh...  Oh, uh, Walk the Line, you hated. 
[03:18:30]  That was, it was after that, I think, while we were on break.  He looks great in that, uh, Mission Impossible 3, uh, trailer.  Yeah, he's like the, the villain.  Well, I heard Cruise really wanted him for that, um, and scheduling conflicts and shit,  and they finally got him for it.  Yeah, he does a great job.  He's great.  This is, I mean, changing gears in a ridiculous way, I understand, but, uh, before vacation,  I was, uh, doing a little DVR, and I'd tape all, uh, all sorts of stuff,  and then I'd go, ah, let me see what's going on, and I...  Eh, and with the talk shows, I can't, I can't be bothered.  I love, um, watching Leno's monologue, and sometimes I love seeing Dave do some of his 
[03:19:00]  silly things, and then I'd look to see what guests are on and stuff, you know, and go,  oh, wow, I like that guy from The Office.  I'm gonna check out the interview on Leno or whatever.  So, I noticed that, uh, Leno had the cars on, so I'm like, oh my god, little known fact  about me, and probably Ann, too, when we were growing up, I loved the cars.  Yeah, I was a cars fan.  Not, like, severe, but I kind of liked them.  I really liked the cars, especially their first album and stuff, you know.  That's not a bad one to like, Jim.  They were different.  I didn't like them growing up.  They were different.  They were, like, the first of the real, like, the popular new wave bands. 
[03:19:30]  Right.  That came out, where it was that weird sound, like, uh, you know, that new wave sound.  What was the big car song?  I mean, I remember not liking them.  Like, The Good Times Roll, Bye Bye Love.  I mean, it goes on and on and on.  I know they were very popular.  I loathed them.  Drive.  I don't know that one.  It was a really different sound for the time, though.  Let the good times roll.  Yeah.  It's not that bad, Jimmy.  Oof.  It was, it's, it's pop.  It's pop rock.  So, uh. 
[03:20:00]  Blinding Me With Science is good.  And Thomas Dolby.  Thomas Dolby.  Thomas Dolby.  It's terrific.  One of my submarines is missing.  That was a follow-up hit.  And I'll plead on the way over, who wasn't listening to Flock of Seagulls, Hand Up.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Right.  Space Age love song?  Or did you go with Iran?  Iran is the only one I have.  Space Age love song.  I actually thought it was called Iran.  I thought it was about the country.  So, I'm like, ah, the car's on Jay Leno.  Let me see what they're about.  Yeah.  A lot of these bands that we grew up with have decided to come back and, uh, and start touring 
[03:20:30]  again.  It's the, it's the, it's all the rage out there.  All the rage.  So, I'm like, all right, let's, uh, let's take a look.  This is, uh, so this is the audio of, uh, Jay Leno intro on the cars, and then I'll  get into my severe problem, right?  My next guests are part of a legendary rock band known as the Cars.  They recently reformed with a mixture of old and new members, have a new CD.  It's Alive.  Their road rage short kicks off May 12th.  Please welcome the new Cars.  I'm like, all right.  And I hear that tonight. 
[03:21:00]  Oh, my God.  All right.  Yeah.  Finally.  This is pretty cool, right?  When was the last time you saw the live car?  Hold on.  What?  Wait a minute.  What?  Oh, wait, wait.  So, at this point, I look at the TV, I'm like, sounds like Rick Ocasek.  A little.  A little.  Let me, let me see how he looks these days.  And I finally look at the TV.  I'm like, Todd fucking Rundgren?  Is that Todd Rundgren?  Todd Rundgren. 
[03:21:30]  Fucking Rundgren.  Todd Rundgren.  Is now the new lead singer of the Cars.  I'm like, why did Jay Leno book this crap?  Oh, Leno didn't.  Somebody other.  It's a cover band with Todd Rundgren.  This is Todd Rundgren?  It's Todd Rundgren.  Do you have any respect for the business you're in, you fucking idiot?  Todd Rundgren decided to put together a tribute band.  And this is it.  A Cars tribute band.  So, I got an announcement. 
[03:22:00]  Anthony and I are forming a band.  Yes.  It's going to be called The New Led Zeppelin.  We are The New Led Zeppelin.  Why not?  Why not?  Why not?  Anthony's been in bands all these years.  Why not?  It doesn't seem like you need anybody, really, that was in the band.  Let them rush.  You're rocking, oh, hey, let the signs roll.  You know what makes me sick about this?  Please tell me it enrages you.  That fucking Todd Rundgren comes up and tells me how he didn't like Tough Crowd. 
[03:22:30]  A bunch of comics being honest and telling the truth.  Sorry, cocksucker, we weren't doing a fucking cover song.  You fucking, you fucking wispy-haired shitbag.  I didn't, Todd Rundgren, you met him?  I had a fucking argument with him.  You did?  At the CES.  In Vegas.  In Vegas.  We're all in the same bar as him.  He came up to me and he goes, wait a minute, you were on that awful show and he was kind  of being funny and I'm like, it's going to get ugly.  So I got my picture quick and then he was talking about Tough Crowd and how it didn't  always hit the mark. 
[03:23:00]  And I'm going, well, didn't you do live albums?  Did you record over them in the studio or did you let people see it as it was?  I'm like, it's your political ideology.  I let him have it.  Believe me.  Douchebag.  I let him have it.  You fuck you.  Shithead.  Sorry.  Maybe we should have just done old Gallagher jokes like you're doing.  He lived a lie telling Liv Tyler that he was a father for how many years?  Did he?  Yeah.  Who knows?  I wish I would have known that.  You're a liar.  I wish I would have known that.  Yes.  I should have brought that up right.  I didn't know it.  Oh, how do you have pride, man? 
[03:23:30]  How do you have pride?  How do you criticize someone else's work when you're doing that?  He's letting someone else's good times roll.  So just not even his.  Just for the people that don't really understand how bad this is, the Cars had two lead singers.  They had two lead singers.  They had Benjamin Orr, who unfortunately-  Oh, yeah.  How many did-  He sang a lot of the hits.  What did he sing?  He sang Drive, which was one of their biggest hits ever.  Which was one big hit, but that was pretty much it.  Everything else was Rico Kasich singing.  I hate the way they have fucking car themes to their songs. 
[03:24:00]  Honestly, I'm going to challenge you on that.  I'll do some more tonight.  All right, a challenge?  Benjamin Orr sang a bunch of car songs.  What other-  Well, Earl's nodding, so it must be true.  Earl, help me out here.  Earl will help.  Earl is the musical.  Earl knows all.  Let this handsome, beautiful man come in here.  Earl knows everything about music.  Earl-  Hello, Earl.  Earl, we're on vacation for 11 days, and we're almost as dark as you.  I'm so happy to hear the music that is the voice of Earl Douglas.  Earl, what are some of the hits?  He sung Let's Go. 
[03:24:30]  That was a-  Wait, wait.  He sang that one?  I'm almost-  Yeah.  Benjamin Orr?  Play that.  Yeah.  This is Let's Go.  All right.  Let me hear this.  Are you sure Benjamin Orr sang this?  Pretty sure.  Or Rick Ocasek sang this?  I say Rick Ocasek sang this.  Hold on.  I say Rundgren.  Nah, it's Benjamin Orr.  Hold on. 
[03:25:00]  All right.  All right, it is.  Uh-oh, Ben's challenging Earl's info.  Oh, I don't know.  Uh-oh.  I don't know if it is.  Now I got to do some research.  But Benjamin Orr sang more than just-  He sang Drive.  We know he sang Drive.  Drive.  That was a big one.  Rick Ocasek, though, is the voice of the Cars.  If you say who was the singer of the Cars, 99 people out of 100 are going to say-  I would absolutely agree with you, but Benjamin Orr sang some songs, that's all.  Rick Ocasek stinks.  Who's going to drive you home?  That's Benjamin Orr.  That's Benjamin Orr.  Oh, whoever sang that should be-  Have their fucking larynx cut out. 
[03:25:30]  Like fucking Hal Holbrook.  It just blurts out, it's Sabbath.  And runs out.  Look, look, look what Earl just gave Jim.  He's got all these fucking songs.  He's got his new Black Sabbath company.  My fucking-  My greatest hits.  And I adore Earl.  Thank you, Earl.  I love you.  Listen, we're running out of show, so we want to just bury this.  So, I'm watching.  I'm like, you gotta-  What's wrong with Todd Rundgren?  He needs to be famous again that bad?  Oh, he should be shot.  That he decides to agree to this project and jump on board?  He's fronting a Cars cover band.  So, Rick Ocasek was the lead singer in the Cars, yes. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  And then Benjamin Orr sang one, maybe more.  Now I gotta figure that out.  At least a couple.  But you had two singers in the Cars.  Both are gone.  Benjamin Orr died.  Of what kind of cancer, Earl?  Earl knows all.  Pancreatic cancer?  Oh, boy.  That's a bad one.  How'd you know that?  That's a big, Earl.  He's a big nose.  No, Earl really knows music.  It's unbelievable.  And then Rick Ocasek just didn't want to be in-  He doesn't want to be bothered.  No.  He's doing his thing, and he knows he did some great work with the Cars, and he's moving on. 
[03:26:30]  It's over.  But how do these bands get away with continuing without the main players?  So, who's left?  Who's left?  And I love the band, and I can only name Benjamin Orr and Rick Ocasek.  The lighting guy?  Are most of them actual gone, the original members?  Yeah.  Todd Rundgren on lead vocals.  Oh, douchebag.  He really is a douchebag.  He's a bag of douche.  He's not even a douchebag.  He's a bag that was meant to hold something else that somebody dumped douche into. 
[03:27:00]  A douchebag at least has dignity, because it is what it is.  Kind of like, well, you've watched the news.  But a bag of douche means you have a bag, and you open it, and you go, pour some douche in here.  But douche doesn't belong in here.  It could be a bag of anything.  It could be a bag of gold nuggets.  But no, it's a baggy of douche.  Can we do an experiment?  We do have the Opie and Anthony lab.  Can we actually see what a bag of douche looks like?  Please.  Yes, I can tell you what it looks like.  And then put a microphone in front of it and watch it do a Cars cover song. 
[03:27:30]  Stop dyeing your hair blonde, cocksucker.  You're 70.  Hey, when the phones explode like they're exploding right now, it could mean only one thing.  Yes.  We probably put our feet in our mouths.  Yeah, of course we did.  Eric in Colorado.  Oh, no.  You talk for everybody.  Eric, how's Dylan in Colorado?  It's going.  What's up, Eric?  Hey, I foresee a phone call from Elo, because XM is hyping this concert.  These Cars tour quite heavily.  Oh, are they really?  Good. 
[03:28:00]  Get Todd Rundgren in here.  Good.  Let's interview Todd Rundgren.  Uh-oh.  Let's ask Todd Rundgren a couple songs.  You've been hyping it on the music channel.  It's crazy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, I do not support that.  I think it stinks.  Hold on.  Let me sum it up.  Hype this.  I'm grabbing my cock and ball.  Wow.  Hype this.  So we've got a minute and a half.  This is the deal.  So original guitarist Elliot Easton's in the band, and keyboardist Greg Hawks.  And then the rhythm section is Kasem Sultan, who played in Utopia, Meatloaf, Celine Dion, 
[03:28:30]  and Hall & Oates.  Basically, he's a studio guy.  A studio musician.  And then the Tubes drummer, who is way too happy to be there.  The Tubes?  Yeah.  Oh, who the fucking cares about this band?  Just fucking put a jukebox on it.  The She's the Beauty, One in a Million Girl Tubes.  But this is something we brought up in the past, that these bands eventually will go on  without any original members, and they'll still be called the original name of the band.  And there just seems to be something wrong with that. 
[03:29:00]  Wow.  Yeah, we should be the new Led Zeppelin.  Why not?  Yeah.  Someone's got to do it.  Hey, should you plug the gig for it tonight?  Should you get another plug?  Gig.  Gig.  See how responsible I became responsible?  I hope we gave out all the tickets.  We're going to be interviewing Jack White's new band, The Rackin' Tours, at the Hit Factory  tonight.  They're going to interview, we're going to interview them for a little while, and then  they're going to play five or six songs.  It's going to be cool.  We're getting there at like 6.30, right?  We're getting there at 6.30?  And then it's going to be on XM, I don't know, down the road sometime. 
[03:29:30]  I'm actually psyched for this.  But there you go, the new cars with Todd Rundgren.  I had no shame.  Rundgren.  Sorry, tough crowd just didn't rehash fucking old Steve Martin jokes, Todd.  The nerve of us to be honest and talk openly.  Let's get Lee Abrams on the air tomorrow to explain the new cars.  I don't have an intelligent discussion about this, because I just don't get it.  It'll be a discussion.  I don't get it that he would actually say, yeah, I'll do this.  I'll do this project.  You look very handsome with your tan.  Oh, well, see you tomorrow. 
[03:30:00]  Oh, well, eh.  You can't convince me.  Program complete. </pre>
