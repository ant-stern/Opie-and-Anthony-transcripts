<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with Opie, Anthony Cumia, and Jim Norton establishing their signature brand of crude humor.  They began by complaining about the frigid New York City weather, before launching into a scathing critique of radio personality John Montone's predictable street interviews.  The conversation then shifted to comedian Bill Burr, with the hosts comparing their shared experiences of difficult childhoods and yelling parents.  They shared anecdotes about their fathers and upbringings.  This led to a discussion of a viral video showing Jim Norton being choked out by Fedor Emelianenko, a moment Norton found hilarious, particularly due to Bob Kelly's involvement and Norton’s strategic tapping out for Kelly.  The hosts promoted their upcoming Foxwoods show featuring themselves, Bill Burr, and other comedians.  Their frustrations with SiriusXM’s bureaucracy and missed opportunities for publicity, including *The Apprentice* and a Showtime special, were aired. They briefly touched upon a Joan Rivers GoDaddy Super Bowl commercial and her documentary, commenting on her relentless ambition.  A quick discussion of the Egyptian protests followed, before a humorous tangent on a failed pigeon-feeding attempt using Bobo's bread hat.  Further discussion touched on *Top Shot*, guns (including Norton's collection), *The Biggest Loser*, and a contrast with the show *Heavy*, highlighting the different approaches to weight loss.

The show continued with a discussion about morbidly obese individuals, including anecdotes about automatic pizza deliveries and a woman’s weight gain after a divorce.  This segued into a review of *Idiot Abroad*, focusing on Carl Pilkington's reactions, especially his disgust at seeing developing chicken fetuses in eggs.  Actor Nick Swardson then called in, discussing his role in *Just Go With It*, highlighting comedic moments, including a scene where Adam Sandler dared him to strip naked and perform a split in a waterfall.  Swardson also recounted his experiences with paparazzi and shared stories about awkward encounters with Alan Alda, Kevin Smith, and Barry Williams, emphasizing the challenges of celebrity friendships. He detailed his cockroach-infested Los Angeles apartment and further celebrity anecdotes.

The next segment featured a discussion of comedian Nick Swartzen and his new show, "Pretend Time," described as "filthy" and "weird," even requiring production limits on sketches involving cocaine, dildos, and blood.  The hosts highlighted Swartzen's aggressive bartering habits and his appearances on late-night television.  A phone call with Jabral, a self-described Muslim man from Canada, followed.  This conversation delved into Jabral’s struggles with attraction to women, his negative views on various ethnic groups (including Chinese, Black women, and Jewish people), his financial struggles, and his religious beliefs, even his uncertainty about the Earth's shape.  The hosts briefly interviewed Les Stroud ("Survivorman") promoting his book, "Will to Live," and played a short clip from *Inception*. Roland, a pet, was also present in the studio.

Les Stroud's interview continued, detailing anecdotes from *Survivorman*, including a near-plane crash, finding blood on a wrecked plane from a double fatality, and eating unusual foods like sago grubs and scorpions.  He explained the show’s production methods, revealing the use of multiple cameras and crew despite its solitary portrayal.  He recounted dangerous encounters with various animals, including an unidentified creature in Alaska.  The conversation covered cultural food differences, shark finning, and a rusty nail tattoo received from a tribe.  Discussions about Bigfoot, the possibility of cloning woolly mammoths, and the current zombie craze in media ensued. This was followed by a humorous calculation of the number of clits needed to fill a bathtub and other absurd measurements, along with a promotion for "American Fuckers".  Arnie Hemlin was also mentioned as a previous guest.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  Here we go, here's the bit.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, the father.  I would love to say we have the best job in America.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  It could be the best thing ever.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  Out loud laughs.  How do we explain the show?  We should start there.  Oh, here it is.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show,  a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment 
[00:00:30]  and having very few limits.  Oh, shit.  This is a freak show.  Why would anybody want to come on this show as a guest?  Under the right circumstances, something weird could happen.  I don't give a fuck.  Laugh out loud funny.  Which I love.  That's what I love.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  Because when you listen to our show, you know what you get.  You know what we are.  Everything has to do with cock or balls.  No, the jokes all end up talking about cock and balls.  You're a waste of life. 
[00:01:00]  Fucking listeners, go fucking die.  Excuse me.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Wow.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Ah, yes.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi, everybody.  How's everyone today? 
[00:01:30]  Everybody out there.  Not too shabbly.  Fucking freezing out.  Oh, yeah.  Motherfucker.  Almost single digits, right?  Yes.  With the wind chill, it is about zero.  Zero out there.  But it's, yeah, it's like 16 degrees out there and just brutal fucking cold.  It's that, you can't really take a deep breath in it cold.  You got to do those shallow breaths and hold yourself as you walk. 
[00:02:00]  One of the newsmen.  I think I was listening to 1010 Winds on the way in.  With that deep voice.  Yes.  It's colder than a witch's torso.  Did he say that?  I swear to God he said that.  Colder than a witch's torso.  Here's John Montone.  And then, of course, John Montone has to find someone that, some schlub.  Oh, you heard the thing?  Fucking assholes.  They have to find a schlub, and I apologize for using that word, that has to work out 
[00:02:30]  in the cold.  Yeah.  You think it's cold for you.  Well, John Montone is talking to someone that's actually working in this cold weather.  So what's it like out here in the cold?  Oh, it's cold.  Ha.  Cold indeed.  He always says indeed.  And it's like, yeah, and then the guy is like, you know, I spoke with Emilio, who's  a doorman standing outside.  It's like, yeah, it's pretty cold out here.  Pretty cold, huh?  So are you wearing anything?  Well, you've got to wear layers and, you know, make sure, you know, you get inside every 
[00:03:00]  so often and keep warm.  Right, Emilio.  Keep warm.  Warm.  I'm John Montone.  So he switched it up because...  Such a formula.  When I was listening, John Montone was talking to someone in a hole.  In a hole.  Drilling or doing something.  You didn't hear the cop and that kept going into the...  No, I didn't hear the cop guy either.  See, you have a much longer ride.  You got to hear a few of them.  Yeah, I hear a couple of John Montones.  I only heard the one where the guy in the hole, and he said something about the machine  he was using was sort of keeping him a little warm. 
[00:03:30]  The machine's keeping him warm.  I like John Montone.  Oh, I know.  He definitely tries to make it a little different.  Yeah, yeah.  He's out there with the masses.  Right.  Even in the cold.  Even though it doesn't have to be.  No.  I would just every day go into the hallway of 1010 Wins and just talk to a secretary.  So it's cold out.  Oh, yeah, I'm freezing.  What are you doing?  Oh, I'm a crossing guard.  A crossing guard here in Orange.  And just like, who cares? 
[00:04:00]  He's not out.  Why go out?  He makes a lot of money.  No.  Nah, he can't.  No.  No way.  You're not like a million of millions?  No.  I don't think so.  He talks five minutes a day.  Yeah.  What else do you think he does?  He probably makes a...  Supplement.  I don't know.  He runs a thrift store or a...  I think he runs Numbers.  A shop.  He runs Numbers.  You think he has another gig?  Maybe he does.  I'm so ignorant of that stuff.  He's probably like a male prostitute or something.  I don't know. 
[00:04:30]  Here's sucking cock on the corner of...  Wait a minute.  What?  At the poor authority.  Giving hummers for change.  John Montone.  What are we doing?  We had him on the show and we all got alarmed.  He's a good guy.  Like a few years back, I don't know if he's still doing this, but he had that podcast or  some shit like that.  Yeah.  He's trying to do other things.  And yeah, he was pretty...  His language was a little salty on that, so I don't think he'd mind. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, no.  He's got a wild side.  He has a sense of humor.  Oh, absolutely.  He's a good guy.  All right.  That...  What the hell else was I thinking?  Oh, yeah.  God, driving in.  And I was listening to us for a little while.  Why would you do that?  Well, you know why?  I don't understand why anyone listens to us.  I know.  I was ready to just punch into the news, but I heard Bill.  I heard Bill Burr.  And it was a show from the old CBS studios where we couldn't curse or anything. 
[00:05:30]  Right, right, right.  We were talking, but fucking Bill, man.  He's just saying some shit about his...  Like, talking about how his dad would be yelling and shit.  And just...  Bill is a really funny guy.  Yeah, we all know that.  He's just a funny motherfucker.  I'm just going to be...  That whole attitude.  He's just like, I don't know about that.  And he could snap at any moment.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Which I love about him.  I think he's crazy.  I think Bill's...  I love...  You think he's got a little crazy...  It's really funny.  But I think he's a psychopath. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.  That's what I see.  Oh, because the eyes are open a little too wide?  He's like a wide-open doll face.  You want to believe that?  You want to believe that?  Oh, yeah, yeah, go ahead.  Just tiptoe through life like that.  Believe it or not.  Yeah, yeah.  I was talking to him backstage at your show.  Yeah, yeah.  Down there in Atlantic City.  For a while, actually.  I was in his dressing room.  And me and him are very similar and had very similar backgrounds.  Very.  And we both have a really nice side.  And we also both have a very evil, vicious side. 
[00:06:30]  And we see it in each other.  We joke with each other.  Like, we look in each other's eyes and we know what that look is.  Without even saying anything.  What the look is.  And in my family, it was my mom yelling and screaming.  And his, it was his dad.  His dad, right?  His dad.  I think I would have rather had my mom yelling and screaming than my dad.  Yeah, because your dad's also...  There's also the physical threat.  Holy shit, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Obviously, he had it worse.  I can't imagine that.  Always creepier with dad yelling. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, because we got to a point where my mom was like, all right, relax.  You're a woman.  Right.  Yeah.  But a dad, man.  Did you ever fight your dad?  No.  You ever fight your dad, Jimmy?  Came close once.  I picked up a stick.  A stick.  Did he just look at you like...  He was going to give me a beating.  I was young.  Stop it.  Yeah.  Put the stick down.  Never really fought, no.  Take your beating like a man.  We all had the day with my mom where she, like, raised the upper hand with, like, a wooden  spoon.  And he'd grab it and go, really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then you knew it was over. 
[00:07:30]  It was the turning point of that whole bullshit.  Moms can't really pull that off for very long.  But a dad could pretty much beat the shit out of you right up to the day you leave the  house for good.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Your dad could beat the shit out of you as long as you want to fight your dad, which is  when you're younger.  So it's not like...  It's not...  It's very rare you're going to get into your 30s and want to duke it out with your pops.  But, like, if you're 18, man, and I know everything, and I got the world by the balls, 
[00:08:00]  you just don't understand.  Yeah.  Like, at that age, he'll just put his hand on your head while you're doing that schoolyard  swing thing.  And maybe give you an open hand smack.  I do have to say, my dad never raised his voice, and never got physical with us.  No spanking, even?  Not a spanking?  No, not really.  No, not really.  He allowed...  His problem was he allowed my mom to have the run of the place. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, that could get a little iffy.  Maybe he should have stepped in instead of watching the Knicks, you know, on TV.  Would he watch the Knicks while she was yelling?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He loved Walt Frazier, Bill Bradley, Dave DeBusher, Jerry Lucas.  Just turn the volume up louder when...  Dick Barnett.  ...when things were going down.  Oh, yeah.  And she yelled at him, too?  No, she respected him, I guess.  Let's go inside and watch the football. 
[00:09:00]  My dad would try to use logic, and she couldn't decipher that.  She couldn't ingest that at all.  That's why I left at 18.  I was done.  Meh.  I was done.  I couldn't do what you did.  Yeah.  You left at an earlier age, more or less.  Eh, I really left at, like, 22.  Oh, fuck.  No, man.  The day I knew I was leaving for college, I knew my whole life was changing. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, but I wasn't going...  I sure wasn't going to college, so my life was going to be, you know, at some job site  somewhere in the cold, so I was like, fuck this.  I say college, but I went to a little town where I could drink seven days a week.  Yeah, yeah.  That's nice.  It's nice to say to people I went to college, but Geneseo back then was really not the place  to go to get smart.  No?  Nah.  Eh.  I mean, they get pissed at me, and that's why they never invite me back, because it was  crap back then.  You know what it was, though? 
[00:10:00]  It was a place to go.  But now, it's almost impossible to get into Geneseo, so when I tell people, yeah, I went  to Geneseo, they're like, whoa, look at you, you're some kind of scholar, are you?  I'm like, no.  When I went...  Have you heard the show?  Right.  When I went, there was a bar on every corner.  It was a drink special.  It was a crazy party drinking school.  Yeah.  And over the years, they obviously wanted to change their image.  But it was a place for you to leave home to go to.  Oh.  Like, I didn't have any place. 
[00:10:30]  For me, it was like, all right, now get a job, and then get a place to live that you  could pay rent with your job.  Right.  And then do that.  So, I couldn't leave home right away and go to college at 18.  That would have been nice to just even have a fucking dorm room to be in or something.  See, we were different in that regard because I fell into caddy-in when I was, I think, 12  or 13, which was way more money than a paper route or a penny saver route.  Oh, yeah.  People had penny saver routes on Long Island as well. 
[00:11:00]  Penny saver.  So, I was making really good money that went to the household.  That was my issue.  So, when I turned 18, I'm like, fuck this.  Yeah.  I'd rather be poor somewhere.  So, when I was picking colleges, I knew I could only afford a SUNY school because, well,  I have a college fund for your seven kids.  We had to pay for it ourselves, so I could only afford that.  So, when I was picking schools, I actually looked at the map, I remember to this day, 
[00:11:30]  and I was like, what is the furthest school away from my house?  Wow.  Because there's a lot of SUNY schools.  That was the criteria?  Yeah, there's a lot of SUNY schools close to Long Island, but then you started looking  at the ones that were really far away, and there were three.  There was Fredonia, Geneseo, and I forgot the other one, Oswego or something like that,  which is the one way up near the Canadian border, where it gets, right now it's probably minus  20 degrees.  Yeah, exactly.  And then I saw which one had the better communications program and said, all right, Geneseo, it is. 
[00:12:00]  And I made sure I was as far away as possible, and then never really looked back.  Yeah.  So, I don't know why we're talking about that, but.  Oh, because of Bill Burr.  Right.  And Bill's going to be part of your show that you're announcing.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  Will the tickets go on sale today, Jimmy?  No, no, tomorrow.  No, Friday morning.  Friday morning.  Thank you.  For April 30th, myself, Burr, Attell, Brewer, Foxwoods, one show only. 
[00:12:30]  Hopefully we'll sell out.  One show only.  And it's a definite one show only?  Oh, yeah.  It looks like it is, because I don't know.  Room availability is a problem for us sometimes.  People are selfish with your one show.  Other things booked, so.  Oh.  But it's funny.  Bill's such a normal guy.  Like, he's a weird dude.  Like, professionally, he's great.  And he's a great comic.  He really is a funny guy.  Yeah.  But I just, I know it's going to end badly.  And I don't know how, but it's going to end.  But a lot of people don't know that about Bill, because Bob Kelly lived with him.  And then we were all, you know, kind of coming up here. 
[00:13:00]  And, you know, he'll tell you, like, you know, dude, he's fucking, he's nuts.  And that's coming from Bobby.  Yeah.  But everybody knows Bob is kind of a kook in a juvie hall, fucking wacko.  Yeah.  I almost got into it with Bob one time years ago.  Dumb arguing.  Really?  Yeah.  Bob's, like, bad.  Bill's the same way.  You argue with these guys, and he gets to a point where that shitty Boston part of them  comes out.  Yeah.  And, you know, and then it's like, all right, look, you know, what the fuck?  And he just starts yelling at you.  And it's like, and that's Bob, I mean.  The tough guy. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, but he doesn't even mean to be that way.  He's just ass.  You know what, though?  Out of the inner circle of guys that do our show, you know, obviously, Jimmy being the  leader, and you got the Patrice, and the Bill Burr, and the Rich Voss, and the Bob Kelly.  Bob Kelly, believe it or not, is the one that scares me the most.  Really?  And he comes across very lovable on this show, and we all know, right?  But he's a guy that would fuck you up if you pushed him too hard.  He'd drill his fist into someone's face.  Yeah.  No problem.  And then, but that would be the start of it, and he wouldn't stop. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Like, I don't think he would have that switch.  If you turn that switch on at him, I'm more scared of him than any other guy that comes  in.  With Bill Burr, probably a close second.  But Bobby, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, something's not right in those eyes sometimes.  Well, because he really does have black eyes, like the way they describe George.  Robert Short described George like a doll's eyes.  Lifeless eyes.  Lifeless eyes.  Like a doll's eyes.  Doesn't even seem to be living till he eats something. 
[00:14:30]  But Bob's thing is, Bob's very compassionate, so even if he got mad and was fighting, I think  if you, even though he'd be angry, Bob could be backed off because he's a compassionate  guy.  Yeah.  Like, he's not an animal.  He's a really compassionate dude.  So I could see him backing off if he saw that he was hurting somebody.  Bill hides behind that giant smile of his.  Oh, happiness.  He's always like, hey, how you doing?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Smiling.  Smiling.  Right up until he snaps, he'll be smiling. 
[00:15:00]  And if you said that to him, he'd probably put his arm on, dude, you think this is happy?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This looks happy to you?  So true.  Hey, it really doesn't need to be promoted, but I just want to mention it.  The fucking Fedor video is doing really well.  Thank you to everybody who's retweeting it and sending it around because the numbers are  ridiculous.  Norton getting choked out by Fedor yesterday.  I don't watch myself in videos a lot.  I get embarrassed because I hate looking at myself, but I literally watched that one 30  times.  Yeah.  It was just, it just starts on him squeezing my arm, sitting next to me, and then it goes 
[00:15:30]  into the chokes.  It was fucking great.  Yeah, the chokes are great.  You made another great sound.  But I noticed, like, I kept watching him picking up different things, like how much Kenny was  enjoying it.  Oh, yeah.  And then how much his guys gathered in the windows.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then how he was smiling.  He really enjoyed that.  You see that smile he gives?  Like, yeah, yeah.  I don't understand his language, but I understand fucking pain.  And I try to tell you, like, it wasn't smart to have Fedor put those moves on you because 
[00:16:00]  of the translation thing.  Like, you even said it, I think, in the video.  I'm not sure if it made the final cut, that he held on a little longer than everybody  else.  Oh, yeah.  And he did it.  The rest of the guy, as soon as you tap, they let go.  Like, okay, I don't want any problems here.  He fucking gave me an extra two or three.  Well, he kept, he would relax.  Like, I would tap and he would wait a second and then he would release.  But then he would keep me there and squeeze again.  And he'd do it again.  Oh, dude, he did it like three times.  I was, you know, I was kind of happy he did that.  You were at his command.  I still have a sore throat.  I've been taking ibuprofen since yesterday. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it's good.  I'll try again.  And then Bobby's cameo at the end, like, taking on Frank Shamrock going, all right, you  cocksucker.  Yeah.  With that stupid Boston accent.  Trying to act and make a scene out of it.  They can believe he's, like, some asshole in a bar.  And then people noticed that you were tapping out for Bobby.  What's that about?  I tapped for Bobby.  Did you see that, Ant?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, you did?  Yep.  I tapped.  Jimmy's like, okay, enough, enough, enough.  Why?  Because I saw Bob.  And I saw his big, dumb arms go up in the air.  And he literally looked like just a large infant. 
[00:17:00]  And I'm like, he can't tap because his arms.  His arms were up.  His arms were up in the air.  And he couldn't have, he would have tapped.  He wouldn't have hit anything.  See?  So Frank might have thought he was tougher than he was.  That showed me what a sweet boy you are.  Because I would have let Bobby suffer.  I should have.  I think Anthony would have let him suffer as well.  And you were like, no, no, I've got to take care of my friend.  Tap, tap, tap.  That's the one where he's like, take a swing at me.  Yeah.  You know?  And he goes, takes the swing.  And Frank just tied him up.  But he did it in a cartoon fashion, Bobby. 
[00:17:30]  That's why I love it.  All right, you quark sucker.  Yeah, Ken's better than you.  He builds a whole scene.  All right, it's raining.  My umbrella's in your house.  All right.  I'm showing you a move.  You don't have to fucking film with him.  It's not the expendables.  I'm working on a montage of all the times you got choked out.  And I'm laughing my balls off.  It's not ready.  It's going to take a while.  I want to get more guys to do that.  I'm glad we got Fedor.  More guys, you already got?  I only got four.  Five, because you had Frank, too, yesterday.  Oh, right, right, right.  I didn't really put that in the video, because it was all about Fedor. 
[00:18:00]  Fedor was frightening, man.  Yeah.  It was just frightening.  He was very quiet.  Well, he has to be quiet.  He doesn't speak the language.  But I mean, literally.  I wonder if he's a quiet guy in general.  He has to be quiet if he doesn't know the language.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, but even when he was talking in Russian to the translator, he's so soft-spoken.  And I couldn't tell.  Was he thinking out every answer very carefully?  Or did he just, you know, I don't know what I'm saying. 
[00:18:30]  It's so odd.  It was literally, yeah, of course.  Yeah, yeah.  That's that weird, he's one of the, they always say the quiet guys you've got to watch out for.  Oh, God.  Like, that's the perfect example of a guy who's just really quiet and really, you know, he doesn't try to fucking intimidate people.  And he doesn't make a lot of eye contact, like, to be a...  No, no.  But it was weird, I would talk to her, and then while she was answering me, he would just, he was sitting there looking at me, and he's looking right in my eyes. 
[00:19:00]  And it's just conversational, but it is like, you don't ever want to be misinterpreted looking back, like you're trying to...  It's like looking into the eyes of, like, a lion or something.  You're just like, oh, boy, there's something there that could just rip you to pieces.  I think he has a good sense of humor, though.  Yeah.  He was laughing a little bit.  Yeah, he enjoyed it, yeah.  And he definitely enjoyed himself.  Yeah.  The translator didn't have any sense of humor whatsoever.  Nah, I guess that's their job.  She was...  But there was...  I know that she enjoyed this, because I said goodbye to her.  Oh, yeah.  She was having fun. 
[00:19:30]  She doesn't have to do interviews like this.  It's usually all pure MMA shows where they're asking him nothing but technical questions.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, you know, and their idea of a crazy question, it might be one about food or something.  Yeah, true.  This is a different vibe.  Right, right, right.  She's trying to translate what they're saying back there, what we're saying, the humor.  That's a pretty tough job.  You see his, like, his profile?  His crew is not fun.  He looks...  No.  He has profile.  His profile's like every...  He looks so Russian. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  And so just, like, menacing.  It's like, oh, God, I would hate to have that guy have a problem with me.  We, you know, we remember a time where you didn't really see many Russians.  No.  You know what I mean?  They were the bad guys.  You never saw Russians.  No.  And in the last, how many years now?  It's been a while, I guess, right?  10, 15 years.  Ever since the big fall.  Now you see Russians.  But think about it.  When we were growing up, you never really saw Russians.  So when you saw them on TV during the Olympics, a Rocky movie, whatever it was, they were like, 
[00:20:30]  holy fuck, the Russians.  And from what you heard about it, it was like, oh, yeah, these Russians, oh, boy, they're crazy.  And so you had this impression, you know, they were all militaristic and, you know, yay communism.  Very stoic.  Yeah, yeah.  And then you find out, you know, some of them were with a load of laughs.  Yeah.  Others are fucking dangerous as all hell.  They were very mysterious, right?  Yeah.  When we were growing up.  A lot of mystique behind them.  I was looking at his Twitter.  Oh, shki.  He only has a few.  They're all in Russian. 
[00:21:00]  He has very few tweets.  But there's a picture of him.  I got to follow him.  They're in Russian?  You understand none of it.  Yeah.  That's awesome.  Throwing in a translator.  That's way better than half the people I follow.  How'd it work?  I did translate it.  And it was like, well, it was like mostly religion.  He's like, he's an Orthodox Christian.  Oh.  So he's, that's why, you know, it's like he doesn't do any of the, he's just, whatever.  So there was a couple of guys with him, I think that were like his religious guys.  The guy was with the beards.  I think they were, because they were in one of his pictures. 
[00:21:30]  Russian Orthodox?  I guess.  Because he was a picture, one of his pictures, he's got a, he's in some place, he's holding something.  And like, it looks like he's in a church.  And he's like, I got to do this with the Blessed Mother.  Like, he's just, he's a religious guy.  Wow.  Yeah.  I see that.  He's a very religious guy.  Huh.  Well, they're doing that Showtime thing, right?  Yeah.  I don't know what it is.  They're fighting Saturday at 10.  I talked to the Showtime guys that we are absolutely using a lot of the footage we had.  Oh, good, good, good.  We filmed yesterday.  But I'm sure SiriusXM will fuck it up in some way.  Yeah, they should let SiriusXM. 
[00:22:00]  They still won't take responsibility for the big time Apprentice fuck up.  Oh, God.  Yeah, that's right.  We were supposed to be on the Apprentice.  Oh, right.  And the Apprentice people were like, look, your company didn't get the paperwork back to us in time.  So we weren't allowed to use the footage.  And we wanted to use the footage because we got some great stuff that day.  Then you talk to the guys down the hall.  Well, that's not true.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I believe the Apprentice people.  They work.  So don't fuck up the Showtime thing is the only reason I'm bringing this up.  I agree. 
[00:22:30]  And they work very slowly here.  Just sign the fucking paper.  Not many people watched that show anyway.  The Apprentice.  I know.  You know, why get on there?  Why would you dilly-dally when you got the Apprentice wanting to use footage where it has  Opie and Anthony Sirius XM logos all over the place?  How do you fuck that one up?  Because they're not.  The lawyers, and I think he's a blamed lawyer, but they're corporate guys.  They're not, quote, unquote.  Even though this is an entertainment company, I think they act like lawyers for fucking, you 
[00:23:00]  know, I cannot think of one corporation.  You ever need a corporation and you can't think of one?  Just go Enron.  I'm trying.  There you go.  Enron.  They act like.  That's the go-to corporation, Enron.  They act like Enron lawyers as opposed to guys who are in the entertainment business  trying to kind of help the entertainment side and get the legal stuff done.  They don't act like that.  There's no distinction between the product of personality-driven radio and the product  of, you know, just whatever it is, tuna fish cans going out on a conveyor belt. 
[00:23:30]  Like, they've got to distinguish the fact that this is different.  And the way shows are treated is different than the way a box of fucking widgets going  out of a factory into a loading truck.  Right.  It's different.  It's just a whole different thing and it's just got to be treated differently.  Yeah.  All they wanted was, it probably would have been a minute of time on The Apprentice, if  that, of us telling dick jokes, just sign the paper.  What, what's, how could it be complicated? 
[00:24:00]  I agree.  And they got to get that done because these networks are not, Showtime, they're not going  to wait for you.  Yeah.  The Apprentice didn't need us.  They were going to have a good show whether they used the Opie and Anthony footage or  not.  Because they have so much extra.  They didn't need us, but they wanted to use it because they thought it was good stuff.  Well, this is where the lawyer should, or whoever it was.  I know who it was.  Should be.  And he gave me his excuse and to this day, I don't buy it.  Sorry.  This is where they should be very accountable.  This company spends a lot of money trying to get press because they value free press. 
[00:24:30]  You know, like they sign so-and-so, they sign so-and-so, you get in the paper, you become  part of a pop call, whatever.  I get that.  But this is free national television advertising.  You'd think.  You cannot fuck that up.  You can't.  You know what I mean?  Whether it's Showtime or The Apprentice at NBC, you can't mess up free advertising.  Well, they did.  And the only reason we're bringing it up today is because Showtime was in here.  They filmed a shitload of stuff, and they really liked what they got, so don't fuck it up  again.  Yeah, we'd like to see it again.  You have a chance to not fuck it up again, is all I'm saying. 
[00:25:00]  Give it a shot.  Give it a shot.  You cannot spend money to get advertising and then have The Apprentice want to put you  on for nothing and show you.  And then we blow it.  They blur logos.  People want advertising so bad, they blur logos out on TV so that you don't wear shirts  with certain things on them or GoDaddy or whatever these stupid sites are.  So you can't blow it when it comes up.  What did you think of the Joan Rivers spot on the Super Bowl?  I didn't see it. 
[00:25:30]  You said GoDaddy, so.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't see that one.  No.  You didn't see the...  Joan Rivers?  No.  I saw a picture of her in that one.  Yeah, I saw a still pic from it.  That's her.  What'd she do, anyway?  She's the new GoDaddy girl.  Oh, yeah.  But obviously, you know, they put her head on a really smoking body.  Oh, that's what they did.  Okay.  And then they vaselined the shit out of the lens and...  For her head.  For her head and everything.  How did it look?  Like, how was the spot?  Was it funny or was it a serious spot?  I don't know what I think of Joan Rivers. 
[00:26:00]  I gotta be honest with you.  Yeah, I guess it was funny.  I think she's out of her mind right now.  She's a little nuts, yeah.  You think?  Like now, yeah, she...  I loved her piece of work, or whatever it was called.  That documentary was really good.  But I felt...  I don't know if you guys have seen it yet, but I know Jimmy has.  Have you seen Piece of Work?  Joan Rivers documentary?  I saw a Joan Rivers documentary, and it was probably that one.  It was very recent.  It was probably last year.  Yeah, it does.  Does it just show her driving around everywhere? 
[00:26:30]  Thank you.  Everywhere, yeah.  And fucking not stopping?  Thank you, and that's the point I'm gonna make.  I felt really sorry for her.  Yeah, yeah.  Because she's been in entertainment since we were fucking fetuses.  Yeah.  No joke.  She's been at this 50 years, I think.  And she's there.  And Sullivan.  She did Sullivan.  Yeah.  And she doesn't...  She's not enjoying her success whatsoever.  She's still, like, pushing and pushing.  Clawing.  And clawing is a better word.  In a way, like, something is damaged inside that woman.  That's what it seemed like. 
[00:27:00]  She couldn't just sit still for a second.  She's on the phone with her people, constantly having to book something, taking red-eye flights  from one gig to a TV appearance to do her, selling her wares on the home shopping thing.  Like, they showed her in so many cars, just almost falling asleep or dying or whatever the fuck she was doing.  And going to really shitty gigs.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, really shit gigs.  I understand Jimmy going to shitty gigs.  Yeah, you're right, though. 
[00:27:30]  No, I'm joking.  I'm joking.  That was just a dumb little joke.  But Joan Rivers, 50 years in, you would think she'd be like, I ain't doing the shitty gigs anymore.  You know?  Yeah.  I'll go on Leno every once in a while.  I'll go here.  But I'm not going to some weird casino in the middle of Canada, wherever that one was.  She would go to, like, the Midwest and just play some shitty fucking, not even at all.  It was like a club.  Right.  So you did see it.  Horrible, yeah.  And she's coming home to Manhattan, and she's trying to get two hours sleep, because then she's got another thing to do the following day. 
[00:28:00]  And I felt sorry for her, and I felt like, yeah, there's something that she's not dealing with in that head of hers.  I mean, there's drive and ambition, but when you reach that age, you've got to maybe start enjoying the fruits of your labor.  Yeah, you can still have ambition, but you've got to also enjoy it and relax a little bit.  I think it makes her feel alive.  Like, without that, Jesus Christ.  We're looking at Egypt.  I think it's Egypt or no? 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  Oh, God, they're just running people over.  Hey, don't let them drag you out.  Oops.  Oh, they got you.  Oh, boy.  Look at them.  Pickup trucks.  You never want to see a guy looking at you with something over his head.  No.  No.  Wow.  They fucked him up.  The protesters, I guess, were being run over by this guy in a pickup truck with a bunch of people in the back of the pickup truck.  And then the crowd turned on him and kind of caught him, pulled him out of the driver's side window.  How would you leave your door unlocked? 
[00:29:00]  I know, right, if you're going to do that.  And Cairo has now, there it is, turning into Tent City.  You see that?  Yeah, there's supposed to be one of the biggest yet, one of the biggest demonstrations yet, I think, today or tomorrow.  Well, the Google guy.  Google.  The Google guy that started this whole thing was talking to the crowd.  Yeah.  He was released after questioning.  Oh, wow.  He was all tense and kind of a mess.  What a wreck.  Well, there's no jobs for these guys to go to.  Yeah.  You know what they make?  Terrible.  I was like, wait, that's 40%.  Was it 40% of the country makes less than $2,000 a year? 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  A year?  A year.  Righteous bucks.  And you've got a leader who's worth $70 billion.  You've got a leader that's worth more than Bill Gates and more than Warren Buffett.  He has $70 billion in the bank.  I love Warren Buffett songs.  Oh, great.  It's Jimmy Buffett.  Oh, that guy.  That finance guy.  Guy's got $70 billion.  And a lot of people talk that he made that off his own people.  But you know what?  And making wheeling and dealing.  This guy ain't fucking leaving. 
[00:30:00]  I know.  This motherfucker is not leaving.  He doesn't care.  He's probably looking going, you know what?  I can make it through this.  This is a little fucking speed bump.  And not only is he not leaving, I don't think he leaves in September.  No.  I don't think so either.  I think that was to try to calm everyone down.  And then September comes around.  He's like, fuck you.  I can't leave.  He said, I can't leave.  You people don't understand the turmoil that would happen if I left.  So he's telling them it's in all their best interest to leave him alone and leave him 
[00:30:30]  in office and, you know, come back to your life.  I don't necessarily disagree with him anymore because you don't really see anyone stepping  up.  You need someone to step up when you're having a revolution.  Yeah.  Who's the guy?  Yeah.  You need a Fidel.  You got the Muslim Brotherhood.  They're fucking, you know, circling, circling the wagons.  We don't want them, though.  Of course not.  I almost hope he doesn't leave.  It's like he's not as bad as Saddam was.  But after seeing the way the Iraqi people, how they didn't want the soldiers there, I  really, it's like, I don't care what happens.  And I just kind of hope he stays.  Now, that sounds terrible, but fuck him. 
[00:31:00]  I'm sick and tired of worrying about other countries.  Who's stepping up?  No one.  Yeah, at this point.  Are they going to have a free election?  60 hours a month.  The free elections have never worked in Egypt.  Sure, that'll be great.  They've been having free elections for the last whatever years.  Hey, Mubarak wins again.  Right, right.  You don't think that.  Last time he got 90% of the votes.  Shenanigans.  From a populist that fucking hates him.  Yeah.  How does that happen?  How does that happen?  Remember that Saddam used to have elections, too?  Yeah.  And he'd get, like, 100% of the vote and come out and wave to everybody, like, thank you, 
[00:31:30]  my people.  The fucking asshole couldn't accept, like, okay, I'll allow.  I'll do, like, 90%.  I'll do 97%.  And then they're like, no, because the 10%, you would have killed them anyway, so we don't  buy it.  It has to be 100%.  It has to be.  Fucking asshole.  Ah, well.  I miss Saddam.  It was fun to have around.  Yeah, me too.  They really hated him, though.  No, they really hated him.  Oh, yeah, but they were afraid as fuck of that guy.  I know.  That's why they annoy me now, piping up. 
[00:32:00]  Where were you 10 years ago?  Yeah, he was sitting there in fear, cowering to your dictator.  At least the Kurds tried.  Yeah.  That revolution was a gas.  See?  I was using 60s terms, but he literally killed a lot of people with gas.  Yeah, he did.  Speaking of the Egyptians, I made a bread video with Bobo in it.  It was a massive fail.  Epic.  Wow, what happened?  Epic fail. 
[00:32:30]  We went to find the pigeons, and hey, man, I got to pat myself on the back.  I know where the pigeons are.  You apparently didn't know where the pigeons are.  I told you guys I knew where the pigeons were.  A lot of pigeons.  But they would not eat off Bobo's bread hat.  Really?  I noticed there were some handsome cabs there where they used the horse-drawn carriages.  Right.  And that's where the birds congregate because they like the feed for the horses.  Yeah.  But I'm not giving up.  We're going to go back out there with bird seed. 
[00:33:00]  One of the best scenes was him all lonely, sitting on the park bench with the dumb piece  of bread strapped to his head as he's taking another piece and feeding the birds.  That was like from an old 50s movie of a guy that just lost his job, and before he goes  home to tell his wife, he goes to the park to feed the birds.  You know what, dude?  I should have consulted you on this one.  Fuck.  That's exactly what dummy looked like.  I should have made it in black and white and fucking aged the fucking film. 
[00:33:30]  Aged it a little bit.  And then have that weird fucking writing.  Yeah.  They don't have that fun anymore.  The silent film writing.  Silent film.  Fuck.  I should have consulted you.  Just have him on the park bench.  You should have seen this is why you need an iPhone.  Oh, yeah.  Because there's an app for that.  Yeah.  My iMove's got it.  I could do it with the iMove.  You also got to powder his face and tell him to keep his eyes open real wide so it looks  very silent movie-ish.  I might make a silent movie with Bobo now.  That would be really funny just to make a silent movie with him. 
[00:34:00]  I would have doled.  That's how his appearances should be, too.  Yeah.  That's silent radio.  You can check out The Fail.  It's on my YouTube channel.  I hope you're radio.  And to the guys that go, enough with Bobo.  Everyone hates Bobo.  Why are you clicking on a video that says Bobo's bread hat feeds New York City pigeons?  The people that really hate Bobo and can't stand him are not clicking on a video that  says Bobo in it, you dopes.  No.  Guy writes this whole thing on the video.  I'm sick of him. 
[00:34:30]  I can't stand him enough already.  This whole long thing.  And I'm like, idiot.  All you have to do is not click on the video.  Yeah.  I know people don't like Bobo.  They're the ones not checking out the videos.  You can't click on a video and then talk about how much you hate the fucking guy.  That's psychotic.  Yeah.  Some people just don't get it.  I know people don't like him.  They're the ones that just, you know what?  Oh, they saw a Bobo video.  They're like, eh, I'm not clicking on that.  I can't stand the fucking guy.  I see links on Twitter and stuff. 
[00:35:00]  And I'll look at the link and look at the back end of the link and see like it has some  keywords that maybe something I don't want to say.  Right.  I pass right over it.  Right.  I'm not going to look.  Why?  Right.  If you see Bobo in it and you don't like Bobo, don't click it.  Yeah.  You look stupid.  You look really stupid.  It's so easy to do.  Because that means you clicked on something.  That means you're still fascinated with Bobo enough that you had to check out the video.  Dummies.  Jesus Christ.  All right.  Hey, who do we got?  Who's Les Stroud? 
[00:35:30]  Survivor Man.  Oh, okay.  He's Survivor Man.  Which one's Survivor Man?  It scared the shit out of me.  I'm like, we're talking to this guy.  I don't even know who it is.  Yeah.  I know who it is.  And he came in.  He's the guy that's not Man vs. Wild.  He's more like down and dirty.  He's not Bear Grylls.  Oh, he has to stay in the Four Seasons when he's supposed to be in the woods.  By the way, Derek has a really big boner for Les Stroud.  Does he?  Oh, does he?  Big time.  I think I remember that from last time.  Derek's okay.  He just goes with a dumb camcorder by himself, right? 
[00:36:00]  Apparently.  And it looks like an old school camcorder.  I don't even think he's upgraded his camera even.  People, I think Blair likes camera.  They like him more because he is more real than him.  Yeah, I remember him.  We had a great time with him a couple years back.  He came in.  I just didn't know him by name.  I'm sorry.  All right.  So Les Stroud from Survivor Man is coming in.  Cool.  Weren't we supposed to get those guys to, we were going to interview the kidnap guys?  Because I watched the shows on, it was pretty good actually.  You liked it?  Yeah.  Do you not like it?  I didn't see it yet.  They grabbed people in Mexico and they helped get kidnapped victims out of Mexico. 
[00:36:30]  It's actually a pretty intense job.  I've seen the trailers for it.  It looked pretty good.  I watched Top Shot last night.  Oh, no spoilers, please.  I fell asleep.  DVR.  Oh, okay.  I want no spoilers.  What's the spoilers?  Some guy with guns shot a hole through a target.  Guns.  Well, there's two teams, you know, the red team and the blue team.  Couldn't they have picked other colors?  I don't know.  You know, the blue team probably stinks if it's true to life with the way the U.S. is.  The blue team feels guilty shooting the targets. 
[00:37:00]  It has to be recycled paper.  It was a good start, you know.  It kind of gave you a little example of some of the people's skills and lack thereof.  But I don't like the idea that if there's the first challenge that the team has to do  and if one guy is kind of bad at it that day.  See, they're still doing that?  It's like, why try to get rid of him immediately?  You could still assess other people and go like, yeah, you know, maybe that one time he 
[00:37:30]  fucked up.  But if he's an expert fucking sniper or something, he's probably pretty good.  You know, I wouldn't vote him off immediately.  Especially because it's top shot.  And like the guy that gets eliminated on like the hatchet throwing event, like it sucks.  Like, come on.  Like, what if he's the man that's shooting long range targets with a rifle?  Like, why would you get rid of him?  Why would they have guys throwing hatchets if it's all about top shot?  Because it's like just hitting a target with something. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, but that's a totally different skill.  I know.  That's why that doesn't make sense.  I agree.  That's the one thing I didn't like about the first season last year because they just  had way too much stuff that just wasn't guns.  Like, they had archery and knife throwing.  And it's cool.  Don't get me wrong.  But the show is called Top Shot.  But that should be maybe a, I like these reality shows, that should be maybe like a challenge  where they get something for that.  Like a bonus or something.  But it doesn't knock out of the competition.  It shouldn't be an elimination thing.  So you can at least see these guys throwing hatchets because that would be cool.  But to be eliminated, that's kind of dumb. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, that is.  100%.  Yeah, you should be, if you're voted off or whatever the hell it is.  Whatever it is.  It should be because of your firearm skills.  The show's called Top Shot.  Yeah.  In the end, it's really about what you can do with a gun, right?  There's a thousand guns.  I'm sure they could find a different gun and come up with some crazy challenge before we  get to crossbows and stuff.  They were shooting pool balls at various distances.  That's cool.  So it's kind of...  Those things shatter?  Oh, my God.  Their camera work is great, too, because they use high-speed cameras where you... 
[00:39:00]  The thought that you can have a camera nowadays that is so good and so high-speed that in  just HD, you can see the bullet leave the gun, and it's like...  Just boom!  It just blows up the pool balls.  What happens to a cue ball?  It just turns to dust.  It does, right?  On a direct hit.  It just explodes?  Yeah.  Some of them were hitting the top and shit, which is still a hit.  And other guys that you think would have been really good were fucking up. 
[00:39:30]  What was the furthest distance they were hitting balls at?  I think it was 50 feet, not yards, 50 feet with a 1911 Colt.  Is that good?  God, I don't know.  The year you beat it, or is that the style?  It's actually the year it came out.  A 1911 gun they're using?  And the style, but it's still...  The 1911 is one of the most popular .45s out there.  It's still being made by a lot of companies.  Colt, I think, stopped making it in like 85, but it was used in World War I, World War II, 
[00:40:00]  Korea, Vietnam, up until 1985.  It's automatic?  Yeah.  That's the gun?  That's the gun.  That's from 1911?  That was design.  The design came from 1911.  They've incorporated safeties in it, but the basic 1911 design is a classic military sidearm.  Do you have one of those yet?  Yeah, I got about three.  He's the one under his hat right now.  He doesn't even know.  Every soldier or officer in World War II, that was their sidearm. 
[00:40:30]  That was a 1911.  That's the sidearm of your superior officer in World War II.  What's an original one worth?  Probably in good condition.  Probably a lot.  Have you looked into trying to get an original?  No, I haven't really looked into any of the antique pistols yet.  I got some rifles.  I got British Enfield from World War II.  One antique pistol, what do you get?  You have to get one of those ones they used when dueling.  Like a dueling set with the case, and you've got to load up the black powder. 
[00:41:00]  But how cool would that be?  That's a conversation piece.  It would be pretty cool, yeah.  But that would be downstairs.  That would be displayed in the office or something.  How much is a gun like that?  Is that one of those?  Is that a dueling gun?  Yeah, that's nice.  Dueling pistol?  Italian dueling pistol.  Holy fuck, that looks cool.  What's a really rare gun?  And how much is it worth?  I have no idea about gun pricing.  Yeah, it varies so much.  I mean, you've got some from the 1700s that still fire.  They still fucking work. 
[00:41:30]  Would people fire them or no?  Flint locks.  Oh, yeah.  They get out there and load them up with black powder and boom.  How much are they worth?  Again, depends on condition and stuff.  But it could be thousands of dollars.  It could be hundreds.  Yeah, they have a lot of cool gun stuff comes in on Pawn Stars, believe it or not.  Pawn Stars, yeah, yeah.  They have a lot of really old stuff from the 1500s, 1600s, 1700s.  Oh, wow.  That will come in sometimes.  They'll get guns off of pirate ships and shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's pretty cool.  That blunderbuss?  What was it?  The blunderbuss? 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  It was one of those guns that Yosemite Sam would use in a cartoon.  You didn't even put bullets in it.  You just put shrapnel.  You just jam garbage down the front of it and it would just shoot it the fuck out of you.  Yeah, it wasn't even meant for a bullet.  But unless it was a little cannonball, because the thing was usually like a handheld cannon.  And it was one of those where the end kind of belled out like a trumpet.  Wow.  And they would load it up with black powder.  And then just anything that's laying around, pieces of chain, fucking that.  And then they would shoot it at the sails.  Yeah.  And fucking, not the sails department. 
[00:42:30]  They would shoot it at the sails of the ship.  Yeah, look at that little thing.  And they would also get up in the masts of the ship.  And when the ships would come close to each other, they would just lay fire down onto the decks and wipe out the sailors.  But wouldn't your, like, if you tip it down, would all the stuff just fall out of it?  No, I guess they'd jam it in there.  And then you could put a piece of wadding in front of it to hold it in, to hold the crap in there.  I know that gun from the Johnny Depp movies.  Yeah, the blunderbuss. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  I know.  That's where I know that one.  Do they use any of these weird guns on Top Shot?  Yeah, sometimes they get, yeah, they get the flintlocks from, like, the Revolutionary War and Civil War days.  Muskets.  Which are hard to shoot because it's got the flint and then it's got the pan with the powder in it.  So when you pull the trigger, the first thing is the pan flashes.  And then you've got to sit there still holding it steady because another split second goes by and then the bullet comes out of the front.  The ball comes out of the front of the gun. 
[00:43:30]  So you can't be distracted by this giant flash of gunpowder in front of your face.  You've still got to hold the gun steady.  Would they work like a shotgun, kind of?  No, those are like a ball, just a lead ball that would come out, about .50 caliber.  No, I mean the junk.  Oh, the junk one?  Yeah.  Yeah, that would work like a shotgun.  But how far can a shotgun shoot?  I always get the impression it can't shoot far.  Effectively, yeah, it's not a long range gun unless there's slugs in it, which is just, you know, one could be just one piece of lead come out. 
[00:44:00]  Sometimes there's three in there and then sometimes there's birdshot.  Birdshot isn't a long distance round.  It's, you know, it spreads out.  It could do some damage.  That's what Cheney's friend caught in the face.  Yeah, I got shot in the face.  Oh, is that what he had?  Oh, okay.  Wow, you've got the gun people calling.  Colt still makes the 1911.  They do?  And is wrong.  Oh, no, no.  I was saying in 1985 they stopped using it as a sidearm.  Oh, I think you might stop making it through. 
[00:44:30]  As a standard issue.  Okay.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah, they're lit.  Yeah, I'm sorry about that.  People don't know their shit.  They're like, whoa, slow down there, buddy.  No, no, they stopped using it as a...  I might have to check out Top Shot now.  You just made that show interesting.  It's kind of cool to watch, man.  These guys, they got some skills, too.  Sure beats the Biggest Loser.  Jesus, same show every six months.  Enough.  I used to like this Biggest Loser.  Yeah.  Probably not the most popular thing to say on this show, but as far as reality shows go,  I kind of like that one. 
[00:45:00]  For fat shows, I watch heavy now.  There's no prize.  There's no nothing.  But the people are utterly disgusting.  And they're always crying when they exercise.  I can't do this.  Shut up, you pig.  Do a fucking push-up.  Have some self-control.  Something.  Then they had a challenge yesterday on The Biggest Loser.  And the heaviest guy in the house is like 500 pounds.  Obviously needs to fucking get his shit together.  Yeah.  And they had a Valentine's Day candy challenge. 
[00:45:30]  And whoever ate the most candy in three minutes got to kind of change the game just to keep it very basic for everyone that doesn't give a shit about this show.  Yeah.  So you think the guy that's, I think he's like 500 pounds, would go, you know what, I'm not eating candy because I'm here to really figure out how to eat properly and exercise.  This motherfucker was one of the only ones that ate.  There's only a handful that ate out of like 20 contestants.  Yeah.  Ate 35 pieces of candy in three minutes.  What a slob. 
[00:46:00]  A fucking slob.  Pig.  You fucking pig.  And he's like, well, in the end, this is a game.  And most people that are on The Biggest Loser, they understand it's a game, but they're really there to really try to change their fucking lives.  And this guy, you know, had a reason to fucking just fill his fat fucking face.  That's why that show Heavy is, it's not a game.  There's not a contest.  These are people that are ready to die if they don't lose fucking weight. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, this guy I'm talking about is ready to die.  Yeah.  But they present it still in the game format.  This is like a doctor, a real doctor, they go to.  And this guy's a no-nonsense.  He doesn't, it looks like he doesn't even want to be on TV.  One of those guys.  He's fucking like, he diagnoses these people.  He gives them a checkup and says like, look, you're going to die from this.  This is going to kill you.  Yeah.  And the people go in, they're like, I've got to make lifestyle change.  That's my fat guy talk. 
[00:47:00]  I've got to make lifestyle change.  It's very good.  Yeah.  Very good.  That's because you've got a lot of fucking weight around you.  Oh, that's great.  It's pulling everything down.  And in the end, you can't breathe at night because there's so much weight around your throat.  The guy I'm talking about from Biggest Loser, his name is, I think, Arthur.  He's such a slob.  Before he came on The Biggest Loser, and The Biggest Loser certainly isn't helping the guy, really.  He's going through the motions.  So he's going to just be one of those fat guys that they have to cut out of his own house.  Yeah.  Take a wall down.  And he has no self-control to the point that he has a pizza joint in his neighborhood that delivers a pie every night without him calling. 
[00:47:30]  They just know it's on automatic delivery?  Automatic delivery.  He goes...  It's like the oil for your house, for your heat.  Is there other people that do this?  I don't think so.  He made a deal with the pizza joint.  Like, you know I'm calling you every day, so let's stop at this horse shit.  I say horse shit a lot.  I'm trying to stop that.  Make it easy.  And he's like, just deliver me a pizza every night at 6 o'clock. 
[00:48:00]  That's...  What a fucking slob.  What a slob is right.  He's making it so easy for himself.  Right.  A pizza.  I mean, who wouldn't love a pizza every night?  I certainly would.  Wonderful.  A whole pizza for himself.  Of course.  Of course.  Not just...  Not for the family.  For him.  These people on heavy...  I think it's more than...  Honestly, I think it's more than a pie.  Now I've got to look it up during the break.  I think it's more than a pie.  Because I don't think a pie satisfies the pie.  Dude, I want pizza badly. 
[00:48:30]  I would eat it right the fuck out.  I love pizza.  I never get to eat it.  Big fat guy on heavy is like, I'm starving.  I'm starving.  I don't know what to do.  I need food.  Live off your fat.  And they're giving you like...  I think they gave him anywhere between 1,200 and 2,000 calories a day.  Right.  And this guy was used to literally 16,000 to 20,000 calories a day.  Wow.  Yeah.  Just bizarre amounts of fucking food. 
[00:49:00]  And he was crying.  Just whiners.  And then the woman talking about...  When my husband left me, right when the divorce papers were signed, I started eating.  Yeah.  Did you?  Yeah.  Look at what it did to you.  Can we talk about Wendy?  It's my favorite fat story ever.  Oh, God.  The Snapple Lady.  The Snapple Lady.  When our pal was on...  What was the name of that show?  Another fat fuck show. 
[00:49:30]  They asked Norton to do it.  And Norton said, fuck you.  Yeah, they offered me 70 grand, I think.  It was...  What the hell was the name of it?  Not the Biggest Loser.  Oh, thank you, E-Rock.  Celebrity Fit Club.  Right.  And the Snapple Lady was on.  And she had one of the moments I had just said.  And I have to bring it up every time.  And I'm sorry you've heard this a million times out there.  But she got fat because her parents brought another child into the world.  Had a fucking...  That was her excuse for overeating.  A little sister.  Yeah.  And she's like... 
[00:50:00]  I just didn't feel the attention anymore.  I was their little girl.  And then...  Danny, can we find that clip today, please?  Wow.  We haven't played in a while.  Shove food in your face.  I understand some people go through traumatic things and it comes out in the fact that you  got to eat or whatever.  You know, you're touched or whatever.  Yeah.  But because your parents brought home another baby?  Yeah.  Now you're...  That's what sent you overeating?  Losing your fucking mind?  Sent you down the road of overeating?  Losing your fucking mind? 
[00:50:30]  Oh, no.  You fucking slob.  There are so many shows on now with just whiny people.  The hoarders.  The animal hoarders.  The fucking fat slob shows.  Can I tell you the best show on...  I'll tell you the best show on TV right now.  What is it?  I'll stake my claim.  It's Idiot Abroad.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And Idiot Abroad is the best show on TV.  I've never seen it.  Although I could do without Ricky Gervais over the top laughing.  He's doing that a little... 
[00:51:00]  You noticed?  Thank you.  Someone else noticed.  That's why I'm not watching it because I watched like the preview episode and I felt like Gervais  was trying to sell Carl like so much that I just wasn't interested.  I was just like, you know what?  No, thanks.  What are you?  You were in my house.  The exact same discussion I had.  I'm like, I think Ricky Gervais, because this guy Carl is an unknown and he's funny,  but I don't know if he knows he's funny, but he's funny.  I can't even explain Carl, Danny.  But I feel like Ricky Gervais is worried that the world's not going to understand Carl. 
[00:51:30]  So he's overselling it by having this over-the-top laugh.  And I love Ricky Gervais.  Don't fucking misread me.  But it seems like he's doing something that he doesn't have to do.  It's an over-the-top laugh.  We get it.  You don't have to put it.  It's almost like a canned laugh.  Yeah, maybe you can find the preview.  Please laugh here.  An idiot abroad.  He's going to the seven wonders of the world.  He's been to the Great Wall of China so far.  He's been to the Taj Mahal. 
[00:52:00]  And I haven't seen the Jordan episode yet where he goes to the Middle East.  I don't know what Carl Pickering his name is, right?  It's fucking great TV, man.  Oh, it was round head.  This week he goes to Mexico.  And he doesn't want to be there.  And how he describes people, it's just brilliant.  It really is brilliant.  Oh, there it is.  The preview episode, Danny, was a little rough.  You've got to get into the show.  They decided to make a whole show of what the show's about.  Oh, really?  Because it felt like they had to sell it to everybody.  That's kind of what I bailed on. 
[00:52:30]  No, go into the regular episodes because Ricky Gervais isn't in it as much.  It's just him traveling.  I mean, I love Gervais too, but it was just like, I was watching that preview episode and  it actually turned me off.  Like, it was the preview episode and then the premiere.  China?  I don't know.  I didn't watch it.  I watched the preview episode and I was so annoyed by it.  I was like, fuck this.  I'm not watching this.  Wow.  I love this fucking show.  Let me see a moment of it.  I just don't want to...  We've made a brand new series in which we send Carl around the world.  I'm going to say the name of the seven wonders.  I want you to just tell me in a few words your gut reaction. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, gut reaction isn't wise because it still hasn't settled.  Now, if I eat that and I start gagging, you'll think I'm rude.  It is the funniest documentary I've ever seen.  He hates anything foreign.  I can't be bothered.  Everything different.  Is everyone going to be wearing this?  Oh, I just did something crack.  It's like a game of Jenga that's got out of hand.  Did you say it's poisonous or it's not poisonous? 
[00:53:30]  What's that?  I knew he'd hate it and that's why I did it.  Just let me go home.  You are the strangest man on the planet.  I'm into China.  What a useless round-headed drunk.  You hear that laugh?  He does that a lot, Anthony.  A lot.  And I'm surprised because Ricky Gervais is obviously...  He's brilliant in his own right.  And you would think he would realize, oh shit, maybe I did that a little too much.  I got to back off that.  Maybe he did.  Do you have a clip of him talking about... 
[00:54:00]  Carl talking about Chinese people?  He describes Chinese people brilliantly.  And I don't want to...  China deleted scenes in any...  I have no idea.  The Chinese episode's great.  Yeah.  How he describes Chinese people.  If you can find the clip...  You know what?  Do it during the break and we'll come back and we'll play that for everybody.  How they do things backwards and they just...  Their whole culture is to make things more complicated and...  I'm rarely grossed out watching television, but in the Chinese episode when they show people 
[00:54:30]  eating eggs with, like, the fetuses in the eggs still.  Like, that's how they eat eggs.  Like, with the...  Yeah.  Like, chicken fetuses.  Ah, yeah.  Come on now.  It's disgusting.  They let them cook a little bit, meaning let them develop.  And then they fucking...  They show the guy peeling the eggshell and it's a fetus.  And Carl's sitting there like, what the fuck?  Is it still in, like, snotty egg stuff?  Yes.  Yeah.  And they're just sitting at, like, an outdoor cafe or whatever they have in China that's  like an outdoor cafe.  Just...  It has...  Fetus eggs? 
[00:55:00]  It has some bones and the development of bones and some...  Come on.  Why?  It's disgusting.  And some feathers.  Why are they doing that?  And the start of feathers.  And this guy is eating it like it's a delicacy.  That is fucking disgusting.  Can we get those?  I want Iraq to try one of those.  Oh, God.  We're not surprised, though, right?  They have...  Can we go to Chinatown?  Do they sell those?  They must.  I mean...  That's something that Iraq's got to try.  Iraq hasn't tried a bad food in a while.  Well...  Then again...  Anything really bad for...  I'll eat it. 
[00:55:30]  And also that they show, like, the beginning of the Great Wall of China.  Like, I've never seen where it actually begins.  Where it starts.  Yeah.  You always see the wall.  You never see where it starts.  No, and they show both...  You know, both beginnings.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  No, no.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Oh, uh...  Let me say hi to...  It's the beginning of the wall.  It's the longest where it starts.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  You gotta watch this show. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, it's a very high...  Yeah.  He looks very thin, Ricky.  He really did lose a lot of fucking weight.  He's going Hollywood.  Uh, Jack in Chicago.  Jack?  Yeah, hey, old bye guys.  Oh, but you see, when he went to the Taj Mahal in India, they had that one holy man who  has had his arm raised above his head for 25 years, and it's all shriveled up like an  old tree branch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He had his arm over his head for 20 years.  But, I don't know...  Was he born that way?  I couldn't figure that out.  No, he decided to do that. 
[00:56:30]  You can't do that physically.  He's doing it.  And his arm is completely destroyed.  Because he can't get any blood up there?  I wasn't sure...  He's doing it for God or something.  His culture or his religion, and I wasn't sure if he was born that way, or...  You're telling me he wasn't born that way?  No, he's been...  He's doing it.  His arm is completely useless.  I bet he was called on in school a lot when he started.  Well, he never got called on.  That's why his arm stayed up so long.  You dummy.  I never got picked to be in the magic shows when I was a boy.  It's not worth crying.  Magic shows. 
[00:57:00]  When I wanted to be in the show where the magician was doing my friend's birthday party,  and I kept yelling, me, me, pick me, me, me.  Oh, no.  And he went to everyone but me.  Of course.  Who would pick the kid yelling, me, me, me?  Yeah, exactly.  Because you'd want it to be all about me, me, me.  Yeah, it would have been a problem.  Meanwhile, the magician is like, no, it's about me.  Yeah, he was smart.  Hey, we'll break.  If you could find Carl describing Chinese people, that would be great for everybody.  But an idiot abroad, I'm fucking all in with this show.  Hey, we got Nick. 
[00:57:30]  Nick Swartzen's here.  Did you hear it already?  Okay.  Yeah, he came a little early, so we'll get him in next.  He's in the big Adam Sandler movie that they had their premiere here in New York yesterday.  Ah.  Talked to Nick about it.  Nick was hilarious in the movie.  You know Nick?  Oh, yeah, for years.  I liked it a lot.  Yeah, Nick Swartzen's a very funny guy, and we'll have him in next.  Hi, this is Ricky Gervais, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  I have no idea why you do that, but hey, your life.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony on The Virus Sirius XM.  Got Nick Swartzen walking down the hall from Just Go With It in theaters this Friday. 
[00:58:00]  It's a rom-com.  Although I said that to Brooklyn Decker, and she goes, it's more than a rom-com. 
[00:58:30]  Well, she's going to say that.  It's a rom-com with jokes.  I would say it.  And Nick Swartzen is hilarious in the movie.  That's the com part of the rom-com.  Yeah, exactly.  What's up, Nick?  What's up, dude?  Hey, bro.  How are you, bro?  How are you?  Aw, Nick knows Jimmy.  How are you, man?  Good.  Goody good.  What's up, man?  Throw it over.  High five.  Congratulations on Just Go With It.  You are really fucking funny in this movie, man.  Oh, thanks, man.  I saw it last week, and Nick...  It's so ridiculous. 
[00:59:00]  My part is so retarded.  Yeah, but you just steal scenes from everybody when you appear on the big screen there.  Oh, thanks, dude.  Yeah, I mean, I just come in and just...  My character, I play like Sandler's cousin, and then I pretend to be Jennifer Aniston's  fake husband.  His name is Dolph Lundgren, and I just do like this weird Austrian accent that makes  no sense, and I just run around like being an idiot.  Wearing like thick glasses and like... 
[00:59:30]  Glasses you can't see through.  You can't see at all.  I don't know.  But you have to describe something.  Describing stuff is the worst.  It's awful.  We have to describe something.  Especially like when you're on a press, too, and you're just describing stuff all the time,  and you're just like, oh, God.  You know what?  I officially love Nick.  He's going to be in a huge movie, and he just horribly described it.  Yeah.  He doesn't give a fuck.  I'll tell you why.  He doesn't care.  Pure actors could come in and describe it beautifully, but comics, we have such a sense of shame  all the time. 
[01:00:00]  I just...  I just did.  It's constant, constant shame and self-loathing.  The movie's going to do unbelievable numbers, and he's like, oh, yeah, that's not this fucking...  I'm reading between the lines.  I just...  I don't like watching myself do anything.  You don't?  No.  No?  Not even in a big...  That's a pretty big movie.  It's a big movie.  The movie's great.  I will enjoy everything about something except for what I do.  Really?  I'm like, I can appreciate...  I think everyone's great in the movie.  Dave Matthews is hilarious, and Nicole Kidman. 
[01:00:30]  All these people are really funny, and then I just watch myself.  Nealon's always hilarious.  Kevin Nealon's in it for two minutes, and he almost steals the entire movie.  He's fucking hilarious.  He plays a guy who goes through a ton of plastic surgery, and he literally had to go through  like five hours of stretching his face back every day.  Yeah, almost unrecognizable, but you just know it's him.  It's horrifying.  And his face doesn't move because he had so much plastic surgery.  And so he's at a cocktail party, and he has a drink, and the drink just falls out of his mouth 
[01:01:00]  because he can't even close his lips.  He has so much surgery.  It made me laugh hard, man.  Yeah, his part's amazing.  You made me laugh really hard.  Fucking Brooklyn Decker in a bikini.  I was surprised at Jennifer Aniston's body when she finally showed her body.  What are you saying?  Holy shit.  Yeah.  You think she works out?  Oh, my God.  That's a really dumb question.  A guy who doesn't know what to ask.  Have you met Adam?  A guy who wants to ask questions, but has no idea what to ask.  And I was talking about the scene the other day.  It took balls on her part because you got Brooklyn Decker. 
[01:01:30]  She's just ridiculous.  Swimsuit model, and she's half naked in most of the movie.  And all of a sudden, Jennifer Aniston goes, yeah, I want to go for a swim, too.  And she takes her fucking shirt and her little jean shorts off, and you're like, what the fuck?  Yeah, like flawless.  And she's totally a big reveal.  Yeah, she's totally competing with the young Brooklyn Decker as far as the body goes.  How old is she?  Like, 43?  41, 42?  41, 42, I think.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Like, she's flawless.  It's insane.  Yeah.  And in that scene, by the way, so they fucking Brooklyn runs, dives into the water. 
[01:02:00]  Can I swear?  Oh, yeah.  I can't remember.  So Brooklyn dives into this, she was in her bikini, dives into this waterfall, and then  Aniston goes and dives into this waterfall, and Sandler goes, he's like, hey, Nick.  And I'm like, what?  And he goes, you know what would be funny just to try it?  And I'm like, what?  And he goes, just fucking take off your clothes, dude, and just run butt naked, and just do  like a splits, and just try to land on your balls in the water.  And I was like, what? 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, why?  And he's like, just try it, let's just see, maybe we'll use it.  I'm like, we're not going to fucking use it, dude.  You know we're not going to be able to use that.  It's a PG-13 movie.  He's like, just try it!  I'm like, so in front of everybody, like, these two girls are just sitting there watching,  the whole crew, I'm like, fuck me.  And there's like always paparazzi around, because of Aniston and stuff, so I just was  like, this is going to be the worst shot ever.  I hope this never appears.  So I had to do it.  Oh, man.  Of course, no, it didn't make it.  How cold was the water? 
[01:03:00]  Because you want to present properly.  Present?  Yeah.  It was horrifying.  Wow, he's a dick.  Yeah, it's great.  Adam's a dick.  No, he's nice.  I would do the same thing.  I'm just fucking.  I'm not going to fuck up your relationship, but I'm saying, don't worry.  But the beauty, that's exactly what I would do if I had a film company.  I'm like, just try this.  You know it's not going to go.  Do it.  It's going to be in some gag reel someday, right?  Oh, it's going to be somewhere.  Were you uncomfortable being naked in front of people, or no?  I might actually like that.  I'm a complete creep.  Really?  Yeah, man.  I might enjoy that, except my stomach. 
[01:03:30]  What, you would enjoy getting naked in front of Jennifer Aniston in Brooklyn?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, except for my stomach.  I'd love to be bottomless in front of them.  Like, shirtless, I'd be humiliated.  Wow.  My fat stomach.  Just bottomless, presenting nicely.  Not even that, but it's just not awful.  But my stomach is terrible, so that would be nice.  Hey, would you be able to do that?  I would not be able to do that.  I don't know how much I've had to drink.  Probably, yeah, of course.  You know, I'd do it for nothing with enough, you know.  Adam would have to tell me to put my clothes back on.  Like, all right, look, they saw it.  They were impressed.  You can collect your thoughts.  Did you go to the big premiere last night? 
[01:04:00]  I did not.  No, I missed it.  I flew in late.  I landed like, no, I missed the whole thing.  Oh, damn.  That sucks.  I don't have to start from there, bud.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah.  You would think you would, like, maybe get in early and go to the premiere for the movie.  Sam, for some reason, was just like, you know, I don't know.  He was like, don't worry about it.  Because I've been running around doing a bunch of stuff, so he was like, I don't know.  He's like, save your energy.  I was going to try to do a red eye and shit.  Don't show up.  Don't show up at the premiere, please.  Nick, you're a big part of the movie.  You should have been there.  I know.  I don't know.  It's fine.  Fuck. 
[01:04:30]  He didn't take it as a bad thing, though.  He didn't go, no, no, you don't have to come.  That wasn't negative, right?  As a matter of fact, don't show up.  Yeah.  You know what?  It would be great if he just showed all the outtakes and every angle of me fucking my balls in the water.  He's like, it was actually just a whole prank on me.  It was 45 minutes of the movie.  It was your bag.  Just slow motion of my sack, just grazing this beautiful, palatial Hawaiian waterfall.  Yeah, you guys got to go to Hawaii for how long?  Two months.  It was insane. 
[01:05:00]  That's good shit.  All my friends, this was the thing where my friends were like, all right, we fucking hate you.  Yeah.  Like, you know, I've done other stuff, and they're like, oh, it's cool.  So this one was like two months in Hawaii, Anniston, Brooklyn Decker, Nicole Kidman, everyone's half naked.  And then like Dave Matthews and fucking like Dan Patrick.  Yeah.  It was like a wet dream.  How did Nicole look?  She seemed like she's really sexy.  I mean, dude, insane.  There's like a hula scene with her and Anniston, and they're both in like grass skirts.  Her abs, they're like fucking robot abs. 
[01:05:30]  She looks like an avatar or something.  It's like insane.  I thought there was some movie magic with the abs.  Really?  Yeah, they were so insane.  Like 300?  None, dude.  None.  They're like deep ruts on the side.  Yeah.  Like chiseled.  It's insane.  But it doesn't look manly.  You know what I mean?  Got any of that, Danny?  Yeah, there should be a shot of that.  This is Nicole Kidman.  Nicole Kidman.  How old is she?  She's in her 40s, right?  She's got to be in her 40s.  Yeah.  Has to be.  That's a...  Situation.  Immediately the situation came up. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, they showed a situation.  Come on.  All right.  We get it.  Although he was really nice when he came in.  Yeah.  He was at the Super Bowl.  I was just there and that dude was everywhere and caused like the biggest frenzy.  Yeah, she does have some...  Yeah.  You can see it on the side.  Yeah, it's insane.  Yeah.  Is she tall and thin?  Yeah.  She looks it.  She used to be so hot.  How long has she been divorced from Cruise?  It's like eight years, nine years?  I don't know.  Her face is a little tight. 
[01:06:30]  Really?  Sorry, Nick.  Nick's not saying that.  I hate not saying a word.  I know I'll never be in a movie.  I can say this shit.  But I might be.  Yeah.  I said it.  Jimmy didn't say it.  No, I'm a terrible actor.  Fucking...  Yeah, her body's ridiculous.  What other movies have you done?  Any?  Nick's done a bunch, right?  Yeah.  I've done a bunch with Sandler and did like...  What else did I do?  Blades of Glory.  Reno 911 movie.  And then like Sandler's...  Like Zohan, Chuck and Larry, all that stuff. 
[01:07:00]  Zohan was...  Grandma's boy.  I really liked Zohan.  Yeah, I liked Zohan.  It was hilarious.  Yeah.  It was funny because we did the...  We had like a screening in LA and just fucking people were just watching it.  Like just confused.  Let me screen it in New York.  And like everyone got it.  Like the New York screening was like amazing.  It's like Star Wars.  People are like, oh my God, hummus!  Ew!  I get depressed when I'm in LA, man.  Like I'm going out this week and I go for a few days at a time, but I get really depressed. 
[01:07:30]  There is a different head out there.  But it's not that it's bad.  I enjoy it.  But I just get very...  I get lazy and I eat a lot and I'm fucking...  I'm really...  I don't function well.  You eat a lot in LA?  I'm unhealthier in LA because my routine is broken up.  Yeah, I get fat in LA.  When I stay out there for any length of time...  How the fuck do you do that?  In what restaurant?  Because you don't walk anywhere.  Oh, that's it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Jesus.  Oh, yeah.  Who's the one on the end wrecking the shot?  That's the gag, man.  Fucking Aniston.  Jesus.  I don't know what E-Rock was in the movie. 
[01:08:00]  She has a great body.  Dude, Dan Patrick called that woman big country.  Remember the old basketball player at Oklahoma?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  That's a couple of...  We're looking at...  A couple of nice ages.  A video of the hula scene with Aniston.  From E.T.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Exclusive.  Exclusive.  We have exclusive footage.  Fun.  Fun stuff.  I hate those fucking shows.  Did you learn to hate the paparazzi?  Um, I... 
[01:08:30]  I don't know.  I just...  It was just so weird.  It's not something I'm used to, really.  They have a function.  I mean, celebrities like them on some level because they do get promotion out for the movie.  Yeah.  They'll show a shot.  Like, they showed shots of Sandler.  And so people already talk about the movie before it comes out, you know.  Yeah.  I mean, it does serve a purpose.  I actually was never into it.  And then, uh...  I lost my car.  I got drunk and lost my car.  And, uh...  Ha, ha.  And, uh...  I thought it was stolen, legitimately. 
[01:09:00]  So I called my insurance company.  I'm like,  My car's been stolen!  And, uh...  And I was walking down the street.  And I just, like, just started drinking, like, more.  Just confused.  Yeah, you know.  About how to find my car.  And TMZ found me on the street.  Like, what are you doing?  I'm like, I lost my car.  So they put it on the air and on the website and everything.  And then somebody called me and they found my car.  So TMZ, like, actually helped me find my car, which is insane.  Exactly.  Dude, where's my car?  That was my life.  How, uh...  How does TMZ fucking know? 
[01:09:30]  How do they know everything?  How does everybody get them everything?  Well, there's a whole bunch of guys that are just freelancing.  Constantly, dude.  They're freelancers and then they give it to TMZ.  Oh.  That's how that works.  You don't see that when you go to L.A.?  They're everywhere.  I've seen them.  I've talked to TMZ briefly.  But it's like, I don't know.  I was wondering how do they get all the...  Or Radar Online now gets a lot.  I forget people send it in.  But then these guys, correct me if I'm wrong, Nick,  they know, like, TMZ's the hot one right now.  So these freelancers will go up to, like, say you, Jimmy, 
[01:10:00]  and go, TMZ, when they're not officially TMZ,  they're hoping what they get with you,  they're going to, you know, send over to TMZ, right?  Right.  And they also have guys on staff, too, of course.  Yeah, but they have guys everywhere.  It's insane.  They just drive around.  They'll drive around Beverly Hills.  They'll drive around places where people, you know,  like usually famous people hang out.  I mean, they just, like, they just cover so much ground.  Well, I love the people that walk.  Is it Robertson?  Yeah.  Robertson is a road in L.A. that is the paparazzi hangout, 
[01:10:30]  and celebrities know if I walk down Robertson,  I'm going to get, you know, filmed.  But what makes me laugh really hard is when they're on Robertson,  they're like, ah, you know, they're covering their face.  It's so embarrassing.  No, no, no.  I can't believe this.  But everyone in L.A.  Nick knows.  Everyone in L.A. knows if you're going down Robertson,  you've got to expect that someone's going to take your picture or video you.  But then they make believe, like, oh, my God, I can't go anywhere.  It's embarrassing.  Like certain restaurants, too, where, like, paparazzi are always at. 
[01:11:00]  The Ivy.  It's like, oh, really?  You had to fucking eat at the Ivy?  Right, right.  That's your go-to.  That's your McDonald's.  And then they make believe they're annoyed as they're leaving the Ivy.  Like, I can't believe they found me here.  Get out of here.  What?  Stop.  Stop.  If you're in L.A., you certainly could hide.  There's plenty of places to go where the paparazzi are.  There's a billion.  For the valley.  Hang out in the valley.  No one's going to go there.  No one's going to go to the valley, dude.  Well, I lived on Robertson for one night when I went out to do Lucky Louie. 
[01:11:30]  My manager.  Was that the cockroach place?  That was the cockroach place.  It was on Robertson.  Oh, okay.  What?  Yeah.  It was on, I forget, Robertson, and when I rented a place, it was a small place,  and my manager would help find it, and he tends to be scatterbrained.  Oh, God.  And I checked, and I put my stuff in, and I saw a roach in the kitchen, and I was like,  ah, fuck.  And the whole place smelled like bug spray.  And then I saw one more in the kitchen.  I saw about six in the kitchen, and then I saw one in the bedroom on the fucking wall,  and I saw one with the lights on.  By a million.  And one in the rug with the lights on. 
[01:12:00]  Are you sure those weren't paparazzi?  Yeah.  That's really good.  They had little cameras.  And I had to fly the next day to fucking middle of Canada to be Voss's best man at his dumb wedding.  So I had to take all my stuff, and my manager at two in the morning, I'm screaming at him,  I'm like, you've got to get me a hotel, I'll pay for a hotel for two weeks, I can't stay here.  So I just put all my possessions in a storage in a hotel, and went and was Voss's best man  in a fucking hunting lodge in the middle of Canada.  But that was on Robertson.  I didn't know that was such a celebrity spot.  I've been out there a million times on the show.  Were you afraid they were going to crawl into your shit? 
[01:12:30]  I didn't know, man.  You don't want to leave your stuff with roaches there.  That's what I mean.  That's disgusting.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Bed bugs are worse, but roaches are bad.  I think bed bugs are harder to get rid of than roaches.  Yeah, if you have it either.  What happened to the bed bugs?  They're still huge.  They're all over the place.  Are they really?  The school's are being like infestation.  They don't do the stories anymore on the news, though.  I guess we're done with bed bugs.  When you walk down the street, you'll see a mattress or something wrapped up, and it  will say BB on it, or don't touch bed bugs.  Because it's bad.  So what is the deal?  They get it in your asshole, or what? 
[01:13:00]  I don't know.  I'm sure eventually.  You wouldn't want that.  That's probably not where they start.  They probably go for the ears and the mouth.  But you can't get rid of them.  They just bite you.  You can't get rid of them?  No, you can't get rid of them.  They're fucking horrible.  Out of your body?  Out of your apartment.  No, no.  Yeah, they're just everywhere.  And the bites they leave just make you itch uncontrollably.  You have to bring the heat up in your apartment or house, or bring it really down.  So a lot of people get these industrial heaters, well, they hire companies, with industrial 
[01:13:30]  heaters, with these big tubes that go in your doors, your windows and shit, and they bring  the heat of your house up to like 150 degrees.  And then it kills everything.  It kills all the bedbugs.  Yeah.  That's how they do it?  Yeah.  What does the dumb dog do, then?  The dog tells you if you have bedbugs.  Which is the greatest scam ever.  Of course it is.  Yeah, like the dog knows.  That has to be a scam.  It's got to be.  They bring a dog in, and if it barks a certain way, they're like, yep, you've got bedbugs,  without even finding one.  That's a big scam. 
[01:14:00]  You've got bedbugs.  And then the guy with the heating unit that Ant's describing comes in.  See, the heat or freezing, because sometimes in some contained areas, like just the bed,  they'll freeze shit, and they'll take this refrigerant and just kind of spray it all  over your bed and your couch.  Do you see them come out of hiding?  No, I think they just die instantly.  Do they smell when they die?  No, they're too small.  They're not small dogs.  They have tiny little maggots in their body.  It's not like they found a hoarder after a month.  That'd be great if you just heard tiny screams. 
[01:14:30]  Just really shrewd.  That'd be fantastic.  I want to make sure we promote the movie properly, because it's good, man.  And Nick's going to...  Thanks, dude.  Yeah, it's this Friday.  Yeah, it's this Friday.  Just go with it.  And like I said, you stole so many of the scenes.  So many of the fucking scenes in this movie.  My character's...  Nick's a good actor, though.  We were on a reel together years ago.  We had the same manager here in New York, Barry Katz.  Scary Katz?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:15:00]  Exactly.  Barry.  You were a Barry guy?  I was there for six years.  Everyone does a great Barry.  You're unstoppable, man.  Wow.  Just empty, empty words.  It's always like, hey, man, you're on fire, man.  You're going to explode.  I'm like, what does that even mean?  My favorite Barry Katz story is I was fucking broke.  I moved to LA.  I don't know if I told you this, Jim.  I moved to LA.  I have no money.  I moved to a studio apartment shithole off the beach. 
[01:15:30]  And I have no money.  And I needed a microwave.  So I go to Barry's wedding.  And he goes, hey, man, I got five microwaves for his wedding.  So I go, hey, I really need one.  He goes, all right, I'll give you one for $100.  I'm like, that's more than a fucking microwave cost.  What a prick.  And he sold, he's my manager.  He sold me a microwave for $100.  Barry, what are you doing?  That's Barry, though.  $100.  Dollars.  I still like Barry.  I mean, he's not my manager anymore. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, no, we're still friends.  But a lot of guys hate him.  I don't hate him.  I can never hate him.  I always like talking to him.  It's like if you think you want to, but then you talk to him, it's like, hey, you can't.  He's very engaging.  Everyone in comedy knows him and has an impression of him.  Like, Jay does a great Barry impression.  Jay does a great one.  Milan Gold does a great Barry, too.  Nick's is pretty good, too.  Yeah, Nick has a good...  I want to tell the people it's the impression that no one knows, but it's right.  It's dead on.  It's dead on with these guys. 
[01:16:30]  Didn't Chappelle do him in his show, too?  Like, he had a sketch about a manager.  Wait, Elan played him, I think.  Oh, was it?  Oh, right, right.  Okay.  He gets pushed down the steps in a wheelchair or something.  In a wheelchair, yeah.  Some awful thing.  That's right, man.  And it was like, this is what we want to happen to you, so throw it in the movie.  They have bad blood.  But Barry is really weird.  I'm telling you, man, he has a good eye, because at one point he had Chapali at Brewer.  He had Daryl Hammond.  He had Tracy Morgan. 
[01:17:00]  Like, Barry has had some...  A lot of fucking...  Jay.  He had Dane.  Caliendo.  Caliendo.  I was with him.  You were with him.  Why all had?  I know.  Literally.  Why is it all...  Hey, he had...  Some are probably business moves, but other times people just move on.  They just move on, you know, for whatever reasons.  Somebody sells them a line, and it sounds better than what you got, and people go to the next guy.  Who's still with him?  Jay's still with him, right?  I think Dane is, too.  And Dane?  Barry doesn't need anybody.  If he's got Dane money coming in, he doesn't need anybody. 
[01:17:30]  I know Caliendo left him, which I was surprised.  Did Frank leave?  Yeah.  I never knew Frank.  I think Frank was with him probably after I was.  I bet he did a good impression of him, too.  You know what?  I was looking...  I was in...  When I was in Vegas with my girlfriend, we were walking through the Monte Carlo, and I was just looking  at Frank's name on the billboard, and he's probably bored doing the same thing every night.  Yeah, I bet.  That's got to be nice fucking...  That's got to be a nice hunk of money.  I already got, like, millions.  Wouldn't you be bored doing, like, that whole every night?  Yes.  Two shows, and then...  Yeah.  Even though, you know, oh, we got a casino gig. 
[01:18:00]  It's great.  Good money and shit, but, like, just the same shit night after night?  I know.  That'd be...  I don't know.  That'd be hard.  Especially impressions, too, because you're just, like...  Yeah.  I don't know, man.  You just turn into, like...  Yeah, what are you going to do?  That can't be fulfilling.  Yeah, you're, like, Rich Little.  It's like, you're probably really 40.  But I hear he's a little bored out there with the town and stuff, so I don't know how much  longer he'll do that.  Yeah.  I'm speculating now.  I saw him at the Super Bowl, and he seemed kind of a little, like, over it.  I love the Vegas thing.  Yeah.  Or everything. 
[01:18:30]  He's too young for that.  Or everything.  I like how it's great.  Frank's just looking for a shotgun with a telepatch.  He does a great Charles Barkley, man.  Did you see the Charles Barkley?  Does he?  I haven't seen that.  He did it during the pregame for the Super Bowl.  How was the Super Bowl?  Any stories from out there?  We're down there?  It was just mayhem.  I've never been to a Super Bowl, and it was, you know, it was Dallas, but it was fucking  free.  It was like it is here in New York.  It was freezing.  So that was kind of weird, but it was just crazy.  Because everyone goes. 
[01:19:00]  So it's like every musician, rapper, athlete, actor.  It just was like, it was system kind of overload.  Did you get, did you have good seats?  Yeah, we had a box, which was cool.  That stadium's retarded with that LED screen.  It's like gigantic, and it's like, I don't know, man.  The stadium was pretty badass.  It was pretty cool.  Were you watching the screen with the game on the game?  I was kind of, got stuck watching the screen.  Which is fucked up.  It's like, yeah.  I know.  But it's so huge.  It's huge.  Can you wrap your mind around it? 
[01:19:30]  No.  When you see it for the first time?  No, it's, it was, and the thing about it is it was packed.  It was 102,000 people.  Right.  And you're just like, I was just in awe of the whole thing.  Yeah.  Who did you see the, do you get pictures with people?  Because you meet a lot of celebrities.  Do you get photos, or do you never get photos?  I don't, I never do.  I just don't, even if it's somebody I worship, I always just space.  You're the opposite of Jimmy.  Yeah.  How do you wrap your mind around that screen?  That looks like a piece of one photo was cut out. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, it looks like a Photoshop.  You know that's up in the Super Bowl, because the fucking Cowboys are in it.  Cocksuckers.  Stupid Jerry Jones.  What stands out as far as that stadium goes, besides the screen?  Just the massive amount of seats.  Yeah.  And just the massive amount of people.  Yeah.  It's just so huge.  And there's, the weird thing is there's several gay bars in it, which was really jarring.  Really?  I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  Interesting.  Several.  That would be a bad one. 
[01:20:30]  That would just be.  What dummies we are.  We bought right into it.  It was just such an odd thing that I assumed it had to be true.  That would be amazing.  Several is the key word, though.  Not just one.  Yeah, there wasn't one.  There was several.  You could go gay bar hopping in the stadium.  In Texas stadium.  There's something for me.  Nick's funny.  He should be in movies.  Jesus, that's really funny.  Who did you want to meet that you met and that you worshipped, but you didn't, you kind  of spaced on it?  I'm a big, big sports fan, so any athlete, I'm always like, oh. 
[01:21:00]  Hi.  Are you the safety for the Chiefs?  You meet safety.  You meet LeBron?  I did not meet LeBron.  Biggest athlete you ever met?  Wow.  Who's the biggest athlete I met?  Oh, I became friends with Aaron Rodgers.  So I got pictures with Aaron Rodgers.  So I was psyched about that.  The MVP of the Super Bowl?  The what?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, that guy.  I was super pumped.  I met him at a charity event a couple years ago.  We've been friends ever since. 
[01:21:30]  So that was like, I was super fired up for him.  He's a great fucking dude.  I never become friends with celebrities, which is mostly at their request.  I say hi, I get a photo, and I'm done.  And then he leaves.  He doesn't want to say.  Then he doesn't want to talk to the celebrity anymore.  I think the photo is the thing that fucks it up for you.  Of course it is.  I know that.  Like, don't take the photo and just have, like, kind of a break the ice conversation.  I met De Niro twice.  I haven't gotten a photo.  We're not friends.  Set the bar a little lower, okay?  We're not friends, though.  Don't start with De Niro and your friend-making process. 
[01:22:00]  But you know what I mean?  Because you can make a celebrity friend without a photo.  How about Rob Schneider first, and then maybe you could move on from there?  I've actually never met him.  I don't even know how you could.  I've met him.  I can't even imagine befriending De Niro off a meeting.  Like, just meeting him for the first time.  Yeah, yeah.  And be like, hey, give me a call.  What are you doing?  Yeah, what do you say to him that goes, well, I really would like to hang out with this guy.  I know I'd slip up, too.  I'd be doing great all night, and I would wind up just going, all right, we'll look.  Taxi driver!  I would just scream one of his raging body.  I would just fuck it up at the end. 
[01:22:30]  You'd fuck it up.  That was random, like, and you'd be like, all right.  Oh, yeah, I remember that one.  The fan!  It's like, all right.  Like, Opie fucked up his relationship with Obama in his dream.  Yeah, I did.  I was too needy.  That's one of the best dumb-ass dream stories I've ever heard.  I was becoming really good friends with Obama in my dream, but then I got too needy.  And he goes, I'm going to call you.  You know, we were at a bar or something.  And then I had to be like, really?  You're definitely going to call?  Because, you know, I...  Like, wasn't he walking away, and he goes, I'll call you? 
[01:23:00]  And then you, like, as he's further away, you went, like, something like, hey, you know,  call me.  Yeah, yeah.  You were like that kid in Saturday Night Fever to Travolta.  Call me, Tony!  Tony, you're going to call me?  And then in the dream, he gave that look like, oh, I'll never call him.  Oh, no.  At the last minute.  He's a little too needy.  You blew it.  Yeah, I blew it.  Yeah.  I could have been friends with Obama in my dreams.  Dream Obama.  You could have had your dream friend.  That's a good dream friend.  That's a good dream friend.  Dream pal.  Yeah, that is a good one.  It doesn't make Anthony happy, I have a dream friend with Obama.  Well, I didn't vote for the gentleman, but, you know, I respect the office. 
[01:23:30]  That's what I say.  But would you vote for him in your dreams?  In dream land?  That's a good question.  Yeah.  That's a very relevant question.  That would...  I probably would, and then I'd wake up in a cold sweat.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Oh, thank God it was a dream.  Check my gun closet, make sure they're all still there, because I have a fear that they're going  to take away my Second Amendment rights, and I don't know.  It has to be a whole thing?  Yeah, it's got to be a whole thing.  Ah!  Ah!  Freedom of speech!  Ah!  You know, I'm a big Alan Alda freak.  I love Alan Alda.  He's one of my heroes for some stupid reason. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  Understandable.  And I met him one time and got a photo with him.  He's very tough to get a photo with, because he's very skittish.  Like, you know, he's been taking photos for 40 years.  He's done.  Yeah.  So I finally got a picture with him, which was very fucking hard to do.  And I wanted to get it signed, so Louis C.K. did a movie with him.  And Louis's like, look, I'll take you to the cast party.  And I didn't know if I could go, so Louis's like, I'll help you get it signed.  So I go, and Alda's actually there.  And I can't approach him.  I just can't.  And so Louis brings me up and introduces me.  Hey, Hawkeye!  Believe me, I knew. 
[01:24:30]  Because he kept talking to people.  I don't know.  But then Louis brings him up and introduces him to me.  He actually heard the radio show.  And he was very nice, and we chatted for a minute.  And he's like, well, I normally don't do autographs.  He goes, but I always do them for cops, firemen, and comedians.  Like, he was very polite, pleasant.  So we started talking about MASH.  And there were certain things I said I liked about MASH, which I know he liked hearing.  Like, certain about language barriers they pushed and content barriers.  But then.  Uh-oh.  You pulled a Costanza.  You unzipped his fly. 
[01:25:00]  I just stayed too long.  That's exactly right.  I didn't butcher it.  Come up in person.  I didn't butcher it hardly.  But there was that one moment.  I don't know what happened.  Oh, no.  Where I do something in my face, and he realized.  Oh, fanboy.  Fanboy asshole.  Not an equal.  Fanboy.  Dude, what was it?  You can't remember?  No, it was the tone of me talking about.  Because I was talking about the language in MASH, and I think I knew too much of the dialogue.  Or something.  Oh, you didn't blurt a line out, did you? 
[01:25:30]  You probably did.  Oh, that'll do it.  Maybe I did.  Either that, or you picked an episode where there was a Korean baby you wanted to fuck.  You remember that one?  What's up with that baby?  Nick knows Jim Norton.  It was just one step too far, and it was nothing over the top.  It was just the tone of what I was saying.  That's why I don't have celebrity friends either, because when you're in the conversation,  you're like, oh my god, I'm doing well, I'm doing well.  And there's a panic, like, okay, don't fucking blow it, don't fucking blow it.  And then, like you said, you always go too far with something, and they realize, oh, 
[01:26:00]  I'm better than you, go fuck yourself.  I have to backdoor friendship into, like, fame.  Like, Kevin Smith I became friends with, and him I'm comfortable with.  Because Kevin is a, he's that kind of guy you can be comfortable with.  Right.  I blew it with Kevin.  Nah, he likes you a lot.  He brought me to a Devils game, and I sat in the box, and I think I might have been a  little too needy with him, too, to be honest.  Really?  We were trading tweet pictures, he's like, hey, I want to tweet this.  I'm like, I want to tweet this.  And then I sat next to him, maybe a little too long, I'm thinking.  He doesn't hate me or anything, but I think I might have blown it. 
[01:26:30]  I think we went back to just being radio friends.  Yeah.  I think so.  Because I never got the invite again.  Did you get hammered?  And I hinted.  Nah, he doesn't really drink, and I don't really drink, so we were just kind of hanging.  And then he was sitting by himself in the box, and I'm like, I'm going to go sit with  him for a little while.  Oh, no, no, no.  But then I realized, don't sit with him too long.  Like, so I'm overthinking the whole thing.  Overthought.  Right.  Yeah.  And I really think I'm going with him.  I still love the guy, and I think we're probably going to just be radio friends.  As far as friends go, yeah.  Yeah, because we did make that step where he invited me to the game for the playoffs, because 
[01:27:00]  he knows I like hockey.  I love hockey.  But you've had a couple of instances where you had, you know, Greg Brady, as a matter  of fact.  I didn't blow up with Greg Brady.  I needed to get the fuck out of that one.  Come on.  That was a great instance.  I went to Greg Brady's house a couple times.  Did you?  A couple times?  Oh, yeah.  I actually like Barry a lot.  I do like him, but...  Well, he seemed to like you a lot.  Yeah, he's a weird dude, man.  Where does he live?  I decided to remove myself from the situation. 
[01:27:30]  He lived at the top of Beverly Hills in this ridiculous house, but it turns out it was because  of his wife's money.  Because he could...  I don't think he's making residual money off that.  They weren't doing residual deals back then, weren't they?  They're not together.  I don't think so.  They're not together anymore, but she was like an international banker, and every time  we came to New York, we went out to dinner, and yeah, we became pretty tight.  But I showed up once at his house with Jay, our old friend Jay, and he served me his leftovers.  Yeah, I went to the fridge for leftovers.  He told me to stop by, so I called him like, hey, I'm in L.A., and he goes, all right, come 
[01:28:00]  on over.  Weren't you drinking like wine on a hillside watching the sunset with him?  Martinis.  You're drinking martinis watching the sunset with just you and Barry Williams?  I mean, if you need to say that to make the show better, by all means, go ahead.  And you can Photoshop the shit out of it.  No, honestly, that's how I remember the story, because maybe that's how I want to remember  it, but what really happened?  Jay was there, and Barry's managers, the two brothers, I forget their names. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, I thought you were having a quiet moment together.  I don't know.  He had an infinity pool, and he wanted me to jump in.  What's an infinity pool?  One of those, those swim pools, right?  No.  It just trails off.  It just trails off.  So it looks like the water just kind of goes forever.  Yeah, there's no lip on the pool.  There's no barrier, yeah.  Right.  Oh, it's like a zero entry pool or something.  And his pool looked like it went right over the cliff.  Wow.  And his wife is there coming out and stuff.  Oh, she actually was really cool.  But it was creepy walking through his house and seeing all the Brady Bunch stuff. 
[01:29:00]  Really weird.  We had Brady Bunch shit all over the place?  Everywhere.  And then he had a whole collection of the Brady Bunch on VHS tapes, I remember.  Jesus Christ.  Just kind of thrown around.  What the fuck?  You know how tired his wife must be of that entire franchise?  Oh, my God.  She's gone.  She's long gone.  Of course she is.  She's long gone, and you know what?  I'm going to show you.  You know what it was?  It was probably one too many times of a conversation.  I'm going, you know, this reminds me of the episode.  And she was just like, I can't fucking handle this anymore.  This is his doorbell. 
[01:29:30]  You're just standing there, all right?  That plays when you walk in the door.  Hey, Obie's here.  Uh-oh, don't go there.  That's what happens if you don't flush the bowl.  His whole house is just fucking sound.  It's just boobies.  It's just Brady traps.  The whole place.  I miss Barry.  We're going to have to have him on.  He works for this company.  We're going to have him in.  Then he can play Robert Reed's Ribs. 
[01:30:00]  You know, because he had AIDS.  I'm just mean.  I'm sure he was a nice man.  Sure.  He had friends up the ass.  Of course he was nice.  You know, that old gag.  The other celebrity friend I had was Dice, but that just became exhausting.  Yeah, yeah.  Dice is hard to be friends with.  And nothing against Dice either.  I love the guy.  He's more than welcome to come in today if he wants to.  But when I was in L.A. and I was hanging out with Dice a little bit here and there,  just going hiking with him was this whole big fucking thing. 
[01:30:30]  You had to do it properly.  Everything is a project with him.  You had to stop every, like, I forgot, a hundred yards to breathe in a certain way.  You've got to hydrate.  I'm like, let's just get to the top of the fucking hill, man.  Hydrate.  But everything he does, there's a method and a way to do it.  It's exhausting.  Yeah.  We went to the supermarket because he goes, I'm going to cook for you.  And we went to the supermarket and that was a whole fucking big deal.  I don't know.  He couldn't just, like, pick up shit.  He's got to cause a scene at the meat aisle and the fucking fruit aisle.  I'm like, can we just get the fuck out of here? 
[01:31:00]  He's an exhausting man.  And then I went to the gym with him and there's monsters in there.  And I know my way around the gym.  I'm not a, you know, but I kind of know my way around.  And he's lifting 10 pounds.  I'm like, in front of monsters.  He goes, no, this is the way to do this.  I'm like, we look like idiots.  But I think he wanted us to look like idiots.  He's a big guy.  He's obviously could lift some real weight.  That's one thing I never could figure out with him.  But we're doing curls with, like, not even 10 pounds.  I'm like, dice.  This does nothing. 
[01:31:30]  There's no way that does anything.  And we were in there for 15 minutes.  He goes, all right, that's good enough.  I'm like, we haven't even started yet.  And then we had to get the smoothie, which is a whole process.  It's like, smoothie.  Everything with him is crazy.  And everything at his house had to be, Jimmy knows this, over the top.  Everything has to be big.  Big.  He likes everything large.  Big shorts.  Big sweatshirts.  Just big bowls.  You can't even hold on to the, like, the fucking coffee cup.  It's because he likes to be five years old.  And when you're five years old, everything is big.  He eats with a giant spoon. 
[01:32:00]  It's like, you're not five.  And then he has every candy that has ever been invented.  It's like, you're right.  He's a giant child.  He's a giant child.  So that's a weird...  I do miss him, though.  I'm not, you know, but...  I love the guy.  I mean, I literally made my career.  I mean, and what career I have is what he started.  I've never laughed hard at just hanging out with him and just wandering around.  He makes the dumbest stuff just hilarious.  He walks into clothing stores and thinks it's Bangladesh that he can bargain with the fucking guy.  It's like, no, there's a price tag, and that's what you pay. 
[01:32:30]  It's America.  It's a famous sweatshirt story.  You know how he liked the hoodies and stuff.  So we were really getting along with him at NAW at our last, I don't know, probably five gigs ago at this point.  And he wants to take me and Ann shopping.  I'm like, that's fucking cool.  We're going to fucking shop with Dice.  And we go into the store at Antwerp talking about, and I wanted a nice hoodie, an Everlast black hoodie.  I'm like, yeah, I'd fucking wear that.  But he wouldn't let us buy our size, Nick.  No.  You've got to get the big ones.  So we bought...  Large size. 
[01:33:00]  Large.  Why?  I wish it was large.  It was, if I'm not mistaken, because I still have it, it was a double XL.  Giant.  Why on earth?  And we wore it in the store, and he's like, that looks good.  Wear them out.  Wear them outside.  You're like, what the fuck?  Do you know how annoyed I was I didn't get one?  It's like I was opening for him at the time, and he bought you two fucking groveling for  gig plugs.  And it's like, I'm your opener.  Could you fucking get me one?  I'm making a hundred bucks a show.  And it's a really nice hoodie, but it's so large, I've never worn it again.  And then he goes to the register.  And he's like, how much?  How much? 
[01:33:30]  And the guy's like, the price is there.  He goes, no, no, no.  I'll take three of them for $55.  And the guy's like, no, the price is fucking whatever it is.  Well, what do you give me?  It's like, no.  He's bartering with this guy like he's holding up two chickens.  And then he goes, does that ever work for him?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  It works everywhere.  It's amazing.  Like, he can go to fucking Macy's and be like, and bargain.  And he doesn't, he tells you, he goes, I'm going to throw these in for free. 
[01:34:00]  And he throws like really nice sneakers on the counter, and the guy doesn't know what  to do.  So next thing you know, he's getting free shit.  He does this.  This is a great one.  He's like, Jimmy has better stories.  No, just because I toured with him for three years, and he literally will say to the guy,  just throw it in the bag.  Who's looking?  And they know it's dice, so they want him to like them.  Just throw it in the bag.  Who's looking?  Who's looking?  Come on.  You throw it, put it right in your pocket.  He's just got this weird way.  He fucking got something for some electronic discount. 
[01:34:30]  He goes, come on, it's me.  And they're like, yeah, but we're really not supposed to.  He goes, dude, come on.  I think of you guys every time I drive by this place.  Who gives a fuck?  But it works.  It fucking works, man.  He's shameless.  It's very funny to watch.  That's amazing.  Very funny to watch, because I get uncomfortable.  I can't do it.  And he just doesn't give a shit.  That should be on his...  You should do that on the show.  Exactly.  You were supposed to be there.  Just go with it.  The premiere was supposed to be there.  Midtown yesterday.  There's Adam Sandler, and Nicole Washington's looking beautiful.  Look at it. 
[01:35:00]  She looks amazing.  I have to shut the fuck up.  She's an angel.  I'm sorry that I said that earlier.  I saw Kevin Nealon in the background.  Look how hot she is.  Fuck, man.  Sadness, not me in the background.  Yeah, you should have been there.  Oh, you'd have been all over this.  Yeah.  Oh, what happened?  You know all these people, though.  Sadness.  And now look, the movie.  They're doing the big commercial on TV.  I'm telling you, the movie's going to do well.  You don't even have to be here, Nick.  I'm just glad you stopped in, because we think you're a funny ass.  Oh, dude.  I would stop in any time.  Where are you at with pretend time?  Looks like we're coming back for season two.  Congratulations.  Oh, shit. 
[01:35:30]  Thanks, man.  I'm super excited.  Yeah, people either loved it or they fucking hated it.  But isn't that good?  Yeah, it was good, man.  I mean, I made the show I wanted.  It was filthy, and it was weird.  And people would, like, hit me on Facebook.  They'd be like, hey, your show fucking sucks.  I'm like, well, don't watch it.  We don't live in a fucking world where it's, like, it's mandatory.  Why are you telling me that?  To fucking watch something else.  There's 5,000 channels, you fucking retard.  Yeah, we were just talking about that.  Why do people have to go out of the way to tell you how much they hate you, but they say they're fans? 
[01:36:00]  I don't understand the mentality.  Yeah, I was like, hey, I love your stand-up.  Your show sucks.  Cool.  I don't know you fucking.  Don't watch my show.  Fucking asshole.  I hate a lot of stuff, but I've never reached out to those people, ever.  Yeah, but it's like, I see movies.  It's just so strange to me.  I like actors in.  I would never be like, hey, I'm a fan of your other shit.  This shit sucks.  Yeah, but that sucked.  Yeah, it's like.  Oh, thanks.  Yeah, like, all right.  I'm not into the backhanded compliment, thank you. 
[01:36:30]  I know, it's so bizarre.  But second season, pretend time, awesome.  Yeah, it's going to be filthy, too.  I'm really excited.  Are you?  Yeah, it was great.  So I remember halfway through season one, I remember we had a note where they were like,  all right, you guys, we've got enough sketches involving cocaine, dildos, and blood.  Those were the three things that we had maxed out in a lot of the sketches.  I haven't, I didn't see it.  I just, I don't watch.  I saw, like, part of the premiere, I didn't even know you had a show.  And then I just see it, and me and my girlfriend are watching, and you're getting hit in the 
[01:37:00]  face, but you and the chick are getting smashed with basketball.  I think it was, like, the first episode.  Oh, hockey pucks.  Hockey pucks, right, right, right.  And then I just wound up fucking her.  My girlfriend.  You got turned on by the blood.  No, we were just in the process of about to fuck you.  We actually stopped, and I was like, oh, fuck, they got the show.  And then I just, I should have, it's like one of those things.  I think that's a good review.  I'm not really sure.  I like it.  That's okay.  I'll take it.  It's so odd, like, when you just, you start to see your friends on television.  Like, I mean, for a long time I've been doing that, but it's just odd when you turn on,  and you're happy for your friend.  It's weird, yeah. 
[01:37:30]  And it makes you feel bad for yourself.  It's a very weird catchphrase.  You know what I mean?  It's like, if your friend gets divorced and is banging a 10, like, I'm so happy he's away from  that horrible situation.  God, I want to fuck that chick.  You know, it's that weird balance we have as comics, but Nick I genuinely like, like,  for a long time.  You know, it's always better when your friends are succeeding.  Yeah, we've known each other a long time.  I just want Nick to get big enough where he can start bringing me in movies without having  to explain.  Dude, you can do anything.  You should do something on the show.  You'd fucking love it.  It's so out there and fucked up.  You'd love it.  You can do anything. 
[01:38:00]  You can literally do anything you want on the show.  I'll give you my new number, and then just, yeah, just call me.  If you have any ideas, I'll be fucking doing anything.  How annoying would it be if I literally called, like, every 20 minutes with an awful idea?  You know what I mean?  Dude, look, I'm a child molester, right?  You get a bunch of kids.  It's just like, we can't.  Jim, we can't do that.  Things that are impossible.  Exactly.  All right, look, we do a thing with the Twin Towers.  It's like, no, we can't.  Jim, we can't do that.  No, no, no.  It's not going to fly at the network.  I snort human shit. 
[01:38:30]  What?  That's not even a sketch.  I know.  I'll just fucking do it, man.  Put me on the show.  You said anything.  If I wanted to be an extreme guy on the network?  I'm going to cut my own head off.  What?  That's not even possible.  That's funny.  So you have at least a certain amount of creative control over what you're...  Yeah, they've been great.  I've always heard, like, horror stories that they were hard to work with.  I mean, I've worked with them for a while, and they've never picked up anything I've ever  done.  This was the first show where they were kind of like, all right. 
[01:39:00]  And they were actually amazing.  They let me do kind of whatever I wanted, so they were actually great.  I can only say great things.  Okay, good, good, good.  But you had things that didn't go?  That's encouraging.  Yeah, I had pilots for years that they never did anything with.  Were there any that you should have went that didn't?  I did this live-action pilot called Gay Robot that I always thought was going to go.  And it never did.  I was really bummed out.  And that one I thought it was for sure going to go, and it didn't.  And it was a real, it was like almost kind of like an old 80s, kind of like Small Wonder 
[01:39:30]  type show, but it was a gay robot, and it was always, like, trying to get fisted and  stuff, and it didn't go.  And so, and maybe that's why, because it was, like, constantly trying to get fisted.  Why would a robot want to be fisted?  It's in its programming, I guess.  Fucking Small Wonder.  Jesus Christ, is that a horrible show.  I forgot about that fucking show.  But I watched it so many times.  It was so good, and it's like, you know, I just wanted to see that episode where it  just got dark, because you know it fucking did. 
[01:40:00]  Like the last episode where the dad just gets electrocuted by trying to eat her out or something,  where he just forgets that it's a robot, and just the tongue goes a little too far, and  it's just like...  On a Small Wonder, you won't forget.  Oh, the series finale of A Small Wonder.  That's great.  Technically, it's not pedophilia, because it's a robot.  No, it's a robot.  Yeah, it's not.  That's what we'll have to look forward to when robots are really prevalent, like how 
[01:40:30]  creepy it is when people want to build children robots and fuck them.  You'll have to let them do it.  And they're just walking around with the robot, like at the store, holding hands with  it all creepily.  Yeah, yeah.  People go, weren't you on the radio once?  And I'll say, yes?  That would be so creepy.  That would be creepy as shit.  But it would just, in essence, be a machine, but it would still be creepy.  Well, they say that pornographic images of children, if they're not real, are allowable.  There was a big case about that.  Oh, about putting their heads on bodies? 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, doing weird stuff like that.  I think the court said you have to allow, because it's not real.  Yeah, that's when I bought a Dolby Photoshop stock.  It's going to go through the roof.  People love it.  Or if they, like, I wonder if they did, like, an avatar.  If they just started, like, molesting avatars.  If they would get into trouble, because they're, I don't know, maybe it would be illegal.  We've got some questions to answer in the future.  In the future.  This is for future lawmakers.  When we're all wearing Mylar suits. 
[01:41:30]  Future Questions with Nick Swartzen.  You could do that for the show.  For ten times.  Yeah.  All right, we've got to take a break.  Just go with it.  This Friday in theaters.  Yeah, absolutely.  And I'm happy that you're doing well, Nick.  Thanks, dude.  Nick is great in the movie, man.  Wish I was doing better.  I'm happy you're doing very well.  You got any TV press going on?  I don't know.  Oh, yeah, I did Conan last night, and then I'm doing Fallon tonight.  Oh, yeah, Fallon's cool.  Yeah, he's great, man.  I love Jimmy.  He's a good guy.  Such a great dude.  That's how well Nick is doing, though, that he had to think, like, oh, yeah, Conan was last night, 
[01:42:00]  and Fallon is tonight.  That's great.  Where am I tonight?  No, I know.  It's been intense.  That's been good.  And I got to do Leno.  Are you doing Leno?  Yeah.  He loves robot fisting stories, by the way, so throw that one in.  He has a bunch of them.  You don't want to step on Jay's robot fisting stories.  I built them in my house with my cars.  Yeah.  Sometimes I fist my cars.  When are you doing it?  23rd of February.  I'm doing it Friday night. 
[01:42:30]  I'm doing a segment, but I'm so annoyed because Monday night Lady Gaga's on, and I really want  to do it with Lady Gaga.  Oh, look how close you're going to be to that.  Tell the Jay people that you want to stop by.  Yeah, do it.  What are you doing Friday?  What's your segment?  Do you know?  I think it's some question thing from the audience.  It's eating on robot babies?  Yes.  Can't you just stop by Monday to at least meet her?  I'm taping Chelsea Handler Monday, then leaving.  I probably could, but...  You should, man.  Dude, you should go by.  Chelsea's fun.  I love Chelsea's show.  She's great. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, the audience is amazing.  They're women, and they should hate me, but they're fucking, because of her crowd, they're  phenomenal.  They're fucking animals.  Nothing is too mean for them.  Yeah, because she's so awful.  She's so fearless.  Yeah, but that's great.  I think the best crowd in TV is that little fucking audience, because they don't mind it  mean.  Wow.  They really don't mind it harsh, and that's what you want.  Yeah, when I last did it, I wore a t-shirt that said, legalized crystal meth.  And that's like the only show I could ever wear that on.  That's like the one drug I don't think anyone is for legalizing. 
[01:43:30]  I made the shirts, I'll send you one.  That's fantastic.  Will you wear it if I send you one?  Oh, fuck yeah.  That's great.  Yeah, I made one.  I'm going to sell them on my website for fucking cheap.  That's hysterical.  It's like, everyone's like pot or even heroin.  Even coke, people are like, yeah, you know what?  Crystal meth, never.  There's no.  That's like no.  There's no way to get people behind that.  That's a hard one.  And Chelsea was all about it.  She's like, yeah, wear it.  I was like, that's so fucking cool.  There it is.  Since we're talking TV, I'll...  Oh, yeah, there it is. 
[01:44:00]  Nice.  I'll be doing a Sean Hannity on March 17th.  Oh, I'm doing it March 2nd.  Shut up.  Yeah.  Killjoy.  I bet I'll have a more interesting subject to talk about.  Yeah, I always like to know who I'm on with.  Do you find out who you're on with?  Obama.  Yeah.  I always check who I'm on with.  Do you?  Yeah, man.  I like to know.  I always want to know who I'm on with.  Whatever.  Dude, speaking of that, I did Conan and Jeff Bridges was the lead guest.  Jesus. 
[01:44:30]  And that's one guy where I wanted a picture and I just completely pussed out.  Why?  They never say no on the...  And it's totally acceptable because they know you're doing the show and you can just walk  over.  Right.  Hey, let's do a photo.  And they're always like, yeah, good.  They're always fucking cool.  I know.  I just didn't want to get like in the middle of the dude vibe.  You know what I mean?  It's fucking the dude from Lebowski.  I just didn't want to fuck that up.  Did you talk to him?  No, dude.  I had a full panic attack.  And I saw Tron in the theaters three times.  I was like obsessed with that new Tron movie.  So I wanted to like tell him that. 
[01:45:00]  Did you see it?  No, no, no.  I didn't know you did.  Wow.  Then you really were like wanting a picture.  I was freaking...  Yeah.  I was really fired up.  Yeah.  But I would have done something awful.  Did you have a good segment at least?  Yeah, it was fun.  Okay.  So at least you look good.  I was like, hey, man.  Can you show the motorcycle from Tron?  Can I ride it?  Oh, you were sitting out there with him.  No, no, no.  He didn't stay out.  I was nervous because I was like, is he going to fucking stay out there?  And they're like, we don't know.  And I'm like, oh, fuck.  Did you want him to?  I don't know. 
[01:45:30]  That would have made me really nervous.  After you say everything, you'd have to look over him for acceptance.  Hey, was that good, Tron?  I would have called him Tron.  It would have been really ugly.  Hey, Tron.  That's so bad.  Tron.  Will you let me in the grid?  Will you let me in the Tron world?  Can I blow your beard?  What?  Nothing.  Sorry, Tron.  Fucking Nick Swartzen. 
[01:46:00]  Funny motherfucker.  Just go with it in theaters this Friday.  Starring Nick Swartzen.  That's what I say.  Yes.  That's what I say today.  All right.  We should take a break.  All right.  I guess that's it.  Yeah.  Thank you, Nick.  Hey, thank you guys, man.  Always great to see you.  Absolutely.  Yes.  We'll see you next time.  Very cool.  Cheers, brother.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Obi and Anthony.  The Anthony Show.  Damn it.  Damn it.  Nick Swartzen's a funny guy, huh? 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, he's very funny.  Yeah.  He's a nice guy, too.  He's the same guy he was 15 years ago or 12 years ago, whatever.  He's not.  He's turned into a dick.  He's not.  You know, he's the same dude, man.  He doesn't do the show enough.  We've got to get him in here more.  A couple things.  Yeah.  We were talking about An Idiot Abroad.  Ricky Gervais' new show with Carl. 
[01:47:00]  And Steve Merchant, of course.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They put this together.  They've got Carl traveling the world, going to the seven wonders of the world, I guess.  And the Chinese episode was hilarious.  I'm all in with this show.  And we just got a quick taste of Carl describing Chinese people here.  It's very clever.  See, out of all the places, this is the place that I'm worried about the most.  Why?  Just the way they live.  They're different. 
[01:47:30]  What, Chinese people?  They just wreck everything.  They make everything weird.  That's what I'm worried about.  To you.  To you.  Everything.  Chicken.  Why is it orange in Chinatown?  Just the slightest thing.  The chicken is orange.  They eat anything.  You know what I mean?  Octopus.  Toad.  He just made that one up.  Say if I go over there, I have a bit of toad.  I go, do you know what?  It's quite nice, though.  It's nicer than chicken. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  It's going to be pretty tough to get a bit of grilled toad in this country.  It could make me sort of wish for stuff that I can no longer get hold of.  The way they write, the letters are weird.  Their alphabet's not like ours.  Their's like someone testing out a biro.  Everything's...  There's no logic to anything that they do.  There it is.  There isn't.  Of course there's a logic to it.  The way they read a book, it's all the other way around.  From back to front, instead of from front to back and up and down.  Everything that we've done, they've gone, right, we're going to do it weirder. 
[01:48:30]  That's how it comes across.  Well, some would say that they did it first.  Their civilization beat ours by many, many hundreds of years.  But anyway.  There you go, a little taste of Carl.  He's fucking hysterical, man.  I wonder if he'll do press.  He wasn't doing press for the show because Steve Merchant did for the show.  It's weird.  It's weird.  Chickens are orange.  Yeah.  You've got to check it out.  I think he'll like it.  Yeah.  We've got Jabral on the line.  Who's this Jabral?  Jabral, seems like a lot of the fans know Jabral. 
[01:49:00]  Well, he's chatting on a little chat room thingy here.  And he's apparently of some type of Middle Eastern descent.  Does he wear the uniform?  Yes.  The garb?  He wears the headgear, the weird little, like he's wearing his pajamas.  Okay.  And he's got hair like the Wolfman.  Okay.  And a giant I Hate America beard.  Okay.  And he trolls for chicks in this chat room. 
[01:49:30]  He trolls for girls all the time.  I don't think he leaves his house.  I think he's completely xenophobic and racist.  I guess we could talk to him, see what he's all about.  And he's a fan of the show?  Yeah, I guess.  I don't know much about this guy.  All right.  For the first time on our show, Jabral from Canada.  Jabral.  Yes, sir?  Are you a fan of our radio show?  Oh, man.  I like it so much.  It's my favorite show. 
[01:50:00]  I spent all night just listening to it.  Oh, that's very nice of you.  How did you find out about the show?  Oh, well, you know, I was just on Pal Talk and I saw something called Red, Opie, and Anthony  live show.  Ah, there you go.  All right.  Yeah.  Hey, so now I'm looking.  You...  You...  Yeah, I'm calling for my laundry room.  This is where I hang out, you know, in the middle of the night. 
[01:50:30]  Your laundry room.  Yes, sir.  Now, you're into girls, right?  Yeah.  You see, I have a problem.  I just...  I wanted your advice because, you know, you are an older person.  You know, you have experience.  Jesus.  Well, it was a nice way of saying it, anyway.  Well, you know, I live in Canada and, you know, the women here is so beautiful, you  know?  Oh, yes.  Of course.  I can't even go out of my house without, like, you know, I have to close my eyes.  It's very...  You get too, like, you get so wound up with looking at women?  Yeah.  And, you know, these women, they don't find me attractive. 
[01:51:00]  That's a problem.  So, I mean...  Well, don't you understand?  You're kind of...  You haven't really westernized yourself much.  You're really going with the look, that Middle Eastern look.  You got the big beard.  I think a lot of women would be frightened of you.  Maybe not rightly so, but you kind of look like, you know, you have that look like, oh,  that's an Al-Qaeda guy or something.  You look like you should be throwing rocks somewhere?  Yes.  You definitely look like you should have a bread helmet on.  That's not good if you're living in the West, sir. 
[01:51:30]  Jabril, how old are you?  Oh, I'm 22, sir.  22?  22 and you're looking like that?  And what do you do...  I'm a religious person, you know.  I know I'm being hypocritical, but, you know, I can't shave my beard and stuff like that.  Okay, but you like the beautiful women, kind of...  They get you all wound up.  I'm in a cast 22, you know.  Yeah, so you get all wound up.  Now, is this why a lot of Arab gentlemen like their women wrapped up so the temptation isn't there? 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, man.  I'm a man.  Like, you know, we have a...  You know, I mean, I'm sure you understand what we have.  We have a problem, you know, when we see such beautiful women, right?  Yeah, yeah.  And I have a big problem.  So you don't leave your house because of that?  Because you don't want to be tempted?  Well, I have to go to work, so I just quickly go to work and come back.  But I don't go anywhere else, you know.  What kind of job you got?  Making bomb belts.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  No, no, I'm a taxi dispatcher.  Oh, okay.  It has something to do with the transportation industry.  Yeah, yeah.  I know I just pick up the phone and tell people whether you want a taxi or send a taxi. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah?  Jesus.  You should work on Long Island.  So...  They all suck there.  So your religion doesn't allow you to have sex with girls, but you want to have sex with  girls.  So you don't leave your house because you don't want to be tempted.  So you just quickly go to your job and you come home.  Is that correct?  No, you see, the thing is I'm very poor.  You know, I can't afford to get married.  You know, everyone who's in my religion, they just get married.  But I have a problem because I have a $10 hour job.  You know, it's a minimum wage.  And what?  You need a certain amount of money to get married?  Yeah. 
[01:53:00]  And I can't...  And people said that you should go to university.  But when I go to university, I can't concentrate on my study because there's all the girls that  are there.  Wow.  This guy is so wound up.  He's just a guy in his early 20s that's fucking freaking out for chicks.  And his religion is keeping him from banging.  And the religion allows you to have sex if you're married, I guess.  Right?  It's one of those...  Yeah.  I mean, how are we going to have kids, man?  So we have to get married.  Yeah, but see, the Catholic religion is like that, but we blow off that little thing.  Yeah.  We have the sex before the marriage.  You can't do that because of religion? 
[01:53:30]  I'm going to guess.  Are you a Muslim?  Yes, sir.  See?  I just pulled that out of my ass.  I just figured.  I'm pretty sharp with that.  I hear you don't like the Chinese.  No, that's right.  I think they are very boring people.  Boring?  Yeah, very boring.  What?  Well, the Chinese taking a beating today from all angles.  Their women is not very beautiful, actually.  Their women is not very beautiful.  I'm not a fan.  I don't hate Asian women, but I'm not a huge fan.  I'm not a fan.  It's an acquired sex group for some people. 
[01:54:00]  It's not my thing, sexually.  Even massage parlors, I just have maybe five times in my life, six times in my life.  What about some of the girls that work our supermarket, Jimmy?  There's a few lookers.  Never seen one that I would...  It's an Asian supermarket.  No.  So now all the Asians work there.  I've never seen an Asian girl that...  I mean, I've seen some, but in daily life, I'm such a perv.  Black girls, Spanish girls, but it's mostly white and Spanish girls.  You mix that Asian with just a little something else, though, and wow, what comes out.  It really does improve everything.  Yeah, a little one part Asian to ten parts white. 
[01:54:30]  Wow.  And that'll do you.  Black and Asian makes very attractive.  They make supermodels.  Supermodels, yeah, they really do.  Basically.  Great combination.  Yeah, now I hear also people are telling me here that you don't really enjoy the company  of black women.  No, sir.  They're quite a different attitude, you know.  They're too loud mouth for me, you know.  Too loud?  I want a woman who is very subservient and going to be very nice and quiet.  You want a woman that you can beat with a stick that won't turn around and say anything 
[01:55:00]  about it.  Or just go to the movies with it and she won't talk through the whole thing.  One or the other.  I want a woman who is going to be disciplined and going to be very, you know, not very making  me problems for me.  Yeah, you don't want the problems.  What kind of problems do women usually give that you don't want to deal with and as a  Muslim gentleman you wouldn't have to deal with?  Oh, you know, the snagging, you know, take out the garbage, you know, make your bed and  this and that.  You know, it's like I don't want another mom.  You know, I already have one mom.  Right.  So she would do all the housework without asking any questions. 
[01:55:30]  You go home.  I do the work.  You do the work.  You bring the money home.  Exactly.  And would you allow her to wear Western clothing?  Oh, no, sir.  Never.  So she would have to wear a burqa?  Yes, definitely.  But let me ask you, in the bedroom, like, maybe Muslim guys have a bad reputation.  Like, would you want her to wear, like, sexy lingerie and undergarments and, like, crotchless  panties and things for you?  Oh, Jimmy.  Seriously?  Oh, yes, definitely.  Oh, you would?  Yeah.  Okay, so that's allowed in the privacy of your own bedroom? 
[01:56:00]  Yes, yes, sir.  Oh, okay.  All right.  But then once she's out and about, cover up.  Yeah, because, you know, I don't want somebody to steal my wife, you know?  Well, that's, yeah, that happens.  If I could get a wife in the bedroom, I don't want to work.  That's why I burqa up my women these days.  That's a good question.  Is that a, is the way they make women dress up, like, and cover, is that because the men  are weak and can't not fuck, or is it because they don't trust the women and they  don't want the men hitting on them?  Well, you know, our religion says women is a big temptation.  You know, you know Adam and Eve, right? 
[01:56:30]  You know, so.  I don't really believe that, though.  Yeah.  I don't believe that she ate an apple out of a tree and he took a rib.  It's just silly.  It was a pomegranate.  Yeah.  But, you know, you have to be careful with women.  They are very dangerous.  You know, they're very beautiful.  But Adam and Eve really is just a made-up story.  They didn't hang out in an apple tree and a snake said, hey, have an apple.  This guy's got the big beard in that.  I know that, but he's a smart guy.  He's believing it.  He's not.  Deep down, you know Adam and Eve are just kind of a silly story.  He knows that.  No, no, sir.  It's a true story.  It's not a true story. 
[01:57:00]  It's a true story.  It's a true story.  You know, it's a true story.  It's our legends for a long time.  We can't just dismiss them.  We can.  Do you live in an area in Canada where there are a lot of Muslims?  No, sir.  I'm like the only one who's practicing my religion in the city.  Really?  Where do you find a mosque?  We have a mosque, but it's very far.  I have to take the highway.  But I don't have a car, so I just pray at home.  Oh, gee.  Do you think that the Earth is flat or round?  Well, I don't know.  It's quite confusing because the Earth seems to be flat, you know, but people are saying 
[01:57:30]  it's round.  But I've never really seen any evidence of that.  Oh, okay.  I'm kind of just going to hold off on.  Yeah?  What about, like, space pictures from outer space?  Well, they could be fake, you know?  They have Photoshop these days, so they can just, like, make pictures.  Yeah, but they took pictures before Photoshop of the planet, and it's round.  Yeah, why would they do that?  It's a sphere.  I mean, you know about people say that people went to the moon, but, you know, they discovered  that that was just a studio.  Right, right. 
[01:58:00]  That was all fake.  Yeah.  Totally fake.  I mean, who could go to the moon?  I mean, we can't even go to the moon now.  How we can go in 1969.  Exactly.  As a religious guy, let me ask you, because it's easy to judge religious people and get  annoyed, but there's a reason that, like, a lot of times smart people hang on to religion.  Like, are you, is there a part of you that's afraid of it not being true?  No, sir.  I have 100% certainty in my faith.  No, no, no, no.  What I mean, not that your faith is in doubt, but is there a part of you that is scared, 
[01:58:30]  like, what life would be like if it wasn't true?  Like, I'm wondering what keeps people attached to religion when, deep down, I know they know  better.  Well, definitely, sir.  You know, see, like, I'm not a very good-looking person and all that, and if there was no heaven,  you know, then my life would be very depressing, you know?  At least I can look forward to having some very beautiful women in the heaven.  In the heavens.  Okay.  So, I mean, why I want to be an atheist when I would just kill myself then, you know?  Like, there's nothing to live for.  All right, so you just explained why, that's a good explanation as to why you kind of hang 
[01:59:00]  on to religion, and I think a lot of people do to get into the afterlife because it's supposed  to be a better place, and it kind of makes this life more bearable, knowing that there's  something better or believing it.  Okay, that makes sense.  Okay, sir.  So, actually, wouldn't you just shave and cut your hair a little bit and try to fit more  into society if you had no faith in the religion instead of just, you know, killing yourself 
[01:59:30]  because there's nothing to live for?  Then you could really live it up.  That's true, but, you know, sir, it's very hard to get women still, you know?  All my friends are complaining, you know?  Do you find you encounter a lot of racism because of your appearance when you go out?  Well, I get scared a lot, but I think people, they're just scared of me, so they don't say  anything.  They're scared of you?  I keep a knife with me because, you know, I'm scared somebody might want to attack me,  so I just keep it concealed in my bag, you know, just in case, you know? 
[02:00:00]  Just in case some, you know?  You know, the problem in Canada is we don't have a Second Amendment.  You know, I wanted to register a gun, but, you know, they're like, no, there's too much  red tape.  You can't get a gun here.  Yeah.  I'd be a little scared to give you a gun, to tell you the truth.  Well, sir, I need to defend myself, you know?  Wow.  People might want to kill me or something, you know?  I have to defend my property.  Yeah.  My life is quite in a very vulnerable place as well.  What's that thing called that you put on your head that looks like Yasa Arafat's hat?  Oh, it's called a scarf.  Oh, it's just a scarf.  Okay.  Maybe you could get that made out of Kevlar to help you out, just in case somebody tries 
[02:00:30]  to take a pot shot at you.  You got a hell of a head of hair.  Can I see a picture of him?  Yeah, look at this guy.  What's he look like?  I want to see what you look like, sir.  Let me punch up this.  Look at that.  It's like the wolf man.  You really are.  You look like Taliban, like that's, I'm not making fun of you.  No, no, you see, we have to have long hair in our religion because that's how our prophet  had long hair. 
[02:01:00]  That's why, I mean, I don't follow this black style rap artist, you know, they shave their  head.  That looks very stupid to us.  Oh, that kind of Muslim look.  We got a religious, you know, we have to keep long hair and long beard.  We have to look like a prophet in our religion.  But do you think, let me ask you honestly, because like Christ is, I guess Christ was  considered some sort of a prophet.  I don't know what his role in Islam is, but he had long hair and a beard and Christians  don't.  Chris?  No, Jesus Christ.  Oh, okay, yeah.  Like, because he had long hair and a beard, supposedly, in the Bible.  And how come that people don't try to look like him? 
[02:01:30]  Well, I don't really know about him that much, but, you know, I heard, like, you know, like  he was a, I mean, I heard he was not a very good person, but we're supposed to believe  in him, but, you know, what I've heard about him.  Good guy?  Sounded like a good guy?  People think Jabral's full of shit.  No, no, he's not.  He's the real deal.  He's a young Muslim that's really torn between his religion and getting some fucking pussy.  Yeah, it's really, uh...  Hey, Jabral, do you, uh, do you whack it?  Whack what? 
[02:02:00]  Do you masturbate?  It's okay, man.  No, sir, it's against my religion.  It's against the religion.  How do you get the poison out?  Well, you know, you have to, uh, sometime I get wet dream, you know, like yesterday I  had a wet dream about this woman called Devil's Tale.  Ah!  Who's Devil's Tale?  She's very beautiful, man.  She's very beautiful.  I want to marry her, but she's like, um, she's already married, so...  Let's see.  You didn't look like an ugly guy, though, in the picture.  You just look like an average guy.  Right?  What are the young Muslims supposed to do?  Yeah, it's very hard, brother.  This is some, uh, torment. 
[02:02:30]  Can I, can I tell you, it just seems like...  She looks a little dark for you, though.  Let me see.  Oh, because I'm, you know, my light is not that good, so...  I actually have very fair skin, but you know how it is.  It really seems like Islam sets it up, and don't take this offensively, but they put  young Muslim guys in a really, like, if you're religious, there's not a lot of fun  stuff on Earth.  Like, prayer and religion are, I guess, if you like that, you like that, but it's not  fun.  And when you're in... 
[02:03:00]  This is one reason they hate Western civilization.  It isn't that they're jealous of everything we have, but they do know.  I think that a lot of times, very religious people know that if you put guys, even, you  know, religious young Muslim men in Western situations, it's hard not to want to go out  and bang chicks, or to drive a nice car, or just to eat Burger King.  You know, the problem is, I was born in this country.  This is the biggest mistake my grandfather made, was to leave his country to come here.  And for that, I really, really don't like him, but you know, he's dead, I can't see  him.  But it wasn't a mistake, though.  What country?  From Pakistan, that's where we were from. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, Pakistan.  Okay.  So you would have liked to be in Pakistan.  You wouldn't know what he's missing if he was in Pakistan.  Oh, Babu!  Babu!  You don't want to be in Pakistan, man.  You have more fun here.  This place just makes you feel ugly and bad about yourself, because you feel different,  and you feel like you can't get girl.  I mean, I know you said that, but that's the only thing that makes you feel bad about not  being in Pakistan.  Is there, at least you figure you'd probably look better to women, and have an easier 
[02:04:00]  time getting women.  Yeah, it would be, because it's all about women, man, because that's from young men,  you know how I am.  Sure.  Jesus is a very bad man.  Very bad man.  But I think that you're, I think you should just try enjoying yourself a little bit, and  like, I'm not saying walk away from religion, but whether you realize it or not, there is  a part of you that is really annoyed that you have to adhere to that religion.  It's too strict.  Yeah, strict, but you know, I guess when I'm older, I'll probably appreciate it. 
[02:04:30]  Because let me ask you a question, an honest question, like, because you say there's going  to be a lot of women in heaven, but does it really make sense that God is so strict with  people on earth, and then when you get to heaven, he's like, all right, shave, fuck  these chicks.  It doesn't make sense.  Well, you see, God wants to know whether we are deserving of his reward, you know.  Ah, the reward.  Okay.  The big reward after your faith and serving.  The reward is for, like, people who deserve it, you know.  Yeah, but...  So this is just a testing ground. 
[02:05:00]  Hey, can I, I gotta jump in.  Uh, that's, that's some crazy faith.  Yeah, you got rewards all around you right now.  Yeah, you're...  Why wait for the rewards when you can have them right the fuck now?  Sorry?  Yeah, there's a lot of, oh, he's right, there's a lot of rewards all around you right now.  Why wait?  You could get your own virgins.  You don't have to wait for the virgins, uh, in heaven.  That's the evil test, though, to see if you're gonna...  Oh, man, this is fucked up.  And this is our limited time.  He's talking eternity of rewards.  If you could just hold out for 75, 80 years, uh, uh, here on Earth, then you'll have an 
[02:05:30]  eternity of good times.  Where does God pile up, uh, the, the, the people that blew the eternity test?  Uh, you go...  Where are they piling up?  In Jew heaven.  You go to hell.  Yeah, how do you feel, how do you feel about the Jews?  But wouldn't hell just be hell after a while?  That old gag, kind of like how we talk about prison after a while, it just becomes your  life.  It just becomes your life.  After a while, you're sick of screaming, and you go, you know what, I'm done screaming.  Do you think at one point you just stop screaming and go, I'm exhausted?  I'm exhausted from screaming, and I have no voice left. 
[02:06:00]  But meanwhile, the pain is you on fire.  But that goes away after a while.  And then you're just like, ah, the sting kind of goes away after a while.  It's not that bad.  Yeah, I don't know.  After a few billion years.  I don't know, a billion, yeah.  So, uh, what do you think about the Jews, my friend?  Oh, I, I just don't like them, you know.  They're a bunch of loan sharks, man.  Have they, have they done anything personally to you?  Yes, sir.  You know, um, I'll tell you one story.  Uh-huh.  I wanted to, uh, buy a car, right?  Because, uh, I take the bus, and I was getting really annoyed about the women. 
[02:06:30]  You know, there's so many women in the bus.  You know, you can't.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Think of how many you can blow up.  So, I went to the bank, and, you know, they're all owned by Jews, you know.  So, I was like, okay, like $5,000.  They're like, yeah, we give you $5,000, but, you know, you're going to have to pay, like,  like, I don't know, 20% interest rate if you don't pay it at this time.  And I didn't have a job at that time, and these Jews kind of, like, messed up my life,  you know.  But, because they wouldn't give you a loan because you didn't have a job, and you didn't  want to pay interest?  You might want to look at their point of view on this one. 
[02:07:00]  Now, I'm not saying the Jews can't be chislers, but sometimes you have to give it to them.  But, you know, they're a bunch of loan sharks, man.  20%, that's, like, that's whales.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  Wow.  You know, I just don't like them, you know.  So, you don't like the Chinese, the black girls, and the Jews.  Can you list them in order of hate?  There you go.  Right.  Yeah.  Well, I really don't like black, actually.  So, I put them on number one.  Not amp, but amp, really.  No one starts with number one.  That wasn't me. 
[02:07:30]  No one starts with number one.  You've got to start from the bottom.  Well, he just gave you the big number one.  The bottom would be the Chinese, then the Jews, then the black, you know.  Wow.  How about gay people?  How do you feel about us, them, them?  Oh, you know, I really don't like gay people, either.  Yeah?  They really scare me, you know.  You know, they have a joke that there's a part in Pakistan where a lot of gay people live, right?  Uh-huh.  And they say the birds, when they fly over that place, they keep one wing behind their back, you know.  That's how, like, that's...  Really? 
[02:08:00]  Because they say that the guys will fuck them in the ass?  Fuck the birds in the ass?  How do they fly with one wing?  Yeah.  I was trying to say even the birds are gay over there, like it's really a joke.  Yeah, I guess it's lost in the translation somewhere, but...  Yeah, I think they're preventing their heinies from being fucked with shit and piss tumbling out.  Even a gay guy wouldn't fuck a bird asshole.  Because everything falls out of there.  Shit, piss, nervous fly, quickly go.  Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go.  Birds, boys, in a hurry.  Flap, flap, flap, shit, piss, shit, piss.  Gotta go, peck, peck, worm.  Yeah, we got it.  I'm a huge fan of your bird viewer. 
[02:08:30]  I hate birds.  Every single time.  Jabral, one other thing about the virgins, all right?  Do you Muslims understand that they're not great leis?  Virgins suck, dude.  Virgins suck.  It's kind of a nice...  Yeah, slow down.  Yeah, I wouldn't know I'm a virgin.  It's kind of a nice conquest, but in the end, it's an awful lay.  Yeah, dude, they're the worst.  If that's what you're waiting for in heaven, you might be a little disappointed, especially after the first one.  The first one might be, wow, okay, that was cool. 
[02:09:00]  But then you gotta fuck how many more after that?  71?  How many did they get in?  I don't know.  You got like 70-something.  72?  Yeah.  72, yes, sir.  You're not going to be happy with that.  72 virgins.  You want some experience there, Jabral.  Well, what I think I'll do is I'll just take a break once in a while.  Because there's other things in heaven, too.  There's nice food.  There's nice scenery.  And then when I get...  Scenery.  Do people really believe this stuff?  Yeah.  Yes.  What do you mean scenery?  What's scenery?  Oh, you know, there's all those trees and... 
[02:09:30]  I picture a lot of open fields, prairies.  You have that in Canada, too.  Meadows.  You have that now.  You have all that now.  But in Canada, it snows.  You know, it's very cold.  I can't go outside.  So it doesn't snow in heaven?  No.  Sorry, my dryer is finished.  I have to hang it up.  What?  Oh, his dryer is finished.  Well, can't you let your clothes just hang out there for a second?  No, you gotta get them right away.  Why?  It's a religious thing.  Yeah, they're nice and hot, and so I like to hang them and iron them, you know, stuff  like that.  Oh, don't be so OCD.  God will understand.  You don't have to iron your kook.  No, he's gotta iron them. 
[02:10:00]  Don't be a kook.  My God.  He's gotta take care of his laundry now.  Yeah, you can wait a few minutes.  All right, my...  It's an international phone call.  Pakistani friends.  Tumble-dry them on regular air.  That'll make them even fluffier for your obsessive ironing.  All right, Jabral.  All right.  I guess we're trying to get to know each other, finally.  Yes, we are.  Yeah, you know...  Man, I don't understand at all.  Project Outreach.  He's a Muslim friend.  Let's talk to a Chinese next.  Yes.  That's how we...  That's how we do it.  Take care.  There he goes.  Bye, Jabral.  Yeah, he's gone. 
[02:10:30]  He's gone.  And there he...  Yeah, he goes.  He's going into his washroom.  Yeah.  And he's gonna...  He's gonna, what they say, iron is close.  Maybe that's the problem he's having with women.  Like, they would fuck him, but every time he gets close, he has to run in and do laundry.  Dude, if you hate...  You don't like the Chinese, but you could always ask one of them to do that for you.  There's a way around this.  I want to get this guy a hooker.  Oh, my God.  He would never.  He would probably have to...  He would never.  He would probably have to kill himself if he actually went through it.  Yeah, he would...  If he went through it, then the torment... 
[02:11:00]  The guilt and torment would really, really get him.  Hey, we should take a break, because I think Les is gonna be here any moment.  Les Stroud.  He's promoting a book, right, Jimmy?  Yes.  I just saw him on the TV.  It's called Will to Live Dispatches from the Edge of Survival, and it smells good.  I'll be somebody smelling the book.  Oh.  It smells good.  I rubbed my dick on it before.  We just got it.  Why didn't they give it to us early so we could look at it and then interview him about the book?  Yeah, we always get the book too late.  Survivor Man is next, all right?  And as we go to break, Oscar's right around the corner, so we do this for the people. 
[02:11:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show proudly presents Oscar Moments.  Memorable scenes from Academy Award-nominated films.  And now, here's Oscar.  Nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Cinematography, Original Score, and Best Picture,  Inception, presented by Daniel Bobo Curlin and George Dudley.  They say we only use a fraction of our brain potential. 
[02:12:00]  Now, that's when we're awake.  When we're asleep, our mind can do almost anything.  Uh, such as?  Well, imagine you're designing a building, all right.  You consciously create each aspect, but sometimes it feels like it's almost creating itself.  If you know what I mean.  Yeah, like discovering it.  Genuine inspiration, right?  Now, when a dream continuously does this, we create a precise, perceive our world simultaneously, 
[02:12:30]  and our mind does this so well that we don't even know it's happening.  It also allows us to get right in the middle of that process.  How?  You fucking retardo.  By taking over the creating part.  Now, listen.  This is where I need you.  You create the world of the dream.  We bring the subject into that dream, and they fill it with their subconsciousness.  How can I ever acquire enough detail to make them think it's reality? 
[02:13:00]  I can't.  Well, dreams, they feel real.  Well, we're in them, right?  It's only when we wake up and then we realize that there's something that was actually strange.  Let me ask you a question.  You never really remember the beginning of a dream, do you?  You always wind up right in the middle of what's going on.  I guess, yeah.  So how did we end up here?  Well, we just came from the, uh...  Think about it.  How did we get here? 
[02:13:30]  Where are you right now?  We're dreaming?  Fuck me.  Stay tuned for more Oscar moments.  Presented by the Opie and Anthony Show.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony on the virus.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.

[02:15:00]  Roland's in studio.  And that means you got lesses outside, less Stroud.  It's less Stroud and more Roland.  See, because there's a lot of Roland.  Oh, he hissed at me again.  He does hiss like a cat.  Yes, he does.  He's cute.  He's adorable.  He's like a little kitty.  Hey, Les, welcome back to the show, brother.  How you doing?  How are you, man?  Yeah, just saw you on the TV.  Good, what's going on?  I just saw you on the TV.  You were doing an interview. 
[02:15:30]  Doing a lot of press, are you?  Just a bit.  Not all that much.  Yeah, a little bit, huh?  Yeah, yeah, just a bit for the book and that.  That's cool.  Will to live.  Les Stroud, creator of Survivorman.  Dispatches from the edge of survival.  This sounds serious.  Yeah, you need an echo on your voice.  Yeah, right?  This does sound really serious.  And it's got a picture of you on some homemade raft going down a river.  Why can't you just call a boat?  Just call a boat up and go, could you help me out? 
[02:16:00]  I've got to get down this river.  I went to the middle.  This is what I do with every book.  If it has a lot of pictures, I'm in.  Les, I am in.  A lot of photos in the middle of the book.  What is this?  This is a creepy shot.  This is a dangerous stuff.  What are you eating?  That's the witchetty grub in Australia.  That was actually, you know what that tasted?  It tasted like a little piece of pork rind filled with peanut Thai paste.  Oh, okay.  That doesn't sound bad.  It looks disgusting, but it tastes awesome.  What is it called?  Witchetty grub.  Witchetty grub in Australia, yeah.  Yeah.  What are they the larvae of? 
[02:16:30]  I don't know.  Something big and ugly.  All right.  Les, what about that picture?  You're in the snow with a snorkel?  What?  Yeah, and buried under the, yeah, I was buried under an avalanche for Surviving Alaska one  time with Discovery Channel that we did, and that was, I got claustrophobic.  I started swearing at the cameraman at one point because he wasn't ready, and I was buried  in the snow, and I was getting claustrophobic, and they had to pass me down a little tank  of oxygen, and I was like, get your shot!  And I was just like, wow, yeah.  I was freaking.  Wow, how deep?  Not that deep, only under a few feet, but, you know, a few feet, I mean, it's claustrophobia, 
[02:17:00]  right?  What the fuck?  Oh, and you got pictures of one of my favorite episodes, was the little light plane crash  episode there?  Oh, yeah, that was cool.  That was a good one.  That was probably one of the most fun ones I ever did, because that was almost, I got  to say, like being in my backyard, because that wasn't too far, well, an area where I  have a cottage and stuff, but it's way, I was way out in the bush, but I know that area  really well, and it felt good being out there.  It was cool, too, because it involved so many things.  It was surviving the elements, using your resources to make some shelter, and then improvise, a 
[02:17:30]  lot of improvising, using wires to make snares, and you snared a rabbit?  Yeah, which was totally a fluke, and lucky to get that quick.  It was really, I was like, there's no way, come on, he's going to snare that.  I know, that was with 12 hours, the fastest I'd ever caught a rabbit.  That's something.  That plane, I got from a plane wreckers, and we took it in, we put it in position so I  can work with it and all that, and I look, and there was blood on the seat.  Oh, shit.  And I asked the guy later, I said, so what's the story behind it? 
[02:18:00]  He says, yeah, that was a double fatality.  Wow.  Thanks for telling me before I get out there.  Yeah, it was kind of creepy.  Yeah, it was totally creepy.  How are the hotels around the world?  They're awesome.  That's right.  That's not you.  Wrong guy.  That's the other guy.  I just wanted to talk to you.  What do you take in the wild with you when you go?  They'll put you in there to see how you can survive.  Do you bring water or any of that stuff or nothing?  When it was Survivorman, each sort of thing was a little bit slightly different. 
[02:18:30]  Some raw seal meat in the Arctic, a little bit of water in the desert.  It depended on what I was doing.  Because I always try to make the survival story fit to what's going on.  And when I say stories, because I'm there to really sort of go through this survival  odyssey and then tell the story.  It's like, okay, well, what fits here?  So I had like a Land Rover in the desert or a dog team in the Labrador, that sort of thing.  Do you get stung by bees a lot?  I hate bees.  That's the one thing that freaks me.  It's like in the jungle, the worst thing.  One of the stories in the book is about Yossi Ginsberg, and he had everything happen to him. 
[02:19:00]  He was like 19 days in the jungle, in the Amazon jungle.  And at one point, on one day alone, he slides down a mud embankment and impales his anus.  Oh, man.  And about two hours later, he's like crawling through the bush, and he stumbles on a hornet's  nest.  And in the Amazon jungle, hornets, which are like, they're like, they make like, they put  his hand in the nest.  It's a pushy compared to the Amazon jungle.  Wow.  Yeah.  And it's just like everything went wrong.  But hornets are the one thing that always kind of like, I'm always like, okay, everything's  going on, everything's going on. 
[02:19:30]  But if I run into a hornet's nest, I'm done.  Bees in the jungle.  I feel like I think of another letter I wouldn't like to see in the jungle.  Anyway.  But wait, when you stumble on hornets, are there nests in the air, or do you kick them by mistake?  You go, oh.  Nests in the air, kick them by mistake.  Have you seen them?  Oh, yeah.  All the time.  Yeah.  That's not fun.  Oh, wait a minute.  Who's the Ozzy Osbourne fan?  I am.  Oh, yeah.  You know what I just did up, I was asked to, I played harp on The Wizard on a Tony Iommi  tribute album up north.  They're putting together, all the original members of Black Sabbath, or different members 
[02:20:00]  were playing on the album, and I went and blew the harp for The Wizard.  And it's, I met Tony Iommi years ago when I was producing much music up in Canada.  Did you play with Tony on that?  No, no.  It's a tribute album for him.  Okay, that's great.  Yeah, so it was awesome.  Yeah, so I know it's a total tangent on the book.  No, that's cool, man.  Yeah, I knew somebody that was an Ozzy fan.  Yeah, no, Jimmy's the biggest Ozzy fan.  I do love him.  There's no one bigger.  Well, I told, you know what I did was, they said, well, just come, and of course, I listened  to Ozzy's plan, and Ozzy's harp plan is not the best harp plan, but, so I went in 
[02:20:30]  and I had to do this thing, and so I said, well, can I just, like, give it?  And he said, yeah, give it.  So I actually went sort of Jimi Hendrix harp on the beginning of the whole thing.  Harp?  Do you know harmonica?  Harmonica.  Oh, okay, I'm thinking, you know, I know, but when he said harp, I'm thinking heaven  music, I'm like, that doesn't make, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.  Harp, sorry, slang for harmonica.  Oh, okay.  Blue slang for harmonica.  I mean, you got a harp with you, buddy.  Yeah.  It's like that kind of, so, no, yeah, it was very, it was totally awesome, so I just freaked  it out, and the guys loved it.  That's great.  So we got this whole sort of me on harmonica, Jimi Hendrix sort of intro to the wizard, and  then they go into classic wizard. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, right on.  I would love to play fucking on an I, on me, just the tambourine, anything that a non-musical  man could play.  I mean, I'll tap my feet like Larry Craig.  Les, what was the, thank you.  What was the worst thing you ate in the wild?  That question, I understand.  Worst thing, you know what, the last, the last show of Beyond Survival, which was the, you  know, the series Beyond Survival, that was the series, the latest series I've got, that  they're running.  It's, I went in and I ate a Sago grub, which looked like the witchetty grub in that book,  uh, and, but it was like feet away from a wild pig that they trapped in, pig mud everywhere. 
[02:21:30]  It was really disgusting, and this thing was undulating, and kids are hanging it from  their mouth, and I, so I go and I eat it, and it was really disgusting.  Wow, that is nasty.  What does it taste like?  Uh, I don't know, puke or something.  It was just, it was just like, can I, can I, can I keep that, you know what it was?  Can you keep it down, though?  Well, I actually said in the shot, I said, you know that moment when you're out for dinner,  and you're having a wicked steak, and you put in a piece of grizzle you didn't mean to eat,  and you're sitting there, and you're like, you're starting to sweat, and you're looking  for a piece of bread, and it's like, oh my god, I can't swallow this, but I'm, I can't 
[02:22:00]  like, spit it out, and it's like, and it was like one of those moments, it was like,  oh god, how am I going to get this down?  Yeah, because they expect you to keep it down.  Yeah, well, they don't expect you to throw it out.  They don't want to insult them.  A bunch of shamans in the middle of the jungle have finished tattooing me with a rusty nail,  and they're like, yeah, but I'm going to spit out your food.  If you're, if you're starving to death, uh, would you, like, that looks hideous,  but if you're starving, your body would keep that in, like, right?  Like, like, your body has to know, though.  Yeah, you get over plate fright pretty quick.  That's all, it's all about plate fright, right?  Plate fright, yeah.  So that's why people eat just about anything.  You go, you know, most people go seven hours without food, and they'll eat just about anything. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  You go three days, you know, scorpions look good.  Wow.  Especially if someone says, this is good for you, you can eat it, and especially if they  eat it first in front of you, then it's like, all right, how do you eat a scorpion?  Just take the tail off again.  You just nip the, you gotta, you gotta carefully nip the tail off, and, and then you can eat.  And so, you know, it's like eating a little shrimp.  Same family, right?  Do you kill it while it's dead?  I mean, do you kill it or eat it alive?  Do you kill it while it's dead?  Well, I know.  On the original Survivor, man, and I, I ate it for a lot, that was pretty much just showmanship,  eating it alive.  But you cook it on a, on a, on a, you know, on a barbie, and then you get like this, like 
[02:23:00]  on a shish kebab, and then you get a nice little crispy.  It's like eating little chicken wing ends or something.  Yeah, it tastes awesome.  Not bad?  Not bad at all.  It tastes like little shrimps.  Wow.  The chuggy's like weird.  Yeah.  Well, see, that's the thing is, is, you know, sometimes you'll see on different survival shows,  everything looks so gross.  Oh, this is really gross.  You know what?  No, it's not.  You just make it look gross.  It actually tastes good.  We were talking about it earlier.  A Need to Eat Abroad is a new show, and the guy went to China, and he was watching a guy  eat a fetus, like the eggs. 
[02:23:30]  Chicken, yeah.  Chicken eggs are fertilized, and they're growing in there, and then they eat it like that.  Yeah, they let them develop a little bit, and then it's a delicacy, and they showed  the guy taking the shell off, and it was developing fucking chicken.  Well, yeah, it's, like, up in northern Quebec, they eat this stuff where they take, they  used to take the stomach of a caribou, they put all of the organs of the caribou into  the stomach, hang it from a tree for about two weeks in the summer, and then come back,  and that's a delicacy.  So, what people eat around the world is amazing, man.  Wait, the stomach of a caribou hung in a bag? 
[02:24:00]  No, it is the bag, right?  Yeah, that is the bag.  And they put all the organs inside it, and they let it rot for two weeks.  We got a caribou stomach back there?  And then they eat it.  Well, I just started.  I just gagged.  It's like haggis.  I just gagged a little bit.  Are there flies on it when they come to it?  There's everything on it.  Yeah.  Would you try it?  Wow.  It's disgusting.  But you could eat just, we could eat way, you know, lots of things, we could eat way  more than what we think we can, you know.  It's safe or not, yeah.  We could eat a lot more.  People think, oh, you touch anything raw.  Do they get food poisoning, you think?  No, no.  No.  But you know what?  It's not going from truck to shelf to shelf to wrapper to shelf to your plate. 
[02:24:30]  But there's probably bugs on it, though.  How do you eat it with bugs on it with flies?  Yeah, eat the bugs.  Bugs don't, uh...  Eat the bugs.  What the fuck?  The rest of the world is awful.  It is.  I hate the planets.  What the shit?  Get a fucking burger.  What are you doing?  Who looks at that and goes, let's hang the fucking stomach for two weeks?  Hey, wait a minute.  Didn't Ozzy eat a dove?  He did, yes.  But that was for the record contract.  That was just being ironic.  I've got to ask you something about the production of the show. 
[02:25:00]  Now, you're alone when you do this.  Those long shots you do, now you've got to set the camera up on a tripod and then kind  of walk across at a distance and then go back, get the camera, because it's a very majestic  look, but it seems like something that you wouldn't do to just like, hey, here, I have  a handheld camera.  It is just for pure production value.  Well, the whole thing was, when I first started, I did this, I started in 2001, right, after 
[02:25:30]  Survivor Series hit big, then I came on with Survivor Man and everything sort of flowed  from that.  The reality was that I could do the home video thing and it looked like a home video.  It would be crap.  You wouldn't want to watch the show.  But I'm also a filmmaker, right?  So I had a lot of passion in my filmmaking.  So I had to say, well, if I'm going to present what it's like to survive in the desert,  I also want to tell the story properly and well and use good cameras and good camera  angles.  And so my passion drove me to climb the cliff and put the camera up and show where I had to  go and do all that stuff.  Okay, see, I wasn't sure about your filmmaking background.  Yeah, I used to produce much music and, you know, I rock videos, all that sort of stuff. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, because every time I see one of those shots, I'm like, that son of a bitch climbed  up that thing, popped a friggin' tripod, got the shot, focused, and then went down, walked  across, had to check it, make sure it was good.  It's like, Jesus Christ, it's taking a while.  No wonder he's starving.  I'm not buying it.  No?  He's not buying it.  Time to admit you had another guy the whole time.  Yeah, oh yeah, I had a whole team of guys.  Yeah, crew.  Absolutely.  Stunt coordinators, safety climbers, all of it.  It's like, that's not him.  It looks like when Shatner's fighting in Star Trek, it's like, who's that guy? 
[02:26:30]  I hate him.  I got to ask the little boy question, man.  Were you ever scared sleeping in the middle of nowhere by yourself in the dark?  I used to go camping here once in a while, and we would be maybe a mile from everybody  else, and I was scared shitless.  I can't fucking fun and make believe I wasn't scared.  Every fucking noise drove me nuts.  Well, the worst for me was probably in Africa, because lions, polar bears, great white sharks,  they're opportunistic eaters, right?  So they are predators, and they'll eat you if they get opportunity. 
[02:27:00]  We can sugarcoat it, but that's the way it is.  And so when I was in lion territory, that and polar bear territory, but lion territory kind  of freaked me out.  I listened to an attack.  A lion attack happened just a few hundred yards away, and I was just sleeping around  like thorns all around me, and it was, it was, oh gosh, I can't remember.  He was attacking an animal.  Some died, some ungulate died, some hooked animal was dinner that night.  So you slept in thorns wise, they wouldn't stumble on you?  It's just a way of survival in Africa, you build these thorn corrals, you know, talk about 
[02:27:30]  sleeping out in the wild, you have to build the thorn corral around, and then go to sleep.  And it's not going to stop a lion, it's just going to slow them down a bit.  Yeah, yeah.  So that's the key.  And you're not really sleeping, you're opening that eye and just waiting for that sun  If you get 20 minutes, that's like a good slow one.  How do you defend yourself?  Do you have any weapons with you of any kind?  Maybe a club or something like that, the odd show, maybe I had a bow and arrow that I've  had, you know, but not much.  Just defend yourself with doing it right, you know, building the thorn corral.  Like I built that corral, and then I also built it around a tree base so that if it 
[02:28:00]  was coming in at me, at least I could go off the tree then, so you've got an escape  route.  I've always got to have an escape route.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  If he can't get through the thorns, you're going to have trouble going out the other end of the  thorn.  Yeah, exactly.  Like you're just trapped.  You're like a big thorn bull.  And that's assuming he's only like one of them.  It could be like a buffet of lions coming in.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  Look, I'm eating out of a thorn bull.  This is great.  Yeah, this is a little spiky, but this guy's delicious.  What about polar bears are scary?  They're huge, aren't they?  Yeah, polar bears, I mean, for a polar bear, you know, they're beautiful, and you can, 
[02:28:30]  yeah, you might be able to scare them away, and I'll just shoot a shotgun up in the  air, but the reality is you're a big walking pink seal to them.  You know, they're opportunistic eaters, just like a great white shark, you know?  Most animals are not predators.  They really don't want you.  Even grizzlies don't want you.  They could care less.  But polar bears are different.  I got to say for the marine biologists out there, because my brother is one, he would  disagree with the great white thing.  About it being a predator?  Yeah.  What ends up happening is they bump into you thinking you're something else.  They do bite, and then they don't want anything to do with you, in most cases. 
[02:29:00]  In most cases.  What about the cases where they don't?  You're right.  He's right.  The reality is that they do a taste test.  The problem is that their taste test, you lose an arm.  They really go, oh, I wonder what that is.  Nibble.  And then there goes my leg on the nibble.  And we call it a shark attack.  Right.  That said, they certainly have...  That's bad enough, obviously.  Yeah, it's bad enough, and they've eaten before.  I just had to bring it up, because I don't want to deal with the call from my brother  later.  He's right, though.  It's something they argue all the time, that they really don't want to eat humans.  Something tells me also, a hungry shark is going to eat you.  Sure.  It doesn't... 
[02:29:30]  He might be like, oh, well, this ain't as good as a seal, but...  He's right, though.  I mean, I spend a lot of time defending polar bears and great white sharks and lions for  the bad rap they get.  But in the end, no matter which way you slice it, people have been eaten by lions, people  have been eaten by tigers and great whites and polar bears.  And what I said doesn't matter, because if you're in the water and you see a shark,  you're not going, well, they don't really want me.  I'm staying in here.  Get the fuck out.  This one's got a nice look in his eye.  He'll be all right.  Did you swim with sharks?  I've hand-fed tons of...  I mean, I did Shark Week for three years, right?  Yeah.  I scuba dive. 
[02:30:00]  I haven't in a while, because I had a kid, unfortunately.  Not unfortunately for that, but unfortunately for my hobby.  Wow.  That you know of, anyway.  Wow.  And every time we jump in, the dive instructor's like, oh, hopefully we'll see a shark today.  And I'm the guy going, fuck, I don't need to see a fucking shark.  There's plenty of cool stuff down there.  I don't want to see one of those fucking things.  It's awesome, though.  I've ridden on the backs of tiger sharks and Caribbean reef sharks, hand-fed great whites,  and it's pretty awesome when you're down there and you see a shark.  It changes the diving experience.  Have you ever seen, help me out, largest animal, blue... 
[02:30:30]  Blue whale?  Is it the blue whale?  Blue whale.  100 yards.  Huge, yeah.  Have you ever seen one of those?  How do you know that?  Because I went to Marine Biology College.  100 yards.  I lied.  I have not seen...  I remember that when I was a kid.  You went to the Museum of Natural History.  No, when I was a kid in school, they were talking about blue whales.  They said, it's as big as this auditorium, and they said it was 100 yards.  And I was like, oh, I just remembered that fact.  Is that true?  They're that big?  Yeah, they're...  I mean, what I'm hoping to do is get in with a whale shark.  I haven't done the whale shark dive thing yet, which is pretty awesome.  The only whales I've seen is the killer whales up in the west coast of Canada. 
[02:31:00]  Sea kayak, they got chased by a sea lion, and sea kayaking passes killer whales, which is pretty awesome.  In the water itself, lots of sharks and tons of sharks, because I'm there for that.  I was there for Shark Week, right?  But, of course, we're feeding them.  We're throwing chum in the water.  It brings them all around.  That's a blue whale?  Yeah.  Wow.  I learned a lot about them when I was on a Japanese fishing boat.  My friends and I getting lamp oil and fun trinkets.  Shitty culture.  Fucking savages. 
[02:31:30]  There's eight whales left.  They're just little dicks.  They can't stop killing...  Eight whales left.  I can't stand that stupid murdered whale.  It annoys me.  Fucking whale fin.  If you eat whale fin, you should just be shot.  Unless you're surviving, it's different.  You saw the cove, right?  It made me want to fucking just bomb them all over again.  I was so irritated.  Wow.  Really annoyed me, that lack of respect for fucking...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rick O'Bear is a friend of mine, and yeah, absolutely.  When I was in Malaysia with the sea gypsies on Beyond Survival, we were talking through 
[02:32:00]  an interpreter, and they're shark finners.  I was like, yeah, well, you know.  And I asked us, well, where's...  They're saying there's no sharks here.  Well, what do you mean you don't have any sharks here?  They used to have tons of sharks there.  Oh, they went away somewhere.  I was like, yeah, they went away.  Well, it's because you finned them all and sold them to the market.  But then they throw them back in alive, like with their fins cut off.  They just have no...  What happens is, after you get the shit kicked out of you in a world war, and you're so humiliated  as a nation, honestly, you just lose regard for all of the life.  I really believe that's what happened.  Really? 
[02:32:30]  How could you be such a fucking...  Hunting is one thing.  How could you cut the fins off something and throw it back alive?  What kind of a terrible, terrible culture are you that you could do that?  What am I talking about?  Shut up.  Sorry.  That seems very cool.  You know, that's a bizarre thing, though.  You get all around the world, and you look at the different...  Like all these, like with Beyond Survival, with all those cultures that I survived with,  it's really hard because, yeah, a lot of them are doing things that, to them, they grew  up with, and you're going like, oh, man.  But you're right.  In the bigger nations, you just want to go, come on.  They don't know any better. 
[02:33:00]  You guys have scientists.  You guys have experts.  Come on.  You know what you're doing.  And I agree.  It's probably because they know what's going down.  It's efficient.  Don't care.  They don't care.  They don't care.  They don't care.  For what they're doing.  Where are the most...  Oh, I'm sorry.  No, no, no.  It's different in the jungle if you're hunting and you're eating.  If you're using saliva as a lubricant or a beverage, kill what you want.  If you think caribou guts are delicious when they're spoiled, you know what?  Kill what you want.  When they're spoiled, banging from a tree.  Where's the most...  And what was the most primitive culture you ever encountered? 
[02:33:30]  Probably...  I don't know if you guys saw these.  Probably the last show, which was the Mentuai in the Indonesian jungle.  And they tattooed me with a rusty nail and a stick.  Wow.  Why did you allow that?  Yeah, let's see that.  Wow.  That's fucking cool.  So I got...  That's on...  I got one on each shoulder.  And they do this.  If you watch the show, they have this little stick thing.  And it's like...  Yeah, yeah.  I've seen that.  And a jab.  It looks to be a bit painful. 
[02:34:00]  It was...  You know what?  On the other shoulder, they did it.  And then they tried to explain to me, oh, the shaman didn't put enough ink in.  We have to do it again.  And so it's like going over...  You know, you got a cut already, and then you stab the cut.  Oh, wow.  It was like all over again.  And I was like, okay, here we go.  How long did it take?  It was hours.  Les, can I tweet that?  Yeah, of course.  Wow, that is something.  People got to see that.  Homemade tattoo with a rusty nail.  Oh, man.  But they were pretty primitive?  Yeah, they were like...  They're beautiful, you know, in Stone Age.  Wow. 
[02:34:30]  Damn, you...  Oh, man.  Were you worried about getting tetanus or something, or...?  No, they rubbed me with, like, plants and things after, and in the stream.  They're putting it on this person's head.  Yeah, that's what I had done.  Exactly, exactly.  What was that tattoo mean?  Well, you know, that's the thing, and I say it in the show.  Everybody's got, like, intense meaning.  You know what they end up telling me?  They just like to make themselves look cool.  That's, you know, so much for the big...  Now, there is a story, like, these ones are supposed to be in relation to their relationship to the sun, 
[02:35:00]  which, at one point, they pushed farther back from the earth with their bows and arrows, and so...  But in the end, they just like to look good.  They're even hot.  Thanks for doing that.  You see the video that...  I think it just popped last week of that tribe, where the guy flew over in the plane that they were never discovered before, or whatever?  They've been known...  And it was the first contact, or the first video taken of these guys?  Maybe that might be the case, but they've been known about for a long time.  What tribe is it again?  I don't know the name, but there's 70 uncontacted tribes in the Amazon juggle.  And when I was in there with the Wadani, 16 or so miles or so away was a tribe called the Tagade, which were very aggressive. 
[02:35:30]  They were an offshoot.  And they said, you know, if we go down there in ones or twos, they'll just kill us.  If you go down there in a big group, you'll never find them.  And I was doing my Survivorman thing just upriver from them the whole week.  I'm like, oh, you've got to be kidding me.  Well, I didn't know until I got there, and then they told me.  Tagade?  Tagade, yes.  They're so isolated because they all have AT&T service.  They don't fuck around, though.  They'll kill you.  Not even think twice. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, well, because they're just protecting themselves.  I'm sure they don't have laws.  No, they're laws.  Yeah, they're laws.  They did.  The Wadani, really wonderful people that I learned from, but man, they were listed as the most violent people in history at one point.  Wow.  Yeah, like these are the people back in 57 or so massacred five missionaries.  And I met one of the guys, a guy named Dewey, was one of the guys involved in that massacre, and he was like a really beautiful man.  But he was like, for them, they thought they were being, you know, there was this whole thing that went on, and someone said, oh, they're here to kill us in that. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, was that like where they took the rock and?  No, they speared them all.  Oh, man.  They thought they were being attacked?  Yeah, and then what they never had in this culture, they never had the culture of forgiveness.  They didn't know what forgiveness was, so every single thing that happened was a vendetta, killing, like, oh, well, you tripped and hurt your ankle.  Well, that must be your fault, because I don't like you anyway, and you must have put that on me, so I need to kill your son.  And it was just on and on, and then now that you just go back and forth like this.  We have ancestors.  It's not like that now.  It's called management here.  Yeah. 
[02:37:00]  I love it.  Bad radio show.  We're taking your firstborn.  All right.  I love all the shots you're taking.  God bless you.  Why not?  Hey, I'm going to trust someone on Twitter.  I don't know this, so in case it's bad, I don't know.  You got a Bigfoot story?  Please ask Les Stroud about his Bigfoot story.  Maybe.  He means the guy in Strikeforce.  Did you find him?  It's a real story, yeah.  I would love to hear it if you want to tell him.  All right.  Well, when I was shooting, was this Beyond Survival?  No, Survivorman in Alaska. 
[02:37:30]  And it was not my first experience out there with something like this.  It's the second time.  And I was doing a shot.  You know, you see in Survivorman, you know, I do the shots and that.  And then the camera was put away over there.  And I was just like, in between shots, I'm still working.  So I've got to grab some more grass.  I'm getting more grass and shit.  And I hear this big rustle in the tree not too far from me.  And I freeze, right?  Because all the hairs went up in the back of my neck.  And I've been around grizzlies and moose and bear and all.  But this was different.  It felt weird. 
[02:38:00]  And I'm looking over at the camera.  I'm thinking, okay, okay, hang on a second.  If I could even just flip it on for the audio.  But it was too far away.  And I'm just standing there.  And I hear this rustle.  And then I hear this.  All right.  Now I've heard everything in the bush.  I've never heard a moose do that or a bear do that.  To me, that sounds like an ape, right?  Wow.  And he did it about five more times, really loud, 50 yards away.  And then when I finally made a movement to go get the camera, he went crashing off through the bush. 
[02:38:30]  I was like, the rest of that week out there alone, I was just like, holy crap.  And so I'm not going to say what it was.  I don't know what it was.  Is it possible it was an ape?  Was there a place indigenous to a...  Well, okay, let me ask you.  If somebody says to you, do you believe in Bigfoot?  You're going to roll your eyes and go, I don't know.  I call them Sasquatch.  Sasquatch.  Sasquatch, buddy.  But if someone says to you, do you think it's possible that small pockets of bipedal ape populations exist hidden away in the dark corners of the world that have a strong intuitive sense and sense energy? 
[02:39:00]  And then that's a different question to ask.  Then do you believe in Bigfoot?  And you go, oh, hang on a second.  Wouldn't we have found them already, though?  There's a whole big...  Well, what about the fish?  Those fish they found off New Jersey and the Philippines, extinct for 500 million years, they find like thousands of them in a school.  It's not like a fish that's going to end up in your garbage pail in your backyard, the rummaging for food.  And then you've got millions of anecdotal references from people who say, I had this, and this happened, and rocks are thrown at me.  What fish?  Silicont, I think it was called.  Silicont.  Silicont.  That's a female comedian. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, here we go.  Jimmy, show over.  Someone had to go there.  We're not doing better than that one.  What?  Wait, wait.  That did not come from me.  No, of course not.  I think it would be tougher to discover everything living in the oceans.  Sure it would, yeah.  But as far as on land, you really think there's stuff out there we still haven't discovered?  Yeah, for sure.  And I'm not talking about maybe tiny shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm talking about sizable shit.  They're still finding mammals in Papua New Guinea and birds and things like that, and that's fairly sizable. 
[02:40:00]  I mean, it's not like they've gone out and done the whole sort of army satellite heat camera thing to try and find sassbots.  They haven't done that, you know.  But why haven't we?  It's always, I don't know, money.  There's so much interest in the whole Grateful thing.  It'd be cool if someone, I've been asked to do it as a series.  Why haven't we really fucking gone out there and answered this question once and for all?  Let's just get one and kill it.  And why haven't we found any dead ones?  That was always my question.  That's a good idea.  But then the question is, how often do you find a dead moose? 
[02:40:30]  I would imagine.  Because within moments, it's eaten up.  You know, wolves, ravens, coyotes.  When do you find a dead bear?  It dies.  But we have found them.  I haven't found any, but have you found, I mean, when, where?  Or maybe some antlers.  It happens.  Rarity, yep.  Byproducts thereof.  But you've got to, okay, but that's because there's millions or hundreds of thousands of  moose.  It's hard to argue with that because you're in the woods more than me, but.  Well, let's say there's only eight Sasquatch here and four over there and three over there.  You know, now you're trying to find that dead skeleton. 
[02:41:00]  Like, I agree with you.  Why haven't we found any skeletons?  Because, well, then it's like, wait a minute, there's hundreds of thousands of moose.  That's why, you know, a hunter stumbles upon a skeleton.  You know, or.  But I guess they have footprints, right?  Yeah.  So many of them have been hoaxed, though.  The footprints, like the biggest ones of all that have made it as hoaxes.  Even the guy in the camera with the Bigfoot, yeah, where it looks like he's actually trying  to do some kind of a shuffle.  He is dancing.  The best part was when Jim Carrey did that in the Who remake when they shot him as the  Grinch in the same pose. 
[02:41:30]  It is such an obscure reference, but everyone seems to.  I know.  I like that.  I was assuming if you were awake for that one.  The California Woods.  The two early in the morning for that?  No.  No, I love that.  Well, you knew it.  You got it, though.  I know that one, yeah.  It's great.  1967.  I used to watch those all the time, In Search Of.  Oh, yeah.  Arcane reference.  Leonard Nimoy.  Hey, what do you think they're going to find under the, they're drilling in this lake that's  been covered by ice for like.  Monsters!  That's exactly what I was thinking.  Sasquatch.  For like 13 million years in Russia, the Russia or something in Greenland or something.  It's been covered by ice for like 13 million years and they're drilling into it to see 
[02:42:00]  what's alive.  I think there's still water underneath.  Really?  Yeah.  And it's been isolated?  Yeah.  I'll look, I'll Google it because I didn't just totally stop the conversation with a dumb  child.  The thing that freaks me out on the deep drilling on that is when they get into, and I don't  know, I don't know about this, but it's the whole like, how deep are they tapping  into it?  What are they tapping into in terms of earthquake zones and water zones?  Yeah.  That's the stuff that's kind of freaky.  It's like, you know, when, when they, is that just conspiracy crap or is at some point 
[02:42:30]  someone's going to tap into a vein of something that just goes, thank you, bang!  Yeah.  Ah, pressure release.  Yeah.  Exactly.  It's a lake in Antarctica.  It's been isolated from everything else on earth for 15 million years.  You're probably going to find rock and water.  Yeah, maybe.  That's great.  We've confirmed.  There's rocks down there.  It's beneath 13,000 feet of ice.  That's like what, almost four miles?  It's a big skating rink.  That's a lot of ice.  Yeah.  Damn, that's a lot of ice.  Imagine if there's a guy underneath, like, what the fuck?  Hey, thanks. 
[02:43:00]  I've been waiting.  Or a hat store.  Cro-Magnum man down there.  Yeah.  Something totally bizarre.  They're looking to, I guess, clone a mammoth or mastodon.  What's going to happen with them?  Do the Jurassic Park thing?  Do the permafrost.  Yeah.  Take some of the DNA.  Take a cell.  Use an elephant, I guess, to get the cell to start dividing.  Use that little electrical charge.  Bam!  And then maybe have a little woolly mammoth.  Well, clearly Steven Spielberg showed that it was possible. 
[02:43:30]  Yes.  So, you know.  Yeah.  That would be interesting, though, to be able to see that.  It's probably coming.  There's a moral question.  The Jurassic Park is probably not that far off.  Yeah, yeah.  It's probably coming, yeah.  That is a little creepy.  And the moral question will just be shelved in the name of science anyway.  And amusement parks.  Yeah.  They had another article on woolly mammoths.  It's happened.  They're hoping within six years.  Really?  Really?  There is.  This article just hit a couple days ago.  They look like a weird smell, so I just cloned woolly mammoth in five years.  I'd pet one, but they'd probably stink. 
[02:44:00]  I guess because they've got actual organic material now, not just fossil, right?  Yeah, yeah.  They pulled that out of, I think it was the Arctic they've got there.  God, look at that thing.  It just looks so prehistoric.  But it's really even doing it once it's cloned.  Put it in a zoo and charge people.  They're not starting small, are they?  It's like, we're going to clone a cricket.  We decided to start with the woolly mammoth just to see.  That is something.  Oh, Dolly the sheep.  Yeah, they cloned that thing.  It would be great, though.  Dolly the mammoth?  Yeah, but nature said goodbye to that fucking monstrosity 10 million years ago. 
[02:44:30]  They obviously, they weren't meant to be here.  Maybe 100,000.  Big dumb hairy elephant.  10,000 years ago.  Take an elephant in a vest.  Fuck it.  I like regular elephants.  A elephant in a vest.  They may want to be here, though.  That's true.  I'm sure they'll be happy.  Yeah, hey.  Hey, remember me?  That would be odd, though, to see things like that.  And then dinosaurs would just be ridiculous.  I don't think the climate would be very good for dinosaurs, though, now.  The city?  They'd hate it.  No, I don't mean the city.  I mean the cab running over their dumb feet.  The social climate.  The social climate's all wrong.  You know?  Yeah. 
[02:45:00]  They'd never adopt a political correctness.  Their little teeny arms.  Ninosaur's are dicks.  I'm definitely going to...  They can't reach their penis.  I'm definitely reading this one, though.  Yeah.  This is, like, right up my alley.  You'd be a great guy to have around for an apocalypse or something.  Like, you know, or zombie invasion.  Yeah.  Anything where you need...  Well, you know, you touched on something there.  Yeah.  All I'm going to say is there's something coming on that with me.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's all I can say.  All right.  And I might have an idea what it is, but okay. 
[02:45:30]  All right.  All right.  All right.  That's kind of cool, because zombies have just taken off.  Holy crap.  People are really fascinated with the whole zombie thing and contingency plans, what you  would do, what works, what doesn't work.  And it is fascinating, even though they're completely, you know...  I know people that actually go to a city, and they scope out the escape route first.  It's like, okay, what's my escape...  In case the zombie apocalypse happens while we're visiting your aunt in Milwaukee.  You've got to know where to go.  I want to know where we go.  That's prepared. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  That's bizarre.  That's what it is.  That's what it is.  Yeah.  My son's big into the whole Call of Duty zombies.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's, like, killing zombies every afternoon.  Yeah, Call of Duty zombies is pretty fun to play.  Yeah, that's pretty wild.  That's a good one.  I think it's bigger than vampires now, the whole zombie thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's the one movie genre that's never taken a loss.  Every zombie movie makes a profit.  Wow.  Every single one.  They are just...  It's bizarre.  People love that whole concept of having to survive in that post-apocalyptic world.  Yeah. 
[02:46:30]  And especially when you throw zombies in.  But I think any kind of post-apocalyptic survival thing is intriguing to people.  I know I love it.  I think I would love to see that part of history.  See the end of the world.  It's off-the-scale, too.  It's off-the-scale survival.  It's not like when we do the expansion of Survivorman and the camping and all that sort  of stuff.  This is off-the-scale stuff.  Now it's like, all right.  And then you throw in the fantasy, which is the zombies, or just the apocalyptic, like 
[02:47:00]  the road.  It's like, okay.  It's why the road, I guess, because you watch the road going, huh.  Okay, that almost kind of makes sense.  You know, that's kind of what it would be like.  You know, there's no zombies.  It's just walking.  But there's horrid people that would do you harm with no laws, no consequences, cannibalism.  Is the road good?  Yeah, I liked the road.  The book?  I read the book.  Book?  I liked the book.  That was about a guy and his son who survived the apocalypse.  I should read that, because I've heard it.  It's a huge bestseller.  I've never seen the movie.  Who's in the movie?  The movie, oh, Morkinson. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Vigo.  I think our boy, Michael K. Williams, has a role in that, too, right?  Is that the one he's in?  I don't know.  Does he?  I think so.  I hope they match the father and son up right.  That'd be terrible.  Hey, got a good question coming in from Rick in D.C.  We got Les Stroud in studio, Survivorman, who's got a new book, Will to Live, Dispatches  from the Edge of Survival.  There you go.  Rick, what's up?  Hey, Jimmy doesn't like milk.  He hates milk.  But I wanted to know from Les, what's the weirdest milk he's ever drank, and did he drink it 
[02:48:00]  directly from the tap?  That's a good question.  Weirdest milk?  Weirdest milk.  Man, just bad milk, but not on Survivorman.  It was a hunting situation, and moose.  Moose milk.  Yeah, and blood.  That's got to be gamey.  Yeah.  Is there blood in moose milk?  Well, it's, you know, I think, isn't milk kind of like blood with just the white platelets  or something?  I don't know.  I'm talking about it.  Oh, Jesus.  Is that what milk is?  Isn't it?  I think, I checked, I don't know. 
[02:48:30]  You'd have to Google that.  I think it's, I think that's the deal there.  But, like Jamie, I'm not, oh, here's got the dairy board after me.  I'm not a fan of milk at all.  My kids haven't drank milk ever.  No, no.  I haven't had it in years.  I would love to do the, yeah, no, I think the whole, the whole, oh, the milk board's going  to hate me.  They're saying no, it's not that.  The whole calcium thing, and no, it's milk blood without the hemoglobin.  They're saying no.  No, it's not.  It's got the same pH resemblance.  I just know I don't drink milk.  I don't either. 
[02:49:00]  No.  It makes your breath stink.  With that, we definitely got to get less out.  I'm hearing you've got phone calls and stuff.  Oh, okay.  We don't want to.  Yeah, I'm frightfully busy.  Got to go, man.  All right, busy man.  Book looks great.  Thank you.  Loving all the pictures, and God, love having you on the show, too, Les.  Thanks, man.  Yeah, Les is a good guy.  We look forward to your next project.  Very exciting.  Thanks, guys.  All right, Les Stroud, everyone.  The book's called Will to Live.  Check it out.  Series XM.  The virus.  Get in touch with the Opie and Anthony Show.  866-969-1969. 
[02:49:30]  Cell phone and PDA users.  Send your feedback to feedback at opiananthony.com.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Fucking Les was cool, huh?  Yeah.  Like him.  He's all right.  Opie and Anthony, yeah.  Dan had a very funny line.  We're just in the break as we're coming back.  I missed it.  I said something about, Opie said, hey, man, he has a tattoo that means something.  That's like a tribal tattoo.  It's kind of cool.  I got a tat, but I'm not a tattoo guy. 
[02:50:00]  But I would, yeah, man, that's the type of tattoo I would get in a second.  And I said, it would scare me because the hygiene, I'm like, you know, they're not exactly,  they don't disinfect.  They have the hygiene of wild boars.  And then Anne said, speaking of wild boars, we're on now.  And then the music started.  It made me really laugh.  We really do suck.  Wild boars.  They'll never be on to that.  Dopes.  Hey, should we do the news story about the kid and the pot? 
[02:50:30]  Yay.  The kid and the pot.  Oh, yeah.  He smoked it.  Or we get the video of the most polite armed robbery ever, which is going around.  I would like to see that.  That's pretty funny, too.  By the way, in Chicago, the ACLU is bitching about all these cameras that are up.  I bet you it's a bunch of white ACLU people who don't have to live in black neighborhoods  and deal with the crime.  I guarantee it's a bunch of people that don't have to deal with the crime.  God.  Yeah.  I want to hear about the polite robbery, though.  That's why more and more kids' youths are walking around with the hoods up. 
[02:51:00]  Right, right.  Because they don't want to be on camera.  Oh.  How did we learn that?  We learned that somebody from across the pond told us that.  That was in here recently.  Across the pond.  Oh.  Yeah.  That makes sense.  Yeah.  Fucking Arnie Hemlin when he came in.  Arnie.  That's right.  The great Arnie.  Yes.  What's up with this lake you're obsessed with?  I didn't even hear about this until you told Les.  It's, well, I got it actually from, I heard about it from Joe Rogan.  It's a, let me see, what's it called?  Lake Vostok, I think it's in Antarctica. 
[02:51:30]  I'm going to have vacation there.  And I was drilling one time, and I hit 13,000 feet down, and I said, there's a lake under  this ice, but there's satellite photos of it.  Isn't the whole thing a lake if it's ice?  No, it's like probably flowing water over ice.  There's water under it that's actually water, and they said it has water under the water,  and they said, well, that water.  Water at the bottom of the ocean.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, right on, talking heads.  I'm all in on the talking heads.  And they say it's 13,000 feet of ice, which is, you know, at 5,000 feet a mile, that's almost 
[02:52:00]  three miles.  Isn't that just more water that, it's so down, it didn't freeze?  I don't know how that, maybe the earth keeps it warm.  Can someone explain this to me?  It probably does.  It's probably so far down.  And it looks like there's some kind of a little thing there, maybe a tunnel, a little crack,  a fault that goes down into some heat.  And they, it literally has been untouched by air or anything for 15 million years.  Wow.  So the Russians are drilling into it, but they're being very careful.  They don't want to disturb the ecosystem or whatever. 
[02:52:30]  What's down there?  There's nothing, no light.  It's pitch black.  It's freezing cold.  No, there's some shit down there.  I know.  You'd be surprised, man.  Planet Earth and life, like when they do, like, the cave episodes and shit.  I love those, the things that make their own light.  Yeah, those.  It's got, like, I like those fish with the headlights on his head, yeah.  Oh, those are the seminiferous tubalodial butt noids.  Oh, right.  You're thinking of beavis and butt noids.  Yeah, it's butt noids.  Or the, uh, the lights on the head is so that they could find the way out of your butt.  Jesus.  I forgot about that. 
[02:53:00]  The, uh, the lake, uh, yeah, you're right.  There might be, there's got to be something alive down there because there's, like, the bottom  of the ocean, they can survive under all that pressure from the water where it's X amount of  tons of pressure, like the things that would crush you and I or, yeah, there's life down there.  Some fossils?  There's something down there, man.  I don't know why.  There's something living.  It would, it would be really great if it was something cool.  Yeah.  Big dinosaur-y thing.  Like one, one really uncomfortable fucking elk who just can't get out because the ice forms over him. 
[02:53:30]  And just yells about time.  Yeah, yeah.  Where have you guys been?  Oh, God.  Or one guy with a chisel or something else that's not funny, I could say.  I know.  Jesus, two in a row duds, I'm going to go for eight.  A seahorse, we got it, Jim.  Weird things.  This seems to me like the Russians doing it.  They're just like, they're like, just keep drilling, don't care what's there.  No, it took them years to get the rights to it.  It was a huge undertaking because, again, this is, like, completely pristine.  Yeah.  So they don't want to kind of go in and fuck it up, but shit.  I bet the water is good. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, God.  But the bacteria that's been in there for so long, it might not be good.  It might be horrible.  Imagine how refreshing that water would be.  Oh, freezing cold.  Oh, fuck.  Fucking bad.  Yeah, 15 million-year-old organisms.  That hasn't been touched in 15 billion years or million, whatever.  Like, there's organisms in our own water.  Why not have some fucking...  Because there are organisms.  Who knows what's under there?  It could be fucking something.  It could be a dinosaur clit.  Turn you into the...  Into the Hulk.  What if it's stuff that makes you smarter?  Yeah. 
[02:54:30]  Then I would probably drink a lot of it.  They would call me the Vostok Lake kid.  Kid.  And by the way, I'm calling it no meetings as we walk toward the elevator today.  Wow.  Yeah.  What the fuck is that?  No meetings today.  Oh, I've had my dick sucked by mouths like that.  That thing is fucked up looking.  Is that swimming or it looks like he's dancing?  What is this?  It's a fish.  It's a fish.  It's got a light on its head.  It's a monster.  It's bioluminescent fish.  Well, these things are so far down in the ocean.  How far down?  There's this guy below.  That's 40, 50 feet down. 
[02:55:00]  You know, perhaps.  What are they?  A mile down?  I'd have to look.  I think it might even be more.  It's like the deepest, darkest depths of the ocean.  It looks like a UFO.  It's just cruising with these flashing light on its face.  Do you know how mad people would be if the Russians said that they just wanted to nuke that lake for no reason?  They wanted to use it as nuclear testing Antarctica and drop breadcrumbs in there just to feed the fish.  You know how mad they'd be if they were dropping little pieces of boiled up bread to feed the fish? 
[02:55:30]  No scientific value whatsoever.  Yeah, they just wanted to feed whatever's down there and they wanted to fart and see if it could go all the way into the tube in the water.  Awful Russian fucking kraut farts.  Beer.  I would break you.  Are you sure this is illegal?  You're listening to The Fire, Sirius 197 XM 202.  Have you ever wondered how much vomit it would take to fill up a Crown Victoria?  How many nipples would it take to blanket Rhode Island? 
[02:56:00]  Well, wonder no more, friends.  Join me on my journey of knowledge and discovery to find answers to some of the awe-inspiring questions man has pondered since the dawn of time.  Today, we'll answer the question, how many clits would it take to fill up a bathtub?  With the average adult clit measuring 46.25 cubic millimeters and one gallon equaling 3,785,412 cubic millimeters,  that means there are 81,846 clits per gallon, or CPG. 
[02:56:30]  The average U.S. bathtub can hold 60 gallons.  That brings us to a grand total of 4,910,760 clits to fill a bathtub.  If you stack the average clit end-to-end, you would need 96.5 billion clits to get from the Earth to the Moon.  So get slicing, you tribesmen.  You expect me to cut off all those clits myself? 
[02:57:00]  Stay tuned for another edition of How Much?  This is a virus.  Sirius XM.  On the next episode of American Fuckers, Mike and Frank travel the back roads of America looking for rusty gold.  We are, man. We're in the mantiques.  We're making rust hot.  Me and Frankie are the rock stars of rust.  They're looking for amazing antiques to fuck buried in people's garages and barns.  What happens is you get in these barns and stuff, and I'll f*** anything that's transportation-related. 
[02:57:30]  If I f*** a 1913 Indian in a barn, if I f*** a 1913 Harley in a barn.  Yeah, it's hard to really get the boner on.  Yeah, that's hard to f***, you know what I mean?  What most people see as junk, they try and stick their dicks into.  Oil cans, gas pumps, everything.  Different heights, sizes, shapes, everything.  Four wheels, two wheels, you know, memorabilia.  Beer cans, that was smoking, man.  I did high-five them. I was like, dude, that was awesome.  We can't just be a one-trick pony.  I mean, we've got a f***ing lot of different things.  You know, all of a sudden, Brass Blade fans are hot.  I love Brass Blade fans. 
[02:58:00]  I want to dry hump a Brass Blade fan.  They're f***ing the history of America one piece at a time.  You know, nothing surprises us anymore, I don't think.  We're f***ing cool stuff.  The cool thing about us is, you know, we get excited about just about anything.  You know, we're just looking for stuff we have never f***ed before.  Find out which forgotten relics will get f***ed.  Yeah, woo!  All on the next episode of American Fuckers. </pre>
