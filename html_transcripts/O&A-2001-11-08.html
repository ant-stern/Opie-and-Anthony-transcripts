<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts using offensive language targeting Middle Eastern people, before transitioning to a critique of CNN's 9/11 coverage, particularly their portrayal of Afghan children's grief. Opie voiced anger and offered a contrasting perspective.  A large portion focused on the "WOW" campaign, involving car stickers and women flashing their breasts.  An email criticizing the campaign as degrading to women prompted a debate about free will and the campaign's impact, with the hosts maintaining that participation was voluntary.  Listener calls highlighted a massive "WOW" sign at WWE Smackdown, leading to a contest for a trip to the Survivor Series, and revealed a San Jose radio station had copied the campaign.  The show also included discussion and laughter over a *South Park* episode featuring Osama Bin Laden.

A significant portion of the show revolved around a caller named Peggy, who recounted a past sexual encounter with a deceased New York radio DJ, "Oogie Pringle," in graphic detail, including her state of undress and the circumstances.  The hosts and callers speculated about Oogie Pringle's identity and eventual suicide in 1987.  Peggy was invited to the studio for a future appearance.  David Wells and Hooters Girls were mentioned as planned guests.

The next segment began with further discussion of Peggy, described as an "old broad," and an email from Jody criticizing the "WOW" campaign's middle-finger variation. The hosts mocked Jody, claiming it would only boost the campaign's notoriety.  Baseball player David Wells then arrived in studio with Hooters girls.  The conversation covered Wells' career, his perfect game, a potential Yankees return, and opinions on various teams and cities.  Numerous listener calls expressed opinions on Wells, the Hooters girls, and the "WOW" campaign. Peggy was brought back on air, and teased about her age and attraction to Wells.  The Hooters girls and Wells departed, with the hosts commenting on their exit and a final caller sharing a humorous anecdote about Wells.  The show mentioned proceeds from Wells' merchandise would benefit 9/11 victims' families.  Vulgar language and sexually suggestive remarks were prevalent throughout.

A following segment discussed perceived changes in New York City crime rates post-9/11, sparked by a caller's question. A guest, "Old Dirty," expressed mixed feelings about the police, leading to a heated debate with callers, including police officers, exchanging insults over police brutality, racial profiling, and perceived hypocrisy.  Peggy returned, engaging in sexually explicit conversation detailing her drug use and sexual preferences. Other callers shared opinions on the police, racial issues, and engaged in vulgar and sexually suggestive comments.  A discussion on penis size and enhancement followed, with personal anecdotes.

The final segment consisted of heavily explicit conversations about sex and relationships, including graphic descriptions of sexual acts, penis size, and female anatomy.  The importance of physical attributes, especially feet, in sexual attraction was debated. A caller recounted a sexual encounter with an older woman, and the hosts invented a sexual position, "The Wayne Gretzky." The "What Did We Learn Today?" segment featured absurd and humorous (and often vulgar) caller anecdotes. The broadcast concluded with ticket giveaways and a final vulgar send-off. No specific guests were identified in the studio for this segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I don't want to get that track, fellas!  Oh, who's all doing?  Sand monkeys!  Towel heads!  Sand monkeys!  Towel heads! 
[00:00:30]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show!  Hello!  Hello, hello!  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-2774-WOW.  That's 866-2774-WOW.  If you want instant feedback of the show, just go to Opie and Anthony.  Dot com, and there's a link to do that as well. 
[00:01:00]  What is Ben laughing at right off the bat?  I haven't got somebody on the You Drop Something game.  Well, we were, we guess we're playing those clips.  Oh, really?  What, someone came in?  Oh, yeah.  You dropped something.  Looking all around.  That is a great gag.  You almost broke a hip turning, dude.  That is a great gag.  Looking back in, like, what the hell is going on?  You guys are, like, you know, hitting buttons and stuff.  It was hilarious.  I got a quick F.U. to start off the show, even though it's not F.U. Friday. 
[00:01:30]  All right.  This just can't wait.  We're in the office.  We're watching CNN.  Oh.  How many more little Afghani children are they going to show bad mouth in the United States  of America?  I understand we're killing some of their parents, but for God's sake, how about putting some  of the kids of the people that died in the World Trade Center on TV?  Well, they were bad mouthing the United States?  They showed this little Afghani girl who had escaped to Pakistan, and she's crying that 
[00:02:00]  some of her relatives were killed by the Americans.  The Americans killed my family, she says.  And then the CNN reporters, who are all sluts and bastards, are saying she even draws pictures  of the horrors, pictures of airplanes and buildings.  Hey, excuse me.  I think our school children were jotting that stuff down themselves.  Airplanes and buildings.  They're making some cute drawings themselves. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  So they show the pictures of the airplanes and the bombs dropping in buildings and dead people  on the ground.  Hey, CNN.  Something happened here, too.  It's the whole reason we're doing this.  There's a whole reason behind it.  I'm thinking if they're going to play these little kids crying about their parents getting  blown up, it's got to be done through a transparent background of what happened on the 11th.  There you go.  That way, it's a constant reminder.  The second any of these liberal pantyways start feeling a little sorry for anybody, they 
[00:03:00]  could just look at the background and say, oh, yeah, that's why we're bombing these people  into oblivion.  So my FU to CNN.  You don't see Fox News doing that.  You know what you should be doing?  I'll go in with an AK and take care of it.  Yes, Jim?  These kids in Afghanistan, if they're losing their parents, we can always bring them over  here and turn them over to this couple in Staten Island, I'm sure.  Oh, yes.  Yes, man.  You know, that story had Sandy crying this morning.  That could be the most enraging thing I've ever read. 
[00:03:30]  And people don't believe in the death penalty.  Yeah.  Why don't you read this story?  Read a little bit of this one to the fine folks that don't believe in the death penalty.  Age 14.  Why should these people walk the earth?  It's a couple that killed a three-year-old daughter.  And the father, because she went to the bathroom in her pants.  Oh, who hit that button?  And the father scrubbed the girl's legs and backside with a Brillo pad, burning her raw  skin with alcohol and peroxide, and then made her eat soap. 
[00:04:00]  And they put her face in ice-cold water.  And the both of the parents just had their throats cut.  That's not funny.  That's stupid.  What?  That's just stupid.  Of course it is.  Oh, Jesus.  Bunch of fun in the world today. 
[00:04:30]  Lots of fun in the world.  Keith, what's up?  Hey, fellas.  What's going on?  How are you?  All right, bro.  Listen, I think we might have an enemy of the show today.  What do you mean?  Seems I got a mass mailing today from somebody on AOL, trashing the WOW campaign.  Yeah, we've seen this.  Oh, you did see it?  You got it already?  Well, yeah, I got it in front of me.  A bunch of people have sent the email in.  Oh, okay, good.  You know, this lady's so stupid because she's just going to make WOW even bigger.  Yeah.  If you don't like WOW ladies, then just keep your mouth shut. 
[00:05:00]  Every campaign they have tried to shut down, whip them out Wednesday, has failed miserably.  Ask them up in Boston.  Man, some woman did a story on it in The Globe, I believe it was.  Were you trying to remember her name?  McNamara.  Eileen?  Eileen McNamara?  No.  Did anyone try this phone number yet?  Yeah.  We all left our lovely messages.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  I think we should encourage everybody to leave a serious... 
[00:05:30]  Well, unfortunately, we can't get the phone number out on the air.  But if you get the email, it just may end up on a message board somewhere or a website.  Who knows?  It's being emailed all over the place.  Let's see if we can check and see if that's up on the message board in a couple minutes.  You know, this enrages the listeners of the Opie and Anthony show and know what they end up doing.  They end up putting more WOW signs on their cars, more WOW signs on buildings.  This lady doesn't get it.  She's just going to make Whip Them Out Wednesday that much bigger.  I think she's secretly a fan of the show.  And she's just trying to help us out. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, that would be nice.  So, this is the email that's going around.  I'll even give her some publicity today, okay?  Sure.  WOW, this was a great promotional idea up until they began distributing stickers to the ugliest of men around.  Any man who has to stick a sticker in their car and pray that somebody flashes them is gross.  What's the matter?  Can't get any at home?  For all those women who are bored and disgusted with this promotion, read on.  I'm encouraging all you to participate in WOW by whipping out your middle finger. 
[00:06:30]  Whip out your middle finger not only on Wednesdays but every day of the week.  Damn, she's fighting back.  WOW guys are gross.  Let's show them how gross they are.  Whip out your middle finger.  There you go.  And diddle with it.  Forward on to all men and women this email.  When men see that we think they are ugly and the only thing they are going to get is the middle finger,  Opie and Anthony will have to come up with some other promotional idea that is not degrading to women. 
[00:07:00]  There it is.  How about Dot?  Which is D on Tuesday.  What?  I agree with her actually.  I think it's degrading and that what people should do, instead of the breast being shown or something,  drive by and thumbs up each other.  Thumbs up.  That's a feel good kind of thing.  Thumbs up Thursday.  Or maybe show a picture of Hedda Nussbaum and point and laugh.  You know, if you don't want to whip out your breast, just laugh at Hedda Nussbaum's bruised photo.  Hedda.  Always funny.  Always. 
[00:07:30]  And then it says, thank you for listening.  So this email is going to everybody.  And I encourage even the fans of WOW to send it on to other people.  Sure.  It'll just promote the hell out of Whip-em-Out Wednesday.  How is WOW degrading to women?  I've never figured that out.  If you put a WOW in your car, whether it's to support this program or to hopefully see a lovely young lady drive up and show her breasts to you,  how is that degrading?  It's the girl's decision.  The guy does nothing but put the WOW on his car. 
[00:08:00]  And hope for the best.  And if she decides with her own brain that she wants to WOW, she does it.  If she doesn't want to do it, she doesn't do it.  It's called free will.  It's called freedom to be yourself.  And I don't think a group, a woman's group or anybody else, should be telling women what they can or can't do based on their own morality.  That seems a little like they're saying that women aren't intelligent enough to make decisions for themselves. 
[00:08:30]  And they need to group up and have these groups make their decisions for them.  And you know what's interesting is that they're all gathering together and getting their gals in a rally.  And then, you know, because it's degrading to women.  But apparently, if you're a Democratic president, you stick your mule in every hole that's moving, even subordinates.  That's not degrading to women because they won't speak out.  They never spoke out on the Abraham Lincoln thing.  That's what you're talking about, right?  Yeah, exactly.  He had his mule out.  He was shot for it.  I remember that.  Yeah, they never spoke out about that. 
[00:09:00]  That's more hypocrisy.  I thought he was a wig.  Wasn't he part of the wig party?  W-H-I-G.  The wig party.  Wig.  All wigs, please remove your trousers.  So this lady is just playing right into our hands.  If you get this email, please send it to all your friends and people that have never heard of the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  All right.  And remember, there's some simple rules to wow.  Don't force the ladies to do it.  Don't follow them. 
[00:09:30]  Just put the wow in your car.  And if the ladies feel like it, they're going to do it.  And there's plenty of ladies that will do it because they want to do it.  Right.  They've made that choice for themselves.  Well, it's interesting you say don't force them or follow them.  The same laws that apply to wow are also rape and stalking laws in our country.  Keith, is that it?  I think that's it.  Keith, could you just see if there was something going around where guys could just maybe,  go out somewhere and get their knob hobbed. 
[00:10:00]  And all of a sudden, a big gaggle of guys got around and put out a mail saying, this is horrible.  It's degrading to men that this would happen.  I mean, well, doesn't it just seem we just we just we don't do that.  We just think differently.  Yeah.  The thing is, you know, but there is that similarity that we can.  Oh, jeez.  I don't want to get the age, fellas.  There is that similarity where we all make our own choices in life.  And you don't need a group to be sending out mailers to tell everybody how they believe women should be treated 
[00:10:30]  and how women should act.  You know what I mean?  It's it's I think men and women both can can believe in that.  But that's ridiculous.  There is a thing, though, where lots of men can get together and get their knobs hobbed.  It's called a road show.  Hey, Dave, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony show.  What's up today?  Yeah, guys.  Hey, I called in on Tuesday to tell you guys about that wow sign. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  It will be up.  Oh, what?  On Smackdown tonight?  Yeah, I got it on maybe like 10 times.  Oh, beautiful.  Is this the wow sign that's like 30 feet?  30 feet long.  Massive.  Awesome.  That's great.  The cool thing is two chicks in front after he put it up the first time.  Yeah.  Said next time we'll do it.  They're going to wow for us.  Right.  So every time after that, there's two girls in front of the wow sign that wow the camera.  They were wowing the camera?  Oh, they were.  Yeah, they're not going to show that on Smackdown.  I don't know.  They left their bra on sometimes. 
[00:11:30]  That's cool.  Hey, here's the deal.  We have a trip to WWF Survivor Series in North Carolina.  Oh.  And we have some serious competition going on.  We love when we get the wow signs on live TV.  We absolutely love it.  The best one ever was the wowing on the Today Show.  Yeah, that was good.  We're hoping someday that some lady will beat that.  Yeah, because that was huge.  National.  We tried, but this is a taping, so I don't know if we'll show it.  She was topless and also had the Opie and Anthony Wow sticker.  That was a perfect combination.  Yeah, that's good stuff.  But we have a competition going on, Long Island, Raw, out there at the Coliseum. 
[00:12:00]  We are well represented with the wow signs and the O&A signs.  Well, tonight we got the wow.  We got you guys.  We also got a hot patty sign.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, this is the deal.  After Smackdown tonight, we're going to have the listeners decide who had the best wow sign  or the best O&A sign on WWF.  And guess what?  That person will be going to the WWF Survivor Series.  Oh, there you go.  That would be great.  All right.  So I guess we'll start the competition tomorrow. 
[00:12:30]  Cool.  That might F us up because I think they want us to give the trip away today, but we'll have  to talk to the WWF.  No way.  Yeah, because, I mean, if the sign is as big as you're saying and it got on live TV or  Smackdown, whatever, tape live, whatever, then come on.  We got to reward you for that.  I could see WWF getting mad at us for having a contest that includes people watching their  programming.  Yeah.  Sure.  Sure.  Sure.  I think they'll be mad.  Sure.  Yeah.  No, they'll understand.  Of course they will.  Because we've been trying to figure out how to give away this Survivor Series trip and 
[00:13:00]  come on, what a better way than someone that loves wrestling, so they're there and they're  also supporting the Opie and Anthony show.  Right.  Big sense.  Perfect.  All right, Dave.  We'll all be watching Smackdown tonight and then tomorrow you guys all have to call us  and tell us which sign was the best.  All right, cool.  The ones from Monday or the ones that you see tonight.  All right, cool.  All right, thanks, Dave.  All right, man.  There you go.  Don't have to worry about giving away the trip, guys.  Nice.  Taking care of.  One of the day's issues resolved.  Pull that one out of our A's. 
[00:13:30]  Frank, what's going on?  You're next on the O&A show.  Yeah.  Did you see South Park last night?  We just lost it.  The thing with Cartman playing Bugs Bunny to Osama Bin Laden was like the funniest thing,  especially when they had the multiple magnifying glasses.  Yeah.  They showed that he had a little mule.  They thought the donkey or the goat was Stevie there.  That was awesome.  You know, I guess the easiest thing to do is if you haven't seen South Park, they rerun 
[00:14:00]  it over the weekend.  What?  What?  I think it was an episode tonight.  Hey, I think you guys got your own little Terry.  I heard you got your own little Terry Recalta thing going on you.  Huh?  Married with children.  A few years ago, that lady was complaining and it gave them the ratings that they...  I'm going to...  Very good.  Opie, I was hoping you would do that.  Cutting our losses.  You helped that man out.  Nice.  Vic, what's going on?  Hey, Vic.  Oh, my God.  Vic, Rick, Nick, douchebag, whoever you are.  I don't like that joke about Bin Laden because that's degrading to men to make fun of genital 
[00:14:30]  thighs, guys.  Right.  See?  Let's all rally around.  You know, we might not agree with Bin Laden politically, but that's no reason to make  fun of his manhood.  Let's all get together and the last one to finish on a cracker can eat it.  Well, we need letterhead first if we're going to start this menu.  Yeah, and then we'll protest against South Park.  His national group of uptight C's taken.  That'd look nice on a letterhead.  They did a great little homage to Warner Brothers cartoons last night. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, that's where we're getting at.  Very funny.  Instead of going over the whole episode, go check it out yourself.  It was well, well done.  Remember that part where he hit him with the mallet?  That was awesome.  Yeah, I know.  Matt and Trey outdid themselves this time around.  Is that show still doing well in the ratings?  I think it goes in waves, that show.  You know, it'll really peak and then it kind of gets down.  I think it's in one of its little valleys.  It's still good.  It's always fun.  But then it'll do something to push it even further. 
[00:15:30]  I watch it now and just go, oh, my God, how the hell did they get away with that?  I can't get enough of Butters.  Butters is good.  I don't want the Thrax, fellas.  The Thrax.  I think we have that here.  I don't want to get the Thrax, fellas.  The Thrax.  They're all like a gas mask.  That was awesome.  Liz, what's going on?  Liz, there's something wrong with our phones.  Hello.  I haven't broke a phone system in a while and I would love to do it today.  She hung up?  Nah.  Ain't that a shame. 
[00:16:00]  All right, let's go to Caroline.  Hey, Caroline, what's up?  I don't know.  I wanted to comment on that lady's email campaign.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know, but I haven't gone out and done this a couple of times myself.  I wonder if they realize how great that makes a girl feel.  No, you're feeling something that's wrong if you feel good about wowing.  Baloney.  You have problems that they know how to fix.  Right there, you may have a bad day yourself and you see somebody with one of those stickers 
[00:16:30]  on their car and you flash it to get that big smile from them or a high five or a thumbs  up and they just give you this great double take.  It's the most wonderful thing.  You make their day, you make your day.  Makes a lot of people happy and this bitch wants to wreck it.  Yeah.  Well, she'll just make it bigger.  What?  She'll just make it bigger.  Yeah, it will get bigger.  I encourage you to send that email all over the place.  Caroline, you got problems.  You need help.  You just don't realize it.  You need a brighter left-wing woman to show you the way. 
[00:17:00]  Right, to show you what you should be doing and how you should be thinking.  You mean I should let all the hair under my arms grow out?  Amen.  Yes.  Exactly.  I hate that.  That's great.  I love when a woman's armpit looks like a 70s porno movie lap.  That's what I like.  Big, thick, hairy mess down there.  No, I like the hairless look.  It's all over.  It's way too scary. 
[00:17:30]  Remember those old magazines you'd get when you were a kid, though, and you'd open them  up and the girl's kind of sitting there with the larger 70s hips and just that huge pillow  down there.  I don't mind that sometimes.  Oh, no?  No, at times I don't.  It's a nice change.  To look at.  Change of pace?  Yeah, to put your face in it, it's a basic nightmare, but I'm just saying.  Somehow, that situation, it always makes you, lets you know how your cat feels when he's 
[00:18:00]  on the back of the couch going,  I'm going to go, guys.  I'm hitting the toes.  And then that thing just comes, all right, bye-bye.  That is great.  Nothing worse than trying to get one out of your tooth and not let, oh, don't let her  on to it, though, and you, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Are we allowed to announce our surprise guest yet? 
[00:18:30]  You don't want to go, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  David Wells is stopping by.  Yes.  David Wells.  With Hooters Girls.  Boomer.  The boomer.  Just love him.  Isn't that great?  All right, we're going to take a break.  We're just getting started today.  Well, the worst is when you've got to stop because it's not in the teeth.  It's in the back of the throat.  You just got to stop and go, excuse me.  And you're giving yourself a gag reflex when you put your finger down your throat to try 
[00:19:00]  to grab it.  Trying to get it.  The worst mistake you could ever make because it is virtually impossible.  Yeah.  And we've all tried it.  Try to swallow it.  Have you ever dropped it?  You can't do it.  It doesn't go anywhere.  What's with those hands?  Yeah.  I can't swallow it.  It's like eating fish popcorn.  Jesus.  That little kernel gets stuck in there.  Why can't I swallow it? 
[00:19:30]  I can swallow it till you have pasta.  But, Elaine, you've got to save me, Elaine.  I can't swallow.  I can't swallow.  We've got to take a break.  We might have to steal someone's radio promotion because this station was too wimpy to go through  with it.  Really?  Oh, my God.  There's a bunch of wimps in this business. 
[00:20:00]  That's true.  We'll get the details next.  Steal it.  We might have to do it.  Sure.  We might have to just do it to show them how it's done and show them how you don't back  down to management and political correctness and special interest groups.  If you have an idea on the radio, you don't have the balls to follow it through.  Right?  Right.  Right.  Ready?  Three, two, one.  Opie and Anthony.  The Robert Downey Jr. is a radio.  Right.  We can't leave anything alone.  Let's hear a mother-daughter queef over the phone. 
[00:20:30]  You pick artistic subjects.  Opie and Anthony.  Huddle of Mud Control.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, man.  In New York, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-277-4WOW.  David Wells stopping by to say hi today.  Yeah.  It's smart to come by on Thumbs Up Thursday.  Thumbs Up Thursday.  Yeah.  Margaret, what's going on?  Hi.  Hi.  I was just diving on the Meadowbrook and some lady gave me a finger for my WOW sticker. 
[00:21:00]  So we flashed her.  Oh, good.  Nice.  Gave you the finger.  Nice.  Gave me the finger.  Honestly, like, I don't think it's degrading.  Women have the choice.  Men have the choice.  Of course they do.  Of course.  Yeah.  It's all about choice.  No one's going to tell you what to do.  If you want a WOW, then you go WOW.  Exactly.  All right, Margaret.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  I'll bet the finger thing was a dyke's idea.  Hey, Greg, what's going on? 
[00:21:30]  Oh, hey.  What's up, guys?  How you doing?  I'm pretty good today.  Hey, you know, I didn't actually expect to be on the air, but since I am, let me bring  you up or let you know something.  Did you know that Lamont and Tonelli from the San Jose station out here ripped you guys  off on the WOW?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Maybe a year, a year and a half ago.  I know.  They call it Whip-A-Mount.  You know, it completely ripped you guys off.  Yeah.  I've heard of it.  The funny thing is they didn't think we would get syndicated and they're like, ah, who's  going to know?  They're on the East Coast.  We're on the West Coast.  Right.  And then we got all that national exposure and they're talking about WOW, WOW, WOW, WOW, 
[00:22:00]  WOW.  And now we're on a really, really crappy station in San Francisco, but we're on.  Yeah.  I was telling your producer, they don't even play commercials on this station.  They don't?  Yeah.  When you guys go to break, if there's even one of those penis enlargement commercials,  it's a miracle.  And then after that, it's just all music.  So instead of playing commercials, what do they do?  What kind of music?  It varies.  Sometimes it'll be country.  Sometimes it'll be rock.  Country, rock.  Oh, my God. 
[00:22:30]  Not committing to really anything.  Right.  Do I have to be the program director of the San Francisco station as well?  Well, if you're going to run Opie and Anthony, why don't you play music that goes along with  the show, that shows a little attitude?  Doesn't that make sense?  Instead of like, we're right on the edge with our radio show and then they go to country  songs when we're taking a break here in New York?  Right.  How does that possibly make sense ever?  Yeah, if you listen to this show, you're really going to be into country music, I guess. 
[00:23:00]  Well, you know, the reason why I called, I wanted to find out when Jim Brewer and Dice  are going to have that show in Las Vegas.  Actually, it's Norton and...  Yeah, it's me and Norton and...  Oh, Norton.  I'm sorry.  That's all right, bro.  We fly out.  I go out actually tomorrow and we work Saturday.  We're doing a benefit at the Stardust.  And then Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, we're at the Stardust.  Okay.  Wow.  Vegas.  All right, Greg.  Thanks for...  Okay, cool.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Take it easy.  Thanks for the update in San Francisco.  All right. 
[00:23:30]  All right.  There's the first phone call we've gotten from San Francisco in about four months, too.  Yeah.  And they're always how bad the station is and whatnot.  How there's no signal.  James, what's going on?  Not much, man.  I just wanted to say thanks for the play-by-play yesterday on that truck chase.  Oh.  You guys covered it better than any radio station did here in Dallas.  Everybody else was just talking over the news people.  You guys were just telling us what was going on.  Well, the problem with Dallas, though, you got to hear our play-by-play eight hours after 
[00:24:00]  the fact.  Yeah, but that's fine because I was on my way to work as it was happening, so it's not  like I could see it anyway.  We're on at, what, 10 to 2 over there in Dallas?  Yeah, 10 to 2.  I usually catch you guys my last couple hours at work, man.  You guys, man, you guys got me rolling on the floor over there.  Look at that.  That was a great police chase yesterday.  Yeah, it was.  I didn't like the ending.  The ending strong.  The ending could have been better.  Just like that.  I heard the guy got shot.  Did you read the book?  Yes.  It was much better in the book.  Did the guy really get shot?  I know they shot at him, but...  From what I was told by a chick that it ended, like, right in front of her store, yeah, 
[00:24:30]  they ended up shooting the guy.  No, everyone saw the police guy, you know, shoot at him.  But it ended on a highway.  Who knows, man?  Right.  And they just, like, he left the vehicle laid down on the ground.  Yeah.  They might have shot him when he was trying to go around that corner.  Saw that one.  That was good.  One of our listeners yesterday said that the ending of that police chase was as bad as a  Kevin Costner movie ending.  Yeah.  That's bad.  It was long.  You were hoping it was going to end good, and then it's just not as good as you had hoped. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, no.  He's going to hit the ball in the water seven times in a row.  Oh, I know.  Please.  It was the worst.  Tin Cup sucked.  Oh, it was awful.  What was worse, Tin Cup or Waterworld?  Waterworld is one of the worst movies ever made.  Yeah, Waterworld, definitely.  Kind of cold because of...  Tin Cup was a good movie up until the ending, and it was just completely ridiculous.  Some of the explosion is pretty good in Waterworld, I think. 
[00:25:30]  Not worth the movie.  Oof.  You know, at least that's a match.  Definitely not worth the action.  How about the one where he's the mailman?  I haven't caught that one.  Oh, the mailman, it's called.  It's called the mailman?  The postman.  Oh, the postman, right.  The postman.  What does he do, deliver anthrax?  No, he's a postman in the early 1800s or something.  No, in the future, after an apocalypse.  Oh, Christ.  And he decides that the best way to bring the country back together is show that the government,  he keeps going around like spreading these rumors that the government is back together 
[00:26:00]  and everything's fine, and they're starting off by getting the postal system back because  he found a postal uniform and some mail, and he goes and delivers it.  And all of a sudden, all these branches of the post office start popping up.  Sounds action-packed.  Yeah.  Real captivating idea.  Post office.  Yeah.  And they continue to give him movies, so maybe they could have done something better and  actually had HUD, different divisions of the housing and urban development.  Oh, I'm getting goosebumps thinking about it.  I like Costa, though.  He's done some good movies. 
[00:26:30]  No Way Out was phenomenal.  Kevin Costner.  Perfect World was good.  Mm-hmm.  And he's done some...  3,000 Miles to Graceland.  Wait, do you like Perfect World?  I love that, man.  That was pretty good.  I really like that.  I'll give him that.  That was pretty good.  Philip.  And then the other one, 3,000 Miles to Graceland.  That was pretty good.  Pretty violent.  I like it.  All right, James.  Thank you.  All right, thanks, man.  Send us some wild stickers.  No.  No.  Well, send us a self-adjusted stamp envelope, and we'll send you stickers, all right?  Hello.  Peggy, what's up?  Hi, what's up?  I hear you're a crazy old broad. 
[00:27:00]  I'm sorry.  I hear you're a crazy old broad.  Yeah, that's me.  What's up?  Sounds like Gary, the 11-year-old.  I wanted to tell you something.  Okay.  I saw you guys on...  I know it was a remun, because my daughter had seen it before.  I don't know, one of those E radio shows.  You know where they interviewed you guys?  Really?  You know, they showed you both.  2020.  I had you totally pictured different from your voices. 
[00:27:30]  2020 downtown, maybe?  Yeah, that's it.  Yeah, okay.  And...  When did that air?  Oh, a long time ago.  Oh, okay.  I showed the repeat, so I don't know in the original.  Wrong.  And, uh, all right, so...  And I flipped out.  I had a total picture by your voices, what you looked like.  Well, I got a picture of you from your voice, Peggy.  Yeah, I do, too.  It's nice.  And what is that picture?  No, no, I like your voice.  What are you, 50?  Yeah, unfortunately. 
[00:28:00]  Why is 50 bad?  Are you a rough...  Well, because when I turned 50, everybody started sending me AARP things and...  Are you a hard 50 or...  I'm a divorced woman.  Are you a hard 50, though, where you look like you're older than 50?  No, I'm, uh, 4-11, uh, 1-0-8.  Nice.  And where do you live there, Peggy?  In Massapequa.  Massapequa?  Massapequa. 
[00:28:30]  Is there a thought that goes along with this, uh, phone call?  Just to tell you, you know, I think you guys are fabulous.  Thank you, Peggy.  Do you wow there, Peggy?  Huh?  Do you wow?  I haven't gotten the nerve up yet.  When you do wow, do you have to lift your pant leg?  No, come on, you know, I didn't get out there both.  Uh, yeah, I wowed with my daughter.  Oh.  Nice. 
[00:29:00]  Still married there, Peggy?  Am I still married?  Yeah.  No.  What happened?  He's a scumbag.  What happened?  He's a scumbag.  Oh, he's a scumbag, yeah.  Scumbag.  Yeah.  What did he do to you?  Screwed me over.  You were screwing somebody else?  Mm, how about, uh, drugs and women and, uh...  It sounds like you might do a little, uh, drugging yourself there, Peggy.  I have.  Oh, yeah?  In the past.  What was your drug of choice, Peg? 
[00:29:30]  Of the past?  Yeah.  Uh, coke weed.  Yeah, you sound like a coke girl to me.  But years ago.  Oh, yeah?  I was a hippie-dippie, you know.  Hippies didn't do coke.  It was like the disco days of the 70s.  Um, you know, I just...  Did you ever suck your way into Studio 54?  No.  Not that old.  Peggy, you sound like you're on something right now.  50.  I'm not on anything right now.  I love your show.  I've been trying to get through all the time.  I never get through. 
[00:30:00]  All I do is hear you talk to other people.  Well...  That's called a radio show.  That's...  I know.  Well, in the 70s, I met a radio guy.  Oh, yeah?  And did things I shouldn't have done.  And what?  Did things I shouldn't have done.  Well, you did things?  You think you shouldn't have done.  Where?  And who?  He worked in New York.  Who was it?  I can't say, because if I say the name...  Statute of Limitations, it's fine.  The weird...  He has a very strange name.  Even my daughter laughed when I eventually told her the story. 
[00:30:30]  Cousin Brucie.  No, no, no.  Scott Muni.  Wolfman Jack.  No.  Wolfman Jack?  It's a weird, weird...  It rhymes.  Give us the initials.  It rhymes, she said.  It rhymes?  Yeah.  O.P.  O.P.?  No, who was it?  O.P.  That's the initials?  That's the initials.  Not O.P.  O.P.  O.P.  Was he a big jock in New York?  Well, at the time, I can't even think what he was on. 
[00:31:00]  ABC?  Ocean Pacific?  Yeah, I'm trying to think.  Oh, oh, uh-oh.  Oh, I met him at the mall with my girlfriend, and...  And then he took you out to the parking lot?  Oh, motel room.  Hey, hey, we're going to go to a motel room.  I was 70s boss.  No, and then visit the house.  Hey, hey, Peggy, pull down your pants.  After the shift.  Peggy, was it Otto Peterson?  No.  Who could it have been?  O.P.  O.P.  Someone will come up with it. 
[00:31:30]  Very old.  I mean, he wasn't old to me at the time.  He wasn't...  He was older than me.  I was only like, you know...  So he talked you into going to the motel?  Well, he gave me, like, the private line, you know, calling the night.  Yeah, the hotline, yeah.  I had just gotten my first divorce.  Oh, jeez.  So I was really young.  Was it Orlando Pace?  No.  I don't know.  Tony Pig?  No.  Everybody is sending just me.  The second name is the name of a food. 
[00:32:00]  A snack.  Pear.  Peach.  Potato.  Potato chip.  Pecan.  Otto Kreminger.  Parenteau.  It's in a red can.  It's in a red can.  A red can?  P in a red can?  Well, not P in a red can.  No, it's the letter P.  That's what I said.  P in a red can.  And it's in a red can.  It's a red can.  It's in a pink.  Pringle?  Pringle?  Pringle?  Whose last name was Pringle in New York? 
[00:32:30]  Whose first name rhymed with that?  Where's Earl?  Earl knows this crap.  Yeah, Earl would know this.  Last name Pringle.  First name starts with an O.  I think this guy was joshing you.  Yeah.  And he...  He was on every night.  He brought you into a motel room and he banged you.  Well, maybe everybody.  He just looked at a big Pringle's can.  You know.  He calls it the Pringle can.  I hung out for a while.  But, uh, you know, sorry.  Did your friend go with you?  Was it a little threesome?  Yeah. 
[00:33:00]  Oh!  Look at you, Peggy, the goer.  Me and my girlfriend went and...  Yeah.  We got the ugly one and...  Once Pringle pops, you can't stop.  Isn't that this little slogan, this big round long can?  Very good one.  Very good one.  Peggy, do you wear thongs at 50?  At 50?  Do you wear thongs?  Yeah.  Nice.  How do you know?  I'm just asking.  How about, uh, what?  Oogie?  Was it Oogie Pringle? 
[00:33:30]  Sing me, me, me, me, me, me, me.  Oh.  How the hell does Dan from Hoboken know that?  Dan knows everything.  Look at E-A-F from New York saying it was Orenthal J. Pringle.  I mean, this guy got lost from the city to Long Island.  Well, all right, Earl, who was Oogie Pringle in New York radio?  Never heard of him.  You've never heard of Oogie Pringle?  Oh, come on.  Peggy, what station did he work for?  I thought ABC, but I could be mistaken.  It was a very long time, but I thought it was ABC. 
[00:34:00]  All right, well, uh...  Oogie...  77?  At this point, we should say this is what, uh, Peggy alleges happened with Oogie Pringle.  I don't even...  I think Oogie would be happy to even have his name.  Yeah, actually, I'd never let him out on the screen.  I am looking right now, rock and roll, uh, rock radio scrapbook, WNBC lineups.  We have, uh, Cousin Brucie, Al Brady, Bob Vernon, and, uh, what I'm looking at, 8 p.m. to 12...  That was his call name.  I don't know what his real name was. 
[00:34:30]  8 p.m. to 12 midnight, Oogie Pringle.  Oogie Pringle?  Oogie Pringle is on NBC.  Do you have a picture of Oogie Pringle?  I could dare to dream.  They don't have a picture of Oogie Pringle on the website.  When was he there?  I'm looking through all of the, uh...  What year did you say this was?  Uh, many, many years ago.  I get...  Oh, he was there, um, let's see, 1974.  At NBC?  At NBC.  Don Imus in the morning, and Cousin Brucie, Al Brady, Bob Vernon, and then 8 p.m. 
[00:35:00]  to midnight, your own Oogie Pringle.  I played 70, 71.  And then Dick Summer and Bill Rock on the weekends.  So, allegedly, Peggy had some fun with Oogie.  Oogie Pringle.  Oogie.  Where is Oogie Pringle these days?  Uh, he probably did.  Then Oogie got moved down in 76 to 6 to 10 on WMBC.  Yeah, and he gave me a private line.  By 77, Oogie was gone.  And then he'd go into commercial and solve, and then he'd come back, and, you know, he  had his cronies around him like you guys do. 
[00:35:30]  Oogie.  They'd make him fun, and, um...  Peg, can I interrupt you and ask you a question?  Do you have a, do you have a wood floor?  I can't hear you.  Do you have a wood floor, Peg?  A wood floor?  Yeah.  You keep all nice down there?  Well, where I lived then, yes, I had a wood floor.  No, I'm saying now, do you, do you upkeep, like, do you know what I'm talking about?  No.  Like, if I take off the diaper, would there be...  Oh, come on. 
[00:36:00]  All right, uh, Crazy Paul's on the line.  He knows who Oogie Pringle is.  All right, Crazy Paul.  Yeah, well, first of all, listen to the sound of my voice.  It sounds like she's swung a little too much Oogie over the years.  Anyway, um, I think he used to be, like, one of the MCA good guys,  and then he was, like, a substitute weekend guy on ABC,  like, with all them Echo guys way back when.  Yeah, I talked to him on the weekend, someone, like, weeknights,  like, Thursday night, he'd travel out from the city.  Yeah, he was a substitute guy.  I mean, now I think he's nothing of it.  I was not.  He could have been a serial killer. 
[00:36:30]  Well, no, he was Oogie Pringle.  Yeah, who's going to be...  Oogie Pringle's not a serial killer.  No, the name probably couldn't do it for me.  Oogie wouldn't have hurt you.  All right, so you were having some fun with Oogie.  But him and his buddy wanted to get in on the motel,  and we were like, no, no, no, no, no.  What, Oogie with another guy and you?  Well, it was Oogie, another guy, and my girlfriend.  Oh, so it was two on two there.  Right.  Oogie had a friend with him?  Yeah, he wanted to get us drunk.  All right, Oogie.  And how old were you at the time, Peg? 
[00:37:00]  Okay, I was 70, so, or 71, so I was about...  Oh, man, that's 30 years.  19, 20?  Yeah, you were about 20, 19, right, okay.  So, I was...  And was he a lot older than you back then?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Going for the young girls, getting them all drunk and stuff?  I think I was into the old, you know, like, even though he was in the store,  that I could hear his voice in the radio type thing.  Yeah.  Back in those days, a roofie was just slamming somebody in the forehead with a hammer. 
[00:37:30]  It wasn't his hammer, he was sliding.  Nice.  A lot of people are checking in, and they've heard of Oogie.  Well, I need a picture of Oogie.  I have no clue.  Oh, someone...  Somebody's got it.  We'll find a picture of Oogie.  Someone will dig up a picture of Oogie Pringle.  Hey, Peggy, I've got to be careful with this.  Was Oogie a shwoogie?  Was Oogie a...  I didn't hear the last word. 
[00:38:00]  Was Oogie a shwoogie?  Oogie a shwoogie.  No.  You lost me.  I'm too old, I guess.  Was he a black guy?  No, no.  No?  An Italian guy?  What was he?  He was very like Opie.  I got the hots for Opie.  Oh, great.  So he was...  Another old broad guy who's got the hots for me.  Opie's cute, isn't he, Peg?  Shut up, Morton.  Opie is adorable. 
[00:38:30]  That's what I was trying to say.  Opie isn't my time.  I go for Anthony.  There you go.  The rock here, the mustache, the voice.  That's good.  I'm going to live in a cave and shave.  Hey, I just...  Hey, Peggy, you want to come down and check out the show?  I think I'm too old for you.  No.  You're not going to...  We're not bringing you to a motel.  Who do you think we are?  Oogie?  Hey, I'll be ready.  What was the last name?  I haven't had it in years. 
[00:39:00]  I was going to ask.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's horrible.  I've given it.  What?  I've given things.  All right.  You've given some stuff.  Good girl, Peg.  But you haven't received.  I had to go to court and admit I did these things.  Wait a minute.  Okay.  Hold on.  Peggy, you're saying...  Well, who are these guys...  Please change my name.  Oh, yeah.  We're not talking about Peggy.  Please, my daughter's listening.  Who are these guys that you're servicing?  Coming in. 
[00:39:30]  And then not giving you your own satisfaction?  Well, one's my ex.  And one's...  If I don't feel like doing it, I feel I should give them some pleasure.  Good girl.  That's the old story.  But why do you have to go to court?  To say that I did these things and I was forced to do these things.  And, you know, I had a...  He had a female lawyer, so she was a real bitch. 
[00:40:00]  Wow, you've lost me.  You know, she was like, well, didn't you go in the backyard naked and do it?  With who?  My husband.  So what's wrong with that?  This was...  Well, to her, that was, you know...  This all came up in the divorce case.  Right.  So what's the problem with having sex with your husband?  Yeah.  Nothing.  That I went outside.  Naked.  Just questioning your character or your ability to parent? 
[00:40:30]  Supposedly.  What's wrong with going outside naked in your own backyard?  Yeah.  Nothing to me.  I was kind of embarrassed that the neighbors would see.  Oh, so they were trying to make it seem like you were some kind of pervert.  Yeah, that was my idea.  It wasn't his.  So the neighbors obviously caught you guys having sex with your character?  No, no, they didn't.  No.  He told the lawyer and then the lawyer used it against me.  Oh.  Ah, I see.  Ah, that old gag.  Looks like...  And, you know...  Hey, when was the last time you gave a little? 
[00:41:00]  Gave a little?  Yeah.  Ah, what month are we in?  November?  Yeah.  Yeah, are you talking me give without...  Yeah, you give.  Yeah, you give without getting anything back.  Um...  April?  April.  No, no, no, I'm sorry.  Yeah, April.  Who was it?  Not the name, but you're just a friend or, you know, what? 
[00:41:30]  No, he hates, he wishes I would die.  The person you gave this treat to wishes you would die?  Yeah.  You're that bad, huh?  Yeah.  Well, I had collapsed one day, and he came in and found me and said, if it wasn't for  the kids, I'd leave you here to die.  Really?  Yeah, I see.  And was it a neighbor or something?  Jesus.  Norton's got a rod.  Oh, God.  Why are you showing me your rod?  Oh, this is making him hot. 
[00:42:00]  You're a sick, twisted F.  Well, he thinks he's God's gift to women.  He thinks walking across the living room naked, just as, oh, my God, I want your body.  He doesn't realize, you know.  And this is a friend of yours?  No, it's my ex.  Oh, the ex came...  This is when we were living in the same house, but in different parts of the house.  Okay, so you gave him a hummer one time.  Yeah, to the point, you know, I'd go in the shower.  Yeah?  And, oh, I'd have to go to the bathroom, to put it lightly, can I say pee? 
[00:42:30]  Yes, you can.  And he'd be standing there naked, taking care of himself.  Ah, there you go.  In the bathroom?  Yeah, and I'd say, I need the bathroom, and he'd say, go ahead.  Ah.  What a classic.  Norton is loving this guy.  And I go in, and I turn around, and he's on the inside of the door.  He's just looking at you, trying to scrap?  Good boy.  Well, not crap, but... 
[00:43:00]  No, no, no, scrap, not crap.  Oh.  All right, so he stays in the bathroom while you're trying to use it.  He's on the inside, and he's like, excuse me, you spoke to me on the outside.  Right.  He was real sweet on.  Peg, can I ask this?  Did you ever catch him looking at you and not slowing down his arm movement while you were making tingle?  Did I make arm movement?  Yeah.  No.  All right.  And this is, uh...  I love you, and I love him. 
[00:43:30]  You rule.  I did everything...  Did you like it?  ...that I couldn't make impossible.  Did you like the, uh, the, uh, the...  The only thing I couldn't do is because he's very large.  All right, well, I don't know if they dumped out, but, uh, Peggy gave the yellow discipline to her ex.  How about that?  I love this guy for asking me.  Peggy, you're going to have to come in.  Are you still a goer, or what?  You look good?  Um, I'd say decent. 
[00:44:00]  You know, I mean, I wouldn't sound dear to you, but I'm not, you know, you wouldn't work for it.  Yeah, yeah, we could get you a banging or something, if you like.  Yeah.  One of our sick listeners will do you.  Certainly will.  Um, I wear the picket.  I'd rather do Opie.  I know he's got a girlfriend.  Ugh.  Yeah, I'll be a good guy.  No, that's all right.  That's how you keep listeners happy.  Right.  It's all about...  I mean, Anthony, you, you look like my ex. 
[00:44:30]  Great.  Good.  But you've really turned me on.  I would do that.  I would, uh, stand there while you, uh, do your business and take care of myself.  A lot of...  A lot of people...  Well, his thing was, do it on me.  Oh, I love this guy.  Oh, my God.  How about this?  Since Anthony looks like your ex and I behave like him, why don't the three of us hang out?  And you could just yellow discipline on me and stare at Anthony.  And I'll take the pictures.  So Norton can have them. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, but see, I'd want to do it with you.  And Ben can stand here and just tell you to jump in front of a bus and die.  I mean, I want to get something out of it.  Peggy, hold on a sec, okay?  Yeah, please call me a different name.  All right.  This is Anne.  Uh, yeah, whatever your name is.  Uh, a lot of people are saying that Oogie killed himself.  Yes, I'm getting reports now that Oogie Pringle in 1987 killed himself.  Uh...  It was probably after me.  He never had it to, but...  Did you know that Oogie killed himself, Peggy?  No, I didn't. 
[00:45:30]  How do you feel, uh, now knowing that perhaps Oogie, uh, killed himself?  It doesn't bother me, to be honest.  I mean, I feel sad, but...  Yeah.  I know a lot of people that killed themselves, and, you know...  You do?  Gee, who's a common denominator, though?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, it wasn't because of me.  It was probably because of his liver.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why, uh, Oogie liked, uh...  Uh, sexually transmitted disease. 
[00:46:00]  And at that time...  Believe me, that doesn't cause suicide.  It wasn't, you know...  You don't want to get the AIDS, fellas.  Yeah.  Who had the STD?  You ever have it, uh...  No, I never had it.  Anne.  Been clean all my life.  And Peg.  Well, uh, Peggy, we're going to have to...  I even actually met him at the door in a...  A naked...  That's how I introduced when he came to my house.  Oh, ho, Oogie or the ex?  Oogie.  Oogie.  So, Oogie came to your house, and you met him at the door naked? 
[00:46:30]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  In a little tiny thong.  How long...  How many times did Oogie do you?  And a deep top.  And a what top?  A top.  I can't believe I did that.  How many times did Oogie do you?  Uh, about three.  Here it is.  And he actually called me from the parkway.  He couldn't find where he was going.  I really liked Oogie.  Oogie was, uh, working, I guess, at K-Wiz.  I mean, and he could have seen his eyes when I answered the door.  I can't believe I did it myself to this day. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, so, uh, you were pretty much naked for Oogie when he, uh, knocked on the door.  Yeah, I mean, no one meets you at the door like that that you don't know.  Well, when Oogie Pringle comes a-calling.  I'm reading this right now.  It says, Oogie was at K-Wiz.  I don't know where that is.  K-W-I-Z.  No, thank God.  From 1985 to 87.  And it says, Oogie committed suicide in 1987.  Wow.  So, Oogie, Pringle, uh, boy, we hardly knew ye.  We hardly knew ye. 
[00:47:30]  Because I'm sure I'm not the only one.  All right.  Well, Peggy, you got some wonderful stories.  Wonderful.  Okay.  I love, I love, I love your show.  I'm never, uh, having sex with, uh, Peggy Ann over here.  You can look at what happened to Oogie.  I know.  Killed himself.  I, I, truthfully, I think you're both very, very attractive.  He searched the world.  The comment I was making is that Oogie, Oogie, Oogie, Oogie, is not the guy I'm attracted to. 
[00:48:00]  I'm not attracted to a, uh, you know, fair-haired guy.  Right.  And my daughter's turned on by him.  Well, I'll, I'll bang your daughter and, uh.  Sure, the 20-year-old.  She's going to be 21.  That's perfect.  So, once you bring her by, I'll do her and Norton will do you.  Yeah, you'd like her.  She, she's a D cup.  Does she look like Oogie?  Why don't you guys come by?  Yeah, why don't you come by for a little bit?  I'm not a D, I'm only a B.  It's fine. 
[00:48:30]  That's all right, Peggy.  We like the small ones, too.  They, they don't, uh, they, they, they, they're still sitting nice, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, thank God you didn't have the Ds.  Look where they would be today.  They'd be hanging on my knees.  That's right.  Okay.  There's a drink called the Oogie Pringle.  Yeah.  It's, uh, one and a half ounces of light rum, uh, two ounces of cranberry juice, two  ounces of pineapple juice, combined ingredients with ice and stir.  And it's called the Oogie Pringle.  And it comes with a side of shotgun.  I don't need a shotgun. 
[00:49:00]  All right.  All right.  I just made a couple drinks and a little sweet talk and I'm ready.  I didn't want you to talk.  I'm ready.  All right.  You talk dirty there, Peg?  Yeah.  You know what?  Hold on.  We're going to have you talk dirty next, okay?  Wait, wait, wait.  So you got a few minutes to practice and get ready, okay?  I don't know what you want me to say.  Get ready, Ann.  Uh, Rick will go, Rick will talk to you.  We'll get you talking dirty.  Turn on all the guys out there.  There's a few of them that want to bang you.  They say, I'll definitely bang this old broad.  There's Rich on Line 4.  Stop calling me no broad. 
[00:49:30]  And we'll, uh, look, uh, Justin on the national line, I'll bang this chick.  Oh, this lady is awesome.  That's JJ.  She's 50 years young.  Hey, there you go.  Uh, James, James, I'm never going to look at my grandma the same way again.  So we're getting some good comments about you.  Yeah.  Peggy?  Yeah.  All right, hold on.  We're going to, uh, have you talk dirty to everyone next.  All right?  All right.  And we're going to have you...  I hope my daughter's not listening.  No.  Don't worry about it.  No, not at all.  No, she's...  Hopefully she's in school right now. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, she's probably listening to Britney Spears on another radio station.  No, no, she's not into that.  And, uh, Peggy, we're going to have you come down here, and it'll be up to you.  If you want to get banged, we'll get you a banging.  Do I have to get banged?  No.  Can I just come down and see what happens?  Yeah, you can just come down.  Yeah, you can just come down.  With my daughter?  With your daughter.  As long as you're dressed sexy.  Make believe we're Oogie.  Oogie Pringle.  Well, really...  I don't want to make Oogie Pringle.  We'll reenact the Oogie Pringle knocking on your door, and you'll open it, and we'll see what happens. 
[00:50:30]  I think you guys are the sexiest guys on the radio.  There you go.  Well, there you go.  Yeah, now that Oogie's dead.  No, I'm serious.  That's a wonderful interview.  I listen to...  He just turns me off.  Oh, well, there you go.  All right.  Hey, Peggy.  You guys are cute.  I mean, actually cute.  All right, Peggy, hold on.  Anthony's cute.  All right, hold on the line.  She'll talk forever.  That's Peggy.  I think we found a new character for the Opie and Anthony show.  Jeez.  Old broad Peggy. 
[00:51:00]  But I don't like the way she's just coming around to you guys now that Oogie took the  dirt nap.  Well, Oogie took the dirt nap quite a while ago.  Poor Oogie's been dead for 15 years, and we're talking about him on the radio.  Bye-bye in the box.  Oogie Pringle.  All right.  We're going to have Peggy talk dirty next.  Great.  Just stick around.  And also, David Wells should be here in moments with the Hooters girls.  You guys have redefined debauchery.  It's like a vaudeville show on acid. 
[00:51:30]  Opie Anthony.  P.O.D.  Alive.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  David Wells will be here in a second.  We've got to go to Jody really fast, though.  Jody, what's up?  Hi.  I'm the one who wrote the email.  Are you honestly really the one?  Honestly, God.  Yes.  I'm sorry that I offended everybody.  I'm getting these nasty I.M.  What is the last four letters of your email address? 
[00:52:00]  O-D-I-O-S.  That's more than four.  O-D-I-O-S?  Yes.  All right.  All right.  Let me read your stupid email, in my opinion.  Okay.  Wow.  This was a great promotional idea up until they began distributing stickers to the ugliest of men around.  Any man who has to stick a sticker in their car and pray that somebody flashes them is gross.  What's the matter?  Can't get any at home?  Well, for all those women who are bored and disgusted with this promotion, read on.  I'm encouraging all of you to participate in WOW by whipping out your middle finger. 
[00:52:30]  Whip out your middle finger not only on Wednesdays, but every day of the week.  Wow guys are gross.  Let's show them how gross they are.  Whip out your middle finger.  Forward this email to all men and women.  When men see that we think they are ugly and the only thing they are going to get is the middle finger,  Opie and Anthony will have to come up with some other promotional idea that is not degrading to women.  How about D-O-T?  D on Tuesday.  I just added that.  Thank you for listening.  What's your problem? 
[00:53:00]  My problem is, okay, I tried to call into ONA.  These guys are ugly.  Who?  These guys with the WOW stickers, they're all butt ugly.  Every single guy that has a WOW sticker on their car is butt ugly.  Every single one.  You've seen everybody.  I gave the middle finger to some guy yesterday.  Right.  And it turned out he was a cop.  But he was ugly.  That's so stupid to say every guy out there is ugly.  Well, it's just, it's sickening.  It's degrading.  It's not degrading to women, but it's...  Why did it say it's degrading to women?  It's, well, it's just, it's not right. 
[00:53:30]  So you think you're going to accomplish something with your email?  I already did.  How?  I've gotten very nasty emails.  People seem to be mad.  Yeah, but see, they're...  I mean, I'm not looking to get people mad, but I'm getting people to listen to me.  No, they're rallying around the Opie and Anthony show and the whole WOW concept,  and you're just going to make it bigger.  Don't you understand that?  I got an email today from some man who listens to your show every day.  Right.  And he says that the girls that do it are nasty. 
[00:54:00]  He's flirting with you.  He wants to bang you.  Right.  Don't you get it?  Yeah, I'm engaged.  Not interested.  It doesn't matter.  That's why he wrote you back.  In fact, my fiance has a sticker.  Right.  His name is John.  Right.  And I made him throw it away.  And he's like, you're right.  You're making your man throw away his WOW sticker?  Just castrate him.  Oh, my God.  Me and my friend Lori came up with this idea and...  Hold on.  Hold on.  Jody, you know how pathetic that is to make your man do something? 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  I didn't make him.  Okay, I asked him.  What kind of marriage do you think you're going to have?  Typical.  I asked him.  And he's a pussy for, like, saying, okay, dear.  No.  Hey, Jody, when there's a rated R movie on, if there are boobs on the screen,  do you make him close his eyes and think of you?  Why are you asking girls to whip him out on Wednesday?  Why do you have to ask girls to do that?  Because it's a great promotion.  It brings a lot of joy. 
[00:55:00]  What's the matter?  They can't get it at home?  That's not what it's about.  Well, I mean, clearly.  No, in some cases, it's about that, sure.  But it's fun to see someone else's breasts.  Okay.  Simple as that.  Those girls are nasty.  Jody, I have a question for you.  Oh, the girls are nasty.  The guys that do it are ugly.  Well, yeah.  The guys are ugly.  Jody, you and your fiancé were being sexually active.  Am I correct?  At one point, right?  You were having sex, but he had a sticker.  So does that mean he wasn't getting it at home?  Yeah. 
[00:55:30]  Wishing you loved him.  Jody?  He was...  He had them before I got...  Is he ugly?  No, he's not ugly.  Okay, so how come only ugly guys have wow stickers?  That's why he threw it away.  Why did he have it to begin with?  Because he realized he wasn't ugly.  Oh, right.  Jody, all I have to say is, you know, thank you, because, you know, it can't hurt to advertise  Opie and Anthony in wow.  Mm-hmm.  Even if it's bad advertising.  This email is going to go all over the country, and you know what?  You're just going to make it bigger, because people are going to read this and go, wait,  who are these Opie and Anthony guys?  Wait, I think they're on one of those stations in my city, and they... 
[00:56:00]  Oh, wow.  This wow thing sounds interesting.  I'm going to give it a try.  They're going to give it a try by raising their middle finger.  No, they're not.  Yes, they will.  Sorry.  I already started today.  I listen to you guys all the time.  I think you guys are hilarious, but on Wednesdays...  Jody, shut up.  I could care less if you think we're funny.  I don't think you're funny.  I listen to you guys all the time.  I didn't say you were funny.  You just said they were hilarious.  You just said we're funny.  You just said, I think you're hilarious.  You really are an inconsistent ass.  I think you guys are great.  Shut up.  You're schizophrenic.  Arguing with a brick wall right here. 
[00:56:30]  And she's not sincere.  You're speaking to a brick wall.  Jody, I've already received this email about 10 or 12 times.  Everyone's receiving it.  You're just spreading our names around, so I want to thank you.  Ignorance.  No problem.  Even bad advertising is good for our radio show, so keep it up.  Give it a little finger, girls.  Why?  Do you not have nice breasts?  That is none of your business.  Right.  Like a couple of fried eggs.  You will never see them because I will not degrade myself to show them to anybody.  That's what it is.  Oh, God bless Jody. 
[00:57:00]  God bless Jody.  At least there are some decent people left in this world.  That temple of a body.  Decent people.  Don't be afraid on the World Trade Center crisis.  The big pile of garbage.  Of seeing women's boobs.  Jody, you don't even know what we've been doing with the whole 9-11 thing, so shut your  trap.  I don't know why we're even dealing with those women.  They're nice.  They probably look like two yarmulkes full of mud.  She just hung up.  She just hung up.  God, little brat.  Slit.  Hey, can we get David Wells in here?  He's a very busy man.  Yeah, why the hell were we even bothering with her when David Wells is here? 
[00:57:30]  Jesus Christ.  We're talking to that woman, whatever the hell she was talking about.  She had a banger or something.  I don't know what was going on.  She has a problem with us or something.  I don't even know.  Hey, David, we're all excited to meet you today.  I zoned out.  Wait a second.  But can we bring the women in?  Whoa.  Can we have something to look at?  Whoa.  Wow.  Here's my wife right here.  Yeah.  For tonight?  No, forever.  Forever.  That would be great if during the game, you know how they go to the play as wives sometimes 
[00:58:00]  and you just bring her with you.  Perfect.  Bring a different one every night.  If you want to piss somebody off, bring her with you.  We've got to set this up.  David Wells is right downstairs at Hooters.  What are you doing?  Signing stuff?  Yeah.  What?  A calendar girl signing and photo ops.  Thank you, Rhett.  David's actually the centerfold this year.  Well, shwing, boing, dung.  I want to start by applauding Hooters.  They brought in the girls from Florida to help out the restaurant. 
[00:58:30]  Hey, wait, wait.  Chicago.  I'm not from Florida.  Well, you guys.  Whatever.  You guys came from all over the country.  That's right.  It was obvious that the restaurant downstairs was hurting and they brought in the pros.  It is like a beautiful woman potpourri in here, isn't it?  Oh, it smells so much nicer in here than if they're just disgusting men.  Nah, Bob just farted, so.  Well, I got to tell you.  Well, there's 72 degrees.  It smells nice.  Oh, Bob.  It smells great.  We've heard rumors that they're bringing the hottest girls from all over the country 
[00:59:00]  to help out the Hooters downstairs.  Is that true, right?  And they put you up in a little apartment for like 30 days or so and then they send you  back home, right?  You see?  He knows.  Doesn't he look like Mark McGuire?  The undernourished Mark McGuire.  The undernourished Mark McGuire.  My brother looks just like him.  Really?  And he's a steroid.  Well, he's not a steroid freak, but he's a big boy like McGuire.  He's the natural creaking kind of guy, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a little natural.  So how's the back?  We've got to ask the questions everyone has asked you. 
[00:59:30]  Fire away.  The back is doing fine.  Right.  It's a lot better than the last couple of days there.  And the paper's going crazy here in New York.  Yeah.  Is Steinbrenner going to get you back or what?  I hope so.  It'd be nice.  Oh, yeah.  With that rock.  Just tell me the Mets are calling you too, please.  They haven't said anything.  So of course not.  That would be cute, though.  It's a part-time gig, maybe.  Yeah.  Play with them.  I'll go back and forth.  Why not?  For fun, you play with the Mets.  That's what it's all about.  That's what the Mets are all about, right? 
[01:00:00]  The Mets need more help than the Yankees.  Come on.  What?  Right there, Ope.  That's what the Mets are all about.  I have fun.  Well, remember, if you read the paper today, they got all the guys that they got rid of  wanting to come back.  So there must be something to say about New York.  Well, it's happening.  Steinbrenner's firing everybody, though.  Yeah, Steinbrenner's getting a little pissed off.  He's firing the batting coach and the bullpen coach.  He's getting a little angry that the Yankees didn't get the...  You should hire over here, because he's got a lot of money.  I'm sure these girls can use a lot of money.  Look at the clothes, man. 
[01:00:30]  It's expensive stuff.  What'd you think of the Yankee performance?  It was great.  It was great for baseball.  Wasn't it a great series to watch?  Yeah.  It's a shame they came out on the low end there.  No, it wasn't a shame at all.  Oh, stop it.  It certainly was.  I didn't like watching that parade in Arizona.  What did the Mets do, huh?  I know.  That's right.  That is exactly right.  Why am I dealing with this today?  I just don't like that, watching that parade they had there in Arizona. 
[01:01:00]  They're all on the fire trucks, taking them down the street.  I was so pissed off.  What do you want them to do?  You lose something like that.  You know something?  Nothing.  Sit there and count your blessings that you won.  Sit at home.  They should have had a party at like a Scores or something, you know?  Yeah, something a little more hardcore.  That's right.  Bastards.  You must have partied your ass off, right?  When?  Well, you know.  What night?  I mean, when you're, you know, when you're the perfect game, let's say.  Yeah, it was hard. 
[01:01:30]  You must have been some night after that.  For about a week.  Yeah.  Into my next start, so.  Let's just say, you know, the way the press portrays you, you like to party a little bit.  There's nothing wrong with it.  Absolutely.  I'm right there.  It's controlled partying, so.  Yeah.  What the hell?  We're not getting out of hand, as far as I know.  The most amazing thing was that, didn't you go seventh inning, one out, into a second perfect game?  And I think it was Giambi that hit.  Was it Jason Giambi or Stairs that got to hit Oakland?  I don't know.  Look at that. 
[01:02:00]  See?  He doesn't even know.  No, that's a long time ago, man.  He doesn't care anymore.  He almost pitched two perfect games a lot.  Yeah, you don't remember the almost perfect games.  That's right.  So how close is Steinbrenner to signing you?  Yeah.  Come on.  I don't know.  I haven't even heard from him, so.  He's got it.  Go on.  Just keep putting these in the paper, man.  It's going to make them die.  You want to come back to New York so bad, don't you?  It would be my first choice.  Obviously.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What if the Yankees said no and the Mets said, come on?  I don't know.  I'd probably come.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, stop, man.  As long as you're in New York. 
[01:02:30]  As long as you're in New York, that's.  Yeah.  I'm telling you, this is a great place to be.  What do you like about New York that you don't like about the other cities?  You see right here?  The talent?  Hi.  The talent, right?  No, it just has a lot to offer.  I mean, hell, you don't even have to go outside your apartment.  You can order McDonald's if you want.  They bring it right up, so.  That's the best thing about it.  Good hangover, man.  I'll take a couple of cheeseburgers.  The delivery McDonald's.  Yeah.  That would be the delivery McDonald's.  Maybe you could walk down the stairs for the McDonald's.  What do you like about New York?  I like everything about New York. 
[01:03:00]  I love the people, and I don't know.  It's just a fun town to party in, right, Dave?  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  Bars open until four.  Aren't you guys jealous?  I bet.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Do you want to know?  All right.  You've got these hot ladies from Hooters.  This is what we've got today.  Peggy.  Yeah.  Say hi to David Wells.  Hi, David.  Hi.  She's 50 years old, and she used to bang a guy named...  Oogie Pringle.  Oogie Pringle.  He's Oogie Pringle.  See, all these ladies want David Wells. 
[01:03:30]  This is the Peggy.  She's 50 years old.  She wants us.  David.  Perfect.  That's what we get.  We're happening, too.  You've got to be versatile.  Isn't that great?  She's got a really sexy voice.  Well, she was going to talk dirty for us.  Well, let's do it.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Oh, she's spunky.  Yeah.  One of the Hooters girls was putting you down, Peggy.  Yeah.  Oh, I said you had a sexy voice.  Yeah, didn't you sound a little sarcastic?  Ooh.  Oh, Peggy.  As far as you know. 
[01:04:00]  Well, Peggy.  Peggy, if you see what's on the other end of this, you would be honored.  Yeah.  Peggy, these girls are more than half your age.  I know, and I admire them.  I think they're, you know, great looking.  Thank you, Peggy.  I bet you feel bad now saying she had a sexy voice.  Hey, I know there's no sarcasm involved.  All right, Peggy, you're going to talk.  Hey, if they can give all those men those girls, give more power to them.  All right, Peggy, you're going to talk dirty for us a little later, right?  Well, yeah, I guess so, from what he said. 
[01:04:30]  With pleasure.  All right.  Hey, Dave, you need a beer or anything?  No, I'm good.  I'm real good.  He's talking to Peggy.  John.  I'm sending her subliminal messages right now.  John, what's up?  Hey, John.  Yeah.  You're on with David Wells.  What's up?  David, hey, how you doing?  Hey, I was wondering if you would be willing to sacrifice some of your salary to play with  the Yankees again.  I think that's the way it's going to be, period.  I don't think it's going to be the $10 million range anymore, but I can deal with that. 
[01:05:00]  Sure.  Why not?  Yeah.  Well, there you go.  Great.  Come on, Steinbrenner.  Call up.  Thank God I saved my money, huh?  Thanks, Uncle Ian.  Hey, David, grab a boob for me.  Okay.  Grab one.  Later.  Here's a big boob right here.  Oh, I'm sorry.  It's George.  He's grabbing George Steinbrenner.  We're on in Cleveland, and Mike wants to talk to you, David.  Mike, what's up?  Oh, not much.  I know the guy just asked you about playing for the Yankees, and how would you feel about 
[01:05:30]  playing for the Indians?  Not everybody here is as classless as the morons that were talking smack about your mom.  I would rather retire, to be honest with you.  Nice.  Damn.  Yeah.  I don't think that was necessary.  Sorry, man, but them people put a big dent in me, so it's just something that I can't  tolerate, that kind of stuff, man.  Yeah.  But my mom dies, and they keep dogging her.  It's something that, you know, that's why I hate them.  Yeah.  I mean, the city's come a long ways, and it's good for the city of Cleveland, but no 
[01:06:00]  way, man.  No way.  Yeah.  There you go.  There's your answer.  He ain't going there, Mike.  Tony, what's up?  Tony!  Hey, Dave.  Yeah, I heard you guys blast in Cleveland a little bit ago, among a bunch of other cities.  Would you have any problem going to play with any of those cities?  Any?  Any?  Which ones?  He just said he wouldn't go to Cleveland to play, Tony.  Okay.  Well, what about the other ones?  I mean, are there any, do you think, like, in the interviews, you just kind of got caught  up in the moment, or?  Which ones?  I don't know. 
[01:06:30]  I've heard you blast a bunch of Mike's lost count.  I haven't blasted in only but one.  Oh, yeah?  You just blasted Cleveland.  Me too.  We don't want to include them anyways, man.  What was that movie?  It was, uh, Josie and the Pussy.  It's a little too late, or a little too early to drink the bong water.  All right, Tony.  All right, all right.  I think you're rolled.  He pretty much wants to play for New York, or he's going to retire, right?  No.  I didn't say that.  You're going to retire if he doesn't leave.  This would be my first place to go.  Yeah, hell yeah.  Chicago was a great town, too.  Chicago was awesome. 
[01:07:00]  We're on in Chicago as well.  Yeah.  They would love to have you.  Chicago was awesome.  But isn't that an awful place?  It's the second New York.  Yeah.  Is there still in Chicago?  No, no, actually it's not.  It's, uh, well, they moved the fences in for, uh, for the hitters there, so it's a  little tougher.  And I'm a fly ball pitcher, so that sucks.  Isn't that IP annoying, though, in Chicago?  You don't hear that.  Chris, what's up?  Wrong stadium.  Yeah.  Yeah, true.  Chris, what's up?  Yo, what's up?  Hey.  Yo, Boomer, bro.  You're a great, bro.  I hope you guys come back to New York.  I'll tell you that.  I was kind of pissed when they traded your ass for Clemens. 
[01:07:30]  You were?  That was a joke.  That was a little shocking when that happened.  That was.  That was a joke.  I mean, come on.  It's a perfect game.  You know what I mean?  When they released, when they, when they traded me, they were behind bars because I  was so mad.  They knew I was going to go.  Oh, jeez.  No, it's, it's just the nature of the business, you know.  You got to deal with it and move on.  And, you know, I had a pretty good, uh, couple years after that, so.  Did you have any relationship with Clemens at all?  No, he's a great pitcher.  He's, he's done a lot of good things for baseball and, and he's done a couple of things 
[01:08:00]  that haven't been too good for baseball, so.  But, no, you can't take away what he's done.  And the Boston, uh, the Boston fans love Clemens.  This guy's from Boston.  He hates Clemens.  Boston.  All right, Chris.  Thank you.  All right.  Later.  Mark, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  How you doing?  I'd like to speak to David.  He's right here.  I work for, I work for a bus company and I, uh, did a charter and, uh, they made me,  uh, come into the game, uh, the day you pitched, uh, the perfect game. 
[01:08:30]  That's not a, that's not a bad day, huh?  Yeah, it was phenomenal.  It was the best day of my life.  Good.  I'm glad I can help it out.  It was mine too.  Yeah.  I still have the ticket stuff.  I still have the ticket stuff.  I was wondering how, uh, I can get it signed by you.  Come down to Hooters.  From five to seven, you get a sign.  Yeah.  He's signing everything at Hooters on 56 between 7th and Broadway.  Okay.  Are you in the area?  Uh, I'm in the city right now. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Thanks.  Well, come on by, man.  All right.  They're going downstairs in a few minutes, man.  I like these legendary stories that come up.  Uh, one of my favorite, one of my favorite David Wells moments was the night before, uh,  a start.  He was at Madison Square Garden for a range of game, drinking beer and eating chicken fingers  when most pitchers are praying or doing something else fruity.  And then, uh, asked Paul's about hanging out at Dorian's on the Upper East Side.  I saw him drink about a case of beer and shots.  A case of beer.  He just walks in there like any other guy off the street. 
[01:09:30]  That's right.  That's where you got to be.  No bodyguards, nothing.  Just go out and wing it, you know?  Have some fun.  Hey, I thought we were your bodyguards.  You are?  Yeah.  Bodyguards.  Yeah.  He's got his bodyguards.  Kyle, what's going on?  What's up, bro?  Hey, man.  Uh, David there?  Yeah, he's right here.  He's right here.  Sorry, dude.  Dave, you got to come back to New York, dude.  I was so pissed when they traded you for Clemens.  Uh, that day you wore that, uh, classic Yankee hat that you got to wear. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.  They give you all that stuff about wearing, you know, you can't wear the cap.  All they get off is me.  Let him be a Yankee.  Come on.  You personify Yankee greatness, dude.  And when you pitched that perfect game, it was sweet.  I'm going to hang out with this dude.  He's pumping me up here, man.  I appreciate it.  No, it was fun.  You know, it was the Bay Booth cap, so.  Dude, that was awesome.  He's got to keep his legend alive, you know.  Right on.  All right, later, boys.  All right.  Hey, is this guy getting laid?  Uh, saying that he's, uh, let's, uh, David.  Uh, Bluto, what's up? 
[01:10:30]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  David, you got to come back to New York.  I have been mistaking for you, I don't know how many times he got laid, about six times,  because everyone thought I was you.  They see your picture in the post.  Sweet.  They look at me, and that's you.  I say, yeah, but don't tell anybody.  Now you were pushing you were mean.  Now.  He better be good, man.  Oh, you better not be giving me a bad image.  Yeah, really, man.  Imagine that.  I'll be walking down this.  I got a fish eye a couple times.  I was. 
[01:11:00]  He was done in, like, two seconds.  Shut up.  He had a small mule and warts.  Hey, right on, Bluto.  Have fun with that.  God, that's got to suck, right?  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  It's Bowman.  What's up?  You.  Please come back.  Please.  How many deliveries of McDonald's would you take to come back?  That would, like, five out of the day?  That'd be perfect, right?  Yeah.  No, actually, I'd rather have the, uh, they should have a drive-thru Hooters in that way. 
[01:11:30]  And then the delivery.  You guys deliver?  Yeah, huh.  Oh, sweet.  Hooters deliver?  That would get me.  That would probably get me here.  Is it a little Asian guy on a bicycle that brings it, or is it some hot girl?  That would be so disappointing.  You're taking from Hooters in there.  You, you, you, $15.95.  Wait, where's the Hooters?  It's you.  You have penny?  Remember.  What?  I would drive you around in a rickshaw if you came back.  In a what?  And I think if you could, uh, get back to be, like, the fourth starter, you could kick that  spick's ass, can't you? 
[01:12:00]  Jesus.  You are awful.  Thank you, Chris.  Inappropriate, Bill.  We gotta get, we gotta get back to this home delivery thing.  So who, uh, comes to the apartment with the food?  It's usually a kitchen guy.  You know, that's usually a kitchen guy.  You know, you think, I would think it would, they would make so much.  No, don't lie.  We're in our roller skates.  We skate over the chicken wings and our little orange shorts.  I kid you not.  Can you imagine when he was coming in to your door?  Can you imagine how disappointed you would be if you opened the door and they're not there?  Then they would need me for the body garment. 
[01:12:30]  Exactly.  They would go, ah, ah, ah, ah.  You have to come in to the restaurant if you want the girls.  This is my last delivery of the night.  What are you, what are you doing?  Right.  You know?  Mind if I join you for those wings?  Some porno music starts up.  Boom, ticka, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  We got musicians in there.  Reese, what's going on?  Hey, Reese.  Hello?  What's up, Reese?  Hey, I want to know, David Wells.  What?  When you, uh, the night before you pitched a perfect game, did you turn around and was  at the Playboy Mansion and, uh, got all trashed or something like that? 
[01:13:00]  There was some rumor?  It wasn't the Playboy Mansion.  What was it?  Because I would have never made it for the game.  No, I was at Saturday Night Live.  Oh, all right, okay.  Yeah, so we, uh, we did a little, uh, after party there, so it was...  And then, uh, before you started the game, you were feeling too well and you turned around  and you said that you're going to go out and pitch a perfect game?  No, I can't predict those.  Those things just happened, luckily.  You know, you need nine guys behind or eight guys behind it and make that happen, but...  No, I just was, I was in the zone, I guess. 
[01:13:30]  I should go out and do that more often.  Yeah, that'd be nice.  Yeah.  All right, man.  All right, Reese.  Someone's saying you, uh, you wouldn't go to the Mets because you have a problem with Bobby Valentine?  Um, yeah, him and I have changed the words a lot of times, but you know what?  I think, you know, I've been pretty harsh on him last year or this year.  What's the problem with him?  You know, I don't know.  Just the same thing every Mets fan has?  Yeah, probably, but, you know, I have a lot of friends in the game that, uh, that play for him  and they just tell me what he's like, so I'm just basically going on on what they say  and all that, but no, I gotta calm it down because, you know, he is probably a nice guy 
[01:14:00]  and all that and I'm not giving him the benefit of the doubt, so...  Sorry, my boy.  Man, he wants to be back in New York so bad, you can just tell.  Oh, yeah.  I'm swinging, right?  You're like...  Well, if that's the case, man, I can get hardcore and I piss on it, man.  You know what?  Joe, what's up, bro?  Joe, David, listen, forget New York.  Come to Boston.  We need you.  Just come down.  It's almost as bad as Cleveland, man. 
[01:14:30]  The media sucks out here.  Just come down.  We need your help.  You gotta play at Fenway, dude.  Okay, let's go to ballpark and get a dog.  No, you know, I mean, the party scene down here is awesome.  You'll have a good time, man.  Boston's a great town, but, you know, if they get a different stadium, then sure,  but they gotta build it quick because I don't know how much time I got.  No, definitely.  Definitely.  Would you ever consider coming to Boston at all, though?  Sure.  Nice, dude.  When the Yankees are playing the Sox. 
[01:15:00]  It's so funny.  Every city's checking in.  Come to the Phillies.  We need you in Philadelphia.  Yeah, there's people out there now hiring.  Larry, what's up?  What's up, man?  Hey.  I mean, I understand you got David Wells and everybody loves him,  but, Norton, I'm disappointed.  There's two hot chicks in there.  Nobody's talking about him.  Yeah, that's what I'm telling you about.  There's six tens in here, and that's Major League Pitcher girl.  That's what Major League Pitchers get.  I have nothing to say.  I'm sitting next to David Wells.  I mean, let's talk about the chicks.  David Wells is going to play. 
[01:15:30]  Dude, I'm not going to fool around with him.  He pitched a perfect game.  What part of your body do you want this pin to go in, huh?  If you want to ask him a question.  If you guys y'all suck, man.  Ask him a question.  Yeah, what do you want to ask the ladies?  You can talk to us.  Yeah, he did.  Look at him.  He just hung up.  He chickened out.  Oh, my God.  Say that again.  You can't even approach girls like this.  What winks and makes love like a tiger.  Fuck.  Oh, and then she winks.  You girls all...  You do now. 
[01:16:00]  Hey, quit your grin and drop your linens and let's get sinning.  Oh, man.  Oh, boy.  These girls are loving you.  You can see it in their eyes.  You know, but a hop, skip, and a jump.  They're not even faking it.  We can tell them.  No, girls all faking and stuff.  You got the boyfriends and everything.  Yeah, yeah.  All of you.  Those are just the unapproachable girls unless you're a major league pitcher.  Did you see rings on their fingers?  No, I didn't.  What are you going to do, though?  Hi.  Hey, Mike.  What's up?  What's up, guys? 
[01:16:30]  Hey.  Hey, listen.  Dave.  What?  You got to come to Boston.  Oh, Steve.  There's another one.  Guy, we need you.  We got Pedro.  We got Nomar.  And that's it.  Nomar Garcia-Para.  And David Cohn, and that's it.  Yeah, I don't know about David Cohn.  I think he's a little too old, but.  No, he's not.  He did all right last year.  Yeah, he did do all right.  He came back last year.  Surprisingly, yeah, he did come back.  He could play on my team.  He couldn't have been any worse than the year before, so.  All right.  He could be on my team any time.  Yeah.  He's a good guy.  Hey, we got plenty of bars across the street, too. 
[01:17:00]  Bars.  Yeah, you just fall out of the stadium and fall onto Lansdowne Street.  Oh, yeah.  Right down there.  Yeah, right down Lansdowne Street.  We got everything.  That's definitely a good party area.  Y'all got to want to go to Boston.  Oh, absolutely.  You guys should know.  Go to the bar.  All right, Mike.  Hey, come to the bar.  Have a few beers.  All right.  David Wells is like the new Hef.  He's like the new Hugh Hefner with these girls.  Where's my pipe?  Where's my pipe?  Look at him.  Greg, what's going on?  Hey, Greg.  Yo.  Go ahead, man.  Oh, man.  I got a sad story about David Wells' perfect game. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  The day that he pitched it on a weekend.  So it was like on a Saturday, I think it was.  Yeah.  Or a Sunday.  Sunday.  So my wife said, we both had the weekend off.  I said, well, let's do something.  Let's go to a ballgame.  She wanted to go antiquing, so I had to compromise.  I ended up compromising and chose the wrong day.  I went the day before some whatever game, and instead of choosing Sunday, I chose Saturday  and ended up going antiquing on the day that she pitched the perfect game. 
[01:18:00]  That's why you never listen to your wife.  That's me, man.  That's awful, man.  I still don't let her live it down.  Well, if you don't want no lovin' for a while.  Yeah, you know what?  I got a beautiful armoire, you know?  I wonder if you could sign my armoire.  Is it antiquish?  Don't be there for history.  Go antiquing.  That would be a nice compromise.  He'll sign that for you if you go down to Hooters today.  You should pick it up and beat her to death with it. 
[01:18:30]  Nice.  Pull off that armoire.  Michael, what's up, bro?  Okay, how you doing?  All right, Michael.  Well, after what Steinbrenner did to you, you'd play for him again?  He's a great guy.  I've always, even when he's...  He's a pimp.  I mean, you know, you shouldn't whore yourself out.  Why wouldn't you play for the Mets other than Yankees?  He is a pimp, Daddy.  I'll tell you that.  He's got his groove.  What are you going to be?  He's number one whore? 
[01:19:00]  I mean, come on, man.  Play some men.  Why cut off your nose to spite your face?  You know, you want to play with the Yankees?  Why the hell wouldn't you want to play with the Yankees?  Anthony, don't start telling you about how Mets fans should act, too, as well.  All right?  Oh, please.  I'm directing this towards well.  I'm not saying a Mets fan should act.  You're acting perfectly for a team of losers.  This is great.  Excuse me, Anthony.  Okay?  You're a loser this year.  Sit down and shut up.  All right?  I hear your mouth every year when they win to begin with.  First of all, I wasn't playing.  Talking well.  I'm not talking to you.  I'm not a loser because I wasn't playing the game with the Yankees.  You're benched.  And, yeah, I was benched. 
[01:19:30]  You're getting pitch hit for.  And, you know, I don't think anybody's got to make excuses for the Yankees this season.  The Mets, where were they?  Well, I mean, I understand that, but I hear your mouth every single year.  All right, just do me a second.  We'll turn the damn thing off, man.  No, no, no, no, no.  I'm just saying, Wells, why would you play for Steinbrenner?  I mean, he's Joe, you know, pimp.  The guy's always pipping people out.  And he slapped you after what you did.  Perfect game.  And you're turning around.  You've got to play for him again. 
[01:20:00]  You've got to whore yourself out that bad.  You know what?  I can accept that being a whore today.  Yes.  Okay.  He's agreeing.  I'm agreeing.  That's not even being a whore.  He's playing for the Yankee fans who love David Wells.  And he knows that he's loved him by the Yankee fans.  Everybody knows he was traded.  And didn't want to leave.  That's not being a whore.  Norton, you're the biggest whore in all.  I'm not a whore.  Now we'll agree with that.  Are you working your way down the table, sir?  Yeah.  All right.  You've got a point.  But he's going to leave me alone today.  I know it.  I mean, you'll get along with, without a doubt, get along with our manager, Mets manager, 
[01:20:30]  everybody else you get along with.  Steinbrenner, you know, you're sitting there, you like the guy after what he did to you.  I just can't follow that.  Hey, he wants to play in October.  That's right.  Hey, you got anything derogatory?  You got any with that, Anthony, okay?  Hey, you got anything derogatory to say to those women here?  No.  Well, women are lovely.  I just had to direct it towards you.  We're going to handcuff all the guys in this room to a bench, and we'll take care of them.  Don't worry, okay?  Take care.  Yeah, but leave.  That one's a wild one right there.  All right, Wells.  Seriously, think about it. 
[01:21:00]  I mean, when the Mets come calling, man, seriously, think about it.  I got you back, dude.  We would love to have you.  All right, man.  Right?  Right, Michael?  You got it.  All right.  You got it open.  Bye.  Dude, I'm seeing a girl now.  She's relatively hot.  And if David re-sign...  Graham Lloyd.  Tall chick with an accent.  G'day, Mike.  But if you re-sign in New York, I will let you bang her whenever you want.  I'll keep that in mind.  Who's the pimp now?  Who's the pimp now?  Kyle, what's up? 
[01:21:30]  What's up?  This is Columbus now.  Yeah.  Making a pitch for Wells.  What's up, Kyle?  Hey, I want to know what he felt about playing in Cincy.  Cincy was cool.  Just had one bad woman there, man.  Thank God she's out of the making.  Yeah.  I tell you what, that lady had some serious problems.  She did, definitely.  I'm glad she's gone.  No, but Cincinnati was a great town.  Well, you have a good Marge Shot story for us, David?  Yeah.  Give us a good story.  Come on, give us a good story.  It is nothing big, but no, we were taking batting practice, and she brought Shotzi out to the field. 
[01:22:00]  The dog.  So I started barking, just getting the dog riled up.  Well, the dog got so excited and riled up, it ran right to shortstop and took a dump.  And Barry Larkin's looking at me, goes, what are you doing, man?  So she told me to go clean it up.  I said, no, it's your damn dog.  You go clean the crap up.  And then she's like, hit her face, man.  She turned beet red, didn't know what to do.  So anyway, she took her dog, took it out to the parking lot, and I don't know if she knows where everyone's car, but her dog took a crap right next to my car. 
[01:22:30]  I was like, okay.  So I went right upstairs and just, I told her, I mean, I can't say it on the thing, but it was pretty good.  You called it the C word, didn't you?  Yes, I did.  I love that.  The A-bomb, the A-bomb word.  Broke out the A-bomb.  I can slip a few of those from time to time.  But no, and I think that's why, because I was ready to resign there, and I think that's the reason why I didn't.  But yeah, she was, she's a twerp.  Oh, wow.  All right, let's go to D.C. now.  Garrett, what's up? 
[01:23:00]  Hey, man, what's going on?  All right.  Hey, Dave Weld needs to come play for the Orioles.  Look at everybody.  I already did that once.  I already did that once.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  How did that work out?  It didn't.  He's loved all over the country.  Everybody wants him there.  Man, I'm going to go lobbying.  Who doesn't want a major league pitcher that you might just see at a bar some night?  You know what I mean?  Hell, I might, if I play, I might suck.  You never know.  Yeah.  Everyone says I'm washed up, too old.  Boy, there's pressure on you.  Yeah.  Too much. 
[01:23:30]  Costanza, what's up?  Hey, guys, how are you?  Good.  We're hanging out with David Wells.  I know.  Dave, I love you, man, but you killed me in my fantasy league this year.  You killed me.  Well, I would love to have you.  Hang with him, pal.  I will.  I'll still take you in the second round any day.  Right on.  But listen, I'd love to talk about baseball, but I want to talk about, do these girls all  play wiffle ball?  Yes, they do.  Do we play wiffle ball?  Yeah.  Of course we play wiffle ball.  Go ahead.  You guys up for the challenge at all, by any chance? 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, we'll get them involved in a wiffle ball game, sure.  Oh, sure.  I'll buy a boatload of chicken from New York to Boston.  Yeah, I don't think.  Yeah.  All right, Costanza.  All right, guys.  You suck.  Soft tacos.  They're so shy here, they want filet mignon.  Yeah.  David, what did you think of Kim's performance there on the Diamondbacks?  Some young Kim?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's a beat-up man, I tell you.  I feel for him, though, because he's out there on his own. 
[01:24:30]  I don't know if he speaks the language, speaks American or anything, so I felt like, I felt  babbling like I did Hideki Arabi when he first came over, so you're out there in your own  world and you don't know what the hell is going on, and then you give up back-to-back  night.  Back-to-back?  Well, that was kind of silly, putting him in two in a row like that.  Well, that was a gutsy move by Bob.  It was very gutsy, but it's the World Series, for God's sake, and that was kind of stupid.  Hey, the end result, though, they won.  Hey, and it erased everything, so he's not a go-to. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, thank God.  He must have just completely released every bodily fluid.  Oh, can we all talk like this now?  I get the ring.  I got ring.  Elmo.  And money.  Yeah.  They got a big payday there.  Hey, Elmo, what's up?  Hey.  Elmo.  Dave, I have a question about your perfect game.  Fire away.  After it was over, did you, like, get to bang some hot celebrities?  Uh-huh. 
[01:25:30]  He does put you up a notch.  Pleading the fifth there.  All right, bye.  I can't incriminate myself like that now.  There you go.  We got to get you out of here.  I got that good guy image, you know?  And we're here to support that.  So these ladies are going to be signing the calendars downstairs?  Yeah.  Right next to you?  Wow, man.  They are so incredibly hot, these girls.  Can we do the rest of the show for the holders?  Why not?  Yeah.  Come play with us.  We got Bob with the weather.  He'll get it started. 
[01:26:00]  Great.  They're going to leave, and the studio's going to go back to swelling.  They smell like sweaty scrote.  Okay, can you define, define scrote?  Yambag.  Yambag.  Yambag.  Yambag.  Reagan's neck.  They'll keep you company when we're not here.  Hey, guys, man, you're going to have a couple minutes to talk about this.  This is going to blow your mind.  Yeah.  Wow.  Literally.  Let me see one of those, Sninky.  Holy S.  Wow, the Hooters came in.  Holy Jesus.  Look at that.  Keep it in your pants, all right?  That is beautiful.  What month is every month? 
[01:26:30]  Take off your pants and jacket, right?  It does.  Rank out a batch all over November.  Why not?  Hey, welcome to my show.  Take your pants off and jacket.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Hey, Hans, you okay, Hans?  Hey, that's Hans.  Who?  Hans.  Who's he?  Appropriate name while you're looking through the magazine.  Hey, check out Rebecca.  Who's he?  Very attractive girl.  That's Danish pastry right there.  I'm the guy that gets it out.  Make sure he gets the show on time.  Oh, really?  See, he's got the radio voice. 
[01:27:00]  I do.  Let's get David Wells out of here.  Let's get the Opie and Hans show.  Looks like my older brother or something.  All right.  What?  All proceeds from the sale of calendars, baseballs, and perfect game items will be donated to the windows of Hope,  the charitable organization helping families of restaurant workers lost in the Twin Towers disaster  and our neighbors at Engine Company No. 23 and Police Precinct No. 13.  I'm glad you said it because I couldn't get that out this morning.  That was one sentence.  That was tongue-tied.  That was one sentence. 
[01:27:30]  I took the calendar with me, and I was so tongue-tied, man.  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, that's nice.  All right.  I'm just thumbing through it here.  Well, we've got to get him downstairs.  People are waiting there.  From 5 to 7, he's signing just about everything.  The girls are signing the calendars.  The calendar looks great.  It's Hooters on 56 between 7th and Broadway.  Yeah, get down there.  David Wells, thank you.  Thank you.  Thanks, girls.  Thanks.  Have fun.  Next time, can you guys be a little more energetic here, huh?  They did their jobs, man.  It was just nice looking at them.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, that's wrong, baby!  Woo!  Woo!  Yeah.  Sure.  And we're finally back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Jesus.  Finally back with the O&A Show.  See, we went so long.  David Wells was in here for about an hour straight.  And then we had to kind of make up for lost time there. 
[01:28:30]  In the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-277-4.  Wow.  Pretty hot Hooters girls there, huh?  Pretty nice.  They're the ringers.  Yeah.  They fly them in from other cities, huh?  Well, they don't work downstairs.  Only a couple of them do.  Yeah.  They're the ones that are in all the advertisements.  They're in the calendar.  Yes, they are.  These girls were hotter than anything I've seen in Playboy. 
[01:29:00]  Let's just put it that way.  Hooters chicks from downstairs, Hooters.  A couple are from the downstairs Hooters.  I thought we had a couple that could make the calendar, dude, from the last time that  we were there.  All the girls you saw are in the Hooters calendar, and a couple of them work downstairs.  So there you go.  Old Dirty in the studio.  Old Dirty.  What's up, bro?  What's going on in the hood?  Yo, what's going on in the hood, man?  Not much, man.  The police are coming back from ground zero with attitudes.  So now we've got to handle that.  I have not noticed any NYPD with attitudes all dirty. 
[01:29:30]  What seems to be happening in your neighborhood, man?  Hold on.  Who's stopping you?  Hold on.  Slow down.  Slow down.  The cops were busy at ground zero, so you guys were probably running wild in the hood.  Oh, my God.  No, no, no.  We were operating with some constraints, of course, seeing that there was a national emergency.  So you guys were running wild.  We were running both wild.  It was a holiday, man.  You didn't want to take away important resources from where they were needed to come for some, 
[01:30:00]  maybe somebody blowtorching the heads off of parking means.  Check it, check it.  This one cat I know had gone to the precinct, and he came back.  Yo!  I was like, yo, what happened, dude?  He's like, yo, the pen is locked down.  The lights are off.  They ain't taking nobody to central booking.  So, you know, this criminal activity mind, you know what I'm saying, starts churning.  The wheels start rolling.  Right.  You know what I mean?  So, seeing that they wasn't taking people to central booking that night, you know, we 
[01:30:30]  decided to exploit the situation.  See?  And now you're saying they have an attitude.  What do you exploit?  No, I can't say.  He never says what he does, Opie.  He never incriminates himself.  He's a professional.  You're taking advantage.  What do my other people have exploited?  Not you, of course.  Sales are up 80%.  No, it's not.  Hell yeah.  Take that.  The white powder sales are way down.  Who in their right mind is going to, like, buy some white powder and not be paranoid that 
[01:31:00]  there might be a little Thrax in there?  Thrax.  You know something, though?  I don't think that's true.  Because people doing coke, they don't care if there is Thrax in it, as long as they're  getting their coke.  Yo, let me tell you about this story, though.  This cat, yo, I don't know where he got this, his information from.  This guy ground up, like, clear bottles to a point where it looked powdery, dude.  My man, this other cat took a...  He sniffed something.  He snorted.  Dude, he's sniffing glass.  His whole nasal cavity's chopped up, dude. 
[01:31:30]  He might not make it.  Big ups to the brother, too, in ICU.  Why did the guy do that?  They sold him something that it was crushed glass.  Crushed glass?  It's like powder, dude.  Y'all.  It looked like fish cow.  You know what fish cow is.  Don't look at me like that.  That's the good stuff.  Peruvian flake.  You know what I'm saying?  Woof.  Wow.  Crime goes on. 
[01:32:00]  We feel that the police have come back from ground zero with an attitude.  And I can understand that.  Don't mess with the police.  Oh, no, no.  I ain't messing with that.  No, no, no, no.  I love the police, man.  I love them.  You lost as many brothers as they did.  Dude, I mean, old dirty has.  But seriously, remember that carjacking that went bad?  And the guy had a gun?  Well, there you go.  He's lost some brothers, too.  Yeah, boy.  We've seen the struggle.  But, I mean, seriously.  The struggle.  The struggle to get his seatbelt off so you can throw him out of his own car.  I mean, we always considered around where we lived. 
[01:32:30]  Fire department, yo, they're heroes, dude.  Because you ain't making me run into a burning building unless I left my whole cache of stash and my money.  Right.  What's important to you?  That's the only one I'm going in, you know?  But then, after September 11th, I mean, I understand the police, they had a duty to go in there.  But the fire department, yo, they're required to go in there.  You know what I'm saying?  What are you talking about?  So then everybody's jumping on the bandwagon saying that the police department, they're heroes.  And I'm not taking that away from them, man.  Holy ass.  But I've been getting, we've been getting F'd by the police for two years, dude. 
[01:33:00]  Who's we?  You mean the people that are perpetrating crimes all dirty?  No, well.  Those people?  Well, people that perpetrate crimes, they, you know.  You can't say it's a black or white thing.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  You're as white as I am with your little Clark Gable mustache.  I get a little goatee like you, Opie.  I'm ready to end.  Hey, I look like Mark McGuire now.  David Wells said so.  He's not as white as you are.  He's not dark.  Maybe not, but he's not as white as you are.  You can't use the black-white excuse thing.  No, no.  I'm not using the black-white excuse. 
[01:33:30]  It's the criminal, non-criminal.  It seems the criminals usually have more run-ins with the police, Opie, than the non-criminals.  And they hold a grudge.  If you commit criminal acts, dude, and you're stupid enough to get caught, then you deserve to be in police contact.  Okay.  And go into court and central booking and legal aid.  But there's a lot of innocent people getting stopped, frisked.  Man, they thought I was Osama's third cousin.  I was detained, Anthony.  You were detained?  Dude.  What were you detained, this total terrorist? 
[01:34:00]  Y'all, I didn't shave for a couple of days, so I was kind of furry.  You looked a little Middle Eastern?  Yeah, I looked a little Hindu-ish, you know what I'm saying?  Hindu?  You're out of your effing mind.  The Arabs, the Hindus, they're all the same, bro.  You've been snorting the glass.  So then the gentleman, I didn't have my idea with me that particular day.  He comes, he goes, where you from, blah, blah, blah, this.  And I'm like, yo, why are you stopping me?  He goes, because you look of Middle Eastern descent.  That's such a lie.  I go, why is that?  All you have to do is open your mouth and people know that you're not from the Middle East. 
[01:34:30]  Dude, but hey, wait a minute.  I know a couple of Arabs that could pass for, yo.  Oh, shut up.  Give me, yo, Opie.  You're out of your mind.  I'm on the front lines, kid.  Front lines?  Front lines of what?  Oh, my God.  I'm on the front lines, kid.  You are going to be on the front line of a ham and cheese sandwich at Central Booking the  next time.  You and I get together, my friend.  Who's that?  He's a cop.  He's a cop.  He's a cop.  He's a cop.  What's the problem?  Que problema, loco?  You're insulting a lot of cops right now.  No, I'm not.  You are. 
[01:35:00]  No, no, no.  My point has been misconstrued.  Misconstrued.  Misconstrued.  What does that mean, dude?  You have lost a lot of fans today.  No, no, no, no, no.  The phones are going nuts.  You're on your own mind.  You had a good two months of extra business, and now it's time to get back to the game.  That's all.  You know it's a game, and it's time for you to pay your dues.  That's all.  The cat and mouse game.  The cat was away for a while.  It was.  The mice were able to nibble at that cheese, and now the cat's coming back. 
[01:35:30]  Wait, wait.  Keith, I've got to ask you something.  All seriousness, did crime go down or up since 9-11 in Manhattan?  Or actually in the five boroughs?  You know something?  I haven't really seen the stats, so it's hard for me to say.  I don't know.  From what I heard on the news, whatever you can believe, it did drop.  Especially violent crime dropped.  You know, what are you going to do?  People feel for people, even criminals.  No, no. 
[01:36:00]  People were shook a lot.  Like the first day, you know, that all the events happened, and the days after that, you  know, where everybody was up in the air, what's going to happen?  I thought we were going to see more looting.  No, no.  They don't loot anymore in New York.  Yo, you heard about that corrections officer that went down to Tuno Corner downstairs in  the proms?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, one of the malls underneath the trade center and stole the watches.  That's just stupidity.  Watches, watches, watches.  Watches, watches, watches.  But no, I'm not trying to take anything away from the police department.  Can you be crazy, man? 
[01:36:30]  You brothers are heroes.  What I'm saying is, yo, I feel like, I don't know, man.  In my opinion, I mean, yo, they're heroes in one extent, man.  But I can't, I can't, you know, go back and say, oh, erase everything that, all the bad  times that I ever faced, you know, in front of a police officer.  With him taking you into custody for committing a crime, bro.  Oh, that's right.  You know, it's a type of criminal.  A criminal, the criminal.  That's all I'm saying.  You were a criminal before.  You ain't going to like us now.  You were a criminal to begin with.  My brother, I'm innocent, be proof, and guilty, my man.  What's up with the Constitution, you see? 
[01:37:00]  Old Dirty, you're out of your mind.  Oh, my.  Keith, I got to let more cops add Old Dirty.  Chris, what's up?  Yeah, Opie, Anthony, how are you?  Hey, man, what's happening?  I'm pissed off at Old Dirty today.  Yeah, I got to talk to Buckwheat over there and see what his problem is.  What do you got against those cops?  Why doesn't he like us?  Nah, nah, I got nothing against the police, man.  You need to explain yourself, bro.  I think he's saying that it's fantastic what the police did, but in his opinion, it doesn't 
[01:37:30]  erase all the abuse that the criminals have had to endure.  Yo, I'm a liar.  Listen to what this guy told me.  No, what you mean criminals?  I didn't even see.  He's not innocent.  Damn it.  He's not guilty.  I was going to hire you as my spokesman, dude.  That's what you're saying, though.  No, I didn't say that.  And now you're pissed because the free ride's over and the cops are coming back into the  neighborhood.  Nah, they're coming back.  Welcome back, fellas.  Oh, man, well, we can't wait to see you.  Oh, come on.  I'd love to come visit you.  Don't tie in the cuffs up when you throw me in the back of the car, dude. 
[01:38:00]  Throw you in the back of the car.  You even know they tighten up the cuffs.  You got to get tuned up first.  Not the NYPD.  Tune them up a little first.  That's LAPD, not NYPD.  Nah, you guys.  Yo, I wasn't saying anything to a robber to her about it.  Old Ray, they treat you nice.  They hold your head when they put you in the patrol car and stuff.  They make sure you don't bump your head.  Oh, yeah.  On the top of the door.  So every time I watch cops, I see that.  No matter how much of a prick the perp is, they always gently put them in the car.  They loosen your cuffs up. 
[01:38:30]  Loosen the cuffs.  They strain you out.  I've seen that before.  The guy goes, you know.  You all be.  My cuffs are too tight, B.  And all of a sudden, they're like, all right, come here.  And they loosen them up for it.  They go, oh, I'm sorry.  Then they dust off the back of the car.  My mistake.  You know, the back of the car.  Because you are innocent.  Right.  And then they watch the head.  Yeah.  Doesn't hit the top of the door.  They gently lure your head under the, you know, into the doorway.  And you sit down nicely.  Yeah.  So what's your problem?  But, dude, since that's your business, technically, every time you have to pay for a lawyer,  isn't that a write-off anyway?  A little tax deduction he gets for that. 
[01:39:00]  Government allows him that.  Hey, Chris, you're doing a great job out there.  All right.  Thank you.  But one more thing.  Old Dirty pays taxes?  Do you?  Not really.  Good point, Chris.  Yeah, yeah, I do.  You have to have an income to pay taxes.  You don't have a, you haven't had a job in a while.  Who?  You.  I'm on vacation.  I'm on vacation.  I'm getting ready for the winter.  You've been on vacation for two years, my brother.  I'm getting ready for the winter solstice.  It's coming up.  The longest day.  And I'm getting ready for it.  Okay.  He's on vacation. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, and hey, have a good night, guys.  Take care.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Yobi.  Nothing but cops, thanks to you calling in now.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, man.  Hey.  Listen, give this guy direction to the Brooklyn Bridge and send him over here.  We're going to give him a wood shampoo here.  Oh, okay?  What's a wood shampoo?  What's a wood shampoo?  A wood shampoo?  I take my baton out of my belt and I can't introduce him to his head.  The wood shampoo.  I'd love to meet this month.  Now, now, we won't be.  We will not use extra force when apprehending the... 
[01:40:00]  He's been out of shopping.  He's been out of shopping for what we've been down here thinking, and now he's complaining  because we're coming back and doing our job.  That's a reasonable force.  What a music guy.  No unreasonable force when...  That's reasonable.  When handling the perp.  All right?  The perp got to make it to one...  The perp got to make it in one place to...  Well, Dirty, what were you thinking of accomplishing today by, like, trashing cops?  See, you're saying that I'm trashing cops.  I'm not trashing the police. 
[01:40:30]  I love the police.  You know, it's a great thing that's happened recently that I've noticed.  Remember when camcorders first became affordable and everyone had it, and they didn't know what  the hell to videotape.  Everyone's out.  They walk into the house videotaping.  And a lot of situations happened where the cops were videotaped controlling a violent  criminal and taken out of context that might have looked like they were abusing this perp. 
[01:41:00]  Now, people are bored with their camcorders, and I say, thank God you don't have as much  of these goddamn videos, and we get back to old-fashioned tune-ups of some of these guys  because some of them need a little bit of that discipline, some of that wood shampoos.  Phone book on the head, maybe.  I like the old-fashioned phone book so it doesn't cut them and leave a mark.  But I'll tell you this, though.  Ike Turner used to use that.  Good boy.  Back in the early 80s, late 80s, you know, before the sweeping changes, you know, with  the whole law enforcement community and all that, and, you know, you weren't going to 
[01:41:30]  beat up the perp and all that.  You guys called that the renaissance, didn't you?  Oh, dude.  That was a wonderful, wonderful time for the criminals.  The Dinkins administration and the cops were the bad guys.  No, they weren't the bad guys.  I mean, the cops weren't behind the administration, dude.  Oh, please.  Dinkins was going to the bedside of drug dealers that were shot by the cops instead of going  to the cops that were upset they had to shoot people.  Yo, man.  Give me a break.  The fact of the matter is that the police deserve a race. 
[01:42:00]  They need a race.  Then they wouldn't walk out pissed off and with attitudes every morning of coming, you  know, out of me.  Oh, my God.  He's got an angle on everything.  And old dirty is out there just so they can get some overtime.  Yo, dude.  If I'm trying to put food on the table, man, is that a crime?  If I'm trying to go to a car.  Get a job.  Yo, I'm on vacation.  I told you that.  How long have you been on vacation?  I'm preparing for the winter solstice.  Right.  He's stocking up his nuts.  The winter solstice is the shortest day.  Is it?  It's the longest night, though. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, it is.  Oh, I forgot your days are the nights.  So you're right.  My bad.  Bill, what's up?  You animal.  What's up, man?  Bill, go ahead.  You're on the radio.  Speak.  Yeah, I just wanted to say that I kind of side.  I don't really side with old dirty, but I kind of feel that maybe a lot of people did scrutinize  the cops before the September 11th attacks.  Now, all of a sudden, that day happened.  Everybody kind of forgot about everything.  Well, you know something? 
[01:43:00]  It also just goes to show you what a bunch of hypocrites, the people that were criticizing  every move the cops made.  Because now, all of a sudden, it wasn't popular with their constituency to go out there and  bash the cops because of the September 11th events.  So then they all turned around and now they're patting the police on the back and everything's  fine now.  Yeah.  What happened to the same scumbags that were questioning every move these cops were making  to make it safe to walk down the streets or get into a goddamn subway for the past eight 
[01:43:30]  years or so?  So, and what happened?  Why aren't they jumping out and saying, where the hell's Reverend Al been?  Yeah.  I am outraged.  I am outraged.  Remember, he was always on the news every goddamn week.  That's what I'm talking about.  This son of a bitch was on the news bashing the cops.  I am outraged that people are bashing the police. 
[01:44:00]  We must support the police department in everything they do.  I, myself, I am handing out Reverend Al plungers to go into every precinct of every borough.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Okay, old dirty.  I'll give myself a bell.  I have too much grease in my hair.  I'm going to a precinct and get what they call the wood shampoo. 
[01:44:30]  Give Reverend Al a wood shampoo.  Yo, Al, though, you came out kind of timid after you did your little bed, though, right?  Hey, you go to jail.  It changed my life.  I had a guy, Bubba, would give me, he'd give me a massage every night.  His big, meaty hands on my shoulders.  And somehow he was able to massage Reverend Al's ass at the same time.  How he'd do that with both hands on my shoulders, I'll never know. 
[01:45:00]  And I learned to say, I like mine with syrup.  Yo, Al, when you were locked up, did you go to rec?  I always hung out.  You saw how thin Reverend Al got.  Oh, yeah.  When I was in the joint.  I was a bag of bones.  But then I'd work out.  I'd get the big, uh, the big, uh, spack of buckets full of water and a broom handle.  And I would work out.  One, two.  One, two.  Yo, when you were locked up, you had your soap on the rope, or?  I put it around Reverend Al's neck along with my big Volkswagen hubcap medallion. 
[01:45:30]  Because I made the mistake of dropping the soap once.  And it looked like one of them bad scenes that everyone tunes out in on the show Oz.  No one wants to see that.  Reverend Al bent over, gave a full moon.  Now I put my soap on a, firmly on a rope.  Reverend Al learned the hard way, and I do mean hard.  Yo, yo, Reverend Al, you was crying when your visits came?  You had tears in your eyes? 
[01:46:00]  Tears in my eyes.  When I'd see my, my family come and visit me through that cold glass.  And I'd talk on the phone.  I'd pick up the phone.  Hiya, baby.  I miss you.  Show me your boobies through the glass.  Give me prison visit.  See that little screen on the bottom?  Could you please blender up some chicken and pour it right through there with a funnel?  Because I'm hungry.  They ain't feeding me in the joint.  You, you, you, they make yourself a little pocket friend for them cold, lonely nights. 
[01:46:30]  I made myself a pocket friend.  And I learned what you got to do is take a towel and a rubber glove.  And you roll the rubber glove up in the towel real tight and fasten it with rubber bands.  And then you call it, uh, Judy, or Jenny, or whatever you want to call it.  And then you, uh, you lube it up.  And then go to town.  Reverend Al needed some loving. 
[01:47:00]  Ding, ding, ding.  Ben, what's going on?  I'm smoking hot dogs in my booty.  Hey, Ben, what's up?  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, this is Benny from D.C., man.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a cop here in this town.  Uh-huh.  I left New York in 99, man.  And, and, and, and one of the reasons I actually came down here, besides the money, was the fact that cops there, when the dialogue just happened, and people like this scumbag here talking crap about the guys on the job who are out risking their ass every day. 
[01:47:30]  And now I'm down here in Chocolate City, where 67% of the department is.  So don't be a cop.  So don't be a cop.  You can't handle it.  Guess what?  Huh?  You don't, you don't want to handle it?  You don't want to be a white scumbag?  So don't be a cop.  White cops, you know what I'm saying?  It's the same as white cops, because you're out of line.  Who's out of line?  And if you're out of line, expect a beating, babe.  That's all I got to say.  Yeah, what about the black cops that go into the black communities and, and have to rack a little head in there because, uh, they're just dealing with, uh, criminals? 
[01:48:00]  Let me tell you something.  Yes?  Like I said before, man, if you're a criminal, committing criminal acts, and you're stupid enough to get caught and fall into the hands of the police, and whatever they do to you, bro, that's what they're going to do to you, man.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  Stopping guys.  Y'all do it.  On a daily basis.  Y'all do it.  It ain't enough that you're going to handcuff a brother and just throw him in the car or walk off.  You know what I'm saying?  Once you handcuff, it's all right to punch him in the face.  Right, man?  Shut up, man.  Just standing on the corner in the rain.  Shut up.  Man, my brother.  There's a lot of things to do on the corner.  Whatever, man.  Whatever.  Man, whatever. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  Legal aid to take care of that.  Let me ask you something.  Where you from?  Where I'm from?  Yeah, where you from, movie?  Why, why you want to know?  Why?  Because I bet you're Lily Whiten from the suburbs, babe.  That's what I bet.  No, he's not.  Sorry.  I have 4.5 kids and a Volvo.  All right, Ben.  Thank you.  Anytime.  I love this indication.  Now cops all over the country can hate you.  Can hate old dirty.  Here's an Ohio cop.  National hatred.  Mike, what's going on?  What's going on?  Hey, bro.  Hey, you know, he's sitting there bashing cops. 
[01:49:00]  What about, you know, black guys shoot somebody?  Right, so all of a sudden we hate black people now?  Every black person's a bad guy?  Actually, yes, sir.  Oh, God.  No, it's wild.  No, it's wild.  Oh, God.  Why doesn't the same thing apply?  Listen, listen to me, bro.  All right.  Good question.  Now, what police officers are necessary in our society, there are elements that would  do harm to us.  You are there to protect us. 
[01:49:30]  That's what my taxes are going for.  All right, man.  Your taxes are going.  All right.  I understand.  Yo, your job is to apprehend, your job is to stop, your job is to apprehend and stop  violent felony offenders.  Oh, no, it isn't.  Oh, my God.  That's part of it.  Part of it.  But I think that's the most important.  Right?  You want to get rid of the violence.  The violence that are put in place all dirty.  Don't you think some of these laws are ludicrous here?  I agree with you, but that's not for us to argue about.  That's to be changed during elections and appointments. 
[01:50:00]  But I'm not going to affect that you go out, man.  That's a brave thing, my brother.  You've got to put a bulletproof suit on me if I'm going out to stop the bad guys.  Oh, yeah.  Bad guys got more artillery than the cops.  Don't you realize you're one of the bad guys?  No, I ain't bad.  He's calling.  He's talking about them like they're other people.  He's got the devil's advocate.  He's trying to look in the mirror, my brother.  What are you talking about?  You haven't had a job in years.  I'm telling you, I'm getting ready. 
[01:50:30]  All right, guys.  You guys rock, man.  All right.  But you know what?  This cop raised a good point, though.  At a certain point he raised it was really valid.  If you blame one black person for the behavior of all bad black people or whatever, or you  know what I mean?  Behave all four.  Right, right.  You're a racist.  Or if you blame all women for the behavior of one, you're a sexist.  But if you blame all cops for the behavior of a couple of bad ones, you're hip and liberal.  And then all the cops are Nazis, depending on what one or two did.  Very good point.  I'll give you a bell. 
[01:51:00]  That's a very good point.  It drives me nuts.  Bad cops, all right.  But most of them are not bad, and they all get blamed.  Doug, what's going on?  What's up?  This scumbag, you're lower than horse crap.  You're a little spick prick.  You know what?  They put your head down when you go in the back of the car.  Tell me why.  You don't get none of that monkey grease on top of the car.  Tell me why.  Why?  Tell me why.  You're a piece of garbage.  You're a piece of garbage.  Officer, officer.  Go get a real job.  Stop living off our taxes.  Do we have to go there, officer?  You damn banana-eating monkey.  You're a monkey. 
[01:51:30]  That's where everybody looks at your kind, and they look down below.  You're worse than a friggin' dog.  You smell worse than a dog, you spick.  Oh, shut up.  Yeah, what?  Wow.  Jesse, what's up?  Yeah, listen, I'm all away with this man right here, okay?  He's right.  The cops are too harassed sometimes, man.  They coming out the thing.  When I come off the bridge sometimes, they're searching my van.  I'm a Puerto Rican, okay?  Dude, it's a van.  Let me tell you something, quickly.  He's not a spick.  He's not a spick. 
[01:52:00]  He's a Dominican.  Jesse.  Jesse, let me ask you something.  Have you noticed them searching other people's vans and trucks?  Listen, listen.  I'm a Puerto Rican, you understand?  Yeah.  I'm a dark Puerto Rican.  You know, one cop, Puerto Rican cop, told me I should shave my beard off because I grew  like a damn Arab.  Well, you know something?  In this time, in this day and age, maybe that would help you out.  Yeah, listen.  What are you going to do?  You're going to change people's thinking?  I did it the next day, buddy.  All right, there you go.  You know, but I mean, like that last cop, he's calling him a spick. 
[01:52:30]  Why he's got to do that for?  Was he a cop?  I don't even know if he was a cop.  He didn't say he was a cop, did he?  No, that wasn't a cop.  That wasn't a cop.  Okay.  That's not right.  That was one of our regular listeners.  He was just really pissed off.  He's not a cop.  Yeah, because he's a dumbass, then, because, I mean, why are you going to call people by  racial names, then, you know?  I'm a spick, okay?  Oh, jeez.  God, in my back, yo, I ain't even bashing the police, dude.  You know?  I'm bashing the police.  Oh, Dirty, you all right, man?  Yeah, man, peace, baby.  There you go.  A couple of stellar members of society right here getting along with each other. 
[01:53:00]  Hey, Joe, what's up?  Be nice.  Hey, old Dirty.  Yo, what's this?  I'm showing you jealousy.  You can have another bowl of cornflakes and water.  Actually, I...  They ain't going to let that throw.  Dump that out, dude.  You said go back to your pea stain and cornflakes.  Yo, dude, actually, I probably live better than you.  I doubt that.  Go eat some more cornflakes and water.  Cornflakes and water?  Wait, wait.  What you talking about?  Wait, you live better than Joe.  You don't even have a job.  That's all right, man.  PlayStation.  PlayStation 2 rocks. 
[01:53:30]  Cornflakes and Kool-Aid.  DVD collection, Kool-Aid.  My brother, I drink natural orange juice.  What's the latest scam in the hood?  Scam ain't no scams.  What are you guys selling in the hood these days?  Nothing, boss.  No fast-moving items?  Nah, nah, nah.  You guys selling the Xbox yet?  Mmm.  Xbox.  Oh, yeah, Microsoft.  Been looking into that.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's going to be a big item.  Yo, what date that ships, Earl?  I don't want to know.  It's already shipping.  It's already in the stores.  Oh, it's shipping out already?  The Xbox is in the stores. 
[01:54:00]  I didn't know that.  I heard it's going to have mega graphics.  Oh, it's unbelievable.  Are you going to be able to afford one of these Xboxes?  Oh, yeah, no doubt.  See, he'll get one.  Oh, yeah.  How are you going to get an Xbox?  You don't even have a job.  So, I go to the store and buy it.  With what money?  Money, man.  Green, dude.  Benjamins.  With a stolen credit card.  Of course.  We can't do that no more.  How do you make money on a vacation?  Oh, that's one of the secrets of...  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That's Shangri-La, kid.  Paul, what's up? 
[01:54:30]  Yo.  What's up?  I talked to you about them two girls yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  Let's change the subject.  Oh, them girls are ugly.  I went on their online site yesterday.  Woof.  Oh, the two girls we had in yesterday from Philly.  Yeah.  And, Paul, you're from Philly, so thank you for the little present yesterday.  Yeah.  It's like, I didn't send it to you.  Hell no.  Bastards from Philly.  I think we got some video and some pictures of what was going on in the studio.  Yeah, man.  It took me six hours of Baywatch to get that out of my mind.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Go to foundrymusic.com to check out the ugliness from yesterday. 
[01:55:00]  It was so ugly, my computer started crying.  Thank you, Paul.  Dude, I got to...  Can I ask you one big favor?  What?  Can you do that anthrax thing with the Don West today sometime?  Oh, yeah.  We'll try to get that in.  All right.  Thank you, man.  You're the guys.  All right.  Bye.  Dude, I got to disagree.  I'm not being pleasant.  I thought...  You know, I'd like to say awful things about people, but I thought those women were sexy  yesterday.  I'm not being...  Oh, my Jesus.  I think that's retribution for smoking weed and a stairway.  I ain't listening to a YSB.  No, I'm telling you that I really do. 
[01:55:30]  I'm not listening to your crap because about an hour and a half ago, you showed us your rod  from a crack...  The 50-year-old that called her Peggy.  But it was just the idea that she was such a dirty little Peggy.  That excited me.  She was a dirty little Peggy.  I didn't see dirty little Peggy, but I saw these girls, and I thought they were sexy.  Did the husband go on her, or did she go on the husband?  I'm here.  Oh, hey, Peggy.  Hey.  Hi.  Peggy, did your husband go on you, or did you go on your husband? 
[01:56:00]  Well, right now, I'm kind of high.  Oh, boy, I'm not going to get an answer from her, and I really want to...  He went on me.  Oh, okay.  He went on you.  That is a dirty Peggy.  Hold on.  Peggy said an hour ago that you don't do drugs anymore.  Well, these are legal drugs.  Oh, oh, what do you got?  The Vicodin?  No, we're stronger.  Stronger than Vicodin.  What are you taking?  What do you got?  Anthrax.  No.  Cipro.  What are you taking?  Uh, Valium. 
[01:56:30]  Ah, Valium.  Percocet.  Valium and Percocet?  Huh?  Valium and Percocet?  Yeah.  You are relaxed, ain't you?  Yeah.  You know what goes great with that?  I just can't do anything right now.  You know what goes good with that, Peggy?  Right.  A nice tall glass of scotch.  Right?  Well done.  Hello, Peggy.  If I may inform you on how to relax in your own home, as I do, Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly 
[01:57:00]  News, what you need to do is sit back with some Vicodin, a couple of Quaaludes, some Percocet,  and Peggy, just hop it off with a large glass of scotch.  I do this about 9 o'clock, about 9.20 or so on my chronograph.  How about a Heineken?  Heineken's are good, too, although I prefer a Michelolbe. 
[01:57:30]  Fabulous beer.  Weekends were made for Michelolbe.  Peggy.  I just better do anything like that.  Peggy, you sound like a hot number, and that Dan Rather has got, he's one up on me on  the anthrax.  If you have the clap, I love to A-penetrate you.  I didn't hear you, A-clap.  Exactly.  Hey, Peggy, why are you pill-popping?  Just to feel better. 
[01:58:00]  Feel better physically or mentally, Peggy?  When you're horny, you're horny.  Oh, my God.  This chick is out of her.  That's what my new closing line on NBC Nightly News is.  Tom Brokaw signing off, NBC Nightly News.  When you're horny, you're horny.  Tune in tomorrow.  God bless.  Whether you're horny or horny.  Peggy.  Yeah.  Do you take the drugs to relieve pain physically or mentally? 
[01:58:30]  Uh, mentally.  Thank God.  A little physically.  I love mental anguish and pain.  You know, to get through the, you know.  I don't take them, you know, thoroughly.  Hey, are you put together all right?  Or like, you know, what do you look like?  Describe your body a little bit.  Oh, God.  No.  Describe my body?  I told you before.  Well, no.  Do a better job.  Okay, I'm blonde.  Blonde.  No cups match.  Yeah.  You're blonde upstairs and downstairs? 
[01:59:00]  Oh, God.  Huh?  You're blonde upstairs and downstairs?  Yes, I am.  Cut it out.  Norton's.  Oh, my God.  Norton is actually as an angel.  Norton is working as an angel.  It's shaved in a heart for my husband.  It's shaved in a heart.  And now, what do you weigh?  About 106, 108.  Yeah, she said 4'11", 106.  106, and how tall are you?  About, I say 4'11", because... 
[01:59:30]  All right, what do others say?  4'11", and 3 quarters, so I say 5 foot.  Well, she's just under 5 foot.  I can get in all kinds of positions.  And you said you're a B cup?  Yeah.  And are you, are you, uh...  Are you, like, loose?  Are you all loose and hanging?  Right now, I am, but in general, I'm very open.  No, no, I mean, like, are you, are you, are parts of you...  The body's still tight. 
[02:00:00]  Has gravity taken its toll in an area?  No, I have nice, perky...  No, I have...  It hasn't grabbed yet.  All right, all right.  That's the upper region.  Now, around the lower region, does it, does it look like, uh, you know when you hand  a sugar cube to a horse and their lips start flapping like that?  Is that area down there resembling that at all?  No, it actually hurts.  Why does it hurt?  Okay.  Why does it hurt?  Well...  Did somebody punch you in it?  Well, the people I've been with, it's very painful. 
[02:00:30]  Now, I don't know if that's because their eyes are on my side.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Hold on, hold on.  I don't think that made the radio.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You didn't know one guy was even going at it because it was very...  Right.  Okay.  All right, listen, we have to take a break.  We're running really late.  All right.  Peggy, hold on a line.  We'll continue with you again after the break, okay?  We've got to get her to talk dirty to us.  Yeah.  Okay.  Are you ready to talk dirty to us, Norton? 
[02:01:00]  Well, if that's what you want, I was holding before, but I cut off.  Norton's ready, believe me.  No, stop touching yourself while you eat, man.  We've got to blow you off with David Wells, so...  Should I get my vibrator?  Yeah.  All right.  Yes.  Go pick it up.  Take it out of the drawer, honey.  How about...  Go dust it off.  How about what?  Guess what's in your hand.  No.  Well, you already told us.  You told us.  Well, how I can find something different?  No, it's a heart.  Just get your toys and we'll be back with you, Peggy.  Okay. 
[02:01:30]  I'm going to guess what's in your pants.  An Adelaide Stevenson for President button.  Dale from Jersey says, she's sporting a concrete floor.  Pull your pants down.  Can I see your taint whipped cream lesbian?  Can we see her butt?  Let me tell you about my balloon, though.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Radio's own slaggy.  Yeah, you're checking out The Opie and Anthony Show.  We got a drug addict on hold that wants to talk dirty to us. 
[02:02:00]  Nice, right?  We got a guy that hates the cops in the studio.  I don't...  Another fine Opie and Anthony Show today.  My opinions were taken out of context.  I have no pull or hate towards the New York City Police Department.  All right.  There you go.  That disclaimer will help you out on the way home.  Sure.  I got family that's dead.  Assistant District Attorneys.  I got cousins who are cops in the worst pieces in the city.  I am.  I give them their props.  You know what I'm saying?  All right.  But there's always that little bad apple scene. 
[02:02:30]  Thank God.  I'm dead.  Keep your thoughts to yourself next time.  Rabble rouser.  It's all about timing, my friend.  And you have really bad timing.  Peggy, what's going on?  You've gotten more uppity.  I'm not a drug addict.  Huh?  I'm not a drug addict.  Maybe a sex addict.  I'm not a drug addict.  You're not a drug addict.  See, Opie, you were calling her a drug addict.  Sex addict.  You're popping pills like M&M's over here. 
[02:03:00]  No, I'm not like M&M's.  You haven't given a Hummer since April.  What are you talking about, sex addict?  Yeah, whenever you had it.  Well, just because you don't get it from another partner doesn't mean you don't have it.  Well, she's got a point there, right?  She's saying that she doesn't have it with another partner.  But, what, you take care of yourself all the time.  Oh, oh, let's listen in.  What's that, Peggy?  Did you hear that?  Well, don't tell us what it is because they'll probably dump out of it.  Yeah, I can hear it.  Why don't you let that hit the phone a few times? 
[02:03:30]  Don't let it.  Let it hit the phone.  We've got to hurry up with this bit before you pass out.  I'm not going to pass out right away.  Come on, Belushi, rub it on the phone.  Oh, man.  Oh, jeez, just think where that's been.  Oh, my God.  Could you imagine the smell coming off the phone?  Easy.  Oh, jeez, man.  Isn't that awful?  Probably smells like a rotten yam.  How was that? 
[02:04:00]  Sexy.  Oh, that's so cool.  It goes to you, and it looks like you're banging two erasers together all the time.  Huh?  Peggy.  See, right now, I'm thinking Opie.  Thank goodness for that.  Peggy, all the names you could have chose.  All the names.  Oh.  Peggy?  Yeah.  I thought you passed out.  I didn't hear you.  No, I didn't hear you.  My phone's whacking.  Whacking?  Peggy, are you utilizing that device? 
[02:04:30]  Yes, I'm in my bedroom with my door shut in case my door just stops lying.  Oh, that's hot.  Oh, I mean disgusting.  Yeah, I know.  You get off on that.  Yeah.  I listen to your show.  I know what you get off on.  Ah, right?  And are you completely undressed, Peggy?  Well, I had my pants and my ankles and my thongs and my ankles.  Got the pen pulled aside? 
[02:05:00]  Your thong?  Yes.  How old is this woman?  She's fitty.  Let me see how you psychically relate, though.  What color are you?  I don't understand what you're saying now.  What are you going to say?  What color are my thongs?  Black.  Yellow and brown.  Oh, you're disgusting.  Yellow and brown.  Hey, uh...  Skid mark.  Are they black or red?  No.  Pink?  Yeah.  Oh, they're pink. 
[02:05:30]  Cute.  Pink, just like a little girl's...  A pink bar.  Oh, that must look like a Victoria's Secret ad.  Oh, God.  Yeah, I can be a little girl when I want it.  Victorian secret.  I can be a whore when I want.  Oh, jeez.  I don't want to get the eggs, fellas.  Your trousers are down to your ankles, are they?  Yeah.  Oh, it's all gooey.  Well, I can't, you know...  What?  Can't do it any other way.  Just in case... 
[02:06:00]  Just in case your daughter comes home, you want to be able to quickly, uh...  Yeah, the...  Yeah, I understand.  Pull your slacks back up.  Right, right.  All right.  Um, well, uh, go ahead and just, uh, do what you would normally do.  Well, I, I need a little more stimulation.  Well, you go stimulate yourself, Norton.  Oh, Jesus.  I don't want to get that...  I mean, have you ever watched Channel 70 or 71 or 9? 
[02:06:30]  Isn't that like...  What is it, HBO?  No, it's porno.  The O'Reilly Factor.  The 700 channel, kid.  Golden Girls?  It's porno.  It's the Spice Channel, right?  Right, right.  It's so...  No, it's porno.  Yeah, but it's soft core.  Hey, Peggy.  Yeah, but it's just enough where they pull things off that gets me off.  Oh, well, there you go.  Hey, Peggy.  Yeah.  Uh, picture Opie without a shirt.  Shut up.  I'd like to picture Opie doing a lot of things.  Well, hold on.  You got a story.  Hey, man.  Save me a book. 
[02:07:00]  And he's got his...  His cap is on backwards.  His blonde hair is dangling in front of his sweaty face as he's preparing to take you.  And he got a little goatee just rubbing on that old dusty cheek.  Like, let's...  What is that, her heart monitor I hear beeping in the background?  I don't know.  I don't know what that is.  You said you needed stimulation, so picture Opie without a shirt.  Shut up, Norton.  Joe had it.  And gently kissing your neck.  I don't know if Opie's into it. 
[02:07:30]  Yes, he is.  How about a nice bucket of eggs?  I'm trying to help you here.  He's kissing your neck gently in between wretches.  He's touching you.  All right.  My neck doesn't do it.  Is this working for you?  No.  All right.  How about this?  He roughly slid your trousers down to your ankles.  That'll do it.  He roughly slid them down without even unbuckling them.  And he removed your bloomers.  Yeah.  See, I'm into the slow removal or the forceful removal. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, he forced you down to the bed.  Oh, you like that.  Yeah.  Hold the hand.  Pull in the hair.  Pin you down.  Yeah, that type of thing.  Big handful of your gray hair in your hand.  Just pulling it.  No?  What are you, bald?  What are you, diet?  Oh, blonde.  That's right.  I told you.  Collar and cuff match.  Collar and cuff match.  I like her.  She's cool.  Blonde everywhere.  You're like handling.  He's handling himself. 
[02:08:30]  He's handling himself.  Norton, cut it out.  Jim.  Norton's playing rocket pool.  I think that's the two things opening that he's never had before.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Yeah, that's okay.  What'd she say?  She could do things to opening that he's never had before.  Opening, opening.  I know Kelly said that.  Peggy, remember, I had tongues my grandma once.  Oh.  No, this is a little spot between you know where and you know where.  The taint?  Oh.  What spot between what?  The taint.  On opening. 
[02:09:00]  On opening.  Where are you going?  She wants to eat your taint open.  To eat your opie.  What do you want to nibble on?  I don't know what you call it, but.  What spot?  Between the thing and the thing?  Right.  Between.  Now you want to nibble?  Yeah.  Right out of the shower.  Oh.  Now she's starting to feel it, right? 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hope he's black.  All right.  All right.  All right.  His goatee is dripping.  His whiskey.  Oh, that's it.  Peggy?  That was her phone dying.  Oh, isn't that a shame?  That was her phone dying out.  She's a good girl, man.  I like Peggy.  Oh.  50.  Wow.  Jimmy, just finish eating, dude.  You don't touch yourself.  Lapping.  Her phone, lapper.  Crapped out.  Thank God.  I'm hungry.  I want to eat dog food and lick your taint. 
[02:10:00]  Dude, take your hand out of your pocket.  Oh, my God.  Peggy, hung up.  Scott from D.C.  What's up?  She couldn't get wet at a Little Rock, Arkansas race riot.  What's up, Scott?  How you guys doing?  All right.  Hey, what's R.D.B. stand for?  Olive W. Bastard?  Hey, the sun's gone down.  It's time to go back to work.  Old Dirty?  Yeah.  Sun's down.  It's time to go back to work.  Hey, who was his English teacher?  Mike Tyson?  At least he's rapid fire. 
[02:10:30]  Dude, you are just...  just spitting my language to pieces.  It's embarrassing.  I don't care what color your skin is, but you sound like an idiot.  Are you implying that he doesn't speak the king's English, sir?  Dude, he doesn't speak English.  The king, you know, that's communicated.  It's a little bit of the Ebonics, I think, right?  Yeah, it's fine.  The Ebonics.  He's doing a little of the Ebonics for everybody.  Take that back to Ethiopia.  Oh, you got me. 
[02:11:00]  It's from the Dominican Republic.  Yeah.  I wish somebody would get you with a wood shampoo.  That kind of rhymes, sir.  Yo, dude, let me tell you something, man.  My name's not Dude.  It's Scott.  Yo, dude, like I said, Scott, dude.  And how do you spell something?  Yo, son, let me tell you.  Yo, I've been hit over that head with bats.  I've had battles of guns in my grill.  What you going to do, son?  What you going to do to fear me, punk?  If you give me a chance to hit you with a bat, I guarantee you I would hit a dinger that you'd never forget. 
[02:11:30]  Yo, dude, as a matter of fact, man, you talk so much, yo, dude.  Olive, dummy, bastard.  You're going to be talking that crap when you're on your bed.  I see you describing me, punk.  Yeah, whatever.  Sir, I would just encourage you not to say dinger again.  Don't say dinger.  I'm not saying you're not a tough guy, but dinger, never good in fight talk.  Not talking about that kind of dinger.  Oh, okay.  All right, Scott, thank you.  Later, guys. 
[02:12:00]  You pissed off everybody today.  I'm just a character, bro.  Oh, yeah.  Vic, what's up?  King Kong ain't got nothing on you.  What's up, Vic?  Yo, Owen A, you guys rock.  Hey, man.  It's just, dude, that was the nastiest crap I ever heard on the radio, ever.  That guy from D.C. yelling at Old Dirty?  No, that old lady.  Oh, the old lady, of course, yeah.  Who wanted to do something to Opie's taint.  That was disgusting, man.  Oh, my God.  Did you hear it?  She goes, right out of the shower. 
[02:12:30]  Just down there nibbling on it like it's a corn on the cob.  Oh, man.  Without her teeth in.  Oh, God.  You guys suck.  Oh, that is just awful.  That poor woman.  I love her.  You do.  I see you totally getting, like, aroused at this whole thing.  Yeah, Jason.  You dirty old woman.  Yeah, Vinny, what's up?  Hey, you know, Opie, I want to know.  Did you get bored with that woman?  No, not at all. 
[02:13:00]  No?  No?  No?  Nothing?  No.  How come?  Don't you like it, Opie?  Thinking of it as some kind of a Dean Wormer's wife from Animal House thing?  I would, Dean Wormer's wife was a, yeah, I would do her.  Yeah.  I wouldn't do this 50-year-old.  I don't know.  She might be sexy, Opie.  You don't know, she might have a great little body.  Dean Wormer's wife was a big-time turn-on.  Do you think so?  Yeah.  With the garters and stuff and the black stockings, I don't know. 
[02:13:30]  She kind of had a bunt going, those pointy boobs and that old bra.  She was a big turn-on growing up.  Yep.  First time I saw Animal House, without a doubt.  Cut the crap and get me a drink.  You knew she didn't get banged the right way for many years.  Oh, Dean Wormer wasn't taking care of her.  Yeah.  Dean Wormer stunk.  So, she's got to be taking care of Delta House.  But I never, ever thought that was attractive. 
[02:14:00]  I always felt that...  Mrs. Robinson was a turn-on.  Oh, no.  I just pictured it smelling like baby powder and byproduct of drinking fluids.  You're singing my song.  What's wrong with that?  I know.  See, I'm getting him going.  That's an annoying cocktail right there.  Mrs. Robinson and stuff, when you had that...  Well, what's her name?  Piece of ass there from the movie.  The young one.  That was her name.  Oh, yeah.  That was her name from that movie.  Yeah, get married at the end. 
[02:14:30]  She was cute to look at back then.  Wasn't that Mrs. Robinson?  That was Aunt Bancroft.  Aunt Bancroft was, yeah, Mrs. Robinson.  Yeah, let's get to the 90s, dude.  You been watching the news?  No, I haven't seen anything.  Anything new in the city?  Yo, Channel 2, man.  There's this news girl that comes on.  Her name is Whitney Casey.  You guys seen her?  Yeah.  Oh.  The Fox anchors are the best.  I like the Fox chick, but she looks like she never gets sleep, and that's kind of hot, too.  Who is that?  The blonde on the Fox News channel.  And she's always kind of got bags under her eyes. 
[02:15:00]  Like, she hasn't been sleeping.  Do you mean Paula Zahn?  And it's kind of called...  No, not Paula Zahn.  No, she's like...  She's a no-name chick for Fox, but she's hot.  And then that one that used to be on News 12 on Long Island, she's now somewhere else.  She's kind of hot looking.  She almost looks like that girl that used to sing The Kids in America back on MTV in the  old days, the blonde with the chapped lips.  She's hot.  If you want to talk hot news anchors. 
[02:15:30]  All right.  We better regroup.  Maybe Peggy will find another phone and call us back.  She's probably taking care of us.  I wonder if we're buying the 14-year-old away from us.  Have a drink.  I want to bang you.  This is normal radio, right?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I don't know whether the studio and listen to you guys have to drive down there and bash  your heads in with a baseball bat.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Patiently waiting for Peggy to call back. 
[02:16:00]  Our phone petered out.  Kevin, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Opie and Anthony, what's going on?  Hey, right, yeah.  Hey, listen.  I really think that old lady was really trying to figure out what Opie's age was.  By looking at the taint.  There are some older women out there that are freaky.  They're freaks.  Yeah, freaks.  We're going to have to have Peggy in the studio so we can take a look at her.  Definitely.  I bet she's not that bad for 50, you know what I'm saying? 
[02:16:30]  I think she has a horrendous voice.  She's got a pill-popping problem, but I think she probably doesn't look too bad for 50.  A body like E.T., right?  No, I think she's going to surprise a lot of people when she comes in here.  We know what we're expecting.  I mean, it's a 50-year-old lady, but I don't think it's as bad as you think.  And she's looking for a slamming.  Century sex every time you think of her, all right?  She's looking for some action, too, you know?  Some of these older women, it's a shame, you know? 
[02:17:00]  Something tells me, you know, that's something else.  She hasn't had it in a long time.  That's why I'm a little leery about maybe what she looks like.  Don't take much for a woman.  And 50 isn't old these days, you know, to go out, hang out in the right places.  She's getting it every night.  Some women can't do that, though, Anthony.  Why is that?  Because they just, they're uptight about it and they're afraid.  She doesn't sound uptight.  Or maybe about going out to meet guys.  She was with Oogie Pringle.  Enough said.  Oogie Pringle. 
[02:17:30]  Pete has an interesting story.  Pete, what's up?  Hey, Pete.  Pete, whatever your name is.  Yo, bro, you.  I hear his phone's there.  The 20-year-old.  That bangs the 45-year-old.  You.  He's probably listening to the radio.  Ah, some people don't know how to.  Looks like a good story, though.  Pete, what's up?  Cut my losses.  Oh, well.  Hey, Matt, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, what's up, ONA?  Hey.  Obscure reference.  Oh, do you have to be caddying in Westchester to get wood for an old lady? 
[02:18:00]  Ah.  Well, it's Long Island.  Huntington Crescent Club with John Shove.  Yeah, close enough.  It's New York.  That was a peach, hon.  Have a good one, guys.  I told the story.  I used to get wood on the golf course while I was caddying for the old broads.  Watching the old lady.  But that had nothing to do with the old broads.  It was just.  Oh, man.  I'm just going through, you know.  Yeah.  That, you know, what happens to the younger fellas.  Lugging the 75-pound bag, that always does it.  Yeah.  You don't understand why it pops up when it does, but it does.  It did.  But, like, back in height, there were certain times of the day where you sported wolf for no 
[02:18:30]  reason, dude.  Well, yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  It had nothing to do with the ladies.  For me, it was on the school bus when I would drive in.  And it wasn't really an emotion or anything.  I would just get on the school bus and, for some reason, would.  And then I'd get off the bus.  I'd have to hold my books in front of me.  And then we'd go away.  As long as it doesn't happen when the school bully is giving you a noogie.  Kind of embarrassing.  Yeah.  He has warm arms wrapped around your head.  I've got to try Pete again.  Pete!  Last chance, Pete. 
[02:19:00]  I know he's right there listening to the delay on the radio.  Dick.  Jim, what's going on, bro?  Yo, what's up, man?  You guys suck.  Thank you.  But I wanted to ask Tom Brokaw if he's using that longitude to get his mule bigger yet.  What am I going to do?  A commercial?  Come on.  You want to know about the longitude?  Yeah, I really do, man.  That's tough.  What is it?  Longitude?  Longitude.  I keep hearing these commercials every five seconds.  And they're like...  Oh, that's great.  Yo, get off the phone.  There's stuff to make your mule bigger, right? 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  Supposedly what it does, it doesn't make your mule bigger.  It just shrinks the rest of your body.  Do you have a small mule, bro?  No, I mean...  You're thinking about it?  It's decent, but it can always be bigger.  You've got to learn how to use what you've got.  Yeah.  Well, you know, it gets the job done, but if they guarantee an inch or something like  that, you know, what the hell?  I just want to know if it works and what the side effects are.  You ever hear of those guys that cut the tendon?  Yeah.  They have the tendon cut that, you know, when you're sporting the wood, you could feel that 
[02:20:00]  tendon there.  If you try to push down on it, look at Ben's holes in his ears, like, no, don't even talk  about it.  Basically, they can pull out an inch or two, like a vacuum cord, on you.  It's pretty much just cutting the tendon, and then the skin will stretch, but it's really  not right.  You won't get those that really point north.  It'll just kind of point straight.  Never heard of that one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what some people do.  They can pull a little more out of you there. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, but no one's calling up telling you if this stuff works or not?  I don't know.  I mean, these girls, these commercials drive you crazy.  Try it yourself.  99% of women are about that.  Watch that language, heart friend.  Sorry about that.  You know, I don't want to, if we took a poll with these ladies, I don't think that's true.  No, I don't believe that either, but, you know, if this stuff actually works.  What did they say, 98%?  Some crazy number like that, and it's every commercial, they're doing it.  I've heard women say both things with equal passion. 
[02:21:00]  Say size absolutely does not matter.  There was someone with one that was small, that was the best I ever had, and then there's  the ones that say, oh, my God, size so matters.  Don't even try it if you're small.  Yeah.  So, I think it's, you know, you leave it up to the girl.  Whatever she likes.  You get your lady off there, Jim, or what?  Well, yeah, you know, I go downtown and take care of that.  Nah, you got to be able to do it with the old brujol.  Yeah, what's up with that lady talking about that book that you had on a while ago? 
[02:21:30]  Oh, using it.  You never have to go down there anymore.  You just...  Oh, yeah.  We never learned what that was about.  Yeah.  We never read these books that these sexperts come and bring in.  That was the lady who came in and swore that she has a technique where, what, guaranteed  that the lady would get off every time?  Right.  Guaranteed, big O, every time.  The best one she's ever had, and it's through regular type sex.  Right.  You don't have to go down for treats.  You don't have to go downtown like that.  Dude, if a girl is worried about size, what has always worked for me is I just wrap my fist 
[02:22:00]  in a glad baggie.  Keeps the blood.  With some lard.  Dude, I can get a little messy, man.  Yo, dude, you don't like going down?  Downtown's all right, man.  Yeah, I like it down there.  Downtown's fine.  Yeah, that's really good.  It's clean and don't smell bad, you know?  Sometimes you're at the South Street Seaport, but, you know, it's all right.  I don't know who you're with there, Old Dirty.  The South Street Seaport.  Oh, my God.  No, downtown's fine.  Yeah.  It's great.  Yeah, I don't mind it.  It's nice, but then there's also, you know, being able to deliver the goods with just the 
[02:22:30]  standard, you know, sex act there.  And you guys are able to do that every time?  No.  Gotta flip.  Gotta flip.  Women love to be flip like pancakes, dude.  Flip like pancakes.  I somehow think that's going to turn up on what have we learned today.  Sex tips from Old Dirty.  Yeah, they like to be flipped and, like, raw, like a rough handle a little bit, right?  You gotta whack them in the back and the rear end.  Pistol whip them, Old Dirty.  Nah, nah.  Is that what you're saying? 
[02:23:00]  You gotta keep all guns out the bathroom, kid.  No mace involved in any of these hijinks, sexual...  It's about breaking out the, uh, breaking out a friend to help her out, you know?  After he's done, he breaks out something else.  Nah, you should be able to, you know...  Yeah, I mean, work your equipment.  Everything's fun to add into it, but when push comes to shove, quite literally, you have  to use, uh, your equipment to be able to, uh, to get results.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, I know I do.  I just...  Oh, sure.  Jim, what do you...  I mean, if you start, you gotta be able to finish. 
[02:23:30]  Jim, a lot of ladies wanna know what you're packing, cause there's a lot of paranoia in  your voice, man.  Yeah, I think he's under five.  What do you got?  Under five?  Nah, nah, it's like six and a half.  Huh?  Not bad, kid.  No, he likes that.  Kid.  Yeah, but that ain't too bad, though.  No, you should learn how to use it.  It's obvious you're not getting the job done.  I mean, I do all different kinds of, you know, positions and all.  You're thinking if it, you know, if I just only had a bigger one, that it would solve 
[02:24:00]  your problems.  Right.  Yeah.  Nah, maybe you're not moving it right.  Are you the one chump pump?  No, no, no, no.  One pump chump?  One pump chump?  Yeah.  Nah, you know, I go about 20 minutes or so.  You know what you do, dude?  This is the key.  What I do, cause I'm good for about eight, nine, even ten pumps sometimes.  This is true, and the women love this.  Yeah.  You don't wait for the area to be physically ready.  You don't wait for them to apply any type.  You just jump on and right in.  Really?  Yeah, and I put my face in their neck, and as I'm finishing, I sound like Luca Brasi being 
[02:24:30]  murdered.  That's what a girl likes.  No prep, no nothing.  Yeah.  No foreplay.  Then you tap her hand and shove a little knife to her.  Jesus.  No, you evil, bro.  Jim, good luck to you, all right?  All right, man.  Thanks a lot, guys.  You know something?  This guy Lou on line three brings up a great point, and this, I think, is why I get a little  skeeved out with women like Peggy.  Lou.  Yeah.  What's up, man?  Wait, wait, wait.  What's up? 
[02:25:00]  She's a nasty old...  I bet she's got dirty, callous feet.  Thank you.  I guess she's got bruised thighs.  You know something?  I'll tell you something.  I am not a guy who has a foot fetish at all.  I'm not like, oh, feet, feet, feet.  But if a girl has skanky feet, it is the biggest turnoff ever.  And, like, I just picture Peggy with corns and those big, thick, yellow toenails.  Sandpaper.  And, like, varicose veins all over them. 
[02:25:30]  Sharpening knives on them.  There is nothing better than a nice, tender, young foot.  Foot, yeah.  You know what I mean?  Actually, actually...  No, Norton, not that young.  Stop it.  I don't care if a chick's feet look like ham hocks with toxic waste on them.  Young feet scampering in a shopping bag in a bathroom stall.  Crinkle, crinkle, crinkle.  Crankled manner.  You don't care about, like, skanky feet? 
[02:26:00]  I don't care.  Big, gnarly toes and...  You see that tendons going to each toe from on top of the foot?  I would bang Dudley Moore with his club foot.  It doesn't bother me.  Who looks down that far?  But, yo, check it.  Don't worry about it.  You know something?  Because you are all...  When a woman is completely naked and she is laid out on that bed, you better be all over  that body from head to toe.  Because sometimes the feet is by your ears, you know?  There you go.  You got to look at that.  Right, old dirty.  When you're folding them in half like a garment bag, you got the feet of, like, you're staring 
[02:26:30]  at them.  Look, so that a woman that doesn't take care of her feet doesn't take care of her whole  entire, you know, the way that she looks and everything.  Big, thick calluses.  She could cut off a half inch with a razor blade and still not bleed.  I don't...  I'm telling you, I'm not a foot guy.  I don't care what the feet look like.  You don't.  As long as the rest of it is nice.  Yeah.  As long as the right area is clean and lovely.  I don't know.  Good cheeks.  Hey, Eric, what's up?  Meaty, maybe.  What's up, all in it?  Hey, bro. 
[02:27:00]  Hey, I got a visual for you on Peggy.  Yeah.  Remember that movie Kingpin?  I was just talking about that.  Yeah, the landlord that Woody Harrelson had to bang to pay the rent.  Ah!  Yeah, picture that.  I'll be picturing that all night long, thanks to you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You nailed it.  Thanks, Eric.  I think you shook something loose there, Tiger.  Gina, what's up?  I just had a comment.  It says size does not matter.  Yeah, I didn't...  Yeah, okay. 
[02:27:30]  I mean, I don't know about other women out there, but size doesn't matter to me.  I've had guys that are huge and have no idea what they're doing.  Hold on, Gina, but if, like, a guy, you know, gets naked and he has nothing, and I mean nothing,  that's got to be a real bummer.  It is, but if he knows what he's doing, that's good.  What if he's, like, hung like an acorn?  I'll do what I can.  Yeah, she'll try to deal with it, I guess, huh?  Yeah.  I mean, some guys just don't know what to do, no matter how big or small they are.  You just got to grab it between your thumb and forefinger and point your finger and just go... 
[02:28:00]  All right, so size doesn't matter.  There you go.  No.  To Jim in Washington.  All right, Gina.  Hi.  Doug from Boston.  Peggy probably has a Paul Maul in her mouth that she takes it in the A.  You just picture the fish eye look when she turns around with that red radish eye from 
[02:28:30]  the smoke going directly into it.  Hey, is it in there?  Come on, hook me up.  Radish eye.  Big red eye from the smoke going in there.  She's talking out of the side of her mouth.  Come on, big boy.  Take me home.  She's telling you stories about the Merchant Marines.  One time during Korea.  Hey, Jimmy. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, Ant, long-time listener.  Listen, I went out with a girl once, no joke, on my mother.  She looked just like Britney Spears, but there were two bad things.  She had man hands, like rough man hands.  That's like the summer-filled episode.  Oh, no joke, no joke.  When she grabbed you, the first time she grabbed me, I went, oh!  It was her, oh!  It went, oh!  Really?  And then we're in bed, and like, you know, she goes to rub her feet against you, like,  you know, it's like sandpaper.  Put lotion on them.  Put lotion on them if she's that hot, dude. 
[02:29:30]  Who cares?  No one sees her dumb feet.  I'm married now.  You know, my wife's hot.  It's kind of important, Norton.  I don't care.  It is, man.  The old D's with me, but you're like, you don't care of ham hocks with big cloafing  hooves.  Yes.  Satanic cloafing hooves over your head.  No, don't care.  For sure, God, pick me.  You're going to clean it out with a hoof pick.  You don't fully understand him.  I don't.  I'm not a hook guy.  He got a rod talking to Peggy.  Dude, I'm a dirty man.  He comes from a whole different place, this guy right here. 
[02:30:00]  Feet to me, I don't mind feet.  I'll suck toes.  There's nothing I won't.  You got a tumor, I'll lick it.  But I don't have a foot fetish, so I don't care.  I don't have a fetish either, but it's kind of important.  It's not like, oh, my God, I'm going right there.  But it's got to look nice, especially, I'm talking the whole package is laid out with  nothing on.  The whole thing's got to look good.  One false move, and it could screw the whole thing up.  Dude, I just like, as long as the cheeks, as long as the cheeks are solid. 
[02:30:30]  Okay, come down, Norton.  Cheeks, you can say.  Cheeks are not dirty.  As long as they're solid.  The rest of it doesn't matter.  Egg leg.  He wouldn't care.  What if the cheeks have a nice pimple on it?  I don't mind a little pimple.  That's realistic.  Maybe a thimple or two to show you who's boss.  To show you who's boss.  Keith, what's up?  Hello.  Hey.  Hey.  How are you guys?  Hey, man.  What's up?  I got to say for you, and it's a true story.  I was 18 years old, and every single Wednesday, I had this tutor, 60 years old. 
[02:31:00]  Her husband died about a year prior.  And she kept good care of herself.  And she looked like she was probably 50.  So I used to tell my friends that I knew she was horny.  And they dared me and dared me and dared me.  And so one day, I kind of was looking at her.  I touched her leg.  She looked at me, and I swear to God, she goes, do you mind that I'm 60?  And I said, I don't care.  And right there on her kitchen table, I did it.  I did the dirty with her. 
[02:31:30]  How was it?  You know what?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on, hold on.  Her boobs were what?  Decent.  They hung, but I'm telling you, they were decent.  And they did the job.  Was it a turn-on because you were so much older?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  And it went on for about three straight weeks until, literally, I got a little nervous because  she actually called me a couple times and asked me if I wanted to go there, not just  Wednesday nights, but Wednesdays and Thursdays.  So I said, can't do that. 
[02:32:00]  And I just stopped going altogether.  Dude, while you were making love, did you stare deep into her cataracts?  No, no, no, I didn't, but, you know, it was okay.  I was 18.  Would I do it now?  I'm 31 now.  All right.  Dude, you could have hustled the Social Security checks, kid.  Working off of something that Craig and Tom have on instant feedback.  Norton, would you be with an older woman that looked like the woman that came out of 
[02:32:30]  the tub in The Shining?  You know what?  No.  No, no.  I got to listen.  Just grabbing a handful of that old decomposing ass.  I have standards, but there's sexiness in women that is not, I mean, physical, yeah,  really important, but sexiness is a vibe, man.  It's like a woman who's like, say, I'm going to S your C.  That's really sexy.  Right, right.  That's a pretty little blonde who won't.  Okay, I can understand part of that, what he's got.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I got a whole thing, though, with like a visual on certain parts of a woman. 
[02:33:00]  Man is the visual animal.  Well, things got to look good to us.  Right.  You know, women go for the feeling.  Oh, I want to know your emotional side.  I want to see something tight, something nice.  And I'm not talking about a relationship.  That's something that's a completely different level.  I'm just talking your basic animal instinct.  Yeah.  I like certain things, man.  Man is a visual animal, dude.  The big private parts to be, can we say that, private parts?  Can we say private areas to just be thick and meaty and just really lesson teaching? 
[02:33:30]  I'm telling you, that's sexy.  They always show these little, these little, tight, like little alien mouths in the magazine.  You like them plump.  Plump.  Yeah.  Like they just went five rounds with Ali.  That's what I like.  Oh, my God.  When you smack them, they could make a popping sound.  There you go.  Yeah.  We're going to take a break and play What Do We Learn Next.  Wow. 
[02:34:00]  It's been educational today.  What an educational final 45 minutes we've had here.  A crazy day.  Well, you guys are both stupid.  You're like a black eye for all mankind.  I don't think they're very nice people.  The only way I could actually think they were funny was to be on Heroine, the Opie and Anthony show.  You know, I just like want to throw up.  The field of love.  And we're back with the O&A show.  Time to play What Do We Learn on the Opie and Anthony show.  You can use the instant feedback or you can give us a call. 
[02:34:30]  Let's get right to it.  Dan, what's going on today?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Today I learned if your mule is too small, you can always wrap your fist in a glad bag and stick it in.  That's what we've learned.  Can I tell you guys about a new sexual position real quick?  Yeah, go ahead.  Okay, it's called the Wayne Gretzky.  You ever heard of it?  No.  All right.  Just as you're doing a girl in the back door, right?  Yeah.  Just as she's about to reach, let's say, the climax point.  Right.  Your friend comes running out of the closet with a hockey stick and smacks her in the mouth, breaking all her teeth. 
[02:35:00]  All right, we're working on it, my friend.  Okay, fine.  That's soft.  Dave from Haverhill.  Math.  I learned that Opie's taint tastes best straight out of the shower.  That's what she said.  Carl, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I learned a lot from Norton today.  First off, I learned that he likes girls with chunt, which is WC.  All right.  Right.  WC.  Won't say it.  All right.  Girls with chunt.  And if I bring my grandmother to Rascal's sometime and sit in the front row with no panties, 
[02:35:30]  I'll get free tickets.  Well, there you go.  Thanks.  You guys suck.  All right, bro.  Thank you.  Cage from Columbus, Ohio.  What did I learn?  I learned some women think a hot dog torn down a hallway is okay, and David Wills will  never frequent a Hooters in Cleveland.  John from Pennsylvania.  Today, I learned that Jessica Tandy slept with Oogie Pringle.  Keith, what's up?  Hey.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned what I learned today that I learn every day. 
[02:36:00]  Had a noose bomb, always funny.  There you have it.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you.  Let's go to Patrick.  Patrick, what did you learn today?  Hey.  Hey.  I learned that Opie's taint is like eating a corn cob.  You bastard.  Thank you.  I also want to know if Norton would lick a tumor on Opie's taint.  No, no.  Norton would leave me alone, thank God.  All right, Patrick.  Tom, you're next on the O&A show.  Yeah, I learned chicks are like pancakes.  Every so often, you've got to flip them. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  Opie's in for a toothless taint massage when that chick comes into the studio.  Yeah.  And Oil Dirty now heads the NYPD's most wanted list.  No doubt.  No doubt.  You guys suck.  I begged the cops to, you know, go lightly on Oil Dirty when you see him in the streets.  He didn't know what he was saying today.  I apologize to the boys in blue.  You're the stupidest man alive.  M-I-O-P, stupidest man alive.  That's why you love me, kid.  Timing is everything and you have none of it.  I don't have a watch.  Craig, what's up? 
[02:37:00]  Hey, I learned today that Oogie and Pringle rhyme.  You're selling up for the cheap ones on the street, you bastard.  Oogie and Pringle rhyme.  Oh, go ahead, Craig.  What?  I learned that Oogie and Pringle rhyme.  Yeah.  I know.  That's true because she did say that the names rhyme.  The names rhyme.  Stinky rules.  Good pickup.  Good pickup, my friend.  Dan from Hoboken.  I learned Peggy banged Oogie and Pringle back when Rich Voss' jokes were new.  Oh!  And then he writes, but you know I love the guy.  Yeah, of course.  Matthew, you're next.  What did you learn? 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  I learned that no one would lick our tumor, but wouldn't grab a piece of ass from the  leading and the shining.  Yep.  You learned that.  Thank you.  Pringle knows to struggle.  I owe my daughter money.  I'm dodging her.  And Oogie, Pringle.  Oogie, Pringle.  I love the guy.  Stop.  Let's say hi to Amy.  Not many women calling us today.  I wonder why.  Amy!  Yeah. 
[02:38:00]  What did you learn today?  I learned that Osama bin Laden is actually a Hindu.  Yeah.  You said it, old dirty.  Well, they're all from over there, right?  He's not a Hindu.  Man, he just dropped the bombs, dude.  All right.  Thank you, Amy.  Thanks.  All right.  Glenn, the tool checking in.  Say, I learned that Norton doesn't care if a girl's feet looks like a ham hocks covered  in toxic waste.  And Oogie is not a shwoogie.  I did learn that.  Caroline. 
[02:38:30]  Hey, how are you?  It's Caroline, Brian.  Right.  I'm sorry.  I learned that when Ant is going downtown, he worries about his gag reflex and swallowing.  Right.  Hairball.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Orlando.  What's up, y'all?  I learned that performing oral treats on a hairy chick is like eating fish popcorn.  I think he rules.  That was a good one.  What up, bro?  I learned a little something myself today.  I learned that following the Oogie Pringle formula, Psycho Mark will kill himself in 2013. 
[02:39:00]  Norm, what's up?  Norm?  Hey, guys.  Hey, what's up?  I learned that Reverend Al's pocket pal's name in jail was Judy.  Yeah.  And that a dinger is never a good word to use in fight talk.  Never.  He kind of wimps out on him.  Freud has a few today.  All right.  Freud learned when O.D. doesn't shave for a few days, he begins to look Hindu-ish. 
[02:39:30]  Dinger is never a good fighting word.  Yeah.  Again.  And a pimple shows you who's boss.  I think we got this one already, but all right.  Chris, what did you learn?  Oh, guys, I learned a lot today.  Very educational.  Yes.  Peggy popped the Pringle.  She keeps her heart in her G-string.  She wants to nibble O.D.'s paint or opening.  Yep.  O.D. is getting a wood shampoo.  Yep.  Girls like a guy who sounds like Luca Bracci getting killed. 
[02:40:00]  Jody has eggs for boobs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Very good on the Jody thing.  Yeah, go ahead.  I learned something yesterday.  Yeah.  When you want girls, Philly sends you a zebra.  Hey, listen.  Can you guys do me a favor?  Yeah.  Play that Carol Miller sound effect that brings back old memories.  Yeah, that one.  Long story, guys.  I'll call you again sometime and explain it.  All right.  Call.  Bye. 
[02:40:30]  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Later.  Days from New York.  I learned six and a half is okay, kid.  Oh, God.  Yeah, let me go to Uncle John.  Uncle John, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  I learned two things.  I learned that O.D. is hated by the police nationally.  Yeah.  And I also learned that people in Dallas enjoy breaking news about six hours later.  That's true.  Take care, guys.  Thank you.  See you next Tuesday. 
[02:41:00]  He's checking in saying today.  I learned that sometimes a girl just has to grab it between her thumb and forefinger and  go.  Andy from South Jersey.  I learned old broads.  Dig Opie, Victorian secret.  Always funny.  When you're horny, you're horny.  Actually, that's from the guys at FMQB.  Listening to the show.  I learned David Wells loves that there's a delivery McDonald's in New York.  Boy, that guy was busting apart all the rumors about him.  He loves to go out and drink.  And the last thing I think David should be doing is sitting at home getting McDonald's 
[02:41:30]  delivered to him.  You know what I mean?  Come on.  He's the real deal.  Oh, yeah.  Sal from the NYPD.  What's up, my brother?  Sal?  Sal.  Oh, I gave you the big intro and everything.  And you're not saying...  Hey, he screwed it up.  Sal?  He learned that O.D. is on his hit list.  Oh, dirty.  Anybody got a used bulletproof?  You're in bad shape.  A little body armor.  All right. 
[02:42:00]  We're just about done.  Yeah.  I'm just a cat.  Pat, what's up?  Hey, I learned that everybody that listens to Opie and Anthony like country music during  the commercials.  That's in San Francisco, those idiots.  Oh, yeah.  Rick's a fag.  All right.  Thank you.  No problem.  Frankie from Philly.  I learned CNN is run by sluts and bastards, and two old ladies' thongs are always yellow  and brown.  Paul E. saying he learned David Wells is a bigger whore than Norton, and on vacation is 
[02:42:30]  a code word for drug dealer.  Holy crap.  No bones from Jersey.  See, after seeing those two ladies you had in the studio yesterday, I know why they call  Philly the city of brotherly love.  Well, they came from Philly, yes.  Because you'd rather suck a D than be with either of those two skanks.  Oh, my God.  The video from their appearance is up on foundrymusic.com.  Yeah, check it out.  It's frightening.  I'm surprised it took so long to get their video up. 
[02:43:00]  Wow, what happened here?  I lost my headphone.  If the chick that you're banging gives you the Paul Mall fisheye, it's time to rethink  your pickup lines.  Ah, you like it back there.  The Paul Mall fisheye.  How you doing?  Big, like, old lady red lipstick around the end of the cigarette.  And you smell a little Bengay-y.  Bengay and, like, old lady perfume. 
[02:43:30]  Ooh.  And pantyhose smell.  Well, I'd, uh, I'd like to stay and play with you boys, but I got a hockey game to go to.  Yes, you do.  Islander Rangers.  I think I'm in gold tonight, so I got to get to the Coliseum.  Will you be behind me in front of the net today?  Yeah, I think they're going to throw me in there for a few minutes tonight.  Give it a try.  So I'm heading out.  As we leave, can we give away all four?  Two.  All right, we got a couple pairs of tickets to see the New York Islanders versus the  Montreal Canadiens at the Coliseum on Thursday, November 27th.  Obviously, we'll give these tickets to someone in New York or the Philly area, okay? 
[02:44:00]  And Bill checking in, saying, don't degrade Zebra like that.  They were more like the Stanton Anderson fan.  Long Island reference, but very funny.  And with that, we'll see you guys tomorrow.  We have an action-packed show tomorrow.  Trust me on that one.  We'll have the details at three.  One, two, three, four, three.  Oh, it's naked girls.  Oh, it's naked girls.  Turn, turn, turn it off.  Turn, turn, turn it off.  Oh, it's porno. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, it's porno.  It's not good for you.  It's not good for you.  Who else gives you porno and comedy at the same time?  A stupid program called the Opie and Anthony Show. </pre>
