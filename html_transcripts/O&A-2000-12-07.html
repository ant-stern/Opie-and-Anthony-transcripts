<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with comedian Brian Regan as a guest.  The conversation started with a graphic recounting of a previous show's stunt involving listeners eating cooked rats, prompting dark humor from Regan.  The hosts then repeatedly promoted Regan's upcoming shows at Caroline's Comedy Club,  but struggled to agree on the exact showtimes.  Their upcoming Christmas party was discussed, featuring a planned game involving enemas and a kiddie pool, and a guest flown in from Sweden. The arrest of fifteen people connected to the show for operating a "Voyeur Bus" with nude women was mentioned, with the producer's pre-arrest comment, "This is legal, isn't it?", highlighted.  Regan's experiences with the internet and chat rooms were touched upon before a Cablevision high-speed internet commercial break.

Following the break, the conversation included listener anecdotes about Regan's shows (involving rat-themed signs),  details about the hosts' Penthouse magazine interview (and their families' reactions), and the difficulty of obtaining Regan's CDs. A caller previewed an upcoming news story about the Voyeur Bus, sparking further listener calls. Regan shared a story about filling in for a hypnotist, resulting in audience confusion.

The chaotic energy escalated with the arrival of Sandy Kane, a comic stripper, who performed a suggestive act involving a dildo on air. This led to further ribald conversation and the unexpected appearance of Jay Moore, a film actor, who was also plugged throughout the show.  A caller, Phil, applied Preparation H ointment to Kane's hemorrhoid on air, resulting in prolonged, vulgar commentary and physical actions.  The segment continued with more listener calls, further promotion of Regan's shows, and off-color jokes focusing on bodily functions and sexual innuendo.  The entire broadcast maintained a highly informal and vulgar tone, filled with interruptions, tangents, and crude humor.  Throughout the broadcast, numerous callers phoned in with a mix of comments about Regan's act, unrelated requests, and observations.  One memorable caller inquired about the proper method for microwaving Pop-Tarts, leading to a humorous discussion about the absurdity of the Pop-Tart instructions.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Bring in Brian Regan. He's playing Carolines all weekend, I'm telling you, man.  We go every time he's in town, we laugh our yam bag.  No pesky networks to get to on this show, Ron and Fez.  There he is.  Hey.  Brian, how you doing, man?  Doing great, how are you?  Good. Good to see you back.  You know, last time, if I recall, last time you were on our program, we had a fun little show.  It was Rat Day.  It was Rat Eating Day.  The Year of the Rat on the Opie and Anthony show.  That was great, man.  We had people in here eating cooked rats. 
[00:00:30]  That's right.  For, you know, Survivor. Everyone was doing the Survivor.  Nice, yeah, I remember that.  We can't even do the bit justice.  No, it was so bad.  I mean, the rats came into the studio live.  Subway? Were they subway rats?  Yeah, they were big, gnarly rats.  They were huge.  They were like from another planet.  Yes, huge.  They were frightening.  So they had to be put under and then skinned.  Put under?  You make it sound like you gave them a little needle, made them count backwards from a hundred.  And he woke up and got ice cream. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah, you don't want to say they were killed.  He was clobbered over the head with a meat tenderizer.  The rats are no longer with us.  Yeah.  Brian, the only reason I put it that way is because I'm staring at your lovely wife there.  And I didn't want to, like, offend her.  Oh, that's very nice.  You should know that the rats had a pretty brutal death.  Oh, you beat them to death?  It was horrible.  And in the middle of this whole thing, we're going, Brian, you got some material on this, right?  Right.  We're hoping that Brian can make people laugh.  Do your 20-minute chunk about rat death. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, the rats thought Mussolini got off easy in the town square there.  What?  That's pretty much it.  What's with these rat sandwiches?  Why is it every time you're trying to slaughter a rat, they put up a fuss?  It's getting to where you can't even skin a live rat anymore without people getting all bent out of shape.  Then they were cooked and eaten by some of our listeners. 
[00:02:00]  They were competing chefs.  You had two different chefs that were each trying to prepare them in their own succulent,  different ways.  We had the French chef and the Jeffrey Dahmer guy.  Yeah, this French chef prepared it with some kind of,  I am making this rat au poivre.  This is going to be wonderful with a black pepper sauce.  And the other guy's like,  I'm going to put it on a stick and roast it on an open socket.  Like he didn't even have a cooking utensil.  He's like he's plugging the rat into a wall. 
[00:02:30]  He said, I can stick his tail into this socket here.  He'll cook.  Believe me.  My wife went this way.  This guy was insane.  Did you guys eat him?  I didn't eat him.  No, no.  That was insane.  No.  That was the day we knew Brian kind of liked our show.  Because like Brian, listen man, you can leave whenever you want.  He goes, no.  Oh, I got another two hours to kill him.  That was awful.  I got like a sick side to me that just wanted to enjoy.  There were actually, you had listeners that came in to eat the rat. 
[00:03:00]  You know, and I'm thinking there's going to be either zero or one lunatic out there.  We go out in the waiting room.  There's like, you know, 15 guys all milling around, you know.  Can I eat the rat?  What do I got to do?  How do I get in the front of the line?  Is it cooked yet?  Scrumptious.  A watched rat never cooks.  So welcome back to the show.  Yeah, welcome back to the show.  We're looking forward to seeing you.  Caroline's.  Always, always a brilliant set.  Yeah, we won't be there tonight because we have our Christmas party. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, right.  Those are always fun.  You should join us after the Christmas party.  Maybe you're doing the early show tonight, right?  I think you've got one show.  Yeah, one show.  Eight o'clock.  I'll call it early or late.  It's the show to see you.  The early only show.  I don't know what kind of time thing you want to put on here.  I think they call it the eight o'clock show.  Wow.  That's ouch.  That's both early and early.  Right.  It's kind of right in between there.  I mean, for toddlers, wow.  That's a late show.  That's a late show for the toddler. 
[00:04:00]  They've got to be in bed like it's seven.  So for them.  They're going to be sitting in there going, I can't stay awake.  Let's say there were two shows.  What would this be considered?  Thank you.  Well, take Friday, for example.  They have an eight o'clock show and a 1030.  Therefore, the eight is referred to as the early show.  Right.  Actually, I don't know what time the shows are Friday and Saturday.  It is.  Probably the Caroline's people going, those aren't the show times.  Doesn't he know how to plug a weekend?  What is he doing?  No, I checked it out. 
[00:04:30]  It is eight and 1030.  1030 Friday and Saturday.  Friday and Saturday.  Okay.  And then only one show.  One show on Sunday.  To really confuse people now, Sunday show is at 930.  Oh, really?  I didn't see that one.  Is it?  Yeah, it's at 930.  Tonight, I can go to the Sunday show.  Tonight's one show at eight.  Sunday's one show at 930.  Unless you're in New Zealand where it's Friday right now.  We should just completely.  I think there's a 745, but the Central Time show is at 815.  And then at 340, it takes about an hour drive.  So on Saturday with the third show, when they do add it, it's at midnight. 
[00:05:00]  But then the Sunday, which is now 930, used to be 815.  And tonight's show, therefore, is 8 o'clock.  Or then the joining flight out of Cleveland.  That's right.  You have to make the connection, of course.  A little slower.  Let me get this.  And people out there, you know, I was going to go, but after this headache.  Well, we're going to miss tonight, but we're going to go tomorrow, Brian.  I want you to know that.  Cool.  Because we're going to be on the Ron and Fez show tonight after our Christmas party when we're really tanked.  Now, you're invited to come in. 
[00:05:30]  Where's the party?  Right here.  Right here.  Right here.  We've got enemas.  Brian, case closed.  I'm here.  Brian, listen to what these six experts are doing tonight.  I think this is a TV show in Sweden.  So a guy's coming in.  We're actually flying him in for this.  He's taking an enema, and he's going to stand in the kiddie pool.  Everybody gets to tell him a joke.  And whenever he drops his ass, that guy wins.  You'll know when you're the funny guy.  Yeah. 
[00:06:00]  I'm hearing, you know, ONA saying all week how you're the funniest man alive.  I think Regan could be the ringer.  You somehow blew best G. David Howard.  Last time I saw Regan without an enema, I crapped myself in the seat at Caroline's.  Well, you were sick.  I remember that.  You were on the cusp to begin with.  What I want to know is why the guy has to be flown in from Sweden for this.  You know, isn't there a guy, like, down the road you can grab?  I can't tell you how good his agent was. 
[00:06:30]  We just fell for the whole thing.  Yeah, we want him.  We get people to eat rats and stuff.  You'd think somebody could accept an enema.  Maybe he's the pro guy, though.  If you want to take an ONA listener and let them come in.  No, that's okay.  You wouldn't want to see what comes out of that.  Probably a rat.  Is it your Stalker Patty?  Is it your Angel Amy?  She might do it for rent.  Stalker Patty's right outside the studio.  Did you hear her hard story?  No.  She's going to be homeless on the 31st.  She has $100 a month for rent, and she wants to live in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. 
[00:07:00]  You know where she should live is in 1931.  A really nice place for $200 of available rooms.  Sure.  I'd love to see her.  When you put in the search, though, on the Internet, when you're looking for homes, I haven't seen the year, you know?  What year are you looking for?  Boy, that would be a plus.  You've got a big place, right, aren't you?  No, not that big.  You've got the tree house.  You could get lost in one of those rooms. 
[00:07:30]  I know you've got a big couch.  I'm going to offer up your office if you don't shut up, Ron.  You've got it.  Hopi's apartment is like, you ever been to the Swiss Family Robinson house at Disney?  Yeah.  I swear to God, it's just like it.  There's stairs that go nowhere.  There's like these little cubbyhole rooms where, like, elves and gnomes live.  It gives me plenty of places to hide.  I guess so.  It's like you go up the steps, and there's just like a brick wall there or something.  That's where they hid, like, Anne Frank, right?  One of those kind of doors.  Yeah, the Anne Frank house.  Anne Frank up in his attic. 
[00:08:00]  So Patty could stay there.  That's Ali painting.  Fez has that, but he has the Barney Frank house.  Oh, yeah.  The Barney Frank diary.  Diarrhea.  Yeah, that's a little different.  A lot of people want to check in.  Al, real fast, we've got Brian Regan in the studio playing Carolines all weekend long.  Al?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, I just want to let Brian Regan know, if he plans on making any of his shows this weekend,  stay off the bus.  Noted.  Yeah.  Well, I guess we've got to explain something. 
[00:08:30]  I'm the only guy that doesn't get what this guy's talking about.  And we're all pointing at it.  Absolutely stay off the buses.  Brian, we haven't seen you in a while.  Well, thank God you weren't here last Thursday, because 15 people associated with this very  here radio show got arrested.  Got arrested.  Oh.  Yeah, that was a fun day.  That was good.  We had something called the Voyeur Bus, and it drives around the city.  It's got glass sides on it.  It's totally visible to everybody inside. 
[00:09:00]  Full of nude girls.  And you drive it through the city, because it's legal.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, we thought so.  And we had a couple of people, Louis Black from Comedy Central.  Right.  He was on the bus.  He was nude?  Yeah.  Completely nude.  That's where we effed up, because that is illegal.  To have nude comics.  There's a very explicit stat shoot against Louis Black being nude.  And he was arrested with other people on the bus, and the girls, and taken into custody 
[00:09:30]  for 28 hours, where he had to go to the tombs and stay in jail.  So how far did you guys analyze this legally?  When you say, hey, it's legal, you know, I don't see any legal law books in here that  you guys were consulting.  Yeah, the law of books like L.A. Law.  You just assume it's legal until they get arrested.  Sorry, we thought it was legal.  We thought it was in a bus.  I got the clip of our producer, Rick, just when the S was hitting the fan.  Yeah.  Check out this really quick quote, Brian. 
[00:10:00]  This is legal, isn't it?  That's the title.  It's a cop.  He said that right before they cuffed him.  Yeah.  That's what you want your defense attorney to say when he stands up and it's his turn.  Well, this is legal, right, Joe?  Right, isn't it?  Can we check now?  No, it's not.  Okay, well, then I rest my case.  What a mess that was.  Yeah, so stay off the bus, I guess.  Yes, I will.  I don't think you'd have gone on the bus in the first place.  Well, I was on a bus nude today, but they didn't have the glass windows or nothing. 
[00:10:30]  That's where we effed up.  But that's legal, I think.  I think it's legal, isn't it?  That's how I live my life.  It's legal, I think, philosophy.  Yeah.  This barnyard animal, this is legal, isn't it, officer?  For me to be with it at night in a motel?  It's legal, I think.  Sure.  This is legal, isn't it?  He was panicked.  It was so funny.  Well, not to him. 
[00:11:00]  It was funny because we weren't there.  Yeah, we were going to go on the bus, but we decided against it.  So did everybody on the bus get hauled down?  Everyone got hauled down, 15 people, all of them.  Girls, the guys, everyone arrested.  Just another day on the fun-filled show.  Who knew?  We thought it was legal.  Well, why don't we take a break, Brian Regan in studio?  Playing Caroline's, wow, many shows with many different times.  We'll get all the times and dates straight. 
[00:11:30]  I think he just started five minutes ago.  They're looking for him.  Why don't you call Caroline's, 212-757-4100.  Brian Regan at Caroline's, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  And we'll be back with him next.  Hey, Anthony, the cable modem from Cablevision.  Yes, Opie.  Did you get yours yet?  No.  You think Brian Regan does that surfing?  That web surfing?  How are you with the internet?  Do you surf the web there?  Are you savvy, Brian?  I wouldn't say savvy. 
[00:12:00]  I've been on the internet.  You know?  I was just going, no.  No.  I've been on it.  That's great.  I've been through the internet.  You've been on.  You've been on the information highway, huh?  Hang in ten.  What do you do?  A few tricks and then you get off?  I don't know how to get out when I'm in there.  I've used an ATM.  Something.  Yeah.  No, you've got to get wired to it.  It's the net.  It's the future.  Yeah, I don't.  No.  I went in one chat room one time. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, those are the bad things.  And I wanted to make sure I didn't go into one of those scary ones, you know, that's really dirty or anything.  Right.  Because I didn't know anything about it.  So I go to, like, you know, like news, you know, current events, you know?  Yeah.  So I go in there.  I go in there.  I don't even, like, say anything, you know?  I don't click on it.  I don't say anything.  I didn't realize that your name pops up on a screen.  So, like, within three seconds, I got, like, nine emails going, hey, you, I know what you're into.  And, you know, email me back.  And I'm like, what? 
[00:13:00]  It's current events.  How do you know what I'm into?  Yeah.  That's because every room is just a filthy, dirty, nasty room.  No matter what the title is, you know?  Yeah.  It could be the most wholesome, you know, helping people out.  Yeah, I know how to help you out.  Mother Teresa.  That seems safe.  Oh, and her daughter.  What the hell is this?  And a glass bus.  New.  Totally nude.  Totally nude radio.  Yeah.  Well, if you're going to get on the internet, you don't want to go with these 56K modems. 
[00:13:30]  You know?  See me?  Look at me.  I'm flying.  Why don't we ask him what a 56K modem is?  Oh, OB.  Do you know, Brian?  Yeah, 56 is, you need to get something higher.  You need to get to, like, 57, 58.  Right.  Once you're at that level, then you're moving.  It's more gooder.  More gooder.  More gooder.  The cable modem's more gooder than the 56K.  Cable modem.  You got a cable coming into your house, you have access to the Cablevision and Optimum Online 
[00:14:00]  cable modem, high-speed internet access, 100 times faster than any 56K connection.  100 times faster.  That's quick.  Not just 57, 58.  There'll be downloads.  You could get more perverts per minute telling you what you're into with this connection.  No waiting.  No, none of these pictures scrolling down slowly.  The disgusting pictures of wine bottles in various places.  No.  No.  And it's four times faster than DSL, whatever that is. 
[00:14:30]  Right, Brian?  I wouldn't mess with that.  Not when this is available.  Yeah.  And how's this?  A holiday offer.  Come into the Wiz right now and spend $100 on anything, even gift certificates.  You get a free high-speed cable modem when you sign up for 24 months of Optimum Online.  $200 cable modem.  OP.  Free.  Huh?  Free.  What?  Free.  You could even go home and try Optimum Online free for 30 days.  If you don't like it, return it for a full refund, but I doubt you will.  It's so fast.  You can go back to your old lame service, but I'm telling you, you won't want to.  Hmm? 
[00:15:00]  So what are you waiting for?  Go to the Wiz now and get Optimum Online from CableViz.  It's kind of like a car wreck on the highway.  You're going to have to tune us in to see what the hell these idiots are doing next.  Bobby and Anthony.  We refuse to be responsible.  So go screw yourself.  We refuse to be responsible.  1-0-2-7.  W-N-E-W.  We're very happy today.  We've got one of our favorite guests in the studio, Brian Regan.  He's playing Carolines all weekend long, starting tonight through Sunday. 
[00:15:30]  Call Carolines for ticket info.  Yeah.  It's completely worth it.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-100.  They will sell out fast, so call now.  Last time Brian was in town, he was talking about some of our listeners and how they show  up to his shows with the clients, Anthony.  Well, yeah.  Some of them.  Oh, it's...  They do, yeah.  Well, actually, when I was...  Last time in town, after the rat show, people came out and they, you know, had written down  things on, like, these poster boards, you know, eat rats, or...  One person just had a... 
[00:16:00]  They just wrote rats.  And what would, you know, make somebody want to, you know, hey, you know, you were talking...  I've got to go buy a poster board and write that word down, because that was the topic.  Or it's like if they do have a little thought, you know, are you going to eat rats?  It's like, this is what I'm thinking.  So I have to write it and hold it over my head.  This is my current thought.  I want everyone to know what my current thought is. 
[00:16:30]  I might have another one next week, and I'll write it down.  Yeah, that's them.  You know, it's like those people, you know, down in Florida, you know, you know, gore is  a moron.  Oh, yeah, the protesters.  You know, it's like, you got anything else to do with your life that, you know, you come  up with, it doesn't even rhyme.  You know, I would think if you got to write something on a poster board, it should at least 
[00:17:00]  rhyme.  You know, you have to go to jail or something.  Something catchy.  You can't just write something that doesn't even rhyme.  It isn't catchy in any way.  Gore more gooder.  Gore more gooder.  No, you, to you, Bush.  Person, no.  Why are you writing that down?  Oh, boy.  Yeah, that is a true cluster F down there anyway.  And I'm so sick of it.  Like, there's nothing on the, and they keep covering it as the top story. 
[00:17:30]  And they don't cover the important stories like Voyeur Bus Busted on Broadway.  That upsets us.  Oh, man.  Well, you should tell Brian about our little penthouse interview, Anthony.  Ah, yeah.  Yeah.  We were in penthouse.  Wow.  Latest issue of penthouse, Brian.  Yeah.  Big interview.  Yeah.  I have to pretend like I don't know anything about it.  Yeah.  Like we weren't just talking about it during commercial break.  Oh, really?  Throw some acting skills in.  Are you serious?  You're in a recent penthouse issue? 
[00:18:00]  That's fantastic.  I bet it was awkward at grandma's for Thanksgiving when you had to show the family.  Why don't you tell me about it?  If that indeed happened.  I don't know.  I don't know because we're talking about it right now for the first time.  That's great.  So they ask you questions and everything?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Certain questions.  No, actually, we're urinating on each other like every other picture in penthouse that they do. 
[00:18:30]  It's quite the pictorial.  Quite steamy.  We're right after the fisting pictorial.  Yeah.  Which made my dad and my mom very proud.  I got an email, as a matter of fact, from these people that have a message board from...  That's on the internet there, Brian.  I'm out of the loop on this topic.  ...from the old high school I went to.  And it was somebody all pissed off because the post was a former student in penthouse. 
[00:19:00]  And the guy was all pissed that it was me.  Wow.  Because when you think of a former student in penthouse, yeah, you could go through quite a few people before you got to me.  Right.  You know, like maybe the cheerleading squad or something.  The girl, Anthony, they want to see you in penthouse.  Now the odds of another person from school being in penthouse are, like, astronomical.  You ruined it.  So now, you did show this to your grandmother.  Yeah. 
[00:19:30]  At Thanksgiving, we had to go to our family's houses and open it up to the appropriate page.  And I told grandma it was a copy of Highlights magazine where you have to, you know, color and fun kid stuff.  It's like when the CIA releases documents, but they black out, like, 97% of the words, you know.  These CIA documents are like, rocket, important, go, rocket.  Why are you even bothering releasing this?  You got to, like, show your grandmother, you know. 
[00:20:00]  Opie and Anthony, show, radio.  Hey, that's a good article.  I'm proud of you, grandson.  Every other page is just black.  Black, all blacked out.  We couldn't show it.  And then the kids, of course, very excited that, you know, the uncle brought over a penthouse magazine for Thanksgiving.  Someday, we're hoping to be in a magazine where we could just throw it down and people could check it out instead of having it in a paper bag.  Like a sneaky.  Yeah, bring them into the other room so they could get a peek. 
[00:20:30]  We're really gunning for swank or chic.  One of those.  Horrible.  There's a guy on the line that has a question for Brian.  Vinny, what's going on?  Yeah, how are they?  Hey, hey, Vinny.  Brian Regan, he's hilarious.  I want to know where I can get his information or anything.  He gets his CD on the Internet or his website we can go to.  This guy, I could probably hand out ten of them for Christmas.  Yeah, Brian, I mean, your CD, one of the hardest CDs to find.  Seriously.  I'm probably like the worst marketer in the history of, well, you got to go to Ohio. 
[00:21:00]  There's a little warehouse.  It's not in a major city.  It's in the suburbs of Cincinnati.  All right, what's the street?  This guy will go.  It'll go in a second.  I'm telling you.  No, actually, they have it in certain record stores.  I've seen it in borders, like Music and Record Store.  Music and Record.  Music and Record Store.  We put it on the Victrola and listen to Brian Regan. 
[00:21:30]  Crank it up, because you got to use the crank.  Get enough juice generated so we can get through one Brian Regan thing.  But you can also go to, like, Amazon.com and just where you type in the name of the person.  You just put my name in there and it'll pop right up.  Right in front of the pickle barrel at Olsen's Mercantile.  All right, let's go to Bud. 
[00:22:00]  Hey, Bud, you're next on N.A.W.  Yeah, how you doing?  Excuse me, I'm eating dinner.  I just saw on Channel 2 News, they're going to have an upcoming story about the voyeur bus.  The title is First Amendment Rights.  Ah, there they are.  Yeah, Channel 2 News.  All right.  It was on about two minutes ago, and it's quarter after five.  All right, thank you, Bud.  That's cool.  Catch you later.  They're still doing stories on the voyeur bus.  Giving us updates.  My favorite part of that call was the fact that he was eating dinner.  And he had to tell us.  He had to tell us that. 
[00:22:30]  Every caller, when they call in, you know, I'm eating a candy bar.  Okay, my question is...  I'm thinking about eating, a little hungry today.  What I want to ask?  A little bit later, I might get some Chinese food.  You guys, how long have you been on the air?  This is not what I'm used to.  Yeah.  Remember that?  Yeah.  Wow.  You were like one of our first guests.  Yeah.  On this show.  You came in when everyone still hated us. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  There's a lot of people that still hate us, but I mean, everyone hated us back then.  But those calls were fun.  Yeah.  You know, it's like, hey, we got Brian Regan fan on the phone.  I lied.  You suck.  Get off the air.  Brian, I love you, though.  But you guys suck.  Play some CCR.  Whenever you're replacing anybody, you know, it's like people are used to something the  way it is, and you're different from their schedule, so this isn't what I'm used to.  I one time did a show, and nobody even told me.  I was like filling in. 
[00:23:30]  I do my whole show.  Nobody really laughs.  I get off stage.  I look.  On all the tables are these table tents saying, you know, the amazing, you know, some guy's  name, hypnotist.  Oh, no.  Everybody was there to be hypnotized.  You know, I never got around to hypnotizing anybody.  How is he going to hypnotize?  You know, people coming up after the show, how come you didn't make us act like chickens?  You would think the booker would have said, hey, keep in mind, they're expecting a hypnotist.  You might want to say something in your first two minutes. 
[00:24:00]  That you're not the hypnotist.  I wanted to sing like Madonna.  Oh, boy.  We have, what's her name here?  Outside.  Didn't she first stop by?  I saw some of the looks on people's faces.  Are we really going to bring Sandy Cain in?  Who do we have?  Sandy Cain.  Yeah.  Just stay over on this.  Just stay over on this side.  No, no.  It's okay.  I think.  Actually, yeah.  Is that Brian's jacket?  Yeah.  You might want to move it.  Yeah.  I don't know what type of parasites or anything. 
[00:24:30]  Brian, the last time she came out here, she showed us.  No, you stay there.  Hi.  Just stay there.  Here, put her over there.  Put her over there in that chair by that mic.  Rags to riches?  Pardon me?  Rags to riches?  Rags to...  Rags to bitches?  No.  I'm going to say that.  It's clean.  I don't understand it.  Eh, eh.  No, do you remember Rags to Riches, that club?  You were there.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  That's right.  How did I forget?  No, I thought you were talking about the movie Rags to Riches.  Oh, there was a movie?  I don't know.  Oh, my God. 
[00:25:00]  I think there was.  Yes, I did play in a club called Rags to Riches.  I never thought Brian would be more uncomfortable than the rat show.  You remember me from that.  That's very kind.  You're funny, man.  Well, that's really nice.  Funny and funny.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Now, what's your official title?  Tell Brian.  The comic stripper.  She is president-elect of the United States of America.  No.  I'm in Jugs this month, and it says comic stripper, so that's why.  Yeah, you're a comic stripper.  I'm the comic stripper.  Oh, great.  I tell Jugs naked.  In Jugs. 
[00:25:30]  If only we could be in Jugs, Opie, instead of Penthouse, to show that to our grandma.  And Laugh Biz Sucks.  Comic stripper Sandy Cain says Laugh Biz Sucks.  Something tells me that you and Brian have a very similar act.  You tell Jugs naked?  It depends on what night, you know?  Like on an off night, I might take, I might get naked.  I'd like to see that.  But I don't want to be stepping on your toes.  You know, they say that Irish guy, is it?  What? 
[00:26:00]  That's what they say, but it's not true.  Say what?  Because when I used to work in the peep shows, the most well-endowed man I ever met, I said,  what are you?  He says, I'm Irish.  I said, wow.  It's not true.  Well, then I would like to make it clear that I am Irish.  Oh, God.  There it is.  Yeah.  All right.  Do you have some examples of your act?  She brought her own microphone in.  Yeah, she's got a big black microphone.  Well, I had to bring her own microphone in.  Dildo wanted a dance.  He was rehearsing all week for this show. 
[00:26:30]  Can you effing believe this one?  Right, Dildo?  Okay.  So, Dildo is dancing?  Yeah.  Great.  A visual joke on the radio.  These go over very well.  Dildo is dancing school.  Very well.  Nothing funnier than a dancing dildo on radio.  We have to give play-by-play on what's happening.  And, you know, they don't have dancing schools for dildos.  Not yet.  It's spinning.  The dildo is spinning.  And it rounds the far turn, the half and 23 and 5, as they come down the stretch.  What the hell are you doing with the dildo?  They like you.  They like you.  You're talking to the dildo. 
[00:27:00]  That's good.  He's just, you know, he's very nervous.  Yeah.  Sure.  Who wouldn't be?  Now, give us an example of some of the jokes you tell in your act.  Okay.  You want to see two milkshakes?  Another visual bit.  She makes her boobs move.  And I'll take another classic radio call.  Oh, my God.  This is the worst catastrophe I've ever seen.  Get out of the way.  Oh, no.  The humanity.  Oh, my goodness.  All right.  Okay.  Dildo.  Like a joke.  Now she's adding it together. 
[00:27:30]  This is it.  This is it, folks.  You got dildo in my boobs.  You got boobs on my dildo.  Right.  All right.  This is me.  I'm a dancer.  Oh, look who's here.  All right.  It's Jay Moore has just walked in.  More Jay.  Hey, Jay.  All right.  Hey, everybody.  I wasn't going to interrupt Brian, but I figured there's a stripper here.  I wasn't going to come in and interrupt Brian out of respect.  And then I see a stripper with a dildo between her breasts.  And I think, well, I guess that cat's out of the bag.  Let's go break up the party.  He likes you, dildo.  She's stealing your hat, Jay.  Bend over, Jay. 
[00:28:00]  You were great on Bewitched.  You're the original lady, right?  That's the one they replaced.  Am I choking in?  Oh, my God.  You know, do we need this language on this program?  We try to adhere to certain standards.  I was called.  We try to, you know, adhere to certain standards and practices here on the Opie and Anthony's  playing.  Hello.  Gorgeous.  Brian's at Caroline's.  Caroline's.  That's great.  Tonight, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  Brian, you can talk to me on air. 
[00:28:30]  It's okay.  They know about us.  Can I come?  It's out.  All right.  Hold on.  Can I come?  Sure.  Of course.  We don't want Brian's horrified.  I'd like to have sex with both these guys.  All right.  Hold on.  We don't want Brian to run out in the studio.  I really would love to have sex with both these men.  That way.  They're gorgeous.  I'm sure it's mutual.  And you too, baby.  It's a nice offer.  Thank you.  Great.  I'm thrown in too.  I once had sex with five men, so.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, that's not a to write home about.  The guy with five penises, his pants fit like a glove. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, that one.  There you go.  Brian's going to start thinking we want him to never come back with the shows that we  have when he comes in.  I'm just trying to think of what bit I could possibly do right after that, you know?  Hey, Fig Newtons, you know, when you buy them.  Have you ever read the labels on a Fig Newtons box?  I don't get it.  Oh, my God.  Something tells me you don't get much. 
[00:29:30]  No, I don't.  I really don't.  Yeah.  Maybe it's a vibrator.  Yeah, why don't you turn that off?  Okay.  There's just something about an electronic humming sound that drives engineers crazy.  Like, who do you like?  I thought I was Radar from Mesh.  I was hearing an incoming missile.  I was like, how come no one else hears that?  It's going to be here any minute.  So there was a...  I'm talking like Brian.  Pearl Harbor Day.  It's coming over here.  Should we...  It is a big thing.  I love Dick.  He's sweeter than ice cream on his stick. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, my God.  That's my song.  Hello.  Hello.  Is this thing on?  It's still on.  It's still on.  All right, listen.  Turn the dildo on.  Hey, dildo.  They don't want...  All these garlic drawings on it and stuff.  All right, listen.  What are you, elementary kids?  Spray paint your dildo?  I'm a man I had.  I'm left.  Now we're going to...  No balls.  We're going to clean up the neighborhood, boys and girls.  We're going to spray paint a nice mural on this dildo.  No balls.  Welcome to 125th Street.  Please step lightly.  No balls. 
[00:30:30]  It's terrible.  All right.  Why don't we get Sandy King some water?  Brian Reed's playing...  Where are you playing, Brian?  I'm talking, man.  Caroline.  All right, hold on.  Where is it, Brian?  I'm heroin.  Caroline.  I'm Caroline.  Shoot me up with heroin.  All right, let's...  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Shoot me up with heroin?  All right, why don't we get Sandy King out of the studio for a little while?  Yeah, that was a nice introduction.  That was good.  That was a good introduction.  Robert Downey Jr.'s coming.  You know what I just figured out, lady?  If you leave, I have a place to plug in my headset.  I just figured that out. 
[00:31:00]  I was looking under the console, and yours is the one.  All right, listen.  Oh, God.  God, no.  She's just sitting on her scarf.  Making Sharon's phone naked like this.  What happened?  Brian Regan's at Caroline's, and I'm going to look at that.  What happened?  I'm not looking at it.  She just opened up her legs.  I do.  She's got a big store.  Because Jay was looking for a place to plug in his headset.  Oh, my God.  So anyway, these big Newton labels.  We're going to have you on in a little while to show everyone your hemorrhoid.  Okay, all right.  All right. 
[00:31:30]  I watch Sandy's TV show sometimes.  Yeah.  Oh, can I just plug that?  Yeah.  Plug it?  I know my show stinks, but.  No, come on.  Just give it a ramble.  Manhattan Neighborhood Network is listening, and I want to say hello to Eminem.  And my show is coming back on the air with brand new shows this coming Saturday night,  1230 on Channel 57 and RCN at 108.  So everyone watch.  Good plug.  No idea what she's saying.  Good plug.  Dildo will be on it, too. 
[00:32:00]  What's the frequency, Kenneth?  All right.  What's the frequency, Kenneth?  We have a few thousand people watching, right?  All right.  All right.  You know, we're going to get back to you in a couple of minutes.  Yeah.  So why don't you just wait out in the lobby or, I don't know, 57, or wherever you want  to wait, and make sure that the hemorrhoid is ready to pop out for later.  Oh.  My preparation H did for everyone.  Oh, God.  You can't take this.  All right.  Thank you, Sandy Kane.  Thank you.  We'll talk to you.  Thank you, Brian.  You'll be playing, Caroline.  I'm finally completely disgusted with our own program. 
[00:32:30]  Jay Moore.  All right.  All right.  Go.  All right.  There you go, Sandy.  There goes Sandy Kane.  Nice to meet you, Brian.  Okay.  There goes Sandy Kane.  Hey, comedian, I'm just curious.  Will you be at Caroline's this weekend?  I'm at Caroline's this weekend, yeah.  Brian is horrified.  Terrified.  Brian Regan at Caroline's.  Everything was cool.  If you're using that headset, you're crazy.  You'd probably get ear craps.  I think the French chef could cook what's in her pants.  Oh.  But she's doing her thing.  I try to be positive.  She's out there.  I try to see the good in all people. 
[00:33:00]  No, she's got an act.  You know, she's trying to...  Bring on the thalidomide kid that has sex with a pig.  Bring him on.  We'll get Brian.  I think your wife's horrified.  Yeah, I would be.  You're okay?  She's okay?  She's okay.  I'm horrified.  Yeah, but it's our show and I'm horrified.  I've got to apologize to, you know, Brian Regan's wife.  Half the show is an apology.  It's amazing.  We apologize to our guests.  We do an hour and then three hours of apologies.  It's like we don't know what's coming in. 
[00:33:30]  What is...  Oh, my God.  We're not going to be able to get to all the apologies.  We'll have to get...  Yeah, we'll get the rest of our...  We'll run them over into the next break.  We're like...  We'll see you guys in like two years.  No, you got married.  I saw Brian at the...  What were you?  Irvine Improv?  Irvine Improv, yeah.  And you guys were just getting married.  That's right.  And now I'm married.  Good for you, man.  When did you get married?  Two years ago.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Things are going well?  It's going great.  We didn't believe it up until he brought his wife in.  I got like 20 minutes of material out of it.  You just look at him and they kind of make themselves these wives gags. 
[00:34:00]  I'm sure that's very romantic for her to...  I got 20 more minutes now.  Thank you.  Thank you so much for being in my life.  20 minutes is a lot when you got to do an hour.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  Jay's got the...  The wives getting ready for a bed bit is really good.  So like when you're proposing, I was wondering if you could be included in my 20 minutes... 
[00:34:30]  No, we'll still like love each other and all that.  But I could get 20 minutes out of it.  What's her name?  Her name is Nicole.  Nicole.  That's great, man.  Well, good for you guys.  Good for you guys.  What are you talking about?  I don't want to sound like I'm bragging, but I got 25 minutes out of cash.  Oh, wow.  25 minutes of material.  She's got more layers than mine.  She's heavily layered.  She's deep. 
[00:35:00]  Multifaceted.  She's an old soul.  Yeah.  She shows a few more cards.  All right.  Let's take a break, all right?  Yes.  Brian Regan playing Caroline's all weekend long starting tonight through Sunday.  Call Caroline's for ticket info.  8 o'clock tonight.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-1-0.  There we go.  4-100.  Shut up!  This is Brian Regan's plug.  I'm helping.  I'm asking Brian Regan pertinent.  People need the phone number.  Bastard.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-100.  Opie Anthony. 
[00:35:30]  This is a God-given talent to be this stupid and this funny and this filthy.  1-2-7-5-7-4-1-0.  All right.  We're hanging with Brian Regan today, Anthony.  Yes.  He's horrified once again, so we did our job.  I don't know what it is.  I don't know how this happens.  Every time.  We're like that friend where they drink the sour milk and they're like,  Oh, this is awful.  Try it.  Yeah.  Taste this.  Next time I come in, I'm just going to have black tape over my eyes. 
[00:36:00]  You know, duct tape.  Yeah, you better.  I'm not going to see anything.  I really want to listen.  Brian Regan playing Caroline's all weekend long starting tonight.  Call Caroline's for tickets.  I'm telling you, you'll laugh your yambag off.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-1-100.  A lot of people want to say hi.  Brian, what's going on?  Yo, what's up?  Hey, man.  Yo, I got to thank you for getting that hemorrhoid woman out of there, first of all.  Yeah, we figured we'd mix it up a little bit, but that went horribly wrong, huh? 
[00:36:30]  Mix it up.  You don't want to, you know, blow her out all in one second.  Oh, hey, I could say blow out, but you can't say that.  I mean, blow.  Yeah, all right.  We know.  Anyway, listen, listen.  You're not really going to have her back on, are you?  Maybe to show off the hemorrhoid, you know, after Brian leaves.  Yeah.  I'll stick around.  So you're going to put Jay Moore through the torment.  I'll stick around.  I think we're corrupting this guy, man.  Brian Regan, he works clean, okay?  Absolutely clean.  You could take a child to his act, and it's hysterical. 
[00:37:00]  I do believe this guy has a sick side, though.  A couple more of these shows, he's going to get on stage.  Hickory dickory dog.  It's Jiggy.  I'm Brian Regan.  I'm the legend.  Oh.  What happened to all the childhood stuff?  It's like, you know, the rat thing last time.  It's like, you guys were, like, really cool.  Like, well, we know you got to go, and there's something about me that just couldn't leave.  I got to watch this, man.  These guys are going to be eating these damn rats. 
[00:37:30]  I got to see it.  And now there's a hemorrhoid.  A hemorrhoid waiting to pop out.  You ever read the panel on Fig Newton?  Let me tell you something.  I had this Fig Newton in this chick.  Oh.  Andrew Dice Regan.  The big yellow one's the sun, you deaf and see.  Oh.  A cup of dirt.  A cup of dirt.  I call it cup of dirt, you stupid whore. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, yeah.  More good or less.  Brooks, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, ONA?  How's it going?  All right.  I'm a big Brian Regan fan.  I just want to let you guys know that I had pizza for lunch today.  Listen, I just wanted to congratulate Brian on being funny as anything and still keeping his act clean.  Yeah.  Thanks, bro.  I mean, that's just, I've seen him, I'm originally from North Carolina and I saw him down there in Charlotte and we're going Friday night. 
[00:38:30]  I'm really looking forward to it.  Yeah, it's a great show.  Cool, man.  It's a great show.  I'm not going to be in Charlotte Friday night.  But I appreciate the judge.  We're looking forward to it.  Thank you so much, man.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  Right on, man.  I just had pizza.  That was funny.  Can I request a bit?  Because I'm like, look at you.  I'm a big fan, though.  You know.  You still got the slow cone. 
[00:39:00]  Lousy.  Little egg.  I like Donut Lady.  Donut Lady.  Yeah.  I like Donut Lady.  You know.  I'll just get right into it.  Yeah.  It's interesting you mention that.  Because I bought some donuts today.  Which is a weird coincidence.  You know, those ladies that work in the donut places, I just, I feel so bad for them because people can't make up their mind. 
[00:39:30]  You know, people go in there and they freak out.  But they just, they walk in.  Oh.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  I want a dozen donuts.  And you got a lot of donuts.  Okay.  All right.  I'm going to start with four chocolate.  I want two twisty goose.  I want a lemon twirler.  I want honey twirl.  I want a raspberry puffy twirl.  No.  Two chocolate.  No. 
[00:40:00]  One.  Put them back.  Put them back.  I want a Bavarian apple crunch.  Get the ladder.  Hey.  Hey.  Why don't you go out inside and think it over, huh?  It's a big decision.  You can't blow donut day.  But the donut ladies, they know how to get back.  They know how to get back at you.  They do the subtraction for you in front of all the other customers and make you look stupid.  You go in there.  Um.  Yeah.  I'd like a dozen donuts.  I'll start with, uh.  I'll start with seven chocolate.  You have five left. 
[00:40:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Okay.  All right.  If I order one more, then how many would I have left?  How many would I have then, donut lady?  That's what I need to know and now.  I don't know how she does it, man.  I think she's palming a clicker.  She's cupping some kind of advantage.  God damn.  That's great stuff.  I hate you to do that. 
[00:41:00]  What are you talking about?  He's talking about donuts and he doesn't mention, like, whores.  I didn't think of that, man.  Andrew Dice Regan, okay?  Another direction I could take that.  Sure.  What are you waiting for?  Come to the dark side, okay?  Now, let's say donut lady starts playing ring toss on your meat.  Now, that's funny. 
[00:41:30]  If you go to the show tonight, I'll be throwing that in.  What?  I don't believe he's doing it.  Hey!  Sarah checking in.  Coincidence, he's eating donuts right now.  More people telling us what he's eating.  That was so funny.  I'm having dinner right now.  Okay, my question.  Pizza.  It doesn't have to do with anything.  Yeah, let's go to George.  George, what's up?  Hey, George.  I'm listening on the radio to a 27-second delay. 
[00:42:00]  I haven't heard them ask for me yet.  The radio, but they're talking to me on the phone.  George is gathering his thoughts.  Which should I acknowledge, phone or radio?  Right now, he's writing them down in a placard.  Well, I write it, then I read it.  I hold it over my head on Oak Tag.  Wait, I'm driving.  My current thought.  Jim, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, yeah, I had a funny conversation at the airport the other day.  I was checking in my bags for the flight, and the woman said, have a good flight. 
[00:42:30]  And I said, you too.  I felt like a freaking tool.  That's one of my favorite Brian Ringo.  You feel so bad for saying that.  When I listened to your bit you were doing on it, I was like, God damn.  You just, you can never get over that embarrassment.  You just have to run away.  Run away.  That happened to me about four months ago at the airport.  I swear.  You did it.  And the reservations gave me the tickets, and she said, enjoy your flight.  I said, you too.  And I said, I don't believe I just did that.  And she goes, oh, it happens all the time.  I'm like, listen, you have no idea. 
[00:43:00]  No, you don't know how bad this is.  You have no idea how dumb of an error this is coming from me.  She had no idea what I was talking about.  So I just slinked away.  You too, in case you fly later.  If you get on a plane sometime, then you enjoy your flight then.  That's all I'm saying.  That's all I'm trying to say.  If you think about it.  If you have a chance to have a flight.  If you get a chance.  It's not easy to get a chance to have a flight. 
[00:43:30]  If you get a chance to have a flight, then I would take it.  Get on in and enjoy it.  You too.  Holy Jesus.  In case you fly.  You too.  Brian, can I request one other thing?  You don't have to do the whole thing.  Sure.  Do the donut lady again.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I love that one.  You're obviously.  Just keep doing it.  You're obviously in New York for the weekend. 
[00:44:00]  Yes.  With your lovely wife.  Yes.  Playing Carolines, huh?  Good, right?  That's right.  All weekend long.  Call Carolines.  212-757-4100.  Are you staying at a hotel or at a friend's house?  Wow.  Nice, Sophie.  This must be on your mind.  Too subtle.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I just love that one part of the bed.  Actually, you don't have to do the whole thing.  I'm staying at a friend's house.  Yeah?  Yeah.  They're letting me sleep on their fold-out couch. 
[00:44:30]  Which is nice, you know?  It's nice when people put you up.  But people don't sleep on their own fold-out couch.  They have no idea what a torture rack the thing is, you know?  They mean well.  It's like, oh, here, you can sleep on it.  Yeah!  Yeah!  They're opening up this big thing.  It's all cockeyed.  There's one leg that won't even hit the ground.  They're brushing off old Pop-Tart crumbs.  They're flapping sheets all over hell.  We're going to get it all set up.  We're going to get it all set up.  You feel goofy just standing there with your hands on your hips. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah!  Set it up.  Set it up for me.  Let me know when it's all set.  All set up.  And then they have a mattress.  You know, it's about like a quarter inch thick.  And they have that death bar going right down the middle.  You know, it's like you're sleeping at the top of a dog house.  Oh, this is nice.  The next morning, did you sleep well?  Yeah, once I got onto the couch with the dog. 
[00:45:30]  So, no, I'm not in a hotel.  I'm not staying in a hotel.  Because they insisted that you stay with them, yes.  Oh, man.  I don't know.  Hey, Jay.  Jay's back.  Jay's back in business.  Brian, isn't there a donut shop right by the people's house?  Yes, there is, Jay.  I went in there.  No, there is.  Seriously.  I don't think Jay heard the last.  Where were you, Jay? 
[00:46:00]  People listening.  Does he just have the two jokes?  Tony, what's going on?  Tony.  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey, we're hanging with Brian Riggins.  Yeah, I was just thinking about Brian the other day because I went to a McDonald's drive-thru  and I ordered those super-sized meals that they give you.  Yeah.  They gave me those huge sodas and I couldn't fit into my cup holder.  And I'm going out to everybody in my cup like, I should have gone to medium.  I should have gone to medium.  Nobody got what I was saying.  I think medium is the most ludicrous size anyway. 
[00:46:30]  What does that mean, you know?  And what I do, you know what you do when you go into these places?  You order an extra medium.  And that just throws them for a loop, you know?  The guy just turns around.  He's like, oh.  See him talking with the manager.  I don't know.  He said he wanted extra medium.  And I'm looking at the mediums.  I don't know how to extra it.  You go into these fast food places, they got the cup-sized display hanging from a string. 
[00:47:00]  You know, some kid had to tie it up in the air conditioning duct, you know?  There they are.  There are the cup sizes.  Check them over carefully because it's time to pick a cup.  And next to the big one, there's a big arrow and it says, best value.  What kind of thing is that to do?  Why do you have the other two?  What is that to do?  Why are you doing that to your customers?  You want the best?  That's the best.  This is the nitwit size.  This is our fool's cup. 
[00:47:30]  What are people like looking at?  I don't know what to...  I don't know which one to...  They got so many...  Wait a second.  That one has an arrow.  That one has a big arrow.  And it says, best.  Yeah, they wouldn't lie, man.  They wouldn't lie to you.  It's unlimited refills on all sizes.  It's all you want for 89 cents, all you want for $1.09, or all you want for $1.49. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, you go for that best value.  You keep digging for more coins.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, boy.  Caroline's.  Tonight, tomorrow, Saturday, Sunday.  Yeah.  He kills every time he's in town.  Are you guys going to go?  Yeah, we'll be there tomorrow night.  Tomorrow night?  Know what Brian did for us?  I got to thank you.  We went and saw him at another comedy club last time he was in town. 
[00:48:30]  I bought him a free drink, Jay.  It's mighty whiny.  Appreciate it.  He found out that we were staying for the second show.  Yeah.  He changed his entire act just to suit us.  Even though it was a whole new audience.  Yeah.  You know, it wasn't there for the first act.  I did Jay's act.  I was tapped on my own stuff.  Yours has been working for me at colleges for years.  That old get out of a hole.  That Regan shovel.  They're not buying my stuff.  Oh, ever go to the donut shop? 
[00:49:00]  Let's go to Beth.  Beth, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  I wanted to let Brian know that he doesn't know how many times he's referred to in our  family.  All during the Subway Series, my brothers and I are like, great, two way, two way, two  way.  And then you do it out of the club and you wait for like a sports bar and you wait for  one guy in the back to go, what the hell does that mean?  And you're like, dude, Brian Regan fan.  You know, when I used to play on right field, you know, I never knew what was going on out  there.  And a second baseman would like do the Texas Longhorn thing with his hands and do, Brian, 
[00:49:30]  two way, two way, Brian.  You know, like I'm some kind of moron.  Oh, okay.  Two way, Brian.  Thank you for the information.  The special attention.  Apparently, I didn't know where to stand in right field either.  I don't know what it is with the infielders.  You know, they think they think they know what's going on.  The second baseman would turn around and always tell me to stand somewhere other than where 
[00:50:00]  I already was.  Brian, back up.  Brian, a little bit to the right.  You know, like I'm a little, I actually just have strings, you know, Mr. Puppet.  You direct me, Mr. Second Baseman.  I don't know anything.  I'm an outfielder.  Direct me to an appropriate position that you would know about being an infielder and  all.  God damn, you're killing me. 
[00:50:30]  God damn.  Yes.  Manny, what's going on?  Brian is freaking funny.  Can you tell him?  Please, a request.  Can you have him do that dumb student skit?  You know what?  Please.  You can go to Caroline's.  I'll save Brian 15 minutes.  You'll be doing that at Caroline's.  Yeah, I'd throw that in here.  It's kind of a lengthy thing, man, but I appreciate it, you know? 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  He'll do it at Caroline's, Manny.  All right, thanks.  Thanks a lot, man.  We actually played it on the air yesterday for everybody, and Brian will do it live at Caroline's.  It's stupid in school.  It's hilarious.  Manny, bring a friend.  That's a good Christmas present.  Take somebody to a Brian Regan show.  There you go.  Wow, look at that.  Good Christmas present.  Hey, look at that, man.  Scratching my back.  And I think you should go see the next Jay Moore motion picture.  Somebody had to say it.  These plugs are, like, on different levels.  You can go see Brian at Tee Hee's, or else you can go see a Christmas blockbuster motion 
[00:51:30]  picture with Jay Moore.  And we're on the other side, Brian.  And don't forget to pick up Penthouse.  Yeah.  Don't be an Anthony at a Penthouse.  And, of course, Jugs magazine has Sandy Kane in it.  And her hemorrhoid.  Eh, eh, eh.  Quack, quack.  Oh, golly.  It's just a melting pot.  Brian's one of the only comics that I ever drove to go see.  He was at Irvine.  And that's, like, an hour out of L.A. 
[00:52:00]  And I made my wife get in the car.  And we drove all the way down to Irvine to see him.  In rush hour traffic.  I'm very flattered.  Really?  Not Dinacola?  Not a...  No way.  No, Brian, I would drive to see, like, Chris Rock.  Trying to think, like, Otto and George, I go out of my way to see him.  I would see a Jay Moore movie, but not if I had to drive.  No, I like him, but if it was, like, right across this tree, I go, yeah, I'll walk over here.  Well, fortunately, you can see him when you fly.  Yeah.  No, that's pretty much a theme. 
[00:52:30]  Jay Moore.  It's a good rental, right?  Jay Moore.  And it's Jay Moore's.  Jay Moore's.  Yeah, they had the ass.  Jay Moore's in that?  I like Jay Moore's.  Jay Moore's.  Hey, let's go to Matt.  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  What's up, Jay and Brian?  Hey, what's up, man?  Yo, I had a question for Brian.  Yeah.  I was down south in Georgia last summer, and I saw a movie, and in the trailer, you know,  when they, like, when they show you, oh, you do?  No, no, no.  I'm thinking of something else.  I don't know where anything is going. 
[00:53:00]  You know, in the beginning of the movie, they have the stupid candy dancing, like, let's  go to the lobby?  Right, right.  Well, I saw one with Brian, who was like, hey, let's go get some popcorn.  That's right.  And then you see him at the sink.  I only saw it, like, three times, though.  It was the funniest stuff.  Brian and me.  You were on a, you were in the, like, movie thing?  Brian didn't seem too happy about this.  No, no, no.  Remember that porn film in the 70s, Brian?  You got the big 70s mustache, pork chop sideburns, and you're with two other guys? 
[00:53:30]  I know where this is going.  Did the rabbit live, Brian?  How's the rabbit?  I remember it looked like it got stepped on.  No, it was Coca-Cola did these, like, little trailers, you know, that's like a minute  long before the, before the movie started.  And it was me just ordering a Coke and a popcorn and then doing one of my bits, you know.  But what was interesting is, you know, I would like, the very first take, you know, I said,  yeah, I'd like to have a Coke and a popcorn.  And they go, cut, cut.  Large popcorn. 
[00:54:00]  And large Coke.  Large Coke.  I'm like, okay, I see what this is all about.  This is all about Coke.  Must buy large Coke.  Not, not about my little comedy sketch.  Say large, delicious, wonderful Coca-Cola.  Then that little comedy thing.  Succulent.  But it was fun, man.  It was fun to do.  I'm glad that guy saw it.  All right, let's go to Vito.  The phone calls are going wild now.  Vito, what's up? 
[00:54:30]  Hey, what's up, Brian?  You are one funny mother effort.  Thank you, Vito.  Hey, listen, I got to ask you a question.  I'm having a little problem cooking Pop-Tarts in a microwave.  You got any suggestions?  Even your listeners are good set up, guys.  Very sharp.  Yeah, man.  You know, I don't understand.  You know, when you do look at the Pop-Tart box, you know, they got the directions.  I mean, can there be a simpler food item than Pop-Tarts?  Like if the directions weren't on there, would somebody just set the box in front of them  and just look at it like, oh, how do I get that goodness in me? 
[00:55:00]  Where do you go?  How do you start?  But you don't have to fret because they got directions.  They have two sets.  They have toaster directions, which is more than one step.  It just kills me that toaster directions are longer than one step.  You'd think it would be step one, toast the Pop-Tarts.  Go ahead.  Toast them.  Hey, are you still reading this? 
[00:55:30]  But they've managed to break it up into smaller increments.  These are like the actual steps.  Number one, I swear, it says remove pastry from pouch.  Oh, okay.  Let me get them out of the pouch.  All right.  I see where they're going with this.  I think we're banging on all cylinders now.  Okay, number two, insert pastry.  Okay, we got the pastry all organized.  Insert pastry vertically. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, oh, no.  That's when your brain explodes in the whole vertical concept.  I mean, at one point, they just start assuming you would understand certain things, you know.  And then the microwave directions.  I had no idea you could microwave a Pop-Tart.  How long does it take to toast a Pop-Tart, you know?  A minute and a half if you want it dark.  People don't have that kind of time.  You know, if you need to zap fry your Pop-Tarts before you head out the door, you might want to loosen up your schedule. 
[00:56:30]  And I swear, it says microwave on high for three seconds.  I don't think I want to wake up and be eaten in three seconds, you know?  The alarm goes off.  Put it in.  Ding, ding.  Oh, it's lit.  I've got to get out of here.  If you're waking, eating, and hauling in three seconds, it's time for a change of lifestyle.  Pick up some Montana brochures or something.  I don't know if that answers your question. 
[00:57:00]  What a coincidence that that guy was asking a Pop-Tart question.  Yeah, because I happen to know about Pop-Tarts.  Yeah, I had the advice right there.  Wow.  Kenneth, what's going on?  Kenneth.  Yeah, man.  I just want to let him know, man.  He's funny.  He's hysterical, man.  Yeah.  We tell you guys every time he comes to town, man.  Thank you, Kenneth.  Hey, no problem, brother.  All right, tickets going fast.  Caroline's Brian Regan.  Tonight through Sunday, 2-1-2-7-5-7-4-100 for ticket info.  I think we're all going tomorrow night. 
[00:57:30]  Make sure you make reservations.  Comics like that.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Then we know you're coming.  Yeah, call ahead.  We get all juiced up beforehand.  Call ahead.  Make sure you make a reservation.  It goes down in the ledger that you will be at the party.  All the inside info we're getting here from the comics.  Jay knows all about that kind of thing, man.  You got to call in and get reservations.  You got to call it.  If you don't, they don't give us our dope backstage.  Who did I let that slip? 
[00:58:00]  They got us trained.  Hey, Bob, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Brian, you're great.  Thank you, man.  Listen, my kind of humor doesn't go over good in my house with three daughters.  Uh-oh.  My wife's like, keep your mouth shut around these kids.  But you'd slide in right between Bing Crosby Christmas and all my Christmas CDs.  I got to get that Boxing CD.  Yeah, man.  What's the name of that CD?  Uh, I came up with a really fancy title.  Brian Regan Live. 
[00:58:30]  Okay.  That's good.  I like that.  That whole volcano scene.  It's totally my wife, man.  I told my wife, Mike, hey, keep the kids home from school.  Why don't you go bring the project to school?  You built it.  Thanks a lot, man.  Thanks, man.  Bye-bye.  And you can get it on Amazon.com.  Inspiring people.  I wasn't sure.  Brian Regan.  I wasn't sure if that guy was complimenting you in the beginning when he said you were  like Bing Crosby and your Christmas CD rack. 
[00:59:00]  Is he really slamming me?  Yeah, what is that?  Yeah, rock and roll to you, buddy.  I feel you.  Let's go to Derek.  You're like Charo.  Back at you.  You too.  When people come up and they like, you know, they say they like you and somebody else  and then the other person is like so off the charts.  You don't know how to take it.  You and Bozo the Clown.  You've got to be the funniest two guys on the planet.  When he honks his nose and when you do your routines, hey, thank you, man. 
[00:59:30]  When I watch you, you know what I see?  Frank Stallone and the parrot from Beretta.  You light me up, man.  Doesn't that just negate the compliment?  It just negates the compliment completely.  It's like you rule, man.  And then they tell you about stuff you've done and it's like some of the stuff that  you're proud of.  And then they just turn around and say something like, yeah, Bozo.  I really like that.  There's some real hat.  Like, oh, Christ.  Just throw everything out the window.  Couldn't you have dropped dead of a stroke before you got to that part of the compliment? 
[01:00:00]  I like you.  I like the kind of stuff you do.  And I like when somebody sticks a pie in somebody's face.  I just laugh.  You know, there's a pie.  You don't know.  Hey, it's in his face.  And your stuff, too.  The stuff you do in the pie.  Dude, I think you're talented, man.  You make me laugh.  Hey, do you know Sinbad?  You ever run into him?  Oh, God.  You run into him?  Because you two guys are the best.  Wow.  And Laverne and Shirley just cracks me up.  You know when they go, who could be that stupid? 
[01:00:30]  And they walk through the door.  That gag.  I got to throw in.  I like Sinbad.  I thought so.  I saw a little tension there.  I like Sinbad as well.  I like that show.  Look at Jay now.  I like Sinbad.  No, I will go on the record saying I do think Sinbad is funny.  Do you?  All right.  Derek, I've never seen him.  I do think he's very funny.  Derek, what's up?  Hey, ONA.  Hey.  Hey, how's it going?  Jay?  Brian?  Yes, sir.  Hey, Brian, I saw you up in Boston a while ago, and I'm not really sure about the bit, 
[01:01:00]  but I know it involved the station wagon and your little brother.  Do you remember what I'm talking about?  Yeah, the closer when he has for something else.  My big five-minute thank you and good night thing?  Ah, you're great.  You think I'm going to do that here?  You think I'm going to go to Caroline?  The thing that makes him stand up thing.  Thanks, guys. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  I appreciate it.  Could you do that high on Brian Regan thing?  Do that thing where there's no reason for anybody to come out and do it.  We're two bits away from having people not show up if they just heard everything.  Yeah, I think we taped it all.  It's on Napster right now.  It's downloaded for nothing.  That's what's good about Brian Regan.  Brian Regan's got...  These guys have forgotten more material than I've ever written.  There you go.  He's got hundreds of stuff.  Brian Regan at Caroline's.  Are you drunk? 
[01:02:00]  We do have some champagne here.  I've been laughing for the last hour.  He's got hundreds of stuff.  Hundreds of stuff.  And each one more gooder than the last.  Hey, you guys behave.  I'm bringing Sandy Cain back in here.  I'm glad you got that, Brian.  It's out on a marquee.  Brian Regan, hundreds of stuff.  That's the next CD title.  That's actually a great title.  Hundreds of stuff.  Hundreds of stuff.  That would be a great name.  It would be funny.  Because there's hundreds of stuff in it.  All right, all right.  I'm going to bring Sandy Cain back in with the hemorrhoids.  There's hundreds of stuff in the CD. 
[01:02:30]  CJ's loving it.  Bring Sandy back in.  Oh, no.  You're punishing everybody.  Don't punish Brian Regan, because I had that.  Brian, do you really want to check out the hemorrhoid?  He doesn't want to say yes, but he'll stick around.  You know, it depends on how graphic.  And how close it gets to you.  How hemorrhoidal the hemorrhoid is.  I don't know if I literally want to see a hemorrhoid.  I've never seen a hemorrhoid.  How's your hemorrhoid, donut lady? 
[01:03:00]  Plus, it would be unfair for me to, you know, I mean, that would be her time.  You know what I mean?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Is that one of the hundreds of stuff that you have that is extremely funny?  I'm trying to be diplomatic.  Diplomatic?  What are you dealing with?  Nice enough to let me do my thing.  I'll let her do her thing.  Truly the nicest guy in comedy.  Yeah.  I don't want to step on her toes.  You know, she's got things to promote.  Chugs magazine.  Hey, you never know who's going to pop one day. 
[01:03:30]  Maybe that hemorrhoid.  It's a last opportunity to see it.  It's like popcorn.  Some pop, some don't.  You never know.  That television show on Venus that she was promoting.  You may need a favor from her one day.  Oh, God.  If it ever gets to that point, shoot me.  If you want to talk to Johnny, you got to go through Sandy.  All right.  I was hoping we'd all see the hemorrhoid in Bond, but I guess not.  You know, I'd like to hear, like, the preliminary conversations about it.  And then, right.  There you go.  All right.  Bring Sandy back in here.  Bring Sandy up.  Hundreds of stuff. 
[01:04:00]  Hundreds of stuff.  All right.  All right.  We're down to 98.  Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.  Yeah, so Brian Regan at Caroline's.  Tonight through Sunday.  You will not be disappointed at the hundreds of stuff.  Okay, you can break.  So, here comes Sandy.  When I come into town, I'm always like, who's at Caroline's?  And if somebody's good, I get all excited that I'm in New York.  Who's that, Rick?  Thank you, Jay.  Phil, this is the guy that called up earlier and wants to rub the lotion?  That's who I look.  Oh, my God.  Really? 
[01:04:30]  This guy wants to put...  He's got a tie on and everything.  This guy wants to put preparation A's on.  You look like a normal guy.  Yeah, well, so did Ted Bundy.  So did Ted Bundy.  Tell me about it.  All right, I'm leaving.  I like it.  I want to tell you.  So did Ted Bundy.  I love that show, Matt.  All right.  She's talking to her dildo again, Anthony.  All right.  No, this is my husband.  I'm Sandy.  Oh, my God.  I'm not lucky enough to have a girlfriend like you.  Didn't we quickly forget how annoying it is to have her in here until she gets back in?  You're like, well, it really was really. 
[01:05:00]  Can I say rear?  Can you say...  Whatever.  Can I say vagina?  They'll deal with it down the hallway.  Anybody can say rear.  Right.  You can say rear.  Can you say the A word?  Just don't say anything.  A-H?  How about we start there?  Yeah, the word rear is pretty much accepted everywhere you go.  It just matters the context.  There's not too many places you can't get away with rear.  Come on, cable.  I'm public access.  You can say anything.  Maybe a few board meetings.  I'm doing it with a donkey next week.  I can't even think of a board meeting where they wouldn't appreciate the word rear. 
[01:05:30]  You can do it with a donkey.  You can tolerate it.  She's just going and going.  She doesn't stop.  Of course.  There's four people talking at the same time.  All right.  This is always good.  Sandy.  I know I'm a pig.  I know it.  I wish somebody put this retard out of his misery.  I haven't been this annoyed since that bitch from Big Brother was here.  Oh, God damn.  Brittany.  Hey, you didn't let me show my breasts here?  Well, there's a reason for that.  I mean, it's a biding and delightful. 
[01:06:00]  Don't hide on the bottom.  Why don't you show up?  Jay Moore is here.  They love him.  I'm only here because Brian Regan is here.  Last night I was watching action with Jay and I was taking my breasts.  It's Brian Regan time, honey.  I mean...  No, that's right.  Oh, Brian Regan.  No, no, no.  He's reading me, Regan.  Yes.  I'm Brian Ronald Reagan.  Gorgeous.  Let me say this.  Mr. Gorbachev, cover up those boobs.  I want to meet up Brian to impress Jodie Foster.  I thought her boobs were Gorby's head until I saw him. 
[01:06:30]  It had no stain.  If you're Reagan, I've got to do something to Brian to...  All right, Sandy.  Sandy.  All right.  What do you want to do?  You've got a few minutes here.  What is this?  What is she doing?  She's holding up pictures of other women in the magazine.  That isn't you.  I'm not opposed to that photo.  That isn't you.  Jay's not opposed to that photo.  I don't mind that photo.  That is accepted.  What's the problem with that?  Yeah.  What's the problem with that?  Sandy.  Well, I'm in Juggs this month, so...  Yeah, Sandy.  What do you want to show us?  What do you want to show us?  What do you want to do?  They're real Juggs.  All right, let's see your...  How can you tell when they hang down to your waist? 
[01:07:00]  They're real.  All right.  Let's...  Would you like to see them?  Brian, there's still time to get out of here.  I'm going to review my notes.  Brian, if you...  Go over your act.  Me and my middle finger were going crazy for you last night.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Sorry.  All right.  Well, what...  You got...  Oh, my God.  I think I just swallowed my chew.  Which one do I like?  It'll make you less nauseous, Jay.  Like Ron Guidry in the line drive comes back at him.  This girl was showing the food.  Like in the Bronx Zoo.  You ever eat the Bronx Zoo? 
[01:07:30]  Me and my middle finger.  No, Jay.  It's incredible.  No, Jay.  What happens, Sam?  You liar.  Jay's just talking about...  I'm trying to keep everybody's mind away from my hemorrhoid.  It's like a three-ring circus.  I know.  Three different things.  Only all in the same ring.  I'm just talking over Sandy.  What is she doing?  I'm going to feel like she's undressing because I feel so comfortable.  Oh, my God.  Oh, here she goes.  No, seriously.  She's undressing.  Now you'll see the ravage of a law called gravity.  I asked Sandy how old she was.  She wouldn't tell me.  I said, can you keep a secret? 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's mine.  Really?  I want you to tell me exactly where you were when you found out that Lincoln was cut.  You cut her in half and count the rings.  Sandy, you can tell the age.  I can't believe you talked over that line.  I know.  I'm over 30.  It's not like you're 30 and you look 25, you know?  That was a good joke.  Hey, I mean, I'm old, okay?  No, I mean, you don't have to keep it secret.  Over 30, though.  I mean, I'm over 30.  Wow.  I never would have guessed that.  I'm over 30, baby.  So, over 30 years old.  How long do we have to wait?  Because you really don't have the body where you can, like, do the tantalizing angle. 
[01:08:30]  You know, make us wait.  That's a tantalizing angle.  You know, we're, like, going on.  I hope you take some time.  What?  You don't think I have a great body?  Yeah, actually, for a woman your age, that I, as old, you're the age I think you are.  I'd like to see you naked, Jay.  I'm sure there's something you could download.  Are you going to show the hemorrhoid?  Oh, okay.  Because this guy here wants to rub preparation age on your hemorrhoid. 
[01:09:00]  You're old school.  She's wanting to paste these.  Okay, let me just take my top off, okay?  She's old school.  She's really old school.  Well, you go right to the hemorrhoid, you guys.  Oh, man.  Yeah, aren't we?  The guy can't really work that tantalizing angle when you've got a body like that.  It's nothing sacred anymore.  Oh, I'm going to get sick.  You have the rub of love.  You should have a really fast striptease song.  See, I should take it.  Hey, guys, I don't believe it, but.  Look at the time.  I'm looking at the clock.  I've got to get out of here, man.  The cab driver tipped me.  You guys are going to tip me for this?  A lot.  Your stripping song should be like the countdown to New Year's. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah, because it's only like 10 seconds long.  Oh, sorry.  You have to get that done.  Yeah, you can't refer to a.  She asks about rear.  Yeah.  You can't refer to breasts as the T word.  Oh, my God.  What has she got?  Holy Jesus.  I thought I never.  I thought I would never say this to a woman.  Put your clothes back on.  A nude woman, turn around and say, could you put your clothes back on?  What are you doing?  I just want to light my breasts on fire because I have a lot of fans listening. 
[01:10:00]  They all said, Sandy, you're going to lighten your breasts up.  And I said, yes, I'll be on Opie and Anthony Life.  I smell rum and poontang.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  So, I mean, this is for my fans.  No one in this room wants to see.  Are those blasting caps?  Excuse me?  Are those blasting caps?  Hundreds of stuff.  Oh, my God.  What is she doing?  I burned them off.  What's going on there?  There's a hole in your nipple. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, my God.  Are you lactating?  I can't take this.  I can't take this.  You just put a match in the hole in her nipple.  Where there is supposed to be the nip, there is a hole.  Oh, I'm probably getting the chill looking at it.  Are you getting the heebie-jeebies?  No, I burnt them.  I burnt them off one night.  So, they go in now?  And so, they never grew back.  Show World.  You work in the A-rooms.  Oh, did you get compensation?  Did you get compensation?  Did you get compensation from Show World?  Are you out on comp?  So, they got a good plan over there.  What is that?  The Hartford goes through a...  Woody Giuliani came. 
[01:11:00]  He says, hey.  Yeah.  You deserve some compensation.  Wow, that's nice.  That's wonderful.  She's lighting her boobs on fire.  That's good.  They're both lit up.  They're hot.  Wow.  Okay.  I'm wishing for an oxygen atmosphere in here right now, or hydrogen, something.  Yeah, Apollo 1.  I'm going to kill Apollo 1, or the Hindenburg, anything.  You look like two miles of bad roads.  I'm available for New Year's Eve.  Oh, yeah?  That would be a party.  And birthday parties. 
[01:11:30]  What is that?  A proposition?  Okay.  What are you doing for New Year's?  Sandy Kaye's coming over.  Well, Jay wants to see her hemorrhoid.  She rented the whole year.  Jay wants to see her hemorrhoid.  Jay, do you want to see her hemorrhoid?  Opie, you missed my hemorrhoid.  I don't know what a hemorrhoid looks like, so I don't even know what you're showing me  is a hemorrhoid.  I mean, you really made me do that, baby.  All right, show Jay.  It's one of those things you'll just know.  You didn't show me.  Show Jay.  No.  I don't want to see it.  Show Jay.  Show this guy.  No, because Brian will get collateral damage if she shows Jay.  He'll take shrapnel.  Right. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  Oh, God, why didn't I leave?  Mom.  Why didn't I leave?  Eh.  Okay, you want to see her?  Eh, eh, eh.  No, I don't.  Do you like it in the rear?  No, I do not.  Do you ever do that to a woman in the rear?  Okay.  Well, this is...  I did not answer that question.  Why don't we bring her back in?  This is so just disgusting now.  I know, I know.  All right, just show Jay your hemorrhoid so we can move on.  No.  That's cute.  Okay.  Why is she doing this?  Okay.  Why is she on?  This guy. 
[01:12:30]  All right, this guy over here.  I made him in the elevator.  Yeah.  Get the girl from Big Brother back.  Swing the mic over to this gentleman over here.  Yeah.  Brian Regan's at Caroline's this weekend?  Yes.  Yeah, we're listening to...  What are the show times?  No, we're listening to the comedic stylings of Brian Regan right now.  Oh, God, no.  He's got a book and he's got an ass.  All right, she's still talking.  Now, sir.  Yes.  Well, what's your name or the name you want to give?  Phil.  And you brought some Preparation H.  I did.  You have a glove on?  I do.  Yeah.  He's putting on a biohazard suit. 
[01:13:00]  It looks like Outbreak.  It looks like the Michelin Man.  I'm guessing that hemorrhoid is older than I am.  Now, it probably is.  You have Preparation H, the glove, and you're going to apply this to her hemorrhoid.  Sure.  I'm getting the heebie-jeebies right here.  This definitely seemed like a better idea about three hours ago.  My hemorrhoid loves you.  Very good-looking guy.  He's not going to wink at me, is he?  What did you think it was going to be?  He said, oh, this is worse than I expected.  What did you expect?  Hey, Brian. 
[01:13:30]  Hi.  Brian.  You know, I look like Britney Spears, and I really want you to apply this.  I really don't have hemorrhoids, and I'm going to turn around.  You're going to apply it that way with your own special applicator.  Here we go.  Are you ready, guys?  Yeah, let's go.  But he gets this.  I'm just going to.  Brian, like the first.  Yeah, Brian, you just sit tight.  Brian, the first five times I was here, Brian, it was like young strippers.  And now look at what we got.  Cousins are making out.  That's all right.  You go do your thing.  Girls are getting their hoods pierced.  I'm going to come see you tonight. 
[01:14:00]  All right.  All right.  Quit your talking.  But wait, wait, wait.  Before you do this, a J or someone is going to have to mic her.  Don't look at me.  You've got to swing the mic around and then use it again.  Now, don't do anything yet.  Put the mic in front of her face.  This is life, Jay.  This is life, baby.  All right.  Now, give us a little three, two, one countdown, and then just let it rip.  And don't be shy.  Really get in there.  She was in here.  You're not going to fart again, are you?  Oh, I'd love it if she farted.  Oh, good.  I would like to. 
[01:14:30]  I would like to.  Let me see.  You're farted by the mic.  This is horrific.  So, Brian, do you like watching fishing on TV?  Speaking of fishing, look at this, a trout.  Do you have any fart sounds?  Huh?  No.  See, next time.  Now, don't you worry.  Just get on the mic.  On my show, you will hear farts.  Get on the mic.  Bend over.  By the way, I'm on Manhattan Neighbor Network.  All right.  All right.  Shut up.  Saturday night at.  No, give her the mic.  But tell her to shut up.  Shut up.  57, 1230. 
[01:15:00]  Last time she bent over to show her hemorrhoids, she farted in poor Steve's face.  And he loved it.  All right.  Phil?  Yeah.  Phil?  Yes.  He's a very kinky guy.  He's a very kinky guy.  Apply the ointment.  Look at Phil.  Now, go ahead.  Now, really get in there.  Get a good one.  Oh, my Lord.  All right.  Ready?  I don't believe it.  Give her the mic.  She needs to spread those cheeks.  This never happened before.  I just feel like my act alone.  You see what it's in the show world. 
[01:15:30]  I don't believe you.  Three.  But alone.  All right.  Here we go.  I don't believe it.  Oh, no.  I don't believe it.  No, no, no.  It's the career, Ma.  Don't take it seriously.  That's going to be the best sound ever.  I don't believe it.  You know, the good thing about this is it's going to completely erase the memory of guys  eating rats.  That'll be completely whitewashed from my mind.  I don't believe it.  Yeah, it's very cute, though, so I just...  I got to hear that before we leave. 
[01:16:00]  Are you ready?  Do it already.  Go ahead.  I really would like Jay to do it.  I mean, then I could say someday, Jay Moore touched my hemorrhoid.  All right.  Go ahead.  What action?  Phil, touch her hemorrhoid.  Oh!  Wow.  That just happened.  That just happened.  You're not very gentle. 
[01:16:30]  I don't know.  You're not very gentle.  He went for a good one, that last one.  He gave her a good poke.  That actually happened.  He gave her the poke-erizer.  Oh.  It's not very gentle.  All right.  Hey, is that you okay?  No, that's okay.  Oh, my God.  You look more gentle.  I don't care about any fire hazards.  Start a fire in here right now and burn that glove.  I don't care if the halon goes off.  I'm going to give my turn to Brian.  I'll pass.  I'll pass it alone.  I'll pass it alone.  The password is hemorrhoid. 
[01:17:00]  It goes to Brian.  I'm going to pass.  I'll pass it.  Eh, eh.  All right.  Well, hey.  All right.  I'm so glad that that happened.  Can I go again?  Can I ask you a question?  One more time.  One more time.  Oh, that hemorrhoid must be pretty infected or something, the way you reacted by somebody  touching it.  I think maybe you should seek medical attention.  That guy put his finger on it and he went, oh, like Ted Knight from Caddyshack. 
[01:17:30]  Let's go to the hospital kind of noise.  Oh, you're no gentleman.  You're supposed to be able to apply ointment to a hemorrhoid without going, oh.  How about a fresco?  Absolutely not.  All right.  Listen.  All right.  You want to do one more application?  All right.  One more.  I don't think he got it at all.  Oh, my God.  You're a really good one, Phil.  You want to make it perfectly clear that Brian is not checking this out.  That poor glove, you know, expected to be unwrapped by some nice housewife and washed a few 
[01:18:00]  dishes.  Now the glove's like, why me?  I was sitting on the rack.  I get this.  I thought maybe a couple of teacups and I'd be put away in the cabinet.  And it's all presuppositive.  I don't like preparation, H, personally.  All right.  Let's go.  Ben, let's go.  Phil, show the hemorrhoid.  Oh, jeez.  Phil, make sure.  What are you, Jewish?  Jewish?  Phil, this is going to look good on your resume.  Oh, boy.  It's a real resume stuffer.  What do you do for a living?  Phil, what do you do for a living?  In marketing. 
[01:18:30]  There you go.  Is your mother listening?  I do this to my mother.  All right.  Everyone be quiet.  All right.  Get on mic.  Here's a joke there.  You didn't catch it.  Give us a little countdown.  You're telling it to your mother.  Give us a three, two, one.  Hello.  Hello.  Here we go.  You got...  Oh!  Oh!  Oh.  That's...  That hurts.  That's...  I used two.  You hate women, myself.  This isn't right.  You used two.  Two.  Uh-huh.  See, you hate women. 
[01:19:00]  This is awful.  I can't even take it.  I'm turning myself in.  You hate women?  You hate women.  Did you do something like that?  I'm turning myself in.  Be gentle, man.  I can't take this.  Be gentle.  You're so sure what a woman is.  I'm still a woman, baby.  Brian, again, I apologize for this program.  But we learned a lesson.  If you want to show you like women, don't do what Phil did.  Don't use two fingers. 
[01:19:30]  Fingers.  Man.  You cut your nails now.  She said Phil should cut his nails.  Phil, did you...  Come on, baby.  Phil, because you're on the other side of the room, and I didn't want to witness any of it.  Could you let us know how you used your fingers in the...  I mean, did you actually pen it instead?  Hold on.  Um, what you can say is, did you actually, um, make your fingers disappear?  See, that's how you can say it.  Because what made her go, oh!  But you can't say where. 
[01:20:00]  The Amazo Phil the Magician.  She tried to...  Is in the room with us.  Can I get paralyzed?  Can I do it?  Oh, no.  God.  Poor Brian.  I think we got a full slate.  Phil, did your fingers disappear?  Were you trying to make your fingers disappear?  I was trying to get knuckle deep.  Oh, my God.  That's all right.  I appreciate it.  Phil, did you see the hemorrhoid?  Everyone will come.  I didn't actually see the hemorrhoid, but...  I felt it.  Phil, did you ever watch a doctor's show now? 
[01:20:30]  You're supposed to take the gloves from the bottom.  Pull it over the top.  Over the top.  And not touching anything.  Anything.  Make a fist-like.  Yeah, now pull it over the top, Marcus Welby.  Rub it all over your hair, Phil.  Something dripped.  The glove broke.  The glove broke.  The glove broke.  Well, yeah, the glove broke.  All right.  Like, the virus is airborne.  All right, listen, listen.  That is worse than Ebola right now.  And it could do more damage. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, put that in a jar, and we'll auction it off on eBay.  Yeah, for Patty's rent.  All right, listen, Sandy, we want to thank you for coming by.  That was Sandy.  Very good.  That's a hell of an act you got.  Oh, it's all right.  Can I give one more plug?  How did you plug my rear end up?  I think you've been plugged enough.  Hey, he's gorgeous, Rick.  He didn't seem to enjoy it when the other fellow was trying to plug you.  He's kidding me, Vic Delgado.  Mmm.  What are you doing later?  Let's exchange blood tests.  Um.  Oh.  Or maybe, maybe my hammer. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, thank you.  He's not nice.  You say he smelled his finger, though.  I got, I, are you allowed to say that?  Smelt like a latex living glove.  Just don't say rear, whatever you do.  I mean, it's real wacky.  Stick things in it, but you just can't say it.  You gay guys, eat your heart out.  But anyway, I'm going to be on my own show.  Are you gay?  Are you gay?  Oh, my goodness.  No.  No, but we are willing to work.  My boyfriend did.  Yo, just send us someplace special.  Poor Brian thought the rat sign was bad.  Now it's going to be a big hemorrhoid sign. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, no.  Touch the hemorrhoid.  All right.  Touch the hemorrhoid.  Sandy, you think it's sexy?  Sandy, Sandy Kane.  Sandy, thank you so much.  Final thoughts?  I promise this time I will eat Mexican food before I get on here.  Final thoughts?  Yeah, just everyone watch my show this Saturday night on Channel 57, Manhattan Avid Network.  And on RCN, it's 108 at 1230 Saturday night.  What was that?  All right.  Thank you, Sandy. 
[01:22:30]  Did you say that again?  Hey.  All right.  It's from Jersey.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Sandy.  Sandy Kane.  Thank you very much.  All right.  There we go.  Manhattan Avid Network.  There we go.  Sandy Kane.  The show is going to be on Tuesday night.  Thank you so very much.  Thank you for being here.  Thank you.  Thank you, everybody.  So, Brian, kid party games.  Yes, of course, Sandy.  Yes.  Okay.  That was good.  Yes.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you, Sandy Kane, everybody. 
[01:23:00]  Sandy Kane.  Sandy.  Sandy.  You have exceeded your life.  Okay.  Take your dancing dildo.  Sandy Kane.  I'm in Juggs this month.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Juggs, hemorrhoids.  Hemorrhoids, Juggs.  Singing dildos.  Wonderful.  Lynn Thomas was in Juggs, right?  Oh, no.  Penthouse.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Where does it all go wrong?  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, Sandy Kane.  And she leaves.  She makes the list talker patty. 
[01:23:30]  All right.  You get hanged.  All right.  Brian Regan at Caroline's all-weekend log.  You don't really do any hemorrhoid material, do you, Brian?  But you know how it is, like, when you think of a bit, and then you're worried, does somebody  else do something similar?  It just happened to me.  I'm like, ah, jeez.  That's my act.  Somebody's already covering that whole ground.  All right.  I'm going to give you a chance to leave, Brian, if you want.  Before the next thing comes in. 
[01:24:00]  I don't know what's going to do right at that door.  Right.  It's like, let's make a deal.  You can leave right now, or we can bring in the next guest.  Let's see what's behind the curtain.  Oh, you got zonked.  No whammy, no whammy, no whammy.  Stop.  Oh, Brian.  We're buying the rats and the hemorrhoid, and now we're going to finger some  rat hemorrhoids.  We have to say goodbye to Brian, and we'll be back with our two other contestants. 
[01:24:30]  You should see the signals you're getting behind you from your wife.  Bonus round.  He's like saying, take the out.  Take the out.  Yeah.  I'm going to leave.  All right.  You know, I do got to get ready for this show.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You got a show to do tonight.  Brian Regan.  Had a blast, guys.  Yeah, once again.  Brian effing Regan.  Will you be back tonight when we're all on Ron and Fess?  Yeah, maybe.  Yeah.  Why don't we do that after our Christmas party?  They start at 11, and they go until 3 in the morning.  Yeah.  They got the enema guy that's going to laugh until he... 
[01:25:00]  You'd be a ringer there.  Until he does whatever he does.  Right.  Yeah.  All right.  Oof.  He's one of our faves.  Brian Regan, everyone.  Brian, thank you so much.  He's going to be at Caroline's all weekend long.  Call Caroline's for ticket.  Brian, I apologize for steamrolling in on your interview, but...  Jay, I love having you in here, man.  I love your stuff, so I wanted to come by and hear it because I wanted to laugh my ass off.  Thank you.  All right.  For reservations, 212-757-4100.  Brian Regan in the house.  Logan. 
[01:25:30]  Bethany.  You guys sometimes, like, piss me off, okay?  Wuddle-lay, wuddle-lay, wuddle-doodle-doodle-doodle.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W-N-E-W. </pre>
