<pre> Good enough diploma. That's right.  You just bailed?  You just bailed though?  Well no, I just finished up the good old 9th grade.  Wow. See kids, you don't need school.  Just quit, grab your guitar and hit the road.  And be just like Johnny Lang.  I'm going to have every mother after him in New York City.  You know what the strange thing is though, sometimes that just happens.  Sometimes you don't have to finish school and you do pretty well. 
[00:30]
 See, you did. But that's the exception to the rule.  Yeah, but I'm stupid. See, you don't want to be stupid.  There are side effects.  Now when you were three you wanted to be Michael Jackson and Mr. T.  Oh definitely.  Why Michael Jackson?  Well I've kind of got my Mr. T starter kit on here.  Yeah, I see that. That is the starter kit.  Yeah, I don't know. I love Michael Jackson. He's like my biggest influence.  I'm sure he'd love you too. 
[01:00]
 Hence me cutting my hair.  Why don't you come over here Johnny Lang?  Oh man, enough.  So how did you get together with Buddy Guy? How did that come about?  Gosh, I met him at his club in Chicago. We played there and he came to watch us one night.  It was just shaking. I was so nervous and I met him after the show.  Since then we've become friends and now we're on a tour with each other. 
[01:30]
 You've played with some big people. Aerosmith recently, The Stones, Blues Traveler.  Any of those guys teach anything cool?  Oh, every night man.  Who has the better groupies? The Stones or Aerosmith?  That's hard to say. I don't know man.  I would say Aerosmith.  Yeah, Aerosmith has got the whip it out Wednesday crowd.  Did you do a beer with Keith Richards or anything?  No, but I pulled up to their tune up room and went back there and hung with them for a second. 
[02:00]
 It was pretty cool.  Were you just sitting there going, oh my God, that's Keith Richards.  It was crazy and all it was was just this slur of cockney English.  I couldn't understand it.  And then I introduced him to my mom.  Oh, mom, I'll take a cab. I'm on the road.  Give him a cigarette.  It was crazy. I was looking for the martini in Ron's hand.  That is her whole look.  Smooth. 
[02:30]
 A lot of people have fax questions.  We asked that one, we asked that one.  No, we asked that one.  Wait, what's that drawing?  This is you. Someone drew you.  Oh my God.  With a haircut up here.  Johnny, when is your next album coming out? That's coming out in October, right?  October 6th, yeah.  I hear that there's a song with Prince on there possibly.  It's a Prince tune that he never released.  My producer David Zee and him and some other guy wrote it. 
[03:00]
 You actually hung out with Prince for a while.  No, I've never met the guy.  I was going to ask.  He's one of my biggest influences too. I really wanted to meet him.  I've heard him living in some place like Batman though.  It's like a bat cave.  He's really disguised. You don't really know you're talking to him while you're talking to him.  He slides down the bat pole and he's Prince.  The purple pole.  Oh, yeah.  Alright.  We'll get away from that. 
[03:30]
 This is actually an interesting question.  Blues music is often referred to as music that is best performed by those who have paid their dues.  This guy wants to know, Johnny Lang, have you paid your dues?  I've paid my union dues every year.  You've paid a toll coming in.  I don't know. I'm kind of a farm boy. I grew up on a farm.  I drove a combine.  Really?  Got a couple knuckle busters on a wrench one time.  I've been in some pain and agony. 
[04:00]
 I broke my knuckles on a wrench.  Also, someone asked, did you listen to Stevie Ray Vaughan growing up?  Oh, definitely.  Stevie's awesome. We miss Stevie.  Yeah, no kidding. He was amazing.  Alright. One more question before we get into the imaginary ballroom.  This is the only question we could ask. The rest of the ones from the females are really dirty and bad.  That looks like a long question.  That's not too bad. My girlfriends all want to know your real birthday and the time of your birth so they can chart him astrologically and find out what his sex planets are in. 
[04:30]
 Wow.  Well, I've been known to be on several different planets at one point.  Tell your exact time.  January 29th, 1981, 443 a.m.  There you go. That'll help someone out there.  I think I was actually passed out in a bar on that same date. 
[05:00]
 Anthony turned 30 on that day.  Come on.  I did not.  I have my social security card too.  Alright, you ready to play some tunes in the imaginary ballroom?  Should I quick run over there or are you guys going to cut to a commercial?  Actually, we'll take the cab over to the imaginary ballroom.  I'll get the chandeliers lit.  Yeah.  No, we'll give you time so we can light the candles and stuff in the ballroom for you. Get you in the mood, alright?  Okay.  We'll do it in a few minutes.  1027WNEW where rock lives. Jimi Hendrix on two for Tuesday. It's Opie and it's Anthony. 
[05:30]
 We just wanted to jump on the radio real fast to thank Johnny Lang for stopping by the imaginary ballroom.  Great job, man.  Unbelievable job playing with Buddy Guy tonight at the Hammerstein Ballroom.  And the facts are coming in like crazy. He did that song, Hit the Ground Running, off his Lie to Me CD.  And this fact came in.  I think I just broke my vibrator on Hit the Ground Running, man.  People enjoy that tremendously.  Things going on, man.  Now, what did he say about cutting his hair? You were talking to him after the performance? 
[06:00]
 Yeah. Well, I asked him how long he cut his hair, how long ago, and he said six months.  Yeah.  I said it must have been one of those decisions you really toil over.  He was like, no, when you look at a picture of yourself on stage and you look just like Shania Twain, it's time to cut your hair.  Oh, man. Very cool. He was very, very cool. He's still wandering around here somewhere.  Maybe we'll get him on the radio again here in a few minutes. You never know.  Never know.  You never know who's going to stop him by the end of the show.  He's fun. He's funny. 
[06:30]
 Let's rock on with Two for Tuesday. We got two from REM on N.E.W.  1027W, N.E.W., The Rock of New York, the Brian Setzer Orchestra, Jump, Jive, and Whale on Two for Tuesday.  And those guys were in the Imaginary Ballroom two weeks ago.  Sounded great, and we had Johnny Lang about a half hour ago.  Unbelievable.  Kicked the ass.  Absolutely kicked the ass. I hope you were listening to the radio about 45 minutes ago.  He did three songs for us, Lie to Me, Rack Them Up, and Hit the Ground Running all off his Lie to Me CD. 
[07:00]
 And then we get a goofy listener calling up going,  You guys just broke the format. It's supposed to be Two for Tuesday, and Johnny played three songs. Do I win any money?  No.  No. Never satisfied.  He's pretty good, man. And he doesn't have that rock star attitude thing going.  Not at all.  Which is great.  A message to all bands that are going to come into the N.E.W. studio.  Leave the rock and roll attitude, the rock star attitude at home, and come in here and hang out with us and have some fun. 
[07:30]
 Yeah. Johnny walks in, sits down, starts talking. He was really, really cool.  That's it.  I felt like I was talking to a 30-year-old guy, too. The guy, he's only 17 years old. It's hard to imagine.  And just so down to earth and real. We like that here at N.E.W.  And then with that whole attitude, yeah, man, you know, we got the album coming out, man.  Too cool for the room.  Right.  No. Just hang, sit and talk with us.  And we had a little excitement in the N.E.W. studios today. Now look, this is what's amazing about this place. 
[08:00]
 Now we're back to us.  But we're getting there, though. Every once in a while you see a little bit of life.  And then a burst of excitement.  A burst of excitement. And then it goes back to how it usually, watch, watch, watch.  Hey, where did everyone go? Is Johnny here? Hello?  No, gone.  Gone. Those hallways were filled with people only 15, 20 minutes ago. And now it's you and I again.  That's how it goes, man. 
[08:30]
 And I think that guy Ben that works with us from 3 to 7, somewhere down the hallways.  But there you go. But a little excitement into your life today. All right.  On the way, we got some more two-fers for you. Want to do some in excess? We can do that.  We'll do a request and we'll do Collective Soul next. Stay there.  1027 WNEW where Rock lives, two for Tuesday with Collective Soul.  And that's Jell also in there, shy.  That's Ophi and Anthony on the only radio station in New York not giving you a chance to win Powerball.  I hate Powerball. I'll sing the Powerball. Powerball, Powerball, Powerball. 
[09:00]
 Stupid radio stations all over Manhattan. Call in, be the tenth caller.  We're going to give you a chance at a quarter billion dollars every one.  Now people are going to call thinking you're giving them away.  We're not giving away that crap. We're not buying the myth. It's a stupid radio contest.  Any station that's doing that should be ashamed of themselves.  News just in. I just got a thing off the wire.  The mayor of Greenwich, Connecticut has ordered his police force to start firing on cars with New York Place. 
[09:30]
 He is blockading the city calling in the National Guard tanks to go to all the exits on 95.  And shoot to kill are his orders right now. So if you're going up there to buy your Powerball tickets, get a flak jacket.  Do you realize the lines are up to four hours long to get a Powerball ticket in Connecticut?  Now you're hearing the stories about people that are a little ticked off waiting on these lines.  All of a sudden New Yorkers, we can't get home. I-95 is a nightmare. Mary Parkway is a nightmare. 
[10:00]
 They're saying the furries out in Port Jeff in Orient Point, nightmare, because everyone's jumping on the furries.  Powerball.  To get to Connecticut to get their Powerball tickets.  The trains out of Grand Central Station, they are just bringing people up to Connecticut to get their Powerball tickets.  It has nothing to do with rush hour anymore.  You know why? Because you got to be in it to shut up.  Exactly. I'm sorry, Eddie Hugh.  You read some of these little stats?  Well, it's worth what? Is it up to about a trillion dollars at this point? Is anyone keeping track? What is it? 
[10:30]
 $300 billion million dollars?  Well, you can take one payment and after taxes it's $82.50. $82.  Exactly.  How about this though? $80.1 million to one odds of winning.  Of winning.  Yes. You're far more likely to be electrocuted, killed by an animal, die by poisoning, die of a surgery, 
[11:00]
 be killed in a fall from bed, be killed in a fall from bed, or even freezing to death.  You're more likely to have those happen to you than win.  You have a better chance of being hit on the head by a giant crane.  Oh, wait a minute.  We had a winner here in New York.  We had a winner in this thing.  But in the daily news they're giving advice to the person that's going to win the billion dollars or whatever it's up to.  We need your advice.  They tell you how to deal with people. They tell you how to deal with people if you win the Powerball.  Shoot all your relatives. 
[11:30]
 Right.  That's the first thing you would have to do, I would think.  And leave the country.  By your own country.  And then it has this section in the daily news on what not to do if you win the Powerball.  Listen to this poor sap. In 1988 Buddy Post won $16.2 million.  With his middle name dumb as a.  Right. He won $16.2 million in the Pennsylvania lottery.  Now he's near broke.  His sixth wife left him. His brother was convicted of trying to kill him.  And his landlady sued him for one third of the jackpot.  She won. 
[12:00]
 The crumbling mansion he bought with his winnings is half filled with paperwork from bankruptcy proceedings.  And then they go on to talk about Curtis Sharpe.  Oh yeah, Curtis Sharpe. Remember him? He used to be in a...  Yeah, that was a New York State lottery winner.  Yeah, it was.  And he used to be on the commercials going,  I won $5 million.  And he used to wear the derby hat and everything.  Yeah.  And he was one of the $5 million winners.  Now he's collecting change at Special Park because he didn't know what to do with his basic rules.  Oh no, Curtis.  Curtis.  So, well, good luck to you and... 
[12:30]
 Good luck everybody.  Good luck everyone.  Hey, hey, we're taking your phone calls. What would you do with $250 million?  Lucky DJ. Are you tired of the way radio guys are treating us?  All the other radio stations giving away tickets to the big drawing.  I hope we're not doing it here when we're not in the air.  We're giving you nothing and you'll like it.  Oh, good. Good to hear.  Also, in the news, what's going on with Randy Johnson?  Yeah.  The Yankees really trying to get Randy Johnson, the big guy?  You know something, Yankees? Leave everything alone. 
[13:00]
 Don't mess with the chemistry. George Steinbrenner, he's never satisfied this guy.  I'll tell you one thing. It's bad enough when a team goes on to win a championship,  no matter what sport it is.  And then the next year the team's back and it's not the same team.  It's bad enough when that happens.  Don't screw with the team during the season. Could you leave everything alone?  George, leave the team alone.  You're a big unit.  George's?  No. George.  Yeah, George. 
[13:30]
 George's, okay.  All right. More runs.  And finally, the home run race getting very exciting.  Yes.  McGuire has 44, Griffey 40, and Sammy hit two more yesterday. He's up to 40.  Who do you think is going to win the home run race?  I'm still going with Griffey.  I know, it's up in the air.  I'm still going with Griffey.  Griffey.  Yeah.  I think McGuire's going to pull out his back once again this year and disappoint all of us.  He's been shooting for this record for the last five or six years on his own.  He always ends up hurting himself doing something stupid.  Cranky's late tonight in Anaheim. 
[14:00]
 Yeah, I know. They'll win.  Wow, the phones are going crazy. I think these are all the people that have their Powerball tickets.  No, they're not.  No, they will be. Those are people that want to try to win Powerball tickets.  They thought we were actually real wacky DJs.  Isn't that right, WAP WAP?  Yeah, that's right.  Wack, Mack.  Alright, two for Tuesday. We got two from NXS next.  1027WNEW, the Rock of New York. Two for Tuesday. NXS, Suicide Blonde and Bitter Tears as you hang with OP and Anthony. 
[14:30]
 Hey, got some good news. We got the rescheduled dates for the Aerosmith shows.  Ooh.  As you know, Joey Kramer's still recuperating from the burns he received when he was filling up his Ferrari.  Actually, he was in the vehicle, right?  Yes, he was. He was going to get fueled up.  He says shut ignition off before fueling.  Yes, he learned the hard way. That burns all over the place. They had to cancel some tour dates and then they finally rescheduled, which is cool.  Now, if you got tickets for the original dates, you could use them at the new dates. 
[15:00]
 Okay.  Or if you can't go, then you just go to where you purchased your tickets and get your refund. Does that make sense?  Yes.  Okay, so if you got tickets for the August 26th show at Jones Beach, the new date will be October 13th.  Jones Beach gets cold August 2nd. There are shows you go there in August and it gets a little chilly at night near the water.  Bring a sweater, October. Wow.  Yes, August 28th at Jones Beach, the new date is October 15th. And if you got tickets for the PNC Bank Arts Center, the original date was August 30th. 
[15:30]
 Well, that has been rescheduled for Saturday, October 17th.  And we have all that info for you here at the NEW studios.  Cool.  There you go. A lot of people talking about Monica Lewinsky. You had to show me the front page of the post again.  I had sex with the president.  With Bill.  With Bill.  I'm just a little perplexed with some of the headlines.  Huh?  Well, some of the headlines that these news organizations are putting out. 
[16:00]
 All right.  Reuters, very reputable news agency. Lewinsky to testify in legal blow to Clinton.  They just got to do it, right?  Of course they do.  Christian Science Monitor. Probes of Clinton have caused the squeezing of the presidency.  And the Sydney Morning Herald. Star's tentacles tighten round Clinton.  Is it me?  Very nice. Well, earlier in the show we had Tom Brokenjaw. 
[16:30]
 Yes, we did.  On the show to break the news for us.  You want to hear that again?  He's a very reputable news guy, sure.  Hello, Tom Brokaw here.  1027WNAW where rock lives, two for Tuesday with Peter Gabriel. Music's sounding great today, huh?  That's DIY and shock the monkey. It's Opie and Anthony.  She's not afraid to take her clothes off.  What are you looking at?  Wow.  What are you looking at?  What?  What are you looking at?  Oh, Rolling Stone.  So, what's the big deal? 
[17:00]
 Look at the cover of the new Rolling Stone.  Oh my Lord!  That's Playboy, that's not Rolling Stone.  I know.  Wow, this year's model, Letitia Costa. Oh, look at the inside.  When did Rolling Stone start getting centerfold?  I don't know, this is like swank.  It's a centerfold. She's completely naked.  She's not wearing anything, not even an ankle bracelet.  If you're walking by a newsstand, you've got to check out the latest issue of Rolling Stone. 
[17:30]
 She's beautiful.  She's the new Victoria's Secret model, the new hot Vicky Secret.  My sister works there.  I know, let's get her on the phone and see if she has any info on this lady.  Maybe she can get her in here.  That would be nice too.  Oh my God.  Look at Rolling Stone.  Maybe their publication is dropping because now they've got naked women on the cover.  Naked women on the cover, they know what sells.  Sex doesn't sell whatsoever.  Matter of fact, you were telling me on the way in today, Ant, that wrestling is starting to use sex to sell too. 
[18:00]
 Remember when wrestling used to be thinking of the bad guys and the good guys, like Hulk Hogan, I guess.  Well, my wrestling days go back to Bruno Sammartino and Cheap D. Strongbow.  I remember watching once and Cheap J. Strongbow was Bruno Sammartino's tag team partner.  And all of a sudden out of nowhere Cheap J. Strongbow takes a chair and slams it over the head of Bruno Sammartino.  When did Cheap J. Strongbow become a bad guy? 
[18:30]
 It would crush you when your favorite wrestler turned into a bad guy in the old days.  What's up with Ernie Lad in that thumb? He's had a cast on that thumb for ten years.  He used to poke people in the eye.  And then they went through the phase like the Hulk Hogan phase of wrestling where Hulk was like, hey, I'm a good guy.  Hey kids, eat your vegetables and you'll be strong like the Hulkster. 
[19:00]
 And he wrestled the bad guys like the Iranian Sheik.  Iron Sheik?  The Iron Sheik.  Of course.  And who was the guy, Mr. Fuji?  He used to throw the sand in the people's eyes.  Why didn't they check Mr. Fuji for sand every time he came to the ring?  He's going to have the sand.  Check him for sand.  You couldn't understand how stupid the refs were but we were even stupider because there wasn't time we believed in this.  Now it's of course called sport entertainment. 
[19:30]
 Obviously, yes, they're athletes and everything but it's pretty scripted.  But now the WWF is, I mean it's sex.  There are kids in the audience that are eight years old, ten, twelve, and for this last pay-per-view thing they did, I saw a clip of it.  Sable, this blonde bombshell.  She's got like 38 triple D's.  Comes out into the ring because she's doing this bikini contest with this other girl. 
[20:00]
 And she takes her top off.  She took her top off.  She had paint on her nippies.  That's it.  That's all she had.  And she had eight, ten, twelve year old kids.  They're just going wild.  What t-shirt God does basically.  It's unbelievable without the t-shirt.  It was wild.  And now there's no good guys either.  It's just varying degrees of bad guys.  They got of course Stone Cold Steve Austin. 
[20:30]
 I'm going to open up a can of whoop ass on you.  He's always telling Vince McMahon, the head of the WWF, who now feels he's got to be involved in wrestling.  He used to be the guy behind the scenes.  He's in the ring now every time.  And all the wrestlers, I flip him the bird.  Like Stone Cold, how about I put my foot in your ass?  And then he flips him the bird.  So when Vince, who is the head of a multi-million, probably billion dollar organization, walks out of the ring,  he's got to walk up this little ramp where eight, nine, and ten year old children are flipping him the bird. 
[21:00]
 Just like Stone Cold Steve Austin.  I want to be like Stone Cold F you mom.  Boom, hit him in the face with a chair.  And they hit people with chairs.  Right over the head.  Well wrestling is getting out of hand because now Jay Leno is getting involved in one of these pay-per-views.  Well that's absolutely correct.  They call me the chin is what they call me.  And to a move it's like an elbow slam but it's with my chin.  Did you see him? 
[21:30]
 He had Hulk Hogan and Dennis Rodman.  Right and the milkman.  Oh my God.  It's just getting out of hand.  Did Jay Leno one already happen?  Yes, I put the cleft of my chin over my opponent and I choked him with my big chin.  I don't know what he was doing.  The chin move.  The chin move.  He's embarrassing.  Very nice.  But it's all sex now so don't give us any flack.  It's like prime time.  All the kids are watching it.  It's amazing.  Hey we're coming back with a twofer from Alice in Chains. 
[22:00]
 Whoa.  Whoa.  Hey hold it.  Stay there.  1027WNEW the Rock of New York Twofer Tuesday with Mad Season River of Deceit and Alice  in Chains before that.  No excuses.  The common denominator there.  Lane Staley of course.  I hit the mic up and I'm laughing.  I know.  I'm sorry about that.  Lane Staley down to 48 pounds last night check.  Oh stop.  He is.  He's like Mr. Heroin guy.  Well Alice in Chains is one of my favorite bands of all time.  Believe it or not.  Of all time.  I know that sounds pretty crazy but they've got some great stuff. 
[22:30]
 And I'm so sick of hearing the Lane Staley rumors on the internet and when you're talking  to people and stuff.  It's like dude my friend you're going to be the first one to hear that.  I'm like what?  I'm going to be the first one to hear that.  I'm going to be the first one to hear that.  He is in bad shape from what they're saying.  Well I just hope the band can pump out a new album. 
[23:00]
