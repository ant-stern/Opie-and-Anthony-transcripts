<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly between subjects and consistently employing offensive language and sexually suggestive humor. The show began with a reaction to a Time Magazine article by Joel Stein criticizing their show. Opie and Anthony vehemently disagreed with Stein's portrayal of their show, particularly his depiction of their workplace, their interactions with women, and the "Whip Them Out Wednesdays" segment.  Stein himself called in to participate in a heated debate.  The hosts then transitioned to a discussion of a movie about a mentally disabled man, which quickly devolved into offensive jokes about people with intellectual disabilities, using derogatory terms like "retard" and "mongoloid."  A caller shared a story about a woman with a Down Syndrome daughter, further fueling this offensive commentary.

A significant portion of the show featured Spaz, a regular caller, discussing a scene in his recent stage play involving explicit sexual contact.  This was followed by an extended, highly critical segment focused on Earl, a WNEW employee, who was ridiculed for taking a long time to hang eight pictures in the station's lobby. The hosts and other staff members (Pete, Eddie, Mark, Ben, and Dan), along with callers including Dave and "Nigga Charlie," engaged in increasingly absurd and offensive accusations about the picture-hanging process.  Earl's perceived inefficiency and a purported pubic hair on one of the pictures became the focus of extended mockery.

Garrett Morris then joined the show. The conversation shifted to various unrelated topics: a news story about girls swept away by a riptide (prompting a song from Morris), a man-boob contest, Morris’s work on *Martin*, and a dispute over the origin of the phrase "What's up?".  Sandy Kane was brought into the studio, and the hosts engaged in sexually suggestive and crude jokes involving her.  Morris discussed being shot, and his negative reaction to the hosts' laughter regarding his spinal cord injury was noted. Further discussion about race and the hosts’ behavior towards Morris ensued. Rick, a co-host with blonde hair, became the target of jokes about his appearance and sexual orientation, with Old Dirty Bastard adding homophobic remarks.

A news story about a masseuse sexually assaulting clients at a Long Island spa led to a caller, Katie, recounting her experience and Jim Norton sharing an extremely detailed and explicit account of his own unwanted sexual experience with a male masseuse.  The show then tackled Jesse Jackson's extramarital affair and the birth of a love child.  The hosts and callers (Earl and Pete) used highly offensive and vulgar language to discuss Jackson's hypocrisy and speculated about the financial compensation given to the child's mother.  Comparisons were made to Bill Clinton's sex scandals. The segment concluded with a humorous and sarcastic phone call with Reverend Allen, who was on a hunger strike in prison, and further speculation about Jackson's actions. The broadcast ended with the hosts teasing the upcoming WNEW fall lineup.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie, Anthony, Opie, Anthony, Opie, Anthony, 1027, WNEW.  If you're listening to us on WNEW, you can call 877-692-1027.  Everywhere else, it's 866-277-4WOW.  Or 866-AS-4WOW.  Not ASK-A-S.  No.  A-S-S.  ASS-4WOW.  Nice.  866-277-4WOW. 
[00:00:30]  Jeez.  Craig, what's going on?  I just read a Time Magazine article.  Yeah.  Can we talk a little more about Breck?  Yeah.  It shows you have a very good show.  But in the end, it ends saying when we have a gay person on and he's articulate and doesn't have too gay a voice, we give him an open forum.  And Opie's looking into a moment of earnestness, then he snaps out of it. 
[00:01:00]  Then we call him a fag and bring on the next stripper.  Yeah.  We're going to get into the whole article now.  Yeah, that's cool.  All right, Craig.  Thank you.  Okay.  Bye.  Yeah, I don't think many of our listeners are happy with the Time article.  Ben, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  It's Ben.  Hey.  When I first heard you guys say Joel Stein, I was pretty psyched because he writes some pretty funny stuff.  Yeah.  This article was a huge little bucket of elitist crap about the show.  He's so much better than you guys.  Yeah, it's kind of sad because we really had a good time with Joel Stein when he came by here. 
[00:01:30]  We sat in the conference room.  We talked forever about a lot of different things.  We talked to him about the TNA on the show.  We talked to him about Howard Stern.  We talked about some of the more clever things we do on the radio.  And I don't know, man.  It's obvious he had an agenda when he came in here.  He's usually right.  Like I'm telling you, the entire magazine is pretty much the only funny thing.  And he said in an article a couple weeks ago that his whole job is to write fart jokes.  Right.  And now he's coming down on you guys. 
[00:02:00]  Right.  You know what it is also?  Like I said, we were hanging out.  We did an interview with him.  And everything we talked about in the interview pretty much put what we do on the show in context.  You know, we talked about what we do, how we do it, why we do it here on the air.  But he didn't really write about that.  He just wrote about what you see or what the listener would perceive as they're listening to the show.  Never really getting into the ins and outs of the whole thing.  The thing is, he usually writes at either the end where he does a little short interview or else in the beginning where he has his own little spin on things. 
[00:02:30]  This is like a straight up article.  So I think he was trying to do like some serious stuff or something because.  Yeah, I don't know what he was getting at because the show is many textures and he chose to write about one of the textures, which is the TNA and the breasts.  He's probably just pissed because you kicked him out of the studio.  I'm thinking that now.  Maybe I shouldn't have kicked him out.  He's the one that you kicked out?  Oh, yeah.  I'm trying to remember.  I looked him right in the face.  I said, you know, you're making us uncomfortable.  Right.  Okay.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  I lose track of the people we kick out and don't kick out. 
[00:03:00]  But you can't, you know, you can't take it personally.  We have a show to do.  Rolling Stone guy, we didn't kick out, right?  No, not at all.  Who else didn't we kick out?  New York Magazine.  New York Magazine didn't kick him out.  No.  All right.  We did kick this guy out.  We kicked out Joel Stein from Time and we kicked out the guy from Brill's Content.  Yeah.  Because some of the guys that make us nervous, they're sitting in here the whole time and we go for a cup of coffee or a glass of water and they pick up their pens real fast.  Yeah.  They start jotting things down.  So you want to go through this article?  I'm pretty psyched that we're in Time Magazine. 
[00:03:30]  That looks great.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I think it's pretty damn cool.  It's a magazine I could finally bring home to my parents.  Yeah.  The penthouse was a little rough.  We were in the penthouse, what, in January?  And, you know, we had an article in there between a fisting scene and what was it?  Golden showers.  The golden shower scene.  Yeah.  And we had to take that.  It was right around the holidays.  So bringing that over to Grandma's house with the family over for Christmas was really nice.  Just don't go back one page, Grandma.  And once you get to the end of the article, see, I taped the rest of the magazine shut. 
[00:04:00]  Don't try to open it.  Article's over.  You'll see stuff you haven't seen since the 40s.  Right, right.  But this one we can bring home.  Yeah.  So I'm pretty psyched about that.  It's the latest issue of Time, July 23rd.  There's an ape on the cover.  Amal.  Hey, Hopi, Anthony.  What's going on, man?  What's up, Amal?  These guys, this film guy's douchebag.  He's a tool.  It's a rock and roll show.  It's a roller coaster, man.  He's a f***er.  Hey. 
[00:04:30]  Sorry, sorry, sorry.  Hey.  Wow, that was long before our first curse dump.  That happened in the first five minutes of the show.  Hey, guys, I came here three years ago from India, and I'm your biggest fan, man.  I listen to you guys like a god.  You guys are awesome.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Thank you, Amal.  Love you guys.  All right.  All right, bye.  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I went and got this magazine.  First of all, $5 for this piece of crap.  But, um, Hopi, you look like the chick in Midnight Express. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, Billy.  Well, that was the photographer.  Let me tell you something about the picture.  Yeah.  The photographer that came in here was a madman, a lunatic.  Like, I didn't understand what he was doing.  He didn't know what he was doing.  He didn't.  He goes, let's just take pictures that are crazy.  We'll take pictures that are crazy.  You get behind the glass.  I take pictures.  It would be crazy.  And we're like, well, and you could tell this was the one where we're going, oh, look  how crazy we are behind the glass.  I got to tell you, we've been lucky enough to have a bunch of photo shoots lately. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  And most of the people that come by, like, we have Rolling Stone magazine right outside the  studio.  They're coming in to snap some shots in a couple of minutes here.  Uh-huh.  I got to say, when the photographers come in here, they all know what they want to do  and what they want to shoot.  Right.  The guy from Time had no effing clue.  Not a clue.  We suggested we go behind this glass.  It's like a glass partition between the waiting area of the studio and, like, the engineering  section of the place.  And we're pressed up against the glass. 
[00:06:00]  And Anthony's got, like, a microphone wrapped around his neck because he decided he was going  to just be crazy for the photographer.  You know what that mic around my neck is for?  Oh, that's because we were taping him.  It was connected to a DAT recorder.  Right.  Because we wanted to get some of this guy talking because he was just a madman.  That's right.  But it didn't work.  Right.  But that's the only reason I have this around my neck.  I couldn't possibly imagine that we're going to use this picture.  Right.  Well, they did.  I mean, there's a mic cord around your neck with a mic just hanging there.  You're in the middle of talking, which is like any photographer knows you just don't 
[00:06:30]  ever use those pictures.  I was saying, oh, look how crazy we are behind the glass.  Right.  And then we told them to put the mic on the other side of the glass window and make it  look like we're trying to get at the mics, but we can't.  Right.  And what does the glass represent?  Oh, I get that.  Yes, it's crazy.  Right.  We were just goofing with the guy and fooling around, and he ends up using that shot.  Yeah.  So the shot is weird.  And the little caption that goes along with the photograph, it says, bye, mom. 
[00:07:00]  Opie Wright and Anthony have dirty talked their way into some serious money.  Dirty talked.  What does bye, mom mean?  I don't know.  Maybe the photographer could explain that to us.  What does?  You know, I didn't even read that.  Bye, mom.  Bye, mom.  Okay.  Are we supposed to be in prison?  It doesn't look like a prison.  It doesn't look like prison.  It looks like an engineering room.  Right.  Oh, my God.  It says, bye, mom.  Opie Wright and Anthony have dirty talked their way into some serious money. 
[00:07:30]  I bet they had a different picture with this caption, and then they used this one instead.  Didn't change the little caption.  All right.  You want to go through this, Ann?  Yeah.  All right.  So it's Time Magazine, July 23rd.  It came out today with the ape on the cover.  We're on page 69 with a really wacky, goofy picture.  And the title of the article says it all, really.  Can we talk a little more about breasts? 
[00:08:00]  Shock Jocks, Opie, and Anthony go national.  Starts off by saying, you might not think people would choose to listen to conversations in a frat house.  Yet every afternoon, Opie and Anthony spend four hours calling each other gay, drooling over hot moms, and barraging women to whip them out.  Barraging women to whip them out.  What is that?  Barraging women?  That means forcing it.  Yeah.  We do not force women to do that.  So, false right there.  We've always said that, you know, if the ladies feel like it, they can whip them out if they see wow written on the backs of cars all over the place. 
[00:08:30]  Right.  And we've told the guys never harass the ladies, don't follow the ladies.  Just, you know, put the wow on and see what happens.  Right, you are, Greg Opie Hughes.  Yeah.  Name I haven't used in years, but whatever.  They feel like they really know you if they get your real name in.  Right.  It's not even a carefully constructed frat chat.  An hour before airtime, six staff members, all guys, sit around watching Jackass, shooting baskets, and occasionally surfing news websites.  They're less like people preparing for a radio show than people waiting for a pizza. 
[00:09:00]  I agree with that.  It pretty much is.  He was in there.  He saw what goes on before the show.  We pretty much just hang out.  Yeah, but that's an hour before airtime, which is a lot different.  We're just kind of getting our heads together, really, at that point.  If we're not prepared for the show by then, then we'll never be.  I like that he says it's not a carefully constructed frat chat, though.  No, we're just a bunch of guys kind of hanging.  Right.  The office, this is hilarious.  The office, and I kind of got a chuckle out of this.  I'm like, okay, this is going to be a fun article. 
[00:09:30]  The office even looks like a frat house.  Porno tapes line the bookshelves.  True.  So, Opie's desk littered with such research material as Maxim, FHM, Stuff, and Seventeen.  Seventeen.  I do not.  Maybe that day there was a...  It was, yeah.  Yeah, but I don't subscribe to that.  It just happened to be there.  I also have Time and Newsweek.  Yeah, he didn't mention that.  I have Playboy and Penthouse.  Just about every magazine that's out, we go through.  Yeah.  But he chose to mention those. 
[00:10:00]  It's flanked by two Britney Spears posters.  Yeah, you do have two Britney Spears posters by your desk.  Yeah, but that's for the whole office.  It just happens to be in my section.  Anthony's desk, littered with a Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen book, video, and t-shirt,  sits under a poster of the twins.  Now, that's not true either.  He basically makes it look like that's the only thing you have on your desk is like a shrine to the Olsen twins.  Well, it's one of the things I have on my desk.  And the poster, I don't have the poster over my desk. 
[00:10:30]  The poster of the Planet of the Apes movie is over my desk.  The Mary Kate and Ashley one is over the Jägermeister machine.  Right.  And what's up with the Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen book, video, and t-shirt?  Someone had sent them to me, and they were just sitting on my desk.  And that's all you have on your desk?  I have a huge monitor.  I got video games all over the place.  Papers.  Yeah, there's a bunch of stuff.  Not like, yeah, that's all that's on my desk is Mary Kate and Ashley stuff. 
[00:11:00]  Sits under a poster of the twins.  And then the first quote of the article.  This is after we talked to him for an hour and a half upstairs.  None of that stuff is in this article.  Here's the first quote.  Look how hot they're getting.  And that's an old picture, Anthony says.  On further inspection, he dismisses Mary Kate as the priss.  Ashley is the goer.  That's what I say.  Ashley's the goer.  That is the first quote from Anthony in our Time article. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  You were talking about the Ashley twist.  Look how hot they're getting, and Ashley's the goer.  Mary Kate doesn't look like the goer in that poster.  What happened to all the other stuff that we talked about upstairs before he came down to the office to check out the scene?  Nothing we talked about upstairs is in this article.  Period.  Nothing.  Nothing.  And he writes it like you were serious about it, too, you know?  Yeah.  Look how hot they're getting.  Look how hot they're getting.  I just spank out batches by the day at these hot posters. 
[00:12:00]  And that's an old picture, Anthony says.  Of Mary Kate and Ashley.  On further inspection, he dismisses Mary Kate as the priss.  Ashley is the goer.  You're just fooling around trying to make the guy feel comfortable because he's in our environment with a bunch of guys hanging out.  Opie, no.  That's how I feel.  All right.  It continues.  The entire country will have a chance to hear what guys talk about when they're trying really hard to sound like guys.  Infinity Broadcasting, the radio arm of Viacom, this month began syndicating the Opie and Anthony show based in New York City to such cities as Chicago, Dallas, and Philadelphia. 
[00:12:30]  And we'll soon have them on about 20 stations.  Viacom hopes O&A can duplicate their rating success in New York where they are often number one in their prime demographic, men 25 to 49.  There's another false right there.  It's not often.  We're always number one, men 25 to 49.  Always, always, always.  And by a long shot, you idiot, Joel Stein.  Whoa.  God.  I used to believe everything I wrote or saw or heard until I got into this business. 
[00:13:00]  They don't even do the basic research.  Yeah.  Number one in their prime demographic, men 25 to 49.  Greg Opie Hughes.  Greg Opie Hughes.  He looks like Opie from the Andy Griffith Show.  And Anthony Cumia are the descendants of Howard Stern, replacing his sour transgressiveness with male real, real, real politic.  Real politic.  Real politic.  Real.  But I don't know what he means by that. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  While Stern interviews strippers, O&A just want them to take off their clothes.  Uh, what?  Well, that's one thing we do.  Sure.  There's no reason to interview a stripper.  You know, they're here for one reason.  Let's check it out and let's move on.  And take video and pictures and make sure our listeners can see it, too.  I mean, that's, you know, that's the part, uh, he missed.  All right.  Uh, Viacom also syndicates the flagging Stern, who is no fan of O&A and vice versa.  That's not really true.  That's not totally true either. 
[00:14:00]  And we explained, we talked about Howard Stern in this, with this reporter, Joel Stein, for a long time.  And this is what he chooses to, uh, print, which is unfortunate.  He's been working off the same formula for a long time.  Here's a girl, get naked, hoo, hoo, hoo, says Opie.  It's the same midgets, the same pinheads.  For today's society, you have to keep things interesting.  Mm-hmm.  Man, did he paraphrase something there.  Yeah, that's like two sentences.  Interesting isn't always tasteful, as when Jay Moore, the actor, comedian, and frequent guest, sang the song, 
[00:14:30]  Full Blown AIDS, making fun of AIDS patients.  What?  We never even discussed that with Joel.  Where did he get that from?  Because that was Jay and Steven, and it was like a, Mike Dina Cola.  I mean, we had a lot of people in the studio that day.  And under the context, uh, also that it was, it was a, uh, most offensive song contest.  Right.  And they thought it up right on the spot.  But, but it was, uh, you know, it was part of a contest we did.  Most offensive song.  And it wasn't Jay Moore singing it.  No, it was Steven Lynch.  Steven Lynch and Mike Dina Cola. 
[00:15:00]  Jay Moore barely had anything to do with that, but, uh, he's mentioned in the Time article  for being the, for being the, uh, author of that song.  He wrote one line.  All right, so the article moves on.  But O&A are often clever, hammering at the outer band of humor that gets last from discomfort.  Like listening to a gay man perform peach eating on a woman.  For NSYNC tickets, right?  That works.  Okay.  Uh, or playing the silent game where they book bad guests and let them wallow in dead air.  Well, there goes that bit. 
[00:15:30]  They call it cringe radio.  At once punk and frat like Blink-182 or Fred Durst.  Eh.  It's the man's show without all that annoying polish.  The program has a real garage feeling with staff members walking in and out of the studio,  twisting knobs, grabbing papers.  There is no separate producer's booth.  Opie twiddles his own knobs.  He wrote, Opie twiddles his own knobs.  Hey, Anthony, I'm a knob twiddler.  You're twiddling knobs. 
[00:16:00]  What the F, man?  Help me out here.  Opie twiddles his own knobs.  You know what?  I like this article after all.  It's funny.  Uh, but what O and A are most famous for is whip them out Wednesdays when women are encouraged  to flash guys who have wow bumper stickers on their cars or even just the staff of a live  today show as a listener did last summer for a thousand bucks.  That's right, Anthony.  Had a girl do that live on the today show.  Yeah.  And while Stern has to import porn stars, O and A have little trouble finding young women to play along. 
[00:16:30]  I think it gives women some power, Opie explains.  When asked what he means by that, he leans his chair back against the conference room window and says,  that's a good question.  What do I mean by that?  You know, and that's crap.  Because then I answered him and we talked about it for like 10 minutes.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, well.  And nothing I said up in the office is in this article.  Nothing.  And I was rolling. 
[00:17:00]  The only quote we have from Anthony so far in the Time article.  Yeah.  This is something to bring home to mom.  You should be proud of.  All right.  Let me go back to it.  Talking about the Olsen twins book, video, and T-shirt.  That sits under Anthony's poster of the twins.  Anthony's only quote of the Time article so far.  Look how hot they're getting.  And that's an old picture, Anthony says.  On further inspection, he dismisses Mary-Kate as depressed.  Ashley is the goer.  Ashley is the goer.  That's my whole, that's it.  I think that's the only quote in the whole article.  I spent an hour and a half in the conference room talking to this son of a bitch. 
[00:17:30]  And that's what he puts in.  And it's in my pants.  And it's bigger than an elephant.  Sing it.  I swear it was this big.  That's right, Mary-Kate.  That's all.  This son of a bitch.  You know, the more I look at this, the more pissed I'm getting.  That's all.  An hour and a half talking to him. 
[00:18:00]  And then we're just about done.  Even though Anthony does some great impersonations and some middling song parodies,  this is, in the end, a talk show about breasts.  What?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  You can go to other talk stations, says Opie,  but they talk about politics and stuff my dad is interested in.  Who cares?  Oh, is my quote in there?  Wait a minute.  No.  No, you've got to go way back to look how hot they're getting to get to my quote.  Oh, and of course, Ashley's the goer. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks, Joel Stein.  And ONA listeners, unlike those of most call-in shows,  don't call in with questions but stay on the air to trade jokes  or just email them in to be read on air.  Since their home station, NEW, spends little advertising on the show,  the jocks have built their audience by putting on road shows,  inviting listeners to drinks at Hooters,  or handing out bumper stickers from a bus.  Yeah, that's all we do.  That's exactly right there.  We've gone to Hooters like twice, other places, many times.  As working class guys from Long Island,  One have a knack for making their often not-so-bright fans seem interesting 
[00:19:00]  and integral, integral, excuse me.  Some guy shows up with a case of beer,  and a half of an hour later, he's on our show, says Opie.  Sometimes they'll even pretend to listen to people outside the frat.  If a group gets pissed off, are we allowed to say pissed off still?  Yes, because that's angry.  All right.  If a group gets pissed off at something we're doing, say the gay community,  and a guy calls in and he's gay and articulate and doesn't have too gay a voice,  we give him an open forum, says Opie. 
[00:19:30]  Now, what is that?  I don't even remember that being said.  And doesn't have too gay a voice?  And if we did say that, we were obviously joking.  Because gay Marco calls in all the time.  Right.  And that's uber gay.  And doesn't have too gay a voice, we give him an open forum, says Opie.  Says Opie.  Oh, where's my quote there?  Hold on.  Hold on.  I know I got one here, because I talked to this jack-off for like an hour and a half.  Wait, let me go back, back there.  Look how hot they're getting.  And that's an old picture.  Ashley is the goer. 
[00:20:00]  Uh, we give him an open forum, says Opie, slipping into a moment of earnestness.  Then he snaps out of it.  Then we call him a fag and bring on the next stripper.  Oh, God, that's such a joke.  Hey, hey, I sat there.  Man, an hour and a half talking to this guy.  What's the problem, you guys?  You got a quote in here.  Nice quote.  Nice.  Look how hot.  Nice quote.  Look how hot they're getting.  You talk about the Olsen twins.  That's it.  Here you go, Mom. 
[00:20:30]  Here you go, Mom.  I'm in Time Magazine.  I'm talking about how I want to ravage underage girls.  Yeah, that's great.  That's great.  Look, Mom.  Mom, did you see the part where I said, look how hot they're getting?  And I'm talking about 15-year-old girls.  Did you see that part, Mom?  How about when I say Ashley's the goer?  I wish Joel Stein would give us the tape because he'd tape the interview.  Yeah.  And we'll play that on the air.  It'll be much more interesting.  I'll tell you right now.  You know what we've got to do?  And we're stupid for not doing this. 
[00:21:00]  When they pull out that little tape recorder and start taping the interview, we do the same  goddamn thing.  We pull out our huge tape recorder.  We tape it, everything, so when the article comes out, we can go, here's what was actually  said.  What an idea.  Make sure that happens next time.  You know, and before we finish up on this, I do want to go on record and say, I think  it's damn cool that we're in Time Magazine.  I'm not going to start acting like, you know, it sucks.  This is freaking cool.  It's great to be in Time with a quote about underage girls and wanting to have sex with 
[00:21:30]  them of some sort.  Great.  Great.  I really thought you had another quote.  Don't you have another one in here somewhere, like maybe further down?  You know, I told my mom about this, too, that I was going to, you know, me and Opie,  man, we're in Time Magazine.  It's coming out next Monday.  Oh, I'm going to call all my friends.  Oh, my God.  I can see her now.  Hi.  Hi.  You know, Jim, please.  Remember I said Anthony was going to be in Time?  No, I was kidding.  It wasn't.  It wasn't Time.  Please don't get this week's time. 
[00:22:00]  Our friends now are going to be, hey, saw the article.  That's great.  Could you tell me when Anthony's coming by so I can keep my young daughter in the house?  It's obviously what's going to happen.  You know, next time we might as well not even talk to the reporter.  That's great.  I read, Rose, I read the article about your son.  In Time, it was great.  So he's a pedophile. 
[00:22:30]  That's really, that's great.  Anthony, there's got to be something else in here that you said.  But at least it's in Time Magazine.  So, dude, it's not like a lot of people read this or anything.  I'm starting to really, this is sinking in now.  This is in Time Magazine.  The only quotes I have is how hot Mary Kay and Ashley are.  Look how hot they're getting.  Look how hot they're getting.  And then I have to, like, explain it.  And that's an old picture.  Meaning, meaning I've seen plenty of pictures.  And I know that's an old picture. 
[00:23:00]  Oh.  That is your name.  Do you like having your background?  You ever seen a grown man naked?  Well, maybe Rolling Stone Magazine will do a better job.  Oh, my God.  We've got the photographer here taking pictures of us on the air. 
[00:23:30]  There's something different, Time.  What happened?  Behind a glass, pressing our bodies against a glass window.  They're all pink on the inside.  I can't believe this.  I'm in Time Magazine.  The only thing I'm saying is how I'm hot for a teenage girl.  For 15-year-old girls.  But this was a quote from our interview with Time.  They're all pink on the inside.  Your God, they didn't use that one. 
[00:24:00]  Pussah!  I'm sticking in my mouth.  Oh, my God.  If I could have had a couple of more quotes, maybe.  I think we have one of your quotes they could have used.  I'm addicted to boobies.  That's awful.  Great.  And I have another quote they could have used from you.  Yeah?  Virgin.  What happened? 
[00:24:30]  Well, here's a bunch of your quotes coming in now.  Oh, boy.  Buffalo testicles.  I don't remember ever saying that.  Well, you're lucky they didn't put it in writing.  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch, and I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?  I never said that.  Jackasses.  Did you say this?  Hey, man.  Stay here, Paul.  Stay out the bushes.  Dirty, dirty girl. 
[00:25:00]  I never said that.  When I read the article, I thought the Olsen twin thing was kind of funny or whatever.  And I'm like, but there's other stuff from Anthony in here somewhere.  Nothing.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  No.  That's your quote, Ant.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Well, a bunch of people calling in.  They want in on this conversation.  Great.  Give us a call.  877-692-1027.  Brand new number for everyone else.  That is 866-2774. 
[00:25:30]  Wow.  Great.  You're right in.  Look how hot they're getting.  And that's an old picture.  Like, I know I can back it up with facts.  Yeah.  Jesus, man.  Hey, Anthony, is the little Pepsi girl on your short list?  It's Time Magazine.  At least you're a respectable pedo.  Hey, Ant, heard the brownies have plenty of openings for troop leaders. 
[00:26:00]  Ass.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there.  WNEW.  WNEW.  WNEW.  WNEW.  WNEW. 
[00:26:30]  WNEW.  WNEW.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Gee, man.  Give us a call.  If you're listening to us on WNW, 877-692-1027.  For everyone else, 866-2774.  Wow.  What's wrong, eh? 
[00:27:00]  It's going to sink in.  You know, I like you, you know, when we started reading this article.  We're talking about the latest article from Time Magazine, the July 23rd issue with the chimpanzee on the cover.  We're on page 69.  Joel Stein did a fun piece on us, Anthony.  Now, when we started reading this, the first two paragraphs, I was laughing.  Because I thought, you know, it was a great way to start the article off with how we hang out in the office before the show. 
[00:27:30]  But then I'm realizing there's nothing else in here from me.  No, you know.  No quotes, no nothing about the show or anything at all.  I remember talking to him upstairs in the conference room, and I was thinking to myself, wow, Anthony's really, you know, sounding very articulate today.  Well, you know something?  I like doing that when we do the interviews.  No, I'm serious.  I try to distance myself a little from what we do on the air here.  And I try to come across as somebody who's a little informed about things, you know. 
[00:28:00]  I like to think I know a lot or at least a little bit about a lot of stuff.  And I get one quote in the whole Time article, which I wouldn't even care about the number of quotes.  It would be fun if it was something maybe about the show or...  But it's one quote about how hot the Olsen twins are.  In Time magazine.  And it's in Time magazine. 
[00:28:30]  The one I was really psyched at, hey, you know, mom, check this out.  I'm going to be in Time magazine.  You had some great quotes in Brill's content, but no one picked up that article.  It's been on newsstands for months, and no one has seen that article.  Anthony's desk, littered with a Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen book, video, and T-shirt, sits under a poster of the twins.  Look how hot they're getting.  And that's an old picture, Anthony says.  On further inspection, he dismisses Mary-Kate as a priss. 
[00:29:00]  Ashley is the goer.  And that's my contribution right there.  Punch out.  I'm done.  There you are.  That's you for Time magazine.  Everything else?  No.  He goes to Opie for some quotes on things like Howard or the content of the show or other talk shows.  What else?  Guests on the show.  Callers to the show.  What do I get?  Look how hot they're getting.  Steve, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys? 
[00:29:30]  Hey.  Hey, I just want to talk to Knob Twidler and Kid Toucher.  Thank you.  Great.  Just great.  You guys suck big time.  Later.  Thank you.  All right.  Oh, my God.  I'm looking for another quote.  Nothing.  No, that's it.  We've looked a few times now, Ant.  That's it.  You didn't even have to be upstairs in the conference room when we talked to Joel Stein.  Opie thinks Whip Matt Wednesday gives girls power.  That's how Opie explains.  Opie says.  Says Opie. 
[00:30:00]  Opie comments.  Says Opie.  Says Opie.  Just running through it here.  Says Opie.  Opie claims.  Opie said.  Here's another one.  Comments Opie.  Oh, and then you explain.  Opie explains.  Opie exclaims.  Opie says.  And there.  Anthony says.  Look how hot they're getting.  And that's an old picture. 
[00:30:30]  And Ashley's the goer.  Of course.  The whole friggin' Times article.  Anthony.  This guy's a jerk.  Well, at least our listeners are very supportive.  Oh, I'm sure Opie.  Oh, of course they are.  You want me to read a few of these from the Ensign Feedback?  No.  It's your turn in the barrel, my friend.  Dan from Hoboken.  Hey, Ant.  Have you seen Chandra Levy?  Or is he too old for you? 
[00:31:00]  Great.  Don writes.  Hey, Ant.  All you need to complete the pedophile package is get a monkey, one bedazzled white glove,  and a variety of colored surgical masks.  Joe Oneleg.  Hey, Anthony.  Girl Scouts or ladybugs?  Comment.  Exclaims.  Hold on.  Tony.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, I was wondering.  Now, we're doing an article for Nambla Magazine.  I was wondering if Anthony could give us a few quotes. 
[00:31:30]  Look, I never said anything about man-boy love.  Thank God.  Nothing like that was said in jest in the office or something.  Holy smoke.  We've got to cut you off because Joel Stein from Time is calling in.  Oh, he is.  Well, we're in the latest issue of Time Magazine, Anthony.  I enjoyed the article.  I don't think it's an accurate article, but I enjoyed it just the same.  And we've been talking about this article for a good, I don't know, hour and a half.  Uh-huh.  And the guy who wrote the article, Joel Stein, is on the air. 
[00:32:00]  Joel.  Joel.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Joel.  Have you lost your mind, Joel?  A little bit.  Joel, you didn't like us?  No.  You've got to be up front with it.  You just didn't like us, right?  You guys didn't like me.  You didn't like the article?  Well, did you get mad because we kicked you out?  No, no.  There was nothing going on.  At what point did you decide you were, like, annoyed with us or pissed off?  Me especially.  Well, like, where did it hit?  Was it upstairs in the conference room during the hour and a half that we talked and gave 
[00:32:30]  a very, I don't know, articulate description of things that happened on this program?  I found you guys charming.  Charming.  Charming.  Joel.  Joel.  Joel.  Joel?  Yes, sir.  Joel.  Hey.  Joel.  Anthony, how many quotes did you get from me?  Wasn't there a lot, like, upstairs, you were asking questions about, I don't know, how we 
[00:33:00]  got started in radio, how we feel about our audience, how the audience feels about us,  and why they feel that way, and, I mean, just, I could think of dozens of things that  I was quoted on that I believe I gave pretty good answers to.  Yeah, but I only have five paragraphs, and that was a little boring.  Oh, that was boring?  A little bit.  All right.  Then why'd you ask the questions in the first place?  I was hoping you'd say something a little more funny.  I don't think, funny?  Joel, you're asking me questions about the show and the audience and why it appeals to 
[00:33:30]  the demo that we are number one in, and I gave you all those answers, Joel.  No, it was helpful, it was interesting, it was fine.  There was nothing, you used nothing from anything we said upstairs, not one thing, but you include,  now I'm in Time Magazine, finally, I make Time Magazine.  But the last quote was from upstairs.  Here's the only thing that is followed by Anthony says.  Here it is.  Look how hot they're getting, and that's an old picture about Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. 
[00:34:00]  Well, you were commenting on the Olsen twins poster that's hanging in our office.  In the office.  As like a just, he was walking out of our office, and I'm like, you know, because we had talked  about the poster on the air, I'm like, look at that, huh?  The Olsen twins, aren't they getting hot?  And that's it.  That is my entire contribution to the Time Magazine article, Joel.  It was your best quote.  My best quote, nothing else I said was worthy of being in Time Magazine. 
[00:34:30]  You know, I got to admit, when we were upstairs, the three of us, Opie did all the talking.  But you are so full of crap.  Opie, are you backing me on this?  Please, if you could give me the tape, and I could listen back to the tape that you had  rolling upstairs, I would love to play.  We would love to play the tape on the air.  I didn't tape it, remember?  I was just writing it down.  He didn't tape it.  But you are a quiet guy, off the air.  You are so full of crap, I swear to God, I was...  Oh, my God. 
[00:35:00]  Opie is the alpha dog in that relationship between the two of you.  What's an alpha dog?  No, as far as maybe handling a lot of the phone calls we get, as far as, you know, a business  and stuff like that, yeah, Opie takes the lead on that.  Sure.  Joel, I think, honestly, I thought we talked about the same up there.  Really?  No, no, no.  On the air, Anthony comes to life, but, you know, when you guys are sitting there, he's  just kind of quiet.  Oh, my God.  But that's all you got out of him?  Yeah, he didn't say that much. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I'll show you my notebooks.  It's like, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie.  Well, maybe you're just infatuated with Opie.  What can I say?  I don't know, because you know something?  I was answering everything.  I was being, I was right out there.  You were like, yeah, Opie's right.  Opie's right?  You're so full of crap.  You don't suck me, man, because I swear to God, Opie's right.  You are full of crap.  You're serving your energy for the show or something. 
[00:36:00]  Do you know which one's Opie and which one's Anthony?  Did you figure that out?  Yeah, Anthony's the quiet one.  Because I sure as crap hope maybe you tune in to the Fox thing.  I'd be happy to.  Well, I was talking.  You were talking.  I know I was talking upstairs.  Holy God.  I'm sure when the camera's on, I'm sure if I had a tape recorder, you would have come alive.  Hey, Joel, you're not trying to split us up, are you?  No, why?  You can't split you two up, can you?  No, no, no, no, no.  He just happens to be a little more quiet. 
[00:36:30]  Quiet.  I was quiet?  You were charming.  You were nice.  Stop it.  In fact, I'd say you were nicer than Opie, but you were just a little quiet.  Oh, that's true.  Joel, are you doing a bit right now?  No, I swear.  I went through my notes.  I was like, all I got is him calling Ashley a goer.  I must say, we've done a lot of interviews lately, and we both talk a lot.  Get another guy.  Get the Rolling Stone guy on the phone.  I want to talk to him.  I want to talk to him.  I don't know who the brighter one is.  Okay, good.  Do that.  I want to talk, because I think you were on some kind of drugs. 
[00:37:00]  You had to be on some kind of narcotics and not really know maybe who was talking at what  time or something.  Because I swear to God, I was yapping like a frigging idiot.  No, I know which one's which.  Opie is the blonde one with the good skin.  No, I know.  Oh, okay.  Okay, there you go.  He's being a dick.  Oh, my God.  Joel.  What's your problem?  You might not have been paying attention. 
[00:37:30]  Joel.  Joel.  Joel.  Joel.  Yeah, yeah.  It sounds like you don't like us.  No, I had a great time.  Was the article really that uncomplimentary?  You just wanted more Anthony.  Well, now you're like trashing Anthony.  I didn't like, no, he just didn't like me for some reason.  That's fine.  I liked you better.  You're just quieter.  No.  I'm not even agreeing with that.  See, he doesn't like me, because I told him he had to get out of the studio.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But, Joel, I mean, do you like us?  Do you like the show?  Because I thought going into this, you said you were kind of a fan of the show.  I do.  I think I called you guys clever.  I said you did some funny stuff.  Yeah, but you didn't really go into that in the article. 
[00:38:00]  You quickly said...  Well, it was four or five paragraphs long.  That's a page.  One quote.  Look how hot they're getting.  That's it.  No, I said you guys were funny.  Come on.  You didn't expect that kind of treatment for time.  You didn't expect us to say that you were, like, dirty and gross, didn't you?  At least, like, how about when we were talking about the show?  I think what Ant's getting at, Joel, like, the article...  I know what Ant's getting at.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on, hold on.  No, no, the articles start off kind of funny. 
[00:38:30]  You know, you explain the frat atmosphere, and, you know, you talked about the Olsen Twins poster,  which, you know what, we have senses of humor.  We thought, oh, wow, that's kind of funny and a good way to start the article.  Well, but then I think what's getting Anthony is that there's nothing else that he said.  What if you weren't, what if we said that you couldn't have even hung out on the show  or in the office, and all you had was what we said up in the, uh...  I would have used it, but it would have been a less interesting article.  Oh, really?  And it would have been all Opie quotes. 
[00:39:00]  All right.  Well, you know something?  I don't even have a problem with that.  The problem is, the only quote you choose is a little off-comment thing I said in the office for fun.  It was funny.  And then there's nothing else in there.  And you were asking all kinds of questions about everything.  And we answered them, and I thought, gee, silly me.  It was interesting, but, oh, well.  Oh, well.  No, I was hoping you guys would like the article.  It sucks ass, y'all.  It just sucks. 
[00:39:30]  I'm pretty happy that we're in Time Magazine.  I hope he seems to like the article a lot.  No, I'm happy that we're in Time Magazine.  Oh, I love the fact that we're in Time.  All right.  All right.  Well, I'm sorry you guys didn't like it.  Okay.  It was interesting.  All right.  Okay.  The bosses hated it.  Oh, is that right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, because there's, you know, I mean, all kidding aside, there's a lot to the show.  Of course we do the TNA.  Of course we, you know, we get in your face and stuff.  But we do a lot of other things as well.  No, I talked about the silent treatment bit and the guy who, with the woman for the NSYNC tickets. 
[00:40:00]  That was about it.  Hey, Marco.  Come on.  I listed some of your bits.  And then there's words in here I've never heard before.  The Jay Moore thing about the...  Oh, yeah.  Why don't you ask us about the full-blown AIDS song?  We would have talked about that for 15 minutes.  I did.  I said, have you guys ever done anything more offensive than that?  And you said, no, that was probably it.  Yeah, but Jay Moore really had nothing to do with that.  He just happened to be in the studio that day.  Yeah, I hope he's right.  He was singing it.  Thanks, Andrew.  He barely sung that. 
[00:40:30]  It was actually Stephen Lynch and Mike DiNicola that wrote that.  It takes a lot of words to explain to those guys, are they?  Yeah, but then you're not telling the truth.  I'm not telling the whole truth.  I had five paragraphs.  Jay Moore was a part of it.  And you know we're number one all the time, not just often.  Oh, they added all that after I left on Saturday.  What?  On Saturday.  They wanted to add some rating stuff, and they left me messages I didn't get them.  Oh, there you go.  All right.  Sorry about that, though.  All right.  Good.  Well, thanks, Joe.  All right. 
[00:41:00]  Good job.  No, you didn't like it.  Great job.  Can't wait to be in.  Rolling Stone magazine.  When is the Rolling Stone article coming out?  Wait till it's printed before you praise that.  Yeah, count the Anthony quotes on that one.  Look, I don't even care about the counting of quotes, Joe.  You're missing the whole point.  The thing is, there's one quote in there.  I wouldn't care if there was just one quote.  That's the only one.  After an hour and a half of listening to your same effing questions everyone else asks us, 
[00:41:30]  because you don't have a brain in your head to think of an original effing question, you tool,  that we answer everything you say, and you decide it's too boring.  Next time, I'll juggle and answer your stupid frigging questions,  or I'll pull a rabbit out of a hat or something.  Unbelievable.  Ugh, they're all the same.  They're all the same.  Next time, come up with more interesting questions.  I liked Ashley's a goer.  I thought that was a great quote.  Yeah, it's a great, fun little quote.  It's great.  And then that's all there is in here. 
[00:42:00]  But you wanted to say something deep?  No, I wanted to answer your questions.  And I did that.  I thought I did it very well.  Aside from just saying, yeah, what Opie said.  That's right, Anthony.  Yeah.  Do you know each of us try to steer clear from ever doing that?  It's like in our head not to do that because it comes off sounding stupid?  That's right, Anthony.  That's what I did, too.  My God.  We're both individuals that work together. 
[00:42:30]  One is just a quiet one.  Right, right.  The quiet one.  I can't.  This is the first time I've ever thought of Anthony being quiet when it comes to, like,  I don't know.  Maybe he's being confused at who he was interviewing.  Maybe he was talking to two other people.  When we were on Extra, I didn't say a word, and Anthony talked the whole damn time.  Well, you know, when you left for lunch and I was with Anthony alone, he was funny and  he said the stuff about the Olsen twins and on the air he's funny, but when he's in the  room with you alone, he gets kind of intimidated or something.  Yeah, that must be it.  That's exactly it. 
[00:43:00]  You try that game.  Good job.  People have been trying that game for years with us.  Maybe when you're in a room with a writer that actually can write, maybe you get frustrated.  We'll have to say, ugh, ugh.  I'm sorry, guys.  I didn't know you'd be this sensitive.  All right, Joel.  All right, good luck with those.  Thank you.  All right, bye.  Eat me.  Jack off me, douche.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  What a tool.  With a chimp on the cover.  Oh, they were boring. 
[00:43:30]  Well, I'm answering your questions.  The same goddamn questions every other writer asks us.  So he sits there and waits until maybe we're in the office or on the air.  Like I said, what if we didn't even let him in here?  Which, you know something?  He ruined it for every other God effing reporter.  No, no, no, no, no.  Screw him.  No, because the guy from Rolling Stone, he hung for the whole show.  And he was cool.  We'll see if he was cool.  Yeah, we'll see.  We'll see.  You're right.  We will see.  You're right. 
[00:44:00]  You know why?  Because they're two-faced pieces of crap that come off looking like, hey, I'll be a good  guy.  I'm hanging out.  Look, we're hanging.  We're having fun.  I'll come into the office.  Yeah, fine.  And then he turns around.  He's just a smug, elite prick, frigging writing pool jerk off.  The phone's going nuts, but we have to do it, Greg.  Ass.  We'll go to the phones next.  All right.  Okay, Opie.  That's right, Opie.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus. 
[00:44:30]  Don't get mad at me.  I enjoyed the article.  I thought it was cute.  It was cute.  Great.  Great.  Boy, don't lose sleep waiting for that book deal, Joel.  I thought it was informative, Ant.  Informative?  A good representation of what we do.  If I can quote from the article, Opie, look how hot they're getting, and that's an old 
[00:45:00]  picture.  Anthony says.  I thought it was an eye-opener.  If that guy wasn't frigging hot for your ass, I'm on drugs.  Easy.  Opie, no, hold on.  I'm not bashing you.  Easy.  No, shut up.  Don't take this the wrong way.  Easy.  Hold on.  I'm not saying anything about you.  This is nothing reflection of you, period.  All I'm saying is, this guy had a hard-on for you.  We might have to go 60 feet underwater, my friend.  I'm not saying anything about you. 
[00:45:30]  It's not your fault if a gay man wants to have sex with you.  We don't know if Joel Stein's gay.  I wasn't calling Joel gay.  I was saying, if a gay guy came over and was hot for you, it's no reflection on your  masculinity.  Look at my picture.  I'm just saying.  Look at my picture.  There's no hotness there.  It seemed to me he was a little taken with Opie.  What's hot about that picture?  There's nothing hot about it.  You ever go, come on, you go to a bar sometimes, and there's a chick, and you know she digs your  friend, and you're invisible there?  You might as well be just saying, yeah, Opie's right. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, what Opie said.  You know what I mean?  I think the guy was a little hot for you.  You're so far from the truth, because I'm very intimidating in these situations, because  I'm a dick.  Maybe he likes to be dominated by men.  All I'm saying is the guy listening to him talk, it sounded like he had a little soft  spot for you.  Let me tell you something.  This is the guy's honest truth.  He was in here, right, doing the article, and I finally was like, I just don't want him  in here.  And I think you and I discussed it.  I was the bad guy.  I'm the bad guy. 
[00:46:30]  I'm the bad guy.  And I stood up, and I was like three feet from his face.  I'm like, Joel, you get enough?  Because, you know, we want, you know, could you leave?  And I could tell that he was pissed off and not happy about that.  Yeah, because you took his advances and slapped him in the face.  All of a sudden, you're kicking him out.  Sure, that's going to hurt.  It's going to hurt bad.  Joel Stein, kiss it.  He didn't really have a tape recorder, that one?  No.  But he was constantly jotting stuff down.  I think he went through a whole little, like, notebook. 
[00:47:00]  Let me write down, as his golden hair pours down.  Oh, what?  Yes, Anthony, watch.  Watch, stop annoying me.  As Opie swiddled with his knobs, I could only wish I had knobs for him to twiddle.  And Anthony, shut up!  I'm doing an interview.  Twiddling.  Opie twiddling his knobs!  All right.  Opie, he wrote it!  Opie twiddles his own knobs! 
[00:47:30]  How's that for a topper?  Joel Stein.  Okay, you two, Anthony, shut up.  So then, he's twiddling his knobs.  All right.  I'll twiddle your knobs.  All right.  All right.  Listen.  Oh, God.  You really like me.  Opie, Anthony.  Opie, Anthony.  1027.  WNEW. 
[00:48:00]  Hey, man.  Hey, beautiful.  She was a whore.  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it!  Roll around like a dog!  Your balls are yoo-yoo-y.  What?  Can you call an apple? 
[00:48:30]  Hey, who's the stripper?  Ha, ha, ha.  Ah, gotta get right to Jimmy.  Jimmy, what's going on?  Huh?  Hey, where'd he go?  Gone.  He was listening to the Evil Knievel bit and said that it reminded him of the Mickey Rooney  movie.  And I'm wondering if it's the Mickey Rooney movie that we all know and love from this radio  show.  Oh, it's Bill.  It's Bill.  I got good hair and good teeth.  Yeah, that's where old Bill comes from.  One of the best comedies ever made. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  I've told that before.  When that movie came out, it was in the early 80s or something like that.  And I was sitting with my girlfriend at the time.  And we're watching the movie.  Barry, and I start laughing my ass off when old Bill runs into the corner because his  friend Perry, or Barry, yelled at him for taking all the chicken.  They bring out this big platter of chicken because Barry decides to take Bill, the retarded 
[00:49:30]  guy.  He's been in an institution for years.  And Barry decides to take him to his parents' house in Connecticut.  Nice house.  Yeah, because he's doing a documentary.  Right, right.  So the parents come out.  The mother comes out with this big plate of chicken.  And Bill goes, oh, I love chicken.  Oh, boy.  And just starts manhandling with his big, fat, retarded hands.  Just getting all his retard juice all over it. 
[00:50:00]  You know how that is.  You don't want to eat anything if a retard's been touching it.  You don't know where the fingers have been.  They're drooling or picking their nose or their butt or something.  So he's like pawing all the chicken.  And the family's horrified, as would I.  So Barry yells at him, he goes, Bill, that's enough.  And Bill goes, oh, boy, and runs into the corner in the kitchen and, like, takes his hair  off.  And he's holding his wig.  And I couldn't, at that point, I couldn't hold it in any longer. 
[00:50:30]  Because my girlfriend at the time is just crying.  She's crying because she's so sad about this movie and about Bill.  So I just lost it.  I went like, I got a punch in the face.  Boom, you insensitive prick.  Yeah, that's me.  You know what we should do today?  We should make a list of movies that weren't supposed to be comedies, but turned out to  be for whatever reason.  Like, I'll say Bill.  Bill is a good example.  The Other Sister.  Yeah, The Other Sister.  Another one.  One of the greatest comedies ever made. 
[00:51:00]  One of the best retard actors of our time, Giovanni Ribisi.  Oh, my God.  Can that guy play a retard?  Even when he's not playing a retard.  He just looks retarded when he smiles.  Hey, you got to give it to Ed Norton, though.  Ed Norton plays a great retard, but he can play a regular guy.  Yeah, you see that American History X.  He's no retard in that.  No, no, no.  He's a nut.  Yeah, but he turns out to be a pussy by the end of that film.  Well, you're boned.  It kind of changes your perspective on things. 
[00:51:30]  You know, I know we're jumping around like crazy here.  Why not?  Speaking of being boned in prison.  No, no.  Like, I'm taking a sip of coffee.  Hey, speaking of being boned in prison.  Hey, how about that prison boning?  Wow.  Let me tell you.  No, during the Playboy interview, that hot piece of ass was asking us,  is there any time where sex is bad? 
[00:52:00]  What?  Yeah.  And we thought for a few minutes, and then I said, well, yeah,  if you're getting raped in prison, prison, that constitutes bad sex.  Right.  Yeah, she wanted the definition of bad sex.  That's it.  Jimmy.  Hey, guys.  Last night, I'm in bed.  It's like 1 o'clock in the morning.  I'm flicking around on TV.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, I see a commercial for life insurance, and guess who's doing it?  Mickey Rooney.  Oh, no.  And now he just looks like an alien.  I hate him. 
[00:52:30]  You need life insurance.  Call Bill, and he'll get hooked up.  It's wild Bill's life insurance, just like my coffee.  I have good hair and good teeth.  And another point when I started busting out laughing was when he was talking about the  institution he was in for so many years.  Because the story is supposed to be the guy really wasn't that retarded when he was a kid.  Maybe he had one of those kid diseases they get now that you could cure with some lithium  or something, you know?  And they threw him in an institution, and he spent his entire life up until he was like 
[00:53:00]  60 years old or 55, whatever he was, in an institution with retarded people.  So he ended up being retarded by proxy.  So Barry's yelling at him about something, and he goes, please don't send me back to that  place.  And I'm like, wah!  I start cracking up laughing.  Boom!  Punched again.  You son of a bitch!  Do the line where he's trying to remember Barry's phone number?  Oh, this is classic.  Barry was the only friend this guy got, Bill.  The only friend he had that didn't treat him like a complete retard. 
[00:53:30]  I don't know, but she was, um...  No, Helen Hunt was in the remake, I think.  Or in the Bill on his own story.  Okay.  No, she was just some chick.  I thought it was Helen Hunt in the first as well, but...  But Barry was, uh, who was that?  Dennis Quaid was Barry.  So, uh, they got a better job.  Barry got a better job.  So he was going to move far away from Bill.  And, uh, he was checking out the place.  So he gave Bill his phone number so Bill could call him up. 
[00:54:00]  And, uh, Bill's on the phone with the operator.  Number, please.  And Bill's like, I wanted to talk to Barry Moore.  6-9-2-8-3-5-7-2-3-28-5-9.  There's too many numbers, sir.  Barry Moore.  1-8-2-3-7-5-9-8-2-2-3-8-5. 
[00:54:30]  Again, I'm just dying.  We gotta get sound clips from that movie.  Yeah, we used to play them on the show.  I went to rent it.  I cannot find this movie anywhere.  I don't think they put it out on video.  It's a scream.  You gotta see this thing.  Old Bill.  I have regular good hair and good teeth.  He does his dentures.  Barry got him new dentures.  You know, I gotta tell you, I was talking to Jim Brewer.  Yeah.  In the office.  I was the only one in the office.  All you guys were at lunch and doing things.  And, um, I think I wrecked my keyboard because I spit coffee all over it. 
[00:55:00]  One of the funniest things I've ever seen on TV, I don't even know if I'm gonna be able to translate this.  The senior British Open is on, right?  Yeah.  And one of these guys is setting up for a 120-yard shot to the green.  About 120 yards.  And, uh, there are all these people behind, you know, the golfer as he's setting up for the shot.  I hope there's someone that saw this.  And everyone is standing still because the guy's ready to go.  But he's still gotta be quiet. 
[00:55:30]  Except for one person.  A mom and a kid in a wheelchair having a cerebral palsy attack.  Timmy!  Just like Timmy.  Just completely everything was like this.  Oh, let me know, let me know, Timmy.  Completely losing it.  And the announcers just make them believe they're not seeing what everyone else is seeing.  Well, everyone at home is seeing.  What are they supposed to say?  Now as, um, he's ready to tee off, look at that retarded child behind the tee.  Could be quite distracting to the golfer.  Yeah, and he was right behind the golfer, too. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, my gosh.  I just see it out of the peripheral vision you're trying to tee off.  Let me know, let me know, let me know, come on.  Someone shut that kid up.  So I'm on the phone with Brewer and I look up, I see this, I spit coffee everywhere, I'm laughing.  It's like, what's the deal, Dick?  Dick.  I told him, and he laughed pretty hard.  Isn't it horrible when people go to, uh, like, yeah, you get the retarded kid.  Up in Boston.  Oh, there was, uh, one of the waitresses that worked at one of the restaurants I used to go to a lot.  She had this retarded son. 
[00:56:30]  Retarded son.  He was about, I don't know, uh, 15, 16 years old.  And, um, he comes to the restaurant one day and she wants to introduce him to me,  because we're on the radio up there, like he gives a crap.  You know, listen to Radio Disney.  He's retarded.  Mongoloid.  Total.  The face.  Everything.  So, he's sitting down eating, and he, like, he picks up some french fries out of my plate  and starts eating it like he's just eating.  Now the french fries are done. 
[00:57:00]  I can't eat them.  You can't now eat the french fries.  Call me a dick.  Call me insensitive.  But you don't want, because you know where those hands are?  They're always picking at something.  They are.  Don't look at me like that.  They're always picking at something.  The ears, the nose, the eyes.  Yeah, they're always, like, sucking in the snot with the whole back of the hand thing.  And now I'm supposed to be this nice, liberal-minded guy and eat snotty fries?  Retard snotty fries?  I don't want the retard snotty fries. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, man.  It's terrible, but you don't want it.  Dixon, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  The payoff in Bill is the credits when he sings.  Where have you gone, Billy Boy?  Billy Boy, Billy Boy, where have you gone, darling Billy?  All right, you guys suck.  All right.  And Dennis Quaid's playing the harmonica to it.  Oh, no, no.  Bill starts playing the harmonica.  He's spitting all over it.  Where have you gone, Billy Boy, Billy Boy?  Where have you gone, darling Billy? 
[00:58:00]  Patrick, what's going on?  I'm up, guys.  How's it going?  You tell us.  You're in your car.  What's happening?  Well, you got to add part of scum to that with the funny retard movies.  Oh, another movie that wasn't supposed to be funny.  But it turned out to be funny.  I think Forrest Gump, though, you know, they went for some laughs in that, of course.  Probably pissing off a lot of people with your discussion today.  Quite frankly, I don't care.  But I know.  You do have to say the other side.  You used to go to McDonald's there in Huntington.  Oh, yeah.  You got to explain that.  Burger King. 
[00:58:30]  Burger King.  In Huntington.  And I walked in, and there was a Down Syndrome girl working there.  Hot.  Okay, I'm kidding.  She was working there.  And look at how troubled you look at me.  What wig did she have on?  They all have the mohair cut.  Stop.  No, they all look alike with different wigs.  She had the Pete Rose.  Different wigs.  Yeah, she did have the standard Pete Rose.  But she was very efficient.  Because I'm terrible when I go into these fast food places sometimes, and you can't get good service. 
[00:59:00]  People there are mutants.  They don't understand your order.  They get it wrong all the time.  But she was very fast and had the order filled, and it was very accurate.  So there you go.  One for the mongoloids, right?  Right.  See, I'm sensitive.  I have my sensitive side.  Joe, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  Down here in Philly.  Hey, thanks for the support down there.  Hey, that movie, My Left Foot, that was a good one with the guy drooling all over the piano and trying to be all artistic and everything. 
[00:59:30]  He's like, yeah, I'm going to play my piano and drooling on my feet.  Oh, God damn it.  You can't help it.  All right, guys.  Yo, keep it up.  You're kicking ass down here in Philly.  Everyone loves you.  We appreciate it.  Thank you.  All right.  And thank you, YSP.  Yes.  There was another movie that was not supposed to be funny.  What was the one with Sean Cassidy and Linda Pearl? 
[01:00:00]  I don't remember the name of it.  I think it's something like normal people or regular people.  No, not ordinary people.  It was like normal people.  I can't remember the name of it.  But they wanted to get married.  They were retards.  And they fell in love, you know, however much love a retard can fall into.  Well, they love colored balloons.  They need cotton candy.  What the hell's a...  They need loving to it.  Of course they do.  I'm not saying they don't.  And they get it. 
[01:00:30]  And their parents love them.  And they love them back.  But, you know, how deep could a love relationship be between two retarded people?  Quite frankly.  You put a little sparkly glitter thing in front of them, they're happy.  You know?  So you're saying their love is superficial because they can love a hot dog the same way they can love another person.  Right.  They love like a colorful spinning pinwheel just as much as they love each other, I would think.  How deep could that love be?  They're fascinated by, I don't know, a hamster in a cage or something. 
[01:01:00]  Wow.  But that movie was very funny.  They wanted to get married.  The parents, of course, didn't want them to get married because they're retarded.  And they professed their love to each other in just a scream of a scene.  I love that.  And we're going to get married.  Very funny.  Yes, Ben.  Very funny.  I think if you're going to get married, you've got to be able to move out of your parents' house.  Yeah.  That's a good thing.  That's a good start.  Should be a requirement. 
[01:01:30]  Mario.  Yeah.  What's up?  I've got a good one for you.  How about Nell with Jodie Foster?  Yeah, that's a good one.  Remember that?  But she was out in the jungle or something?  Yeah, she was kind of retarded.  Well, she never learned anything, right.  Yeah, she was like, take a drop off.  I'm sorry.  That movie was classic for that, yes.  1027 WNEW.  All right, we've got to get Spaz in here, finally. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  Quite frankly, he's going to bore us here.  Gay boy.  All right, so if you're a faithful listener to the show, Spaz, who we've kept off the radio  for a while now, thank God, he finally completed his gay play run.  How many plays were there?  Five.  Five of this play.  We all remember the first night you said, I don't know, you kind of had a scene where 
[01:02:30]  you had to lay in the bed with this guy and he kind of put his hands through your hair  and as the lights went dim, he made like he was going south to pleasure.  Yes.  That's the scene.  And you were supposed to be straight in this play, but...  I was supposed to be confused with...  Confused with your sexuality.  You had one gay experience before this and now, for some reason, you're in bed with this  gay guy.  Is this the play or his life we're talking about? 
[01:03:00]  Wait a minute.  I'm confused now.  He's supposed to seduce me in the play.  Right.  And you're in his bed.  Yeah.  No, he's in my bed.  He comes into my room.  Oh, how did that come about?  So you have the homo field advantage.  How did that come about?  How did you invite the gay guy back to your room?  I invited him in.  See, the way this scene starts is that I'm in my bed, like sobbing, like I'm fighting  not to cry because of a tragedy in my life.  And he hears that through the partition in the wall. 
[01:03:30]  So he comes in and he...  Takes a temper to the old-fashioned way.  He calms me down and he seduces me.  He uses the excuse that I want to, you know, know why...  Yeah, it's every day that I'm in bed and if someone's knocking at the door, I just let  him in and invite him into my bed.  It's a play, you know?  No coffee or anything?  I don't invite him in because it's just like a little thin wall with like a little slide  door.  He just walks right in.  I don't...  Oh, he just came right in. 
[01:04:00]  He just...  I walk into his room.  What are you at, a bathhouse or something?  Is this supposed to be your apartment?  It's supposed to be...  It was an old house in 1938 in New Orleans.  All right.  And you're just living with gay guys.  No, one is gay.  The other one, if he gets $100, he'll do it.  And you're supposedly this confused guy.  I'm the confused guy.  So now the gay guy's in your bed.  Do you have to talk about this? 
[01:04:30]  Because I know that a lot of listeners were like, happy about spaz-free.  Oh, shut up.  Okay.  So you're in the bed.  I'm in the bed.  And he's sitting on the bed with you.  Yes.  And now he starts, the actor, starts improvising a little bit on the scene.  Yes, just a little bit.  Yeah, let's get this straight because basically you all agree that, okay, you'll do this gay  scene but there's no touching, right?  Well, it's supposed to...  Well, there's only one part where...  There's only two parts where he touches me.  One is when he runs his finger down my arm. 
[01:05:00]  Right.  And the other part is when he puts his arm around my shoulders.  And you agreed to that but no more for this play.  Yes.  But the actor starts improvising.  Yes.  All right, spaz.  What did the actor do to you during the gay play?  Now, the first couple of nights, he started improvising just a little bit.  Just a little bit.  So what was he doing then?  Well, instead of like a finger, he put his whole hand...  And rubbed down your where?  He would rub down my thigh.  So he's rubbing down your thigh. 
[01:05:30]  And then what was he doing?  You said something with...  I don't know.  What was he doing?  Wasn't he breathing?  Oh, yes.  Yes.  He nubbed my ear.  He what?  He put his...  Like he took my earlobe.  Like he held on my earlobe, shook it a little.  What is he, Carol Burnett?  So he grabbed your ear?  He grabbed my earlobe, yes.  So he fingered your ear.  He didn't finger, he just grabbed down the earlobe.  So he had a hold of your...  Your ear.  Your ear.  My ear. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, that's what I said.  That's what I said.  Your ear.  Your ear.  So he gently fingered your ear.  Your ear, I said.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Your ear.  Your ear.  Right.  My ear.  So he had his hand...  Your ear.  He had his hand all over your ear.  All over your ear.  Did he poke anything in your ear?  No.  No?  He just grabbed onto it.  He just grabbed your ear.  Yes.  And kind of flitted around with a finger.  But didn't stick anything in your ear.  Did it sound like my behind?  No, I'm saying your ear.  Your ear. 
[01:06:30]  My ear.  Yeah.  You're from New York.  This is how we talk.  My ear.  Your ear.  My ear.  Your ear.  Yeah.  We said your ear.  He fingered your ear.  He fingered your ear.  Did he finger your ear?  He grabbed onto it.  Right.  Okay.  So, but he shook it with his fingers.  Right?  Yeah.  He kind of played with his fingers on your ear.  Yes.  I'm the ear.  Yeah.  That's what I said.  Your ear.  Yeah.  So, was he blowing into your ear?  Uh, no.  He didn't get that far.  Okay. 
[01:07:00]  All right.  Did he tongue your ear?  No.  I'm just, I'm, I gotta ask.  No.  He did not tongue anything.  Would you consider...  Thank God that...  ...what he did to your ear a diddle?  Did he diddle your ear?  It's like, it's like, like, what...  It's like, uh, like, saying, like, here's looking at you, kid, type thing.  Would you consider it a diddle?  What do you mean like a diddle?  Did he diddle your ear?  What do you mean by that?  I don't know...  I mean, was it a diddle?  You know what a diddle is?  No, it's a diddle.  He just grabbed all of it and, like, looked at me dead in the eye. 
[01:07:30]  Wait, so he used two fingers?  He used two fingers.  He looked at me in the eye and he shook it a little bit.  Two fingers on your ear?  Yeah.  Wow, Spaz.  That's all I could say.  Okay.  So that was the first night of improvising.  Yes.  That he did.  So now, uh, the next night, uh, he gets a little more bold with you.  Well, I don't know if this was intentional or not, but...  Ah.  But, uh, there's this part where, like, where he's supposed to, uh, say, uh, shh, listen to the rain. 
[01:08:00]  And I'm supposed to turn my head away, look out the fake window, and look at the rain.  And when he's doing this, he's supposed to say, I'm going to give you this to help you to sleep.  And he puts his hand underneath the sheets.  And I...  So he's supposed to be manually doing something.  No, no, he's supposed to...  Yeah, he's supposed to be, like, reaching for it.  Right.  But he...  How are you supposed to hear the rain if he's got a finger in your ear? 
[01:08:30]  No, he just numbs it at the end of a...  All right, so you're listening to the rain.  Yeah, I'm listening to the rain, and he's moving his head, and he kind of nipped it.  Now, now, wait a minute.  What?  He nipped your schlong?  Ah!  Fag!  It was unintentional, I'm thinking.  Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!  I never...  Dude.  What do you mean?  No offense, but at that point, you break character.  You break character.  And you punch him in the head.  Yeah.  And you go, come on, man, what are you doing?  I broke character in a different way. 
[01:09:00]  I laughed a little bit.  Oh, you laughed?  Oh, you giggled?  You liked it?  Giggled like a bitch.  Oh, are you giggling like a little schoolgirl?  Giggling like a bitch, man.  No!  No!  No, I laughed...  Finger my ear.  My ear.  I did not laugh.  No.  This is the way it happened.  You see, because I was not expecting it.  Did he touch your unit? 
[01:09:30]  He nipped the tip.  Fag!  Now, I'm not a fag.  He touched the tip.  No, he just brushed, nipped it.  He nipped it.  So you don't even know all the terminology.  Yeah.  No, nothing's teeth.  All right.  And you giggled like a schoolgirl.  I didn't giggle like a schoolgirl.  How did you laugh?  Give us a little laugh.  You broke character.  What did you do?  No, I didn't laugh out loud.  I had this smile on my face. 
[01:10:00]  What?  Wait.  Wait.  Let me tell you something, Spaz.  Play or no play.  Someone's touching my schlong.  Even if they nip into it, that's not the look that's on my face.  The look on my face is...  It's not a big smile.  Right.  But let me just tell you why I had that.  Because I was not expecting it.  Because he has to...  This is the type of person who has a tendency...  When you have...  To play jokes around it.  Oh, yeah.  What a joke.  But the joke's on him, because you're not gay, right?  Yeah, sure.  Why don't you have the look of pure shock on your face? 
[01:10:30]  Boy, that's not my...  That's how I react to everything, though.  That's how I react to everything.  That's like my defense against, you know, like...  My defense against everything.  No, uncertainty or like...  But he nipped it.  He nipped it.  No, laughing is my defense against something if I'm not...  Oh, yeah.  Because I'm so afraid of something.  I can see you on cell block D just giggling your ass off.  While you're a new boy.  Hey!  That's good.  I'm laughing is my defense. 
[01:11:00]  He's tossing my salad.  No, look.  I'm tossing salad.  It would never go that far.  Look at me.  Look, I'm tossing...  It would never go that far.  Oh, sure.  So how far would it go if he nipped it?  He nipped.  I was not expecting it.  And things that I get surprised that I laugh at.  So you laugh.  Yeah.  So now, moving on. 
[01:11:30]  Right.  There was another instance where he is supposed to take his head and move it down towards your intimate area.  Right.  To simulate.  Simulate that he's...  Hobbing the knob.  Pleasuring.  Yes.  Right.  So at one point, he gets so close.  Now, Spaz, you are wearing nothing but flesh-colored boxer shorts.  Yes.  And what was he wearing?  He was wearing the European underwear with the outline.  European underwear with the outline.  What is that? 
[01:12:00]  You don't know.  It's like a...  It's underwear with...  It's like with the outline.  It's a speedo.  No, it's like the shape of your thing, but it goes down to your...  The back's like a thong.  It acts like a speedo, yes.  Oh, my God.  But it's underwear.  So...  Yeah, sure.  So, this guy's obviously gay.  No, he's not.  Police.  He's a respected man.  Well...  Wait.  So now you're...  Look, he's defending his boyfriend.  No, because...  Wait.  So, are you trying to say that gay people aren't respected?  No.  No, I'm saying... 
[01:12:30]  I'm saying this like...  You're one of them.  You shouldn't put them down.  Right.  I'm not one of them.  No, I'm saying this is...  I cannot...  I'm not making any accusations against anybody because he's a good friend of mine.  I asked if he was gay, and you said no because he's a respected man.  Yeah, I meant...  No, I'm not going to make that accusation.  Gay people aren't respected.  I'm not going to make that accusation.  You just did.  Don't...  We have a lot of everything around.  We have a lot of...  It's an assumption.  We have a lot of gay listeners.  They're going to be pissed off at you now.  I already said that I could be friends with a gay person.  Oh, gee.  Well, you pretty much bedded down with one. 
[01:13:00]  I hope you could be friends.  He's not gay, though.  Wow.  Don't do the gay community a favor or anything.  Oh, come on.  I could be friends with one.  Don't do it.  Yeah, sure.  Boy, gee, thanks.  So, Spaz, so now you're wearing your boxer shorts.  Mm-hmm.  And he's wearing his European little...  Yeah, European thing.  ...bathing suit or whatever.  Yeah.  Now, I guess the front of the boxers has a...  You know, the normal hole in it.  Yes.  Yeah.  So, as he does his little move where he moves south...  Yeah.  ...he gets so close, what do you feel? 
[01:13:30]  Breath.  You feel hot, steamy man breath.  Breath on your unit.  But there's a reason for that.  There's a reason for that?  There's a reason for that.  The reason for that is that that particular night...  That particular night, the lights were coming down really slow.  Yeah.  So, he has to stretch these scenes.  So, what he has to do, he has to hold his position there. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, hold his position.  Oh.  So, how does man breath on your penis feel?  Yeah.  How does that feel?  Hot, steamy man breath.  It feels weird.  And what about razor stubble?  What, you think I liked it?  Not once did I get excited.  So, you laughed again, though, right?  That, no, that...  He's not breathing.  No, I shouldn't...  He's not breathing.  He's not breathing.  He's not breathing.  He's not breathing.  He's not breathing.  No.  No.  No, bitch laugh. 
[01:14:30]  I do not laugh like that, all right?  I have a man to laugh.  I need to be told something funny.  This stuff isn't funny?  This is hysterical.  What, are you crazy?  No, but at that particular time, I had a look at confusion on my face because I was looking  in the direction of the lighting person.  Looking erection, what?  Oh, oh, looking at the direction of the...  Oh, direction.  All right, so let me get this straight.  That's French for erection.  You had a look of confusion...  ...because you were looking at the lighting director, and that's why you were confused.  It wasn't because there was man breath on your penis? 
[01:15:00]  No, I was confused at two things.  One is...  No, actually, because the slow lighting led to the man breath.  Hot, steamy man breath.  1-900.  But like I said, it probably was purely unintentional.  Oh, sure.  Yeah, he couldn't just get far enough away.  No, because look, because he had a simulator, so he had to put the blanket up, and he had  his face, like, right there.  Was his head moving?  What?  Was his head moving?  No, not at all.  Did you have your hand on the back of his head? 
[01:15:30]  No, I was...  No, because...  No, because he has to tell me to lean back and imagine the paratroopers, so I have to lean  back.  What?  A paratrooper?  Yeah, the paratrooper is...  The paratrooper was the person I had a relationship with a long time ago before the place started.  Oh, Geronimo!  Yeah.  The pooper trooper?  Pull my cord.  Yeah.  Oh, Spaz, man.  You couldn't find a production of Oklahoma? 
[01:16:00]  Oklahoma.  Oh, yeah.  1027.  WNEW.  It is Opie and Anthony.  Hello.  How are you guys?  Thanks for joining us.  There you go.  Where's that?  Earl took his day off?  Yeah, where's our Earl today?  No, Earl's here.  Why?  He doesn't need...  Earl's working on MLK, but Spaz took off.  Well, we gave Spaz today off.  What kind of irony is that? 
[01:16:30]  How weird is that?  Wait, that is something we've got to talk about really fast.  We gave Spaz today off.  Spaz, probably...  The biggest racist on this show.  The most racially insensitive person.  We gave him MLK Day off.  He's off.  Earl is working.  Well, Earl has more pictures to hang up.  Dude, we've got to tell you, man.  They gave Earl a job last week to hang...  How many pictures, Ben?  We've got a bust on Earl.  I'm sorry.  Five or six, I think.  Yeah, about six pictures.  They're redecorating the WNAW lobby area, and they have a big logo, and then they wanted 
[01:17:00]  like six pictures to hang around the logo.  Yeah.  And there's like, you know, Ant and I with Sammy Hagar, and the radio chick is up there.  The fame pictures.  And a couple of the other shows around here that I don't know the names of.  So they give Earl, right, these six pictures to hang?  Yeah.  How long would you guess it would take to hang six pictures?  Figure out a pattern.  How's it going to look?  We're planning it out.  It would take an hour. 
[01:17:30]  An hour, right?  Including labor.  Let's be fair.  How about two hours, because you just want to take your time and be lazy.  Yeah, all right.  You've got to make it look pro, bet.  Ready for this?  This is the God's honest truth, Ben.  Tell the faithful listeners how long it took Earl to hang six pictures around the N.E.W. logo.  The entire day.  You mean the whole day?  The whole day.  The whole day.  The whole day.  I saw him out there.  He put it.  Dude.  There was a level on top of one of the pictures.  I swear to God.  A what?  A level.  It was on top of one of the pictures.  A level. 
[01:18:00]  It all takes you, like, to the extreme, right?  You could just eyeball some pictures.  Yeah, eyeball a picture.  O.D.  He put in for O.T.  Oh, no.  He put in for O.T. because he went over his hours.  You should beat his ass, man.  Is that him coming down to try to defend himself?  Look at him.  He's all pissed.  Listen to what Earl's going to say.  Come on, Earl.  Hold him.  All right, Earl.  Come on.  Defend yourself. 
[01:18:30]  I have seen the mountain top.  First of all, Earl, why didn't you take today off?  It's MLK day.  Yeah, I didn't take it.  I just wanted to get some extra stuff done in the office.  That's all.  Earl.  Wait, you're off?  He's off.  I'm technically, I'm off.  We never know when you're on or off.  No.  I just wanted to fuss around with some stuff on the computer.  All right, Earl.  How many hours did it take you to hang six pictures?  Be honest.  It took, like, three hours.  No way, man.  No way.  No way.  It took me three.  Earl, Earl, Earl. 
[01:19:00]  No.  Let me finish.  All right, but let me, when I arrive, I usually get here around 1130.  Is that fair?  Yeah.  Were you hanging pictures at?  Yeah, I started about 10.  I finished about noon.  No, no, no, no.  Because after the show, 7 o'clock that night, I walked out there.  You were still fooling around with your pics.  No, we had the pictures up in one configuration.  No, let me finish.  One configuration.  Let me finish.  Let me finish.  We had a pattern done.  We had a pattern.  P. John.  Configuration. 
[01:19:30]  Pre-rounding.  The flap configuration is.  He's getting sad.  We'll be done.  Configuration.  No, we had it in a certain way.  Oh, my God.  Powers that be wanted another way.  So we had to do it over again.  How many pictures did you have to hang?  Eight.  Eight around the logo.  Eight around the logo.  So wouldn't that be two for each side?  I mean, how many patterns could you make out of eight?  No, we had a pattern.  Rubik's pictures over.  Powers that be wanted another pattern.  So we took them there.  Then they were up. 
[01:20:00]  We took them.  Then they wanted captions in the photo.  So we had to take them back down again.  Take them out of the frame.  Make labels for them.  Then when we made the labels, they said, no, the labels don't say in the right order who's in the picture.  I had my opening at the same behavior.  I said, well, it doesn't go left to right.  So we had to redo the labels.  I'm like, we know who they are.  Can I ask you who was telling you all this?  I am not at liberty to say.  A double aunt. 
[01:20:30]  I would love to know.  Then they weren't clean enough.  So we had to take them down again and clean them.  And honestly, it took all day, right?  It took them all day to hang eight pictures that aren't even good pictures.  Did you work alone?  Yes.  No, no, no.  Yes, I did.  Pete and Eddie were helping you out.  No, Eddie was not.  Now you're lying.  Eddie did not help me with the picture.  No, you were not there.  You are lying.  I don't know.  You are flat out lying.  I have hanging pictures.  No, I am pissed off because you are lying.  You are flat out lying. 
[01:21:00]  Pete Johnson told me how because there were these different clips you have to use to put the  pictures up.  It's not like hammering a nail and hanging them up.  Why?  Hammer a nail and hang it up.  It's worked for how many centuries?  There's a new way here at NEW to hang pictures.  I mean.  He's getting mad.  Go ahead.  I'm not getting enough said.  All right.  Try to explain yourself, Earl.  Go ahead.  Because the way the frames are set up, it's not like you could have the, I can't even explain  it.  But in terms of like bounce and they don't fall down every time the door slams, you have 
[01:21:30]  to put in these little hooks.  Yeah, grab one of them pictures there, Ben.  Let's take a look at what these look like.  They have a wire in the back.  But I did it by myself.  Yeah, they have wires in the back.  But I had to do it by myself.  No one helped.  Everyone was walking by and saying, oh, look, Earl's hanging up the picture.  I'm like, Earl, get off the hammer and nail.  Earl, you're not going to get sympathy from our listeners.  They're not asking for it.  There are guys listening that just spent 12 hours on the cold roof and it's eight degrees 
[01:22:00]  out.  No, I'm not asking for it.  You had a whole thing.  I had to hang eight of these.  Here's a fine picture.  How many were out there, Ben?  Was it eight?  I don't know.  There are eight pictures.  An Anthony Bronco bash, Opie, from the last Super Bowl.  You might remember this picture.  Yeah.  A nice border inside the frame.  Well, he didn't have to do any of that.  He really just had to hang them.  Right?  Were they all put together?  Or did you have to put the pictures in the frame?  They had to put the pictures in the frame.  We had to take old pictures out, re-pictures.  So it was six.  It wasn't even eight pictures. 
[01:22:30]  No, I take it back.  There were originally eight pictures.  Two were taken off the wall.  That was the other thing.  Two were on the wall, and then they said, well, these two pictures really don't represent  what we are now.  Take them off.  So we had to take them off.  That must have been the picture of Tom Likas.  Which pictures don't represent what we are anymore?  There was a picture.  No, it was just repeats.  There was one picture of Sammy Hagar.  All right.  And so when you had the eight pictures up and you had to take two down, it must have  wrecked the whole damn pattern for you, huh? 
[01:23:00]  I mean, I just wanted the picture.  I was like, let me just put four on one side and four on the other.  That's all.  That was my idea.  I was just like, let's keep this very simple.  No, they had to be a certain way.  They had to be measured out.  They had to be balanced.  They had to be even.  They had to be this.  They had to be that.  It took all day.  And I was by myself.  Let's just switch them all around.  Yeah, we're going to mess up the order.  We're going to mess up the order.  They had a hard hat and an orange vest, a flag mask set up.  Yeah, yeah.  There were cones set up.  Cones. 
[01:23:30]  Rick's in here with the hammer and nail.  I've got a hammer.  I've got the nail and the little piece that was holding this particular picture.  I pulled it out of the wall.  Yeah.  My wife does these.  Takes her two minutes.  Beautiful pictures.  Now, I'm not disputing that.  What I am saying is.  Should we time him and put this up?  No.  Hey, you'll sign me, kid.  All right, Ant is.  Start the clock.  All right, I'm starting the clock.  Go, Ant.  Ant is hanging a picture.  Ant, go.  Go.  Okay. 
[01:24:00]  So far, Ant, you're up to three seconds.  Five.  Five seconds.  Six.  Seven.  Eight.  Eight.  Nine.  Ten seconds.  Now, the time is that by six.  There we go.  This should take a minute.  It's a hung straight.  Ten seconds.  Ten.  Ten seconds.  See, I'm not, but I'm not, again, I am not disputing that.  I am not disputing it.  What made it such a time-consuming process.  Come on, Earl.  You got a laser. 
[01:24:30]  No, what made it such a time-consuming process was that it took twice as long as it took me.  Twenty seconds.  What made it such an incredibly, like, unbelievably painful process was that the pattern changed  every ten seconds.  Every time we had it one way, it was like, well, no, we got to put it there.  That's why it took all morning.  And forgetting, let us forget, I am by myself.  Earl, I like you too much.  Cut your losses.  Yeah, yeah.  You cannot explain this.  Maverick, punch out, Maverick.  Punch out.  You know what?  Hold on. 
[01:25:00]  Uh-oh.  Here it goes.  Now he's pissed off.  Where's he going?  Look at him.  That is so nicely done.  It's level.  Look at that.  In ten seconds.  And in ten seconds was able to, yeah, perfectly put up a picture.  With the exact hardware that was used.  Oh, my God.  I have a dream today that we can hang pictures in ten seconds.  Where did he go?  Did he walk out or is he coming back to explain?  I think he's going to deal with us later.  No, I think he's coming back to explain further. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, I thought he just stormed out.  Ben, go find out.  I thought he pulled a rock on us.  All right, Ben.  Wow, is that funny?  Yeah, he is coming back.  All right.  Here it comes.  He took all the photos down.  They're all down.  Now, here's my challenge.  All right, he's got a challenge.  Now, here's my challenge to you.  Okay.  Now, I'm going to set the pattern.  All right.  You're going to have to put them in the exact pattern.  It's like Simon says.  In less than what?  Six hours? 
[01:26:00]  No, that's a challenge.  You're going to have to do it by yourself.  First, can we get our own person that we want to do it?  Can we get a chimpanzee in here to do this?  No, the challenge is out to the four people in this room.  All right, to put up six pictures in less than six hours.  But it's got to be the pattern, the way I like it.  Averages an hour per picture to hang on.  Right.  Okay.  Plenty of time.  You got all day, kid.  Goddamn, girl. 
[01:26:30]  He's all pissed off.  I am upset because, you know, it looks great.  I catch crap for it and nobody helps me.  Look, he's really getting mad.  Earl, relax.  It's okay.  Come on, Earl.  I have a dream someday we'll be judged by the content of our character and not the speed  at which we hang pictures.  I want to go get the double arm transplant guy.  And I guarantee he'll do it in less than six hours.  Before the transplant, he'd do it for six hours.  I'm just saying that we had it up in like, I had it up in probably like a half an hour 
[01:27:00]  tops.  Can we please, okay, you know what we want to get at here.  Could you please find me a profoundly retarded individual on the street?  Wait, I mean a drooling mongoloid.  Get that person up here with a hockey helmet on it.  And hang them pictures in less than six hours.  I'm convinced if the right weather conditions happen, they will hang themselves in six hours.  A gust of wind in the right place, maybe an earthquake. 
[01:27:30]  And they can hang themselves.  And it didn't take six hours.  We had it up in like, what, 30 minutes.  And then they kept saying, well, we want it a certain way.  By the time it kept going back and forth, it took all morning.  This is corporate America at its best.  If Earl had a hammer, he'd hammer in the morning.  He'd hammer in the evening.  Because that's how long it took to hang the pictures.  All frigging day.  And put it cold.  Yo, what's his excuse for working today?  He was hanging up the pictures. 
[01:28:00]  No, he had to get some other work done.  He's just in today.  Earl.  What's in the room?  Earl, the ceiling that you're looking up through is glass.  So if you continue to do more that you're doing, you're not going to move up, bro.  You are not going to spend time at home today reflecting on the Reverend Doctor, Professor, HVAC, Technician, Sir Martin Luther King.  Earl came into work today because he's redesigning his office.  He wants his chair just right in front of his computer.  Oh, no. 
[01:28:30]  Pull on these laid out chalk lines.  You know, there's many patterns to try to figure out there.  You got that guy with the tripod on the highway with that measures to do.  What do you call those, man?  Oh, come on, Earl.  It's funny.  Look, he's not.  I have a dream today.  We're very proud of the pictures.  It represents the station very nicely.  They're off the wall, man.  All right.  Now they're off the wall.  It's going to take another six hours.  I'm not touching them. 
[01:29:00]  I refuse to do anything with these photos anymore.  All right, old Dirty, hold on a second.  I ain't going to count that in a minute.  Let's take a break.  Thank you, Earl.  He's all sad, is he?  Come on, Earl.  Earl, it's okay.  These people just don't.  It's all right.  It's okay.  He's really fizzed.  Hey, Ant, let's go put up the pictures.  We got a couple minutes.  Yeah.  Okay, Ant, go put up the pictures.  It should take your work.  During spot.  60 seconds.  Let's see if you could. 
[01:29:30]  I have a challenge for you, Ant.  All right.  He took all the pictures down.  Yeah.  Put them up before we get back from commercials.  All right.  All right.  Let's try.  Ready, set, go.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  Serving New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  This is 1027 WNEW.  New York.  1027.  WNEW.  WNEW. 
[01:30:00]  Earl?  Guys.  All right.  Who's there?  Hey, Rick.  All right.  Yeah.  Rick's down the hall to check out Anthony's work with Earl.  Earl's going to let Anthony know if he did a good job.  I hope so.  All right.  And, Earl, what do you think of your work?  It looks very good.  It looks good?  It looks very good.  It looks good, right?  There you go.  Yeah.  Earl, it took, it took, Anthony, honestly, five and a half minutes. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, but they used, yeah, but they used the pins that I, they already used the original  pins.  It was a piece of cake.  The original pins.  Well, not the original pins.  They used, they used the holes as the markers.  All right.  So, let's say to grab a tape measure, measure off the ceiling and mark off a few spots on  the walls.  Add an extra 10 minutes to it.  That's 15 minutes.  Now what?  Well, you also had to take into consideration, we had it up already. 
[01:31:00]  They made us take it down and redo it.  All right, Earl.  All right.  But, but you're happy with Anthony's work?  All I can say is you had to have been there.  Okay.  I guess everyone can understand in Radio Land why it would take somebody well over six  hours to take six pictures.  It didn't take six hours.  Hour per picture.  Yeah.  No, it didn't take six hours. 
[01:31:30]  All right, Earl.  Well, thank you.  Thank you.  He's pissed off.  He's all pissed, man.  We had to bring it up on the air because everyone's like, oh my God, it's five o'clock  and he's still going.  He's still just hanging the picture.  Wasn't everyone talking about this man around the office?  Everyone was talking about it.  I wish Mark was here because Mark went ballistic on Earl about the whole thing and he doesn't  even work directly with Earl and he just went crazy on him.  You know, it's pretty funny.  I liked, uh, I liked the level. 
[01:32:00]  That was my favorite part of the, uh, the picture hanging thing.  The funny thing was Pete doing it with the level was one of the funniest things I've ever  seen.  Him and Pete first thing in the morning, they got the level, you know, it should go this  way.  It should go that way.  I'll be the first of it.  I didn't know what I was doing.  I've never done this before.  You've never hung a picture before.  No!  I never had to!  There isn't a picture of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King hanging in your apartment?  No, there is not.  Stop it.  No velvet black Jesus?  No velvet black Jesus. 
[01:32:30]  All right.  I'm Al Reed.  Reverend Al.  Big picture of Reverend Al.  So I guess you learned a new trade, uh, Earl.  No.  How to hang pictures.  Picture hanging.  You learned something new.  Scottson ever told you, hang that picture of me and John Lennon up in my office?  Nothing like that?  No.  Next, we're going to teach you how to alphabetize.  Stop it.  It's like you're coming over and you just catch hell every single thing. 
[01:33:00]  Look, he's all bummed out now.  Earl, don't be bummed.  We all know our roles here at WNEW, and sometimes it's pretty ridiculous.  What's wrong?  I'm just surprised you're here.  Yeah, it's MLK Day.  You shouldn't be sad on MLK Day.  We couldn't take off because, quite frankly, we're white.  But, uh...  Dan!  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  You should have taken off.  All right, what's up?  If Earl's not too busy, I'd like to ask a favor.  I'm going to have some breakfast tomorrow.  If you could start making me some toast now, I'd be done with it.  All right, Dan.  He's going to freak out. 
[01:33:30]  Thanks a lot, Earl.  All right.  Later, guys.  It's all...  Earl, do you know how to make toast?  Yes, I do know how to make toast.  Okay, just check it.  All right, Earl.  Oh, look, he's getting all pissed.  Uh-oh.  Earl.  Yes.  He is getting pissed.  Uh-oh.  You're not going to exude any of that, uh...  That rage.  Are you?  Go ahead and say it.  I ain't saying it on Martin Luther King's birthday.  I think Michael...  But we can play the movie trailer from the 70s.  I think Michelangelo is on line 12. 
[01:34:00]  Uh, Michael.  Yes.  Yeah.  I'm calling from the grave and I'm wondering if, uh, Earl has time to help me with the Sistine  Chapel.  I heard, uh, you painted that, uh, quicker than Earl hung six pictures.  On your back.  Against the ceiling.  I painted that on my back and went blind at the same time.  All right, Michael.  Thank you.  That was Michelangelo, everyone.  Earl, do you want me to take a couple more of these calls? 
[01:34:30]  Earl?  Oh, my God.  Why are you pissed?  Now he's pissed.  Like, no one has, you know, had to take it on the show.  Frank.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, I got a new challenge for Earl.  I hear the new boss wants him to hard boil an egg.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God, Earl.  Maybe he can study up tonight at home with his pots and pans.  Oh, get out of the way.  Oh, my God.  All right, you guys.  Take it easy.  All right.  Bye.  All right, Earl. 
[01:35:00]  I won't feel good unless you say you're okay before you leave the studio.  You didn't have to develop the pictures, did you?  I was just checking.  It wasn't like Flintstones time where you had to, like, chisel it out.  Chisel out the pictures before you hung them.  Statue of David.  Oh, Earl.  Come on, man.  Come on, man.  We're just messing around with you.  You know what it's like.  It's your turn in the barrel.  You've never been called gay.  Yeah.  That's a phase a lot worse than hanging pictures for six hours. 
[01:35:30]  Sorry.  I just thought of something funny in my head.  I have nothing to do with picture hanging for six hours.  I'm just...  What?  I'm just pissed, yes.  Come on, Earl.  Leave the studio so we can continue with our show.  Yeah, okay.  Happy Martin Luther King Day.  How are you going to spend it tonight?  Anything?  Any plans?  Don't you have to thumbtack some memos in the Jack Lounge or something?  Are you going to go out on a date or something to a fine African restaurant? 
[01:36:00]  You're giving me the evil eye.  And I can see that very clearly now with my brand new eyes today.  Jesus Christ, Rick.  What did he say?  You are bad.  Ring the bell.  I'm not even going to repeat it.  MLK is on line four for Earl.  MLK.  I have a dream that one day Earl will learn to hang a picture. 
[01:36:30]  Wow.  I'm privileged to have Martin Luther King on the line here.  I had to go up pretty early this morning.  Very good, MLK.  Oh, there's Psycho Mark.  Get him.  Thank you, MLK, for checking in.  Now go bang another white broad.  We've got a show to do.  All right, here comes Psycho Mark that was really outraged about this.  Psycho Mark, you haven't been listening.  We've been talking about Earl's picture hanging.  Oh, that, huh?  A three-day affair.  He swears it did not take him six hours.  That's crap. 
[01:37:00]  It took him two days.  It did not take two days.  Two and a half days.  No, it did not take two and a half days.  Earl, you stood there for four hours with a hammer and did nothing.  No, I didn't.  That is a flat-out lie.  Oh, my God.  You are lying.  He had Pete.  You are lying.  He had Pete.  Lying.  You are lying.  Simmer down, okay?  No, I'm not simmering down.  You are lying.  He's not lying.  You are lying.  He's not lying.  Earl, you took two and a half days.  We did not take two and a half days. 
[01:37:30]  You are lying.  One day.  You are lying.  Two day and a half days.  You are lying.  The chief engineer, this guy is in charge of, like, you know, multi-million dollar equipment  holding up a picture for Earl.  You know how painful this is?  It took Earl longer to hang six pictures than this break is going on.  What a face on Earl.  He's getting pissed, man.  So, Mark, seriously, how long did it take him? 
[01:38:00]  Two days.  Two days.  He's lying.  No, I'm not.  You weren't lying.  Earl, it took, it felt like eternity.  I'll admit, it did take eternity.  We had it up in, like, 30 minutes, and then we had to take it back down.  But then on top of it, there's a big black pubic hair inside one of the pictures.  And I'm like, hmm, I wonder who did these pictures.  It wasn't my pubes.  Oh, it wasn't?  No.  It was a phantom pube.  All right, Earl.  Earl's taking enough. 
[01:38:30]  He's not happy.  Anything to say, Earl?  We'll let you have the final word.  It's only fair.  Go ahead.  Earl.  Earl, everyone.  Oh, my God, he's just, like, shooting me near the looks.  Each one of those eyes had a .50 caliber.  Can't we all just get along?  And today's Earl's Day off.  He looks like the guy from Full Metal Jacket now.  Yeah.  What's his name?  What the hell is his name? 
[01:39:00]  Huh?  Private Pyle.  Private Pyle.  Hi, Joker.  Hi, Joker.  Earl, you got that look in your eye.  You going to be all right?  Maybe.  He's really pissed.  Uh-oh.  Come on.  They did come out nice.  Yeah.  Yeah, that would have really been bad.  We made it that long, and it sucked.  We made it through it during the commercial break.  Took them five and a half minutes.  Only four and a half.  We took them all out, took all the clips out of the wall, and I had to nail them all back  in and hang them in a commercial break. 
[01:39:30]  And I was sitting here with my phones on, waiting for the last spot to end.  Ring the bell.  Come on.  But as Earl pointed out, the holes were in the wall already.  Right.  So I knew approximately where they had to go.  Earl, are we going to solve this, or we're just going to wait for you to leave the studio?  I'm not saying anything.  All right.  Oh, come on, Earl.  All right.  You did put up a nice picture of Van Halen.  Why?  I have no idea.  No, I didn't.  They see you lying again.  You did.  You did.  You put up a picture of Van Halen.  And Tony, there was a pig. 
[01:40:00]  Kermit the Frog.  Kermit the Frog got on the wall.  We had a set of photos.  I went, what do you want on this wall?  And all of those photos got approved.  The Tony pig Kermit the Frog photo got approved?  No.  No.  It had to be taken down.  I think Earl's bummed because his Pam Greer photo got denied.  He wasn't allowed to hang that up there with the rest of us.  Fuck you in living color.  Come on, Earl.  That's right.  There was a Van Halen photo.  There was a Van Halen.  Nothing to do with what the station is now, but it looked good.  Listen, we've got to move on. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, my God.  It wasn't like I approved the photos.  I went, what photos do you want on the wall?  That's what I asked.  It took all freaking day for five pictures.  Six.  Five pictures.  It took.  Sex.  Sex.  Okay, sex.  We're talking.  This is rocket science.  Fine.  Then you do it the next time.  I won't do anything.  30 seconds.  I am not going to do it.  No, I'm just, I'm upset because I asked for help.  Got none.  Why do you need to know a picture? 
[01:41:00]  You and Pete and Eddie.  You and Pete and Eddie helping you.  Eddie did not help me.  And on top of it, Earl, there were thumbprints all over the pictures.  It looked like someone smudged their face up against each one.  You didn't even bother cleaning them.  I did clean them.  There was a big black pubic hair in one of them.  A big, giant black pubic hair.  Now, when someone comes down the stairs, we have nice people come to visit.  They see a big, giant black pubic hair in one of Bopey and Anthony's pictures.  That's a bum stop.  Fine.  All right, Earl.  Next time.  Wow.  Next time we'll get, we'll get you a whole staff. 
[01:41:30]  No, just leave me out of it next time.  I need overtime.  It has to be a union job.  Everybody knows everything, so leave me out of it next time.  All right.  Oh, God.  Oh, here it is.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Just admit, it took all day.  What was it that it did take all day?  If you were any help.  What was I going to do?  Oh, that looks good.  A little bit to the left.  No, you know, I have, like, more employees to do.  Some of us have work to do. 
[01:42:00]  And I didn't?  Earl.  Obviously, no.  All kidding aside, why did you need someone to help you?  I'm not saying nothing.  I will say nothing.  He had Pete, the engineer, who had to put in, like, a bunch of compressors that day.  Like, real important stuff for the radio station.  There's Pete holding the pictures up for Earl.  This guy's a union guy.  He's holding pictures up for Earl.  I'm like, this is ridiculous.  Now I know why you wear all black.  It would take too long to try to figure out what to wear. 
[01:42:30]  Come on.  That's funny.  Come on.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  That's funny.  Oh, the humanity on this MLK day.  Come on, Earl.  That's just a good joke.  Are there any assault rifles nearby?  Should we spend the doctor, reverend, reverend doctor, which way did I go?  Martin Luther King's birthday, a room full of white guys just ragging on a black man.  Is that the way we should celebrate the birthday of the reverend doctor, G-Y-N-O-B-Y-G-Y-N, Martin Luther King? 
[01:43:00]  Who's your doctor?  I never saw it with a stethoscope on.  Is that how we should?  Oh, come on now.  Oh, I'm out-raised.  I better come up with Reverend Allen.  It's a really team raiser.  Earl was just doing his job.  Hang in picture.  What's the problem that took six hours? 
[01:43:30]  Sometimes it takes me that long at Kentucky Fry's to go through six buckets of chicken.  Reverend Allen loves Kentucky Fry's.  Sometimes I wake up in the morning and I understand Earl's hardship because it takes me that long to see if my big Volkswagen hubcap medallion is level.  The same way, because my body's as big as a wall, so it's like hanging a picture.  A little to the left.  No, a little to the right.  A little closer to the right nipple. 
[01:44:00]  I'm living as big man booze.  But I'm outraged that a room full of white men are ragging our black brother Earl, even though he's just black on the outside.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  All right.  You guys got to stop ragging on our own.  Okay.  Trying to do his best.  Right.  And he just wanted all the pictures to be level, making nice presentation for all your patrons coming into the place. 
[01:44:30]  Just like all those quirky Steinbrenners in the store.  You know, when they're packaging your groceries, they're taking all their sweet time.  You've got to have a little sympathy for them.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, Dave.  All right.  Our line, too, is Nigga Charlie.  Thank you, Dave.  Nigga Charlie checking in.  Charlie, what's up?  This here is Nigga Charlie. 
[01:45:00]  My brother Earl be making Nigga Charlie look bad.  I'm taking all this long to hang up some pictures.  I don't clean up the West anymore.  Clean up the West.  Nicking hanging pictures up.  Nigga Charlie can't handle this.  All right, Charlie.  I don't like this.  All right.  Thank you, Chuck.  Nigga Charlie got to go.  Bye.  Hey, where's Garrett Morris? 
[01:45:30]  Hey, where is he?  Garrett.  Garrett Morris.  What's up?  What's up, Garrett?  How are you?  Make yourself at home.  We're just having a little party here.  Swept away.  Oh, my old little girl.  Isn't that a sad story?  Three girls swept away here in New York in a riptide.  Horrible.  Tell you a little story.  Wrote a song about it.  Here it goes.  Oh.  Yeah, I can do a song. 
[01:46:00]  I can do a song about it.  Yeah.  Stealing from me in living color.  It's a shame about these three girls.  May God bless them.  Yeah.  You know.  But I'm keeping my breasts.  Okay, y'all?  Oh, you don't want to get the...  Those guys out there talking about you guys going to do...  Yeah, we got the man boobs contest.  I'm too young to have my boobs cut.  No?  I'm too young to have them cut.  Well, you look like you keep yourself in shape, so I don't think you need that.  My wife goes crazy over these every night. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, yeah?  She loves my body.  She's crazy.  I mean, really.  She's an animal.  That's what you need.  I take off my shirt.  Can't get rid of them, man.  And she's like...  She just made her 60th birthday.  I hope she isn't listening, you know.  Oh, wow.  Well, those guys have man boobs, Garrett.  Yeah.  So they need some of the fat sucked out.  They are men.  And what other boobs could they have?  Well, you want to see them?  See how bad they have women boobs?  They're men, right?  Right.  So why is he telling me, since I saw there were men, that they got man boobs? 
[01:47:00]  Did I think they had bear boobs or something like that?  No, but, you know, they call them man boobs.  Or chicken boobs.  If you just say boobs, you default to woman.  You know what I mean?  So if you say man boobs, you know it's a guy with boobs.  Well, since we talk about man and woman boobs, could we bring a woman in here to show us her boobs?  I don't remember what they look like.  We have a girl, Sandy.  Yeah, because I don't remember what they look like.  Sure.  Why don't we bring in?  Do you remember what women, I don't, you know, I saw a, well, my memory revived.  Gary, Gary Hall, right?  Sandy Kane.  Yeah.  Benaka, benaka.  This is me.  This is the quality of you, Garrett. 
[01:47:30]  It's going to make you wish you were back at the ATM.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, Jay.  Oh.  I'm a guest, man.  I'm a guest.  Hi, baby.  Oh, my God.  Hello.  Hello, beautiful.  That's what everyone says.  Oh, my God.  Hello, beautiful.  Oh, my God.  No, Garrett, don't kiss me.  Garrett's always a gentleman.  He always kisses a lady's hand.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's not the Ixnay on auto-tway.  Go get the Lysol.  Go get the chemical.  Why?  Get the DDT.  Don't you, but just remember what I told you last night, okay? 
[01:48:00]  Just remember what I told you last night, okay?  Yeah.  Garrett.  Now, Garrett, on a short notice, the same hand that Sandy Kane used to make sure the hemorrhoid  was visible.  Let's just put it that way.  Now, Garrett, we apologize.  Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, see, words like hemorrhoids.  You know, I think those are like, you know.  What, hemorrhoid?  Yeah, that's below the belt.  Well, she's got them.  But she's got them.  Garrett, you want to see below the belt?  I don't want to see.  Tell me what you got, Sandy.  I don't want to hear about no hemorrhoids. 
[01:48:30]  Huh?  Sandy.  Oh, she's in on it, too?  Sandy, Sandy.  But I'm saying, show them twatto.  No, I don't want to.  It's that bad.  Twatto.  You don't want to see twatto, Garrett?  It's all on one.  Lurch, Lurch, Lurch, Lurch, are you in the car?  Please drive here, please.  Uh-oh.  Okay.  Hey, wait, no, just show Garrett really fast.  But back up.  But back way up.  I already saw it.  Oh, you didn't?  No, you didn't see this.  I saw it.  I saw the hemorrhoid. 
[01:49:00]  No, this is something a little different, my friend.  Sandy Kane, back way up to the CD rack.  All right.  There you go.  Just give Garrett some room there.  All right.  Okay.  She looks great.  All right.  It looks great.  All right.  Sandy, hurry up.  Let's go.  If she kept walking backwards.  Okay, you look good, too.  There you go.  A little compliment.  I'm not going to have no hemorrhoid.  No, it's not a hemorrhoid.  It's twatto.  It's twatto.  Check this out.  Twatto is an amazing conjoined twin she has growing out of her lap.  Yeah.  Watch this.  Check that out.  Ready?  Yeah.  There you go.  Oh!  What the hell is that, Garrett? 
[01:49:30]  What is that?  We're selling advertising space on it.  Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, we have an alien that has been living here.  Yeah.  I have discovered the alien.  You ever see Total Recall?  You can cover it up now.  Right?  Okay.  I'll remember this for the rest of my life.  Okay?  No way.  You have to show me.  I got it in here.  Okay?  Yeah.  Because that's something that doesn't leave you very quickly.  So you were serious when you were talking.  Oh, yes.  You got like a thing going on.  The other thing is in the back.  No, there's one just like it. 
[01:50:00]  I don't want to say that.  No, no, no, no.  There's one just like it at the back door.  I don't care.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  I don't want to say it.  All right.  Send me a picture.  Okay?  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen, I thought I was going to come in here and talk about a movie called Jackpot.  Jackpot.  Oh, no.  I don't know.  There's the plug.  I was wondering.  I don't know.  I was going to tell you to talk about hemorrhoidal situations and preparation-age situations and  bad situations and little things falling out just situations. 
[01:50:30]  I didn't know.  I thought I was going to come in here.  Jackpot.  Right.  Hello.  You know, Jackpot, which is not talking about Las Vegas.  Yeah.  What's Jackpot all about, Gary Moore?  Jack, Jackpot.  That's funny.  You should ask.  I was wondering.  It is a movie.  Okay.  Now, what's your name again?  Sandy Kane.  It doesn't have Sandy in it, although I think we would rethink that had we seen her before.  Because it is a weird kind of a movie.  And I think Sandy sort of belongs in a movie we call weird. 
[01:51:00]  Would you say?  Do you have the part of the cover available?  Well, but Jackpot is about the movie that I just made with this guy, Jonathan Grice.  Uh-huh.  But he used to be my engineer.  And Martin, I did a thing called Martin a long time ago.  You probably remember that.  Martin.  It's a black show.  You guys probably don't look at it.  I love watching Martin.  On WB.  You probably look at ABC, NBC, CBS.  Martin.  Oh, what's up?  Okay.  Of course.  What's up?  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah, you dig it.  And then a guy came five years later and claims he created what's up, what's up, what's up, 
[01:51:30]  what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up,  what's up, what's up, what's up.  So I said, what's that?  He said, well, they just developed.  I said, what happened to Martin?  Oh, like the Budweiser guys, you mean?  Yeah, he said, what's up?  What's up?  He didn't discover that.  Are you saying Martin invented what's up?  Hello?  What's up?  Yeah.  Mr. Morris is saying that.  No one said what's up before Martin.  It wasn't in the English language.  Everyone's ripping off Martin.  It wasn't in the English language.  It wasn't in English.  But jackpot, jackpot, jackpot. 
[01:52:00]  Get that back to jackpot.  Ladies and gentlemen, come Friday.  No one said what's up before me.  Jackpot is going to jump out of the pot.  Jackpot.  Yes, we're going to have a premiere.  You're right, Mr. Morris.  That commercial stole from Martin.  And, and, and, and.  And your favorite, Daryl Hannah, is going to be in it.  I don't like Daryl Hannah.  Okay, your favorite.  Oh, yeah.  Your favorite, Peg Lipton.  No, I'm cheating.  Peg Lipton.  Hello, you all right?  She's all right with you?  From the Mod Squad.  She was banging Quincy Jones.  Yeah, she certainly was. 
[01:52:30]  Well, I'm not in the woman's sex life.  I'm just talking about in the movie.  Yeah.  Who else is in it, Mr. Morris?  Oh, well, yours truly, Jonathan, Daryl Hannah, Crystal Bernard.  Now, Crystal is all right, right?  I mean, Crystal is a...  I wonder if Quincy Jones' glasses got all messed up when he was banging Peggy Lipton like they were in the We of the World video.  You see, ladies and gentlemen, this is called trying to fight against odds that are not, not just, just, just, you know, un-un-un-conquerable. 
[01:53:00]  I understand, but just, just, trying to just get up out of a pile of s**t.  I'm sorry.  You know what I mean?  Get your head up.  Did you believe that?  You're going to believe that?  Yeah, we can get that.  Get your head up out of this pile of animal manure.  All right?  I understand.  Of animal manure.  Right.  All right?  And get your head up just to say, jackpot.  Jackpot.  Jackpot, yes.  It premieres Friday.  It premieres Friday, yes. 
[01:53:30]  So, anyway, anyway, anyway, come in, come in, come in, come in, lady, come in, lady.  Not, not, not, now, you see, he shows, he shows, he shows that he ain't right.  Why didn't he say, um, I don't know, Joe, Joe.  Mr. Morris, I don't know.  Yeah, he said Bill Cobb, he's black.  See, he's better off rolling Magic Johnson through barbed wire and then hugging him.  Another black guy, so, you know what I mean?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, you've got to explain what's going on.  That's a great line.  Wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on. 
[01:54:00]  Go ahead.  I can't even hear what's going on.  All right.  Well, Garrett Morris is, uh, hugging Sandy Kane.  Yeah.  And Jim said...  Amazing, great, our sweet dust, I'll pray for them, Lord, pray for them, that they are red like them.  Say, pray for them, pray for them, that they want, were robbed. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, she's gone.  But now they've been found and they were lost.  But now they're at sea.  No, no.  Thank you, Lord.  Play a song like Decaptown Lady.  Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.  What the hell was that?  I think Chico took one too many balls to the head.  I'm a Miss Plebeians, ladies and gentlemen. 
[01:55:00]  I'm a Miss Plebeians.  I pay you boys to build a railroad.  I'm a Miss Philistines.  I'm a Miss Philistines.  I'm a Miss Philistines.  Ladies and gentlemen, I want you to know.  I have not sinned.  No.  I have not sinned.  Tell her, brother.  Okay?  I came here in good faith, Lord have mercy.  Garrett, I got to ask you something.  And my good name has been drug through the mud.  I'm sorry, Jim Norton.  You know?  And you have drug my name through the mud.  Hey, if we can't have Dice on the show, what the hell? 
[01:55:30]  Garrett Morris will do.  Andrew Dice Clay?  Yes.  Oh, that's my mantra.  Andrew Dice Clay.  Andrew Dice Clay.  How you doing?  Go ahead, man.  Hey, how you doing?  Talk, bro.  Talk, bro.  Hey, this is the man's show.  How come I get banned from the show?  This is the man's show.  This is the man's show.  Go talk, bro.  Talk, bro.  How come I get banned from Saturday Night Live?  I don't know.  I've been banned my damn self, so what the f*** about you, man?  You ever seen me on in the last 20 years or so?  Hey, Garrett, what is that like when you get shot? 
[01:56:00]  That's got to hurt, right?  In other words, nothing is sick.  No, no.  I got to know.  I told you to ask that question, Mr. Morris.  Don't ask it.  What happened in that situation?  Because you heard about it, but I never heard any details afterwards.  Well, know why you never heard the details?  Why?  Because I don't f***ing want to tell you the details.  Oh, okay.  All right.  All right.  You don't ever want to tell me the details.  No, no.  I have spinal cord injury, bro. 
[01:56:30]  The thing went through my spine.  I'm supposed to be a quadriplegic.  And you're walking.  Now, watch this.  Now, laugh.  I ain't laughing.  Yeah, you are.  Yeah, you are.  Why would I laugh at something like that?  You want to laugh at something like that?  Because you're a student of sick comedy, and you guys laugh at anything.  And there's nothing else sacred.  That's right.  There you go.  You got the whole thing singing.  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  I'll say Jesus Christ.  See, I think we got off on the bed on a wrong place. 
[01:57:00]  Mother, mother, mother, mother, mother, mother.  What's the name of the lady who just died?  Mother Teresa.  Mother Teresa.  Yeah.  Yeah, she just died.  He laughed.  That was funny.  Okay.  That's Jim Waird.  Okay.  The guy's got no conscience.  Martha Washington.  See, that's not funny.  You're a legend in the comedy.  No, I'm, I'm, I'm.  No, you are.  No, no, no, no.  And you were injured, so he wanted to ask it.  No, you're setting me up for nothing, okay?  I'm the least one in this line, okay? 
[01:57:30]  I ain't no legend in my own mind.  I ain't nothing but just a common art American black boy trying to make a living in this man's  world.  You know what I mean?  Garrett, seriously.  And y'all just picking on black people.  That's all you do.  No, Garrett.  It's so easy.  I'm freaking tired of this, you know what I mean?  Go ahead, man.  What?  What?  What?  I was a point in my life.  Jazz, Jazz.  I was talking to you outside.  I told you you were in my prayers.  Like, that really was, like, big news and shook a lot of people up.  And I really, honestly, I know these guys real well.  You told me I was your parent. 
[01:58:00]  What?  You said I was your what?  I said you were in my prayers when I found out you got shot.  Hey, man.  So I'm telling you.  You sure did.  You sure did.  He praised the same thing.  I'm telling you, I know these two guys well enough that if he's asking you about what  happened, it's because he's concerned also.  I really wanted to know because I never got any knowledge on it.  I just told him.  And if you don't want to talk about it, that's fine.  Were they, like, gangbangers?  Was it, like, just a random thing?  Did I know the guy who said, Shelby?  Hell no.  Tim, shut up and stop pretending you're a kiss-ass.  These guys, this was a guy in a girl.  You were like Norris sitting here. 
[01:58:30]  This was a guy in a girl.  Oh, here it comes.  Phone call.  Phone call pending.  No, I didn't know these two.  I've been going around South Central for, like, 12, 13 years before that happened.  That's where you're from?  No, no.  I'm from New Orleans, Louisiana.  But I happen to be living in L.A.  But why does a man with a lot of money, like, live in South Central Los Angeles?  That's a good question, Jay.  Did you go to USC or something?  I don't understand the question.  I can live with a lot of people.  I won't.  Let's do this back to you.  Wow.  And my money need not be something you ask about the relationship to that.  Okay? 
[01:59:00]  That's your problem, not mine.  That's your problem, not mine, bro.  I don't have any problems.  It's not a question I would ask is what I'm saying.  You know, but I don't live in South Central.  Well, I live in Burbank.  Okay.  But I would live in South Central if I wanted to.  It had no problem to do with...  Hey, man, I'm on your side.  I'm just saying...  And I'm not on your side.  I'm on your side.  I'm answering you correctly, bro.  Thank you, sir.  And that is that where I live has to do with only how I feel inside and not the amount of money I have.  I'm not questioning...  I know you're not.  You're being sensitive.  I'm simply answering all the ramifications of your questions. 
[01:59:30]  You are being very pure.  I applaud you.  Hey, everything's cool.  I'm not putting you down.  But I still repeat, I'll live wherever the f*** I want.  Okay?  And it has no relationship to my money or whatever money I might have.  You're going to be bleeping out all of this, right?  No.  It has no relationship to the money.  And the reason why I answered that is because your boy was living there.  Ice Cube.  Why are you so sensitive about it, though, Garrett?  Ice Cube.  Why are you so sensitive?  Who's sensitive?  Because I said I live wherever the f*** I want?  No, not that one. 
[02:00:00]  You're saying that's sensitive.  That's just gas.  No, that was him.  No, I didn't say nothing.  I'm blaming you.  No, that's him.  All you white guys sound alike to me.  Okay?  We all sound alike.  Garrett, I think the prevailing question, to be more blunt with my point is, I act like  you, and I'm not really going to go to an ATM in South Central because it's probably not  the safest place to go to an ATM.  That's not right.  That's not you thinking wrong.  Everywhere you go, you get shot, excuse me, any f***ing way you go in Los Angeles, you  get shot. 
[02:00:30]  Okay?  Okay?  So, to say, look, there's a high crime rate in Hollywood, right now, Hollywood.  It doesn't match South Central, but it's high.  All right?  In Van Nuys, there's a high crime rate.  Absolutely.  All right?  You know why?  Mexicans.  I said, I don't want to speak against my people, my friends. 
[02:01:00]  You're strong, man.  You're strong, man.  You're strong.  You're strong.  Man, is this a setup?  No.  No, it ain't a setup.  Look, I want to thank you guys.  I'm serious, okay?  I really want to thank you guys for having me here, okay?  No problem, man.  All right.  All right.  No, hey, you know, not everybody's doing it.  Conan said no.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  That son of a b***h, huh?  What are you working on?  I guess he knows how to do it.  Well, fancy you should ask.  Besides Jackpot, I got a sitcom I'm working on that's called Bourbon Street. 
[02:01:30]  It's a jazz sitcom.  I'm from New Orleans.  Then I'm trying to hook up something that's out of my New Orleans.  Let's all sing one of the songs I think can bring everyone together that Garrett made famous back on SNL.  I'm going to get me a shotgun and kill all the whities I see.  I'm going to get me a shotgun and kill all the whities I see.  I see women sing. 
[02:02:00]  I win with that rule.  Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, I want you to know I love white people, okay?  They're all right with me.  Of course.  Okay?

He looks a little bit more festive today.  You are gay.  I went over and I asked Ben.  I said, yo, Ben, does Rick have highlights in his hair or something?  And then to confirm, I have Anthony's. 
[02:07:00]  You know, I mean, look, all right.  It's a cowlick with blood highlights.  It looks like I'm a rat.  It's in the hole.  You're my man, though, Rick.  You know?  You're my man, Rick.  Oh, you're very naughty.  Be quiet, sir.  Pussy!  Oh, brother. 
[02:07:30]  Old Dirty, we've all been tiptoeing around the back office.  I can't believe you brought that up on the air.  Oh, what?  Oh, so...  His wife doesn't even like it.  Tell the story on the air, man.  Come on.  Rick, man, you're on Christopher Street, son.  Come on, man.  We'll take you to Privilege, man.  I swear.  No, we're going to take Rick to Privilege.  You're getting off at Christopher Street, ain't you? 
[02:08:00]  Old Dirty, you're acting surprised.  Like, you don't see that look in the hood.  What?  It's usually the ladies, though, right?  No, no, man.  The ladies get the highlights.  The Puerto Rican ladies with the blonde hair, right?  Yeah, they look good, man.  But come on, Rick, baby.  What's up, man?  You got something down low you want to talk to Old D about?  Come on, you can tell me, son.  Come on.  Nothing I want to talk to you about, Old D.  Come on, man.  What's wrong with you, B?  Look, at least I have hair.  I know, man, but baby, come on, bald.  It's beautiful, man.  You know what I'm saying?  Just tell him, my man.  Come on. 
[02:08:30]  Come on, Rick.  It's hard to get licked, man.  Come on, Rick, you're among your friends, bro.  What?  Come on.  Tell the story of what your wife said when she saw your hair.  You didn't ask her?  Dumb are you?  Yeah, let's just show up with a little fruit swar on top.  She didn't know that you were going to do this?  She knew I was getting a haircut.  That was about it.  So what happened when you were getting your haircut, you said, hey, throw in some blonde. 
[02:09:00]  You said, hey, throw in some blonde highlights, right?  Yeah, like I had done a few months ago and it started to fade.  Hey, hey, I want some highlights.  Yeah, and Dominic went a little crazy on me.  Oh, and then he did your hair?  Hey.  You dick, Dominic.  All right.  Okay.  Hey, did you? 
[02:09:30]  So then what happened when Linda saw it?  Well, I was coming up the stairs at home and I forgot about it because, you know, it was all day.  and I'm walking up the stairs thinking about TV  and what I'm going to watch  and I get up there  and she opens the door and she's looking at me smiling  and then she sees me in the light  that's when the smile left her face  what did she say?  she says who's the gay guy  and what did you do with my husband?  hey, hey, hey 
[02:10:00]  yeah I want a big fat Jap to sit on my face  whoa, a Jay Moore clip coming in  so needless to say  she wasn't very happy  what is that?  okay, Joe checking in  hey Rick, it's alright to cry  Rick, looks like you're going to cry too, right?  let's make Rick cry, bro  let's make Rick cry  I ain't going to cry  yo Rick, you mad at me, bro?

I don't know  what made you do it, Dominic?  he was giving you a back rub  and you got all freaky on him, right?  he said you could do whatever you want, baby 
[02:11:00]  right?  no  alright, well  a little something for the sun  are you happy with it, Rick?  I think he went a little overboard  a little more than I was expecting  maybe something more like  that you wouldn't quite notice  but go, maybe the sun is like bleaching Rick's hair  it was something you would have liked more than  a little bit like the way I had it last time  right, right  mhm  Rick's mad  okay  well, I'm not  I'm not saying anything  he's offering 
[02:11:30]  offering to buy me just for men, but  ha ha ha  he's sick  hey  ha ha  that's a crying game  that's crying  that's bad  oh man  yeah, baby  do I make you horny?  yo  no matter what you do, bro  I still like you  you're alright  whatever you do on your own time

[02:15:30]  digitally manipulate  there were two fingers involved  right  you could say that, right?  and some, uh, oil  and some oil  he'd use a little oil  like they do  when they're lubing up  your thighs maybe  and, uh, massaging you  he wouldn't stop there  no  no  and this is a high  a high-end place  we've sent  we have sent people  we know and love  to this place  well, um  hundreds of guys  for Mother's Day  and Valentine's Day  oh, you did, Rick  sent, uh  sent their ladies  certificates to this place

[02:16:30]  yeah  because there's  one massage guy  uh, Mr. Jew  Mr. Jew  he's an Asian guy  and his name is  Mr. Jew  I swear to God  what's his first name?  Yang Chang  Mr. Kang  Kang Chang  something  Jew  Jew, right  so you want to play  the little tape?  yeah, let's see  what the news did  with this story  see, I sent Sandy there  she's gone back  many times  uh-oh 
[02:17:00]  now I think  I understand  I sent my mom there  that's why we need  to get your mom  on the phone  she went there  for a whole nice day  of pampering  and your mom  who knows  if she was  digitally manipulated  she might have been  digitally manipulated  by the Jew  by a Jew  Mr. Jew  Mr. Jew  I hope she calls  yeah  alright  well here's the story  we'll stop it  as we go here  alright now  to the sexual secrets  behind the closed doors  of a spa  a woman believes 
[02:17:30]  she is the victim  of sex abuse  in one of them  and others  are stepping forward  Lenny Schmidt  has the story  she's in Westbury  Long Island  right now  Linda  that's right  there  John and Rosanna  well what started out  as a day of relaxation  quickly turned into  a day of horror  for at least one woman  from Long Island  now she has told her story  to Fox 5 News  and we have concealed  her identity  I said to myself  this is a well-known place  he has to be a professional  this Long Island woman  was looking forward  to her massage  in day of beauty  in June  at the Maximus Day Spa 
[02:18:00]  in Westbury  her husband had given her  a gift certificate  for their anniversary  but during the massage  she says masseur  Kyung Joo  sexually assaulted her  he was trying to pull my leg out  and I was very tense  and I'm laying there  with my eyes closed  and all I remember  is him going  and getting the oils  and then all of a sudden  he was in my  lower private area  and I just jumped  yeah  I just jumped  sweet  merciful crap 
[02:18:30]  like  I was very surprised  and I froze  in shock  she says she got dressed  and immediately  told a female employee  I would see this  to tell her crying  what happened  and she just hugged me  and said  it's not right  it's not your fault  it's not your fault  she knew exactly  how I felt  as it turns out  Mr. Joo  is not licensed  as a masseur  in New York  Mr. Joo  alright I recognize  the voice  that's my mom  yeah  that's why  she won't go 
[02:19:00]  the woman is now  suing him  and Maximus Spa  for 31 million dollars  the purpose  of this lawsuit  is really designed  to send a message  to places like Maximus  and other spas  that this kind of  improper behavior  will not be tolerated  I gotta defend  that place though  it's a high end place  oh yeah  and they didn't know  who they were hiring  it seems like  it's just this  this lawyer's like  I gotta give a message  to this place  like this  you know  all the masseuses  over there  are doing this  yeah it seems like  it was just this one guy 
[02:19:30]  and how much  are they suing for  31 million  31 million dollars  I mean  alright  you know  he slips a knuckle  or two  two  two  I mean yeah  it's horrible  you know  it's awful  I'd be  you know  you kick the guy's ass  or something  but  31 million dollars  I'm thinking  you know  the lady should get  like a gift certificate  for like the Outback  right  you get a blooming onion  maybe a steak  right  sure  for 31 million  31 million

[02:41:00]  Jimmy  what's up  buddy  yeah what's  going on  guys  I just  like to  say that  it seems  that Jesse  likes  snatch  tooth  not just  the  critics  you know  very nice  thank you  Jimmy  oh I didn't  mean to do  that  I'm sorry  let's go  to Joe  Joe  what's  going on  yeah what's  up  thank you  yo man  do you think  the population  actually followed  Jesse's gonna  have a problem  with this  most of them  do the same  thing  anyway  I don't  ring the bell  come on  come on  you know  what I'm  talking about 
[02:41:30]  what are we  ringing the bell  for  Joe  Joe  Joe  I think  all races  do this  type  of stuff  no you're  right  if it was  Bishop Daly  this would be  a big thing  on TV  that's why  I didn't  F her  you can't  go F  how old  was this girl  any idea  how old  she was  how old  she was  39  oh it's  talking about  a Twan of  Roy type  of deal  is it now  she was  39 years  old  oh guys  who cares  man  the guys  are bummed  the people 
[02:42:00]  are following  well bummed  and if they  don't see  a problem  with it  they're just  stupid people  anyway  the worst  part of this  for him  is that  he's  stepping out  of the  public eye  because you  know  he loves  that  Pete  what's  going on  hey  what's  up  fellas  hey  you know  what it  is  I heard  the reaction  to Earl  and that's  going to be  a reaction  from the  entire  populace  I don't  want to  use the  n-word  okay  they're all  like Clinton  Clinton gets  a hummer  in the  White House  and we  have to  have  federal  prosecutors  we gotta  have  well  Jesse  but what  Jesse did 
[02:42:30]  was  Jesse did  the smart  thing  Jesse put  his hands  up and  said  you got  me  I made  a mistake  it's all  my fault  I hope  my family  forgive me  I hope  the people  forgive me  so you  know what  we're gonna  do  we're gonna  forgive  them  we're gonna  let it  all go  but Pete  in fairness  I think  everyone forgave  Clinton  as well  no  no  not  before they  dragged him  through the mud  it's like  reverse racism  Clinton gets  hammered  because he  pulls his  knob out  in the  White House  this guy  goes and  has a kid  and everybody 
[02:43:00]  says oh  you gotta  understand  things happen  the Clinton  thing was a lot  more about  perjury  and what not  and he's the  president  but come on  you gotta give  Clinton props  because he  stuck it out  until the  bitter end  and he  denied  denied  denied  stuck it out  was the  problem  maybe that  wasn't the  problem  but  thank you  Pete  guys  good luck  you gotta  give it to  Jesse  he didn't  lie about  it  yeah I  did it  what I  don't  understand  about  like  Jesse  Jackson  and the  president  stuff  these guys  got a lot 
[02:43:30]  of power  can't they  get like  hotter chicks  that seems  to be the  thing  you see  Jesse  Jackson's  chick  in the  post  today  they  want  that's  no  looker  right  there  they  want  girls  that are  going to  shut  up  I  guess  I  guess  Jesse's  chick  shut  up  you know  they can  go  blabbing  about  it  that inquirer  my god  they ought  to hire  those people  for the  CIA  because they  will find  anything on  you  didn't we  have some  info on  this story  like a couple  days ago  yeah  it started  dribbling in  it was  bubbling  it was  bubbling  I saw 
[02:44:00]  something on  Drudge  too  it said  a major  announcement  about  Jesse  and I  kept  refreshing  going  come on  bring it  yeah  Anthony  you did  hear that  Clinton's  getting  an office  like right  next to  us  here  how  hilarious  oh  yeah  where's  it  gonna  be  we will  see  Clinton  on the  streets  of  New York  wait  he's  getting  office  right  across  the  street  we will  probably  bump  into  the  president  I love  the show  can I  come up  for  Tainway  right  Carnegie Hall  he's gonna  be right  at Carnegie  Hall  nice  yeah  what he  already rented  office space  right  yeah 
[02:44:30]  it kind  of blows  up  because it's  gonna  screw  traffic  up  because he's  still got  the  secret  service  and  everything  and isn't  it ironic  that Carnegie  Hall  is where  the voyeur  bus  started out  he could  jump  hey  let me  jump  on  take  a ride  hey  I'm  being  busted  get your  hands  on  Psycho  Mark  I can't  believe  Earl  ducked out  of the  studio  without  saving  his  guy  that's a  Jackson  unbelievable  now we  wonder why  where all  the money  he's  spending  with the  rainbow  coalition  is  going  to  putting  up  his 
[02:45:00]  bitches  in  their  houses  it's  the  bitches  that  it's  the  bitches  that  it  gets  he's  putting  up  all  that  money  that  he  gets  from  the  rainbow  coalition  and  people  thinking  it's  going  to  all  these  good  causes  and  he's  putting  up  his  little  tarts  you know  he refuses  to admit  where any  of that  money  goes  he still  to this  day  refuses  to  admit  of  course  and  now  we  know  he  goes to  nice  suits  and  chicks  chippies  as they  call  little  chippies  Earl  has no 
[02:45:30]  balls  at  all  this  is  his  22  straight  hours  too  man  all  right  mark  just  ponderous  man  if you  think  this is  the first  indiscretion  on jesse's  part  i don't  know  anything  jesse  jackson's  done  in the  past  but  with  this  surfacing  now  and  how  quick  he  fessed  up  to  it  i  can  only  assume  there's  so  many  skeletons  in  that  closet  he  should  have  taken  his  own  advice  stay  out  the  bushes  that's  right  they've  been
