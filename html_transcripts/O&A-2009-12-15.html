<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a raucous discussion of the Tiger Woods infidelity scandal.  Opie and Anthony wildly speculate about the number of women involved,  delving into racist stereotypes regarding their racial demographics.  They discuss specific women linked to Woods, including a 48-year-old with a five-year affair and Rachel Uchitel, focusing on the financial settlements involved. A caller, Mike from Buffalo (a white man married to a Black woman), offers his perspective on the racial dynamics of the scandal.  The hosts then dissect Joy Behar's apology on *The View* for a joke about Uchitel, speculating on the legal pressures behind it and launching into a rant about unethical lawyers. They mention failed attempts to book Giovanni Ribisi and Patton Oswalt as guests.  The conversation touches upon Tiger Woods's Canadian doctor facing a drug investigation and the possibility of Woods using performance-enhancing drugs.  A caller, initially identifying as "Chip" then "Eddie," offers a blunt commentary on male behavior.  The show briefly touches on *The Honeymooners* and Jackie Gleason before concluding this segment with a discussion about appropriate Christmas tips for building staff.  Throughout this segment, the hosts use highly offensive language.

The show continues with a segment focused on the increasingly formalized and obligatory nature of holiday tipping.  Anthony shares an unintentionally offensive joke about tipping a cancer hospital.  Frustration is expressed over the expectation of tipping numerous service providers, with anecdotes about entitled building residents and a milkman retaliating for a missed tip.  The conversation then abruptly shifts to a news story about three masked men displaying Nazi flags at a menorah lighting.  The hosts strongly condemn the act, criticizing the men's cowardice. A caller challenges Anthony's perspective on free speech, prompting a lengthy debate about hate speech, First Amendment rights, and the differing societal reactions to protests by various groups like the Westboro Baptist Church and Black Israelites.  Callers contribute their perspectives, and the segment concludes with continued condemnation of the Nazi flag incident and the perpetrators' cowardice.

The discussion of the First Amendment continues into the next segment, focusing on the rights of hate groups like the KKK and Nazis to protest.  Callers offer varying opinions, highlighting the differing treatment and societal acceptance of different extremist groups.  The hosts then pivot to the cancellation of their planned "Homeless Shopping Spree" event, blaming bureaucratic hurdles, liability concerns, and a lack of cooperation from "Keith the cop" and "Steven Singer."  They brainstorm alternative events, including a talent show, acknowledging the need for sponsor and management approval.  Producer Sam plays a crucial role, running back and forth to gather updates from various individuals within SiriusXM.  The hosts express frustration with the internal processes.

The final segment focuses on the logistical nightmare of producing the alternative "homeless talent show."  The hosts are furious about internal company roadblocks, particularly a scheduling conflict with Cosmo Radio's Christmas sweater fashion show, which requires the main studio.  They express anger towards various company liaisons using expletives. Marcelino is brought in to address equipment issues, which are quickly dismissed. Sam continues to negotiate with Cosmo Radio, reporting back with increasingly negative updates. The hosts discuss using a smaller studio, but this is also hindered by a pre-recorded Catholic radio show.  A caller, Steve, confirms Cosmo Radio's uncooperativeness.  The hosts explore moving the event to Thursday, but face further scheduling conflicts.  Numerous calls are made to resolve scheduling issues, ending with no clear resolution.  The segment includes live reads for Vermont Teddy Bear and Steven Singer Jewelers.  The hosts conclude by expressing profound exhaustion and cynicism towards the company's bureaucratic processes, referencing the earlier failed "Homeless Shopping Spree" and the confiscation of its t-shirts.  The segment is punctuated with frequent profanity and offensive language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is dangerous.  There's nothing in the Bible that says you can't thung an asshole.  Psychotic, sexual, devious.  I just want to take it in the shitter like a good fruit. 
[00:00:30]  Really, it is a very, very bad thing.  Go fuck yourself.  It's unbelievable.  I love it.  We know we're great.  Everyone knows we're great.  Complete horseshit.  This show is never short of cash.  We're just dicks.  We don't get you one way.  We fuck you the other way.  This is like what goes on in a mental institution.  Cookie, cookie, cookie.  Hi, I'm the O.P. and Anthony Virus.  And I'm here to infect you with hilarity.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Morning.  How about it?  Mike, God's man.  Bam.  Bam.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hi, everybody.  Merry morning.  Happy goodness to you. 
[00:01:30]  On this fine, fine Tuesday.  Tuesday.  Only a few days left, right?  Christmas, vacation?  Yep.  Yep.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Doing anything?  What are you doing?  Uh, yeah.  Christmas.  Got that family stuff.  That family crap.  Yeah.  I'm the new Christmas guy. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, you're the go-to house, right?  I'm the new go-to Christmas guy.  I'm turning into the go-to house as well.  Yeah.  Christmas Eve is still, you know, over at Fran and Uncle Tony's house.  But Christmas Day, no, it's like I'm the guy.  I'm the guy.  Well, you got the place.  I know.  Little kids running around.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  You're not invited.  Please stay away.  All right.  Ah, the Tiger news. 
[00:02:30]  What happened with Tiger?  What happened with Tiger?  We both thought of it, and then as you started saying it, why did I think after you said what happened,  I would chime in with the same thing and get it out first.  Like a fucking stereo actum.  I know.  We did stink, too.  I did it at the same time, and it's like, shut up.  It was like a bomb with an echo.  I do love the people that are yelling and screaming.  They're sick of the Tiger stuff.  But you can't be sick of the Tiger Woods stuff until the story has been completely written. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, until it's finished.  How can you be sick of this?  It's like going to a movie and going, you know what?  It's only you walk out after it's three quarters done because you're sick of it.  You're sick of, like, the whole thing the movie's about.  Yeah, this isn't done yet, so you can't be sick of it yet.  I've got to wait for the end.  How can you be sick of a story that just has new facts every day?  Alexander Guttenhoff has not been shot yet.  Yeah, exactly.  Tiger Woods is into cougars, we learned today.  What?  Woman number 14 has come out. 
[00:03:30]  Now, this is where it gets good.  They have completely lost track of how many girls, officially.  Yeah.  The paper's saying she could be girl number 14 or girl number 16.  They're not really sure at this point.  They've lost track, is what happened.  That is fantastic.  And I was telling these guys, if it's 14 or 16, it's got to be twice that.  Because there's got to be girls out there that are like, you know what?  I can't announce to the world that I had sex with Tiger because I'm married. 
[00:04:00]  I got this.  I got that.  Something that's going on.  I have discretion.  I have discretion.  I bet you there's a couple of girls out there that said, yeah.  Let me tell you something.  I would bet you there is more, there are more girls that had sex with Tiger that haven't  said a word than have said something.  Now, that's very interesting.  I really do because I think these are the fucking, you know, the buddinskis that come out of the  woodwork and want to be, maybe be a little famous, maybe get some money, this, that, the  other thing.  But I think there's a lot of girls that probably were married, like you said. 
[00:04:30]  Right.  Um, just discretion and, uh, you know, maybe they saw that Perkins waitress and went, I'm  not putting her up, up on the curve.  Maybe there's some real slobs.  Right.  Oh, man.  Yeah, you're right.  And, and if he is, uh, going to madams and doing the hooker thing, there's a bunch of hookers  that certainly wouldn't be talking, right?  So I would say more, I, I say it's probably hundreds of girls, hundreds, I think in his short 
[00:05:00]  career, what did, uh, Chamberlain have?  What did, uh, oh, Chamberlain was thousands of girls.  But fuck the, the whole career.  I mean, cause everyone is, is focused on the fact that he decided to get married because  he was done with all that womanizing.  We were saying before the show, there's cheating and then there's Tiger Woods.  This is ridiculous.  This is way beyond cheating.  The guy should have never been married.  Yeah.  This is crazy.  He got married and didn't even slow down at all. 
[00:05:30]  No, no.  He was at the same speed before he got married and during his marriage and who knows how  many he's banged since.  Blowjobs at the reception under the fucking dais.  It's like the glasses clean, clean, clean, clean, clean.  He's just fucking getting his dick sucked.  This is a guy that obviously should have never been married.  I mean, why he got married, that's up to him, whatever.  I think it was an image thing to really bring in the sponsors and, uh, bring in the cash.  Maybe he thought it was mellow him out.  Sometimes people get married because they think, look, my life's a little fucking crazy. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Uh, this will settle me down.  You know, guys get married to settle down sometimes and they, it just doesn't work.  Find a good girl.  You settle down.  Why settle down with a different girl every night?  Look at Henry.  Found himself a nice girl.  He's settling down.  Poor thing got his big teeth caught in a bumper.  Giant, dumb tiger teeth.  I saw a profile shot of him.  It's all I think of now is his fucking giant choppers.  His choppers.  He could be, he could file that shit down, man. 
[00:06:30]  A little bit.  A little bit.  Why not?  Teeth are way too big.  So a woman number 14.  I don't think so.  I know.  Exactly.  Or woman number 16, depending on what scorecard you're following.  Yeah.  Tiger, uh, was with a 48 year old, Teresa Rogers.  I guess she's 48 now.  The oldest woman yet who had a five year affair with Tiger before and during his marriage.  How old?  Uh, 48 now.  48 now.  I think Tiger's been married five years, so, you know, 43, 42, somewhere around there. 
[00:07:00]  Uh, she started seeing Tiger.  Rawr.  And it lasted, uh, for five years during his marriage.  His longest reported affair so far.  And you know people call her Terry.  She's this 48 named Teresa.  She probably said he called Terry.  Hey, Terry.  She dresses like some fucking chick from an 80s.  Oh, is that her?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Yeah, the picture's not bad.  She got some collagen lips, though.  Who cares?  They probably suck Tiger's dick really well.  I love those big dick sucking duck lips.  Lick it, Daffy.  Fucking slobber on it and lick it. 
[00:07:30]  If I put an exploding cigar in your mouth.  Oh, you want me to fuck your dick, do ya?  She's fucking sexy.  Yeah, there's a whole other.  Sammy Hagar?  That shitty perm?  Somebody with a perm and a bad blue shirt.  Digitized face, but you see that perm sticking out.  That guy's got the same shirt on that the dude in fucking Boogie Nights had when the Asian kid was dropping firecrackers behind him.  This guy sucks.  The problem with the picture, though, you don't know when it was taken.  Right.  I mean, if it was taken last Christmas, because there is a Christmas tree, or maybe this Christmas, come on. 
[00:08:00]  Come on.  Then, you know, she's not that bad.  No, she's sexy.  But that picture could be 10 years old.  But she looks like one of those, like every time we have one of those sex surrogates in.  Oh, we're having one of those broads in today.  What?  Yeah, we're having, what's her name in?  She's actually a friend of the show, Victoria.  She's on tomorrow.  Oh, tomorrow?  Oh, okay.  Tomorrow, I'm sorry.  Anyone in today?  No, then there's no one in today.  No, guess this is.  I thought we had one.  Nope.  We were supposed to have Giovanni Ribisi, right?  Oh, yeah.  And he canceled on us.  What about him?  I don't know. 
[00:08:30]  I saw him on Fox or Channel 11 yesterday.  With a strange mustache.  Yeah, he's looking at a little.  Just add him to the list of guests we wanted and said yes to that we never got.  Right.  Yeah, there was that one and there was Patton Oswalt.  What happened to him?  I don't know.  I saw his movie just so I could be prepared for the interview.  They could talk about it.  Was he here or not?  He didn't come.  I don't know.  Patton wouldn't blow the show.  I think he wants to come on the show.  No, he does want to come on.  Yeah, I don't know what happened with that.  Maybe that's down the road.  Fuck Patton!  So, yeah, so Tiger's now got a cougar under his belt, too. 
[00:09:00]  All right.  Collect them all, Tiger.  And then that one.  Except for black women, apparently.  Dude, he fucked anybody?  He even had a tan?  There is no one that is below, like, fucking...  You would think there'd be one black broad in there.  One mocha something.  Yeah.  One chick that listened to fucking hip-hop.  Nothing.  Not a black chick and not an Asian chick.  Right.  Like, and he's a mix of both and he just kind of fucking...  Just don't want to touch them.  Just shows the world that white people rule. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, of course.  We all know that.  We all know that secretly, right?  Jesus.  White people rule.  What do we say?  That black girls would talk more than the white girls, so obviously he didn't bang any black broads, right?  You think that's the truth?  Didn't we have that conversation?  Do black girls babble more than fucking white chicks?  You never hear black chicks in the morning scandals, though, man.  I don't know.  Unless they're hookers who get called out.  But you never hear black chicks babbling like this.  Yeah, the Hugh Grant thing where the hooker, you know...  But that was an arrest, wasn't it?  Yeah, I think so.  They got busted on the phone.  Let's get some sisters on the phone.  Do they babble or not? 
[00:10:00]  Let me tell you, if it was a sister, she wouldn't be talking.  Oh, I can't wait.  I've got to hear the hack of fucking black comics on this one.  How about that?  Anybody keep in touch with the Tiger Woods situation?  Everybody?  Yeah, let me tell you.  All them white women Tiger been with?  That's why they're coming out talking.  If there was a black woman, she wouldn't be talking.  No, she'd be getting some Tiger money.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:10:30]  So Tiger's got a cougar in there.  Tiger's got a pig in there.  Mm-hmm.  The Perkins waitress is the pig.  You know, she's famous.  Have we rated these women yet?  Hottest to...  To nautest?  Hottest to nautest.  Perkins Waitress, right at the fucking bottom of the barrel.  Who would you put it as number one, though?  Not Rachel. 
[00:11:00]  Number one, I would put that fucking...  Rachel's solid, man.  No, no, no.  She's not solid.  You take those fucking Ray-Bans off her face, she's got googly eyes.  Am I the only one that notices the googly eyes?  Fuck that chick.  No, that blonde.  What's her name?  Young Jungers.  Jamie Jungers?  She's awful.  Jamie Jungers.  I saw a picture of her.  She looked like a big fatso yesterday.  No, she...  What?  That picture of her...  She might have Tiger's kid in her belly.  Oh, fuck.  No, I'd take...  She was Jungers.  Jamie Jungers?  Chimichungers. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, that...  She looked pretty hot in that picture where she's kind of laying down with a bikini thingy on.  That's where Voss would try to be smart and keep the J's silent.  It's Jamie Jungers.  Jamie Jungers.  Don't you know pronunciations?  All right, we got a guy married to a black chick.  Hey.  Buffalo, what's up?  Yo, this is Mike from Buffalo.  How y'all, man?  Hi, Mike.  Hey, Mike, what do you got going?  So you're a white guy married to a black woman or a black guy?  Do I sound like a white boy?  You sound so black.  Come on, Jimmy.  No, but you do sound like a black guy, but you never know. 
[00:12:00]  Come on.  If you're a white guy who married a black girl, you might have a different inflection.  Call it a wigger.  I'm not with that, man.  You know, white people are wonderful, but I don't want to marry one of them.  Yeah, I hear you.  I agree.  But dig it.  Yeah, like I said, man, black chicks in that situation with Tiger, first of all, I think  it's, well, I think Jimmy made the observation that he didn't have any black chicks, man.  I just, black people really don't care anything about Tiger.  I mean, to tell you the truth, man, I mean, because he is, when he came out with that  calibration bullshit, whenever he, you know, they asked him about his, you know, ethnic 
[00:12:30]  background, man, we were pretty much done with it.  So, basically, the black community is laughing at him right now.  Because he doesn't like considering himself black, right?  Not at all.  And, I mean, like I said, you don't have to go around with a picket sign saying how black  you are, but at the same time, man, you know, you are with your eyes.  He's half Asian, too, right?  Yeah, he is.  He likes to say he's Blasian or something.  Okay, if he slapped a white woman and they had to describe him to the police, would Asian  come up?  Hell no. 
[00:13:00]  That's how you gauge it.  How would they be described to the police?  How are you, yeah, how would you describe on a police report?  That's how we always...  Black male.  That's right.  Yeah, black male.  Slender.  You are what you are.  I mean, Jimmy, am I right?  Straight up.  Am I right, Jimmy?  Well, unless it was in the Daily News, they wouldn't describe race at all.  They'd say the man attacked her.  He was carrying a golf club and wearing a hat.  That'd be the entire description.  Two arms, two legs.  Yeah, no one's arguing with you, man.  I don't think black people, I don't think black community, I'm not saying that they go for 
[00:13:30]  infidelity, but they're not as likely as a group to crucify a guy for infidelity.  No.  Which I think is right, because it's phony to crucify this guy when everybody knows that  most men in his position would be as weak as he was.  But it's hard to...  It's the image he built up.  Yeah, exactly.  But he didn't build up...  No, man, come on.  There's weakness and then there's complete stupidity.  The guy never slowed down when he got married.  The contrast...  He didn't even go, wow, this marriage thing is cool, and then get weak. 
[00:14:00]  It doesn't matter.  The contrast of the image he built up compared to what it looks like now is ridiculous.  You take someone like Kobe, which is a whole different situation, no one was like, holy  shit, I'm shocked.  He cheated on a lot.  Because it's different.  Tiger was one of those...  He was one of those athletes who wanted a tussle.  He looked like, oh, come here, Tiger.  And believe me, that image was finally cultured and scripted by his father and him and fucking 
[00:14:30]  agents, managers.  He probably had somebody just for his image to sell his image.  And maybe someone said, you know, you really need to get married to keep this image thing  going.  Have a couple kids, settle down.  I agree with Anthony.  Like I said, the handcrafted, polished image, man.  I mean, in the end, like you said, you got millions of dollars and a dick.  You're going to mess up.  We all know that. 
[00:15:00]  Right, Anthony?  But anybody...  That happens.  Exactly.  But the thing is, when you handcrafted an image, and like you said, he's been, you know,  like I said, he's just been put up on his pedestal, man.  And America loves to see people fall.  Yep.  So it's just his turn, man.  And me personally, I, you know...  I'm amazed.  I feel sorry for him because I'm on my way to work doing a job I don't want to do for  him.  I hear you.  What?  What I'm more amazed at is that it took this long for all this stuff to come out.  I mean, it seems like a lot of people knew what he was up to.  And how this media is and how this culture is, you're surprised they didn't try to tear 
[00:15:30]  him down, you know, two, three years ago.  But the thing is, though, Anthony, I mean, Opie, is that you look at stuff, I mean, it's  such a subliminally racist society in a lot of ways.  You're talking about a guy who was a golfer, right?  You're talking about a golfer versus a basketball player.  Now, we all think a basketball player is going to lay pikes.  Right.  You know, they're seven foot tall and cocked down on their knees.  It's just a stereotype, a subliminal stereotype, that you would fall into that. 
[00:16:00]  You would really believe Kobe Bryant was sticking broad in.  Of course.  Exactly.  I get what you're saying.  Surprise there.  As far as golf goes, when you thought crazy golfer, you thought John Daly.  After John Daly, and this is a question for the true golf fans out there, did you think  of anybody else on the entire PGA Tour that might be womanizing and drinking and drugging?  No.  No.  Maybe the shark in his early days.  Maybe the shark, Greg Norman.  Don't forget, too, we knew, growing up, you know football players, you know basketball,  you know jocks, and you know the way they are. 
[00:16:30]  They're alpha males, they bang the hot cheerleaders, so you always associate jocks.  None of us growing up knew golfers.  That's true.  You didn't know any golfers, and if you did, you wanted to smack them in the mouth.  You didn't know any golfers that were like, oh, that guy gets a lot of pussy.  Yeah.  So that's another reason this comes from way out of left field.  Yeah.  So, yeah.  All right.  Left field's baseball, Jimmy.  No, it's not.  Comes way out from out of bounds.  All right, Mike.  Thanks a lot, man.  Comes from the sand trap.  All right, listen. 
[00:17:00]  So let's continue with this.  So then the Rachel Broad, she was one of the first to come out, right?  She's the Ray-Ban girl.  Oh, right, right, right.  I'm telling you, find a picture without the glasses on.  Her eyes are horrendous.  Her eyes are going crazy.  They are going crazy.  They look in two different directions.  Will reportedly receive $1 million annually for the next five years to keep her mouth shut.  What?  How does this shit come out?  How does this shit come out?  $1 million annually for five years to keep her mouth shut.  So basically, it's a $5 million deal that she just got to keep her mouth shut about Tiger. 
[00:17:30]  What's the difference between her and the guy blackmailing Letterman, really?  And, yeah.  Or her and a prostitute.  Absolutely.  Well, she's not fucking anymore.  Well, she did fuck, and now she's getting $5 million.  That's fantastic.  So what the fuck does she know?  Yeah.  She must have audio and video.  Or the Tiger Woods people really fucked up, thinking it was going to stop, but Rachel  will go, all right, let's squash this, pay her off, and then everyone else comes out  of the woodwork.  They must be going, ah, fuck, we just wasted $5 million.  Yeah.  We just wasted $5 million. 
[00:18:00]  Tiger, yeah, we got her.  No, that's okay.  We're paying her off.  This thing will go away quick.  Don't you worry about it.  She's not going to say a word.  She promised.  Yeah, $5 million.  Yeah, drop in the bucket.  No problem.  Yeah.  Hold on.  My phone's ringing.  My other phone.  Hold on.  Hello?  Holy shit.  And then it's a telethon.  It's just a phone bank that's ringing off the hook.  Yes, our phones are ringing here.  We'll send you money.  Yelling to his assistant.  Can you get phone number 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12? 
[00:18:30]  What's the tote up to, ladies and gentlemen?  Let's get a tote.  Right.  And as far as the Rachel girl goes, Joy Behar had to apologize on The View yesterday.  What?  We love the apology because it's a fake apology.  What a doody.  It's the, you better read this or you're fired apology.  I'm sure Joy Behar did not want to apologize for anything she said about Rachel.  In this case, I believe she was basically saying that Rachel, I think, was paid money.  That she might have been a hooker. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, before the fact.  Right.  And Joy Behar now had to apologize because Rachel insisted and said I was not a hooker or something like that.  So here's the fake apology.  These are all fake bullshit fucking apologies that people have to read to save their ass.  InTouch Weekly claims and has emails of Tiger Woods telling alleged mistress, Rachel, what have you said?  You can tell.  You can tell.  You can tell.  You can tell she's a hooker.  I couldn't fuck as a hooker.  You can tell she's a hooker.  Is that a putain?  You can tell she's a putain. 
[00:19:30]  Rachel, you walked into that one, girl.  You can tell she's a hooker.  That's a pretty good line.  That's a funny joke.  I like that line.  Play on words with her name.  So wait, she had to apologize for her joke?  Wow.  I would like to know the definition of a hooker because if you read up on...  Someone who fucks for money.  Yeah, but I mean, what is the money part of it?  And it's a joke.  What is the money part of it?  I mean, what if you're getting paid to go away on vacation? 
[00:20:00]  What if you're getting paid to...  Do you know what I mean?  Exactly.  Was that Gloria Allred her lawyer?  Oh, yeah.  That's why.  That fucking awful Gloria Allred probably threatened to sue and they figured it's just easier.  Even though she was kidding and it was a wordplay joke, that's got to be it.  What else could it be?  How the fuck do you have...  You can't apologize for a joke.  I thought like parody is protected under the First Amendment.  Of course it is, Bea.  And that's kind of a very parody on the name, a wordplay...  But the thing is you still... 
[00:20:30]  You know, she could be...  Their argument could be, well, a reasonable person could think that you were really saying  you could tell she's a hooker.  Again, that's ridiculous, but...  Well, here's Joy apologizing on yesterday's show.  Joy?  Yeah.  You have something you need to know.  Oh, yes.  I have to clear something up.  During a...  Oh, I feel bad for her.  Joy, you have something to say.  And it's like they're trying to make it like it's off the cuff.  Like, Whoopi had to remind her.  Meanwhile, she's sitting there steaming the whole time.  Believe me.  Of course.  Steaming that she has to fucking utter an apology to this fucking got a settlement from 
[00:21:00]  tiger bitch.  Yeah.  See, I won't have to apologize.  That's what she did.  Because some dumb suit, you know, said you better apologize.  And they even write it for you.  You don't even have to write your own apology.  How great is that?  She was a...  Wasn't she fucking a married man?  She was fucking a married guy?  And now she's thinking...  Fucking a married man, are you?  Mr. Grady?  And now she's taking a settlement.  I mean, that's my understanding of it.  So if she's doing that, why can't you make fun of her?  She's now a public figure.  Sorry, toots. 
[00:21:30]  You're not a private citizen.  And she technically...  Judy apologized for that.  I'm very, very sorry.  And she technically just took money for having...  For having sex.  For having sex with Tiger Woods.  Yeah, so she called her a baton or whatever the fucking word is on hooker.  Technically, though, she just made five million.  Why did she make five million?  For having sex with Tiger and keeping her mouth shut.  To keep her mouth shut about the relationship she had with Tiger.  Exactly.  What the fuck?  Some repulsive lawyer fucking probably called the repulsive lawyers over there.  And they put that fucking repulsive, no contract honoring fucking lawyer fucking heads together. 
[00:22:00]  And then came up with that.  Lawyer sucked dick.  Wow, that was a lot of info.  I like that.  There was a little too much info in there.  They just...  It's a fucking...  It's a profession that has integrity only when put next to pedophiles and fucking those that stone adulterers to death.  It really is true.  A lawyer...  You sure you weren't talking about a few different situations there, Jimmy?  No, just in general.  I'm very generalizing.  All right.  You generalizing?  They're despicable, fucking... 
[00:22:30]  They seek ambiguous language to avoid doing what the right thing is.  They're fucking pukey.  Loopholes.  Disgusting.  You're right.  I've never met one that I fucking sat down with in a room and fucking respected.  Never.  Dumb motherfuckers.  The way you think.  Exactly the way I think.  They only look...  They only look almost human.  Right.  When they're sitting next to the fucking scumbag they're defending that just like raped a 12-year-old. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  That's when they...  Oh, they're upstanding and trying to help.  They're terrible.  They're fucking terrible.  They don't ever seek to do the right thing.  You know two lawyers were discussing something like that.  One wouldn't call and go, look, did she say this about my client or did he say this about my client?  And the other person would go, yeah, but it's a joke.  And you know, the lawyer would go, all right.  Yeah, I know it was rhetorical hyperbole or whatever.  You know that discussion didn't go on.  Oh, yeah.  That's never happening.  It's never about doing the right thing.  It's always...  Carlin was brilliant when he talked about businessmen and how he hates the businessman. 
[00:23:30]  And their whole job is to fuck the other guy in negotiation.  And just what despicable scumbags they are.  They really are.  Despicable fucking people.  Instead of having a true understanding between two people for the best interest of both parties,  it's I will fuck you in the ass and you will try to fuck me in the ass  and we'll just chase each other around the room.  And it's not even that they're so smart and above it.  I've sat down in enough rooms with these guys in all different situations. 
[00:24:00]  I've never found one that I respected intellectually.  I really haven't.  No, they're usually dummies.  They're dumb.  They just know how to fuck other people by learning through experience.  That's right.  Fucking all those years of college, that's the best argument you can put up, you dumb motherfucker.  Most of them are nameless and faceless.  Dude, exactly.  I don't even know where the lawyers hang out around here.  Or anywhere.  You never know where they hang out in any company.  I know the influence of this show dramatically.  It's somewhere between the toilet and the Hudson River. 
[00:24:30]  That's where all lawyers hang out.  You never know where they are.  Where are they?  Never.  Have I bumped into any of these guys?  Dude, I don't know.  I don't even know if I bumped into one here or at XM or at CBS.  I wouldn't know one unless it's sniffing up my leg under the fucking table.  Like a parasite.  They're always close enough to pop their fucking heads up when something happens.  Absolutely.  Always close enough to just, doink, here I am.  Well, let's listen to the Joy Behar apology here.  We just went a little off-road there.  Nah, but it's perfect.  You guarantee that's the discussion that happened. 
[00:25:00]  We're bouncing right back on the highway.  That's what happened here.  We called another lawyer, called another lawyer.  I guarantee that's what happened.  We demand an apology.  We're not cease and desist.  Listen closely to Joy's voice here.  You can tell there's no Joy in her voice.  That's a pretty good one.  I had the car driver cracking up last night.  Joy, you have something you need.  Oh, yes.  I have to clear something up.  During a discussion on Thursday's show about the alleged affair between Tiger Woods and Rachel  Yucatel, I made a joke.  I made a play on Miss Yucatel's name. 
[00:25:30]  This was intended only as a joke.  And I apologize for the choice of words and for any misimpression the joke may have created.  And we'll be right back.  That has to be in front of a lawsuit.  That has to be.  That was so red.  She read that fucking thing verbatim.  Our society just sucks on the big dick of fucking hell.  We suck.  Because you know what happens now?  Oh, she apologized.  Okay, everything's good now.  Yeah.  She doesn't mean that apology. 
[00:26:00]  She absolutely doesn't mean that.  And she shouldn't mean that apology.  She was forced to do that.  But then after you're forced to do it, everything's okay?  How does that make sense?  How is Yucatel, she's a hooker, taken as a real statement?  It's a joke.  Yeah, it's a play on words.  If her name was something else.  If her name was Suckadick.  If her name was Suckadick.  If her name was, say, what's another sexy name?  Rachel Betsy Bottoms.  Her name was Rachel Betsy Bottoms.  And she said, you could tell she's a hooker.  Well, that's different.  Now you're making a real statement.  Yeah. 
[00:26:30]  It's her name.  Love of God.  All right.  How they made her apologize, I don't know.  I feel bad for her.  We've been in that situation, certainly.  Joy's a comic.  She never asks other people to apologize.  The comic.  No, you could tell.  And she was reading it really fast.  You know.  Yeah, and it was worded very legally.  Of course it was.  Legally.  The alleged affair.  He gave her $5 million to not have an affair.  Tiger's a dope.  Allegedly a dope.  Why is she getting paid if she's not a hooker? 
[00:27:00]  Well, she's not a hooker.  I'm not saying she is.  No, no.  Why would she get paid?  Exactly.  If you're getting $5 million for your time with Tiger Woods, what's that about?  Why don't you explain that?  Yeah.  Some other Tiger bullet points, and we'll move on here.  What's that watch company at?  Tag.  Tag Heuer.  No, no.  It's Tag-yar.  Tag-yar.  Oh.  Says it will spend the next few weeks assessing its relationship with Tiger.  Tag-whore?  What?  No.  Tag-whore.  It's Tag-whore.  Tag-whore.  Tag-whore.  The watch company. 
[00:27:30]  So they're not really sure what to do with Tiger yet.  They're obviously on the fence.  Here's the big bombshell for today, besides the cougar thing.  Tiger's Canadian doctor is under criminal investigation for drug violations in the U.S. and Canada.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, Tiger had some kind of procedure done.  Blood.  What the fuck was it called?  Blood.  I don't know.  They fucking do something with your blood.  Thinner?  Not thinner.  Doping?  Not doping either.  Blood clot.  No.  Bumble clot. 
[00:28:00]  Bumble clot.  Bussy clot.  Roz clot.  What the fuck is it?  I read it.  It was too early, though.  What's that?  Something with his blood?  It's kind of a controversial procedure or something.  Whatever.  After the break, we'll get more of that.  Melanin removal?  Whatever.  That sounds intriguing.  I know.  I don't have it in front of me, though, man.  Hold on, man.  Maybe I can.  Damn.  All right. 
[00:28:30]  How about we try this?  Okay.  Yeah, okay.  The Canadian doctor who performed a controversial medical procedure on Tiger Woods is under criminal  investigation for drug violations on both sides of the border.  Dr. Tony Galea was arrested in October, and his Toronto clinic was raided by Canadian authorities  after his assistant was detained at the U.S.-Canadian border, blah, blah, blah, reportedly  found to be in possession of illegal drugs, including human growth hormone, HGH.  We know that one, right?  And something called Actovegan, I think, a drug extracted from calf's blood that has been banned 
[00:29:00]  by the World Anti-Doping Agency.  Galea flew towards his Florida home at the request of his agents to treat the golfer earlier this  year with his platelet-rich plasma injection therapy, also known as blood spinning.  Okay.  Oh.  I have no idea what that is.  Platelet?  Mm.  Yeah.  Blood platelets.  Galea has attracted a mystique in sports medicine circles for his advocacy of the process, which 
[00:29:30]  involves spinning blood in a centrifuge and re-injected into injured joints in the hope  of accelerating healing.  Mm.  It's a bit suspicious, no?  I guess it separates it from the plasma, and then you get a little thickness of the blood  and put it in there, extra platelets.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Mm.  So the doctor that he was using seems like he's a bad boy. 
[00:30:00]  He's got that HGH.  And are there any allegations that Tiger had this done?  Is that what it is?  Well, I can tell you this much.  Over the years, people were talking and wondering if he was on the roids.  Yeah.  It was never proven.  No.  But, I mean, he was jacked.  Everyone knows he was big-time jacked.  Did they test in the PGA?  I believe so, Anthony.  I believe so.  He could have been cycling during that time.  Yeah.  I believe.  Yeah.  Who knows?  But there were those type of rumors over the years with Tiger Woods. 
[00:30:30]  Pop Eater, as we move on, reports Tiger might move to France temporarily to escape the  media.  That's where everyone goes, though.  France?  Everyone goes to fucking France when they want to get away.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Uh, we did the Rachel thing.  And then Nike is definitely, uh, sticking behind, um, uh, standing behind Tiger Woods.  Uh, and they're calling it a minor blip.  God bless Nike for that.  A minor blip?  They're calling it a minor blip.  This is a minor blip?  With their relationship. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  Just a minor blip.  All right.  Good look.  Keep up your good nature.  So that's your Tiger Woods, uh, update, I guess.  I, I have, I have to, uh, make an apology.  Oh.  Yeah, Jimmy.  To any pedophiles or pet arrests I may have offended by the association with attorneys.  I want to apologize to you.  All you do is ruin lives while they're young, whereas attorneys do it to us from the age  of five to the age of 90.  My apology.  From birth to death, they really are there fucking you over. 
[00:31:30]  I apologize to all pedophiles.  At least you can't help yourself.  Very good.  Oh, look at how many apologies are being accepted here on, uh, our fan base.  It's funny.  Uh, worth pointing out, a lot of people noticed that Whoopi was very pissed off in that clip,  too.  Of course.  Because she's a comic as well.  A comic?  Because now, now the comics are being, well, the comics are being insulted because they  know what they were doing.  They, they were just making a fucking joke.  A little, like, uh, wordplay like you guys were saying. 
[00:32:00]  The comics will never fucking want to sit and apologize for especially a very witty  and quick off-the-cuff joke that you make.  You don't want to have to apologize for it.  You don't want to be fired for it.  That's for shit sure.  Uh, uh, we always talk about how we're just here live.  Um, what suit doesn't get it, though?  What suit doesn't get it?  What suit doesn't get the fact that, you know, there's no names to these people.  That's what I'm saying.  It's some memo that comes down from this fucking room somewhere.  But they should understand that they're more than covered and protected. 
[00:32:30]  They don't want to spend money fucking defending it.  So you, so you throw your, well, they should be, yes.  So you throw your people to the fucking wolves.  That's it.  All the time that happens in media.  Uh, millions of dollars in litigation or, uh, from some, uh, chick that obviously wants  attention or we can just have her apologize and end it, uh, tomorrow.  You know what's going to happen.  They run it through the fucking corporate Plinko machine and it spits out apology.  It wouldn't even be a million dollars litigation for that one. 
[00:33:00]  That one right there would be very, very easily handled on a motion to dismiss.  Quick settle.  That one will be a very easily motion to dismiss because the whole thing is right there.  Yeah.  And it's on video.  And this is what she said.  Here's the context.  Yes, she said it.  There's no basis to, uh, to, to sue or to, or to win a lawsuit.  Just, they would have won that immediately, but you know, they're getting their lawyers  to court this and that.  Right.  Yeah.  Plus the money.  That's true. 
[00:33:30]  And they're, they're all about their fucking bottom line.  Now it's nothing about like, oh God, ethical, well, I mean, things, dignity, uh, things,  you know, repulsive.  Yeah.  Repulsive.  It's the right thing to do, defending, um, somebody, this, defending one of your employees  because they're right.  Things like that.  That doesn't matter.  Gone.  Of course.  Now you have to blurt out, uh, uh, a typewritten, insincere, completely insincere apology. 
[00:34:00]  And then it goes away.  Even though everyone knows Joy Behar, Joy Behar absolutely did not mean that.  How could she?  Yeah, she's a comic.  She's funny.  She's a comedian.  She's being funny.  Funny line.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  You get yourself thrown on your ass too for funny off the cuff lines.  Yep.  That's what it is.  That's what like live TV and radio is about.  Has that girl come out and apologized to Tiger's wife publicly?  Um, did she?  Yeah, really.  She's all concerned.  Which one did? 
[00:34:30]  Number five?  Uh.  I forgot which number apologized.  Said she was deeply sorry, which was a poor choice of words.  Yeah.  Who was it?  I don't even know.  You can't keep track of her anymore.  Has Rachel, you can tell, has she said she was sorry?  I mean, maybe she has.  I haven't heard it.  She ain't talking.  They're photographing her everywhere.  She's loving the attention.  Yeah, I guess so.  And she ain't saying shit because she made this deal, allegedly.  Well, it looks pretty, pretty much like she did make the deal.  I was, uh, yeah, that was one of my funny lines on Red Eye, by the way. 
[00:35:00]  What?  They played her apology and she said she was deeply sorry.  And I go, you know, with everything that happened, she probably could have used better  choice of words.  No kidding.  Than deeply sorry.  That was her?  I go, with me, it's always, I'm, uh, you know, inadequately sorry.  That's funny.  Oh, I'm a pisser on that show.  The word you're looking for is card.  And I agree.  You are a card.  Here's the broad.  What's her name?  Corey, uh, Corey, uh, Corey wrist or something.  Corey wrist.  Corey wrist.  Wrist without the W.  She was crying on the Today Show yesterday. 
[00:35:30]  I, I remember this one.  And, uh, she was very upset that they were calling her a hooker too or something.  Right?  Because when they're calling these girls hookers, nobody thinks that they're like Craigslist  hookers.  No, there are people are insulting you because they feel that when there's payouts or discussions  with lawyers over things you did and you're involving money, we always associate prostitution  as being some type of a sexual trist with money.  Right.  It's an insult, you dummy.  Stop it.  Nobody is saying that literally, you're a prostitute.  Nobody thinks that.  No, it's the same thing as calling your friend like, hey, you faggot. 
[00:36:00]  Get over here, fag.  You know he's not sucking your cock unless he's sucking your cock.  Yeah, unless he's a good friend.  Then you can't call him that because that's, uh, homophobic.  You know he's not sucking your cock unless he's your producer.  Yes.  But you're absolutely right.  When somebody says, uh, oh God, you fucking hook her.  It doesn't mean she, yeah, she's a set up business.  It's look, you fucked this man.  He gave you things, uh, a presence and money or whatever. 
[00:36:30]  And then, uh, you came out in public and started babbling about it.  What do you expect?  Give me the daily news, please.  The daily news.  You know, it's, um, New York's photo paper.  You know what that is?  That's a box camera between daily and news, by the way.  Oh, I like that.  Yeah, see?  Because they're known for their photographs.  I like that.  I never knew what that little thing was.  I never knew. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, God damn it, fucking Matsui left.  Yeah.  God damn it.  Damn it, the angels.  Hold on, let's continue with Corey.  Shit.  We can move on to that.  No, that's, I just saw the little chopstick legs.  Because there's someone that we know that's involved with this story.  Corey Rist, a big apple blonde, outed as another of Woods' many mistresses, tearfully insisted  yesterday she was no hooker.  Uh, Rist told NBC's Today Show, Woods never paid for his pleasure.  Oh, Paul was just doing very well with you.  Oh, look up!  She spoke out, this is where we have a connection, sort of, after Jason Itzler. 
[00:37:30]  Itzler, yes.  He's been on this show a few times.  Yes, he's a psychopath.  Uh, the so-called king of all pimps claims she worked for him as a $1,000 an hour call  girl.  The 31-year-old divorced mom and former dancer at the Penthouse Executive Club in Manhattan  was first tied to Woods by the news, uh, Russian Molloy.  There you go.  But Itzler's saying that she worked for him.  So she's saying no, she didn't. 
[00:38:00]  So what, is she gonna go sue, uh, Itzler now?  I don't even know where the fuck he is, he calls me sometimes, leaves me crazy messages.  You don't think that motherfucker has records?  He, he would back up his shit, right?  I hope so.  Records?  Why would you keep records then?  These madams, the, one madam, one girl said she wasn't a hooker, and the madam goes,  really?  Well, let me show you some tax statements.  What is this?  One of these girls?  Another one of these girls.  Oh, good.  Good.  Wow.  Said, really?  Well, let me show you that I, I paid you for something.  Yeah.  This guy loves pussy. 
[00:38:30]  He loves pussy.  He sure does.  It's amazing how much Tiger Woods loves white pussy.  Which is fine.  It just is fine.  Nothing wrong with it.  He's acting like, uh, you know.  A man.  A man and one of these, you know, powerful athletes.  He should, he should be outside.  He should be, he, he's sequestering himself.  I'll say it again, though.  What's amazing is he never slowed down.  Nope.  Through his marriage.  Or so it seems.  That's what's amazing.  When your image is at this point, which is shot as far as what it was and what it is 
[00:39:00]  now, start getting out.  Get out there.  Your wife's out pumping gas.  They're saying he's close to a nervous breakdown.  Really?  That came out too.  Really?  Yeah.  He's close to a nervous breakdown.  He probably looks at pictures of his father on the wall thinking how his father crafted  that Tiger image for years.  Tiger probably doesn't even know who he is.  And he's got to look at his father and just be like, I'm sorry, Daddy.  Daddy, I'm so sorry. 
[00:39:30]  I did bad things.  I'm so sorry.  I did bad things.  Show me how you make a putt.  Show me with your hands how you make a putt.  A couple of beautiful girls here at Perkins.  Where are you going besides not college?  Tiger in his house.  I'm sorry.  I did so many bad things. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, Tiger.  I tried to do the right thing, but I'm weak.  I'm too fucking weak.  Aww.  A couple of great beautiful girls, isn't it?  Where were you tonight?  The Kit Kat Club?  You ever suck a guy's cock?  I love that.  What a question.  The bad golfer.  Amazing.  But he doesn't know who he is.  His father made him. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  He has no clue who he is.  He's like a fucking cyborg?  Yeah.  Was that that just found out he's a robot?  Probably.  Oh, my God.  Imagine that.  Probably.  Just found out he's a robot.  Robots hate that, by the way.  When they think they're human.  Like salvation.  Yeah.  And then they open up and just go, oh, no.  I'm a fucking robot.  Well, fuck.  Where do my memories come from?  They were put in you.  Ah, shit.  Yeah, that's really a drag for a robot.  Oh.  Anthony Columbus. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, Anthony.  Yeah, I was wondering if you guys had heard about the vitamin P allergy, where the tiger  might have it, you know, just needing to get through pussy all the time, you know, for  medical reasons.  Fuck's sake, man, you're amateur.  Boo!  Boo!  Okay, target.  What's next?  Asshole!  Those five clips say nothing but bomb.  What perfect clips to play.  Oh, Christ. 
[00:41:30]  Fuck.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  The show said open bomb bay doors before that joke.  Pilot to bombardier.  Let's see how the chip in Jersey chip.  Robert Shaw was on the Indianapolis after they delivered that joke.  Delivered the joke.  The vitamin P joke.  Chip, what do you got, buddy?  Hey.  Is your name Chip? 
[00:42:00]  Oh, my God.  Sure is.  Why didn't you talk?  Buddy.  You're on the air!  Go!  Is your name Chip?  No.  That's a microphone.  All right, but I'm talking to you, so what's your name, man?  My name's Eddie.  All right, what do you got, bro?  Hey, listen, I want to tell all men, no fucking apologies.  We're cavemen.  It's as simple as that.  We hunt, we gather, we fuck.  End the conversation.  That's great.  What's that?  The monologue for what's the other thing with the caveman?  Boo.  Oh, Jesus.  No, no, what's the... 
[00:42:30]  Hold on.  I can't look at Jimmy right now.  No, wait, wait.  Hold on.  All right.  What's the caveman play, honoring the caveman or remembering the caveman?  It's a fucking...  I'm not saying the joke was good, but it sounds like...  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  I know what it is.  Oh, I know what it is.  Defending the caveman.  It was a fucking play.  Oh, da-da-da-da-da.  Oh, da-da-da-da-da. 
[00:43:00]  Be more funny.  This is going great.  What's the fuck?  Caveman, something about a caveman.  I think that was a caveman.  I know.  I should have cut my losses.  Taken my booing.  Next time, think twice before you...  What happened?  I wish I remember that line.  Nothing happened.  Next time, think twice before you play kowtow to your whimsy.  Oh, God.  I'd love to hate that, but it's a great line.  Monaghan.  Kowtow to your whimsy. 
[00:43:30]  Kowtow to your whimsy.  Hello, dear.  I won't be home, dear.  I love those old sitcoms.  They set things up so fast.  Hello, we've got a problem here.  My manager's gone and Cramden's taking over.  In three seconds, the whole episode was established.  Exactly.  Finally, when his wife calls Marshall and he's got to step out of the room, it's hysterical.  Yes, dear, I'll be here at the office for a while.  You know he hasn't fucked that wife in years.  And you know exactly what's about to happen, but it's still funny.  Yes, I'll be out for exactly four minutes. 
[00:44:00]  No one better come in here, dear.  Kowtow to your whimsy.  The hat.  When Ralph goes to grab the hat off of Marshall or Monaghan's desk.  And he...  And that...  Whatever the noise is, only a fucking funny guy would do that.  It's hysterical.  I just might go with her.  All right, I won't say a word.  I won't say a word.  I won't say a word to you or to your mother.  That'll suit me just fine.  At least that way, there won't be any arguments. 
[00:44:30]  There won't be any arguments.  You think because I don't say a word, there won't be an argument?  Are you kidding?  I'll bet you a million dollars that she won't be in this apartment three minutes before she starts an argument.  And I won't have to say a word, Alice.  Three minutes.  You know why?  She'll start an argument without a word for me.  Oh, okay.  It's later on.  The mother.  The flabber mouth.  She doesn't even acknowledge him when she sits down, too. 
[00:45:00]  She looks right past him.  Just like, ah, and just starts bashing him.  I'm glad to sit down.  She's wearing glad the clock off the refrigerator.  This probably was one of the funniest of the 39.  The flabber mouth.  He has a alarm clock on the table next to him.  You know, Alice, I wish you didn't live so far from the subway.  Oh, mother, it's only three blocks.  Yeah, three long blocks.  But I suppose you can't do any better with a rent that you can afford. 
[00:45:30]  He's just fuming.  Are you getting enough to eat?  Of course I am, mother.  You wouldn't say that if you could see our food bill.  Well, I don't doubt the bills are high.  But how much of the food are you getting?  He's looking at the clock.  He's so pissed.  What a cunt.  Don't you worry about me.  I feel just fine.  Well, I hope so.  My goodness. 
[00:46:00]  A little food is the least you can get out of marriage.  Oh, Ralph has got tickets for a Broadway show tonight.  It's called Murder Strikes Out.  Oh, that.  Oh, I had a neighbor, Mrs. Finley.  She saw it.  She didn't think much of it.  Really?  It was supposed to be such a big hit.  The paper said it's a very exciting mystery.  Oh, the paper.  That's just a lot of publicity.  All that to do about chills and suspense.  And that nonsense about don't tell your friends the surprise ending.  Well, it was no surprise to Mrs. Finley.  She said she knew all the time that it wasn't the uncle who committed the murder. 
[00:46:30]  It was the husband.  There he goes.  You are a blah, blah, blah.  He's right in her face.  Pointing.  He throws her mother out.  He is so in her face in that scene.  Dude, he can be so fucking funny silently. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, he didn't say a word that whole time.  He's just stewing in this rage.  It's fucking the funniest guy ever.  Jackie Gleason was the fucking funniest guy ever.  Absolutely fucking ever.  That's why you can still watch those shows and just laugh your balls off at shit you've  seen a thousand times.  The show is fucking, you know, from the mid-50s, early mid-50s, and you still watch it.  And he's just rubbing his big fat mouth, stewing, as this cunt criticizes him to her daughter. 
[00:47:30]  How many fucking shows now, in 50 fucking years, are even going to be watchable?  None, because they wouldn't show a guy pointing at a woman's face screaming.  No.  They would never show real, just male anger.  Even though that was over the top, he's yelling at this bitch because he hates her.  Yeah.  Never would you see that.  The husband would do some goofy line, apparently.  Yeah.  Apparently.  They'd turn him into an idiot.  The word apparently is ruined comedy.  Apparently.  Some smug joke. 
[00:48:00]  That mother of yours, oh, she's quite the card.  Apparently she's like, shut up.  I like when he just goes, would I like to belt you?  Dude.  He's threatening to punch his wife in the face.  He wants to belt her.  Makes a fist, swings it at her.  One of my favorites was, why don't you shut up?  Why don't you shut up?  Why don't you shut up?  It's fucking fantastic, man.  Let's go to Uncle Mark.  Uncle Mark.  Huh? 
[00:48:30]  Oh, no, Uncle Mark.  I've got to tell you, my favorite line from the Honeymooners is when Ralph Barges is in  the door and he goes, Alex, Alex, I'm the king.  I'm the king and you're nothing.  And she goes, yeah, Ralph, you're the king and nothing.  That's funny.  I like, he goes, I don't want my salary to leak out.  And she goes, your salary couldn't drip out.  Drip out.  Wow, is she fucking...  I have an atomic kitchen, Ralph.  This place looks like a yucca flats after the blast. 
[00:49:00]  Great shit.  Let's take a break from the madness.  You tell Mr. Marshall I'll golf with him anytime?  He's a good friend of mine.  He's always like putting his foot in his mouth.  Always.  Ass.  And then one scene later, Ralph's good friends with Mr. Marshall.  Oh, boy.  No, he's not.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  That's unbelievable. 
[00:49:30]  The Opie and Anthony show, talking about Christmas tips.  Tits?  I love Christmas tips.  You'll decorate them up?  I don't mind giving Christmas tips.  I think I did this, we did this break last year.  Well, it's a yearly thing.  But it gets more involved this year.  My building, I live in Manhattan.  Jimmy's going through this too.  Right around late November, actually it starts in early November, the staff at your building 
[00:50:00]  that you live in, they start being really nice to you, going out of their way.  Do they?  Look you in the eye.  Hello, Mr. Hughes.  How was your day, Mr. Hughes?  Did you have a good day, Mr. Hughes?  I'm like, what the fuck's going on?  This was last year when I didn't know what the hell it was all about.  What the scam was.  And then late November, right after Thanksgiving, there's a packet that everyone receives.  Of all the people that work in the building, what they do so you could then tip them accordingly 
[00:50:30]  for Christmas.  What they do.  Oh, they let you know like...  Like this guy's a maintenance dude, this guy's actually the head of maintenance, this  guy's a concierge, this guy's a doorman, this guy's security, this guy's this and that  and that and that and that and that and that.  Last year, my Christmas tips for my building reached over $2,000, Anthony.  Wow.  $2,000.  That's insanity.  And I think the highest guy got maybe $100 and something. 
[00:51:00]  Jimmy's going through this too.  And I thought Christmas tips were like, oh, you know what, I remember a few guys in my  building that I kind of like and they really take care of me.  They went above and beyond.  And then you give them a little envelope like, hey, man, between you and I, thank you, happy  holidays, enjoy.  Yeah, yeah.  But now it's this involved thing with a pamphlet, with pictures and everything.  Well, now they hand out envelopes like it's expected.  But that's what I'm trying to say.  It's a shakedown.  It shouldn't be expected.  No, it shouldn't.  You should decide on your own if you want to tip the people that help you on a daily basis.  Who helps you and who doesn't? 
[00:51:30]  Half these people, I don't even fucking know, right?  Dude, half these people on my list, I've never seen before in the building, but you  feel obligated, you've got to give everyone a tip.  And then they have a big, huge tip box in the lobby of my building.  Yeah, a big tip box.  So now you can just...  Put that in Sloan Kettering.  Tip.  Okay, that was really bad.  You can put the envelope right into the box, so now you don't even, you know, because you're  not going to see half these people.  Yeah.  Can I just say the beauty of comedy is that Anthony just did a joke, and I can see he  didn't realize anyone... 
[00:52:00]  He just went, why did I say that?  Why did I say it?  I know.  Exactly.  I want to apologize.  You should do what I do, man.  Like, I don't tip.  What I do is I find a reason.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah.  From November on, to find fault with everybody and everything they do.  Why is this door not being held open?  It's my bathroom, and I'm alone.  Fire, everyone!  You know, we got assholes that live in our building that if the doorman's busy getting  someone a cab or something, they will not open the door themselves to go outside. 
[00:52:30]  They will actually wait right in front of the door until the doorman comes back to open  the door for them.  Right.  Oh, fucking cunts.  Oh, my God.  No, they're just fucking entitled assholes.  So, anyway, there's a garage that a bunch of us park in every morning, and a list was  just handed to Kenny, all the people that work at that garage, for Christmas tips. 
[00:53:00]  Yep.  For Christmas tips.  Do you tip them?  Just because you're a monthly parker at the garage, now you've got to tip everybody for  Christmas.  Do you tip them every time?  Who?  They get your car?  Yeah.  I don't.  See, I probably show them.  What, in my building?  Yes.  No.  Well, yeah, I do.  I give them like a dollar every time, two dollars every time, depending on the guys.  Some of the guys are cool.  No, I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about the work garage downstairs.  Kenny just got a pamphlet of names and faces of the guys that work at the garage, so they  could get their Christmas tip action. 
[00:53:30]  It's not a tip anymore, is what I'm saying.  Yeah, it becomes something different than a tip.  You know, if you want to tip somebody, it's great.  I like tipping.  I love tipping people when they do a great job.  They come in, they deliver shit, whatever they're fucking doing.  You know what?  And over the years, you know exactly who to tip, because they're taking care of you, they're  working hard, you have some kind of relationship with the guy.  You're like, oh, that guy, man.  Yeah, he's really good to me.  I'm going to make sure I give him a little something around the holidays.  You know what?  And that's how it started.  Here's what I don't get. 
[00:54:00]  Tipping the mailman.  The mailman expects you to tip him.  You tip him just for not killing his coworkers or putting anthrax on your notes.  All right, that's good.  And the garbage men expect a big tip on Long Island.  That's the thing.  There's privately owned garbage companies.  It's not like the city.  Sure.  And they expect you to give your garbage collector a tip.  Sure.  But it's like, that's...  Dude, I understand all that. 
[00:54:30]  That's the job.  You go out and you pick up the garbage.  I got 40 people in my building.  I got a tip now.  Why?  Why do I have to tip 40 people for living in a building?  Like, I would tip some of these guys just because it's the right thing to do.  See, I don't know.  Like, yes, I literally...  You have the same thing going on, right?  Oh, I do.  But I recognize, excuse me, most of them.  Like, I interact with most of them fairly often.  Maintenance guys?  You've never seen half those maintenance guys.  Honestly?  Really?  All of them. 
[00:55:00]  Like, when I see the garage guys, because I get my car every night to go down and work.  So I literally, I recognize 75% of them.  Oh, I recognize all the garage guys.  Sure.  The maintenance guys, the door guys.  I'm like, oh yeah, he did, oh yeah.  Any of them I would feel bad about sliding when I see all their pictures.  It might be one or two where I'll go, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I've seen it.  But most of them I see all the time.  No, you can't slide any of them now that there's a list.  You can't.  Now there's a list.  So, what?  There's a, Danny pulled up a whole thing of who you're supposed to tip and how much,  and the list is endless. 
[00:55:30]  What's the tip for, say, wait, let's go over this list real fast.  Concierge.  What do we got?  I'm pretty good with the tips.  Is this just basic living?  Yeah, pretty much.  For the average person, right?  Well, for average or.  Come across most of these people.  If you live in a building or.  All right, what do you got, Danny?  In a gardener's, things like that.  Let's rock this.  Babysitter, daycare, where do you want to start at?  Building, building people.  Well, you got an apartment doorman, and this, according to this tipping guide,  you should be tipping your doorman anywhere between $10 and $100.  Can they fucking be a little bit more vague? 
[00:56:00]  Or is this some kind of manors website or something?  Yeah.  It's a holiday super guy.  You're building superintendent.  How much?  $50 to $200.  Yeah, I usually give $200 to $250 to my super, but he's taking good care of me.  What does he do?  If I've ever had any problems, like when I wanted to buy a storage unit,  he went out of his way to help me.  Like, I like the guy, and I think he's good.  Well, that's personal good guy being a good guy shit.  Yeah.  Not just because he's the building superintendent, right?  No, I actually like the guy.  Here we go.  I had to buy my superintendent concert tickets. 
[00:56:30]  Because he knows what I do, and he's like, he asked about a show.  And I basically told him, look, I can't get those tickets.  I'm really sorry.  So he goes, well, all right.  Well, then how about Clapton?  So I asked Kenny.  I had to pull out about fucking $700 to get this guy two tickets to a show that I had no connections for.  What the fuck?  What kind of idiot is your super?  My super would never do that.  He goes, all right, well, I forgot what it was.  It was either for, like, the dead or somebody was coming around. 
[00:57:00]  And I couldn't get the tickets.  So he goes and names another show.  I'm like, I'm basically telling you I don't have connections to these shows you want.  I need some fucking tickets.  It's Brett Weir to Super Across the Way.  Right.  You get me your fucking tickets.  So then I felt like, holy shit, I'm being held up here.  I got to get him.  I got to get this guy tickets.  He runs the building.  I don't need to talk to you, jerky.  Let's say hi to Hank in Connecticut.  Hank.  Hank.  How you doing?  Hello, man's name.  Jesus, that's a fucking man. 
[00:57:30]  Hank.  Hank.  There's never a fruity guy named Hank.  Hank.  Who's punching you in the face?  Oh, that would be Hank.  What up, Hank?  Hey, I got home yesterday.  And yesterday was recycling day.  And on the bottom of my bin was a stapled note with a return address for the guy to send him a check for Christmas.  That's good.  Just leave it in there.  It's recyclable, right?  That's right.  It's paper.  I put it right back in the garbage.  It's paper.  How did that start?  I don't know.  Because, you know, back in the day, and we all like to say back in the day, 
[00:58:00]  you would just tip people that you felt, you know, were doing the right thing around you.  Can I send an envelope with my name on it and stuff just to, like, our bosses?  I want to send, like, I want to give, like, you know, Bladder and Scott and all the way up the top  and just go, because I come in here and do my job.  Are you feeling okay?  And do my job.  I would like, you know, a little gratuity, a little tip. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, I see.  Based on...  Oh, you want to give them the blank envelope.  Right.  See, so they...  Because, yeah, now I'm coming in here on a daily basis doing my job.  So then they should fill the envelope up with a little cash and give it to me.  I'd be happy if I put the envelope into those offices and I opened it and they had taken  a shit in the envelope.  I would say thank you so much for at least keeping it consistent with the way you view  me here.  I told you you would get...  I'm not even mad, but that's cool.  What would be really nice is this. 
[00:59:00]  You open the envelope, right, and there's a big steaming shit in it, but it's a musical  envelope, so it plays a sweet song.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da, we value you, we value you a lot.  And it's just...  It's full of shit.  Yeah, there's a big...  A log in the envelope.  I can go, thank you for the flowery word.  Let me eat this.  That's nice.  It's delicious.  Let me eat...  Lovely snack.  Let me spoon it out.  It's a mushy one.  Let's go to J.R. in Connecticut.  J.R.  Who shot you? 
[00:59:30]  What's up, boys?  What's up, J.R.?  Yes, I did.  Huh?  Sorry.  I said, happy birthday, Jimmy.  What do you got, J.R.?  All right, so I live in Connecticut, right?  And I lived in the same place for four years now.  The first two years, I didn't tip my garbage man, because, you know, I'm a younger guy.  I don't know if you tip your garbage man.  The first couple years, I'm living on my own.  He leaves my fucking garbage pants in the middle of the street.  Right away, you're fucking fresh.  The second year, or the third year, I give the guys two 20s in the envelope.  Yeah.  They still leave my garbage can in the middle of the street. 
[01:00:00]  Not enough, you cheap fuck.  I give them two 50s, and finally, I got to give this guy two 50s to get my garbage can  Yeah, but now, that's the point I'm making today.  Now, you feel like you're being held up.  You really do.  It's not a tip anymore.  It's like, this is what you have to do.  That's what it is.  How many names on your list, Kenny, for the work garage?  The work garage.  It's the garage we use on a daily basis.  You have to tip 13 guys, because you park your car every day downstairs.  Yeah, and then they put in bold letters who's the manager, the assistant manager, and the 
[01:00:30]  two foremen.  Now, don't you tip them every day when they bring the car?  Yes.  So, that's the tip, but that's the tip.  I tip them when I drop the cars off, and when we pick them up.  You tip, what, a dollar each, two dollars a day total?  Yeah, each vehicle.  Now, you would say, ah, two dollars a day, but how many days a year are you parking the  car?  That's a lot of fucking money extra.  Five days a week.  Five days a week, so that's ten dollars a week. 
[01:01:00]  Ten bucks a week.  And, you know.  Five hundred, twenty dollars a year.  Five hundred, twenty.  No, but I work hard, too, you know.  You guys.  Yeah.  You sure do.  You'll find a little something.  I didn't see no envelope from you, so go fuck yourself.  Yeah, exactly.  I didn't see a pamphlet with your picture on it that says big, stupid dope.  Exactly.  Oh.  You want a tip?  Do you open up, it's a box of conditioner in it?  Sorry, Kenny.  I always give Kenny a little something.  Yeah, and how many names on my list this year? 
[01:01:30]  I take a ten dollar bill, and I fold it over, and I go, a little something for you.  There you go.  Hey.  I just handed my pamphlet in to Kenny, because he's going to help me out with this.  You lucked out this year, GH.  There's one less name on the list.  How many names, though?  There's 36 building employees.  That I have to tip.  That I have to tip.  And nine garage employees.  Forty-five guys.  What the fuck?  Thank you.  Now you're involved with the bit.  That's insane.  It's the principle of that. 
[01:02:00]  Forty-five fucking guys.  Forty-five guys, I got to tip.  And you have to tip.  And each of them get anywhere between $25 up to $200.  Yeah, $25 is the lowest.  $25 is for guys you don't even know.  Holy toll.  I forget.  $25 for guys you don't even know.  Dude, the gym.  See, I use the gym in my building.  I'm like, you don't know by looking at me.  But I mean, I use it a lot, so I tip them, too.  I don't.  It doesn't.  The building tips are a little bit a lot.  Like, there's a lot of people.  But I don't mind. 
[01:02:30]  Forty-five guys, Jimmy.  There are people I interact with a lot, and they make my life a lot easier.  I honestly do.  I know the guys that I interact with a lot, and I have no problem tipping those guys.  None whatsoever.  So just tip those guys.  The guys that don't interact with you, they're going to get pissed at you, but fuck them because  they don't help you.  It's a whole pamphlet.  There's letters, and there's descriptions, and pictures, and everything.  Dossier?  Basically.  Dossier.  I like to spread it around.  It makes me look good.  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[01:03:00]  Easy come, easy go.  I love spending your guys' money.  I went with it.  Forty-five fucking guys, really?  Yeah.  Forty-five fucking guys.  That is a lot of people.  That is a lot of people right there.  That's a lot of people.  Well, what do I got?  I guess my mailman, the garbage man, the groundskeeper, and Keith.  An Ange.  Your pool guy?  Ah, you, well, hey.  Tip him.  He don't come around in the winter. 
[01:03:30]  Let's go to Stryker.  Good for that.  Stryker!  Thank God.  Stryker.  Love the show.  Hey.  Morning, boys.  Hi, Stryker.  Hey, I forgot, two years ago, I forgot to tip the guy that delivers, you know, my milk  man.  We get home delivery of our dairy stuff every week.  Sure.  Time machine.  Yeah, exactly.  Where are you living in?  What would you do, leave some oats for his horse?  What the fuck's wrong with you, Stryker?  What the fuck?  Go to the store.  Jesus Christ.  You know what year it is?  Yeah.  My father milks it right into my mouth about cereal. 
[01:04:00]  He holds cereal in his mouth, and the guy jerks an utter off into the other side of his  mouth.  How much do you tip your butter churner?  Exactly.  How about the other Amish people that help you put the wall up?  Go ahead.  Joke's over.  Go.  Anyhow, two years ago.  How much do you tip the guy that sells you the animal blood to write on the cave wall?  We'll go as far back in time as you want.  We'll go as far back, yes.  Yes.  How many rocks do you tip, Erica?  Sorry.  Boo.  Go ahead, you're off.  The guy that sells me the animal blood, I only tip him one rock. 
[01:04:30]  We got it.  Right.  You don't have to elaborate on it.  Let it go.  Anyhow, I forgot to tip the guy, and for the entire next year, my order was fucked up.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, at the end of the year, I got a Christmas card from him.  It's stuck in the box, and it's just a very subtle reminder to tip the milk man so my order  continues to be in good condition every year.  There you go.  Yeah, what a fucking douchebag.  Why didn't you just go to the store after that, and he started leaving, like, milk in 
[01:05:00]  condoms, and you're like, wait a minute.  Oh, fuck, yeah.  Well, but just, you know, I mean, this way I only have to go to the grocery store once  a month.  You know, I mean, that gets half my time.  That's your problem.  Hey, recluse, what do you do?  Yeah, how far do you live from a grocery store?  Agoraphobic?  Well, yeah, actually, I am.  I'm kind of like Anthony.  You know, I hate going out in public.  All right, how far do you live, though, from a supermarket?  I'll go to the liquor store, though.  About 10 miles.  10 lousy miles?  It's actually out of my way.  It's actually out of my way to go to the grocery store. 
[01:05:30]  He's got to hitch up the horses to the wagon.  Jesus.  Another problem.  Well, that was good.  They never get tiring.  I'm trying to think of one as we speak.  Of course.  Why wouldn't you?  What happens when you're on your way to the store?  Do you occasionally see a Negro selling jelly?  Hey, Tuma.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, honey.  He's selling honey.  How fucking, how?  When Red is dropping those honey jars, they sound like money down the toilet. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  Each one is just, oh, Tuma.  It's like money from home, sir.  Money from home, Joe Buck.  You got a way of saying things regular.  What do you tip the blacksmith, sir?  I don't remember.  It's a rhetorical question.  It's a joke that's well overstayed.  It's welcome.  No, it hasn't.  Blacksmiths do old jobs, too.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Joe in New York.  Joe.  Good morning.  How do you do, Joe?  What up, Joe? 
[01:06:30]  Opie, my question for you is, how many people live in your building?  So how many tips do these guys get?  It's just Opie is the problem.  Yes.  He has 45 servants.  Opie has serfs.  Serfs.  He's the lord of the manor.  Yes, he is.  He rings a little bell and eight people come in.  Like, they wash his penis like in fucking Coming to America.  There's one who leaves rose petals in front of him behind him.  He hates to tip the rose petal girls.  That is a good question, though. 
[01:07:00]  There's got to be at least 200 apartments, I would imagine.  There's close to 50 floors, and some floors have one apartment, but others have at least  four to six.  So there's got to be 200 households.  You know, Kenny?  There's over three.  Over 300?  Yeah.  Because I saw there's a petition list about, you know, that construction that's going  on in the street.  Oh, is that annoying, too?  The same thing, but it may fucking annoy you.  Yeah?  What? 
[01:07:30]  No, no, no.  They just want to do something with the roads.  It's going to make traffic a lot more.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, because we got a little, uh...  We got it easy right now.  We got a little quiet spot.  That's going to be about to go away.  Oh, and they're going to put a big, major fucking thoroughfare through there?  Through our living room.  Oh, that's nice.  It goes through my...  I'm on the 10th floor.  It goes right through.  And you have to tip every driver that drives through your house.  No, basically, you just have to...  It's like a big...  It's going to hurt the apartment value, because they're going to just drive right through,  and you have to wait to cross to go take a shit.  I'm like, it's going to be cold in here, but they're like, yeah, but you get to meet people. 
[01:08:00]  You get to meet people?  Yeah.  All right.  They're fucking around with your neighborhood, huh?  Well, they want to put lights in and all sorts of shit.  Yeah.  Who knows?  Whatever.  By a highway, huh?  Speaking of the holidays, this story is the story of the day.  A holiday story?  The neo-Nazis.  What about them?  On Sherman Green in Fairfield, a menorah lighting brought out around 20 people in the rain,  and also brought out three men to protest with Nazi flags. 
[01:08:30]  Was it a hate crime?  What the fuck, man?  What the fuck, man?  Three guys just got nothing better to do than wave a Nazi flag at a menorah lighting?  What the fuck?  Best with Nazi flags.  Was it a hate crime?  And their manners and their masks and their behavior clearly exhibits that hatred,  and we are certainly taking it seriously, and we are investigating it.  The three men wearing masks standing on a nearby sidewalk unfurled the flags showing the Iron 
[01:09:00]  Cross, the SS, and Nazi insignias, and shouted obscenities.  Fairfield's first selectman, Kenneth Flato, says he heard parts of what was shouted.  But I did hear enough to hear the F word.  I did hear enough to hear the word Jewish.  Here's my problem.  The J word.  Why are those little faggots wearing masks?  That's the problem.  It's like, you want to stand there and hold a Nazi sign and a bunch of Jews?  Fucking, you bet, why wouldn't you just stand there like a fucking man with your face showing? 
[01:09:30]  Hey, the Klan wore masks.  Exactly.  They're despicable pussies.  They knew that it would ruin their standing in the community.  How?  Everybody back then was awful.  That's a good point.  Just that fucking hide-their-face cowardice.  I hate it.  They have to hide their face because they're a group that is not really accepted, Jimmy.  And if they were on camera, perhaps their families and livelihood may suffer.  So these are men that have that much conviction in their beliefs. 
[01:10:00]  But there's not enough conviction to go, yes, this is who I am.  This is what I stand for.  So basically, they're not really men who have conviction.  They're just, they're kind of cowardly.  Look, Nazi gotta eat, motherfucker.  Fair point.  Nazi gotta eat.  Fair point.  Jesus.  Why do you fold so easily?  What do you mean?  You just folded.  No, no, no.  You're thinking like a Jew.  What I'm trying to say.  That makes me fucking...  Fair point.  And I understand you have the right to peacefully protest.  You really do.  But when you do that in front of a synagogue, they literally, I would love it if somebody 
[01:10:30]  just fucking pulled out a weapon.  That is a bit of a sore spot with Jewish people, by the way.  Yeah.  Swastikas.  Jews are too nice, dude.  And they're lighting a menorah and having that is perhaps some bad timing.  If you want to, you know, if you want to march and demonstrate and have some kind of  a thing that you're international socialism and stuff, do it.  But you don't have to do it in, like, you know, a neighborhood where they're lighting 
[01:11:00]  a menorah.  Just pick it.  Get yourself a permit.  March around.  Rah, rah, rah.  Heil Hitler.  All that stuff.  And then, uh, go home.  No, don't do it passively there.  Do it in Brownsville.  Do it in East New York.  Put on your fucking little clan hoods.  And don't tell the police you're coming so you get protected.  Go there and march.  Like the shitty Westboro Church.  Just show up and march.  Allow the fucking people to react to your marching.  Well, then I would like to see, uh, in turn, uh, maybe the, the newly, uh, reorganized Black 
[01:11:30]  Panthers, uh, march in a nice white Southern town.  I think, uh, without any, any, um, shenanigans by the police.  Uh, I, I don't, I think that they absolutely would.  I really do.  Because the Black Panthers, I'm not saying, they, they haven't been an organization.  I know they've done some fucked up stuff.  No.  But they're not.  Fucked up stuff.  Blowing up police stations and cars.  I'm not saying that they're, they're not, they've been all law abiding.  But to me, they're not a group of cowards who have hidden their faces and targeted civilian  families for living in their neighborhoods. 
[01:12:00]  Well, they don't have to because they are not chastised for their beliefs.  Look, I am not defending the National Socialist Party here.  What I am saying is there is a double standard, uh, when it comes to people's freedoms to  express, uh, their, uh, political beliefs and stuff.  It's, it's supposed to be an open and free nation where people can express themselves.  And you hear it all the time from the ACLU that, that, uh, people do have the right to,  to, uh, demonstrate in, in, uh, ways and with, with, uh, situations that people hate. 
[01:12:30]  And that is one of them.  And the Nazi organization, people do not like Nazi organization.  Um, uh, but they do have the right to march, uh, peaceably, uh, peacefully and, and not  be harassed.  I agree.  It's like any other group.  I agree.  It is much.  And to me, the ACLU would defend them, which is something I like about the ACLU is they will  defend repulsive organizations like that.  And they should, but if you want that freedom, you should be able to at least be, uh, you 
[01:13:00]  should have to show your face.  There's something about it.  If you want to go out there and do something that is that purposefully confrontational.  Yeah.  Again, your belief should absolutely be heard and you should be allowed to do so freely,  but to be able to do so and then just go home without any, any type, why would you have  that type of a thing?  If you have the desire to do it, uh, publicly, why would you have to hide your face?  These are just, why?  These are absolutely three jackasses that are just trying to throw up a monkey wrench.  Black Panthers don't really hide their face when they're marching.  But they don't have to, they are accepted as a legitimate black organization and, and color 
[01:13:30]  makes a difference in this situation.  You could look at a Black Panther marching.  He will look right into the camera, black pride, uh, uh, speak, uh, uh, uh, hatred for  the white man and, um, everything's fine.  He's not going to, you know, lose his job.  Uh, and, and it's accepted because he is that downtrodden guy.  He's the, you know, trying to bring pride to his, his race and everything.  It's not, it's not looked at negatively, even though their beliefs, um, are not much 
[01:14:00]  different than the KKK or, uh, the Nazi party separation between the races, hatred of the  other races, and, um, uh, ultimately wanting superiority of their race.  It's not much different.  The difference is they are more accepted through political correctness than, uh, the national  socialist or the Ku Klux Klan.  When you look at the, yeah, but when you look at the way the police came down on them,  and I'm not even saying that they didn't deserve it sometimes, but the Black Panthers were 
[01:14:30]  not hailed and loved by society.  They really weren't.  No, especially back in the, in the, uh, 60s and 70s.  Right, right.  What they were doing was socially relevant.  It was terroristic.  It was.  What they were doing.  Some of it was.  They were blowing up state buildings, um, uh, police departments, police cars, targeting  authority, that is, uh, uh, domestic terrorism that they were committing back then.  Now, you look at, obviously, the Nazi party, uh, committed a few atrocities of their own.  And the Nazis, the, the, the cowardice of, of, of, of what they were doing and the Klan 
[01:15:00]  is doing is they're fucking hiding their faces and they're targeting civilians.  They're, they're, they're not, I'm not saying the Panthers are right to target police.  I'm fucking pro-cop.  But at least they're going after guys with guns.  They're not going after fucking a guy and his wife who move into a house and then fucking,  and setting the porch on fire.  Oh, what's more dangerous, though?  A gun or, you know what I'm saying?  They're just despicable.  We got someone that, uh, disagrees with that.  Scott in Jersey.  Scott.  Scott.  Good morning, boys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy. 
[01:15:30]  Hey, buddy.  Hello, Mr. Bernstein.  Um, Anthony.  Yes, sir.  I love you, but every time you, you're starting with your, your Nazi, quote, unquote, defending  Nazis and defending this kind of stuff, you make my blood boil.  All right.  There's a, there's a big difference between freedom of speech and freedom of hate speech.  And hate speech is the kind of stuff that, uh, Jimmy, you mentioned the Westboro Church.  They're actually protesting in front of a school today.  Do you know hate speech is absolutely protected under the First Amendment? 
[01:16:00]  He's right, bro.  It is.  It's absolutely protected.  You cannot incite a riot with your speech, um, but you, you can, you can voice your opinion  politically, religiously.  You're allowed to do that.  That's what the First Amendment grants you.  Because hate speech, what is considered hate speech is, it's, it's a transient thing.  It's figurative.  It's, it's, it's fucking like, it might be hate speech to one person, it's not to another.  Right.  What we do on this show on a daily basis, and I don't mean what I'm talking about right 
[01:16:30]  now, but just jokes that we tell is considered hate speech to some people.  By some people, yeah.  Hate speech is, uh, is an opinion based on what someone's saying.  I, I actually, I agree with Anne on that completely.  Don't think, and don't just jump on me about defending the Nazis.  What I am doing is defending any group that is, uh, uh, despicable and, and, um, but, but  not treated as fairly as other despicable groups.  That's what I'm saying.  Right.  I understand that. 
[01:17:00]  I understand the double standard, and I agree with that part.  But it's just when, when you see a group like the Westboro Church, like the Nazis, like,  okay, Nazis, get over yourselves.  You had your time, you're done.  We don't like people.  They're has-beens?  Are you saying they're has-beens?  Yeah, basically, yeah, they're not their has-beens.  It's just when, when you get groups that are preaching not pride in your own heritage,  not, you know, or, you know, okay, fine, the, the clan does that to an extent, but when 
[01:17:30]  you're preaching, basically, we don't like you, we want you to die, that's hate speech,  and that goes a little bit further than what, than I feel, than what is protected.  Honestly, dude, no.  I hate to tell you, it doesn't.  Even though what you're saying, like, morally, it bothers you, or it's offensive, as much  as I despise the Westboro Church, and I really do, I, I mean, I wish that something would  happen to them, whatever it is, I wish they'd all get cancer, but they are, in a way, their  ability to be such pigs, or what I see as being such pigs publicly, is what makes our 
[01:18:00]  country great.  It's like, they are allowed to say that.  I mean, I think, look, should you be allowed to do it in a soldier's funeral?  Yeah, I, I think there's got to be a way, there's got to be some kind of common sense  balance, but you can't stop people from saying hateful things, dude, you can't, because that's,  that's dangerous.  Yeah, and I understand that, but Jimmy, Jimmy, you were very smart in, in bringing up, um,  you know, let him, let him do that without the police protection, let him do that without  the masks on, let him do that in the kind of areas where it would really provoke a real 
[01:18:30]  reaction, um, and see, and see how, you know, how public safety, see the second, the, you  know, maybe these groups, if they don't start getting this kind of protection that's, you  know, afforded to them under the Constitution, which I don't particularly agree with, let's  see them, you know, have a little bit of second thought, like, you know what, maybe we shouldn't  do this, because we're not going to have the kind of protection that's kind of afforded  to us, and people are going to, you know, basically, which, again, it sucks, but. 
[01:19:00]  He's throwing away a right.  No, dude, honestly, bro, bro, it's not what I'm saying, I don't mean that, I, I really,  I know it's like, it's hard, it's a really weird line, that, that, those three Nazi guys  that did that, they should have the right to make that kind of a statement, even though  it's despicable.  My problem with them is that they do it without showing their faces.  But the right to do it should not, then, have this consequence of destroying your life  because, only because of what you're speaking about. 
[01:19:30]  Now, other groups can preach hate all they want, and it does not destroy their life and  livelihood.  There is a stigma on certain groups, whether it's, whether it's legitimate stigma or not,  but there is a stigma on certain groups, and they, other groups get preferential treatment  over some other groups.  It's just, it's just the way it is.  Well, Black Panthers were, were definitely targeted.  They were absolutely targeted.  Yes, of course they were.  And, if, if, if you're that passionate, if you have that much conviction in your belief 
[01:20:00]  that you want to go out and bother a bunch of Jews who are lighting a menorah, and you  want to go out and, and remind them that their ancestors, their, their fucking grandparents,  that's stupid, but, but if you want to go out and remind people that their grandparents  were fucking slaughtered and put in an oven, uh, then you should have to show your face.  It would be stupid of them to show their face.  But why, it would be stupid of them.  But why not, again, they have the right, number one, protected right, why wouldn't they,  if you have that much conviction, why all of a sudden are you worried what's going to 
[01:20:30]  happen at your job?  If, if you're that convicted that you're going to go out on, in the middle of the night  and show these Jews a fucking swastika, well then you defend yourself at your job.  You really want to stand up for your, everything I say, everything I say, I say with my face  and my real name, everything.  And I don't say anything that radical, but I always use my face and my real name.  So do you, so does Opie, we all do.  So I have no respect for anybody that has to hide behind a fucking mask and say what  they want publicly. 
[01:21:00]  Well, you've taken the time to do it right.  They're not attacking the Jews.  They're respecting and obeying the law to a certain degree.  Show your faces.  Let's talk to one of the guys in the masks then.  Uh, Steve from Bayshore.  Yeah, no kidding.  Uh, what were you thinking when, let's go to Kurt in the Bronx.  Kurt, what do you got on this?  Yeah, Anthony, you talked about double standard.  There was a double standard in this country for how many hundreds of years?  It's only like 20 years where black people are kind of treated equally.  And even then you still hear constantly of issues where, oh, black, white couples can't  get married.  All right, so let me, so let me, let me add this. 
[01:21:30]  Let me just cover that because you said it and I'll, I'll, I'll answer that.  So the freedom of speech, the first amendment of the constitution, the freedom of speech  is based on and can be altered due to what happened to certain people.  So certain people have to get like makeup, uh, makeup rights.  They have to have their rights the first way out of the country.  That's what you're saying.  You're saying for 200 years.  You said some groups get preferential treatment.  Yes.  Are you talking about black people getting preferential treatment in this country? 
[01:22:00]  I'm saying in this country, a black group can march in this country with impunity, whereas  a Nazi group cannot.  I have to disagree.  Absolutely.  Here's why I disagree.  The whole idea behind a Nazi group was killing Jewish people.  The whole idea behind black people, black groups is not killing us.  Go to Times Square.  Go to Times Square.  You will see blacks standing on fucking podiums saying that the white devil should be killed.  The Nazi group is based on killing Jewish people. 
[01:22:30]  Would you, would you listen?  No, you know something?  There are actually national socialists that are just into white pride, not into a killing,  they're into separatism, but not into killing.  And yes, there's Holocaust denial.  There's all that stuff.  But I'm just saying what you're not understanding is you're getting the, you're getting me totally  wrong here.  I am saying there is a double standard on who gets First Amendment protection and who  has to cover their face because of consequences. 
[01:23:00]  That I have to disagree with because the way, hold on, bro, bro, sir, hold on, Kurt, hold  on, hold on, Kurt, hold on.  I disagree with that only because when you look at the Westboro Church, and again, I find  them repugnant.  Yeah.  They are doing, what they're doing on a level to Americans as far as the way they're protesting,  I feel is even more offensive than what the Nazis do, what this, I mean, they're purposefully  antagonizing the family of dead soldiers.  Right, right.  And they don't hide their faces.  This is who they are. 
[01:23:30]  They stand out there.  They say what they want.  And you know what?  Their free speech is protected.  The entire country finds them repulsive and their free speech is protected.  They're allowed to march.  So they're not, there's no preferential treatment.  And they are allowed to say that stuff freely with their faces being shown.  Do you understand what I mean?  I hate them, but at least they show their faces.  I understand what you're saying.  It's, it's, you know what that is too?  It's so outrageous and so ridiculous that, like, people hate them. 
[01:24:00]  Believe me, people want them dead.  People want to kill them.  They want to kill them.  But it's so out there that they're almost ignored.  They're almost ignored.  Not by, no, not by a soldier's family.  Not by a soldier's family.  No, absolutely not.  Dude, they stood outside of Arlington National, Bush, or while passed an executive order or  something, someone could probably correct me, where he wanted to make it illegal to protest  within X amount of feet of a soldier's funeral. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  Like, that's how repulsive what they were doing has been perceived by other Americans.  It's like, it's offensive to all of us on a really weird level.  I have, I have to make a point, though, to this gentleman here.  Uh, we live in New York City here, sir.  Uh, you're, you're in the Bronx.  Now you've, you've walked, you've walked through Times Square, haven't you?  Have you, have you seen these, um, uh, the, the black Israelites?  They stand, okay.  They stand on podiums, uh, and preach nothing but death to white people, black supremacy, 
[01:25:00]  how they were the original, uh, tribe of Israel, and, uh, they, they demean and, and, uh, threaten  white people as they walk by.  Now, now, hold the phone!  Let me fucking finish for a minute.  Okay.  They are allowed to stand there and do that.  For a second, if three people were in Nazi uniforms, preaching white supremacy, they  would be taken off the fucking street. 
[01:25:30]  Double standard.  They're a little bit more of a track record of actually killing you.  Fuck you!  I'm not talking about a track record.  I'm talking about, fuck the track record.  It shouldn't affect freedom of speech.  They executed their actions.  But, uh, wouldn't they hold up?  Holy shit!  There's, there's freedom of speech, period!  It's not, it's not freedom of speech based on what someone did 50 years ago or 200 fucking  years ago.  Would the Nazis be taken off the street?  Yes!  Immediately!  Because I've watched those black Israelites.  They leave them the fuck alone! 
[01:26:00]  Because I honestly...  People get to speak out there all the time!  Bullshit!  I'd love to see someone in an SS uniform preaching, uh, uh, uh, anti-Semitism and hatred and,  and watch him fucking stand on the street.  And not be pelted also by everybody.  They're afraid of these black guys, is what it is.  I honestly, dude, if part of me, I've...  I've watched the groups, you're saying what they say, and all the parts of the country.  All right.  I've actually stood there and watched those guys.  Yeah.  And I, I don't, those black Israelites, I think what they say is really irritating.  Believe it, I've watched them.  I used to work at MTV.  They are nasty, violent, ignorant motherfuckers. 
[01:26:30]  But in all honesty, standing out there watching them, as much as I said, ah, Reed!  Reed!  They, they never said anything like, do something to this guy, or to the, I'm telling you, I've  watched them do...  Are you shitting me?  Dude, I've never experienced that.  I've seen videos of these motherfuckers preaching nothing but white hatred.  Hatred for the white people.  Meaning...  How, how they will take over.  How they will take over.  Oh, why, that's too vague.  They can say that.  They mean eliminate the white race.  I mean, as a guy standing there, like, you're saying that they'll, they'll, like, threaten 
[01:27:00]  people, like, they've never said anything that went beyond what should be protected.  I'll bet you that the Nazis, if they got the right permits, because those guys, believe  me, you think the cops like those scumbags?  No.  The cops probably want to rouse them, but they obviously have a permit to be there, so if  the Nazis got a permit...  They would not, first of all, they would not be granted a permit, because just having  a Nazi in Times Square would, they would consider that inciting, and, and not allow them to  even stand there and preach hatred.  I don't, I think you're wrong, because they allow the Klan to march. 
[01:27:30]  When they fight in court, the Klan is allowed to march.  Yeah, after months of court battles, they allow them to march.  Absolutely.  They would, they would consider it inciting.  They, they, and they wouldn't be standing there just peacefully holding their flags or  whatever.  They would be, I, I, they'd be standing and preaching hatred, and, and that's exactly what  these black Israelites are doing, but there's a huge double standard.  In all honesty, I don't think, and I, and I know this, there's no double, I, I think the  Nazis would be permitted.  I don't think you'd find a lot of Nazis that would be willing to do that.  People would react harsher to them. 
[01:28:00]  This is where track record matters.  Why don't these fucking black Israelites get shit thrown at them?  Honestly?  Because white people are afraid of them.  Oh, true, but it doesn't matter, because their track record is irrelevant.  Like, when I see the black Israelites, what they say is irritating, but I have no feeling  for what they say, like, they did this.  I don't give a fuck about them.  But when you look at Nazis, the track record is barbaric.  Track record, schmack record, Jimmy.  They're equally protected.  But I'm saying white people would react violently towards Nazis or Klan. 
[01:28:30]  It's, it goes, I think, a little bit beyond just white people being afraid of black people.  I don't, I don't think that these black Israelites incite rage in people other than what they're  saying.  You don't look back at what they've done and go, these fucking pieces of garbage.  That's to me is part of the reason that they don't get pelted.  Believe me, 10,000 white people in central, in the middle of New York could beat up fucking  10 Israelites.  They would never, they wouldn't throw anything at them.  They, they sometimes pass by and think they're brave by saying, oh, you, I've seen it. 
[01:29:00]  I've seen every video clip of them I've seen.  Believe me.  You get people heated enough in a fucking, in a back and forth.  Let me tell you, you've watched these anti and pro-abortion debates and political, people  get fucking disgusting with each other when they're angry enough.  Why are people just walking by?  My, my whole thing though is there is a double standard on the first amendment.  And that's how this whole thing got started.  Cause I know people are going to be like, oh, look at Anthony, the Nazi.  I'm just saying there's a double standard on the first amendment.  But I think that they have the right to do that.  Cause again, the Klan does march. 
[01:29:30]  The Klan doesn't, they don't want to come here and march.  Oh, no.  Like that's the problem.  They want to march in small Southern towns and occasionally they'll fight for New York  and come to New York.  And I'm not saying the Nazis wouldn't do it, but the black Israelites are not exactly  given spots in parades either.  They're not given a spot in the Irish day parade.  They wouldn't even let the fucking gays march in the parade.  So a lot of groups are kind of pushed out.  And how does, how does Reverend Al get a march together in a matter of days with appropriate 
[01:30:00]  permits to, to march with a lot of people and yet other organizations cannot do that  completely based on their beliefs?  I think because Reverend Al is a guy that could get people without a permit just to come here  in March anyway, the Klan can't, you're not going to get without that police protection.  Let, let's get 50 white guys to walk through fucking Brownsville without a police permit.  Let's see you do it.  They're not going to come Sharpton. 
[01:30:30]  You don't want to give him a permit.  You have to be accurate.  He will take those people and March through Howard beach and March through they, but they'll  do it without a police permit.  You're not going to get 50 fucking Nazis up here to March in Brownsville without a police  permit.  You're not going to get it.  So the police permit is probably to keep order with Sharpton.  The Nazis, you have to have it or they won't come.  And why won't the people in Howard beach do anything?  Uh, when Reverend Al would March in Howard beach fear, fear, dude, the people in Howard  beach.  I don't say that they get stabbed in Howard beach. 
[01:31:00]  I don't think that they wouldn't.  I think it was our beach.  It might've been, uh, so I'm sorry.  No, it was, it was somewhere, but they might be afraid the residents are going to hurt  them.  Those are not fucking, those are not frightened white people in Howard beach.  That's a good point.  Do you know what I mean?  Let's go.  The phones are lit.  John on long Island.  What do you got on this?  Make it quick.  Yeah.  Hey, uh, just happy holidays guys.  And Anthony, thank God for you being the voice of reason.  Yeah.  I'm not, I'm not in support of the KKK.  First of all, the hood is part of the intimidation. 
[01:31:30]  Okay.  That's part of the uniform.  That's number one.  It's part of the uniform.  Have some pride.  Hey, yeah.  And let me make a point here.  You know, the second point here too, when this society, we allow, listen, I'm not too  far from Bayshore.  Anthony's from the island too.  We have a lot of Hispanic gangs here.  A lot of these Hispanic gangs walk around with their gang colors.  You know who they are.  Yeah.  But we, society says it's okay to walk around with your gang colors, which is essentially  a uniform, which is essentially a means of intimidating people.  Well, you just said it, sir.  You just said it. 
[01:32:00]  You just said it.  They walk around with their gang colors.  Whatever that gang is, when you look at the Crips, the Bloods, you're right.  You see a guy in blue, you know he's a Crip.  You see a guy in red, you know he's a Blood.  They walk around like that.  The Klan, a lot of these groups want to make these fucking speeches with their face covered  and then not let you know who they are.  You just made my point.  A lot of them do, though.  Yeah, but listen, again, Anthony and Norton, that's part of the uniform.  It's part of intimidation. 
[01:32:30]  How different is it than when, I mean, you've seen just through ancient societies with like  the Arabs wearing hoods or I want to call it a Berber around their face to hide the ninjas.  Let's take ninjas.  The same thing is part of intimidation.  And there is preferential treatment given to other groups.  That's just not true.  Depending on the group and what their beliefs are, there is a difference in how they're  treated as far as the First Amendment goes. 
[01:33:00]  It's just the way it fucking is.  The Klan is allowed to march.  I find them repulsive because they hide their faces.  But, dude, the First Amendment doesn't say they can't wear their masks.  I just find them repulsive.  There's a difference in how long it takes to get a permit.  It's months in court, months in court for an organization like the KKK or the National Socialists to get a permit to march.  Meanwhile, if someone wants to put together an Obama rally or a Reverend Al wants to march, it's within days or there would be outrage. 
[01:33:30]  Because Sharpton would march without one.  And I'm not saying that's right.  The Klan won't come up here and just take the bull by the horns and march without one.  So for that reason alone, Bloomberg hands out permits to Reverend Al and any other organization that wants to march like that?  And meanwhile, it takes months of a court battle for a group that people despise, can't stand, and don't agree with their beliefs?  And that's the sole reason the permit's handed out? 
[01:34:00]  No, I can't defend Sharpton either.  I honestly don't know what the process is for him to get one for other people.  But he's been denied permits before.  Oh, yeah.  I'm not saying he hasn't been denied.  And so has Farrakhan.  Sure.  They've all been denied permits before.  Yes.  But I don't think there's preferential treatment.  I just think that the fucking bottom line is the Klan won't come up here.  They don't get a million Nazi march.  You think you'd be able to have that in Washington?  You wouldn't get a million Nazis.  I know.  Exactly.  Figuratively speaking, though.  Million Nazi march.  Nazis from around the world want to come to Washington and speak by the Washington Monument and by the Reflecting Pool and just have a million Nazis there. 
[01:34:30]  Do you honestly think a permit would be granted?  There would be utter outrage if a permit was even fucking considered.  You're right.  And there was a point raised that that would be...  Look, the Nazis, the bottom line, were a military organization.  It might be a little bit different.  No, they weren't.  No?  National socialism is political.  Nazis were not military.  Nazis, you know, they had a hell of an army backing them up. 
[01:35:00]  But technically, the National Socialism is a political movement.  And legally, I honestly don't know what would happen if they fought for that permit.  I don't know what...  Maybe they would get it.  Guarantee that it would be fought.  But maybe ultimately a court would give it to them.  We can't...  A court may give it to them because...  May, under a lot of pressure.  I'm not sure.  I'm just...  And again, the bottom line here with what I'm saying is First Amendment double standard.  I don't think there is, though.  I think that they all get the shot because the Klan marches.  These groups march. 
[01:35:30]  They really do.  You see the Klan marching.  They're not denied permits.  The ACLU fights for them.  Jimmy, wouldn't you get pissed if there was something you wanted to do?  And there's another person that wants to do the same thing.  You watch the other person.  Something as simple as motor vehicles.  Let's say you're online at motor vehicle.  And someone is behind you.  And you're there for the same thing.  They bring them up first.  They cut you.  And go, what do you need?  And it's taken care of in a minute. 
[01:36:00]  Now, you go up for the same thing.  And it's just...  You're standing there forever.  Wouldn't you get a little annoyed?  Absolutely.  But let's just say you're the guy that has been at motor vehicle.  And history has shown you behave despicably whenever you're at motor vehicle.  And you shit on the floor.  And you scream at people.  And you still want to be protected when everybody else wants to beat the shit out of you.  But if the fucking employees were told, no matter how he fucking treats you, you treat him exactly the same as you treat the other guy that treats you nicely. 
[01:36:30]  Because that is his right.  Then there's a different story.  Then it's the person behind the counter who's at fault, not the person in front.  Maybe.  I just don't agree that permits aren't given.  They are given to the Klan.  They are.  I know.  But again, much bigger battle than with other groups.  But I don't know.  I don't know what process the fucking Panthers go through.  You always hear about it.  You always hear that wherever they want to march, there's giant outcry.  There's political posturing.  There's permit denials.  Injunctions.  Everything to keep them from fucking marching in some town. 
[01:37:00]  And most of the time, I'll tell you, when they do keep putting up the fight, they do get to march.  And ten fucking idiots stand out there doing the Sig Heil with a fucking uniform on.  And they're outnumbered by the police, by the people that hate them, by everything else.  But just to get the permit took a long time.  Okay, so maybe certain groups do have a harder time or do have to fight harder for that First Amendment right.  But there are groups who go beyond being unpopular because the Westboro Church, how do they get permits everywhere? 
[01:37:30]  How do they get permits constantly outside of soldiers' funerals?  They always seem to get one relatively quickly.  I don't know what battle they have to go through, but how do they know when a soldier's going to die?  It's because they're all lawyers.  But do you understand?  It's like you're talking about unpopular groups not getting permits and having to fight.  The Westboro Church, let me tell you something.  They inspire more outrage than the Klan, the Black Panthers, any group.  And yet a soldier dies.  There's not a long period of time between a soldier getting killed and his funeral. 
[01:38:00]  And yet they find a way to get a permit within a couple of weeks.  How do they do it?  Yeah, they probably figured it out with all their lawyers and know exactly what to do.  And other groups are stupid, I guess.  But that does prove that you want to talk about ideologies.  That's the most reprehensible ideology.  And they get fucking permits, man.  They get them quick.  Probably faster than Sharpton.  I think publicity-wise, though, they amount to, like, you know, I'll use the Zebra Zeppelin thing, you know.  They're Zebra.  Nazis are Zeppelin. 
[01:38:30]  It's just more, it's a lot more in your face.  And it's, you know something?  It's a news grabber.  It's much more of a news grabber when Nazis want to march somewhere.  So, let's get to part two of the story here, by the way.  We only got half the stories there.  A story started this?  I had no idea.  With the obscenities and the ugly display, 911 was called.  But when police arrived, the three men got into their vehicle and drove off.  Of course they did.  Someone must have got...  Well, men. 
[01:39:00]  Of course they did.  Be on the lookout for a half-track driving down the road.  It's a Panzer tank that just left the scene.  Where'd they go?  The cops were there.  Where'd they go?  They pussied out and left.  Why?  Because they don't feel strongly enough about their convictions.  Exactly.  Three faggots want to stand there with a fucking...  With hateful shit for Jews.  And again, not hateful shit like we disagree with you politically.  The fucking Nazis.  Come on.  I'm sure these three were complete idiots. 
[01:39:30]  Decided on a whim they're going to fucking, you know, drink a little.  And show Nazi flags to Jews that are trying to light their menorah candles.  Despicable.  Real brave.  Real brave.  They showed up without a permit.  So let's see the balls they have to show up in Bedford-Stuyvesant the same way.  No permit.  And when the cops come, let's see how long those little fucking faggots last.  Let's see them do it.  Their flag-draped coffins would be...  They would use their flags over their coffins.  But do you understand what I'm saying?  They're cowards because they show up where they know it's pacifist. 
[01:40:00]  Or it's a group that's not going...  They're not going to be penalized for their actions.  Do you think there are different levels of a group like the Klan or National Socialists  that some are completely apprehensible and do things like that?  And others that are trying...  Reprehensible?  Reprehensible.  I'm sorry.  Apprehensible.  Reprehensible.  And others that are trying to maybe get some type of political foothold like a David Duke  who, you know, says, yeah, in my early days I was a grand wizard of the KKK. 
[01:40:30]  Now he believes in, you know, separatism and whatnot.  Yes.  But in much more of an acceptable political way.  Yes.  So, but I think he would still have trouble getting an organization together and a permit.  Maybe, but he was an elected official, man.  I don't think David Duke...  No, that's true.  ...would have as much...  I mean, he was allowed into the government.  I mean, as much as people despised the organization he was a member of, the vote came in, he won,  and he was allowed to serve. 
[01:41:00]  I mean, they didn't stop him from serving.  Good print.  Good print.  Here's more of the story.  Their vehicle and drove off.  Someone must have gotten a plate number because police say the three men are between 20 and 25 years old  and are not from Fairfield.  H-I-T-L-O-M.  Police are investigating whether a hate crime was committed.  The organizer of the Menorah Lighting says he hopes the message of Hanukkah will reach the three misguided men.  The message of Hanukkah is that a little bit of light can dispel a whole lot of darkness. 
[01:41:30]  I don't think it'll reach them, to tell you the truth.  I don't think they're going to be, you know, turned around by...  The three guys who saw American History X and wanted to play...  Exactly.  ...wanted to play go for bad.  You're absolutely right.  And you know what?  There are Klansmen, and I'll say this, that will march, or white supremacists, that will march anywhere.  Oh, uncovered.  And they will show their faith.  And I find them...  Their beliefs, I think, are gross.  But you know what?  They're guys who are going out there and marching, and they should be allowed to.  I don't say that they shouldn't be permitted to fucking march as much as anybody else. 
[01:42:00]  You got that right here.  Let's go to Mike in Albany.  Mike!  Mike!  Hey, Ant, there's a slight difference between a Nazi rally and an Obama rally.  Don't you kind of agree?  There's no difference between their right to express themselves and to have a permit and  gather and speak their beliefs.  No, there isn't a difference.  And let's put it this way.  You're talking about it taking months for them to get... 
[01:42:30]  Because they get stonewalled and everything.  It takes them months to get their thing.  Mm-hmm.  You had to pay...  You could have paid your ex-wife a payment early, right?  I can't speak about things, but go ahead.  No, you could...  Hypothetically, you probably could have given her a check for the total amount before...  Maybe.  ...and not extended and drawn out the payment as long as you did.  Yeah.  That you're given a certain amount of time to do something.  You can do it either real quick or you can wait until the last minute to do it. 
[01:43:00]  Are you equating that with the court system as far as how they grant a permit?  Yeah.  It has nothing to do with a right.  I'm talking about rights.  My God.  Everyone's confusing this with me defending Nazism.  I'm defending the First Amendment right of people to express themselves.  That's all.  All right.  Let's go to Joe in Virginia.  Joe.  Hey, boys. 
[01:43:30]  How you doing?  Hey, Joe.  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to give you a call.  I live in Virginia now.  I used to live in New York, and things are a little bit different down here.  The Klan does march in certain areas.  They actually protest in front of court buildings.  Yeah.  And, Anthony, you'd love it down here because there is a free carry law.  You're allowed to carry a weapon in the open, and you don't need a permit.  I don't like open carry, to tell you the truth.  Well, some of the black protests...  They're asking for trouble.  They've actually carried open weapons out there, and I figure that if the Klan ever 
[01:44:00]  did that one of their protests, they'd probably be locked up down here.  But the Klan has a lot of protest down here.  Yeah, I guess it has to do also with, you know, geography.  It's the territory that you're in.  You know, up in New York, like you said, if you had some Klan that's been protesting  in Central Park or something like that, they're going to get locked up down here.  They're allowed to say what they want.  And don't give me...  People are giving me the fire in a full movie theater thing.  That doesn't count.  That's not the same. 
[01:44:30]  It's called, I believe that's time, place, and manner in free speech, and that's not  fire in a crowded movie theater, protesting that you don't like Jews or black.  I mean, that's really not.  Let's go to Chris on Long Island.  Chris!  Sporty.  Chris, let's go, buddy.  Chris, hello.  Hey, you.  Must be a problem at the phone.  Let's say hi to Pete in Vermont.  Pete.  Hey, from a moral standpoint, Norton, I'm with you, but from a legal standpoint, I've got  to defend Ant on this one.  Hypothetical situation.  Imagine it's early 60s, and you're a family man with a bunch of your friends, and the KKK 
[01:45:00]  is having one of those cross-burning circle jerks, and you want to go protest it.  You're kind of risking your family's safety by protesting that type, because that group  of people is probably the one to go after your family for protesting it.  Yes, but the difference, you going to protest the Klan as they're fucking burning something,  they're just going to kick the shit out of you or kill you right there.  The reason, you understand.  It's possible.  I'm not sure what the point you're making.  Can you make the, I'm sorry, I just don't know your point. 
[01:45:30]  Yes.  From a moral standpoint, those Nazis protesting in Fairfield, absolutely, take your mask  off, don't be such a puss.  Right.  But from a legal standpoint, if you're looking at the whole free speech thing, and Ant was  saying they should be able to wear a mask to protect their jobs and their family,  imagine they were protesting something that's shitty.  Imagine a protest.  They're good dibs!  Huh?  What about the goddamn frunkers?  I'm not sure what you're saying, though.  Let's just move on.  Protesting the Klan because you're afraid of your family being killed by the Klan is different 
[01:46:00]  than being afraid of your boss yelling at you, which the Nazis are.  No one's going to go and kill your family.  Maybe they would.  You never know.  All right, let's go to Jim in Jersey.  Jim?  Maybe that's a good point.  Hey, Jim.  Uh, Jim's gone.  Oh, my God.  Hey, hung up the phone.  He was afraid.  Let's go to Graham in Pennsylvania.  Graham?  Hey, how's it going, gentlemen?  Hey, buddy.  Uh, yeah, I was just calling to say, uh, you know, I believe that, uh, those Nazis had  the right to express themselves openly, but I think that, uh, those Jews should have had 
[01:46:30]  the right to beat the shit out of them.  I agree.  Yeah, well, you know something?  Uh, maybe some kind of, um, confrontation, self-defense, whatever the fuck it is.  Uh, absolutely.  And, and it's just, there, there is a right to do something, and then there's just being  a fucking asshole.  Yeah.  Uh, and, and of course, you're going to have to, you're going to have to pay the consequences  for it.  So these three fucking idiots standing out there while, while, uh, you know, they're 
[01:47:00]  trying to light their menorah, uh, that's just a stupid, unnecessary, uh, hurtful thing  for, for them to have done.  So, um, but that's different than, than what I'm talking about, really.  It kind of got us started on the conversation, but, uh, it's, it's different than what I'm  talking about.  All right, uh, Q in New Orleans.  Q.  Q.  What's up, guys?  What's up?  Morning, fellas.  Hey.  I love you, Jimmy.  Thank you, buddy.  Thank you for greatness, baby.  Um, look, man, anytime you see black groups marching in, it's really in reaction to something 
[01:47:30]  that has happened, not a counteraction.  You don't see these, you don't see, you don't see, what was the last time you saw a black  group standing out front saying, oh, deaf to whitey, deaf to whitey.  All right.  It's in reaction to something that has happened.  You know what?  A lot of, a lot of times, uh, not a lot of times, I won't even, I won't even go that  far.  I'll say a few times I have seen, uh, black groups marching for something that I can't do.  I completely disagree with, uh, the gunning down of a drug dealer, uh, perhaps, and Reverend 
[01:48:00]  Al rallies the troops and marches, uh, against police brutality.  Um, I look at that as bullshit, um, uh, you know, how, how the fuck can they even do  this, but they got a right to, I don't agree.  I don't agree with it at all.  Exactly.  You don't agree with it.  And that's perfectly fine.  That's exactly what the constitution was based on.  Yeah.  And the fact that, but it's the fact that they are voicing a concern.  Hello?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  They're voicing a concern against something that has happened, not just to push an agenda. 
[01:48:30]  And like I said, you've got to understand another thing too, which I'm pretty sure you do,  in fact, blacks in this country for a long time, we didn't have all these so given rights.  Yeah.  But you don't have makeup rights.  Right.  But, but one of the ways that, that we were actually able to voice concern was too much,  was too rally.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  It's one thing, it's one thing if Nazis want to march because they found one of their  brethren singing from a tree. 
[01:49:00]  Doesn't matter.  Shot dead somewhere.  Yeah.  Then you've got the absolute reason to march or so.  Doesn't matter.  But it's a whole nother thing to say, well, we want to march just because we want to push  our agenda.  Of which it still happens, and of which I have no problem with that.  Yeah.  They're allowed to.  If you want to push your agenda, then you march to push your agenda.  But that's the thing.  When you see blacks marching, it's not to push their agenda.  It's usually in reaction to something.  That's a little naive, but.  Yeah.  And just in case you want to mention the Million Man March, how many times are you always saying, 
[01:49:30]  man, these black people need to get off the asses and do something?  Well, that was an action of them.  I had no, I, did I, did I, did I once bash the Million Man March when I was just discussing  it?  I didn't.  I just said they were allowed to.  I bashed it at home.  You can read between the lines.  You can read between the lines.  It's not stupid.  It's not transparent.  It's transparent.  It's not stupid.  I'm wise. 
[01:50:00]  Good conversation.  Good luck.  Good conversation.  I tell you, I was about five seconds from turning it off, but I love you guys.  Love you guys.  All right, Q.  Thank you.  Let's go to a Jewish accountant in Jersey.  What's up, sir?  Hi, sir.  I'm thinking that, you know, Anthony's a big fan of profiling, so I figure they're  probably just profiling the First Amendment, right, based on the fact that Nazis are pretty  much about one thing, genocide.  But black people, people are afraid to mess with that because on the one hand, they're  fighting for equal rights.  On the other hand, you don't want these black pants to cross the line and get into violence 
[01:50:30]  and all that.  Yeah.  Did you ever hear of a National Socialist group that wants to march and just push the  agenda of separatism between whites and blacks and Jews and not preach about killing because  that's, you know, what has got them in jams before in the past?  Absolutely.  I think Sons of Anarchy pretty much sums that up pretty well, this show.  They got National Socialists on that show, and they get into violence eventually. 
[01:51:00]  But that's just what the profiling's about.  Yeah, I hear you.  So, I don't know.  I mean, I just figured you'd like it because you're into profiling.  So, they're kind of profiling and, you know, like someone said, pushing a whole lot of  red tape so they can't get these permits.  Yeah, I hear you.  I just think, you know, it's a double standard thing.  But, yeah, we've ran through it here.  All right, brother.  I got a tinkle.  I got it.  Let's take a break here.  And now, such an important conversation.  Now, I just want to eat my sandwich.  There you go.  Hit the break.  O&A.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:51:30]  Hi.  On this Tuesday.  Tuesday.  By the way, everyone in the Twitter world.  Where's that?  They got the news yesterday.  We've got to at least make it official that the homeless shopping spree is dead.  I think you pretty much assumed that yesterday after our fine rant to start yesterday's show.  How did it happen?  Well, they were supposed to check on one last mall. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  Did they ever do that?  I don't know.  Last I heard that things were being, you know, looked into and checked and stuff.  But there doesn't seem to be a mall.  No.  No.  And no one's taking blame.  Everyone is doing a duck and cover and covering their own asses.  Duck and cover.  I guess officially we don't know who to blame.  But it's not happening.  The homeless shopping spree is done. 
[01:52:30]  And the shirts arrived yesterday, which makes it kind of sad.  So we're going to send those shirts off to some African country.  Like the championship Patriots shirts and things like that?  The 2009 homeless shopping t-shirts that arrived yesterday of all days.  Did they really?  Yeah.  So we sent that to a little country in Africa.  Oh, my God.  The little starving kids will be wearing the Opie and Anthony homeless shopping spree t-shirts.  Talking to their little friends with the World Series champion fillies on there.  There you go.  There you go.  I think that officially means no more O&A events, too, by the way. 
[01:53:00]  Because we just can't figure it out as a channel.  We just can't figure it out.  So it is official.  It was all over Twitter yesterday.  We're just making it official on our show.  It just seems too much liability that they don't want to handle.  Like no one wants to handle it.  And that includes us.  As a matter of fact, we're put in a position where liability is making things impossible to do anymore when they used to be doable. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  They changed our deal.  Litigation.  Where now we have to.  Ah, whatever.  Whatever.  We're not going to get into it.  Oh, there's a t-shirt.  There you go.  Should I have one?  Is that it?  Let me see.  I want a fucking.  Wow.  This is a collector's item.  This would have been nice, right?  Look at that.  Thank you, Sam.  I hate Steven Singer on the back.  Oh, yeah.  It had the date.  The Opie and Anthony show on the back.  Homeless shopping spree.  December 17, 2009.  I hate Steven Singer.  The event that never was.  Pennystockchaser.com was on here. 
[01:54:00]  Pennystockchaser.com.  I love that song.  Let me ask Sam something.  Sam, who do you blame for the homeless shopping spree not happening?  Keith the cop.  I don't know.  That's who I'm pinning the blame on.  I don't think there's anyone to blame.  I think just all the elements didn't quite come together this time.  Elephants.  Elements.  Oh, Steve C.  Elements.  Elements.  Okay.  I get it?  Yes.  Because he's so big.  So you're not naming names either, Sam? 
[01:54:30]  I mean, I just think, I don't know if you can hold one party responsible.  It's just so many things have to align properly.  Yeah, because it was such a hard event to get together.  That's right.  And they'll somehow blame the show.  They'll somehow make it look like they were reasonable, like, hey, but the guys said no.  Like, they won't ever say to each other in the meetings, look, we really did handcuff them by doing this, this, and this, making it impossible to pull off in a successful. 
[01:55:00]  They'll never say that among each other.  It'll somehow be we're difficult.  That we were difficult to work with and weren't flexible enough.  That's going to be a word, I bet, that gets thrown around a lot.  We weren't flexible enough in the planning of this.  Meanwhile, yeah, it'll be one of those, the quote will probably be, I don't know, we didn't get a mall, and then they didn't want to do it.  Yeah, but it's like.  Or something like, they'll have to say, they didn't want to do it. 
[01:55:30]  There was no mall, and so they didn't want to do it.  I don't know.  It's like, wait a minute.  They didn't want to go to the moon.  We didn't have a spaceship.  They didn't want to go.  They didn't want to go.  You're right, it all depends on the order they say it is.  They'll go, they didn't want to do it.  We couldn't get a mall, they didn't want to do it.  They won't say, they didn't want to do it, because we couldn't get a mall.  We couldn't get a mall, couldn't secure the mall.  They'll say there was no mall.  They'll say, there was no mall, and they didn't want to do it.  You guys are referring to the meeting that we had after the show, where they said, well, if you don't want to do it, we understand. 
[01:56:00]  And I looked at the guy, I go, there's nothing to do.  There's nothing to do, sir.  I mean.  Did they ever check on that last mall, out of curiosity?  I think that they, I mean, there were a lot of people with their heads down yesterday.  I don't know if there was a lot of, uh, why were their heads down?  They got a, I feel like they got quite a brow beating yesterday.  Oh, well.  Well, they did.  Maybe we could, uh, maybe we could learn from this.  Definitely some, uh.  Yeah, we have to move forward. 
[01:56:30]  Maybe they can learn from this.  The dog got hit with the rolled up newspaper yesterday.  Yikes.  Not the company.  Well, people that run the channel.  Well.  Not going after the company.  Can we do anything for the homeless?  Anything.  Yeah, what could we possibly do for the homeless that, okay, it's got to cover this.  Here's the criteria.  Do something for the homeless.  Um, uh, you know, that involves some of the money.  That was, uh, bally to bough.  Yeah, we got only three grand.  And make it entertaining for the listeners of this program. 
[01:57:00]  And make it fun.  What would management say?  Oh, da-da-da-da-da.  Yeah, you might as well just play that clip a million times.  Um.  I hear white noise right now.  Could we do something, though?  What could we do?  Yeah, bring the guys up here and hand money over.  Nah, that's not fun, though.  That doesn't fit the funness.  It doesn't fit the fun.  We had the bit. 
[01:57:30]  I want fun.  And it's an easy bit, and it shouldn't have been so complicated.  Well, that ain't happening.  Yeah.  And, you know, so let's just.  Does Steven Singer still want to be involved in it?  He's laughing.  He's laughing at the incompetence.  What?  Does he still want to do it?  I'm not even joking.  He's laughing at it.  I hate Steven Singer.  Me too.  Dot com.  No return calls from the mall?  Nope.  No response from the last mall on the list.  The final mall.  I think the word is that the sponsors still do want to do something because they like 
[01:58:00]  the show.  They just want the promotion.  Yeah, we like our sponsors.  It's great that they believe in us.  That's nice.  We had some good homeless people.  Yeah.  A good talent.  And, you know, I'd like to do something.  Just hand the money out.  That's not fun.  Yeah, we got to do something fun, entertaining.  Let's do something with the homeless, man, because they'll appreciate it.  We shouldn't fuck the homeless.  And if the PR department here could do anything, Syria should do a little something for the  homeless, too.  Because it's like, I know we fuck with them and goof on them, but the reality is we do 
[01:58:30]  want to see them get...  We're not a fucking charitable show, particularly, but once a year...  Particularly?  But you know what I'm saying?  At all.  We're not a bunch of assholes who try to go, hey, let's do a charity and get our faces...  Speak for yourself.  On TV.  I throw rocks at them.  Yes.  But it's like, you know what, man?  Every year we do something for them in the winter.  We should do something this year.  You know, the listeners are very smart.  They're coming up with it, homeless kerosene drinking, homeless fighting.  That's fantastic.  Get them laid. 
[01:59:00]  We could just get them prostitutes and have them fuck.  The listeners, they're like this.  We should do something that's entertaining.  Homeless fuckers.  I don't have...  Homeless rape spree.  Mudge fights.  Thermite painting contests.  This is all fantastic stuff.  The problem is I don't have the something and no one else has the something.  We all understand we want to do something.  We had the something.  And it's a no-brainer, easy bit to pull off if people don't get so involved. 
[01:59:30]  Lawyers don't get involved.  The thinking on this was ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  How they went about it.  But they're not going to acknowledge that they had any wrong in this whatsoever.  Last year it was CBS who fucked it up.  I would love to do something.  Of course.  I don't know what that is anymore.  I really don't.  Last year XM was totally on board.  And Logan was on board.  They were all...  And CBS fucked it up.  Tracy.  Oh, stupid Tracy.  It's these guys.  Or was that two years ago?  I mean two years ago.  Who the fuck knows?  But this year these guys fucked it up.  Nope. 
[02:00:00]  I don't know what the something is.  If someone else knows what the something is, that's great.  That'd be awesome.  But I don't have it.  I'm thinking something with homeless on a flatbed truck.  I just don't know what.  Under a flatbed truck would be a solution.  How about we punch a homeless people on a flatbed truck and we have it right around and they  have a sign that says, we're bums and we're hungry.  You would get a million guys to do that to it.  Oh, God damn.  You would have no problem doing that. 
[02:00:30]  We're bums.  God damn it.  There's got to be something.  Yeah.  Well.  Yeah.  Well, we got...  It's hard to come up with a something when you had the something.  I know.  It's frustrating, but...  It's a no-brainer, too.  I mean, our record show that the promotion was a great one that...  And no one got...  There was no issues.  There were never any issues.  You know.  I know.  The record speaks for itself.  You know what?  We are pigeonholing ourselves. 
[02:01:00]  I agreed.  What we got to do...  I know we had the thing.  It was homeless shopping spree.  Right.  It's fucking brilliant.  Gone.  Over.  There's fucking Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and then we're, you know, vacation.  Why not save the money, tell the sponsors, hold on till we get back, and have some kind  of another event with the homeless that involves a different holiday.  Perhaps New Year's Eve or something, or some New Year's thing, or Valentine's Day. 
[02:01:30]  We won't be back, but Valentine's Day.  Or like a Valentine's Day.  Kiss that Michelob bottle.  It's fucking, you know, a homeless match, like match making.  I'm just brainstorming here.  Look at me.  Look at me go.  Well, for what it's worth, you have the $3,000 guaranteed until Friday.  All right, but they can be talked to. 
[02:02:00]  We could talk to these people.  We know people in the newspapers, but if it's a dirty sponsor, wait a minute.  Can't we have some kind of a bum talent show?  I would love a bum talent show where we actually have people, maybe some of our own people here  in the organization that can train, like not train them, let's say, help them practice  certain dance numbers, song numbers.  I don't want that motherfucker mustard singing, though, because he's just too good at that. 
[02:02:30]  He's got to do some ballet.  Well, they don't all win the big money.  There's something there.  We can have the homeless somehow entertain us.  Yes.  Homeless paintball.  That would be fun.  Watch them shoot each other.  Maybe a talent show.  A talent show might be good.  A homeless talent show would be fucking...  A homeless talent show.  Put on like an old high school talent show.  Well, their talents will have to be approved by management.  You know that, right?  They could compete against management.  Yeah.  I think...  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  A homeless talent would have to...  There's something.  Oh. 
[02:03:00]  Too bad we can't get it ready by...  Can we?  The dumpster dive.  I don't see why not.  I mean...  But it would be hard to tell the home...  You'd have to...  You can't have them rehearse...  Whoever...  You can't...  They can't rehearse.  No.  How about this?  If you live until Friday...  We have them somehow do something...  Do you have any talent, sir?  We're part of a radio show.  We have X amount of dollars.  We've been giving out this, this, and this...  For people that have some kind of fucking talent.  A homeless cherry tarts. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, would that be wonderful?  Would that be disgusting?  That's nudity, guys.  Come on.  But it's male nudity.  Come on.  What would management say?  God damn it.  There's that little fucking glass room in there.  We can't get a few listeners up here...  By fucking...  Friday morning or something...  And just round up a five or six or ten homeless people...  Have a talent show.  Dude, this is...  We want to do the shopping spree.  The listeners know we got fucked.  This is not like we're saying to the listeners... 
[02:04:00]  This is what we prefer to do.  We want to do something.  Because otherwise you get nothing.  Sponsors would need to sign off on any idea we come up with.  Yeah, fair enough.  But a talent show is pretty fucking, you know...  It could be entertaining.  And it's light enough where they're not going to freak out.  Every bum would say he can sing.  Of course.  You hear them out there?  They would have to approve...  Management would have to approve their talents.  And I guarantee some of the things they would want to do...  Management would go, you know what? 
[02:04:30]  We can't have that.  They'd try to hire half of them and give them channels.  Extreme shitting.  What are they going to do with talent?  I think we've got to stop thinking about doing events.  Because there will always be some weird issue that we can't foresee.  Well, you know what the best thing...  For real.  I'm not even trying to be...  I'm not trying to be Debbie Downer.  I'm being a real...  But that's not a bad idea.  It's a great idea, Jimmy.  It really is a great idea.  We've had a lot of great ideas.  And then you throw it through the management fucking cog system they have. 
[02:05:00]  And then it's spit out in a way that you're like, what?  This ain't going to work.  Understand this, though.  I think we just...  If we come up with something before fucking Friday that is a viable idea and they shoot it down,  do you know how utterly fucking contemptible that will make them even more so than with this whole thing?  We've actually went above and beyond, tried, and got shot down again?  It would be crazy.  With an idea that isn't insane.  It's an actual fucking good idea.  They would get money, people entertained. 
[02:05:30]  I like the idea of maybe being able to get people up here into the room and have them fucking just...  Or that glass room out there or something like that.  I don't care where the fuck they are.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Why am I yelling at Jimmy?  I don't know.  But, yeah, that would be like something.  And then if for any reason they said no to that, we just say, okay, then to me, I wash my fucking hands of this.  I do anyway because I'm afraid of H1NY.  I wash all the time.  So I can push this button. 
[02:06:00]  As you should.  You should fucking wash your elbow and really give it a good shot.  They're not even pressuring us to give the money away at this point.  So, you know.  That's what I actually just want to do.  It's nice to be charitable and make my money.  All right.  So what's the bit?  I would think get some people up here and get these fucking homeless guys to do something.  Stand-up comedy, singing, soft chew.  Dude.  Whatever the fuck he wants to do.  If we tell them, if Keith just grabs the homeless and tells them, look, we got some money, can you do this, this, or this, we guarantee each one of them an appearance fee. 
[02:06:30]  This way they know they're not going to be fucked over.  You give them each, we'll give you 50 bucks for coming.  You get the money.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's not a fucking setup.  Immediately.  You get a $50 appearance fee.  So they know they're making 50 bucks.  They come in.  We give them something to eat.  We can't give them liquor here.  Obviously, that'd be a suicidal move to give them liquor when I'm running around a fucking billion dollar facility.  Here, you'll eat these wires.  But I think you could get a decent amount of fucking people and you corral them up in that area in the front, inside. 
[02:07:00]  And you know what?  What is the rest of the employees going to say?  We don't want the fucking homeless charity here?  Why not, man?  That would look pretty ugly on the front page of the Daily News.  We'd bump Tiger off with that one, I think.  I kind of like it.  I think it involves listeners.  I want the listeners involved.  Yeah.  I think it's good for the homeless.  It would be funny. 
[02:07:30]  And it would be good because, you know, you get that goddamn mustard guy to play a song in front of the people.  That's cool.  And it gives us the opportunity again to talk to some of our stupid listeners that come up, which is always good.  Never good, by the way.  Oh, never.  To correct you.  I meant never.  Get Steve to talk to the guys and see if they can get the fishbowl.  Yeah.  I mean, there's no reason they shouldn't give it to us.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  I mean, you know what I mean?  It's like, believe me, I know how they work here.  It's awful.  But that's a very...  That's an idea.  That we're floating.  There you go. 
[02:08:00]  Now, float it over to that homo and have him float it to fucking...  Yes.  Oh, that one.  I mean, Steve.  Are there other homos around here that I don't know about?  Don't know.  Shut my dick.  Okay.  I mean, no.  So, we'll try to figure it out by Friday, but that's it.  Yeah, I guess the homeless shopping spree is not happening officially.  So, just so you guys know that.  Why don't we take another break, regroup, and we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:08:30]  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  opiate anthony hi so now we uh what happened sam we wrote up our our new idea for the homeless 
[02:09:00]  yes it's been written up and given to the proper the person with the proper authority  wait so we came up with this idea to kind of try to save our homeless thing yeah which seems like  it's a no-brainer yeah yeah but then they told us shopping spree then they told us we had to write  it up yeah be written up and submitted and who'd you submit it to rob croft for your approval and 
[02:09:30]  what does he do rob croft i think he's like the like the program director type so he's what of  this channel so he'd be steve carlisi's boss yeah he's above what boss he's above steve what so he's  right above steve so he read it and now what happens so then he will now steve steve wrote  it up no no i wrote it oh you wrote it so sam you wrote up this very easy thing that we want to do 
[02:10:00]  on friday which is bring the homeless up do some kind of talent show thing i just wrote down the  sponsors fucking give the homeless money have listeners up here it'll be it haven't had listeners  up in a while that sounds fun it would be a great friday show yeah but we had to write it up you had  to write it up to give it to rob and now who does he give it to now rob will start giving it up to the  you know the people in promotions and he'll find out from the talent department if that studio is  booked uh-huh and he'll you know the but the main thing will be giving it to the people in like  promotions and sales and all those people and the legal team now who have to determine if this is 
[02:10:30]  legal and if the sponsors will accept it of course it's legal um now uh ballpark have you asked rob or  anybody ballpark how long is this going to take to fester i do think that they are on a on a rush  job on this fast track it's called okay fast track yes they're on the fast track okay because  they know that if it's not done by friday they've lost a lot of money yeah yes this is something that 
[02:11:00]  has to be done and then fast track it they know that i think it's being fast tracked blue sky it  or tee it up what what do i what am i doing in corporate knees trying to get it green light green  light so far we're at a yellow no it's got to bake first idiots oh yeah it's got to bake first  everyone knows is it on the front burner yes all right you gotta bake it before you fucking blue  sky it yeah yeah blue sky it it's just you know we're gonna tee it up for promotions and say tee  it up shut up i want to hook up electrodes to the genitals of everyone that works here and every 
[02:11:30]  time they use a phrase like that you give them a shock until then it comes using their corporate  slacks we're gonna blue so now what are we waiting on yeah now what's the next step we have to  wait to pass through the proper channels and then come back down i'm sure there'll be many  questions it's got to go up somewhere and then down again yeah it's got to go up how high up does  it go i mean pretty high up this will be a terrific exercise altitude wise several links on the chain 
[02:12:00]  yeah that's the problem there's too many fucking links all right so it's gonna be some links this  is gonna be a great exercise i'm gonna sit back and watch this develop it's a long chain it goes up  the chain and then each link has questions and then the questions start trickling aside  no all right so you wrote up the the proposal for the easiest fucking radio bid i i could think of  it was very quickly written up by the way so that's how easy so it is to explain from idea  yes to being written up that someone had to actually read it yeah before he moves it to somebody else 
[02:12:30]  and then when does it start branching off to all sorts of other people well i think it will now start  branching off he'll probably have to send it cc a few people on cc who will then and a couple of  blind cc's because that's how those fuckers work and then they'll forward it to their supervisors  who will reply with questions and the questions will start trickling down for the easiest radio  bit that you could think of by the way the homeless talent show this doesn't it doesn't involve leaving  the building no so there's no issues about being at some other venue where they have to worry about 
[02:13:00]  you know uh other people and things like that it's a matter of just we have a select number of  listeners that can come up fill that room up there's our live audience we have the homeless  people that have certain talents they will perform in front of the uh uh crowd and then uh they will  be judged and um and uh similarly executed after the judgment i don't know that wasn't in the right now 
[02:13:30]  it wasn't no you didn't write that down the execution oh shit oh because that's the funnest part  i mean i could send a reply all yeah sam i want you in i want you on this one so go down the hole  now and see where this piece of paper is yes the the whole rest of the show i want updates i want  you interrupting whatever the fuck we're doing for for updates okay now i want it's gonna mean a lot  of running so run now and i want him to run back look at his silly run how great would it be if he 
[02:14:00]  just tripped and fell sideways through that glass and died and cut himself in half no just died and his  body was left there as they ran around trying to make this bit happen i want to say uh god bless  anthony cumia and god bless jim norton because i wish i had the patience you guys had what i am out  of my fucking mind biting my fucking teeth right now patience is a but you and i know if i had more  patience and understanding i wouldn't have done as much damage in my career as i have but it's not  out of my fucking mind about how this shit goes down dude i find it i i gotta at least express 
[02:14:30]  that but so are we yeah it's almost like yeah but you guys i can't even i can't even i can't even  i can't even function right now you guys are at least functioning dude do you understand  what a gotcha this is no no no no fucking props no no no i i'm sitting here i can't even function  you're functioning you're functioning i don't have it in my fucking body to function let me explain  something and that is my biggest flaw and i understand that let me explain wait sam's back 
[02:15:00]  yes before you explain all right they said no they said we don't want bums in our facility unless  they're wearing ties and making decisions oh shit the kid is funny oh come on all right sam  well it's been looked at by uh our liaison to the legal team liaison to the legal yes uh looks fine to  him but the lawyers but that means exactly is it you do i'm sick of hearing it looks fine to me  because that means shit i'm a people person that means shit but the lawyers they're not here yet 
[02:15:30]  okay so we'll have to wait for the why what time does somebody lift up the rock snake fall  so i hope no one pours salt on them on the way here they'll just fucking disintegrate they need a  slimy trail to slither from the fucking subway up we just can i can i tell you something oh this is  where i i emotionally i i really agree with hope i i absolutely absolutely this is why i look at  the way it's infuriating this is the why despite my fucking anger and you know how disgusted i am 
[02:16:00]  i i and i'm not being politically correct i look at a guy like leno the situation the anger he's got  to feel and he's never even expressed it to me in private i watched the way he handles himself and  conducts himself and i said to him the last time i saw him like dude you never say stupid things in  interviews he said shut up and keep sucking yeah no no he didn't even say that he just slapped my  face he said quiet bitch with your mediocre segment but he's like oh you know he just got it and he  just he's just a smart fucking dude it's almost like that's a guy who could have let emotion get 
[02:16:30]  the best of him because he you know look that was a weird thing mbc did and instead of doing that  he fucking just does his job for five fucking years knowing that's hanging over him yeah he's still  number one and then when it comes time they can't cut him they cannot let him go because he's number  one and they don't want to compete with him so i'm sure they threw a boatload of money at him  and they change the face of fucking the network for him yeah like regardless of where it goes it's like 
[02:17:00]  that was a guy who could have bitched and moaned and just didn't and it's like i watched that oh my god  i get so fucking angry over shit and when you play it smart there is a way to financially fuck them in  the end for it it's like you know what i mean it's a that's a guy who could have really got  and i want i wanted to explain also this is the opposite of the kobayashi maru now if you're familiar  with a little film called the wrath of khan uh and of course the new star trek they have to run  through a test called the kobayashi maru it is a no-win scenario it is the no-win scenario 
[02:17:30]  this is the opposite of it this now is win-win because here's what happens though and i the you're  you're furious about this but we do this and and we're able to do it then look we did exactly what  you said we came up with another idea it's fun for us fun for the show fun for the homeless they get  the money this that blah blah blah if they don't if they don't allow this even better i'm saying i'm 
[02:18:00]  going on the air and saying this if they don't allow this even better than them allowing it because  it shows that we again jump through the hoops we tried we bent over backwards came up with an idea  and again but we got shot down and then there's no way they can even fake blaming us proved they're  incompetent doesn't matter doesn't matter they won't have been to each other so now we're going to prove  that they're more incompetent they won't that's insane they will never admit to that and never come  to us and go they know the homeless shopping spree oh and i said nothing they know it now we came up 
[02:18:30]  with another idea very short time it can only it's a win-win win-win whether this gets pulled  off or not you have to look at it that way it's a business decision like i'm looking at it in a  business way they believe me on a personal level i've gotten along with everybody here and not one  of them has showed me a fucking ounce of respect in a situation i'm having it's a business decision  how about they're held accountable for fucking up our bit um what will happen to them for fucking 
[02:19:00]  nothing that's the way it goes but that's always the way it's going to go exactly but they'll cover  their ass and go well it was actually this and this and this and blah blah blah no it was you  we're the cbs executives that make the bad decision they never get fired it was never that fucked us  up not us doesn't matter but then look at look how we handled it we fucking improvised adapt overcame  we come up with another fucking idea we run that through the mill and again if they spit it out and  say no then we go look what the fuck do you want us to do keep coming up with fucking ideas that 
[02:19:30]  you're going to shoot down do you know how discouraging that is or you know but and that's  where i feel like we're there already no i don't i know not in this situation we're battling i'm not  we're battling i'm right and you're wrong i but that i already feel that we're there already because  it's an entity that doesn't identify that what else do you want from us we suggested this idea months  ago and i didn't even think we were doing it and then two three weeks ago they said good news we're  doing the homeless shopping spree and i went what i forgot about that months ago getting fucked twice 
[02:20:00]  will be so much better it's just dude it's a business decision that's how i can remain patient  business believe me well you know how i feel in a personal life we got it's a business decision it's  business opie you're taking this very personally very but he's taking this very personally we do have  some issues that we have to figure out not not between us by certainly not between the show  members no but no no no yeah yeah we're holding up our end of the bargain and and and and it's 
[02:20:30]  it's getting harder to do this you know what's frustrating despite my situation i know these guys  like me i really do like on a personal level i've talked to them i know they like me as a guy i know  they think hey he's a funny guy he contributes doesn't matter it doesn't stop them from doing what  they're doing so it's like you know my feelings shouldn't stop me from doing look i'll meet with  bladder myself it'll be somewhere safe our studio our office we'll go in there sit down i'll talk with  them for a while and i'll give them the idea i'm not looking at jimmy why i the beautiful hold on 
[02:21:00]  the beautiful thing was you guys can't see i'm talking with a broken jaw i love anthony i knew he was  doing michael corleone i'm talking with a broken jaw because mccluskey punched me but the beautiful  and now i understand why he did the thing was as anthony was talking i'm looking at him and his  eyes opened a little bit which you can only see if you're in the room which says i know this one's  gonna bomb and yet i'm committed to it i'm in a situation there's nothing worse than when you're in a 
[02:21:30]  broken jaw character and you think i can't stop my broken jaw yeah uh sam run down the hall  and whoever the liaison to lawyers is get an update yes an update and if and if he says again  they're not here yet say don't you have the uh capability of calling them because we're under  the gun oh good idea that's not coming from you it's coming from anthony and myself that is a good  idea it call them because that is the first problem i have already with what has been going on the last 
[02:22:00]  half hour yes if everyone's under the gun and we're bending over backwards to try to figure this shit  out and help the company and help our show a little bit yep why are they waiting for lawyers  to come in when they possibly have their fucking numbers and you think the lawyers are going to come  in and instantly jump on this no or the 20 000 other fucking things that they have to do of course not  my god man goodness gracious 
[02:22:30]  homeless smelling bee shut up  there's something uh we can do we came up with it yeah let's stop yeah for real let's just stop  we came up we came up with the easiest bit possible maybe we can have other prizes talent money here you  go maybe there's other prizes too whoever has the most horrendous pair of underwear on  oh that is pretty good other ways to give the money yes well they have to rewrite the what they 
[02:23:00]  will throw it in on the air we'll just do that once they're in we're in they have to rewrite the  once they're in that fishbowl with the audience in there we lock the fucking door  and then we can just do whatever we want and the bathroom's right there  fucking executions be great i do i think like plugging up any crack and filling it up with  water would be fantastic just watch them slowly drown here comes sam here comes sam he's running  down the hall he hasn't worked out this much a workout huh look at him he's a young kid and he  already has fucking no muscle tone he's the liaison to a you're the liaison to the liaison what's up 
[02:23:30]  he's on the phone with the lawyer right now oh he is oh and what is he doing talking i know  he's talking 1-800 scum some lawyer answers we got it jim okay uh what is yeah he's just talking  on the phone to the lawyer okay we'll fuck up your bit you have enough to worry about  so what is he talking about he's describing the yes now now now now now is he accurately depicting 
[02:24:00]  what we want how can you fuck this one up see this is this is written down yeah but now the  interpretation between page and eye and mouth and lawyer ear can get fucked up someone ought to be  monitoring what he's saying and correcting every so often go no no it's this it's this we need  well that's the benefit the email i think that they always have us email so they have it on paper  saying no this is what you wanted but now that's going to work in our favor too can i see the proposal 
[02:24:30]  yes you may hang on please get me the proposal i want to see because i know we sat here and hatched  it uh all by ourselves just moments ago i want to see how it was then written down look at sam  his run to say he has dumb feet is an insult to ducks i'm taking bets by the way all right  what is going to be the big thing that they say what's going to be i'm going to fuck this up i'm going  with no live audience allowed i don't know about that that's just what i'm going with i don't know 
[02:25:00]  about that because their instinct is to fuck it up their inclination is to fuck it up but the bottom  line is there's money at stake they don't care what are you going for uh what do you think it will be  the the fucking honestly laziness plug laziness yeah a general malaise yeah they're not going to  want to work uh hard to get this done within two three days well that's that's they're on the phone  bank on it they're on the phone right now they understand we have no confidence in the people that 
[02:25:30]  are running this channel right none that needs to be said okay look so now they have to now they  have to uh prove themselves yeah but this is but this is like easy so even lazy people can uh  can get something accomplished that's what do you think will be the the the monkey wrench though  as far as uh saying well it's because of this what'll be their reason they won't go well we're lazy  they don't what'll what'll they say uh we don't have enough time to put this together but it's easy 
[02:26:00]  it's together here comes uh sam all right look at him running with the scroll look he looks like a  fucking town crier yes hear ye hear ye i'm a douche yes i would be doing this but i don't want to run  all right give me the uh proposal  let me get this three copy who doesn't love sam here's what we want to do with the three large  we want to do a homeless talent show keith the cop would round up between six to ten  or so homeless people in the morning of we would broadcast regular time six a.m that's negotiable

[02:29:00]  all right an update yes we have cleared one hurdle all right one hurdle yes we can't have what  we clear them backwards well we're gonna forge right ahead and go for the whole bit  the legal hurdle has been cleared we are legally allowed to do this all right see look at my  prediction was correct yes the phone call the legal now it's logistics now there's three things that  has to happen number one all right the moon has to spin off its axis yes and plow into the pacific 
[02:29:30]  we need bums then what number one well i guess it's four things that you need bums but that's you know  yes neither here nor there that's keith and we know how he's fucked up jesus christ number one  we need to ensure that we can have the studio and that is something that we have to be done through  talent okay now all right go to town who yes right now wait for those idiots yeah don't wait who's who's  in charge that go to them right now and see what leads i guess go to steve right now and see if the 
[02:30:00]  fishbowl steve leads availability fishbowl go there it goes run all right  just like watching him run it's amazing he's like he should be going whack whack whack whack  sam doesn't know how to exercise whatsoever never played a sport he doesn't have to he weighs 30 pounds  yeah why would he's 30 pounds he stops running when he thinks we can't see him we can see you yeah  he's got the he has the girth and the weight of a butter cookie  oh and i guess he just asked where steve leads is now he's just wandering aimlessly he's looking around 
[02:30:30]  very confused i think there's some kind of nerve gas at that end of the building that just puts  people to sleep i don't know what it is all right so now he's going to check on the availability of  fishbowl that is our second hurdle out of four are there four hurdles all right here he comes  of course he'll say he's not in yet yeah and then we'll say get him on the fucking phone pronto uh yes  steve leads is not in because he's in nashville today but liam is on his way in and he'll be able 
[02:31:00]  to check now isn't there a schedule isn't there a schedule you have of what that there isn't some  guy that knows it in his head the schedule lives on the intranet and so liam would have to log on  through his intranet and and find the talent bookings troy kwan also has a book with fucking  shit written or a calendar troy kwan could lock it up troy kwan is checking to see if the studio is 
[02:31:30]  open now if it's open that's a good sign but that could still mean that if there's a high profile guest  coming a sign what are you a psychic this is no we need to know it would be good but if there's a high  profile guest coming that maybe everybody else wasn't alerted to which has happened before  they would need the fishbowl for that okay high profile guest is one thing that's something liam  would have to look into through his uh well monster doing solo tell liam in his creepy shirts  liam is a nice guy with the creepiest collection of shirts liam dresses him and fucking kevin bacon 
[02:32:00]  and the woodsman trade shirts do you think i was really gonna bomb on that one i had to tag it  that's all i like i like that it started as a bomb he wears different sneakers too let's not forget  now steve's coming is he even involved with yes he is he's going to say we couldn't get a mall  i have these shirts but should we go over the other hurdles oh shit what does steve have 
[02:32:30]  that's good any new information yes the studio is being used on friday uh it is booked from 6 a.m.  to 11 a.m. they're finding out if it can be moved i can't i can't do afternoons on thursday anymore  okay for real for real i can't okay because that was another question that got brought up  i really can't i what about thursday morning what's this you gotta run steve  you run  thursday morning means we have one less day  okay friday friday afternoon i was asking for friday morning i can't do friday afternoon but i can 
[02:33:00]  do friday morning thursday i can do friday afternoon i was confused i really can't do  well if jimmy can't do friday afternoon we'll do friday morning then friday morning it has to be a  morning time on friday morning but i'll see but get it moved see if it can be moved who is it  check thursday cosmo radio oh get the fuck out of here get the fuck out yeah what i wouldn't have  come in with that update i wouldn't what is that no you have to come in with these updates what are  they doing with cosmic radio cosmo radio cosmo radio what the fuck it's for ladies what are they 
[02:33:30]  doing in there yeah what are they doing what are they doing and this is friday morning right  uh there's friday morning 6 to 11 a.m they'll i'm assuming be broadcasting their morning show  from the fishbowl they had no no no because they booked it well let's just see but maybe maybe it  can be moved look really it better fucking be moved greenstein can override anybody oh my god  now the other hurdles are also there are some i'll just go with it you're right jimmy let's see 
[02:34:00]  greenstein could over override he can you know he can let's see if he does there's some people who  have raised concern as to whether or not technologically we will be able to broadcast  and have a you know a broadcast to our standards why this is a podcast they had haven't they had  broadcast in there in every way shape and have artists perform there yes it's been said that our  equipment is uh different than the rest of the equipment at sirius xm why and so that would be  easier said than done well no no because we realize we're not going to have internet and tvs and shit 
[02:34:30]  we need microphones okay for uh the talent up the other issue how they made everything complicated so  overly complicated seats for the people and uh a little uh microphone for the uh homeless guy  we're not what equipment wouldn't they have in the fishbowl that we need i'm gonna have an aneurysm  assuming i'm gonna have an aneurysm you suck at assuming that uh i fucking hate you i just love 
[02:35:00]  this i hate you with every cell in my body you're doing this to me on purpose you know damn well how  this is gonna fucking play out oh believe me i couldn't know i couldn't know more i just went from  so mad to really happy though for some reason it's stellar because it gets to a point it's just so  ridiculous you can't be mad anymore this is stellar you can't be now assuming the technologic technologically  it works you mean the microphones yes in a radio fucking complex and assuming that cosmo doesn't 
[02:35:30]  mind moving you know their show which would be very nice of them and and i want to know what cosmo is  doing yeah that they need that they need the fishbowl right instead of just two people  talking in a big fishbowl we also oh this fucking thing we also need to get it it has not yet spin  no it's a dumb stop saying this sorry the tiger woods mistress sex tape oh that's stupid where 
[02:36:00]  he lines up the girl yes enough we've all seen it god it's stupid it has not yet been approved  by the sponsors okay all right but i don't see i don't if they were on board for homeless shopping  spree they got to be on board for homeless talent show i believe that to be the case yes so do i i  don't see that hurdle being a problem but now the equipment hurdle i mean oh my god mics mic cords 
[02:36:30]  can you get plugs can you get more info on the equipment equipment problem i'll talk to me i'll  talk to marcelino get marcelino and say what equipment problems will we run into he doesn't  even know in here every day how is he gonna know i know please this is a great exercise for listeners  then you'll understand what we go through here comes mars now this should oh look at mars mars come  on in mars you're great on mike have you dealt it with the fishbowl in any fashion a little bit  and there will be no problems at all whatsoever all right there you go saying there would be 
[02:37:00]  problems sam yeah sam who said that yeah mark the only guy who does jiu-jitsu and still gets fat i  mean what what oh jesus uh sam what what the reason i want to know who said this is i want to know  who's gearing up to shut this down already by throwing that out there who said equipment one of  our liaisons said that it would be possibly easier said than done okay who name names it was the man i 
[02:37:30]  was walking in the hallway with that is and that bullshit by the way that's bullshit you're just  warning us there's a just in case or be prepared no that is a that is that is posturing that is  posturing to to that's putting on a raincoat before it starts raining that's what that is i've seen this  before oh i've seen it then if it doesn't about the equipment i don't know what he what do you mean  what did he say he said that we have a very customized uh setting when we're doing the show  from in here if we were just us with mics then it's fine uh excuse me remember when i said lazy 
[02:38:00]  thank you i sit back now maybe he just lazy you know why because the people that work around us  yeah don't want to be they don't give a shit about success like we do lazy maybe he just was  concerned that you guys wouldn't have the show that you would want he wanted to make sure it  was all there for you we're excuse me all we already admitted we just need three fucking mics  some smelly homeless fucking bombs and a couple uh a few dozen listeners how hard is this we want 
[02:38:30]  to have people on this show every day by the way we want to have people who shit their pants  sing songs tell them we don't have fucking it's like perlman coming to play silent night yeah  we don't need a 24 track mixing board so mars is saying there's no problem with the equipment  there we go go back to the liaison and tell them that and what else uh do we need what is cosmo  doing we need to find out friday morning find out okay you find out what cosmo has planned and why  they have it booked okay run okay there he goes he's off with a little duck feet can we do live

[02:42:30]  where's our audience sitting it's big enough to fit like 12 audience members in there no we're  12 audience members wow yes have you ever seen we're popular have you ever seen the fishbowl when  someone's playing and it's just got chairs all over and there's a bunch of people that's what we're  gunning for here oh this has got to be big can they put the cosmo show in there if it's big enough  only if they can fit all the trumpeters trumpeters and our fucking runway and the sweaters and sweaters  no one listens to cosmo radio well let's see what they say they haven't said no yet they haven't said 
[02:43:00]  that they can't switch thursday six to ten seems to be open would you like to do it on thursday to  avoid any uh crossing with the trumpeters i would prefer friday but i think that if thursday is an  option and you know people took off work thursday already because they thought they were going to  the shopping spree well find out how many listeners were a lot of yes find that out okay now find out  how many we can work and then no matter what they say say not enough give me another live read is 
[02:43:30]  early morning i don't remember why freak is early morning better to do it or in the afternoon for  homeless people what do you think i can't do thursday afternoon no i'm just saying in general  we could do uh we could do uh i could do friday afternoon and i could do you know thursday morning  will be fine i think thursday morning will be fine we'll get them in here they'll be all groggy  they won't be all fucking you know completely gone they won't actually be hammered you might get  them awake from the night before too which could mean they could be enchanting yes all the breath on them 
[02:44:00]  morning breath homeless morning breath so so they're using the fishbowl for a fashion show  a radio a radio fashion show a fashion show on the radio with um with a trumpeters opie trumpeters  to trumpet in the um the holiday sweater fashion show  i thought it was cosmo kramer when uh you popped up those pictures i thought that was his radio show  and he was just going to get out there and throw the n-word out uh in the fishbowl  which would have really been funny should we take a break i have to tank on you yeah 
[02:44:30]  all right let's get all the reconnaissance is going to come in and then we'll come back from  break and let everybody know how far uh uh we're advancing this running down so we could get a break  we could get an update before the break and then we'll break and then he'll he'll work the the the  the whatever's uh after uh i don't even know what i'm saying oh sam sam you realize it's a fashion show  on the radio right for sweaters so that could obviously be canceled well no because they have 
[02:45:00]  trumpeters and then you have to cancel all the trumpeters or put them in another room  what trump what are you playing who gives a shit here's a red one with some um holly uh on the  sleeves i guess you're now presenting something you will never get pussy in  this one's from van heusen go ahead sam it's one by jimmy norton go ahead sam well the thing about it is 
[02:45:30]  in the fishbowl we can fit this is just ballpark they don't know for sure but in the fishbowl  they're guesstimating 10 to 20 people okay and in how do you go 10 to 20 in the other studio more  like 10 to 12 because the thing is we can't line them up in rows outside the fishbowl they can't play  our show outside they have to be inside we don't want it we understand but i've seen the room in there  we don't override that and play our show outside for one fucking oh no it's we're bending over 
[02:46:00]  backwards and trying to make the company money and save some fucking that's that's the league  that's a legal issue with uh content resources human resources and people working in a hostile  work environment that will never get through also as far as thursday goes yeah it is open from six  to 8 15 only well what's what's from what happened jesus 8 15 oh my god he's gonna explode uh  oh my god what happened today troy pulled up the intranet and at 8 15 the car just called the 
[02:46:30]  internet it's the intranet yes it's inside company internet what uh what happens the cardinal  has booked studio time in the fishbowl is he well how about this which one maybe the cardinal  oh i thought it was a baseball player maybe the cardinal would be willing to trade studios because  we're doing something for homeless people we're gonna bounce the card now voluntarily maybe he  would be willing to knowing we're doing something charitable event we could ask the cardinal 
[02:47:00]  where are we at bumping uh cosmo should i go find out absolutely all right there is no  fucking way the cardinal is moving for the ophian anthony show why the cardinal guarantee it why he's  got a better shot of moving than the car the cosmo does no way they would not diss the cardinal like  that's not dissing him oh it's dissing that's saying we're doing a homeless talent show to get money  for the homeless can they move and he'd probably go yeah he'd go jesus christ jimmy you're joking i'm 
[02:47:30]  not please say you're joking now something you'll never get laid in  i'm being a trumpeter he's a trumpeter look it's wool with reindeer on it  let's say hi to steve in pennsylvania steve i'm not a good trumpeter steve steve hey hey good morning  guys what's happening man hey uh yeah npa now we didn't confuse me a little bit but yeah i just 
[02:48:00]  popped over to cosmo and they're having a little uh bitch fit they're saying that oh and a uh you  know because you guys can't do the right thing and get a uh mall that uh you're trying to uh you  know take away their sweater thing no we were able to get them all by the way yeah the bit was  done our way i don't want people to confuse the issue we were able to get them all if we did the  bit our way enough with that shit um so and they're threatening they're threatening you guys saying  there's no fucking way and they just you know put it out there again that it's going on nine to 
[02:48:30]  eleven at the fishbowl and fuck you guys i don't believe cosmo said fuck us well not in so many  but you know they're catty fucking are they broads yeah broads over there yeah well there's a guy  he's a broads haven't where do they broadcast sam right down there broad go ask them personally i  mean i don't go ask them personally no let's see what they think no ask them nicely knock on their  door and say i gotta and you can wait you can wait till they're in break because that would be  outrageous if something crazy happened on the radio show well there are they'd get in such trouble 
[02:49:00]  radio show hosts who have accused you guys of being hostile in the work environment and i'm afraid  that cosmo would who well i mean he whose name shall not be mentioned the gay show you know the  guy with you just being yeah we get we get along with the gays now the guy who you know that guy  yeah yeah i don't want another all right just just politely when they go to break i'm serious  ask them ask them go and you can even say don't kill the messenger all right you'll be fine you have 
[02:49:30]  another update i asked our liaison where we were at with bumping cosmo yeah he said  nowhere yet but we're pursuing all options more corporate that's corporate lingo his testicles  would be getting shocked right now and he'd become these in his pants if jimmy had his leg and he  wonders why he's wearing a tie he's a professional is he at what liaisoning  well in the corporate world that's a good gig here for real that's a great gig to have it oh another 
[02:50:00]  option here's the other option yes um and i'm not letting them off the hook cardinal i understand  you can't push the card you can't do it if he volunteers but you can't move him oh what are the  odds they would allow us because we can get audio out in this hallway right here because we're kind  of sequestered what are the odds they would allow us to have listeners outside this studio  and play our audio right here if people were what hold on if people were funneled around the other way 
[02:50:30]  so they didn't have to deal with it because there's other ways to get to everything here  you know what though it's not that audience performer uh setup we need like it was at the other place i  know audience is set up there they'd be down the hall how do you how do you know i mean right  right here boom right around if you open the door that's a cozy 10 people and i have to guess  that the odds of that being allowed are very slim to none all right i'll tell you the truth  stop stalling go talk to cosmo we're gonna go to break sam all right yeah we'll go to break 
[02:51:00]  but ask them nicely tell them it's not we're not trying to bump them we just physically need it  do they need that one or can they do it in the other way i mean we've heard some things we want  to just want to clear up you know clear the air here i'm the messenger uh with all due respect to  blah blah blah please shouldn't i talk to the program director yeah because around here the  host other than you guys just they don't do anything i mean they're not allowed to people  aren't allowed to just see how they feel about it yeah all right i don't even know where the 
[02:51:30]  program get the information i'll get the info get the info one way or the other get the low down  i'll have an update when you get the skinny all right we're gonna do a break here yeah  is this us i like this music open anthony trumpeters got lots of updates so let's start with steve  who left the studio as we go back on air holy shit all right what's up relax okay okay all right 
[02:52:00]  all right uh t-shirts for the homeless shopping spree you're in sorry um i spoke to the uh individual  who runs cosmo who we all know um we do we all know who we used to work with him is craig at uh  wa and w i like craig okay craig said if you're calling me to move this thing on friday the answer  is no we've been planning it for a month and a half you guys have been planning this for an hour and a  half he said but the reason is not no we've been planning ours for a really long time it's not to 
[02:52:30]  be dicks it's simply can they move to the other studio why no he said we're not moving it the  answer is no and it's a firm no don't ask that ain't happening yeah okay so cosmo we have requested  and they are just basically saying no all right fuck you do we did but did did did he say that they  couldn't because of logistics yeah he said logistically they have a stage they have uh a  fashion show they have trumpeters there's too much physical stuff and it's a move to a different 
[02:53:00]  studio like if on such short notice to to you know the stage guy's gonna come and the trumpeter guys  and yeah okay so the sweaters uh it looks like the things the thursday morning uh may be more of an  option the 6 to 10 a.m may be more of an option because i think that that cardinal thing may be a  rebroadcast so we'll see if that's actually rebroadcasting from the fishbowl uh yeah that's  what i don't understand see i don't know what they book these things for until we actually talk to 
[02:53:30]  talent that's why i was making sure liam didn't leave but um how how long would it take to find  out if it's taped or a real cardinal exactly you gotta find out from talent which is who just  all right go grab liam how complicated is this yeah go go go go find out and then we we sent sam  over to the cosmo studios we could so bump a cardinal tape and paint the picture sam what  happened i went to the studio straight to the source okay i went to the cosmo studio and we 
[02:54:00]  walked past and i went with troy because troy knows that an exact quote liam says steve doesn't know what  he's talking about great that's an exact quote yes sam let me be the liaison everybody okay um yes i  went to the studio with troy because troy knows more people than i do plus he's bigger than me  yeah so we went in well we went you know to the window yes and then poked our head through the door  thing and said come here and the intern who works there i know so she came out and the first thing 
[02:54:30]  she does with this hugely concerned look on her face is say don't fuck up my shit wow what are we  doing to her because apparently some of our uh uh listeners who mean well yeah have been bombarding  cosmo radio with phone calls oh no i want to make it perfectly clear because we'll get in trouble for  that too we had nothing to do with that we never said i want to go on record and say that i didn't  even think about that right so then uh troy and i say no no look we're not attacking anyone we just 
[02:55:00]  have this thing going on blah blah blah and we tell her and she goes okay well i'll talk to the host  they were still on the air though so we wait until the on-air light goes off yeah and then we kind of  poke our head in the window and they pretend not to see us so troy with some balls sticks his head  opens the door sticks his head in and says is it cool if we come in and then what of course they go  yeah come on in and they were pissed they were especially the chick you could see it in her eyes  like she had the like kind of teary pissed off eyes oh man like she wouldn't look at us and we were 
[02:55:30]  like yeah we're just doing this thing uh a show for the homeless that we've kind of they screwed up  our first bit charity and we were trying to do this and we wanted to know if we could on friday use  the space and she's like use what and we're like well the studio that you have which studio and he's  like the fishbowl no way no she was like wait that's our we kind of we've been promoting our thing  this is our thing we have a party going right kevin from jersey sweater party kevin from jersey 
[02:56:00]  goes uh sorry they're up uh jordan actually kevin you had a good answer feedback too jordan from  scranton writes if i were craig i don't know if i'd be proud of the fact that i that it took a month  and a half to plan a sweater show with trombone players they're all rusty trumpets  my teeth itch again i i've been sitting here by the way trying to figure out how to work a rusty  trombone line in and i couldn't and just neither could i apparently not jimmy but yeah both the 
[02:56:30]  girl and the guy board op said that there's no way that this could happen that they've been  promoting this this is their big thing this is their christmas party they've been promoting it for  a long time and they need they need the studio no way no way actually no way and when we walked in  troy introduced himself and said hi i'm troy from the opian anthony show and the guy who's the board  op said yeah i know who you are i've been your house a couple times oh shit oh shit oops okay well 
[02:57:00]  the cosmo channel all right they prefer not to give up their studio i mean if we need to talk to the  program director of cosmo face to face not on the phone we could go do that too well you can't  really fault the cosmo show i mean it's a goofy idea sweater thing going it doesn't make any sense  they have a runway that has to be constructed and brought in i gather they have trump trumpeters  and and sweaters what all the day are they going to do this well let's ask liam 
[02:57:30]  maybe the 20 listeners on cosmo have been looking forward to that let's ask liam i'll go i'll go find  all we need what yeah you go find liam here comes the look go find him and see if he's uh around  did you guys have fun with your exercise today how much are you looking forward to vacation  i will say this if they don't find a way to get this done with the money as a stake 
[02:58:00]  it's and i'm telling you this for the record it's the last time i will ever ever try to get something  pushed through i literally will lose all interest in in this company making a fucking dime well that's  anything i'm involved with i really will lose complete interest yeah that's the whole you know  gist of this thing is like let's see with our with our complete cooperation and um you know  brainstorming and willingness to switch and willingness to adapt how far this could go and 
[02:58:30]  it's we're running around uh well sam is like a chicken without a little head and um really nothing  getting accomplished it's fascinating well it's the corporate world it's the radio world what it's  become i i know we sound like broken records but this is a great exercise because now i see people  seriously running around like they don't even know what to do it's like if you kick an anthill  yeah yeah you see the ants going we know we have to do something but we don't know where to start 
[02:59:00]  that's what this environment has become because there's so many levels of management  yeah yeah it's just ridiculous look at the amount of people we've already had to run through  uh and and we're we're no closer uh what about the answer on the cardinal  is it a tape is it the card we can't even find that out is it the is it in the the the big  fishbowl we can't even find that out what would he be doing in the fishbowl how hard would that be 
[02:59:30]  to uh figure out is he doing a big pointy hat show what is going on here comes sam sam's back with some  more intel hi sam you're like a messenger news i'm a liaison yeah so the what we're looking at now  from liam is thursday except in the studio that you say you didn't want to be in the other  performance studio that's not the fishbowl right now because the fishbowl itself is not a studio  there's a studio connected to the fishbowl that allows you to broadcast within the fishbowl 
[03:00:00]  the studio that allows you to broadcast from the fishbowl the board that we need that is what is  being used to run a recording of the catholic show they have no other studio to run this recording  right now they're getting use our studio because we yes we won't be in here right now they're getting  well the thing is we would need to go from the board that is attached to the fishbowl being bumped for a 
[03:00:30]  tape into our board i would think wait a minute should i go ask liam how come the catholic channel  can't just broadcast out of our studio if it's a recording yeah exactly all right hey can i uh share  my uh very awkward moment i had in the bathroom by the way oh because i like to like well you always  thought you were bigger and i showed you that you weren't and it wasn't awkward for me dude i didn't  lose any respect for you it was cold on your side of the restroom so i like to let it all this 
[03:01:00]  believe it's from mark and so i like to let it all hang out speaking of bathrooms yes so one of  the suits in question one of the liaisons had the nerve to actually speak to me in the bathroom  i was like you're nuts to even say anything to me right now because i'm fucking all nerves  he goes uh for what it's worth uh this has just been a great hour and a half of radio even if it's  been at my expense oh and i said you know something i already know that i already know we do great  radio that's what we do great radio the problem is we need people around us that know how to help us 
[03:01:30]  do even better radio and slam a rooney and back down the hall to the studio oh that was the awkward  moment that went down oh don't tell me we do great radio i already know that oh boy awkward i already  know that that's not the problem that's never been the problem we want to be doing even better radio  and and believe it or not easier radio easier radio where it's it's not a chore to get this 
[03:02:00]  shit done all the time easy peasy Japanesey mm-hmm even if it's at my expense oh god i'm sorry to hear  about that that that'll be a i ain't doing no post meetings today oh no you don't have to i am going  to be eastbound and down it minutes after the uh mics go off please it's running around like crazy now 
[03:02:30]  so uh okay we we have the cardinal tape is that the cardinal tape is going to be played  from when to when that's friday night or thursday we can't have the studio because there's a  fucking tape yes being played a tape is going to be played on the board i like this you're joining my 
[03:03:00]  side that we would need took an hour but i knew how to get you how could we not guys have fun  i'll be honest priority over a tape how this works out is i want it to work out but if it doesn't  i will never from now until october my contract expires i will never try to push for you guys to  fucking do anything that's going to make money for the company again i really won't and i don't  give a fuck and if you pull my plugs i really don't care i will do nothing to try to help this 
[03:03:30]  fucking company make money other than show up and do my stupid job let it be known too on the way home  yesterday it was pretty intense in the car and jimmy was rah rah let's try to figure something out  and i said all right well we did and we did and i shouldn't have been thank you jimmy and that's what  i shouldn't have been that's why every discussion every discussion i've had in a meeting after i  just i shouldn't have been rah rah you know what i you're right you shouldn't have been and you were 
[03:04:00]  kind of getting frustrated at me and i understand you were frustrated me and i'm like jimmy i just  know how this should work for personal reasons i shouldn't have been i just need anthony and i got  the whole room come on it uh uh sam's back with another up there yes we're dealing with stairs  now too oh yeah you're going upstairs now that's really a multi-level thing yeah um just as i 
[03:04:30]  suspected because of the way our show is set up to broadcast we would need uh two boards to run out  of that studio we'd need the board that's connected to the fishbowl as well as our board  which means there would be no board left okay for the catholic okay how about the catholic channel  play the fucking tape next week but jimmy you were rah rah why can't they do that it's either i still  they won't tell me whether it's a tape or isdn tape it sounds like it's a tape but it has to be isdn 
[03:05:00]  and if the tape has to be isdn then you need a board if it's just a tape tape then you just put in  the system you don't need a board why why can't they figure out any other way  to broadcast that why can't someone just go to greenstein who's the president of the company  and say can you help us get this done yes or no he's the boss jimmy walk down the hall no i won't  i really we we won't no i really won't do it why don't you just ask i'm so happy this is going on 
[03:05:30]  because this is what we deal with this is for real what we deal with it's the it's it's no brainer  that they make so complicated because then you're not taking into account all the listeners of the  catholic channel i'm sure there's plenty of them i'm sure there are but uh what someone actually just  wrote what happened to the original mall bit are you kidding me are you kidding me i like that we're  giving an insight into what it's like to this is why i get a bit i come on tober it's exhausting i i  literally i never thought i'd be ready to leave radio but i really am i honest to god am ready to just 
[03:06:00]  fucking move on with my career i i have i have that little fun in this situation you were raw raw  yesterday jimmy for real though yeah why can't it be loaded into profit which is the system here the  recording system just like every other pre-recorded program on the entire platform that's how our  replays and ron and fez's uh replays are are played uh no no board needed no nothing why why does you  just read that yeah i i i i read it danny that guy what a fucking 
[03:06:30]  shirt on he looks scary i don't know who is he i'll ask him in a minute what does he do what  does that guy how is he fucking jimmy you were raw raw yesterday you understand i'm raw raw but you  understand the way i feel personally is fucking is completely laughing at i was just giving some  good information if you guys want i just found out this is very exciting for everybody but don wicklin  is in the building we could talk to him if you want who said that who fucking told you that 
[03:07:00]  travis why who cares that's true um does he run the catholic channel no not with his godless  lifestyle he doesn't oh my goodness that fucking sodomite oh wow  i guess this would be a fun time to i guess this would be a fun time uh okay uh i guess this  would be a fun time to read the email i got from um my agent last night oh cool i want to hear this 
[03:07:30]  kenny kenny's got kenny's got it out there i got a great idea this is the solution to everything  oh okay let's do it in washington dc at xm studios  i don't even know what to do with that i know the homeless people all used to work there  before the merger or was it a rape bob bob wrote me last night because he called and i couldn't get  to the phone so i said hey what's up he's fucking good and bob our agent last night uh this is a real 
[03:08:00]  email this one time jimmy nuts he writes yeah just want to hear if you have an update on the mall  situation did they secure the one that was left that's why i haven't talked to bob in over a week  and i'm going through jonathan now my manager i got no interest in working with him anymore  i really don't he let me get fucked here he let me get fucked  my god man in response to the initial question i think the taped show has to be isdn 
[03:08:30]  can i can i can i uh so the tape is at another location can i tag can i tag uh jimmy's bombshell  on that board yes i didn't say anything mars suggests i'm leaving radio i just want to tag your  bombshell with this there has to be some drastic changes in october i don't care about them or not  i've stopped having fun doing or i'm with you and that's my bombshell today i fucking uh  uh mars what do you have with the situation situation that is then isdn situation let me 
[03:09:00]  see your abs it could uh no no no too much cake yeah too much cake yeah anyway um they could have  the isdn coming into this room and we could uh cdr it off in here we could swap just this room they  could still use why won't they do that i don't know so the recording is at another location so there's a  a cardinal tape somewhere at the other end of an isdl on miles away even and it runs into here 
[03:09:30]  at a certain time can't they mail the fucking tape that we play from here yes it sounds like  they're going to run a taped show via isdn live where is the tape show i don't know but it would  your solution of just getting a copy of the tape show before live yeah yeah then it could run from  anywhere why can't they do that guys opi's initial thing lazy okay hey lazy is going to be uh the 
[03:10:00]  answer you know that uh-oh now to add a little more to this keith the cop on line 10 let's go to uh  keith how are you sir how are those uh tread marks because you got thrown under a fucking bus yesterday  the bottom of that bus look i did you get some blame yesterday i just woke up what the  fuck are we doing what are we doing are you kidding me what are we doing see keith um what happened was 
[03:10:30]  uh there's no mall availability uh so we decided which was sort of blamed on which is keith's fault  by the way of course for handling it like he had handled it all the previous years of  fucking it up uh by the numbers if you remember uh the thousands of people the happy homeless the  great content on radio that was all keith's fuck up by the way uh everybody i apologize yeah yeah and  you well you should uh and we heard it yesterday that it was indeed keith's fault uh that this didn't 
[03:11:00]  happen this year so anyway with that whole shopping spree shenanigans well behind us we decided we'll  move on and do something for the homeless make some entertaining radio and uh keep the sponsors  involved by doing a homeless talent show now we would take our show into the big fishbowl in the lobby  have a live audience of about 20 25 people like the good old days at xm uh in that big space in the 
[03:11:30]  chairs we would then host the whole thing judge the contest and the homeless would sing dance comedy  whatever they could do uh and we would give them money for it and everyone has fun it would be  fun content uh we would talk to listeners again that was always fun and things like that so we've been  trying to get this uh uh uh green lit as they say for uh quite a while now today and uh we're just kind  of being blocked at every turn because this this fishbowl is being used on all the times that we can 
[03:12:00]  uh do this program we might do it from this studio uh uh well i already see problem number one uh-huh  which i've experienced a couple times in the last couple weeks when i've been bringing the homeless  up there yeah see we can't get to the fishbowl from the front desk because the twat that sit  i'll show you the dumped dumped dumped i got it i got it good keith i was an adam bomb brother yeah  come on adam bomb watch that it's very difficult to move around the uh there's some corporate 
[03:12:30]  shit going on where you can't just bring homeless through the front door that's what i had to say  yeah yeah yeah i i i get i i i don't understand that though why can't you just bring homeless people  through the front oh no i didn't even mean that but like the other day i came in for a meeting  and uh the meeting was in progress and i went to the desk and then uh i need to go to to this  meeting it's down the hall see that room down there i will have to call somebody to get to find out if  you're in the meeting well you can't call them in their office because they're in the meeting well i 
[03:13:00]  have to call their office and leave a message and when they get the message then they'll come and get  you but they're all in the meeting they're right there in the in the room it took me 20 minutes  to get into the room to get into a room that you were looking right into right that i was a part of  that meeting and you were part of the meeting right yes that's how that's just more that's just more  weird corporate stuff that's how it works i'll never understand that well well that now that now  that's the the newest idea we came up with but uh apparently it seems the cosmo channel has the um 
[03:13:30]  the fishbowl book to do a uh christmas sweater uh fashion show with trumpeters and a uh runway kind  of walkway thing and then uh the other day we have available uh apparently the cardinal is running a  taped program that has to be run through the board that the fishbowl uses so we can't use that  and i don't know why they can't just run a tape from somewhere else  and and doing it in any other way shape or form without the live audience without that interaction 
[03:14:00]  and and without a larger space than our studio is uh a futile i don't know why we just couldn't go  shopping well yeah yeah that um boy we accomplished a lot today well keep uh i don't know why we  couldn't go shopping either apparently you uh did uh something wrong what uh that was good big was it  was it uh those big double tires that went over you yesterday or were they just single rear wheels 
[03:14:30]  from your from where you stand what went wrong with the homeless shopping spree because they said you  did exactly what you've done in past years and uh the climate has changed out there that's sort of  what was told to me yeah they were following keith's lead is what they said i mean we are we uh in in the  past when this first started we we gave no heads up when we were in any w we know and i mean when we  we the first time we just went the second time uh the police department had a little bit of a  clue we were coming just from the general talk and stuff like that but the mall manager when i got there 
[03:15:00]  was pissed he wouldn't even talk to me uh you know and then the in the past couple years at xm  the local police department knew because uh of things but we never went and asked for permission no  no we never went and asked for permission and we went met the security out of uh a courtesy the  last couple you know a couple times but as soon as you know the x as soon as the xm started to open 
[03:15:30]  the mouth it all went back to insurance papers and that and of course you know everyone's passing  when you when you tell somebody hey we're coming here we're gonna fuck up your day and we'll  um when we walk out well you're you're responsible you can't do it oh just  fucking embarrassing embarrassing but jimmy no i mean with what he's talking about but you think i  don't know dude if you knew that i know the dealings i've had i know you know holy  shit i do know you know horrendous i mean we we did the the fellow from promotions that i went out with  he did do uh his best job with it but when it when it it went when it came back around hold on but 
[03:16:00]  logically that scenario that's where we should have said you know what this we can't do this  then no one's gonna agree to these terms can i go to the cosmo fashion show though instead of the  you know how about we have the homeless guys wear the sweaters for the cosmo people and we'll broadcast  together across promotion i think he's promotion burned your bridges at cosmo we didn't even burn a bridge  we asked him nicely you know we weren't yelling screaming at him at all we were very professional 
[03:16:30]  it got too corporate it got too pc i mean in the meeting one of the things that was brought up to  me was hey uh legal wants to make sure that the homeless understand that when we get back to the  city um we're not bringing them back to where we pick them up they have to know this and i go  that's okay i go you know why because they're fucking homeless when we get back to the city  they're fucking home home it's the city home at the mall too because they don't have a  fucking home they're homeless yeah in past years some of the guys said you know what i'm hanging 
[03:17:00]  out at the mall for a while it seems pretty warm in here it's fine oh my god that's it they're  homeless we don't have to go to we don't have to bring them back all right well thank you keith  they are blaming you though yeah yeah well maybe well we'll we'll get we'll get back to you  immediately when we know oh you got an update i have an update all right from our uh legal liaison  legal liaison earlier this morning uh the one that green lit the whole thing he wasn't able to  green light it but is it baking but i thought wait no no i heard the legal oh no everything's fine 
[03:17:30]  the legal side yes you're right but it's fine legally all right and our legal liaison yeah believes  that we will have good news later on today he just needs to touch base with a few more people  about the lawyers in general i asked if there was more specific information to be given and  he said there was not what is this d-day what the fuck is this hey look i want to get it done 
[03:18:00]  well let's get this done let's get this done let's make this work come on everybody it looks  on pull together gonna happen okay all right pull this together good then i haven't lost interest in  the fishbowl um not confirmed we still need to touch base on that that's something we might have to  work through offline why are you guys believing in anything oh there is no santa claus santa gonna  come down and get your presents as long as i'm good i mean i went to did what you guys said yes you did 
[03:18:30]  you're very good wasn't naughty well now what are we doing we're good i guess we're leaving everybody uh  hanging here what a cliffhanger we'll we'll know uh tomorrow uh tomorrow perhaps can we have homeless  people in this thing wow find out tomorrow on the next does steve have an update no what do you what  yes do you have anything it's really just a question unclipped much better if you're gonna ruin it um 
[03:19:00]  thank you just sorry that's all right that's a good one thank you it's like you just started radio it's  weird good steve should show his abs no hi sam because i don't have them um it's really like  sam said it's really just a question of where because all this you know all these uh different  shows have to be uh have to be met with and everybody has to decide whether where they're  willing to move and where they could move uh pre-taped or taped steve talks like one of them 
[03:19:30]  yeah he is one of them i am thank you wow you're a suit man next to the bean pod all right yep i'm  done i have nothing else to say until we figure out what's going on yeah what else is there don't  go home with hope i don't have hope oh god is that i'm trying to do this i'm trying not to quit  that should be that should be hung up everywhere in this building don't go home with hope that's  the wrong idea holy shit is that the perfect line i'm the yogi burr of radio trust me you guys just 
[03:20:00]  don't know it yet that should be a banner like of what is it good for the company don't go home with  hope i want to i want the fucking listeners to come up with not a shitty a really nice don't go home  with hope sign that we could hang up over that door do we need it i want to be reminded every  fucking day just to look at it and go yes why did i hope for a second i was i was optimistic every  meeting i had every fucking meeting i had hey you know maybe hey maybe hey nothing nothing yeah 
[03:20:30]  negativity only breeds negativity not at all not when you've been when you've been you've shown  positivity and got nothing but negativity in return then negativity is just i was insulted by uh i was  insulted by hearing that you say that there's a lot of negativity revolving around the fucking radio  show the whole company hates us we all know that i was insulted to hear that because it's like  don't they understand the frustration there was less anger in here when i was  backing the nazis wow let's get things done you didn't you didn't fucking see goebbels asking 
[03:21:00]  hitler look blue sky this where's iraq i just fucking rubbed my ball bag on this shirt it should  be worth something online now i want this shirt iraq collector's item in it we can't sell those  shirts they got sponsor logos on them who would sell them well i mean we can't give them away  i'm gonna wear them around the house wait wait wait wait wait whoa whoa whoa wait wait wait wait  we have 200 t-shirts that are collectors i have now for real my twitter did explode because i put a 
[03:21:30]  picture up and everyone's like i want one of those because now it's it's it's become like  fucking famous the shirt and this whole thing we're not allowed to give the shirts to listeners  why can't we give them away no um i was instructed uh yesterday afternoon that the company will be  taking the shirts back and locking them away for now now why wait wait i want to know why there is  an issue there's sponsor logo well it doesn't matter the sponsor logo so what's the problem  they just they don't want the shirts going out to the public with the sponsor logos on them since 
[03:22:00]  the event isn't happening because if the sponsors haven't paid everything what then we're giving  people t-shirts free advertising and they don't want to company doesn't want the sponsors that's  not to get free you guys are now being silly no we were instructed well so the company doesn't want  the sponsors getting the advertising on these shirts we were actually asked to give the staff  shirts back yeah and i'm leaving with my shirt i'm selling it they didn't do too good a job because uh 
[03:22:30]  we came in this morning and that first box is wide open and people just were helping themselves  we were told that there would be somebody coming by to pick up the boxes and we responded that when  the person arrives did not to worry because the boxes would be much much lighter than they were  yes because everyone wants these shirts now that that's that was not a real conversation yes it was  no no stop it just stop now you guys are totally goofing on us i wouldn't lie you saw how we react  to to the company goings-on and you thought this will be funny let's tell them that we can't give
