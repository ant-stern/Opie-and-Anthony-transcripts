<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the repeated airing of the FEMA website address, followed by a discussion of Anthony's son's birthday and a chaotic Mother's Day dinner at "The Snapper," a seafood restaurant where his nephew demanded car keys. Anthony detailed using large tips to placate stressed waitstaff.  He then vented about his allergist's refusal to renew his allergy prescriptions without an office visit, using profane language to express his frustration.  This segued into a humorous critique of his experience at a communion service, mocking the haphazard distribution of holy water and the bland communion wafers. He further recounted humorous anecdotes, including a left-handed priest’s erratic sprinkling of holy water and his overall skepticism towards organized religion. The hosts then reacted to the death of Osama bin Laden, contrasting their expectations of a technologically advanced hideout with the squalid reality, and joked about Bin Laden’s purported erectile dysfunction and potential outtakes from his propaganda videos.  They also criticized Bob Costas's Kentucky Derby introduction and showcased photos of their Derby outfits.

The show continued with further discussion of the Kentucky Derby, focusing on humorous anecdotes about large hats causing face-whippings and logistical challenges like long lines for beer and bathrooms. One host described a frustrating search for off-track betting in Hempstead, NY, comparing the area to "The Wire in 3D."  The hosts criticized Michael Moore and Rosie O’Donnell’s reactions to Bin Laden’s death, deeming their opinions delusional.  They played a clip of a child praising Jesus on public access television, mentioned upcoming guest Larry King, and promised to ask him about his grocery shopping habits. A significant portion focused on the public reaction to Bin Laden's death, contrasting celebratory responses with critical viewpoints and criticizing perceived overreactions to the celebrations. The hosts also discussed a supposedly stolen SNL bit about podiums and a poor-quality Foghorn Leghorn voice in a commercial. A caller, initially identified as Jim then corrected to Ian, offered his perspective on Michael Moore’s stance, sparking a discussion about US history and moral complexities.  The segment concluded with excitement over Larry King’s upcoming appearance and a mention of Adam Baldwin following a host on Twitter.

The next segment covered a variety of topics, including a hypothetical superhero movie with a power-copying villain, Gene Simmons' lawsuit against a kid for a denial-of-service attack, and observations about a photograph of Obama.  They briefly mentioned Chris Hemsworth's appearance on Sam Roberts' segment, the Mavericks sweeping the Lakers in hockey, and a dislocated elbow in a Celtics-Heat game.  The conversation shifted to the death of Seve Ballesteros, Paul McCartney's engagement to Nancy Shevell (with graphic descriptions of a photograph and speculation about her age and wealth), and a heated exchange with a caller who negatively reviewed Opie's brother's restaurant.  They discussed a Hasidic newspaper photoshopping women out of a Situation Room photo, including a phone call with a listener in Israel explaining the newspaper's policy. The segment also covered Pete Best's post-Beatles career, a caller providing details about Nancy Shevell’s background, opinions on the attractiveness of various celebrities (including Jennifer Aniston), a listener-submitted clip of possibly stolen SNL material, a planned Pocono Raceway event, a photoshopped image of Opie’s speeding car, and a pillow fight between Kathy Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb. The segment ended with a mention of a contest winner whose name was not announced.  Throughout, numerous crude jokes and sexually explicit comments were made.

The show then featured an in-studio interview with Larry King.  The segment began with the conclusion of a contest for "Most Annoying 30 Seconds of Audio," with a $2,000 prize from Steven Singer Jewelers, though the winner’s announcement was delayed until the next day. Larry King discussed his career, starting with his first radio job in 1957 in Miami, his chosen name, and early experiences. He recounted anecdotes about Jackie Gleason and his interviewing style, focusing on letting the guest speak and asking simple questions.  He mentioned his marriages and current family life. A significant portion involved a clip of a past interview where King asked a rape victim about groceries before the assault.  They revisited this question, with King explaining his investigative style and desire for a complete picture.  They discussed the criticism generated by this question. The conversation also touched upon his comedy tour, his views on other comedians (Mel Brooks, Don Rickles, Chris Rock, Seinfeld, Larry David, Lenny Bruce), and his departure from CNN, listing many comedy tour dates.

The final segment was a post-interview discussion about Larry King.  The hosts discussed their evolving relationship, noting the changes in their lives and the differences between their current and earlier broadcasts. They reflected on King's candidness about his marriages and his ability to deflect awkward questions, including a bizarre question about missing groceries and another about the importance of a skateboard. They mentioned King’s wit and nonchalance towards their attempts to steer the conversation. They reminisced about past experiences, near misses, and regretted decisions. The segment concluded with a mention of Eastside Dave's Mother’s Day video and an upcoming contest winner announcement.  The hosts expressed their enjoyment of the interview despite some perceived awkward moments, using significant offensive language throughout.

[00:05:00]  It's kind of odd  She gave birth on Mother's Day last year  Yeah  And my kid's birthday is today  Yeah.  Happy first.  Happy one.  To the little guy.  Happy one.  You know what's fucked up about that?  He's already had his first cake at my brother's house over the weekend.  Yeah.  They brought out a little tiny cake for the kid.  Yeah.  He knew exactly what that was.  How is that possible?  Kids and cake?  Yeah.  But at one?  I don't know.  Because he hasn't seen that before for himself.  Yeah.  But all of a sudden they bring it out from the kitchen. 
[00:05:30]  You know, we all know the deal.  Oh, the excitement.  Hey, why don't you go distract him?  We're going to like the candles now.  Make believe he has a phone call in the other room.  A phone call.  All that crap.  Yeah, yeah.  He's one.  If the family's together.  I'm not even talking about my one year old.  I'm just talking in general.  If your family's together and it's about your birthday.  Yeah.  Is there really going to be a surprise happening when you bring out the cake?  You get like a.  Hey, get in the living room. 
[00:06:00]  We're going to like the cake now.  And then the lights start going down.  Yeah.  I go, oh, I didn't see this coming.  My birthday tomorrow.  Wasn't expecting this at the big family get together.  But they pull that tiny little cake out with one candle on it.  And he knew exactly what that was about.  What is it?  In your DNA?  I guess it is as a kid.  I don't get it.  I just kind of know what good kids stuff is.  Yeah.  Sweet cakey stuffs.  Did you do anything for your mom yesterday?  Yeah.  We went out to the Snapper down there on the South Shore. 
[00:06:30]  The Snapper.  What the hell is the Snapper?  It's a seafood kind of steaky seafood place in Oakdale.  Nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was nice.  Went out there.  On the water?  Yep.  Nice.  Right there on the water in Oakdale.  Very cool.  And yeah, Joe and Dawn and, you know, a little Warren.  A little Warren Dean and a little Layla.  They're not little anymore.  How old are they?  They're like frigging two, three.  Oh, okay.  What the hell are they?  No, they're just a little. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  I thought you were going to say 12 and 14.  No, but they're yapping like crazy and, you know, walking around.  The kids?  Yeah.  They're like, they're more people than baby now, you know?  Mm-hmm.  Because they start talking and things like that.  Right.  And they identify things.  And like you said, even a one-year-old that knows like that good stuff, like, forget it.  Once they hit their twos and shit, then they know everything.  Yeah.  It's like, oh, that's good.  That stuff's shit.  Right.  I don't like that.  I'm not going to eat that.  I'll eat that a little bit.  So Warren's, my little nephew, my sister, Dawn and Patrick's kid, and my little godson, 
[00:07:30]  he comes up to me and he's like, Uncle Anthony, give me the keys to your car.  You little fucker.  Hey, I can't even say it.  Really?  I want the Chevy.  Oh, that's great.  Give me the Chevy.  He calls it the Chevy.  The Chevy.  And, of course, I tossed him the keys.  He took it around for a little while.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  Took it for a spit.  You've got to let the kid have what he wants.  They've got to start early. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Did that.  Uh-huh.  You know, that was fun.  And then the other two kids, Mom and Sal.  Oh, really?  Trying to deal with them.  I was waiting.  You know, because you get Warren running around the tables and shit and doing all the stuff  kids do that I freak out about.  Yeah.  And I'm like, I'm like on, I just see the waiters with hot things of coffee.  At any moment, something bad can happen.  It's just like, just put the kid in the seat, please.  Welcome to the life of a parent.  You only have to worry about that every once in a while. 
[00:08:30]  I know.  That's every day.  Thank God.  I look around and I'm like.  That's every day.  I'm slipping the waitress like a C-note just going, look, I understand.  I'm sorry.  I'm apologizing with money.  I'm just like, here, take this so I can, you know, sit here and not be kicked out.  That's your thing, though.  You throw money at things hoping it goes away.  Please make this go away.  I would like, you know what?  After the bill, I wanted to stay.  You would be a great parent, man.  Oh, just take care of this, huh?  Right.  And I wanted to, you know, have another espresso with a little Sambuca, nice guinea wop thing 
[00:09:00]  to do after dinner.  But the bill had come already.  It was paid.  And I know the kids were, you know, running around and the waiters and waitresses were  kind of, you know, it's a lot of work for waiters and waitresses that have been there  the entire day.  Right, right.  We were like the last table to leave.  And Mother's Day, you know, it's packed and everything.  So I just felt compelled.  I'm like, here, you just go, dude, whatever the bill is for the espresso and stuff, me and 
[00:09:30]  my brother and shit like that.  I'm just like, here, take this.  And I understand.  Enjoy.  It's Mother's Day.  I'm sorry.  But you skipped over.  Your mom and Sal are becoming kids.  Oh, now they're just, you know, kids.  Like, yes, Sal, we'll take that.  See, and then it's like, you know, Patrick at one point was like, I was all inclusive,  the menu, you know?  Yeah.  It's like, you know, I don't want an appetizer because I really don't want an appetizer.  And that caused confusion like a shuttle launch.  What?  It's included.  Well, and then trying to explain to Sal that, well, you can get two appetizers. 
[00:10:00]  Now, because Patrick doesn't want one.  Wait, why do I get two?  No, no.  See, Patrick didn't get his.  And then I'm just like, maybe Patrick should just order one.  And then he's like, Sal, well, what do you want?  Because I'll just give it to you.  I don't think I could get two.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Look, now he's up running around the table.  Sal, sit down.  I think you enter this world as a kid and you leave this world as a kid.  And you just leave it as a child. 
[00:10:30]  Absolutely.  It was just insanity.  Well, that's great.  I just want to acknowledge allergies.  Oh, yeah.  You got it.  I heard you.  You're pretty stuffy this morning.  I want to acknowledge allergies because I know there's others out there.  I like relating to the people.  Other suffering.  Well, that green shit that you see on everything is death for a lot of us.  When you get in your car and you start backing out the driveway and you look at your hood and go, what the fuck?  Did it snow last night?  What is that stuff?  It's everywhere.  Oh, fuck, man. 
[00:11:00]  It's been a rough three days.  A green death.  I've tried everything.  And then I got medicine head because I tried everything just to get it out of my system.  Yeah.  Because we had a busy weekend.  What did you try?  A little oxy.  Sure.  A little fucking higher on.  Finally, a few beers, actually.  Just a couple of beers.  Just to numb everything.  Yeah, I'll do it.  Then you don't give a fuck.  You're sneezing every 30 seconds.  Yeah.  Look at my face.  This is an allergy face.  My eyes are shut.  Between a cold and an allergy, because I had the cold last week, you have the allergy going. 
[00:11:30]  Right.  Is there nothing fucking worse than blowing your nose and having it clear for exactly three seconds?  Isn't that the greatest feeling ever, though?  It's like, for three seconds, you're like, ah, and then it's, where did the snot come from?  But as soon as you get that clear passage, you're just in heaven.  That's all you want from life.  Oh.  But this fucking allergy season, I tweeted about it, and some people said in their area, I'm not sure exactly where, the shelves were empty.  Really?  That's how bad it is.  People are just grabbing everything they can. 
[00:12:00]  Or making crystal meth.  Oh, but I know.  Apparently that's a good ingredient.  Yeah, because you got to, there's a lot of allergy medications you do have to sign for now.  Yeah, now you got to sign for it.  But what does that fucking mean anyway?  I know.  It's like, stop.  First of all, that should only be a law south of the Mason-Dixon line.  Sure.  I don't think anybody up here is really cooking up meth these days.  Right, right, right.  And my fucking allergist could go suck a fucking big fat cock.  Ooh.  Is he gay?  I don't know.  Oh.  I'm going to say that. 
[00:12:30]  I don't know.  And now I'm going to give his name out, the piece of shit.  He's one of these doctors.  So obviously, I went last year, and I got all the shit I need.  He prescribed this.  It's better than Claritin-D.  I got the nose spray.  I got all this crap.  I got something I can take during the day, something that I take at night, so it opens up the  passageway so I can sleep properly, right?  Yeah.  So I run out of all this shit, and I don't even think about it, because it's only like  May that really kills me, and then it goes away, and I don't even think.  So you don't need it. 
[00:13:00]  So I go to my pharmacist, and I want to get all these prescriptions renewed.  They're like, oh, yeah, the prescriptions ran out.  We're going to have to call your urologist.  I'm like, okay, I'm sure he's one of these cool doctors where he'll just go, oh, yeah,  I know exactly what this is, no problem.  They call me back a few hours later, and they go, oh, yeah, he denied rewriting him.  He wants to see you.  What could have changed in a year except you need a couple fucking hundred bucks off me?  He needs a couple of bucks for the insurance company?  For a fucking doctor's visit. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, the insurance company has to.  So guess who's not my fucking allergist anymore?  Time to find a new one that understands this shit.  I don't have time to go to his office, and it's not just a quick visit.  You sit in the waiting room for an hour, and then you go into the other room for an hour,  and then finally they see you.  For what?  So he could get a few bucks off me?  So how are you feeling?  Let me see.  Yeah, it's allergies.  Right.  Let me write you some prescriptions.  It's the same shit as last year.  There's nothing that could have changed. 
[00:14:00]  I had all the tests, and I learned that I'm allergic to trees and grass.  And you might ask, what kind of trees, Hope?  What kind of grass?  No, trees and grass.  In general.  Across the board.  You're allergic to what amounts to the planet Earth.  Yes.  You can't really live on this planet without having an allergy.  I'm allergic to the Earth's hair.  Anything that protrudes from the Earth, you're allergic to.  So why the fuck does he need to see me again?  For the insurance money.  That's all.  That's it.  You scumbag. 
[00:14:30]  And I'm like, really?  And then I called the guy to get him on the phone and bitched to him personally, but I  couldn't get him.  So I had his receptionist on.  And then I was curious.  Like, hey, he says he needs to see me.  Yeah, we could fit you in next Tuesday.  I'm like, I'm dying right now.  How about, yeah, you fit me in now if I have to come in?  Needless to say, he's not myologist anymore.  He could go fuck himself.  And I got all my medications.  Oh, nice.  By the way, of course, there's always ways around shit. 
[00:15:00]  So goodbye to you, asshole.  Good.  I know he listens to the show.  Goodbye to you.  Meth lab blew up on Long Island like two weeks ago.  Really?  Well, fuck me running.  I guess I I'll find the if you want to find the article.  But like, the entire house blew up.  I'm sure it was a biker gang.  Well, now we know why that aisle at the Dwayne Reed had nothing.  Right, right.  Did you come in wearing your colors and a bandana around your head?  Because I think biker gangs are the only ones really making it.  And I had to I was part of a communion this weekend. 
[00:15:30]  And I was telling you before the show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And people I don't I don't know what I believe after we're we're done here.  I do know this, that I'm I'm having a really fucking tough time with organized religion.  Are you are you troubled and toiling?  Not even over religion.  Not even toiling.  Not even troubled.  But that organized part of it is really fucking strange.  Yeah.  I like disorganized religion where they just throw communion wafers around and you try to 
[00:16:00]  grab them out of midair.  I would join that disorganized religion.  I would kind of join that.  And my little niece.  Oh, you yell pull and they shoot it out of a thing and you have to catch it in your mouth.  Like one of those fucking shirt guns.  It's all willy nilly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, speaking of willy nilly, the priest, there's a couple of things I want to say.  He touched willy nilly.  But you said willy nilly.  So I'll say this.  You know, when they go down the aisle and all of a sudden they have to sprinkle holy water.  Yeah.  What if you're not hit with the holy water?  What does that mean?  That's very willy nilly the way they do that. 
[00:16:30]  Because I would like to get a little drip.  And when you feel a little like, oh, OK, he hit me with that.  Right.  And he was a good and he was a left handed priest, which we all know left handers are, you know,  there's something, you know, it was an it's an evolution thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Left handers are going away.  So you're a little weaker than the right handers.  And you're fucking giving out the holy water with that weird southpaw style.  Southpaw style.  You got it.  He went sidearm southpaw.  Yeah.  And I didn't get fucking hit with water.  So what does that mean?  You got to go midway into the pew with a southpaw because he's going to launch over 
[00:17:00]  the front of the row.  But he's like this.  The row.  All willy nilly.  Like you get some knuckleball.  You get some holy water.  You.  Did you at least get some incense smoke?  And then he's like, no, man.  You didn't get any incense smoke either?  No, man.  I feel bad when I don't get the smoke.  When they walk down the aisle and they're waving that lantern with the smoke coming out  of it.  What religion is that?  Is that the Catholics?  Yeah, the Catholics do that.  I think that's a funeral, though.  Because I, you know, believe it or not, I go to I go to church more than people realize. 
[00:17:30]  Really?  There's always somebody getting a communion, a fucking water on the head.  Well, that's well, I want a water head.  Right.  Right.  Water on the head.  Right.  The Christening.  Yeah.  As long as the water is outside the head, you're OK.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Once it's inside, there's a problem.  Sorry.  What am I doing?  I'm sorry.  That's hell on earth.  I'm sorry.  I understand.  I'm sorry to you people.  It's.  But anyway, my my little niece, it was her communion and I got a brother who's a shut  in.  So I had to like step up and be one of the guys that, you know, walks her up the aisle. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  I'm not the godfather.  Somebody else in my family is.  But I don't know.  They were too busy doing whatever they do.  And I was telling you before the show, it's like a cult.  Even.  Oh, yeah.  Even like the Catholic religion.  Like, that's one of the biggies.  Like.  Oh, yeah.  That's a top.  That's one of the big religions.  Top three, I would say.  So all the little kids are walking up to receive communion for the first time.  Those weird wafers that taste like nothing.  The waffer.  You think after all these years, they would update the taste of the wafer to make them 
[00:18:30]  like berry.  Have like the crunch berries in them or something.  Something.  Yeah.  Why not?  Honey nut.  I think Jesus liked to eat.  Yeah.  So why?  Why does his body have to be so bland?  Right.  Something.  Cinnamon toast wafer.  Why not?  I would dig that.  Vanilla.  Yeah.  Vanilla's a safe.  Vanilla.  That's a safe flavor, right?  Whatever they flavor Apple Jacks with would be great.  Oh, my God.  Pumpkin spice, Jesus.  Pumpkin spice, Jesus.  I hate pumpkin spice.  Pumpkin spice.  Kashi.  Kashi wafers.  Right. 
[00:19:00]  Why not?  But why not?  Why not?  Why does it have to always be so fucking bland?  It's like cardboard.  And boring.  It's like thin, thin cardboard.  And monotone.  Why can't we have a little fun in church?  Then maybe you bring in some of the utes.  Eat my body.  Drink my blood.  Right.  Body, body, dog.  How come sometimes he talks, too?  It's like, you know, and now we will present the Holy Communion. 
[00:19:30]  Lord God, please accept this.  I don't understand why the singing sometimes.  Yeah, because honestly, does God or Jesus, does he go, you're not singing it.  I ain't hearing it.  If you ain't singing it, I ain't hearing it.  This is what makes it scary, by the way. 
[00:20:00]  This puts the fear of God into you.  Right.  The singing part.  But this was just the music genre when it all started.  Yeah.  If Jesus was walking around today, we'd have a hip-hop fucking service.  That's like a pop hit back in the day.  Right.  Yeah.  I'm telling you, that's all that's based on.  That was Justin Bieber.  Absolutely.  Of the day.  Justin Bieber, V...  I don't know.  I want to do a Roman numeral joke, but I fucking suck at it.  B-C... 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  Let's see.  V-E-X-X.  Justin Pius...  Justin...  Fucking...  Justin...  Justinus Bieberus.  Justin...  There you go.  There's the joke.  Now we can move on.  All right.  So I'm walking...  It was my turn to walk my niece up with my sister, and the lady who's in charge, she's  like, okay, put your right hand on her shoulder.  All right.  And then my sister had to put her left hand on her right shoulder, I guess. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  So now we're like...  I guess we're supposed to be guiding her?  Symbolically, you're guiding her toward the religion and Jesus.  Right.  But I was feeling like we're...  They recruited us to fucking recruit the little ones.  Give them the push.  And give them the push toward the priest and the wafer.  Holy shit.  There was no guidance.  It was like, this is going to be okay.  You'll be okay.  Don't worry about it.  Because two trusted people now...  Right.  ...are sending her into this religion.  What's...  That's no different than some of the fucking cults you hear about. 
[00:21:30]  Of course.  Where, fast forward, they're all wearing sneakers and they're dead.  Cutting their nuts off or drinking Kool-Aid and laying down.  What's the difference?  Yeah.  Setting a fucking Waco compound on fire.  Why not...  The kids are, what, 11-ish, I think?  I'm trying to think.  About 11.  So why do they need that push or that guidance?  Yeah.  They have brains themselves, so you line them up.  And if one of those kids goes, fuck this, and runs for a side door, then so be it.  You ain't going anywhere.  No, we're going to push you toward the front of the church. 
[00:22:00]  This is just fine.  Don't you worry about this.  Come with us.  Come play with us, Danny.  I kind of felt that way.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Kind of pushing the kid in there.  It was a happy day for her.  Well, of course.  She got to wear her little dress.  You don't want to ruin it by having a few beers and going, you know, all this is bullshit.  Little kid's like, yeah, I'm feeling all full of life and Jesus and everything.  And Uncle Lopey's wrecking the whole goddamn thing.  I'm with Troy on this one.  I got questions.  Conspiracy's going on in the religion? 
[00:22:30]  I got questions.  You think there is?  But I don't think it's up to me to, you know, you got to kind of push these little fuckers  forward and then let them figure it out later on.  Yeah.  That's my thought on the whole thing.  Let them have their own questions eventually.  Yeah, eventually they'll say.  You got to at least push them down the path and then see what happens.  Like, they don't teach them about, like, zombie Jesus that early, do they?  Oh, I think they do.  Zombie Jesus.  That he died and then he, like, rolls a stone away and comes back to life.  Yeah, that's possible.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that happens.  And the kids don't go like, hell the fuck does that happen? 
[00:23:00]  I'll tell you this much.  If you have a good priest that can kind of talk off the cuff, then I don't mind going.  You need a priest that can work the crowd?  Work the crowd.  You need kind of a Rich Voss.  A Rich Voss.  Can Rich Voss work a crowd?  Father Voss.  We like to beat him up.  But can that guy work a crowd?  Rich would make a great priest.  Okay.  He can work a crowd.  But when you got these just milk toast, run-of-the-mill priests that just have nothing, then it's  a complete waste of time.  Pontius Pilate wants me flogged, so I'm dodging him. 
[00:23:30]  Right.  But if a guy could get up there and kind of just fucking talk to the people for, you  know, what is it, that part's maybe 10 minutes, maybe?  Yeah.  That's all right.  But you don't find many of those guys is the problem.  The Baptists don't like to eat the coochie.  But I will.  Because the damn Filipinos are taking over the churches.  I don't know what the fuck half these guys are saying.  Yeah, I had one priest.  He said, body of crite all day.  What the hell is a body of crite?  Body of crite. 
[00:24:00]  Really?  I'm not joking.  Yeah.  I think I told that story.  It was a Christmas mass I went to down in Philly.  Christmas mass?  And the guy the whole time was going, here's the body of crite.  Body of crite.  So am I in the wrong fucking religion now?  Because I took the body of crite?  Is Jesus going to understand that?  I sure hope so.  And I hope Jesus understands that I wanted some of that holy water, but the stupid South  Paul priest didn't hit me with any.  So what the fuck does that mean in the end?  You have a lot of questions.  I got questions.  You got a lot of questions. 
[00:24:30]  I'm a Troy Kwan on this one.  I got questions.  Nah, it's just the organized part that's a little weird for me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't usually go.  Like, I do go for events, like you said.  Right.  But I don't have that many events, like now.  There's an occasional christening, some communions, things like that.  Right.  But they're few and far between.  And that's pretty much the only time I go.  Right.  A funeral, obviously.  Right.  I'm going to sit there, which, those are just fucking, ugh.  Well, it depends who dies. 
[00:25:00]  All the people die, and it's a party.  Yeah, that's true.  I'm not even joking.  It's a party.  Yeah, you're right.  You're right.  You get back to the house, and you're just like, ah.  And why can't we upgrade the wake food?  I was just thinking of this over the weekend.  Yeah?  Yeah, when you go to a wake, and then you got to go to someone's house in between, like,  I don't know, the wake fucking.  Wake food.  Showings, whatever.  It's always some shitty sub.  Yeah, they get the long, the six foot, uh, hero.  Why is it, like, uh, Thanksgiving, you got an aunt or somebody that brings their special 
[00:25:30]  dish, but for weeks, they don't bring the special dish.  Maybe she's the one that died.  So you got the shitty food.  Yeah.  That's what, we can upgrade.  We usually have some good stuff, though.  No matter what?  Yeah, the, uh, the kumi, uh, kind of, uh, and then my mom's side of the family.  My mom's side of the family, really.  They know how to cook?  They do a good spread on the, uh, the old funeral.  Well, when someone old dies, and you come back to the house, Uncle Tony pops some good  wine.  Nice.  Sit there with some pasta.  Nice.  And shit.  That's nice.  So I, I've never had a complaint about that, but, uh, just sitting in the church while the 
[00:26:00]  priest is going over that, and, you know, the guest of honor is rolled up in front for,  uh, everybody to see the box, and you're just kind of like, oh, this sucks.  And that's when they bring out that smoky thing.  Oh, the smoky thing's for wigs, I guess.  Yeah, yeah.  You're right.  I have seen the smoky thing.  They wave the smoke over the casket, like, it's like, well, that guy ain't gonna go to  heaven if you don't wave that smoke over the casket.  What if they missed the, the, missed the guy?  I don't know.  What if the priest was a little hungover that day and didn't do the smoke, uh, part properly?  Not enough smoke. 
[00:26:30]  And then he hits the casket with the water, right?  He goes at the casket with the water, I think.  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah.  But the water doesn't hit the guy.  It hits some, some-  Piece of wood.  Some asshole's fucking casket that you bought from a basement somewhere.  A shiny, buffed up piece of wood?  Yeah.  I'm not buying that organized crap either.  Then I had to take a wafer this weekend, and then I'm sitting there, I guess I'm supposed  to pray about shit.  Really?  Then you start thinking about stuff you don't even care about.  Yeah.  Because you feel like you have to.  Oh, yeah, when they make you pray, and you're just like, you know, of course I'll do a quick 
[00:27:00]  one for my, my son, my wife and stuff.  Then after that, I'm like, ah, that's about it, but now I gotta make up shit.  Because I'm not, I'm not kneeling long enough like everybody else.  Everyone else has these prayers for the world and stuff, I guess, and I just wind up sitting  there going like, because I don't even know how to talk to Jesus or God or anything, so  I'm just kind of like, it's silent, you know, you're thinking in your head, you don't actually  say it out loud, but you're just kind of like, oh, I'm God, hi, I could, you know.  Hi, it's me again.  Health for, you know, my loved ones. 
[00:27:30]  Hi, it's me.  I wonder what she's praying for.  Pray for her skinnier ass.  Oh, I'm sorry, God.  I should be praying, but I'm making fun of people.  God.  Then you gotta shake everyone's hand.  I don't like that thing either.  Well, they should, like, hand out some of the Perel.  That should be at the end of every pew, I think.  I think.  So on your way out, you can Perel up.  They can figure God will, like, cleanse you for that in church.  Look, like I said, I had allergies all weekend, so where do you think half the snot went? 
[00:28:00]  On your hands.  And I probably shook seven strangers' hands, so I don't know.  Hey, I had to shake your hand.  God said so.  Sorry about that.  And what are you supposed to say?  Like, God be with you or something?  Peace be with you or something?  Oh, peace be with you.  And you're like, yeah, how about fucking bacteria be with you, motherfucker?  I should have shook your hand.  Then it's that old gag.  If that guy is cutting you off in the parking lot, getting out of the church, there's no more  peace be with you.  Peace be with you.  Yeah.  Hey, motherfucker, get out of my way.  Move, asshole!  Right, right. 
[00:28:30]  It all goes out the window.  It all goes out the stained glass window once you leave, doesn't it?  For the people keeping track at home?  Yeah.  Claritin D.  Does that work?  Is working today.  Fuck yeah, I got two fucking clear nostrils.  Let's see what this fucking thing can do today.  That's great.  Like we were saying, why is it when one nostril's clogged, it'll ruin your whole day?  I don't know.  It's like, it just ruins.  You can breathe, but it's only one nostril.  Totally clear.  Yeah, my left was shut, closed when we came in here today. 
[00:29:00]  So I don't know.  The communion thing was weird to me.  Pushing them forward.  I felt like I was pushing them forward.  Like I was pushing them into the cult.  I don't want to be the guy pushing anyone into a cult.  That's how they do it.  Get the trusted, the most trusted.  A name that's a little unique, but not that crazy.  What, the middle name or?  A regular name.  Oh, the regular name?  And so the priest leans over.  He's half deaf.  And he doesn't even seem that old. 
[00:29:30]  And he's like, what's her name?  And we say it.  We had to tell the guy six times before he got it right.  I'm like, is that messing it up with the Jesus and the God?  Yeah, because now Jesus is like, I don't know.  He's looking in the book.  The guy is welcoming her to the religion.  He doesn't even know her fucking, he can't even hear well enough to get her name right.  You know why?  They're humans.  They're human beings.  So why are we trusting them to be the connection between us and the God guy?  I don't know.  I never understood that. 
[00:30:00]  Like, I know the Pope is infallible, right?  The Pope is supposed to be infallible.  Like, he can't make a mistake.  No matter what he does, it ain't a mistake.  But when he was, because to me there was only one Pope, this new guy I don't even acknowledge.  When he was like laying in bed before he fell asleep, he knew he was just a man.  Yeah.  I'm sorry, but.  But he's the Pope.  He's like holy.  Everyone else was like, oh my God, he's the Pope and he's holy.  But when that guy was like, you know, trying to get to sleep at night, he knew he was just a man.  He's just like, ah, I'm just a guy. 
[00:30:30]  And he was just hoping that, you know, it didn't crack while he was walking around.  Tossing and turning with the problems of the world.  But he knew he was just a guy.  But he knew it's just, I'm just a guy.  How am I going to fix anything?  Sorry for you religious people, but he had the same shit that we think about when we fall asleep.  Yeah.  Sorry.  But then you get the priests, which are like, they're just guys, so they can make mistakes all over the place.  They're not infallible.  Right.  So what, you got to get a good one.  Like you said, they could work a crowd.  They got a good rap, something like that. 
[00:31:00]  And if you get a guy that's, you know, like any other job, there's good people and there's fuck-ups.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Yeah, but like I said, if the priest could work the room, then I have no problem going.  This guy writes, when one nostril closes his hope, God opens another.  Ah, see?  Thank you, God.  That should give you a little faith.  Thank you.  And then the priest had a crackly microphone.  So we couldn't hear half the shit.  So what does that mean?  Like the important words that were supposed to go into the little kid's head? 
[00:31:30]  They're missing half of it?  They're missing half the words.  Was it like that one most annoying 30 seconds where our show cuts out?  It was exactly like that.  I think that might be the winner.  We got to pick.  That is a good one.  We got to pick a winner today.  Yeah, we were supposed to do that Friday, but wow.  But it was an all right weekend.  It was a holiday.  We were taking Friday off just for the hell of it.  Yeah.  It turns out I wouldn't have been able to work Friday with these allergies.  Yeah, it was that bad.  Friday was so fucking bad.  Oh. 
[00:32:00]  So bad.  And you don't get them, huh?  No, I don't usually get the allergies.  I'll get them for like a second or two.  When I first go outside, I'll be like, oh, God damn.  A couple sneezes and that's it?  Yeah, a few sneezes.  The eyes will get a little runny and shit.  Do you get the itchy eyes?  Yeah, yeah.  I get the itchy eyes.  That is way worse than the stuffy nose.  Yeah.  You want to rip your eyeballs out of your head.  They're tearing.  The corners.  Yeah.  These two corners, I probably did damage to the itching.  Yeah, you're like rubbing them raw.  You rub them to the point where you open your eyes and you're blind except for white lights. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  It's like, doesn't that scare you for a few seconds?  Yeah.  When you rub your eyes a little too hard and you're like, oh, that feels good.  I got, I'm blind!  I'm blind except for white lights!  What?  Oh, it came back.  That's just the...  I get very frightened.  That's just the fucking, uh, the pollen.  Yeah, we're going to get into this Osama thing.  It's everywhere.  Oh, yeah.  I guess we could start.  I asked Dan before the show, do you feel better that this evil person was just a guy 
[00:33:00]  in the end?  Just an aging old guy?  I, I...  We all had visions of where Osama was, what he was doing.  Even when we thought he was in a cave, I thought he had one of those fucking caves.  Like, it was like a man cave.  Like a cave with some electronic equipment and, and there's people, everyone's packing  a fucking AK and, and all kinds of weapons and grenades, right?  Well, think like, uh, Batman.  Right.  Think, uh... 
[00:33:30]  Oh, a lot of technology.  Think Austin Powers.  You're in a cave, but it doesn't matter.  It's jacked up.  But it's like an evil lair.  Yeah, you got fucking hot blondes with Uzis at the, at the...  Cronies, dressed in uniform.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cronies.  That was sort of my vision in a way.  Maybe a little more, maybe downplayed a little bit, but my vision was...  Minions.  If he was in a cave or some kind of compound, it was, it was something, it was a place you  would want to live.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, cool.  And he's constantly, like, in the lead. 
[00:34:00]  He's constantly blurting orders out and someone's going, yes, sir.  And running and, and, and, and entering things into electronic equipment.  A shark tank.  Shark tank.  Taking out a minion every once in a while because they weren't doing, uh, their, their  jobs properly.  Doing all kinds of experiments.  So they had to be, uh, uh, on a floor where the shark tank, uh, uh, uh, floor is slowly  separating.  And he's like, ah!  And Osama just goes, ha, ha, ha, and pets a cat.  Right.  Instead of killing him instantly, you gotta, you gotta make him suffer for three days as 
[00:34:30]  that this thing slowly opens and then he falls into the shark tank.  Bond villain, of course.  But it turns out, man, he was living shitty.  If, if he, if he hadn't been as, as dastardly and nasty a gentleman as he was, seeing that  picture almost made me feel bad.  Almost.  How do you, it almost, like, like, if it was anybody else.  You gotta explain yourself because people will get mad at that statement.  Oh, yeah, well, fuck that.  But as a human being, you almost feel sorry for anyone that's aging.  If it was anyone but him. 
[00:35:00]  Like, if that was just somebody, some person that was in the news for a complete different  reason, like, maybe he was the guy that invented something cool many years ago.  Right.  And you saw him in that cave with the shitty little tattered blanket watching a TV that  Sam Roberts wouldn't even take from Eric Nagel.  He had a square TV.  A square little fucking portable TV.  How does the most evil, uh, guy on the planet have only a square TV?  A square TV and that dumb remote, and he could tell his hand, his arm was, was up and cocked 
[00:35:30]  in a certain way where the remote doesn't work if he has it down too low.  He's like, ah, God damn.  He knows the remote needs batteries, but it's such a pain in the ass to just even get batteries  through the remote.  He's got Time Warner.  He wants Fios really badly.  It just sucked.  And then the guy was like, anyone else, man, he sees himself on TV and he, he gets off  on that.  You gotta stop and watch.  What are they saying about me?  Right.  I was like, when we got fired, we were always stuck.  Oh, what are they saying about us?  That's Osama. 
[00:36:00]  He was there with the blanket.  And you know, the whole place probably reeked.  You know, I stopped doing that years ago because now I know if our faces ever pop on, pop up  on TV, which it does from time to time still to this day.  I just know it's something bad.  I know they're just saying some shitty thing about us.  Recapping something shitty.  I don't even, even go there anymore.  It's an anniversary of something shitty.  Someone else did something shitty and they need to compare it to our shittiness.  Right.  It's always the same fucking thing.  And we've done some good things.  Yeah.  I never, I never acknowledge that. 
[00:36:30]  It doesn't really work that way, but one time I would like to see myself on TV where  maybe I did something nice, but we know that's not possible.  No, no.  And then he had, like you said, he had the shitty blanket, the shitty TV with the shitty  reception.  Yeah.  The room looked horrible.  Yeah.  There was extension cords like on the wall.  You would think if you were one of the people in Al Qaeda, you would send them something  nice.  Yeah.  He's really made a name for your company.  For his time in exile.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You would sneak in a flat screen TV. 
[00:37:00]  You would sneak in a PlayStation.  Something.  Give him something nice to sit there, sit on.  Maybe a new blanket.  Right.  Maybe a Snuggie.  Something.  Something.  So he doesn't have to, his arms looked a little chilly out with the remote when he could have  been in a little Snuggie.  That guy loved America.  Oh.  He would have loved to have the comforts of America.  Of course.  He was so fucking torn in his head.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Well, it is the jealousy of people that have to adhere so strictly to that religion of our 
[00:37:30]  lifestyle.  And I think that really promotes the hatred and shit.  And he, I believe he was exactly like that.  Looked at Western culture and went like, wow.  You know, I got a fuckload of money.  I would love to be able to go to Vegas and just fucking sit.  Imagine Osama bin Laden, tall guy, chicks.  There were a few sort of ethnic girls that seemed to dig his look. 
[00:38:00]  Could you see him at the crap table?  Just fucking rolling them bones.  Yeah, motherfucker.  And he's just like, you know, this guy, he just spilled coffee on.  He spilled my coffee.  You fucking bitch.  That's a sign you got me.  That was funny.  And he's just like having fun in Vegas.  Yeah.  He'd have loved it.  Absolutely.  He'd have loved it.  But no, he chose the other direction.  But instead he's got a shitty blanket that you know has bedbugs on it or some kind of  critters from the Middle East. 
[00:38:30]  That's awful.  And then he had the really gray beard.  He was a just for men guy.  Yeah, he would dye his beard black.  Isn't that a Western thing?  I would think so.  It seems to be something of pride.  And pride has no room in Islamic cultures.  But yeah, it seemed to be some kind of a pride thing with him.  And he had a soft noodle, we're learning, because he had some of that...  He had herbal...  Thank you.  Herbal viagra.  Heractile dysfunction medicine, I guess. 
[00:39:00]  He couldn't get a rod for his wives.  You think we're making up some of this shit?  Oh, you think the news would be leaking out some Washington shit that they're planting?  It's like, we won't show you the pictures, but we'll tell you he can't get a rod.  He can't get a rod.  He had to dye his hair.  He's dyeing his hair.  He can't get a rod.  There are outtakes of his videos.  His horrific kill the U.S. videos.  Apparently there's some outtakes.  Outtakes. 
[00:39:30]  And that movie, I forgot the name of it.  Was it called Four Lines?  Was that the name of it?  I think it was, yeah.  It was?  And we had the director in?  Yes.  About the terror cells and stuff?  And he portrayed these guys making their tapes, and he was the one that brought it to my attention.  Like, wow, these guys don't do it in one take.  They goof up.  Even if you're really evil.  Yeah, you gotta start laughing.  You don't get it in one take.  And Osama couldn't get it in one take, so they got all the outtakes of his terror videos.  Remember in True Lies with Arnold Schwarzenegger? 
[00:40:00]  Right, right.  When they were videotaping the head terrorist guy?  Right.  And you see the battery life flashing.  He's like,  But there is this?  Yeah.  But there is this?  Yeah.  It's like, get no battery!  He's all mad.  Does that make you sleep better at night knowing he was just kind of this guy?  I don't know if it changes my opinion of if they're any more or less dangerous or not.  I think it reinforces the fact that no matter what you do, where you are, where you work, people are just people. 
[00:40:30]  Like, that guy was just the guy.  And believe me, I'm glad he got two in the fucking face.  Don't even question that with us.  Very happy.  But we did, after 10 years on the lam, and after what he did on 9-11, him and his people, you kind of built him up into this monstrous guy.  Like you, you portrayed the cave as this technologically advanced terror network thing. 
[00:41:00]  I had fun with that, but I really thought he had some shit in it.  Right, right.  Whether it was a cave or some compound.  In Pakistan.  As we thought...  Pakistan.  Pakistan.  As we thought the White House had some kind of secret missiles and the Pentagon that was supposed to come out and shoot anything down.  That might have come across its airspace, which we realized that didn't exist.  Oh, wow.  So the other side of the coin is just as creepy.  It's the same thing.  Just as creepy.  We're just a bunch of dummies doing our jobs as good or as lousy as we did when we got our first gig. 
[00:41:30]  It works.  The biggest parts of government and entertainment and everything else that you never really get to see are run just as shitty as a Wendy's or a McDonald's or your corporate office that you work at.  There are good people.  There are shitheads.  There are people that work.  There are lazy bums.  It's all the same.  You know what bothered me about the Obama thing on, what was it, 60 Minutes last night? 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  And I know you're not an Obama guy, but I'll tell you.  When they did a close-up to it, this is my world.  Yeah.  They did a close-up and it was a side shot.  And I'm like, the President of the United States had a few ear hairs.  Ear hairs?  Coming out of the ear?  Are you kidding?  And I'm like, you're the President.  Some people should tell you that.  And it wasn't a lot.  It wasn't like moss.  It was just a couple.  It was like two.  He missed them?  And it really bothered me. 
[00:42:30]  Someone should go over him like, you know, like orbit his head from like four inches away.  And just go out.  And just pluck everything out.  And be, all right.  There's a little hair right there.  Because I plucked that shit out.  I don't leave the house knowing I have maybe a hair popping out of my actual ear.  Not the outside of the ear.  This thing was coming from deep within.  This is the first President that is at a relatable age for me and people, you know, in my age range.  40-something?  I think he's 50, I think.  He's not even 50. 
[00:43:00]  Is he 50 yet?  I think in August.  When's his birthday?  Wow.  When the hell's his goddamn birthday?  That's pretty young, right?  I gotta get him something.  How young was Clinton when he was in there?  Clinton was 40-something, right?  George W. was in his early 50s when he started, wasn't he?  Yeah, yeah.  January?  No.  Or in August.  August, yeah.  August of what?  He'll be 50 on August 4th.  August 4th, okay.  Of this month?  I mean, of this year?  Excuse me, Jesus.  Yeah, this year. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, so first President, that's, you know, around that same age range.  Wow.  So, like, when you see him going through shit, you're like, oh, wow, you know, he's gotta  clip them ear hairs.  Yeah, he's-  He's gotta watch them brows.  He's at that age where shit you never had to worry about all of a sudden starts happening.  Yeah.  All of a sudden the eyebrow hair starts fucking sprouting.  He's like, ah, Michelle, I got up, I sneezed, now I can't move my neck.  Yeah.  It sucks, I got a speech.  I can't move my neck because I sneezed.  What the fuck is going on? 
[00:44:00]  But, uh, where were we?  Yeah, the Bin Laden thing.  Yeah, yeah, he was giving a speech.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Everyone wants to see the death pictures?  Yeah.  Government should release a picture to show the world that he had a tiny little fucking  schmeckle.  A tiny dick?  You think the death pictures should be a penis?  Well, that would make everyone happy, at least.  At least have that.  And in essence, they did say that.  That he had a small schmeckle?  Well, that he needed a little assistance.  Well, he had a soft noodle.  Yeah.  It could have been a big noodle that was just soft. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, but once it's soft, does it matter if it's big or not?  Are they known for having big, uh, big, uh, schmeckles?  I don't know.  In that part of the world?  If the, um, well, he's Saudi.  Does the Saudis have the big schmeckles?  You never really hear about Saudis with big cocks.  Oh, they got a lot of, uh, a lot of skin that might make it, uh, deceiving, right?  I think there is a lot of, like, foreskin going on over there.  There's a lot of foreskin going on in the, uh, in the Saudis community. 
[00:45:00]  Pops out like a groundhog.  Oh, yeah.  It's crazy.  That thing's got to travel through a fucking tunnel before it comes out.  Ha, ha, ha, the old flesh tunnel.  Uh, what else from the weekend?  When we get back, we're going to get, we're going to take a serious tone because Rosie  O'Donnell.  Oh, God.  We, thank God we didn't become friends with her.  We almost became friends with her.  Oh.  But I can't be friends with people.  Like, I, I could be friends with, like, Anthony and people that, like, you know, politically  are different than me. 
[00:45:30]  That's fine.  But when you get, when you get to the point of saying the shit that Rosie O'Donnell says.  Delusional.  It's delusional.  And Michael Moore says.  Yeah, Michael Moore also.  See, I could, if I cared about politics, I could debate you a little more, but I don't.  That's my problem.  Delusional crap.  But this is, this is the shit, like, how do you, how, how do you even be friends with  people like this?  Yeah.  And what's going through their fucking heads that they say shit like this?  All it reminds me is, it will forever remind me, that people just forget how, how angry 
[00:46:00]  they were.  Not all people.  And.  Because I bet you they would have thought this way right around 9-11.  Yeah.  That's the problem.  Probably those two.  You almost want to, you almost want to give them a pass and say, well, it's been 10 years  so maybe they forgot.  These two people right here, I am convinced, had the same thought if we caught Osama bin  Laden less than a year after 9-11 happened.  Yeah.  I would bet the farm on that one.  Yeah, you're probably right.  But I don't have a farm, so.  Oh. 
[00:46:30]  That's an easy bet for me.  What'd you lose it on?  Did you bet it on some other prior thing that was obvious?  I'd have bet the farm on that.  Fuck, I lost.  Oh, that's right.  I lost the farm on that last bet.  Shit.  And I also want to acknowledge that Bob Costas, once again, is the biggest douche in sports.  Makes it about him all the time.  You watched the Kentucky Derby, right?  Yes, I did.  20 to 1 fucking long shot wins the damn thing.  Wow.  Yeah.  What was the name of the horse again?  Animal Kingdom.  Animal Kingdom. 
[00:47:00]  But more importantly, Bob Costas with his over-the-top, melodramatic opening.  Every sports event he's hosting, he needs that dramatic music, a lot of clips, and his amazing  voiceover to inspire people.  And I thought for a while that it was sports in general, and then it finally hit me, because  Bob Costas has had a bunch of big ones in the last year.  Yeah.  It's only Bob Costas.  Yeah.  If another channel has a sporting event, they'd never go this crazy with the melodramatic, 
[00:47:30]  with the shadows, and the early morning with the tiny little horses, and will they become  the next Kentucky Derby winner?  They're not acknowledging that the life of a Kentucky Derby horse is shitty.  Do you think they used to do that on World of Sports, when they would talk up the people?  I don't know.  Maybe a little bit.  But not, I know sports does it in general, but not to the significance that Bob Costas does it. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I think Bob Costas wants to be known as this guy.  NFL Films does it.  Like, when they're talking about a game, and it's that film look.  Yeah, but it's like, and then the Miami Dolphins took the field, and it shows slow motion,  them running out, Dan Marino running.  There it is.  And the frozen tundra.  Yes.  The frozen tundra of Green Bay.  On a frozen field, these two combatants went head to head. 
[00:48:30]  These gladiators.  Yes.  Slow motion.  There's the ball spiraling through the air.  Holy shit, it's a perfect throw.  The spear.  Yeah, shit like that.  Yeah.  Gets a little pumped up.  That really, I don't think as a guy, you could pass by that channel when that's happening.  Never, man.  Like, you're like, I don't even know what the fuck this is, but NFL Films is badass.  We all got what we can deal with.  I like that.  I have no problem with that.  Yeah, yeah, that shit's cool.  This Bob Costas shit, though. 
[00:49:00]  I got the open.  You want to go through it real fast before the first break?  Bob Costas, Kentucky Derby broadcast intro.  By the way, what was it?  Two and a half, three hours of pre-show for a two-minute race.  A lot of hats, Opie.  A lot of coverage of the hats, which were huge.  Jimmy Norton tweeted a couple of pictures of his costumes and hats that he had to wear  because he's doing something for Leno.  One of his pictures went viral.  Yeah.  Reddit picked it up.  Yeah.  He got a lot of views on one of his pictures.  It is ridiculous. 
[00:49:30]  Did you see the one where he's dressed like an old lady?  Of course.  It was ridiculous.  Good for him, though.  I did a quick compound show.  Around the Derby?  For the Derby.  It was quick.  It was like 45 minutes.  All I did was a little pre-show and then covered the race and then I was done.  Right.  But we had to have the big hats on.  Oh, good.  So I was wearing ridiculous hats.  I want to see Anne's hat.  It was fun.  I had a big hat.  Did you have the proper hat?  What about the hat?  It doesn't matter as long as it's ridiculous. 
[00:50:00]  So did you make your own hat?  No, I used one from my Halloween costume.  Remember?  The D'Artagnan hat?  That's all.  Did you put a few flowers on it?  And Melissa had a big hat, too, with a big butterfly on it.  Oh, perfect.  All we did was go to CVS, grab a floppy hat, and then some shit in the toy section, and  just threw it on her hat.  That's all you need to do.  And it looked ridiculously silly.  Oh, there it is.  The modern-day gladiators.  Thank you, Jay.  Yes.  Modern-day gladiators.  Modern-day gladiators.  In the frozen tundra of Green Bay. 
[00:50:30]  Here's Bob Costas.  Bob Costas.  And it's all the top open.  We'll have to stop this.  It's Derby Day in Louisville.  Already epic.  The music, epic.  Epic for a two-minute horse race.  Yeah.  And if one of these fucking horses breaks an ankle, guess what happens?  They shoot it in front of everybody.  Whoa.  And then what'd you say?  Power winch the cable around the neck and pull him into the fucking trailer.  Oh, there I am. 
[00:51:00]  That's my hat.  Whoa.  That I was wearing.  All right.  Which, you know, that's a good hat.  That's your Derby hat.  That's my Derby hat.  The Derby meets the Pirates of the Caribbean.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then there's, oh, look at that.  See, she's got the proper hat.  Right.  There's a big yellow butterfly on it.  It's a pink floppy hat.  There you go.  But it was very important to pop on.  That's more Derby-like.  And see the hats.  But are guys wearing hats at the Derby?  Yeah, I think some guys wear some wacky hats.  But every time I turned my head, I'd whip her in the face with my big plumage. 
[00:51:30]  With my big feathers.  So it was a little annoying.  Stupid hats.  I wonder how many fistfights at the Derby because of that happened.  Oh, because of the hat?  I can't say my horse, you fucking bitch.  The horse goes from the left to the right and then you're hitting the person to your right  with your plumage.  Remove your hat, miss, or I'll get a black gentleman in an elevator to do it for me.  Bob Costas.  Hill, Kentucky, the biggest event in horse racing surrounded by one of the biggest parties  of the year.  It's all been ongoing in and around Churchill Downs since the gates opened at 8 a.m. 
[00:52:00]  And some 150,000 have poured onto the ground since then.  Hat wear, haberdashery, some of the dubious, and high hopes for wagers placed across the  board.  This is not really the one I was hoping for.  It's bad.  I'm talking about the one where they show the fouls.  Are they called foals?  The little foals.  Like early morning.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Trotting out to the racetrack and you see the dew.  Yeah.  And they make it dramatic that every spring they got these little shitty horses and maybe 
[00:52:30]  someday they'll be a Kentucky Derby winner.  Maybe one day.  Right.  In this uncommonly wide open field, Dialed In was the morning line favorite.  Fuck Dialed In.  Any horse Calvin Burrell is riding should be the most feared man on the field.  Burrell.  Can't he do all this shit without the epic music?  The epic music behind him?  Probably not.  And it would just be announcing.  He'll be atop twice the appeal, shooting for an unprecedented third straight Derby victory  and his fourth in five years. 
[00:53:00]  Off the track, mint juleps, of course, are the signature refreshment enjoyed by many in  attendants, the masses in the infield, and the familiar faces making their arrivals as well.  It's all leading up to the 11th race of the day.  19 three-year-olds traveling a mile and a quarter, framed by the twin spires.  The most exciting two minutes in sports, the 137th, Kentucky Derby.  This wasn't the one I was thinking of.  That's fine, though.  I mean, it still pushes our point forward.  Very, very dramatic. 
[00:53:30]  A lot of pomp and circumstance.  That's the other one he did with the hope for all the little horsies.  The little horses.  Well, he's got to fill two and a half hours with his own crap before the two-minute race.  What the fuck?  Before the minute and some odd race is over.  And I was at my brother's, and I was saying to the people there, I was thinking, how many  people missed the race because they were on a beer line or something?  Yeah.  Well, that's what happens.  You've got to make sure you get there.  I mean, if you go to a sporting event and you're on line and a goal is scored or a home 
[00:54:00]  run or something, you're like, fuck!  You get mad, but at least you've got more game.  The rest of the game.  These people, I guarantee there was a lot of people that didn't even see the fucking  race because they were waiting for beers or something or had to go take a leak.  I missed it.  Missed the whole damn thing.  Yeah.  I wagered, too.  I went to an off-track betting location.  First, I went to Hempstead.  I went to go to Hempstead, which...  Those are not your people, sir.  Wow.  Let me tell you, I have not been through the heart of Hempstead in quite some time. 
[00:54:30]  And it...  I felt like I was watching The Wire in 3D.  Right.  It was amazing the amount of people that I would want nothing to do with in that area.  But then I pull up to...  I see a building and I see a giant satellite dish on the roof.  So I know, all right, OTB.  You're in the right place.  They had turned it into a rainbow shop store.  It's gone.  Really?  It's gone.  So I had to turn around and I went the other way into East Meadow. 
[00:55:00]  And there's an OTB wagering location in a bar.  Wow.  Like, they've relegated it now where there's just these machines on the wall.  And you push the buttons and shit and it spits out the fucking tickets.  Is it OTB?  Yeah.  I thought OTB closed down.  It's in Nassau County.  They have Nassau Downs, OTB, off-track betting.  And Suffolk County still has it.  But New York City doesn't have it.  Oh.  Yeah.  So New York City got rid of it.  I thought it was a New York State thing. 
[00:55:30]  No, no.  Just the city.  I was wondering how the hell they worked it where it's like, yeah, we want to put this  inside a place that serves liquor.  A bar.  All right.  We got it.  We'll do it.  Yeah.  Yeah, but go after violent video games because that's scary, right?  That's what you got to do.  There's Osama with his dyed beard.  Look at him.  This is the outtakes.  They refused to release the audio, by the way.  Yeah.  Again, it's just a fucking piss off.  Fucking release the audio of him fucking up.  I think that would be great to see that he was just a man in the end. 
[00:56:00]  That hat is weird.  Looks like a layer for a cake.  It's got to go if we get two more and frost them.  Get that from the cake boss.  Yeah, the cake boss.  Stupid cake boss.  I was reading the paper today.  He's opening up a place in Times Square.  Really?  Yeah.  Like the Pop-Tart plays?  How long is that going to last?  He's going to do well.  You think?  That dumb cake boss does well.  Yeah.  Cake boss.  I hate those shows.  All right.  When we get back, Michael Moore and Rosie O'Donnell. 
[00:56:30]  Mike?  Oh.  On Osama bin Laden.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  These two, like I said, are delusional.  Holy shit.  And Michael Moore's tweets yesterday from Mother's Day.  We get it.  You had a mom.  She's dead.  And you were reflecting on everything.  Did you need, I swear, it had to be a hundred tweets about what reminded him of mom.  Really?  It's like, yeah, yeah, whatever.  Go.  And she used to tell me every night, you know, goodnight. 
[00:57:00]  Don't let the bedbugs bite.  All right.  Really?  Really?  She should have told you, put that down.  You're going to get fat.  Your stupid enabling mom is dead.  Yes.  Who cares?  Who led you down the path of fat.  Is that when he started eating?  Mama did.  Is that when he started eating?  Mama did.  Let's stand him.  First day of Radhaman.  Well, that's his outtakes on Family Guy, yeah?  Yeah.  And SNL did a podium bit.  I don't know what the bit is. 
[00:57:30]  It was a listener, so I don't trust them a hundred percent.  I got a few tweets myself.  But I got a few things like SNL did a bit about podiums.  And I'm like, all right, now we did this podium, whole podium thing that came out of nowhere.  Last week, maybe?  Yeah.  Or, I don't know, the weeks are flying by.  It was just some local politician at a gas station with a podium, and we thought it's  odd that he had to say, bring the podium to the gas station because I want to be behind  a podium.  And we did a fine 20-minute rant on it.  We're talking about the ridiculousness of the podium and when it's appropriate to have 
[00:58:00]  one and maybe not.  And I told Anne it was just a local politician.  It wasn't like Obama was setting up on a tarmac or something with a podium.  So I don't really understand why all of a sudden they needed to do their podium bit.  And I don't know what the bit is, so we might see it.  Are we doing a who-who here?  Well, it's based on listener recon, which is usually one percent if that.  Yeah, that's pretty shitty, right?  So I don't know what it is, I'd like to see what it was, but some kind of podium thing. 
[00:58:30]  But if that's the case, then there is officially too many bits that are in parody with what  we've done, and I am accusing them of thievery!  Of who-whoing us?  Or at least, you know, an homage.  We're going to go to break.  I did the God thing earlier.  Yeah.  This thing is going viral.  What is it?  Should I just play it?  It doesn't need a setup.  It's from a little kid on a public access show.  Uh-oh.  And he's a big fan of the Jesus. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, right, right.  He's a big fan of the Jesus.  Yes, he certainly is.  And let's not forget, Larry King coming in today.  Are we going to be nice to Larry?  I've promised that the first fucking thing I'm going to ask him is about-  The groceries?  The groceries.  Yeah, we got to.  I got to hit him with that immediately.  Immediately.  How was he thinking?  And where I'm at with Larry King, I thought for many, many years, he was the best interviewer 
[00:59:30]  on TV by far.  Yeah.  Because he kept it simple.  He knew how to listen.  Yeah.  But, you know, the last few years, it was a little rough, as you know, if you listen  to the show, because we couldn't wait for Larry to mess up.  Oh, everything.  We put a clip out there, and it was always something horrid.  So I'm kind of torn today.  I mean, we got to kind of do our thing, I guess.  Well, I'm not going to beat him up or anything.  No, no.  He's just some old guy that did a show for many years, but I got to fucking-  And now he's doing stand-up? 
[01:00:00]  That's why he's coming in?  Yeah.  He's doing some kind of stand-up thing.  I guess he's going to be at Westbury.  Let's ask him to do a few jokes for us.  Yeah.  All right.  I do shut you.  Oh, yeah.  But first, God's doing a new thing.  Boys and girls, the Lord Jesus Christ is the one who gives us new life, and he's doing  a new thing for us.  You can always do it. 
[01:00:30]  God is doing a new thing.  You can always do it.  God is doing a new thing.  You know he's doing it.  Who's doing it?  God is doing a new thing.  You know he's doing it.  Yo, who's doing it?  God is doing a new thing.  My God is doing a brand new thing.  But since time began, he remains the same.  Faithful, I ran into his word and silent.  I'm going to store and I start.  I look down through the edges and you will find God doesn't change, but he knows the time. 
[01:01:00]  From harp, piano, to song, to rap, you know.  God's with his soul and cannot lack his soul.  God is doing a new thing in our lives.  So, we're doing a new thing through Jesus Christ.  We're doing a new thing through our music.  We're doing a new thing so he can use it.  God's using this music out of the coming strong.  Michael Clancy's y'all singing his song to make it think about the way that you live. 
[01:01:30]  And that you know Christ is the one who will give.  Peace in your heart, a new start.  Call on the Lord and he'll do his part.  A brand new thing to your raggedy walk.  He might just match it up to that big old talk.  God is doing a new thing in our lives.  So, we're doing a new thing through Jesus Christ.  God is doing a new thing through our music.  We're doing a new thing so he can use it. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, oh, oh yeah, oh, oh yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, hit me.  You know he's doing it, who's doing it?  God is doing a new thing.  You know he's doing it, yo, who's doing it?  God is doing a new thing.  You know he's doing it?  God is doing a new thing.  You know he's doing it, do, do, do, do, do, do, God is doing a new thing.  Like an MC, I'm here to both 
[01:02:30]  I rap about Christ, y'all, he is a dope  So loud and prouder than God I serve  Try to say, keep winning, huh, you got nerve  Chris is the reason for Michael Clancy's  He's a focus of a daily walk, y'all  Without whom he ain't nothing but name  But through God, we're doing brand new things  God is doing a new thing in our lives  So, we're doing a new thing through Jesus Christ  God is doing a new thing through our music  We're doing a new thing so he can use it 
[01:03:00]  The virus, call the Opie and Anthony Show now  866-WOW-1-WOW  That's 866-969-1969  Send your feedback to feedback at opieandanthony.com  The Opie and Anthony Show  Oh, I like it  Good choice, Travis 
[01:03:30]  So you want to start with Michael Moore or Rosie O'Donnell?  Either or  Same fucking fat slob to me  Yeah  I think we'll start with Rosie  Rosie  And then we'll go with Michael Moore  I just can't believe there's people that think this way  Yeah 
[01:04:00]  I really, I'm just amazed by this  And they aren't the only ones  I've read a lot of stuff, a lot of comments from people  About this whole Osama bin Laden situation  With him being killed  As opposed to captured, things like that  And so a lot of people have this opinion also  Not more than, you know, don't  Right  But I think too many  But on both sides, the left and the right in general are in agreement, right?  Yeah, for the most part  But you'll still get like these people  I mean, then you go way left  You get  Way left, you get this shit 
[01:04:30]  You get this shit, is what I'm saying  Thank you  Why is it, if people question  Whether or not  Filming Americans in the streets  Chanting USA  And a lot of the coverage of the White House protesters  Seem to be drunken fraternity boys  Right  Why this  I'll stop right there  First of all, it seems like Obama  And the White House in general  Would have wished that  We didn't have a video of everyone celebrating 
[01:05:00]  That's just a natural reaction  Yeah, that's the media  And it was a natural reaction to people  They were like, oh, he's dead  You know what?  Let's get out and celebrate  And I think I said it last week  When the Cairo thing happened  The Egyptian thing happened  People were celebrating for a long fucking time  I really thought that, you know  All day Monday would have been the same stuff  But people went home and went to bed  And got up for their jobs  That celebration didn't last that long 
[01:05:30]  No  A couple hours maybe, right?  Yeah  Yeah, we got shit to do here  Three or four hours  I was really surprised by that  I really thought we were going to  Push this one forward  And really have a big time celebration  That lasted most of Monday  Maybe even to Tuesday  It was pretty spontaneous  You know, it just  He was dead  People decided  Let's hit the streets  A little celebration  Wave the flag around a little bit  And she doesn't understand that  And drunken frat party  I mean, yeah  There were a lot of young people 
[01:06:00]  Out there  But the same could be said  For the people that were supporting  Obama  When he was campaigning for president  Right  You could say  Oh, that looks like  A drunken frat party  Right  Bunch of young people  Waving flags  Wanting change  Saying that  So what's her point?  I was hoping the celebration  Would last longer  Quite frankly  Yeah  Boys, right?  Why this is in some way  Determined to make you un-American  If you don't support that 
[01:06:30]  Right?  You can be happy  For the death  Of a person  In terms of  That he no longer  Walks the earth  That he  Quote unquote  Didn't deserve to live  You can also be upset  About the fact  That he didn't have  Due process  That he didn't  Get tried  There's  When you're talking about  As they call it  Enemy combatant  They're not  They don't get due process  Right  This guy  Did not deserve 
[01:07:00]  To get due process  Legally  Was not entitled  To the due process  Of the  Constitution  Of the United States  Of America  He was targeted  For elimination  Whether by  A predator drone bomb  Or a piloted aircraft  Or a sniper  Or a Navy SEAL  That's a few feet away from him  Think Hitler  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Would you want Hitler on trial?  They tried to kill him  A few times  He just squeaked through 
[01:07:30]  You know  This guy's the modern day Hitler  He would have continued  Yeah  I mean his numbers  Are nowhere near Hitler  Yeah  The all time leader  But I mean  If he asked Osama bin Laden  He would have wished  To put up Hitler numbers  Of course  And if he was still alive  He was probably hoping  Still that he was going  To put up Hitler numbers  I think he was hoping  For one more biggie  Right  One more biggie  To put his name  Slap his name on  And be like  Yeah, see  I'm still relevant  I'm still doing it  And if you're an American  You think it's all about me 
[01:08:00]  Meaning this country  But the fact is  Osama bin Laden  Killed a lot of people  Around the fucking world  Yeah  Let's not forget  He was responsible  For a lot of shit  Not just on 9-11  And this idiot  Can't understand  That you don't  You don't take a guy  Like that  And capture him  And put him on  Some kind of circus trial  So first of all  A team of lawyers  Can use some type of  Phony bullshit  Wrangling  To tie it up for years 
[01:08:30]  Cost a lot of money  And even  And believe me  I understand  She was saying  It should be done  Outside of the US  The UN should have tried him  Which is even worse  Because God knows  They've bungled  So many of these  Bullshit war crimes trials  I don't trust the UN  I wouldn't trust them  Of course not  No  And then  You'd have  A lot of these fanatics  Taking hostages  Right  And saying  Release Osama bin Laden 
[01:09:00]  Or we're going to  Blow this plane up  Or we're going to  Kill these people  Or we're going to behead  This person  And that person  It's not going to  Stop here  Right  And that is what  Was eliminated  When you eliminated  Bin Laden  And as far as  America goes  We put just about  Everyone on trial  There's only a  There's only a short list  Of people we would  Never put on trial  And that would be  Saddam Hussein  Osama bin Laden  Qaddafi  We're not putting  That fucker on trial  No  And who else  They want to  Who else would make 
[01:09:30]  That short list  Of people that we  Would actually  Execute  That's about it  Anyone else  We would drag in  For a stupid trial  Yeah  It's a dumb trial  Said about  The fact that  He didn't have  Due process  That he didn't  Get tried  That he wasn't  You know  Brought to the Hague  For war crime tribunal  You can have  As an American  You have the right  To say  I wish that he  Wasn't killed  Right  Now many many people  Including now  On the Twitter feed  Say well Rosie  You know  Often in capital letters 
[01:10:00]  It was illegal  For them to fly  Planes into the  Twin Towers  I'm fully aware  Of that  I think  I think Osama  Got off easy  To be honest with you  Yep  Quick two bullets  To the head  Headshot  One headshot  And one to the gut  I think  Right  Just close your eyes  Osama  Just close your eyes  Won't even hurt  Yeah  You got the  Prop Joe treatment  Yeah  Come on  How my hair look  Or the snoop treatment  You didn't get there yet  I'm not there yet  Sorry I'll shut up then  He got off easy 
[01:10:30]  If you think about it  Yeah  Right  Yep  I'm fully aware of that  Because other people  Are capable of criminal acts  On our soil  Doesn't equate to  Therefore we are allowed  To do criminal acts  On their soil  Not criminal acts  America has always been  The beacon of light  The beacon of light  Yeah let me tell you  About two beacons of light  On Japan  That we did  Because that was necessary  It's called atomic bombs  You fat piece of shit  We as Americans  Aren't all these 
[01:11:00]  Good  Goody two shoes  Let's look at everything  From this beacon of light  Attitude  Sometimes  People do horrid things  To us  And the only response  Is to do horrid things  Back  And this idiot  Thinks we should have  Tried him  That he's due  He was due  Due process  Why not just take him  To one of these  Judge Judy's  Hey let's just put him  On the Judge Judy show  And they could duke it out  No 
[01:11:30]  And we did use  That beacon of light  If you think about it  Yeah  This was easy  Right  Instead of having  The trial like you said  With the beheadings  And stuff  And people being held hostage  Until they release Osama  Or getting the scumbag  Lawyers involved  That want to make a name  For themselves  And make their careers  This saved lives  Around the world  In many different ways  One of which is  He's gone  So I'm sure  They'll get another guy  In there  But it's not him  Orchestrating these things  Anymore  With such 
[01:12:00]  A cult of personality  That he had  Plus if you  If you drag him  To the United States  Or wherever  For a trial  You know he would be  Living better  Than how he was living  Of course  Because now that  We've seen the video  He was living pretty shitty  And every American  And Westerner  Really would be  Up for grabs  For Al Qaeda  To grab up  And say  Release him  Or we'll kill  These people  So this dummy  Doesn't understand  It's not about  Due process  And he wasn't  Fucking 
[01:12:30]  Due that  Right  He wasn't  Owed  Due process  Of the laws  Under this  Nation  And he wouldn't  Have a square TV  In jail  He would have  A nice  Nice letterbox action  Of course  What 9 by 16  Oh and he'd be a hero  9 by 16 ratio  All the Muslims  In prison  This guy would be  Walking around  Pimping yo  Oh yeah he would  Live in Lodge  You know America  Has always been  The beacon of light  And hope for the world  Right  We're supposed to be  The leader  In terms of our  Our morality 
[01:13:00]  And our democracy  And our fairness  Right  So saying the reason  That it's alright  For us to do that  Is because  Well look what  They did to us  Well that does not  Equate  Because you don't  Want to become  What you loathe  Right  Wasn't the whole point  Of this is that  We are not monsters  Right  It's a war  Oh brother  It's a war  Situation  Dumb fuck  It's like  Alright  Japan  Bombed the fuck  Out of Pearl Harbor  Should we have just  Sent out people  To get 
[01:13:30]  All of the commanders  Of the Japanese army  And put them on trial  Or should we have  Taken a bunch of bombers  And blown the fuck  Out of fucking Japan  And taken over  All of the Japanese islands  And flamethrowered  The motherfuckers  Out of caves  It's the same situation  It's a war situation  Not a criminal situation  It is an organization  That declared  War 
[01:14:00]  On the United States  And attacked  The United States  And were not then  Do the legal protection  Under this country  Right  And we're not  As a country  Sorry Rosie  We're really not  That glorious  When it comes right down  To it  Yeah yeah  Have your fucking  Delusions  You can romanticize  It all you want  But the fact is  Yeah we do  Some horrific things  Ourselves  Maybe from your  Gated community  And always have 
[01:14:30]  By the way  With your armed  Fucking guards  And your gated community  Everything looks  Hunky dory  But you know what  Bottom line is  Where people  Just as vicious  As everybody else  And we just  Have a lot more  Distractions here  Yeah maybe not  As vicious  As a lot of  Countries out there  But certainly  We do our own shit  We can be  But  So then you go  We move on  To Michael Moore  Yeah  This fucking guy  Another load  Another fucking  Person who's  Has to eat 
[01:15:00]  To cover something up  I'm embarrassed  I ever took a picture  With this guy  Oh I know  At this point  Fucking delete mine  You did  Nice  Here's Michael  Moore on  Piers Morgan  Michael let me  Start with a  Simple question  Were you  Pleased when you  Heard that  Bin Laden  Had been killed  What do you  Think his answer  Is  Let me finish  Chewing  That's his answer  I'm pleased  That he'll  No longer  Be around  To do any 
[01:15:30]  Harm to anybody  The world's  A better place  Without him  But to be  To celebrate  Someone's death  I think that  We barely  Celebrated his  Death  People gotta  Fucking relax  It's not a  Holiday  I actually  Walked home  On Monday  Cause I wanted  To get the feel  Of the city  I was kind of  Curious  Yeah  People  There was no  Celebrating going on  It was a regular  Fucking day  In New York  I mean  You had the flare  Up in Times Square  And Ground Zero  And other places  Around the country  Sunday night 
[01:16:00]  For a while  But by the time  The sun  Came up  On Monday  It was  Business as  Fucking usual  The celebrations  Were not  Happening anymore  Look  Also  There was a  Quick flare up  People  What people  Don't seem  To understand  This wasn't  A scheduled  Celebration  Hey  Bin Laden's  Dead  Remember  Tomorrow  We're all  Gonna get together  In such and such  A place  And time  And celebrate  This was a  Natural  Organically  Occurring  Feeling  That we had  Or that 
[01:16:30]  Certain people  Had  As a country  And as individuals  To go out  And feel  Good and proud  And safer  Whatever the feeling  Was  It happened  Spontaneously  So there's no way  You can really  You know that's the  Difference too  You make a really  Good point  Rosie and Michael  More would maybe  Have a point  If all of a sudden  There was a whole thing  Okay  Oh yeah  The Osama Bin Laden  Celebration's gonna happen  In Times Square  Wednesday  Almost like a  Ticket tape parade  When the Yankees 
[01:17:00]  Win a World Series  Exactly  Then that would be  A little uncomfortable  For a lot of people  How do you fall  Yeah how do you fall  To feeling that people  Have that they needed  To get out  And say wow  Holy fuck  Just about 10 years later  This guy's finally gone  Let's celebrate a little  That was a sigh of relief  More than anything  Yes  And like you said  It was organic  So there's nothing wrong  With anything that pops up  Organically like that  Nothing  If all of a sudden  Shirts were being made  And banners 
[01:17:30]  And scheduling  Where everyone should be  Right right  That would be  That's hold a rally  That we're very happy  And proud  A day of celebration  That this man is dead  No  I think I would be  Uncomfortable with that  As well  Yeah yeah  It would be weird  It would be like  Ew really  Really  Did you think  I hate asking you  Obama stuff  I'll be completely  No I'll be open minded  Did you think he did  Alright at ground zero  Yeah from what I saw  Yeah it really was  A hard thing to fuck up  He wasn't showboating 
[01:18:00]  Which was good  I was hoping he wasn't  Going to do that  He didn't talk down there  In the public  No  For the media anyway  No I was able  To get out of town  Before he fucked up  Traffic too badly  So I don't have that  Against him  I filmed the motorcade again  We were in a special spot  People are such idiots  I'm sorry  But they really are  My video shows  No one on the street  Because we were in a building  That was pretty much  Closed off  They can't tell everyone  To leave the building  So if you left  Our building  You were right in front 
[01:18:30]  Of barricades  With no one else  It looked like  A ghost town  Yeah  People are like  Oh obviously  No one gives a fuck  That Osama's in New York  But if you went  One block  Or Obama  Did I say Osama  Jesus Christ  Everyone's been doing that  Obama  But if you go a block  Where he makes the turn  Into the Times Square  There were thousands  Upon thousands of people  Really  But people saw my little snippet  And think  Yeah see no one gives a fuck  About him coming to New York  It's like  Seriously  No they gave a shit  And Voss got stuck  Did he?  In his garage 
[01:19:00]  That was my whole goal  On Thursday  And it worked perfectly  But then we filmed  This fucking guy  That had dead legs  Dead legs  And Voss was beyond  Hilarious about it  Really?  I didn't see that one  Well I popped on  My flip  Because we're waiting  For Obama to come by  With the motorcade  And Voss starts bitching  How he can't leave  Because his car  Is in the garage  And as he's  There's a guy  With dead legs  Crutching right behind him  So of course  I'm like  Fuck Voss  And I start shooting  This guy  And then Voss  Had great commentary 
[01:19:30]  Yeah  Great commentary  He's good like that  It might be  In all the usual places  If not  I'll retweet it today  I was getting so steamed  When I was leaving  On Thursday  Because they did  They had it barricaded off  They were going to change  The direction  Right  Of  I guess that was  48th  Yeah  If you're the president  You get to go down one way  Yeah you go down one way  It usually goes west to east  It's a one way street  They turned it around  But they turned it east to west  And I'm going west to east  To try to get to third 
[01:20:00]  So I get to the tunnel  And these idiots  In front of me  Are doing  What they usually do  Two miles an hour  Just stopping at the yellows  And stuff  And I'm thinking  Do these morons  Not know  That  The cops aren't going to be like  Well okay  You're on the road  Continue  The second they shut this down  They are throwing you  The fuck off of this road  Of course  And now you're in traffic  That's trying to squeeze  Down one more road  Right  So I just wanted to get  The fuck off of that road 
[01:20:30]  Right  And people just drive  Like idiots  They don't know  What's going on  Do they know  That they're going to  Reverse the direction  Of this traffic  No of course not  And you're off the road  But you got out easy  Did you see the motorcade  Coming from the airport  No I was  You must have just missed it  I was  I would have  If I was closer  I would have seen  Air Force One  Or something  That's how far out  I was already  I was on the expressway  Before I even landed  You know what's more impressive  Than seeing Obama's limo  Presidential limo 
[01:21:00]  There's two of them  By the way  So even if you're  Oh yeah  Even if you're one of those guys  And you figured it all out  Now you gotta still pick  Which one  Which is which  Yeah  So right there  Is a 50-50 shot  But you have to get  To that point  To get your 50-50 shot  More impressive though  If you ever see  The motorcade go by  The lead SUVs  This time around  They had the windows down  The guys scared the shit out of you  That were looking out  Of these things  A lot of shit going on  I felt like I was  In a video game man 
[01:21:30]  I mean they had like  Full armor on  They had a look like  Don't even fucking joke  Because I don't give a fuck  Oh yeah  And they had weaponry  That I'm sure you would know  They're ready to rock  Those guys  Dude  They look like  Fucking rock stars man  Yeah they could  Way more impressive  Than seeing the limos  If somebody tried  To pull shenanigans  They would be  Out of there  And all over that  Motherfucker  In a second  And they had the windows down  And they were just  Checking out everything  Oh my god  You gotta chill  Like wow  Wow the firepower 
[01:22:00]  That these fuckers have  Anyway  Yeah  Oh and then  Did you see  Did you see  The two black guys  That I filmed  Yeah yeah  The one was  Had a chain  And he wanted  To beat the shit  Out of the other guy  And he was just saying  Osama bin Laden  Yeah what's important  To that video  It was two blocks  From the firehouse  That Obama was at  Really  Literally two blocks  Where they had  All that crazy security  I finally left  I was like  Alright I gotta get  The hell out of this circus  Two blocks away  What was the guy's problem  I don't know 
[01:22:30]  I came on the scene  Too late  He just kept saying  Osama bin Laden  Over and over again  And he was like  Hassling the other guy  And the one black guy  Was like  You know  You're lucky this time  Is the stupidest thing  To say to the guy  With the chain  He goes  Really  Beat me down now  Beat me down now  He made the one guy  Look like a punk  Because the one guy  Should have started  The fight at that point  And he didn't  He was like  Fuck that  This guy called me out  And I gotta now  Walk away embarrassed  And ashamed  But back to Michael Moore 
[01:23:00]  Michael Moore  Mike  I'll back up  Because we just kind of  Yeah let's listen to this  To be  To celebrate  Someone's death  I think that goes  A step further  Than my own  It's not the way  I was raised  I was raised  In an Irish Catholic  Home  I believe in those  Principles that I was  Raised with  I hear a lot of people  In this country  Often say  What would Jesus do  I would love to know 
[01:23:30]  What he really believes in  Because I  I know  All of what you hear  Is bullshit  I think he's one of those  Bullshit guys  That really gets on TV  And he knows what to say  To keep everyone's interest  I would love to know  What he actually believes  Because I don't believe  This crap  I hear a lot of people  In this country  Often say  What would Jesus do  I don't think  Jesus would go down  To ground zero  Like a lot of people  Did on Sunday night  With a champagne bottle  And pop corks  And have a party  Know why Jesus  Wouldn't have done that 
[01:24:00]  Because he could turn  Water into wine  Right  You asshole  If you could do miracles  Why the hell  Would you go celebrate  Why wouldn't he  Miracle his ass down there  What a fucking idiot  Oh  Yeah some people did that  And I had no problem  With that  Yeah whatever  And it didn't go for days  And it wasn't organized  But Michael Moore  Has got a problem  He wasn't raised that way  But I guess he was raised  In a way where he  Shoved the camera  In an elderly  Alzheimer's patient's face  And asked him questions  About guns 
[01:24:30]  In Bowling for Columbine  Yeah he probably  Even though he doesn't agree  With Mr. Heston's  You know  Stance on guns  That's certainly not  The Jesus thing to do  Right  No  How about that move  Good point  How about things he's done  In most of his films  Oh please  He continues  They killed him  But what I'm saying  Is they didn't kill him  Because there was  Some kind of firefighter  Or something going on  They went there  With the intention  To kill him  That's an execution  Yeah  Or an assassination 
[01:25:00]  Whatever you want to call it  And I think  I think  Look  Like I said  I'm glad he's gone  But I  I just feel  Something has  We've lost something  Of our soul  Here in this country  And maybe I'm just  An old school American  Who believes in our  Sorry but I don't think  We ever had it  That's the point  Yeah  I don't really think  We had it  Like you think we did  There's been  Sanction 
[01:25:30]  American sanctioned  Assassinations  If you want to call it that  Forever  Since the inception  Of this country  It's  It's  It's normally  You know  Kind of out in the open  But sometimes  It's covert  We've  We've killed people  And had them  Replaced with other people  Over the years  That's kind of a  Dastardly thing to do  But then there are  Other things  I mean I'm sure  We wanted  Hitler  Killed  Before  He died 
[01:26:00]  You know  At the hands of  Himself  But you know  The Russians were  Closing in on him  But I'm sure  We would have liked  To have earlier  Gotten a team in there  To assassinate him  Oh yeah we would have  To kill him  No doubt  What's the difference  No doubt  What's the difference  You're talking about  Osama Bin Laden  Right  Fat fuck  Yeah  Send him in  And if they did go in there  With the full intent  On just killing him  So be it  So be it  I have no problem with that  I don't feel  Dirty as an American 
[01:26:30]  That our country would  Do something like that  I think it's great  I think it shows strength  It shows some balls  And it shows that maybe  The political correctness  Hasn't overtaken the country  And that we  We still can be  A strong country  That leads  I don't think  Obama had a thought  Of bringing him in alive  No I don't think so  Which is kind of refreshing  I think all of his advisors  Probably sat there  And said  No  No this isn't good  For our country  To have this guy alive  And in prison 
[01:27:00]  Right  Awaiting some kind of  A sham  Fucking long ass trial  You see the other video  Of Biden calling people  To say  No we got him  Oh really  You haven't seen that yet  Biden's an idiot  He kind of sounds like an idiot  Yeah we got him  It's like breaking news  Like if you're getting  Engaged or something  You gotta call all your people  Yeah  We got him  He's making phone calls  They got a little video of that  Oh god I haven't seen that one  That they released  You haven't seen that yet  No  Oh it's kind of douche chilly  We got him 
[01:27:30]  We killed him  Wait till you say it  It's for you  Biden's always a foot and mouth  He's the worst  Douche  Who believes in our  American judicial system  Something that separates us  From other parts  Other countries  Where we say  Everybody has their day in court  No matter how  Bad of a person  Now for the most part  That's exactly what we do  But once again  It's Osama bin Laden  Yeah  And by the way  The modern day Hitler asshole  While they're waiting  For their day in court  And they're being interrogated 
[01:28:00]  It's people like Michael Moore  That also come forward  And say  Well these people  Aren't being treated nice enough  So what the fuck do you want  Do you want him to just sit  In a regular federal penitentiary  Being treated like a king  Like you said  Living better than he was living  In that shithole  Yeah he would be  In Pakistan  Certainly would be  Or do you just want him  Gone  Eliminated  Shot in the head  By soldiers  That were at war  With Al Qaeda  And killed 
[01:28:30]  Who was the leader  Of Al Qaeda  We've said  Over the years  We were at war  We were sending  Planes  Dropping bombs  Cruise missiles  Predator drones  Killing massive amounts  Of Al Qaeda  And that was okay  Right  Oh you know what  It wasn't take  There weren't take  Prisoner bombs being dropped  Where they would open up  The front like a cartoon  And a little accordion arm 
[01:29:00]  Would come out  And grab them  Sweep them up  And sweep them into the bomb  And then the bomb  Would take off  To the nose cone  Yeah  It was always the nose cone  Yeah the nose cone  Would open up  And pop them in  No they were killing people  Can I off road again  For a second  Because me and my brother  This is driving me  And my brother's nuts  You know those stupid  Is it the Geico commercials  For insurance  The radio ones  The guy  No you know  The weird commercials  Oh the  Geico  Oh no it's not Geico  Which one is it 
[01:29:30]  With the voice guy  The black guy  No  Oh  Is the pen mightier  Than the sword  That's Geico  Yeah  Alright  Foghorn  Leghorn  Oh I saw that last night  Why are we talking  About this  What the fuck  Who's doing that voice  That's not Foghorn Leghorn  For the older people  That listen to us  It's driving me  And my brother's nuts  I'm like it's not even  Close to Foghorn Leghorn  I thought they were  Doing something on purpose  To make it not sound like him  No that's gotta be  The new voice 
[01:30:00]  Of Foghorn Leghorn  And it's not even close  And that's one of those voices  That guys that do voices  Could kind of do  Yeah  And they picked that guy  The guy is horrible  Horrible  And I was yelling  That to my wife  I guess she doesn't know  Who Foghorn Leghorn is  Because I'm like  Anyone that's older  And remembers Foghorn Leghorn  From the fucking  Cartoons  It's not even close  That voice  Yep  It was  Could you get that  Danny really fast  It's so bad  You picked up on that  I saw it last night  I saw it last night  For the first time 
[01:30:30]  I was actually thinking  About it  Because you know  How to do voices  And I'm thinking  Wow  This has gotta fucking  Piss off Anthony  Yeah  It really  It's awful  Mel Blanc  Was so good  With those voices  Sure  And it's very hard  To imitate  But this is just  You'd get any guy  Off the street  And he should be able  To do this  Switching to Geico  Really save you  15% or more  On car insurance  Would Foghorn Leghorn  Make a really bad  Book narrator  It was the best of times 
[01:31:00]  It was the worst  I say worst of times  And by worst  I'm talking as bad  I say as bad  As my Aunt Jenny's  Cone pudding  That stuff will sink you  Like a stone  Okay that was a little  You getting all this  In there son  I just added that last part  It's called ad living  Anyway  I say it was  Geico  15 minutes  Could save you  15  He doesn't even do  The I'll say right  No  I don't know  What they were thinking  How did they cast him  Is there an  Original Foghorn Leghorn  Clip online somewhere maybe  Oh gotta be  Foghorn Leghorn 
[01:31:30]  I don't know  It's just a dumb thing  That drives me nuts  Hey speaking of Michael Moore  We got Jim on the line  Here's the Foghorn  Hold on  Jim hold on one second  You're a cat son  Cats don't eat worms  You're taking the food  Right out of my mouth  I don't go around  Chasing mice  Stand up boy  You're tripping over  Your own feet  Now you stay away  From worms  And I'll stay away  From mice  No dream boat  Tug boat that is  This boy's making  More noise  Than a couple of skeletons  Throwing a fit  On a tin roof  Pay attention to me boy 
[01:32:00]  I'm not just talking  To hear my head roar  Smart boy  Got a mind like a steel trap  Full of mice  I say she reminds me  Of Paul Revere's ride  A little light  In a belfry  The new version  Is too slow  Yeah  I'm not just  Talking to hear my head roar  Yeah  That's fucking great  But he had comedic timing  Yeah  When he did Foghorn  Leghorn  The new one is just horrible 
[01:32:30]  And the voice is higher  Like this voice  The real Foghorn  It's quicker too  Higher quicker  Yeah  You know they made him  Sound kind of slow  Retarded  And retarded or something  Jim what's going on buddy  Jim  Jim  On the line  You got a great point  About Michael Moore  No  It says if Michael Moore  What  You mean Ian  Ian  Ian what's up  What's up Ian  Sorry about that  Hey if Michael Moore  Was a true American  He would have rounded up  All the Muslims 
[01:33:00]  Like the Americans did  With the Japanese attack  Pearl Harbor  Yeah how about that  How about  We've lost who we were  Michael Moore saying  This guy brings up  A great point  We rounded up the Japanese  And put them in internment camps  So there wouldn't be  No spying  And other shenanigans  Going on  With Japanese  And these were  You know  Americans  Right  These were Americans  These Japanese  And they were put in  Internment camps  We also used to drop  A-bombs  Yeah  We're not going to be  Dropping an A-bomb  Anytime soon 
[01:33:30]  You're the only country  That's ever used  The atomic bomb  In war  Against another country  And  Is that the old  Old school America  That you're missing  That you're waxing fantastic  About there Michael Moore  The old school America  Where we hosed blacks  Hosed down black people  And set German shepherds  After them  Is that the America  You missed there Michael Moore  Is that the one you're missing  You stupid fuck  Which one  Or the one that just goes out  And kills someone  That killed  Thousands of Americans  Declared war 
[01:34:00]  On this country  We reciprocated  And killed him  What's so bad  About that  But no  There's  Michael Moore's got a problem  He wants to go back  To the good old days  Right  Where um  You know  Where we just go around  And fucking beat the shit  Out of queers  And nothing will happen to you  Right  You'll be pat on the back  Right  For that  Yeah where we used to put  Padlocks on the queer bar  And burn it down  Yeah and burn it down  How about that one  You stupid fuck  Oh my god 
[01:34:30]  Where women couldn't vote  Until what  Ten years ago I think  Yeah yeah  Couldn't vote  Yeah no right  Keep them in the house  Where the husband  Could come home  And knock her around  A little bit  And she'll just  Tell her friend  She fell down the stairs  Oh fucking asshole  Those good old days  We were never those  We were never that country  No  I love when people think we were  We were never all about  The picket fence  And the nice house  There was always some shit  Going on behind that fucking door  And there was always some shit  Going on at the White House 
[01:35:00]  And the Capitol  And the Pentagon  For years  So  I don't know what he's thinking  Right  This delusion people have  Of what this country  Was and is now  And what it's supposed to be  Ward Cleaver had herpes  Yes  Ward was a drunk  Ward was a drunk  A raging alcoholic  And he had herpes sores  On the head of his penis  Oh  Oh god  That's what America  Really was  You should have seen  What June had to contend with  When she went to go down  On Ward 
[01:35:30]  She had to smell  His secretary's pussy  Oh yeah  You know he was just  Banging his secretary  He's all drunk at the office  Banging his secretary  Stupid Michael Moore  Why are we so smart  Oh  I don't know  We should be a lot further along  Than we are  No kidding  Still doing this radio shit  Oh please  Both should have empires  I tell you  Oh my god  Instead they fucking go  To this asshole on TV  Yeah he's the go-to guy  Where we say  Everybody has their day in court 
[01:36:00]  No matter how  Bad of a person  No matter what  Piece of scum they are  No  They have a right  To a trial  No  And this man  Was a mass murderer  He was  Responsible for the deaths  At least in this country  Of nearly 3,000 people  And you know  After World War II  We just didn't go in  And put a bullet  To the head  Of all the top Nazis  We put them on trial  We took them to Nuremberg  And we put them on trial 
[01:36:30]  And we said  No this is  And that's what we're doing  With the other  Al-Qaeda assholes  Unfortunately  But we  You know  We would not have  Put Hitler on trial  No I don't think  The Russians would have either  We would have  If we had the chance  We would have  Went in there  And killed Hitler  I think the Russians  Would have  Eliminated him also  And that's the  First on the scene  And that's the America  You're talking about  That's exactly what we're doing  Because all the  All the other  Al-Qaeda guys  For the most part  Yeah  Are going to be  Put on trial  And here's another thing  During the Nuremberg 
[01:37:00]  I guess not all of them  I should adjust that  Because we have  Taken out a few others  During the Nuremberg trials  There wasn't a bunch of Nazis  Still running around  That were going to  Take hostages  Until some of these people  That were on trial  Were let go  You know  It wasn't a situation  Like this  Where Germany  And Nazi Germany  Was still operating  And we were putting  People on trial  So that the Nazi Germany 
[01:37:30]  Can say  Well we're going to  Start taking prisoners  And executing them  Unless you let these people go  They were done  Ski  Right  Done  Surrendered  Gone  This war is still  Going on  You dummy  You dummy  That was after  The war  Then the trials start  Then the fucking  Trials start  This is still  We're still in  A battle  With these people  So  Therein lies 
[01:38:00]  That difference  Fatso  A lot of people  Are mad at what he's saying  But I think he's just  Saying that to  You know  To get a little attention  I don't  I don't know what  I don't  I don't think he knows  What he believes  At this point  Yeah I don't either  I really don't  Believes in food  Yeah  Know that  That fucker's just  A fat bastard  But he also knows  What to say  To get everyone  All riled up  Oh he loves it  So does that mean  He believes it  I don't know  I really don't know  Do you follow him on Twitter  Do I follow him on Twitter 
[01:38:30]  I do  Oh you'd know if you do  He tweets like a maniac  I think I might have put him  Under my news thing  You know I was very excited  I found out who follows me  On Twitter  Who  Adam Baldwin  Adam Baldwin  Adam Baldwin from Full Metal Jacket  That's a big  Animal Mother  That's a fucking biggie  Fuck yeah  Fuck yeah  That's a biggie  That is a good one man  There should be a way  To find out which celebrities  Follow you  That would be kind of  A cool little app  Yeah  I was like  What the fuck man  Somebody said 
[01:39:00]  Hey you should follow  Adam Baldwin  He's got some of the  Same thoughts as you  I'm like oh okay  He does fall a little more  Onto the religious  Christian side of things  But his right leanings  Are pretty funny  Pretty good  So I checked it out  And I'm like alright  Let me follow  And I looked  And it says  Follows you  Like what the fuck  Man right  You feel kind of good  When a celebrity  Follows you  Especially somebody  Like Animal Mother  From Full Metal Jacket 
[01:39:30]  That's crazy  Yeah thank god  For the sickle cell  Oh wait  He's not one of  The Baldwin brothers  No no  He's that guy  I just saw a google image  I'm so off  He was an independence  Day  I know exactly  You're talking about  There he is  Look at him  That's pretty cool  Crazy  Very cool  Here's the rest  Of the Michael Moore clip  On trial  We took them to Nuremberg  And we put them on trial  And we said  No this is important  For the world 
[01:40:00]  To see  These criminals  And it's important  For history  To have a record  Of what they did  And so we're going  To do this  In a courtroom  A courtroom  Boy  Yeah where all good  Happens  Right Michael Moore  I'm so happy  You still believe  In the court system  Yeah  But guess what  I don't  Fuck the court system  Anything that can be done  To avoid  I don't have confidence  In the court system  Anything that can be done  To avoid taking something  To a trial  Right  Is great in my book  And I have a book 
[01:40:30]  Mmhmm  I don't like the idea  Of things going to trial  Especially something  Of this gravity  Because it will just be  A circus  A circus  There would be lawyers  That would be  Wow  This poor guy  You know  He grew up  They'd bring up  His upbringing  And religious beliefs  And it would turn out  To take years  And God knows 
[01:41:00]  What kind of jury  They get  At a UN trial  At the Hague  Right  God knows  What kind of  A corrupt  Shit system  That is  Also  Instead  What we did here  Is  I don't know  You ever kick  Like an anthill  Yeah  They're all just  Willy nilly  They don't know  What the fuck's  Going on  Because  Bin Laden's gone  They don't know  What  They can't really  Rally to  To try to  You know  Get him released  Yeah  There's  There's  No place  To go to  Worship the guy  No 
[01:41:30]  So they're all  Just like  What do we do  What do we do  What do we do  What do we do  What do we do  Yeah  They're thinking  Of ripping down  His compound too  So it doesn't  Make it a  Kind of a  Holy land  People are starting  To go there  Pakistan  Will not allow  That though  Pakistan  I've said  Pakistan  My whole life  But I guess  Pakistan  According to Obama  Pakistan  And those  Motherfuckers  It's  We are paying  Bribery money  Three billion  I think  Three billion  A year  Yeah  England pays  All the 
[01:42:00]  Free nations  Pay this  Fucking  Shit hole  Pakistan  Bribery money  We pay  They extort us  They say  Look  We have a  Government in place  Where we're not  Going to go crazy  And do these  Crazy  Muslim things  We also have  Atomic weapons  We are an atomic  Power in this world  Give us money  And we'll  Keep things  Cool  Oh believe me  We're going to 
[01:42:30]  Fuck you over  On things like  Osama bin Laden  We're not going to  Tell you where he is  If you get information  Where he is  And inform us  We will tip him off  We'll harbor him  In an area  Where no one  Like him  Should have been  Able to hide  It turns out to be  The perfect area  For him to hide  Like it's perfect  Well they  The areas where  A lot of military  Guys go to retire  There's sort of  A West Point thing  Right there  But they knew  Of course Pakistan  Anyone that's telling me 
[01:43:00]  That Pakistan  Did not know  And to the highest level  Right  In Pakistan  Didn't know  And weren't protecting  This guy  You're fucking a liar  Or delusional  They absolutely know  And I think  I think  Even Obama  And Hillary  I think they all know  Also  But you got to  Play your politics  Because again  These are  This is a nuclear power  We don't want them  Running amok  And deciding  You know  You're not paying us money 
[01:43:30]  Well now we're going to  Treat you  And Israel  And your allies  Like we would have  If you weren't  Paying us money  All these years  Right  Yeah  I think Osama  During the 60 Minutes  Interview last night  Yeah  Basically admitted  Oh he did  Yeah  He's like they had to know  Yeah  I forgot his exact quote  But he's like  How could they not know  He was like somebody  Was protecting him  Right right  And by somebody  I mean the entire country  And administration  Over there  In Pakistan  You think Steve Croft  Should get rid of  Some of the moles  On his face 
[01:44:00]  Yeah yeah  He's a big interviewer  Moly moly moly moly  You could go to  One of those skin doctors  They'll fucking  Shave that shit  Right down for you  Have that taken off  I don't understand  The people that walk around  With moles these days  Yeah  That's an easy  You could easily  Take care of that  He's got a few  Weird ones too  I hear Babu  Was bringing him food  Babu  Babu  Oh Babu  Babu  Someone also said  That Osama bin Laden  You're a bad man  A very bad man

[01:45:00]  All the time  Yeah he did  That dog  Never quite sure  How much leash he had  Right  Never quite sure  Always thought  He could get to  Whatever fog he put  Out for him  But that leash  Always just about  A foot too short  Just short  Just too short  Yeah  Nothing more funny  Than that dog  Running full speed  Towards Foghorn Leghorn  And then going  And then just  His neck would stretch out  And then running  Out of chain  It's fantastic  Abso-fucking-loatly  Yeah

[01:55:30]  She's alright though right  Yeah she's alright  For a  51 I would have  Never guessed that  No no no  Never  I was  I would  Yeah  I was about 10 years  Off easy  I was thinking  Late 30s  Yeah  Sir Paul  Sir Paul  Alright let's see  Yeah look at that  She's alright dude  I mean there's  Nothing wrong with that  She's uh  I mean you could  Try to knock her down  If you want  I mean she doesn't  Have the elephant  Fucking knees  No  Doesn't have the bad  Fucking old lady elbows  That's a  That's a giveaway 
[01:56:00]  No  And she doesn't have  Any like saggy skin  In the back  Do you think the  Marriage license  Like she  Actually literally  Takes a quarter  And just rubs off  Uh  The  The marriage license  And when it says  Paul McCartney  On top  She just knows  She won  Oh yeah  That's right  That is an instant  Winner  And no prenup  No prenup  For Paul McCartney  No prenup  Again  This motherfucker  Just has too much cash  Well that's  Cause a lot of people 
[01:56:30]  Yeah  That's what it comes down to  Give it away  Give it away now  Like  The definition of money  To him is  He has no  That's crazy  Like he has enough money  That when you talk  Prenup and all that crap  It doesn't matter  Yeah  He can't spend all the money  He has  Yeah  I guess out of principle  You should fucking do  A little prenup or something  That's like me with  Dimes and nickels  Right  I throw them away  You just throw them down  When I get change  In the store  And it's dimes and nickels  Like quarters I keep  For like parking meters  So I put them in my ashtray 
[01:57:00]  In my vehicle  But dimes  Nickels  And pennies  Like I just take them  And when I leave the store  I go whoosh  And I toss them  And they go  Clangity clangity clang  Let the kids find them  And the kids will find them  And shit like that  Because I don't want to  Put them in my pocket  Because if I put my  iPhone in that pocket  Then it's getting all  Fucking scratched up  So I just throw that  Change away  I swear to you  It happened yesterday  At CVS  Yeah  I lost all my change  And I looked down  There was a couple  Dimes and nickel  A few pennies  And I saw that quarter 
[01:57:30]  And I did reach  For the quarter  Because every time  I need a fucking quarter  For a meter  I never have it  You need quarters  For like things  Like parking meters  And what not  And threw it in my console  And then you put it  In your car  You know  I never carry them  In my pocket  Oh hell no  Because it scratches up  Your phone  And for Paul McCartney  That is like  Hundred dollar bills  More than  Like fucking  Like tens of thousands  I think  He looks at  Like that  Where he could take  A stack of ten thousand dollars  And just toss it  Walk out of a store  And just throw it 
[01:58:00]  In the garbage pail  And to him  That's like nickels and dimes  I would love to know  Why he needs  He feels like he needs  To get married  At 69  For the third time too  Right  At least three  Yeah this is  Well he was  Married to Linda  He didn't have one  Before Linda right  Yeah I think he did  I think he had like a  Did he have a wife  Before Linda  No just a girlfriend  Yeah  Some fucking  Beatles groupies  All the pre-Beatles  Chicks  Had to be thrown away  Big hairy muffs 
[01:58:30]  On those chicks  But they all had to be  Thrown  They all had to be  Thrown out  They had to be  Thrown out  There were girls  Crying when he got  Married  Like they had a shot  They had a shant  Yeah you got married  To Linda  And then old peg leg  And then  Heather Mills  And this one  Yeah  Oh  You know what  We're just  We're just male  Chauvinist assholes  Are we  I think we are  Alright  Because we don't even  Acknowledge that this woman  Could have had her own money  We're douchebags 
[01:59:00]  Wait a minute  We're doing this whole  Paul McCartney thing  And I'm thinking to myself  Of course she  I'm thinking she had to be  A fucking waitress  Out of like a TGIF  You're talking about  How she won the lottery  And Doug  If this is true  It's hilarious  Go ahead Doug  Hey  I heard on the news  That she's  A business woman  And she's worth  Over 200 million dollars  Whoops  So at that point  Who really cares  But see  We can't even think that way 
[01:59:30]  On this show  We're just assuming  That she's just  Some lucky bro  Some dumb fucking  Yeah  Right  Just oh I'm gonna be  Paul McCartney's wife  And that's what I do  That's it man  I'm out  What is  Wait  What is this  I gotta go to Lancaster  I know  Lancaster  What's going on  Hey guys  Hey  I just want to  Thank Anthony  For being the reincarnation  Of Fez's daddy  Because every time  Fez finds money

[02:01:00]  Paul McCartney  Was engaged  Before Linda  But he broke it off  Or it was broken off  Somehow  That seems to be  The facts  That are coming  In  Okay  She was  Transvestite  That's what I heard  Oh really  Or transsexual  Transsexual  Oh no  She broke it off  Wow  After  Suspecting  Paul  Fucking around  He probably was  Right  What a stupid bra  That is  Yeah right  Who cares  Fucking  Fucking  You keep that

[02:08:30]  Because we've  He's been around forever  We've goofed on him so much  That it's a little odd now  That he's going to be in here  Right  It's one of those things  You know  We've kind of  Over the years  We've given him some guff  The Motley Crue  You know  The groceries  How many  The groceries  How many phone calls  Have we taken  From Larry King  Over the years  My god  Thousands  Millions  So I guess  We're supposed to  Trash him today 
[02:09:00]  Uh  Well that ain't gonna happen  You know  If you've listened  To this show  Over the years  You know that  Ain't gonna happen  What are we gonna do  Hey there's a  Ascidic newspaper  Hascidic  Hascidic  Newspaper in Brooklyn  I seed him  You know the famous  Situation room photo  That we're all checking out  Yes  This newspaper in Brooklyn  They edited out the two women  Yeah  Yeah  Why  I think it's something to do  With the religion  And seeing women  In this um 
[02:09:30]  Awkward position  So they have a newspaper  Where they just don't show women  Or they don't show women  Uh  In um  Powerful  Some kind of  Roles  Either in powerful roles  Or looking  I'm searching for the story  Or looking like they're  In any kind of distress  Really  Yeah they fucking hate women  By the way  They do  But you know the answer to that  Yeah I'm pretty sure that's it  That's pretty much it  Pretty sure that's it  The article that I read  Yes sir  Says that  Travis  Travis  Yes  Says that  This newspaper  Never intentionally prints 
[02:10:00]  Any images of women at all  In case they could be considered  Sexually suggestive  Oh okay  Hillary Clinton is  Wow  Sexually suggestive  Wow  Get the fuck out of here  They actually photoshopped her  Out  Look at that  That is weird  That's hilarious  She's never there  How is that the news  Which woman  Wait could you go to the original  Do you have it handy  Yeah  Because I forgot about the other woman  In the back  Oh  Sticking her head around the corner  Yeah look at that  They just chopped her  How did they 
[02:10:30]  What did they add an arm in  On that guy  Look how badly it's done too  Wow that's so fucking weird  Is MS paint on that  It's horrid  And  They had to add half a body  On the guy that's sitting there  And because she's sexually suggestive  Women don't exist  Wow  This guy wants to know  If we have truck parking  At my brother's restaurant  Yeah  Is it like a truck stop  You don't know  He was mad  Because you don't offer showers  Nah 
[02:11:00]  You know what  You can have your opinion  I don't care  But don't follow it up  With a sorry  Because you're not sorry  Just drill that hole  In one of the stalls  In the men's room  Would you finally do that  Just drill that fucking hole  And then he would have been happy  Yeah  That's what the truckers  I'm not mad  That he didn't have  A good experience  I'm mad that he's being  Dishonest about it  Nah  He's not sorry  Nah  Nah  Because he certainly  Could have done that  Like off air  If he's a big fan of the show  But he wanted to make it hurt  And then followed up  With the  I'm sorry  That's what's bullshit  About the whole thing  That is so weird 
[02:11:30]  The Hasidic Jews  They just erased  The right out of it  They just took her  Right the fuck out  God damn  We have any Hasidics  That are willing to talk today  Because when I go to B&H  I see the fans  They're there  Oh do I love the B&H  Danny's fixing it now  With MS Paint  Oh thanks Danny  And just whiting her out  Perfect Danny  You never know she was there  Perfect  Look what you could do  I gotta draw them back in  You could get a job  With the Hasidic newspaper  But I know the Hasidics 
[02:12:00]  There's a few that like our show  So I would love to know  What that's about  If they're willing to talk today  I love that B&H  I get recognized there  By the  Oh I know  With the  Guys are great  With the weird like  Payus thing  Curly fries  The curly fries  On the side of their face  Curly fries  I just think  The yarmulkers  Doesn't that make it hard to date  I would think  Unless you're dating  That's the only thing I think  But they want to date  Inside their faith anyway  So for the girls  They don't mind that  But if a girl is being honest  Is that kind of  A turn on to them 
[02:12:30]  Well she's dressed like  A holly hobby doll anyway  Did you ever see them  Walking around Brooklyn  It's like what the fuck  This girl's dressed like  Laura Ingalls  Come from your job  Of churning butter somewhere  Yeah yeah yeah  And they go out with the guy  With the curly hat  And the fucking  Good point  Floppy hat  Good point  And that's a great job  Danny fucking  Danny ought to save that  And post it  That's a good job  For Microsoft  You did great  I'd never know she was there  I gotta fix it back  Right  So that's 
[02:13:00]  That's really strange  Yeah that is  Out there in Brooklyn  But I wouldn't put anything  Past them  Hasidic  Hasidic  Remember the listener tip  SNL steals our podium routine  Yes  You want to hear it  It's 25 seconds  Alright  Now again  We weren't sure  Because we didn't see it ourselves  But it came to our attention  That SNL might have done  Our podium bit  Which we did  Very well about a week or so ago  It was very spontaneous  We just  There was a local politician  At a gas station  Had a podium  And we just started talking about  How ridiculous the podium is 
[02:13:30]  And how politicians  And public figures  Drag them around  And there has to be a guy  That has to roadie the podium  And set it up in front of the gas pump  If gas prices are high  Or in front of a grocery store  If they're gouging the prices of bread  It looks out of place  I mean when you're at a high school  And you're talking  On stage  Right  And you got a podium  You don't think twice  But all of a sudden  At a gas station  Right in front of the pumps  They had to pull out a podium  So we did a whole thing  And we were thinking  How silly it would look 
[02:14:00]  If a politician was  Going to be at a few places  So he had to put a podium  On one of those  Segways  Segways  On a Segway  He just puts a podium on front  And he can stop  Give a speech  And then  Just kind of ride away  To another place  And then it led  To us talking about lecterns  And the difference  Yes  And it was just  It was just a spontaneous conversation  About dumb podiums  And then a listener said  SNL  Did a bit about podiums  Out of nowhere  And I'm thinking 
[02:14:30]  One listener  Or two listeners  That I saw  That tweeted this  And our listener record  Is so bad  Not good  With them doing recon  For this show  Not good  They're terrible  Well  Excuse me  How this is typed up  I think  I think  I think we're going to be  Embarrassed again  They're idiots  Right  The listeners  I don't know  Let's say  Finally he was uninvited  But fought his way  Through security  And refuses to leave  Former New York  Gubernatorial candidate  And current member  Of the podiums  Are too damn expensive  Party  Jimmy McMillan  Allow me to reintroduce myself 
[02:15:00]  My name is Jimmy McMillan  And I believe  With the help of  America's voters  I can be this nation's  Last black president  I guess there was a visual  On top of that  So the podiums  Are too damn expensive  Yeah  So he's not able  To use a podium  That had nothing to do  With what we were  Talking about  No  In any way  Shape or form  No  So once again  We're sorry Tessa 
[02:15:30]  Now  I guess it's just  Hoping  Hope on our part  That the show's  Funny enough  For you to  Bite off  Wow  Wow  The listeners  Have nary a clue  This David in Israel  Is going to help us out  David  My David  With why  Hillary Clinton  And the other broad  Were scratched out  Of that photo  For a  Hasidic  Newspaper  You scratched them out  Like Area 51  Good morning  How are you guys 
[02:16:00]  Hello David  God you sound Jewish  How are you  It's not that Hillary  Is sex or anything  She's as ugly as they come  I don't know if I can say  You guys are getting in trouble  No  She is  But I think  It's a general policy  That they have  It's not that women  Are evil  Or that we don't like  Women or anything  It's because  Of the nature  Of when men  And women  Get together  Because the religion  Opposes sex  Before marriage  So it's not that  And they're women  But if you're going  To show women  And you're going  To expose people 
[02:16:30]  To things that  They haven't been  Exposed to  It may get them  Worked up  And looking around  And stuff like that  So it's a general rule  It's not against  Any one particular person  Or anybody in power  Or anything like that  But you don't want  To go ahead  And show things  That people  At least that's  What they feel  That people don't  Have to see  So they  Cut everything out  Now that  But that transcends  Truth and honesty  And what  Really transpired  That ideology  Doesn't that seem  A little odd  No not to me 
[02:17:00]  When I grew up  With it  It's not  It's not that  We  Not like the Catholics  We grew up  That sex is bad  There's nothing wrong  With sex  In fact  We're taught  That sex is a good thing  And if it's done  In the proper way  But this is nothing  Sexual about Hillary Clinton  Sitting in a war room  Watching Bin Laden  Getting killed  With the  You know  Some of the  Upper echelon  Of  The White House  Yeah  100%  No one's saying  It's a sexual  Picture  Or  It's  Anything to do  With sex  But the paper  Has a general rule  Where they  Try not to put  Women in 
[02:17:30]  Because  If you're going  To go ahead  And analyze  Every single picture  Well  Where does this  Picture stand  Where does that  Picture stand  Well why not  Analyze every single  Picture  You're not putting  8 billion pictures  In the paper  I think it would  I think it would  Be good  To look at  That picture  And have  These people  Realize  Look  This has  Nothing to do  With anything  Sexually  It's not going  To turn anyone  On  It's not going  To give them  Ideas  I think  Personally  It's a cop  Out  For the fact  That  The Hasidic  Don't like  Seeing women  In any place  Of power  100% 
[02:18:00]  Not  I was a kid  I thought  The same  Thing  Because  We never  Have women  Out there  In public  And the reason  Is because  You don't  Want to  I guess  Expose people  Too much  If they're  Not going  To be looking  At it  They're not  Going to  Be thinking  About it  Are Hasidics  Just so  Horny  So horny  That the  Perv switch  Would go off  And a picture  Of Hillary  Clinton  I don't  I don't  Think so  I never  Found her  Attractive  Then what's  Then why 
[02:18:30]  She looks  More manly  Than most  Of the guys  In that room  Like I said  It's that  Blanket rule  That they're  Not going  To show  You know  That's just  An odd  Culture  For the first  Time  I have to  Say I  Want a  Female president  Really  It'll drive  These Hasidics  Nuts  And the  Arabs  You guys  Are a lot  Closer than  You think  Within a  Year  They'll think  That a ghost  Is president  Imagine  Imagine  You got a  Female president  And every  Image of the 
[02:19:00]  Female president  Has to be  Scratched out  The newspaper  That's hysterical  Yeah that would  Be good  Wow a ghost  Is running  This country  What happened  When  Hey what  Happened  When  Golda Meir  Was the  Prime Minister  Of Israel  What did  They do  Then  Good question  I believe  That people  Were not  Around at  The time  Well what  Would they  Have done  Yeah  I don't  Know  I don't  Run the  Paper  Oh  My son  David  Hey yeah  You know  You just  Came up

[02:47:30]  Was  Never  Nervous  Again  Radio  Two  Years  Later  Got  Into  Television  Always  Did  Both  Never  Had  A  Nervous  Moment  Again  In  Brookhead  Because  I  Learned  That  Morning  Yeah  Wow  It  Ain't  Brain  Surgery  Sure  Okay  So  What  Is  Going  To  Happen  Is  Going  To  Happen  But  If  You're  Honest  In  Retrospect  I  Realize  If  You're  Honest  With  The  Audience  You  Cannot  Go  Wrong  Have  You  I  Miss  Cued  Records  That  Morning  Or  Broke  At  The  Wrong 
[02:48:00]  Time  Or  Said  The  Wrong  Thing  The  Audience  Has  Got  To  Be  Saying  It's  His  First  Day  Have  You  Ever  Thought  You've  Been  Too  Honest  With  The  Audience  At  Times  Because  I  Know  When  We  Do  This  Show  Especially  If  It's  A  Slow  News  Day  You'll  Know  That  You'll  Notice  Certain  Things  Will  Come  Out  Of  Us  That  We  Might  Not  Bring  Up  On  An  Ordinary  News  Filled  Day  No  Because  You  Got  Well  I  Used  To  Do  A  Morning  Show  That's  Where  I  Really  Started  To  Get  Famous  Was  Doing  A  Funny  Morning  Show  And  I  Did  All  Sorts  Of  Wacky  Things  But  No  I  Never  I  Was  Raised 
[02:48:30]  In  A  Different  Era  Of  Broadcasting  I  Don't  Necessarily  Mean  Outrage  Stuff  I  Mean  Just  Really  Letting  People  In  On  Your  Personal  Life  Growing  Up  Things  Like  That  No  No  Because  When I  Started  Interviewing  People  It  Was  Never  About  Me  It  Was  Always  About  Them  I  Never  Used  The  I  When  I  Interviewed  People  I  Thought  My  Opinions  Were  Irrelevant  Like  A lot  Of  Guys  Today  I  Don't  Like  Because 
[02:49:00]  Let  The  Guest  Talk  It  So  Simple  If  You  Think  About  It  But  A lot  Of  These  Guys  They  Have  To  Talk  Just  As  As  The  Guest  And  My  Friend  Herbie  Colin  Says  You  Know  Where  You're  Successful  One  You  Created  A  Vacuum  And  Filled  It  Second  You're  Dumb  That's  The  Truth  You  You're  Like  Why  Why  Did  You  Do  That  The  Simplest  Question  You  All  These  Guys  When  The 
[02:49:30]  And  My  Question  People  Came  Over  To  Me  Said  You  Know  You  Asked  The  Same  First  Question  Every  Night  Which  Was  What  Happened  Yeah  I  Would  Have  Reporters  On  Generals  People  Involved  People  Over  There  What  Happened  But  Most  Guys  Think  That  They  Have  To  Look  Smart  So  They  Start  To  Say  You  Know  Today  Well  Here  And  Here's  My  Opinion  The  Simplest  Thing  Is  If  You  Say  What  Happened  One  You  Learn  A Lot  You  Learn  It  From  Their  Point  Of  View  I  Wasn't  There 
[02:50:00]  So  I  Don't  Know  More  Medicine  Than  Doctors  I  Know  More  Lawyers  I  Understood  That  Right  And  I  Always  Knew  That  I  Would  Be  There  Tomorrow  Night  You  I  Want  To  Be  That  That's  What  The  Name  Says  I  Want  My  Guest  To  Be  Great  I  Want  To  To  Super  Great  They  Say  The  Larry  King  Show  Was  Great  Last  If  I  Did  Comedy  I  Want  The  Comedian  To  Be  Funny  Why  Would  I  Want  To  Be  Funny  I  Don't  Want  To  Top  Them  I  Got  To  Jump  In  That's  That's  Been  Our  Secret  For  Many  Years  There's  A lot  Of  Radio  Guys  That  Feel  Like  They  Have  To  Be 
[02:50:30]  The  Funniest  Guy  In  The  Room  When  You  Interesting  Where  Did  Happen  On  Opie  And  Anthony  Right  Right  So  I'm  Gone  You're  Here  Tomorrow  Right  So  If  This  Show  Is  Good  They  Say  Boy  Opie  And  Anthony  I  Wonder  If  We've  Got  That  Philosophy  From  Larry  King  Because  That's  Something 
[02:51:00]  We  Completely  Believe  In  I  Got  To  Go  Back  You  Said  You've  Never  Been  Nervous  Since  your  First  Broadcast  I  Don't  Believe  That  All  Those  People  You've  Talked  To  Over  The  Years  No  One  Really  Got  You  Nervous  For  A  Moment  A  Little  Bit  There  Frank  Sinatra  Of  Of  Of  Of  Of  He  Was  Hard  To  Get  And  Jackie  Gleason  Got  Him  For  Me  And  I  Never  Thought  He'd  Show  Up  And  He  Ode  Gleason  A  Favor  And  That's  Why  He  Came  Out  We  Later  Became  Friends  No  I  Never  Nervous  For  Jackie  Jackie  Was  My  Mentor 
[02:51:30]  When  Jackie  Came  Down  To  Miami  They  Rented  A  Train  And  I  Was  On  That  Train  No  Kidding  Yeah  I  Flew  Up  From  Miami  And  I  Flew  Down  And  Then  I  Hosted  The  Welcome  Jackie  Gleason  Dinner  I  Did  A  Lot  Of  MC  That's  Why  Doing  Comedy  Is  Very  Not  New  To  Me  As  I  Stood  On  Stage  With  Him  And  Then  He  Used  To  Come  On  My  Show  Came  On  My  He  Was  In  Insomniac  So  He  Called  In  The  Middle  Of  The  Night  And  He  Came  On  My  Television  Show  First  Time  He  Came  On  He  Changed 
[02:52:00]  The  Whole  Set  He  Didn't  Like  The  Set  So  We  Broke  Into  The  General  Manager's  Office  And  He  Brought  New  Chairs  In  And  He  Lid  It  He  Wanted  It  Lit  Differently  Jackie  Was  A  Genius  We  Love  Jackie  I  Just  Talking  Last  Night  About  The  Honeymooners  Was  On  And  I  Was  Like  You  Know  What  Show  In  This  Day  And  Age  Can  You  Say  In  50  Years  From  Now  Is  Still  Going  To  Be  On  And  Still  Be  Hysterically  Funny  My  Driver  When  I'm  In  New  York  Joe  He  Has  All  The  Tapes  And  He  Plays  Over 
[02:52:30]  And  Over  Again  You  Don't  Get  Sick  They  Never  Lose  He  Let  Me  Sit  In  On  Writers  Meetings  And  It  Was  Really  Wild  To  Watch  Those  Writers  Go  Because  The  Honeymooners  When  You  Think  About  The  Honeymooners  What  Problems  He  Gave  The  Writers  For  Example  Never  Sawed  A  Bedroom  Never  Had  A  Phone  So  You  Could  Never  Introduce
