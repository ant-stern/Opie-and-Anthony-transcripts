<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show's "After ONA Live" segment opened with a discussion of Metta World Peace's premature Happy Labor Day tweet in May, followed by a recounting of his infamous on-court elbow incident.  A caller then shared a graphic anecdote about the dangers of bath salts, describing a face-eating incident attributed to its use.  The conversation shifted to Anthony Cumia's political commentary and its divisive reception among listeners, with a caller using the analogy of selling nickel bags of weed to illustrate economic principles and generational differences in perspective.

Excitement ensued over a possible Bobby Brown sighting near the studio, prompting humorous discussion of a staff member, Jim's, attempts to secure a photograph with the singer.  A significant portion of the segment was dominated by a heated debate about Sam Roberts' wedding seating arrangements.  This led to a shouting match between Roberts, Opie, Anthony, Kenny ("Club Soda Kenny"), and Troy, filled with accusations of selfishness and poor planning, centering around who was responsible for the seating chart and the bride's preferences.

The hosts also discussed Bobo's repeated, unsuccessful attempts to get on the show, and the reasons for their resistance.  Finally, the segment concluded with promotion of a Ricky Gervais short film, "Derek," premiering at the NYShortsFest, along with reminiscences about a past Gervais guest appearance on the show.  The overall tone was comedic, driven largely by the wedding seating chart fiasco and Bobo's ongoing attempts to be on the air, with Jim's Bobby Brown encounter adding to the humor. No guests appeared in studio during this segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Sirius X-H.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Oh yes, oh yes, it's After Opie and Anthony Live.  Live, live.  Hope everybody had a very nice Memorial Day,  or if you were looking at Ron Artest's Twitter,  Metta World Peace, a.k.a. Ron Artest, went on his Twitter 
[00:00:30]  and tweeted out yesterday,  Happy Labor Day to all. Enjoy it.  Wish everybody a May 28th Happy Labor Day.  Well, he's a busy guy.  Maybe. You think he was just doing it in advance?  Yeah, he was probably doing it, you know,  he was running to do a photo shoot or meet with a sponsor or something.  He's trying to get ahead of everything.  He's like, look, I know I'm going to be busy in September.  Remember, this summer, I'm packing in a lot of stuff.  Might as well send this tweet out now.  Maybe he meant to do one of those things. 
[00:01:00]  Maybe he was using one of those, like, computer Twitter apps  where you can program a tweet to go, you know,  in a couple days or in a couple hours or whatever,  and he thought he was programming something to go in September.  Happy Labor Day, y'all. Enjoy it.  Well, we'll let you know how it goes three months from now,  Metta World Peace.  Metta World Peace.  Oh my God.  And what a show today.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  866-969-1969. 
[00:01:30]  Call me up right now and tell me what did you learn.  What did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  I still love that clip of Metta World Peace,  elbowing that guy in his face for no reason.  He just swung back.  Look it up on YouTube if you haven't seen it.  He went so far as to change his name, run our test, basketball player.  He changed his name to Metta World Peace.  And in an interview, actually I think it was in the interview that I did with him with WhoKid,  he said that it was because he wanted to send a good message out there,  and he wanted World Peace to be on the back of his basketball jersey. 
[00:02:00]  So when kids watched him play, they would think of World Peace.  Oh, I thought it sent a good message by elbowing the guy in the head.  Right.  So then, with World Peace written across his back,  he elbows this guy in his jaw as hard as a human possibly can,  and shouts this animalistic shout of joy after he does it.  It was the greatest thing I've ever seen.  Well, what I learned on the Opie and Anthony show was apparently bath salts will fuck you up. 
[00:02:30]  Bath salts, I always thought, this is why I'm glad this show exists,  because I'm learning things as well as you are.  I always thought when people talked about doing bath salts as drugs,  that they were actually bath salts.  Like people were actually going to bed, bath, and body works,  and huffing bath salts to get high.  But no, it's like this whatever methamphetamine it is that they call bath salts.  And I guess it fucks you up crazy,  because there was this one guy who stripped all his clothes off 
[00:03:00]  and started eating another guy's face until a cop had to shoot him multiple times to get off.  So that's what I learned today.  I learned that bath salts will fuck your shit up.  If you're looking to get toasted, man, it's all about bath salts right now.  Charlie in New Jersey, what did you learn on today's Opie and Anthony show?  Hey, what's going on?  How you doing?  You know what I learned?  I learned that if your listeners, me included,  we don't listen to Anthony and get this guy out of the friggin' White House, 
[00:03:30]  we're going to be in deeper shit than we are right now  in four more years than this goes on.  The price of gas is just one thing.  You look at the housing, the stock market, all of our money directly.  It's just that younger people, and I think that's the demo of our show,  your show, kind of in that area, just don't understand about how the cash works.  You look at the stock market, just one little friggin' hiccup,  and the fucking thing goes down 2,000 points. 
[00:04:00]  You know, not 2,000 points, but it goes down.  No, I know what you're saying.  I mean, we did, we witnessed a stock crash not too long ago,  but it is funny watching, I love watching the feedback.  When I get over to this chair and I can see the feedback window that Opie's got open,  and like, it's going like, finally, somebody's speaking the truth.  Ant for Prez.  Ant knows what he's talking about.  And then the next one goes, Ant has no fucking idea what he's talking about.  Ant couldn't sound dumber right now.  Like, it's either Ant is a genius, he knows exactly what he's talking about, 
[00:04:30]  or Ant is somehow making up words as he goes.  Right.  And that's, obviously, you know he's not making up words,  because he is making sense to the older demographic, and that's me.  Do you get, but do you get this information from Ant,  or does he echo your ideas that you already have?  No, I watch CNN, I watch CNBC, I watch Jim Cramer,  I watch the stock market, I know about the price of gas.  I work with commodities.  You know, it's kind of like when you were a little kid.  Right.  Or with me, anyway, 25 years ago. 
[00:05:00]  Not for me.  If you had an ounce of pot, okay, if you had an ounce of pot,  and you cut it into nickel bags, and you sold nickel bags,  some nickel bags are three joints, and some are five joints, right?  Right.  That's how the younger people are going to understand it.  If the guy next to you had a nickel bag, and his nickel bag was five joints,  you're going to buy his, and you're going to get more out of him.  So the point I'm trying to make is that if there's a lot of guys selling nickel bags,  the price is going to go down, and you're going to get better quality, 
[00:05:30]  and that's what the oil is.  You know what?  I call it the law of supply and demand.  The more supply, Charlie, the less demand.  Absolutely.  I've got to tell you something, though.  Speaking of demand, I see a lot of hoopla going on outside the studio,  and I think Bobby Brown may be here.  I don't know if you heard Jim at the end of the show.  He said he had to go try to get a picture with Bobby Brown,  and you know as well as I do that a celebrity picture day for Jim is about as big as it gets. 
[00:06:00]  I don't know what's going on.  All right.  Oh, here's Roland.  All right.  Thank you, Charlie.  All right.  Peace.  Yeah.  I mean, we do get political.  Roland, is that Bobby Brown out there?  Yep.  And success.  Mission accomplished.  Yep.  Mission accomplished.  Woo!  Yeah!  If Jim were in here, he'd be going, who sings this song?  Yeah, pretty much.  He did it.  He got the Bobby Brown picture. 
[00:06:30]  It was getting hairy.  See if we can get it before.  But we got it.  Why was it getting hairy?  Well, because he's waiting for his guest, and then when he's late, so it's like, we got to rush him in.  And Jim was like, no, you don't have to rush him in.  There's one stop he has to make first.  Yeah, man, he goes, well, I have a thing at 1030, so it was pressure, but he got done.  And he just got here?  Yeah.  So he's doing his two radio shows in 15 minutes?  Oh, no, no, no.  Jim has to leave here. 
[00:07:00]  So it was like...  Oh, Jim has to leave at 1030.  Yeah, no.  So Jim's going, look, my time is precious, and I need to get this picture.  Yeah, yeah.  So I love it.  Yeah, you got done.  Jay in Tampa, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Hey, Sam.  Listen, first, I just want to tell you, I hope you have a great wedding.  Good luck with that crew.  Thank you.  What I learned was that, you know, families on the side of the road with the hood open  and the lawn chairs out, it's actually called a spin thing.  I had no idea.  You're right, Jay.  Ant informed us all.  And Mars, that was at the very top of the show, so Jay definitely gets extra credit because 
[00:07:30]  he actually listened to the whole show.  I like when the what did you learn's are something that occurred early on in the show because  it informs people that they missed something.  I was very surprised that Mars was not offended when he came in, when Ant said, so what was  that called, a spicknick?  And he said it just like, he wasn't even thinking that this could possibly offend anybody.  Spicknick.  That is correct, though.  Is that what it's called?  Yeah.  And I guess it's when Hispanic people have their picnics on the side of the highway on 
[00:08:00]  the grass.  Yeah, that's probably true, too.  And we found out that Mars, while he does have a backyard and he wasn't on the side of  the highway, his backyard actually borders the highway.  And whenever he's eating outside, I guess technically it would fall into that category.  Like beans, rice.  But I was surprised that Mars was not even remote.  It didn't even seem remotely offended by it.  He was just like, yeah, whatever.  It's not me. 
[00:08:30]  I pay for my shit.  It happens.  Yeah.  Mike, in New Jersey, what did you learn?  I learned that Ant blurts out a lot of shit and gets on the radio.  Are you of the camp that Ant was blurting out just as much shit as Bill Maher?  Maybe not as much shit, but he's still blurting out shit.  Yeah.  You're falling somewhere in the middle?  Yeah, I think I'd still vote for Ant over the guy that's eating people's faces.  Mike, I don't even know what you're talking about. 
[00:09:00]  There was no...  I'd have to hang up on that guy.  Yes, we did at one point hear from Anthony and his political views.  And yes, we did at one point talk about a guy who ate another guy's face on the side  of the highway.  But those were not the two views that were conflicting with each other.  That wasn't the argument that we were trying to figure out.  Jason, Jason, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show today?  I learned that after Pop and Cialis, Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy want to dance with Rachel 
[00:09:30]  and Hardogs with your mother at your wedding.  Yeah, you did learn that.  That's a good one, Jason.  They did say that.  I learned today that apparently, coming back from...  What was it?  Labor Day or Memorial Day?  I was checking Ron Artest's tweets.  Labor Day.  He said it was Labor Day.  Labor Day, correct.  Okay.  And I did have a great one.  I enjoyed it, thanks to Ron Artest.  But I learned today that apparently my wedding is an extremely compelling topic, because we 
[00:10:00]  certainly spent a lot of time on it today.  I learned you have to redo your seating charts today.  It was, what, from Kenny?  That's what he told me.  Oh my God.  Eric, you had to deal with a lot of this when it was your wedding.  Mm-hmm.  I don't remember if I had organized seating, though.  I think everyone...  You didn't organize seating.  Like everyone, like a seating chart.  I don't think I did that.  What do you mean you didn't do that?  People just go and find a seat?  Yeah, you were there, didn't I?  Did I have cards or something? 
[00:10:30]  You gotta know what table you're sitting at.  Did we do that?  Of course.  You never go to a wedding and say, everybody find a table.  Have you ever been to a wedding?  How many weddings have you been to?  I have.  I've been to a handful.  Okay.  Have you ever been to a wedding where you got into the reception and they said, okay,  just find a spot?  Or did they...  Yeah, one.  But yeah, most of them usually have a seating chart.  You got...  Of course you have a seating chart.  It's Jess mad.  Jess is an...  Here's what happened.  Because Kenny did text her.  He's an idiot.  This club soda Kenny. 
[00:11:00]  Here's what happens.  So, on the air today, we're talking about every detail of my wedding we could possibly talk  about, which was comfortable.  And...  Did they give a location?  No, they might as well have.  Um, and what happened was, we're talking about, uh, we're talking about seating charts.  And, um, Opie is asking who's at his table, right?  So I told them, I'm having, there's going to be three SiriusXM tables.  There's the Opie and Anthony talent table, there's the Opie and Anthony staff table, and there's 
[00:11:30]  the morning mashup table, okay?  That's how we worked it out because that's how many people are per table.  And so, you know, and I said, I'm putting Eastside Dave at the host table because originally  Jess had put you there, E-Rock, and I said, Roland and Troy are going to want to be hanging  with E-Rock.  Do you think I made the right call there?  That's probably true, but I don't think my, uh, I think my wife would rather be hanging 
[00:12:00]  out with, uh, your wife and Mrs. Hughes.  Why is that?  Well, first of all, she's not, your wife's not going to be hanging out with my wife.  My wife's sitting with me at a sweetheart table.  She's the one getting married.  Yeah.  I'm not, you know, but how come, how come your wife would rather sit with, uh, Opie's  wife than any of these schmucks?  Well.  Does she not like Troy?  No, I don't think she has any problem with Troy.  Does she not like me?  No, she's fine with you.  Does she not?  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
[00:12:30]  Who does she like better, me or Troy?  I think she likes you better than Troy.  Troy kind of gets under her skin a little bit?  Some of the stuff he says on the air?  I don't think she thinks about Troy.  That's, that's what I'm, you know.  Does she get annoyed when we, when we rag on you on the air?  Depending on what the subject is.  Hey.  Like the Jersey Devils suck?  Okay, well now you're just trying to say things that annoy Devils's wife.  I don't know why.  Because it hurts my feelings.  Like what is, what, has there ever been like, I'll say something on the air and then you'll  come home and your wife will be like, what the fuck is his problem? 
[00:13:00]  I think the day of my, the Friday before my wedding, when I took off, I think that hit  a sore spot.  That was a rough one.  Yeah.  That was a rough one because I contributed to it.  Uh, yeah, and the fact that she wasn't listening that day, but people pointed it out to her  afterwards.  Yeah, I mean, the wedding is a sensitive time, especially for the, for the lady involved.  Yeah.  Did you care when they were talking about your wedding?  Um, not really, because I figured you would, but I wasn't listening that day either.  Right.  Until, you know, about a week later when I actually heard the show. 
[00:13:30]  And then you were like, come on.  And I'm like, well, that was just hurtful.  We did go a little too far, I think.  But that's why I have to be here if there's a show.  I was talking to Jess about this yesterday.  Well, the door is coming Friday, so.  Yeah.  I was like, if they're doing a show on Friday, I have to be here.  But that's what, yeah, it falls in why we can't take long vacations if the show is on  the air.  And by the way.  Which is the company's fault.  Next week, when I'm not here, my phone's not going to be on because I'm going to be out  of the country.  Bermuda, you have to get long distance, right? 
[00:14:00]  Well, see, the way the show works, it doesn't matter that you're out of the country.  All they do is tell somebody in there, like, hey, Eric's staying.  And then he said what he said.  All right, then I'm probably not going to.  And then they call the front desk and boom.  Then I'm not going to tell anybody where my hotel is.  But I'm not going to have my phone on.  So we'll see.  It doesn't matter.  We'll see how that works out.  You think it matters in this show?  It doesn't matter if you have a phone.  I mean, they can't call you if you don't have a phone.  They'll call the hotel.  Well, are you staying near King's Wharf out there?  I have no idea, actually.  I don't.  I'll find you. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, really?  You just start calling hotels?  I told you.  You're just going to start calling hotels until you find me?  Hmm.  How are you doing, Jim?  I heard you got a picture.  You got your picture.  Yeah, he was very nice.  Yeah?  We said hello.  And Anthony was really helpful.  I mean, he introduced me.  And Bobby's like, yeah, he was very friendly.  Not our Anthony.  No, I don't know his name.  He's a booker here.  Yeah, though.  What's that?  Anthony Lopez.  Anthony Lopez.  Yeah.  Do you know Bobby Brown at all?  I've never met him.  No, I mean, like, his music.  My prerogative.  Oh, okay. 
[00:15:00]  Because Eric played a Bobby Brown song in Celebration.  He's strong.  He's a, he's like a stronger feeling guy than you would expect.  Really?  Yeah, like, he feels like he's been in the gym.  Like, he's not.  I always think of him as this small guy from New Edition.  Uh-huh.  That, you know, just that's how I always knew him.  Um, but if we played this song, you'd be like, who the fuck is this?  I'd do it.  Right.  If he sang it to me, I wouldn't recognize it.  But it was, uh, but he was friendly. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  You know, he had that smell a little like he had been partying a little bit, you know.  Oh, really?  Just a little bit.  It's not a bad smell, though.  It's not like a, it's not gross or dirty.  It's just like that.  Right.  Like he'd just been partying a little bit last night.  Yeah, yeah, fun night.  We were trying to figure out if, uh, Eric's wife gets upset when, uh, people talk about  him on the air.  Like, Troy.  Because, uh, yeah, because, like, he said that she doesn't dislike me, but he said that  she specifically likes me more than Troy.  Well, probably, because there's been what sounds like genuine aggression from Troy. 
[00:16:00]  Right.  Like, I never understood why Jess hated me.  Um, she didn't, she never hated you.  But she didn't, first of all, if she didn't know you, if she hadn't met you.  Oh, shit.  Motherfucker.  Who's calling you?  Hello?  See, this, Jim always brings up, Jess used to hate me, and then I tried to explain it,  and he does something like that.  Where he glides out of the room.  But, like, if you're, Eric, if your wife, there you go.  What is the address here?  1221 Avenue of America.  Yeah. 
[00:16:30]  Come visit us, people.  Yeah!  Um, but if your wife, if your wife didn't know Jim, and he was just on the air,  saying, oh, I hope horrible things happen at your wedding, and she had never met him,  wouldn't she probably not be like, oh, he seems like a great guy?  Well, if she hadn't met him.  If she hadn't met him.  But she knew that he's on the show that we work on.  But that's all she knows.  She doesn't know the other side.  I was just telling.  I guess.  That was my boneyard guest.  I was just telling Eric, Jess never hated you. 
[00:17:00]  Okay.  But she didn't have a reason to, like, think that you were a great guy.  Why not?  I'm funny and I treat you nicely.  You treat me nicely, but all I can do is tell her that.  All she hears is you on the air and saying things like, oh, I hope horrible things happen  to your wedding.  Oh, for sure.  Fair enough.  So, you can understand where somebody would get the wrong impression.  Where's my paper that was here?  Oh, we put it off to the side there for you.  It's all there, I hope.  Yeah, my guest tonight is on the boneyard, Lady Starlight.  Who's that?  She used to DJ with Lady Gaga. 
[00:17:30]  She used to tour there.  Oh.  And she's a big, I met her at the Zach Wilde roast.  Mm-hmm.  And she's a big fucking, like, metal head and I never knew that.  Oh, really?  So.  Is she a rock DJ or is she a dance DJ?  Yeah, I think she is.  Yeah, no, she DJed all rock stuff on Zach's.  I didn't know how much she liked metal.  So I'm like, yeah, come on the show.  And so she's actually coming up now.  We're going to pre-tape for tonight.  Was that the first time you met her at the roast?  I didn't know who she was, yeah.  And I was, like, kind of attracted to her.  Yeah.  Certainly didn't feel mutual.  No?  No.  Well, maybe you didn't get a chance to talk to her.  Maybe today is the day for you to kind of put your charm on. 
[00:18:00]  The way you made Jess see what a wonderful human being you are.  Yeah, but Jess was only because I wore certain slacks and I pumped myself.  It's always about you and your bones.  Yeah, you're right, you're right.  That's probably unfair.  That probably is a bit much.  It always comes down to you wearing white spandex.  All right.  I'm going to go piss.  I'll see you later.  Okay.  Oh, good luck with Lady Starlight.  Is that it?  That's her name, yeah.  Lady Starlight.  Well, who was Lady first?  Her or Gaga?  I don't know.  I'm going to ask her that.  Write it down.  First question. 
[00:18:30]  Write it down.  I don't need to.  It's all up here.  It's a steel trap up there.  Yeah.  Huh?  All right.  Have a good time.  Yeah.  I'm going to make some jokes.  Oh, Chip, you're...  Go Lady Starlight.  What are you, what are you, like, is it the moon around or something?  Maybe stay off the boneyard altogether.  Ah, fucking boneyard.  I'm going to go, what is it, a bunch of bones around here?  I got one for you, and then...  Fuck you, don't say that.  Yeah, she'd fuck you.  I can say whatever I want.  I got a bug.  Hold on.  Oh, he's picking his nose. 
[00:19:00]  You revolting, Chip.  Have a good day.  Um, so does...  But your wife, other than that, she doesn't really take exception to me making jokes at  your expense.  She understands what's going on, I hope.  Uh, yeah, for the most part.  Not always?  She's like...  There might be some situations, but...  Like what?  Other than the wedding.  I can't recall off the top of my head.  I have to think about it.  But sometimes she goes like, does he really have to be that much of a dick?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's fair.  That's fair.  Where is Troy? 
[00:19:30]  Is he hiding?  I think he's recording Jimmy for the Boneyard.  Oh, he's a chicken.  I don't think he's a chicken.  Um, but she...  And she doesn't think about Troy, or does she...  I mean, because Troy...  Jim was right.  Troy comes in here aggressive.  Mm-hmm.  You know what I mean?  Does she not...  What is she...  She doesn't think about that one way or the other?  No, I don't think she really thinks about Troy.  She has no problem with him.  But Troy's been in your life for years.  Yeah.  And she has no opinion on him whatsoever.  I don't think she gets to hear Troy on the air that much. 
[00:20:00]  Oh.  We're talking about Eric's wife.  Oh.  We were saying, because I asked if Eric's wife...  I said, does Eric...  Does your wife not like Troy?  Yeah.  And he said she doesn't even think about you.  Which I guess...  Yeah, that's not a bad thing.  No?  I guess not.  Does she think about Sam?  Well, she hears Sam all the time.  But she doesn't hear me.  She doesn't hear you on the show all that much.  Oh, okay.  But he's on the show a bunch.  She doesn't listen five hours.  Hmm.  She just listens...  No, you can tune in at any point and there's a chance that you're going to be on the air. 
[00:20:30]  Well, I don't want to toot my own horn, but...  Nobody's tooting your horn.  Oh.  It's just saying that you're there.  Just constituting facts.  Troy comes in when there's, you know, segments about Troy or something that he's involved in.  Does she listen to the after show?  Um, I think she's working at this time.  What the fuck?  Why wouldn't she listen to the show?  She might.  She's texting me while the show's on before.  Oh, then she might.  She might hear pieces of it.  Does she ever, like, go home and be like, oh, Sam said something really funny today and  talk to you about that?  No, that never comes up.  She never said that?  No.  That's disappointing. 
[00:21:00]  She just says Sam didn't do a prerecord or something.  Oh.  That's disappointing.  Well, you know what?  Tell her that that's because the client sends stuff to her husband and to Sam, and as far  as I'm concerned, her husband can take the lead on that shit.  And when her husband leaves a little early to catch in a little extra episode of He-Man  or whatever DVD he's watching, fair is fair, right?  Um, well, I mean, I guess she doesn't think he one way or the other, then...  That's good.  She doesn't think bad of him. 
[00:21:30]  Right.  Saturday's gonna be fun, though.  You think so?  Yeah.  Eric said that he thinks his wife would rather sit with the talent.  What, just because she's actually friends with Obie's wife?  Mm-hmm.  I see.  I think he'd rather sit with the girls, then.  Like, she's heard and seen and witnessed Roland's mannerisms as far as sitting at a  table.  Well, there was...  Fair enough.  How he drinks.  Very fair, very fair.  And there was the one time...  100%.  100%.  She's right.  ...at your birthday party...  That's exactly what I was gonna bring up.  Where Roland drank...  She's right.  ...Roland drank to excess, and while you were sitting next to your wife and thanking everybody for 
[00:22:00]  coming, Roland leaned over the table and yelled, may you get some pussy tonight at the top  of his lungs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's very, very correct.  Yeah, she is right about that.  I was sitting at the other table, too, if I was her, yes.  Yeah.  Well, I think she's gonna be at the table where we put her at, and I would hope that she would  have the good taste not to walk up and down the hallways of this office and text all parties  involved because they're concerned about the seating chart.  She would never do that.  No.  That's kidding.  She knows that she's been to weddings before. 
[00:22:30]  She's had a wedding.  It's nobody's business but the bride and groom where anybody is sitting.  Why?  Who's complaining?  This is what happened.  Well, yeah, and you're only sitting there for a little bit.  Get up and get on the dance floor if you don't like where you're sitting.  Like, you have your, uh, what are they, the first, the appetizer, and then all of a  sudden you get up and dance for a little bit, then you go back for the main course,  then you go back for the cake.  You know what I learned?  I'm gonna taste the cake before.  There's two different types of wedding, Troy.  We're doing a New York type of wedding.  But there's also a Connecticut type of wedding where they sit, you go in, you do the first  dance, and then you sit down, and you eat all your courses, and then you get up and 
[00:23:00]  dance again, as opposed to dancing between the courses.  That's cool.  We're gonna be dancing between courses.  Good.  That's the way it should be, I think.  But, Opie was asking me about the seating charts on the air this morning, and I was telling  him kind of where everybody was sitting.  Like I said, there's the talent table, there's the staff table, there's the morning mashup  table.  That's just the way the numbers worked out.  And I put Eric at the staff table with Roland and Troy and their dates and all that stuff. 
[00:23:30]  So, and I was telling Opie and Anthony and Jim that they would be joined by Eastside Dave  and his lovely wife, and Club Soda Kenny and his, I'm assuming, lovely wife.  He hasn't confirmed with me who his date will be, but I'm assuming it's his lovely wife.  Opie, I think he was joking.  Maybe he wasn't joking.  He was requesting that we trade out Kenny.  Kenny, he said, I don't want to sit with Kenny.  He's not even gonna know there's a wedding going on, blah, blah, blah.  That's not nice.  It's not nice, no.  I'm sure it hurt his feelings, too.  It probably did hurt Kenny.  So, are you treating the Kenny for the niggles? 
[00:24:00]  No.  Swap him out?  As I told Kenny, it doesn't matter who Opie thinks should be traded out.  Like, if he thought Kenny should not be in this studio.  I don't think it affects your gift.  I don't care.  Yeah, you do.  No, I don't.  Yeah, you do.  No, I don't.  You do just what I do.  Yeah, well, see who's sitting at what table and find out if I care.  I'll take Kenny.  I'm not trading him.  Just go ahead.  Out of principle, I'm not trading him.  I think you should.  No, I'm not going to because it's my decision.  And nobody's gonna sit around here. 
[00:24:30]  Once you find out who's sitting at which table, your job as a guest is to say, okay,  not, you know what we should do and try to figure out.  So Club Story Kenny hears Opie saying this, and I told Kenny, it doesn't matter whether  Opie is approving or not approving.  Kenny's already been placed at the table.  That's where he'll sit.  Kenny starts walking up and down these SiriusXM hallways telling anyone who will listen,  did you hear?  Sam's putting blah, blah, blah, and laying out, we told you before. 
[00:25:00]  Remember when we talked about this, that Kenny has this thing where he's got one little  gossip tidbit, and half the time he makes it up, and that's what he's deciding that  he's going to be telling everybody he encounters for the rest of the morning.  Troy isn't like Pimp Dutcher wedding.  So today, it was the seating chart thing, and he's telling everybody.  Then, he texts Jess.  Like, four days before somebody's wedding, a bride wants to hear from Club Soda Kenny about 
[00:25:30]  problems with the seating chart from Kenny.  But he has his concerns.  I don't care.  Club Soda Kenny.  Yeah, it wasn't like the morning of.  I had some courtesy.  I did it four days before.  No, Kenny, you have no jurisdiction over where you sit.  You sit where you're sat.  No, listen, G.H. said he doesn't want to sit with me, so I'm just trying to accommodate him.  I understand.  I know you're an accommodating guy, and that your job description is to accommodate that man, 
[00:26:00]  and I respect that.  But G.H. Opie also has no jurisdiction over who sits where.  Sam, you're being stubborn.  You should listen to your friends.  The consensus is you're making a mistake.  And me being a good friend of yours, I don't want to see your special day ruined.  You don't have a wedding planner, so just let me handle it.  How about I let me and Jess handle it?  No, no, you're making a big mistake, Sam.  You're not thinking outside the box. 
[00:26:30]  Who are you going to the wedding with?  Who's your date?  No, you just worry about you, and let me worry about everything else.  Okay, well, how about this?  How about you worry about you, and let me worry about everything else?  Since I'm one of the ones getting top billing at this wedding.  I don't know why this is such an issue.  Opie doesn't want Club Soda at the table.  Swap it down.  The Nagels don't want to be at our table.  They'd rather be over there.  Kenny would rather be over at our table.  What's the problem?  Boom.  Because it's my choice.  It's my decision.  The decision's been made.  But don't you want people to have a good time? 
[00:27:00]  People will have a good time.  And don't you think it's funnier that Anthony, Jim, and Opie have to get stuck with Eric?  Eric, do you feel like they have to get stuck?  They're not getting stuck.  I wasn't put at that table.  Do you think Opie wants to sit with you?  I don't think Opie wants any.  He wants those two chairs empty next to him.  I don't think Anthony wants to sit with you.  He wants to put his iPad and camera right there.  What?  He doesn't mind.  I don't know.  Look.  I think you should ask them tomorrow.  Let them vote.  Because it's their table.  It's not their table. 
[00:27:30]  It's my table that they're sitting at.  Every table in that venue is my table.  All of them.  Troy and I, we vote Kenny.  We'll take him.  Yeah, we'll take him.  And exactly.  Rolling there.  Here's what you do.  We vote Kenny.  Kenny votes to come over.  Here's what I want you to do then.  Here's what you do.  When you get to that wedding, make the switch yourself.  Okay.  You're in America.  There's going to be a number on the...  I don't know what table number it's going to be.  But Kenny...  The number on Kenny's card is going to match Opie, Anthony, Jim, and Eastside Dave.  And the number on Eric's card is going to match Troy, Roland, Stinky, Monica, and all those folks. 
[00:28:00]  I think you're being a little selfish.  Let me.  Because guess what?  Yeah.  Guess what?  Troy, you know what else, Troy?  He's sticking his high school friends, and he's dividing the serious employees with his high school friends.  His high school friends are going to hate him and resent him for that.  Yeah, that was a big concern of Kenny's as well.  Number one...  I don't think you're thinking this through as well as you should.  Number one, half of the...  Most of the people on the two Opie and Anthony tables want nothing to do with the morning mashup. 
[00:28:30]  That's just fair.  That's not true.  It's just you, Kenny.  Most of the people don't want anything to do with him.  So put Kenny at the mashup table.  Is that where you want to be, Kenny?  No, Kenny wants to be at our table.  All right, Kenny, do you want me to put you at the mashup table?  No, I want to be at the court.  All right, so don't bring up the mashup table again.  What?  Because I'm not going to sit my friends from high school further away from the dance floor  than the morning fucking mashup.  You're the only ones being an asshole about this.  No, you're being a fucking asshole, and so is Kenny. 
[00:29:00]  Just move Kenny over.  Yeah.  Look, Eric, the Nagels want to go over.  We want Kenny here.  We're only once Kenny there.  And it's funnier that Anthony, Opie, and Jim have to deal with Eric.  What?  First of all, I think it's funny.  Because Kenny's going to be funnier than Eric.  Not if his wife is there.  What?  That makes Eric a fucking comedian when it's around?  No.  What makes Eric a comedian is Roland getting fucking drunk and saying some stupid shit to Eric.  Yeah, but that'll happen regardless.  You think so?  Oh, yeah.  I'll say that to everybody.  Stupid shit.  I had said that something, he's going to open his mouth, Roland. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Remember, because we went out to have dinner the other night.  I said, Roland's going to say something that's going to dramatically change the course of  somebody's life at that wedding.  Just by...  I tried.  I tried.  If Eric's at the other table, it's better now because Roland has to yell it across the  room.  Exactly.  You'd like to see that happen.  Now, let me ask you this.  That's a good point.  Let me ask you this, Troy.  Go ahead.  I'm not going to be sitting at the table.  I'm not going to be able to instigate everything that I want to go on.  If Eric is at the other table, can I trust you to push Roland's buttons until Roland is 
[00:30:00]  yelling across the other table?  Are you fucking kidding me?  Of course.  Here's what my response then is.  I got to go.  Jim's here to record.  You guys can trade tables all you want once you get there.  But the decision's been made.  I had no problem with the table I was assigned to.  You know, because you understand.  I said nothing about this.  You're good at either table.  I'm fine wherever I'm at.  Right.  That's the way a wedding guest should be. 
[00:30:30]  Just not with the mashup.  No.  Why would you want to be with them?  No.  They're fun.  They're fun.  I'd say we make everybody happy.  How about this?  We make me happy, and that's all that matters because it's my wedding.  We could try that.  That's selfish.  Yeah, it is a little selfish, isn't it?  Kenny, if you can find someone to trade seats with you, feel free.  Dave, you don't get married to be happy.  What do you get married for?  It beats me. 
[00:31:00]  I haven't figured it out yet.  Look, Kenny, Jess and I are in a blissful relationship.  We are getting married to be happy, and we are not going to start kowtowing to outrageous  demands now.  I'll be cleaning the glasses for a speech.  You will be.  Yeah, but Sam, you're overlooking the most important thing.  What's that?  What a great shitstorm I started.  Just for no reason.  For no reason. 
[00:31:30]  Well, I have nothing else to do today.  You do.  You just have so much free time.  Well, that's not true because Kenny had also mentioned that he was trying to try to figure  out what he should say in his speech.  You don't get to do a speech, Kenny.  Why can't he do a speech?  I'll do a speech if he does a speech.  Nobody knows what you're saying, Roland, and if I told you you could do a speech, you  would panic and not do it anyway.  I would?  Yes.  I'm going to be drunk and do it.  You're just going to get drunk and grab a microphone?  Hell yeah.  I'll have you escorted from the process immediately.  Or he'll get drunk and say, no, he couldn't go to your wedding. 
[00:32:00]  He had to go to the movies.  Well, if there's a Harry Potter thing.  That's true.  You didn't go to Eric's wedding, and he asked you to be his best man.  I've still got four days.  Yeah, Kenny.  Are you going to podcast your wedding?  That's a good point.  You really should, Sam.  Well, I mean, certain elements will be recorded, and if there's anything worthwhile, I'll be  able to pull the audio and broadcast them later.  No, I'll have a live podcast.  No, I'm not going to broadcast my wedding live.  No. 
[00:32:30]  Why?  I bet you the fans would love that.  I'm sure they would, but the venue's not even equipped for a live broadcast.  No, well, we've got four days to make it happen.  I'm not going to worry about that, actually.  I think I'm just going to make sure that it's a wonderful time for Jess, myself, and  our guests in attendance.  Yeah, and I'm one of the guests.  Right.  And like I said, if you feel so strongly that you want to trade seats, go right ahead.  I'm just trying to help you out. 
[00:33:00]  You're not trying to help me out.  You're trying to fill the void that is your waking life.  Same, different.  It does get long.  These days do get long for you sometimes, don't they, Kenny?  Yeah, when it's hot and humid, it's even worse.  Yeah, what do you got planned for today?  I'm driving home.  And then?  I mean, that takes us to 1048.  Yeah, I don't know.  You know, I'll go to the gym, an asium.  Oh, okay. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, and, you know, we'll see what else the day brings.  Well, I can't wait to see you, Kenny.  Thank you for the call.  All right, thank you for letting me talk.  All right, goodbye.  Goodbye.  Look, Kenny will sit where he's seated.  And if you want to trade seats, Eric, feel free.  But I don't give a fuck.  I was fine with where you put me.  Yeah.  I think he's going to go there, be Eric to the table.  That's funny. 
[00:34:00]  So what's going on with Ricky Gervais, Roland?  He's in the short film festival?  Yes.  It starts today through the 31st.  All right, so it's the Ricky Gervais and Carl.  Yeah.  Plinkington, is that how you pronounce it?  Peltington.  Peltington?  It's not Peltington.  No, I think it's Plinkington.  Yeah, it's definitely not Peltington.  Let me correct you, Sam.  It is Peltington?  Yes, sir.  You know Carl from Idiot Abroad and Ricky Gervais.  They're in a short film together.  It premieres tonight.  You can go to NYShortsFest.com. 
[00:34:30]  NYShortsFest.com.  It's very similar to the website where Roland buys all his pants from.  NYShortsFest.com.  It's in New York, obviously, so you can still get tickets, and the short film is called  Derek.  Yeah.  I don't know what it's about.  Do you have any idea?  This aired over in the UK already, right?  Yeah.  You get it?  Yeah, it got a lot of good reviews.  What's it about?  I'm not sure.  Do you know, Eric?  I used to.  It's a...  Let me look it up.  A lot of people are tweeting overseas how great it was.  Yeah. 
[00:35:00]  Well, I mean, Ricky Gervais has yet to have a flop, so check it out if you get a chance.  It's at NYShortsFest.com, right?  Is it Fest?  And it's in our Facebook, too.  The Open Anthony.  Okay, yeah.  So go to Facebook.com slash OpenAnthony, and you can get tickets and all that.  Oh, okay.  What?  It says...  It's about a guy who's 49 years old who loves autograph hunting.  Oh, I think, you know what?  Either him... 
[00:35:30]  I think he...  Did he talk about that the last time?  He talked about this the last time he was here.  I think it was just starting in the UK.  Yeah.  Or it had just started in the UK when he came on the show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I remember him talking about that the last time he was in.  So I guess this was maybe it started as a pilot, and now it's going to be turning into a short film?  Maybe.  Yeah, it's a 26-minute short film.  Very interesting.  The other thing that I learned on the Open Anthony show today is that I think it's official.  We've gotten phone calls from him in the office. 
[00:36:00]  I know our talent bookers, not just Roland, but the SiriusXM talent bookers such as Liam, have gotten phone calls from him.  I've gotten Facebook messages from him, all saying, when can I get back on the show?  When can I get back on the show?  Open Anthony picked up his phone call today, and they let Bobo know, we've got nothing for you.  I don't know what it is, but Bobo cannot, and we talked about this a little bit on Thursday when Otto and Big A were in here. 
[00:36:30]  Bobo just can't realize that if we have a bit for you, we'll call you.  We got your phone number, and we're not ever going to forget about Bobo.  As much as many of us wish that we could, we will never forget about Bobo.  Can we try?  We can try.  We can think about as many other things as humanly possible, but it's just not going to happen.  If something comes up, and we'll go, oh, we can use Bobo for that.  But beyond that, he can't realize that we just don't want to talk to him anymore. 
[00:37:00]  You know, have you, has he ever actually called you, Roland?  I give him Liam's number every time he calls.  Yeah.  He calls me.  Every time he goes, what's your number?  I just give him Liam's number.  And Liam feels bad for him.  And I guess everybody feels a little bad for him, but it's like, like Liam's like, but  then people come up to us, and they're like, like Liam goes, come on, you guys are being  dicks.  And I go, what are you talking about?  And he goes, well, you won't let him on the show.  It's not a charity.  This isn't Make-A-Wish. 
[00:37:30]  And Liam's a fancy, says everybody's being dicks.  Bobo tells him that?  No, that's what Liam says.  Oh, he just says it to whoever.  Like, it's not, we don't just let people on the show because we feel bad for them.  We let people on the show because potentially we think that they may be able to provide  good content.  I don't know.  But that's the story with Bobo.  Also, um, Roland, we were talking about this over dinner on Sunday.  We met up on Sunday. 
[00:38:00]  It was the, uh, we weren't invited to Eric's house party party.  It wasn't a house party.  Well, was it a party in your house?  No, it was more like a dinner.  It was a gathering.  Gathering?  Is that the word, Roland?  Yeah, but I, Eric told me during the commercial break, because we talked about this on the  air about not getting invited.  Eric told me that his wife invited my fiancee, which isn't, I mean.  She invited both of you.  That's neither here nor there.  In which your fiancee said you had some stuff you were still getting ready for the wedding. 
[00:38:30]  You'd like to, but you can't.  But how come you can't invite me somewhere?  How come you can't be like, hey, Sam, I'd really like it if you came.  Because I was already told she invited you guys.  That's not very friendly.  So why was I going to do it again?  That's just not friendly.  And, I mean, you know, I was under the-  I told you you were going to come, you would be invited to the housewarming party.  I just, I might be uncomfortable for me.  I don't know if I'm going to go.  All right, then.  Which table will I be sitting at? 
[00:39:00]  Well, I had to get final approval over all seating.  I'm going to have you sitting with Kenny.  But I don't like that.  I don't like that at all.  But we were there at dinner.  And the reason we were really at dinner, we were just busting your balls, Eric.  The reason we were really at dinner is because we spent the weekend trying to figure out whether or not we were invited to Ant's Compact Party.  Roland, Troy, and me are just texting each other going, are you going to go tonight?  Like, we didn't know if it was on Saturday or Sunday.  And we were like, well, I don't know.  He was tweeting pictures of girls over at his house. 
[00:39:30]  Should we just go?  I don't know.  Did he say you could go?  Well, he didn't specifically say.  Well, he didn't specifically say I could go.  Plus, we'll crash Eric's party to get your feet wet.  And then go to Anthony's party.  Yeah, we were thinking about going to dinner and then just all showing up at your new house, Eric.  That would have been fine.  That would have been fine.  Yeah, I would have laughed.  But I feel like, in hindsight, I wish we had gone to Anthony's party.  Now we know we were invited.  Did you hear him on the air today in the first hour?  Yeah, I didn't know.  I didn't want to walk in like, hey.  And like, hey.  What is he doing here? 
[00:40:00]  But I feel like now he's made it abundantly clear and he announced it on the air.  He said it.  I don't know if he said it about you, Eric.  I cannot vouch for you right now.  Oh, he said accept me.  He did.  He specifically said accept you.  That's not nice, is it?  Eh, so be it.  No, he said accept me.  He specifically said, Roland, for you, me, and Troy, that we have the open invite when he has a party.  And he didn't say it as like a sort of like brush off thing. 
[00:40:30]  He said specifically, we're on the list.  Okay, that's good.  Now, but what are we going to do?  Because we didn't even know when the party was.  I know.  So we have to text Anthony.  We're a bunch of sissy nannies.  Yeah.  You tell him.  No, you text him.  You call him.  Every weekend we're going to have to text Anthony and be like, hey, are you having a party?  Is it fun?  Can we come?  Please.  Because we don't know.  We just have to watch the Twitter feed and wait until the drunk karaoke alerts go up.  And like the bat signal, it will beckon us and we will go. 
[00:41:00]  You've only been to one compound party, right, Roland?  Yeah.  Did you have a good time?  I loved it.  Yeah.  It's always fun at Anthony's house.  He's just got this like adult Wonka factory where it's this.  It's not chocolate.  It's booze.  Right.  It's this great big house.  All the booze in the world.  You lick the wallpapers.  It tastes like Jack Daniels.  It's amazing.  And food.  And food.  And he's got this giant grill and somebody's always grilling.  Danny was grilling last time we were there.  And the food is delicious.  He's got the pool.  He's got the hot tub. 
[00:41:30]  And you're hanging out outside.  He's got the massive living room.  All is great, right?  He's got the nice open kitchen.  And then you don't even realize what fun is to be had downstairs.  Because you walk downstairs and all in what for a normal person would just be a basement  where you throw your shit and it's all rotted out with water and everything.  It's this beautiful, finished, carpeted, awesome place where you look in one direction.  And first, there's the full-out radio slash television studio. 
[00:42:00]  Then you've got your popcorn machine, which is right outside your full-fledged luxury movie theater,  across from the karaoke stage, which is down from the full-serviced bar.  Beer on taps.  On tap, Roland.  And he keeps it updated.  Ice cold, too.  And he always keeps it fresh.  He's got the keg guy coming over all the time.  It really is an amazing place.  That's why I'm glad to have officially gotten the invite.  And we have to text like women.  Yeah, except we are just going to have to text like women and go, 
[00:42:30]  Hey, so what day is your party?  Are you having a party?  Is there going to be a cheese and crackers get-together right before the party?  Or is it more starting on time?  Or what do you plan on doing?  Are you going to bring a gift the first time you go?  Like a little bottle of wine or a cheese and crackers plate or something like that?  I bring pie.  Everybody loves pie.  Are you going to swim?  I don't swim.  You don't swim?  I just walk swim.  You can doggy paddle?  Pretty much.  Why don't you learn to swim? 
[00:43:00]  You've got a pool in your building.  I know, but it's not that deep, so.  What do you mean it's not that deep?  Isn't it a pool?  Yeah.  How deep does it go?  Probably up to my neck.  It's got to...  If it's a pool, it's got to go over six feet.  Yeah.  So you're not six feet tall.  No, but I go to the cello end.  The cello end.  Isn't that that bread that Jewish people eat?  Challa?  Challow end?  There's a deep end, though.  I know.  You may find me all the way up there, too.  Like, chip and all that.  Well, you pronounce your S-H's like C-H's. 
[00:43:30]  So, your pool doesn't go that deep.  Yeah.  But that's because you don't leave the cello end.  That's true.  That's true.  The little bastards, the kids have their floaties.  I'm like, ah.  Aren't you worried about, like, piss in the pool?  Especially in the cello end.  Nah.  I love piss, too.  You piss in the pool?  Good for you.  Listen.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  I'm glad to be back here and to be experiencing all this with you again.  We'll be back with more of this tomorrow. 
[00:44:00]  I hope Kenny is on better terms with his seating chart and all that, because I can't deal with all this then.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Goodbye, everybody.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ron and Fez are next.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey! </pre>
