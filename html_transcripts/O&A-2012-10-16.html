<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of the upcoming presidential debate between Obama and Romney.  The hosts offered their opinions on the candidates, criticized Hillary Clinton regarding Benghazi, lambasted the town hall debate format, and expressed contempt for undecided voters.  The conversation digressed into discussions of the film *Suspiria*, Hillary Clinton's hair, and Candy Crowley's perceived liberal bias.  They then heavily criticized Alex Rodriguez for allegedly flirting with women in the stands during a Yankees game and sending them notes via a ball boy.

Next, the show moved on to Bubba the Love Sponge's legal troubles stemming from Hulk Hogan's $100 million lawsuit over a leaked sex tape. A clip from the lawsuit announcement was played, and the hosts discussed the details and their reactions.  This discussion of the Hogan lawsuit reappeared later in the show, with a lengthy excerpt of Bubba's commentary played and further analysis of his shifting explanations and hypocritical behavior. The hosts repeatedly used crude language and sexually explicit descriptions, speculating on Bubba's motives and the potential consequences for all involved, including Hogan, Bubba, Heather Clem, and those who leaked the tape.  A caller named Iraq voiced his anger at Bubba's actions.  Scott Shannon's potential involvement was also briefly discussed.  The recurring "turd" sound effect was frequently used throughout this segment.  Mentions of other wrestlers, like Macho Man Randy Savage, and wrestling culture were also woven in.

The show also featured a segment reviewing several new songs from veteran rock bands: the Rolling Stones ("Doom and Gloom"), Aerosmith ("Love Her a Lot"), and Kiss ("Hell or Hallelujah").  The hosts debated the merits of each song, comparing them to older works and other artists like Escape Club. They also criticized a Rolling Stones video for "Waiting on a Friend" and speculated on why Kevin James hadn't been a guest on the show, given a recent poorly performing Kevin James movie. A caller, Bill, suggested listening to a new Aerosmith song.  A significant portion of this segment involved playing and discussing a clip of an interview between President Obama and Michael Yo, where Obama mentioned Nicki Minaj, leading to a discussion and playing of some of her music.

Later, guest Vic Henley joined the show.  The conversation began with banter about 80s metal before Henley shared stories about his friend taking a KKK hood from a Klansman, and his getting fired from Caesars Palace after a dispute with the Judds, deliberately sabotaging his final performance.  He also recounted a similar story involving comedian Greg Rogel.  The hosts and Henley then transitioned into "Jocktober," a segment focusing on the Canadian radio show C-103 Breakfast Club, playing clips and making sexually suggestive and offensive remarks about the hosts, Ernie, Mandy, and Tater.  They commented on offensive images from the C-103 Breakfast Club's Facebook page (which was taken down during the broadcast), featuring altered photos of Kiss members and Hulk Hogan.  The segment concluded with further discussion of the C-103 Breakfast Club, jokes, Henley's upcoming shows, and a Dish Network commercial.  E-Rock also made a brief appearance. The hosts also mentioned their upcoming plans, including the mention of a Denver Broncos game and  future segments, as well as the impending appearance of  Henry Winkler.  Finally, Jim Norton's upcoming comedy shows were also discussed.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  It's two for Tuesday.  Two for Tuesday.  Is it? Yeah, man.  Ah, fuck.  Do we have a standard good morning for everybody? Because it's just weird.  Yeah.  I know we say this a lot and we talk about it a lot lately.  I kind of like that we have no clue how to tell people that it's good morning. 
[00:00:30]  Good morning.  Morning.  There you go.  To you.  And yours.  And yours.  And yours.  Yeah.  That works.  That works.  Ha, ha, noises.  Ha, ha, noises.  Yeah, we're just talking about debate tonight.  Yes, in Hofstra.  It's big in the news at Hofstra, right?  Out on Long Island.  One of these assholes flying in. 
[00:01:00]  I don't know.  To ruin our commute.  I didn't even think about that whole thing.  Oh, God, yeah.  Damn, where do they stay?  Out on Long Island?  There's nowhere really to stay out there on Long Island.  Man, maybe in the dorm?  Maybe.  Let's stay at the Hofstra dorm?  Ah, probably the same hotel right next to the Coliseum.  Oh, yeah?  The islanders stay?  Islander fans and the away people stay.  Right in the heart of Uniondale.  Yeah, Uniondale is a shithole.  That really is.  Uniondale is not a fun area.  Crappy town. 
[00:01:30]  I don't know.  They're in there debating.  You would think they would get in nice and early, settle in.  Settle in.  Go over their notes.  Look at Governor Romney.  He's settling down.  Yeah, he's...  Obama's got to step up, I gather.  This is a pretty big debate.  I think so.  The numbers have definitely swung a little toward Romney compared to what they were.  And this Libya thing was very big in chip what? 
[00:02:00]  What's that?  Chipping away?  That Libya thing was big for some people.  Oh, it's pretty fucking big.  I like how right before the debate, too, fucking Clinton falls on the...  All the numbers are looking good?  No, Clinton falls on the sword about that.  Well, you wanted someone to take responsibility, someone takes responsibility, and that's not  even good enough for you.  Not the person that fucking...  The Secretary of State, stop it.  She's taking responsibility.  You wanted someone to step up, someone stepped up.  Well, you can't just have someone take responsibility, and then that exonerates everybody above her. 
[00:02:30]  It's a good start.  Well, it's a good start, but I still think that that really points out a lack of a clear  foreign policy on the part of President Obama.  Obama, yeah, okay, Bin Laden's dead, we get it.  Yeah, he can fucking sign...  You can't just say we get it.  He can sign a piece of paper that sends fucking drones over and drops some Hellfire missiles  on people.  But we can't say we get it.  No, we can say we get it. 
[00:03:00]  That was a big one.  But it wasn't purely Obama.  I think it was all Obama.  You know, he likes taking responsibility for that, but as far as Benghazi goes, he's not  fucking, you know...  Well, it's an election year.  Exactly.  And we're three weeks out.  You can't start, you know, you gotta keep all that on the QT for a while.  Yeah.  That's how that shit works.  You know that.  Well, yeah, exactly.  I've never seen such shuffling as I have on the part of the Obama administration.  Aren't you annoyed that Romney won't appear, like, on The View or... 
[00:03:30]  I love it.  Or the other show, Letterman, he won't do?  I love it.  Old school president.  What do you think?  We want Nixon on Lerona Martin's laughing again?  Suck it to me?  This is where I agree with Anthony.  Maybe you're right.  I think it's silly when Obama goes on The View and gets softball questions.  I hate that shit.  It kind of has that weird little flirting thing with the ladies.  And why would you go...  I completely agree with you, Adam.  To go on such a hostile environment like The View. 
[00:04:00]  Well, she shouldn't be...  Oh, she.  Oops, sorry.  Romney should not be scared to go into a hostile environment.  I'm not saying scared.  But I like your point that, you know, he has better things to do.  Better things to do.  Especially, you know, three weeks out from an election.  Better things to do.  And it just says...  It's like, fuck you.  Why would...  I want to give The View ratings...  Right.  ...and appear on their show when they do nothing but bash the shit out of him.  Without even any logic or reason to find it.  A Whoopi Goldberg, who immediately thinks he's just a big white racist guy. 
[00:04:30]  Wait a minute.  Elizabeth Hasselbeck hangs in there.  Oh, boy.  She's a big Romney lady.  The token conservative.  Yep.  That's great.  Yeah, it's just the dumb view.  It is the dumb view.  With those cackling hens.  So...  Master Romney.  Master Romney.  Yeah, I like that he's not...  It's that shit.  I like that he's not doing that show.  I like old school white president.  It's great. 
[00:05:00]  You think he's scared of them?  You think he's scared of the ladies?  I don't think he's scared of him.  I just think he thinks it's a Kobayashi Maru.  Why the fuck go there?  No win, my friend.  Here's the Hillary thing, taking responsibility.  Yeah, Hillary.  She's good, right?  No.  You like her long hair?  She's looking very gorgeous these days.  I think when you get into your 60s, that's not when you're supposed to start growing your hair long.  It's really strange to me.  Only crazy ladies grow their hair long.  Only crazy old ladies grow long hair.  I'm not saying shave it all off and start looking like a guy, but man, what's that about? 
[00:05:30]  You get in your 60s and then you decide to grow out your hair?  You ever see a skinny broad walking down the side of the road with long hair?  And then you're like, oh, let me take a look.  It looks like, if you remember the old commercial for Suspiria, that horror movie?  She's brushing her hair and they're playing like, roses are red, violets are blue.  It's real creepy.  And then she turns around and it's a skeleton face.  Do you feel very lonely that you're the only one that knows these references? 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  What year is that movie from?  Suspiria?  Yeah.  It's got to be the 80s.  I don't remember that.  No one knows.  Suspiria.  It's a Phil Collins song.  I bet you there's 10 people that just fucking were with you on that one.  I remember that.  Oh, maybe 77.  Suspiria?  I've never even heard this.  Turn the volume up.  It's kind of scary.  But look, he remembers.  She's combing her hair.  Her long hair.  The iris is a flower. 
[00:06:30]  Puts a flower in her hair and now slowly turns to the camera.  It's a skull!  You know how much that used to scare me?  It was a little faggot.  You were already 30 years old when this movie came out.  30.  Yeah, fuck it.  Is this a scary movie?  I don't remember at all.  This is old school scary.  Yeah, yeah.  It's fucking, you know.  You can hide.  It's one of those creepy fucking old movies.  What's she doing?  She's just back against a glass running with a dumb whore. 
[00:07:00]  No one rolls and backs in a glass like that when they're scared.  Look at how bad the...  Can you show the beginning again?  Just show...  Oh, that was pretty scary.  Yeah.  Suspiria.  At 77?  Yeah.  You said that.  Oh, okay.  It's just amazing what you remember it.  Oh, it is.  I know.  Even after playing this, I don't remember this.  Ah, that's scary right there.  Coming soon to a theater near you.  Yes.  Very good.  No one will be seated during the horrifying spinning woman through the glass segment. 
[00:07:30]  Why Suspiria?  Oh, old lady's growing the hair out.  Yeah, yeah.  So, you know, you go to take a look on the side of the road, and then you realize, like,  she's fucking 65, 70 years old.  Yeah, very good.  With the long hair.  You want to hear the Hillary clip?  Uh, sure.  Are you going to be all right with this?  I think so.  She's taking responsibility.  I take responsibility.  I'm in charge of the State Department.  60,000 plus people all over the world. 
[00:08:00]  275 posts.  The president and the vice president certainly wouldn't be knowledgeable about specific decisions  that are made by security professionals.  They're the ones who weigh all of the threats and the risks and the needs and make a considered  decision.  That's a strong statement.  Doesn't that sound like someone trying to cover for her boss?  Falling on the sword.  Falling on the sword, man.  She's the head.  But this is not the first time we've heard this type of thing, Anthony. 
[00:08:30]  Of course not.  But that doesn't mean that every time it's said that it's the right thing.  She's Ollie North.  Yeah.  She's Ollie North.  Right there.  Exactly.  Very good.  Good old Ollie North.  And you know what?  Perhaps the president, during some of his security meetings, should have been briefed on that.  Has the president ever briefed on the fact that it's September 11th, the anniversary of  the biggest terrorist attack on our country, and we have ambassadors and whatnot all over, 
[00:09:00]  perhaps stepping up security for everyone around the world on that day?  I'm sure we did.  Yeah.  But Hillary, so it's all my fault.  So I'm sure that any time it's addressed during the debate, that Obama is just going  to use the Hillary blanket to cover himself.  Well, he's going to have to say something, and I'm sure Romney's going to bring it up.  Yep.  So we'll see what happens tonight. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  This should be some good TV.  It's a town hall meeting, which I hate these fucking things.  With?  Candy Crowley.  Candy Crowley.  Bah, bah, bah.  Yeah.  Candy Crowley.  Candy Crowley should change her name.  She certainly doesn't look like a candy.  No.  She does look like a Crowley.  She looks like a Crowley, but not a candy.  Looks like she eats candy, but doesn't look like candy.  A lot of candy. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, is she a fucking...  Throughout your life, when you've met a woman named Candy, you don't see that, right?  No.  No.  It's usually a stripper in some dumb fucking club.  Hi, I'm Candy.  Oh, are you?  Would you like a little dance?  No, I'm just going to nurse my fucking $15 beer and go home.  Sorry.  Candy Crowley.  Who some say is very liberal, and it'll be two on one tonight at the debate.  Yeah, that's what they're saying.  She's not even supposed to really chime in during these town hall things. 
[00:10:30]  Didn't both sides say, look, no tough follow-up questions?  That hit the old AP yesterday.  Yeah, but now that she's saying, and CNN, and the debate board, whatever it is, they're  saying, no, no one agreed to that.  Yeah, good.  Both candidates should get tough questions.  Well, I don't think you're going to be seeing her dishing out too much shit to Obama.  The American people demand it.  There's such a liberal bias.  Well, no way that the people in the audience get to ask the questions.  Well, yeah.  And they can ask whatever the hell they want. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  It's not like they picked these people ahead of time and controlled exactly what they're  going to ask.  These are supposed to be non-committed voters that are the people asking the questions.  They're not one way or another.  How much do you hate the undecided voter?  I hate the undecided.  You know who the undecided voter is?  I was thinking about it yesterday.  They're the people that hold up the line because they don't know what the fuck they want  for lunch.  Oof.  It's those people that can't make a fucking decision.  Yeah.  Thus, then, why I'm playing that character on my Twitter. 
[00:11:30]  Oh.  Wow.  Or maybe not.  Oh.  Undecided voters stink.  How are you not decided at this point?  Yeah, we're a few weeks out here.  We're three weeks out.  Maybe you've had a couple of years to mull it over.  I love watching these polls because one of these guys says one dumb thing.  Like, oh.  Oh, I do like that.  Oh, I like that.  Okay.  Now I got to vote for him.  What else do you say?  Oh, no, no.  Oh, I can't vote for him.  I'm back down here now.  Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.  Nope, nope, nope, nope. 
[00:12:00]  I like him.  I like him.  Oh, what did he say?  Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope,  You know they're just twats sitting there.  Yeah.  I need more information.  You know it's those people.  We all have them in our lives.  How much more information could you possibly need?  Three weeks now.  I don't know.  I need more information.  Fucking assholes.  Fucking decide already.  We're three weeks away. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  You should know.  What could possibly change in three weeks?  Honestly, it really is nothing.  I fucking hate this.  As far as the policy of these two guys go, their records, nothing can change.  But the media glorifies them.  Yeah.  And you saw the debates with the vice presidential debate with the stupid graphs.  Those are the assholes.  Oh, now I like him.  I like him.  And then the line goes back, oh, no, I don't like him anymore.  You're talking about the line that goes while they're talking?  Yes, that's what I'm saying. 
[00:13:00]  I love that one.  Those are fucking idiots.  By the word, people are like.  By the word.  Oh, I like him.  I like him.  I hate him.  Right.  I like him.  I like him.  I like him.  I love this guy.  I like him.  I like him.  Oh, I hate him.  Do you want those idiots in your life?  Yeah, I know.  It's a rough one.  Why can't you, if you're an undecided voter and you're one of those graph people?  Yeah.  Why wouldn't you keep that line nice and smooth for most of the way?  Yeah.  With a couple little bumps here and there.  Not up and down. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  So they're doing that at Hofstra.  Town Hall, which is a little, I think that kind of favors Obama a little better.  Why?  I don't know.  Obama's always been kind of showy when it comes to addressing a crowd of people, civilians.  He's lost when he talks in front of people.  Well, now the thing is, without a teleprompter, he's very lost.  I was bamboozled by that.  I thought this guy was a great public speaker.  I was bamboozled by that.  Yeah, he does have trouble. 
[00:14:00]  Like Clinton, you know, he could get up there and just fucking talk to a crowd.  Great.  Reagan, the early years of Reagan certainly could do that.  Yes.  George Bush, not so much.  Who else?  Who else was good with a crowd?  Good with a crowd.  Well, you know, he's just kind of winging it.  Hitler.  Hitler was good with a crowd.  It's funny, but he really could whip a crowd into it, doing just about anything.  Holy cow.  I was watching Nickelodeon with my young son yesterday.  Oh, my young son in the car. 
[00:14:30]  And even the politics have hit Nickelodeon.  Really?  Yeah, where the two candidates are talking to the kids.  Like, they don't vote, you idiots.  Yeah, what are you trying to do?  And there's a clip of Obama just stumbling through some kind of question that a kid answered.  But it was pre-taped.  Really?  Even in a pre-taped piece, he looks like kind of like uncomfortable in his own skin.  If you could find it, that'd be great.  Yeah, he does bumble a bit.  He bumbles. 
[00:15:00]  When he's just talking.  And Romney looked stronger.  Romney's pretty good at that public speaking thing.  That debate was like, fuck.  Yeah.  Guy could handle himself in front of people.  Now we'll see, though, because I honestly think, even though Obama's got a stellar record  this past four years, I think people will be more hostile toward Romney than Obama in  a public forum like that.  Well, especially in the New York area.  Right.  Exactly.  This is sort of a democratic state. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I think you're going to see...  Sort of?  My God, man.  Yeah.  If you're a Republican, why bother voting in this state?  I don't think you're going to see people calling out Obama as much as they are going  to be calling out Romney.  Now, how about you call out Obama on his record instead of calling out Romney on what he might  or might not do?  Jiminy Cricket people.  I even took a peek at Chris Matthews.  For a guy that doesn't like politics, I certainly watch a lot of it.  And he was basically saying, hey. 
[00:16:00]  He said the numbers are going up a little bit, but are they going up enough?  He even questioned it.  I don't know.  We're going to have to get people out there to vote.  It's crazy over here.  Look at my hair.  It's a real good indicator on how well Obama's doing.  If my hair is really topsy-turvy, he's in trouble.  I was yelling.  He gets so upset.  But he had the big questions.  Like, some of the numbers definitely turning around a little bit, but are they turning  around enough and in time for the election? 
[00:16:30]  We will see.  That was his question.  Yes.  I think these debates are very telling.  And then I watched Reverend Al for probably 30 seconds because I didn't realize it was past  six o'clock.  That fucking guy.  Turned off that scowling asshole.  He is so annoying.  Mitt Romney.  He just says his name with contempt.  Mitt Romney.  What?  What?  See, this is the Nick thing.  Oh, boy.  I don't know if this is the clip, though. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, okay.  Yeah, kids pick the president.  That's something else.  This is more of that nonsense that these candidates are doing.  Kids pick the president.  But then they have the presidents, the presidents, they have Obama and Romney actually placating  to this nonsense.  Kids pick the president.  I don't know if this is the one I saw.  You have a vote.  You pick Barack Obama to be the next president, and America listens.  Congratulations to the next president of the United States, Barack Obama.  Hi, this is Barack Obama. 
[00:17:30]  And thanks for participating in Kids Pick the President.  See?  You do have the power.  No, you don't.  See, that's not the clip.  But whatever.  That was an old clip, I guess.  Oh, is that from the last election?  I guess the kids picked Obama, and he did win, and they said that.  You can't tell because Obama goes from gray hair to dark hair within a week.  Yes.  He has to suck more blood out of infants in order to get the youth out of them.  That's so weird, though.  His hair color changes.  Oh, I thought you were trying to get me to vote for him. 
[00:18:00]  I literally am undecided.  I am one of those people.  Oh, Jim.  I honestly am.  I need more information.  More information.  Oh, Jimmy.  Are you really undecided?  Dude, there's things about one that I like and things about the other.  Well, what did logic say that race should dictate?  What did logic say that we need?  I said it a while ago.  We need two presidents.  Co-presidents?  We need co-presidents.  You think? 
[00:18:30]  Yes.  It's hard.  Always fucking disagreeing.  Because no matter who you pick, you don't agree with everything they fucking put on the  table, right?  That's what makes it hard.  Now, do they share the White House?  They share the White House.  Ah.  Yes.  I said a while ago it should be twins, and one's got to be a Republican and one's got  to be a Democrat.  That would be cool.  What about the two-headed monster girl?  That would be nice.  A president with two heads?  Yeah.  You think?  Just scaring foreign dignitaries? 
[00:19:00]  Let's go with that for a second.  Do you think we'll ever get to that point in this country where we could have a two-headed  fucking monster as a president?  Well, let me tell you.  After the past four years, nothing would surprise me.  Amazing.  What about the...  Yeah.  I forgot their names.  Are they on still?  Yeah, I guess, but no one cares, because it's all about Honey Boo Boo.  Honey Boo Boo Cha.  Is that still doing well?  I haven't heard much about that show.  I can't imagine that's still doing well.  Honey Boo Boo's getting a big fucking raise for season two.  Yeah?  Yeah, Abby and Brittany, the two-headed monster twins. 
[00:19:30]  Maybe they had one season, and they're on hiatus.  Who?  The Abby-Brittany monster.  No, I think it's still happening.  Yeah?  Yeah, I think we're kind of in the middle to end of the season, but no one seemed to  watch.  They're in financial ruins, I know that, because their line of double hats just didn't  take off the way they thought it would.  They have, like, just double hats with a little curve in between them.  Double hats.  I thought I saw the finale...  Oh, no, I saw the Honey Boo Boo finale. 
[00:20:00]  What was the Honey Boo Boo finale?  They just kind of wrapped up and talked about what they had done the whole time.  Wasn't it the birth of the child?  And the birth of the child, them with the two thumbs.  Yeah.  Fucking bunch of crazy inbred white trash.  They're not happy with the South Park skit.  Hilarious.  That's the headline on the Honey Boo Boo thing.  Why?  They were pissed off.  They didn't think it was funny.  Well, let me play you something.  Did you see the South Park thing?  Slob.  I saw...  Can we get that clip?  Like, half of it.  The second half.  It was pretty funny with the alarm thing. 
[00:20:30]  I didn't see it.  Yeah, they were goofing on the alarm commercial.  I saw the headline, though.  A white man's trying to kill my child.  Yeah, well, I want to play that clip today.  Anyway, what else is going on?  There was something else.  It's the debate.  Oh, the Yankees.  Yeah.  Yes, the Yankees.  Tonight, they take it back to Detroit.  And, oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Not the must-must-win game, but this is really pretty fucking must-win.  You know. 
[00:21:00]  More importantly, did you read the sports page today?  Oh, boy.  What, in the post or the...  Well, A-Rod's slumping, as we all know.  Of course.  And now it's coming out when he sat the other night.  Yeah.  He spent most of the game flirting with two girls in the stands.  There's your guy.  Ah, that's great.  He don't give a fuck.  He doesn't care.  It's a big story.  Is it in your paper there?  Flirting?  Flirting, yes.  Wow.  Let me see.  They must have been very happy that he got benched. 
[00:21:30]  The girls were in bed.  The girls are like, yeah.  Oh, A-Rod, who threw the ball to those two chicks?  Yeah, but supposedly, they're saying that he was flirting with them the entire game.  Do you have the article?  I don't have it in the paper.  Yeah, pass this down.  It's in the post page.  Oh, they probably just are talking themselves up.  But no, he threw him a ball with a note that said, give me your number.  Oh, Jesus, did he?  A baseball.  He had a ball boy throw him a ball with a note on it that said, give me your number.  And they signed it. 
[00:22:00]  And they were going to give it to another.  They had already caught two.  And they were going to give it to another fan.  And someone said, you've got to read that.  So they read it.  And then one of the girls wrote, I guess, something on the ball and threw it back to the ball boy.  Oh, man.  Wait, are you believing Jimmy right now?  Yeah.  Oh, now I'm not.  I'm saying no.  Look at his face now.  He blew the smirk.  Now he's smiling.  That would be so fucking wrong to do. 
[00:22:30]  That would be disgusting.  Oh, my God.  You almost bought it, though, Ann.  I did.  Almost buy it.  No, but just read it, too, they say.  Sam, what do you got on that?  I don't feel like reading right now.  Hits on gals at ALCS game.  I see that.  Alex was holding a pen and wrote a note on a ball.  What the hell is Alex?  A-Rod.  Oh.  Which was thrown at the women by a ball boy.  He did.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Jimmy was telling the truth.  He's not telling the truth. 
[00:23:00]  He's working with Jimmy.  Oh, man.  What?  The girls had already caught two balls, seemed bemused at first, and tried to hand the ball  to another fan.  But other fans noticed the note on it and yelled at them to read it.  Dude, it says it right there.  Alex was holding a pen.  Now, do you think if I was working with this dummy, he would improv the word bemused?  That's true.  Wait, is this true?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what he did.  Then note asked them to write their phone numbers on the ball and throw it back.  What a cunt.  Isn't he a cunt? 
[00:23:30]  No, he is a cunt.  He's an absolute cunt.  He's a...  Ugh.  What a great fucking move to be able to pull your baseball player.  Yeah, but after...  When you're two for 13, you're going to hit on girls in the front row and say, what a fucking twat.  Yeah, how about you hit something else like the baseball?  Fucking A.  Here.  High five.  Yeah.  You don't give a shit.  Jesus.  You don't give a shit.  God.  He's a cocksucker.  You fans should fucking run him out of town, man.  Make the remaining years miserable for this guy. 
[00:24:00]  All those open seats behind the dugout because the fucking stupid team won the charts $1,500.  That's embarrassing looking for this guy.  You know, you got the soul of the team there, Jeter, out with the ankle thing, and this guy  is flirting with women in the stands.  What a loser.  They said he stopped flirting when Jeter went out.  They said that's when it stopped.  What?  When Jeter went out.  Was it that game, though?  I guess so.  Jeter went out in the 12th inning.  Oh, okay.  Well, that's when he stopped.  Well, no, what?  In the 9th inning or something?  8th or 9th inning?  So it was the whole game. 
[00:24:30]  If I was the ball boy, I'd have thrown it to some fat guy in the stand.  He's hitting on a big fat man.  The girls are pretty good looking.  What else?  Does the article say anything else, Sam?  No, just that he did it after being replaced in the bottom of the 9th inning of Game 1 on Saturday.  Oh, so it was late in the game.  But, man, that's a hell of a move.  What a prick. 
[00:25:00]  Wait, that was the game where, what's his name, hit the homer?  Alvarez?  How about your fucking, how about you maybe practice your batting?  Yeah.  During every free moment.  Go to Atlanta and see what Chief Nakahoma would do.  Chief Nakahoma.  I don't like that.  It makes me physically ill.  That and Chief Wahoo in Cleveland.  I love that's what we think of Indians these days.  And it's just.  It's what it is, right?  It's a joke, by the way, you idiots.  It says he's still dating Tori Wilson. 
[00:25:30]  Is he?  He's got to be the worst boyfriend on the fucking planet.  Be single, idiot.  Yeah.  If that's what you want to be, be single.  Fuck.  He's the worst.  Yeah.  He's the worst clutch hitter, too.  I bet, like, whenever he's trying to get a girl pregnant, his dick won't work.  Like, he could probably fuck all the time, but if she's like, oh, knock me up, then his dick just goes soft because the pressure's on.  Like, he always, always flops when the fucking pressure's on.  Does he actually have fans? 
[00:26:00]  He does.  He's a great player, obviously, one of the best home run hitters ever and all that, blah, blah, blah.  But does he actually have fans?  Like, when you mentioned Jeter, people were like, oh, fucking Jeter, I love the guy.  But you never come across living in New York people that actually like A-Rod.  No one thinks he's going to be hard.  It's like they tolerate him, and if he's on a good hitting streak, they obviously like him because he's on your team.  But it doesn't seem like he has actual fans.  No, he's not beloved, much like Jeter and some of the Yankees of yesteryear. 
[00:26:30]  Again, he doesn't have any heart.  He's not a winner.  He's not a guy that can, like, lead the team.  And, like, for that kind of money, people just hate him for that.  People like Andy Pettit in New York more than A-Rod.  People love Rivera.  People love Jeter.  Those are the names you're mentioning where you know they have fans.  Yeah.  Where people are like, fuck, that's my guy.  Sure.  That's my fucking guy.  Pettit, that's my fucking guy.  You never hear it about A-Rod.  Never.  Clemens has fans.  Not even in New York, but also in Boston.  Like, Roger Clemens had a lot of people who loved what he did.  Yeah. 
[00:27:00]  A-Rod, I can't think of any group that really likes him.  Mm-hmm.  No.  No.  Where's he going to take an A-Rod jersey?  Is he going to start tonight?  Uh-oh.  A-Rod?  Probably.  That's too bad.  Yeah.  Your Yankees are so fucked, huh?  It really is.  It's just grim.  It's grim.  And you don't like football, so you're done for a while.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You certainly don't like basketball.  Yeah.  We all know that.  So what are you going to do?  Just fly helicopters?  Just fucking, yeah.  Fly fucking helicopters.  You want to see helicopters? 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, that's my whole thing now.  I'm just flying helicopters around my neighborhood.  I loved how you scrubbed your mission yesterday.  I had to scrub the mission due to weather.  That was a very dramatic tweet yesterday.  Dude, I was so fucking close to complete autonomous flight.  I was right there.  I had all the equipment set up.  It was all set up on my fucking table out back, ready to just press a single button and  have this thing take off and mosey around.  By itself?  All by its lonesome.  Wow.  You programmed what you wanted to do?  Programming everything you wanted to do before it even leaves the ground. 
[00:28:00]  So what does that mean?  Like, I'm going to program it to go 500 feet in the air?  I go, yeah, I go take it up 500 feet, and then I'll be like, I'll just go to the map  because it uses Google Maps as your guide, and then I'll just be like, I'm going to set  a waypoint for, let's just pick something.  Maybe the middle school by the expressway.  Of course.  I want it to hover over the fucking field hockey game.  Of course.  It's so weird how that was a random choice.  It's a random choice. 
[00:28:30]  And then while it's doing that, I pick up the other remote controller and control the  camera.  So I don't have to worry about flying the thing around, and now I can zoom in anywhere  I want.  I could direct the camera and use the view.  It's a real-time camera view also.  Can you, when you say you're going to hover over the middle school, can you set how long  it hovers?  Oh, yeah.  And then, wow, really?  And you could change everything.  Yeah, I could have it.  That's pretty cool.  Go to any waypoint and hang out there at a predetermined time. 
[00:29:00]  Right.  So I could say stay there for five minutes.  Right.  And then boogie on back home.  By itself.  All by itself.  That's so fucked up.  And each waypoint has its own altitude, so you could have it go from 60 feet up to 500  feet between waypoints and then come back home.  But, yeah, all my equipment set up, I'm looking at a picture, I'm ready to go.  Is all that top-of-the-line stuff?  Yes.  You can't get much higher? 
[00:29:30]  No.  In this day and age, consumer brand stuff, you know, I'm sure if you sat there with a  soldering iron and an electronic engineering degree, perhaps you can make something better.  But as far as consumer availability?  That's pretty impressive, huh?  This shit is going to be so illegal.  I can't imagine.  There's also another thing on this, which the ground control program, it's called.  Where you can drop bombs?  You can drop things.  You can do anything. 
[00:30:00]  You can control a servo.  So let's say I want the copter to go from my house to a waypoint one, wherever I have  that be.  And then once it gets there, it'll know to move a servo that's hooked up to the thing,  which could be a little lever.  It could be a hook.  It could be something that just drops something.  Wow.  And then it could just turn around and go back home.  Well, you could pick up stuff that way.  I mean, within minimal weight, I'm sure, but eventually that one could lift.  Even loaded with everything that's loaded on there now, I could put an additional six 
[00:30:30]  pounds on it.  So, you know, I was thinking how hilarious it would be to just drop a bag full of knives  into a prison yard during like their workout time.  Just a giant bag of knives.  Well, it's only six pounds, though.  You just said.  Yeah.  You'd get a few knives.  You'd get a few fucking, like, shanks.  I can't believe that hasn't happened yet.  How hilarious would it be?  A bunch of prisoners just running for it and stabbing each other?  To make drug deals.  Drug deals?  How about that?  You want to drop fucking drugs? 
[00:31:00]  Drop a bag of drugs?  Well, you go in at night.  Yeah.  You go in at night, and you drop a pistol by the edge of the fence.  There you go.  Something like that.  In the middle of the night.  And then the one guy who knows about it the next morning goes out, and he knows the pistol's  there.  And you're not even near the thing.  So, you know, the person controlling it, it's not like you have to be close.  They're going to look out and find you somewhere.  That sucks.  They're going to get rid of all that.  Oh, I know.  It's obvious.  It's just too dangerous for regular people to own.  Thank God Mayor Bloomberg's distracted by sodas, by the way. 
[00:31:30]  Yes.  I'm obsessed with that soda band, because it's the dumbest thing ever.  And this is a good example, and I don't want to take your hobby away from you, but obviously  this looks like it has potential to be way worse than a dumb soda thing.  Used improperly, and irresponsibly, and illegally, this could absolutely be a problem.  Like what, the landing at the height of planes coming in, or almost crash landing on the LIE?  All right, look, I may have gotten into a problem last week, but now with the addition 
[00:32:00]  of the equipment I put on yesterday, it would be very difficult.  I have video monitoring, so I could see exactly what the camera sees as it's flying, GPS location  now, and the map, and the waypoints, which tell it where to go.  So more equipment came?  Yeah.  Is it working?  Yep.  It worked fucking beautifully yesterday.  I was very happy, and then I was just ready to take off, and I saw some raindrops starting  to fall, and I'm like, ah, got all this electronic shit out onto my table, and the copter itself. 
[00:32:30]  Is it a mystery where you're taking your first flight?  I'm going to keep it close, but yes, it is top secret.  Top secret.  Top secret mission.  I can't be just telling people where this is.  Are you putting the helicopter in the air so we can all enjoy the fall foliage?  Fall foliage.  I'm looking very forward to seeing some fall foliage with it.  Imagine that he spent all his money just for fall foliage.  Yeah.  That's what I do.  Because he's a colors enthusiast.  Yes. 
[00:33:00]  He wants to see how the colors are doing.  There's now, two, three, four, five, I think there's about six antennas on the thing now.  It's just a big antenna machine.  That's pretty damn cool, man.  It is pretty fucking cool.  You've got to bring that shit to the city.  I, oh, I so want to fucking take this thing in the city.  It's too heavy.  Fly it around.  Why don't the lighter models?  It's too, if it falls, you're going to kill somebody.  Well.  Then again, I think the NYPD has got to be pretty.  You think they'd have a problem?  I think they're pretty aware of these things.  Just fucking shooting in the air at it?  I think they're pretty aware.  It would be a danger if, you know, it did fall out of the sky on someone's head. 
[00:33:30]  We've got a traffic copter.  But, yeah, that could be.  You know, the protected airspace of New York City could be a problem.  I would like to buzz it around Central Park at low altitude.  That would be cool.  Especially in the summer when the girls are out there.  Beautiful girls.  Beautiful girls.  Get some fucking, uh, some bikini ass shots.  Yeah.  You think that's what Dan's going to do?  The foliage?  He's coming out with a book called Foliage from Afar.  Which is going to be screen cap videos with a little helicopter rotor on the top.  Yeah.  Have you picked your song for the fall foliage video? 
[00:34:00]  I don't know.  I'm thinking something really relaxing and mellow.  I think Oasis.  A little Oasis?  I know you're not a huge fan, but I think Oasis could do the trick for that one.  I was going to go a little, uh, maybe Crosby stills a gnat.  Yeah.  Without Young.  Please do that.  Yeah, I'm going to do the fall foliage video.  You have to do a fall foliage video.  Fall foliage.  Please do that.  Yes.  When does it hit peak around here?  Another couple weeks?  Couple weeks, yeah.  It takes forever around here.  I remember when I was living in Western New York, like, the colors start in, like, fucking September, I think.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:34:30]  They're way past peak, way up there, I would believe.  I've already seen pictures of people, uh, that have, uh, gone upstate and up to New England and shit.  That's all.  It's all done up there.  I kind of liked it.  Yeah?  Yeah, I kind of like doing that shit.  It's a long-ass drive for some leaves.  Getting into nature a little bit, do some hiking.  Yeah?  Yeah, I liked all that crap.  Hmm.  Hmm.  I don't know.  I'm, uh, I'm kind of like, I don't like driving unless I'm going somewhere, you know?  I love looking at the fall foliage. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah?  No!  No!  I like, uh, I like checking out a few streams, maybe a little waterfall.  Do you like the fall foliage?  Yeah, I kind of do.  I just like getting the fuck away from people.  That'll do it.  Get out in the woods.  Yes.  In the woods ends.  Yes.  All right, well, we got, uh, Bubba the Love Sponge getting sued for $100 million.  Wow.  Ah!  Well, Gawker's $100 million.  Is Bubba in that?  Yeah.  Wow.  Gawker, too, is getting...  Oh, that's the main one. 
[00:35:30]  Is it?  Yeah.  He's, no, I think he's suing, uh, I think Hulk Hogan is suing, um, Bubba and Gawker for $100 million.  Sue everyone, brother, for punitive damages you're giving me.  Well, the thing...  Bubba's...  Bubba has wanted a relationship over the years.  He's just, he's just dirty, man.  Bubba is just a fuck, one of those creepy, dirty, like everything he's involved in is shady.  Cowhead's probably having a ball with this down there.  He's just dirty, the guy, you know, I, I don't know, I've just heard and seen things over the years, and this guy, I don't know. 
[00:36:00]  I mean, why, you know, you're supposedly so close to Hulk Hogan, and then you secretly tape him having sex with your wife.  That's fucked up.  Well, you know what?  And then he goes into his office, because he obviously wanted to watch it live.  And Hulk can't file criminal charges, because the statute of limitations is passed.  But how does that count if you don't know it at the time?  Yeah, right?  Is that fair?  Yeah.  There'll be some workarounds.  That's not fair that you can't prosecute criminally for that.  How long ago was that?  Six years ago.  Six years ago.  That was six years ago? 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Here's the announcement from the courthouse.  Who is that?  It's his wife.  That's his wife.  That's the one Hulk was fucking?  Yeah.  How did Bubba get that?  Holy shit.  She's fucking smoking.  Big fucking fake tits, but she's sexy.  Oh, man.  Heather, she's a pretty face.  The Hulkster was banging that in that fucking room.  Yeah, he was.  I'd love to have sex with her.  Did she dump Clem?  Bubba Clem?  Yeah, I guess they're now like... 
[00:37:00]  Divorced.  Divorced.  Estranged.  I like seeing estranged.  And so, supposedly, he's not allowed to talk too much, because that's part of the settlement  with her.  Oh, boy.  You know, he's claiming he's a victim.  Bubba Love Sponge is claiming he's a victim, but he pushed record on the fucking tape, basically.  He did, huh?  On his best friend.  Well, who else did?  He knew.  He definitely knew.  Who else did?  He shows up in the video going, look what we got now.  We could retire off this if we wanted to.  But then I've heard that Hulk knew about the tape. 
[00:37:30]  Huh?  Then I've heard Hulk knew about the tape.  Yeah?  For years.  And that a lot of staffers had seen it, and that they were looking at somebody who used  to work here.  I don't know if that's true or not.  That was just a rumor I heard.  But I heard that people knew about this, which was not surprising, or that Hulk knew about  it.  Well, we'll see what comes out.  But here's the announcement from the courthouse.  Hulk Hogan filed two lawsuits today in Tampa, Florida.  Hulk Hogan.  Why are they using his real name?  I don't know.  Why are they...  His name isn't Hulk Hogan.  Isn't this legal wrangling? 
[00:38:00]  It should be a...  Terrible.  Terri?  That's not even his real name.  That's the name that he used since he was in high school.  Oh?  What's his real name?  Chip Chips.  I couldn't think of a believable name.  Chip Chips.  Let me tell you something.  What are you, taping like I need to be taped because I'm broken or something?  Hulkamaniac, sis.  What am I turning green or something? 
[00:38:30]  Sis.  You're ripping off Kenan from SNL.  Yeah, really.  Oh, no.  Is he doing a bit like that?  Yes, he is.  That's his catchphrase.  Oh, no.  We all know.  Oh, Clem.  Sounds like clam.  Tits.  Tits.  It's good.  Got a big fake tits.  Hulk Hulkerson.  Yeah, Hulk Hulkerson.  Hulk Hulkerson.  What's that little fat kid looking at me?  She's sexy there, man. 
[00:39:00]  I am a real American.  The first lawsuit was filed in the Florida State Court.  It was filed against Heather Clem and her ex-husband, Todd Allen Clem, also known as Bubba the Love Sponge.  The allegations in that lawsuit state that approximately six years ago, the Clems secretly videotaped Mr. Hogan having private, consensual, intimate relations in a private bedroom. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, boy.  Mr. Hogan had no knowledge that he was being videotaped.  He did not consent to the taping because he didn't know about it, and he would never have permitted it.  Never.  Is Bubba talking about this on his radio show, E-Rock?  No.  He hasn't said a word.  Wow.  He's leaving me, brother.  Why wouldn't he say a word?  How are you not talking about this on your radio show?  Yeah, it's got to fucking... 
[00:40:00]  It's got to kill him.  I can't.  I can't get into it.  It's a legal issue.  Whoa.  Damn, Bubba.  Come on.  How do you not talk about this?  Gee, man, man.  I mean, people are throwing you under the bus.  Say something.  Say something.  You keep saying you're a victim.  Say something.  He's freaking out.  The Hulk is there just banging that.  And Hulk wants fucking ownership of the tape.  I want the tape, brother.  The second lawsuit filed today was filed in the United States District Court for the Middle 
[00:40:30]  District of Florida.  It was filed against Gawker Media and its related entities and individuals.  It alleges that the defendants posted excerpts of the videotape at their website, Gawker.com, for the purpose of obtaining financial profit at the expense of Mr. Hogan and in violation of his rights of privacy.  After Gawker was notified by Mr. Hogan's legal counsel that he had been secretly videotaped, that he had never consented to any aspect of that video, and after he and his legal counsel demanded repeatedly that Gawker remove that video from its website, Gawker refused to do so. 
[00:41:00]  And it continued to post that video.  The acts of Gawker Media are illegal, outrageous, and exceed the bounds of human decency. 
[00:41:30]  The lawsuit against Gawker seeks damages in the amount of $100 million.  Whoa.  I love how we live in a world where there's a Hulk Hogan suing a Bubba the Love Sponge and Gawker.  Yeah, but he doesn't say Gawker.  He says Gawker.  Gawker.  I don't know how you say it.  Gawker.  Gawker.  I really hope Hulk wins his lawsuit.  He's going to win.  And I tell you, that Gawker, the arrogance of those motherfuckers to not take that down when his legal team said that was taped. 
[00:42:00]  Like, that's the world we live in.  This was made against...  He said, we're just fucking, and they just feel like they have the right to post that.  What the fuck are they thinking?  How do you post somebody privately fucking and think you're not going to get sued?  Yep.  I literally hope he wins.  Hulk will win.  And I hope it ruins them.  Because that's the culture we live in.  The fucking, the nosy, shitty country we live in.  Look, I wanted to see it too.  But this guy just fucked a woman in private, was taped. 
[00:42:30]  They know he was taped without his knowledge, and they still...  Like, if they had just panicked and taken it down, like we didn't realize that he had no knowledge of this,  A, he might not have sued them if they took it down immediately.  Well, they would at least have a case too.  They'd at least have a case.  Oh, look, we did the right thing when we found out.  But nope, arrogant fucks.  They're fucked.  Nope, arrogant.  Keep it up.  We're entitled to see this.  We're entitled.  Fuck his privacy.  They're fucked.  Yeah.  I hope he wins every lawsuit. 
[00:43:00]  I hope he wins.  There's still a lot of people who think Hogan's working.  Oh, wow.  You don't...  This is a work?  Absolutely not.  A lot of people think it.  I mean, well, when you're, you know, your whole job is crying wolf.  Yeah.  People do think, but occasionally real things happen to Hulk, the Hulkster.  What do you think, Sam?  You interviewed Hulk Hogan.  The Hulkster.  I knew I was a Hulkamaniac.  You made him cry.  He knew that I bleed red and yellow, and he told me he was not in on it.  Look, I'll tell you why it's not a work.  Because it's now a fucking lawsuit.  Right. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Although the...  Imagine if Hulk Hogan does...  No.  He would be in deep shit for his fake lawsuit.  Hulk Hogan had filed a lawsuit.  Hulk Hogan filed a lawsuit.  Oh, is that what people are going with?  That's what the lawyer just said.  But you could check it.  You could absolutely check to see if this was really filed, though.  Yeah, they would say that, though.  And I'm sure someone has filed, you know, has checked to see, to make sure this is a real lawsuit.  Here comes Bubba's lawyer.  And I'm going to fight this way.  Yeah!  You see the fucking... 
[00:44:00]  The courtroom door opens up and Vince comes in.  The Hulk is back.  Jesus Christ.  I'll read a habeas corpus!  Yeah.  I like that Vince CM Punk clip.  Yeah?  That's pretty good.  What's that?  You don't watch wrestling.  I saw...  Somebody sent me a clip because it was Vince just going crazy and talking about firing him.  And CM Punk's pretty good. 
[00:44:30]  He's pretty good with, like, a mic and just getting in Vince's face and shit.  You see him slap him?  Yeah, and then he slapped Vince in the face.  Vince put on that exasperated face that he puts on.  Oh, he's on the ground like, I can't believe he did that.  God damn it, punk!  It's so fucking funny.  Vince.  Vince is getting up there, though, man.  He really shouldn't be thrown around the ring.  The problem is that I think he panicked because the ratings have been low. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  He's always like, I gotta do it myself!  Gotta get out there!  Oh, you know that's what happens.  That's why he's in a suit, because he had no intention of wrestling, but he's like,  fuck!  Yeah.  I gotta get out there again!  Well, then he came back, and then he worked a match later in the night.  Jesus Christ.  In his cutoff...  What's his name back from his heart attack?  Who?  I forget his name.  Oh, Jerry the King Lawler?  Yeah, Jerry.  No, he's out.  Really?  Yeah, it's doing...  Vince must be pissed.  JR and JBL.  Get your ass back to work!  Let's face it, there was a shot against me, right? 
[00:45:30]  What are we looking at?  Do we have to watch this whole thing?  CM Punk is just...  Without mentioning my name, it was a shot at me because I won't step in the ring with  John Cena at Hell in the Cell.  He doesn't say Robert Blake now.  He does.  I like how they mention the events during the...  He's angry and yelling at Vince.  And you put in charge of this very show, who left the decision...  And Hell in the Cell on November, but...  They get the dates in there and everything.  If I face Johnson, you know Hell in the Cell or not.  God knows I've given him shot after shot after shot in the last shot in his hometown of Boston. 
[00:46:00]  He couldn't get the job done, and I walked out the WWE champion.  Even when they're angry, they don't have to get applause breaks.  Oh, yeah.  And yet, listen to him.  They boo.  They boo.  He's a great deal.  He's a good deal.  He's got a manager.  That's how you know he's a bad guy.  Yeah, bad guys have managers, right?  Oh, he became a heel?  Oh, yeah.  He went super heel.  How dumb are the fans to buy it, or are they just playing along?  I mean, it's, you know...  Oh, they hate him.  They don't just buy it. 
[00:46:30]  We like you, boo.  I'm gonna wrestle you down.  We don't like you anymore.  Fucking morons.  Although, I will say...  When we were tweeting back and forth for the Chicago appearance, I started getting...  Because my app mention was on it, so I started getting the replies to his tweets  from fans.  Oh.  And he really does get, like, hundreds and thousands of tweets from people that were  like, why would you do that to The Rock?  Oh, no.  Why would you knock him down? 
[00:47:00]  I hate you.  It's still real to me.  You know?  Damn it.  It's still real to me.  See, I don't have that.  We'll text once in a while, but I don't have that.  Oh, you mean you have adult conversations with him?  Yeah.  You know what these guys do to their bodies?  Asshole.  What a dick.  That fat little fuck.  It was so...  It was weird, because I don't even watch WrestleMania, and I'm like, why is fucking Vince in the  middle of the ring announcing that my new CD is now available for pre-order on iTunes?  Yay!  And we got copies. 
[00:47:30]  Nice one.  It doesn't come out until the 11th of December.  It's called No Baby for You.  Yes.  Time for the holiday.  From Jim Norton.  Yeah, I taped it the same time I taped my last CD.  I did, like, 90 minutes over the weekend, and I made two completely different CDs.  Oh.  So the material's a few years old, but it's never been released as a CD before, so...  Nice.  I'm very happy with this one.  Very exciting, Jimmy.  And I have to horror one more thing.  A Sunday show has been added in the greatest market in the country for us, Philadelphia.  Philaire.  At the Helium.  What's going on? 
[00:48:00]  What's going on down there?  That's not how they talk, though.  It is.  Two Thursdays, Friday, Saturday.  Water.  Water.  You want to have a lolly?  Have a lolly?  Start with water.  Water.  Crayon.  Crayon.  Wait, now I can't do it.  Crayon.  Water.  Water.  Crown.  Crown.  What's all this?  It's a crown.  It's a lolly.  It's a crown.  A crown.  No, it's a taffy.  God, you're confusing everything now.  Let me get a taffy.  A crayon is a crown.  A lollipop is a taffy.  A taffy.  And they say water. 
[00:48:30]  Water.  Wait, I can't do it now.  Water.  So what you have to do is order tickets for Sunday the 28th.  There you go.  Water.  One show has been added on this Sunday, too.  That's awesome, Jimmy.  It's so nice to have a good market like Philly.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Philly.  Yeah.  Why don't we go to the break with that clip?  Oh, yeah.  It's still real to me.  Oh, I love that dummy.  And I think we should do Jocktober next.  Yeah.  I'm feeling like we're ready.  Yeah.  I think we're ready today.  Sure.  And Vic Henley's coming in.  Very funny guy.  He, uh... 
[00:49:00]  I know the guests.  Thank God.  He was in the Eagles.  Not for the guests.  Let's just hang out and talk.  Henry Winkler.  Right.  He was great.  Yeah.  I want to see his play.  We're going to go see his play.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  We're going to go see his play.  Hey, my play.  And everything fancy.  Yeah.  Why don't we do that, then?  I got blow by those.  I just want to thank each and every one of y'all for all you've done to your bodies. 
[00:49:30]  It's still real to me, damn it.  I'll be...  Thank you.  Thank you, man.  Thank y'all, guys.  Y'all were awesome.  Thank you so much, Mr. Funk, for saying what needed to be said.  I don't want to see another one of these.  Well, thanks.  This is next time.  The Open Entry Show. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, words.  I just wanted to hear the fucking...  It's hard to talk like this.  I get the strap.  What?  I know.  E-Rock came in.  He goes, do you guys want a rejoiner?  And I was like, if he plays rejoiner, I'm going to go in there and gobble his fingers up like little snacks.  What's wrong with a good rejoiner every once in a while? 
[00:50:30]  I've never heard a good rejoiner.  Oh, wow.  Broncos were down 24-zip at halftime.  That's about where...  Amazing.  Amazing.  Where I said to myself, time to go to sleep.  And then you wake up in the morning.  It's one of those things where you wake up in the morning and go, what the fuck happened?  Yeah.  They lost.  Yes, they did.  The charges, I mean, after being up 24-zip.  Whoops.  Fucking Broncos, 35 charges, 24.  Wow.  35 unanswered points in the second half.  Wow.  They were under the impression that they had it in a bag when they did not have it in said bag. 
[00:51:00]  Did you hear the Rolling Stones' new song?  No.  Did I dream this?  Yes.  No, the new Stones' song is decent.  Wait, did I dream this?  The new Stones' song?  No.  There's one out, right?  Yeah, it's just hilarious when you're not sure.  For a second, I swear, I went, oh my God, was that a dream or do the Rolling Stones really have a song out?  They do, right?  Yeah, it's a new one.  It's called We're Up High, But Still Down to Earth. 
[00:51:30]  Nice.  It's all about getting older.  I don't mind this dumb song by the Rolling Stones.  It goes like, we're up high, but still down to earth.  Earth.  Can we listen to the new Stones' song?  You don't like it?  No.  We don't have it, right?  Because I dreamt it.  I did.  I dreamt it, right?  Yeah, probably.  Did you dream it?  Until I hear it, I'm going to assume I dreamt it. 
[00:52:00]  Does that happen to you ever?  No, you dreamt.  Wait, does that happen to you ever?  No, I'm usually pretty good on knowing if I was dreaming something.  Oh my God.  Right afterwards.  Yeah.  He wakes up and he sees whatever the color of the president is, and he knows if he was awake or sleeping.  Nightmare.  I said dreams, not nightmares, yes.  All right, here it is.  I didn't dream.  Yeah, we're up high, but still down to earth.  This is good.  I actually don't mind this. 
[00:52:30]  It sounds like three Stones songs all together.  It was.  Now I can put it all together now.  Because the first line is, I had a dream last night.  See what happens sometimes?  This is called Gurr?  Gurr, this is called?  I don't know.  Is that the working title?  That's the album.  This is good.  I don't mind this.  Yeah, go back again.  It sounds like...  All right, what does the beginning sound like?  It sounds like...  Brown Sugar? 
[00:53:00]  No.  A little brown sugar in the beginning?  Start again.  The song is called Doom and Gloom.  The album is a greatest hits album called Gurr.  Oh, really?  It's one of those dumb things?  Featuring 50 songs, including Doom and Gloom.  I fucking hate when your favorite band does the greatest hits thing, and then they throw  those two new songs on at the end of the disc.  Is this new?  And then a few years go by, and guess what?  You never play those two fucking tracks.  No, you just want the greatest hits.  I fucking hate when they...  That's lazy.  You're the Rolling Stones.  You should be able to still put out a fucking album.  Yeah.  This is new. 
[00:53:30]  And how many greatest hits have they put out over the years?  A lot.  Honky Tonk Woman and A Little Brown Sugar.  That's both of them put together at the beginning of this.  Really?  Let's listen.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like it. 
[00:54:00]  Settling in the dirt.  See the kind of hurt.  When I'm not here.  It's too many things.  Dude.  Dang.  All the darkness. 
[00:54:30]  Every mile in.  Through the light.  Yes.  Good.  Your face.  I see.  Baby, take a chance.  Baby, won't you dance?  May.  Dude, they're 70.  70.  70.  Just go to show you don't get what to pay for.  Well, I do the rich in your world.  I've got to pour up the beer from the cap. 
[00:55:00]  Can't lock all the doors.  You hear the funky noise.  That's the timing of the screams.  Screams.  Can't work.  Settling in the dirt.  Settling in the dirt.  Settling in the dirt.  I like this.  The windows dry.  This also sounds like something else.  Settling in the dirt.  Through the night. 
[00:55:30]  Your face I see.  Baby, take a chance.  Baby, won't you dance for me?  May.  May.  May.  May.  Yeah.  You feelin' what you face to me?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Say it out.  I like this.  Keep going?  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm trying to see for a while, but there's nothing in the song. 
[00:56:00]  There's kids all picking at the garbage dump.  I'm running out of water, so I better prime the pond.  I'm trying to stay sober, but I end up drunk.  We're eating dirt, living on the side of the road.  There's some people thought. 
[00:56:30]  Gonna make your hair explode.  Say it can't hurt.  It's like that Wild Wild West song.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I love that.  It sounds like a lot of different songs.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It does.  It's darkness in my ring.  I see you at night.  Your face is awesome. 
[00:57:00]  Baby, come on.  Baby, won't you dance with me?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's really good, though.  Baby, won't you dance with me?  I'm feeling kind of hurt.  Baby, won't you dance with me?  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  Dance with me.  It's like retirement home men age. 
[00:57:30]  Rocking.  And he still likes to dance.  He says it to a woman.  She has an epilepsy fist.  An epilepsy fist.  I like that.  That's great.  I'm pleasantly surprised.  Cool, right?  It's not embarrassing.  Oh, you don't really like it?  It's not really, you know, my cup of tea.  But usually when a band of that age puts out an album or a band that's been around that long, 
[00:58:00]  it's usually embarrassing, you know, like fucking, we're back.  Are you a big Stones fan, though?  Not really?  Not really.  There's a few songs that are pretty goddamn cool.  In the 70s?  She would never say where she came from.  Like that shit I like.  Yeah.  I like that song.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  There's a few that are pretty good.  But not on the whole there, not really.  What about Dead Flowers?  No.  No.  Love the Dead Flowers. 
[00:58:30]  No.  That ain't one of them.  No.  Midnight Rambler?  Yeah, that's a pretty good one.  Paint It Black.  Yeah, of course.  Paint It Black.  What about Sympathy?  Sympathy is pretty good.  Satisfaction?  Nah.  It's been played a lot.  Yeah.  Mother's Little Helper?  Yeah, I like Mother's Little Helper.  Brown Sugar?  No, not a big Brown Sugar fan.  No.  You don't like the concept of that song.  Yeah, I know.  Jesus.  It's frightening.  Tears go by?  Yeah, every time I...  Oh.  What about She's a Rainbow? 
[00:59:00]  I like that one, too.  Yeah, yeah, that's a good one.  Yeah.  So basically, you like every Stones song that's been mentioned so far.  Yeah, Jesus.  I guess I'm a huge Stones fan.  I just didn't realize.  I just don't like the ones that are played all the time.  What about...  You can't hold it.  No, I'm not a big fan of that one.  Why?  When it kicks in?  Come on.  You can't always get what you want.  No?  No.  Fuck.  Really?  What about anything from Tattoo You? 
[00:59:30]  Tattoo You?  That was a very simple album.  Tattoo?  But Waiting on a Friend's kind of cool.  No.  I hate that fucking song.  Really?  I hated the video.  Why?  They were in the village here in New York.  They were just sitting on a stoop.  Yeah, they were just regular guys.  I'm just waiting on a friend.  And he's like waiting on a friend.  You just ruined the song for me.  That stinks.  Is that how he's saying it for real?  Yeah, yeah.  Can I hear Waiting on a Friend?  I don't think he's saying it like that.  I'm not waiting.  I'm not waiting.  I'm waiting.  I'm waiting.  I'm waiting.  Come on. 
[01:00:00]  Why do you do this to me?  It's terrible.  You take away all that's precious to me.  I like this when it came out.  Walking around with some fucking fruit in the village.  Not waiting on a lady.  No.  He's waiting on a fucking little fist.  Yeah.  That's his friend.  Yeah.  I hated it from this part on.  Really?  I hate that.  Look at what he's wearing. 
[01:00:30]  Well, it's early 80s.  His dumb hat.  He's tapping his finger, waiting on a friend.  This came out like 81, 82.  82 maybe?  It ain't the latest thing.  Someone lives there.  Like, hey.  You ever see that video?  And then the dog, why?  I think a lot of Stones fans find that place 
[01:01:00]  and get their picture taken in front of the doorway.  How old was this fucking song?  Look how everyone is like,  holy fuck, Keith Richards walking down the street.  Yeah, what the fuck?  That was before they could control the crowd.  No, they didn't even close the street.  No.  They just grabbed the camera.  He's supposed to be a regular guy  as he's walking down the street  and everyone's like, holy fuck, pointing at him.  He's sitting with like three Negroes on a stair.  He's going to remove his hat.  He's going to dump a straw hat.  They should.  Fucking Velcro sneakers. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, this is bad.  Keith comes staggering over.  Yeah.  Smoking.  He sits next to the black guy, shakes his hand.  Remember when people say Keith looked fucked up back then?  Yeah.  That's nothing compared to now.  He looks all right there.  He looks like a regular kind of guy there.  Yeah.  He looks like Jeff Conaway there.  Yeah, he kind of does.  All right, well.  It's terrible.  I hate that song. 
[01:02:00]  I like it.  It's a fucking...  I kind of like it.  Yeah.  What else was on that album?  T&A, I think.  T&A was pretty fun.  Start Me Up, obviously.  That's a good song.  Start Me Up.  Do you like Under My Thumb?  Under my thumb.  Storm.  There's a version of that on YouTube  where they sang on a...  I forget the show,  but it was a fucking great...  It was like one of those British shows.  It's from like 64,  Under My Thumb.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I like Piscopo's version  as Frank Sinatra.  You did it?  Under my thumb, 
[01:02:30]  that chick.  That's it.  It's from 66.  You know,  it's from the show...  It's from the show...  Is that good?  Ready, set, go is the show.  Oh, ready, steady, go.  Oh, ready, steady, go.  Yes, I remember that one.  I don't...  Mixed Outfit.  Under my thumb,  the girl who once had me down...  It's like dancing.  Dude, this dance is the fucking best. 
[01:03:00]  The girl who pushed me around...  It's a fucking original, though, boys.  Yep.  Do you know how many lead singers  ripped him off with his moves?  This look.  The whole thing.  This is the look they're going for now.  Yes.  Yeah.  This dance is so good.  He's just doing this little fucking...  How would you describe it?  I can't...  Gay?  No, but it doesn't look gay, though.  It's a bit feminine.  It's jerky. 
[01:03:30]  How is he still singing this song?  It's amazing.  It's like, in concert, now,  look at these women  in their awful 60s coats.  Yeah.  This is from 66, you said?  Yeah.  46 years ago?  Holy shit.  He's going to sing this again.  Yeah.  That woman who's dancing  and crying in the front row?  Yeah.  She's obviously...  She's probably lost both tits  or she's dead.  Oh, shit.  But, I mean, she's an old lady.  They're all old ladies now. 
[01:04:00]  Wearing a ditey.  She's had a whole life since then.  She needs to put on her paws  before she sits in a fucking hover-round.  They're going to play  two nights in Newark.  Yes.  At the Prudential Center.  Newark.  In December.  I think I want to go.  Why wouldn't they play  the Barclays Center there?  I know.  Everyone that's going over  to the Barclays Center.  Why aren't they playing there?  In Brooklyn.  Yep.  Why wouldn't they do that?  I don't know.  That's weird.  I don't know.  Maybe the dates weren't available  or something.  Maybe they're loyal to the other one  because they've worked it before? 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, maybe.  Maybe one's bigger.  Which is bigger?  The ones that have the...  The what?  Sorry.  I knew where you were going.  I'm not dumb.  It's so hack.  Girl.  Who?  Who?  Bill on Long Island.  Bill.  Oh, Bill.  Hey, fellas.  How you doing?  Good, man.  You're delaying Jacktober,  so this better be good.  Very quick.  Very quick.  The new Rolling Stones song  not bad, but hey, 
[01:05:00]  check out another old band  putting out a new album.  Aerosmith.  Love her a lot.  Yuck.  Do we have the new Aerosmith song?  I'm going to try to have  an open mind here.  Thanks, Bill.  Oh.  It's called Love Her A Lot.  Let's take a listen to this real fast.  We're sampling some new music  from some old artists.  Oh, yeah.  Here today.  It's not new.  It was posted in August.  No, it's still new. 
[01:05:30]  Hey, wait a minute.  Sounds like the Stones song.  Why are they burying Stephen Tyler's vocals?  That's burying.  This is terrible. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, there he is.  Oh, I just can't.  I don't hate it, but...  I can't.  I'm tired of Stephen Tyler.  He's kind of corny.  He is very corny.  He is very corny.  Give me some sugar!  Yeah!  Right?  Is that what you want?  It's fucking slug lips. 
[01:06:30]  Shut up.  Tie him bandanas around your face.  Yeah.  Yeah.  American Idol.  Shut it.  Where's the Wild West song?  Because more people say the Stones song  sounds like the Wild West.  The Wild West.  Yeah, yeah.  What is that?  The Wild Wild West.  Wild Wild West.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  This kind of has the same cadence as the Stones' new song.  I'm embarrassed.  Escape Club, I believe.  Escape Club.  It just hit me.  And I'm embarrassed to say I liked this one when it came out. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Put it in like this.  Guilty pleasure?  We got Pogo.  We're heading toward the 90s, living in the wild, wild west.  Heading toward the 90s, did that just say? 
[01:07:30]  Heading toward the 90s, yeah.  See, that was in the later part of the 80s, and we're heading toward the 90s.  Ronnie's got a new gun.  He mentions Ronald Reagan.  88, you think?  Yeah, this was pretty good.  I think I just threw out my back.  Oh, my God.  When was it?  88.  You're looking at the wrong thing.  88.  You're looking at Will Smith, Wild Wild West from the movie.  That's different.  You're not a child of the 80s like me and Ant. 
[01:08:00]  No.  Obviously, if you're going to the Will Smith version.  And, yeah, both those songs are only Bob Dylan's Subterranean Homes of Blue.  Are they?  Which is the same cadence.  No.  Yeah.  But you don't like the Dylan.  Hate the Dylan.  Love the Dylan.  Hate the Dylan.  Love the Dylan.  Rough Rider.  No, you don't want nada.  None of this.  It's running this.  Run the running this.  Fuck on those soldier.  Look, it's like I told you.  Any damn massive distress.  Be out of that dress.  Wish me, Jim West.  Rough Nets.  Hey, where are the white women at?  No kidding, man. 
[01:08:30]  What did you do to our song, man?  Ah.  You want to see my hand where my hip be at?  With Artemis.  You know, another good song I forgot.  I like the new Kiss song very much, too.  You know what?  Let's take a listen to that.  Hell or Hallelujah.  I really like it.  Sounds like Old Kiss.  I haven't heard of this.  I don't know if you'll like it, but I do.  Sounds like Old Kiss.  Let's see that.  I don't like that version of Wild Wild West.  People are saying play Mick Jagger on SNL with the Foo Fighters.  What did he do with them?  Hang on.  We're doing Kiss.  All right.  Fair enough. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, this sounds good.  That doesn't sound like the one I...  Wow, this is weird.  A little tech...  Oh.  Yeah, it's a song like that.  It's a whole song.  It's no lyrics.  Oh, there they are.  Everybody's putting out songs that are a little heavier than they have been. 
[01:09:30]  All right.  It's Stones, too.  And this is kind of the same thing as the Stones video, with the words on the...  And I made the best I had my way...  Because they don't want to spend the money on a good video anymore.  Yeah, it's just a lyric.  Motley Crue.  Motley Crue.  I like that. 
[01:10:00]  It sounds like Motley Crue with Paul Stanley as lead singer.  Very good for sure.  Yeah, a little bit.  It does.  It kind of has a Motley Crue sound to it.  I'm not a huge Kiss fan like Jim Norton, but it's all right.  Yeah, I like that.  They opened with it. 
[01:10:30]  I like it better than the Aerosmith song.  Me, too.  And I wouldn't mind hearing that in between the hits if I went and saw them.  Yeah.  They opened it.  When I saw them at Letterman's studio, they opened with that and then just did all hits.  Right.  They can't really play their instruments, though, huh?  Oh, yeah.  They're great.  Oh, Jesus.  Very basic with their instruments.  Wonderful.  Extremely.  What are they, the monkeys?  Dun, dun, dun.  Dun, dun, dun.  Am I right or wrong, Sam?  You're right.  Dun, dun, dun.  Dun, dun, dun.  Ba, ba, ba, ba.  Here comes the boom. 
[01:11:00]  What's going on with that movie now that Henry's gone?  Oh, boy.  It's a bad movie, right?  Which bombed, yeah.  What?  Did it bomb?  Well, when Henry Winkler said yesterday it took a year and a half to come out.  That's always a thing of concern, but did it bomb?  Yes, it did.  It came in fifth place.  It never gets better after the first week.  No.  Rarely does it get better.  But it's a comedy, too.  Those never beat things.  Yeah, but it's a Kevin James comedy.  Yeah, Kevin James, remember?  It's supposed to be terrific.  Why didn't we get Kevin in?  I probably just retrashed him over the years.  Dude, I love Kevin.  He probably doesn't even know we exist. 
[01:11:30]  You don't love Kevin.  I really do.  He's a nice guy, man.  Yeah, but do you love his comedy?  Yeah, look, it's not what I do.  I saw him with Adam Farrar years ago.  He fucking blew Kevin James off the stage.  He's a funny stand-up.  Adam?  Yeah, Adam, too.  I remember Kevin...  Fair enough, you would know better than me.  That's just an opinion.  But I remember Kevin before he got famous  when he was at the Strip,  and they were looking at him like he was the guy  you could feel the energy.  It was just before King of Thrones.  Because he had the look?  That's probably why. 
[01:12:00]  This guy's way funnier than Kevin James.  He's got the look.  But he gets some big fucking movies, this guy.  That Mall Cop movie is horrendously bad.  I never saw it.  Yeah, it's a bad one.  Do me a favor, Jim Norton, please.  Try to see that soon.  You'll get really mad.  I can't believe how well that movie did.  I'll be honest.  I only made it to 45 minutes in,  and I didn't laugh once.  And then I finally said,  I can't do this anymore,  and I turned it off.  So maybe the second half of the movie is amazing. 
[01:12:30]  I don't know.  I never saw it, but...  It's horrible.  I do like Kevin's comedy.  It's not his stand-up, at least.  I haven't really seen any of his movies.  He's never acknowledged that we even exist.  It was beaten by Argo and Sinister,  who were also opening.  Taken 2 in its second week.  Taken 2 is a juggernaut.  That's a big movie, and so is Argo.  It's a benefit.  Now, is Taken 2 better than the first?  Taken 2's gotten terrible reviews.  We've discussed the first movie.  Oh, Ad Nauseam.  Nope, I wasn't going to say that,  because that's one of my other crutches.  I love Ad Nauseam. 
[01:13:00]  Ad Nauseam.  Because that's what you do in any situation.  Ad Nauseam.  Yes, I do.  But people love Taken 2.  Yeah.  Yeah, when he says things like,  what I do best.  What are you going to do?  What I do best.  I like the first movie.  They put soy sauce in his hair.  There were problems with the first movie,  but I love the action sequences in the first movie.  A lot.  I liked that.  All right.  So, here comes the boom. 
[01:13:30]  Not doing well.  No.  No, that's why they're back to impress that.  And we wanted to do well,  because of the Dana White angle,  to be honest with you.  And Henry Winkler, nicest man alive.  He made $11 million.  What?  Wow.  I thought he made more than that.  No.  I thought I saw 22.  That's a bomb.  22 is what Taken brought in.  Oh, we'll make it up on overseas,  and after theater sales.  They will, though.  They will.  That's amazing.  Well, you know what?  This is what I have to say about this.  Kevin James is kind of dumb,  because you got a movie that needs help, 
[01:14:00]  and he probably should be on our show,  not to be cocky.  Probably.  We kind of talk to the same people  that he wants to go to.  We might not have tried to get him in, though.  We thought we should try to get him.  Wrong.  He's only doing TV.  Yeah, he's one of those I only do TV guys.  Only TV.  Yeah, good luck with that.  Yeah.  See how that works for you in the coming years.  Jeez.  Only doing TV.  What's that about?  TV.  That's dumb publicists.  Only doing it.  Yeah, but you don't even have to look good for radio.  Just come in here and fucking talk. 
[01:14:30]  Happy days continue.  Henry Winkler plays a teacher in a new comedy.  Oh, God.  They did not do it.  How could we use happy days in the graphic under Henry?  What could we put?  You know, people are still watching TV, though, eh?  Yeah.  10.9 million watched The Walking Dead.  Yes.  That's a big number, right?  Huge.  Is that a big number for any network?  The only thing that beat him was football.  That's all it did.  Didn't that break cable records? 
[01:15:00]  I'm not sure.  I didn't see it.  I'm not sure.  Is Walking Dead good?  Yeah, it's in the prison this season.  Or the beginning of the season, anyway.  I've seen the two episodes.  I saw the first one, much like, you know, everyone else.  But I've also seen episode two of that one, which is really very fucking cool.  Boy, it just gets gruesome.  Really?  Yeah, I like it. 
[01:15:30]  I like zombie shit.  It's a good show.  People love their zombies.  I guess it's that whole, um, it's like playing a video game, you know?  You could kill things, but you're not really killing anything.  If there were real zombies running around, eh, you could kill them.  Anybody.  It's like, oh, I'm not a killer or anything.  Oh, I could shoot that motherfucker in the head.  You know, because they're zombies.  It's your duty.  You'd have to kill them.  They're trying to kill you.  What's that?  It's your duty.  You don't really say it like this.  No.  What, you say duty? 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  Duty.  Right, exactly.  But I avoided that scenario.  It's hilarious.  Oh, did you?  What, too highbrow for the Sam Roberts show?  We could do some Jacktober.  Jack-tar!  Should we take a break before Jacktober?  Jack-tar!  What time is it?  I got an Obama clip we can play real fast before break.  Yeah?  Yeah, man.  He's talking about, uh, Nicki Minaj.  Yeah.  He's all about pop culture, this Obama.  He really is.  He's in touch with what's going on out there.  Uh, well, as long as he's in touch with that and not, you know, anything happening overseas. 
[01:16:30]  He was on the Yo Show.  What's the Yo Show?  The Yo Show.  It's like a top 40 show in Miami.  The Yo Show.  Why does the Yo Show get Obama and we can't?  They got a phone-er from Obama.  Really?  Why are these other shows on TV and we can't?  What's wrong with us?  Well, the Dish Nation shows are better shows.  They're just, uh...  They're just, uh...  They're just better shows than this show.  They're more focused than we are?  And the content's better.  Fuck.  And Yo?  Yo is better, too.  Fuck.  This is Michael Yo. 
[01:17:00]  Please welcome to the show the President of the United States, Mr. Barack Obama.  Alright, this is a fake.  No.  No.  It's not a guy doing a voice?  No, this is real.  Yeah, that's Yo.  Why would he agree to go on Michael Yo?  Because.  Come on.  It's Michael Yo.  Michael Yo.  He does Miami radio and he does a Yahoo.com show, entertainment show.  But this is like, uh, yeah, he's like the Elvis Duran of Miami.  Yep.  Come on! 
[01:17:30]  Yes!  How are you?  How's Miami treating you?  You know, Miami always treats me well.  And thank you so much for having me on.  I know the, uh...  You know, if you want to get out of the vote, then the place to go is the Yo Show.  That's right.  It's all about the Yo Show.  He can't talk.  The place to go is the Yo Show.  Did you hear that again?  Hmm.  Got distracted there.  Got to move backwards.  Yeah.  You know, if you want to get out of the vote, then the place to go is the Yo Show.  That's right.  It's all about the Yo Show. 
[01:18:00]  Now, I want to jump into it because I got a short time.  There's an elephant in the room.  Let's get it over with.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I have to ask you the question.  Could you...  He wants to get into it because he's got a short time.  He's on with the president.  What is more important on the Yo Show?  I would so agree with you, usually.  Yeah?  He probably was told, you got five minutes with the president.  That's not his decision.  That's because the president is doing five minutes.  Oh, I see now.  See, I thought it was the other way.  We have comedian Jim Norton coming in, so we have to wrap it up. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, no.  He probably was told, you got five minutes.  Oh, he's only got...  I would assume.  Well, that makes much more sense.  Unless they got a terrific phony phone call.  Right.  That could happen.  There's lots of crazy stuff going on.  Or maybe there's a tree on my house.  There's a tree on my White House.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house. 
[01:19:00]  How's everybody going to get out there and vote, Mr. President?  We got a little fat kid.  Runs around and little hooves are clip-claping all over the studio.  That old Nagel kid.  That Nagel kid used to leave peanut butter and everything.  Did you ever have anybody in a White House that just turned out to be just loyal?  I got a hog used to work for me.  I used to molest him in the back room while my other friend was doing song parodies. 
[01:19:30]  Parodies?  You used to molest the Nagel kid?  Yeah, I used to take him in the back and grease him up like a little pig and stick him.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, I never told that.  Yeah, he goes, yeah.  Sound a lot like Ted Shackler.  Uncle Scott.  About the Yo Show now.  I want to jump into it because I got a short time.  There's an elephant in the room.  Let's get it over with.  He's on the board.  I'll ask you the question.  A lot of people are upset.  But can you repair the relationship with Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj on American Idol? 
[01:20:00]  That's what people want to know.  You know what?  I think that they are going to be able to sort it out.  I am confident.  I'm all about bringing people together.  Working for the same cause.  So, you know, I think both outstanding artists are going to be able to make sure that they're  moving forward and not going backwards.  Now, which one is your favorite out of the two?  Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj?  You know, Mariah, she's actually done some events for us.  I've gotten to know her and Nick, and she's a wonderful lady. 
[01:20:30]  So, Nicki, I don't know, but I've got her on my iPod.  No, you don't.  Do you want a president of Nicki Minaj?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  As an undecided voter, I got my info.  It's Romney.  It's Romney.  I'm voting for Romney now.  He likes a Nicki Minaj song a bit.  He does not have it on his iPod.  The big monster one or whatever?  Starships?  Do you think Bobby just gets down to this?  I love this song. 
[01:21:00]  I'm going to start dancing to it.  This is dreck.  This is terrible.  Why?  She's going to touch the sky in her starship.  It's like fireworks.  What's that?  No, fireworks is good.  You do like fireworks.  Oh, fuck.  This is okay.  I mean, Barack likes this.  Fireworks is a better song. 
[01:21:30]  I would say that...  Yeah, yeah.  Fireworks is a better song.  I don't think...  I don't think Nicki Minaj sings very well.  Rapworks.  She's doing that weird thing with her voice.  It's starting to annoy me quickly.  I'm going to talk like this all day.  I sound like Carolyn Bergeron, but faster. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, oh.  I like a good oh-oh in a song.  You got to like a good oh-oh.  Why is she so popular?  It's okay, but it's not that great.  Kids like it.  They do?  You can see why it would be a popular song.  I hear she is a cunt on wheels.  Oh, yeah.  I've never heard anybody say anything, but she's a complete cunt.  Yeah.  I think you see her interview.  She seems nice, but she has a really weird accent.  I don't know where she's from.  She's from Queens. 
[01:22:30]  She's making her accent up.  She's a diva.  Is she when she talks?  She talks like that.  Yeah, she's putting it on.  Oh, she is.  Totally.  No pop singers wouldn't do that.  No.  Nope.  And she's kind of, I mean, yeah, she totally gave up on like being a rapper.  Like she gave up on the hip-hop crowd.  Oh, now it's just pop songs.  She's just singing these like really filthy, dirty songs about her pussy and whatnot.  And then she put her album out, and it was all like the most bubblegum, kid-friendly.  Yeah, that's where the money is.  Well, she's so stupid.  What's this song? 
[01:23:00]  Is this the same one we just heard?  No.  It sounds like it.  This is her other hit.  Is she not as good as you thought she was?  She made a choice that I disagree with for myself.  May I contribute?  Sure, Kenny.  When she was here, she would not allow canted shots, only post-pictures only.  From the waist up, by the way.  Waist up?  Why, she got a big old ass.  She's got to have a giant ass.  The ass has problems.  She had a rainbow wig.  Rainbow wig. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, that's rainbow, though.  Yeah.  But she did take post-pictures of people?  Like posts, yeah.  Can we stop the nonsense?  I'm going to rap right now.  I'm going to do this, and I'm time.  I'm going to do this, and I'm time.  Right.  I don't need to know now.  I'm going to give you time.  I don't know what to do.  I ride.  Are you British?  Are you from Queens?  What are you doing?  I like to be a scary monster.  I like to be a big monster. 
[01:24:00]  That is terrible.  She went to art school.  She was an acting major.  You know what I mean?  Oh, why is she?  Yeah.  So it's none of this fucking ghetto shit.  She's just got an image now.  I should do a movie with her.  You invented a new image first.  I'm her love interest.  Yeah?  Oh.  How would that go?  Yo, Nikki, what are you doing?  I don't know.  I'm just going downtown.  It's a toy.  Scene.  Nice.  Perfect.  Mentality mag making it hurt today.  He says, the Yo Show could get the leader of the free world, but somehow Kevin James won't 
[01:24:30]  go on your show to promote his shitty movie.  Yeah.  Oh.  That hurts.  The Yo Show.  The Yo Show.  Stop it.  You don't listen?  No.  And then.  The No Show.  Why don't we get him on this show?  And the president proves, once again, that he's one of the biggest fucking nerds going.  I like Nikki Minaj.  You think it was blacking up his voice a little for that?  No, not really.  I heard a little.  A little bit.  He was trying to slang it up a little bit.  A little bit more than, you know, the Yo Show. 
[01:25:00]  He doesn't have a Nikki Minaj song on his iPod.  He doesn't.  Oh, he does.  Do you think he has an iPod?  No.  No.  The president?  Yes, he does.  He doesn't listen to music.  Out of your mind, he probably has a very fucking extensive music list that he works out to.  No, it's too dangerous.  I don't think he listens to music.  I think he's a nerd.  Oof.  Tyra's looking weird.  She's looking more alien-like.  Wow.  She looks pretty cute there, though, I think.  No, she doesn't.  No, why?  No, why you just said that?  Because she looks more and more like a tranny every time you see her.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Well.  She really does. 
[01:25:30]  She's looking weird.  If she was a tranny, you wouldn't date her looking like that?  Come on.  A tranny.  Stick it right in her ass.  Maybe if she was a tranny.  Do I have to grab the cock?  Ah!  Just grab her hips.  Fuck her ass.  Well, okay, now that you put it that way.  She looks nice, man.  You know what, though?  She was in here once, and she's pretty fucking hot.  And she was so nice.  She was really nice to us.  Yeah.  She'll never come back, I'm sure, but she was nice.  You also didn't mention the fatty pig fat.  I was too scared, too.  Yeah.  No.  And the end of a pussy. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  I don't know.  There's something weird looking about her.  She's done something.  She added hair, so you're not distracted by the fucking forehead.  Yeah?  Yeah.  She's trying to Rihanna it up.  Big forehead.  Rihanna it up with a fucking fist.  Anyone else notice that Rihanna looks like a llama?  What?  Let's see.  Have you ever noticed that, Sam?  Oh, wow. 
[01:26:30]  There's pictures of her and a llama.  Oh, wow.  I'm not the first?  There's pictures of her and a llama.  We were at the Central Park Zoo, and we were taking pictures of the llamas.  And my brother-in-law, actually, I can't even take credit for her.  He goes, man, that looks like Rihanna.  And we're not the first ones to come up with that.  You're not the first one to come up with anything with the intranets.  I know, I know.  The second you go, hey, that person looks like that person.  And then you put it in Google, and there's 20,000 pictures of it.  See, look, this is the picture we took.  Tell me that doesn't look like Rihanna. 
[01:27:00]  There's Rihanna.  Llamas are dumb looking.  Llamas are dumb looking.  You don't like a llama?  No, they're embarrassing.  Look who's got something to Instagram today.  I don't know if you want to do that.  All these pictures are coming from Jocktober radio shows.  Uh-oh.  No, they're not, Sam.  You're just trying to fucking bust my fucking thing here.  All right, Charlie 105.  Someone, by the way, points out the new Rush record. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, I know.  I saw that, too.  Clockwork Angel.  Is it good?  What about it?  They say, according to the listeners, good.  Let's hear one Rush song.  New Rush.  All right.  What's the song?  Hold on.  I'd like to hear what it's called.  How long fight he recommended?  By the way, you know the Stone song?  Yeah.  Someone got the answer to that one, too.  What?  We were just missing it.  She's so cold.  I don't know that one.  I'm so hot for her.  I'm so hot for her. 
[01:28:00]  I'm so hot for her.  And she's so cold?  Yeah.  A few people saying that's the one you guys were thinking of.  She's so cold.  Okay.  Doom and Gloom, the new Stone song, kind of has that same riff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Possibly she's so cold.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Here's Rush, Headlong Fight.  Oh, boy.  Flight.  Headlong Fight.  Flight.  Or Flight.  Vintage footage in the video.  How about some full screen?  Yes. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, boy.  See what happens?  Yeah.  Well, if you knew what you were doing.  Yeah.  All right.  Starting it over because Sam hit the wrong thing.  Yeah.  Why are these guys not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?  Because the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is dark shit.  They're actually musicians.  They know how to play the fucking instruments.  Going to kick in?  Yeah.  It's a black and white footage on an old controller TV kind of thing.  It's old footage.  Yeah. 
[01:29:00]  Very technical.  Yeah.  All right.  We get it.  Neil Peart is fucking very good.  Yeah.  I absolutely like this so far.  All the journeys of this great adventure  Is there an old race for you? 
[01:29:30]  Another one that's just showing the words.  That's like...  It's the cut down on cross.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah, huh?  The best I've heard and that's enough to say.  Some days we're dark.  I wish that I could leave it all again.  I don't know.  Some days...  It's no limelight. 
[01:30:00]  I don't like it.  I like the music, though.  The lyrics are very we're back and better than ever type of lyrics.  Yeah.  I wish we could live it all again.  Yeah.  We're not...  We're rushed, but we ain't in no hurry.  We may be rushed, but we ain't in no hurry.  We may be rushed, but we ain't in no hurry.  I don't mind this. 
[01:30:30]  It's all right.  I don't know.  It's no red barchetta.  It's no ring in the limelight.  Him and his uncle dreaming by the fireside.  Sure.  You took my red car out, did you?  Get in here and dream by the fireside.  Big gleaming alloy air car was heading towards you two lanes wide.  That's right, yeah.  White, I told you, the bridge is singular. 
[01:31:00]  Take the bridge and leave him stranded by the riverside.  I didn't know Jimmy knew that much about red barchetta.  Then get back here.  Dream with me by the fireside.  Yeah.  Your white-haired uncle.  Yeah.  Get over here.  Uncle Paul.  Come to my farm.  He's rubbing his dick.  He's rubbing his dick.  Sure I am.  Jimmy rubs his dick.  No, it's not Jimmy.  Little Getty comes to the farm. 
[01:31:30]  And I showed him out in the barn.  I said, look at the red barchetta.  Here you go.  We're going to make sure your bottom's clean before you sit in the seat.  Oh, of course.  Why wouldn't it just...  Oh, my God.  I got to get in there and clean your bottom out.  Good.  What?  Before you sit in the...  You know what?  I don't want to put you in the driver's seat of the red barchetta with a dirty bottom.  The older my kid gets, the more I hate Uncle Paul. 
[01:32:00]  Why?  You're saying.  It smells like well-weathered leather, hot metal and oil, scented country air.  And you got the, the, the, uh, uh, something with chrome, uh, sunlight on the chrome, and  there's a blur of the landscape. 
[01:32:30]  Right.  And every one of your nerves is aware.  Get all those nerves aware.  Put you in the seat of the red barchetta.  Yeah.  Gotta clean their bottom.  Gotta clean their bottoms, because you don't want it to smell like dirty bottom.  Well-weathered leather, hot metal and oil.  You just want it to smell like leather, metal and oil.  Hot metal and earl.  And earl.  Well-weathered leather, hot metal and earl. 
[01:33:00]  Scented country air.  Get back here and dream with me.  By the fire, psych.  I got a fire lit.  Gotta check your bottom, though.  He's rubbing his dick.  I know he is.  Get in here.  I know.  Get in here.  He's rubbing his pants.  I'm going to punish you for taking a red barchetta out of the barn.  Of course.  I was just sitting you down, but you took it for a ride.  And that big alloy air car almost hit you.  Alloy air car? 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  Shot towards you two lanes wide.  Right.  What'd I tell you?  Yeah.  Fresh boy.  Because that's the way the new cars are in the old red barchetta.  It was gleaming.  Right.  Let me get in here.  Make sure you don't got no sweat down there to get all over the well-weathered leather.  I want it to smell like hot metal there.  Uncle Paul, you're despicable.  He's back here.  Dream with me by the fireside.  Of course.  I'll give you special milk. 
[01:34:00]  Put you under the afghan.  And you could dream about sitting in a well-weathered leather seat, and all of a sudden you sat on  something.  Felt like a big baseball bat.  We've now been chatting about red barchetta for five minutes.  You think Iraq would have just put it on in the background?  Why would he?  He's too busy thinking about Scott Shannon.  This stupid fat kid.  He's in there doing fantasy stuff with the wrestlers.  And if I hear it now, I swear I'm just going to lob something through the window. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, why would he put it on?  You never want a musical background on the radio.  He's very, very confused.  Are those the words to the song?  Put it on.  Sure they are.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well-weathered leather, hot metal and earl.  Scented country air.  I told this boy all that.  Oh, boy.  Oh, this boy.  Look at this.  The intro's 20 years long.  Doesn't this just plump you up pretty good?  Because you think the kid's coming to the farm again.  Right. 
[01:35:00]  I didn't have white hair until I saw all those charges against me.  Yeah.  Turned my hair white immediately.  And then my nephew said, what's wrong with your hair, Uncle Pearl?  I said nothing.  Uncle Pearl.  Uncle Pearl.  I said, I'm your white-haired uncle.  Oh, right.  Oh, God.  Good timing, too.  Yeah.  Nine minutes into the bed.  Nine minutes.  I said well-weathered leather 400 times. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, oh.  My country place.  Oh, go ahead.  Yeah.  Oh.  It's a secret place.  No one knows about it.  It used to be a farm.  Goddamn Motor Lodge came along.  Everybody got nosy.  Or loft.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I said, take the train to come see me.  Look at my white hair.  I'm waiting for you.  Yeah.  Uncle was waiting.  That's why I laughed.  Dug-a-dug, dug. 
[01:36:00]  Dug-a-dug-a-dug, dug-dug, dug-dug, dug-dug, dug-dug, dug-dug.  Yeah, and I'll hold their little hips and bounce them.  Dug-a-dug, dug-dug, dug-dug, dug-dug, and then you go, dug-dug-dug, dug-dug, dug.  Give them a little bouncy ride.  Hop that turbine freight, but don't get your hands all greasy.  Get in here quick.  Yeah, he's getting all excited.  That's the medicine I gave him. 
[01:36:30]  Sure, I'm in the barn.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, machine.  It's all for you.  This is like a song about the future, man.  Now I like to sit him down and tell him my dreams.  We get under the top.  While my aunt takes her sleeping medicine.  My wife.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You better vanish time, bad boy.  Yeah. 
[01:37:00]  All right, enough rush.  Turn it on.  That wasn't the roar.  That was me breathing into your neck.  Ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, I'll commit a crime, too.  Right in your bottom.  How great is that?  Yeah, his hair gets all muss with the wind.  That turns beyond.  Yeah.  Sure.  It's all mussy. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I give him a little Viagra, and his blood rushes through him.  He thinks it's adrenaline.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Guess his nose all stuffy.  Little Peter stands up.  Ha, ha.  No hairs on it.  Oh, Jesus Christ there, Uncle Paul.  Always going way too far.  Sure, sure, sure. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, don't get blood all over my well-weathered leather seat.  Well-weathered.  It's a little rush compared to that new rush.  Something's happening with Getty's voice after all these years.  Oh, fuck, you can't keep that high voice going for all those years.  It's a little grittier on the new song.  Oh, yeah.  He's older.  Smooth.  Yeah, I know.  It sucks.  I still like the rush.  I do, too.  Jim Norton's got a new CD out called No Baby for You.  How did they get this, Jimmy?  iTunes, it is available for pre-order.  Not out until December 11th, but it's now available for pre-order on iTunes. 
[01:38:30]  Very cool.  And a Sunday show has been on this week in Vegas.  Let's hope that sells.  But Helium Comedy Club is now October 25th through 28th.  The weekend is totally sold out.  There's availability on the late show Thursday and Sunday, and that's it.  So you can get tickets by going to HeliumComedy.com.  Helium Comedy.  I just got a disc called Bubba Talks Forever About Hogan Lawsuit.  Oh, shit.  What is he saying?  Because I don't feel like it's all allowed. 
[01:39:00]  It's ten minutes.  Oh.  That's the thing.  I cut it in two five-minute chunks for you, and you can let it play.  It's a huge story.  We should listen to it.  Let's hear something.  Yeah, we got it.  It's interesting in the sense that it's him talking about Hulk Hogan.  If we should just bail or...  Turns into Jocktober almost.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  But he gets very wordy with his shit.  Well, he's always gotten very wordy.  This is the first time he's talking about it.  Oh, he's still in the best.  It's sad.  It's sickening that a guy that's been... 
[01:39:30]  You know what Manson is?  Manson, Hogan is guilty of people glad-handing and coddling him  and succumbing to the fact that he's Hulk Hogan.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  Kissing his ass.  He's turning on him.  And I'm over it.  I'm over it, Hogan.  And I've only just...  Oh, Christ.  You're over it?  Really?  He's suing you for $100 million.  You think you're over it?  You're over it?  Guess what?  Own up to it, man.  He sounds very confident.  You fucking had something to do with taping him having sex with your wife at the time. 
[01:40:00]  And you're over it?  Yeah.  I'm over it, Hogan.  And I've only just begun.  Begun what?  If you're going to sue me and have a radio war.  We've only just begun to live.  Someone better keep an eye on E-Rock.  He must be on Suicide Watch.  Two of his favorites are now hating each other. 
[01:40:30]  Hulk Hogan and Bubba the Love Sponge.  Amazing.  You're going to be all right, E-Rock?  On the plus side, we get to listen to Bubba the Love Sponge.  This is almost as bad as when his other two heroes, Bubba the Love Sponge and Opie, were fighting.  He loves Bubba?  E-Rock loves Bubba.  E-Rock was being raised in Florida, going to high school with that speedboat.  Pretty cool, huh?  That's what show he had on.  Tell him, E-Rock.  E-Rock, tell him.  See, he doesn't want to be part of this because it hurts too much.  He doesn't want his voice on this segment in case Bubba's listening. 
[01:41:00]  That's right.  He's choked up because he tried to eat a whole cake at once.  Eric, it's breakfast.  Come on.  We learned he doesn't like a lot of desserts.  Root beer float, though.  That's a dessert.  Well, he likes Coke floats more than root beer floats.  Oh, so I didn't pay attention.  Yeah, he prefers a Coke float.  If you're going to sue me and Heather, then Heather and I will be deposed and we will tell the truth.  We'll tell the truth, buddy.  Man said he'd live with me for four months. 
[01:41:30]  He knows I have surveillance in my home.  I mean, Hogan, there is no wiggle room.  The only wiggle room was for you to shut up and take it like a man.  But unfortunately, you can't.  Ah, take it like a man.  The wiggle room is that fat cock wiggling into your wife's pussy, you fucking cuck.  He's getting it out there, though, that he had surveillance in the home and that Hogan knew he had surveillance in the home.  He's trying to cut this off at the pass.  He's definitely, he's testifying right here. 
[01:42:00]  He knows that anything he says can be used in court, so he's saying what is best for him.  And he's trying to get it out there.  And a part of me thinks that he wants Hogan to go, oh, okay, I'm going to lose the lawsuit.  Yeah, that ain't going to happen.  Take it like a man.  But unfortunately, you can't.  You can't step up and take it like a man because it's too painful.  Somebody has to pay.  Somebody has to pay. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, I think it might be you.  A hundred million dollars.  It might be you.  It could be you.  Because if you didn't press record on that old tape-a-roo there.  Yeah.  No one would know about this.  Right.  Just like you got out virtually scot-free when there's a Marine that's a vegetable for the rest of his life.  But there's no way it could have been your son's father.  Oh, wow.  Now you're turning on your best friend like that.  Oh, boy.  What a pal.  Wow.  That's a nice guy right there.  Oh, boy.  Now he's talking about the kid having the accident? 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  He probably supported fucking Hulk through that whole thing.  Jesus Christ.  When Nick did what he did.  Wow.  Eric, what do you think about Bubba shit-talking Hulkamania?  This is what I mean by Bubba being dirty.  He's always been dirty.  He's just a little dirty.  He'll turn on you in a second.  What a fucking...  Even though he's responsible for this whole fucking thing happening.  ...for the rest of his life.  But there's no way it could have been your son's fault now, is it?  There's no way that when he was at 14 years old, you bought him an 800-horsepower Supra. 
[01:43:30]  There's no way that that could have happened.  No way.  It could not have been that Nick was driving 85-mile-an-hour when it was raining in an 800-horsepower Supra  and wrapped it around a tree.  That can't be Nick's fault now, can it?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Wow.  It's just showing his character is what it's showing.  He's trying to kill Hulk Hogan's character.  You're attacking Hulk Hogan?  For something that you probably support him?  That his son...  Of course he supported him through it.  He supported Hulk through that whole fucking thing.  But a tape came out of Hulk fucking his wife. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, this has nothing to fucking do with the sex tape.  It just shows his character, I'm telling you.  This guy's always been slimy.  I'll say it a million fucking times.  Around a tree.  That can't be Nick's fault now, can it?  No.  That Bubba, can you go on the air and stick up for my son?  Yeah, I could.  And I did.  Oh.  And I was wrong.  Oh, were you?  Easy to say now, right?  I was wrong.  You're not going to hear any excuses from me. 
[01:44:30]  What?  What is this whole thing?  You're not going to hear any excuses at all.  And if various other radio personality and media outlets want to drive home the point that I'm on the end of the tape saying,  wow, if we ever wanted to retire, all we have to do is release this tape.  Yeah.  If you don't understand that, one, Hulk Hogan was within an earshot of me saying that, and two, if I really had that mentality, why would I say it?  Why would you tell on yourself?  You say that kind of stuff all the time. 
[01:45:00]  Right.  It's a joke.  Right.  We say it all the time around here.  Turd.  And so if I had that mentality, why would I be rich right now?  I would have sold it.  Two.  Two.  Two.  You think I would have maybe stopped the tape?  No.  Can you pause?  Sorry.  This is why I, and again, I don't know Bubba.  This is simply a thought or a guess on why he is saying this.  But when he says things like, you knew there was surveillance in my house. 
[01:45:30]  I said that he was in earshot.  Those are, to me, sound like legal things.  To me, those are trying to put out what are very damaging legal fires.  Right.  Both of those say this was done with your knowledge.  Uh-huh.  One is you knew there was surveillance.  Right.  Two, you were in earshot.  But neither of those things I don't think will hold up in court because there's no, first 
[01:46:00]  of all, you have to say that.  And Hulk wasn't there.  You didn't say it when he was standing right there.  No.  You obviously said it to your wife.  It sounds like something you say when somebody's out of earshot.  And Hulk, on the tape, basically, says he's got to go.  Right.  He's admitting that he didn't say any of this to Hulk, but his statements are that the  implication is that Hulk should have known.  Right.  That any reasonable person would have been aware of this, which is not true.  It seems to me there isn't one reasonable person involved in this whole thing.  You know something, brother. 
[01:46:30]  Except Heather Clem.  She took big Hulk dick over Bubba dick.  Smart move, Heather.  She really did just ride Hulk's dick.  She loved it, too.  Amazing, right?  I would have maybe stopped the tape.  You know.  You know.  You know.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry to my family.  I'm sorry to my girlfriend.  I'm sorry to my mom.  I'm sorry to my dad, to my stepfather, my sister.  I'm sorry to anybody who's close to me that, you know, I allowed myself to succumb to Hogan's  shady request of having sex with my wife. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  So you're basically saying, I'm sorry that you asked to fuck my wife, and I said yes?  Holy shit.  Yeah, perhaps, even if the request is shady, you don't grant the request.  How about Bubba?  No.  I wish Sam would succumb.  Bubba should just admit that he's still, to this day, a little boy wrestling fan, 
[01:47:30]  and wanted the Hulkster to have sex with his wife.  Sex with his wife.  Well, I had sex with your wife.  His wife's in a coma.  To Hogan's shady request of having sex with my wife.  I'm sorry.  Oh, yeah, brother?  It's not what a real man does.  And for that, I'm guilty.  But what I'm most disturbed by is that one of...  And they're running out of you.  And he's trying to admit to something. 
[01:48:00]  Like, he's not actually admitting to anything.  Right.  But he's trying to assume guilt.  He's attempting to own what he has to own.  But he's not.  No.  Right.  This is horrible.  But what I'm most disturbed by is that one of the three parties is now on a vendetta-ridden  tour to make the other two have to pay.  When everybody knew of what was going on.  Oh.  And it's a sad situation that whomever, or however this...  Yeah, everyone seemed to know, except for the part where you recorded it. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  If Hulk Hogan knew he was making a sex tape...  Yeah, we get it.  ...would he have gotten off the bed and said,  I can't believe I just ate, like, a fucking pig before this?  Like...  Look, the basics are, you know, Bubba and his ex-wife, they were swingers, obviously, right?  So they were...  And there was an agreement you could have sex with my wife.  Fair enough.  But you fucking taped it, you idiot.  That's what this is all about.  And Bubba's been on the air on Howard's show saying,  Howard, would you want to have sex with my wife? 
[01:49:00]  Should I have sex with you if you want to have sex with her?  What the fuck is that?  Well, get it on the air!  What is that whole mindset about?  Part of it is probably, he's, you know, he's dirty and he likes that to be...  No, no, no.  There's some fucking other thing than just a turn on.  There is some deep-seated psychological shit going in your head  where you have your wife and you want other men to fuck her.  That's a something happened to you back in your fucking youth,  in your upbringing, with your mom, whatever the fuck it is. 
[01:49:30]  That's a mental problem.  See, I don't understand wanting your friends to fuck.  That, to me, is the creepy part.  Like, I've thought of...  I don't know if I were to let anyone do it,  but I've thought of the turn on of girlfriends fucking people,  but if there was any face on the man...  The idea of a friend doing it is where it would be, like, disgusting to me.  Sam's got...  Sam's right, though.  Like, he's a little wrestling fan.  Yeah, it's a hero worship.  And he wants Hulk Hogan to have sex with his wife.  He wouldn't have let any of his friends fuck his wife.  I don't know about that.  I think you're wrong. 
[01:50:00]  I think he would have.  I bet he specifically wanted Hulk Hogan to do it.  And other wrestlers.  Maybe Bruce B.  You're a Hulk Hogan and my wife.  That situation, and whomever, or however this thing got out,  which that's really what we need to look for.  We really need a concert.  You had the only copy.  Yeah, what the fuck?  What is he talking about?  You know who got it out there. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  You have to have a very good idea if you had the only copy.  Now that copy, what did you do?  You started showing people, so...  You know who you gave copies to.  Exactly.  It all started with you.  You're the ground zero of this whole fucking thing.  It's not closed circuit TV.  Right.  You have a pretty good idea who got it out there.  There's a short list.  A very short list.  We really need to concentrate on who released this. 
[01:51:00]  Who stole it from whom.  That's what the true crime is.  Hogan, you owe Heather an apology.  What?  What?  But she won't.  For stretching her badge?  That's what you're all about.  You're about to prop yourself up in front of the camera  so that you can save your T&A job or save your wife.  Well, God forbid that any one of us suffer any consequences from this. 
[01:51:30]  We all are responsible for our acts and we all will suffer consequences.  Only one of us.  Out of the three.  Only one of us decide, Manson, to be litigious about this.  One of us.  Yep.  Litigious.  Well, now, Heather and I, hopefully, we'll join together.  And if there's a hundred million dollars, Manson will be made.  It's SummerSlam.  Oh.  How can you...  Who else would be litigious?  The people that taped the guy fucking or the guy who was taped? 
[01:52:00]  Yes, this is so stupid.  This is the worst defense I've ever heard.  Bubba, trust me.  Shut up.  Bubba, shut up.  Stop talking.  I know you...  I know as a person and as a radio guy, you feel the need to address it.  I understand that.  Trust me.  Shut your face.  Yeah.  And just talk to your lawyer.  It's so funny.  It's been a week and everybody is going, I can't believe Bubba hasn't talked about this.  Why wouldn't he talk about this?  Here's why he shouldn't.  Yeah.  Now we know why he shouldn't. 
[01:52:30]  Shut up.  It's him trying to play the part of the victim in this.  Him and his wife or his ex-wife, whatever the fuck.  It's ridiculous.  You see, here's where I would feel some empathy for Bubba.  If he came out and said something like, look, we always taped.  He did know that we taped stuff and he was very aware of this tape.  And what bothers me now is that he's coming back and pretending he wasn't aware of this  when he had actually seen this.  Or something along those lines, but I just don't buy what he's saying.  Yeah, I don't believe him. 
[01:53:00]  And then he's talking about the kid, Nick.  To me, that's just too much piling on.  Right.  And the way he's addressing this, I just am not buying it.  Yeah, he's shocked that Hulk is bummed out about this whole thing.  Yeah, why would he be shocked?  If he's saying, Hulk, why are you suing me?  You knew this tape existed.  Somebody who worked with me released this.  Right.  Hopefully, we'll join together.  And if there's $100 million Manson to be made, it should go to her.  That's who it should go to.  It's not going to hurt my credibility, Annie.  That's who should get the money. 
[01:53:30]  Not you, Hogan.  Hogan said, Bubba approved of the get-together to help the former wrestler deal with his crumbling marriage.  Well, that just shows you how stupid I really am and how he is.  Manson can just basically bamboozle anybody at any time.  Yep.  So, you know what, Manson?  I'm not making any excuses.  Mind control.  That's all there is to know about it.  Hogan is amazing at mind control. 
[01:54:00]  Back in the WWF days, he would mind control all of us and then leg drop on us.  On us.  Mind control.  He was tied into the harp system.  Thank you for your service.  So, Hogan, grab your best hold, my friend.  I hope that you depose Heather and I sooner than soon.  Oh, when's that?  So then, you know what? 
[01:54:30]  We can tell you the truth.  We can tell you the truth, buddy.  So, wait a minute.  So, Mancow, or is this Alex Jones?  Which one is this guy?  This is Bubba the Love Spine.  Oh, oh, there you sound alike.  God, I, I, I, Hogan fucked my wife, turd.  Turd, turd, turd.  Hogan fucked my wife, turd.  Turd.  It's on tape.  Oh, no, turd's selling it from a car doing 80 miles an hour into a wall.  Wait, let me go to this great phone call from Anthony.  No, can we do the Mancow thing today? 
[01:55:00]  Can we do the turd into the wall thing?  Turd.  No, I love this.  With the, with the production sound effects.  I do want to hear that.  Where we, we completely picked apart the sound effects and how phony it is.  There is a part two to this.  Dude, this is great.  Yeah, I really want to hear this.  Steroids.  Illegal.  You know, I, I, I gotta say, cause he's trying to defend himself.  There's, there's no way Hulk would agree to, to be taped having sex. 
[01:55:30]  I'm sorry.  And he's talking about his wife should be the one who's suing.  Right.  If Hogan was in earshot of Bubba saying, oh, we can retire off this.  There's no way he was, by the way.  He said it to his wife.  His wife was in the room.  Right.  Like, his wife responded to him saying that.  Here's what I think might be happening.  They're divorced.  Him and Heather are divorced.  Maybe they have an amicable relationship.  Maybe they don't.  Maybe he is worried about her suing him.  I wonder if, yeah, Heather knew they taped it and maybe Heather was down with that, but 
[01:56:00]  now maybe she had nothing to do with releasing it.  And if for the sake of argument, Bubba, let's just say Bubba released it.  Let's just guess.  Maybe he's worried about her coming after him with a lawsuit.  Right.  Right.  So maybe he's trying to publicly somehow side with her so she doesn't do that.  And according to Dunmire 45, Hogan said on Howard last week that Bubba and his wife begged  him for two years to do it.  Yeah, that's what Hogan's been saying.  They had conversations for two years of Bubba being like, oh, you should do this. 
[01:56:30]  And people are saying that Bubba's wife wanted to do it.  And he was like, okay, yeah.  I'm with him.  What's that about?  That's fucked up.  There's a deep-seated problem that that just.  There's a whole I'm not worthy type of thing going on.  Yes.  And even if you are the type of person to let your wife have sex with somebody else.  There you go.  It's not because they asked.  You know what I mean?  Never.  It's never.  It's your idea that you propose.  If somebody asked me, no matter who it was. 
[01:57:00]  What do you mean if somebody asked me?  Oh, my guess.  No, we have a request box that fucking.  I ran out of steam.  Oh.  Oh.  Let's do this now.  What happened there?  Steroids.  Illegal drugs.  What?  Womanizing strippers.  Groupies.  What?  I know it all, Hogan.  God.  Ask Macho Man how it works out.  He's dead.  How could you ask Macho Man?  He's saying he's going to kill Hulk Hogan?  Ask Macho Man.  No, he's saying Bubba killed Macho Man?  Oh, he did.  No, he's not saying that.  He's just saying that he's on your way to a doubt to a bad ending. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, when they were all best friends, all that didn't matter.  But now that they're not best friends, this guy who has wonderful character is going to  fucking tell the world what Hulk Hogan's all about.  What does he want?  Even though it has nothing to do with the sex tape.  What does he want Macho Man to be asked?  No, no.  Well, he said ask Macho Man how that turned out.  Meaning Macho Man's dead.  Oh, okay.  Because of all the partying he was doing.  All right.  Now I get it.  I didn't know what the fuck he was talking about.  And Hulk is going down that same road.  Not too good. 
[01:58:00]  Ooh.  Ooh, yeah.  And to the point where, Manson, we pretty much buried Macho Man in this town for Hogan.  Yeah.  I feel bad about that.  I've done your dirty work for years, buddy.  It's over.  Well, obviously.  He's suing you for 100 minutes.  I don't have a bunch of spiritual talent.  I mean, I think he told you it's over.  I'm sorry.  You can't be the second guy that says it's over, ever.  What an asshole to be like, now all of the opinions he's had over these years, Hogan  made him bash Macho Man and made him defend Nick. 
[01:58:30]  Why don't you just ask Rocky Balboa?  You know, because you weren't even supposed to hit him that hard, Thunder Lips.  In that ring, that was supposed to be a charity event.  What?  I defended you.  I told you to take that picture after I said it'll look good.  You know what's funny, too, is...  Oh, I fucking forgot what was funny.  I know, I know.  Jimmy's sleepy.  I'm the apnea here. 
[01:59:00]  Wait, I had a fucking thought about Bubba's suing.  It was funny.  It was definitely nothing on Bubba's show.  Oh.  No, this is a very, very...  I think Bubba's just making himself look absolutely terrible.  Yeah.  Like a turd.  Turd?  Turd?  I got the turd.  Don't worry.  Turd, are you in my wife, turd?  Turd, turd, turd, turd.  Talk to me, turd.  Are you in my wife?  Bad porno sound effects that we've all heard.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like a squeaking bed. 
[01:59:30]  Ah, yeah, turd!  What, you don't think the car screech was believable?  Oh, my God.  In the turd bit?  Not to my ears.  No, I don't think so.  I feel bad about that.  I've done your dirty work for years, buddy.  Oh, I know, dude.  I know what I feel bad for.  This poor guy, Manson.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  This guy, Manson, obviously has to side with Bubba, but listen to him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's terrible.  And he's just like, great, now I'm going to be deposed.  I got to fucking come in and deal with this legal shit.  Lie for Bubba. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  Bubba told Hulk it's over, so.  Yeah.  They're not friends anymore.  Hulk wanted to maintain a friendship through the $100 million lawsuit.  Right, exactly.  That's what's going on here, Bubba.  $100 million lawsuit shouldn't get in the way of a good friendship.  Yeah, but he's still calling off, hey, you want to go with the Olive Gordon?  Yeah.  Bubba went on his radio show to announce to the world, Hulk Hogan, you're not my friend  anymore.  Yeah.  Nah.  I have a new best friend.  I really thought their friendship would survive this.  Yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen, my new best friend, the ultimate warrior. 
[02:00:30]  Warrior says.  Warrior said, Hulk Hogan gave up his wife.  Remember those rumors?  What, warrior?  No, no, you're going down the wrong road completely.  Yeah, yeah.  No, warrior, tell him about like Hulk Hogan fucking my wife.  No, warrior knows Hulk Hogan.  Hulk Hogan's wife fucked every wrestler.  No, warrior, no.  No, warrior, you're not helping the situation. 
[02:01:00]  Eric was quick with the warrior music, by the way.  Really.  He loves wrestling music.  I just wish the ass man was involved in this somehow.  Dude.  Well.  Stephen Tampa with.  Of course.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Yeah, I'm an ass man.  He's an ass man.  What do you think Hogan did with Bubba's wife's ass?  Like, what does he like to do?  I, well, you know what?  What do you think?  Let me think.  I love him.  Huh?  Yeah.  I love to kick him.  Who does that?  I love to record him. 
[02:01:30]  I love to sing him.  I like to sing him.  I like to sing him.  I like to bash him.  I like to defend their son even by what they do.  Cause I'm an ass man.  Yeah.  Best WWF song ever.  Yeah.  Woo.  Cause I'm an ass man.  Yeah.  It's not the best ever.  Yeah.  What?  It's a new offer.  No, this is the best.  Ass man is the best fucking song. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  So little time.  There's not that much time.  On a dime.  Oh, yeah.  This is my favorite part.  Where do the best surprises come from?  The best surprises are we steeped up from behind.  From behind.  Oh.  Bubba's an ass man.  You should have worn a little comma.  A little.  Yeah.  No, you put a comma in there.  I did.  Yeah.  I'm a ass man.  Yeah.  Bubba looks like an ass man. 
[02:02:30]  That's how it fits in.  He burns the steel.  Anyway, Stephen Tampa, with underscores, he writes, uh, the illegal drugs, the steroids,  the twin towers.  I know it all, Hogan.  The twin towers.  You think Bubba thinks he knocked down the twin towers?  Hey, where are you going?  I did it for you.  You know what my favorite part of that ass man song is?  The whole thing.  Usually for wrestling songs, the guy who writes them, like, he'll write one verse, and it'll  just repeat over and over again. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  But, like, he got this ass man song, and he wrote this, there's three verses, there's  a breakdown, there's chords.  It's fantastic.  Yeah.  There's just all different words.  He didn't repeat anything.  No.  Mr. Ass was his muse.  Let's get past this audio, because we got Vic Henley standing by.  Very funny, Vic Henley.  I feel bad about that.  I've done your dirty work for years, buddy.  It's over.  I don't have a bunch of spiritual tattoos.  I'm not a fake or a fraud.  Oh, really?  You are. 
[02:03:30]  You are.  Oh, he goes, you are.  You're a scum.  Oh, no.  You're a scumbag.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He's a scumbag.  He's a scumbag.  Hey, you work for the Opie and Anthony show?  Hey, where are you going?  Where are you going?  You're a scum.  Wow, and a scumbag.  You're a scum and a scumbag.  You know that thing you didn't use when you were fucking my wife?  There's one thing we know about Bubba.  He's saying he's not a phony bone in his body.  It's not like he just went over a list of things that he pretended to support. 
[02:04:00]  Right.  He's not a phony.  Exactly.  He's not a phony.  He's not a phony.  He really wanted to help him out back then.  No, he was bamboozled.  He wasn't pretending or was he pretending?  Now I'm confused.  It was the mind control.  If he's not a phony, why does he use a fake radio voice?  I'm very confused here, Sam.  Can you break this down for everybody?  I'm professional.  Yeah.  I'm broadcaster.  You're a scumbag.  Ooh, shit.  You're not Hulk Hogan.  Do you think he wiped up Hogan's jizz with a love sponge and that's where it comes from? 
[02:04:30]  Like, you go, well, it's time to get my love sponge.  Bubba's love sponge.  And he just cleans up other men's cum.  I will tell you this.  I'm almost sure he was wearing a red and yellow bandana when he cleaned it up.  Oh, man.  Posing with it?  Posing with the Hulk's jizz, you think?  He asked his wife, hey, hey, my wife.  How was it when Hogan fucked you?  And then he scoops his ear up like Hogan.  Cum is just flying off his hand while he's moving his hand to go put it by his ear. 
[02:05:00]  He smeared Hulk Hogan's cum all over his chest and then he ripped it off.  He let it dry and then ripped it like a shirt.  He started flicking it off like the Hulk's fur.  Yeah, and then he goes, I'm a cum-a-maniac.  It's like that SNL skin.  Any more of that?  Yeah.  Look at this.  It's like Daniel Craig.  It really is.  What happened?  Jesus.  Wow.  He's going to rip off Keenan Thompson. 
[02:05:30]  He should do it right.  What are you doing?  Say that don't make no sense or something.  You're not Hulk Hogan.  Immortal.  I'll ruin your life.  I think you have.  I'm talking to his listeners.  You see my fat ass propped up in front of the courthouse steps and throwing my ex-wife  to the wolves and throwing me to the wolves so that you can what?  Fuck your wife?  Save your marriage?  It's not about saving his marriage if it's something that happened six years ago. 
[02:06:00]  What is he talking about?  Yeah, what is he talking about?  His new wife's what?  Maybe a year old at this point?  And they've only known each other a couple?  That's illegal.  I wish that was legal.  That's why Jim Norton's got CDs out there, people.  We got married when she was four days old.  Oh, God.  I traded her for two goats and some yak milk.  Oh, God.  I'm from another land.  Of course.  Going rate. 
[02:06:30]  I think he started dating his new wife four years ago.  All right.  So this is before her.  Yeah, years before.  So why is he saving his marriage?  Because Bubba is grasping at whatever straws he can grasp.  Man, Sam is all in because Bubba's taking shots at one of your wrestling heroes.  No, I'll go after Hulk Hogan.  For a woman that you didn't meet at the health food store?  You should have shut your mouth.  But you're a mark.  Shut up.  And you're just being churned by a stupid-ass attorney from Reno, Nevada. 
[02:07:00]  Which, by the way, Hogan, you know what?  Push comes to shove.  Push comes to shove like he did with his wife.  Push comes to shove, just like Hogan was doing with that giant cock it is, into his wife.  Pushing and shoving it.  You think Bubba's going to make a good witness?  I don't know how Bubba's calling anyone a mark.  Bubba's the biggest mark there is.  He's admitting how much of a mark he was because he's saying Hogan completely, like, fucking made him do things.  Everybody's known for you.  Bubba is a Hulk Hogan mark.  That's why he loves him so much. 
[02:07:30]  Yes.  And he does a lot of make-believe.  Yes, he does make-believe.  Because now he's telling his listeners all that shit I said, you know, and supported Hulk with.  That was all bullshit.  Let me tell you something, Hogan.  It's still real to me, damn it.  Are his listeners, you think, buying this shit?  I don't know.  Yes, because in between these two clips, it was like 20 minutes of phone calls.  Oh, boy.  Just, you know.  Oh, Bubba, you didn't do anything wrong.  Bubba, you're the best.  Bubba had a thing going on his show for months where he was arguing back and forth with the honky-tonk man. 
[02:08:00]  Look.  He's a mark for wrestling.  The honky-tonk man.  That's what he is.  Oh, God.  Bubba and his radio audience cannot take on Hulk Hogan.  I'm sorry.  He's Hulk Hogan.  Yeah, exactly.  Pasta mania.  Pasta mania in the house.  Mr. Shubb, look at David Houston's last case.  He just cost Joe Francis from the Girls Gone Wild $40 million in Los Angeles.  Mm-hmm.  What happened there?  But you're a mark.  That was that guy's last case? 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  Really?  Oh, boy.  You should have kept Heather's name off of your little fancy lawsuit, and you should have kept my name off your fancy lawsuit.  Really?  But no, you just have.  It's in your house.  Yeah, it's in your house.  It's kind of your house.  It's fucking your wife in front of your cameras with a recording onto your tape, which is your property.  But he should have left those names off.  There shouldn't be me on that lawsuit.  And what?  He's just like, oh, my best friend.  I don't have a lot of friends, but my best friend, I'll just decide to sue him for $100 million. 
[02:09:00]  Right.  Because I'm a mark for myself.  I'm a mark for me.  What an idiot this guy is.  This bubba.  Off of your little fancy lawsuit, and you should have kept my name off your fancy lawsuit.  But no, you just had to do it, buddy.  Oh, you want to hear the greatest?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You want to hear the greatest of all?  That's where he talks about me.  Hold on.  But Hogan married his current wife.  Let's stop the tape.  Enjoy that for a minute.  Not talking about you, fucking asshole. 
[02:09:30]  Shit.  Whoa.  Jesus.  Fucking shit.  I'm a Hulkamaniac.  I don't go for this shit.  This isn't funny.  No?  You like the Hulkster?  Fuck yeah.  Wow, he's excited about it.  What's your favorite Hogan moment?  Fucking when he would do the big leg drop, I would do it too.  My mother would go, stop doing that, Chipper.  You're falling all over the place.  Lamar's waking up.  Lamar.  He looked like Junkyard Dog.  And he was grabbing them cakes.  Shut up. 
[02:10:00]  You want to hear the greatest?  Yeah.  You want to hear the greatest of all?  Yeah, please.  When Hogan married his current wife.  Oh, boy.  Guess whose prenup he used?  Mine.  Oh.  Mine.  So that means other men would be able to fuck her?  Is that in your prenup?  Other men can come in and fuck your wife?  Yeah, who cares?  He used your prenup.  What does that even mean?  Yeah, what does that mean?  Then you're a mark for him because you paid the legal fees to have it written up. 
[02:10:30]  Right.  And he just said, yeah, change that name and put mine.  Hulkster, do you want to use my prenup?  It's a good prenup.  Let me tell you something, Hulk.  I got a prenup.  Why don't I just give you my prenup?  And you use that one.  Who cares?  If you're friends, who gives a fuck?  That's the type of stuff maybe you discuss among friends.  It's what buddies do, buddy.  It's what buddies do, pal.  I wish I could use Stern's radio contract.  I'd be happy to sign that one.  They just move the decimals over.  You're like, drat.  I know.  I understand.  See?  I know I understand. 
[02:11:00]  So not worth that money.  Bobby gets all the Hulkamania t-shirts in the prenup, though.  Oh, wow.  I get all your Hulkamania t-shirts.  I get all the swag.  Yeah, I get your old championship belts.  Mine.  He took my prenuptial agreement.  Does the fuck?  Used my attorney, Regina Hunter, for free, which he stiffed, by the way.  Imagine that.  Yeah.  Made it even more ironclad.  Good one.  But even when he's stiff and you're a lawyer, you continue to be best friends with him until the lawsuit. 
[02:11:30]  And if there's one thing lawyers don't pipe up about, it's not getting paid.  Lawyers are bad about collecting money.  Yeah.  It's really tough to stiff a lawyer.  Yeah.  Those fucking ghouls.  He threatened her with a big boot.  But do you see what's going on here?  He has all this info on Hulk, but continue to be best friends with him until it all went bad.  Hey, but that's what he does.  He collects things.  Right.  And that way, if he needs it, he can use it against it.  And that's why he wanted to keep the tape.  Thus then, dirty.  Slimy. 
[02:12:00]  I don't hear any...  His character is dirty.  I don't hear anything that's making me dislike Hulk.  Sounds like Bubba's a scumbag.  Yeah, his character's bad.  He's a terrible person.  All the signs were there, obviously, Bubba.  So why'd you continue being best friends with him?  Sorry, Eric.  Because you love the fact that someone like Hulk Hogan was close to you?  He made it even more ironclad.  And that's what he used.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:12:30]  That's Hulk Hogan.  Yeah.  I've only begun, Terry.  And I beg you.  That's never good.  That's never good.  Oh, man.  No, he called him Terry.  I thought his name was Hulk.  I thought it was Hulk.  It's on the lawsuit.  He must be Shivo.  I've had enough of your just sitting there making that dumb noise.  Turn the brains.  You're just sitting there going, ah.  I hired you to do voiceover work.  And you're just going, ah.  Terry, I've had enough. 
[02:13:00]  Never good when you use the real name, man.  When my haters say, Greg, it fucking hits my soul.  Because the officer gets hurt.  Yeah.  Because that's you.  That's right.  You know?  And that's a not well-known thing.  Terry.  Terry.  Oh, man.  That's a low blow.  Begun, Terry.  Like she can't hold.  And I begged you on Friday.  We were texting back and forth.  I begged you on Friday not to sue me for $100 million.  Yeah, no shit.  Please. 
[02:13:30]  Please, Hulkster.  You know I'm the Hulkamaniac from back in the day.  Please.  I begged you on Friday.  Don't sue me for $100 million.  I'll let you fuck my wife.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, shit.  What else can I offer?  Hulk Hogan.  I've only begun, Terry.  Terry.  And I begged you on Friday.  We were texting back and forth.  I begged you.  Stop it, Terry.  Stop it.  This will go away.  Stop it.  We need to concentrate on who releases.  You did me dirty, brother.  What do you mean I did you dirty?  You did me dirty.  You drove me insane to have my wife. 
[02:14:00]  You can't get any more dirtier than that, buddy.  And then you get caught and you act like you didn't know anything.  That's the typical Hulk Hogan MO.  He didn't know about the taping part.  Keep it with the facts.  He didn't know about the taping part.  This is when I loved you, Hulk.  Is that Bubba?  That's Bubba.  Look at him in his eyes with the hero worship.  Oh, my God.  He loves Hulk right there. 
[02:14:30]  I love you so much, Hulkster.  You love him.  Where are they?  Probably one of his radio gigs that Hogan used to do all the time.  You told him to step off?  Are they holding hands in that picture?  Step off.  Step off.  When I die, I'm going to be another Hulkamaniac in heaven.  Save a seat at Wembley.  I love that album, by the way.  Yeah, it's a good one.  Is he holding Hulk Hogan's thumb in that picture? 
[02:15:00]  It does look like they're holding hands.  That looks like a gay marriage.  He's trying to slide his finger into his palm.  Yeah.  Just hold me, Hulkster.  He's pointing at Hulk's big thermos cock.  Look, that's what I want.  If I can't suck it, I'll just kiss where it was.  Well, we found Sam's line.  Don't fuck with one of his wrestlers.  Oh, man, right?  Exactly.  He's been kind of tired looking today until this hit.  No.  Now you're all about it.  And then you get caught, and you act like you didn't know anything.  Mm-hmm.  That's the typical Hulk Hogan MO. 
[02:15:30]  Oh.  Is it?  But you were friends with him.  Best friends.  I'm over it, bud.  That's a great guy to hang out with.  There's a definitive line in the sand.  Mm-hmm.  I didn't break man code.  Bubba's drawing the line in the sand.  Yes.  I will not be friends with you when you're suing me for a tenth of a billion dollars.  Boy, this guy doesn't take any shit.  No.  I would have tolerated 50 or 60 million, but a tenth of a billion is when I stop inviting  you over to fuck my wife who doesn't live here anymore.  That's why I got a joke in the sand.  Jesus, Bubba. 
[02:16:00]  There's a definitive line in the sand.  Mm-hmm.  And I didn't break man code.  Yeah, I did break man code.  You didn't break man code?  Man code.  Secretly taping your friend as he's fucking your wife, I think that's breaking man code.  Where does man code fit into this situation at all?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We had a bromance.  Yeah.  Man code.  Wow.  Part of that was me begging you to fuck my wife, and then you finally did it.  That's bad.  Your pinky promised you wouldn't sue me.  Your pinky promised.  How can you believe anything this guy says? 
[02:16:30]  He follows man code, Opie.  He follows man code.  He follows man code.  You swore and said stick a needle in your eye if you were lying.  You're lying.  I swear I'm not six years old.  We follow man code.  Yeah.  Could someone explain the man code that's in play here, please?  That's what you have to adhere to in the man cave.  Man code.  It's the man code.  You fuck my wife, and then I tape it secretly to jerk off to it later, and then somebody takes  it, and you don't sue me.  That's man code.  I know man code.  Oh, okay.  Dot, dot, dash, dash, dot, dash, dash, dot, fuck my wife. 
[02:17:00]  And his listeners are buying all this.  That's sad.  The Bubba Army.  Some of them are.  The Bubba Army.  The Bubba Army.  A lot of them probably aren't.  The ones that are getting through on the air.  You think the Bubba Army is breaking ranks at this point a little bit?  The Bubba Army is breaking ranks.  Yeah.  The Bubba Army couldn't defend my wife's pussy against Hulk's big cock.  Well, you know, there used to be a Hulkamania brand to the Bubba Army, and that's true.  Really?  He sold Bubba Army t-shirts with Hulkamania across the front of it.  Jesus.  That's true.  That's awkward.  Linda Hogan accused Hulk and Bubba of having a gay affair. 
[02:17:30]  She didn't say that, right?  Was she accused Hulk and Bubba of having a gay affair?  That's what I do have to say, because I don't want to be a part of this bullshit ever.  I don't know.  That's what someone tweeted.  I have no fucking idea.  That's when Linda Hogan was talking shit.  She accused Hulk and Bruce the Barber Beefcake.  All right.  She did say that, right?  Bruce the Barber Beefcake.  Definitive line in the sand.  And I didn't break man code.  Yeah, I did break man code.  Oh.  I broke man code in the sanctity of marriage.  Oh. 
[02:18:00]  The sanctity.  I was a mark for you, and I was an idiot.  And I believed your hype.  What?  And I let you brainwash me.  Who is?  Brainwash.  And all those tattoos that you have on your body and the spirituality and feng shui and all this.  It's crap.  Feng shui.  You're the ultimate.  Could you put your wife's head face in the North, brother?  It's bad karma.  If I fuck your wife in the ass when her head is facing east.  Feng shui.  Feng shui.  I told you you needed to have a water and a wood. 
[02:18:30]  Is that what feng shui is?  Yes.  Feng shui.  It's idiocy.  No, I believe in some of that feng shui.  I need to live in places where I can see the sun go down.  Is that it?  You just like that, though.  What?  It's not feng shui.  You just like it.  Some people like seeing the sun rise.  Yeah.  I see the sunrise highway.  Sunrise highway.  Yeah.  Look at this picture.  I'm mad because Hulk Hogan's wife is here.  He doesn't like when Hulk's wife is there.  No.  He's trying to hold Hulk's hand.  He's still trying to hold Hulk's hand. 
[02:19:00]  What is that?  Is his hand in Hulk's pocket?  Oh, wow.  Is he fucking weird?  What is going on, Paula?  I thought we were having a bro-code day.  Get your wife out of here.  Yeah.  If you want, you can fuck my wife, though.  You're breaking the man-code.  The man-code.  Let's go watch WrestleMania 6 again.  This Bubba's a loose cannon, though.  I think some shit's going to come out now.  Yeah.  He's threatening all sorts of things.  He really is.  Spirituality and feng shui and all this.  It's crap. 
[02:19:30]  You're the ultimate lying, working showman.  Still a good showman, though.  Bubba is a dumb person, right?  Yeah, he's not a smart dude.  No.  Because doesn't he understand all this shit he's saying about Hulk now means that his character  is horrible, that he would hang out with a guy like this if he thought all this stuff  about him?  Doesn't he understand?  There's another way to handle this if someone close to you does you wrong or whatever.  You don't do it this way.  You don't go back and then take everything that you defended him for and now say that 
[02:20:00]  that was bad.  Because it makes your character, I'll keep saying it, look horrible.  How can you be so influenced by somebody that you just hand your wife over to be fucked  by him?  Even though you don't want to, apparently.  He said he was brainwashed into doing all this.  How much of a simple...  You use Papa Shago to do a voodoo curse on him.  It works on the weak-minded.  Hey, this is not the wife that you wanted a sanctity of marriage, brother. 
[02:20:30]  I'm going to fuck your wife.  You're going to fuck my wife.  Yeah, I don't know, man.  The ultimate lying, working showman.  He's a Jedi.  So you hung out with a liar all those years, huh?  Ask Warren Sapp how it works out.  His pants are on fire.  Ask Randy Macho Man Savage.  God bless his soul.  My next call is to Linda Hogan.  I'm going to call your ex-wife. 
[02:21:00]  Benson, call me a flip-flopper.  Wow, now you're going to fuck...  What a dick.  You can tell.  I'm a great friend.  I'm going to call your ex-wife now.  Yeah.  Who's done nothing but drag me and you through the mud.  Who cares if you call my ex-wife?  Go ahead.  Yeah.  Calls to Linda Hogan.  Benson, call me a flip-flopper.  Flip-flopper.  Or call me somebody that finally, that finally needed some, I don't know, catastrophic event  to open my eyes.  What's a catastrophic event? 
[02:21:30]  Into a real, into a real dirt bag.  Oh.  What is he talking about?  So Hulk's a dirt bag because you secretly taped him having sex with your wife and now  he is pissed off and wants to sue you for a hundred million.  It's his tape of a guy fucking his wife that he's on the tape of.  That he had complete control of.  In his house.  This just makes no sense.  No.  This don't make no sense.  Exactly.  Oh, SNL.  Yeah.  Live from New York.  I'm going to call Jimmy Hart.  Oh, shit. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  And all you other radio personalities right now that want to say, you know what?  You people know, you know what?  You people know the true story now.  Do we?  I'm being spun as the best.  Yeah, this is way better than I thought it was.  Yeah, exactly.  To be honest with you.  Right?  This is way better.  So I'm sure we're lumped into the radio personality category right now.  Sorry, I'm a little tired this morning.  I was up late watching Monday Night Raw.  I'm a big fan.  I'm trying to find the next guy to fuck my wife.  See you, punk? 
[02:22:30]  If you're out there listening and you're looking to fuck someone.  You want to fuck my wife?  Well, we know there's a real story now.  You people know.  You know what?  You people know the true story now.  Well, thanks for that.  You know, fuck Bubba's wife, Max.  I'm being spun as the bad guy because I'm on the end of the tape saying, oh, man, if I  wanted to ever make a million dollars and retire.  Yeah.  Otherwise, it's going to take a hell of a lot more than a million dollars for me to have  to retire and keep my lifestyle going.  I ain't a lot of food.  All kinds of things going on.  And so the guy has a smart ass with, while he's, while he just got done having sex with  my wife. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  And in within ear shout.  Shout.  Say.  Ear shout.  Ear shout.  Within ear shot.  That is so flimsy sounding.  Within ear shot.  Isn't it way later on?  That part?  I don't know, but it sounds very, very flimsy.  It was within ear shot.  And after I said it, we never had a conversation about it.  Right.  And why don't you explain why you said that?  Were you joking?  My wife was within cum shot.  Manson knows. 
[02:23:30]  Manson knows I was joking.  I was joking, right?  You were joking about me.  I was within ear shot of the cum shot.  Yeah.  I covered my ear.  How do you think?  I had to be in there to clean the cream pie before it went dry and crusty.  Yes.  She rolled her legs up and pushed like she was giving birth to a cream pie.  And I gobbled it up.  Was he doing that?  That's my way of hulking up.  Yeah.  I'm a Hulk-a-manial.  I want the Hulk superpower.  Yes.  I want to raise my arm after the third time in a sleeper hold. 
[02:24:00]  I eat my vitamins and his cum.  Yeah.  Yeah.  By default, I did steroids.  I ate cream pies.  Oh, my God.  Is steroid cream pies?  You can't hear on the tape where I'm going yummy, yummy in my tummy.  By the way, Manson, how's my mustache coming in?  I've been working on this.  And within ear shout, say, well, man, if I ever want to retire, I could release this tape.  Yeah, you said that.  My wife then says, man, you would never do that. 
[02:24:30]  And I said, yeah, you're right.  I wouldn't because I'm not a scumbag like that.  Oh.  That must be the case.  So, Manson, don't I pretty much just validate the fact that I'm being a smart ass when I say that?  Yes, you do.  Cool.  The jury is convinced.  Drop the lawsuit because Manson's the tough one.  If you can get through Manson, you can convince anyone.  You don't have to convince your lame fucking sidekick.  You're going to have to convince a judge and a jury.  No, no.  That's the Ben Casey test, they call it.  If Manson says yes, then you got a case. 
[02:25:00]  Can I say that?  Yes, you do.  But you know what?  You got these radio personalities, namely dumbass Orlando, who's grasping even to save his radio  station and format because he's done, was to make that eyebrow.  But you know what?  Thank you, cowhead.  And thank you, other personalities that can see through this and know what Hogan's really  all about.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Is he being sarcastic there?  Does he know what sarcasm is?  I don't think he's being sarcastic.  Cowhead must have said something positive.  Well, he probably has to because he's on, isn't he on the same station? 
[02:25:30]  Oh, yeah, they are on the same channel, right?  Yeah, cowhead's on the afternoon.  I can't speak for cowhead, but I would almost guarantee he's loving this.  I would love to get cowhead on the phone and ask him what he thinks.  We don't want to put him in a tough spot.  That'll be up to him.  Yeah.  Thank you.  That's what I'm guilty of, being a smartass.  What?  Smart aleck.  Breaking my marriage vows to the woman that was supposed to be, you know. 
[02:26:00]  Shut up.  What?  That means they didn't understand him.  What are you talking about?  His sacred marriage.  He's making it sound like he was the best husband.  She's the best wife.  They were loyal to each other.  And the Hulkster looked in fucking Bubba's eyes.  And like a cartoon, those electric fucking hypnotic things went right into his peepers.  And he was like, please fuck my wife. 
[02:26:30]  Hogan, fuck my wife.  Look, it's a strong indication that we're swingers.  We have swingers that listen to our show.  So, I mean, what are you talking about?  Yeah, baby.  You had an understanding with your wife.  Yeah.  It's fine.  Yeah.  It's fucked up is what it is.  I think so.  But people, you know, out there, that's their thing.  Unless there's something.  I never understood that.  Unless what I've heard where Bubba, unless this was known, unless he's saying that Hulk 
[02:27:00]  really like, man, you knew this and you've seen this tape and we've talked about it, then  Bubba has a legit point.  But that won't come out until I guess the fucking lawsuit.  Let's just say there was the tape.  Hulk would not allow that.  He would tell Bubba, as my best friend, you've got to fucking get rid of that.  Can't do it, Hulkster.  Marriage vows to the woman that was supposed to be, you know, not have to go through something  like that.  Well, hold on.  Where was she going when she said, your big dick feels so good inside me? 
[02:27:30]  Yes.  Toward the torture of a big cock on the best built guy in the country?  Well, you're like, how did you put her through it while you were sitting there?  Wait, I was going to come in there.  I did a sit up in 1984 and I'm unshaven and I have sunglasses and a Tampa Bay hat.  Jesus Bubba.  I don't know how big your dick is, but you can't be packing what the Hulk is.  Repeat with the Hulk's thermos.  Why would you have to put her through having sex with this six foot seven well hung phenom? 
[02:28:00]  Why would I give her the biggest thermos cock of her life?  That she climbed on and sat down on and then jumped back up on and apparently made a lot  of cumzies.  Yes.  She seemed to like it.  Of course she'd, who wouldn't?  Not have to go through something like that.  Yeah.  Screw you, Hogan.  Ooh.  Screw you.  Oh, man.  That's the side of the story.  That's what he was saying.  That you guys are not being reported.  That's the side of your, you didn't really prove anything.  No.  You didn't prove the case at all.  No.  Good luck with that, Bubba. 
[02:28:30]  All right.  Have fun with that.  Now, what are they saying about Lindsay Lohan in the news?  Where does he go after that?  Iraq hasn't laughed once, Travis.  Oh, man.  Travis had his eye on Iraq.  What's the matter, Iraq?  Iraq.  Iraq, what's going on with you, buddy?  Is this just that you're two heroes fighting?  It's coming in, according to Travis, so don't get mad at me.  He hasn't laughed once during this segment.  Not once, Iraq?  I think I'm taking this very seriously.  Iraq, what's going on?  It's been an hour.  You have a resume into the Bubba's show? 
[02:29:00]  He wants to be the new Manson?  What do you got?  What's going on?  Nothing.  Oh, man.  Now, what's going on in the spotlight?  There's not one laugh in the last hour.  You're torn with this one, huh?  I laughed at it.  I was laughing at the impressions.  What's the matter?  Why is this hurting you?  Iraq knows a lot about radio.  What the fuck's going on, Iraq?  Iraq, comment?  I don't know.  Say it.  Just say what you're thinking.  Yeah, Iraq doesn't want to break man code.  Just don't say what you're thinking. 
[02:29:30]  You know what you're allowed to say and what you're not allowed to say as far as lawsuits  You could say how you feel about this whole thing.  Yeah, what's going on with you?  That's fine.  I think it's a really shitting situation.  I think Bubba's a piece of shit.  He's always been a piece of shit.  Oh, man.  And, you know, I've known other people that have dealt with him in the last 15 years,  and they've all been fucked over by this guy.  Is it hard for you to hear the Hulk being talked about this way?  Yes.  Oh, so you're really pissed at Bubba.  Jimmy just goes, ugh. 
[02:30:00]  You don't like your hero being talked about this way?  No.  Not at all.  It's bothering you?  Yes.  Why?  You want to protect Hulk?  Yes.  You want to give him a hug?  I kind of do.  And say, Hulk, come on, buddy.  It'll be okay.  He'll go, thanks a lot, brother Eric.  I'd love nothing more.  People hate how happy Sam is, and Iraq's just bummed.  Eric, can I ask you a favor, brother?  Oh, anything, Hulk.  Could you give me Sam's phone number?  That'd kill him.  I want to put the thermos in, Jess. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, God.  Iraq, you better look out.  He could bamboozle you, just like you did.  The mind control?  Yeah, mind control.  Iraq, you don't like Hulk being talked to like that?  He does not deserve this.  Not at all.  Why?  Hogan hasn't done anything to warrant any of this shit.  I know people hate him, but he's still Hulk Hogan.  What would you say to him if you could?  Would you hold him?  I don't know what I would say.  I think I'd freeze up.  Well, how about now?  Just pretend then. 
[02:31:00]  It'll be okay.  Give him a hug.  What's going on here?  Pat him on the back.  Can you sign these?  I mean, you're a schlemiel.  I'm sorry.  He had the chance to say something to Hogan last week.  Yeah.  He was in the room with me when I interviewed him.  Yeah.  Did he say anything to him?  No, I did not.  Did it hurt you to see him that hurt?  It was sad.  It was very sad.  A lot of people have quit Bubba's show.  Why?  Better opportunities. 
[02:31:30]  He also tries to own every single thing, every aspect of your life if you work for him.  So if you have some kind of photo or nickname, whatever, he trademarks and copyrights it without  telling you.  Really?  And then he says, that's my intellectual property.  I own it.  This is what E-Rock said.  I have no idea.  Yeah, E-Rock.  Stop getting yourself sued.  Don't rope us into your litigation.  Yeah, I don't know.  Big mouth.  Bubba could use the money right now, too.  Bubba's dirty and slimy.  I don't want anything to do with him.  I would love Bubba just to sue E-Rock after this whole segment. 
[02:32:00]  I want that fat Nagel kid on a stick.  Scott Shannon joins in.  Yeah.  I hope he just copyrights E-Rock.  Right, but try me too, Bubba.  Bubba's a big Scott Shannon fan.  Really?  Watch him soon for that.  I'm not making that up.  I never enjoyed that fucking mealy mouth hack.  You think Eric would enjoy going over to Bubba the Love Sponge's house and listening  to old Scott Shannon tapes?  Oh my God.  He would love it.  And Bubba could convince him, he goes, I got some more tapes for you, kid.  He'd look at the Hulk.  Yeah.  This is Hulk eating a burrito. 
[02:32:30]  Bubba has a whole Hulk Hogan library.  You have him doing different things.  It's a hidden camera in the kitchen of E-Rock eating.  I have to tinkle.  Yeah, we got to take leaks.  Poor Vic Henley.  Apologies to Vic Henley.  Oh, Vic.  We didn't realize this was going to go that long.  We'll get in here.  Yeah, but he'll be in for a good solid hour and we're going to maybe still do Jocktober,  even though that seemed like a Jocktober segment to me.  It certainly did, but we'll figure it out. 
[02:33:00]  Stay there.  Sirius XM.  It's the O.P. and Andre Show.  Sometimes I feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clear. 
[02:33:30]  I guess this is Vic Henley's music, huh?  We have never played this before on our show, but I guess this is what Vic requested before  he comes on our show today.  Who was that, E-Rock?  That was that band...  Incubus.  Yeah, Incubus.  Sure.  Drive.  You like that song?  I know the song.  Yeah, yeah.  It's the softest thing they ever did.  They're doing the old metal thing.  We'll sing a soft one and get a hit.  You know, with a voice like that, you're so voting for Obama, right? 
[02:34:00]  I only voted for anybody ever, and I voted for Obama in 08.  Oh, you did?  I registered and voted for Obama in 08.  I've never voted for anybody ever.  But you don't have a voice, though.  But for spite.  Fuck, man.  My fit doesn't work.  I grew up around a bunch of idiots who are going to scream the N-word and call him every  horrible thing, and I'm like, you know what?  You're sitting next to one.  It's fine.  It's fine.  I love it.  I don't care, but I voted for Obama to give the...  Sounds like a great bunch of guys.  I voted for Obama to give the hot dick in the eye to racism. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, man.  Hot dick in the eye.  But here's the question I got for you, Vic Henley, who's a very funny man.  Four years later, do you vote for Obama again?  I don't think I vote this year, actually.  You go back to not voting.  I'm going back to I don't give a shit.  White guy's going to win.  White man's going to win.  White man's going to win.  Money's going to win.  The fix is in.  Somebody got the envelope.  What's wrong with the white man winning?  Nothing.  Nothing at all.  I say, because I hear that all the time, it's like, oh, what do we want to go back  to?  Just another old white guy in the White House. 
[02:35:00]  White men have fucking done an amazing job with the United States of America from the  inception of this country up until four years ago.  And not.  They've done both.  Look, look.  No, they've done both.  Exactly.  They've been amazingly wonderful and shit at the same time.  The greatest country on the face of the earth.  I'll give you that.  We've done some of the most amazing things ever in the history of humankind with a white  man at the helm of this country.  What's so fucking bad about it?  Nothing.  I love white people.  Isn't that Howard Stern's guy? 
[02:35:30]  Amazing.  Hello, white people.  What's that got me on the claim?  Yeah, yeah.  And I think Quiet Riot said it best.  What's that?  Is it Come On, Feel the Noise?  No.  Which one?  Yes.  Oh, bang your head.  Hey, man, let a helpful drive, you man.  I'm like Norton.  They did say it best.  Girls rock, you boys.  Come on, feel the noise.  Wait, who am I thinking of?  White man, come on.  Run to the hills. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, that's Iron Maiden.  Oh, nice.  Crossed the sea.  Norton's on fire.  Brought us pain and misery.  Norton's on fire.  Took our pride.  Took our creed.  Yeah.  Took our game for his own need.  There you go.  That's what I'm talking about.  That's pretty damn good, John.  Thank you.  Yes, when it comes to fucking mid-80s metal songs.  You're the savant.  Absolutely.  When it comes to getting a deal with a network, not so good.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Zero.  Yeah.  By the way, we didn't even.  Scorpions go to you every time.  We didn't request this, but level one has been achieved. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, wow.  They thought that was Jocktober.  No, it wasn't Jocktober.  That was like real, real life.  I love Jocktober, by the way.  Oh, you want to do Jocktober?  I was here last Jocktober.  We got one if you want to.  I was here last Jocktober.  I was not exposed to it until you, one year ago, it's our anniversary of I never knew  anything.  And I actually, this is no, I pissed myself laughing.  Someone says you have a Ku Klux Klan story, though.  I do.  Well, yeah, that's in my act.  But, you know, it's five minutes long. 
[02:37:00]  Do you really want me to tell this?  Oh, it's a bit.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, it's a bit.  It's a story.  Is it based on a real story, though?  It totally is.  Absolutely.  No, no.  When I was in high school, I had a black friend who snatched a Klan guy's hood off his head,  and he still has a hood to this day.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Exactly.  Wow.  That's a good story.  Where were they when it happened?  Yeah, you could tell the story.  We were on our way to a KISS concert in 1979 in Birmingham, Alabama, and we pulled over  at an exit to get some beers, and then there was a Klan rally going on on the corner of 
[02:37:30]  the side of the house in Odenville, Alabama, O-D-E-N, O-D-E-N, St. Clair County, Odenville,  Alabama.  All right.  And we got out, and one of my friends who was black was in the car with us, and he looks  over and sees.  They had buckets.  They had buckets for a charity, like in the South, you'll have a, it usually goes for  the police department, the fire department, cancer society.  Donate some cash.  They're all out there in their Klan shit with KKK on the buckets, and they're trying to get  people to donate money to the Klan. 
[02:38:00]  And no shit.  No one was giving them any money, and people were pretty much flipping cigarette butts.  But how many people, hold on, hold on.  No one was giving them money, but how many people wanted to give them money?  No, it looked angry and weird.  I think people were itching.  I thought they were probably thinking about it.  I'm sure there was somebody thinking about it.  There's too many eyes on me right now.  Exactly.  Exactly.  You know, but we pull over, and we look over, and my black friend, Scoop Jackson, Chris Jackson,  was in the car with us, and he looks over, and he sees the Klan guys, and he looks at  the rest of them, and he's like, I've got to have one of those hats. 
[02:38:30]  I've got to have one of those hats.  He called it a hat.  A hat.  I've got to have one of those hats.  And so we were in a silver Trans Am, the Smokey and the Bandit edition.  Ah, nice.  White trash squared.  And so we had the T-tops, and we had the T-tops out, and I told him, scrunch down, and  I'll hang on to you where you won't fall out of the car.  Oh, imagine who fell out right there.  And we were right there.  Exactly.  Damn, they deliver here.  And so we pulled up next to him, and my one friend reached over to drop the dollar in 
[02:39:00]  the bucket to get the guy near the car, and he popped up and grabbed the hood, and we snatched  it off his head and pulled it right on the interstate and took it to high school.  It's in the yearbook.  It's in the yearbook.  We took a Klan hood to school in Alabama, and we were passing the fuck around like the  Stanley Cup because we won it.  It was a legitimate prize to us, but the teachers and the faculty don't know that.  They just know it's Alabama, and there's a Klan hood at school.  And they didn't mind.  No, they called me.  I had it with me.  We were calling around, and I've told it in my act, but I'm like, I was sitting in  class.  I'll never forget.  Mr. Henley, come to the office and bring the hood. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, wow.  Right.  Exactly.  Did it have good workmanship?  No, it was actually kind of shitty.  It was shitty.  Somebody wasn't good with their sewing machine.  Yes.  Someone was not good with it.  They didn't have Norma Ray.  They didn't have a stitch.  They were too angry to stitch properly.  That was what I used to say in my show.  On the bucket, they had KKK, and it was like crooked.  I'm like, they didn't have a stencil for their hatred.  They had to freehand the racism.  Wow.  That's so totally true. 
[02:40:00]  But you got a bootleg version of my act right there.  No.  I apologize.  A story's a story, man.  That's a good one.  Oh, I got a jigging of those.  Jesus Christ.  I got fired from the judge.  Me and Rogel were talking about this.  The judge at the height of their judddom, Naomi and Winona, and I was working for them  at Caesars Palace, and they came down to my dressing room, and they were like, we hear  you're saying JC in your show.  And I'm like a jackass.  I'm like, I don't have any jokes about the JC's in my show.  And she's like, no, no, no. 
[02:40:30]  Naomi goes, Jesus Christ.  And I go, because if you whisper, he can't hear you.  And she was fucking livid.  She got really angry.  Hit me on the leg.  She goes, take it out of your show right now.  And so I only had one more show to do, and I decided immediately, I'm going to get fired.  I'm going to go rock out of here.  Good for you, Vic Kelly.  Well, I can go on stage.  I'll get paid.  It's in my contract.  Jim knows.  We go on stage, we get paid.  So I go out and talk about eating buttholes and every horrible, nasty vagina, blood fart thing  that I can think of and say. 
[02:41:00]  And they came out.  Normally, they would go on stage after that and open the show.  And they would come out from each side of the stage and meet at the microphones, and  they would sing a duet.  They brought the house lights up and apologized for me.  They came out and apologized for me.  Wait, so you changed your act for that final show?  Oh, totally.  I deliberately decided to get fired.  Because when they hired you, you were like, all right, I know what to do here.  I didn't give a shit.  But after that whole thing went down, you're like, well, I'm going to show you what I  can really do.  Exactly.  Nice.  So, no, I didn't care.  I was young.  Is there a tip of that?  No, God, no. 
[02:41:30]  And so I called Greg Rogel, who Jim knows.  He's brilliantly funny.  And I knew he was doing Westbury Music Fair with them out on Long Island.  And I'm like, hey, listen to what I just did.  They're a bunch of...  He goes, well, fuck, I'm opening for them.  I'm a Jew.  They'll hate me.  They're Christians.  He goes, I bet you I can get fired worse than you can.  And I'm like, what do you mean?  And he's like, just trust me.  And so three or three weeks go by.  He does the show.  He calls me at home.  And he goes, all right.  They walked out.  They apologized exactly like they did for you.  They apologized.  They said, we have no idea.  We didn't hire him. 
[02:42:00]  And he goes, but then they had a moment of silence and a prayer for my soul.  Come on.  He goes, you just got fired.  I got a moment of silence and a prayer for my soul.  I fucking won.  I'm like, you totally did.  What did he say?  He just talked about, I'm a Christ killer and every kind of horrible Christian.  Why would they want comics before they went on?  They usually don't check.  You know, a lot of times if they'll turn it over to the venue and they'll just say, get  a musician, get a comic, do whatever you want, you know, and you just get hired for whatever. 
[02:42:30]  I've been opening for a lot of people.  Like, we didn't even know you were a comedian.  And that way they don't like, if he's hired by the venue, they don't have to pay for his  hotel or travel.  Like the venue will take care of it.  Right.  Correct.  No, no.  Totally.  Well, he's in the business.  He knows this stuff.  A little bit.  Just a slight.  Just a red pubic hair.  Vic was looking at you like, wow, that's great.  How do you know that?  Well, Vic is probably looking at me going, Jim, you've never opened.  That's what I was thinking, actually.  Sometimes I don't know who my opener is. 
[02:43:00]  I'm trying to do your last appearance on the Opie and Anthony show, sir.  No, I know.  You want to do Jack-tober?  We were going to cut it off.  Please do.  No, no, please do.  It felt bad that we made you wait, and then we're thinking maybe we just blow off Jack-tober.  But if you're a Jack-tober type guy.  If it could top the thing you did, you know, the last time I was here, it fucking was  Who did we kill last time?  Somebody, and I thought it was fake, and they were bringing in somebody with a fake thing,  and they had a fake voice, and then Jim started doing it.  It was like, you guys knew everything the shitty hacks were about to do before they did it. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, right, yeah, yeah.  Sorry, do you know, this fucking Siri on the iPhone just picked up our chat and almost sent  it through to somebody in a text?  No way.  I'm not going to interrupt you, but this is how, with the iPhone will ruin relationships.  Oh, shit.  I'll read.  This is what it says.  You know, I got a gigolo, Jesus Christ.  I got fired from the judge.  Me, Unroh, get over.  Talk about this load like the judge of Bajat of their Judom Naomi. 
[02:44:00]  I'm Winona, and I was working from a Caesar's Palace and lately came down to my dressing room  and that we hear your things a senior show, and I'm like a jackass on my iPhone, and he  jumped by the J.C.'s amulet, and she's like, Mononoke Naomi cannot go.  Siri's having a bertation.  If you whispered picking up and she was fucking livid, chat, really angry, it relations, to 
[02:44:30]  get unusual right now, and so I'll have one more show to do, and I decided immediately  I'm going to fire.  I'm going Aroka.  Wow, you got the Honey Boo Boo filter on.  Absolutely.  That's really good.  The Honey Boo Boo filter.  That's that fucking Siri.  I guarantee you, someone has gotten...  You just happened to push Siri in the middle of that?  I didn't even know it, and it didn't send, but like, thank God we were just talking, but  you imagine if you were in a fucking thing?  Oh my God.  Hey, I got to be careful.  My wife's going to find out.  Oh boy.  Only if we have a little sponge fucking your wife.  Yeah.  Bubba, Bubba.  Were you listening to that one?  I totally have.  What the fuck else am I going to do? 
[02:45:00]  What else am I going to do?  What's your take on that guy?  I don't know.  He's kind of dirty, isn't he?  I don't...  You know, he's an idiot.  That's all I know.  Fair enough.  You know, if I can do your job, then I think you're an idiot.  So that's...  I have a low bar.  Holy fucking, just letting Hulk fuck his wife is the weirdest thing.  It's the craziest, bizarre...  It's just something fucked up in your head if you're just...  I don't know.  Right, exactly.  Sanctity of my marriage.  He's from Florida.  He's from Florida.  That's what you get.  You're from fucking Florida. 
[02:45:30]  It's the craziest...  I'm far like E-Rock.  Yeah, E-Rock's from Florida.  Is he really?  He went to school there.  He's a goddamn Florida Gator?  Yeah.  He is not a fucking Florida Gator.  Well, he's a Florida Gaylord.  That's a fake.  Florida Gainer.  Absolutely.  Thank you, Norton.  Nothing worse than a goddamn Florida Gator.  He gets mad because he wants people to think he was from Long Island.  Florida plays Georgia every year in the biggest cocktail party ever is what they call it.  And every year, I hope that the fucking earthquake happens and just sucks the whole stadium down into the bow of the hill. 
[02:46:00]  You really hate them, huh?  I don't like either one of them.  So that would be a combo platter of delight for me.  If you could fucking kill 90,000 idiots.  You like Auburn?  I'm an Auburn man, and they're going to be horrible this year.  My brother played at Auburn.  He was an All-American running back.  You learned that last time.  You go to games there?  I go once a year, and it's a sad, sad year this year.  They're going to win two ballgames.  Vandy's going to beat them this week.  That's how bad Auburn is.  Are they worse than Penn State?  Yes.  Oh, way worse.  That's impossible.  Penn State doesn't have players.  Do you hear what happened at Penn State? 
[02:46:30]  There was a little upset.  Wait, Penn State won this year already?  They've won three.  They've absolutely won three.  Didn't they lose a bunch of their players, though?  No, they lost their number one running back and their kicker, and then most of them stayed.  Most of them stayed?  Most of them stayed.  Why would you do that?  Well, because they want to show solidarity for child molestation.  So they decided to stay.  And they play kick and they'll shine there.  They're pro, right.  They think they're going to do really.  But they've won three, absolutely.  They beat Northwestern.  Northwestern was undefeated and ranked, and they beat Northwestern like two weeks ago. 
[02:47:00]  They're like three and three, I think.  I think they're three and three.  I'm not really sure.  Somebody could check that.  We could do Jocktober, Vic Henley.  Please do Jocktober.  I'd love to hear Jocktober.  Sam, you want to do Jocktober?  More than you know.  I see we're going to Canada again.  Fucking Robert.  See, this is where it started last time.  This is where it started last time.  It's the chip voice.  We're going to go to the Breakfast Club.  We're not playing the intro?  Oh.  All right.  Don't be lazy. 
[02:47:30]  Go all out.  Please go all out.  Sure.  Oh, I don't want it half-assed.  He wasn't going to play it.  No, you're right.  No, he stinks.  He's still grieving.  He's still mad.  He's a Florida game.  Well, he's sad.  Two of his heroes are fighting.  I heard him talking.  He did not want to talk to you about it, too.  It was really funny.  It was really, really funny.  He's like, I don't want to talk about my mom having sex.  Basically, it was that.  I know.  He'd rather film it.  Play the music.  It's Jocktober.  A celebration of all things shitty in radio. 
[02:48:00]  That's not very nice.  Fantastic failures of pontificating proportions.  That's so bad.  Wow.  An interactive exploration of what makes radio rancid.  Jocktober.  O-M-T.  Holes, bits, and stunt boys.  This isn't funny.  It's time for Jocktober.  And today, we're going to focus on C-103 Breakfast Club.  One of these breakfast clubs in New Brunswick, Canada. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  The Morning Zoo.  It's a rock station, though.  What's their slogan?  Do they feed your need for rock?  Wake up to the wackiest morning crew in Moncton.  Oh, no.  What's that?  See?  Oh, no.  Look at that.  See, they're nuts because they're what?  They're holding different types of nuts.  It's Ernie.  See, they're nuts.  No, they're nuts.  They're crazy.  They're wacky.  It's Ernie.  They're naked, but they're covering up their genitals.  It's Ernie, Mandy, and Tater.  Tater? 
[02:49:00]  Tater.  Ah, Tater.  Oh, no.  That's Tater.  That's not good.  What do we got?  The typical Ernie's, the vet.  You got the radio veteran.  You got the Tater, who looks a little old to be the guy that's a little edgy.  The logo is an interstate sign.  Yep.  Right.  So it's really...  That's terrific.  Yeah, these guys are real country.  And the dumb girl.  And I'll tell you this.  Every now and then...  We call her the hole.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  Every once in a while.  Nice.  Ernie and Tater.  I love learning things.  They get a little...  I mean, it's all in good fun.  Uh-huh.  Every now and then, Ernie and Tater might get carried away. 
[02:49:30]  Thank God Mandy is there.  Oh, it's a real man.  It's a real man.  Thank goodness.  Is this tape going to focus on the hole a little bit there, Sam?  Oh, boy.  Well, we'll watch all of them perform in their different ways.  No.  You know.  This is too good.  Okay, how do you guys lick your eggs?  I'm a hard-boiled kind of gal.  You're hard-boiled?  And Tater, well, you have scrambled eggs most every morning, I guess.  I like scrambled eggs.  Well, just because you do them in the microwave.  Do you do them...  When you don't do them in the microwave, you scramble them?  Scrambled, baby.  Really? 
[02:50:00]  Always scrambled.  Always scrambled.  Apparently, how you like your eggs can tell a lot about your personality traits, lifestyle  choices, even sexual preferences.  All right.  Okay.  So Mandy likes it hard.  That's right.  Hard-boiled.  Are they really doing this?  Yeah.  And of course, Tater, you're scrambled in the head, so of course, scrambled eggs.  I'm, unfortunately, soft-boiled.  Oh, get it?  My cock doesn't get hard.  Oh, Tater, now.  Oh, come on.  Settle down.  Guys, now. 
[02:50:30]  That's enough.  Oh, get it.  This bit.  I love the Canadian accent, though.  Yeah.  It adds a new element.  It really does.  We've been working on our accents for a while.  How do you like your eggs?  And she says, on a tampon, being fucking pushed out of me.  Oh, nice.  Preferences.  All right.  Okay.  What's it say about scrambled?  Yes.  Scrambled eggs.  Well, first of all, I like mine sunny-side up. 
[02:51:00]  Deep-fried.  Basically, a bacon fat.  About an inch of bacon fat.  I think he feels bad that no one asked him how he likes his eggs.  He had to jump in.  He had to tell him.  Guys, just because I'm setting up the bit doesn't mean I can't be involved, too.  You think they had a meeting after the show?  You know, guys, that whole bit there, you never asked me how I like my eggs.  Don't forget, we're all the fun guy here.  Right, man.  What the fuck?  Yeah, I had to, you know, I had to just throw in sunny-side up there.  Nobody helped me at all, eh? 
[02:51:30]  Why wouldn't you say, hey, how do you like your eggs?  And I'd go, you know, sunny-side up.  Yeah.  And then there's a joke.  Then there's a joke after that.  We left a joke on the table.  I had a punchline there.  The last thing we want to do is leave a joke on the table.  No, we can't leave any jokes on the table.  Don't leave it hanging like that.  Yeah, I was going to say something like, well, you know how I am.  I cover up my yolks, and you were going to...  Oh, you betcha.  Thank you.  Jocktober's back.  There you go.  I feel it.  Jocktober.  Today's working so far.  Is the energy in the room?  Oh, yeah.  Come on, guys.  Well, first of all, I like mine sunny-side up. 
[02:52:00]  It's fried, basically, in bacon fat.  In about an inch of bacon fat.  How great would it be if one of them said, oh, go fuck your mother?  It's a good-natured show.  Oh, and you're like, you're like, sunny-side up.  Oh, go fuck your mother.  Now one person's commenting about how he likes his eggs.  You know what I'm saying?  They hate him.  So he keeps going and going and going.  Just trying to get a little reaction.  Hey, what's going on?  Maybe just some pictures I found on the C-103 Breakfast Club's Facebook page. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, they dumped in.  Why did they do that?  I have four photos with Kiss.  I didn't even realize they knew you.  Peter Criss, top left.  Gene Simmons, top right.  H. Freely, bottom left.  And the bottom right is Paul Stanley.  And yet, all of them look like Terry Schiavo's face.  Paul put Terry Schiavo on there.  That's good.  That's good.  That's really good.  You haven't seen that yet?  That's been going around for a while.  No, that's a good one.  I have never seen that.  I only bought the H. Freely. 
[02:53:00]  Why would that be on their website, sir?  I don't know.  They got weird fans.  It's like one fan just posted a picture, and on one side of it, it's got a picture of  Bubba the Love Sponge, and under it, it goes, fuck my wife.  And then there's a picture of Hulk Hogan, and an ellipsis, and then, okay, with an exclamation  point.  Right.  But I don't understand why their fans would be posting that.  Maybe they were talking about it earlier.  Their fans are better than their show, maybe?  Maybe.  I don't know.  I don't know.  If they got Norton on, then they're better than their show. 
[02:53:30]  No.  Bad radio.  Unabashed Norton plug.  This might be their catchphrase, then.  Bad radio.  Black cocks and felching for the morning drive.  I don't know.  Their fan posted it.  Hey, like mine, sunny side up.  Deep fried.  Deep fried.  Basically in bacon fat.  About an inch of bacon fat.  You've had my deep fried eggs.  I've had your deep fried eggs before.  Very good.  They are good.  I've had your artery clogging eggs before.  They're wonderful.  She's hilarious.  Anyway, okay, hard boiled, Mandy, hard boiled eggs. 
[02:54:00]  You're disorganized and most likely to get divorced.  Oh.  Oops.  Sorry.  Sorry.  I'm disorganized.  I'm like, yeah.  And most likely to get divorced.  Heading right into a marriage.  I'm not even married yet.  Are you sure you're not referencing pickled eggs?  Pickled eggs.  I know what that means.  Pickled eggs.  Because she's infertile.  And he's saying that her womb is filled with pickled eggs.  What happened there?  No life can take form there.  What happened there?  Limited life.  Well, just when you thought the bit was kind of going nowhere and they were about to hit 
[02:54:30]  a wall, either Tater or whatever the other guy's name is, jumped in and said, you sure  you weren't talking about pickled eggs and hit that punchline.  Nailed it.  There we go.  He nailed it.  Pickled eggs.  You're back.  That's funny.  A U-turn to hilarity.  Oh, yeah.  Exactly right.  They teach you in radio school that you got to hit them hard with a nice punchline and  then those lasers got to kick in.  I did a show in Memphis once and they admitted to me off the air that they had gone to morning 
[02:55:00]  radio boot camp.  That there was some kind of, that there was some sort of school and they had just gotten  back.  And I didn't even know that existed.  And I was just sitting there and they were like, ha, ha, ha.  We just got back from, yeah, we went to Omaha and we learned.  They all get together, drink a lot, fuck each other, and exchange ideas.  It's ridiculous.  One idea.  One idea.  They exchange the same idea round and round and round.  Is it fun radio boot camp?  They've been trying to get us to go there forever.  For what reason?  To learn what not to do? 
[02:55:30]  They want us to be on panels and shit.  Okay, somebody on their Facebook.  There's a tree on my house.  I'm pushing a picture.  It looks like a dick.  Of an old lady with a tree on top of her house.  Well, on her house.  And then two dicks in the lawn.  Well, sure.  That's yard sculpture.  She couldn't get the flamingos, so she went with the cock.  Now, why are the C103 fans posting pictures of a lady with a tree on her house?  Because I have a tree on my house. 
[02:56:00]  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  Now you're doing Dane Cook.  Yeah, yeah.  In your face!  It's because it's in your face!  That's the lovely, talented Scott Shannon.  One of their fans.  All right, all right, all right.  Yeah.  It's in your face!  It's because it's on your face!  One of their fans.  Oh, wow.  More.  Named Jerry Sheppardini.  Oh.  Is posting more pictures of trees on people's houses and then adding dicks into the phone. 
[02:56:30]  These are black ones, too.  Those are black.  These are turgid black cocks.  Yeah.  Let's continue with the egg talk, people, as we continue with Jack Tolber.  Yeah, back to the...  See, and I want you to realize, there's two ways that this bit could go.  Because we're talking about the way your eggs translate to your sexual styles.  Right.  The bit has potential.  Let's be honest with each other.  Let's all be honest.  Let's see if they take the right road.  Now, you could talk about some of the different...  Ever the optimist. 
[02:57:00]  Some of the...  You have to protect my fellow radio people.  He's always negative.  You're always positive.  That's right.  I'm a very positive...  That's how it goes.  Boy.  Although, I'm more positive lately for the opster.  Oh, sure.  For the opster.  Trying to get that viral video.  They could talk about the dirty, nasty, sexual things.  Right.  Or they could shift and more focus on eggs.  And the way you prepare them.  Oh, God.  They blew it.  They blew it.  No, I'm not saying which one they did.  It's just...  We're a fork in the road. 
[02:57:30]  We're a fork in the road.  That's right, Vic.  That's exactly right.  We're a fork in the road.  I'll bet you one of them said, I like sunny side eggs, but splashed all over my tailbone.  I believe Norton.  I'm always with Norton on the prediction.  He did the voice last October before the voice came into the vids.  I like them to be splashed out of a black pepper holder.  Why wouldn't you take the naughty road?  Well, I don't know.  Hard-boiled?  We know what that means, Mandy.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, you've got it.  Yes.  Not really saying it, but saying it. 
[02:58:00]  I found a hard-boiled egg in my breast.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  It's nice.  Oh, my God.  That's just not right.  I like it.  That's not right.  Hey, it's October.  It's October.  It's Breast Cancer Awareness Month.  Oh, shit.  He's wearing pink while he did that joke.  He's wearing pink while he did that joke.  You know, I've got to say, I love the Geico commercials with the two guys on the stage with the fucking Jimmy and Ronnie.  Oh, it's terrific.  It really is a terrific spot.  I don't know, Jimmy.  How about you, Ronnie? 
[02:58:30]  Ding, ding, ding.  The Vox does infuriating.  It's terrific.  You guys don't understand comedy.  I'm happier than Eddie Money owning the travel agency.  Ding, ding, ding.  How about you, Ronnie?  I don't know, Jimmy.  I kind of like it.  They set up the stage on a beach.  Unbelievable.  Anytime you get a mandolin in, it's always good.  Why is there a picture of Fat E-Rock on that?  Where's that from?  I don't know.  It's on the C-103.  This is on the Canadian.  He's still sticking with their website.  Breakfast Club Facebook page, and there's a picture of Fat E-Rock holding his titties. 
[02:59:00]  Let's do this.  Let's continue with the egg to the eggs.  Remember that fun little trick when you had to take the shell off?  Yeah.  So I've been doing this.  Blowing on the egg?  Yes.  It works every time.  Okay, so explain to people how you do.  What do you do?  Is that a hard-boiled egg?  You smack the fat in, and then you peel off the top end.  Just a little bit off the top.  You blow it.  It blows right out.  It blows right out of the old shell. 
[02:59:30]  And the whole shell comes off in one.  When it's cooked or when it's raw?  When it's cooked.  How ridiculous.  No, we used to do that when they're raw.  We used to put a pin and a hole in the end of it when you're painting eggs for Easter, you know?  Yeah, to get rid of the yolk, yeah.  Same, yeah.  Now try it raw.  Well, it works raw.  What the fuck is going on?  They actually went to eggs.  Rocky Balboa over it.  Why is it already?  Well, they're cracking themselves up.  That's wacky, Hillary.  Yeah.  Is that a point about eggs, Opie? 
[03:00:00]  Cracking?  You got it.  You got it.  Thank you.  You got it.  Thank you.  He didn't even realize.  I don't even realize how I'm brilliant sometimes.  He didn't even realize.  Thank you.  I got an egg joke.  I love whites.  What?  Oh, hey.  We covered that earlier.  Yeah.  There's racism in there.  That's right.  Yeah.  Did they just talk about eggs?  Mitt Romney.  Yeah, they were talking about ways to peel hard-boiled eggs.  No edge or jokes.  They just kept it literal.  Smack the heart in.  They said smack the heart in.  Well, did you hear how she said she likes it?  She's like, I like to peel it by inserting it into my vagina, and then I like a mule to kick 
[03:00:30]  me in the cervix, and the egg falls out.  He's on fire today.  Why is the mule on fire?  I think I bring out the best in Norton every time I come in.  She was a tired boy.  It had to be a mule.  Can't be a donkey.  Because it's such a horrible animal to kick you in the fucking cervix.  It really would kick hard like a mule.  Your eggs would be all cold by the time it decided to kick you, and it would keep missing. 
[03:01:00]  Dumb mule.  Well, apparently, one of their fans, their listeners, because I'm at the C-103 Breakfast  Club Facebook page.  Which we didn't tell anyone to go there.  I don't think, yeah.  No, I think it's their listeners.  Because one of them is, I guess, a fan of the Opster, because there's a message that says  the Opster strikes again, and it's a video of a no-look basketball trick shot, which is  just taking over YouTube.  It really is.  Well, you know, those Canadians, they know their quality.  This is one of my real videos.  Seriously?  It's an amazing shot. 
[03:01:30]  At this point, it's the number one trick shot video on YouTube, I would think.  I think so.  Really?  And then there's a picture of Clint Eastwood next to a chair, but then it's a Photoshop  of E-Rock and Troy looking like a gay couple with a can of boy butter on the chair.  Boy butter.  Boy butter.  Right.  And pastels.  Very nice pastel jacket.  Troy is wearing a baby blue blazer while Eric chose pink.  Pastel pink.  Salmon.  Salmon.  It's salmon.  It's salmon in the gay community. 
[03:02:00]  It's lovely.  Coral.  It's coral or salmon.  Yeah.  You know.  Well, these guys.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Now we've got a dead woman.  I don't know why the dead woman.  It's a dead black woman in a casket.  A picture of a corpse on their page.  There's one cousin Dave on Facebook is suggesting, please have some respect for yourselves and  stop doing radio.  Nice.  I think this makes them sad.  A picture of Terry Clifford.  That's lovely.  That's really good.  When do we get Terry Clifford? 
[03:02:30]  I got to make you wait a little bit.  I like the Hitler in the background.  Yeah.  I love the Hitler doll in the background.  The baby, the baby, the little baby Jesus Hitler.  The little baby Jesus Hitler.  Let's do this.  C-103 Breakfast Club.  They talk about the Hulk Hogan sex tape.  We talked about the Hulk Hogan sex tape.  They talk about the Hulk Hogan sex tape.  Nice.  Yeah.  And I want to point out to you guys how it's supposed to be done.  All right.  But now come to find out at the end of the tape, Bubba comes back into the room with  the wife and says, hey, if we want to retire, we just got to sell this tape. 
[03:03:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  So was he like, did he set up the camera for this and was he videotaping it, Bubba?  No, it was a security camera that they had in their bedroom.  Like he wasn't, no, he wasn't in a peephole.  Right.  He was actually in his office doing work.  Doing work.  Who has a security camera in their bedroom?  Look at me.  Well, that's good because I was going to ask what Emily later on today, buddy.  Oh, too far.  Maybe too far?  There she is.  What else were you going to add there? 
[03:03:30]  Too far.  Oh, and she goes, what else are you going to add there?  Let's move on.  Oh, Christ.  Why would you do radio in a broad?  Why would you do that to yourself?  That's just the worst, man.  Too far.  Too far.  Too far.  Too far.  He's got to reel him in.  Well, that was one of the guys suggesting sex with his co-host wife.  So that's a little far.  Too much.  I come too far.  Too far.  Yeah.  I come.  I ain't always tired.  I'm no ways tired.  We come too far.  Does that make you uncomfortable? 
[03:04:00]  I hate when Hillary did that.  When she talked black?  She tried to sound black.  She's trying to relate to the people.  I ain't come too far.  Do we have that, Iraq?  He's fine.  Iraq.  Comment.  Very uncomfortable.  Yes.  That would be like if one of you guys suggested having sex with my wife, which, I mean, it  would be totally over the line.  That would never happen.  No, it wouldn't.  You're married.  I am.  You like women?  What?  Oh, man.  Well, it's true.  Oh, now.  Thank you.  Hey, hey, hey. 
[03:04:30]  Calm down, now.  Hey, now.  A little fire, Vic.  Come on.  I have it if you want.  Is there more?  Is there more of this?  Play the beginning.  You're on.  I don't feel no ways tired.  I come too far from where I started from.  Nobody told me that the road would be easy.  I don't believe he brought me this far to leave me.  God, is she awful. 
[03:05:00]  That's wonderful.  That's so fucking good.  That's so good.  She's like a black robot.  It's really good.  That's really amazing.  She's getting into the spirit of what she's reading.  Right, correct.  It's pretty obvious to me.  I don't feel no ways tired.  Yo, danger.  She's.  We've come too far.  It's Faulkner-esque.  It really is, yeah.  Hello, Joshua.  It's Faulkner-esque.  Would y'all like to play a game? 
[03:05:30]  I've always relied on the kindness of strangers.  A robot.  Halfway through phase one.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Photos no longer allowed on their wall.  Oh, why?  I don't know.  I guess their fans are getting crazy.  One of their fans just wrote, stage two is my favorite.  Now you have to make hard decisions.  That's one of their fans, I don't know.  Thank God there are fans.  No, that's really good.  I wouldn't want to deal with that shit.  Oof.  They continue talking about the Hulk Hogan sex tape on the C-103 Breakfast Club in Brunswick, 
[03:06:00]  Canada.  Somewhere in New Brunswick, Canada.  Yeah.  It's old tape.  Yeah.  Did you watch it, really?  Yeah.  Just not the naughty bits.  I wasn't interested in the naughty bits.  Not the naughty bits.  Because he uses his wrestler voice, too, when he's in the bedroom.  I think I'm going to incorporate that.  Be Macho Man instead, though.  Ooh, Webley.  Yeah, Webley.  Ooh, Webley.  I can't even go there. 
[03:06:30]  Maybe she'd do that.  Well, of course.  Why would you go there?  We call it sleeper hole.  Figure four leg lock.  I think they did some wrestling impressions there.  They were pretty good, too.  You liked them?  Yeah.  I kind of did.  I guess there's a request line on their Facebook page, because there is a request from one  of the people on their Facebook wall.  Yeah.  It says, please spontaneously combust.  Cerebral hemorrhage.  That's the request line.  Can't somebody get a cerebral hemorrhage? 
[03:07:00]  No punchlines had been sent.  Somebody, before they shut down the pictures, Eric just sent this to me.  Somebody left that on their Facebook page.  That's Robert Shaw.  Right.  We're going to need a bigger tree.  We're going to need a bigger tree.  On my house.  Yeah.  Where the hell is New Brunswick?  Where is that?  Like Vancouver is?  I don't know.  It's Moncton.  Moncton is in New Brunswick, though.  Moncton, right?  Oh.  Moncton.  Moncton.  Moncton. 
[03:07:30]  We come to our final clip here.  Oh, man.  It's a real shame, huh?  It really is, Sam.  Women don't find cooking sexy, and Ernie got a frying pan on sale, which is apparently  funny.  Ernie!  Yeah.  Talk about sex and everything, and then Ernie's like, oh, let me turn this around and talk  to you about the price I paid for a frying pan the other day.  Well, that's logical.  And fun.  A little fun for the radio.  Yeah.  Shoot to Thrill, ACDC on C103. 
[03:08:00]  Good morning.  Morning.  It's Breakfast Club.  Some clouds today.  Drizzle to showers coming in this afternoon.  A lot of rain overnight tonight.  13 for the high today.  Right now we're at six.  Weather for Irving.  Six.  Save up to nine cents a liter at Irving.  Don't have to do weather on the radio.  How many times do we have to tell you people?  Look out the window.  Holy fuck.  Stop.  Look out the window.  Holy fuck.  You know what year you live in?  82.  It's 1982 in Canada.  It still is.  Reagan's alive. 
[03:08:30]  Yes.  Hello.  Save up to nine cents a liter at Irving when you shop at Sobeys.  92% of women want a guy who can cook.  We really like it when you guys cook press.  Yes, I understand that.  After 26 years.  Indeed, I do.  Of course, I bet.  Did I say, though?  Yeah.  It doesn't matter.  There's one.  My wife's an invalid.  I have to cook for her.  She can't do anything but lay there like a turnip, and I'll fart right in her mouth.  They posted a picture of the guy jumping off the spaceship doing the space jump. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  And it says, I must go.  My planet needs me.  They thought that was like a little fun thing they posted on their Facebook.  And the comment is, we don't need you.  It's okay.  There are thousands of radio shows completely identical to this one.  Morning Zoo.  They were going for a little bit of fun there.  The wacky.  Their listeners, I guess, didn't like it as much.  I understand that.  After 26 years.  Indeed, I do.  Yeah.  They say, though, you might find this surprising because we always thought that if a man cooks  for us or can cook that it's very sexy, but women don't necessarily think that a man is 
[03:09:30]  manly or sexy when he cooks, they say 71% says they more of us think it's just thoughtful.  Unless, of course, he's cooking hot dogs and forcing them into my vagina and anus.  But I think it's sexy.  If he's making kielbasa.  I was going to say kielbasa.  I knew there was a kielbasa joke coming.  And he's palm pushing it into my asshole.  I knew there was a kielbasa.  The idea of just the flat palm. 
[03:10:00]  Palm pushing kielbasa.  Right.  Get it off my taint.  Get the kielbasa off my taint.  Because the hot dogs you can take, but the kielbasa is too thick.  You can't handle.  You can't handle.  And you got to fucking, you got to palm push it.  Not even nice with two fingers.  No.  Nothing gentle.  Flat.  Nothing gentle.  Nothing gentle.  Just cram it in.  Just cram it right in.  Now.  Now.  Hey, hey, hey.  Now.  Oh, now.  Too far. 
[03:10:30]  That's what she says when her asshole closes around the sausage.  And it's now inside.  This is strange.  One of their listeners.  Maybe this is an inside joke of theirs.  Just wrote.  They wrote, B-I.  L-L-T.  E-T-L-E-Y.  Bill Tetley.  Bill Tetley.  Bill Tetley.  I don't know what that means.  That traitor.  He loves that show too, huh?  I guess.  In fact.  Bill Tetley.  Bill Tetley.  They more of us think it's just thoughtful. 
[03:11:00]  You haven't seen me cook before.  I got my kiss the cook apron on.  That's it.  Ew.  My kiss the cook.  They spelled it wrong, dummy.  That's probably not what I was supposed to say, but he filled in the fucking back half  of that second hole.  It's actually a kiss.  It has all the members of kiss on it.  It's a kiss the cook.  It was supposed to be kiss the cock and his dumb wife put on the wrong one.  Some fucking old Nazi memorabilia. 
[03:11:30]  You know the kiss the cook that has the dildo attached to it?  Have you seen that one?  It's a horrible joke.  There's that where they have the kiss the cook and it has the dildo where you pull up  the apron.  It has a little thing across the front.  It's got a dildo attached to it.  You're like, hey, kiss the cook.  And then he raises up the thing and the dick pops out.  Hilarious.  Hilarious.  That is kind of funny.  It's funny.  Hilarious.  You like it.  Yeah.  Dahmer had the same fucking aprons.  Yeah, exactly.  The same apron.  Right.  Murder my meal and then kiss the cook.  This was real.  Rape the Loatian boy. 
[03:12:00]  That's it, baby.  Are you still spitting in the frying pan?  I am.  She's in bed.  She doesn't know that yet.  You've got to find out what's hot.  Well, actually, you don't have to do that anymore because I've got a real good frying  pan.  Why don't you spit in the frying pan?  What is that?  T-fall?  Color code.  It's like a $70 frying pan.  You spent that for that?  No, it was on sale for $30.  She smuggled it out in her pussy.  That's how we got it.  I didn't spend $70 clams.  I didn't spend $70 of these rubber dollars we have. 
[03:12:30]  These fucking Super Bowl money we have.  Right.  With this fucking old dyke's face on.  You didn't spend $70 bouncy clams.  Fucking shitty rubber money.  No one's counterfeiting that fucking Monopoly money, you assholes.  It's plastic now.  Of course it is.  Why wouldn't it be?  It's fucked up what it looks like.  That's good.  Rubik's money.  If the lead singer from Rush is on your currency, you might be a Canadian. 
[03:13:00]  You might be a Canadian.  You might be a Canadian.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Just in the nick of time, I have an announcement to make.  Oh, yes.  All right.  Face for complete.  Ah, there it is.  Their Facebook is no longer available.  Why?  Why would they shut down their Facebook during their show?  That I don't understand.  Too much wackiness ensued.  I guess so.  This is too much crazy.  You don't know what's going on in there. 
[03:13:30]  Maybe they're stunting.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  They're off the hook.  They're off the leash.  They're running wild.  They don't know what's going on.  Their Facebook page is gone.  That's too bad.  I kind of enjoyed some of their little photos and stuff they were posting.  I enjoyed the yard dicks.  You liked that?  Yeah, the yard cock.  That was really good.  There was a tree on that.  Can't get enough yard cock in the whole thing.  That's a bummer.  We were just having fun, too.  That's too bad.  Kenley, you're going to have to come back because your appearance was a little short today.  Whatever, boys.  Anytime.  I'm at the Goobies in Baltimore this week. 
[03:14:00]  That's the only reason I came down here.  The Goobies in Baltimore.  Actually, a very good room.  Yeah, I knew that.  I knew Jim would.  Yeah, exactly.  No, it's a great gig.  And Vic is a funny man.  Vic Henley on the Twitter there.  I've written a whole new show.  Come see me.  Oh, nice.  No.  Eight minutes.  I got a new eight minutes.  It's going to be really good.  It's all about Paula Deen.  We'll check our calendar.  We'll get you back in soon.  No, no.  Thanks, boys.  I feel like you should have stayed here a little longer than you.  It doesn't.  You know, I'm a FOS.  Jim Norton's got a new CD out.  It looks terrific, man.  I know a lot of these bits on the back, and they're really good. 
[03:14:30]  Thank you.  It's on iTunes for pre-order release dates December 11th.  It's a wonderful Christmas gift.  It's called No Baby for You.  And please be offended.  My hour special is now on Netflix.  And this Friday, I'm at Club Madrid in Vegas.  And then Helium Comedy Club in Philly.  My first comedy club dates ever in Philly.  Also a good gig, though.  Really good gig.  I've heard it's an amazing club.  A late show Thursday and a Sunday show has been added.  Early show Thursday and the weekend is all sold out. 
[03:15:00]  So that's the only availability.  And that's it.  All right.  I guess we're going to leave today.  Oh, in Toronto, November 9th.  I'm going up to Toronto to do the Dark Comedy Festival.  Maybe you can get the C-103 crew to come down.  Believe me, I'm worried about that.  You'll bully us, eh?  Yeah, we don't have to deal with these idiots.  Our pals, they walk into these shows and get killed.  We've heard from a few of our comic friends.  Oh, yeah.  It blew up my spot. 
[03:15:30]  I can no longer do radio.  Right.  I don't know.  I like that, though.  I don't mind that.  Fine.  Yeah, I can't do good morning dating.  Fine.  Yeah.  Damn it.  I'm okay with that.  Guys, fuck me.  Yeah, you killed me.  I can't do it.  You're killing me here.  You're killing me.  I can't do Des Moines anymore.  You know what I'd like to let everybody know?  That dish.  What happened?  I love that.  Dish has been all over the news lately on how their whole home HD DVR, the Hopper,  allows people to skip commercials. 
[03:16:00]  The Hopper.  Yes.  What's not to love about that?  The L.A. Times even did an online survey, and three-quarters of the Americans that were  surveyed said they'd actually pay extra money to be able to skip commercials.  No big surprise there.  Here's how it works.  Dish Auto Hop simply lets you skip over the ads in many other primetime HD shows.  No fast voting.  No picking up your remote.  You barely have to do anything, which is kind of what TV's all about in the first place.  All you have to do is call 1-800-WATCH-TV and sign up.  And you'll be doing that auto-hop thing. 
[03:16:30]  Watch TV shows, and you won't have to sit through those damn commercials.  What's not to like?  The major news networks.  The major networks.  Not even news networks.  Just the networks.  They might not be too crazy about it, but then who cares about what they think?  If you hate wasting time watching commercials, you need to get this.  Call 1-800-WATCH-TV to find out more.  1-800-WATCH-TV.  Dish, let's watch TV.  Thank you, Vic Henley.  Thanks, boys.  See you tomorrow.  The Opie and Anthony Show is pretty much over. 
[03:17:00]  This show will be available later today with SiriusXM On Demand.  After ONA Live is next.  This show will be available later today with SiriusXM On Demand. </pre>
