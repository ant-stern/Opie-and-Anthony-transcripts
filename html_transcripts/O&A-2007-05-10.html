<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts and Jim Norton engaging in self-deprecating humor about their own offensive language and mean-spiritedness.  A significant portion focused on baseball, specifically Roger Clemens' return to the Yankees and Ricky Henderson's stinginess with foul balls.  They also discussed Curt Schilling's apology for his comments about Barry Bonds.  The conversation then shifted to political correctness, using a Hamas Mickey Mouse ripoff children's show and its subsequent cancellation as a jumping-off point.  This led to a discussion of Don Imus, the pornographic film made in response to his controversial remarks, and perceived hypocrisy in reactions to offensive statements made by different figures, including Al Sharpton and D.L. Hughley.  Jim Norton provided an enthusiastic review of a Joan Rivers performance, highlighting her uncensored comedy.  The hosts then dissected and mocked a listener-submitted audio remix of Alec Baldwin and David Hasselhoff created by "Floyd the dump guy" from Detroit.  They briefly mentioned upcoming guests Dr. Ian Smith and Larry the Cable Guy, and Anthony’s workout routine.  Throughout this opening segment, the hosts employed frequent profanity and sexually suggestive and offensive humor.

The show continued with a discussion of comedian Albrecht's leave from HBO following an alleged altercation with his girlfriend.  Speculation about his relapse into drinking after 13 years of sobriety followed.  The conversation then turned to the hosts’ and a guest’s experiences with Pilates and yoga, featuring humorous anecdotes about awkward moments and flatulence. A video clip of a man butchering "Amazing Grace" was played, prompting further laughter and commentary.  The segment also included a story about a yoga instructor who unexpectedly stripped shirtless in class.

Larry the Cable Guy then joined the show in studio.  Their conversation covered his career, fanbase, political correctness in comedy, and the pressures faced by comedians regarding potentially offensive material.  He shared anecdotes from his early career, including cold-calling radio stations.  The hosts and Larry discussed their experiences with different audiences and the challenges of maintaining relatability.  They touched on various celebrities, including Al Gore, Sheryl Crow, and Ron White, often using humor and offensive language.  A significant portion of the discussion centered on the censorship of Larry's Asian-stereotype jokes, which the hosts found incredibly frustrating and ironic. The segment concluded with Larry promoting his new movie, *Delta Farce*.

The next segment focused heavily on the show's censorship frustrations.  The hosts detailed several instances where material was deemed unacceptable, despite their belief that it was not offensive or violated FCC regulations.  Specifically, they discussed the censorship of Larry the Cable Guy's Asian-themed jokes, Homeless Charlie’s use of racial slurs (including the n-word) and antisemitic remarks (despite his graphic descriptions of mugging elderly women remaining uncensored), and the arbitrary nature of censorship, citing the censorship of the seemingly innocuous word "Poo-ha" in some regions and the accidental creation of Morse code for another offensive word through bleeping.  Homeless Charlie, a recurring guest, was a major focus, sharing his shocking anecdotes.  Dr. Ian Smith, a guest from Celebrity Fit Club, also participated, mostly commenting on E-Rock's weight.  The segment included further crude humor, including a discussion about an article linking oral sex to throat cancer.

A weight-loss bet involving a segment guest, "E-Rock" (Iraq), formed the basis of the following segment.  Opie offered E-Rock $500 to lose 20 pounds in seven weeks, with failure resulting in a $100 penalty.  E-Rock's weight, possessions (including a remarkably large wallet), and unusually yellow armpit stains were subjects of much mockery.  A caller, "Pete," raised the stakes by adding the condition that E-Rock would have to appear on stage in his underwear if he failed.  Dr. Ian Smith, author of "Extreme Fat Smash Diet," was present, offering weight-loss advice and his book.  The conversation then veered wildly, touching on Dr. Smith's experiences on Celebrity Fit Club; Jimmy's frequent urination; a YouTube video of a "ghetto booty"; and Michael Strahan's divorce.  The segment ended with arrangements for follow-up weigh-ins.

The final segment began with an unclear exchange, followed by a discussion of Pat from Munaki, a competitive eater who consumed 72-73 double shots of eggnog, with graphic footage of his subsequent vomiting. This led to a discussion of a scientific experiment involving flies.  Pat Duffy, who participated in the eggnog contest as an intern, was also discussed; his vomiting video, "Baby Bird," was described as a viral sensation.  A caller named Pat detailed his relationship woes, including "hate sex" with his ex-girlfriend, who he claimed left him for a fighter jet pilot (a claim later questioned). His father also called in.  Dr. Ian Smith offered commentary and “advice.”  A call with an Air National Guard member helped clarify inconsistencies in Pat's story.  Dr. Smith promoted his book and offered to modify his diet plan for truckers.  The conversation returned to Pat from Munaki's weight problems.  The final portion included banter with E-Rock and discussion about the show's performance and upcoming renovations, ending with further discussion of E-Rock's stained undershirt and off-color jokes before the show signed off.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM 202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  What? What is this?  Garbage!  You know what? I can't take this anymore.  It's an awful, awful radio show.  We're really, really mean-spirited, evil people who can't see the good in anything.  Off the air, let's say racist things to each other.  Hold on, hold on.  And really turn them off. 
[00:00:30]  Excellence in broadcasting.  Our anus.  What? Again?  Oh, oh.  Our anus.  What? Stop, enough about the anus.  Ah, this is hurtful.  This is hurtful. No one wants to hear this on their radio show.  Some collapse on our floor.  It's just potty mouth day.  You may feel shame, but all the same, you're one of my knees in pain. 
[00:01:00]  Opie.  Anthony.  Shish.  Jim Norton.  You guys ready to laugh?  It's got to be the greatest thing ever.  I'd sooner have a water drinking contest.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you all.  Well, they came and got me out of Texas.  And I can tell you it's a privilege to be back.  I'll be talking to you all soon.  Roger Clemens is in Georgia's box.  And Roger Clemens is coming back.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Of all the dramatic things. 
[00:02:00]  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  Roger Clemens standing right in George Steinbrenner's box.  Announcing he is back.  Roger Clemens is a New York Yankee.  And there we go, John.  You don't have to worry about who's going to take that spot in the rotation.  You should see what's going on in the Yankee dugout.  Big grin on Jorge Posada's face.  Andy Pettit knew.  Big size. 
[00:02:30]  Roger Clemens is now a Yankee.  Attention fans.  He is here.  And now we don't have to discuss who takes that place in the rotation.  Was it kids' day at Yankee Stadium?  Oh, no, no, no.  Roger Clemens is in Georgia's box.  Roger Clemens is in Georgia's box.  In the box?  Is he?  And Boston just yawns.  They're like, whatever.  You can have him.  He's 46 years old.  I just think that was a great bit of broadcasting there. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Could be the most annoying voice ever.  Yeah, Susan Wallman.  She actually does a pretty good job as far as announcing the Yankee games.  But, I don't know, she kind of lost it there a little bit.  Yeah.  A little too much excitement.  A little bit.  A little bit, a little bit.  Hey, we were talking about Ricky Henderson yesterday.  Good morning, by the way.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  And Ricky Henderson now wants to get back into baseball because Roger Clemens did, 
[00:03:30]  and he just refuses to retire.  He's been trying to play for the last four or five years,  and a team will pick him up for like a week, a two-week run, a month run.  And then he plays in the minor leagues.  He just doesn't want to give up on this thing.  Doesn't want to leave the game.  He's 48 years old, right?  And we were just talking about him yesterday,  and there's an article in the paper today.  I don't have all the details yet because we're just getting started,  but he caught a foul ball at a baseball game.  Ricky Henderson, who's like what, the steel leader, right? 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  He's a legend.  He always wanted to catch a foul ball at a baseball game,  so he catches this thing, right?  He's right next to a kid.  And the thing to do when you catch a ball, obviously, at a baseball game  or you get a puck in the stands at a hockey game,  you look around.  If there's an old fella next to you, you do the right thing.  You hand it over, right?  Well, there was this kid right next to Ricky Henderson, you know,  with those big eyes hoping and wanting that he's going to get the foul ball 
[00:04:30]  that Ricky Henderson caught in the stands.  Ricky Henderson refused to give it to the little kid.  Well, yeah, he should have, like, signed it and then given it to the kid.  Thanks, Travis.  I just saw this before we came in today.  Henderson, who caught a foul ball on Monday at AT&T Park  where he was watching the Mets play the Giants,  kept the ball instead of handing it to a young old fan.  A little lad.  Everybody was asking me for the ball, Henderson said Tuesday. 
[00:05:00]  I said, you're not getting this ball.  I always want to get a foul ball.  This one's going on a shelf at home.  Well, you know, something good for him.  You think?  Yeah, he could probably sell it.  He's got enough stuff in his trophy case, though.  He's got actual, like, bases, you know, that he stole.  He's got him.  He's got him, right.  It's a little twisted.  It's twisted. 
[00:05:30]  The young fan didn't go home empty-handed, though,  as Henderson signed another ball the fan already had.  Another ball, though.  No, you've got to hand over the foul ball, also sign it,  and give the little fan a picture.  Henderson joked that his catch in the stands shows he's still got the skills  to play the game, so he's still at that.  Showing him I still got good hands.  The ball found me.  I was so quick.  Well, he's trying to sell himself based on catching a foul ball.  Yeah, yeah.  Look at me.  Look at me.  Look.  All right, can we put you in the stands? 
[00:06:00]  Put him in a uniform and put him on the stands to catch foul balls.  That is hilarious.  Let's say hi to Boston.  Jim listening on WBCN.  Jim, what's going on today?  Hello, Jim from Boston.  Right.  That's you.  Hi.  Yes.  Okay, I didn't know you were talking to me.  Hey, you can keep Roger, and you can keep that sea monster announcer  that was announcing for him, too.  Sea monster.  Oh, yeah.  That was a terrible way to wake up in the morning.  You have to have a warning before you have those things.  Yeah, you guys don't really care about the Clemson thing, right? 
[00:06:30]  No, we got Beckett.  Yeah, you guys.  We got Ice-K.  We got Beckett.  We got Schilling.  We got a whole rotation.  We could probably sell some to the Yankees.  Speaking of Schilling, I guess we're doing a little baseball right off the top of the show here.  Schilling apologized for his Barry Bonds comments.  Why?  Everyone has to apologize now.  Why?  We're an apologetic nation.  Disgusting.  Nation.  Yeah, Curt Schilling had some harsh things to say about Barry Bonds,  saying he cheated on his taxes, cheated on his wife, cheated on steroids, 
[00:07:00]  cheated on this, cheated blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  It was a great quote.  I loved it.  Yeah.  But today, in the Boston Papers, you know, it's all over the place that Curt Schilling  has issued an apology.  Not just to Bonds.  Oh, to Bonds' friends.  His friends, family, acquaintances.  Minister.  People that have seen him play ball.  Right.  The guy that gives him his Starbucks every morning.  You know.  Everyone is just so apologetic.  We're just so jittery in this country. 
[00:07:30]  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Why don't we just say sorry off the bat here?  I just want a blanket apology.  I'm going to say sorry because I know I'm going to say something just horrific today.  So before it happens, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry for put something here.  That's all.  Now you can just put it in.  There you go.  You got my apology now.  You know, everyone is so panicky that even Hamas. 
[00:08:00]  Hamas.  Did you guys see this?  Hamas is politically correct now.  Well, that whole Mickey Mouse thing.  They had this Mickey Mouse ripoff.  Yeah.  That was on this kid's show.  Yeah.  This Hamas kid's show.  And all it was doing is talking about death to America, hatred toward the West, Allah,  and teaching kids how they should just use weapons against their enemies, which, of course, are us.  And doing it in, you know, kid fashion, a little kiddie show fashion. 
[00:08:30]  And it was a blatant ripoff of Mickey Mouse.  I wouldn't say blatant.  It was pretty awful.  I mean, they thought.  Yeah, but you knew it was supposed to be Mickey.  Yeah, of course.  It was bad Mickey.  But.  Yeah, they thought they were accurate.  But here in America, we're laughing like, you guys are a bunch of hacks.  That almost looks like Mickey Mouse.  Yeah, it's sort of like Asian paintings of horses.  For some reason, I don't know why, but Asian paintings of horses stink. 
[00:09:00]  They don't look like horses.  Yeah.  They don't look like horses.  No, they don't.  They don't.  They don't.  Just a side note.  But I guess they were getting so much criticism that they fired the Mickey Mouse ripoff.  They took it off the air?  Yeah.  Why?  Did Reverend Al Sharpton threaten all sorts of things?  And Hamas panicked?  Yeah.  The advertisers pulled out, which was all like C4 companies.  Explosives.  And fuse makers.  And hollow-bottomed shoes incorporated. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  I'd like to apologize for dressing in the mouse suit.  That was you, Mr. Iman.  Saying those off.  I needed a gig.  Yeah.  I thought it was safe because I was in a mouse suit.  Yeah.  And it was inappropriate to say, and I apologize.  It was stupid.  What are you doing now?  Now?  Yeah, now that you can't do that. 
[00:10:00]  Touching children at a Chuck E. Cheese.  What else is he?  What else is Iman's doing?  Iman's is relaxing.  Yes.  Good for him.  Have fun.  So, Hamas got rid of the Mickey Mouse ripoff thing that we were talking about yesterday.  Speaking of Imus, there's a porn out that we can't even know.  Imus is doing pornography?  Opie, are you the first one breaking this news?  You know Hinkley and everybody else is going to pick this up.  My God.  Opie just announced Don Imus is doing pornography. 
[00:10:30]  Wow.  How the mighty have fallen.  Why don't we ask Mr. Imus, are you doing a porn or what?  Yeah.  Yeah?  What's the name of your porn?  I can't say it, or the Opie and Anthony show will be off the air.  Yo, yo, yo.  We can't even say the name of the porn, but the porn industry, God bless them.  They're quick.  And they don't care.  They could get these things out quickly, too.  And there's a porn that is titled Exactly What Imus Said.  Wait a minute.  If we say that, they'll dump it? 
[00:11:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You can't even say it anymore.  You can't say it.  Mm-hmm.  Not even as reporting it as a story.  Everyone knows what he said.  Everyone knows it was about a certain type of hairstyle and a certain sexual promiscuity.  Mm-hmm.  And that's what the title of the movie is.  Yeah.  The porn industry has put it out, and it features women that have that exact hairstyle.  Right.  Doing horrific things. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Where's Reverend Al Sharpton?  I think that's much more damaging to the black community and black women.  Has anyone ever had to apologize from the porn industry?  Except, I'm sorry, I tested positive.  Pretty much it.  Like, what else is there to apologize for?  They've gotten the most horrific thing.  Yeah.  The titles are just horrific.  No, they're great.  I love them.  They're a bit hacky.  But I mean, as far as the PC police go, oh, just talk about some racism and sexism. 
[00:12:00]  I saw the cover of the porn, and it's all women that have this hairstyle, just in horrific  positions, doing some very interesting things.  And then they have on the cover a radio microphone with the shockwaves coming out of it.  Oh, really?  Like a shock job?  And then I think it says something like, shocking, shocking.  Oh, that's good.  Where's the Reverend Al Sharpton?  I'm outraged.  Where is he?  He should be outraged.  That's more damaging.  Why don't you go after that? 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  Come on.  It's demeaning women.  Big time.  They didn't try, like, everything.  They didn't dump everything on the cover.  Like, put a basketball on the cover, just to get that kind of aspect of it.  I don't know.  A big Reverend Al-looking look-alike.  I don't know.  We're going to have to get a copy.  We're going to have to review it for this radio show.  They should have taken a little more time.  Gotten a Reverend Al-look-alike, kind of an Imus-look-alike.  Mm-hmm.  And basketball, a women's basketball team. 
[00:13:00]  Mm-hmm.  Look-alike.  Uniforms.  Yeah.  And have them all go at it.  Yeah.  Wouldn't that be funny to see, like, the Imus character just going at it, and he's tagged  out by Reverend Al, who kind of gives him the, uh-uh-uh, and then he's done, and the  Reverend Al character just goes to town.  I want to see Rob Bartlett dressed as, uh, what's his name there?  Brian Wilson.  Brian Wilson, yeah.  In the porno with that Hawaiian shirt.  I think that's great that they have the microphone with the lightning coming out of it. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, something like that.  That's the universal, like, shock jock.  Yeah.  Kind of logo.  Mm-hmm.  And then the Reverend Al, a lot of controversy over him.  We're just like, look at us just sagging in and out of all sorts of things as we start  the show today.  Reverend Al's, uh, like we, well, like we have a target on our back.  Oh, before I, uh, yeah, sorry about that.  Speaking of, uh, what we can't say.  Yeah.  And the porno is titled this.  Yeah.  The thing that Imus said that got him fired watching Idol last night, and man, they throw 
[00:14:00]  that word around like it's nothing.  Yeah.  The other N-word.  It's like the other white meat.  It's the other N-word.  Well, because I think the other N-word was the real problem, not the other word that  was used in that statement.  Ho?  You could say ho, probably.  Although that was bad, too.  If you can't say nappy in a regular discussion, then we are finished as a society.  Yeah, not even a radio show or anything else.  As a society.  We are finished.  If you can't, even like a real conversation, if you can't say that, we are done. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, it's ridiculous.  Done.  Yeah.  Well, with that said, on American Idol, they took a look back at the finalists, and they're,  and, I don't know, they're growing up stages, showing little baby pictures and stuff.  And this was said.  I thought I was cute.  I had nappy bro when I was a baby, really little nappy bro.  All right.  That's her describing her hair?  Yeah.  And a lot of women of that color describe their hair in that way. 
[00:15:00]  You know, there are too many people overthinking this.  There really are too many people overthinking this to the point of severe paranoia.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Wait, wait.  They getting, she got flack for that or no?  No.  No.  It's just, you know, it doesn't matter.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter because she said it.  It doesn't matter that D.L. Hughley said that Imus was absolutely right, calling the  women's team that because they are that. 
[00:15:30]  I mean, he said that on Leno, and there's no outrage because he's the right color.  Right.  God bless D.L. Hughley for being completely honest on Leno's show to the point where Leno  was like, oh, my God, I'm, oh, my God, they're coming after me now just because I had you  on my show.  Everyone is just in a complete panic.  So, yeah, Reverend Al Sharpton, what's the latest on this thing there, Ant?  Well, apparently he's in a little bit of a jam.  He said a few things about the Mormon religion when he was talking to, who the hell was he 
[00:16:00]  talking to?  Or about?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he said some stuff about the Mormon religion that could have been considered maybe, not racist.  What would you call that?  Religionist?  Yeah.  A Mormon phobic?  Anti-Mormon-nick-ish?  Anti-Mormon-ascetic?  I don't know what you call some of these things anymore. 
[00:16:30]  Well, here's a story in case you haven't heard yet.  Comments by the Reverend Al Sharpton struck a nerve among many Utahns and Mitt Romney supporters.  During a debate, Sharpton said, those of us who believe in God will defeat Republican Mitt  Romney for the White House.  Sharpton made the comments in a debate Monday with atheist author Christopher Hitchens.  Sharpton said, as for the Mormon running for office, those who really believe in God will  defeat him anyways.  So don't worry about that.  That's a temporary situation.  All right. 
[00:17:00]  So he's saying that Mormons don't really believe in God.  Was that it?  I suppose.  And watch how there's no real fallout.  No.  Watch how he'll apologize.  He'll say he's sorry.  He will apologize.  Will he?  Yeah, yeah.  No, actually, he'll backpedal.  Yeah.  Well, we heard a lot of ham-a-ham-a-ham-a-ham-a-ham-a-ham-a from him yesterday.  He was trying to explain himself.  Explain what he meant.  Well, we got Sharpton here.  The Romney campaign had a quick response.  It is terribly disheartening and disappointing to hear Reverend Sharpton offer such appalling 
[00:17:30]  comments about a fellow American's faith, the spokesman said.  America is a nation of many faiths and common values, and bigotry toward anyone because of  their beliefs is unacceptable.  Sharpton, who recently campaigned to get radio talk show host Don Imus fired for making racially  insensitive remarks, denied he was questioning Romney's belief in God.  Rather, he said he was contrasting himself with author Christopher Hitchens.  Mormons, he said, by definition believe in God, but they don't believe in God the way 
[00:18:00]  I do.  Huh?  What?  What?  Who?  That is one of the worst explanations.  Listen to his comment.  He said that Mormon, he specifically called him out.  He wasn't comparing his own religion to an atheist's religion.  That's backpedaling.  That's total backpedaling.  Nothing will happen to him.  No, of course not.  Nothing, because white people run everything. 
[00:18:30]  White people fire Imus and white people will not punish Sharpton.  Yeah, why would they?  And as for the one Mormon running for office, those that really believe in God will defeat  him anyway.  So don't worry about that.  That's a temporary, that's a temporary situation.  See, he gets some laughs.  Why is he allowed to say anything he wants?  He is completely wrong there.  He's completely wrong.  And his excuse for it is a lie.  It's Reverend Al being what he is.  A liar and a self-promoting jackass with no credibility that somehow got this credibility. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, it got the ball rolling as far as, you know, this climate we're now in.  The Romney camp said, f*** that.  Can we beep?  Ow.  And Sharpton scrambles here to explain what he really meant.  And what I said was, I didn't even say really believe, I said really believe in God. 
[00:19:30]  Because I don't believe you can really believe in God if you think God created some inferior  to others.  I believe that.  And as a minister, I have a right to advocate.  That's not bigotry.  That is really saying, I don't believe God is a bigotry.  Oh, my God.  That is one of the worst explanations ever.  He's saying he was quite, I don't even, what?  He's saying that the Mormons somehow believe, apparently, I don't know anything about Mormons,  that some people, God created some people inferior to others.  Inferior to others.  But that seems to be Reverend Al's interpretation of what they believe. 
[00:20:00]  Because what this shows me is Reverend Al is playing the race card here.  He's saying that, I'm just saying that they say some people are inferior to others, and  well, I don't believe in that.  You say, I don't believe God is a bigot.  No, maybe that's what you're finally saying.  But the bottom line is, you're smashing their religion.  Yeah.  What do you think Jews and Christians, or Christians and Muslims have been going at it?  They don't look at God the same way, silly.  Right.  That's exactly it. 
[00:20:30]  So don't make it look like you're not bashing someone's religion.  And this is a guy who's in a debate with Mitt Romney.  Yeah.  Imus was just a guy on a radio show.  This is a guy, and Mitt Romney should be spit on for debating him to begin with.  Exactly.  Why would you debate him?  Anyone that gives this guy the time of day.  Stop giving this guy credibility.  Unless it's us.  If he wants to come on our show, we'd have him in a second.  Just to tell him the time.  Right.  I'm Reverend Al.  All right.  We're just getting warmed up here.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:21:00]  Who do we got coming in today?  We got Dr. Ian Smith.  He's going to talk about Celebrity Fit Club.  It's a pretty good one this year.  And Larry the Cable Guy.  Oh, nice.  He's coming in.  And Jimmy walked in all just blurry-eyed this morning, and just like a zombie, talking about  Joan Rivers or something.  I don't know.  You're going to explain next?  I will.  Were you bleary-eyed?  Yeah.  He was just babbling like, I'm a bleary-eyed ass.  He's just so much better than everybody out there.  Oh, and you hear it?  It's amazing.  Yeah, Jimmy works for you. 
[00:21:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and Live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio, starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.

That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Don't forget the power of the... 
[00:22:00]  We got into that at the end of the show yesterday, and a bunch of people were standing by with  stories, Anthony.  The power.  The power of the...  Yes, ladies, we're talking about you and what you got that we want.  And we'll do some outrageous things to get it.  What we'll do for it.  We'll keep it.  We'll wear a Yankee hat, even though we are the starring quarterback for the Patriots. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  That's the power of the...  Little Jimmy Norton in studio.  He's playing Carolines starting tonight, right?  Tonight through Sunday.  Oh, tonight.  I'm going to try to be there tomorrow night, man.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-1-0 for tickets for Jim Norton at Carolines all weekend long here in New  York City.  Now, you walked in, Jimmy, all like just...  I don't know.  I'm overtired.  I've only slept for about an hour, but that had nothing to do with it earlier. 
[00:23:00]  But I went with my girlfriend last night.  She went to see Joan Rivers.  And I had wanted to see her because I met her once and she was very nice to me.  Get a picture?  I did in the airport, yeah.  When I met her, yeah.  She's played in the cutting room here in New York.  She does it like every Wednesday or every other Wednesday.  She has a really weird schedule.  It seats about 100 people, and it's like a little room she obviously likes to do.  And I could not believe how good she was.  Really?  It's one of the funniest performances I've ever seen a comic give. 
[00:23:30]  And I mean, I am not exaggerating.  She walked up.  She did about an hour and five or an hour and ten.  She didn't sit.  She didn't sip water.  She was a machine, topical.  You name a taboo subject, and she brutalized it.  Really?  You've never seen a more brutal comic.  Never.  Joan Rivers.  They were appalled, the people.  And yet they loved her.  But I talked about 9-11.  Everything awful you can talk about, she hit and hit as hard as I've ever hit it. 
[00:24:00]  And getting big laughs for it, right?  Amazingly funny.  There was not one cheap joke.  There were great jokes.  I mean, she's just – it was like everyone talks about Borat.  And if not, it was funny.  Yeah, I know.  With the ass in the face.  Ugh.  That was what a comic should do.  I almost cried.  My girlfriend felt the same way.  It was like, you're watching an absolute artist.  Wow, are you gushing?  Dude, it was the art, especially with the way things are today, it was the art as it's meant to be.  Yeah. 
[00:24:30]  Just her standing there, obnoxious, vicious, really funny, really smart jokes.  I mean, she mentioned Fort Dix.  She mentioned the West Virginia.  Everything awful she did as she skewered as a comic.  Yeah.  I cannot stress enough how great she was.  The Muslims?  She got on the Muslims?  Yeah.  She just talked about how awful the women are.  And she just – she's so honest.  She talked about having her face done.  And she's 73.  She mentioned her husband's suicide.  You just – you cannot not love Joan Rivers. 
[00:25:00]  She was as great – I saw Rodney when he was like 80.  Remember we had him in in 2002?  Uh-huh.  And God bless Rodney.  He's one of the greats.  But he was on stage like, hey, you know.  And he was doing the same stuff he had done.  Not only was he doing the same stuff,  his wife was, you know, giving him lines.  Yeah.  From backstage.  He was a little older.  He was, you know, not the old Rodney anymore.  He was the old Rodney, yes.  Yeah.  But I guess she would feed him his lines from backstage.  But the material – his material hadn't changed.  Like, it was – even anything that might have been newer was still the same. 
[00:25:30]  Like, hey, I don't get no respect.  I forgot until this morning that she used to say, could we talk – she didn't say it  once last night.  F-bombs.  She dropped a C-bomb.  But I mean –  Nothing better than an old lady dropping a C-bomb.  An old Rod.  Oh, my God.  An old Rod.  She did a bit about her daughter being offered Playboy for $400,000.  And I wanted to – the only regret I had is my girlfriend, we wanted to stand for her  when she was done.  She deserved the standing ovation. 
[00:26:00]  But, like, as a comic, when I watch another comedian, I'm almost more low-key.  I never want to do anything to make me go, hi, notice me.  I'm almost like –  They'd notice me.  Right, right.  I'm embarrassed that I didn't stand up for her.  She was – I wanted to hug her through half the performance.  And you rarely watch other comics, by the way.  Nah, I'll watch in two minutes.  Most of them are atrocious.  But, I mean, some of them are great.  I just don't want to see them.  But I could not get over – she's at the cutting room if you're in town.  I just don't know when it is.  You have to look it up.  But I was literally speechless. 
[00:26:30]  Like, that's what it's like to go and watch a comedian.  Like, it was – everything I wanted to be was her.  It was amazing.  An old woman?  Yes.  I was had work done.  It was had work done, and apparently genitals have dropped.  I mean, I don't know if we can say that.  But it was as brutal as set as you've ever seen anybody do.  See, now I'm going to have to go see her.  I thought of you guys.  I'm like, it's funny.  I hate what she does on the red carpet.  Every once in a while, there's something that's really funny.  You should see the way she talks about these people.  How does she do it on the red carpet? 
[00:27:00]  If they heard five minutes of her act, they wouldn't let her within 20 miles of the place.  Maybe that's why she's doing that, like, 100 seat.  Anything she says can be made public.  Like, you know what I mean?  She's Joan Rivers.  A little under the radar, though, instead of doing these huge shows or these events.  You know, a lot of people get in trouble because they do these political fundraiser things,  and they get up on stage, like, Whoopi's done it, and she's gotten in trouble.  Rosie's gotten in trouble.  And they say one little off-color remark or a little criticism, and they just get pounded. 
[00:27:30]  And if she ever did that, she'd probably just be thrown out of the country.  Well, I think she's been attacked before by stuff she said.  I don't think she cares.  Like, you watch her.  She's not being phony, and she's not trying to be shocking or outrageous.  She's just being funny.  Yeah.  She's just funny, and I've never seen anybody more unapologetic about being funny.  Like, she just didn't.  She wasn't trying to hurt anybody's feelings, but there was no subject she didn't want to write about. 
[00:28:00]  Good.  And address, and it was like, you're like, that's what a comic should do.  And she's also at a point in her life where she has nothing to lose.  She doesn't care.  She doesn't care.  Very good.  She was.  Travis just sashayed in with a note.  Apparently, the cutting room, she is only there for the next two Wednesdays.  But, I mean, to go pay respects to just one of the greats ever, I could not get over.  I'm blown away.  Very good.  All right.  I just showed up.  I was just looking at the nude statue of Paris Hilton on the news. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, what is that?  I don't know.  Apparently, there's a nude statue of her, and they showed that without blurring anything out.  Because sometimes they blur things out in a statue, which I find hysterically funny.  Well, we're going to show you how ridiculous.  A piece of rock.  See?  There it is.  Look, you can see her statue boobies.  It doesn't even look like her, though.  She has boobies.  And she has Tinkerbell on her chest.  Yeah, her little dog.  She's going to jail for 45 days.  Arnie's not going to be able to help her.  No, he'd be screwed.  Mm-hmm.  It doesn't matter.  You know how bad that would look if he got that little rich ad? 
[00:29:00]  Rich.  Yeah, I know.  I couldn't think of the word.  Yeah, use C, P, or C.  Bitch.  I know what word you wanted to use.  I think it's a little excessive, to tell you the truth.  What?  Why?  I think her jail term is a little excessive.  Not only is it not excessive, Justin Volpe should check her in.  By the way, speaking of drunk driving and all that, well, she, suspended license in her case.  But she was caught under the influence, too, once, right?  Yeah, she had a dewey? 
[00:29:30]  I think so.  I'm not positive.  Huh?  I think that's why it was suspended.  Oh, okay.  That's why they suspended in the first place?  And then she drove with that?  Well, there was a record set as far as drinking and driving.  Listen to this.  A dubious distinction, a driver has broken Washington State's record for driving under  the influence.  What do you think the record is?  The new record.  Washington State.  What do you think, Jimmy?  Washington State.  Legal limit is just under that .10 or .8 is the legal limit, right? 
[00:30:00]  Or 1.0.  .08.  .08, .09, something like that.  It's just under .1.  I bet this person got a 1.1.  It's a new record.  1.1.  A new record.  A new record.  Let's say .08 is the line or whatever.  Don't you hate when people ruin guesses?  Like, what do you think the new record is?  300.7.  A dubious distinction, a driver has broken Washington State's record for driving under the influence. 
[00:30:30]  Police say Dina Jarrett had a blood alcohol level of .47.  Oh!  Six times the legal limit.  Worse yet, she's a former Seattle police officer.  She was arrested this week after crashing into two vehicles.  Only two?  That's not bad.  That's some good driving.  Man, that is something.  One was an ambulance and one was the space shuttle.  Oh, my God.  What an Alki.  .47.  Beat that.  That's hammered. 
[00:31:00]  That's going to be a tough one to beat.  That is hammered.  What is she, two feet tall?  You know, because small people get drunk faster.  Oh, wow.  Hold on.  Please hold.  Please hold.  And that one was just a pile up.  And then I rented a car to get home.  And I don't even have any commentary on that.  I've made an ass of myself.  Yeah.  Speaking of that, by the way, the remixes are coming in. 
[00:31:30]  Greatest ass ever.  Alec Baldwin remixes are coming in and Hasselhoff remixes coming in.  Yep.  The Hass.  The Hoff.  I call him the Hass.  Because he made an ass.  He's the Hoff.  He's the O.  Hmm?  The Off.  Well, you want to hear a couple of these?  They're all right.  Yeah, he was all hammered.  God bless our dump guy in Detroit.  He sent one in.  Did he?  Yeah.  He's rolling his eyes right now.  Oh, we got it. 
[00:32:00]  We got it.  What's his name?  Floyd?  Yeah, Floyd the dump guy in Detroit tried his hand at an Alec Baldwin remix with Hasselhoff.  We've told everybody the clips are out there.  If you want to whip something together and send it into the show, we'll play it.  Yeah.  Our own Danny pretty much got this ball rolling.  He sure did.  Can I make a point?  No one named Floyd has ever not sounded stupid.  I don't know Floyd the dump guy. 
[00:32:30]  I'm sure he does a good job.  I would imagine he likes the show.  He's a good boy.  I bet he's participating in the show.  He must like it.  I bet he dumped out of what Jimmy said.  Oh, no, he didn't.  He didn't know where the dump button was.  He's eating lead paint chips.  Floyd is...  No one has ever said, let me check with Dr. Floyd.  Ever.  I can only imagine that.  This has got to be just great for Detroit right now.  They're listening.  The dump guy Floyd.  He's responsible for dumping out.  And we can beat the crap out of him vocally, and he can't dump out. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Can't dump out of that.  God forbid we try to say something about a race or anything he'll dump out of, but we  can bash him.  Yeah.  Floyd.  I'm trying to think of anyone smart.  Who invented that?  Floyd.  Floyd the inventor.  Yeah.  The only time you'll ever hear that is who invented that.  Floyd.  What was it?  It's called the incest encourager.  Poor Floyd.  Yeah.  So, you want to hear a good one, or you want to hear a bad one, as far as the remixes 
[00:33:30]  go?  How many does Floyd send?  I mean, was it one or two?  No, we got a bunch from all over the country, but Floyd's definitely stands out.  Oh, no.  Do you want to hear Floyd's first?  I don't know.  I haven't heard it.  Was it?  Floyd was the name of Brad Pitt's character in True Romance.  It was all high.  Oh, really?  Yes.  I don't know, man.  What are you doing here?  He's a barber on Andy Griffith. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Floyd the barber.  Floyd the barber, and he was a dolt.  All right.  Well, why don't we play Floyd's?  He's the dump guy in Detroit.  This is his Haas, Alec Baldwin remix.  Are we going to have to guess if this is the good one or the bad one?  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm making a little contest.  Oh, boy.  It's going to be tough.  I don't know if the listeners are going to be able to figure this one out.  Poor Floyd is so burning hot right now.  He's sitting there all red and sweating, and everyone's coming in to laugh at him. 
[00:34:30]  You can tell Floyd works for a radio station because there's a lot of sound effects in this.  And it also makes me wonder why Detroit hasn't updated their sound effects library.  You want to know something you'll never hear ever?  Which one of the elements on the chart is that?  I don't know.  Let's ask Floyd.  Unless you're in a meth lab somewhere in Missouri.  See, Detroit's still getting to know us. 
[00:35:00]  I just want to say to Floyd the dump guy, this means that we like it.  Yeah, Floyd.  Don't worry.  You've got to understand how twisted we are on this radio.  I want to apologize to Floyd, Floyd's family, people that know Floyd, the button Floyd punches.  To all people with Down syndrome who should be named Floyd.  He thought he could send this in under the radar.  Just a quickie.  He's probably trying to get into radio.  Probably wants to, like, I don't know, get out of the dump room and do something real with his career. 
[00:35:30]  Do you think any dump guy just wants to stay a dump guy?  Figures this is a way to do it.  Sending something to the Opie and Anthony show.  All right, here's Floyd the dump guy in Detroit with his Alec Baldwin Hasselhoff remix.  It's very similar to Danny's that star this whole thing where they're talking to each other.  But then it takes an unusual twist at the end.  A strange, inexplicable twist. 
[00:36:00]  Right.  And maybe Floyd could call the show because we like to hear about the inspiration behind the piece.  Steve used to do this.  Steve would explain his production pieces in a way that would make us understand.  That's how we got Ramon and the other fine characters that Steve has come up with.  And for the listeners, when it starts to get really boring, just hang in there.  You're already prefacing it with that?  Poor Floyd.  Incidentally, three minutes ago, or three seconds ago, you said Floyd can call the show right now.  Someone is walking into the room going, why are you screaming Opie and Anthony out the window? 
[00:36:30]  Bird from Philly is already calling Floyd Stink Floyd.  Stink Floyd.  Comfortably dumb.  Bird in parentheses.  Dumb side of the goon.  In parentheses, he writes, I don't even need to hear it at this point.  Just call him Stink Floyd.  Stink Floyd.  Oh, my God. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, my God.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  Can I oil this?  What?  Oh, your mic stand is squeaking.  That's all right.  Don't worry about it.  We have big problems.  Don't worry.  You'll forget all about it once you hear Floyd.  Here's Floyd the dumb guy from Detroit.  I think we have to stop it.  Right there, we got to kind of stop and comment.  Yeah, we're going to take our time with this piece.  Floyd. 
[00:37:30]  Floyd the dumb guy.  You know, he went into the sound effects library.  Of course he did.  He needs a phone ringing because he's got the two guys talking on the phone with each other.  So he decided that a phone ring from 1962 would be perfect for this bit.  That's the same sound that Ruth Gordon made when she called Rosemary to ask if he could bring the devil's baby over.  He couldn't find some kind of cell phone ring. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, just use your own cell phone.  Yeah.  What ring do you use?  Actually, it would have been funny with some kind of stupid ring tone.  That's probably Floyd's real phone at home.  He just never updated it.  He's got the little dial on it.  I have to climb up the pole just to answer phone calls.  Floyd?  All right, here we go.  I'm tired of playing this game with you. 
[00:38:30]  What?  You have humiliated me for the last time.  What?  You do it to me constantly and over and over again.  You have insulted me for the last time.  Who said?  You don't have the brains or the decency as a human being.  I'll be fine.  I'm going to really make sure you get it.  F*** you, you're a good nightlife.  I am going to get on a plane, or I'm going to come out there for the day, and I'm going  to straighten your... 
[00:39:00]  By the way, just to help the listeners along, as you can tell if you're a faithful listener  of the program, this is very similar to Danny's.  It's actually exactly like Danny's.  Well, and that's why I stop it, because did you hear?  I'm going to get on a plane.  I think it'll help the bitter long.  All right.  We'll play that part again.  I'm going to get on a plane.  Right.  As we continue with Floyd the Dump Guy in Detroit's remix here.  Plane.  I didn't go back enough. 
[00:39:30]  Hold on.  Here we go.  I'm a good nightlife.  I am going to get on a plane, or I'm going to come out there for the day, and I'm going  to straighten your **** out when I see you.  Do you understand me?  I'm bull ****.  So you better be ready to meet with me.  I'm going to stop.  So I'm going to let you know just how I feel about what a rude little pig you really are.  You have humiliated me for the last time.  I'm bull ****.  I'm a young plane. 
[00:40:00]  This is a mess.  And then Floyd, to make sure you understand where he's going with this, just out of nowhere  at the end of it goes, getting on a plane.  He threw it in.  He clipped it out.  Plane.  Awkwardly.  Oh, listen to that part again.  I'm bull ****.  I'm a young plane.  He jams it in there with a sledgehammer.  Because there's no confidence in the fact that he's going to get Alec on a plane.  On a plane.  At the end of his remix here.  Yeah. 
[00:40:30]  So right at the end, once again.  Get on a plane.  You really hated me for the last time.  I'm bull ****.  I'm a young plane.  This is a mess.  Back to the sound effects library.  I'd like to say to Floyd, I understand it, but you don't have...  The trip to the airport can be edited out.  Why don't you have him going, where's my sweater?  It might be chilly.  Floyd, you forgot to have him packing. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  Suitcase sound effects.  Why don't you have Club Sonny Kenny calling?  I printed out the boarding passes.  Here's your itinerary, Alec.  So, Floyd's going to have fun with the sound effects library.  Yeah.  With the phrase, I'm getting on a plane.  So now he's going to visit David Hasselhoff somewhere in, what, Nevada, I think it was?  Oh, whatever.  This is a mess. 
[00:41:30]  There goes Alec.  Trade clear for takeoff.  3-2-0.  It's time to 15.  The plane's taking off.  That's an old...  Wow.  That's the plane that shot at Kong.  The first...  What...  What is that?  First you hear this modern air traffic control.  Yeah.  And then a crop duster goes by.  And a plane that Humphrey Bogart should be on.  A car he spit out of the driveway with would be faster than that plane. 
[00:42:00]  What are you doing?  We got Floyd on the line, but let's get through his pants first.  Just did a loop-de-loop.  Wait, he's got the same car?  Exactly.  You forgot the tram sound to get to the rental car place. 
[00:42:30]  I'm disappointed.  No baggage carousel?  Or a guy with a sign?  Yeah.  That says Alec?  I'm surprised he didn't insert the in-flight movie.  Flight's in real time.  I don't know why this one makes me laugh so hard.  What the hell is he doing? 
[00:43:00]  What's happening?  It's obvious what's happening.  He went to the airport.  He flew to wherever Hass is, Hasselhoff, and then he now drove to his house.  He's banging on the door.  Drives like a maniac, by the way.  It's always hard on the brakes and hard on the gas.  And obviously Hasselhoff is inside mixing another drink because he's hammered. 
[00:43:30]  A drink.  You heard the ice, didn't you?  And the liquid pouring, Jimmy?  Look, I'll go back.  Listen again.  Of course.  He arrived to the house.  He's walking up to the front door.  He's banging on the door as David Hasselhoff makes a drink.  David Hasselhoff lives in a vault.  I'll be fine. 
[00:44:00]  I'll be fine.  And that's how it ends.  And that's it.  What is the beep for?  If you had to beep it, why'd you put it in?  You didn't need it.  I don't know.  There's just a beep for no reason.  A man just went beep.  One more clip.  Yeah.  I made an ass of myself.  I'm sorry I did that.  I'm embarrassed that I did that.  So he bangs on the door.  Hasselhoff is making his drink.  Hasselhoff never gets up.  Alec finds his way into the place, walks. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, no, no, no.  He finally opens the door and blows him away.  We don't know who gets shot there.  No one knows.  Is it Hasselhoff?  Because then he says, I'm all right.  Yeah, if he just got blown away, why is he still talking?  But then I'm thinking maybe he shot Alec Baldwin because he knew Alec Baldwin was coming over all angry.  But he's too drunk to be that rational to have a gun ready and no Alec Baldwin.  Although he did hear Alec Baldwin say he's getting on a plane twice.  Holy Jesus Christ. 
[00:45:00]  And this is the beautiful part.  He's literal about the phone ring, the car to the airport, plane sound, car from the airport.  And yet Alec Baldwin is going to address another 50-year-old man in this clip.  He's literal about everything except for the fact that Alec is talking to another man and not his daughter.  Right.  Yeah.  It doesn't make sense.  None.  With that, we say hi to Floyd.  Floyd!  What's going on, guys?  My God, Floyd.  You know what?  I think I did my job on this one.  I got all you laughing at it. 
[00:45:30]  That was my intent.  If that was your intent, job well done.  Okay.  I don't think it was.  I was going to straighten it out for you.  Alec Baldwin shot David Hasselhoff.  David was kind of drunk, stumbled to the door, opened the door.  Alec shot him, but he's drunk, so he didn't feel the effect.  Oh, so he said, I'm all right, but obviously he's not.  Right.  How did Alec Baldwin get a gun on the plane?  I'm not sure.  He slipped through security somehow, so that's kind of the mystery in that one.  All right.  That kind of had me a little boggled, too, how he got the gun on the plane. 
[00:46:00]  No, I grabbed the audio for the Alec Baldwin clip on my way out the door and did this at home  and got the edited version, which I didn't find out, so I already got all the way to my house,  and had some pretty lame clips off some download site on the Internet,  so it wasn't done with the highest-grade equipment.  It sounded like you were holding two, like, just, like, Walkmans side-by-side.  I was like, you popped with a string together is what I was using.  Yeah, the sound effect's a bit on the old side, Floyd. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, old-school sound effect.  But, hey, I thought it was pretty funny.  It's like the old Foley engineers with coconuts and then a horse galloped.  Nice modern phone thing.  Should have gotten someone to go, Bensonhurst, three.  All right.  And you're on the dump button every day in Detroit, Floyd.  Yes, sir.  Right on, man.  How's Craig doing?  Craig's doing good.  We used to work with Craig here in New York.  He's a good man.  Yeah, he's a good guy.  I like him.  Yeah, I guess he's supporting the show. 
[00:47:00]  You know, we got a ways to go as far as Detroit goes, but we're very excited to be there.  Hey, I got your back, and I can't wait until you guys come in in August.  I'll be there for sure.  Oh, it's a great show.  Thank you, Floyd.  The ONH Traveling Virus Comedy Tour.  Yeah, it's making a stop in Detroit.  Tickets on sale through Ticketmaster.  It's going to be huge.  Hey, Floyd, send in more production pieces, please.  All right, you know what?  I'll do some good stuff here on one of my overnight shifts and send it in to you.  All right.  Yeah, do some good stuff.  All right, man.  All right.  All right, thanks, guys.  There goes Floyd, the dumb guy.  There goes Floyd.  You know, Floyd's confident. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, yeah.  He didn't get on and start stammering and stuttering.  He said, this is what I did.  That's it.  Yeah.  I like the confidence.  Didn't try to pass the buck or nothing.  No.  Well, here's the end of the clip again.  Now we understand why.  Now that we understand it.  He was too drunk to feel the gunshot one.  It's like one of those movies you have to watch a few times to get it.  And once in a while, I could use maybe you.  Oh, that's the Jerky Boys one.  That's all right as well.  Who did that one?  Ah, whatever.  Forget it.  Who did the Jerky Boys one?  I don't know.  It's topical. 
[00:48:00]  It's it.  I know.  Jesus.  That's another kind of bad one.  15 years old.  All right.  We'll take a break.  I'll cut your belly open.  Wasn't that available?  Red.  That would kind of be funny, though.  Of course it would be.  I'll cut Z's in your cheeks.  After the break, a sing-along.  And also, we've got to introduce this side of the show to Charlie.  Yeah, we had Charlie on.  And to the people that heard this yesterday and they're rolling their eyes.  Shut up.  It's going to be a very good exercise because we're going to show you how ridiculous radio has become. 
[00:48:30]  Because we took Charlie from yesterday, a homeless guy that's hilarious.  He's kind of like a homeless Richard Pryor.  He's got some fine comedy chops.  Yeah.  And he made us laugh so hard yesterday, but he was cursing like crazy.  So to play it over here, we had to beep out the curses, but some of the material that he was doing was just fine.  Oddly enough, listen to the difference between what is allowed and what isn't.  What's not allowed?  It's stunning.  That's what makes the bit pretty funny for the people that heard it today.  I heard it yesterday.  He was a real potty mouth as well as pants. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, man.  Tell me about it.  I love how we figured out how to just get a mic into the other part of the studio up there.  Yeah.  So we don't have to bring the homeless into our studio to stink it up.  Yeah.  Because, man, there hasn't been one homeless person that hasn't completely stunk up the studio.  Well, Charlie's a hit.  We'll play some of the audio from yesterday, and we'll explain that and a sing-along next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:49:30]  Hey, how you doing?  This is Bill Burr.  I'm going to be at Giggles Comedy Club this weekend, May 11th and May 12th in Seattle, Washington.  Go to gigglescomedyclub.com or call 206-526-5653 for tickets.  Thank you.  I love that we work on the show during the breaks. 
[00:50:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show, by the way.  Larry the Cable Guy coming in in about 15, 20 minutes.  We love Larry the Cable Guy.  We had a great time with him last time he was on.  And just before we turned on the mics, Anthony said that he took Club Soda Kenny's advice.  Yeah, I was taking Club Soda Kenny's advice from yesterday by trying to fool your muscles, you know, by lifting.  Because we were asking him kind of yesterday, you know, because Kenny is just a workout animal. 
[00:50:30]  And everybody asks advice of Kenny on working out and stuff like that.  And he said, you know, I was asking about weight.  Yeah.  And he goes, well, you got to fool your muscles.  Sometimes throw a little less weight on, sometimes a little more.  They won't expect it.  It's like your muscles have little brains in them.  Right.  It's like, hey, what the hell is this?  Now, the other day, this was about 15 pounds lighter. 
[00:51:00]  So I was just doing that yesterday, and I fooled it on the upside.  And now I'm feeling it a little today.  A little tight, a little sore.  A little sore, but not bad.  We're all getting in fighting shape for the big summer tour.  The eye-cobbing virus comedy tour.  We all got to get in shape because it's going to be a long summer.  You don't want to look like a piece of crap up there, man.  No days off for the boys.  One reason why we had to take two weeks.  If I could fool my muscles, I would just trick them into thinking they'd worked out. 
[00:51:30]  Exactly.  Hey, they fooled me.  I know.  I'm working on my 10-inch pythons.  You know, that's why I'm doing it.  My little twig arms.  I know.  I'm a skinny little guy.  What was I going to say?  I'm working on my yoga break.  I'm not there yet.  Uh-uh-uh.  I'm not there yet.  A little yoga.  I was ready to bring the skin doctor to the radio show, but I'm not ready to bring the  yoga thing to the show yet. 
[00:52:00]  Doing a little yoga.  Perfectly healthy.  Old yoga.  Aleister Crowley was one of the biggest Satanists ever.  He was a yoga fanatic.  It's not unmasculine.  Is that Mr. Crowley?  Yes.  He was also bisexual.  Mr. Crowley!  Really?  That guy?  Yes.  He was a what?  He was a tremendous yoga person.  He was a sex fanatic.  He was just a dirty, dirty boy.  Mussolini threw him out of Italy for being too degenerate.  Really?  Yeah.  That's a great story.  He was like a cat's blood or something.  He was just a real kook.  He was a goose, as we say. 
[00:52:30]  Well, I got like two of those herniated discs from all those years of being active, and  I went to rehab, and I'm fine and all, but...  Why?  You just started drinking because of it?  And they...  Oh.  Yeah.  There's other kind of rehab?  And then they suggested the old yoga.  Yoga.  To kind of get the back nice and strong, but I'm not ready to bring it to the table yet.  I got to get some more observations, and then we'll do a yoga break.  Yeah.  Is that it?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm going to look into it a little more so you can do the break without making it sound 
[00:53:00]  like you're effeminate.  Oh, dude, man.  I'll be completely honest with you.  It's quite faggy.  Yeah?  It is quite faggy.  But I hear it's...  Not a lot of masculine guys doing the yoga.  Let's just put it that way.  Because it puts you in these positions that make you look a little silly as a guy.  But what makes that all right is the fact that there's all women around you for the  most part, so you get to see some interesting things. 
[00:53:30]  Well, that's good.  But...  Wow.  You get to see a lot of stuff.  See some guys, too, huh?  Look at me trying to make yoga cool.  I get it.  Wow.  I like yoga, man.  If I didn't have a bad right foot, I would have done a lot more of it.  It's great for you.  You and that goddamn foot.  What's wrong with it?  I need surgery.  No, you don't.  Okay.  Do you?  No.  I just wanted some sympathy.  I'll give it to you.  Can I touch on one thing?  Because you said rehab real quick.  And just...  Yeah. 
[00:54:00]  You want to talk about gratitude?  It's in the post.  I would never say it.  HBO's boss, Chris Albrecht, who I like a lot.  I mean, he was very, very...  Jimmy knows this guy pretty well.  Oh, yeah.  Because he did a half-hour comedy special.  He did Lucky Louie.  And now he's doing his one-hour HBO comedy special, which is something every comedian in the  world wants to do.  And Jimmy gets to do it, what, in early June in Washington?  22nd in D.C.  Yeah, we're all going down for the taping.  We're very excited about that.  Well, that was Chris Albrecht, who was the president.  Unfortunately, Time Warner, he stepped down because of the domestic violence thing, I 
[00:54:30]  guess, in Vegas.  And this is in the post on page six.  Well, what happened, just in case people don't know?  I mean, he had an altercation with his girlfriend?  Yeah.  Apparently, they said he choked her and was like...  I don't know if he hit her, but he did...  I've made an ass of myself.  Yeah.  It was pretty...  It was said here, he allegedly punched and choked his girlfriend.  Obviously, it wasn't just a shove for HBO.  It was at an HBO event, like the fight, like outside, I guess.  So, it was a big deal. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  And Albrecht had to step down because Time Warner owns it.  But he said here...  He was a comic.  I didn't know that.  The former comic went on leave, blah, blah, blah.  And he informed colleagues, he had been sober for 13 years, but two years ago, I decided  I could handle drinking again.  Clearly, I was wrong.  And that is just like...  Oh, boy.  Oh, dude.  Hug him.  Clearly, I was wrong.  What it cost you, man.  Wow.  And you would think someone...  I had no idea he didn't drink or didn't.  I don't know.  And you would think someone in his position would realize... 
[00:55:30]  Well, I don't...  Why would I say that?  Well, you think probably, like, ah, life is great now.  I'm going to drop my game.  Right, right.  Maybe I could handle this after all.  Because you're in a different place in life.  Yeah.  So you can like...  You know how good that buzz has to feel, though, after that many...  After that long?  You know how good a drink has to feel after that long?  I've heard...  I've probably just made, like, 80 alcoholics take a shot.  Including me.  Yeah, Jimmy, you know.  There are times you're thinking about it, right?  You have this day?  Do you ever teeter just thinking about it?  Very rarely. 
[00:56:00]  My sickness attacks me another way now.  It's almost too obvious to go, go have a drink.  My mother probably goes, shut your face.  Yeah.  But it does say things like, you don't need people.  You can do this yourself.  You know, it hits me differently just to isolate me and cause horrible depression.  You know, it doesn't tell me.  Oh, Jimmy.  It doesn't tell me a little thing.  Jimmy needs a hug.  I do.  Yeah.  He rocked.  That was bothersome.  Yeah, that is bothersome.  He's a nice guy.  What also is bothersome is people saying, why aren't you doing Pilates?  I did them yesterday.  Pilates just sounds not good.  That sounds like another girl thing. 
[00:56:30]  Well...  Like, yeah, Pilates.  I had to go to...  Why don't you go to a spinning class?  Yeah.  There you go.  Spinning is another thing that, like...  Of course, it's a hell of a workout, but it's not quite the most masculine workout thing  you could do in it.  You know what, though?  There's not one person in this room that could get through a spinning class.  I know.  And I consider myself in a pretty good state.  Dude, I couldn't do yoga.  But in my gym, I see those spinning classes going on.  I'm like, wow.  Insanity.  I got a ways to go still. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  Pilates is good.  But Pilates, it sounds Pilate-ish.  Pilates.  We did 10 minutes yesterday because we were running late, and then we just did thighs.  Oh.  You watch the DVD, and you do thighs.  You and other men touching them together?  Yes.  Jimmy actually has exercise, like, DVDs and stuff.  Do you?  I need, like, real interaction.  Do you actually, like, you know, on your cable, you can go to the exercise channel?  Jimmy goes to the exercise channel and does Pilates with his girlfriend.  It's good when you have a mat.  I forgot about this. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, but you have a mat at home.  It's good to do once in a while.  You invite a guy over named what?  No, you don't invite a mat do over.  Oh, I thought it was something a little kinky.  And I hear you follow the easy girl or something, your girlfriend.  Oh, is there, like, three different ones?  Your girlfriend, like.  Okay, two ones.  There's the high-energy one, and then the low-impact one.  Oh, your girlfriend threw you under the bus.  I forgot about this.  We're in Vegas.  Oh.  And she told me that Jimmy does the Pilates on TV with her.  And she's in really good shape.  Yes.  Really good shape. 
[00:58:00]  And she said that Jimmy follows the easy girl.  Oh, the easy girl.  And they even announced ahead of time, if you're just getting started with Pilates,  you might want to follow Susan.  And Susan's just not as in shape as the other girls.  No, what happens is this.  It's this crunch Pilates DVD.  And the girl is like, I'm going to do this.  And Betsy will have her legs half bent.  Her name is Betsy.  And she does everything halfway.  Halfway.  All halfway Betsy.  You want to choke Betsy. 
[00:58:30]  It's just funny to watch.  We would always say things like, while I'm doing this, we would throw in, Betsy will be napping.  Betsy does nothing.  I don't know how she's in shape.  I think Betsy makes herself throw up before the shoot.  But Pilates, man, that's a workout.  It's all about the core breathing.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  It's rough.  You know what?  My chick does it and then critiques me.  Like, your legs aren't.  I want to shut your mouth.  Someone suggests you do a baby size.  You get some baby size videos.  Dude, I'll tell you one thing about yoga, though. 
[00:59:00]  I mean, I'm just getting started.  And it's tough to get through a class.  Yeah.  Without farting.  I've heard that about yoga, too.  Like, you're twisting yourself in all these positions and people are just blasting left and right.  Dude, that's all you hear in the room.  I hope they got a good ventilation system in there.  Oh, yeah.  Windows wide open.  You hear some.  And they want you to do the.  When you're breathing out.  I refuse to do that.  Oh, stop it. 
[00:59:30]  But, man, you can't get through a class without a little toot here and there.  A little toot.  A little sound that says you're doing the moves right.  Yeah.  You're not doing it right.  Does the instructor do it?  What?  No.  He's not.  Blast one out?  The guy's an animal.  It's ridiculous.  Every so often.  No, you're not doing it right unless you're.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, but you hear it coming from all over the room.  Oh, that's disgusting.  It really is, but it's really funny, too, man. 
[01:00:00]  I want a yoga body.  Do you?  We've always said it.  Fart equals funny no matter what.  Yeah.  I mean, it's disgusting and all that.  Blah, blah, blah.  Do they snicker?  You kind of look around and see some smiles.  You know, people are trying to, like, stay cool, but it's really funny, man.  All right, are we ready for our sing-along?  The one guy's mad has turned into a slip and slide.  Are we ready for our sing-along? 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  We found a star.  He's the latest internet star.  I don't know if this guy is.  I think this guy's on our website.  Is retarded in some way, shape, or form.  Are you allowed to say that still?  Well, I'll say retarded until it doesn't make sense to say it.  And the word retarded means held back, slightly pulled back, not at the full potential.  You're retarding something.  So it applies mentally to certain people on this planet. 
[01:01:00]  That's all.  That's all I'm trying to say.  And it was completely acceptable when I was a kid, but so are some other words, especially in my household.  Retarded.  Oh, by the way, just to back up, because I am developing my yoga break here, I forgot to tell you.  A lot of people would assume that this guy, the yoga instructor, is gay.  It's coming in like crazy on the feedback.  Yeah.  He talks about his wife, that she does her own class and stuff. 
[01:01:30]  Whatever.  Sure.  I'm just setting up what I'm about to say.  Now you're in a yoga class, and it's pretty much all women, me and two or three other almost guys.  I'm like, what am I doing here?  And all of a sudden, because it's a beginner class, we're doing positions and stuff, and you see how I'm slouching?  Yeah.  Like if you're really good at yoga, you wouldn't be slouching?  No, you'd sit up straight in your chair.  And like Jimmy said, he wants a yoga body.  Well, this guy has the yoga body. 
[01:02:00]  What is a yoga body?  He doesn't have an ounce of fat on him, right?  And then in the middle of the class, like it's already awkward that you look like a total dick doing these positions and stuff.  And the farts are coming.  You're a beginner, right?  All of a sudden, he decides he needs to show the class his spine and his back and his abs to show you that you're in the right position.  So in the middle of the class, he just takes off his shirt.  Oh, God, what a show off.  And all the women, you could just hear them all just like, just like they're trying to control themselves. 
[01:02:30]  I'm like, oh, great.  Did you hear a couple of, oh.  Yeah, like, mm.  I mean, from the other, ooh, ooh, ooh.  Oh.  Oh, but half the women in the place can't control themselves.  I'm like, oh, just great.  Well, you put your shirt on.  Put your shirt on.  What a stunt that is.  Come on.  And then he's, like, stretching his back and pushing out his chest and bending all the way over.  I bet he is.  Just showing what he's got to offer to the women, basically. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  It was like a mating call.  It's a freaking mating call in the middle of the class.  He knows because he's got all the plumage.  Right.  And you guys look like plucked chickens walking around.  He knows the score.  He's got the plumage, and we all look like veals just getting started here.  Right.  They finally let us out of our little, like, dark box.  Yeah.  I was impressed, though.  I'm like, nice move, dude.  Bravo.  Bravo to you.  Obviously, you're looking for some strange you-know-what. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, he's probably...  You go for it, buddy.  He's probably working it.  I'm like, all right, you got to give him credit.  A straight guy in a yoga class, man.  Even if they're all straight guys that are there, it doesn't matter.  They're so...  Most of them are women.  I've never taken a class.  I always had people come to my house because I knew with my stupid foot I couldn't do a lot of this stuff.  I never do that.  Why?  I never do DVDs or people come to that.  Because I got to leave the house.  I got to leave the house because putting a DVD of a workout, I'd rather put in, like, Caddyshack. 
[01:04:00]  I'll just sit on my ass and watch television unless I have to physically get up and go to a place that is exclusively made for exercising without any other entertainment value whatsoever.  Or I'll just be distracted.  I'm like a child.  All right.  Well, we got to get to this thing along because we got Larry the Cable Guy.  He's here.  He's ready to do our show.  So, where were you, Ann?  I'm sorry.  I backed...  Oh, this guy.  Yeah, I don't know if he's retarded or drunk or on drugs or something. 
[01:04:30]  He's just some guy.  I think it seems like he's at some kind of a Baptist church.  I don't know.  I couldn't tell, really.  But he's an African-American gentleman.  And he's up at the podium, whatever they call it.  What do they call it in a church?  The podium.  The pulpit.  The pulpit.  The pulpit.  He's at the pulpit.  And he...  Doing Pilates with Betsy. 
[01:05:00]  He decides he just wants to improv Betsy.  Betsy will be having a stroke.  Betsy stinks.  I know.  She just collapses on the throw rug in the corner.  Go ahead.  And he decides he wants to sing.  Yeah.  To sing a little song to inspire the crowd that's there.  And it would be nice if you knew the words.  Oh, really?  That's what happens?  Yeah.  Yeah.  If you're going to sing the song... 
[01:05:30]  Well, everyone knows the first couple of words to this song.  But then he doesn't know the rest.  But he...  Let me tell you something.  Hang in there with this one.  Because he brings it on home.  Does he really?  Oh, God.  I only heard the first minute.  Other people try to chime in to cover up how awful he is.  Yeah.  Basically, if you're going to sing Amazing Grace in a church, you should know all the words.  All the words.  All right.  Here we go.  Praise the Lord.  Jesus, in the name of the Lord.  Praise the Lord.  Amen.  I'm going to sing Amazing Grace.  How sweet the sound. 
[01:06:00]  Amazing Grace.  I want people to sing with me, too.  Amazing Grace.  How sweet the sound.  I've made an ass of myself.  Say you're with me.  The organ chimes in now to try to cover it up. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, God.  You're my way.  You're my way.  What?  You should have stopped right there. 
[01:07:00]  I'm going home to you.  Now, another guy starts singing.  And a grace.  My grace.  Give me.  He's riffing.  Oh, my God.  You're my way. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, yes, I'm young.  Oh, yes, I'm young.  They wanted a sound right there, too.  Oh, yes, I'm young.  Oh, yes, I'm young. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, yes, I'm young. 
[01:08:30]  I'm young.  Oh, yes, I'm young.  Oh, yes, I'm young.  Amen, amen, amen, thank you, thank you, oh, oh, is that great, if I was in a church 
[01:09:00]  and I saw that thing singing, I would renounce God and walk out, how do you believe in any  type of a higher power after watching that, exactly, I thought Wesley Willis was dead,  that's what it sounds like, it sounds like Wesley Willis, huh, I would tell you to go  to numerous websites, some of our own, yeah, that we can't mention, I don't think, I don't 
[01:09:30]  know, whatever, but dig up the video of that, it is hysterical to watch this guy, when he  riffs like that, he started feeling it, and you can tell the keyboardist, the organ, wants  to stop, he like drags out the last note, and then he just kicks in again, oh man, they're  like, oh no, we gotta do another verse, oh, he brings it on home at the end, yeah, we gotta  take a break, okay, we got Larry the Cable Guy here too, coming in, yeah, it's on our website  and it's also on break.com, break.com's been great to the show, so give them a plug today 
[01:10:00]  as well, Larry the Cable Guy, yes, next on the Opie and Anthony Show, it's the Opie and  Anthony Show, the virus is spreading, Opie and Anthony, welcome back to the Opie and  Anthony Show, one of the co-hosts is choking, swallowing something, and of course, we're  back, we have Larry the Cable Guy in the studio, we haven't had you on in a long time, man.  No, you know what, when was the last time I was here, about last year, last year, was 
[01:10:30]  it last year, it's been about a year, but I heard y'all talking about Pilates, yeah,  yeah, yeah, I went to you on that, I never done any either, but in college, I did a lot  of Pilates.  I think that might be a little different.  I remember my wife always said, I always try and find something to get in shape, you  know, because I'm blowing up like a tick on Dracula, and my wife says, why don't you try 
[01:11:00]  yoga, you ever tried that?  Yeah.  I never want to get my nose that close to my ass crack again, all right, good, Lord.  You get it close to a lot of other people's ass cracks, though, man, they're right next  to you as you try and do this crap.  You won't eat, though, you want some chili?  No, I got yoga tomorrow, better not.  Yeah.  I'll come out looking like I was working on a coal mine all week.  Yeah.  Apparently, Opie's trying that out, that yoga thing, and no, sorry.  I'm with you, that's not for me.  All I picture is a room full of people on mats on all fours with their noses too close 
[01:11:30]  to someone else's rear end, and like you said, you're twisting in these positions where  you're kind of losing gas, and the room stinks.  And someone else is saying that those sounds are something different than farts, too.  Oh, maybe in the ladies.  Yeah.  I understand.  Yeah.  Some yoga experts are checking in.  So, you do anything to stay in shape, Larry?  Oh, well, I went jogging a couple weeks ago. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah?  I didn't want to.  My car broke down in the crappy neighborhood.  I lost eight pounds in my CD changer.  But, you know, it's just tough.  You know, I was getting kind of worried because, you know, I just like food.  And I went in for a checkup a while back, and the doctor, his eyes were just, and he's like,  you need to lay up eggs.  And I'm like, oh, damn, is my cholesterol bad?  He said, no, your farts are killing it.  And, but I'll tell you what you shouldn't do is eat in bed.  No.  Because that'll kill you. 
[01:12:30]  And I remember I fell asleep with the fondue pot on a couple weeks back and woke up and  had third degree cheese burns on my testicles, and I still ain't found the fondue forks.  And perhaps there are certain foods maybe best suited.  Maybe not.  Well, I'm not doing that anymore.  I take the rotisserie off the headboard and everything.  So, I'm done with that.  Yeah, I'm finished with that.  But, no, it's good to see.  See, I've got to tell you, I'm kind of groggy today.  Ever since they moved that TV show, Friday Night Lights, to Wednesdays, I just don't know  what the hell day it is. 
[01:13:00]  It's bizarre.  Can I tell you, as a comic, the one thing you don't want to hear when you're doing a  city is, oh, it's good.  Larry the Cable Guy is there the same night.  The chicken sales are not good.  Wait, is that happening again?  No, it didn't.  Poughkeepsie, I wanted to shoot myself.  We had Larry on, and you were going, I think it was Houston.  You were at the local improv, and he was playing, like, the Astrodome or something.  No, I'm not even kidding.  Wherever the Super Bowl is held, that's where he's doing a gig. 
[01:13:30]  And I think I did the improv.  And I wouldn't draw in Houston if every other comedy club in Houston blew up, and mine was  the only one that was available.  But when you're competing against him, it was, oh, in Poughkeepsie, he sold so many seats  he had to come back two weeks later and do the same venue when it was available again.  You know what, Poughkeepsie was nuts.  It was Poughkeepsie, we did, I went in, I did two nights, two shows a night, and then  I came back ten days later and did two more shows.  That's pretty cool.  I'll tell you what, good fans of me.  You do have a rabid following. 
[01:14:00]  A massive following.  And so does he.  He's kind of.  Well, yeah.  But literally rabid.  They bite.  They give you diseases that kill you.  A little different, Larry.  Yeah, if you want to compare our followings, picture Fiji and China.  Yeah, if you want to go, like, numbers-wise.  I actually do a room in China and kick ass.  I was just going to say, Jesus Christ.  Get that done, get that done.  Yeah, you just have a ridiculous following.  And what do you attribute that to? 
[01:14:30]  Well, you know.  There's a lot of comics out there.  Well, you know what, I don't know.  I think I just kind of struck on something people like.  You know, I've always just learned, you know, you be good to your fans, your fans be good to you.  And, I mean, I honestly love, I love them to death.  I mean, it's kind of like a family reunion sort of when I show up.  You know, I'm just on stage and doing one-liners and having fun.  And they really don't care what I do.  They can care less about the political correctness.  I think, and as you find out, the more that you go through your career, people, they're sick of that crap. 
[01:15:00]  They want to come out and laugh.  And they don't want to be preached at.  They don't want somebody to act like they're better than them.  They just want to pay money and laugh.  And I think I provide that.  And they are.  They're just good crowds.  And, of course, they've been.  I've built that following throughout the years.  Yeah.  So it's not like I just showed up and go, hey, let's go see this guy.  Larry, I just want to jump in.  You say that they're sick of the political correctness and they want to come out and just laugh and stuff. 
[01:15:30]  We truly believe that is the exact same thing with radio.  But for some reason, the media has gotten a hold of this radio thing.  And they think everyone should be nice and not make fun of particular groups.  Well, the media thinks that they know better than anybody else.  But our audience is like, no, this is why we listen to you guys.  It's refreshing.  You're saying stuff that we wish we could say to our bosses and to the people around us.  Well, you know, it's like, I forget who it was, but them other people got fired for doing a Chinese joke or something. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, yeah.  JV and Elvis.  Yeah, those guys.  Meanwhile, you got Chinese people calling up going, oh, that sucks, man.  Them guys are funny.  Right.  But you had one guy.  It's almost like the media is like the super minority media are the ones making the rules for everybody else.  And they shouldn't be doing that.  Picture you're playing in front of a packed crowd of your fans and three people walk in and say, well, I don't like what you're saying. 
[01:16:30]  Everyone leave.  And it's like, well, wait a minute.  We're thousands of people enjoying what's happening.  Yeah, where's their voice?  Why can't we get to be heard?  But for some reason, with radio, the people get up and leave.  Right.  There's no backbone in especially the corporate world.  There's no backbone.  People obviously don't write letters when they enjoy something.  It's just when something pisses them off.  You know, and it's so frustrating that such a small minority of people that get offended and their feelings have such power. 
[01:17:00]  You know, it is.  It makes me mad at a midget with a yo-yo.  You know, I mean, but it's like when I was up in North Dakota, they're suing the NCAA, North Dakota University, because the NCAA wants them to get rid of the fight and sue.  And everybody up there wants them to keep the name, including the sue.  The sue, right.  Except for one guy up there.  And, of course, the media, they're the guy that they're pulling for. 
[01:17:30]  Uh-huh.  And it's like, you know, if everybody else wants it, then why does it – who – why – I just don't understand why the media – who died and left them God?  Yeah.  I don't understand it, you know.  They'll go, well, that's offensive.  Well, to you.  Yeah.  But not to the – all the 80% of the people watching it.  Yep.  If you don't like it, don't listen to them.  Don't listen.  Turn it off.  You know what?  Yeah, I don't get it.  But, you know, I think that's what, you know, the crowd's like.  I think when you go up and you do your act and you're funny and you give them a good show and you don't apologize for anything you do because the minute you start apologizing – 
[01:18:00]  They know they got you.  They know they got you.  So they can kiss my ass.  You know, I'm not apologizing for nothing.  If it's funny, I'm doing it.  And the only people I got to make happy are those people buying those tickets.  Mm-hmm.  And, you know, I think you feel the same way.  Absolutely, man.  What happened with you?  I don't know David Cross.  I met him once.  There was an ongoing thing with you guys, and I don't know who – I don't know the detail. 
[01:18:30]  I just know that there was an ongoing battle.  Did he attack you or did you attack him or what happened?  You know what I would say?  There was no battle at all.  And I've always said to this day, I've always thought he was funny.  I watched his shows.  My wife loves his shows.  And – but I had just – he had said something in an interview I did.  And he even says he started.  He said he started on Camel.  I mean – but he had said something that wasn't very flattering about my fans, saying  my fans are all a bunch of back-ass, hillbilly rednecks, no education, which isn't true. 
[01:19:00]  You know, I mean, for God's sake, I got to –  That's true for some of them, not Larry.  Well, you know what, but that's true for any act.  Oh, yeah.  All right?  I mean –  Have you seen our fans?  Oh, wow.  Oh, Jesus.  One of them asked me for a dollar.  They don't like your –  Our fans think your fans are uppity.  Exactly.  But – so that was – so I basically just said, hey, what are you getting my fans for?  You know, they're just coming out and having a good time.  And I never really said anything at all bad about him. 
[01:19:30]  I was basically sticking up for my fans.  But that's all done and over with.  I mean, God bless the guy.  I mean, he's got a career.  He's successful.  He's a funny guy.  I got – I don't know grudge against – I'm not sure if he came in here right now,  I'd go, hey, what's up, Dave?  You know, no big deal.  Nothing better than a good comedy war.  Well, you know, I think people were trying to start a comedy war, and it didn't happen.  So I think they're disappointed.  But, hey, you know, more power to him.  I always say this.  Anybody that's doing stand-up comedy, God bless them. 
[01:20:00]  It isn't easy, and it's hard to do.  And I've been blessed to be able to get these big crowds.  But I started in 1985, and I worked my hind end off to get to where I am.  So, you know, I used to call radio stations, up to 27 of them, every day, five days a week,  six in the morning to 1130 in the afternoon.  You were one of those guys – we talked about that last time.  You had a whole list of stations, and you had to make believe you were only part of that station,  and then you moved on to the next one, right? 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  What was the character you did?  I had to act like I lived everywhere.  Oh, it was Larry –  Well, it was just me calling up as –  I was Larry the cable guy.  I was calling up as the cable guy.  The cable guy, right, right, right.  Yeah, so, I mean, so, you know, you just –  But you had to be local.  I had to localize everything.  Somebody called –  I didn't even know where the hell I was – you know, where I was at.  How often would you call each station?  Would you give it, like, a month or two weeks, or how often would you –  You know –  Almost weekly, I think.  There was probably 30% of them I called every day.  There was a small percent I called one day a week. 
[01:21:00]  Every day, though, I was – the least I would do in a day would be eight.  Eight stations.  Yeah, and the most I would do in a day would be, like, 14.  But some of them, you know, were just one day a week.  Sometimes you're just calling on Friday.  But your Friday was always your big day, because everybody wanted you on Friday to do, like, a weekly wrap-up.  Right.  You know, what's going on?  Dude, so you're writing jokes.  You're up at 3 in the morning going, oh, damn.  And the funny thing about doing that was sometimes you're just tapped. 
[01:21:30]  You know, there's nothing going on.  There's just nothing.  You're just tapped.  And so I go, well, this really sucks, this commentary I've written.  I'm going to act like I am hammered.  And so I just call up, hey, fellas.  And you think it's, like, disaster.  You're just acting like you're hammered through the whole thing.  And then you've got friends calling you up, dude, it was hilarious.  I had nothing.  I know, exactly.  How did you remember what you did?  Because I actually thought of him when I was in the Midwest recently, because I think he's legendary for doing that as a comic. 
[01:22:00]  He's getting up to the radio station.  He's an animal.  How do you remember what you said?  I forget what I said here, and I'm only here.  How do you remember what you said on this station?  Oh, I said that last Tuesday when I called them.  Oh, no, wait.  Was that Wichita?  How do you remember?  Well, when I was doing those, I wrote out a script.  So once that station was done, once I did this same script for everybody, that one was filed away, and we did another one.  You know, I would do another one.  Yeah, it's called professionalism, Jimmy.  How could anybody begrudge him success?  Oh, my God.  He paid his dues, man. 
[01:22:30]  I literally got notebooks and notebooks and stacks and stacks of just social commentaries.  I mean, all the way up.  I mean, I think, you know, back to the end of the Bush senior years is when I started doing the commentary.  Wow.  All through Clinton, all through the first half of Bush.  You could get a whole history lesson just going through your files.  Oh, man, I got a lot of good material off doing Reno and all that, so I miss them, guys.  Damn.  What's on your mind these days?  What do you think of the president and the tornado? 
[01:23:00]  And we got a lot of cool stuff going on these days.  Well, I'll tell you the one thing is the global warming stuff.  I mean, I'd be more apt to believe that stuff if a bunch of wingnuts weren't pushing it.  You know, like Al Gore's walked around.  Have you seen Al Gore?  Evidently, global warming ain't melted his ice cream.  Good job.  And then Sheryl Crow, one square of toilet paper.  You know, we were off the air.  Thank you for bringing that up.  We were off the air.  We did two weeks of vacation, and that was the big story. 
[01:23:30]  She wants everyone to use one square of toilet paper.  To save you.  Evidently, Sheryl...  What the hell does she eat?  Yeah, evidently, she ain't been eating what I'm eating.  Right.  Hey, Sheryl, come to my grandma's house on Sloppy Joe night.  You'll use the whole roll, the tube, and a couple pillowcases.  Sloppy Joe night.  Well, you know, Sheryl Crow.  Just another person that's out of touch with the whole thing.  One sheet of toilet paper.  It really irritates you. 
[01:24:00]  You know, even if I was single, I would not have sex with Sheryl Crow.  Sheryl Crow was...  All right, I would.  All right, never mind.  I would.  I don't mean it.  Just smash it in the mouth of that dumb guitar to shut her up.  Yeah.  We get it.  You can sing.  Shut up.  I always love these talk shows.  Like, I say, oh, my God, listen to these talk shows.  I think it's always funny.  We go to, you know, Des Moines.  There's some guy talking and railing on Rumsfeld and what an idiot he was and blah, blah.  And I'm thinking to myself, and I'm not really, you know, you don't know.  I'm not in that field. 
[01:24:30]  I don't know.  But I'm just thinking to myself, here you got a guy that went to West Point and spent his entire career studying the great military leaders and battles  and earned all these medals and studying the art of war.  And yet, Ricky, the assistant manager from Radio Shack, is calling him an idiot.  You know, oh, Ricky, let Ricky run the war. 
[01:25:00]  He knows what's going on.  You know, I just like...  See, our take on that is, like, we do that stuff, obviously, but we have these in front of us, microphones, so we're experts.  Right.  You get a microphone in front of you, you're now an expert on everything.  No matter what you say, you're right, because you got a microphone.  Oh, man, is that funny?  That's really funny, man.  That gets hilarious.  It's too goddamn true, man.  I was another one of the blue-collar guys who I only met once or twice, who I love, Ron White, who just... 
[01:25:30]  All he does is drink.  He's the greatest.  I know.  I heard he's flying...  Is he, like, flying private planes?  I hear he's really enjoying life.  Oh, he's enjoying life.  But I'll tell you what, Ron has not had a sip of liquor in 132 days.  Oh, cool, man.  Yeah, I think it's 132.  He was a slurring when he said that.  Can I point out, that's how you know you're an alcoholic.  When your friends go, it's been 132 days.  And we're hoping he can make 140.  I got a joke about Ron.  I said, we're over to Ron's house, and he's got, like, a diploma above his office. 
[01:26:00]  And I didn't even know him went to college.  He said, well, what college did you graduate from?  He goes, no, that's a liquor license.  Oh, all right.  That makes sense.  You guys now, I mean, obviously, you're doing very well for yourselves.  And your audience, I think, seems like the type of audience, like ours, too, wants that credibility, wants that, you know, down-to-earth kind of, you're not getting too high and mighty.  And they know, ours especially, to pull us right back down, you know, to earth if we start thinking we're a little too, you know. 
[01:26:30]  Do you find it hard, though, the more success you get, to keep relatable with the audience?  Well, no, not at all.  And I'll tell you why.  You know, it's just, you know, I've got the same friends I've always had before this started.  I mean, my two best buddies in the world are my buddy Brad Ward from Sanford, Florida, who looks just like me in his southern accent.  You can't even understand the guy.  And my other good buddy is Marty Hill from Tulsa, Oklahoma, who's a cattle auctioneer. 
[01:27:00]  And they're my two best friends, and they have been, and we always hang out together.  I live in the same place I've always lived.  I just moved one house down.  My brother lives in my old house.  I haven't moved to L.A. or New York, so I keep it pretty ground, you know.  I imagine that one house down is a little nicer than the house you left.  It's a mini mall.  Is it a little better than your...  I'm not going to sit here and listen to that.  A mini mall.  It is.  Right.  You moved into the mall, right?  Very good, Jimmy.  No, it is.  I mean... 
[01:27:30]  Hey, it is bigger.  Obviously, it is.  Come on, we love you.  I'm not going to give his brother the big house.  We love you, but we can't let that slide.  I think that other house is a little nicer, man.  Well, it is.  It's a couple thousand square feet bigger.  All right.  But no, but I'm just saying, I haven't...  Honestly, I haven't really bought myself anything too extravagant, but I mean, I like nice things.  I mean, who wouldn't?  Yeah, every so often you go out and fend some money.  Yeah, but, you know, I really haven't changed much else.  I mean, I dress like this because I like dressing like this.  It's not because I'm just... 
[01:28:00]  It's for show.  I mean, I live in Florida.  It's hot.  I love wearing sleeveless shirts.  So, boom, I do it.  So, you guys, what are your crowds?  Like, you're doing a lot of 5,000-seat venues.  Are you still doing...  Occasionally, you're doing, like, bigger than that, right?  Oh, I've been...  You know, for the last three years, I've been on an arena tour.  Yes.  Hey, three years, Jimmy.  A three-year arena tour.  He's going to hang himself, Larry.  Don't do this to him, man.  But I'm happy for him because I love the fact that a comic is doing that,  and I also want to kill myself and him out of disgusting jealousy. 
[01:28:30]  But a three-year arena tour, it's my...  How about you do one of our shows just for free as a goof?  Yeah, just to be...  Just as a goof.  Yeah, that's good.  We can't afford you, but we can give you a nice crowd.  I tell you what, if I was close and you all were doing something,  I'd come in and say, oh, it'd be good to me.  I mean, I'd do something like that in a heartbeat if I was around.  Well, we do our comedy tour.  It's the second summer, and we did pretty well last year.  We got some nice numbers.  Not Larry the Cable Guy.  I bet he's booked up for every date.  I'm sure.  I'm sure.  Because as soon as these mics go off, he goes, ah, talk to my people. 
[01:29:00]  But no, but if I was close and you all were doing that,  I would more than happy be to do it.  All right, you heard it here.  Larry the Cable Guy might show up in one of the OHL and virus comedy shows.  But I'm not flying in for you bastards.  Hold on, Larry.  Ticket sales are lagging in a couple of places.  Larry the Cable Guy will be appearing on 10 of the 12 virus shows.  Why don't you hint that you just might be in the Boston area.  We're up there.  We can use a little help up there.  Oh, Boston.  I was up there a while back.  I saw some of the weird...  I saw fat homeless people. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah?  How does that happen?  I have no idea.  They must be new, I guess.  I guess you really can.  Eat yourself out of house and home.  Hey, we got Dan from Alabama.  We got to get him on the phone here.  Dan, what's up?  I love you.  Love the show.  Yeah.  Thanks, man.  We force our listeners to say that, by the way.  Yeah.  We wanted to sound like they got a gun to their head, Larry.  That's how we roll here.  What's up, Dan?  Exactly.  Hey, I'd like to ask Larry to sort of tell a joke or two about us Southern truck drivers, 
[01:30:00]  if he sure would.  You don't like the Southern truck drivers, Larry?  I love the truck drivers.  Shoot, I like the truck drivers.  Yeah, I always liked the truck drivers.  You know, they always, you know, listen to you all on your X-Am there.  Oh, yeah.  Do you want to mention that on this?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I never know what I can mention or not.  Yeah, we're on there.  Yeah, no, truck drivers are awesome.  As a matter of fact, one time I remember, this is years ago, I was leaving the Comedy Zone  in Jacksonville, and this is probably 2001, you know, 2000, and some trucker told a joke. 
[01:30:30]  So I got on there, I told a joke, and then they laughed, and I told another, and they  laughed, and then he hears this truck, they go, keep them coming, boy, keep them coming.  And I drove two hours all the way back to Orlando on my CB, because I got a big old Dodge  truck on a 12-inch and 38, and I was driving it down the road.  I did a two-hour show on the way to Orlando, and I had all these truckers chiming in, oh,  that's a good thing. 
[01:31:00]  It was pretty hilarious.  CB radios are still out there.  Oh, yeah.  The truckers are still using them, obviously.  Oh, yeah.  Everyone has fun with their radios, and whatever work truck you're in.  Honestly, God, they are still.  I had the, my work fleet there at Apollo Air Conditioning had the Motorola radios, and  I used to have a microcassette recorder, and I would record the other guys calling the  bass, or the bass calling the other guys.  And then when I would drive, I would just play it back, and you'd hear like, 17 to bass, 
[01:31:30]  and then you'd hear bass go, go ahead, 17, and I'd rewind, 17 to bass, go ahead.  Like, and they get all pissed off, or bass to 12, yeah, yeah, go ahead, bass to 12.  What?  Can you hear me?  They'd get so pissed off.  Or they'd ask a question, and then an hour later, I'd have them ask the same question.  You asked me that an hour ago.  That's pretty fun.  Oh, it's fun with the radios, man. 
[01:32:00]  Tell you what, all you got to do is pick up a CB and say something good about Jeff Gordon,  and you will have a conversation on that CB for three hours on that thing.  Now, do you all follow NASCAR and all?  I try.  I try to figure it out.  My brother's a big fan of NASCAR.  Yeah.  Huge fan.  We did some of them at XM, so we kind of like, try to keep up a little bit, but we...  We had what's-his-name on, he was winning every race.  Jimmy Johnson?  Jimmy Johnson.  Yeah, we know the bigger names, but, you know.  Yeah, we became friends with Jimmy Johnson, we had him on a lot, and he was on a winning 
[01:32:30]  streak, and then, I don't know, I think we said something that might have...  Did we?  End of that relationship.  We haven't had him on in six months, and we liked the guy.  Yeah, they got...  We're always, like, blowing it.  We probably said something like, you know, we enjoyed watching his IndyCar race.  Yeah.  That would be...  Oh, it was...  Yeah, that would be the wrong sport.  We're total dopes.  Well, Larry, we did the Kentucky Derby.  Yeah, Larry, we're very hacky when we talk to the NASCAR driver.  We say all the dumb stuff, like, do you think of throwing stuff out the window to make other 
[01:33:00]  guys get flat tires?  We're really hacky with our NASCAR material.  Maybe you can help us out.  I don't know.  A smoke screen on the back?  Yeah, right.  Like James Bond?  Well, I like NASCAR better than formula, but I tell you what I do, like Danica Patrick.  Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.  I love how they say she's going to grab the pole on the weekend.  But that's the big thing now.  Everybody's pissed off they got Toyota at NASCAR.  Yeah.  And I'm like, oh, man, as long as they ain't got no Asian drivers, that's all I got to say. 
[01:33:30]  Good Lord.  And they're off.  Oh, there's a crash.  You know?  Plus, it's not good for the children, because you don't want to hear the announcer go, here  comes Dong up the rear every 25 minutes.  There you go.  We can update our NASCAR material now.  I can say that joke.  I got an Asian wife.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah, see?  Apparently, that doesn't wash.  Who knows?  Who knows when it washes?  No, I really don't.  It doesn't wash with Davey and Elvis. 
[01:34:00]  I really don't, but she likes crab rangoons.  Oh, okay.  That was close enough.  We got to get Larry out of here in a few minutes, because he's doing, like, another  10 TV shows today, and who knows what that is.  Yeah, we'll be seeing him popping up on the monitors behind us.  What show are you doing today after us?  Oh, you know what?  I'm doing Regis and Kelly.  Oh, that's cool.  That's a good show.  And then I'm doing Colton tonight.  Very cool.  And did you have to see me on Atlanta on Tuesday?  Dude, I was on with Matthew Fox from Lost.  Oh, yeah.  And I always like being the second guest. 
[01:34:30]  They always say, you want to be there?  And I'm like, no, I want to be the second guest.  I like playing off them acts, you know?  I had two great stories about that.  I was on with Matthew Fox, and of course, he's on Lost, and I go, you know, you and I have  a lot in common.  Your TV show and my movies, after everybody sees them, they say the same thing.  What the hell did I just watch?  I don't understand.  And I go, you name that show right because you missed one episode, you're freaking lost.  And then I was on, the best one, though, I was on with Kate Blanchett, and she's just 
[01:35:00]  prim and proper, you know, Juilliard school, the actress, you know.  And I'm doing my joke.  You know, I did that joke about, oh, your farts are killing us.  You know, and she's just stone-faced.  Oh, she can't believe she's hearing this stuff.  And so I did a joke about, I said, Jay, so I'm in Vegas and my toilet wouldn't flush.  And I couldn't figure out why.  And I took off the lid to my toilet tank.  You ain't going to believe what was in there.  David Blaine.  Right?  And everybody laughs. 
[01:35:30]  And I look at her, and she's just sitting there, stone-faced.  I go, you believe that, Blanchett?  Blanchett.  You believe that?  David Blaine holding his breath in my turd tank for four days.  And the look of horror on her face.  Oh, my buddy said that was hilarious.  That's why we love you, man.  Oh, man.  Well, you know what?  We should promote the movie.  I mean, that's why you're here, really, right?  Oh, yeah.  Delta Farce?  What's that about?  You know what?  Delta Farce is awesome.  Unlike my last movie, this one's a comedy. 
[01:36:00]  I had the premiere.  We had the premiere at Andrews Air Force Base,  whereas Health Inspector, we had the premiere at Abu Ghraib.  No, you know what?  This is a great movie.  It's me, DJ Qualls from Hustle and Flow and Road Trip.  That dude needs to eat a sandwich because that kid, good God,  I've thrown fish back way more than that kid.  He's like 6'1", 50 pounds.  And Bill Engvall.  But, you know, we get sent off to Iraq to think we're soldiers. 
[01:36:30]  We're not.  We're basically just out shooting guns at an armory,  and we get mistaken as soldiers.  We're on our way to Iraq.  Like, they go through a storm in the C-130,  and they've got to dump some equipment to lose an oil pressure,  and mistakenly, the Humvee rolls out the back of the C-130,  parachutes to the ground.  These guys wake up.  Oh, my God, we're in Iraq.  Lock and load, boys.  They're scared to death.  Well, they're in Mexico, and they have no idea.  And it was filmed on location in Los Angeles. 
[01:37:00]  So, you know what, it's a great movie, and, you know, it has absolutely, you know,  it's just military background for this, but it has nothing to do with the war in Iraq at all.  And we actually did premiere at Andrews Air Force Base,  brought a lot of the soldiers over from Walter Reed,  and I knew it was funny.  I knew they'd like it, but, I mean, the response we got was even more than I thought it would.  That's awesome.  And the cool thing was I got a letter from the colonel there at the Air Force Base,  and he said, man, this was awesome. 
[01:37:30]  The troops loved it.  There was absolutely no sensitivities in the movie, you know,  because you worry about stuff like that when you put something out,  because people can't handle it.  People can't separate politics from comedy anymore.  Nope.  But they loved it, and so I hope people go see it.  It's really a good movie, and it really is different than the first one.  This is an ensemble.  Everybody's got their share of jokes.  Danny Trejo's in it, that badass movie with the tattoo on his stomach,  and he's funny in this.  So, yeah, I hope people go check it out. 
[01:38:00]  We were going to change the name of it to Spider-Man 4.  Shut up.  You imagine that someone should do that just for the hell of it.  Ah, you're getting sued, I'm sure.  But the movie starts tomorrow.  Yeah, the movie starts tomorrow,  so I hope everybody here in the city goes out and checks it out.  And you were in Cars, which was just a great movie.  I loved the cartoons, man.  Yeah, the thing that sucked about it, though,  was because of Brokeback Mountain,  they took the part out where I got rear-ended.  And that was the part that stunk.  No, that was a cool, you just put a scratch on my scratch. 
[01:38:30]  I do that to little kids.  You know, they'll come up and go, that was made.  And they go, no, it ain't.  And I go, hey, you just put a scratch on my scratch.  You know, it's pretty cool.  Awesome.  Do you have groupies?  Huh?  I know we got to have break, right?  Do you have groupies?  You know, I have women.  I have groupers.  Women with fish faces.  That's what I have.  LarryTheCableGuy.com.  LarryTheCableGuy.com.  And you got the CD out as well.  What, Morning Constitution?  Morning Constitution is my brand-new CD,  so I hope people go check that out. 
[01:39:00]  And I wanted to just thank you all for having me in, man.  Thanks for always supporting me,  and I'm really happy with all your success.  Well, you're going to return the favor.  You're going to be at one of our shows, right?  Let me tell you something.  Like I said before, well, you know,  I live in Florida six months a year,  and Nebraska six months a year.  So if, you know, if I'm able to do it,  by God, I'd love to.  How cool would that be, though?  Out of nowhere, he just walks on the stage  and does a few minutes.  If he can't make it,  there's another character that I've been working on  called Jim the DirecTV employee.  I'll be happy to chime in. 
[01:39:30]  I've heard of it.  It's been making the waves.  Larry, it's always a pleasure.  You're great, man.  Yeah, thanks a lot.  But you don't need to hear that.  You do ten shows a day.  Three-year arena tour.  Yeah, three years.  How many people, the most you perform in front of?  Live.  Well, the biggest crowd I've done so far.  I'm just asking this question  to really bum him out, by the way.  So, even if it's, you know,  make the number really high.  Well, the biggest crowd I've done so far  was in, oh, man, where was it?  It was in the Georgia-Florida line there. 
[01:40:00]  I can't remember what was that,  but 15,000.  And then, yeah, so that was the big.  Now, the biggest blue collar ever did,  all four of us together.  This was really awesome.  Talk about nervous.  Oh, man.  We did the final rehearsal  before our third movie  at the Gaylord Center in Nashville.  Still hold the record today.  We beat Elton John and Billy Joel.  We did over 21,000.  Oh.  And, dude, it was nerver.  I mean, you shouldn't do comedy. 
[01:40:30]  Walk out in front of 21,000 people.  It really throws your timing off a little bit.  Would you guys revolve closing,  or would you guys have an order that you did set?  No, we had to set, you know.  Well, I think I closed it off,  and Jeff came up and said,  hey, you want to close this show this time?  And he goes, I am sick and tired  of following everybody.  And he had a point, you know,  he's going up,  and we're all doing our best 15 minutes,  and Jeff's got to go up after it. 
[01:41:00]  And he's like,  I ain't following you guys anymore, you know.  And, you know,  he could do it easily,  but he didn't do it.  Right, there you go.  We've got to get you out of here.  He's got to get to Regis.  He's got a car up by.  So it's LarryTheCableGuy.com  to get all your info, basically.  But Delta 4 starts tomorrow.  Delta 4 starts tomorrow.  Go check it out.  Thanks for having me on.  And I've got to do this.  It's in my contract.  Get her done.  Get her done.  There you go.  Larry the Cable Guy.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  You're home for good, clean, wholesome  family entertainment. 
[01:41:30]  That is such a long way to go  just to say  hear what everyone else is talking about. 
[01:42:00]  O&A, uncut, and live,  continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio  starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:42:30]  Once again, I want to thank Larry the Cable Guy  for stopping by.  Of course, after Larry the Cable Guy  left the studio,  we ran right down the hall to see  what was dumped.  Right.  Because he was doing  some of his jokes.  He was doing his jokes?  In front of  tens of thousands of people  that laugh and laugh  and find it hysterically funny.  He's been on a three-year arena tour  doing the exact, 
[01:43:00]  not the exact,  but some of the jokes you heard  on our interview  with him.  None of it contained  any foul language whatsoever.  And we're breaking this  to Jimmy live on the air  because we thought  it would be a lot of fun  to hear Jimmy's  natural reaction.  They dumped out  the Asian material.  Yes.  Just about all of it.  Wait.  Yeah.  They dumped out,  did you have the driving reference?  Pretty much all of it. 
[01:43:30]  I believe, yeah, yeah.  Pretty much all of it.  They dumped out of,  yes.  Yes.  Pretty much all of it.  How infuriating is it?  That's disgusting.  It is.  How can management explain that?  I don't know.  We gotta, we gotta.  See, we argue that we're comedians.  Larry is a comedian.  Yeah.  There's no argument.  That's what he has been doing  for, since 1985.  Get me that crappy  dat fan material.  Wow.  Get me some of that stuff 
[01:44:00]  and just play it.  Can we play that?  Margaret Cho.  Hey, I wanna do a funny,  a five o'clock funnies  at, what, 8.30.  Get some Margaret Cho.  Mm-hmm.  Get some dat fan.  Doing her mother's accent.  All she does.  My mother talking like that.  She wouldn't have an act  if it wasn't  for making fun  of her mother's accent.  I bet that just got dumped out of.  I bet you doing that  just got dumped out of.  Yeah, they're just, uh.  I bet it did.  They're uber sensitive.  It did?  Yeah.  You cannot,  you cannot do  a stereotypical 
[01:44:30]  accent  from any other  ethnic group  without it being  dumped out of.  Wow.  And if,  but if,  if dat fan  or Margaret Cho  came on this program  and did it,  um,  I assume they would  let it fly.  Yeah, it would be fine.  I don't know.  They're basing freedom  of speech on,  um, uh,  ethnicity right now.  I'm just gonna tell you,  I'm embarrassed  for the station.  I'm embarrassed for the,  I'm embarrassed  for this country.  I'm embarrassed  for the Asian listeners  of this radio show. 
[01:45:00]  I'm embarrassed  for Earth.  I'm embarrassed, uh,  for the Asian listeners.  I, I'm sorry,  but this company  has decided  that you can't  handle Asian, uh,  humor.  You can't handle  where, where a joke  might make fun  of an Asian, uh,  stereotype.  I'm sorry.  I have to apologize  to the Asian listeners  that do, uh,  listen to our show  and they do.  And they do.  People on XM  caught it.  Yeah, they did.  So now we have  to take it off the air  and put it right back  on my drive home  where it belongs.  Wow.  Excuse me. 
[01:45:30]  Excuse me.  The fact that a reference  to an Asian person  driving without,  would get dumb,  it's, it's almost,  it's like, it's,  I'm, I'm boggled.  You know what?  That a company  would allow themselves  to be beaten that badly,  uh, uh, by a special  interest group.  I mean, beat, not,  not like victorious,  but beaten like the way  you would, you would  beat a naughty child  or an animal.  To be beaten that badly  by a special interest  group is, is embarrassing. 
[01:46:00]  Isn't it amazing?  That, that is one step  above being called out  by a chicken for doing  the chicken crosses  the road joke.  That, that's, it's that  old and, of a joke  and that silly.  Why?  Let's try this.  Hi, I'm gay.  Hi.  Well, where's the joke?  See it.  Wow.  Well, well, we got a gay voice.  I just did a gay voice. 
[01:46:30]  Well, we got a, we got a big  meeting with the new boss  next week, so we'll, uh,  we'll take it to the top  and see where we can get.  This goes to the top.  Because, I mean, now you're  just insane.  Larry the Cable Guy should be  able to do whatever the hell  he wants with his humor on  our radio show as long as it  doesn't, uh, break any FCC  regulation.  I don't fault Al.  That's as simple as it gets.  Al, uh, has been pretty good  with the dog.  I don't blame Al.  It's coming from a...  I blame Al for just being an  ass.  Wait, can we do a...  Hi, this is Mr. Steinberg. 
[01:47:00]  I'm a Jewish fella.  Well, if...  Why not?  I'm just curious.  Maybe if you did it in a  Jewish accent.  That's the best I can do.  I don't know what that was.  I thought you were doing  Asian again.  No, I don't.  It might have gotten dumped  because he might have  mistaken that for Asian.  No, no, no.  I'm, uh, I'm a Jewish fella.  No.  Are you?  Jews are okay.  Jews are okay.  Um, how y'all doing?  I live in Uptown.  Look at Jimmy. 
[01:47:30]  And then he rock types and  clicks and tries to see if  it got dumped.  They're just Uber, uh,  sensitive to the Asian stuff  right now.  That was okay.  I didn't know it was bad.  It's okay for now, but now  that you told, uh, all the  special interest groups that  it's easy to get to you, of  course, now all the other  groups are going to jump on  board and eventually, uh,  all that stuff you just did  will not be okay.  How about this?  I don't know what that  means.  That was, uh, Swahili or,  or, um, something.  Hey, listen, we'll, we'll 
[01:48:00]  bring it to the top next  week when we have our  meeting.  Homeless Charlie, uh, made  his debut on our show  yesterday.  He, he, he did the, the  homeless shopping spree.  I know you're, I do.  I know.  I'm, I'm, I'm like, we're  just going to have to wait  until we even meet with  Dan Mason and have him  explaining the whole thing  to us.  Yeah.  We fought so hard to get  certain things through  knowing to do and be, I  don't know what to say to  that.  It's really weird as a  comic to have to deal with  that.  It's something that's so  non-offensive and non-vicious 
[01:48:30]  and the intent was so  non-vicious.  Yeah.  But it's funny.  They had no problem with  him parodying a hillbilly  or doing white trash jokes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's fine.  And it should be  acceptable because he's  funny.  Absolutely.  It all should be  acceptable.  Every single thing.  I don't get it, man.  All right.  Listen, let's, let's get  some homeless Charlie on  the air.  People are a little  afraid of Asians.  And we're going to take  a break and then we're  going to get Dr. Ian  Smith in to talk about  the latest Celebrity Fit  Club.  I love Jimmy.  I know.  I'm trying to move on  just because we're going 
[01:49:00]  to get nowhere with this  until we talk to Dan  Mason anyway.  So there's just something  Jimmy does when he's  mad.  It cracks me up.  What is it?  They come in.  He spits on his own  floors.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Did you just spit?  My girlfriend yelled at me  one time because I spit  on the curtains.  Did you?  You know the times I've  walked off when the  crowd doesn't like me  at this comedy cellar  and I'll look at them.  It's kind of the way  Sonny looked at that  photographer.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And I'm not going to spit  so I don't want to be  running in here panicking.  We dumped out of that  material too.  Spitting light effect 
[01:49:30]  cancer jaw Americans.  Drooling Americans.  The seller a lot of  times if they're like  really self-righteous  and babies.  You say, all right,  well, you guys have  been a good crowd.  And you spit on the  stage in front of you  and walk off.  Esty, who runs a  comedy cellar,  wouldn't make eye  contact with you.  She's like, you do  spit on this stage?  She's Israeli.  Oh, no.  That was Israeli,  by the way.  Oh, that was?  I'll announce everyone  just to not offend.  Yeah, just to make  sure you're, all right.  Hey, Homeless Charlie.  Let's do a little  Homeless Charlie, 
[01:50:00]  then we'll take  another break here, okay?  So he was part of  the homeless shopping  spree, but  he kind of like  fell into the crowd,  I think, at that point.  Because we have such  legendary and such  stars.  Yeah, but he's kind  of a standout when  he's solo.  He's more of a solo  act homeless guy  than an ensemble.  And no, I want to  get to this because  it's in the same  vein of what we're  talking about because  Homeless Charlie's a  black guy and he  loves to call himself  the N-word or just 
[01:50:30]  use the N-word like  it's the word the.  Yeah, and the  company told us that  we have to dump  out of that even  or bleep it even  though Charlie is a  black guy saying  this stuff.  But the other  stuff was perfectly  acceptable.  Yeah, but what he  was talking about  was fine.  Yeah.  But the words he  used in between  talking about it  wasn't fine.  Right.  So Homeless Charlie  came by the XM  show yesterday and  a star was born. 
[01:51:00]  He was just outside  the studio all  excited to meet us.  We're like, come on  up, check it out.  And next thing you  know, we just said  hi to the guy and  we're like, wow,  wow, this guy's  going to get huge  from this radio.  So here's Homeless  Charlie.  We were talking  about John Sterling,  the Yankees  baseball announcer  who just has a  unique way of just  doing his dumb  home run calls that  we all hate, most  of us hate.  And here's Charlie  commenting.  Oh, you're from  the homeless shopping.  Yeah.  All right.  John Sterling call. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  It is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  You pussy still  and shut up.  You know, wow.  I think the man  made a good point.  Yes, he did.  He absolutely did.  We got a lot of  This guy is one of  these people who's  not in that situation  because of drugs or  alcohol.  That's what he said  in a board meeting.  We're going to  increase our profits  for the fourth quarter.  You bunch of  f***ing pussies.  And then he was  out the door.  Out.  Just couldn't  hold his tongue.  You're out. 
[01:52:00]  Um.  Hmm.  Who beeped that?  Well, what part  was beeped?  I don't even know  because the whole  beep was in there.  What word was  beeped?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I think it was  the mother.  I think it was  the big, you know,  the big one.  The Yan?  No.  Was it?  What?  Was there an N  in there that was  beeped?  Maybe.  Or an F?  No one's the one  talking.  Not the F that was,  um, you know,  for the, the, um, 
[01:52:30]  Q's.  Not the F that  stands for the Q's  because that's the  new F.  The old F.  The one that  stands for, um,  uh, uh, uh.  Yeah.  There's a new F  word you can't use  that means Q  or a G people  or, uh,  H, H, S's.  No, that wasn't  in there.  It was the old  standby.  Ah, okay.  But I got nervous  because just, 
[01:53:00]  because there's a  use of the word  that's only,  there's a word in  there that can only  be used in a  certain context.  And so that was  getting me nervous  too.  It's very, it's,  it's very nerve  wracking having these  things being played  on air.  I gotta be honest.  Isn't it nerve  wracking?  By the way,  if you're confused  at home,  this is what we  want you to feel,  confusion.  Exactly.  And, and, and to  also show you how  ridiculous this is.  Don't listen to this  going, I don't know,  why, why would you  play this?  I, I can't understand  anything.  It's a, that's the  point. 
[01:53:30]  Listen to this.  Well, uh, he explains,  um, I don't even know  if I want to do this  anymore.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, look at  Dan, Dan's like, oh  my God, I have a good  job.  Oh, I have such a good  job.  And now it's, oh my  God.  No, no, it's all  good.  Uh, homeless Charlie,  uh, explains how he  got homeless.  Okay.  What's your name,  bro?  Charlie.  Charlie.  Charlie.  And what, uh, I, I  forget, forgive me for  forgetting, but, uh, how'd  you end up on the  streets?  They kicked me out the 
[01:54:00]  house.  Some Jew mother.  Wow.  What happened?  You had, uh, some, uh,  Jewish landlord, I guess.  Yeah.  And you wasn't paying  the rent.  Yeah.  Mother.  Ate off.  I think you got your,  um, did you try to  ethnicity is mixed up,  sir.  Did you try to sit down  and talk it out with  them?  You seem like a very  reasonable human.  I called, I called  out shopping up.  He didn't do nothing  for you.  I can't help you today.  Call back tomorrow.  Damn.  He was busy. 
[01:54:30]  He was busy with  someone with maybe a  little cash, right?  Doesn't want to help a  homeless brother out on  the street.  That James Brown  hairdo ham,  mother.  Oh my God.  This is a, I want to  make it perfectly clear.  I love this guy.  This is our black  friend, Charlie.  I love this guy.  This is our subconscious.  That's Charlie.  And they're dumping  out of him saying the  N word, believe it or  not.  We can, we're not  allowed to have that.  Even if a black guy is  saying it now, that's  where we're at. 
[01:55:00]  That's the climate we're  attempting to do a radio  show in.  Wow.  And he's using it in,  you know, whatever  fashion he would want.  It's not, obviously not  hate speech as far as  he's concerned with that  word.  Right.  It is with Jewish  people.  Yeah.  So the company,  he doesn't really  enjoy Jewish people.  Well, they wouldn't  dump out of Jews  because they haven't  complained yet.  Yeah.  Well, when they  complain, then they'll  add that to us.  You know what?  Who would listen?  So, so they wanted  us to dump out of a  black guy saying the  N word, the original  N word, by the way, 
[01:55:30]  because now there's a  new N word, not the  I miss N word.  Right now.  It's known as the  I miss N word.  We're going the old  school N word.  Okay.  Black guys can't say  that on our show  anymore.  But a black guy could  talk about this.  This word makes it  completely silly.  More homeless, Charlie.  You've been on the  streets for how many  years?  I don't.  I've lost count.  Count.  When did the Jew  kick you out of the  apartment?  It was back about,  well, about 96.  96?  Yeah.  And you've been on  the streets since then?  Yeah.  For the most part?  Yeah. 
[01:56:00]  How do you make a  living?  How do you get some  change for what you  need?  Pick up can,  mug old bitches,  it doesn't matter.  They've got to be easy  pickings, right, bro?  Hey, old bitch,  where's she going to  chase your ass down  the street?  What's your technique?  You go with the jab  or a hook?  I hooked a bitch in a  chair like Mike Tyson.  Did you see that video? 
[01:56:30]  Did you see the video of  the mugger working over  the 101-year-old?  He was a pussy.  You can't drop a  100-year-old bitch,  you're a f***ing punk.  See, now, it is fine  for him to talk about  how he walks up to  old ladies and punches  them in the face to  rob them.  Yeah.  But you can't use the  N-word or any other 
[01:57:00]  word.  Yeah.  Because that might  It's offensive.  It's offensive.  I don't want the world.  Oh, my God.  This world we live in  is gone.  You can't allow it to  make you insane because  it's so ridiculous.  You've just got to  openly laugh at it.  Black guy cannot say  the N-word on the radio.  He could talk about  knocking bitches,  old bitches out.  Imus gets fired for  commenting on, in a  comedic way, on the 
[01:57:30]  looks of a basketball  team.  And this content that  this guy is talking  about is heinous.  Yeah.  It is horrible.  He's talking about  punching old ladies in  the face.  Hysterical.  How beautiful.  But it's just an  awful, like, because  it's real.  Yeah.  Well, he continues with  that thought.  By the way, we are in  the way that Canada does  with the racial stuff.  This is the way they  handle racial stuff, too.  So this is where we're  on our way to Canada. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, great.  Yeah, that's the way  they do it.  All racial stuff is  dumped out of and  not tolerated.  Wow.  That's what we're  doing.  It's a wonderful  country.  So you clock them  and then you go  through that person  where they got, like,  dirty tissues in  there.  Yeah, I catch them  on the first of the  month.  Check date.  Check date.  I catch them on  the 15th.  I got, like, cat food  in person.  F*** that s***.  And then on the  other days when you  can't find any old  bitches to mug, it's  Cans, the old  staple.  Isn't that a hack  for a homeless guy, 
[01:58:30]  though?  No, I'm a f***ing  wheelchair, it don't  matter.  I don't discriminate.  F*** it.  Wow.  There's homeless  Charlie.  He don't discriminate.  We got some more  audio from homeless  Charlie.  We'll try to get to  it after the break.  I'll hook that  bitch in her jaw  like Mike Tyson.  What did he say?  I'll mug an old  bitch.  That is one of the  funniest delivered  lines ever.  Oh, yeah.  He's honest, though.  How did the  opening line go?  The question was,  what do you do for  a living? 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, what do you do  to make some money?  Yeah.  He goes, collect cans.  Do we have that?  Collect cans and mug old  bitches.  There's certain lines  that people say in life  that are just like,  that is a funny guy.  Funny guy?  But you understand,  that's the essence  of what a funny guy is.  Right.  You've been on the streets  you've been on the streets  for how many years?  I don't f***.  I've lost count.  F*** count.  When did the Jew  kick you out of the  apartment?  It was back about,  well, about 96.  96?  Yeah.  And you've been on the  streets since then? 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  For the most part?  Yeah.  How do you make a living?  How do you get some  change for what you need?  Pick up can,  mug old bitches,  it doesn't matter.  They gotta be easy  pickings, right, bro?  Hey, old bitch,  where'd she go do?  Chase the ass down  the f***ing street?  What's your technique?  You go with the jab  or a hook?  I hooked a bitch  in a f***ing chair  like Mike Tyson. 
[02:00:00]  Did you see that video?  Did you see the video  of the mugger  working over the  101-year-old?  He was a pussy.  If you can't drop  a hundred-year-old bitch,  you're a f***ing punk.  If you can't drop  a hundred-year-old bitch,  that is a poem,  comedically.  The wording in that  is poetry.  I guess we gotta  explain to everyone  that we were outraged  like everyone else  when the old lady  got...  Oh, outraged.  You can't drop 
[02:00:30]  a hundred-year-old bitch.  I'm gonna make that  perfectly clear  so no one confuses me.  That,  the content of that  is fine.  He's great.  But the words  that he uses  aren't.  That's how ridiculous  it has become.  Wow.  Dr. Ian Smith  to talk about  the latest  Celebrity Fit Club.  Dustin Diamond  is a doozy  on that show.  We'll see what  that's all about.  Does he hear you?  Yeah, he's in the green room.  We'll talk to him next.  We haven't seen him  in a while.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony virus. 
[02:01:00]  You're checking out  the Opie and Anthony show.  Pittsburgh chill.  Don't dump out of stuff  that we're not dumping out of.  Oh, my God.  It's getting harder  and harder to get ratings  with this radio show.  I don't think we'll ever  have the ratings  we used to have  because the rules  are just getting  so ridiculous.  Our hands are tied  behind our backs.  What did Pittsburgh  dump out of?  Supposedly,  they dumped out  the P word  during the 
[02:01:30]  Homeless Charlie bit.  Everyone just losing  their minds  all over the country.  Which one is that?  You know,  the Poo-ha.  Oh.  Don't be a Poo-ha.  Gotcha.  Like a scared little  scared little one.  And then, you know,  a ratings trend  will come out  and everyone  will look at it  and it's like,  ah, ah, ah, ah.  We know what  the problem is.  Let us do our show  and we'll give you  unbelievable ratings.  Trust me.  We have a fine track record 
[02:02:00]  as far as that goes.  Yes, we do.  I'm not talking  out of turn.  Poker, Anthony.  We're doing this  in Atlantic City.  Maybe we should just  play poker every morning  on the show.  That's right.  It's safe.  No, no.  That would offend  compulsive gambling  Americans.  Right, right.  True.  They would just nibble  and people would collapse.  Yeah.  Anyway, registration.  You can hear my voice.  I'm just a beaten man today.  We've been beaten  once again  with this radio show.  Registration taking place  in the House of Blues  themed poker room  at Showboat  down there  in Atlantic City  from now until 
[02:02:30]  May 18th.  Day of event registration  will take place  in the New Orleans  ballroom beginning  at 9 a.m.  Spots are limited  so register early.  Also an official party  at Club Worship  in the House of Blues  at 10 p.m.  See, I want to be excited  about doing radio.  I really do.  But it gets downright depressing  when this crap  is going on around us.  Larry the Cable Guy  can't do his Asian material  on our radio show  even though he does it  across America  in arenas?  Are you crazy?  I think there are more people  enjoying what he does  than complaining about it. 
[02:03:00]  And you want to talk  about Out of Touch.  Tell these special interest groups  to just go away.  He's one of the biggest  comics in the country.  He is on a three-year  arena tour  and yet  somebody's thinking  well that's offensive.  It's embarrassing man.  It's embarrassing  on a really weird level.  Could you imagine  getting his audience  which is giant  to get motivated  and actually protest  in front of a building  like 10 people do  when they have a problem  with something  and they have to 
[02:03:30]  they drag 10 people  out with them  and march around a building  and everyone folds.  Yeah.  Imagine 10,000 people  marching around a building  how quickly a company  would go  what do you want?  Yeah.  We'll give you anything.  And I love the fact  that no corporate guys  will ever just be honest  publicly like  and this is in any business.  Margaret Cho  could come out  and do any material  she wanted to do  and it's obviously  because of her ethnicity  and yet you would never  get them just to honestly  put that into policy.  Why aren't you just men? 
[02:04:00]  And this is all  corporate business.  None of them want to act  like men  and just be honest.  None of them.  The last 40 minutes  have been just  downright depressing  because then we're like  all right we'll move on  we'll move on  because we're going to be  talking to the new boss  next week  so we try to play  Charlie the Homeless Guy  and it's beeped to crap  to begin with  stuff that shouldn't be beeped  that has nothing to do  with the FCC  and then  that's not good enough  now they're dumping out  of the beeped bit  the beeped part.  So why do we even play  that track  because it meant nothing  to people that 
[02:04:30]  heard it I guess  in Pittsburgh  supposedly they dumped out of it  and maybe other cities  so the P word  I think what happened  is they had to dump  because the beeps  worked out in a certain way  that in Morse code  spelt the S word  so  oh man  the new rules  is like  very hard to understand  like trigonometry  and I didn't  I didn't do well  with trigonometry  so we're effed  by the way  so House of Blues  yeah we're doing  the whatever 
[02:05:00]  after party  club worship  oh it'll be great  see this is what's  really important  in radio  make sure you get  the sponsors  plugs read  for details  on the torment  we're doing  a week from Saturday  torment  that's kind of  you said  for details  on the torment  oh  did I say torment  I can see how  that could slip out  though  sorry  I certainly agree  with you  don't even correct it  you're right bro  for all the details  on the torment  that we're going through  whatever 
[02:05:30]  go to  onapoker.com  it's a week from Saturday  but you're not allowed  to plug websites  you're allowed to  if it makes money  for the company  oh cool  Dr. Ian Smith  been a while  how you doing  what's up fellas  good to see you guys  Dr. Ian Smith  I gotta tell you  I thought I was done  with Celebrity Fit Club  I really thought  that I was done  because you know  it's the same old  same old  in my little world  but then I watched  the new season  I'm like hooked again  I gotta tell you  Dustin Diamond  is the biggest  a-hole ever  can I tell you something  I just was talking  to Harvey yesterday  and Harvey was like 
[02:06:00]  Doc  all the guys  that come on  who are crazy  are on drugs  you know  Jeff Conway  the Baldwin guy  he said  this is the first time  we had a psycho  on the show  who was sober  like the guy's not anything  he's just acting stupid  we had him on our show  we hated him  years ago  they still debate this  the fans do  who was the worst guest  on the opening  anthony show ever  and Dustin Diamond  comes up with a guy  that made balloon animals  on our show  it kind of is a toss up  but most people  would definitely say  Dustin Diamond  he's out of his 
[02:06:30]  he's delusional  he's out of his mind  like he goes on  Celebrity Fit Club  to quote lose weight  but I think he wants  a little bit of publicity  and he refuses  to follow your diet  he refuses to do  the workouts  when they're not  doing the show  and they have video  of him just eating  all sorts of fried food  while he's on the road  doing his comedy  and burgers and stuff  his comedy  first of all  he's a comedian  Dustin Diamond  you hear the stuff  he does  I'm like  I'm better than that  it's horrible  his comedy is god awful  it's awful  but here's the thing 
[02:07:00]  the guy comes on  my unprofessional opinion  he's awful too  the guy comes on the show  and the first thing  he says to me  on the scale  the first encounter  is I'm not going to  follow the fat smash diet  I'm going to eat  whatever I want  and prove to America  you can eat cheeseburgers  and pizza  and lose weight  so what am I supposed  to say to that  oh good  I mean I'm the diet guy  you know what  but god bless you guys  that makes good TV  I don't give a crap  about these people personally  it makes good TV  and when they got the video  Dustin Diamond  trashing everyone  behind the scenes  and then last night 
[02:07:30]  I finally got the  latest episode in  and they played the video  of Dustin Diamond  saying just horrific things  about everybody else  but he doesn't say it  to Warren G  you notice  you notice that right  what a whip  but he takes on the women  Kimberly Locke  I tell you what  Kimberly Locke  who lost on  American Idol season 2  or whatever  and Clay Aiken  and he basically says  look she's fat  she'll always be fat  that's the reality  of what she has to deal with  she'll lose her  and just went after all of them  it made for great TV  because then they played 
[02:08:00]  in front of these people  and there's Dustin Diamond  like  can I tell you something  though you know what  he  this guy  listen  if you talk that smack  to people  listen  I'm good with that  but do it behind their backs  and when you're in their face  he gets all scared  like Debrat  oh my goodness  you know Debrat  you know Debrat's  hip hop  gangsta  blah blah blah  she was getting ready  to smash him  right in his face  and you know  I gotta be impartial  so I'm sitting there saying  you know  you guys shouldn't do that  meanwhile I'm like  go get him  go get him  of course you're home for that  I'm like  oh go get him 
[02:08:30]  but you know  it sucks  and it's frustrating  so he says  all these awful things  and then someone said  and Dustin  you know you said worse  but I guess  they couldn't show that  on TV  oh really  that's what I need to know  give us some inside scoop here  we're doing an outtake  but I mean  he was talking about  like Cletus  the country western guy  who is insane  he's crazy  I agree with Dustin Diamond  I can't go into a supermarket  he has a phobia of supermarkets  because he used to be  a big fat guy  then lost weights  and then he was like  anorexic or something 
[02:09:00]  but now he's on the show  to lose weight  I'm beyond confused  with this guy  and he can't go into  a supermarket  and he had to have  a therapist  this guy's a  you know  an edgy comic  and he agreed  to allow a therapist  who no offense  I mean  therapist  and she's in the supermarket  walking him through  his supermarket experience  to get him over  his fear of freaking food  in a supermarket  did she take him  down the douche aisle 
[02:09:30]  and say this  is what you are  but anyway  what were you  oh but anyway  so he just  he starts riffing  on Cletus  you know  Cletus like did this  I don't know  country western music  but he's a big guy  in country western  everyone knows him  and Cletus  he parodies  country western songs  right  that's what he did  exactly  so Cletus  has all these phobias  you know  he can't fly  he can't buy  stuff in grocery stores  he just rips  on this guy  I mean  calls him all kinds  of names  calls his daughter  he's got a two year old  kid who's separated  from his wife  he just gets really 
[02:10:00]  it's okay to go  after somebody  but then when you start  going after their family  come on  yeah  there's a line  so anyway  Cletus just almost  episode 5  and episode 8  are arguably  two of the best  really  episodes in the history  of celebrity fiction  yeah I'm definitely hooked  I mean Dustin quit  the show yesterday  but I was like  yeah alright  you're gonna quit  the show  he obviously  wants the attention  you know  or he would've never  put out that dumb  porn video  and try to sell  dumb t-shirts  on his website  so I knew that  who would buy 
[02:10:30]  a porn video  of Dustin Diamond  I don't know  apparently nobody  no one really  I don't know  he's a bigger boy  than you'd imagine  yeah that's what I heard  and I hear he's got  some of that karate  in him right  yeah right  I hear he's got  a little martial arts  but he did beat up  Arnold Horschach  Ron Polillo  in celebrity boxing  if you recall  oh yeah  years ago  he did beat up  a man twice his age  half his size  half his size  that looked like a veal  yeah 
[02:11:00]  he didn't have  a hint of muscle  Ron looks like  his last name  yeah  he's like  Polillo  I'm sorry  you have Polillo  who left this  pile of Polillo  in my white shag rug  you got some  you got a good cast  they're all  they're all  really strange man  you know who's the coolest  so Warren G  Warren G just doesn't  do anything  Warren G just  I shouldn't say all  he seems  he just  he just hangs out  he just loses his weight  yeah  what's up y'all  he's all like this  he's friends with Snoop  yeah but like  Marsha Brady's crying  because she lost

[02:15:00]  Thank you. 
[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  Thank you. 
[02:17:30]  Thank you.  Are we going to have to do the show from over there?  Probably.  They were supposed to have this done.  They were supposed to do this when we went away for two weeks.  Wouldn't that be funny if they tell us?  But we made some last-minute changes.  Wouldn't that be great if they tell us we can't say certain things just because we're in the building? 
[02:18:00]  Are we doing it from D.C.?  I don't know.  Well, yeah, for a day or two.  This build-out is going to take weeks.  It's going to take weeks.  They said months?  Let me tell you something.  When they say weeks, it means months.  Contractors got to get a little over-ejection.  Yeah, I will tell you.  You know, let me tell you something.  Under the current situation, hours will seem like days.  She was in Captain Kirk code. 
[02:18:30]  I like that, yes.  He gave to Spock.  We're going to have robotic cameras and glass walls.  Oh, you guys are getting high, society.  In a lounge area, so if we're feeling really lazy, we can just kind of hang out on couches and do our show.  And then we're going to have an area for bands and stuff.  It's going to be all glass walled.  And we might even bring in a giant scale to make you feel at home.  You guys need to be on TV.  I'm serious.  Well, we've been trying.  It would be great.  There's a, well, there's somebody that wants us really bad, but their idea sucks. 
[02:19:00]  And they will not take no for an answer.  So I guess eventually you'll see us on TV doing this really bad show.  Yeah, because we're always good at folding after being asked 18 times to do something we don't want to do.  No, we don't want to do it.  Don't want to do it.  Don't want to do it.  All right, we'll do it.  Shut up.  The idea is jackass with lawsuits, basically.  Yep, that's pretty much it.  Jackass with the inability to defend ourselves from lawsuits.  It's jackass meets Mythbusters. 
[02:19:30]  You know, the faithful listeners know we talk about this from time to time.  They will not take no for an answer.  So eventually we'll just say, all right.  All right, we'll do it.  Drop a car on that school.  Go ahead.  Oh, we've killed some children.  That's going to cost us.  Just get in the door.  Say yes, whatever they freaking want.  Then do what you do.  I want an animation show.  An animated show.  Yeah, a cartoon.  Because some of the animations that we showed in Vegas went over huge.  We're going to do it part of the O&A Traveling the Virus comedy tour. 
[02:20:00]  They animate our bits, and they're hilarious.  And I know the idea isn't the most original,  but I think we could throw our own little spin on it.  I think it would be huge.  Like Jimmy told a childhood story, and they animated it.  It's beyond funny when you see the animation.  They're like everyone's doing animation now.  I'd say a quick half hour, maybe VH1,  and maybe our actual faces setting up stuff,  and we're good to go.  You know how those commercials they do where it looks like it's the person,  but it's not the person, but they, I don't know what you call it. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, they kind of animate it a little.  It looks like a...  Yeah, that would...  What's it called?  It's done with them computers.  I believe it's rotoscoping.  What?  Rotoscoping.  That's what that's called.  Rotoscoping is kind of cutting something out of a scene.  Boy genius.  Like if you take a film clip and you cut some guy out of the background of it  and stick him somewhere else, that's rotoscoping.  It's almost like screen screening, but without the green screen.  Okay. 
[02:21:00]  But what?  Uh-oh.  You got the mic back.  By the way, Ian, we blew up Than's spot.  Than's ready.  What?  Well, the...  I want to hear what he was going to say.  Just the rotoscoping thing.  Yeah?  Is an animation technique in which animators trace over live action.  Oh, okay.  Then it is tracing.  But you're reading that.  But I had the right answer beforehand.  I just need my internet to back it up.  He's just backing up.  Okay.  No, same principle.  It's the tracing part.  Okay.  Anyway, you got...  Dan secretly hates us. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, really?  We blew up his spot.  He was supposed to be in a Super Bowl commercial.  Oh.  I think I'm in his real spot.  The, uh...  When he broke down like the colonel.  No, no.  They're just so cute when they're young.  I just...  I just like to...  I don't touch them.  I just look at them and take pictures.  Are you looking at a porno while we're trying to do our...  I'm just depressed.  A porn magazine?  Why are you depressed?  That'll fuck him up.  He'll look through that hustler.  His energy level is a little down, though.  What's up, man?  What's up?  I just did a weird thing with my girlfriend last night. 
[02:22:00]  I just slept for an hour or so.  Oh, no.  No, no.  Not a big fight.  Just like weirdly...  Scrabble?  You got a weird thing happening almost weekly with her, though.  Yeah.  I'm not used to intimacy, man.  Yeah.  What was the weird thing?  Oh, the intimacy thing?  Usually I will.  And you got a doctor in here.  He's a doctor of everything.  I call him with all sorts of dumb questions.  Yes, talk to Dr. Dean.  This one I can't.  This one I can't.  But I will eventually, but I...  You wanted a brunette.  She wanted a redhead.  I wish that was the problem.  No.  I wanted monogamy, and she wanted black. 
[02:22:30]  No, I'm kidding.  It wasn't something like that.  It was just a weird thing, man.  Once you go black, you don't go back.  That's what frightens me.  That's what frightens me.  What makes that up?  That's so stupid.  Once you go Jim Norton, you don't come back.  A little mediocre fucking lover I am.  By the way, we do have a...  All right, we'll move on.  Jimmy will share when he's ready.  Yeah.  Maybe he'll share this weekend at Caroline's.  Look at him.  He just smiled.  He went, I know I'm going to be at Caroline's all weekend.  And by the way, I hope the pests get the word out that, you know, you heard it yourself. 
[02:23:00]  Larry the Cable Guy is doing one of our tour dates this summer.  Oh, boy.  It's going to be a surprise, so you're going to have to buy tickets for all of them just  to make sure you're at the one he shows up at.  Right.  Let's make sure we get the word out that you heard it.  Larry the Cable Guy said he would do it if he was in the area.  Did he?  Yes, he did.  Oh, okay.  We have the tape.  We have a doctor in studio from Celebrity Fit Club, Dr. Ian Smith.  Come on, you pests.  Give me some questions.  Really?  You want to do that? 
[02:23:30]  Pestuses.  Well, there's something coming in on the instant feedback.  Holy shit, guys.  Check out this link.  Oral sex causes throat cancer.  Just got this today.  I don't think I want to read this.  I don't either.  Why do we want to blow up this spot?  Oh, we have it?  Yes, this is from Medical News Today.  I don't know what kind of article this is.  I don't put any credence in this whatsoever.  Do they have credibility, this medical news today?  Oh, poppycock.  And apparently if you're popping enough cocks in your mouth, you're going to get throat cancer. 
[02:24:00]  Oral sex increases throat cancer risk, scientists say.  I'd say faggot scientists.  Shouldn't it be doctors say instead of scientists say?  No, doctors.  No, married guys say.  First three lines are exactly what this article is.  See, these guys kill me.  You look at that headline, oral sex increases throat cancer risk, scientists say.  So you're thinking, what, me just doing my thing?  It's not.  You know what it is?  They're saying if you have more than one partner, a lot of partners, the likelihood that somebody has some type of virus is high. 
[02:24:30]  So it increases your risk for throat cancer.  Okay.  But that's like a no-brainer.  Of course.  If you have like 100 sexual partners, sooner or later you're going to run to someone who probably has a virus.  So pretty much you're saying, like, if you drive more than other people, your chances of getting into a car accident go up.  Sooner or later it's going to happen.  So this is-  The more cocks you got in your mouth, the more chance one's going to be diseased.  I almost yelled out the luckier you are.  You can tell he's depressed. 
[02:25:00]  Anthony taught me about stats.  See, you got to work your way around stats.  Yeah, you got to do.  Now this is just-  Everyone today is talking about this.  This is exactly what they wanted to do.  And it just is-  I could have written this article before I went to medical school.  Get out of here.  It says patients who have had a lifetime number of six or more oral sex partners were 3.4 times more likely to have oropharyngeal cancer.  How is that pronounced? 
[02:25:30]  Oropharyngeal.  Let me get a shot.  Throat cancer.  I'm going to go with oropharyngeal.  Throat cancer.  And then those who had 26 or more vaginal sex partners during their lifetime were 3.1 times more likely to have that type of cancer.  Oropharyngeal cancer.  The human papilloma.  The running of the bulls in Pampelona.  That's where they got to scoop your box out with a radiation shovel. 
[02:26:00]  This article is like no clue.  I was hoping you were going to say ice cream scooper.  But it's going to work.  Freaking in the shovel.  Jesus.  That's great.  And then it says the link became stronger as the number of lifetime oral and vaginal sex partners went up.  Well, that's exactly what you were saying.  Get out of here.  It's ridiculous.  It's a waste.  It's a waste.  I'll tell you what, though.  I want to burn some freaking calories.  Now you're talking.  Well, before you did that, did you read the other article?  It also said that having multiple oral sex partners increases fun. 
[02:26:30]  Increases fun.  Just increases fun.  Really?  With each oral sex instance, the fun went up.  And there's also a really weird correlation between people who have given a lot of oral sex and gum purchases in certain areas.  Breath mints.  Do you know that women who give head to their husbands are five times more likely to have to kiss him on the cheek?  Fucking stupid.  Hey, bring in E-Rock. 
[02:27:00]  You know, the less oral sex a woman gives, the more prone she is to black eyes.  There you go.  Hey, Dr. Ian Smith, what can you do to help this disaster?  Oh, we've learned recently, Eric here, E-Rock.  We got an expert, E-Rock.  He's going to help you.  He's at his heaviest that he's been since he's been here.  And we used to call him heavy.  How tall are you, man?  I'm being polite.  How tall are you?  5'11".  How much do you weigh? 
[02:27:30]  2.23.  So he's 5'10", and he weighs 2.30.  Uh-oh, Ian's going to his book.  Extreme Fat Smash Diet.  Holy cow, dude.  You're obese.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  No, I'm serious.  You're going to look at a book to see that?  No, but I want to make sure his number, your BMI is 31.5.  What is it again?  His BMI is 31.5.  You're obese.  You're not, like, overweight.  You're obese.  You're obese.  Oh, great.  Dude, you're obese.  Look at Travis.  Oh, and Danny just laughing.  You qualify. 
[02:28:00]  He falls into the obese range?  His BMI is greater than freaking 30.  What the freaking mean?  What's a BMI?  Body mass index.  It's like the new fang-dangled way of figuring out if you're overweight or not.  Holy shit.  You're obese.  What page are you on?  I have to see.  Page 206.  Yeah, pass out your book.  We all got to do it.  You know what?  Obese.  Extreme Fat Smash Diet.  Right after that comes a fucking forklift out of the side of your house because you can't move.  Page 86?  Page 206.  Oh, true.  It's the BMI chart.  He's 5'11", 223.  He's freaking 31. 
[02:28:30]  He's not 5'11", though.  You're not 5'11".  Oh, my God.  You're even more obese than you thought.  You're not 5'11".  You're 5'10".  Stand up straight.  We have to take the hat off.  Sam, how tall are you?  5'9".  All right.  Back to back.  So let's even go better.  He might be 5'11".  He's 5'11".  He might be 5'11".  He's 5'11".  Harry's 6'3".  Wait.  I saw what you did.  Oh, my God.  He went up on his tippy toes.  They walked away, and you dropped down about a half a foot.  Yep, you did.  And don't tilt your head backwards.  Yeah, just put your chin down. 
[02:29:00]  Put your chin down.  What's left of it.  I don't know.  All right, all right.  All right.  We'll give you 5'10".  It doesn't matter.  You're still freaking obese.  I mean, no one's great.  Dr. Ian Smith, you know, he's one of the nicer guests we have on this show.  Yeah, and he's calling you freaking obese.  He's just being accurate.  You're two clicks into obesity.  Really?  Yeah, he's two clicks into obesity.  Not even one, just he's two clicks.  He's two clicks.  Wait.  How do you get the two clicks?  What's before obese?  Overweight.  Overweight. 
[02:29:30]  Overweight.  But you guys aren't here.  Okay, let's do O's.  O's, how tall are you?  Me?  Yeah.  Well, I like to think I'm six foot.  We'll give you six.  No, I'm about.  I'll take 5'11".  Okay, 5'11".  How much?  These days, about just under 170.  Dude, you're right in the heart of healthy.  Yeah, but I'll.  You see it?  You're 160.  So, okay, so you're one.  I want to be 162.  No, but look at your BMI.  You're at 23.5. 
[02:30:00]  My body movement.  No, no.  Take.  Go on the left side.  Find the chart.  Take your height.  All right, yeah.  Go across.  Find your weight.  Yeah.  Closest to your weight.  And go up.  That should be my number.  20, between 23 and 24.  Yeah.  So, what does that mean?  Then go down.  Oh, my God.  Math?  No, no, no.  No, no.  Math?  Oh, I see over here.  Yeah, but I'm close to overweight.  25 starts to be overweight.  25.  It takes a lot to get to 25.  What is a healthy weight for 5'11"?  Seriously.  You're healthy, but trying to figure out the scale. 
[02:30:30]  There's another scale, and you fall into imbecile.  Oh, you're completely...  I'm going to lose 5 pounds.  I mean, 5 pounds won't hurt you, but you don't need to lose 5 pounds.  All right.  What about me?  Okay, where are you?  I'm 5'10 and a half.  That's why I don't think you're 5'11".  No, you're not.  Yeah, I am.  I'm taller than you.  I know.  I didn't say 6'10 and a half.  Oh, so I'm 6'10".  Oh, so you're helping me get to 6 foot.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm 6 foot.  All right.  How much do you weigh?  Uh, 155.  Perfect.  I'm pretty light. 
[02:31:00]  You're perfect.  You're right.  Goodie.  You're square dab in the middle of it.  Perfect in every way.  Thank you.  What about Jimmy?  All right.  I don't know, because that just said I'm one.  How much do you take off of clothes?  That's not completely accurate.  If Iraq was wearing a suit of armor, he'd still be obese.  No, that just weighed me in at 165, and I'm not 160.  I'm lighter than 160.  I know I'm lighter than 160.  Oh, yeah?  Okay.  Yeah, probably about, I'm going to say 155.  Okay.  So I'm overweight.  And how tall are you?  I want to say 5'7".  5'6 and a half, 5'7".  It says overweight. 
[02:31:30]  That's fine.  I'm going to lose 10 more pounds.  That's insane.  How is Jimmy overweight?  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  5'6", you said?  You're 5'7".  5'7", 155.  He's just in the overweight category.  Just about, yes.  So how is he?  No, you're not.  What are you guys looking at?  5'7", 155.  What's wrong with you guys?  24 to 25, I see.  Right, but 24.9 is...  Just before overweight.  Yeah, so he's still in the healthy weight.  He's in the upper range of health.  Barely.  You could drop.  Yeah, I should.  You could drop.  That's correct.  Three pounds and you're done.  No, but I'm a legit idiot. 
[02:32:00]  I've got to tone up more.  I want to lose like another 10 pounds.  All right, why are you taking the focus off Iraq?  Yeah, yeah, sir.  Iraq, come on dude, stand up.  Iraq, when he started, his lightest for the show is 180?  193.  193, I'm sorry.  You gained 30 pounds?  30, 31 pounds he's up to.  Doing freaking what?  Nothing.  That's an answer right there.  He likes mayo.  He likes condiments.  Do you work out? 
[02:32:30]  Does he work out?  No, I wasn't really good.  Just say no.  No.  Same reason.  You got a girl?  Yeah.  And she's like, when you get naked, she's cool with that.  Oh, God.  No, no, no.  I'm on XM Radio.  I can't do this on Sluby Fit Club.  I can do it here.  What the?  Seriously.  No, shit.  You know what?  Hold on.  Some guy yesterday, I'm doing this photo shoot, and this photographer, who's totally in my  face, he's totally want to talk diet stuff.  I don't want to talk diet stuff.  And the guy says, he has this huge beer gut. 
[02:33:00]  He pounds it and says, what do you think, doc?  I'm like, dude, have you seen yourself in the shower?  What do you mean?  What do I think?  Like, you look awful.  Don't ask me.  We all know what we have to do.  And we still will ask a doctor or whatever.  What do you think?  What do you think?  Well, you already know.  I told him you're a fat slob.  I told him that.  I didn't know the guy.  I just felt so pissed off that day.  I'm like, you're a fat slob.  You sleep, women sleep with you like that?  Anyway.  Anyway, back to your father.  A marvelous segue back into Eric. 
[02:33:30]  How's your girlfriend when you're naked?  She hasn't really said anything, but she doesn't.  But you can tell, right?  Yeah, I can kind of tell.  But a vagina has a tumbleweed blowing across.  Oh, no.  You can tell?  What are the signs?  What do you see?  There's sometimes she goes, maybe I should be cooking dinner tonight.  And then she's the one that pretty much is kicking my ass to me.  Is she a good weight?  You got a picture of her?  Yeah, she's all right, man.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:34:00]  What little hints?  Like when you say, did you come?  Does she go, ugh?  Lights on or off?  Both.  Oh, you little freak.  Doggy style, they're on.  Her on the bottom, him on top, off.  Don't turn around.  They have a clapper, too, so she doesn't have to look at him.  Turn around, all right.  When are they on and when are they off?  Well, obviously at night it's off, but sometimes in the afternoon. 
[02:34:30]  So you're talking the sun?  What are they on?  When he's at the refrigerator.  Oh, E-Rock.  So what do you think, Dr. Ian?  I think, dude, you got to lose at least 20 pounds.  Seriously.  Come on, what could get you to lose 20 pounds?  His cholesterol is high already, too.  We learned that, right?  Well, it's back down now.  It's back down.  When was the last time you had a check?  Shortly before Christmas was the last time I had a check. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, boy.  How old are you?  How old are you?  I don't know.  How old are you?  29.  Dude.  You're a train wreck.  Dude.  Oh, God.  No, no.  I mean, I don't mean to sound insensitive, but seriously.  I'm tired of, like, cuddling people and talking softly.  I'm just going to talk straight.  Let's just come man up with you.  You're a train wreck, dude.  You're 29.  You're obese.  You got a cute girl.  Some guy, some stud's going to walk.  She's going to be walking down the street.  Some good-looking dude is going to give her a little eye.  She's going to give a little eye. 
[02:35:30]  And then your history, then you're going to be one of those guys who tries to kill the girl, kill the guy.  I see it playing over and over.  Just stop it now.  Lose 20 pounds.  What's the incentive?  What's the deal?  You and I make a bet.  Let's come on right now.  Okay.  One-on-one, 20 pounds.  I say you can lose on extreme fat.  You got to do extreme, by the way.  This is 12 pounds in three weeks.  I say if you follow extreme fat smash, you could lose 20 pounds in seven weeks.  Less than two months. 
[02:36:00]  Less than two months.  You should do it for your chick.  If you do it.  Do it for your chick.  What do I give him?  If you do it.  A burger.  And then watch him gain it all back.  Okay.  You know what?  If you do it, $500.  Whoa.  From you?  From me, cash.  Hey, look at that.  In fact, I'll give you the $500 now.  You hold the $100 to $500.  You want it now?  Oh, man.  But if you don't have it and you don't lose the weight, that's good enough.  He gets people to bust your fucking legs.  Let me tell you something now.  Damn, man.  Don't let the nice articulation fool you. 
[02:36:30]  I'm still a brother.  You don't come back with my money.  This is your incentive.  I'm serious.  Damn.  He's got fat smash diet money on him.  Hey, can I hold some?  I'll lose.  I'll go out and get AIDS.  I'll drop it immediately.  $500.  Okay.  You lose it, you keep it.  Okay.  Okay?  20 pounds.  I'm not fooling around with you, man.  Oh, my God.  You're actually going to get his ass kicked.  I love this.  If you don't do it, you get my $500 back plus $100. 
[02:37:00]  Ah.  See?  See?  Fair?  Ian's just trying to make $100.  Yeah, this is so easy, man.  This is a short thing.  He knows so many people and how they lose weight.  That's what he does.  That's why he's got a wallet filled with hundreds.  He looked at Iraq and said, there's no fucking way this guy can lose weight.  I got this in the bag.  I can make $100.  That's why he's got the wallet filled with hundreds.  That five is five motherfuckers walking around going, shit, I lost $100.  I can't believe I fell for that scam. 
[02:37:30]  This is great.  What do you say, Iraq?  This is better than the Nigerian scam that's going around.  Right, right, right, right.  Good one.  That's my cousin, by the way, doing it.  Okay.  I give you the $500 now.  You have the time to lose it.  Okay?  What do we say?  Seven weeks.  By the middle of the summer, you'll be fine.  Seven weeks starting today.  No.  Let's get an exact...  I need an exact date.  And I need a weight right now.  Yep.  Yep.  Get that scale in here.  Same scale, so it doesn't matter what the fuck it is.  By the way, it says obese sex bagel on the pad data. 
[02:38:00]  Can you...  Oh, no.  You should strip down to your...  Honestly, to get a real weight, you should strip down to your t-shirt.  Leave your underwear on and your socks.  But I would strip down to my fucking underwear.  That's how I got weighed last time.  And I would not put an extra pound on with my dumb sneakers.  Underpants and t-shirt.  Let's go.  Lose the hat.  And the big fout.  Shirt.  At least this segment's starting to get sexy.  Absolutely.  What the hell is in that wallet?  Is that wallet?  Look at this.  Fucking cheeseburger.  Even his wallet has to be fat. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, cow.  Yeah, you need...  You got a book for that wallet?  It's like your granddaddy.  Like your grandfather.  You know, your grandfather's paper should fall in.  All right, we're on to a new thing.  What the fuck is...  You can carry around in that wallet?  You can't be that important.  What...  Seriously, what is all that?  Is it all credit cards?  I.D.s, credit cards.  I.D.s.  How many do you have, Mohamed Atta? 
[02:39:00]  License, insurance, SMCBS.  Look, this is my wallet, and I feel like this is too fat.  And as you can see, my wallet is a rubber band.  Yeah, rubber bands.  That's how I hold a lot of cash in it.  A lot of money will fit in that wallet.  You just hold five, Eric.  All right, we're figuring out what seven weeks are.  And we're also going to get you on a scale now.  June 28th.  June 28th won't be the day.  June 28th won't be the day.  What day of the week is that?  That's Thursday.  Perfect.  So write it in your little planner that you've got to at least call the show or come by.  Yeah.  All right.  June 28th.  All right, E-Rock is disrobing. 
[02:39:30]  Did you get Wade with that wallet every time?  Oh, wow.  Watch him be 140 now.  What the hell is in there?  Take that tablecloth off.  Nothing?  All right.  I was watching him take it off.  I want to fucking sit patio furniture around that awful shirt.  Swing and miss twice.  I know.  I'm still trying to think of jokes about the wallet.  Well, I like it.  Oh, wow. 
[02:40:00]  I like this Pete who's, you know, helping us out.  Helping us.  He's promoting the ONA Traveling Virus Comedy Tour.  Traveling Virus.  He wants to add a little more incentive.  Oh.  All right.  I know what it is.  The incentive is this.  If E-Rock doesn't lose the weight, not only does he have to give your money back, Dr.  James Smith, and $100, Pete wants him to be on stage in just your underpants.  Oh, I like.  An ONA Traveling Virus.  He suggests Jones Beach, but this contest ends after Jones Beach there, Pete, so it'll 
[02:40:30]  have to be another tour date.  Maybe Jersey.  First of all, come on.  Come on.  What are you doing?  Take your pants off.  Get on the scale.  And you have to skip around the stage from there going, tee hee hee hee hee hee.  All right.  Listen.  All right.  This is another observation.  What the?  The fun never ends.  It looks like you've been cooking chicken bullion in your armpits.  Lift up the other arm.  Dude, he's got a white t-shirt on for everybody at home. 
[02:41:00]  I've never seen yellower armpits.  Oh, my God.  It's urine stained.  Although your armpits are your cunts.  What is that, E-Rock?  What's going on, E-Rock?  What is up with your...  Your girl...  First of all, I'm not pissing at your girl now.  Now I'm pissing at your girl.  Now I'm pissing at your girl.  Because what the freak?  She's not telling you...  Dude, what is up with that?  She's throwing those away.  Why is it yellow, though?  Yeah, what is that?  What is that?  What's with the...  It's pretty dark yellow stains under his white. 
[02:41:30]  You're fucking sweating Dijonais.  Yeah, he's certainly sweating condiments at this point.  Very good.  I can't see this.  I'm a hygiene freak.  I can't see that.  Lift him up.  Hold on.  Lift him up.  I can't see him.  You're obese.  You know, Dr. Ian...  You're a train wreck.  Eric, he's disgusted with you.  I've got this one.  Every sweatshirt I own.  Every t-shirt I own.  Yeah, lift him...  Hands in the air.  Oh, my God.  What, um...  Oh, shit. 
[02:42:00]  We're doing it for Pal Talk.  Even with the bad Pal Talk camera, they could see it.  Oh, God.  I've got to punch up O-Ban 2 to take a look at it.  It's just yellow pits.  I am...  Really yellow.  Yeah, stunned by that.  Wow.  Why, Y-Rock?  Why?  I don't know.  I didn't create this, like, on purpose.  Okay, Y-Rock.  You have a supernova under your arms.  Y-Rock.  First of all...  First of all...  Like we do on Celebrity Fit Club. 
[02:42:30]  Please take off your pants and please step on the scale.  That's right.  I see the yellow on the underwear.  Wait, you say take off your pants?  Well...  This is the X-inverse.  Oh, my...  Oh, please have, like, shit stayed in the front.  In the front.  If he does, I'm leaving.  I'm...  Oh, good, they're dark.  Smart.  Smart.  Dark.  His legs are fine.  You got good gams, kid.  No disrespect.  He's got dark panties on.  He is good.  He's got good fucking, uh...  All right.  Good, uh, calves. 
[02:43:00]  I don't...  I'll announce the number, like...  You know what?  Are you knock...  If you're knock-kneed, I'm fucking knocking your teeth out.  Can you turn around and let me see?  Are you knock-kneed?  No, he's all right.  Okay.  Oh, from the waist down, he's...  You do all right.  You are.  You got a good cock bulge?  All right.  Ian's, uh, weighing him.  These guys have been weighing him for months now, by the way.  What's he at?  Hold on.  Let me do it.  Let me do this show.  This is Dr. Ian's big moment.  All right. 
[02:43:30]  Add a few pounds.  Your weight tonight is...  214 pounds.  Hey, E-Rock, you got 20 pounds to lose.  Here's the deal, baby.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Before...  What happened to the nine pounds?  The clothes and the wallet and all that stuff.  The fucking wallet was weighing down on.  Are you shitting me?  You lost nine pounds?  Wait, we just weighed you what?  Yesterday.  No, two days ago.  Two days ago, you lost nine pounds? 
[02:44:00]  Well, you took all your clothes off in the huge wallet, but...  That's what Jimmy was telling him, is the clothes and all that stuff.  Giant wallet diet.  Yeah.  But 214, he's still up there.  You still got 20 to lose.  How much does his wallet weigh?  24 pounds.  Half a pound.  Half a pound.  How did that fucking work?  Wait, get back on the scale.  Yeah, I want another reading.  We need another reading.  Shoes.  I love how the listeners outside the studio are just discussing the show. 
[02:44:30]  I know.  The listening bill.  What did he say, 12 pounds?  Three and a half pounds?  What are you, fucking Herman Munster shoes?  Three and a half pounds of shoes, wallet, and Blackberry.  All right.  And that doesn't include...  Okay, we'll take his jeans and shirt.  Okay, fine.  You're 214.  Yeah, but that would be a nice weight, E-Rock.  You'd be what?  The 194.  That would be all right for him, right?  Okay, yeah, sure.  He would still be considered fat, though.  Get this on camera, too.  By accepting the money, you accept the arrangement.  Here's the $500 now.  Oh, look at him, accept that money. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, that's not good.  Oh, boy.  That's lunch.  You've got to lose 20 pounds by Thursday, June 28th.  Okay, here's your copy of Extreme Fat Smash Diet.  Okay, if you don't lose it, I'm telling you, man, seriously.  The doc don't play with his money.  I got a kid to feed now.  Hey, congratulations on the new kid there.  Thanks, man.  I hope he doesn't grow up like this, but anyway.  Wow.  He's the nice guy, too.  E-Rock, it's time. 
[02:45:30]  So, E-Rock, those pits are bizarre-looking.  That's amazing.  You look like you're wearing, like, Shazam's shirt.  E-Rock, E-Rock, I'm giving you my cell number.  Is that the wrong one?  I'm treating you like the celebrities.  You get my cell number, they call me any time they want when they have a question.  You can do the same.  But I'm telling you, June 28th, you're down 20 pounds.  Because this is not acceptable.  Hey, can we...  So now we've got to weigh him every week.  And someone go to Dwayne Reed and get him some fucking t-shirts. 
[02:46:00]  We're paying up, don't we?  Jesus Christ.  What do you use as deodorant?  Asparagus piss?  Rebounds from the Shazam bomb.  Strikeout and a home run.  All in the same inning.  Nice.  Sweet.  All right.  So now we've got to weigh him every week again.  We've got to bet.  And will you appear in your underpants at an ONA travel virus comedy?  They just threw t-shirts at him. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, change your fucking t-shirt.  Perfect.  They don't have armpits.  Oh, good.  They're armpitless.  White beaters.  White beaters.  I don't know if you're allowed to say that on regular radio anymore.  Yeah, yeah.  So.  All right.  Any other...  All right, E-Roc.  Any other...  You want to issue it?  You haven't...  Come on.  Off of the challenge.  Give us something.  No, I'm all for it.  I do really need to lose a lot of this weight.  What's the food you can't help but eat?  What's your guilty pleasure?  Cold cuts.  A lot of it.  Cold cuts are good for you, right? 
[02:47:00]  Cold cuts?  What's wrong with cold cuts?  I mean, first of all, do people even call them cold cuts anymore?  I know.  What the fuck?  Lunch meat.  But...  Lunch meat.  We say lunch meat, deli meat, but cold...  Anyway.  Let's not get into semantics.  A lot of salt in those, though.  They're high in sodium.  A lot of sodium.  You can get low-sodium ones.  You can get low-sodium stuff, you know?  Because his blood pressure is probably through the fucking roof.  He's got high cholesterol.  I'm not going to find out today.  How about sweets?  Cakes and...  Sweets.  A lot of pretzels, usually the sourdough.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I like pretzels, too, though, regular. 
[02:47:30]  Those are really bad, right?  But I get them without the salt.  And I think soda is a big problem, too.  Diet soda or regular soda?  What do you eat?  Drink?  Either Diet Coke with lime or Coke Zero.  Oh, but it's diet, though.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  Do you know this, guys?  If you drank...  Let's say...  This is crazy.  If you drank one can of regular soda a day, switched it to diet soda, do nothing else,  don't change your workout, nothing.  15 pounds in a year. 
[02:48:00]  Is that crazy?  Wow.  Just by switching the...  These are the tips that I talk about in the book.  But anyway, so you don't...  No, diet soda's fine.  I'm good with diet soda.  Well, I'm trying to cut that all out, too.  Just go right to...  All right.  All right.  Think I'd big eat beef if he wasn't drinking diet soda.  Yeah, we got a bit now, man.  We'll check in weekly until we get to the due date.  Watch these guys fucking behind the scenes.  They'll dump his diet Coke out and put Coke in it.  Oh, they're going to be fucking spreading mayonnaise on everyone.  Let me tell you something. 
[02:48:30]  You guys, I'm excited.  Iraq gets a lot of abuse on this show.  This is...  You could show a lot of people something, finally.  You walk in here and you lose all that, what, 30...  Wait, 20 pounds?  20 pounds.  Oh, that finally was hurtful.  You can show people something, finally.  Finally.  I think Iraq's done a few things.  Show people something.  To imply...  No, as far as these guys go, they kill them on a regular basis.  They will never look at him and go,  You've finally shown us something.  You can finally shut him up a little bit.  Show a little self-control. 
[02:49:00]  You can shut him up.  Oh, here comes Stan.  He'll be able to scream,  I'm not obese.  I'm finally just overweight.  Tell me, Iraq.  A little bit of progress is good.  Hey.  All right.  How about this?  A little more incentive.  20 pounds in seven weeks.  What if he does 30?  Is that healthy in seven weeks?  30 pounds in seven weeks?  That's a lot, right?  I'll put another $200 on it. 
[02:49:30]  Whoa.  I'll put $200 on it.  Is that bad, though?  Is that losing too much?  No, no.  I don't think you should worry about losing too much weight there, Iraq.  Yeah.  Slow down.  Focus.  Okay.  Okay.  That's a nice little stretch goal, we like to call them.  Stretch goal.  Focus on the 20.  Because if you don't get it, I'm coming after you.  So you'll add another 200.  I'll add another 200.  I'll add 200 if he loses 25 pounds.  Okay.  25 pounds.  I'll buy a lunch down over at Roo.  Yeah, that's good.  That's good.  You can tell that Anthony's been losing at the tables lately, because he's usually the 
[02:50:00]  one that has no problem throwing the money around.  You know what?  I don't want the 30 pounds.  How's that gambling addiction?  Jesus Christ.  It's killing me.  It's like the third day in a row that money has been offered, and it's like, ah, well,  I, ah.  Why would I give you rock money?  You give everybody money, though.  Come on.  The guy's 29.  He's with his girl.  I don't want you losing 30, because I want you to do something stupid.  I want you to follow the diet.  20.  I was right.  25.  Okay.  25.  We add two.  I'll add two more 100.  He has 200.  You got $900.  And you still only lose 100. 
[02:50:30]  I won't increase that.  Okay.  Okay?  All right.  Oh, that's right.  I do tighten up, and I'm not sure if we're going to have a fucking job.  The next day.  I thought it was because you're gambling.  No.  I'm not gambling any more than I used to.  Hey, Dr. Dean, I can't shit.  What's up?  Ah, good question.  Can I suggest a little constipation?  From what?  It's the hours, though, because on weekends, no problem.  You're doing your thing.  No.  Oh, boy.  Speaking of shitting.  What? 
[02:51:00]  Oh, here's Pete again.  Jesus.  If we move due date up and have him do the...  God, Pete, how many are you going to send me?  Ding dong.  Oh, whatever.  Pete's trying to figure out how to get...  He wants to get him naked on Jones Beach.  He's very excited to get him naked on the stage.  What's the date for Jones Beach?  June 16th.  Tickets available now.  Oh, 12 days?  Yeah.  I mean, it's all day difference.  28 days.  Yeah, yeah.  No, we're going to keep it...  Okay.  Okay.  No, we're going to keep it on schedule.  I don't want to kill the freaking guy. 
[02:51:30]  On schedule.  All right.  You got a mission there, Iraq.  Wow.  So what do I need to add in my diet to shit?  I'm doing...  Fiber.  Metamucil?  No, no, no.  Isn't that crap?  Why?  Natural fiber.  Like what?  Like tons of vegetables.  I eat a lot of vegetables.  Tons of...  Tons of vegetables.  That's what gets people is all the veggies and fruits.  You know what also helps you shit sometimes?  Remove cock.  Fuck. 
[02:52:00]  We're having a decent, intelligent conversation.  We're trying to get something done.  That's why I love Jimmy.  Right back where I belong was a shit and gay joke in the same one.  I want an art form.  Jimmy likes to massage my tummy, though.  Look at what Jimmy's eating over there.  I have to.  That is a cornucopia.  Yeah.  Freaking...  That's nice.  He's got a smoothie.  He's got vegetables.  What's the other thing in the right?  Oatmeal?  No, it's just a little bit of low-fat dressing.  Oh, wow. 
[02:52:30]  Like vinegar or vinegar.  Yep.  That's what I say.  I said...  He's got...  Look, he's got tomatoes, peppers, carrots.  Asparagus.  So your piss is going to smell like Iraq's armpits.  Asparagus is great.  I love asparagus.  Me too.  Oh, Iraq.  Salmon's good for you, right?  It's a bad day to wear that shirt, huh?  Salmon's the best.  Omega 3.  All right, man.  Listen, these guys don't believe in you.  I do this with the meanest, nastiest guys in the business, and they lose the weight.  I know you can lose the weight.  And the pest, man.  You're representing the pest. 
[02:53:00]  I mean, these guys...  And speaking of mean guys and stuff, Celebrity Fit Club, these people that have lost all the  weight on past shows, where are they at now?  Oh, my goodness.  So, good news and bad news.  What do you want first?  Oh, yeah.  See, we didn't need the inside crap.  Well, I'm an XM now.  I could talk.  I couldn't talk.  I mean, VH1, they show the same show 20 times a day.  I need more than that now.  I need some stuff that we're not seeing.  My biggest disappointment is the guy who I loved, Phil Margera. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, he lost how much?  He lost 42 pounds in 100 days.  He had the record or something.  He had the record.  He gained it all back.  Gained it all back.  Gained it all back.  That was obvious, though.  Well, I think the stress with Bam and...  Wow.  I don't know who Phil is.  Viva La Bam.  I know the Margera name.  Is that Don Vito?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  He's his brother.  His brother.  His brother.  So people don't understand you've got to change your whole lifestyle.  They think as soon as you lose the weight by following a diet, then you're done and you  can go back to eating and doing what you were doing. 
[02:54:00]  But you really got...  It's a lot of hard work.  You know who's kept it off?  Who?  Gary Busey.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We've seen...  Unbelievable.  Problem is, he looks like a human skeleton.  You didn't do him a favor because he lost all that weight and now those teeth look massive.  Giant.  Like he should be in a classroom.  I told Busey, he's the only guy ever on the show.  I said, you cannot lose another freaking pound.  I remember you did.  You're going crazy.  I mean, the guy went so intense. 
[02:54:30]  Isaac from The Love Boat?  Yeah.  Perfect.  Hasn't put on another freaking pound.  Even...  Well, why would he?  He's not going to be eating at craft services.  He hasn't worked since 1979.  Oh, God.  And Tiffany on the latest show.  Yuck.  Yuck.  Big, huge boobies.  Yeah, I saw what you did there.  But you don't like the...  Who do you think you're talking to? 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, I'll let that slide.  I'm digging on the Tiffany.  Let everyone know that you just made the international sign for big boobies.  International sign.  Universally accepted.  Right.  Yeah, this is international.  No, she did...  Well, she was in Playboy.  She's in Playboy, though.  Three, four years ago.  And now she wants to get back down to her Playboy weight.  She is...  Really?  She was never hot, by the way.  I'm sorry.  Maybe she had her body in shape, but the face...  Ugh.  Yeah.  Sorry, Dr. Ian, I'm sure you can't talk bad about anybody. 
[02:55:30]  Wasn't that back in, like, fucking 1988 or something?  What, the Playboy?  No, like, when she was popular.  Oh, yeah.  I think we're alone now.  Then she got popular because she went into Playboy.  She was a kid.  A few years back.  And she says on the show, she says she wanted to change her image from being a kid star,  so she did the Playboy thing.  Looked very good on the cover of Playboy.  I didn't see the spread, but looked very good.  And she totally just, you know, married, kid, the whole thing.  Yeah, kind of get out of shit.  But I got to tell you, like, sometimes when you look up, when you're sitting there, these  women, they really go, like, from show one to show eight, they really look totally different. 
[02:56:00]  Like, when you see her in show eight...  It's only eight shows?  Eight shows.  Over a hundred days.  Why does it take fucking six months?  Jesus.  What's VH1 doing?  That's like a marathon.  I could do that on a Sunday.  That's what I said.  You guys got to be on the freaking TV.  What's wrong with you?  Why don't you give us the, you know, the DVD of all the episodes right now?  I'll give it to you.  Just do a marathon.  I don't want to wait around.  Love the marathon.  Any more updates on anybody else from the show? 
[02:56:30]  Jack A.  Jack A, yes.  Jack A.  She's kept it all off.  Takara.  She did...  She was the plus size model.  Yeah, something about her is really hot.  The boobs again, you think?  I gave you the...  This was the international sign.  She's very voluptuous.  She's very curvy.  Well, when it comes to, like, big broads, I mean, she's...  There's something really sexy about her.  I got to tell you something.  She did a spread in King Magazine.  That's a black magazine.  That's the black maxim.  I know.  Brother Wee's turned me on to King Magazine, and I thank him. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Can I tell you something?  There's some stuff in that magazine.  Oh, man.  There's some stuff.  It's like...  I got to be careful here.  It is the black maxim.  It really is.  Yeah?  It's all about booties and...  Can I tell you something?  As a scientist, I look at that and say, there's something anatomically not right with somebody's  body.  Like, you just can't believe...  You know...  You think that people, like...  You know how you Photoshop a picture?  Yeah.  Because they're so, like...  Their waists are this big. 
[02:57:30]  Then all of a sudden...  Oh!  A big booty.  A skinny waist.  They were bred with the big bucks back in the day.  Oh, that's the...  Yeah, right?  So, Takara's doing great, and...  Tell Anthony about King Magazine, though.  It's all, like...  Dude.  You know...  It's like Maxim, so they don't get naked, but they show off...  Yeah.  Show off enough.  I'm going to be honest with you.  The black women.  I'm going to be honest with you.  If you want to find a magazine where you're just, like...  Holy...  Every page, you're like, holy cow, what is that?  And if you don't have an aversion to black women, if you're fine with black women, you 
[02:58:00]  would love this magazine.  Bam!  A lot of that.  Like the...  A lot of the back going in, and then...  Oh, and they go shelf.  Then the shelf.  They do go shelf.  Is it crazy or what?  They go shelf.  I remember when...  You and I were in a strip club in Atlanta when we were thinking about moving down there,  and there was a black stripper there, and I remember she was, like, doing her thing,  and I thought that she had a shelf, and it was like, is that an extra body part that  white women don't have?  You just wanted to rest with the hair right there.  When you see it without pants on, you're like, what? 
[02:58:30]  There's extra, like, meat back there.  We had a waitress last night.  We were down at the Buddha bar, the anniversary, sitting there with my brother and Stray, and  we had this...  And all of a sudden, the lady walked away, and we're like, that's not normal.  Like, that is abnormal.  I'm talking as a doctor.  That is a specimen.  Like, you just can't...  You look...  You almost look...  Sometimes you do look more at an ass like that than you do a hot woman's ass.  Like, if a hot woman's walking down the street, and you'll give the turn of the head, look 
[02:59:00]  at the ass, and go, that's nice.  But these distorted, giant, fucking weird alien asses, I will stop dead in my tracks, turn  around, and stare like, I can't figure it out.  Right.  You're trying to figure the thing out.  You're trying to figure out what that would look like with no clothes on it.  Oh.  Speaking of Tiffany naked, here you go.  You saw this.  Did you see this a few years back?  Yeah.  I mean, she looks great.  She looks unbelievable there, but her face doesn't look like that. 
[02:59:30]  You gotta like that.  They smoothed out everything.  You know what we did?  Man, I gotta be careful giving so much of the show away, but towards the end of the show...  Like, see, this is the lightest cast ever, right?  Yeah.  Because they don't have like 100 pounds to lose.  Like, Bone Crusher was 400...  Whoa.  Never saw that before.  Whoa.  Bone Crusher was like 464 pounds.  But, so, the reason why we did Extreme, so you can lose the weight fast, because these  guys were like having...  You know, she goes on Extreme towards the end of the show.  Oh, Tiffany?  Tiffany. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, yeah?  Hot?  When you...  Like I said, you gotta see her in show one, and see her in show eight.  You gotta see the difference.  Yeah.  I already know who wins.  I found out during the walkover.  I'll tell you guys after the break when Ian leaves.  That's it, I'm fired.  You can't tell.  Why not?  I lost my show.  I lost my show.  All right, we're gonna take a break and continue.  There was something I wanted to...  I have to tinkle.  Why?  Oh.  I don't know.  I've been holding it.  Yeah.  Jimmy tinkles a lot. 
[03:00:30]  Is that a problem?  I don't know if it's a swollen prostate.  I've been tested for diabetes.  I thought it was, but it's not.  It's not diabetes, because that's the first thing in my mind was diabetes.  Yeah, I said, Patrice O'Neill told me that, too.  Get the finger.  I've gotten that already.  Oh, you have?  The doctor?  Yeah, I've had my prostate checked 38.  I look younger, thanks.  And you got your prostate checked already?  I've had my doctor.  Why not?  Yeah, I was there.  By fucking dates.  38?  Yeah.  Sure.  When they put a finger in your ass, that's checking the prostate, right?  Well...  Well, it depends on who they is. 
[03:01:00]  Not when it's tip-optional.  No, no, no.  But I mean, when you adopt him...  After a massage.  It's called a digital rectal exam.  I had that a couple years ago.  Yeah.  I want to...  Okay, can I just say something?  Sure.  I'm not going to try to freak you out.  But first of all, the guidelines are that you start getting your DREs at the age of 40.  I might have asked for it.  I might have said I wanted it.  I don't remember.  No, no, no.  At 10, he asked for it.  It was what he was wearing. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, wait, wait.  You know what it was?  I think it was because I was pissing so much.  That might have been why they checked and he was swollen.  All right, all right.  Okay, all right.  You got to give me all the facts.  Okay, I didn't remember.  Okay, now.  He was wearing assless chaps.  Yeah.  And the doctor, when he's checking, I was like, does it feel normal?  He went, yeah.  So what would make me piss so much?  I do drink a lot of caffeine.  Caffeine will do it.  A lot of liquids will do it.  But I...  Let me ask you a question. 
[03:02:00]  Do you feel like you go to the bathroom a lot more than you used to?  Yeah.  Hard to...  Yeah, I mean, I've been a piss off for 10 years.  Ever since I've known you.  It's been ridiculous.  Yeah, but some people can't even drive from here to Boston without stopping, no joke, six,  seven times.  Yeah, but he probably has a small...  Some people have small bladders, though.  Aw, Jimmy.  Aw, Jimmy.  Your little bladders, like a little kitten.  Let me give your bladder a little tussle.  My bladder's tiny, guys.  It's tiny.  Guys, I have a small bladder.  Adorable.  Hi, I'm Jimmy's bladder. 
[03:02:30]  A little fidget bladder.  My bladder's...  An ozone bladder sighting.  Could that be it?  Because I...  It's embarrassing.  I wasn't sure if it was cystitis or not.  Getting all fancy.  Cystitis.  What is cystitis?  Inflammation of the lining of the bladder.  Look at this guy.  Could it be that or no?  How would I know if it's that?  I know carbonated beverages.  It's very uncommon.  Really?  A young guy like you, unless you had some bad stuff in there.  Yeah. 
[03:03:00]  It's uncommon.  It's uncommon.  But what cures it?  What works with it?  What?  Going to the bathroom frequently?  Like, how do you know you have cystitis?  Even if it's uncommon, you still don't know.  You take antibiotics.  It's a tough diagnosis.  If I've had it, I've had it for 10 years.  No, no, no.  You don't have cystitis.  You probably have a small bladder.  There's absolutely no cure for it.  You just go to the bathroom a lot.  Some guys don't like that.  Some bladder transplants?  But here's the weird part.  Like, I'll piss, right?  And then I'll go back to bed, and a few minutes later, I have to piss...  Not a few minutes later, but a lot of times I'll wake up and have to piss again. 
[03:03:30]  I haven't...  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  That's a whole different thing.  You're saying you go to the bathroom, and then within an hour, you've got to go again?  Well, it may not an hour, but it depends.  A part of it's psychosomatic thing.  Depends might be the solution.  But no, it depends.  Very nice.  Sometimes, uh...  Yeah, sometimes an hour later, sure.  You know what you need?  You need a void...  What's called a void test.  You need to see if you're getting all your stuff out at once.  Okay.  I don't think I am, and I'll tell you why. 
[03:04:00]  Like, a lot of times I'll go piss on a plane, and then I sit down, and a few minutes later...  You know what I feel when you have to piss?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I feel it five minutes later.  It's like, I know that there's something not...  Like, I'm not voiding everything.  There's something...  What's that mean?  I don't know how that...  Retention.  You have...  It's called urinary retention.  Listen to me sound like a freaking...  Oh, no, no.  This is good stuff.  I think I'm on the show to have fun, guys.  Okay, this is fun.  I like...  Yeah, when talking about Jimmy pissing...  You need to have a void test to make sure that you're emptying your bladder completely,  because what happens is if you don't empty it, then very soon afterward, you feel like 
[03:04:30]  the urge to go to the bathroom again, and you go...  And that could be the issue.  It's not an infection.  It's that you're not voiding completely.  But how do I void completely?  Well, hopefully there's no blockage.  But if there's a blockage, what would it be?  Oh, no.  Oh, Jesus.  And I've had this for so many years.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  If it was cancer or something...  Oh, Jesus.  No, you did.  Don't say that.  No, I don't think it is.  No, it's not.  No.  No.  If you had cancer for 10 years, you'd be dead. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah, I would know it.  If you had cancer for 10 years, you'd be dead.  Thank you, doctor.  But I mean, what kind of blockage could it be?  Anatomical.  Sometimes the neck of the bladder, it's a...  Okay, because I've had invasive surgery once.  It's funny.  It's right around where my appendix scar is.  My appendix burst when I was 7.  Whoa.  See?  Oh, look at more info now.  See, what I told you about all this stuff.  You had surgery, invasive surgery near the...  I don't know where the bladder is compared to the appendix,  but I mean, they had to go in and fish through my back. 
[03:05:30]  Your appendix is lower, right?  They had to fish through your back.  I mean, like, you know, my appendix scar is right there.  Yeah.  Right.  And they burst.  No, I don't lift my stomach.  It's fucking annoying.  It's like, that's my appendix scar there.  Yeah, I had to show the doctor my fat stomach.  This is a sign of your not fat, too.  I'm still a mushy disaster.  Get the poison out and shit?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They burst.  Wow.  Oh, you had a burst appendix?  Burst appendix.  At a very young age.  Very rare.  7.  7.  At 7?  Yeah, they fucking...  I'll never forget.  Dr. Halopoulos in Edison saved my life.  They could have died from that, man.  They blasted. 
[03:06:00]  So I'm wondering, could something have happened during that surgery, or could he have sewn  something?  Sometimes when you have surgery like that, you could have scar tissue form, and the scar tissue,  believe it or not, could grow.  Sounds crazy, but the scar tissue can grow, and it can become a physical impediment.  I don't know what happened.  You know, this is how many years later.  What I would do if I were in your situation, I'd go to my urologist, I'd say exactly what  you're saying.  I'd keep going to the bathroom, you're a young guy.  Old guys is different, by the way. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Young guy, no diabetes, and I'd look to make sure that there was no kind of obstruction.  They'd do a quick little urine flow thing, they'd put it on the screen and see if you're  emptying your bladder.  Boom.  You're done.  And maybe, I think that you just have a small bladder.  That's my guess.  Well, why would I have to go, this is, when I sit down on the plane again, why would it  feel like something hit, like I don't feel something shift, but all of a sudden  I feel like there's more liquid in there and I haven't drank any more liquid.  It's like, that to me is like, I have to piss again.  That's the weird part.  That's the retention part.  Jimmy's pouring his heart out about his bladder. 
[03:07:00]  And we're looking at ghetto booty.  Ghetto booty ass.  Oh, I don't blame you.  This is what you're shifting back and forth.  Thank you to whoever sent this in on.  It's a feedback.  God damn.  A YouTube video called Ghetto Booty.  See, that's a shelf.  That's like an extra part that white women just don't have.  No.  No.  Oh my goodness.  And that is why the NBA is filled with black basketball players.  It's moving with a mind of its own. 
[03:07:30]  Wow.  That ass is moving completely independent of her upper section.  She looks like an ant with a separate thorax and abdomen.  You know when someone liked that, by the way?  Lawrence Taylor.  We're at the Pro Bowl.  And everyone's like, there's Lawrence Taylor.  There's Lawrence Taylor.  So we get up to say, what's up to him?  And the lady he's with, you're seeing her straight on.  All of a sudden, they start walking towards the beach.  I swear, I absolutely swear.  And I see, I'm a brother, so I see booties all my life, right? 
[03:08:00]  It looked like someone had taken two basketballs, squeezed them together, and jammed it into her dress.  It was, everyone on the beach.  We're in Hawaii.  We're on the beach.  Everyone is stopping old white dudes, old ladies on canes.  They're like, did it look good?  It was interesting.  In a weird way.  Cartoonish.  Yeah.  I got an observation that has to be said.  You know, you got Dr. Ian Smith, very respectable. 
[03:08:30]  He's got these diet books, New York Times bestseller, celebrity fit club, germaphobe, right?  A little bit.  A little bit.  He's a dirty boy, though.  I think so.  Yeah, Jimmy knows.  Jimmy knows.  No.  It's got to be said.  No.  You're a dirty boy.  He's very well-kemped.  You see his nails?  You got something.  You got a manicure.  Look at those nails, man.  He's a neat freak and a responsible gentleman.  They are manicured.  Shiny, nice.  A neat freak and a responsible...  Here's what he likes.  He's a responsible gentleman. 
[03:09:00]  All right.  Gentlemanly.  It's time to turn the mirror on you, mister.  Yeah, okay.  Come on.  Come on.  His nickname is the German shit-filled kid.  Oh, God.  He has caviar party one through 40.  This is caviar party.  I'm not saying...  Because I know you get a little paranoid.  I'm not saying you act on anything, but...  No, no, movies.  Listen, I think a healthy imagination is good.  There you go.  See?  Absolutely.  There you go.  All right.  We should take a break. 
[03:09:30]  All right.  So we're done with D-Rock.  You feel less than...  You all right with what he told you?  Yeah.  Small bladder for you.  I'm going to take my child bladder and go.  Little kid's bladder.  My bladder refuses to grow up.  Oh, by the way...  I'm going to have a pan bladder.  When are you going to be back in New York?  Because we're doing one of our favorite bits.  We're bringing back What the Hell is That?  Are you knowledgeable enough to, like, kind of diagnose people?  Not officially.  Yeah, of course.  You mean, like, you give me some symptoms or whatever, and I say...  Yeah, we did this bit a few years back. 
[03:10:00]  It was hilarious.  What are you doing?  What the hell is that?  What the hell is that?  They come in with some weird things.  One guy came in, and only half the side of his face would sweat profusely when he ate spicy food.  Oh, that's awesome.  And then the doctors...  Yeah.  No, no, I mean, because it's like a medical anomaly.  Yeah.  And then we get the group of doctors together.  His nerves.  And you can be one of them.  And then you guys kind of, like, decide what it is.  And it's not official.  We tell these people they got to really get it checked out by their regular doctor.  But someone's got, like, something, you know...  I got this bump on my leg, and they show you. 
[03:10:30]  We would love to have a celebrity doctor.  We had a celebrity doctor last time from Temptation Island when that show was hot.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So we'd love to have you do that.  That'd be great.  I think we're going to do it in a couple weeks, so we got to see when you're free.  Okay.  Roll and let me know.  All right.  Very good.  And then we got to talk about fingers up the ass when we get to back.  I have to tinkle.  That's fine.  I went in for strep throat, and doctors, you know, doing that.  And I think...  I don't think I should have found out on that.  Huh?  Sue?  Sue him, absolutely.  Maybe the doctor was blind, and Ope was facing the wrong way. 
[03:11:00]  He said, wow, you have bad breath.  That old gag.  Oh, hey.  Oh, hey.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  What the hell's going on here? 
[03:11:30]  Awful.  Awful.  Awful.  They're just awful.  Awful people.  All right, we're hanging with Dr. Ian Smith today from Celebrity Fit Club, and his new  book is called Extreme Fat Smash Diet. 
[03:12:00]  And it's already number one, I think, on the bestsellers list.  I have another question for Dr. Smith, too, because I remembered.  Real fast, Jimmy, because I don't want people to get confused.  Because this is a completely different book than the other one.  Oh, yeah.  This is...  It's not like a paperback version.  You just threw a couple different pages in.  This is a whole different book than the last one.  Let me tell you why I wrote this book.  Sorry, Jimmy.  Why not?  We'll get back to Jimmy.  A lot of your pests made me write this book, because they would keep emailing me and say,  how do I lose weight quickly?  How do I lose weight quickly?  The right way.  So I said, you know what?  Let me figure out.  Can you do it in a healthy way? 
[03:12:30]  Because I obviously can't tell them to do something crazy.  You got to go to the lab and do some equations and stuff, right?  And so this is the way to lose weight fast, 12 pounds in three weeks at least, or more.  But you do it healthy and you keep it off.  We have a maintenance phase on here.  But it's regular food.  I mean, look at the recipes.  It's glazed honey, salmon.  It's all kinds of stuff.  It's chicken casserole.  I love the chicken.  Anyway, so we developed a book.  This is about losing weight fast, but losing it in a healthy way.  I got sick of telling people, don't lose it fast, lose it in a healthy way. 
[03:13:00]  So this is the healthy fast.  So you know what?  And we live in this day and age where people want everything done immediately.  So it's perfect.  Going on vacation, getting married.  It's perfect.  Because no one wants to invest all that time when you can do it.  But you know what?  It's extreme.  And so you know what?  Are you going to suffer?  Well, no.  But I'm telling people, listen.  Suffer.  I'm telling people, listen.  Don't ask me to perform a miracle and you're not willing to do what you got to do.  You know what I mean?  Like, here's the deal.  I'll give you the plan.  But you got to commit to it.  Don't sit there and say, oh, but I don't want to exercise.  What do you want to do? 
[03:13:30]  You know, watch porno?  I mean, like.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's exercise on one arm.  That's mental exercise.  Well, that's.  Look at Jimmy's forearm, man.  It's massive.  My right arm and my left arm.  It's Popeye meets Stephen Hawking.  So anyway.  So extreme fat smash diet is the new fat smash.  All right.  Which gives you a detailed plan and you just go at it.  There you go.  Well, Steve, she wants to know if a certain thing is allowed on the extreme fat smash. 
[03:14:00]  Steve.  Cockmeat.  Nothing but cockmeat.  Ah, cockmeat.  Yeah.  I can't hear it.  You didn't hear that?  Oh, do you have headphones on?  How could you not hear Steve?  Oh, there we go.  Sorry.  Cockmeat.  Wait.  Nothing but cockmeat.  Wait.  You've had the headphones on the whole time and you can't hear it through them?  No.  I've been hearing you guys regularly.  Why not?  I've been hearing you regularly.  It's like, wow, you guys are a little muffled.  No, I could hear you, but I guess I was hearing you in the regular.  Just muffled through the headphones wearing earmuffs. 
[03:14:30]  Boy, he's not the sharpest, Doc.  That's like the stupidest thing I've ever done before.  I got some advice for you.  I think you might need to get your ears checked.  I'd hate to go to his office.  I can't see you.  Doc, turn around.  Oh, there you are.  I hope people realize how funny that is.  He's been sitting with us over an hour with headphones on.  He hasn't heard a thing through the headphones.  Electric earmuffs.  That's pretty much it.  Anyway, Jimmy's got another question about his...  Yes, Jimmy, you're a flatter.  It helps me pee.  This is bizarre.  I forgot this.  When I'm peeing, and this is the truth, I feel like I tense up, and if I take my hand, 
[03:15:00]  I swear to you, and I rub my left nipple, it relaxes me.  It gives me the weird thing, and I relax, and it makes me pee easier at times.  Holy shit.  That is...  If you fucking were ever next to me at a bathroom in a urinal and started rubbing your nipples.  It's not homoerotic or sexual at all.  It's like a weird...  Rub your nipples, it never gets hard.  It's like a weird sensation.  I'll rub my nipple, like...  It's just like...  That weird chill is like relaxing. 
[03:15:30]  I don't know if it's doing something.  What is that?  I got to tell you.  I don't know.  Okay.  I'm an honest guy.  I don't know the answer to that.  It's possible it could be a reflex.  I will check into that, but next time I come on, I will explain to you whether or not nipple stimulation...  Or the chills.  It sounds like a chill.  You know when you're taking a leak sometimes, and you're a little pee shy at a public restroom,  and you've got to kind of concentrate sometimes on a spot on the wall, just so you can fucking  get anything else out of your mind. 
[03:16:00]  And then you feel this relaxation, and then you're going.  Maybe that's what that is.  That sounds like what you're doing through that.  Some kind of distraction, maybe.  But as a doctor, I want to be 100% sure, so I will investigate and get back to you.  Where are you at on nipple play?  Do you like it?  Yeah, a lot of...  Very erogenous, man.  Yeah, see?  Really?  I don't get it.  Absolutely.  I don't get the nipple play.  A lot of guys don't.  I go, tee hee hee!  I start laughing.  On my self.  It's a moment, because I'm ticklish.  I'm very ticklish, Jimmy.  When I fuck my girlfriend, I like her to do this with her hands, and just gently... 
[03:16:30]  I don't like her to be even licked anymore, needlessly.  Just the palm of the hand, just a little like, shuka, shuka, shuka.  Very erogenous.  I'm serious.  You want her to shuka, shuka, shuka?  Yeah.  With her open palms?  Sometimes.  No, she doesn't mind.  Like an Indian used to brand a horse with a painted palm, and just smack your nipple,  and rub in a circular mouth.  Just gentle.  Like Mr. Miyagi.  Yes.  Like wax on, wax off on your nipples.  Paint that fence, whore, if you want to get fucked.  I miss how the show... 
[03:17:00]  This show's great.  It starts here.  Way over here.  Oh, yeah.  Then all of a sudden, in seconds, you're like, way out of the ballpark.  Where the hell did we go?  Where did we go?  I mean, that was great.  You gotta talk about Miyagi and...  How's Strahan, by the way?  How's Michael Strahan?  He's awesome.  Okay, cool.  Man, does he...  Bring him back.  We love him.  He has some pretty girls.  Really?  Divorce is a great thing for him.  Oh, my God.  We read all the articles, but sorry.  It was tough to feel sorry for the guy.  We saw him when he was walking around with us.  Yeah, we saw...  We hate his ex-wife.  Oh, you kidding?  After reading all that stuff?  And, you know, I have an ex... 
[03:17:30]  I gotta deal with myself.  And it's no treat.  Believe me.  And to have to go into court and what she was claiming, Strahan's wife was claiming, it  made me sick.  You know what?  She wasn't out there taking the hits.  How can I be diplomatic here?  Don't be.  No, it's great as how you were dragged into the whole thing as possibly being his gay  lover.  And then they got...  Oh, when that was in the paper?  And then they got a picture of Michael Strahan jogging, not with Dr. Ian Smith, but Dr. 
[03:18:00]  Ian Smith's twin brother.  Yeah, it's like what?  We're doing like a double team on him?  Like, what the freak?  Double team?  Well, it's like...  But that's what she claimed, which is...  But you could claim anything if you're...  That's the point.  The point is because I'm a...  The ex-wife in distress.  The point is because I'm a public personality.  She could make these wild claims, and we were going to take care of it, but believe  it or not, our lawyer died.  Oof.  Your lawyer or hers?  Ours that we were going to use.  Mel Sachs.  Remember that guy?  I've heard of that name. 
[03:18:30]  Everybody, Mel Sachs.  He died like two weeks after we had paperwork together of pancreatic cancer, like that.  I was like, you know what?  Maybe this is a sign.  Let it go.  You know?  Because here...  Think about it.  She's not famous.  Because you're more well-known than she is.  How does she keep stuff going?  She just...  If you keep engaging her, then she keeps her name in the paper.  Right, right.  She likes being in the spotlight.  Of course.  Yeah.  Come on.  Who would have their...  Who would let photographers, paparazzi, take pictures of their daughter with all these 
[03:19:00]  cycles out here?  You invite them into your house to take pictures of your daughters and put them on the front  page of a paper.  That's responsible parenting.  Yet, they yell and scream at Alec Baldwin because Alec Baldwin does what probably 90%  of parents do.  They just have like a meltdown.  You know what I mean?  They're like their kids.  Come on.  I mean, my parents have yelled at me before.  Oh, my God.  You know?  When I heard the Alec Baldwin tapes, I'm like, what's the big deal?  Because I had a pretty interesting upbringing as far as...  Listen, the guy is being told... 
[03:19:30]  Like, the wife is very...  It's so straightforward.  The wife has been playing games with him.  She has primary custody.  He's got to follow the court order.  People don't realize this.  These court orders are going to be very meticulous about it.  He's got to call at a certain time and blah, blah, blah.  The girl's not answering it.  The mother's turning against the father.  He's got to fly to LA to see her.  I just think that...  I don't know all the details, but I'm sitting here.  The first thing I heard about it was...  When I heard it, I was like, something drove this guy to do this, obviously.  Yeah, this wasn't the first phone call.  No, it wasn't the... 
[03:20:00]  And then, who releases that?  Why do you release that?  You release that because you're going after this guy.  You know?  Here's a guy hurting, obviously, because he wants to have a relationship with his freaking daughter.  At least he's not a deadbeat dad saying...  Not calling her, right?  He's upset because he wants to bond with his daughter.  And then, I just think that the guy gets a bad rap.  And then the ex definitely leaked that.  I mean, come on.  Get out of here.  Who else leaked it?  Well, good parenting.  I mean, like, I had cousins, Andrea and Rusty, in Houston. 
[03:20:30]  And they were nice people.  Andrea and Rusty.  I like Rusty.  Rusty.  Where were we?  Nipple play.  I don't know.  What was Rusty?  Let's talk about Rusty.  What was that?  What's up with Rusty?  I don't know how he's doing.  They had problems in the marriage.  Uh-huh.  You know.  Why are you calling for this, Dr. James Smith?  It's true.  They're a doctor.  They went away. 
[03:21:00]  You're a doctor.  Yeah.  What's wrong with you?  Problem solved.  Yeah.  She's a problem solver.  She certainly is.  All right.  Hey, we got a rotting cornea guy from the last time we played.  Five rooms need a repainting.  By the way, we've learned a lot on this show today.  We got Larry the Cable guy is going to do a surprise set at one of our five or three.  Or three.  Or three.  Anyway, and we learned that Dr. Ian Smith's going to be one of the doctors when we play  What the Hell is That?  Yeah.  Anthony, what's up? 
[03:21:30]  Yo, what's up, bro?  Nothing.  I was the guy with the cornea problem.  Yeah, he came in for What the Hell is That?  Let me tell Dr. Ian Smith.  And he had kind of a cornea that was kind of disappearing on him.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Terian's corneal.  You ever hear of it?  Say it again?  Terian's corneal disease.  Never heard of it, but it sounds sickening.  Yeah, it sounds pretty bad.  That's I8.  Like Opie said, though, I am not blind, like you said, actually, the other day, Opie.  Oh, would you get a cornea transplant? 
[03:22:00]  No, I never got the transplant.  No such thing, really.  No?  Just kind of living with it, I guess.  There is cornea transplant.  No such thing as a cornea transplant?  I think I've heard about those.  Of course there is.  That's just creepy, though.  There's got to be.  There is.  Yeah, there is.  Why don't you look into it?  Sorry.  Sorry for the joke.  I'm having a job.  That was cornea.  You know?  Lots of money.  I like you and I'm not very a joke.  Oh, I see.  You're right.  I should have said it.  Get the right one.  I shouldn't have been cornea.  Get the right one.  If you're going to go after one of the hosts, get the right one.  How much?  What are you going to do, lash me? 
[03:22:30]  How much sight do you got?  Well, that eye is pretty blind still.  I mean, it hasn't really gotten worse.  It hasn't gotten better, but...  Well, if you're not going to do anything for it, it's not going to get better.  Of course not, sir.  You're being very low, bro.  Well, it's not doing anything.  I've had it examined numerous times, and they just said, you know, it's still there.  Educate yourself on this subject.  Be an apt pupil.  By the way, well, what do you got, Anthony? 
[03:23:00]  This really isn't going anywhere except for that.  No, he's dilating.  All right, bye.  Sorry, you're just a spectacle.  Spectacles.  I've got a question for Dr. Ian Smith from some guy named Pat from Munaki.  Pat from Munaki.  Dr. Ian Smith, he asks, is it bad to eat 25 hot dogs in 12 minutes?  Oh, no.  Or a diabetic.  No, that's the perfect thing to eat.  Are you kidding?  Yeah.  That's awesome. 
[03:23:30]  Try 30.  Try 30.  He would love 30.  Oh, he would love 30.  Come on.  That's not a real question.  Did Dr. Ian Smith ever see Baby Bird?  Oh, you want to see...  This is great.  I think you should choose...  It's an eggnog drinking contest.  Let me see it.  It was the winner.  How many did he drink?  72-ish, 3-ish.  72 or 73 double shots of eggnog.  One a minute.  He has nine toes.  He has nine toes because he had one...  Yeah, it had to be amputated because of his diabetes.  It wasn't even amputated.  It just ran.  It left a note. 
[03:24:00]  He's obese.  He would be considered obese.  Yes, in any culture, even on Jupiter.  And you got this on video?  Oh, wow.  Yeah, yeah.  It happens to be one of the most popular videos on the internet.  And there is an extra added feature to him just drinking so much of this and having to vomit.  Here's one of my most favorite scientific experiments.  They took a Drosophila fly. 
[03:24:30]  A what?  A Drosophila fly, like a special type of fly that they use in the experiment.  What is that?  It's like a brundle fly.  Yeah, brundle.  Yeah.  They chop off the nerve that tells the Drosophila fly to stop eating.  Oh, wow.  And they just keep feeding it and the thing just eats until it burns.  Really?  I was just...  All the wacky scientists.  And that was just for fun.  Yeah.  That has no value whatsoever.  But it was just...  I just love that experiment.  They just keep...  They can't stop eating. 
[03:25:00]  Oh, when you said it cuts off the nerve that tells it when to stop eating, I was...  I thought then it went and legally had its name changed to Eric.  I'm ready to go for a fat joke.  Sorry, Hawk.  No, that's very good.  It's been a while.  Why don't we bring in E-Rock?  See how the...  Are we going to weigh him?  Yeah, yeah.  Where's Baby Bird?  See if he's lost any weight.  I want to show Dr. Smith Baby Bird.  Ready to go.  Okay.  All right.  This is the result of 75 double shots of eggnog.  This is real footage.  Yeah.  This is Pat and our intern.  Yeah.  Pat, who's out there, actually.  Yeah.  With his head back.  Watch.  Here's Pat from Monaki. 
[03:25:30]  That's the guy that...  Yeah.  He's a competitive eater.  Yeah.  He is a competitive eater.  He's done the hot dog eating contest at Coney Island.  This is like his last shot.  And then he does...  This will be shown all over...  Competitive eating.  ...America this summer when we do the comedy tour.  And this was the eggnog drinking.  That's one of the interns.  He wasn't an intern at the time, but he was willing to do something to become an intern.  He's in the dump egg.  He just throws the eggnog on him.  It's really weird.  Oh, it's hysterical.  Yeah.  Just...  Look at how many shots he...  All right.  So this is... 
[03:26:00]  This is about his last shot coming up here.  He's probably not feeling too good at this point because...  This computer sucks.  ...because the video's buffering.  And you know why?  Because our stupid listeners have to also all jump on and watch along.  And they've seen the video a hundred times.  And they weren't going to do it until we mentioned it.  But now they have to see it today.  And now they all got to jump in.  And then...  All right.  Here's one of his last shots of eggnog.  Yeah.  He's got to be feeling it.  Look at his belly.  See?  That's not healthy, right?  No big deal. 
[03:26:30]  A lot of eggnog.  Diabetes.  Nine toes.  It's a shot.  It's like...  It's a double shot.  It's a double shot.  He doesn't look like he's feeling very good.  Yeah.  Oh.  Now he loses it.  Oh, no.  What's that right there?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That seems to be a human...  Oh, no.  Oh, wait.  It's not even close.  Oh, no.  No.  See?  Oh, no.  No, no, no.  No.  It's a little fire hose segment.  Oh, my goodness.  No.  You haven't seen anything yet.  Look how much comes out of him.  This is hysterical. 
[03:27:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  It won't stop.  No.  It won't end.  No, really.  Yeah, that's got to be over by now, right?  You couldn't possibly have that much eggnog.  You can't have more of you.  It's like a superhero.  This is not real.  Oh, it's 100% real.  It's 100% real.  There's been arguments over this video on the internet.  A lot of people think it's not real, but...  I've watched it happen live.  Oh, come on.  Superhero.  Come on, you guys.  The way he kind of leans back and then goes forward. 
[03:27:30]  He's got to be done now, though, right?  He's a vomit man.  Yeah, he's done.  See?  Yeah, he's done.  I had some of this on my camera, actually.  I videoed some of this.  There you go.  He spits on his face.  And then he spits on him, so...  Who was...  That was him right there, yeah.  Oh, dude.  Oh.  He was willing to do...  Oh, it was his face.  I thought it was his head.  It was his face.  Yes, right on his face.  His mouth was open.  He puked into his mouth.  It's called Baby Bird, the video.  I never want to see that video again.  Oh, look at the terrific beard he's got.  It was nice. 
[03:28:00]  It was like fertilizer.  Fertilizer for that beard.  This is a month and a half without trimming at all.  Really?  I started a one-man beard drawing contest.  Wow.  One contestant.  Only one winner.  Now, he said...  He goes, if I do that, can I be an intern?  And we had to say yes.  And it's Pat Duffy.  And he's got problems.  Pat's a psychopath.  Just about every person you're looking at has problems around here.  He's still pining over his ex.  Dr. Ian Smith, maybe some advice?  Yeah.  What was briefly...  What was the situation with your ex again?  I went out with this girl. 
[03:28:30]  She went to college.  And she sucked a bunch of cocks.  Dan, you can sum shit up so well.  Here's some advice.  Don't kiss her.  You'll want to look like that video again.  But Dr. Ian, some advice for a young guy.  He's only, what, 22, 23?  I'll be 22 on Sunday.  22 on Sunday.  Happy birthday.  Wow, you're just a kid.  22 on Sunday.  May what, 13?  May 15, yes.  You're depressed over this loose woman?  Yes. 
[03:29:00]  Still angry.  Angry.  Yeah, a lot of anger.  How long ago has it been?  Well, end of February is really when it culminated.  End of February.  Yeah, the end of February.  Do you know how much stuff is out there?  Are you out of your mind?  See?  This is freedom, dude.  Dan, have a comment?  Dan, please.  End of February.  So you cut her out of your life completely, right?  No.  Oh, okay.  What's the update?  I actually hung out with her yesterday.  Oh.  No, no, no, no, no.  Sick.  Don't give me the ambiguous words like hung out. 
[03:29:30]  What happened?  I hate fucked her, to be honest with you.  Holy shit.  Yes, she's saying.  No, she's not saying.  Listen to this.  She literally left me for a fighter jet pilot.  I can't compete with that.  No way.  That's called an upgrade, my friend.  That's an upgrade.  We all, all of us are.  I've all been upgraded.  Yeah, we're all upgraded.  Now, here's the question.  Hopefully, it'll be goose.  You really?  It's nice. 
[03:30:00]  Did you really do that to her yesterday?  Yes, absolutely.  What positions?  Awesome.  Well, just a couple.  No, no, no, no.  Hold on.  Hold on.  If it really was a hate thing, one position has to be involved.  So what are the positions?  Why are you twitching?  Because I'm on the radio a little nervous.  Oh, okay.  That's all.  Well, I thought you might need to be diagnosed.  We had a doctor in here.  Answer the question.  What positions?  There he is.  There's my cue for my dad.  God damn it.  I'm sorry.  Why did he call? 
[03:30:30]  Because he's an idiot.  He's a fucking idiot.  Well, his dad calls because, you know, he just wants his kid to shut the fuck up.  But my dad, for some reason, calls my cell phone when I'm right here.  He thinks there's an hour delay or something.  I don't know.  You're on the air.  What positions?  Well, I like missionary position, but I held her so she couldn't do anything.  No, no, no.  That's not hate.  Get out of here.  That's rape.  That's not even.  Well, I don't know.  That's just a good idea.  Did you pull her hair at all?  Yeah.  There was some hair pulling.  Yeah, I was really pissed like the whole time.  But she enjoyed it, right? 
[03:31:00]  Yeah.  You better say that.  Now, why is she having sex with you if she's got fighter pilot guy?  Because he's on a five-day mission.  Five-day mission?  So I have five days, I guess.  This guy's defending the country and she's banging you.  No disrespect.  That's fucking despicable.  I figured I should be nice to her until at least Sunday so I can get late on my birthday.  What is he flying?  F-16.  F-16.  Have you met this guy?  No.  Well, I know.  I went to the same high school.  So he's Air National Guard?  He's Army.  Or Air Force.  I'll take that back.  I'm sorry.  Air Force National.  Oh, he's F-16. 
[03:31:30]  How's he flying him at your age?  You're only 21.  What?  He's younger than I am.  He's younger than you are?  He's 21, yeah.  He's 21.  I'm sorry.  I'll tell you back, he's 20.  He's 20.  He's not flying them yet.  He's not flying them yet.  He's on a fighter jet wheel yet.  Hold the fuck.  There's something going on here.  Something going on here.  The guy's only 20.  He ain't a fucking fighter pilot.  Well, that's what she told me.  She told me that he's in F-16s.  He's in a fighter pilot.  Maybe that's what he's telling her to fuck her.  Maybe.  Because, first of all, I don't think... 
[03:32:00]  I'm not sure on this, but I don't think any of like...  Unless it's in the reserves, they're flying F-16s anymore.  I think the reserves do.  But I don't think any like, you know, the actual Air Force and stuff.  Maybe a few, but...  Well, I have no doubt that you're probably right.  20 years old?  I'm just going by what she told me.  Maybe she's lying to make you jealous.  Maybe.  I look at this MySpace. 
[03:32:30]  He's on a plane.  He's got pictures of himself.  He's on a plane?  He's got pictures of himself.  I'm on a plane every week, too.  He could be a fucking mechanic.  And, you know...  Or a passenger.  An ROTC program and take a picture next to a plane.  Punch that up.  Yeah, I can find it.  Yeah, you find that fucker's sight.  I think Anthony's right.  The idea, why is she fooling around with you now?  There's something going...  There's something fishy about all of this.  She still likes them.  Yeah, there is something fishy.  Go ahead, Pat.  It was sweaty.  I got a...  There's so much to love me yesterday. 
[03:33:00]  What's that, G-1?  You are fucking getting strung along.  What's wrong with you?  You're screwed.  Will you stop with this chick?  You look like Hetfield.  Just headbuttering.  Bootering a cunt and fucking move on.  Send a text message after he went to bed.  After he went to bed, it was like...  He was like, goodnight.  I love you so much.  Have fun tomorrow.  Blah, blah, blah.  You should have sent one back.  So when is she going to break up with the other guy?  Send that...  Send it to the guy.  Send all her messages to that guy.  How about that?  Yeah.  I love how people jump on me, too.  Like, this guy's saying, Ant has F-16s all wrong. 
[03:33:30]  Like I said, I'm not sure about that.  Hit the punch down line six real quick.  Let me talk to Josh.  Maybe we'll get some info.  Josh, what's up, man?  Hey.  Just so you know, Anthony, they do have F-16s in the Air National Guard.  I'm a member of the unit.  I put bombs on them.  Dude, that's what I was saying, though.  I said the National Guard and the Reserves, I believe, still fly F-16s.  But I don't think...  And the active duty.  Right.  Active duty.  Active duty Air Force.  Yep.  Still flies F-16s.  Active duty, reserve, and guards. 
[03:34:00]  They all have F-16s.  Reserve and guard.  That's what I'm saying.  How old are they, dude, the pilots?  Look at that picture.  Oh, shit.  They might be at least 24, 25 before they can even get in the cockpit.  I mean, F-16.  I don't know.  He's in the engine of a fucking, like, a goddamn 767.  You know a baggage guy, and you could get that picture.  Your girlfriend is a dope.  Holy shit.  Well, I've seen...  This is set to private.  I've seen it without...  Yeah, they've got to go through solids, and then they've got to go through, like, a year 
[03:34:30]  and a half of your training.  In the cockpit of what?  A jet.  I got a picture of myself in King Kong's hand when I went to Universal.  All right, thanks, Josh.  Yep.  All right.  So this is...  Damn.  Very interesting update here.  Oh, that's funny.  So she's not going to leave this guy, but she's saying that she loves you.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's really confusing.  Yeah, it certainly is.  There's a lot of deceit going on here.  Do you have other girls?  Yeah.  I hope at least you're...  Are you at least doing your thing? 
[03:35:00]  I have literally zero game whatsoever.  I figure once I hook somebody, I've got to do whatever I can to hold on.  So that's really my plan with this one.  Yeah.  Why did I just say that to two countries?  I'm retarded.  In honor of her Top Gun thing, you ought to play Take My Breath Away and fuck her in  the mouth.  I was thinking it's a good thing Olivia Newton-John didn't sing that song.  Why is Dr. Newton taking his books and going home?  Ripe for parody.  All right. 
[03:35:30]  Well, we should get him a date or something.  I know it's hack radio, but...  It's not even for a radio bit.  It's a fucking public service.  First of all, I got to tell you something.  Yeah.  Not a bad looking guy.  Okay.  Seriously.  I mean, I might lose the beard.  The puke in the face thing, you can put that behind you.  Yeah, put that behind you.  Don't bring that out on the first date.  I think you can shave, get a little clean cut.  I think that all the listeners we got...  That should be the next thing, actually.  Hook him up with a date.  I think that would be awesome.  That would be very cool.  That would absolutely be a chick that would go out with you. 
[03:36:00]  If there are any ladies out there that want to be hate-fucked, give the show a call.  Yeah.

[03:43:30]  That was a marathon.  That was fun.  That went on forever.  Jesus Christ.  What's wrong?  I just got a message that I'm late for my editor.  Oh, no.  I totally...  All right, get out of here.  Get out of here.  Oh, no.  Extreme Fat Smash Diet.  Yes.  Dr. Ian Smith.  It's a brand new book.  It's brand new.  You'll lose the weight faster.  You know, I got to shoot something for HBO in like less than four weeks, 
[03:44:00]  and I'm actually going to want to use this and lose like 10 or 12 pounds.  That would be a huge endorsement for Mr. Dr.  No, but I really want to.  I really want to use it.  It will happen.  You know, you get a lot of questions of the truckers.  This is my decision, by the way, because all you truckers,  every time I come on your show, how can truckers lose weight?  Here's my deal with the truckers on your show.  This is the last thing I'm going to say.  Extreme Fat Smash Diet will work for them,  but if they get the book and email me, I will modify it for truckers.  How about that?  What, do you have a murdered hitchhiker on the front of them? 
[03:44:30]  All right, very good.  Fatsmashdiet at AOL.com.  That's Fatsmashdiet at AOL.com.  If you're a trucker, pick up a copy of the book.  I'll modify it for you because I'm tired of your emails.  That's like yesterday's news at this point.  You've got to update your email address.  Exactly.  I'm probably dumping him all kinds of money to stay on it.  Oh, yeah.  Good point.  I think he's paying for us.  Yeah, good point.  All right, guys.  It's going to be Dr. Ian at DiveFatPig.com.  Guys, it's good coming back.  Pat, you good?

We'll do the June 28th.  We'll do the doctor.  We're going to break his legs.  Yeah, what the hell is that with Dr. Ian Smith?  We'll set that up with Roland.  I need help from the doctor.  Oh, Pat from Menonke.  Oh, Pat.  That's right.  You got to sit through that whole thing.  I was starting to think you were forgetting about me.  Go ahead, Pat.  He's got no confidence.  Hey, Doc.  How you doing, man?  I'm in the middle of training for Nathan's. 
[03:45:30]  Holy shit.  I need to lose some weight.  How much are you trying to lose?  I want to get under 300.  How much do you weigh right now?  I just got on the scale, 340.  340.  Are you serious or is this a joke?  Are you serious?  Wait, dude, you were losing weight there for a while, weren't you?  Yeah, I know.  I got a little depressed there for a while.  What did you get down to, Pat?  Because you were starting to lose weight.  No, I was just, I wasn't under 3.  I was like 305.  And now you're back up to 340? 
[03:46:00]  Yeah, from like Christmas.  Oh, my goodness.  Are you all right?  Since Christmas.  You all right now?  Oh, yeah, I'm fine.  Yeah.  No, seriously.  Oh, is he serious?  Yeah.  I think he was in love.  All right.  Pat, here's the deal.  You ready?  Yes.  Get the book.  Okay.  Because I can't say the whole diet on air, obviously, as a book, but it's an easy-to-read  book.  It's Extreme Fat Smash Diet.  Get it on Amazon.  Save yourself a dollar.  Get it on Amazon for $8.37.  I don't care how you get it. 
[03:46:30]  But here's the deal.  Email me after you get the book.  All right.  All right?  You got my email address, right?  Yes, I do.  Fat Smash Diet at AOL.com.  All right.  If you say.  All right, man.  Radio.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right, Pat.  I'll check you online, man.  You might have to, like, give up the competitive eating thing there, Pat.  Yeah.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You're saying he can competitive eat and still look good?  Yes, yes.  Oh, yeah.  You ever seen Kobayashi? 
[03:47:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, you don't have to give up competitive eating.  Dr. Yen's...  No, no.  Just get the book.  Email me.  Within the next couple of days.  What's an email?  And it will go to work.  All right.  Yeah, all the best competitive eaters are skinny now.  Yeah, I know.  I'll get you down there, man.  Okay, thank you.  I got to run.  Be cool.  All right.  I got to run, too.  We love Pat.  Pat's the best.  He is young.  For old time's sake.  There we go.  We missed Pat.  All our regulars have been staying away lately for some reason. 
[03:47:30]  I don't know why.  The health.  Toxic environment?  Probably.  Constant ridicule?  All right, Ian.  Good seeing you.  All right, fellas.  But we like when the guests have to walk out awkwardly.  Oh, that's not that one.  The hell happened?  I need number nine.  Do you...  Play the sad Hulk walking away music.  Do you have my number?  Oh, yeah.  Let me get it.  It's 212.  Here he goes.  Come on, give it out.  Brad Pitt's number?  Who's going to call?  You have it?  Oh.  You have what? 
[03:48:00]  Wow.  Brad Pitt's number?  Brad Pitt's number.  It's your number...  You know the whole thing where they kept saying it was Brad Pitt's number?  It was some old grandfather.  It was actually Eric's shirt.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Ian, it's your number 917.  Go ahead.  It's Brad Pitt's brother, Yellow.  Is that your...  Yellow.  Thanks.  How the fuck do you stain your armpits that badly?  It's fucking awful.  All right. 
[03:48:30]  It's awful.  He had to put that shirt on this morning and go like...  He had to see that.  He had to see that.  It's like his idea of exercise is he just carries bushels of bananas.  Under his arm.  Holy shit.  Oh, is he awful.  All right.  We got to say goodbye to Dr. Ian.  Put a dab of lemonade under each armpit.  We got to do line of the day and then we got...  Meeting with big, big boss.  Elo.  Oh, some people take lemons and make deodorant. 
[03:49:00]  E-Rock never disappoints, though, man.  He's the greatest.  Take care, buddy.  Good seeing you.  All right.  Thanks, Dr. Ian.  That was fun today.  One runner-up line of the day.  They would taunt me with songs like old E-Rock shirts.  All right.  Runner-up line of the day.  What the hell is in that wallet?  Isn't that wallet?  Fucking cheeseburger. 
[03:49:30]  Even his wallet has to be fat.  Holy cow.  Yeah.  We all live in Eric's shirt stain submarine.  Eric's shirt stain submarine.  I should have stepped on your line, though.  Cheeseburger's great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  That's fine.  All right.  And...  Oh, man.  You tired?  Yeah.  Uh-uh.  Hey, uh, see if Sonny D. Pitts is doing okay. 
[03:50:00]  I want to see...  There's multi-racial children waiting for a drink under his arm.  They all peek into the closet and just stare at his underarm.  Want in?  Ladies and gentlemen, Eric Logan.  Hi, Elon.  Eric Logan.  He's in New York to finalize the merger with Sirius Satellite Radio.  Congratulations.  Ah, how you doing?  Very good.  Very good.  You lost weight.  Yeah, you're looking good.  You're looking fit.  You are.  You're looking good.  It's called stress. 
[03:50:30]  Is that it?  You're on the stress diet?  Yeah, I don't know what...  No things about that.  That one works well.  You don't sleep.  You drink yourself into a coma.  You've been on that for years.  What's different?  It's 40 bourbons and a garbanzo bean.  I don't even know what a garbanzo bean is, but it's very funny.  That's what those bourbons are.  You didn't say, I don't know what that bourbon is.  Yeah, exactly.  It's not the bourbon party dispute. 
[03:51:00]  I wouldn't eat a bean.  Those are unhealthy.  It's carbs.  Makes me fart a lot.  What do you think?  I'm crazy?  All right, you're here for...  Look at that one.  Yeah, who's that?  He's...  This is like the head researcher for the entire company.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, so we get all this data.  He was great in an airplane.  When are you going to allow...  Mayday.  When are you going to tell the world that Opie and Anthony are doing amazingly well for  XM so we don't have to take the abuse?  No, publicly.  We get these speeches behind the scenes.  Send out a press release. 
[03:51:30]  Smells good.  You're publicly now?  Oh, really?  You're on the air?  Yeah.  Oh, we're doing the meeting live?  I don't know.  Well, maybe some aspects.  All right.  What is your position, sir?  I'm sorry.  Well, sir, I am the head of research at XM Satellite Radio.  Head of research?  Yeah.  And this research would entail research on...  The Opie and Anthony program.  Just our show.  Just your show.  I'm hired only for you.  Only to research us.  Yes.  How many more listeners do we have on our channel compared to Oprah's channel? 
[03:52:00]  Oh, significantly more.  Oh.  So why is she getting significantly more money?  Yes.  Let's look at the...  I'm not the financial.  Right.  I think you should call Super Agent Bob Eatman on that.  Nah.  Oh, God.  Oh, jeez.  That's true.  You know, but look.  Oprah doesn't...  She's not still walking on thin ice right now.  You guys.  At any minute, you can all be fired.  And we can just all be in the poor house. 
[03:52:30]  I'll...  What?  What is it?  A receipt for what?  A wire nut?  Okay.  How much was that?  13 cents?  I need a receipt.  God, I hate this studio.  Oh, do you?  When does it start?  Wow.  June 1.  June 1?  June 1.  In fact, I talked to Dr. Masayala today.  You guys should have renderings, hopefully...  What the hell is a rendering?  Oh.  A rendering.  Have those removed.  I like the honeymoon ceiling.  Yeah, it's the same thing I thought. 
[03:53:00]  It's like...  It's our tribute to the Poconos.  It's Mount Airy Lodge ceiling.  Yeah.  Except for the...  There's no splatters on this one.  You could very well be at a gym, if you would.  Well, this is how we solved the problem of light.  Yeah.  Remember, you guys went on vacation.  It was like, oh, it's too dark.  It's too dark.  And then there was a spaceship that was in here.  And I said, screw it.  We meant the neighborhood that the main plant is in there in Washington.  We didn't...  All right.  We got a meeting.  So why don't we do the line of the thing?  Get out of here.  All right.  Line of the day.  Oh.  Here comes... 
[03:53:30]  Here comes...  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  What do you want to do?  You know, watch porno?  I mean, like...  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's exercise on one arm.  That's mental exercise.  Well, that's...  Look at Jimmy's forearm, man.  That's massive.  My right arm and my left arm is a big...  It's Popeye meets Stephen Hawking. 
[03:54:00]  Cock meat.  Nothing but cock meat.  Jim Norton at Caroline's all weekend long starting tonight.  Tonight, man.  I'm going to try to go tomorrow night, Jimmy.  If you can make it, yeah.  I'm going to try.  I just want to let you know...  I'm going to stay out on the island, but...  My wife called.  No one's listening to me.  And offered for you to stay at the house.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, Jesus.  You don't want that.  No, don't do that.  You have an entire basement with your own back door.  You don't want that.  No, because...  Oh, really?  Could he...  If I could sneak out by myself, borrow the car, come back with a friend of questionable  gender. 
[03:54:30]  Hi, Elo.  In the morning, he's scratching his nuts trying to find some fresh art suits in Elo's house.  My poor daughter.  Daddy?  Yeah, what?  There's a strange man.  I got a bandage on my face because the tranny cut me with a box cutter.  Yeah, you don't want...  No.  No, no.  They put me up at a hotel.  I wouldn't impose on you guys like that.  You have a baby and, you know, you...  And he's just got his computer out all the time and he's just jacking pornography. 
[03:55:00]  I'm awful.  Cow talk.  You don't need...  Everything.  Whatever comes across his transom.  You don't care.  Doesn't matter.  Beans.  Doesn't matter.  Research guy wants to talk to us.  Yeah.  We got to go.  Big presentation.  We refer to it in the corporate world.  You want a couple of corporate terms here?  Oh, yeah.  A couple.  New corporate terms.  We have a deck for you.  A deck.  Ew.  All right.  Two dicks with a deck. 
[03:55:30]  What happened to your hair?  I cut it.  I cut it.  He saw this boy's life and he became inspired.  What happened to his hair?  Why don't you look at...  Iraq.  Where's Iraq's hair?  Iraq.  I've been hearing about that.  No, no.  Where is his hair?  Oh, jeez.  Iraq, you'll notice he's carrying two legal pads under his arms.  Iraq, I'm going to get you a raise.  You're not paying him enough.  What is it?  What do you make?  How much money do you make?  That doesn't even matter.  Show him your undershirt.  What happened?  Look at his undershirt.  This is because you don't pay him enough. 
[03:56:00]  Elo, look at how sad this is.  One of the employees...  Oh, fuck.  Look at that.  It's a sweat crust.  His underarms...  The underarm of his shirt is 80 years older than the rest of his shirt.  I can't stress how yellow his underarms are.  It's yellowish green now, I'm noticing.  That's like a pair of underwear that hasn't been washed for a month.  It's really bad.  You ever did bleach or something?  What do you...  How do you wash your undershirts?  You send them out?  What do you do?  Yeah, everything's sent out.  Sent out.  Look, here. 
[03:56:30]  What?  A fucking sewage waste treatment plant?  Here.  What do you send it?  To the highlighter marker store?  Here, take this, please.  Give that to E-Rock.  Oh, buy some new t-shirts.  Nice, E-Rock.  Those are sleeveless.  There you go.  Nothing to stain there.  50 bucks.  50 bucks.  50 bucks.  It was so profitable.  Holy cow.  That's fantastic.  Get some new t-shirts.  Take that one back to the Goulden's mustard plant.  Do you have any gray poupon?  Sure I do.  And he licks his arms. 
[03:57:00]  Take a hot dog and rub it underneath you.  Car crash, E-Rock.  Oh, that wasn't bad.  Oh, yeah.  In the corner.  He knows.  He's got one in his office.  That's my favorite thing when you call, is to hear the lower car crash.  You hear the sound effects through the phone, because he's got one in his office.  Anything else before we go off the air?  No, we've got to talk about the deck.  Okay. 
[03:57:30]  Is it true that cars slow down when you make it on?  Big thumbs up from Sam.  Oh, that was very funny.  All right.  It was a fan special.  All right, lemonade pits.  Gay green's a better cover.  Wow.  Oh, sorry. 
[03:58:00]  You don't fuck with the research guy.  You can skew in the numbers.  You have to be nice to him.  That's okay.  Do you research, not jokes?  Yes.  Let's hear one joke.  I've got nothing.  No, any?  No.  Even from a joke book?  From a joke book.  What do I have?  No, I don't have anything.  Just don't get us thrown off the air.  Imagine the research guy.  Imagine the research guy, because I'm the most heinous, racist joke ever.  He's just sitting here like a gape.  What did he do?  Jesus.  He didn't even get to tell us how well we're doing. 
[03:58:30]  All right, let's get out of here.  Come on.  There will always be retarded idiots to entertain us with their stupidity.  Mindless.  Opie.  Crotch grabbing.  Anthony.  Mindless.  Opie.  Crotch grabbing.  Anthony.  People grabbing their crotches and saying, suck it.  Opie and Anthony show.  Suck it.  Love the show.  Mindless.  Mindless.  Mindless.  Mindless.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. </pre>
