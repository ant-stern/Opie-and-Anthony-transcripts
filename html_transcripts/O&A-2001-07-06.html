<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts expressing extreme frustration with their sales department.  They detailed numerous intrusive demands for excessive sponsor mentions, including for whippedcreambikini.com and a new oxygenated water product,  even going so far as to demand sponsorships for pre-show music and bathroom breaks.  The hosts sarcastically mocked these requests, engaging in several comedic exchanges with callers who shared similar grievances about overzealous advertising. One caller, mistakenly believing they'd reached a different station, was jokingly awarded numerous prizes, including front-row seats to a Donna Summer concert and a trip to space.  The hosts also recounted previous segments, graphically detailing a dominatrix segment, a catfight, and a segment featuring "Jackie the Knife Girl," along with a discussion of a bizarre sunflower-tipped condom provided by a salesperson.  The show concluded this segment with an advertisement for their upcoming road show at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park, featuring the Nerds and a wet t-shirt contest, and a plug for Matt Besser's CD, "May I Help You, Dumbass?", featuring wrong number calls.

The next segment featured prank calls, beginning with several recordings of Matt Besser fielding calls intended for a Barnes & Noble tech support line.  Besser employed various comedic accents and strategies to frustrate the callers.  This was followed by a recording of an irate caller confronting tech support, and several vulgar "FU Friday" messages. A prank call where a woman believed she’d won a European vacation, only to receive steak knives instead, was also played. A humorous, initially staged but escalating, behind-the-scenes argument between show employees Rick and John over warm beer highlighted this portion.  Besser called in to discuss his prank calls and CD, with the show promoting his website (www.uprightcitizens.org) and Upright Citizens Brigade Theater performances. A commercial for Paisano's restaurant concluded this segment.

The show continued with a further promotion of their Stone Pony road show, emphasizing the wet t-shirt contest with a $1,000 prize.  In-studio guest Rich Voss participated, with his feud with Jeff Norris referenced.  The hosts received various calls, including from a 23-year-old stripper criticizing the show, a caller sharing a humorous anecdote about the Marco NSYNC segment, and a caller from Cleveland expressing newfound appreciation.  Sandy Kane, a recurring caller described with graphic detail as having genital warts (with photos allegedly available on the WNEW website), was a major focus, including a song featuring her sound effects. A letter from the Village Voice's Savage Love detailing a woman's dangerous sexual fetish was read.  The "Moms I'd Like to Have" contest was discussed, along with suggestive comments about a contestant, Jeannie. Earl, a frequent contributor, was repeatedly called, his reluctance to participate in the road show's dunk tank leading to teasing and discussion of past awkward incidents, including a potentially racially charged anecdote about a trip to Mississippi.  Further "FU Friday" calls followed,  alongside a heated phone call between Rich Voss and Michael, joined by Jeff Norris, regarding Voss’s comedy.  The segment ended with a caller, Patty, volunteering for the dunk tank and recounting a story about missing underwear from a shared bathroom.

The final segment included calls from “Lottie,” a 15-year-old virgin from Cleveland, and “Stalker Patty.” The wet t-shirt contest was again discussed, along with a plan to dump pig's blood on Stalker Patty if she won.  “Stalker Patty’s” missing panties were mentioned along with the possibility of her participation in a dunking booth or a “lesbian pool.” Lottie engaged in sexually suggestive conversation with the hosts. Several profane “FU Friday” messages were aired, and a Pinnacle Horny Goatweed commercial was played. A prank call recording accusing the victim of downloading pornography, including “a lesbian program,” was also played. The "What Did We Learn?" segment featured listener calls sharing crude observations, discussions about condom usage (Opie stating he uses them, Anthony expressing dislike), promotion of the Stone Pony road show, sponsor mentions, and concert ticket giveaways. The show concluded with a reiteration that “If you want to get laid, you don't want diseases, use a condom. Yeah, Ann doesn't like them, though.”


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show for this Friday.  Toll free 877-692-1027 is our phone number.  We made it to the end of the week.  Not that bad though, having Wednesday off.  Everyone else had the whole week off though.  I know.  I think we're the only people in this building off.  This whole week.  And a lot of people took the whole week off.  Nice little vacation.  Made driving easier.  They really screwed us with the 4th of July holiday. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah.  Being on a Wednesday.  You know, most bosses aren't going to throw you the bone and give you the Monday or Tuesday off or the Thursday and Friday off.  Hell no.  Most people got pretty much screwed over.  You got screwed.  I was talking to one person.  They had to work Monday and Tuesday.  Yeah.  They had Wednesday and Thursday off but had to come back today.  That sucks.  That's a nice boss, huh?  At least you get the hangover cure for the 4th of July.  But then the boss has to know on Friday you're not doing anything anyway.  Yeah.  Well, welcome. 
[00:01:00]  Welcome.  It is FU Friday.  So we'd love to hear from you.  Who pissed you off this week?  You can do that through instant feedback.  You can do it through the FU line.  Or you can give us a call and personally tell us.  877-692-1027.  All right?  Your chance to vent.  I want to vent, Anthony.  What happened?  I'm surprised we're able to prepare for our radio show these days.  Now that we're syndicated.  Now that we're syndicated, it seems like everyone wants a piece of us. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  Oh, God.  I can't believe some of the stuff we deal with before this program.  You would think we're just, you know, hanging out, talking, maybe going through the newspapers.  Getting our finger on the pulse of what's going on.  Right.  That would be nice if we got the chance to do that.  Well, see, the salespeople control the Opie and Anthony show.  And if you know anything about radio, that's a no-no.  It's very bad.  Salespeople should never control a radio program. 
[00:02:00]  They should work hand-in-hand with a radio program, but they shouldn't control it.  Now, people are probably wondering, how could a sales department control a radio show?  I am here to tell you that the sales department around here controls the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  We're going to have to put, like, a guillotine in our doorway that once we're in, we arm it.  Anyone else that tries to walk through it gets cut in half.  Holy Jesus.  How many salespeople? 
[00:02:30]  Well, the day started with having to hear about whippedcreambikini.com.  Right.  They're not getting enough mentions.  They're supplying $1,000 for our wet t-shirt contest tomorrow at the Stone Pony when we do the all-day road show.  So the salesperson comes in and says, you know, they're just not happy.  You haven't mentioned whippedcreambikini.com enough.  Is that what the show should be?  We should just stop every so often and say whippedcreambikini.com?  Whippedcreambikini.com. 
[00:03:00]  See, in the context of the show, when we're trying to do things, and the salespeople come in and say, could you say this?  How are we going to fit it in while we're trying to do something here?  Something fun.  It's not like whippedcreambikini.com gave us $100,000.  They gave us $1,000 lousy dollars.  We've shelled out our own money sometimes.  And I could have went to the ATM machine and shelled out $500 each if we knew it was going to be this much of a hassle.  Right.  So they're bitching.  Because they didn't get enough mentions for the $1,000. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Whippedcreambikini.com.  There.  Supplying $1,000 for us tomorrow.  So then we had to deal with that instead of dealing with our radio show today.  Yeah.  And then...  How many times did you say it yesterday?  We said it like two or three times yesterday.  That wasn't good enough.  That was the questions Ops getting today.  We're sitting in the office.  Of course, I just throw myself into a newspaper or the computer or something and just spin my head around like the exorcist. 
[00:04:00]  I saw you chuckling.  I was laughing, all right?  Because you're in hell.  I'm a real a-hole, though, when it comes down to it.  How many times did you mention it, Opie?  I don't know.  Between what hours?  Because I really didn't hear it.  That's the funny part about doing a radio show, too.  I got to say this.  You know, you try to get feedback on your radio show with the people you work with, with your listeners.  Maybe with the programming staff. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  Maybe your family members.  Just to get a feel for what's working on the show and what's not.  And, of course, if you bump into one of these sales weasels in the hall,  you'll ask them.  Right.  I finally realized that when you ask them, you know, how was the show yesterday,  it is based on whether or not we took care of their client on the radio show.  That's it.  When I'm truly asking, you know, what did you guys think of the catfighting we did the other day? 
[00:05:00]  Or what did you think about me guessing the age of that 52-year-old lady by just looking at her taint area?  Oh, I got to tell you, man.  You did a great read for Sobey Beverages, so you guys rocked yesterday.  Yeah, yeah.  That's all they care about.  Or we'll do a live read, you know, after like a 20- or 30-minute segment, Anthony?  Yeah.  And all of a sudden the hotline rings and it's a salesperson all excited because we did a great live read for them. 
[00:05:30]  Can you make a tape of that?  I need that immediately.  How about the rest of the show?  How about the show?  The actual show?  Um, Alfie and Anthony?  Yeah.  I know you guys, um, you drink coffee every day before the show.  I've been in there and I see that one of the interns goes out and gets everybody coffee.  Yeah.  Um, can we sell that?  Maybe Starbucks would like to, um, you know, get on board and sell that.  As long as you give eight mentions during the day that you're drinking coffee and that you like it. 
[00:06:00]  They are selling everything.  Guys, you take leaks, right?  Yeah.  We have a urinal cake company that would really like to come on board.  Um, how many times did you pee yesterday?  Because we could sell that every time.  They want to like, they want to sponsor What's In My Pants.  Now they want to sponsor certain segments of our show.  It's like, leave us alone and let us do our show.  Not only are we doing, you know, the live reads and, uh, running all the commercials during the show,  but now every little aspect of the show they're looking to latch onto. 
[00:06:30]  See, this isn't going to make much sense to, uh, the new markets,  but, uh, we used to play two songs to start the show just to get everyone in the mood.  Yeah.  A couple rocking songs, you know.  Yeah.  Get you psyched for the Opie and Anthony show.  And, uh, one of our guys, Ben, would do, you know, he would pick the songs.  It was like his little two-song show.  They wanted to sponsor that.  Sponsor his...  Can we sponsor the two songs that Ben plays before your show?  Any, any way.  Tuttle checking in on instant feedback. 
[00:07:00]  What are you kidding?  Preparing for your show?  Ha, ha, ha.  We prepare.  You just wait and see.  So then, uh, Craig comes to me.  Yeah, this is, this is the biggie.  This is the fun that we deal with here.  Craig comes to me.  See, we have to, we have to meet clients.  Yeah.  And, uh, most of them, most of them are cool.  You know, they can hang and stuff.  Uh, but, uh, we, we made an agreement we'll meet clients from time to time.  Sometimes, uh, the people that run these various companies we do live reads for, 
[00:07:30]  they come to the station and, uh, we go upstairs and meet with them for a few minutes  and, uh, talk about the product, Opie, and, uh, how it can fit into our program.  And, um, that's all well and fine because when, how often did they happen?  Once a month, maybe, they'd bring someone in.  Once every, yeah, once a month.  Once a month, I would say.  Once every three weeks, tops.  And we would be like, all right, but, you know, it can't be on this day because we got  something going on before the show that we got to do. 
[00:08:00]  So we were able to pretty much say when we could meet with these people.  Right.  Today.  Today, Craig comes down with the list of clients that we have to meet next week.  A list.  A list.  Next week.  Which would take up every day.  And I hope you guys are following this because, uh, this is what the sales people do.  They get a little and they keep nudging and nudging and nudging and nudging.  You know?  That's what I mean when I tell you that they could completely control our show at this point.  Now we were to meet with three clients.  Three.  Next week.  The first, Sobe Beverages. 
[00:08:30]  Now, come on.  We've met with Sobe.  We love Sobe.  We love the fine folks at Sobe Beverages.  We drink Sobe all the time during the show.  We've talked about that.  We have met with the fine folks at Sobe Beverages probably more than once.  You know?  Because they just happen to be wandering the halls with new product and stuff to drop them  by.  And we say, hey.  Oh, no.  They need a new meeting with us because they have a new flavor.  So we were like, look, if the new flavor is Sobe's new Cure for AIDS beverage, we'll  meet for him.  We'll meet with him.  What the hell? 
[00:09:00]  But, I mean, what, what, why would he have to meet with him?  I don't know.  Do we have to go upstairs and hold their hand?  Maybe let them suckle off us?  Send the new flavor.  We will drink it, enjoy it, and talk about it on the air.  That's right.  Give us some samples and one sheet what it does.  Boom.  I think it is a coddling thing.  That'll save us 20 minutes that we could be spending on maybe talking to our new affiliates  or working on our show, maybe getting more interesting guests.  Oh, no.  They want to snuggle a little bit.  So they want to canoodle in our conference room with us. 
[00:09:30]  So I'm yelling and screaming at Craig like, we're not meeting with Sobe Beverages again.  Right.  Like the people from Sobe, but they don't need us to hold their hands.  Everything is A-OK with Sobe.  Fine.  So I go, what's the next client?  Two left.  He goes, lifestyle condoms.  I'm like, why the hell do we have to meet with people that sell condoms?  Condom people.  I think we all know what condoms do.  I think so.  I go, so, Craig, explain to me why we have to meet with lifestyle condoms. 
[00:10:00]  He goes, well, they want to do a demonstration.  A demonstration?  Unless that demonstration, you know, is a penthouse pet, and me naked, we're not going  upstairs to have a meeting with lifestyle condoms so they can demonstrate how to use  a condom on a cucumber or a banana or something.  All right, guys, we got a couple of girls up here, and now just feel free to, well, we  got some fluff girls, too.  They're going to get you started, and we'll roll the lifestyle condom on your junk. 
[00:10:30]  And now just feel free to plug away at the hookers we brought up here for you.  Right.  All right.  This is a demonstration.  Now, see, the demonstration, we're probably going right back to health class.  Right.  And we're going to be putting condoms on cucumbers.  If they brought a cucumber or a banana, I would be like, oh, come on.  We all know what this is.  All right.  They feel great.  There.  What do we need?  Well, I need them.  So we're not meeting with lifestyle condoms so they can tell us how a condom works. 
[00:11:00]  I would like a demonstration if they showed you how, during the use of the condom, lifestyle  condoms are easiest to get your thumb under the rim and pull it off during sex without  the girl knowing.  Right.  That would be a good demonstration.  So Craig is getting...  Wow.  Snap.  So Craig is getting all nervous and sweating.  I'm like, look, man, you're just a messenger.  I will take this up with our boss, Ken Stevens.  Yeah.  When he decides to come back to work, he's been, I don't know, on vacation for about two 
[00:11:30]  and a half weeks.  Poor guy.  I think we wore him down during contract negotiations.  He's been...  He hasn't recovered.  He's been MIA for weeks.  Has not recovered.  So what was the third product?  The third was for a client from another market.  Yeah.  One of our new affiliates.  Yeah.  Who just happens to be a big fan of the show.  I guess he used to live in New York.  Yeah.  And he's going to be advertising on one of the stations that we're on in another city. 
[00:12:00]  Here's the key to the whole thing.  You and I will never hear the commercial because when the stations go local, they'll just be  playing his commercial.  Yeah.  You and I will not even be voicing his commercial.  He just wants to come up and hang out.  Right.  Well, you know something then...  I don't even hang with my own family.  I'm not hanging with a client from another city.  My brother lives a block and a half way.  I don't hang with him.  I'm not hanging with a client from another city that we have nothing to do with.  He just happens to be a fan.  And then finally, someone comes by. 
[00:12:30]  I'm trying to protect some of the clients.  Some of the clients.  There's someone coming aboard very soon with a new water product.  Right.  It has eight times more oxygen, oxygenated to water.  It has eight times more oxygen, Anthony.  Yeah.  Than this fine bottle of Poland Springs that I hold in my hand right now. 
[00:13:00]  More oxygen, more gooder.  Right?  I think more oxygen means less water.  Oh, is it more oxygen at the top of the bottle?  How else do you get more oxygen into water?  Explain that to me.  Man, we are going to be biting our tongue when we do the first live read for this product.  But how do you get more oxygen into water?  Eight times more would be H16O, right?  Are there 16 oxygen atoms in the molecule? 
[00:13:30]  Isn't that ridiculous?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  So that's what we had to deal with today alone instead of dealing with our show.  Yeah, they want to sponsor when we hang up on our listeners.  This hang-up brought to you by Verizon.  Right.  Todd, what's going on?  How are you doing, guys?  Fat Pat here from Kotex. 
[00:14:00]  I'd like us to sponsor.  Hey, what's in my pants today?  We could get the string or what type it is.  We could talk about it.  That's a good idea.  That's not a good idea.  Sponsor, guess what's in my pants with the...  I also would like to plug WhippedCreamBalloonNut.com.  How many times did you mention it yesterday?  WhippedCreamBalloonNut.com.  All right.  Very good.  I'll be in Anthony.  Very good, Todd.  Thank you, sir.  Thanks, guys.  See you.  All right, bye.  Bye.  You know what we'll do if they keep getting a little, like, pushy? 
[00:14:30]  We'll start connecting their sponsors, all their clients, to events here that they would  not ever want to be associated with.  How about that, people?  Uh, Brian, what's going on?  Brian.  Bad hang-up.  Sponsored by.  We lose him?  All right. 
[00:15:00]  He was bitching.  He wants to hear music.  Then go find a music station, you douche.  Pluto.  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  Summer's Eve.  Hey.  Pre-mixed, pre-measured douche.  Your salesman must be cream in their pants right now.  Why?  You are announcing every sponsor in the phone book.  Why don't you just open up the phone book, start from A, and read down?  Yeah, might as well.  Yeah.  I mean, Jesus Christ.  All we're hearing is sponsors.  Yeah, exactly.  You just sponsor a broom handle for the Motley Crue Challenge.  Not a bad idea.  If they could, they would sponsor the Motley Crue Challenge. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Take care, guys.  All right, Pluto.  We've had it.  We've hit our limit, right, Ant, with that?  Yeah.  Lee, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I'm from Philly, and I love your show.  It just came on here a couple weeks ago.  But, you know, I agree with you with all these sponsors.  Don't do all that, because you guys have too many commercials as it is.  See?  We don't want to turn into another.  Well, I'll say it.  I don't want to turn into Howard, where we take 25 minutes away from the show.  Exactly. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Exactly.  I mean, you know, you've got to pay the bill somehow with the commercials.  But too many is too many.  You know, and I don't want to hear this company and that company for this and that.  You know, hey, don't do it.  All right.  I hear you, man.  Thank you.  Thanks.  All right.  Look at this.  What?  Four?  All right.  Hold on.  Let me go to John.  John.  John, what's up?  Hey, listen.  If I come up with $1,000 cash, you think I could get you and Anthony to talk nights about 
[00:16:30]  me on the radio for about a week?  See, the sales guys would jump on this.  Just getting individuals to come in, hand them $1,000, and we have to mention them on  the air, Opie.  That's a great idea.  How about if I come up with $1,000 to talk bad about somebody else?  Or to talk bad about someone else.  That's not bad.  Oh, I'm sure they're running to the phones right now.  All right, John.  You guys suck.  Thank you.  You know how crazy it got with the salespeople and we had to squash them down?  Yeah.  Because they, like we said earlier, they run the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:17:00]  For a short time, Anthony and I were running spots for an escort service.  Yeah, what happened to that?  What happened to the escort service?  It was only a week?  Well, I'll tell you what happened.  I think the run dates were a week.  I'm not really.  No, I'll tell you what happened with the escort service.  It was under the guise that it's this cute little dating website.  Website.  A dating website.  So we went to the website and, oh, no, it was a full-blown escort service. 
[00:17:30]  This is Ashley.  She'll be in New York City in two weeks.  Right.  Meet her.  Go out to dinner.  Do anything.  Right.  It was a service.  You could pick if you want an Asian.  Yeah.  A fine African princess.  Uh-huh.  A Jewish girl.  Redheads.  Yeah.  Anything.  So we went on the air and we talked about the escort service and they quickly stopped advertising  on our show.  Oh, boy.  Why can't we advertise hookers?  Well, pretty much what it was. 
[00:18:00]  Who brought that one to the table?  Ah, Lewis, what's up?  What a bunch of weasels, these sales guys.  I can picture that advertisement for the oxygenated water.  Are you too fat from drinking regular water?  Well, then we have a new water for you.  It has one ounce of water per 16-ounce cup.  All right, Lewis.  What a bunch of jerk-offs.  Thank you.  It was so funny.  I'm sure the beating frenzy on Lewis's humor will start any minute now.  It was funny with the water, though.  It's like, yeah, it has eight times more oxygen. 
[00:18:30]  Taste it.  Yeah.  Like, I'm tasting it and I'm tasting it and I'm thinking to myself, tastes like water.  Tastes like water.  You know your fish tank?  It's got the bubble filter in it.  And if the bubbles stop, the fish dies.  It's because it's constantly pumping, dissolving oxygen into the water.  That's all they do.  They pump bubbles through it.  But, hey, who are we to say?  All right.  I'm sure we'll drink it and love it. 
[00:19:00]  The second they come on board.  We just had to get that off our chest today.  Thank you.  Thank you.  The water with more oxygen is hydrogen peroxide.  Let me go to Andre.  Andre, what's up?  Yeah, that's what I thought.  Eight times the oxygen.  Isn't that, I mean, I don't know my chemistry that well, but isn't that hydrogen peroxide?  I don't know.  You don't want to be drinking that.  It tastes like it.  It's going to be a lot of damage, you know?  Well, we'll be doing the live reads here in New York for that water and we'll be biting our tongues  and we'll learn more about the water that has eight times more oxygen in the very near future. 
[00:19:30]  Maybe we need to meet with them, Opie, so they can tell us about it.  See, that's a client we might have to meet with because they have to explain this to us.  But how do you get it in there?  But I don't need anyone explaining to me how to use a condom, Anthony.  No.  We're going to have a demonstration in the conference room.  Oh, we are.  Jenny saying, don't you realize Lewis gets syndicated too?  Please stop the madness.  Yeah, I know.  Well, I like the car theft of vice people.  They're all right. 
[00:20:00]  That's at least a legitimate product.  I like it.  Yeah, they had to do a demonstration, which was good because I had no clue what the hell it did.  It sat in the office for a week.  Earl was picking it up, ready to swing it at white people's heads.  That thing actually works pretty good.  Yeah.  All right, and we should take a break.  Do you have an FU today, or did I kind of cover it for everybody?  Yeah, that pretty much covered it.  If I think up another one, I'll spew it.  All right.  We'll go to the O&A archives as we take our first break.  I love this thing. 
[00:20:30]  This stupid lady called us thinking she was calling another radio station.  That old gag.  I love it.  Trying to win Donna Summer tickets, Anthony.  Yeah.  And this is what happened.  We'll be back.  Am I the right caller?  What were you calling for?  Donna Summer tickets?  Donna Summer tickets.  Are you a big Donna Summer's fan?  Yes, but I'm more of a 0.5 fan.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  Here we go. 
[00:21:00]  Here we go.  Let me tell you something.  Mm-hmm.  You're going to see Donna Summer.  You're kidding.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Matter of fact, we're going to put you in the front row.  Absolutely.  For Donna Summer.  What do you say?  I don't believe it.  Thank you very much.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Hey, what color panties are you wearing?  I'm wearing a bathing suit.  Donna Summer wants to know.  What kind of bathing suit are you wearing?  A one-piece, a thong, a bikini?  A bikini. 
[00:21:30]  I'm sun tanning.  Sun tanning.  And I'm by my pool with my radio with 0.5 on.  Oh, boy.  She said that again.  Look at that.  Since she's mentioned the station so many times, I think another prize is in order.  You like the disco era?  Yes, I do.  The whole disco dancing thing?  Absolutely.  How about a disco weekend in Las Vegas, Nevada?  That's right.  You'll be whisked away to Las Vegas, Nevada to see Donna Summer in Las Vegas.  Are you serious?  We are serious. 
[00:22:00]  I can't believe this.  You just have to tell us one thing.  What?  What's the strangest object you've ever used during sex?  The what?  Donna wants to know.  Nothing.  You're a virgin.  No.  You're a big, fat virgin.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm a big, fat virgin.  And what's your favorite station?  25.  She said it again.  Yeah.  You know what you're going to win now?  What?  A trip on the space shuttle.  Yeah.  The first person in space. 
[00:22:30]  You're going to see Donna Summer on the space shuttle.  Isn't this fantastic?  Oh, this is wonderful.  Have you ever been on the space shuttle?  No, I haven't.  Oh, it's beautiful.  Yes.  Fantastic.  It's going to have a big disco ball.  Mm-hmm.  They're going to decorate it all.  Hey, do you know how to dial a phone?  Yes.  What's your favorite sexual position?  Hello.  Donna wants to know. 
[00:23:00]  Hello.  Oh, no.  Is she hanging up finally?  She's gone.  Oh, my God.  It took forever.  Uh, Anthony, we're back live because, uh, we were supposed to take a break, but the sales  people are coming down from upstairs, bitching and complaining.  So they waited the second the on-the-air light went off.  See, they have, uh, taken over our radio show.  Yeah.  Uh, Lisa, you're the condom girl?  Yes.  Why do we have to meet with lifestyle condoms?  Because they want to make sure you know how to use them.  You want to make sure you know how to use them?  Are you going to rip apart my voice again?  No. 
[00:23:30]  You have a fine voice.  Oh, yeah.  No, why do we have to meet with lifestyle condoms?  We just want to meet with you.  We don't want to meet them.  Why not?  All the opportunities are going to get with a combo.  What kind of opportunities are they going to give us?  Are they going to give us, like, stock in their company?  They're going to give you stock.  They're going to give you money.  No, no.  They're going to do all this stuff.  We're not doing cute radio bits here, Lisa.  Why do they want to meet with us?  Because they want to meet the people that's going to be advertising their product.  I don't even hang with my own family.  You don't have to have.  You've got to.  What? 
[00:24:00]  You're so busy now that you're syndicated 10 minutes out of your day?  No, we're trying to put a radio show together.  So?  One o'clock.  You're not on the air.  We've used condoms.  We know the deal.  We know how to talk about them.  What opportunities?  There's plenty of opportunities.  Why?  It's self-explanatory.  If you want to get laid, you don't want diseases, use a condom.  There you go.  There you go.  I don't know, so I need to know.  Yeah, Ann doesn't like them, though.  They're removing the sales girl out of the studio.  There they go.  Oh, but didn't you know that condoms feel much better than just flesh on flesh sex? 
[00:24:30]  Bye-bye.  They are literally carrying her down the hall.  And they're yelling at her.  You can't take 10 minutes on your night.  See, they don't understand.  They think we just go on the air at 3 o'clock and that's it.  She's like, you're not on the air at 1.  You can do this.  No, we get here at 11, 11.30, and we try to prepare a show every day.  Can you meet for 10 minutes with a condom?  Ah, ah, ah.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. 
[00:25:00]  I don't understand why you can't just come in for 10 minutes and meet with a condom.  Ah, ah, ah.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Hey, Tom.  Tom, what's up?  Tom.  Tom.  Hey, Jackies.  Tom.  Look at this guy.  Another hang-up.  You want to bitch?  You know, do your bitching.  Don't just sit there on the phone like a tool.  All right, Anthony.  Ah, ah.  Toll-free, 877-692-1027.

He just comes in with like a case of Sam Adams and hangs with us.  Yes.  Hangs out.  We all drink beer together.  We drink Sam Adams together.  They get the show.  We've had things going on in here that was completely outrageous.  Jim Cook will sit there, dole out the beer, and have a great time.  He doesn't care if he's in the studio for mentioning his product. 
[00:27:00]  No.  Sam Adams.  We don't have to drag him on the air from the corner so he gets a free 5-minute commercial.  No, it just comes up in the conversation of the show because it's something we actually love and enjoy drinking.  Icy cold Sam Adams.  We asked Jim Cook about the lesbian couch.  Guess what?  Jim Cook will talk about the lesbian couch.  He knows about it.  Not about his product.  Right.  Sam Adams.  I wonder who you're talking about.  You'll love it.  Pick some up.  Sam Adams.

And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  It's F.U. Friday.  Who do you hate today?  Give us a call.  877-692-1027. 
[00:28:00]  Jack, what's going on?  Hey.  Yeah.  What is this, F.U. Friday?  Yeah.  Hey, F.U.  And your partner.  F.O.P. and Ampy.  All right.  Opie and Ampy.  That's original.  Yeah, that's good.  Oh, isn't it?  Hey, it's just about as original as that little song you were doing yesterday about the WNBC.  Where'd you get that one from?  I don't know.  Maybe Stern?  Holy Jesus.  That's funny, man.  Hey, Jack, you're such a tool. 
[00:28:30]  That's funny.  Don't you realize we were mocking that from Howard Stern's movie, You Idiot?  Oh, were you?  Oh, were you, Opie?  You're not even smart enough to figure it out?  Opie, and you're trying to make fun of somebody else?  Ha, ha.  Opie.  Anything else, Jack?  They say we had to dump out.  Because he said F.U.  You can't take it.  You can't take it.  Curse.  What a douchebag.  That is really, that's pretty funny, though.  We got a couple emails on that yesterday.  We were totally goofing on the whole WNBC. 
[00:29:00]  Don't people get the joke?  WNBC.  Don't people get the joke?  Because one of our new markets is KXOA out there in Sacramento, California.  And they want you to emphasize the X.  Yeah, we explained the whole thing yesterday.  So because it's in a movie, gee, go figure.  And Howard happens to be on that station with us.  Right.  We're like, okay, they want us to emphasize the X.  So we went, K-X-O-A.  K-X-O-A. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, you're ripping them off.  No, we're imitating a movie.  What a bunch of tools.  How brainwashed can you get?  I cannot understand how you can get so brainwashed that you would become a person that your hero would laugh at.  Oh, my God.  Use your brain for a minute.  They said we were ripping that off.  No, we were making fun of something.  Ripping it off?  Were we using it like it was our own invention? 
[00:30:00]  What an idiot.  Yeah, we just happened to say, emphasize the X.  Oh, that was in a movie, too?  Oh, it's going to be one of those days.  I wouldn't change your dial today.  Sorry.  Howard does happen to be a celebrity personality that you can talk about and joke about parts in the movie.  Believe me, there are plenty of other parts I'd much rather joke about in that movie.  But, you know, that was one we picked.  Hey, Rick, what's going on?  Yo, what's going on, ONA?  Hey, I am a dedicated member of the Army, and I need to give my FU to all your syndicates so far 
[00:30:30]  because all these listeners are being a bunch of effing pussies and not giving the show a chance.  Well, not all of them.  Hold on, Rick.  Yeah, that's not really true.  Philadelphia has come along big time.  We've been on about a month on WYSP.  Things are working out very nicely up there.  And that last call was from Cleveland, and we have early support in Cleveland.  Yeah.  Yeah, you guys are actually right.  It's actually been, what, Sacramento and Chicago that have been the biggest pussies so far? 
[00:31:00]  Well, no, no, no.  No, Sacramento, we've only been on, what?  See, this is the pattern, okay?  Rick, we're going to find audiences in every one of these cities, okay?  Yeah.  Sorry, Seth.  Seth has been IMing me going,  and, dude, we're not markets, we're cities.  We're cities.  So, Seth, sorry.  See, we listen to our listeners.  We're going to find an audience in all these cities.  And if, you know, the other people, they're checking us out and they don't like us,  they'll move on.  I don't care.  All right, no doubt, fellas.  Keep up the good work.  But see what happens when you do go to a new city. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Naturally, they're going to hate you right off the bat  because we haven't really done anything yet.  And it's something new.  We've been on in Sacramento.  This is our second show, and quite frankly,  we didn't really give them a great show yesterday.  But, you know, they'll give us some time,  and they'll sit through some bad shows,  and then they'll get some really good ones,  and then they'll make their opinion,  their decision, if they want to, you know,  become a listener of the show or not.  No doubt.  No doubt, fellas.  I mean, we're already finding our audience in Philadelphia.  It's nice. 
[00:32:00]  It's real nice.  Don't ever forget your New York boys.  Hell no.  We're doing a road show for you guys tomorrow.  No doubt, fellas.  I'll be there all day.  All right.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Peace.  But to make an opinion on a radio show after a few days,  you're crazy.  Because you're going to miss out on a lot of great things.  Guaranteed.  Oralo writes,  Hey, Opie, do you realize that the sales chick just asked you if you use condoms?  And your answer was,  Yeah, I use condoms, but Ant doesn't like them.  And then he writes,  Later, faggots. 
[00:32:30]  I think you, um...  I was so uptight and ranting that, yeah, I did say that.  I like the condoms.  Ant doesn't like them.  I don't like them.  Man, can you find that?  I didn't even realize I said that.  That's horrible.  I got to hear it now, because it went right over my head.  No, Anthony and I are not having sex with each other, okay?  Thank you.  See, that's what sucks.  New York understands.  They've been with us for three years.  They know if one of us says something stupid like that,  he'll call us a faggot and move on. 
[00:33:00]  Faggy.  I don't want the other cities thinking that you and I are, like, sleeping together.  I think they'd get the idea pretty quickly.  All right.  I got to hear that now, though.  That's pretty funny.  Speaking of Lisa,  the condom chick,  one of the salespeople,  whoring her products on our show.  Look at what she gave me.  What is that?  You're supposed to wear this when you're with a girl?  It looks like a sunflower  with some prickly things on top.  It's a sunflower on the tip of a condom.  Oh, it rolls out. 
[00:33:30]  Who the hell is putting this on?  How ridiculous.  Look at that.  She's laughing at it.  Come on.  Come here.  Rachel.  Oh, my God.  If a guy put this on and was coming right for you,  what's coming right for us?  You would have to crack up.  What is that?  That's definitely not heterosexual at all.  Come on.  You would laugh at that.  It's like no one I've ever dated  has ever worn anything like that.  Yeah.  I mean, they'd be afraid. 
[00:34:00]  They'd be like,  no way.  I'm not touching that.  It might sneak a few,  you know,  some of those condoms have little studs on the side  or maybe an extra rib or something.  It's not going to be a flower.  It's not going to be a flower.  A rib or something.  For her pleasure.  But this is like a little flower on the tip of the condom.  Let me touch it.  It's like a sea anemone.  Look at that.  Isn't that great?  Don't you want your man wearing that?  Oh, it's all jelly.  Yeah, but you know.  Before you know it,  it's going to look like a big Pez dispenser, 
[00:34:30]  you know,  with like superheroes heads on top.  I don't think that would be very safe either.  I think it would leak.  You know, that's right, Rick.  It looks like a clown flower that squirts.  You know those clown flowers that squirt?  It looks like it wouldn't be comfortable either  for the lady.  Maybe they're going to explain to us  why that is like the new thing.  Maybe that's what they were going to do.  The condoms with the flowers on the tip.  Oh, condoms.  Look, yeah.  See, look.  It just snapped.  It just snapped off. 
[00:35:00]  The flower did.  The condom's still in one piece, Anthony.  Really?  It is.  Brendan, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How y'all doing, man?  We're doing all right.  All right.  I'm calling out of the Philadelphia area.  I've been listening to you guys  probably just about since y'all started down here,  and I'm very, very pleased.  This is our 22nd show for Philadelphia.  22.  I'm keeping track.  22 whole days.  I'm the rain man of syndicated radio.  You tell me, Mark,  and I'll tell you how many days  they've been on already.  Dallas.  Dallas? 
[00:35:30]  Oh, yeah.  This will be their 10th show.  Columbus.  Columbus is four.  New York.  Oh.  Probably 1,000.  There you go.  We're going to do our 200th show  in Philadelphia, by the way.  Oh, that's good.  That's sometime in October.  We're going to put a party together.  Oh, sweet.  Dude, get the condom off my water.  You know, this water has eight times the oxygen.  Brendan, what's going on? 
[00:36:00]  Well, actually, you just mentioned  what I was calling about.  The gentleman earlier called about the water,  and H2O2 is the hydrogen peroxide.  Yeah.  So I guess with eight times the oxygen,  it's like hydrogen octoxide  or atomic water  or something that's going to blow your colon  right out your ass.  No.  But the other thing,  I'm sitting here,  and again, I'm not a chemistry major,  but oxygen gets into the blood  through inhalation.  We breathe it in.  We do not intake it through our stomachs. 
[00:36:30]  So if this is some sort of new way of doing things,  I'm thinking,  why don't we kill two birds with one stone  and provide some sort of an oxygenation thing  where you can throw a ham and cheese sandwich  into the air that you're breathing,  and you cut down on your eating time?  So basically,  eight times the oxygen means nothing?  I'm assuming so.  I think it's just some sort of ploy  to get the ignorant masses  to throw down an extra buck fifty  at the Wawa or the 7-Eleven.  Thank you, Brandon. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, thanks, dude.  Hey, thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Enough of the oxygen water.  Anthony, the other day,  we were talking about Jackie the Knife Girl.  Yeah, we had some madams.  No, some dominatrix.  Dominatrix, yeah.  In studio to do some catfighting.  Madams.  Well, dominatrix,  which I'm just not into that whole scene.  Whenever they come in,  I'm sorry, I'm skeeved out.  Like, I don't like that whole beating,  whipping, tying up. 
[00:37:30]  You watch the videos and stuff.  Sometimes you get the MPEGs sent to you.  And there's a guy,  he's tied up,  he's got that ball gag.  Once you get that ball gag in your mouth,  that just says you've taken it  right there in the back door.  So you're not into the fetish scene?  Not into the fetish thing.  Definitely not.  And especially the dominatrix part of it.  I'm going to whip you now,  and oh, great, great.  When do you lay down  and I get to violate you?  Well, that one girl was very hot.  That was, you know, 
[00:38:00]  smothering Jim Norton.  Yeah, but she wasn't doing the whole thing  where she was whipping him or something.  No, it's more about smothering him.  That was the smothering fetish.  Move on to the sex part of it, please.  You just want wham, bam, thank you, man.  Not wham, bam, thank you, man.  I like the whole thing.  I like it to last for quite a while,  but it's got to be normal.  Right.  You know, I don't like all the bells and whistles  that go along with it.  It's silly.  You're a traditional guy. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  You keep it pretty regular.  Well, I like getting a little out there,  but, I mean, I'm talking about just with people,  just with your significant other.  Right.  Not bringing in all kinds of circus acts  and flower-tipped condoms  and wacky things like that.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, we were talking about some of the fetishes and stuff,  and he's got it on the side of his head,  like Adebisi.  Adebisi.  With his little hat from Oz.  Wow, an Adebisi reference. 
[00:39:00]  Nice.  Nice.  So we were talking about some fetishes.  Yeah.  And they were talking about,  what were they saying?  They didn't call it cutting.  They called it,  it wasn't cutting.  There was a name for it,  but basically people that get off  having knives rubbed against their bodies.  Dragged on their bodies.  Right.  Not to the point of cutting,  but to, like, scratching.  Right.  Leaves knife marks.  It leaves, yeah,  it leaves slight scratches  like a cat might have scratched you a little bit.  Yeah.  But you're not bleeding or anything, 
[00:39:30]  and people get off on this.  Yeah.  And remember,  we told the lady,  we're like,  whoa,  we had one of these girls in on our show.  Jackie the Knife Girl.  Jackie the Knife Girl.  She liked it rubbed on her intimates  and on her upper half.  Everything.  Everywhere.  Her belly.  And you'd watch the knife blade  pass over her body  in certain parts  and just get all,  I get the heebie-jeebies  thinking something's going to get sliced off.  Yes.  You're about to hear  some of the hottest,  hottest audio.  Hot.  This is a piece of 
[00:40:00]  Jackie the Knife Girl  when she came in and had,  it wasn't even her boyfriend,  it was her roommate.  No, it was her roommate.  With a,  with a huge,  huge sharp knife.  Rambo knife.  Serrated.  Very sharp.  Red knife.  Yeah, very, very sharp.  He also had the Rambo knife  and the Freddy Krueger.  Oh, the fingers.  That's right.  He made a Freddy Krueger glove.  Right.  With all the blades,  real knife blades on a leather glove  and dragged it over her body.  Pretty sick.  Right.  Hold on a second.  Tom wants to tell us  something stupid. 
[00:40:30]  Tom?  Hello.  Yeah.  Yo, what's up, man?  Hey.  I want to know  when you two douchebags  are going to die.  Oh, that's pretty cute, Tom.  They called back  to tell us that.  Well, hey,  I got cut off the first time.  What can I say?  You hung up.  You wasted a long-distance call  to say that?  No, it's pull free, remember?  Oh, yeah.  You got me.  You lose that one, Chief.  Hey, you got me, though.  You know?  You know, it's one thing  when you guys do something original.  Tom.  You know, I turn the radio on.  Tom, I'm not even going to, like,  you know, 
[00:41:00]  spend the day arguing  who's original and who's not.  The originality thing.  Oh, but open your brain up  for a minute.  People that have been brainwashed  for so many years,  they just can't get over it.  And it's not the majority.  You know something?  It's a very small  minority of people.  What you're about to hear  has never been done  on radio before, okay?  Right.  Please.  I mean,  this is as original  as you get, idiot.  Yeah, I've never heard of this.  This is Jackie the Knife Girl  as the knives were being,  you know,  moved all over her body. 
[00:41:30]  Okay?  Just a few minutes of this.  Look at this.  This looks like  the beginning of a snuff film.  Yeah.  It really does.  Rob, can we trust you?  Because that's a Rambo knife.  We're not playing  with bagel knives anymore.  Actually,  the bagel knife is  far better  than the Rambo knife anyway.  If you stab her  and kill her,  syndication's put off  by like, what,  two months?  That would suck.  Five to ten.  Syndication from Sing Sing.  Five to ten.  Yeah.  Syndication  when we get out of prison. 
[00:42:00]  Don't fall  with those knives in here.  Oh, my God.  He almost like  took her head off.  All right.  You've got to work  the Rambo knife, too.  And where's  the Freddy Krueger glove  just for laughs?  Oh, my God.  Look at this.  He's already starting.  Oh, no, Stinky.  Stinky just hit the knife  with the mic  and almost went through her.  Stinky,  get near her mouth more.  Yeah.  All right.  Rob is working  the bagel knife  all over her body.  And we had a lot of request  to be completely silent  for this,  so...  Okay.  I don't know. 
[00:42:30]  I don't know. 
[00:43:00]  I don't know. 
[00:43:30]  I just picked up the pretty girl. 
[00:44:00]  I don't know. 
[00:44:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  You're listening to the sounds of the knifing.  They don't usually bring you the sounds of a girl being stroked with a knife.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[00:45:00]  He's working.  This is a turn on.  Go for her throat.  Oh, you wrecked it.  Hey, I ruined it.  You ruined it.  I ruined it.  What a way to end, though.  Bravo.  Wow.  Nice.  Is that insane or what? 
[00:45:30]  Oh, my God.  Holy S.  She likes that, man.  Andre, what's going on?  Hey, that never gets old, dude.  Yeah.  Never.  That was great, man.  Every time I hear that, man.  Oh, no.  You know what we did?  We did that at a road show in front of 2,500 people on the stage.  Oh, I remember that.  I remember that.  It makes a lot.  We brought her out, and she had barely anything on, and we brought the knives out.  The place was whipped up into a frenzy. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  They completely lost it, because to see it live is just ridiculous.  She goes wild.  She's squirming all over, and she gets up, and she's got, because she's a really pale girl,  and she's just got red scratches all over her.  Yeah, you can hear, like, some fear in her moaning.  It's just, it's, wow.  Hello.  That's amazing.  She gets so turned on by that.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  877-692-1027.  It's toll-free, Anthony.  Yes.  Opie.  Wow. 
[00:46:30]  That's the road show.  Opie and Anthony hit the Jersey Shore tomorrow for an all-day road show at the Stone Pony in  Asbury Park, featuring special guests, the Nerds, and the Ultimate Wet T-Shirt Contest.  First prize winner gets 1,000 bucks.  The party starts at 1 p.m.  Anthony?  Yes.  Bud Light.  Bud Light.  You want a light beer?  Bud Light.  Tastes like Bud.  You know who loves Bud Light?  Somebody that listens over the Internet.  West Coast Dave.  West Coast Dave. 
[00:47:00]  Out in California.  San Francisco, I believe.  He listens every day, and he loves icy cold Bud Light.  Every time I do a read for Bud Light, he instant feedbacks and says, God, Anthony, I love Bud  Light, too, when I want a light beer.  We're going to be on a radio station in San Francisco in the very near future, Dave.  Yeah, Dave, you'll be able to use your computer for games like it's supposed to be.  Bud Light.  Bud Light has no oxygen.  They save the space for alcohol.  Save it for a great Bud Light. 
[00:47:30]  And they have bubbles in it, but it's not oxygen.  That's right.  Bud Light, you're going to the ball game or the beach, make sure you have some Bud Light  with you.  It's the perfect companion.  Don't be fooled by imitations.  For the real taste that won't fill you up, never lets you down.  Make it a Bud Light.  Hour, hour, hour, hour, hour, by Opie and Anthony.  All owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW, New York.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:48:00]  So, it's FU Friday, 877-692-1027.  Hey, man.  Stay beautiful.  Hey.  We're changed for nothing.  George, what's going on?  Nothing.  When I was, I started listening to the show a while ago when this girl was first on, when  she was on over the air.  Oh, Jackie the Knife Girl.  Yeah, she called in.  That was right when this guy did an actual impression of John Madden.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:48:30]  That was Frank Caliendo, yeah.  Yeah, that was great.  Do we have that?  We'll play the Frank Caliendo doing John Madden in a little while.  Thanks, George.  All right, bro.  Thanks.  All right, man.  All right, we'll get it out of the way.  Oh, the computer complaint call.  All right.  We got a CD in today, Anthony.  Yeah.  You and Rick were really, really digging it. 
[00:49:00]  I was too busy dealing with salespeople.  I know.  I just slid over.  Hey, you know what?  Perfect example of what we were talking about about an hour ago.  Instead of preparing for the show, I had to deal with salespeople, and you got to hear  some really, really funny stuff.  Sometimes it's just a matter of, yeah, being in the office, hanging out, listening to CDs  or music, whatever.  It doesn't mean that you're sitting there on a teletype, you know, watching the teletype  come out and getting news like the old days, or sitting there pawing over things. 
[00:49:30]  You know, sometimes it's just a matter of us just hanging out, and I don't think they  get that.  It comes in.  Sometimes they come in.  It looks like just having a party, which we are.  Well, it's part of the show preparation.  Well, that's what our show is.  Yeah.  That's what we're telling all the interviewers.  It's a hang.  It's the Opie and Anthony hang, and the hang starts when we get here at 11.  Right.  And then we just drag all the people from the office into the studio, and we continue.  Me, Crump.  But we got a CD in today called, May I Help You, Dumbass?  Is this going to be for sale? 
[00:50:00]  I have no idea.  I believe so, yeah.  You want to explain to the folks, Rick?  Because I don't know.  I don't know.  Well, I don't know if anybody remembers the show, The Upright Citizens Brigade.  It was on Comedy Central.  Never got the recognition I think it really should have gotten, because there was some  funny stuff on that show.  Yeah.  And a matter of fact, we had them on the day they did the Al Roker prank, where one of them,  you know, jumped up and down with a huge prosthetic attached to his area.  A fake schlong.  Fake schlong.  That was really funny. 
[00:50:30]  So one of the guys, Matt Besser?  Yep.  Matt Besser.  He's got a phone number that's way too close.  Some people have this problem, too.  Their phone number is really close to, like, a business phone number.  And every day, they get calls, day after day, asking for, as this guy got, computer tech  support.  Right.  And, you know, I've got to interrupt you, because it's funny you say that, because this  is a toll-free number we got, 877-692-1027.  Yeah.  There's some lady in the middle of nowhere that had to change her phone number, because 
[00:51:00]  it was one off from our toll-free number.  And people are dumbasses sometimes.  It was a lady that has a lot of kids in college, so she got a toll-free number so the kids could  call whenever they feel like it, call home.  Yeah.  And she called us up.  It was about two weeks ago, and then was yelling and screaming at us, going, I have to  change my number now, because yours is too close to mine.  Sorry.  So anyway, so it's a computer tech...  Yeah, he pretty much plays a part of the computer tech person they're trying to reach.  What a great wrong number to have, too. 
[00:51:30]  If you're a guy, and you're a comedian, because this guy's pretty funny, and you get people  calling your house, computer tech, God, that's great, because you get people that call that  have no clue.  They're really stupid, and he just rags them really bad.  Yeah, and they do a lot of improv stuff, so whenever these come up, it's like child's  play for them.  All right, let's check out a couple of these tracks, then.  This one is called Phrase It Right.  Yeah, track 11.  So this person, obviously, calling the wrong number. 
[00:52:00]  Calling, thinking they're getting a computer tech support guy, and they're getting this  clown.  All right, check this out.  The, you know, place where I just go online, and then it says, of course, invalid password.  Excuse me, ma'am.  You got to ask the question in the right manner, please.  Oh, if I don't ask the right question, you're not going to help me register?  You have to ask me the question in the right manner.  I don't know how to answer it, ma'am.  How do I register a username and password, please? 
[00:52:30]  It's first time.  Do you understand that?  No.  You don't?  If you could just rephrase the question.  You need to ask this in this right way.  Excuse me.  I'm calling the number.  Free unlimited internet service from Barnes & Noble.  And what's your question?  I cannot sign on.  I loaded the software.  I want to know how to register my username and password.  Yes, but what is your problem? 
[00:53:00]  There's no place that it asks me to register.  So, you know, every time I can get online, I've been able to download the local access numbers,  but it's saying, you know, it's invalid password because it's not registered in the first place.  I understand that, but you need to ask me what you need me to do for you.  Tell me where I can find it.  I've downloaded the thing.  Now, where the heck do I do this? 
[00:53:30]  Ma'am, if you're going to start cursing, I have to...  I'm going to download...  I'm double-clicking on Barnes & Noble.  Please don't curse at me, ma'am.  Walk me through this, please, and have me...  Please don't curse at me, ma'am.  Get this going.  Please don't curse at me.  What curse did I say?  You just said, heck.  Listen, you know what?  Buddy, I'm going to complain about you.  I've called you up to ask you a simple question.  You're going to complain about me, ma'am.  We record our calls, and you've been cursing at me and yelling at me. 
[00:54:00]  A real bad curse.  Now, can you please help me get my sign on here?  I have the unlimited Internet service.  It says...  It's right in front of me.  If you ask the question the right way, I can help you.  Is there somebody else there?  Is your manager there?  My manager, I have a supervisor, no manager.  Let me have your supervisor, please.  Okay.  Thank you.  I'm going to get in trouble.  May I have your supervisor, please? 
[00:54:30]  Hello?  Yes.  He's on breakfast right now.  What's the supervisor's name?  Johnny W.  I can't give his last name.  Give me his first name.  Johnny.  John.  And what time will he be back?  He's going to be back in an hour.  Well, he's here, but he's on breakfast.  All right.  Is there somebody else that can help me? 
[00:55:00]  He's not a supervisor.  That's all right.  Let me speak to somebody else.  Maybe they can help me.  Thank you.  I've got to say, I've put in a complaint about you cursing.  Can I please have another person to speak with?  Another representative?  I can give you another representative, but you have to ask me in the right way.  Listen.  Well, then you tell me how to ask you.  This is ridiculous.  What's ridiculous?  Why the hell would you stay on that long? 
[00:55:30]  Because she's trying to get her free something.  Right.  It's all these people that call.  I guess there's this free Barnes & Noble internet access that they're trying to get a hold of.  So it's something free, which is even better because it makes them put up with a lot more abuse.  Morons.  Frigging morons.  I love some of the old tech support things with the people that call up and say, I'm using the foot pedal and it's not working.  Yeah.  And it's the mouse that they put on the floor and they're stepping on it. 
[00:56:00]  But the cup holder doesn't work.  I was like, why is the CD wrong?  The cup holder doesn't work.  Let's go to Steve.  Steve, what's up?  Yeah.  Track 8 is really good.  He pretends he's an automatic operator and it's supposed to be really funny.  Wait.  So is this CD out?  He plays on Saturday nights at the theater.  Uh-huh.  And it's like five bucks.  It's really good.  And he gives out the CD at the end of the gig.  He says, we'll give it for free as long as you pretend to burn it for 10 people. 
[00:56:30]  And he got it for free.  Hey, that's cool.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to talk to him in a little while.  Maybe we'll just put this on Napster or something for him.  Great.  And get it out there.  Thanks, Steve.  Okay.  Which one do you want to hear?  I mean, we could play 8, but we've got a bunch we want to play during the show today.  We'll do one more here before we move on.  Jimmy Stewart.  You got to do the Jimmy Stewart?  You guys are out of control.  Like, why would you stay on the phone if some guy's doing a bad Jimmy Stewart impression?  This person trying to get a hold of tech support calls the wrong number. 
[00:57:00]  And it's Matt Besser doing Jimmy Stewart.  Tech support.  Oh, yes.  Hi.  I'm trying to get on the Barnes & Noble line, and I can't get on.  Oh, what's your problem?  The problem is that every time I try to dial it, it comes up that they can't get through  and to call tech support.  Oh, we've got to be more specific, but we're going to get through this. 
[00:57:30]  We're going to turn this thing around.  Great.  Great.  Okay.  Okay.  So, did you enter your area code?  It seems to be entered already.  Right, right.  You're 212, right?  Right.  That's great.  Let's just stick with me at this, and we'll turn this thing around.  Okay.  Great.  Now, re-enter your area code.  Oh, God. 
[00:58:00]  Cancel re...  Okay.  Um, all right.  Now, the problem is that I need probably to call you on my cell phone, because this isn't...  I have one line here.  All right.  Well, do you use your toolbar?  Yeah, I guess.  What's the toolbar?  Well, you've got to use your toolbar.  That's where your icons are that we're going to have to use to fix this problem.  But we're going to get through this, though.  We've just got to keep your chin up. 
[00:58:30]  Okay.  I hope so.  I'm going to turn this thing around.  Great.  Okay.  So, how do...  The toolbar's the thing at the bottom?  No.  Well, it could be at the top of the bar.  Do you have a Mac or on the PCs?  I have a PC.  I have a Dell.  Oh, that's good.  It's fine instrument.  I also have...  I have the disc.  You know, I have the...  The...  The...  Born to Noble disc.  Oh, you got the disc?  Yeah, and it's...  Oh, the disc.  Oh, that's great. 
[00:59:00]  That's great.  It's not working.  Oh.  The sun's on the horizon.  We're going to turn this thing around.  Great.  Okay.  Put your disc in.  It's in?  Okay.  I'll boot up your computer.  You're going to have to restart your computer.  Okay.  So, you want me to just shut everything down here?  Oh, you have to push on a restart.  You don't have to stick with me here.  Let's keep focused.  Where is that?  Keep focused here.  You're going to have to write it down with a pencil. 
[00:59:30]  Okay.  Where is it, though?  Oh.  Uh-oh.  You don't have to turn off your computer, right?  Yeah.  They don't do it with a button, do you?  Yeah, I do.  What do you mean?  I will.  There's a...  Um, okay.  I got to go to shut down.  That's where your toolbar is.  You got to grab a hole of it.  Okay.  Okay.  Shut down.  Restart.  Oh, grab a hole of your toolbar.  I did.  You want me...  Okay.  I have that.  Now, do you want me to go to restart?  Okay.  You got to stay focused now.  Don't get all upset.  No, I'm not. 
[01:00:00]  All right.  Now, you got to turn it off without you're going to say the restart.  Now, you check restart.  There, there, there, there, there, there, there.  Okay.  You want me to press...  Okay.  I understand what you're saying.  You want me to say press shut down or restart?  Restart.  Okay.  You got to stay focused here.  You'll lose your cool.  No, I'm not.  I'm not.  You got to just take a breath there.  Keep your chin up.  Okay.  You're making me confused, though.  No, well, take a breath.  I'm taking a breath. 
[01:00:30]  All right.  Just calm down.  Take a breath.  No, I just, I press restart.  Yeah, well, calm down now.  You can't yell at me here.  I'm not.  No, I'm not yelling at you.  Okay.  I'm not yelling at you.  It's just, you know, it's frustrating.  Yeah.  You know how...  Oh, is it rebooting?  Yes.  What's happening?  www.dell.com came up on my screen.  So it'll be a minute or two now.  Oh, God.  Making all noises and what have you. 
[01:01:00]  But I left a CD in there.  The Barnes & Noble CD.  Is that good or should I take it out?  It'll say a ROM, right?  Yep.  I don't want to stick a music CD in there.  No, I'm not.  I'm not joking.  No, I...  It'll break your computer.  It's like throwing vinegar on a horse's ass.  Really?  Well, that's a new expression on me.  I hadn't heard that one.  Excuse me? 
[01:01:30]  I haven't heard that, throwing vinegar on a horse's ass before.  Well, you know, try it.  You're going to get kicked in your head.  I guess so.  I don't spend much time around horses, so it wouldn't be something I know.  Oh, yeah.  If you don't spend much time around horses, you end up making a jackass out of your own self.  Well, that could be.  Where are you located, Nick?  Uh, Houston.  Oh, Houston?  Okay, well.  Well, what?  Well, that's...  Where are you from?  New York City.  That's right, the 2-1-2.  Right.  So, you know, we don't have a lot of horses around. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, but you got a lot of jackasses up there.  Well, that's for sure.  That's for sure.  We're looking at 10 inches of snow on Saturday.  Well, I say, you don't look at the 10 inches.  You step down in there, you get out there, and you work.  You shovel up that snow and turn things around.  Oh, you're right.  Okay, now, it came up here.  Yahoo Messenger cannot connect.  Yahoo!  Hee-haw!  That's funny. 
[01:02:30]  That is really funny.  Tony, what's going on?  Hey, Tony.  What is happening with the phones today?  Tony!  All right.  Hee-hung-goop.  All right.  He wanted to hear more.  That's great.  We're going to play more.  It's Matt Besser.  The CD's called May I Help You?  Dumbass.  People calling, they think, tech support, but it's Matt's home number, and he messes  with the people, obviously.  Jackass, man.  We have a bunch of more tracks to play as the show moves along here today. 
[01:03:00]  You know how frustrating that is, too, when you're sitting there at your computer?  Everyone's been on with the tech support, I think.  Yeah.  And they're telling you things, and you're like, look, you've got to slow down, man.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Your brain just starts...  Yeah, it gets you into those parts of the computer that you, like, have no clue.  Go to the toolbar and go on Run.  Hit Run.  Run?  Run, okay.  Now, type in E-X-E-T-O-H.  What am I doing?  Steve, what's going on? 
[01:03:30]  Steve.  Steve, turn that radio down.  Steve.  Yeah.  What's up?  Turn down the radio.  What's up?  That's a really long delay, man.  You're on the radio live right now.  What's up?  What's up, Steve?  Yeah, who is this guy?  It's Matt Besser.  We're going to talk to him in about five minutes here.  Does he have a CDL?  Yeah, but we don't know how you get it, so we're going to ask him.  Okay.  Yeah, this is the first time I've ever heard this on radio.  All right, cool.  Like, no one else does this type of stuff.  Oh, shut up, you idiot.  Go ahead.  Go ahead. 
[01:04:00]  Say what you want.  Anything else?  That's it, dude.  All right.  Rock on.  That's cool.  You can't play CDs anymore on the air, I'll be here.  You can't play prank calls on the air anymore.  Oh, is that it?  I think.  Don, what's up?  Yo, this is the funniest thing I've ever heard in my entire life.  This guy's pretty funny.  I can't get over it.  Oh, my God.  This is so funny.  Yeah, we've got some more tracks to play.  Oh, please.  It's hysterical.  It really is.  Shut up, you sarcastic son of the night.  Thank you.  All right, take care. 
[01:04:30]  All right.  I think it's funny.  I think it's really funny.  The website's www.uprightcitizens.org.  You can go there for some of the pranks, okay?  Yeah.  Where was that?  Oh, yeah, we want to play that.  We have a guy really calling tech support, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  This isn't on the CD.  It's just something else we had.  As we, you know, continue. 
[01:05:00]  Guy was pissed off.  It won't queue up, though, for some reason.  Leaving a message, I think.  Well, he mailed his computer in, and they screwed it all up or something.  So he called tech support back.  I screwed it up.  And he lost it.  Here it is.  Hello.  My name is Stephen Thrasher, and I sent my Canon laptop computer into it.  I just got it back.  Everything that I've written on it for the past few years is gone.  And I was told that you guys were going, that I'd be called if you had to replace the hard drive.  If I called Canon, they said the hard drive didn't need to be replaced. 
[01:05:30]  They just said the motherboard didn't need to be replaced.  And everything that I've been working on for the past few goddamn fucking years of my life is gone.  You fucking assholes.  Now I want you to call me back.  Stop fucking me around and make sure that I get back what I've been working on.  Do you fucking understand me?  And I'm tired of you fucking around with me.  I had better get my goddamn disk drive back.  I'm going to steal all of you fucking pieces of shit.  That was a little pissed off. 
[01:06:00]  Two other guys.  All right, we're going to talk to Matt Fester next as we go to the FU line.  877-692-1027 if you want to give us a call today.  Thanks for calling.  And this is the Opian Anthony FU Friday line.  Hey, this is Dana.  I just want to give a big f*** you to the woman who stole my bag and my social security number  and my sunglasses and my Walkman and everything else of any importance in my everyday life  and has now run up about $10,000 in new credit card bills. 
[01:06:30]  F*** you and I hope the police get you and you die and you suffocate to the smell of burning credit cards.  Bye.  Next message.  I got an FU for Lord Come Over Adolph Giuliani.  That's faggot.  I hope he takes this whiff biscuit and gets the hell out of the crazy mansion.  F*** you.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to send a big FU to my effing wife and the effing guy who effing effed her.  So that's both of you and I hope you effing Ron is effing help.

[01:08:00]  Barb, what's going on?  Oh, nothing.  How you doing?  We're having fun.  You're having fun?  Yeah.  That's good.  What do you got?  Nothing.  Just wanted to say hello.  What's up?  You smoking the weed?  Not right now.  Are you in the car?  Yeah.  And you just decided to call to say hi?  Yeah, because I wanted to tell you that I'm really enjoying your show.  I'm calling from Cleveland.  All right.  Look at that.  Well, thanks, Barb.  We appreciate it.  You like the prank calls from the text? 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  This is, like, so awesome.  I've been sitting here, and I'm like, oh, my God.  I tried calling you earlier, and I had to go into an elevator in my phone night.  So I was always afraid you guys would be all pissed at me.  I was like, whoa, she was up on us.  But, you know.  See, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see,  see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see.  Marijuana is the bomb.  Are you okay back there?  Yeah, we're all right.  That's good.  Fine now.  We're glad you liked the show.  Oh, I'm really sorry about all the assholes that have been calling you. 
[01:09:00]  Small time every day.  Oh, don't you worry about that.  We'll deal with them.  Yeah, we're all right.  That's good.  All right, well.  I've been listening.  Oh, okay.  Well, what, what, what?  Oh, I was going to say, I've been listening, I've been hearing, like, all these people calling you from Cleveland and, like, telling you to, like, F off and stuff, and I'm just, it's just stupid.  You're a girl.  There's just a lot of degenerates in the Cleveland area, unfortunately.  What are you people?  And not too many people appreciate good radio anymore. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, well, thank you.  I just wanted to tell you that I'm really enjoying it, and you guys have been making me laugh all week.  Shut up, Demi.  We're changed for nothing.  Well, thanks, Barb.  You're welcome.  Seems a lot to us.  Good.  Marijuana is an narcotic, medically and legally.  It never did anybody any good, and does everybody a lot of harm.  That stupid voice.  All right, Barb.  Okay, you guys have a good day.  That stupid voice.  Thank you. 
[01:10:00]  Okay.  We're changed for nothing.  Love Barb from Cleveland.  Yeah.  Matt Besser is on the phone, Anthony.  We've been checking out some tracks from his CD.  May I help you, dumbass?  His phone number is very close to a tech support phone number.  Yeah.  Gets a lot of calls at his house, so he decided to start recording them, and we checked out a few, and we're laughing pretty good over here, right?  Matt.  What's up, Matt?  What's going on?  Very funny, man.  Thanks.  Very funny.  We were laughing our asses off in the office.  I love these tools that you get. 
[01:10:30]  It's been happening for like a year.  When did you decide to start taving them?  Well, it actually happened for like a couple of months.  It was literally like a dozen or more a day, you know?  For some reason, people like to do that stuff after 2 a.m.  Are you kidding me?  You know, that's when you figure out your computers after 2 a.m.  But anyway, I actually called up the place, and I told them what the problem was, you know?  And they were like, okay, it was the area code, the problem.  People weren't dialing one before their area code. 
[01:11:00]  So if they lived in Manhattan, they were stupid.  They were not dialing one before their area code and dialing my apartment instead.  Get it?  So the first three numbers in my local number is the same as an area code in Texas,  where they were trying to call.  Right.  So I called those people up and said, you know, let's change this.  And all they do, instead of putting one, they put brackets around the numbers.  So that's not enough for people to understand it's an area code and dialing one before it.  So now it's still going on.  The company has since gone out of business.  But their number's still out there. 
[01:11:30]  With your health, they've gone out of business.  Oh, wouldn't that be great?  So you just started recording with them?  Well, you just effing with them at first, and then you said, hey, let me get a recorder.  Yeah.  I mean, at first I was even being nice and telling them what the problem is.  But actually, it's like, come on, people.  This isn't a new rule.  This is one before the area code, you know?  Right.  There's some secret that's out there.  You were helping people, though, with their computers at first?  I was helping them out, telling them to dial the right number. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, I thought you meant you were actually doing the tech support.  Yeah, just trying my hardest.  I don't know.  You got a screwdriver?  Yeah.  Let's open this baby up.  How can people get the CD?  Well, we have a website.  If you remember, I was actually on your show like two years ago with the rest of my group.  That was hysterical, man.  You were Little Donnie.  That's right.  From the Upright Citizens Brigade.  Right.  And we have our own theater, Upright Citizens Brigade Theater, and our own website.  It's called www.uprightcitizens.org. 
[01:12:30]  Right.  But I keep putting that in, and I'm not getting anything on my computer.  Jackasses.  Well, let me try to help you.  That one killed me.  We just played that one.  We'll keep your chin up.  You pricks.  We'll get through this.  If you have to have someone help you out, it might as well be Jimmy Stewart.  Is that what your logic was there?  You know, he's the nicest guy in the world, and he's always willing to try. 
[01:13:00]  And very hard to get upset.  What's going on with the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater?  Well, we're always doing shows seven days a week.  I'm actually doing this as a show where I play the pranks themselves, plus I read letters  to the editor and goof on that and do some other stuff.  I'm doing that show at our theater.  It's in Chelsea, and you can also get info about that on the web.  And the group itself, we just finished writing our first screenplay.  We're psyched about that.  It's called Merger Machine. 
[01:13:30]  It's about evil stockbrokers who try to take over the world by merging all corporations  together and merging all humans into an army of Howie Longs.  And the UCB try and stop them before everyone's turned into a Howie Long.  I do believe, Matt, you smoke a lot of dope.  You seem to be accusing a lot of people of that.  I know.  And you know, it's not that we get accused of that all the time, too, and we don't smoke.  So you've got some wild ideas there.  So you're going to come in and see us next week?  I'd love to. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, right on, man.  You've got to...  Now that you don't get the calls anymore, do people still call even though they're out  of business?  I still get the calls.  It's still...  The residue of it's out there still on CD...  Free CD-ROMs.  Because this wasn't just one company.  They were servicing tons of different companies.  Barnes & Noble, Costco, Spiegel Catalog, Kmart.  Yeah.  All these huge corporations had this number out there, so...  You have an unlimited supply of material.  Yeah.  You're still taping them?  Yeah.  Cool.  Getting more and more mean and evil to them. 
[01:14:30]  Great.  Stuff they can't get on a CD.  The crueler, the better, man.  You've got to give us some of the stuff you can't put on a CD to listen to, because I  love the real cruel stuff.  Yeah, we did one with a lady that thought she was calling Publishers Clearinghouse.  Yeah, she called our station by accident and thought she was winning this big vacation,  and we totally let her on and then let her really down hard at the end.  I just love it when people are stupid.  Right.  I heard someone earlier make fun of the originality putting out of Prank City, and I've got to 
[01:15:00]  agree with that.  But the thing about this is I'm not calling them.  They're calling me.  Yeah.  You know, and I feel like people kind of deserve it more when they're being the dumbass,  you know.  Right.  They deserve the punishment a little bit more than just the innocent victim of the  jerky boy or whatever.  Are you into computers at all?  No, not really.  I mean, I use email as much as anybody else.  Because it's hysterical, and you're like, go to the toolbar.  Right.  I just hear some smashing on the keyboard like you're actually typing something in real quick. 
[01:15:30]  Well, another one of the ones you don't play, and I run a few of them.  I don't think you played this one, though.  I say, okay, I'm hacking into your computer right now.  Yeah, that one is great.  I'm hacking in.  And I just give them some, you know, I just, I hit the keys, and I hear the keys going.  So they're like, oh, you must, I can hear the keys.  You must be hacking in.  Which one is that?  I do that on the second one.  I call Lesbian Download, where I accuse the guy of, I can see there's lesbian pornography 
[01:16:00]  inside his computer, and that's why he's not, nothing's working for him.  Like, if you could call up a tech guy, and then he could say he's hacking into your computer,  right then I'd be like, what is this crap, man?  You know, I did it for like, or I've been doing it for like a year, and I've only had  one person call me out saying I'm full of crap.  Really?  Yeah, and it was that very thing.  He was like, wait, how does this work?  People are so desperate when they're calling for help.  It's a great fodder right there.  You could just nail them.  Oh, like one of the ones I just did that's not on the CD, like, you know, this is an old 
[01:16:30]  joke, but just, I was just using a horrible Asian accent and just going, ching ching chong,  ching chong, ching chong, and they would not hang up.  They were just, they just wanted to battle through this nonsense and get some info out of  this person, and then I hung up, and then they called back again, and then I had a Frenchman  get on, eh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, just babbling nonsense. 
[01:17:00]  They're still just determined, what are you saying?  They want the help so bad.  It's free.  Anything free, people got to have.  That's what we were saying.  If it's free, man, they will stay on the line.  Give it to me.  Yeah.  Very cool, man.  Hey, thanks.  We're tracking through it and just laughing our asses off.  Cool.  Yeah, Matt.  Come in next week.  Yeah, well, come see my show, people listening.  Our theater is in Chelsea.  You can look up the show in timeout.  I think it's listed, but it's 11.30 this Saturday.  Okay. 
[01:17:30]  And you can get the CD by going to www.uprightcitizens.org.  Yeah.  All right, we're going to play a couple more tracks here.  All right.  Cool, Matt.  Thanks, Matt.  Try playing track eight.  Eight?  Yeah.  Automated operator?  Right.  All right, we'll play that one.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Have a good news, Matt.  Bye.  A lot of people like track eight.  Well, we got the last day on the job queued up first here, so why don't we do this?  Wrong number.  Call in Matt instead of tech support.  I need your primary dial-up number if I'm going to start the transaction to get you onto 
[01:18:00]  the Internet.  Oh, uh...  Just a moment.  Just a moment.  What?  Yes, I'm handling this one.  I've got it.  I have it.  I'm on...  Yes, I picked it up.  I do know how to do this.  What?  I do know how. 
[01:18:30]  I'm sorry, what?  Go ahead, ma'am.  Who might speak to?  Tech support 72.  Okay.  You have a very, very peculiar way of dealing with customers.  I'm sorry, ma'am.  I haven't started dealing with you yet.  I was talking to the gentleman I'm working with.  Okay.  I just got this free Internet thing through Barnes & Noble.  Hmm.  What?  I'm not aware of the free program.  I'm just the tech support.  Just a moment.  Yes. 
[01:19:00]  Well, you didn't tell me about the free program.  Hey.  Screw you.  You didn't tell me about the free program.  F*** you, man.  You didn't tell me about the f*** free program.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead, ma'am.  That's no way to talk on the phone.  Oh, did you hear that?  Of course I did.  I'm sorry.  I thought I put you on hold, ma'am.  I'm sorry you had to hear that.  I don't understand this kind of business. 
[01:19:30]  I'm just trying to get the sponsor.  Well, to be honest, this is my last day on the job, so I don't care if I get fired.  Okay.  Would you give me someone else, please?  Fine with me.  She wants to talk to you.  Hello?  Where am I calling?  Tech support.  Tech support.  What's your problem?  I was just trying to... 
[01:20:00]  I feel like I'm on a...  Anyway, I was just trying to put on the Barnes & Noble free internet service.  Okay, ma'am.  We just started that free service, and we are just tech support.  We do not know anything about the free service, unless you're talking about your primary access number.  Uh, I don't know who you are, or what kind of service this is.  Thank you very much.  We are tech support. 
[01:20:30]  But I don't understand.  Um...  Just a moment, please.  Okay.  Put that down.  Put that down.  That is very expensive.  Do not, do not...  Do not show your finger.  I'm sorry, ma'am.  We're...  These internet businesses, you know, we're just getting off the ground.  Obviously, you're not going to get off the ground.  I can't believe I'm talking to real people that are talking to me like this. 
[01:21:00]  I'm not talking to you, ma'am.  I was talking to the man I work with.  I know, but he was talking to you before, and I was hearing everything.  Well, our mute system isn't working.  Uh-huh.  Now, is there anybody else in this office?  No, ma'am.  We're just the two.  It only takes two to do tech support.  But we have nothing to do with the free program, like I keep telling you.  Oh, I see.  Do you have a tech support problem?  Well, I can't. 
[01:21:30]  I started putting myself...  I started doing...  Screw you!  No, you screw off.  Hello.  Sorry, go ahead.  Do you...  Do you...  Do you...  I can't believe these people stay on so long.  Because it's free.  That's funny.  That's it.  Not bad.  Do we have time to play one more before we take a break?  Matt wanted us to play what?  Track 8?  Automated Operator?  Yeah.

[01:27:00]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Toll free, 877-692-1027.  Oh, brother.  So wrong.  We've got to explain it now.  So wrong.  Somehow.  What?  They're still continuing.  Rick is such a prick, man.  Can I just put this up? 
[01:27:30]  Put this behind us, and let's finish the show right, all right?  Good and strong.  I just finished.  You've got to let him off the hook, man.  I can't imagine.  I don't want him walking around thinking I'm a prick.  Rick, you're the worst.  You are so bad, Rick.  Rick, you are so bad.  Oh, my God.  Man, explain what just happened.  Is he crying? 
[01:28:00]  He was close.  Oh, you are so bad.  Get John in here.  Explain what was going on, Ann.  Well, during one of the breaks, sent John out to get some beer, because our fridge is  out of beer, and he gets some.  He brings a bottle in here, and it's really, really warm.  His eyes got so glassy.  I hate you so much, Rick.  I swear to God.  It's like really warm.  So, you know, I'm like, oh, boy, I really like cold beer. 
[01:28:30]  Especially on a Friday.  On a Friday.  It's nice, you know.  And John went and got the beer.  So, when he gets back, we're like, John, it's warm beer.  You know, I'd rather have bad beer that's cold than good beer that's warm.  Unless, of course, it's Sam Adams.  And Rick thought it would be funny to bring him into one of the other studios, turn on  the mic to record it, and bitch him out about bringing warm beer to me.  Like, I care. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, but then he starts...  Like, I care.  But then he starts bitching about all the other things I guess John doesn't do right.  I know.  You're the worst, man.  You're the worst.  Rick, it started sounding a little too real, like you were really giving him crap.  Well, no.  I had to do that because I didn't want him to think, he's harping on this a little too  much.  What's the real deal here?  No, I think just the beer thing would have been great to just keep pounding him on the  beer.  But then they start talking about other things he does wrong on the show.  He just left one CD out one day and that was it.  So, I just used that as a reference point. 
[01:29:30]  A, B, C, and D.  You don't go A, B, D. What the hell are you talking about?  I might have to dump out of this because you were cursing, but let's see.  You have to be taken care of.  All right, so this is audio of Rick in the other studio with poor John.  You have to be taken care of.  I mean, bringing him...  Stinky sticking his head in.  Just tell him to set it up and it should be fine.  All about you?  No.  It's the feed that's coming from...  Oh, see, Stinky just went in to tell Rick, we really can't hear you in the other room. 
[01:30:00]  Right.  It's not triggering.  He didn't realize this was part of the bit.  We were doing this setup on John.  He just said, it's not feeding.  All right, where does this start then?  Do you know, Ben?  It takes a while.  It takes a while?  Yeah, and then I brought the mic up, so...  Because he was sitting too far away from the mic and I couldn't say stand in front of  the mic.  Huh?  All right, well, we'll play it later.  We'll have to edit it at the end.  Yeah, get it to the right spot.  Rick said you were almost crying. 
[01:30:30]  Dude, I was buying it for quite a while and then it occurred to me that the mic was right  in the middle of us and Rick was coincidentally standing right in front of where I couldn't  see that the mic was on.  I was like, wait a minute.  But, no, he was...  No, no.  He's such a lie.  You came out and you heard them saying that, oh, I feel bad.  And you're like, oh, it figures.  Like, you finally figured it out after the whole thing was done.  He figured it out as he's walking out of the studio.  He looked over.  He saw the mic thing up.  The thing that was so bad was, like, Rick was doing, like, the silent game with me. 
[01:31:00]  I didn't know what he wanted to say.  And he would just stare at me with, like, this cold look.  That's the stare.  What are you going to do?  And then nothing.  I'm like, uh...  Get cold beer.  I'll take it back and exchange it if you want.  Darren, what's going on?  Hello?  Hey, Darren, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  You're on the radio.  Hey, no, it's Aaron, man.  Hey, Aaron, what's up?  What's up?  How are you guys doing?  Hey, I've got to tell you something.  I just moved up from Baltimore six months ago.  Yeah. 
[01:31:30]  Right?  I never heard of O&A until about two months ago.  Sorry to listen to you.  I shut you guys off when I first heard you.  Oh, right on, man.  Nah, man, but I'll tell you what.  Two days ago, you did this skit about the kid on the moped?  Yeah.  I know that kid.  He was in my old neighborhood.  Yeah, everyone remembers that.  Yeah.  Hey, hey, do a little dog barking and wheezing for me.  All right, Aaron, thank you.  Oh, my God.  Okay, look, this is what we're going to do.  We've got to find...  It's right here?  All right, this is Rick yelling at John. 
[01:32:00]  I think we found it on the tape.  What did Anthony ask you to do?  I can't even...  Go get beer.  Okay, and what did you bring him?  It was warmer than I thought it was, Rick.  Do you understand?  He's making a joke, but it's not a joke.  He's serious.  He was complaining about this yesterday with the warm beers and beers never in the refrigerator.  I mean, John, you've got to step up, man. 
[01:32:30]  Come on.  How long have you been here?  How long have you been here?  What?  Six months.  Six months?  Yeah.  And?  And I don't know what you're asking me.  Yes.  John, do you want to be here?  Oh, no.  Absolutely.  Do you enjoy this job?  Yes.  And you know some of the crap we have to deal with?  Yeah.  I mean, it's not your fault, so to speak, but it is.  I mean, these guys have certain demands that need to be met every single day. 
[01:33:00]  Like beer.  Right?  Yeah.  Some of which entails doing crap work, like we have to do sometimes, which means going  out and getting cold beer.  I mean, he's making a joke about it, but believe me, he's not really that happy about  it.  Oh, that's true.  It's the little things.  You know what?  It comes down to the little things.  Like stand up.  Stand up.  Like if someone says, look, here's what I want you to do, A, B, C, and D. You've got 
[01:33:30]  to do A, B, C, and D. Don't do A, B, and D and think, well, you know, that's close enough.  What the hell are you trying to tell this kid?  What is A, B, C, and D and then skip and see?  Wait, what?  I had to lure him up to the microphone, so I needed him to stand up for a reason and try  and do something.  Stand up as I A, B, C, and D.  I had no other way to get him to the mic. 
[01:34:00]  Everything has to be done the right way the first time or else somebody's going to get  their ass chewed out.  I mean, you're bringing in cold beer.  You're supposed to be bringing in cold beer and you're bringing in freaking piss water.  I'm sorry, Rick.  I didn't...  But I mean, that's the type of thing.  It happens time and again.  You leave CDs out when you're making copies.  See, you're just supposed to make fun of the beer. 
[01:34:30]  The beer.  Now you're bringing up stuff that actually bothers you about the poor kid.  No, it doesn't bother me.  It happened once and he ran and grabbed the CD and that was it.  We never brought it up again.  But I had to grab something else so he wouldn't look at me like, he's droning on this too much.  West Coast Dave, Rick Hitler.  Everyone's bashing on Rick now.  Things are brought in the next day.  Oh, John left this.  Now it's the beer.  What's the next thing going to be?  You know?  If it's not one thing, it seems to be another.  You're heading down the Jesse Road, dude. 
[01:35:00]  And I want to see you go down the Jesse Road.  You know, where things just weren't happening.  Okay.  So how are you going to fix this?  I just won't.  Just take your advice.  Oh, no.  Oh, no, John.  John, you should just look him in the face and go, Rick, go F yourself, man.  You know something?  That's where you just punch him as hard as you can in the middle of his head. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, man.  I can't believe you took it.  Wow.  Now, John, keep in mind, they signed off on this idea.  And they said, yeah, go for it.  John, what were you thinking, though, in your head when you said, I'll take your advice?  In your head, it's like, this frigging pompous schmuck, man.  Yeah.  More like.  Yeah.  I'll take your advice.  I got to hear that again.  So how are you going to fix this?  I just won't just take your advice. 
[01:36:00]  Take your advice.  He didn't give you any advice.  I know.  He said nothing.  Wait till he gets part of making lists.  Exactly what you're saying and not let stuff like that happen anymore.  Well, what are you going to do about the beer situation, dude?  I told Anthony I will go right back out and I'll even, like, I'll bring it.  You know how he gets.  Oh, my God.  What are you insane?  You know how he gets.  I got to hear how John answers.  Yeah, like, gets a good buzz on. 
[01:36:30]  Hold on.  This could be fun.  I'll go right back out and I'll even, like, I'll bring it.  You know how he gets.  I understand.  He likes to have a good time, but he also likes to have things done.  He doesn't like to say things twice to people.  That's why he's such an easygoing guy, because he does things, you know, where, yeah, he can be very cool,  but, you know, he can be as big a dick as the next guy.  I'll, uh, I'll, I'll, if, if it's really that big of a deal, which obviously it is, I will.  It's not just the beer, man. 
[01:37:00]  It's just we see things happening time and again.  You suck, man.  Rick, you don't, Rick, you're an awful worst.  I like how you tried to bait him into saying something bad about me, you know.  It's like, yeah, he's easygoing and stuff, but, you know, he could be as big a prick as the next guy.  Yeah, yeah.  I was waiting for it, John.  It was funny, because the whole time he's just, he's just, he doesn't know what to say,  and I'm trying to draw stuff out of him and leave him, like, huge blanks for him to fill in, but he wouldn't do it.  But he's just going to take your advice.  All right, let's, there's a little more here. 
[01:37:30]  I'm trying to alert you to the fact that you're heading down the Jesse road.  Okay, well, I won't then.  And every, what you're saying to me right now is sinking in, and I won't fix everything.  Oh, no.  How are you going to fix everything?  Are you going to make a list for yourself?  Not going to make, if I have to, yes.  Oh, God, no.  John.  Oh, my God.  I would have so much respect for you if you punch him in the ass.  You know what?  No, to John's credit, when you're sitting there in front of, like, one of your bosses or superior or something. 
[01:38:00]  F that.  No, I would, I would have to hit him.  You know something?  I would have to hit him.  I've gotten bitched out by bosses, though, and it sucks, and you do just got to stand there and grit your teeth and say what they want to hear,  and then you're just like, this son of a effing, God, I hate this guy.  And if you recently watched one of your peers get cut down in much the same manner.  Jesse.  The Jesse road that Rick was talking about was a former intern, Jesse, that did get the boot.  Yeah, we finally gave him a paying job, and he said that the power in his town went out, and that's why he couldn't make it to an appearance. 
[01:38:30]  The Jesse road.  And it turned out he was the only one that lost power.  Wow.  All right, there's just a little bit more here.  I will.  Well, because it has to be done just like ABC and D.  ABC and D.  If it's not, they're going to say, well, we've got to cut him loose.  Do you want to be cut loose?  No.  I mean, there's an opportunity here for you. 
[01:39:00]  Absolutely.  I know.  I don't want to leave.  I don't want to leave.  You see what I mean?  I got no place else to go.  I got no place else to go.  I don't want to leave.  Don't you do that.  Don't you do that.  I got no place else to go.  Mayonnaise.  I got no place else to go.  Don't you do that. 
[01:39:30]  At the end of this, it's great.  Rick picks up John to win beneath my wings or whatever.  And carries him back into the studio.  Listen, listen, listen, listen.  I don't want to leave.  No.  I don't want to be let go.  Okay.  So we have an understanding now?  Thank you.  Okay.  Let's put this behind us and let's finish the show right, all right?  Put my foot behind you, you son of a bitch. 
[01:40:00]  That's what I was thinking.  Put this behind us.  I'll put my foot behind you.  You bastard.  Oh, Rick.  You suck, man.  You're the worst.  Oh, screw you.  You guys told me to go ahead and do it.  You should have just stayed with the beer, though, man.  Oh, look at you.  Psychomark.  Psychomark.  What a tool.  What a total tool.  Well, John, you should have taken a six-pack, fired it off his head, and then go back to  the V8 case.  Yeah, okay.  Go back to the V8 case. 
[01:40:30]  I can't care.  I want my job.  Dude, don't take that from Rick.  Come on.  Oh, it's hard.  That would have shamed assault, you know?  Oh, man.  People just made it turn it off, turn it off.  Like it was cringing to listen to.  Of course it was.  You're just brutal, Rick.  You really have no heart.  Man.  Poor Kim.  It's freaking beer, dude.  It's beer.  You should have put a big hair on the beer and gave it a hand to me.  Bye, Mac.  Bye.  Bye. 
[01:41:00]  There you go.  Psychomark.  Let's go to Jim.  Jim, what's up?  Hey.  I'll tell you this.  John's a better man than I'll ever be.  I would have pummeled that 5'2 Puerto Rican in three seconds.  John, God bless you, man.  Thanks, dude.  Yeah, I would have punched him.  I would.  Or at least just turn around and go, you've got to be assing me.  No, because Rick always does this type of crap where he gets like really, really serious  and I'm scared at this point not to buy it.  You know what I mean?  So like the one time where I do like just wail on him, that's like, all right, you're  really fired. 
[01:41:30]  Doug, what's going on?  What's up?  Rick, you would have been knocked out in 30 seconds and I would have been collecting  unemployment for the rest of the summer, you Spanish hoodlum.  Wait, Doug, let me add something to the equation.  John doesn't get paid.  He's just interning.  And that would have been even more.  That's what I mean.  He wasn't even losing a paying job.  You were getting abused for no money, baby.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sorry, Rick.  I guess you're a cool guy, but you would have had a black eye.  All right, Doug.  Thank you.  Gustavo Rick.  Let's go to Dan.  Dan?  Dude, Rick sounds like the next door neighbor's father in American Beauty. 
[01:42:00]  When he's berating him, he just sounds exactly like, I'm expecting Rick to be banging  on my garage door trying to bang 20 minutes from now.  Right on, man.  Where do you live?  Jason checking in.  I have to admit it, but I hate to admit it, but Rick's good.  I feel like I should be getting Anthony beer.  That's the worst.  Oh, man.  You're awful.  That's good.  Rick sounds like Mike Brady yelling at Craig Brady.  It did. 
[01:42:30]  Now, Craig.  There they go.  Look, a little handshake.  Now, I'm done.  He's carrying him out like Officer and a Gentleman.  Rick, I got the gold.  Put the intern down, Rick.  John?  Could you run out and get some cold beer?  Beer.  Okay.  All right.  You got any money?  You need some money?  These guys ride this kid.  He looks so hard, man.  Oh, we do not.  Yes, you do.  We mess with him and he knows.  John, do they ride you hard?  Who?  Rick?  The whole gang. 
[01:43:00]  Ben?  Definitely not as bad as it used to be, no.  All right.  Nothing better, then.  Yeah.  All right.  Just make sure.  Cold.  Yes.  That'll be great.  Anthony, we found the publisher's clearinghouse call.  All right.  We were talking about wrong numbers and things like that.  Yeah.  There was a time a lady called us while we were working on the air.  Yeah.  And she thought she was calling publisher's clearinghouse and she thought she won a really,  really big prize.  Tool.  Hello?  Yes, I'm calling. 
[01:43:30]  Is this ******?  Yes, it is.  What can we do for you today?  Yes, I just got a call.  Yes.  And he gave me my claim number.  Uh-huh.  Because I won a prize.  Yes, you did.  What claim number did you get?  Uh, 654.  654.  321.  321.  6J.  6J?  Yeah.  Ooh.  Pretty excited, are you?  Yeah.  Yeah?  You ever win anything before?  Never win anything.  Hold on, please. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, okay.  Dude, tell her she won a European vacation.  Hello?  Hello?  That is coming up as a European vacation.  A European vacation?  Yeah.  He had told me something like $10,000.  I wish I were you, as a matter of fact, because it's a European vacation for your family plus  $10,000 in spending money.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Uh...  Are you psyched?  Uh, yeah.  I'm like...  I'm like shaking. 
[01:44:30]  This is...  This is...  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Hold on.  Uh, we have our supervisor here.  Okay.  He's gonna need, uh, I guess some information, maybe.  Hold on.  Hi, ma'am.  Yes?  Hi, this is John Huber, Bill's supervisor.  Can I have that number once again, please?  We gotta verify that you are, in fact, the winner.  Yes, it's, uh, 654-321-6J.  6J?  Yes.  I thought you said A, John.  You thought she...  I thought it was an A. 
[01:45:00]  Oh.  It's 6J?  It's 6J as in, uh, jump.  All right.  We got some good news and bad news.  You're still the winner.  Okay.  But, uh, your prize is a set of steak knives.  A set of steak knives?  Yes.  The European vacation for you and your family and the $10,000 spending money is for 6A.  Oh.  And you'll have to pay for the shipping on the, uh, steak knives.  Oh, all right.  And that's $19.95.  Okay.  Would you like to, uh...  Uh, no, thank you.  Oh.  Okay.  That's okay. 
[01:45:30]  That's fine.  Okay.  Well, thank you anyway.  Okay.  Oh, that was way too painful, man.  Oh, poor girl.  Opie.  Wow.  I'm really a show.

[01:47:00]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Toll free, 877-692-1027.  In the studio, Rich Voss.  What's happening?  What's up, Rich?  You know, uh, Rick was right about that comedy comparison about ABCD.  Yeah.  Except when you listen to Norris, and it's H-A-C-K.  Oh, God, right off the bat.  The ongoing war between, uh, Rich Voss and Jeff Norris. 
[01:47:30]  Jeff Norris.  I get that out, you know.  Continues.  Very nice.  Creep calls in.  Rich is going to be at the road show tomorrow.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  We're doing an all-day road show at the Stone Pony.  It's going to be unbelievable.  Oh, hell yeah.  Uh, we're hoping a lot of people from Philly come on up to check it out.  To the other cities.  We'll get to your city eventually.  We'll get to you.  Yeah.  You know, it's interesting.  John, the intern, he just, uh, actually applied to be, uh, Gary Condit's, uh, intern.  He thinks it'll be easier than working for Rick. 
[01:48:00]  Hey, those road shows are great.  That one in Long Island.  Yeah.  How much fun is that?  Tomorrow, um, I think there's going to be about three or four thousand people there.  It's going to be insane.  Oh, yeah.  We've never been to that area.  It's going to be incredibly insane.  Outdoors.  It's just going to be sick.  And plus, there's so much history at the Stone Pony.  You know what I mean?  It's just...  Yeah, but who cares about the history?  I don't.  I just feel like talking.  Uh, I don't care at all about that.  Who cares about the history?  History.  We'll make new history tomorrow.  We're going to have a party.  Yeah, but I'm saying it's a great place.  First Springsteen started his career there. 
[01:48:30]  It's a great place to do that.  Care.  All right.  Um, why don't I have cold beer yet?  Like, I wasn't joking when I did say I could use some.  It would be nice.  You want me to go yell at him again?  Um, yeah, Rick.  Go, go.  Go.  Kelly, what's up?  Hey, uh, yeah, what's going on?  Wait, you're supposed to be a girl.  Um, no, my name's Kelly.  It says, Kelly, 23-year-old stripper, why we call sluts. 
[01:49:00]  Why are we called sluts?  Yeah.  You gotta...  I'm called a slut.  I don't like it.  It sucks.  You're a stripper?  Who the hell answered your phone call?  Probably John.  Stinky.  It was Steve Dave.  Stinky.  He had, he had his girlfriend's call or something.  Like, I have a girlfriend.  Come on now.  So, what?  What's your point?  Kelly.  Yeah.  So, what do you want to say on the show? 
[01:49:30]  You obviously went through all this to get on the air.  Say something.  Why the hell do you guys suck so bad?  I don't know.  Just keep...  You're listening, aren't you?  Yeah, because it's pissing me off.  I want that.  Well, keep listening.  Well, at least they don't swallow like your girlfriend.  That's what happens every time.  Creep.  They get on and it's like, God, I'm so pissed off that these guys are on.  Why do they listen?  When I'm listening and I hear people call in and they're, you know what?  That really pisses me off.  You don't want to listen.  You don't listen.  But the thing is, they keep listening. 
[01:50:00]  Listen to the music.  Craig, what's going on?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Good.  Welcome to Philadelphia.  Oh, thanks.  Never really heard about you guys before.  But 4th of July, I'm sitting around.  White leaves me for a crap show.  And I heard the whole Marco NSYNC thing.  Oh, where the gay guy had to eat the...  Eat the peach.  Eat the peach.  That was hilarious.  I had to send my 13-year-old daughter away.  Oh, thanks.  Send her here.  Hey, give her a few years. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, we will.  But I'm going to see you at the Stone Pony tomorrow.  Okay.  And I'm now a loyal listener.  Oh, thanks, Craig.  We appreciate that.  Bye-bye.  All right.  There you go, Ann.  You got your cold beer.  I see cold.  We can finally move on with the show.  You're happy again.  That's not beer.  That old gag.  We have a Sandy Cain song from Brother Joe.  Yeah, Sandy Cain, just a disgusting waste of life.  Been on the show a few times.  She's really rude, disgusting. 
[01:51:00]  She's 75, 80 years old.  I don't even know.  Why don't you guess her age with the taint thing, Opie?  Take a look at her taint.  She's like 60, early 60s, I think.  That vaginal warded.  She's worked at peep shows in New York.  She's a stripper.  She has a cable access show where she just gets naked.  She's been on our show a lot because she claims she has this hemorrhoid that she shows us every time she comes in here.  But now we're starting to think that it's genital warts.  Genital warts. 
[01:51:30]  And then she's got that big thing on the front.  This big, looks like a big ear or something.  A big cauliflower ear growing out of her area down there.  And we're just horrified.  We hit twatto after a quatto from Total Recall.  Remember the little thing that grew out of that guy's stomach?  I must find the quatto.  Now it's called twatto on Sandy Kane.  And she won't have it looked at? 
[01:52:00]  No.  No.  And we put the pictures up on the website.  Are those pictures?  Somebody put this retard out of his misery.  Have you seen the picture yet?  No.  Like Ann said, it's like a little ear.  No.  Remember those lab mice?  They were on TV and stuff where they had the ears growing out of their bodies.  They had a growing ear.  They were growing ears on Mises' body there.  That's what it looked like.  Like a small ear.  Am I right?  Very close to the actual peach area.  Am I right?  And I don't know if it's still up on our website. 
[01:52:30]  Thank you.  They should have kept that up there for the new cities.  But anyway, all the people that checked out the picture, a lot of doctors and stuff called  our show and said, you know, she should have it looked at because that is a genital wart.  Look at this thing.  I can't look at it anymore.  All right.  If you go to WNEW.com, go to the Opie and Anthony section and look for Sandy Kane's growth.  Sandy Kane's growth.  It's a tumor.  No, that's a genital wart, my friend. 
[01:53:00]  Look at that.  That's a genital wart.  She said it's from shaving.  Yeah, she says it's from shaving.  Where is that at?  It goes a little further down.  The lens didn't capture all of it.  But you can check it out for yourself at WNEW.com.  So she's been in here a lot to horrify us.  There's more pictures of her up there, by the way, so you can see what a freaking age is.  So you can see what she looks like.  You've got to see her in her Wonder Woman outfit.  Oh, my Lord. 
[01:53:30]  And she still works the peep shows.  Who's paying for that?  I don't know.  Oh, man.  You get quarters back?  Look at that.  All right.  So Brother Joe came up with a song about Sandy Kane.  And it's not to the Patty Duke theme.  No.  Go figure that out.  Here's the Sandy Kane song.  I might add that there's Sandy Kane noises in the song as well.  Yes.  The noises you're about to hear are Sandy Kane herself.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, ah.  Known as Sandy Kane.  When she strips.  Yeah.  She falls a stomach pain.  She is covered.  Oh, ah.  With varicose veins.  And she has money rewards.  I don't see it.  Well, you'll hurl.  Oh.  When her pants come down.  There's a patch.  Oh.  It's crusty red and brown.  And it's smooth.  Oh. 
[01:54:30]  Like Bozo the Clown.  Yes, she loves her hammer.  You're disgusting.  Hey, Sandy.  You make eyes.  You make eyes.  When they look at your BD.  You make eyes.  You're just a wrinkled old lady with no teeth.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Sandy has vibrating tones.  And babbles in co-parent noise.  She chases.  Oh. 
[01:55:00]  Away all the boys and the girls.  And cats and dogs.  I don't play it.  One day.  Some retarded run.  He went down south.  But then he stung.  Oh.  Started kissing Sandy's bun.  Oh.  And Twido bit his nose.  You nauseating.  Hey, Sandy.  You make eyes.  You make eyes.  When they look at your BD.  You make eyes.  You ugly sound the old hoes bag. 
[01:55:30]  You're a free.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Yes, Sandy used to strip in bars till they told her to stop at 90.  She would take off all her friggin' clothes.  The customer's gone blind, yeah.  But she had always made a few extra birds with a mountain hand.  Oh.  Oh.  Sandy and her rancid bearded clam. 
[01:56:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  There you are.  Brother Joe Sandy Cain.  Rancid bearded clam.  When you can put that in a song, it's a winner.  It's a winner, all right.  Ken, what's going on?  Yeah, hey.  Hey, how are you guys doing?  All right, Ken.  I'm a new listener from Cleveland.  Okay.  And I know you guys are getting a lot of flack up here from some of the listeners and stuff.  I think you guys rock.  You guys are cool.  No.  I've never heard of you before, but I like what I hear. 
[01:56:30]  It's still early for Cleveland, but thank you.  We appreciate it, Ken.  No problem.  All right, man.  Keep it up.  Thanks.  It's the way it goes.  It just goes this way.  We go into new markets, and it takes time.  People aren't going to like it right off the bat.  I must say, though, I'm serious.  We've had a lot of early support in Cleveland.  Hell, yeah.  Anthony, we've got a letter.  I want to read this.  You might be better at this one, though.  Why?  What is it?  From the Village Voice?  Great.  Why would I be better?  Hey, how's that for a popper? 
[01:57:00]  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Remember the one that Stinky was reading?  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Here.  Let's see that.  This is from Savage Love.  Savage Love's column in the Village Voice.  It's sort of a question-and-answer thing, a la Ann Landers, only for the more sexually explicit problems.  I recently started dating a girl who has a strange fetish.  The first time we slept together, she wanted to wear a Catholic school uniform. 
[01:57:30]  What's wrong with that?  The schoolgirl fantasy turned me on, although I thought it was a bit odd to go that far our first time together.  Now she's taking things even further, to places I find disturbing.  The latest thing she does is nick the inside of that area on her with a razor blade so it bleeds a bit during the act. 
[01:58:00]  She says the pain it causes and the bleeding make it easier for her to fantasize that she's losing her virginity all over again.  This obviously seems like a high-risk sex to me.  And frankly, I'm starting to get a little nervous about how far she's going to want to go with this.  Is this a common fetish?  Should I be worried about this woman?  I wear a condom, but is there anything more I can do to protect myself?  Worried about blood. 
[01:58:30]  Holy God.  I've never heard of that fetish before.  Neither have I.  Knicking the, you nick it, you're like, nick it with a razor blade so she feels the pain and there's bleeding involved.  I can see why he's having sex, him cutting her, you know, or stabbing her, but I can't see.  With that, yeah, right, her doing it herself.  Right there, too.  I would think after a while, you don't want it to build up and look like the top of Rocky's eye.  You know, because it builds up like scarring. 
[01:59:00]  And it might not feel that good.  Dan writes, have you thought about a restraining order?  While I personally wouldn't be able to doze off after sex next to a woman who took a razor to her own urn before sex,  what worries me about this woman is not the innocent schoolgirl loses her virginity routine,  nor the lengths to which she's willing to go for the sake of her blood fetish.  It's wonderful that she's so in touch with her own needs and so open about what turns her on.  No, what worries me is that she didn't think you needed any prep before she sprang this freaked out S on you. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, really.  Edgy fantasies and fetishes are swell.  A lot of people have them, but reasonable, rationale, sane, together perverts don't just spring their kinks on new and unsuspecting partners.  When dating civilians, responsible fetishists have little talks,  they lay the groundwork and do some hand-holding before they haul out the Catholic schoolgirl outfits and the razors. 
[02:00:00]  Very good.  It's a turn-on, I guess, for her.  But as far as the danger goes,  yeesh, a little bloody, you know?  And if you're wearing a condom, I don't know,  if you get something above that,  because it seems to me like that would bleed a lot.  That's a heavy bleeding area, I think.  And if you have anything at the base of your junk,  an open wound or something,  God knows whatever you'd be into to get that,  but it could mix it together. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  Now you're in trouble.  Ah, Jeannie.  Jeannie, what's up?  Hello?  Yeah, what's up, Jeannie?  Hi, am I on the radio?  Yeah, you're on the radio.  This is a first for me.  Oh, no.  This is going to suck.  What's up, Jeannie?  Well, I was just kind of curious  what you meant when you said  that the voting for the Moms contest  is very interesting.  Oh, you're the Jeannie from the Moms I'd Like to Have contest.  I sure am.  Contestant number eight, the blonde, that's right.  Let me pop that up.  That's Jeannie, the blonde. 
[02:01:00]  Jeannie, you're definitely in the running,  I can tell you that much.  How does that look?  What does interesting mean?  We can't...  It sounds so ominous.  Well, we're just kind of keeping it neutral.  Okay.  A lot of people are voting for their favorite mom  in the Moms I'd Like to Have contest.  You've got to go to WNEW.com.  We've got ten contestants.  You're one of them.  And the voting is interesting.  Rich Voss is in the studio,  and he's saying that you're really hot.  Are you married?  Yes, I am.  It's called the Moms I'd Like to Have contest.  Well, it could be divorced.  Oh, yeah, there's a few that are divorced.  She's high. 
[02:01:30]  You're right.  How many kids do you have?  Two.  Yeah, her kids were running around  as three other moms.  Oh, that's right.  The Moms I'd Like to Have contest  were on the lesbian couch  going at it completely.  And the kids are here?  Yeah, running down the hall  playing with a little ball.  Good.  You want Gafish to hear about that.  They're young enough  not to know what's going on.  Jeannie, after the weekend,  when we get back on the radio on Monday,  we're going to narrow it down  to like five, so.  Okay.  And the voting is very interesting.  Very interesting.  Yeah, see, I don't like it 
[02:02:00]  when you say that.  Well, we can't, you know,  we've got to keep it neutral.  Jeannie, I think that voice of yours  is taking votes away as we speak.  Yeah, I would hang up.  Okay.  Yeah, all right.  You know, that could turn things around  right there.  People just go,  oh, God, the voice.  Right.  It's kind of high-pitched  and scratch cat-like.  Anthony, we got chicken with Earl?  Oh, thank God.  He's doing a WOW sticker stop today.  Where is he?  He's outside Yankee Stadium.  There's a lot of people going, 
[02:02:30]  well, we don't really care  in the city I'm listening in.  Right.  But trust me, you will care  because it's Earl.  Not Earl.  Let's see what Earl is up to.  Earl!  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  What's going on, Earl?  We're right outside gate two  at Yankee Stadium  for the start of the subway series  and we're going to be  handing out WOW stickers  pretty much right up until game time  and that's pretty much the deal.  He hung on. 
[02:03:00]  He gets so pissed off.  He gets so pissed off.  He gets pissed off  every single day.  Can you get Earl back on the phone?  I really needed to ask him something.  Ben is calling him back  but he doesn't answer his own cell phone.  Yeah, now he won't answer  because he's pissed off.  Okay, I won't do the snoring.  All right.  We got some information.  That may be a new record with Earl.  That was...  Is he picking up Ben?  He wants.  So he's got the phone on.  We'll see if he answers.  All right.  All right. 
[02:03:30]  Mm-hmm.  Come on, Earl.  Earl, he just picked it up  and hung up.  Oh, come on, Earl.  Wait, call him outside  because it's just going to waste time.  Just tell him we've got to  talk about the sticker stop  and a couple of things tomorrow  that involve him.  Yeah.  So make sure he gets on the phone.  I want to ask him about something.  Something very important  for tomorrow's road show.  Jesus.  Let's go to Ferris.  Ferris, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Congratulations on the new contract.  I hope you got some great medical. 
[02:04:00]  You guys have any idea  where you're going tomorrow?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's like in the middle of Beirut  for crying out loud.  Yeah, well, it's a little shaky down there.  It's disgusting.  Asbury Park,  they're trying to bring it back to life.  Right.  They're trying to revive it.  It's gross.  And who better than us  to bring it back?  Bring some plastic Asbury Park.  You've got to love it.  All right.  I've got to let you go  because Earl's back.  Thanks.  All right.  Here's Earl again.  Earl.  Earl, what's wrong?  Ben?  He claims he did not hang up. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, okay.  I did not hang up, guys.  Well, maybe it was a problem  with the phone.  All right.  So are you having fun out there?  Yeah.  Okay.  A lot of people coming up to you  to get the WOW stickers?  Yeah, we just pulled in  and we're going to have fun.  Okay.  Sounds it.  You're going to go  to the road show tomorrow?  I plan on it.  Well, we have a little problem,  don't we?  What's the problem?  You don't want to be  in the dunk tank.  I was asked and I said,  no, I don't want to be  in the dunking booth.  But Earl,  you know what the thing is?  Everyone would want 
[02:05:00]  to dunk you.  And it's for a good cause.  No, I just don't want to do it.  There's a charity  connected to this, Earl.  It's a dollar donation  to the Parent Project  Muscular Dystrophy Fund.  Yeah.  Earl, you would raise  a lot of money.  There's plenty of other  viable candidates,  but I just don't want  to participate.  Earl, you would make  the most money for a charity.  You'd rather see kids  that can't walk,  maybe not get a wheelchair  or something because  you decided you didn't  want to go in the dunk tank?  I can't think of anyone else  that our listeners  would like to dunk.  Right.  Why won't you go in the... 
[02:05:30]  What about Mindy?  You can put her  in the dunking tank.  There's not enough water.  Earl, why won't you  do the dunk tank?  I don't want to do it.  Why?  No, I just don't want  to do it.  You were telling Ben  you can't swim.  I can't do that either.  Oh, wow.  You can't...  Another one  busting the stereotypes apart.  But all you would have  to do is stand up  if there was a problem.  No, I just...  Earl...  I don't want to do it.  Earl, when are you  going to be a team player again?  I am a team player.  I just need to know. 
[02:06:00]  You won't let us  paint you white.  Then he'll be able  to swim.  Exactly.  That's not being  a team player.  There's some things  I'll do  and there's some things  I won't do.  This happens to be  one of the things  I don't want to do.  We kind of understood  your point when you said  you didn't want us  to paint you white.  Even though you're  called Black Earl  because you're always  in black,  we figured it'd be fun  to dress you in white  for a day.  Yeah, I don't even know  what the problem was there.  What was the problem  with that, Earl?  Everything.  Why?  No, seriously. 
[02:06:30]  What's the problem  with painting you  white for a day?  I don't even want  to go down that road.  Why?  I said I would be  painted black for a day.  Let's all change  our color for the day.  You'll be able  to get a bank loan.  Oh, God.  Break the bell.  Rich Voss.  He'll be at the  road show tomorrow  doing some of that humor.  Earl, seriously,  what was the problem  with being painted white?  No, I just highly  objected to that.  Educate me. 
[02:07:00]  No, you're talking  about adhering  or breaking  down stereotypes.  No way  was I going  to get painted white.  Really?  So then, all right,  we said, all right,  he doesn't want  to be painted white.  We'll paint him green  because he does  look a lot like Shrek  and you wouldn't  go for that one either.  No.  Jesus.  Hold on.  A couple people  want to talk to you.  Hold on.  Finley.  Yeah.  What's up?  No, I'm just  an advertising agent  for the Nytol company,  the sleeping pill company.  Oh, Nytol?  Yeah, and we'd like  to sponsor 
[02:07:30]  a black girl's calling.  A callback  from earlier  in the program.  We love callbacks.  Very good.  Let me see  what Joe wants.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Earl, can I just  say something  to you real quick?  Earl?  Yeah.  All right.  I'm very proud  of you for choosing  a game day  to go to the stadium.  It's very  breaking the  modern mold  for you.  Oh, like he would be  there when  the game wasn't  going on. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, that would be  the normal...  Or in December.  No, he wouldn't go  there when there's  nothing going on,  you effing tool.  Go eff yourself.  Hey, I'm very offended.  Earl, what do you say?  We just  paint each other up.  We'll do the...  We'll all paint  ourselves black.  You paint yourself  white.  It's like,  no, just thanks,  but no thanks, guys.  Earl, what about  the days when you  used to get into  little yellow Speedos  for us?  I didn't get into  a yellow Speedo.  It was powder blue.  Banana hammock.  It was a powder blue 
[02:08:30]  banana hammock?  It was the last thing  he ever did for this show.  Yeah, you...  And hung pictures.  You don't...  What?  Did I not go to  Mississippi for you guys?  Oh, you sat in a car.  That's easy.  You slept the whole way.  We did send a black man.  Oh, yeah.  And what's his name?  The freaking lunatic driver  walking around with a hooded  hood and sheet on?  We didn't know the driver  had brought his own  Klan outfit.  A shotgun?  And a shotgun.  We absolutely had no clue  that was going to happen.  You know what?  I'm starting to put  the pieces together. 
[02:09:00]  That's where you turned  and decided not to do  anything with us anymore.  I mean, not to do anything.  We sent a couple of our  guys down in Mississippi.  It's a long story,  but we sent Earl,  a black man,  to a...  It was a pretty racist town,  right, Earl,  to begin with?  No, actually,  it wasn't a racist...  It turned out  it wasn't a racist town,  but we just...  It was not the smartest  mission to go on.  Okay, so Earl's  at this farmhouse.  Oh, my God.  And, uh...  We were too...  Yeah, but you're out of...  We were at Susie's house.  Yeah, Susie's house.  You're in the driveway. 
[02:09:30]  You guys are kind of  hanging out,  and the neighbor  is very suspicious  because Susie doesn't  have a lot of guests.  Very small town.  Very small town,  and they watch out  for each other.  There's a black people there.  All right,  they watch out  for each other.  Earl is dressed  all in black  in Susie's driveway  with a couple other guys.  Next thing you know,  the driver,  who we really  didn't know that well.  Yeah.  Scott.  Scott, the driver,  walks out of the big urban,  the suburban he had,  or whatever,  in KKK garb. 
[02:10:00]  He had an entire  KKK uniform  and a shotgun.  And the neighbor  saw it and freaked out,  and luckily they called,  they called the station  instead of calling the cops.  Right.  Well, Susie.  Otherwise,  we would have all  been strung up.  Susie told us that,  you know,  that that guy was,  no,  that you, Earl,  were lucky  that you didn't get  shot at.  Yeah, exactly.  The guy in the house  got his own uniform on  and he wanted to join in.  Hey, finally a party.  But Earl,  that was the last thing 
[02:10:30]  you did for us.  How about the dunk tank tomorrow?  Just for a little while.  Gotta do the dunk tank.  I don't want to do  the dunk tank, guys.  Gotta do the dunk tank, Earl.  Earl, come on.  Know how much money  you would raise?  People are calling in  saying,  look, man,  I'll give $10, $20  to the charity  to get a chance  to dunk Earl.  It's much appreciated,  but no,  I don't want to do it.  It's not appreciated.  It's very early on to do  and I said from the get-go  I didn't want to do it.  Well, what's the problem  with the dunk tank?  I don't want to do  the dunk tank.  Why, though? 
[02:11:00]  Come on, Earl.  Just not in the mood  to do the dunk tank.  Let me see what Steve  has to say here.  Steve.  Hey, what's up, guys?  You're on with Earl.  Hey, Earl.  Hey, Earl,  I don't understand  what the problem is.  It's not like there's  going to be a noose  around your neck  or anything.  Oh, my God.  Hey, syndication  when the south rises  a guy should have looked  holy ass.  All right, here's the deal, Earl.  You do the dunk tape  or you watch Norris  for an hour.  Oh.  Okay.  Earl, I apologize for that.  I didn't hear what he said.  Earl, come on, man. 
[02:11:30]  You got to do  the dunk tank tomorrow.  No hips, hands, or butts.  I was asking very early  to do the dunk tank  and I said, no, I'm not.  Now we're telling.  We're not asking anymore.  It's for a charity.  Earl, it's for sick kids.  Well, there's plenty of other  people that can do it.  What if it was  for the Rainbow Coalition?  Would you go then?  No.  I wouldn't do it for anybody.  Come on, Earl.  How about for like  just 20 minutes? 
[02:12:00]  I was like, thanks, guys,  but no thanks.  It's not something  you say thanks  but no thanks to.  It's something you just say, okay.  No, I mean,  I'm honored that you asked me,  but I was like, you know what?  It's like, no, no thanks.  I'm not asking you  to speak on a dinner.  Earl, you don't do anything  for us anymore.  You do sticker stops.  You could sound like  an intern for that.  You're much more talented  than that.  I was like,  no, I'm just,  no thanks, guys. 
[02:12:30]  Are you afraid you'll drown?  No.  Because you can't swim.  All right, Earl,  if you let us down again,  we're not going to try  to convince you  for the next 20 minutes.  All right.  All right, have fun  at the WOW sticker stop.  Thank you, guys.  We're at gate two.  All right, great.  Thanks, Earl.  Thank you, guys.  Another great call  from Earl.  Thanks.  Wonderful.  Thanks, Earl.  Great, Earl.  Thanks, Earl.  All right, toll free,  877-692-1027.  In the studio,  Rich Voss,  he's going to be  at the road show tomorrow.

[02:16:00]  All owned by  Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW.  And we're back  with the Opie and Anthony show.  877-692-1027.  Rich Voss in the studio.  Michael, what's up?  Hey guys, how you doing?  All right, man.  Hey, Voss.  What's up?  You're whoring yourself  on the radio again?  You got your knee pads on?  Yeah, why?  What did I do now?  Who's this?  Not a question.  What do you mean?  Who's this?  Yeah, who's this? 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, one of these people  never go to your shows.  You suck.  I do?  Yeah.  Okay, who's this?  What are you waiting for?  Are you waiting to make fun of Earl?  Or more or less,  I hope Gorilla Boy calls up  and you make fun of him?  That's your whole deal?  Yeah, that's my whole life.  Yeah, okay.  And what's your life?  Sitting there listening  and worrying what I'm doing?  No.  Is this the same douchebag  that called last time  and said he was a cab driver?  No, actually,  someone different  who hates your guts again.  The population is growing.  Oh, no, there's two.  There's two people that hate me.  How much do you pay for lines, anyway?  I mean, you're the same old, 
[02:17:00]  same old, aren't you, huh?  I haven't done the same lines.  Did you get your teeth fixed yet?  Did you get your teeth fixed yet, pal?  How do you know what I look like?  What?  Obviously, you came to see me  if you know what I look like.  I took a look at your website,  you loser.  You're a real loser  if you went to my website.  You're obsessed with me.  I'm not obsessed with you,  you moron.  Obviously, you are.  Then why did you go to my website,  zero?  What are you talking about zero?  You're the zero.  It's in your bank account, pal.  I can own you.  You can own me?  Yeah, I can own you.  Okay, then I'm for sale.  How much?  You look at my website.  You're pathetic.  You're hoping Gorilla Boy  calls up to get some material, 
[02:17:30]  okay, pal?  I'm just sitting here.  I'm throwing in a line  every now and then.  Yeah, every now and then.  I don't even hear you.  You don't even answer the show.  You're sitting there  waiting to plug.  I'm waiting.  I'm counting the minutes  for you to plug, okay?  What do you plug?  What do you do?  You own my own company,  you moron.  Oh, you own your own company.  What do you paint houses  or do roofs?  Huh?  What do you do?  What do I do?  I own my own company.  Yeah, I own my own company.  And what's your company?  What's your kind of personality?  Wow.  What are you talking about?  You have no personality. 
[02:18:00]  I have no personality.  That's okay.  Not at all.  That's okay.  You're sitting here waiting  anticipating like a $5 whore  ready to pump anytime you can.  What do you want me to do?  You've got your knee pads on  and you're ready to pump  where you're going to be.  Now they're syndicated.  Now you're really going to be there  all the time  which is a living, breathing nightmare.  I have not said anywhere  I'm going to be, okay?  Yeah, okay.  You're going to be there  waiting to pump.  Oh, I'm going to be in Philadelphia  or I'm going to be here.  No, I'm not going to be in Philadelphia.  Oh, my God.  You're a loser.  I'm a loser.  Okay, that's why I've done 
[02:18:30]  You've got the same old spiel, okay?  What do you want me to do?  Earl calls up  and you've got to make fun of him, right?  I said one joke.  Did everybody else make fun of Earl?  Stupid.  No.  What's this?  It's not your place to make.  It's not your joke, you idiot.  When I'm invited here,  I do what I want, okay?  Yeah, you do what you want,  but you sit there  like a $3 oar  and you're ready to pump out  where I'm playing  and where I'm not playing.  That's what it comes down to.  I did not say where I was playing.  How much do you pay for material?  What do you think about it?  You know what?  Every comedy that comes in here plugs.  Have you heard me plug anything? 
[02:19:00]  Okay, zero?  All right.  Have I plugged anything?  Zero.  Get something new.  It's the same old deal with you.  What am I supposed to do?  Change my personality  every time I come here?  You don't love the fact  that Norton calls up  and he has the material  to talk about again.  Now, is it Norton or Norton?  Same thing over and over  and over again, okay?  And it's funny  every time we do it, okay?  And you always listen, stupid.  You're about a funny  Jerry Lewis in French.  Oh, yeah, that's real funny.  All right, is that it?  No, it's not it.  Do you want to come see me tonight  at the stress factory?  See, there you go. 
[02:19:30]  I'll be here tonight and tomorrow  if you want to come see me.  I'm so funny.  I knew it was coming, man.  How can people be that angry  at a person?  I don't get it.  Jeff Norris.  Hey, happy Fourth of July.  Thank you.  You know, it's amazing.  I can continue on with life  and Voss could be a jerk off  and the crawlers realize  that it's beautiful.  Oh, this is unbelievable.  You had that guy called,  didn't you?  Oh, yeah, I know him.  He's here helping me.  Put another nail on the roof there.  He's helping you. 
[02:20:00]  What's up, Norris?  How are you guys?  No, I just feel bad for Rich, man.  You know, I understand  his CDs aren't selling  and no dentist will see him  because he's disgusting.  It's a shame.  And now that you guys  are syndicated,  five other cities  are going to know Voss sucks.  Oh, that's right.  It's beautiful.  I don't have to do nothing.  I keep doing voiceovers,  a little show here and there  and meet some nice people  that listen.  You're doing Paula Poundstone  impressions now, I heard.  Oh, that's good, Rich.  You're going out with an  eight-year-old.  Rich, I understand you're  upset. 
[02:20:30]  Hey, look at...  You're upset because the  caller just told you off  and he shut you up  and he's just a caller.  He shut me up.  I kept talking.  One caller calls up, okay?  Oh, you were great, too.  I've been on here 20 times.  I've had two calls.  I know, Rich.  I know.  See, it's a shame  when you're a Jewish  hot comic that has  nothing in life to do  except take a cab  to 57 and 7  and go up there  and go,  look, open it.  My wife left me.  I have two kids  and I have nothing to do.  Can I come up there  and maybe 1-800-BRIGHTSMILE  will call  and give me a free consultation? 
[02:21:00]  Holy Christ.  And I can't wait  to see you tomorrow, Rich.  It's a stone pony  and then kill your skull  in front of thousands.  Why are you going to be there?  They don't need anybody  to work the door.  That's good.  What are you going to be there?  That's good.  Hey, is it true?  Seriously,  somebody told me  when you pull up  at a gig  that this is true  and this is serious.  When you pull up,  like you'll sit there  and put your hands  on the steering wheel  and take a deep breath  and go,  this is the audience  that's going to like me.  No, no.  Usually I just go, 
[02:21:30]  this show's going to rock  because the hacking Jew  ain't here.  Do you say,  Otto, I'll meet inside?  No, you see,  Otto won't work with you  because Otto's a great...  Oh, my.  They're cursing, man.  Why, wait, first of all,  I heard you're doing  some extra work now.  What's that?  Are you doing some extra work?  I heard you got a movie.  Yeah, but it's not extra.  It's a principal role.  It's a principal role?  Yeah.  Yeah, please.  Maybe you heard of  Monica Potter.  No.  No.  No?  That's all right.  You do her impression? 
[02:22:00]  Who's Monica Potter?  Of course, let me ask you this, Rich.  Ask me whatever you want, Buttercup.  Okay, jerk off.  How long have you been in the business?  All right.  I mean, the only thing you got out of comedy  is your wife left you.  That's it.  That's the only thing you got.  You got two daughters  and your wife walked out of there.  I got two beautiful kids, okay?  And don't bring them up.  I just booked seven TV shows, stupid.  Wow.  I mean, seven.  What?  Animal Planet?  Animal Planet?  Yeah, for the fever?  Is that what you're doing, Rich?  No, Animal Planet on TV, you jerk off. 
[02:22:30]  I'm doing Animal Planet, okay?  I heard you're up for an Oscar  for your cereal bit, okay?  You know what?  I am.  That's why they extended the contract,  but I got four more to do for Mini Week.  You got four more Mini Week?  Yeah, how about it?  Wow, the girls are going to flock around you now.  That's right.  Just to fill the audience in,  and yeah, Jeff is the voice of the Mini Week  when they're both standing  on the side of the road hitchhiking.  Give one of the lines there, right, Jeff?  Come on, Jeff.  No, I like the sound.  Yeah, I listen to it. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, I believe that, too.  Don't drag me into this, man.  You know I'm a friend of yours.  Man, I know you're a friend,  but I know how you and Oak  love this first battle with me and Voss.  This is not a battle.  There's five kids in Houston  with a brighter future than you.  Really?  Oh, fuck.  Hey, let me ask you something.  Voss, how old are you?  What?  How old are you, Voss?  Wow.  How old am I?  Yeah.  What does that mean, how old am I?  Just answer the question, stupid.  How old am I?  Don't ever call me stupid.  How old am I?  I'm 32.  Yeah, you're 32, and I'm 18. 
[02:23:30]  You ain't 32.  No, I didn't say how many minutes  you have in your act.  Okay, I'm 44.  Why?  You're 44.  How long have you been in the business?  18 years, and I'm doing very well.  And what have you gotten out of it?  Do you want to look at my resume  or your resume?  You can fit your resume  on a business card, okay?  Your resume stinks.  Your resume starts off with pips, okay?  Really?  See, here he goes again, mocking pips.  I like that.  Then you just call Ray Garvey and say,  Ray, it's a radio bid.  Don't beat me up,  because Ray Garvey wants to kill you.  I know he wants to kill me.  Hey, let me tell you something. 
[02:24:00]  Last time I was on with my daughters.  All right, he comes in there.  Listen, let me.  What's the S word?  Put a muzzle on the hacking Jew,  and let me talk.  All right, go ahead, talk.  He calls me up after every time  he comes on the radio,  and he goes,  you ain't mad at me, are you?  I sure wouldn't want a guy  like you mad at me.  You're right,  because you'll be tardy strong.  And then Ray Garvey calls him.  Ray Garvey goes,  why are you mocking on my club pips?  If I remember correctly, boss.  And this is exactly what I said.  I said I wasn't mocking on pips.  When Seth used to own pips,  you would knock on his door begging you. 
[02:24:30]  Never, never, never.  To perform.  Never.  They wouldn't even let you  watch dishes there.  Listen to me, stupid.  I've canceled more gigs this month  than you've gotten, okay?  You think so?  I haven't worked pips.  Well, then you must have canceled  about 18 gigs.  Oh, you stink.  Shut up and listen to me, okay?  Yeah.  You roadhouse.  I'm going to enjoy watching you  bleed tomorrow.  I'm having a vaudeville flashback  listening to you, okay?  You'll stink.  Okay.  I'm going to tell you something.  Go ahead.  I'm not trashing pips.  I haven't worked there in years.  I like that.  Yeah, I wonder why.  Oh, oh, because I can't afford to work for a... 
[02:25:00]  Well, forget it.  I don't want to trash his club.  It has nothing to do with his club.  Hey, you don't have to worry about me.  Garvey's going after you, not me.  Oh, because I said something negative  about his club.  He's going to come after me?  Oh, can I tell you?  Oh, oh.  I love him.  And the comics start going after each other.  No, don't say comics.  No, don't say comics.  Anthony, Anthony.  Say comic and open it.  I haven't gone after Voss yet,  but it's coming.  Yeah, and I will.  But it's coming.  I almost said I'll hurt you,  but you are retarded strong.  You're going to hurt me?  No, I didn't say that. 
[02:25:30]  All right.  How?  All right, all right.  No, he's starting to bother me.  All right, get off the stage  because nobody likes you.  You suck and you're a disgusting Jew.  Nobody likes you.  Wow.  I'll see you tomorrow  and I can't wait for a while you bleed.  You're coming tomorrow?  Yeah.  Are you going on stage?  I'm only going tomorrow  to rip your throat off.  All right.  So I'm very pleased if you're listening,  be there tomorrow  because you're going to have  a dead buck-toothed Jew on stage  with a Kango hat.  All right, Jeff.  Nice talking to you guys.  We're working this weekend, Jeff.  Voss, if you keep talking, 
[02:26:00]  I'm going to find you in Flamesfield.  I'll give you my address, okay?  I can find it easy.  It's the one that says  a cardboard Kenmore box, right?  That's real funny.  I need yard work.  What are you doing Sunday?  All right.  Listen, listen, listen.  We've got to go.  You're dead, Jew.  All right.  There we go.  Wow.  Jeff Norris,  girl or boy.  I think you had that other guy  call up first.  Girl?  Stocker Patty, what's up?  Hi, how are you?  Good.  I volunteer to go into the dunk tank  to make girls feel better  about not being alone. 
[02:26:30]  Are you going to bring  your own soap?  I bet I could just place  a couple ounces of water  with my skinny body.  I'm going into the wet t-shirt contest  anyway, so I'll be wet.  No, Patty, you will not be  in the wet t-shirt contest tomorrow.  Oh, my God.  She wants to do the wet t-shirt contest.  Patty, you don't have a chance  in hell of winning  the wet t-shirt contest.  Why would you do that  to yourself?  Well, it doesn't hurt to try.  It's the new free-spirited Patty.  Patty, have you had dreams  that maybe you walk away  the winner and walk away 
[02:27:00]  with all that money?  How much money?  $1,000 for the first place tomorrow.  $1,000 first prize, Patty.  Have you been dreaming about,  oh, my God,  if I had $1,000 I could eat.  Oh, no.  Have a roof over my head.  If I won like that,  it would only go for one thing  to the new place  that I'm moving to  in Staten Island.  Patty, where have you been staying?  Well, I was in a hotel.  Now I'm staying  with a couple of friends  and then I'm going  to be moving on Tuesday.  You call it a hotel,  but what was it really?  Be honest.  It was a hotel.  It was the one  on Jane Street. 
[02:27:30]  It's not a hotel.  It's not a hotel  when the whole floor  has to share a bathroom.  Yep.  You had to share a bathroom  with everybody, right?  Yes, I did.  And tell everybody  what happened  when you took a shower one day.  What do you mean?  I didn't tell anybody.  Oh, I heard this story.  You went in,  took a shower,  and what happened?  Something very strange  happened that I'm still  trying to figure out.  I hung up a pair  of my underwear,  and then I went  to go change  into my night clothes,  and they were missing,  and I can't figure out  what happened. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, my gosh.  Someone stole your underwear?  Someone stole Patty's panties.  No!  That was a nice scream.  Yeah.  But anyway,  I don't want to get  to be a sport  and go into the duck tank.  You're not going  into our duck tank.  You're not going  to be in the wet  t-shirt contest.  Someone stole your panties  at the YWCA, 
[02:28:30]  whatever they call it?  Well, I guess  that's what happened.  I didn't hear anybody  while I was taking  a shower,  so it could have happened.  You sure they didn't  walk away?  Ah!  Wow.  That's what I was  trying to imitate,  by the way.  I almost had it.  Well, anyway,  I just wanted  to be a sport.  Really?  You know.  Stalker Patty?  Yes.  Why are you  on my subway train now? 
[02:29:00]  What do you mean?  What?  Why are you  on my subway train?  Why that?  What do you mean?  I was going...  What do you mean  on your subway train?  It's not your train.  I just happened  to be waiting  for the train  and you happened  to come down the step.  Four days in a row?  Or four days  in the last, like,  week and a half?  Oh, my God.  She's totally tracking you.  Four days in the last  week and a half?  I've been walking.  It wasn't bad enough  you hang outside  the building  or upstairs in the lobby.  Now you're  on my subway train.  I've been walking  back to the hotel  lately. 
[02:29:30]  I haven't even  taken a train home.  Where have you  seen me?  Were you on  the subway train  last week?  Last Friday?  Yeah, I was just  going...  Yeah, I left.  I left the  truth.com  whatever early  and I went  down the steps.  Weren't you  boring me to death  with your bowling stories?  Oh, stop it.  Oh, no.  I go bowling.  Oh, he's too much.  I like it  because I've run out  because I can't  afford shoes.  And they're pretty  cheap. 
[02:30:00]  You pay for a game,  you get colorful  shoes to wear  with numbers  on the back.  Hey, we're trying  to find your  missing panties,  by the way.  Oh, I forgot  about them already.  I just didn't  use that sour...  Hello, ma'am,  ma'am,  soccer patty.  Hello, Lieutenant  Columbo here.  I'm looking  for your panties.  Is it true  they had a stent  like trout?  No.  Because that'll  make it easier  to find.  No.  Perhaps they were... 
[02:30:30]  Is it also true  that the perpetrator  had to pull them  off the doorknob  because they were  stuck there like glue?  No.  You had some kind  of glue substance  on your panties,  ma'am?  No.  Could that possibly be...  Is it true that  it could have been  mistaken for a  shoeshine rag?  No.  Because you'd eaten  some Mexican food,  ma'am?  Oh, no.  I can't believe it.  Perhaps...  Did you see  Martin Landau  or William Shatner  in your bathroom  right before it happened  because they 
[02:31:00]  perpetrated a lot  of crimes  back in the 70s  on Columbo?  No.  No.  Were they edible panties?  No, they weren't.  Was a big, fat, drunk  spanking one out  to you in the shower  before they disappeared?  Oh, no.  Just imagine  what goes on  in those shelters  like that.  Patty's taking a shower  and you know  every, like,  disgusting guy  was just, like,  cranking a batch out.  Did you report  the missing panties  to anyone?  No, I just said,  oh, well,  it's just one of those  weird things,  just forget about it. 
[02:31:30]  I just didn't use  that shower again  and I didn't have  another problem.  Some guy back  in his dingy room  with the red neon sign  outside blinking  just rubbing Patty's panties  all over his face.  Oh, stop it.  That's so yucky.  Yeah, it sure is, Patty.  I just have to...  Stop it.  We all agree.  I just got to imagine  it was the Edge  that stole him from you  too.  It was my favorite.  I picture the Edge  just wiping himself  in my panties.  No.  No?  No, I don't have  that kind of a mind. 
[02:32:00]  Someone's doing  disgusting things  at your panties, Patty.  Hold on, disgusting.  I've been to other  people before.  Lottie.  Lottie, yeah.  Lottie, what's up?  Not much.  Yeah, so Patty,  she's interesting.  She's a real stalker  of the radio program.  Well, that's just great.  No, I mean...  And she lives  in a shelter  and someone stole her...  No, I don't live  there anymore now.  It wasn't a shelter.  It was the Riverview Hotel  on Jane Street.  No, that just sounds classy. 
[02:32:30]  And someone stole her panties  while she was showering.  I just didn't...  I had to be a real  desperate guy  because she has  the body of a turnip.  I just didn't go  to that virgin.  Is she really  that nasty?  What?  She's a 40...  Is she that nasty?  Lottie, she's  a 46-year-old virgin.  Oh, my God.  I'm 15  and I'm not even  a virgin.  Nice!  Well, I haven't  done some other  things in my life  that I have  to worry about.  Lottie, anyone  ever steal your panties?  No, not really. 
[02:33:00]  Well, I don't live  in Cleveland  because could you  just mail them to me?  Yeah, sure.  Anytime.  Along with your  bicycle seat?  Anything.  Your kitchen chair  you sit in?  Whatever.  I don't care.  Yeah, Lottie's  calling from Cleveland.  Gym shorts.  Yeah, Lottie,  she's the real deal.  Stalker Patty.  Oh, that's great.  So, she wanted  to be in the  dunking booth  thing you guys  are having,  I guess up in New York?  In the wet t-shirt contest.  In the wet t-shirt contest.  Hold on one second,  Lottie,  because speaking 
[02:33:30]  of the wet t-shirt contest,  Jason has a good idea.  Jason.  Hey, what's up,  Boba?  Hey.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, you can't let  Stalker Patty  in the wet t-shirt contest,  man.  If she won,  can you just see it?  She's up there,  she gets the crown  and the tiara,  and all of a sudden  the bucket of pig's blood  comes down on her.  The door to the stone pony  comes slamming shut  and the fire hoses  starts spraying all over.  Don't laugh at you.  All right.  You know what?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Patty?  Yeah?  We do have some extra money  and I know how bad 
[02:34:00]  you need money.  Would you allow us  to pour pig blood  over your head  in front of 4,000 people  tomorrow?  No.  Oh, I couldn't get  it out of my hair.  Then you go in the  dunking booth  or the lesbian pool  to clean off.  Please, Patty.  Look at all your  underwear you can buy.  You'll be the hit  of our road show tomorrow.  You're up in front  of 3,000 to 4,000 people  and we take  any red substance  and just dump it  in a bucket.  Here, piggy, piggy.  Well, will it be  easy to wash off  for it to clean? 
[02:34:30]  We'll get some kind  of red stuff, right?  Yeah, that's easy  to wash off, guys,  because I know  a bunch of people  will now get  a bucket of something.  We've got to get  some kind of a prom dress  for Patty to put on,  a tiara and flowers,  and pull a total  carry on her.  Yes.  As someone who is  going to the road  all this stuff for us  and we will give you  some fine prizes.  That was funny.  We could use  Norris' blood  when I'm through with him.  Oh, right.  All right.  Yeah.  Thanks, Jason,  for the idea, man.  Hey, thanks a lot.  See you guys tomorrow. 
[02:35:00]  I would do the junk tank,  but I only weigh  five pounds.  Even if they hit  the target,  I don't have enough  weight to level  the seat.  Stalker Patty,  you'll do that, right?  Well, okay,  as long as I can  clean off right after.  I don't like getting dirty.  You had Ron Jeremy's  hand on your pants.  What do you mean?  You probably got  venereal disease.  Hey, Lottie.  Yeah.  All right,  you're back on  with Stalker Patty.  Lottie,  you want to give  Stalker Patty,  the 46-year-old virgin,  any advice?  Yeah,  just keep all your 
[02:35:30]  clothes on,  and I don't know  what big bastard  decided to steal  your underwear,  but just don't hunt  them down, okay,  because it's bad enough  that you just  took the underwear,  but I mean,  you in person  coming at them,  that's just,  I like it.  Yeah, Lottie's got  a little potty mouth.  I don't even know  who did it.  Potty Lottie.  Potty Lottie.  Hey, Lottie,  tell all your friends  we're in Cleveland  now, okay?  All right,  Sarah,  I love you guys.  You guys are just hot.  That's good.  Lottie,  it's like drugs  in your school.  You got to,  you know,  get one kid hooked, 
[02:36:00]  and then we tell them  to pass it on  to all their friends.  Oh,  I pass it on  to all my friends.  I've been telling them  you guys have sexy voices,  and you're just hot.  Oh, my God.  How old are you guys?  I'm 15 also.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, then, you know,  we should hook up  and never get up.  Absolutely.  Lottie,  I'm 18.  Oh, really?  Like the older guys.  18.  No, that's nothing.  18's nothing.  Oh, my God.  What, 
[02:36:30]  you been with older guys  there, Lottie?  Yes,  a couple.  How old's the oldest  guy you've been with?  I'm 27.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yeah, little Lira.  Does Mommy,  does Mommy know about this?  No, Mommy does not  know about this.  Does Daddy know about this?  No.  And who writes you  the note?  Huh?  Forget it.  All right, Lottie,  we're going to let you go.  Okay.  All right,  keep listening, all right?  All right,  love you guys.  All right.  Bye.  Patty,  we'll hopefully  not see you tomorrow.  Oh, I'll be there. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, right.  We're going to do  the pig blood,  though, all right?  I'm going to bring  a couple changes  of clothes.  Hey, would you lip sync  to a Rush song  up on stage?  A what song?  A Rush song.  I don't know one.  Well, you look like  Getty Lee,  so I figured,  you know,  just picture Getty Lee.  She looks like  Getty Lee  if Getty Lee  was ravaged  by heroin.  Oh, I'm not  that bad looking.  No.  No.  All right, Patty.  All right,  I'll see you tomorrow. 
[02:37:30]  Not tonight  on the subway, right?  No.  All right, good.  Thanks, Patty.  Okay.  Later.  Bye-bye.  You're the men  who hold our places  must be the ones  to start  molding new reality  closer to the heart  I'll play.  And as we take a break,  we're going to take a,  we're going to listen  to another track  from May I Help You,  Dumbass.  Yeah.  You want to explain this  in case we have  a brand new audience  check it in?  It's a Matt  from the Upright Citizens Brigade.  Right.  He has a phone number 
[02:38:00]  that's really similar  to a tech support  for computers  and he was getting  phone calls  at all hours  for quite a while  and then he decided  to just tape them  and give people  wrong advice  and be obnoxious to them  and put out a CD.  Pretty funny.  This is a really good one.  When we get back,  we'll play  What Did We Learn  on the O.P. and Anthony  Show today?  It's called your FC number.  It's an access code number  so no one else  and get the code.  Why not?  Well, your FC  is your favorite color.  What's your favorite color?  Blue. 
[02:38:30]  So that's B-L-U.  Write that down.  Let me get all this.  This is on B-L-U, right?  Right.  Okay.  A equals 1,  B equals 2,  C equals 3,  so on through the alphabet.  Adjoin those numbers.  Now, I'm accessing  your computer right now.  Right.  Hold on.  I'm hacking into your computer.  Okay.  Okay.  I see the problem.  All right. 
[02:39:00]  You've tried to get on the computer  and you've failed, right?  Uh, no.  I, I put in my, uh,  Costco's ROM  and I put the username  and password  and then that popped up  when I went on to...  Right, sir.  Well, I'm, I've hacked  into your computer  and apparently you've been  downloading porn  into your computer  and we can't work with people  who download porn  into their computer.  What did I download?  Porn, pornography?  No.  No, I'm not.  Yeah, sir.  Sir, I'm in your computer  right now  and you have downloaded porn.

It's a brand new computer.  I just opened it up today  and set it up.  Well, you must have  a teenager or something.  Nope.  I'm by myself  and there's no pornography here.  Sir, I'm looking at it right now.  You've downloaded  a lesbian program.  Nope.  Negative.  Sir, I'm looking at it.  I'm not lying to you.  You have the right number.  What number are you,  are you dialed into?  Your number is two...  Right.  That's my number  in New York City here, Manhattan. 
[02:40:00]  And I have no porno.  Your last name is...  And I have no porno  on this computer.  Well, then you need to contact  your computer company  because there's been porn  downloaded on your computer.  That's all I'm telling you.  All right.  I'm going to call up  E-Machine then.

Tell me  about  this.  All right,  here's the  line of the  day.  Oh, boy.  This is  going to be  really painful.  It's  self-explanatory.  If you  want to get  laid,  you don't  want diseases,  use a condom.  There you  go. 
[02:43:30]  There you  go.  What else  do I need  to know?  Yeah,  Ann doesn't  like them,  though.  They're  removing.  Oh,  yeah,  Ann doesn't  like them,  though.  Wait,  I got to  hear that  again.  Wonderful.  I was all  worked up.  I was ranting  and raving.  Everyone in  New York  understands,  but other  cities,  they're not  going to  understand.  She asks,  do you  use a  condom?  Yeah,  Ann doesn't  like them,  though.  Because I  was so  hyper.  You didn't  even catch  that I said 
[02:44:00]  that.  Of course  not.  But we've  discussed  condoms on  the show.  I use  condoms,  and you  have said  that you  don't like  using  condoms.  Don't use  those things.  But it  came out  like this.  It's  self-explanatory.  If you  want to  get laid,  you don't  want diseases,  use a  condom.  There you  go.  There you  go.  What else  do I  need to  know?  Yeah,  Ann doesn't  like them,  though.  Oh,  God damn.  Oh,  man,  is that,  that could be  the worst.  Dude,  come on.  That could be  the worst  line.  Lung me out  to dry.  I'm not even  pitching in that 
[02:44:30]  scenario.  That could be  the worst  line ever,  ever uttered  on our  show.  Oh,  that's  just awful.  Jesus.  Yeah,  good one.  Great,  great.  I'm the  catcher in  that scenario.  Wonderful.  And I  don't like  them.  I'm even  worse.  I'm like a  homo slut.  What do  you say?  There's  nothing to  say. 
[02:45:00]  Steve,  what's up?  What's  up?  Hey,  man.  What's  going on?  You tell  us.  Let's  go.  All  right.  Well,  I was  just curious.  Do you  guys watch  South Park  a lot?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All  right.  That sandy  girl,  that sandy  lady,  that really,  really nasty  stripper that  you guys had  on there.  The one  episode where  the nurse had  that dead  fetus growing  out of the  side of her  head.  That doesn't  look like an  ear.  What she  has there,  that's like  that dead  fetus syndrome  going on.  That's just  nasty.  If you look  real close at  that website, 
[02:45:30]  you can see  two eyes,  little mouth  growing on  there.  All right,  man.  Who looked  that close?  I couldn't  even.  I looked  that close  because that  was nasty.  All right,  Steve.  That was  definitely  nasty.  You guys  kick ass.  Thank you.  Bye.  Let's go to  Deb the Dyke.  Hey,  Deb the Dyke,  what's up?  Hey,  guys.  Hey,  I learned  that you  guys are  going to  Skagberg Park  because there's  nothing there  but the  pony and  gags.  Oh,  great.  And the  guy that  stole  Stalker  Patty's  underwear?  Yeah.  Used him  to make  soup.  You know,  sometimes  people in  shelters  got to  get their  food where 
[02:46:00]  they can.  You know  how I  make soup?  How?  Stick my  face in  a sink  full of  hot water.  Well,  she's a  dyke.  Gotcha.  Deb the  Dyke.  Who could  tell with  that sexy  voice,  though,  that you're  a lesbian?  But she  doesn't have  the dyke  haircut,  Anthony.  But you  have the  gay voice.  Yeah,  you do.  You have  kind of a  manly  voice.  Well,  like if you  were a  14-year-old  boy just  starting  puberty  type voice.  Well,  you know,  nothing I  can do  about that.  I've got to  get in  touch with  Gay  Marco.  No,  no,  no.  Listen to  that. 
[02:46:30]  No,  it's even  better.  And last  time she  called,  we made  this  reference.  Talk  again,  Deb.  Next  time  Gay  Marco  calls,  I've got  to get  in  touch  with  him.  He  always  calls  too  early.  I'm  on  the  road  when  he  calls.  Tell me  this isn't  Butters,  a couple  years  older.  Next  time I  gotta  talk to  Gay  Marco.  Hey,  you guys  are having  a lesbian  pool  tomorrow?  Yeah,  we'll have  a lesbian  pool at  the road  show  tomorrow.  Yes.  Oh,  cool.  I'll be  there  tomorrow.  All right,  cool.  All right,  see you  guys  tomorrow.  Bye.  Bye.  The other  city's  going to  feel left  out, 
[02:47:00]  but we're  going to  have  so  much  video  and  pictures  that  you'll  feel  like  you're  there  when  you're  checking  out.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  I learned  that the  joke's  on Opie  because  Anthony's  not gay.  Joke's  on you.  Thank you.  Hey,  we'll see you  guys tomorrow  down here  in my  backyard,  right?  Right on,  we're going  to have  fun tomorrow.  All right,  bye.  All right,  bye.  It's  self-explanatory.  If you  want to  get laid,  you don't  want  diseases,  use a  condom.  There you  go.  There you  go. 
[02:47:30]  What else  do I need  to know?  Yeah,  Ant doesn't  like him  though.  All right,  enough.  You didn't  even hesitate  I use  them.  Anthony,  on the  other hand,  when he's  having sex  with women,  he prefers  not to  use the  condoms.  Me,  I like  using the  condoms  when I'm  with women.  Women.  But Anthony  with women  doesn't like 
[02:48:00]  having the  condoms  on his  junk.  Oh,  my God.  Steve writes,  I learned on  the show  today that  whippedcreambikini.com  plugs were  at 308  310,  312,  and 524.
