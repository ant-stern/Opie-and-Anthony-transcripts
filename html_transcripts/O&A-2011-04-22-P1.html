<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with speculation about Ted Williams’ post-fame life, concluding he likely returned to homelessness.  This segued into a discussion of Rebecca Black's "Friday" and its astronomical view count, comparing it to other viral videos like "Charlie Bit My Finger."  A caller, Bobo, then provided a chaotic one-man band performance using household items, much to the hosts' amusement and slight concern.  The segment shifted to sports, with Opie detailing an awkward encounter with a friend, Travis, related to Opie's accurate predictions of Travis's team's games.  A substantial portion focused on Frank McCourt's contentious Dodgers divorce and the subsequent MLB takeover, highlighting the financial mismanagement and alleged improprieties.  Finally, the show tackled the underrepresentation of Black players in hockey, prompting racially charged caller comments relayed without host intervention.  The Flyers/Sabres playoff series and MLB playoff expansion were also briefly discussed.

The next segment began with a nonsensical exchange about McCourt, then transitioned into a critique of athletes' post-game thank-yous to God, deeming them hypocritical.  This led to a discussion on the meaningless nature of celebrity apologies, using Lady Gaga's apology for using the word "retard" as an example.  The hosts discussed the casual use of offensive language ("nigger," "fag"), referencing their youth.  The absurdity of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal and a comedian fined for insulting a heckler was criticized.  A security camera recording of a street assault was played, followed by the hosts’ comedic remixing of the woman's screams with various soundtracks.  They also engaged in pun-based wordplay with author names.  A brief, bizarre interview with Mark McGrath, focusing on his houseplants, followed.  Opie concluded by teasing a video of a supposed Barbra Streisand sighting at a bus stop.

Opie showcased the video, sparking a debate amongst the hosts and in-studio guests, including Bjorn Lomborg ("Lomborg, not Borg"), on whether the woman was indeed Barbra Streisand.  Frame-by-frame analysis ensued, with varying levels of conviction.  The conversation transitioned to Lomborg's documentary on global warming, his disagreements with Al Gore, and his focus on technological solutions.  Jillian Jacobs from *Community* joined, discussing her role, past darker films, and experiences with Chevy Chase.  The show touched upon Chase's reputation.  Further discussion of *Community*'s success and comedic style concluded this segment.

A lengthy interview with Gillian Jacobs followed.  The conversation covered her work, leading to jokes about *The Cosby Show* and LeVar Burton.  Speculation about Joel McHale's potential hair transplant followed, transitioning to Jacobs' personal life, revealing her love for museums and past babysitting experience.  A discussion of modern art, specifically MoMA and controversial pieces like Chris Ofili's "The Holy Virgin Mary," and the Orange Gates installation in Central Park, ensued.  Comparisons to other actresses, including Anne Hathaway and Heather Graham, were made.  A playful exchange about dating and relationships included a story about Jacobs working with a former prostitute.  Clark Peters and Wendell Pierce from *The Wire* then joined. The discussion covered *The Wire*'s lack of awards, fan reactions, favorite scenes (including Omar Little's death), memorable characters, and working with David Simon.  The realistic portrayal of Baltimore, the show's language, and comparisons to *The Sopranos* and *House* were also discussed.  Their new HBO show, *Treme*, its musical elements, and realistic portrayal of post-Katrina New Orleans were highlighted. The segment ended with praise for both shows and an invitation for the actors to return.

The final segment discussed a presidential candidate (implied to be Donald Trump), focusing on their perceived unseriousness. Jokes about their candidacy and media portrayal as a frontrunner were made.  A humorous, derisive recounting of a previous environmentalist guest's appearance, described as a "snooze fest," followed.  The hosts thanked Clark Peters and Wendell Pierce, promoting the second season premiere of their show, concluding the broadcast with crude and offensive language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Kumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment  and having very few minutes.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny, and it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  The crazier, the better, yeah, yeah.  What, are you 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go fucking have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, yeah.  Sit back and enjoy the show.  The show.  The show.  For Friday.  Blah.  Friday, Friday, Friday, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun.  Party and party.  And what happened to her?  What happened to her?  Where'd she go?  She's still happening.  Where'd she go? 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, is she around?  Yeah, her and Big Voice Guy are going to do a collaboration.  Oh, yeah, a tour?  Yeah.  Big Voice Guy.  Where's homeless Ted Williams?  He's back to being a boom.  Do we know that for sure?  Oh, God.  Whatever happened to him?  I'm guessing rehab.  Boom.  No, he left rehab.  Left rehab.  I'm guessing again, though.  Because nothing has happened to him.  Unless they're filming him.  I think he just...  No, I think he's done.  I think he's like back being a bum.  No.  No?  No.  His shelf life kind of...  I mean, the internet fame shelf life is very short. 
[00:02:00]  It's very short these days.  He took his time where he was supposed to make his money,  and he wasted it by fucking up and going into rehab,  and now no one gives a shit.  That is true.  You've got to really strike while that iron's hot on the internet these days.  It's only hot for about 44 seconds.  And then you're done.  I think he's done.  I don't know.  I mean, the news should be following him.  They cared so much about the guy.  Why don't you keep following Mr. Ted Williams and see where he's at today?  That's what I would be doing.  He is so over that when you put the name into Google News, 
[00:02:30]  now you get baseball results again.  Baseball player, yeah, yeah.  That's how fucking nowhere this guy is.  Frozen heads, things like that.  But the point is, where the fuck is he?  Someone should be following him.  I honestly think he's backing me in a bum.  But even some stupid internet guy would have an update on that guy.  Grab a camera.  Like, where is he today?  Yeah, wait.  I'll tell you.  Right now.  What was the last update on Ted Williams?  This is the last thing I could find.  What day was that?  This was April 13th.  All right.  So that's nine days ago.  The Columbus homeless man who became an overnight star was back on Wednesday shooting a commercial 
[00:03:00]  and, let's put this in quotes here, a reality show, because that could end up anywhere.  And that could be anything.  We could be talking about like a TV guide show.  Yeah, yeah.  Ted Williams rose.  Oh, we don't need to know all that stuff.  So he's back in Columbus.  Yeah, back in Columbus shooting.  Filming a commercial.  So that means he's filming a commercial for a tire store or something.  Could be anything, yeah.  He really blew it.  He's doing a local commercial for somebody. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  That's where Ted Williams is.  There you go.  There's Ted Williams.  I'm going to get you a Louis Vuitton.  But the Friday girl is still...  Friday, Friday?  She's still hot.  What's she doing?  She's still doing Friday.  How many views does that thing have now?  Fun, fun, fun.  Fun, fun, fun.  Yeah, her name is popping up still here and there.  Rebecca Black, yeah.  You saw her, right, Jimmy?  We did Tonight Show together.  Tonight Show, yeah.  Was she sweet?  Very goofy, 13.  Girf.  She doesn't know any better.  No, it's exactly... 
[00:04:00]  I felt bad for her.  She got pushed into the fucking limelight.  No, I mean, we flirted a little bit.  We texted, but it got inappropriate quick.  Sexting.  A little sexting going on.  Yeah, no spelling errors were...  Horrendous.  You couldn't get off.  She didn't know what she was writing.  She was just so...  What?  How many views?  114.5 million views.  114.5 million views.  And that's the one version of the video.  I'm sure there's a few versions.  Well, that's the official line.  No, that's official.  That's fucking official. 
[00:04:30]  114 mil.  Damn.  That's creeping up on Lady Gaga numbers.  That's pretty huge.  She's heavily approaching Chalkerine numbers.  Chalkerine.  Does he have that many?  I think he's got way more than that.  Chalkerine is way the fuck up.  The fucking internet sensations, man.  But no one thinks about him anymore, either.  That's fine.  Chalkerine.  Oh, shit.  She might have surpassed Chalkerine.  Chalkerine.  Wow.  Holy fuck.  Wait a second.  The official version of Chalkerine?  I gotta see.  I listened to that again.  That was actually good.  You liked Chalkerine.  That fucking bitch is bigger than Chalkerine. 
[00:05:00]  Chalkerine's only got...  What?  How many?  65 and a half million.  65 and a half million.  She's not bigger than Charlie Bip My Finger, though, motherfucker.  Charlie.  She's not bigger than Charlie Bip My Finger, motherfucker.  Really?  Fucking finger, motherfucker.  Yeah, but where are those fucking rotten punk kids today?  Charlie Bip My Finger is easily like 330 million views.  That's 340.  That's astounding, by the way.  That's astounding.  I looked at that video the other day, and it's all right.  It is cute.  That's a good video, but it's not 300 and something million. 
[00:05:30]  Everyone in the country.  It's everyone in the country.  Yeah.  But again, everyone in the country has seen a lot of things.  Yeah, I know.  It's true.  It really is very cute.  But it is adorable.  Come on, Charlie.  Was your brother busted or something in a cigarette smuggling ring?  I don't think so.  Have you talked to him lately?  NotYouYou.com.  Is that them?  I thought it was NotYouYou.com.  NAPESAC. 
[00:06:00]  Hey, NAPESAC.  Hey, buddies.  How you doing?  Hey, man.  You got info on Ant's brother.  What's going on?  I know.  I think that they might want to get in line here for this domain name because it looks  like this place might get shut down because of all the taxes that aren't being paid.  It's some half of a million dollars or half of a million cars.  It's a note to act for something like $20 million.  So they're going to be, it looks like they're going to be shut down and he might be able to  clean the domain.  Get them a little bit.  Oh, 2U.com?  What?  What is it? 
[00:06:30]  Oh, it...  Oh, all right.  Goodbye.  I know what he's doing.  I have no idea.  There's a website called 2U.com.  Yeah.  And they got caught in some kind of cigarette smuggling ring.  Yeah, it's not Joe.  So now that website is going to go away, so he's...  Oh, so Joe could get it.  He's giving Joe the heads up that that domain name might be free soon.  Well, there you go.  Good for him.  All right.  I thought Brother Joe was in trouble for smuggling cigarettes or something.  I'd have probably heard about that.  Probably made me help bail him out or something. 
[00:07:00]  Bobo!  Yep, here.  Oh, God.  Are you ready for the one-man band today?  Yep, that's right.  The one-man band.  All right.  Now, just hold...  Yeah, explain some shit.  Is your mom home?  Oh, she's home this time.  They're both home this time.  And what are they doing right now?  Probably sleeping.  All right.  Where are you?  I'm in the kitchen.  You're in the kitchen very close to your mom and your sister, okay?  And what kind of stuff have you got for your one-man band today?  Hey, I got an air horn, a kazoo, a little noisemaker. 
[00:07:30]  Like, you use a New Year's and the pots and pans.  The pots and pans.  All right.  And what song did you practice?  I don't know.  Remember that original song you heard yesterday?  Oh, the original song about your dick?  Yeah.  Yeah, that song.  Oh, my God.  He's going to sing the My Dick's My Dick song?  Which is a great song, by the way.  Oh, it's fantastic.  It's just like Friday, Friday.  It should be the new Friday song.  Party and party and party and party.  We're expecting 150 million views for that song.  Please.  We just got to make a video. 
[00:08:00]  I'm going to be playing this on a kazoo.  All right.  That's fine.  I'm going to be playing this on a kazoo.  So it's Bobo's one-man band.  Are you ready, Bobo?  Now, wait.  I want to know, first of all, you're in the kitchen, right?  Yes.  How far from the kitchen is your mom's room and your sister's room?  It's a little bit of distance.  It's around somewhere in the middle.  Like, you can face the entrances to them.  All right.  That gives me no bearing on...  It's 15 feet away.  It's right there.  What I can tell you is it's very close, but it's really difficult to wake them up. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, is it?  Even with pots and pans?  Why?  You woke them up the other day?  Yeah.  Yeah, because of a loud noise.  All right.  Well, we expect a lot of loud noise right now, too.  All right?  All right.  All right.  The thing's in the middle of the kitchen.  Okay.  Ready?  Mm-hmm.  And go!  Bobo, one-man band.  What? 
[00:09:00]  Hey.  What?  Hey.  What?  What?  Who?  ...  Daniel?  Who?  What?  Where is the...  Hello?  Yeah?  Keep playing. 
[00:09:30]  What's wrong with you?  You're the one-man band.  Let's go.  Go, go, go.  Play.  Go.  And now he's the national anthem.  Go, go, go. 
[00:10:00]  I guess your mom's up? 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, she is.  Now just smash the pants together.  Go ahead.  Just smash them.  And say...  And keep going.  And sing, I'm sorry, mommy.  Yeah, yeah.  Go, I'm sorry, mommy.  Do the I'm sorry, mommy song.  Keep going.  Keep going. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, but you have to sing, I'm sorry, mommy.  I'm sorry, mommy.  And smash the pants.  Keep going.  Keep going.  I'm sorry, mommy.  I'm sorry, mommy.  I'm sorry, mommy.  I'm very sorry I woke you up in the morning.  I'm very sorry.  I'm very sorry.  Get a cap.  The boy is safe.  It's a big play door.  Daniel.  Daniel. 
[00:11:30]  That's beautiful.  That's a great way to wake someone up.  Wouldn't that be a great way to introduce Jimmy F. Foxwoods?  Oh, wow.  That's not a bad idea.  It certainly is.  It certainly is.  Wow, good job.  Excellent job.  Bobo.  Very funny.  Yeah, you guys got my name information, right?  What?  We'll make sure. 
[00:12:00]  For what?  What are you talking about?  Yeah.  You need to say, I'm on the phone, bitch.  I'm on the phone, bitch.  But, yeah, you got my name information, right?  For what?  I mean, so you can see Jimmy at Foxwood.  Yes, well, you can have a ticket, Daniel.  Yeah, we'll figure it out, though.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, guys. 
[00:12:30]  All right.  You guys have a great weekend, and happy birthday, Anthony.  Oh, thanks.  He probably met yesterday.  Well, I misread the date you said your birthday.  I was trying to remember, but I got a reminder.  I got so many birthdays, I got to remember in April.  You're falling apart here.  All right, Bobo.  You're unraveling.  You did good.  Good job.  Don't blow it.  All right, Bobo.  Great job.  Just start wishing everybody a happy birthday.  Leave on the high note.  Exactly.  Bobo in the one-man band.  There you go.  Excellent job.  I love Bobo.  How do you not love Bobo? 
[00:13:00]  Jesus.  Daniel, get you.  Get to bed.  The mother's just like, get in your room.  Oh, what is he doing again?  That was very Rupert Pupkin.  That was awesome.  Ma, I got to do this now.  That was a three-day buildup, but he pulled it off.  Finally did it.  Bobo pulled it off.  Holy shit.  Fantastic.  Oh, my God.  Absolutely.  You didn't watch hockey last night, did you?  No, no. 
[00:13:30]  I was on a red high.  Yeah, but you taped that shit.  Well, I have to, yeah.  Well, when I tape it, I think that's when the hockey's on.  Oh.  I do that.  How was that?  Good?  Yeah, that went very well.  Uh-huh.  I like that.  Uh-huh.  And then, uh, I did watch the last five seconds of the Bulls game.  Why?  You don't like basketball.  I know.  That's why I didn't even ask you about basketball.  It was on.  But they won.  Yeah, the Bulls are all right.  It was kind of an amazing, uh, really couple of seconds left, uh, shot there. 
[00:14:00]  Was it the last, uh, second victory?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  They were tied up.  Yep.  Yeah, I don't know who it was.  I think some black guy.  He, uh, he threw the ball into the round hoop thing.  What?  And, uh, got more points than the other black team.  Why did you stop on basketball?  Uh, no, it was, it was, it was on in the, uh, establishment I was in after Red Eye.  Oh, the bar.  Of course.  Did he go out with the guys?  Yeah, I went out for a little, uh, little, uh, wine with the guys and some din din. 
[00:14:30]  Nice.  And, uh, the basketball game was on.  Everybody was very excited about it.  Apparently it's a big thing.  Well, playoffs.  Playoff basketball and playoff, uh, hockey.  Damn.  I was texting Travis because his team was in, is one of the, and now he hates me and now  he's calling me the cooler.  I just, I just fucking suck.  He'll, he'll, he'll, he'll let you in on this one.  I'm watching the, uh, the, the Canadians and the Bruins.  This game was so unbelievable.  It really was.  It's what playoff hockey is all about.  The Habs. 
[00:15:00]  The Habs and the, and the Bruins.  And, and all of a sudden I go, I go, I gotta text Travis because I'm watching this game.  I don't even have a, I don't even have a team in this race or whatever you would want  to say, but I just love playoff hockey.  You go, Travis, what the fuck?  What a game.  Right?  Yeah.  And so, so then it goes to, it goes to overtime.  Sure.  I get a text from, from who I thought was my good friend, Opie.  Oh shit.  Saying good luck.  And about three minutes later, the fucking game is over.  Oh no.  I am the, I swear to God. 
[00:15:30]  Oh no.  I know we joke about it, but it's starting to get creepy.  It's no joke.  It's starting to get creepy.  I'm some weird fucking cooler or something.  You can make money off of that though.  Yeah.  But as soon as I fucking think I got some kind of weird gift, I'll, it'll go backwards.  It won't work.  It'll backfire.  Look, I wrote a, holy shit.  What a game pulling for your boys.  Oh no.  And that's what you do when, you know, that's what you, what you do when you know someone's  got a, got a team in the, in the game.  And then he writes, it's been a great game so far. 
[00:16:00]  Except for the Bruins not giving up.  The Bruins just, just kept pressing and pressing and pressing.  They kept coming back.  So then I wrote, uh, good luck as overtime is starting.  And then three minutes late.  I don't even think it was three minutes.  No.  And then he writes, my nerves can't handle this shit.  And then, and then nothing.  Because obviously the Bruins scored an OT and Travis was very sad.  So no more text messages from me or Travis.  Nobody.  So.  You just didn't text each other after the, uh. 
[00:16:30]  I felt like an ass.  I go, good luck as overtime's starting and it's team loses.  They scored a minute 59 into overtime.  Oh.  So.  Oh no.  Yeah, but I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, uh, put that three on one together.  No.  So how am I the problem?  How am I the cooler if all of a sudden there's a three on one against your team?  Because you have a history and now your history is starting to affect me personally.  It's just some kind of a.  All right, I won't text you anymore.  Affecting you personally?  I won't text you anymore.  He's very upset. 
[00:17:00]  It was fun and games when it was just a radio bit.  It was fun when it wasn't your team.  Yeah, exactly.  And then I decided to focus on the Canadians out of nowhere.  Good luck, bro.  It was a great game though.  It's bizarre.  I haven't had a winning team.  I can't even tell you.  I don't even know the last time I actually rooted for somebody that actually, uh, you  know, went all the way.  But, uh, playoff hockey, holy shit, isn't it great?  Nothing better.  And what were you telling me?  Half, almost half the games, uh.  Less than half.  Huh?  Less than half.  Less than half of the games are being won by the home team?  Yeah. 
[00:17:30]  You know how fucked up that is?  Wow.  And not just in this series, in all of playoff hockey.  The visiting team is winning, um, you know.  Now why is that?  Does it matter as much in hockey because of the way the ice is?  There's no home.  Is there a home ice advantage?  You still get that crowd.  When you get that crowd behind you.  You still have the crowd behind you.  I mean, in football, they have to yell the plays out.  In baseball, you have last ups.  There's, like, advantages to certain.  But in hockey, it doesn't really...  We're still making plays in hockey.  They're not just, like, running around without a...  Are they yelling at each other, though?  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:18:00]  It's a good...  No, just get out on the ice and just hit that puck.  No, no, but I mean, the yelling is so random.  It's almost like in football when you're trying to...  It's not as important to be heard on the ice as it is on a football field, I would say.  Blue!  42!  And they're all yelling, and then you have to do hand signals.  Yeah.  And then the quarterback tries to make it quiet.  And then they try to get quiet everyone down.  That doesn't work.  Well, when you've got a crowd on your side, when you're on a stage...  I wouldn't know.  It pumps you up, man.  It just helps you to have your home team.  When the sixth man is behind you. 
[00:18:30]  A lot of people...  A lot of great players have said they enjoy when the crowd hates them.  They said the best sound you can hear is not cheers.  It is silence.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  In your opponent.  Wow.  Like, a lot of players, ballplayers, love the booing because it's a sign of respect.  Right.  They hate you so much because you kill their team.  Yeah.  I like...  I like...  You know, a lot of people say baseball.  But I do like when the opposing team's crowd...  They're just yelling, yelling.  And then you shut them the fuck up with a home run. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Or a really good fucking hit.  And it just...  And the commentator's like, well, that quieted the crowd down here.  A lot of...  Oh, it's great.  It's what Curt Schilling said.  Like, the best moment of his career was going into Yankee Stadium and just shutting up every single person.  I didn't mean that.  No, but, you know, just like that.  With his bloody sock.  He's a hero.  With him in his bloody sock.  I twat enough.  Hate him.  I hope he's dead.  Raging Mad from Canada.  I think he's a Canadiens fan.  He writes, tell Hope that's why the Islanders suck. 
[00:19:30]  If he changes teams, the Islanders will probably win the cup.  Let me tell you something about it.  Drive for five.  When the Islanders were sucking so fucking bad, I made a couple of dumb videos where I was throwing my tickets away instead of going to the games.  And I only went to one other...  I think I went to one game in the second half of the season, maybe two.  And I had season tickets.  Yeah.  And the Islanders had one of the better second halves in the entire league.  Yeah.  But they were so gone because of the first half, you know, they still look like a shitty team.  But the fact is, the Islanders were really good in the second half when I gave up on them and stopped going to the games. 
[00:20:00]  That sports curse thing...  It's fucking weird, man.  It's not 100%.  We know that.  It's a weird thing.  But there's something odd there.  Yeah.  There's something weird.  It's strange.  And then when people...  Then something will happen and people go, I guess his sports curse is over.  Yeah.  But then something like last night happened.  It's just sleeping.  Weren't you guys up 3-1?  Yes.  He was up 3-1.  3-1.  3-1 in hockey.  You got it in the bag.  No.  I mean, look, I know Boston's a great team. 
[00:20:30]  And so 3-1, I'm just sitting thinking, well, good, they have a two-goal lead, but...  You got one of my favorite players, too.  Wisniewski.  Oh, yeah.  I thought you were going to say it.  I always fuck up his name.  Wisniewski.  Wisniewski used to be on the Islanders.  They traded him this year.  And he played for the Canadians.  He's an animal, man.  We also have one of the most hated players.  Which one?  P.K. Saban.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Nobody likes him.  Yeah.  He's a jerk-off.  Is he?  Really?  And we used to have Chara, too.  The Islanders used to have everybody that was good in the world.  Chara is playing hockey? 
[00:21:00]  Chara.  Chara.  What's wrong with her?  Not Chara.  Chara.  Oh, I thought it was Chara the Coochie Coochie Girl.  He's the monster on skates.  With skates, he's almost 7 foot tall.  Oh.  And he's a left-hander defenseman that fucking shoots...  Does he goon it up?  Yeah, he's the guy that...  Oh, wait a minute.  That doesn't make any sense.  He's good, too.  He scored last night, right?  He's good, yeah.  I almost tweeted, and I'm like, man, this is something maybe I should give Ant to tweet.  I go, did I just see a black guy scoring hockey?  It's like, wait a minute, what? 
[00:21:30]  He's 21.  He's really good.  But it's really rare to see a black guy scoring hockey.  It really is.  It's rare to see the, you know...  Maybe he's like an enforcer, but, you know...  There's more black guys in hockey.  It's, I mean, nothing like any other sport, but to actually see someone of color score is  still really strange in the year 2011.  You know, people of color.  Yeah, I know.  What are you going to do?  Blacks just never loved hockey.  No.  It's just, I don't know why it's... 
[00:22:00]  They should.  There's no risk of drowning.  It's ice.  It's ice.  That's...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my goodness.  But is it a...  Is it an expensive hobby?  Like, basketball's cheap.  Hockey's not.  It probably is growing up.  Like, you gotta...  I'm saying.  You need rink time.  It's expensive if you live on Long Island and you're trying to make it in the NHL, but  these guys that live in Canada, all they need is a stupid pond and a couple sticks.  This is a list of all African-American hockey players right now. 
[00:22:30]  You can say black.  Like, African-American.  Well, no, but it's not, because I see some Canadian flags there.  They're not African-Americans.  No, they're not African-Americans.  This is where all the black people...  Yeah.  Black people.  This is all the black people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, I mean, look at how many are from Canada.  Wow.  Yeah, look at that.  The overwhelming majority.  Oh, my God.  That's what they do up there.  That's every black guy in Canada, by the way, is in the NHL.  It's amazing.  Do you think that's because it's just, it's so cold up there, they have ponds and shit  like that, whereas here you don't have as many of the cities... 
[00:23:00]  Well, I think what happened is the slave trade back in the old days, they got stronger ankles  and they would breed their hockey player with the female slave.  So, Jimmy the Greek, no?  Yeah.  I'm actually debating if you're right.  No, but it's probably because up there you could just...  It's probably because there weren't a lot of black people in Canada, because a lot of  the guys come from Canada.  That's what I would...  And they're probably those Canadian...  Are they those French-Canadian black guys?  A lot of them, sure.  They wear a beret. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, oh.  Well, Subban's from Toronto, so he's not...  Subban.  Oh, okay.  But I think it's just like, you know, that's their national pastime.  Like, here, everyone plays baseball.  Well, that's true.  And they play hockey.  Hey, another story.  What do we know on the fucking Dodgers situation?  I only...  Wow, they're ready to take that.  They're moving to Los Angeles team.  I only saw a piece of that, but an ugly divorce and what?  Major League Baseball's taking over the team?  Misappropriations of funds and irresponsibility. 
[00:24:00]  I heard the divorce is so ugly, like, is it a couple sons are being paid and they don't  have anything to do with the Dodgers?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, this owner, what's his name?  They hate him in L.A.  Maybe someone in L.A. could help me out with this story.  Maybe they were all dodging the law or something.  Oh, boy, that's a good one.  Thanks.  Frank McCourt.  Wait, New Dodgers exec says selling's move irresponsible because Bud wants to take over  the team?  They did take...  They took financial control over the team.  When?  Yesterday?  Two days ago.  Two days ago.  What's the Dodgers owner doing wrong? 
[00:24:30]  He's in this ugly fucking divorce.  Yeah, they kind of don't have the money to run the team.  Because...  Why?  I don't know how you buy a baseball team and then just don't have the money to run it.  Is the divorce getting a little ugly?  Is that what's happening?  The divorce is getting ugly.  They've used funds for things that...  Not paying the players.  Other things.  I think misappropriation of funds.  Yeah.  And then security in the parking lot.  I guess some gentleman, a Giants fan, got the living shit beat out of him. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, they like to beat fans in a coma.  Yeah.  And he was in a coma for a couple of days.  That would have nothing to do with the team being...  Right.  Well, it was just another thing about...  Taking over by Major League Baseball.  It was just another thing.  And then they're talking about...  I was listening to a little radio and they were saying, what about the Mets?  The Mets are in financial straits because of the Bernie Madoff connection that the Mets had.  But they said the Mets owner is a responsible guy. 
[00:25:30]  He's beloved in baseball.  And he's doing a job trying to sell off a minority part of the team.  Not sell off the minorities on the team.  That would make it an awful team.  Sure, a bunch of white guys.  That would make it an awful thing, Steve.  Horrible.  And so, a minority portion of the team.  In Los Angeles Times reported last week that McCord has arranged a $30 million loan from Fox, 
[00:26:00]  the team's television partner.  Selig has not approved a $200 million loan from Fox to the club,  which was first proposed by the Dodger last summer.  And the Times said the money was needed to make payroll.  Jesus.  So you're ready to take a loan out.  You're just trying to take two loans out.  Two loans out.  It seems pretty obvious that Selig doesn't want this guy owning the Dodgers.  No.  Is what it comes down to.  I mean, and the Dodgers, like, they're an important franchise.  Oh, shit.  But if I'm saying it's not like the Marlins, you know. 
[00:26:30]  Right.  Kansas City Royals.  No offense to the Kansas City people, but we don't think Royals ever.  Dude, when you're worth a couple hundred million, you never want to be going through an ugly divorce.  Oh, God.  What do you think this guy did where the wife is turning the streets?  Dude, he's hemorrhaging me.  Oh, you know what he probably did?  He probably supported her.  You know, came home with a lot of money, made a career, gave her a great home. 
[00:27:00]  And, you know, she's got to live the lifestyle she's accustomed to.  That is annoying.  Unless you get to fuck him.  Yeah.  I used to come in her mouth.  I hope he was hitting her.  I want the lifestyle I'm accustomed to.  All right, I'll come over and beat the shit out of you every week.  Give you a good elbow to the cheekbone.  Oh, look at her.  She looks like a man.  Give me some of the juicy shit from the McCourt divorce case.  Hey, do you guys want a reason why blacks aren't in hockey?  Yes.  But I want to know why Ron Wood is on his screen.  Oh, there's that lady. 
[00:27:30]  Jesus.  I'm a fuckable beast.  Divorcing Ron Wood.  Here's the racist reason right here.  Oh, racist reason.  John in Philly, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey, the reason that the blacks are not in hockey is,  I hope you know notoriously that hockey players,  when they're such a little kids,  have to get up at like four in the morning.  So the blacks don't like to get up early.  Yeah, blacks hate getting up early.  Wow, that coming from Philly.  No surprise there.  Thank you, John.  Hey, yo.  Blood bass tonight with Buffalo.  What?  What's going to happen? 
[00:28:00]  Blood bass tonight with Buffalo.  At the end of that game the other night.  I know.  I'm getting shit because I'm sort of pushing for the Flyers  because I got a lot of family down there,  but I have roots in Buffalo,  so all the Buffalo people are beating the shit out of me.  You got to pick a territory.  But at least I picked somebody.  I'm not like Hillary Clinton where I put on a different hat  every fucking time she goes into a baseball park  or the rest of them.  Does Obama commit to a fucking team?  I think he does.  What is he?  Chicago guy, man.  Is he a white socks?  White socks, I think. 
[00:28:30]  But at least he admits it  because most politicians can't even pick a fucking sports team.  Bloomberg won't admit it either.  Bloomberg won't.  I mean, Bush, Texas Rangers, Bush, the Texas guy.  Most politicians, though, they will not pick a fucking team.  Who did?  Giuliani was always a Yankee fan.  Very Yankee guy.  And who else?  Hillary.  About million men in the Red Sox.  Well, but he only has one team up there.  I mean, Bloomberg's got the Mets and Yankees,  and he refuses to pick a team. 
[00:29:00]  What a fucking loser.  I hate that shit.  I dislike the way all of their asses look in the uniforms.  I really do when they're driving down one lane on Broadway  and they're looking at potted flowers.  I dislike the way all of their bodies look in their uniforms.  Mets suck so bad, it would be easy just to pick the Yankees.  The Mets are, I think, 6-13.  They're starting to compare them to the 1962 Mets, matter of fact.  Big story in the paper today.  But I had to pick fucking Flyers over the Sabres,  and it's killing me.  Trust me. 
[00:29:30]  That's going to happen, brother.  But that series is a, you've got to watch the Flyers and the Sabres.  I mean, just take a little look at this playoff hockey,  and I'm telling you, it's way the fuck better than the regular season.  Right, Travis?  How ridiculous is it?  Playoff hockey, sorry.  Why is that?  Why don't they play like that all year?  Because these games count.  Oh.  But if you remember, I had a whole discussion on this.  I'm saying hockey is one of those sports,  they really need to cut down the amount of games they play,  and you would see a lot more excitement.  Yeah.  These guys skate so much faster and push forward the entire game. 
[00:30:00]  It's like, where is this during the regular season?  It's really strange where both teams agree to, you know, not go at half pace.  I mean, that's an exaggeration.  But they definitely are slower, because it's such a long season.  Now every game counts, so you see what these guys can really fucking do.  Yeah, there's just such an elevated level of excitement.  It's so different.  The intensity.  All right.  I think it's way more different than any other sport as far as regular season to playoffs.  I really do.  You'd think you would do that, though.  I think football, even, every game is pretty fucking intense. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, it's hyped up a little bit for the playoffs.  Baseball, same thing.  But this hockey is so much different in the playoffs.  You'd think one day, like one game a week or something, you'd say,  all right, we're going to play this one like it's the playoffs.  Like, push like a motherfucker.  There's really no reason.  Right from the beginning.  You look at the standings, you know, like, okay, we got a little cushion here.  I mean, they're playing hard enough to win, obviously.  I don't want to fucking, you know, beat the shit out of the guys.  But there's obviously something that happens with playoff hockey. 
[00:31:00]  That makes sense, though, because you know that this is it.  So it's like when you have football 16 games and hockey is a shitload of games,  we're going to get hurt in the 11th or 40th game.  It's like you have too many to go.  40th game.  What's hockey?  81, 82?  82 games.  Yeah, so imagine if it was 42 fucking games.  That's a lot, though, for a physical sport like that.  It's crazy.  80?  Yeah, yeah.  82 or whatever?  That is a lot.  What's the basketball season about?  Because when you look at football, obviously those guys can't play too many more games a season.  They don't want to play one more game. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, they don't even want to play one more game.  They're trying to get them to play.  Football is the ultimate because every game feels like you're watching some kind of playoff game.  Yeah.  Every game seems to matter.  And everybody's life is in danger and career is in danger every game.  Baseball.  Baseball is just like, let's play 150,000 games.  But God bless fucking people that could follow a 162-game season in the year 2011.  I'll say it again, 2011. 
[00:32:00]  I don't understand it anymore.  I will tell you, only the hardest core fan watches every game.  I mean, honestly, you can't watch every game.  It's part of the fucking wallpaper at this point.  It's just with you for eight months.  And the paper said today, Buncelli, 2012, they're going to add more fucking playoff games.  Yeah, I hate him.  What an idiot.  Doesn't it seem like sometimes you're watching a game and then you don't watch, like, it just 
[00:32:30]  seems like you didn't watch for two days.  And you heard it's like, well, the Yankees' losing streak continues.  And then, like, two days later, it's like, what a winning streak the Yankees are having.  What the, what, they play 20 fucking games?  I missed two days.  You know, a bunch of listeners were calling me, because, you know, when I talk baseball,  it's pretty obvious that I'm not a baseball fan.  And I still, I'll be honest, I still thought I was in my head.  And the listeners actually turned me and made me realize, no, I'm not a baseball fan.  I just, it's kind of like I was brought up with the Mets, so I just kept assuming I was a Mets fan. 
[00:33:00]  And then, if you called me out on it, I couldn't even name six Mets players right now, I don't think.  And they're right.  I have to say they're right.  I had to realize through them that, holy shit, I don't know shit about the Mets anymore.  And the Mets, not really a team that you're trying to remember names.  They're only the worst team in baseball.  Yes, only.  Brand new fucking stadium.  But it's easy to say.  Giant payroll.  Yikes.  Embarrassing.  It's easy to say this this year, yes. 
[00:33:30]  But I'm talking even five years ago when I was telling people I'm a Mets fan.  Yeah, yeah.  Holy shit, I'm not a Mets fan.  I'm not a...  Like this on there?  Yes, you are.  You're just not a fucking...  Not really, man.  You're not a fucking hardcore idiot.  Dude, I know more...  Who lives and dies with a bunch of fucking guys who wear cups.  I like that Al Leiter.  Is he pitching tonight?  Yeah, exactly.  What?  I know more about the Phillies and more Phillies players and been to more Phillies games than the  Mets in the last, I've been to six, seven years.  Yeah.  I've been to way more Phillies games.  Then you're a Phillies fan. 
[00:34:00]  I don't know, man.  I think in a weird way, I might be starting to become a Phillies fan over a Mets fan.  It might be the first team they grab from me.  My kid, fuck that though.  My kid, I'll allow him to be a Phillies fan.  No fucking way is he going to be an Eagles fan.  He's going to be Jets.  I got to lay it out for him.  Got to go Knicks.  You got the little clothes already?  And got to go fucking Islanders if they still stick around.  You got the little clothes?  I like when the parents buy the clothes.  It's like, here's your fucking team.  Oh, yeah.  You are, and it's stronger than religion.  I just got some new Oriole gear from my daughter in the mail yesterday. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, the poor kids.  Why?  Because we're going to game next month.  Why?  Because she's got to support the team.  She doesn't.  I'm sure she does.  People will ingrain sports teams more than religion, which, you know, that's fine.  Believe me.  I think it's great.  But they really do just pass on their own team to their children.  She wasn't even one, and we had her in a Canadian's jersey.  Oh, God.  Because why not?  You got to wear clothes, right?  Because why not?  And it's adorable. 
[00:35:00]  No, they don't.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  But you see that thing you brought up?  Travis brought up an answer for the Dodgers.  Oh.  And it just, Jamie McCourt is the woman that says she served as the Dodgers CEO and told  her then-husband fired her in 09, and then she filed for divorce, ending the 30-year marriage.  So I guess it was probably...  Can I ask the first question here?  Sure.  Why was she made the CEO?  Was she brought up in baseball?  I do not know.  I mean, I'm not saying a woman couldn't do that job.  I'm not that guy.  But it seems suspicious that he gave her a nice gig because they were married. 
[00:35:30]  I don't know.  Does anyone know the answer to that?  She did have some balls across the chin once.  I think that's her only qualification.  Thank you.  Because I hate when you got a president and all of a sudden the first lady all of a sudden  becomes an expert because she's married to the president.  It's bullshit.  Yeah.  If she was brought up in politics, that's one thing.  Oh, another great thing is like when, what is that, like a congressman dies or something 
[00:36:00]  like that?  Oh, that's even a better one.  What's that about?  What?  Who did that?  What does the wife know?  Bono?  Sonny Bono did that and then his wife stepped in.  Yeah, there's been a few of those.  Like, that don't make sense.  No.  Does she know anything about politics just because she was married to the guy?  I don't know.  She's seen you, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  No, no.  It's a good question.  The ex-wife of the Dodgers owner Frank McCord accused her ex-husband Tuesday of making financial  deals that concern the team behind her back in violation of a court order. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, boy.  So she's seeking half-ownership of the team under California community property.  Holy shit.  And she says that she has the right to know about its financial dealings as any non-marital  business partner would.  You know what?  I don't know what she contributed financially to.  I have no idea what their marriage was.  Every fucking divorce sucks ass.  But that fucking California has got to be the worst place to get a divorce.  No wonder people just fucking kill their wives in California instead of getting a divorce. 
[00:37:00]  Because it's just abominable.  They get half the shit no matter what.  It's in the fucking law.  Well, I just talked to a woman who was the breadwinner and is getting divorced.  And, you know, she made a lot of money and her husband didn't.  More sat on the couch, did nothing.  And she's going through hell financially.  She's like, he's trying to fucking get every...  Like, whoever the breadwinner is, the other person tries to fuck...  And it's 98% of the time it's the guy getting fucked by the woman. 
[00:37:30]  Of course.  But I just happened to talk to her chick.  Oh, that's what you're going to say.  It's sickening.  Scott Peterson.  Oh, whoops.  But he was being a piece of...  He was like having...  If you throw your pregnant wife, it's like he was just being a twat.  How do you think you're getting along with it?  I don't think they were getting divorced, were they?  Well, they didn't need to.  I think he wanted to.  Oh, I see.  But, you know, instead of getting divorced, you do that.  All right, you guys want to know more about...  Wow, we got people that know about this situation.  All right.  Situation.  Knows why they're adding extra playoff games.  Yeah, let's start from the top.  A lot of calls coming in. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, Bud Seller gets in the paper today.  Once they had a couple more teams in the playoffs in 2012, that's so stupid.  Because then the 162-game season is going to mean less and less.  It'll be easier to get in the fucking playoffs.  Yeah.  This is all just for money.  Of course.  Man.  Well, how many teams are in the playoffs?  I don't even know that.  There's 18.  So we're up to eight.  Yeah.  So what does he want?  He wants ten.  Ten?  Oh, there you go.  Wait, ten.  He wants a third of baseball to make the playoffs.  A third of baseball.  He's such a fucking asshole.  Meanwhile, he wouldn't give that guy the perfect game, even though it was clear the guy was out 
[00:38:30]  and the ump said he was wrong.  Well, Jim, you don't want to open up Pandora's Bob.  I fucking hate Bud Seller.  I hate him.  He's a fucking coward.  Sometimes you just gotta do what's right.  Exactly.  Everyone knew what the right thing to do there was, and he decided to fucking ignore  all of it.  Yeah, he's a piece of shit.  That meant that...  Because baseball's so fucking sacred, right?  Oh, yeah.  They have integrity.  Oh, fuck yourself.  Mistakes are part of the game.  So the guy literally is wrong.  And your achievement doesn't mean anything.  It's just fucking crap.  And is that guy even in baseball anymore? 
[00:39:00]  I don't even know his name.  I'm not sure.  We all knew his name a year ago, right?  Armando Gallagher.  Oh, you know.  Good for you, Travis.  Now, Frank McCord claims, by the way...  Is he the writer?  Oh.  Isn't there a writer that has a name kind of like that?  Frank McCord.  Who am I thinking of?  Charles McCord, who's obviously the right-hand guy.  Oh, yeah.  That's true.  No.  Who am I thinking?  Someone will get it.  Frank McCord?  That name sounds like it's...  All right.  I'm going to Google.  Let's go to Nate in D.C.  Google.  Nate, go ahead.  Hey, what's up, guys?  The whole thing with this playoff is Seahawks is trying to implement a one-game playoff between 
[00:39:30]  these teams.  So that first place means more, and that the regular season, everyone should be  gunning for first place rather than a 500 record.  Is that what he says?  Wait, I...  Bullshit, yeah.  Wait.  So there's going to be a one-game playoff for two more teams?  Yeah.  Now, the players want it to be a three-game because, obviously, they get incentives for  postseason and stuff.  But he wants one game, so everybody's gunning for perfection, quote-unquote, regular season. 
[00:40:00]  Later.  All right.  Later.  All right.  We're getting the cool sports callers now.  They're just like, yeah, later.  You guys want to know why blacks aren't in hockey?  Yes.  I know Ron knows.  He's from Canada.  Yeah, another racist answer.  Ron in Canada.  Go ahead, Ron.  Morning, boys.  Good morning, Ron.  Hi.  Yeah.  Urban legend has it that, and I've played hockey for 14 years, that their ankles, their  ankle burners, they just can't support the skates. 
[00:40:30]  You don't see them in, like, speed skating or hockey or anything to do with skates.  Damn, burn!  So, riddle me this, though.  Sure.  If your ankles are weak, how come Kenyans time and time again win every marathon?  Because they're not on skates, man.  Yeah, but skates, you're running, and your ankles have to be pretty strong when you're,  you know, pounding the pavement.  Man, you were watching basketball last night. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  With weak ankles, you're jumping up and down like that.  Yeah, and you're making, like, turns on a dime and on a wooden floor.  And you're riding on skates.  Yes, yes.  I know sneakers have some good supports.  Actually, hockey, a skate has way more support.  Oh, my God.  Skates are like, yeah.  You feel like you've got a cast on when you go skating.  I don't even think you can turn your ankle in skates.  Yeah.  Well, you've inline skated or whatever, right?  All right.  Maybe I did.  You know it's a bit of a difference. 
[00:41:30]  By the way, can I update my profile?  I haven't done that in probably, let me think, probably five to six years.  I bike now.  Okay.  But I don't do the Lance Armstrong biking shit.  No, you don't put on the...  Where you can see my cock bulge.  The big cock bulge suit.  Just because I need to take a loop around the park.  What the fuck's wrong with these guys?  I'm not trying to infer anything.  You don't wear the spandex suit with the fucking Italian sponsors all over it and the helmet.  I'm going to make a cock bulge montage video soon. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, nice.  Why do you have to dress like that to do a loop in Central Park on a bike?  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, all right.  So maybe I did a little inline skating.  We don't call it rollerblading.  I'm not trying to make any through.  No.  I'm just saying that, you know, it's not the same as running.  You need a little bit...  You know, your ankles need to be a little bit more sturdy, a little bit more stable.  Listen, all I know is I played for 14 years and there was like a handful of black guys  and they seemed to drop off like flies, like, you know, by the time they were like 10. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Wow.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Interesting.  Thank you, sir.  Sorry.  And Josh in New Hampshire.  No, I'm not thinking of Gary McCord.  Yeah, I think you're thinking of Gary McCord.  The golf announcer.  No, there's some writer that has a name similar to McCord.  Help me out, somebody.  I'm floundering.  10-10 wins?  What's his name?  It's Charles McCord.  No, I know Charles McCord. 
[00:43:00]  Someone wants to know if you're thinking of Troy McClure.  Troy McClure.  Troy McClure.  All right, we got more guys that want in on the doctor.  Or perhaps you want to know what holds up me laundry.  You fuckers.  What?  McCord.  Someone talk to Scott and Callie.  I'm fucking Googling today.  Unfortunately, I do.  Perhaps you'd like to know how much wood I put in my fireplace.  How many?  McCord.  Put McCord of wood in the fireplace. 
[00:43:30]  I just call McCord.  I'm going to get this.  Talk to this sucker.  Perhaps you'd like to know where I get my rope hamburgers from.  Oh, no, you didn't.  Yes, I did.  McCord.  They're coming to the rope buns.  I'm tired.  How do you plug stuff in?  What's that?  How do you plug stuff in?  You just stick it in the wall.  What are you talking about?  Oh, no.  I'm just kidding.  You use my plug cords. 
[00:44:00]  I'm getting too anxious.  It happens.  Talk to this guy.  Scott in California.  Is his name in the hand?  Pat.  Good morning, boys.  Pat McCord.  Hey.  I guess that.  No.  His last name is Maffani.  I was going to say, hey, I guess that apparently with the documents on the ownership of the  Dodgers, three of them say that only Frank owns it, and then the other three say they  both own it.  Oh, shit.  So no one even knows who owns the team.  Fucking assholes in California. 
[00:44:30]  They're in court arguing who even owns the fucking team.  So, of course, Major League Baseball has to take it over.  They had to at that point.  There was something about Frank that he was leveraging money against the Dodgers, too,  or something.  Oh, he was taking money out?  Yeah.  Is that like a reverse mortgage on the team, where you slowly just lose the team?  Dude.  Yeah, pretty much.  Thank you.  I fucking Googled.  This Google's amazing.  What do we got?  Really?  You just put on to that. 
[00:45:00]  There's a fucking writer, Frank McCourt.  He was the one that wrote Angela's Ashes.  Paul's a prize winner, Frank McCourt.  Okay.  Thank you.  Oh, that.  Fuck, I knew I was into something.  Oh, I didn't think he meant him.  I would have said that.  Yeah, I would have said that.  Yes, I might have known it was McCourt.  Yes.  It's the same exact fucking name.  I thought you wanted to know where I had to go to see McJudge.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, brother.  Mark in Chicago has got a little twist on this Dodger situation. 
[00:45:30]  Mark in Chicago.  Hey, guys, Anthony had it backwards.  He clumped off of her.  She's the corporate lawyer.  She brought the money.  He ran a parking lot.  They're from Boston.  Oh, yeah?  It's not on the Red Sox.  Selig put them into L.A. when the Dodgers were for sale.  And Selig, to answer your question, is the world's biggest asshole.  In terms of the baseball playoffs, everything Selig does is for one thing only.  Freaking money.  The almighty dollar. 
[00:46:00]  They've got us by the purse strings.  Of course they're doing it for money.  For fucking money.  Yeah, okay.  The value of baseball.  I play 162 games.  You play one game after 162 to make a playoff.  Well, then how about this?  It's going to go seven games.  And Anthony, the almighty should have taken fucking River Air out after the game of the  single.  What the hell was going on with that?  If all these dumb fans stopped going and told baseball to go fuck itself.  By the way, I want to talk to Chip.  Chip, you missed the whole fucking great setup. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, he said, I don't know shit about the match.  I thought Chip might have said, I don't know shit about any team.  You guys have a good weekend.  All right.  Way to hit a home run and bail out.  See, this radio thing's hard to do.  Oh, yeah, not quite as easy as it looks or sounds.  It's kind of hard to do.  You should appreciate us, you fuckers.  Wait, the guy ran a parking lot?  And then she was a corporate lawyer and they got together and now they own the Dodgers?  She was an attorney for like 15 years and then she did some other business stuff.  Wow.  So she checks out. 
[00:47:00]  So she may have been the brains of the operation, as they say.  Well, now we got the wife who had some kind of affair.  Ken and Jersey.  Ken?  That's what's being alleged.  Yeah, I actually read yesterday in the paper that, yeah, she supposedly had an affair with  like a chauffeur or something.  Oh, no.  They said the driver and then Morgan Freeman's denying the whole thing happened.  He said Jessica Tandy shit her pants and he was just wiping her.  Oh, my God.  Getting back to the ankles with, you know, black guys have weak ankles for ice skates. 
[00:47:30]  Didn't black guy win the speed skating like gold medal?  You know, I didn't want to speak too soon, but I vaguely remember there was a black speed  skater that was pretty amazing.  Really?  I don't know if he won the gold, but I kind of remember something like that.  Yeah, I think it was speed skating.  Is he the best in the world?  I don't know, no.  I know he's the exception, I guess.  All right.  Hey, Dave and Philly might have more on that, actually.  Dave, go ahead. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, hey, how's it going?  His name is Shani Davis, S-H-A-N-I.  I kind of remember that.  There was a really good black speed skater.  Yeah, he's a black American.  But the reason why blacks don't play hockey is that they don't have dads.  Dads take you to the rink.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  This fucking Philly.  We've heard nothing but complete stereotype racist reasons why black people don't play  hockey.  Fucking Philly.  Because the dads take you to the rink.  How am I part of this fucking area?  Jesus. 
[00:48:30]  Holy shit.  I do know the answer, but I don't want to say it.  Oh, let's see.  It's not going to...  All right.  Jesus Christ.  I can't even read that last word.  Really?  You can't?  Oh, yeah.  You should be able to read that.  It's hard to fit a skate.  No, no, no.  Wrong extremity.  Oh, no. 
[00:49:00]  Jesus Christ.  There you have it for our first hour of radio.  All right.  Amazing one.  There it is.  I think we should say it all together.  You're welcome.  Yeah.  We're the audience, so you're welcome.  Exactly.  Correctamundo.  Yeah.  It sounds like Frank McCourt was kind of like just owned parking lots before he married  this woman.  So she had money when she married him?  Yeah.  He founded the McCourt Company, which specializes in the development of major commercial real  estate projects, particularly parking lots. 
[00:49:30]  I thought it was where you played McBasketball.  It's fun, isn't it?  It is very fun.  Trying to think it up.  McCourt.  Don't make fun of him.  Oh, I didn't know how much my milk I needed.  Get me in McCourt.  Because I had a McGowan, but I spilled it on my floor.  No use my crying.  Yes.  Over my spilt, my milk. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, fuck.  All right.  I like the sports callers, though.  They're very adamant.  They're very in there, the sports callers, aren't they?  They kind of know their shit.  Yeah.  They're all guessing.  I can imagine that all day, though.  Wow.  That would fucking be just infuriating.  Sports talk radio is fucking horrendous.  I don't know how they did it.  It's unlistenable.  You get the basics out, and then you've got to move on. 
[00:50:30]  In five minutes, I'm done.  All right, you know, they've got to start hitting the ball.  Really?  Fuck you.  I hate athletes.  They're so fucking, they're so uninsightful.  They give you nothing but A, B, and C.  Not one ounce of, yeah, well, you know, we played a good game.  We just got to keep playing.  How about you say something with the fucking magic talk device in front of you?  Fucking assholes.  It really is the same shit, right? 
[00:51:00]  Same shit every time.  Yeah.  All right, you know, we went out there, we played our game.  I heard that already.  In 1980, I heard that.  Steve Garvey said that on the Dodgers.  They've not changed.  I gave 110%.  Oh, fuck.  I'm not a fan of the over 100% thing.  Right, it's impossible.  It's impossible.  100% is good enough.  That's the best you can do.  But these go to 11.  Right.  Left it all on the field.  You know, that's all you can do. 
[00:51:30]  I play it with my heart.  Hey, you don't.  That would be messy.  I want to thank God.  Exactly.  That drives me nuts, because I think there's players on the other team that kind of wanted  God to help them out, too.  So what, God decided that this guy is a better God person than the other God person?  They're a great organization.  They came to play.  They came to play.  We just didn't have enough.  Who doesn't come to play?  Yeah, you put on the uniform.  Right.  I think you came to play.  Even the stupid manager in baseball came to play. 
[00:52:00]  He came to play.  He looks like he might go out there.  They all come to play.  Yeah.  We can get that out of the way immediately.  I want to thank Jesus Christ for helping me to perform.  He might not be able to hear me, because a lot of people in Japan are bullying him right  now.  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe some other prayers.  He was concentrating on me fucking hitting the three-pointer at halftime.  Yeah.  And not on the fucking lives he was ruining by flooding the entire country.  The entire country.  And the nuclear meltdown.  Right.  And he wasn't thinking about the nuclear meltdown, though.  He was concentrating on me hitting the three. 
[00:52:30]  He wanted to make sure LeBron James had a good game last night.  Of course.  He didn't give a fuck about the radiation going into the ocean of all places.  Well, thank God.  Right.  Yeah.  Athletes.  I hate when athletes do the God thing.  Whenever they thank God, I just want to scream, shut the fuck up.  Them and actors, yeah.  If it's your thing, that's fine, but...  This award is fantastic.  First and foremost, I want to thank God for what?  Exactly.  What did he do?  What did he do? 
[00:53:00]  There's some fucking kid with flies around his head in the Sudan.  What did he do?  And God left him alone for a few seconds.  Just long enough for a vulture to pluck his eye out.  Because, you know, he wanted to make sure your bat connected with the ball.  God's more concerned with the Bruins winning last night than gas prices.  Yeah.  How about that?  How about God work on the gas prices?  Because a lot of people are not happy.  That it continues to go up.  Yeah.  How about he works on that one?  If God really cares about sports, then God's an asshole. 
[00:53:30]  If that's what God wastes his...  If God has ever looked at a sports scoreboard, then he's a fucking dope.  And wouldn't he be a fan of one team?  Sure he would.  And they would never, ever lose?  Yeah.  Of course he would be a fan of the Angels.  Ah, I get it.  See?  See?  Hamburger!  Hamburger!  Not the Devils.  Of course not.  No!  The Devils would never win a Stanley Cup.  They'd never win.  See? 
[00:54:00]  If he was a sports fan.  Oh my God.  Is this the hackiest thing ever?  Come on now.  Chucky, ducky, ducky, quack, quack, quack.  Chucky, ducky, quack, quack.  How about this?  Athletes are just fucking annoying.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why do you put your blueberries in one at a time?  Because I'm...  It's something I learned in mind your business school.  And it's...  It's a lot of none of your concern.  These little...  These fucking blueberries have these little stems on them.  Yeah.  And, you know, if you talk less and look more, you'll learn. 
[00:54:30]  You just pull the stems off the blueberries because I don't want to chew them.  I'm not an antelope.  An antelope.  You pull the stems off your blueberries?  I dump the whole thing in without washing them?  That's what I was wondering.  He just like...  I just dump and go, man.  I like fucking...  That's how I treat you women.  Dump and go, eh?  I like fucking...  I like a clean blueberry.  And I look at every blueberry.  For a second, I drop it in.  Because I don't want to eat fucking stems or blueberries that have cancer on them.  I want a nice, healthy blueberry. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, you are very particular about what you're putting in your yogurt there.  Exactly.  I was just looking.  I didn't mean any harm by it.  I wasn't trying to be a...  Look.  What do you call a budinsky?  Look at this fucking stem.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  Who wants to eat that?  And then the whole thing, you get stem breath.  What's stem breath?  I don't want stem breath.  You two love your blueberries.  They're good.  It really is a good time of year for blueberries.  At the risk of boring everybody, myself included, this is a wonderful time for blueberries.  It's a great time of year, Ant.  Is it really?  Hey, can we get the audio of the attack in Park Slope, Brooklyn? 
[00:55:30]  That is good audio, man.  What the fuck was the neighbor doing to that?  It took him so long to leave his house.  We'll explain next, man, but...  This woman is having a tough time.  These surveillance cameras are...  I mean, the audio is great now.  Yeah, the audio is good on this one.  All right.  We have that for the show, Travis, hopefully?  Yeah, we can get it.  Yeah, we'll have that after the break.  It's a pretty good story.  And also, this is just amazing.  Steve Martin talking about bluegrass.  We have to.  We have to.  Wow.  He loves his banjo.  And Lady Gaga has to apologize for saying retard. 
[00:56:00]  So we got a busy show.  Because every fan of hers was offended.  I think we got a lot of people coming in that I don't know.  So that'll be good, too.  Who are these people?  Who are these people?  Bajorne Lomborg.  Oh, he's the Earth Day guy?  Yeah.  What?  From Cool It?  Yes.  Is he pro or against global warming?  We'll find out.  I don't know.  I don't like that tease.  I was going to watch the movie last night. 
[00:56:30]  And then I turned on that hockey game.  I'm like, fuck the radio show.  I've got to watch playoff hockey.  I was too busy at Anderson Silva's documentary.  Was it good?  Very good.  Yes.  Well, let's talk about that next.  I want to hear about it.  Yes, indeed.  Is he pro or against?  What does he think of global warming?  Does he think it's horse shite?  Because I want to be prepared.  Well, Bjorn thinks that global warming is a problem, but it's not.  How about you wait until you make a microphone?  Talk about a microphone.  Yeah, it's way better this way.  Yeah, it is true. 
[00:57:00]  Well, you asked a question.  Well, just yell it then.  Bjorn thinks that global warming is...  Yeah, you're a little too loud.  It's early.  Overmodulating.  Yeah.  Bjorn thinks that global warming is a problem, but not the problem that everybody else thinks  it is.  It's not life or death.  Oh, good.  Middle of the road, guy.  Then it's not a problem.  Well, he thinks that what we need to do to fix it is to find cost-effective ways.  Why do we have this guy in?  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:57:30]  Go fucking book this one.  Cost-effective.  I did?  Yeah.  I hate hearing it.  Cost-effective.  And Gillian Jacobs from...  I'm not the only guy in this show.  He can't blame me totally.  On that one.  I remember that when it came up, it was by the bathroom, and you're like, eh, it could  be good for...  Well, because he catches me when I have a full bladder.  I go, yes, I got to go leak. 
[00:58:00]  I'm full of bladder, too.  Oh, I thought me it meant something else.  Who's Julian Jacobs?  She's from Community.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Very funny.  Biggest show on TV.  We got to take her.  And then Clark Peters and Wendell Pierce.  From The Wire.  It's Bunk and Lester Freeman.  They have a new show on HBO called...  Trammy's about New Orleans.  Trammy, yeah.  Oh, nice.  It's done by David Simon, who did The Wire.  No shit.  Yeah, he was supposed to be here today, but he's got something else.  Can you imagine?  That would be...  I would like to talk to him.  He was a reporter.  The guy that fucking came up with The Wire? 
[00:58:30]  He created or produced or what?  Everything.  He created it.  Holy shit.  I want to talk to that guy.  Yeah.  He's busy.  All right.  We'll break.  Yes.  Let's do that.  The Virus.  Get in touch with the Opie and Anthony Show.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  Send your feedback to feedback at opieandanthony.com.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:59:00]  A lot of people commenting on Kim Norton pulling the stems off the blueberries.  Oh.  The blueberries.  What could they possibly be commenting on about that?  Well, Jordan, who's a fine, fine listener, a regular to the Instant Feedback, he writes,  I love Jimmy.  He picks the stems off of blueberries, but has hooker piss in his mouth.  There are inconsistencies.  Jimmy has always said, don't look for consistencies in this life. 
[00:59:30]  It just doesn't make sense.  I know.  I eat the fucking stems.  No problem.  I just saw Rob Bartlett on the commercial for the play there that he's on in Broadway.  He had fire from that.  With Harry Potter.  Yeah, he did.  Did he?  Yeah.  No.  It was an incident backstage with somebody.  With Danny Radcliffe?  Yeah.  Oh, Larry Ketzen that?  Yeah.  John Larry Ketzen.  Oh, the fucking funniest guy in stripes.  I'd love to get a fucking...  Shut up.  Shut up.  You're still obsessed with stripes.  Love them.  A little bit.  A little bit, a little bit.  A little bit, a little bit. 
[01:00:00]  You know, we've been trashed in Canada once in a while and people get mad.  Do they?  Oh, Canada.  Could you sing it?  Oh, Canada.  And remember we had the comedian on who fucking...  He had the Human Rights Tribunal because he had something called the dykes?  Yeah.  Well, in Canada, he has been ordered to pay $15,000.  Good.  Oh, I mean the bad.  And here's what it was.  To Lorna party, he has ordered to pay for injury to dignity, feelings, and self-respect. 
[01:00:30]  Very injured.  What?  Bring us back.  He was doing his act in Canada.  He was an emcee.  Right.  And I guess...  I vaguely remember this guy.  It's been a while.  Yeah.  Her and her girlfriend were drinking on the patio and they were told that they can't  drink on the patio outdoors after 11 at this establishment.  Maybe it's the rules of the law.  I don't know.  So they come inside.  I guess they're heckling.  And it's said that they were...  Let me see here.  A group of three women were told by the staff they had to come inside. 
[01:01:00]  And there was a...  He was hosting this open mic night.  After a few heckles were reportedly hurled from where the women were sitting, he retaliated  retaliated from the stage, which was responded to with a display of smooching between party  and her then-girlfriend.  So they start making out.  So he admits calling them fat and ugly among much cruder epithets.  And the exchange was followed by a physical thing, which Earl broke party sunglasses, although 
[01:01:30]  he later offered to pay the replacement.  All right.  Now, that's a problem.  Well...  But you can't do anything physical with an audience.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Although I don't know whose fault it was.  Like, who...  Mm-hmm.  Oh, the zentite.  That got me laughing, too, dude.  What was that one about?  I just had a sneeze.  I was like...  Oh, it was a...  True.  It was a cartoon sneeze.  The tribunal...  The fucking... 
[01:02:00]  A tribunal.  Pukey, fucking liberal fucking words.  It's a...  Imagine if he had insulted Catholicism, and there was just kind of a witch hunt.  Can you imagine the fucking...  I mean, there's been an outcry, but the outcry...  How could you allow that?  The tribunal ruled the harassment of party was both verbal and physical, and involved  both aggressiveness and physical contact, which gave merit to her claim of having suffered  post-traumatic stress disorder. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, man.  You know what?  Go to a military hospital, you fucking cunt.  You heckling cunt.  And see people that really have post-traumatic stress disorder.  Shut up.  Yeah, yeah.  They throw that around a little too easily.  You are fat and ugly.  I don't know what she looks like.  But, um...  What a fucking vomit-inducing story.  The Human Rights Tribunal is fucking despicable.  But that's what it is.  That's what it's comfortable.  Sometimes you gotta appreciate...  People ask why I never go up there to perform.  That's why. 
[01:03:00]  You gotta appreciate this country sometimes.  You know, the First Amendment.  Good one.  They don't have...  I mean, do they have a First Amendment?  They have some type of constitution.  I don't even know what's in it.  It's probably hockey rules.  It's a little different up there.  Crazy people up there.  Crazy people.  That's enraging.  They gave us a speech when we started on XM Canada.  You gotta be a little careful up here.  It's a little different.  No, you don't.  Well, I know.  So they handle it.  I did Montreal.  It was okay.  It was okay.  Yeah?  Yes.  I like the Montreal Comedy Festival.  Just because all you guys were up there performing at the same time. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, I did all right.  It was a blast.  I enjoyed it.  Might as well continue with this subject, because now we got Lady Gaga.  Lady Gaga.  What is she up to?  At least the paper writes it this way.  You knew it was coming just a day after Lady Gaga used the word retarded to dismiss speculation  that her song Born This Way rips off Madonna's Express Yourself.  She has apologized to all the retards.  Apologized?  Oh, I mean, she has apologized for her phrasing. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, I was wondering if they wrote it that way.  Wow, I saw that differently.  Yeah.  In a statement to gossip blogger Perez Dickhead, Gaga said, I consider it part of my life's  work in music to push the boundaries of love and acceptance.  Be retarded.  My apologies for not speaking thoughtfully.  To anyone that was hurt, please know that it was furiously unintentional.  An honest mistake requires honesty to make.  What a fucking cop-out.  The people that are hurt don't even know.  Is she apologizing, by the way, for the fucking people who are offended by her religious thing? 
[01:04:30]  Why is she not apologizing for that?  Right.  You fucking PC, big clitted idiot.  I think all should be allowed, but that would seem worse.  Yeah.  Making fun of someone's religion than just using a word and not in the context of hate speech.  Well, that's the sacred cow of today.  It's the retarded people.  It's not their religion, so you don't have to apologize for that.  Why couldn't she say I'm being an artist and expressing myself when I said retarded? 
[01:05:00]  Because I felt that...  She should have fucking stood strong on us.  Come on, Maverick.  Because people do say retarded.  When we were growing up and we said, stop being a retard, I never thought of waterheads  when I said it.  Yeah.  I just didn't.  And when you called someone a fag growing up, I didn't even know what gay was yet.  Yeah.  I didn't know.  It's just words you use.  Words you just use.  And you're not thinking, like, of the deeper fucking meaning of the whole goddamn thing.  Yeah, I was walking to Ray's Pizza yesterday. 
[01:05:30]  Ray's original or famous Ray's?  I was walking to Ray's Pizza.  There's only one, man.  Well, it was in Times Square.  Oh, they have 10 in Times Square alone, I think.  I know.  I was walking over there, and there were three black guys in front of the pizza place.  And in the time it took me to walk past them, I heard nigga probably 10 times.  That's exactly what I said the other day?  Just bam, bam, bam, back and forth, and this nigga, that nigga, that.  And I'm just sitting there going, what the fuck? 
[01:06:00]  Fuck you.  I'm thinking to myself, fuck you.  I'll say whatever I want whenever I want to say it.  You should have said it out loud right there.  I really, you know something?  I really wanted to, and I was fully prepared to, but I needed my pizza, and I needed to  eat it through a jaw that wasn't wired shut.  So I figured I'd shut my mouth.  I would love to see your pizza blended up for you.  Yeah, yeah.  And I'm drinking my pizza through the straw.  God, how great would that be? 
[01:06:30]  Is my pizza almost ready?  Yeah.  You should have seen the other guy.  There were crooked cops who heard me say nigger, and they got what was coming to them, which  was broken fists from my jaw.  It's beyond me, because it's so accepted, and it isn't the exception to the rule, from  what I see.  It's the fucking rule.  Yeah, all words should be said.  Just stop.  Enough, right?  The name of the song is Judas, right?  Yeah, Judas is the latest one by Lady Gaga. 
[01:07:00]  That's got everyone talking.  Lady Gaga.  So I guess she was being interviewed about her hit song and her songwriting abilities, so  she defended that by saying, why would I try to put out a song and think I'm getting one  over on everybody, she said.  That's retarded.  That's how she used it.  That's retarded.  We've all used it that way.  Yes.  Without thinking of someone with lesser fucking mental abilities.  With mental, mentally, you can't even say that. 
[01:07:30]  What is the appropriate word for a retard these days?  Mentally challenged.  Mentally challenged.  But then that's saying they're different.  Why is that okay?  Yeah.  Because the genius of Carlin, who came up with the idea, there are more syllables to  it, and you've removed the humanity.  Mentally challenged.  And again, as George said, we think that by changing the language, we change the condition.  Right.  We don't.  No, of course not.  That's a great thing to remember.  A paint chip eater by any other name.  Because what will happen, mentally challenged will become the thing that everyone is offended 
[01:08:00]  by eventually.  Not right away.  Yeah.  You fast forward, I don't know, a bunch of years, all of a sudden they're going to be  outraged when you say mentally challenged.  Yeah.  That's how it works.  It's retarded.  It is retarded.  I'll tell you.  And I would bet money, people listening right now that have a kid that's mentally fucking  challenged, say retarded. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  Not to their kid, though.  When they're in everyday situations, maybe they look at a coworker or something and go,  oh, that's retarded.  It's language.  And they got someone at home that's mentally challenged.  When was the last time you watched, and the movie is just plodding and slow and oh, but  when was the last time you watched-  Bridges of Massie County?  Yeah, that one.  Oh my God, it's terrific.  1984.  I saw that in 82.  You know what?  Did you?  Was it out in 82? 
[01:09:00]  You ready for this?  I don't even know.  I think it was.  I've never seen the movie, but I'll tell you this.  I read the book every, probably every five years.  What's a book?  1984, the book is fucking terrific, man.  I didn't mind the movie.  See, I just never seen it.  Who's in it, even?  That guy that was in Alien, the guy that got the thing burst out of his chest there.  Yeah.  He's a Hurt.  His last name is Hurt, but is he John Hurt, or is he another Hurt?  I don't know.  You're right.  Yeah?  John Hurt?  John Hurt was in 1984? 
[01:09:30]  I think he was, right?  I think he's a great fucking actor, by the way.  John Hurt.  Yeah, he's been in a lot of shit.  He plays a lot of weird shit.  Oh, yeah.  He does a lot of weird shit.  He's a weirdo.  He's a weirdo.  But no, I liked it.  But when you watch it, it's like, and you don't want to sound like, you big brother, this,  your baby.  But there are some things in there that you're like, wow, that really did come to pass.  And the whole thing with words and having to change things to make them sound better, and 
[01:10:00]  it's just that has completely happened.  We've fallen into that.  You can't get a straight answer from a politician.  You're crucified, if you use a word like retard.  It's gotten way out of hand.  Apologies every day, which mean nothing.  The more apologies you hear, the less any apology means.  So why are you forcing people to apologize when, first of all, they don't mean it, and 
[01:10:30]  secondly, it takes the meaning away from sincere apologies, which I think I've yet to hear.  I don't know.  You don't know anymore.  I don't.  I have no idea.  That's a great point.  You don't even know anymore what is a real apology.  Yeah.  Because it's been so watered down.  Just someone protecting their own ass.  Sure it is.  And I hate the other one where they go, I take full responsibility.  What does that mean?  I take full responsibility.  Oh, okay.  Well, great.  What does that mean?  There should be a punishment if you say that.  Fucking savages.  God, just fucking behave.  Blacks, right? 
[01:11:00]  For fuck's sake.  78-year-old mugged on Arthur Avenue in the Bronx, of course.  Well, why is she living there?  I don't know.  She's probably been there before.  I guess she's got...  Grab the pocketbook.  Like, look, just some old...  And some fucking...  Some animal with a fucking hoodie on and just runs away with a...  God, it's just predatorial.  Stop it!  But the, uh...  What were we saying?  I don't disagree.  The fucking speech.  No, no, no, no, no.  About, uh...  Oh, the, uh...  I take full responsibility? 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  I hate that.  Because it doesn't mean anything.  You should apologize when you say...  We've all said things that you feel...  Like, especially arguing with a chick or whatever.  Where you say things that you feel...  I've said things publicly that I was like, ah...  I felt a little rough about that one.  Like, I felt kind of bad.  And I haven't apologized for it, but it's like, that's what you should apologize for.  If you say something, you feel bad about it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  If you honestly feel bad about it.  Or if you hurt someone's feelings and you genuinely feel bad.  Like, oh, shit, I didn't mean to hurt that person's feelings.  I'm sorry.  But I like Anne's point.  You don't know the difference anymore because you hear... 
[01:12:00]  Of course.  I apologize so much.  It's watered down where you really don't know if the person even means it anymore.  I'm sorry for...  I like that angle.  And then whatever it is means nothing now.  Right.  Especially...  You know, in your personal life, it might.  I don't know.  But in the public eye, when a celebrity, sports figure, whatever, has to apologize...  Right.  To me, it never means...  It's never sincere.  At this point, no, it's not.  It's covering your ass.  Because you don't...  You never see anyone apologize unless there's some type of outrage where they have to come forward. 
[01:12:30]  They never say...  Like, if no one mentioned that she said retard and was outraged by it...  Right.  Do you think the next day she would have went, look, yesterday...  Oh, I thought about it.  By the way, let me bring this up.  Yeah.  Yesterday, I said retard.  And I want to apologize for that.  No one said anything.  Right.  But let me just say, because I slept.  I thought about it.  I realized it was the wrong thing to say.  Yeah, yeah.  It never happens.  It's always because someone points out what you said.  It's got to be dragged out of you.  And to me, that's not sincere.  That's all bullshit.  Yep.  Lady Gaga is all bullshit, too, by the way. 
[01:13:00]  Lady Gaga.  It's a gimmick.  Sorry to break that to you, but she's all bullshit.  It's a gimmick.  She's very talented, but she's all bullshit.  Yeah, I like her.  I mean, I love her tunes.  I like her music a lot.  She's not really outrageous.  Sounds like a number one hit tune.  Mm-hmm.  Poppy.  She was apologizing because it hurt Perez Hilton's feelings.  Oh, shut up.  Well, it should have.  Yeah, exactly.  The guy who used to draw cum bubbles and then comes clean on that, and all of a sudden,  he's like the goody two-shoes guy.  Go fuck yourself. 
[01:13:30]  You know what you are, Perez Hilton.  Goody light loafers, maybe.  Ha ha.  Get it?  Okay.  And he changed his shit because his livelihood was at stake.  Yeah.  He still wants to be drawing cum bubbles.  Yeah.  People came after him.  And the big fucking cartoon cocks.  He came out as...  The reason he fucking did that was because he was so called out.  On his hypocrisy.  He was so...  That would literally be like me criticizing someone who got a prostitute.  Publicly.  For real.  Right.  That person should be fired for getting a hooker. 
[01:14:00]  Right.  You've gotten a lot.  I apologize.  Sorry.  Mm-hmm.  He's a fucking despicable...  Yeah.  ...fucking ex-fat phony who's trying to be like this cute...  And it's amazing the shit he's gotten away with.  Uh-huh.  Like the fucking...  Miss America Broad says something, you know, about she doesn't like gay marriage.  And she's vilified as the antichrist.  He's been drawing cum on people's faces, outing people for all these years.  And fucking there's not...  There's no penalty for him at all.  Yeah.  Of course not.  And now he changes his tune and he's goody two-shoes.  Right.  And everyone just bought into it.  Yeah. 
[01:14:30]  He stinks.  This guy wants to be drawing cum.  He stinks.  That's all he wants.  He loves to draw fucking cum and dick.  Cum and cocks and nose dripping because the actress did too much fucking coke the night  before.  He desperately wants to continue with that shit.  But man, no one will fucking say that either.  No.  He's like this...  I don't know.  He's beloved now because...  Because of why?  Um...  I don't know.  Because he's gay.  Because there are a bunch of phonies to begin with out there.  He gets away with more in Hollywood.  Who knows?  All right. 
[01:15:00]  Hey, uh...  We had an attacker in, uh...  Where was that?  Park Slope?  Park Slope, uh...  Brooklyn.  Is that a good area?  It's not a bad area.  Is that where you used to...  No.  I used to go there.  Weren't you close to there?  Yeah.  I was kind of close to there.  You know, it's Brooklyn.  But, uh...  Well, Brooklyn's pretty fucking big, though.  Yeah.  True.  I was, uh...  Yeah, one place I lived in Brooklyn was pretty close to there.  And I knew some people there.  But, uh...  It's not that bad an area. 
[01:15:30]  But, uh...  Wow.  Some Hispanic guy.  He goes up to this, uh...  Looked like a white broad.  Mm-hmm.  And just starts accosting her on the street.  And there's a security camera on this guy's house facing his front gate.  And you can see the sidewalk and the cars and the street.  And it picked up the sound and the, uh...  Video of this, uh...  Gentleman accosting this woman.  I don't know what he was trying to get from her.  A purse?  Or it looked like he was trying to stick his hand up her skirt.  I couldn't tell what the fuck was happening.  I think he was going for her meat purse. 
[01:16:00]  You think?  The meat purse?  Yeah.  He was going for the contents of her meat purse.  Yeah, he was going for the meat purse.  Because it did look like he's grabbing her.  Uh...  At first, all you hear is her screaming.  And then, uh...  They come into frame.  And then it takes forever for the homeowner, who has this camera, to come out and...  Yeah, what a lazy...  And shake his fist and, hey, you, what are you doing?  What a lazy fuck.  Yeah.  You'll hear the neighbor eventually.  But here's the audio.  It's crystal clear, which is just amazing.  Oh, yeah, she's screaming.  Right off the sidewalk, right in front of this guy's house. 
[01:16:30]  Advertise me.  Your video will resume shortly.  Chicken salad sandwich for...  Oh, God.  Oh, yes.  Yeah.  The ads.  Oh, my God.  It's driving me nuts.  It's a whole new world on the Internet.  But why can't...  I would rather than just put the fucking McDonald's logo, whatever the fuck, right on the screen.  So you don't have to sit through this shit.  There it is.  Don'toperate me.  Oh, my God. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, my God.  Get out of me!  Get out of me!  Get out of me!  Hey, what's going on?  After he gets away.  Hey, what's going on, finally? 
[01:17:30]  Fucking, that's fucking disgusting.  Did you see, it's, what is it, April?  That guy still has his Christmas lights out?  I know, I saw that.  That is terrible.  That guy's got his Christmas lights out.  Do you know how panic-stricken that attacker must have been on that quiet block when she's screaming her head off?  It looks like she gave him a nut shot, because he started kind of limping.  He let go of her, it looked like, before the guy, yeah, she might have gotten a shot in there.  But that's something that happens all the time, that you don't get to see this intimately. 
[01:18:00]  That is a fucking brutal attack happening.  That's very primal, very fucking jungle, very animalistic.  You know, when you watch a fucking lioness just laying her fangs into the throat of a gazelle,  that's what that shit is right there.  It's an attack, it's brutal.  You motherfuckers.  And the people get away with it all the time.  You know, you don't get to see it on camera like that, and hear that horror.  The guy got away too, right? 
[01:18:30]  Hispanic?  Of course, he'll just run into the crowd of fucking degenerates, lose himself in the crowd of fucking animals.  I'm so sick of these fucking people.  Christ on a pony.  God, would it be great to just burst out that door and blast his fucking head off?  Then you'd go to jail, by the way.  Yeah.  It would be wonderful.  Great legal system we got.  Whatever.  I'm just tired of it.  And you see so much of it now because, you know, cameras are everywhere. 
[01:19:00]  They showed a guy being shot the other day on TV.  Well, you see, yeah.  You see an African-American gentleman walks up.  He's got a hoodie on and just sticks his arm straight out and pop, pop, pop.  Just fucking kill somebody.  It's infuriating.  I don't know what he's going for there.  I'm watching the video.  He's like, he really is just trying to, like, feel her tits or something.  Yeah, I think, well, because he's wearing, like, baggy pants, and they're kind of falling down. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, right.  But I can't tell.  How do you stick your dick in something moving like that?  It's like a rodeo rider.  Oh, Jesus.  It looks like he was kind of, because he's not facing the camera, and it almost looks like he was playing with her.  Oh, he might have, like, been groping her and trying to jack off.  And it almost looks like that's why she gets away, because he's too busy with himself.  And then she kind of gets away from him.  Wow.  And then that's when he has to pull his pants up and fucking run away.  He has a very low amperage breaker. 
[01:20:00]  I mean, see, his pants are, like, half down.  Oh, yeah, look.  They're kind of half down.  He's trying to, like, do something.  I think he's jacking off.  Yeah, right?  And he's pulling her toward his dick.  Holy shit.  And then she runs away.  I think you're right.  And then he pulls his pants up.  Holy fuck.  He had his pants down.  Oh, my God.  Dude, he had his pants down.  He was trying to sexually abuse that woman.  He was jacking.  That's the perv switch right there, because it's not even a dark area.  That's crazy.  You just walk down the street and you're like, ah, I just got to pull my dick out and rub  it against somebody. 
[01:20:30]  Whether they want it or not.  Holy shit.  You ever watch, you ever read Brave New World?  That's another really good one.  No.  Good one?  Oh, yeah.  Good one.  Yeah.  I don't like books.  You don't like books?  I don't like the books.  I like books.  I just don't read them as much as I should.  And then I start reading.  And I go, wow, I like reading.  Yeah, you know, it's...  I don't know why.  You know, it's fucked up.  And this just shows what a fucking piece of shit I am.  I was sitting on the couch reading the other day, and my girl looks at me and just goes, 
[01:21:00]  that just doesn't look right.  Oh, really?  Yeah, me reading.  So what were you reading?  I was like, oh, good.  Mein Kampf.  I know that would look right.  I was actually reading my new edition of American Rifleman magazine.  There you are.  You were reading Highlights magazine.  She's like, why do you have a tent under the afghan?  And you're like, well, Goofus has been very bad.  Yes.  And Gallant is scolding him by placing his asshole on Goofus' mouth. 
[01:21:30]  I hated Goofus and Gallant.  I loved those, Gallant.  They were crazy.  Hey, uh...  Like a Mr. Bungle.  Now that we did that story serious, now we've got to get silly, I'm thinking.  Yeah, yeah, a little silly.  Let's start with Tim in Rhode Island.  Tim, can you get that audio back?  All right.  You should play the Price is Right music behind that, because she's screaming like she won  the showcase showdown.  Oh my God, do we have the Price is Right music?  This is not right.  I've got to say, we could put this screaming to something and see if it's not as horrific  as it is.  Well, we'd like to do this. 
[01:22:00]  Because, you know, people are very bothered now.  Right, right.  I'll add Benny Hill to the list right off the bat.  It leaves me with a weird feeling of victimization.  What do we need?  Let's try a few of these.  Price is Right?  Price is Right.  I want Benny Hill.  Anyone else have one or two?  When do you usually hear screaming?  Maybe, Eric, if you could find a good horror movie soundtrack.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah, yeah.  Some strings with some accents.  I'm thinking a John Sterling home run call myself.  Oh, wow. 
[01:22:30]  She's a very excited Yankee fan.  Very excited Yankee fan.  What do you got?  Let's start this.  Georgie juices one.  I think Georgie was juicing one on her fucking skirt.  All right, here's the first one.  Let's try this.  See?  Come on.  Here we go.  Oh, calm down. 
[01:23:00]  Come on up.  Come on up.  You're the next contestant on The Price is Right.  You can win a new car.  Bob Barker's trying to wipe pre-cum on her fur coat.  Tim in Rhode Island, I'm giving you listener of the day.  Enjoy that award today.  That's a good one. 
[01:23:30]  I got one if Danny would start up the music.  I'm going to start up the screen.  You ready?  Wait, I got to make sure I'm ready.  It's this one, right?  Yeah, yeah, go ahead.  Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.  Oh, the choreo.  That's how I redo it.  That's better. 
[01:24:00]  That's a terrible thing that almost happens.  Yes, yes.  But it really just goes to show you how great Shelly Long is in The Shining.  She's way more terrified in that movie than this woman is for potentially being raised.  This woman doesn't have Kubrick yelling at her. 
[01:24:30]  She's had some fucking drunken guy from Howard Beach with a six-inch dick.  Oh, that is a good one.  Porn music is coming in.  Maybe some porn music.  Live Michael Jackson.  Do we have any other ones?  I like that.  Larry King.  Larry King wants to know what she did with the groceries. 
[01:25:00]  Was the assailant wearing an Adidas sweatsuit or did it appear to be a knockoff?  Holy Jesus.  We got any more?  Benny Hill would be.  That's too easy.  Hello, Benny Hill.  Jim, what's the music from Clockwork Orange when they're in the house attacking the lady?  Do you know that?  Yes, I do.  Is it the William Tell or is it the, uh, is it something else?  Uh, the William Tell is when he's fucking the two girls.  Yeah.  Um, I don't remember which, uh, I'm thinking right now. 
[01:25:30]  You could try the William Tell, but the William Tell is also when they, uh, no, that's when  he's fucking the two girls.  Yeah, yeah.  I think it's just with Singing in the Rain.  Singing in the Rain.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  That is terrific.  I don't know.  I think we did it.  Yeah, that was good.  Yeah.  Wait, maybe you could put, like, bombs and stuff with rocks going through the windows.  I don't know.  For the screams? 
[01:26:00]  I don't think so, Chip.  Oh.  Do we have any live Beatles?  Oh, shit.  Can we try it?  Yeah, yeah.  Beatles from, uh.  You can play Love Me Do.  Like Shea Stadium or the Hollywood Bowl or something.  You got a live Beatles song?  Ed Sullivan.  All right.  Uh, Shinebox gets the credit for that one.  Shinebox.  Mm.  Mm.  Mm.  Mm.  Mm.  You got that?  I'm looking for live.  It's all the remastered stuff.  E-Rock looking intently.  Well, if you just play one, you might be able to. 
[01:26:30]  That's true.  It's all right.  It'll still be funny in a minute later.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's see if the live works.  Why don't you shave, E-Rock?  You should be writing all work and no play.  No, wait.  All eat and no work makes Eric a dull boy.  Ernest Hammingway.  And we're off.  And we're off.  And we're off, he says.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[01:27:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I wish I read so I would know all this.  Believe me.  I'm just trying to think of how can I make Stephen King fat.  That's like the only song I can think about.  Oh, my fucking God.  I would find that fucking Beatles song really fast if I was you.  E-Rock.  Yeah, right.  Oh, cocksucker.  Because everyone's just ready to bounce.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, two or other authors.  It's just a matter of. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, the bearded author is good.  It's very difficult.  See, reading fucked us today.  Wait a minute.  We didn't fuck us today.  See?  See?  See?  I don't know.  We made fun of the reading thing and now it fucking haunts us.  Oh, wait.  James French Fries.  Get it.  He just goes, get it.  Get it.  Get it.  Mayo Angelou.  That's a good one.  I think he had a beard, but it doesn't matter. 
[01:28:00]  It's all things.  Yeah, we blow off the beard part.  That's a good one.  Oh.  Oh, for Pete's sake.  Oh, yeah.  That's, um...  God, it's tough because we're not really smart.  Hey, I don't even have to change this one.  Sir Francis Bacon.  I left my computer at the hotel, so I don't even get the input from the PT people.  Yeah.  How was it?  I was great.  Oh, okay.  Good time.  Definitely fun. 
[01:28:30]  Where were you?  I was, uh...  What?  You did a whole thing on that.  What?  No, I didn't do a whole thing.  I did real quick.  Can I try one more?  No.  Yeah, yeah.  It's probably not a bomb ad, but I'll try it anyway.  Truman Chipotle?  Chipotle.  Truman Chipotle.  I got one.  Oh, what, Chip?  Stephen King appetizes.

[01:43:00]  I was showing  Jimmy and Anthony  My latest video  On my YouTube channel  Opie Radio  And me and Roland  Were walking around  Yesterday  And I  I'm going to break  Down all the walls  Because it gets weird  Now  I saw a woman  An old woman  At a bus stop  Yeah  And I went  Wow that looks like  Barbra Streisand  Yeah  I think I can make  A dumb little video  That a few thousand  People would see  Whatever  So I go up to her  And I go  You know  Are you Barbra Streisand  Or something like that  As a goof 
[01:43:30]  Knowing that it was  A lookalike  And I filmed her  For about a minute  I was harassing her  And blah blah blah  And she's like  No no no  And she walks away  And then I upload  The video going  Man I think  A lot of people  Are going to really  Believe this is  Barbra Streisand  And I'm laughing  Because I'm thinking  It's got to be  A lookalike  I just showed  Jimmy and Ant  And unless  They're bullshitting me  No  They think it really  Is Barbra Streisand  100%  100%  I know for a fact  That's Barbra Streisand  You got Barbra Streisand  On your camera yesterday  That is absolutely  Well she wasn't  Waiting for the bus  Because she walked away  She's wearing 
[01:44:00]  Here's the thing  Because we did  Freeze frame  And one of the  Guys that follows me  On twitter  Freeze framed it  With some old  Barbra Streisand  Pictures  And it looks  Really similar  She has these weird  The lines around her  Mouth  Like the way the lines  Undergo from the nose  To the mouth  The glasses  And she's wearing  A giant hat  The lips  And the way  The chin is  And that hat  She's hiding  Under that fucking hat  Big floppy  Fucking titanic hat  It's a big giant  Puffy pink coat  With fur on the back  And it was warm yesterday  And it was warm 
[01:44:30]  And that giant hat  Is meant to conceal her face  And let's be honest  That schnoz  She needs a big hat  Yeah  I could usually read you guys  Are you fucking with me?  I would love to make a fool  Because I walked away laughing  Like this is a lookalike  And I think people are going to believe  It's Barbra Streisand  Now you're telling me  It is Barbra Streisand  Why would she  She ran away like that  And walked away  Play the video real quick  And then we'll bring in  I want to ask the guest  What he thinks  Because I guarantee you  That's her  I'll retweet it  In a minute or two  Or if you want to  It's only a one minute video  Go to my 
[01:45:00]  Just listen to Twitter  Just our luck  I think Barbra Streisand  Is standing right over there  Waiting for a city bus  Huh?  Yes  Wait  Now I'm going to walk up to her  She wasn't waiting for her  She wasn't waiting for the bus  She's just standing against the wall  She's waiting for somebody  Why would she just be standing like that  Are you Barbra Streisand?  No, I'm not  And then she walks away quickly  No, I'm not  Barbra Streisand  She doesn't want to be Barbra  Did I just get your autograph?  That's so her  And then she walks back the same way  Yeah, she just keeps trying to walk away 
[01:45:30]  From my camera  Where's Barbra Streisand?  Does this make you nervous?  That's not my kid, by the way  People are wondering  That's  And now I'm just  And here she comes again  Walking by the camera  Big fan, Barbara  Big fan  And look, the way she's looking away  Big fan, Barbara  A civilian doesn't walk like that  Absolutely, that's her  You got her  Are you kidding me?  You so nailed Barbra Streisand  She does not want to be recognized  Because  You got Barbra Streisand  And my video's weird now, by the way  If you're a fan of my dumb videos  And you got Barbra Streisand  She's freeze-framing that 
[01:46:00]  So when  That's her  And we compared it to somebody else  You know how fucking weird this is  Because I film this whole thing  Going, holy shit  This lookalike is going to make people think  It's Barbra Streisand  I'll put it up on my dumb channel  It is her  But now you're telling me  It really is her  So now the joke's on me  Because I'm laughing the whole time  Like, oh god  Who's going to believe  In the end  This is really Barbra Streisand  Because you had a camera  It is absolutely her  If you would have walked up to her alone  And just said  Hey, Barbara  I love your stuff  She would have probably said hi to you  Right 
[01:46:30]  But because you had a camera  What if it was just some weirdo  And saw the camera  No, it's her  It's her  It's absolutely her  Do you see the way she walked away?  Like, people don't do that  Like, regular people  That aren't used to walking away  From people with cameras  Don't walk away like that  She was not  She wasn't looking into the camera  She had no makeup on  Like, anybody else  Would have been looking at you  Going, what are you doing?  You guys are in cahoots together today  No, I swear  Can we bring in Bjorn?  Let a fresh mind look at it  And say, is that her or look good?  Roland, you thought that was Barbra Streisand?  I guarantee that's her 
[01:47:00]  You didn't think it was Barbra Streisand  Hey, Bjorn, what's up?  Bjorn, how do you say your name, man?  Lomborg, not Borg  That's good  Lomborg?  Yes, sir  How are you?  Pleasure  Now, have you heard the controversy  We're having right now?  I just heard it  Okay  I'm not sure I know her well enough to tell  But look, everyone knows what  I think he nailed Barbra Streisand right there  He thought it was a look like  That is absolutely her  Come on  Honestly?  Yeah  I think you got her  Not even think  I am 100% sure that's her  You're not 100% sure?  No  Let's go 
[01:47:30]  Okay, put her up next to  Put it up next to a picture of Barbra Streisand  Well, here, I got that  Ulp has a mock-up  Do you have it on the computer screen?  Travis, look her up  Hold on, I'll do  What else are we going to do today?  Might as well  We're going to talk about coolant in a second, sir  You want to smell very good  Don't you worry  Here  This guy  It's her  Look at the chin  Look at the line under her fucking chair  I'm cursing  This guy put it all together  And tweeted it to me yesterday  That is  Look  That is absolutely 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, look  Look  Look  Look at the shape of the face  The line under the chin  She's not made up or anything  If I really had Barbra  The only question is  Am I going to get a much harder time  If I say it's not her?  No  Not at all  In that case  I don't think it is  He doesn't think it is?  You know, why not?  I thought it was just a look-alike  Yeah  What makes you think it's not her?  The way she walks around, though  That's very  I think she might be just  A nutty lady or something  No, I think that's very celebrity  You don't think it's her? 
[01:48:30]  Nah  What do you think, Jimmy?  I'm 100% sure  I'm 100% sure  I'm so mad  I would have done some other shit  Because, again  Fuck  She has  You had one of the A-listers  Right in front of you  And I didn't do shit with it  Well, you did  No, I would have  Wait, I would have slapped her  The only  Oh  You have to, right?  That's probably why she walked away  Yeah  She can see that coming  You don't think so, Kenny?  No  Kenny doesn't think it's her  Well, I'll send it to TMZ  If they play it  Then that means it was her 
[01:49:00]  Wait a minute  Oh, oh  Oh, now  Certain things can't be changed  Like the size  See, she has a big  Nose  Square face  Nose  You're studying the pictures, Jimmy?  Of course I am  It's what I do  Jimmy's good at this stuff  There's weird shadowing going on in there  That's not a good example  See, because you're looking at her  In Opie's video  I think we need to go forward  A couple of frames  It's her with absolutely no makeup  Yes  So, and a hat  A big floppy hat 
[01:49:30]  And it was  It wasn't a big  So she looks a little older  In Opie's picture  Can you go forward a couple of frames  On that video?  Sure  Is that possible?  Wow, she turns her head really quickly  Yeah, I barely got her on film  That which makes it even  Right there  Okay  More controversial  Zoom in on that  Screen cap it  I'm sorry  The thing is  It ties in perfectly  It was too warm yesterday  Ah, see  It could be  Smart  It could have something to do  Perhaps she is  Rebellying against the idea  Of global warming 
[01:50:00]  Right  By dressing like it's  She's dressed like it's 11 degrees out  A psychopath or a celebrity  Would dress like that  A lot of people  Checking in saying it's so her  It's absolutely her  Which means the joke's on me  Because I put the whole video up  Going  I think I could trick some people  Into thinking  And I just filmed  Fucking Barbra Streisand  And now people are saying  It's Barbra Streisand  So I'm the idiot  Under the chin  Is what's convincing me  That it hurts  Not the other stuff  The lines around the mouth  And under the chin  The fucking line  Under the chin  Is too long  And the lips are  Exactly  Exactly 
[01:50:30]  And the lips  Yeah, which I would love to kiss  Ew  You wouldn't let  Fucking  Would you?  I would with her  Although I'm thinking  It's very optimistic  To say there are certain things  You can't change  Isn't that the whole thing  About Hollywood?  Yeah  Well, yeah  We love Hollywood  The brow line  Everything  It's her  Sorry you had to come in  In the middle of this  Oh, hey  He thought he just found  A lookalike  And we think it's great  That he got one of the biggest  Celebrities in Hollywood  Ever  Yeah  Didn't even know  And because she walked away  Because he had a camera  And she knows she looks awful  I want to thank you guys  Because you guys just 
[01:51:00]  Fucking made this video  Become a hit  Yeah  I mean  I'm  But then again  All you do is really have  All you have is a video  Of Barbra Streisand  Going no and walking  Yeah  I mean in this day and age  No one's really gonna  Yeah, you don't really have  It's not like you caught her  Like, hey, look  That lady's blowing  A homeless guy  People are gonna now  Check the video out  I just retweeted it  So, OP Radio on Twitter  You tell me if that's  Fucking Barbra Streisand  Yes  Which would mean that  Like I said again  I'll say it again  The joke's on me  Because I really thought  It was just a lookalike  Let's just cool it though  We can move on  Ah, cool it 
[01:51:30]  Ah, tying it in  You guys just say that  It's the  It's a  You're doing something  On global warming  And I didn't watch  The documentary  Honestly  I'm an ass  Because I went to see  Anderson Silva's thing  Yesterday  And I just didn't plan  On doing that  I just happened to  Find out that it was playing  An hour and a half  Before it was playing  So, what is the controversy  About your documentary  Because there is a controversy  Absolutely there is  I mean  The fundamental point  That I try to bring along  Is to get people to realize  We've been told that  Global warming is this  All-ending catastrophe  And we need to recognize 
[01:52:00]  Global warming is a problem  It's something we need to deal with  And Earth Day is a good time  To talk about it  But the way that we're  Scaring people senseless  Doesn't work  Partly because it's not true  But also partly because  We don't make good decisions  When we're scared  So, you know  Let's start talking about  What would actually work  Instead of just having  All this, you know  Feel-good measures  Where you put up  A few solar panels  You feel like  Oh, I've saved the world  Where in fact  You've done  Virtually nothing  At very high  Subsidized cost  So, now Letterman 
[01:52:30]  Had you on  Yep  And what was his take on  Meaning  Did he  Was he  Confrontational with you  Or did he actually  Think that you were right  He's hard to get a read on  But I actually thought  He definitely watched the film  And he liked a lot of it  I think he's  He's sort of  And I think that's  How many people are  Can this really be true?  Can all of the stuff  That I've heard from Al Gore  And everybody else  You know, the world  Is coming to an end  Yeah  Can that really not be  The whole truth?  But the honest answer is 
[01:53:00]  You know, Al Gore told us  A story that was intended  To get our attention  And so he ramped it up  A little bit  He told us about  20 feet of sea level rise  You know, flooding  Oh, I know  Yeah, I couldn't believe that  And that's just not  That's not what  The UN Climate Panel  Is telling us  They're saying, you know  Somewhere between  Half and two feet  About one foot  Of sea level rise  That's a problem  But it's not  The end of the world  Yeah, yeah  Because that's  That's been the whole thing  Is we are  Killing the planet  Which always cracks me up  I think the planet  Will be just fine  With or without us 
[01:53:30]  On it  Yeah, it's us  Who are the problem  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Yeah, yeah  And I don't know  It seems to me  Like these countries  That are just coming  Into the industrial age  Are doing a lot more damage  Than we are  With, you know  Cars that emissions  Are lower than  They've ever been  I think as Americans  We're doing a pretty good job  I think the rest of the world  Is kind of dropping  The ball on it  But we always take the heat  Well, I think  I certainly think  You're right in pointing out  The things that are 
[01:54:00]  Going to matter  In this century  Is China and India  Right  It's not the US or Europe  And so in that sense  You need to get a grape  Even if we, you know  Cut our emissions dramatically  It's not going to matter  Unless China and India  Also does something  Right  And of course  And they're not going to  One of the things  I think we forget  Is China in this decade  Is bringing 200 million people  Out of poverty  That's an amazing fact  And how?  By powering them  With an economic growth  Basically powered by coal  And, you know  They're not going to say 
[01:54:30]  Oh, sorry  We'll go back into poverty  And, you know  Cut back our emissions  Right, right  We don't forget  On this program  It's the first thing  We talk about every morning  200 million people  I'm so happy  But in reality  That underscores the point  Of saying  Unless you get  Cheap technology  Unless you get  For instance  Solar panels  To be cheaper  Than fossil fuels  You will never get it  Out of this niche  Feel good  Rich Westerners  Buying a little bit  Of  What is that?  Of feeling like  They're doing something 
[01:55:00]  I couldn't think of the word  But we  You almost did  Unless you can get  Out of that  Peace of mind  Peace of mind  Unless you can actually  Get those technologies  To become cheap  We won't be able  To solve this problem  And so  The film is really  About saying  Let's stop  Subsidizing these  Solar panels  Let's start making sure  We invest in research  So basically  You're saying  The original title  Of this was  Al Gore's an asshole  And you figured  That wouldn't sell  You think that he  Over blew everything  Just to have  Dramatic effect  Honestly 
[01:55:30]  I think Al Gore  Did a lot of good  Because he got  People aware  Of the problem  But he did some  Bad  In overselling  The problem  The catastrophe  And panicky  It's the natural  Idea of saying  I have an important  Message  I'm going to  Ramp it up  A little bit  But what happens  In the long run  This is a long run  Problem  You're not going  To get people's  Attention  You're going  To drive them  Tight  You're going  To make this  Into a very  Polarized issue  And in the long run  You lose people  Showing Florida  Disappearing  But you know  10 years after 
[01:56:00]  People go down there  And they're like  It's still there  Yeah  Here it is  And he shows  It slowly disappearing  Because the water  Level's going up  And New York City's  Gone and it's  Underwater  San Francisco  I wasn't buying  Into that  What do you think  About the latest  Advocate for  Taking care of  Global warming  Charles Manson  Did you hear  About that one  Yeah  Remember  Bin Laden has  Also been big  On global warming  Oh well  He's somebody 
[01:56:30]  That could be  Trusted  But then again  I don't think  We should burden  Al Gore  With the  Unlikely  Alliances  That he's going  To have  I think it's  Much more important  To recognize  That so many  People just want  To feel good  About themselves  And say  Oh yes  I really care  About global warming  And then  A fair number  Of celebrities  Will get into  Their private jets  Afterwards  Yeah  Which doesn't  Quite sound right  But the real  Point here is  Again to recognize  If you're going  To do something  It's about innovation  Take computers  Back in the 1950s 
[01:57:00]  How do we make  Better computers  Well the solution  Certainly wasn't  To buy a computer  For everyone in 1960  That would have  Been silly  You know  Clear out your  Basement  Here comes the  Computer  Yeah  And it wasn't  Taxing alternative  Technologies  You didn't get  Computers going  By taxing typewriters  It was about  Getting better  Technology  And of course  Once you got that  There you go  You know  IBM and Apple  Make computers  That we want  Can I ask a question  Do you agree  There was a doctor  And I always  He's an idiot  A Dr. Chipperson 
[01:57:30]  And he said  That for global warming  They should get  Everybody air conditioners  Or something  That's crazy  Because the emissions  That are put out  By  Well actually  I think they don't  Use Freon anymore  So Chip is wrong  On that  Dr. Chipperson said  That Freon is no good  You should charge for it  On  No  Stop  Well the fundamental  Point is to  Recognize  If you're talking  About heat waves  One of the things  I find amazing  Is that people  Will say  Well let's cut back  On carbon emissions 
[01:58:00]  Which of course  Will still mean  It gets warmer  And warmer  But slightly  Why don't we talk  About making cities  Cooler  There's much  Leather jackets  For everybody  No I don't think  You can have that  Fondy noises  I don't think  That kind of cool  Yeah  You could actually  Paint rooftops  In light colors  Stop having asphalt  Being that very  Very dark color  We know how  To make it lighter  That would actually  Cool cities dramatically  Now I have to say  You wrote a book  Called The Skeptical Environmentalist  In the Danish  You know you had  Some controversy  Oh absolutely 
[01:58:30]  Where they said  That you were  Fabricating data  And deliberately  Misleading  The use of  Statistical methods  And plagiarism  And you complained  To the Ministry  Of Science  Technology and Innovation  And you got  The original decision  Annulled  Due to procedural errors  Now was it  They just didn't go  About giving  The truth right  Or did their  Procedural errors  Actually cause them  To say something wrong  Yeah  That's  The way you  State it  Makes it  Sounds like I  Got free  In a technicality 
[01:59:00]  Right  No that's  Yeah yeah  And the main  The main problem  With the decision  Was that they  Didn't have one  Single example  Of what I actually  Did wrong  Okay  They didn't feel  Like it was  Necessary to actually  Prove me wrong  And in many ways  I think that  Summarizes much  Of what's happened  Certainly in my  Controversy  That when I go  Out and say  Listen global  Warning is real  But it's not  The end of the world  We need to be smarter  It so offends  Some people  And the sort of  Political correctness  That many people  Feel fine to say  Oh you're wrong 
[01:59:30]  And we don't even  Have to prove it  It strikes me  That you need to  Actually look at  How have we been  Doing for the last  20 years  For instance  On global  Warning  And the truth is  We've been big  On promises  But we haven't  Actually done anything  And that's why  I think it's  Reasonable to start  Listening  Is there other  And perhaps smarter  Ways forward  But I've noticed  And I brought this up  Last night on  Red Eye  It was  We as people  Don't really do things  Until we really  Really have to  You didn't bring that up  Greg did  Yes I did  I did 
[02:00:00]  Greg got felt  No  And I was  Talking about  The problems  With fossil fuels  And the fact  That alternative energy  Yes I was  And looking for options  And alternatives to that  Won't really happen  Until the last drop of oil  Is squeezed out of the ground  And then the next day  We'll have something else  We're only as innovative  As we have to be  Which is what I've noticed  In my observations 
[02:00:30]  Of humanity  Well I certainly think  That's very true  That unless we focus  A lot more on it  We're not going to do it  We need to focus  A lot more on innovation  And innovation has always been  What's gotten us out  Of most sticky problems  Because remember  Most of the environmental movement  And certainly today  On Earth Day  Most people are going to be saying  Oh do with less  Could you cut back  Could you not have your car  All these things  But remember  The reason why we burn  Fossil fuels  Is not to annoy Al Gore  It's because it powers  Pretty much everything  We like about civilization 
[02:01:00]  Because it's great  It works  It heats you  It cools you  It brings you food  It gets you places  We are not going to stop  And obviously  As we talked about  The Chinese and Indians  Are going to use a lot more  Yeah  And I understand them  Why they do that  So if we're going to solve this  We need to be able to provide  All those great comforts  But without the CO2  That's about technology  See now  I can't deal with that  Because I first of all  I drive an Escalade  I love it  Big SUV  I heat my pool  To about 95 degrees 
[02:01:30]  For the entire summer  I forget to turn lights out  Like when I'm going to bed  I might flip a few lights out  And I'll notice  I left all the lights on downstairs  And I'll just go  Fuck it  And I'll go to bed  Yeah  I am  My carbon footprint  Giant  Yeah  Giant  But I don't really think  I'm hurting anything  I think there's somebody else  Like  I don't know  Riding a bike to work  Some  Oh my god  That's me  I'm the guy  You are just offsetting  Are you a bike just offsetting 
[02:02:00]  You and Ed Beagley Jr.  Ed Beagley Jr.  I am  I am ruining  What you're doing  On a daily basis  Well but I hope  And I really think  The only solution to this  Is eventually  All of your lights  Will be powered  By cheap green energy  And then of course  You can let them burn  As much as you want  Well that would be nice  If eventually  That would happen  But again  I don't see it happening  Until we find  Some kind of  It's got to be  As convenient  As fossil fuels are  To use  We are right near a star  Do you think 
[02:02:30]  That we don't use it  Because it's simply  I think there's always  This paranoid thinking  That the big companies  Buy up the patents  For these great technologies  Because they're smart  To do so  I mean they're going  To get fucked  If they don't  So why are we not  Using that kind of energy  I know we can  We don't use gas  To power the stupid  Space station  Yeah  I mean there's  There's a lot of sense  Good point Jim  People think  That we have all  These technologies  That have just been  Hidden from us  But actually  If you look at it  We get lots and lots  Of sunlight 
[02:03:00]  And we could power  The entire world  For a whole year  With the sunlight  That comes in  For just one hour  That's crazy  That's an amazing opportunity  The reason why  We don't do it  Is because  It would be very  Very costly  As of right now  But prices have been  Coming down  They're somewhere  Between four and  Ten times as expensive  As fossil fuels  Right now  But they've been  Coming down  Dramatically every day  Who's chart  Isn't it amazing  That we have this thing  There's a star  That gives us everything  And we can't do it  Thank you Jim  Because there's enough 
[02:03:30]  Oh  You meant me  No no no no  No you're a fucking  You're a fucking  Black hole  And you just  You suck all joy  And happiness  Out of everything  And even a smile  Cannot escape  It's  But it's funny  How we are as a species  Like there's a star  That should be  And we're just  There's too much  Fucking  It costs too much  It doesn't make sense  To me at all  Yeah we have the ability  In some way  The reason why 
[02:04:00]  Fossil fuels are much cheaper  I'm a millionaire  By the way  There you go  But really  The fossil fuels  Have collected sunlight  Millions of years ago  They simply  Concentrated sunlight  If you will  And that's why  It's very very easy  To dig it out of the ground  And turn it into energy  Right now  But of course  In the long run  We'll be able to use  That much less  Concentrated energy  That comes from the sun  Directly  So it seems to me  Very very likely  That in the next 50 years  We will be powered  Mainly by green sources  What we have to be 
[02:04:30]  Sure we do  And that's really  The message for Earth Day  And the message in the film  Is to say  Instead of making  These feel good moves  That won't really  Get us anywhere close  We should be investing  Dramatically more  In technology  Making innovations  That will make this happen  Sooner rather than later  I've noticed  Solar companies  Have kind of been  Taking some upticks  In the stock market  I think a lot of people  Are starting to  Invest in them  You know  Could I just  Disappoint you there though  The reason why  That's happening  Is because 
[02:05:00]  We're subsidizing  Them heavily  Of course  If you're selling  A product  That we pay  Lots and lots  Of money for  Of course  The stock price  Will go up  But they're still  Not anywhere  Close to competitive  And that's why  But won't that  Just take time  How would you  Accelerate that then  And make it so  That technology  Is cheaper  Because it just  Seems like  With computers  And everything  There's this  Natural progression  Where you have  To go through  So many years  For the price  To come down  Big screen TVs  Everything like that  But the trick is  In 1950 
[02:05:30]  Don't start  Buying a lot  Of computers  Don't try to say  Oh if we produce  A lot of computers  These vacuum tubes  Will be much faster  It's about making  A transistor  It's about making  An integrated circuit  So hold off  A little while  Improve the technology  And then  Open it up  I'm from Denmark  We put up  Lots and lots  Of windmills  In the 70s  80s  90s  18  1770s  People are crazy  For windmills  Over there  We felt very  Very proud  Of all of them  We cut down  All of them 
[02:06:00]  Really  Because they're  Incredibly inefficient  We've replaced  Them with more  Efficient ones  But I'm simply  Was it a smart  Thing to put up  The first 10,000  That we then  Pulled down again  They've replaced  It with giant  Outdoor air conditioners  There you go  Again  And slave labor  Don't talk about that  That gives us  A bad name  Again with your  Air conditioning  Jimmy  What  You can't air  Condition outside  Heaps gotta go  Somewhere  You can't get  Something for  Nothing  Colin had a  Very funny joke 
[02:06:30]  In his special  About  About how we're  Trying to tell  People in the  Sedan  Who just got  Air conditioning  That they  Shouldn't use it  It was very funny  That's great  They just got it  Like 20 years ago  Yeah  It's like what  We're supposed to  Turn this off  Yeah  You guys  Not use it for a while  So you're saying  Invest in certain  Technologies  And a little more  Research  Let's get these  Things efficient  And lower cost  Basically what the  Film shows is  There are lots and 
[02:07:00]  Lots of great  Ideas out there  Now most of them  Are not going to  Come true  Or they're not  Going to become  Cost effective  But those are the  Things that we  Should be focusing on  Unfortunately  For the last 20  Years  Research money  Has gone down  Not up  In green energy  Why  Because we're so  Focused on  Cutting the next  Ton  On feeling good  On putting up  That you know  Sialis  Viagra  I know  He got back  Into that  I know  He'll do that  The iconic  Solar panel  Rather than  Making sure  That we get 
[02:07:30]  Cheap solar panels  So that everyone  Also the Chinese  And the Indians  Will buy  Yeah  The guy  That lives  Behind me  Just pretty much  Covered the back  Of his roof  With solar panels  And I'm thinking  Like I remember  Seeing those  Huge satellite  Dishes in  People's  Backyards  And now  You know  You get a  Little dish  Out the window  At some point  This yeah  The technology  Has got to  Get smaller  And cheaper  And then  It'll compete  With fossil fuels  And we'll all  Have them  Yeah  That's the trick  Right  Nobody have to  Convince you  To buy a  Computer today  Because it's 
[02:08:00]  Actually so great  You want to  Buy it  Yeah  Nobody has to  Convince you  To buy a  Cell phone  We don't have  These international  Treaties where  Okay we're  Going to promise  To buy a  Million  Cell phone  We buy them  Because they're  Cheap  Because the  Way we should  Have it with  Great energy  It shouldn't be  About this  Earth day  Oh thou  Shall not  You need to  Buy this  That are  Inefficient and  Inconvenient  It should be  About say hey  This is great  Technology I'll  Buy it  So you're saying  Burn coal  Burn fuel  Until we can  Well I'm saying  It's very unrealistic  That that's not  Going to happen  Unless we come up 
[02:08:30]  With technology  The last 20 years  We have been going  Down the wrong road  We need to start  Thinking about  Are there smarter ways  Will they eventually  Have like little  Chips that can  Harness  What happened  What's that  Little chips  That can harness  What's that  Solar power  It's almost like  100 years from now  50 years  Yeah yeah  Something a lot  Smaller  That will harness  The same amount  Of power  They can't really  Be small because  They need to  Actually harness  The sun  But eventually  We might be able  To  Much cheaper  And what's 
[02:09:00]  I mean  One of the things  I would imagine  Is we'll have them  All kinds of places  They'll be  In your rooftop  Just simply integrated  They might be  Right right  It'll automatically  Be there  And it'll be cheap  You know  You'll just put it  Wherever  And then you'll  Harness the energy  I hear you  I was wrong  I thought I had a good point  That's  No no  I like  No I like your take on it  I definitely like your take on it  It's better than these people that  Panicky Pete's  As they say  And people like me  Spill their crumbs  In front of them  I don't give  I don't really give a shit 
[02:09:30]  What are you doing lines of crackers  Like the coke  Fucking messy Marvin  I'm from the school of thought  That I'll be gone  Let the next generation  Take care of it  That is pretty much  Where I've been  My whole existence  We've had to deal with things  That have been caused by the previous generation  And they dealt with the previous generation before them  And I think at some point  The next generation or the generation after that 
[02:10:00]  Will have a problem that they're faced with  And either become extinct  Or fix the problem  And in the meantime  We use the technology we have  To the best of our ability  Keep advancing  And not be forced to stop  Using things that are very convenient  Very available to us  Where I don't think it's in our nature  I think most people want to do a little good  But you know  Recognize how incredibly important  And how difficult it is  In most of the western world  To just deal with pension systems 
[02:10:30]  And with healthcare  I mean you guys are having a huge problem  And we have the same thing in Europe  To deal with these things  And that's going to happen in 10 or 20 years  Believing that we're going to be spending  Vast resources on dealing with a problem in 100 years  Is not going to happen  That's why we need to find smarter  And cheaper ways to deal with it  And that's what the film is about  That's it  Cool it  Cool it  Cool it  It's interesting  Bjorn Lomborg  Is that it?  Right?  I'm actually going to watch the DVD now  I did not want to see it 
[02:11:00]  I just  It's good  I just really  Fucking went to see  Anderson Silva's thing  Because I like MMA  Oh you're crazy  And I was watching hockey  When I was supposed to watch the film  Yeah you dummy  Come on  I will see it  Yeah we'll see it  It's available on DVD today  Earth Day  And it's nice to see a different point of view  Because I'm so sick of fat Al Gore  Telling everybody how to live  Bjorn's in great shape  I'm going to listen to him first  Exactly  He's in phenomenal physical shape  Compared to fat Al Gore  Al Gore's been the face of  You know the global warming  Juggernaut as it were 
[02:11:30]  Oh yeah  And it's nice to see a different take on it  That's a little more realistic  Very good  Thank you  Bjorn thank you  Cool it  It's out today on DVD  And who's next?  Is Jillian Jacobs?  Yes I believe so  Yeah you watch that show Community?  I'm sorry I didn't  It's a huge huge hit here  It's a massive show in America  He's very busy  What's the big show in  Busy guy  In Denmark?  Denmark  Honestly I don't even watch TV  So I just  Why?  What's wrong with you?  I watch Modern Family  Modern Family 
[02:12:00]  That's about  That's about  Advanced of Gus  I like documentaries  Tell you the truth  I watch plenty of them  Love them  What do you like about Modern Family?  Oh it's amazingly funny  Yeah  And short  And short  See?  Because he's busy  Absolutely  He's busy  He's out there  He's a mover and a shaker  A lot of people seem to like that  Yeah  Cool  Very cool  Well thank you Bjorn  Take good care guys  Thanks buddy  Take care man  Absolutely  Jillian Jacobs is next  Yes  Quick break  Stay there  The virus 
[02:12:30]  Call the Opie and Anthony Show now  866-WOW  1-WOW  That's 866-969-1969  Send your feedback to feedback at opianthony.com  The Opie and Anthony Show  I want to thank that guy for coming in today  Bjorn?  Yeah he was terrific  It's like Bajork  It was good stuff 
[02:13:00]  Is Bajork from the same place Bajorn is?  No  As our guest is coming in  We are shoving food into our faces  From DeFonti's in Brooklyn  What's this wee crap?  Oh my god  It's her  Hi  Jillian Jacobs live in studio  We're on the air too  Oh you are?  Okay  She told me  Hi good morning  I know  I like that  Some people get like you know  Are we on the air like halfway through talking  They're like are we on the air?  But you know what  We're flattered by that  Because that means we're just kind of hanging  We're not putting radio voices on  That's what we tell ourselves  We're unprofessional asses 
[02:13:30]  Would you like a sandwich?  You want a Sambo?  You know what  I understand that you guys don't eat breakfast food anymore  But it's a little early for a sandwich  This is lunch for us  Because we've been up since between 4 and 5  Depending on who you're looking at  Our schedule stinks  I do that for community  Yeah  You get up early for that?  Yeah  Why?  Well I have to be there at 5.30 in the morning on Monday  So I get up  Why?  You can do the same thing at 9.30  Why so early?  We don't know why we even get up this early at this point  I know  Like why for a TV show do you got to be up that early? 
[02:14:00]  Because you have to give the actors 12 hours from when you stop shooting  To when you start shooting the next morning  So if we don't start that early on Monday  We'll be starting work at 6 p.m. on Friday  Union rules  You know  It's all the unions  Really?  I'm a big union supporter  So why not just offset the whole thing and wake up a little later  Yeah  And then go to bed a little later  Well I have to get up that early because I'm a girl  And hair and makeup takes a long time  Oh you're naturally beautiful  Oh well thank you very much  Stop  Look at you 
[02:14:30]  Look at you  Well Joel gets to roll in around you know 7  Joel and Chevy show up around 7  But us girls get there at like 5.30 in the morning  Oh really?  We remember when Joel was just kind of you know  Trying to make it  Yeah I heard  And now he's a big star  He used to do our show  Oh the phone calls are great  Yeah  Hey it's Joel  Can I come on the show please?  We'll think about it Joel  My talk soup thing  Yeah  And now look we can't even get him on the phone  Now he's a big star  Although he continues to support us  He hasn't forgotten us  Which is nice  Because most of the people that make it in Hollywood blow us off 
[02:15:00]  That stupid soup show has made so many stars  Yeah  They all come out of that winding up with some kind of movie career or TV career  I know  That's why he did it  I know  It's amazing  Gillian is really funny by the way  Yeah  Really funny  Thank you  And this show is unbelievable  It's very hard to be a comedic actress is it?  Yes  I don't know what I'm doing  Really?  Are you just kind of walking around like I don't know  I'm lucky to be surrounded by all these people  I've learned so much from them  I mean I did really dark depressing independent movies before Community so 
[02:15:30]  Really?  Yes  That's all I ever did  Wait a minute  I'm confused  So you're really funny but you were doing that  So why weren't you doing other funny stuff before Community?  No one would hire me  I couldn't get a job in a comedy  All I could play were prostitutes, strippers, runaway, drug addict, homeless teens  Nice  And so Community was the first time that somebody gave me a chance to do a comedy  And this is pretty much the real you  You'd rather do more comedy than anything else? 
[02:16:00]  It's better for your mental health, I'll say that  Yeah, you go home a little with a smile on your face  Instead of like, Jesus, that was a horrible scene  Yeah, I know, I don't have to hang out, you know, in motels in Whittier, California anymore  Which I'm really happy about  You had to do some of those scenes  Wow  Did you bring the role home with you?  On the off chance that my parents are listening, no  Wow, that's, yeah, we're looking at some of your movies 
[02:16:30]  Can you say  Well, Choke's pretty good  Wait, you were in Choke?  I was in Choke  I was in Choke, I know, I saw that  Well, I'm a huge Palahniuk fan  But I don't like when they make them into movies except for Fight Club  That's you?  That's me  Wow, wow, wow  She's on a stripper pole  Yes, she is  On the pole  Yes, I know  So a red top, barely covering her bosoms  Jeez, Jimmy  What?  It was a very skimpy, sexy top  Yeah, it is  I'm enjoying my sandwich  Sam Rockwell was in that  Sam Rockwell, Angelica Houston 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, that was a big movie Choke  Yeah, it was a really great experience  That might be my second favorite Palahniuk book, too  Really?  Not that anyone cares  Sam Rockwell is probably one of the most underrated actors  He's incredible  The guy's fantastic in everything  I know  And I think he should be a bigger star  I'm going to work on that personally  I support  Try to advance his career  I endorse that  You do?  Yeah  Good  Well, yeah  Is Chubby a nice guy?  Yes, he is  Does he get a bad  When did he start being nice?  No, because does he get a bad  Does he get a bad  He gets a bad reputation  He really does  And me and Ant 
[02:17:30]  I don't know if I ever remember  We sort of met him  We did  What was his  I don't know  John McEnroe's talk show  I know  Oh, really?  Yeah, we were promoting  Coming Back to Radio  And we happened to be on the same show  Was it that  Or was it the other show?  I don't think it was the other one  It was  I fucked it up  Sorry  Finance guy  It was the finance guy show  And they never aired  Oh, whatever  The yelling finance guy?  The angry yelling finance guy?  Oh, no  This was years ago  Before Kramer  Jim Kramer  Yes  I mixed up 
[02:18:00]  I like the other yelling Kramer  From the comedy store  Yeah  Miss Jenner was wonderful  Donnie Deutsch  Donnie Deutsch  Thank you  Oh, okay  My point being  That we were on the same show  As Chevy Chase  And we were in makeup together  And he had a pink sweater on  I remember it like it was yesterday  And I actually introduced myself  And he made believe  I didn't talk  Really?  And I was kind of bummed  That would be bumming  So he does get a bad reputation  But he is a nice guy  Yeah, I mean, I think that  You know, this is the longest  That he's ever worked  With a group of people 
[02:18:30]  You know, he's only on SNL  For one season  So we've done two seasons  Of Community now  And I really do feel like  He's my lovable uncle  Who sometimes puts his foot  In his mouth  But has a really good heart  And he, I think that  You know, he went into this  Obviously not knowing  Who any of us were  You know, aside from Joel  You know, from The Soup  And I really think  That he's, you know  Come to respect all of us  And it's been really, really  A great time to get to spend 
[02:19:00]  This amount of time with him  And, you know, sort of  Become our own little family  In a really cheesy way  You're a consummate diplomat  Oh  You really are  Well, thank you very much  That's very diplomatic  Which one of your parents  Was an alcoholic?  Oh, yeah  She's very good at  Jesus  He's keeping family matters  In the  No, no, no  We all get along fine  Sometimes the furniture's broken  Terrible  I believe her though  She described Chevy perfectly  He gets a bad reputation  He really gets a horrible 
[02:19:30]  A horrible rep out there  But it's a funny fucking guy  You know who really destroyed  His image  Was Howard  Years ago  Oh, yeah  Howard destroyed Chevy's image  I think they're pals now  Are they?  Really?  I don't know  I just remember years ago  And then that talk show he did  Does he ever bring that up?  No  Our first season of Community  They had a list on Entertainment Weekly  Of the worst shows ever in television  Oh, Jesus  And Chevy's talk show made it  And Joel took great pleasure  In showing that to him  Oh, does Joel give him crap?  Yeah  I mean, it's kind of like 
[02:20:00]  The dynamic on the show  That you see between Pierce  Yeah  And Jeff  And yeah, I mean  They love to go at each other  And so Joel had a lot of glee  In showing Chevy  That he'd made the top  Really?  The 25 worst TV shows ever  That is one of those  Memorable things  That will go down in history  As just one of the worst things  That was on television  What number was it  That Chevy made?  It was the top 15  I think  Top 15  Maybe we can find the list  He had him up there  With the Magic Johnson show too 
[02:20:30]  Magic Johnson's talk show  I think they might have  Paired the two of them  They got like a shared number  Yeah  Oh, God  That's awful  What  Now, your previous movies  You said were all dark  Dark, yes  How did that start?  Like, would you just start casting  Like, you look like  A very sweet girl  Why would they cast you like that?  I don't know  I guess I  I don't know what it is about me  That I  Those are the only roles  That I could get  But I  That's good  You look like a girl  We should punch in movies  Well, there's an innocence to her  Yeah  Yeah, yeah 
[02:21:00]  You want to corrupt that  People want to see that  Yeah  I see it  I went to Juilliard  So I moved to New York  For college  To toot my own heart  Dropping that  Nice  Can you do Shakespeare?  Can you do Shakespeare?  That's what I grew up doing  Was Shakespeare  So it was a shock to me  That I was playing  Homeless strippers  Yeah  Wow  Did you have to do  Shakespeare in the Park ever?  They won't have me  Actually  I  You weren't good enough  For Shakespeare in the Park?  No, I wanted to audition  A couple years ago  And they wouldn't  They wouldn't see me  So  How did they not see you?  They, you know 
[02:21:30]  Maybe if Community does better  Next season  They'll have me  But not yet  Who did you want to  I've played Macbeth  Oh yeah  No  I can't do Shakespeare  Jimmy knows Shakespeare  It looks incomprehensibly hard  I know you're shy  But you want to give her  One line from your Shakespeare?  You don't want to  It's okay  He's really good though  He's downplayed  Yeah, we don't want to act right now  The best Shakespeare I've ever seen  And it's so hard to do  Is when watching Brando do  And Julius Caesar 
[02:22:00]  Watch  Like that's the only person  I've ever seen do it  Where it looks like  They actually felt  What they were saying  When you're reading Shakespeare  This is a dumb actor question  But when you're reading Shakespeare  You actually comprehend  The message they're trying to give  You're not just fucking  Memorizing the words  And saying it  Reading words  Yeah, I think that  In order for it to make  Any sense to the audience  You have to know  What you're saying  I know that sounds like  A dumb question  I know, but yeah  I mean sometimes  Sometimes it takes  Getting out the dictionary  And you know  The encyclopedia  And you know  Spending a couple hours  And sometimes  On one line  Yeah, I know 
[02:22:30]  What does that mean?  Well they actually have  These dictionaries  For Shakespeare  Where they have a list  Of every single word  In Shakespeare  And it's definition  So that kind of  Speeds it up for you  Who did you want to play?  Or who did you want to do  In the park?  I wanted to be Hermia  In A Midsummer Night's Dream  What's Hermia like?  Hermia is small and angry  Which I thought  Would be a good fit for me  Oh yeah  That's good  Because I'm short  So you know  There's all these references  To Hermia being small  And I thought  It would be a good fit  But you're petite  Not short  Yeah, I'm petite  I'm very petite  How tall are you?  I'm like 5'3 and a half 
[02:23:00]  That's not short  No  Really?  I've been told it is  5'3 is on the border  Joel's 6'3  Oh, that's crazy  And Chevy's 6'3 too  So next to them  I feel  You're just on the border  Being short  Okay  You're a petite delight  Yes  Thank you very much  You're a fine dish  Danielle yesterday  Was short  She was short  She was a twerp  We had a 5 footer yesterday  5 footer  She was a twerp  And we told her  Right to her face  She needed to be heard  My grandpa's under  5 feet tall  A grandpa?  Yeah  My grandpa's 
[02:23:30]  6 feet under  See?  Yeah  Wow  What a pilot to bombardier  That wasn't bad  It was just kind of sad  Actually  Because he has passed on  Screw him  How tall is he?  He's going to be 94 soon  Wow  And he is  I'd say  4'10  Wow  Did he shrink?  Yeah  Over the years?  He has  Osteogenesis imperfecta  Oh man  I love that band  Is he a little person?  No he's not  He just  He went from about  5'3 to 4'10 
[02:24:00]  Over the course of his life  Because under 5 foot  You're considered  A little person  Well he is little  Depends on age  Wow that's good  Is he still a go-getter?  You know  Yeah in the nursing home  Yeah he's a real  Is he chasing the nursing home?  He's on the  Resident council board  Against his  One day he called me  And asked me to recite  The pledge of allegiance  To him  Because he had to lead  The residence council  In it  And he couldn't remember  So I  Those are the calls  You get  Please tell me 
[02:24:30]  Please tell me  You didn't do it right  On purpose  Oh no  You got it  I mean you're a funny person  You can understand  I don't want to get him  In trouble  He was very nervous already  Because he didn't want  To be on the resident council  I don't remember  Saying anything  About white supremacy  It does grandpa  Just trust me  My grandpa starts a race riot  At the nursing home  Is he in one of those homes  Where they scream a lot  Because I can't take that  Yes  My grandmother was there  Before him  And one time  We went to visit her 
[02:25:00]  And there were people  In their beds  In the hallway  Chanting  Put us to bed  We don't want to live  We want to die  Oh that's wonderful  When you see that  As a 12 year old  You don't ever forget it  That stays with you  Our listeners chant every day  I don't get to screaming  Enough of the screaming  I'm trying to sleep  Yeah you'd be screaming too  It's old  Your life's over  Just waiting  It's terrible  My parents were in  A horrific car accident  Which you know  My dad didn't make it  And my mom ended up  In a nursing home  And I would walk down  The hall to visit her 
[02:25:30]  And the old people  Would grab at you  As they're screaming  Yeah  What the hell's that about  Kill me  And they would scream  Help me  Like some weird shit  Was happening  When the lights go down  In that place  Wow  Well you never know  You don't really know  What's going on there  I know  I just wanted to share that  There's nothing funny  In that story  No there wasn't  There wasn't at all  It's okay  I've got to pull him  Out of there  My dad's going to go home  Now feeling like  She did have to make it  Some of those older  Movies she made  We got  Travis is a huge fan 
[02:26:00]  Of community  And so is Sam  Thank you  You guys got a question  For  Yeah you were  Critical Travis  No actually  For Gillian  The complete opposite  Pause  Because why isn't it  Jillian  With a G  My mom saw it  In the name book  And thought it was  Gillian  She didn't know  People said Jillian  Wow  But I like it that way  Thank you  Because it's different  Thank you  Nothing wrong with that  But you're constantly  Called Jillian  It's a conversation starter  Yeah it is  I always have something  To talk about  I think  Hey I'm  In community  I think that's 
[02:26:30]  A better conversation  Starter though  I don't want to  Lead with that  You don't want to  Lead with that  I don't want to  Lead with that  I do have a hack question  Did you realize  You guys had a hit  Because it's  It's pretty much  The hottest  Show on TV  But I mean  When you guys  Started filming  Did you think  This had potential  To be the  Number one show  Well I'll say this  I did a couple  Pilots before community  And this is the only  One I ever worked  I don't care about  Your sex life  Oh  See  I was insinuating  That shit  Men that fly aircraft  After having sex with you  I'm going to have 
[02:27:00]  To rephrase that  In the future  To avoid that comment  Look out for me  I acted in a few  Pilot presentations  Before community  Much better  And  Glad I could help  I would say  The community  Is the only one  That got better  As we shot it  The other ones  Like you get notes  From the studio  You get notes  From the network  And it sort of  Dilutes it  And it gets worse  And worse and worse  And this is the only one  Where it got better  The writing got better  And then I met the cast  And I mean  You know  I think Donald Glover  Is a genius 
[02:27:30]  And is going to be  A huge movie star  And Danny Pudi  And Joel  And Allison  And Yvette  And so  I mean  They elevated the material  Even more  And that's I think  When we sort of  Got the first hint  That maybe this could be  Something good  And it is  With that  Travis what do you got  I just want to say  Like it's one of those  Few shows  Where the pilot  Is legitimately funny  And it's hard to do that  Because you've got to  Introduce characters  You have to know  Who they are  And it's like  Arrested Development  Seinfeld  And like  Community  You really thought  Was like  Right off the bat  Funny  Instead of like  Okay that was okay 
[02:28:00]  I'll give it a shot  Next week  It was right off the bat  Funny  And they do a lot  Of  You know  Quick inside jokes  Movie references  And stuff  So my question is  As it's become  More successful  Has NBC  Given you guys  Just you know  Complete control  How long is this  Question  It's endless  It was a compliment  And then a question  It's endless  So you went to Juilliard  And they flew you out 
[02:28:30]  First class on American  I don't even know  What the question was  You guys do a lot  Of really  Just different stuff  Shut up  That's a good question  He meant you do  A lot of different stuff  Yeah  I would say that  We've been given  A lot of free reign  By NBC  As evidenced by the fact  That they let us do  A stop motion animation  Christmas episode  Yep  Like they do a whole episode  Of stop motion  They did one  She just said that  It revolved  You know  We're all friends 
[02:29:00]  You did a whole  Paintball episode  And you're going to do  Another one right  That was a really funny  Episode by the way  Thank you  Jeez  So yeah  It just seems like  This show gets a lot more  Innovative  It's very innovative  It really  A lot of shows  Don't take the chances  That community does  Dan Harmon  Who created our show  Said that he just  Wanted to do everything  That he ever wanted  To do on a TV show  Oh really  Just in one show  In the first two seasons  I think 
[02:29:30]  So you know  His joke is  We might not have  Anything to do  Season three  We've done it all  But like last night's episode  I just thought  Was  I've never seen anything  Like it on TV  For those who didn't see it  Don't spoil it  I haven't seen it yet  Well I'll just say this  It's a fake clip show  Where we're referring back  To episodes that never happened  How smart is that  God damn it  That's funny  That's a great idea  That is really funny  Isn't that great  So it was like  Over 70 scenes  I mean we gave the  You had to film 70 scenes  For one  Yeah  Because they're clips  That were not ever on 
[02:30:00]  Yeah  Wow  That's very funny  Thanks for that  Jesus  That's great  Very innovative  We got one day  On the Universal back lot  And we were running around  Like mad men  You know going to like  The western town  The haunted mansion  The train station  And it just felt like  What about the  Burnt down  Back to the future set  We actually  What did we use  We used the  War of the Worlds  Burnt down  Oh right  Right  Yeah  Yeah  So that  With the plane  Crashed in there  I went on the  Universal Studios tour  So I got to see that  Back lot  Well yeah 
[02:30:30]  Not as an actor  You know with free reign  I was on a tram  It was kind of  Unfortunate for us  Because there were  These preset like  Smoke going off  Yeah  And alarms  Because of the tour  So we would have to  Stop shooting  Like every two minutes  Yeah  And it's so bad  Because it's like  I hated that  It's like  I'm on the Universal Studios tour  We're going to have to  Take a detour here  Because filming is being  Done right now  For our community  And you're like  Fuck that's why  I came on this stupid tour  Yeah  I don't care  I've seen the Psycho House  80 times already  And by the way 
[02:31:00]  That's right behind  The Psycho House  Yeah  All that crap  So you go up there  And you see  And then you realize  The Psycho House  Is really small  It's tiny  Forced perspective  The magic of movies  It is magical  Isn't it  It's magical  I'm sorry  I ridiculed your question  Travis  Yeah  Travis took that seriously  Apology accepted  Feel free to ask  Another one  I apologize  I have no more  You're in the know  In Hollywood right  In the know  Is that even mean  1950s  Exactly  I want to see  Welcome to the  Jack Parr show 
[02:31:30]  Thank you  Is that Barbra Streisand  I don't  I don't know  Well that's why  We're asking  Who says that it is  Everybody  You're apparently  In the know  Doesn't look like  Geddy Lee  Doesn't she  I'm about to break out  As a big fucking  Film guy  Okay  But you make  It's going to happen  It's going to happen  In the south  I usually walk around  And film homeless guys  And hope they shit  But in this case  That's been done already  I'm sorry  You've got to get a new angle  I think 
[02:32:00]  We now think  That I might have  Captured Barbra Streisand  At a bus stop yesterday  And so we want  Your honest opinion  Jimmy says 100%  And my friend Anthony  Says 100%  Show it moving  Show it moving  Show it moving  Yes  And that's  That's rolling  So I met  Yes  So I walk up  No that's not  Barbra Streisand  Wait you haven't  Seen her face yet  She's waiting for a bus  That giant hat  She's not waiting for a bus  Are you Barbra Streisand  No I'm not  I don't know 
[02:32:30]  I think that's her  She's sick of getting  That question  That's what I have to do  Do you think that really  That she's not  But she's so tired  Of hearing that  But my pals say  It's Barbra Streisand  I thought it was a lookalike  To be honest  But now I'm thinking  Wow maybe I did  Get Barbra Streisand  Here's why it's her  Because it looks  Exactly like her  But because  She was wearing  A giant floppy hat  To hide  A huge coat  Yep  And she came back  To the same spot  She was not waiting  For a bus  Look at the camera  She had a fake nose  And glasses on 
[02:33:00]  Oh  You don't think  It's a hammer  If it's not Barbra Streisand  She could be making  A lot of money  Yeah it's Barbra Streisand  Right now  Yeah so  She should get to Vegas  Obviously hiding her face  For some reason  Look at the big chin  The space between the lip  And the chin  Yep  The lips are very similar  I'll give you that  And the chin  The lines  What do they call  The lines  The lines  The lines  These lines  Laugh lines  The mouth lines  Laugh lines  Same thing  That's why I'm going to  Stop laughing  In like two years  Stop laughing  Come on this show  You have a perfect face 
[02:33:30]  If you hang around  With us  But you know  You know what's  Really amazing though  How long is that clip  A minute  A minute  And you got more  Of Barbra Streisand  Than she was in  Little Falkers  That's right  Oh  Worst movie ever  Right  Yes  You were saying  Before the show  Watch here comes  Diplomacy  No  I've never seen it  I've heard it was good  I've heard it was good  It's a great cast  You are  Legends  So Hollywood  It's great  She's smart  She's not burning bridges  We burn bridges all the time  Flame on 
[02:34:00]  You're the worst  Sam  You're a big fan  Of the community  What do you got  Oh Sam  Young Sam  Is going to ask  We got  Gillian Jacobs  Of course in studio  For the people  Just checking in  First of all  This is more of a comment  To start the question  Oh good  Yes  Like Travis did  Well Travis  We thought the whole thing  Was a question  That's why we got confused  Travis did a summation  Explain what a pilot was  For anybody  Who didn't quite know  A pilot  Introduces  Excellent  You have to double space 
[02:34:30]  Good point  The Malcolm Jamal Warner  Sweater joke  Was maybe the best joke  I've ever heard  On television  Wow  I did not see that  Good comment  I did not see that one  He was wearing a sweater  He was on the Cosby show  Of course  Theo  And out of nowhere  They go  Oh that's a nice sweater  And he goes  Thanks my dad gave it to me  And they just kept going  Say just leave it  At that  Malcolm Jamal  Malcolm Jamal Warner  So why are you telling her  Just saying it's good  She's on the show  I'm proud of it  But that doesn't mean anything  How about something  She did that was good 
[02:35:00]  She didn't write the line  I don't know if she wrote it  What was the best thing  She might have contributed  It's like when people say  Hey I listened to the show today  It was good  She's so uncomfortable  I'm sorry  No you know what it was  It was a good show  Yeah  Thank you  But what has she done that's good  How about something that she did  Yes  Well I was going to ask her  Hey you know that episode  Of the soup you did  No see wrong person  That's not her  That's not her  What I was going to ask  And it relates to our show too  Is what was it like  To work with LeVar Burton  Oh amazing  Wow  I mean it was  Jerry Norton doesn't like LeVar  I don't dislike LeVar 
[02:35:30]  Oh okay  No I think you have a problem  He really hates LeVar Burton  Jimmy loves getting autographs  And pictures with celebrities  Here's what happened  We were in Roots together  And we fought the whole time  On the set  You gotta let that go  Yeah really  Exactly  Jimmy like you  You gotta work through that  Jimmy I don't know if you know  This is really famous  He really is  I'm a nobody  He's actually  You know you're famous  You know right  Yeah  See she knows  Well that's because we're both  You know  He was in Spider-Man  We're in the know in Hollywood  Yeah exactly  Well I think we sort of 
[02:36:00]  Showed at a party once  And I was like  Hey you are  But he likes getting  Celebrity photos  I just like taking pictures  With people  That's great  And LeVar Burton  Kind of was a dick about it  Oh  Yeah  So now he hates him  This is what drove me nuts  About LeVar Burton  I asked him for a photo  We had just interviewed  William Shatner  Yeah  And he thought I was a Trekkie  Which I fucking not  And I go  Hey can we get a picture together  And he goes  Let me just complete this mission first  No  He actually says he had to go do something 
[02:36:30]  He talked to me in Trekkie talk  It was Trekkie talk  Yeah  I guess he's got enough  But I'm sure that kills at a convention  Right  That's like solid material  Somebody would be like  Oh my god  Good point  I know  Jordy just told me  He's got to complete a mission  He wasn't that bad  It was just  You know he's probably tired of those nerds  Asking him for pictures  Yeah I think  Those Trek fans  He's probably tired of them  They're nerds  She didn't appreciate that  Gillian's not  And she's going to go  You know everyone can be a fan  Of whatever they want to  And it's fine  She knows  I used to put my headband  In front of my eyes  And pretend I was his character 
[02:37:00]  On Star Trek  When I was little  Did you?  Yes  That's so weird  I am a nerd  I always thought it looked  More like a purulator air filter  On his eyes  You're right  It did kind of have  An air filter look to it  Hey I've got to ask you  A question about Joel  Okay  Has he had follicle implants  From the back to the front  Because it looks like  He's got a little more hair  On the front than he used to  Oh I don't know  His hair's looked the same  The whole time I've known him  Really?  Yeah  Because he had like  Almost a Phil Collins thing happening 
[02:37:30]  He did?  Yeah yeah yeah  Because that's what's going to happen  On my hair  You're going to get the Phil Collins?  No I don't want to get the Phil Collins  I want to get rid of the Phil Collins  I was just wondering  If he had gotten any follicles  Taken from the back  And put up on the front  Does my hair look alright?  Yes  Oh alright  That's all  See look look  Joel's got like  See there's something going on there  Look  See dude  I think he got  Oh I never noticed that  Fuck if it looks that good on him  I'm doing it 
[02:38:00]  Yeah I think he got some follicle implants  He so got it done  It's looked the same  The whole time I've known him  So  Can we wake him up?  Again  Perfect answer  We got his number  My god this girl is amazing  At this  But if he did get a little  You're in the know  If he did get a little  Hair thing done  Yeah  That's not a big deal  There's nothing wrong with it  Believe me  I had it done  Sure you did  That's why you have a hat on  That's why he wears the hat  Because it came out really bad  It's actually a hat hair set  It's fine  We've never seen it  Since he got it done  Because he knows  It came out fine  Uh oh  This has never happened 
[02:38:30]  Wow  That looks great  That is a beautiful head of hair  Yeah  Holy shit  You should be chasing  Danny Lloyd  Through a fucking hedge maze  How bad did you want to make fun of him  And look at the fucking full head of hair he's got  The headphones like  Fuck it up in the middle  So I wear a hat a lot  And it's a  Yeah see  If you're doing TVS  Good luck  But I think he got follicle transplant  That's alright  I can't speak to that  That's good  You just go  Go down there to Bosley  Ant looks great 
[02:39:00]  Bosley  Yeah  What's Bosley  Bosley is the place that does the  They take a swath of your scalp from the back  Where it's genetically predetermined that it doesn't go bald  That's why people go with that horseshoe bald  And they don't lose it  So they take that  And they just stitch it closed  And your scalp  You know  Heels and everything  And then they take all those little follicles  And unlike the old days  Where they took these big Barbie doll kind of  Like hair things  And plugs  And pop them in your head  They dissect that 
[02:39:30]  That swath into  One strand of hair  Two strands  And three strands  And then they  They artistically place them  In the natural direction  That your hair grows  Jesus  And then it becomes growing hair  That's yours  Do you know if you photograph his head from space  It actually spells out something  Yes  I told them to  It's actually a swastika  Right on top of my head  Do you understand she's a huge TV star  And I just want to tell her what Joel went through  And a hot chick  She doesn't want to hear about your head  I want to tell her what Joel obviously went through 
[02:40:00]  Jordan from Scranton writes  Is it called the Phil Collins because the appearance of full hair has all been a pack of lies  All right  A little musical joke  I don't know  What do you do for fun  What do you like  Are you a party girl  No  No  Are you a homebody  She says she's a nerd  I am a nerd  You are  Yeah  I like going to museums  Oh my god  Like the Museum of Natural History  Yeah  I haven't been there in a while  Oh my god  You want to go 
[02:40:30]  Sure  I'll take you  Okay  No you're just doing that for the radio  I know  I took the kids I babysat there  So did I  You used to be a babysitter in New York  Yeah I was  After I graduated from school  I babysat this family in Chelsea for a couple of years  And I would  Oh  I'm looking for a nanny  Go to the music  If you want the job  Man  That would be awesome  I'm free until mid-July  The girl from the community is freaking  And she's got to go back to a number one hit TV show  The cute funny girl from community is my nanny  How cool would that be for both of us 
[02:41:00]  Well it was pretty  We do those like  Both of us  We're both of us  Yeah what a story for her  It would be an honor for me  And it would be cute for you  Can you change diapers and stuff  Yeah I can change diapers  Sure  We should talk  Have you ever been to the MoMA  Yes  Because I do some museums  I don't look like a museum guy  I understand  But I do do the museums  I hate MoMA  I don't get it  Yeah  Why  Could you explain that to me  Well  Because they throw paint on the wall  And it's like it's art or something  Did you go for the  Wow what culture  No 
[02:41:30]  That's a classy way  They throw paint on the wall  MoMA is weird  Because it's like modern art  Right  Yes  I understand the classics  Yeah  The best part was  You set that up with  I don't look like a museum guy  And then said something  That a non-museum guy  There's a reason  You don't look like a museum guy  Yeah  You're like what  It's not a bowl of fruit  It ain't art  That's what I said  I understand it  I like dogs playing cod  But I go  I go into these museums  With an open mind  But the MoMA thing  I didn't get at all  Did you go for the Marina Abramovich  Where the performance artist 
[02:42:00]  That was there for a couple of months  Uh oh  What was that  She sat in a chair  All day every day silently  And you could sit in a chair  Opposite her  What about  No  She also had naked people  Oh yes  I remember that  And I'm going to show you  I know a little bit about art  There was like naked guys and girls  And they stand in the doorway  That's her show  Yeah  That was her  Yeah  And you'd have to  You'd have to kind of shuffle past them  Exactly  You had to make sure  Your cock bulged  Didn't hit like a naked person  You would get kicked out  Yes  Not that you would do that on purpose  But they made it uncomfortable 
[02:42:30]  It's an exhibit  You're not supposed to be  That's part of the art  Yes  Making you feel uncomfortable  See  Eliciting emotions in the viewer  Wait are you being serious  Yeah  See I don't get art sometimes  Because  I don't get art sometimes  No because I want to get art  Sometimes I don't get art either  Sometimes  Is that okay  Yeah  That's art  I think sometimes people try  Just to be  People  Put things under the heading of art  Just because they want to be shocking 
[02:43:00]  Or they want to say something  And I know that I'm describing art  But like to me  If you're purposefully  Just trying to be like obnoxious  Yeah  It's not art if I can do it  I can be naked  And stand in a doorway  And I certainly have  Well  Well here in New York  You get the exhibit every once in a while  Where Mayor Giuliani  Was a classic  Oh yes  I'm trying to remember some of the ones  It was in  What was it  Piss  No not Piss Christ  It was  No it was Poop  It was Elephant Poop  The Virgin Mary  Is that art  An African artist  Yes 
[02:43:30]  I've seen that artist's work  And I think it is  I think that that was pretty reactionary  How would you describe art  How would I describe art  It's not an easy question to answer ever  It's gotta be  It's really not  Oh  A visual representation of  Oh yeah  Okay  The gates  I walked through the gates  In Central Park  That was the biggest  Crock of shit ever  See  There's another great  Cultural moment from  But I do take in the art stuff  I didn't go to the gates 
[02:44:00]  It was the weirdest thing  I can't speak to that  And it was like  It was like union guys  Having to build these things  I'll tell you  Why didn't the artist build it  Um  He came up with it  But he didn't have to build it  Well you see some  You see some artists  Very successful  Well that's very large scale  That would have probably  Taken them months and months  If they had to do it themselves  Right  Yeah  Yeah but if like a Home Depot guy  Is building your art projects  Is it really art  And I'm not even going for a joke  Seriously  I think designing it  Planning it  Well if it's something  Yeah  Definitely the planning of it  And  The only thing that worked 
[02:44:30]  In that whole thing  Was it was Orange Gates  If you guys remember  We talked about this a while ago  And it was a  And Central Park was covered with snow  When it snowed  So the contrast was kind of cool  To look at  But I don't know if that makes it art  I'll tell you an art piece  That I didn't like  That angered me  My friend took me to a performance art festival  In LA  And we were driving up  And we heard a large bang  And then we saw this car  Fly through an intersection  Almost hitting another car  And I found out later  That was someone's piece  Was she basically got in her car  And started reversing into a street 
[02:45:00]  Until she hit a parked car  A stranger's car  And then  And then took off down the street  And I saw it  She almost hit an old man in his car  And what did they call it?  That's not art  Asian driver  It was a white girl  You just lost her  It was a Caucasian girl  She's very mad  But yeah  That I found very angering  And dangerous  Yeah what you just said  Of course  Yeah  She dented a stranger's car  I didn't think that was art  It's all dented  It's not 
[02:45:30]  So  I wish that was art  Where are you from?  What?  I'm sorry  I just trounced on you  That's okay  That's okay  That's okay  The next time you drunkenly hit someone's car  I was going to do a masturbating in public joke  So believe me  You didn't stop  Anything intelligent about to fly out  It's an art piece I'm doing  Called Guy in the Playground  See  Jimmy  We're losing her  We're not losing her  No I'm right here  I'm right here  I'm staying here through all the  Josh abuse jokes  I'm here 
[02:46:00]  Riveting  Jillian you having fun?  I am  Thank you for having me guys  Thanks for coming here  Where are you from?  Pittsburgh  You're from Pittsburgh  Yeah  I'm sorry  You live in LA now though  Why do people say that?  I swear being from Pittsburgh  People say I'm sorry  Because it's really like  They have shitty winners I know  That's true  Your hockey team's good though  Are you a hockey team?  Oh you don't do hockey  I grew up in the same neighborhood  As Mario Lemieux  So I was very aware of hockey 
[02:46:30]  How's your slap shot?  Excellent  Actually one of my classmates  In elementary school  Would go to Mario Lemieux's house  Every single day  And knock on the door  And ask him to play hockey with him  And every day  Mario Lemieux said no  Well because he's a jerk off  That's  See  Hockey fans know he's a jerk off  Is he?  And a lot of Penguins fans  Would admit that too I think  I don't know  See I don't know  He seems like a nice enough guy  Seems a nice enough man  He does  Wonderful things for the Penguins  He loves performing in Pittsburgh 
[02:47:00]  He loves the people of Pittsburgh  I do  It's a great  The Air Proves is a great club  And I've done it  The Bynum Theater  Whatever it's called  I mean Pittsburgh is a very fun place  They're loyal to our show  Yes they are  So obviously Pittsburgh isn't that bad a place  And they shouldn't say I'm sorry  So you still live there right?  No I don't live there  See there's the rub  Well that's  Yeah they call it Generation Exodus  Because everybody leaves  Yeah it is the second oldest population in the country  After a county in Florida  Yeah  Are you in L.A. now?

[02:51:00]  Yes  They did a production of  A Midsummer Night's Dream  When I was at Juilliard  To bring it full circle  And they needed more actors  Because we didn't have enough people  In our cast  So they hired three actresses  From New York  To play fairies in it  And she was one of them  Natalia right?  Yes  Yeah  Jason is there  Hooked me up with her  I'd sex with her  Yes yes  So I did a play with her  And Jimmy had sex with her  Exactly  We were friends with a pimp  She performed both times  We were friends with a pimp  And he offered us all an hour  Yes and I took it  You did?

No no it was Omar  Oh it was Omar 
[02:56:30]  Was it Omar?  Oh okay  And we got fucking Lester Freeman from The Wire too  Well we're huge fans of The Wire  I know we're going to talk about the new thing  Which is awesome too  Oh yeah  See how that works  Everyone says it every time  Everyone does that  Because we  We like to hang  We like to hang  Just going  No one ever knows  That's good  I gotta get ready for this show  It's like get ready for it  We like it that long though  I know  We just like dragging people in 
[02:57:00]  And it's like  Mike's are on already  Fuck it  That shit works  Fuck it  You know  People never know they're on  The girl who was just on  Gillian just said  Like we're on the radio  No one knows they're on here  Yeah  Even after the interview  They go  That was on the radio  Exactly  Is that a pre-tape  That they're going to edit  To make it interesting  Yeah  We should be fired  For being so unprofessional  Which could be  We like to think  It's because there's a loose feel here  But it really probably is more  Just complete unprofessionalism  Yeah  Totally  No no  It worked man  Because you know  You're sitting up 
[02:57:30]  I was like  Okay I gotta get ready  I'm gonna be on this show  And everything  We hate that pre-  And then I saw the big security camera  I'm like  Who's that big camera  Oh that guy  I think he said  Who's that big motherfucker  Yeah I did say that  Oh that's right  Suddenly  You can curse  You can curse  You can curse  You can curse  You can curse  You can curse  You can curse  You can curse  You can curse  You just said it sir  It's a whole new world  Isn't it  It's so freeing  Isn't it  That's insane  Fuck yeah  Absolutely  Hey man  You guys had the language  And the wire  That's what was great  About the show too  Just the real language  Yeah David said 
[02:58:00]  The first David Simon  The creator said  People are gonna be on me  About the language  And so he came up to me  And Dominic West  Who played McNulty  And said  I'm gonna write a scene  Where that's all you say  It's one of my favorite scenes  The first year  We're just going around  Oh fuck  Fuck  Fuckity fuck  Fuck  Fuck  Fuck  Get it out of the sea  Get it out of your system  I know man  How hard is it to follow  That show  To do another project  After the show  It's hell  The first time I went out 
[02:58:30]  To California  Was after the wire  And the dross  That came across  The desk  That people wanted  To go up for  It was just crap  I think  That's why people  Are stupid as they are now  Because they watch that crap  That's put on  When you do something  Like the wire  You're spoiled  That's it  That's it  I fell asleep  In the middle  Of a scene  I was doing  At 2 o'clock  And it's just like  Alright just give it to me 
[02:59:00]  And you know  You pipe it in  The other thing is  For me  I was like  Oh thank god  You know  I have something  To put in my obituary  You know  And I thought of one person  Man  And that was Bob Denver  You know  Because I was like  Man I could either  You know  People are like  How do you feel  You know  Be known as the bunk forever  And I'm like  Oh thank you  That's cool  That's a blessing  It does beat Gilligan right  I was like  I'm not fucking Gilligan  That would suck man  I know that sucked man 
[02:59:30]  He's still with us  I don't  I think we finally lost Bob  I don't know if he died or not  I think he finally checked out  He checked out man  Yeah what a body of work  Wasn't he getting hot  Like mail to his home and stuff  Yeah  He got weird at the end of his life  He did radio too I think  He was doing radio in Denver or something  He had just really a shitty existence  He was always seen wearing that  Friggin floppy Gilligan hat too  Because he was just known for that  Yeah so  I fell for him man  I was like wow  And this one actor told me  He said man  You had your godfather  He said you could do anything 
[03:00:00]  You had your godfather  All actors are looking for that one thing  Like the godfather  Yeah he died in 2005  Wow  Oh well  God bless  God bless Bob Denver  Yeah you know  The moment of silence then  Legacy lives on  That's enough of a moment  It was on in reruns  We've had a lot  We've had a lot  We'll certainly talk about the new show in a second  But we've had a lot of you guys on from the wire  And Jimmy asked all you guys  Why didn't it win any awards this show?  Oh come on man  What's your answer to that? 
[03:00:30]  Yeah  For viewers who aren't looking at this wide eyed gentleman  No no no no no  Why didn't you get that?  Why didn't you get that?  Because when you tell the truth  People don't want to hear it  It's politics  And if they go ahead and give you an award  That says that what you're saying is right  The corruption is there  The drugs are there  The war against drugs is not going to win  It's not happening  Best answer we got Jimmy  Yeah  Everybody was frustrated  We had  A lot of frustration from you guys 
[03:01:00]  But this show sure won  Actually I didn't want it  I didn't want it at the end  You know  I wanted it to be clean  You know like oh man  Because if we got it at the end  Then that would have been like this just  What's the word I'm looking for?  You know  Gratuitous?  Yeah  A bullshit award  Well didn't it get a writing nomination  Or something  It was nominated for writing or something  It had one writing nomination  It's just disgusting  Like in the last  The last  Like one episode  One writer of one episode  Got nominated  And that was it 
[03:01:30]  What was your favorite season  Out of the five?  All five  All five?  One doesn't stand out  Where you really hit it?  Four?  Four was the kids  The kids  The kids  It was awesome  You've never been an examination of  You know  The dysfunction of education  And then where we lose kids  Where you either go  The right road  Or the wrong road  You know  A real example of that  Everybody's contribution  To the fucked up dynamic  I love this  I'm crazy  It's great  And so that's when you realize man 
[03:02:00]  That's why I thought the fourth season  Was just great  It was brave that they did  The docs for the second season  Yeah  Really brave  Because that first season was amazing  And then like  What the hell is this?  But honestly  I certainly like the second season  As well  But at first  You're like  Oh man  They're blowing this  That blew me out  Because I thought  I thought okay  They've seen the show  And for them  It's a black show  And that's not going to work  So let's go to the white side of town  You know  And let's do that  And I was 
[03:02:30]  Well  I had to kick myself in the ass  Because it had  Fuck all to do with that  It had to do with the whole picture  You can tell  He lives in London  Fuck all  That is right  Very British  Fuck all  You're right  Yes  Oh I'm very sorry  Fellas  Should I say fuck all  Fuck all  I mean like  You know  Piss off  Piss off  You know what I mean  Yeah  So it  It opened up  Did he say wanker  I want to see more of the projects  And all that 
[03:03:00]  And then they went to the docks  Yes  But I was all in  We were thrown by too  Yes  Absolutely  Nobody had seen  You know  A show just shift  From year to year  Like that  Well then  But now man  I tell people who  I see people who say  Man I hit it the second year  Because it threw them  And now they go back  I say just go back  Oh no it's fine  It's fine now  So it's about  The walking  To the Greek  You know  Yeah  When they kill  Fucking D'Angelo  In I think the sixth episode  Of season two  And they killed  Pretty much the lead  From season one 
[03:03:30]  Yeah  You're like wow  They don't fuck around man  That really is  The way things happen  They're not doing it  Hello  They're not giving you  And I've always said  The way Omar was killed  It was not what you wanted  As an audience member  But that is the way  The streets looked  At a drug dealer  He's just this anonymous guy  Who the wrong name  Will be put on his thing  He's meaningless  In the grand scheme of things  To me he meant something  Right  But to the cops  In real life  And they set it up  Like high noon  Like oh  Yeah  Marlo and Omar  Come on out  Motherfucker  Yeah  And then he just  I'm going to kill you 
[03:04:00]  And then all of a sudden  This little kid  Just bop  Yeah  In a convenience store  Just a kid  Yeah  And that's how it would happen  Oh I fucking  I was like  This couldn't be happening  Like this has to be  He's wearing a fucking hat  With jelly in it  Something's going on  Where they're going to make this  Fucking not real  This didn't just  Fucking canard  Did not just  Fucking end it  I was so annoyed  They didn't kill  Fucking Omar  I'm going to kill somebody  Did you have a line  In that scene  After he was killed  Just basically  Downplaying the whole  He said  Motherfucker  Motherfucker  Motherfucker 
[03:04:30]  Motherfucker  Jimmy do you remember  I can't  I actually  No I just  I just come in  It was like  Oh that's too bad  Yeah  Like a real casual  Like throw away  Like oh that's too bad  Anyway what do we got today  You know what I mean  But toss the viewers  Omar was everything  For a while  Right and Omar  Was so close to me  You know  Yeah  Because you know  That connection of  How growing up  In the same neighborhood  That same thing  One guy can go one way  One guy can go another  Your monologue was so great  A lot of people have said  It's one of the best monologues 
[03:05:00]  In the show  Was when you two  When he was sitting on the bench  And you give him the speech  Damn Jimmy  You really look at this shit  Oh yeah yeah yeah  Let me tell you  Now I gotta give props  To George Pelicanos  Because he heard me  He's a writer  Great writer  And he overheard me  Talking about  They keep shit away from us  Don't they  I'm gonna stop cursing  How do we like to curse you  You know  They keep shit away from us  On the wire  Because they don't want us to  As actors  Have an arc  Or see something coming up  And I'm like 
[03:05:30]  Where am I going  With this gun shit  You know  I was looking for the gun  That year  And it would lead me  To Omar  And then I finally  Was getting  It was getting closer to Omar  And I started talking about  Why  The research I had done  Of why I become a cop  And how  There's so many black cops  Who are from the same neighborhoods  And that's why they become cops  You know  The guys I met  Because they're like  This isn't our neighborhood  It's like 1% of the motherfuckers  I'm gonna become a cop  And change this shit  And I was telling him that story  And he walked over  And he said  Can I use some of that 
[03:06:00]  And I was like  Yeah  And so the whole idea  Of Bunk  Telling Omar  We're from the same neighborhood  Man  I don't wanna see these bodies  Man  Back in the day  We had a sense of community  Where even the thugs  Told me  You know  Hey school boy  You know  You don't belong here  Right  They had a sense  Like you're gonna do something  With your life  We're the thugs  So  But you've lost that sense  You know  So George Pelicanos  He told me last night  Motherfucker  You better tell my story  George I hope you heard this shit  Motherfucker 
[03:06:30]  That was a great  That was a very bassy  Good motherfucker  If I could say motherfucker  Like that  I would always just say it  He's got a great voice  Yeah  I haven't seen this new show  I didn't realize it was second season  No I did not know either  It's  How do you pronounce it  Treme?  Treme  Treme  It's about New Orleans  After Katrina  It takes place in 05  Can you tell us more about it  Because we really are not familiar  Yeah  Treme is  Treme  First of all  It was a neighborhood in New Orleans  Where all the culture came from  Congo Square  Where you had  You know 
[03:07:00]  Captured Africans  Enslaved  Where on Sundays  They were allowed to play their drums  And then you had the  Oom-pa-pa bands in Europe  And literally  Oom-pa-pa  And African drums  Come together  Came  Oom-pa-pa-do-ba-boom  Boom  Boom  Boom  Boom  Jazz  Literally  The birthplace of jazz  So we thought that was a great metaphor  For New Orleans  Because it's such an American art form  And all  And then they wanted to write a story  About how culture is connected  To the community  And then with the backdrop  Of just trying to survive 
[03:07:30]  After, you know  Post-Katrina  You know  So it's a story of all these people  It's kind of like Nashville  A diverse group of people  Trying to bring back their life  I play a musician  Clark plays a Mardi Gras  Indian chief  Which is, you know  Great groups in New Orleans  Who celebrate Mardi Gras  And he's like a community leader  You have a chef  You know  Kim Dickerson  You have musicians  All musicians  All kinds of musicians  From Dr. John  Wow  To Saint  Ron Carter 
[03:08:00]  Subdudes  You know  Galactica  He's been on there  Rebirth Brass Band  All that  Are they all jazz bands?  No, no, no  Rock bands  Everything  You have  We have  Bunk Rock  Cajun  Sissy Bounce  Sissy Bounce  Sissy Bounce  Man  Yeah  With this form of rap  In New Orleans  By transvestites  Holy shit  Sissy Bounce  Talking your language  I don't like transvestites  Transsexual 
[03:08:30]  The guys don't understand  There's a big difference  There's a big difference  I'm sorry  In price  Yes  So, you know  It's about culture  And about these people  Who are rebuilding their lives  After the disaster  And you know  In David Simon's hands  Of course  It's just opening up  A world  And commentary  About all sorts  Of social ills  That's gotta be nice  So at least you're working  With him again  So you know 
[03:09:00]  You have a guy  Who knows how to put  A show with integrity  Together  And doesn't go  For what's obvious  I mean at least  You have to have  That kind of security  Yeah, absolutely  You know  When you were talking  About earlier  About leaving that  To go to Hollywood  To do whatever  They do over there  You know  With David  It's not just the audience  That's getting schooled  We're getting schooled  As the actors  As those people  Telling that story  And it's just a blessing  To have this cat's words  On your paper  You know  Sometimes  You're looking at something  And you have to 
[03:09:30]  Go research it  You know  Whether it's  A person in the  Neighborhood  As is now  In Treme  Or whether it's  Like going back  To the archives  To find out  What happened legally  In some particular case  You know  Or whatever  But you know  As far as  That man's intellect  Goes  It's a blessing  I really don't want  To go anywhere else  There's enough here  To keep us all stimulated  You know  Just being in that man's mind  Is there a danger  To being on a show  That's kind of iconic  The danger is that 
[03:10:00]  You're going to get typecast  And people will all  Like you said  Gilligan  I mean  I don't think he was  A good enough actor  For real  To kind of  Separate himself  Non-disrespect  To Bob Denver  His Shakespearean work  Was never really talked about  He's lucky he was Gilligan  His Hamlet  Was fucking true  He was very lucky  He was Gilligan  But his Othello  Yeah  Where Othello came  And got off the island  Before he did  With the Globetrotters  Fucking horrible show  What a horrible  Fucking show that was  Not a laugh to be had  To be honest  We all hate Alan Hale  Sometimes 
[03:10:30]  You know  Listen  I've been  It's been called  You know  Bunk with a trombone  You know  So it's already happening  You know  People are like  Yeah yeah yeah  You know  It's the same thing  He's doing the same thing  But  Well we got a lot of fans  Checking in with this show  Let's go to Greg in New Hampshire  Greg  Oh damn  He's calling too  The hell  Hey gentlemen  What's up  Hi Greg  Hey Greg  How you doing  Hey gentlemen  Unbelievable show  Treme  The music's insanely good  And the whole storyline so far  It's just really engaging 
[03:11:00]  The only problem I have right now  Is John Goodman  Did he kill himself  Is he coming back  I wish I could tell you man  You can have to look at the whole second season to find out  He might show up somewhere in that oil slick  Who knows  We're not going to tell you  We want you to watch  But man  Thank you very much  There's so much good music on this  Because it's just  All the music is recorded live  You know  And actually the album 
[03:11:30]  The soundtrack from the first year  Was nominated for a Grammy  Damn  And I'm actually taking out  A group of musicians on tour  We're starting at  The Playboy Jazz Festival  In Hollywood  When are you all going there  I like June  You didn't tell me that shit  Yeah  Oh man  We're going to LA  San Francisco  What  Chicago  I guess you guys are friends  Yeah  DC  How do I turn this mic off  I'm going to say  Is that right  We got another  Another guy  Gak 
[03:12:00]  It looks like  Gak  What's up  Gak  Y-A-K  How you doing  All right  Yeah  What's up  Great show man  You got to watch this show  And surround sound  The audio  Not just the music  But the way it's mixed  Is phenomenal  The last episode  Takes you to  Right before the hurricane  Right  Phenomenal  Riveting  Riveting television  And I got to say  Kudos to HBO  For bringing people back  That were successful  In other shows  Putting them on other shows  And just kind of  Creating a family  You're waiting for  Somebody's Soprano guy  To show up  In somebody's other  And actually  You know that's the thing 
[03:12:30]  Thank you so much  Gak  Soprano is a very good show  And very enjoyable  That's his name  But I always thought  That the  Rules man  He thought  He thought  He thought  I was making fun of  Insulting him or something  No I wasn't  I wasn't going there  That's an insult  In the French Quarter  Yes that means  Jizz bag in the French Quarter  He don't fuck around  This guy  He's alright  Oh man  I always thought  The Soprano  Amazing show 
[03:13:00]  But the amount  Of accolades  And awards  It got  I always thought  Was irritating  When compared  With The Wire  It drove me  Again  Deserved to be nominated  It was slow man  The Wire blew it  Out of the water  It was a soap opera  And this was not  A soap opera  Every character  In The Wire  They didn't do  The typical Hollywood thing  Where you know  Every cop  Was bad  And every  They always threw  Like great scene  Is when  Fucking Bird  Is chained up  And he just won't  Stop calling 
[03:13:30]  Kima a dyke  And fucking  All the cops  Walk in  And he tears up  The fucking  The Polaroid  And you realize  That they're all about  To give this guy  A savage beating  Big Hollywood  He would buy Hollywood  In there  And fucking beat  Bubs one time  That's right  Definitely  That was so great  It's about moral  Ambiguity  You know  Yeah  It's about moral  You know  Omar is  You know  This killer  This crazed  Pathological killer  But you realize  One thing  Omar never cursed  He never cursed 
[03:14:00]  Because that was  Something he found  So offensive  I didn't realize that  I never realized that  Omar never cursed  And never killed  On Sunday  So when they went  After his grandmother  On a Sunday  He said  It's all hell  Right  They shot her hat off  That was really a mistake  That's not a hat  That's a crown  A crown  That's right  That was a crown  By the way  I thought one of the  Most hateable characters  Of The Wire  Was  I think her name  Was Delanda  In season 4  The mother  Who was encouraging  The kid to  Go  Jimmy really watched 
[03:14:30]  The show  I did  I love the show  I travel a lot  So I was  Fucking got the box sets  Oh  And that's the best way  To watch it man  One after another  One after another  One after another  But 4 and 5  I watched live  So I had to wait  I was like  That's fucking  Stinks waiting  I hate it  We had Snoop on too  I wasn't here for that  I was out  She was walking by  We realized  She wasn't acting at all  You got the real person  Yeah  There was no acting going on 
[03:15:00]  We met her in a club  When she got out of prison  Yeah  You know  Is she back in?  Michael K. Williams  Yes  She might be  I don't know  What's happening  She had a little something  Happened  She had an incident  Recently  A little incident  Yeah  She's the real deal  Holy fuck  And she has a book  Grace After Midnight  That is just her story  You know  That they're thinking about  Turning into a film  Her death scene was great too  Just asking about her hair  How my hair looked  Holy shit  Fucking great  And then they just  Pan to the back 
[03:15:30]  And you see the  Of the flash  That's right  Jimmy knows shots  He knows the shots  The blocking  Everything  I know the alley  I've been blown in it  Look out for the sissy bounce  Look out for the sissy bounce  Exactly  I parked my vehicle  In exactly the same spot  Yeah  The death scenes 
[03:16:00]  In that show  Every one of them  Meant something  And every one of them  You're like  Oh god  Was that well done  Sopranos too  The Sopranos had some great  I thought when  Sharipa got killed  By in the trains  Oh yeah  That was a fantastic scene  When  Dre got killed  Andrea  What was her name  Oh fuck yeah  The girl in the woods  The girl in the woods  Crawling away  Yeah  Oh man  As they just walk past camera  He's pulling out the gun  Yeah  Yeah  Goodbye  Goodbye  They didn't show it on the screen though  No  Exactly 
[03:16:30]  There was a lot of stuff  That wasn't  Brilliant  Prop Joe  They didn't show his murder  On the screen either  What did they show  They show Marlo's face  They pulled away  Prop Joe  It was a really creepy scene  You just told him  Breathe  Breathe  Yeah  Breathe  And that sociopath face  Doesn't change  It doesn't change  And that's the nicest guy  That's the thing  We had him on  Jamie  The actors on the wire  We got to see them last night  Man  They were such great actors  Because they're the total opposite 
[03:17:00]  Of who they are  Michael K. Williams  Who played Omar  He couldn't be a nicer guy  And Jamie Hector  Man is just  Such a sweetheart  Man  But sometimes  When you're talking to him  Jamie say  How you doing Wendell  You okay man  And the next thing you know  You're shitting yourself  I wonder  Where that shit goes from  Why you so nice to me Jamie  I owe you money  There's got to be one prick  On the whole cast  That we just haven't met yet  Because everyone we've met  Has been nice  We had him 
[03:17:30]  We had  I don't know how to say his name  Bangay  Banga  Banga  Yeah he was one of the nicest guys  All of them have been nice  There's got to be  We haven't had Dominic West on  He's probably the best  We'll get it  He's on now  You found out  Dominic  I hope you're listening  Yeah he's a real dick  You guys just sold me  On the new show  Yeah of course  I would see that  Just because you guys  Go alone  I gotta check it out  And listen  The DVD of the first season  Just came out  So it's one of those shows  Where you can just pop it in  Try to get back to you  Roland get me a copy  Immediately  Roland  Roland gets me the 
[03:18:00]  Yeah the shows  Yeah that's fantastic  I'm ready for stuff  You guys are very cool  I'll come back again  After you've seen it  Because I will  I will absolutely see it  But if you're a music fan  Man you're gonna love it  You're gonna love it  I like to think I am  You know  It's across the board  So much good music  HBO sticks with a show  When they know  It's got something  Which I kind of like  About them  As opposed to ones  That are ratings driven  Like I mean  It might do great numbers  I don't know  But they don't seem to  Concentrate on the integrity  Of the show a lot more  Which is nice  Because even though 
[03:18:30]  The Wire didn't get  It got critical acclaim  But it didn't get awards  They just stuck with it  I think  Because they knew  It was  Although it was under promoted  This is what I'm saying  About intelligent television  You know  Because people  They like thinking  You know  And I live in London  This show in London  The Wire in London  Blew it  The whole island  Out the water  Oh really  They love it  You can't go  It was just insane  And you think  Well this is America  No this is really  The western world  All of these systems 
[03:19:00]  Are breaking on down  Look what's happening  With the education  Here in the states  And also in England  At this point in time  So smart TV  Is what we want  You know  We don't want to be  Anesthetized all the time  Sometimes we like to be  We like to be  Anesthetized  But for the moment  Like we want to be  Really smart  And have to say  Come on us  You know what I mean  So it's really nice  To be part of a team  Or be part of  On that side  Where  We are a service 
[03:19:30]  Where art  Is actually serving  The public  As it's supposed to do  Not just a commodity  On the fucking show  Right  You take off  And you look at  And you eat  And you throw it away  Well they  No  They like when it  Wraps up neatly  At the end  And that's  That's what this show  Didn't always do  And you know  I'll say  Because these guys  Are probably too smart  And nice to say it  But how it stinks  I'm sorry  That fucking  Gimp  Solving the fucking  Health issues  Winning awards  Makes me sick  To my stomach  What show is that  House  The fact that that  Wins dramatic awards 
[03:20:00]  Fucking beat it  Quirky fucking guy  With a limp  Fuck you  Beat it  Stupid  It drives me nuts  That that shit  Is considered great  Fucking entertainment  Weekly people  Yeah  It really  Well people  You know  The mainstream  Are just going to be  Attracted to the  Mindless  Fucking potato chip  Television  I think it's because  They don't know  They haven't had a choice  No I think it's because  The majority of people  Are stupid  I mean you know 
[03:20:30]  I've been  I've traveled around  For a while  America  I did not say  Been around a few years  I did not say that  America  I think you're all  Very very smart  And full of potential  So watch Treme  And The Wire  I'll never forget man  You ever be with a woman  And it's like  You know  That jaywalking shit  You know  And they put a picture  Of you know  Winston Churchill  You know  And you with this  Fine woman  She goes  Who the fuck is that  What  You really don't know  Who that is  Damn  I'm going to have to  Take these handcuffs  Off you 
[03:21:00]  I just lost it  No that's the reaction  I want  I don't want a chick  Who knows Churchill  If I'm just going to fuck her  You want a chick  That looks like Churchill  I don't need a fucking  Brainiac  That's what you want to hear  When your dick is out  And Churchill comes up  Who's that  Exactly  Exactly  What do you want  To fucking pull her head up 
[03:21:30]  And start quoting him  God damn it  To date someone though  I agree  If you're going to date  Or you want to fall in love  You probably want somebody  Really smart  Yeah a little bit of  Compelling conversation  It's nice every so often  With a sister girl  In the alley  In the back of the car  Right right  An alleged girl  An alleged girl  Exactly  Look a lot of women  Are 6'4 with very thin calves  We were just commenting  And deep voices  Hey Jimmy  How you doing  He's heard that  I made the error 
[03:22:00]  What are you going to do  What are you going to do  You go hey  I'm all in right now  I'm all in  You know  I'll just pretend  I went to customer service  They pulled a box cutter on me  They all carry razors  Dipped in garlic  Apparently  Jimmy's very educated  Yeah on that  I really am  He knows the world  Our show is ending  What time is this  We end at 10 o'clock  Wow we actually went  10 minutes late today  We never do that  We never do that  Unless we have a good guest 
[03:22:30]  So the show is  Could we just literally  Sit here and just talk  About The Wire  For like hours  That's all I would do  Is just talk about The Wire  And you know  Well now we got to start  Talking about this new show  We got to start  Tremé  Tremé  Tremé is on HBO  Sunday nights at 10 o'clock  Season 2 premieres  This Sunday  It premieres this Sunday  And it takes place in 2005  It's three months after Katrina  And it's obviously  That's when it starts  In the second season  It's 14 months  So it's a year later  Oh season 1 started  Yeah  But you know  HBO is running right now  Like a marathon of Tremé  The first season 
[03:23:00]  So you'll be able  Is it on demand  Yes  Yeah  Okay  Yes  Yeah  I love the on demand  Boom  I watch it when I want to watch it  I might have to do a marathon  Do a marathon  It's the best way to do it  And then once you get caught up  Like Jimmy said  You're pissed off  You're like  Fuck  That was the last one  You get excited  When you've got 10 still  You know  It starts counting down  Like ah shit  I have trouble getting into  A new series  I literally  I went through like  A post wire  I can't commit to anybody  Boardwalk Empire 
[03:23:30]  Was pretty good  I kind of got into that  And I enjoyed that  You know  Because you know  Michael Williams is in it  So I was like  Alright  And this I'll watch now  But I can't get into  Another series  It's tough  Yeah  I'm not interested  We're going to give it a shot  With this one  That's for sure  This I'll watch  Well let's thank  Clark Peters and Wendell Pierce  Man  Yeah thanks guys  Thank you  We love you guys man  We really do  We'll have you back  After where you've seen  A bunch of these  Yeah  I feel bad we haven't seen it  Nah that's alright  That means you're going  To check it out  There's two types  Of wire fans like that too  People who know  Every shot like Jimmy 
[03:24:00]  You know  And other people who go  I've never seen a minute of it  What happens is  The wire then lives on  And on and on  And on and on  In boxes  Just a last question  Do you guys notice  That you get  Like I did something  With Dominic Lombardozzi  We did a thing together  And the way the other actors  Treated him on this set  It was a TED dance  It was for Bored to Death  No matter who the actor was  They worshipped the guy  From the fucking wire  Like he came in  With a weird glow  And everybody on the set  Wanted to talk to him  Because he was a part of that 
[03:24:30]  So the other actors  It's got to be nice  That they're giving you  They have to treat you  Different  It's great  It's great  You know  They really  Just  First of all  They're like  Man I wish I was on it  With you  That's a good gig  That would be great  That was a great gig  That's a great one  To have on a resume  Hell yeah  I don't wish I was on it  Because I would have ruined it  Of course you would have  I would have spoiled the wire  With my fucking awful acting  Hey you drug addict  Exactly  Give me a needle please  Oh  Stink sham  Yeah I would have fucking  Completely blown it 
[03:25:00]  Is this guy really running  For president  Ah there you are  Oh please  It's a joke  But for some reason  The media make him believe  The only thing is  The GOP hasn't come up  With anyone else yet  So he's like the one  And especially  The Democratic Party  Is really trying to portray him  As that's your guy  That's the front runner  You know  That's your front runner  That's what you want  Trump is going  Laughing all the way to the bank  He's laughing  He knows he's not running  You're going to see  Why is he saying  My film in this  He was  Maybe he ran out of tape  Or something  Tape  Or maybe  What the hell is this  Well 
[03:25:30]  It's just a way to say it  I don't know  He ran out of fucking time  I think he does  I think he does have tape  In that one though  Alright  So why are you laughing at me  Digital card camera  I wasn't laughing  I was like tape  I'm laughing at the camera  Oh  Jesus  Why do we have a camera  With a tape  It's a big old  So we videotaped  We make sure we got  The whole fucking  The environmentalist in  Yeah right  Fucking snooze fest  That guy was  We get it  I liked solar panels  It was awful  I started snoring
