<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts discussing the treacherous snowy conditions in New York City, recounting their perilous commutes.  One host, Dan, arrived with a large head wound from a minor car accident caused by the city's inadequate snow removal. This led to a discussion about the city's decline, citing reduced advertising, increased homelessness (illustrated with a photograph of a homeless man eating from a dumpster), fewer police officers, and a comparison between the Giuliani and subsequent mayoral administrations.  They also discussed John Montone, a local news reporter known for repeating interviewees' final phrases, and his on-air scolding of a reckless driver.

The show then covered the disturbing news story of a man who faxed and called a news station to announce his intention to kill his family and himself, before doing so. The hosts expressed shock and disgust at the event.  The conversation shifted to the lack of hype surrounding the upcoming Super Bowl and a perceived general societal decline, comparing it to the technological shifts of the early 20th century, mentioning the decline of newspapers and changes in communication habits.  They also noted athletes' struggles due to the economic climate and discussed their own families' struggles adapting to modern technology. The show further touched upon President Obama's early policies, specifically the stimulus package, and the failure of their large studio television due to a costly power supply issue. One host shared a story about his girlfriend's laptop crashing and losing three years of data, highlighting the importance of data backups.  A picture of Dan's head injury was later shared on social media.

A subsequent segment focused on a host's wife's laptop hard drive crash, resulting in the loss of three years of irretrievable data.  After initial recovery attempts failed, a friend managed to temporarily restore the data before another crash. This led to a discussion of data backup methods, specifically Apple's Time Machine.  The segment also featured a series of misdirected text messages between Steve and his girlfriend, revealing intimate details of their relationship, which the hosts hilariously recounted. Comedian Adam Ferrara was a guest, discussing his engagement, his unconventional wedding plans at an old military academy, and his role in *Mall Cop*.  The hosts and Jimmy Norton also criticized Steve Martin's recent *Pink Panther* films, speculating on why other comedians haven't voiced similar criticisms.  Jimmy Norton's recent appearances on *Red Eye* were also mentioned, alongside listener calls and another on-air personality, Danny, sharing a picture of his car accident injury on Twitter.

A further segment with Adam Ferrara focused on his experiences in the entertainment industry, his dating life, and the hosts' own experiences, frequently using crude and sexually explicit language. They reminisced about their past band experiences and exploits with women.  Technical difficulties with the show's audio equipment were a recurring theme. Ferrara promoted his Gotham Comedy Club appearances, and the conversation included movie reviews of *Revolutionary Road*, *Benjamin Button*, *Slumdog Millionaire*, and *Frost/Nixon*, often laced with humorous and offensive comments. A caller, Bruce, expressed appreciation for Ferrara and a term he coined.  Discussions also included a missing TV in the studio and upcoming changes to their broadcast space, concluding with continued technical issues.

Another segment praised the British version of *The Office*, dissecting scenes and comparing it to the American version, particularly criticizing its later seasons and comparing the decline to that of *All in the Family*.  The segment included advertisements for AshleyMadison.com and ProFlowers.com, with inappropriate banter.  Adam Ferrara was again a guest, discussing his roles in *Rescue Me* and *Mall Cop*.  The hosts and callers discussed video game consoles, particularly the Xbox 360's "Red Ring of Death" error.  Extensive casual conversation incorporated many offensive terms and jokes.

The final segment featured the hosts and Jimmy Norton discussing personal dissatisfaction, using graphic language. Norton recounted a party anecdote involving a friend's gun collection.  The discussion shifted to a rumor about Adam Carolla's alleged marijuana use (which he denied), personal anxieties, and Carolla's perceived lack of Black friends, prompting a lengthy, contentious, and often offensively worded discussion about his social circles, racial dynamics, and the nature of friendship.  The discussion included several offensive racial slurs and stereotypes.  The conversation concluded with personal anecdotes, a humorous song about Barack Obama, a discussion about a lawn jockey, an argument about the causes of the Civil War, and disparaging comments about club owner Greg Charles.  The segment ended with the Obama song.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Ah!  Hi!  The gang is strolling in?  All sorts of issues this morning here in New York City.  Yes.  It's snowy, it's icy.  Can I have a phone screen, please?  Uh-oh. What happened here?  What happened?  It's possible. Usually I get, uh, I can see who's on the phone, but... 
[00:00:30]  I don't know what to touch.  I'm a retard!  Is it a button?  Yeah.  All right, we'll fix it, uh, next, you know, during the break or something.  I don't need it. I don't need it right now.  It's just more of a convenience than, uh, a necessity for me.  Hi, Jimmy!  Jimmy!  Jimmy, it's cold out.  It's, uh, yeah, we've had car crashes today.  Uh, people had to take trains instead of jumping their cars. 
[00:01:00]  People were strolling in.  I had to get in early.  And had to get in early to be responsible.  Oh!  I guess, what, the snow is north and west of the city?  Yeah, but, uh...  I know it's snowing here in Manhattan. I'm not stupid, but it's a lot worse north and west.  Yeah, and here's the deal.  I think, uh, for the majority of the rush hour, by that time it's going to be okay.  But we're kind of like the pioneers whenever there's these early morning snowstorms.  So, and we all take different modes of transportation.  Some walk. 
[00:01:30]  Right.  Some take the subways.  Some take cabs.  Yeah.  I drive, you know, a pretty good distance from Long Island.  And so we all have a little smorgasbord of what it's like in those circumstances.  Um, uh, I, I actually drove like a human being today.  Pretty civilized.  Uh, and it was really treacherous.  Uh, out there.  Even in, in what I like to call the SUV lane.  Which is the get out of the left lane if you're in a Toyota.  Get the F out of the way lane.  Just get out of the way.  If you want to drive and plow into a wall. 
[00:02:00]  But you're a responsible driver when it's snowing and icing.  You know, you're slowing it down and stuff a little bit.  Yeah, I'm like 70.  Yeah, you know, that's slow.  I take it easy.  Yeah, absolutely.  But I, I like your observation that we're pioneers.  Yeah, we're pioneers.  We're the ones that have the first footsteps in the snow if we walk to work.  Danny was talking about driving and he, he's like, I pull out onto the road and I'm the first set of tire tracks.  I'm the guy.  Someone has to start this.  Yeah, I did that this morning as I'm pulling down to the first stop sign, which is kind of on a downhill.  Yeah.  So, you know, you kind of tap the brakes. 
[00:02:30]  You make sure you're not going to slide right down the hill through the intersection.  I'm looking and going, there's no tire tracks.  There hasn't been tire tracks.  Like, I'm the first guy to drive down this and test this crap out.  You ever drive down a street like that and realize, oh my God, I'm on the sidewalk.  Yeah, you have no idea where anything is really.  Yeah, you have no idea.  That happened on the expressway because the expressway was completely covered in snow.  Right.  And people just, they can't quite gauge where the lanes are.  Yeah.  And I'm looking at the guy next to me and he's got the, he's got the dotted white lines like right in the middle of his car for some lane or another. 
[00:03:00]  I'm in the HOV lane, but he's so far over into the left lane that I think I'm on the shoulder.  Yeah.  Of the HOV lane, I have no idea.  Between like three and six, it's make your own lane.  Make your own lanes.  They can't pull you over for that.  Make your own way.  Yeah, you're a pioneer.  That's it.  That's a great way to look at it.  And we got John Montone as a fan of the show.  He does.  John Montone. 
[00:03:30]  He does street stuff for Wins here in New York.  Yeah, local news station.  He was scolding some guy.  He was using the radio station to scold, to yell at some dude.  I listen to Wins on the way in, get my news, you know, and traffic and weather and things like that.  And John Montone is the guy that they send out.  He's the guy on the street.  We've had him on the show before.  And he has this voice, and his ending, his little tag on all of his stories is whatever the guy that he's interviewing just said. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  It's like, well, it's going to be a tough drive.  A tough drive.  Indeed.  Yeah.  Throws in one of those dumb words at the end.  You know, we're just going to have to suck it up and get ourselves to work.  Suck it up and get ourselves to work.  Indeed.  But he didn't do that today.  Right.  Today he goes, and to the pinhead in the red Honda, who was doing 70 in the right lane passing tractor trailers, 
[00:04:30]  hey, buddy, if you're still alive, slow down.  He actually said if you're still alive.  He reprimanded someone on the air.  I was dying.  John Montone's a dick.  No.  John Montone rules.  I listen every day.  Yeah, we like him.  It was all right.  It was so funny to hear him calling someone out.  Hey, buddy.  Pinhead.  Pally.  He said pinhead, bud.  Hey, you f***ing f***.  Nice.  So, there you go. 
[00:05:00]  Made it in.  Yeah, well, somebody's got a little red raspberry on their noggin.  If you look over there.  Wait, that's from this morning, Dan?  You think it was from?  Yeah.  Well, why are you here?  Because I'm all right.  What happened, Dan?  Look at his head.  He was in a car accident on the way in.  Yeah, nothing like snow.  Nothing like the city preparing for a snowstorm with no salt and no plows on the street.  Well, they got to wait for it to snow for a while.  No, you know what it is?  The city's broke. 
[00:05:30]  Everyone's broke.  It used to be there would be sanders and plows out when the first flurry came down,  when everybody was doing well.  Now, I hit that New York City line on the expressway.  They might as well have just drawn it with someone's foot in the snow because it was that obvious.  You hit it, and all of a sudden, nothing was plowed or salted.  They should have a huge sign, you're on your own.  Yeah.  You're on your own.  Good luck.  To be honest, I've never, like, I mean, I've lived in New York my entire life, so I've seen plenty of snowstorms. 
[00:06:00]  I've never seen the roads so poorly planned for.  And there's not a lot of snow on the ground.  There really isn't.  But there's nothing.  They didn't salt?  No salt, no plows.  Because they usually throw that salt down early.  They do do that.  Dude, we used to make fun of how they would say, like, oh, my God, there's going to be this big snowstorm.  And before the first, like, flake came down, the salters are out there.  The news is talking to the salting trucks.  Today, nothing.  Ungats, as my relatives used to say. 
[00:06:30]  Like, the main highways, like, aren't so bad because there's, you know, traffic here and there.  So, like, the car's, you know, trudging through.  It just kind of makes it, like, slushy and wet, which is no big deal.  But it's those little roads, like, where you have to, like, get off a highway that merges onto another highway.  And there was, you know, there's not a lot of traffic on those little roads like that.  So there was nothing there.  I think I was the first set of tire treads.  And that's exactly why I lost it.  And then the second set is the guy that's laughing at which way the first set are going, hey, look at those tire treads.  Wow.  I didn't think a car could move in that direction like that. 
[00:07:00]  I was ice skating.  Do you ever try to figure out how the car, you're like, wait a minute, I'm seeing four tire tracks.  How do you make a squiggly line like that with a car?  Well, I had to figure out how.  It's like spirography.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  There you go.  I had to figure out how, like, once I figured out, like, once my car started, because I thought I was going to have to call a tow charter.  So once it started, I had to figure out how I was going to get back on the road and not get into a car accident again.  Because I was completely turned, like, the other way at this point.  So I had to try to maneuver my car.  So, like, how fast were you going? 
[00:07:30]  Not fast at all.  Probably.  Was it one of those slow motion crashes we've all experienced?  Absolutely.  Well, you watch it happen for a good 30 seconds.  Like, ah, I know I'm hitting something.  Yeah, stop right.  Yeah, I'm going to be in a little late.  Yeah.  No, I'm having an accident.  No, no, I haven't had it yet.  It's happening.  But there's nothing else I could do.  Yeah.  What do you do?  Turn into the skid.  Yeah.  And I'm still going.  All right, I'll call you after I crash.  It's one of those situations where there's nothing else you could do. 
[00:08:00]  You just got to wait for the impact.  That's exactly what it was, too.  That sucks.  Like, I was on the highway maybe doing, like, 40, 45.  Like, I was taking it nice and easy.  And then, like, you know, I get off to get onto that, like, little service road, sort  of, of the LIE.  And right as I get off, because there was, you know, no plows, no nothing.  So right as I got off, just started skidding immediately.  And it's slow.  Like I said, so I was only doing, so now I'm slowing down from 40.  You know?  Feel it go right.  Feel it go left.  I'm doing that little, okay, I'll go with, you know, I'll go right with my wheel, then 
[00:08:30]  left with the wheel.  I knew it was coming from a mile away.  So, you know, I just pretty much braced for impact and tried to do the least amount of  damage to my car when I hit the car.  And your head.  It is a nice and shiny red there.  That is.  You got to take a picture of that and pop it up.  Yeah, we'll put it up on onaradio.com.  So, uh, I wasn't going to ask you.  No seatbelt?  Uh, no, but it wouldn't have, I still would have hit my head.  How?  How?  It was on, like, the lip of where the sunroof is.  Like, you know how there's, like, that little piece of car ceiling?  Yeah, but doesn't the shoulder belt hold you down as well as? 
[00:09:00]  Well, you know what it was?  I was up.  I knew it was going to happen, right?  So, like, I'm in the seat and I'm kind of, like, bracing.  You know, like, I wasn't, like.  So, I put my head through the sunroof and closed it around my neck.  Well, what I did, I just.  I was as straight, like, I tried to make myself as straight as possible and as far back into  the seat as possible.  Boy, you did have time.  Dude, I told you.  It went on forever.  Like, I'm sitting, I'm bracing for impact.  Like, I thought about it, like, four times as it's happening.  I'm like, you know, I just bought this car a month ago.  Yeah.  And, like, that's all that's going through my head. 
[00:09:30]  And, like, I know I'm crashing.  And, like, I had the time to think about how I wanted to crash.  How bad's the damage?  Yeah, how much damage?  It's bad enough, man.  Is it?  Like, yeah, I'll need a new bumper.  Bumper.  You don't need a bumper.  Headlights, all right?  You know what?  Surprisingly, it hit just under.  So, my headlight actually made it.  I just drive around like that.  Who cares?  Yeah, but you know what?  Like a goddamn b****.  That's right.  You can't.  That's right.  It wouldn't bother me so much if I didn't just get the car, like, literally four weeks ago.  Yeah.  Jeez.  And it's not even a nice car, and it's probably the nicest car I've ever had. 
[00:10:00]  So, it's just like, you know what I'm saying?  Like, it's a 10-year-old car, and it's the nicest thing I've ever driven.  That sucks.  By the way, the tow truck guys are calling.  They're out there.  We know you're out there, just not as many as we're used to seeing.  All right, let's acknowledge that.  Because, like, hey, big fan, I'm playing right now.  We're out here.  Shut it.  We were talking about before the fact where the Salters were out there.  Yeah.  We know the city's cutting the budget to crap.  There's an article in the paper today about the fear that New York City's going to go back to the 70s. 
[00:10:30]  The New York City of the 70s, as we all remember, was just a paradise.  If you were a pimp, a hoe, a drug dealer, a drug addict, muggers, you know, Giuliani, when we were prosperous,  turned New York City into what it turned into, which was a great tourist attraction, one of the safest cities to visit.  You're not one of those guys that believe that one guy makes all the difference in the world, do you?  I mean, you're not one of those, right? 
[00:11:00]  I think it always comes down to the economy, and then the guy happens to be in that position at the right time.  Right.  You need the guy, but you also need the circumstance.  But it's not fair that Giuliani gets all that credit, because the economy was just amazing.  The economy had been good under other administrations, and then just, you know, we were coming out of a lot of crap financially when Dinkins got in,  and he just wasn't the guy to instate a lot of the things that Giuliani did.  Giuliani did a great job of cleaning up New York City.  Whether you like it now or don't, crime is at the lowest it's ever been. 
[00:11:30]  It's coming back up now.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Coming back is crime to New York City.  A little bit.  Yeah.  But as far as, you know, a quality of life, they called it, those things, they really did help, because it brought tourism back.  People weren't afraid to come to New York.  It brought businesses in.  And now people are afraid it's going to go back, because the city's broke.  I don't know who's, like, glazing this over.  Bloomberg's kind of like, well, we need to do this, or we're going to have problems. 
[00:12:00]  We're in the decay right now.  No, not yet.  They put a paint job on the whole city.  Did they?  Hoping people aren't going to notice yet.  You know what you notice?  You put a nice, fresh coat of paint on everything.  You notice the paint peeling is what you notice.  You also notice, look at billboards.  You see ads for movies that came out in the summer.  Dude, I'm glad you said that.  It means that they're not selling ad space.  Wait, I was in a cab yesterday on the way home.  There was one of those tour buses advertising the Christmas show.  Yeah.  And I'm like, wow. 
[00:12:30]  I was thinking the exact same thing.  I'm like, man, ad dollars are way down.  If they can't find another client for this bus, it still has Santa Claus on the side.  Ad dollars down.  And I've noticed, which is a good thing also, not as many cops on the road just sitting there waiting to ticket you.  I guess there's more profitable things they could be doing.  I don't know.  Or they just cut them back so much.  That's good for us.  I think they're just giving tickets from the stupid ticket people, not the real cops. 
[00:13:00]  It's just a lot of these little things you start seeing and going, uh-uh.  Well, you said that you saw a guy with a rag the other day.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's a side.  Yep, guy.  He had a rag in his hand.  Starts, um.  Spitting on it to clean your windshield.  They just started wiping some guy's window down.  Mine?  Excuse me.  No.  Never happened.  They know.  They know four cars away not to come near my car.  And I have, like, heavy things in my car to throw at them.  I'll throw it right at their face and then speed away like a coward. 
[00:13:30]  Of course.  But at least I'll get my shot in.  Yeah, yeah.  But, no, this guy started, like, wiping a guy's window down.  And then he goes to the driver's side and puts his hand off for change.  It's like, you know.  You know what Rudy used to do?  He used to ride around in a black SUV.  He would have guys take him around at night, unmarked.  No one knew it was the mayor.  And he would have these guys take him around the city.  And he would see what was really going on.  Yeah.  And he would point out what he wanted done.  But he really saw it close.  Why doesn't the governor do that?  Oh, no.  Oh, damn it.  Oh, boy. 
[00:14:00]  No.  I want to apologize to the governor of New York.  He did, actually.  They tied him to the roof with a piece of luggage.  Just peeked around and yelled, what's happening?  There's more homeless out there.  Yeah, yeah.  In my neighborhood, not a lot.  But you're starting to see, like, businesses closing down.  Yep.  Not a lot.  But just here.  Like, it's sprinkled right now.  Doesn't happen overnight.  You're like, bing, bing over here.  And all of a sudden, graffiti.  I don't know why that happens.  You close your doors, graffiti the next day. 
[00:14:30]  Doesn't happen overnight.  Why don't the graffiti people just do it while the business is still in business?  I never understood that.  Then they cover it up real quick.  You think?  Yeah.  You want your tag up there for a while.  Yeah.  What's yours?  OP Radio on Twitter.  Oh, good one.  Actually, I took a picture of a guy, a homeless guy.  I don't even know if my picture did it justice.  I was at the Red Eye Grill having a really nice lunch.  And I look out the window, and I'm like, wow, there is a homeless guy. 
[00:15:00]  And we've all seen the homeless guy go into the garbage and try to find some stuff.  And usually they put it in their bag and they walk away.  This guy was in full chow mode.  Just munching.  I mean, full chow mode.  Just munching.  In the garbage.  Yes.  Yes.  That's a life-size rat.  Yes.  That's a rat man.  And all the business people, because it's midtown, they're just walking by like it's nothing.  They've seen it all in this town.  But this guy, full, just scooping with his hand. 
[00:15:30]  It was some kind of, it had to be some kind of Chinese food or something.  And just shoveling it into his, uh...  You know what the trouble is?  You're in a dumpster an hour later.  Ah!  Ah, da, da.  Ah, cha, cha, cha.  But, uh, and I'm seeing more of that.  Yep.  You know?  It's the slow...  Just a little bit.  A little bit.  The granules coming off the sides of the buildings when you're walking down.  The slow decay.  The, the, you know, that's what happens.  Right now is a very interesting time. 
[00:16:00]  Uh, we, we gotta, we gotta recover from this kind of pronto, or things are gonna, we're  looking at some kind of class, uh, uh, conflict or, um, a complete breakdown of our inner cities.  You better have room for me and my girl, because if, if this city goes back to the late 70s,  I'm, I'm running out of here scared.  Dude, you ever see that twilight zone where the guy builds the bomb shelter and, uh, all  the neighbors laugh at him and then there's an, that's gonna be me.  All right, good.  No, you're gonna be knocking and, and I'm gonna be, no, but I only have, there's so much 
[00:16:30]  ammunition and food.  I thought you would at least, uh, you know, invite me in before you close everyone else  out.  No, that's the point.  I wanna make the cut.  And then you break the door down and I give everyone a speech.  I wanna make the cut.  Who was, remember the headline, the famous headline in the post, what was it, when Ford was president  and basically told New York, drop dead was the quote, that's right.  Ford Charles, New York, drop dead.  What year was that, like 77?  Yeah.  We're not, it's not gonna get that bad, is it?  Mm.  And who was the mayor back then?  Uh, Lindsey?  Was it Mayor Lindsey? 
[00:17:00]  I think it was before 77.  Really?  Yeah.  Like 70?  I think Carter was in 77.  Wow, good job, Danny.  Carter was in 77.  73?  Yeah, that was early.  That was 73.  Does that look until 73?  I think it was Mayor Lindsey was in.  Ford?  75?  75, about?  Ford to sit.  Wait, put that headline up again.  It's one of the most famous newspaper headlines in New York history.  Uh, it says Ford to City, drop dead.  Yeah, uh, City was asking for federal money.  Yeah.  Because it was broke. 
[00:17:30]  And Gerald Ford said, eh, he ain't gonna dine.  Vows, he'll veto any bailout.  Yep.  Abe Carey, rip stand.  Stock skid down.  Is that a beam?  Dow down, wow.  Look at this.  Stock skid.  Dow down 12.  Wow.  Dow down 12.  And that's a stock skid.  Oh, my.  Would we take that?  That was like 5%, probably.  Would we take the Dow being down 12? 
[00:18:00]  When it moves, no one cares.  Like, ah, it's even today.  We would take it down 12 for the next 60 straight days.  It doesn't matter.  It would be.  Dow sly wall 12.  Well, holy Jesus.  I guess they were working in fractions back then, huh?  I'm in the money today.  We went up 6 points.  That was up 6 cents today.  We're in a good place.  Jeez.  That's old.  Yeah.  Jeez.  All right.  Just warming up here.  877-212-ONA.  So we got the snowy day here in New York.  And it's funny when we talk about the weather here in New York, because we're a national. 
[00:18:30]  Actually, we're all over the world.  I mean, you know.  Yes.  Here and there.  We don't have a ton of listeners in places like Hawaii or I know people who listen in Japan and England.  But they're here and there.  Yeah.  But we have a nice.  The Netherlands.  The Netherlands.  We have a nice-sized audience across America.  And when we talk weather here, they're like, shut up.  Yeah.  We got ice storms in the Midwest.  Well, this is also, yeah, this is stuff that was blown over from the Midwest.  And they really got creamed with ice and stuff. 
[00:19:00]  We're not going to even get what they said, though.  It's going to turn over to rain by the afternoon.  We never get so.  I know.  We get one real deal storm every year.  Maybe.  Maybe.  All right.  Let's take a break and we'll continue.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, good morning to everybody.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  A lot of cars off the road this morning as I watch local TV here in New York City.  No one wants to be out there.  Uh-uh.  What happened with that jet, Anthony?  You were telling me they gave it back. 
[00:19:30]  Well, apparently it's been on order for a while.  The city group decided to, what, buy a $50 million jet?  Yeah, it's a lovely jet.  Also, they went and bought French.  They didn't even decide, you know, perhaps they should buy something.  They said, screw America.  Boeing or something.  Yeah.  But, yeah, they bought a French jet.  And it was, they ordered it a few years before this whole breakdown of the-  Oh, then what's the big deal then?  Well, the big deal is now things are bad, so don't take the jet. 
[00:20:00]  But do they pay for the jet already and they're just waiting for it?  They put a big deposit down on the jet, which I guess is non-refundable.  But think of the company that built the jet for them and gets like, hey, you know that's  $50 million?  Yeah.  Or the guy that sold it, that got his commission and spent it.  Sacre bleu!  Well, now that all eyes are on them, they decided they're not going to buy this thing, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  That would be pretty smart.  But this is the stuff that you can't keep an eye on these guys, and the mentality behind 
[00:20:30]  it is just something that will be perpetuated with the banking industry.  They don't seem to understand that this government bailout wasn't just a business-as-usual thing.  It's, you've got to get your ass in line.  You know, you've got to fix what was busted that brought us to this point.  No more spa retreats for everybody?  No more spa retreats, no more of these things.  They spent money like it was never going to run out. 
[00:21:00]  And, ooh, damn, it went elsewhere.  So, yeah, this jet was the latest in the faux pas of some of these companies that have been  getting bailouts.  And, yeah, they had to give it back.  I was just looking for an excuse to play Jay Leno for last night.  Well, last night we talked about how Citigroup took $50 million of the bailout money we gave  and they bought the corporate jet.  Remember we talked about this last night?  Well, Citigroup now says today they were not going to take possession of it.  They said they're going to lose money on it because they put a huge deposit on it, but 
[00:21:30]  they now realize it was a mistake.  They said it was the most overpriced jet since Brett Favre.  They couldn't believe it.  Oh.  Good joke.  Good for Jay.  Joke aside, Citigroup, it's amazing when you're getting beat up publicly.  It's like if this show gets a lot of crap, the heat from the corporate lawyers comes on.  Nobody wants it.  The president was criticizing Citigroup.  Yeah.  Leno.  How many millions of people watch Leno and you're just getting your teeth kicked in by him? 
[00:22:00]  They're like, all right, we won't take the jet.  Yeah, all right.  Cancel the jet.  Damn it.  Shame them.  That's all that works.  And you know, they were probably like behind those big closed doors just going, by the  way, we went with the leather seats on the jet.  We got the little wet bar in there.  Can't wait.  They're telling like what they're going to do with the jet story.  We're going to fly down to the Super Bowl.  We're going to do this.  Wait.  The president said what?  No jet?  And then they showed in the paper today, they showed a couple of the Wall Street executives 
[00:22:30]  dining at McDonald's.  Really?  Yeah.  A couple of these Wall Street bigwigs having a little filet of fish.  Yeah, but that's McDonald's.  Everyone likes McDonald's, though.  You know what?  Why are they making a big deal out of that?  Because a lot of these guys take these two-hour lunches at these, if you've been down to Wall  Street, it's loaded with these pub restaurants that are just packed with these Wall Street  guys.  I've been in there when I was having my episodes in court. 
[00:23:00]  I'd go into some of these bars afterwards, and they're packed with Wall Street guys, and  they're eating and drinking and having a great time, and there they are at lunch.  There's two guys just sitting at some hard McDonald's seat with a filet of fish, just  shoving it in their mouths until they have to go pack and try to scrape up some caps.  Come on.  You really think they're penny-pitching?  Dude.  Pitching?  It's a great photo.  I think they are.  To the point where they're going to McDonald's instead of...  I think it's...  Getting their $100 lunches?  I think it's bad.  McDonald's reported their earnings just two days ago, and they had an 80% increase in 
[00:23:30]  earnings, and they say it's all due to their $1 meal, because nobody can afford...  Yeah, people are definitely eating cheaper out there, but McDonald's...  But the Wall Street guys?  Come on.  Come on.  I'm calling Bravo Sierra.  A little bit of Bravo Sierra?  I don't know.  I think these guys just like McDonald's.  Who doesn't?  All right.  It could be.  I don't know.  It's still a great photo op.  Yeah, it's one of those, you know...  You like to think it's real, right?  And they kind of look like they're skulking.  Yeah.  They look like they're skulking. 
[00:24:00]  Because some ass has a camera in their face going, hey, look at you.  You can't afford a real lunch.  Just being...  Yeah, what happened to you, lobster and flamboyant?  You got filet-o-fish and a cheeseburger now, pally.  Filet-o-fish and cheeseburger indeed.  Right.  I guess business is not so good, right?  That guy.  Did I mop the floor on Wall Street?  Could you please give me some slack? 
[00:24:30]  We all know that guy.  I want to talk about another...  We should do a bit right now.  That guy.  That guy.  There's another that guy I've wanted to bring to everyone's attention.  The guy that has to tell you the joke at work?  We got one at the other joint.  Really?  Oh, no.  And he's a really nice guy, but all of a sudden you get stuck in the elevator.  He goes, hey, did I ever tell you the time?  And you know, he's rolling into joke mode.  I don't know that guy at work.  Oh, man, I hate to blow up the spot.  You're stuck with him? 
[00:25:00]  A lot.  Yeah.  I think we kind of have the same hours.  Oh, you take the later elevator than I do.  I think that's what it is.  Across the place?  Yeah.  But there's a guy that can't wait to get our attention to tell his latest joke.  Oh, I know who you mean.  You do, right?  Yes.  He's a nice guy, but I hate that guy.  You don't like the joke guy?  No.  Do you like the joke guy?  No.  Are any of those jokes ever good?  No.  For real.  They stink.  Maybe if your grandpa...  Never knew my grandpa, so I'm just... 
[00:25:30]  Hello?  Hey.  I knew one.  I was calling it this hour.  No one.  That's what you do when that...  Oh, wow.  Oh, God damn.  Acting.  Nice.  That's what you do.  Nice.  When he goes, I got a joke for you.  It's not...  Mr. Faber-Sham, I'm taking your call.  You pick up the phone and you pretend someone just called you.  That's a good one.  If they said, I got a joke for you, that would be a lot smoother.  It's usually like, hey, I have a...  And then you realize, you thought he was just telling you something that was happening in  his life and it's like, no. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, my God.  He's setting up a joke.  The second you realize it's a joke, one finger up, the phone to your ear.  Yeah.  That's a good one, Jim.  Yeah.  And then the call lasts the whole time.  And you're like, I'll catch you.  No.  You're gone.  I mean, when you got like grandpas, the older generation, when they go with the joke,  it's okay.  I don't mind that.  I don't get the C-word punchline, especially when grandma tells me those.  Well, it's usually some racist joke from the best.  And it's about your mom.  All right. 
[00:26:30]  So we'll talk about that guy today.  There's a few of those out there.  We used to have a bit, remember the Arm Around the Guy guy?  Yeah.  That's one of that guy's kind of guys.  I hate that guy, too.  It's the guy at the ball game, at movies, whatever.  If you don't leave the one-seat homo buffer that most adolescents and young adults use.  But then after a while, you kind of grow out of the one-seat homo buffer at the movie theater.  But then you've got to worry about Arm Around the Guy guy.  This is the guy that will sit, even at like a dinner at a restaurant, he's generally your friend in some way, shape, or form. 
[00:27:00]  It's easy to go.  Or a business associate.  But it's easy to go gay with this thing.  No, no.  It's nothing about being gay.  But we're not going there for once.  This is guys you know are straight, but they have to do what Anthony's describing.  They've got to be your buddy in order to be your pal.  It's not really your friend because none of us would do that to each other because we're close enough friends.  It's a guy that's like on the periphery of your friendship, perhaps a business associate, something like that. 
[00:27:30]  And he's got to lean over and put his arm around your chair back and kind of like talk to you like that.  He's not touching.  He's not really touching you.  Look, we all know that feels comfortable.  Yeah, but not around me.  It instantly puts you in the bitch seat.  Like it's some kind of power move.  Maybe it is a power move.  To put you in the bitch seat.  Maybe it is.  I usually just take my hand and put it right on there.  And that pretty much trumps the arm around the guy guy. 
[00:28:00]  Makes it a nicer experience anyway.  For everybody.  Sure does.  You feel close.  He's turned on.  Yes.  Lovely.  A little jizz.  Handful of clam chowder.  I was going to say a little jizz in the pants makes everybody happier.  Right?  Does it?  Of course it does.  Hey, the economy is really bad.  No.  Let's get this horrific story out of the way and then we can move on to maybe some fun stuff today.  Ah, this is a big story in the news, yeah.  You know what I'm talking about?  Oh, yeah.  The guy, he used old school faxes?  Did he fax or email?  I heard he faxed. 
[00:28:30]  He did fax, right?  The police department.  His intentions.  And a news...  Danny, you got...  It was a fax?  And a news channel.  Yeah, that's what we're talking about.  Yeah, he faxed.  Perhaps the most horrific story of the day.  Absolutely.  Who do you think handed it in?  Of course.  But he also, this guy, they say he pulled his kids out of public school two weeks ago.  And he was setting up to do this.  This guy was nuts.  This went beyond his job.  That's disgusting.  And apparently they were under investigation for some type of alleged child deduction or getting money for their children. 
[00:29:00]  Gotcha.  Some kind of...  The state government gives them money for their children.  They apparently lost their job.  I don't know.  I guess the story will come out.  If you want to kill yourself, fine.  Just don't kill everybody around you.  Because they want to live.  You know what was really creepy?  Looking at his Facebook page.  Really? 
[00:29:30]  Yesterday.  Yeah.  Had old family pictures up there.  And like them just...  I think he might have overextended himself.  It looked like he had a pretty good house.  A pretty nice house.  And they showed some interior shots.  Nice bathroom.  Stainless steel bathroom sinks.  Nice fixtures.  Very good.  He was doing...  Maybe he was doing well for a while.  It looked like he was doing good.  Maybe he overextended himself when they both...  Both the parents had lost their jobs.  Right.  But again, until this investigation comes to light, who knows what was going on.  Here's the story.  A man recently fired from his job may have killed his five kids, his wife, and eventually himself. 
[00:30:00]  Police say Irvin Antonio Lupo contacted a local television station to make his intentions known.  The station, KABC, then called police.  He faxed a two-page written statement to KABC Channel 7 in Los Angeles.  And he also called that station this morning, about 8.30 or so.  And in the note, he talked about his issues with his employer, job situation.  We're not clear exactly where that is. 
[00:30:30]  We're talking to his employer right now.  And in the note, he clearly said he was going to kill himself, his wife, and his kids.  Lupo was despondent about his wife's job and his job.  His letter said they'd both been fired.  Neighbors expressed disbelief.  If none recalled hearing gunshots, police say a revolver was found next to Irvin Lupo's body.  The Lupo children ranged in ages from 2 to 8.  Why do you have to kill your family?  What's that about?  What a coward. 
[00:31:00]  Revolver means he had to reload.  Yeesh.  He had time to think after every...  Yeah.  He had weeks to think, though.  He pulled them out of school.  Yeah.  He's hard.  Why do you have to kill your family and your wife?  Let them live.  Damn.  Let them move on.  You're not going to know the difference.  A lot of these people have this kind of, yeah, I don't want them, you know, moving on without  me.  I'm much too important.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Or, you know, you just have jealousy, kind of think that whole thing.  Who knows?  I'm sure they'll, in the days and weeks to come, find out what the hell the story is with 
[00:31:30]  this one, but...  Eh.  Pretty tragic.  Pretty tragic.  Pretty tragic.  Len Berman, who does New York sports, is an awful looking man.  Wow.  He's been around forever.  Yeah.  20 years.  Ranger highlights.  Ugh.  What's the matter?  Ugh.  You don't even know what your team's going to be.  You know, this is the first time I'm a fan, and I'm embarrassed to say this because,  you know, I'm going to catch S for this, but I have season tickets. 
[00:32:00]  I can't tell you the last game I went to.  Really?  They've barely won since early December.  At this point, I don't want them to win another game because then, you know, we'll  get a nice draft pick, but it's just horrendous what's happening to the Islanders.  Horrendous.  Awful.  It's a building century.  It's tough to be a fan.  I'm not even going to lie.  It's tough year after year after year.  A couple years ago, it seemed like we were on the way up and then right back down. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, I remember that.  You were all excited going to all the games.  Actually, it was like this kind of a vibe.  Actually made the playoffs.  There was a vibe like there was when they were Stanley Cup champs forever.  You know how bad your team sucks if you don't make the playoffs?  In hockey, they allow everyone in the playoffs.  Yeah, pretty much.  How many teams don't make the playoffs?  Four, maybe?  Whatever.  And then they got Super Bowl coverage.  Three and the Islanders.  Yeah.  Pretty much.  Who doesn't make it?  Got Super Bowl coverage. 
[00:33:00]  I was thinking about that last night, and we had talked about it briefly yesterday.  There is no hype.  And when we talked about it yesterday, I didn't realize that it's this Sunday.  And normally, at least two weeks out, you are seeing nothing but hype.  I mean, there's radio stations doing contests for ticket giveaways.  TV is talking about the appliance stores are pushing their big screens for the big game and this, that, the other.  Dude, nothing.  There is no vibe on this at all. 
[00:33:30]  Are you getting the feeling that everything...  Into society?  Not into society, but close.  Anarchy?  That everything we are used to and know is going away?  Everything we are used to and we know is going away.  Not like drastically, but we grew up with newspapers, and that's almost a joke now.  Yeah.  Newspapers are folding.  You think this is a big click up?  You know how things are gradual and they have a click up in technology or industry, things that happened in the early 1900s with the industrialization? 
[00:34:00]  Right.  This is maybe one of those clicks where...  That would be nice to live through one of those.  This is a drastic change that we are, like, as obsolete as the people were.  We're on the bubble there, my brother.  It's just an overall feeling.  Newspapers going away.  We were talking about cell phones where it's almost a joke to actually call someone on your cell phone.  No one does that.  It's all about texting and emailing and whatnot. 
[00:34:30]  And then you've got the Super Bowl.  It's not as exciting as it has been.  Don't forget, it's two lousy markets, though.  Yeah.  Bad economy.  It's not lousy.  It's true.  But...  What markets in the Super Bowl?  Yeah, yeah.  And still, the game itself has a...  Yeah, they're able to somehow, like, you know, live past that fact.  Yeah.  Well, the advertising money...  That's all hype.  I think the advertising money is not there.  Yeah.  The advertising money isn't there, so a lot of the sponsors that put on these big things  and hype it on commercials and whatnot before the game... 
[00:35:00]  It's just an overall feeling that we're in the middle of a major change.  I don't know how many years it's going to take, but it's, like, it's very unsettling.  Look at the business we're in.  Completely going away.  It's a different animal than when I got in.  Right.  Yeah.  I was like, you know...  You got baseball, where you got Manny Ramirez, he's not even on a team.  You had Andy Pettit having to take...  Within a couple of weeks.  Within a couple of weeks.  Had to take...  A 50% pay cut.  As a free agent.  He was offered 10, and he had to settle for 4 1⁄2 because he waited two weeks. 
[00:35:30]  And no one has picked up Manny Ramirez.  That's crazy.  There are some economic things that are purely economic, but I think that in itself will  have an impact on where we end up after this.  Right.  It's like, you know, if I could use this stupid analogy, it's like, when...  When there's a drought, and then years and years later, you cut a tree down, and they  could see where the drought was in the rings.  Like, I think this will have an impact on where we end up when we're spit out the other  end of this.  And I think you will see some of those things maybe being less important to people, reprioritizing. 
[00:36:00]  Like I was saying, when I used to watch Wide World of Sports, and there'd be a packed  Los Angeles Coliseum.  For Frisbee.  Full of people for dog Frisbee.  Yeah.  Event.  Now, like, who cares?  But that was...  Well, we didn't have the internet yet.  That was what he...  What else were we supposed to do?  But that's just it, too.  Yeah, the internet has done a lot to entertain people.  Do you have that same feeling, though?  There's a lot of changes in the air?  Yeah.  Or am I the only...  Definitely.  Dr. Kaku says we're becoming a type one, and within 100 years, it's going to happen. 
[00:36:30]  That's...  Dr. Kaku?  Oh.  He does.  You saw him in the elevator again?  He has no recollection of me.  Do you push his button?  Do you push what button Flory does?  I don't know what Flory lives on.  Is it like the top one?  No, he lives on...  Is it just stars next to the button?  He lives in space.  It's just an arrow with a question mark.  No, he lives on the other tower.  But no, I mean, that's the big change, I think.  I think right now you're on the bubble, but it's a 100-year bubbler and 80-year bubbler.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just a weird, like, general feel I'm getting right now. 
[00:37:00]  You look at...  About things just...  You look at your parents...  Unsettling.  ...and people at their age, and they don't understand...  And I know there are people that do, but I'm not talking about...  I'm talking about the norm.  Right.  Not the exception.  Like, my mother and Sal have no clue about the internet technology like that.  VCRs, even.  They got...  DVD players.  I mean, DVD players.  Things like that.  Like, VCRs, they caught that wave.  Had to really work a cell phone.  They caught that wave.  They caught the DVD wave out of necessity. 
[00:37:30]  But other things, they just got...  They didn't catch the wave.  Right.  They're left behind, and they'll never catch up.  And eventually, something will happen where we will be those people that just don't catch up.  What do you mean, eventually?  Have you hung out with a 10-year-old lately?  Yes.  And I have to answer for it.  You see what they can do on the internet?  One, eight, seven, seven, come on.  You see what they can do on the internet?  It's insane.  Yes, I have.  They can alert authorities.  They're very limber at that age. 
[00:38:00]  I'm not even talking 10-year-olds, actually.  Four or five-year-olds on the internet.  It's ridiculous.  Take a 10-year-old.  Ridiculous.  10-year-old now.  Like, what they know, what they're going to see technologically that we all have no comprehension of.  Yeah, yeah.  Their grandkids, you know, what is it, 85 years from now, will be looking at things that 10-year-olds now are like,  What is that?  We didn't have that now.  Yeah.  Like, it just keeps going.  Oh, man, I don't want to be one of those guys left behind.  You're going to be one of those guys.  You make a really good point.  My dad, I consider him a pretty smart man.  I could not get him to work his cell phone and to check his effing messages. 
[00:38:30]  It's infuriating.  And he ran his own business and did very well for himself.  They're not stupid.  Well, we weren't poor.  We were rich and poor, whatever.  But he was an entrepreneur and he was a thinking man.  And he couldn't figure out the cell phone.  It was amazing to me.  They're not stupid people.  I've tried to get my mother to even text to where, you know, we don't need a long phone call for me to just say hi or what's going on.  Right.  Email.  Just have something in your house that can get an email, can send a picture. 
[00:39:00]  Just something that, you know, but she doesn't even want to.  Like, she's afraid of it.  She goes, no, no, no.  And this is like my open-minded, pretty liberal-minded mother.  She just doesn't want to know.  They're scared of being swallowed up by it or overwhelmed by it.  Yeah.  It's really weird.  Exactly.  I'll never get it.  It's like looking into this giant opening a door and all you see is just machines.  Yeah.  Close it.  If you don't try it, you don't have to worry that you're not going to understand it. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  There's always an element of doubt that, well, if I did, I'd deal with it.  But if you try it and don't understand it, then you realize how out of the loop you are.  You want to just stay comfortable.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Learning new stuff, changing yourself.  That's a scary thing.  Yeah.  It's always a scary thing.  Here's another thing.  Overall feel, you know, I mean, we could.  I was going to say without getting too deep into it, but we could, certainly.  We have a president, unlike any president that came before him in recent... 
[00:40:00]  Say that again.  Well, I mean, he's going to be, like, a very different president than what we're used to.  Yeah.  Whether you like the past presidents or not.  There's guys you like, then there's guys you hate, but we're sort of the same guy, more or less.  I know I'm generalizing maybe a little too much, but this guy is way different than what we're used to.  He's trying.  Yeah.  I think they're really trying to beat him down, though.  Well, they're going to try to beat him down.  They're like, all right, business as usual.  We don't like your bill.  We're going to see what happens.  Yeah, I got... 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  But it goes with this general thing I'm talking about, where there just seems to be a lot of changes in the air.  A lot of things are changing.  I like the fact that he's doing something with stem cells.  I don't like the Guantanamo Bay move at all.  No, I don't like that.  I don't like this business as usual, pork-loaded, earmarked, bullcrap stimulus program.  That, to me, is business as usual.  He's talking about transparency and everything.  And then the stimulus package has billions of dollars earmarked for things that will not help the economy. 
[00:41:00]  That whole stimulus package is to help the economy.  And they're ready to give money to people that don't pay taxes as a rebate.  That's called welfare.  They're ready to give perhaps upwards of $4 billion to Acorn, that friggin', the people that got behind him during the election.  The two guys, the black guys that were standing out in front of that polling place, yeah.  They were part of the Acorn.  They're like a community activist thing. 
[00:41:30]  That is not going to help the economy.  $200 million, earmarked for low-income family planning.  Now, as a president in a sound economy, all right, let her rip.  Okay, you son of a bitch.  Just because I'm talking a little...  What? No, just turn off your phone and continue.  I'm sorry.  My phone wasn't on.  $200 million?  What were you saying?  $200 million, earmarked for...  For what?  What happened?  You're going to hit that goddamn...  I'm not.  I don't have a button. 
[00:42:00]  Go ahead.  Continue talking.  For low-income family planning.  What?  Low-income family planning.  That doesn't help it.  If you're in a sound economy and you're a president that wants to do that, then you do it.  In this, if it's a stimulus package, have everything directed towards helping the economy.  That don't do it right now.  But it will help in a couple years.  Will it?  Yeah, because he's got four years before his first term is up.  So.  Oh, my God.  I swear I'm going to throw something.  I'm just going to hold my grapefruit and pet it like it's a pillow. 
[00:42:30]  But it doesn't matter.  I finally came up with a defense.  I'm really happy.  If you're not pumping out babies, that's saving us money.  I like it.  You think $200 million to a family planning, low-income family planning, is actually going to help?  Abortions and rubbers?  You bet it will.  Give them $300 million.  It ain't going to help.  There's got to be a lifestyle change there.  I agree, too.  That I don't think just handing out condoms and it doesn't – that doesn't help. 
[00:43:00]  I'm sorry.  Come out with a new way to change it.  They're also trying to make up, I think, too, because Bush's administration, I think for anyone – like a lot of federal funding completely stopped for any people that were like even offering abortion or counseling on it.  They were really bad with that, so this might just be making up for some of that, but I like it.  Don't put it in the stimulus package.  Don't make it an issue where we've got to now wait for them to debate a very sensitive conservative and liberal agenda when all this is supposed to be is to help the economy right now. 
[00:43:30]  And you know that Democrats and Republicans are at odds over a subject like that.  It'll never get through.  What do you think of Obama, though, and what he's doing so far?  Who?  Barry Hussein?  What?  You mean Barry Hussein?  No, it's Barack –  It's Barry Hussein.  Barack Obama.  Barry Hussein.  What do you think of him so far?  Not enough time's gone by.  I'm not letting you hit me with that goddamn phone. 
[00:44:00]  My finger's on it.  Barry.  Hey, hey, hey.  Barry Hussein.  Hey.  Hey.  He's our president, Barry Hussein.  Opie and Anthony.  All right.  Just around midnight.  Opie and Anthony.  I've just been informed that we lost our big TV.  Now, you might be saying to yourself out there in Radioland, what's the big deal?  Well, we've been telling you guys for the last, I don't know, six months that things are slowly 
[00:44:30]  but surely falling apart here in this studio here in New York City, and we're completely  convinced one day just nothing's going to work, and that'll be the end of our show.  Yeah.  It's hanging on the wall, and it's off.  60-inch Panasonic, right?  Yeah.  It's a nice TV.  It's an impressive TV.  If you've been following along, though, we've been losing our DVD player here. 
[00:45:00]  They're duct-taping this over here.  We've still got the same board that Howard Stern used many, many years ago in front of  us.  Nothing has been updated.  I mean, we're looking at appliances and equipment that has wood.  Yeah.  It's actual wood in 2009.  Yeah, it's encased in wood.  That's how old this stuff is, and they're not bothering to fix anything at this point.  That's how bad radio's gotten. 
[00:45:30]  And now we have officially lost the large-screen TV, and I'll tell you why we officially lost  it, because they were quoted at, what, $1,300 to fix it?  Yeah.  That ain't happening.  Power supply problem.  That ain't happening.  Give me the baseball.  The paperwork coming for us.  Wait, power supply problem?  What's that mean?  Yeah, they have to replace the entire power supply.  It has an intermittent problem, and that's $1,300.  So why, isn't it covering the warranty?  No, it's older than a couple years now.  Yeah, I think it's older.  That looks a bit on the old side.  Well, they were sponsors, so why don't they just fix it? 
[00:46:00]  Were.  Were.  So you did put in that word that was oh so important to me.  Yes.  Were.  There were a lot of people that were sponsors a year ago in radio.  They all also were sponsors.  I'm hoping this TV is owned by 1-877-CARS-4-KIDS.  Yeah, then we'll get it fixed.  Yeah.  So another piece of equipment down.  It's slowly but surely going to happen to us.  You watch.  Speaking of equipment, I've got to thank Sam. 
[00:46:30]  I'm just bringing this to everyone's attention because I think everybody has been there.  My girl's laptop just cracked out yesterday.  Yeah.  Three years of stuff on her Mac.  It was a Mac.  It was a Mac.  Thank God it was backed up because when that happens normally, you lose everything.  Yeah.  Well.  So thank God you guys are smart enough to back all that up.  You put on external hard drives.  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  And off-site.  Yeah.  You pop your pictures up on like photo dump or something like that.  Exactly.  In case you're a fire or something.  All right.  So let's move on. 
[00:47:00]  What do you.  Well, that's what responsible people do, you know.  What?  What?  Wait.  And let's, you know, and just like a lot of people out there, we said many times like,  you know what?  We've got to back up these computers.  Ah, we'll get to it.  And yesterday was a day it went dead.  Gray screen, folder, question mark.  And she lost everything from the last three years.  Pictures.  Every picture.  Screenplays.  All sorts of stuff that's in there. 
[00:47:30]  Stuff she's writing.  Oh, my God.  All kinds of good.  Is she freaking out?  Oh, my God.  Her whole iTunes library.  Danny's bump on his head is, where's that going up, Danny?  That's a good one.  Are you?  I'm sorry, but Jesus Christ.  That was Twitter.  That's a three stooges bump.  I see that Danny is, you're doing the Twitter.  Nice.  Yeah, someone like me to.  Let me pull it up for you.  Huh?  It's going up on ONA.  Wow.  And it's going up on ONA.com?  That is...  ONAradio.com, excuse me.  ONAradio.com.  That's a nice bump. 
[00:48:00]  It looks like Wolverine from the X-Men without the skill or agility or build.  Exactly.  Without the muscles.  Witty remarks.  Cute jackal off.  Nice facial hair.  That's a nice bump on your head there, buddy.  Very impressive.  Oh, you can get to it through Not Sam's Twitter.  Okay.  Yeah, and I'm sorry.  Should I try Hugh Jack Daniels?  That's a good one.  See the comedy?  Yeah? 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  Right?  Right?  Right.  He's cracking up.  He got it.  He got it.  He got it.  Danny, send me the picture.  I'll throw it up on my Twitter account.  Okay.  I'll send it out to my followers, ONAradio on Twitter.  Yes, Jimmy.  You guys didn't back it up on the...  No, so for all three years of her stuff, just like that, right?  And we go to the Mac store.  Two guys go, you are so effed.  They can do some of that CSI stuff, and that's not even a guarantee.  You understand some of that CSI stuff where they have to take the hard drive into a special 
[00:49:00]  environment, I guess?  Yeah, well, they've got to open up the case sometimes and, yeah, take it out that way.  But the thing is, we talked about this yesterday when we were leaving, and I was saying to you,  it's rare these days that you have a hard drive crash where everything's unrecoverable.  A lot of times, it's power supply, like the stupid TV or things like that, and if you  can get to the hard drive, put the hard drive in another unit, you're fine.  So when you told me that the guy said, you know, this thing is done, I'm like, what? 
[00:49:30]  That doesn't...  Two guys at the Mac store.  So you should start wearing one of those powder blue shirts and walk around the Mac store  and help people out.  I'm too busy dressing like G.I.  Joe every day, apparently.  I noticed this morning, I really do have a problem.  So, not to get off track for too much, but...  It's all good, don't worry about it.  I dress like G.I.  Joe every day now.  I'm a cartoon character with a closet full of the same military clothing.  You have the same kinky, awful hair he does, the kung fu grip with your right hand. 
[00:50:00]  Yes, the kung fu grip.  It's right around the good parts.  Of course.  The naughty bits.  You're smuggling arms to somebody out there.  Yeah, I look like an arms smuggler, a Cuban...  A freedom fighter.  A freedom fighter.  A queer.  Okay.  Sure.  Yeah, look at G.I.  Joe.  Danny had a great picture of G.I.  Joe up there.  And look at me.  I am dressed the same.  Yeah, you like that green color.  I have a green wooden foot locker at the foot of my bed.  I really am crazy. 
[00:50:30]  Is it unlocked?  Of course it is.  Oh, no.  There's no donut in there, though.  Please.  Please, Sarge.  I want to dump it on the floor and examine it.  Let's make sure nothing's missing.  But you're knocking on the floor.  So we go to the Mac store.  They said, you're effed.  They looked at it and said, just like you were saying, I thought they were going to say  that.  They're like, no, you're done.  Maybe if you go to one of those places where they specialize in this and you could spend up  to $1,000, $2,000 and it's still not guaranteed that they'll get any of your data back. 
[00:51:00]  Was she devastated?  Devastated.  It was a rough day in the Hughes household.  Oof.  Well, that sounds weird when you say that.  I know.  It is.  I still have a hard time saying wife.  Household.  His wife sounds just so, like, old.  So did I.  I don't know.  But anyway, so I go, you know what?  We're not giving up hope.  And Sam happened to be around.  So we gave the laptop to Sam.  And Sam says, I might know a guy where I live and let's give it a shot.  Anyway, later on in the afternoon, Sam calls up and goes, you're not going to believe this, 
[00:51:30]  but I was messing around doing some stuff and I was able to turn the computer back on  and it powered right up.  So he grabbed his external hard drive and got all her stuff off the thing and then the thing  crapped out again and he can't turn it back on whatsoever, even doing the same little tricks  he was doing.  He had a small window of opportunity there.  We totally lucked out.  The static electricity in his hair powered up the computer for a limited time.  That's funny. 
[00:52:00]  It probably is a power supply issue, though.  You're right.  Maybe they didn't think to look for that.  Well, those mother effers, because this is three years of stuff.  And then I'm at the Mac store and they're like, you join the statistic of people that  learned the hard way and now we'll back up everything.  You're going to join the statistic of people that lose their teeth to a laptop.  Yeah.  Yeah, because we almost just said, all right, here, take this piece of crap laptop and  give us a new one.  Do you know there's a program they have on Mac, which I forget what it's called.  It's called Time Machine.  Yes.  We had it.  Time Machine. 
[00:52:30]  I love it.  Were you using it?  No.  The Enchantment Under the Sea dance with it.  Does it back up?  What?  Does it back up?  It backs up onto something else other than your computer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like it goes to a third part?  Automatically.  Like you could set it to just back it up every so long.  Mine backs up, but I also back it up, I think, onto it.  I have one of those Mac Airports.  Yes.  And it backs up onto that, I think.  Yeah.  Is that how it works?  Yeah.  There's a terabyte hard drive connected to that.  And it automatically does it whenever you turn it on. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  Everything I own is backed up on three locations.  That's smart.  Me too.  And one is off-site.  What's off-site?  It means not my house.  Just say not your house.  Not my house.  Off-site.  Oh, you mean like online?  I meant at the governor's house.  Sorry.  I want to apologize to the governor of the state of New York.  Yeah, that's right.  And finally said, I really am crazy, so people are happy.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's go to Dawn in Virginia.  This is weird.  Dawn.  Yes.  Hey.  Hey, we've thrown hard drives in the freezer before to attempt to get information back off 
[00:53:30]  of them, so there's lots of things that are possible.  What does that do?  Really?  But why are the people at the Mac store going, you're so done?  They wanted you to buy a new computer.  Well, we were going to anyway.  And because we got the AppleCare, we're going to get a free hard drive.  They're going to fix the damn thing.  But it wasn't about that.  It was about losing three years of material.  You could physically take your hard drive out of your computer.  I don't think so.  And put it into another computer.  I don't think so.  They ought to have a laptop there, or a couple of them, that are just made for that. 
[00:54:00]  Just made so you could slam it in.  It was slam it in.  But it was pretty much a miracle.  Where is Sam?  It was pretty much a miracle yesterday, thinking you lost three years of stuff.  The OS is on it.  It doesn't matter.  It's going to boot up.  Sam, what do you do to get this thing back on?  I mean, this thing was dead.  Yeah, you could hear it.  I mean, the hard drive's not in good shape.  You could hear it when it started up that it wasn't running right.  Oh.  Yeah.  Damn it. 
[00:54:30]  How many gigs was it?  Like, how much did you have to pull off?  It's an 80 gig hard drive, and there was like 40 gigs worth of stuff.  Yeah, because they're trying to say that we used up all the space on the hard drive.  I'm like, there's no way.  Half the hard drive was empty.  Did you back it up, or just kind of copy, paste onto another?  How did you get it all fast?  I just copied and pasted everything.  I wasn't going to run any apps.  Like a right click and pull it off, right?  Yeah, I just dragged it.  But how did you get it back on?  I had drag and drop.  Did you shake it or something to get it back on?  No, you just kind of sketch. 
[00:55:00]  I mean, I held the power down for different amounts of time and fidgeted with it.  I've been using Macs for a really long time, so.  Well, then you should be working on the Macs for it.  As long as it works, you hit it.  I swear.  I've taken my computer.  When you think your computer's completely broken and there's no hope left.  I'm with you.  Take it, hold it between both of your hands, and smash it on something real hard, and then  power it up again.  But the same thing happened to my computer, and I brought it to the store, and the whole  folder came up, and they said, there's nothing we can do. 
[00:55:30]  You have to get a new hard drive.  There's nothing.  And then I said, well, we'll try to recover some data off it.  So I said, yeah, do that.  And then when I got the new computer, or the new hard drive, they said, yeah, we couldn't  get anything off the old one.  There's something going on there.  I mean, I backed everything up.  They don't really try.  But Sam, you might be onto something.  You might have discovered a way to save a lot of people a lot of misery out there.  Yeah, and if that doesn't work, a .223 round will pretty much seal its fate.  You're right, though.  Sometimes old school, you just punch your thing.  Just hit something. 
[00:56:00]  Your stuff.  Sometimes it works.  You just have to fidget with it.  Fidget with it.  Yeah.  All right.  Sam, because you saved my girl a lot of misery, why don't you plug your Twitter account?  Because I know that's what you want.  Wow.  I know that's what you want today.  Name of the game, some eyeballs.  Because my wife's going, we've got to get him something really nice for this.  I'm like, trust me, I've got the perfect thing.  This is all he wants.  Here's a plug for his Twitter account.  You can find me at Twitter slash NotSam.  Ah.  We're even now, right?  Yes. 
[00:56:30]  We're good?  See, I know.  I know.  Are we square?  We're square.  Are we square?  It's been a weird week.  I get my phone back that I thought was lost.  She gets all her info back from a laptop that she thought was completely done.  Does she write screenplays?  She's a, yeah, she's a very, uh, yeah.  I want a part in one.  Really?  Yes.  You want to play the young shock jock with his finger up his nose? 
[00:57:00]  I just got beef.  Let's say hi to Jared in Boston.  Jared.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  If I, uh, if I pony up $1,300, do I get naming rights over that TV you got?  Hey, that's not a bad idea.  Wow.  Whoever gets his TV fixed will call it the blank TV.  Jared TV or something.  All right, that's good.  I like that.  Pretty bad state of affairs when the, uh, when the listeners are fixing your crap. 
[00:57:30]  I know.  We have to whore ourselves out for advertising dollars.  Speaking, by the way, of technological glitches.  Sorry.  Um, I want to thank, uh, Steve and his girlfriend for both, for some reason, sending me messages  they meant for each other.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no, they didn't.  My last text to Steve.  Oh, no.  I sent him one last night.  I said, Angel, we should have Greg Gutfeld on, just as a reminder. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  Jimmy always starts his messages with us, by the way, with a sweetie, Angel, love, I love  it.  And then Steve Wright, uh, wrote, okay, Puddin, I will give Joshua a call, who's the producer  over at Red Eye.  Yeah.  So this morning I woke up, really nice, morning baby, didn't sleep much at all, miss you terribly,  how was the snow?  And then the next one, love you so much, Angel.  Yeah.  And then I really laughed, because I got these all together.  Who said love you so much, Angel? 
[00:58:30]  These are all from Steve.  Oh, oh.  Yeah.  Aw.  And the next one is, and of course, I send you the wrong text, effing phone.  And I wrote back, ha ha, no you didn't, they fell into the right hands.  And so, MJ, I don't know what it is with your phones, but MJ and I talked, she's helped  me with my diet.  So, um, uh, the last thing I texted her, she was like saying she's going to help Bob Kelly  work out, and she would help me.  And I wrote, great, thanks, I'd love that.  So we, I called her with a peanut butter question. 
[00:59:00]  Uh-oh.  And we, and she said.  Now you're going to get punched in the face.  Chunky Rottweiler, yes.  Oven mitts.  No, I, I, we, I was in the supermarket, and the call got dropped, so she, uh, she wrote  back, sorry, I lost you, tried calling back.  As long as I'm near my phone, I'm always available to help you.  And then this morning I get one, good morning, my love.  Snow wasn't as bad as expected.  Could have come home last night.  I'll be home tonight to rub your back and swirl your hair so you can sleep well. 
[00:59:30]  So, love you too, baby.  That I didn't know.  And I wrote back, I am looking forward to that.  Although my crew, although my crew cut will make it difficult.  But I like the fact that she's going to twirl his hair.  That's the favorite part.  Yeah.  Because she means his back hair.  Yes.  Dear Lebanese idiots.  So, I don't know what's happening with these two, but I'm in the middle. 
[01:00:00]  Wow, these stupid phones, and believe me, your text messages are sectioned off into columns,  so the last person I text at night is usually her.  Yeah.  It just happened to be you last time, so I picked up the phone and started typing my lovey-dovey  stuff, and ugh.  Don't happen with the old iPhone.  No, it doesn't.  Yes, it most certainly does.  I've done that before on the iPhone, because when you.  That got fixed with the upgrade.  Oh.  I haven't had it happen anymore.  Okay.  Yeah, there you go.  So, keep your mouth shut.  All right, fair enough.  That's really funny.  Oh, dude.  Oh.  That's really good.  What a couple of little sweetie pies. 
[01:00:30]  I miss you, too, love.  It was snow.  You want to curl your back hair and braid it.  Yeah.  I miss you, MJ.  I want to just rub your ankles.  What?  What's wrong with these two?  They're all nice.  It bugs me.  I was hoping for some.  I wish I would have gotten some savage messages.  Oh, something horrid, right?  All right.  Dear cuck, wash the special belt with the attachment.  You'll get yours later.  Those get sent much later in the evening.  A good one.  A good one.  I love a Steve improv. 
[01:01:00]  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, God.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  Hold on.  Fantastic.  Hold on.  My girl texted me back.  Oh.  Let's see if she realized her error.  It's funny.  She went, it was intentional in my head.  It's funny.  We got Adam Ferrara stopping by.  Ah.  Hey there, pal.  Your old pal is in Mall Cop.  I know.  I didn't find out until I bashed it.  Well, you know what? 
[01:01:30]  That's not making up to do it.  It's obviously great for him.  Yes.  It's great for him.  Anything good for my pal is good enough for me.  He deserves a real break, finally, in this business.  Yeah.  Crappy business.  He's a guy who's been pucksing around aimlessly.  Right.  He's a guy who's been pucksing around for 18.  Yeah.  Working for Leary.  He's always working, man.  I know.  He's always headline gigs.  Yeah.  He's got easy gigs.  The guy has never stopped working since he got out of high school.  Yeah.  Take a break, you idiot.  Amazing.  Why?  I don't know.  Sit down for a second. 
[01:02:00]  That's the hyper.  This isn't the time for him to take a break.  Take a seat.  This is, you know, he's on his way up big.  He's in a hit movie.  A huge hit movie.  Even when he comes over the house.  It's like he doesn't know where a chair is.  Just sit down for a minute.  He's a little fidgety.  Oh, my God.  He doesn't know how to sit.  I know.  So, Adam will join the program at 8.  Speaking of movies, we got a great Steve Martin update for Jimmy because Jimmy just loves  Steve Martin.  Yeah, I was reading.  He's going to be on SNL, I think, this Saturday.  Oh, wow.  He's probably hosted more times than anyone else. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, boy.  I bet you he has.  He's been very...  So exciting.  He can be very funny when he wants, but...  Playing strange in automotive.  Now, I haven't...  You know something?  I haven't found him funny or relevant for many years,  but I haven't really seen any.  I saw that stupid, like, Father of the Bride, I think, once.  Uh-huh.  That was on.  Uh-huh.  And I passed by the television with my gay lover.  And it was just awful.  It was awful.  Well...  He hasn't done anything funny or relevant. 
[01:03:00]  Well, the guy understands how important it is to have a wedding in a movie.  Apparently.  And we're going to get into it.  We heard about this yesterday, but there are some quotes in this.  If Jimmy was growing his hair, he would just pull it all out because...  I did read about the Martin update.  This one is unbelievable.  It really is irritating.  We'll get into that.  Adam Farrar.  And look what I do for Danny.  Danny got in a car accident this morning, right?  I sure did.  Right?  Yes.  And you got a huge lump on your head. 
[01:03:30]  You took a picture of it.  I certainly do.  And look at this.  Look at that.  To all my followers, they're now going to see...  It's up there.  Cool.  ...a picture of Danny's lumpy head from his car accident.  With the BlackBerry, you can do that.  Yes, you can.  You take a picture, and then I pop it up to all my followers on Twitter.  Opie Radio on Twitter.  And I'll throw this out there to the fans.  If they want to sponsor my bumper, I will rename the bumper of my car if they're willing  to replace it.  That's good.  It's already called the Drunk Protector.  And it's on Facebook, but you're way behind trying to get... 
[01:04:00]  I'm a little behind with getting the people approved.  Just relax.  It takes a while.  I'm working on it.  Last night, I was just clicking away.  Click, click, click, click, click.  I think they maxed out at 5,000 or something like that.  Yeah, it's worthless.  Is it?  I don't know.  I'm going to stop allowing followers in another couple days, I decided.  I figured this, because I figure I'll get 5,000.  It'll top out.  That's a perfect number.  No, here's the thing, though.  After 5,000...  Start another Facebook page?  Nope.  Another 5,000?  Nope. 
[01:04:30]  Now, when people start coming in, I'll start just randomly booting people out to see what  new blood comes in.  That's perfect.  People that are useless?  I know what you're talking about.  Can we really talk about this?  What, that there'll be 5,000 20-year-old girls?  Yes.  Eventually.  You're booting the 20-year-olds that aren't taking your hint.  No.  Once a certain birthday hits, goodbye.  Had my first legal drink, goodbye.  Jesus.  And then eventually, you'll be eligible to vote tomorrow, goodbye. 
[01:05:00]  316 party.  Yeah.  Bat Mitzvah, goodbye.  I get a bad reputation.  Let's go to break with this.  Jimmy's all over TV these days.  You were on Red Eye last night.  Yeah, it was a fun one last night.  We got a nice little clip as we go to break.  I used to work at McDonald's, and one of our managers started having terrible stomach pains,  and she went to the doctor, and he said, do you eat a lot of fast food?  And she said, yeah.  I work at McDonald's.  I eat three meals a day there.  And he said, oh, well, that explains that they put so much tenderizer in their meat that  your stomach has actually started to tenderize. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, God.  Is that a bad thing?  The problem with McDonald's is this is why it has a better reputation.  It's because the grimace looks like the growth under the arm of a fat person.  I think I'd ask you, yeah, it's true.  Opie and Anthony showing the airports.  They're actually taking off at LaGuardia.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Ugh.  After that Sully incident, who would want to take off from LaGuardia to begin with? 
[01:06:00]  Especially with the runways all snowy and icy.  I see two big plane crashes with everyone surviving in a row, because you had that one  before Sully.  Then you had this.  Then you had a FedEx plane that just went down, and the pilot and co-pilot walked away  from that one.  Where's the FedEx one?  I didn't hear about that.  Yeah, it was a turboprop, but it was a carrying package, mini-package.  What happens in that situation? 
[01:06:30]  You just sit there and go, huh, what happened to my, you know, pack package?  Probably all that bubble wrap saved those pilots.  I made them funny.  Jesus.  You check your tracking number, it just shows flaming wreckage.  Yeah.  Although they use the peanuts now.  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  What a pain in the neck when you get a package.  You can't find it.  It's in the middle, and it all just spills out everywhere.  It's like a game show.  You're trying to slowly pull the product out from the box, and peanuts are sticking to 
[01:07:00]  it, flying all over the floor.  Yeah.  I hate those peanuts!  What?  What about the peanuts?  What are they called that?  You can't eat them!  No!  They're styrofoam!  Oh, Kramer, don't eat the peanuts!  Stop using the word f***er!  People are checking out the picture of Danny's bump that he sent out on Twitter.  Once again, OP Radio.  Looks like he was hit squarely with a ball-peen hammer. 
[01:07:30]  And they're commenting, which is great.  Of course.  The best one so far, Danny drives like he plays Guitar Hero.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, Danny.  Oh.  Wow, that one.  What hurts more?  What's the f*** for that comment?  Oh.  I don't even get that one.  Oh, Danny.  See, because he played poorly when the intern beat him.  And you really got to take it because it was someone anonymously said that.  Oh, of course.  Why would they?  Oh. 
[01:08:00]  What else are they saying about you?  I see you're looking at the comments.  I just, I just, I just, oh, my dad commented.  He hopes I was wearing a seatbelt.  Thank you, dad.  Is that really your dad?  Yeah, I wasn't, by the way.  I wasn't.  You really got to wear the seatbelt.  OP, how many friends can you have on Twitter?  Like 200.  That's it?  Yeah.  It's a very small thing.  You're kidding, right?  That's why they call it Twitter.  What the hell is she trying to make the curtains match the rug these days?  You can only.  Oh, sorry.  I got distracted for a second. 
[01:08:30]  You can only have 200 friends?  Yeah, something like that.  That's horrendous.  Maybe, maybe like a thousand.  Who wants Twitter?  Oh, it's, it's not about numbers.  It's about like, you know.  Numbers.  No, it's.  I'm on one site.  You can have two friends.  Yeah.  What is that site called?  Loser.  That's not funny, but it's true.  Kind of is.  It's not.  Let's start a service where you can only have five, five friends.  Water.  Mouse.  That wasn't bad, though. 
[01:09:00]  I know.  I liked it.  Mouse joke, I mean.  Yeah.  Hey.  I thought about that goddamn mouse joke all night, and it made me laugh just thinking of  your face, like when I turned and looked at you, made me crack up laughing.  There's nothing better.  Well, obviously, killing is just better, but when you have to bomb, there's nothing  better than looking at Jimmy's face.  The joy in his face.  I imagine that same face opening up the bestest Christmas present ever on the bestest Christmas. 
[01:09:30]  I pull the, I pull the, I undo the bone, I undo the wrapping, and I open the thing,  and there's your face just saying it.  Yes.  Saying it.  And you are just smiling away.  Because it's like I've bombed so many times.  Because you know the hot, itchy scalp, and you know the feeling of swinging and missing,  and you know you've swung and missed.  They should have given the mice little things of water.  Water.  Ah, boo. 
[01:10:00]  23 years ago today.  Wow.  It's a big day in history.  85?  Or 86.  Oh.  86.  Back to the Future.  No.  No.  It's not a movie.  Although your Pink Panther update is right around the corner.  Wow, don't tell me the space shuttle Challenger.  Yeah.  Oh.  That was 23 years ago.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  What was the famous quote, Mr. Reagan?  I saw it on The Presidents on the History Channel recently.  Uh, they slipped the surly bonds of Earth and touched the face of God. 
[01:10:30]  Yes.  Yes.  That made everyone feel better.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I was like, for a second, like, he's giving his speech.  He's trying to, you know, help the nation out and stuff.  And I'm watching, and he's kicking back.  Of course, it's back then, so, you know, we're too cool for the room.  Just watching the news, drinking a beer, whatever.  Man.  And then Reagan just gives that speech, and you're like, you give that gasp of, like, 
[01:11:00]  I almost cried, son of a bitch.  Not even what they did.  They broke the clouds and fell.  It's a lie.  He kind of punched it up, Jim.  You know, can't quite get out there and say that.  They broke the clouds.  And felled.  And died.  On fire.  On fire.  The families.  Jesus.  You know, it's funny.  I can't believe this.  I was in rehab when that happened.  That's how I knew.  January of 86. 
[01:11:30]  Wow.  Really?  I was in January for a month, yes.  It's funny how tragedies make you remember stuff.  You know what I remember because of that?  You were in rehab.  I was going out with an anorexic chick that puked up the fine red lobster dinner I bought her.  Really?  That's what I remember when I think the Challenger explosion.  I was in Syracuse.  I scraped up money.  I told the story a few times.  And I was with this girl.  Liked her a lot.  And she was a bit on the thin side. 
[01:12:00]  And we went to Red Lobster.  She ate everything.  She ate all the shrimp and everything.  And she went to the bathroom just before dessert and came out with the watery eyes.  Oh, my God.  That rotten puke breath that bulimics have.  Nice.  I knew there, from that day on, I knew there was an issue.  And now I fully understood what anorexia was.  I didn't know until then.  I was five years older than the girls I have sex with now.  Oh.  Wait.  That's terrible.  What?  Wow.  That puts it in perspective.  You were five years old. 
[01:12:30]  You were six years old.  I'm kidding.  So you were six years old.  I was 20 flurf.  Yeah.  You just dated yourself, man.  What?  Wouldn't that make you like...  I did date myself last night.  Oh, come on.  Waka waka.  Jacka jacka.  Don't be so fresh.  Well, you know, at times you were alone.  Do you waka waka?  What?  Are you a man that waka wakas every once in a while?  Like a rabbit.  You do, right?  Oh, these days.  It's good.  It's good to know.  If I'm going, you know, you know. 
[01:13:00]  I hit the guys that go, I don't do that.  Shut up.  We all do it.  Jesus Christ.  What are you talking about?  I show a blacklight in my house.  Look like a Peter Max painting.  I've only done it like five times in the last month, month and a half.  I've been banging so much.  Yeah?  I've been told that before.  I've been banging so much lately.  That my legs.  You think I jacked too?  I know.  We were on a cam in front of Anthony.  And my legs and inner thighs and abs hurt.  Because I like to have sex like kneeling.  Yeah.  That's how I like to do it. 
[01:13:30]  I guess everybody does.  But even when she's on her back, I like to kneel.  Really?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, I can see that.  That's a good one.  We were talking about the sideways.  I love that one.  Sideways rules.  Girl on the side.  She looks like she's on.  She's on top is now bent.  She looks like a jogging trophy on her side.  Right.  Yes.  Yes.  Perfect.  Yes.  A jogging trophy on the side.  And then you just kind of, you know, swing that.  You've got to stop them halfway because they think you're flipping them over. 
[01:14:00]  Yes.  You're going to go like, no, no, no, hold up.  Right there.  Right there sideways.  Don't go.  We'll get to that later.  I just dated myself.  For the people out there, believe it or not, white people used to go to Red Lobster.  Thank you.  Yes.  That is true.  I think I just dated myself.  White trash people.  Because I remember.  People like, Opie, what are you, black?  Because it's really.  Oh, that's racist, first of all.  Well, it's a known thing that.  Is that racist?  That a lot of black people like the Red Lobster.  But there was a time that it was a place where white people went as well. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  Right?  White trash.  Like, I used to go there, and I was, you know, I was probably the biggest white trash.  I still am.  But I used to go there with the ex-wife.  Took her there.  And that's why I pay so much, to keep her in the lifestyle she was accustomed to.  Jesus Christ, the injustice.  That's really funny, man.  My God, man.  Did she?  Eh, never mind.  We'll talk about it.  Yeah, I know.  You're getting close.  In a few months.  You're getting close. 
[01:15:00]  Last payment is right around the corner, my friend.  Ah, the installment plan.  Mm-hmm.  So, oh, Steve Martin update?  Yes.  Steve Martin.  Who wrote this, by the way?  Is this a blogger, or I don't know who it is?  I don't know, to be honest with you.  But if these quotes are true, it's going to just drive you even more crazy there, Jimmy.  We're only about 10 days away from the Pink Panther 2 movie, A Pox on Your House, it's called.  And it is with a heavy heart that I report the formerly funny Steve Martin wants a third movie in the series. 
[01:15:30]  I really officially hate Steve Martin.  Yeah.  Hate him.  Official now.  For real.  Yeah.  According to W-E-N-N, Martin convinced the film's...  Huh?  When?  Yeah.  They're all capitalized.  They're stands for something.  Literal Jeff.  It's got to be a radio station, I guess.  Martin convinced the film's producer to throw in a wedding.  Because any time his movies contain weddings, they do well.  I said, I have to tell you that every movie I've done that ends in a wedding or holding a baby has been a hit. 
[01:16:00]  He said Al Pacino after doing The Godfather.  You're a real douche, Martin.  Martin explained.  Yeah, Couset's going to marry.  The best wedding and baby story came out of Modesto.  Did you do that story?  I must bring the anchor.  Yes.  What is this?  It floats.  Got to give this guy credits.  Get the big picture dot net.  Give him a little love today.  And because his raping of Peter Sellers' Jacques Cousteau is no longer a bachelor, Martin's patting himself on the back about his remarkable achievement. 
[01:16:30]  I do believe we've taken the Pink Panther somewhere else and, in a sense, made it our own.  Yeah.  The dump.  God.  Made it our own.  Why don't you create your own character and make it your own?  You did make it your own.  You removed the humor.  You surgically removed the humor.  Anything funny from the originals, yes, gone.  You've made it your own. 
[01:17:00]  You've taken a brilliantly funny character in a bunch of brilliantly funny movies and you have charmlessly wrecked them.  Yeah.  He sucks.  You watch the old Pink Panther.  What he is doing is the parallel bars and he just dismounts and falls down a flight of steps because the parallel bars are by the upstairs stairs.  It's fantastic.  He falls right over the stairs.  Dude, he just dismounts and falls down a flight of steps.  And then Steve Martin tries the same garbage and he's just terrible. 
[01:17:30]  The brilliance of Peter Sellers.  There's a clue in Martin's comments.  What happened to this guy?  Okay.  Seriously.  He made the Pink Panther his own?  Did he also make Cheaper by the Dozen his own?  There's a clue in Martin's comments about a possible threequel.  A clue even Clouseau could sniff out about how unfunny and completely irrelevant Steve Martin has become.  Bravo to this guy.  It would obviously open with Clouseau's honeymoon, admits Martin.  Him taking the call across the threshold as she's wearing arm pads and a helmet. 
[01:18:00]  That's funny because he's clumsy.  Yeah.  Well, then the guy writes, nope, not funny, not original, not interesting.  Not funny.  Not funny.  Do the bit.  Do the bit.  Do the bit.  Do the bit.  Do the bit.  Yeah.  Do the bit.  In fact, the only interesting thing about any of these movies is where Steve Martin's shame went.  Perhaps, if he finds it soon enough, he might also be able to track down his sense of purpose and his obligation to an audience to entertain. 
[01:18:30]  That's not even in a way accurate because he does entertain the audience.  They love these movies.  He's giving the audience what they want, but it's still a sickening ripoff.  And as a comedian, he should be called out.  I don't know why comedians aren't killing him for this.  Yeah.  Well.  Why aren't they murdering him for this?  Jimmy Norton.  You know what?  Comedians like to kill Dane Cook.  Oh, Dane and Louie.  Were they, were they, look, hey, Rogan, I love Rogan, because Rogan will call anybody out. 
[01:19:00]  Rogan's the exception.  He's going to beat them up.  But, yeah, but Rogan's got balls.  He doesn't pick and choose soft targets.  But guys yell at Mencia.  How about Steve Martin?  Where are comedians murdering this guy for destroying what is a comedy, a legend, a legendarily brilliant comedy performance, a series of them,  that was so owned by a guy who died.  They were so owned and so defined by sellers.  And he is destroying them with an unfunny, just like a high school French accent. 
[01:19:30]  And it's soft and it's weak and it's terrible.  And comedians are not murdering him for this.  They're too busy calling a Dane.  You know, it's really, why, do they want to work with Steve Martin in a movie?  It looks like a parody.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, it looks like an unfunny SNL parody of the original Pink Panther movies.  You guys want to have big comics, you want to have balls, leave Dane alone and start attacking this dope.  They're so geared to, I think, you know, parents taking their kids to see. 
[01:20:00]  Whereas I think the original was more, you know, adults going to the movies to see the original one.  Because it's just so, he's so bad in these.  Oh, he's so bad.  He's so wacky and zany and just, there's no charm to him whatsoever as the character.  I have some pride.  I have some pride.  Wear that Captain Hook uniform.  These boys down at IBM is just sort of...  You know, imagine with Jonathan, I'm going to slap up my helmet.  Look, he sent me out for that one audition. 
[01:20:30]  I told you my terrible audition.  Yeah.  Which I was awful on.  Yeah.  But then he told me after, he goes, I didn't want to tell you before you went, but they actually cast Steve Martin in that movie.  Ooh.  And I'm like, all right, but why wouldn't you tell me that so I didn't go?  Why did I go?  Yeah.  I didn't want to tell you.  I'm really annoyed about that, thinking about it right now.  If Steve Martin called you to be in a movie with him, would that be a tough no?  It'd be the fastest yes you've ever heard.  You got to keep your personal opinions and your professional life separate. 
[01:21:00]  Do you understand?  I would be the wacky neighbor in the Pink Panther 3.  All right, Jim, we need you to speak French.  Hello, Steve.  I am here.  You know, if Steve Martin ever had an inkling of how much you detest his version of that movie,  he should do that, just so he can go, there, now you're a hypocrite.  I'd say you're right.  Thanks for the check.  Yes, exactly.  Beat it with your stupid wig. 
[01:21:30]  You know what?  Again, I know it's easy to say he should turn it down when they're throwing $15 million at you,  but Steve Martin can pick and choose, man.  It drives me nuts that he did this.  He's a funny dude.  Planes, trains, and automobiles.  You can't say Steve Martin stinks.  No, but when did that come out?  John Candy ran circles around him in that movie.  Yeah, but he was great.  He played Neil really well.  He played more of the street.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But he was fun.  He played an ass.  Let's see where he's like, you know, he's like a chatty Cathy dog,  except you pull your own string. 
[01:22:00]  He was great.  All right, let's take a break.  We've got a break with more of Jim Norton on Red Eye last night.  More of me.  With Greg.  Greg Gutfeld.  Gutfeld, who did very well when he came in and did our show.  Greg Gutfeld is hilarious.  Got to get him back from last night.  Adam Farrar next.  I do believe he's a ride.  Where's that bum?  He's a ride.  All right.  Bum.  Studies show that thinking about exacting revenge makes people happy,  but actually inflicting revenge on an enemy leaves us feeling anything but pleasure. 
[01:22:30]  That's because punishing someone keeps us thinking about them  and worrying that they'll retaliate.  Let me go to you first.  You seem like a guy who takes pleasure in revenge.  Am I right?  Well, Greg, revenge is a dish.  Best serve call.  But then again, so is Gospatio.  You have to balance revenge.  Like, I've overdone it and it's not...  Like, there was a man at a company party once that interrupted me.  Yeah.  So I hired a gang to bludgeon his testicles with higher irons.  That was a little...  Yeah, I might say that was overdone.  Bit much.  Damn it. 
[01:23:00]  Hey, they may be gay, but they're still penguins.  Damn, these guys would steal other birds' nests and then raise the chicks as their own.  Doesn't that prove that gay couples should be allowed to adopt?  Well, I don't know, Greg.  First of all, what do you call a gay penguin?  A glacier biter?  I don't think they're even...  In a couple of years, they won't even have any glaciers to bite.  All right, that is so true.  I don't think these are gay penguins. 
[01:23:30]  I think they live in minus 20 degree weather.  They're just using each other to keep their penises warm.  Very nice.  I think I'm going to dump out of that because it's radio,  even though that was on Fox News Channel last night.  Another clip from Red Eye last night that Jim Norton did.  Red Eye!  Yes.  Yeah, that glacier biter.  I couldn't think of anything that was the equivalent of pillow.  Yeah.  It worked.  It was a week by and then you're killed with the next line, so.  I'm still critiquing, Jimmy.  Get out of here, Anthony. 
[01:24:00]  Shut up.  You're right.  Did I just mention this show coming out of the show Friday morning?  For Tower Theater, I'm doing it with Artie Lang.  We might tour together.  We're doing at least one show in Philadelphia, up at Darby.  February 21st.  Tickets go on sale this Friday morning.  LiveNation.com.  This will probably sell out.  Yes.  So, Saturday, February 21st, me and Artie, Tower Theater, up at Darby.  And you want to make sure you got at least 50% from our show and 50% from his show. 
[01:24:30]  I'm not, you know, it's funny, man.  I don't, I've had a, me and Artie have been fine, so I'm not worried about the Howard fans.  I want more ONA fans.  Of course I do.  That'll be nice.  Let's see what happens.  I don't want to get booed.  I think comedy just brings everyone together, Jim.  Yeah, comedy and a gang rape.  877-212-0NA.  Adam Ferrara.  There he is.  Hi, pal.  You're the guy from Mall Cop.  Yeah.  It's you. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, Hollywood star.  He's got to go around, make the round, say bye.  Do the, uh.  Say bye to everybody.  I like that, though.  It's a nice personal touch he gives everybody.  It's because we're friends.  He doesn't give a crap what the radio audience is doing as he takes his time hugging everybody  in the room.  You'd think he would learn a thing or two about, uh, you know, the entertainment business.  There you go.  As you're hugging everybody, people out there in radio lines going, what the?  Learning about the entertainment business.  What's going on?  What's going on?  What's going on?  How you doing, man?  I'm good, my friend. 
[01:25:30]  How are you?  Look at you.  Well, uh, you're in a movie?  Yes.  Is that why you're here or are you just like hanging?  No.  Yeah, we never know.  We never know with you.  It's so funny with Adam.  It's like, is he pushing someone?  We're just hanging out.  No, I'm just hanging out.  I tried to get a hold of you.  I don't know.  Did you get the text?  When?  I was coming out.  She, um, she's in L.A.  I was in L.A. for a while.  And I came home and I got a couple of weeks, uh, sans wife elect.  Oh, that was that Sunday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I wasn't available that Sunday.  I'm sure there's a story.  I don't know.  No.  Just wasn't available. 
[01:26:00]  I think I was hung over.  Perfect.  Yeah, perfect.  Why should that Sunday be any different?  True.  Did you say wife, Adam?  Or did you say wife?  Yeah.  You married?  No, I got engaged.  The wife elect.  Oh, elect.  Oh, okay.  We didn't know you got engaged.  Did you know it?  Sure.  When?  Yeah.  Um, when did I tell you?  A couple months ago?  Jesus.  I don't even know.  A couple of months ago.  That's awesome.  Congrats, man.  And your wedding.  I'm sorry.  Did you get the, uh...  Yeah, thank you very much for your very generous gift.  I felt so awful because the thing came late. 
[01:26:30]  You know, the invitation came late.  I'm like, I hope he's going to think I just...  Nope.  Nope.  Uh, that was, uh...  A lot of people thought I was inviting people last minute, but they screwed up with the invitations  when they were sending them out.  But that's old news now.  I was thinking, because I got the invitation late, I'm thinking, well, somebody must have  canceled.  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of people thought that.  But they...  My invitations sat at the post office for two weeks, something like that.  The postage was wrong or something?  Yeah, they thought the postage was wrong.  Some dummy down there.  And then we, uh, they, the wedding planners went down and were like, no, the postage  was right.  They just screwed up bad. 
[01:27:00]  The post office?  Sorry.  Oh, sorry.  It's crazy.  Oh, God.  This is unprecedented.  Getting married, Adam.  That's cool.  Yeah.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah.  When's the big date?  Uh, she's thinking November because...  No, I mean you got a date for the wedding.  Uh...  Can't bring a date to his wife.  Oh, literal Jim.  Go patch your goddamn grapefruit.  You love my grapefruit.  No.  I...  I liked your little comment before about the...  What?  He said it was like some child's head. 
[01:27:30]  It is creepy when you do that.  Isn't it?  I'm gonna eat it.  Just eat the damn thing, please.  Yeah, I'm gonna eat a plate.  But, uh, do you have a date for the...  No, she's with Dick in November because her family's gotta come in.  Dick in November.  Yeah.  All right.  That's what she's thinking.  Are you going with the big wedding or are you doing a little...  I'd rather not.  Oh, rather not and...  Yeah, it doesn't mean anything.  Well, she's on the same page.  You know, it's not like she's going, you know, I want a horse and carriages.  You know, she's...  Yeah.  So, but so we're looking around on where to get married and guess what she picked?  The old Eastern Military Academy. 
[01:28:00]  The castle.  Oh, really?  The castle.  Oh, he's the castle.  That's simple.  Yeah.  I said, where does, like, not spend a lot of money and castle fit in the same set?  Yeah, that's good.  If there's a drawbridge, we're not going.  Yeah, that's...  And, of course, you went, sure, hon.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, no.  I said, you like the castle?  Yeah.  I said, we can't live in the...  If we were going to get married, our reception would be 15 minutes long and people would have  to bring their own beer because that's all we can really afford.  You got left.  So, I don't know what we're going to do. 
[01:28:30]  I hope.  You think?  Well, yours was a big production.  I mean, the invitation...  You know what I love?  The dance numbers.  Look, in the end, it worked out great, but you know what?  Save yourself a lot of aggravation and just go and then throw a party.  Go, hey, we're partying when we get back.  That's what I...  I'm telling you.  Jump a broom in the phone with you.  For anyone out there, I'm telling you.  I did.  It worked out so well.  I had my reception at a place that I think a month later turned into a strip club.  Nice.  Perfect.  Your reception... 
[01:29:00]  Well, first we stopped to bet the Preakness at OTB.  That isn't even a joke.  No.  He got married by the Justice of the Peace.  Yeah, down in Northport.  In Northport, standing on a green shag rug.  Yep.  And the Justice of the Peace's wife was watching Barnaby Jones or something on a black and white TV.  And the Justice of the Peace looked like that old guy that came to the door and...  You're all going to die!  Poltergeist 2.  Poltergeist 2.  That was it.  For the screen door.  That should have been your first clue.  Yeah.  And I'm standing next to...  And the marriage was more horrific than Poltergeist. 
[01:29:30]  And he actually said, is there anyone here who has any reason while these two being married?  And I...  Your hand was itching?  Itching?  I said, a reason?  I have a drill.  Where do I start?  The only reason a hand didn't go up is you and my brother were standing too close to each other  and kept bumping each other with the eyes that were going to go up.  Yeah.  So we finished.  You should have choked me out.  And we took the air conditioning trucks and we drove to the inn.  But we stopped at OTB to bet the Preakness on the way.  Had to bet the Preakness. 
[01:30:00]  Perfect.  Yeah.  So I went to my mom's bar, the bar she worked at.  Mm-hmm.  And, oh, it was all decked out.  Yeah.  All decorated up with crepe paper, I think, and free booze for everyone.  That was good.  So that was good.  And we had a big party.  And then back to the house.  Right.  And then after you guys left, we all took the over-under.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I'm sure.  We were figuring out how long this was going to last.  Why was there enough...  Left or passed out?  Was there a nice reception, at least? 
[01:30:30]  Like, were they...  Oh, it was fantastic within...  Every girl's dream.  Every girl's dream.  I mean, they did it right.  They shut the dartboard down.  It really was...  Yeah, yeah, I know.  Yeah, so...  I don't want any distractions.  We shot basketball game.  We took the balls away, so nobody, you know...  Yeah, it was really...  It was just a respect.  So nice.  It was so nice that once we got back to the house and the party really got underway.  And by party, I mean argument between my brand-new wife and mother.  Oh, man. 
[01:31:00]  Over what an ass my brother is.  That was fabulous.  Y'all ain't your mom, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Something to the effect of your son is a...  And this is my day.  My day.  I'm the f***ing bride.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, it was yelling.  It was girl yelling with alcohol, so...  Yeah.  You actually heard the yelling?  I heard tale of such.  It started, and we just kind of...  I was right there trying to like, hey, let's...  Ooh, let's...  Wow.  Let's dance.  And I actually felt kind of bad, because I was like, someone should help him.  And I said, well, it ain't going to be me.  No.  No.  But the good news after that day, you only had eight or nine years left, so...  Yeah.  And then another nine.  And then another nine.  Whatever became after the marriage, sir. 
[01:32:00]  Were you being fixed at Anthony?  Were you trying to fix it when that was the argument?  I was running around like a video game character trying to plug up, like, leaks.  I was...  I was just...  But I couldn't...  I couldn't do it.  It was...  I was trying to do damage control, and there was just too much damage being done.  There was...  You were Scotty in the engineering, and the place was burning.  Yeah, I can't do it!  It was done.  Burning.  And finally, I just decided, let me drink, to the point of just, you know, where I don't 
[01:32:30]  care about what's going on.  You were like the father in Boogie Nights that just sits there while the mother was yelling  at the kid.  Wow.  Drinking.  Yeah.  Just sitting there drinking.  Whatever.  What a day that was.  What a day.  Hey, Adam, we got some numbers coming in.  What do you got?  For the castle.  Oh, castle numbers?  $10,000 site fee, and then $200 of plate after that.  Yeah.  Holy mother of pearl.  Yeah.  You guys want to come?  It's going to be a door deal.  You're going to need a couple of more movies.  Yeah. 
[01:33:00]  You got to be kidding me.  You better hope for the Mall Cop sequel.  Yeah.  Because that...  Because...  I mean, that's not...  A site fee.  Yeah.  Come on.  A site fee.  Dude, it becomes about everyone else.  New York.  I know.  The wedding...  Missed his payment.  Sorry, I want to apologize for the wedding.  The wedding is not about you in the end.  Well, the whole...  It's about making everyone else happy.  The whole ring thing was like...  Because I go to buy...  Because I went to my brother.  He's like, go see my guy.  Everyone has a guy.  Everyone has a guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you go to see... 
[01:33:30]  So I go, you know, the back of the bowling alley is the guy.  Sure.  So you buy your ring.  So I get...  Actually, a buddy of ours, wife, hooked me up.  And she goes, what size is her hand?  Because, you know, the diamonds sit in the hand.  Who knows?  None of us know.  She goes, go home and look at the hand.  So she has an idea.  I'm looking at her hand at night.  And I'm like, oh, my God.  I'm marrying Dan Marino.  Look at the mitts on this kid.  Holy...  So I bought the ring.  And I asked her father permission.  I actually...  Wow.  Traditional.  Yeah. 
[01:34:00]  Like, so, like, his armies did invade my father's army's land or whatever it is.  And I'm thinking, if he says no, I'm like, well, then you've got to buy this ring, pal.  Because, you know how big that harbor-sealed daughter of yours is with that flipper?  So I asked him permission.  He actually says, he says, yes.  He goes, I'm very happy.  I know I don't look it.  But I'm very happy.  Wow.  Really?  That's kind of a...  He actually said that.  A little backhanded.  What is that?  I don't know.  I'll tell you what that is.  I'm glad she's getting married. 
[01:34:30]  I wish it were to a more successful comic book.  Oh, God.  I wish it were to Dennis.  Eat your grapefruit, you dick, you...  That's funny.  Damn.  That's very nice.  You asked the father, though, man.  A lot of people wouldn't...  You know, it's tradition.  You've got to ask the father.  Even if he's the same age as you.  You've still got to do it.  No, this guy's like...  Any position I've ever been in, I wouldn't have been able to find him.  You had to call the dad up.  Hey, kid, I've got a question. 
[01:35:00]  I can't take calls after 10.  He's slightly older.  Let's relax here.  I'd like to talk to you about something important.  Yes, Mr. Hughes?  Hey, it's Uncle Greg.  How are you?  We're pals.  Big Ken Bulls.  That's cool.  It's tough to call him my father-in-law.  He's Big Ken.  Yeah.  You know, it all works.  I like the chicks where the father's out of the picture anyway, so I never had to ask.  I knew I was doing something right with my girl because it was the first girl I went 
[01:35:30]  out with in many, many girls that had a father in the picture.  Let me tell you.  That's where you and I were similar.  We were always dating these broken girls that didn't have the father around.  It's okay because that doesn't come with any baggage.  No.  Father's Day.  It comes with a valet.  Father's birthday.  Christmas.  Should I go on?  It looked like when Fred Mertz tried to pack Ricky's car for the trip to California.  It's that much baggage. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, come on, Rick.  It'll stay.  Get in the house.  I'll pack it.  Get in the house.  The best one ever was.  Good, strong rope.  The best one ever was just a normal, wonderful day.  What's wrong?  It's the anniversary of him leaving our family.  Oh, how the F was I supposed to know that?  And you mark that on your calendar?  It's more accurate than the Aztec calendar watching tears come out of the light.  You know exactly what day it is.  Let me see. 
[01:36:30]  Those tears, snot bubbles, it must be Father's Day.  Right.  Enough of you.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Boo-hoo-hoo in my lap, you silly wounded goose.  Yeah.  This will make you feel better.  Drink up.  It's a I miss daddy shake.  Hey, I'm not saying there's free with one shut island.  I'm not saying there's no benefits.  I mean, you know, there are benefits.  Trust me.  The choking will take your mind off of it. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, my God.  Well, what are you going to do about it?  They're crying out of nowhere.  There's nothing about the pain.  And you go through your brain there, like, okay, wait, no holidays.  What could it possibly be now?  What is she crying about now?  Oh, it's got to be some daddy thing.  Oh, daddy.  Oh, enough.  But if they don't have daddy issues, I don't get to bang the hot ones.  It is to catch 22.  It is.  It's certainly, literally, to catch a girl that's 22.  Yeah.  You like my little hand motion I did? 
[01:37:30]  It's like boss when I find something.  You want daddy issues, they really help, because they make her vulnerable enough to actually  find something sexually attractive about me.  Yeah.  It's true.  As you're eating grapefruit, having this speech like De Niro in Blackheart with the egg,  they're like prey.  That's what we do.  You've got to tell me.  I'm from the same school of thought.  That's what you've got to do.  You've got to be funny guy.  Yeah.  I was all growing up. 
[01:38:00]  I've got to be funny guy.  Yeah.  Because, you know, half my diet was tetracycline from my pizza face, so I had to kind of be  funny.  It's like, excuse me, I'd love to kiss you, but let me pop this and come back.  Right.  Yeah, but you had it.  It's charming.  Don't look at this.  I'm struggling.  You also had that lead singer thing.  Well, that helped, too.  You had the band, too.  That doesn't hurt.  A band helped.  Believe me, I dove into everything but looks.  That's what I had to do.  Do you know what I said?  This is the truth.  Adam's a handsome dude.  Oh, the girl's just fawn over him.  Yeah. 
[01:38:30]  But growing up with you, you're a pain in the ass.  But he's hand-me-down bitches.  Hand-me-down?  I loved when you went out with my sister.  Okay.  This one bitch I didn't mind.  Oh, I had her already first.  Oh!  But the, uh, it's so-  On Father's Day.  I was saying to this girl recently that I'm sleeping with, I'm like, you don't get it.  It's like, girls always bang me because of the brain, the neck up.  It's like, that's what attracts them.  And I'm like, it's a constant game of keep her mentally stimulated. 
[01:39:00]  It is a constant, a constant, uh...  You're a mental plate spinner.  Exactly what it is because you're always afraid they're going to lose interest.  Yeah.  Because, you know, if you're good-looking enough, you can just lay there and be you.  Right.  But I never want them to focus on anything below the nipples.  Don't look down here.  Appendix scar, mush.  No.  Up, up.  Eyes.  Come here.  Come here.  There you go.  Stay with me.  Stay with me.  No, you did all right.  Yeah, no, you know, it was a lot of fun there. 
[01:39:30]  Why are you saying dead?  We got our stories.  He's doing.  All right.  Because now it's in a different, a whole different realm.  No, we're talking about broke-ass white trash going out in Huntington.  Yeah.  Going like the Dodger.  Yeah.  In our jackets.  The awful Dodger.  Just trying to bring home anything.  Stand like rock stars.  Yeah.  Trying to convey that, look, we're better than any guy in here.  Mm-hmm.  Believe me.  We just have to put that across to you. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, my God.  That was the toughie.  Yeah.  Houdini.  That was the tough nut to crack.  Believe me.  Gigs were easy.  Yeah, yeah.  Gigs are good.  Gigs are really easy.  That's why, you know, when you were the band or something, when Adam started going out  and doing comedy, Jesus Christ, he'd get down on a show, we'd go out to the bar, and  a little harem would just come around.  Adam, these giggling girls would come out.  Oh, you're so funny.  Hey, how you doing?  I'm his pal.  Let's go to the apartment.  You like rock and rock. 
[01:40:30]  It was the same thing.  It was the same thing.  It was the same thing.  It was the same thing.  It was the same thing.  It was the same thing.  It was the same thing.  He'd do the, when the band played, he did that, and he would always make his entrance,  like, because your brother came out, Joe Buck would come out, and then Foote would  come out.  Yeah.  And then he, like, came out at the end, like, David Lee.  I had to wait.  Yeah.  He's just wait.  What did Foote play?  Keyboards.  Keyboards, yeah.  He's a keyboard player in his mother's dress.  Why?  Just to make it more difficult to get laid.  Yeah, exactly.  That's an attention getter.  Yeah.  It was...  And it was his mom's dress?  I never knew that.  Oh, yes.  Who else would he wear? 
[01:41:00]  It would be ghoulish if it was somebody who didn't know.  He'd go to Laid.  Yeah.  The band was tight.  Well, which band?  I mean, it was a bunch of them, the last one.  That was it.  I had to stay in bands the entire time.  It was, like, just this, like, everybody was...  It was a band gangbang.  Yeah.  You had the East Islip crew, and then our guys, and other guys, and we'd constantly be  trading players.  It's like the little rascals.  I got a horn.  Yeah.  And then we'd just, you know, find enough guys, get it together, practice a few times,  go out, and hope to get laid, because that was pretty much the goal. 
[01:41:30]  Money wasn't it, that's for sure.  And I played the lights.  Yes.  He makes a lightboard out of, like, Professor makes a lightboard out of an Atari game with  the knife switches, and he's got to hook it to the 220 with jumper cables.  So before he's, like, he's going in the back, he's unscrewing the service in the bar, and  he's got these giant Lilco gloves on.  Are you serious?  I wanted to be safe.  Yeah.  And he's convincing me that everything's going to be fine.  I'm like, don't be too short, Ralph.  I ain't got no Lilco gloves. 
[01:42:00]  Don't worry.  I step it down to 110 from the 220, so you don't have to worry about a thing.  And he's explaining this to me like, I know.  Yeah.  And I said, oh, well, he stepped it down.  The switch must be fine now.  That's going to be good, right.  God damn it.  You made your own lights?  Oh, yeah.  Damn.  I'd be at home with a soldering iron, just putting together dimmer packs and light systems.  It was like Ted Kaczynski.  He was, like, in a shack.  He's a mad scientist.  And just building stuff.  Made a bazooka.  Remember the bazooka I used to fire at the drum set? 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  For real?  Oh, yeah.  And the grenade launcher.  This was before, you know.  Now you fire at 20-year-olds.  It was a different time back then.  Sure.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  We've got Adam Farrar.  Adam, what are you promoting?  Governors?  We've got Gotham, February 19th through the 22nd.  Wait, 19th through the February.  February 19th, okay.  I've got this.  I had some time.  I wanted to come see you guys.  AdamFarrar.com, too, for all your dates. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  And congrats on the movie, man.  Thank you, pal.  That's huge, man.  I hope it starts doing better.  Yeah.  Christ.  We'll continue with Adam in a minute.  Opie and Anthony.  We've got Adam Farrar in studio.  Very good to see him.  Hiya, pal.  He calls me pal now, eh?  I like that.  Hey, we're all pals there.  It's about time.  I've only known you 14 years.  Hey. 
[01:43:30]  You came with Anthony.  I figured that one out a long time ago.  And I met first time in L.A.  Hey, let's go see my pal, Adam.  Remember that?  Yeah.  And we're all just hanging out in a hotel room.  We're just fun.  We're newbies to the entertainment business for the most part, and Adam's giving us all  sorts of advice.  This is what you've got to do.  Adam was the first one out of the shoot back growing up.  He was the guy that took the plunge, had the crappy jobs with us, you know, all that  garbage, and then took the plunge and said, I'm going to be a comedian. 
[01:44:00]  And we're like, all right.  We'll see you back at work Monday, whatever.  He never returned.  And the guy never came back.  He moved out to California.  Yeah, they don't tell you it wasn't that easy.  I'm going to be a comedian.  And this guy, I'm going to be a cowboy.  Yeah.  But, yeah, he was the first one out of the gate.  And it's got to be said, I mean, Adam's stand-up is awesome.  Oh, yeah.  It's hysterical.  I've never heard a bad word about the guy. 
[01:44:30]  Like, business-wise, professionally, it's disgusting.  Here's what I'm happy.  Big scandal when I'm 50.  Is that what you're going to do?  Ponzi scheme?  Something, yeah.  You're one of those comedians that people listen to every word.  And that sounds kind of weird to say, but there are some comedians you go see, and you know you could spend some time doing a little chatter, even though you shouldn't, or checking your phone, or whatever.  But with Adam, I notice everyone really just listens to every single word and really focuses on what you're doing up there. 
[01:45:00]  You could pretty much, not figuratively, tell a girl she's being a C, the C word, and be charming about it.  Yeah.  It's disgusting.  You got the charm, Adam.  Oh, well, you're too kind, all of you.  But you tell a very, very good story that, you know, has many, many funny parts.  You spin a good yarn.  That's right.  Good tale.  You could see for yourself.  Look at this.  Gotham Comedy Club.  You know why?  Because he's got a passion for what he's saying.  Because unfortunately, sometimes unfortunately, it's true. 
[01:45:30]  These stories are true that you hear from.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  Like, you can't say that.  It's got to come out.  It happened.  Yeah.  For example?  You know, family stuff.  Fun stuff like that.  I remember when you were on the other station, and I called in, and my mother left a message.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Some American Comedy Award, something.  My mother left a message.  She's like, I'm so, I got diarrhea or something, and I played the message on the air.  Yeah. 
[01:46:00]  And, like, she didn't know, you know, she didn't know Anthony was on the radio, but she didn't  know how far-reaching it was.  And everyone was asking her about her stomach.  How do you feel?  How's your stomach?  You feeling better?  I'm like, I don't know.  But everyone is asking me.  That's all of it.  Well, that was our parents, too, during the whole thing.  And I think my mother's just getting over it.  Right.  The fact that, you know, no, this is my job.  For so long, they just never understood what...  They thought we were still in your kitchen videotaping.  Oh, I wish some of those would surface. 
[01:46:30]  When are they going to grow?  Wow.  I think you have them.  I might have had them.  I think they ended up in a fire back in 98.  Oh, really?  Eight.  Oh, really?  Along with everything else.  What the F?  I think she burnt everything of mine.  Me and fires with these relationships.  Jesus Christ.  Give that.  They smoke you the bear when I break.  Buy a grand theft auto.  Yes, a little bit of that.  Whatever.  God.  It's not just hurt feelings.  It's felonies involved.  When women are done with you, they want their soul to be sucked up.  Yes.  You have such a burning sage waving it around them. 
[01:47:00]  He must have a hell of a piece.  He does.  He does.  The girls realize, oh my God, I'm not going to have that piece anymore.  They just lose their effing minds.  No, they just want...  You ever see Roy Rogers' cowboy walk out?  You go way back with it, Ant.  Have you seen his piece?  Years ago.  Really?  Where?  Yeah.  Remember the gig up in the college gig?  When you ripped your phone?  When I beat up the pay phone?  You had the phone surgically implanted in your hand?  Yeah.  Why would you beat up a phone? 
[01:47:30]  Well, I was Kennedy drunk.  Oh, we were...  Me.  All right.  At least I didn't have...  I go to commercial.  No.  All right.  We just got back from commercial.  Yeah.  All right.  At least I didn't have...  Coming out of my room.  All right.  All right.  Wait.  What was it?  Cloverfield.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Adam hooked up that night.  Really?  Did you pull a fatty?  Hooked up with Moby Dick.  That's funny.  But the funniest thing was like... 
[01:48:00]  There's nothing wrong with that.  Everyone's sleeping in it because it was a little...  Oh, he tried so hard.  But both bands were there and they were all strewn out.  It was like Jonestown after the Kool-Aid, just laying.  And I'm trying to get her out, which is pretty much like a circus act, trying to get the  elephant to walk through the little thing.  Yeah.  How big?  How big?  She was a fatty.  Yeah.  You look at her and you just went...  You didn't go like, oh, she'd be cute if she was...  You look and went, all right, he was just chubby chasing.  No, no.  She was cute.  She was...  I don't know how cute. 
[01:48:30]  I was just looking at the body.  Okay.  She was fast.  You're the hottest guy she ever banged.  Like, she's still...  Oh, my God.  Still...  Yeah.  You're the one that got away.  Yeah.  Got away.  Ran away.  So they're all laying there, right?  I get them out the door.  I open up the door.  And they're all laying in wait.  Yeah.  Like little snipers.  Nice.  They're not saying anything.  I shut the door.  I say goodbye.  I actually think I get away with...  They don't wait until I turn around.  They wait until I get to my bedroom door.  And then all of a sudden, the alarm goes off like...  We saw her. 
[01:49:00]  Fatty Chubby Chase.  What'd you do?  What'd she eat?  She ate the bass player.  Good one.  All right.  Let me say hi to Bruce in Louisiana.  He's got something for Adam.  Bruce, what's up?  Yeah.  I just wanted to tell Adam how much I love him.  He's one of my favorite comedians.  And he came up with my favorite term.  I use it all the time.  What?  I'm not 100% sure if I can say it on the radio, though.  Oh, give me a shot.  Somebody will.  It's not Adams.  Somebody will hear it.  It's pissed bitch. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I love that.  Well, it's used in the angered term.  Yes.  Like when you say you're pissed off, you know?  You're angry.  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's why I love the show.  Shut up.  No, go ahead, sir.  Jimmy is such an instigating ass.  Because I get so annoyed.  It's annoyed, and I love it.  No, but then when they just start stepping on him, he'll be going to say something, and 
[01:50:00]  they just have no idea that he's coming.  I can see him.  He's coming around third, and he's got his eye on home, and all of a sudden the mascot  runs out and stands on the baseline.  Yeah, but you're in the back poking the mascot.  Go ahead.  It's fine.  Get the t-shirt gun.  Get the t-shirt.  They'll make you a part of it.  Oh, it's hysterical.  Well, what if...  Oh, my God.  Anything else, Bruce?  Budinsky.  What were you saying?  No, that's it.  I did.  Thank you, Bruce.  Thank you.  There goes Bruce.  That's funny. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  That's when you come in, and you know that there's a problem going on in your relationship.  The chick is mad at you or whatever, and Adam will say, you know, there's just  this pissed mist hanging around the house.  It's a fog and a werewolf movie.  Yeah.  You just...  It's a feeling when you walk in.  Yeah.  You know that feeling.  You know.  I'm in trouble somehow.  I did something.  Don't know what it is.  I don't...  But I know something's off.  The worst is the car, because you've got nowhere to go.  You're driving home after something happens.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:51:00]  You get that no talking thing going on?  Or they tsk at you.  So, did you have a good time?  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Here it comes.  Where are we?  There we go.  Where is it?  I'm aiming for a tree.  What does Nav say where we are?  Where is this?  What did I do now?  We're miles from happiness.  Miles.  Can I punch bliss into the Nav system here?  Can we do something here?  Can you navigate me to bliss? 
[01:51:30]  Because this ain't it.  Yeah.  Can I make a left that I swear, honey, I don't know what I did?  Am I the only one now that as soon as there's a weird vibe, the first thing I think is she  cracked the computer password?  That's funny.  I didn't clear my history.  Oh, my God.  Damn cookies.  How do I explain?  I was a photographer for Geranimals. 
[01:52:00]  Okay, listen.  You know I'm a big fan of Pete Townsend.  Yeah.  Doing research.  Sometimes that camera just goes off.  God damn.  Yeah.  Well, that's good.  I'm glad you're getting married.  You're Dawn, of course, my sister Dawn.  Yes.  I was dating Adam many years ago.  Many, many years ago.  But she is now a mother.  I know.  Congratulations.  Congratulations.  Look at that.  Roe must be going crazy.  Oh, she is.  Because she was the mother's child or not.  She's just going crazy. 
[01:52:30]  I'm convinced of that one.  Yeah.  She wanted to be a grandmother forever.  Yeah.  And it pretty much took that.  Yeah.  Forever.  Well, she got two at the same time.  Now she is.  More or less.  Yeah.  Pretty much.  Two months apart.  But I am Little Warren Dean.  Warren Dean.  Sounds like he's going to be indicted for Watergate.  The guy from Nick.  The Nixon council guy?  Yeah.  Little Warren Dean.  Okay.  That's his name.  Little Warren Dean.  And his brother G. Gordon.  Yeah.  And G. Gordon Liddy is coming over for his first birthday.  And the christening is coming up. 
[01:53:00]  And I indeed am the godfather.  Good for you.  I myself am a godfather.  Have I mentioned?  I'm a godfather.  Yes, I am.  Godfather loves you.  So I got to do all that on Sunday after, what, Valentine's Day?  Can you have to touch the baby and hold it?  Yeah.  You can do that.  No, you don't have to touch it, really.  It's like the last scene of the godfather when they're killing, Michael's killing everybody.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he's standing up there.  Yeah, that's all.  Yeah.  You know, I'll be armed.  That's it.  Time again.  That scene doesn't get the credit it deserves, man, in Godfather 3. 
[01:53:30]  I know.  That scene is amazing, because everyone thinks the movie stinks.  He means Godfather, I think.  No, the original one.  The original one.  Michael's standing Godfather 2.  Carlo and Connie's baby.  Fantastic.  Yeah.  You denounce Satan with all his...  Yeah.  And he's just having everyone killed at that moment.  I do renounce him.  Yeah.  At that moment, Fat Clemenza's huffing and puffing with a shotgun.  Yeah.  Mo Green gets the worst shot in the eye ever for him.  And then red tempera paint falls out of his head.  And he slowly lowers it back like it's nap time, man. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, just take a nap, you goddamn guineas.  What scene am I thinking of in Godfather 3?  I'm such an idiot.  Dude, I saw it one time.  I don't remember.  I know.  I saw it one time.  What am I thinking?  Sofia Coppola's merciful shooting?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Which wasn't in the script.  They just did it because she was annoying people.  Should have thrown my wig in front of her.  Bullet crew.  Got a Kevlar wig.  Maybe if she was wearing my lifts, the bullet would have went between her legs. 
[01:54:30]  Missed her completely.  People saying perhaps the archbishop hanging from the bridge.  All right.  Yeah.  Is that one of them?  Sure.  Yeah.  There's a lot of religious stuff going on in that one.  Ah.  I'm dying on my bench.  Doesn't he just keel over on a bench or something?  I don't remember.  I kind of remember that.  He dies on his feet, on his lifts, but he can't, because his lifts is all high.  He just kind of tips over like a dandelion.  Tipped over. 
[01:55:00]  He tips over like that little, you know the game you used to have a little doll?  You push the button.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You just want to call lapses.  Yeah.  Like one of those swans with the top hat drinking.  I'm going to tip my wig to you like Jeffrey Tambor at the end of Dog Day Afternoon.  And Justice for All.  Wrong movie.  Oh, no.  Boo.  What else is going on?  Another slow news day.  We've got the snow in New York.  I want to get a righteous kill now, and I got it. 
[01:55:30]  Someone's got to get it.  Yeah.  Freeze frame the scene where Pacino dies.  Oh, thanks.  And no, no.  You just wish it was you instead.  Because you actually start looking through the movie box for the hour and 45 minutes you wasted.  Did they replace this?  Hey, rooster, Turk.  Turk the rooster.  But you've got to look for the lifts on his shoes.  You want to just snuggle with them.  His big lifts.  Yeah, with his...  Got to freeze frame that and see it.  I got to see that.  I want to make a poster out of it. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, fantastic.  My lifts.  We're obsessed with how short Pacino is.  How tall is...  Somebody get my wig.  Where's my wig?  Where's my wig?  Yeah.  Hoo-ah.  Somebody pick me up so I can order my breakfast.  He's a twerp.  And they're not even...  Man, we've talked about it before.  Legendary actors.  I mean, just watch them go down the crapper like that.  That 88 minutes. 
[01:56:30]  It was good.  Yeah, fantastic.  I didn't even see it.  Yeah.  I didn't even see it.  It was right.  I saw...  I just saw a bunch of...  Did you get the screeners?  Oh, yeah.  We always do.  I got a couple.  Did you see Benjamin Button?  Yeah.  That should be a zipper so it's over quicker.  Oh, really?  Really?  It goes on and on and on.  I get it.  I get it.  Did you not like Benjamin Button?  Real time.  I did not like Benjamin Button.  The concept was good, but it fell short.  I'm with Adam.  It was correct.  It fell short. 
[01:57:00]  The movie needed to be a half hour shorter easily.  It could have been a documentary.  And then it might have been a much better movie.  A History Channel documentary would have been fine.  Oh, look how cool he looks there and then you're done.  Yeah, but it's...  He's living life backwards.  Yeah.  That's the kind of way I'm growing.  I was born really tall.  And now I'm shrinking.  Shrinking into oblivion.  Yeah.  It's up for a lot of Oscars.  I don't know why.  It wasn't that good.  Hey, did you see Mulk?  No, I did not see Mulk.  I have Mulk at home.  Mulk was...  Mulk was good?  Yeah.  I saw a Frost Nixon I liked. 
[01:57:30]  I liked it, too.  Yeah, you liked that one?  I did like that one.  Yeah, it was cool to see someone playing...  No, he looked nothing like him.  Frank Langelli was Dracula.  I know.  That's all I remember.  And Sherlock Holmes.  He was Sherlock Holmes.  I didn't remember that one, but as Nixon, he's got an English accent or something.  Even though...  Does he?  I don't even know.  No, I...  Hold it off.  He just doesn't look like the guy.  What about Slumdog?  Slumdog, I haven't seen yet.  Oh, we just saw it two days ago.  Ed's going to probably see it tonight.  Yeah.  I had to go for comedy.  That movie's going to win a lot of freaking Oscars. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  They're protesting big time over Slumdog Millionaire.  Oh, yes, in India.  I guess that's a slang for people who live in...  But they did live in garbage dumps in India.  It's probably like using the N-word here.  Yeah.  But they're called Slumdwellers in Bihar's capital.  We're protesting against the movie that demanded the filmmaker remove the word dog from the title.  But I don't think he's calling them dogs.  It's the same guy who did Trainspotty, I think, right?  Oh, is it the same guy?  I believe so. 
[01:58:30]  Is that him, Danny?  Is it really?  Yeah.  I don't know if he did Trainspotty.  I know he was the guy behind 28 Days Later.  Yes, he was.  Your head is totally red now.  Yeah.  It's cool.  Visual joke.  Danny's wearing a red cap, mind you, and he bumped his head in a car accident this morning.  Yes.  Thank you.  You did?  Yes.  I certainly did.  Danny now looks at the tip of a dog's penis.  Oh, you can keep it on.  Put that back.  Really?  You all right?  Yeah, I guess.  You don't really know the signs. 
[01:59:00]  Pull your head down over it.  Yeah.  Gosh, yeah.  That's a big red bump, man.  Yeah.  You took a nice hit this morning.  Anyway, guys, so they're protesting.  Badly, they want the word dog taken out, but slumdog, I think, is probably the slang  used by upper cast people for the lower cast.  So I think it's a sarcastic.  It's not knocking them at all.  It is.  Adam, what was your favorite movie of the year?  Well, I still want to reserve the rights.  Mall Cop?  Mall Cop, yes.  Mall Cop.  Of all the movies you saw so far?  Of all the movies I saw so far, I liked, and out of the three I saw, I didn't like Revolutionary 
[01:59:30]  Road, so I'm going to go.  Oh, you still haven't seen it?  I'm going to see it today.  I didn't like it.  Dude, how depressed?  Why do you need to feel that depressed?  Yeah.  I hated that movie.  I was watching.  I was watching.  You should not watch those.  Why?  He gets depressed easily?  Who doesn't?  Are you a sad boy out?  You cried a little bit?  I cry on the inside.  Do you have sad eyes?  Sometimes.  Sometimes, yeah.  I turn the other way.  I get pissed.  Yeah.  I get angry. 
[02:00:00]  I'm like, I don't need to feel this emotion.  I want to escape.  I got a lot of problems.  I don't mind feeling emotions when you go to a theater, but Revolutionary Road takes  it to a place.  It's like, all right, I get it.  Why dream of anything?  No one should dream of anything.  I don't want to ruin it for you because it's miserable.  You're just going to end up in a house and in a little nowhere living a mundane life.  I hate sad movies.  I got my own problems.  I dress like a Sandinista.  Idiot.  I didn't think I got my mental patient. 
[02:00:30]  I want to sit there and get all freaked out over a movie.  Now that it's out on the table, General.  Yeah.  I know.  I dress like G.I. Joe.  How nice was the secretary's boobies, though, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  Anybody want to see Che with Benicio Del Toro filmed an actual time of his life,  apparently?  Four hours and 17 minutes, those pompous asses.  Are you kidding me?  They're showing it in two parts, and you could buy a ticket for part one.  You can't even buy a ticket for the whole movie.  Maybe you can.  I just want to buy it for part two. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  And then see if you can figure out what that is.  The artsy theater has it part one and then part two.  It's basically two separate movies, huh?  Is that a duplex?  It's the artsy and fartsy theater.  Thank you.  Part one and artsy.  I have a mouse show coming up.  Part two will be held in the fartsy wing.  The fartsy.  Fartsy wing.  He walked out of a press conference because they were asking him two tougher questions.  I like him as an actor, but it's like just another...  Stop trying to make statements.  These babies in Hollywood try to get political, and then they're called out by people that  know more than they do, and they've got to sulk and walk away. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  Shut up.  Word.  Shut up.  Four hours and 17 minutes.  Word.  That's crazy.  What's the matter with you?  You know what's more of an outrage?  I think he had sex with Scarlett Johansson in an elevator.  In an elevator.  I heard that, too.  God, is that annoying.  I know.  Lucky girl.  Oh, yeah.  She's...  She's slutty.  Yeah, not as hot as she used to be.  What?  She's fantastic.  What?  She's losing a little bit.  What?  She's lost nothing.  I'm the only one?  Yes.  A little bit.  She's fantastic.  A little bit?  A little bit.  What?  A little bit.  A little bit. 
[02:02:00]  No, you're showing me the...  Danny's already all over it.  Well, these pictures, yeah, amazing.  Well, you can say that about Dakota Fanning, too.  Scarlett Johansson, 2009.  Ever since she got a driver's license.  That's a recent picture.  Is it?  What year is that picture?  Look at that goddamn picture.  Then I'm insane.  Then I'm insane.  It bites your tongue.  What is she losing?  You know what?  Sometimes you've got to cut your losses.  I will openly admit I just lost the battle.  Holy crap.  Is that really the latest picture?  Pretty close?  I don't know if it's, like, really recent, but I will find one, and I guarantee you she 
[02:02:30]  looks just as good as this picture.  She's wonderful.  My favorite.  She is dressed, legally, dressed in that picture.  That's my favorite right there.  Which one?  And it's completely shackable.  This is my favorite Scarlett Johansson picture ever.  Maybe we can put it on onaradio.com.  That one?  Yeah, with the long sweater that's completely open.  Holy mother of God.  Oh, my God.  Holy Jesus Palomino.  What'd you add?  Oh, no, never.  Never.  Ew, right?  I would kick my girl into an elevator shaft.  Oh.  To bang her.  Beat it. 
[02:03:00]  Wow.  Oh, that one's good, too.  What's that?  What's that?  Right there.  Get it.  Get it.  Right there.  You're just about on it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  There you go.  I'm a fan of the little clothes.  Me, too.  A hat.  Go to the naked one.  Put on your socks.  I still lost that battle.  What's that one in the middle, Dan?  She's naked.  That's not her.  That's a Photoshop, Jimmy.  Oh.  Yeah, that's Photoshop.  God, those are nice breasts.  You could use that, though.  You could have those. 
[02:03:30]  That would be usable.  Cut and paste.  Fat, heavy one.  Take them with you.  All right.  So full of...  Take that with you.  Put that on the eye.  Here, these are for you.  You could pick heavy feeders.  See, if I was home, that right there would turn into just hours of perusing pornography.  Yeah.  That's all it would take, right?  That's all it would take.  That's your tipping point?  It's like, Scarlett Johansson, let me take a look at it.  We'll pop that in.  And then it would just end up in, you know, videos of...  David Johansson.  David Johansson.  You get to those video sites where it's just... 
[02:04:00]  When the categories come up and they're all, you know, you know the favorites.  And it starts with A, amateur, ends with zebras, zoology, whatever.  You're expecting medical advice on horses?  Yes.  You suck the poison out, don't you?  Look at that.  A day at the races.  Oh, yeah.  What's better than a bestiality film when the dog's panting?  You ever hear the dog...  I'm always amazed they know what to do, even though, you know, it's pretty much the same 
[02:04:30]  motion and stuff, but that they know, like, ah, there's no fur there.  Yeah.  They just kind of know what to do.  They recognize the same stupid pose.  I guess so.  We'll ponder that thought.  We're going to take a quick break.  Probably smell.  AdamFarrar.com for tour dates, but the Biggie Gotham Comedy Club, February 19th through  the 22nd.  Thanks, buddy.  Yes.  And Mall Cop.  And Mall Cop, yeah.  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  It's a snow day.  Yeah.  We should go home, man. 
[02:05:00]  What?  Let's just go home.  No, not yet.  I'm waiting until everything clears out.  It stops snowing, right?  Nah, we'll do a little more radio for everybody.  I'm having too much fun doing radio today.  Without a furor.  Yes.  I've been on the dumbest schedule, but apparently it seems to be working.  What is it?  Uh, I get home and I immediately go to sleep.  Yeah.  And I sleep later and later every day.  Uh-oh.  Uh, yesterday I woke up at 8 p.m. 
[02:05:30]  Right.  And went to bed at like noon, one around there?  I went to sleep right when I got home.  It was about one o'clock.  I slept until 8 p.m.  Straight through.  And then I was up until 2 in the morning.  And then a little nap.  And then a little nap.  I'm in.  I got a burly.  Right.  I'm in because I was pretty wide awake.  I don't know if it leaves me any time for a social life whatsoever. 
[02:06:00]  But it's working for you.  That's why I sit around wearing cartoon character one set of clothes in my closet.  It's sleep deprivation.  Pretty much.  That's a nice schedule for yourself.  It's perfect.  And then tomorrow he comes in and goes, listen, I took a little nap.  I got up.  I addressed the troops.  Yeah.  I walked around.  I fell asleep in front of the...  Oops, sorry.  I had to give PalTalk there a little...  Oh.  I fell asleep in front of the PalTalk camera one day.  And Keith decided... 
[02:06:30]  He came in and decided to just bare his ass right next to my head.  Well, he has to.  For all to screen cap.  It was a wonderful day.  That's funny.  I fell asleep with the military channel on last night.  Like, hit with bodyguards.  Oh, that drunk.  Oh, yeah.  And I'm having these weird dreams of being on a train and it's bulletproof.  Yeah, when you fall asleep to the military channel, you'll have some weird-ass dreams.  And then you wake up and...  That's the oddest thing, too.  You fall asleep to one thing and you think it's safe. 
[02:07:00]  Mm-hmm.  And you wake up...  I woke up to, like, softcore porno the other day.  And I was watching, I don't know, like that movie where the kids are stuck in the airport  for Christmas.  Sure you were.  That is fair.  Why would you like that?  Sure you were.  Well, I was using that as an example of what wouldn't be on any channel that might have  porno later.  I was like, what is this?  You know, Cinema 100?  Cinema 100?  They show the movies during the day that are good and then the night...  Yeah, there it is.  There's me asleep.  Yeah, but we could have taken Ant's word for it. 
[02:07:30]  I didn't need to see this.  And Keith's ass.  We got the screen cap of Keith mooning the camera as Anthony is asleep.  Taking a little snooze on the couch.  Sorry, it was a coordinated effort.  That's funny.  Yeah, yeah.  Keith had to call me and it was just like...  Oh, yeah, it was a conspiracy.  Oh, that's smart.  He's like, Ant's sleeping.  I'm going to put my ass in the camera.  Okay, tell me when you're ready.  Tell me when you're ready.  Tell me when you're ready.  I'm like, okay, go, go, go.  He's on the phone.  He's like, you got it?  You got it? 
[02:08:00]  Oh, I only wish I would have woke up and shot him in the ass.  I still think that the other photo is actually better.  The upside down one?  Yeah, where you almost spilled like a gallon of wine all over everything.  Oh, it's a side shot of me sleeping on the couch with a nice glass of wine tipped over, almost falling in my lap.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  It's nice balancing act.  Look at Jimmy go, yeah, that's great.  You don't think that's a warning sign?  Passed out with half a glass of balanced wine?  No, it's scotch-corded.  Oh, okay.  Of course not.  I understand.  Just throw the couch out, Adam. 
[02:08:30]  What's wrong with you?  Exactly.  That's for boogers.  I haven't spoken in a while.  Fine.  All right?  You're wearing military clothes and you're passing out drunk.  Come on over, pal.  Hey, come on over.  Let's get out of here.  I was napping, by the way, drunk.  Not passing out drunk.  I understand.  There's a difference, you know.  Much better.  One is on the couch, the other is on the bathroom floor.  We're into their music marathon.  Oh.  That's way more important.  Sorry.  You got a good song to start that off there?  Danny? 
[02:09:00]  Uh, why, of course we do.  It's get the lead out.  Ah.  Mm.  Uh.  Why are we getting the lead out today?  Because it's Tuesday.  Wednesday.  It's Wednesday?  What are you doing Wednesdays?  Wait, Wednesday they get the lead out?  Yeah, it's some kind of lead lunch, right?  It's not lunchtime.  9.  9.  Oh, 4 in the morning.  Well, you're getting missed.  Robert.  Robert.  Hop, anyway.  Oh, all right.  Well, thank God.  Adam Ferrara, thank you.  AdamFerrara.com.  Good seeing you guys.  Gotham Country Club.  Gotham Comedy Club.  The 19th through the 22nd of February. 
[02:09:30]  Good seeing you guys.  And we're going to continue over to the other church.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Indeed.  See you guys tomorrow.  See you guys tomorrow. 
[02:10:00]  All right. 
[02:10:30]  Can you hear me now?  You know what?  I can't do a show this way.  Let's just go home.  No.  We can stay here.  No, let's just go home.  No, we can't.  I'm in big trouble.  Dan, what are you doing?  I got headphones.  Oh, Dan, what are you affecting?  It sounds very tinny and awful, right?  Why do I have headphones?  That's weird, right?  I shouldn't.  We're on wirelesses.  I shouldn't.  Wirelesses. 
[02:11:00]  Well, how about who's here?  Do you have headphones?  I can't hear him.  This isn't a best though.  Who are you?  Oh, Adam Ferrara.  Hi, Adam.  Yeah, but I can't.  This is like, Watson, come here.  I need you.  It sounds like a tin can.  Oh, well, that was getting a little better or something.  That's okay.  That was weird.  No, because I'm turning up the volume to get volume for my wireless.  Are you?  And I'm turning up your volume, I think.  Okay.  Yeah.  How about we play another little bit?  Who's here from engineering?  Anyone?  No, Mars is out today.  Oh, fuck.  We're going home early.  Because I... 
[02:11:30]  This is going to be a pain in the ass for everybody.  What are we doing?  Obi, I don't even know what we're doing.  I'm frightened.  Jimmy's all frightened now.  No one can hear me.  He's frightened.  That sounds like a ham radio.  It's like CB.  I had phones and phones.  CB radio.  Oh, yours are good?  Yours are good?  No, no, no.  Mine sounds like CB radio.  Oh, really?  It's very tinny.  Breaker, Breaker.  Um, wow.  You got the Wrangler.  Hey.  Talk to me, my boy.  I think, uh...  Where are you, Dreamweaver?  You got your ears on?  I'm up here doing what I'm supposed to be doing. 
[02:12:00]  What y'all doing?  He-ing and she-ing?  Why isn't Mars here today?  It's always better when that's one person.  What's she wearing now?  It's always better when he and she is one person.  You know how it is.  Why isn't Mars here?  He's actually got a fucking...  He's having surgery on his asshole.  Get the ass to Mars.  Did Mars fuck up everything just to show that we need him when he's not here?  That's a good way to keep your job, though.  I understand everyone got nervous when, you know, Poe was shown the door.  Gentlemen.  We miss Poe.  We wish him nothing but the best, but... 
[02:12:30]  Now I'm thinking Mars is, like, sabotaging, because he's like,  Look, I gotta make sure people realize I'm important.  We're a victim of sabotaging.  Right.  Mars is definitely part of the war effort.  Essential to the war effort.  It's very important.  I'm essential, are you?  I know the code is essential, but whatever.  Yeah.  You got the point.  Yeah.  How about we play a little bit and try to figure this out?  Could they send over an engineer from, you know, the big office?  Oh, I don't think that would happen.  Is that asking too much?  That would come out in this weather. 
[02:13:00]  I don't...  Let me give it a shot.  Hold on.  I'll be the arbiter.  Wow.  You sound okay.  Arbiter.  Seriously.  Huh?  I just plugged into yours and it sounds fine.  Oh, you got mine back?  Yes.  Go ahead.  Try that.  Sweet.  Because I get...  Danny, my headphones won't go in.  I gotta take this and fix it.  Give it a fixin'.  Hold on.  We're fixin'.  I'm gonna put them on my head.  I'm back.  Now I'm gonna turn the volume up.  I'm back.  A little bit.  I'm back.  You're back.  I'm back.  All right.  Now I'm there and I'm fine.  I can't hear nothing.  Yeah, we're all good.  I can't hear nothing.  What, Jimmy?  I can't hear you.  I can hear me. 
[02:13:30]  What?  Hello?  All is good.  All right.  Yeah, thank you.  Thank God that worked out.  Yeah.  For a minute, I thought you were gonna have to leave early.  Yes.  That would have sucked.  Who'd I go home and sleep after an hour's sleep last night?  Not me.  I'd rather just touch my aching dick.  I fuck until the pussy is just dry and bored.  I really do.  I'm like getting a gum job from someone eating peanut butter.  Holy shit.  That's dry.  I know. 
[02:14:00]  I want to thank Danny for being a company man and fixing everything.  We were this close to getting a few hours.  Thanks, Dan.  Fucking goody two-shoes.  What a goody gum job.  I'm working at 7-Eleven.  What the fuck, Danny?  I know.  Haven't you learned anything from us?  You know how long it took me to break this?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't break stuff anymore.  I'm happy, man.  Sorry.  Sorry to disappoint people, but I don't break as much stuff.  We were trying to be lazy.  Wait.  I was kicking stuff yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sorry.  You power slammed the CD player with your foot. 
[02:14:30]  If I remember.  If I do recall.  We found the John Montone thing from earlier.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  John Montone.  John, he's on 1010 Winds, a news station here in New York, and because of the snow this  morning, he's that guy they send out, the man on the street, and they send him out to  perhaps the crappiest, the salters, the guys that do it with the salt and plow, and a guy  will comment like, yeah, well, we're going to have the plows out all morning. 
[02:15:00]  Plows out all morning.  Indeed.  Indeed.  I'm John Montone.  And, yeah, so what do you think of this wintry weather?  Well, it makes it a little harder to get into work.  I had to bundle up today.  Bundle up indeed.  John Montone, 1010 Winds.  And this morning, he just went off script to yell at somebody.  Yeah.  This is like happy John Montone.  He does the happy stories.  But not today.  No, he was very angry.  No, he does the lousy stories, but he does them positively. 
[02:15:30]  Yes.  He's like happy about the positive stories.  You put it in perspective.  A pile of dog shit no one has cleaned up.  I'm standing in it.  Pooper scooper indeed.  Yeah.  So here he is.  Blast.  He's calling Harry Chapin.  Now, most drivers were taking it slow, except for this pinhead in a Honda.  70 miles per hour in the snow on 287, passing a tractor trailer in the right lane.  Buddy, if you're still alive, slow down. 
[02:16:00]  John Montone, 1010 Winds.  In West Nyack.  Buddy, if you're still alive.  He's still alive.  70 miles an hour, and he's still alive.  They hit him with five shots, and he's still alive.  Five speeds shifting, and he's still alive.  You don't want to get under his skin.  Wow.  What do you call him, buddy?  Yeah, pinhead.  Pinhead, and then buddy.  Look, buddy.  If you're still alive.  He's like Richie Cunningham when he gets angry. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, yeah.  Bucko.  Look out, bucko.  To the cunt face in the Honda.  That's what he should have said.  I know.  Dr. Cuckoo is...  Cuckoo.  Cuckoo.  Cuckoo.  Cuckoo is going to be on Fox in a minute here.  Fox News.  Is he?  Turn on Fox in a minute.  What's the end of the world?  Nope.  I don't want to know when he meets you, Cuckoo.  No, he's a good dude.  Nice.  Is it the end of the world?  No, he's the type of guy you don't want to know what he knows.  I always want to know what he knows.  Nope.  He knows very important stuff.  Nope.  That we should know.  Nope.  Nah, he'll scare me.  He doesn't know you.  Why don't you tell him who you are?  I can't believe you get in the elevator with that motherfucker. 
[02:17:00]  No, I just see him walking.  Yeah?  Do you ever give him the old head tip where you go, hey, you like me, Cuckoo?  I just say hello, Dr. Cuckoo.  He's shy.  And what does he say?  What's that?  He's a shy Asian man.  That's crazy.  He's had enough of me.  I'd love to put on Fox News for you, but the epic conglomerate that is Time Warner just  doesn't want to work today, so you get no Fox News.  Well, how come we can only get MSNBC?  We were this close to getting a snow day, and you had to fix everything.  Well, you think I don't want to go home? 
[02:17:30]  I had a car accident this morning.  Why don't you want to go home?  Oh, why is that work then?  Were you driving 70 miles in a Honda, you pinhead?  No, I was doing 40 in a Mercury.  Pinhead.  So the guy driving in the Mercury, vomiting out the driver's side window.  To the bump head.  He'll be wearing a red hat.  We went over this before, but I want to make perfectly clear.  Perfectly clear.  There was a TV there, right?  Yeah, as a plug.  No, no, we've been through this before.  I know we've been through this. 
[02:18:00]  No.  But I'm not accepting that there was never a TV there.  There wasn't.  Someone took a fucking last screen.  It's a figment of our imagination.  Are you sure?  I assume somebody stole it.  This used to be balanced.  There used to be three up there.  I think I said that, and I was proven wrong.  Like Adam said, there's a plug there.  Perfect.  That's a plug where a plug screen should be in front of them.  A plug does not a TV make.  I know.  Dude, I'd take stuff, too, man.  Especially in between the merger thing when things are still...  Yeah, when no one was really keeping an eye out.  Right, right. 
[02:18:30]  No one really knew what was around.  There was never a TV there, huh?  No, from what I've been told by Mars when he was in, because he probably stole it.  We did cover this, too, because we all thought there was a TV there at one point.  Yes, we did.  No, we do.  We also did a TV, because it looks like there should be a TV there.  And it should be S7, according to the numbers.  S7?  S5?  S5.  S5.  T1, T2.  This is TV, T2. 
[02:19:00]  That's an S7 that's missing.  What?  Let's take...  We could take one.  No one's going to know.  No one would.  Two, four, six, eight, oh, we have...  We have 12 flat screens in this place.  Can't get Fox on any of them.  Well, don't forget about the audience monitor, also.  The what?  The one for the audience.  Oh, yeah, they get one out there, too.  All this is going away, because they feel like we need to broadcast from a really small studio.  Yes.  Because it's closer to them.  Yeah.  They need us in their sights, and they need us in a very small studio. 
[02:19:30]  Why?  Because it's better for the show, Adam.  What are you, stupid?  Yeah, you're right.  Why are you asking questions?  How dare me, man?  Are they closing this facility totally?  I don't know.  No live audience anymore.  Because they're blowing it up, yes.  We can't do live audience stuff?  Nope.  They said no.  How could we?  It depends.  I mean, I don't know about live audience stuff, but I know that if we need a bigger space,  bigger space can be made available with a day's notice.  So interpret that as you will.  That's closer.  To get a live audience up through security in that building and in the elevators and through 
[02:20:00]  the serious lobby area, which is like, just not, they do not want, and believe me, I know  the reasons, too.  They don't want fans walking around.  Yeah.  Because it's, you know, a...  Offices and stuff up there, right?  No.  No.  Because...  Because there's other shows that perhaps don't get along as well with our show.  It's, you know, a Howard thing.  Oh.  They don't want... 
[02:20:30]  Who wants fucking O&A fans trotting through the studios when, you know, there's that going  on.  But we're getting along now.  Jimmy's doing a game at all.  No, no, I know that.  I'm just saying...  We're all getting along, right?  They work on a delay.  We're getting along this week.  I don't know what, you know, what the future brings, but...  It's like right before the holidays.  Look, we don't have any trouble.  Grandma's coming.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, great.  Look, we're second-class citizens.  They try to make believe we're not, but trust me, we are. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  We'll continue onwards.  We are.  But that's what happens.  We have an amazing facility they're taking away from us and throwing us in a little box.  Oh, they're...  Cost-cutting.  They're throwing blueprints in front of us and making it sound like they're doing something  nice for us, but the reality is it's a small little fuckhole that we've got to broadcast  from.  And what's going on with this place?  They're making the fuckhole nicer for us.  Oh, that's wonderful.  It's going to be a nice fuckhole.  What, are they greasing it up so it doesn't hurt as much?  Thank you.  A few bells and whistles.  This place is going to turn into a kiddie porn studio.  They might as well. 
[02:21:30]  It's set up nice.  Yeah.  For little cameras.  For cameras.  Play space.  Will we have any TVs in our new studio?  Not.  Two.  We will have two televisions is what I saw on the blueprint.  Maybe a few more.  Maybe.  Smaller versions.  Perhaps more than that.  Is it as big as our old fucking space used to be here?  It's about the size of when the wall was up.  Across.  Yeah.  So we're just going back to where we were before.  Yeah, exactly.  We're going right back to where we were.  We have to be good boys because, you know, that's what you do nowadays. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  Well, you've got to be good because the economy's bad.  Yeah.  So they've got an excuse.  Everyone has an excuse.  Right.  Because they could go, well, the economy's bad.  Right.  Hey, this guy needs some cash.  Now the economy's bad.  This guy needs this.  Now the economy's bad.  The TVs are breaking.  Everything's breaking.  Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.  It's just the way it goes.  We're in a, um, uh, recession bordering on depression.  Mm-hmm.  Is what they say. 
[02:22:30]  All right.  Moving on.  Everything's fixed.  Everything's fixed.  Good.  We're in good shape.  What the hell?  What the?  We were then going to do the, uh, then what happened there?  Dr. Doom.  Look, buddy.  Oh, yeah.  That guy.  John Montone.  I'm John Montone, and you're a fuck.  And you cut me off, dickweed.  His name should be John Monotone.  Uh, yeah.  It is odd that his last name kind of sounds like his delivery. 
[02:23:00]  Mm-hmm.  Kind of monotone.  Meh.  Hey.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to take a quick break.  What?  Well, now that we've got the equipment working.  What?  What?  What happened?  Hang on a sec.  Oh.  Before break?  Yeah, stall for a few seconds.  Danny's got something.  Stretch.  Stretch.  Why do we have to start?  All right.  I'm good at that.  I've got to check the live read schedule.  You've got to check the live read schedule.  I'm good at that.  Let's stretch.  All right.  Something funny.  Right?  Yeah?  Yeah?  All right. 
[02:23:30]  Why don't we start with Jim?  Yeah, thank you.  He's cracking.  He got it.  He's cracking up.  He got it.  He got it.  Right?  Right?  Yeah?  Yeah?  I love when he points at the monkey on the fucking Colt Rack.  It kind of laughs me around here.  But you know what was even better is that in the first episode when they first show you  that monkey, he doesn't even say anything.  He just points at it.  He points at it.  He just points at it and just makes that, huh?  Look, we got a monkey.  It's like, yeah, he just points at it.  Watched, yeah, The Office, the original English Office last night and was just, I'm sitting 
[02:24:00]  there alone, just laughing my ass off and I had to text Jimmy.  I was just like, this is the funniest shit ever put to film.  And it made me want to go home and watch it.  So I'm wide awake last night at 1.30.  I throw on the fucking, no, it was actually other than that.  It was a 12.30.  I throw on the, uh, training episode.  It's so fucking good, that one.  There's been a rape.  There's been a rape.  You're supposed to be the guy complaining.  Go ahead.  There's been a rape up there.  And the way he delivers that line is perfect. 
[02:24:30]  He was frustrated that he couldn't win.  And the other guy is just going, he goes, I don't care.  It's not my shift.  Well, I don't care.  You know, I'm on break.  And then he just interrupts so perfectly.  He just goes, I think there's been a rape up there.  It just stops the whole thing.  Everyone is just floored.  Just like, what?  And then he goes, well, you know, I rattled you.  I should be the one to play the manager.  And the guy's like, uh, I have a problem with my room.  I don't care.  What room is it?  Room 306.  There is no room 306. 
[02:25:00]  There is no room 306.  See, sometimes they'll be lying.  Sometimes the complaints will be false.  The complaints, yeah, will be false.  You see?  Yeah?  And the other guy's looking at him like, what the fuck am I doing here?  Fantastic, hysterical show.  Gervais is a goddamn genius.  The funniest guy.  It's every single move, every little twitch of his tie and when he's like, he scratches  his head.  Anything he does is perfect. 
[02:25:30]  And how they got a collection of people that can look so uncomfortable and make it look  so natural.  The eyes darting, the whole eye darting movement thing that they do.  It's unbelievable.  Every move was scripted, too.  Like it was, they really went very carefully.  It looks like it should be a lot of ad-lib going on, but no.  Finchie is the best.  His fucking, he idolizes Finchie.  Oh.  Who's not funny.  He's an asshole.  Finchie's a dude.  Finchie stinks. 
[02:26:00]  But he just does like, like the just fucking grunting, humping motions.  And Gervais will just be laughing his ass off at everything Finchie does.  Him and Gareth just think Finchie is the bee's knees.  Finchie fucking blows.  The very end of the first British office episode, you know, when Tim is putting his  stapler in the jelly.  The jelly.  What I didn't realize until maybe, I guess, probably second season, I didn't realize  there's a little maybe three-second scene during the credits, which I never noticed 
[02:26:30]  before.  At the end, yeah.  At the end.  So I went back to the first episode last night, and I noticed that that scene is Gareth  walking in, and more of his shit is in the jetpack.  And he's bringing it into Dave's office.  He doesn't trust jelly.  That's the way it moves.  Well, why does he do that?  Well, I told him once that I don't like jelly.  Great.  I got to watch the Christmas episode.  I guess it's the last one.  You have to.  If you didn't see those, it's two episodes. 
[02:27:00]  And if you didn't see them, you missed it.  I'm definitely popping out.  It's more than an hour, though.  Yeah, well, yeah, I think the first one's like 40-something minutes, and the next one's  like 50-something minutes, so it's a watch.  Yeah, that I'm definitely checking out once I get home.  Oh, it's 90 minutes.  Okay, cool.  We got a stupid meeting?  What do we got?  Stupid meeting today?  Blueprint meeting.  Oh, blueprint meeting?  We're really happy about what they're doing for us.  You know, those meetings.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, thanks.  I like the way they drew people.  Oh, wow.  I want to sit like you. 
[02:27:30]  You know, I was thinking that yesterday, and I wanted to say something, but I couldn't  think anything funny.  I know.  I was just like, you know what?  I'm just going to leave it a lot.  I'll just leave it with blueprint drawing of people.  It's blueprint drawings of people.  We just sit, apparently, straight up, spine straight, with your arms straight out on the  console.  We all look like Christopher Reeve.  Yeah, yeah.  This will be a joke for two people.  You all look like echo chrome people.  For the six people that know that game.  Thank you.  By the way, we can take that break now if you want.  No, no, no. 
[02:28:00]  Let's continue that.  I know echo chrome.  No, you don't.  I do.  No, you don't.  No, you don't.  It's smiling.  It's cracking up.  It's cracking up.  He gets it.  He gets it.  He got it.  The bottom line, did you ever watch The British Office?  No.  It's a fucking work of art.  Even the moment you don't laugh at, you just acknowledge how great they were.  It was such a believable portrayal of just a boob.  A complete ass who just wanted to be liked.  And he wants to be funny so badly.  And he's so not. 
[02:28:30]  Like, just not even not funny.  So the opposite of funny.  And he's a sexual prude.  It's a weird little thing.  Like, he doesn't like sexual perversion.  He's a weird guy when it comes to women.  You know, like, he's always trying to make them equal.  And he looks at the porn site.  He goes, big breasts.  Something about punishing girls with big breasts.  They should punish.  I think it's Danish girls.  And Gary's like, they should be rewarded.  If anything.  He's like, well, they shouldn't be rewarded or punished. 
[02:29:00]  What a ghoul.  He goes, no.  He goes, they should be equal.  They should be equal.  He's so sincere when he looks at the camera, too.  And when they leave that camera on him a little too long, and he's just like, his eyes start darting around.  But he's smiling.  Because you can almost feel his flop sweat.  Yes.  Like, what is happening.  Like, he's trying to play it off so hard that, like, you know, I know what I'm doing.  But inside, you know, he's like, I hope they don't.  And they leave the camera on long enough for you to see that.  Plus, he's incredibly racist. 
[02:29:30]  But he does it in a way where he thinks that he's not.  Yeah.  Where he goes up to a Pakistani guy, and he's like, oh, do that Ali G impression.  You know.  And he's like, I don't know what you're talking about.  He's like, yeah, come on, you do.  He's like, no, I think you're thinking of the other.  He goes, oh, I guess I'm thinking of the other.  I'm thinking of the other one.  And then the guy goes, you know, the packy?  And he goes, oh, that's incredibly racist.  Incredibly racist.  He looks at the camera like disgusted.  Like, oh, that's terrible.  Do you watch the American version?  I don't see the American version either.  The Jervais one I like is Extras. 
[02:30:00]  Great show.  Extras is all right.  That's funny.  Yeah, you got to get through a couple of the first episodes, which were a little like.  Of Extras?  Yeah.  I love the first one, though, where the girl's fucking brothers are retard.  Yeah, that's funny.  That's funny.  Yeah, the first couple were like, uh-oh.  Then you get into it, and then the second season's a lot better.  When David Bowie sings the song to him in the bar.  What was the song, Fat Man?  Sad Little Fat Man.  Sad Little Fat Man.  But it's David Bowie, and everyone's gathering around like it's a Christmas special. 
[02:30:30]  And it's very great because he goes back to that little bar just to fucking have those  local yokels praise him.  Yeah.  That was great.  Yeah.  That was great.  He's such a sad little man.  That was great.  When he's trying to show off for the new employee, and Dawn goes, you're a sad little man.  And he goes, oh, am I?  Like, he's so embarrassed that his fucking little joke flopped, made her cry.  Oh, my God.  That was so bad.  He told her she was fired. 
[02:31:00]  She's fired.  For taking post-it notes.  And then she goes, what would I do with post-it notes?  And he goes, I don't know, make the little things on the end of joints.  Roaches?  Yeah, that's it.  And then she just starts crying.  He goes, that's a joke.  Put you on.  Put you on.  He goes, how much are post-it notes?  12p?  And he goes, well, he's like, yeah, but then you steal 100 of them, and you've made a profit.  Let's say hi to Kyle on Long Island.  Kyle.  Yeah, guys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Welcome aboard, Kyle.  Well, here's the deal. 
[02:31:30]  I was obsessed with the British office.  I refused to watch the American version, because I didn't think anyone could compete with Gervais.  But you guys need to give it a shot.  Steve Carell is a comedic genius.  A lot of the first scripts are copies, almost direct copies of the British ones.  Right.  It is, the first, like, three seasons are just as good.  It's not, I mean, it's blasphemous, but it's not better than the British ones.  I do like the American office as well.  I absolutely don't think it's better.  It's a different show.  It's a different show. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, the English office is amazing.  Yeah.  I'll agree with this guy.  The first three seasons of the American office, I thought, were very well written, and I thought  they were, you know, they were good episodes.  And then I started to notice fourth season, things started to get just a little wacky.  Well, because it's one of those shows.  Because they didn't have the material.  Yeah, because it's one of those shows, you shouldn't, like, you know, have too many  seasons.  That's how it's set up.  Yeah.  Like, Michael Scott is supposed to be, you know, like, the Gervais character, where he's  trying to be funny, but he's not, and he's just this awkward, cringy guy.  But now, like, Carell's Michael Scott almost seems like he's a little retarded. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, yeah.  You know?  You can't change the character like that.  I know exactly what you mean.  Yeah, like, he's still kind of, he's still the bumbling fool, but now he's so much so  that it's almost a parody of his original character.  You know who they did that to in one of the greatest shows ever made, All in the Family?  They did it to Edith.  Edith.  Edith, in season one, if you listen to her, she kind of snaps back at Archie every so  often.  Her voice was a lot lower. 
[02:33:00]  She was still nasal and everything, but her voice was lower.  It sounded more natural, and she was just kind of a dopey housewife, and then they decided  to make her retarded.  Completely fucking retarded.  Yeah.  She's just, I'll get you, Pete.  And it wasn't as funny as when she was just kind of the dopey housewife that was a little  more realistic.  Let's snap back a little bit.  Yeah.  Every character, even Archie, toward the end, they milked the shit out of that series until  it just sucked.  Yeah.  Archie Bunker's Place, and all that crap, and they just wrecked it. 
[02:33:30]  They became parodies of themselves.  Yeah.  It happens with so many shows.  They, like, the people latch on to a character, and then I guess they decide they have to kind  of change it or grow as a character or just keep people interested by fucking it up.  Well, everybody left.  Edith left.  Oh, yeah, I know.  Yeah, it was just Archie on the phone with everyone.  Hey, how you doing there, Meathead on the phone there?  It's like, everyone's got to be on the phone. 
[02:34:00]  Jack Tripper there.  Hey, Chrissy.  Why did he take that shit?  Yeah, she's on the phone.  She's calling.  You want to take the money?  Just call him.  Throw a whole bunch of money at him.  Because that was an amazing fucking show.  That end with him on the phone.  Oh, just horrible.  Yeah.  They did that with so many shows, though.  You take cream and sugar in your eye.  In your eye.  In your eye.  In your eye.  You take cream and sugar in your eye.  Perfect.  Let's take a quick break.  We can continue with this.  I know you couldn't help being a spade, but what made you go Jew? 
[02:34:30]  Did you say that?  Yeah.  The Sammy Davis Jr.  Yeah.  Fucking, I asked Kenny, here's what I wanted.  I'm trying to do it.  A nice, a protein drink with, uh...  Uh-oh.  Oh, guys, careful.  Easy.  With, uh, skim milk and some chocolate powder.  That's all I want.  But there's ice in it and it's chopped up, so it's like an awful slushie.  Oh, it's not like a smoothie.  No.  It's a roughie.  It's like a shitty.  It's a shitty.  It's a shitty?  Okay.  Shitty. 
[02:35:00]  It's like a smoothie made at home and the ice didn't break all the time.  I used to hate when mudslides were made and people didn't leave it in the blender long enough.  You're like cracking ice in your teeth.  Fuck that.  It should be like a Slurpee because you have fucked up.  That's usually like the fourth blender you make.  Yeah, you just want it quick.  You just can't wait.  I can't fucking wait.  I'm just, the whole ice cubes are in your mouth.  I can fucking bust them apart with my mullet.  Go fuck yourself.  Just pour it in my mouth.  I'll shake it around.  Yeah, good mudslide should be like a smoothie.  Let's break. 
[02:35:30]  Break!  So what becomes of you, my love?  When may I find this script you are?  The handbags and the glass racks that your granddad has to sweat so you could buy.  O.B. and Anthony, Sirius 197, XM202, the virus. 
[02:36:00]  Yes.  Oh, yes, yes.  I love when I, I love when I pop right in.  When the mic just pops down and I'm talking, it goes, ah, yeah.  Adam, listen to this one.  You're going to love this one.  All right.  You're, you're engaged.  You're going to love this one.  What is it?  You, um, unhappily married out there, but you can't afford that divorce. 
[02:36:30]  Right.  Divorce, very expensive.  Uh, the thought of spending thousands of dollars on legal fees, selling the house, it's taking  a huge loss.  Why do it?  Buy a Walter PPK.  No, no, not that extent.  I would love if they came on as a sponsor, but this is different.  Uh, AshleyMadison.com wants you to know you're, you're not alone.  Breaking up, hard to do, as they say, but, uh, it's also expensive.  That's why thousands of people are turning to AshleyMadison.com every day to have a discreet

Yes, I do.  I have been to the Ashley Madison site. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, God.  So I believe it.  It's secure.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, they're looking...  If you're looking for fulfillment outside your marriage, let's say your wife is all right.  Mm-hmm.  She takes care of the kids.  Mm-hmm.  She does the cleaning.  She cooks.  Does all that.  But the bedroom?  Fucking dud.  Nothing.  Dud.  What is a man to do?  What are you going to do?  You're going to cash in the good part...  Right.  ...for the one part you're missing.  No.  You go to AshleyMadison.com.  Now, you're getting some from another... 
[02:38:30]  From a chick that is in the same boat.  Maybe the husband's a great provider.  Right.  He's good with the kids.  He's this.  But, you know, maybe he's a little short in that area.  Okay.  Maybe he, uh, comes too quick.  There's plenty of examples of why...  Sure.  ...maybe she doesn't want to have sex with him.  You two meet on AshleyMadison.com.  Now, you're fucking.  Okay.  You're having a good time with each other.  You're, uh, you're out and about.  If it works out.  And it works out because you're both in the same boat.  You don't want, uh, you're not just picking up some whore at a bar. 
[02:39:00]  Right.  Did he turn yet?  This is picking up a whore on the internet.  No, it's not a whore.  It's someone in your situation.  I'm not going to be ignored, Dad.  It's not your...  It's exactly like the situation you would be in.  You know, the miserable husband, the miserable wife.  Now they get together and they're happy.  Because that's what I want to do.  I want to go on the internet and find someone else's miserable wife to hang around with.  No, but she's only miserable because...  Here's the rub.  Oh.  She's only miserable...  The rub should be in your lap.  Mr. Hamlet? 
[02:39:30]  It should be because she's only miserable because she's in that lousy marriage, sexless marriage.  She might dig the guy, uh, the rest of the time.  But then, now you're giving it to each other.  Now you're going home and going, I'm getting my sex.  Right.  I'm having this discreet affair with AshleyMadison.com.  Thanks to them.  And I get the rent paid, the mortgage paid, the car payment, the kids are taken care of.  I don't have to worry about divorce lawyers and everything like that.  Yet.  Not yet.  Okay.  Why is she or you going to say anything? 
[02:40:00]  The credit card bills go, AshleyMadison.com.  Do you think it's secure and anonymous?  Honey, what is this?  Do you think it's going to be dumb enough to have a credit card that comes back and says,  oh, for screwing other women?  No, it's discreet.  Ashley, what's it going to say?  Crabtree and Evelyn?  It's discreet.  Uh-huh.  And 100% secure.  Three million members right there.  Okay.  Number one dating service for married people.  AshleyMadison.com.  It's just so morally wrong.  It is not morally wrong. 
[02:40:30]  You're making moral assumptions based on your own opinions.  Yeah.  I think this is fantastic.  Okay.  Thank you, Herb Tarlick.  What else are you selling?  Did he turn you at him?  No.  Not at all, huh?  Look.  People are using the service.  Perhaps.  Well, you know something?  You're talking to a guy that's just been engaged.  Of course.  You're talking to a newlywed.  Right.  Of course these guys aren't going to understand.  I was in a horrid, loveless marriage.  I understand what Ashley Madison's all about. 
[02:41:00]  But you did what you do.  You got divorced.  What are you going to do?  I went to Fisher Price.  I know.  But go to Ashley Madison.  That's brilliant.  AshleyMadison.com.

[02:45:00]  I'm actually going to get some for my girl.  I'm a terrible boyfriend.  Pro flower stuff.  I'm full of it.  Is it a girl or a girlfriend?  Well, it's hard to say.  I mean, what do we know?  We're not really banging other people.  She's not banging other people.  That's kind of a girlfriend, my friend.  How long has it been?  About four days.  No, I don't know.  A little, not long, actually.  Very recent.  Very recent.  Yeah, so get her flowers.  Yeah. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, what else am I going to get her?  I'm not going to get her anything else.  Here, here's a Mets hat.  She's banging.  Going to do that?  Dude, my legs are sore.  I got a workout.  I got a workout.  Banging her.  Yeah.  All I can do is give her flowers.  Sorry.  All that effort, and you didn't get to go over the edge.  Pro flowers, put that on the card.

[02:46:00]  Brought you as close as I could.  Yes.  Sorry, it was bent like a shrimp tail.  Sorry.  Sorry, it wasn't as turgid as I had promised.  Turgid.  Turgid.  Yes.  Sorry.  My hog would have looked great if it was being filmed in a hurricane.  It looked like a report of, in a really bad hurricane,  it was just kind of bent over and silly.  I was so sad.  It's like Pacino passed out on his lips.  I wish there was a wig on here instead of a little teeny helmet. 
[02:46:30]  Pro flowers.  Proflowers.com.  Yes.  We're in the middle of spots, so we should probably let them continue,  and then we'll be back.  It's a six-hour read.  No kidding.  We've been doing reads for the last ten minutes.  What's wrong with us?  Why not?  Why not, indeed?  Proflowers.com.  Proflowers.com.  Proflowers.com.  Proflowers.com.  There, we're back to this.  All right, enough of this music.  Well, we do have the rape scene for everybody.  That was referenced a few minutes ago, maybe an hour ago at this point. 
[02:47:00]  The English Office with Ricky Gervais.  He's a fan of the radio show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He blogs about us every once in a while.  Or maybe he blogged about us once, and we make believe it was more than what it was.  I know.  Hey, it walks as good as a hit.  You're on base.  All right.  Fantastic.  We have to explain what this is.  It's training day at the office.  There's a guy in, and he's training all these people, like little just office bullshit, teamwork,  and they're all in this conference room.  And Ricky is just competing with him for attention as the office manager. 
[02:47:30]  He cannot let this outside guy come in and get the attention.  And it's just great how he's just competing to be the top dog.  He does that with every outside guy that comes in to try to do anything with his staff and  steal his thunder.  Yeah.  It's a little more than just training.  It's training for customer care.  Yes.  So that's like the main idea here, is that how to deal with, like, with potentially.  Right, about care for a customer.  Yeah.  Like that kind of.  Like Danny would explain it, and then I would jump in like it was my explanation. 
[02:48:00]  Is that what you said?  Maybe I spaced out.  No, no.  You said it.  I just kind of jumped in on top of you and just stole what you were saying.  That's exactly what he does on the show.  I'm doing exactly, I'm doing exactly what.  It's a dance.  See, see how it goes exactly, exactly like that.  That's, that's it, right?  Yeah, right.  Right, right?  Piece it together.  Yes.  Okay, well, you've got a complaint.  You've come and complained, and I'll show you the wrong way to handle it.  This will be the wrong way.  Okay.  Right, so, off we go. 
[02:48:30]  Sorry, what's the complaint?  You know, just, just make it up.  Anything.  Because there's no right or wrong thing in this scenario.  Anyway, then we tell you the right thing afterwards, so, we might as well.  You've got a complaint.  Yeah.  Right.  Okay.  Okay.  I'd like to make a complaint, please.  Don't care.  Well, um, I am staying in the hotel.  I don't care, it's not my shift.  Well, you're an ambassador for the hotel.  I don't care.  I don't care what you're saying.  I think you'll care when I'm telling you what the complaint is.  I think there's been a rape up there! 
[02:49:00]  I've got his attention.  Get their attention.  Okay?  Um, right, so, well, some, some interesting points.  Very interesting points.  Fights up there.  It's not, not, not quite the point I was trying to make, but.  Different points to be made.  So am I.  That's great.  Not quite the point.  Different points to be made.  Like, every fucked up thing he does that the guy's pointing out that he's fucking up,  he turns around and it's like, I'm teaching these, my, my subordinates.  He's the fucking best at covering up with bullshit that we've all used. 
[02:49:30]  It's like, that was so well written.  Oh, fantastic.  Like, uh, get their attention.  Like, like, that was the lesson.  It was so great.  And meanwhile, everyone's looking like, oh my God, what the fuck did you just say?  That is not in the realm of what should be said during this, uh, a training.  But, he turns around, get their attention.  I think there's been a rape up there.  You're right, that is perfectly delivered.  And he points up, the way he pointed, like, yeah, it's upstairs, you know, there's the rape. 
[02:50:00]  His delivery is so good in that line that I've driven, like, places, just repeating that over and over again.  Like, just trying to get it just how he does it.  It is really perfect the way he says it.  Just stops.  The rape up there.  I wish we had the rebuttal when Ricky takes over and becomes the fucking, uh, in the role play, becomes the hotel manager.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And the guy tries to phase him.  We can get that, sure.  Yeah, we can get it for you.  Fucking hysterical. 
[02:50:30]  I, I, and we obviously had Ricky Gervais on the show and discussed this, but for some reason, we've all decided to watch the show again.  Like, we've all out of nowhere just decided to pop it in and watch the, uh, watch the show again.  So we're all kind of on the same page.  You've got to get a copy, Adam.  Yeah.  You got to check it out.  Who's cool as Ricky Cole?  You got the, he is great.  Yeah.  He's too fucking cool for how goddamn funny he is.  You know?  Yeah, absolutely.  Right?  Yeah?  Yeah?  Yeah?  The, uh, you, you got the Netflix through your fucking Xbox or anything like that? 
[02:51:00]  No.  Dude, it's the shit.  Yeah, Xbox.  You play video games?  Got the Xbox?  No, I don't got the PlayStation 3.  This is the shit.  What's the last video game you played?  Language!  Language.  Netflix.  The video game I played was probably, uh, Breakout on Atari.  Oh my God.  Yars Revenge.  Wow.  Yeah.  Oof.  Danny turned me on to that fucking crack.  What is it?  When he said, he goes, yeah, dude, you get Netflix.  So you get back on Xbox.  I'm like, what?  I was reading about it for months.  I'm like, that sounds really cool. 
[02:51:30]  And I, like, as the, as it was like coming to the release date, I was more and more excited.  And like, I was really, I thought for a moment I had gotten my hopes up, but then I downloaded  it and I've been using it every day since.  Yeah, it rules.  You just, every fucking day you use it for TV shows, everything.  You miss the show, you miss the season, you do, boom, it's right there.  It's what, a monthly fee?  Yeah, it's, so it's not like you're.  What about PS3?  Can you do it on there?  No, and they have no plans.  Why?  Because Sony, Sony really just dropped the ball at the PS3.  Wow.  I don't know.  Sony fucking stinks.  If I'm going to get a video system, Xbox is the one to get. 
[02:52:00]  You can't do that.  I got to switch out my PlayStation 3.  I just found out.  I would have to say Xbox, do you see?  I'm an Xbox guy.  Xbox guy?  Yeah.  The control looks weird when you're used to it.  Does it?  PlayStation, yeah.  You get used to it really quickly, actually.  And now the PlayStation one feels good.  It looks so like, I don't even know which way is up when I hold those things.  No, the last video game I played was at the apartment, that sub game you had.  Holy shit.  What's wrong with you, Adam?  Wow, that is going back.  Wait, the sub game where you'd strap on a dildo and fuck Ant's bottom?  In the tub. 
[02:52:30]  Sub game where you'd come on the floor and make him clean up the mess?  In the tub.  Torpedo away.  That's it.  You know it's...  I'm going to send one across your balcony, man.  Clean it up, cuck boy.  You know it's okay to play video games as an adult, right?  Yeah, I just...  It's the new thing, man.  You're allowed to do it, man.  You're not nerdy.  And you don't like the Wii?  I like the Wii.  You like the Wii?  Yeah.  The Wii's fun.  Yeah?  I am not a Wii guy.  No, no.  I see it as an infantile, childish kind of a game. 
[02:53:00]  Bling-ding, bling-ding.  I want to aim for the cube.  I want to break E-Rock's knuckles.  I need a little more tradition in my games.  I need the blood, guts, and shit like that.  Well, they're going that way with the Wii Fit.  I mean, not the Wii Fit, but the Wii.  What the fuck?  You're coughing up blood?  Get off the treadmill?  They'll go that direction with the Wii.  Right now, it's all nice and happy and family-oriented, but they'll get into some shit with the Wii,  I'm thinking.  I'm just so scared shitless now of the Red Ring of Death. 
[02:53:30]  What's the word?  And I'm knocking wood.  What?  And I'm not even going to say.  Xbox has something called the Red Ring of Death.  There's a green ring when you start your console up.  Oh, no.  And then you're hunky-dory, as they say.  You're playing games.  You're watching fucking movies.  You're enjoying your Xbox.  Then there's something when you turn on.  A red ring of death.  And it just means, pretty much, you now have a doorstop, and you need to get a new Xbox. 
[02:54:00]  That's easy.  You can send it back to Microsoft and get a refurbished Red Ring of Death fucking thing.  Who cares?  You're not losing anything.  You just got to get a new freaking Xbox.  But it's inconvenient.  But you know what, Ant?  You probably won't run into that problem because you got yours a little later in the game.  I did, yes.  So you got the updated boards with the newer chipsets and everything.  I can totally expect a Red Ring of Death when I get home, man.  Dude, I'm on my third one. 
[02:54:30]  I bought my first one.  It died.  I sent it back to get me a new one.  That one died.  Sent that one back.  And now I'm on my third one.  If this one goes, I'm just buying a new one.  Yeah, brand new.  How much are you playing?  That's the thing.  No, that's the thing.  Not even.  I mean, I know people that play.  Obviously not Guitar Hero.  Sorry, Dan.  Oh, Dan.  Sorry.  Actually, if Derek is here.  If, if, if you had a square asshole, you'd shit break.  Remember Q&A?  If, if, I don't want to hear that shit. 
[02:55:00]  I think he's currently dealing with his Red Ring of Death.  Oh, he is.  Yeah, I think everybody on staff has had it except for Travis.  Where does it show up?  Right on the front.  Right on the front.  It's a green ring that shows that you have the power on and stuff.  There's Derek.  Dealing with the Red Ring of Death.  Yeah, I actually burnt my hat, I think, two weeks ago.  That's what it looks like.  Oh, that's it.  Holy shit.  That's it.  That's it.  Hey, Tim, when did you fucking, uh, when did you get your Red Ring? 
[02:55:30]  Are you going to ask out Dawn or are you going to fix your Xbox?  Holy shit, it's Tim.  It's fucking.  Stop putting Gareth's stapler in the jelly.  Sorry.  Okay.  So what happened?  No, I think I burnt it out playing Fallout 3.  I was playing it for like eight hours one night.  You can't burn it out by playing too much or anything.  I think you can.  I really don't.  One of the, uh, one of the, uh, uh, theories behind why they fail so often, 
[02:56:00]  because, like, the first wave of Xboxes, there's something like an 80% failure rate.  Oh, fuck.  It's disgusting.  But what they say is there's weak, there's weak solder points.  So the more you play, the inside heats up a little bit.  It heats up and melts the solder.  There's not a proper heat sink, so then the solder melts, and now there's broken connections.  That's why it happened to my rear window defrost during my fucking Escalade.  That's why there's a, uh, plug soldered.  If you, if you Google, there's something called the Xbox 360 towel trick.  And what this is, is you wrap your, your broken Xbox in a towel.  No.  And, and turn it on, leave it running so that the heat cannot escape. 
[02:56:30]  And the heat builds up inside the console, re-melt the solder, and reconnects it.  And starts a fire.  Yeah.  And then your fucking couch is burning.  The red house of death.  Oh, exactly.  Red ring of death, you have it on your ass.  It works.  Danny is, uh, being backed up with, uh, Matt here.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Happy birthday, James.  Thank you, Matty.  Welcome aboard.  That towel thing works?  It sure does.  I had the red ring of death, and I looked it up on YouTube. 
[02:57:00]  And, uh, I wrapped it in, like, three towels.  They say you turn it on, leave it for half an hour, and it, it, uh, the red ring of death  didn't come back for, like, three months.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, it's not exactly a permanent solution.  The red ring of death?  Why do they call that such a harsh name?  Well, people don't like it.  Look at it.  No.  Jim had just shown a picture of it.  I think, you know what it is?  I think it's just playing off, uh, because it's a Microsoft product, so they're playing  off the blue screen of death.  I'm frightened.  The red ring of death.  Uh, please show me that again.  PlayStation 3 people call, and you can get movies through, uh, PlayStation 3. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, but not, not in that sense.  You can, you can buy, like, if you wanted to download, like, Transformers or something  on your PlayStation, you can do that, but you can't just have a monthly access fee for  one price and then download and watch as much as you want.  There's no service like that.  Say I want to watch, uh, Best of Shia LeBeau.  I often do.  You can go to a PlayStation store.  Where would I get that?  A PlayStation store, James.  Oh, all right.  But they don't have a Netflix type of service.  Netflix sounds great.  That thing, and they just had a great fucking quarter, too. 
[02:58:00]  I was thinking about, I was like, fuck, why didn't I buy it?  Yeah, because, uh, people, they're broke.  They're staying home.  A lot of people are getting this service.  And it's cheap.  I mean, all of this is cheap.  Because you're not really paying for, for the, the streaming service.  You're paying for the, like, the get one disc in the mail, two discs in the mail, and  that service just happens to come free.  So you get the one disc, which you don't ever, which I never even use.  No.  And it's like, it's like $9 a month.  That's a fucking rip off.  And you're getting every, and you're getting like, you could just fucking, 20 movies. 
[02:58:30]  No late fees, because you're not fucking, you know, you don't have a real product or  anything.  You've got to think cable's doing real well right now, too.  People are adding to their cable packages.  They're adding, you think?  Sports baby, maybe.  Yeah, adding, because instead of going out, they're like, you know, we've got to stay in  a little more than we're used to.  So let's add a channel or two.  You think they're cut back?  Yeah.  I think they're cut back, but watch, you know.  You have your favorites.  There are channels, I have to go through the entire 200s on my fucking TV, because it's 
[02:59:00]  all Spanish.  It's all fucking Spanish, and it's there, and it's like from 200 to 299.  I wonder if you'd get rid of that with parental controls.  Like, if you just set all the channels to block, we'd probably just skip right over the  channels.  That'd be fucking mint.  That's a smart idea.  Because it pisses me off.  I'm going through them.  I'm like, what's on, what's on?  I think it's favorites.  You just go on the favorites and put the loop on that you want to go through.  Yeah?  Oh, sure.  But then I've got to put so many of my favorites.  So many.  I do.  I put so many.  Because I like perusing all the channels, except for the Spanish ones, because I don't 
[02:59:30]  understand what the fuck they're saying.  But I like perusing.  Spanish TV's always the same thing.  It's like an old guy with a bad toupee, hot girls, a donkey, and a confetti force.  And they're making sounds.  And then some bitch comes out with big tits.  Yeah.  It looks like old Technicolor.  Every fucking set that they have looks like it came from The Wizard of Oz when she came out  of the house and everything was in color.  Man.  And all of a sudden it's a carnival.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll go back.  We got The Office Training Part 2. 
[03:00:00]  Is that...  Oh, this is Ricky becoming the boss in the role play?  Yeah, yeah.  He now wanted to switch it because apparently, you know, it didn't go so well the first time.  So now he's being the hotel guy.  And the new guy's being the guy that can play.  The training guy, yeah.  It's not quite the point I was trying to make.  Different points to be made.  I'm more to really in customer care.  So am I.  And the way that we would deal with somebody.  Maybe I should, as I thought, I should play the hotel manager because I'm used to that. 
[03:00:30]  I phased you.  But you have a go.  See if you can phase me.  Okay?  Yeah.  Right.  Okay.  Um, hello, uh, I wish to make a complaint.  I'm not interested.  Uh, my room is an absolute disgrace.  I don't care.  The bathroom doesn't appear to have been cleaned.  What room are you in?  362.  There is no 362 in this hotel.  Sometimes the complaints will be false.  Okay?  Good.  Okay?  Good.  Good.  Just derails everything. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  That's what, like, that's like what Louis was talking about yesterday.  In improv, when somebody just says something and it stops it dead.  Right.  It's exactly what he just did.  There is no room.  So, now what?  It just ruins what the guy's doing.  Yeah, what he's trying to do.  And the facial, like, it's such a visual show.  The facial expressions on everybody, you just constantly looking at him like, what the fuck  is this asshole doing?  When were you most embarrassed for him?  Oh.  Oh.  There was too many instances.  I think, though, it had to be the one where he did the motivational speaking. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, that's a real good one for embarrassment.  God, is that fantastic.  But I think probably maybe even a little more than that.  And you didn't see it, so I won't completely spoil it for you.  Oh, the Christmas?  But it's probably part one of the Christmas special when he's doing, like, the after stuff.  Well, I'll just say.  Possible.  I don't know.  When he dances after Neil.  Oh.  Neil and the girl do the classic.  Tell the girl do a perfect fucking Saturday Night Fever dance for the comic relief donations. 
[03:02:00]  And Gervais, he's just standing there pissed off and bummed out that they're doing such  a good job.  And they finish up and get, like, applause that don't, they don't stop.  They just keep going.  And he can't let them have the spotlight.  And then he steals it, and he's like, he really thinks he's good?  Yeah, he goes, oh, I do the dance.  And then everybody clap and kind of, all right, faster, faster.  And they're clapping and making, like, music.  And he's dancing to it. 
[03:02:30]  And then until there's, like, no one left clapping.  And he still goes on for so long doing this horrible dance.  He was hosting some Princess Diana tribute he was a part of a couple years ago in Wembley  Stadium.  And, you know, Princess Harry and Charles were there.  Harry and whatever, William.  And I guess the audience was screaming for him to do the dance.  Oh, really?  So he did the dance at Wembley Stadium.  Wow.  It was probably 80,000 people.  They went nuts.  Of course.  That's one of the best moments on the show. 
[03:03:00]  It's fucking...  It is such a bad dance.  He's swinging his arms around.  Yeah, dude, that's the best part.  But he's just doing, like, this marionette.  It's, like, swinging at his joints.  It's fucking terrible.  It's a fucking terrible dance.  Horrible.  Harry is up on the screen.  Oh, where is it?  For everybody in the room.  Are you in the volume or no?  Eh.  Damn.  You can't just be dancing.  And he can't even...  No, but him talking...  Let him have the spotlight. 
[03:03:30]  I know she moves.  Oh, go on.  Come on, you're a music.  I know she moves.  That's a beat.  What's up?  Well, I'll just be chatting.  A little bit.  A little bit.  He's such an asshole.  They're all getting uncomfortable.  Yeah.  And this is, like, after, like, a professional dance routine just went down. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They've all stopped clapping at this point.  Now they're just looking at him like he's completely fucking retarded.  How do you get a group of people to look that uncomfortable?  So, and that's right, babe.  Yeah.  What's that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bravo.  Bravo. 
[03:04:30]  Bravo.  Hehehehe.  Reserved applaud.  I'll give it more.  You might get a...  You don't have to give a donation for that, do you?  Well, don't say it like that.  All the money collected is for both dances.  Well, you know, if there is a difference.  Mine was impromptu.  So, but I don't think you should get extra points for that.  Necessarily.  Make your own minds up.  Leave me out of it.  I'm collecting for charity.  Right?  Charity.  Make your own minds up.  Make your own minds up.  Make your own minds up.  Make your own minds up.  Make your own minds up.  Leave me out of it.  I'm collecting for charity.  Right?  Charity.  Make your own minds up.  And then he picks up the bucket, full of the charity money that the other guy got  for doing the good dancing and walks away with it. 
[03:05:00]  For both dances.  For both dances.  For both dances.  Let's say hi to Mike.  Just a delusional asshole for Hoboken.  Mikey!  Yeah, there's actually a line where he, right before the dance, where he goes, if you want me dancing,  you should have come to me.  It's our sort of fused flash dance with MC Hammer shit.  Yeah, yeah!  MC Hammer shit!  Mike!  Mike!  He tries to speak in any type of a fucking relaxed, cool lingo. 
[03:05:30]  With MC Hammer shit!  Fucking Mike doing the good Ricky Gervais impression.  Yeah, that was a pretty good accident.  That was pretty good.  But he hung up.  Tim in Boston, how are you?  Hey guys, how you doing?  Good.  I just like the shit-eating grin on David Bryant's face.  After everything he does, like, he reinvented the wheel.  After that dance, it looks like they expect him to hand him an award or something.  Best dance ever.  Everything he does, yeah, to him, is the best thing ever.  And he's just awful at everything. 
[03:06:00]  I love that fucking show.  One more, we'll try to move on.  Rob in the Hamptons.  Rob!  Hey guys, we've seen where they're doing the evacuation drill.  You can't take a paralyzed person in a wheelchair down an elevator.  Oh, yeah!  They leave the guy there and Ricky explains, it's just a fire drill.  We'll be back for you.  It's a woman.  They carry her down the steps, but it's too many steps.  They leave her, like, four floors from the bottom, just on the landing, on the steps,  and they're like, we'll come back for you.  Oh, my God. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, that's right.  I think they show her later, about two minutes later, she's just sitting there and nobody's  coming for her.  Where's this ice storm thing?  Look at this.  It's just the Midwest.  That whole road is just fucked.  Yeah, just a nice little ice.  It's all icy.  Why are they not driving?  Because they know the second somebody rolls, they're not stopping until they roll into something.  Wow.  That's a whole fucking...  Oh, it's Texas.  Just a little...  Figures those fucking assholes can't drive on a little ice.  Yeah. 
[03:07:00]  It's like, go slow you hayseeds.  Wow, we don't know.  Yeah.  Well, we just yell giddy up and our cars slide around.  Spread some oil on it.  You could melt the ice with some propane.  Propane accessories.  Maybe you should take the horns off your Cadillac before we go driving.  We don't have any rock salt.  Do you want to sprinkle some Jews on the road?  Do we have any Negroes or Jews to make our driving smoother?  Any type of minority work? 
[03:07:30]  Is that a good Texas accent?  I don't know.  Well, it's a racist kind of a...  I'll see, I'll see.  I'll see.  I'll see.  I'll see.  I'll see.  I'll see.  I'll see.  You got Gotham.  You got Gotham.  February 19th through the 22nd.  Yes, sir.  AdamFerrard.com.  Mm-hmm.  Mall Cop.  Mall Cop.  Rescue Me.  New season begins April.  Yeah, let's talk about that for a second.  Well, after the break.  Rescue Me.  Yeah.  Give us the scoop on what the fuck's going on.  I need my new episodes.  You got it. 
[03:08:00]  Opie and Anthony.  And you're listening to my pal, Lil' Jimmy Norton.  He's not my pal.  I thought we said no.  Yeah, we said no.  Asshole.  We're back.  Opie and Anthony.  Adam Farrar in studio today.  I want to hear his name again.  Hello.  Not Adam.  My pal.  Get out!  Adam, you got a big role at Rescue Me?  Come on up.  Yeah, it's nice.  They, uh...  We're wrapping up this shooting so we can start watching the episodes.  They're, uh...  Well, they're getting back to, like, what made the show really funny.  Like, the guys hanging out being guys, and they throw me into the mix, and as being 
[03:08:30]  the young chief, they go into, like, my personal life, and they just give me a really fucked  up personal life.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I can't.  I'm trying to think what I can tell you.  That's, uh...  Don't fuck your job up.  I'm not.  I don't want to fuck it up.  Are you a pedophile on it?  No.  All right.  All right.  Not on the show.  Did they make your hair grayer?  No.  That was kind of creepy.  We know you, and you don't have gray hair yet, but they frosted a little gray in there  for you.  When it started gray, how do you explain it, and then it went white?  What are you...  Who are you, Benjamin Button?  Just for men. 
[03:09:00]  I'm living life backwards.  Yeah.  Give me my black wig.  Maybe I had a darker wig.  I need Liam Neeson.  Looks like a black doily.  Saying fucking things every day.  Liam, here's a Sharpie.  Do your hair.  Oh, that hair.  That is awful and taken.  Holy shit.  They're going to take you.  I told you they were going to take you.  Whoa.  Where are the new episodes? 
[03:09:30]  Uh, we start, uh, I believe it starts the beginning of April.  Nice.  Yeah.  And Michael J. Fox is going to be on this year.  I know.  We heard about that.  Dennis was talking about it.  He's not a waiter, is he?  No.  I'll have the cold soup, please.  Not the hot soup.  Oh, Jesus.  Dennis said he, you know, when he's on his meds and stuff, he's, uh, he's kind of okay.  Yeah.  I didn't have any scenes with him, so.  None?  None.  Did you ever see him?  Not a one.  Didn't even get to see him.  Didn't even see him.  Did you shake his hand?  I did not. 
[03:10:00]  He's done.  As well.  She's going to be, uh, doing a couple episodes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look at you.  It's fun.  Freaking guy.  Why are you in Mall Cop?  Because I don't know if we want, I don't know if we're going to see the movie.  Okay.  I want to screen her.  Did you see Die Hard?  Right?  Did you see Die Hard?  Yeah.  Okay.  So, Kevin is, um, Bruce Willis.  I'm the Twinkie Cop.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  You're the Twinkie Cop.  I'm the Twinkie Cop.  Remember Reginald Van?  What's his name?  Of course.  Yeah.  Okay, partner.  You hang in there. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah.  So, you got any little ones on your ranch?  A lot of the guys love you.  What you're doing down here?  You got a nice part there.  Yeah, it was nice.  Are you getting recognized out there?  Yeah, a couple times.  It was nice.  That's going to be cool.  I know you get recognized in general, but...  Yeah, but no.  But this was like, uh-oh.  But it must have went up, because this movie is like number one in America two weeks in  a row.  It'll go away in a couple days.  Is it?  Yeah.  You know how it is.  A guy like me, if they recognize you in the city, maybe you can get a table a little  quicker.  But it's 50-50 at best. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  Like Long Island, if we go to a bowling alley, you guys ain't waiting for two nights.  I love the jaded Adam, because years ago, you had a sparkle in your eye, and something  like this would have been like this big thing for you.  You'd just been beaten down by the business.  And believe me, I understand completely.  I'm in the same fucking boat.  The business just fucking takes a fist, and gives you that Caligula fucking boom, right 
[03:11:30]  up the ass, and beats you down to where the sparkle goes away.  It's like when the Terminator's head gets crushed, and that red light goes out.  That's exactly what happens.  I'm proud of my pal.  I love the fact that he's in a movie, and he's in this goddamn rescue me and everything.  But years ago, you'd have been doing that bow-legged skip that you fucking did every  time you were happy.  And I love seeing this crushed, beaten, shit on Adam.  We don't see that anymore. 
[03:12:00]  What's the crush?  The little skip.  We know, because I'm there.  I'm there.  He doesn't have the red circle of death yet, though.  I understand.  No red circle of death.  We just realized it is what it is.  Look at me.  I should be goose-stepping in Red Square next to a missile.  That's how crazy I've gotten.  This business has killed me.  He has to sparkle in his eye, though.  A little bit.  No.  He hasn't lost it.  He's ready to cry.  No.  That's what the sparkle is.  It's still fun.  It's tears.  It's still fun.  We still do it.  Jimmy, you still go on the road and do it. 
[03:12:30]  It's fun.  I do, but I don't have a part in a TV show or the biggest movie in America.  No, Mr. New York Times bestselling author.  Exactly.  That and 50 cents will get you a really good blowjob in Singapore.  I meant to say cup of coffee.  That slipped out.  That and 50 cents will get you an Indian hiney to fucking a dump.  Slumdog shitfucker.  That's me.  Don't say slumdog.  Yes.  Don't say slumdog.  Shitfucker's fine.  Yes.  They had the protests on TV and the kids are holding them signs with, it looks like they 
[03:13:00]  were written for them.  Exactly.  That's what I'm getting at, I guess.  We could take the signs, nail them together and make a house.  They did.  Fucking dump protesting.  If you've got the energy to get together to protest something, you could get together  and build something.  Nah, I'm tired of poverty.  Do you know how many roaches must be in that fucking place?  What?  Wow.  What's wrong?  You can't just say I'm tired of poverty.  I am.  I'm not skipping either.  Not me.  My skipping ended years ago. 
[03:13:30]  Years ago.  I'm a miserable fuck.  Just miserable.  I remember at the party.  Beaten down by everything.  I have a job, divorce, everything.  Just fucking took any bit of my soul that enjoyed anything and tore it out.  Tore it out.  I remember we're at the party.  You ever see the predator tear the spine out of his fucking victims?  That was happiness and me.  Mmm.  Oh, is that funny?  Look.  Yeah.  I used to laugh. 
[03:14:00]  We were at the point, went to his house, right?  And I've been there a while.  I said, man, the place looks great.  I'm so proud of you.  His family's there.  Everyone's there.  He's like, yeah, thanks.  You drinking?  No.  For the both of us.  You want to see my guns?  Yeah, I got guns.  The guns.  Yeah.  I like his guns.  My guns.  But you got the one that scares the one by the bed.  Oh, yeah.  The laser?  Yeah.  Because I know you.  You're waiting for someone to break in.  You know what's great about that gun, too?  Mmm.  When I go downstairs, it's got a light, flashlight, and a laser on it. 
[03:14:30]  It's very compact.  And it's on my night table.  So when I go downstairs in the middle of the night, maybe for a snack, I use that as a flashlight.  So I just turn the light on, and then if you shine the laser into the crystals on the chandelier, it looks like a disco.  It's so fucking cool.  So I walk down the stairs, and I shine the laser in there.  And that's the part of the stairs that everybody can see from the street because the chandelier is right there.  That's all they see. 
[03:15:00]  They might see you pointing a laser sight in the chandelier.  Nice.  But then I'm in my pantry with the flashlight on, pointing a .45 caliber into the, you know, to see what I want to snack on.  Maybe some cookies.  Adam.  It's a great flashlight.  And then he decides to shoot a squirrel and eat that.  It's right there.  So I might as well use it as a flashlight, right?  You should know, Adam, that your pal partakes in the pot now, too.  Really?  No!  This is rumor.  This is nothing but rumor and hyperbole. 
[03:15:30]  Well, there was a hyperbole phase, I remember.  It was rumor and hyperbole.  Yes.  It's tough to get good hyperbole.  I didn't say you're like, you know, it's a regular thing, but.  No, no.  I may have been in a room one day.  It was a lot of smoke.  I was breathing because you got to to live.  Sure.  And I felt a little bit of a buzz come on, and it had been years.  Right.  But no, I would never use any type of narcotic like that in any illegal action like that 
[03:16:00]  would not happen.  Right.  Okay.  Never.  All right.  No.  Why would?  Absolutely.  Piss test me right now.  All right.  Who wants to drink it, Jimmy?  No.  I only drink girls piss.  I don't drink boys piss.  No, no.  I only drink the piss of a girl.  Ah.  You relish in it.  It's just a rumor there, Adam.  It's a rumor?  Yeah.  Sure.  Well, I'm not buying it.  It's a rumor.  Yeah, I know.  When was the last time you thought, please.  I remember the last time.  When was the last time you thought, please.  I remember the last time. 
[03:16:30]  Well, the last time I was with you.  That was a long time.  That was when I punched the phone again the same night, right?  No.  No, I was watching Grey Lady Down.  That was what happened.  The sub movie.  That submarine movie.  Yeah.  And I freaked out and went into the bedroom because I felt claustrophobic like the people  in the submarine.  I remember going, Ant, you're really not in the sub.  Yes, I am.  I was frightened.  And I kept saying, I go, I know I'm not in the sub, but I can feel the feeling that you  would feel if you were in there because my mind started like really rolling with it. 
[03:17:00]  And I was like, imagine you're at the bottom of the ocean in a sub and it's ready to crush  like because of the depth and you're in there.  Like, how horrible would that be?  And I'm stuck.  So I was like, holy shit, I'm fucking freaking myself out.  I had to run in the bedroom and I'm on my bed in the fetal position going, God, get  me through this and I'll never smoke pot again.  How do those things cross an ocean?  Not just fear, you just...  Underwater.  And when they all of a sudden go, oh yeah, it drops down about a mile at this point. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  And if the engines fail, we would all be dead.  And the submarine's just going.  People are in there.  Totally straight.  I thought of that shit.  Yeah, but your mind is messed up anyway.  Oh, I can't be left alone with it.  I have to have other things.  Remember when you were a kid, you were getting on a plane and you freaked out because the rivets  were too small on the side of the plane?  They looked pretty small.  Yeah.  And that freak, the rivets are too small.  You see, me and you watch How It's Made and we're like animals looking at fire.  Yeah, yeah.  He watches How It's Made and goes, I can do that. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, I know.  He's got that type of mind.  Yeah, yeah.  I can't be left alone with me in just my mind.  I need a TV.  Oh, I can't be left unattended.  I need to be distracted.  Yeah, like I need distractions.  Yeah, quickly.  Or else you think too much.  Yeah, I got the, when I come home, the TV goes on.  I need background noise.  You stop blinking.  Yeah.  You don't need that.  I need background noise constantly.  Yeah.  First of all, it's to cover up the tinnitus from fucking standing for all my brother's  marshals that he decided he needed to be deep purple. 
[03:18:30]  Uh, so, so I got a constant like.  Well, cause he's deaf in the shotgun.  Yeah.  Oh, remember that?  What happened with the shotgun?  Ah, might have been fired too close to his ear one day.  Yeah.  Might have been.  Another rumor?  Allegedly.  Ah, it was.  A lot of rumors.  Who fired that?  Wasn't us.  I think it happened in the army.  Oh, right.  Somebody put a, like a gun next to his ear and fired it.  Why?  Screwed his ear up.  Why the fuck would they do that?  You know, get the brightest people in there sometimes.  But, uh, yeah. 
[03:19:00]  So I got that going for me.  That whole.  Mm-hmm.  Little tinnitus from the band for so many years.  And, uh, who that wants to think?  Yeah.  It's not thinking too long.  You're like, eh.  Well, cause I always go to like, I go like to protect myself in any situation.  Like what's the worst thing can happen so I can be prepared for it?  Good.  Cause you know, I come from people that don't know what to do with happy.  You met my friend.  You know what happy show?  Like, aren't we having a good time?  Yeah.  Well, shit can happen.  So that's in the back of my fucking mind all the time.  Constantly. 
[03:19:30]  Well, you know my father, right?  Yeah.  It's tough to be positive.  I mean, he's always looking out for you.  But I, you know, I leave.  I try to keep my head high.  I'm going to be positive today.  And I always hear my father's voice.  Like, keep your head down.  You're stepping dog shit.  Pay attention.  There's dog shit.  The world's full of dog shit.  I remember one great big Joe speech that he gave you that sticks out in my mind still  to this day.  Which is?  And it was sound advice.  But I could just picture him telling you this.  You were going to sell your fucking car.  Right.  And get a cheaper car because you couldn't afford the payments. 
[03:20:00]  And your father looked at you and went, you don't go backwards.  Yeah.  You don't, you don't go backwards.  You figure out a way to afford having the car.  Yeah.  You don't go backwards.  It's like, God, that is such a big Joe thing to say.  Yeah.  And you didn't go backwards.  Now, I walked.  Yeah, you fucking walked.  But it was forward.  But I got it.  You were going forward.  Yeah.  That was a good one.  That stuck in my head though over the years.  Don't go backwards.  You could tell Big Joe I was inspired by that one.  I am.  Yeah. 
[03:20:30]  That's funny.  You seem like you would come from a happy family though, Adam.  We had it happy.  Half happy.  Half happy, but more like, because there was like no one helping out.  So it was always like, you know, Pop was always working hard, coming home.  A lot of sarcasm.  A lot of sarcasm.  Yeah.  A lot of like, you know, all right.  You did that, but that was that.  Now what's next?  It's always trying to keep you, like the first review I got was in like Good Times Magazine.  Yeah.  So I brought home.  I brought home from Good Times Magazine.  Feeling all good about yourself.  That's when that sparker was in your eye, pal.  Yeah. 
[03:21:00]  And I show my father a review.  I go, Pop, what do you think?  It's nice.  Next time, once you get into a paper, people got to pay for.  Oh.  Yes.  Yes.  That was it, man.  Yeah.  I was like, it's good enough, but okay.  It's good enough.  For a second.  For a second.  First time I did Letterman, they come in, right?  And I bring them into the city.  My father drove the truck in, and we do Letterman, and I walk out afterwards.  You come around outside, and he goes, you were good.  Help me get this bookcase into the truck.  You got a bookcase?  Get out of here.  Yeah. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  Your mother can't win.  The second he's done with the first Letterman appearance, he's loading bookcases into a truck.  And I'm putting this into the truck.  That's amazing.  He still has his makeup on.  Yeah.  You would think things would be slightly different if you're doing Letterman, right?  No.  It's the same stuff.  Nope.  Same stuff.  Same relationship, whatever.  Yeah.  But it's nice that he's still around, and he's...  He's doing all right?  Yeah.  He's doing all right.  What does he think about you and Mall Cop?  He goes, it's not.  We'll go.  We'll go.  He went to see Definitely Maybe.  He hasn't seen... 
[03:22:00]  No.  He hasn't seen it yet.  I'm going to take him to see it with my mother.  Because he goes, you've got to come with us.  Because last time Definitely Maybe, the movie I was in, they went to see it.  And he goes, we're not going again, because your mother keeps elbowing and punching me.  Joe, there's his name.  I know it's his name.  Joe, that's him.  Joe, he's talking.  So are you.  Yeah.  Is it a good movie?  Definitely Maybe?  Yeah.  It's all right.  It's a good movie.  Well, that's a definite Maybe.  It's a definitely Maybe movie.  No, it's good.  It's Ryan Reynolds with the girls. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah.  With the girls.  With the girls.  Isla Fisher.  But it's good.  Adam Brooks, who directed it, did a really good job.  I had fun doing it, too.  Cool.  Look at you.  It was nice to see.  What?  Hey, pal.  Yeah.  I'll tell you what my father did say.  Is when you guys got in trouble.  Oh, yeah.  But every time, you know, because he always asked about Anthony and Joe and foot and all  those guys.  So you guys got in trouble the first time, right?  Yeah.  And he goes like this.  He goes, the church.  That ain't good.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:23:00]  Big Joe's got a way of saying things.  It's like, oh, shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then the next time where the, whatever the, when he saw it on TV, Washington, he goes,  the president, huh?  At least he's on an earthly plane.  Last time they pissed off God.  Yeah.  That was the lawyer bus.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was a biggie.  Damn, man.  We've had a few biggies.  Yeah.  I think we're due for another biggie.  No.  Yes, we are.  We're not.  No.  We're so ready for another one.  No. 
[03:23:30]  We...  Pay your bills.  Get a little money in the bank so we can do this.  So we can do this thing.  I pay, I pay my bills.  I'm just, you know, I'm in a building phase right now.  Get some of that FU money.  So, cause I think we're ready.  I think we're ready for our next big one.  I'm actually, see, I'm actually, um, living my life with my money.  See?  I live my life.  Come on.  Yeah.  So, um, let me see.  Right there.  I thought I saw Lindsay.  Does she have a blanket for any car rides, uh, that you're gonna... 
[03:24:00]  How about you get a new fucking vehicle for your wife?  What happened?  Yeah.  She's gotta put a blanket on her lap in this jeep that Opie has because there's no heat  on the passenger side.  What?  There's no brakes.  She has to stop the car like Fred Fungeon.  Yes.  You know how many shoes she's been through?  Come on.  I live in this city.  I drive my car once every two weeks.  That's right.  But it's not Honolulu.  It's fucking cold.  Yeah.  What do you do?  Look out the window.  I ask if she wants to drive so she can stay warm.  She don't want to drive.  She wants to sit in the passenger seat and not with a blanket on her. 
[03:24:30]  You want to go for a ride?  Yeah, let me get my Snuggie.  What are you doing?  I have to Snuggie.  Those things are awful.  Ugh.  Front page.  What's worse?  A Snuggie or a fucking freezing car?  Yeah, I know.  She's the only person to ever get frostbite in the passenger seat.  It's safe to say that we probably should live between how you live and how I live.  Well, I'm not-  I will admit that.  I'm not crazy irresponsible like that.  I'm just putting a lot of equity in my house right now.  Uh-huh. 
[03:25:00]  See, I've done a lot of stuff to my house, which, you know, is very expensive.  Right.  That kind of stuff.  You're also putting equity into casinos.  I'm not pissing away.  Yeah.  No, I'm not pissing away as much money as people think I am at casinos.  Really?  Another rumor?  How often do I go?  How many rumors-  How often do I go?  How many rumors are we up to?  Because I'm-  That's rumor and hyperbole.  Another rumor and hyperbole.  Speculation.  All right.  And pure bollocks.  Mm-hmm.  I'm not putting it-  It's like that scene in Lethal Weapon 2 where they have the crate going to Africa with all 
[03:25:30]  the cash in it.  Yeah, well.  Ugh.  Look.  All right, I gotta get a new car.  It's obvious.  Absolutely.  And maybe new shoes, because I gotta-  What do you got?  Oh, what do you got?  Duct tape holding the flapping sole?  What is that?  You have a hole in your fucking shoe!  Come on, it's snowing out!  You're a hobo!  You're a fucking hobo!  It's snowing out!  You have a hole in your shoe!  Look, you would've never known unless I held up the shoe.  No, but your feet probably get wet and get squishy.  Oh, my God.  You are presidential wealthy. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  You're very good.  We can play your Barack song.  What?  We didn't play it with all the fucks and the shits in it.  Really?  We're gonna play this again.  I'm tired.  They made a song for Anthony.  Yeah.  A rap dude.  Which I'm very surprised at, because it doesn't really like those people.  No, it has nothing to do with that.  I'm a very good friend with many African-American people.  Name three.  Name three.  Patrice O'Neal.  Right. 
[03:26:30]  That's one.  That's two.  That's two.  Two to go.  Okay, I also am a very good-  Because someone called me out on this recently, too.  Did they?  And I went, oh, fuck, I got two.  I always say-  Go for three.  Keith.  And one of them was Earl.  Keith who?  Keith who?  Keith Robinson.  You haven't talked to him in three years.  You're not friends with him.  When we talk, we have a good conversation.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  You can't count Keith.  I'm sorry.  You got Patrice O'Neal so far. 
[03:27:00]  Jesus.  I got Patrice.  I'll even give you Black Earl.  Who you just see in passing.  You see him in passing.  Black Earl.  You've never gone out to dinner with him.  Boy.  No, I have, because I've been stiffed on the chick, too.  Oh, okay.  Believe me.  All right, Black Earl.  Fucking skin flint.  Which, by the way, is my second.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  Who do you have?  Those two.  Patrice and Earl?  Yeah.  All right.  Let me think.  Jesus, here's the worst.  Well, I don't have any...  I realize I didn't have Black friends when I looked around the room at my wedding. 
[03:27:30]  Right.  Because I've said for years, shut up, I've got a lot of Black friends.  Patrice O'Neal was the only Black person at my wedding.  Okay, look.  And some other lady and her really hot Black daughter, but I didn't know them.  I might be a little lax on the quantity of friends, but the quality of my friendship  with Patrice O'Neal, I think is very good.  We have a very honest relationship.  You don't know a third Black guy?  Come on.  I don't even know Earl, really.  Yeah, I know.  I don't hang out with Earl.  I wouldn't invite him to a party. 
[03:28:00]  Right.  I don't know him well enough.  I hang out with white people.  Okay?  Apparently, I really hang out with white...  It doesn't necessarily make me racist.  It just makes it that I don't have a lot of common ground.  Wait, wait, wait.  Is that another rumor in hyperbole?  That's speculation and...  Yeah.  Innuendo.  That one is speculation.  Speculation and innuendo.  And that's it?  Yeah.  Rumor?  Rumor.  Bollocks?  Bollocks.  Okay.  I have...  I don't have a lot of common ground with Black people as far as even pleasure goes, 
[03:28:30]  like hanging out and doing things.  Wow.  Black people like hanging out with Black people.  If you watch a lot of rap artists that are hanging out with their posse and they go out  to clubs, there's not a lot of white people there hanging out with them.  Well, there's always the one white guy that's acting black.  Maybe.  They always have that guy.  But it's like there's...  When I watch videos on YouTube, I watch YouTube videos of Black people hanging out. 
[03:29:00]  I couldn't do that.  I couldn't fit in like that.  I'd be like Jimmy when he was growing up trying to fit in with his Kangol hat.  But I'm very comfortable now.  I'm just me.  I'm the fucking whitest guy.  I hang out with a whole bunch of you-know-whats.  I'm fucking completely you-know-whats.  I got...  I got...  I'll be with Patrice or Keith.  A fucking...  I can be with the...  I can be with the...  I can...  Bring me a black person.  I can sit and have a great chat.  It's... 
[03:29:30]  There's no awkwardness or anything.  But I've never had a close friendship with Black people because I don't think I...  I have a lot of common ground there.  And I don't think that that's a bad thing or a good thing or whatever.  It's just the way it is.  I don't...  I don't do a lot of things that I think would interest the majority of black people where  I would then have a lot of black guns.  Because they hate guns.  No, I have legal guns. 
[03:30:00]  I have...  I have registered guns.  Look, I'm just saying...  Wow.  That if there's a party over my house, let's say, it's not conducive to black people coming  over and enjoying that party.  Like, I don't have stuff going on that I see black people enjoying at a party.  I just found my third black friend.  Oh.  Lady Trucker, thank you.  Dr. Ian Smith.  When was the last time you saw him?  He ran out of here last time.  All pissed at you.  Why was he pissed at me? 
[03:30:30]  Because you called him the N-word.  No.  You made him wait.  Really?  Sorry.  I thought I heard that.  You guys have...  I have one black friend than both of you guys put together.  You don't have black friends.  You have fellow colleagues in comedy.  Yeah, but they're guys...  They're people I know well for years.  They are friends.  How many black people besides maybe even Patrice or a prostitute have been in your apartment?  That's not a fair question.  Yes, it is.  I'll tell you why.  Because how many white people have been in my apartment?  I don't have people over unless it's the chick that I'm going to bang. 
[03:31:00]  That's an inaccurate question.  Because Keith has never even been in my apartment.  Florentine's been there once.  All right.  So...  White one, black zero.  Black zero.  No, but you know, nobody comes over.  That's not an accurate question.  People always sit down and be comfortable and spend hours talking to?  Yeah.  Bob Kelly been over here?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  To work out.  Well, whatever.  Whatever the purpose is, I'm just saying.  No, but Jimmy's right.  It's not really like hanging out.  It's different, dude.  I'll sit there with Sherrod Small and talk to him for an hour.  Fucking Godfrey, Artie Foucault, Marina Franklin, fucking Will or Patrice or Todd 
[03:31:30]  Lynn or fucking...  All rights with your Negro list.  But I'm serious.  I think there's guys I know well.  Yeah.  A lot of them, yeah.  And any of them I could travel with and take a flight with or go to the airport with  and be comfortable.  What's my problem?  You're a racist.  No, you just don't...  You come here.  You're insular.  You come here.  Oh.  And Ope, too.  You guys go home.  You Ope's got...  I go to my lily-white community.  Well, you're just hanging out at the house.  I mean, it's like...  I go to nightclubs. 
[03:32:00]  No, I think I'll be at the club.  And I'm with comics, so it's different.  Wait, I asked my doorman how he's doing, and he's black.  Outta boy.  There you go.  I got four.  That's four.  We're counting doorman?  I got six, then.  If I wasn't doing...  I got six.  Wow.  If I wasn't doing comedy, I wouldn't be as mad, but I'm out at night, so I'm in a social  setting at night.  Yeah, see?  Makes it easier for you.  It does.  I'm here, and then I go home.  Yeah, that's so...  What time do you...  You know what you gotta do?  I can't make friends on the road.  Alex Jackson's my friend. 
[03:32:30]  Maybe I need to open up my life a little more to make new friends, make some inroads,  and have a little more diversity in my circle of friends.  I think you just need a website, like jjmolonas.com.  He's got a website.  Yeah.  Quentin Higgs is my friend.  I do visit a website, but...  That's not gonna help.  Maybe.  Hmm.  What do you think?  Nah.  Nah. 
[03:33:00]  Okay.  Nah.  Nah.  Well, you know, it is one of those situations where, you know, the times, they are a-changing,  as Bob Dylan once said.  Mm-hmm.  The answer, my friend.  Yeah.  Let me play your song.  Chris Rock?  I wish was my friend.  I just know him.  Let's see.  It's not my friend.  Let's play your song.  Okay.  Somebody made a song for Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Not a fan of Obama there, Adam.  Anthony or the song guy?  Anthony.  Is it bad that I have a lawn jockey in my backyard?  Yes. 
[03:33:30]  Now, why is the lawn jockey such a bad thing to have?  Um, I don't know, because it's like a porcelain slave.  Yeah.  But it doesn't even have to work.  It just kind of stands there holding a ring.  It's symbolic of old times.  Mm-hmm.  The intention now is probably just through decoration.  But it's, you know-  It's like a confederate flag.  Yeah.  What's wrong with that?  It's part of history.  Yeah.  I wouldn't fly one, because I'm in the North.  But in the South, they do.  You know what?  We're one country. 
[03:34:00]  They got their fucking dicks kicked in.  Yeah.  Fucking put the flag down and fucking get over it.  Yeah.  It's like those idiots in Georgia.  They do Civil War reenactments.  Like it's going to end differently?  You fucking win this time, you moron?  You grits eaters.  Grits eaters.  Grits eaters.  You fucking shitty southern food.  They're very proud of the old stars and bars.  Why?  Well, it's part of their history and culture.  Even though they lost the war, they were very proud of their forefathers fighting for 
[03:34:30]  what they believed in.  Yeah.  Slavery?  They can eat my ass.  Bunch of lazy fucks.  Do your own gardening.  It was more that they were believing in the industrialized North cutting off the South  than really slavery.  I don't think slavery was the number one issue of the Civil War.  It was really an industrialized North kind of cutting off the South.  Don't hit me with fucking facts.  Yeah.  I want a knee-jerk reaction here.  I don't want your fucking knowledge and your accuracy.  You make me sick.  I'm going to go piss next to a black friend. 
[03:35:00]  Okay.  Settle down, you reader.  I'm going to have to be a little more diverse in this time of Obama.  Well, listen.  Or actually, Barry Hussain.  Should we just leave with the Obama song or we come back?  Maybe we come back a little bit.  Come back a little bit.  Come back?  Why are you shaking your head?  And don't come back.  It's like a meeting at noon.  Yeah, we've got a meeting.  Oh, yeah.  We've got meetings.  We've got meetings.  We're going to end with the Obama song, this guy from Buffalo.  What was his name again?  You should get credit.  He did a pretty good job. 
[03:35:30]  Is it on the disc?  It's Barack going to take gas money by Nate S.  A.K.A.  Pharaoh.  Hold on.  Facebook friends count?  Because I got a lot.  Yeah.  Hey, I got some black friends on Twitter.  All right.  They count then.  Good.  Let's start counting them.  Hey, for all my followers on Twitter, I got two really good things.  Yeah.  I'm going to send a picture of the hole in my shoe.  The hole in your shoe.  How you have a hole in your goddamn shoe. 
[03:36:00]  Ugh.  It's winter.  It's snowing out.  Your sock is going to be wet.  I just noticed it.  No one would have known.  Just noticed it.  You can't wear a hole in your shoe fast enough that you hadn't had those shoes too long.  How long have you had those shoes?  A year.  It's time.  For real.  It's time.  How many shoes do you own?  How many pairs of shoes?  How many what?  Like what?  Anything you could wear in your sneakers.  Total sneakers, dress shoes.  Oh, I got like one pair of sneakers for the gym.  Right. 
[03:36:30]  Two pairs of sneakers I like wearing around.  Right.  Obviously not those.  That's three.  You know, you got more shoes than black friends.  And then I got these.  Wow, I remember those.  Yeah, those are old.  No, not really.  And then I got my moon shoes that make me go, whoa, whoa, whoa.  All right, yeah.  Those are relatively new.  The MBTs.  That's five.  I don't know.  Get new shoes today.  Yeah.  How about you get new shoes?  Also, for the Twitter people, I'm going to debut the painting on Twitter, I decided.  Oh, this fucking painting I've never seen. 
[03:37:00]  Wait till you get the wedding gifts out of them.  Yeah.  Did you get the bowl?  Yes, I liked your bowl.  Thank you.  You want to know?  For real.  We had to go for real.  I liked yours.  And all that was left on your register was like a waste paper basket.  A bowl.  Because we got there late.  And I said, honey, I can't get them a fucking waste paper.  They want it.  I'm not sending them a waste paper basket.  Go buy something.  A bowl?  Well, at least you stayed on the list.  Yeah.  There's a reason why, you know, couples make a list.  Yeah.  Because it's the stuff they want.  Yeah.  I want to register at a bank.  Just give me a freaking money. 
[03:37:30]  Well, they start going off the list.  They start doing some off-roading.  Yeah.  Off-roading.  Wow.  You get some things.  Oh, look.  A fondue set.  Look at that.  I got a painting that honestly is very nice.  And the artwork is very nice.  That stinks.  But, uh...  That painting you waved your dick at it.  What's the painting of?  I can't...  It's been the big mystery.  Oh, exactly.  So I'm going to debut it tonight on Twitter.  And...  Opie Radio on Twitter.  Do we know who gave you?  Yes.  J.J. Evans.  Yes.  The guy actually...  He's a local artist from Philly. 
[03:38:00]  He does very well.  Right.  But the problem is, you know, art is like personal taste.  Sure.  So I don't know what to do with this thing.  All right.  So I'm going to take a shot of that.  Lindsey like it?  We don't know what to do with the painting.  All right.  Okay.  So you've got to hang it up if J.J. Evans comes over.  He fucking hates it.  Okay.  Lindsey would rather fucking ride through Alaska in the passenger seat of his truck than fucking  look at that hunk of shit hanging on the wall.  Okay.  If you mailed him a fucking...  If you dropped a deuce on a fucking marshmallow and mailed it to him, he'd hang that up before 
[03:38:30]  that fucking piece of garbage painting.  It stinks!  Hold up the painting and fix your shoe.  Put it in your shoe.  Yeah.  One piece in your shoe.  One piece in the...  The other one's shoving the heating, the unused heating vents.  Yeah.  Dave from Philly, from Radio Gold Fans.  Are they cool?  They're cool?  Yeah.  Thumbs up for them?  All right.  He writes, Opie, I don't know if anyone's ever told you this.  Millionaires have new things.  Buy some fucking shoes and a car for Christ's sake. 
[03:39:00]  Mm-hmm.  What are you doing?  What?  What are you doing?  Saving every dime.  For what?  I'm not saving.  So we can...  So we can say fuck you and leave this stupid business.  I am.  And then what are you gonna do?  No, I'll get...  Wow, this hole's really bad.  Mm-hmm.  I've heard that...  I can feel my heel.  This hole's really bad.  Yeah.  I can feel my heel.  Wow.  Jesus.  Oh, damn.  I knew that at 6.20 in the morning when you were on your eighth dump,  I had a problem with that this morning. 
[03:39:30]  What can I tell you?  I made a lot of mud.  Mm.  Dumping some mud.  All right.  This is the Barack Obama song for Anthony.  It's brought to you by DirecTV.  Call 888-961-DIRECTV.  Yes, Jimmy.  I gotta go.  Where are you going?  Holy shit.  Yeah, I think we're done.  We're all done.  I want to plug Caroline's February 5th through 8th.  I will be there. 
[03:40:00]  Um, there's gonna be some big surprises.  Ooh.  No, there's not.  No, there's not.  I am going to come down.  You should come.  Because I love Caroline's, and I love seeing my friend Jimmy Norton.  They take very good care of the fucking...  Yes, they do.  Greg Charles is a good man.  Good man.  He's a raging alcoholic, but man, does he take care of us.  Oh, Greg is a fucking red-faced drunkard.  What a sock.  What a sock.  A sock.  Wait till I see that fucking sock.  He's too young to have blue veins on his nose.  Oh, no. 
[03:40:30]  Come on.  He's the fucking worst.  He doesn't even have a desk in his office.  He just lays on the floor.  Fucking vomits into a bedpan.  You fucking altie.  Does he still got a tan?  It's not a tan.  He just fucking falls asleep outdoors.  Doesn't count as a tan when you don't mean to get it.  He's red from alcoholism.  Wow.  Oh, shit.  Fuck.  I don't even think he's 40.  He's got the blue veins on that big fucking drunken nose.  His fucking Blagojevich hair makes me sick.  What a fucking...  What a liquored up zilch. 
[03:41:00]  This guy's done nothing but been great to us for years and years.  Yeah, has he?  Why do you think two bottles of liquor always come?  Do you think they know I'm a recovering alcoholic?  Fucking...  He knows it.  He goes, I'll take care of Jimmy's.  And he fucking unscrews the bottom and fucking Caligula drinks it.  What a fucking drunk.  I'm amazed that club's still standing.  Oh, it's amazing.  Yeah, he's a fucking...  Holy shit.  Oh, he's a fucking...  He's an altie.  He's called a functioning alcoholic.  He certainly is. 
[03:41:30]  Jesus.  Good for him.  Good for him.  I always ask, where's Greg?  I don't know.  He's passed out somewhere around here.  Yeah, it's funny.  He always...  You gotta search him out.  I'm looking down at the floor.  I'm making air quotes.  He always spills something on the front of his pants.  Right.  Some would say he pissed them again.  But he always spills some sort of a beverage on the front of his chinos.  Holy shit.  He's a mess.  He's a fucking piss the pants, Bowery drunk with a desk.  Bowery drunk?  He's a fucking Bowery drunk who books comedians. 
[03:42:00]  Good morning.  And you'll be there when...  February 5th through 8th.  I honestly don't even know if he drinks.  I have no idea if Greg Charles drinks.  I think he's ashamed because he makes comesies in his pants.  Aw.  Prematurely.  Yeah, let's start that rumor.  Some of these cars on this frozen road are trying to move now.  Ah, you motherfuckers.  Adam, where are you gonna be?  We gotta get the fuck out of here.  I'm gonna be at Gotham February 19th through 22.  And Mall Cop, which is amazing.  Mall Cop.  And Rescue Me Comes Back.  Now I'm gonna give the movie a try. 
[03:42:30]  Good.  I didn't even know you were in it.  I guess I gotta tell you.  I got a bull leg of it.  We started trashing the movie.  You did?  Just because, I don't know.  Because we're jealous.  I'm embarrassed now.  No, this was before we knew he was in it.  Oh, I know.  Then it put us in a bad spot.  I like Kevin too, so it's always awkward for me.  Aw.  Because I know Kevin for a long time who may want to put somebody else in it, you know.  Absolutely.  From the old days in his pictures.  Alright, here's the Obama song.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Take care.  See you tomorrow.  And about me sounding like a white supremacist over the past week or so since Obama was elected. 
[03:43:00]  I'm seeing things that are happening outside.  I'm experiencing things myself.  This isn't my imagination.  I am being bullied.  That is just what's happening.  Come on.  Come on.  I've been listening on the radio.  To what's going down on the O&A show.  Obama's got Anthony's tickets in a twist.  Yeah.  Something about the facts and the guns in his fist. 
[03:43:30]  Wow.  They're going to take Ant's guns away.  Yeah.  Robbing the rich or the black man's patting down.  Wow.  That's just crazy if you think for a second.  Yeah.  What I want Anthony's chicken is I'm getting to show me.  But she can dismiss me.  Wow.  British.  Yeah, that would sell me.  Am I getting paid?  And ha!  Obama President.  Ha!  That's right.  Rob's gonna take Ant's money.  And give it all up to me.  We're not taking this class.  Rob's gonna take Ant's money.  And give it all up to me.  We're both moving on.  Rob's gonna take Ant's money. 
[03:44:00]  Rob's gonna take Ant's money.  And give it all up to me.  We're moving on.  Rob's gonna take Ant's money.  Give it all up to me.  That's what you do.  You're a high profile radio host.  Dude, I can't take this anymore.  I can't take it.  It's the United Negro.  Call me a bond.  A chicken every bad enough.  Yeah.  One.  To turn in your guns for the common pain.  Shut the ass up.  In the Starbucks for the rink soda machine.  Gonna get me fired to brush it in. 
[03:44:30]  And Anthony's gonna have to take it on the chin.  I'm bumping in the crackers at all stick clear.  It's the black man's time for terror and fear.  Don't worry about the mortgage opinion rates.  Obama's got your back cause heaven says.  And when he's done improving my life.  I'm gonna have more money than Ant's sex life.  Rob's gonna take Ant's money.  I'm not joking.  I'm giving it all up to me.  Give it all up to me.  I'm giving it all up to me.  I'm giving it all up to me.  Give it all up to me.  And in this country, you've been allowed to voice that opinion. 
[03:45:00]  And then have a dialogue about it with other people who disagree with that opinion.  That's great.  It's a great thing.  But we've gotten to this point where you just, you can't do that anymore.  But now I was blind.  But now I was blind.  But now I see.  That's what the president's gonna do for you.  Now you go walk in front of white people's cars.  I'm sick of it.  Do you need a baby aspirin or somethin'?  Shut the f up.  Obama was blind.  But now I see. 
[03:45:30]  Obama, president!  Now!  Rob's gonna take Ant's money.  Give it all up to me.  Is that a bad thing?  We're moving all up to you dumbfuckas.  That's why they make front page news.  Because they rarely happen.  What does happen is groups of black thugs will beat the crap out of white people and rob them. 
[03:46:00]  That's the crap that makes page 17.  Anthony.  What?  Why don't you use the power of the media that you have to try to bring...  I am!  I am!  Thank God I'm here.  Thank Jesus effing Christ.  I am here to spread my word.  You really got to listen to Marianne.  She's making a very good point, I think. </pre>
