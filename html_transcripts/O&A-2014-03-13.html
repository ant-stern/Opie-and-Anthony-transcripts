<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, shifting rapidly between serious news discussions and highly vulgar, often crude humor. The show began with the hosts discussing the harsh New York weather, segueing into speculation about the missing Malaysian Airlines Flight 370, incorporating theories about satellite imagery and potential landing sites.  They also discussed the East Harlem gas explosion and Congressman Charlie Rangel's controversial comparison to 9/11. This led to tangents on the side effects of Ambien, recounted through listener calls describing bizarre experiences; a car crash at the South by Southwest festival; and further conspiracy theories about Flight 370.  A substantial portion focused on the contentious yet ultimately successful recruitment of a controversial caller, "Lady Die," as a paid intern, with much debate on the potential repercussions.  The discussion then pivoted to a news story about alleged "gay" and "bestiality" themes in the Disney movie *Frozen*, prompting a flurry of calls with varying interpretations, ranging from serious analysis to outlandish jokes, eliciting much riffing from the hosts.

The next segment began with a discussion about a children's cartoon soundtrack, which surprisingly segued into a conversation about the hosts' and guest Aaron's musical experiences, including an awkward moment touching upon bestiality.  The conversation then devolved into a graphic discussion about having children, birth control methods, male fertility, and graphic descriptions of ejaculation and bodily fluids. A caller updated the hosts on Cindy Williams' reaction to a previous segment, revealing amusement.  Another caller relayed information from Reddit regarding WWE's displeasure with Jim Ross's story about Vince McMahon soiling himself on live television.  The hosts discussed WWE's response on Raw, featuring JBL and Jerry Lawler's apparent digs at Jim Ross, allegedly at McMahon's behest.  This sparked further reminiscing about their interactions with the McMahons and anecdotes from their WWE careers. A 911 call about a Himalayan cat attacking a child ensued, leading to humorous discussions about aggressive pets and further caller accounts of similar experiences.  The segment concluded with discussions about e-cigarettes and a brief mention of a woman assaulting a reporter outside a courthouse.  Throughout this segment, the hosts used crude and offensive language and provided graphic descriptions of bodily functions.

The final segment started with a listener call about a deceased pet parrot, transitioning to discussions about Jay Leno's potential late-night return and Jimmy Fallon's YouTube success.  This then veered towards a leaked list of Lindsay Lohan's alleged sexual partners, with speculation about individuals named, including Joaquin Phoenix, Zach Efron, Justin Timberlake, and Heath Ledger. A caller, Andrew, challenged the list's authenticity. The hosts then discussed Chris "Birdman" Anderson, a Miami Heat player known for being a difficult interview, playing a recording of an awkward handshake.  The segment featured another call from "Lady Die," initially contentious but concluding with her acceptance of a one-week, $10/hour internship.  This was punctuated by interruptions from other callers and Lady Die's phone difficulties.  A Natty Ice spokesperson called, and another listener voiced support for Lady Die's employment.  The segment ended with scheduling details for Lady Die's internship and plugs for the hosts' upcoming appearances.  Throughout this segment, the hosts used vulgar language and engaged in crude humor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Good morning!  Now, because the show remains real, doesn't mean we're keeping it real.  No, you don't want to keep it real.  No, I don't even know what that means.  We're just real.  Real what?  Look, we're real.  Real assholes.  That could be it.  Who knows? 
[00:00:30]  Real sick of this winter, huh?  Ah, there's that.  Huh?  They called it up for you.  We've got some weird wind today.  Yeah.  Every day it's something different in the New York area.  It's fucking freezing.  Very windy, yeah.  Single digits with the wind chill.  Oh, they love that real feel, temperature, wind chill, whatever you want to call it.  40 to 45 degree winds.  Very cold.  Very cold.  Mile an hour winds, I mean.  You know how fast it is?  40 to 45 miles.  And in the city, it could be zero wind on one street. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  And then you turn around that corner.  You just never know.  And you're like, ah-dee-da-dee-da.  Ah!  Ah!  The wind hits you in the face.  It takes your breath right out of you.  Well, in New York, old people go airborne because of that.  Oh, yeah.  The wind squeezes in between those buildings, comes out the other side a little, a little  stronger.  Yeah.  And, uh, I told the story over the years.  We lose one or two a year around May.  The old people go flying?  They go flying.  One year, one went into one of those big, huge, uh, flower pots. 
[00:01:30]  Oof.  Broke her arm.  Another time, uh, we watched a guy roll down the road.  Oh, you don't want to be that guy.  Just rolling.  You do not want to be the rolling down the fucking city street guy.  I camped out once to try to film people, like, you know, trying to handle the wind, but  it didn't get anything good.  These are just stories I've been told by the security guys.  It's just not pleasant. 
[00:02:00]  No.  Not at all.  You said it's hard to breathe.  Yeah.  It literally is out there.  It's hard.  I kept thinking, this is what it's like to fall out of a plane.  Like, it's freezing, and you can't breathe.  So maybe you wouldn't make it all the way down.  Maybe.  Because that would be a real strong wind and real cold.  Yeah, it's a minus 40.  Yeah.  Suck.  Speaking of.  The plane.  Thought we had a little something yesterday.  Turns out that was nothing.  The Chinese?  What is it then?  I don't know.  It's, they found some debris in the water, but it's not identifiable. 
[00:02:30]  They say it looks like it's pieces that are too big.  Right.  Who knows what that is?  But, uh, I guess it came from some Chinese satellites.  No.  But wouldn't they just tell the world what it is?  Yeah.  The Chinese are saying they made a mistake.  They didn't want to, uh, release that, uh, photo.  Chinese are very mysterious people.  Absolutely.  They're mysterious. 
[00:03:00]  They don't like playing well with others.  They, like, whenever there's a world crisis, they keep their cards very, uh, close to the  vest, as they send them.  Right.  Didn't they send some, uh, ships, though, or some, uh, they sent something.  They did, huh?  Yeah.  Uh, it says satellite images may show missing plane, but hasn't that already been kind of  discredited?  No, it's a different one.  I think it's a different one.  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  Six days just disappeared.  Mm. 
[00:03:30]  I don't know.  So where is the plane?  With all of the technology, it's just astounding.  The plane just went away.  I know the Earth is very big.  The ocean's a big place, but, uh, everything we got, the old, um, projections of where the  plane should be, things like that, you'd think they'd find it pretty quickly.  Big plane, tell you.  I don't know.  What went wrong?  Flight 370, what went wrong? 
[00:04:00]  They could, they could roll out as many experts as they, they want.  Don't mean shit.  None of these guys know anything in the end.  Nope.  They're just guessing like we are.  Yeah.  It's all speculation.  Yeah, they seem floating, I think.  They think they seem to be floating.  No, that's old now, though.  Is that out?  Yeah, yeah.  The paper has the, the satellite image, and that's now old.  They're basically saying, yeah, that's nothing.  I don't know. 
[00:04:30]  I don't know.  Imagine the first time ever they, they actually find that it's intact somewhere and something  just went awry and people are just like, oh, it's been a week.  Where the fuck have you been?  Right.  I think the problem is the transponder not working, no signal.  That's just too weird.  I've been sent.  No signal, I've been sent.  Has there ever been a plane that has completely disappeared like this?  I don't know.  Not in recent. 
[00:05:00]  No, not recently.  Right?  They always find something, eventually.  They thought they found Amelia Earhart's plane not long ago.  Yeah.  They saw photographs like in the ocean or something of what could be like a landing gear.  Yeah, yeah.  When listed overdue for a week.  Yeah.  I'll never buy freckled skin cream again.  Because that was what they found in the thing that she had freckles.  Freckled skin cream.  She was very freckly. 
[00:05:30]  Freckly idiot she was.  Probably applying it when she fucking went down.  Flumsy broad.  I think she was an oldie time lesbian too.  Was she?  Yeah, that was speculation.  Very into her, you know, flying.  Not so much into, you know, men.  Wow.  Maybe she was flying to a place that accepted her.  Maybe.  Her sexuality.  Well, gentlemen, Amelia Earhart is single.  She was just flying to some native lawns to get a little action in. 
[00:06:00]  Other boys.  Right.  So, well, they thought they found something yesterday.  It turns out, nope.  Yeah.  So now they're just back to trying to figure out where the hell this plane is.  That's something.  Satellites focused in there.  Fucking other satellites that apparently can detect explosions.  Mm-hmm.  That didn't find anything.  I don't know.  And then, obviously, other countries, including the U.S., don't want to give up their assets 
[00:06:30]  and say what they do have.  That's probably another sensitive issue.  It's like, oh, yeah, we got this satellite image of this.  Mm-hmm.  You don't want to show that because you don't want other countries going, oh, you can do that?  Right.  Well, look what we could do.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a little, you don't want to let other countries know what you can do.  Sure.  Maybe they'll turn up.  Maybe not. 
[00:07:00]  They're dead, but I mean, like.  You think, yeah?  Of course.  They're completely dead.  Yeah.  And it's crashed.  It would be amazing, though.  That'd be a greatest story of the last.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  I can't think of how many years last week.  I pulled a Sully.  They're just floating, trying to keep the thing on top of the water.  That's what I said.  Maybe a water landing, and now it just slowly sinks to the bottom.  Oh, boy.  Well, they do have rafts and stuff.  They don't have food or water for six days.  No plane is equipped for a six-day mission. 
[00:07:30]  You're in a little life raft, and the flight attendants are telling you to pay for your little food.  Still.  Can we swipe your credit card?  No, no, my luggage is in the ocean.  Yeah, yeah.  Can we swipe your credit card?  Hey, Godspeed there.  What are you going to do?  And then another huge story yesterday, and then when they realized it wasn't, like, terrorism or anything, they just...  And it's bad, whatever.  Or it wasn't enough people that died.  Yeah.  They moved away from the story.  It's very interesting to see these news cycles. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It turns out it's a natural gas explosion, I guess, up there in East Harlem.  Yep, the old gas pipe.  It's like taking out a tooth in the city.  Yeah.  The whole building is gone.  Or two buildings, right?  Two buildings right next to each other.  Boy, did you hear enough time that there was a church on the bottom of one and a piano store on the bottom of the other?  I was watching the coverage yesterday on Channel 2 locally here in New York, and, boy, they had nothing. 
[00:08:30]  But they just keep juggling and trying to get something out of people.  Oh, could you please ask that person?  The anchor's back at the desk.  Could you ask that person if they heard a loud kaboom?  Kaboom!  They wanted it to be some kind of bomb so badly, right?  They always wanted it to be a bomb.  Terrorism.  Something out of the ordinary.  Something that isn't just a gas explosion.  Oh, boy.  Could it be? 
[00:09:00]  We're going to have people, investigators are showing up.  It is probably not terrorism.  But nothing's been ruled out just yet.  Well, Charlie Rangel there.  Charlie Rangel's an idiot.  He's elected 8 billion years up there in Harlem.  He's a really old guy, too, right?  Yeah, he's just some old codger that's, you know, milking the job.  And, yeah, he said, this is our community, which, you know, Harlem, this is our community's 9-11. 
[00:09:30]  This is Harlem's 9-11.  Right.  It's like, wait, wasn't 9-11 9-11?  Right.  Wasn't that bad enough for the entire city?  How is it his community's 9-11?  I don't know.  It's a horrible tragedy, obviously.  Yeah.  But I think it's two, what are they up to, like six killed?  Six dead, nine missing, 60 injured.  Right. 
[00:10:00]  And, yeah, the numbers fall a little short of your 9-11.  It's not terrorism.  Although two buildings blew up, they were not the financial epicenter of the free world.  You know, I think he might have overplayed it a little bit.  Didn't people smell gas for years, too?  Yeah.  Yeah, that'll come up, too, where I'm sure some of the community activists will say,  ah, what's it take for Harlem to get some people up here to investigate the gas? 
[00:10:30]  The gas smell.  What's the gas smell?  If it was a white neighborhood.  Yeah.  That's kind of scary, though, you're smelling gas.  They said for years.  Years.  For years they smelled gas in those buildings.  And then it finally went.  Damn.  And, man, those gas explosions, they don't mess around.  Wow.  Once you get a nice pocket of that built up, and then it gets a little ignition source.  Oh, man, it just comes apart. 
[00:11:00]  Those buildings got blown the fuck up, man.  Like, there's nothing left.  Yeah.  No.  And then I saw some video they were showing on the news yesterday of some gentlemen in  the area that had their phones going that were running to the scene saying, we've got to  help people.  Right.  We've got to help people.  And I'm like, ah, portrait mode.  Fucking portrait mode.  It's just amazing.  Let's say hi to Brian in Charlotte.  He has a little more on the Charles Wrangel angle. 
[00:11:30]  Or the Charlie Wrangel.  Charles or Charlie.  I don't know.  What's up, Brian?  Hey.  He did what infuriates me.  He referred to it as 911.  He didn't even refer to it as 911.  He says 911?  No, he says 911.  That's silly.  He's an old, out-of-touch fool that those dummies up there still vote for.  Who blamed this situation on gentrification.  So he's taking a page out of the Spike Lee book.  Wait, he said that?  Oh, yeah.  On CNN, they actually had to cut the guy off.  He was an independent journalist for Harlem. 
[00:12:00]  And he was trying to blame it on gentrification, saying that the landlords who've taken over  these buildings don't give a shit about the people who live there.  So they're fine.  They blow off course.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Thankfully.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what gentrification does.  Gentrification.  You want to blow the building up.  As opposed to pre-gentrification.  Yeah.  Which was a bombed.  It looked like a bombed out city of Beirut.  Yeah.  Nothing's ever good. 
[00:12:30]  Nothing.  It doesn't matter what is done or isn't done.  It's never good.  Let's go to Scott in New York.  Scott.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, man.  Rolls-Royce monitors their engines.  And Fox News reporting that they were running four hours after the transbond went off.  Yeah.  Then there's another report that's not true.  There's conflicting reports about that.  I heard that this morning, too.  Yeah.  Like they have...  It transmits information to a server. 
[00:13:00]  Right.  And I guess they could get engine data from it.  Yeah.  The ring for that time could be all the way to Pakistan, which conspiracy theory, I don't  know, but crazy.  No.  The plane...  I don't believe the engines were running two hours later.  No.  Four hours or something.  Four hours or whatever.  Four hours after the transbond went off.  Right.  Because somebody would have seen it land somewhere.  You don't land just on a field.  I mean, look, if Nicholson didn't even know if they saw... 
[00:13:30]  Those two soldiers saw the plane land in a few good men.  Right.  There's no way you can land a Malaysian airliner.  The whole world is looking for...  Not one person calls in and goes, yeah, it was on the ground crew.  We saw it.  What if they landed it in Pakistan somewhere?  Somebody would talk.  Some kind of...  I don't know.  All right, boy.  Old dirt...  They carved a runway out of the jungle somewhere, somewhere.  But then...  But then what?  Then you load it up with explosives and you fly it into something big. 
[00:14:00]  But then people would know that plane's in the air, no?  Yeah, they'd know there's a problem.  What do you mean?  Once they take off again?  Yeah.  No, you get that transponder off, you fly low, you fucking crash right into something.  Like what?  Building.  Where?  United States.  Okay.  You fly across the Atlantic now, you fucking fly right into something big.  Conspiracy people must be having a field day with this one. 
[00:14:30]  They certainly are.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Phoenix.  Jeff.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning, Jeff.  Yeah, I heard on Fox News breaking news at 3 o'clock this morning that there was a sensor  in the engines on the plane that sent a beacon or some shit to Rolls-Royce, their main facility.  And they said that the plane kept flying for another four hours, or at least...  I hadn't heard that. 
[00:15:00]  It's now in Pakistan.  Wow.  And what?  It's now in Pakistan, according to Steve Ducey on Fox News.  Isn't the...  Isn't...  When you're on hold, doesn't the show play?  Yeah, I think so.  Sir?  No, you guys already said that.  I didn't hear that.  That's all right.  But...  Ah.  He's all bummed now.  But there's conflicting reports that that's not true.  So, I don't know.  I think...  Pakistan. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  Leave it to Fox to fuck it up.  Not really.  I think it came from the Wall Street Journal or something.  Oh, is that where it was?  I believe, or...  Yeah.  Either way, I'm an idiot.  That's what I get for not listening.  Oh, boy.  Oh, sir.  Now, this guy says the plane doesn't use Rolls-Royce engines.  What?  I heard Rolls-Royce all morning.  Of course, it's a Boeing.  Right.  Rolls-Royce.  Rolls-Royce.  Rolls-Royce engines.  Yeah, Boeing's used Rolls-Royce on their 7-7-7-7-7.  Yeah. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, that's what I hear.  Oh, well.  And then you got a car crash in the...  South by Southwest.  Yeah.  In Austin.  What happened?  What, a guy just purposely drove into a crowd?  Is that what happened?  Damn.  The incident happened outside the Mohawk, a bar and live music venue on Red River Street  in Austin around 1230 a.m.  and uh it killed uh two people injured 23 he just he just plowed into a whole bunch of people  he was drunk oh they're saying he was just drunk he had hit a cab previously and then he just kept 
[00:16:30]  on going and then when he barreled in all those people he got out of the car and tried to run  away how do you jerk off do that what a god what a fucking jerk off jesus christ wow i don't know  how that how the fuck do you get into a car when you're that fucked up it's astounding amazing  maybe blacked out or something maybe we'll use the i was blacked out excuse 
[00:17:00]  that never works no one's ever gotten out of jail by being in a blackout yeah never  kennedy got off uh for that ambien thing really and and yeah yeah that's that's done yeah that  that was done deal wow no kidding yeah they said nope no problem we we agree with you that she  mixed up her pills mixed up your little pills and she's a kennedy yeah we know what happened she's 
[00:17:30]  a kennedy that's what people are saying too well they don't have a good track record those kennedys  they have a good track record of getting off the hook well except for that one skickhole guy they  could get the best lawyers and they got a lot of dough yeah i i really believe that does help you in  a case oh certainly does wow they let her go yep what was the story she uh she took an ambien before  she left the house and thought she was taking some other medication right she didn't hurt anybody right  or crash her car she crashed she did yeah she hit a side swipe some vehicle um and was said she was 
[00:18:00]  completely like passed out didn't even know took that ambien but oh i took it by accident by accident  and the prosecution's whole case was well it doesn't matter if you took it by accident or not  the second you realized you were uh kind of intoxicated on uh anything you should have uh  stopped driving and she's like i don't even remember doing that yeah but there's got to be 
[00:18:30]  some accountability apparently not in the end she she was on ambien not for a kennedy yeah it's what's  rare that they get off for things yeah huh wow even skakel's out of jail on a pending appeal  skakel that's the old golf club guy yeah yeah he's suing nancy grace too oh yeah for a lot of money  it looks like she's in trouble oh man she's in dutch apparently uh i'm i'm paraphrasing but i think  her show said something about how there was dna evidence found at the scene oh and it wasn't 
[00:19:00]  there was none oh boy so the judge ruled against their motion to dismiss because they were saying  well you you're not why you can't be liable or whatever if or whatever the word is uh if he's  already convicted of murder and it's like that's not true yeah you can't throw on a bunch of yeah  fake facts you get piggy girl yeah courtroom cunt hashtag nice yes sued piggy  i think it i think it sucks that you mixed up your medication but you should be accountable for 
[00:19:30]  that don't you think yeah no well it's uh what if it's one of those what they call honest mistakes  what if she actually did grab a pill thought it was for her thyroid or something and popped an ambien  she's driving and then all of a sudden you wake up and they tell you what happened well and you're like  holy fuck what let's add to the equation she kills people while she yeah while she did that she would 
[00:20:00]  still be let off the hook because she'd made a mistake at home i i guess uh yeah wow now there  should there could be some accountability on the fact that like if you take ambien perhaps you should  keep it in a bottle that doesn't look anything like the other medicine bottles or not if you're  locked up if you're on prescription pills i think you got to have some responsibility absolutely  yeah you can't say that because you got to have some kind of awareness like oh boy i better not  mix up these uh these pills that ambien's some crazy ass shit it really is you could take it and 
[00:20:30]  then decide to go driving too like you know she could say i didn't know i took it or maybe she took  it then just say because ambien makes you do crazy shit right yeah so there's a congressman that got  off the hook a few years back for the same thing he was driving they pulled him over he was weaving  all over the place um acted like he was drunk and um said no it was ambien took it i didn't even know  he was home took it to go to sleep went to bed and then the next thing he knows he's in jail 
[00:21:00]  like like he got up got into his car drove that's without any knowledge that he was doing any of this  and i guess the jury believed him too because they let him off he's probably telling the truth i mean you  can't do stuff in those like ambien blackouts make phone calls i don't remember there's that  reasonable doubt part of it because there are documented cases so if you present the jury with  those things and say that it happened to me the jury's got to look and go you know what  we got to kind of go with his story on this one right let's say hi to josh in boston josh i'm not 
[00:21:30]  going to believe anything he says because i know anyone that's teasing the entire city of boston  you said that um that all the kennedys got off except that skakel guy yeah he actually he actually  has new trial coming up so he's probably going to get off too he might yeah he's out now but uh i guess  his new trial is starting and yeah yeah what got him out like what was the oh fucking the council 
[00:22:00]  wasn't good enough yeah it was one of those technicalities my wife is ambien and i hate that  family i've woken up to her blowing me not even knowing it i've woken up to her cleaning the whole  house walk up to a spotless house and went what the fuck happened turns into the perfect wife exactly  what else does she do make cookies and clean the toilet this is the god pill  holy shit sometimes she'll take an ambien when the game's on not say a word 
[00:22:30]  she'll cheer for my team she eats my ass during the commercials yeah why are you complaining i would  be giving her ambien every single day yeah just push those ambien's in those donuts yeah i'd crush  them up like sugar go ahead put them on your coin flicks right but yeah it's some crazy shit so i  don't doubt that that happened you know though this shit people do i've seen it firsthand so it is  amazing that it's still available if this is what's happening legal yeah yeah well now that everyone  has stories about ambien on the phones thank you sir let's go to chris the teacher a regular to the 
[00:23:00]  on a show on long island what's up chris hey good morning uh i uh read doc gooden's uh biography  because of your actually i think one of your best interviews ever i think it's around this time last  year was it a year ago already it was great wow yeah great book man very thank you for the  recommendation cool um he had the same problem with the ambien blame now he has a little bit of a track  record but he blamed ambien uh for one of his driving under the influence stops when he had his 
[00:23:30]  kids in the car he ended up on somebody's lawn and can i ask professor anthony a question oh boy  yes sir it's legit uh surely i believe your theory on pilot suicide i really do i think that  what's the point of turning off the transponder you think it's for insurance  uh yeah yeah it could it could have also been because that was the moment that there was some  kind of catastrophic problem right that's what they're saying too like cracks around the antenna 
[00:24:00]  that transmits uh the transponder signal you know it could be the antenna got blown off yeah yeah  yeah seems like the pilot was the pilot was a happy-go-lucky guy though yeah he didn't seem to be a guy  that uh he had broads in the cockpit he had a flight simulator at his apartment he just loved flying  he looked happy in those videos in those pictures they showed yeah but jimmy looks happy too but we  all know what he goes home to every night i say that with love maybe it was the co-pilot maybe the 
[00:24:30]  co-pilot fucking clocked him in the head with something and put that thing in a dive man who knows  i don't know until they find it uh what are you gonna do speculation uh let's go to bill in florida  bill hey guys hello bill hey buddy hey so i i just wanted to throw an ambient story out there  a few years ago i was um i took one and went to sleep and i woke up and i was in the uh emergency

[00:26:30]  felony murder aggravated vehicular homicide vehicular manslaughter and assault he's facing life i'm not  saying he shouldn't but he's at a party having fun probably in a blackout obnoxious asshole walks home  he steals a delivery truck like one of those things that you never do sober and fucking just plows into  a bus and kills a guy oh man that guy's dead and then you like come out of it and go the rest of  my life i'm fucking yeah that's it done it's 23 that's damn fucking amazing how fast you can fuck 
[00:27:00]  everything up in like one 10 minute spot or whatever your whole life is ruined  them wacky little crossroads yeah right like if he had just gotten into a cab or maybe if he had just  not grabbed one ass at that party and gotten thrown out yeah he would have puked and made who knows  and this guy would be alive yeah jet may have gone 2200 miles off course is now the latest  and the malasians are denying that there were signals coming from the engines those are the 
[00:27:30]  the that's the latest right now as we see it how they say may have gone 2200 miles unless that was  just the amount of fuel they had they might be speculating just because that's how much fuel they  when they took off airborne for hours plane in pakistan engine data jet may have flown five  hours this is all speculation question mark that's all yeah they plane on moon right yes  plane taken by aliens or okay question mark plane found with giant yankee hat yeah that'd be 
[00:28:00]  interesting i'm just happy to say that the aliens thing is still still on the table still a viable  scenario yeah i got a little bummed yesterday when i saw that satellite image i'm like oh man  there goes the alien yeah there goes the aliens theory still on the table boys yeah a sinister plot  missing jet diverted for a different use oh wow fox is going with that oh no it's not a sinister plot 
[00:28:30]  it's a sinister plot how to write in the twenty nine people are three nine people can just vanish  but do we know that the trans and the one thing we want what i think the waters are there that is the  chinese have a lot of resources uh... is the recovery of what was left of the plane because they showed  us some aerial shots and it looked like it could actually be plane wreckage they got there it wasn't  it we also heard two days ago that the left turn they think that the plane allegedly made uh... well they  did make it then by the end of the day they said i don't know where you think that that story came 
[00:29:00]  from we didn't do that and and by the way here's a uh... here's some of those aerial shots that we  were looking at yesterday and those were taken on sunday and by the time they got there it doesn't  look like plane wreckage saying wreckage or they simply drifted way off a lot of the a lot of the  experts said it didn't look like plane wreckage right away they said the pieces were too big so what  is he saying they it looked like plane wreckage it was a very blurry satellite image and they did some  some measurements that said these pieces are too big a lot of the experts said that immediately 
[00:29:30]  but then they were still holding out hope every news channel has a different  bunch of talking heads that give different opinions msnbc is blaming bush  so it's just a weird story imagine that plane never turns up like you will know it probably  disappeared in the ocean but yeah for that to happen in 2014 a modern 777 to take off  it's gotta be almost impossible it has to be yeah that air france plane off of brazil 
[00:30:00]  uh that was gone for a while right they did find it but then it took a long time for them to actually  get to it it was in really deep water um and it took a long time to to get to it but for this without  anything well they kind of knew what happened they knew something yeah yeah in the storm it  went down like there was no doubt that plane just crashed yeah yeah yeah there's no this guy didn't  run into any weather or anything yeah no distress signal had been sent didn't they find the bodies 
[00:30:30]  and stuff recently like on an underwater mountain like that's where they found a lot of that stuff  yeah for the uh air france flight really wow a shitty way to go falling you don't want to fall no  for a long time let's say hi to jason in boston jason hey guys how you doing pretty good jason hey so  i'm calling about ambien i've been taking ambien for about two years man and i'll tell you this is a  fucking godsend um i wouldn't sleep for like two three days straight um you know i'm still really kind of 
[00:31:00]  out of it but i'm like functional for the first time in maybe 10 years um i haven't done any crazy  but i do have a half of like eating random stuff from the fridge so like i'll get up in the morning  my wife will go to make her sandwich for work and she's like yeah there was a half a pound of cheese  in here yesterday what happened i'm like half a pound huh half a pound yeah well like apple pastrami  a jar of pickles oh my god must be a joy that toilet in your house a real treat after a half pound of 
[00:31:30]  cheese oh my god oh god that will bind you up pretty good oh my god play-doh fun factory  out of the bunghole or when it finally planks out it's hard as a rock you're struggling and struggling  and a little fucking a granite fist falls out yeah yeah but she needs grocery shopping because  she knows i'm gonna like eat everything in like three days and have absolutely no memory when it  happens that ambien wow i don't know some people swear by it as far as sleep goes right now it's 
[00:32:00]  awesome though man i mean that's two years it's really helped me a good deal i know a lot of people  talk about it but it's really been pretty good for me hey i gotta get to work guys i'll punch out you  just talked about it he's like i know a lot of people talk about it but i woke up and ate a  fucking half pound of cheese i've got a big star on the line big star colin quinn hi guys oh hi colin  hey call what are we doing wrong today colin yeah whoa i liked colin uh 
[00:32:30]  let's make this our overriding narrative every yeah every time yeah maybe colin's just calling  in as a fan of the show to contribute what you got on the plane crash col  nothing on the plane crash guys i'm calling in to contribute uh it is something you're doing  slightly wrong instead of just criticizing diana i'm putting out maybe you guys hire her  to get her paid up her resume as like a cute intern for a few months like a madman type situation 
[00:33:00]  lady dies should be an intern on our show yeah it's not a bad idea oh no it's a terrible idea  it's a great idea she could be a paid intern a paid intern for uh for the spring i like this idea  i really do thank you oh oh could you imagine her having to go get stuff how long can we last  with her as a paid intern she'd be terrible till 8 15. put her on the phones think of the thing  of the call how are you how are you what do you want to talk about but you're in like cute little 
[00:33:30]  like outfits like late like mid-60s kind of mid-60s like groovy chicks from london outfits  like a fucking you know gal friday type thing yeah like a pan am steward or something  i like the idea can we get some money from the uh oh that's right we're gonna have a budget well  who's gonna pay her oh that's right what's that oh could she be an intern for a month sam first of  all she won't show up half the time that's true she'll be all hung over the whole problem the reason 
[00:34:00]  she can't get hired the dollar store is because she has no job experience she has that gap in her resume  right yeah people wonder if you know she was doing time it's crazy hey call i like your tweets  about the regular people oh yeah that was very good call you know he likes getting out there and  mingling with the regular people you know yeah kind of keeps them grounded i like to reach down to 
[00:34:30]  the fans once in a while reach down do you know how enraging it is when you when you when you refer  to everyone as team team hey hey team oh i want to stuff on my phone there's such great tweets man  where are you i just love you i'm going i'm in my house right there oh i just love the idea i just  got this vision yesterday of diana you know i've been meditating and stuff lately and i got this vision 
[00:35:00]  diana in like a little 60s office running around this thing doing her you know oh that would be  great just helping out that thing with you guys right like madmen i i love it obviously but let's  hopefully nothing gets you know can we call up uh lady dine see if she would be interested in being  our intern for a month and i think the important thing is how you're saying meditation is fairly  worthless yeah that's the that's the conclusion that you come to i'm looking for some peace and  spirituality and just think of that pig running around in a short shirt i do like it imagine lady 
[00:35:30]  die uh pulling out a little pad and then she takes some some greasy pin out of her hair because you  know that oil slick on her head what do you need what do you want what do you want oh yeah why do you  come in call i can't i gotta go up i'll come in monday yeah i'd love to yeah um so let's get lady die  on the phone let's play this out a little bit she hasn't uh she hasn't risen to the morning yet oh she 
[00:36:00]  hasn't almost uh that natty ices are calling so it'll be soon exactly she's probably up doing calisthenics  oh sure she couldn't get to her phone she's doing her morning exercise she's probably tuckered out from  uh looking for a job yesterday at the dollar store with the monkeys playing she may have some secret  you know typing skills that we don't know about oh maybe huh you know typing typing but maybe in a  steno pool right hey do you like the meditation uh yeah it's all right is it helping well it came up 
[00:36:30]  with a great idea yesterday yeah that was i mean but does it make you feel better so you're supposed to  push those visions and thoughts down yeah you know that call that's what meditation is all about  you allow them to happen but don't go with them no it's supposed to be just the opposite way you're  supposed to let every thought come out true but you're not supposed to focus on them too much i've  been meditating for like a couple of years and the only great thought i've come up with is that one  yesterday that's it huh yeah that's what i've come up with that's a good one though 
[00:37:00]  fuck yeah i'm playing this out we're going to get on the phone in about an hour and we're going to  try to make this work see if she can do it but she's going to have all sorts of problems with this  as as we try to help her what kind of daily rate would she require yeah that's a good point well  it'll be up to her we'll ask her yeah you know she's got to be reasonable she's a she'll be a paid  intern minimum wage minimum wage oh you think she's going to say that yeah she probably would yeah 
[00:37:30]  she's got a low self-worth thing going i think she played hardball shorted real money and benefits  i'm a bonus  she's uh she's a treat isn't she just a treasure she's a treasure we got to put her on our list  american treasure american treasures yeah she is she's the positivity  you know she is really now yeah i'm sorry carl now people are going with your idea already they 
[00:38:00]  want us to start a kickstarter to raise the money for lady die's salary oh yeah i mean for sure  so that's where how we can get the money can you put a you can put a limit on how much money you  need from kickstarter right sure because we don't want her to get too rich from this oh no she won't  show up right exactly if she shows up every day she gets a nice crisp hundred dollar bill wow  per day per day if we could raise it from kickstarter 100 bucks a day that's huge that's like what  manix used to make plus expenses oh like peggy manix's secretary right yes wow that's great 
[00:38:30]  manix all right calling our food's here so we're gonna break the best part about this is it's gonna  make norton sick every day yeah i'll be honest it won't be well received by me but i'll fucking  well let's we'll we'll call her and see if she's at least interested yeah all right guys thank you  colin see you i like the positive phone call today this was nice i know yeah very nice i'd rather have 
[00:39:00]  him criticize fucking so much than call him with this awful idea this guy has us all on guard all  of a sudden who is he thanks colin whatever colin quinn hey team oh hey team oh no one's a  fucking member of the team he put regularly like like uh it's always good to hang around with the  regulars and he put them in quotation regulars and they posted like a picture of some construction 
[00:39:30]  workers i'm like oh these guys yeah yeah you know i like talking to these guys there's obviously a  fence between them too in the picture yeah of course i'm not hanging out with them no hey team  his quotes are funny he loves everything quotes and by this i mean his life yeah his dumb quotes  so now we gotta call lady die we'll do that hopefully soon as soon as she wakes up we'll  have her on the air at the crack of natty ice that's right and um oh oh we oh we need that cat 
[00:40:00]  call from yesterday yeah i never got all right so what but guy calls 9-1-1 over a cat guy who's a  fucking asshole to go in there and just drop kick the thing i don't know man cats can be scary you  know that they are i've heard the stories over the years they can be downright scary they start  making those noises we'll try to do that next stay there 
[00:40:30]  anthony what's going on guys whoa listen to this i like this  pastor claims frozen is what a gay movie or something really i saw frozen  what was gay about that movie uh one lots of uh once now no it's not on dvd yet  travis is in frozen hell i guess oh really i i think i've seen that movie more than any other 
[00:41:00]  movie i've ever seen wow my every day you're spending a lot of money going to the movie theater  every day oh yes that's gotta be adding up after a while so what's the deal with this frozen movie  there sam roberts why is it a gay movie some saying the gayest movie ever also promotes bestiality  yeah drawing the gay agenda what's all the gay agenda yes what do you mean  what do you mean there's gay undertones undertones undertones how about this they've never actually 
[00:41:30]  seen frozen ah but generations radio co-hosts it's radio guys saying this yes like conservative radio  people oh okay are concerned about the disney flick that grossed one billion dollars worldwide since its  release in november they argue that animated that the animated musical featuring the voice talents of  christian blah blah blah blah blah indoctrinates homosexuality and bestiality nice the movie frozen 
[00:42:00]  uh now i want to see promotes homosexuality absolutely and bestiality i couldn't agree more  i like that what is she for is is the princess fucking some animal no but uh there's there's a guy in  the movie and his best friend is a reindeer that's right and they're gay and they have sex together  apparently i mean that's the implication for sure i don't know if that's a deleted scene  but uh have you you've seen it a few times have you uh noticed a gay it didn't make me want to 
[00:42:30]  have sex with animals more no no than before i watched it okay that's josh gad does the voice of  the snowman uh-huh and uh he's terrific i agree friends this is evil just evil ranted swanson who's a  pastor swanson i want to go over there while feminists have praised the movie for not succumbing  to the princess meets prince arch type swanson believes the house of mouse is secretly trying  to push its left-wing agenda on the masses ah man how many children are taken into these things and 
[00:43:00]  how many christians are taking their kids off to see the movie frozen produced by an organization that's  probably one of the most pro-homosexual organizations in the country this is where the right just loses  droves no they're not i think these guys are 100 right oh okay these are your boys and my boy  it's what your boys are saying so many boys i didn't even isolate that  yeah did you wonder sometimes if maybe there's something very evil happening here evil if i was 
[00:43:30]  the devil what would i do to really fell up an entire social system and do something really really  really evil to five six and seven year olds who's a gay and christian families around america swanson  then answered his own question saying if i was the devil i would buy disney in 1984 that's what i  would have done this is just nonsense right no this guy's right that's what the devil would do he'd buy  disney yes are they shock jocks this sounds like shock jockery then he would start making all these 
[00:44:00]  nice little movies that throw little things in there and make sin look enticing in fact some of the worst  of sins make it look enticing or at least to start to indoctrinate slowly turn the heat up on the frog  in the pan saying very slowly turn that heat up right uh men argue that groff's character christoph has  an unnatural relationship with his animal's fin swanson noted that the walt disney company altogether is  leading the charge to the sewers of sodom they do like a good gay absolutely terrible organization 
[00:44:30]  oh boy they're sinful sinful don't they have gay day at disney yes everyone wears absolutely yeah  promoting it promoting making people gay everyone wear they make people homosexual right disney is a  creator of homosexuals and if i was the devil uh-huh i would probably go to the disney theme park one  day just to see just to check it out yeah i'd wear my mickey ears over my devil horns so nobody knew it 
[00:45:00]  was me and then i'd purchase disney it's very obvious though with your cloven hooves yeah  trying to get on the ride with your cloven hooves exactly he no one would like him in the board  meetings the new boss is a bummer half man half horse or whatever he is with his dumb feet and  smells like smoke all the time pitchfork yeah every time i walk in with my crucifix he boos  i wonder if people think you know i think the cute movie's going to indoctrinate my five-year-old to be 
[00:45:30]  a lesbian or or treat homosexuality or bestiality in a light sort of way swanson said i wonder if the  average parent going to see frozen is thinking that way i wonder if they are just walking in and  saying yeah let's get my four-year-old and seven-year-old indoctrinated early you know i say  that oh no uncle paul you know they're not i think for the most part they're oblivious maybe they do  pick up on pieces of it but they just don't get up and walk out that's what there's some gay  undertones and that's turning uh i mean that's what they're saying turning uh kids into the gay 
[00:46:00]  lifestyle and bestiality yeah because the devil makes it you could say that about any cartoon if  you if that's the way you're interpreting things then perhaps you're the one with the problem well i  don't think so i think disney's put it out there to put it out there on purpose because they like  bestiality as well as homosexuality absolutely absolutely promoting it bugs bunny in a dress  that's true but we're wearing a dress right he looks good in a dress though what guy doesn't 
[00:46:30]  gusting himself  this guy's going to explain the gay agenda in disney i didn't know we had an expert on the line  love it hi guys how are you um i will in frozen the main character uh adele dazeem who  yeah you know let it go yeah she um the song uh it talks about how she's not going to hide  herself anymore how she's going to be herself and that can kind of be seen as a uh absolutely 
[00:47:00]  yeah if you're trying to assert and be who you are you're a queer this guy's a hundred percent right  uh i guess so i yeah one of the characters like pretty much you know stays in her room for a  for a really long time yeah yeah is that like being in that she finally i guess and then she  finally bursts out and says i'm gonna let it go oh boy right yeah her power power is very apparent  and so that's sort of like oh you're obviously gay in that undertone disney means gay we need gay 
[00:47:30]  dollars all right assholes are gonna stay open  yeah disney has a lot of things that can be seen uh from other uh musical movies that can be seen as  um a dual and uh embraced by the gay community as their song right i think they're fabulous  quite they are thank you guys love you guys okay of course you do and don't all disney movies yeah 
[00:48:00]  that's a very good uh point there they they promote bestiality like every one of them there's uh  i think there's one called beauty and the beast for the love of christ yeah you're talking about  that's right well love of the beast yeah that's the number one absolutely as far as uh bestiality  it's a little mermaid you bet it is half a fucking animal yep and that lower half is the fish parts  as it is all that mean where's the vagina yeah exactly if you got one leg one fishy leg where's the 
[00:48:30]  vagina exactly how do you pry that open exactly just gotta put it right in her little hiney  right in her mermaid shitter green green duty on your helmet  fucking fishy logs on you it's going under that when they sang under the sea they just meant the letter c  balls on your nose under the sea i'm under his sea  maybe uh people were onto him with the beauty and the beast and now it's like a little more subtle 
[00:49:00]  yeah yeah they had to back off a little bit let's go to doug in syracuse doug  yeah hi i just actually had to sit through that frozen movie like two days ago with my girlfriend  um no it's totally about lesbians oh yeah yeah completely it's just uh basically one girl's  journey into lesbianism it was hilarious wow good uh i i thought i was the only person who noticed  that until you like read about that guy the bestiality thing i don't know where the hell he's getting  that from but no it was just one big like i can do it on my own i don't need no man uh is there that 
[00:49:30]  subtle scene where she takes a knife and fork to the carpet and just starts eating it  why is she doing that exactly where she puts on a diving outfit and finds a muff yeah  very subtle yeah well all of a sudden she's stopping water from passing 
[00:50:00]  yes sir i guess it's uh i i i never see hidden meaning in anything right  i'm terrible movie i'd be horrible in those film classes where you're supposed to go oh that  represents that's why i am a face value motherfucker i never get poems do you ever get  poems no what's it trying to say he's saying that the roses are red and the violets are a different  color yes cares if the violets are blue oh sugar sweet uh doug you were talking about another song 
[00:50:30]  in my meat and frozen or there's a big the big song in the movies where the the main girl the princess  becomes all evil and magical and the whole stupid thing is basically her being like nothing bothers  me and i was like this is really gay it's the hidden track let's scissor till our clits fall off  they only eat at a clam bar they all go to the y 
[00:51:00]  yeah all right i i wouldn't have and the thing is i i will never see this movie  it's not a movie now i will it's not a movie that uh there are some movies that you'll see  even though you're not a parent no as far as animations go this one was it's it's well done  yeah but josh gad is hilarious the ones like like monsters inc is one that you could watch as an adult 
[00:51:30]  and be like all right that was pretty good right but this seems like princess fucking get the  foot i watched none of them like i'm not gonna watch rapunzel anything like that yeah but you  know the lion king i watched that cartoons yeah but you know better than going to a romance comedy  with the girlfriend that is sad oh good old rom-com standing back to back on the cover of the movie 
[00:52:00]  like what chariots of fire through the worst one of these and goddamn anything like getting those chick  just regular chick flicks just look all right buddy we're gonna move on uh re long island what's up  hey gentlemen how are you doing good well um that last caller was such an asshole i like that  um it's not really about that their sister she's trying to hide it but you know the original  thing i'm gonna make was um you know princess and the frog had two frogs in love with each other 
[00:52:30]  you have beauty and the beast you mentioned like even even sleeping beauty prince philip was  buddies with his horse so b-u-t-t-i-e-s but he's until the friends didn't uh hold the  cock back and he ripped his insides out exactly he was in seattle and he had a  perforated colon outside the emergency room around yeah  yes but to consider and to imply that elsa the princess is a lesbian is just ridiculous 
[00:53:00]  yeah all right guys have a great day i'll talk to you later all right they're trying a little  too hard there's a caller trying to indoctrinate more children absolutely john in staten island  has something on this john hey what's up guys hey man there's uh years and years ago my friend  showed me on the box set of the little mermaid if you take a look at the castle one of one of the  towers is drawing like a huge cock is a big what i remember yep it's uh well i instagrammed one

[00:54:00]  the one i instagram recently oh wow that's a big dick yeah he's holding his big dick he's holding his  big dick what is that i sent that picture privately huh and you know in the in the big rod on the  minister in little mermaid right oh yeah we've all seen them yeah that's done on purpose obviously  yeah you got some animators that are are a bit bored and they're kind of showing off for their friends 
[00:54:30]  like hey look what i put in knowing most people will never notice it until yeah until you know  social media took off and now you could waltz explore all this stuff he'd uh he'd draw the uh jewish  stars on the chests of uh cartoon jewish people and send them off walt was an anti-semit  certainly was i don't think they addressed that in the new tom hanks role do they no huh no it seems  to be a nice happy up movie they were trying to make there right but everyone knows that waltz was 
[00:55:00]  hoof boy did he have a dislike of the jews yes sirree bob they didn't even show him smoking in that movie  really yeah because disney's got a no smoking movies well it was a big oh my god it annoys me but  waltz was a huge smoker yeah god almighty and now disney is all about pole smoking well and animal  fucking don't ban that no smoking in movies no i mean but it's it's disney what do you expect 
[00:55:30]  i expect cigarettes in every cartoon let's go to laurie in new jersey hey guys how are you all right  what's going on much better now yeah oh god i'm so much better so listen i'm an english teacher and i'm  the mother yeah english what do you learn kids oh please so i have a 16 year old but i have a  three-year-old and a one-year-old and i've yeah i was a slut in high school no i'm kidding second 
[00:56:00]  marriage um so my issue is even with my 16 year old i hated those princess movies because i felt like  the message was always oh you gotta wait for your prince to come and everything will be better and  i like this movie because it's basically just empowering girls being like just do it on your  own day about it i really hate it yeah there is a difference between like it sounds like the movie's  message is that women can be independent uh-huh and a lot of dudes are like what is she a die she's a 
[00:56:30]  dyke then doesn't mean you're a lesbian so it's supposed to show that you don't necessarily need the  prince to ride in on the white horse and there now you do doesn't mean yeah but then we all know  that's the truth you could do it all on your own that's a complete fallacy yeah but then she's gonna  be then she's gonna be bossy though yeah she's we don't say that she's gonna be bossy the other  day that was the worst we were that bad this is coming from a woman who's always been told that she 
[00:57:00]  has a strong personality oh you're a bitch i'm a bitch then you're a bitch yeah yeah life goes on you  you guys are great i love you of course listening to you on the way home no your program director  needs to change things around oh yeah i think we're doing all right i hear you coming and going i  don't want to turn on another station oh we're we're we're fine for now whatever yeah thank you  i appreciate it all right let's say let's say hi to brandon in boston brandon yeah there's actually a

[01:10:00]  hi chris chris hi hey what's up boys what's up hi uh i just want to say um you know first time  caller but uh i've been listening to you guys for a while um like probably for like yeah probably for  like hours probably the first time i've heard you live you know on the phone here but um i just want  to say um you know you guys rock you know keep doing what you're doing and um i just want to say um  last i don't know if it was last week a couple weeks ago you had jim ross all right and i do and 
[01:10:30]  i mean i'm using on reddit and what i just found out that apparently wwe had uh some people on wwe  had not been happy about what he said about mr mcmahon like pretty much just shitting up on his pants  it's so weird we're taking your call because that's the the next thing we were going to get to yeah  i didn't know you were going to talk about but uh yeah supposedly the wwe uh reportedly upset with  the jim ross interview on opian anthony uh specifically the story about uh mr mcmahon 
[01:11:00]  sharting in his pants during a live taping crapping himself and so i guess the company  has fired back and they fired back on raw this past monday night right sam yeah well i think it was  actually i think it was actually the week before okay people are just now associating it with this but  we're making all the wrestling blogs yes people are connecting the two that i'm sorry sorry to  interrupt uh they actually uh when the one i read it they actually said that you know they put in the 
[01:11:30]  opening anthony show like they put it they put in your name oh yeah that's the headline i just read  wwe reportedly upset with jim ross opian anthony story how the company fired back on raw yes and we're  going to get into that in a second here yeah and i don't think i you know i heard i actually heard  the entire interview on opi's on youtube channel you know because that's the only way i can actually  keep up no that was yeah i don't put a i don't put full interviews up there yes it might have been  somebody else i don't think i got the i got the sharding story on i got the sharding story on my youtube 
[01:12:00]  channel but yeah okay yeah but then they use the parts from the space show columbia on space endeavor  i don't think i have enough bandwidth to put the whole jim ross interview on my youtube channel  man was that guy wordy no we like jim ross what am i doing all right chris i just want to say one  more thing just one more thing um there's a youtube channel called oh video ona i don't  know if you guys if you guys have seen it but one more i gotta give like props to that channel 
[01:12:30]  because that is the best channel to keep up with you that's how i've been keeping up with you  yeah everywhere yeah yeah video ona uh that youtube channel is great special endeavor yeah  that's kind of like the uh they they take our visuals and then you know they actually find the  visual and then i was talking about it and they put it all together nice and it comes out great oh  just one more thing one more one more thing yeah sorry about it all right thank you guys rock  all right i'm punching out thank you chris great job buddy robert christ from los angeles robert 
[01:13:00]  culp was one of the best uh columbo villains i was just watching one of those last night yeah god  damn that robert culp although he plays the same guy in every he's in like three columbos and it's the  same person like he's pretty much the same guy he's very he gets very agitated very quickly  i don't have time for this lieutenant back then if it worked they just kept doing it they just went  with it yeah that was great the first time do it again uh todd in jersey todd 
[01:13:30]  hey hey yeah so when jr was telling that story about vince shooting his pants yeah the best part  that he missed was uh after the show vince was chasing brisco around with his dirty underwear with  a tighty whitey chasing around backstage now uh you've wanted to say this many many times and we  never got to it so how do you know this i used to work at wwe i was actually training to be on  the road you know wwe right i actually used to sit next to jr and king ringside you know for uh four  years i was on the road wow wow so you're saying uh then vince ran around with his his shitty 
[01:14:00]  underpants i've actually heard that story too you have so so why are they upset that it finally came  out they're upset because number one this is a massive radio show that everybody's listening to right  now well that is true they don't like the fact that the story came out on a media destination  ah oh anthony and then oh and then because jr told this story on such a huge show right it ended 
[01:14:30]  up on tmc well i want to i want to thank the pr department the market department for pushing  the sharding story for oh that's right they didn't do that at all that was us that wasn't really the  market they didn't do anything to help it no you got a guy uh telling a story about vince mcmahon  who's a billionaire uh basically shitting himself it's a great story as jr said and we didn't even  liquid yeah when you think these guys would come down every once in a while and go but you know 
[01:15:00]  what that story today by jim ross i think we should try to push that out and work it a little bit why  are we always working these angles i guess we're smarter than them that's probably it that's what i  take home of myself for the only explanation yeah we gotta just be smarter so uh fill in the blanks  there sam so basically last week on raw out of nowhere jbl started talking about what a great  uh announcer vince mcmahon was oh because if you remember jr replaced vince mcmahon as an announcer  yes he did and then uh jerry lawler said well how would you convince how would you compare vince 
[01:15:30]  mcmahon to jim ross oh why would jerry lawler introduce that keep in mind jim ross hasn't been  an announcer for many many years and vince mcmahon even longer and uh jbl responded that  vince was better because vince could speak english implying that jr could not speak english and then  he said that comparing uh jim ross to vince mcmahon is like comparing horse manure to ice cream 
[01:16:00]  horse manure to ice cream which when questioned about the tweet about that uh jr tweeted that nobody  should be mad at jim ross and nobody should be mad at jbl michael cole or jerry lawler because they're  just following orders oh so the the basically the story that every new wrestling website is reporting  now oh really it's going everywhere every wrestling website has this up wow is that uh vince mcmahon was  in jbl's headphones and jerry lawler's headphones orchestrating the entire conversation right so he could 
[01:16:30]  get in a shot at jr on sure which wouldn't be the first time that he's gotten shots in it it makes  perfect sense yeah that's great good for us right and then yeah and you guys get attributed with it  so that is vince mcmahon i mean vince was was fun and all announcing but there's no way you beat oh my god  that's fantastic yeah ross was great we all know it don't get him in more trouble yeah oh that's true 
[01:17:00]  so weird vince is upset about it though he obviously had fun if he's running around with his  shitty underpants yeah god damn it that was private yeah he did that whole phase of kiss my  ass yep you know he likes a little ass play a little ass play i respect that but he likes to be in  control of it i'm sure he would be okay with coming on and telling the shark story yeah he doesn't want  jr to be going around and that's true that guy hasn't done our show in 15 years well he's a billionaire 
[01:17:30]  god damn it yeah but he was a billionaire when he was doing the show that is true he did our show a  bunch we had all the mcmahon's on yeah those were the shane that was the heyday stephanie stephanie uh  we have audio of her making fun of breast implants and we begged her never to do that remember she  sure and then she turned and turned around and did it she was very innocent uh girl at one point  and then she turned into you know that crazy wild the billionaire princess yep the billionaire 
[01:18:00]  princess my favorite was her chain to the furnace acting acting acting she was great can you get  that on that wwe uh i would think so probably could right well she was great i don't understand why  hollywood didn't come calling stephanie mcmahon there were a couple rules who kidnapped her the  undertaker of course the undertaker why would he kidnap her oh there she is she's acting 
[01:18:30]  i must address the mcmahon family we can't do this it's way too long it's way too long  look at her acting when she was attached to a crucifix yes oh there you got to get the one  paul bearer the one where she's chained to the boiler that was a good one in the basement she is  pinned down there and then she became like a a floozy i don't know well the power went to her head i 
[01:19:00]  guess was that after she was kidnapped how do you uh what's wrong jimmy's just like uh oh it was pretty  funny to watch back yeah that's true so i i kind of uh it was such a goof yeah it was hilarious and if  you saw two matches a night on those shows it was amazing because they went so storyline heavy  it didn't even matter the wrestling was a non-issue half of it was like skits that didn't even 
[01:19:30]  pertain to storylines it was just like look she's giving birth to a hand yeah yeah why not oh hell i  shit myself oh yeah i don't think you're gonna find a lot of material that's fine so he kidnapped  her the undertaker kid and uh where was that video of her being scared where was she she was in the  ring in the middle of the ring so no one called the police they just let the wrestler bring the  kidnapped victim exactly exactly was uh is the whole ministry of darkness kidnapping her so it was a lot 
[01:20:00]  for any police squad to handle what where where was vince why didn't vince come out and kick these  guys asses because it's his daughter well first of all that's the undertaker i think they were on the  outs right at that at that point i have no idea anymore it got very complicated cornball cornball  oh death music bong bong death my stomach hurt it's fighting brock lesnar 
[01:20:30]  the coffin here it comes very scary yeah oh boy you know this may be a good time to mention if anybody  wants to call in what from brooklyn brooklyn and they're in the area why brooklyn and the jesus we  got a pair of tickets to raw in brooklyn oh shit oh what is that it's on uh the 24th um busy oh this  month yeah march i can't make it so we got we got a pair of tickets but we if you went from outside the 
[01:21:00]  new york area you're out of luck as far as transportation and all that goes yeah i can't go  brooklyn okay we ain't gonna we ain't gonna drive you oh uh i've been um told look don't call unless  you could really go to this thing yeah and the call screener should just take a call from the  brooklyn area they should have to do something for it maybe no more trivia than sam that's not  gonna happen man no i ain't gonna have to be forgetting that the mastermind of the kidnapping 
[01:21:30]  was vince mcmahon himself right well that was that was revealed much later yes yes he was the higher  power after all yeah let's go to james in dc james uh good morning about 30 years ago letterman did a  bit on new year's eve where he had two wrestling announcers standing by hospital emergency rooms to  do uh a play-by-play of the first baby of the year one of them was like man and they totally imploded and  stuttered and ended up insulting letterman the other guy got smooth but the man just went off on 
[01:22:00]  letterman on the air yeah he's pissed he was pissed for real yeah he doesn't like making mistakes wait  i've never seen this clip it was about most of these clips i got to make believe i've never seen before  but this is truly one i've never seen before it was the nbc show about 30 years ago wow and it had to  do with the first baby of the new year and they had him dressed in tuxes in emergency rooms and the other  guy who i can't remember did it really speed he played it up as a satire like letterman wanted but 
[01:22:30]  mcmahon just from the beginning was uncomfortable and at the end ended up insulting letterman huh  trying to see what uh should we play this that's all about sure you know certainly a deluge of pregnant  women at this moment on their way down to the waiting room however uh we have been told by dr saxon that  there is a mrs fury it has about a thirty percent chance of delivering within the hour somewhat  long odds with me right now however uh john martino and uh john uh you came through but you

[01:36:30]  like if someone had a hammer and they're standing over your lifeless body me saying hit him more  would be incorrigible it's a little different slightly different if he didn't hit you and  started smirking at jimmy he'd be incorrigible exactly i'd make love to him yes  well i'm not going to condone the next uh phone call but we will take it uh oscar in texas oscar 
[01:37:00]  hey guys hey i had a pet rooster and uh it was attacking my wife and she kept telling me about  it and i told her she was full of shit until one day i was out there feeding him  and he attacked me while i turned around and i football kicked that motherfucker so goddamn hard  he broke his fucking neck so there ain't no way yeah when i was must have been nice  well if an animal is attacking you you strike back that's fair i don't know i think i think you're 
[01:37:30]  really crossing a line when you you decide to kill your family patch yeah i mean it's gotta be better  ways to deal with the situation yeah you hit me first you got your kids around and you're strangling  your own kitten your cat whatever your dog yeah that that was kind of bad on that deal because i had  to ring that rooster's neck because he's kind of half alive still and the fucking kids sing it on the  porch so it wasn't too good right i had to push bruiser out of the bedroom this morning so jess could sleep 
[01:38:00]  wow damn easy he took a swipe right at my achilles tendon he did the fact that you tolerate that from  your cat if my cat did that to me and clawed me one i'd pick him up by the scruff of his neck you  can't do that and say i will throw you through a window if you cut and he would listen no he wouldn't  yes he wouldn't be afraid of me just makes an aggressive cat no i don't know how to train yes i  i got a little story yesterday i was on the couch and i hear from upstairs this banging around sound  something falling i'm like ah you know beavis is at it so i go upstairs and i had left the windows open 
[01:38:30]  in the gym area uh because a nice breeze yesterday it was a nice uh nice day and uh beavis had gone  onto the windowsill pushed the screen out and was on the roof i then had to crawl out the window  and gather up little beavis from the roof of my house poorly behaved animal he is the worst behaved 
[01:39:00]  kitty but he's so curious he's so curious and inquisitive and adorable he climbed up on the roof he  was on the roof and i walked out on the roof and i'm just like come on because you don't want to scare  him and have him run off so just come on and he was good he came right yeah you've fallen off the  roof and ended up in the hospital because i had to go get my cat off the roof i was getting my cat  off the roof and i slipped and you broke both your legs you know how happy that would make me oh god  walking like jenny yeah exactly just lay there well the cat was probably just trying to hang himself 
[01:39:30]  like that fucking maid at damien's birthday party it's just for you anthony  i snapped my finger in his face went and then said no and put my finger how about water on him and  then yeah water works that work he went wow and then stopped you ever have good times with this cat  yeah he's he's adorable i would take a glass of water and fucking dump it right in his face for that 
[01:40:00]  wow you don't drench him he would almost feel like i waterboarded him you spritz him no you don't  spritz him you don't baby him i raised my hand to beavis he puts his ears flat back and lunges at  me whoa really oh yeah he's crazy it's like he knows you don't mean it right yeah he knows you're  a false flag but then he doesn't do anything once he does attack he'll grab you he'll grab you house  and then he won't do anything what a house of bluffing pussies  she would have the angriest most aggressive oh man no i wouldn't i've had cats i love them 
[01:40:30]  it would attack people one regret i had was when i was a young teenager i was drunk or whatever or  i was before i even drank i remember my cat john was in the basement like in the by the washer of  course you need to get john exactly and i was mad at him so i remember i took his nose and i put it  it right in my asshole and i farted on his nose i swear i'll never i'll never forget holding it  there and go what did he do pull it back so he didn't enjoy it no he didn't care for it at all 
[01:41:00]  jeez what a fucked up thing to do poor little kitty oh is that angry cat that'd be jim's cat  oh i can't see it very very angry cat attacks on youtube wow that thing is run off and  hide somewhere because jim kept picking him up and shaking oh wow that's what you would get  if you have cats at home turn this up it's always fun to watch your cat run around like a

[01:48:30]  whole bunch of people like that i don't even think there has been they just don't have a gig right i  love them right they don't have a gig and i always spend the money to get the picture it's just fun  you do i got larry hagman and a uh doing patrick duffy from dow i'm like yeah why not you got the  dallas people i did i enjoyed it hi larry big fan hi larry you don't have to sell us on the fact  that you went somewhere and took a bunch of pictures with some good point i'm saying like  all kidding aside guys yeah like like if you were the guy that never took pictures with celebrities  and you're like no i went to this comic-con it was really cool i took pictures with celebrities 
[01:49:00]  i actually never did take pictures with celebrities and there was a fucking turning  point yeah i met a celebrity and that's that's how it started by the way while we're talking about  social media there's a photo of uh roland looking upset on ona show on twitter uh-huh that we would  really like people to turn into a meme why oh because look at him he does look very mean so if you  go to ona show on twitter and you get the roland picture make it into a meme the best is e-rock with 
[01:49:30]  his fucking bob's big boy hairdo picking hopefully a bullet out of his ear  it's just so i love shot in the head jokes  i don't know maybe he's a big fat thick skull full of wax and whoever tried to do the show a  favorite mess that's absorbed all the energy so much cruelty in that one statement uh and don't 
[01:50:00]  forget about the opian anthony podcast right yeah really good reviews on this latest episode it's uh  snooping kids yeah kids going through their parents drawers and a little while they're while the parents  are at work a little nugget at the end too little nugget so go get it through itunes if you can  we would like it that way so we get some nice uh bragging rights if not just get the podcast

[01:51:30]  shit i'm going to rape you  fuck you run you fucking run yeah don't fucking stare at me you fucking bitch 
[01:52:00]  wow wow  terror officials looking into whether plane was diverted fox is really going with that angle  they certainly are that's the big uh that's the big story angle that's the one that would be like  whoa look out they would have to be very organized to get everyone's cell phones  i guess you could do that in flight well yeah gather everybody up i don't know 
[01:52:30]  but then there was a warning on the boeing 777  uh cracking and corrosion the fuselage skin which could lead to a rapid decompression and loss of  structural integrity on that plane or just 777s in general in general but fox is really going with  this terror angle was the plane you know diverted diverted well the extra flying time is weird right 
[01:53:00]  that's what it probably is wall street journal is reporting that it flew for an extra four hours wow  i guess that's a good thing i mean if it did unless they were all there was decompression but  yeah i just said nothing where's the plane where's the plane where the fuck are we up to six days  almost six days how would it decompress and the transponder not work and that's the weird part  and not be picked up by any military is that they may be wanting to use it for some later purpose down 
[01:53:30]  the road i mean it is an absolutely chilling uh report that is coming in uh from the wall street  journal from the opian anthony show uh of controversy that surrounds all of this this morning bill a lot  of questions out there today a lot of viewers right now are watching and wondering where are we let's  take a few steps back now late on friday night early saturday morning all right we're not gonna go  we're not gonna start from the beginning whole thing yeah we know so uh where are we well we would 
[01:54:00]  have purchased a ticket yeah uh yeah how about no no let's say hi to matt in jersey matt hey how's it  going guys maddie what's up uh i was wondering if you uh heard about uh also jimmy because i know he  doesn't smoke cigarettes anything but the uh tax that uh uh uh governor christie's putting up uh it's  going to be about 275 a pack for uh just regular cigarettes and the e-cigarettes uh which a store i  own in uh greenbrook it's called mad vapes they're going to pose a tax that's going to make a little 
[01:54:30]  30 milliliter bottle of flavor that goes with the e-cigarettes for about a hundred dollars now and it  cost about 10 bucks that we sell them they're going to put us out of business well it's disgusting the  attack on the e-cigarettes regular cigarettes i have less mercy for but the e-cigarette attack  well the big boy is sickening are the big boys involved with the e-cigarettes is that the problem  yeah they are i mean no i don't know are all the big tobacco companies uh making an e-cigarette at 
[01:55:00]  this point well what they're doing right now is this you know have you heard of the little blue  cigarettes you see on the commercial they needed the money yeah yes yeah they uh they're they're  sponsoring those right now and putting those out but they don't do anything people come in our store  and throw them out because the batteries don't last long they don't give you they're not the the puff  they get them are so little and we have you know the variable volts with change that put the the  vape up and there's no smoke out of them so they're little blue cigarettes they do nothing how dare the 
[01:55:30]  government interfere with that like that's where like and and that you can't smoke in publicly in  the parks how dare the government well it might encourage i don't give a if it encourages young  people right it's a freak society well how about you give smokers a break on that one like how about  you tell fat people you can't eat uh diet food in public because it looks like you're eating  fattening food which is bad for young people to see yeah yeah they wouldn't dare do that bloomberg  might have yeah he probably would have went down that road are the e-cigarette i mean it can't be 
[01:56:00]  healthy to do the e-cigarette honestly no it's um i'm not thinking it's healthy it's not bad for the  rest of us probably not as bad as cigarettes right technically can't say it's healthy even though it is a  healthier um it's a healthier alternative but who knows what's in that in that stuff yeah yeah  hell but it's no one's business though right it's no one's business it's vegetable glycerin that's  mostly in the liquid liquid that we use and that's in everyday foods right yeah but you don't put if  you put broccoli in your lungs it's not going to be good either again i don't care about people's 
[01:56:30]  lungs i care about does it affect the people around you and if it doesn't it's nobody's business  people just don't like the way it looks because it looks like people are smoking too bad whether  whether it's healthy or not i mean it's your choice i don't give a shit if they want to smoke  a cigarette or not if they want to vape i don't care i mean it's just we're promoting i mean this  is my friend and i's business and it's literally going to shut down we did this and we i just heard  about this tax and it's just going to put me you know my whole career and life out of when 
[01:57:00]  when is this i'll say vape again when is this going down it's supposed to be proposed in uh 2015.  yeah man and that's your boy it back down christy is that my my boy is what happened  all right buddy i don't know what to tell you no i just want to you know no one knows about it we  tell the smokers and i called up our legislators in uh in our state and county they don't even know  about it no one even knows and i'm just trying to spread awareness you know and try to get more 
[01:57:30]  opinions on it because right there you go you did that today so good luck to you matt thank you buddy  maddie it is to the point when you see someone smoking on the streets yeah it seems so strange  looks a little odd right isn't it yeah that's that is going away man you do kind of feel like what are  you doing why would you do that it's uh it's it's just a dangerous thing to do to yourself 
[01:58:00]  i don't care though i think people should be allowed to but i like that it's not in bars i like that  i like not in public places really because that was getting a little out of hand exactly  go home just that heaviness the reeking you just reek you wake up coughing you can't talk yeah  definitely yeah well we got a woman pleading guilty to post the nude photos of her husband's  girlfriend what and then she goes outside how'd that happen and then something else happens uh-oh 
[01:58:30]  and we're gonna play that for you right now please do let's do this  and a one green and a two and a three i'm not hearing any thing  um uh-oh what's the matter sam that's fine find it somewhere else i'm i'll take this call  because this guy knows exactly what happens to that plane oh clay what's up what's up 
[01:59:00]  what's up hello he's in there he's in the plane plane what's up it's under water sharing any  clay um uh-oh what's the matter sam i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm gonna i'll take this call  this idiot 
[01:59:30]  the hell clay he screwed guy from california missing flight plane had a wing rip ripped off it was  repaired and put back into service or it had a rip in it you clay now he's an idiot he has nobody's  talking he's a dummy i'll tell you why he doesn't even work a phone it wouldn't keep flying if the  wing came off well not came off it says that that plane had a wing rip it was repaired and put back  into service maybe rip and bong hits well well let's say uh hi to remy then remy help us out here 
[02:00:00]  the reason why state legislators are trying to do the back door  bullshit with outlawing vaporizes because the ones you put your own liquid in people are putting hash  oil and they're walking around smoking pot without anybody noticing but again too bad here's why i say  too bad then ban rolling papers then ban pipes you can't ban what is i think a legal product if it's  not affecting other people right and we're about to legalize uh marijuana anyway across the country 
[02:00:30]  right yeah yeah she was legal chiba talk with the young people oh everyone is watching colorado very  closely yeah seeing what happens over there a few more states are going to legalize marijuana by the  end of the year just for the tax money alone oh yeah so i don't know how good a stoned populace would  be but i guess whoever would smoke is smoking now anyway yeah so it doesn't really matter i'm sure it'll 
[02:01:00]  turn right i'm sure it'll turn people on to it it's like drinking same thing drinking is way worse than  possible drink and i i mean it's like law wise you know just because it's legal doesn't mean everyone's  getting hammered and plowing into things all right right so pot's the same thing all right we'll go  back to this lady so she's got nude photos of her husband's girlfriend and then she walks outside  and then this happened come on hey just let it go she grabs the reporter's mic yeah she's got her purse 
[02:01:30]  and she smacks it oh man is that the girlfriend or the wife it's the wife that's the wife oh what a  bitch she is she does not want to be bothered by the press  what who's saying this security cameraman i'm saying if you touch the camera again you'll be under 
[02:02:00]  arrest really they're shoving the cameras in her face you're ridiculous okay yeah you  that's the wife yeah you're right so what they're coming out of court or what are they coming out of  the courtroom right and what what was the back story what did the wife do she posted nude photos of her  husband's girl is that the husband or something else it's somebody else i think it was outside and 
[02:02:30]  hits a reporter in the face well for being in her face i i kind of get the wife like she's being  humiliated like this and and this guy's around on her other poor is right in front of her she can't  even walk around him that's great right slammed i'm always happy when a reporter gets hit in the  face even if he's right i don't know she seems like a problem i'm sure she's a cunt yeah she looks a  little cunty a little bossy yeah a little bossy i'd say wow we don't do bossy and bossy sorry beyonce 
[02:03:00]  love you miss you thank you screw her too as her husband continues talking about bitches and hoes  yeah yeah nigga this nigga that right of course but we'll listen to you beyonce bossy bossy's uh  too far right no one has the courage to you know take it that direction one of her big songs right  now like the the big surfboard surfboard it's not surfboard no it's bow down bitches bow down

[02:12:30]  there yeah all right let's uh start uh what are some celebrities that she's enjoyed oh the cock of  i'm not a celebrity why would they put jimmy well the first one that uh rings a bell is j phoenix  which i'm assuming joaquin that's what it sounds like to me oh man he's got that little trough for  for the vag juices to drip down his cleft palate trough so he never has to take a breath 
[02:13:00]  uh i don't know lucas haas i don't know oh that's that uh kid he was a kid at once  no he was in um in mars attacks okay he was the younger brother of jack black  all right in mars attacks he was in uh one of those inspirational movies like rudy but not rudy  right you know kind of one of those well he's early on the list whatevs who else is on the list nico 
[02:13:30]  tortorella nope don't know oh my mother made some tortorella it was marvelous this sauce  she filled it with nico from the home country  nico it's a leaf that grows so is that it yes soaked in uh vendetta blood  evan peters i don't know no evan peters then we get into some more familiar names wilmer valderrama  that one's documented yeah uh jamie burke jamie burke i don't know jamie dornan yep 
[02:14:00]  zach efron whoa she fucked zach efron that's what the list says watch it be these are people she wants to  what the fuck oh man uh justin timberlake is on the list colin farrow oh wow is on the list as is  heath ledger the late heath ledger it doesn't say if it was before or after true uh  ryan rot rotman roman i don't know wait wait no um it's not gosling

[02:15:00]  the teen nick series gigantic nice you know what that's referring to we sure do sam  his cock yeah i was thinking the same thing  what's your night cup i'm doing something chip max george who's that i don't know guy berryman  mm-hmm who's that james apparently an undertaker 
[02:15:30]  oh boy  that was bad james franco wow  adam levine whoa oh my goodness and garrett  had a lean don't i was hoping not to hear maurice exactly who cares who's this pig  fucked i didn't give a fuck well exactly jimmy how's this big i don't care 
[02:16:00]  why is it a big story on one of the gossip sites i'm so not interested in who she's opened her freckled  legs no i don't care the takeaways are joaquin phoenix zach efron justin timberlake colin farrell  meaningless i wish it was ted bundy or fucking jeffrey dahmer james franco and adam levine  those are the big fucking names right there oh big whoop jesus she's uh quite the little hollywood  whore supposedly well it's gonna be in touch magazine yeah i guess in touch got their little hands 
[02:16:30]  who knows but who knows if that's what the list is why would she just write a list out right you  know how girls talk yeah but i don't believe the article that's the actual list that's the picture of  the list so right but it doesn't say that nobody knows for sure right you know i would doubt it  lizzie lohan's too smart for that she knows everyone wants to know no no but she knows everybody wants  her so she probably put that dumb list out and there's probably some other reason yeah and then 
[02:17:00]  she'll just make a fool out of everybody by saying what the why would she make a list of  guys she's leaving on the bar according to the magazine source lindsay was giggling and talking  shit about people in the industry uh the trouble starlet then apparently wrote down a list of her  numerous lovers it was her personal conquest list she was trying to impress her friends with the list  and then tossed it aside yeah then why not just tell them the devil came out yes fuck yeah excuse me 
[02:17:30]  why not just tell her friends why would she write it down lizzie lohan is not known for having great  judgment no no no i know but it's like saying why would she's too smart to drink and drive because  she knows that she's always getting in trouble no but this is a little bit this is almost too obvious  poor decision making is kind of her thing it's too obvious i would like seeing like  fucking tin tin what about steve-o yeah again the horse from that warhorse movie it's another  celebrity yeah exactly uh oh god uh uh seed biscuit 
[02:18:00]  tillicum that's the killer whale she's jerked him off once jacked him off in a big tank he rolled over on  his back just snuck in tugs peter let's say hi to andrew in jersey andrew and drew hey i'm calling  bullshit on this list because uh none of our co-stars are on it and you know like especially when you're  young you're gonna around people that you're going to work with you know didn't she bang steve-o too 
[02:18:30]  did she bang steve-o i think these are guys she wants to bang she dated wilmer valderrama oh did she  yeah so maybe she mixed it in yeah i mean there's some people there that she dated so i mean anybody could  have put together this list you know but like i would assume she could these guys yeah i'm not  heath ledger you don't think she could have heath ledger i think she could have heath ledger  now no not now passed away they both look like they're decomposing horrible she's she's not as 
[02:19:00]  attractive as she was back in the mean girls days oh god no she was how old then i don't know 18.  yeah but she's teenage yeah she's still very young she she looks like for her age oh she does horrible  all right andrew thank you ridden hard and put up with i'd love to sleep with her i think she's sexy  but yeah why not and why does the list uh leak right when the own series starts exactly anyone watching  that thing did start up yet yeah it's kind of boring oh it is you've watched mm-hmm why is it boring 
[02:19:30]  because not much is going on she's in her like hotel room all the time being like uh i can't  believe the paparazzi around song oh i have zero interest in her i don't care what she does yeah  like if she's doing a movie good do the movie i'll look at naked pictures of her but who wouldn't  well of course other than that that's what i'm saying really i'm not a christian  sam what's going on with the bird man oh god the bird man i want to i want to check out the bird man  i thought this was funny when are we going to talk about little people big worlds well i'm
