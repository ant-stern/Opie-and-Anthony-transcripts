<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of the hosts' experience witnessing President Obama's motorcade and subsequent appearance on *The View*.  They described the extensive security measures, the sheer scale of the motorcade, and the resulting disruption to Manhattan traffic.  Viewer-submitted videos of the motorcade were shown and discussed, prompting conversation about racial dynamics in the reactions of onlookers. Opie claimed to have received a wave from Obama himself during a previous encounter. The hosts speculated on Obama's motivations for appearing on *The View*, anticipating potential clashes with Elizabeth Hasselbeck, and touched upon current political issues like unemployment and the national debt.  Anthony then showcased security camera footage of his neighbor damaging a bush, which was analyzed with caller input.  A caller who worked on Marine One helicopter parts detailed the rigorous maintenance procedures and the use of terms like "Jesus pin" and "Jesus nut" for critical components.  A retired NYPD officer offered insights into presidential security protocols, discussing past assassination attempts and the evolution of security measures.  Further caller anecdotes detailed their experiences with presidential security details, ranging from driving in motorcades to tailoring suits for Secret Service agents. One caller recounted a humorous incident and subsequent disciplinary action involving a joke about Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky.


The show then transitioned to a heated exchange with Sandy Cain, a previous guest, who had left her hat at the studio.  This escalated into angry phone calls and death threats from Cain, prompting discussion of contacting her lawyer and potentially filing a police report.  Earl Douglas, author of the self-published photo book "Black Rock Volume 1," was interviewed.  Opie and Anthony playfully teased Douglas about the book's low sales (around 20 copies since February) and his marketing strategy. Douglas discussed his reasons for self-publishing via Blurb.com, the Black Rock Coalition, and the representation of Black artists in rock music.  The conversation included banter about a rat infestation in lower Manhattan and a questionable news report about a suspicious car on the Throgs Neck Bridge.  A subsequent call with Earl involved further joking about his book sales, his views on the age of the Earth and evolution, and a demonstration of his unsuccessful telemarketing sales pitch.  Comedian Bob Kelly then joined the show, discussing his upcoming performances and hecklers, prompting the playing of a *Louie* clip.  This led to a vulgar and offensive exchange between Anthony and a female caller filled with insults and rape jokes.


The show continued with more discussion about the age of the Earth, referencing Sherry Shepard's views, and a crude discussion about aging female anatomy, including attempts to find online images of older women engaging in sexual activity.  A segment on "Monsters Inside" detailed graphic descriptions of parasitic infections, including botflies in a man's head and a worm extracted from a man's anus. A high school senior's unusual medical situation was briefly mentioned but left unresolved.  The discussion of parasites continued with a caller, Mallory, describing her acanthamoeba keratitis.  Further discussion of "Monsters Inside" and its graphic depictions of parasitic infestations followed, including playing a listener's audio recording detailing a botfly larva extraction. Dr. Steve, a guest, provided commentary on parasites. Numerous listener calls detailed other parasitic infections and their removal. Multiple obscene voicemail messages from Mel Gibson, directed at a woman, were played, followed by a seemingly apologetic final message. The hosts speculated on Gibson's state of mind.  Sam, a show intern, revealed that two callers to the Ron and Fez show were actually the same person, intern Derek, who was lying to get back on the air.


The final segment focused on intern Derek's deception in calling the Ron and Fez show under fake names.  The hosts interrogated Derek and fellow intern Love Buzz, who claimed Derek had threatened his life.  The conversation spiraled into bizarre and sexually charged tangents, including Derek's attempts to manipulate the Ron and Fez show, his past lies (including about being mugged),  graphic descriptions of sexual habits and fantasies by the hosts and interns, and references to other radio personalities.  CokeLogic, a YouTube animator, commented.  New Girl, a female intern from the Ron and Fez show, joined the conversation via phone.  The segment concluded with announcements of upcoming guests and shows, with significant profanity and crude humor throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:00:30]  A box of chocolates that Forrest's mother was talking about.  You're a no-good son of a bitch, Bob.  You motherfucking-up.  We're so much fucking better than you.  Absolute lunacy.  If you're giving me the hook, fine, whatever.  What's going on?  I do what I'm told.  Completely out of control.  It doesn't get better than this.  Come on.  It's shocking.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's do this.  Morning.  Hello. 
[00:01:00]  Hello, hello.  Hey, we didn't get a hello out of you.  Good morning.  We didn't get a harumph out of you.  Yeah, I know.  That's the line.  Harumph.  Harumph.  Hey, everybody.  Oh, I got your text.  I'm the dummy, Jimmy.  Oh, I did get your text.  Oh, I did get a hoax out of you.  Oh, I did get a hoax out of you.  Me and Jimmy were looky-loos yesterday after the show.  Yes.  Looky-loos.  We were the looky-loos.  The view is from three and four blocks from where we live. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  So we, oh, text me.  We said we were going to meet and go down and see the president.  Yeah.  Go in.  It's just kind of cool to check out the whole thing because they pretty much freeze.  I want to say the whole city, but they freeze, I don't even know, how many blocks?  It had to be at least ten blocks and then at least three or four going the other way.  That is a massive area in Manhattan to freeze just to get the president into the view. 
[00:02:00]  And me and Jimmy are sitting there and we're trying to guess where the motorcade's going to go.  We guessed horribly wrong.  Yeah.  And actually, I was on the scene before Jimmy and I started seeing the white shirts, NYPD guys.  Those are the sergeants and all, right?  The lieutenants and all.  The captains, yeah.  The big wigs.  The big wigs.  And all of a sudden I see them gathering on like two blocks away, but you can see from our vantage point this area.  I'm like, fuck, we guessed wrong.  And then they froze everything down so you can't even move. 
[00:02:30]  You're not even allowed to move.  If you move, they look at you like, why are you moving?  I'm like, I don't know why I'm moving.  And then from a distance, we saw his motorcade pull up to the view to get in.  But before he arrived, what was amazing, and I haven't seen this before, they brought in the sanitation fucking dump trucks.  Yeah.  Those heavy motherfucking trucks you see in Grand Theft Auto.  They made a barricade.  The barricade, they were filled with sand.  And they started putting those in position everywhere. 
[00:03:00]  So, like Jimmy said, probably a suicide bomber or something.  Oh, yeah.  To stop suicide bombers.  You know, a car with a bunch of explosions.  Yeah.  Or a machine gun.  Like, anything that you could fire rapidly at the vehicle as it was slowing down to get into the building.  It was unbelievable.  These things were put in place, and you knew they meant business.  They were shutting down all sorts of crosswalks.  It was something to watch, though, man. 
[00:03:30]  I saw Bush's motorcade, and they always go the wrong way.  Like, I saw Bush's motorcade going north on...  Isn't that the right way, though, as far as they're concerned?  Oh, yeah.  Going the wrong way is the right way.  Watching 50 cars go north on Broadway was weird by Caroline's.  So, what they do is they came down 65th the wrong way.  But, see, when I got down there, I was thinking that. 
[00:04:00]  I'm like, okay, he can't go...  This is how stupid I am.  I go, he can't go that way, because that's a one-way.  Yeah, he's going to have to adhere to it.  But this is my logic.  I'm like, okay, that's a one-way.  So, obviously, the motorcade's not going to come down the one-way to drop him off at the view.  So, I think this is going to be the spot on 66th, because it's going the right way for traffic.  What an idiot.  As we see, not only the presidential limo, two presidential limos,  we see probably 50 to 60 cars going the wrong way in the motorcade to drop him off. 
[00:04:30]  It's impressive.  Posse.  It's impressive.  If you've never seen a presidential motorcade, I didn't get as close as Ope, but I saw it from a block away.  Well, that's the second part of the story.  Yeah.  I mean, you get chills.  You really do, because you're like, the amount of force, the amount of motorcycle cops that just started off,  and then just, I don't know, man.  You can't even describe everything that goes flying through.  It's just the guys that we, it's, it's, it's. 
[00:05:00]  Vans and, and SUVs and ambulances.  Ice cream trucks.  Yeah, exactly.  It really is.  Just dumb things where you're looking like, what the fuck?  Kool-Aid ran through.  It's literally anything you could possibly need, he has.  He's like, and he's the most protected guy of all the presidents.  Just like, you know, because he's black, and he's wearing a war, and he's, you know.  Yeah.  Yes.  But it's very impressive.  If you've never seen them shut down the fucking, an area that he's going to show up at, 
[00:05:30]  you're like, well, it must be great to be him.  Not as, not impressive for the people stuck in traffic.  I, I kind of like, did some HD flip with the people stuck in traffic.  It didn't come out that great, so I'm not going to post it.  But people just fucking pissed off.  Yeah.  I don't doubt that.  I was an Obama fan until today, until he made me sit in traffic for over an hour.  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  Those zones that were frozen, they don't reopen at all until he's done.  Yep.  That's exactly what happened.  You'd think they would open all the streets because he's going to be in there an hour or 
[00:06:00]  whatever it was.  Actually, he was in there a long time, because then Jimmy and I gave up.  We're like, I ain't fucking standing here for an hour just to watch him leave again from  a distance at this point.  Yeah.  I go back up to my apartment.  I'm looking out the window about an hour later.  I see all the snipers on the rooftops.  I'm like, this is some serious fucking business, man.  Yeah.  And then the helicopter was kind of hanging out in the area a little bit, taking a look.  I go, you know what?  I'm going back down there.  And then I looped around to where he came in, and I was front row for the exit of Obama's 
[00:06:30]  motorcade.  Oh, yeah.  And I got that on my fucking HD flip, and I posted that.  I wish I would have seen that.  It is cool to watch, man.  They're all fucking zipping by.  It's like, God damn.  Yeah.  What a fucking, what a bad dude.  Any president is just a bad fucking dude, man.  No stopping for lights.  That's great.  They don't stop for it.  They don't sit there going, come on.  Move.  Yeah.  And whether you like him or hate him, a few people said that on the comment section.  It's just impressive to fucking see. 
[00:07:00]  You're like, wow.  All for one lousy guy.  I know.  In the end, he's just a guy.  He's a man like you.  I'm just a man.  But.  My name's Obama.  We were looky-loos yesterday.  It was fun.  I mean, because I was in my apartment, right?  And I had to do a phone call for something.  And I'm like, I'm tired, man.  I'm like, what are you doing?  The president's going to be four blocks from your house, you cunt.  Take a peek.  Go look. 
[00:07:30]  Take a peek.  I was glad I did.  You just look to see how it all develops.  You see how the blocks around our place just shut down.  Unbelievable.  Blocks that had nothing to do with it.  Spinners on his SUV?  Spinners?  No?  Not like that?  That's funny.  I love the spinners.  You can tell it's his.  Because he's black.  In my one video, people just lose their fucking minds.  They're fucking losing their minds.  Like black people? 
[00:08:00]  Well, it's classic.  On the one video, I got this black guy just waving really weird, really excited.  But then I pan, and you see a bunch of white people fucking cheering, too.  But then again, it's that time of the day when everybody should be working.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I saw the part of the video where the one black guy was like, here comes the man.  Here comes the man.  Here comes the man.  Here comes the man.  Yeah. 
[00:08:30]  That's great.  So.  I got to see the president there.  How many presidents does that make for you?  I've seen.  Well, I've had a picture with President Clinton.  Right.  You saw Bush.  Just me, Clinton, and somebody else, whatever, that got cropped out.  Just whatever.  You saw Bush in Philly, right?  No, I saw Bush in Arizona with Rich Voss.  Right, right, right.  Okay.  With the Secret Service that were fans of our show and Rich Voss.  That's when Rich Voss had some heat. 
[00:09:00]  I forgot the name of the hotel.  We were in Arizona.  I was staying at the same hotel as Bush.  I only saw his motorcade.  I didn't see him.  I'm like, well, I saw him actually walk into his presidential limousine.  I did see that.  So this is three for me, I guess, sort of.  Damn.  And Obama waved right at me yesterday.  Oh, did he?  I'm starting to think we do have a chance of that friendship.  You see a mouth out.  Opie!  Love the show. 
[00:09:30]  Would you be embarrassed if Obama had rolled his window down and just yelled Baba Booey at you?  Asshole.  Fuck you.  What did he talk about on The View?  Anyone know?  They're saying he...  Fluff shit?  No, he said...  Elizabeth Hasselbeck might have asked him a couple of tough questions or some tough question about jobs. 
[00:10:00]  Called her a cunt, right?  Yeah, he dropped the C-bomb and everybody laughed.  You cunt.  Asked her to suck his cock.  Did Hasselbeck get into it with him or what?  I doubt she got into it with him, but she asked him why.  I don't think anybody would.  She's pretty brave when he's not there.  Let's go.  He's right there.  Let's go.  Get into it with him a little bit.  Huh?  So are we.  We're brave when people aren't here.  We do.  I think our fucking batting average is pretty damn good, actually.  I disagree with people who say that he shouldn't have done a talk show. 
[00:10:30]  I think he should have.  Why not?  I mean, it's no reason to not...  It reaches a lot of people.  Why can't he do it?  Like, all that does is say that the news and Dan Rather, or any of these guys who are actually active...  It's like, why should they get the exclusives to talking to these guys about things and not have them talk to...  Fuck them.  I just know his whole motivation here is trying to appeal to people during the midterm elections so he doesn't get wiped out.  The Democrats don't just get wiped out. 
[00:11:00]  But I think it's too little too late to tell you the truth.  Yep.  Unemployment rampant.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Deficit, sky high, government spending and fucking intrusion in our little lives.  Worse than ever.  Thank you.  Thank you, Obama.  Glad you saw his motorcade, though.  That's good.  I don't care.  Did he smack into a pothole?  Those fucking... 
[00:11:30]  The potholes that aren't getting fixed?  Yeah.  Because there's no money left?  Our city decided not to fix potholes this year in New York City.  That's really smart.  And then Mayor Bloomberg will just ignore the fact and make believe that the roads are fine out there.  Everything's fine for him.  People are losing chunks of their cars in New York City this year.  Our road is...  I don't even know if it's a paved road officially anymore.  Yeah.  There are so many potholes going up our road toward Broadway.  My lease is up in like two months on my Escalade, and I had to buy a new tire and rim. 
[00:12:00]  Really?  Yeah.  I give it back to him with a brand new tire and rim because I hit a pothole, and it just laid open the rim.  Jesus.  And the tire.  And I didn't even know I drove for a week with that thing just ready to explode.  I didn't know.  I looked one day.  I was like, oh, that's the damage it did.  Yikes.  Oops.  Yeah.  Hey, you know, getting back to that dumb video for a second.  Why are people idiots at making those jokes? 
[00:12:30]  Those jokes.  I'm scared to even say it.  You know.  They can say it.  Oh, my God.  You know, those jokes?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Are you stupid?  That's like making the...  People are stupid.  It's like making those jokes at the airport and...  Right.  Certain places that get you in trouble.  And then there's a few people already saying they're reporting them to the FBI because then  you get Obama fans checking out this dumb little stupid video I made.  Never say shit like that.  It's not an award-winning video, but people are on there making those jokes.  I'm like, are you insane?  Yeah, there are some things you just don't say. 
[00:13:00]  Right.  For fear of a visit.  Right.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Whether you're just joking or not doesn't matter to them.  I'm trying to help you out.  Don't make those jokes, idiot.  Mm-hmm.  Not smart.  Apparently, it's funny, though.  Snooki came up.  Some question.  He's like, I don't know who that person is.  But he's already used her as a punchline.  Yeah.  He used to cast his punchline before.  He's got to know who's...  Oh, I'm sure.  He might have been joking when he said that. 
[00:13:30]  Why do they always say, I don't know who that is, or I don't know that, or...  Because he might have been joking.  I didn't see the context.  Yeah.  Yeah, he might have been kidding, going, I don't know who that is.  Like, I don't know.  Oh, okay.  I honestly don't know.  Did he call her a fat pig?  Yeah, he said something about a Tasmanian devil, and she's got a body like SpongeBob SquarePants,  and he didn't want to fuck her.  He was trying to keep it, you know.  Wouldn't that be great if he slipped and said that?  Like, oh, I'd hate to fuck her.  Whoops.  Oh, well.  Can we cut that out?  That one's so rule. 
[00:14:00]  Ant's got a good video, too.  Oh, yeah, that's a fun one.  Actually, you've got a really good video.  Yeah, I came out of my house yesterday morning, and I look, and there's a giant bush, one of  my nice landscaped front yard, and one of these bushes next to my driveway.  Anyway, it's in the middle of my driveway. 
[00:14:30]  And I come out, and I'm looking, and I go, what the fuck is that?  And then I finally figured it out.  Melinda came over with her sister Jan and the boys, and they went swimming and everything,  because they used to pull and stuff.  And then when she's leaving, she completely wiped out one of my hedges, one of my little  bushes there that are on the side of the driveway.  And she insisted, no, couldn't be me.  Check the security camera. 
[00:15:00]  So I checked the security camera, and she completely wiped this bush out.  She's trying to get, now, I had the Escalade parked behind her, but I've done this maneuver  before with a Mustang.  You can't swing out immediately.  You've got to kind of swing a little, give yourself some room, and then leave.  So as you see, she starts pulling out, and nothing's amiss.  Although if you look close, you can now see a streak from where her tire was to the car.  And then up, thud, thud, she runs it over, backs out, and nary a second, and look. 
[00:15:30]  There's the bush.  Very large bush is now in the middle of your driveway.  As she merrily drives away.  It looks like her car's shit.  Yeah, yeah.  That's funny.  Car took a shit.  That's great.  It just merrily, she pulls it, doesn't even see it.  And that's how I found, when I walked out that morning, that's what I saw.  And I'd look and go, what the fuck is this?  That's funny.  So I posted a little of the security cam footage, and it's just hysterical. 
[00:16:00]  What a great camera that is.  She was laughing.  Yeah, and people are like, what did you go with the time-lapse camera for?  It's like, I didn't go to the time-lapse.  I sped up the video a little bit, because she wasn't moving that fast, and I didn't want  it to drag so long.  So it sped up a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  So it looks like it skips, but no, that's smooth as silk when I look at it on the security  cam.  But yeah.  So basically, it took her forever to get out of your driveway.  It took her forever, yeah, yeah. 
[00:16:30]  I didn't even know this was sped up until you just said that.  This is sped up four times.  Get the fuck out.  It's four times speed.  So she's pulling out really, really slow.  Slow, and still just completely took out a chunk of bush right there on there.  And then look, thud.  Her car, I said-  You see the car go thud, thud.  Her car goes up in the air when you run over the plan.  She goes, I didn't feel it.  Do you think she felt it?  I just didn't know what it was.  It was embarrassed?  She said she thought she hit the curb, because if you look, when she hits it at one point, 
[00:17:00]  her back wheel hits the Belgian block on the side of the driveway right there.  She hits the Belgian block, and I think she thought that's what it was.  You're analyzing this like it's the Zapruder film.  Oh, I know.  I was.  I watched it 50 times, because I was laughing so hard watching it.  How did she wipe that out?  See, she went back and to the left.  Back and to the left.  Back and to the left.  People want to comment on your video.  Who's this, brother?  It's Joe.  Hey, Joe.  What's up?  Hey, Joe.  I watched the video, and like Ann said, when she hit the curb, I thought she blew out her 
[00:17:30]  tire backing up, and then she pulled forward again, and just, the hedge just pops up in  the middle of the picture.  Hilarious.  Yeah, because if you're watching it, you're like, oh, well, when does this happen?  Yeah.  Like, I don't see anything.  And then you realize it happened already, and she backs out and just leaves this giant  hedge in the middle of my driveway.  And not, she doesn't give a second glance. 
[00:18:00]  She must have been looking out the rearview mirror over her shoulder or something to back  out the driveway, and never looked forward.  Maybe you could just plant a hedge there, so you'd know it's going to be a hedge.  Yeah, some people said it really added character to the driveway, and that I should leave it  there.  It does look good.  In the middle of the driveway.  Yeah.  Let the hedge blossom.  Yeah, that's great.  All right, brother.  Let's say hi to Nick in Wyoming.  Nick.  Yeah, it looked like a little Hitler mustache in the driveway after it was all over. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I watched the video, too.  And I'm watching the thing, and I'm saying, what the hell is she doing?  I didn't know which way was out of the driveway, because she's going back and forth, back and  forth.  And then all of a sudden, the little bush is there, all alone, in the middle of the driveway.  And I'm like, that is too friggin' funny, man.  Yeah.  She should have gone a little bit to the driveway.  The driver's side first, to the left, and kind of give herself a little more room, because 
[00:19:00]  that's what I've done.  I would have never tried to just cut the wheels completely to the left and then back out and  try to swing around my car.  If you watch the video, there really isn't that much room.  So, I don't know.  She was in a hurry, I guess.  No, she wasn't, because she drove really, really slow to get out.  She was laughing more than anybody, because she texted me yesterday when I posted it.  And she was just laughing, like, holy shit, did I get creamed? 
[00:19:30]  Oh, very good.  Let's say, how did this, this, why aren't there any names on the phone thing today?  Who's this brother?  Hello?  Yeah, you.  Len in New York, guys.  What's up, Len?  So, Opie, you watched the motorcade and got the chills and all that?  How about Yankee World Series right after 9-11 when George Bush was throwing out the  first pitch?  Mm-hmm.  That was a big one. 
[00:20:00]  Three Air Force One helicopters come in, so they don't know which one he's in.  Right.  And Bush gets trotted out there with a huge vest on, and you look up in the lights at  Yankee Stadium, and there's 20 snipers with rifles pointed at the fans at Yankee Stadium  looking to see if anybody is about to toss or do or anything.  Could you imagine what that would be like?  Hey, wait, did they, did they, I'm sorry, did they helicopter him right onto the field  or right outside the stadium?  No, right outside the stadium where the old bat used to be.  Right.  They just had three copters come in after all the fans were inside, and, yeah, and when 
[00:20:30]  he walked out there and stood on the mound, you want to talk about chills, it was, it was  like three weeks after 9-11, so everybody was all just, it was electricity.  I saw Marine One come in once, and they got, like, three other helicopters  surrounding it, and then they got, like, two, they got two, I guess Marine One and Marine  Two.  Two, right.  So you don't even know which helicopter he's in.  And I think when they take off in D.C., they, they, they, they, like, you see the president 
[00:21:00]  boarding a helicopter, three of them take off, and they do some weird pattern, like, they  come up from behind trees, and they do some weird pattern.  Oh, they do the shell game.  They do, it's exactly what it is.  They do the shell game.  It is a shell game.  In the air, to go, wait a minute, I don't know which helicopter he's in anymore.  The snipers in the black uniforms and the lights were, I guess, comforting and disturbing  at the same time.  Yeah.  How was security getting into the game?  Was that a nightmare?  You know, it was, it was, like, every single bag, every single pocket, it was, it took an 
[00:21:30]  hour and a half to get to the Dern South.  You know what, I think we all experienced, a lot of us experienced this yesterday with  Obama in New York City.  I think we're at a point where the president just shouldn't be traveling anymore.  Yeah.  It just shuts down way too much shit.  That's all I could think of yesterday was get the fuck out of New York City.  Yeah, I wish I got a better video, but people were really fucking annoyed.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, there's stories of people taking two hours to get home when it takes 
[00:22:00]  a half hour.  Or everyone, so many people are inconvenienced because he's taken a...  Manhattan, or if you've lived in Manhattan for any length of time, like the UN visits  whenever the president...  Oh.  Well, that's, that's a nightmare too, but I mean...  You just gotta be smart and just say, I'm not going there today.  I mean, the amount of stuff that Jimmy and I saw have shut down just so we could get  to ABC Studios to do The View yesterday, it's not worth it anymore.  No.  I mean, there's businesses all along the route that are suffering.  People can't use those roadways, so they're just bottlenecked everywhere else. 
[00:22:30]  And then they freeze everything down for an hour and a half, so you can't move at all  as a pedestrian or a car.  It's not worth it.  He went to Jersey to talk about small businesses and how he's helping small business.  And he made believe he just walked into the small business when the reality was everything  in that area was shut down for miles.  And one guy that's right across from the sandwich shop he went to was saying, so he's coming here  to talk about helping small business.  And he goes, he completely shut down my business for the day. 
[00:23:00]  No one could come in and do business with me.  That guy's just jealous that Obama wasn't going to his business.  Going to his place.  But this is happening every time Obama visits anywhere, you know?  Yeah.  I wonder how much that hour at The View cost us tax-wise, Anthony.  Well, Jimmy, what do you think?  I couldn't even count that high as far as how many cops I saw.  It's a good amount of money, but...  I couldn't even tell you.  I stopped counting.  I did start counting, and I'm like, this is unbelievable how many cops are here.  And dude, this is for one moment of his day. 
[00:23:30]  Right.  But it's expensive to the taxpayers, but again, with any president, you're going to have it,  and it's a necessary expense.  To me, that's not a waste.  You have to do that to protect it.  He's probably the most targetable guy, especially where we're in a war, so Islamic extremists  hate him.  Yeah.  He's the biggest target in the world.  He has to be.  My point, I agree with you.  You have to protect the president like they're protecting him.  I'm not saying they shouldn't be doing all those measures, but it's getting to the point 
[00:24:00]  where it's not worth it.  You know what I mean?  Oh, financially?  Yeah, for everybody.  A lot of people were inconvenienced yesterday.  I mean, there was a time the president would just kind of sort of walk around with a lot  less of that shit, and I'm sure it was worth it.  Shake some hands, the famous shake some hands, kiss some babies.  That shit doesn't happen anymore.  No.  You know?  Isn't the view like a PR move anyway?  Of course.  It's not like negotiating people.  No, he's half black.  Dealing with the economy and all that.  Yeah, but he's also talking to the people, too. 
[00:24:30]  And it's in the country's best interest, whether he's vacationing or campaigning or doing official  business to not have the president be killed on duty.  Look what Kennedy's being killed did to the country.  It's fucking horrible.  This is way too local, but for Obama to go to the view, his route, they shut down 65, Jimmy,  all the way through the park.  Wow.  You know that route, too.  I think they do.  Because when he was done, then he could shoot right through to go over to the east side for 
[00:25:00]  whatever he was doing.  I don't know if he was leaving from the east side or had other stuff to do.  He had a party to go to.  Right.  But you can't shut down 65 through the park.  That road is needed by a lot of fucking people.  It's just amazing to me that they do that.  And then they shut it down.  One-way street.  That's the other way now.  Right.  Of course.  Let's say hi to Darren in West Virginia.  What's up?  Imagine one do-gooder cop just ticketing the whole motorcade. 
[00:25:30]  Nope.  This is a one-way.  I don't care.  Ah, you're going the wrong way.  No exception.  Actually, it would probably be one of those big, fat traffic people.  You know what?  I got on video, though.  Next time I get caught for any kind of traffic stop, I'm like, really?  Well, let me show you what happened one day here in the city.  Above the law, Izzy?  Yeah.  Darren, go ahead.  Hey, fellas.  What's going on today?  Jimmy, love you, buddy.  Thanks, man.  Obama came to Charleston, West Virginia for Robert C. Byrd's funeral. 
[00:26:00]  Sure.  And it completely shut down half of the state.  They shut down three major interstates.  There were, I don't know, 15 planes.  Clinton was here.  Half of the cabinet members were here.  Yeah.  It was the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen in my life.  Well, that's for a funeral for a guy that did a lot of time for this country.  Oh, absolutely.  So I think, I guess what I'm trying to say is you've got to pick and choose at this point because it's just not worth it to keep shutting everything down as he's moving around. 
[00:26:30]  And the vice president gets close to that treatment.  Really?  Sure.  Not maybe as much, but I would say Biden probably gets the same treatment.  He's second in line.  Speaker of the House probably gets a certain amount of it.  But, you know, there's a lot of dignitaries that get whatever, you know, the Iranian president's in.  He doesn't get quite that much, but he gets enough.  Right.  They can't afford to have him killed here.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say hi to Kevin in Connecticut.  Kevin.  Good morning, guys.  Hello.  Wait, you're the, this is what you do for a living?  Yeah.  This is Kevin from Connecticut. 
[00:27:00]  We know him very well on the show.  What's up, Kevin?  I checked the Blackhawk helicopter parts for the company I work for.  Friday, my boss comes to me.  He goes, listen, we have these parts.  They have to be checked.  Marine One is grounded, waiting for this part.  So, long story short, I check it.  They ship it up.  And this is the one that eventually took Obama up to the view.  So.  Wow.  What was the part?  Wow.  It was a liner.  And the kicker, I rejected it.  A liner?  What's a liner? 
[00:27:30]  A double-threaded liner.  I rejected it.  And they just, they bought it and said, okay, that's good.  So, there you go.  What's a liner?  I don't know.  It was just a hunk of steel with threads on both ends.  Okay.  Hey, does Blackhawk have a Jesus pin?  It has a Jesus ring.  Yeah.  It doesn't have a Jesus pin like the Hueys did?  It might have it in the gun mount assembly, but.  One fucking pin that holds the whole fucking rotor on.  That's why they call it a Jesus pin?  Yeah, because if it fails, you're going to see Jesus. 
[00:28:00]  Really?  Yeah.  One fucking pin?  You're dead.  Yeah.  I'm sure they do.  There was one pin in a Huey that would hold the rotor assembly onto the shaft that.  No shit.  Yeah.  And if that pin goes, you're seeing Jesus.  We have a Jesus ring, and the only reason it's called that is because the foreman got  the print for the first time, and he goes, Jesus, look at all the dimensions.  Right.  Oh, okay.  We got a Jesus ring.  All right, Kevin.  Thank you, sir. 
[00:28:30]  Hey, guys.  Here's a guy, Brian in North Carolina.  We have a lot of fans that kind of work around the president.  It's really strange.  We met the Secret Service guys in Arizona that time, me and Voss.  They were huge fans of the show.  Huge.  Secret Service.  Not huge enough to get us a little closer to check out W.  No.  Well, that's their job.  Just to keep you riff-raff away.  Shock jock?  Come on.  Brian in North Carolina.  Can't be trusted.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey. 
[00:29:00]  Hey, usually that means go.  Yeah, that usually means let her rip.  I used to work for HMX, a squadron that transports the helicopter.  You know HMX, Ant?  No.  What is it?  What is it?  DMX.  You got to dumb it down a little bit, sir.  What are you talking about?  Marine One is a Marine helicopter maintained by Marines, and I'm a – well, I was a Marine,  and I used to work on a HMX-1 Marine One. 
[00:29:30]  So you used to work on the presidential copter?  Yeah.  Yeah?  What'd you do?  Oil up the fucking bearings?  I was avionics.  Oh, so you were instrumentation and shit?  Yeah.  Oh, that's cool.  Take something out and pop it back in.  The H-60 has a Jesus nut.  A Jesus nut?  Yeah.  That's just some scary shit.  Is that a Jesus nut right there?  That's a Jesus nut?  Yeah.  If that goes, you see Jesus.  But you look at that.  How would that ever go? 
[00:30:00]  Oh, you'd be surprised.  But how would that ever go?  A stress crack right there where the hole is drilled through?  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, it's scary stuff.  And there's no backup?  No.  There's nothing.  Hey, wait.  Maybe you can ask this question.  Yes, Jimmy.  When Sam and I were on the deck of the Midway, we saw one of those helicopters that has two  rotary rotor blade sets.  The old Sikorsky fucking...  And I think Obama's marine helicopters have two sets of blades. 
[00:30:30]  The rotors, yeah, yeah.  How do they not hit each other?  Those are like three.  One set is higher than the other.  It is higher.  I thought so.  Yeah, the back is higher.  They used to call that the flying banana.  Dumb Sam said that they were probably, they were synced up in a way, so the blades would  spin and just, I'm like, shut up.  But he meant it.  They weren't.  Yeah, the rear rotor is higher than the front one.  Okay.  They still use those.  Can one fly, can the helicopter fly with... 
[00:31:00]  No.  Oh, they need both?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They need both.  Need both.  The other one is spinning.  It keeps it from torquing around.  It doesn't need a tail rotor when you got two rotors like that.  And you get a lot more lift, but...  You do?  Yeah.  One goes, oof, oof.  That's a pretty dangerous way for him to travel.  He probably doesn't travel great distances like that, but...  It's usually just take him from, yeah, wherever he is real quick to Air Force One.  A little hop.  How is a presidential helicopter never... 
[00:31:30]  I mean, they're maintained so well, but...  That's what it is.  It's maintenance and a great crew.  It's just...  That's what it is.  And the fact that he can fly anywhere he wants and they clear the fucking air of anything else.  It would have to...  You'd have to really fuck something up to have one of those go down.  No, but like you said, like a stress fracture.  One of those little things that happens internally to a...  When they made the nut in the factory, something that the naked eye won't catch because it's right under the surface.  Like, something stupid like that. 
[00:32:00]  And every part is tested.  That's happened.  That's happened before the CH-53 echo.  That's also...  Well, you're going to have to Google that shit.  I'm not going to explain it to you.  It's a very boring radio.  But that happens a lot.  Well, not a lot, but it's happened in the past and it's probably going to happen in the future.  It just happens.  I saw a show that every couple of years they just rip apart airliners and just take gut the fucking thing and go through it with these stress analyzers to see if the skin of the plane is getting any stress fractures, any of the structural parts of the plane. 
[00:32:30]  I mean, the seats, everything gets ripped out.  The wiring, and then they just replace it all.  They do this every few years on Emirates Airlines.  Why don't we get that when we're flying into Des Moines, Iowa?  Yeah.  Why don't we get that?  The whole shit on those planes.  We get the shaky planes.  Shaky planes.  Everything's shaking.  You're just opening a lamp.  Yeah. 
[00:33:00]  I don't like looking...  Nothing worse than a loud noise coming from your plane.  I don't like looking at the window and it looks like it's cracked.  Right.  Like one of those things.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I like the look of that.  We assume way too much.  You assume...  Someone must have checked that out.  I guess someone looked and said it's okay.  Is he being sucked out like Goldfinger?  Yeah.  Let's go to Elio.  I guess.  Elio, New York.  What's up, buddy? 
[00:33:30]  Hey, how you doing?  Long time left, sir.  First time we were able to be down to...  All right.  What do you got, Elio?  All right.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  I always love your shows up on Bananas.  I'm at Poughkeepsie.  I'll come back.  Thank you, sir.  I've been listening to you guys for years, and today was like a sore subject because now  we got that Chelsea Clinton marriage that's coming up.  Now, I live real close to Rhinebeck, New York.  I live in the Poughkeepsie area.  And usually I ride around on my motorcycle, you know, and take a look at the different  views.  Secret Service is just making freaking just big hats with all the small little things. 
[00:34:00]  And I was just riding there just yesterday, and they're looking at me funny like I'm  some type of freaking terrorist.  And between him, between Chelsea Clinton, and when Cheney was vice president, he used  to come up to Poughkeepsie.  I mean, they just make a mess of things up here, and I don't understand why they decide  out of all the places out of the United States to come up to our little rural town.  How far is Rhinebeck from the city?  It's about approximately about maybe 80 miles or so. 
[00:34:30]  I don't know why they do it, but I mean, there really is no solution to it.  It's an annoyance, but what do you, it's a president or the, I mean, it's Clinton's  the ex-president, and his wife is the current secretary of state.  Yeah.  You have to, what are you going to do, three cops guard them?  I want them protected.  Mall security guards.  But like I said earlier, it's getting to the point, it's not worth it.  I mean, when the president flies into JFK, they shut the route from JFK all the way into 
[00:35:00]  Manhattan.  They shut it down.  Yep.  The entire road.  They have to...  You know what that does for the average person trying to do his work?  In the olden days, they just fucking went around in a limo.  Right.  Yeah, whatever.  They had the guys on the side of the limo just hoping.  Yeah, we saw how that worked out.  I understand.  Wave, wave, wife picking brains off a fucking hood.  Like we discussed yesterday, that's when it all changed, obviously.  Before that, they didn't shut down miles around the president.  They shut down maybe a block or two. 
[00:35:30]  On the back of a train.  And I intend on helping this country through a most difficult time.  On the back of a train.  Choo, choo.  Oh, no.  It's choo, choo.  Oh, choo, choo.  I mean...  A little pathetic choo, choo.  Because they see the thing...  Oh, God.  There's like so many roads around in the area.  I mean, like, you know, Rhinebeck's like a two-cow town there.  So when they start blocking out these major roads, people don't really got nowhere to go.  Hillary and who else? 
[00:36:00]  You know, it's just...  Two-cow towns.  I'm a big fan-ankled bitch.  You got to figure.  You got to figure.  You know, it's like these guys can go somewhere else.  I mean, they got the money.  I mean, why don't they go to like some type of large, established area instead of coming to these small little rural areas?  But I think the answer is very easy.  They kind of live up in that area now.  And she's having a wedding.  I know they don't live in Rhinebeck.  I don't know where it is based on where she wants it, not where it might inconvenience people in a town.  There's some guy on a motorcycle who might get pissed.  Yeah. 
[00:36:30]  Well, it's more than that because, you know...  Actually, they picked a good area because Rhinebeck isn't a very populated area.  Well, the only reason...  Like, we're happy it's not in Manhattan.  That's what we're saying.  It fucks you, so we don't care.  Fuck Rhinebeck.  Well, no, we'll figure it this way also.  Because, you know, these guys, the only reason why she's having this...  This gala of hers...  Is it because she's in love?  No, not because she's in love.  Because, you know, Clinton, you know, Hillary Clinton, was our senator for so many years, 
[00:37:00]  which I didn't vote for her because I'm a Republican.  I like my guns.  I have lots of guns.  Let me know when he's done.  Yeah.  So what are you talking about?  You're really going on a...  You're making a real...  You're off-roading a lot.  Yeah, and...  And...  Hello?  And...  Elio!  Yes, I'm still here.  Oh.  All right.  What are you saying?  She's getting married.  There's going to be security.  What do you want?  No, I don't want anything.  I'm just saying.  I'm stating a fact. 
[00:37:30]  You know, basically, you know, the only reason why she's having her wedding up there is because...  All right.  Hillary was our senator, and she pretty much visits throughout the whole state.  All right.  And I guess this is like an offshoot town in order for her to have her wedding, because  it's quaint.  It's nice.  Oh, okay.  And, you know, that's the point of getting...  Oh, you're saying that she probably discovered this little quaint town while she was senator  and fell in love with it.  Exactly.  Okay.  All right, guys.  All right, either.  I'll punch it out.  Thank you.  All right.  Then again, Clinton, who knows?  Fucking Bill Clinton may have dropped a load there on the campaign trail in 88. 
[00:38:00]  I'm just like Chelsea, too.  I'm just like Chelsea, and, you know, when I got married in Philly, man, I shut down,  I think, half a block.  Oh, yeah.  That'll happen.  It was crazy, man.  You gotta watch that.  Philly was shut down when I got married.  It really was.  Remember those little rickety buses we took from the hotel?  It's horrifying.  Hey, the Globe is saying that Bill Clinton, right on the cover, hot off the presses.  Now, is the Globe one of these rags that we trust?  No.  It's garbage.  What?  The Globe turned into the Weekly World News. 
[00:38:30]  Which is the one we trust, then?  The Inquirer and the Star.  Oh, so Globe we don't trust.  Oh, all right.  Globe should be having a bat boy.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  But some of these rags we do trust, but the Globe, no.  The Globe is saying right on the front page today, Bill Clinton, six months to live.  Ravaged by heart disease, fighting Parkinson's.  Is he fighting Parkinson's?  What?  Does he have the early stages of Parkinson's?  I hope not.  Well, the Globe is saying it.  Wow.  And finally, he won't see his first grandchild. 
[00:39:00]  And won't is in another color and large font.  They really want you to.  Wow.  He won't see his first grandchild.  What do you think?  That's a bold statement.  What do you think?  I don't know.  He looks pretty good.  He gets around.  I miss Clinton.  Do you really?  Yeah.  He was kind of fun to have around in that White House.  Who was your favorite president?  Reagan?  Yeah.  I liked Reagan. 
[00:39:30]  Reagan was great.  Which is very surprising, because I don't really lean Republican.  Reagan ruled.  I kind of liked Reagan when I was growing up.  Reagan was a different type of Republican back then.  I liked Reagan, and I liked Clinton.  I think that's about it.  I like Clinton.  I think that's about it.  I didn't like Carter.  No.  I didn't like the Bushes.  You didn't like the first George?  And Obama.  I mean, that's been blown out of proportion.  I'm not a big, huge fan of Obama.  My whole thought on the Obama thing was that I knew he was going to be elected way before  others.  Yeah.  People laughed at me.  He said, there's no fucking way this guy's going to be president. 
[00:40:00]  But you just felt it, that America was going to do this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it doesn't mean I'm a rah-rah Obama supporter.  Well, we'll see what happens in 2012.  Sarah Palin?  No.  Republicans throw her in there.  They deserve to lose again.  Well, the media is giving her a lot of fucking power, man.  Well.  A lot of fucking power, man.  She sells books.  She gets ratings on Fox News.  You know. 
[00:40:30]  With that whole thing with that voice, I just can't seem to take it.  In the end, she's a joke, isn't she?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's not presidential timber.  I don't see it.  Nope.  We've got to get, you know, start floating some names out there.  I almost had a great picture yesterday, but I was too scared to take it.  I was walking back.  I forgot to tell Jimmy this.  I was walking back to our building after the whole Obama motorcade thing and the snipers. 
[00:41:00]  But I don't think they were Secret Service snipers.  They were breaking down their weapons.  Oh, yeah.  Into the big fucking gun cases and shit right on the sidewalk.  Nice.  Just breaking down.  There were so many guns.  And I lifted up my HD flip and the guy looked at me like, you don't want to do that.  Don't.  And I just like, the look he gave me, I just knew, why don't you just fucking keep walking?  Like, I could put this together pretty quickly again.  But he was taking parts and putting it in the big fucking gun case. 
[00:41:30]  You should have said to him, what are you looking at, Flatfoot?  I'm doing some filming.  Flatfoot.  That sounds like Danny in my kitchen last night.  What happened?  Danny's no obsession.  Trying to get his fucking AR-15 ripped apart and put back together in under a minute.  Yeah, I got to beat that little girl on YouTube.  Yeah.  She's too good.  The YouTube girl is hysterical.  What's she, 11?  And she could fucking break down a gun or put it back together?  And she could break it down and put it back together in like under a minute, 50 some odd seconds. 
[00:42:00]  I think it's about 53 seconds.  Yeah.  And then you read the comments and there's some people like, well, whatever.  She didn't even do this or that.  She's like, look, you do it.  There she is.  Look how adorable.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  She is cranking this thing apart. 
[00:42:30]  Although I did get some nice tips by watching this.  By watching this, yeah, yeah.  A part in 15 seconds.  Coming back together.  A part in 15 seconds.  I like the fact that she puts her hands up.  Yeah, she puts her hands up like that, done.  There's no way this is 53 seconds.  She took a lot of time with that one section right there.  Yeah, she gets going pretty quick.  She's a very bad girl.  She gets it back together pretty quick.  She gets those pins in.  She's got the little fingers.  I like that move. 
[00:43:00]  That snap move is the move.  I got that one down now.  You got it down, the snap move?  That's pretty good.  Be great if you just shot the guy holding the camera.  Spring.  Get in there.  Fucking lower on the upper.  And rack it.  53 seconds with function check.  Look how happy she is.  Yay!  I should be playing with dolls.  Why do I have an asshole for a dad?  My dad wanted a boy.  She was so happy.  She did it in under a minute. 
[00:43:30]  That's great.  Yay!  I should have an easy bake oven.  Why am I holding this machine gun, asshole?  Daddy so wanted a fucking son, man.  That's pretty impressive, though.  That's cooler than doing a dumb Rubik's Cube.  Yeah, it is.  Trying to figure that shit out.  The little pins are the hardest part.  Getting the pins out.  Hey, you want to talk about...  We got a retired NYPD guy on the line here.  Charlie, Staten Island.  Charlie!  What's up, Charlie? 
[00:44:00]  Well, then Jimmy was asking about the difference between the presidential and the vice presidential detail.  The presidential detail is total lockdown.  The vice presidential detail is done with 12 motorcycles and two cars from the NYPD, and they shut the road down on the fly.  Oh, that's it?  Okay.  So, yeah, but who gives a shit about the vice president?  In the end, you don't really give a crap about him.  Well, he's not the target, either.  Yeah.  I want to know...  Give me more details of what went on here yesterday, being a retired NYPD. 
[00:44:30]  I mean, the freezing everything up, how many roads are blocked.  A lot of overtime is what went on.  The whole route is blocked.  He comes into Kennedy on Air Force One.  Right.  He takes Marine One from Kennedy to a location close to where he's going, either downtown heliport or the west side heliport, depending on where it is.  Okay.  When he hits the ground, it goes into lockdown.  They lock it down until he gets into the secure area, wherever he's going to, and then they open the route up. 
[00:45:00]  Same thing going out the back.  They usually come the same route, going in and going back out.  Sometimes they differentiate.  Right.  He goes back to the heliport.  Then he gets on Marine One.  He goes to Kennedy.  Our people don't leave until he's wheels up in Air Force One in the air.  Yeah, but I'm more talking about, like, the roads and how they're shut down.  They shut them down.  They put a police car at every intersection, and then the major intersections, which are close to the location where he's going to be, they'll put the heavy trucks. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, the sanitation trucks we saw.  You commented about how many cars are on the motorcade.  The majority of that is press.  And they have NYPD, they have a lead car with Secret Service.  They also have what they call a cat car, which is a catastrophic action car.  In that cat car are five to six Secret Service agents with fully automatic machine guns. 
[00:46:00]  I did one of my last details with the U.N. General Assembly, and we did the Prime Minister of China.  We brought him in from Kennedy to New York.  He stayed for a week.  We took him around wherever he had to go.  When we were introduced to our Secret Service team, one of the Secret Service agents, a good old boy from central United States, came up to us, praised us on how we did our job, how we did our roads.  And the only thing that he could tell us is, please, if there's a threat to the principal, don't come towards it, because I have to kill you. 
[00:46:30]  Jesus.  Amazing.  The only people that, everyone is a threat except for the principal.  So anybody who comes towards him, if something happens, dies.  Wow, that sounds nice.  That's basically what they do.  That's protection.  If you're on the motorcade, if you're on the motorcade, you see those black Suburbans?  Yeah.  If someone jumps out, jumps over the rail, and stands in the street, they'll run you over and kill you. 
[00:47:00]  Well, I'm so glad.  I'm so glad.  Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.  No questions asked, and then they just leave and go about their business.  Just leave you there dead.  Yeah, I'm glad Jimmy didn't take my $100 bet yesterday, then.  Oh, but give me $100 if I just ran towards the president waving, flailing.  Oh, God.  You probably wouldn't be shot, but you would be taken down so quickly.  They would take you down.  They would take you down hard.  They would take you down hard in the street. 
[00:47:30]  They would make it hurt.  Wham, your face would be right in the street.  You don't know.  If you were running towards the president, though, you don't know if they wouldn't shoot you,  because they don't know if you have a bomb strapped to you.  You don't know if some cop's going to tackle you.  They'd probably actually tase you.  Tase you?  They'd tackle you?  Secret Service is going to kill you, Jimmy.  Secret Service will, but I mean a cop if you're just running.  Well, if you're getting that close, it's going to be Secret Service.  Yeah, that's true.  So what if a dummy just gets a little too excited and jumps out?  He's a dead dummy.  I think they make a quick snap.  But the thing is, like with Oswald shooting Kennedy, it's like, it's not like you don't, 
[00:48:00]  they have to lock everything down because you're not just looking for this gigantic plot.  Like sometimes it's just a fucking guy in a window.  It's like they have to be suspicious of every person.  Well, Jimmy, they have advanced teams that come in and go to certain locations.  They do vanish points.  They have an idea of where something might happen from.  You see the snipers on the roof.  They're looking for certain places where they think a threat will come from.  You know, you can almost say that no one could kill the president. 
[00:48:30]  It may happen, but it's a very, very hard thing to do.  Yeah, I mean, I'm sure it's possible, but it seems like it would be a very difficult thing.  If history has taught us anything.  Yeah.  Anything is possible, but for it to happen, it has to be something that's, you know, totally out of the realm.  Now, with every attempt, something else is learned.  That's what happens.  I mean, you know, what was the last one really, Reagan? 
[00:49:00]  Reagan, was that really the last major attempt that really almost got pulled off?  And things were learned from that, too.  Mr. Reagan, Mr. Reagan.  Did he yell Reagan?  Yes.  Pop, pop.  Oh, they had him against the wall in a second.  Second.  Remember the guns they were able to fucking take out of their suits?  The guns that came flying out of everyone's suit.  How the fuck are you hiding that?  I remember that.  There was one guy, I don't even remember what he had. 
[00:49:30]  I think a couple of them were carrying Uzis and shit, but they pulled these things out,  and it was like, where the fuck was that?  You're wearing a well-fitted suit.  Right.  Where the fuck did you hide that?  Hey, wait, now the, when Obama's in one of the cars, right, how many, he's with agents,  I'm sure his aides and his, you know, Pete, his advisors, but the agents are in the  trucks behind him and ahead of him?  Yes.  And also NYPD also has a cat car that's a little further back in the motorcade. 
[00:50:00]  But in the lead car, which is an NYPD car, there's Secret Service personnel, then there's  the wedge of motorcycles which surround the president, and then there's, you know, there's  tail cars that shut the route off from behind.  But yeah, in his, in the passenger seat of the limousine at Secret Service, probably with  a machine gun, and you know, all around him, he's surrounded.  You won't be able to get to him.  So, uh, do you, uh, are they no-nonsense guys, the Secret Service guys? 
[00:50:30]  Of course.  Yes, they are no-nonsense.  Yes, they are no-nonsense.  Little nonsense every now and then.  A bit of nonsense.  Just a tad bit.  Are you thinking you could reason with them a little bit, Jimmy?  Yeah, come on, I just want to talk to them.  Get a picture.  I'm a taxpayer.  So, um, you know what, one of the videos I made yesterday, you could hear Jimmy getting  so annoyed that, that the motorcade wasn't driving right by us.  Did I get annoyed?  Oh my god, you're, you're on, you're on video of, yeah, you're getting very annoyed.  Like, of course, he's going that way. 
[00:51:00]  Uh, continue, Charlie, this is pretty good shit.  Wait, yeah, now let me ask you something, Charlie.  When those, when the Secret Service advance team, like, say, 20 minutes before he arrives,  and they, we saw all the white shirts kind of gathered like a half circle, the, the high  up cops, those guys are mostly like lieutenants, and, you know, a lot of that is probably  to keep order, and some might be just for show.  So, but are the Secret Service guys kind of telling them what to do?  For the most part, yes.  Um, they, they set up the security and things like that, and what happens is NYPD does the, 
[00:51:30]  the outside security.  Um, the locations inside is done by the Secret Service.  NYPD handles the crowd, NYPD handles the traffic, and they handle, um, outside perimeter security,  and the Secret Service handles everything else once you get into the location.  We'll try to notify you before we commandeer your men.  Who's in charge here?  I am.  Not anymore.  That's basically what it is.  I love those scenes in movies.  That is the most cliche. 
[00:52:00]  The feds show up to the scene.  It's like, not anymore, and the local guy's just like, ah, man.  Ah, well, eh, the feds are here, I'm done.  This is my investigation.  You mean it was your investigation?  How many, uh, guys from the NYPD would you guess for, for the president?  There, there are probably thousands on that detail.  Wow.  Oh, man.  That's what I'm talking about.  That's not worth it anymore.  Probably two to three thousand cops.  Two to three thousand, just to get them to the view.  No.  I, I, I, Jimmy, I looked all the way down the one road, and there was, like he's saying, 
[00:52:30]  a cop car and a, and a few cops on each corner.  Yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  Everybody who was off was working all the time, and everybody who didn't have a, you  know, a thing to do, or a desk job, or something like that, or a detective bureau, they were  there in uniform working.  You know, it's funny.  I knew, uh, a guy named Ken, who, uh, he was a Marine, I believe.  Oh, right.  And I think I met him, I'm trying to think if I met him in Iraq or in Cuba. 
[00:53:00]  I met him in one of the two, I was doing gigs in both, and he was, uh, at one point,  he worked in the White House.  He was one of the Marines, and, uh, he was going to get me a tour of the West Wing, but  you needed, like, six months, or a few months' advance security clearance to get the tour.  Oh, yeah, check your ass right out.  Yeah, he told me, um, a lot about the process, I just don't remember.  Because he would see the president all the time.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, he was one of the guys that was, he was one of the guys that would salute at  the helicopter, like that type of guy. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  So I just offered nothing, basically.  Thank you, Charlie.  Charlie, you got anything else that's good?  Nah, that's about it, Opie.  I just want to say, um, you know, it was a pleasure to do that.  It, you know, when you, you're in the, you're in the motorcade, you're on a motorcycle, and  you look right to the right of you, you're in the, um, you're in the wedge, and there's  the president sitting next to you, and he kind of looks over to you, and you look over  to him.  That's probably one of the greatest feelings in the world.  Like you said, you're just standing on the corner, and they ride by, which is a great  feeling.  But that, to be part of that is, is, you know, something that you'll remember for 
[00:54:00]  the rest of your life.  Yeah, I don't think you forget that one.  Did you ever get to meet, to meet one of the presidents, or no?  No, not at all.  I, I was only in the unit from, from 2001 to when I retired in 2006.  So, once 9-11 came, security things changed a lot.  I know earlier, a lot of the guys, um, especially the vice president, stuff like that, they used  to take pictures, they used to, uh, you know, were able to talk to them, things like that.  But after 9-11, a lot of things have changed. 
[00:54:30]  Right.  All right.  Hey, Charlie, great phone call.  Thank you.  Take care, man.  Anytime, you guys.  You guys are the best.  All right.  Well, next time the president comes around.  Yeah.  You'll be the expert.  Okay, thank you.  All right, Charlie.  Matt in New York, you were asking about how they pull the, the, the weapons out of the  suits in.  Yeah.  Especially, we saw it during the Reagan attempted assassination.  Yeah.  Matt's got an answer for you.  Matt in New York.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing today?  All right, man.  Hey, I was in, uh, Korea.  I was in, uh, Army Aviation for nine years as a, as an officer.  And I was in the tailor shop in Korea when I, when Gore came over to visit us. 
[00:55:00]  And the secret service guys were in there.  And, uh, despite all of them being just like huge guys anyway, they brought all their equipment  in primary radios, second radios, shotguns that they hang from their arms, whatever their,  whatever their desire to be set up with, whatever they wanted.  They put it all on.  And then the tailor measures them and fills the suit around how they want to carry all  their equipment. 
[00:55:30]  Great.  And they still look fitted, like you were saying.  Look all nice.  Right on.  Uh, Kenny, what do you got?  I have a presidential story.  Oh.  Club Soda Kenny.  Yeah.  I was assigned once to a presidential detail for Bill Clinton.  And, uh, you know, before we're having a briefing, like roll call and, you know, we're talking  about the assignments and everything and the boss is like, he's being like really serious,  like he's taking it way too serious.  And he's going like, and, uh, when the president comes by, I want you to salute the president. 
[00:56:00]  Don't try to shake his hand.  Don't try to get a picture with him.  And I, and in front of everybody, I go, yeah, but that's the hand that fingered Monica  Lewinsky.  Oh, I got so much fucking trouble for that.  Oh, shit.  You really said that.  What a jerk.  You just really can't keep your yap shut sometimes.  No, no.  I got so much trouble.  Oh, I got fucking yelled at for that.  Did they yell you?  Oh, I got screamed at.  In front of everybody?  In front of everybody. 
[00:56:30]  And then afterwards also.  Were you embarrassed?  No, I didn't care.  Did he get some laughs though from the other guys?  Oh, yeah.  It was fucking, you know, there was 30 people in the room.  Did it kill?  Crack.  Yeah.  It had to have killed.  It had to have that fingered Monica Lewinsky.  That's hilarious.  How close did he get to Clinton?  I have a picture next to his limo.  So not close.  Yeah.  I was, it was a fundraiser at this catering place and I was in the command post at the  catering place.  And I took a picture next to his limo. 
[00:57:00]  Would you have been polite if you met him?  Yeah, you got it.  Yeah.  You wouldn't have been silly.  Can I smell your finger?  Yeah.  Here's a cigar for you, Prez.  Prez.  Elbow.  Elbow, elbow.  Yeah.  When I got a picture with Clinton, I actually said, big fan, big fan.  Big fan.  You don't know what to say.  You don't know what to say, though.  Love your work, right?  You did great at the Bay of Pigs.  Right.  Big fan.  What?  What do you say, though?  You don't know what to say.  It's the president.  You're not supposed to be comfortable meeting him.  You don't feel like we're going to have a little thing.  It's like, no, of course you're not going to have a little thing. 
[00:57:30]  Just get your stupid picture and move on.  But you're talking about the motor kid and everything, and it's not like all the cops  you see.  It's like what you don't see behind the scenes.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's all for show.  All the snipers and the fucking command posts.  Undercover guys.  You know, and SWAT teams staging nearby with fucking dogs and everything.  You know, it's, you know.  There's a route to the hospital blocked.  There's a route to a hospital that has his blood in it.  And his blood type and all that stuff. 
[00:58:00]  And doctors waiting.  Wherever he is, there's a route shut down already to whatever hospital he'll be taking.  Just in case.  Yeah.  That's how they got the Parkland Memorial so fast.  Right.  I don't know who they use for Obama or Clinton or any guys in town now.  What I don't understand, I was watching all those cops yesterday.  I know we're still talking about this, but it was a pretty big deal yesterday.  Yeah.  I mean, you talk about an inside job.  You got all these cops and stuff.  I'm not saying you're thinking one of these guys might be.  You're talking rogue cop.  You're talking rogue cop.  I'm trying to be a little careful here, but that's how it's going to happen, right? 
[00:58:30]  You got all these guys with weapons and, you know, you got to assume a lot of them are not supporters of the president.  Let's just talk in general here.  Well, maybe the Secret Service, though.  That's why the Secret Service is the one surrounding him.  How about Secret Service?  You could, but I imagine they're vetted.  That would be pretty hard to infiltrate.  I'm just saying the odds are ridiculously, you know.  Sure.  I mean, it could be done.  Sure.  But you wonder.  I mean, a trillion candidate.  Yeah.  Speaking of which. 
[00:59:00]  Let me go to Joe in North Carolina.  What do you say, Joe?  Hey, good morning, gentlemen.  Amen.  Talk about how times have changed.  Back in the late 80s, when George Sr. was president, a good friend of mine had worked for the Republican Party, gave me a call and said, what are you doing tomorrow?  And I said, well, you know, I got work.  He goes, we need drivers for the motorcade.  Back then, all that was necessary was to get a Social Security number.  They would call it into the FBI. 
[00:59:30]  That night, I had to go to the Hyatt in Chicago.  This is back when I lived outside of Chicago.  Went ahead and met with this special agent.  Kind of told us what was going to happen.  Said, come back here 9 o'clock in the morning.  Showed up back 9 o'clock in the morning at the Hyatt.  Gave us the cars.  We drove it over to Meck's Field.  Got out of the car.  They were going to search the vehicle.  Then we had to go through Metal Security.  And then it was sit by the car for the next, you know, two hours.  And I was about the sixth car behind George Sr. 
[01:00:00]  Wow, sixth car.  That's impressive.  You could tell that story at a barbecue a few times.  Sure you could.  And it's not like that.  Better than most stories you tell at a barbecue.  You think?  You think that his whole life revolves around that he was the sixth car from the barbecue?  Let me ask you a question.  Are you married, man?  Me?  Yeah, of course.  How many times have you started that story?  Out of the corner of your eye, you see your wife roll her eyes and walk away. 
[01:00:30]  Well, what I do have are photographs of the incident that I drove in.  And I got a letter from the White House that stated, thank you for your time helping you during my visit to Chicago.  Oh, that's cool.  I am not lying.  Honestly, God, it struck me dead.  That's how it was back then.  Right.  Okay.  Good job, brother.  Hey, here's a, here's a, this guy goes way back.  Dave in Virginia.  Dave?  Hey, yeah.  Back in the late 80s, I was in the Army called, here to call the Old Guard, put us back to our support service, carry cats, get through the cemetery, walk to Matt, get through them and all that other stuff. 
[01:01:00]  But whenever anybody would come into the White House, we would have to be there, big old dog and pony show with all the other services.  Everybody had the White House clearance, but yet we still had, uh, be searched and with a photo ID to get on the ground.  They would check all our weapons for firing pins, although they all had bayonets on them.  But the limo doors that anybody would show up in has a secret button on the door, whereas they would bring a limo to Fort Myers and let us practice opening these doors so we don't screw it up there in front of the whole nation. 
[01:01:30]  And if you did it wrong, you'd have to knock on the window and try to get the driver's attention so you can unlock the door so people can get in that, can get out.  There's, um, Jesus.  Yeah.  Want to buy a limo door?  I've learned in this past hour that a few of our listeners have kind of gotten close to the president. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sort of, kind of, got close.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I was close enough to, uh, Reagan and Gorbachev when he came into town the first time, uh, December 7th, 87th.  Right.  Uh, but, I mean, there's just the KGB and Secret Service everywhere, just on the White House lawn.  They must have gotten along well.  I bet you those guys, I bet you KGB and Secret Service did because neither one of them wanted  a fucking problem.  They probably worked together all, like, you know, like, we gotta do this, let's just fucking...  Yeah.  Nobody wants someone to get shot.  Spying on each other. 
[01:02:30]  They think they had beers together and no one knows?  I don't know, probably.  They're just grunts.  I mean, they're guys that...  After a long day's work, they had a few pops.  They're probably on one of the Secret Service's fedoras, or, uh, KGB fedoras, because that's  how you can find them all.  They all got the same job, really.  Yeah.  KGB Secret Service, they're the same...  I would...  I think a Secret Service agent would love to talk to a KGB guy and vice versa, you know,  just to see what you do.  I think you would tell each other those secrets.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, right.  That would be...  Let me tell you what the security is, uh...  After a few beers together, though, you're talking... 
[01:03:00]  Tell you what the protocol is.  Right.  Yeah, you can compare suits and how you hide your weapons.  All right, thank you.  Yeah, yeah, all right.  Punch you now.  Absolutely.  All right, happy birthday, Jimmy.  One more, and then, uh, let's try to get out of this.  Well, all the phones are just fucking lit.  Everyone has a story.  Tim in Nashville.  What's up, Tim?  Tim.  Hey, guys.  Uh, I love the show, and, uh, I work in, uh, I used to work at Monroe University, which  was the main trauma center for the entire town, and, uh, we've had presidents and vice  presidents come in town on a fairly regular basis, and any time, uh, when the president 
[01:03:30]  or vice president, either one was in town, uh, they would block off an entire  wing of the emergency room and would not let anybody in just in case something happened  to whichever one it was, whether we had, uh, Al Gore came in to Vanderbilt a lot, and,  uh, you know, we've had various trips, but they would block off the entire wing for it.  Just in case.  Yeah.  So your stitches have to wait for your dumb softball accidents.  Oh, imagine how long you'd have to wait in the emergency room, waiting room. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  Uh, yeah, the president's in here.  Um, sorry.  Well, no, not even in here.  That's, yeah, yeah.  Not even.  Just, it's, uh, just in case.  Just in case.  In my movie, I'm doing a thing where I, I'm the lead investigator, and I go in there,  and they go, what do you need, Agent Chipperson?  They say, damn it, this is our investigation, and I say, yeah, it was your investigation,  Buster Bob.  And I go in there, and I save everything.  Steve in Jersey.  Steve.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hi, Steve. 
[01:04:30]  What's the guy's name?  Yeah, we, uh, I'm in the military, and we carry around, uh, uh, about five years ago  when I was doing this, we carry around the president's stuff, his limos, his helicopters  and whatnot, whenever he goes somewhere, because that stuff's got to get there, too.  And, uh, if you, if you ever open up the trunk of the limo, there's, uh, a shitload  of stickers plastered in there, uh, from everybody's squadron, uh, from the patches that they get.  They also make stickers from them, and you open up the trunk, and it's just plastered  with stickers, uh, everywhere.  And, uh, I, you know, it's not like he's going to go in there and get his luggage or 
[01:05:00]  anything.  And, uh, there's also a rumor, an urban legend, I don't know if it's true, about a guy who,  about somebody who put, uh, a bumper sticker on the limo that said, I voted for the other  guy or something like that.  I don't know if that one's true, though.  I doubt it.  I, uh, I doubt it.  How would that get through?  Well, well, it gets, on the plane, the guy put it on there, and then when, when the limo  rolls off, I mean, it's spotted right away, don't get me wrong, it's not like he was  motricating down and with that bumper sticker on. 
[01:05:30]  I'm just saying, during the flight, we're kind of the only ones with the access to it.  Um, you know, the Secret Service guys upstairs and whatever, so, you know, if somebody wanted  to do that, not a smart career move, but, uh, you know, they could do something like  that, but that's how we get, like, the stickers in the trunk.  Did another guy put a, uh, a sticker on and said, if this limo's a-rockin', don't come  knockin'.  Gas, grass, or ass, nobody rides for free.  Yes, of course.  Wow.  Yeah, Clint had a wow sticker on his limo.  All right, well, these stories are just terrific. 
[01:06:00]  Thank you, Steve in Jersey.  We were walking home yesterday, and you were telling me about somebody that took a flight  with, uh, George W.  Oh, yeah, Jonathan, my manager's friend, um, is a director, and he was on a flight, I believe  it was, uh, Korean Air, and, uh, it was, like, an overnight flight or something, it was first  class, which was probably an expensive flight.  Yeah.  And he's on the plane, getting ready to leave, and Secret Service comes on, two guys come  on, look around, and then, uh, and W gets on, sits in first class.  I think a couple agents sat up there with him, and- 
[01:06:30]  What was he flying in that for?  Now he's flying commercial.  Oh, this was beforehand.  No, this is after he was president.  Oh, after!  Oh, oh, oh.  It's in the last year.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, oh, oh.  And then a couple guys went into, like, business class or whatever, because nobody knows he's  going to fly, and then they just back out and take off.  And most people probably don't even know he's on the plane.  Yeah.  Most people in the cabin don't know.  So, and he wound up, um, he talked to him the whole flight, because there was a couple  of them in first.  Oh, God.  And he wound up sitting next to him and talking to him the whole flight. 
[01:07:00]  How annoying.  I know.  Would you shut up?  I'm tired.  But Jimmy and I were walking ourselves through the same scenario.  Imagine you're on a 22-hour flight, and we're asking each other, do you sleep?  Knowing that George W. is across the way from you, I say you don't sleep.  No.  The entire 22 hours.  You just gotta, what, gawk at him?  At least gawk and maybe try to, you know, get some small talk going.  They talked.  Hey, how you doing?  Yeah, that's right.  President can talk to anyone.  Sleep down.  A guy like that can probably talk to anybody.  He's gonna kill time.  What's he gonna do?  Just look at you? 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  So he yapped with him, and they ate together, and I guess they slept, woke up, ate again.  I mean, it's a long flight.  I'd be awake the whole time just waiting for him to wake up, just staring at him.  Hi.  What are you dreaming about?  What are you dreaming?  What are you dreaming about, Prez?  I know I'd run out of things to say quickly.  Just flying in the middle of the night.  Yeah, I'd say something stupid.  Dude, I know I'd say something stupid.  How great would it be if he fell asleep, and you get to see him just drooling or something?  Yeah, or you get to see his hand rubbing his fucking dick and balls to his pants.  Because he's bored.  It's a long flight. 
[01:08:00]  This plane goes down.  I'm not gonna get any coverage, right?  Yeah, you really think that would be a big story?  President of the United States and comedian.  And comedian Jim Norton.  Killed.  As the plane goes down.  You would just be.  Of course.  Nothing.  They would list me with the luggage.  All right, why don't we take a break into some other things, right?  Yeah, I gotta eat.  I'm gonna be in Atlanta tonight, tomorrow, Saturday. 
[01:08:30]  I gotta plug.  Yeah, very cool.  Punchline.  Tonight, tomorrow, Saturday.  The chick is out.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony show on Sirius XM.  Hey, I want to play the Sandy Cain, Mel Gibson remix from yesterday.  Brilliant. 
[01:09:00]  From D-Boy.  And then we'll give you a little update on Sandy Cain.  Yeah, I want to hear what's going on.  What Anthony's up to.  See if any more phone calls came in.  Got some plans for this afternoon.  Those phone calls are worth playing again, too, don't you think?  Oh, yeah.  Maybe we should get those, E-Rock.  Yeah, those are amazing.  But first, let's play this.  My fucking hat, which I need to work, is gone.  All right.  You know I need that to work, to make a living.  How dare you?  You're blaming me right now. 
[01:09:30]  You don't care about anyone but yourself.  And your fucking stupid fucking failed career.  You know better than the naked cowboy.  And you were.  Shit!  How dare you lie like that?  Dishonest, fucking, gold-dinking, cunt.  Now I'm sure you whore.  You know, I did over backwards for you.  You fucking glum cunt.  You know, for you stupid makeup artists.  Shut up.  You threw away my eyelashes.  I had a day today, buy new eyelashes.  You're a fucking sham.  And I don't have my fucking hat. 
[01:10:00]  I am going to the police.  What?  And I am filing, I'm going to the police department.  I'm filing a police report that you robbed my hat.  You're a dishonest cunt.  What are you hoping to accomplish with that?  What, are you going to pay me back?  How dare you act like such a bitch?  I am filing a police report that you robbed my hat.  Fuck you.  I don't involve, I don't involve the police in anything because I stand up for myself. 
[01:10:30]  You, you weak cunt.  You call a fucking cop.  If it wasn't robbed, you would have the courtesy to call me and say,  Sandy, you forgot your hat up here.  I know how much it means to you and your business as the naked cowgirl.  I should have woke you up and said, fucking blow me, bitch.  I should have fucking woken you up and said, blow me.  You would have liked that better, yeah?  Thank you for your friendship.  Call me.  Fucking cunt.  That's all you're good for.  That's about all you're fucking good at.  You there? 
[01:11:00]  Believe me, I'm going to the police about this.  I am going, I'm going to do a charge, a harassment against you guys.  For what?  For me being drunk and disorderly?  For hitting you?  For what?  I'm very friendly with the cops in New York, by the way.  And they like me.  They treat me with respect, not like you.  You don't have any fucking friends except me.  Never mind.  What the fuck were you going to say?  I'm telling you, don't ever fucking call me again or I'll kill you. 
[01:11:30]  I'm threatening you.  I'll put you in a fucking rose garden, you cunt.  You understand that?  Because I'm capable of it.  You understand that?  I swear to God, I will take a gun and fucking kill you.  Fuck you.  And you can rot unless you crawl back, suck my cock, and say you're sorry in that order.  Do you understand me?  You asshole, fat, fuck you.  Eat shit.  It's amazing, isn't it?  Yeah.  It totally fits.  Great job, brother.  It's so good that it really just does sound like a conversation. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, absolutely.  Mental patience just going at each other.  And I guess we don't have to play the Sandy Cain voicemails because the best parts are in there.  That was pretty much it.  But basically, Sandy Cain has now officially threatened our lives over a hat that she left behind  when we were doing that dumb Britney Spears makeover thing with her the other day.  Sandy not happy about this.  No.  And Janine got a hold of me on Twitter and she said, I fucking gave her new fake eyelashes.  Like, Janine did the right thing for her.  She forgets about it.  She forgets about all that stuff. 
[01:12:30]  She just forgets shit?  Yeah, she forgets all that good shit.  Is she crazy or batshit crazy?  Batshit crazy.  Batshit crazy.  You thinking that?  Sandy's been batshit crazy for years.  Unstable?  I guess she's had enough shit happen in her life that's just made her fucking batshit crazy.  Yeah.  And then she leaves her hat here and freaks out like that, calling people death threats,  calling us all assholes and shit.  What do you mean?  She's been on our show.  She's gotten publicity from our show.  Yeah, we've gotten, you know, mileage out of her. 
[01:13:00]  It works both ways.  It works both ways with all these people.  Of course it does.  They bring us great radio and they get some exposure.  No one knew who Sandy Cain was until she started doing our show.  I'm sorry, Sandy, but no one knew who the fuck you were.  Maybe a small...  A little niche of people that saw her cable access show.  We certainly built her audience to a bigger place.  Plotto and her hemorrhoid.  Right.  All that fun stuff. 
[01:13:30]  I hear from fans all the time when they come to New York, they search her out.  Not every fan, but certainly a bunch of fans have done that and got their picture taken  with Sandy Cain and Times Square, giving her money.  Right.  And she lost her fucking mind yesterday.  And I wanted an update, but why would Steve or anybody be here with an update?  I want to know what happened.  What do they do?  Are they doing another job here?  Well, what I did was I was showing you the penthouse photo.  And then he walks down the hall because he doesn't think it's urgent. 
[01:14:00]  Take your time.  No problem.  Well, I'm running now.  You see my coffee?  It's shaking.  Yeah.  Steve.  I want an update.  What were you doing that you didn't...  There is no update.  The update is she's not answering her phone.  Well, that's an update.  All right.  There is no update.  She's not answering her phone.  Right.  And I did get a call from her attorney yesterday.  That's an update.  But I don't think...  How many more non-updates are you going to give me that are updates?  Well, that's not enough.  I don't think that has anything to do with this. 
[01:14:30]  I think this is the entertainment lawyer that's handling the naked cowboy thing.  So, did you call him back?  I got it late last night.  So, I'm going to call him back tonight.  I bet he...  Wake his ass up.  I bet she called him about her hat.  And wants him to handle the great hat controversy.  Jimmy, are you all right over there?  I am, yes.  What time did he call last night?  The hat.  8 o'clock. 
[01:15:00]  He called at 8?  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess a guy like that goes to bed at 8.30.  Yeah, you should have called him back.  Well, I'll call him and wake him up.  He did say late last night.  He did say late last night.  I apologize.  It's very, very late.  8 o'clock.  8 o'clock.  I apologize.  It isn't even late at night for us.  Yeah.  And we get up pretty goddamn early.  I look at the clock when it's 8 o'clock and go, cool, it's still early.  Yeah, I don't think it's that late yet.  And I get up at 4.45 every morning. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Sleepy.  8 o'clock or when reruns stop on TV and actual shows start.  Right, right.  Real shows start, right.  It's called prime time.  He called during prime time.  It was extremely late.  Yes, it was the witching hour.  Safe to say you had at least two, maybe three hours before the guy would go, what the fuck  are you doing?  This is a little late to call.  It was the wee hours of dusk.  Yeah, the sun is still up, technically.  He called while I was dumping the remnants of my lunch in the garbage pail. 
[01:16:00]  Supper was being cooked.  He called late last night and I can look out my apartment and still see the sun at 8.  Yeah.  Yes, you can.  You can read outside at 8 o'clock without a false light.  Right.  I will rephrase.  He called and I didn't know that he called because I didn't look at the phone.  Very, very late.  But don't you see that the Sandy Cain thing is a big fucking deal right now on our show?  Yes.  She threatened our lives, so we sort of want updates.  Right.  Well, there is no update on the I haven't gotten a hold of her front. 
[01:16:30]  Did you try calling her yet today?  Yeah, I have.  And she's not picking up.  It goes right to voicemail.  Still?  Yes.  Well, how is she going to get her hat back if she doesn't answer her phone?  I don't fucking care.  She threatened to kill me.  I hope she gets hit by a fucking dump truck.  We care as a radio show, though.  Well, I understand that, but personally, I don't give a shit what happens to that bag lady.  See, we've got to fill up this time with something, Steve.  Yes.  And the Sandy Cain thing is a big one.  So call her fucking lawyer back immediately.  And even if it has nothing to do with the death threat or the hat, we want to know what 
[01:17:00]  he wanted.  That's all.  All right?  Yes.  You all right, Jimmy?  Yes.  You all right?  Yeah, I'm so irritated.  I've got to fly it in a small plane.  I'm so angry.  You don't like those?  No!  Yeah.  Fucking continental.  Assholes.  They're just, they're not fun to be on.  They don't have a service.  They got one fucking, one stew that's been thrown off of the commercial, the big planes 
[01:17:30]  because she just can't quite cut it anymore.  Or she never got on the big planes because she's just, you know.  And then she just brings by a beer for me.  Here you go.  Clunk.  The plastic cup on top of the can.  Yeah, geez.  This is service.  Let me dig into my pocket and get the fiber for you.  Oh, God.  I hate those.  That's true.  Those suck.  Sandy Cain, did you give up on making that video, Ed?  Nope.  We're all looking forward to this thing.  Well, yesterday, the indoor range closes now fucking early in the summer. 
[01:18:00]  I can't stand it.  What's early?  Eight o'clock at night?  Yeah.  It's very, very early.  Eight.  He called at eight.  The sun is still up.  Eight.  He called very late.  Woke me up.  Eight o'clock.  That's fucking classic Steve right there.  He woke me up.  What time was it?  7.45 a.m. during the show.  I was sleeping. 
[01:18:30]  I was in REM sleep.  Retards eye movements.  Why wouldn't you call the guy back?  Because it's late.  She said she was going to fucking shoot us.  We should be calling the NYPD, first of all.  Well, I was going to go and take her hat and take it to the range and see how well it could 
[01:19:00]  hold up to a .50 caliber handgun round or two or 18 or 20.  That means we're not giving the hat back.  We'll give it back.  I'll give it back.  It'll look better.  She didn't.  Okay.  And in this hot weather, it'll probably be a little more ventilated for her wig.  That's if the hat is even usable because we have a theory.  Me and Danny, we're working out a theory. 
[01:19:30]  But the indoor range is only 25 yards, around 30 yards, and I can't fire the Barrett .50 cal  rifle.  So I say, you know something, let's wait till tomorrow, which is now today.  Me and Danny, after work, going to head down to Calverton, the range out in Calverton.  So if you're out in the boondocks, stop by and say hi.  Going to take the Barrett .50 cal.  I'm going to take my SP-89 9mm, the .50 cal Desert Eagle. 
[01:20:00]  And put this, first we'll put it at 200 yards, we'll blast it with the Barrett, which we're  thinking, this hat isn't just a little straw hat, it isn't thin, it's got some bulk to it.  It could just completely explode the second that Barrett round hits it.  Really?  Because it's not like a shitty paper hat or whatever.  Yeah, it's actually like a decently weighted felt cowboy hat, so it has a little more 
[01:20:30]  suede-ish, leather-ish.  It has more mass than like a shitty straw hat or whatever.  Something like that, it's got a lot more energy that's going to go through it.  It might just explode.  It could just completely explode the hat.  We'll sweep up all the pieces, which would be fun.  We'll FedEx her hat back to her.  Hey, are you two going to shoot together like Danny Glover and Mel Gibson at the end of  the first lethal weapon?  Yes.  Him under your, both under the same coat.  Smoke. 
[01:21:00]  We are just going to unload on this fucking thing, though.  Two guns at once.  And I'm going to put a camera right near the target, right near the hat, pointing at it,  a little flip cam.  What, right next to the hat?  Yeah, so we'll be able to get a target view and a view from us shooting.  Oh, right on.  And then edit it together, it'll look nice, and you'll get a really good view of what  it was like to shoot the shit out of Sandy's dumb, naked cowgirl with the bumper sticker 
[01:21:30]  cut up on the front to say, naked cowgirl, a hat.  Yeah, I think we were too good to her over the years.  Are we done with her now, too?  Well, she's fucking turned into a raging cunt.  No, we're not done with her.  We should absolutely continue with her.  The kookier she is, the better she is.  Yeah, we do like a kooky Sandy.  She accuses everybody of rape.  She's nuts.  It was rape.  Lincoln raped me.  Come on, man. 
[01:22:00]  Steve raped me.  It was very late.  It was six o'clock at night.  It was late when he called.  It was late at night.  Yes, very, very late.  Eight o'clock in the middle of winter feels late, right, Ant?  Not in the middle of summer.  No, in the middle of summer, eight o'clock is, it's still light.  You're still doing outdoor activities.  It's still light.  You could tan at eight o'clock at night.  Right. 
[01:22:30]  He is a pisser.  All right.  So you'll make that video today.  Yes, yeah, we're going out there.  So if anybody, you know, wants to go out there, check it out, into guns.  If you're not into guns, stay home.  I don't want to hear you.  I want no fan fucking leaning over my shoulder saying, what's that?  What does that do?  Well, that's a big round.  Stay awake.  Does that happen?  No, not at a range.  But if I say that we're going to be there, it's turning into an appearance now. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  Why is that a different hat?  Yeah, that's why Travis linked it to me.  Um, he just sent me a picture of the last time Sandy was on the show.  And this is clearly a completely different hat.  That is a red, white, and blue straw hat.  Yeah, that hat goes much better with what she wears.  Not the suede type hat that she had, that we now have custody of.  So she does have more hats.  Yeah.  Wouldn't it be great to be able to shoot at it with her head in it?  Yeah. 
[01:23:30]  I want to shoot those pasties off her nipples.  Oh, that'd be great, too.  Those fucking awful inverted nipples.  Nasty.  Catch my round.  Oh, look at the rats.  Nice rat cam.  There, there's a rat fucking video on local news here in New York.  Why, though?  Where are all these rats?  It's in lower Manhattan, but is that news that there's a bunch of rats at night?  It's an epidemic.  We're dispatching some exterminators soon.  Well, we hope so, anyway.  Coming up on Good Day New York.  An update on that suspicious car that shut down the Throgs Neck Bridge.  The bridge has been reopened, but delays remain. 
[01:24:00]  Which means it shouldn't have been a suspicious car.  Just a broken down car.  Just some asshole.  A lot of people abandon their cars when they break down on bridges for some reason.  Yeah, and then they just walk off and leave their car.  They get a phone call, or they make a phone call, they get a friend to pick them up, and  then they just fucking drive.  They just leave the car there thinking nothing of it.  Yeah.  Thinking, ah, this couldn't cause any problems.  No one thinks shit like that.  Or they leave, like, a fucking briefcase sitting somewhere.  Oh, yeah, I didn't want it anymore.  Yeah. 
[01:24:30]  Assholes.  Elizabeth Hasselbeck.  Yes.  Where's it back?  Hasselbeck.  Beck, right?  Beck?  Someone put an A on the end of her name here, making it Hasselbeck.  It'd be Hasselbeck.  I believe it's Hasselbeck.  I don't know.  She had this to say.  There is a rise, speaking of Christina, in late-blooming lesbians.  More and more women are choosing same-sex partners, even after decades of heterosexuality.  Like, why do you think that is?  Is that saying, as women get older, it's just like a been-there-done-that kind of thing, 
[01:25:00]  and I'm open to it?  No, I'll tell you what's happening.  That Sherry Shepard is one of the dumbest broads walking on this fucking planet.  She is as dumb as they come.  Yeah, yeah, she's a real adult.  I'm amazed that this stupid Barbara Walters hasn't realized that and gotten another black  woman that could maybe talk intelligently about what's going on in the world.  She's the flat Earth one, right?  Yeah, she thinks the fucking Earth is flat.  She didn't know if the Earth was flat or round.  Well, she didn't want to answer the question because she's too busy raising her children  or something.  I don't pay attention to that stuff.  Oh, really? 
[01:25:30]  You don't know that the Earth is round, you dunce?  What an idiot.  Can we play that clip again?  Yeah, yeah.  It's one of my favorite clips of all time.  It really is angering to listen to.  Look, if you saw it on some college TV broadcast, you're like, well, whatever.  But it's the view.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  That's like supposed to be highbrow TV shit.  Oh, yeah.  They're supposed to kind of know a little bit about everything.  And you don't make it that far and not know that the world is round. 
[01:26:00]  And she also believes that the Earth is only, what, 2,000 years old or something?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  She's got that Earl fucking sickness.  Yeah, she said nothing predates Jesus.  Oh, that's Jesus.  Nothing predates Jesus.  What a asshole.  They can prove that very easily.  They have proved it.  Which one do you want to start with?  I fucking hate religious people.  Then we'll get to this new clip.  Earl believes in that.  Does he?  Yeah, he does.  Look where he is.  Exactly.  Nowhere.  Look what he is.  He's got that Black Rock Coalition.  It's starting to happen for him. 
[01:26:30]  Doesn't he have a book out?  It's starting to happen for him.  I think he wrote a book about Black Rock Coalition.  It's starting to happen.  Pamphlet.  I hear the book did well.  Yeah, did it?  He had a book release party and everything.  No, he didn't.  Oh, yeah, he did.  Oh, Earl's a mover and shaker.  He sure is.  He's on to big things now.  What's the book called?  Black Rock Coalition, I think.  God, what a bomb that must have been.  He's just latched onto that.  Oh, there's a lot of Black Rock artists out there.  Black Rock Coalition.  What coalition?  Buy the record or don't? 
[01:27:00]  You've got to call it a coalition any time that you have a group of black people.  What do they do?  It's a coalition.  Do they do shows anywhere?  Black Rock?  No one cares about them.  I believe they had a little book party and then a black rock band played and Earl might  have even signed some copies of his book.  That must have been a heinous party.  Oh, I heard it was a success.  In Living Color?  It's not even together anymore, are they?  Yeah, they are.  No one talks about this. 
[01:27:30]  Well, they play everywhere but the United States.  There it is.  Black Rock Volume 1 by Earl Douglas.  Why are we making fun of Earl?  There it is.  He's finally doing something.  Is he published?  On his own.  He's published?  Who's the, what is that, a disc?  It's a website.  What?  It's a website where you can make your own books.  Wait, no.  Let me see the author picture, please.  Oh, no.  You can flip through his book online.  Where is it?  I think people should buy Earl's book.  Wait, is this that Apple thing where you write a book and then Apple sends you the book? 
[01:28:00]  It's Blurb.com.  It's Blurb.com.  You make your own book online and then you order copies.  Oh, my God.  He's proud of this, man.  It's all the pictures he's taken over the years of black artists.  There's no writing in his book, I don't think.  Well, there's no writing.  And it turns into a coffee table.  Yeah, you're allowed to, like, check out, I don't know, something like 20 pages of the book  and then you've got to decide if you want to see the rest, you've got to buy it.  Ladies and gentlemen, with his new book, Earl Douglas. 
[01:28:30]  Give him a big hand.  Here on Regis.  I'm going to make a book like this with all the old N.E.W. pictures.  Who are these people?  Of Earl just loafing.  Is that it?  No, that's the preview.  Tick tock.  Preview shows.  The clock.  See?  Preview only shows 27 pages of the book.  And then you decide if you want to see more.  Of a 28-page book.  Yeah, man.  There's a 14 that showed most of them twice.  And it's called, thank you, Black Rock Volume 1. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, so we can expect more.  Yes.  He's already working on Volume 2.  God.  How do these people get this?  Blurb.com slash books 1138998, I think.  Is that how you have to find it?  We should actually order one.  We should order one for the show.  Yeah, we really should.  Yeah, why not?  If you Google Black Earl book, you'll find it.  Black Earl book.  Well, Jimmy, if you want to order it, you can get the hardcover with the image wrap, and  that's $51.95. 
[01:29:30]  $51.95?  It's hard to sell photography books, man.  Or softcover for $29.95.  I wonder how many books he has sold.  I wonder what Earl's cut is on this.  Whatever number he tells us, we've got to cut that in half.  Author.  Oh, do you got the picture there?  I want to see his author photo.  Because he looks pensive and thoughtful.  He looks very pensive.  Thoughtful.  It just stays as a thumbnail, though.  Why can't you make that fucker bigger?  Well, you have to copy it. 
[01:30:00]  I want to see it.  He's got the...  That's okay.  He's got his hand in front of his face.  He's deep in thought.  Yes, very deep in thought.  He's a man of a few words.  A few thoughts.  Let me see.  I don't even know how to describe his pose.  That's Earl just not doing his job.  He's got his hands clasped in front of his face, and he's got a watch on his right wrist,  and he's kind of leaning on his mouth. 
[01:30:30]  His head is kind of resting on the back of the right hand, looking over it as if he's a  man who's been caught in thought by a paparazzi.  Yes, like he just looked up.  He's in a diner.  Yeah, where is that?  Brooklyn Diner or something?  Oh, my God.  This is Earl.  Oh.  Hey, Earl.  Yo.  Hi, Earl.  Welcome.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony show.  We haven't talked to our friend Earl in quite some time on the air.  And we're talking about Black Rock Volume 1, finally, Earl.  Finally. 
[01:31:00]  Congratulations.  You're an author now, right?  Yes.  Thank you, guys.  Walk us through it, though.  You found a website where you can make your own book?  Yes.  It's blurb.com, where you basically can do it on your own.  They give you the software and whatever you want to put up there, you put up there, and  then you sell it through Blurb.  And how are sales?  They're doing okay.  I mean, there's, you know, the other thing is you've got to do everything completely on 
[01:31:30]  your own, so that's, and the hard part is kind of doing everything on your own.  It's not doing anything.  I hear you.  Well, let me ask you now, what's the cut you have to split with them?  Oh.  Um, you, I know they take pretty much, they take a pretty sizable chunk, but then you  can determine what your profit is on top of the price that they already set.  Wait, what do you mean?  So, let's say, you know, it depends on the size of the book. 
[01:32:00]  So, I mean, my, my, the softcover version is like $29.95.  Yeah.  You know, and I get like, so I made my percentage very small because it, it cost me nothing really  to put the book together because I already have the shots already.  Does it cost them a lot to actually make it?  Uh, yes, because the quality is very good.  Okay.  The quality is extraordinarily good.  So, percentage-wise, ballpark, percentage-wise, how much do they get? 
[01:32:30]  Uh, wow, about 80%.  I mean, again, it depends on the profit you said.  I, like, on the hardcover, I make, look, $10 a book.  Out of 50?  Uh, 50.  One.  That's actually not bad.  One bucks.  That's not a bad deal.  Ten bucks a book.  How do they make 41?  What is their cost for each book?  Uh, again, it's like, it's like 41.  And I said, you know, again, it didn't really cost me anything.  You know what, I'll make 10 bucks on the hardcover.  But that's not-  They're the ones that print it. 
[01:33:00]  They're the ones that, you know.  That's the advertising cost.  That's not bad, because when Anthony and I put out a CD, what did we share?  75 cents a CD or something?  Uh, yeah, yeah, it was great.  And then we had to split the 75 cents between each other, obviously.  Yeah, it was fantastic.  And that supposedly was a good deal.  As the shyster got fucking everything.  Yeah, how much was it selling for?  Almost 15 bucks a CD back then?  God, I guess.  Maybe 12-something?  I don't know.  75 cents.  We got 75 cents.  We were real smart back then. 
[01:33:30]  Yep.  But, Earl, how many books have you sold?  How many have I sold?  Probably about 20.  I don't know.  You said-  Again, I don't care.  Didn't he say the sales were going well?  You do care.  No one puts out a book or any type of CD or anything and not care.  You do care.  You want people to buy this thing.  Yeah, you wanted to get your work out there.  Oh, absolutely.  But, I mean, for me, it was more of getting the thing out,  because it came from another book. 
[01:34:00]  It was supposed to be a larger book.  Yeah.  But, you know, the deal completely fell apart.  And I really wrote the book out of frustration.  Oh.  You know, because I was supposed to do like a actual physical big text,  almost like a textbook.  Wasn't it titled What You Want on This Wall?  Well, not your first book about frustration.  Or I Can't Find the Sticker Stop. 
[01:34:30]  It's been years, but we haven't forgotten.  Of course not.  Never forget.  Of course not, Earl.  Linger longer.  Now, Earl, the important question here is how long has this book been out?  Go.  It's been out since February.  So since February you sold 20 copies, so that's, you know, pretty bad.  Brisk.  Let's say those are brisk sales.  And you had a four-a-month.  Four-a-week.  I'll be the first to admit, I have probably done the single worst bit of, 
[01:35:00]  I've done everything backwards as far as any type of marketing.  I've done it completely backwards.  What do you mean, Earl?  What did you do?  No, because you're supposed to have a website and have everything set up.  You didn't have a website?  I just put it out.  I did it totally, you know, I kind of punk rocked it.  I just completely put it out on my own.  Right.  Punk rocked it.  Something rigged it.  But didn't you have a book signing party? 
[01:35:30]  Oh, yeah.  And wasn't there press there?  I saw some of these pictures.  Yeah, that was probably the one thing I got right.  A friend of mine, Denise, helped put this amazing party together at the Hard Rock.  Oh.  How many people showed up?  And don't lie or I'll know.  Um, if I, I mean, the room fit like 120 people.  Everyone that bought a book.  It was probably about 100.  Wait, the room fit 120 people at the Hard Rock?  Well, it wasn't at the Hard Rock. 
[01:36:00]  It was in the New York room inside the Hard Rock.  Ah, right.  I'm going to put out a, uh, sunset, uh, table book.  Yeah?  And hope to sell more books than the Black Rock volume one.  Sunsets?  Just sunsets.  I'm going to make one over here?  You mean I'm going to make one on blurb.com, Anthony?  That's right.  That's a good idea.  They take too much.  They sure do, Jimmy.  They sure do.  Hold on a minute.  Dave in New York City wants to talk to Black Earl.  Dave?  Yeah, I did this book for my kid's first birthday for my wife. 
[01:36:30]  And every time I hear Earl talk about this, it drives me fucking insane.  Why?  It's like, dude, I respect what you're trying to do and all.  And I, this isn't Scheinman and fucking Schuster here.  You know, come on, dude.  And you had a party in the bathroom at the Hard Rock?  It's the New York room, sir.  They put the cameras up on the shitter so they can shine over the stall?  Come on, dude.  I, you know, I love you, Earl, but give me a break.  Are you saying that Earl is overplaying his whole book thing? 
[01:37:00]  Word.  I love you guys.  You guys are the best.  Dave gets so mad.  You know, Earl is just, uh.  He's trying.  Trying is part of his dream.  Right.  This Black Rock Coalition, uh, the, the book and everything.  I don't know why people gotta be such haters.  Uh, what's with the haters, Earl?  You know, I, you know, I, I can never really explain why.  You know, it's the whole, the whole con, people are just against the concept. 
[01:37:30]  Of black people playing rock music?  Earl, what is, what is the exactly?  Despite the fact that, you know, they invented it.  So what's the concept of?  Oh.  Yes, it's true.  It's absolutely true.  I don't think anybody minds black people playing rock, but what is the Black Rock Coalition?  Like, what are they fighting against?  Yeah, I think you make it too angry.  Like, but what, yeah.  It's not, it's not angry at all.  It never, it never was angry.  Well, coalition is a rough word to use. 
[01:38:00]  Coalition makes it sound a little militant.  Yeah, I think that's where you're going wrong.  It's like Black Rock Militia.  Right.  Black Rock Panthers.  One of the names they floated around was Collective, but I've got to remember when it was formed in 1985, you know, Collective sounded a little cold water.  Anthony, a lot of people doing the math out there.  He quit Ron and Fez, worked for a year, and made $200.  Well, still rolling in, though.  So, now, Earl, the Black Rock Coalition, you started it? 
[01:38:30]  95, sorry.  No, I didn't start it.  It was started by Vernon Reed of Living Color, Greg Tate, who was a writer for the Village Voice, and Conda Mason, she's a manager and an artist rep, and a couple other musicians.  They formed it.  Nobody thinks about it, though.  Do people really think about Black Rock Coalition, or are you like the last holdout?  Yeah, I mean, again, we've been around for 25 years. 
[01:39:00]  We've played some pretty big places.  We've been all over the world, so I think something's going right.  But aren't bands just doing that anyway?  Yeah, who's the biggest Black Rock artist?  Wow.  I would probably say, like, right now, probably TV on the radio.  If I had to guess, Earl Greyhound is amazing.  No one has heard of these people.  I mean, I've heard of TV on the radio.  The TV on the radio is pretty big. 
[01:39:30]  They've heard of them.  Sort of heard of them.  Sort of happening.  But why don't they just get big, like, just being a band?  Who cares if they're a Black Rock band, as opposed to, like, you know what I mean?  Like, they're just a good band.  It's a coalition.  Well, you've also got to remember, people still can't wrap the concept of Blacks playing rock and roll in 2010.  Because most Black teenagers don't listen to it.  That's not exactly true, either.  I mean, there's kind of another organization on top of it.  I went to the Afropunk festival. 
[01:40:00]  That thing's been going on for five or six years.  How many shootings?  No shootings.  Oh, okay, sorry.  It grows every single year.  I mean, it's 30,000.  Roy, let me ask you.  Why don't Black people just enjoy their rock music the way white people do?  You don't have to get together, like, as far as organizing on a race.  Like, how about they just listen to it?  It's always a racial thing because, I don't know, Earl's a little bit of a separatist, too. 
[01:40:30]  I'm not a separatist at all.  A little bit.  It's just this whole notion that, from Blacks and whites, that, you know, there's still this kind of separate but unequal thing going on between Blacks playing rock and roll and between whites playing rock and roll.  Well, a group of artists got together and said, let's take a unified stand and let's be, we want inclusion.  We don't want separate, anything separate.  Oh.  Well, you're kind of separating people by calling to the Black Rock Coalition. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  Makes it feel like you can only be black to listen to the black artists.  Yeah, nobody thinks about black rock or white rock.  If you like it, you like it.  Just rock.  You just want to rock.  Why can't we just rock?  Why not?  I want to rock.  Is Earl really trying to say that black people have been excluded from rock and roll throughout the years?  Yeah.  But they started rock and roll.  Hey, Earl, are you upset?  They stole it from the white man.  Are you upset that 100 people went to your book signing party and only 20 people have bought the book so far? 
[01:41:30]  Well, it was a private party.  But wouldn't you think that every person there would have bought the book?  Ah, good question.  Why didn't everybody that was at the party have bought the book?  That's right.  Well, that was a whole other story.  We'd like to hear it.  That's a lot of stories.  It was kind of a fight between Blurb and I.  I mean, not a fight, but we just had this different opinion.  A fight.  A fight.  You had a problem with your publisher? 
[01:42:00]  Not a problem.  It had some issues with the publisher, but we kind of worked out.  What were the issues, Earl?  Just on the marketing end, because I was trying to get a representative.  I couldn't get a representative to the party.  I was like, send a representative from Blurb.  Just to talk, because we had microphones.  We had my friend Kelsey.  He played.  He set up like a press conference.  So you wanted a representative to come from Blurb? 
[01:42:30]  Where is Blurb based out of?  California, San Francisco.  So they wouldn't fly somebody cross-country to your party in a fucking back room?  For your pop-up book?  Well, they do events all over the country.  Yeah.  They call it a pop-up book or a pappy-up book.  Black Rock.  I'm surprised a bunch of Lost fans didn't accidentally buy it. 
[01:43:00]  Hey.  Well, it sounds like the book's doing very well.  How did they get the book, Earl?  You can go to Blurb.com and type in Black Rock Volume 1 in the search engine and then go from there.  Yeah, let's buy a few books for Earl today.  Secondly, Earl, you believe that the Earth is only 2,000 years old?  No, he doesn't.  More or less?  Not 2,000, no.  How old is the Earth?  I don't know.  About?  I don't know. 
[01:43:30]  I mean, my brain is not...  You've publicly talked about this before.  How old do you think the Earth is?  I don't know.  Six?  I don't know.  6,000 years old?  And that dinosaurs were walking around with people?  Again, I don't know.  Can I ask you something?  Do a lot of black people think that the Earth is only about 6,000 or 2,000 or 3,000 years old?  Because Sherry Shepard believes this shit, too. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, no.  You mean Sherry Sherrod?  Yes, that's who we mean.  No, I don't mean her.  Sherry Shepard.  Sherry Shepard from The View.  Sherry Hempful.  Sherry Hempful.  Do black people in general believe this?  I don't know.  I'm asking you a question today, Earl.  Probably.  I mean, if you biblically speak, you probably, yes.  A lot of black people believe the Earth isn't that old?  I mean, a lot of people take the Bible very literally.  But it doesn't have, like, years, does it? 
[01:44:30]  No, it doesn't.  It doesn't say what year it was.  But do you believe that dinosaurs were walking around the same time that modern-type men were walking around, right?  You don't believe in the evolution and cavemen turning into humans and things like that?  Well, I mean, you know, the coin term, my beliefs have evolved a little bit.  But, yes, I believe that at one point.  Yeah, so you're not into evolution. 
[01:45:00]  And I also said, I said I couldn't wrap my head around, I was like, I said, you know, I made that opinion.  Wow.  I made that opinion.  But I also said, I was like, I couldn't even wrap my whole head around that idea.  I was like, it sounds too crazy.  Wrap your head around a telephone pole.  So you couldn't wrap your head around the whole idea of what?  Of that idea.  I was just like, it sounds crazy. 
[01:45:30]  I said that.  That sounds crazy.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't believe in the fact that, not fact, the theory that has been scientifically proven pretty much,  that we have evolved as a species throughout the years.  You believe in creationism, where it's just, we kind of were plopped down here by some super being in the condition we're in now, right?  I mean, you know, everyone thinks we evolved from apes, and we evolved from this, and we evolved from that. 
[01:46:00]  Wouldn't you, but if we evolved from apes, how come apes haven't evolved?  Well, it branched off.  It branched off.  Again, it's.  Wow.  Completely early in the morning, and I'm not thinking straight.  No, but it branched off so that humans, it wasn't literally an ape, like we see now, that we evolved from,  but it was an ape-like animal that branched off. 
[01:46:30]  One branch became human beings.  The other branch became what we know as gorillas and whatnot.  And I heard that bell.  Oh, shit.  You remember the bell, Earl?  Yeah.  Oh, totally.  The bell rules.  Don't you have some kind of event tonight?  Yes, so we have, tonight is the Rubenstein Atrium, which is on Broadway between 63rd and 64th. 
[01:47:00]  What's with the Jew name?  Hey.  Why didn't you pick a place with a black guy name?  You're at some atrium tonight for a book signing?  Hey, isn't that Rocky's wife?  Oh, Chip.  Yes.  Yes, it's Broadway between 63rd and 64th.  It's at 830 tonight.  Why aren't you uptown, motherfucker?  We're good to be doing a...  125th Street.  Not at 125th, 63rd and 64th. 
[01:47:30]  What is going on tonight, Earl?  We're going to have a live presentation of the book, Q&A,  and we're also going to have Dragons of Vents, who's in the book, play the play about it.  Okay.  What's the name of the place?  The Rubenstein Atrium.  Oh, Atrium.  Oh, I heard something different.  No, Atrium.  A-T-R-I-T-U-M.  Okay. 
[01:48:00]  Okay.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Well, Earl, it sounds like you're doing very well.  What are you doing for a living?  Like, how are you earning money to eat and stuff?  No, I'm doing the whole boiler room thing.  No, I'm just doing the sales thing.  Sales?  So you're doing, like, a telemarketer?  Yeah.  What are you going to tell us?  What are you selling? 
[01:48:30]  What are you selling?  What are you selling?  You know, I'm really thinking about courting because I don't, I'm not particularly...  Yeah, but what are you selling right now?  Like, what do you do?  Give me a little...  Vacation packages.  Give me a little line.  Give me a little line.  Hello?  Yes?  Oh, God.  I can't even remember my own script.  Ta-da.  I'll take eight.  Go ahead.  Give me a little. 
[01:49:00]  Hello?  Yes, Mr. Kumiya.  Yes, speaking.  Yes, I saw recently you were at the gun show.  Yes.  And you filled out a form.  And you filled out a form for a highly discounted Florida Bahamas vacation and cruise for two.  Yes, I did.  Well, Mr. Kumiya, I have some great news for you.  Your name has been selected and you are going to the Bahamas.  Congratulations.  Oh, wow.  What is this going to cost me anything? 
[01:49:30]  It's going to cost you highly discounted.  It's only $3.99 per person.  Oh, well, I'm sorry.  I don't buy anything from ***.  Jesus Christ.  It doesn't change, does it?  You left Ron and Fez for that horse shit?  What the fuck, Earl?  I'm sorry, Earl. 
[01:50:00]  Geez.  Earl's been nothing but a trooper.  I know.  But he has the big book signing today with Q&A.  And one of his black rock artists performing.  So $3.99 a person.  What airline did they fly during this deal of the century?  Fucking value jet?  Yeah, we got you a seat hanging off the wing.  We tie you to the fucking, tie you to the underbelly.  Got to hang on to the wheel well.  Wow.  Yeah.  Hey, that's pretty good there, Earl. 
[01:50:30]  At least you're, you know, you're rocking something.  What?  You know, you got, he's got his, he's got his dreams that he wants to pursue.  And he's not just doing the telemarketing thing.  He's actually branching out and trying to, you know, make something else work.  Well, the cool thing is that there's, actually there's a couple of interests on, to do, to do another one.  To do another book.  It's entirely separate from music.  There's, I want to do this type of presentation.  There's talk about putting this thing, making this kind of a series where we present a different band featured in the book at different venues. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, but why would they want volume two if volume one has only sold 20 copies?  Yeah, and people like, you know, arts organizations.  20 people like it.  20 people like it, so they're like, yeah, we need a volume two.  Shouldn't they be working volume one a lot harder?  I'm, again, I'm working volume one as hard as I can.  And, again, they want to do, like, a lot, again, people want a live presentation with something music related. 
[01:51:30]  So, again, it's been very slow, but.  Like this phone call?  Earl, you should do a commercial about your book.  And you say, I wrote a book, and I told two friends, and they told two friends.  See, that's where it ends, because.  Yeah.  No, so on.  You don't get this, so on and so on.  Exactly.  Oh, Earl.  All right, Earl, it was great catching up with you.  Yeah, go back to sleep.  If you guys want to come out tonight, you know, it's 8.30, Rubenstein 8.30. 
[01:52:00]  It's very late.  That's, all right, give the big plug.  8.30, where?  The Ruben.  That killed me, Jimmy.  Jimmy came up with that one.  That is so goddamn funny, Jimmy. 
[01:52:30]  He does say atrium very strangely, though.  He does.  Kind of stops after the slip of the tongue, Mary.  All right.  Oh, Earl.  Bob Kelly joining the program.  He's doing Helium Comedy Club.  Two shows Friday and Saturday.  We'll talk to Bob Kelly next.  Let me say goodbye.  You're leaving now?  I have to.  Oh, shit in a handbag.  What the fuck is that about?  I got to go to Atlanta, but I also, I got to go to, I have to get certified checks.  What?  Certified checks.  What?  What?  It's a whole thing.  You got to deal with the whole thing today. 
[01:53:00]  You got a whole thing.  A lump cunt.  Fucking phoners.  Yeah.  I don't want to.  Aw, I'm going to miss you, Jimmy.  All right, guys.  Punchline?  Yes, I'll see you.  Atlanta?  See you Monday, boys.  Thursday, Friday, and Saturday with Jim Norton down there in the Atlanta area for everybody.  Go see Jimmy if you're down there in Atlanta.  He's a very funny gentleman.  Yeah, I'll be selling Earl's book.  All right, we'll continue with Bob Kelly next.  This is the Opie and Anthony show on the Fire and Sirius XM. 
[01:53:30]  Opie Anthony and Bob Kelly.  Kelly playing the Helium Comedy Club in Philly.  Yeah.  Tonight, one show, Friday, two shows, Saturday, two shows.  The way it should be.  Okay.  Instead of fucking Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.  Like you did in Columbus, Ohio.  Columbus actually was fucking a lot.  I can't believe how many ONA fans are out in fucking Columbus.  I think we did pretty well in Columbus. 
[01:54:00]  A lot of them showed up.  They were fucking great, too.  Cleveland is a hotbed of activity for ONA.  No, Columbus, Ohio.  Oh, Cleveland is like...  Well, the whole area.  I forgot that it's like Toledo, Cleveland, Detroit.  Everything's like two hours away from each other.  Isn't it sort of...  It's all right there, is what I'm saying.  Yeah.  They're going to love you in Philly, too.  I haven't been there in fucking two years.  I love Philly.  Really?  Yeah, because the fucking guys who do security are Philly guys, so they don't take any shit.  Oh, right.  I just love grabbing somebody by the nape of the neck and tossing them out. 
[01:54:30]  Throw them out the door, old school style.  You like when clubs take care of the comedian that way?  Fucking...  Oh, my God.  It makes me so happy.  Did you see the heckle scene on Louie's show the other night?  I was watching it like it was memories.  I've done the same...  In the same club.  I had the same thing.  It's the cellar.  A lot of the stand-up scenes are filmed at the cellar.  And Caroline's, those two clubs that we know very well.  But it's so specific to the person that usually does it.  It's the hot white girl who's never been told to shut her fucking mouth. 
[01:55:00]  No one ever said, you're an idiot.  Shut your face.  She's never flinched.  She's never had to flinch from a backhand.  She's only seen guys, like, looking lovingly into her eyes, no matter what drivel is coming  out of her mouth.  Right.  Everybody's just said, no, it's okay.  No one ever said, shut your fucking mouth.  Some fucking asshole guy who goes and tells his friends what a cunt she is.  She's just a fuck.  Well, dude, just deal with it, man.  Honey, can we talk? 
[01:55:30]  Well, listen, I was just shut the...  Ugh, shut the fuck up.  You know, can we play that scene?  Uh, Louis C.K. tweeted it, and it definitely works for radio.  Louis is doing his fucking act, and it shows how he deals with hecklers.  This really hot blonde.  This actually happened to him, somebody told me last night, like two weeks before this  happened.  This really happened.  True story, true story, true story.  Love the true story.  Here it is, yeah.  Even Louis C.K. tweeted it.  He knows this is a solid scene.  I went to a doctor recently, and he told me to eat slower. 
[01:56:00]  And I was like, why eat slower?  And he said, because your body gets full, but that message that your body's full takes  20 minutes to travel from your stomach to your brain.  It takes 20 minutes before you know that you've already been full for 20 minutes.  First of all, what a douchebag your body is, that it takes 20 minutes.  What's taking 20 minutes to get, if I stub my toe, I know it immediately, and that's 
[01:56:30]  twice the distance.  What is this message doing that it's, it like stops at my tit?  Hey, tit, what's up?  Hey, what are you doing?  I'm going to tell them that we're full.  Get up there, you idiot.  We're going to get huge if you don't tell them.  And, oh, well, excuse me.  I guess, yeah.  And then he goes off.  I'm not going yet.  And he goes down to my asshole.  He's like, hey, asshole, what are you doing?  My asshole's like.  That's how my asshole talks. 
[01:57:00]  I, I.  No, I'm going to go if you can.  Seriously.  Seriously.  Seriously.  Hi, could you stop talking because you're making it hard for me to do my job?  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  It's okay.  Just, you don't have to be sorry.  Just please don't do it anymore, okay?  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you. 
[01:57:30]  Uh, anyway.  Holy shit.  Um.  Why would this kiss me a little?  Sorry.  I was on a plane the other day and, uh, people on plane, you know when you're on a plane  and you're on the tarmac and you haven't, but you can't get to the gate because there's  a plane at your gate.  That's what happened to Mike the other day.  Excuse me?  No, Mike.  Well, Mike.  My friend, that happened to him, too.  I don't care.  Well, no, my friend Mike.  Hey, hey, hey. 
[01:58:00]  Nobody, nobody cares about your friend Mike.  Nobody cares about your friend Mike.  Okay.  Nobody cares about your friend Mike.  Okay, whatever.  It was funny.  What was funny?  Unlike you.  I'm sorry?  Oh.  I can't.  I said unlike you.  It was funny unlike me.  Yes.  Yes, I did.  Can I ask you a question?  Go ahead.  What happened to the, um, the parade?  What parade?  The parade of stupid f*** you were floating. 
[01:58:30]  I'm just curious.  Okay, that's not even funny.  It's not?  No.  Okay.  You sure?  All right.  No, you're offensive.  I'm offensive?  Yes.  What do you mean?  You're making jokes about rape, and that's offensive.  You don't like rape?  You don't?  No.  That's really weird, because you know that you wouldn't even exist if your mom hadn't raped  that homeless Chinese guy.  Oh, my God. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, my God.  However many years ago you were born.  No, listen.  I'm sorry.  I'm really...  It's hard to come back from that, but I am sorry.  I don't...  I didn't mean that.  Look, can you do me a favor?  What?  Can you please just die of AIDS?  Does anybody have AIDS who they could put their dick in her face and get her started on that? 
[01:59:30]  Anybody?  I could sue you.  What?  You could sue me?  Yeah.  You know who I would like to sue?  Everybody that works in the hospital that you were born at.  Because I would like to sue them for not responsibly pulling your head off the second...  Letting you live was medical malpractice.  Can't you just, like, move on?  No, I can't.  I really can't, because you're the worst thing that ever happened in America.  Seriously, it goes, you... 
[02:00:00]  slavery...  And then Pearl Harbor and 9-11 combined.  Those are the three.  And so, like, as an American, I feel like it's my duty to make you feel poorly.  And your mother's a whore.  Your mother's dead.  Your mother's dead?  Yeah.  That's good.  It is.  It is.  You know why?  Because she can't make any more c*** with her c***. 
[02:00:30]  You did not just call me a C word.  What's that?  Did you just call me a C word?  No, I called you a c***.  Because you're a c***.  And your mother is one.  And she had one.  You know, the moment you were being born, there was a guy walking by.  And you know what he said?  He said, hey, look.  Some c*** coming out of some c***.  That's the scene right there.  Fucking brilliant. 
[02:01:00]  God damn, Louie's great.  Amazing.  FX, Louie's new show.  No, Anthony has a different f***ing list.  It's not slavery first.  No, no, no.  I wouldn't put that there.  I'd put her.  Age limit.  Yeah, yeah.  Age of consent.  Louie on FX, Tuesdays at 11.  You were getting a little uncomfortable watching that, Bob Kelly.  It's too real, right?  It's not.  You know what it is?  Because they're not heckling.  And that's what the problem is.  People think a heckler is somebody yells shit out at you. 
[02:01:30]  Fuck you.  Blah, blah.  It's conversation is the worst heckling.  She's literally so f***ing captivated with her own f***ing voice.  It's like the same c*** that walks into a restaurant and doesn't have restaurant voice who just sits down.  So anyways, yeah, Gary's such a...  And you're like...  Yeah.  Do you see everybody else here f***ing whispering table restaurant talk?  Cell phone train.  The guy on the cell phone on the train also that has to just really let everyone in the car know what he's talking about. 
[02:02:00]  There's a way on the train to be like, hey, how you doing?  Yeah, I'm on the train.  You kind of cup the f***ing phone a little bit to amplify your voice into the phone.  Yeah.  You have to be like, yeah.  Talk like black guys on the cell phone.  Have her pull the Johnson file.  I'm going to be in, oh, about...  I should be landing at about...  You're on a train.  Shut up.  Don't say land.  Whenever you're in a car, a bus, or a train.  I like when people...  I'll be landing at about noon. 
[02:02:30]  Shut it.  You're on a bus.  And they got to let everyone know how important their job is.  Yeah.  These f***ing twats.  I f***ing hate them.  I actually made a...  In Houston, made the girls...  This is what happens is they talk.  They don't think they're heckling because they're talking to their friend at the table.  Yeah, yeah.  And then they go, I wasn't even saying anything.  I wasn't talking to you.  Yeah, I wasn't talking to you.  And then you say something like that back.  You trash them back.  Yeah, yeah.  And then they get offended.  Like, you're the f***ing asshole. 
[02:03:00]  It's my fault.  I wouldn't even have said it.  This girl was crying between an ATM.  Just like hunched over, crying.  Like, I just wanted to have fun.  All her friends left her and came back in.  And her boyfriend was like, she does this all the f***ing time.  And then he had to go out and deal with the f***ing drunk ass to shut up.  Oh, that episode made me so happy.  Yeah, you wouldn't have stopped the show if you didn't hear her, right?  No, I wouldn't even have talked to her.  What is it about stand-up comedy that isn't like a Broadway show or any other thing where you know you're just supposed to shut the f*** up? 
[02:03:30]  Probably because you're looking up and seeing me.  If it was just you, then I would say, yeah, okay.  Not Tom Cruise, who's captivating.  It's like every comic.  Like, why do people feel compelled that they could just start yapping and ruin everyone else's time?  Or think that they could add something by being funny?  Because it's a night out.  It's a night out.  You got the drinks in front of you with the cute little names.  You order a Dennis Leary and a Tracy Morgan.  You can do that. 
[02:04:00]  Tracy Morgan's just heroin.  Do that on Broadway.  It's a day I'm fucking yelling at the stage.  Mozzarella sticks.  Yeah, but Broadway, you're not drinking exactly.  Eating mozzarella sticks.  When the clubs added fucking fried food and cute names for their drinks, you feel like you're just kind of hanging.  You look down on the table, you see a fucking chocolate fuck me cake.  Watch me.  Watch me with this guy.  And tiramisu.  Watch me with this guy.  I fucking, hold on.  I tell you what.  I'm going to get him watched.  I tell you what, it's not usually, especially O&A fans, guys, it's not usually guys. 
[02:04:30]  It's exactly that chick.  It's that white girl who's never been told, hey, you're an idiot.  You're a fucking dumb cunt.  Yeah.  You know, my wife got the shit kicked out of her by another girl at one point.  Like a girl was like, fuck you.  And they fought.  She, like, I've been beat up.  I've been knocked out.  I know when to shut the fuck up.  There's that thing where you're like, dude, just, you know what, Bobby, shut the fuck up.  Or else we're going to have to go further with this.  So you think girls would, or women would behave if they got knocked out once? 
[02:05:00]  Not knocked out.  Think about it, though.  I mean, think about how great it was.  We've all been in a situation where you're like, oh, fuck, I'm in deep shit here.  But it makes you think the next time.  Think of the old days when the guy, you know, could at least make him flinch.  You know what I mean?  Where's dinner?  I was, yeah, and he brings his hand back.  It's coming.  It's coming.  Too many women walk through life thinking they're superheroes.  You know what I mean?  They're untouchable.  That's the problem.  It's like, I can do whatever you can do. 
[02:05:30]  All right, well, carry all the groceries, bitch.  I'm going to walk home.  Here's 90 bags that you've got to hold on one finger.  You want to talk to a heckler?  This guy heckles at all the shows.  No.  Why would you even want to talk to him?  Nathan, why do you heckle comedians at shows all the time?  One of the reasons is because nine times out of ten,  I'm funnier than the comedian who has 30 years experience on stage.  That's what you think.  Then why aren't you doing it?  Yeah, why don't you just go do comedy then, dude?  Just go and fucking do the hard work and be a comic and make some money. 
[02:06:00]  What do you do for a living?  The other issue is I paid my money, so I can go there and grandstand as much as I want.  Oh, God.  This idiot.  What do you do for a living, sir?  What do I do for a living?  Yeah.  Don't repeat the question thinking of something.  I know.  I take grounds up for septic tanks.  So you'd rather do that than be a really funny comic?  Because you're saying you're funnier than all the guys you see.  Yes.  Wouldn't it be a better life being a stand-up comic? 
[02:06:30]  Well, what happens is...  Basically, it would be, but obviously you would not make it.  Yeah, interrupt me.  You know, what I have to say is less important than what you've got to say.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Wow.  You better frunk us this call or you are truly the biggest douche.  No, I can't believe you fucking guys put me on.  I'll tell you that much.  Yeah.  You're not from Philly, are you?  It took you five fucking seconds to put me on.  Unbelievable.  What are you getting at? 
[02:07:00]  Huh?  Is it a goof call?  I still don't even know.  Huh?  Huh?  Is this a goof call?  Yeah.  You're a goof.  Oh.  That's some of his great material.  Is he for real, though?  Does anyone know?  I don't know.  I think he might have been.  See, that's a guy.  That's a guy.  You know what I was thinking of today?  I was reading reviews on the Internet of people.  Like, you know, all this.  Like, back in the day, even to be a stalker, to kill somebody, you had to, like, climb a wall. 
[02:07:30]  You had to fucking go through security and all just to fucking ruin somebody's life.  Now you can just go and hurt their feelings on Amazon.  Yeah.  You can just go and say, he's a piece of shit.  Or Colin, this fucking.  That's another guy who's never been knocked out.  Never.  Never been woke up next to your tire.  Let's go to Bob in Iowa.  Fucking asshole.  Bob, what's going on? 
[02:08:00]  Hey, what's going on, boy?  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  I actually witnessed Bobby, I actually witnessed him smashing three 35-year-old cunts at the Funny Bone in West Des Moines.  I don't know if you remember it, Bobby, but this girl in the front row kept saying, oh, snap.  And you were like, can you shut the fuck up?  You know why I don't remember?  Because I did it in Columbus like four days ago.  Oh, really?  Yeah. 
[02:08:30]  There's these three, you know, people go to comedy shows and expecting a fucking puppet or like, you know, old school comedy.  And then you get up there and you start saying a couple of things.  And you look down and you see that face.  You know, they can smell dog shit, but they don't know where it is.  Just disapproving of every word, which I don't mind.  You can just sit there, but once you start talking, I actually like seeing a fucking disappointed face.  I know I'm actually saying something good if that cunt doesn't like me.  Yeah, she don't like you.  Oh, yeah.  If you like me, there's something wrong, but I don't remember that one. 
[02:09:00]  But, yeah, I've done it a bunch of times.  I did it in Houston.  I fucking snapped on this kid and then he wouldn't leave.  That's what I don't get either is just fucking leave.  Yeah, you don't like it?  I paid my money.  Well, now you're going to sit here and not enjoy yourself because you paid your money.  Just leave.  Cut your losses.  Get the fuck out.  Where West?  What club was it?  West Des Moines.  Where the fuck was I in West Des Moines?  It's a funny boy, man.  I was the kid that you called a skinny bitch and I told you I lost 100 pounds.  You told me I was a liar. 
[02:09:30]  Were you lying?  Do you remember this guy, Bobby?  Well, good for you for losing 100 pounds, dude.  I gained fucking 50 back.  Yeah, and the thing was about going back to these broads, they were in line trying to  get something signed and you looked at this girl and you're like, I'm sorry, just shut  the fuck up.  It wasn't your show.  It was my show.  It was good.  I don't know if you like the funny bone or not.  You were wearing your cupcake and crossbones t-shirt. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  You really were fucking checking me out, dude.  Really?  Good witness.  I'm a fan.  I'm a fan, man.  No, thanks, brother.  I do it all the fucking time, dude.  It happens all the time because the clubs now, too, they give the security job to save  money to a waitress.  Yeah, she's like fucking 4'2".  She weighs 80 pounds.  She's going to start throwing people out.  Yeah, dude.  There was actually one where I'm flipping out and then there was some O&A fans came.  I mean, these guys were gorillas.  They were fucking, like, could seriously hurt somebody. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  And this guy, I was kind of, they were cool, though.  They were fucking guys.  They were laughing, having a good time.  They were fucking around a little bit.  And I talked to them.  And the security guard, because the weekend was so fucked up, was on edge.  So he went up to them and went, look.  And it was a racial thing because this was like a big old redneck white boy with an accent.  And this guy was a black dude, like really black guy.  And he went up, hey, if you talk again.  And this guy, I just saw him.  And he was just fucking, he was about to snap and take the whole class. 
[02:11:00]  I had to go over to him and go, hey, bro, listen, I'm going to say, just please, everything's cool, man.  Everything's all right.  No need to just rip someone's fucking head off.  He was like, this motherfucker.  I was, fuck, Bobby, I came here to, I know it's an O&A fan when they call me Bobby.  Yeah.  Now Bobby.  Yeah, I came here to enjoy you and that motherfucker.  Bobby.  Emphasizes that.  I came here to see Bobby.  All right, let's move on.  And we got that, oh, we got the Sherry Shepard first, Anthony. 
[02:11:30]  That's where we were.  Yes.  We went off-roading a little bit, talked to Earl, and then Jimmy left, and now Bobby's here.  So now we're back on track.  Sherry Shepard on The View.  You still have that, Travis?  You want to play both of them, man?  I want to hear the world is, she doesn't know the world's fucking round.  I know that.  All right, let's start with that one.  Sherry Shepard is dope from The View.  Is the world flat?  Is the world flat?  Yes.  I don't know.  What do you think?  I never thought about it, Whoopi. 
[02:12:00]  Is the world flat?  I never thought about it.  You never thought about whether the world was round or flat?  No, because I, but I'll tell you what I've thought about, how I'm going to feed my child.  How I'm going to take care of my family.  The world, is the world flat has never entered into, that has not been an important thing to me.  You'll teach your son, Jeffrey, right?  If my son, Jeffrey, asked me if the world flat, I guess I will go.  You know, didn't come up with that?  My bus already worked this question out.  I mean, why are we doing this?  What a fucking dummy.  She's an embarrassment to women.  Human beings.  What a dummy.  I mean, Barbara Walters, you know, she's got some credibility and she hires a broad that 
[02:12:30]  doesn't know that the earth, she thinks the earth is flat.  Is that some religious thing, though?  But it's too scared to say that.  Is that a religious, she was trying to catch her in some religion?  Is it the earth on the back of a tortoise or something?  The back of a tortoise, yes.  It's in the sea monsters.  Yeah, I'm serious.  It's some kind of old fucking, yeah.  The world is flat and it rests on the back of a tortoise.  Yeah, that was, yes, people actually thought that.  What the fuck is that?  Yes.  Oldie time things they thought for like a thousand years and then someone said, don't be stupid. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, some kind of fable.  Yeah.  It's one of those dumb fables.  The flat earth.  I wonder if I'd be one of those guys to believe that shit, though, like back in the day.  It's so, what's great is the whole thing that she almost pulls that Chris Rock thing.  Right.  I take care of my kids.  You're supposed to.  You know, that shit is fucking great.  She tries to divert the whole thing by going, but I'll tell you what I do.  I take care of my kids and stuff.  Well, that's good.  Yeah, great.  There's plenty of room in your brain to fucking think about if the world is flat and take care of your kids. 
[02:13:30]  And put some dinner on the table.  And put your nipple in his fucking mouth.  And how about you educate yourself so if your kid asks you a fucking question, you could give him an answer.  You dunce.  You fucking dolt.  She's representing women.  Well, women.  Women.  She's representing women.  Women.  Women like olives, girl.  Women.  Women today.  I'm tired all week.  I suck.  Oh, and then she talks about how old you think the earth is, Bob Kelly. 
[02:14:00]  It's got to be fucking.  A real answer.  Fucking four billion years.  You would go with billions easily, right?  Anthony, would you go with billions easily?  Yeah, of course.  You're in the billions.  We should get a Michu Kaku.  I love that guy.  How have they proven that the earth is.  How about we just say.  Oh, yeah.  You're losing interest in it.  I am.  But he gets going.  Because some of these people think the earth is only 2,000.  Earl thinks 6,000.  6,000 years old. 
[02:14:30]  Some people think about 3,000.  And they think.  What's wrong?  Fucking plain yogurt tastes like if you got the fucking talc and put it on your balls  and then scraped it off at the end of the day and just ate it.  Clean yogurt is useless.  It's the fucking worst thing on the planet.  They got fat-free yogurt with flavoring in it.  Get one of those.  Yeah.  They have fucking.  You can get like a fucking cream to mint and fucking blueberries.  Key lime.  Fucking women.  Something tasty.  Key lime.  You're winning.  Key lime.  Fat-free.  I got creamsicle the other night.  You know what they have?  Honey bun yogurt now. 
[02:15:00]  Honey bun.  Tastes like a honey bun.  Wow.  That's fucked up.  Never liked honey.  I like vanilla shit.  Not honey.  Honey bun.  I gotcha.  The creamy part of the bun.  Oh, okay.  I like vanilla.  Ugh.  Vanilla's good.  I take that.  Good stuff.  So now we go to Sherry Shepard.  There's a bunch of people out there that believe what Sherry Shepard believes as far as the age of  the earth.  You got that clip, Travis?  Keep in mind that probably when he was around, there was no Jesus Christ stuff going on.  No, no.  They still had Christians back then.  I don't want to think they're.  I mean, they had their gods.  The Greeks. 
[02:15:30]  The Greeks.  They had Christians.  They had Christians and they had.  I'm doing the outshot thing now.  They had Christians and they threw them to the lions.  I think this might predate that.  I think this might predate that.  I don't think anything predated Christians.  No, no, no.  That's all the right.  The Greeks came first.  Yes.  The Greeks were first.  Then the Romans.  Then the Christians.  Jesus came first before them.  So I.  No.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Not on paper.  Okay.  Not on paper.  Okay.  Yeah.  I don't want to turn this to a really good thing.  It doesn't matter anyway.  They didn't believe in Jesus. 
[02:16:00]  They believed in polytheism.  Many gods.  You know.  Wait.  But is that the clip we usually play?  She thinks that nothing predates Jesus.  Yeah.  She did.  But how did it?  But they proved that Jesus was a man walking the earth.  Yeah.  But how about the people that came to him as a baby?  They were adults.  Well, they.  How did.  No.  No.  They were just poof.  They were there.  Three wise men just came.  Jesus was born.  With full afros and beards.  Totally.  That's right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Really?  I have no idea what this lunatic is saying.  No.  I really don't know. 
[02:16:30]  All right.  Well.  There's no logic.  They can never explain it.  They can never explain what science has come up with.  How like that.  Bobby just said a perfect thing.  Like what about the people that were there just the day before Jesus was born?  Yeah.  But not even that.  What about the gifts?  Who made the gifts?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What happened?  Nothing predates Jesus.  Maybe she may give or take a few years.  Give or take 20 years.  I don't know what she's talking about.  Fuck the idiot.  Dummy.  Dummy.  It leads to yesterday.  These idiots talking about old lesbians. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  There is a rise, speaking of Christina, in late blooming lesbians.  More and more women are choosing same sex partners, even after decades of heterosexuality.  Why do you think that is?  Is that saying as women get older, it's just like a been there, done that kind of thing?  And I'm open to it.  No.  I'll tell you what's happening.  All the older men are going for younger women, leaving the women with no one.  So that's why they're suddenly sleeping with women?  That's ridiculous.  I'm sorry.  Well, I don't mean that you've... 
[02:17:30]  So there's a rise, though.  I'm saying, if you're searching for someone, a people-level intelligence...  Then what does that say about me?  If the men are evacuating for these younger women, maybe you just want to come here?  As soon as you go to get another woman, we'll know what about you.  She won't do that.  These broads are just stupid.  Just cackling.  They just sound like...  Not every older guy is going for a younger woman.  There's got to be one out there that isn't.  There's only one in here that is.  No.  Two.  Three.  Three.  Four. 
[02:18:00]  Four.  Five.  Six.  But that turns women gay later in their lives?  Because there's no men left.  So they say, what the fuck?  Or they've been in marriages for so long, and it's gotten so dull that when the marriage  ends, either because she's a widow or a divorcee, that they just give up on the cock and decide...  Yeah, but it's so easy to...  For some reason, I don't know why, it's so easy to fucking be a lesbian.  Like, it's...  But you're just licking some...  Taking a couple swipes.  Doing some scissoring.  Well, it goes... 
[02:18:30]  And you're fucking hanging out baking for the rest of the day.  It's kind of fun.  But it goes with the whole thing is gay, something you're born with,  or something that is learned, or something...  Now, with men, I absolutely believe you are born gay, if you're a man, and you're gay.  Right.  You are fucking born that way.  There's just no way that voice comes out of you.  You can't make that shit up.  You can't get bored with women, or not get women, and then just say...  It's just too aggressive. 
[02:19:00]  How do they know that at three years old...  I knew when he was three that he was gay, and it was a...  For me, you fucking did that.  If we'd fight, we'd probably beat each other up.  Yes.  Well, and I think it's more about sex, especially young gay.  The young gay, it's a lot more about sex.  I don't know why we compared me and you, like I had a fantasy about that.  But now, older women they're talking about, if they're turning gay, I think it's a lot  more for the companionship than it is scissoring fucking 60-year-olds rubbing those dried fucking 
[02:19:30]  pussies together.  But you get older, it doesn't mean you have to lick the pussy, right?  No, I'm not talking about the licking the pussy.  They could just get a fucking roommate.  But I think that's what it is.  Like, when they say turning to lesbianism, I think their life partners are now women,  but they're not fucking licking gash every night.  They're just companions.  They're watching movies.  They're rubbing each other's leg, maybe, on the couch.  They're leaning their head on the fucking shoulder-type thing.  But it's just companionship. 
[02:20:00]  You know it's probably like that fucking...  You know when meat goes wrong, it gets that rainbow on it?  Like that...  Oh, God.  And it's harder.  It's like rubbery meat.  You turn it the right way, and you see that rainbow.  Yeah, like that fucking chimp-asshole.  It's like Arby's roast beef.  Shit.  Old pussy.  They have to scissor.  I don't even get scissor.  You're just mushing your pussies together?  They just smash them together.  You get like two fucking suction cups? 
[02:20:30]  They just smash them together.  What if it makes a fart sound if you catch it just right?  Oh, it's got to, right?  Like suction cups.  It'd be great if two women connected their pussy and asshole together,  and they got stuck together.  Pop them apart.  There's a scissor.  There's some hot scissoring for you.  Now is there a problem with scissoring there?  Yeah.  You have a problem with that?  Bobby, look at that.  Bobby, do you?  Dude, I don't give a fuck if they were murdering cattle.  That is great.  Can we see old women scissoring?  Now I think we finally stumped Danny.  There's no way you're going to find old women scissoring.  Oh, look at him thinking.  He's thinking, what's the type of thing? 
[02:21:00]  Danny will find anything.  Danny's great at the web search.  Old grandma good.  Grandma scissoring.  It's going to be a quilt.  Grandma scissoring.  She's going to be making a quilt.  Yeah, we're not going to see old women scissoring, I don't think.  Grandma pussy scissoring or old lady scissoring?  Nothing.  No.  Nothing scissoring.  I'll find it.  That's a tough one.  I think Danny will find it.  I have all the faith in the world.  Absolutely.  Same here. 
[02:21:30]  How about just pussies stuck together?  Fat lips.  Old, skanky, fucking nasty lips.  Gray hair.  Have you seen gray hair on a pussy?  No.  No.  The hair.  It gets all like hard and coarse.  Coarse?  Really?  Yeah.  It has no more root.  You just pull it out and it's just straight hair.  It's too easy to pull out.  Yeah, you can actually just rub it, just like mush it off.  Oh, shit.  And it would just come off like in there.  Oh, shit. 
[02:22:00]  I actually like older women, though.  I like the fucking...  You like gray pussy hair?  Dude, there was a movie where, I don't know what it was called, where this retard was in  this Italian retard and this old Italian woman wound up just sucking his cock just to piss  off her husband.  Wow.  And he caught her doing it and he beat the shit out of her.  But she was just like, come here, just take it out.  It's just an old Italian woman with those big, fat nipples and the...  I don't know.  Something about that.  No.  Nothing about that.  I like that. 
[02:22:30]  I like that.  I like the old woman.  Not old, but like 50.  Really?  Ah.  Where their ass is like kind of nice, but it gets flat down the bottom.  Mall thief gets tackled by local cheerleader.  Hmm.  That's a hot story.  Well, what have we got here?  Breaking on Fox News.  Well, hello.  So you're the cheerleader, are you?  What are you...  What are you doing to me?  Look at her.  Aw.  I guess Fox has nothing to talk about today. 
[02:23:00]  Did some backflips and fucking landed on top of them.  Yeah.  Cheerleader.  Danny just keeps coming up with these...  A lot of dead ends.  I hate when you go to Google Images and you click and it takes you to some fucking web  page that you gotta sign up for.  Does the pussy get, like, bigger as you get older?  I would think gravity would take its toll, so it would start looking...  Even on the pussy?  It would start looking like an old fucking bulldog mouth.  Stuff starts...  You can't quite shut it.  Stuff starts falling out from the inside, too.  Yeah. 
[02:23:30]  No.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  There's an old granny sucking a big black cock.  I wouldn't let her fucking suck my cock.  Oh, yes.  If I was delivering pizza and I came across that and she was just in a chair with, like,  a half a titty hanging out, I'd fucking...  She's got big old women tits, too.  I wouldn't eat...  I wouldn't go near a pussy, but I'd let her fucking suck it.  That is just not right.  Oh, man.  No, come on.  That's bullshit.  Starts looking like a tongue.  That can't be real.  I don't know.  That's not real.  No, I think that shit is real.  I can't be real.  I think that's what starts happening.  That can't be real.  Just falls down like that?  I think so, yep. 
[02:24:00]  It looks like a bear's mouth when they go like...  Just the corners?  That lip starts going down like that.  Oh, man.  See, I'd let her fucking blow me.  I wouldn't go near that.  But that's...  Can I just say something, though?  30 years ago, all pussies looked like that.  No, not like that.  Before they started trimming...  Dude, before they started bikini waxing assholes on the side...  Yeah, that looks like a shotgun blast with hair around it.  They at least were tightened up.  There was hair on it, but...  What was it? 
[02:24:30]  It was tightened up.  There was hair all on it.  That thing is all big and nasty stretch, like a bunch of kids dropped through it.  Oof.  Is that what happens after your kid comes out?  Is it fuck-up your pussy?  I never saw a fucking pussy that a kid came through.  Never saw one.  Everything's good?  Not in my life.  Not now.  Not never.  Get pussy reconstruction surgery.  Fucking send my wife right back in there.  Set up the scaffolding.  Fix that.  Fix that.  Fix that.  Fix it. 
[02:25:00]  I'm trying to get her to do a C-section.  Yeah?  Yeah.  If she gets pregnant and we're going to have a baby, I'm begging her to just pull it out  of her stomach.  You want the scar there, though?  I don't give a shit about a scar.  Would you rather have a scar or a huge, fucked-up pussy?  Let me think.  Neither.  You don't want kids?  No.  Anthony doesn't want the kids, no.  You'll adopt somebody.  You'll adopt somebody someday.  No.  It's not going to adopt.  You will adopt.  Young Taiwanese girl.  The little Woody Allen action.  Have my way with. 
[02:25:30]  A concubine.  Well, we're going to.  Just have her follow you like 12 paces behind you around your house all the time.  Binder feet.  Yeah.  And we're going to take a break.  We're going to get into some other things after the break.  Certainly.  I don't know how to give this one away or tease it, but Sam's been doing some investigating,  some P.I. work around SiriusXM.  Is that what it's called, or is it called nosy, can't keep his fucking shit out of other 
[02:26:00]  people's shit, Sam?  But God bless him for it, right?  Thank God for it.  Okay, good.  Yeah, he's been doing some P.I. work.  I got no problem with it, but let's call it what it is.  Let's call a spade a half of whatever.  We got some creepy stuff going down.  Yeah.  We got some creepy stuff going on.  And Sam is going to expose that next.  It's definitely creepy.  And Bob Kelly in studio, he's heading to Philly right after the show.  He's got a show tonight at Helium Comedy Club, and then two on Friday and two on Saturday.  HeliumComedy.com.  Get your tickets in advance. 
[02:26:30]  Bobby hasn't been to Philly in a while.  No, I haven't.  Very funny.  And so, my fellow Americans.  Blah, blah, blah.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show on the Virus Sirius XM.  Bob Kelly in studio.  Helium Comedy Club.  Tonight, Friday and Saturday.  Make sure you see Bobby.  Yeah, I follow him on Twitter.  Robert Kelly on Twitter.  You got some good tweets there, Bobby.  You got a picture of some old man yesterday. 
[02:27:00]  That was the best.  He looks like the king of the court, by the way.  And why am I going to say...  I guess I should continue saying, by the way.  Boy the way.  Boy the way.  Boy the way, because I don't say it enough.  Boy the way.  And you said you're looking at your future?  Well, you know, I love going down the...  If you just go down the village and just watch these fucking weirdos that just walk by.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  These fucking creepers.  Like 110 degrees out.  And this old jackass has like nine sweatbands on each wrist. 
[02:27:30]  He's walking with a baseball bat and a stick.  He's got Jimmy Norton glasses on.  It's fucking terrible.  And nobody says anything.  It's just...  It's normal.  Anywhere else in the country, they'd be like...  The cops would be called.  Yeah.  Just to check out the guy.  Make sure he's okay.  Nobody says a fucking thing.  You're absolutely right.  Hey, that show you were watching last night.  We stopped you.  During the break, Bobby's telling us this crazy story.  I guess there's a new show on TV called Monsters Inside.  It's called The Monsters Inside.  And the fucking...  What channel? 
[02:28:00]  ...animation.  You know?  It's on...  Because people would probably want to check something out.  I think it's on Animal Planet.  Is it?  I was going to...  A travel channel or Animal Planet.  Either one of those, I think it is.  I see the commercials for that, and it makes me not want to watch it, because I know I'll  start to have anxiety.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll think I have it.  The actual...  The animation they show at the beginning of the show is like...  It's your insides, and then it shows this almost like a fucking stingray type of micro  fucking animal organism.  Organism.  Organism.  Organism.  Organism.  Just going over your fucking organs and fucking attacking your cells. 
[02:28:30]  That's beautiful.  It's all about these little micro fucking monsters with...  They're fucking alien monsters.  I mean, these things have...  Like, this one last night, this lady had on her inner thigh.  She thought it was a heat rash.  Then she thought...  She went to the doctor.  They said poison oak.  In reality, it was a fucking monster in her fucking belly that would shoot out... 
[02:29:00]  It had a horn that came out of its mouth that shot little eggs out of it.  Stop it.  I swear to God.  It shoots eggs out of that, and the eggs actually came out of her fucking piss onto her leg and  attacked them.  The cord, my fucking headphone cord just rubbed against my arm and freaked me out.  You fucking assholes.  This is worse than a horror film.  Holy shit.  And these little things were on the outside of her body, inner skin now, fucking, like, 
[02:29:30]  outside of her body.  The one I watched, doesn't it, freaked me out so bad.  Now, wait, can I slow you down for a second?  Please do.  Now, you look at these tiny organisms in your body and stuff.  Why can't they be the aliens?  Why do we always have to look at aliens as the image we all kind of throw in our brains  as soon as you think aliens?  What if we're the aliens to them, and they're attacking us like we're attacking other people?  Well, why can't these be aliens?  Yeah, dude, we...  These fucking things, when you see...  They are aliens, man.  They live in you.  There's living things inside you that you have no control over. 
[02:30:00]  Look at that.  It just fucking multiplies into it.  A tapeworm.  This guy, that's a tapeworm, which is actually segmented.  But the ringworm, this guy last night, dude, he came back from Iraq.  He had stomach problems, so he started doing a cleanse, like a vegetable cleanse for three months.  Around two months in, he's in bed.  He gets stomach cramps.  He wakes up to go to the bathroom.  He thought he shit himself.  And then all of a sudden, he felt something slapping his inner thighs. 
[02:30:30]  What is it?  What?  He reached down to his ass, and something was hanging out of his asshole.  What a trout?  What the fuck is this?  It was just shit.  This is sick.  It was just a hard shit.  He grabbed the end of it.  It was alive.  No way.  No way.  He pulled a fucking nine-inch worm out of his asshole.  Okay?  Was it attached to a man?  It's not...  That's called a cock. 
[02:31:00]  He pulled it out.  It was in his hand, moving.  It was still alive.  That is horror movie shit.  And then he called his wife to show his wife, which I don't...  If I pull the worm out of my asshole, I'm not telling anybody except the doctor.  I'm not going to call my wife over, because I'd never...  You'd call your wife over if you have a nice shit in the toilet.  Why not if you have a worm?  What do you mean?  I'd leave it in for.  There you go.  I know.  But a worm...  I think you've got to show the world.  Fuck that.  A nine-inch worm. 
[02:31:30]  Nine-inch worm.  Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve.  Oh, yeah.  And this is the problem.  If you have one, they lay eggs.  So he went to the dogs, he goes, look, you have one that's nine inches, which means you  probably have a lot more.  I'd drink Drano.  I would just drink fucking Drano and take my chances.  Imagine pulling up, feeling something like an eel slapping in your inner thighs.  There's maggots in his head.  I'm not watching this.  I'm not watching this.  There's maggots in his head.  Making noises, and it's moving.  Oh, that's the one... 
[02:32:00]  Oh, they get video of that.  That's fucked up.  Aaron Dallas is a ski instructor in Carbondale, Colorado.  In the spring of 2007, something stops Aaron in his tracks.  It was planting time, and as I was bending over to shovel, I felt this sharp pain in the  back of my head.  As I bent down, it got worse and worse.  A week later, he begins to feel the skin on the back of his head is changing. 
[02:32:30]  What?  I started to discover there were some distinct bumps on the back of my head.  Aaron can feel a ring of five individual bumps protruding from the back of his head.  Oh, my God.  As I'm lying in bed one night, I can hear noises in the back of my head.  Oh, my God!  I can hear the bumps making noise.  Just a very faint scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch.  I woke my wife up, and I said, you've got to see it.  It's making noises, and it's moving. 
[02:33:00]  I took a shower right before I went to the doctor and went with wet hair to see the doctor.  He parts my hair, looks at the bump, and pauses.  He goes, oh, my God.  What is it?  What do you see?  What is it?  And he says, I don't know.  All I can see are things moving inside the bumps on the back of your head.  Fuck you!  You know what I mean?  They're bot flies.  The bot fly is a hairy insect about twice the size of a house fly. 
[02:33:30]  Its maggot larvae are known to live as parasites in human flesh.  Fuck you!  Get out of here!  Stop it!  I'm not going crazy, that there really are things moving and making noise on the back of my head.  Aaron's head has been a nursery to five growing bot flies.  Skin provides food and shelter for baby bot flies.  Goddamn motherfucker!  I don't like to use the word maggots because it's not a very nice word, and it doesn't make me feel very good that there were maggots in my head. 
[02:34:00]  But what he showed me were maggots.  Why would anyone watch this?  Fucked up.  A high school senior.  Oh no, what does she have?  Dude.  A high school senior.  What does she got, stuff in her eyes?  Woke up with a big Italian cock in her vagina.  Nice.  You want to do one more?  We got to know what happens to the high school senior. 
[02:34:30]  And then we got Dr. Steve on the line.  Is it sexy?  Do you want to know?  Look at her face.  There's no way what she has is sexy.  She's humiliated her.  No, she really doesn't look happy.  A school senior.  Holds victim to a veiled attacker.  Oh.  It was an actual creature.  A living creature in my eyes.  I don't want this.  I can't get this.  Please, God, don't give this to me.  Stop being racist and we won't do it. 
[02:35:00]  Mallory has tickets to see her favorite blue band.  God agrees with me.  The lights are bothering me at the concert.  It really feels like there is something in my eye, but in so much pain, and it's just  very irritating.  When the concert ends, the pain continues.  I hate this.  I got this.  I don't want this.  Before then, she wakes up to spend her first day as a senior.  The eye was in so much more extreme pain than the night before. 
[02:35:30]  I'd call out for my mom.  She comes running in to see if I'm okay.  The only thing I can do is just hold my eye and...  Her brown eye.  ...and hit her to the point where I was just...  I had to make a joke.  It's killing me.  Concerned about her condition, Mallory's mother, Marsha, takes her to see a local ophthalmologist.  Oh.  On the eye surface on the pictures, it looks like little white clumps of dots.  He says that the dots are, in fact, a parasite that is living in my eye. 
[02:36:00]  Just laying out.  A way of penetrating the skin layer and then getting deeper into the cornea and basically  setting it a shot.  No!  So they were basically looking for a home and also for food.  Not in your eye.  This parasitic infection is called acanthamoeba keratitis.  The parasite can damage the eye so badly that Mallory could lose her cornea, her sight, and  eventually the eyeball itself.  Oh, they eat your eye. 
[02:36:30]  I don't want that.  I don't mind the eating part.  It's the laying eggs.  Everything lays eggs.  There's no way I would watch that show.  I'm not food.  I don't want to be food for something.  Let's talk to Dr. Steve.  Oh.  Dr. Steve, parasites.  Hey, boys.  Growing in your body.  Jesus.  Monsters Inside, the show on Animal Plan.  You watch it?  Yeah.  We actually did a segment on weird medicine about parasites and had the bot fly guy. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, really?  With the maggots in the back of his head making noises?  Yeah.  You go on vacation to Belize and you have a nice time.  You drink a few parachute or umbrella drinks and you come back with maggots growing under  the skin of your skull.  It's lovely.  And they can live there for, you know, quite some time, you know, and they're just gestating  and they're ready to turn into bot flies.  And the fly crawls out of your head. 
[02:37:30]  No, they have to actually cover the hole because it will suffocate and that's how they get it  out.  Am I right?  Yes.  Or they can be removed surgically.  If you just got a couple of them, they can just go in, numb it up and, you know, make  an incision and yank the thing.  I would need it out immediately.  I couldn't live knowing they're still in my head.  It's like, oh, we'll let them suffocate for a day or two.  No, I'd be running around screaming. 
[02:38:00]  Exactly.  Well, we had a girl, and sorry, I'm in a farewell, so I'm walking upstairs to my office.  We had a girl that called in that had blowfly maggots growing in her sinuses.  Blowfly.  Those are those big, like, nasty fucking black flies, right?  Yeah, yeah.  And she had them growing in her sinuses, and they were there for weeks and had to be removed. 
[02:38:30]  How'd that happen?  She had a cat who had a wound on its skin.  And then the blowflies had laid eggs in the cat's wound, and then the cat slept with her  at night.  And then the stupid maggots got into her nose because the cat was sleeping with her, so.  Holy shit, they're showing.  All right, hold on, Steve.  So I was going to wait until today.  Could you go back?  Because she got back from Belize.  This shit is happening in Belize there, Dr. Steve. 
[02:39:00]  Who's going to Belize?  I'm never going to Belize.  Go to Disney.  The Epcot fucking thing is just like going around the world without the blowflies in your  head.  I've been back from Belize for about.  Yeah, I just saw it.  Oh, God.  He saw it.  I see it.  No, what?  You see it's in my head?  Yeah, I think I see something.  Oh, my God.  Do you want me to get it?  How can you get it?  What are you going to do?  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  I want to be able to see it coming out with the camera. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  Hold on a second.  Maybe we'll get the tripod.  She's filming it as the boyfriend looks in the back of her head.  Well, I've been back from Belize for about a month now, and recently I noticed a strange  oozing bump on the back of my head.  This is different.  And finally, I went to the doctor yesterday, and they confirmed what I was most afraid  of.  It's a bot fly larva living and eating inside my head.  Fuck!  So I was going to wait until today to have them take it out. 
[02:40:00]  But all night I've not been able to sleep because I swear I felt it and heard it even  chewing on my head.  And so now we actually see it, and we're going to try to get it out.  Luckily, when we were in Belize, the locals told us how to get rid of a bot fly if one  decided to use you as its host.  Their method was to fill an empty beer bottle with smoke, then put the bottle over the bot  fly's breathing hole to basically smoke it out.  Anything? 
[02:40:30]  Oh, fuck.  The human bot fly's method of reproduction is actually pretty fascinating.  They use another organism, the mosquito, to transport their eggs, a practice known as  foracy.  Bitches.  Oh, God.  The adult lays its eggs on a mosquito.  When the mosquito lands on a person to feed, body heat triggers the eggs to hatch.  The larvae then bore into the person's skin and feed there for about a month. 
[02:41:00]  If allowed to finish their life cycle, they'll simply come out on their own when they're ready  to pupate.  But most people, myself included, can't wait that long.  Oh, my God.  Well, that didn't work, so it looks like we'll have to wait until my doctor's appointment.  Luckily, it's only a few hours away, so I think I can wait until then.  You got a maggot in your head.  Yeah.  You think she's going to sleep until the doctor's appointment?  I'd make her sleep in the garage.  32 hours later?  Well, the doctor wasn't able to get the bot fly larva out of my head yesterday. 
[02:41:30]  What?  It was just holding on too tightly to my scalp.  So what they did was they shaved this part of my hair and put a piece of tape over the  larva's breathing hole in the hopes that it would suffocate and die and then release its  grip.  So sure enough, I haven't felt it move since last night, and even a little bit of it is  sticking out.  Oh, fuck me, man.  So I'm hoping that we can take this tape off and finally pull this maggot out of my head. 
[02:42:00]  So let's try it.  I'm going to throw up.  I think I'm going to.  It sounds like the girl who ate the screaming hot dog.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  There we go.  We see the tip of the bag.  It's stuck.  And now the boyfriend's going to attempt to pull it out.  I would dump her.  Oh.  Oh, she is so fucking damaged.  I would dump her in a second.  He's got tweezers.  Wow.  He's holding on to it.  Look at that.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, shit.  Son of a bitch.  I don't even feel it. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, he's like, oh, God.  Oh, wait.  He's holding.  Oh, God.  He's holding from the other end as the boyfriend tries to pull it out with the tweezers.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I can't buy them.  Just yank it.  Yank.  He's like, is it out?  No, it's not out.  Halfway, dummy.  Is he moving?  No.  Don't snip it off, stupid.  Just if you feel resistance, don't keep pulling.  Why?  Just yank it.  Because if half of it will be in there.  Oh, God, that hurts.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  He's out?  Holy shit. 
[02:43:00]  All right.  Is it bleeding?  All right.  All right.  Pause this for a second.  How big is that?  Holy.  There goes Bobby.  Bobby's lost.  Why does it always end with him puking?  We didn't even want him to puke today.  There was green pulse.  Green.  Oh, fuck you.  Dude, but we don't, but we're not purposely doing this.  That's the beauty. 
[02:43:30]  I didn't know this.  Oh, Bobby's all red and sweaty again.  We don't need to do this to you every time you're on the show.  Dude, it was bad enough when the magnets started coming out, but then at the base.  Can we back up?  I was distracted by Bobby running to the guards, though.  Green.  Green pus.  Oh, that was fucking.  How big was it?  Oh, fuck, that's nasty, dude. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, that was so disgusting.  I don't mind the blood, whatever that shit.  But then the green, drippy, oozy stuff that came out of the hole.  The pussy stuff.  That was, oh, what the fuck?  Yeah.  I would dump that.  I would never touch that bitch again.  How would you ever go down on her?  I would never go up, down, sideways on that fucking.  How big was that, do you think?  That was like a regular maggot.  That was like a. 
[02:44:30]  No, I know, but I'm trying to, for the people.  It's got to be an inch long.  I'm thinking, you ever get incense?  Look how big.  You know, a little thing of it?  Oh, yeah, how thick it is?  Like it's thick on the bottom, and then it was thin as like a cone almost.  That's sort of what it looked like.  Look how big it is at the bottom.  It is fucking big.  The green pus.  I can't take it.  Can you back up?  Because I don't.  Bobby distracted us so bad.  Okay, we're backing up, Dr. Steve.  Oh, God.  Bobby, you can do this, Bobby.  You can do this.  Hold on, Bobby.  Bobby, you can do this. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, shit.  Bobby, you can do this.  You can do this.  Just if you feel resistance, don't keep pulling.  Oh, shit, here it comes.  Oh, God, that hurts.  Ow.  He's out?  Is it bleeding?  Just some like yellow stuff came out.  Oh, do you see it in the frame?  Yeah.  Oh.  It's giant and the green oozy stuff dripping out of that hole. 
[02:45:30]  That's all fucking food and shit that it was eating.  It's its own shit.  It's own shit.  And pus.  Food and cum.  Oh, it was like.  I have her head right there.  It was like when, you know, when you fuck a chick in the ass and you cum and then you pull it out and just that her asshole regurgitates the little load.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Her asshole won't accept the jizz so it just re-pukes out.  Oh.  That is so fucking disgusting. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, that bitch had that in her head.  Oh, fuck Belize.  I can't.  I can't.  Who's going to Belize after that?  I'm not going to Belize.  Oh, fuck Belize.  Fuck that.  I hear they have nice beaches.  Fuck that.  We should send somebody down there and just fucking make them get that like a bunch of them.  Oh, God.  That is so disgusting.  Oh, God.  That's fucking nasty.  Unbelievable.  That's fucking terrible.  I got goosebumps.  I wouldn't be able to do that.  I wouldn't be able to help my chick out.  No. 
[02:46:30]  I wouldn't be able to fucking do that.  I'd fucking.  I'd remove it with a 38.  But look at the rings around it.  Yeah.  Like the head is huge, full of food.  It's all engorged.  It's got, it's about, it's about 10 times bigger than the hole it came out of.  My God.  That's fucking amazing.  And then the green pussy stuff running out of our head.  Well, Dr. Steve, back to you.  Oh, Dr. Steve. 
[02:47:00]  You're wonderful.  It's terrible.  Fucking parasites.  But you have to smoke it out like a crack addict.  Yeah.  I got a parasite for Danny to Google image.  It's called Ascaris.  A-S-C-A-R-I-S.  And just go to Google and then.  Oh, God.  No, it looks like Chinese noodles.  Danny, go back to that other thing, too.  Because I got a.  Wow.  Why is it coming out of everything?  What is that?  Why is it coming out of his mouth?  It's a round worm.  And it'll, they'll, they'll infect your GI tract. 
[02:47:30]  And they'll come out of your mouth.  And if you look at that second picture, you can see a big mass wad of them coming out of  somebody's ass.  That's what happened.  This guy had.  That's what the guy had.  Get the fuck out of here.  He's shitting spaghetti.  Bobby.  Bobby.  He's just shitting spaghetti.  He'll be okay.  He'll be okay, Bobby.  He's just shitting spaghetti.  Oh, did you see all the fucking shit coming out? 
[02:48:00]  Imagine that coming out of your ass.  You feel it crawling on your fucking rectum.  Yep.  Those are ass maggots.  Bobby's making me shwant.  Ass maggots.  Why would you know that that's their doctor fucking whatever, Steve?  Why don't you feel that?  Why don't you feel that coming out of you?  How do you live like that?  Oh, you do.  I'm sure he felt it when he came out.  That's why he spread his legs and let somebody take a picture of me.  Because it was a stunning event. 
[02:48:30]  Because the guy.  You would definitely know.  That's what the guy on the show had last night, but only one came out.  This.  All that came out at once?  It's a pile of these worms all over his balls.  And they're alive, too, right?  Yes.  So when they come out.  I can't.  They're moving, right?  Like, could you keep them as pets and feed them, like, lettuce or avocado? 
[02:49:00]  Could you keep them?  Could they live outside of your body?  Oh, fuck.  Huh?  Oh, there's blood on them.  I'm sorry.  Probably keep them in, you know, like, outhouse water or something.  You could keep them in, like, if you kept them, if you shit into a bucket and threw them in there?  Like a bucket of shit.  That's the only thing I could think of.  A bucket of shit.  You could keep those as pets?  I think you could.  If you wanted to. 
[02:49:30]  That's a horror movie right there.  Just a fucking guy who shit out, like, 90 worms.  I can't fucking deal with this.  Wow.  Oh, thank you.  That may have been a picture after the person had been treated with medication to kill them, and then you just shit them all out at once.  Now, that may be what that is.  I just tweeted the spaghetti picture for everybody.  Good boy.  Hey, can I get the other one for everyone, too, Danny?  The fucking maggot thing.  Freeze frame on the video.  Head maggot?  Yeah, yeah.  Freeze frame.  They're asking for that, too. 
[02:50:00]  God, and you can get that.  You can get that for no reason.  Nothing.  Right?  Yep.  Just nothing.  Just sitting by your pool.  Well, eating contaminated food and stuff.  And that's the thing that scares me is that, like, tapeworms, okay?  Oh, that was...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You get this thing called psychosis, and it causes disease in one person.  But then, if you have a tapeworm, and you shit out the tapeworm eggs onto, say, a lettuce field, 
[02:50:30]  because you happen to be out harvesting lettuce for a dollar an hour...  I don't like that you're saying that, like, that happens all the time.  And then it gets into the food supply.  If you eat those eggs, then you will get the parasite, and you'll get a big old tapeworm.  So, you know, I'm definitely an advocate of washing your food wherever...  No shit, right?  Wash everything constantly.  Keep washing.  I'm OCD now.  I'm officially washing guy OCD. 
[02:51:00]  Get him some fucking...  Get him some soap, what?  I need...  Oh, really?  Okay.  Sorry.  Something just popped in another Mel Gibson voicemail.  Yeah, you need some soap right now.  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  No way!  No way, Danny.  What?  That's...  No, you're fucking...  You're out of your mind, brother.  That's not...  What is that?  Oh, they're attached to something.  They're pulling it out of his colon, his intestines.  Oh, my God!  Ah! 
[02:51:30]  What is that?  What is that?  They laid a guy open.  They're, like, pulling his intestines out and squeezing these worms out of it.  No, they're not!  Here they are.  They're like space food.  They're using his intestines like space food.  Hand sanitizer.  No, I don't want to touch anything right now.  I'm just afraid.  I'm afraid.  I don't want this.  I don't want to ever get that.  I just want to go live in a bubble like John Travolta. 
[02:52:00]  Dr. Steve, if I stay in my house and then just, like, never come out, will I ever get that?  Well, you know, this is the one plus side to the overly processed diet that we have is it's unlikely you'll get a parasite from it.  Oh, that's good news.  Yeah.  So, what is the most common thing in America that we get?  Pinworms.  What is that?  Pinworms.  Pinworms.  Pinworms are the most common of that kind of parasite that we're talking about. 
[02:52:30]  You know, it's sort of nasty thing.  They come out at night.  They're little tiny worms, and kids get them.  They pass them back and forth in school.  And you have to take a piece of tape and stick it on the kid's anus and then put it under the microscope and look and see if he gets it.  And what's wrong with that?  What if you do that anyways?  And what, are you going to yank it off real fast and giggle?  See his asshole fucking mark on the tape, like a fingerprint, like he just solved a kiddie crime? 
[02:53:00]  Oh, God, Danny.  They come out at night.  They're little worms, and they just cause itchy butt.  The kid's just itch.  But I believe that's the most common of the...  What about ringworm?  Now, ringworm's actually a fungus, not a worm.  Oh, that's easy.  Oh, it is.  It's just a ring around your skin.  We can handle that one, right?  Danny Freeze framed that one video so perfect, the removal of the maggot.  I just tweeted that fucking shot. 
[02:53:30]  The pus.  We'll be ready on Twitter.  Yeah, the pus, like, kind of dripping out of the hole after he pulled the maggot.  It's fucking green.  That's its food.  That's its shit of food, right?  And it's also pus that has turned green.  What is that?  Why is it turning green, Dr. Steve?  Some of that's the body's reaction to this foreign body.  Oh, it's like an infection, probably?  A little infection action?  Yeah, so you get a lot of white blood cells in there to try to fight this stupid...  ...fly larva off, and they just can't do it.  So you get pus, and you get fly larva, and, you know, inflammation. 
[02:54:00]  What makes pus turn green?  There's...  It depends.  Now, there are certain bacteria that can turn pus green.  You know, there's a thing called...  Pus.  Pus is the worst.  Oh, shit.  I can't think of a name of it right now.  Pus is the worst.  Pus is a horrible word.  It's a terrible name.  Pus is the worst fluid that could come out of your body.  Even the word is perfect for that shit, pus.  But you add a Y to it, and it's a lovely word. 
[02:54:30]  That's true.  Pussy.  Yes, Dr. Steve?  Persons will say, this wound is pussy, or, you know, this guy had a pussy, you know, wound on his side.  And the transcriptionists have a hell of a time trying to figure out how to spell that.  Oh, pussy.  Yeah.  Oh, you wacky doctors.  I know.  Oh, Dr. Steve.  My God.  It's just always frightening. 
[02:55:00]  So pinworms make your asshole itchy?  Can adults get those?  Yeah, real itchy.  Just real itchy.  So your asshole itches all the time?  It could be pinworms?  Yeah.  Yes.  But it's mostly at night.  And the weird thing is, is how in the hell do these things that are living in your asshole know it's night?  Isn't it always night in there?  But they only come out of it.  On some people.  How do they know?  It's Dr. Steve Seinfeld.  How do they know it's nighttime?  Unless you're walking around with your asshole open. 
[02:55:30]  How do the pinworms know that it's nighttime?  What if I'm reading next to a lamp at night?  Fuck.  Hey, Steve.  Yeah.  So you put tape on your asshole?  Do I?  No, not you.  Like if you wanted to kill pinworms.  Have you?  Oh, okay.  No, that's how they test for it.  You do that to diagnose it, not to kill them.  How do you kill the pinworm? 
[02:56:00]  You take one dose of a medication and it kills them all.  That's easy.  Cum.  I've delivered at least eight inches into the rectum.  Have you ever removed a maggot, Dr. Steve?  I have seen wounds that are infested with maggots.  I had a homeless guy that, you know, and everybody's seen this.  Where you get the guy that hasn't been taking care of himself, has a wound on his leg.  They, uh, did you hang up on me?  No.  No, we're in here. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  We get to hear the other side of that now, Ant.  He has reason to be paranoid.  So that's what it sounds like.  Yeah, how many times have you said that to yourself then?  No one heard.  Hang up on me.  Oh, fuck.  That's classic.  You open up the, you open up the gauze and there's just this wound infested with maggots.  Yeah, but don't they use maggots, uh, in some hospitals now, uh, to actually clean the wound?  Because they eat all the-  1800s.  No, they do it now.  They have been used up until recently, uh, to clean really dirty wounds. 
[02:57:00]  And I think there's still some places where they still use them.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Because it eats all the, uh, dead skin, right?  Yeah, it makes a beautiful wound.  I mean, these guys that come in with the maggot infested wounds, it's usually very clean.  You know, because the maggots, they have hearty appetite.  Thank God for the maggot.  Oh.  And the faggot.  How about you just clean your fucking wound out?  Oh, God.  Oh.  Or that. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, or your ass.  Damn.  Could you, uh, fuck, why am I going with the listener suggestion?  Haven't we learned?  Yeah, I know, right?  Let me write this down just in case for Danny.  God damn it.  Oh, God, I can't take it.  I'm freaked out.  Maybe you did this one.  I don't know.  So we have no-  We don't have to worry about bullshit, right?  Yeah, for the most part-  It's probably the same thing, but different video.  All right.  So if you go out of the country, that's when you-  That's when you get fucked up.  So you should just stay in the country. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah.  Don't leave.  What about Canada?  Everything.  Just don't drink water and don't eat vegetables.  That are raw, that haven't been washed thoroughly, and even then I would still not eat raw vegetables in certain countries.  Can you get anything from, like, licking a girl's asshole?  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, if she's got something that could be transmitted fecal orally, sure.  Oh, wow.  I can't look at it.  Oh, God.  What is that?  Did you see that?  No, I didn't see anything. 
[02:58:30]  This is more botfly stuff.  Bobby, look at this.  Oh, botflies.  It's terrible.  It's the worst.  They come out to breathe.  Yeah.  You remove them with tweezers.  That's so fucking crazy.  What follows is the removal of three human botfly larvae.  Human?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  The first of three.  There's...  All right, they're taking the tape off, I guess.  Oh, you have to suffocate it.  Yeah, because you've got to...  That's crazy. 
[02:59:00]  There's one.  There's one.  There's one.  I don't...  I can't.  I can't.  Oh, that's a little one.  I can't.  I can't.  I can't watch this.  No, this is worse than the ring.  Oh, frick.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, God damn it.  Oh, did you see that hole?  That one's fucking full.  I can't watch this.  I'm tapping.  Tapping out.  You can watch this.  Nope, I can't.  I'm not even watching anymore.  Here comes number two. 
[02:59:30]  I'm not watching.  That's huge.  Heads down.  That's fucking huge.  Brim of Hat hiding television.  If I'm watching it, you should watch it.  I'm just going to look at Martha's tits here.  Oh, my God.  Oh, look at that.  Look at the hole it leaves.  Jesus.  That's a big hole.  Oh!  Another one's coming out.  Hey, Dr. Steve, we've got a guy on the line.  Greg from D.C.  Can't get to him right now, but let me pass this question on to you, sir.  Yeah, man.  Is there a parasite that crawls up your dick hole?  Yes.  In the Amazon.  Please.  In the Amazon. 
[03:00:00]  In the Amazon.  In the water.  Make him say no.  There's a fish that crawls up your dick hole.  Yeah.  A fish?  We talked about that before.  What it does is if you're in the, and I think it is the Amazon.  It is.  If you urinate while you're in the water, this thing follows the chemical trail back up into  your penis.  And the thing about it is, is you know how fish are, if you stroke them one way, they're  smooth.  And if you stroke them the other way, their fins stick up.  Right.  So if you, if you, if you, if the thing goes in, it can go in, but it can't come back out. 
[03:00:30]  Can't come out.  Oh my God.  And it has to be surgically removed.  Your dick turns into like a roach motel.  Yeah.  What does it do to your dick before you get it removed?  Well, it's, well, first off, it's a fish and it's lodged in your dick and then it dies.  So it starts to rot immediately.  And the barbs from its fins, you know, that are now pointing the wrong way, start to cut  into the urethra, you know, the tube going through your, your cock hole, your cock. 
[03:01:00]  So it's a, it's, it's just a lovely situation.  I bet you it doesn't, I bet you it doesn't hurt to pee at all.  I'm sure there's no burning feeling when you're peeing, having a dead fish in your fucking  pee hole, ripping into your urethra.  My dick smells like that anyways.  Dead fish.  I actually, I actually, I actually said the joke and then I explained it.  Yeah.  Dead fish.  I went, I went, I'm a fucking, ugh. 
[03:01:30]  We have any more questions for Dr. Steve today?  No.  Hey, Dr. Steve, have you fucked up because of the show while you're with a regular, uh,  patient and just said cock hole?  So what happens is it goes in your cock hole, shit, fuck.  No, I, for some reason there is that sort of wall that goes up and I'm, it's just, uh,  yeah, I've never had that problem.  It's called being a professional.  Yes.  Your, your, your radio show name is perfect.  Weird medicine. 
[03:02:00]  And we got one of these questions coming in.  Is it true?  Jeremy in Canada, some countries tie strings to gerbils' tails and put them in your ass  to eat the parasites.  Stop it.  Yeah.  That's ridiculous.  Now you're being silly.  That's, uh, the, uh, from Dr. Richard Gere.  He prescribes that one.  He'll never live that down, even though it never happened.  All right.  I guess we're pictures of the penis fish on Google.  Is it called? 
[03:02:30]  Condiru.  C-A-N-D-I-R-U.  Condiru.  We can't remember that word, so.  I can't look.  I can't look anymore.  I'm, I'm getting all freaked out.  There's fucking great white sharks off of Cape Cod now.  That's great.  So?  Fuck.  What?  So?  Water's too cold to swim anyway.  In Cape Cod?  Cape Cod.  The water sucks.  It's fucking ice cold half the time.  I grew up there, so I can jump in, though it doesn't bother me.  But I'm not fucking swimming there anymore.  Good for you.  You're not going to get bit by a shark.  Don't worry about it.  Really? 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, really.  Really?  Yes.  How many people get bitten by sharks?  Is that it?  What the fuck is that?  That's not it.  That's fucking.  I'm only got.  That looks.  That's great.  A Google penis fish.  I am not going.  I am not leaving anywhere.  I am going home.  I'm going to my pool.  I'm putting.  I'm putting so much chlorine in my pool.  I'm going to come out looking like Johnny Winter.  I'm not fucking touching anything.  Let's ruin Anthony's pool for him. 
[03:03:30]  What's in his pool right now, Dr. Steve?  What could possibly be in his pool right now?  It's crystalline clean, and every week the guy comes and checks the chemicals, and it's  got a great soap.  Really?  The worst thing is like water mold.  Really?  I've never heard of any.  Yeah, but can't those little mosquitoes die on the top, the microscopic mosquitoes,  and then when you go in, they go in your mouth?  What do I got a pond?  What the fuck do you think I got?  Are you stagnant water?  I got a waterfall, motherfucker.  It's a five-gallon pail of fucking stagnant water.  What is it, inside of a tire?  It's actually rain water.  Inside of a tire.  Inside of a tire.  That's beautiful. 
[03:04:00]  Dr. Steve, we got to go.  Okay.  Yes.  Dr. Steve, thank you so much.  I think the big show is coming up very soon.  Yes.  This Saturday night.  Yep.  Weird Medicine with Dr. Steve.  All right, boys.  All right, man.  Wow.  Thank you, Bobby, for bringing that to the show.  God, was that just an awful...  Monsters Inside or something like that?  It's the worst.  On Animal Planet?  A show I definitely will not be checking out.  It feels a little funny now.  I freak out at everything.  I feel like I got worms in me now.  You probably do, dude.  You probably ate something.  No, I don't.  I just had some turkey. 
[03:04:30]  They have turkey.  Yeah, they have stuff in turkey.  They have turkey worms.  They have turkey worms.  What's in turkey?  You have some bad turkey.  The turkey worm.  What's in turkey, man?  Oh, you shit out giblets.  Giblets.  I don't want to shit giblets.  Your ball sack looks like a turkey neck?  Yeah, I feel something slap on my thighs.  I reach back and it's the turkey neck.  And then when you blow a load, it goes, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Yeah, it's that red thing that hangs below their fucking bill that looks like balls just hanging out of my asshole. 
[03:05:00]  What is that called?  It's called the red thing that hangs under there.  The root?  What is it?  The beak.  Listen, Bob Kelly's going to be at the Helium Comedy Club in Philly tonight.  Two shows tomorrow, two shows Saturday.  HeliumComedy.com.  Bobby hasn't been down there in a while, so go see Bobby.  Support Bob Kelly, please.  Please do that.  Yes.  For us and for Bob Kelly.  And when we get back, Anthony, another voicemail from Mel Gibson.  Thank God.  But this whole story might have a happy ending because he tries to make good in his final voicemail.  Oh, wow. 
[03:05:30]  That's nice.  That's sweet of him.  And we'll play that next.  But first, Rich Voss talking to Mel Gibson.  You got to hear this.  Look, shoot me later, but hear this now.  You're listening to the Opium Anthony Show on the Virus Sirius XM.  Hey, man.  Thanks for checking us out today.  We got another Mel Gibson audio clip.  Yeah, what does it say?  Voicemail or is it him talking to her?  I don't know.  We're going to listen to a cult. 
[03:06:00]  Oh, nice.  I guess we got to give a plug to Radar Online.  Yeah.  For bringing all this goodness to the world.  Yeah, they're the ones that have...  They got a gold mine with this stuff.  ...flying these.  They knew it, too.  I'm sure they got all this material at once and then decided, let's just give them a little  piece every day.  Yeah, yeah.  This is the final voicemail, though.  This could be the end.  This could be it, Anthony.  Oh, no.  You think this is it or is there more audio?  I hope there's more.  Oh, Bobo's on the line. 
[03:06:30]  Oh.  Hey, Bobo, you want to talk about Mr. Maloonigans?  Yeah, that's right.  People were wondering what was with that name.  It was a name my sister thought of because she said the dog looked like an Irish man and  the dog kind of had an Irish-sounding name, kind of.  Okay, thanks.  Mel Gibson, Anthony.  Yes.  Voicemail, the final voicemail where he tries to make good.  Trust him to make good after all that.  After all that, he left this voicemail that we're about to hear. 
[03:07:00]  Hi, I'm just calling to check on your status, the status of puppy, the baby, and I want to  talk reasonably about schedules and how I haven't got a voice left.  How do we go further?  Just reasonably. 
[03:07:30]  There's no passion left anyway, so I don't need to get mad.  I figured that out.  It doesn't matter enough.  I just, you know, want to do the right thing now so everybody's comfortable.  All right?  Okay, bye.  Wait, after all we've listened to.  Who the fuck does he sound like?  It's driving me nuts.  A lunatic. 
[03:08:00]  A lunatic, of course.  After all we've been listening to.  He goes, I don't have any voice.  Of course he doesn't have any voice left.  He's been screaming cunt at her the entire time.  It actually sounds like our old boss in Boston, trying to negotiate with us.  B-b-b-boys.  Hi.  Oh, boys.  Give me a call.  We'll talk about schedules.  Oh, boys.  Just want to make things right.  So now he just wants to make things right, because the passion's gone.  Hi. 
[03:08:30]  Hi.  Just fuck it.  Just fuck it.  He does sound beaten.  Yeah, he sounds like kind of a beaten man there.  I don't think he sounds beaten.  I think he just sounds exhausted.  Exhausted from just screaming.  He's dehydrated from yelling so much.  You listen to the first recording, and he was just screaming cunt.  And then now?  Now he's just high.  He needs electrolytes.  Hi.  Hi. 
[03:09:00]  Well.  Just want to make things good.  Because I've lost a passion.  Passion.  Passion.  Poor Mel.  Eh.  He'll do.  He'll be fine.  Some people are saying this is the first tape.  Yeah.  It started with this.  Oh, it started with that, and then just escalated.  Yeah.  But they released them backwards.  Backwards.  What do you think of the Mel Gibson thing, Bobby?  I just...  I've been there, man.  You can't...  Any guy, you can't fucking listen to that and be like, I know exactly what the fuck he's  talking about. 
[03:09:30]  I mean, even if you didn't do it out loud, you've done it in your head.  Yeah.  You know?  I mean, I've...  I think a lot of people have done it out loud, though.  Yeah.  I believe that.  There's some guys that don't...  Like, fucking anger to them is like a fucking punchline, but, you know, some guys, it's  fucking jail.  Like, you know, anger to me, I'm fucking going to jail.  I have to control my anger, because I will wind up in fucking jail.  Really?  You're that bad?  Yeah, you've never envisioned just fucking slicing somebody's throat with a broken CD? 
[03:10:00]  No, Bobby.  I haven't.  No, anyways.  Not me.  I haven't either.  Nice talking to you.  I want...  I'd actually...  I've dreamed about getting a ninja outfit and stalking people, jumping out of a fucking  tree and throwing a star at their forehead.  Jesus.  Someone would have to really do something bad to, like, family and shit like that to get  me to the point of where I'm that angry.  Anyway, I get pissed, but not that Mel Gibson pissed.  Or OJ pissed.  You know, I'm not...  You can tell I'm not a tough guy, because I get that angry. 
[03:10:30]  Real tough guys don't get angry like that.  They just act.  Oh, they just grab you by the neck.  That's true.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Real tough...  You're right.  Yeah, I'm not...  I bark.  Guys who aren't tough just fucking, oh, fucking kid fucking asshole.  Let's go.  Yeah, yeah.  And they just bump chest, but a real tough guy just smiles and then grabs you by the neck  and twists your head off and shits on your cheek and then leaves.  There's no buildup.  There's no buildup.  He just does it.  Yeah, like Joe Rogan, you can tell, is a real tough guy.  He doesn't build it. 
[03:11:00]  No.  He doesn't rip his shirt off and go, let's go.  He just doesn't.  He just doesn't blink when he stares at you.  Like, when he did that Carlos Mencia stuff when he went on stage and Carlos was egging  him on and calling him a bitch, he was just looking at him like, what?  Okay.  Like, smiling.  Like, if that was me, I would have gotten...  You could tell Carlos isn't a tough guy because he was screaming and yelling and getting crazy.  If it was me and Carlos, it would have just been two yelling fucking fatos.  And Rogan knows.  He just looks over and goes, I could just kill you right now.  It doesn't matter.  Oh, it's just the fucking alpha... 
[03:11:30]  The ultimate alpha male.  He doesn't.  He looks and goes, yeah, what?  What?  Yeah, he'd be the leader.  I'd be the guy that's just, like, forged for shit.  Like, berries.  You're the guy that's laying down on your side and he's sitting on you to prove that  he's the alpha male.  When he comes in, I have to become a chair.  Yeah, you gotta, like, lay down on your side and he sits on you and then growls at you  a little and then gets up so you know your place.  Norton's the table.  I'm gonna put a fucking half a wild boar on your fucking head.  Hold this for me. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah, he's, uh, I've been there, dude.  I fucking yelled.  You never fucking...  I remember I go to a fight with my wife.  You ever get into a fucking argument and pull that alpha male shit and then...  Fuck up.  Like, you do...  Like, you...  I punched the...  I slammed the cabinet too hard and the wine rack was on the other side hanging on the  wall with four bottles of wine and glasses that her father gave her.  Oh, now you've done it.  Like, and I slammed it and then in an instant it just fell off and all four bottles of wine 
[03:12:30]  and every glass just went smash.  It was the most amazing dramatic sound I've ever heard.  Yeah, huge glass break and a little liquid.  Tears welled up immediately because she looked at her.  She went, those are my father's glances.  Oh, shit.  Oh, fuck.  Takes you right out of it.  I was right too.  I had the upper hand.  Did you yell, but you blew it?  Now, clean it up!  You guinea bread!  But you blew it.  Yeah.  Hey, uh, we should get Sam in here.  There's, uh, something going on around here.  Sam hates...  We were just in the elevator together. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah.  He hates Friendly Bob.  Oh, I hate Friendly Bob too in the elevator.  What's wrong with Friendly Bob?  I don't know why.  It's so embarrassing.  I like Friendly Bob.  It's embarrassing to be around Friendly Bob.  We go on an elevator and Bobby gets to know the people in the elevator with him.  What's wrong with that?  He's so, hi, I'm Bob, what's your name?  And the girl's like, you know, Christine, she'll say something.  And they're like, hi, Christine, what do you do?  What do you do?  Oh, I work on, you know, one of the floors here. 
[03:13:30]  We're a financial operation.  Oh, great, did you go to school for that?  And I'm just looking and going, and they really don't want to be bothered.  But they feel compelled that they've got to talk because he's being so friendly.  Friendly Bob.  But I don't understand the fucking craziness is that that's like friendly, nice behavior,  but that makes everybody uncomfortable.  It's uncomfortable in an elevator.  It's like you're trying to pick them up. 
[03:14:00]  But no one's friendly on a fucking vertical trip that is measured in feet.  You can't really get a relationship going.  I just fucking hung out with Ed.  Ed's a nice guy.  You guys were in the elevator together.  The problem is there's no punchline either to the bit.  That's what's really weird about it.  It's very uncomfortable.  It's just a friendly conversation.  It's great, though.  I love it.  Ed was great, right?  We talked elevators, how Fox has better elevators because it tells you what elevator to go to. 
[03:14:30]  But Ed was into it.  Like, Ed was like, yeah, I'm having a conversation about elevators right now with a guy on an elevator.  And this is like an entertaining part of the day for me.  Oh, my God.  Poor Ed.  Ed is just going to work.  He's just, you know, he works in an office.  He's got a tie on or whatever.  And that's probably.  He had a big bag of loneliness that he just got from some deli.  That's the most entertaining.  Big of loneliness.  The most entertaining conversation he'll have all day.  Just two fucking sandwiches and a donut.  Talking to Bob about the elevators. 
[03:15:00]  Now, at Fox, they show you what elevator you're supposed to go to.  And then he went, yeah, at least that way you know where the hell you're going, huh?  I know.  Friendly Bob was all about it.  Yeah.  Got to film that shit.  What do you got in your hands, Sam?  This is just extra evidence in case we need it.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Sam's been doing some P.I. shit around here, Ant.  Yeah, I know.  He's got.  How do we set this up?  What do you got?  You've been doing some investigative journalism.  That's right.  I'm glad you referred to it that way instead of what you said before. 
[03:15:30]  Oh, what?  Being a nosy prick?  Yeah, keeping my shit in everybody else's shit.  In everyone else's shit.  Oh, you heard that?  Oops.  You know what it is?  He's like a cub reporter.  He heard something.  He heard something.  Some rumbling.  Some rumor.  Innuendo.  And went out and got the truth.  He's like the show Faggot Inside.  He just goes and crawls in you and finds out all kinds of shit.  Oh, he really is.  Yeah.  I don't like that fucking shirt either. 
[03:16:00]  You'll be wearing it in about two months.  Is he behind in fashion?  That's right.  Is what you're saying?  Yeah.  He shouted out on Twitter that Levi's were in style about six months after that came out.  Levi's are back in style.  I told you that.  I know that.  But that was a while ago before you tweeted it.  I'm talking about straight men.  So am I.  You're not straight.  Neither are you.  Well, not when it comes to you.  Of course, neither are you.  Not when it comes to you.  All right.  You're wearing a fucking twink picnic table shirt.  You like it? 
[03:16:30]  Of course I do.  Look at it.  Little thin hips.  Just uncomfortable.  I love the way you lean on one of your little thin ass cheeks.  That is a little fucking going out on a picnic.  Yeah, it's fun.  Look at the way he rolls his sleeves up.  Like a little fucking.  Did your mommy do that for you?  No, I don't live with my mommy.  I put her on this morning by myself.  She does your laundry, though.  She does.  Yeah, she washed it.  Your mom does her laundry?  Yes, she's trying to sound mature.  Like, no, I do this.  Oh, but your mommy washed it.  She washed it.  Why does your mother do your laundry?  Because I go over to my mom's house for dinner, like maybe once a week, and bring the laundry. 
[03:17:00]  And go pick it up.  Why don't you get your eyebrows fucking dental flossed?  Those Indian people.  Why don't you?  Threaded, you mean?  Yeah, threaded.  Why don't you clean those up?  I'm not going to get my eyebrows threaded.  Why not?  It's effeminate.  I want those cleaned up.  I don't want to clean them up.  I want them cleaned up.  They're masculine.  They're very bushy.  I have a strong brow.  You do.  And that's a character building trait.  So does the Neanderthal, man.  Dude, can we shave your eyebrows? 
[03:17:30]  You have the same brow as John Travolta in Battlefield Earth.  We've got to shave his eyebrows.  We have to.  How much would it cost for us to shave your eyebrows?  Look, let's at least discuss it a little bit.  Let's discuss what's happened so far.  Because they're so fucking bushy.  Can you imagine it without eyebrows?  How about this?  Not even just shave them, but really thin.  Like, you know, like a...  Here's the problem with the whole idea.  But have one going up like he's always...  He just solved the crime. 
[03:18:00]  Here's what goes wrong with this.  You're very enthusiastic about it now.  You're very enthusiastic about it now.  Yeah.  Just like you were when you said,  Hey, Sam, why don't you grow your hair?  And you and Danny have a contest.  And then two years later, you realize Danny and me are still growing our hair and everybody's forgotten.  Or when you said, Hey...  But you could have cut in your hair by now.  Hey, Sam, why don't you...  When was the last time you cut your hair at this point?  It was when the contest was first brought up.  I don't remember the contest anymore.  It was probably...  Two years? 
[03:18:30]  Two and a half years?  I think this...  Three years in December?  Yeah, three years in December.  It was right before Christmas break.  Holy shit.  And I think I had gone two months before that.  So it'll be three years.  You haven't cut your hair in two and a half years.  I've seen if you're going bald.  I'm not going bald.  I have...  Is he from pulling it back?  That's what happens.  If he goes bald, he's going to look like Larry from Three Stooges.  Oh, God.  No, I'm very sensitive about that.  I'm loving you.  I check the hairline in different pictures to make sure it's...  Make sure everything's okay.  It has remained constant.  It has remained constant.  If you're bald with those bushy eyebrows, that's going to be a hell of a look.  Well, I mean, then...  He's going to have to use your eyebrows as a donor. 
[03:19:00]  Fucking...  Yeah, I'll just do a comb over right over his forehead.  It'd be fucking awesome.  But Sam is here for another reason.  Exactly.  You did some investigating, so set this up here.  Well, you know we have an intern that we've met.  We've met some of the interns, and one was...  Wait, this guy's going to be able to prepare.  Is he listening right now?  Probably not.  He's a terrible intern.  Is he really?  He's awful.  He didn't show up today until 8.30. 
[03:19:30]  Okay.  Ugh.  But, yeah, he...  Well, let's just play...  You know what?  Play the first clip, I think.  Oh, okay.  Go right to a clip.  I think you'll recognize.  I'm intrigued.  Steve, Queens, you're on a fez.  Hey, what's up, fez?  Congratulations on your win.  Yeah, see, you said about the fez haters.  The fez haters on around because they all fucking dropped out of AIDS already.  Good one.  Perfect.  Get it, fez?  I don't know if that was sticking up for me or not. 
[03:20:00]  Well, Ronnie didn't know what to do with that call, and I don't blame him.  It was a terrible call.  We've had a few of those calls ourselves.  It was a horrible call, is what you're getting at.  I just don't understand what that has to do with anything.  All right?  Ron and Fez show.  Yeah.  It's a great show.  And a guy named Steve from Queens calls in, so...  Well, the problem is Steve from Queens has a very similar voice to Brian in Brooklyn.  Brian from...  Yeah, well, I mean, why don't we play Brian from Brooklyn's call?  Uh, let's go over here to Brian in Brooklyn. 
[03:20:30]  You're on Ron and Fez.  Hey, Fez, listen, man.  I heard that guy, that asshole that told you to resign and all that shit.  Listen, man, you gotta keep your head up, because you know what?  When I was really depressed and I wanted to do horrible things with myself, listening to you really cheered me up, man.  So I don't want to see you upset or anything.  That really bothers me.  When did we turn into a children's show?  What is happening, Hicks?  It's like it's fucking Ron and Happy the Clown doing a show here.  Nah, Fez is the best, though, man.  How old are you, Brian? 
[03:21:00]  Me?  I'm 19.  I mean, your balls haven't dropped yet.  Very good.  So Brian and Steve sound very similar to each other.  Brian and Steve.  Brian...  Were the callers.  Yeah.  Yeah, just, uh, that was Brian in Brooklyn, and of course...  Uh, Steve, Queens, you're on Ron and Fez.  Hey, what's up, Fez?  Congratulations on your win.  Yeah.  It's the same guy.  The same guy.  With two different names.  Yeah.  Same guy.  Steve from Queens and Brian in Brooklyn are the same guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So?  The crazy thing is...  Yeah.  ...that we also have caller ID. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  And they have the same phone number as well.  Wow!  You are looking into things.  And the even crazier thing is, if you listen closely to their voice, it sounds like somebody  that we've had on this show before.  Really?  That's right.  Now, who the fuck could that be?  Well, I mean, we talk about interns.  It's not Intern David.  No.  You know, it doesn't sound anything like him.  He's got a very distinct voice.  Of course.  It's not Love Buzz.  Love Buzz can barely string together a sentence.  I know.  He's retarded. 
[03:22:00]  Exactly.  Exactly.  But who it does sound like is somebody who went through a lie detector test not too long  ago.  Yes.  Yes.  Who insisted he doesn't lie, even though it seemed like he lied.  Right.  That would be Derek the Intern.  Derek the Intern.  Derek the Intern.  Yes.  The racist lying intern, Derek.  Well, where is he?  Is now calling Ron and Fez's different people.  Now, what the fuck is he doing that for?  I don't know.  Especially ruining Ron and Fez's great show and treating them like fools by lying to them 
[03:22:30]  and humiliating them.  And also making Fez feel like he's got some support out there.  Well, I mean, that's, I don't know if that's the negative part.  I was bringing up the, but I mean, you know, Fez is probably holding on to what Steve from  Queens and Brian and Brooklyn are saying, it's the same guy, which means it's less people  that are supporting Fez.  And then it turns out he probably doesn't even support Fez.  He's just, you know.  He's just trying to call him.  He knows that's a way to get on the Ron and Fez show. 
[03:23:00]  Now, uh.  Ah.  How you doing?  Hi.  Why don't you step up to the mic?  Stand right next to the mic.  Step up to the mic.  Just make believe it's a phone.  Go ahead.  And, uh, just say, uh.  Say Ron and Fez or something.  Hi, I'm, just pick a random name and place.  Where, where do you think?  But Night Stalker.  Maybe Brian in Brooklyn?  Say, like, hi, this is Brian from Brooklyn.  Hi, this is, uh, Brian from Brooklyn.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Uh, let's go over here to Brian in Brooklyn. 
[03:23:30]  You're on, man, Fez.  Hey, Fez, listen, man.  Try that one.  Say, hey, Fez, listen, man.  Get a little enthusiasm.  Hey, Fez, what's going on, man?  Oh, it's not how you say it.  It's not the quote.  Hey, Fez, listen, man.  Say that.  Say, hey, Fez, listen, man.  Hey, Fez, listen, man.  Listen, man.  You work at a helium factory?  Yeah, yeah.  Look, look.  So is your real name Derek, first of all?  I don't even know at this point.  Yeah, my name's Derek.  Okay, so your name is Derek. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, he goes, he goes, yeah, like we're supposed to be.  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Sorry that we don't believe you.  You've never, you've never told a lie, right?  Right?  No.  Yeah.  No, yeah.  No, yeah.  Well, whichever one is a lie, pick that one.  No, yeah.  But he's kind of, you know, telling the truth in there somewhere.  Yeah.  Now, what the fuck is this?  The fuck is what?  What's with the calls to Rana Fez?  Was that you or no? 
[03:24:30]  No, it was me.  I'm not going to lie and say I wasn't.  Oh, you lie about the name.  Yeah, because I don't, I called up once and I actually used my real name and somebody  said, oh, Spy Report, oh, that was the intern and I just.  Now, the weird thing is that yesterday, Joe, the intern, asked him, when was the last time  you called Rana Fez?  Uh-huh.  And he said, the beginning of my internship.  All right.  The calls we just heard were from last week.  So, a lie.  Oh, no, no, no, no, it wasn't a lie.  I just really forgot that I called. 
[03:25:00]  It was just like on the phone.  You called twice in one day.  You forgot you called Rana Fez?  Is it twice in the day?  That is both, two calls from one show.  Both those calls are from one Rana Fez show?  And that, yes, and that show spanned four hours, one day.  Four hours.  Yes.  So, you changed your name hoping that you wouldn't notice so you could get back on the Rana Fez  show?  No, no, yeah.  No, no, yeah.  No, no, yeah.  He's a fan of the no, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, no.  Answer.  No, no, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, no, no, no.  And did you tell the other intern that you hadn't called Rana Fez since the beginning of your  internship?  It's none of their business when I called. 
[03:25:30]  Did you tell, but no.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I did.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, no.  I'm going to make that into a t-shirt.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, no.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, no.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no.  So, you lied to them?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  You lied to the intern.  And you lied to Rana Fez?  Yeah.  And you don't really support Fez, it was just the way to get on the show?  No, no, I really do.  I think that he really is a good broadcaster.  I like Fez.  That's...  Here's the other problem.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He has called in Rana Fez multiple times and not gotten on the air.  Right.  I talked to Ron and Fez's producer extraordinaire, Chris Stanley, who, again, since there's caller ID, they know when you're calling in. 
[03:26:00]  So did you forget that you called in, or have you called more than those two times?  I've called more than those two times, probably.  Hey, we're getting more info, too, by the way.  We got the great CokeLogic.  His latest animation is on his YouTube channel.  I love CokeLogic.  Passion of the Popeye or Popeye of the Passion or whatever.  Passion of the Popeye, I guess.  YouTube.com slash CokeLogic.  What do you got, CokeLogic? 
[03:26:30]  Thanks, Coke.  Well, last time Ant did a live from the compound, you might go back and listen, and Derek was a caller.  Did he use his real name?  I don't think he asked for a name, but he's definitely a serial callist.  Oh, did you ever call the live from the compound?  Yeah.  No, no, no, no, yeah.  Did you tell me it was you?  Yeah, I said it was me.  Did I know it was you, the intern, you?  I don't think so.  Uh-huh.  You like call radio shows.  And podcasts. 
[03:27:00]  And it does get a little more creepy than just consistently calling Ron and Fez with different names.  We all, you know New Girl, their female intern.  Well, of course.  Yeah.  We've all noticed her.  A lot of fans of New Girl.  Yeah.  Sure, sure.  Everybody likes her.  Derek is actually apparently a fan of New Girl as well.  Oh, really?  Because last time they had her on the air, his call didn't get on air, but he did call up and the intent was for him to go on the air and under an alias, not telling them that he was an O&A intern. 
[03:27:30]  And do you remember what your suggestion was?  I didn't suggest for me.  I suggested they said Love Buzz.  No, your suggestion was you should make a new girl date one of the O&A interns.  Oh, now that, wow.  What name did he use that day?  I don't know.  What name did you use?  Do you remember?  I don't remember.  It was a fake name though, right Derek?  No, it wasn't my real name.  Now, all the lies just...  Why, if you weren't trying to deceive, would you use a fake name and place? 
[03:28:00]  Yeah, dude, that's for you.  Isn't deception...  I don't take that.  Seriously, that's for me, dude.  Just remember I gave it to you.  Because when this fucking serial killer takes all you psychos out, just remember, I gave you five for a cup of coffee.  I'm your friend.  You think just five dollars is going to save you from a fucking...  Yeah.  What's just five dollars?  He'll remember that.  What's he going to do?  Dude, I don't know what he's going to do, but he fucking hasn't blinked and he keeps closing his eyes. 
[03:28:30]  This kid is a fucking...  Is he a problem?  This kid...  Is he a problem?  This kid will hide in a bush.  He's looking at you, Sam, too.  I know.  This kid's looking at you and he's thinking of shit.  Did you see him just close his eyes and fantasize about fucking your dead skull?  I didn't realize that's what the fantasy was.  Look at him.  Look at him.  He's laughing.  Look at him.  He's loving it.  That's a cute laugh, though, Bobby.  Bobby can sniff this shit out, so he is a problem. 
[03:29:00]  He is fucking nuts.  Put that five in your pocket, kid.  Me and you are friends.  Get yourself a Snickers bar and a cup of coffee.  How about you give him 20?  No, I'm not giving him 20.  I'll fucking die.  You don't think much of your life.  I'll fucking beat me to it.  Continue, Sam.  Yeah, so he's trying to get Ron and Fez to convince New Girl to date one of the O&A interns.  Do you remember Harry T, Anthony?  You were a fan of Harry T.  Oh, Harry T was great.  I don't know who Harry T is.  Harry T was in my intern class, as a matter of fact, way back when. 
[03:29:30]  He interned for us?  Yes.  His classes were doing nothing?  No, some of us do things.  But he ended up as a Ron and Fez producer.  But while he was interning, he's the one who feedbacked into the show under an alias  that you guys should play a bit that he had made.  Oh, right.  I remember that.  I think that Derek is going dangerously close to Harry T territory.  What does Love Buzz think?  Is Love Buzz here today?  Yeah.  Where's Love Buzz? 
[03:30:00]  How many times have you called Ron and Fez?  Honestly.  Wow.  I really don't know.  That means it's a lot.  It's a lot.  Probably.  How many times have you been on?  Not a lot.  The few times that I've been on, Ron made fun of my voice and him hang up on me.  Really?  You guys did the same thing to me, though.  Oh.  Does that make you mad?  I know he's called our show.  Oh, guys.  I do know that.  It's just what happens.  It's just weird.  Having an intern go home and then call the show.  It's really strange.  It stays off.  Why aren't you in here, then?  Right.  Just walk in. 
[03:30:30]  Love Buzz.  Hey, what's up?  What do you got on this Derrick kid?  Derrick once threatened my life.  I told you.  I fucking told you.  He's a nutcase.  Wow.  No offense.  Don't get mad.  He's a fucking lunatic.  You've envisioned fucking smashing people's heads like with a rock.  Yeah.  Well, Love Buzz.  You saw True Blood last week and saw them bashing the head in.  Show sucks.  No, I don't watch it.  All right.  I don't either.  Not anymore.  Fruit.  Fruit?  What's the matter with you, Bobby?  I got a wife.  What do you want me to do? 
[03:31:00]  Love Buzz, go ahead.  What do you mean he threatened your life?  I hate it.  I was working on something, and Derek, he comes up to me.  All right, you're a lying now, too.  Yeah, Love Buzz.  Working on something?  What are you talking about?  Yeah, I was working on something.  Okay, what was the something?  I can't believe that.  I was pulling live reads.  There's nothing interesting.  How do you have such fucking huge calves and thin ankles?  I don't know.  All right, go ahead.  I was pulling those live reads, and Derek, what he likes to do is, he likes to stroke 
[03:31:30]  his chin, and he was just staring at me for about ten minutes, and he finally opens his  mouth, and he's like, you know, if I could, I would kill you, and I'll take your spot.  What?  Yeah.  I didn't say that.  You did.  He would kill you.  And take my spot.  And take your spot.  Well, your spot isn't that great.  The stupidest intern we've ever had.  Yeah, I don't know why he wants that.  You do agree.  I don't want to do a spot.  I don't want to do a spot.  You do agree you're stupid, right, Loeb Buzz?  Yeah, it's fine. 
[03:32:00]  And, Derek, you're saying you did not say that.  No, I didn't say that.  No, you did.  No, no, no, I didn't.  Well, as far as trustworthiness goes, we've experienced that Derek has, believe it or  not, lied a few times in the past.  There you go.  There you go.  Look what he looks like.  Ramirez.  Look exactly like him.  Looks like Ramirez.  Look at him.  You do look a lot like Ramirez.  Ramirez.  Make the Ramirez face right now.  Make that.  Turn sideways and make this face right here.  Yeah.  Angry.  Angry. 
[03:32:30]  That's him.  Holy shit.  That's fucking him.  You know.  He's got that facial hair that doesn't connect.  He can't make a full beard or a full goatee.  And you remember when one of our interns was interviewing for an internship here and he put  it on Twitter and you called him out on it and he stopped.  Yes.  Yes.  Since then, I don't know if you're aware, but Derek has been Twittering you.  Really?  Derek was Twittering you and you actually replied, not knowing it was him, about permits for getting 
[03:33:00]  weapons.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's not a psycho.  No.  I'm not right.  I'm not right to give the guy fucking money.  That was our intern, Derek.  Money ain't going to help you, by the way.  You're my friend, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Give him more money, Bobby.  I'm not giving him anything.  You're going to give him the money that actually.  My life is worth five dollars.  Dollars.  Let him afford weapons is what you're going to do.  He's going to get a slingshot.  So you tweet Anthony has fake Twitter names?  No.  It was my, I tweeted with my actual Twitter because somebody asked him about it.  Do you think I know fucking your guys' names? 
[03:33:30]  No.  I didn't.  That's why I just, I thought I would do it because I didn't think he'd recognize it.  So you didn't say, hey, this is intern Derek.  You said you don't, you said you didn't like interns Twittering the show, so I didn't do  it.  I didn't like show.  So he knew what he was doing was bad.  Right, right.  So he didn't like.  No, but I didn't show, I didn't show like my affiliation or anything that I was affiliated  with the show at all.  Why?  Because you think I don't like interns Twittering me because other people will see it or the fact  that I just don't want them Twittering me? 
[03:34:00]  Both.  No, it's pretty much, I don't want them Twittering me.  Okay, I'll keep that in mind.  So he's being deceitfully, deceitful on purpose.  Yeah, a little more deceitful.  You're very deceitful.  Yeah, you're trying to say you're not.  I don't, I don't try to come off as deceitful, but I believe so.  You're very sneaky.  Well, you did say you wanted to kill me.  Yeah.  Oh, I want to kill you, but for other reasons.  Was he specific?  What are the other reasons?  You just fucking sometimes are just so annoying.  How?  Look at that face.  Just the way, sometimes the way you are just annoys me, the way you talk.  I don't know what I'm doing.  You talk, you have such a fucking sunny disposition, it just annoys me. 
[03:34:30]  I'm sorry.  You're too happy all the time.  It's the new O&A.  Look at him go.  Amazing chemistry.  Yeah, they're doing a regular who's on first.  It's unbelievable.  Look at him with his hands in his pocket trying to control them.  Yeah.  You want to strangle something, don't you?  He is having a hard time.  Do you want to strangle me, Derek?  No, why the hell not?  Do it.  Ooh.  I would do it.  I just called you a pussy.  I did.  Wow.  Twice.  This is coming from, that's coming from you. 
[03:35:00]  That's coming from you, love buzz.  Strangle me.  Okay.  Strangle me.  I don't know what's going on anymore.  I don't know either.  The whole segment just fell apart.  It's just really weird.  Look at him.  His lip's quivering, man.  His lip is fucking quivering, dude.  That's a fucking telltale.  His eyes are falling down around him like a house of cards.  No, that's right before Dexter fucking sticks the knife right through the fucking saran wrap.  What happened to you, Derek, growing up, besides the racial shit?  How many squirrels did you fucking cut open in the backyard? 
[03:35:30]  No, I didn't ever kill an animal.  You ever killed an animal, had a cat's head?  No, I ran over a cat like a couple months ago.  A lot of people have.  But everybody runs over shit.  It's not right.  Rough childhood, what happened to you?  I was bullied a lot.  Yeah, we went over all that.  I think it's deeper than that, though.  Yeah, that was why he lied about getting mugged all those times.  You lied about getting mugged?  No, I didn't lie about getting mugged.  Oh, he lied.  That's a long story.  Really?  That ended with a lie detector test.  And by the way, whether he was lying then or lying now or when he was lying, he's told several interns that he did indeed lie on the lie detector test and got away with it. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah.  And what does that mean?  That you are lying to us?  No.  No, no, no, yeah?  No, I said it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, no.  There's a difference.  You want a yeah, yeah, no or a no, no, yeah?  Probably a no, no, yeah, yeah.  I like a yeah, yeah, yeah, no.  I think you want a yeah, yeah, yeah, no.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, no.  Yeah, yeah, that was a good one.  All right. 
[03:36:30]  Well, I guess we'll be keeping an eye on this one.  Yeah.  Um, you're going to continue calling, you know, you don't have a voice that blends in.  Yeah, I know.  Why don't you try changing it?  Like, try a deeper voice right now.  I tried.  Try right now.  Try talking deep.  Go as deep as you can go.  Say, uh, hi, Ron and Fez, it's Bill from Atlanta.  Hi, Ron and Fez, this is Bill from Atlanta.  No, you're not even trying.  I am.  No, you can hear the trying.  I can hear the trying. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah, but it's, it's not like, like, get, get down low like this.  Real low.  Go from there.  Get down.  Go, go from this.  Go from this.  Yeah.  To this down here.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Kind of just a little gravel to your voice, a little timber.  Yeah.  Go from a lollipop kid to a man.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Dirk.  Maybe I think I got it now.  All right.  Bill, some air came out.  He tried to say it, and air just came out of his, nothing. 
[03:37:30]  Wow.  Oh, my God.  What happened?  I really can't get my voice deep.  I've tried.  Just try it, try it, try it.  Go ahead.  I'll close my eyes.  Good, good.  Hi, Ron and Fez, this is Bill from Atlanta.  I really.  Wow.  He can't make his voice change.  I think even girls can do it.  Can you go higher?  Oh, I go higher.  Let's hear.  I've called up and pretended to be a girl once.  Yeah.  Damn, what?  What?  It actually works better than you trying to be. 
[03:38:00]  What?  He probably dressed up like a girl while he was calling just to get in character.  Just put on the fucking skin outfit he has.  What did you do as a girl?  Mother's skin.  My teachers, like when I was in like intermediate school, would call my house.  Well, I don't doubt that they thought of a girl.  Have you called radio shows as a girl?  You called Ron and Fez as a girl.  No, I never called Ron and Fez.  I called like Booker when he was on Free FM as a girl.  Did you ever take it in the ass like a girl?  It's just like a radio fuck.  Weird.  What's your girl's name?  I don't remember what name I was on.  Bobby, what's your girl's name?  I'm not telling you. 
[03:38:30]  Are you out of your mind?  I didn't want to tell you what type of hair she has or how big her tits are.  But why was he calling radio shows?  Yeah, yeah.  Like it makes sense because he's interning here that he would have to change his name for  Ron and Fez.  But why did he have to change his name to call Booker's show as a girl?  What was the girl's name you used that day?  It was like Ashley or something.  I forget.  All right.  And how does Ashley sound?  Let me hear the sound of a girl voice.  Go ahead.  Well, I called him and I was like, hi, this is Ashley.  And yeah, like that. 
[03:39:00]  And I read, hi, it's Jackie.  The joke, man.  But you know what?  They believed it.  Jackie will be on the show tomorrow.  Did you ever stand naked in front of the mirror and took your sack back?  No.  And dance in front of the mirror while you're making these calls?  Would you fuck me?  Would you fuck me?  I'd fuck me.  Wait, let me get my voice down.  You never pulled your balls back to see what you look like?  We've all done that.  Maybe not, Anthony.  I did it today.  Everyone's done the old fruit basket.  No, I really, I know.  You ever did the fucking dopamine pincher?  What's that? 
[03:39:30]  You bend over and stick your shit back and you bark a little bit.  Fucking.  You know, the dog's fucking stomach.  You are so fucked up, man.  You never did that?  I can't say that.  I don't know.  You never did that?  No.  There's no bending over when I pretend to be a girl.  I'm sorry, Bobby.  Did you ever try to mush your helmet into your asshole?  Never.  Me neither.  Me neither.  You never did that.  There's a video of some guy fucking himself in the ass and then he shoots a load. 
[03:40:00]  He fucks himself in the ass?  Yes.  I was at the fucking cellar last night.  You know, Artie Fuqua.  You've heard of him.  Artie!  Artie, funny guy.  He smiles as he beats the shit out of you.  Yeah, he's a fucking, just a delinquent.  He's smiling, nicest guy ever, and then he's getting arrested two seconds later.  Right, but smiling the whole time.  The whole time.  So you don't even know where it went wrong with this guy.  There was a rumor about his cock.  He had a picture of his cock on his phone, and I just go, I walked up to him, immediately,  show me it.  He showed me this photo.  He's resting this fucking mule on a table. 
[03:40:30]  Like, it's not even hard.  Impressive.  It's got to be 12 inches, not hard, resting on a fucking table.  Jesus.  I couldn't even get mine on, I couldn't, I don't rest my cock on anything.  It's just hard or not hard.  That's it.  There's no middle ground.  It's got to be detrimental.  You ever...  You want to bury it to the hilt, you know?  What do you mean?  It's like, a girl will be like, you know...  You want to go balls deep, Bobby.  You fucking, you got to, what, halfway in?  I don't think Artie could go balls deep.  That's so much easier, though.  You're just little pumps. 
[03:41:00]  The fucking work I have to put in to get my six-incher.  The best thing is bury in it.  I don't bury it.  I hear nothing.  Nothing.  I never heard, oh, or, mm, oh, God.  It's just a face.  It's just a face.  Wow.  Like she's looking at a wall clock.  Steven has from Bayshore.  Derek sounds like a lying progeria kid.  Yeah.  Got a little progeria in your voice.  Yeah.  So now, why do you call radio shows?  Just why do you call them at all? 
[03:41:30]  Bored.  I have nothing better to do.  So you're bored.  Sam's gone.  So you just listen to Ron and Fez and go,  I can contribute something here.  What do you want me to tell your mom?  Yeah.  What are you going to leave?  What are you going to leave me?  Leave you?  I want your eyebrows.  When you kill him, will you give me his eyebrows?  You know, you take souvenirs and shit like that?  Scalp his eyebrows, yeah.  Yeah, don't hide the eyebrows.  I want to make his eyebrows into an iPhone case.  Have you ever tried to give your penis an innie? 
[03:42:00]  Push it all the way in?  Yeah.  I don't try.  As a kid, you could.  What do you mean as a kid?  You know how many times I've ever said you could do that?  I could fucking do a little innie action.  I can do it on stage.  All the way in?  It just happens.  What?  It just goes in.  What?  Listen to me.  Wow.  I'm telling you right now, my shit will just pop in and I'll have to literally, on stage  sometimes, move around for it to pop back out so I feel comfortable.  Are you kidding?  I think I have diabetes of the cock. 
[03:42:30]  No blood goes to my dick.  It goes in on itself?  I mean, I can do this with my cock.  I can do one hand and then the other hand and a little thumb.  But that's pushing my balls down.  Like fucking almost eliminating my nuts.  But when it's, I don't have any hang at all.  Like it doesn't hang.  Right now, it's literally, it's right there.  One of the funniest visuals ever.  It's just right there. 
[03:43:00]  He's just tapping his groin.  He's tapping a little nub bump on his groin and saying that's his dick.  That's it right there.  It's sticking straight out at about a half an inch.  Yeah.  It's like, it's just like a dehydrated mushroom.  Hey, you want to ask the intern out?  The girl intern?  She's outside.  You have a girl intern?  You want to ask her out?  You want to?  No.  You like her, right?  She's got a really good voice.  Is she hot?  She's got that gravelly, like she's been out all night voices.  Kind of like the old school Demi Moore action. 
[03:43:30]  You could at least bring up your idea to her that you were going to say it on the radio.  She has a more manlier voice than him.  Yeah, definitely.  Maybe you should have her talk for you.  We got to show respect.  Ronnie will kill us.  Hi, how are you?  Hi, everyone.  Ronnie will kill us.  Nothing but respect.  Nothing but respect.  She's a beautiful girl.  Yeah.  Thanks.  You're welcome.  You're good looking, too.  Oh, sweetie.  I like her even more.  And the voice is that sexy.  Are you the one giving away $5?  Uh, $5? 
[03:44:00]  Just wondering.  I'm talking about fucking $10 for you, you sexy.  Oh, wow.  Look at that, huh?  They learn quick.  Fucking get out of here, Sam.  I'm not giving you anything.  You work for free, bitch.  New girl, did you know that Derek here was trying some underhanded tactics to go out with you?  I didn't know that.  They didn't tell me he called in.  Well, no one knew because he was lying with the name and everything and said that a great  suggestion for the show would be for you to date one of the O&A interns, knowing he 
[03:44:30]  would try to jump in there and say, I'll do it.  I used to do the same thing when I delivered subs for D'Angelo's.  I would call up.  I was a delivery guy.  I would call up and make a pickup order that nobody would ever pick up.  And at the end of the day, the guy would be like, well, you want this?  Nobody can.  FASA would take the sub.  What a great fucking scam.  That's brilliant.  All the time.  Brilliant.  What a great scam.  Oh, shit.  Oh, God damn. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah, so he's been trying to pull this scam the whole time.  Anything there, new girl?  I mean, he won't even look at me right now.  Look at it, dude.  But blink.  Yeah, yeah.  You got to blink if you look at her.  All right.  Yeah, you'll see that look as you start getting in that tunnel vision of life slipping away.  Like, that's the last thing you'll see.  It's just a circle.  Yeah, yeah.  As the sides start going dark.  It just closes in, gets blurry, and then you feel cold.  Hey, do you think he's cute? 
[03:45:30]  I mean, honestly, look at him.  Don't.  I know you're a little freaked out, but what's your vibe with this guy?  I think he has a nice look going for him.  Maybe not my type.  Can you not tremble when you say that?  She is trembling.  She's definitely not my type.  Petrified.  Why?  What's the problem with him?  As far as your type goes.  Maybe the facial hair.  Because it doesn't connect?  Yeah.  And it's, like, in between long or short.  It's just strange. 
[03:46:00]  It's because he can't grow it fully.  I'm sorry.  That's why I'm going to, because it doesn't fucking want to grow.  Well, yeah, because you...  Yeah, yeah, yeah, no.  You shave...  Yeah, no, no, no, no.  Yeah, yeah, no.  Is Love Buzz more your type?  Let's not get it.  Yeah.  Sorry, you don't have to answer that.  His lips look like they're undone.  Love Buzz has been caught multiple times slacking off on cleaning up the studio and talking  to a new girl outside the studio.  Yeah.  What is Love Buzz's problem?  Yeah, what's wrong with me? 
[03:46:30]  Retardation.  Wax lips.  His fly was unzipped.  How humiliating.  How embarrassing.  Oh, my God.  It's whatever.  Do you like her Love Buzz?  Yeah, she's cute.  What's her problem?  Ouch.  Ouch.  She doesn't really have a problem.  She has nice eyes.  She has beautiful eyes.  Yeah.  She's beautiful, man.  And for the record, yes, this is the second female Ron and Fez intern in a row that Love  Buzz has tried to flirt with. 
[03:47:00]  Well, I never exactly flirted with her.  We just talk.  There's no flirting.  Yeah.  Talking is kind of flirtatious in the workplace.  I guess so.  He talks in life like a shitty actor.  Yeah, yeah.  He really does.  I don't know.  Guess that one.  You know, you don't really talk in, you know, in life.  Yeah, delivering lines.  God damn it.  But bad lines.  Ronnie's very protective of you, by the way.  I see that.  Yeah.  I've noticed that.  Which means we should just stop right here because, you know, we're going to fuck it  up.  Yeah, but why don't you guys get these type of interns? 
[03:47:30]  Why do you always get guys with fucking jeans tracks?  We would get in trouble, first of all.  How?  Because we are not as respectful as Ron Bennington is.  We?  I would get in trouble.  I am not as respectful as Ron Bennington is.  Yeah.  We've had some.  I have a bad reputation, by the way, that precedes me, and it is not always true, by the way.  No one even said anything.  No, but you've heard Ronnie talk about on the air about like, oh, Anthony.  Yeah.  Look at you trying to clean up your fucking pack. 
[03:48:00]  Look at you, you scumbag.  You're trying to sweep it up, make it nice and neat.  I'm really not that type of guy.  In five minutes.  In five minutes, too, he's trying to do this.  You're trying to get it back to the compound.  I'm just trying to say.  As soon as you get in there, you're going to have to fucking kick some broad off the couch.  Clean up jizz in the pool.  Danny, you get home before me.  You clean that blood up.  I just got to call the wolves.  You guys hang out.  I know.  Would you ever go to the compound? 
[03:48:30]  I'm not sure about that.  Ron told me to stay away.  It's actually fun.  And it's just, you know, it's a pool and a bar and shit like that.  Guns.  He said you'd say that.  Guns.  Oh, he did?  Yeah.  What the hell is this?  He's really protecting her.  He said you'd say that, sir.  Yeah, but it would be also in the company of other people, like in a party atmosphere.  So it wouldn't be, you know, one-on-one because I'd be afraid of any allegations you might make against me, which would probably be completely accurate. 
[03:49:00]  Until he took you to his room like Otter from Animal House.  Fucking bar pops up.  The music starts.  There's a silk robe on that doesn't fit and his mules hanging out.  Jesus.  Sorry.  Come on.  That was my fantasy.  But Bobby's your type?  Who's Bobby?  Oh, shit.  Oh.  How many years in comedy, Bobby?  That's what the crowd will be saying.  That's what the crowd will be saying.  That's in my next CD.  All weekend.  Starting tonight. 
[03:49:30]  Who's Bobby?  Who's Bobby?  That's Bobby.  And that's your type?  More my type, yes.  Really?  Really?  Hang on.  You're like at least a little more clean cut, you know?  Right, right, yeah.  Incredible shrinking man kind of looking.  You guys actually have very similar outfits on today.  Yeah, we haven't noticed that.  Bobby and Anthony have the same shirt.  Yeah, but he looks better in it, right, Anthony?  A little snappy.  No, Bobby looks great.  Look at Anthony's arm.  Look at that muscle.  Wow, it's bulging.  Oh, I'm working out.  He's working out.  No, he is working out.  I'm working out, you know. 
[03:50:00]  Do you like a little chubby chaser?  You know, it's all about the personality.  Really?  Yeah.  I thought I actually had a good personality.  You do.  I gotta work on that.  Personnel.  Fuck.  You have a great personality, Anthony.  You're one of the nicest guys ever.  Thank you, Bobby.  You're smart.  You're intelligent.  You know how to protect yourself.  You make some money.  You got a beautiful house.  I'm generous to a fault.  I think Bobby wants to date you.  You're generous to a fault.  Yes, I am.  I'd fucking date Anthony in a second.  If you don't mind, I'd be at that house cleaning it up right now. 
[03:50:30]  You'd be the pool boy.  I would be there every fucking day.  Would you be the cabana boy every day?  Cabana boy, Bobby.  Oh, that'd be great.  What are you doing with Bobby?  What the fuck are you doing?  You're getting a little nervous over there.  I am.  I'm getting nervous because he didn't say no right away.  To being my cabana boy.  Dude, I'd be there every day in a little fucking Dutch G-string.  Ooh.  I'd pack in a sock just to make it look all right.  Send me a resume.  Let's make sure we're not getting electrocuted.  I'm just wondering, is there a, does this reputation that Ronnie has put forth, is that kind of a blocking thing going on? 
[03:51:00]  Because you do seem a little, you're a little pensive when it comes to me.  Yeah, Ron, I mean, I take his advice, and he didn't say don't talk to Anthony, but he said stay away from Anthony a little bit.  Because I try to like just even say hi to you in the hall, and you really do kind of like just, you go hi, you turn away, there's no further conversation. 
[03:51:30]  It's a little awkward.  Why is it awkward, though?  Because of what Ronnie said?  Yeah.  So it's all about what Ronnie has told you about me.  And everything you've said on Twitter, everything you've done in your fucking videocast.  No, no, but that could be one thing, because that's just, you know, me.  By the way, I don't act like this 24 hours a day.  I'd be committed.  It would be crazy.  Excuse me?  I don't know what you just said.  Radio Anthony is Radio Anthony.  It's me.  I'm not putting on a persona, but it's a lot more over the top than just regular life Anthony, who is, you know, I like having fun. 
[03:52:00]  I like enjoying myself and things like that.  But it's nothing to be petrified about, as Mr. Bennington has put forth to you, that I am some kind of a monster, perhaps.  Yeah, I don't think you're a monster.  I think.  Well, thank you.  I think I'm new, so I forget the, like, radio is different than off the air.  But you're kind of, I mean, it's Anthony, too, from the show, so it's a little intimidating, because he's who he is, too.  Well, I would hope not.  It's not like just a regular guy. 
[03:52:30]  Well, I never listened before I started interning, so now I'm learning.  Another good compliment right there.  Good.  Who are you?  I've never heard of us.  Who are you?  Who's Anthony?  Who's Anthony?  That's the sequel to Who's Bobby?  Yeah, it's on an FX right after Louie.  Who's Louie?  So, in essence, let me just wrap this up for everybody.  Are you Italian?  We can end this right now.  Top blocker.  Stop one second.  Do you date black guys?  Yeah, I mean, I haven't.  All right, so you're done right now. 
[03:53:00]  Wait, wait, you wait?  She has.  All right, everybody, we will be back tomorrow at 6 a.m.  Bob Kelly at Helium tonight.  Yeah.  Two shows Friday, two shows Saturday.  Come down, baby.  Come down.  Or, yeah, if you're in the Philly area, see Bob Kelly.  Tomorrow on the show, Jackie the Joke Man.  Yeah, Jackie will be on.  Stopping by.  Our new friend Colin Cain is going to stop by, because Jimmy's going to be down there in Atlanta.  What a great name, Colin Cain.  And we're going to get a Homeless Mustard update, supposedly 90 days sober and playing 
[03:53:30]  one of his first shows.  And make sure you listen right after our program to the Cockblocker and Fez show featuring the  intern f*** lover. </pre>
