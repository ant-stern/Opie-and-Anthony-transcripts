<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a furious response to a Stephen King Entertainment Weekly column criticizing their radio style, labeling them alongside "prank call" and "morning zoo" DJs.  Opie and Anthony vehemently disagreed, using extremely offensive language ("cocksucker," "asshole," "cunt") to express their anger towards King, arguing his criticism was hypocritical given the criticism he himself faces.  They defended their show's content, claiming it included insightful political commentary beyond pranks, and launched into a broader critique of stagnant radio, contrasting it with television's adaptability.  They reminisced about past attempts at modernizing their format and played audio clips of past heated exchanges with Carol Miller, highlighting perceived differences in their style and impact compared to older radio personalities like Cousin Brucey.  The discussion also touched upon the VMAs, with Kanye West's interruption of Taylor Swiftâ€™s acceptance speech serving as a case study in their critique of pop culture.

The Kanye West/Taylor Swift VMAs incident dominated a large portion of the show.  Opie and Anthony, along with their unnamed studio crew, reacted with highly offensive language, repeatedly calling Kanye West a "fucking asshole" and describing the event as an "assault" and a "mugging." They quoted Pink's strong Twitter condemnation of West.  The hosts speculated on how other rappers might have reacted, contrasting Kanye's actions with their hypothetical physical responses.  The conversation branched out to the incident's racial implications and impact on Kanye's career.  The show then offered highly critical assessments of the Michael Jackson tribute, Jack Black's performance promoting "Brutal Legend" (described as a "bomb"), and Lady Gaga's multiple costume changes, featuring sexually explicit descriptions and jokes.  Madonna's Michael Jackson tribute was analyzed and ridiculed, with the hosts focusing on its perceived hypocrisy.  The segment concluded with a discussion of the hosts' plans to attend Fur Fright 09 and the resulting online backlash and threats from some members of the furry community.  Listener calls were interspersed throughout, often contributing to the provocative nature of the discussions.

The broadcast continued with disparaging remarks about Madonna and Sharon Osbourne's appearances and plastic surgery.  A listener suggested "Google bombing" Opie's statement about Madonna, leading to self-congratulatory comments about the show's impact.  The hosts then discussed Derek Jeter breaking Lou Gehrig's record, Serena Williams' post-match outburst, and the changing nature of baseball doubleheaders.  Patrice O'Neal joined the show, contributing to the ongoing discussion about Stephen King's critique.

A significant portion focused on a Baltimore radio show seemingly imitating or criticizing Opie and Anthony.  The hosts played a clip, mocking their style and suggesting changes, including getting rid of the female co-host ("the hole"). They discussed the challenges of wit and profanity in radio.  The Australian radio prank gone wrong, involving a lie detector test with a 14-year-old rape victim and her mother, was discussed at length, with the hosts playing audio clips and reacting to the unfolding events and the Australian hosts' subsequent apology, suspension, and firings. The hosts imitated the Australian accents and slang, employing crude and sexually suggestive language throughout this section.  They also played audio from a stand-up comedian (Mickey) and Patrice O'Neal provided commentary.

Finally, the show returned to the Baltimore radio show, hosted by Mickey and Amelia, focusing heavily on the use of the word "cunt" in a previous O&A broadcast and its effect on Mickey's reaction.  Opie and Anthony extensively criticized Amelia, using derogatory terms, speculating on Mickey's discomfort and suggesting Amelia was hindering the show's success. They discussed the differences between terrestrial and satellite radio, referencing past controversies involving Michael Richards and Don Imus, and the role of their producer, Steve, in initiating contact with the Baltimore show.  Listener calls, including one from Mickey's producer (a huge O&A fan), were included. The show concluded with plugs for Patrice O'Neal's upcoming stand-up performances and mentions of other comedians appearing on Jay Leno.  Throughout the entire broadcast, Patrice O'Neal remained a guest in the studio.

[00:05:00]  the problem he's probably used to reading about you know shenanigans we've done and hijinks we've  gotten in trouble for the truth of the matter is on a day-to-day basis we come in here we serve up a  few laughs some information have some fun and um you know he's just lumping us in right and then called  us out right as like what as like the cream of the crop of these hacks yeah exactly which you know  exactly that's what kind of got me like oh oh mr king exactly yeah i mean our political rants and 
[00:05:30]  discussions rank right up there with anyone else doing that shit yeah yeah maybe news and current  events we're the best at it maybe he doesn't like our um our viewpoints sometimes but he brings it down  to prank calls and morning zoo type shit entertainment weekly it's i think it hits  newsstands i think today i don't know very very soon uh what's going to replace rock and roll radio  i can personally testify that it's on life support because i own a rock station in bangor maine oh wow

[00:09:00]  i don't like that yeah i saw you change i i that's what i love about anthony because i go you hear what  stephen king said about us and he's like no what all happy i'm like and i tell him he's like oh no  not stephen king at first i go through all those levels i go through all the emotional levels in one  minute there's denial and then anger and all those things i go through it in a minute and then it just  ends up mad forever within 10 seconds it was fuck stephen king fuck you fuck you you want to go to 
[00:09:30]  war stephen king i'll give you a fucking war so because stephen king says so  boy i sure hope larry king calls today to talk about the stephen king issue how important is the  king name all right so if i may wax vulgar as i continue with uh stephen king here in the entertainment  weekly pop culture column he writes ad revenues are in the pooper yeah well that's because uh the 
[00:10:00]  economy sucks radio sucks because there's too many commercials and there's nothing original there that  you can show an advertiser and go hey we're doing this uh wanting to advertise with us they go they  look and go what you're doing two for tuesday no but we call it double yeah it's two for tuesday  right uh sorry well we don't see any upside radio's in the toilet because there's no innovators out  there none whatsoever yeah none whatsoever the the commercial load thing was the death of regular 
[00:10:30]  radio yeah and the funny thing is about seven years ago i went to one of our gms i said hey i got a  weird idea listen to me why why do we have sex in various locations around no seven years ago oh yeah  i wasn't even working seven years ago whatever the year was i go hear me out but i think the 60  second commercials uh it's a bit long what if we did something entirely brand new on the opian anthony 
[00:11:00]  show and we only allowed 30 second commercials cut our commercial load in half yeah right  you're crazy i actually i actually suggested that because you saw everybody else kind of stomping  behind you like satellite radio yeah you're hearing about phones that might be able to play music  remember those days future though that'll never happen a mere few years ago the internet you're 
[00:11:30]  starting to get your music online i saw all the competition way in the distance i'm like man  you know what we're the leaders here we're way ahead of everybody but we got to really start  thinking yeah before these people that are way behind us start to catch up and that was my idea i said  how did they fucking uh uh battle it by doing two for tuesdays right right increasing the commercial  they thought i was crazy and they didn't listen to me and they were like oh you don't need to worry  about satellite radio no there's not gonna be a phone that you're gonna be able to actually listen to 
[00:12:00]  programming that's just that's crazy if man were meant to have a phone that played music he'd have  one right or something yeah add that to the uh those other fucking yeah technology things if a man  attains a speed of more than 30 miles an hour he shall surely perish that's right that's pretty  much an exact quote i love that one oops look i tried my best but uh the innovators uh left regular  radio and uh there's a bunch of dummies there that have no fucking idea how to turn this thing 
[00:12:30]  around you can't blame the economy you got to blame yourselves you got to blame the people that  are trying to to uh do radio programming you got the wrong people in place you have to be able to  improvise and adapt and uh that's one thing radio has really never been able to do they just continue  doing the same shit right uh and failing miserably and and the business goes down the toilet and then  they wonder what happened well let's fire this guy and drag in somebody else that's doing the same 
[00:13:00]  exact shit right and and then nothing happens again you know uh tv's doing a good job reinventing  themselves yeah they're trying they're they're doing a good job they're acknowledging that people are  getting programming uh elsewhere so guess what they're going to those places yeah if you want to  see more of this uh or lost behind the scenes or this blah blah blah go to our website or do this or do  episodes available right go to the website yeah and then you tune in regular radio what is it it could 
[00:13:30]  pretty much be the same shit they did 10 years ago they haven't done anything new and different and  exciting and as far as uh television using their websites to promote and actually play their  programming guaranteed their advertisers are also advertising on the websites because you see the  commercials being played right before you load up one of the videos and and there's pop-ups and stuff  like that so they're making money that way and what is radio doing with their websites all right they 
[00:14:00]  stream the show live but other than that it's hey the jocks right here's the bio right hey here's  fucking two for tuesday here's it there's nothing new on radio station websites that hasn't been there  since the fucking since the first website it's just done a little more flashy and a little better and  it looks better but uh the just the same shit look uh wxrk uh axq i mean uh here in the q104 it says 
[00:14:30]  that uh djs rock picks babes win which is the contest movies events news deep classics there's no  categories there that are any different than the ones that have been there for years none and in in  recent times a mere couple years ago when we were losing the battle as far as you know doing uh some  of our edgier stuff on radio yeah i went to the bosses i go all right well how about we have some of 
[00:15:00]  that stuff online online extras give away the what what as extra stuff but they wanted to keep their  websites clean like their radio program exactly not understanding that the fucking fcc has nothing to do  with the websites right and that advertisers uh obviously should understand that that the website  and the radio station are two different things when you have a show website you should be able to put  whatever the fuck you want on there it doesn't reflect the station uh and and especially when you're doing 
[00:15:30]  dick pill commercials and fucking uh you know uh cheating on your wife uh websites no kidding um maybe we  can you know it's not like we have uh american express and sears and shit like that advertising  on our shows we should be able to have a website that showed uh boobies right we weren't even allowed  to show a nipple no it was just ridiculous so you know they deserve everything they get that's for sure  this regular radio the bunch of dummies the innovators are gone the people that are in place have no 
[00:16:00]  fucking idea how to turn this thing around that's why you're going to get a lot of sports programming  out there you're gonna you're gonna get a lot of jukebox type programming out there yep and i i predict  a lot of foreign programming in the near future foreign programming right why i yes yes so we go back  to stephen king what's next for pop culture all right so what he says revenues are in the pooper  and this is true whatever the rock format pop oldies heavy metal middle of the road which i think of as 
[00:16:30]  the doobie brothers radio right now the only real radio rent payers are right wing ratchet jaws like  el rushbow what right now the old limbaugh right now the only real radio rent payers are right wing  ratchet jaws like el rushbow yeah if there's no rock and roll radio who's gonna find the great new  artists to make the little girl scream what when did that happen and and that's been happening uh 
[00:17:00]  um it's that pop radio it's just not happening on regular radio as much but people are discovering  their music in many yeah see mr king they go to other places they download their music they get it off  pandora they get it there's plenty of um satellite radio there's plenty um have you heard of something  called itunes it's kind of it's kind of a big deal these days yeah yeah yeah uh if there's no 
[00:17:30]  rock and roll radio who's gonna find the great new artist to make the little girl scream and this is  where it just gets ridiculous because he mentions us where are the djs like cousin brucey or carol  james of wwdc who is credited with playing i want to hold your hand first in america  how many years back how many years back you're gone i will never get this first of all cousin 
[00:18:00]  brucey broadcasts what two studios down he's a he's a nice enough guy and i have met him a few times  we got pictures with cousin brucey but let's be real the guy's a jukebox that's all he is that's all  he is what has he actually said on the radio that made you go hmm well made you think made you laugh  made you pissed off at the guy that's uh uh at him because he said it when was the last time  cousin brucey actually made made something happen with you emotionally because of something he said 
[00:18:30]  not the records yeah well he's like from the school of thought of like carol miller where it's like  i'm uh people's friend that was one of the best statements she ever made when obi's just lacing into  her going what do you do i i play the music i play no no no what do you do you don't even push  your own buttons like ali's yelling at her goes and then she just lost it went i'm people's friend 
[00:19:00]  every day they tune in to hear a friend i am someone's friend wdw wdw wdw  She does a couple shifts at SiriusXM.  I know.  I've heard her.  She still sounds like Carol.  It's fine.  I don't turn her off, but she's not going to make me go, hmm.  I'm not going to freak out.  Even when we piss you off, the radio listener, that we're doing our jobs.  Yep.  You're making people react to what you're saying. 
[00:19:30]  Whether it's make you laugh, make you think, anything.  But pushing a button and having some.  Travis has that clip.  Holy shit.  What?  Scooby-Scooby-Doo.  She says she's everyone's friend.  You want to hear that?  Yeah.  Well, E-Rock has it, too.  Which one do we play?  Which one's better?  Travis has less calories.  Sorry. 
[00:20:00]  So unnecessary.  I have no reason to do that.  Wait, which one?  He gets so mad.  Which one do you want to hear?  Because I like Carol hates ONA.  They're all fucking gems.  She yells that we're in 23rd place, which we were at the time, but then we made it all  the way to number one.  I know.  Which was a great radio story for the time.  It certainly was.  I yelled, Carol, you're stuck in the past. 
[00:20:30]  I asked Carol to resign.  This is just great stuff.  There were so many moments where I ducked my head down and just was like, oh my God,  I can't believe he's saying this shit.  All right, let's play the clip you're referencing.  Yeah, I want to hear the one where she says she's everyone's friend.  What do you do, Carol?  What do you do?  What do I do?  You can't even run the stupid board.  I can run the board.  I elect not to.  Why do you do it?  Why do you have to allow Eddie to sit here and push your buttons?  He points at you and you go, oh, WNW, the Black Rows are coming to the Beacon Theater.  I choose not to run the board because I enjoy it. 
[00:21:00]  You want to challenge me and you say, I'm not a comedian and I don't do bits and I don't  do a show.  You're serious.  You know why?  What do you do?  What do you do?  No, no, no.  Tell me what you do.  I'm not a comedian.  Tell me what you bring to the audience.  What is my role here?  Yeah, what is your role?  I'd like to know that.  Well, if you shut up for a minute, I'll tell you.  All right, go ahead.  Go ahead.  I've been people's friend for quite a long time.  We all grew up together.  Friend.  That's my role.  WNW, the years of Black Rows.  That is my role.  That is my role. 
[00:21:30]  When she came out with that one, I was flabbergasted.  Look, man.  And what a fucking lacing you were giving her.  I'm people's friends.  We're friends with some of our listeners.  Wow.  That's not your job.  No.  No.  It's not your job to be friends.  Friends.  When we meet the people that listen to our show, we love it.  We're very nice, believe it or not.  People are surprised by that, by the way.  Yeah.  But we'll buy you drinks.  We'll do whatever you want, basically. 
[00:22:00]  Un-fucking-believable.  But when you describe yourself as being, you know, someone's...  I'm people's friends.  I grew up with them.  I went...  What?  You're talking to a fucking microphone.  How friendly could you be with somebody?  I just don't understand.  And honestly, I have no issue with Carol Miller.  That's years ago.  Nah, it's water under the bridge.  And I like to say this, which might surprise people, but I actually respect her for attacking  us because we were at a radio station. 
[00:22:30]  This was about 10 or 11 years ago, where all the jocks thought like Carol Miller.  They all hated Anthony and I because we represented change.  It wasn't going to be about the music anymore.  It was going to be about what's being said between the records.  And they couldn't understand that concept.  They're like, this is fucked up.  What the fuck is this?  Well, other rock stations have been doing this for eight years.  And if this is the big rock station in New York, I think it's time that, you know, this  station does it as well. 
[00:23:00]  Right.  That was our theory on the whole thing.  Yeah.  And they were...  We told the stories.  I mean, they would hang up faxes.  It was all about faxes back then.  Faxes of how much we suck.  And they were all having secret meetings in the hallways about us.  And not one of them was brave enough to confront us, except for Carol Miller.  Yeah.  She was the only one that took us on because she believed in what she believed in.  Yeah.  She actually came forward and said stuff.  And if she makes a living, you know...  It is funny.  You know, spinning tunes.  You know, God bless her. 
[00:23:30]  And if Cousin Bruce, he continues to make a living by doing, ooh, then God bless him.  But for Stephen...  Cousins?  But for Stephen King to think it's relevant, that's where this is completely ridiculous.  And then he mentions this Carol James.  If we could look up Carol James.  I don't even know if it's a guy or a girl.  It's a name I went under back in the 70s when I was at WPLJ.  When I got my first friend.  Carol James of WWDC.  And I know a bit about radio. 
[00:24:00]  I study this shit.  I don't know who Carol James is.  Okay?  I just don't.  Who is credited with playing, I Want to Hold Your Hand First in America.  So his whole radio career revolves around the fact that he played a Beatles record first.  Who gives a flying fuck?  What does that mean?  Like, what really does that mean?  It's not like he probably said, wow, these kids are good.  Let me break them here.  And no, they were known. 
[00:24:30]  Right.  It's like, who gives a shit?  And I was, I re-watched Imagine, the John Lennon thing over the weekend.  And the Beatles were pretty fucking famous before they landed in America.  People forget that.  They were huge.  Huge in England.  In England.  And then they came over here.  And there was no real surprise.  At that point, it was very obvious the Beatles were going to do their thing.  Yeah.  When they landed, there were, what, thousands of people there.  Yeah, already.  Already.  Because they knew of them. 
[00:25:00]  So it's not brave that you're the first guy to play, I Want to Hold Your Hand, on American radio.  Yes.  That's not brave.  No.  All right.  And then, finally, Stephen King continues.  How culturally important are the gabbling personalities who make prank calls and own morning drive time?  Let's put it this way.  As far as I'm concerned, you could take Opie and Anthony and shove them where the sun doesn't shine.  Well, let me tell you something, Stephen. 
[00:25:30]  Sirius has done that.  We used to have windows.  And they have shoved us in a little studio where, indeed, the sun does not shine.  Yeah, so don't you worry.  So you absolutely got your wish, Mr. King.  Oh, God.  Why?  I mean, it's up to the listeners to decide, you know, that question.  How culturally important are the gabbling personalities?  You know how culturally important talk radio is?  It's a total reflection on what is happening in society as you're doing it. 
[00:26:00]  Are we the same show we were five years ago?  Are we the same show we were ten years ago?  No, because times change.  Culturally, things change.  And we change along with it.  We talk about things differently.  The political correctness of our society has affected the show.  It's very culturally important and relevant what talk radio does, regardless if it's what you call making prank phone calls and duty jokes or whatever,  or Rush Limbaugh or a music jock talking between the songs. 
[00:26:30]  I'll even give that that conversation cultural relevance because you are addressing the times, what's happening, how that music impacts people.  So, you know, so any jock speaking on the radio is culturally influenced and influential.  Right.  So what the fuck is he talking about?  And our serious conversations rank right up there with anyone else doing that type of talk.  I'm telling you right now, man. 
[00:27:00]  Just because we delve into the gutter every...  And I'm not downplaying.  A minute.  I love our edgy stuff.  I love our duty humor.  Funny.  And you know what?  The weird thing is we haven't made a prank call in...  Seriously, Anne, how long?  Since we got back...  It's been illegal.  Since we've been back on radio?  Yeah.  Maybe we did a couple when we first started back on XM.  We've been on satellite for about five years now.  So maybe, I'm not really sure, I'd have to look into the archives a little bit.  Maybe the first year we sort of were doing a few prank calls. 
[00:27:30]  But in general, the prank call has been taken away from us.  And the radio stations that continue to do prank calls, tearing down a curtain here, tearing down a wall here, they're all fake.  You're not allowed to do prank calls anymore.  No, you can't.  That is a huge no-no with the FCC, and they will come after you immediately.  Not allowed.  So what they do is they call people they know and whatnot because they still have a concept for a good prank call.  Prank call services. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, you know, it's an insult, to be honest with you.  And people are like, why do you care so much?  Because this business gets no respect to begin with.  And then you have someone like Stephen King just lumping us in with, you know, I know what kind of radio he's talking about.  We're not one of those shows.  No.  And that would be like, you know, lumping him into a general category for his writing.  I know.  I think he was way out of line on this one. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  And, you know, we give people a forum to discuss some serious shit that's going on in this country.  The health care, whether you like the president, whether you don't like him.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, we're all in with a lot of stuff, which is very relevant.  But he, you know, pops us in.  Same category.  Well, then let's pop you in with fucking Dean Koontz and, you know, everybody that you don't like.  Look, I mean, Carol James credited with playing I Want to Hold Your Hand First in America. 
[00:29:00]  Did he walk around for years bragging about that?  Yeah.  That's embarrassing.  I would never want to be known for that.  Who cares?  Who gives a shit?  Who gives a fuck?  What he's saying is like the good shit is so old.  How old?  I got to say, how old is Stephen King?  I think he's reached that, hit that wall.  I got to say he's, I don't know, he's got to be 60 something, right?  Is he that old now?  He's got to be, right?  Yeah.  See, that happens too. 
[00:29:30]  You see it happen with everybody.  They become irrelevant.  Like he's becoming, what, you can't have fun anymore?  You got to, you got to continue exploring and, and, and discovering.  And not losing your, your, the sense of humor that you had when you were younger.  Like I still find a lot of shit funny that I found funny when I was a kid.  Right.  You hear it on a daily basis here. 
[00:30:00]  Or I'm, you know, someone will say something ridiculously immature and I laugh my balls  off because I still find it funny.  Right.  What happens?  Do you hit a wall?  Is there a certain age where you all of a sudden go like, cause I've noticed there are  certain TV shows I don't really enjoy watching anymore and things like that.  Well, a good example, last night the VMAs were on and I was watching, cause I've been  watching the VMAs, I can't even tell you how long, and I'm sitting there going, oh my  God, I'm starting to not get this. 
[00:30:30]  And it kind of bothered me a little bit last night.  Yeah.  I'm like, am I supposed to find what Lady Gaga does?  Cool.  Snowball head.  Snowball head.  Bloody corpse hanging from the stage.  And I was sitting there going, and I got a slight panic attack.  I'm like, oh my God, I think it's finally happening.  I think I'm finally not understanding.  Oh no.  You know, parts of pop culture.  Well, there are some things you just can't.  That show, that show was horrendous.  Horrendous.  Yep. 
[00:31:00]  I didn't even watch it.  I saw the clips.  You didn't miss anything.  We're going to talk about it after the break.  I saw the highlights.  That's about it.  But for the most part, yeah, certain pop culture, I guess it just happens.  You know?  But it does happen throughout your entire life.  But you try, I guess the point you're making, Anto, you try to hang on as long as you can.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, hang on.  Because I think eventually.  Fingernails.  I would love to say that I'm going to be the only guy that discovers new music and new shit all the way up to the day I die. 
[00:31:30]  And hopefully it's when I'm older, a lot older, whatever.  But I think it happens to everybody.  So I think your job as a human being, if this is important to you, is try to hang on as long as you can.  Like, I'm not discovering as much music as I used to.  No.  But compared to people my age, I'm way ahead of them.  They stopped discovering music after Boston's third album came out.  For real.  They just, like, stopped.  And I would, you know, run into some of my old friends and I would try to talk about new music. 
[00:32:00]  I'm like, wow, you guys, what the fuck happened to you?  Yeah.  They just.  What's wrong with you?  There's still great music out there.  Yeah.  You kind of forget that.  And because certain movies and TV shows you watch and go like, well, yeah, not that not as funny.  Or I have no where I used to be compelled to watch it whenever it was on.  I'm just kind of like, I don't really care.  Yeah.  So, but things like, as far as my sense of humor goes, what I find funny, I haven't seen that change. 
[00:32:30]  Right.  And just when you read Stephen King's books, you assume, and I guess maybe this is a maybe the wrong assumption.  I don't know that he did have that quirky kind of weird sense of humor because there are some things in his book and his books that he writes that you're like, oh, my God, that's hysterically funny and really dark and or nasty or immature.  But what happens?  He's 61.  Yeah.  I'm 61. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  And then, yeah, you just forget it.  Right.  Well, there you go.  I mean, it's a bummer because I've always enjoyed his stuff.  Another big fan, James Norton, who, of course, is not with us today, but he's a big fan.  Of King?  Of Stephen King.  I can't wait to get his take on this.  I know.  Later on.  He's going to lose his fucking mind.  He comes back later this week.  That's going to be great.  Yeah.  Because he'll be all over the fuck Stephen King bandwagon.  Oh, he'll be right on the bandwagon.  He'll jump right on the bandwagon. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, boy, man.  Ha, ha, shit.  Oh, boy, will he.  Fuck him.  Yeah.  So I'm trying to get him on the show for real.  We'd love to.  Because I want him.  We'd be treated nice.  We ain't going to goof on him or treat him with any disrespect when he's, you know, on the show.  And one of the questions we're asking today, I would love for Stephen King to answer this,  but maybe a listener could answer this as well.  Why is Cousin Brucey important?  For real.  Why is he important for real?  And why is Carol James, and I'm not saying we're important, by the way. 
[00:34:00]  No.  But I would put what Ant and I do up against them any day, and I think we would win that battle.  You know why I think Cousin Brucey's important?  I'll even give him, I'll throw him this.  Because he's a fellow employee, and you don't want to get fired?  Exactly.  I'll even throw him this.  It was back in a time when he first got on radio.  It was back in a time where that really, that whole thing was kind of new.  You know, you look at it now, and it's antique. 
[00:34:30]  Is he still important then?  Now?  I'm sorry, no.  But back then, that was important and relevant.  Where he was, he had the biggest stars of the time on his show, doing interviews, meeting these people.  Even just spinning their music.  It's like, you know, all right.  That was, a lot of your entertainment came from the radio.  And you did only have a few stations to choose from.  And I guess the jocks were important. 
[00:35:00]  Like Wolfman Jack was important.  But really, what did he do?  He just had a wacky voice and talked a lot of weird, like fucking Scorch.  Kingdom of negative.  I sort of get what you're saying, but I need a little more.  Like, you know what I mean?  It's weird because it's a time thing.  It's like, why was Uncle Miltie important, you know?  You look at an Uncle Miltie TV show on an old kinescope, and you're like, this sucks.  Well, I listen to some of the old radio air checks, like a Wolfman Jack or Cousin Brucey. 
[00:35:30]  And it's cool because you're like, oh, wow, this is like nostalgia.  Yeah.  But I don't know.  I think you have to talk more than 20 seconds at a time to be important on the radio.  Yeah, that's true.  I've always thought that.  Because even when I was just doing music radio, I'm like, I'm nothing.  Who gives a shit what I'm saying in between these records?  Who gives a fuck that I'm doing a weather break?  True.  Or giving you a tidbit about the band I just played. 
[00:36:00]  I knew I was a zero when I was doing it.  No one really cares.  You didn't have to tell me.  That's why I started sneaking shit in there.  Because I'm like, I either start sneaking shit in there and develop into something, or I'm not going to do this.  This is a waste of time for me and the listener that is listening to this horse shit.  But they assume that's what people wanted to hear.  I was listening to Casey Kasem, American Top 40, because they play the old ones.  Yeah.  So it's like from 1977 or some shit. 
[00:36:30]  And that was kind of interesting.  Like in 77, I never would have listened to Casey Kasem doing the top fucking 25 countdown or whatever he did.  Right.  But to hear it now, it's like nostalgic.  You hear like what the number 20 song was.  And they don't even know that that's going to wind up being a number one hit that just gives it kind of an aside.  Yeah.  And talks about things that are happening in the world at that time.  So it's almost a nostalgia thing. 
[00:37:00]  Right.  I get that.  And I think that's what the old Cousin Bruce-y shit would be like.  Okay.  But now, they ain't going to listen to that shit now.  Who cares?  He's making a nice dime a couple studios down.  I understand.  It's not my cup of Joe, as they say.  And finally, we'll go to break with this.  Carol James, WWDC.  Why is it important that he is credited with playing I Want to Hold Your Hand First in America when the rest of the world was on board with the Beatles way ahead of us? 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  They were huge across the pond.  Why?  I have no idea.  Why is that important?  I have no idea.  You think he walked around just bragging about that year after year after year?  I was the first one to play it.  I was the first one to push the button to start this Beatles thing.  I think the more important thing is who handed you the record.  Right.  Because that's the person that went, hey.  Well, I have to back off a little bit on my attack of older disc jockeys.  There was a time where they were important to an extent because they did play. 
[00:38:00]  And they just brought in their own shit.  They played their own shit.  They were making a lot of the decisions of what was played on the radio.  So that I got to give them nothing but respect for.  But that drastically changed with the invention of the program director and the consultant.  The insultant.  And sales more important than programming.  Always.  Ugh.  I hate that.  So that's how we start today.  A big fuck you to Stephen King. 
[00:38:30]  And I would love to have this discussion with him.  For real.  We're sort of taking the high road except for a few fisting jokes and his wife is ugly jokes.  And maybe van jokes.  A tragic accident.  But besides that, I think we took the high road on this one.  You want to hear another Carol Miller clip?  Please.  These are older than dirt.  Let's close out with another Carol Miller clip.  I love it.  Carol hates O&A.  23rd place.  Asking Carol to resign is one of my favorites.  Carol's stuck in the past. 
[00:39:00]  Carol buys O&A enemas.  Last successful ratings, 1985.  Asking Carol to resign again.  Kicking Carol out.  Carol returns.  Carol's ratings.  Carol, Carol, Carol.  The challenge.  And Carol cursing.  Which one do you want to hear?  She cursed on the air?  Oh, yeah.  We got her so pissed off.  I want to hear that.  Because then she was at fucking meltdown temperature.  Why? 
[00:39:30]  What?  Yeah.  What?  You are.  Let me explain something else to the newer listeners out there.  There's a lot of people that probably haven't been on board with Opie and Anthony since probably just the beginning of XM they came on board.  You are hearing lunatic Opie.  This is an Opie that really has kind of changed over the years.  I'm trying.  A little bit. 
[00:40:00]  I'm trying a little bit.  A bit.  It's still right under the surface, though.  Really, it's bubbling.  It's been brought down to a little lower of a boil.  Not a rolling boil.  But you are hearing one of the biggest assholes on radio.  You were a prick when people would fucking get on your ass.  It was fantastic.  She didn't get under my skin.  No, no.  That's what I mean.  Oh, okay.  She would look at you like, this guy is such a fucking asshole.  And you would just keep fucking picking away at her. 
[00:40:30]  I was trying to get her to make her point.  And then I was making believe I couldn't really hear her.  I'm like, what?  And then I'm turning her mic off.  And what?  What?  What?  It was so painful to listen to and to watch.  We got to weave these through the entire show today.  Oh, hysterical.  Why?  What?  Yeah.  What?  It's so funny.  Better call the engineer.  I think something's wrong with the mic.  Yeah, bitch.  The Rock in New York, 1027, WNAW.  The Living Legend is next.  Can't wait to hear what comes out of her mouth tonight. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  You're a useless piece of shit.  Get out of here.  Oh, my God.  You're a loser.  You're a piece of shit.  Actually, you are it.  He is.  No, no.  I'm just as useless.  No, no.  I'm just as useless.  No.  Useless pieces of shit.  Unless you tried to divine and conquer and I was right there.  Yeah, yeah.  That would always work.  He's like, no, I'm a piece of shit, too.  I'm a justice useless cow.  No, I'm an asshole, too.  I just don't openly say it like he does. 
[00:41:30]  Goddamn.  All right.  That was some fucking classical shit.  All right.  Well, Brendan.  All right.  We're supposed to go to break.  Brendan.  Go ahead, Brendan.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning, Brendan.  I feel like Cousin Bruce.  He's nostalgic.  And there's something powerful about when he plays music.  Like, if it's a song that I don't really care for, but when he plays it, I don't know 
[00:42:00]  what it is.  Something about when he pushes those buttons, I just automatically love that song.  All right.  You're being sarcastic.  We understand.  You know what I do like, though?  I like that those old DJs, you know, the old people, they could feel like they're young  again.  Oh, I'm hearing Cousin Brucey, just like I did back in 1960.  Well, it brings you back to a time.  I understand that.  When we see an older movie or you turn on, I don't know, the 80s channel, it's like, 
[00:42:30]  oh, you know, the songs mean something to you.  Like, you remember when you heard it or what was going on in your life when that particular  band was, you know, popular or that song was real popular.  I get it from that respect.  But when I got into this business, you know, it was all about having a voice, which I never  had.  And I just didn't understand it.  When we went to NAW, it was all these guys bragging that they were there for 20, 25 years.  And I would look at it and go, but what have you done with your time for real? 
[00:43:00]  Well, nothing.  I mean, a few of the guys did some stuff.  They got to interview John Lennon and this and that.  But in general, it was all about just, you know, talking about the music.  Yeah.  Talk about the music.  Now we'll get back to what's important.  The music.  She'd do that, too.  She'd start a shift after.  Yeah.  Fucking.  I wouldn't acknowledge that we're trying to do something different.  Yeah.  She'd be like, oh, now that now that that's over with.  Yeah.  Now that distraction's done with.  Let's get back to what's really important.  The music.  Lit Zeppelin. 
[00:43:30]  Right.  Oh, you know what, Ant?  We go to break with this.  Phil in Atlanta just reminded us of something.  Yes, Phil.  You guys have always been kind of humble about this.  But, you know, before you brought it to America, Panzerfaust was just a German sensation.  And then you played Shit Dick.  You know, when we first played Shit Dick, do you think that's ever going to be in the history books?  Oh, and hey, they were the first ones to play Shit Dick from Panzerfaust Records.  We might have to play that at the break now. 
[00:44:00]  That wise-ass.  That's funny, though.  Yeah, just like Carol James, you know, we are credited, Anthony, for playing Shit Dick first in America.  Mm-hmm.  Jesus Christ.  We have a lot of firsts.  Unbelievable.  All right.  Shit dick.  A little VMA shit after the break?  Let us do that.  Kanye West is a complete loser.  At least he didn't, you know, bash us like Stephen King.  Fuck Kanye West. 
[00:44:30]  Fuck Stephen King.  Fuck Stephen King.  Right?  Yes.  Fuck him.  We've been at this a long time.  Lump us in like that.  Don't put us in that horse shit category.  Yeah.  We don't put you in the horse shit, you're just one writer category.  And then, you know, or if you'd think like that, put it out earlier so we didn't sit here like idiots complimenting you the whole time.  Right.  We're beyond radio.  We don't belong on radio.  No.  I don't know what medium we do belong on, but it ain't radio. 
[00:45:00]  We don't know how else to do this.  Yeah.  That's our problem.  Yeah.  We've never gone to a radio convention.  We barely hang out with other radio people.  No.  Because we don't belong.  They're doing this radio thing.  Misfits.  And we're doing our thing.  Yeah.  All right.  And, hey, we should talk some football.  I want to know who you follow.  Oh, shit.  After the break.  You don't have a football team, I don't think.  I don't think you do.  Not right.  Not right now.  I don't think you do.  I'll tell you, not right now. 
[00:45:30]  You're right.  All right.  It's all about something else.  Well, another week of radio is upon us.  It certainly is.  Whoopee.  A full week, too.  Yay.  Five fucking days.  Five whole days.  God damn.  Monday.  People like fucking getting up to work a goddamn jackhammer.  We're bitching.  Oh, stop.  And, look.  Enjoy ourselves.  Look, your pals, Opie and Anthony, we tried to change radio a long time ago. 
[00:46:00]  Here.  I'm going to go to break with this, Travis, and then you can play shit dick if you want  to.  Asking Carol to resign because she was part of the.  That was a good one.  She was part of the past, and Ant and I wanted to just have a radio station filled with assholes  like us.  Is this the pack you're sharing?  Yeah.  Carol, take all these CDs.  Look at them.  Look at them.  I'm looking at them.  I'll get a U-Haul truck.  Take every single one of these CDs.  Resign.  Take those CDs, and you can play them wherever you want.  And we'll compete and see who ends up in the top ten first.  Yes.  Oh, yeah, but I'll tell you one thing.  I'm going to make a deal with you. 
[00:46:30]  What?  If I play my CDs for a month, and you yak for a month and play yours, I bet you you go  down to 25th.  No, I don't think so.  I don't think so.  Oh, no, no.  I would like that bet.  No, listen.  Seriously, guys.  I love you.  If you're ready enough, resign.  Take all the CDs, and trust me.  There's so many radio stations in New York, so I won't pick you up.  I'll tell you all something.  You can take all these CDs and play them and see what happens.  I should trust you.  Yeah, trust me.  Now, why shouldn't you trust me?  Resign on the air right now.  Carol Miller's going to resign. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, kiss my ass, but you'd probably like it.  Come on.  Resign on the air.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  You resign on the air.  Resign on the air.  We've got to move forward here.  Resign.  Yeah, we are.  Take all these CDs.  I'll get the U-Haul truck and resign right now.  No, I resign myself to hopefully remaining in my seat playing the best rock of the present  past a future that I possibly can't.  Is it only a coincidence?  I'm WNW, the rock of New York.  The only people that are enjoying this is Carol, Scotso, and Dave Herman.  She's not going to resign.  No, I'm not going to resign. 
[00:47:30]  You can have all these CDs and resign.  No, you can have these microphones and resign.  You would have the best CD collection in the history of mankind.  You know, actually, we do here at WNW, and that's why we're playing it for you.  Oh, my God.  The company line.  This is my music, man.  Don't mess with my music. 
[00:48:00]  I used to love your imitation of Green Day, Ann.  You need a tissue?  There you go.  Yeah.  We like the Green Day, though.  Yeah.  They're still doing it.  They got crazy yesterday at the VMA's head.  Did they get crazy? 
[00:48:30]  Oh, listen to what Green Day did.  This was just insane.  They invited the fans on stage.  Oh, I'm sure they did.  It was just crazy.  It was crazy.  Because you don't know what's going to happen.  Very unpredictable.  Yeah.  This band, Green Day.  Of course they are.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Was it the fans that they invite in as the fans that are going to be on stage?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, pretty much.  They always do that at MTV.  Always.  Well, I like that at the Super Bowl.  We're all starting the halftime act, and then you just have a thousand fans out of nowhere 
[00:49:00]  come rushing the field.  It's like, wow, that's crazy.  They should be thrown off.  Oh, right.  It's all choreographed.  My new bit is, wow, that's crazy.  It's crazy.  When they do that.  Controlled craziness drives me nuts.  I hate it.  Because it's not craziness.  I think, who was it?  Was it U2 playing at the Super Bowl?  Oh, fuck.  Who was the band?  U2.  And all the fake fans come running in because they need a big crowd around the performer. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, they've got to fill up the front part of the stage.  And they have all these corporate signs, man, that says, like, Bruce Rocks.  It was obvious that even the signs were made ahead of time to keep it all safe.  That's crazy.  They did that with the Taylor Swift performance, too.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Outside, like, outside Radio City.  Oh, yeah.  Everybody just suddenly appeared.  Yeah.  It's so, like, yeah, choreographed insanity.  Well, wait, Travis.  Yes, sir.  I'm trying to get my new bit off the ground.  You say that, and then what do you say? 
[00:50:00]  Isn't that crazy?  You're asking, not telling.  You've got to say it in such a way that it drives a few listeners nuts.  Guys, that's really crazy.  Guys, that's really crazy.  Taylor Swift, I guess she performed on a New York City subway.  What?  A very gritty subway with homeless people and urine and rats running around.  Do you even know what that is?  What?  That's crazy.  Crazy.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  Actually, her performance was on a brand new, shiny subway. 
[00:50:30]  Of course it was.  And there was, like, people right out of Central Casting.  I love that one, too.  Oh, as subway riders?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everybody, the Asian people, the black people, the white businessman guy.  They had the business guy that's in a hurry.  Like, I've got to get to work.  And I'm looking at my clock.  Look, it's 9 o'clock at night.  That's crazy.  You're not going anywhere.  He's not going to work.  That would be crazy.  And then she starts her song as, like, a subway platform performer.  Yes.  I'm watching the video. 
[00:51:00]  Look, it's not too obvious with all the lighting and everything.  Look at her perfect makeup.  Because they're trying to make it sound like she really just did this off the cuff.  And then she jumps in the subway.  And then it's all these people from Central Casting getting ready to sing along with Taylor Swift.  Oh, God.  It was just crazy, Travis.  It's crazy.  Fucking Sam and his fucking Jay-Z t-shirt.  Wow.  There she goes.  Ripped it all off.  Yeah, look.  Now she gets on the subway and switches to camera two. 
[00:51:30]  Right.  And, look, everyone's just ready to play along with Taylor Swift.  Ready to rock.  Like, I don't understand this.  Why wouldn't you do that bit for real?  Yeah.  You know, you have a few guys around just in case, you know, some fucking-  He's got a little hairy.  Or some fucking pervert wants to show his penis on the fucking subway.  Well, that would be crazy.  That would be-  That would be funny to watch.  See, that would just be crazy.  Crazy.  That's crazy.  Real crazy.  But this is-  That's just crazy.  Taylor Swift, man.  Holy mother of God. 
[00:52:00]  Is she country or pop or the crossover thing?  She's now a crossover.  She's been known for her country music amp, but now she's moving into the pop world.  Where'd she come out?  A left field or is she from somewhere?  Travis?  Did she have hits as a country artist?  I really don't know.  I assume she must have.  I don't know.  I think that was her first album, but that's more of a Sam question because I know that he's  a very big Taylor Swift fan.  Is he?  Sam, what do you know about this Taylor Swift?  Homosexual.  I love Taylor Swift.  Well, first of all, I'm not a homony, actually. 
[00:52:30]  I love Taylor Swift.  She had a lot of hits.  She had like a-  Is there-  All right, but is there-  99 Problems?  Was that her?  Jay-Z.  Dude.  Oh, sorry.  I forgot.  Dude, there's a whole group of people that are killing me with this 99 Problems.  Who did it originally?  I don't care.  I just like the Jay-Z version.  Well, I mean, there was an iced tea song.  All right.  People are like, your favorite song by Jay-Z was done already.  Hey, that was great by iced tea.  See, it's a joke. 
[00:53:00]  It's a different song.  It's not the same lyrics to the song.  Yeah.  It's a different song.  But yeah, Taylor Swift had a song called Tim McGraw that was big.  Oh, yeah?  In the country world.  Okay.  But now she's a pop artist?  Yeah.  She had one of the hottest songs of the past year.  As far as MTV's concerned.  She does like pop country.  This is country.  This is country right here.  This is country.  Yeah, but her last album had a lot of pop country type. 
[00:53:30]  Mother of God, look at that.  She's wearing a little skirt today.  Jesus fucking Christ.  Kirk Tan.  Jesus H. Christ!  I'd follow her around, too.  We all wonder why they walk together.  What do you think?  I love how her goons are with her all the time.  All right, enough.  This is country.  But then she had like teardrops on my guitar and-  Aw.  What happened?  Our song. 
[00:54:00]  But she wasn't getting the exposure, I guess, because now she's in the pop world where you  get a little more exposure, in my humble opinion.  Well, this is her year.  Aw.  Is it?  Well, Kanye West fucked up her year.  But Beyonce brought it back.  I saw that at the end.  So, what's Kanye saying now?  Has he made any statement?  Has he apologized?  Or is he still sleeping?  He was-  Mars was just showing me some pictures that he was looking up, because he was looking  up pictures of Kanye West, for whatever reason.  And, yeah, Kanye West was like on the red carpet with a bottle of alcohol. 
[00:54:30]  Hennessy.  Yeah, he was all fucked up, apparently, before he did that.  Wait, who owns MTV?  CBS?  Yeah.  All right, let me tell you something about Kanye West and his bottle of Hennessy on the  red carpet.  I guarantee that was a fake fucking bottle of alcohol.  And, again, this is great iced tea.  You think it's iced tea in there?  Yeah, there he is with his bottle of Hennessy.  It might-  No, it's fake.  I'm telling you.  Yeah?  CBS, who owns MTV, would not allow- 
[00:55:00]  If we're not allowed to do an Asian joke, trust me, they're not going to let Kanye West  walk around with a bottle of Hennessy openly drinking, because that would break a few fucking  laws that would get CBS in some deep shit.  So, someone probably went, holy crap, he can't do that.  And then someone probably went to the bosses and said, no, actually, it's just a thing.  It's iced tea or something.  Don't worry about it.  What do you think of the MTV Music Awards there, Sam?  I like them.  See?  They were good.  They were really good this year. 
[00:55:30]  I'm finally losing touch.  I made a good run at it, though.  A lot of good performances.  Yeah.  Pop music is doing pretty well right now.  You know, I informed our own Sam of this earlier when I first came in.  Yes, Sam.  I'm really close to ditching him off of my Twitter.  Yeah.  Why?  Because I don't care about one fucking thing you tweet.  And you tweet a lot. 
[00:56:00]  Not a lot.  No, no, no.  Look, look.  Last night I was doing a lot of live tweeting.  Let me go on.  I'm going to look at my Tweety and see how many Sam ones are.  Oh, my God.  It's just that fucking cartoon head.  By Zoll.  Damn.  What's up, Beyonce?  That's one of them.  Here's another one.  Peace out, Kanye.  Lady Gaga is the new genius of pop music.  Why is she a genius?  Bad look for Kanye. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Pink and Shakira wearing the same dress.  WTF.  GTFO.  Yes.  Buzz Aldrin is about to punch a VJ in the face.  Primetime Sam Roberts.  Every MTV reporter.  Greater than.  Greater than.  Yeah.  I would have to say I would enjoy those tweets.  No, no.  Because I was watching yesterday.  Exactly.  After a wedding, a Jay-Z concert, and a J...  What?  J-A-P-W.  J-A-P-W show, what's on for today? 
[00:57:00]  You want to ask the morning?  I don't care.  Well, you want to ask the morning mashup about the Kanye West thing?  Open the door and ask him real fast.  What do you guys...  Hey, what do you guys think of the Kanye West controversy?  He's an asshole?  Wow.  For real, for real.  Asshole for real.  Damn.  Asshole for real.  Wow, that's going out on a limb.  All right.  There goes the morning mashup.  Black guy looked angry, though.  He did.  He did.  You see what Pink wrote?  Because Pink is crazy, too.  Pink's crazy. 
[00:57:30]  I wrote on my...  When it went down, I went, Kanye West, what a fucking asshole.  That's just a normal reaction you would have, whatever.  And then Pink...  Go to Pink's fucking Twitter.  She even said, and you can quote me!  Well, it's on Twitter, so...  It's already quoted.  It's her.  In print, it's there.  I think she might have got, uh, just, uh, Pink.  Yeah, look.  Look what she wrote about, uh, Kanye.  If you can read it, Danny, because it's very...  Uh...  It's very intense.  I think you gotta go down a little further. 
[00:58:00]  Keep going.  Oh, really?  Kanye West...  Okay, right there.  Kanye West.  Who wants to read it?  Danny, I think you should read it with your...  ...cold-fucking-Cain voice.  Um...  I don't know how to do that.  No, I'm just kidding.  Kanye West is the biggest piece of shit on Earth.  Period.  Quote me.  Quote me.  Quote me!  Wow!  That's crazy!  And then she goes, my heart goes out to Taylor Swift.  She is a sweet and talented girl, and deserves her moment.  She should know we all love her. 
[00:58:30]  Goddamn.  And then BeyoncÃ© is a classy lady.  Well, not all.  Kanye West doesn't love her.  I feel her, too.  It's not her fault at all.  And her and Taylor did their thing.  And Douchebag got kicked out.  Ha!  Ha!  So apparently, uh...  Oh, they kicked Kanye out?  Kanye got kicked out?  Rumors.  Rumors?  Well, if it's from Pink, she probably saw it.  Who's Pink?  She's there.  She's in the know.  She's crazy.  She is unpredictable.  Kanye West...  A lot of people, obviously, call him an asshole and pissed off.  This wrecks him, though. 
[00:59:00]  Does it?  Yeah, because he's not like a...  This isn't the...  He's not a hardcore...  Any news is good news.  No, he's not a hardcore...  If he was like a rap guy, a hard...  I mean, like a hardcore rap guy.  But he's drinking Hennessy on the red carpet!  That's just crazy!  No!  See, do you get the bit now?  People just do crazy things, Ed.  Oh, it's insanity.  I didn't even know.  Right.  Unpredictable.  No, if he was like, uh...  More like, uh...  I don't know.  Like a gangster.  He's pop rap.  And that's why this is really gonna hurt him. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  He pissed off a lot of his audience with this whole thing.  Yeah, his audience isn't into that kind of shit.  No.  His audience is into, you know, his music and stuff like that.  And that was like a diss kind of thing.  You don't diss...  Especially, uh...  Uh...  Very, very brave of him.  A little, tiny white girl.  That's anorexic.  Who...  Her fucking eyes...  That's the look you get from a bunny rabbit before you shoot it in the head.  She had a look on her face like...  What am I?  Blink, blink.  I'd like to see him go up there to his sister and do that shit. 
[01:00:00]  Mm-hmm.  Get up to fucking...  Some fucking sister is up there getting a reward and he comes up and goes,  Hey, bitch!  Let me tell ya!  Fucking Beyonce had the best goddamn video of it!  Right.  The bitch would be like,  What the...  What the fuck you say, Kanye?  Yeah.  And beat the piss out of him.  This little white girl's like,  I don't...  But the Negro's frightening me.  And I have the award, but...  It's somebody keeping the Negro away from me.  I'm very afraid.  She was petrified.  It was a good moment, though.  Oh, she was scared shit. 
[01:00:30]  It was like a mugging.  That's one thing I respect about MTV.  They still give you those moments.  Yeah, every so often.  Every so often.  But Kanye West, you make a good point.  I mean, imagine Jay-Z was on that stage and he was doing his, you know, thank you speech.  Fitty comes up there to accept an award.  Yeah.  And he goes,  Motherfucking Fitty!  You can't be this guy.  I've got a better video than you.  Dude, Fitty would have fucking taken that meat hand of a fist to his and plowed it into Kanye's face.  He would have been knocked the fuck out. 
[01:01:00]  Knocked the fuck out!  But he goes after the anorexic Taylor Swift.  Look at her.  Poor little girl.  Look how tiny her arms are.  Is being accosted.  Doesn't say much about Kanye West's arms, by the way.  Yeah.  They're not much bigger than Taylor Swift's.  But look at Taylor's little bicep.  You can't see it.  No, there's not a hint of a bicep.  She's a little skinny white girl.  She's got ligaments.  This is like, um, like a salt.  Yeah.  This is like an assault.  Oh, yeah.  This isn't going to help the black-white relationship. 
[01:01:30]  No, no.  This is going to be a problem.  This is every white guy's nightmare right here.  What we saw on MTV last night.  This was.  Well, you want to hear it?  Please.  Because you didn't watch last night.  It's worth playing.  I know it's everywhere today.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you so much.  I always dreamed about what it would be like to maybe win one of these someday.  Oh, no.  But I never actually thought that would happen.  Oh, no. 
[01:02:00]  She said, look, I've always dreamed about it.  Right.  She probably, as a singer, has dreamt about it, played it over in her head a thousand  times, how she walks out on stage.  They announce her name.  She walks up on stage, accepts the award, says the thank you, looks at her peers, and  then gives a touching speech.  And she dreamt about this.  Yeah.  And what happens?  Motherfucking cut!  You about a piece of shit to the white girl?  Beyonce, kick your ass!  This is like, this is pretty close to, like, Sleeping Beauty, just sleeping away, waiting 
[01:02:30]  for her prince, and there's a home invasion while she's sleeping.  Oh, shit.  She gets gang raped instead of kissed by the prince.  Right.  Fucking Cinderella, you know, trying to make it home by midnight, and she's accosted.  Accosted.  This Taylor Swift was accosted.  She was accosted on a stage in front of people and on TV.  Do you know?  This should be on, like, one of those craziest fucking police videos. 
[01:03:00]  And now we look as she's accosted on stage in front of thousands of people.  Fuck.  Can you imagine?  He looks like the biggest asshole.  He really does.  For real.  It's the best word for this.  Yeah, this is bad.  He looks like a complete asshole.  So this is her dream come true moment.  Right.  Right.  Maybe we could think about other, like, scenarios and dreams. 
[01:03:30]  Like, I went with the Cinderella and the Sleeping Beauty, but there's probably other ones out there.  Oh, wait.  If we could start thinking.  How about, like, a lot of girls have that dream wedding.  The dream wedding.  And it comes off without a hitch.  The dress looks beautiful.  It doesn't matter what kind of a slot the girl is.  She looks at herself like, I'm going to have a beautiful bridal gown.  And my husband is going to be the best guy ever.  And I'm going to have this giant wedding.  Both sides of the family love each other.  They're going to be looking.  We go to the reception afterwards.  Everything's fine.  Perfect.  Beautiful honeymoon. 
[01:04:00]  The guy makes love to her.  And it's the best she's ever had on Rose Petal.  And meanwhile, it ends up the family's fighting.  The guy's drunk.  He can't get a heart on.  Fucking relatives are just yelling at each other.  The food sucks.  That's what happened to her.  Oh, my God.  Boy, Kanye, real brave.  Yeah.  She might weigh 90 pounds.  She went like, oh.  She honestly couldn't believe she won. 
[01:04:30]  Well, look at her.  She wasn't a favorite, right?  No, she was nominated against heavy contenders.  She was nominated against Beyonce and Gaga.  And that Lady Gaga freak.  Well, come on.  She's an artist.  All right.  We'll look at you.  She's a performance artist.  Yeah.  How much attention does one person need?  Groom still smells like Hooker from the fucking bachelor party.  He's throwing up on himself.  And the best man.  He's got Hooker glitter on his fucking face. 
[01:05:00]  That's kind of what happened to Taylor Swift.  Yeah, exactly.  I guess she had a dream.  Look what happened.  Calm down a little bit.  This is, you know, Stephen King's listening.  I'm sorry, Stephen King.  Yeah, this is irrelevant.  Relevant.  This is Stephen King.  Wait a minute.  Fuck Stephen King.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Thank you so much.  I always dreamed about what it would be like to maybe win one of these someday, but I never 
[01:05:30]  actually thought that would happen.  I sing country music, so thank you so much for giving me a chance to win a VMA award.  Yo, Taylor, I'm really happy for you.  I'm going to let you finish, but Beyonce had one of the best videos of all time.  One of the best videos of all time.  Look at her.  Oh, my God.  And then they just, like, faded it out, and she's left there standing there like, I was 
[01:06:00]  just raped.  She had a Carrie moment, because then MTV and the people that bring you MTV fucked her  even harder, because that was a real moment that could have turned around nicely. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  But then there was some panicky Pete producer going, oh, my God.  Cut it.  Cut it.  Something crazy's happening.  All right.  All right.  Cut everything and dump the pig blood on her head.  Right.  Quick.  Right.  So that's what you...  Go to camera.  Shit.  It's the guy losing his fucking mind.  They all just suck.  So they bring in the music.  They cut the mic.  It's like, no, you could turn this thing around. 
[01:07:00]  Let the girl talk.  Stupid producer, take a breath, and the whole thing would have been a great moment.  All right.  Let's switch back to camera one.  Right.  Let's get the mic up on her and let her finish her speech.  Right.  And go.  Right.  All right.  So you get...  Ah!  Ah!  Spontaneous moment!  Commercial something!  Ah!  Ah!  Everyone's hearing in their earpiece, like, fucking black box recording.  No!  Riches are out!  Oh, my God!  Jesus!  Tell my wife I love her!  Let me come here! 
[01:07:30]  Oh, my...  Ah!  And then she's sitting there.  She tries.  She tries.  She was about to say something.  Yes!  And then all of a sudden, her mic's dead.  She's standing there awkwardly.  She doesn't know what to do.  She's stood there like...  Yes.  Like Carrie.  It was a Carrie moment.  She looked just like Carrie before Travolta pulled that fucking pig blood on her.  The producers are just as much to blame.  They really fucked her.  Yeah.  And then, of course, about 10 minutes later, she had to perform. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  Oh, great.  Yeah.  Did she do okay?  Yeah, because it was pre-recorded, Sam.  But the end wasn't around.  Oh, okay.  The end wasn't.  What the fuck?  I think the end was, too.  Kanye got up there and started singing.  I think the end was, too.  I think that whole thing was pre-recorded.  MTV does not know how to handle that spontaneity.  They freaked out.  And they were known for their spontaneity.  Yeah.  So you got a moment.  Deal with it.  And it's so obvious.  He walks off stage.  You're going to have something here.  Yeah.  Just keep the fucking mic on.  Let her finish.  Let her finish.  She ended with a standing ovation, by the way. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  Oh, fuck yeah.  If she would have been able to even...  We're just watching the Carrie clip now.  She's smiling.  Just kind of...  If she would have been able to conjure up something real quick, too, to make it kind of like Kanye  deprecating.  Right.  But keep it classy or something.  She absolutely would have gotten a fucking standing ovation.  Absolutely.  But MTV, oh, I don't know what to do.  Abso-fucking-lutely.  Kanye West came up and...  Oh, no. 
[01:09:00]  He grabbed the mic.  Oh, that's the most horrible thing I've ever seen.  Oh, my God.  She's standing there.  She doesn't know what to do.  Oh, the humanity.  Oh, no.  Get out of the way.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable.  Oh.  And where are all the tough guys that were in the audience?  Shouldn't one of them, like, ran on stage and said, what the fuck?  Keller Swift, you have go for throttle up.  Uh, we've had an anomaly. 
[01:09:30]  They just fucking freak out.  They just fucking panicked.  Handle it.  They went with the far shot with the camera.  They turned off the mic, and then they had the house band just, just play something.  Play something.  Get us out of here.  That's why TV, live TV just...  They can't go with those moments.  It used to be the last thing worth watching, because you just never knew what was going  to happen.  They cannot just go with those fucking moments.  They got everything in place, so, like, nothing too crazy happens.  Crazy?  You know, no, I didn't... 
[01:10:00]  I bailed on the VMAs.  I made it an hour there, Sam.  Why?  So then Diddy got up later on in the show?  Well, yeah.  Yeah, when they were going to introduce Best Male Video.  Okay.  And, of course, Kanye's nominated.  Of course.  And, like, the crowd won't even let him finish his...  Really?  Yeah.  They were done with Kanye West.  Yeah, for the people that are really pissed off at Kanye about this, and most people don't  give a shit, because, you know, what does it have to do with our lives?  But, uh, this fucks them.  Bad.  Yes.  In the end, it fucks them bad.  This year's nominees for Best Male Video keep it in the family. 
[01:10:30]  That's right.  Eminem and Jay-Z made Renegade.  Jay-Z gave us Kanye.  Kanye kept it going recording with Neo.  Now, I swear to you, I did not see this, Sam, but I want to stop it here.  Now, Diddy is known to be, you know, a gangster.  Yeah.  Oh, is he?  I don't know what he said. 
[01:11:00]  That's what I'm getting here.  Like, he has this tough, I'm a tough, fucking street kid made good.  Right?  Yeah, that's his reputation.  So, obviously...  Fucking Biggie's flunky.  Let's get it real.  He was Biggie's little flunky.  He was like, he was like, fuck, dad.  He's like fucking Too Short was with fucking, what's his name?  Right.  Oh, you, you got what I need.  Biz?  Yeah, Biz Markie and little motherfucking Too Short.  He's Too Short. 
[01:11:30]  Biz Markie just didn't die.  Too Short might have been able to do something.  Diddy runs this city.  Diddy runs this city?  Does he?  No.  That's right.  Which one is this?  It's Diddy.  Yeah, how many songs does he rip off in this one?  None.  Why not?  Yeah, we won't stop.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:12:00]  Turn this shit off, Sam.  You know what I get to the hook?  Is this Diddy?  Is this Diddy?  Yeah, the hook's good.  So what you trying to tell me, dear?  I got Bentley, Vincent, and Mr. Belvedere.  Mr. Belvedere.  And I just want to blow your mind.  I'm talking literally, really blow your mind.  My repertoire is menage a twis and exotic cars.  Chilling with the hottest dogs.  And it ain't no stop to this.  I can't help it, I'm an optimist. 
[01:12:30]  Optimist.  That's right.  You don't need the T at the end of the word.  Poetic license.  Oh, this shit!  The I, the T is Diddy.  Shut up!  Shit, the S, the H, the I, the T, the T, the Y.  Shitty.  He's shitty.  Could you turn this shit off?  You suck. 
[01:13:00]  I sound like my father now.  Turn this shit off!  Turn that down, you kids!  So Diddy is in the middle of another moment here.  He's on stage and they're now booing Kanye West, right?  That's true.  Nice.  What do you think Diddy does here?  I swear I didn't hear this clip, but I guarantee he fucking, fucking backs out.  Does he go, ya, ya, be cool, be cool, ya, ya, ya, be cool, be cool.  The D, the I, the T, the T, the Y.  Shut up!  He's spelling his name!  Wow!  Holy shit! 
[01:13:30]  Diddy would turn me around if he just said, you know what?  I agree with you.  And then said something like, fuck Kanye West.  Fuck Kanye!  Fuck you!  And then I would go out and get every Diddy record.  I would.  Cause I'd be like, god damn, this guy means business and he is the real deal instead of  a fucking, you know, fake.  I'll burn you a copy of him.  Hang on.  Let's see what Diddy does.  Everyone's booing.  There's a moment.  Yeah.  That's what Diddy does.  What, what happened? 
[01:14:00]  What, what did I say?  Neo.  Eminem.  Hey yo, everybody's just together on this one right here.  It's all in the family.  Wow.  You're real brave, Diddy.  What a fucking loser.  Diddy.  They're all a bunch of fucking phonies. 
[01:14:30]  First of all, he goes, oh, I can't get that out.  First of all.  It's Kenny, baby.  Oh, Kenny.  Oh, no.  CSK.  Retard in the house.  He only his ear.  In the serious his ear.  Oh, no.  2-0-2, y'all.  Let me tell you something.  Sometimes I rhyme slow, sometimes I rhyme slower.  That's because I'm a grower, not a shower.  Chilling with the chick, who I hope don't have a dick.  Cause if she do, I'll be out of there quick. 
[01:15:00]  Some G's are ballers, some G's are players.  Me, I just want to ball a player.  Six figures don't mean shit to me.  Cause it's too many zeros.  All I care about is Opie, my hero.  Not to mention Anthony, the coolest guy since OPP.  And Jimmy, too, who makes a big poo.  And smells his fart cause he's got a big heart.  Yeah.  And they're named O to the P, to the I, to the E, to the A, to the N, to the D, to the capital A. 
[01:15:30]  To the N, to the T, to the H, to the O, to the N, to the Y.  And let's not forget little J-I-D-O-M-Y.  I suck.  Opie and Anthony and little Jimmy.  Big shout out to the P, to the producer.  Oh, good rap.  That rules.  Wow.  A couple things with the Diddy clip.  First of all, he's like, what did I say?  Cause all these guys just think about themselves.  So he, so right away, Diddy thinks he said something crazy on stage. 
[01:16:00]  Doesn't even realize that there's a major, uh, controversy with Kanye West.  One of the names he just mentioned on stage.  Yep.  And then doesn't even take on this, this controversy.  Yeah.  Say something.  Cause it might hurt him in the business world.  God, you fucking.  Damn.  No.  I think it was racist.  I think race has something to do with it.  Here we go.  People are, people are saying that.  Oh, they're making racist accusations at Kanye West?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good.  So.  Good.  Good.  Beyonce did the right thing. 
[01:16:30]  She wins video of the year, calls Taylor to the stage so she could finish her speech.  Is this worth playing or is it's a long clip?  I don't know.  I mean, it's a nice clip.  Taylor gets her moment.  It's a nice clip.  It's a nice clip.  I'm clapping.  And it's a nice clip.  It's something maybe it's a little.  Oh, geez.  Who gives a shit?  Positive.  I want to bring her up.  Yeah.  Okay.  We got it.  Right.  It was nice.  It was nice.  The right thing to do.  Yeah.  Was it?  Yeah.  All right.  Some other things about the VMAs and then we'll move on. 
[01:17:00]  The Michael Jackson tribute was horrendous.  It wasn't that bad.  It wasn't really bad.  It wasn't that bad.  It was kind of cool because they had Michael Jackson on the big screen doing like Thriller  and was it Black or White or I forgot.  He did a whole bunch of songs.  He did Billie Jean and.  Yeah.  And they had dancers that were doing the exact moves as Michael was doing in the video  behind them.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  So that was kind of cool because it was all synced up.  But I think we've seen this whole synced up thing many, many times over the years where,  you know, some some broad sings with her dead father and whatnot. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because, you know.  Nat King Cole.  Nat King Cole.  Hey, you know, she's singing with Nat King Cole over here.  I don't think Nat King Cole wanted his daughter to sing with him.  Yeah.  Well.  Fuck that.  She was so fucking booted up on heroin at the time.  Right.  She had a bit of a problem.  So the Jack.  I mean, the Michael Jackson tribute was.  Yeah.  It was all right.  Janet came out and did scream.  Yeah.  Janet Jackson came out and did scream.  And she looked like she was still hurting.  Sam.  Really?  She's hurting over this whole Michael Jackson. 
[01:18:00]  Was Blanket there?  No, Blanket was scared.  Oh, they could have brought Blanket out.  He's frightened.  He's still frightened.  Kanye could have come out.  Let me tell you something, Blanket.  Your older sister is much better than you.  You wear a blanket on your head.  You look stupid.  All right.  I'll let you finish after this.  No Blanket.  No.  I just want to say that my daddy, I love to.  Blanket, give me the microphone, fucking bitch.  You're talking about Michael Jackson.  Fucking Joe Jackson said a lot better things than you did about Michael. 
[01:18:30]  Michael Jackson, shut the fuck up.  You don't even look like a man.  Cuts off our fucking speech at the funeral.  Really?  I just want to see Kanye jump in front of everybody.  There's a wake.  Ask not what your country could.  Shut the fuck up.  Right.  You ain't even a good Kenny.  What happened to your father?  You're the one with the problem.  I don't want to make all kind of money to get the fucking shit.  I want to talk about Martin Luther King.  Martin Luther King, now ask me.  Fucking Kanye.  Kanye.  Let's see how this works out for you. 
[01:19:00]  This is for Kanye in front of everybody.  Yeah, a couple more observations, Anthony.  Jack Black.  Oh, no.  Another embarrassment.  How do I even explain this one to Hank that didn't see it?  He bombed.  Was it a big bomb?  Was he doing a bit?  How many people watched the VMAs?  Millions.  I mean, in a replay.  Hundreds of millions?  Yeah.  Dude, he comes out.  This guy is officially so not funny.  Officially. 
[01:19:30]  Now it's official?  Yes.  Thank God.  Well, we were all kind of going, is Jack Black funny still?  You know, you're kind of on the fence.  He's officially so not funny.  You know what made Jack Black, in my eyes, verifiably not funny?  Someone like Seth Rogen.  Oh, fuck yeah.  I watch Seth Rogen and go like, now that's a funny motherfucker that's trying to pull  off the, I'm kind of a regular goofy guy, but he's really fucking funny? 
[01:20:00]  Right.  He can do it.  Jack Black, sorry, not funny.  I officially turned the corner on this whole Jack Black thing, Tropic Thunder.  He had a couple moments, but he-  Wow.  You think like before that he was funny?  I didn't mind him.  My moment was probably the one with the fucking Mars Attacks.  Where he's the sun.  I didn't see Mars Attacks.  That's a long time ago.  I didn't see Mars Attacks.  Oh, my God.  I didn't see it.  Ah, ah, ah.  I know he got that from there, but I, you know, I don't need to know where this shit 
[01:20:30]  comes from.  Of course.  I'm heading to a retirement.  What do I give a shit about?  No, but Jack Black comes on stage, Anthony.  Now, check this out.  He's promoting a video game called Brutal Legend, and-  Oh, right.  And they were trying to get Jack Black on our show to promote this horseshit game.  It's a piece of shite.  I hope they're not advertising with us.  Oh, please don't.  Let it be known.  I've never even seen the game, so who knows if it's-  Oh, shut the fuck up.  It's probably horseshit.  And we said, you know what?  Fuck Jack Black. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, we didn't-  Fuck him.  And he could go where the sun don't shine.  Oh!  If we may quote Stephen King, who was quoted in the paper.  Yeah.  And we said, fuck you, because when it came to these big blockbuster movies that he was  in, he ignored us.  And now he's got a horseshit project that he needs all the help he could get, and all of  a sudden he wants to come back on our show.  Bye-bye!  So it's like, go fuck yourself.  Go fuck all the movies you do from here on out.  We're done with you.  And we were there from the beginning with this guy. 
[01:21:30]  When no one really knew Jack Black, we had him on our show.  Yeah, and then he gets some celebrity, and he doesn't come on, and now he's got a-  Movie after-  Dude, movie after movie he wasn't coming on anymore.  And then when it comes to the horseshit projects, then he's more than willing to talk to us.  That dumb band thing that was cool for like a year?  Oh, God.  When he was still promoting that years later?  So anyway, Jack Black, he comes walking out.  Could you show Ant the clip?  I want to see-  Yeah, here. 
[01:22:00]  I want to see Ant's douche chill, the douche chills.  First of all, yeah, what has he got on?  It's like a muscle suit?  He's got a muscle suit, so he looks like he's ripped.  He's got a t-shirt that says Brutal Legend, of course, is the name of the video game.  Hat on backwards with some long black hair coming out the back, almost mullet-like.  Right, and he's got like Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Say that word, Ant, because I can't, obviously.  What, Brutal Legend?  Arnold.  No, he's got the big muscles, and here we go. 
[01:22:30]  Watch this.  Tell us about this look you're sporting.  This is just the result of many hours of push-ups and sit-ups.  Organic foods.  I spend a lot of time at Whole Foods.  A lot of steroids.  A lot of stretching.  Yoga.  Laps in the pool.  Backstroke.  Cheststroke.  Butterfly.  All of it.  You name it.  Can you flex a muscle for us?  I'll flex a muscle. 
[01:23:00]  This is my battle axe.  With this weapon, I slay demons.  If there be a demon in the room, I shall slay him tonight.  Or her.  Who do you have your eye on?  I don't know.  Who would you slay first, Rob Pattinson or Megan Fox?  I'll go slay Pattinson.  I heard he's encroaching on my fucking, on my turf.  All right.  I'll see you guys later.  Thank you. 
[01:23:30]  Dude.  Deuce chills.  For real.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's nothing funny about that.  There's nothing there.  And then he had to walk around with the bodysuit with the muscles all night long after he bombed  on the red carpet.  And then he bombed on the stage.  If you could find that.  Oh, he don't care.  He's like, he's promoting the game.  Huh?  He's promoting the game.  So he doesn't care that he's wearing the muscles and the shirt.  He thinks it's great, I bet.  You know, when Jim Carrey did his whole thing, he made it work with the long hair, kind of doing  the Jim Morrison thing. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  But the Jack Black, it's one of the biggest bombs I've seen on TV in recent years.  What is this stupid game about, by the way?  I don't know.  It's like a metal guy.  Yeah, you play Jack Black and you try to actually keep your career going.  Brutal Legend stars Jack Black in the role of roadie Eddie Riggs, a man who sets out on  an epic quest to build an army of rockers with only a broad axe, a big block V8, and his  faithful guitar in hand.  Rock.  Okay.  Let me just have the mic here a minute.  Let me just...  Let me tell you something. 
[01:24:30]  Goddamn Grand Theft Auto is a much better video game than I'm going to make a piece  of shit, Jack Black.  I'm going to let you finish, but Grand Theft Auto is the best video game ever.  That piece of shit you got to have up there.  But you're about to leave a roadie.  Why did roadie need a battle axe?  Fuck that shit.  You're stupid.  Okay, hit the mic.  Oh my God, cut everything.  Cut everything.  Pull the plug.  You don't have them on stage? 
[01:25:00]  They don't have that clip up there yet?  Yeah, it's worth checking out.  And then finally, Lady Gaga.  She had four outfits, Sam.  A lot of outfit changes there, right?  Costume changes.  Absolutely.  What was your favorite?  I really...  What was your favorite?  I got the biggest kick out of her post-performance pre-award acceptance outfit.  The big red covering the entire face and body in red lace with a giant red lace top hat. 
[01:25:30]  She just needs attention.  What is that?  The entire head and face and...  Look, can we Google bomb today, Lady Gaga needs attention.  Very simple.  Lady Gaga, performance artist.  No.  Lady Gaga needs attention.  That's why you're on in the middle of the night, Sam.  No.  What does that mean, performance artist?  It's like, you know, you...  Are you into Lady Gaga's performances?  Yeah.  Why?  They're awesome. 
[01:26:00]  Why?  Have you ever seen anybody that dedicated to their craft?  I was...  I definitely checked out that paparazzi thing she did.  She got half a cock.  Wow, that's a rumor.  Anyone else see the big camel toe happening during her performance last night?  And we can't do Asian jokes.  Look at that.  What is that?  The same company that told us not to do Asian jokes.  All right.  You got to zoom in on that.  She's got a lump in her pants.  I don't know what that is.  Holy shit.  Have that checked out.  Oh, costume changes.  Sorry.  Okay.  Sorry, Raven kid.  Look at what's going on. 
[01:26:30]  Look at that.  I don't know what that is.  She doesn't have a wiener.  There's some kind of wiener device going on.  Her clit's hanging to the left.  Yeah.  You know how you're...  Swaying.  You got to decide which side your cock falls.  She has to decide which side or...  All right.  That looks like a horse just before it eats the sugar cube out of your fucking hand.  When they go that...  Thing before they...  But that's like full camel toe on...  Oh, yeah.  On a MTV broadcast last night. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, hell yeah.  She's very dedicated to her craft and is doing something different.  She looked ridiculous.  She's sitting in the audience looking like a snowflake at one point.  It was awesome.  What does she have?  She had like a snowman head on.  Yeah.  How do you talk to a snowflake, Sam?  That's exactly...  She sees herself as a piece of art as opposed to a human being.  She looks stupid.  How would Damone talk to Lady Gaga dressed as a snowflake, Anthony, at the MTV Video Music Awards? 
[01:27:30]  I don't fucking...  It's beyond stupid.  It's not...  It's awesome.  She comes...  She's playing a piano and then all of a sudden she's got all this blood all over her and  then she dies in her performance.  Yeah, good.  See, look at that outfit.  I said that's the most awesome outfit.  That's silly.  That's ridiculous, Sam.  Yeah, I'm not saying...  And she was making a statement with the paparazzi song.  Like, you're gonna kill one of us.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Wow, that's really relevant.  Yeah.  It's a good song. 
[01:28:00]  No, it isn't.  Yes, it is.  Is this paparazzi?  This is paparazzi.  It's the best song on the album.  Is it?  Yeah.  How pissed is Madonna, by the way?  These are all Madonna songs.  They pretty much are like...  Madonna's like, fuck!  Madonna's yesterday's news.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  The day before yesterday's news, I think.  Quite frankly.  We don't have to listen to the whole song, Travis. 
[01:28:30]  Travis is like, hey, you didn't wave me off.  I'm gonna come in.  It's fine.  It's all jokes.  Let's say hi to Larry King.  You wave me off.  I'm landing, motherfucker.  For the first time this week, we say hi to Larry King.  Oh.  Food.  All right.  Question.  P. Diddy.  How important are the notorious B.I.G.'s coattails?  Ah.  Yeah.  He's made quite a career.  I don't know that.  It's not even a joke.  That's just fact.  Oh, all right. 
[01:29:00]  Look, I'm looking at the picture now.  Stop it.  She's a snowflake, Sam.  That's awesome.  It's not a snowflake, even.  What is it?  What was it supposed to be, Sam?  Help me.  This is it.  Did she want to look like Sam?  Because it kind of looks like your hair.  She looks like a Christmas wreath.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  A white Christmas wreath.  That's sitting in a bar.  Do you go up to it and go, hey, can I buy you a drink?  Well, I don't think she would.  Would you be so creeped out?  Is that a hat or a fake beard?  That's a serial killer, Sam.  She's making a statement.  About what?  This is what I'm saying.  You don't have to know. 
[01:29:30]  What's the statement?  You don't have to know.  Everything doesn't have to be clarified for you.  It promotes a dialogue.  I understand we're old farts at this point, Sam, compared to you.  But what fucking statement is she making with the Mickey Mouse fucking fucking...  Mickey Mouse bridal.  You know who her date was to the awards?  Who?  Kermit the Frog.  She's fucking nuts.  It rules.  How do you bring Kermit the Frog?  He's not real.  She bred the puppet, Kermit the Frog, and Kermit was talking.  And without the hand up its ass, it just sits in the seat next to you doing nothing.  Well, it didn't come out of the limo.  You didn't see it, you know, walk.  Yeah, really, Sam?  Just store it in her fucking front of her pants? 
[01:30:00]  No.  Is that what that was, Kermit the Frog?  Because you got a big clap.  Let me say...  Sorry, Stephen King.  Let me say hi to Brian in Philly.  Brian.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey.  Hey, um, did anyone notice it in that clip, uh, Jack Black kind of sounded like Anthony's  imitation of Rocco?  Hey, dude, I got a game out.  Yeah, dude.  Yeah, I did a little bit.  It was a tremendous bomb.  Why is she covered with Kermit the Frog puppets?  That's her Kermit the Frog outfit. 
[01:30:30]  That wasn't last night, but that she's...  Oh, thank God.  You know, she's worn that on occasion.  Sam, does she realize most people are just laughing at her?  And I don't think that's what she's, uh, hoping for.  She realizes she's creating a discussion with her art.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Cigars and Scotch, uh, is on the line.  He's very upset about the Taylor Swift thing.  Yes, uh, Cigars and Scotch.  Good morning, C.  C.  To the S.  To the D.  To the D.  What do you got, Cigars?  I think Taylor Swift's speech should have ended with, there was a time that I could have  had you shot for that. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, jeez.  Oh, shit.  That's a good one.  And then finally, uh, Rich in Jersey.  Rich?  Hey, boys.  Hey there, Rich.  I love you.  I love the show.  Of course you do.  I think it's ironic that, uh, a couple years ago, Kanye did that thing for the Katrina,  how George Bush hates black people.  Apparently, uh, Kanye hates white people.  Yeah, I don't think he'd have been that quick to jump up there if, uh, another artist who  was, uh, an African-American was up on stage and he felt that a white artist, uh, had done 
[01:31:30]  a better video.  I don't think he would have jumped up there as quick.  You know what?  I think race comes into play a little bit.  I definitely agree with you, Ant.  Yeah.  I definitely agree with you.  You know, he's, he's, he's coming, he's defending Beyonce.  Yeah.  I don't think she needs any defense.  She's doing quite well for herself.  Yeah.  Video of the year.  Video of the year.  Yeah.  She ended up winning the whole thing.  Fucking cover girl commercials and shit.  And basically what MTV was doing was just spreading the wealth.  They, they try to spread the wealth with their awards.  So even when Taylor Swift won, if you really want to get into this, if we were E! 
[01:32:00]  Entertainment.  You know what's going to happen next.  Let's be E!  Entertainment.  You give Taylor Swift that award.  So then you could give Beyonce the big award and everyone has awards and it's, everyone's  happy.  It's a feel good moment.  Yeah.  But Kanye couldn't wait.  No.  He couldn't sit there and wait.  Loser.  Like, fucking Beyonce video.  Fucking loser.  Holy shit.  What?  Is that Lady Gaga's name?  It's Gaga.  That's her peener falling out.  She doesn't have a peener.  Yeah.  What is that though?  She's a lady.  What the fuck is that?  It looks prolapsed. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  The left side of the vagina looks like it has major problems.  Like it has stroke, stroke mouth or something.  The right side, the right side looks okay.  Like Rocky's eye in Rocky 3.  I'm not an expert on her genitals.  She does, but she does have internal, not external genitals.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, Madonna's got to be pissed though.  That's all I think when I see this Lady Gaga.  Oh, is that her corrective surgery?  Is it really?  Wow.  She did something to her eyes, her nose, her mouth.  She's still got a big old nose.  You know what though?  She is one of those girls that is, she's almost hot. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  She comes in as a.  She falls just short of being hot.  I mean, just short.  Is she hot?  Let me.  Oh, we almost hit.  The car's going to the hotline.  It's almost hot and she's crossing over the.  Oh, she's jammed down the hot brakes.  Didn't quite make it.  See, Stephen King.  We're doing some pop culture shit right here.  I hope you appreciate it.  Yes, Stephen King.  Fucked hard.  Yeah.  Travis, do you have a little poker face for everybody?  You know the version I'm talking about. 
[01:33:30]  Can't read my, can't read my, no, he can't read my poker face.  She's got me like nobody.  Can't read my, can't read my, no, he can't read my poker face.  She's got me like nobody.  P-P-Poker face.  P-P-Poker face.  P-P-Poker face.  P-P-Poker face.  P-P-Poker face.  I won't tell you that I love you.  Kiss or hug you.  Cause I'm bluffing with my Muffet. 
[01:34:00]  I'm not lying.  I'm just stunning.  With my love glue gunning.  Just like a chick in the casino.  Take your bank before I pay you out.  I promise this, promise this.  Check this hand cause I'm marvelous.  Can't read my, can't read my, no, he can't read my.  Poker face  She's got me like nobody  Can't read my, can't read my  No, he can't read my  Poker face  She's got me like nobody  That is 
[01:34:30]  abominable  Well, at least he sings along perfectly  with the song. Unlike Kenny, he's all  over the place.  Jack Black sounds like Tank Hangerist.  Thank you, Uncle Luke.  Thank you. Let me say hi  to Jake, Anthony. Jake has something very  important to say. Jake.  Hey, good morning. Good morning, Jake.  How are you? I'm good.  Did you hear  how Madonna  said that little boys  love Michael Jackson? 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, Madonna, I guess, felt like she really  needed to do the right thing and  talk fondly of Michael Jackson  to open up the awards, and that was really, really  confusing. And I think  Ant did not see the VMAs. I think we should  play her whole speech. Play her speech  because, from what I heard... Can we get it for after the break?  She almost chastises the public  for, like, um, giving  him a hard time. Yeah.  Because once you're dead, I guess, you know...  What's next? Gary Glitter dies  and we fucking make him a saint?  Look, I understand that some of these... I touched kids. 
[01:35:30]  Some of these celebrities, they're never left  alone, but, I mean, Michael Jackson...  He was crazy!  No. He was crazy.  He was... Oh, wait.  There's a difference. He was crazy.  He was crazy. He was crazy.  Yeah. Oh, that's crazy.  Jack Black is crazy!  Michael Jackson?  Crazy.  Crazy. For real.  Yeah.  Just... Hey, crazy.  Can I add something, too?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sam is gay.  Oh, Sam.  You know... 
[01:36:00]  That's not... I mean, it's not true.  You know...  Because here's the thing that people have to remember.  Some of these musical taste doesn't determine sexuality, and I would hope that the Opie  and Anthony audience is a little more open-minded.  You know, most of our audience is very into the diversity, so I don't think you have to  worry about it.  By the way, because Sam's in studio, there's something else going on.  On my dumb YouTube channel, Opie Radio, I posted the video of Sam in the bunny suit.  Oh, yeah.  Because that might be what he wears to Fur Fright 09, which is... 
[01:36:30]  How many days off is Fur Fright 09?  32 days and counting.  32 days.  Sweet.  Wow.  Let me tell you what's going on with Fur Fright.  Ass sex between men?  No.  No?  If someone could get the comments from the video, they're threatening Sam, the furries,  whatever they're called.  Are they called furries?  No, they're called...  Furries.  Yeah, furries.  Furries.  Furries.  They're basically saying, if you dare go to Fur Fright 09, there's going to be issues. 
[01:37:00]  There's going to be problems.  Why?  Because you'll be making a mockery of it?  Yeah, that's exactly what I'll do.  So they're attacking my video.  Why?  Screw the actual video.  Go down and see if you can get a couple of these comments real fast.  Sam, go through.  Do you got any, Sam?  I can't see from here.  I can't see, god damn it.  It might have started a little further down, but they're basically threatening Sam if he  goes.  Well, they're calling us morons.  Right.  For the way we're treating... 
[01:37:30]  See, yeah, and this is another issue, I think, of closed-mindedness.  Right.  Well, you'll get to the bottom of it at Fur Fright 09.  Yes.  I'm not...  But they're very upset.  They're very upset, and there's a little battle going on between our listeners and the  people that like to dress like fucking Halloween.  Yeah, why?  All year long.  Why?  Are they upset?  God forbid we make fun of the fact that you walk around in some weird Halloween fucking  stuffed animal costume and have sex.  It's fucking bizarre.  I'm sorry.  When you say it like that. 
[01:38:00]  Right.  Yeah.  Cut out your coolie hole.  Remember?  Are they upset about the coolie hole?  Well, the rules of Fur Fright are that you cannot have your coolie hole.  But we will put like Velcro so the costume will cover your coolie hole, and then if someone  wants to take you, they can take the bunny tail, pull it like a doorknob, and there's  your coolie hole.  I see myself getting...  Just for the taking.  Thrown out of Fur Fright within five minutes of being there.  No!  Well, because now they're saying something like they now know what you're wearing, and 
[01:38:30]  when they see you, there's going to be problems.  Awesome.  I'll fight every single furry.  Yeah.  You're going to fight them now.  I'll fight every furry in that convention.  It's not prime time bunny rabbit.  It could be.  But I don't think it should be.  But we got to battle.  It's, you know, our listeners are against people that dress like stuffed animals.  Of course.  I don't know who's going to win this battle.  This is going to be a tough one.  Yeah.  Can we get Madonna's speech?  Fuck that video thing.  Yeah.  I just want to bring it to everyone's attention.  No, fuck that!  Madonna talking about Michael Jackson. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, I think...  All right.  Okay.  Okay.  Do you want to do it right now?  Madonna!  Okay.  Talk about Michael Jackson.  Well, you want to do this, Ant?  If it gets boring, then we'll stop.  Yeah, we'll just fucking go through it.  We don't finish half our bits.  See what happens.  Yeah.  Why would we?  We're half-assed.  Michael Jackson was a kid toucher.  She is so pissed right here to begin with.  Why? 
[01:39:30]  You'll see.  I have a little bit more to say than that.  Oh.  Okay.  Here we go again.  Michael Jackson was born in August 1958.  So was I.  Oh.  What?  Michael Jackson grew up in the suburbs of the Midwest.  So did I.  Oh.  Michael Jackson had eight brothers and sisters.  Uh-oh.  So do I.  Oh.  When Michael Jackson was six, he became a superstar and was perhaps the world's most beloved child.  When I was six, my mother died. 
[01:40:00]  Oh!  I never had a mother, but he never had a child.  Oh!  Michael Jackson had a black dick.  I've had a lot of them.  I spent my childhood searching for my mother figures.  Yeah.  And sometimes I was successful.  Others.  But how do you recreate your childhood when you are under the magnifying glass of the world for your entire life?  Oh, me-hoo-dee-hoo!  There is no question that Michael Jackson was one of the greatest talents the world has ever known. 
[01:40:30]  Shut up.  I have Twitter enemies.  All right?  Ah, there we go.  Now they all stand up.  All right.  So she should have stopped there.  When he sang a song at the ripe old age of eight, he could make you feel like an experienced adult  was squeezing your heart with his words.  That the way he moved had the elegance of Fred Astaire and pack the punch of Muhammad Ali.  That his music had an extra layer of...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.  What about Otis Redding?  Motherfucking bitch!  You're talking about Michael Jackson. 
[01:41:00]  I'm talking about Otis Redding singing on Dr. Bay.  It was a great song.  And you're paying tribute to this guy.  I'm not going to let you finish.  But goddamn Otis Redding was great.  You know what?  And he had no fucking shit.  You know what?  Say what you want about Madonna.  But if Kanye West interrupted Madonna, she would have ripped his fucking eyes out with  those nails of hers.  You're right.  She would have gave him a fucking beating.  Fucking Kanye.  But instead, he picks the anorexic fucking country chick. 
[01:41:30]  She made you believe that you could fly, dare to dream, be anything that you wanted to be.  A victim?  Because that is what heroes do.  And Michael Jackson was a hero.  No, he wasn't!  He performed in soccer stadiums around the world.  He sold hundreds of millions of records.  He dined with prime ministers and presidents.  This is working.  We're going all the way to the end.  Girls fell in love with him.  Boys fell in love with him.  Yeah, he fell in love with boys. 
[01:42:00]  Everyone wanted to dance like him.  Boys fell in love with him.  He seemed otherworldly.  Wait till you hear about the date they went on.  Oh!  Michael Jackson, you heard this, right?  Like most performers, he was shy and plagued with insecurities.  I can't say we were great friends, but in 1991, I decided I wanted to try and get to know him better.  I asked him out to dinner.  I put on a boy suit.  My treat.  I'll drive.  Just you and me.  Yeah.  Did you really drive?  He agreed and showed up to my house without any bodyguards.  We drove to the restaurant in my car.  Listen to this, Andy.  It was dark out, but he was still wearing sunglasses. 
[01:42:30]  I said, Michael, I feel like I'm talking to a limousine.  Do you think you could take off those glasses so I could see your eyes?  He paused for a moment.  And then he tossed the glasses out the window, looked at me with a wink and a smile, and said,  Can you see me now?  Is that better?  In that moment, I could see both his vulnerability and his charm.  The rest of the dinner, I was hell-bent on getting me to eat french fries, drink wine, have dessert, and say bad words. 
[01:43:00]  Things he never seemed to allow himself to do.  Later, we went back to my house to watch a movie, and we sat on the couch like two kids.  Listen to this, Andy.  And somewhere in the middle of the film, his hand snuck over and held mine.  It felt like he was looking for a friend more than a romance.  Yeah.  And I was happy to oblige him.  So I blew him.  And in that moment, we didn't feel like a superstar.  He felt like a human being.  Kind of limp.  We went out a few more times together, and then for one reason or another, we fell out of touch.  Yeah. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, because you said, holy shit, this guy's a fucking weirdo.  And it seemed like one negative story after the other was coming out about Michael.  Seemed like it?  No, it was.  I felt his pain.  I know what it's like to walk down the street.  I felt his pain right now.  I was trying against you.  Stop this bullshit.  You can back up slightly.  She felt his pain, really?  But didn't talk to him ever again, basically.  Really?  I felt his pain, but I felt it from a distance because I didn't want to be fucking tied to this idiot.  What do you think?  Like that lunatic Liz Taylor.  What do you think happened where Madonna's like, I can never fucking talk to this guy again? 
[01:44:00]  Maybe Michael Jackson pays child's family multi-millions of dollars to shut your yap by diddling him?  I'll tell you one thing, though, about this Madonna.  She knows how to eat an asshole.  Yeah, yeah.  I saw that picture in that book.  Danny just punched that one up.  Well, which is, I mean, you know.  Look at her.  Just let me see.  She knows how to eat an asshole.  Oh, God, is that a young gentleman's ass?  She's got her face buried in a young gentleman's ass who's wearing, like, a jockstrap. 
[01:44:30]  Would Lady Gaga do that, Sam?  I would say not.  Yes, she would.  With all the fucking masks she wears, how is she going to eat ass?  She'd just wear a hat.  You know how ridiculous it would be to eat an asshole dressed as a snowflake?  It would rule.  It would rule.  All right, back to Madonna, because this is, you know, she's doing the right thing for Michael Jackson.  I felt his pain.  Ow.  I know what it's like to walk down the street and feel like the whole world is turned against you.  Oh, really?  I know what it's like to feel helpless and unable to defend yourself because the roar of the lynch mob is so loud that you are convinced your voice can never be heard. 
[01:45:00]  Shut it.  But I had a childhood, and I was allowed to make mistakes and find my own way in the world without the glare of the spotlight.  Okay.  When I first heard that Michael had died, I was in London, days away from the opening of my tour.  Michael was going to perform in the same venue as me a week later.  Wow.  That's crazy.  All I could think about in that moment was I had abandoned him. 
[01:45:30]  Ah, you did.  Had abandoned him.  Yep.  That we had allowed this magnificent creature that once set the world on fire to somehow slip through the cracks.  Well, he was trying to build a family and rebuild his career.  We were all busy passing judgment.  Oh, fuck.  You just saved me.  Thanks, Anne.  Most of us had turned our backs on him.  Yeah, the young boys had to turn their backs on him, too.  In a desperate attempt to hold on to his memory.  They didn't want to.  I went on the Internet to watch old clips of him dancing and singing on TV and on stage. 
[01:46:00]  And what happened?  And I thought, my God, he was so unique, so original, so rare.  So perverted.  And there will never be anyone like him again.  Thank God.  Well, that's like Hitler.  You could say the same thing about Hitler.  So rare.  Did Jimmy Fallon look like he was going to start crying?  Yes.  What is with Jimmy Fallon?  I love Jimmy Fallon, believe me.  But he was also a human being.  Don't be so emotional.  And alas, we are all human beings.  He wasn't human. 
[01:46:30]  And sometimes we have to lose things before we can truly appreciate them.  I want to end this on a positive note and say that my sons, each nine and four, are obsessed with Michael Jackson.  Uh-oh.  There's a whole lot of crotch grabbing and moonwalking going on in my house.  I want you to pause this.  Pause this again.  Yes.  Yeah.  First of all.  Your sons are obsessed with Michael Jackson.  I got this in.  Yeah, yeah.  You go.  So your sons are obsessed with Michael Jackson.  And you can make one phone call when he was alive. 
[01:47:00]  And Michael Jackson could be the highlight of your kids' lives.  Yes.  Their little young lives.  Why didn't you call up Michael Jackson?  What about it?  To meet your kids.  Huh?  Exactly.  Another fucking phony.  And a lot of crotch grabbing going on.  Yeah.  Like, Neverland to me.  Ow.  Ow.  I can just see Madonna's kids going, do you want to play the victim this afternoon?  Or do I play the victim again?  Mommy, Michael hurt me. 
[01:47:30]  Right.  All right.  She's almost over with this horse shit.  And it seems like a whole new generation of kids has discovered his genius and are bringing  him to life again.  I hope that wherever Michael is right now...  Dead in the ground rotting.  ...he's smiling about this.  No.  You can't smile when you're dead.  Until your jaw falls off.  Until your jaw drops.  And then it kind of looks like a smile.  Then it looks like he's going...  Yes.  ...for eternity.  Yes.  Michael Jackson was a human being.  He can't do it. 
[01:48:00]  Damn it.  He was a king.  Long live the king.  Oh.  All right.  King of ghouls.  And she found a safe place to do that.  She wasn't going to do that at the memorial when everyone was like, what the fuck?  No.  And here's Madonna talking because they'd be like, oh, Madonna's persona non grata now.  Right.  God damn, yo.  That's some fucked up repugnant shit.  She looked like...  I had a fine tweet last night, Sam.  Yeah, you did.  She looks pretty hot for her age until she smiles and then she looks like Madam Muppet. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, the madam?  Yeah, it's weird with that plastic...  Whaling flowers and madam?  Yeah.  It's weird with that plastic surgery.  Like, you can look good until you smile.  Yeah.  Sharon Osbourne has that going on, too.  She looks unbelievable, the work she had done.  And then they smile.  But when you smile, then it looks like a kind of like a Madam Muppet thing.  Madam with the big fucking balls chin?  Yeah.  But then it separates the cheeks when you smile.  All right.  There's a separation between the cheekbones and the actual jawline and stuff. 
[01:49:00]  They haven't figured that out with the plastic surgery thing yet.  Yeah.  Throw some shit in there.  Yeah.  See, that's how most older women look when they smile.  They have pretty good faces.  Yeah.  But the smile gives it away that they're a little tight.  Does a new homosexual run Madam?  Because there was Whaling Flowers that ran her before.  And now it looks like a new homosexual is running that.  I'm not sure.  All right.  I'll check on that one. 
[01:49:30]  Marcel from Rhode Island wants us to Google bomb.  Opie says Madonna knows how to eat an asshole.  I don't know.  That's a long one.  Yeah.  And I don't know if we're going to get that one done today.  Oh, there you go.  Other people making the Madam Muppet observation.  Oh, wow.  Very good.  You know something?  Wow.  You know what?  You can't come up with anything that isn't already out there on the internet.  I'm on top of shit.  And I don't even know it.  We got Patrice O'Neill here?  Yes.  We could go home, Sam.  Did you hear the fucking two hours we just did?  You know something?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No one is doing better radio than we just did. 
[01:50:00]  That's true.  So can we take a half a day?  That's the reason why we stay a little longer.  Just to prove to everybody we can continue to do it.  It can only go downhill from here, Sam.  Incorrect.  There's something to be said about finishing while you're still on top.  Finishing on top.  How about leave them wanting more?  But they will.  Oh, yeah.  They're still going to want more.  Why?  Because you're the gods of radio.  The hope.  Jesus.  Opie, my mic.  Something happened.  Mars.  Mars, if we can get this mic fixed. 
[01:50:30]  Mars ain't going to help you.  When we get back, Derek Jeter passes Lou Gehrig as the Yankees' all-time hit leader.  I saw that one.  That was nice.  Lost the game, though, which was a little disheartening.  You see what the Red Sox fans did?  Acted like assholes in some capacity.  They actually fucking applauded FNW, my friend, for Jeter.  Oh, well, they weren't playing them at the time.  I think that's kind of cool, though.  Oh, well, no, that's an easy fucking dog.  That's kind of cool.  If they were playing the Sox when that happened, they'd have just been sitting there. 
[01:51:00]  Boo, boo, boo.  Boo, doo, doo.  Just like that.  Yeah, exactly.  17,000 fans just going, boo, boo, boo, boo.  You've never heard like.  Boo, boo, boo, boo.  Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.  It's a big loud crowd doing it.  I don't know if that translated very well, but I try.  Oh, my God.  And Sterling came up with a new word for Jeter setting the Lou Gehrig record.  Oh.  And Susan Waldman says things.  Oh, good.  We got that after the break. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, my gosh.  Also, Anthony, Serena Williams.  Yeah.  I wish I knew what she said, but she's in a bit of trouble.  She just lost her fucking mind until this open.  I think we got the post-match press conference from Serena Williams trying to explain herself.  But what?  There was a bad call.  And does anyone know what she might have said?  Well, she was accused of saying, I'm going to kill you.  Really?  Well, that's what she thought she was accused of saying.  But then she later said that she thought she heard that, but she misheard when she was 
[01:52:00]  accused of saying it.  Was Serena Williams at the VMAs?  Yeah.  I think she was, right?  Can you imagine?  She's up there doing her thing and Kanye West is up?  No.  You know how embarrassed fucking Kanye West would be after he gets a whooping from that  monster?  Oh, they sure wasn't Serena that said that and they thought it was Kanye?  Who could tell?  Actually, she's a lot bigger than Kanye.  A lot bigger.  Way bigger.  Yeah.  Bigger!  Stop it!  She could bench press.  People looking at me like I'm fucking... 
[01:52:30]  I got two heads over here.  People need to stop that.  She could bench press more than Kanye West.  Oh, yeah.  Also, when we get back, you know, my team is just the best right now.  The Jets.  The pink team.  The Jets, Anthony.  Football.  You're still stuck on this dumb baseball thing while we're all watching football.  Baseball's over as soon as football starts.  You know that, right?  No!  We're in the fucking tail end of this here.  Really?  It's ready to come up to October, my friend.  We're all focused on fucking football and you're still wasting your time with this baseball 
[01:53:00]  thing.  Move on.  The season's over.  Number one Yankees.  And we got two Monday night games tonight?  That's pretty crazy.  Or is that crazy?  That's...  Wow, let's make a lot of money.  You think?  You know what else I thought was interesting?  The doubleheader.  Remember the doubleheader when you were a kid?  They'd play a game and you'd sit there and then they'd play another game.  Right.  Now they do this thing where they play a game.  Everyone gets the fuck out.  They got a whole new group of people in the stadium and play another game. 
[01:53:30]  So it's not like a real back-to-back.  They used to take, what, 20 minutes between games maybe?  Wait a minute.  You'd sit there and get something to eat?  You just taught me something.  I had no idea this was going on.  Yeah.  I didn't either.  Now it's hours.  A few hours go on between the games now so they can rotate the fucking stadium crowd  and make twice the money.  I swear to God, I had no idea.  No shit.  What if you got tickets for both games?  Well, then I guess you could, you know, if you got tickets to the same seat, if you're  like, what, if you own the seats?  No, I bet you they would still make everyone leave, right?  They probably have to get everyone the fuck out, and then they clean up, do everything, 
[01:54:00]  whatever they do, and then they...  When did this start?  It's probably a few years.  I have no idea.  Mad Dog?  He's crazy.  He's crazy.  Watch out for Mad Dog.  So we got that.  Football starts, so baseball's over.  I don't know.  No, it's not.  I don't even know what I'm trying to do here.  Yankees, Yankees.  I was trying to do something, but fuck it.  Go to commercial so I could eat my cold sandwich? 
[01:54:30]  Let's do that.  Patrice is going to join the program?  Yes!  Oh, I saw Jim Jeffries.  I know what it was, just to hopefully keep people hooked.  I saw Jim Jeffries at Caroline's, and he fucking just killed.  Killed?  He was great.  And there's a young comedian named Colin Cain I want to just give a plug out to.  He was pretty fucking funny.  Colin Cain.  I've seen him a few times, and he's pretty fucking funny.  ColinCain.com if you want to check him out.  But after the show, Jim Jeffries was asking me about the Australian radio prank that went  horribly wrong.  Oh, right.  And I remember sort of hearing about it, but I didn't hear the actual audio, and Jeffries 
[01:55:00]  is like, trust me, fucking get this audio and play it on Monday.  So Sam got it, and it's amazing.  It is so good.  This is the biggest fail in radio.  Yes.  Don't even spoil it, though.  Huh?  Don't spoil it.  Fail.  Because when we were doing the Sex for Sam thing, we knew we were taking a chance, and  it could go wrong.  Could go wrong.  But these people had no clue that they were fucking going to fail horribly.  It was all fun and good times.  Yeah.  We'll explain after the break.  Stay there.  Thanks for listening. 
[01:55:30]  We welcome Patrice O'Neill to the show.  Absolutely.  And we couldn't be happier.  I'd like to say thank you to that.  It's a busy day, man.  There's a lot going on in the world.  We just did about an hour on the VMAs.  We're talking about football.  Very interesting, the VMA conversation.  Oh, my God.  I was into that.  I was listening to Steven Spielberg.  I mean, Steven King.  King.  Trashing us out of nowhere.  Steven King is...  What's that guy?  He has...  That's CNN? 
[01:56:00]  Oh, that's Larry King.  That's Larry King.  Steven King's the horror writer.  The horror writer?  Okay.  Steven King...  You read any of his books growing up?  Never read them.  Why?  They were always a movie.  That's what I say.  Fucking his...  He writes like two-page letters that end up movies.  My problem with Steven King, he gets a little wordy at times.  From a short story.  A little wordy.  A short story to him is what?  450 pages?  All his best stuff was not horror. 
[01:56:30]  Like, his movies end up being good.  Shawshank.  Shawshank and Misery, maybe.  But it's like they take...  And it's those ones that they take from those short stories.  Like I said, it's like this thing was nothing.  Nothing.  And Stand By Me was another one that was a biggie.  Boring.  And Christine...  Made a lot of money.  You know, he made a lot of fucking movies, man.  So why does he hate you guys?  I missed the first 20 minutes.  We're pretty much like radio hacks.  Speaking of which, all of radio just taking us on today.  We'll get into that in a second.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Wow, we got some crazy things being said about us today. 
[01:57:00]  Crazy.  This is what Steven King said.  It's in a...  He does a pop culture column.  And even though I hate his fucking guts now,  he still does a good job with this fucking pop culture thing.  Take the personal, like, hatred for you out of it.  Is it good?  Yeah, I...  If he said it about some other fucking diss jockeys?  Oh, we'd be laughing.  Ah-ha!  He kind of made a point,  but the problem was he lumped us in with all the other assholes.  Like Morning Zoo shows.  I think we've proven ourselves by this point that we're above radio. 
[01:57:30]  Morning Zoo?  We like to say we're above radio.  And people are like, what does that fucking mean?  We really are above all other radio shows.  How do you describe Morning Zoo?  Just the voices?  Morning Zoo is the fake voices.  The...  At 8 o'clock every morning,  they'll have the call with the guy that makes believe he's a plumber.  And, you know, it's just that type of...  Predictable.  Very hacky.  Set times to do things.  Beep, boop, boop, boop, beep, boop.  Okay, our contest lines are now lit.  And we're gonna...  Everything has to be overproduced 
[01:58:00]  because they don't really have anything going on.  So if they overproduce it,  you might trick the listeners into thinking  they're hearing something important.  So Stephen King takes on radio a little bit.  And this is where he mentions us.  He writes...  This is in the latest issue of Entertainment Weekly  coming out very soon.  Where are the DJs like Cousin Brucie  or...  Listen closely to this, Patrice,  because I don't get this one.  Or Carol James of WWDC  who is credited with playing  I Want to Hold Your Hand by the Beatles  first in America. 
[01:58:30]  That's his claim to fame  that he played a record first in America.  Sometimes when you listen to this stuff,  you got your brain and your ears ready for more.  Is that it?  And then it just stops.  That's it.  Well, then he talks about us.  But I want to stop there  because we're trying to figure out  why Cousin Brucie is important in radio.  And made a good point.  Like, listen to Cousin Brucie now.  Absolutely not important whatsoever.  It's more a nostalgia thing.  But when he was doing it,  I guess it was important for the time. 
[01:59:00]  If that makes sense.  Yeah.  And that's why we don't really understand it.  Because he didn't really say much  in between the records.  We don't understand people  that don't say much in between the records.  Why they're important.  And also,  was there program directors back then?  Or you get to choose  what's a hit song back then?  That's the one thing we did give him credit for.  That there were a lot of DJs  that actually turned you on to music  because they were picking  their own music for a while.  But that's just not the case anymore. 
[01:59:30]  Even Cousin Brucie's not allowed  to just sit there and go,  well, I'm going to play this  like obscure song from Blah Blah  because it doesn't fit the format  that he's on it.  So are they saying  this person created?  She's the one that's created a...  We don't even know if it's a she.  There's two R's and two L's in the name.  So it might be a guy.  Could be a guy?  I don't even know.  And I know radio.  Carol James.  A guy?  I don't know.  It's a guy like Carol O'Connor.  That played what?  That played a song?  He played a...  I want to hold your hand  first in America.  The Beatles song  that started it all. 
[02:00:00]  So what do you got?  The first FedEx?  Because it was already out.  That's what we were saying.  It was everywhere.  It should have been the guy  that handed him the fucking record.  That was the first guy  that pushed the button.  Right.  Thank you.  That's what we're saying.  And what was I trying...  The Beatles were already hitting  all over the world.  And so it wasn't even taking...  It wasn't taking a chance.  So Stephen King...  So he hates you for...  Because Cousin Brucie plays music?  He wants guys like Cousin Brucie  and this guy, Carol James,  that played  I Want to Hold Your Hand 
[02:00:30]  first in America.  Then he writes,  how culturally important  are the gabbling personalities?  And he puts personalities  in quotation marks,  which I agree with, by the way.  who make prank calls  and own morning drive time.  And that's the morning zoos  that we're talking about here.  Prank calls.  We used to do real prank calls  where we're like,  holy shit,  we're going to get  fucking in trouble for that.  But I'm becoming that guy too, though.  The guy that Stephen King  is becoming?  Yeah.  We were talking about that.  Yeah, we were talking about that too. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, I'm that guy too.  We're trying to hold on  to understanding culture.  I think we all lose in the end.  But you try to hang on  as long as you can.  As long as you can.  You become irrelevant.  Right.  Like, just the fact is  that every boy,  every man under 25 can type.  Growing up, if you typed,  when I grew up,  you was a faggot.  Immediately.  You were a sissy.  Immediately.  You fucking pussy.  What, do you want to be a secretary? 
[02:01:30]  Right.  There was no reason  to know how to type  in growing up.  None.  None.  But now I'm irrelevant  in case I had to go  and actually get a job  in the workforce  and I told him  I can't type.  Right.  I'm a fucking dinosaur.  They would look at you like,  what do you mean you can't type?  So Stephen King  is becoming irrelevant  right where he needs to  because his books  have to be by now.  No one reads anymore.  I don't even understand  why there's bookstores.  There's a few at the supermarket.  There's a book place  and then there's Barnes & Noble. 
[02:02:00]  But he's a guy  that no one would care about  and you've got to understand  what he's saying.  I would love to know  where reading is at these days  as far as books.  Guess what I bought.  I like reading books.  Okay.  But lately,  I just don't have time  because there's so much  other stuff to read online.  You're busy with your phone.  You know what I mean?  I bought the Art of War  by Sun Tzu on iTunes.  Yeah.  For your Kindle.  Joe Pack Natalia.  Joe Pantaglia 
[02:02:30]  or Joe Mantegna  is reading Sun Tzu  out of war to me.  So what the fuck  am I reading that shit for?  Right.  So then he says this.  So I agree with the  gabbling personalities  who make prank calls  in our morning drive time  and I'm like,  right on, Stephen King.  Right on.  We feel your pain.  We've been yelling  and screaming about this.  And then he ends with this.  Let's put it this way.  As far as I'm concerned,  you could take Opie and Anthony  and shove him  where the sun doesn't shine.  Why you guys?  I know.  Thank you.  That's why I'm confused. 
[02:03:00]  Because up to that point,  I absolutely agree with him.  Let's be honest.  Let's take this and be...  No, he's lumping us in  with this whole  morning zoo shit.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  He...  He...  He...  Of course he doesn't know  the names of anybody else.  Maybe he just sees you  as the top level.  He grouped you in.  Mm-hmm.  But you are a name enough  for him to fucking say.  You understand what I'm saying?  But we like to think  we're way in front.  Well, get off your own dick, 
[02:03:30]  motherfucker.  Maybe.  Fucking be...  You're presumptuous.  Maybe you're not,  you motherfucker.  Yeah.  Jesus, Mr. Ego.  You know what?  Leave Stephen King alone.  You're...  You can be right about that  too, Patrice.  You can be right about that.  But we like to feel like  we're way ahead of it.  I want to think  I have two million dollars  and people should come  see me when I go out  to perform.  Yeah, really?  You knock me down a peg  and I certainly deserve it.  You're right.  Jesus, you should have said  how dare you  in that fucking speech.  Yeah, I know.  Leave him alone.  We don't... 
[02:04:00]  We don't like...  We really don't  pat ourselves on the back,  trust me,  but something like this,  it gets your blood boiling.  Like, what the fuck?  Let's be honest.  He is...  He's done.  Hopefully he'll write you  in as a fucking character  in one of his books.  Yeah, that'd be nice.  You guys are shitty radio guys.  Evil ghosts.  Yeah.  Or just to like...  He was listening to bad radio.  Opie and Anthony,  I think it was.  Like, he'll fucking write that down  in his book.  The radio.  Evil radio.  Evil radio.  With a clown's nose 
[02:04:30]  and be on the front court  in a house  with a microphone.  He puts us in  some horse shit novel,  all is forgiven.  Are you kidding me?  Oh, yeah.  You can say whatever  the fuck you want.  Are you serious?  A fucking ABC,  a miniseries  with Stephen King?  And then,  this segs nicely  into what we want  to talk about next.  E-Rock brought to my attention  that some radio show  out of Baltimore  just decided  to start trashing us.  Yeah.  A show I've never heard of. 
[02:05:00]  This is pretty...  It's always a show  you've never heard of.  Always.  And I want the backstory  on this,  why they're trashing us.  Their phone number  is 800-767-1098.  Someone might find  that number interesting.  Yeah.  1-800-767-1098.  I think I know the story.  He gave E-Rock  a cue to run down the hall.  Is he running down the hall?  Oh, my God.  Is he?  Well, first you'd see  the water looking  like Jurassic Park. 
[02:05:30]  And then...  Oh, no.  Well, Steve is.  No.  Steve's kind of trotting.  No E-Rock, though.  Why?  E-Rock?  I don't see E-Rock.  I don't even see E-Rock.  You brought this  to our attention.  Why wouldn't you be,  you know,  close by  so we could  get the backstory?  I don't want Steve's  version of the backstory.  Hi, Steve.  Where's E-Rock?  He's in the back.  He's in the back.  In the office?  I was back there, by the way.  So why isn't he coming down?  Because he sent me down  to give you the backstory.  No, I like...  Steve was handling  all the backstory, by the way. 
[02:06:00]  Huh?  I was in the office  watching the whole thing.  Steve was vigorously  handling the backstory.  All right, you can help out.  E-Rock, what's the deal  with this show in Baltimore?  98 Rock.  I think we used to have  some friends on that station  for a while.  Yeah, Mark and Lopez  or something like that,  but they're gone,  so it's this new show.  And apparently,  somebody on their show  listens to our replay  as they go in  to do their show  in the morning.  All right, so they're a fan.  Yeah.  Mentioned it.  What's the problem  with being a fan of our show  if you work for another radio show? 
[02:06:30]  Well, apparently,  the hosts of the show  weren't happy  that the producer of the show  listens to us.  Ah!  Fine, they're not on yet.  Yeah, who cares?  Who cares what you listen to  before you fucking come in?  By the time we found out  and we checked their stream,  we only got about a minute of it  before they went to break.  What, they were trashing us, though?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Another fucking jealous radio show.  It's great.  It's so great to listen to, though.  It's just jealousy.  I don't even know these guys.  They certainly know who we are.  Nobody does. 
[02:07:00]  That happens when you go to satellite.  You become, I mean, it just...  Yeah.  There were moments  where I laughed out loud  on the way.  They're hilarious.  Don't get me wrong.  Opie and Anthony are hilarious.  Hold on.  So what's the problem?  Who is this?  Is it Danny Bonaduce?  Is it Rocco?  Is it fucking Bubba?  Is it...  Maxwell.  Maxwell?  Which radio voice,  same radio voice fucking guy  is this?  Holy shit.  That whole voice thing  where they talk like this.  And Pond. 
[02:07:30]  It's...  Is it Man Cow?  Is it...  What's with the fucking...  All right, look.  Every time...  By the way,  this isn't a replay, people.  I know.  This isn't a best of a replay.  This is another fucking guy  that has the same  stupid fucking voice.  Instead of being jealous,  why don't you listen up  and learn a little something here?  Yeah.  You're not standing out on radio  because you have the radio voice  that we talk about all the time.  Yeah.  Like I just said.  There's a million guys  that sound exactly like you  because you're using the voice. 
[02:08:00]  Stop using the voice,  first of all.  I used to listen to them  all the time in New York.  I just like it better...  Sounds exactly like Rocco.  I don't know.  Maybe it's just me.  Or Bubba.  When it's cleaned up, you mean?  Not cleaned up.  It's just when there's a little bit of...  It's harder to be witty  without using profanity.  Some restraint,  some subtle...  Is it?  Is it really?  Because we were on the fucking radio,  regular radio for years,  and we did both at the same time,  satellite and terrestrial radio,  where we were under a lot of restrictions,  more than you are, by the way.  Let me say something.  I'll tell you that.  We were under the most restrictions ever. 
[02:08:30]  Witty is overrated.  Clever...  Motherfuckers have somehow moved  clever and witty into funny.  Just because I can understand it  and get that you're trying to...  What you're trying to do  doesn't mean a fucking thing.  That's true.  When I was a kid,  you was funny as much as you could be.  And I'm going to tell you,  fuck sometimes makes things funnier.  Yeah, just adding fucking...  Asshole, douche, cocksucker.  Right.  When we grew up,  we would use words, swears, 
[02:09:00]  and it would make things as funny  as it could possibly be.  Watch an R-rated movie  and a line where they cut it out on TV  isn't as funny as the way the line was written  where the guy goes, you know, fuck.  Yeah.  I wouldn't put the premium on clever.  It's just like to say that  and then get offended by it.  It's just like...  It's a horseshit argument.  I'm not getting offended by the fact  that they're saying it.  It's a cop-out thing  that's been used so many times.  Oh, this...  We did both.  We did that and we did satellite. 
[02:09:30]  And I guarantee if these fucking assholes  went on satellite radio,  every other word coming out of their mouth  would be shit, fuck this, cunt.  You know, what, are you going to sit here  and just do a regular show?  You talk like you talk to your friends  in normal life.  And the fact that somebody would say  it's harder to be funny without swearing  is telling you  that you're working to be funny.  Like you're not just able to be...  So with my constraints 
[02:10:00]  of language and everything else,  I'm still able to be...  I can be funny.  You're with...  It's...  Just...  Whatever.  Well, let's continue.  I don't know the dudes,  but it's like, you know...  Dude, I don't...  That's...  Never heard of them, dude.  It just stinks of jealousy.  We don't even owe you.  Let's give a listen.  How much does that suck  that we don't even know you?  Yeah, of course.  Some restraint, some subtlety.  Yeah.  I mean...  Yeah, I mean...  It is a guy's show, though.  I think what that format does,  it just takes...  It knocks creativity down a little bit. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  Just by nature.  Look, if I had a satellite show,  I'd be the same way.  It's a different palette to work from.  Yeah.  Well, hold on over.  They look like the Bizarro U's.  A different palette.  Yeah, a little bit.  A different palette.  It's like...  It's like fat face Opie.  And...  Like old school...  Old school 1996 Anthony.  And then Jim Norton in there a little bit.  And then Jim Norton,  who didn't shave,  and some hole.  They have to have a hole, huh? 
[02:11:00]  Let me guess.  They say that Jimmy's not funny,  I betcha,  or something about Jim Norton,  who's gonna be on Leno tomorrow night.  Yeah, well...  Because these guys like to take shots at Jimmy.  That's the Bizarro U's.  That's not funny.  But neither one of them are funnier than me.  That is a fact.  I will walk on stage  in front of their entire audience,  and I'll do my...  I'll do a half hour,  an hour,  an hour and a half,  whatever,  and then one of them walk on  and do the same amount of time,  and at the end,  let the audience judge you.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy Norton's on the show, too.  I'm not funnier than Jim Norton. 
[02:11:30]  Well, maybe I am.  I would say you are,  only because Jim Norton's  just not my cup of tea.  But you know what else  that Opie and Anthony don't have?  The Baltimore Ravens.  We'll be right back with Jared Johnson.  Ah, that's a good way to end it.  Good way to end it.  What?  By the way,  it'd be waiting a long time  for me to go on stage.  And he said in front of...  You know how fucking famous we are,  you asshole?  He said in front of our audience.  You think I'm going to Baltimore  to some dumb,  dumpy comedy club  and doing a battle with you?  Go fuck yourself.  He said in front of our audience, 
[02:12:00]  which is hysterical.  Oh, our audience?  Bill Burr got ripped apart  in front of our audience.  Right, right.  They like him,  and he's really funny.  Yeah, you know what?  We should allow him to do...  Yeah, you want to do this  in front of our audience?  Yeah, the next virus tour,  you know,  where we sell close to 20,000 tickets.  They're horrible.  We'll give you five minutes  in front of our audience,  and all right,  we'll see how well you do,  you dumb, fat fuck.  That's horrible.  Fucking asshole.  And do they have a broad or not?  It looked like a hole on the page.  Another word of advice,  because we made something 
[02:12:30]  of ourselves in this career,  and you guys are attempting to,  get rid of the hole.  Yeah, ditch the hole immediately.  The hole ruins God's  eye talk radio,  and stop with the shit,  stop listening to your bosses,  and then you'll go somewhere.  Get rid of the hole.  They ruin everything.  Ditch the hole.  You dummies.  You will never need the hole.  Well, Ant, you know what?  Oh, look, they're strangling each other.  Oh, look, that's crazy.  Wow, they're crazy.  That's crazy.  So, Ant, you know, 
[02:13:00]  they might be funnier than us.  You know, I mean,  so, E-Rock,  E-Rock found an example  of them being funny.  Is this some of their show?  Creativity?  Creativity.  That isn't stifled  by satellite radio?  So, to give them  a fair shake here,  we're going to play  one of their bits  to see how funny  these fuckers are.  Takes the creativity  right out of it  when you're on satellite radio.  So, this is not satellite.  Right.  It's them doing  a regular show.  Right.  And they have to be  very creative  and work around.  Okay, I got it.  It's one minute  of funny  from these guys. 
[02:13:30]  I don't even know  their names.  Open mind?  I don't really give a shit.  Open mind?  We've seen a million  of these fucking shows  come and go.  Another reason why  you should use  your regular voice  so you stand out  instead of them going,  oh, well,  we could just replace  that voice with this voice  and no one will know  because it's the same voice.  How do you think  we came up with  the Slappy and Wappy  show name?  Right.  Because they're all  just Slappy and Wappy.  Doesn't matter.  Did you listen  to management  and allow them  to give you a whole  to keep everything safe?  You guys need a girl  in there  because then the women 
[02:14:00]  listen and it keeps  you guys in check.  She's there  to kind of keep you guys  from getting out of control.  Really?  And then you sit there  and you're jealous  of our success.  Look, two lessons.  Get rid of the hole  and just use your regular voice  and I'm telling you  your audience  will grow immediately.  We give you  a little lesson.  And here's this show  being really funny.  Hey, y'all.  You're probably wondering  where I get such glamorous  wigs.  Duh, y'all.  I started my own wig company  called Wigged Out. 
[02:14:30]  Get it?  All my wigs are made  from the highest quality  synthetic yak hair  and polyester blend  to get it that  oh-so-special  Sam Donaldson look.  Even Hollywood celebrities  love them.  Right, mystery celebrity?  That's right, Brittany.  Even though my identity  is a secret.  What?  It is.  Ha, ha, ha.  I am a frequent user  of hair pieces  so as an anonymous expert  I feel compelled  to come forward  and say  I love Wigged Out. 
[02:15:00]  I get it.  It's a funny name.  Go around me.  My line includes  everyday fresh looks  like  three-day strung out  I need rehab look  the hillbilly hoedown look  and my personal favorite  the Whitney Houston  crack den weave.  Those are extensions, y'all.  So order today  from my online store  Wigged Out.  Get it?  That's clever, y'all.  He does these impersonations.  I swear you would think  it was the real people.  Do the best. 
[02:15:30]  When you can't do  John Travolta well  another bit of advice  Yeah, yeah.  Say hi, this is John Travolta  to bring everyone to the table.  So we don't have to listen  three times  to figure out who it is.  Impressionists do.  Yeah.  They're almost there  so they're like  you know, to hammer it home  they're like  you know, whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  But to like make it  a mystery and a secret  who the guy is  and you don't do the voice well  really keeps people confused.  I had no idea 
[02:16:00]  who that was  up until Patrice said something.  I just thought  it was some yelling guy.  I didn't  some guy buying a wig.  Well, Ant,  they're funnier than us.  It's so obvious.  I don't know what to do  with this.  I think we should just go home.  I'm depressed.  I think that should go  where Stephen King said  this show should go, my friend.  Really?  You guys are finished.  You want to file this?  Because that's really  There it goes.  Nice try, boys.  Keep carrying on.  Yikes.  And the hole  was able to do a Britney voice. 
[02:16:30]  I guess that was the hole.  Yeah.  Very nice.  Good.  Thanks for the mention.  Must be fun to be popular  in a 20 mile radius.  That's exciting, isn't it?  Yeah.  You go to the next town  and no one knows  who the fuck you are.  That's got to suck.  Ow.  I remember that.  We remember the days, right, Ant?  Yeah.  We were popular  in a 20 mile radius.  They missed the heyday 
[02:17:00]  of the fucking  the big syndication deals  and all that.  Right.  And now it's just, you know,  they'll just  they'll undercut you,  pay you shit,  make you stay in one market  and just beat you down.  So that's fun.  Best of luck to you.  Also, get rid of the sissy  with the cup of tea  and all that.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not my cup of tea,  Jimmy Norton.  Really?  It's not my cup of tea.  Like, you could say that  sarcastically.  Right.  Because like when I say  things like good gosh  or oh, good gravy.  Right, right.  I don't think anyone thinks  I'm really saying that.  Of course not.  But that guy saying  it's not my cup of tea,  he really meant it.  Yeah. 
[02:17:30]  He meant,  he has tea sometimes,  right?  And some of it's better  than other tea.  You see how they're  competing against us?  They had to do a local thing  because they know people  listening to Opie and Anthony  in Baltimore  instead of that show.  They'd have been hotlined  by the PD  if they didn't end it right there.  And the program director  is like, look,  how you compete against  Opie and Anthony  in satellite radio,  you got to go local.  So they're not talking  about the Baltimore Ravens.  Yeah.  But you are.  You're talking about  the Ravens.  Yep.  All right, Anthony,  that was kind of boring  to be honest with you.  A little bit. 
[02:18:00]  It's always fun, though.  We've seen that game  a million times.  And boy, you know,  we've lost every one  of those battles,  haven't we?  God bless you.  We got a radio stunt  that backfired.  This thing is fucking great.  Not us, thank God.  No.  We've had enough of those.  Oh, his stand-up's  on YouTube?  No way.  Maybe the boys  could give us  a sample of his stand-up.  Does he have,  why does it say  black people,  white people  next to his stand-up thing?  Does he do a  black guys and white guys  do things different bit? 
[02:18:30]  How long is that clip?  Because if he does...  Five minutes.  Fuck.  All right, let's take a look.  I am flabbergasted.  The third one down here,  it says black women,  and that's only two minutes.  Okay.  So if you want to go  with the short bit,  we don't want to spend  too much time on these guys.  We've done this  been a hundred times  with show names  that I don't even remember.  Arabs and Jews?  Which one do you want, Ant?  How about the boys  down the hall  pick a good one?  We'll do the Australian  radio prank.  Yeah, we'll do that first.  We'll go back to this clown.  And we'll find out 
[02:19:00]  some of his stand-up.  Wow.  I remember...  Regular Ron Bennington,  this guy.  Jesus.  I remember when  this story hit,  and I didn't think  much of it,  and I didn't search out  the audio, unfortunately.  Jim Jeffries at Caroline's  this weekend is like,  have you heard  this Australian radio thing?  And I said no,  and he explained it to me.  I'm like, holy shit.  And he goes,  you have to play this  on Monday.  This is the biggest fail  in radio history  you're about to hear.  Because they were trying  to do a fun, silly bit, 
[02:19:30]  and it completely backfired  on these guys horribly.  I guess the bit was  they had concert tickets  for some big star.  So they had daughters  and their mothers  come into the studio.  And they hooked the daughter  up to a lie detector,  which is a fucking great idea, right?  Sure.  And then basically,  the daughter had to answer  eight out of ten questions,  something like that,  truthfully,  and the first person  to do that,  would win the tickets.  Sounds like a pretty good bit,  right?  That's pretty good.  Because you know  they're going to ask  the daughter some crazy shit,  or the mother's going to ask 
[02:20:00]  the daughter crazy shit.  Highly embarrassing.  And now the daughter  has to decide how important  it is to get these tickets,  right?  Mm-hmm.  Listen how this plays out.  The air in here  is thick, Jackie.  I know.  We're all a bit nervous,  actually,  because mom has brought  her daughter in  to go on the lie detector.  We just had a chat  to actually about her  concerns with her  14-year-old daughter.  They added the shit  out of this because...  Aussie hole!  Yeah, because I guess  the prime minister  got involved,  and this is a biggie,  so they're getting rid 
[02:20:30]  of all the names,  so no one gets sued.  ...with her 14-year-old daughter  and why she wanted  to bring her in.  14-year-old daughter,  very key to this.  I mean, yeah.  Let me back up a little bit.  So it's a mom  with her 14-year-old daughter.  ...about her concerns  with her 14-year-old daughter  and why she wanted  to bring her in.  If you missed it,  here's a little quick recap  before we do  the lie detector.  Last Thursday night,  she went to bed  at 9 o'clock.  I gave her a kiss goodnight  and 2.30 in the morning,  I got a knock on the door  from two undercover police  bringing her home. 
[02:21:00]  What's your worst fear?  Is it the sex?  Is it the lying?  Is it possibly doing drugs,  smoking?  What do you think?  Drugs and sex  and older boys.  Yeah.  Definitely older boys.  Has she told you  she's had sex before  or do you think  she's a virgin?  I think she might have  had sex before.  Right, but she hasn't  said anything.  No.  Have you asked about  the drugs and things  like that?  Yes, I know for a fact  that she's been  smoking marijuana.  Right, so she's  admitted that, has she?  So you want to know  if she's doing anything  harder than marijuana then?  Okay.  All right, we have her  hooked up to the lie detector. 
[02:21:30]  She's not happy.  I just saw her  listening to that replay.  So far, you've got to  give these guys credit.  A plus on the bid idea  and the set up, okay?  You've got a 14-year-old  girl with the mom.  This is something  we would have, I mean,  I'm jealous.  I'm like, fuck,  I wish we thought of this,  okay?  Remember, the mom said,  I think she had sex before.  That's key here.  Six.  Huh?  She thinks she had sex  and smoked marijuana.  Right.  So she seems like a wild...  Really chopper. 
[02:22:00]  People from faraway lands  always sound stupid.  She sounds like one of  those crazy sex-crazed  Maury Povich-type  14-year-olds, right?  I'm going to do it.  I won't.  So here we go.  The lie detector test starts.  Listen closely  because the accent  is a little fucked up.  Mom, you have a series  of questions  that you're going  to ask your daughter  and you reply  either yes or no  and then it will be  picked up on the lie detector  whether you are  telling the truth  or lying. 
[02:22:30]  Okay, Mom,  what do you want  to start with?  Okay, about school.  Just recently started  at a new school  and I want to know  have you wagged  at your new school?  I have not wagged  at my new school  so the answer would be  no.  No.  That means fuck.  Oh, okay.  I would assume.  I thought it meant  are you attending class?  Just, what's Australian?  Wag.  It's like shag,  wag, fuck.  Are you making that up?  I'm just assuming.  The mother's ass  have you fucked at school? 
[02:23:00]  Yeah,  because she's a wild kid.  I don't know.  Make sure wag  is the right thing.  All right,  let's look at wag.  You got to.  And what happens  with the word no?  I understand accents  around the world.  No.  How does it become  yeah?  I can't even say it.  A few syllables?  No.  No.  No.  No.  How do you fuck up  that word that badly?  That's cutting school.  Oh, it is cutting school?  There you go.  Because that doesn't  make sense for  have you been fucking  at school?  All right.  Okay, let's do this.  No.  Well, she's starting  with easy questions  which is the way  you go with this bit. 
[02:23:30]  I want to wag the show  at my new school.  So the answer would be  no?  No.  No.  And that's a fail.  I haven't wagged.  Are you kidding me?  I'm just calling  the police.  I haven't bloody wagged.  Poor Charles  is going to cough it  this morning.  You're not within  arms reach there  are you, Charles?  No.  Yeah, you know he is.  He is.  So she answered  the first question  falsely.  Yes.  So she's not going  to get the tickets  unless she starts  telling the truth.  Telling the truth.  Fucking lie detector 
[02:24:00]  tests are just horrid.  Horrid.  It's mumbo jumbo  and voodoo.  Are you fucking  kidding me?  I'm sweating.  Yeah, just being  there it's like  Patrice did you  take a 10 pound  shit the other day?  No?  Yes, I think.  You're lying  you fucking bastard.  I'm not lying  I just don't remember.  I'm not lying.  My brother beat  a lie detector once.  Really?  Beat the fucking thing.  For real? 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  What was that about?  Uh, some pilfering  at work.  Nice.  He was, um  it was alleged  it was alleged  he had pilfered  an elephant tusk.  I swear to you.  For the ivory?  Yeah.  Because he worked  at a place  that made custom  pistol grips.  You know?  Pistol grips.  So he wanted ivory?  Make it out of ivory,  mother of pearls,  staghorn,  um,  all kinds of  semi-precious  substances.  Your brother worked  at the pistol grip factory?  Pistol grip place.  Fucking white trash.  You know,  I know,  it was total white trash. 
[02:25:00]  Crackers.  Total white trash.  But you know what?  You had to be artistic  to do it.  You couldn't just  like print them out.  It wasn't a printing thing.  You're using these pieces  of like this  precious material  and you have to  grind it.  It sounds tremendous  but it's just the fact  that someone is doing it.  The person that would do it,  I want to have it  in my hand  as opposed to  like knowing the person  that works at the  fucking grip factory.  He would make  some of the grips  you know,  for the company  and then on the side  he'd go to the gun stores  and be like,  hey,  you know, 
[02:25:30]  what do you need?  I'll make you  this real cheap  and he was able  to make a pair of grips  in like no time.  Oh yeah,  he plays guitar.  But my uncle,  my uncle  makes guitars  so he makes  exotic guitars too.  He flies in wood  from fucking Africa  and shit  and makes these  unbelievable guitars.  That fucking kills me  how y'all hate black people  but everything precious  other than black people  was from Africa?  Diamonds,  wood,  fucking everything.  Well,  for a while  black people too  were imported  as precious commodities.  But we wasn't precious, 
[02:26:00]  just animals.  But boy,  your shit harvested.  That was some precious.  Maybe our teeth was great.  Those nigger teeth  just make a nigger too.  Oh god damn.  There's some of my,  yeah,  there's one of my uncles  because I punch up  one of those fucking things.  He's like,  he's an artist.  The fucking guy.  And everything  completely by hand.  Yeah.  Like dozen fucking,  nothing is made  with some wacky machine  or anything.  That's sweet.  Yeah,  it's amazing.  Brother Joe's,  oh god.  Oh,  brother Joe's on the line?  Yeah,  tell him how.  Oh shit.  Well,  yeah,  I'll just go through 
[02:26:30]  real quick  and then Joe can  fill in some of the blanks.  But maybe he's calling,  let's make,  maybe he's calling to say,  dude,  don't tell the story.  Pop Joe down.  Joe.  Joe.  Yeah,  I don't care.  I'm just waiting  until Anthony's  starting to ramble.  I got it.  Oh,  okay.  Well,  I'm only up to the part  where you used to take  some pistol grips  and go to the gun store  and then sell them  to people.  Yeah,  those were,  yeah,  those were like,  I'd take scrap  and make like,  what was that,  whatever was left over,  like Derringer grips  or,  you know, 
[02:27:00]  smaller,  smaller guns.  Not just scrap though.  I'd go there,  I'd go there with like  a handful of clay  and tell them like,  you know,  like take the clay  in your hand  and grip it  the way you would,  the way you would,  you know,  your pistol  and I'll make it  custom for your hand.  And I made the things  the same fucking way  every time,  but it kind of,  you know,  made people think  they were custom grips  and I would get  top dollar for them.  You hear Joe's,  but he's,  he's absolutely asleep  first of all.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  I know he called  and say X-May  on the stage. 
[02:27:30]  What about the,  what about the TARS ago?  Well,  I was,  I was working  in the back door.  I left the back door open.  I came back  and I grabbed the TUSC.  It just so happened  that the people  that we were working for,  one of the,  one of the people  were the owner  of the Dale Systems,  which is a huge,  huge security company.  And,  and it turned out  that they sat me down  for a lie detector test.  The,  the owners of the company  put me in a,  in a chair  and they hooked me up 
[02:28:00]  this lie detector machine  and started asking me  all kinds of questions.  They had like a professional  interviewer come in  and,  and all I do is I sat  and I stared at the,  I stared at the doorknob  and I kept telling myself  there's no way  this fucking machine  is going to be able to,  is going to be able  to tell whether  I'm telling the truth  or not.  And it had,  when the,  long story short,  when the interview  was done,  the lady came up  to me and said,  I'm,  I'm,  I'm very sorry  for taking you in here,  Joey.  You've been a good boy.  That's fucking amazing. 
[02:28:30]  And you did,  that's amazing.  But you did take it.  Oh,  absolutely,  yeah.  Oh my God.  Statute of limitations  is up on an elephant.  Wait a minute.  Wait,  wait,  wait,  I want to,  I want to jump in.  That might be some money though.  Let me preface this.  How much was it worth?  I was 20 years old  and starving at the time.  Whatever.  It's a lot.  Many years have gone by.  We've all done stupid shit.  And it's like,  fucking the guy's dead anyway.  Yeah.  Got it on the company.  And the elephant,  apparently.  How much is the Tusk worth  on the black market?  At the time,  at the time,  it was like,  it was a few hundred dollars.  That was it. 
[02:29:00]  We used to get a lot of,  a lot of Tusks  that were pulled out of fires  that the,  this guy had a connection  over in India  that was like stupid.  Oh, Indian elephants.  Yeah.  When,  when the,  when,  when,  when a poacher  is caught with ivory,  illegal ivory,  they,  they,  they take the Tusks  and they burn them.  So it cracks them  and it makes them useless  for any,  you know,  for any,  any type of jewelry  or,  you know,  anything.  So,  these,  this,  it was a cracked Tusk  that basically  you can only make small, 
[02:29:30]  small pieces of,  of,  of pistol grip jewelry with.  Brother Joe,  when you passed  the lighted detective test,  what were you thinking?  Like,  holy shit,  this worked?  Absolutely.  No,  no,  I wasn't because I,  I just kept on telling myself  there's no way  a fucking machine.  He actually convinced himself  he wasn't guilty.  Right.  Don't give it up.  Awesome.  If you don't give it up physically,  if you're respiration,  perspiration,  fucking,  you know,  You can't control your perspiration.  If you don't give it up.  If you're a sociopath,  basically,  you're saying you can pass this.  That's true. 
[02:30:00]  You have to,  If you're a serial killer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's going to work for everybody,  Joe.  You're one of the lucky ones.  You have to put yourself  into the head of a sociopath.  Yeah.  Thank you,  Joe.  I got to get back to this,  this Australian thing  with the light detector test.  I have one more thought about the,  and just real quick,  the,  the authors,  that are being cunts with you guys.  There was a guy named Tucker Max  that was at my show the other night.  I know you guys interviewed him.  And he had the same idea about,  you know,  about the,  about the shock jocks.  And, 
[02:30:30]  and basically I'm thinking  that these motherfuckers  have no quick way  of putting across  their thoughts and ideas.  They have to put pen to paper.  Have to write a book.  And it takes them a long fucking time.  So basically it's jealousy.  That's it.  That's all I wanted to say.  Jealousy that makes them hate you fucking guys.  All right.  Thanks,  Joe.  Thanks,  man.  Tucker Max.  This is a joke.  And if you want to see what we did to him  a couple of years ago,  search it out on YouTube.  He's one of these guys  that wrote a book  about all his,  um,  sex capades,  his sex stories,  like all this crazy shit  happened to him. 
[02:31:00]  And crazy,  crazy.  And we looked him right in the eye  and said,  you're fucking lying.  That didn't happen.  And he actually made the best solo list,  uh,  the New York Ties best solo list.  And we called him out on it.  And he,  and,  and the,  he was so uncomfortable in his skin  because we called him out.  We're like,  that didn't happen.  Ah,  fuck him.  You're just making up stories.  Why don't you at least admit it?  He's an ace.  But look at,  look for the video on YouTube.  We crushed him.  Uh,  so we get back to the Australian radio show.  So we're,  uh,  where were we?  That's about 10 minutes ago.  She didn't wag at school,  which is cutting class or cutting school. 
[02:31:30]  Right.  All right.  And then,  uh,  and the lie detector test continues.  And of course she's got to,  she's got to,  uh,  answer these questions truthfully.  And she gets the tickets for the big show.  Right.  Right.  And this is where it fails miserably.  Now,  so the lie detector is saying you have,  what is,  is there something,  how can,  what's happening here,  Charles?  Or maybe she skipped a class or something like that.  Have you done that?  Have you skipped classes?  No.  No.  I haven't.  Have you left there early?  No,  I haven't.  Could it come up,  could it come up a fail? 
[02:32:00]  Like,  have you,  have you had a sick day or something where you bunged on a bit of a sickie and you thought,  oh,  yeah,  there's plenty of them.  All right.  Well,  is that,  could that be it?  Well,  that's it apparently.  Yeah.  Okay.  What's your next question,  mom?  Okay.  Have you had sex?  I've already told you the story of this.  Don't look at me and smile because it's not funny.  Oh,  okay.  Um,  I got raped when I was 12 years old.  Did you hear that?  Cause the accent's a little fucked up.  Yeah.  Cause she had an extra syllable. 
[02:32:30]  Fire so fired.  Fucking fire.  Go fucking care.  I got raped when I was 12 years old.  Yeah.  The accent's a little fucked up.  She got raped when she was 12.  Exactly is what she said.  I was,  the mom asked if she ever had sex knowing that her daughter was raped at 12 years old.  What's that supposed to be?  Some kind of sick joke?  Does the mother know?  Yeah.  Cause she said,  I told you.  Yeah.  But she might've said,  I told,  I told you.  No,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no.  You'll see.  Let's listen.  Cause in the mom's eyes, 
[02:33:00]  ah,  the rape thing might not be considered sex.  Oh boy.  I've already told you the story of this.  And don't look at me and smile because it's not funny.  Oh,  okay.  Um,  I got raped when I was 12 years old.  Right.  And is that the,  is that the only experience you've had?  I only found out about that,  um,  a couple of months ago.  Yes,  I knew about that.  And yet you still ask me the question.  I was,  the question was,  have you had sex other than that? 
[02:33:30]  I'm really sorry.  We didn't actually know that that was the case.  And I think we might actually bought this,  this segment.  I,  I had no idea that you've been through that.  So I'm really sorry.  And we'll just let you off the hook.  I think,  I think it's best not to continue.  She was very badly raped.  You see?  You can hear how depressed this.  Hector of the modern age.  Oh,  Paul,  girl.  The broadcaster is so depressed because she's like,  oh,  his bitch fucked.  She was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had. 
[02:34:00]  And I've had him all over the world.  He said,  I can smell your cunt.  What would management say?  What we're dealing with here is a complete lack of respect for the law.  Do the best.  Oh,  dear Lord,  Jesus,  this ain't happening.  I am proud to be a lesbian.  Well,  that's great.  That's just fucking great,  man.  Now,  what the fuck are we supposed to do? 
[02:34:30]  What was the boosy bop city bop?  You ever seen a grown man naked?  Is that the biggest fail ever?  Okay.  Like,  um,  like,  um,  Oh my God.  You look like assholes right now,  man.  Be more funny.  I love the smell of maple.  Oh,  it's supposed to be giant cock.  This is going great. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  You ever suck a guy's cock?  I'm not wanting.  I'm not wanting.  This is great iced tea.  You never know.  Act like wherever you are,  that's the place to be.  Is that amazing?  But how hilarious was the girl though?  Yeah.  Her attitude was like,  she,  you can see her looking at her mother like,  yeah.  Remember what I,  okay.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  You want to go there?  But how stupid is the mom?  Like,  besides the rape thing, 
[02:35:30]  I really need to know if you've had sex.  this,  this psychopath would think if you take it in the ass and not the vaginas,  not sex.  So I can imagine that if you,  if it was taken,  she's like,  have you willingly let a mother fucking fuck you?  Right.  Which is a fair.  Maybe the girl is just dumb.  She should have known that.  I was right when I was 12.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Okay.  No,  no,  no,  no, 
[02:36:00]  no,  no.  So is that it?  There's no fallout?  Well,  we got a little more.  And if,  if Danny can find the story,  I forgot,  but I know the prime minister got involved.  Oh,  no.  Yeah.  Well,  we'll,  we'll give you some details on what happened after the last bit of audio here.  But first,  Larry King checking in,  Larry.  Yeah.  So where did he put the groceries?  What did he do with the groceries?  Oh,  you know what?  Very good.  Mark. 
[02:36:30]  We missed something in that audio.  Mark in Connecticut.  How about that broadcaster lady says that it's time to abort the segment?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The segment.  Maybe you shouldn't use the word abort.  Okay.  Okay.  And then,  and then they try to like,  and now it's,  we've been here before.  Now it's,  let's try to save our jobs.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  In two minutes.  It's like a rodeo.  Let's see if we could stay on this fucking,  uh,  God damn. 
[02:37:00]  Listen to them.  Try to save their jobs.  And actually 49 seconds of,  I'm really sorry.  I had no idea that,  that this had happened to you.  I don't think we would have gone ahead with that.  If had we known.  Okay,  honey,  we'll just let you go for a while.  I'm sorry.  I didn't,  I didn't realize that was.  Okay,  mom.  Sorry.  Look,  we needed to,  we,  you know,  that's something we should have probably known before we started this.  Yeah,  definitely.  Um,  so like,  let's do that.  Let's get you,  if you guys haven't had any,  any counseling or any,  any one to talk to about that, 
[02:37:30]  we're happy to,  to,  um,  pick up the bill for that.  We've got them here.  Do you want that mom?  Yes.  That'll be good.  Yeah.  That'll be good.  Okay.  Well,  you know,  and that might,  um,  having difficulty communicating with.  Okay.  Yeah.  Okay.  Thanks for coming in,  doll.  Sorry about that.  Thanks,  honey.  Okay.  We're out to everyone.  Um,  Jackie's got some more news coming up.  No,  you don't need any more news.  Ah,  he's got some news.  He's like,  you want some counseling? 
[02:38:00]  We'll pick up the 10.  Ah,  holy fuck.  I'm all screwed.  I just offering everything.  You want to live.  I can't do the accent.  Fuck.  You want to live in my house.  What do you need?  What do you need?  You want to drive my car?  I'll give you my car.  All expense paid vacation.  Where you want to go?  Disneyland.  Where?  Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Please don't for us.  I need this fucking job.  Aye.  Aye.  Love the nay.  Nay. 
[02:38:30]  That fucking,  that guy was scrambling.  Oh man.  What do you want?  They offered everything in 49 seconds.  What do you need?  Now here's why I'm retarded.  What do you need?  What do you need?  Why,  why are they in trouble?  Yeah,  why is that bad?  Because,  to tell you the truth,  they just,  that popped out.  I think,  I think.  Because radio guys are scum.  Leave it to this though.  We're just scum.  I mean,  let's think about this.  We're supposed to know everything.  We're supposed to have a crystal fucking ball,  Patrice.  That's why.  If it had happened on this show,  there would have been some kind of extremely inappropriate remark or laughter or something 
[02:39:00]  after she said she was right at Twilf.  After we said,  huh?  Yeah,  yeah.  What'd you say?  There would have been jokes now and bad things.  They just clammed up completely.  Yeah.  We're quiet.  And then the hole,  the Aussie hole popped in with some,  you know,  responsible fucking talk.  Oh,  the guy went silent for a minute.  Yeah,  yeah.  They just,  they had some responsibility like Huffman.  I'm nigh.  Um,  Anthony,  um,  there was something in the audio that you might not have heard.  Oh,  yeah?  Yeah.  If I could, 
[02:39:30]  uh,  replay that for everybody.  Apparently they're back on the air now with a delay system.  That's what Dr.  Steve is telling me.  Dr.  Steve knows everything about radio and medicine.  So what happened to them,  Danny,  basically?  What do you know about this?  Uh,  well,  after that show,  they were removed from the air.  Okay.  That was,  uh,  back in August,  the beginning of August.  They did come back,  uh,  after a two week,  a hiatus.  Okay.  Uh,  and now they,  pre-record some portions of their show and they do have a delay in place.  I guess they,  they were running just completely live previously.  God bless Australian radio. 
[02:40:00]  No one hears it,  but God bless it anyway.  Who the hell hears it?  Because if that happens to anybody here in America,  fuck,  I mean,  everyone is fired.  The dingo raped your baby.  That's like a format change if it happens here.  Oh,  hell yeah.  All right.  So,  and then what did the prime minister say?  Who raped her?  Lord of the wasteland,  humongous.  Let's talk to this humongous.  He seems like a reasonable man.  Just walk away from the show. 
[02:40:30]  Leave the oil and just walk away.  That's why I got to start watching more movies.  Road warrior.  How do you fucking access quotes from that fucking shitty movie,  man?  That's fucked up,  isn't it?  Two days ago,  I saw a guy that had raped that 12 year old.  Only Australian one you ever see the movie with a,  which one was it?  Uh,  shit.  Uh,  Oh,  layer cake.  When the guy,  Oh yeah.  The guy raves boys and he goes,  that's a good movie.  Fuck.  He goes,  fucking girls is for poof.  Poofters.  Poofters. 
[02:41:00]  For poofters.  Dog shit sniffer.  I can't do the accent.  Fuck.  Woodside.  He writes,  sorry about that.  Uh,  I'm not even gonna try.  Sorry about that.  Do we have something in the prize closet for you?  What do we got?  Maybe a SNL box set.  Aye.  Aye.  The best of Alec Baldwin.  Best of Alec Baldwin.  Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  We got to get something good, Anthony, but it's bloody horrible.  Listen closely.  There's something else in this, uh, audio you might've missed. 
[02:41:30]  Let me hear.  Well, is that, could that be it?  Well, that's it apparently.  Yeah.  Okay.  What's your next question, mom?  Okay.  Have you had sex?  I've already told you the story of this.  Don't look at me and smile because it's not funny.  Oh, okay.  Um, I got raped when I was 12 years old.  Goodness gracious.  Right.  And is that the, uh, is that the only experience you've had?  I only found out about that, um, a couple of months ago. 
[02:42:00]  Yes, I knew about that.  And yet you still ask me the question.  I was, the question was, have you had sex other than that?  I'm really sorry.  We didn't actually know that that was the case and I think we might actually bought this,  this segment.  I, I had no idea that you'd been through that, so I'm really sorry.  And we'll just let you off the hook, I think.  I think it's best not to continue.  Down goes Fraser!  Down goes Fraser!  Down goes Fraser!  Jesus Christ.  So what if the mother had just went, other, okay. 
[02:42:30]  The mother is the stupid one in there.  If she had said...  What the fuck are you asking a sex question to a 14-year-old that was raped when she was  12?  Yeah.  Other than...  How bad do you need to see the stupid, uh, show?  If she, when she got in trouble, if she had said, other than the rape, have you had sex?  Right.  Other than the rape.  Oh, shit.  Like, if she had said that herself.  Aye, nigh.  Oh, wow.  The, uh, radio guy, he survived that one, but he...  What?  But then he got fired for something else.  What do we got, Danny?  We're learning more about this radio show.  The Canadian radio host was yanked off, or yanked off, the air, uh, Wednesday, for joking 
[02:43:00]  about weight loss at concentration camps, less than a month after serving a suspension  for quizzing a teenage rape victim.  Sydney's Today FM said shock jock Kyle Sandlin's, uh, remarks, uh, that the best way for comedy  actress, uh, Magda Zegabagaday to lose weight was to go to a concentration camp were unacceptable.  Um, let's see, ba-ba-ba-ba, we know that.  You put a concentration camp, uh, ba-ba-ba-ba, what happened to him? 
[02:43:30]  Go down a little further.  He apologized, of course.  Tiz Jockey was sacked from his role as a judge on the television talent show Australian  Idol over that incident.  Today FM decided to not say when or if he will return to the airwaves.  Oh, yeah, he did the American Idol of Australia.  Of Australia, and then he was kicked off of it.  I called the American Idol of Australia.  Yeah, and then he was kicked off of it after the lie detector thing.  Yep.  And now he did a concentration camp.  Aye, nice.  Oh, yeah.  That's like Ryan Seacrest doing, like, concentration camp jokes.  Concentration camp jokes.  Why would you do that? 
[02:44:00]  Anthony, can you do...  I wish I could do it.  I would do it if I could.  Can you do the Australian guy who says a concentration camp joke and then mentally catches himself  going, I'm doing a...  Oh, fuck.  I'm doing a concentration camp joke.  I'm going to get fired.  Aye, she's a little overweight, aye?  You know what she should do, probably, and end up going to one of those concentration camps.  I'll lose a little weight there.  No?  I...  Oh, good. 
[02:44:30]  Not that I'm saying that any of the Jews ever needed to be in a concentration camp, or that  they deserved it, or anyone would deserve something as horrible as that, because that's terrible.  It never...  You should probably go on a diet.  I never said it.  It never happened.  Erase the tape.  Please, I need this joke.  It never works when you're trying to explain yourself.  It never works out.  Let's say hi to Jason in Detroit.  Don't fool you me, nigh.  Nigh, nigh, nigh.  Jason has a very good question, Anthony. 
[02:45:00]  Jason?  Morning, fellas.  Good morning.  She was there to win tickets.  Did she ever win them?  Or did it get a sound play?  Sounds like a Larry King question.  Right.  What happened to the tickets?  Were there two empty seats at the show that night?  VIPs.  Fucking brought her on stage.  Everybody, this is the little 12-year-old rake girl.  Yeah, let's bring her up.  That's it.  You're never alone.  We're not going to cover a Nirvana song for her.  Jesus.  What?  I didn't say anything. 
[02:45:30]  Ding, da, da, ding, ding.  What?  Smells like teen spirit?  Exactly.  Probably did.  What you swabbed for DNA?  DNA.  Holy shit, man.  Oh, what now, Danny?  It just makes me so upset when I see, you know, stories like this that are just misreported.  Well, then say, oh, no.  Oh, no.  It's not like Sal.  Oh, no, Ro.  It just says here, last month, Sandalands lost his judgeship on Australian Idol after 
[02:46:00]  getting a 14-year-old girl to admit on his show that she'd been raped when she was 12.  Now, that's not the audio I just heard.  No, that isn't getting her to admit.  See, that would, that to me, if I just read that and didn't hear the audio, I would think  that he was just grilling her about something and she was like, yeah, I was raped.  The mother fucked that up.  That was the mother putting the goddamn jocks in a bad position.  Oh, it sounds like he was going, oh, come on, you've been raped.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on. 
[02:46:30]  Fess up.  Fess up.  That's why we have you.  You've been raped.  Come on.  You look all raped up.  Come on.  Be honest.  The press actually being accurate.  Let me see your hymen.  I bet you don't have a hymen.  Let me see it.  A hymen.  Is your hymen intact?  I believe your hymen ain't even intact.  Let me see it.  Ay, nay.  It's busted.  It's busted.  Your fucking hymen's busted.  Ay, nay. 
[02:47:00]  Remember, we're not funny because, you know, we have to be more clever.  You fucking hymen.  What's your fucking hymen?  Ay, the hymen.  You ever have your little titty squeezed, eh?  Ay, nay.  I didn't mean that.  I didn't mean it.  You did the Australian.  Let's go to the news.  The Australian version of hymen.  Let's go to the news.  Of course, I think I'm in trouble.  I shouldn't talk about hymen.  Let me, uh...  This thing is busted.  It's busted.  Wide open.  Fucking...  Crikey.  Crikey. 
[02:47:30]  Crikey.  It's probably a giant penis.  Crikey.  Cracked open your hymen.  Are you taking a piss, you little whore?  Crikey.  Right, Dave.  This is bollocks.  Damn it.  Right.  I'll bet you wagged school that day.  And from...  And, uh, Pat from Monocchi...  Oh, fuck.  Just writes, sex for fosters.  Yes.  Sex for fosters, eh?  All right?  You gotta go to that big Sydney amphitheater and have sex over there for a fosters. 
[02:48:00]  Don't go to the church, eh?  People want to know where Good Evening and Try the Wine come from.  Oh, my God.  Watch Clockwork Orange immediately and you'll get half this show.  So, let's say hi to Larry King, Anthony.  This is a pleasure.  Larry.  Larry King.  Hello?  Tell us about the rape kit.  Jesus, Larry.  That's horrible.  That's quite inappropriate.  Come on, Larry.  Let's go to Larry King on line five, Anthony.  How he gets between these phones. 
[02:48:30]  Larry.  Yeah.  Was that a guru or Joey?  Who raped you?  He's making kangaroo jokes.  Because there's only one animal in Australia, and that is the kangaroo.  We all know that.  Oh, this is, you know, a little observation from Snake in New Orleans.  Snake?  Yeah, boys.  I'm wondering what kind of sick woman this mom is for smiling at the kid while she was asking the question.  Yeah.  She goes, don't smile. 
[02:49:00]  You know.  Right.  Oh, that was the kid that said that, or was that the mother who said don't smile?  That was the kid that said to the mother, like, don't smile.  You know what the fuck the answer is.  Right.  What the fuck?  And then she just went, all right, fuck it.  Here it comes.  I like how she just said that.  So the kid is dumb then.  No, the kid looked at the mother, and the mother started smiling like, oh, oh, well, you had sex, but not that rape thing.  They're both dumb.  They're both fucking dumb.  Well, the kid's 14 and raped.  I mean, you can't really blame her for anything.  Well, look, that's not the, she's fucking, I mean, that doesn't have anything, you don't 
[02:49:30]  get your context raped out of you, like, to understand how to get it.  Yeah.  She didn't want to fucking admit that she was raped on her head, but both of them are dumb.  Holy shit.  They're fucking stupid.  You ever take it in the bum?  Did he give it to you in the bum?  Aye.  Ah.  Oh, we got an Australian Larry King.  I bet she was blowing bush oyster all over the place.  Yeah.  And see, this might be the bit today, because the Larry King thing. 
[02:50:00]  What a come to gusto that was.  Oh, my God.  The Larry King might not be working, but we got the Australian Larry King on the phone.  The guy thought it was a corker, though.  Fucking Hyman.  Corker.  Fucking corker.  Get your cunt.  Australian Larry King, check it out.  Yes.  How important is foreplay?  When you're getting right, that is.  Oh, fuck you. 
[02:50:30]  In the vag.  In the vag.  In the vag.  In the vag.  But you've got to say it long.  In the vagina.  Vagina.  Almost sounds like rejoiner.  Vagina.  That's where the Hyman is.  The Hyman.  If you want a chick for a busted Ormond, you look in the vagina.  Oh, that's fucking awful.  My God.  Damn.  We didn't fucking do it.  Well, we didn't fucking do it.  Yeah, fuck them.  Of course. 
[02:51:00]  Stupid dick.  It would be great to be fired for a second-hand radio bit.  Ain't that a bitch for commenting on that?  For commenting on a radio bit.  Oh, Jesus.  Ah.  Yeah.  God damn.  That is a stunt that went horribly wrong.  And Australian humor, you know, coming in now.  I don't even know what this means.  We might have to look it up ourselves.  Rob on Long Island.  Rob.  Rob.  Yeah.  In the Aussie sperm.  I'm the only one with a man out back and I have to take a piss.  I have to stop for a minute and think, am I a bloke or a Sheila? 
[02:51:30]  I don't know.  Sheila.  Sheila.  The way they say it, you can't even, like, say it.  Let's see how the letter came in.  Oh, my missus.  Binged her right in the freckle.  Yeah.  I don't use no franga, neither.  Or just binged her in a freckle.  Let's see.  Gave me a load of ear bashing, too.  I wouldn't stop a fucking ear bashing while I busted up a freckle. 
[02:52:00]  Didn't use no franga, neither.  It's a freckle.  I've never heard a call back in freckle.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Love the smell of a good Aussie freckle.  Smells like a vagina.  Australian ant.  Stephen S. from Bayshore, if you can read that.  Oh, shit.  I don't have that there.  Can you see that right there?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Did his penis taste like Vegemite? 
[02:52:30]  Like a Vegemite.  See, a little.  I hear it's quite bitter.  Australian Larry King checking in.  Yes, Larry.  Larry.  Sidney, you're on the air.  How important is the consent during sex?  Vegemite.  Aussie Larry King's not as funny.  Yeah, what happened?  Because we don't want to ruin our Larry King bit yet.  This isn't a subject that Larry can really comment on.  Australian Larry King checking in, Ant.  I'm not giving up on this. 
[02:53:00]  You really want to give him a try?  This fucking bit has potential.  Australian Larry King, yes.  Crikey.  When he gave it to you in the dunny, did you give him a reach around and tickle his bollocks, eh?  In the dunny.  In the dunny.  Yeah.  Our poor dunny was all busted up.  I know.  Let's go to the American Larry King.  Larry.  More importantly, did you have to blow the roadie to get backstage?  Jesus.  She was caught upset afterwards, or heard she had a liquid laugh, or laugh. 
[02:53:30]  How would they say that?  I don't know.  Liquid laugh is puking, which is kind of funny.  That is good.  They got some good fucking...  Uh-oh.  A lurk.  What?  Illegal.  Or underhanded racket.  He did a lurk to a freckle.  And then he pounded her vagina.  Busted her hoiman.  I don't even know what this means. 
[02:54:00]  Larry King checking in on line four, Ant.  Larry.  Yeah.  Does being great give you a platypus?  What is that?  I don't know.  A platypus.  Did he say a platypus?  He sure did.  Jesus.  All right.  With that, why don't we go to break?  I can just imagine him pulling off a grundy's.  He's pulled off a grundy's.  And then he made sure he'd crack a fat.  It looked like a mystery bag, eh?  He popped it right in a freckle. 
[02:54:30]  What?  Aye, nay.  Pat Romunaki.  She gave him a rusty diggeridoo.  Diggeridoo.  A diggeridoo.  You gave her the old rusty diggeridoo, did you?  Aye.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  When you blew on a freckle, did it go?  Sounds like a fuss, this commercial, eh? 
[02:55:00]  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  She was all in the nutty, too.  Totally in the nutty.  It's as dry as a nun's nasty nest.  Dry as a nun's nasty as dry.  Ah, look.  Let me blow into a freckle.  Here we go.  Aye, nay. 
[02:55:30]  Blowing into a vagina.  The sound's made by the hymen.  You can hear the hymen.  It's vibrating because it's not busted yet.  Uh-oh.  There might be a leak right there.  It's a little leaky.  Resonates.  Was she made by Aborigine?  Aye, nay.  Aye.  I don't like that.  That there's race mixing.  But I didn't mean anything bad about it. 
[02:56:00]  If you want to be a race mixer, feel free.  What's race mixing?  I don't want to lose my job.  Aye, yeah.  Aye, nay.  I got a meeting with the GM.  Aye, nay.  Anthony, Larry King checking in.  Oh, Larry King?  Uh, Larry.  Hello, gentlemen.  Hi, Larry.  Larry King.  The Australian Larry Kings are embarrassing.  Yes.  Did the rape scene look like Welsh's grape juice?  Oh, my God.  Larry. 
[02:56:30]  Larry.  Should we take a break?  Uh, yeah.  I would care that we would.  I have to piss so bad, my temperature just dropped.  You ever have that?  I'm getting cold.  I'm getting cold.  She certainly was the Rigi Digi, though.  Yeah.  I don't think she's a porky.  I never put the old fella in a freckle.  The old fella.  I don't care what posse we were in. 
[02:57:00]  I couldn't get to a freckle with me, me banger.  They must have, I think they have the best fucking slang in history.  They got some great fucking slang.  And I thought George Carlin had a few that were pretty good.  Holy shit.  These guys know what they're doing.  And, you know that show that was trashing us in Baltimore, and the one guy said he's  a really funny stand-up, but he's funnier than us.  Funnier than Jimmy, too.  And funnier than Jimmy, he possibly thinks.  Yeah, that's funny, because Jimmy's going to be on Jay Leno tomorrow night with Michael 
[02:57:30]  Moore and Tom Cruise.  Oh.  And where's this guy?  Oh, that's right.  I don't know.  He's going to be, you know, in front of a brick wall somewhere in Baltimore.  Yeah, you're just like Jim Norton.  I hope he eats it right in his freckle.  Yeah, we got a sample of his comedy that we're going to do after the break for everybody.  We'll give him a chance to see if he's telling the truth or not, or if he's lying.  Lying.  Patrice?  What?  Punchline?  Yes.  Patrice O'Neill's a rip-snorter. 
[02:58:00]  Fucking fantastic.  You're a rip-snorter.  And also a root rat.  You're a root rat.  Root rat.  You are a root rat.  Someone constantly looking for sex.  I know.  Who is it?  I know.  Who isn't a root rat?  Who isn't a root rat?  Who isn't a root rat, really?  I think Australia wins in the greatest fucking slang in history.  Wait, but root rat could mean you're going for the...  The freckle?  For the root. 
[02:58:30]  Oh.  Oh.  So maybe you're not a root rat.  Maybe it's a chick.  Right.  I think that's a chick that's looking for a lot of action.  Root rat.  Hey, so it's the Punchline in San Francisco.  Patrice O'Neill, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday of this week.  How do they get tickets, Patrice?  Go to Big Mama Prods for details?  Probably not.  San Francisco, punchlinecomedyclub.com.  Yeah, go see Patrice.  SF.punchlinecomedyclub.com.  I've been to the Punchline a couple times.  What a fucking great club for you guys to perform at.  I like San Francisco.  Except for the weird, like, do they still have the city skyline behind you? 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, that dumb thing.  But, you know, they all do.  Bananas has bananas.  Ugh.  You know, what the fuck?  Just fucking put a wall there.  Let the comic do this stuff.  Chuckles has somebody chuckling.  Why would you...  Someone chuckling.  Or a big smiley mouth.  That's all a distraction.  Yeah, it really is.  They don't understand.  They don't understand that shit?  I like when the people improv with the background.  But it's a great club, though.  Great club.  It really is.  San Francisco.  It really is.  It's it.  All right, why don't we take a break?  We'll continue with Patrice O'Neal.  We still have so much fucking stuff to do.  I know. 
[02:59:30]  You know the Serena Williams thing?  What a guy I'm.  Oh, when she's...  I got a guy I'm.  I know that very well.  All right, we'll talk about that next.  How close was it?  It was a mega shock.  It didn't matter.  It was a mega shock.  Get out of here.  I'm finished.  Patrice O'Neal has me laughing my ass off.  It'll be an Anthony show.  Hi.  Oh, we all know it's Monday, but you'll muddle through. 
[03:00:00]  Muddle.  Yeah, we were just talking about horrible movies that come on the sci-fi channel.  The sci-fi original movies are so utterly bad.  The special effects are terrible.  Is Debbie Gibson in that?  Is that Debbie Gibson?  Lorenzo Llamas and there's Mega Shark.  Mega Shark versus what?  The name of the movie is called Giant Octopus versus Mega Shark.  They couldn't even give Giant Octopus a cool name.  They just call it Giant Octopus versus Mega Shark.  Versus at least Mega Shark is kind of cool. 
[03:00:30]  And you know what?  Here's the great thing about sci-fi.  They have an all-day theme.  It'll be 20 movies, but it'll all be this spring break shark frenzy.  Wait, you guys missed this.  You gotta see what happens to the Golden Gate Bridge.  Mega Shark jumps out of the water and bites it in half.  Mega Shark is biting the Golden Gate Bridge.  Mega Shark is giant.  Because I ask, because Patrice said Mega Shark jumps out of the water and eats a passenger jet. 
[03:01:00]  And I'm like, how could a shark fucking get that high up?  Mega Shark, man.  And the dude looked out the window and said, oh, shh.  And the shush was, you know, the it was cut off.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, there it is.  How did Mega Shark get it?  Mega Shark is the shit.  Well, what about Giant Octopus?  Don't fuck around with Giant Octopus either.  Debra Gibson.  Yes, Debbie Gibson's in that.  Oh, just bit a fucking destroyer.  Octopus wins every time there.  I don't know.  Mega Shark.  The fucking shark has no arms.  They showed a guy looking out the plane window and Mega Shark just hit the plane. 
[03:01:30]  Every Saturday, if I'm not fucking working, I gotta see this movie now.  I'm watching SyFy's original programming.  You know what fucks me up about SyFy's programming, their original programming, too?  They depend so much on CGI, but they have the worst people doing it.  It's the worst.  It is amongst the worst.  I've seen indie films that have no budget, that must have had some talented computer guys  that were able to do some pretty decent CGI.  This is so fucking bad. 
[03:02:00]  You can't even get into it.  Like, first of all, a flying jet airliner nowadays, I could do it.  I could do it on my Mac and make it look like a fucking jet airliner.  That looked so bad.  What's wrong with these fucking...  I'm laughing because I'm thinking...  Because I'm so into these, but I hate them with all my heart.  They do rip-offs.  Their version of the...  And it'll be like the Terminatrix. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, no.  And it'll be a fucking...  Or, you know, or Star, kind of Trekkie.  And it'll be Lorenzo Llamas, fucking Bruce Boxleitner.  They had one called, recently, it was a new one that just premiered.  The premiere of...  Oh, world premiere.  It was a Western town in the old days, in the 1800s, that was attacked by New Age aliens. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, that's kind of cool.  So they had to fight them with...  But it was sci-fi network.  So it's not cool.  Yeah.  And they had to fight these things with their fucking, you know, their six shooters and  their fucking, you know, homemade bombs and shit.  It just...  You know who else is in a lot of those?  What's his name?  Lou Phillips?  Diamond?  Lou Diamond Phillips.  Lou Diamond Phillips.  When?  But he's in a good show called The Cleaner now.  No, it's actually Lou Full of Diamonds because...  No, that's Benjamin Brant.  That's Benjamin Brant.  Holy shit.  That's Benjamin Brant.  My fault.  My fault.  Yeah.  Reading from GenericShow.com writes, Opie, the company that makes this also makes the 
[03:03:30]  movies that rip off blockbuster movies, like Patrice was saying.  The company made Transmorphers.  Transmorphers?  I'm telling you what I rip off.  If you...  And they do part twos of movies that were good.  Oh, right.  And to completely fuck them up.  And they just turn them into...  And they had another one who...  You know who was in it?  What's the guy?  He used to be...  Ken?  Oh, man.  Big guy.  Kind of big. 
[03:04:00]  He used to be an action guy.  Pretty known back in the day.  But he was in...  It was a movie called Cobra.  Giant Cobra versus...  Versus.  They like the versus?  What's the...  The dragon.  Giant Cobra versus Komodo dragon.  Versus.  It's got to be a versus.  It was versus.  That's like Ali Frazier, man.  Ali versus Frazier.  Footer has one, too, that he saw.  Footer.  Lizard being...  Hey. 
[03:04:30]  Hey, there was one that I was flipping through and I saw her.  And it was just...  It was a rock monster or something.  And I don't know how you'd make a rock monster cool anyway.  But all this was, was like the sight of them mounted, would come alive.  And just fucking start eating people.  And they don't even try with the names.  Because it's like...  Yeah.  It's called a rock monster.  It is what it fucking is.  The rock monster.  I got to ask, though.  What's the excuse that people use that they need to get close to rock monsters?  Rock monster?  Because all you would have to do is stay away from the fucking mountain. 
[03:05:00]  Stay around from the mountain.  And you would never get eaten.  No.  You know better than anybody, being a hiker, that, you know, you have to hike and you're  near the mountains.  Right.  And next thing you know, the sight of the mountain, it's a man.  Oh, shit.  That guy.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  Hold on.  Giant Cobra.  I'm looking at Giant Cobra.  And that was the guy that was in Eddie and the Cruisers.  Michael Parry.  Michael Parry.  Yep.  Yeah, yeah.  He was in Eddie and the Cruisers.  And now he's doing one of these.  But if you're into movies, right? 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  If you're into movies, is it the fucking, the fact that everybody's a bad actor, is it  because it's a bad movie?  Yeah.  Or would these people be good in The Godfather if they were in it?  Well, they probably would be good in a real role.  Maybe in a real role.  Some of them, anyway.  Some of them.  Yeah.  Because I'm looking at some of these actors.  Every single person on the screen, I go, I've seen them.  I've seen them in some.  I could not fucking tell you what, except for Michael Parry there.  Why would you ever look for any of these movies on DVD?  It just said, look for it on DVD.  It was one, you know who was in it? 
[03:06:00]  Michael Gross, recently.  A hundred million years BC, where they sent a team back.  And someone fucked something up and fucked the future up.  To find Philadelphia, to find the people that did the Philadelphia Experiment.  Yeah.  They sent them back in time to find them.  So they found them.  And Michael Gross, what happened is he had to be the only one who sacrificed himself.  Yeah.  A giant Tyrannosaurus Rex.  Yep.  Went through the machine with everybody else. 
[03:06:30]  And you know who the star of the fucking movie was?  And he walked around with a bow and arrow the whole show.  Was the kid that was in Blue Lagoon with Brooke Shields.  Oh, really?  Oh, fucking.  It's not Willie Ames.  No, Willie Ames.  Yeah.  Christopher Akin.  Christopher Akin.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was so bad.  But I watched.  I've seen the movie twice.  I can't stop watching the bad sci-fi movies all day.  That's hysterical.  You're just sitting there watching that shit.  The marathons all day.  I get mad because I don't like the wizard movies.  But I do like when it's a fucking... 
[03:07:00]  Is the dialogue good?  It's the worst because it's all, like you said, it's all CGI.  Yeah.  And they'll have a, you know, it'll be a frog.  It's always an experiment.  You think...  Yeah, experiment gone awry.  You think some of these big stars, they get cast for these movies, like, oh, fuck, the  concept's great.  It's fucking short.  And then they realize what it is.  And they do all their acting because they can't see the special effects.  And then they finally see it for the first time and go, holy shit, I'm in a piece of  shit movie. 
[03:07:30]  It's like, yeah, we're going to green screen you in over here.  Just look up here.  And they're probably picturing these effects are going to look like fucking amazing.  They're all thinking Jurassic Park.  Like, fuck, I'm going to the next Jurassic Park movie.  Like, they don't know that the movie...  That's what I'm saying.  Do they know if the movie is going to be shitty or not?  It's going right to sci-fi?  Do you think they know that?  That is a great question, man.  I bet you they're thinking state-of-the-art, special effects, this is it.  If I get a fucking script, though, next thing you know, they show a big giant shark  biting the golden golden person in half.  And you're like, oh, fuck, career suicide. 
[03:08:00]  If I get a script, right?  Career suicide.  If I get a script and the script says giant octopus versus mega shark, I gotta know it stinks.  I would say this better be the working title.  Motherfucker.  Think of some of the other crazy movies out there that ended up becoming huge blockbusters.  No good movies have fucked up titles.  Yeah, I guess.  Godzilla versus the sea monster.  What about Jurassic Park?  That's a fucking shitty movie.  What about Jurassic Park?  That's a great fucking name.  That's a great name before you know that the movie was going to become a huge shit?  Hindsight 2020? 
[03:08:30]  No.  Jurassic Park is a great name.  Jurassic Park is good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because the sci-fi movies would name it Dinosaur Forest.  All right.  You know what?  End the fucking argument.  One for Patrice.  How do I come back from that?  You ain't watching Dinosaur Forest.  It's stupid.  Holy shit.  All right.  Let's go with a few more then, Patrice.  Fuck, I've got to think of a couple movies now. 
[03:09:00]  Damn, that's a good one.  Because I've watched these movies, they're always named stupid, man.  Sci-fi, yeah.  Think of it like a Jurassic Park movie.  Wait, wait, wait.  They're bottom line people, man.  Bottom line.  Why can't we think of any other ones?  Sci-fi.  I was just going to go with basic shit like Godzilla, King Kong.  Well, those are shit movies anyway.  You've got to think of some good sci-fis.  Danny?  Danny does some good sci-fis.  Yeah, you must know some sci-fi.  No, a movie that became huge, but if you looked at the title, and then Patrice will explain  why the title was always great, and how it would be- 
[03:09:30]  Jaws.  How about, like, Star Trek?  Yeah, yeah.  Star Trek.  He's got jaws.  Teeth.  Teeth.  Just teeth.  What would-  All right.  Wait, wait.  Let me tell you something.  There's a movie that they have about evil, evil attacking fucking birds.  You know what it's called?  Call.  Call.  Call.  All right, what would sci-fi call Close Encounters of the Third Kind?  Oh.  All right, thank you, Josh.  Go ahead, go ahead. 
[03:10:00]  They call it Alien Mountain.  That's a good name.  Alien Mountain.  Aliens are visiting us.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to put you to the test.  Or they would name it the sound of the doo-doo.  It would be called doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.  Sci-fi network stinks.  Five alien notes.  Yes!  Alien notes! 
[03:10:30]  Close Encounters of the Third Kind is a great-  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  This guru's fucking great.  We got Matt in West Virginia.  Patrice Iron Man.  Steel Dude.  Fuck, that's what Matt had, too.  Steel Guy.  Steel Guy!  Matt had Steel Guy.  Very good.  They suck!  Did we do Star Wars yet?  Oh, no.  Star Wars.  Galactic fighting. 
[03:11:00]  How about the Terminator?  Now, they had a term, and they called it robot hunter.  I was going to say robot killer from the future.  I'm telling you, yes.  Robot killer, and then in parentheses, from the future.  From the future.  How about this one?  A newer movie.  Thank you, Steve Nolan, Madison, Wisconsin.  Cloverfield.  That's a good one.  They might call it Cloverfield. 
[03:11:30]  Cloverfield might be a sci-fi channel named.  That was it.  New York Monster.  Yeah!  It's not far off!  Oh, is that fucking good?  New York Monster.  Close Encounters, Rex writes, Mashed Potato Mountain.  I'm trying to think of other ones.  Someone's got Mars Attacked. 
[03:12:00]  Mars Attacks.  Right, Nick?  Mars Attacks?  Mars Attacks.  Planet of the Apes is pretty much Planet of the Apes.  Yes.  It's like Planet of Apes.  They'd probably take that out of it.  Planet of Apes.  No, they would call it Simeon Wars.  This is sci-fi.  We'll call it Planet of the Apes.  Simeons versus humans.  Mars Attacks would be Red Chaos from Beyond.  It's awful.  They have to use the word Beyond a lot, too. 
[03:12:30]  This is a tough one.  12 Monkeys.  12 fucking Monkeys.  12 Monkeys was a good movie.  Eek, eek.  I'm telling you, and that's no bullshit.  I'm going to get a job naming these fucking movies.  Oh, shit.  Did we do Aliens?  Eek, eek.  Did we do Aliens?  No, Alien or Aliens.  None of the Alien movies.  A lot of Alien movies out there, Patrice.  What do you think?  Oh.  Sci-fi.  What would they name that?  Man. 
[03:13:00]  An Aliens concept.  That's a tough one.  That's too basic to begin with.  That is rough.  See, what they would do with Aliens is, some of these movies, they don't name, okay, the  concept.  They'll name the place where the concept is happening.  So, if it's an alien type movie and it's happening, say, on a boat, they call it Alien  Boat.  And am I bullshitting, though?  Am I bullshitting?  They'll call it Alien Boat.  Alien Boat.  It's a great bit.  How about The Matrix? 
[03:13:30]  Oh, yeah.  That's a good one.  The Matrix.  Cyber Runners.  Cyber would be in it.  Cyber has to be in it.  Cyber would definitely be in it.  You know what?  Ready?  And it'll be nice and...  Cyber Chaos.  Cyber Chaos.  Someone just wrote, help, I'm trapped in the computer. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, shit.  I'm sorry I missed your name.  That was fucking funny, man.  It was funny.  Help.  I'm trapped in the computer.  And the follow-up called, your bullets are slow.  How about...  This already sounds kind of sci-fi-y.  Back to the Future.  Oh, Back to the Future.  Oh, that's got to be an easy one.  Back to the Future.  Because they would have probably stole it.  If they stole that... 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  Time Car.  Yes, of course.  Time Car.  I like Time Car.  Time Car.  Yeah.  Future change.  Future change.  I'm telling you, man.  Future change.  Fucking Patrice.  Right on.  Right the fuck on.  Premiering at Saturday at 9 o'clock.  Future change.  And you can totally picture it.  Totally fucking picture it. 
[03:15:00]  Night of the Living Dead.  Boomer from Jersey.  12 Monkeys equals.  Holy shit.  We got Brad Pitt to be in one of our stupid-ass movies.  That was a good movie.  Predator.  Very good, Arch, from Long Island.  Predator.  That has to be Space Hunter.  Something with a hunter.  Space Hunter.  Definitely.  They would just call...  It would just be...  It'll be Jungle...  Yeah.  It'll be Space Jungle Hunter. 
[03:15:30]  Space Jungle Hunter.  No bullshit.  Yeah, yeah.  You guys nailed it.  Good movies have good titles, man.  They just do.  Stephen S. from Bay Shore.  They can't even get a good title.  Back to the Future equals Ahead from the Past.  Well, Back to the Future equals Heads Up.  That's the name of the movie.  Heads Up.  I know what's going to happen.  Starring Michael J. Fox.  Bravo.  If we get a few more, we'll go back to this. 
[03:16:00]  So this show, out of nowhere, in Baltimore, decided to trash us today.  We don't know you.  I don't know why you're going down this road.  I guess what happened, what, a producer or something admitted he listens to us...  Listened to the show on the way in.  On the way in to do their radio show, because we got that nice replay on the satellite.  Yes, we do.  So he's taking a peek and listening, and he admitted, wow, this guy was stupid.  He admitted he actually liked another radio show.  Ah, you don't do that in radio.  So then one of the hosts said that he's funnier than us.  Funnier than Jimmy.  Funny than Jimmy. 
[03:16:30]  And if, I don't know, if he went in front of our crowd, he would get a much better reaction than we would.  Well, he'd get a reaction.  That's all right.  So we're like, all right, all right.  We'll take a listen to some of your stand-up and see if you're fucking funny.  Patrice O'Neal's in here.  He knows a thing or two about stand-up.  I'm Patrice.  And I have nothing against these guys, so I'll be very fair.  I want you to have an open mind.  Yes, I will.  Mr. Pupkin, we're going to listen to it, and we'll pass it on to Jerry.  Yeah.  That's what this is.  I'll wait. 
[03:17:00]  And a couple things, you know, they're, I don't know.  Now you heard us earlier.  In sci-fi's crazy comic.  You heard us earlier, but basically the guy has the typical radio voice like everyone else.  I want to give the guy advice.  Start using your own voice.  You'll go further.  And get rid of the fucking hole.  Because, you know, females ruin this type of environment.  Simple as that.  Yes.  Name one where it's worked.  Howard.  Oh, Howard.  Fuck.  I mean, yeah.  To say it hasn't worked, but. 
[03:17:30]  That's about the only case.  I think he's the exception, though.  Yeah.  Has there, for real.  Who else?  All right.  You got Howard, who has Robin.  Who else has been successful in Morning Drive?  Batman.  Doing.  Batman.  Fuck.  That's Robin.  That works.  Doing, you know, guy.  Boo.  Guy talk radio.  Yeah.  Guy talk radio with a hole.  That's been successful.  Sorry.  I can't name another one after Howard.  Sorry.  We chose not to go down that road a real long time ago.  And boy, have they tried over the years.  Boy, have they tried. 
[03:18:00]  So you got this guy.  Mickey's one of the guys, I guess.  And this is him doing his actual stand-up.  So we just picked one of his sets off YouTube.  And Patrice is here to critique it.  All right.  Now, I've brought Mike in.  Yeah.  All right.  That's not it.  What the hell was that?  I guess we got more audio because I guess our listeners, some would call them our pests.  have pretty much gotten to them today.  Already?  Yeah.  So now they're going back on the radio to try to explain what they meant. 
[03:18:30]  But first, we got a sample of Mickey's stand-up.  All right.  I love black people, man.  I do.  Sometimes they just, you know, get on my nerves.  I ain't going to lie.  I'm just, there's some shit we got to deal with.  And I know most black people like.  Holy shit.  Is this the same guy?  He sounds like Rocco on the radio and sounds like Jimmy Schubert when he's on stage.  He's kind of putting on some kind of thing there.  Like, like, hey, I like black people.  What is that?  But, but on the radio, it's like Rocco.  I don't get it. 
[03:19:00]  That's old.  Yeah.  What?  Right in the dumpster.  Okay.  Thanks.  And I know most black people like white people, but there's some shit we do that gets on their  nerves.  And I know how we can fix all the racial problems in the world.  Here it comes.  Let's be honest with each other.  There's some shit about each other.  This fucked up.  We just have to admit it.  Number one, I'm going to start with the white people. 
[03:19:30]  There's some shit.  If we're going to get along, we got to get along.  Get to it.  We get the premise.  Where's my NASCAR fans?  Oh, boy.  Stop it.  Pathetic, stupid, not entertaining.  How the fuck are you going to spend three hours on a Sunday watching fucking traffic? 
[03:20:00]  What the fuck?  NASCAR crowd.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  All right.  Well, he's getting a great reaction.  Maybe he's performing, you know.  NASCAR crowd.  Right next to Dan Cook, who's in another room or something.  You know, whatever.  I don't find that funny.  It's not my company.  If I heard it.  He's getting a really good reaction. 
[03:20:30]  Under these circumstances, it's easy to go, well, fuck him.  But I've heard worse, and I've heard better.  He's a guy on stage doing some comedy, and the people are laughing.  He's about what it is.  He's the new form of, and I've explained this once or twice, where when I watched Pryor  and Carlin in my life, before I did comedy, they didn't make me want to do it.  I didn't see it. 
[03:21:00]  They didn't influence me.  They didn't inspire me, because I thought I could never be.  Couldn't do that.  I can't do that.  That's something amazing.  Yeah.  I don't know how long this guy's been doing it.  He's an inspiration.  But this guy, if a young comic, you can go, I'm going to do comedy.  I could do that.  It's a spawn of a lot of this shit, and he's as good.  I'm going to be honest.  He's as good or as bad as Larry the fucking Cable guy to me.  I'm sorry.  He's as good or as bad. 
[03:21:30]  And he had the NASCAR crowd there.  So whatever, man.  Yeah, that works.  What the fuck?  This guy's not...  One more example.  Black people.  I know black people now.  You ain't getting off the fucking hook with nothing.  And hold up, Opie.  I'm going to tell you.  He's been doing it long enough to know that if you want to trash the other group, you do  the quick...  White people are...  You trash white people immediately.  NASCAR, stop it.  But he didn't go in-depth on anything.  No, no, no.  But he will guarantee you go in-depth on how fucked up black people are. 
[03:22:00]  But he did a Don Imus for NASCAR.  Real quick.  He offered up NASCAR to say white people are foolish on this level.  He could have gone off and talked about the NASCAR interior of the track barbecues and  white trash mullet-headed hillbilly motherfuckers.  Any fucking reality thing.  Right, right.  Any real thing.  Now, this is where he gets...  But he has it down pat.  Now it's NASCAR stupid.  All right, now let's go to black people.  Yeah, he said, see, I can make fun... 
[03:22:30]  It's fucking comedy 101.  101, I believe.  It's society 101.  But sorry, go ahead.  I was going to tell you.  Exactly.  First thing, black people, when we go to the movies...  Oh, come on.  Don't talk.  You might as well just...  Oh, my God.  Dude, that's hack material right there.  Yeah.  You don't even have to play the rest of it.  It was funny at one point in comedy, and it's still in some contexts when you're talking 
[03:23:00]  about the movies, it can still kind of be funny.  And it's still dishonest.  Bullshit and shit around.  It's the same thing.  Look, man, we was talking about this fucking Kanye West thing, and when I heard it, you  guys were talking about it, but when I heard it, and celebrities booed, the reason why that  was fake is because celebrities don't do anything that they're not supposed to do.  You don't just boo Kanye West.  You know what I'm saying?  Man, so someone gave them permission to not like Kanye West, and they don't just come 
[03:23:30]  out and go, fuck you, fuck you, Conway.  They look at each other and go, oh.  Maybe they looked around and saw people going like, oh.  And then they said, you can hate it.  Yeah, we can hate.  The point to saying black people talk in a movie theater, it's just, it's horseshit.  That safe, black...  If you're going to go in and talk about black people, be fucking honest.  Could you see now, we didn't even listen, if he says, like, I hate when black people  get up when their baby's crying and take them out of the theater. 
[03:24:00]  Imagine.  Well, it's obvious what's going to happen.  Let it play out.  Here it comes.  Shut the fuck up.  Right.  We get it.  We get it.  That shouldn't get a reaction anymore in comedy.  Not like that.  As a throwaway, sure.  The movie, the movie has words in it.  We don't need your bullshit.  Oh, gosh. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, my dear, sweet Lord Jesus.  He's getting a great reaction.  On the cross.  He's killing me.  People allow it, man.  I mean, it's just people, it's people's fault that they heard that.  And it's not his fucking fault.  He doesn't need to write anything fucking.  Well, let's wrap this whole thing up.  So they, I don't know.  They attacked us out of nowhere because one of their guys likes the show, our show, went  after us a little bit.  And where's E-Rock?  Because now, I guess, now this is becoming an even better bit because the hole is just, 
[03:25:00]  just, just.  The hole's out of control?  Out of control.  She's crazy.  She's crazy.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  E-Rock running is terrific.  E to the rock.  E.  So what's up?  Well, now the main hoe seems to be backpedaling and clarifying what exactly it is he said,  but the hole seems to really not like us.  Yeah, because we told him to fire. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah, to fire the hole.  So now she's feeling insecure, like, oh, fuck, I gotta, I gotta, you know, show people  that I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm worth, uh, stick around.  Yeah.  Yep.  She takes shots at the show.  But now the pressure's on.  They won't get rid of her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We just fucked up their whole chemistry, trust me.  Because they, they secretly understand that.  They, they, they know they don't want her around.  We just fucked up her world so bad.  Aw, poor thing.  Here's Mickey.  All right.  Now, uh, I've brought, uh, I've brought Mike in.  Yeah.  Because since about seven o'clock this morning, Mike has been completely worthless to the show. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  He is so worried.  Worthless.  I'm so, uh, distraught right now because apparently, uh, Opie and Anthony have taken  what I said because their listeners call him up.  That's what happens.  Right.  Out of context or whatever.  You're getting rides from Mike right now.  Here's all I said.  Right.  I go, I can't believe I'm driving to work at five in the morning and, and Mike, who loves  Opie and Anthony, is listening to the replay.  I said, all I said for me was, it was a little tough on the palate hearing the C word. 
[03:26:30]  Right.  Which I can't say on this station.  Of course not.  You know, 35 times at five in the morning.  Oh, stop.  And I said, and what I said was, the bit was funny.  Right.  But hearing that work.  But you only laughed twice in what, 20 minutes?  No, no, no, no.  I mean.  Hear the whole out.  Out loud.  Internally, there was lots of laughter.  Yeah.  I mean, it was funny.  Good.  Oh, we just fucked her up.  Yeah.  I know what's happening here.  Yep.  Yep.  Oh, is she insecure?  Aw.  And she knows it's true.  We're sorry.  Aw.  That the guys really don't want her.  Sorry, baby. 
[03:27:00]  Aw, poor thing.  And, well, Mickey's not being honest there.  Mickey.  He sounds like a guy that enjoys edgy shit.  You're trying to tell me that he can't hear the C word early in the morning?  It's a little too harsh at five in the morning?  That's, come on, buddy.  If you like that type of stuff, you like it.  There's not a specific time where you finally start enjoying that type of thing.  No.  And it's more dishonesty.  And I'm not saying this fucking guy.  I don't know the guy.  But to say C word instead of cunt.  Well, you can't say it, though.  You can't say cunt. 
[03:27:30]  Right.  But do you understand that saying a fucking, a variation of cunt means cunts in your life?  Yeah.  That's true.  Like, N word.  I've never heard nigger on TV.  Right.  Till I heard N word.  N word is nigger.  Now you know what it is.  But what is the context to ever say C word?  Because it's the replacement for cunt.  Of course.  And the people thinking they could get rid of the N word from our society, they had no clue 
[03:28:00]  what they were doing.  Because now, now more and more people could say the word by saying N word.  Like Patrice just said.  I've never heard nigger.  Right.  In a broadcast, a news broadcast ever.  I've never heard nigger.  Now you can say it.  But it's everywhere.  But it's just saying N word.  Motherfucking crackers invented a way to say nigger.  Right.  Yeah.  No one ever said it.  You're right.  No one said nigger.  That backfired on you guys.  That's why I said, if you think they're trying to bring down two iconic white boys for 
[03:28:30]  free, black people got to pay for this one.  We got to pay for Nappy Headed Ho and fucking Michael Richards, man.  I can't say nigger no more and neither can you.  Maybe not Michael Richards.  Right.  Well.  Well, no.  He was one of the sacrificial lamb.  He's his.  Well, I tell you, Imus is back with a goddamn vengeance because I think Fox bought his shit.  Yeah.  He's picking him up.  Yeah.  On TV.  Yeah.  Look at these two.  What's that face, motherfucker?  What is that?  What are you talking about?  What the fuck did I do to you? 
[03:29:00]  Just enjoy the show within a show, all right?  You're privy to the show within a show.  Holy fuck.  And this has now become, I'm going to say it, I don't mind Mickey now.  It's all about the whole because every clip that Iraq just gave me, it's all about the  whole trying to get her shit in there.  Yeah.  You know something?  I don't even care about Mickey anymore.  I think.  He seems like he's a pretty good stand up.  I wish him well. 
[03:29:30]  I really think he should change his fucking radio voice.  Just use your regular voice, bro.  You'll go a lot further.  I think what he was saying wasn't as harsh.  Get rid of the whole because, you know, you're doing guy talk for Baltimore.  No one wants to hear the stupid hole chiming in.  Nobody.  Trust me.  That's a management thing.  You know it.  So try to figure out a way around that.  Just try.  I think.  Just try to get rid of her and you guys might do all right.  I don't think he was being as harsh as initially.  Well, listen to the hole in this next clip.  But when you hear the C word over and over and over, I'm just saying it. 
[03:30:00]  I'm barely awake.  I got one eye open.  Mike's driving me in because my freaking car's not working.  And I'm just hearing that word over and over and over.  Oh, a little more knowledge.  It looks like Mickey and Mike both listened to our replay going into work.  Wow.  And when did you say cunt a lot?  When was his cunt a lot?  I know.  When is it like cunt?  Because I know sometimes it does get thrown around a lot.  But big cunt day.  When was the big cunt day?  It's rare, to be honest with you.  Because when you hear that word and we all use it, it's kind of, you take notice that it's just thrown out there. 
[03:30:30]  And it's in the context of, at the time, if you're talking about alimony.  Yeah, you're going to say, fuck the cunt.  It's very context.  But, I mean, you motherfuckers, man, y'all make some enemies, man.  These guys in Baltimore, the guys just trying to make a living as a comic.  And here you go.  Cunting this morning up.  Cunting up this morning.  We're going to turn Mickey around.  We're going to take the high road on this.  We're going to make Ricky.  Because he wants an out.  And I'm not even trying to make him say he wants an out. 
[03:31:00]  You can hear him wanting.  He wants an out of this.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't want to deal with this.  He's a fucking asshole pest.  We're going to make Mickey popular.  He's going to have to get rid of Amelia because she's a cunt.  Yeah, you've got to get rid of it.  See, the c word.  See what I did there?  You are fucking crazy.  That was crazy.  And I'm just hearing that word over and over and over.  I'm trying to smoke and drink a coffee.  And I'm like, oh, my God.  And I got a pretty harsh stomach palate for language.  You know that.  Yeah, you don't care most of the time.  But, yeah.  And I think it was looking at Mike's face. 
[03:31:30]  And it's like the way a stalker looks at its victim.  That's how Mike listens to Opie and Anthony.  Was he touching himself inappropriately?  I was scared to look over.  Well, Mick was in the car, so.  Yeah.  And for a guy who wants to be in terrestrial radio, for God's sake.  And I went on to say that I think Opie and Anthony are funner than Stern.  And I like them better on terrestrial radio.  All right.  Now we have absolutely no problems with Mickey.  He wants an out.  You can feel that, man.  He wants an out, and that's fair.  This guy is figuring out a way to get out of this tough situation. 
[03:32:00]  He doesn't want to deal with it.  Boy, those phones must have been a ringing this morning, huh, Ant?  He can't fight back the way.  Like, you guys could be just so much more horrible on satellite than he could be on FM.  You know what I'm saying?  It is brutal.  You're right.  He can't fight.  He just doesn't.  He don't want to deal with it.  Stern.  And I like them better on terrestrial radio.  Yeah.  Because I just thought it forced them to be a little more creative.  Yeah, because anybody can get on the mic.  It takes a while.  No.  And I just thought of something, too, just listening to this shit.  It hit me. 
[03:32:30]  The voice.  The thing that people do.  It's to replace.  That.  It's the only emotion because you can't express yourself with words.  Like, you can't say descriptive words anymore.  Yeah.  So you only can be descriptive in your, I hate her.  Yeah.  As opposed to being able to say something that really, how you feel and shit, man.  Right.  It's just like, that's the voice you have to have.  I'm angry.  That's why black, uh, black revs fucking use the voice. 
[03:33:00]  And I say unto you.  Yeah.  They're not really saying anything, are they?  No.  Come on, for Jesus.  Don't say, come on to me, motherfucker.  I run from church.  All right.  Good.  My fucking feet start burning as soon as I see one.  Eight of.  Yeah, because anybody can get on the mic.  It takes a while.  No, not anybody can.  That's not true.  And cuss.  No.  Oh, we're going to get, we're going to get Mickey.  This is my new goal.  To slap this bitch live on the air.  This bitch.  Is that her right there?  Oh, yeah.  Because she's still trying to fight the battle. 
[03:33:30]  I'm just licking.  She's trying to fight the battle, and Mickey's basically saying, will you shut the fuck up?  Yeah, because anybody can get on the mic.  It takes a while.  No, not anybody can.  That's not true.  And cuss.  No.  That's not true.  Listen to Brewer's show.  But you being a non-satellite listener is definitely-  I got satellite.  What are you talking about?  Everybody's a non-satellite listener.  What are you talking about?  It's like 1% of the population has it.  I don't know how many people have it.  I got it.  I enjoy it.  I like, like I said, I like Opie and Anthony.  Oh, this bitch.  We got to her.  You're going to be- 
[03:34:00]  She's not happy.  You're going to be so fucking gone from that show.  And you can't tell her to shut the fuck up.  You can't tell her to shut up.  We just fucked up your chemistry with the boys.  Trust me.  She is not happy.  Trust me.  Trust me on this.  And whatever the percentage of people that get satellite radio, what's great for us is  we're known across the country with our little radio show.  Yeah.  I don't give a shit what percentage of the people have it.  Meh.  A lot of people listen to the show, man.  And more and more fucking people are getting satellite.  And the one thing I noticed in recent weeks, you walk into businesses, it's all about satellite 
[03:34:30]  radio now.  It's everywhere in the businesses.  Yeah.  That's a great sign.  Mickey will be shredded now the fucking hole again.  That's what Iraq writes here.  I'm not going to-  They wanted to talk to us, but now they don't.  I don't know what's going on.  But they're going to-  So what's happened is I've become the shredding boy now on their show.  Right.  Because now they're going to play stand-up stuff of mine from YouTube.  Oh, yeah.  And they love to take audio and just sit there and pick at it for-  Yeah.  And I'm-  Look, this stuff's five years old.  He's promoting you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I love it.  So-  The only reason they're talking about us is because we're on terrestrial radio. 
[03:35:00]  But what's going to happen-  No, Tommy.  Dis-Amelia.  You know something?  Let me tell you.  I know your name.  She doesn't get it.  The reason we're not-  We were talking was because-  Oh, my God.  We assumed that this dude had a problem with us.  This Mickey guy.  It had nothing to do with being a-  What do you think?  We were on terrestrial.  We could have gone back again, still been on terrestrial.  We had a deal.  We had a-  Yeah, we fucking made the decision.  This is a lost art saying to a woman, shut your face, please. 
[03:35:30]  Oh, Mickey, shut up.  Please shut your face.  Pipe down.  Mickey's in hell, but he'll get out of it.  We ruined the chemistry.  Amelia, you should-  Shut your cookie hole, bitch.  You should start making your fucking demo tapes because, yeah, you're going to be looking  for work.  Clam up.  We're not talking about you because you're on regular radio.  We didn't even know about you.  And you guys mentioned us, so of course, it's going to pique our interest.  That's not even-  And second of all, since regular radio, we're still in the mainstream.  We did Fallon since getting off regular radio. 
[03:36:00]  Ant's doing the fucking Sean Hannity and Red Eye all the time.  It's just, it's what it-  Women are good at that shit, though, because-  What did that mean when she said it, though?  My girl does that shit all at once.  Yeah, but you hear Mickey's like, he's like, shut the fuck up.  She'll fucking start to say things that make you start thinking.  You know, like, you know, Anthony, the way he-  You know, I'm just being hypothetical.  You know what I'm saying?  Right, right, yeah.  Well, you know, I don't like-  I think Opie thinks about kicking you in your legs.  I listen to the show.  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, hypothetically, she'll just throw some shit where it's just like, have you go- 
[03:36:30]  Right.  Yeah, so she's just trying to be divisive, this girl with this fucking show.  No, she's pissed.  Because she found out that we called her a hole, which is the worst thing you could call  a woman in broadcasting.  She's probably like, I'm not the hole part.  She's like, I'm not the hole.  And no dude would go, yeah, you know, you're right.  They're jealous.  You know what's going on with Mickey and Amelia here?  We've all been with our girl.  Oh, no.  And all of a sudden you get into the, you know, there's something crazy happening in traffic  and your girl decides she's gonna honk your horn for you or start screaming. 
[03:37:00]  And then you're like, what the fuck?  I don't want to fight the fucking Hell's Angels.  What's wrong with you?  Just get that little good at it.  And that's what Amelia's trying to do.  And Mickey's like, shut the fuck up.  You gotta say thanks for-  Shut up.  Thanks for helping, beautiful, but shut your fucking mouth.  Shut up.  Because guys know, when we're battling, you size up the dude.  Like, I can't fucking beat this guy up, so I'm backing down.  It's nature.  And he was trying to give himself a respectable out.  A respectable out, which we all do in the real world. 
[03:37:30]  He needs it.  I don't need the trouble.  Well, here's producer Mike, who's the super fan.  Oh.  No, it wasn't my car.  I can't turn the radio off, dum-dum.  Yeah, he was getting a ride from Mike, and Mike is completely addicted to these guys.  Amelia is just so bothered.  Bothered.  We just ruined your chemistry with the boys.  And let's be honest, though.  I can't wait to see how this plays out now.  Let's be honest, though.  You gotta be honest.  If fucking Steve comes in and goes, boy, that fucking man cow, man. 
[03:38:00]  I can't get enough of him.  You'd go, what?  You would go, Steve, shut the fuck up.  So, I mean, it has to annoy him that their producer listens to Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, but the other guy-  It has to.  But the other guy listens.  He just can't really openly admit that.  Because he's got to be, you know, the guy.  Because he's a radio show.  I mean, shit.  He obviously listens.  If he was a lifeguard, this wouldn't be a problem.  He's a fucking, he's a peer.  And he's very aware of what we do.  Who gives a, I don't care about him anymore. 
[03:38:30]  I just want to hear Amelia.  A ride from Mike, and Mike is completely addicted to these guys.  Anyway, back to Opie and Anthony, who I said are funny.  Did I not?  You also said that you're funnier than both of them.  As stand-up.  That's a fact.  I would agree with that.  Yeah.  I'm not arguing that.  And Jim Norton.  No, I said I'm not funnier than Jim Norton.  I just want to clear that.  He's like so nervous that we're going to say something that's going to like offend  them or set them off.  Mike, are you trying to get a job with them or something?  No, I'm not sure.  I didn't even bring this up today.  I just.  Oh, we got another call, Mike. 
[03:39:00]  Maybe it's an Opie and Anthony listener.  98 Rock, good morning.  Oh, I guess that was getting a little hectic over there.  Yeah, he just sees it.  It happens, man.  And so I was trying to, like, say that we don't have pests anymore.  Yeah.  Trust me.  Really?  Yeah, there's a few guys that think that whole movement's gone.  Yeah, that Twitter issue.  And boy, holy shit, did they unload.  It's not God.  Trust me.  All right.  And then Mickey saying O&A mad for the wrong reasons.  Whatever's going to happen to me today on their show, I already know I'm getting shredded. 
[03:39:30]  So whatever.  I don't care.  At the same time, Mike, I want you to take a deep breath.  Your radio career is going to be fine if Opie and Anthony are mad at me.  I know.  It's just.  Boy, then he can't call the show anymore and tell them how much he loves them.  And here's the funniest part.  She's so mad.  You got to love it, though.  I love that she gets mad.  She's all spunky.  You got to love how mad she is.  She's spunky.  That's what.  It's so easy to get to a woman.  She's really pissed.  You got to love. 
[03:40:00]  So easy.  You got to love how fuck.  She's fucking hilarious.  Hilariously angry, man.  We just fucked up her world.  Can't call the show anymore and tell them how much he loves them.  And here's the funniest part.  They're mad at me for the wrong reason.  Yeah.  They think I was trashing them.  This is what happened.  O&A's producer calls up.  He's like, hey, you guys want to talk to the guys?  And we're like, I said right away.  I go, yeah, totally.  I think what they were expecting is us to go no so that they could go back on the air and  be like, oh, they won't talk to us.  Now, they're not calling back. 
[03:40:30]  No, that's not true.  Here's what happens.  I think our history proves that we've talked to a bunch of these shows before.  What happened?  Did Steve jump the gun and actually call first and then come and say, do you guys want to  talk?  Is that what fucking happened?  Because first of all, it doesn't make sense to get into a running discussion with these  jocks that we have fights with until a base has been set.  You know, like we're running the audio of them.  Then we have to comment.  And then in the future, if things keep, you keep bumping heads, then you might get the 
[03:41:00]  live phone call on the line to yell at each other.  That's usually how those things play out.  But did Steve see the second we start talking about it, Steve jumps the gun and makes the  phone call instead of coming in here and going...  Can I snitch on Steve?  What?  I don't want to be a snitch, but I was sitting there.  Steve got them on the phone.  The producer knew Steve.  Uh-huh.  And Steve said, would it be okay?  Would the guys come on?  Why is he saying that, though? 
[03:41:30]  But he did this before you knew.  Before you even knew about this shit.  He had...  But why wouldn't you...  But I think it's not bad.  That seems to be something to ask us.  But he was setting up, would you get on the phone just in case you motherfuckers...  Because Steve knows your history.  If it's De Niro or something, then fine.  Right.  If it's a couple of jocks that are perhaps or allegedly giving us a bad time,  then, you know, maybe we want it to play out a little first.  And let the listeners know what it's all about. 
[03:42:00]  I say Steve jumped the gun on that one.  Because then it makes us look silly.  Steve, what'd you do?  Steve?  Hello.  The first thing I said was, I tried to find out what exactly sparked the discussion.  That lasted about three seconds because the guy recognized my voice.  True that.  And asked if it was me, and I was like...  Is this a homosexual?  No.  That's not what he said.  Oh, I thought you said that.  And he explained the whole backstory. 
[03:42:30]  And down the line, I said, well, listen, I don't know how this is going to play out.  Would you guys get on the phone if it boils over?  And the guy says, I don't know.  I'll ask.  And that's when we brought the stuff to you.  Steve, just tell him the complete truth.  That is the complete truth.  Oh, my God.  He's just sitting there.  Yeah.  That's exactly what happened.  This is what he's adding.  He's being honest, except for one thing.  What did I say?  We have a witness today.  This rules.  The only...  He's...  He's...  Steve's nervous for some reason.  I don't know why.  He always is. 
[03:43:00]  I always is.  I always am.  I always am.  In case this boils over is pretext to something.  He...  It wasn't in case it boiled over.  It was, would you guys get on the phone and talk to the guys?  Right.  He was setting up the live confrontation.  So there wasn't any...  It wasn't...  Just in case or later on if...  It wasn't as architecturally structured as he's...  Because he's trying to make it...  But all you got to do is say, Steve...  He did jump the gun. 
[03:43:30]  A little bit.  But he was trying to...  He was...  It was all in the best nature of the fucking show.  Because now...  Because he was on the phone.  Let me say this on his behalf.  He was on the phone for fucking 10 minutes trying to make...  Check these...  These...  This Baltimore show.  See?  That's trashing my guys.  So he was being a loyal guy.  But listening to this now, it gives them...  It gave them a little bit of ammo.  Yeah, of course.  It made it seem like we reached out to call them and then we said,  Oh, they're going to talk to us? 
[03:44:00]  Oh, fuck this.  Fuck.  Because we normally just want to go,  Oh, they didn't even want to talk to us.  No.  And then they say,  All right, we'll talk to you.  And then we don't talk to them.  It makes us look bad.  So in that situation, you should come in here first and say,  Hey, guys, do you want to talk to those guys?  And we'll go,  No.  We don't want to talk to them.  We're just going to fucking play their shit.  We're going to rap about them a little bit.  And our listeners will fucking pester them a bit.  And then that's it.  More importantly,  Why does he have a t-shirt that says pot roast muscle?  It says East Coast muscle. 
[03:44:30]  Oh, well, I'm not even joking because the E looks like a P and the mic was covering up the pot roast muscle.  I swear to God, I didn't see the S in there.  It looked like it said pot roast muscle.  No, it says East Coast muscle.  Oh, my God.  Steve Carlisi is an O&A soldier, my friend.  Thank you, Patrice.  We're running out of show, unfortunately.  So we only have six minutes left.  We have two minutes of clips.  Then we have to try line of the day and get the fuck out of here with Patrice O'Neill's plugs. 
[03:45:00]  Let's go.  Let's go.  Oh, now that's what I'm going to tell you.  So the producer calls.  Right.  Hey, do you want to go on with the guys?  Mike's like, do you want to go on with the guys?  And I'm like, yeah, let's talk it out, right?  Let's see what happens.  And so then he goes, all right, I'll call you back.  Well, then he called back and he's like, I don't know if they want to go on.  Here's what I think he was trying to do.  I think he was trying to get our hotline number so they could jam that, too.  Because he's like, well, can we call you guys?  And I'm like, well, I'll call you.  So why don't you give me a number?  And eventually I gave myself their number.  See, now his producer.  I was there.  Yeah, I was waiting for that.  They can't give you. 
[03:45:30]  I don't know if they.  Dude, no one tells the truth in radio, first of all.  His fucking producer was going.  That's what drives me fucking nuts.  He was doing what Steve was just doing in here.  They both were going to each other.  I heard this shit.  Can we trade?  He did not go, hey, motherfucker, I'll call you back.  They both go.  They both were.  E-Rock, you might be out.  We got a new fanboy that wants to work for this show.  Wow.  We got to hire this mic guy.  Maybe we could do a trade.  Right.  This guy, this producer for E-Rock and 20 interns to be named later. 
[03:46:00]  Lamed Nader.  We'd have to give up a lot.  That'll probably.  No, not yet.  I was waiting for that.  They can't give you.  I don't know if they.  I guess they could.  Who cares?  The producer's a nice guy.  I'm sure he wouldn't do that.  So Mike hangs up the phone and goes, oh my God.  I just talked to ONA's producer.  And everything he's saying right now, he's choosing his words so carefully.  So wisely.  Because he knows they're listening and he doesn't want to agitate them.  What is wrong with you?  I have just.  Listen to me.  The producer's a nice guy.  I know he won't do that.  Listen.  Opie and Anthony, you're such a dick.  Listen.  You're such a pussy.  You're a pussy. 
[03:46:30]  But here.  I know.  Listen.  What are you afraid of?  You're playing with fire.  I've seen what they've done.  Who gives a crap?  All right.  Who gives a crap?  What do you?  He changes to this.  He goes like this earlier.  He goes, they're going to shut down our show.  They're going to shut it down.  I said they'll plonk the phone lines.  So what?  Nice.  Oh boy.  Yeah.  Mikey knows our show.  I like Mikey now.  I like him too.  He's fine by me.  Hell yeah.  Best of luck to you.  So far, Mikey, all right, Amelia, a cunt, and Spiegel, I don't know who you are because 
[03:47:00]  I don't even know if you're talking.  Yeah.  I can't tell.  One better than Stern.  Whoa.  We got to play this clip.  What did I say earlier?  I said having the guy, every guy call in pretending to be Larry King was hilarious.  Right.  They're hilarious.  See, the guy listens to our show a lot.  No, that's a compliment.  That's funny.  A lot of people liked that bit.  They're hilarious.  You ruined it today.  I know.  I said they're better than Stern.  Scott disagreed with me.  Now they're going to go in and trash me because I said hearing the C word 50 times from my 
[03:47:30]  house to here was just a rough start to the morning.  And what compounded it and made it worse was watching you drool.  Yeah.  You're like Opie and Anthony Gall.  Like Opie or Anthony.  I can't imagine.  It's like if you had, I know you're a caller to that show sometimes, but if you had some  personal relationship and you were worried about offending them.  I want you to get up right now and I want you to go to your car and I want you to listen 
[03:48:00]  to that show until we get into entertainment.  About 10 minutes.  Okay.  And then I want you to come back and tell me what's going on.  Okay.  Because I know it's driving you crazy that you can't listen right now.  So go out to your car.  They're going to replay it 20 times today.  That's the only content.  Mike, in fact.  She really, she really wants to go.  She really wants to go.  God, she wants to go.  She wants to go at your fucking faces.  First of all, we do. 
[03:48:30]  What's the matter?  The word cunt hit home?  She's going to scratch her eyes out.  She's.  Yeah.  Because that's all we have.  What are we supposed to do?  Stay on 12 hours a day.  We got lives.  That's terrible.  Oh, Amelia.  But I can understand the other guy that had, I don't know the names, but the, I think.  The guy, Mickey?  Mickey.  He's.  He.  Here's what happened.  He saved face.  A burst of, just a burst of, why don't you stop fucking sweating?  It's like my girl goes, I love Carmelo Anthony.  Boy, he has nice muscles.  So what, bitch?  So what?  My belly buttons are inny. 
[03:49:00]  And that's what happened.  Set the fuck up and stop telling me about somebody else's radio show.  Hey, Ron and Fez are back live, so we could go a few extra minutes, right?  Okay.  Because I know last week when they were on vacation, it was a hard out.  Yeah, we're going to go a couple extra minutes here.  You're out of your mind?  Well, you know.  Why?  Because then tomorrow we get to leave early and no one could yell at us.  But we never really do.  Figure it out.  Tomorrow, 10.05.  I promise.  Really, you get rollover time off of us?  Wouldn't that be good?  Kind of.  That's what we do now.  Oh, shit.  All right, so where are we at with this? 
[03:49:30]  Mickey, we'll leave Mickey alone.  Amelia, oh, ho, ho, ho.  I'll tell you this much.  Mickey, get rid of the whole, you know you don't want to be doing radio.  Mike's listening, by the way.  What's up, Mike?  Make sure Mickey hears this.  If you get rid of the whole, we will promote the shit out of you guys.  That's what we'll do.  Just dump her.  You'll do so much better.  And believe me, by the way, let me just add this in.  I know you don't want Amelia.  No.  They know this already.  It sounds like you're new to radio or at least Baltimore radio.  Get rid of her.  They know this, too. 
[03:50:00]  You know what they do?  When the guys are just hanging out, they're like, oh, God, did you hear what the fuck  she said today?  Believe me.  And I'm not just saying this to, like, try to stir shit up.  But believe me, it does happen.  I've never seen a case where the guys don't get together and then go, did you hear what  that idiot bitch said today?  God, we were rolling and then she just fucking put the handbrake on.  The big fucking train handbrake.  Yeah, we're on a roll.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, the hole up in their mouth.  They want to get rid of her, but they will. 
[03:50:30]  The program director and shit.  It's not even going to be the program director.  She's going to crack.  It's a chemistry now.  Chemistry thing now.  We really fucked up their chemistry.  And now, we're way too busy.  So, if you guys in Baltimore, in the Baltimore area, could kind of keep us abreast of the  situation.  Because this will end with her leaving the show.  The hole will leave.  And it'll be like, oh, was, you know, they all agreed that it would be best if she moved  on.  There'll be some kind of a fake story.  Our new bit is get rid of the hole right here. 
[03:51:00]  Get rid of the hole.  Lose the hole.  Lose the hole.  Lose the hole.  I like that.  That's it.  I think my brother Elmo can make a shirt.  It's lose the hole, and we try to get radio shows to see the light.  It's not like we have this power that we can have people get rid of their holes on the  show.  But we just want you to identify how unfunny and how much of a detriment to a funny show  they are.  You sound like, actually, a bunch of guys that are hanging out and having a good time.  Why the fuck would you want a chick there to fuck the whole thing up? 
[03:51:30]  And that's why you're being held back.  You're being held back until you get rid of her, because there's a lot of shows like  yours, where you're edgy, but then she has to jump in.  Oh, that's a good thing.  And the management will always say, no, that's a good thing.  It tames that.  It makes it like someone's in charge, and the women listen.  No.  It's a bad thing.  It's kryptonite.  Amelia, Amelia, Amelia.  Just look at her.  Look at her right now.  Go ahead.  I'll give you a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on. 
[03:52:00]  Because they'll listen to this tape.  Look at her.  Look at her.  She's ruining your show.  You sound like fun guys.  He said, look at her.  I didn't even know what you're doing.  You sound like fun guys that can hang, talk about fucking cool shit.  Nothing worse than an aging rocker, too.  She's an aging rocker.  Yeah, that's...  Look at her.  Oof.  Oh, boy.  You don't want to...  Wow.  What are you going to do?  Jesus.  Ah, come on.  Everyone needs a gig.  She's an aging rocker. 
[03:52:30]  I mean, she's so bad in real life that her picture on the website has to be cartoony.  No.  All right, look.  We did the same thing.  But we never claimed to be fucking, you know, GQ models.  I remember once we did.  Oh, one time.  Yeah, you're right.  Teasing, of course.  No, you're right.  I don't know.  I've never seen any other pictures besides that, so I can't really make a judgment.  But I do.  Her personality is ugly.  She has an ugly personality because all she can do now is bitch about us when they're 
[03:53:00]  talking about the show.  They're actually having an honest, open conversation about the program, which is fine.  Is that her?  No, couldn't be.  That's a porno star.  Oh, that's a porn star?  All right.  Why don't we do line of the day and get the hell out of here?  Line of the...  Mickey, we're cool.  Line of the...  But if you don't get rid of the hole one way or another, then we're not cool.  Yeah.  That's how we play it today.  Mickey's all right.  I got no problem with Mickey.  Because we know you want to get rid of her.  So we're kind of doing this with you, buddy. 
[03:53:30]  Blame us.  Right.  Make it like management listened and saw the light because they're such puppets or whatever.  And they, oh, they listened to ONA or something.  Just blame us for whatever you need to to get rid of her because she's really holding you  guys back.  I think I'm hearing good things.  It's not bad.  Except for, you know, her.  And the radio voice.  Tone that down a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  Get rid of that.  All right, Ant.  Line of the day time.  Why don't we just get right into this?  A runner-up line of the day. 
[03:54:00]  Stephen King's the horror writer.  The horror writer?  Okay.  Stephen King.  You read any of his books growing up?  Never read them.  Why?  They were always a movie.  That's what I say.  Okay.  Nothing.  It was just abruptly.  It kind of ended abruptly.  Well, I like that with their almost lines now.  That is true.  It's a paragraph of the fucking day.  Patrice is going to be at the punchline Thursday, Friday, and Saturday in San Francisco.  In San Francisco, yes.  Thank you, Ope.  Please go out and see Patrice.  Yeah.  You getting big crowds on the road, Patrice?  Not bad. 
[03:54:30]  They'd sputter in.  It's respectable.  It's respectable.  Are you all right?  What do you mean?  I wish I was filming when you were commenting about which girls you could still get.  Yeah, that was good.  Here in New York, I don't know if they do it.  It's everywhere else, but Wendy Williams is on.  Well, I know the show's everywhere, but here locally, they do kind of a warm-up show.  They kind of show the crowd getting ready for Wendy Williams, and they make it kind of  like a nightclub, and all the girls are dancing, and they got a DJ and stuff, right?  Really getting the crowd pumped. 
[03:55:00]  It's a smart idea.  And Patrice was pointing out the broads that were dancing, going, see that fat mess?  That's all I could get now.  That's it.  That's the energy.  That's me.  That's the energy.  I got this one bitch that loves me that, you know, she's eight years in, and then it's  like the 20-year-old girls that I see at the mall, like I said, when I try to wear my nice  hat and my mysterious attitude, nothing.  I ain't got no strength anymore.  Yeah.  All I am now is, hey, bitch, look, do you know what, uh, I'll ask him, you ever heard 
[03:55:30]  of a sugar daddy?  That's a motherfucker that buys you books.  And then I say, go Google the word pride and see if that's worth missing out on all  these goodies I'll buy you.  Anthony, I'm being called a liar.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  D.L. from, uh, Butler, New Jersey.  Butler.  Opie, you fucking liar.  You yelled, I could have been a model at a caller. 
[03:56:00]  Ah, you did.  I did say that.  Yeah, yeah.  I think you did.  You are a cutie pie.  Used to be.  You're still cute.  I'm in the used to be category.  You still got your little bang and everything.  It's still there.  Bangs?  Like your little thing.  You still got hair that's, you don't have to, I don't see it, the not, you know, it might  be the not sure it's falling out, but it's not, it's not all the way there.  I got some voodoo going on.  And if it goes.  I push this forward.  I push this to the left.  I move this over to the right.  If it comes to it, motherfucker. 
[03:56:30]  I pull it from the back slightly.  Cash in that self-respect and tell Anthony to give you that number.  You know, as much as I've beat Anthony up, you don't think I'm taking a look and paying  close attention?  He's almost back at mullet status.  That motherfucker.  I need a haircut.  You're scared to get a haircut after spending all that money.  You want to make sure it grows back again.  I used to grow in like fucking the old rot gun band days when I was in a band.  Then you go, you know what?  I think this procedure actually worked. 
[03:57:00]  I think I can get a haircut.  I think I can get a haircut.  Oh, in the morning I take a brush.  Sorry, Amelia.  That would be a very horrible.  Yeah, exactly.  Fucking whatever's going on.  I want to apologize to Amelia for being, you know, we're being very funny just off the  cough.  Nothing's written down.  We're just fucking around with Patrice here.  Why don't we do another runner-up line of the day?  You about a piece of shit to whack off Beyonce.  Kick your ass.  This is like, this is pretty close to like Sleeping Beauty just sleeping away, waiting 
[03:57:30]  for her prince, and there's a home invasion while she's sleeping.  That was good.  That was me?  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  What the fuck?  Thank you.  Where the hell did these pictures come from?  Is that, what the fuck is that?  That was one of our gigs way back in 92.  Who's that?  Is that Opie?  How is that me?  Look close.  That's Anthony.  That's me and my brother Joe.  And brother Joe.  Oh, wow. 
[03:58:00]  How the fuck is that me?  Fucking Anthony looks like a...  Wait, hold on.  That's back in fucking...  Oh, my God.  The old days.  I got a big afro.  You look like Weird Al Howard Sternovich.  That was another runner-up line of the day.  Oh, shit.  You don't have to cut it off.  You got an extra line in the fucking line of the day.  Jesus.  And we're not even supposed to be on the radio anymore.  Holy shit. 
[03:58:30]  Bravo, Patrice.  Good God.  Oh, mother Jesus, man.  Punchline.  Patrice O'Neal, I'm telling you.  Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  Patrice doesn't have to write half his shit down.  He just goes up there and brings the funny.  God damn.  What are we up to, Travis?  One more runner-up?  If it is...  Let's do...  Let's get me a load of air bashing, too.  Wouldn't stop a fucking air bashing while I busted up a frickle.  Didn't use no frang-a neither. 
[03:59:00]  It's a frickle.  I've never heard a call back and frickle.  Oh, that's hilarious.  I want to say hi to our brand new name.  Checking in, Anthony.  Pot roast Muscle from Woodside.  Writes, E-Rock should name his first girl, Amelia.  Amelia.  That's hilarious.  That's fucking hilarious.  That's really good. 
[03:59:30]  Meal.  Are we ready for line of the day?  We got to get the fuck out of here for Ron and Fez.  Hit it.  Here comes the light of the day.  Light of the day.  What about Jurassic Park?  That's a great fucking name.  That's a great name before you know that the movie was going to become a huge show.  Highside 2020? 
[04:00:00]  No.  Jurassic Park is a great name.  Jurassic Park is good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because the sci-fi movies would name it Dinosaur Forest.  I'll go right when I was 12 years old.  Oh, man.  That's your new board thing, man.  I know that fucking shit is coming every week.  Dinosaur Forest.  Right.  It's so fucking funny.  Dinosaur Forest.  That's what it would be?  We developed the most creative bits when Patrice is in. 
[04:00:30]  I got to tell you.  That came out of nowhere.  The fucking country music thing that we do.  We got to bring that back.  And then one of my favorites, the eating of the exotic animal bit.  That came out of fucking nowhere.  There's a motherfucker still will come up in the street and talk about that cheetah heels.  Yeah.  Cheetah heels.  Motherfuckers will forget about that.  Yeah.  That shit comes from a place.  That's good.  You can't think that shit out ahead of time.  If you listen to that again real quick, there's parts of that that it's funny.  The whole thing is absurd, but it's parts of that when you get in depth to how they kill 
[04:01:00]  animals and they take the most important part, which is the blowhole of the whale, I'm telling  you, it was social commentary.  It was.  What did we say about the whale?  You take the blowhole.  And it can't close it no more.  And it can't close it out.  And so it just has to sit at the top of the water.  So you're just wasting this massive animal just to get the dumb little blowhole.  And then it goes underneath the water and sinks.  Right.  Just a pile of whales at the bottom of the ocean because we have to eat the blowhole  with soy sauce. 
[04:01:30]  That bit is one for the ages, my friend.  Patrice, have fun in San Francisco.  We'll see you soon.  Absolutely.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Thank you very much.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Why do we...  We should just have Patrice come back in.  You want to do another day this week, Patrice?  I'm leaving Wednesday.  I can come back tomorrow if you have me.  Who's in tomorrow?  I don't know yet.  See you, everyone.  Let me know.  I would love to take advantage of Patrice O'Neal.  Jimmy's back, what, Thursday, right?  So, Jay Leno, tonight, everyone watch, man.  Leno's been great to this show over the years.  He starts at 10 o'clock tonight. 
[04:02:00]  He's got Jerry Seinfeld, Jay-Z with Rihanna, and is this great for Jay Leno?  Kanye West.  God damn.  The timing there, huh?  So a lot of people are going to be fucking watching Jay Leno tonight.  What a great way to start.  And then tomorrow, little Jimmy Norton's going to be on Jay Leno for his first time  with the new format.  Michael Moore and Tom Cruise and Jim Norton.  Holy mother of God.  So support Jay Leno.  He's been great to us.  See you guys tomorrow.  See you guys tomorrow.  See you guys tomorrow. </pre>
