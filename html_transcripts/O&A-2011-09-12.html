<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of NFL football, specifically the Jets' victory over the Cowboys and the Colts' struggles.  Jim Norton, back on the show, joined the hosts in voicing strong, often profane, opinions on player performances, particularly criticizing Tony Romo.  They also recounted negative experiences with athletes, including Chris Bosh's refusal to take a picture with Norton.  The conversation then shifted to Major League Baseball's ban on the Mets wearing 9/11 commemorative hats, prompting criticism of Bud Selig and the media's 9/11 anniversary coverage, which they felt focused too much on politicians and not enough on first responders.  Speculation followed regarding potential problems at the upcoming 9/11 memorial, such as suicide attempts and homeless individuals using the site.  A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to a humorous debate about Pearl Jam, with Travis revealing himself as a huge fan and the others expressing varying degrees of dislike.  They discussed the band's live versus studio work, song selection for an anniversary release, and compared them unfavorably to the Grateful Dead.

The show continued with a bizarre story about a plane's near-grounding due to three male passengers spending an extended time in the restroom, speculated to be engaging in homosexual acts, leading to criticism of the security response and media coverage.  This was followed by a transphobic and offensive discussion of Chaz Bono's appearance on *Dancing with the Stars*, extending to criticisms of Casey Anthony ("Tot Mom") and the show's overall quality.  The hosts then discussed *The X Factor*, comparing it to *American Idol*, and criticizing Kate Gosselin’s appearance and the cancellation of her reality show, using numerous offensive comments and vulgar language.  They briefly mentioned an upcoming appearance by Penn Jillette.

A discussion about Usher’s song "My Boo" segued into a conversation about music theft and the music industry's shift to digital downloads.  This transitioned into rumors about Usher's personal life, specifically the conception of a child outside his relationship with Chilli from TLC.  The upcoming guest, Tyra Banks, and her book *Model Land* were discussed, along with humorous anecdotes about previous interactions.  A nonsensical song about phones and a "tranny" was played. A lengthy segment followed focusing on the hosts' varied and often clashing musical tastes, with much crude humor and insults exchanged.  This led into a discussion about the physics of light and black holes, followed by an audio clip from Sam Roberts' show featuring Troy Kwan and Francine, recounting Francine allegedly rubbing her buttocks on Troy's arm.  This led to a discussion of Troy's dating preferences, his dislike of gold-diggers, and his admission of using sex toys, including "The Blue Mermaid."  The segment concluded with a debate about "hipster" culture and its perceived phoniness, and Opie's departure to the restroom, before the announcement that Tyra Banks would be their next guest.

Tyra Banks joined the show, engaging in playful banter about her appearance before discussing her career and *Model Land*, touching upon the darker aspects of the modeling industry.  She discussed her early career experiences and the criticism of *The Tyra Banks Show*, particularly an episode where she shared personal anecdotes.  The conversation then turned to the hosts' personal lives, followed by a discussion of a previously hung banner outside her studio reading "Fatty Pig Fatty", which Banks claimed to not remember.  The ensuing conversation degenerated into crude comments about Banks' physical attributes and race.  After Banks left, the hosts continued with sexually charged and racially insensitive comments.  A viral video of a young girl who doesn't want to be Black sparked personal anecdotes, including a racist experience one host had with a man who owned rental horses. The show ended with a discussion of Google Street View images, focusing on finding pictures of prostitutes, leading to more off-color remarks and a Metallica/Stevie Wonder mashup.

The after-show, hosted by Sam Roberts with Paul and Pips, centered around Anthony Cumia's repeated praise of the after-show, despite its past criticism of him.  Audio clips of Anthony's compliments were played repeatedly.  Discussions included the arrival of new interns, speculation about their treatment, and a listener call questioning Sam's reporting of Anthony's statements.  The conversation shifted to Tyra Banks' appearance, including the show's past criticism of her and a brief audio clip of a post-interview where she claims unawareness of the extent of their previous mockery.  JTX, a musician in full KISS makeup, unexpectedly appeared, promoting his song "Love in America."  Discussions about his music, Troy's previous argument with Francine, his use of the "Blue Mermaid" sex toy, and whether he was a "hipster" followed. The episode concluded with another clip of O&A mocking Tyra Banks' show, and a transition to the Ron and Fez show.

[00:00:00]  And now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for, it's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:00:30]  And now, the moment you're waiting for, it's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:01:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:01:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:02:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:02:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:03:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:03:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony Show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Well, it's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:04:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony is not politically correct.  The Opie and Anthony were saying it.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony.  So shut the fuck up.  The Opie and Anthony.  So shut the fuck up.  Where else are you going to be able to say that and get paid for it?  Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pride that I presented this, by the way, one of the highlights of my career.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  By the way.  Morning, everybody.  By the way, he's the guy that's back. 
[00:04:30]  He's back.  Yes, he is.  And better than ever.  He's back.  Yes.  Good morning.  I was going to text Jimmy last night because my team played his team last night.  That's true.  With Jets-Cowboys action going on.  I didn't know.  First game of the season.  You didn't even know.  Not until I checked football.  I was going to get a Dallas plan tonight.  Yeah.  And they go, they're playing the Jets.  I got home and I kind of remember, oh yeah, the game's on.  I'm like, ah, fuck them.  Yeah.  The Jets.  They're watching me.  Assholes. 
[00:05:00]  One way to look at it.  I was so, after Chris Bosh, that cunt blew me off for a photo, I was done with athletes  for the day.  Chris Bosh blew you off?  Yeah, he's a complete jerk off.  The fucking Avatar guy.  Big dumb voice.  But I was just so athlete disgusted by that point for the rest of the day, I didn't want  to think about these.  Why did he blow you off?  Because he's a jerk off.  Like 90% of the athletes, I bet he's a jerk off.  He's the third guy for Miami.  Exactly.  Jacob.  Jacob, face.  Hey, Jacob, face.  Jacob, face.  I'm sorry.  Ah.  I'm sorry for what?  Just take the goddamn picture. 
[00:05:30]  There was nobody around.  I'm like, two publicists or something.  There's no one.  No fans or nothing.  And he said no?  Yeah.  I'm like, hey, can I take a shot with you?  Because he was ready to leave.  He goes, ah, I'm sorry.  Ah.  And he kept walking.  What a douche.  He's an ugly man, isn't he?  He's horrendous looking.  His navel doesn't look good.  He doesn't look good.  I don't know how the chest up looks.  He's an asshole.  He's a tall guy.  Exactly.  A lot of people say he looks like an avatar fucking creature.  Oh, one of those avatars.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They've made that comparison over the years.  Yeah.  Or over the last year or so.  But the Jets absolutely should not have won that game. 
[00:06:00]  As a Jets fan, I'm not sitting here going, oh, look at my team.  But Tony Romo, fuck, he sucks.  He stinks, dude.  I love his ribs, though.  Oh, is that?  Oh, see, I thought.  Sanchez was a little shaky last night, but fucking Romo just handed the game to the Jets.  He's a piece of shit.  I mean, he might be a nice guy, but he's fucking not a big game quarterback.  He can't play under pressure.  I fucking can't stand Tony Romo.  Like he, at times, looks really good. 
[00:06:30]  But then when it matters, he fucking just doesn't do the right thing, it seems like.  Did he fall apart in the fourth quarter?  Uh, yeah.  He kept falling apart here and there.  Terrible.  And then the Jets' 50-yard field goal to win the damn thing.  50-yarder.  Oh, and then when it mattered, was this one?  Let me think.  Okay, so the Jets are up by three, and Romo's got one more shot at it.  And all of a sudden, the snap hits him in the fucking chest.  Whoops.  And goes, you know, fumbling this way, and he has to pick it up and then awkwardly try 
[00:07:00]  to make some ridiculous play.  I love that.  I love once they pick it up and then they're like, I have no idea what I'm supposed to  do now.  But the whole game's on the line.  You got one more, you know, pretty good shot at it, you know?  Yeah.  You're going to have a few throws in you.  That snap.  That snap.  Hits him in his fucking chest.  He wasn't even looking.  Pfft.  So.  Well, and then what?  I guess the Redskins kind of destroyed the Giants?  Yeah, the Giants got their ass kicked. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  You don't watch football though.  No, I see the highlights in the morning.  I check, you know, I like knowing what's going on, even if I'm not that interested.  You've got to kind of know what the local teams are up to, LP, what the local teams  are up to.  Keep it local.  Oh, that's right.  We're international.  Football rules.  Fuck that baseball that you follow.  Hey.  Three and a half games up.  It is football season.  No one cares.  The football season began.  Three and a half games up.  What'd I tell you?  The World Series.  How you doing?  How you doing, Yankees? 
[00:08:00]  I told you the World Series should have ended Friday, because now football's here.  Yeah, but I'd rather watch the fucking end of the baseball season than the beginning  of the football season.  Yeah.  Okay, get me halfway through the football season.  Then I find out who's injured, who sucks, who's good, whose record is like they're completely  out of the game already.  And then I'll start gaining some interest and watching and be a bandwagon jumper on whatever  team seems to be good.  The game of the weekend though, so you got the Jets beating the Cowboys, the Giants loss, 
[00:08:30]  right?  I feel so sorry for the Colts.  I feel so bad for these guys.  Oh man.  Peyton Manning's out.  Yeah.  Two to three months neck surgery.  He's out for the season, but they just don't want to say it yet.  Done.  And the team will be out for the season.  They're Manning-less.  Travis, you saw some of this shit, right?  It's just a disaster.  They got 38-year-old former quarterback, formerly retired QB, Kerry Collins, who looked  really old.  Look at the gut on him.  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  He fumbled two straight snaps in the first quarter, was sacked three times against the Texans. 
[00:09:00]  How old is Kerry Collins?  38.  38.  38.  But he was retired, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He wasn't planning on playing this year?  No, they called him and they said, hey, do you want to play for our football team, please?  Imagine getting that call.  It's just like, ah, you're sitting on your couch.  You're just shoving fucking chips and salsa in your face.  Vinny Testaverde got that call like three years in a row.  I love when the quarterback gets that call.  But in this case, Kerry Collins is just not ready.  He's got the same gut I do, man.  Look at that.  And I don't have to play in the NFL.  No, he's not ready. 
[00:09:30]  And the Colts have a very Peyton Manning offense.  Look at him.  He has perfect shoulders, perfect chest, perfect legs, but a big putt belly.  Look at that, man.  Perfection.  Oh.  I want the putt.  I want the putt.  Poor Kerry Collins.  I punch him.  It's going to be a long year in Indianapolis.  Do the Texans just lay down after a while and just go, okay, this game's fucking...  Yeah, I think they were up 31 to nothing at the half.  Oh, wow.  They put like all the third string guys in. 
[00:10:00]  They sort of kind of...  And they didn't even have Foster at running back who's like the best guy in the league.  Right.  Did Kerry Collins not have a good game?  No, it wasn't a good game at all.  He stinks.  I don't know much about the Colts.  Who was supposed to be their backup if Peyton went down?  Yeah, that's true.  That's how to get Kerry Collins off a couch.  I don't know his name, but I know that a lot of fans wanted him instead.  They were just banking on the fact that Peyton was going to be in it.  I don't know.  Who's Peyton Manning's backup, you know?  Well, that's true.  But not this guy.  When did he get hurt? 
[00:10:30]  Look at Romo falling apart.  There he is.  Oh, yeah.  Interception.  Oh, what a piece of shit.  I like watching Jimmy watch cowboy clips.  Romo basically gave the Jets the game.  Was that the last play that gave the Jets the final possession to get the field goal?  Yeah.  Yeah, but then the Jets couldn't move the ball forward, so we had to rely on a 50-yard  field goal.  But Dallas was moving, and he threw the interception at that last moment?  Yeah.  What a piece of shit!  He gave the Jets...  I hate him!  He gave the Jets the game. 
[00:11:00]  I'm telling you.  That's why I don't watch.  I'm this annoyed, and I hardly care anymore.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, is he shit?  Oh, I forgot about this one.  This is going to drive Jimmy crazy.  Go ahead, Chuck.  Tell Jimmy.  Oh, well, at the end of the third quarter, old Tony Romo decided to fumble on the one-yard  line.  That stupid motherfucker.  Fumbles on the one.  Yeah.  I forgot about that one.  If there's one thing you don't do on the one, it's fumbles.  He's amazingly bad when the pressure's on.  I don't understand it. 
[00:11:30]  He's a fucking...  There's nothing I hate more.  I mean, this includes Al Qaeda and the Germans in the fucking forties.  Nothing I hate more than a fucking athlete who can't perform under pressure.  Yeah.  I know it's gotta be hard.  Then don't be the quarterback for the fucking Cowboys if you can't perform under pressure.  You've told me this over the years, Jimmy, but I saw it firsthand last night watching  this game.  I'm like, wow, this Romo falls apart.  I almost can't enjoy the team if they're stupid enough to have this hunk of shit at the 
[00:12:00]  fucking helm.  Give me the ball.  I could have also lost.  You could have lost.  I could have lost as well.  I wouldn't have broke their fans' heart.  They would have known it was over quickly.  Yeah.  No expectation.  I want to get back to Kerry Collins, though.  Was he tired by the end of the first quarter?  I wasn't watching the game, but I have to assume so.  Huffing and puffing.  Yeah.  What are they gonna do?  They're gonna have a long year.  Hopefully some sit-ups.  Yeah.  The Colts are gonna have a long year.  You're right. 
[00:12:30]  Is he gonna give up on this year?  I don't know.  I mean, they're saying that Manning's gonna be out, you know, like...  Two to three months.  Two to three months, but...  But that brings you close to December.  I kind of think he's gonna be out the whole year.  Yeah.  And that ruins his streak of 227 straight starts.  Yeah, it's over.  Wow.  That's a hell of a streak.  A hell of a streak, Colin, but 227 straight starts.  Wow.  When did he get hurt?  Yesterday?  No.  No, he's been hurt, and he was recovering from neck surgery, and then he had more surgery 
[00:13:00]  last week.  He's hurting.  Yeah.  He's not recovering well.  He is hurting.  Why didn't they get someone faster than this?  What the fuck are they waiting for?  Well, with the lockout, you couldn't do any of that.  Oh.  Okay.  And then they weren't...  And for a while, he was on track to maybe miss a game, maybe miss two games.  Interception in the fucking fourth quarter, motherfucker.  Thank God he didn't watch.  That's why I don't watch anymore.  I hate him so...  I've never hated a player on my own team as much as I hate Tony Romo. 
[00:13:30]  It was a late start, you know, because we do this morning thing, and so many times  when I just turn off the TV, the Jets are just blowing this one tonight.  And then Romo just kept making it interesting over and over again.  I'm like, this should not be happening.  The guy is a fucking bum and a choke artist.  He's a fucking bum.  It's weird.  It's really weird.  He stinks.  He'll never win a big game.  He stinks.  Cocksucker.  When I heard the Cowboys lost, and it was last minute to the Jets, I knew this is what 
[00:14:00]  I would be hearing, and I adore it.  But that's why I don't...  Because I hate him.  I genuinely can't stand...  I'm sure he's a nice guy, but I detest him as a player.  America's team, Jim, come on.  I don't mind the team.  I love the helmets.  The fat kid likes the helmets.  I know you do.  But what about football?  But that fucking bum...  Peyton Manning is an example of a guy who does it time and time again.  Does he fucking fumble on the one yard line like a cunt?  No. 
[00:14:30]  And then throw an interception?  In the fourth quarter driving?  Mm-hmm.  Shit!  And Plaxico Burris did okay, man.  Good.  Terrific.  He did all right.  Yeah, he had a touchdown.  A few good catches.  Play for who?  Was he limping?  Huh?  How did he get shot in the leg and play football?  I don't know.  It's just astounding.  There are people that have been shot in the leg like 20 years ago, and they're still limping  along.  You know?  When I was on vacation, I took the corner of a glass table into my thigh, and I'm still 
[00:15:00]  not right.  You're still not quite up to par, right?  No.  This guy shoots himself in the fucking leg, and he's running for touchdowns in the NFL.  Jumping 15 feet in the air.  Yeah.  You're right, Ed.  I don't get it.  It's astounding.  I still have a Charlie horse, massive bruise.  How?  I don't know what's going on.  How's Kerry Collins, though?  You gotta imagine, he is so achy today.  Oh, God.  Could you imagine when he woke up and just went like, oh, just turned over in bed?  Oh! 
[00:15:30]  Some of us can relate to getting back to working out, and after that first fucking-  The first one.  The first one.  When you stretch your legs real hard and straighten them out, and you're like, ow!  Your thighs are just burning.  And now he's gotta get in shape somehow, so you know he's on a treadmill this morning  doing something.  And he's just thinking, oh, fuck, man.  What do I got?  A week, and I gotta do this again?  Romo cost me five grand four and three years ago, whatever that means.  I guess you have some bets wager. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, but why would you bet with Romo?  With that fucking-  I'd bet against Romo every time.  Every time.  That shit pile.  Why would you ever put your money?  He's a fucking choke.  Well, technically, the Cowboys didn't cover the spread, so.  Again, that means nothing to me.  He's a choke.  The guy just chokes.  It's what he does.  He does.  So I guess, technically, Romo made people money, though.  Just don't forget about the 20-point sprint.  It just chokes every time.  Can't lose.  Hey, what happened with the Mets? 
[00:16:30]  The guys weren't allowed to wear what?  They usually eat baseball?  The FDNY NYPD 9-11 hats.  They shouldn't be allowed to wear baseball uniforms.  All right.  Okay, shut up, Mets fans.  I got to be a Mets fan again, so that hurts.  Like, it doesn't even hurt anymore.  No.  I really don't follow baseball that much anymore.  No.  What did they want to wear, though?  They wanted to wear the FDNY NYPD hats that they wore the first game that they came back  after 9-11. 
[00:17:00]  Right.  Major League Baseball, specifically Joe Torrey, who made the decision, said no.  Joe Torrey made the decision?  Yes.  How does Joe Torrey make that?  Because he works for Major League Baseball.  So Joe Torrey is an asshole.  He said that he wanted everyone...  He's beloved in this goddamn city, but now he's an asshole.  The 10-year anniversary of Major League Baseball couldn't look the other way.  What was the reasoning?  He said that he wanted everyone to kind of be, you know, uniformly the same.  Uniform.  Just wear your hats. 
[00:17:30]  It's stupid, and it's gonna become a big deal, because there was no reason to say no.  I think Joe Torrey needs to, like, go play golf somewhere and enjoy his retirement.  What is he doing making these decisions?  Well, yeah, and then everybody's bringing up, you know, like, oh, well, the Pirates wore,  you know, special hats to honor, like, the military, like, last year, like, what's the big deal?  One of the Stengel brothers on Twitter posted Chewbacca throwing out the first pitch at one of the games,  saying, well, baseball had no problem doing this. 
[00:18:00]  Chewbacca.  Yeah.  That's just disgusting.  Yeah.  10-year anniversary, maybe the 9th anniversary, the 11th anniversary, but this was a big deal.  Well, let me tell you something.  From what I saw about 9-11, it was all about politicians and nothing really about the people.  It was about the news, the politicians, and nothing really about the first responders,  the fire department, the police department, transit authority, cops,  all those people that really died, all the people in the buildings.  They were trying to soak the emotion out of all the people by getting the children, 
[00:18:30]  they call them now the children of 9-11, and interviewing them about parents they never knew,  and do you think your daddy would be proud of you playing soccer team as they're sitting there,  like, like, interviewing these poor little kids?  Yeah.  It was despicable and disgusting, and I wanted no part of it.  And this just goes to show how quickly they forget things,  because why wouldn't you let them wear the FDN wine and wear the hat?  What would it matter in the end?  Right.  Hat. Who gives a shit?  It's the middle of September in Major League Baseball.  It's a bunch of guys who fucking hit a ball with a stick and run in a circle. 
[00:19:00]  Right.  And they want to tribute real guys who have died, cops and firemen,  and some other asshole who has an itchy fucking rectum,  and they used to fucking hit a fucking ball with a stick, said no.  Don't hold that.  That's what twats athletes, well that's not their fault.  That's why I didn't watch any of the fucking coverage,  because I knew it wasn't about these people anymore.  They've forgotten it.  If they weren't allowed down at ground zero for a commemoration, well, like, fuck it.  Well, the whole never forget goes, you know, pretty deep, 
[00:19:30]  and one of the things is let these guys do exactly what they did ten years ago.  It'll bring back that emotion.  Yeah, yeah.  Remember when the Mets did that?  The first game back, you're like, holy shit.  Yeah, it was cool.  What a cool fucking thing these guys are doing today.  Yeah.  And then ten years later, no, no, no, no, no, we can't do that.  Well, Bud Sealing could have stepped in, couldn't he?  But he didn't.  Not that he's a baseball committee.  Bud Sealing works.  I hope he grabs his chest and fucking falls down the steps.  He's valueless.  Ooh, am I tired.  Fuck, oh. 
[00:20:00]  Anything sports-related, I'm just going to want to vomit.  It's, it's just...  Yeah, why didn't...  This is coming in on Twitter.  Why didn't the Colts go after Favre?  Favre?  Jesus.  Another old fucking guy.  Why not?  I would take him over Kerry Collins, I'm thinking.  Well, not saying much.  Yeah, I mean...  Take Travis over Kerry Collins.  Brett Favre didn't have a great year last year.  But I would assume they looked at Brett Favre and realized, oh, fuck, this guy can't play  anymore.  Why would you go, look at this guy, look at the punch.  You know what, though?  He's enjoying his retirement. 
[00:20:30]  You know what, I mean, he played last year for Tennessee and he had a far better year  than Brett Favre did.  They probably, they probably figured, bah, we don't got to pay him that much.  It's, the season's a wash if we don't have...  I'm thinking if you're one of these quarterbacks that are sort of retiring, you would kind of  keep yourself in shape for the first year or two.  Just in case?  In case you get the Vinny Testaverity, I'm on the couch phone call.  The phone call.  Right?  Yeah.  Just a little bit.  You don't have to...  Who's that?  Your Y?  Mmm. 
[00:21:00]  Then he came back and did alright, if you remember Vinny.  He did alright.  Vinny T.  Yeah.  I like Vinny.  I liked him too, man.  Everyone did, didn't they?  So the Mets weren't allowed to wear their fucking hats.  Yeah, I guess that contributed to their, their loss.  And of course, fucking no commissioner.  They have no commissioner.  They don't have a commissioner in baseball.  Well, he says that, you know, he'll, he'll resign after the end of this contract.  He's an absolute jerk off.  What is that?  Next year, I think.  But he won't.  He'll, he'll sign again. 
[00:21:30]  I do more for baseball than, than Bud Sealy does.  I think, uh, everybody hates Bud Sealy.  Then why is he there?  Why am I yelling at you?  Because he, because the owners like him.  Yeah, he takes care of the owners.  Yeah, because he was an owner.  Yeah.  He's a political man.  He really is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Shit heap.  He's a, he's a shit heap.  He's a shit heap.  He doesn't let that guy fucking, he just does, he just does the status quo.  He's a status quo guy.  Mm.  Don't rock the boat.  You're a fucking bum.  Mm.  I, I just, I'm such a fucking dislike for any of these guys now. 
[00:22:00]  And my, my fuse is very short.  Yeah.  After having interacted with enough of them.  Yuck.  You've had it with them.  I really have had it.  They're just fucking assholes.  90% of them.  Ugh.  Uh, right.  They never truthful in the press conferences.  Yeah, you know, it was a good game.  Uh, you know what, uh, you just gotta play a game and hope that it, uh, ball rolls our  way.  Shut up.  Just say nothing.  You're quickly becoming not a sports fan. 
[00:22:30]  No.  In general.  It's almost like UFC is the only guys I can watch because as people I like them.  Mm.  I can't fucking enjoy these guys anymore.  Mm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's wrong with saying in that press conference?  Here's what he should be saying.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Let's listen.  Uh, it's one channel.  You know, we win that football game if I don't, uh, do what I do.  Play?  Yeah.  It's hard to swallow just knowing that.  Good. 
[00:23:00]  You know, we lost this game because of me tonight.  Should be used to that asshole.  It's very hard to make sure that you're putting those positions to, uh, to win the game.  And when, uh, when that happens, it's very tough to swallow right now.  It fucking sucks.  I think that, uh, um, I gotta do better.  Really?  Who was that speech five years ago?  I thought everyone did a great job tonight.  Ah, shithead.  The defense came out, got after them.  Um, guys were running good.  The O-line played real well.  Oh, shut up.  Um, like I said, we were in position to win the football game and- 
[00:23:30]  We know it's a football game.  I, uh, suck.  They played real well.  Mistake that cost us.  And that's-  You always do.  You always do.  That's what you do.  Well, he should've come out and went, I fucking did it again.  I fucking did it again.  That's what he should've said.  I did it again.  It's what I do, folks.  I fuck up.  That's what he should've said.  He should've said.  When the game's on the line, hand the ball to me, and I'll grab my fucking neck and go-  Oh! 
[00:24:00]  There you go.  There you go.  This is lousy.  Any other, uh, highlights from the weekend there, Travis?  Yeah, the Ravens beat the Steelers.  That was huge.  Oh, that's right.  That's your team, huh?  Oh, that's right.  It was a great game.  Yeah, 35-7.  Holy shit.  It was a great game.  It was a great game.  What, uh, what channel was covering that game?  That was on 2.  CBS.  And did they actually start the game?  No, they did not.  Ah.  What?  They stuck with the reading of the names.  Yes, yes, yes.  Oh, really?  Ah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:24:30]  Fox cut away at 12-59.  They said, that's enough for that.  Let's watch some football.  Fox is like, fuck, there's three names and they're like, bah, just watch last year's same  names.  Shit, we're on the W's.  There's no way they're gonna finish this in time.  No.  And so I start going back from CBS to Fox, CBS to Fox, and Fox cuts away.  Fox goes right to that Eagles game, 12-59.  Oh, yeah.  Why did they feel like they had to stay with that?  I don't know.  Why couldn't they maybe, I don't know, have the reading of the names, at least have the  game on in the background or something?  Yeah, I understand the reading of the names, like, for the people that are there and stuff.  Of course, but there's a big crowd, there's loved ones there. 
[00:25:00]  But my point is, enough channels are doing it.  It's not on 20 other channels.  Exactly.  Yeah, it's on every channel, so.  I missed the first touchdown.  Oh, did you?  Yeah.  Hmm.  How about they just don't show football on 9-11 on their channel if they're gonna do  that?  Well, that's true.  How about they just don't do that?  Yeah.  Why would they fuck the fans, instead of just making a decision, we're gonna show this  9-11 footage, we're not showing the game, or we're not gonna show the footage?  Hey.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  And quickly, the Bills killed the Chiefs.  Yeah. 
[00:25:30]  Do the Bills have a good team this year?  I don't know.  Well, nobody expected them to beat the Chiefs.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  41-7?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Wow.  That's a blowout, huh?  Yes.  There were a bunch of blowouts, really.  Yes.  A bunch of games that were early.  I think that was the biggest one.  Yeah, 41-7.  Mm-hmm.  So, I thought the 9-11 coverage was okay.  I didn't think they...  People misunderstood a lot of what I meant, as far as how I hated the coverage.  It wasn't like everything was, you know, shmummy dude. 
[00:26:00]  What annoys me is that some of the most important things to remember are the things that are pushed to the rear and no one remembers.  And then some of the other shit that is purely self-serving on the part of the news and on the part of these fucking politicians that just want to get their face on television.  That's the part that's brought to the forefront.  Why don't we...  I think a little more remembering of who did this and why they did it should have been injected into the 10th anniversary. 
[00:26:30]  I don't think it was enough.  I think George Bush did a great...  He had a great speech there in Pennsylvania.  Bush had a great speech, and that fucking Biden can talk, huh?  Well, he was...  You could see his head going for the teleprompter.  Why was he going?  Whoa, boy.  Bush is an emotional guy.  Yeah, Bush did a good job.  He gets red in the face a lot.  He does.  Tears up.  Very easily.  Yeah.  Did... 
[00:27:00]  I don't know.  Did Obama speak at some point?  Yeah, he did.  He was all right.  How was that?  He was all right.  They were all all right.  Was he campaigning?  No, no, no, no.  Yeah.  No, I don't think so.  Like, the big politicians like that I could understand, but when you get dopes like fucking  Bloomberg coming out, it's like, shut up.  You pretty much just hijack the election to stay in office.  And then they're like, well, let me tell you something.  Michael Bloomberg not afraid to ride the subway this morning.  And you know the train was checked beforehand. 
[00:27:30]  Don't make it seem like he's a regular Joe going out there.  Sick of that.  Sick of that.  Totally sick of it.  Yeah, I agree with you.  Ride the subway like we do.  Every time you get on that goddamn subway car, you wonder if it's going to be your last  day.  Ah, it's a crap shoot.  You don't know what the fuck is going to go on.  There's some fucking lunatics underground.  Ridiculous.  Not from Bloomberg though. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  So I wound up doing one of my basement shows there Saturday.  Yeah.  And it was a tribute to 9-11.  Oh, good.  So I got in a suit and ran some-  A dark suit, hopefully.  Oh, it was the darkest suit ever.  Good.  And ran some footage and completely just lambasted the media and the Muslim community.  Nice.  That was my whole thing.  Yep.  Thank you very much.  10 years later.  That's my coverage 10 years later. 
[00:28:30]  10 years later, I'm just numb to the whole fucking thing.  Like, I know we re-ran our show from 10 years ago.  Yeah.  I, once again, did not listen.  Don't want to listen.  People said it's a really good show.  I just don't want to listen to it.  People said apparently we had a lot of things-  Figured out?  Like, we were talking about how airport security is going to be-  It's done.  Walking through the airport and just running to a plane and not being checked over.  That's all done.  I think-  We said that day one?  Yeah.  Wow. 
[00:29:00]  We were talking about how you're going to be seeing, like you see in Israel and certain  other countries that are plagued by terrorism, you're going to be seeing armed soldiers  in train stations and airports.  This is all stuff we were talking about.  You said that?  Yeah, I know.  What the fuck?  We were known for dick jokes.  I know.  That-  We were seers.  That event absolutely made us get a little more serious with our radio show.  For that day.  Get it serious, XM, sell it on radio!  Before that, we didn't really take on anything really heavy.  We didn't have to.  The world was a much fun place, much more fun place before 9-11, 2001. 
[00:29:30]  And now what?  We were all waiting for the big 10, the big 10th anniversary.  Now it's just kind of, what, 11th anniversary?  12th?  Well, it's going to be like Pearl Harbor.  You know that.  It just goes away after a while.  No, not really.  It just becomes a footnote.  It never goes away, this one.  Nah.  I don't know, dude.  The footage will slowly get less and less.  But this thing-  Pearl Harbor here.  This thing has legs.  But here's what happens in Pearl Harbor. 
[00:30:00]  We get like the show prep and the little thing says, and you know, bloody, bloody years  ago, Pearl Harbor was attacked by the Japanese.  And then they cover it on the news for maybe three minutes at most.  They got some guy ringing a bell, some old veteran that was there.  And then it's done.  I guess it does fade.  But I mean, the actual site will never go away.  No, it's always going to be a memorial.  But there's a memorial at Pearl Harbor, too.  I mean, the USS Arizona is a memorial itself.  I'm sure people are checking out that memorial every fucking day. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, yeah, they do.  You know what I mean?  Oh, absolutely.  In droves, too, by the way.  It's part of going to Hawaii.  But then again, they'll get on a helicopter and take a fun, smiley tour of the volcanoes  and the waterfalls and things like that.  It's not just a whole day dedicated to remembering something horrible that happened.  So I think in time, and especially on the odd years, it's just going to be a footnote.  I think starting next year, yeah.  You're going to see a big tail off next year.  Yeah, a bunch of TV channels probably won't even really cover it. 
[00:31:00]  It'll be like a little footnote, a little side piece, a little here.  We've got a couple minutes on this.  I think we were waiting to get to 10.  10 years was the big benchmark of, wow, 10 years going by.  That's time to kind of look in retrospect as to what we've done in 10 years, how things have changed.  And that's like your benchmark thing.  And now you move on to 11 and 12 years.  You're going to be sitting there going, oh, right.  But 20 will be a big year.  25, definitely.  25.  Yeah, things like that.  But again, it's not going to be what it is now. 
[00:31:30]  And it all depends on what is going on.  It's kind of like high school reunions.  You look forward to the big 10-year high school reunion.  And then after that, you're like, are you really going to the 15th?  I don't know.  Who cares?  Where is it?  A Ramada Inn?  Yeah.  The 15th high school reunion.  Are you going?  I don't know.  Man, man, man, man, man.  See who else is going and then maybe you go.  Yeah.  My 25th is coming up in October.  I'm not going.  No, I still got a couple years before I get to my 25th.  What do you think?  What do you think? 
[00:32:00]  He just laughs now.  Oh, I went to a big one.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  That's when you brought...  Two years ago.  Yeah, I brought a 17-year-old.  That's so great.  No, I think she was 18 at the time.  Were they annoyed people?  Oh, people hated me.  Oh, those fucking haggard bitches hated me.  Did they know she was younger?  Oh, yes.  She was like, ah, being all goofy and kid-like.  That's what they do.  I'm like the fucking colonel on Boogie Nights. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  I just like to bring them to reunions, Jack.  I don't touch them.  Ah, you're despicable.  Do you like the 9-11 memorial they built down there?  I haven't seen it firsthand, but what I've seen on TV, it looks kind of cool.  I haven't seen it firsthand.  I haven't seen it close up, even in like a...  They're saying it's going to be the most visited place in New York.  Yeah, there you go.  Which is hard to believe, because Times Square is just a zoo every day.  Yeah.  With these farmers. 
[00:33:00]  That place is a fucking disaster.  Times Square, my balls.  Well, yeah, the 9-11 memorial will bring in a lot of tourists, a lot of tourist dollars.  Do you like what they did, though?  Do you like the actual thing they set up?  Yeah, it kind of looks cool.  You know, the waterfall-y thing is big.  I'll tell you what, guaranteed this, too.  You will be seeing...  This will become one of the foremost places to commit suicide in the country.  You think?  Yes.  Take a look.  You could crawl right over there and fucking do a header right into that... 
[00:33:30]  It looks pretty far down, the fountain.  I think you're going to be seeing a lot of people depressed about it, maybe some loved ones.  But this will become a place where people will...  They will have to put a fence up there, because people will start killing themselves in this memorial.  We have to put fences up everywhere.  That's how it goes.  It's just what's going to happen.  And I think I'm the first one to ever say that.  Thank you.  Are they going to keep the bums out of there?  The bums!  Bums!  Yeah, that looks like a place you could lay down and stink it up. 
[00:34:00]  Ya bum!  Yeah.  I don't know.  Because of the bums...  I think it looks good, though.  Because of the bums, you can't sit anywhere in New York City.  No, they put spikes on everything.  All the businesses, they don't want the bums in front of their place, so they make it very difficult to sit anywhere in New York City.  Every flat surface in New York City looks like a medieval mace.  If you could even find a flat surface.  Yes!  They're horrible.  They don't want them sitting there.  So, like, they put those little spike things on gutters to keep pigeons off.  They do the same thing on every flat surface for homeless people.  Or they take the flat surface and then make it into an angle so your butt has maybe an inch and a half to rest on. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  Nowhere to sit.  Doesn't work.  Nowhere!  Damn, homeless.  Yeah.  They're all crazy people.  People through the cracks came up financial bad times and are living under newspaper on a sidewalk.  They're bums.  And why isn't the memorial paid for?  I saw dinero last night begging for money.  It's not paid for?  No.  Well, we need more money.  He was very passionate last night.  New York.  Especially downtowners. 
[00:35:00]  We were the ones who suffered.  If you think 9-11 was bad, you should see my new movie.  I woke up early this morning again because I was in bed by like 9-30 last night.  Just keeping the worst hours that are humanly possible.  Oh, angel.  I know.  And the machete was on.  Oh, ho.  So I was watching that. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, boy.  And De Niro's in that.  And it's just hilarious.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  That dumb fucking laugh he does where his mouth goes down instead of up like a smile.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  Any big dramatic death scene he gets?  I didn't see that.  Yeah, he's pretty bad.  I don't know.  De Niro just hit a point in his career where a wowsy wow is not good.  Terrible movies, man.  Just not good.  Yeah.  People are saying that the bums will take a bath down there.  Any running water.  In the water. 
[00:36:00]  Any running water.  You know what?  It's supposed to be this touching tribute.  And the names of the lost are all around the outside.  Not the series.  The people in the buildings, you silly gooses.  And there will be a homeless guy that will stand up on there and start just pissing into  it because he has to take a piss.  Sure.  And then get belligerent with the cops that come over to him to make him stop.  Where does that inner hole go to?  Can you go underground and see that shit?  No, no, no.  That is kind of a mystery.  There's the waterfall.  The whole memorial, the two memorials are the size of the actual base of the World Trade 
[00:36:30]  Center.  What it was.  The buildings.  One and two.  And it's a waterfall that goes in on the walls, the inside walls.  And then a little lake-like thing.  And then that water goes into this hole in the middle.  And where does that go?  Center of the Earth?  Center of the Earth.  Where does it go?  Yes.  Millennium Falcon hiding down there?  Yes.  So they realize it's a big worm?  Yes.  What's going on?  I don't know.  What happens down there? 
[00:37:00]  I don't know.  Daily News.  This is a good newspaper.  I'm glad there's no bias.  What happened?  Just the way they say, a way to connect.  A long-awaited stunning memorial is finally unveiled.  A shocking sense of reality makes itself brutally felt.  That's the headline.  10 years after fanatics in hijacked airlines brought down the World Trade Center.  The nation yesterday paused to honor those who perished.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  Fanatics.  10 years after fanatics.  That's what they are now.  That's what you gotta do.  That's what your media does for you. 
[00:37:30]  I'll tell you what.  Right now, Travis is considered a fanatic of Pearl Jam.  I'm definitely a fanatic of Pearl Jam.  But are you an Islamic extremist?  No.  Okay.  I think that they should elaborate a little more on what fanatic means.  Well, from now on, I'll bet you there's been a little thing at the Daily News.  From now on, let's just call them fanatics when we reference it.  Yeah, yeah.  Once again, sanitize, clean it away.  Like the Philly's mascot.  Yeah.  Exactly.  The Philly fanatic was on a plane.  It was crazy.  Wait, mascots did this, Doug? 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, mascots.  Fuck.  Mr. Met couldn't make it.  Head wouldn't fit through the plane door.  He wanted to.  He cried, actually.  It's despicable.  It's despicable.  You know what else the lovely liberal media...  What was it?  The public radio?  National Public Radio did?  Shit.  Did you hear what they did with Obama's speech?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Sure, they edited the transcript.  They edited the transcript of the speech.  No, the PBS.  And took out...  PBS, was it?  I'm sorry.  Why?  Because he made a mistake and said that Abraham Lincoln was the founder, one of the founders  of the Republican Party. 
[00:38:30]  And it's not true.  The Republican Party was formed years before he became a member of the Republican Party.  And some of the newspapers had, and the news had his transcript, as it was, him saying,  Abraham Lincoln, one of the founders of the Republican Party, which was a mistake.  And PBS changed the quote.  They removed it.  Removed it and put in something else.  Put in something else that made it sound like he was talking about Lincoln being part 
[00:39:00]  of the Republican Party and not a founder thereof.  What are they doing?  Now, any Republican that makes a mistake, a faux pas in speech and history, is just fucking  brought out on the carpet.  Oh, the dummies!  The dummies!  This dummy doesn't know.  But the liberal PBS media will change the actual words, revise history, to protect their  boy when it comes to this.  Give me a break.  Yeah, I don't want to fund PBS, to be honest with you, for once.  No, I don't either. 
[00:39:30]  Or do we not fund them?  Are they funded by just donations?  The National Endowment of Women.  I don't know, right?  And viewers like you?  Yeah, viewers like you.  Viewers like you?  Yeah.  Alcoa?  Does Alcoa fund them?  I don't know.  I sure like that fucking Ken Burns' Civil War.  That was great.  Why?  What are they saying?  This says that PBS published President Obama's prepared remarks, the written ones, as opposed  to his actual speech, where he introduced the part about Abraham Lincoln founding the 
[00:40:00]  GOP off the cuff himself.  You know what?  Then fucking that isn't a transcript of his speech, is it?  PBS is not responsible for Obama or anyone going off script.  Hey, hey, hey, no, no, you transcribed the fucking speech, not with this.  We have show prep laying around here.  If we don't get to it, does that mean we did that in the show?  They published his prepared remarks.  Look, the biggest lie was that there's show prep laying around here, I understand that.  We got stuff.  Of course we do.  We got things.  Real quick about the 9-11 memorial and the bums. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  You need a ticket to get in, so they'll be kept out.  You need a ticket to get in to see a memorial.  What does that mean?  Cost you money?  No.  I mean, you can donate if you want, but it's free.  Can I get a wristband?  No.  No, you print it out online.  Is that like a wishing well?  Will people throw money in there, you think?  I think you can.  You think they go, ping!  It's like Small World.  It is.  Is it going to be like the museums, where the museums are free, but they make it look  like it's not free?  Donate?  Like when you walk into the museum in Natural History?  No, no, because I...  Suggested price, $20, and everyone pays it because they don't realize that your museums are free 
[00:41:00]  in this country?  Museums are free?  Yes.  I didn't know that.  Exactly.  They don't want you to know that.  Yeah, nice.  You can walk into a fucking museum and go, I'm walking through.  But then what they do is they do the special, whatchamacallit, museums that aren't free,  so that's how they get money.  Special attractions.  Attractions or whatever.  And exhibits.  But in general, yeah, museums are fucking free, but they, right at the front entrance,  they have a big, you know, suggested price, $15 a person, whatever the fuck it is, and  you can walk right in and go, I don't want, I'm walking in for free today. 
[00:41:30]  No, yeah.  Is that, I bet you that's what's going to happen down there, though.  No, I secured my tickets online, and...  How do you secure a ticket?  You go to the 9-11 Memorial website, and so they ask for all of your names because then  you've got to show ID when you get there that matches the ticket because I think it's  a security concern, and also they want to limit the amount of people that are in there  at a time, so you buy your, you get your ticket at a time, you know, like 1.30, 2 o'clock,  2.30.  Maybe that'll change. 
[00:42:00]  I hear what you're saying, but I'm leery.  What's the real reason they're doing this, you think?  Keep the bums out.  Why?  Because bums don't have fucking webpages.  They don't have computers.  I think security.  You really think it's security?  Sure, you've got to show your ID, you've got to be the guy on the ticket.  They don't want Al Qaeda.  Yeah.  You're not going, hey, I want to come in.  You've got to do it online, so I'm sure they've got, you know.  Yes.  Yeah.  So anyway.  Where's that hole in the middle go?  I don't know.  I'll find out.  I'll let you know.  It's a mystery. 
[00:42:30]  I'm going on Wednesday.  You're going Wednesday?  Yes.  How far is it sold out for?  Was Pearl Jam playing there or something?  No.  Oh, I assume everywhere you go, Pearl Jam is playing.  Yeah, that's all I do.  Why are you beating him up with the Pearl Jam?  I love the Pearl Jam, too.  Because...  20 years, sir.  20 years.  You love the Pearl Jam.  I'm obsessed with Pearl Jam.  Yeah.  Well, I kind of am, too.  I just don't talk about it.  Are you going to buy the book?  The only channel worth listening to on this dumb service besides us.  Pearl Jam channel?  Oh, and a few others.  And, of course, that one, too, yes.  Is the Pearl Jam channel.  Sam, when he's standing in for anybody and everybody on this platform. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, Sam, when he's doing the news or playing unlistenable music and hits one.  I'm surprised he hasn't posted the Pearl Jam channel yet.  Sam added another show for free, by the way.  Did you really?  Yes.  Today's show is sponsored by poppers and holes in the bathroom wall.  Dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk.  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  Yeah, great.  That Pearl Jam channel is great.  It's great.  But I've heard every fucking song and every concert at this point.  You can hear them all over again.  Yeah, you're right.  I saw him last week.  He's obsessed.  I know he's a bigger fan than me. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, he's obsessed.  You know what they opened with last week when you saw him?  Huh?  And with an elderly woman.  Nice.  You would have loved it.  That's great.  I seem to recognize.  The only elderly woman I want to see open is that elevator door opening and getting her  hat in the room.  I can't even talk, but Jesus, it made me laugh.  I love seeing her get her fucking white hair knocked back.  Oh, the Frank Vincent do?  Oh, yeah.  That's great.  You never liked the Pearl Jam, huh?  No, no.  I like a few of their hits.  Some of their deeper shit is good, though. 
[00:44:00]  I can't go within one inch deep on Pearl Jam.  Really?  They debuted a new song on Jimmy Fallon.  I have to keep my head above water.  Did they?  Yeah, it was really good.  They're all Pally Wally with Jimmy Fallon.  Yeah, they did two nights.  Two nights in a row?  Yeah, that's cool.  They did a new song and then like a track that was released on like a B-Sides CD, which  was awesome.  Yeah.  Why didn't they put a live on their 20th anniversary thing?  Oh, well, I put like one of their most popular songs on.  I read somewhere they weren't going to put a live on there or something.  On what? 
[00:44:30]  The soundtrack?  What do I know?  I don't know.  On the thing.  The 20th anniversary thing.  I don't know what you're talking about.  There's so many 20th anniversary things.  It's awesome.  The main 20th anniversary thing.  It's a celebration of Pearl Jam.  Did I dream this?  It might not be on the soundtrack.  I mean, the soundtrack is...  Supposedly they left the song off.  They may have, but the soundtrack, you've got to talk to Cameron Crowe.  He's the one that did all that.  The 20th anniversary thing, Ant.  They decided, look, everyone knows a lot.  We don't need to put it up there.  Nah.  But it was their fucking biggest song.  It's a big hit.  It's a big hit. 
[00:45:00]  You should put it up there.  You think it was bigger than Jeremy?  Just for history's sake.  Well...  No, of course not.  Jeremy.  Jeremy was huge.  Oh, maybe it's Jeremy they let off.  It might have.  Look, I've seen them over a dozen times and they've only played that once.  They don't like playing Jeremy?  They've got so much to play.  Is that a big hit for them?  Jeremy?  Is that like Ozzy not playing Paranoid?  Yes.  No, because Pearl Jam plays a different set every night and you may never hear that.  But they barely throw in Jeremy. 
[00:45:30]  They've got to throw in Jeremy.  Yeah, but they throw in even flowing alive every time I see him.  Yeah.  Eddie looks pretty fucking great.  Awesome?  Yeah.  Wait, that's him today?  That was last week.  Holy shit.  That fucking guy hasn't aged.  No.  He's still...  Why is he wearing a flannel shirt?  Come on now.  Because that's Eddie Vedder.  You're trying to bring that back?  That grunge thing?  No.  That's a...  I'm very comfortable in what I wear.  Alrighty.  Yeah.  You're gay for Eddie Vedder.  Yes. 
[00:46:00]  They do nothing for me.  I wish I liked them.  I like the one thing he does.  They do a cover of fucking Ramones.  You don't like...  I believe in miracles.  Oh yeah, they do a great cover of that.  I hate...  I can't stand that.  You know?  I acknowledge he's a good singer.  I just...  I hate him.  He's got a great voice.  You guys are ruining this.  Just play Jeremy every once in a while for the people. 
[00:46:30]  They probably do.  Oh, look at the rod he's got in his pants.  Oh, Travis.  Sorry, guys.  He's playing with himself.  He got both hands in his pocket playing with himself.  Rocket pool.  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no. 
[00:47:00]  What's your favorite Pearl Jam song, Travis?  You better go deep or you'll look like a fanboy.  You're probably given to Fly just because it's my favorite thing to see live.  What?  Why?  It's a good song.  It's a great song.  And it's great live.  You only like a fly if it's opening in front of your face.  With the monogram, the E.V. underwear.  Because it's Eddie's cock.  Funny.  I think you're talking about Earl Varnish. 
[00:47:30]  Jeremy the Ripper.  I like this song.  You like Release Me?  Yeah.  Love that fucking song.  I hate that fucking, you know, that 50s song.  Oh, Last Exit?  That's a cover.  It's all right.  It's just a cover.  That wasn't even...  Shut up.  It's great. 
[00:48:00]  You really know Pearl Jam for a guy that hates him.  I hate that one, though.  What is he playing?  Nothing we talked about.  Travis said Last Exit, so that's what I threw up.  Oh.  It's not Last Exit.  I didn't say it.  The one that Ant's talking about.  I may have said Last Exit.  What's the name?  I don't know the name of that one.  I forget it.  Where, oh, where came my baby?  The love to get away from me.  Yay.  You like Yellow Leadbetter?  A lot of people are saying that's their favorite. 
[00:48:30]  Yellow Leadbetter?  Yellow Leadbetter.  Is that a reference to Leadbelly?  No.  No.  What is it?  I have no idea.  Is that his last name?  Give me a little Yellow Leadbetter.  I mean, they close with it almost every time I see him, so I can do without it now.  Was Jimmy Fallon playing with them or no?  No, he did a...  They did a little skit.  They did a little skit.  You like this one, right?  No.  This song's okay.  I don't like this song.  What Pearl Jam do you like? 
[00:49:00]  This, by the way, is one of the funniest things in that lyrics that you don't understand thing.  Oh, yeah.  This one is by far the fucking funniest.  Yeah.  But, no, I don't like this song.  Yeah, I'll tweet that.  I actually have that in my favorites.  What's the singing?  What is it called?  Misheard.  Misunderstood lyrics.  Misunderstood lyrics.  I like that glorified version of... 
[00:49:30]  Glorified G?  Glorified G, yeah, that's good.  Glorified G is a great song.  They played that last week.  I like that one.  And the song Ant's talking about is Last Kiss, not Last Kiss.  Last Kiss, I'm sorry.  Last Kiss, right.  What's he singing about here?  I don't know.  He's singing about...  No one knows what he's singing about.  I'm pretty sure there's no official lyrics to this song.  What do you mean?  How can there not be lyrics?  Because he changes it up all the time.  What's he saying here? 
[00:50:00]  I don't know.  How about you?  We really don't know.  Nobody knows the words to this song.  No, we really don't know.  How cool is that, Jimmy?  That no one knows the words.  Jimmy's angry.  Jimmy's the one to say some pride idol.  Fucking Pearl Jam.  All right.  We can do this all day.  Oh, of course.  Give me Last Kiss, because that's the cover that Ant doesn't like.  But knows every word of it.  Eric's probably right.  I probably did say it last time. 
[00:50:30]  He knows every word, but he hates it.  I had to.  You know, he heard it so many times.  That was a holiday single.  That wasn't even meant to be.  Here it turns out.  This is fine.  No.  Not one of my favorites.  It's his best writing.  It's not his song.  I know.  That's hence the joke.  Right.  We get the live version.  Thank you.  Thanks for the live version.  Live versions are way better than the studio versions.  Are they? 
[00:51:00]  I can't listen to Studio Pearl Jam anymore.  Oh.  Yeah.  We have something in common.  I can't, because I've heard the way that it's done live so many times that that's what  I want to hear.  You know what?  Wow.  Ant, I got to say, Pearl Jam over the years have become a great live band.  A great live band.  Well, that's what they do.  Travis is kind of right with this.  When you listen to this Pearl Jam fucking channel on SiriusXM, you don't want to hear  studio shit anymore.  I'm only interested in live stuff.  What do you write?  What do you get?  A cut of the money?  I can't stand most of the channels on SiriusXM.  You have to go next time they come. 
[00:51:30]  Especially the music ones, but Pearl Jam, every time I jump in my car.  Will I get all...  I'm sorry.  It drives my wife and other people that drive around with me fucking crazy, because I can't  get enough of it.  Will I get all caught up in the moment, Travis, if I go to a live show?  And I'll be like, Travis, this is fucking great.  Yeah?  Two and a half, three hours.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Fucking shooting.  30, 40 songs.  Do they play in Montreal?  Yeah, they played last week.  You know what?  I've never seen Pearl Jam live. 
[00:52:00]  You gotta go next year.  And I've seen hundreds and hundreds of concerts.  Wait, when do I go?  Probably next year.  They'll probably do New York next year, maybe.  Fuck that.  Where can I fly this weekend to see them?  Somewhere in Canada.  They're doing Toronto tonight.  I'd go to Toronto.  Tonight.  Hang out with the Asians.  Okay.  They're doing Canada and then South and Central America.  Oh, they're gonna go to Montreal?  They did Montreal.  That's where I saw them last week.  Oh, that's why you took some time. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Took two days off to go see Pearl Jam in Montreal.  You rolled.  That's what my vacation is for.  Oh, man.  That's great.  That's awesome.  18th row.  It was awesome.  It was good?  Yeah, it was great.  What was the highlight of the concert?  Probably Give It a Fly.  Really?  Yeah, it was pretty safe.  They did a pretty safe show.  Not a lot of covers.  Not a lot of deep tracks.  What's their favorite cover?  What's my favorite cover that they do?  Yeah, yeah.  Bob O'Reilly.  Yeah.  I was gonna say, they fucking do The Who pretty damn well. 
[00:53:00]  They do a few Who songs.  What's the Bob O'Reilly cover?  Why don't we play it into break?  There's a live version into that.  You wanna play it into break?  Yeah.  Yes, I do.  It's up to Ant.  You wanna do this?  Oh, let's roll with it.  It's The Who.  You like The Who?  I like The Who.  Let me sell it this way.  I'm doing The Who.  Four less minutes of radio.  Yeah, that's good.  Maybe five minutes of less.  I actually do like the...  We don't have to do this, sir.  I do like that version.  It's a great version. 
[00:53:30]  They did a good job.  They do.  Yeah.  You wanna play this in a break?  I didn't say I have hatred towards...  It's not like The Grateful Dead, where I could not sit through one fucking song, and  the thought of going to a dead show like years ago, even when Jerry was around.  Never been, never wanted to.  It just looked to me like they were tuning the entire fucking time, and I couldn't even  be bothered.  Oh, I love The Dead.  But, yeah, Pearl Jam.  I've seen Pearl Jam.  I fucking...  It's time to go again.  Is it?  Yeah.  You've never gone to a dead show? 
[00:54:00]  No.  I'm with you with the drums and space bullshit, but in general, man, when they...  Fuck The Dead.  If they peaked just right, it was magical.  Oh, God.  Really?  I don't go as deep with The Dead as most people, but I fucking like a lot of dead songs.  Hey, you wanna buy some spaghetti in the parking lot?  Yeah, we're selling spaghetti to get money for some shrooms.  Shut up.  Shave your fucking legs, you bitch.  Yeah.  You filthy, smelly, hippie cunt.  I'll do Pearl Jam Radio.  I'll do the Grateful Dead channel.  I'll tell you two specialty channels I absolutely will not do. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  Bruce Springsteen, which is gonna make Roland very sad today, and fucking Jimmy Buffett.  No thank you.  No Parrot Head Radio for you?  No thank you.  Yuck.  But The Dead and the Pearl Jam channels, I'm in.  Yeah.  You sure you wanna do this, Ant?  Yeah, let's do it.  I could eat.  He wants to do it.  I could eat.  Let's do this.  We'll go to break with this.  Oh!  When we get back, remember last week you had the weatherman in the fucking tub with the 
[00:55:00]  dead guy?  I think of it every single day.  We have a story after the break that is similar and might be better.  Very...  What do you think?  That's a bold statement.  What do you think, though?  You know the story.  I know the story.  I think it's too different to compare the two.  Am I selling it too much?  Yeah, and I think it's too different to compare the two.  It's a...  It's a good story, but it's too different.  It's a great story.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a great story.  And it's something they've been talking about a lot in the last, I don't know, what, 12  hours. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  But there's a nice little twist.  A twist that we heard that me and Opie just...  We looked at each other real quick, and just, like, our jaws were dropped, like, did  we just hear that?  And I hope it's this one.  Fantastic.  Is it this one?  Because weren't there two?  There were two, yeah.  Is this the one, though?  I think that's the one.  Okay, good.  All right, but first, we got some live Pearl Jam for everyone.  Yeah.  John, are we missing?  Paint you still, bro.  And we'll see you next time.  We'll be right back. 
[00:56:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:56:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:57:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:57:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:58:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:58:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:59:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:59:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:00:00]  I'm not from around here.  I'm from Utah.  Utah.  What the fuck is that?  It's west of here. 
[01:00:30]  Anyway, do you think you can give me directions to the Apollo Theater?  No.  You can't talk.  It was too crowded.  What do you mean crowded?  Can I say the N word a little bit?  No.  No.  Can I say the N word?  No, we can't say the N word.  What the fuck?  Come on, man.  Come on, man.  What are you, racist or something?  What are you, racist or something?  This is my accent.  This is my accent.  All right.  All right.  I just say fuck you in Jewish.  Trust me.  Trust me.  Dude, what the fuck, man?  Are you serious?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  No, you what the fuck?  I said what the fuck.  Okay, I know.  You said what the fuck. 
[01:01:00]  You said what the fuck a thousand times already.  That's all you say.  What was I talking about?  I just figured what the fuck I was talking about.  I just figured what the fuck I was talking about.  Um, your blatant racism?  Ah, yeah.  No, how come Polish girls don't like dildos?  Because their teeth fall out.  What the fuck?  Wow.  Just, just, just wow.  All right.  If I'm facing east, now which way do I got to go?  Nah, I start from the bottom, top, top and bottom.  I don't know what the fuck I would do.  What?  I don't know.  What?  It's an elf.  I can't, I cannot understand you. 
[01:01:30]  Like a minestrone.  I can't understand you.  No, no.  It's exciting.  It's exciting.  It's all of you.  I've had enough of this.  I'm going to get the fuck out of here.  Get the fuck out of here.  I'm getting the fuck out of here.  Get the fuck out of here.  I'm gone, you mumbling asshole.  What are you, retarded?  It's possible.  Sirius XM.  XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, yeah.  I hear the train a-coming.  It's rolling around a bit.  And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when.  I'm stuck in Folsom prison.  And time keeps dragging on.  But that train keeps rolling.  On down the sand and tall.  Lost Johnny Cash eight years ago today.  No way.  Eight years ago.  Eight years ago already. 
[01:02:30]  I would have guessed four.  Yeah, no kidding.  Fuck it.  Turn this up.  Let's just listen to Johnny Cash all morning.  Now, are you a Johnny Cash fan?  Not one of them fanatical, crazy-ass fans. 
[01:03:00]  But I like him.  He's aight.  He's aight?  He's aight.  Yeah.  Fucking Johnny Cash.  Jimmy loves Johnny Cash.  I certainly do.  Jimmy turned me on to Johnny Cash.  Well, The Wall is probably my favorite song by him.  I have a lot of them.  I knew a couple basic songs.  And then when I was hanging with Jimmy when we were off the air,  he had a lot of Johnny Cash in that car.  Was it off the air?  Wow, yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Oh, fuck yeah. 
[01:03:30]  We were driving around.  You're like, oh, you got to check this one out.  Now I know a little more about Johnny Cash.  Johnny Gage.  He is enjoyable.  Just that voice of his.  Holy shit.  Fucking amazing.  By the way, the Pearl Jam fell flat there, Ant.  Yeah, a lot of people saying that.  Yeah, this will make you happy.  TrevC8 on Twitter.  The Pearl Jam cover of Teenage Wasteland was the most horrendous thing I've ever heard.  Thank you.  And then Blue Heeler KY writes, the cover of Teenage Wasteland was horrendous.  Yeah, someone said something like, who? 
[01:04:00]  How about fucking why?  I want to get it done.  That means we got to try another Pearl Jam song for everybody.  No, we don't.  Until we get it right.  That's all right.  You sure?  Yeah, I think we're done with Pearl Jam for today.  For today and the week and month and probably year.  So 9-11 has come and gone once again.  Did it?  I didn't even notice.  I didn't cover it at all this year.  Ten fucking years.  Ten fucking years already. 
[01:04:30]  And what?  We got a terror threat, huh?  Yeah, there was a terror threat.  There still is.  Oh, the news.  Yeah.  Driving in.  One guy on the news just basically said, on the news.  Jesus.  Can we come up with another name for that?  Another guy on the, what looks like is news, but it's really not news.  It's horse shit.  Basically said, when it happens.  Yeah.  They're talking about a lone wolf and it's going to happen again.  And when it happens, I hope we handle it correctly. 
[01:05:00]  I hope we're able to handle it.  What does he mean by that?  Like not mention the real motives behind it?  Right.  Sanitize it by just saying fanatic and not that it's an Islamic radical, if it is.  Yeah.  It's going to be a lone wolf.  Fanatic.  Lone wolf McQuaid.  But what are we looking for?  We're looking for a few guys.  Three guys.  Yeah, there was supposedly three guys they're looking for.  And at first, of course, they were saying, these are Americans.  But they didn't say if they were naturalized citizens. 
[01:05:30]  They turn out to be Pakistani, Arabs, whatever the fuck it is.  They didn't say that?  No.  At first, it was just that we're looking for.  But then they started saying, all right, here's who we're looking for.  Because they realized, I mean, we ought to tell people who we're looking for.  And then the security was crazy and the tunnels and everything.  I think the security is so crazy because they just, they're scared.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  And I think they put the security out to that level, hoping they, wherever these guys are,  because they're not really sure where they are going, you know what? 
[01:06:00]  Ah, fuck.  Yeah.  Why don't we fucking wait this one out?  Because I think a lot of this shit happens all the time, but you just don't know it because  they got it under control.  When it's not under control is when you see it at this level.  It's just my opinion.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I think it's because it's around 9-11.  And if anything did happen, boy, there'd be hell to pay.  It's 9-12.  And we went through a checkpoint this morning, sir.  Yeah.  And Kenny yelled to himself about one of the officers calling him lazy. 
[01:06:30]  What?  Because we had to, like, get in line on, what was it, 7th Avenue, I guess it would be, right?  6th Avenue, whatever the fuck.  I forget which way we go.  6th Avenue, maybe.  And a van pulls in front, so it's a van and then, you know, Kenny's car, and the van is  just riddled with graffiti with a questionable person behind the wheel, and he goes right  through the checkpoint.  And aren't they looking for vans?  Vans, trucks, yeah, rental vans and things like that. 
[01:07:00]  So this particular officer, and you know we support all these guys, he decided, ah, we  don't need to check in this van.  Did they check you?  No.  Yeah.  They didn't check anyone.  Going through the Midtown Tunnel, I noticed they were checking box cars, box trucks, and  the biggest trucks that are able to go into the tunnel.  But I'm there in a big escalade, just driving right through, all my tinted windows and shit.  But you know what, and believe me, I think these terrorists would kind of look around 
[01:07:30]  and go, boy, they're checking every truck.  Why the fuck would I even try?  Right.  Instead, maybe split it up between a couple of big SUVs.  They don't even check.  You drive right in.  There's no way to completely make yourself safe.  But maybe that's what they're really checking for.  What?  And they're giving the illusion they're looking for, like, a...  They didn't give me a check.  I went right through.  I drove right through.  You could holler one of those.  Like a maniac, too.  You could take all the seats out of an escalade.  You got some room in there for some stuff, right?  Massively nasty shit in there. 
[01:08:00]  You got stopped twice yesterday when you got pulled over.  No, you didn't.  I did.  I was in a van shooting for the Tonight Show shoot.  It was where this guy, Ruby, drives.  And I think he's Latin, but he looks like he's Middle Eastern.  So we got pulled over at least twice, actually over the weekend, and pulled over a side behind  the columns.  They talked to him.  They take his neck.  That's what they do.  Do they look at the vehicle?  Oh, yeah.  Do they do the mirror thing underneath and all that shit?  I don't remember.  The guy yesterday didn't because he recognized me, but he still made him put his name down.  They just take everybody's name, I guess, if there's a problem. 
[01:08:30]  I don't know if Jimmy was a terrorist.  And the guy's like, it was Jim Norton.  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  And he blows himself up.  I thought he was eating a candy called an Al-Aqbar because he was yelling at him.  I didn't check the graffiti van today, though.  No.  No.  That's how that shit works.  But, oh, boy, everybody on edge yesterday.  Yeah.  We had fighter jets.  What?  Scrambles, as they say.  They were scrambled?  They were scrambled?  They scramble them.  Which flight was this?  I like mine over easy. 
[01:09:00]  Actually, my fighter jets.  There was one going to, from New York, I guess.  To L.A.  Or to New York.  L.A. to New York.  Yeah.  But wasn't the other one from Denver, the good one?  Yeah, yeah.  That's the good one?  I believe that's the one with the guys that kept going to the bathroom.  And they were spending an inordinate amount of time in said bathroom.  Three guys.  Three guys.  And now they're hinting that it was probably gay sex in the bathroom. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  They were making out.  And that's why the fighter jets were called.  Three fucking fruit jets.  Yeah, three guys that just couldn't wait.  On a long flight with nothing to do.  So they're going in and out of the bathroom.  And then at one point, they're just in there for a long time.  And they're trying to get them out of the bathroom.  And they won't come out of the bathroom.  So now there's just a massive panic.  And the fighter jets were called.  Yeah, quite a lot of taxpayer money.  Yeah.  Quite a lot of taxpayer money to get a fighter up in the air and trail a passenger plane. 
[01:10:00]  And then all the shenanigans that have to happen when the plane lands.  It's just because three guys couldn't fucking wait to get that luscious cock into each other's mouths, I guess.  I guess.  Huh?  I guess.  They needed that gay sex.  Wow.  And they're being very careful about it on the news right now.  Yeah.  They are admitting that two of the guys may have been making out.  Making out.  Oh, God.  Just.  Can you wait? 
[01:10:30]  Can you just wait?  So for those poor people on the flight that were in a complete panic.  Yeah.  Seeing fighter jets outside the window is because the three guys were in the bathroom.  Yeah.  Doing what they were doing, man.  That's a great story.  It's something they wanted to fucking have a circle jerk in the fucking bathroom.  Great.  Which?  Perfect timing.  At least the second part.  Kenny, were you annoyed they didn't check that van today?  Yeah.  What happened there?  I just told a story with the graffiti van. 
[01:11:00]  You know a lot about security?  What's your take?  Yeah.  They should have made an effort.  Yeah.  You think it was just lackadaisical some cops out there?  Well, you got the code set up.  Everything's set up for a little check here and there.  So maybe you should have checked that one.  I don't know.  Or wait.  We're just dopes on the radio.  And what do we know?  Maybe they have this system in place that we know nothing of.  You thought that was lackluster?  Yes.  I thought they should have made an effort. 
[01:11:30]  Thanks, Kenny.  Sure.  The high-flying drama unfolded after at least one passenger spotted one or more fellow customers  hitting the head.  They're good at right news.  Yeah.  Hit that head.  An unusually high number of times, prompting the red flag.  But what were they doing?  Going in and out, like, taking turns on one guy or something?  I think all three of them were just, let's go in there.  Let's kiss.  Let's make out.  That's pretty fucking... 
[01:12:00]  Would they really need fighter jets if it was three obviously gay guys?  Let's be honest.  We all know three obviously gay guys running to the toilet together.  Would you really think that was an act of terrorism?  No.  I heard it was two Israeli guys and one Russian.  Really?  Yeah.  Who is the bottom?  Who is the Baltimore?  I think they made a Russian sandwich, the two Israelis.  I don't know.  Fucking...  I think a Russian would fight to be the top, wouldn't you think?  I don't know, but...  Maybe not.  After being a Russian, you're so used to being dominant, he probably has a big bottom. 
[01:12:30]  A big bottom?  A floppy party bottom in the bathroom with an airliner.  A few people asking how the fuck did three people fit in there.  That's a good question.  And how are they allowed to even go in three people?  Just...  Long flight.  You know.  What?  People don't pay attention to who's going into the bathrooms?  Those stupid...  What do they want to be called now?  Stewardesses or whatever?  I believe they're flight attendants.  When you're on one of those long flights, they give up after a while and you see them  just reading magazines. 
[01:13:00]  They're not paying attention.  That's true.  I feel like they've done their job.  They've told you how to fucking buckle your seatbelt and they brought you your shit.  Now it's time to sit back.  Well, this could lead to the Chaz Bono thing on Good Morning America.  Why is this Chaz Bono getting so much fucking press?  Dancing with the stars.  They get the hot celebrities or the hot people in the news and they make them dance. 
[01:13:30]  So Chaz is dancing.  And she had this to say.  So are you surprised by all this?  You know, to be honest, I really haven't been paying that much attention to it.  I'm really kind of just focused on dancing and enjoying everything that's happening.  And I think everybody else, it's a much bigger deal to everybody else than it is to me.  Well, then you have tremendous powers of focus.  I congratulate you on that.  But in the piece right there, you did say that America really needs to see this. 
[01:14:00]  What does America need to see?  Well, I mean, I think that, you know, that I'm just a regular guy.  That all these ideas.  What?  No, you're not a regular guy.  You have a vagina.  Yeah, stop it.  Stop with the regular guy crap.  Stop it.  Yeah, you're right.  There's a hole there.  There's no penis.  You can't commit to the dick.  You're not a guy.  Commit to the dick.  Commit to the dick.  What are you doing, greedy?  Commit to the dick.  If you want to have a baby, you're not a guy.  Just call yourself a woman with a beard. 
[01:14:30]  Right.  You can't have it both.  Why does everybody...  If she had gotten a dick put on her and said, I'm having my reproductive organs fucking kicked out.  And add a dick to me?  Yeah.  I would have said, all right, call her a man.  She got a dick put on, whatever.  But if you want to keep the vagina so you can have a baby, indecisive.  Is that what's going on there?  I'm guessing.  Why else would you keep the vagina?  I don't know.  I just can't believe it's the same person.  I'm just amazed by that. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, the voice sounds very manly, though.  Tell you that, huh?  No.  It's the lack of commitment that bothers me.  Jesus Christ.  How long am I doing this?  A little sarcasm-y.  But I was trying to figure out if it's starting to sound manly.  It doesn't sound that womanly.  It's kind of in that...  It sounds like it's a progeria kid.  They hit this mark where they sound like a progeria kid.  It's kind of the in-between voice right now.  That all these ideas of, you know, children shouldn't watch me.  I'm going to be confusing. 
[01:15:30]  All of this stuff is just...  It's crazy.  And for all of the, you know, kids and teens out there with gender dysphoria, I think it's  going to have a really positive impact.  I know that when I was growing up, if I had seen somebody like me on a show like this,  it would have made all the difference in the world in my life.  Well, good for you, because the rest of us would have ran away screaming, it's a monster.  It's a monster.  I don't know what that is.  It's not a cock.  It's got a beard.  But kids won't ask, because kids won't know.  Kids won't know.  Kids won't give a shit. 
[01:16:00]  And what was that term he, she used?  Gender dysmorphia.  Gender dys...  Or no, is that what it is?  Gender what?  I don't know.  Eh, got a pussy but wanted a cock.  Dysphor?  Dysphoria.  Dysphoria.  Dysphoria.  Oh, because you know what it was?  She wanted to get a dick put on and went, hey, dysphoria.  Point at us.  I don't like the fact that she did not commit.  That annoys me.  The indecisiveness.  Fucking make up your mind, motherfucker.  You can't have it both ways. 
[01:16:30]  I think her reasoning was that the dick surgery is not as refined as the turning a penis into  a pussy surgery.  And it's not really useful.  Ball, they take fucking skin grafts and tendons and all kinds of shit and then try to throw  it together into a cock and it's got to have a pump in it or something.  I don't know.  Can we at least curse her with balls?  I don't even know how you put balls in there.  I think what they do is take the labia.  Just get a couple of fucking, I don't know, ping pong balls and put them in there. 
[01:17:00]  They put some kind of a, what are they, it's like silicon balls in the labia.  And then they take the clit and they cut it and put it on the underside of whatever kind  of cock they've built so that you have some kind of sensation.  Where does the cock meat come from?  Do you know this?  Legs.  Legs.  They take it from inner thighs, things like that.  I'm trying to think.  Where would I?  It just sounds horrible.  I was a chick who was putting a dick on me.  I'm trying to figure out where I'd get my cock meat from. 
[01:17:30]  You get your cock meat from?  Maybe, maybe like, I get very calloused on my heels.  Yeah?  Can you use that for cock meat?  No.  No, I don't think a heel would make good cock meat.  A little rough.  Do they really take it from the legs?  Yeah, I'm pretty sure they take it from soft areas like the inner thigh.  Why not the belly?  Thing.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't want to have a belly all fucked up.  Chaz wants a hug.  All right.  Fair enough.  She does want a hug.  Yeah.  Okay.  Chaz wants a dick.  You're going to dump. 
[01:18:00]  So there you go.  I'll be watching that Dancing with the Stars.  It's obviously a publicity type stunt that they're running here.  Yeah?  Isn't the Tot Mom woman there, what's her name?  Nancy Grace?  Is she the one?  Tot Mom.  She's going to be dancing too?  Tot Mom.  Is she going to have a little baby coffin as her dancing partner?  That's fucking ghoul.  She really is.  She sucks.  She does suck.  A ghoulish woman.  She does suck.  Loves dead kids.  I can't stand that fucking Frankenberry looking bitch. 
[01:18:30]  I hate her.  Tot Mom.  Wow.  Way to fucking sensationalize the lady that was accused of killing her baby.  She was trying so fucking hard to make that a phrase that stuck.  Yeah.  And make it her catchphrase for the Casey Anthony trial, and it never caught on.  Tot Mom.  Why do you need to call Tot Mom?  Why not just say her name is Casey Anthony?  Yeah.  Why?  Why do you have to fucking, oh, tabloid it up?  Yeah. 
[01:19:00]  We'll have more of Tot Mom in court this afternoon, and find out what Tot Mom is the...  Stop.  Labels and catchphrases work.  Well, that one didn't.  That one bombed.  For her?  Stunk.  What the fuck is that?  Who is that?  Who is that?  What happened?  Who is that?  What happened?  It looks like someone threw a Mr. Potato Head against the wall.  J.R. Martinez, Soap's real-life hero, an Iraq War veteran, motivational speaker, and actor  on ABC's All My Children. 
[01:19:30]  Why is he on our screen?  Because he'll be on Dancing with the Stars.  Oh, what's the lineup?  We got some celebrities this time around?  Well, it's...  We never really get celebrities.  Carson Kressley from Straight Eye for the...  I mean, whatever.  Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.  What if we say queer, we're in trouble.  Was he recently in a bathroom on a jetliner?  No?  Exactly.  He's been doing a lot of relevant stuff lately.  Yeah, really.  That thing.  Chaz Bono, we know.  Chaz Bono.  Look at that double chin.  Jesus.  Lovely. 
[01:20:00]  Chyna Phillips, the pop princess.  Yes.  From Wilson Phillips, I believe?  How about we call her the one-hit wonder?  That would be accurate as well.  Of course it would be.  David Arquette.  Oh, boy.  Jesus Christ.  Great.  Elizabeth Canalis, the Italian beauty known for her...  Gorgeous figure and striking expressions.  They've truly run out of people to put on this Dancing with the Stars pogrom. 
[01:20:30]  She became instantly recognizable...  Oh, really?  ...in the world of high fashion and advertising.  Well...  They're nine seasons away from asking me.  Nine seasons.  That's not bad.  Hope Solo, soccer superstar.  Han's daughter?  That's right.  Yes, that's right.  Very good.  I'm not looking at Jimmy.  Of course.  J.R. Martinez.  Sure.  Yeah, we saw him already.  Kristen Cavalieri from the Hills.  She just doesn't care.  What an attitude.  Kevin Cavalier. 
[01:21:00]  Of course.  Nancy Grace.  Nancy Grace.  Oh, look at her.  Can you go back to John Lithgow?  Oh, I fucking...  John Lithgow.  Can everybody just fucking make fun of this monster on Twitter?  She looks like the fucking thing that gave Bugs Bunny the fucking haircut.  Did you say that already?  Yeah, she's got that same hairstyle.  What was that thing's name?  Gossamer, the monster.  Monsters are such interesting people.  And she is a monster.  She's terrible.  Ricky Lake.  Ricky Lake.  She looks thin. 
[01:21:30]  Is it fat, Ricky Lake?  She looks good.  Or thin, Ricky Lake these days?  She's in good shape.  She got back in shape?  Was it all baby fat?  Well, no, she was fat, and then...  I'm never a good fan of hers.  She doesn't have like a fucking peanut.  Gee, what a giant lower jaw she has.  Yeah.  Wait, why don't you like her?  That was for eating purposes back when she was fat.  Why don't you like her?  Steam shovel jaw.  I never liked that show she had.  The Ricky Lake show?  Yes, that Ricky Lake show.  She'd try to be confrontational, but it would always end up being completely politically correct. 
[01:22:00]  Like, she would take the side of whatever was the politically correct thing and chastise  the other people on the stage.  You know, like Nazi Party and white supremacists and things like that.  People that probably should be chastised.  Well, yeah.  Robert Kardashian.  What?  The son, Rob Kardashian.  Oh, cool.  Glad to see him get some boy.  Do you have a son?  Yeah, there's a boy.  Boy, he's pissed.  He doesn't have a vagina, huh?  And Ron Artest, a.k.a.  Meta World Peace.  That's right.  He changed his name. 
[01:22:30]  I forgot.  Meta World Peace?  How much attention do you need, Ron?  A lot.  That's his new name.  Don't call him Ron.  Why would anyone call him Meta World?  I would just call you.  Hey.  Hey, dumb slogan.  He said that.  What do you call Ron Artest?  He said he was changing his name to Meta World Peace because he wanted World Peace on his  basketball jersey for a positive message for the kids.  Didn't he beat up people?  I don't know, but he was just trying to get a positive message.  How about Ron World Peace then? 
[01:23:00]  Fucking Astro.  Yeah, yeah.  Ron World Peace.  Why is he changing it?  That's a great question.  Wish he was here to answer.  What does the Meta part mean?  Is that another language?  Yeah.  Meta.  That's it.  That wraps up the cast for this year's Dancing with the Stars.  I can't wait.  Another big show coming out, X Factor.  Oh, yeah.  They've been promoing this like crazy.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but it looks familiar.  It looks like a show I've seen. 
[01:23:30]  I can't quite figure it out.  The voice.  I guess it's Simon Cowell is on it.  And a bald black guy.  L.A. Reid.  Oh, is that it?  Antonio L.A. Reid.  And who else?  Paula Abdul.  Paula Abdul is on there, too.  Paula Abdul.  See?  And it's just, to me, I saw it and went like, wow, did I jump at a time machine?  Who else?  And Nicole from the Pussycat Dolls.  She's pretty hot.  And that guy.  Who's that guy?  I don't know who that guy is.  I love the fact they're all walking dramatically and Simon has his shades on. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, yeah.  What an asshole he looks like.  Oh, yeah.  It's going to kick America's...  American Idol's done.  This is going to be the big thing.  I don't think there's an age limit on this one, is there?  So, you know, you could be...  So you're going to get real singers?  Well, you could...  It doesn't have to be...  More seasoned?  Just kids.  And I'll tell you this.  I mean, L.A. Reid, you thought Simon pulled no punches, but L.A. Reid...  In person.  Well.  L.A. Reid is harsh. 
[01:24:30]  He's a businessman.  In person.  He's a businessman?  Oh, yes.  What does he do?  He's all business.  Where does he come from?  What's his bio?  He's a label executive.  He's a big-time record producer.  Atlantic Records.  L.A. Reid.  He discovered Usher.  Oh, did he?  Where?  That's right.  Pink.  And Usher.  And Usher.  Radio City.  Discovered.  Biebs.  So, L.A. Reid.  Discovered Biebs.  Yeah.  That's right.  This is pretty much the exact cast of American Idol. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  I mean, really.  L.A. Reid.  I went to...  Is he going to go say dog and stuff?  No.  L.A. Reid is not the nice Randy Jackson guy.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  I once went to a Jay-Z concert at Madison Square Garden, and I saw L.A. Reid sitting  by Usher, and at one point, Usher was sitting on L.A. Reid's lap at the concert.  It was a very strange thing to see.  Why would he do that?  I don't know.  I didn't ask.  They weren't near me.  That was very odd.  What's that about Sam?  I don't know.  What's going on there? 
[01:25:30]  Something fishy.  And now what?  Bieber has to sit on Usher's lap?  That's right.  Hot.  That's right.  And will Paula be drugged up?  I would think so.  Yeah.  That's part of the deal.  Because we could only hope to see a just staggering, half-falling asleep, stuttering and slurring  Paula Abdul.  Well, this doesn't look anything like American Idol, because everybody knows on American  Idol they have Coke cups in front of them.  And, obviously, here in this picture, these are Pepsi cups.  Pepsi cups.  Cool.  And Simon is all the way, if you're looking at their faces, all the way to the right. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, yeah.  Paul Abdul sitting next to him.  Then this girl, just to make it try to seem different, the fourth person.  Nicole Scherzinger.  And then L.A. Reid, who is the Randy Jackson, all the way on the left.  I hate his name.  So they couldn't even mix up, you know, like L.A. Reid.  I hate names.  Antonio L.A. Reid.  L.A. Reid.  Well, I guess he's from L.A.  That's a perfect name.  I like him.  It's good to make.  Oof.  What do you mean Mariah Carey, too? 
[01:26:30]  Well, she's a mentor on one episode.  A mentor.  God bless her.  Yeah.  I mean, Rihanna's going to be a mentor.  They are going to have mentors, like American Idol does.  Ryo, Ryo, Ryo.  I've had it.  Why do you think Simon left American Idol to do this?  I don't understand it.  Because he got tons more money to this, because he created this show.  Oh, yes.  Simon Fuller created the other one.  His show, and he knows it's going to be huge, because people are getting a little tired  with American Idol.  Well, he's, I mean, he's a smart guy. 
[01:27:00]  He knew American Idol was just about done with its run, although it had a great year,  obviously.  But, I mean.  American Idol will survive.  No problem.  It's going to survive with the X Factor?  Because they're not competing.  They're both on Fox.  It doesn't matter.  When does X Factor start?  After American Idol.  No, when?  I don't know.  Isn't it starting soon?  Anne just said.  It can only take so much.  Is it a fall show?  I don't know when it premieres.  Well, I know the premiere of, like, September 21st.  Yeah, yeah.  So, it'll probably, the finale will come, and then American Idol will start. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Fair enough.  So, I guess they'll both survive.  But some people might not be able to take all that bullshit.  No way.  Once Seacrest comes out there.  Well, because you also got The Voice competing in that arena.  Fuck The Voice.  Who's the host, by the way?  The Voice.  Who's the host of X Factor?  Maybe that guy is the host.  I think it's, I mean, Simon Cowell is the draw here.  But I guess that guy.  What guy?  Bill Tepley?  Is that radio guy?  Bill Tepley.  I don't think it's Bill.  But see, like, on the homepage.  See this guy?  He's not one of the judges.  Who is he? 
[01:28:00]  He's Ryan Seacrest.  He's the Ryan Seacrest guy.  But he's scowling.  Ryan Seacrest has never scowled a day in his life.  Oh, my God.  Can we get a bio on that guy?  Yeah, I gotta find out who he is.  Gotta know who he is.  Let's see if, Simon Cowell, L.A. Reid.  Here we go.  We're gonna get Nicole Serzinger.  Paula Abdul.  And back to Simon Cowell.  Who's the guy?  Gotta know who this fucking guy is.  He was just there on photo shoot day and just jumped in there.  Judges, news, photos.  This doesn't tell us who he is.  There he is again.  There he is again. 
[01:28:30]  He's walking.  Oh, do they get a name?  A name.  Let me see.  Reed Moore.  What's his name?  No, I just clicked the thing.  His name is Reed Moore?  Reed Moore.  Reed Moore.  Oh, we have to Reed Moore.  That's right.  Oh, I thought that was his name.  Yeah, I thought that was his name.  L.A. Reid and Reed Moore.  That would sound pretty cool, actually.  They don't even have his name there.  They have, look.  No, it's Paul Abdul, L.A. Reid, Simon Cowell, Nicole...  Scherzinger.  Scherzinger.  And then his name is Premier, I guess.  Oh, his name's Premier?  Okay.  Now again. 
[01:29:00]  Click on Premier so we can learn more about him.  There's nothing...  Who's the fucking host?  Who's that guy?  Wow, they don't...  Boy, they want to tuck him away.  Maybe they're not happy with him.  They wouldn't be showing a picture of him then.  Let me see.  Steve Jones.  Steve Jones.  Look him up.  From the Sex Pistols?  See what he's done.  There he is.  The X-Factor hosts Steve Jones to host Emmy pre-show.  What?  X-Factor.  So they're putting him out there.  I'm sure there's a tie-in there somewhere.  What has he done? 
[01:29:30]  Let's see.  Let me...  Toothy.  IMDB this guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That article points out that while we don't know Steve Jones, we didn't know much about  Seacrest before Idol.  Do you think he's going to have a thing like, Jones gone?  I hope so.  Yeah, I do too.  That's what made Seacrest.  That would be nice, right?  Yeah, some kind of catchphrase.  He was an actor in Angus Thongs and Perfect Snogging and The Trevor Ending Story.  I guess he's like a comedian guy.  Those sound like porno movies.  He's from England. 
[01:30:00]  What?  Oh.  From Wales.  Boo!  So he's going to come out...  Welcome to the X Factor.  That's two accents, though.  It's going to be wonderful.  Oh, oh.  Fantastic.  Fantastic.  This is not good.  Simon Cowell already has an accent.  Oh, no.  This guy's accent would be a little...  Brilliant.  Oh, that was brilliant.  Well, Simon, it looks like you forgot to pay your room service bill.  Ah-ha.  Shut up, you fucking wanker.  Back and forth.  Yeah.  He'll be the one that gives Simon the business. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, yeah.  Well, it looks like somebody's sweater got wrinkled.  Oh, it's getting crazy.  A bunch of maniacs.  Wouldn't it be funny if it was just really mean slams?  Oh, it would be great.  Who was that pig you were fucking?  It was just quiet.  All uncomfortable.  All right.  Good for X Factor.  We'll have to look at that.  Yes.  Hobby watch.  Yes.  And we should wrap up our pop culture break with Kate Gosselin.  What's going on with Kate Gosselin?  Nothing. 
[01:31:00]  Is the show being canceled?  Yep.  Yeah, that's it, huh?  What are the kids now, 30?  Well, they went from 10 million viewers to 1.6.  Wow.  People are done with Kate Gosselin.  Was it because she was such a bitch, you think, to her husband, or because he was cheating  or whatever happened?  Probably no balancing out of her and the hubby.  It was just her.  It's like, who gives a shit about her and her dumb kids?  If you want to know the answer, I got it.  Oh, let her rip.  I think what happened, she prettied herself up too much.  Oh, look.  She's gussied up.  She's all gussied up.  So the regular high-proud moms didn't want to see that shit anymore. 
[01:31:30]  Show a picture of what she looked like when that damn show started.  No, that's her all gussied up and looking like Hollywood.  She didn't want to see her anymore because she fucking polished herself up too much.  Oh, wow.  Is that first one her?  Yeah, that's her.  Not that one.  Not that one.  Jesus.  Her book was amazing.  Here we go.  Multiple Blessings was a big hit.  Blessings.  Blessings is always a big hit.  Here we go.  What are you doing, Sam?  You're breaking it.  Sam.  No, no, no.  Now you're just on Kate Gosling.  You've got to get that. 
[01:32:00]  Now that first one.  First one.  Yeah, yeah.  That's good.  That's good.  This is why.  Let's get a full-size image.  Oh, boy.  Close the X hat.  It'll open.  Oh, boy.  That's good enough.  When people started watching this Kate Plus 8 or whatever, Johnny Cade or whatever, she  looked like that on the left.  Let me tell you something.  Horrible, mousy, brownish hair, right?  Frumpy, out of shape.  And then look at the one on the right.  Dude, there have been people that are on the lam that have not changed their appearance  that much.  Yeah.  Sure.  She could absolutely be featured on America's Most Wanted on the left, and then you would 
[01:32:30]  never recognize it from the right.  She's too pretty now.  It's like, I want to see the body without a thing, because you know that's a fucking  disaster.  It's not.  No?  No.  It's got to be.  Eight kids?  Get a bikini pic.  Considering she gave birth to eight kids, they showed her in bikinis, and honestly, it's  not bad.  Let's see.  I said not bad, by the way.  Don't want to fucking attack me.  Her pussy probably has fucking bats roosting in it.  I see distance shots, and I'm seeing some... 
[01:33:00]  That's not bad, dude.  That's not bad, because since you had eight kids...  It's weird.  There's something going on in that lower abdominal region that really needs some assistance.  Probably a little tummy tuck.  I'm packing like five right now, though.  Of course.  Yeah.  But that's why the show...  She must have a tit lift, right?  She had some fucking lipo.  All that shit.  Yeah.  She got some shit done.  Yeah, the bikini shots aren't bad at all.  That's not bad for fucking eight kids.  Not bad at all.  I wouldn't mind going over there and blah, blah, blah.  For having what amounts to a litter of puppies.  She had a baseball team.  But she fucked up her own gig, man. 
[01:33:30]  She polished herself up too much, and now people don't want to see that shit.  Yeah.  They kind of want to see the regular woman.  The slob.  Yeah, a little frump.  She needed to keep a little frump in there, and the ratings would have stayed up.  They liked the average couple.  They were just a regular couple struggling to make ends meet.  Nobody wants to see a fucking attractive blonde with great tits and fucking eight annoyances.  Right.  Yeah.  She got rid of John.  And then, yeah.  Hey, John.  And now she portrays herself as having this privileged life because of this show, and people are like,  well, that's not why I was watching it in the first place. 
[01:34:00]  Nobody wants to see you going to parties.  Start fucking people.  Start fucking book signings and all that shit.  Look at what she looks like.  Whatever.  You know what?  Yeah, that doesn't look bad, but that vagina's got to look like fucking Wren's mouth from  Wren and Stimpy.  Your card hung there.  It really does.  Like a bugle.  Like a flesh bugle.  So, she goes away.  I think the final episode is this week or something.  What is she calling it out?  Kate Plus Eight?  I think so. 
[01:34:30]  I didn't watch.  Is a million viewers bad though on Kate?  1.6.  When it goes from 10 to 1.6, I believe that would be.  What do you think it was?  She annoyed people?  She should have got a new boyfriend.  No, I'm telling you.  She polished herself up too much.  Wait a minute.  Look at that.  All right, that's fucking airbrushed like crazy on People Magazine.  My new body.  Who wants to see that?  That's what I'm saying, man.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, they erase shit.  You know that.  You've seen that on TV.  Unless it's from Undertaker's Gazette.  My new body. 
[01:35:00]  Is there a magazine called Undertaker's Gazette?  No, but there should be.  Where's that ass at?  Go up, up, up, up, up.  Up, up, right there.  Let's see her ass.  It's not fucking bad.  That's not bad.  That's a nice little fucking cheek hanging out.  That's a mama.  Cheeks hanging out.  Keep her to eight kids.  That dumb turtle face though.  Oh, I know.  She looks horrible.  Her fucking profile.  You know how many times her hemorrhoids just fucking hung down like melting mozzarella?  Just sitting there fucking because she's pregnant again. 
[01:35:30]  You want to know the real reason why the show's going away?  Why is that?  Nick in North Carolina's got it.  Oh.  Yeah.  I believe, guys, that the reason the show's going away is because Kate no longer has John  to be a cunt to.  And I think all the women out there really love the way she abused this man because the  women that like this show are nothing but fiction.  Yeah.  All right.  There you go.  Yeah.  I guess a lot of women enjoyed, you know, Kate giving John the business. 
[01:36:00]  There's a picture of her in a bikini real close up.  She's sitting and kind of leaning forward and her belly looks like someone used the smudge  tool on Photoshop.  She really does not look good.  Yeah.  Someone's saying go to Kate Gosling's Twitter if you want to be annoyed.  Oh, yeah.  What is it?  That real fast.  Woke up today, thought cuntly ideas, took care of my brood.  Exactly.  Saw a little plane flying over my vagina.  See, because it's big.  There's mule rides going into it. 
[01:36:30]  50,000 followers?  How do you even show it?  Almost 10 million people.  Yeah.  Read some of her tweets that will annoy us.  FYI, we'll go through kids, huh?  We'll go through kids CL hopefully next week.  What is Rory's main...  What's that?  May need?  Oh, what is Rory's may need?  Jeans, shirts, dresses, et cetera?  May need.  Oh, may need.  Uh, would like to give you what you need most shoes. 
[01:37:00]  What?  GM, good morning, all.  I'm waiting.  I'm waiting my Today Show interview.  I'm announcing an exciting surprise.  Don't miss it.  Oh, I wonder what that was.  I don't know.  Hope was a good hanging.  Wait, that's still two minutes ago.  She's on GM, good morning, America, today?  Today Show.  GM, all.  Good morning.  GM is...  Good night.  Good morning.  Or, um...  Or get someone who she's ready to have sex.  She likes a certain type of person.  Yeah, and when she wants her boyfriend, she'll tell somebody to get... 
[01:37:30]  And they break him in.  GM.  Yeah, whatever, so...  I'm all ready for bed, ready for my early a.m. tomorrow.  Tome will be smiling at you all as I talk about K Plus 8 and its amazing six-year-run  today's show, Williams and others.  Too many abbreviations, you see?  Are awful.  She can't figure out Twitter.  She's too dumb to figure out how to abbreviate things.  She tweets like a black person.  The criteria. 
[01:38:00]  All the black people do that.  I have no idea what they're saying.  The blacks are taking over Twitter.  No.  Yeah, they are, eh.  There's enough room for everyone.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  It's just like society.  Society.  Sometimes you get a flash mob of tweets come through, but they're gone in a minute or two.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No harm, no harm.  By the way, Penn is coming in Wednesday.  I'm gone.  Can somebody just tell him that I...  He mentioned me on one of his podcasts saying I was making fun of the...  He didn't attack me, but he said I was making fun of the Comic-Con people.  Oh, you were.  But I really wasn't. 
[01:38:30]  No, I remember you were.  No, I wasn't.  Believe me.  If I was going to make fun of the Comic-Con people, it would have been brutal.  I'm teasing.  Maybe you saw Chip making fun of the Comic-Con people.  That's probably it.  But Chip wasn't even.  Chip's just an ass.  Well, what's the problem if you do make fun of it?  That is true.  What is the problem?  I don't know.  What would be the problem there, Penn?  There wouldn't be one.  We're going to have to ask him.  Chip did say that somebody looked like an abortion doctor.  Well, they looked like an abortion doctor.  Chip's thing, though, is he said there was a Tonight Show bit, and it wasn't.  That was something...  Chip makes fun of...  It's just fucking... 
[01:39:00]  If they were UFC fans, Chip would have done the same dumb jokes.  Right.  That wasn't a case of, hey, let's go there and target these nerds.  It was a matter of Chip as an unfunny guy and makes fun of everything and is unfunny when  he does it.  That's the bit of Chip.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm explaining Chip.  Everybody knows that.  And Chip was going to riff because there were so many interesting people there, and he  riffed horribly.  I thought he was all right.  What, do you get bananas on your head?  He did it over and over.  It's terrible.  Remind somebody.  We'll ask him, Chip.  Yeah, because I'll be...  I'm in L.A. Wednesday.  Yeah, because who cares if you made fun of the Comic-Con? 
[01:39:30]  Well, he said that he wouldn't make fun of them, but it's almost like, come on,  man, if religion is fair game and everything else is fair game, somebody who shows up at  a fucking public place dressed like Captain America is fair game.  There's a lot to make fun of.  Yeah.  As long as you don't target them and think that you're better than they are and they're  just shit.  I mean, but come on.  They're no different than any other group of people.  They're make fun of them like every other group.  Let's go to Heath in Arizona.  Oh, I'm so sorry.  You are a wonderful joke.  Oh, go ahead.  Heath?  Back to the Kate Gosselin thing, guys. 
[01:40:00]  I hate to reiterate, but you know, Kate's going to be in financial doldrums after this.  I can see the Playboy shooting her future, can't y'all?  Yeah.  Well, what is she going to do next, man?  I think she's covering up.  Do you think she's going to playboy?  She's covering up some bad shit with whatever that bikini does cover up.  They'll airbrush it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They'll airbrush everything.  Yeah.  Just show her asshole open.  I love that we still use airbrush.  It's a guy with a Photoshop, but whatever it is, fix it, retouch. 
[01:40:30]  And Rob in Florida reminds us that L.A. Reid's kid was on Super Sweet 16.  That's right.  Oh, really?  I think it was one of the best episodes, too.  Oh, God.  Let me go to Rob really fast.  Those spoiled fucking kids that they've done gets his car.  I think that was one of the better ones ever.  They're all great.  That's showing away, right?  Because they're all just snotty fucking pieces of shit. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, whatever.  Snotty pieces of shit.  They really are.  Did you...  Is that guy 16, or is that L.A. Reid?  Robert.  Yeah.  Did Usher perform?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  At my 16th birthday party.  There's nothing going on there.  It's my birthday.  What was Usher's big song?  I don't know who he is, but I don't know one song he does.  He said, yeah, was a humongous song. 
[01:41:30]  How's that go?  Most recently.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But he had a whole confession in this part, too.  It was a follow-up, no.  Possibly is coming out in April.  We'll see.  There's a big summer release.  That's all he does?  Yeah.  This is Usher.  I think it's a little John.  No, a little John produced.  Featuring a little John.  Featuring.  You can't have a song without a featuring.  This was massive.  Yeah. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, in the club with the homies.  Shut the fuck up.  I didn't know this was Usher.  What's wrong with the club with the homies?  I hate the club.  Why not?  It's fun.  What's wrong with the club with the homies?  Get out of the club.  Where else are you going to chill with your homies at?  Yeah, man.  What's going on with you?  Because tell me, let me tell you, when the club is closing, there's going to be problems  out front.  We all know it.  He was sharing a club with his homies.  It was about the diner.  They were having a sandwich.  Oh, I thought you meant something else.  No, it was his favorite crackers.  He's a big club cracker. 
[01:42:30]  And just don't rent near the club and you'll be all right.  I know.  I just hate it.  Oh, sorry.  The song's about the club.  Duck club.  Enough with your club.  You want to hear more lyrics?  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's no lyrics. 
[01:43:00]  A lot of yes.  That's why it's called Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll see.  We'll see.  His Confessions album sold over 10 million copies.  Jesus.  What was the song from Confessions?  This was on it.  My Boo was on it featuring Alicia Keys.  You guys know my boo?  I certainly don't.  Put on my boo.  I love that song.  That's like a more like love song.  They left a couple of letters off of that.  Oh, Jake. 
[01:43:30]  See, he's got a sensitive side, too.  That's what people don't understand.  Is he a rapper?  No, he's a singer.  Oh, he is.  Okay.  My Boo.  Is that on the song?  My Boo.  Yeah, well, I agree with the second half of the title.  Boo.  Alicia Keys is on the track.  I don't mind this, but I hate the name My Boo.  Why is every song ruined with some of that talking shit? 
[01:44:00]  See, this is all right.  This is all right.  I don't like R&B, but a little R&B.  My Boo.  My Boo.  My Boo.  Stop singing it like that.  My Boo.  That's not it.  My Boo.  You're my Boo.  I've got a Boo, and it's you.  You're my Boo.  That's not the word.  You're my Boo.  Boo!  Want to have a Boo.  Boo!  Like you, you're my Boo.  No. 
[01:44:30]  Stop it!  Would you be my Boo?  Thanks a million.  Stop whining.  Quiet.  Cockmeat.  Nothing but cockmeat.  All right.  Exactly.  I have fucking heard it.  I actually, I want to sing this to Voss.  You're my Jew.  My Jew.  My Jew.  It's a good-ass album. 
[01:45:00]  It's an all right album.  I play that when my accountant walks in.  My Jew.  Or my Boo, if it's taxing.  I give him one of these.  Boo!  Boo!  Ah-ha-boo.  Is 10 million a lot?  Where does that rank?  10 million is huge now.  But where's that rank?  I mean, I don't know.  The ranking's all off because, like, now 10 million is a lot, but before it wasn't as much  because digital downloading wasn't.  Oh, digital download now.  Taking over.  A lot of people still stealing music?  What's going on?  Oh, yeah.  It's harder, though.  Is it?  It is a little more difficult, but especially in the community, people steal music. 
[01:45:30]  Well, just work for a radio station, man.  What community are you talking about?  I haven't paid for a fucking song in decades.  Confessions Part 2 was another giant song off that album.  Are they both in the same one?  Yeah.  Yeah, I was on there.  My Boo.  How does Confessions Part 2 go?  Good question.  Like, oh, this is what I did again.  Yeah.  Confessions Part 2.  I've got a secret, and I'm going to tell you.  It's not the song.  Oh, I've got a secret, and I'm going to tell you.  That's how it goes. 
[01:46:00]  Two.  I'll try this.  This is what I know you haven't.  Yeah, see, the album came out just as he was breaking up with one of the TLC ladies.  And this song is about a man who had a baby with a woman on the side,  so everybody thought Usher had impregnated a woman while seeing Chili.  Left eye?  Was it left eye?  No.  He's not going to fuck around with them crazy bitches.  He was seeing Chili.  Well, those people do that.  What's those people? 
[01:46:30]  Why'd they change the word people do that a lot?  It's not subtle at all.  They shouldn't have changed the words.  I like the original version.  Had the original going.  Oh, I've got a secret, and I'm going to tell you.  Never heard that version.  That's the original.  You forgot the Part 2 part.  Part 2.  All right, when we get back, I guess we got Tyra Banks coming in today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who saw that coming?  Panty party bitches.  Oh, God.  I forgot about that.  Does she even know who we are?  She's about to find out.  We beat the shit out of her.  She's fitting to find out.  She's promoting a book. 
[01:47:00]  We beat the shit out of her for years, and she's coming on our show.  The fact that she read one.  Why didn't we get the book, by the way?  Those people don't read.  It's not subtle and charming.  It's a pamphlet.  Why didn't we get the book, though?  Maybe there's a good reveal in there or something.  The book is called Model Land.  It's a young fantasy adventure novel inspired by Tyra's experience growing up in the modeling business.  I'm assuming it's in the YA section.  Young adult.  Yes, you are.  Young adult.  Roland just said because it was booked so late on Friday, we wouldn't have gotten them in time late in the game. 
[01:47:30]  All right.  Fair enough.  Those people are always late.  Enough with this over-the-top racism.  Hey, Ann, when we get back, we got some terrific audio from somebody on staff that we're going to have to play.  From someone on staff?  That we're going to have to play.  I'm in.  Some terrific audio.  Is it really good?  This is going to be the best hour of the show today.  Oh, no.  That's not saying much.  True, true, true.  The bar's not that high today. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, it's easy to crawl over it.  I'll tell you what the best hour of every show is.  The 10 o'clock.  Yes.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  I appreciate you.  Can you isolate that for me?  Sure.  Thank you very much, Ann.  I appreciate it.  If we could just go to break now, that would be great.  Sirius XM.  The Virus.  Cause he can call a tranny when he's hedging all alone. 
[01:48:30]  And a...  Little Yimmy got him good boy phone, so he can book a gig with Jay Leno  And Little Yimmy got him not a boy phone, so he can call a tranny when he's edging all alone  And Anthony has got him good boy phone, so he can get a call from tranny early in the morning  Anthony him got his not a boy phone, you never know Casey Anthony could try to call him a good boy phone  And him not a boy phone, not a boy phone, and him good boy phone 
[01:49:00]  And good boy phone, and him not a boy phone, not a boy phone, and him good boy phone  Anthony him got him not a boy phone, Little Yimmy got him not a boy phone  Opie Hughes only got one phone, him the only one not a creep on the show  It's a good boy phone, and him not a boy phone, not a boy phone, and him good boy phone  And him good boy phone, and him good boy phone, and him not a boy phone 
[01:49:30]  The Virus Series XM.  This is the Open Entry Show.  Why?  He says, huh?  You like the Black Crowes, eh?  Nope.  Never been a fan.  Really?  Never been a fan of the Black Crowes.  What's the singer of his name?  Adam?  Adam Duritz? 
[01:50:00]  Yes.  I know a woman who's dying to fuck his brains out.  This is Chris Robinson.  Chris Robinson.  Oh, Counting Crows, okay.  This is too, like, the Crows were too, like, bluesy, kind of, that influenced, I'm not a big fan.  Flying around and stuff, right, Ed?  No.  I like the bluesy stuff.  Yeah, I know.  And I like the bluesy influence with this band.  Yeah, I don't.  No?  No, not at all.  Even their version of Hard to Handle Now. 
[01:50:30]  I hated it.  That fucking song was good, man.  I hated that.  I don't like that Rem-a-D.  You don't like Rem-a-D?  Rem-a-D.  No one says it like that.  Shut up.  Ugh.  Him with his hippie look.  Put some shoes on.  I had to take a hop.  I'm a bitter person.  I'm such a bitter person.  You kind of are.  I was yelling.  You kind of are.  I'm constantly yelling.  You kind of are.  I'm an asshole.  I love the Black Crows, too. 
[01:51:00]  I really do.  Don't like them, huh?  No.  No?  No.  Not really.  Not a fan.  Why would you have two bands?  One, the Black Crows, and one, the Counting Crows?  Wouldn't the second one go, look, Crows is already in a name?  Yeah.  Who was first?  I would say Black Crows.  But then why would the Counting Crows go with that?  Why wouldn't they just go, this Black Crow?  You know what was worse?  Alice in Chains, Jesus Mary Chains, Jesus Jones.  There was, I think there was another one thrown in there, too, that just got to the, 
[01:51:30]  especially when they were all pretty much at the same time, and they were new.  You were like, who is this?  What?  Jesus Mary Alice in Chains Jones?  Who the fuck is playing this song?  You know, if there's another name, I mean, did you,  I don't know if you guys remember the band, in 1974, there was a great band,  the singer's name was Roger Sabbath.  You got too excited.  I know I did.  He got so excited, didn't he?  I just let him go with it, but I'm like, Jimmy.  Roger Sabbath.  You're getting worse.  You're getting worse.  Okay. 
[01:52:00]  I want your top five bands.  Top five bands?  I'm trying to figure out your music taste.  I always thought I knew it.  I know it's, Alice in Chains is in there.  Yeah, Alice in Chains is in there.  Who?  I know you're not a big Stones guy.  Who, maybe?  No, I do.  I do.  I do like the Who.  Beatles?  Who?  No, I wouldn't go Beatles.  That's kind of like, I enjoy the Beatles, but.  Let's not make it hard.  It doesn't have to be the top five, but like five that you really.  Kiss?  Really like.  Yeah, I'm trying to think.  Sabbath?  Some of the other stuff. 
[01:52:30]  Zeppelin?  B-52s?  He doesn't like Zeppelin, really.  No, I'm not a big Zeppelin fan.  He's not a U-T-Hine fan.  Gregory Hines is tap dancing.  And you know what the odd thing is, and here it is, even growing up, music was never that  big an influence on my life.  I never really.  Yeah, but you know a lot of the, because it's moments with you.  Yeah.  You know a lot of old songs that your parents were playing in the car and shit.  Yeah, shit like that.  I don't know.  But you didn't grow up with music yourself?  No, I don't think I ever literally sat down and listened. 
[01:53:00]  I might have liked, you know, the first Van Halen album that came out, throw the headphones  on, and blasted that for a while.  I liked Bad Company when I was growing up and shit.  You weren't here for the famous Unchained discussion.  Were you a big Unchained fan?  I hated when that happened.  Lincoln.  Oh.  Oh.  See, I thought, again, I misunderstand so much on this show.  No, I wasn't. 
[01:53:30]  Those people used to be in chains, Sam.  Jesus.  You're very fast-thinking racist.  Very funny.  You weren't here for the Unchained discussion, which a lot of people would agree is the greatest  Van Halen song.  What is your favorite Van Halen song?  Oh, that's right.  I listened to that, though.  Me and the Jay Moores.  It was Jay Moores, and then what, Florentine?  Wasn't...  No, what happened was stupid Eddie Trunk, and we love this guy.  We really do.  Yes.  But he was getting a little too cool with his fucking list on every band, and he didn't 
[01:54:00]  have Unchained on there.  How does Unchained go?  I just don't know how it goes.  Unchained is pretty goddamn good.  Is this your best Zeppelin, your favorite Led Zeppelin song?  Favorite Zeppelin song?  You know what?  I like fucking Dancing Days.  I just...  How does that go?  Is that Dancing Days?  No.  Dancing Days?  Whatever it is.  No, I'm...  Whatever they call it.  Dancing Idaway?  Yeah, that song. 
[01:54:30]  No, I'm talking about...  Did I say Zeppelin?  I meant Van Halen.  Oh, okay.  Oh, Jesus.  I thought...  Fuck me.  What's Unchained?  Fuck me running.  No, I meant...  What's your favorite Van Halen song?  Dancing Queen by ABBA.  What?  This is a good Zeppelin song.  Yeah, that's good.  Sorry, I fucked up.  Yeah, I like this.  Oh, God, no.  There's some...  You don't like this one?  I'm not in love with it, but...  Panama's better.  I gotta listen to it.  This is okay.  Panama's much better than this. 
[01:55:00]  Better beat.  Nah, this is alright right here.  I just scream it.  Who said that?  Who are you?  Who said that?  Who are you?  It's me.  Who are you?  Pretty girl.  Drink a straw.  Have margarita.  Yeah, pretty girl.  Jimmy Lee Roth.  He just fucked up a great song for me.  That's every fucking one of his songs.  Pretty girl.  Hey, hey, mama. 
[01:55:30]  What are you doing?  Yeah.  You like Everybody Wants Some?  Yeah, that's a cool song.  I like that one.  That's a good one.  You're just fun.  It's been hailing for me.  Give us something to ride on, man.  Yeah.  Motorbike.  Pretty girl.  Ice cream, little girl.  Shut up.  That's really big.  I love it. 
[01:56:00]  Fucking Jimmy.  Fucking Jimmy.  All right, so we got Van Halen.  We got The Who.  We got, what was the other band that Ann said?  Alice in Chains.  Alice in Chains.  Peter Frampton he loves.  The Who.  Obviously, you don't like Sammy Hagar or Van Halen.  No.  No.  He did pull it off, though.  Let's be honest with you.  I'm trying to fucking think.  I like Chicken Foot.  You don't.  Turkey Foot, of course. 
[01:56:30]  We're not going to get two more bands from you.  Yeah, you will.  Come on.  You like Sammy?  Very difficult.  I'm trying to remember.  I like him, but I wouldn't put him in like my favorite.  Believe me, I like him a lot.  Neil Diamond?  No.  No.  Yeah, it could be a little gay.  Just saying.  Gay?  All right.  That was going to be gay.  It could be kind of more of a pussy band.  Yeah, that's okay.  What I would put on.  The Pogues?  As far as.  Yeah, the Pogues.  Look at Curry Collins on the sideline. 
[01:57:00]  We did it earlier, but that guy has no business fucking out with football.  He's got a Hitler mustache, too.  Well, no.  I think it's just that the mustache is going gray, but the middle is still dark.  Oh, the middle is still dark.  Is that it?  Surprised he's got a star in his helmet, fumbling like that.  Fucking cunt.  No, I can't think of any other bands.  Yeah, it's obvious you didn't really grow up.  All right, all right.  You're right.  You're right.  I kind of do like, I did like fucking live.  Sha Na Na?  Live. 
[01:57:30]  You really?  I hated those fucking guys.  I liked Live.  Live?  I liked Disturbed.  Yeah, Disturbed was all right.  Disturbed.  Why did you like Live?  I don't know.  Just kind of liked it.  Which one of their songs?  The placenta hits the floor.  I wasn't a big fan of that one.  What live songs do you like?  That was okay.  No.  I liked I Alone.  Oh, you know what?  That's a fucking good song, man.  I like Corrosion of Conformity.  I liked them.  C.O.C. Rule.  C.O.C. 
[01:58:00]  I like Rob Zombie.  Yes.  Like fucking Living Dead Girl is fucking great and shit like that.  Mm-hmm.  What about Priest?  I don't know.  Nah, Priest is too...  I actually, you know what?  If you want to go a little, like, 80s kind of fruity and stuff, I didn't.  I wasn't.  Let's go into the bathroom.  I did like Def Leppard during the day.  You didn't like Def Leppard, Jimmy?  Come on.  No. 
[01:58:30]  Pour some sugar on me.  Exactly.  I don't like that.  No.  How can you?  Pour some sugar on me.  No, on me.  On me.  Fucking nonsense.  I like one...  Oh, Witch A Woman.  Bring It On The Heartache I like.  That's the only Def Leppard song I like.  Def Leppard had a lot of good songs.  Oh, I thought they were terrible.  Photograph is terrible.  Fucking, uh...  What about Rocket?  I wouldn't know it.  Rocket!  This song I like.  Pour some sugar on me. 
[01:59:00]  It stinks.  I don't know.  Why?  Everyone said meh.  Meh.  Meh.  I love this one, actually.  But the rest of their stuff is terrible.  No?  Unlistenable.  We did.  We did.  We did.  We did.  But Ant, I'm surprised you didn't say the Red Hot Chili Pepper.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I didn't like the peppers like what they became.  But early on when they were really truly funk-based and that was what they called the day, 
[01:59:30]  that was some good shit.  And what about Metallica?  Blood Sugar Sex Magic and Mother's Milk and shit like that.  That was good.  Yes, Metallica, of course.  Sure, there you go.  Of course.  Where am I going?  Of course, Metallica.  Well, now your list is too big.  Yeah, yeah.  You got a big list.  Now I would wipe Van Halen off of there.  That was your number one.  No, no, it wasn't.  Alice in Chains would probably be the number one.  Fair.  And, uh...  Yeah, that's a pretty good, you know...  You forgot David Brent? 
[02:00:00]  David Brent, I like that.  I like this video.  Fucking barefoot.  Yes.  Hey, what's Mad Dog doing up on MSNBC?  How's he looking younger?  I know.  Hopefully borrowing a brush.  This fucking stupid hairdo.  Is he fucking Einstein?  This fucking place is aging the shit out of us,  and there's fucking Mad Dog looking younger and younger.  Equals MC Squared.  I'm going to tell you a little bit about physics  and the speed of light coming up after this break.  Right away. 
[02:00:30]  You're wrong, man.  No, I like light.  Light won't escape from a black hole.  I don't care how many people call in and try to tell me.  Light isn't going to escape it.  Nothing can.  You'll never attain the speed of light.  It's impossible.  The mass of whatever you're trying to accelerate to that thing  ain't going to be able to...  It's going to keep getting greater in mass,  and you'll never be able to work up enough energy  to bring it to speed of light.  Be right back after these words.  Is that how that works?  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  It's a simple thing.  The faster something goes, the more mass it attains.  So in order to... 
[02:01:00]  Really?  Yeah.  It's just something Einstein came up with.  It gets heavier.  How did he know that?  And then when you reach a point  where you're nearing the speed of light,  it's exponential.  So the mass will get so great  that there's no amount of energy  that could push it past that speed of light threshold.  I don't believe that.  I think that's what we believe right now.  I think our knowledge of physics is going to...  I bet you the speed of light is not the fastest speed. 
[02:01:30]  That could be true.  I don't know.  Einstein says no.  A lot of other physicists say no.  Other people say it won't matter  because there are ways to literally bend space  so you can get from point A to point B  by going maybe a few yards away  from where you initially started  instead of having to take that multi-million dollar  mile light year journey.  Did you see the video of the black hole sucking up that...  Let me see if I can find it.  What?  Let me see if I can find it. 
[02:02:00]  Déjà vu.  Yeah.  Well, the way...  No.  Well, that's why I'm asking.  Personally, yeah.  All right, but nah, I don't care either way.  We'll talk to you on the break.  I'm not going to...  We'll give each other secret messages  about stuff we might want to talk about on the show.  But if you want to, feel free, brother.  Feel free.  I'm not...  No, no.  Of course.  The way Kaku explained it  when he was hiding from people  is you take a piece of paper  and that represents space.  Millions of miles. 
[02:02:30]  And then you take the two ends  and you fold them like that  and then that's the distance you cover.  See?  That's what they wormhole.  Yes.  Hi, Dr. Kaku.  He really is like a petrified Yorkie.  Yeah, I saw him on the phone.  It's the worst.  After we did that bit  and I walked by and I went high  and he just didn't even look.  He doesn't know us.  He doesn't know us.  I even yell my name and everything  and he just...  Ah.  Yes.  Ah.  You have to fold the paper  because the paper would...  Ah! 
[02:03:00]  Paper folding!  I'm sorry!  Oh, somebody drank in my family  and hit me.  Oh, I...  Oh.  What are we talking about that one?  That's why his hair is so white  just from the fear.  Yeah.  He's only 28 years old.  Yes, he's petrified.  But I don't get that bending of space.  You still got to bend space.  Yeah, well that...  I mean, I love how they explain it  and it's like a piece of paper  and you just bend it  but you still have to do that.  Well, you have to bend it  but here's the thing.  The theory of light 
[02:03:30]  and super light speed travel  has been disproved  or as much as they can  the theory says that  you can't work something up to that speed.  But there could be a power source  that could bend space  much like a magnifying glass bends light  and magnetic forces can bend  certain things in the atmosphere  and heat tends to bend light 
[02:04:00]  things like that  that may be some kind of power source  that can bend space in a certain way.  But wouldn't that change distances of things  and change...  Like, wouldn't that...  Like, if that happened  wouldn't all of a sudden say  you know, on a small level  Jupiter be closer to Neptune  or Jupiter closer to the sun  or are wormholes already there  that we wouldn't have to bend?  I don't know.  Yeah, exactly.  If I knew, boy, would I be...  I don't know why I'm asking you.  Like, well, Stephen Hawking's missed this one.  Ant, what did you come up with  while you were pouring a Guinness?  He's freshly shaven. 
[02:04:30]  He must be smarter.  Yeah.  Oh, hi!  Who are you?  Oh, where's your beard hair?  Oh, I used to get beaten a lot  by men who drank.  They would call me smarty pants  and hit me with a Schlitz bottle.  I love petrified...  Petrified Dr. Cocker.  We're all scared shitless of the universe  and he's just scared of dumb things.  Yeah, he's not scared of the universe.  No, no.  The universe petrifies people  when they think of the infinity of it  and the never-endingness 
[02:05:00]  and he just...  Ah, person!  I'm going to be fired into space nude  through the event horizon of a black hole.  I'll see you tomorrow.  What time?  Ah!  Oh, there's a person here!  Oh, who used to hit me?  They drank and hit me with Miller Lite bottles.  I was beaten.  My spine was punched.  Oh, cookie.  I would look for cookie people  because they didn't drink.  Oh, I... 
[02:05:30]  What the fuck, man?  I love how scared he is.  That's really bloody.  And they're loving Jimmy Halen, too.  Yeah, who doesn't?  Jimmy Lee Roth, excuse me.  Jimmy Lee Roth rules.  Oh, hi, hi, hi.  The doctor's here!  I brought my pencil!  Did you stop?  Event horizon!  Did you jam it in my ears?  Oh, you're talking? 
[02:06:00]  Ah, god damn.  That's fucking funny, man.  Dr. Michio.  Oh, I love him, but he's so scared.  Scaredy cat.  He's so skittish.  Just fucking...  I don't even say hi to him anymore.  He walks our neighborhood, Ant,  and he doesn't even know who we are.  Maybe he's been on our show 20 times easily.  You know when you're doing something,  let's say you're working on something  and you're very into it and very focused,  and somebody comes up and goes,  hey, and you're like, ah!  Like that?  He's probably constantly going through  stuff in his mind, physics, 
[02:06:30]  and he's just constantly working on something.  And then when you go,  uh, Dr. Kaku, ah!  He just freaks out.  I yelled from across the street.  And he just runs in the opposite direction.  No, it makes him...  Don't hurt me!  He doesn't start running,  but he starts walking a lot faster.  A little faster, yeah.  I don't know what the fuck it is with him.  Ant might be right, though.  He might be, like, literally,  he might be thinking, like,  okay, the strings vibrate,  but what is the last number of infinity?  Hi, Dr. Kaku!  The fuck throws him! 
[02:07:00]  I had it!  Yeah.  He's probably not scared,  he's just mean.  You're a dumb hunk of shit!  Yes.  I had it,  and you fucked it up again!  I was one second away  from tagging 150 years  on everyone's life.  Thank you, asshole!  Yes, did you have to call?  I acknowledge you!  I saw you!  I live in your building!  We heard you!  I'm a big fan!  Get away from me,  Baba Booey!  Well,  you want this audio?  Yeah. 
[02:07:30]  Who wouldn't?  Oh, God, yeah.  This happened on Sam's show.  What?  Sam has a show?  Which one?  You know,  it's the one that you said  was the best ever.  No, I said for me,  10 o'clock.  Ah, no reason to explain.  We'll go ahead.  It's my favorite  because I leave.  Boy, it's not like he's...  Regardless of what I put on.  Because sometimes, my friend,  it is 10-10 wins.  Well,  Iraq's got the clip.  I'll tell you what the best hour  of every show is.  10 o'clock?  Thank you!  Thank you very much!  I appreciate you.  Oh, I pulled a fucking... 
[02:08:00]  I pulled a man-cow phone call  that time.  You sure did.  STP?  I just gave him a plug.  Who?  STP, yeah, I like STP.  Yeah, yeah.  What band is that?  Oh, right.  I don't know.  Yeah, but I didn't recognize it.  I'm sure Iraq has it somewhere.  The way you said it,  I didn't quite recognize  the way you said that.  ST,  Stone...  ST...  With STP!  You forgot to bring in the tape 
[02:08:30]  about the 80s thing.  Ant.  I know, I do have that.  It's sitting right there  in my house, too.  What happened here?  Cindy Lauper.  Oops.  A little flub at the end there.  Screwing up the...  What did she say?  I think she said,  Fuck America,  fuck you, you suck.  She said clit hood.  And it was a faux pas.  Do you have that?  No, I don't.  If it's on the news,  it must be a big deal.  Remembering 9-11.  So you like STP.  Yes.  And you gotta bring in that tape. 
[02:09:00]  What is the tape again?  Yeah, yeah.  A dumb show we did?  It's a whole show we did.  It's an entire...  It's two, actually.  Two entire shows that we did.  Air checks.  Where the music...  It's the end of the music.  And us talking.  And then the beginning of the music.  And then it cuts off  and it goes to the end of the music.  And you back selling and front selling  and us talking.  And, oh, are we having a great time?  And one of them was...  What was the topic?  The topic was...  God, you know you're something.  You know you're a horrible radio show. 
[02:09:30]  When?  Oh, fuck.  80s?  Yes.  A child of the 80s.  You know you're a child of the 80s if...  And then there were a bunch of people calling in,  being recorded,  and then played back.  And at one point you go...  No, no.  Don't tell me.  I swear.  At one point you go...  Please don't.  So, child of the 80s.  Bob from fucking LOL. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, God.  The phones are screwing up.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, there he is.  And then the tape plays.  It's like, oh, God.  We weren't allowed to take live phone calls.  We weren't responsible enough to take live phone calls.  No, no, no.  We had to record everything.  What audio do you have from your show on Friday?  Obie has it.  Oh.  Here we go.  Well, let's just play this.  A couple days ago, I think.  I don't know.  Last week.  Yeah, last week, I think.  I just don't know. 
[02:10:30]  She's just so used to...  Okay, so this is Troy Kwan.  Troy Kwan.  Troy Kwan.  Troy Kwan.  Was on the after show with Sam and the gang.  How does he have an Asian last name, by the way?  Troy Kwan is here.  And Francine was in.  Yes, Francine stopped by to say hi.  She's lovely and talented.  She wasn't on the air, but she came on the after show because back behind the scenes,  she was doing her Francine thing, which some people call being a cock tease, and Troy did  not respond well to it.  I wasn't being a cock tease.  I was just rubbing my elbow on your ass. 
[02:11:00]  You got her voice down.  Oh, she is fucking...  Troy Kwan.  Or rubbing her ass on your elbow or something like that.  You like the Francine.  You're just somebody that doesn't like girls because you're gay.  That's what she was doing.  That was her argument against Troy.  Yeah.  Yeah, she sucks, man.  I'm sorry.  You know, I understand she has a history with the show, but she's just back there.  She comes in.  Yeah.  And she's rubbing her...  She's sitting on the chair rubbing her ass up against me. 
[02:11:30]  You didn't like that?  I'm not going to fuck her.  She's got a fine ass on her.  It's like, if I'm not going to fuck you, don't waste my time.  How do you know within the first two seconds that you are or aren't going to fuck a girl?  That's because I'm not going to deal with that.  What do you mean deal with what?  Trying to fuck a girl?  What, do you think she's just teasing?  Deal with the bullshit.  You like girls that just walk up to you and say, whip it out on a second time?  How often do you come across these girls?  Most guys don't mind when a girl rubs their ass.  Yeah, rubs their ass.  Rubs a little thing.  It's not that bad a thing, right?  True.  She's fresh and fruity.  You know you're going to have a good day if that happens.  What happened?  She made it very clear she's looking for a man with money. 
[02:12:00]  That's what really pissed off Troy.  She walked in and said immediately she's looking to find a new boyfriend who has money.  Hey, Eric, do you have money?  Hey, Troy, do you have money?  Well, wouldn't you say most girls are looking for that?  Yet they will fuck guys that were broke in the meantime while they're searching?  Sure, but I don't know.  I'm just not interested in playing the game with her.  Aren't you guys going to have money someday?  But what's the game?  Just sitting there and sucking her dumb ass.  She rubbed her ass on your arm.  But I hate girls like that. 
[02:12:30]  I hate girls like that.  Oh, yeah.  I like the ones that wear parkas and fucking stay within 10 weeks of my personality.  Are you going to deal with that bullshit if you're not going to fuck her?  Yeah, why not?  How do you know?  I would take an ass rubbing.  But you don't know, first of all, that you're not going to fuck her.  Secondly, yeah, what's the harm in her rubbing her ass against your arm?  And you don't want to see the new handshake.  You know what I'm saying is every guy just kisses her ass because she's cute.  Yeah.  Every guy kisses her ass.  Welcome to earth.  No, I don't want to have to kiss her ass.  You don't have to.  I don't have to.  You don't have to.  So I'm like, get the fuck out of here. 
[02:13:00]  But isn't there a difference between kissing a girl's ass and telling her to get the fuck  out of here?  I don't know.  I just hate playing into that bullshit.  He's an extremist.  He's one or the other.  He really is one or the other.  There's an A or a B.  There's no.  Can you do more Francine, please?  I don't know what this problem is because I went up to him and just rubbed my butt on  his arm and he has to be gay.  He's in the bathroom, I think, having sex with men.  That's what she was saying.  Yes, that is.  Oh, really?  Somebody was listening.  Oh, I was listening to an after show. 
[02:13:30]  So you don't like the French.  I mean, I listen.  Here's how it went down on the after show a couple days ago.  I just don't know.  So she's just so used to guys kissing her ass that I just don't even.  So not true.  I don't think.  She just walks in.  So not true.  She walks into a place.  She walked into the back room and she's like, oh, I need this.  And do you have this for me?  And blah, blah, blah.  Like, give me gifts because I'm pretty.  And I just looked at her like that.  You didn't like that.  That's your vibe, Francine?  That is not my vibe, you guys.  And you know that. 
[02:14:00]  Well, Troy.  You're used to getting what you want and you love the attention.  You love when guys kiss your ass.  She walks back there and she's like, every guy I meet wants to fuck me.  She said that.  And I looked at her and I'm like, really?  Like, you're that fucking sure of yourself?  Do you want to fuck her?  I mean, I would use her hole.  Do you know what I mean?  But that's not saying anything.  Back to the orifice thing.  Yeah.  That's not saying.  Like, I fuck plastic toys.  You do?  Oh, there it is.  And that's really sad. 
[02:14:30]  Well, I don't give a fuck.  That's sad.  I would use your hole as an opening to ejaculate it.  That's all I would get.  But that's not saying anything.  Oh, Troy is an angry man.  You got some issues.  I would use your hole to ejaculate it.  I just, I hate bitches like that.  I fucking hate dumb bitches like that.  I'm not going to kiss your stupid fucking ass for your dumb pussy.  Fuck you.  It's right around the corner.  Do you know what I mean?  Like.  Do you have an anger issue with women there, Troy?  But why would you be mad if you don't want to fuck her?  Yeah.  You get really mad about her.  Because here's why, Jim. 
[02:15:00]  She walks back.  She comes back there and she goes to Eric.  What do you, do you have anything for me?  Do you have any, do you have this?  Do you have that?  She was asking for gifts.  And then she, and I'm just like.  Well, she's poor right now.  Like, shut the fuck up.  Sometimes you have to kiss the ass, though, to get to the pussy.  Yeah, not me, dude.  You've never.  At this age?  You've never kissed a little ass at, what are you, 60?  Yeah.  34?  You've never, you've never kissed a little ass to get some pussy?  Anthony.  Anthony, at this age, I don't give a fuck.  It's right around the corner.  Milk, milk, lemonade, around the back.  Fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole.  That's right.  Out comes the Tootsie Roll.  Right, right.  I don't know, man. 
[02:15:30]  That's it.  At this age, I'm not doing that, man.  I'm not doing that much.  Out comes the chocolate choo-choo train.  That's right.  That's where the duty comes from.  What is that?  The coolio.  Kids made up the greatest shit.  Oh, yeah.  That is hilarious.  Ain't my mama pretty.  She got meatballs on her titties.  Scrambled eggs between her legs.  Ain't my mama pretty.  I've never heard that one.  My friend Sean used to always sing that.  I love that one.  I've never heard that one.  Yeah.  That's great.  Rules.  You got anger issues with women?  I just.  Where does it come from?  I just hate bitches, man. 
[02:16:00]  I really do.  You really do.  What happened that made you hate girls like this?  You're misogynistic, as they say.  I just don't want to have to kiss ass for pussy.  I really don't.  And you know what?  Honestly, I would rather go home and jerk off in the toilet than doing that bitch.  No, no, no.  You said something else in there.  You'd rather.  Do you really have sex with dolls?  That's why we're playing this.  Plastic.  Plastic.  Plastic dolls.  I had a, my old roommate used to work at an adult bookstore and he would let us just  steal whatever we wanted.  That's a nice guy.  So I would see masturbation toys and I'd be like, oh, that looks like fun. 
[02:16:30]  And then I'd go home and fuck it.  Yeah.  Would you fuck it?  Like, you know, fake.  There was a thing called the Blue Mermaid.  That was a lot of fun.  It was like this nice jelly, jelly fake pussy thing.  I mean, they have like the fleshlights, you know?  Oh, the fleshlight.  Yeah.  Yeah, I would, I would, yeah, I would fuck a fake pussy.  Wait, you know what?  I thought it was those old school fucking dolls that look ridiculous.  With their mouth like, oh, he's yelling at the doll.  I'm not going to kiss your plastic fucking ass just to stick it in your fucking hole and 
[02:17:00]  shut your mouth.  It looks stupid.  It looks like you're going, oh.  What was your favorite thing you had sex with from that store?  It's probably the Blue Mermaid.  That was nice.  It's like a real nice jelly.  Sam, look up the Blue Mermaid.  What are you doing?  Okay.  Love that one.  Enough with this city law.  Under the sea.  But they had all this crazy stuff.  Stick it in her sea.  The girl's a laugh at that one.  They had this thing called the Electro Handjob.  And you had like a.  Electro Handjob?  There it is.  Great.  You had sex with that?  Yeah.  Oh, it looks like you're actually having sex with a mermaid. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, it's got the pussy lips.  Wow, that's great.  Who'd you hang out with?  Fucking Warren from 10 to Midnight.  You know what?  That's for checking off.  Checking off.  Did you at least build a woman around that?  Because there's nothing going on there.  It's just a little sleeve, really.  Yeah.  That's a strictly.  I mean, it's all you need.  That's strictly quick fucking.  Yeah.  Just get it over with.  That's like you say, an orifice.  Yeah, it's just an opening.  So do you date?  Yeah, I'm actually dating somebody right now.  Okay.  She's great.  You date a girl.  Yeah.  Now, when you go out on a... 
[02:18:00]  You're dating a girl now, though, but this is different.  When you go out on a first date with a girl, are you constantly looking to see if she's  trying in some way fuck you over?  No.  Before you...  Will you tell her right off the bat, like, look, I'm just looking to fuck you?  Not in so many words, but...  Because anything else is considered ass-kissing.  A compliment, a nice dinner.  That's kissing a girl's ass, in your terms.  There's a difference between kissing ass and just going out and being playful and having 
[02:18:30]  fun.  Well, that's what she was saying.  I think that's what she was saying.  She was doing was just being a little playful.  Yeah, I wouldn't interpret it as that.  Touching on the arm of your chair, touching her ass onto the arm of your chair.  If I met a girl and she was like, what's in this for me?  What am I going to get out of this?  And that vocal about it?  Yeah.  I would never date anybody like that.  She's honest, though, at least.  All women think that.  And I'm honest.  All women think that.  Yeah, but she also thought Troy might be bi-curious, at least, like, bisexual.  Yeah.  She thought there was something in him that liked guys.  I don't know if that's true at all. 
[02:19:00]  Well, you did get in bed with Ian Halpern.  Yeah, I did.  And they were naked.  There was a naked thing going on there.  Wow.  And that was weird.  What was your suggestion?  Yeah, it was.  And I was going to get naked, and he didn't want me to get naked.  Yeah, that's true.  That is actually a true story.  Ian Halpern asked Troy to keep his underwear on, because Troy wanted to get naked.  Well, it was weird walking in there.  Remember, there was no music playing.  It was just silence.  It was him and his buddy, and they're just sitting there.  That weird guy.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was not. 
[02:19:30]  So I thought it'd be fun to just get completely naked in front of everybody.  A lot of this coming in.  Troy is like king hipster.  Oh.  Like, everyone thinks you are total fucking, like, hipster trash.  What does that mean?  What does a hipster mean?  You're a hipster.  Like you.  What is that?  What does that mean?  It's a guy that carries himself, thinks like you, kind of, you know, too cool for the  room kind of a thing.  Yeah, I don't really think I'm too cool for the room.  Well, that's what.  Those are Troy's friends.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:20:00]  Those are like hipsters right there.  Those are your friends, dude?  No.  That's what they look like.  The white guy with the hipster hat.  Yeah.  Those are your friends?  And very trendy.  You got to be a little trendy.  Definitely.  Anti-status quo.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Maroon shoes.  Anything that's cool to more than five people, you wouldn't be caught dead near or wearing  because it's already fucking commercialized and sucks.  DeLorean tattoos.  Shit like that.  Yeah, whatever.  That's fine.  If that's the way. 
[02:20:30]  Too cool for dating.  Oh, my God.  They're saying that.  Yeah, too cool for dating.  I'm dating somebody now, though.  His mohawk wig.  It's not a mohawk.  I'm just reading.  I'm just reading.  I'd say fohawk.  We're just jealous you have so much fucking hair.  It's amazing hair.  Patrick in Philadelphia.  Troy's bifurious.  Pretentious asshole.  His penis ring.  Yeah.  You got penis piercing.  What's your favorite five bands?  People saying Pepper Hicks is a fucking hipster.  He's the king of the hipsters. 
[02:21:00]  Pepper Hicks right now is the reigning virus hipster king.  I would fucking...  I don't know.  That's fake shit.  He's a fake hipster, yeah.  You don't think that's real?  Nah, it's just for the radio.  Just to help Ron, yeah.  He's just doing a hipster gimmick?  Well, you know.  Someone else has to talk in that show.  As opposed to who?  Ah, well.  See Eastside Dave's video with Pepper?  Was that with Pepper?  Yes.  Yes, that's Pepper.  Another one where Eastside Dave just screams.  Screams and perhaps falls down.  Falls down.  We've noticed a trend with all of Eastside Dave's videos. 
[02:21:30]  He's got to fall down now?  He has to scream and yell at something and then fall down.  Right.  I don't know.  That's formulaic.  Do you know the band?  It is formulaic.  Hey, when something works, you go with it.  Exactly.  Just keep going with it.  Do you know the limousines?  Yeah.  Hmm?  Do you know the song, Very Busy People?  Yes.  They're saying that should be your theme song.  Oh, shit.  Is that an insult?  It's like a hipster song, I guess, because I don't know that song.  I'm down with hipster.  It's on All Nation.  It's a good song.  That's fine.  Whatever.  Is it your friends?  What's your favorite top five bands?  Top five bands? 
[02:22:00]  Hold that.  You're out.  The Beatles.  Oh, all right.  It's hipster.  Faith No More.  Oh, yeah.  The Faith No More crap again.  Why'd I ask this?  The Beatles are hipster.  The Beatles are a little hipster.  The Beastie Boys.  Oh, yeah.  Brooklyn.  Hipster.  Clicky.  Yeah.  Clutch.  Yeah.  And the Dillinger Escape Plan.  Oh, yeah.  Stop it.  Yeah, of course.  That would be on everyone's top five.  Hipster is a marketing angle these days, and Troy has bought into it.  I would say hipster is becoming like a marketable thing. 
[02:22:30]  Remember when Nirvana first came out and got popular?  Every commercial looked like their videos with that weird out of focus and then in focus,  depth of field, foreground, background shit that was going on.  And that right now, and then it got to the point where I think AARP started using it to  some of their ads.  And that was it.  You knew it was done.  And now hipster is kind of a thing that's going on with the- 
[02:23:00]  Do you wear the winter hat in summertime?  No.  Yeah, you do.  Is that a hipster thing?  No.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it is.  But I don't wear a beanie in there.  This is why most of those hipsters are just, they're frauds, and that's their problem.  Yeah.  Like rock guys in the 80s, right?  They have long hair.  They were metal guys.  They wanted to bang chicks.  Right.  That's who they were.  Fucking like, you know, you look at thugs, fucking rappers, their pants are down.  You know what they are.  I'm a fucking thug.  That's how I dress.  Yeah.  Hipsters are these fucking, this false, I'm not attractive.  I'm kind of a nerd. 
[02:23:30]  It's a phony embracing of nerd culture, but they really think that they're smart and beautiful  and important, but it's this fucking mock humility and this absolute, the whole thing  is based in an absolute fraud.  They want to be nerds, but they're not nerds, and deep down they know they're not nerds,  but they think that they're really, if they look like nerds, they'll be interesting, but  deep down they know they're brilliant and beautiful.  Oh, did you hit it. 
[02:24:00]  Did Jimmy Norton just define the hipster?  But you know, some people are, they fit into like an artistic category, so they don't want  to be a metal dude with a leather jacket, and they don't want to be a thug with pants  hanging down.  They like art, they like simple things, they like reading, they like being cultured in  certain things.  So I don't think, you know.  But they're frauds.  But maybe they're, how are they frauds?  Because they like art.  Because the majority of them, because, like the art is terrific, but most of them are,  they're probably suburban kids, they have money, but they're trying to act broke. 
[02:24:30]  There's nothing worse than somebody with money trying to act broke.  Punk rock kids, they're acting like they're squatters with a house in the suburbs, and they'll  come squat in a city and panhandle with a dog.  Because so, punk rock kids fit under that same category as well.  I'm sure some of them do.  So Troy wears glasses without prescription lenses.  Those are not usually exclusive things.  You do?  No, he does.  I've never done that.  Yes, he does.  I have prescription glasses that I never wear.  He wore, no, he wore just the frames the other day.  What are some of those other hipster takes? 
[02:25:00]  Just like you had dreadlocks the other day.  That's right.  Anyone know other hipster things?  Skinny jeans is hipster.  Skinny jeans, yeah.  But I mean, you know.  The geekiest glasses you can find, definitely.  That's what Troy does.  Because I'm a nerd, man.  But see, now I'm not into looking good.  Now, when this comes into pop culture.  And then that dumb hat, like your grandfather would wear, it's just like, doesn't really  fit into it, but it's just like my granddad's hat, can I tell you what?  Trying so hard to look like they put no thought in the outfit.  Right.  But they put a lot of thought in the outfit.  Oh, my God.  Incredible.  Jim, what happens when all this comes into main pop culture then? 
[02:25:30]  Is that okay then?  But was it not okay before because these kids were wearing it, but now that it's on TV commercials,  now it's okay.  To me, what bothers me is that they're just trying to think that they're so humble, and  they're not embraced.  Why don't they just be the arrogant little twats that they are?  I wouldn't mind that.  If you see, I'm not shitting on rich kids from Beverly Hills for being that, because  that's who they are.  This is a bunch of guys with money, or women with money, trying to act like they're just  lonely, man, and they just crawled out of a box and threw a hat on, man. 
[02:26:00]  How do I look?  I can't even tell.  Meanwhile, he knows every inch.  They print that fucking douchey hat.  Oh, is my hat tilted properly?  Oh, fuck yourself, Henry Fonda.  Yes, Henry Fonda.  You picked that hat out so it would fit you right.  You don't even need those glasses.  So what happens if they like it, though?  It's what they want to wear.  I didn't say it should be illegal.  I'm just saying why I don't like it, though.  I'm just saying that's what they like to wear.  It's a phony.  Handlebar mustaches are big right now.  It's their uniform.  Thank you.  Hope said it.  It's their uniform. 
[02:26:30]  You just said it.  Everybody has their uniform.  Metal dudes have their uniform.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  But what Jimmy's saying is, yeah, exactly.  They're making believe they don't have a uniform.  That's what bothers Jimmy.  They're pretending they're nerds.  But I don't understand what's wrong with going to this.  They should just embrace it and go, this is our uniform.  What's wrong with going to a secondhand store or a Salvation Army and going, you know what?  I'm not going to go to Macy's and pick out all my clothes.  I'm going to go to a Salvation store and pick out something from the fucking 70s that no one's ever seen before.  Because they have, first of all, because they're not doing it just that they have money. 
[02:27:00]  And they're trying to act like they don't have money.  And they're trying so hard to be different.  So they'll probably pick something they don't like just because they think other people will think they're different.  It's based in everything they do is based in the perception of other people.  Maybe that's all of us.  Why do you have to do something that everybody's doing?  Why do you go, oh, everybody's wearing this shirt.  Because everybody, that's not original.  Everyone's doing that.  And you're calling me a hipster and you're saying that they have money.  I am.  And they're saying that they have money.  I am fucking broke, dude.  But the majority of them have money. 
[02:27:30]  You know that.  Plus they go to Salvation Army because all the cool kids shop at Macy's.  But they're going to Salvation Army to be one of the cool kids.  To act like they're broke.  They want to act broke.  I don't have any money.  But meanwhile, they do.  Nobody really poor thinks that way.  If you told people in most of those neighborhoods how much these guys have access to and the amount of money they spend on clothes,  people would go, you fucking asshole.  Like they're just trying to slum it for a little while before they go on to live their real lives.  I just don't understand why it would be a problem saying, okay, I don't want to shop at JCPenney's or I don't want to shop at The Gap or wherever. 
[02:28:00]  I'm going to go to a secondhand store and pick out something unique that was maybe cool 30 years ago.  You're missing the point.  It's the intent that Jimmy has a problem with.  But what's wrong with trying to be different than what everybody else is doing?  They're not trying to be different.  They're trying to be like each other.  Yeah, they're not trying to be different.  Which every other group does.  But they're starting a trend that's going to be cool in two years.  So in two years, people are going to be wearing this shit.  Because they kind of look down on it.  It's a fake.  I see a photographer. 
[02:28:30]  Let me start telling you.  I start to piss badly.  Tyra's starting to wrap up.  Okay, I'm going to pee.  From where?  The other place.  From Howard.  So she's going to come over here now.  Oh.  It's a fake embracing of nerd culture.  That's why I don't like it.  And it's a fake.  I don't care what I look like.  So what's real nerd culture then?  What is that?  People like Bill Gates was real nerds.  Steve Jobs.  Those type of guys that were ignored in school.  We all know who nerds are.  Let's be honest.  Right.  They're trying to act like they're beautiful versions of that.  That actually don't think about it.  It would be like that style of clothing.  It's okay to. 
[02:29:00]  That's not what the problem is.  You do though.  Because they're being dishonest in the base or core of what they're doing.  I don't care what they wear.  But they're acting like they just threw it together.  And they're not thinking.  They are thinking.  Well.  That'd be like if I came in with.  Obviously they put their outfit together.  They're thinking about what they're doing.  But.  But they're not acting.  They're not.  They're trying to act like they're not thinking about what they're doing.  Call them a hipster.  Just watch them go.  Shut up.  Yeah.  Fuck you.  You know.  If you call a rock guy a rocker.  Or a fucking thug guy.  Hey man.  You're a fucking thug.  You know.  Troy wouldn't admit he was a hipster. 
[02:29:30]  But hipster is a bad word to hipsters.  Do you remember the fucking embarrassment when Vanilla Ice got called out for being a fucking suburban kid or whatever.  When he was trying to act like he came from the.  That's the same thing as that.  It's just in reverse.  Yeah.  And I don't think that what's.  Well.  I mean he's a little bit different.  But I don't think there's anything wrong with liking hip hop culture and coming from the suburbs.  Just because you come from the suburbs.  Doesn't mean you can't like hip hop.  I used to love hip hop.  Nothing wrong with it at all.  The problem is when you pretend you're from the inner city.  And you like hip hop culture.  That's where the fraudulent comes in.  So where are these kids.  These kids are just pretending that they're nerds. 
[02:30:00]  Yes.  There's a lot of pretending going on there.  They're trying to come off like they're nerds.  But maybe they don't fit into a specific category.  Sure they do.  They fit into that category.  Which is a huge category.  This is where they fit in then.  If you're trying too hard to be different.  Then you have no sense of yourself.  Because you're basing on what you do.  You're talking about 18 year old kids.  What 18 year old kid knows who the fuck they are.  Well I'm just.  Okay.  But fair enough.  But I'm not just talking about the 18 year olds.  I'm talking about the older ones who are in their 20s.  Obviously 18 year olds.  We're going to go back to this topic.  Oh yeah.  I'm going to pee.  I'll be back. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Tyre Banks is next.  And Troy we'll have you back on after Tyre.  All right.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Of course it is.  And we got to get right into this.  Tyre Banks in studio.  Tyre.  Hello.  Hi Tyre.  Hi guys.  Look how pretty Tyre is.  Wow.  Isn't that crazy?  She's heard it her whole life.  I know.  But you are so fucking high.  Oh.  Thank you.  It is an XL channel.  I've not heard that my whole life. 
[02:31:00]  Yes you have.  No I went through very often.  Were you a gangly child?  Beyond.  Really?  Yeah.  A lot of models were.  But I was very much that.  And I used to get stared at.  But for the wrong reasons.  Oh really?  Yeah.  Like what the hell.  She has a huge forehead.  Her eyes are crazy huge.  Like no.  How does that all of a sudden like work out for you?  It kind of just goes.  I still got kind of a you know forehead on me and my eyes are still big but everything  kind of fell into shape.  It just kind of starts to change.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I gained 50 pounds for one so that helped.  When did the ugly phase go? 
[02:31:30]  Because I'm 43 and I'm still waiting to blossom.  50 for you.  Oh you're still doing so.  Oh thanks.  Oh look.  We have such a little amount of time with you.  You're a very busy gal today.  You wrote a book?  Yes.  And this isn't like a biography or anything.  It's kind of.  No it's not a biography.  Although it's very inspired by my life.  Like remember I was 15.  Gangly.  Right.  Insecure.  My lead girl in my book Model Land.  Her name is Tukey.  Tukey de la Creme.  How about that for a name?  Tukey de la Creme.  Tukey de la Creme.  Didn't Jimmy just have one of those for dessert? 
[02:32:00]  Stop it.  Oh no.  Oh my god.  That's a good one.  No but she's awkward, very insecure and she gets discovered to go to this modeling school.  This magical modeling school and she doesn't know why she's there.  She thinks she's actually going to be murdered while she is there.  Intrigue.  Intrigue.  All right.  Is there like a seedy underside to modeling though?  Like is that what kind of inspires us?  It has to be like you know acting and all that stuff has like a seedy underbelly to it.  Yeah there definitely is a dark underbelly to the modeling world and thank god I never was 
[02:32:30]  a victim of it or interested in it.  No.  It didn't call my name.  Did you take off pretty quickly or did you have to go through a lot of...  I know that's why.  Let me turn around like this.  Hi.  If you hear something smart it was from me.  Yes.  Did you have to go through a lot of the auditioning and runway shows that were kind of you know  not quite the premiere ones?  Oh of course.  Like I started off in Los Angeles and like I was in the Sunday newspaper.  You know the $12.99 t-shirt sale. 
[02:33:00]  Hi.  Now LA isn't really a good place for models I found out.  It's okay.  Yeah.  It's a secondary market in America.  New York is the primary market.  And LA is secondary.  Yeah.  Why don't models ever smile when they're walking down...  I was at a runway show actually last night for something Barcelona.  Some guy.  Crystal Barcelona.  Yeah.  And you know they just they all are very attractive but none of them smile.  That's because it's like a fierceness.  Why is that?  I think it intimidates you into buying the clothes. 
[02:33:30]  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  I think there's some kind of like...  It doesn't want to take away from the clothes either probably right?  A smile kind of just makes it about her as opposed to...  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know in France you know mannequin means the word model.  In America we've taken it to mean like a stiff you know inanimate thing.  So that's kind of tell you that you don't want to shine too much.  Although as a model I was a cheesy ham honey.  Were you?  Did you ever...  I was smiling and winking and woo!  You ever fall off your shoes?  I never fell.  Never had a fall?  No.  But I did have my shoelaces tied together once. 
[02:34:00]  Who the hell did that?  I don't know.  But it was in a fashion show.  Oh one of the girls.  A little catty.  Exactly.  In Model Land I have something called Catwalk Corridor.  And for the models that are bitches in Model Land they get turned into cats.  And they are like subjected to have to stay in this corridor.  And they're like cats with like model faces.  No it's just like...  That's very odd.  Because of the catty bitches in Model Land.  Right.  So that was inspired by.  Is this like...  What's the...  Is this for like for teenagers, for adults, or for both? 
[02:34:30]  So it's YA which means young adult.  Yay!  And so but at the same time Twilight is YA and I read Twilight.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  It's like from young to everybody.  I've been...  I've been...  I've actually go out with a model.  And I'm not even kidding.  I know she's looking at me like shut up.  No I'm not.  Yes.  But and this is Fashion Week so there's so many shows that...  He does a lot of them.  I mean...  That she's doing.  And she comes home like just like...  Ugh.  Just disgusted and exhausted a lot of times. 
[02:35:00]  Did you go through that?  That's the phase I was trying to like see if you went through that crap.  Like disgusted?  What is she disgusted by?  The people?  Like yeah the people behind the scenes tend to really be ugh bastards and just like ugh.  Yeah.  There's a lot of fabulousness darling and da da da da.  Fabulousness yes.  Yeah.  And they like to make the models feel very insecure and dependent on them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And just like treat them like you know hey put this on and shut up.  Shut up.  Which you know I guess it works.  So is she your woman or is she somebody you're dating?  Yeah.  That's how that works.  Oh.  She's your girlfriend.  Yeah.  Do you live together? 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  What agency is she with?  She's with...  Is it API?  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well you know.  That's how it works.  I met one last night who I kind of liked a little bit.  We did a shoot together and she was from the Ford Modeling Agency.  Oh that's a big one.  And I wanted to email her and she gave me her modeling card which had no personal information.  I'm such a zero.  Call my people.  Is the TV show going away now?  Is it done officially? 
[02:36:00]  Which one?  The Tyra Banks show.  The Tyra Banks show.  Are we done with that?  Any day it should be officially over.  Oh you already taped it I guess right?  That's right.  Yeah.  So I was finished a year ago and then we were in a year of reruns.  That was the hardest thing in my life.  How do y'all do this every day?  It's a grind.  It's terrible.  It's hard.  It's hard.  The thing is you guys don't have to worry about like hair and makeup and all that stuff.  Sometimes.  No you're right.  We don't.  Did you cancel it or did they cancel you or were you done or did they go look we don't  want to do this anymore?  Yeah.  No it was a combination.  Okay.  It was a combination of the recession and us looking at the profits weren't so great. 
[02:36:30]  Oh really?  And then also I was burnt.  Now did you take a lot of criticism on the show because we had noticed a lot of people  would write in things like hey Tyra it's not about you.  Yes.  Like here it is you know this woman coming on today she lost both of her arms but we're  going to you know try to make her feel good and everything and then you were like you  know when I was a kid my arm went numb and I fell asleep one day and people kind of  looked and went like hey Tyra not quite as not quite as drastic.  Did you catch a lot of flack for that? 
[02:37:00]  That exact thing.  All right.  I went to the ultimate extreme there by the way.  Don't lie.  So whenever I do anything I try to research as much as possible and the production company  that I was with got me a coach and the coach told me to do something called saming and  to share my own stories and that a good listener a good listener.  No no no I'm not even blaming somebody but I'm just saying that's a technique.  Yeah.  Also you have to realize that I've done saming before as well.  It's like a perception thing. 
[02:37:30]  So somebody could do that and it might not look as strong as me doing it and that's all  I'll say.  But you know what I'm saying.  I don't mean somebody is a talk show host.  I just mean like.  I got you.  You're attacking Oprah.  No it's okay.  Oh God.  No.  No.  I meant you guys.  You just grabbed your arm.  Please don't do this to me.  Awful.  No.  What was the worst thing that happened to you doing.  But yeah you know what I'm saying.  To get somebody to share you talk about your own.  Like this happened to me.  Right right right.  What was the worst thing that happened doing that show.  What was the worst experience.  Worst.  Was there an incident or anything like that that really bothered you. 
[02:38:00]  I mean because you're doing it every day it's hard to like say.  Single out like one thing.  Yeah.  But it was definitely hard.  I remember something about a banner or something.  I did like homeless.  Oh the homeless one was good.  The homeless one was good.  Yeah where I went and was homeless.  When you went out on the street and was quite frankly the most attractive homeless person  I ever saw on the street.  Oh my God.  I disagree.  No one's buying that you were homeless.  Yeah.  I was a little like well she's a little too pretty.  Yeah.  You still had a sparkle in your eye.  Those homeless people just got dead eyes. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  Lifeless eyes like a doll's eyes.  Hey is that homeless lady of a publicist?  Yeah.  And you were only out there for two hours I think.  Oh.  No we were out there for all day.  All day.  Oh no.  I'm not saying that I lived for a week there but it was all day.  Yeah it was television.  Come on it's kind of rough to come up with ideas for shows on a daily basis too.  Let's be real here.  You do look very good.  Thank you.  I'm not hitting on you.  Do you guys have daughters?  Oh no.  No.  No one.  Stranged.  I had one.  He does.  How old is your daughter?  Oh she's two. 
[02:39:00]  And she has a there's a picture of her that is an aspiring model where she's wearing her  her long little jacket.  She's ugly.  She's adorable.  I'm just kidding.  Oh my god.  I'm kidding.  Little Riley's adorable.  She's very cute.  Do you guys have sons?  No children.  He has a son.  He does.  16 months old.  Oh babies.  Babies.  Babies.  Yeah.  We all put off families to get our careers going to this point Tyra.  That's right.  Yeah.  What a crapshoot that was that didn't pan out.  Starting a little late but. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  Did you write this whole book?  I did.  Okay.  Is it the first thing you've ever written?  It's not the first book that I've ever written.  It's the first non-fiction.  I'm sorry.  First fiction.  Sorry.  I did non-fiction like 10 years ago.  Do you like doing this more?  I prefer non-fiction to write because it's just easier.  Like I've never written fiction but it's easier because it just happens.  Because it just is.  So it's the truth and you write it down.  Yeah.  Yeah.  With fiction the thing that's like amazing for it for me is I'd be in the library.  I spend a lot of time in the library and I'm just writing and you just go and I want  her to fly and then she's going to run and then turn into a snake and then you know 
[02:40:00]  just like it's just.  You can do whatever you want.  Yeah.  It just goes crazy especially with adventure and fantasy.  We should ask her about the banner.  What is the banner?  I don't know.  Remember the banner outside the.  Aw.  Banner.  Oh there's the picture of her.  Oh my God.  She looks like a little Burberry model in that gray.  It's like kind of gray trench peacoat looking fabulousness.  Oh my God.  Burberry.  Yeah.  This is really fancy here. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  But then again what are you going to say?  The photography is all gorgeous.  Look at Roland.  He's clawing at the window that Tyra has to go.  Oh I've got to go.  Tyra.  Oh I've got to go.  She's very very busy.  You guys are great.  Thank you so much.  I guess what I've got to find out about the banner.  Thank you.  You're so fabulous and I love that hat you have on which reminds me of this hat that  I had on because I love it because I really really think hats are really fabulous and  I had an experience with a hat.  That's exactly what it is.  I never heard it called saming. 
[02:41:00]  I like that a lot.  Saming.  Yeah.  They're samers, toppers and downers.  Samers are oh my God.  Me too.  So say something.  Anything.  I like trannies.  Oh my God.  I like trannies too.  Say it again.  That's a samer.  Say it again.  I love trannies.  Well, I can tell you love trannies because you look like a little bit of an ant.  Downer.  That's a downer.  Oh, okay.  And a topper.  And a topper.  Well, that would be the tranny.  Oh my God.  I like trannies, Sam.  Okay.  I like trannies.  Well, I invented trannies.  I was the tranny.  Do you understand?  So the best thing to be is to be a samer. 
[02:41:30]  A samer because you're at least revealing something about yourself as opposed to knocking  somebody.  Yeah, that makes sense.  Very good.  Okay.  Tyra, thanks so much.  Should we finish up the commercials?  No?  We want to keep talking?  Throw, man.  Finish up.  That way we can take our banner.  All right.  What's the name of the book there, Tyra?  The name of the book is Model Land and it is out tomorrow.  Are you doing signings?  I am.  Where can we find people?  Wait, hold on.  What the hell did you just try to say?  She just turned and faced me. 
[02:42:00]  She looks really good.  Where can people find out your signings?  You can find out my signings on ModelLandBook.com and on Model Land Facebook's page.  So if you want to meet Tyra and get a book signed, that helps a lot with sales.  ModelLandBook.com.  And the website is amazing.  I'm so proud of it.  Very cool.  Isn't it cool?  It's like an alternate universe.  A lot of stuff on there.  Tyra is really hot.  Yes, you've looked fantastic.  And what are you going to do next after this book?  I'm writing another one.  So it's all about books for a while?  It's about books right now and TV production and a whole bunch of other stuff.  Y'all, I'm a businesswoman.  I'm doing my thing. 
[02:42:30]  You're busy.  Yeah.  Very cool.  Thank you guys so much.  All right.  Tyra Banks, everyone.  Bye.  Series XM.  Series XM.  The OPRA 3 Show.  Epic fail.  Epic fail.  What?  We didn't ask her about the Fatty Pig Fatty banner.  Well, she's like, what banner?  Yeah, banner.  She wasn't being too mean. 
[02:43:00]  No, I just wanted to ask her about it to see if she even has a recollection of that.  The famous Fatty Pig Fatty banner that ended up outside her studio where she recorded the Tyra Banks show.  All right.  Let's work through that then.  Let's say it did happen that you got it out and what's the next step?  We just point and laugh at her.  And then who's going to clean up Roland's brains after he blows them out in the hallway? 
[02:43:30]  Roland was.  It's not like we haven't done this before.  He would have been so nerve-wracked.  Roland was out there going, yeah, I thought it was a good appearance.  I thought it was a good appearance.  Yeah, yeah.  But Tyra, I asked her.  I didn't say Fatty Pig Fatty, but I asked her about the sign.  What did she say?  I said, do you remember a very critical banner being hung outside your TV studio?  It was on TMZ, I think, or one of those.  It was on E.  It was on E.  Okay.  But she said no.  She didn't remember it, and she didn't know what we were talking about.  Oh. 
[02:44:00]  She is so fucking hot, by the way.  She also didn't know that we had played hours of her TV show on the air.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  It filled up a lot of radio time.  Yeah, it did.  I wanted to fart so bad before she came in, I just couldn't muster one up.  That would be good.  I wanted her to walk into a horrible fart.  Yeah.  But I couldn't do it.  What happened?  She was nice, though.  She was nice.  She was too beautiful to mess with?  She was nice.  I think so.  Too nice.  She wasn't kind of cute.  She was fucking beautiful.  She was pretty, but she was also...  TV doesn't do her justice.  In person, she is a fucking knockout. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  I mean, she looks good on TV, obviously, but she looks even hotter in person.  Great curves.  What an ass man.  Would you?  I mean, I know you don't like the black girl, but...  Yeah, because she's like barely.  She's got two black parents?  Yeah, but she's got those white features.  Let's be honest here.  They're not putting fucking...  She's a black girl ass?  They're not putting...  She had a black girl ass.  ...girls from fucking Uganda on the roadway. 
[02:45:00]  But she had a black girl's ass.  Look at her, though.  She's sore.  Okay, look.  Look at her mouth.  Oh, yeah.  Okay?  Pouty.  It's a very...  Pouty, right?  It's a very...  She has white features.  She has dark skin, but her nose, her mouth are very white person, Caucasian type features.  But she has lips like those people.  No, she has full...  Say it like that.  They're not...  No, she has like full lips that...  Pouty.  White people would love full lips like that, but not, you know, crazy, you know, Sudanese kind 
[02:45:30]  of stuff going on, you know?  I think she's embarrassed to be so tall because during the break, we're like, wow, you're really  tall.  She goes, I'm not that tall.  Look at the heels I'm wearing.  But she was...  Her head almost hit the ceiling.  She's so tall.  Yeah, she's a tall one.  She's a tall drink of water.  And booty for days.  She's a tall drink of Kool-Aid.  Because those people, Sam.  She was very sexy, I thought.  And she...  You know what?  It's...  If I attack somebody, it's usually a reaction to them doing something in the studio that 
[02:46:00]  I don't like.  No, no.  I wasn't going to attack her.  I wanted to know if she even knew about it.  That's all.  But she was...  There was something about her.  I was like, eh, she's being nice.  She's selling a silly book.  Like, a silly book.  But it's like hummus.  That's even worse than bringing up the matter.  She's selling a silly book.  I don't even mean that to shit on it.  It's just like, you know, it's a little novel.  It's cute.  It's a Harry Potter novel with a model.  People might love it, you know?  Yeah.  It'll find its audience.  I don't know.  Whatever.  Wow.  Yeah. 
[02:46:30]  Jesus H. Christ.  She's busty.  She certainly is.  She had a big fucking set of tits on her, right?  Well, that's right.  Is that what you meant?  Yeah, I was trying to be classy.  So she had the white features, you say, right?  Yeah.  So you would definitely go there, right?  Well, she's got...  What wouldn't you do with her?  What?  Live next door to her?  Speaking of France.  Would you, you know...  Probably wouldn't lick her ass.  Oh, what are you fucking... 
[02:47:00]  What are you, a communist?  Exactly.  What's the matter with you?  Fucking cracker crumbs all over the place.  Oh, I wonder why.  Oh, sorry.  Mr. Smashed my crackers.  I apologize.  I'd like to get tough once in a while.  Show you his boss.  Crackers all over the place.  Crackers smash him.  All right.  Wow.  I guess that was...  Is that her?  No.  Who is that one?  Those people seem to look alike, Sam.  No, they don't.  Oh, my God.  Well, I got confused there, didn't I?  I don't know why.  Well, models look alike.  That's what I was saying.  Well, they try to make them look the same on the runway, yes. 
[02:47:30]  She was cool.  What the hell?  Yeah, what are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  You know?  What would you do with those tits?  Wow.  Great question.  What would you do with those, Sam?  Well, I did ask if she had gotten, you know, any people saying that she...  You ever shit about that?  Yeah.  What?  She'd always try to top the other person with her problem.  But she addressed it.  She said her coach.  She was nice.  She has a coach that told her to do that.  Talent coach.  What kind of dummy is that?  We've never had a coach. 
[02:48:00]  No.  It must be nice.  Have someone coaching you for this shit.  I've done a little coaching.  No, you haven't.  I teach you how to kiss.  I taught you when you was young, Gregory.  You don't remember.  No, thank God.  I was teaching you how to kiss.  It started on your neck, and you ran up the apple tree.  Oh, Jesus.  It's even worse when it's a boy.  It really is.  Uncle Paul's disgusting.  He sure doesn't discriminate.  You see the video of the little girl that doesn't want to be black? 
[02:48:30]  Yeah, but this was like one of my stories.  What are you talking about?  From the past.  I had told a story.  Oh, this shit happened to you.  You know, when I was watching this video, I'm like, why does this seem familiar?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  It was Jimmy Jackson's daughter.  If you remember, when I lived in California, there was this guy, Jimmy Jackson.  Colin Quinn loves Jimmy Jackson stories, by the way.  I have to interrupt.  Jimmy Jackson.  He was a good old boy, fucking had a rent string of horses and everything, and the Marines  from Camp Pendleton would show up, and he'd put them on these rent horses, and I would 
[02:49:00]  have to lead them up through the trails.  That was my job.  The little trail boss.  And Jimmy was, let's, you know, let's just call a spade a spade here.  He would call a spade a spade.  He sure would.  That guy was a true racist.  And he'd always give the black guys that came up to rent horses the worst, most sway-backed  horses out of all of them.  And they were sitting there going, come on, come on, Mick.  And the horse is just like, I'm not fucking moving anywhere. 
[02:49:30]  They'd get left behind.  All the other Marine guys are like, yee-haw, like running, and there's, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Is JJ still alive?  Jimmy Jackson, I don't know.  He was, uh, he was like 30 back in 76.  That's, uh, 75 years ago.  That's possible, sure.  That's possible.  Oh, that's very possible.  Yeah, yeah.  So, uh, so he had a daughter named Shyla, and Shyla was, uh, uh, I guess about two years 
[02:50:00]  old or something, and, uh, uh, oh, Uncle Paul.  And she had, uh, she had blonde hair, just a very pale, white fucking kid.  And whenever she was doing something she shouldn't be doing, Jimmy Jackson would say, and I quote,  he turned to her and go, uh-oh, Shyla, you're turning into a nigger.  I see it right in front.  Don't you see it?  And he'd get other people to go, oh, yeah, I see it.  Oh, shit, Shyla.  I see it turning.  You're getting darker.  And she had a little speech impediment, like a kid. 
[02:50:30]  And she would start crying and go, I don't want to be a nigger.  And everyone thought it was the funniest fucking thing ever.  And, and apparently I saw this video and was like, hey, wait a minute.  Yeah.  And the father in this just being a fucking, what an asshole.  Of course.  Uh, but yeah, it brought back, uh, fond memories.  Well, let's play it.  Uh, the video's everywhere.  Yeah.  It's pretty much a viral video, but here's the audio of it.  I don't want to turn black. 
[02:51:00]  What?  I don't want to turn black.  Why don't you want to turn black?  I don't want to.  But what will happen?  What's the difference?  I don't want to turn black.  You will still be able to wear the same clothes.  You'll have the same toys.  You'll still play with yo-yo.  You'll still live here with us.  Why don't you ride my bike?  You can ride your bike.  Ride anyone else's too.  You can be our little black bike rider. 
[02:51:30]  Stealing them.  Listen, all little girls, when they turn four, they turn just a little bit black.  You're not going to be, you're not going to be like all the way black.  You'll be like brown, like Daddy's sweater.  Like a, like brown?  Like, like an M&M.  Like an M&M?  Yeah, like, you know, when we go to the store, and you buy the M&M's, and they're all the different colors?  Oh, yeah.  You're just going to be like a brown M&M. 
[02:52:00]  You're not going to be like all the way, like black, black, like the sky dark, black.  Not like that.  Just like chocolate.  Do you want to be chocolate?  That'll be fun.  No, but you're going to be all the way black.  No.  Yeah.  The father's hateable.  Yeah, yeah.  He really is hateable.  Yeah, what's he doing?  He's just a fucking douchebag trying to get a viral video.  He's hateable.  I think it worked.  Did it?  I don't know. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This thing's everywhere.  Yeah, this.  Is he just getting death threats, though?  I don't know.  Let's just say it's...  Little girl doesn't want to be black.  That's the title.  I wonder what's in it.  But if he told her blue, she'd just say the same thing.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, yeah.  How many views does that asshole have?  And he should have went all in and said the N-word.  What the fuck, you know?  Mr. Brave Man.  70,000.  That's just on Brave.  No, that's...  Yeah, there's many different versions of the fucking video.  Yes, yes.  You saw the black woman on Google Earth by now?  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[02:53:00]  Out of Miami?  Yeah, you know what she was doing?  She was washing herself.  What do you mean she was washing?  Well, I read a few of the comments.  And apparently down there, a lot of these women that are from the islands...  Little Haiti, they're saying?  Yeah, yeah.  That area of Miami?  They go out naked early in the morning and take jugs of water and, like, wash their pussies  and shit, and then back in the house.  Why?  They don't have showers?  I have no idea what the motive is behind this, but I hear that that's how they wash. 
[02:53:30]  They wash that way because it's their culture, or is it because they're poor?  I don't know.  I don't...  He wouldn't even...  Because even if you're poor, you can find a better way to wash yourself.  I wouldn't even hazard to speculate.  All I know is...  Does anyone know?  Did you see this, Jimmy, on Google Earth?  I didn't know.  A lot of people...  Oh, the naked lady?  Yeah.  A lot of people in the comments said they live down there and see this every morning.  Really?  They just see these black women.  They go out...  How do they go in their backyard?  And I think that kind of was their side backyard. 
[02:54:00]  She really didn't have a backyard.  It was going to look like a corner or something.  I don't know, but yeah.  I think it might be kind of a, I don't know, thing that they do.  Click the map.  Click the map.  So the Google Earth coming down the street, you're checking out this address, and there  she is naked with a jug of water.  See?  And she's got a big bowl thing in front of her.  Right.  Like a base or a barbecue thing.  I don't know what the fuck it is.  This thing's everywhere, too.  Let's see it. 
[02:54:30]  Zoom up.  Oh, it's moving?  Yeah, yeah.  Got to be a nice GF for us.  And then she's bending over.  Yeah, because she's got to wash her ass.  Jeez.  Digging in there deep.  Those Google things, man.  I guess they censored it.  This guy captured it?  Yeah, they censored it, but it's there.  It's now out there.  It's everywhere.  But now if you check out that address, I think there's red bars where they blurred her.  But it doesn't matter.  A camera went around for Google, snapped a picture of a woman naked, and now it's out 
[02:55:00]  there on the internet.  Of course, she was outside.  She was outside, yeah.  Now, that is obviously the tipping point there where it's like, all right, it's her fault.  She seems...  But it does seem to be if something's going on, you don't know if that car is going to  come past your house, take a picture, and, you know, fuck you over somehow.  Well, you know, again, if you're doing something outside, as they say, you don't have a reasonable  expectation of privacy.  Well, this is true.  But maybe the car of a young lady.  Oh, what if there's a car out there in front of your house? 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, a car of a young lady, and your wife's at work or something.  Well, then you're being dishonest.  You can't be mad at people.  Hey, they're going to catch me being deceitful.  Too bad for you.  Don't be deceitful.  I'm just saying that would be their argument.  I'm deceitful, so I'm okay with it.  So I'm fine with it.  Yeah.  That lady likes bike tires, too, huh?  A lot of bike tires.  What about through a window of your house?  I don't know if that's happened yet.  I don't either.  Yeah, that might be a little harder.  Oh, yeah.  If she was inside the house and that door was open, you'd still sit. 
[02:56:00]  She's awful.  She is a fucking disaster.  She really is bad.  Terrible.  She's a mess.  Just fucking scrubbing out that stank hole.  This looks like...  I mean, there's a street right there, and that doesn't look like it's her backyard.  Who knows?  It doesn't even look like a yard.  Yeah, she's way out in the street.  Fuck that.  You know what?  She has no right to expect privacy there.  She's outdoors.  She was waiting for the Google truck.  Of course she was.  Motherfucking Google truck.  Yeah, look at me, motherfucker.  George of South Carolina.  She's naked getting an ice cream.  Wants to explain what's going on, Ed.  Oh, okay.  All right. 
[02:56:30]  George knows.  Go ahead, George.  Hey, I think she's putting flea dip on that thing, and she can't do it in the house because  it'll stank up the house.  Jesus, George.  You know, with the accent and everything, it's just uncanny.  Sorry about that.  Wow.  Yeah, I don't know.  Reasonable expectation of privacy.  Yeah.  But there is just something odd about that.  Isn't there a site dedicated to all the shit they've caught on Google Earth?  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:57:00]  Or Street View?  Yeah, pictures.  They get a lot of hookers, I hear.  Oh, really?  A lot of hookers.  Could you find that site real fast?  Real fast?  Look who's working the computer.  Can you find that site by Thursday?  Oh, look, he doesn't like that.  Sam is a guy that just likes compliments.  Yeah.  That's it.  The second you insult Sam, boy, does he just go.  Who likes insults?  Well.  I've never met anyone.  Everybody in this room is a guy who just likes compliments. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, but you've got a point.  I bet when he was a kid, his mother said he was a wonderful Googler.  Yes.  You Googled better than all the other boys.  Did she say that, Sam?  Yes, she did.  She did, right?  If we could stop, you would realize the website's been up for a few minutes now.  We could look at it.  My Sam Googles like nobody's business.  I'll bet you should brag to the other moms like that.  And they'll be like, all right.  Yes.  He was a fucking kid.  He sucks.  You know, I honestly do believe that your mother, giving you so much adulation, love, and support  growing up, you take criticism, then I'll say a little worse than other people do. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah, but it's also because when I take criticism, I take it seriously and I try to improve myself  afterwards.  When did that ever happen?  Well, that's why I said try.  But I mean, my mom's not the only one who gives me adulation.  Just today, you were giving me quite a bit of adulation.  That was a complete misquote.  And I will be fucking hiring an attorney if you use that to promote your program.  I believe that will be on the promo.  It was completely taken out of context. 
[02:58:30]  I meant what my favorite hour of the show.  It inflated my ego.  Being at a certain time that I leave this building.  And that was my favorite time.  Not what comes on after this show at a certain time.  I heard what you said.  You picked the worst website for the Google Street View best of.  It's called Street View Fun.  No, that's not the one I saw.  This isn't fun.  He's yelling at you.  I want to see the prostitutes.  They have prostitutes on the side of the road.  Who's got that link?  We've all saw it. 
[02:59:00]  Last time you asked for a link, it didn't exist.  No, the black hole thing doesn't exist.  Oh, the link that doesn't exist.  That's it.  Sam's got an answer for everything.  It sure does.  It's the internet's fault.  Yeah.  My Sam Googles like nobody's business.  It's amazing how my son Googles.  He's going to be the world's greatest Googler.  Yes.  There's no such thing as that.  They don't have a comparison.  Are you on Google Sightseeing?  Are you?  No.  Well, how about we try that one?  Google Sightseeing?  Because the listeners are always right. 
[02:59:30]  You know what Sam's terrible at with Googling?  Radio, Google, hair trimming, talking, being a friend.  He's terrible at picking keywords.  Like, he types in things and it's like, well, of course you did.  You just said Google Sightseeing.  Well, how long have we been going on this?  I told you to do that.  You didn't find it?  No, right.  That's right.  Yeah, I'll be able to direct you.  I told you.  He told you.  What would you have typed in?  Google Sightseeing?  My Sam Googles. 
[03:00:00]  The best.  My Sam Googles the way Ted Williams played baseball.  You know, people have an idea what your mom's about.  You want to hear this, Sam?  Yeah.  Probably not.  No, I don't.  Go ahead, John.  Because I prefer insults to compliments.  No, Jimmy's going to like this one.  This is very accurate.  Go ahead, John.  Sam was a kid that always got the trophy when he was younger from his mom, no matter how  bad he did.  That's right.  Did your mom make special trophies for you when your team lost? 
[03:00:30]  My mom never made a trophy in her life.  Were you always the MVP?  I don't even know what this Google Sightseeing thing is.  Of course you don't.  Why would you?  You're terrible at Google.  We all know that, but Mother didn't know that.  Mother didn't know.  Mother was under the impression you're the best Googler ever.  My Sam is going to be the best Googler in the whole wide universe.  She wouldn't even say a word.  It wasn't around.  Exactly.  That's what was so odd about her.  She didn't know what Googler was.  Back then, it meant giving blowjobs to strangers.  Did you try gecoolplaces.com yet? 
[03:01:00]  No, I'm looking at Google Sightseeing.  Oh, fuck with that.  Who told you that one?  You.  G-E Cool Places?  That's the one.  Okay.  G-E Cool Places.  Yeah.  Everyone knows.  Let's see.  Uh-oh.  I don't know.  See?  Perfect.  Very good.  No, it doesn't at all.  How about you do this?  Go to Google.  Go to basic Google.  Yeah.  Right?  And pop in.  Oh, here we go.  Google.  Prostitutes.  Street View.  Prostitutes. 
[03:01:30]  Prostitutes.  Perfect.  All right?  Print.  Now, go to images.  Don't even fucking click.  Look at what we found.  Looky, looky here.  Thank you.  Looky, looky here.  Thank you.  That's how you Google.  Looky, looky here.  But you didn't ask for prostitutes.  You asked for a website dedicated to Google Street View.  No, no.  Fuck the website.  We wanted prostitutes.  Whenever we're looking for pictures of things, go right to images.  When we're looking for websites, stay on web.  Now, show us the prostitutes that they caught on Street View. 
[03:02:00]  Ah, look at that.  Look at that, Jimmy.  Now, that's fucking great.  Look at that.  They're just naked walking around the streets waiting for a dirty dick.  Are you sure they're hookers and not just beach girls?  Beach girls?  Beach girls.  That motherfuckers might be going to beaches or something.  Yeah, they're going to beach with fucking stiletto heels and cum dripping down their fucking thighs.  Give us another one.  Because maybe they're beach girls.  You know, Jimmy might have a point.  Is that a beach girl?  Is that a beach girl looking for a ride to the beach?  Yeah, she's saying, look, which way is the beach? 
[03:02:30]  I'm lost.  That's fucking hot hooker right there.  Yeah.  Would you?  Yeah.  Of course would I.  All right, let's go to the next.  Come on, more hookers.  She's looking, yeah.  How about this one?  Ah, there's something happening there.  She's fucking, there's a lady, she works there in that food and drink place.  She's on break.  She could.  Oh, that's not a prostitute.  No.  All right, what about this one?  Ah, yeah.  What about this one?  That's young runaway material.  She's not a prostitute.  What?  Yes, she is.  No, she works for the Department of Transportation and she's about to flag traffic and stop it. 
[03:03:00]  She's on the side of the road with a drink cup.  Exactly.  She's wearing the shortest fucking skirt or shorts I could see.  A turquoise blue little top.  Top and high heels.  High heels, all legs showing.  That's not a hitchhiking outfit there, Jimmy.  No.  No, she works for the Department of Transportation.  She was fired for dressing improperly on the job and drinking beverages.  Yes.  Yes.  And all her possessions are in that bag behind her.  And we're going to find just one that is a prostitute.  Just one prostitute.  All right, so far Jimmy might be correct.  I thought hookers are supposed to be skanky.  They're kind of hot on these. 
[03:03:30]  Why is Sam moving past some really good pictures?  Because even when the photos are there, Opie, he has no real clue.  What's wrong with the one right next to the one we just saw?  That's true.  There's a hot one with a great ass right by the beach.  You can see the sand starting across the street.  That's sand.  That looks like there isn't a beach within a thousand miles of that area.  They're in the desert.  They're beach girls.  They are.  What would you say about the fucking way her panties are up her asshole?  That's her bathing suit for the beach.  She's probably going to ask this gentleman in the car if he has a towel. 
[03:04:00]  Could we have a lift to the beach?  Somebody stole our beach chairs.  All right.  Well, we're going to find one.  I don't think so.  Which one do you want to check out next?  I don't care.  They have no hookers on this side.  There's no hookers apparently, Jim says.  That's right.  What about?  Oh, yeah.  This one doesn't even have baltoms on.  No, she's pretty much nude.  Yeah.  More beach girls.  More beach girls.  Yeah.  How come they're on a street where there's a giant tree?  I don't see a beach anywhere.  They have to get to the beach.  They don't live on the beach. 
[03:04:30]  Oh, okay.  It's a regular tree.  What are they just fucking materialize on the beach like apparitions?  I don't know.  What do you think they did?  They folded the distance between the projects and the beach.  And they wormholed to the beach.  Hookers.  Ah, where?  Oh, hi, hookers.  Hi, no.  Hi, little people.  He's so scared.  Cookie people.  Why is he frightened?  Uh, that's not a good one.  Yeah.  No, Sam.  We're just going to start getting...  Girls not wearing 18s.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, girls.  Pretty girls.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[03:05:00]  Woo.  That's...  She's a fairy.  She's dressed like a stripper.  She's a magical fairy.  No one goes to the beach like that.  Wow.  She has wings.  She is magical.  I'm looking at a picture of a girl through a window.  Yeah.  From Google.  And her tits are hanging out.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what happens.  That's impossible.  That's what happens.  Get a good one, Sam.  That's what I...  Keep getting good ones.  Come on, Sam.  You're really doing it now.  What are you doing?  Yeah, what are you doing?  This is a good one. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  Sam.  Sam.  Pictures of the same thing over and over again.  Sam.  Sam.  Yeah.  You're not even looking at my computer.  We talked a lot about music today.  Yes.  Yeah, we did.  And Danny found something terrific that I want to play for you.  Better.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Metallica and Stevie Wonder getting together for a little mashup.  What?  Okay.  It's Isn't She Lovely with Sad But True. 
[03:06:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Mom.  Mom.  I'll play this.  Jimmy, when are you going to be in Tampa?  Um...  Thank you, Gregorio.  I will be there September 29th through October the 1st at the Tampa Improv.  And I'll be on Leno this Wednesday night doing my piece for Fashion Week.  It's the longest shoot I've done for them.  Four days.  Jesus.  A lot of hours.  So hopefully it will go well. 
[03:06:30]  I'm sorry.  Thursday I'm doing G4.  Oh, wow.  Attack of the Show.  Nice.  Yes.  Yeah, I've never watched it.  I heard it's really good.  The host is supposed to be very good.  Try Secrets of Google Earth.  Sam.  Did you try that one yet?  And that's on YouTube, too.  Well, what do you want?  A video, a picture, or a website?  That's up to you.  Ah, see?  Now it's your call.  It's your call.  What are you going to do?  What does Sam do?  Oh, I've got to see a video here.  Mini Riot in downtown Minneapolis caught on video after a dance party in downtown Minneapolis 
[03:07:00]  Saturday night causing wild scenes on busy streets.  Let's see the video.  Yeah, it's probably just a bunch of people dancing.  Probably a bunch of people in bobby socks.  Oh, well, look at that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Well.  Isn't that a shame?  These secrets suck, Sam.  There's no secrets.  Where are the secrets?  Yeah.  There are no secrets.  There's a pyramid.  What are the... 
[03:07:30]  This is fucking horrendous.  Boy, these young teens or whatever you want to call them.  Is that what they're calling them, young teens?  They're not saying what they are, who they are, where they're from.  But they are getting raucous.  A lot of fighting.  A lot of chair throwing.  Wow.  A lot of bullshit.  Oh, I love the comments.  Nothing beats the comments after watching a video like that of a flash mob or some teens  gone wild.  Are they calling them teens?  No, they called them something else in the comments section. 
[03:08:00]  First graders.  I'll tell you that much.  Wow.  And numerous times.  They get very creative in the comments sections.  Yep.  So that was...  Well, why don't we leave with the Stevie Wonder Metallica thing?  Did you get it right, Sam?  I have no idea.  I just threw out two songs.  Sabatru and...  Isn't she lovely?  No idea.  That seems impossible.  It really does.  Okay.  It has to be Enter Sandman with something. 
[03:08:30]  Enter Sandman and you can feel it all over.  Wait, what's his big...  What song is that?  Oh, what about the one with the fucking talking about the...  Oh, maybe Faith to Black?  For the City.  Yeah.  Just Enough for the City.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just Enough for the City.  I'm going to go with Superstitious.  I'm sorry. 
[03:09:00]  Superstitious is what I was doing.  Could be that one.  Doing Superstitious and I'm doing Enter Sandman.  Could be that one.  Oh, wow.  That's a new technique.  A guy with a whip and a chair is actually trying to control the crowd.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Good night.  Is that a Sad but True?  Is that a Sad but True?  Oh, fuck.  What's the one for Stevie?  Wait, did you know the answer to this?  No, I swear to you.  What's your Stevie song?  I said Sad but True and Isn't She Lovely, the first one. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, fuck.  Okay.  I'm out.  Okay.  You're still in.  Very superstitious.  No, you're not.  Superstitious.  Fuck.  But I didn't get those fucking sandwiches.  All right.  No, no, no.  We both get partial credit.  Shit.  Yeah.  I said that.  I didn't.  I did.  We're going to play this.  It's pretty cool, actually.  And we'll see you guys tomorrow.  Merry superstitious. 
[03:10:00]  Very superstitious.  Writings on the wall  There is some stitches 
[03:10:30]  Letters not to fall  Pregnant one's own recipe  Broke the looking glass  Seven years of bad luck  Your good things in your past  When you believe in things 
[03:11:00]  That you don't understand  Then you suffer  Superstitious way  There is superstitious  Watch your face and hands 
[03:11:30]  Let me go to the bottom  Do all that you can  Keep me in daydream  Keep me going strong  You don't want to save me  Sad is all 
[03:12:00]  Sad is all  When you believe in things  You don't understand  Then you suffer  Superstitious way  I'm your dream  I'm your eyes 
[03:12:30]  I'm your pain  I'm your dream  I'm your eyes  I'm your pain  I'm your pain  You know it says you're true  Very superstitious 
[03:13:00]  Nothing more to say  Very superstitious  The devil's on his way  Reaching my soul, baby  It's a given race  Seven years of bad luck 
[03:13:30]  The devil's on his way  The things in your past  You believe in your past  And you believe in things  That you don't understand  Then you suffer  I'll tell you what the best hour of every show is  10 o'clock  10 o'clock  Yes  Thank you  Thank you very much  I appreciate you 
[03:14:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show  On the virus  Sirius XM  The virus  Sirius XM  Hey, hey, hey  And now  The Opie and Anthony Show  Continues  This is After ONA Live  Here's your host  Sam Roberts  We're all still here  It's After Opie and Anthony Live  And I'm Sam Roberts  The boys have left  Opie, Anthony, Jim  They're all gone  They were out of here 
[03:14:30]  Before that song was even over  The, what was it  Stevie Wonder Metallica mashup  That we ended with  Yeah, they didn't even wait  For the end of the song  They were out of here  That's just a ploy  Is what they do  For those of you  Who haven't figured it out yet  And if you haven't  I don't know where you've been  But Opie sees a four minute song  Sitting in front of him  And he realizes  That that means  Everybody gets to go home  Four minutes earlier  Yay  I do have to say  That was nice of Ant  To plug how much he loves  The 10 o'clock hour again  Before he left 
[03:15:00]  Well, I was gonna say  This is great news  Right now  That music means  Great things for Anthony  Even more exciting  Than getting to leave  Early because of the song  They played  Ant now  Gets to listen to his  Very favorite part  Of the show  Now, I mean  We've heard him reference  The after show before  You know  Sure, he'll take  You know  He'll take jabs here and there  Poke fun  Is what I call it  Without really meaning it 
[03:15:30]  You know what I mean  The way kind of your  Big brother  Or best friend might  But he always knows  The details of what happened  And today on the show  Not this show  The Opie and Anthony show  He really let his feelings  Be known about the after show  I think  He went back  And claimed that  He didn't really mean it  Pips  The run of Vez intern  Did you hear it?  I didn't hear it  But I'm just laughing  At the idea of him  Trashing the show  No, no, no  No, he didn't  Let me see  Find a pair of headphones 
[03:16:00]  Because Pips  I want you to hear this  Because this is what  I'm aiming at  Just in case there's  Anybody out there  Who didn't hear it  It was very nice today  Anthony  From the Opie and Anthony show  Legendary broadcaster  I mean this is a  Top tier morning show  And Anthony's name  Is in the title  So this is Anthony  And his opinions  Of this  After Opie and Anthony live  I'll tell you what  The best hour of every show  Is the 10 o'clock  Yes  Thank you  Thank you very much  I appreciate that  What else is there to say 
[03:16:30]  I don't know man  It sounded kind of sarcastic  No, no, no, no, no  Eric  Tell me this  Eric  No, it was very sincere  That he loved the 10 a.m. hour  He said he loved  Paul  You were on the phones today, right?  Oh, absolutely  He loves the 10 o'clock hour  That's what he said, Pips  But why?  What's his reasoning?  I guess he just likes to listen to it  See, he didn't say why  I mean  Why would  I'm not a guy  Pips  I'm not a guy  Who sits there  And needs his ego  Stroked  Who's just looking for more compliments 
[03:17:00]  By the way  How do you think I look today?  Do I look good?  I'm a guy  I'm not supposed to tell you  But I mean  I look alright, right?  Anyway  I'm not always looking for compliments  That's a very nice shirt  Thank you so much, Eric  I'm not always looking for compliments  Paul, you find this entertaining, right?  Of course  Thank you, Paul  I'm not always looking for compliments  Everywhere I go  So I'm not going to sit there  Sam, have you lost weight?  Thank you, Eric  Thank you for noticing  I have been running a little more  And watching what I eat  But that's besides the point  What I was saying, Pips  Is I'm not somebody 
[03:17:30]  Who's always looking to get compliments  Right  But  So I'm not going to sit there  When Ant says  That his favorite part  Of his own show  Is the after show  I'm not going to sit there  And say  Why?  What do you like about it?  I'm going to sit  I'm going to be  You know  A gentleman  I'm going to accept the compliment  And move on  As a matter of fact, Eric  Why don't we hear that clip again?  Why don't we play it one more time?  I'll tell you what the best hour  Of every show is  10 o'clock  Yes  Thank you  Thank you very much  I appreciate you  See what I mean?  I'm just going to throw it out there 
[03:18:00]  Maybe  Just maybe  Okay, Pips  The Ron and Fez intern  He just likes 10 o'clock  Because he's not here  He left already  I don't see that as a possibility  Why you got to rain on his parade?  I don't even  That doesn't even make sense to me  Because Ant loves to broadcast  And so he's probably thinking to himself  As much as I've loved  Each and every show that I've done  And as much of a good time  As I've had doing them  I actually like listening to the after show  Even more  Which to me  Is just such an honor to hear  But you don't stroke your ego  You're not one of those guys  I'm not a guy 
[03:18:30]  That's here to stroke my ego  Well, apparently he doesn't have to  Yeah  I mean, people are here to compliment me  But that's not something I'm here to point out  Well, maybe we need to hear it again  I mean, in case somebody didn't hear it  You're the producer  In case you missed it  Hear it  Eric, the producer  Wants to make sure everybody heard it  Let's make sure everybody heard it  I'll tell you what the best hour of every show is  10 o'clock  Yes  Thank you  Thank you very much  I appreciate you  I don't know why he said it, Opie  I guess it's because  It's true  I mean, that's the only explanation  Well, what happened after that clip?  Where's the aftermath of that? 
[03:19:00]  Well, then they went on for hours  I mean, it's a long show  Uh-huh  You know what I mean?  We can't play  This is after Opie and Anthony Live  I think they went on to Troy after that  Okay  Yeah, they did something with Troy  About how they, you know  I don't know what they did  But all I remember  Uh-huh  Off the top of my head  Is them talking about how much they like this show  So, you know, I have to say  Thank you to Anthony  And at the same time  You're welcome to Anthony  For giving him all this  And you're welcome to all of you  Well, you know what's nice?  Because he gives you that nice compliment 
[03:19:30]  That he likes listening to your hour here  But he was also the one that gave you permission  To do whatever you want  He did?  Yeah  Do you have any proof?  Uh, yeah  Take a listen to this  The Sam Roberts show  Can do whatever it wants  Oh, really?  Yeah, I don't care  That's great  And he gave me that permission  He gave me  He gave me, uh  The rope to do what I wish with it  He said the Sam Roberts show  Is this a different show?  Is this a show I never heard of before?  Because I know this is the after show  Every show is the Sam Roberts show  Oh, every show is the Sam Roberts show  Well, I mean 
[03:20:00]  I think it's just his  You know, the show's technically called  After Opie and Anthony Live  But a lot of kids  Like your age  Like when they're just hanging out  Yeah  They go, oh, you mean Sam Roberts  Yeah, the Sam Roberts show  Yeah, that's kind of like the  Kind of cool abbreviation type of thing  Uh-huh  You know, that's kind of what the young people  Are saying in the streets right now  I'm with the young people  I'm on the streets  I've not heard that once  Well, maybe you hang out with like geeks or something  I don't know if you hang out with nerds  But I know  Not at all  You apparently haven't been paying attention  I guess I haven't  Because, I mean  I don't know if you heard  Last week  I mean, Zack Ryder was on the show 
[03:20:30]  Uh-huh  So, I mean  I know that there's a big buzz  In that sort of whole  I mean  I'm  I know what the kids are saying, okay  I work on Hits 1  You work  Hello  You do work on Hits 1  I'll give you that  And that's what the kids are listening to  Am I right?  You're right  You're all just sitting there  Hanging out  Listening to Lady Gaga  And whatnot  Adele  I know  I know  You know what I mean?  And just because  You know  And I liked it  Ant said such nice things about me  I don't know why you have to try to tear me down  I'm not trying to tear you down  I mean 
[03:21:00]  I'm just very surprised  That he would say something like that  I'm looking  Why would you be surprised?  Why would you be surprised?  I mean, a lot of people  Are a fan of the after show  Yeah, no  I love the show  I think it's a great show  So then why so surprised  When Anthony talks about how great it is?  Because they trash you before that  Not that day  Think about it  Like Ant likes Fios, right?  Okay  So he sits there  And talks about how great Fios is  Yeah  Ant likes this show  So he sits there  And talks about how great it is  He gets into detail about Fios  He will give you an hour of Fios  Well again, I didn't want to  Rely too heavily on the clips  You know  His love for this show 
[03:21:30]  Might be as much as his love for his guns  It seemed that way to me  It did  Listen to that clip  It seemed that way  I mean, again  I'm not the type of guy  To go on and on and on  And somebody, you know  Says nice things about me  I like to just let it sit there  And then move on  You know, it's been a couple minutes  Maybe some people haven't heard it  I'll tell you this, Eric  I've heard that a new audience  Gets picked up every 30 seconds  So maybe it is important  That we play the clip  To bring everybody on board  With what we're talking about  Go ahead and roll it  I'll tell you what the best hour 
[03:22:00]  Of every show is  The 10 o'clock  Yes  Thank you  Thank you very much  I appreciate you  Well, there you go  Pips, I mean  I must be crazy  You know what I'm saying  You're right  I'm crazy  I don't know what I'm talking about  Alright, well  Hopefully you can get your head together  For Ron and Fez today  I hope so  Because I know they're relying on you  Yeah  Do you guys have new interns coming in?  I think maybe tomorrow  Eric, do we have interns in tomorrow?  I believe one starts tomorrow  We're going to have an intern in here tomorrow?  And then we're waiting on one more  They're waiting 
[03:22:30]  He didn't fill out the papers in time  So we've got to wait a few days  Why would you pick him?  You couldn't even fill out the papers  I didn't pick him  Alright  Oh boy  Who picked him?  Other people  Oh my gosh  You can't even say who they are?  You've got corporate on me, Eric  Do you want to hear that clip again, Sam?  No, we're done with the clip  People get it by now  But we're actually going to  Oh, and that's it?  We have two interns?  Yeah, for this semester we have two interns  Except one of them hasn't filled out the paperwork yet  Yeah, we're just waiting, I guess, on a background check 
[03:23:00]  Oh, Jesus  Oh, no  This can't be good  Wow, so there's going to be an intern here tomorrow  Can we have him, like, do whatever we want  And do crazy stunts  And throw him down flights of stairs and whatnot  Well, we can't throw him  Okay  We can't do things to him physically  Like, pull out his arm hairs and stuff like that?  Well, you know, that's within reason  Depending on how he feels on the air at that particular point  Hey, we've got this new band called pulling out arm hairs 
[03:23:30]  Yeah, but, you know, they'll be here to assist in the daily operations of the show  Both on air and behind the scenes  Oh, my God  This is going to be so exciting  Well, Eric, today was a big day for the show  Tomorrow's, I think, going to be even bigger with the return of interns  Because this is a...  Last time we had interns was December, wasn't it?  Yeah, right before Christmas  This is nine months in the making  I mean, this is going to be big  And as much as ONA have complained about not having interns 
[03:24:00]  They're going to be complaining about something else tomorrow  But it won't be the intern thing  They might be complaining about this show  I mean, that would be very strange to people, I feel like  Because then it's like, well, which one do we take?  Are they going to complain about it or are they going to love it?  Because today, all Ant was doing was sitting here all day  Singing the praises of the after show  We do have a new audience in case you need to refresh their memory  For a minute, I wanted to be like, Ant  Like, I understand how much you like the after show  But you've got to do your own show, too, man 
[03:24:30]  There's, you know, there's listeners for Opie and Anthony  That want to hear, not just...  Yeah, play the clip  So everybody's on board  I'll tell you what the best time of every show is  The 10 o'clock  Yes  Thank you  Thank you very much  I appreciate you  I mean, it is what it is  You know what I mean?  Read it and weep, pips  Read it and weep  I don't know what I'm talking about, Sam  You obviously don't  I don't  After hearing the clip  After hearing the clip, I must be crazy  37 times  Do you get it now?  I think I got it  Okay, good  Fantastic, because the last thing I wanted to do was play the clip again 
[03:25:00]  Because I wouldn't want people to think we're repetitive here on After Opie and Anthony Live  You know that, Paul?  It's so important in radio  To be original, spontaneous, and not to be repetitive  The last thing you want to do is be repetitive  You hear me?  Yeah, I hear you  Don't be repetitive  But, you know, every 30 seconds you get a new audience  Well, then I'm telling them not to be repetitive  Fair enough  Where'd Eric go?  Oh, he was answering some calls  Everybody's calling in thinking, oh, am I going to get through to talk to Sam?  Well, it's a very popular show 
[03:25:30]  I guess it is  It's good that you mentioned that  I'm going to  All right, here's what I'm going to do  I'm going to go to one phone call to test the waters  I've done it before  And that could be it  Because, Pips, you know this  Yeah  I generally don't go to phone calls  You don't?  On this show  No, no  Art in Pennsylvania  Hey, Sam  Yeah  I just wanted to comment that, you know, I consider yourself to be a pretty smart guy  Thank you  A good reporter of the field  Oh, thank you so much  Thank you 
[03:26:00]  Don't you think that, like, one of the qualities of being a good reporter is to understand the context of a statement  And ask follow-up questions in regards to the context of the statement to make sure that you report it accurately  I guess I thought that Ant's comment was so compact, self-explanatory, and in no need of further explanation  That I thought it was good enough to just sit on its own and move on to the next topic  It's funny, because that's what I thought  But only you thought that 
[03:26:30]  Oh, well, I'm sorry about that then, Art  I guess I gotta  That kind of sounds just a smid self-serving  Well, look, I mean, if you want the full context, the replay starts at 3 p.m.  But at this point, I don't even think you need the full context, because I think it was summed up very well here  But maybe you're right, Art  Maybe I do need to do a better job of putting myself in the listener's shoes when I'm hosting After Open Anthony Live here  Because I think you have to consider any legal ramifications that may come for this 
[03:27:00]  Wouldn't that be great?  That would be  You may have to actually pay Ant for an endorsement  That would be the most  I think he should be paid for this  That would be the most ingenious publicity stunt  If Ant actually sued me  And we went to court, as in Anthony from Opie and Anthony  Sues his producer, Sam Roberts, from his after show  Howard's suing XM, so why not?  I don't know anything about that 
[03:27:30]  But thank you, Art  I appreciate it  I think Ant should do it  I think he should sue me  And hopefully, we'll get some ink for both our shows  You know what I mean?  I just have a feeling the judge might just throw that one out  Just thinking about it  Not before the headlines hit  Pips, not before the headlines hit  That's why you're the host, Sam  You're smarter than me  That's right, Pips  Dave in Tennessee  I'm going to go to you next  Dave, you're on the after show  I'm not going to go to calls all day, Paul  I'm going to take a couple calls  And I'm going to move forward  Because that's what we do  We're always moving here  Always moving  Dave in Tennessee 
[03:28:00]  Hey, good morning, Sam  I was wondering if you could help settle a bet  Sure  I was wondering what is Anthony's favorite hour of the show  Okay  Now, a lot of people  This is  A lot of people are questioning this lately  No ego, though  No ego  No ego, no  But a lot of people have been wondering that  Like, Dave  Some might say like  8 o'clock  Or even 9 o'clock  I know he probably  Maybe 6 o'clock  Because the tiredness hasn't hit him yet  7 could be 
[03:28:30]  Eric, could you help Dave out?  Because he needs to know  He wants to settle a bet  What's Ant's favorite hour?  I was looking through some audio  I think Ant actually answered that on the air  Oh, wow  Okay, let's play it  I'll tell you what the best hour of every show is  10 o'clock  10 o'clock  Yes  Thank you  Thank you very much  Wow  Who would have thought?  It's this hour, Dave  According to that clip  It's this hour  I hope you won  I sure did  Thank you, Sam  Yes  Thank you, Dave  Making dreams come true 
[03:29:00]  Here on After Open Anthony Live  With Sam Roberts  What an incredible day this is  And Eric  I want to thank you  For doing a hell of a job  As a producer  Finding that clip  No problem, Sam  I mean, you did a great job  And Pips  Yeah  I'm glad you came here  With your learning head on  I know  And I hope  That you're going to walk away  A little bit wiser  Sam  You're like my Buddha  You're like my Confucius  I learn all from you  Except a little more sexual, right?  Like a little  I guess  I get that vibe sometimes  A little  It's like Buddha  But it's a little bit sexual 
[03:29:30]  It was a big day  For Open Anthony, though  We can't just sit here  Singing my praises all day  Quiet down, everybody  Quiet down  I'm going to try to move on  With the show  I know you'd be satisfied with it  But we're going to try  To keep things a little more open  Because Tyra Banks  Came on the Open Anthony show today  What?  That's right  I know  Eric, you were just sitting there  Playing the clip of Anthony  How much he likes the 10 o'clock hour  Over and over again  I must have missed it  Which, you know, I'm fine with 
[03:30:00]  But yeah  Tyra Banks  Was on the show today  Open Anthony has now started  A great tradition, I think  Of  I mean, completely smashing people  To smithereens  And still having them in studio  Whoopi Goldberg  Was the start, I think  I mean  I guess technically the first  Was Sarah Jessica Parker  Way back in the day  But she wasn't in studio  She called in  But it's like  There aren't that many shows  Where they spend so much time  Just obliterating a person 
[03:30:30]  Like we did to Tyra Banks  And then ending up  Having them in studio  Because on O&A  We like to  Kind of  Latch on to one thing  For a period of time  And just pull  All the funny out of it  At their expense  And I mean  The show does a great job of that  So we did  When Whoopi Goldberg  Started in radio  We smashed her show  To smithereens  I mean  Every day  For the first week  Of her show  We were just playing  Her show  And just talking about 
[03:31:00]  What a horrible  Horrible job  She was doing  Until  She came into the studio  Eric Logan brought her in  Wasn't she waiting  For you guys  At like  The other studio  When you were  She wasn't  She wasn't waiting  But  Right after we got  To the studio  It was when we went  To K-Rock  We walked over  To the 57th street studio  At XM  And  Literally  Ten minutes into the show  Probably  The show was just going on  And she walked right in  And we go  Oh no  It's Academy Award 
[03:31:30]  Did she win?  I know she was nominated  I think she won  Did she win Eric?  Do you know?  I don't know  Pips  Did Whoopi Goldberg win an award?  I have no idea  Where are you  With me Pips?  You're supposed to be  With me today  So Whoopi Goldberg  Next  Of course  More recently  Was the man himself  Larry King  After years of abuse  I mean  I would sit there  Watching  The majority  Of Larry King's shows  And just pulling out  And it really wouldn't be that tough  Every 
[03:32:00]  Day  There'd be something  To pull out of Larry King's show  For us to just  Smash him  Talk about how he shouldn't be  On television anymore  Talk about how he shouldn't be  Breathing anymore  Just say horrible  And terrible things  About the man  Until  He came into the studio  And we  We had a nice appearance  With him  Now Tyra  Tyra we haven't messed  With in a while  But during the K-Rock days  We destroyed Tyra  We would play clips  Of her show 
[03:32:30]  At least  Probably twice a week  We had the  Panty party drop  We had the  Kiss my fat ass drop  We had it all  And today  We had the woman  Herself in studio  Now  I will say  To Obi and Anthony's credit  We only had her  For ten minutes today  We didn't really have time  Because  Because the idea  Would be  Like when we had  Whoopi in  When we had Larry King in  It's to sit down  Talk to them  Let them feel comfortable  Because we're not  Trying to attack somebody  Once they come in the studio 
[03:33:00]  Unless  They need it  As was the case  With Paris Hilton  For instance  But  You know  Make them feel comfortable  And then  Kind of bring up  All the times  We said that they should  Retire from their jobs  As entertainers  In a jovial way  So it's like  Oh yeah  Remember we were just  Busting balls  Even though it was  Like wishing death  We were just like  Oh yeah  Just busting balls  Now we only had Tyra  For ten minutes  And  Unlike Whoopi Goldberg  And Larry King  Tyra  As Obi said  At the beginning  Of the interview 
[03:33:30]  Is really fucking hot  Yes  That's how  Once Obi started  The interview  And  As much as  Obi and Anthony  Have a history  Of  Tackling  The people  That they've made fun of  Having them in studio  And bringing everything  Full circle  They also have a history  Of turning googly eyed  When a pretty girl  Walks in here  So  Those two worlds  Came  Crashing together today  And  Obi brought up  The banner here and there  And did bring up  Tyra making it  About herself  So those are  The criticisms 
[03:34:00]  That we brought up  In the past  And they did bring them up  Because for those  That don't know  When Tyra was doing  Her show  And this was a few  Years ago  When she was still  Doing it out of LA  A bunch of our fans  They called themselves  At the time  The Pests Out West  Which rhymes  In California  The Pests Out West  Commissioned  This giant banner  That said  Tyra Banks  Is a fatty pig  Fatty  P.O.W.  Pests Out West  Obi and Anthony show  And they hung it 
[03:34:30]  In front of her TV studio  And this thing  Ended up on  Gawker  And Defamer  And E  E News  Put it on their TV show  So I mean  It was a big deal  At the time  And I think  Obi was trying  To get at that  I  Tried to see  On her way out  If I could  Get anything  Out of Tyra  Or at least  Find out if she knew  Because  We don't even know  If she knew  The extent to which  Obi and Anthony  Mocked her  Horribly  On this show  So while she was  Walking down the hall 
[03:35:00]  Because literally  She was in this studio  For ten minutes  And then her five people  That were with her  Whisked her  Out of the building  I mean she was not  Sticking around  For any more bullshit  Here at SiriusXM  But I'm sure she'll be back  To do the other shows  But um  Here it is  This is my  Exit interview with Tyra  Now the audio  Isn't quite up to  The standards of  My usual recording  And that's because  The external mic  Failed on this  One instance  Uh that's right  Machine error 
[03:35:30]  Not operator error  So with that  Keep that in mind  But this is uh  Tyra as she exited  The SiriusXM facility  Tyra you were just  On the Opie and Anthony show  What was the experience  Like for you?  I thought it was  Really great  I um  A lot of energy  Funny boys  Funny funny boys  Did you know  Opie and Anthony  Beforehand?  Yes I did  So do you know  How much time  Opie and Anthony  Spent playing clips  Of your talk show  They didn't really  Man up and tell you  About it while you  Were standing in front  Oh no I didn't  Know that  Yo they spent 
[03:36:00]  Hours playing clips  Of your talk show  Of course like you  Said we have to do  This show every day  But um  We probably played  The pain party drop  Over and over again  We played clips  From the homeless  We played clips  Of just about every  Show you ever did  Uh the criticisms  Do you take it  As a compliment  Do you like the  Publicity or uh  Or do you wish  That they just  Shut their mouths  Oh no  I mean I  Studied marketing  You know  Love hate  As long as  You know  Interested in it  I think if everything  Is too PGP  And she's like  La la la 
[03:36:30]  Then you're not  Really being effective  And people don't  Really care  And real quick  The banner that  Opie was talking  About was uh  It was a critical  Banner of yours  That somebody put up  Uh while you were  Doing the show  In front of the TV  Studio  Do you remember  That at all  So she doesn't  Remember the banner  Now I was a little  Surprised  And I was kind  Of getting the vibe  That's why I kind  Of was talking  A little bit  That uh  I thought that  She would have  Realized how often 
[03:37:00]  We played her clips  Cause I would feel  Like maybe if we  Did it every now  And then  Not so much  But the fact  That who's that guy  Dressed as kiss  Outside my window  Who is that guy  Who's the guy  Dressed as kiss  Come in here  There's a guy  Walked by  Just dressed as kiss  Who is that guy  JTX in the house  What up  What up  What up  JTX  The banner  Why you dressed up  As kiss  Any of the  It was a wild night  Oh my god  How you doing

[03:41:00]  Hard rock grunge  You're supposed to be  Hanging out with the kids  Kids don't listen to  Hard rock and grunge anymore  What is this 1995 grunge  That was my shit back in the day  What day  The 90s  You're 12  I'm 25 man  He's 25  Oh wow  Yeah  You're an old man  I am an old man  You do look young  I know  You're 25  I go to the movie theaters  I get carded  All that shit man  You do you get carded  At the movie theaters  At the movie theaters  For like an R rated movie  Yes  So like they think you're 16  Of course  And trying to get into  The 18 plus  Yeah  And I always look at them  Like how old do you think I am 
[03:41:30]  Oh you look kind of like  15 16  Travis do you remember  When you and I  Looked young for our ages  Yeah  And then this show  Really fucking  Really  Caught that up for us  Didn't it  Sure did  Like they used to be like  Oh there's no way  He's over 18  And now I look at  Opie's stupid  YouTube video commenters  And they're like  Sam  I'm 40 years old  And I look younger than him  What the fuck  Does he look so old from  It's from this show  Okay  And that's why Pips  I would say  Get out while you still  Have your youth  Because Mark Zito 
[03:42:00]  Has been here for what  Eight months  And he's aged nine years  You've been here for a year  Oh my god  So yeah  He's aged about 12 years  So I mean  I would say this is not  A place you want to be in  To keep your youth alive  I'll keep that in mind  Yeah  Yeah  But I was saying  Before we were rudely  Interrupted by JTX  That  About Tyra Banks  Oh yeah  I was surprised  That she didn't realize  That we talked about her  A whole lot  Because I would think  That if you were doing  A talk show 
[03:42:30]  And like  Opie and Anthony's show  Is in the top  Five radio shows  In the world  Yeah  Probably top two  I mean there's not  In radio  Especially talk shows  There's not a whole lot  Of shows that are more  Relevant than this show  And the amount of time  We spent on  Not only satellite radio  But also  National satellite radio  And syndicated broadcast radio  Terrestrial  That you would think  That she'd be more aware  Of what was going on  Unless she was aware 
[03:43:00]  And she was pretending  She didn't know  But I got the vibe  From her that like  When she found out  That we spent a lot of time  Talking about her  It got a little more uneasy  Like she was like  Oh  Like is this one of the shows  That made fun of me  All the time  And I didn't even know it  But you know  I don't know  Where did Eric go?  He went  Where did he go?  Eric has a meeting upstairs  A meeting upstairs?  Is he getting fired?  One can hope  One can only hope  Is Troy around?  Because I know Roland  I wanted to talk to Roland 
[03:43:30]  About how he thought  The  What's it called  Went  The Tyra Banks interview went  But I think he went  Walking with Opie  I see Troy walking down the hall  Troy was another star  Of the show today  Man  JTX is just in here  He's a singer  He's a pop star  I have no idea  He's big on  On  Hits one  I do  Travis  I don't know  I know you're more like  I have no idea  You don't know who he is  But do you  Well I listened to  About 30 seconds of  Love in America  Put it on  Just now  You want it on?  Put it on for the people 
[03:44:00]  And we'll talk over it  So it doesn't  Is it  This is JTX  This is the guy  Who's just in here  He didn't sound like that  I hate it  You don't like it  I absolutely hate it  I can tell you right  He's like small though  For a pop star  He was a little man  Like tiny  Like when I see people  They're like  My size or smaller  Who are like  Pop stars like this  I think like  What the fuck am I doing here  Interviewing you  I'm bigger than you  Physically 
[03:44:30]  It seems like  You should be a certain size  To be a pop star  Especially since  He looked all young  And he was  Here  This is the hook  Paul  Love in America  He was just on the show  Folks  JTX  I don't think any man  Can actually like this song  No  Pipsy listen for a second  That was a little rough man  Okay Travis  What  Thumbs up or down on this song 
[03:45:00]  Nah I've heard it before  And  No I mean I've heard  This song before  Oh  This is the exact song  Yeah like last year  Trazen hair  That's already coming in here  What's he hiding for  I gotta get his opinion  On this song  Because  Paul you just said  No man can like this  You don't think it's like  Snappy  Snow cones  I wouldn't  You wouldn't  No  South Detroit  Look we don't play a lot of songs  On Hits 1  So I tend to  Memorize them quickly  I don't mind the song  It's alright  It's alright right 
[03:45:30]  It's fine  It's pretty good  It's just easy  You know what I mean  Yeah it's like a nice old pop song  Yeah I am  Singing about the IHOP song  I'm feeling that new  LMFAO song  Party Rock  Or the new one  The new new one  Because like Party Rock is like  You know Party Rock by LMFAO  It's the one the hamsters  Are on the commercial with it now  Like I knew Party  Like even Pips  You know Party Rock  Like I knew Party Rock  Was past the point of the kids  When I went to Amish country  For when we were on vacation  And I got on a buggy ride  With a family from like Long Island  And this big giant mother 
[03:46:00]  Of the family  She's a big fat woman  Who's in her 40s  Her phone starts ringing  And it just goes  Every day I'm shuffling  And I go alright  If the moms have it  It's their ringtones  Yeah  The song's kind of done  Isn't it  Yeah but the new one  I think is funny  I think they're cool  They're cool dudes  They're funny guys  Yeah see at first  I thought they were like  A joke band  So I was like  There's no way  This is gonna  See this is Party Rock  There's a new one  Get down with this Paul  You can't get down with this  No this is alright  You know what 
[03:46:30]  The kids still like to dance  To this one  I know I love dancing  You can't help but dance  To this song  But what's the new one  The sexy one  I'm sexy I know  Or something  Yeah yeah yeah  That's a great song  The one they go  I work out  Yeah  It's funny  He's lyrically  Saying some funny shit  It takes a lot of  I listen to the words  In pop songs sometimes  And I think to myself  What a pair of balls  It takes to write that  On a piece of paper  And call it a song  Yeah  Like you got the music  And you're like  This song needs lyrics  And this guy goes  How about I'm running  Through these hoes  Like Drano  But you know  The funny thing  About pop music  What? 
[03:47:00]  Pop music  You can't overthink things  No  It just has to be simple  That anybody can digest  And that's what makes it good  Yeah they're like  What's the hook of this song  And they're like  How about Party Rock  Is in the house tonight  Yeah  And you're like  I don't know what it means  But by the time the song hits  The kids will  Yeah  Do you ever see what these guys look like?  Yeah  They're funny looking  They're goofballs  They got one of them  Has hair like me almost  Yeah  And they wore silly glasses  And one of them  Was wearing chaps  At the VMAs  But even like  The production value  Of their songs  Is really good  This is your song?  Yeah I'm feeling this one right now 
[03:47:30]  This makes you feel a little sexy  Yeah  It does  It's just  It's funny  You kind of get dressed  To this song  Like put on a vest  This isn't like pop  This is more like  It's electro  But it's crossing over  Into that pop world  You see  Yeah a lot of dance music  Starting to cross over  Into pop  Yeah  I know Travis  Is a big LMFAO guy  They opened for Pearl Jam  Right?  No  Oh I got it wrong  I guess  You like this?  I'm feeling it dude  This is my favorite part  Because you see 
[03:48:00]  What he's doing there  Is he's explaining  Why his body is attractive  He's like  Hey check it out  Like Paul  Like you wouldn't sit there  With your shirt off  Swinging your shirt over your head  Like and think girls  Would be like  Damn look at him  No not really my style  You know why  Because you don't work out  Like if some girl  Came up to you  And was like  Oh why do I like  Like your body so much  You would reply  I work out  Right?  I don't think that would  Come in my mouth  Troy's feeling sexy  I'm just  I'm feeling this tune man  This is hot  Now uh 
[03:48:30]  Troy  You were a star  On the show today  Well  I don't know about that  I mean you had  A strong segment  I would say  Because Opie  Used some audio  From the after show  From last week  Yeah  When you and Francine  Got into a fight  By the way  I mean  We  I  People were  Upset  That I ended the show  In the middle of the fight  But like literally  That's when the show  Has to end  Yeah  It's not like  It's not like I made the call  To say alright  That's enough of this  Because I would have  Had that go on  For 17 hours 
[03:49:00]  If I could have  Yeah  I would listen to it all day  Like I would sit here  And just watch you and Francine  Squabble  Without a care in the world  You live for those moments  That's it  That's all I want to see  Is like people  Fighting with each other  With passion  Right  I like passion  And emotion  Right  And it feels real to me  And certainly  Your fight with Francine  Was major  But today  And that's when  You dropped the bomb  That you  Fuck plastic  Toys  Right  Did you ever 
[03:49:30]  Have said  Because you  You said on the show today  That you  You used the blue mermaid  Right  Which is  If you google image it  It's a  It's a vagina  Type thing  That you would hold  In your hand  But it is  It's like jelly  Is it like one of those things  That you buy at the  Science museum  That kind of slides up  And down your hand  No that's more like  Balloon like  Okay  This is more like  I don't really know  How to describe it  Just more jelly  And then if you  If you bring it in the shower  And it gets warm  It feels like a vag  Where have you thrown it  In the microwave  I don't know if you could do that 
[03:50:00]  It's not microwavable  I wouldn't trust it  You throw lube in it  Or you use it as is  I mean if it's in the shower  It's  Keep in mind  I haven't done this  In quite some time  Yeah whatever  No I don't get it fucked up  I'm not above it  I'm not above it  You just can't find it  No no I just  Before I had a hook up  At an adult store  Where I could get them for free  I just can't go in  And throw down 50 bucks  On a jerk off tube  You know what I mean  Yeah you got  Times are tough  Times are real fucking tough  You know times are tough  We're in a recession  You can't just be buying  Blue mermaids  To jack yourself off with 
[03:50:30]  You got a hand  Right  What else are you going to do  I didn't keep the electric on  I can't buy jerk off toys  Exactly  Your hand is free  Right  And you can use it all day  Yeah exactly  As much as you want  Exactly  What else have you used  Other than the blue mermaid  Well as I said before  There was the electro hand job  What's the electro  Google  Now this is  This is going back to like  The late 90s  Early 2000s  You don't have to explain yourself  Well I don't even know  If they make it anymore  There should still be a picture  And there's  Is that a guy on the box  Yeah no there it is  Yep  Oh that's it  Yeah that's it  That's actually a hand  Yeah  It doesn't  Well that's  Is there a man on the box though 
[03:51:00]  That seems like it's targeted  Towards gay men  That seems like a man's hand  Well I mean if you close  The one I had was a woman's hand  Are you sure  Were the nails painted  No you could just tell  It was effeminate  Were the nails painted  No it was the flesh color  Okay I don't think  That was a female's hand  I think that was a fake guy's hand  Then I fucked up  Whatever dude  It was the 90s  Yeah  We were all fucking crazy  Alright well  What was funny though  Was instead of  We focused a little bit  On your sexual activity 
[03:51:30]  With plastic toys  But it ended up  Going straight into  An argument over  Whether or not  You were a hipster  Right  You don't consider yourself  A hipster  Well I mean right now  I'm wearing a sheer terror shirt  I don't know what that means  It's a New York City  Hardcore band  And they're a legendary  Hardcore band  I saw them yesterday  Is the hardcore scene  Still alive and kicking?  I don't see as much  Of it lately  Well this band has been around  Since the late 80s  Yeah  So you know  They came back  They got back together  So I'm just excited  That they're playing again  But are people still  Still rocking it?  Yeah absolutely 
[03:52:00]  It's also happening  A lot more  Where the older bands  Are coming out  I know VOD played recently  They've been working up  For a few years  Yeah I mean  Because a lot of  These hardcore bands  Weren't making anything  And nobody cared about them  And then all of a sudden  So it's like VOD  Shear Terror  JTX  Like they're starting  Yeah exactly  The hardcore bands  Are starting to get together  Yeah  But do you consider yourself  A hipster?  I mean look  I guess does any hipster  Consider themselves a hipster?  I don't know  Probably not  But you know  It's just  My argument to them  Was you know  If you take that same guy  And you put a black 
[03:52:30]  Sabbath shirt on  Then all of a sudden  You know  Everybody would think  He was fucking great  But it's like  Why  Why everybody  Do you mean Norton?  Well yeah  Then he'd be like  Just by looking at the guy  He'd be like  Oh yeah that guy's cool  And it's like  Oh there you go  But you don't know  Anything about this guy  And maybe this guy  Just doesn't like  What fashion is going on  This season  And wants to go  Shop somewhere else  And look differently  I guess  You know what  I think it was also  Because  You were arguing  With a room full of guys  Who  The idea of  I don't like what's going on  In fashion this season 
[03:53:00]  Is completely foreign to them  Which it is to a lot of guys  And most of our listeners  And I mean  I wear a lot of wrestling shirts  So obviously  I don't fully concentrate  On what's going on  But I try to  Those guys are  They're radio geniuses  Comedic radio geniuses  They're not the most  Fashion forward guys  You don't think so  Well I mean  They show up to work  In like sweatpants  And like  Stretch out t-shirts  So are you telling me  That 5.11 tactical gear  Is not in season  No  It's not  No  You know I mean 
[03:53:30]  But it's like  Cool dude  You know I mean  Whatever  Yeah  Who do you think  Is the most fashionable guy  On the show  Out of the three hosts  Yeah  That's tough  Because they're all  Well they all can clean up well  You know when they do television  They look put together  They're all attractive men  Yes  But in terms of dressing  Not strong dressers  That's a hard one man  Yeah  I mean you know  Whatever  It doesn't matter  I mean I can see in your eyes  That you're already 
[03:54:00]  Flash forwarding to this clip  Being played tomorrow  Yeah  So you're already  You're already  There but  I mean  It's not  I guess they don't take pride  In their clothes  They don't give a shit  But I mean  And that's totally fine  That's totally fine  But if you're gonna comment  On other people's  Fashion  When it's like  It's like somebody  Criticizing  Radio  And not having  Anything to do with radio  It's like if  Joan and Melissa Rivers  Did the radio police  And it's like  Look  You guys have never been  On the radio  Why don't you stick to fashion 
[03:54:30]  Yeah like really  What do you guys  What do you know about that  I gotcha  I think  But I feel like  Well maybe  No no no  Maybe you're right  Because I was about to say  I feel like Norton  Was kind of  Attacking the hipster vibe  But he was specifically  Pointing out articles  Of clothing  Well  There is a douchey vibe  To hipsters  Yeah but  Norton was specifically  Talking about clothing  I think right  I don't know  I was trying to get that  And then  They're calling me hipsters  And I'm like  Well you're calling me a hipster  He's like no I wasn't  And I was like  I was just confused  About the whole argument  But  Well I think  I think what happened was 
[03:55:00]  We were all calling you  A hipster as a joke  Right  And then  The argument  Got serious  And so then  It doesn't count anymore  That we were calling you hipsters  I would still call you a hipster  But I mean  I call my brother a hipster  Right  You know what I mean  I just  That's how I see it  You know I mean  There are people  That don't fit into  The standard  What's going on  We call them counterculture  Yeah  And they're artsy people  That want to go somewhere  And pick out a shirt  From 30 years ago  And wear it with a pair of  Pants that were from 
[03:55:30]  10 years ago  And put together  An outfit that isn't  But tell me this  It's one thing  For the people  Who want to  Do it that way  Right  Like who are saying  I just want to  This is the style  That I want to wear  There are a lot of people  Though  Who go to Salvation Army  And who dress in old clothes  And who wear beat up things  And say  Well no  I just don't care  I don't think about what I wear  When it's obvious that they do  Like there is 
[03:56:00]  I'm not saying that's a hipster thing  But there are a lot of hipsters  Who pretend they don't care  About what they wear  When it's obvious  That their outfit is well choreographed  Right  And there's a lot of people  That go  Oh this looks cool  I'm going to try to fit into this group now  And start looking like a metal dude  Yeah  Or I'm going to look  You know what  I'm going to start  I'm going to buy some skate sneakers  And start looking like a skater  And they have never picked up  A skateboard in their life  Right  You know what I mean  So  Like Lil Wayne  Yeah exactly  You know so it's like  You know  It goes in every single direction 
[03:56:30]  So  Travis I don't understand  What's going on with the breaks  Why don't you just tell me  I don't get this at all  Well the sex man  Messed up on the breaks  And we have no more left  So like the next break  Oh you don't have breaks at all  No so the next break  That I would take  Would be Ron and Fez's first break  Oh because  Because you doubled  Yeah because  Oh so you're saying  If I  If you want to play the bit  That you  May have wanted to play  To begin with  So are we going to have to play a bit  And then Ron and Fez will start  Or bit commercial Ron and Fez  No no no  We're going to do like bit  Like F.U. line Ron and Fez  Okay so there are no more commercials 
[03:57:00]  Until Ron and Fez starts  Okay  And the bit is  So you've got time  Because I've got to make  Right  Okay got it  Okay  I just didn't know what was going on  Paul was writing me a note  Trying to  And it was complicated  He said a bunch of information  At me at the same time  Well I had a lot of information  To take  But I'm glad that we got  To the bottom of it  So  But do you feel like  You have a hipster style  I mean like I said  I'm wearing a sheer terror shirt  So I mean  Hipsters wouldn't do that  But if it's like  Do I go to second hand stores  And look for cool shit  Yeah absolutely 
[03:57:30]  When you go to second hand stores  Do you do it  Because  You want that look  Or because  Of a different reason  Political or otherwise  Well there's  There's a couple different reasons  One  You can go to certain  Salvation Army  And find an amazing shirt  For 50 cents  That's pretty cool  And I like certain looks  I like like a  Like a classic  50's  Kind of look  How that  Those shirts that they wore  At that time  And a lot of times  You don't  You can't find  That kind of clothing  How 
[03:58:00]  What style  Would you put  Opie Anthony and Jim under  You're really kind of  Backing me into a  I'm not going to answer that  Because it's just going to  It's going to somehow  Come out wrong  So  How do you mean  Well I mean  They're  They are  The way they are  The way they were  You know what I mean  So as they get older  They  Stayed  Stick to what they know  Yeah  So and that's  That's totally fine  You know  I got you  It's just what it is  It is what it is  And you  You're kind of  Not fighting necessarily  Just for the hipsters  But you're fighting 
[03:58:30]  For the freedom  To not be criticized  For the way you dress  You can criticize me  All you want  I don't care about that  But I mean  If you're going to make a point  About hipsters  And Jim was going off  About how they  Look nerdy  And they don't care  About their look  But  And I was just like  You know  Or they  He was saying  That they pretend  To be poor  When they're not  And it's like  There's so many people  That do the same thing  Why don't you criticize them  You know what I mean  There are punk rock dudes  From the suburbs  That come from a lot of money  That will come into the summer  Into the city for the summer 
[03:59:00]  And be a squatter  And beg for money  To look like a poor punk rock kid  And meanwhile  Their parents back home  Have a fucking million dollars  Same thing in hip hop  Did you see the end of 8 Mile  Turned out he went to a private school  Exactly  That's right  So it happens everywhere  So if you're going to  Criticize them  You might as well  Criticize down the row  I mean I would  Criticize Paul  For wearing that  God damn goofy ass  Bandana every day  Every day  Doesn't switch it up  Yeah nothing  No  No  But at the same point  He's not  You know  Calling people out of there  On fashion  And being like  That's fucking dumb 
[03:59:30]  Because of this  It's like  At that point  You'd be like  Oh really dude  I mean  Yeah let's  Yeah  Let's pull you apart here  Hold on  If you're going to  Call out fashion  Why don't we  Call out fashion here  It's the fact that  For some people  It is a uniform  Having the bad beard  And the glasses  And all that other thing  Well it's also a look  And then yeah  Well  It's a look dude  I mean it's like  It's like a hip hop  I mean  All hip hop kids  Look exactly the same  It's pants low  Baseball hat  Exactly the same way  Keep the stickers on it  Brand new this  It's the same thing  I think  But what I'm saying  Is like  There are people 
[04:00:00]  Who just dress like that  Because that's  What's available to them  You know what I mean  I think  Yeah I think  Troy's got a valid point  In saying that  People dress  In that uniform way  Across cultures  So hipsters do it  But then so do  Metalheads  So do hip hop kids  So do punk kids  But metal has become  So a part of our  Everyday culture everywhere  And hipster is sort of  A new thing  A new term  So everybody wants to  Point the finger at that  But it happens  Across the board  I mean if  You're going to  Criticize anybody  I mean hip hop kids  Look exactly the same  They wear the exact same shit 
[04:00:30]  There's no variation  So  Criticize them  As long as it's matching  We have to go  But before we go  Leading into Ron and Fez  I wanted you to hear  One of the times  We made fun of  Tyra Banks' show  Because I don't know  Troy if you heard  But Tyra says  She never heard  That ONA were making fun of her  As much as they were  I asked her about it  After her appearance  So this is  One  Of the  Dozens if not hundreds of times  That we destroyed  And slaughtered  Tyra Banks' show  Here on the  Opie and Anthony show  After that
