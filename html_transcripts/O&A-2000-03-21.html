<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a "Worst Of" segment, highlighting a comedic bit featuring a sexually suggestive and offensive "Dr. Zachary Smith" character (referencing *Lost in Space*) making jokes about pedophilia and child abuse. This was followed by a call from a man detailing a graphic and humorous account of a genital injury sustained from a malfunctioning toilet seat, threatening a $2 million lawsuit.  The hosts then transitioned into humorous speculation about Anthony's alleged smoking and other rumors.  A substantial portion of the show was devoted to mocking songs from Barry Williams' ("Greg Brady") new CD, featuring his "Johnny Bravo" persona, with the hosts and callers reacting with disbelief and amusement to the music's poor quality.

The show then featured an in-studio interview with Crystal Storm, a dancer with exceptionally large breasts (122 inches around). The interview involved sexually suggestive humor, discussions of her breast augmentation surgery, the challenges of daily life with her large breasts, and her career. A caller's request for a "breast trick" led to a bizarre interaction between Crystal Storm and a studio employee called "Spaz." This segment contained further sexually suggestive humor and descriptions.  The show briefly returned to discussing the Grammy Awards and various celebrities.

A subsequent segment included another appearance by Crystal Storm, who discussed her breast augmentation and experiences with men, leading to sexually explicit conversations with the hosts and callers. A caller won a "100 grand" candy bar, resulting in a humorous misunderstanding. A black female listener, Cheryl, then called in to criticize the hosts' offensive humor, particularly regarding race and gender.  A lengthy and racially charged discussion followed, with Cheryl and the hosts exchanging offensive jokes and stereotypes.  Other callers joined, fueling the offensive and sexually explicit dialogue. The show concluded this segment with a distraught caller, Bobby, whose girlfriend left him for his friend.  The hosts and other callers offered insensitive, humorous advice.  A further “worst of” segment played while the hosts were on vacation.

Another portion of the broadcast included a song played by Opie, Anthony, and Bobby to cheer him up after his breakup, interspersed with sexually suggestive and crude comments about his relationship.  The show then moved to a discussion of a news story about Bill Clinton's amazement at a computer screensaver, triggering crude jokes about Monica Lewinsky and Clinton's sexual history.  The hosts recounted their experience at a Knicks game, detailing celebrity sightings (Woody Allen, Soon-Yi Previn, Tom Brokaw, Star Jones) and offering highly critical and offensive descriptions of Star Jones's appearance and behavior. Opie's Tom Brokaw impersonation was a recurring comedic bit.  A phone call with Bill followed, detailing humorous (and desperate) methods he used to retrieve his belongings from his ex-girlfriend's apartment. A phone call with "Lamb Chop" ensued, filled with extremely offensive language directed at Sherry Lewis.  The segment concluded with a phone interview with Buddy Hackett, who shared jokes and anecdotes. A game involving listeners rubbing microphones on their genitals and the hosts guessing hair patterns was also mentioned.

A later segment featured a game where callers described what was in their pants, with the hosts and Buddy guessing.  The descriptions were sexually suggestive, with callers participating from various locations (one while driving).  The show then discussed Hillary Clinton's Senate candidacy, with a humorous, fictional "Cops" episode imagining a domestic dispute involving Bill Clinton, filled with crude language and stereotypical depictions.  The show concluded with a parody of a CBS FM radio show, mimicking its style and using the limited talk time between songs to deliver a barrage of sexually explicit and offensive jokes, including references to child abuse and bestiality. A caller expressed disapproval of the humor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:

If you didn't catch yesterday's show, we are doing a Worst Of all week this week. 
[00:00:30]  It's the Worst Of Opie and Anthony.  Great new music from the Smashing Pumpkins called Everlasting Gaze and some Faith No More before that.  What's up, man? It's Rick.

And keep in mind, if we don't get to it today, there's a very good chance we'll probably get it in sometime later in the week.  So keep listening, all right?  Cool.  Enough said.  Let's get right to it, shall we, with a little Dr. Smith.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  What?  This is weak.  He's just slow.  I do believe that's okay.  1027-WNEW. 
[00:01:30]  You suck.  And we're here.  Head me, William.  Oh, dear.  Hello.  Dr. Smith in the studio today.  Spare me the poisonous bobs, Opie.  I would.  Oh, when I get home.  Sweet home.  William, I'm a pedophile lost in space.  I was going to say that.  You are a pedophile lost in space.  Yes.  What have you done to William?  Oh, dear.  Take him into his little room and tuck him in for bed. 
[00:02:00]  No chicks for me.  Maybe little Penny.  Yeah.  Little Penny.  Yeah, why didn't you go after Penny?  She was a piece of ass.  That's what everyone would have expected.  Right.  That's what the Robertson family expected.  They never thought I'd go after young William.  No.  And then Major West.  Yeah.  Major West screwing Judy.  Fine piece of gash, but she's a girl.  I like young boys like William. 
[00:02:30]  Wow, this is an exclusive.  Are you finally admitting this on our show today?  Yes.  Yeah.  Dr. Zachary Smith, pedophile.  Lost in space.  My schween is like the robot's arm.  Warning, warning.  Oh, dear.  Help me.  I have a robot in my pants.  He can't figure that out.  Help me.  Wow.  I want to go home.  Sweet, sweet home.  Where I can coach a boys soccer team or something. 
[00:03:00]  I'm getting tired of young William.  The same little supple ass every night.  Help me.  Oh, dear.  I'm always fouling things up at the hydroponic garden.  I was going to say, if you really wanted to go home, why are you always getting everyone in trouble?  I can't help it.  I'm a buffoon.  A pedophile buffoon.  Young William.  Oh, dear.  Looks like a plucked chicken, doesn't he? 
[00:03:30]  Come on.  Take him off in that stupid little vehicle we're driving.  Have a threesome with that pointy ear of monkey.  Oh, dear.  Help me.  Help me.  I want to go home.  Help me.  Dr. Smith, everyone.  To start off, the Opie and Anthony.  Oh, boy.  Gotta love having a TV in the office.  Yeah.  Helps the show tremendously.  Did you see him?  I did see him, yeah. 
[00:04:00]  Dr. Smith, he had some fat opera star after him or something.  In a Viking outfit, right?  In a Viking outfit.  The best part was another stupid prop, though.  Yes.  I had this wacky hatchet.  It was a wooden hatchet.  You could tell it was wooden, and then they painted it like gold to make it look like some type of metal.  Oh, dear.  Not that much of a budget on that show.  Help me.  William.  What was he doing with that hatchet?  Nothing.  I'm a big pussy.  Yeah, because...  I'm such a pussy. 
[00:04:30]  I'm always hiding behind young William.  Right behind him.  Yes.  Very close.  Yeah.  Very closely.  Why are you so close to the boy, Dr. Smith?  Yes.  Very close to the young boy.  Very close.  Dr. Smith, my senses are reading you're getting a boner.  Shut up, you clattering clunk of colligionous junk.  Of course I have a boner.  Hey, Dr. Smith.  Look at the boy.  Is it true you're exploring black holes in space?  Yes, black holes. 
[00:05:00]  Yes.  Where's Gary Coleman?  Whoa!  He at least looks like a young boy.  Pardon me.  Dr. Zachary Smith would like a blow-up doll in the shape of an eight-year-old boy.  Yes, William.  Whoa!  Something in a hairless model?  Oh, dear.  Dr. Smith, you sick son of a bitch.  Yes, I like them like a plucked chicken. 
[00:05:30]  Whoa!  Dr. Smith, you are a pervert.  Shut up, you bubble-headed booby.  Whoa!  Dr. Smith, remove yourself from that boy.  Shut up.  You cannot deny me the simple pleasures of being lost in space.  Whoa!  Help me!  I could at least get a little trim from a plucked chicken.  It's the later episodes that are now that William was getting a little too old for me. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, what was...  Reaching the age of 13 or so.  I was going to say, what was he, 10?  Why can't they just stay eight years old?  Whoa!  What a trusting family.  Letting me take him out on that empty planet to do whatever I please.  I can't say that, Rick.  Shut up, you bubble-headed booby. 
[00:06:30]  At least we didn't have to deal with spics.  Whoa!  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  So pay attention, answer.  1027 WNEW.  All right, we're going to talk to the guy that was injured at a fast food restaurant.  Very similar story, like the one that appears in the papers today.  Hello.  Hello.  Hey, what's up?  Hello.  Yeah, what's up, buddy?  Oh, I was very injured. 
[00:07:00]  Where were you injured?  At a fancy coffee shop.  Okay.  Oh, I was drinking coffee.  You know how when you mix, you have to pinch a loaf.  Sure.  When you drink too much.  Yeah.  I went to the bathroom.  Okay.  And I was very nervous.  Uh-huh.  And I had a loose stool.  Ah.  Very messy.  Yeah.  And I couldn't find the toilet paper.  Okay.  Like the gentleman you read about.  Yeah, in the paper today.  All right.  And I went to reach back and like him, the toilet seat shifted.  Okay.  And snapped down on my penis like a bear trap. 
[00:07:30]  Now it's all flattened like a fruit roll-up.  I was screaming in pain.  Uh-huh.  And one of the workers came and started laughing at me.  And why was that?  And my ass was still soiled.  And I'm suing.  It was...  I was degraded.  You were very degraded, huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  And now I can't have coital relationships with my wife no more.  Well, were you having sex before the mishap? 
[00:08:00]  Well, no.  Oh, I see.  But now it's very embarrassing.  I see.  Because we tried.  Yeah.  And she was laughing at me because when I got excited, it looked like one of those party favors.  It unrolled.  You ever see the kids' parties?  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  My slug was bashed apart.  And I lost my glasses.  What is...  And my shoes.  You lost your glasses and shoes when you were in there.  And I spilled a hot coffee latte on my testicles. 
[00:08:30]  Oh.  I got off the boat screaming, help me.  Yeah.  And I slipped in my own feces and fell on a toilet plunger.  And it impaled me in my back sore.  Oh.  We didn't need to hear that.  All the while, they were laughing at me.  Uh-huh.  They just said they'd get me a new coffee latte.  Right.  But I couldn't drink in the establishment with a plunger lodged in my rear end.  No, I don't think that would work.  My penis was damaged, damaged. 
[00:09:00]  I know.  That's what you said.  I hear you're suing for like $2 million.  $2 million.  Yeah.  I can only make love to a coin slot now.  Slat and damaged.  Horrible.  I went to the hospital.  They laughed at me.  Yeah.  They wanted to hook it up to some kind of air pump at the gas station.  Pump some new life, I think.  Try to easy inflate.  Sure.  Like a basketball pump.  Right.  And I said, oops, you're hurting me.  And they all laughed at my broiled testicles. 
[00:09:30]  I must say, you're a mess.  I'm suing.  Okay.  For $2 million over injured pee-pee.  Oh.  Hey, can I speak to Anthony?  Um.  Pull that one off, smart ass.  Oh, look.  Well, Anthony's smoking a cigarette, sir.  Stop it.  His mother doesn't want to hear that.  She'll be very angry.  Oh, why?  If she learns he's even smoking.  Are you related to Anthony?  No, but I know his mother. 
[00:10:00]  She'll be pissed.  She'll be pissed?  If she knows that you're smoking a fast day?  Shut up.  He's not smoking anymore.  He was smoking for a couple of weeks during a trying period in his life.  I see.  Shut the ass up.  I also have heard that Anthony may be freebasing at this point.  Don't even start those rumors.  All right.  I'll give in to the cigarette smoke.  Okay.  This is getting too real. 
[00:10:30]  Shut up.  Okay.  So there's no truth to the freebasing rumors?  None.  Okay.  I don't know where that came from.  All right.  Don't call me your stupid brother.  All right.  Your mom wanted to know.  That's all.  I figured we'd bring it up on the air today.  Whose mom?  Mine?  Anthony's mom.  Oh, Anthony.  Yeah.  Put him on the phone.  Well, he's still busy smoking that cigarette, remember?  He's not smoking.  Shut up.  Oh, he's going to sue you.  Anthony will, my pal?  He doesn't smoke. 
[00:11:00]  Okay.  It was for a couple of weeks.  Okay.  But he quit again.  Well, whose cigarettes are these in the studio then?  Shut up.  There are no cigarettes in there.  If his mother hears, she's very angry.  Okay.  Oh, he's screwed.  You really should.  You know, if Anthony's going to be smoking again, he really should buy the ones with filters.  They are.  Okay.  They were.  They were filtered cigarettes.  I'm going to kick your ass. 
[00:11:30]  All right.  Well, thank you for calling in with this exclusive story.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Thank you.  I'm suing.  Okay.  Bye.  All right.  It's not as funny as a stinking school bus.  I have a strong stomach.  You guys made me blow trucks.  I'm great.  The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life.  Oh, and I, my two new favorite whores.  You guys are really horrible.  Opie and Anthony.  What a couple of ass wipes. 
[00:12:00]  One, oh, two, seven.  W-N-E-W.  And now...  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  One, oh, two, seven, W-N-E-W.  It's Opie and Anthony.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 is our phone number.  Kick it!  Kick it!  That's Cold Chamber, by the way.  Yeah.  Very cool band.  Rocks. 
[00:12:30]  That rocks.  You know, I wanted to take a musical break here.  Yeah.  Just not digging the music we have picked out today.  Grab something else.  We just did a really bad job picking out the music today.  I grabbed something else then.  I thought some of this stuff would be cool today.  And it's just, uh, play something off the new, uh, Barry Williams, CD.  You want to do that?  Have you heard any of that?  No.  Oh, it's frightening.  Barry Williams, the return of Johnny Bravo, Anthony. 
[00:13:00]  Imagine what a bitch it is being this guy, Barry Williams.  You're Greg Brady, and that's all you will ever be known as.  No matter what you try to do.  Like, he tried to get a singing career off the ground.  And, uh, that petered out.  And now he's trying again?  Johnny's back.  Johnny, the return of Johnny Bravo.  So now he's even milking a character he played as Greg Brady.  Oof.  Adios, Johnny Bravo. 
[00:13:30]  Remember that episode?  Yes.  He left the family.  Yeah.  They just wanted to sign, uh, Johnny Bravo.  Well, because...  Greg Brady.  Because the suit fit.  Right.  And he told everybody, uh, sorry, he's got to go, uh, go solo.  Mm-hmm.  But then it ended.  They were all, uh, cool and got the band back together, Opie.  And sang It's a Sunshine Day.  You know, we turned down Barry Williams for our radio show.  Maybe we should have him on so we can play the Joe Pesci game.  Or we play tracks from the new CD and then ask him if he expects to sell any of these things.  It's still one of my favorite things we've done. 
[00:14:00]  Johnny's back.  You want to hear, uh, some Barry Williams, Greg Brady as Johnny Bravo, Anthony?  Is that what you're saying?  Hold on to your hat.  All right.  Yeah!  Now listen to this.  Groovy!  Johnny's back.  Ready to ride your town tonight. 
[00:14:30]  Johnny's back.  Ready to dance till the morning light.  Johnny's back.  Johnny's back.  I'm ready to dance.  Johnny's back.  I'm ready to dance.  Johnny's back.  Johnny's back.  Johnny's back.  Get ready to dance.  Johnny's back.  I'm ready to dance. 
[00:15:00]  You want to be.  Johnny's back.  Get ready to dig just who could be  Too many years have come and gone  This is great.  This is a goof, right?  I think he's serious.  Johnny's back.  Right.  All right, listen, I can't hear anyone on that one. 
[00:15:30]  Is there any other tracks on there worth trying out?  Happy Together.  Oh, my God.  Happy Together.  Hey, Greg, it's 1999, almost 2000.  He's on the cover of the CD wearing his Johnny Bravo vest. 
[00:16:00]  With his triple chin.  You know, it's just time to, like, fade into the real world.  Barry.  I can see clearly now that the rain is gone.  Gone.  I can see all obstacles in my way.  Hey, Tom, what's up?  Are you trying to kill me? 
[00:16:30]  Come on.  I'm dying here.  It's Johnny Bravo.  Let's go.  Come on, man.  Oh, my God.  You have me crying over here.  Please stop it.  End the madness.  This rules.  Right.  I think this is going to be album of the year.  Tell you the truth.  All right.  Have a good day over there.  All right, man.  Hey, our listener's loving this.  Bill, what's going on?  Oh, my God.  Turn this off before I slip my wrist, man.  Come on. 
[00:17:00]  We can hear this one smash, man.  Come on.  Rip it out and smash it.  It's going to make you puke.  Oh, God.  All right, Bill.  Please stop.  They're loving it, Anthony.  It's very obvious here.  He covers a Huey Lewis song.  What track is that?  Let's sing.  Hey, Luke.  What's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  This is unbelievable, man.  I'm loving this thing.  You guys get so much props for playing this song.  It's hysterical.  Don't you love it?  Great, great.  I want this album. 
[00:17:30]  I want this album.  The return of Johnny Bravo.  Does the record company really truly believe that they're going to sell copies of this thing?  Man, I have a compilation that's called The World's Worst Records.  Yeah.  And, like, I picked it up just as a goof.  It's like, I want to re-release my own version, man.  This one's going to be the first song on it.  Well, Johnny's back.  And let it roll.  Yeah.  Here's the Huey Lewis remake by Greg Brady as Johnny Bravo. 
[00:18:00]  Off his latest CD, everybody.  Talk it up.  Crank it up.  This is going to be a hit.  It used to be a renegade.  A renegade.  I used to fool around.  Yeah.  With Alice.  I couldn't take a punishment.  I had to settle down.  Now I'm playing a steel break.  And it's out of my head.  You fell out.  Crazy.  Well, I don't even care.  Because I can tell what's going on. 
[00:18:30]  It's hit to be square.  Yeah.  It's hit to be square.  Mike, what's going on?  I almost go off the damn road, man.  Why?  You've got to stop this.  This is top shelf stuff, man.  Yeah.  Where can I get it?  You obviously don't know music like Anthony and I.  I apparently don't.  All right.  Well, I'm pegging this as album of the year.  Without a doubt.  Hey, I'll send you the copy for Christmas.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  All right.  It used to be a renegade.  Yeah. 
[00:19:00]  That must have been the episode where it was called Smoky.  Johnny's back.  And running to rock.  It's hit to be square.  It's hit to be square.  It's hit to be square.  There he is.  I would rather hear Corky say,  hit to be square.  We got any other tracks off of that, man?  Yeah.  It's real.  And what is this one again?  I wasn't listening.  We are the champion.  We are the champion.  Ah.  Oh, this has got to be good.  A little tribute to Freddie Mercury.  Ah, Rich, real fast.  What's going on?  Guys, I will do anything you need to please. 
[00:19:30]  Don't play another song.  Come on.  Come on.  I just watched some guy in a car split his girlfriend's throat  and wrote,  No more Johnny Bravo with her blood on the passenger side window.  That was Greg Brady.  Come on.  We're tracking through the new Johnny Bravo CD.  I think it's very important for Anthony and I to be up on our music show.  Yeah.  You spin another tune.  You'll be able to listen to me drive my car into this bridge.  Oh, really?  Let's try that.  All right.  I'm not kidding.  Here it comes, Rich.  Thank you, guys.  Vocal stylings.

[00:31:00]  Korn played April 1st at the Continental Arena  April 8th at Nassau Coliseum  If you've never seen Korn, you've got to check them out  Unbelievable live show  I've been jamming the Issues CD  Yeah  In my CD Walkman on the train  I've been playing a lot of the Kid Rock  That one  Devil without a cause 
[00:31:30]  I'm going platinum  You like the Kid Rock, yeah?  Yeah  I really like that Kid Rock album  I like it  I don't think he's got much longevity in the biz  Let's say  But I like what  I like the sound of the album  Why would you say that?  I don't know  I don't think  It's the type of product  I don't think you could consistently pump out  Album after album of  You know?  Well, that's the curse of being in today's music  Yeah  You're only good for a couple CDs  And you're done 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, there's no like  Unfortunately  Sheplins or The Who's  Or anything like that  Where every year you're pumping out an album  That sells as good as the last  Well, Korn's showing a little longevity right now  Yeah  A little bit  We'll have to wait and see what they pump out next  You know, the Peppers  The Peppers  Foo Fighters  Foo Fighters  Foo Fighters  Big time  Yeah  I thought that was going to be a one disc  And they're out of here  What?  Nirvana's drummer?  What?  Yeah  And now look  He's more popular than he ever was  Big man on campus, yeah  And Foo Fighters get to that point  Where they're more popular than Nirvana ever was 
[00:32:30]  Yeah  Getting there, I said  I know that's a debate we could argue for the next two hours  But  Calm down  Calm down  Okay, Mr. Push-ups  But  But yeah, the Kid Rock thing  Like I said, love the album  But I don't think  I don't know  Yeah  I don't know  That stuff, it kind of  It could get old real fast  You know what I mean?  Speaking of albums  Yeah  Michael Hutchins' solo album comes out today  Oh, really? 
[00:33:00]  I hate  How's he doing?  I hate listening to dead guys  Doesn't that suck?  It really bothers me  Yeah  I mean, I'm a huge Nirvana fan  I have a tough time listening to Kurt  Yeah  I have a tough time  I still do it  I mean, you can listen to the Hendrix  And, you know, like the old school  As they like to say  Uh-huh  But I don't know  Like Michael Hutchins  I mean, his body's barely  Barely cold  And he's got a new album out today  A solo album  Dude, you know what's worse, though  Than listening to old Nirvana  Is when you tune in to SNL  And Nirvana was on 
[00:33:30]  You watch Saturday Night Live  And see, like, Kurt singing and stuff  That's hard to watch  That's kind of creepy and stuff  It's like, ah, you ass  It's a bummer  You blew it  I wonder what Nirvana would have been  If Kurt would have survived  Man, well  Speculate forever  I'm sure Dave Grohl doesn't care  Your buddy Kid Rock's going to perform  On the Grammys tomorrow  My buddy  He's not my buddy  We like the Kid Rock, right?  Yeah  And, uh, Carlos Santana, Anthony  Carlos Santana 
[00:34:00]  We wanted to get to that story  What, his uncle was a kid toucher  When he was growing up?  I don't know if it was his uncle  Well, what does it say?  I just said that  He just said he was a molester  Of course, the song  That's up for a Grammy  A few Grammys  Yeah  I'm CBS FM  Yeah  I could give you a little echo  If you want to do it  It's too late now 
[00:34:30]  Past the post  But, um  Yeah, so he's coming  I don't know why he picked now  To come out and say that he was molested as a child  But he said he had counseling  And he's free from guilt and shame  And he's up for, uh, ten Grammys  Ten Grammys  And he's coming out with this now  I think  It just seems the timing's a little odd  Now, what's the story?  Why didn't he come out, like, on the stage of Woodstock  And say this? 
[00:35:00]  You know?  What's the story, though?  Someone touched his pee-pee, or what?  Uh, it just says he was molested  As a child  Yeah  For a couple of years when he was a kid  And, uh, it makes him feel uncomfortable  And, uh, but he's over it  It doesn't say who, what, where, when, or anything  Yeah  Someone, uh, had instant feedback  When we talked about it earlier  Uh, it says, is he Cuban?  Because that's just part of their culture  And, uh, no  I don't think so 
[00:35:30]  It took him 35 years to get nominated, Anthony  Yeah  He's gonna sweep the Grammys tomorrow  You watch  Do you think so?  He is the favorite  Everyone says that he's gonna take it all  He's gonna win everything tomorrow  Him, the song  He didn't write that song, though, you know  Uh, did Rob Thomas write it?  He's part writer in that, yes  Yeah  With another guy  And then it's, I love when the Grammys come around  Because you, you realize what phonies some of these people are  Like, uh, what the hell, Ricky Martin  Living La Vida Loca 
[00:36:00]  Uh-huh  He's not on that  He didn't write that song  And you realize when the Grammys are around  Because, okay, best song  Living La Vida Loca  Written by  It's like, what?  That's not Ricky Martin  He didn't write the goddamn thing  Uh, yeah  That's up for Record of the Year  There's a couple of them like that  Album of the Year  It is just pathetic what music has become today  Album of the Year  Backstreet Boys  Dixie Chicks  The Chixie Dicks  Diana Crawl  Don't even know who she is 
[00:36:30]  I have no clue  Santana  And then TLC  Britney Spears is up for one  Isn't she, Britney?  Did you see her little Sunday layout  In the, uh  In the Sunday Daily News, uh  TV section, I think it was  One of those  Like the magazine section that they have  In the Daily News  I miss that  Special bonus poster  Yeah, special boner poster  Maybe  She's got those  Big cans of hers out  Her lips are just like  It looks like  I swear to God  It looks like she'd just been with a guy 
[00:37:00]  She's got lips  Hummer lips  She has  They're all engorged  And just glazed over  With some product  I don't know what the hell's going on  She's got, of course  The belly showing  I love homer lips  God  Is that the biggest turn on  The big full homer lips  And then she's telling  You know, she's 18 now  Opie  I know  Just had her birthday  She's totally legal now  We could get her in Playboy  Officially  Yeah  And, uh  Things that she collects  You want to feel old?  What?  She was born  1982  Oh my God 
[00:37:30]  You feel old  It's only three years  Before my girlfriend  That's nuts  Yeah, she says  She says in that article  She, uh  Collects diamonds  Mm-hmm  Well, there's something  Any 18-year-old can relate to  Right  She's collecting diamonds  Fantastic, Britney  And then she also says  She, uh  She will never pose in Playboy  Someone asked her  Now that she's legal age  Let me tell you something 
[00:38:00]  About Percy Pears and Playboy  If that next album comes out  And it tanks  She'll be naked in Playboy  Absolutely  Guaranteed  She'll be hoping for Playboy  I'm praying that the next album  Tanks so we get her in Playboy  While she's still nice and tight  Yeah  Cause she'll be in Playboy eventually  I hate when they do that  Yeah, they're 18, 19 years old  Don't want to do Playboy  All of a sudden  Their career is gone  They, they're in their 30s  And they decide  Now they're gonna strip  Yeah  Take it back  I hope her album tanks so bad  Playboy passes her right by  And she's gotta go right to Swank  I wanna see her in Swank 
[00:38:30]  I want beef curtains  Let me give you a Swank  I'm gonna give you a Swank pose  Not the Swank pose  Ah  I hate when you do that man  Leg up on the console  Ugh  The Swank pose  The Swank pose  Right to Swank  Right to the  Let's see what Brittany had for lunch pose  Can't wait to see her on the Krabbies tomorrow though  Oh yeah  Alright  Is she performing? 
[00:39:00]  I would think so  That's probably a big attention getter  I would assume so  Sure  Well actually  Ben gave me the list of performers at the Krabbies here  Let's, let's run through them Opie  Oh wait, where's the performers list Ben?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  Britney's gotta perform, right?  She is  She is performing  With her little headset mic on  Alright  So she can massage her cans while she sings  Rubs her belly and stuff.  Yeah.  God, every time I had that remote control and I passed by the Nickelodeon channel, 
[00:39:30]  got to stop.  Yeah.  They show the Britney Spears concert like four times a day.  That was the one with her nips popping out.  No, this is the other.  Oh, it wasn't?  No, she still has the belly shirt and stuff.  I thought it was from the Nickelodeon, that award show,  where she went on and she's performing in front of a bunch of 10-year-olds  and her nips look like pencil erasers.  It's like two thumbs.  That's classic.  Billy Barty's fingers.  Yeah, Britney Spears will be performing tomorrow, man.  Oh, cool. 
[00:40:00]  I'm trying to see.  God, what about the Backstreet Boys or NSYNC?  Of course they're performing.  The only one I want to see tomorrow,  there's only three people I want to see perform tomorrow.  Backstreet Boys.  No, just kidding.  Sting, Santana.  What's Sting going to be doing?  Kid Rock and Britney Spears performing.  Oh, they don't tell you what?  Well, Sting's latest album is doing really, really well,  so yeah, he'll probably perform one from there.  Has Puffy copped any lines off of his new music yet 
[00:40:30]  to change it to millions of dollars for Puffy?  Give him a couple more months and he'll have something going on with that, I'm sure.  Ben from Jersey.  I saw the poster for about two seconds before I put a map of Alaska on it  talking about the Britney Spears in the Sunday paper.  That thing rocks.  Very good.  Keep the instant feedback going.  We finally figured out a system where we could read all the instant feedbacks.  Yeah.  It got a little crazy here since we've gone all talk, you know?  Yeah.  So, speaking of Backstreet Boys and NSYNC, 
[00:41:00]  kudos to Carson Daly this weekend on MTV.  He was running, yeah, believe me, I don't give him kudos very often.  He was doing this lame-ass win-a-date with NSYNC  and he had to deal with these little teeny-boppers  who'd come running out on stage and answer questions  and tell why they want to go on a date with all five NSYNC band members.  For what, a gangbang?  An NSYNC gangbang?  Ow, I thought this was going to be fun.  It hurts, it hurts.  So, Carson, inadvertently... 
[00:41:30]  I thought we were going out for ice cream and a little roller skis.  I thought we were going to play air hockey and get a float.  Why?  Oh!  Yeah, that's all I want to say.  I thought we were going bowling.  Oh, you seem like such nice boys in the magazines.  Ow! Ow! Ow!  I'm bleeding!  Oh, my Lord.  Why? You don't know from where?  Ask me.  But Carson calls them NSYNC. 
[00:42:00]  NSYNC?  NSYNC, right on stage in front of him.  And the whole crowd's like,  boom, boom, a bunch of little teeny-boppers.  And he's like, what?  It was a slip.  I made a mistake.  And then NSYNC starts giving him,  starts razzing him about calling him NSYNC.  He's like, ah, you be quiet.  You want your next song to be on Total Request Live?  Just shut up.  You can tell he just did not want to be there and deal with that.  Like, he's buddies with Kid Rock and stuff.  And then Kid Rock calls up and goes,  ooh, how was NSYNC?  Were they fun to hang with? 
[00:42:30]  Oh, like, totally razzing his ass.  You fag.  Did you get one?  What a day with NSYNC.  NSYNC.  Oh, this is great.  I thought we were going out for ice cream.  Why are you playing cards in my bag?  Ow!  Why are you grabbing at my little knobs?  The doctor never put anything in there.  Oh!  Yeah!  That is so wrong.  I look like a glazed donut.  That's a stupid contest, though.  It really is. 
[00:43:00]  They all come running out on the stage.  I was hypnotized by it.  Like, I turned it on.  I'm like, what the hell is this?  They go, okay, I'm now from Buena Park, California.  It's candy.  And she comes running out.  Just screaming and jumping.  Her pigtails are flying.  I love it, Jake.  And I want to go on a date.  What the?  What do you think is going to happen?  And they all proposed to me.  And we're all living together in a big house.  The five of them just me.  It's great.  They don't have sex with me, but I got their money,  and I got all their pictures, and I'm retarded. 
[00:43:30]  And I go, wah, wah.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, those guys are fags!  1027 WNEW.  Hey, what's up, man?  This is Rick, the producer of the Opie and Anthony show.  The guys are out all week this week.  If you didn't know that by now, we're doing worst of all week.  So if you've got any suggestions whatsoever for today,  if we can't get them today, maybe we'll slip them in tomorrow or Thursday or Friday. 
[00:44:00]  Whatever.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  You can call up with your suggestions for the worst of them.  Or just send it in through the instant feedback.  If you're at your computer, just pop on the WNEW website, click on Opie and Anthony,  you'll find the link where you can send in your suggestions.  All right?  Cool.  And by now, all you guys know that Mountain Dew is the official soft drink of the NCAA trip to the Final Four weekend,  which is coming up the weekend of April 1st. 
[00:44:30]  They're going to be sending a lucky winner and a friend to go check it out.  And we're going to announce that winner on the 27th.  So keep track, because this weekend there's a lot of interesting matchups coming up,  especially with Seton Hall still in, and I believe Syracuse is still in.  So interesting stuff concerning at least Big East teams,  and, you know, Duke, of course, is still in there, and blah, blah, blah, and Gonzaga, or Gonzaga.  How the hell do you pronounce that, anyway?  I don't know.  But like I said, NCAA Mountain Dew, we're going to be announcing the winner on the 27th, 
[00:45:00]  so make sure you check out Mountain Dew at your local retailer for the end of the cap game.  And do the Dew with Mountain Dew and the NCAA.  Getting back to the worst of, we've got requests for some broken jaw, which is coming up a little bit later.  Bill Clinton on cops, lots of requests for it, going to get it on later on, I'll say,  right now in the 5 o'clock hour, if you're listening specifically for that,  and a bunch of other stuff, including some Jay Moore as well.  All right?  Cool.  Let's get back to it with a little visit from Crystal Storm, the lady with the biggest chest in the world. 
[00:45:30]  The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  102.7 WNAW.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's our show.  This is it.  This is what you get.  212-757-1027.  It's WNAW.  I'm very excited, Anthony, that I got that laser eye surgery.  This is my commercial.  Don't worry.  Because I'm going to be very happy to see what it's about to walk through that studio door. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  God, look at all the salespeople.  All the salespeople are kind of camping out outside the studio door.  They want to see this, huh?  Look at everyone coming around.  Well, we've got to welcome Crystal Storm to the show.  Yeah.  She's 122 inches around up top there.  Oh, my God.  Here she comes.  Wow.  Oh, my goodness.  Wow.  Look at the sun.  My God. 
[00:46:30]  Those are huge.  And she's good looking.  Yeah.  Usually they're messes.  I mean, no offense.  Obviously, you're a dancer.  Yeah.  I mean, you wouldn't just, like, all of a sudden have boobs like that if you weren't a dancer.  Well, you never know.  I don't know.  They seem like they might be inconvenient for other jobs, you know?  Yeah, that's true.  How many guys talk to your eyes?  Not too many.  Not too many, huh?  I got this board in the way, so I think I'm going to be the first guy to talk to your eyes.  Oh, cool.  I'll just stare at her.  I won't know what to do then.  Like, normally I would be embarrassed or something if there's just a girl on the street and she's got big or very nice boobs 
[00:47:00]  and I'm looking at them, I try not to.  You know, you look up at the eyes.  But since you went through the time and expense of getting boobs that big and you're a dancer  and you like guys looking at your boobs, I'll just stare at your boobs.  I won't even look at your eyes.  Okay, that's cool.  Okay.  We should share a moment with our new boss because he's, like, peeking outside the studio door.  All right.  Oh, I see him out there.  Rick, let's get in.  Our new boss, Ken Stevens.  Hey, I was just getting coffee.  There he is. 
[00:47:30]  All right, Ken.  Grab that mic real fast.  It's our new boss in the studio, Ken Stevens.  We haven't had him on the radio yet.  It took big boobs to get you in the studio.  Well, I swear it was a coincidence.  You don't believe that at all.  No, I don't, man.  How many times have we seen Ken outside the studio in the last, how long have you been here now?  Two months?  Three months?  I've actually never been here.  Maybe once.  Yeah, I don't even think he's been in here while we've been on the air.  It's a nice studio.  Isn't it?  Yeah, very nice.  He's got a cup of coffee in his hand, covering all his bases, but he's, like, peeking in the studio 
[00:48:00]  door.  I figured we'd let him in.  Yeah, that coffee machine's empty out there.  Everybody's using it as the excuse.  I need coffee.  I'll admit I was looking in the window.  Yeah.  Well, you know, you never, how often do you get to see breasts that big?  You're absolutely right.  And they are how big?  They're 121 triple X.  Triple X.  Yeah.  Triple X.  Oh, my God.  Those are very big.  We've got to get some pictures for the unofficial website.  Yes.  Here you go.  I'll have a better picture.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's get the really good picture. 
[00:48:30]  Let's get the real picture.  Oh, my God.  She's like, holy.  You know, that's unbelievable.  That's like, where do you get them?  The bra is stretched to its limits.  I got my mouth open.  Look at how huge that bra is.  You know what each cup looks like?  Remember the old crash helmets they used to wear at the Indy 500?  Well, the old football helmets back in the old days when the gift played.  Right, the leather helmets.  That's what they look like.  And there's like two bowling balls in there.  And look at the thing, the lacing that holds the cups together. 
[00:49:00]  I've seen that on the Verrazano Bridge.  It like holds the roadway up to the cables.  Yeah, there's a little stress there.  Oh, my God.  That is unbelievable.  And she's got a tiny little waist.  Yeah, she's got a really little waist.  Little waist, blonde hair.  Cute butt.  Like, what is that?  Like a little Spanish outfit you're wearing.  Yeah.  Like a little Zorro outfit or something.  Yeah.  Bubo.  Look at you.  And the sides of the pants are all cut out open.  If you haven't noticed yet, she has legs. 
[00:49:30]  I don't know how many people are looking at those.  You kind of feel bad that it takes away from the rest of you because you're an attractive girl and everything.  And you've got these huge boobs that everyone just focuses on.  It's like, why bother putting makeup on?  Yeah, really.  Really, you can look like Ernest Borgnine.  It's just like, hey, look.  But you do very well, I guess, dancing, huh?  Actually, it's a lot of fun.  I get to travel all over the country.  Yeah.  And New York City is one of my favorite stops.  I come here probably about four or five times a year. 
[00:50:00]  Where are you from?  I'm from Florida.  Oh, Florida's got it made.  From beautiful.  What part of Florida?  Fort Lauderdale.  Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  Let's bring to the main stage right about now.  A woman with huge breasts.  I don't even know what to name, but we need some white snake for that.  Yeah, yeah.  There you go.  Yeah, you like dancing to the 80s hairband music?  There you go.  Yeah, is that what you do?  Yeah?  Hell yeah.  That's what they do in Atlanta and Florida.  I know.  It's all different kinds of music.  You ever get any, like, pole wounds on those things when you're swinging around the pole?  Oh, I wouldn't fit around the pole with these. 
[00:50:30]  Really?  You could probably do, like, a pole thing where you put the pole in between them.  Right.  You ought to try that.  Lose the pole.  And you want to just lose the pole in there.  And you want to do the reals.  You want to do the real intro for her?  Her name's Crystal Storm, 122-inch breasts.  Here we go.  Ready?  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen, let's bring them to the main stage right now for a beautiful  form, Lauderdale, Florida, Crystal Storm.  Sporting a 22-inch breast.  Let's give her a big hat and make her feel welcome tonight.  They all sound like that, don't they? 
[00:51:00]  Yep.  Isn't that stupid?  They all sound like they belong over at K-Rock.  Hi, a 92-minute rock block.  And a 122-inch bull.  Yeah, that's something.  Goddamn.  Do you do any breast tricks?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, what do you know?  Lots of stuff.  Can you do a breast trick for us?  Um, okay.  Which one can you do?  Um, I need a volunteer.  Uh, look at all the hands going up.  Jesus Christ.  Okay, get Spaz.  He's been working his ass off. 
[00:51:30]  Okay, but I got to unleash the girls for this one.  That's fine.  Oh, damn.  What a shame.  If anyone has a question for, uh, Crystal Storm and a breast, 212-757-1037.  Uh, Spaz.  Here's Spaz.  I can't do it.  Okay, shut up.  Shut up, your girlfriend.  Shut up.  We used to get you laid.  Just shut up.  This guy has had sex with more of our listeners.  You're a jerk dog.  Now that he has a girlfriend, he doesn't want to participate?  No, it's going to be Spaz.  Okay, Spaz.  You're not going to have sex with her, Spaz.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, my dear sweet Jesus.  She just unleashed him, Anthony.  All right.  I'm looking.  Holy mother of pearl.  That's got to be difficult to live with.  There's got to be some drawbacks to having two human heads.  I mean, look.  You know what they look like, to tell you the truth?  You ever see the Star Trek episode with the big asshead aliens?  The first one, I believe it was called the Menagerie.  Sure.  With Captain Christopher Pike. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Her boobs look like the alien heads.  Wow.  They're attractive, though.  I mean, I've seen the big, great girls.  I mean, that's a turn-on.  This is the first one that's attractive.  Very big.  Very nice.  All right.  Are we ready for the breast trick?  All right.  Spaz.  I want you to explain what's going on.  Water park.  Spaz now on his knees.  Oh, facing away.  You ready?  Now she's putting the boobs.  Oh, wait, wait.  The boobs are in front of his eyes.  He's like blinded, Opie. 
[00:53:00]  He's got boob eyes.  Wow.  Can you hold anything under those?  Sure.  What do you hold?  Like, what's the biggest thing you've ever held under your boob?  Can you hold a magic eight ball?  That's easy.  She needs something more than that.  Wow.  Yeah, that's nothing.  No, we've got to find something.  Oh, my God.  Hey, what size were you before you had those put in?  I was a 65 triple F.  What?  Yeah.  So they were big anyway.  Yeah, they were pretty big.  You could tell by a nip size, Opie.  Because I don't think those would be on like A cups. 
[00:53:30]  No.  No.  To tell you the truth.  And then what made you decide to go up to that size?  Well, gravity.  Really?  It started maybe sagging a little bit?  Right.  Because you'd had boobs.  When did you develop?  How old were you?  I was about 10.  About 10?  And you started getting boobs?  I was a decap.  Thank God 10-year-old boys aren't that teasing or anything in school.  She probably didn't have much of a problem at 10 with the boys teasing you.  So I just had my extra skin filled up and I had them lifted.  Lifted? 
[00:54:00]  So they're nice and high.  With like a come-along?  That would be how they lift those.  Wow.  Look at that.  I'm sorry.  I can't take my eyes off.  They look natural.  I'm just looking.  In a bizarre way, they look natural.  They're nice and firm up top.  Natural on Jupiter?  Where is that natural, Opie?  What are you, insane?  Actually, most of them are natural.  My supports are at the bottom.  Your supports?  Yeah.  You're talking about them like it's the new building going up in Times Square.  Almost.  All right.  Let's talk to a few guys. 
[00:54:30]  They're freaking out here.  Stan, what's up?  Hey.  I was just calling from Queens saying I could see her left boob right from my apartment, man.  Yeah.  I was going to climb on top of it.  All right, Stan.  Wow.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  I'm stunned.  You ever do movies or anything?  I have four movies.  You have four movies?  Mm-hmm.  What, like Disney?  Yeah.  With the seven dwarfs.  Yeah, really?  No, you've done some porno?  Yeah.  Yeah?  A couple of them.  What kind?  Like, what are the titles?  Breathful Fantasies.  Yeah. 
[00:55:00]  I figured they'd be focusing on your assets there.  Okay.  Unexpected Entry.  Oh.  Very nice.  Well, I bet that involves the back door.  The leather cheerio.  Does it?  The burglar.  The burglar.  Wait, is that when you're in bed and a burglar comes in?  Something like that.  And he's like, oh my God, I broke into the house with the girl with the huge boobs.  This is great.  I won't even take the TV.  Crystal Storm in our studio.  She's got a website, www.crystalstorm.com.  Wow.  Hey, Jim, what's going on? 
[00:55:30]  I'm a fresh man myself.  I like to know how big our nipples are, man.  They must feel like pancakes, those things.  I got to tell you, they're pretty big.  I'm looking at the top of a...  About the size of a coffee cup.  Yeah, more like the big cup at McDonald's when you get the super size.  Who made it up, Brock Coleman?  Good year.  Good year.  Can you do some jumping jacks for us?  Oh, no, no.  That would probably really hurt.  I'd probably give myself a black eye and all of you guys, too. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  All at the same time.  That would probably hurt.  But there's some drawbacks, you know.  It's very hard to sleep, but I kind of solved that problem.  Yeah, what do you sleep?  How do you sleep?  I had a custom mattress made where they cut holes into the mattress.  Get out of here.  Really?  You say you got little pockets for your boobs to go into?  Yep.  Wow.  You never see that on any commercials.  Yeah.  We had to travel with the mattress, though.  That's kind of a pain.  Really?  Yeah.  That's funny.  You just take the saws all out and cut a couple of holes in there? 
[00:56:30]  That's just good to go.  Walter, what's up?  Yeah, how you doing?  I just wanted to know if she floats like a pontoon boat.  Yeah, you ever go swimming or something?  I was at your lifeguard, and the last time I was at the beach, I saw this one girl.  She was floating like a pontoon boat, so I just decided to run out there and try to  rescue her and just float on top of her.  No, actually, when I swim, I sink, and it's really...  Oh, really?  It's really, really scary.  They're like weights?  Yeah, they weigh 20 pounds a piece.  20 pounds a piece. 
[00:57:00]  40 pounds a piece.  And they're not buoyant weight, I guess, huh?  They're not.  They do sink.  How much do you weigh overall?  I'm about 145 pounds.  Yeah, because she's really small, besides her boobs.  Yeah.  So what is that, silicone?  I know.  What's saline?  Saline supports it.  Isn't that salt water?  Shouldn't that float?  Or just be neutral buoyancy?  I don't know.  It should be, I guess.  I don't know.  They need some ballast tanks in there or something.  It doesn't work that way.  AJ wants to comment about your website, which is crystalstorm.com.  AJ.  ONA, what do you say? 
[00:57:30]  All right.  Holy cow.  It's nuts.  It's nuts.  And I want to answer your question.  What's the story with the lion?  Oh, Elvis?  I guess.  Yeah.  I used to do stage shows with Elvis.  I used to take him around and we'd do shows at the club until he was about, I'd say, about  500 pounds.  Oh.  And then he started getting too big for the stages and now he's in Las Vegas doing shows.  Can you lift him up with your breasts, too?  No.  No.  What's Elvis?  A tiger or something?  He's an African lion. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He's kind of a pet for me.  Uh-huh.  Hmm.  Very cool.  He's real cool.  All right, AJ.  All right.  A lot of people have questions here.  How about, like, sex with guys and stuff?  They really enjoy that?  Uh-huh.  Sex with guys and stuff?  You know, they really enjoy those big ones like that?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It probably takes away from ground zero, though, you know.  They probably want to just do things to your boobs.  Sometimes.  Tell me honestly.  Has there been one guy that didn't want to do the TF? 
[00:58:30]  No.  Yeah, see?  Of course.  Like, who wouldn't want?  Oh, I just asked her.  There hasn't been one guy that she slept with that hasn't wanted to give her the TF.  It's obvious.  I mean, you wouldn't go.  It's like going to Disney and not going on Space Mountain.  You know?  You'd have to do the TF.  Benny, you're next on the program.  What's up?  Hey, Chris, I was wondering, can you perform a 69? 
[00:59:00]  Um, yeah.  I got this vision.  You know, you're on your back, and my feet would be five feet in the air.  Like an inclined plane, you know?  Or a board ramp.  That depends on how big your belly is, too.  Yeah.  Because that could be a problem.  I see.  Can I sit between, or what?  Can I get between those two?  You see?  Every guy would just want the TF.  Thank God.  Thank you, Benny.  That sounds like he's in love with Crystal.  Tom, what's up?  I think Andy's in love.  I think he's in love. 
[00:59:30]  I never heard him pause so much.  I think he's trying to hook up.  I think it's the coffee that I've been drinking.  I don't know.  I'm like, I'm all wired.  I can see your heart and it's in love in his eyes.  Really?  There you go.  Well, I've got to tell you, Tom.  She's a cute girl.  A lot of these big-breasted women, they're kind of, you know, no offense, but they're slobby, you know?  But she's very attractive.  Well, let's take a shot at it.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Good.  Yeah, that'll be great.  As they call her as a witness in my divorce. 
[01:00:00]  So, Anthony, who have you been seeing?  Oh, great.  Yeah.  A girl with a hundred and twenty-two inch breast.  That's great.  Thank you, Tom.  No, I'm talking a lot because, Tom, it's radio.  What are we supposed to do?  We just sit here and go, uh, uh, uh, Joyce, what's going on?  Hi.  I have a question for Crystal.  Okay.  I am married to a boob-lugging guy.  Okay.  And he's, you know, I'm a D now, and I'm interested in becoming a double D. 
[01:00:30]  Right.  So, do you find, I mean, was your inspiration, is this, are you naturally larger, and then  you went larger by surgery, or did you have a picture in mind of, this is how large I want  to go, and, um, I'm going to use this as an act, and I'm going to make myself known that  way?  Right.  Well, actually, um, I was pretty large.  I was a triple F cut before I started, and I went into...  Holy magilla.  Okay.  I went to the doctor, and I asked for a reduction, and the doctor said, how old are you? 
[01:01:00]  I was eighteen.  And he said, you are too young to get a reduction, because there's a lot of scars  with a reduction.  Really?  Really.  So, he said, let me, let me just fill you up and lift him up higher, and your back won't  hurt anymore.  You know, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  You go in...  Your back isn't hurt with, with, with, um, with carrying that much weight up front?  Well, it's the way it's distributed, actually.  Oh.  I want to know the doctor that you went to that you won't go in, you're eighteen years  old, you want a reduction, because you're so big, and he goes, no, let me pump  him up bigger. 
[01:01:30]  Right.  And lift him up higher.  I know.  My God, I won't do a reduction.  That would be unethical.  Let me, let me pop some friggin' cassava melons in here.  My God.  I'd like to be a double D. I'm always self-conscious about being small.  I wanted to see what you thought.  Being you were bigger already, and you went bigger, how about somebody smaller going bigger?  I, I, I, can I, can I recommend something?  Yeah.  Uh, go to Toys R Us, get two hoppity hops.  You ever see those things?  And just slam those in there. 
[01:02:00]  Your husband will love you.  I know.  Bounce around the house.  Laurie has a question for you.  Laurie.  I'd like to know if you had a special mattress made.  Uh-huh.  What kind of sheets do you use?  Oh, she gets those in Bed, Boobs, and Beyond.  It's amazing.  Oh, we have a hand today.  We punish ignorance.  Hey, ass, turn down your radio.  1027 WNEW. 
[01:02:30]  Hi.  Hi, who's this?  Hey, it's Craig from Waltham.  Hey, Craig, uh, guess what?  Oh, did I win?  You are the 107th caller.  Get out of the way.  Damn it, I won.  I won.  I won.  I won.

What are you going to do with 100 grand?  Oh, man, the first thing, I have this old, oh, I cannot.  Jesus, I've got to come.  Calm down. 
[01:03:00]  Calm yourself.  I am the winner.  I'm the winner.  Well, what are you going to do with 100 grand?  I got this, oh, man, I got this box for a truck.  I've got to get a no one.  A new truck.  Oh, that, oh.  Wait, wait, dude, how are you going to do that with a candy bar?  What?  How are you going to do that with a candy bar?  We just, we just gave you a 100 grand candy bar.  What do you, what do you mean?  We gave away 100 grand.  It's a candy bar, bro.  Congratulations.  What?  You just won a candy bar.  Hey, what the f*** you been saying?  I've been listening to f***ing radio for like three hours, man. 
[01:03:30]  You said 100 grand.  Yeah, 100 grand.  We gave you a candy bar.  That's a candy bar.  Congratulations, buddy.  Oh, you guys are a bunch of two things.  Hey, hey, hey.  Congratulations, man.  Uh-oh.  Opium Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  All righty, what's happening, man?  This is Rick, producer of the show.  Lots of requests for that one, the 100 grand bit.  So if you were asking for it, there you go. 
[01:04:00]  Once again, the phone number, 212-757-1027.  If you've got any suggestions for today's worst of show, call it in.  Or you can fax it in, 212-957-WNEW.  And, of course, on the Internet, WNEW.com.  Click on where it says Opium Anthony.  You'll find the link for, it's called Instant Message, which will get right into the studio.  So we can take a look at it and try and squeeze it in. 
[01:04:30]  All right?  Great.  Cool.  We still have Broken Jaw coming up.  We've got Jay Moore, Clinton coming up, and a whole bunch more.  And Jamaican Diarrhea, also on the way later in today's show.  In the meantime, let's get back to it, shall we?  And now, the worst of Opium Anthony.  Your lowest common denominator.  The worst of Opium Anthony.  Is there anything sadder?  The worst of Opium Anthony.  Quick, change the channel.  No! 
[01:05:00]  1027-WNEW.  1027-WNEW.  It's the Opium Anthony Show.  Yes.  We have a lady on line 8 that wants to give an FU out to you and I, Ant.  Ouch.  Cheryl.  Yes.  What's going on, Cheryl?  Big FU to O and A.  What seems to be the problem, Cheryl?  I'm a black listener, and I enjoy listening to your show.  But I think you guys go too far when you talk about black sometimes. 
[01:05:30]  Why?  What, spirit checkers?  We go too far when we talk about a lot of things.  That was Regis.  Well, you know, but it's a different flavor when you're talking about what?  That was Regis.  That was Regis.  Yeah, Anthony, it was Regis.  That was a character.  That was a character.  The Mr. Anthony uses cactus.  Is that what it is?  You need more cactus, huh?  I think you guys are so great.  I really enjoy your humor, but sometimes I think you go a little far.  And is it because you're a racist? 
[01:06:00]  Nah.  You don't think you are?  Nah, not at all.  Can I ask you something?  Sure.  Well, we're making fun of Whitey.  Are you sitting there in your car laughing your black ass off?  Your black ass off?  My black ass off?  No, because even then, sometimes I think you go too far, even with the women.  Well, we go too far with a lot of things.  But it's okay.  It's okay sometimes.  But can you try to be a little...  We're trying to make people lighten up and just laugh a little bit.  Lighten up?  What do you mean by that?  Being offensive right there. 
[01:06:30]  Why do you have to lighten up?  Yeah, darken up.  Let's darken up?  Darken up a little bit.  That's a little fun.  You guys are offended by that line, too.  Yeah, why is lightening up getting more fun and everything?  Yeah, that's right.  Why is that?  I'm hungry.  You're darken up to have more fun.  My sister Cheryl, I agree wholeheartedly.  Now, do I sound like that?  No, that's forever now.  He doesn't sound like that either, but...  We love our African princesses out there.  You do?  Oh, yes.  You guys are my favorites. 
[01:07:00]  I hope he wants to bang one of you.  Do you have a big penis or a little penis?  Ah, well, compared to what you guys are used to...  Yeah, the stereotype of what you're used to is probably big.  I wouldn't want to challenge that stereotype.  Let's say that.  Do you eat well?  Yes, I do.  Oh.  Oh, you're saying a little code word right there.  Because we all know the brothers don't appreciate that.  Well, you see, that's why I didn't marry a brother.  Oh, you were married to a white guy?  Of course.  Now, Cheryl, is that stereotype true?  That the brother doesn't like going south? 
[01:07:30]  No, that's not true.  I've heard that.  No, I've gone out with guys who said, just let me do that.  That's all I want to do.  Cheryl.  Yeah.  Can I ask you, why did you marry a white guy?  Because he had a big...  Oh, sorry.  Whoa.  Whoa, whoa, hold on.  I can't even say that.  I can't even say that.  You married a white guy because he had a big one?  And he ate well.  Really?  Yeah.  The best of both worlds.  That's it?  That was the only reason?  Oh, and he was intelligent.  And what about... 
[01:08:00]  Oh, well, why?  Are you saying black guys aren't intelligent, Cheryl?  Of course they're intelligent.  Then why did you marry a white guy based on his intelligence?  That's who I fell in love with.  Who are you kidding?  You married him for the benefits.  Well, I own my own business, so he couldn't give me too many benefits.  You do?  Where is the crack house?  I'm kidding.  See?  See, Cheryl, we can kid like this.  Teasing.  Where is the crack house?  We're teasing.  You see, that's the stereotype that if a black owns his own business, it's probably an illegal 
[01:08:30]  drug place.  But, you know, we're just kidding.  See, Cheryl...  What nationality are you, Anthony?  I'm Sicilian, so I'm part black.  So you're in the mafia?  Yeah.  As a matter of fact, I am.  There you go.  Okay.  And, Opie, what are you?  I'm a mutt.  So you're a mutt?  I'm a little of everything.  Ah.  And you like Puerto Rican girls, right?  I'm going out with one, sure.  Yeah.  Okay.  He likes them, but he wants...  I want some black tail, though.  I don't think you can handle it.  You know, once you go black, you never go back. 
[01:09:00]  That's what I hear.  That's what they say.  That's what they say.  He wants to partake in some of that purpled-winged bat.  Well, you know what?  You might be a little disappointed in me because I'm not that dark.  Oh, really?  No.  No, my fave is the cafe lattes.  Oh.  Okay.  Hell yeah.  What you got?  Yeah, I'm cafe latte.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  No, Opie wants something, like, purple.  Yes, yeah.  Opie wants something shining.  No, my first choice is the cafe latte.  Opie wants, like, stymie with hair. 
[01:09:30]  You know what, Anthony?  You know a lot about what Opie wants, but you don't have a woman, do you?  Hey, yes, I do.  Your hand, Rosie?  Yeah, that's it.  Hey, Rosie Holmes?  That's right.  Okay.  She's trying to get to you, Anthony.  Yeah.  Hey, at least I'm white.  So she...  Oh, wow.  I'm kidding.  You know what's on the way to do?  I would never say anything like that unless I knew it was a joke.  It's so outrageous and so out there. 
[01:10:00]  It's obviously not serious.  Please.  Rick looks at me like I got three heads when I say something like that.  Yes, Cheryl.  Who wants to be that pale color?  That's right.  Who wants to be so uninteresting?  I guess anybody that wants to work, but, you know.  On the other hand, to have a perma tan is a great thing.  I look every day.  That's good.  Congrats.  You don't have to be white to hold down a job.  I would be educated.  Or to pull one.  Cheryl, I'll prove how much we like you because there's a bunch of people that want a piece 
[01:10:30]  of you right now on the phone.  Oh.  And they could get a little ugly.  Uh-oh.  See, when we're saying some of this stuff, you can tell we're joking.  So you're going to let me hang up now, right?  Yeah, to prove that we do like you because these guys will rip you a new you-know-what.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Let them go.  Let them go.  You married a white guy, so it kind of takes your argument away.  Why does it take my argument away?  I still have a black father.  Because you aren't able to find a black father and a black brother.  Where's your father? 
[01:11:00]  He works.  Oh, really?  With my family, you're together.  Oh, okay.  You actually know where your father is.  I know who he is.  All right.  That's amazing.  He's been married 30 years.  Wow.  30 years.  And when's his release date?  And he's been at the same company for 25.  Yeah, it's called Rikers.  Now, come on.  I'm teasing.  Is that the only thing you can think of black people that don't have normal black families?  There are normal black families out there. 
[01:11:30]  I understand what I...  No, you don't.  Because you only have those street guys.  I'm joking about the stereotypes that are out there in our society.  I'm not perpetuating it.  I'm commenting.  I'm joking.  I'm satirizing them.  Yes.  Please, Cheryl.  Don't you understand?  But you married a white guy.  You couldn't find a black guy that would give you everything that you could find in a man?  Yes, I looked and I married the person I loved.  Yeah?  That's what I did. 
[01:12:00]  Is that so wrong?  No, I'm just surprised.  You married the person you loved and look at what happened to you.  Maybe I should have gotten a black chick.  You should have gotten a black chick.  Hey, Cheryl, have you ever heard the trailer for The Soul of Nigger Charlie?  Don't you even dare.  That is one of the best movies.  You guys love saying nigger so much.  Does it give you some type of superiority?  Honestly, I think it's just a word.  That's all I think of it as.  The way you say it, it makes you feel superior.  Oh, my God.  Don't you want to get me in a room and say, come here, nigga? 
[01:12:30]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Join me up.  When you say it like that.  Hold on.  We've got to ask her that other question.  Uh-oh, what's the other question?  There was a guy, and I hope you're not offended, but it's too late.  Too late.  No, I've got to preface it because it's a little ugly.  All right, there was a guy that married a black lady, okay?  Yeah.  And he called in, and he said that he likes to tell her to put a little nigger into it  when they're having sex.  Uh-huh.  I think it was more nigga, you know. 
[01:13:00]  Nigga.  Like, put a little nigga in it, baby.  Right.  Is that how he said it?  Yeah.  In the middle of, like, she's laughing at me.  In the middle of, you know, the act, he would say that, and she would, you know, go wild.  Oh, really?  And we discussed this on the air.  This couple had no problem with it.  Then the phones went nuts.  People were really outraged and pissed off.  Mm-hmm.  Have you ever heard that before?  No, I haven't.  You know?  My husband likes his...  Oh.  I'm sorry.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  I'm sorry about that.  You know something, Cheryl, though? 
[01:13:30]  I've got to ask you this, too, because I really don't know.  Married to a white guy.  Yeah.  I know that when you're in a relationship and the woman really pisses you off, usually  the guy's atom bomb is the C word.  He goes, ah, you...  You're a...  Just like your mother.  Oh, that's the worst one ever that you could ever use.  Uh, I would like to think, uh, that, uh, your husband probably uses the, the N word instead  of the C word.  My husband does not use the...  You know what the problem is?  You guys need a good little sense of fear. 
[01:14:00]  What?  My husband would be afraid to go to sleep at night if he called me that.  Really?  It's called fear.  Look at that.  Just a little bit of fear.  All right.  So, what were you listening to before us?  Before you guys, what was I...  Uh, 101.5, the New Jersey station.  They bored you, so you moved over to here?  Oh, then my, my husband said you had to listen because you guys were talking about Hummer  Tuesday.  Yeah.  Yeah, see?  Hummer Tuesday got us a listener.  And I told him that we were married now, so we didn't do that anymore.  How long ago did you get married? 
[01:14:30]  Ooh, 92.  How was the wedding?  It was beautiful.  That must have been something.  It was, it was black and white.  It was formal.  Was it?  Yeah.  Black tie affair.  Black tie affair.  And, uh, what, what, how were his parents with the whole thing?  At first, his mother didn't want him to marry me, but now since she has a grandchild that  looks just like him.  Oh, really?  Only with a tan.  He's not so bad.  Right?  You know, he doesn't even have a tan.  You'd be surprised.  Yeah, my doctor came in the, um, hospital room and said, Cheryl, your baby needs a little 
[01:15:00]  brown sugar.  That must have been something, though, when he brought you home for the first time, were you  a little nervous to meet his parents?  Oh, no, his dad is fantastic.  Yeah?  His dad understood why he liked me, because I have bodacious tata.  Oh, you do?  Very nice.  That was okay.  Who do you look like?  Anybody famous?  Who do I look like?  You have, uh, I'm, I'm one of those black ladies that has long hair, and we grow it.  We don't have to buy it.  Oh, it ain't no weave.  It ain't, it isn't a weave. 
[01:15:30]  Get that goddamn weave out your head, girl.  We still grow it.  They grow it.  You, do you have, uh, you have some, uh, white in your, uh, bloodline?  Oh, what's the famous, uh, Indian.  There you go.  Oh, you're part Indian.  Indian.  Every, every black guy and girl now wants to say that they're part American Indian.  Uh, to be honest, part white.  My, um, great-grandfather is a white guy.  Your great-grandfather?  Yeah.  Was he like an Indian or not?  No, he was white.  He was, he was the master.  He was the master.  He was the master? 
[01:16:00]  He was the master.  Really?  He was the master.  Yeah, you're not claiming you're one of Thomas Jefferson's descendants like everybody else there.  Thomas Jefferson would have had to bang for like 200 years to get as many, uh, descendants as, uh, blacks are claiming they're Thomas Jefferson's kids now.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  But, uh, no, so the master went into, uh, one of the slaves, uh, quarters and banged, and then that was one of your relatives?  One of your ancestors?  Yeah, but you know what?  You'd be very surprised with this master.  Yeah.  He left my grandfather 2,000 acres of land. 
[01:16:30]  Really?  Against all the things that the white man said, he's still left in that land.  And to this day, my family still has it.  See, whitey ain't that bad.  Well, my great-grandfather was that bad.  Just because the master decided to, uh, get behind one of the women picking cotton and, uh, go to town.  He knew good, he knew good stuff when he got it.  That's what, that's what he was doing.  So what's the land that, what, what, what are they doing with the land now?  We farm it.  Yeah?  Cotton?  Farm it?  No.  Yeah, Lawrence the Black Zone is like, you're damn right we're not growing cotton on this. 
[01:17:00]  I don't care what grows here, it ain't gonna be cotton, anything but.  It ain't right about that, it won't be cotton.  Well, Cheryl, you wanna talk to some of these people or what?  Sure, go ahead.  You sure?  Sure.  You're a lot of fun.  We learn a lot about black people and stuff on this show, because we don't know.  I know, Earl isn't helping the situation.  No, no, no.  Earl's whiter than us.  I think we've, I think we've turned you around.  I think you like us now.  I like you guys.  We just try to be a little more respectful.  We're trying.  Mike, what's going on?  Oh, hey, what's up? 
[01:17:30]  You're on with Cheryl, our new, our new friend here.  Hi, Michael.  How are you?  Hi, how are you?  I'm fine.  No, I have a dilemma.  I have, I have a lot of black friends.  I'm white.  I have no problem going down south.  But I have, like, if I talk to the guys at work, they will not reciprocate on a woman.  I don't do that.  Mm-hmm.  Uh-huh.  No, you don't have to.  What do you mean?  How far do you have to know her?  You don't know her.  You don't just go down.  Know her or what?  Three or four dates.  Say if she gave you a hummer. 
[01:18:00]  Okay, Davis and Andy on the phone.  Three or four dates.  And would you reciprocate, O&A?  Yeah, why not?  Yeah, why not?  See, I told you.  I got a black fellow right in front of me now.  He won't do it.  All right, let's talk.  Put him on the phone.  Yeah, let's go.  Hold on.  Here he is.  Yeah, because that's the whole, that's one of the stereotypes, is that they, black guys  do not like going south.  I have never dated a black guy who didn't like to do that.  Really?  Exactly.  You must be hot, man.  Hey, guys.  Hey, what's your name?  I'm Dave.  Hey, Dave.  Hi, Dave.  How are you? 
[01:18:30]  Hey, hey, how are you doing?  Now, Dave, why don't black guys like going south?  No, that's just a stereotype.  That is not true.  What I was saying to my partner here is that when you meet a woman, you know,  and you go out for a few days, he's saying, oh, she's going to give you a hummer, wouldn't  you do the same?  So I was saying to him, no, you know, you got to know somebody for a while to do that type  of things.  I mean, that's right.  I agree with Dave.  You don't want to just come out the box sucking on somebody's stuff.  Exactly.  That's crazy.  You have to get to know them. 
[01:19:00]  Exactly.  He's here to me, too.  If she gives you a hummer, you're not going to reciprocate her?  No.  Not right then and there.  No.  You got to know her.  But you know what, Dave?  Well, she's going in good faith.  Yeah, Dave, she's giving you some.  Dave, I think that if I gave you a hummer, you'd reciprocate her.  Oh, excuse me.  I don't think you'd have a problem.  All righty, Dave.  Yeah.  She'll take you down to her plantation.  Now, see, we had to go there, right?  Why?  Well, I know you have a plantation down south. 
[01:19:30]  It's a farm.  It's a plantation.  You call it what you want.  You want a plantation.  You're probably looking for darker blacks than you to work it, right?  No, matter of fact, we only allow white people.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I like to work, man.  They work better than the black people.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  Okay, thank you, guys.  All right, hold on.  It took me a second.  White people work better than...  Are you kidding me?  You didn't just say that, did you, Cheryl?  The white people work longer. 
[01:20:00]  We make the blacks the managers, and the white people work throughout the labor.  Wow, a little retribution there.  No, they work harder.  Hey, Tim, you're on the line with Cheryl.  All right, Tom.  Unbelievable.  I know why you married the white guy.  Okay.  Once you go white, you never go tight.  That's true.  It's often so small that it lets me tighten up those Kellogg's muscles to get a big grip on it.  John, what's going on?  Listen, I just want to know, if I was going to do some black type of foreplay, would I have to smack you and say, wake up, bitch? 
[01:20:30]  No, you know what you'd have to do?  You'd have to maybe rub my boobies a little bit.  Oh, man.  Get me excited.  All right, I don't want to fix my car.  Look, I'm driving with no hands.  And then I'd probably lean down and maybe put my tongue in your navel and shake your belly a little bit.  And steal your wallet.  You can handle my vanilla thunder. 
[01:21:00]  Your vanilla thunder.  Jesus.  Cheryl, you're a real good sport.  Guys, I think you should buy her a lifetime supply of cheese doodles.  Just reinforcing the stereotype.  Well, that's a little dry.  You need something to wash it down with.  How about a case of grape soda?  Grape soda?  So where are the hog moths and chitlins in the college?  Don't get those stereotypes out there like that. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, that's just wrong.  Cheryl, I would like to apologize for that last quarter's comments.  You sound like a wonderful African woman that I would no forget with.  I am a woman of color.  I'm not African.  Oh, a woman of color.  Whatever.  You're going to be another color.  Black and blue.  Not all black women.  All black men hit women.  That is a stereotype.  No, just me.  I am Mike Tyson.  I would like to actually maybe give you a couple of rabbit punches in the rectum.  If I may. 
[01:22:00]  Maybe four feet left and right to the breast.  I'd have to shoot you.  Just don't press charges.  I don't care what you do.  I am Mike to take a bullet.  That King Kong was a pussy.  He fell off the boat.  And a couple of planes shot him.  I and Mike would be swinging up there.  I could take everything.  Oh, God.  I'm going to kick your ass.  You'll like it.  Oh, I might like it.  Will he make it hurt good?  You won't even know.  You'll be unconscious, bitch.  The worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:22:30]  That doesn't sound so bad.  Oh, yeah.  Sucks, man.  From wall to wall.  Oh, yeah.  1027 WNEW.  Good news, everyone.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  Just some feedback.  Very important message.  From Yopaloo in Garfield, New Jersey.  Opie, my wife, Laura, is in the car now listening to you guys. 
[01:23:00]  Could you please tell her the ribs will be ready at 6?  Thanks.  The ribs?  Hell, are we a messaging service over here?  Excuse me.  We'll just put the show on hold.  Laura.  Laura.  Ribs will be ready at 6.  Could you stop off and get some milk?  Right.  This guy's on the line.  It says, in high school, a teacher let them make whiskey in chemistry class.  Come on.  Nick.  Yeah. 
[01:23:30]  What's up, man?  In high school.  We went through the same thing that you went through with being bored about chemistry and  all this other crap.  So, what we did was we produced sour mash whiskey as a chemistry experiment in the class.  Wow.  How old were you guys?  What were you?  11th grade.  Really?  What's that?  16, 15.  Did you get to taste it?  No.  He kept it on the lock and key.  For himself.  He brought it out so we could charge the chemical reactions and the changes. 
[01:24:00]  And then, you know, after we were done, it mysteriously disappeared.  Yeah.  Of course it did.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's pretty cool.  Pretty cool experiment.  It kept us interested in chemistry.  Right.  And, you know, we went on to other chemistry experiments, but we didn't get graded for  those.  Not just when we got the A on.  I don't think I got graded for anything in school.  I remember in shop class, I had to do anything to just get a grade.  I mean, my teacher at the time was just like, Anthony, do anything and I will grade you on  it.  I don't care what it is.  You just have to do something.  So I made like a, I think it was a bulletproof birdhouse. 
[01:24:30]  I just took some heavy, like 20 gauge sheet metal and spot welded it together and drilled  a hole in it.  I went, there you go, wow.  Birdhouse.  And he graded it out of me on it.  You didn't make the stupid metal funnel?  No.  No.  Didn't make the funnel.  And then wood shop?  Yeah.  Um, I made a, a pipe so I could smoke hashish out of it, which was good, but I said I  was making a duck sculpture and that was the head.  Oh, very good.  I said it was, yes, this is the head of my duck sculpture I'm making. 
[01:25:00]  So I drilled the hole for the bowl and the other part in the bill.  So it looked like a duck head and I would suck out of the bill.  Do you get it?  And so for some reason I never had to make the body.  That's awesome.  That was a waste in school, man.  Just a waste.  Oh, all right.  I was going to tell the home egg story, but what?  You took home egg?  Fag! 
[01:25:30]  Shut up.  Oh, did you wear a little apron?  Oh, man.  It was a waste.  We're going to make hot cakes today with our own homemade syrup.  We're going to make maple syrup out of sugar and water and you boil it down.  You know, that was where we went when we cut out a shop to see what the chicks are.  We're doing.  Never remember coming across Opie with the little apron.  Did you have your own oven mitt so you didn't burn your little fingies?  You know, it just blows when you put your foot in your mouth on the show. 
[01:26:00]  What did you make?  What did you make?  Oh, man.  Did you take the sewing part, too?  Did you have the sew?  Oh.  We made, like, desserts, man.  Today we're going to make a shirt with a pattern.  You made dessert?  Yeah.  That's cute.  Wait.  Can I explain?  Ah, gee, this star is adorable.  I was in seventh grade.  Oh.  You're going to blame me for something that happened in seventh grade?  Seventh grade, I think I was making a rifle rack in Woodshop, man. 
[01:26:30]  Come on.  Whole mech.  What are you doing?  I don't know.  I thought it was a cool way to, like, get free food during the day.  Free food?  We made stupid stuff.  Cookies and pies and stuff.  I'll tell you a way to get free cigarettes in jail, too.  But you're an ass.  What an idiot.  Whole mech.  All right.  Food homo.  Oh.  Oh, come on.  Oh.  I understand. 
[01:27:00]  Home ec is a very important.  Well, now, the story's not that good.  Now, go ahead.  Tell me your home ec story.  No, because now it's stupid.  Well, we had to make pizza.  Oh, really?  And all the burnouts.  And I wasn't the only guy in there.  There was a bunch of burnouts.  So we're going to eat truth.  See, and Billy.  Tommy.  And all the burnouts, instead of putting the oregano on the pizza, put some weed on it.  And the whole place was, like, woffing.  It's not a good story anymore, because you just abused me for ten minutes. 
[01:27:30]  Why?  I thought you were going to try to use the excuse, no, it was a great place to meet girls.  No, I just, I was in seventh grade.  I didn't know any better.  Home ec.  How can't.  Oh, Anthony, you're perfect.  I never took home ec.  Well.  Just the thought of that was, like, why would I want to take a cooking thing?  No.  Because you got to eat the stuff.  That's all it was about.  You could hang out by the classroom and have the girls make the stuff for you.  And get it from them.  Look, everyone's shaking their head.  Yeah. 
[01:28:00]  Not in there.  You know who?  Opie, did you bake some brownies today?  I'm done.  Yeah, cool.  I'm done for the day.  We just were in a wood shop, shoving brad nails into people's arms.  I'm done for the day.  All right.  Done.  Take care of that egg, too.  Shut up.  Your mic's down.  Yeah.  Make sure you don't break the egg.  Treat this like a child.  Yeah, that's going to be a hard one to live down.  Yeah, this one's going to come back to haunt you for a while. 
[01:28:30]  Home ec.  I was just.  Home ec.  I was just trying to share with everyone.  I just wanted to share about my way.  Like you shared your baked brownies.  No, that's.  Actually, it does.  It reminds me of a similar story that I had.  Come on.  Yeah, using the table saw and shot.  Yeah, that's just like home ec.  Thanks.  Yeah. 
[01:29:00]  Ooh, you might actually burn yourself and get a blister.  That's almost like chopping your hand off on the table saw.  I can't even defend myself.  Yeah, syrup bubbling on the stove.  Ooh, danger.  Danger.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's almost the same as maybe a piece of wood flying apart on the lathe and taking your head off.  Well, Camille Brumner was in the class.  Camille Brumner?  Who was he?  No, she.  Oh.  She was the first girl in junior high to, like, sport buds. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That was a little awkward.  I remember a chick in sixth grade, Cuba Hill Elementary School.  Jerry, I think her name was.  And she was the first one.  She was huge.  Really?  And she had these big cans, woman cans, in sixth grade.  And guys, you know, would you dopey in sixth grade?  Like, look at you, you got boobs.  And then you went on summer vacation, came back in seventh grade, like, hey, Jerry, what's up?  What's up?  You want to go roller skating?  Yeah.  Go to the Konec roller rink. 
[01:30:00]  She had, like, the first buds, though, man.  Yeah?  And we all just stared at her.  Yeah.  Awkward for girls back then.  She was way ahead of her time.  With those.  Really?  Wow.  Did she help you tie on your apron?  Shut up.  What was your pickup line?  Could I bake you something?  Oh, shut up.  You're an ass.  What an idiot.  Oh, Mac.  All right.  Food homo.  Oh.  Come on.  Oh. 
[01:30:30]  Hey, Ann, your mom did say I was hot.  Oh, come on, Mom.  Don't bang open.  You f*** my mom.  I'm f*** yours.  Oh, this is disgusting.  I say lay back and enjoy it.  It's a hell of a toboggan ride.  Opie, you're thanks for being a couple of real motherf***ers.  1027 WNEW.  Hey, it's Matt Devote, and here's what's happening from 1027 WNEW, brought to you by Bell Atlantic.

[01:32:30]  This next one is back from when, I guess, what was it?  This guy named Bobby called in.  And his girlfriend just broke up with him.  And he was just like a total loser on the phone.  And everybody just gave him tons of hell, including O&A.  So, check it out.  Do you like any of this crap?  He's the worst of O&A.  1027-WNEW.  It's Opie and Anthony.  And Bobby, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  All right.  Listen, Mike Griffin of three years woke up with me this week for one of my friends. 
[01:33:00]  Ah, that's tough enough to cry.  I was hoping maybe you guys could help me out.  Try to get me over this.  Because it's really bothering me.  And how old are you?  I'm 23.  Yeah.  You really like this girl, even though she was nailing your friend?  Yeah, I do.  Yeah.  Are you still friends with the guy?  Oh, no.  No?  Oh, no.  Did you punch him in the head?  I wish I did.  Why didn't you?  Because I'm 23.  I got a job.  I don't want to lose that, you know? 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, he's a smart guy.  You can't look up doing that.  Why, does he work with you?  No, no, no, no.  You want to go in the closet with Spaz?  No, thank you.  I don't know.  You know what you're going to have to do?  What?  How long ago was this?  Two weeks, sir.  Are you getting any better?  No.  No, huh?  You cut off all contact with her?  No, I can't.  I can't do that.  So what, you keep calling her?  Yeah, I do.  I can't do it.  I know.  She's going to start thinking you're pathetic.  I know, dude.  You want to get her on the line and see what the problem is? 
[01:34:00]  She's probably out with her friends or out with this guy.  She's probably getting, you know, oh, don't dig it in, Opie.  Come on, man.  Dude, what are you doing, man?  The thought of that is, like, turning this guy's stomach.  It is, man.  What do you think is going on right now with her?  Right now?  What do I think she's doing?  Yeah, what position do you think she's in?  Oh, dude, what are you doing, man?  You're killing the guy.  You're killing the guy.  Come on, bro.  Bobby, it happens to the best of us.  I know, dude.  Opie, you don't want to hear it, though.  It has happened to every guy alive.  But I love this, man.  Oh, come on, Bobby. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, no, this guy.  Come on, man.  We've all been here.  Don't harass the poor guy.  You think she's getting the jackhammer, like the guy's drilling for the oil or something?  Oh, bro, come on, man.  What are you doing?  Oh, no.  What are you doing?  I'm already hurting now.  We're just trying to make you laugh.  I know.  That's terrible.  She was really good at sex, too, huh?  She was great.  Yeah.  How long did you go out with her?  Three years.  How'd she look?  She was beautiful.  She still is beautiful. 
[01:35:00]  How old is she?  She's 20.  20?  20, huh.  How long did it take for her to give it up?  I don't want to say that over the radio.  Were you the first guy she was with or something?  Oh, no.  I'm not going to say that either over the radio.  Was she the first girl you've been with?  Bobby, all I want to know, is she kind of easy?  Was she easy?  Like, I mean, within a week, what?  Man, I'm not going to put it down because I know people that I know are listening to the  show right now.  Well, I'm just...  You know what it is?  No, he's still in that phase where there's hope of...  Like, he still has that hope that they're going to get back together. 
[01:35:30]  He is.  But after that goes away, you will trash this girl like no one has ever been trashed.  I love her too much, man.  Did you?  No, you will.  Do you think your buddy is, you know...  Dude...  No, no, honestly.  I'm just wondering.  I know.  All I know is that they're going out every night and I don't want to know.  Jesus Christ.  That's it.  I had this happen to me, man.  Swear to God.  Pretty much like the same thing, too.  It happened to all of us.  Friend of mine. 
[01:36:00]  I was totally, like, taken with a girl that was in high school and stuff.  And, oh, just went with my friend.  It was devastating.  How could these freaking get people, you know?  How could you do that to your friend, man?  You want to smack them.  All right, Bobby, the listeners are coming through with some advice for you here.  All right.  Let's see what Mike has to say.  All right.  Mike, you're on the line with Bobby.  Hey, what's up, man?  How you doing?  Listen, man, just get over it already, all right?  Stop being a faggot.  Ah, come on, bro.  I love this girl. 
[01:36:30]  Ah, listen, man.  Just get on with it.  There's other fish in the sea, man.  Give me a break.  Yeah, Bobby, you got to go out and, you know, get some.  A little strange might make you feel better.  If you want, man, give me your number.  I'll take care of it, you know?  Ah, you're terrible.  Hey, Bobby, who'd she look like?  The girl from Tomb Raider.  Dude, that's a cartoon.  A cartoon.  Yeah.  Computer image.  She kind of looked like her.  Yeah, she wanted a beard, even.  Did she used to dress up in the Tomb Raider outfits for you? 
[01:37:00]  She wanted to, but we never got around to that.  See?  You should have got around to it.  I bet you with your friend, you know, they're up to level eight.  And they're treating you like those little monkeys.  Alex, what do you have for Bobby?  Yo, this guy is the biggest wuss I've ever heard.  Come on, man.  Man.  You're sitting here practically crying to OPNA.  No, I'm not crying, bro.  You're like my girlfriend broke up with me.  Yo, look, man.  You know how many girls there are in this world? 
[01:37:30]  Go out and find a new broad.  Go out.  Don't sit in your house and cry.  I'm not crying, man.  I go out all the time.  And how would you keep on sweating her, like calling her up every day?  You know, she's just going to think you're more of a loser,  and she's going to not want to hang out with you even more.  The guy just was in love with the girl.  What can he say, you know?  Really, dude?  You can't just shut it off, dude.  The girl was doing your best friend or whatever. 
[01:38:00]  I don't know if she's doing it.  I don't want to think about it.  I know you don't want to think about it, but, dude,  you know something?  Yeah, but let's look at the reality.  You need reality.  With your best friend or whatever.  And, you know, why would you want to go back to that?  You can't trust the girl.  She's obviously a waste.  Find herself a good girl.  Yeah, you know, he makes a good point there.  Man, that's a rough situation for Bobby.  It sucks.  And then the thoughts just go through your head of everything you've done with the girl, 
[01:38:30]  and then you're just picturing your pal doing it.  Mm-hmm.  And it's just, oh, that is awful, man.  You know what's worse than that?  When you see your pal with the girl out on town or something, you run into him.  Well, then you just leave.  Yeah, but you still get that feeling deep inside.  Like, oh, this sucks.  You just got to find another girl, I guess, and kind of see what happens.  Well, we still have Bobby on the line here, Ant. 
[01:39:00]  We're still trying to get your friend on the line to find out if he's banging your ex-girlfriend.  He's probably working anyway, dude.  If I'll tell you the truth, he's not answering his cell phone, which, that's bad news.  He's probably in the middle of the act right now.  Oh, come on, man.  He's the guy alone, man.  What are you doing?  I'm just telling you how it is.  When you have a cell phone, why wouldn't you be answering it?  Maybe he's working, man, all right?  Maybe he's working.  Ant, what do you got over there?  Dave Day from Manhattan has a little advice for you. 
[01:39:30]  He said, this guy, Bobby, needs to get over it.  At least his girlfriend left for another guy.  Mine left because she wanted to be with a woman.  This is true.  After three years, she decided she wasn't happy, and somehow a bearded clam would fix everything.  See, Bobby, it could be worse out there.  I guess it was.  There's always someone in a worse situation than you.  You've got to remember that.  Yeah.  Kathy.  Yes.  You're on the line with Bobby.  Listen, I just want to say one thing.  I was dating this guy for like six months, and I really loved him so much. 
[01:40:00]  I thought he was the one.  And I met his friend, and it was just instant love.  I thought I knew love.  I didn't know love until I met his friend, and we ended up getting married.  That's not helping me, God.  Why?  Come on.  All right, let me try to help Bobby here.  Kathy, so when you started dating the friend, was the sex better, too?  Oh, come on.  Oh.  Ring the bell.  At first, I didn't think so, but it ended up, the love overtook everything. 
[01:40:30]  Oh.  I don't want to hear that, guys.  I don't want to hear that.  Hey, Bobby.  Yeah.  Did she do everything for you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She did.  God, those are hard to find.  Oh, man.  Did she give you the rusty trombone?  I'm not going to get too into it, man, because I don't want to trash her name and have a  lawsuit on me, you know?  All right.  Nah.  All right.  I think we have one more person to give advice to you, Bobby, all right? 
[01:41:00]  All right.  Old Dirty.  Yeah, sir.  Oh, dang.  We've got to help the youngster out here.  All right.  You're on the line with Bobby.  Yo, Bobby.  Yo.  Walk him through this, man.  What's up?  Yo, K-Pasa, man.  What?  This dude, this guy was your homeboy?  He was your boy?  What's up?  I grew up with this kid, man.  What?  I grew up.  I've known him since I was eight years old.  Like that?  Like that.  He was around the corner.  Like that, son?  He was around the corner.  Damn, dude.  Yo, you got to listen to me, my brother.  Bros before hoes. 
[01:41:30]  How's this brother going to do this to you?  Yo, B.  Yo, you got to start lifting some weights, kid.  I do.  Yo, I joined this business.  I'm telling you, B.  You better tell this kid, yo, what time it is, son.  You got to get this kid to respect you, B.  He disrespected you right there.  You know what I'm saying?  He could have stepped up to you and said, yo, I'm going to hit that.  Do you mind?  All right, man.  It's all good.  You know what I'm saying?  You mind.  All right?  You know, I could understand that.  Because I asked my boy if I could hit his girl.  He said it was all right. 
[01:42:00]  But if he would have said, no, I wouldn't have done it.  You know what I'm saying?  I wouldn't have disrespected him like that.  Why are you guys laughing, man?  Your advice is classic, man.  Hey, old Dirty, you think his friend threw a tray up into that piece yet or what?  No, I'm about to throw a tray up in that piece, too, B.  No, I'm kidding.  Throw a tray up in that piece.  So don't you think Bobby needs to just get out there and start dating some broads?  Yeah, B, yo.  There's mad skins out there, homie.  How old are you?  I'm 23.  Yo, bro, you a youngster, kid. 
[01:42:30]  You got your whole life out of you, son.  I'm telling you, B.  Yo, but you better go bust that kid's ass, B.  No, I'm not going to do that, bro.  Why not, man?  I have a good job right now.  Where you work, yo?  Where you working at, son?  I work in the post office.  Post?  One of my freaking males late.  You work in the post office?  Yep.  Yo, so what?  You ain't eating?  You can't sleep?  All that?  You got all the symptoms of heartbrokenness?  Seriously.  Yo, crack a 40, son. 
[01:43:00]  I'm calling you, B.  Dr. O.D. prescribing a 40.  Yes.  O.E.  And call me in the morning.  The doctor of love on the phone.  You still talking to the chick?  I call her all the time, man.  Why are you calling a 40, man?  What does she say?  Because I'm a loser.  What does she say to you when you're calling?  Don't call me no more.  Yeah.  Sometimes I get that.  Yo, you know, yo.  Yo, do.  Get over that, yo.  But yo, crack a 40, son.  All right, old 30.  All right, brothers.  Have a good show.  All right, old 30.  Thank you.  Sound advice from old 30. 
[01:43:30]  All right, Bobby.  Thanks a lot, man.  All right, later.  Old Dirty's saying he's got to get over it.  Mm-hmm.  But in the meantime, he can medicate himself with a 40.  Yes.  To make him feel a little better during the time, the few weeks where you're really going  to be feeling bad.  You know, sometimes that's just the best thing to do.  Well, that's it.  Really, yeah.  That's one of those situations like getting fired from your job where you just have to start  drinking.  I don't care what it is.  You've been drinking, Bobby?  No, no.  No?  See, maybe you should just start drinking. 
[01:44:00]  Just throw back a couple to numb the pain a little bit.  You're smoking doobies?  Well.  Yeah, a couple of bones and stuff.  But then you get all bummed, right?  Yeah.  Sit there feeling bad for yourself on the couch and just feeling bad.  The next time you see your ex-girlfriend, this will be playing.  Oh, no.  Come on.  What are you doing?  No.  What?  Dude.  Come on.  That's not cool. 
[01:44:30]  That's bad.  Come on.  Are songs like just killing you?  Yeah.  What was your song?  What was your little song?  We didn't really have a set song.  No, but like every song is like about her and stuff now.  Oh, that's awful.  God.  That feeling sucks, man.  It does, man.  I feel like complete crap, man.  You're not alone.  It happens to pretty much every single one of us. 
[01:45:00]  Got him.  All right, Bobby, as we go to commercials here, we want to play a song for you.  A little song for you.  Don't hurt me, guys.  Well, we're not hurting you.  All right, guys.  We're just trying to get you over this.  All right.  I trust you.  Yeah?  I don't know if I trust you, but I'll listen.  Here it comes.  Yeah.  Here it comes.  You hear it, Bobby?  Not yet.  No.  No.  Do you hear it? 
[01:45:30]  I do hear it.  Oh, yeah.  You'll find out.  Remember this old classic?  What are you doing?  What?  What?  Just listen.  It'll probably make you feel better.  Put a little perspective on things.  You guys trying to get me to break down or something?  No.  Here we go.  Ooh, what will be you if she's gone? 
[01:46:00]  Aw.  Remember, Bobby?  Come on.  If she's gone.  Aw.  Remember your first date?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Remember the devil to the girl if she's gone?  Oh, I once went wrong.  Yeah.  Oh, there's your friend.  Remember the feeling the first time you guys had sex?  Yeah, I do.  How good it was?  I do.  Best feeling ever, right?  It was. 
[01:46:30]  God, now she's gone.  Now she's gone.  Possibly doing your best friend.  What are you doing for you guys?  Terrible.  I hate that.  I hate that.  I hate that.  I hate that.  I hate that.  I hate that.  I hate that.  Take it high.  Yeah.  Oh, don't leave me.  She's gone.  And it's off.  Turn it off.  It's like George C. Scott in that movie.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Hardcore.  Hey, is your friend a big black guy? 
[01:47:00]  No, he's not a big black guy.  Thank God's that.  Hi, Bobby.  Remember the first time she put her hand down the front of your pants?  Oh, come on.  Remember that?  Remember the first time you felt patch?  Oh, come on.  Just asking.  We're just asking if you remember these things.  Of course I remember these things.  You all right, Bobby?  I'm all right.  Remember the feeling when you just kissed her?  Nothing better in the world, right?  Oh, man.  Yeah, it really was.  Never want to look at another girl.  Never did. 
[01:47:30]  Never did.  She's gone.  Oh, I.  Oh, I.  I've been a lot of space.  She's gone.  Oh, I.  Oh, I.  Oh, man.  Why?  What's wrong, Bobby?  Maybe this is the wrong song to try to cheer him up.  I think it is.  You sure?  Oh, I.  All right, Bobby. 
[01:48:00]  The song's almost over here.  You're not going to break me down, man.  I'm over that crying.  The big part right here.  Yeah, this is always good.  This is the killer.  What?  What are you talking about?  We're just trying to get you over this with a little humor.  The listeners are suggesting songs for you, Bobby. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, no.  Are you going to hurt me now?  No.  Oh, remember this one?  The classic song by the Cars.  Okay.  You might remember this.  Oh, he's dancing down the street.  Get this way through ice.  Does he have blue eyes, Bobby?  Yes, he does.  Oh, damn.  Every new boy that you meet, it doesn't know he'll surprise. 
[01:49:00]  Here she comes again.  When she's dancing beneath the stormy sky.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, she'll make you friends.  Here she comes again.  Hi, this is that friend's girl.  Yeah, that's that friend's girl.  Yeah.  Come on.  Did you like the way she kicks?  I liked everything about her, man.  There it is.  She's my best friend's girl.  Here comes the line that hurts. 
[01:49:30]  But you'll need to be my...  You got it.  Hey, open your hands to me.  What the...  The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  10270 WNW.  Well, what's up, Anthony? 
[01:50:00]  Hey, man.  It's the ONA Show.  Yes, it is.  It's a great day, Anthony.  You want to talk about Clinton real fast?  This is great.  Oh, my God.  All right, I'll read this one.  Clinton finds screensaver amazing.  I love this.  This is the leader of the free world, right, Anthony?  Yeah.  Okay.  President Clinton, who likes to play up his fascination with computers while playing down  his experience, was dazzled on Tuesday by a basic display of software. 
[01:50:30]  A screensaver.  A screensaver.  He was amazed by a screensaver, ladies and gentlemen.  There's a quote in here.  Yeah.  By Clinton saying...  Amazing.  Amazing.  He said...  Clinton said, as watching a series of coffee cups, deer, and a blackboard form and dissolve  on a monitor during a visit to a computing class in a senior citizen center.  Wow.  Amazing.  Look at that.  Look, it's like pipes, and they're just making themselves go, and I don't know where they're 
[01:51:00]  going, and then they disappear.  Amazing.  He's amazed by a screensaver.  By a screensaver.  Yeah.  This just goes to show you that these jerk-offs have the speech writers and everything, and  they're publicity people, and they make their speeches about the Internet.  He's been talking Internet and everything.  Like, he knows what he's talking about.  Computers.  This guy doesn't have a clue.  He's amazed by a screensaver. 
[01:51:30]  A screensaver.  Amazing.  Not by the Sims or some of the great computer games out there.  No.  Nothing.  He's amazed by a screensaver.  Right.  Oh, my God.  The low-key visit with about 30 participants in the class also got Clinton talking about  computer games he used to play with his daughter, Chelsea.  They were Freddy's Rescue Roundup and the Carmen Sandiego series of educational games,  Anthony.  Just no porno.  I know how to punch up the pornography, like cigars and stuff. 
[01:52:00]  I like that.  Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?  I played that one with Chelsea.  And Hillary played where in the world is Bill's penis?  She wasn't really doing very well at that game right up until about a year ago.  Then she won.  I love.  I'm playing some new games.  Womb Raider.  Womb Raider.  I had a gash life.  New one.  First-person load shooter, they call it. 
[01:52:30]  And it also says Clinton does not use his office email that much, Anthony.  Oh, what would he be doing?  Hi, I'm 15.  How old are you?  Clinton in the chat rooms.  That could be pretty funny.  Good.  AOL's chubby chick chat room.  Right.  I like this one.  Do you like cigars?  Yeah.  All right.  How much do you weigh?  Would you like to intern for me, the president? 
[01:53:00]  That is ridiculous.  Clinton finds screen saver.  Amazing.  Amazing.  Like magic.  Look at that.  And I turned the monitor around, and I don't see how they get those pictures in there.  I'm amazed by the whole thing.  Look, there's a picture of fire on the monitor, but I don't feel any warmth.  How they do that?  Amazing.  Yeah, suck it.  Go ahead.  I'm amazed by the screen.  Suck it.  Oh, boy. 
[01:53:30]  You find these things out toward the end of any administration.  Well, the guy at the helm is a stark-raving lunatic.  Yeah, they've run out of things to talk about, Anthony, at this point, so now they've got  to dig deep, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, maybe he wasn't really paying attention to the computer on the monitor when Monica's  ass was up there, you know?  I didn't really look at the screen set when I was looking at big brown eye.  That's amazing.  Amazing. 
[01:54:00]  Look at that big brown eye.  That's all brown.  That's amazing, all right.  My God.  What the hell?  I was wondering what that was, a computer.  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  What does it do?  What does that even do?  Suck it.  I got the brown eye screen saver.  It's amazing.  Opens and closes.  It's great.  Screen saver.  Now, what does it do to save a screen?  We must all unite to save the screens. 
[01:54:30]  Like the whales needed our protection in the rainforest, I do now understand.  It's time to save the screens with these amazing screen savers.  Thank you.  Amazing screen saver.  Holy God.  Oh, you almost cursed there.  Oh, my God.  I'm amazed that he's amazed.  Even Reagan would probably, yes, I know about screensavers.  They don't amaze me.  They amaze Clinton. 
[01:55:00]  Mr. 20th century, 21st century.  Didn't Gore invent the Internet?  Oh, that's what he should know about.  That's what he claims, yes, Anthony.  I want to know something.  Did Clinton and Gore speak at all during eight years together as president and vice president?  Have you ever seen him in the same room?  They don't talk each other.  Shaking hands.  That's great.  No.  These guys didn't say word, one, not booty each other.  Eight years.  I don't even think they knew each other.  And Al Gore invented the Internet.  Al Gore is my vice president. 
[01:55:30]  I'm amazing.  That's amazing.  I didn't even know what is a vice president.  Who are they kidding?  They're keeping Clinton as far away from Gore as possible.  Oh, well, Gore's trying to, you know, become president.  Yeah.  And to have Clinton in there, it's like, ah, whoo-hoo, you know.  Pat, you're next on N.E.W.  How amused is Bill Clinton about DNA?  DNA.  Oh, I can't believe they found me.  I'm amazed.  How'd they find out that was my splooge?  I'm amazed.  Well, there you have it. 
[01:56:00]  DNA.  Yeah, there you have it.  The president amazed at a screensaver.  That's something.  You know something?  I've got to admit, I was pretty amazed when I went from, like, my Commodore 64 to my Atari 800 with my cassette load drive.  Sure.  You used to have games on cassette tapes.  I remember that.  And it was a cassette load.  You used to have to type in C-load.  C-load.  Or cassette load.  So when the computers really, I got my first Mac, and, you know, you see the screensaver on it, and the graphics are so sharp, and it's pretty cool. 
[01:56:30]  It's moving.  It doesn't look like that pixelated crap you used to get on Atari and Commodore.  I've got to say, I was amazed.  I was amazed.  Well, that's something to be amazed about.  It was also 1983.  I know, right?  How can you be amazed at that?  But it's the year 2000.  How can you be amazed at a screensaver?  I'm amazed.  You know what else?  Get this.  You should have a screensaver of Monica giving him a Hummer or something. 
[01:57:00]  I took this TV dinner, right?  I put it in this thing that I like to call the cooking box in the White House.  Pushed a button or two.  It made these amazing beeping noises.  And you know something?  In three minutes, that came out hot.  They called that a microwave oven.  Amazing.  Normally, it would take maybe 20 minutes to thaw and cook that Schwanz's TV dinner.  Three minutes.  I was amazed.  I ate the whole thing in front of my screensaver. 
[01:57:30]  Are you amazed at beepers, too?  What the hell is that?  You don't know what a beeper is?  No.  Explain.  You can have your girlfriend beep you?  Whoa.  You mean a little thing that beeps when she's calling you?  Yeah.  I am amazed.  God damn.  There he is.  The president that was talking about leading us into the 21st century.  Amazed by a screensaver. 
[01:58:00]  God damn.  Not amazed by MP3 files or...  No.  Or voodoo graphics.  Something called a Bic lighter.  And you move your thumb and there's fire.  No more banging rocks.  I am amazed.  Opie.  Boring.  Anthony.  Boring.  Producer Rick.  Boring.  Spat.  Yay.  Yay.  Yay.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027.  WNEW.  And now...  The Worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:58:30]  1027.  WNEW.  I need a nap.  I'm exhausted.  It's Opie and Anthony.  All right, Anthony.  Wow.  I'm exhausted.  You're right.  The oxygen is coming back into the room.  Finally thought...  Thought I had the energy enough to maybe relate last night's events to our audience, but I'm 
[01:59:00]  exhausted now.  Oh, really?  Well, I think we can still do it.  I think we can muster up a little energy.  We went to the Knicks game last night.  Anthony's first professional basketball game, I think.  No.  First Knick game?  Yes.  Okay.  Okay.  I'll go that far.  What was your first basketball game?  I believe I saw Rick Barry and the New York Nets.  At the Comac Arena?  I don't know where that was.  No, it might have been the Coliseum.  It was probably the Coliseum by then.  Yeah.  When Rick Barry was playing for the Nets. 
[01:59:30]  For the ABA with the red, white, and blue ball.  At the end of Rick Barry's career there.  That was a while ago.  Yeah, I remember seeing some net games at the Coliseum.  Definitely.  Yeah.  That was it.  They did play at the Comac...  Whatever that place was.  The roller rink.  Over there, right?  Where they had the flea market after that.  Yeah.  They started there, and then...  I think I saw Skinner there once, man.  Yeah.  With Molly Adjit.  Yeah.  So I went to the Knicks game. 
[02:00:00]  Scott Herman, our old boss.  Opie and Rick.  And, yeah.  Watched the basketball game.  I think you saw a total of five minutes of the game.  I was like star watching.  I was celebrity watching.  You know how that is.  Well, you've got to give your take on the garden, because it was the first time you went.  So I'm sure, you know, being an observant human being, you've got some observations to throw at everyone.  Basketball in general, I think it's no matter where they play, it is a little weird, because, I don't know, the audience, two feet from the foul lines, from the out-of-bounds lines, that's a little strange. 
[02:00:30]  I want to see that in baseball.  Yeah, right.  I want to see them just sit the crowd on the...  And they're on the floor.  It's not like this.  They put folding chairs on the floor.  They're right next to the players and coaches and everybody else, just sitting on the floor.  You're eating your nachos two feet from the action.  Line up the people sitting to watch a baseball game right down the foul lines.  That's what I want to see.  Or right around the goal line in football.  Just sitting there.  Oh, line shot towards first base. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, that took out that old lady sitting there.  Yeah.  On foul lines.  Or football.  You know?  Put them right there.  So I find that a little weird.  But you could see a lot of the celebrities like that.  They're just kind of sitting there.  Courtside.  So Woody and Soon-Yi were there.  Woody just kind of sits there.  Wait, before you get to the celebrity watch, which everyone does at the Garden,  you've got to talk about, like, cell phone guy and drunk guy behind us and arm around the guy guy in front of us. 
[02:01:30]  Well, you can add in some stuff.  Obviously, you were there.  I understand.  And it's your first game, so I'm trying to see, you know, what you took in.  Well, I was concentrating more on, yeah, the basketball game and stuff.  But the other stuff you get at any sporting event.  Yeah, last night we saw a cell phone guy.  He's two rows away from us, standing up with his cell phone, yelling,  I'm over here, waving his hand.  No, over here.  Yeah.  Underneath the sign.  Look, right here.  Yeah, yeah.  He's got his pal on the other end of the place, on his cell phone. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, they're trying to point at the, you know,  Here I am, yeah, dude, yeah, we're into the game, dude.  Trying to pinpoint each other.  Jackass.  Look, I'm a tool.  I'm a jerk off.  Look at me on the phone.  And then who was sitting in front of us?  Arm around the guy guy.  We've discussed this.  We don't like it.  Don't like the arm around the guy guy.  I came back with the burger and a couple of beers.  I go to get into our aisle, and I look it up. 
[02:02:30]  I go, Oh, chicken up.  Arm around the guy guy.  I point at the guy.  It's arm around the guy guy.  And there's no homo activity going on.  It's just some guys feel comfortable enough, I guess, with their own sexuality.  I don't even know what it is.  Where while they're talking to their buddy, or someone they barely even know,  they kind of put their arm around the other guy's seat.  No, no.  Like they're on a date.  This guy had his arm around the guy,  clutching his shoulder, pulling him in as he's talking to them.  You see that one?  Yeah.  Wah, wah.  Arm around the guy guy.  Mm-hmm.  Right in front of us. 
[02:03:00]  But, no, I was just taken with all the celebrities there.  That's what I was taken with.  Woody, Sunye.  Woody just sits there.  Well, we had a problem watching the game, because at one point, I go, Ant, check it out.  Tom Brokaw.  Yeah.  I swear, Tom Brokaw, walking down the stands to his seats, pretty much courtside.  He was, what, about, I don't know, six, seven rows up.  Yeah.  Well, right in front of him.  Right in front of him was Star Jones.  Yeah.  So, before I even saw Tom Brokaw, I saw Star Jones, who had to continuously fan herself 
[02:03:30]  with some kind of paper product, because she was just sweating.  She has got to be the fattest thing I've ever seen in my life.  Huge.  Oh, my God.  She's sitting absolutely courtside.  She is on the court.  Mm-hmm.  And those seats at the garden are small enough.  Can you imagine having, like, Star Jones to your right?  What a pain in the ass that's got to be for that person.  And she was.  The person probably spent 20, 30 grand for those seats, maybe even more.  I don't even know what courtside is. 
[02:04:00]  I could only dream.  Yeah.  And you get sat right next to, you know, Star Jones for all the home games?  That's got to suck.  Who was getting up, like, I guess getting something to eat or sending her cronies to get her something  to eat, but she would stand up, and you would just see this huge ass just projecting itself  onto the court.  Amazing.  Mm-hmm.  Other celebrities looking.  I saw Matt Dillon looking at Star Jones' ass with a face on him, like, look at the size 
[02:04:30]  of that ass.  It doesn't matter who you are.  The whole arena.  Yeah.  You know, you forgot to mention one thing, the halftime.  Oh, yeah.  The halftime activities.  What was the halftime activities all about last night?  Because everyone was laughing at this one lady.  They put an image on the screen.  I was distracted.  What were they trying to do with that?  They were like loving couples for Valentine's Day that had a little strife in their lives  or something like that.  They overcame through the love of each other.  Yeah. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  So they put the woman's picture up on the screen talking about how in love she is with her  husband and everything.  They had the husband first.  Yeah.  And everyone was really into the story, like, oh, wow, she's a special lady.  And, obviously, the lady's there, and they put her picture up on the screen.  And she's talking a video clip of her professing her.  Oh, wow.  She was huge.  Huge.  And the whole freaking garden starts laughing.  And she's there.  She's there on the court waiting.  Oh, my God.  She's there on the court waiting to come out to be reunited with her lover there. 
[02:05:30]  Like Jabba the Hutt.  Yeah.  The hare.  You heard a collective.  Oh.  Yeah.  And the funny thing was all the women who were seated around us hearing us go, oh, my God.  Oh, they're so mean.  Oh, that's terrible.  That's so mean.  It was just so funny, though, because you just weren't expecting it.  And then they're like, well, let's bring them out here on the court.  It's like, oh, my God, she's here.  She saw, like, thousands of people at the garden just razz her. 
[02:06:00]  Let me ask Rick.  Hey, Rick, did you see the halftime festivities?  No, actually, I went out because I was hysterical laughing about Star.  Like if she has one of those own guys, you know, who clean up the sweat off the floor with those bones?  Yeah.  How does she got her own guys?  Who sits by the seat and gets up every five minutes?  I was trying to watch the game.  We go, down in front.  Come on.  Yeah, then the guy comes out with that big, huge, you know, janitor, thin mop thing to wipe up the sweat on your Star Jones.  I was waiting for the guy next to him to wave the smell away from him. 
[02:06:30]  It's terrible.  All right, Rick, thank you.  All right, guys, take it easy.  Yeah, sorry about that.  I thought he had a comment about the halftime festivities.  What are you laughing at?  Oh, she's an intern for Star Jones?  Do you want to talk to Louie?  No, let's see.  Louie!  Yeah, he's an intern for that fat slob.  Really?  Yeah.  Every now and then I have to go out and pick up a big bell for that salad to eat.  Well, she had people going out getting her stuff to eat.  Let me tell you something.  She eats a lot, that big heifer.  Yeah.  And she stinks like a gorilla.  Oh, my God. 
[02:07:00]  She wears a lot of perfume and they're, like, always washed.  When you pass her, forget about it, man.  It's stuck to you.  She's a diva, though.  Come on, Louie.  I'm a diva.  She's a diva.  Divas don't smell.  She's a diva, all right.  I'm watching a basketball game.  Give me some nachos and chicken wings.  And a couple of them burgers.  And some french fries and some pizza.  Give me some a couple of tacos.  The worst part is when they set up the buffet, like, for the talent that comes in, as she  calls it, the talent.  Yeah.  You can't touch none of that stuff.  But yet, she's over there, bent over, hogging everything.  We heard that, too, from somebody else last night. 
[02:07:30]  She's the worst.  Saying that they were setting up a buffet and she was eating the cheese as fast as the  people were laying it out.  And don't touch the bagels.  You touch the bagels, she freaks out.  I need some nachos and tacos.  Give me a diet Coke with that, please.  I'm watching my weight.  I'm watching it grow by leaps and bounds.  I'm a diva.  And she had the good hair on, too, like that.  Yeah, I saw it.  Yeah, she has a wig on.  I would have loved to have just seen somebody pull that wig off. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, my God.  Wouldn't that be great?  Monica.  Hey.  Hi.  You were stuck in a steam room with Star Jones?  I go to a spa here in New York.  Yeah.  And I go in the steam room.  It's really beautiful.  Tiles and everything.  And this woman comes in.  I didn't see who she was at first.  And she takes her towel off and spreads out.  And I realize it's Star Jones.  Oh.  Oh, it was horrible.  I'm in a steam room. 
[02:08:30]  I'm like a big steam dumpling.  Look at me.  Oh, you must have been horrified.  Did she have her hair on?  I didn't see.  She had a towel on her head.  Yeah, because I got to take my hair off.  Too much steam builds up underneath there.  Yeah, pops off like a champagne cork.  I get hot.  Yeah, poor Monica.  You had to go through that, huh?  I had to leave.  Yeah.  All right.  Like a big oven stuffer roaster in the steam room.  With my pop-up gut.  Big fat. 
[02:09:00]  I got to fan myself.  Yeah.  It's only 30 below.  Woo.  Building up some heat, burning off some of this fat.  So we got distracted.  Yeah.  She was there.  Yeah, that was very distracting.  Well, then the Tom Brokaw.  That was great.  Because if you're a fan of this show, I mean, you've heard Anthony do the Tom Brokaw over  and over again.  So Aunt and I and Rick and our old boss, Scott Herman, were sitting there.  And Aunt is looking at Tom Brokaw and doing his voice and making comments about everything  he sees going on around him. 
[02:09:30]  And we couldn't breathe.  We almost forgot who won.  Just even when he was just going into the aisle.  Yeah.  Oh, pardon me, please.  Tom Brokaw coming through.  NBC Nightly News.  Hello.  Pardon me.  Please excuse me.  I have the next seat down.  I'm getting a little woozy trying to get to my seat.  I don't want to feel over on anybody trying to enjoy the basketball game.  Hello.  Hello.  Yes, yes.  I'm sitting next to you.  None other than Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, my God.  Look at the size of Star Jones.  She's as big as the Achille Laurel.  What a fun effort.  Uh-oh.  She's coming this way.  I don't want to have to shake hands with her.  Hello, Star Jones.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  Shake hands.  Yes.  Hey, she's nibbling at my hand.  That's not a chicken wing, you sow.  Get off of me.  All right.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News. 
[02:10:30]  Hey, Tom, who else did you see at the game?  Oh, I wasn't sure about this, but I found out that Dionne Warwick plays center for the Knicks.  No, that's Patrick Ewing.  Oh, it'll look like Dionne Warwick.  Oh, it does.  I was sure.  Did you see me slip off to the bathroom with Bobby Brown and do some cocaine?  No, you didn't.  I was doing blow with Bobby Brown.  Well, Bobby Brown was...  Wang and broad. 
[02:11:00]  Was at the game last night, Mr. Brokaw.  But I don't think you went into the bathroom to do lines with Bobby Brown.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  I also saw Woody and his pink sooying.  Fascinating.  Her and her horizontally slanted gas.  Yeah.  Oh, here come the little Nick dancers.  What do they call them?  Nick City dancers.  The Nick City sluts. 
[02:11:30]  I love them.  Look.  I have to sit here like I'm not watching, but I'm smuggling a bone in my pants.  Did you see that?  How he couldn't stand up?  Like, everybody would kind of stand up and look at the Nick City dancers.  Of course.  You know, you got to check him out.  Yeah.  And he wouldn't stand up.  I'm Tom Brokaw.  I'm NBC Nightly News.  I must remain calm.  I don't look like I'm excited.  I don't want to get a boner.  Paris has thought Star Jones thinks it's a foot-long hot dog. 
[02:12:00]  That would be the last I see of that thing.  Oh, my God.  Nick City.  I'm going to pop a nut.  They think they're all hot, the Nick City dancers.  They're artistic.  They're artistes.  They're not just dancers.  They're Nick City dancers.  Baby, you're one step away from sliding down the pole for a buck down the G-string.  From me, Tom Brokaw.  And I go to Flankstance.  NBC Nightly News. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, here comes that pig, Star Jones.  No Star.  My hamburger.  Away.  Back.  Somebody get me a cattle prod.  I'm going to shock this fat ass.  Back to your seats.  Hey, Tom, you seem a little more outrageous than normal.  Well, I was very dribbling for the game last night, and I still had about an eight ball left from Bobby.  And we were banging broads all night.  Yeah.  It was great. 
[02:13:00]  I'm sure I'll crash later when I have to do everything.  Fascinating game, though.  I love that.  Well, it's real squeal.  What a player.  Boy, it certainly looked like he should be behind a wall with measurements on it.  My God.  He looks like everyone you picture doing a drive-by.  Doesn't he?  Tom, you can't say that.  A man looks like a criminal. 
[02:13:30]  You cannot say that.  I'm Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  I know criminals.  I report them on a nightly basis.  Yeah.  I swear to God, he looks like a criminal.  He should just be in a lineup or something good about basketball.  Oh, Tom.  Oh, Christ.  Sar Jones, back again.  Sar, back to your seats.  You know, when I first saw her, I thought maybe the little halftime show was Shamu the Killer Whale. 
[02:14:00]  I realized it was that fat-ass Sar Jones.  Oh, look.  Here she goes, backing into her seat.  I can't beep.  No, that joke went in no way.  Beep.  I can't beep.  Hey, Sar, sit down.  You're blocking half of the course view. 
[02:14:30]  Well, you had to catch me, Tom Brokaw, at Laugh Your Balls Off in Poughkeepsie, and I'll  be playing Rascals in Ocean County.  Yeah, why don't you open up for Bobby Slayton this week?  Yes, Tom Brokaw.  Yeah.  Opening for Bobby Slayton.  Slayton.  Yeah.  That's right.  Rascals Friday and Saturday.  I think I'm crashing.  I can better call Bobby.  All right.  For another eight ball.  Oh, look.  My breather's going off. 
[02:15:00]  That doesn't work ever.  Hey, Rick, could you get a breather sound on this thing?  Sure, Mr. Brokaw.  Thank you.  Well, Tom, thanks for stopping by.  Tom Brokaw.  Here he goes.  Tom Brokaw, everyone.  Tom Brokaw.  It's the worst of opening, Anthony.  So pay attention, answer.  107. 
[02:15:30]  W.  N.E.W.  All right, guys.  What's happening, man?  It's Rick, producer for the Open Anthony Show.

[02:17:00]  Now, continuing on, we've got this thing where Ant was talking about how, I guess if you don't know already,  he's kind of going through a transitional period in his life, had to get some new clothes,  couldn't get his old clothes, couldn't get his stuff.  Well, just listen to the bit and you'll figure it out, okay?  Today, you're stuck with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  107-WNEW.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:17:30]  Hey, look who stopped by to say hi today, Anthony.  How, Bill?  How, Bill?  How, Bill?  Hey.  Hasn't been on the show in a while?  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, Bill, you haven't seen your buddy Anthony in a while?  Are you digging his new clothes?  Ooh, look at that.  There must be somebody new in your life.  Well, at least there's new clothes.  Because I can't get my old one.  You know, she took everything, man. 
[02:18:00]  The clothes are gone.  God.  I took one little batch of clothing.  That was it?  Your computer and rent?  Yeah, like my computer and a few clothes and stuff.  I thought I'd be able to go back and get the rest of my clothing.  No.  Well, the phone rang today in the office.  Uh-oh.  Rick picks it up.  Do I ever pick up my effing telephone in the office ever, ever, ever?  Never, ever, ever.  Do I ever?  I mean, we're in meetings.  The phone's ringing.  I'm like, I don't care. 
[02:18:30]  I'm not picking up the phone.  I don't pick it up.  Why did I pick up the phone?  What would we expect?  Because you thought it was the Hard Rock calling back to bring us lunch or something.  Right.  But why would they have my phone number?  Because I gave them my extension.  Why did you give them my extension knowing I never answered the phone?  Because you were on Opie's extension doing an interview.  I explained this to you.  Regardless of how it happened, I never answered the phone.  Rick answers the phone.  He goes, oops, I guess I shouldn't have answered that.  Oh, so now I picked the phone up. 
[02:19:00]  It's the future ex.  Oops.  And what's your...  You know, talking about a couple of finances and things like that, you know?  Some issues.  Some issues.  Sure.  So I bring up the point that I'd like to come by maybe and get the rest of my clothes at some point.  Opie.  It's going to be hard to get all my...  The rest of my clothes.  Yeah. 
[02:19:30]  Seems that...  Seems they somehow made their way to goodwill.  Our own Ziggy that we had on this show is probably wearing some of my shirts.  I can get some clothes.  Yeah.  Seems my clothes are bagged up and shipped out.  Great.  To goodwill. 
[02:20:00]  God, we could at least auction them off on the show.  Yeah.  Something.  Made some money for your defense fund.  You can't believe it.  It's like, oh, yeah, come by and get some of my clothes.  Oh, clothes?  That's how we need no movement.  It's underwear.  It's $4.95.  Yeah.  Seems, uh...  Seems the clothing is not an issue anymore.  Don't feel bad, Ed.  I had a friend of mine show up at a club one night wearing his work boots covered with tar, 
[02:20:30]  dress slacks,  and the vest for the dress slacks.  No shirt.  I look at him.  I look at him.  I go, Chip, what happened?  Yo, Billy, man, she took everything.  Just the vest.  Just the vest.  What was it, man?  Crappy, encrusted boots.  She took everything.  Big-ass, hairy chest.  With just the vest on. 
[02:21:00]  Hang on.  And he had to go down to the bar.  He had to go.  Had nowhere else to go.  With the vest on.  Yeah, this worked, man.  Yeah, this looked good.  Yo, Billy, man, how'd I look?  Friggin' Chip, man.  Chip, Chip.  Yo, Billy, man.  Yo, Billy, man.  The best part of this story,  Ed went back to his place.  We've talked about it on the air, so I guess we can bring it up again.  Yeah, I had to get my computer equipment.  But, see, at that point, you had a chance to get your clothes. 
[02:21:30]  It just shows you how much you really like your computer.  Well, I only had a limited time.  Because at that point.  Limited window of opportunity.  Speaking of that window of opportunity,  how did you get in there?  Through the window of opportunity.  Well, yeah.  No, because I was thinking in my head,  based on previous things that had happened, 
[02:22:00]  you know, I won't go into any details,  I was under the assumption that if I went and knocked on the door  and she was home,  that I wouldn't have been able to get in to get my computer equipment.  So I opted to take the other chance,  which is to just let myself in, let's say,  to the house that I was paying rent on anyway.  Can you picture that?  Yeah, that was me.  Hey, isn't that that famous radio guy?  What?  I was hanging down from cables through the roof, 
[02:22:30]  trying not to set off the floor alarm.  I was hovering over it,  and a little bead of sweat fell off my forehead.  It almost hit the floor.  So it landed on my arm, I think.  Here's the computer equipment.  Let me just pop the disc out.  Oh, I've got to get my porn.  God knows what kind of trouble that can make for me in a court of law.  Yeah, I wasn't concerned more with my computer equipment than what was on that hard drive. 
[02:23:00]  Can't try to reformat this thing.  Sink me for sure.  Yes, must reformat hard drive.  Now, so I reclaimed my computer equipment,  and now all that was over there that I figured I would go by at some point and pick up  was my clothes, which is Goodwill.  I still don't know the fate of my radio-controlled helicopter. 
[02:23:30]  Something tells me, yeah, same fate as the old NBC traffic chopper.  Same fate just as well as Stevie Ray's chopper, I do believe.  What else, man?  What about that great mountain bike we got?  No, I got that.  You got that?  I got that when I went to get my computer.  Oh, I strapped that to the roof.  Yeah, that's how I made my getaway, on the mountain bike.  I asked Rick to borrow his mountain biking pants,  and I strapped everything to my back. 
[02:24:00]  Well, look at the bright side.  There's some poor, unfortunate kid with a brand-new helicopter  flying around with an FN Talk at 1027 t-shirt.  Jesus Christ.  We should have a new contest.  Spot Anthony's clothes on the street.  If you find any of my clothing, yeah, let me know.  It would be some, let's see, WAAF Boston shirts. 
[02:24:30]  That might turn up.  Some AEW stuff.  Some beer and liquor t-shirts.  Plenty of Budweiser clothing.  Oh, I got my golf clubs, too, there, Bill.  We could still play some golf.  I love your priorities, it's great.  Computer, mountain biking.  Toys.  Right.  The clothing was just like an afterthought of what I threw on top of the golf clubs.  Well, that's very funny, Anthony.  Tried, yeah.  But funny.  Well, you know, it's life, I'll be in. 
[02:25:00]  You're left with more than I, Anthony.  Corky Anthony.  What were you saying, Bill?  Yeah, Bill.  You're left with more than I did.  Yeah.  You know.  Bill kind of went through a situation.  It happened to be summer.  All I had was shorts and a t-shirt.  And you got, Bill, wiped out.  Can you retell the story?  That's one of the funniest stories ever. 
[02:25:30]  Ever.  Cute little story.  You know, I had a story about how my last couple of weeks ago, my love life hit rock bottom.  A couple of weeks ago?  You want me to tell this story on top of that story?  A couple of weeks ago something happened?  Yeah.  Your love life hit rock bottom.  Look, he's all, look at his face.  What happened?  It's embarrassing.  I didn't hear about this one.  It's pretty embarrassing.  What happened?  It's, well, there's two stories in one, actually.  I'm at the local watering hole, Peppers.  Sure.  And Friday afternoon, happy hour. 
[02:26:00]  I usually hang for a couple hours and I go home.  That was the deal.  I was ready to go home.  In walks the nerdiest looking guy you've ever seen in your life.  I'm talking crew cut, Coke bottle glasses, you know, the pencils in his top pocket.  Sits down, orders eight shots.  Michael, this guy isn't with anybody.  Bangs all eight shots.  Tequila, I think.  So I said, you know, I got to hang out and watch this.  If you wanted to go home.  You know, I mean, talk about out of his element. 
[02:26:30]  Right.  Picture the front row at a Rolling Stones concert.  Right.  1969.  The camera's panning across the front row.  Bikers, hippies, and all of a sudden there's Pee Wee Herman.  That's where this guy.  That's where this guy.  So he looks at me and goes, hey, you want to do a Dr. Pepper?  I'm like, what the hell is that?  You drop a shot in a Guinness or whatever.  That's a Huntington drink.  All the way, yeah.  So, you know, I did one.  I'm like, you know, that's not bad.  Yeah.  I'm like, okay.  And I'm banging him.  I'm like, this is pretty good. 
[02:27:00]  The last thing I remember was saying, I don't think I should drive home.  Right.  That was the last thing I remember.  I woke up Saturday morning.  Now, you know how water beds work?  Yeah.  You know, water displacement, buoyancy.  Sure.  Normally, my alarm clock is right at eye level.  Right.  I wake up.  I'm like, why am I looking down at my alarm clock?  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  That meant somebody was on the other side pushing down on that bed, thus lifting you up a little more than you're used to. 
[02:27:30]  270 pounds worth.  Oh, my God.  Where did you find him?  What the hell?  You don't even remember?  No.  No.  The last thing I remember was saying, I think I should get a ride home.  And you ended up with a chick that was 270 pounds?  At least.  Were you hypnotized?  At least.  I was anesthetized.  Oh, my God.  Now, I got up and I said, you got to go. 
[02:28:00]  You have to go.  Before any of my pals come over.  I'll never live it down.  Oh, it's too late now.  You know, I went back to the bar the next day to get my car.  The whole place was looking at me like, are you nuts?  I'm like, you know.  Bill's nailed some pretty quality tail in his day, too.  You know, like it's his reputation.  He walks out with a heifer.  It's like, whoa.  He's slumming tonight.  I think that heifer carried me out. 
[02:28:30]  Put me in her back pocket and took me home.  Oh, man.  So, anyway, I said, they said, you know the guy that was buying you those Dr. Peppers?  I said, yeah.  They said, the paramedics had to show up.  Take him out on a stretcher.  That's a good night.  You were the lucky one again.  Yeah, all time low.  All time low.  That's a good story, too.  You've been better off on the stretcher.  Yeah, I know.  I would have been.  Too funny.  Bill, are you going to tell the other story or what? 
[02:29:00]  You've told it before, but it's just, it's a killer.  Bill had a gag.  Well, you know, I'm working my butt off.  You know, I'm sending my wife to school to become an RN, paying for the house, and she  finally gets a job as an RN.  I can't look.  Starts banging the doctor.  Oh, man.  So he's still on his swallow.  Yeah.  Turns out to be my best friend's second cousin. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  So, you know, I said to him, I'm like, hey, you know, what's the deal with this guy?  He's like, oh, he bangs all the nurses.  Oh, just give it up.  Yeah.  Great.  Great.  So I basically, you know, got booted out of the house, took everything, left me with nothing.  And, you know, my mother's saying, well, don't worry, honey.  What goes around comes around.  I'm like, yeah, ma, right.  You know?  You know, there's no way this is ever going to even out.  A couple of years later, I hear from my best friend that the guy gets in an accident with 
[02:30:00]  his jaguar, bites off his tongue.  And they can't find it.  I figured I'd give him a jingle.  You called him up.  I called him up.  Remember me?  And there's a business.  Can I cut your tongue?  Dick.  Wow. 
[02:30:30]  I asked my wife, how's that feel?  Like nothing.  He's giving you a little stub.  That doesn't sound so bad.  Well, sucks, man, from wall to wall.  107 WNEW.  Hello, Lamb Chop.  I'm free.  I'm free at last.  Free at last.  Thank God almighty. 
[02:31:00]  I'm free at last.  Wait a minute.  What are you talking about?  I thought you liked Sherry Lewis.  And I'm the witch is dead.  What do you mean by that?  Thank God.  Why do you sound so bitter?  She gave you your break in showbiz.  You'd be bitter, too,  if you had to hand up your ass for 20 years.  You wouldn't even take me off  when she went to the bathroom  if you catch my drift.  Ah, come on.  No, and then she thought it was  you calling me f***ing Lamb Chop.  That's like calling a cow meatloaf,  you dystic bitch. 
[02:31:30]  I was the whole act, and she knew it.  We hated each other.  She sucked.  Oh, she's real creative.  I haven't listened to that s*** for 20 years.  Creative?  I'm a f***ing sock.  Good thing she didn't have a condom in her hand  when she thought me up.  Things would look a little different.  Hey, her f***ing lips moved when she talked.  What kind of crap is that?  It's a book to be a ventriloquist,  and your mouth is moving like Monica Lewinsky's. 
[02:32:00]  I'm a 45-cent sock from Woolworths  that she made a f***ing fortune off of,  and I didn't get dicks.  Lamb Chop, what's in your future?  I'm going to be in a couple of new films.  Yeah?  That Lamb Chop sucks a big d***,  and shove your fist in my ass.  And my career's flying,  that f***ing bitch.  All right, Lamb Chop,  I better let you go more and some more. 
[02:32:30]  All right, bye-bye, kids.  Bye.  All right, it's Lamb Chop, everyone.  All right, it's Opie and Anthony,  Jay Moore in the studio,  a bunch of girls on hold 
[02:33:00]  that want to rub their you-know-what.  Guess what I got.  Guess what I got in my pants today.  Brand new game.  Brand new game on the ONA show.  I have your friends nestite to call up.  Nah, nah, nah.  Rub, rub, clang.  And we're going to get Buddy Hackett on the line  to help us out.  He's going to bet all the way from L.A.  My father's college roommate  was at the second show Sunday at Rascals.  Yeah.  And he showed me a picture of my father's,  showed me pictures of my father in college,  and he goes,  you know Buddy Hackett, 
[02:33:30]  you know, like how you were,  you were completely star-struck.  Yeah, because I love Buddy Hackett.  Well, this guy's like Buddy's age  and loves him, you know?  And he goes,  I remember I was drunk  coming out of the Waldorf Astoria,  and a cab was in front of me,  so I punched the cab,  and I heard a voice that said,  what are you going to hit a cab for?  Are you just going to hurt your hand?  And I looked up,  and it's Buddy Hackett.  And I asked for his autograph,  blah, blah, blah,  and I go,  well, let's call him right now.  And the guy's face goes white,  and I put Buddy on speakerphone,  and I go,  Buddy, you're never going to guess  who I have here.  He goes,  let me guess.  I go,  you're never going to guess.  He goes,  is it a man or a woman? 
[02:34:00]  I go,  it's a man.  He goes,  well,  I go,  you're never going to guess.  He goes,  well,  then who is it?  I go,  it's my father's college roommate.  He goes,  oh,  you mean Al?  Do you remember?  No,  he made it,  he's just funny.  I put him on the phone  with the guy  for like five minutes,  and then he hangs up the phone,  and he gives me the phone,  and Buddy goes,  Jay?  I go,  yeah,  he goes,  that's not him.  He was taller. 
[02:34:30]  Buddy Hackett.  What are you doing  with them Opie and Anthony guys?  Hey,  Buddy,  what's up?  It's Jay.  Hey,  yeah,  I know.  You're on the air.  How's everything  in Mayberry,  Opie?  All right,  Buddy,  come on.  He never heard that one,  buddy.  That's the first time,  Buddy.  Yeah,  you know,  Andy Griffiths  was a good friend of mine.  Yeah?  What happened?  He's still alive,  right?  Well,  you start to get fat.  There's no sense  two fat guys  hanging out together. 
[02:35:00]  Hey,  Buddy,  you're going to love  what we hooked up  today for you.  What do you got?  We got girls on the phone  that are rubbing  the receiver end,  the speaking end  of their phone  on their crotches,  and we're playing a game,  and we're all guessing  if they're shaved  into a mohawk,  a triangle,  or a Hitler Mustang.  Never mind that.  I like to sell them  new underwear.  He sees a business  opportunity.  He's a crafty man  to hack it. 
[02:35:30]  How are you,  bud?  I'm all right.  We sure,  the joke you gave me  killed every show  you,  Buddy,  for this.  I got another one  for you.  All right.  You ready?  Yeah.  Wait,  okay,  yeah.  A guy said to his friend  he's going to Mallorca,  he said,  do you speak Spanish?  He said,  no.  He said,  just speak very,  very slowly.  They'll think  you're speaking Spanish.  He said to the clerk,  I want a room.  The clerk,  would you like a view? 
[02:36:00]  The tourist,  yes.  The tourist,  where are you from?  The clerk,  Ohio.  The tourist,  do you speak English?  The clerk,  yes,  I do.  The tourist,  then,  why are we  speaking Spanish?  Ladies and gentlemen 
[02:36:30]  of New York,  Connecticut,  New Jersey,  and Philly.  Buddy Hackett,  my friend.  Are you going to  tell that tonight?  I'll have a show  on that.  I'm resting my voice  by going on the radio  for two hours.  Yeah,  well.  I'll tell it in Boston.  I'm up in Boston next.  What place?  The Comedy Connection  at Faneuil Hall.  Oh,  Faneuil Hall,  yes.  That used to be  a good place  to eat years ago.  It still is.  It still is,  yeah.  They redid the whole place.  I was there  for four months  in 1946.  That's when you  met Brando,  right?  Yeah, 
[02:37:00]  me and Brando  hanged out.  He was at  the Plymouth Theater.  He told Tallulah,  not Tallulah,  he told,  oh,  I forget her name.  Would you have a stroke?  What happened?  Yeah,  it was Tallulah.  Oh,  okay.  He said,  oh,  tell that story.  That's a great one.  Tallulah Bankhead.  Tallulah Bankhead.  Yeah,  in the middle of the show,  he looked at it  and he said,  you have the worst breath.  And that night  he was replaced  by an actor  named Helmut Dantine.  And I said,  I said,  he learned a part 
[02:37:30]  on the train  coming up.  They called him  and told him  while the show  was still on,  they called him,  he took a train  up from New York  and played  the evening performance.  But Marlon  started hanging out  in my place  going with a girl  named Gina Belkin.  I believe  they were doing  all sorts of naughties.  So he got fired  for telling the star  that she had  bad breath on stage.  Well,  she got rid of him  somehow.  Wow.  Hey,  look at me.  I got fired last week  just for telling him  a funny line  to put in the show. 
[02:38:00]  For the listeners,  Buddy Hackett  was to appear  on King of Queens  and Buddy showed up  Monday  and had some great ideas.  Thought maybe his character  should speak in Yiddish  with subtitles.  No,  no,  I didn't tell them that.  I told them that.  I'm just telling you  what I heard,  Buddy.  Well,  I told them that  on the phone  when I first got the job  I told the agent.  The agent called them  and they called me  and said,  they don't even  want to hear that.  So I just had lived  a couple of jokes  in English  and then...  Well,  why didn't they  want you on the show? 
[02:38:30]  I think that would have  been a pretty big  ratings for them.  Well,  what they said was,  their reason was  that I was intimidating  because my persona  was too big  for the part.  I said,  how about my ass?  I think that's  what did it.  Hey,  so Buddy,  you want to play  What's in Your Path?  You want to guess  how these go?  Oh,  sure.  Okay.  Is that a way?  One of the triangle  mohawk  or what?  Or Hitler mustache.  Or Hitler mustache.  A Hitler mustache.  Yeah. 
[02:39:00]  Let's start.  I would like to meet  a girl that wears  her muff  and her Hitler mustache.  Yeah.  Yes.  Wears her muff.  And you just yell,  Hiya Hump.  Hey,  Lynn.  Yeah.  This is the best radio  there's ever been.  We got Buddy Hackett  3,000 miles away  guessing bush.  How are you,  how are you,  Lynn?  I'm all right.  This is Linda,  but that's all right.  Oh,  Linda,  I'm sorry. 
[02:39:30]  Hi,  Linda,  you're on the air.  Hello.  Hi,  Linda.  Hi,  buddy.  Hi,  Jay.  What city are you in?  Oh,  I'm not in this city.  I'm in Jersey.  Jersey.  That's what I'm asking.  Which city are you in?  He's going to hear it.  Jersey has no cities.  Yeah,  I used to be a cop  in Fort Lee.  Oh,  well,  I'm here.  I'm a saic.  Don't make him mad.  You'll fall out of a window.  Saic.  Oh,  God.  All right.  Well,  Lynn,  are your pants off?  Oh,  of course.  And you got the phone?  Oh,  yes.  All right.  You got to rub pretty hard  so we can hear it  through the phone,  okay?  Pretty hard.  No,  it's like Jimmy Valentine. 
[02:40:00]  Can I think of Jay Moore  while I'm doing it?  Oh,  yeah.  Oh,  he's so hot.  You just got hotter.  Can you tell Buddy Hackett  how hot he is as well,  Buddy Hackett?  Yeah.  You are just incredibly hot.  I would love to  take your skin,  unwrinkle it,  Yeah.  and lick every inch of it.  Yeah.  Could we make that retroactive  about 53 years  so I can do it?  All right.  All right.  The big Barry Katz,  the big Jew, 
[02:40:30]  just added something  to the equation.  Oh,  okay.  What about completely bald?  Of course.  Right.  Well,  that's going to be obvious.  I can guarantee you  I'm not completely bald.  All right.  You can't help us.  No help.  No help.  We're going to let Buddy  have the first guest.  So,  Lynn,  when you're ready,  All right.  Buddy,  listen closely.  She will now rub.  Okay.  Hold on.  Okay.  Oh,  my God.  Okay.  Lynn,  one more time.  I don't need it  another time. 
[02:41:00]  How about it?  All right.  All right.  Very natural  in the center,  trimmed on the side.  And,  uh,  you must have  gone out  with a fireman  because there's a  brass button  at the end.  Don't say it.  Don't say anything.  That was very cute.  But don't give it,  don't let it know  if he's right or not,  Lynn.  Yeah,  well,  all right,  Lynn.  All right,  so here's four separate times 
[02:41:30]  for you guys.  That was Buddy's guess.  Very natural.  Okay,  now,  uh,  Don't give us any clues.  And,  uh,  I guess who's up next?  He must have dated a fireman  because he's got a brass hand.  No,  that's sick  because my father's a fireman.  Oh,  my God.  That's where Buddy lives.  All right,  Lynn,  they're freaking me out.  All right,  Lynn,  one more rub there.  One more rub.  One?  I'm going to give you one more.  Well,  who's up?  The rest of us.  We just want to hear one more time.  All right,  all right.  Hold on. 
[02:42:00]  Oh,  yeah,  that's long.  Okay.  Yeah,  I'm thinking Ulysses Grant long.  I'm going to go.  No,  it's not Ulysses Grant long.  Uh-uh,  don't say anything.  Lynn,  you've got to play by the rules.  I mean,  okay,  it's like 30 girls on hold,  Lynn.  Don't break the rules.  Can I go?  Yeah,  so I go.  I'm going to say,  I'm going to say,  pool rack filled with afro hair.  Thank you,  cowbell bell.  Pool rack filled with afro hair. 
[02:42:30]  I'm going to say the same.  Really?  I think,  I'm going more with a couple of pieces of silly putty slapped together,  thrown on the barbershop floor.  And Lynn,  what's in your pants?  See,  let's see what would be the closest to that.  Obviously,  natural,  big.  It's natural,  but it's triangle.  Yeah.  That's what I said.  That's natural.  Buddy said natural,  trims on the sides.  Yeah.  Yeah,  trims on the sides.  I'm not going to,  you know,  go with hairy down my legs or anything. 
[02:43:00]  No,  no,  we didn't mean that,  but the hair is,  even though it's a triangle,  it's,  it's a,  it's a big triangle.  It's a big triangle.  My boyfriend likes it natural.  It's a pool rack.  So we all win.  Yeah.  Anthony.  All right.  To run his fingers through it.  Oh my God.  Harry.  You know,  when I first heard it,  I thought it was a hat for a guy who graduated from Rutgers.  We all win.  Anthony's down in the hole now.  Yeah.  Damn.  All right.  I'm undefeated,  baby.  Let's go to,  let's go to Crystal.  That can be a fun one. 
[02:43:30]  Crystal.  Hi.  Are you ready to play?  What's the,  what's in your pants?  Of course.  Okay.  You got to think of a better name.  Really?  You want to say hi to Buddy Hackett,  the,  the famous Buddy Hackett,  the legend?  Oh,  hello,  Crystal.  Dear,  how are you?  Very well.  I certainly hope to enjoy you someday as I did your mother and your grandmother.  Oh my God.  Crystal,  is that your real name or your escort name?  No,  that's really my name. 
[02:44:00]  All right.  You got your pants down?  Well,  I got to pull over if you can give me a second.  Oh,  you need to pull over.  She's in a car.  You're in a car?  Yeah.  You should have pulled over while you were in a car.  What highway are you on?  I'm on the New Jersey Carmphite.  All right.  You hear that,  guys?  If you see anybody pulling over,  help her.  It's a girl that has her pants down.  All right.  Are you pulled over?  She wants someone to help.  She wants someone to help her.  She wants someone to help her.  She wants someone to help her.  Could you imagine if a cop comes over and she's got the phone down there on her pants  and he says to me,  don't tell me you're making a phone call. 
[02:44:30]  For all the listeners,  you absolutely,  it's a moratorium.  It's forbidden.  You may not interrupt Buddy Hackett.  You can interrupt anybody.  Absolutely.  When Hackett speaks,  people listen.  No stepping on Hackett.  No stepping on the master.  All right.  All right,  Crystal.  Whoa.  All right.  We can do it again.  Yeah,  one more time.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Have you got a sheep in the car? 
[02:45:00]  I'm going to guess first.  Buddy guesses first.  I think you win a case of Woolite.  All right,  Buddy,  what do you think?  I think there's nothing done.  It's just very,  very normal the way it is.  And it hasn't been trimmed or shaped or anything.  Very natural.  All right.  Completely natural.  I say she is a very tiny Mohawk. 
[02:45:30]  Oh,  really?  Going with the Mohawk.  Like a two-finger Mohawk.  Yeah,  yeah.  But a long one.  Yeah.  Like an aircraft carrier.  Yeah,  I'm going to go with the aircraft carrier,  too.  You should just gravy train  and everything else.  No,  I didn't go with you last time.  I'm going to go fine-trimmed two-finger Mohawk.  Same as me.  Yeah.  So,  Buddy says natural,  and the three of us say Mohawk.  A bunch of people  saying Hitler must say.  No,  screw them,  they can't play.  All right,  Crystal?  Mohawk. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  It's a Mohawk.  I'm three for three,  everybody.  Yeah.  Jay Moore,  Bush expert.  I guess  I'm only talking from memory.  Buddy,  back in your day,  girls didn't really shave  into a Mohawk,  did they?  Who knows?  We didn't even know  they had fur there.  Didn't you look?  Not in the dark.  No one went around  in the light.  Really?  If you just set them up, 
[02:46:30]  he'll knock them down.  Don't worry,  Anthony.  We need a scorecard.  We got to keep track of this.  You and I are even.  Get a blank piece of paper.  You and I are even.  You guys are two and L.  Buddy and I are one and one.  Oh, no,  you got three,  I got two wins.  You're two for one.  And Buddy and Anthony got one.  Hold on,  let me write this down.  O.P.  All right,  let's go to,  let's go to Joanie.  Joanie,  say hi to Buddy Hackett.  Hi,  Buddy Hackett.  Hello,  Joanie,  how are you?  I'm great.  Yeah,  are you cold?  I'm really cold. 
[02:47:00]  You're not too big.  All right,  Joanie,  are you cold?  Oh,  listen to that phone.  Joanie,  I hope that isn't the sound  that's making for you.  Jesus Christ.  You might want to see  a gynecologist.  All right,  Joanie.  Yeah.  Okay,  are you in a car  or where are you?  I'm at home  in my living room.  Oh,  nice.  And your pants are off?  Yeah,  I'm actually a Rutgers student  for that girl  who was calling before.  Oh,  very good,  okay.  Oh,  it's going around.  Yep.  And since you're at home,  do you live alone?  No,  I live with my boyfriend  and my best friend. 
[02:47:30]  Are you alone now?  No,  my boyfriend's here too.  Okay,  so what you could do for us  and for the listeners  that drive and get horny daily  on the O.P. and Anthony show,  since it's just you  and your boyfriend  and your pants are off  and your underpants are off,  right?  Right,  right.  I think you should just  spread them really wide  on the couch.  Okay.  And that is hot.  Okay.  Buddy,  what do you think?  Good idea,  right?  Well,  you know,  I'm always in favor of that  because I used to be  an upholsterer. 
[02:48:00]  And every time a couch  gets a little syrup on it,  we get to do it over.  Oh,  man.  All right,  Joanie,  you got the phone.  Okay.  Let's give it a good rub.  Okay,  get ready.  Okay.  Got it.  Got it.  He's all cocky now.  That's easy.  That's easy.  Buddy,  you're up.  I think it's just  she's faking us out  with a Brillo pad. 
[02:48:30]  Let me ask you guys  a question.  Yeah.  Has a sound  come out of his mouth  that wasn't  10 for 10 for me?  Everything he said  is on fire.  You're on fire today,  buddy.  Thanks.  Okay,  Jay,  it's to you.  Let me hear it again.  What's your name again?  Joanie.  Joanie.  Did you spread them  really wide?  Yeah.  Okay.  That confused me.  Okay,  I'll spread it more.  Hold on.  Okay,  I got it. 
[02:49:00]  Are you using the phone?  Yeah,  I'm using the phone.  I got it.  Are you hitting  somebody's head?  My boyfriend says  he wants to rub it  on his way.  No,  thank you.  I know.  All right,  Jay,  it's to you.  Wow.  Well,  I don't want to,  I'm 3 and 0,  so.  Yeah,  you don't want to  screw up now.  She's bald.  Wow,  you're going for a  bald thing.  Oh,  God,  I tie you here.  I'm going,  I'm going,  I'm going,  I'm going,  triangle,  finely trimmed. 
[02:49:30]  All right,  buddy.  Don't say buddy  for last.  Go on.  I don't know,  I said it already.  He said the Brillo pad.  I thought he'd take  the shot with a Brillo pad.  You're going for  Yul Brynner there.  Yeah,  I'm,  I'm going to go with  Hitler mustache.  Okay,  so you ready?  Yeah,  I'm laughing at  Hitler mustache.  It's Wood Floor.  Wood Floor.  She's bald.  Four feet.  Oh,  my God.  Are you serious?  Jay Moore.  The guy can't lose. 
[02:50:00]  Hey,  buddy,  have you,  have you come across  hairless in your day?  No,  never have.  No.  What about men?  I don't know  what I feel about  them dudes.  Them dudes.  All right,  Joni,  thank you.  Okay,  thanks a lot.  Bye-bye.  All right.  I got food  and everyone  else is stuck  at two.  Yeah,  we got to take  a break.  You know something?  You screwed me up  because I was going  to say ball,  but I didn't want  you going,  oh,  look,  you're just  latching on.  Go for what  you know,  man.  Yeah. 
[02:50:30]  That was good.  But are you  going to hang  with us for a while  or?  No,  I think I'm  going to get off  and go take  a few of them  injections to see  if you get  an erection.  I'm going to  tell you something,  I've been on  a lot of  radio  shows you.  The last time  I did one,  you weren't  allowed to say  I pulled a hair  out of my nose,  so could you  imagine?  It's been a long  time.  Oh,  now forget about it.  The whole world  has changed.  Wow.  You like it,  right,  buddy?  Do I like it? 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  Yeah,  I want to get  in on it.  It was guys  like you  that paved  the way,  pal.  A little bit,  yes,  I did.  All right,  buddy.  I remember  asking a woman  in the front  show,  I said,  could you  show us  your bosom?  And she said,  no,  I said,  we're only  curious,  could you  just show  one?  And she  wouldn't do  that either,  so that was  very bold  in those days.  All right,  Matt.  Buddy,  we love you,  man.  I love you. 
[02:51:30]  Love you guys  all.  God,  have a wonderful  life,  but I think  you've got a  hell of a jump  on the rest  of us.  All right,  buddy.  Thank you,  buddy.  There he goes.  A legend.

[02:55:30]  All right.  Great reviews from  everyone.  The worst of Opie and  Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Diarrhea wave hits  prisons.  Supper blame.  In Kingston Jamaica.  Jamaican prison.  Jamaican prison.  That's got to be some  great accommodations  they got there in a  Jamaican prison huh? 
[02:56:00]  And all the inmates  getting diarrhea because  of bad supper.  A mass outbreak of  diarrhea has hit two  Jamaican prisons with  more than a thousand  convicts suffering.  Doctors are struggling  frantically to contain  the outbreak which  inmates have blamed on  their Sunday supper.  The Sunday supper just  in case you're wondering.  Yeah.  Spicy crab.  Spicy crab soup.  Spicy crab soup.  Chinese cabbage. 
[02:56:30]  Chakotai.  Chinese cabbage.  Rice peas and chicken.  No no they didn't have  the rice peas and  chicken.  Sunday meal.  Sunday meal of rice  peas and chicken.  Opie you're getting  the story wrong.  I preach it kind of  oh they should have got  the rice peas and  chicken but instead they  got the spicy crab soup  and the Chinese cabbage.  Cabbage and some kind  of vegetable taro.  Taro.  Whatever that is.  And uh...  Oh no. 
[02:57:00]  Diarrhea cha-cha-cha.  Yeah yeah yeah.  Angry prisoners on  Monday dump scores of  paper bags loaded with  feces in passageways to  the cell blocks in  protest.  That's great.  So they have the bad  supper.  Everyone has diarrhea.  Now they're putting the  diarrhea in paper bags.  You know what's great?  You go to a zoo and  look at the monkeys.  What do they do?  They crap in their hand  and throw it at the  people that are standing  outside the cages. 
[02:57:30]  Correct.  Doesn't sound like much  different is happening  in these Jamaican prisons.  No.  Oh my god.  Throwing their feces at  people because they get  diarrhea.  That's great.  Now the treatment was  hampered because some  prisoners refused to come  out of their cells for  medication fearing attacks  from other inmates.  A special security team  was going to cells to  give inmates on the spot  treatment if needed.  This medical team had to  go from cell to cell to  give them treatment as  there's diarrhea all over 
[02:58:00]  their cells.  I heard one clever inmate  lit the bag on fire in  front of the warden's  door, knocked and ran  away.  That old gag.  Alright so they're  working overtime to  pinpoint the source of  the epidemic.  Oh there you have it.  A thousand convicts in  Kingston, Jamaica.  Suffering from diarrhea  Anthony.  Diarrhea.  After a bad Sunday  suffering.  All right. 
[02:58:30]  We're clapping.  Clapping all over you.  Hey!  We're clapping.  Climbing.  Climbing.  Climbing.  Climbing.  Climbing.  Climbing.  Climbing.  Climbing.  Climbing.  I will see you through

[03:01:00]  An outbreak of diarrhea.  Taste things you make, Anthony.  Oh.  Hello, we're dropping.  Okay, terrific.  Yeah.  It must not be very... 
[03:01:30]  You know how it sucks when you have diarrhea anyway, and you're in the best of conditions.  Imagine that, a Jamaican prison.  You're losing it.  All right.  Don't get those fart noises.  David, what's up, man?  Yo, O&A, how are you doing, guys?  Good, what's up, David?  Yeah, I've got to figure it out.  I know what happened in Jamaica.  The warden was at the bottom of it.  He wanted to put an end to all of the gay sex going on there.  Hey!  And that would definitely put a damper on it.  Hey! 
[03:02:00]  Yeah, that would wreck the party, wouldn't it?  Absolutely.  You suck.  Keep it up.  All right, David.  The whole prison looked like the mud people from Woodstock.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  What's up?  This is me.  Jesus.  Whoa.  I didn't believe that's the end.  You suck.  It is Opie and Anthony.  Hello.  How are you guys?  Thanks for joining us. 
[03:02:30]  There you go.  Hillary Clinton has announced that she's officially running, Anthony.  What a surprise.  For the Senate seat.  Jeez, does that mean we don't have to put the bill anymore for every trip she makes here?  What?  Oh.  So finally she announced, and what does that mean?  What does she do now?  Well, she had her speech yesterday.  Check that out.  Mm-hmm.  She pretty much wants to solve every single problem facing the world.  Where will that money come from?  The working slob. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, she...  I'm getting scared.  I'm getting scared.  I think she's going to win this damn election.  No.  It scares the crap out of me.  No.  I think there's enough stupid people out there that's going to push her over the top, Anthony.  I still think Rudy's...  Rudy has a narrow lead at this point.  Narrow lead.  I don't know.  They haven't started the mudslinging commercials yet, really.  There'll be some great ones.  She couldn't keep tabs on her husband's affairs. 
[03:03:30]  Are you going to elect her to take care of yours?  Paid for it by friends of Rudy Jolie, Anthony.  Hey, Dave, what's going on?  Hey, they both suck, okay?  Yeah, okay.  I cannot think of...  I can't think of who I dislike more.  Yeah, that's a great way to look at it.  Everybody in New York thinks Rudy's like a big bully.  I mean, he gets things done, but he's like this big bully, and you don't do it my way.  I'll just push you around until I get what I want.  Yeah.  Okay, so that's Rudy's side of it. 
[03:04:00]  Now, you take Hillary, and she doesn't know a damn thing about what she's doing here.  Doesn't have a clue.  The only reason she's in New York is because New York will let her, without being a true resident, run for Senate, right?  Correct.  She doesn't get into the Senate.  Bill is history, too.  How long do you think he'll be around?  I hope a while.  Bill, I want to see him do stuff.  I know.  We all want to see him around.  God damn, I want to see him just party his ass off when he gets out of office.  Oh, it's going to be interesting after he leaves office.  It's great material, but...  Something's going to go horribly wrong with that guy. 
[03:04:30]  I mean, everybody in New York has got to lose their mind to vote Hillary in, though.  Well, I'm starting to worry about this one.  And that's an insult to New Yorkers, isn't it?  Maybe that'll be the way Bill will get back at Hillary, like for being such a bitch to him and not giving him any, and stuff like that.  He'll just treat her like crap and ruin her name.  You know what I mean?  That'll be fun.  Like, she'll be trying to be this legitimate politician, and he'll just go out and bang chicks and hang out in the booby bars. 
[03:05:00]  Wouldn't that be a great episode of Cops?  All of a sudden, a cop gets a call.  We have a domestic dispute in Capcom.  And Bill just comes out with his wife-beater t-shirt on.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  All hammered.  What the hell do you think?  She comes home all hours.  You know, she had drunk and everything.  Yeah, I had a girl in the house, but we wasn't doing nothing.  All stained like this wife-beater guinea tea all stained up and everything. 
[03:05:30]  Comes out of the house.  All right, Mr. President, please go back in the house.  Mr. President, back in the house.  You can't make me do anything.  It's my house.  My house.  I don't care what that bitch says.  F you, man.  F you.  All right, we need back up here.  All right.  One more time and you're going in.  One more time, Mr. President.  Hey, go out for yourself.  Okay, against the car.  Against the car.  Yeah, what do you do?  I didn't do nothing.  I didn't do nothing. 
[03:06:00]  That would be great, man.  That would be hilarious.  Very good, man.  Come in the house.  He's just sitting there with his hand down his pants watching TV.  What?  What?  Drinking.  And then the car.  He's got a big bruise on her eye.  He beat me.  And then the cop's asking Clinton if he was drinking tonight.  Been drinking.  I might have had it.  Here's my house.  My business.  I'm the president.  God damn it.  Go screw yourself.  I'll have your job.  What's your badge, man?  I would laugh my ass off, cops. 
[03:06:30]  A little cop driving back, you know.  How do I arrest the president today?  You know, you never know what a day is going to bring this job.  Cops.  Get away from my house.  And the bitch deserved it.  I don't know what you're talking about.  This is my house.  My house.  God damn it.  I was the president. 
[03:07:00]  Get back in your car, you pig.  He tries to stab her with a steak knife.  Get your hands.  F you, man.  F you.  Did you ever see the cops episode where the guy got his ear cut off by his wife?  Yeah.  And they had to find the ear?  Yeah.  That was great.  That show rocked.  Cops.  So I had a chick in the house.  She didn't have to get all effing up about it.  I don't understand.  Mr. President, you know, your wife's very upset.  Why don't maybe, you know, you could leave the household tonight. 
[03:07:30]  They will take you somewhere.  F you, my house.  That bitch don't like it.  She could leave.  I never wanted to move to New York anyway.  You go screw yourself.  Mr. President, if you keep my mouth off, I'm going to have to take in.  Take me and go eff yourself.  That bitch, I'll smack her again.  Okay, Mr. President, get the cock.  Point it back up.  The President's running.  The President's running.  He's on the run down the street.  Down that street.  What you going to do? 
[03:08:00]  Get the helicopter on him.  Get the helicopter on him.  You got nothing on me.  And they have to tackle him.  He's like trying to get over a fence and they set the dogs out there.  Or they, or they, get away, get away.  Come on.  Or it.  Or my favorite thing on cops.  Like they lose them for a little while and then like all of a sudden they shine the light  up in the tree and there's the President hiding in the tree.  Or they kick over the kid pool and Clinton's hiding underneath him. 
[03:08:30]  What?  I didn't do nothing.  What?  We can all look forward to that if she does win.  That could be cool.  The cop out of breath jumping over the neighborhood fences.  The President is in custody.  I need a car over here.  Well, Mr. President ran down the street.  I took chase.  He tried to make it over the fence.  But a few, too many trips to McDonald's. 
[03:09:00]  The extra weight.  I was able to bring him down pretty easy.  And put the President in custody.  A few, man.  Hitting his head against the police car window.  A few.  Trying to kick it out.  The stained guinea tea on.  You tell that bitch I ain't coming back.  He throws something away while he's running away from the cops.  We found these bits of crack.  The President's running is testing positive as crack cocaine. 
[03:09:30]  Mr. President, you got anything in your pockets now?  I didn't do it.  It wasn't mine.  I was holding it for Chelsea.  It almost makes you want to have her win, doesn't it?  I love it.  Trying to kick the back window out.  Running with cuffs on. 
[03:10:00]  Or he gets on his little bike.  That's always good at cops, too.  As far as he gets on a bike, he tries to get away from the cops.  He's running.  He's running.  I wasn't running.  What?  What?  And they try to...  They're so obviously guilty.  And then they catch him.  They come and they're like,  What?  What?  Episode of President of the United States. 
[03:10:30]  What'd I do?  Very nice.  She's a fat bitch.  Look at that ass.  Cot.  Brought to you with the co-operations of men and women of blondes.  F you.  F you.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[03:11:00]  So pay attention, asshole.  1027.  WNEW.  Alrighty, what's happening, guys?  It is not Opie or Anthony.  It's just me.  That's Rick.  What's happening?  Doing the worst of Opie and Anthony all week this week.  You're just getting in your car, just tuning in, just checking it out, and not realizing  what's going on.  You've got an opportunity to suggest bits that you want to hear, man.  Some of your favorite stuff that they've done over the last three months is mainly what 
[03:11:30]  we're sticking to.  But of course, if you've got some great stuff from like the last year and a half or so,  maybe a bit off their Demented World CD like Green Poopies, try and get that on in just  a little bit.  In the meantime, getting tons of requests for this next bit, which I didn't think it was  that huge.  You guys liked it that much.  But man, between the instant feedback and the phone calls and a few faxes, the CBS FM bit  is getting a lot, a lot, a lot of requests.  So we're going to take care of it right now. 
[03:12:00]  Hang tight, sit back, and enjoy.  This is just, this is real funny.  So check it out if you haven't heard it before.  It's CBS FM.  Today, you're stuck with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  107 WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  This is 1027 WNEW.  212-757-1027 if you have anything.  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  What's going on?  All right. 
[03:12:30]  Listen, you guys better rip up Bob Shannon up on 101.  Why?  Because he was just ripping you guys up.  I was flipping through the station while you guys were on break.  Yeah.  And he said that they were in the newspaper that they just cloned them to monkeys.  Uh-huh.  Because now that you guys, now that you have somebody to take your guys' place, you guys  should take a break.  Oh, that's pretty funny.  Everybody talking about the Opie and Anthony Show.  We don't mind.  We don't care.  Keep talking.  All right, guys.  Later.  Thank you.  CBS taking jabs at us?  Yep.  Isn't that the, that's oldies, right? 
[03:13:00]  That's the, that's the elephant graveyard.  Yeah.  That's where like the old, that's where the old jocks go to die.  Hello.  Oh, love.  CBS now.  We must be getting popular.  CBS is now taking shots at us.  Donald, what's up?  How could they even do that?  Isn't that just the music station?  Don't they have like strict rules?  Who knows?  You know, you're supposed to just seg the songs, shut up, maybe talk about how cold it is out  and go to the next, uh, Shirelle's song or something?  You have to go around the corner.  Hey, Donald, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  I was just listening to CBS. 
[03:13:30]  My uncle had it on.  He said, uh, that they cloned twin monkeys.  Yeah.  And, uh, he said, Opie and Anthony can take a vacation now.  Ha, ha, ha.  Keep talking about us.  That's pretty funny, though.  I can't believe it.  You guys are great, man.  Thank you.  You got to give them something because that's a pretty funny line.  It's a funny line, but if you're going to try to like get to us, you got to come up  with something a little bit more than that.  CBS FM!  Hey!  Oh, wow!  Look, they cloned a couple of monkeys.  It looks like Opie and Anthony could be taking a vacation. 
[03:14:00]  Hey, get some CBS, uh, music.  We'll, we'll do it how they did it.  Probably in between records because they only get like 15 seconds to do their shtick, Anthony,  you know?  Yeah, let's see if we can talk it up like, uh, like they do over there.  I wish we had the echo.  We need the massive echo chamber.  Oh, where it sounds like you're like, uh, playing basketball in the gym.  Yeah, you're on a radio show at the same time.  Yeah, you're on a basketball court, it sounds like.  All right.  Wow.  Hello, love!  We don't have that, though.  I don't know why they do that. 
[03:14:30]  God, we must be pissing off just everybody in this business.  Well, our pals at the radio message board, the industry, uh, little dumping ground.  Right.  For all the people, all weekend long and today.  Once again, we're just the, the popular post.  All right, Ant, you want to be the CBS, uh, FM DJ?  What song is it?  Dissing us, Joy to the World?  Oh, yeah?  Guess that you have to do it right up to the post, Anthony.  Okay, I'll try.  Hey, CBS FM, it's Harry Balls here. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, this is a short intro.  Yeah, we need a, I need a long intro.  We need a much longer intro than that, right?  I can't, I can't say who I am, the station, and rag us.  Yeah, we gotta, how about a little, uh...  Hey, Harry Balls here, CBS FM.  You know, I'm reading they cloned a couple of monkeys and the music's coming in now.  We don't have enough time.  We got one?  Gotta have a long intro.  No, no, we needed like 15 seconds.  Hey, everybody. 
[03:15:30]  Harry Snatch with you, CBS FM.  I'm reading in the paper today that they cloned a couple of monkeys.  Looks like Opie and Anthony gonna be able to take a vacation.  The Hollies!  Blonde Cold Woman in a Black Dress.  This one taking you right back to September 1972.  Yeah, that's not bad.  Yeah, yeah.  Bravo.  Didn't have any more to babble.  All right, well, you want to do like a little, uh, weather break?  Do a quick, quick weather break.  You don't have much time here.

Your testicles are gonna be sticking to your ass crack.  I've lost my friggin' mind working here at CBS FM.  Ho-ho! 
[03:16:30]  How you doing, people?  Remember, it's really cold outside.  So, uh, put on a sweater, or you'll end up break down.  It's like opiate anthony.  Look, I'm talkin' over the music.  I'm gonna get fired.  Ha-ha!  Miss Taberay, man!  Miss Taberay, man!  I like the Shacker version better.  See, we got that back!  Ha-ha!  All right, you're gettin' better as we go along here.  Ha-ha!  What the hell is this? 
[03:17:00]  Ho-ho!  Gypsy, sluts, and whores!  On CBS!  I've gone in the wagon of a traveling show.  My mama used to...  That's all they get to say, though.  Like, that's pretty much the gig over there.  You just gotta...  You gotta do everything you've ever wanted to say in your life  in, like, three seconds.  Well, then she wouldn't be tired of...  You don't even get a chance there.  Oh, that one, you know.  Here, try this one.  Hey, everybody. 
[03:17:30]  Harry Sack with ya.  On CBS FM.  You know, they clothed a couple of monkeys,  and I can't talk about it,  because the music started.  I wish I was over at N.E.W.  See, he had...  No, they don't give a crap.  He had to pick the perfect song to do it.  Yeah.  I think this one would do it for you.  Here you go.  Hold on, there.  Hey, everybody.  Harry Sack with ya.  Coming up next,  nine-year-old boys with no teeth.  Next on CBS FM.  Hey!  Oh!

[03:18:30]  CBS FM.  Incentive peppermint.  Drop me your lawnmuck.  I got my finger in my ass.  CBS.  CBS.  Oh, these boots are made for walking  or sticking in my butt crack.  That's the Sinatra CBS FM.  You keep saying you've got something for me. 
[03:19:00]  You have a question for me.  You have a question for me.  You have a question for me.  What a tool.  Keep talking about us.  We can't care less.  That is a talent, though.  You've got to give them that.  Uno, dos.  One, two, tres, cuatro.  Oh, everybody.  Harry Snatch with you.  Wooly, wooly, that's how I like my girls 
[03:19:30]  with a big, hairy gash.  CBS FM.  Hey, everybody.  Dick goes in, in you.  We're going to be happy together with the turtles.  Uh-oh.  I screwed up again.  Hey, Dick goes in, in you. 
[03:20:00]  Here on CBS FM with the Bumpcase.  Wow, that was an easy one.  Hey, cream in your snatch here.  On CBS FM, I like hairless 10-year-olds.  On CBS FM. 
[03:20:30]  Oh, it's windy outside, isn't it?  And pretty cold.  Make sure you wear your sweater.  I like catching, uh, catching hummers.  I'm catching one right now under the console  from windy CBS. 
[03:21:00]  I can get a job over there, right?  I think you can, man.  As long as you can goof on stupid stuff.  You've just got to say inane crap  in between all the crappy music.  Hey, everybody.  Harry Crotch with you.  And, uh...  Oh, I was just looking at the name of the song.  Well, it's a tricky job.  I keep stepping on the words 
[03:21:30]  because I'm diddling myself.  C-B-S.  That's some gig they got over there, though.  But if all you had to do  is, like, during the music,  plan out what you're going to say over the...  and listen to the beginning of the song 20 times.  Hey, the Osmond brothers!  You know, I'd like to, uh...  I'd like to anally rape the youngest one. 
[03:22:00]  CBS!  Oh, my God.  That's a good one.  Too funny.  Hey, everyone.  Dick Inside you here.

Yeah, you feel the fun,  very nasty.  You hit the post there pretty good.  I try.  I stepped on a little bit.  Okay.  Hey, everyone.  It's your good pal, Phil McCracken.  Over here, CBS FM. 
[03:23:30]  It's the association.  This one taking you way back.  Reminds me of the first time I had a man's unit in my face.  CBS!  He went away and you hung around.  Hey, shut up, bitch.  I gotta talk over you.  I'm not going to go after you.  You said things that weren't there.  Goddamn.  My boyfriend's back  and we're gonna be in trouble.  Hey, line, hey, line. 
[03:24:00]  My boyfriend's black.  Oh, brother.  Yeah, it's the Jackson 5.  CBS FM.  That's when he was a black man  as opposed to when he is now a white woman.  Even Earl's laughing. 
[03:24:30]  Earl, you got the echo?  I just hear static.  Hello, hello, hello?  Nah, it doesn't work that good.  Damn, I wish we had that.  Oh, there it is.  All right, here we go.  Hey, whoa!  Wait a minute.  Very good.  No, make it nice and loud for Andy.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, everyone.  I'm Ron Boss here.  CBS FM.  I'm here in the gymnasium.  And I'm hoping to find a few underage girls. 
[03:25:00]  The band.  CBS.  I can't believe in the music on this, I know.  Yeah, you might remember this one.  Take me right back in 1976.  Oh, John Kiki Dean.  Don't go breaking my heart.  And I remember her yelling,  don't go breaking my climate.  CBS.  CBS. 
[03:25:30]  Hey, Anthony, pass me the ball.  I want to take a couple shots  as we're in this gymnasium doing a radio show.  All right.  Let's play a game of horse.  Okay.  What a joke.  See, even Earl's laughing.  We're all back together, guys.  It's CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS. 
[03:26:00]  Goddamn.  Hello, love.  Hello, love.  Ron Lundy.  Hello, love.  I am BB.  Harry Harrison.  We're getting fired for this one.  All right.  Ready for another one?  You can't rag on the legends.  Where's my echo, goddammit?  Where's the echo for the man?  The man.  Yeah, this will take me back, 1972. 
[03:26:30]  Three Dog Nights, black and white.  Oh, that's how I like them.  Black.  Yeah.  I don't have anything funny to say to that.  I need a good song about, like, effing.  Do that one.  Track one, man.  That's a hit.  That's a CBS FM hit right there.  Black track one over there.  On this one.  Let me turn on your echo for a second.  I love the echo.  Hold on.  We might have to start using that here. 
[03:27:00]  And a W.  John, what's up?  I tell you, I'm laughing so hard.  I'm about to have an angina.  I know it's inside, but that puts me in the same age group as the DJs on CBS.  All right, very good.  Thank you, John.  Here goes John.  All right, turn up Ant's echo again.  Here we go.  Where's my echo?  Hey, is this a live cut?  Yeah.  All right, everyone. 
[03:27:30]  L. John on CBS FM.  I'll tell you the Jets.  You know, on this final of the King's birthday, I'd like to say, I think the Klan has some good ideas.  CBS FM.  Hey, Steve.  Hey, Steve.  Get up.  I'll tell you.  Okay.  Okay.  Hold on.  This one's good.  All right.  Hold on.  Okay.  Okay. 
[03:28:00]  Hey, everyone.  I'm Little Avon's The Walk of Motion.  This one's coming out August 1962.  I'm Buster Hyman.  CBS.  I'd like to give her a walk of motion in the a**.  Andy, what's up?  You guys are killing me.  I run 17, and me and a guy next to me who was obviously listening, because he was laughing 
[03:28:30]  his a** off, too, almost to hit each other on the highway.  Hey, is the echo coming through good?  Yeah.  Are you kidding me?  All right.  Thank you, Andy.  All right.  Bye.  Here we go.  Hey, everyone.  It's Heywood Javomi here on CBS FM.  This one, Billy Preston going back to 1974.  Nothing from nothing.  You know, I think Adolf Hitler was a good guy.  CBS.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nothing from nothing. 
[03:29:00]  He's got to have something.  If you want to be with me.  He's got to get his ideas in quick.  Hey, Frank.  Yeah.  What's up?  Do you guys think this actually is hysterical?  Yes, we do.  Do you think this is really funny?  Yes.  All right.  Call her, Frank.  You're on the air.  This is really...  I've been listening to you guys.  It's about Justin Sider.  I don't think it's funny. 
[03:29:30]  You know, CBS FM is a station that's responsible for bringing rock and roll to this city.  Ho-ho, Frank.  Looks like Hitler missed a few.  CBS.  It's not funny, man.  It's just not funny.  It's not funny.  You're saying it's not funny.  It's not funny.  It's not right, man.  It's just not right.  Is my echo coming through?  Because that's all that matters.  If your echo's coming through, you need a little bit more if you really want to know the truth.  All right, Frank.  You know, how?  What's the beef with that other station?  I don't understand it. 
[03:30:00]  I don't understand it.  Why?  I don't understand it.  Why are you mocking on CBS FM?  And dedicated to him, we'll play just a little understanding.  Take you right back to 1962, Frank.  We understand you.  We're listening here at CBS FM.  What is the purpose of the echo at CBS FM?  CBS.  It's to help enhance my voice so you can't tell them 101, just like our frequency.  101, CBS FM.  God damn. 
[03:30:30]  Rodland, CBS FM.  How you doing, people?  This one's going to bring back some memories of those black exploitation films.  What is this, the deepest swat?  I thought it was sad.  I could talk through the whole thing, because there's no words in this song. 
[03:31:00]  So I could talk it up right to the end.  Hey, let's go touch some children.  CBS.  CBS.  I bet Frank didn't like that one.  Frank that just called in didn't like it, because he's a child-toucher.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  Hey, Jizz, stay with you here on CBS FM. 
[03:31:30]  Reminding everyone, do a public service announcement.  Get those herpes vaccinations, because you don't know who I'm going to be bagging.  Oh, CBS.  CBS.  Hey, Frank Dildo here. 
[03:32:00]  This one's going to be taking you all the way back to 1974.  It's David Hessex.  Rock on.  And boy, I got a rock hard one here at my best.  Just thinking of passing by the junior high school earlier.  CBS FM. 
[03:32:30]  Oh, yeah.  Here we go.  Party like there's no tomorrow.  It's Phil McClacken here at CBS FM.  This one's a jam.  Tequila.  I like drinking a lot of tequila and sticking my member where his husband belongs.  Maybe that's not a little of your own keister.  Let's go out and sip some young panties.  Come on with me.  It's CBS FM.  Yeah, Harry's back here. 
[03:33:00]  It's Paul Anka.  Lonely boy.  I'm pretty lonely, too.  I'm just a lonely boy.  Uh-oh.  I ran out of music there, hoping.  What would happen if that actually happened on CBS FM?  I just keep talking.  I'm so lonely.  I got blue balls.  CBS.  CBS.  I've got it.  Hey, it's wake up little Susie, the Emily brothers. 
[03:33:30]  I like them when they're asleep.  I can back them.  They never know it.  CBS.  It never ends.  Artie, you're next on WNW, actually.  How you doing, guys?  All right.  WNW, Artie, you're on.  I hated those guys when I used to listen to them as a kid. 
[03:34:00]  This is the funniest skit I have ever heard in my whole life.  We're going to get jobs over there at CBS FM.  You guys are much better than those clowns that used to be over there, I'll tell you.  Hey, Bloody Anus here on CBS.  And I want to remind everybody at the Namla Convention this weekend, don't forget, tight  little supple buttocks, sponsored by us here at CBS FM.  Nine-year-old boys, not a hair on their sack.  What's up, Gio?  How you guys doing? 
[03:34:30]  Good.  What's up?  Make it fast.  Yeah, listen.  I want to hear some Beach Boys.  Can you hook me up with some Beach Boys, please?  Yeah, let's find some Beach Boys for us now.  Can Harry Sack hook me up with some Beach Boys, please?  Harry Sack, Gio will hook you up with some Beach Boys.  All right, Harry.  Thanks, man.  We'll get to Gio's request in a second, but here's another one for everyone out there in  Radio Live.  Hey, everybody.  Claude Balls here.  Frankie Avalon from 1959.  Venus rhymes with penis.  What I like having in my face. 
[03:35:00]  CBS.  CBS.  Penis, if you will.  Please send a little girl for me to prison.  Yeah, I like the line of that song.  My kisses in my arms.  Everyone from 1958, the teddy bears, to know him is to love him, and to know me is to be  bleeding from the ass when you wake up.  CBS.  Love, love, love, love me. 
[03:35:30]  Just to see.  Well, now we're getting the request coming in here.  That was great.  Andrew, what would you like to hear this afternoon?  Listen, Bloody Anus, could you play a little Three Dog Night for me?  Andrew wants to hear some Three Dog Night.  I remember I had a Three Dog Night once.  One on my face.  Another one I was banging.  And the other one was licking me.  You know where.  See me on.  Yeah, this one came. 
[03:36:00]  Baby Cortez.  It's called the happy organ, this song.  I have a happy organ in my pants.  Just thinking.  Oh, there it goes all over the console.  CBS.  Just had an accident.  Jesus Christ.  Hey, big dick goes in you here. 
[03:36:30]  It's the Crass 16 Candle.  I love you so much.  Suck me, CBS.  This ever ends.  Hey, Frank.  Guys, seriously, come on.  It's not funny anymore.  Maybe for the first five seconds it was funny.  No, we just drilled into the ground, dude. 
[03:37:00]  Listen to me off.  We just wanted to see how long it would take someone to call up and say, knock it off.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, Frank.  And for you.  Can I have a request?  Yeah.  This one's going out to you, Frank.  Okay.  For silhouettes, get a job, you loser, Frank.  Frank's a child toucher, CBS.  It's not funny.  It's not funny, man.  Frank says it's not funny.  It's not funny.  It's pissing him off.  CBS.  He's laughing. 
[03:37:30]  CBS.  Oh, boy.  Frank's a homo.  CBS.  Come on.  We're just having fun.  I know.  I think Rick just can't make it stop.  One more.  Make it stop.  Make it stop.  We got to end up on an up note here.  All right.  Here we go.  Claude Ball's here.  This one's going back to 1961. 
[03:38:00]  Well, the lion sleeps tonight.  The tokens.  Lion wouldn't be sleeping if I were there.  I'm into bestiality.  I'll bag anything with a hole.  CBS FM.  Oh, brother.  So there you have it.  CBS FM.  They make fun of us with one lousy line, and we just did about an hour on them. 
[03:38:30]  Thank you for giving us an hour of material.  That doesn't sound so bad.  That sucks, man, from wall to wall.  107 WNEW. </pre>
