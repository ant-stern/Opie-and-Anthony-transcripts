<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with humorous commentary on a Seattle earthquake, featuring video of news reporters and Bill Gates' reactions.  The conversation then veers into absurd hypotheticals about California drifting into the ocean, prompting listener calls suggesting ridiculous solutions.  A caller, claiming to be former President Bill Clinton, engages in self-deprecating humor about his post-presidency life, offering the show beer and "hookers," and expressing interest in judging a boob contest.  Dr. Ruth Westheimer then makes a surprise in-studio appearance, leading to a sexually suggestive conversation about her new book, "Rekindling Romance for Dummies," and ending abruptly after the hosts suggest "Anal for Dummies" as her next title.  The show shifts to Jesse Jackson's paternity scandal, with the hosts and callers using crude humor and racial slurs to discuss the situation.  Frequent caller Earl expresses his disappointment.

The next segment opens with further discussion of the Jesse Jackson scandal, comparing it to Bill Clinton's past controversies and referencing the Drudge Report.  A caller, Jackie, describes a sexual fetish involving knives, leading to an explicit conversation with Jackie, her roommate, and the hosts, culminating in plans for the roommate to become a guest.  Other topics include rumors of a WNEW radio lineup change, a conspiracy theory about glow-in-the-dark monkeys, and darkly humorous speculation about O.J. Simpson's possible involvement in a break-in at his ex-girlfriend's home.  A listener wins backstage passes to a Rick Springfield concert.

The following segment focuses on a Rick Springfield contest.  Contestant Antoinette, demonstrating extensive knowledge of Springfield's life, answers increasingly explicit questions before a phone connection issue ends her participation.  Mike ultimately wins backstage passes, dinner with Springfield's family, front-row tickets, and a signed guitar.  The segment concludes with the hosts playing a song by the Olsen twins, filled with sexually suggestive lyrics and bizarre, repeated phrases like "critters on my crackers," "big shoes on my egg," and "sacred salmon elephant."

The final segment discussed features the hosts mocking a song with nonsensical phrases ("critters on my crackers," etc.), using crude and sexually explicit language, and insults like "filthy whore."  The segment ends with a commercial break and a station identifier.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  You want a little dose of honesty? You'll find it here, on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  You're a couple of idiots! Filthy, disgusting, breezy idiots!  1027 WNEW  It's Friday! Friday! Friday! 
[00:00:30]  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  212-757-1027, Anthony.  Yes.  Huge earthquake in Seattle.  Huge.  Oh, yes.  Breaking news, welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Seattle rocked by a 7.0 magnitude earthquake.  And that's about it.  They were showing some footage on TV? 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  The best was, they have video of some news conference, right?  They were getting ready for a news conference out there?  It was a press conference, Bill Gates, head of Microsoft, was giving a speech.  Was that, wasn't it two separate things?  Yeah, they had a couple of different things.  I'm talking about the one where there was a bunch of people in one room, waiting for someone  to speak, to have them on camera, and all of a sudden the guy just starts freaking out  because the earthquake is happening.  It's pretty cool because what you saw was, and they'll probably show this a thousand times  on the news, you see people just going about their business, setting up their cameras, 
[00:01:30]  setting up the mics, and then you notice, like, it's shaking a little.  But no one really took note, because they just kind of started looking around like in  the what, what is that kind of thing?  What the F.  But then it just goes, whew, and starts shaking, and one reporter goes, damn it, and holds  on to a piece of the wall, and the camera's right on him, and he has the most scared,  S-less look on his face.  Not that you can blame him.  And then it stops shaking, and it was hilarious. 
[00:02:00]  Everyone ran to the window.  Yeah, yeah, and Opie made a little observation.  I'm like, you can't see an earthquake.  Why are you running to the window?  I ran to the window.  Hey, there it is.  There it goes.  Someone catch it.  It's an earthquake.  Hey, there it goes.  You see it?  It's just kind of fading away over the hills there.  Bill Gates blew it, though.  Did you see his press conference?  They had a camera on the stage, big stage.  You know, one of the big, not to interrupt, but this is a second piece of video they got  where they're in a huge auditorium. 
[00:02:30]  Big auditorium.  Bill Gates on stage, ready to give a speech, like he always does.  Head of Microsoft.  And he blew a good chance there.  A huge opportunity.  Because it starts really shaking.  Lights are falling on top of the audience, off of the stage.  Things, you can see the lights kind of popping as they hit the stage.  And the audience is getting up panicked and trying to run to the exits.  Pretty awesome scene.  Yeah, it was cool.  Bill Gates missed his opportunity to just stand up, open his arms to the crowd, and go,  Behold the power of Microsoft! 
[00:03:00]  How dare you try to divvy up my company!  Fear me!  Fear me!  I am Bill Gates.  I make the earth shake with Microsoft.  He missed his opportunity.  That's true.  You know what?  You know when people would have turned around and gone,  Holy yes, we better listen to this guy.  Anyway, Anthony, the earthquake was a 7.0. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, that's a biggie.  I got a friend who does a talk show, same time we're on.  We're trying to get a hold of him, but he can't call Seattle right now for some reason.  I guess a lot of the phone lines might be down or busy.  Yeah.  A lot of busy signals when you have an earthquake.  It was no, from the damage I was watching on the news, it was no San Francisco earthquake.  No, there was no, you know, the highway just collapsed and pancaked 250 cars.  Nothing like that. 
[00:04:00]  Nothing like that.  Just a few bricks falling.  I saw a lot of walls down on top of some cars.  There was a fire on a roof.  Yeah.  Firemen went up with fire extinguishers.  Didn't even need the hoses or anything.  We should get Earl on the radio today.  Earl is like, oh, God, we're talking about earthquakes and stuff,  and Earl goes, you know, they say that, you know,  a piece of California is going to just kind of break away and float.  Float away.  Drift off into the ocean.  Drift off.  Earl, do you know anything about the earth? 
[00:04:30]  It's not like we're just on these floating pieces of dirt on the water.  I'm sure it's going to drift away eventually,  but when they mean drift away, they mean it's going to take about, I don't know, 278,000 years.  Perhaps even millions of years.  Yeah, exactly.  Where the plates move.  But Earl's logic, it's like all of a sudden, you know, we're part of California.  Next thing you know, we're just kind of drifting away.  Drifting off.  You get up for work that morning. 
[00:05:00]  You're driving.  All of a sudden, the road ends.  You go, hey, how am I going to get to work?  There's an ocean here.  All of a sudden, my commute was twice as long,  and there was a lot of water in between me and work.  I didn't know what to do, so I just went home and went back to sleep.  Right.  Didn't that happen today?  Because that's exactly what I did.  This drifting away crap continues to happen all around us.  Things are drifting away all the time.  What do you want on this fault line?  Anthony brings up a good point.  Like, Long Island, it's a safe bet that it was attached to Manhattan.  Yeah, at some point, it was all dirt. 
[00:05:30]  But it's kind of drifting away.  Now, you know, what do we do?  Did we freak out?  No, you build a bridge.  You just build a bridge.  It's not like we're cavemen, and it starts drifting away,  and there's nothing we can do about it.  You know, at one point, there was just glacier covering this,  and people moved on.  Right.  They took their loincloths, their families,  and their little obsidian spears, and went south.  Earl, so what do you hear?  California's going to drift away?  No.  It's the white man's fault, isn't it, Earl?  No.  Oh.  You blame it on the spice of it. 
[00:06:00]  All I said was that...  Hey, let's play Dobie Gray, drift away, for Earl.  What do you say?  Like old times.  What are you trying to say?  No, I said, isn't it...  At one point, there's going to be an earthquake that will completely destroy the West Coast,  or most of it.  I'm absolutely right.  I am absolutely right.  It's Earl for the future.  You laugh at me now, but you wait 30 years from now.  You're going to see what happens in California.  The entire West Coast will be destroyed by the West Coast.  I didn't say, like, tomorrow. 
[00:06:30]  I mean, like...  When?  You know, it could be a million years from now.  I don't know.  I heard Black Air for the future, a million years from now.  Oh, my God, we're still oppressed.  There's no observations.  It's an observation that it's just going to, if I could say, drift away.  Do you watch the Discovery Channel at all, or else no?  Do you watch anything about the mechanics of our fine planet Earth?  I know how it works. 
[00:07:00]  I know how that works.  It doesn't just crumble and fall off.  It's just a figure of speech.  The Earth is a constantly changing thing.  I understand.  It's always moving and changing.  If you look at the geography of this planet from millions of years ago,  you wouldn't even recognize the countries and continents. 
[00:07:30]  And just because we're here doesn't mean it stops.  It's a slow-moving thing.  At one point, your home of Africa was butted right up against South America.  I know that.  And Florida was part of it.  And then it moves, Earl.  It didn't happen overnight.  I didn't say it would happen overnight.  Earl, is the whole California West Coast thing going to, like, drift away like one of those balls,  like when the kid is playing in the shallow end and the ball just kind of drifts away into the deep end? 
[00:08:00]  Deep end and there's nothing he can do about it.  The kid's screwed.  You try to get, like, do an oar thing in the water.  Like, that's going to help.  Yeah.  I'm not touching the ball, but I'm making the water come toward me.  Maybe we can get all those Mexicans at the same time and do that thing with the water to bring it back.  That's all we need.  Bring it back around.  The Earth's changing.  It happens over a long time.  It's basically Mother Nature just, like, scratching her balloon knot.  Right.  She had a little itch. 
[00:08:30]  That's what it is.  It's a little, it's so insignificant if you look at it on a planetary scale.  But us people, we're so self-important, the human race, so self-important, it's like a big deal.  And they try to predict all these things.  It ain't going to happen.  We're just another organism temporarily on this planet until whatever powers may be decide they've had enough.  Errol, you think we could, like, tie a big rope to the West Coast so it doesn't drift away? 
[00:09:00]  No.  How about that?  What do you think?  Big rope?  We got the Mexicans for it.  Right.  You ever see when they get a bunch of Mexicans on the landscaping truck and they're holding each other and they're on top of the grass clippings to hold it down?  Why don't we just do that?  We'll have them over the fault line like this big, giant Mexican net.  They could hold a cactus on one side, a bush on the other.  I'm here.  This is helping. 
[00:09:30]  And it's okay because they give me benefits.  Yeah.  Rod, what's going on?  Oh, man.  You guys are killing me, man.  I used to live out in Los Angeles.  And then when you're talking about people running through the windows, I experienced an earthquake.  It's called a wave earthquake where the ground does, like, a water wave.  Yeah.  I mean, the houses and everything are doing it.  And I woke up and I'm like, oh, shh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  And I run through the window and I look down and I'm like, wait a minute, where am I going?  The Earth's dead movie.  What am I going to go out the window for? 
[00:10:00]  He just brought that back and it just made me laugh.  And then he's talking about the Mother Nature stretched her balloon.  Her balloon knot, that's it, you know.  Stretching her balloon knot.  You ever get an itch?  You know, you get an itch, you got to dig a little.  Get in it.  Get in it.  Get in it.  You get in it.  All right, Ron.  That's the same thing.  If I may transfer the magnitude into something you can understand.  It's a 7.0.  That is exactly a 12.1 nigger watts of energy. 
[00:10:30]  Manny, what's going on?  Cohen A, what's happening, guys?  All right.  I want to ask her a couple questions.  First, does he know if California breaks off, we've got union workers that can weld that  back together?  Yeah, we've got wonders with steel these days.  Second of all, is New York going to become like escaping New York in a movie?  Oh, man.  You know, but Earl was just, he was just talking about how it's just going to drift away.  And we're not going to...  It's like Hawaii did.  I heard Hawaii connected. 
[00:11:00]  Well, there you go.  Then we're going to have to take a flight to, you know, to see the shoreline.  All right, guys.  You guys suck.  All right, buddy.  See you.  Charles has something good here.  Charles, what's up?  Charles.  Charles.  Hey.  Charles.  Charles.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  He wanted to know, Earl, if the part that breaks away from California, if we could call  it Wilson. 
[00:11:30]  Rename that part of the country Wilson.  A little castaway reference.  See, Charles, that was brilliant.  Where were you?  Very good.  I'll take your line.  Yeah, we are very self-absorbed, self-important.  James Planet will do whatever it pleases with us.  Like, people always bitching that we're destroying the planet, save the Earth and stuff.  I think, I think, um, who did a bit on that?  George Carlin was doing something on this.  And he's so right about it. 
[00:12:00]  You know, there's no saving the Earth.  It doesn't matter how much garbage you throw out of something.  Yeah, temporarily it does some damage.  But in the long haul, over a million or so years, that little plastic six-ring, six-pack  thing that you get your cans of soda in, ain't even going to matter.  This planet's had life on it for quite a while, and it always goes away, and something else  takes its place.  So I wouldn't worry about it.  James, what's going on?  What's going on, fellas? 
[00:12:30]  Hey.  Listen, does Earl know that the, uh, that the moon is moving closer to the Earth about an  inch every year?  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  What now, Earl?  Earl, what do we do to prepare?  Buck Rogers rocket packs on the moon.  That's what we do in, uh, 50 years from now.  And we're fired on what they call the retro rockets.  All right, James.  Thank you.  Uh, actually, Long Island was a glacier deposit.  All right.  That's how it was formed.  It was the end of a glacier that came from up north.  It pushed all the way down.  That's where it ended.  And that's what Long Island is, all the garbage. 
[00:13:00]  It was that last piece of poo.  That's it.  Earl, just think.  You know, I was saying, uh, millions and millions of years ago, Africa was butted right  up against, uh, America.  Imagine the boat trip it would have saved if it still would have been like that.  Right?  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Uh, I think Earl's right.  He's talking about the San Andreas fault.  Well, we know what he's saying, but he made it sound like it's just going to start drifting  away one day.  No, that's going to take, like, millions of years.  Well, that's the point we're making. 
[00:13:30]  I'm sorry.  I'm supposed to tell her into the conversation, man.  Earl pretty much made it sound in the back office.  He's trying to correct himself now.  Like, it's going to be like the little volleyball in Castaway just drifting away.  And for a little while, you're going to think, I think I might be able to save this part  of the country.  If I jump in now, I think I can pull it back.  Just push.  All right, Joe.  What if we just get all the pleasure craft that are out there to push on the beach with  their engines full revved, everything from jet skis to big ships, and just push it 
[00:14:00]  back into place?  Earl, comment.  Erica, what's up?  It's to you, Earl.  Hey, guys.  Yeah, you're bringing up a tragic childhood memory of mine.  Yeah?  Yeah, I remember my best friend used to live next door to me, but then Europe floated away.  Europe floated away.  Bye, guys.  Isn't that terrible?  Carrying on a nice conversation with some English chap, and all of a sudden, there's thousands 
[00:14:30]  of miles of ocean in between you.  What happened?  I just saw him yesterday.  And why can't Mexico just float away?  Boy, that stuck as attached, huh?  Yeah.  There's some steel workers that did a good job there, huh?  It's like America's colon hanging right off the bottom.  Right.  A little Rio Grande river there, and it doesn't even help.  All the parts you don't want to drift away, drift away.  The ones you want, stay attached.  We need California. 
[00:15:00]  Kind of cool.  But Mexico?  All right.  Well, we should take our first break.  All right.  Here's the breaking news of Seattle.  Huge earthquake, 7.0.  Breaking news.  Now.  On the old Richter scale E.  And yeah, that's true.  Opak has a comment here.  Superman was able to save California, if you remember.  All he had to do was fly around the earth real fast in the opposite direction. 
[00:15:30]  And time went backwards, and he stopped Lex Luthor's missiles from going into the San Andreas Fault.  See?  So it can be done.  Earl, comment.  He's giving you that dirty look.  I love the Earl.  You know that.  Come on.  Hold on.  Uncle Remus is online, too.  Mr. Remus?  Yes.  Hello there.  Hey.  Hello there, boys.  Listen, I have a hold-out back, and I'm doing some work. 
[00:16:00]  I wanted to know if Earl would like to help me dig to China.  Dig to China?  Dig to China.  Straight through the earth.  I'm on the other side in Chinatown.  What do you think, Earl?  Earl, get on the mic.  Now, if we dig to China, if we dig to China, are we going to fall out of the hole?  What will happen?  All right.  You pass the midway point through the middle of the earth.  Now, you're digging and climbing.  How is that possible?  Are you really climbing, or are you still digging, and you fall out of the hole?  Opie, I don't think we can answer that. 
[00:16:30]  Earl?  Comment.  We dig all the way through the center of the earth.  If I can revert to journey to the center of the earth, I believe they went there, and there were troll people living there.  Well, Anthony, Glenn wants to revert to Bugs Bunny.  Yes, Glenn?  Yeah, when Bugs Bunny got pissed off, and he used a hand saw, and he sawed Florida up, and it floated away.  Yes, I remember that.  Okay, so there.  Now we've got some evidence that it's possible.  All right, so you just revert to Bugs Bunny, and you're good.  Earl, your view. 
[00:17:00]  Yes, yes.  Earl, to you.  Yes.  Julio.  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  I've got a question for you.  Yeah.  If California starts drifting away, are the long-distance charges going to be cheaper if you call Europe?  As they get more expensive for the United States, they will get cheaper, actually, for Asia.  For Asia, right.  Right, okay.  That makes sense.  You've got to know your geography.  Now it makes perfect sense. 
[00:17:30]  You got it.  Thank you.  All right, thank you.  Earl?  Earl, to you.  Please, Earl, comment.  Earl?  If you will.  Earl?  If you will.  We are buying up that beachfront property.  We have this way about us that makes people just start mumbling for themselves.  I don't get it.  Oh, I don't have the energy to fight anymore.  I'm going to go back and do it. 
[00:18:00]  Call record labels and get a trip.  I've had it.  I thought the guys could give away eventually.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Owen?  How you doing today?  What are you giving away all the good ideas for?  You're going to have all the Cubans want to paddle their whole country this way.  Never mind coming by boat.  You know, now the cat's out of the bed.  Cuba is relatively small compared to a lot of other land masses.  Right, Earl? 
[00:18:30]  Well, now, couldn't they, in fact, just paddle their whole country right over to Florida?  Doc, right into Miami.  Since we're all just floating in the ocean.  You know?  That would make sense.  One outboard engine.  It might take a while to build up some speed, but once you get a whole country moving, there's  no stopping it.  You've got to know that.  Oh, God.  Neil, what's up?  I just want to ask Earl if the moon really is made out of cheese. 
[00:19:00]  Earl, cheese to you.  And can the rocket actually crash into the eye?  Hey, that's a good reference, man.  Interesting.  Very good.  All right.  I'll check back on that.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Earl?  Wow.  Thank you, Earl, for getting on.  Un-effing believable.  Getting our first break together today.  Fantastic.  All right, we've got to take a quick break.  We'll be back.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  O.P. and Anthony. 
[00:19:30]  We punish ignorance.  Hey, Ash, turn down your radio.  1-0-2-7-WNEW.  Hey, Anthony.  WrestleMania is coming Sunday on Pay-Per-View.  Could be the biggest one ever, I'm thinking.  It's live from Houston.  Yeah.  In the Asperdome.  65,000 fans will be there.  Be loud.  The Rock.  Stone Cold Steve Austin for the championship.  And, of course, this I'm looking forward to.  Vince McMahon and the new WCW owner Shane McMahon in a street fight. 
[00:20:00]  That's great.  Whenever these two go at it, you know, they're show-offs.  So there'll be some, I think, some high-flying.  I think we're going to see Shane do some high-flying again.  And a sledgehammer to the skull by Triple H left.  16 staples in The Undertaker's forehead.  Now The Undertaker looking for revenge.  So you've got Triple H against The Undertaker.  The Dudleys, the Hardy Boys, and Edge and Christian shocked the world on the most electrifying tag team. 
[00:20:30]  Tables, ladders, and chairs match ever.  Seeing this time, we guarantee the sequel to be better than the original with tables, ladders, and chairs to WWF WrestleMania 17.  Live and only on Cablevision Pay-Per-View this Sunday, 8 p.m.  Call your local pay-per-view representative to order now.  O.B. and Anthony.  The Sixer O-R-N-Y.  Out of country.  1-8-7-W-N-E-W.  I was told to go right to the phone, 2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7. 
[00:21:00]  You never know who's going to say hi on this radio show.  Mr. Clinton.  Hello, sir.  Mr. Clinton.  Hello.  Oh, there you are.  What's up?  Hi.  How are y'all doing today?  Pretty good.  We want to know why you're calling our radio show.  Well, I'm out of office now, and I just thought it might be nice to hook up with a cool, hip radio show. 
[00:21:30]  Man, you must be bored.  Bored?  God damn, I'm bored shitless.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait, wait, you can't say that.  Wait, what happened?  You're bored-estless is what you want to say, right?  Well, that's what I meant.  I'm sitting around now, I'm just kind of scratching, watching cartoons.  Goddamn. Last week I had my finger on the button. Today, look, I got my finger on my nuts. I'm stretching, I'm burping, I got nothing to do. It's hard because no one wants to accept me as just a man. I'm still the president, but hey, I like your boob contest. Hey, by the way, could I come down and be a judge? 
[00:22:00]  You want to be a judge for the boob contest? Well, we're not looking for judges, sir. Oh, I just want to know if I could be a friend of the show. I got a gumball machine that I'd like to bring down for you. And do you have an annoying laugh? I just want to be a friend of the show. 
[00:22:30]  Hey, sir. And is there any way, like, I'll bring down beer and stuff and, you know, I have some of my own hookers and whatnot. Well, we'd like beer. I mean, you can come by anytime with me. Sure, I could bring plenty of beer. I just want to be a friend of the show. Can I hang out in your office after the show? No, you can't. Maybe just come down. Could you get me into Caroline's to see Norton? No, no, you can't. No, no, no, no, sir, sir. I could get you a limo. 1-800-GO-VITALS. Please, I just... 
[00:23:00]  Man, your life is pathetic, aren't you? Well, I got nothing to do. It's, you know, kind of hard these days.  You look kind of sad in the paper today. I mean, I guess yesterday you went to a deli to get an egg sandwich.  Ooh, big day. God damn, I'm getting an egg sandwich. You know, I was brokering peace in the Mideast, and I'm keeping averting wars and whatnot.  God, now, ooh, you know, I asked for cheese on this. Hey, what did you do? I didn't want ketchup. I don't like ketchup on my fried egg. 
[00:23:30]  That's the kind of big drama that I'm doing now in my life.  Some of the new decisions you have to make, I guess.  Some of the new, very important decisions I got to make. Ooh, you know, should I wear the socks with the red and blue stripe on top, or just the white ones?  Hey, I heard you were having a discussion about High Noon with the guy working behind the counter yesterday.  Yeah. Damn, shoot me. I can't take this anymore. I've my whole life worked up to being president. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  And then now that I'm not president no more, and I got that twat wife of mine of more power than I have, you know, what am I going to do? Talk about movies.  Hey, did you see Snatch?  Uh, no, but I heard it was pretty good.  Snatch is always good.  Yeah. And that movie, too, should be pretty good.  Okay, that old gag.  Hey, how about those, uh, the Bush girls?  Uh, you like the Bush girls?  That was nice when her, uh, when her, uh, booby popped out there. 
[00:24:30]  You see the breast meat popping out?  God damn, I'd like to get her in the Oval Office.  Yeah, well.  I'm not going to be there again.  I know.  This is sad.  It really is sad.  This is so sad.  God damn, that Ackerman's a hack, isn't he?  He really is. He's got to work on his material.  He's a whore.  So I'm going to be right across the street from you boys now.  Yeah.  I'm going to be, uh, over at Carnegie Hall.  Yeah, they got some horses.  What I would like to ask you boys is when you do Teen Week, just include your ex-president. 
[00:25:00]  I think you're going to...  Have me come down.  Yeah.  And, uh, you're going to have some fun.  You know, I could, I got the pimp hand.  I could work it on a lesbian couch.  I'll tell you that.  I think we can work you into the schedule there, sir.  I got a big fat intern to suck my...  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  You don't have any beef with, uh, Andrew D. Clay, do you?  Oh, God damn, that guy's ripped off more things than I've said.  No.  I used to say all the time, hey, look, I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  And he stole that. 
[00:25:30]  He stole everything from you, huh?  Yeah, that was my line.  How about the boogaloo-galoo?  Boogaloo-galoo was me.  They all know when we were in Air Force One, I'd get the whole press corps just going, boogaloo-galoo,  boogaloo-galoo, I'm over here now.  It was great.  And he just ripped me off and I can't take it.  Oh, how sad.  Well, when does the wife leave for Washington?  Not soon enough.  Oh, huh?  Jesus Christ, old thunder thighs.  I can't wait until she's out of here because let me tell you something.  Yeah.  I got friends, girlfriends, guys, some pot and stuff. 
[00:26:00]  They're just waiting outside to watch her car pull away.  And they're all going to pull up like an old party.  Kind of like when the parents used to leave town, huh?  Exactly.  Keg party.  That's what it's like.  Yeah, keg stands, funnel shots, jello shots, belly shots.  Also, I'm auditioning for Temptation Island.  You are, huh?  I'm going to go there with Hillary.  Yeah.  And see if I can't be tempted.  I'll be knee deep and skank hose within five minutes. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, it looks like you have a full schedule, sir.  Well, right when she leaves, I'm going to just get my underwear and socks and sunglasses.  Yeah, yeah.  And I'm going to dance around.  Yeah.  Let's take those old records off the shelf.  I'll be party time, let me tell you.  Hey, did you have one of those cable modems, huh?  You know, sales was supposed to get me there for free before I left the White House, and  I'm waiting and waiting.  You're still waiting, too, huh?  I'm such a cheap son of a bitch.  I won't even dig into my own pocket to get a cable modem.  You better be talking about yourself, sir. 
[00:27:00]  That's what I'm talking about, me.  Okay.  God damn, I am the cheapest mother ever on the face of the earth.  They've been offering me this free cable modem, and I'm just like, God damn, it's supposed  to be free.  And it's only $99, and you get the first 30 days free.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What a cheap son of a bitch I am.  That's you, right?  I got what they call the T-Rex arm.  That's you, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah, sure, me.  Yeah.  You bastard.  Got any fat chicks coming up? 
[00:27:30]  No.  I got a soft spot for fat chicks.  We have, uh...  You just grip those ears and pull it in.  You don't know where the cans end and the belly begins.  Oh!  We have the XFL cheerleaders coming up.  Bill Dice Clinton.  XFL cheerleaders, sir.  So, ah, this chick is sucking mine.  You know.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, right.  And, uh, she looks all embarrassed.  Yeah.  And so did everyone else on the elevator.  Oh!  I could sell out the garden. 
[00:28:00]  Oh!  You should start with the Beacon, sir.  Yeah, I'll do one show at the Beacon.  All right.  And then at Rascals, the real one, not the fake one.  So, ah, so you want to just, ah, hang out, huh?  Yeah, I just want to come down.  Right.  Maybe hang out.  Right.  Have a few beers, some whores.  Right.  You know, back like, ah, in the White House.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to let you go.  Hang up the phone, you skank.  That was me.  That was Rippo.  If you come by during Teen Week, ah, you can sit at Opie's desk.  Yeah, well, can I sit at the big desk? 
[00:28:30]  Easy.  I want to sit at Opie's desk in the office because I hear it's bigger than the one I had at the  White House.  Easy, sir.  Hang up the phone, you skank.  All right.  That's me yelling at Hillary.  All right.  We're going to let you go.  Thank you, boys.  All right.  There you go.  The president of the United States of America, former president Clinton.  Very bored up there in Chappaqua.  We found a girl that could shoot stuff from a private area. 
[00:29:00]  More stupidity on the way.  1027 WNEW.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You will never see a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.  1027.  WNEW.  NEW.  Holy S, Dr. Ruth Westheimer is walking down the hall. 
[00:29:30]  She's two and a half feet tall.  Yeah, she's a little fidget.  Tell her to wait outside.  She's trying to run right in here.  Hold on a minute.  Dr. Ruth, there she is.  Look how cute.  All right, hold on, hold on.  We'll get what?  What do you want to say, Dr. Ruth?  How are you, Dr. Ruth?  Dr. Ruth, and a website, of course.  Everyone needs a website.  Get Dr. Ruth her cam.  Dr. Ruth, you don't age.  Look at her trying to get on the chair.  Is that adorable?  I'm going skiing.  Yeah, we're on. 
[00:30:00]  We're on.  All right.  Look at it, it's Dr. Ruth.  I have to tell you.  Yeah.  I have to tell you, Peter.  All of you out there who are listening to these two rather good-looking guys.  Thank you, Dr. Ruth.  I want to say you're quite the hottie yourself.  I want them, and that was before they said that I look good.  Yeah.  I want them that if they are not very respectful, and if they don't treat me nice, I know where 
[00:30:30]  the door is.  And she will walk.  Very fast.  I'm a fast walker, but I have to tell you something.  We're a huge fan of yours.  Don't you understand that?  Yeah.  I was in high school.  I used to listen to your radio show.  It was the best.  Did you learn something?  Yeah.  We used to double-day drive around listening to Dr. Ruth, hoping to get some.  Yeah.  I swear to God.  It's a good way to break the ice.  Yeah.  You know, you listen to Dr. Ruth, and then we go, hey, look at what Dr. Ruth is saying.  Why don't we check that out?  I really did that program.  I did it with pleasure for almost nine and a half years. 
[00:31:00]  Right.  Every Sunday night, plenty of people did get pleasure out of that program.  Oh, I bet.  And I love doing it.  And I want to tell you something.  Yeah.  On a serious note.  Uh-oh.  Oh, she's pointing at us.  You see?  Uh-oh.  You see?  Then I'll talk about this book, but I want to tell you something on a serious note.  Okay.  Because of people like you and me and others.  Sounds like the meeting we were at the other day.  It started the same way.  Because people have taken that subject matter a little bit more seriously, the rate of unintended 
[00:31:30]  pregnancies has been reduced.  Why do you think that is, though?  Because of people like you on radio.  Really?  People like myself.  People all over.  Well, how does that work?  I think I know it.  I'm talking about contraceptives.  Because we're, yeah, we're, okay, yeah, sure.  Remember she used to talk about contraception on her show all the time?  Dr. Ruth, I...  Now, I have to tell you something.  I hate contraception.  First of all, you have...  Don't even say that because you're going to be in trouble with me. 
[00:32:00]  First of all, you have to plug my website.  Oh, website.  www.drruth.com on AOL.  Right.  Can you say that both?  DrRuth.com.  Right.  You don't need the www.  You have to kind of know that by now.  Yeah, you just say drruth.com.  I like that.  Yeah, okay.  Now, you are the very first ones in the history of this world.  That book is hot off the press.  Can you read it from over there? 
[00:32:30]  Rekindling Romance for Dummies.  For Dummies.  Now, you have a for dummies book.  There's a lot of for dummies books out there about, like, auto mechanics or how to fly a plane for dummies.  But now you've got rekindling romance.  I already had one that's called Sex for Dummies.  What about...  Oh, you did.  ...out in a new edition with interesting information.  Don't you say you don't like contraceptives.  Some people have to use it.  I understand, Dr. Ruth, but let me tell you something.  Sex for Dummies.  It never feels as good.  I'll talk to you later.  No, I just...  I've got to be honest with you.  Like, some forms of contraception are fine. 
[00:33:00]  But that whole condom thing...  Oh, God.  That's awful.  You people, it's not enough to be sexually literate.  You also have to know how to bring home flowers.  Are you going to bring home flowers tonight?  Tonight, no.  Why?  Probably not tonight, no.  Then I hope that those partners...  I might be bringing home a rash or something, but...  Then I hope those partners of yours say goodbye.  So, what I did in this book...  She's wishing our partners said goodbye.  Right.  Dr. Ruth, you want a bestseller? 
[00:33:30]  Do you bring flowers?  Is that going to be a bestseller?  Of course.  Because I got the title for your next book, I'm thinking.  No, first...  Anal for Dummies.  Oh.  Are you...  She's going to walk out.  Don't do that.  No, I'm not...  It's part of the sex, right?  But guess what?  Yeah, sorry.  I'm a good psychologist.  When I walked in here, I gave one look to the two of you.  And guess what?  I knew who would ask something or who would say something... 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, see, you're right.  Goodbye, guys.  He's the smartass.  It's like my book.  Right.  Rekindling Romance for Dummies by Dr. Ruth.  DrRuth.com.  Wait, do you think I was...  And it's with Pierre Lehou, my co-authent.  Right.  Am I the wise guy, though?  I'm not saying anything about you.  He is.  Okay.  He is, Dr. Ruth.  You hit it on the head.  This is with Pierre Lehou.  I've now worked with him for 20 years.  How long have you been working together?  Um, my God.  It's got to be six years.  Six years, I think.  Sure.  Yeah, that's it.  Six and a half, maybe.  How come there's not one woman here?  Um...  Because we... 
[00:34:30]  I don't know.  It's kind of like...  It's like a men's locker room in here.  How come?  I see outside men.  There are women sometimes, though.  No, I didn't see one.  Not on the staff, but we bring in a lot of girls and stuff.  Dr. Ruth, the women that come in here are looked at as sex objects for our show.  Yeah.  That's terrible.  Isn't it?  I'm being honest, though.  Yeah, but I don't...  Want us to lie?  I sometimes do want people to lie.  Oh.  Dr. Ruth, what can we get out of this book now?  Tell us what we can get if we pick up Rekindling Rummen.  If you pick up today, I promise you, you are going to have the most fantastic sexual relationship 
[00:35:00]  with your partner.  Yeah, nice.  If you add some romantic tips here.  Like flowers.  Is this flowers, a little dinner every once in a while, right?  Tell her that you love her.  Now, this is Rekindling.  Does this mean if you're in a relationship, maybe that's gone a little sour?  A little boring.  The passion is gone.  A little boring.  Yeah.  You use the same position all the time.  And I'm telling you that if you Rekindle it, it's like starting a new relationship. 
[00:35:30]  You have a relationship on a fertile ground because you already have the relationship.  Right.  So then you really build on that and it's going to be fabulous.  So what's an example that we can look for in here?  Something good, romantic that could help Rekindle a relationship?  The most important thing is to take time.  Time.  Even so, you work many hours.  Be a good listener, right?  And be a good listener.  And take time and walk outside in the snow. 
[00:36:00]  Sure.  What?  What does that have to do with Rekindling?  That's very...  Like a little hand-in-hand walk down the street in the snow.  She's talking about romance, Anthony.  I can't believe that you would know things like this.  Dr. Ruth, I've got to tell you something.  I'm very romantic.  They warned me.  They warned me about you.  They said it's a horny show.  You're wonderful.  Thank you very much.  Goodbye.  I love being romantic.  We have a sensitive side, Dr. Ruth.  Yes.  Look at him.  Romance is great.  Even his eyes sparkle.  So, a fireplace. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  That's great.  And I'm dressing slowly.  How about nice little cards for no reason?  Would be wonderful.  See?  Isn't that nice?  Some chocolate.  Yeah.  You know what would be nice?  What?  If you made dinner tonight.  Ah.  I made...  Let me tell you something.  I'll be honest with you.  I made dinner last night.  And did it work?  I made dinner last night.  Did you tell her you love her?  Of course.  It was fish sticks and tater tots.  I put it on the foil.  I set the timer for 12 minutes.  And it was a good dinner. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  And I even got the ketchup and everything.  I forgot to bring it to the table.  Thank you, guys.  Dr. Ruth is someone...  Wait a minute.  She's bailing out before it gets done.  She's nervous.  Dr. Ruth.  I thought you'd take a few...  I thought you'd take a few phone calls, maybe.  Like the old days.  I really have to run.  And I did it because I was in the building.  Yeah.  And you're actually very nice, guys.  Thank you, Dr. Ruth.  I can do it again with the next book.  Yeah.  Rick, set up something with maybe a publicist so we can have a little more time with her.  We'll take some calls.  Because our listeners are just as nice as we are.  Okay. 
[00:37:30]  Bye.  Dr. Ruth, thank you very much.  There she goes.  Her book, Rekindling Romance for Dummies.  Go to drruth.com.  On AOL.  On AOL.  Well, they could get to it, I'm sure.  Yeah, okay.  Dr. Ruth, thank you.  There she goes.  Dr. Ruth.  Last time.  She would be a ringer at any limbo contest.  She could just walk under the pole.  That's how tall she is.  I've never seen a shorter person in my life.  My God.  God, she's brilliant, though.  She knows exactly, you know, when to get out.  She's 4'7".  4'7". 
[00:38:00]  That's what heals.  That's what heals.  Yeah.  She knew when to punch out.  It went well.  I can live now without any repercussions.  DrRuth.com.  Wow.  Man, I really wanted to get into it with her today, but...  You wanted to what?  I wanted to...  Oh, get into it with her.  Oh, okay.  God, the listeners just picked right up on it, too.  Joe, is it healthy to staple my yam bag to my balloon knot?  Yeah, this would have been serious questions only.  Someone probably told her, do not take any phone calls. 
[00:38:30]  Anthony online, too.  Serious rash on my ass.  What should I do?  Eric, play What's in My Pants with DrRuth.  Serious questions only.  Does she have a flat head?  Oh, well.  That was fun, though.  Sure.  Nice little surprise.  Yeah.  You want to take our first break, Anthony?  Yeah, I guess.  Oh, my God.  Hey, Ben's back in the studio.  Ben, grab a mic. 
[00:39:00]  Someone's suggesting we should have asked DrRuth  to do the Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  The Whiffle Ball Bat's bigger than her.  Put a lump on her head.  Anal for dummies.  I don't know.  You see, you're almost...  That's probably...  We could have had five more minutes,  maybe a couple of phone calls before she left,  if you didn't come out with Anal for Dummies.  They have all those dummies books.  Well, she's going to probably come in in a couple of months and go,  My new book, Anal for Dummies.  I thought of the title.  I was inspired. 
[00:39:30]  Wow, look at that.  Someone's saying Dice should take advice from Dr. Ruth.  Actually leaving after five minutes.  Yeah.  That's the best advice ever.  You could...  She's done radio for so long.  She knows.  She knows.  I've heard her on shows where the people get right into it and start going,  So, Dr. Ruth, how do you know about Anal?  Have you taken it up the pooper and stuff like that?  And she just, like Lee, she doesn't like that kind of question.  So she's so ready for it that the second you say Anal for Dummies, 
[00:40:00]  she's like,  Okay, goodbye.  Goodbye.  She took the book with her.  Yeah, she took the book with her.  Wait a minute.  We bought that book.  Nah, that's okay.  Tell her to sign it or something.  Yeah, maybe Rick's doing that.  Have her sign the book.  We'll hang it on the wall near Hot Shannon's naked body pictures.  She had the first sex advice show on the radio a long, long time ago.  And everyone used to listen to it.  Try to get a little advice. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  All right, Anthony, let's take a break.  Yeah, let's take a break.  There's plenty of stuff to talk about.  212-757-1027.  We'll be back in just a bit.  Fran is 84 years old.  Rick, you cannot have oral sex with Fran.  I'm sorry.  No, anal is okay.  The Wrangler and Diamond Dust Show.  Stay tuned for some real low radio.  1027-WNEW.  Stay out the bushes. 
[00:41:00]  You ain't wasting no time.  Stay out the bushes.  You ain't wasting no time.  Stay out the bushes.  You know when Jeffrey Jackson originally said that, Anthony?  I'm sitting at home going, what the F is this guy talking about?  Stay out the bushes.  Now we all understand.  Stay out the bushes.

[00:44:30]  Okay.  Hello, Judy.  Hi.  I'm big, dick, black.  You know what I'm talking about.  There is no racial bigotry here.  I do not look down on niggers, kites, wops, or greasers.  I'm big, dick, black.  It's not so much that I want to kill her.  It's just I want her not to be alive anymore.  Oh.  And now we're having fun.  I'm big, dick, black. 
[00:45:00]  Hell, you like to suck my ass.  Stay out the bushes.  Ouch.  Stay out the bushes.  Ouch.  Could you shut up?  Stay out the bushes.  Fuck it off, dick.  Stay out the bushes.  Never.  I am afraid I goofed.  Ha!  Ha!  Do somebody.

[00:46:30]  There you go.  We don't even have to comment.  Jesse Jackson has a love child.  I want to apologize to my family for my indiscretion.  You're a filthy whore. 
[00:47:00]  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  That one's the best, man.  The cycle park.  You're a filthy whore.  You're a filthy whore.  You're a kid toucher.  Some of the quotes in the paper are hilarious.  Well, he's got a back pedal.  You understand.  He was advising Clinton about his indiscretion, his marital indiscretion. 
[00:47:30]  And he had his pregnant chippy right there with him in the picture.  Now we'll pray together and try to get through this moment.  It's very hard on my family.  That's funny.  He goes, I have asked God and my family for forgiveness.  And God has been a lot more lenient. 
[00:48:00]  Me and my family have been praying together since when is yelling at the top of your effing lungs at each other praying.  Consider praying, right?  Well, the word God damn and Jesus Christ is in there a lot.  So that's praying.  But I don't know how the C word and a-hole and whatnot fits in.  So was mother effer.  He couldn't keep his toe in his pants. 
[00:48:30]  Doesn't matter.  Reverend.  Reverend Jesse Jackson, my ass.  I'm a man of God.  And pooh-ha.  Holy ass.  I just spit coffee.  Even Jesse loves the pooh-ha.  Pooh-ha.  Get in the bushes.  Stay out the bushes.  He was giving us all a little message a few months back.  She made out like a bandit, though. 
[00:49:00]  She lives in a $365,000 multi-bedroom spread.  For her spread.  Given $40,000 to relocate to L.A.  From where?  Guam?  Jesus Christ.  It's $40,000.  And she receives $10,000 a month from Jesse.  Where's the brother Jesse getting all this cake?  Where's he getting all this cash?  From his followers, Ann.  From his paid speeches?  His speeches.  Whatever it is. 
[00:49:30]  I'm sure donations, too, right?  And they have a picture of his love child.  And the Inquirer broke this, huh?  I want to say right now, we found out who the love child is.  It's our own black girl, everybody.  And where is Earl?  He's upset.  First, I thought it was the chick that William Kennedy Smith banged.  Because it's got the same blue dot over his face.  But I guess they're protecting the innocent. 
[00:50:00]  All right, Earl.  Calm down.  My little bastard.  A lot of people...  Come here, you little bastard.  A lot of people want to know if it's a white woman.  No.  No.  No, no, no.  No, he's into the ebony love.  Cafe latte.  He likes her.  Likes the black women.  One of his Rainbow Coalition members.  She apparently wrote a big paper on him.  Big thesis or something.  And he was so taken by it that he gave her a job and his penis.  Earl? 
[00:50:30]  Earl, I know you're feeling a little down today.  Uh, Reverend, uh, Reverend Penis.  Jesse Jackson, a hero of yours.  And, uh, well, not of yours.  I mean, your people.  Right?  No, of, uh, of Earl's.  Yeah, a hero.  Earl likes, uh, Jesse Jackson.  He's getting more strange than you.  How does that feel?  He's getting more...  Ah, hoo-ha!  He made a mistake.  Big deal.  Made a mistake. 
[00:51:00]  Big deal.  The guy goes around preaching all this, uh, crap, and now it amounts to bull.  He can't even keep his own schlong in his pants.  All right.  He's human like everyone else.  All right.  Is he?  All right.  He's human like everyone else.  Boy, everyone just, uh, in these, uh, sex scandals.  It's so cool.  Well, I'm not saying it's right.  It shoots down to everything that, that he's been talking about.  But you know what?  He's a human being.  He makes mistakes. 
[00:51:30]  You're forgiving him?  None of my business, quite honestly.  How come everybody will forgive me except my wife?  This is awful.  I can't even come up with a rhyme for this one.  I think we can come up with a few rhymes.  Oh, yeah.  I think so.  Earl, thank you very much for some great commentary, like always.  Thank you for that.  Let's go to the phones.  212-757-1027.  Jimmy, what's up, buddy?  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I just like to say that, uh, it seems that Jesse likes snatched poof, not just the critics, 
[00:52:00]  you know?  Very nice.  Thank you, Jimmy.  All right, guys.  You got to go in.  Oh, I didn't mean to do that.  I'm sorry.  Uh, let's go to Joe.  Joe, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up?  Oh, and how you guys rule?  Thank you.  Yo, man, you think the, you think the, uh, the population actually foul, Jesse's going  to have a problem with this?  Most of them do the same thing anyway.  Oh, come on.  Oh, don't ring the bell.  Come on.  In the back.  Come on.  You know what I'm talking about.  What are we ringing the bell for?  Joe, Joe, Joe, I got to say, I think all races do this type of type of stuff. 
[00:52:30]  No, you're right.  I mean, what if it was Bishop Daly?  If it was Bishop Daly, this would be a big thing on TV.  That's why I didn't F her.  You can't go Fing.  How old was this girl?  Do you have any idea how old she was?  How old?  She was, uh, 39.  Oh, it's not like a Twan of Roy type of deal, is it now?  She was 39 years old.  Oh, guys, who cares, man?  That guy's a bum.  The people are following me a bum, and if they don't see a problem with it, then they're  just stupid people anyway.  The worst part of this for him is that he's, uh, stepping out of the public eye. 
[00:53:00]  Because, you know, he loves that.  Pete, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  You know what it is?  I heard the reaction to Earl, and that's going to be a reaction from the entire populace  for six.  I don't want to use the N-word.  Okay?  They're all going to forgive him.  What's wrong with you guys?  Because this isn't going to be dragged out like Clinton.  Clinton gets a hummer in the White House, and we have to have federal prosecutors.  We've got to have people.  Well, Jesse isn't.  And then Jesse, but what Jesse did was, Jesse did the smart thing.  Jesse put his hands up and said, you got me.  I made a mistake.  It's all my fault. 
[00:53:30]  I hope my family forgives me.  I hope the people forgive me.  So, you know what we're going to do?  We're going to forgive them.  We're going to let it all go.  But, Pete, in fairness, I think everyone forgave Clinton as well.  No, no, no.  That's what he dragged him through the mud.  This doesn't go along race lines.  But it's almost like a double-edged sword.  It's like reverse racism.  Clinton gets hammered because he pulls his knob out in the White House.  This guy goes and has a kid, and everybody says, oh, you got to understand.  You know, things happen.  Things happen.  The Clinton thing was a lot more about perjury and whatnot. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, right.  Well, like I said, but come on.  Then you got to give Clinton props because he stuck it out until the bitter end, and he  denied, denied, denied.  Stuck it out was a problem.  Well, maybe that wasn't the problem, but anyhow.  Thank you, Pete.  Guys, good luck.  Ciao.  Hey, you got to give it to Jesse.  He didn't lie about it.  Yeah, I did it.  What I don't understand about, like, Jesse Jackson and the president stuff, these guys  got a lot of power.  Can't they get, like, hotter chicks?  That seems to be the thing.  You see Jesse Jackson's chick in the post today? 
[00:54:30]  They want...  That's no looker right there.  They want girls that are going to shut up, I guess.  I guess Jesse's chick shut up.  You know, they can go blabbing about it.  But that inquirer, my God, they ought to hire those people for the CIA, because they will  find anything on you.  Didn't we have some info on this story, like, a couple days ago?  Yeah.  They started dribbling in?  It was bubbling.  It was bubbling?  I saw something on Drudge, too.  It said, a major announcement about Jesse.  And I kept refreshing, going, come on, bring it. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  Anthony, you did hear that Clinton's getting an office, like, right next to us here.  How hilarious.  Oh, yeah?  Where's he going to be?  We will see Clinton on the streets of New York.  Wait, he's getting an office right across the street.  We will probably bump into the president.  I love the show.  Can I come up for Teen Week?  Right.  Carnegie Hall.  He's going to be right at Carnegie Hall.  Nice.  He, uh, what, he already rented office space, right?  Yeah.  It kind of blows, though, because it's going to screw traffic up, because he's still got  the Secret Service and everything.  And isn't it ironic that Carnegie Hall is where the voyeur bus started out? 
[00:55:30]  He could have jumped out.  Hey, let me jump on.  Take her out.  Well, hey, I'm being busted.  Get your hands on me.  Ah, Psycho Mark.  I can't believe Earl ducked out of the studio without saving his guy.  This is Jackson.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  Now, we wonder why we're all the money he's spending with the Rainbow Coalition's going.  To putting up his bitches in their houses.  It's the bitches that are gitchens.  It's the bitches that are gitchens.  He's putting up all that money that he gets from the Rainbow Coalition, and people thinking 
[00:56:00]  it's going to all these good causes, and he's putting up his little tarts.  You know, he refuses to admit where any of that money goes.  He still, to this day, refuses to admit where any of that money goes.  Of course.  That money goes, and now we know.  He's bagged some money.  And chicks, chippies, as they call them.  Little chippies.  Earl has no balls at all.  This is his man.  He just walks out of the studio.  Well, he just drove like 22 straight hours, too, man. 
[00:56:30]  All right, Mark.  Just ponderous, man.  That's in ponderous.  That's in ponderous.  Thank you.  If you think this is the first indiscretion on Jesse's part, I don't know anything Jesse  Jackson's done in the past.  But with this surfacing now and how quick he fessed up to it, I can only assume there's  so many skeletons in that closet.  He should have taken his own advice.  Stay out the bushes.  That's right.  You've been doing that.  Now, what happens in these cases, though, now that one came forward, though, you watch  what happens in the coming months.  Anytime. 
[00:57:00]  Remember with Clinton?  It was like, okay, here's one.  It just exploded.  Yeah.  There was rumors that Clinton had a black love child.  Remember that one?  That's right.  They were never able to prove that one?  They confused him with Jesse.  And now that they know what this one woman is getting in terms of money, the other's going  to be like, he ain't getting that.  Where's mine, Jesse?  That little bitch, I saw her, I saw that bitch, you give her $40,000 and $10,000, she  ain't nothing but nasty. 
[00:57:30]  Talk to the hand, Jesse.  Man, don't even pay for my weed.  I'll see you guys later.  All right.  Thanks, Mark.  Bye, guys.  Call me now, Jesse Jackson.  You'll be looking at Bill Clinton.  Then you should be looking at yourself, Jesse.  I'm looking at, I see two teacup cards here, Jesse.  What does that mean?  It means you'll be putting your junk where it shouldn't go. 
[00:58:00]  Call me now.  I was watching her right before Conan O'Brien last night, just thinking of you, laughing  my ass off.  But she's with the cards.  Yeah, she's from Jamaica, Queens.  Right.  Jesse, my cards be telling me you should stay out the bushes.  Cheryl, what's up?  Hi.  Hey.  I just want to say that.  Nobody is perfect, right?  Right.  All right.  I think we can all agree with that.  You know something?  It happens to white.  It happens to white men, black men, yellow men, pink men, purple men.  It happens to everybody. 
[00:58:30]  Hey.  Right?  Wow.  She's the lady from TV.  Yeah.  Jesse, call me now.  Hey, Cheryl, you got your cards out?  We want to know what the lineup of WNEW is going to be.  We're hearing rumors we're going to have a brand new lineup here at WNEW very soon.  No, it's going to be.  Same as the old lineup, but they're going to be calling it the new lineup.  Uh, the sports guys.  Right.  Can you just say, call me now?  Call me now.  No.  Go.  Yell it out.  Go, call me now.  Call me now. 
[00:59:00]  That's how he sounds.  Are you into any of that voodoo stuff?  No, I'm not.  No?  The tarot cards or anything?  You don't read the cards or anything?  No, no, no.  No?  Well, I just want to say that nobody's perfect, right?  Oh, boy, I've been seeing the penis card coming out.  Yeah.  Jesse, call me.  But nobody's perfect, because there's sure lots of white guys out there have children  that their wives don't know about.  I think we said that.  I think we said that.  Yeah, it has nothing to do with race. 
[00:59:30]  It has something to do with this guy.  Yeah, he's human, and he made a mistake.  But I hate these people that are going around preaching, preaching, preaching, and then  they turn around and do the same thing.  Jimmy Swaggart.  Remember him?  Oh, God.  There you go.  Another man of the cloth.  A bubbling idiot.  Yeah, that tripped over his own penis on the way to fame and fortune.  And it's the same thing.  It makes you a huge hypocrite.  Yeah, no, because Jimmy Swaggart, he made me cry a lot of times watching him. 
[01:00:00]  I didn't see him.  I can't see you, my lord.  That clip is still one of the funny ones.  That is a great one.  Wait, something's coming in on my cards.  Uh, Jesse, pull out, Jesse.  Pull out now.  Okay, guys.  Bye.  Bye.  All right, call us back, Cheryl.  Okay, bye.  Squeeze it at the base and pull out, Jesse.  All right, well. 
[01:00:30]  Eff her face, Jesse.  Eff her face.  Jesse, you'll be listening.  Give her a TFing, Jesse.  Call me now.  Hey, we got to take a break.  Girl, I see a pearl necklace in your future.  Jesse, flip her over. 
[01:01:00]  Flip her over, Jesse.  Jesse.  Jesse, you're listening.  Tag her in the dumper.  And why wouldn't he just wrap it?  Wrap it up.  Wrap, wrap, wrap, wrap it up.  Wrap, wrap.  You know why?  Because even Jesse knows it just don't feel good. 
[01:01:30]  I hate that.  A condom that feels as good as the real thing.  Wrong.  I can't, dumbass.  All right, we do have to take a break, Anthony.  Yeah.  Nice.  Jesus, Rick.  Rick, man.  The F, man.  We'll be back.  Opie and Anthony show.  The sickest, most disgusting people having sick sex.  This is going to help us continue being number one, right?  Yeah.  Sampy!  Do you know more?  1027. 
[01:02:00]  WNEW.  Listen to Ron and Fez just before Opie and Anthony.  Radio is a commercial business.  And you have to do what people want.  It's a load of crap.  We don't do traffic.  We don't do weather.  No.  We do nothing.  Did you just sit here and talk all day?  That's it.  It's like the worst radio on the planet.  Yes, we know.  Opie and Anthony show.  We're so late.  Uh, I'm just ready for you.  Uh, Jackie, what's going on? 
[01:02:30]  I am never, ever, ever having sex again because of your show.  Yeah, what happened to me?  Like, Walter, that Gary Coleman stuff, this fetish thing?  Yeah.  Ugh.  You don't know what we're going to throw at you.  What about the fetish with the knives?  You like knives?  Get out of here!  That was my best friend.  Anyway.  Hold on, Jackie.  All right, now we've got to explore your little sick world.  Okay, fine.  You're into knives?  Yeah, I'm kind of... 
[01:03:00]  Nice bagel knives.  Get out of here!  Bagel knives going up and down.  What, you like knives being dragged across you or something?  Not like blood or anything.  No, but just a thought that something might happen?  No, it just feels good.  It's buttered.  It feels good.  But, I mean...  I'm going to kill you, Rob.  Rob, get...  Wait, get Rob on the phone.  All right, hold on.  Rob?  Hey, Rob.  Yeah?  It's O&A.  Yeah.  She likes knives? 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  Are you her boyfriend?  No, I'm her roommate.  And what's the deal with her?  She's probably told you.  Actually, I found out by playing around one day.  I pulled out a knife and I just, like, grazed it against it.  And she was like, oh.  So, obviously, I kept going with it.  And she squirmed all over the place and was leaving slug trails and stuff.  Oh, holy ass.  Because of knives?  Yeah.  That's pretty wild.  I'm telling you. 
[01:04:00]  All right, get her back in the phone.  All right.  They want you back.  But Nicole had the same fetish.  I swear, Nicole had that same fetish.  And I would drag the knives across her neck.  And she loved it.  I'm listening to you all the time.  I love it.  That's better than the Chewbacca defense.  Jackie.  I love it.  Pedro Guerrero once dragged a big saw blade across her.  Jackie.  Yeah.  If the knives are sharp, is it really a turn-on?  Yeah.  Have you had sex with a guy just using the knives and stuff? 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  Holy.  I've been wanting to come on your guy's show for, like, ever and ever and ever.  And how excited do you get when they're dragging the knives across your body?  Extremely.  Holy.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah.  Rock.  Why do you get so turned on?  I don't know.  It's just one of those things.  So, if we brought you down in the studio and we dragged knives all over your body, would  you have, like, an orgasm?  It's possible.  I don't...  I can't promise, but it's definitely possible.  But you would kind of get turned on at the very least. 
[01:05:00]  All right.  Listen.  All right.  Book it.  Listen.  Get your boyfriend to get a knife.  He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, your roommate.  I'm going to go get a knife, Rob.  And be a guest on a knife dragon?  I like the concept.  I can't believe I'm doing this on the phone.  All right.  Jackie.  Get naked.  He's got the knife.  He's got the knife?  Oh, my God.  What?  Wait, wait.  Wait.  She's really getting into it. 
[01:05:30]  Jackie.  Get the F out of here.  What?  Get out of here.  You like this?  Yes.  What is he doing?  Say.  What is he doing?  Say.  What is he doing?  He's dragging the knife all over?  Oh, my God.  She can't be for real.  Come on.  No.  I'm dead serious.  She sounds like she's not faking.  She's still going, and she's like five feet from the phone right now. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, back on her.  I don't want to hear you.  Yeah.  No offense to you.  You sound like a cool guy.  Let's hear her.  Hello?  Jackie.  Nice away from me.  They're trying to talk to me.  No, no.  Let him do this.  Take one for the key.  Fine.  Are you topless or anything?  No.  Oh, my God.  She's got it.  We've got to book her.  No, no.  Where's he putting the knife?  On his stomach.  On your stomach?  I'm going to kick you.  I have platform boots on. 
[01:06:30]  No, don't kick him.  The knife might...  Wow, this could be a radio first.  I'm stabbing.  Are you naked?  No.  All right, get naked.  Take your clothes off.  No.  Come on, please.  At least go topless.  Fine.  All right.  Let him drag your knife across you.  People are in their cars losing it, Jackie.  Just get your shirt off.  Listen up.  It's off?  All right.  What kind of boobs do you have? 
[01:07:00]  What is he doing?  Is this a scene from 8 Millimeter?  She's not faking it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Jackie, what was he doing with the knife?  He's dragging it all across my chest and stomach and... 
[01:07:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Across your boobs and stuff?  Yes.  How sharp is the knife?  It's a bagel knife.  A bagel knife?  Mm-hmm.  What is that?  Like a sharp knife?  It's like a bread knife.  Sharp, very sharp bread knife.  Long and serrated.  Yeah, right.  It's a serrated.  I've seen those, yeah.  They use them at the bagel store.  Yeah.  And it's very long.  Jackie, that is like the coolest thing I've ever heard, I think.  Does he scrape you a little with the...  He just drags it across, not too sharp, not the cut, but just sharp, like... 
[01:08:00]  Like on the sharp side, he drags it, what, just barely?  Yeah, just enough.  Where did this start?  He was just fooling around one day, and he dragged it across my stomach because it was  summer, and I had a hash on.  And it just...  Wow.  And you had no idea that this was a turn-on until that happened that day?  Really?  Hey, let him drag it, like, just around your very intimate area.  See?  Everyone was pissed off at us 15 minutes ago.  Look, we come back strong for you guys. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  Okay, let's listen.  Oh, my God.  Go away.  No.  No, don't send him away.  All right, we need the grand finale now.  Where's Rob?  Get Rob on the phone.  Okay, hold on.  Yeah.  Rob.  Rob.  Whatever.  You've got to listen to me very closely.  All right.  Plunge it into her chest.  No, no, no. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, sorry.  No, no, no, Anthony.  I thought that meant you were going somewhere.  No, I ain't O.J.  No, Rob.  Listen to me.  And you've got to trust me.  You have people freaked out all over the tri-state area right now, okay?  You've got to really work it now, all right?  All right?  All right.  She's going to say stop, but you keep going.  All right.  Just don't hurt her.  I have to go on record and say don't hurt her, okay?  No, that's not a problem.  All right.  Get Jackie on the phone.  All right.  All right.  And as soon as we start talking to her, you just go off with the knife, all right?  All right.  Hi, Jackie.  Hi, Jackie. 
[01:09:30]  I hate you. 
[01:10:00]  I hate you.  I hate you.  That makes up for laughing, Walter. 
[01:10:30]  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Jackie.  Yeah.  Holy S.  Wow.  That's pretty good.  That was insane.  Oh, my God.  Hey.  Hey.  Could you come in here?  Yes.  All right.  You've got to come in here.  We're going to use really sharp knives if you come into the studio, though. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  Really sharp.  You're going to be on the show tomorrow.  Tomorrow?  Yes.  Okay.  We can't wait.  Why don't you bring in your favorite knife?  I will.  All right.  Yeah.  Very good.  The first one to remove Excalibur from your van will inherit the kingdom.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Let me just put my foot on her arm.  Here we go.  Give it to our guy. 
[01:11:30]  Planted pretty deep.  Light of the week, man.  Oh, my God.  You guys are hysterical.  How is this show going to get better this week?  It's over, Johnny.  All right, Jackie.  You hold on.  I will hold on.  Someone will pick you up immediately and we'll get some information from you and we'll have  you come down here and do this live.  All right?  Okay.  All right.  Cool.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  That is the most important phone number ever.  Jackie in line 10. 
[01:12:00]  We got a videotaping for foundrymusic.com.  Oh, my God.  She hung up.  I'm kidding.  I just want to see your face.  Oh, you just put everyone in the panic.  That was good.  I saw everybody go, oh, oh.  See, you bastards.  You didn't have faith in us.  That's something.  Did you hear that?  She wasn't faking that.  You could completely cut.  Wow.  A knife.  At first, I'm like, all right, there's some gag going on here, but that was as real as it gets.  Rubbing a knife. 
[01:12:30]  She was topless.  Nice body.  The guy was rubbing a knife all over her body and it drives her nuts.  Can you believe that fetish?  God, that's kind of a dangerous fetish to have because if somebody holds you at knife  point, you're just, oh, doing that sound.  She'll get her sex toys from Ginsu.  The Ginsu.  The Ginsu.  Right.  Holy mackerel.  Nice.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Cool.  Well, we'll have her down here and drag a knife across her. 
[01:13:00]  We got to get some nice knives.  We have to get, like, really good cutlery sex.  Yeah.  Someone go out and get a good little reset.  How does she feel about meat cleavers?  Oh.  That could hack right through a bone.  We have to get, like, you and I have to do another guy.  We have to go three or four guys just working the body with a dragon and knives around her.  All right?  Yeah.  They didn't dump out of that, did they?  Oh, no.  They'd better not dump out of.  All right.  Cool.  Anthony, let's regroup.  Imagine a machete or a sword from, like, the Renaissance fair. 
[01:13:30]  She'd be off.  Impale her.  Yes.  Like Conan.  Rick, what'd she say?  Dylan!  Oh, Conan.  How sick was that?  Pretty sick.  Can I bring my axe?  Yeah, we're going to just bring very sharp knives.  All right.  Nice.  The tip to B squared.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Who else gets you a bus filled with naked jeans that you could see from the streets of that 
[01:14:00]  ass?  What a deal for new jeans.  Oh, come on.  You can't arrest a boy or a bus.  Now you read it.  287-WMW.  We want to talk about the monkey thing.  Yeah.  God damn glowing monkeys.  Yeah, they got all dirty.  When we brought this up during commercials, he's like, yeah, B, I heard about that.  And we're like, just shut up.  Just shut up, all dirty, until we get on the air. 
[01:14:30]  I got to hear his comments about this genetic.  Oh, by the way, not to jump on the subject, but I did do some research and I found out why  the government is actually behind the glow-in-the-dark monkeys.  Why?  Because they figure it'll be easier to spot your television leaving your apartment at  three o'clock in the morning.  Oh, my God.  All right.  What?  Wow.  Holy ass.  Oh, he's leaving.  Old Dirty, you better defend yourself. 
[01:15:00]  I'm not talking about Old Dirty.  I was thinking the same.  No, wait a minute.  This was one possibility that I came up with.  You're seeing a conspiracy theory happening.  Oh, no doubt.  All right.  Old Dirty.  I love when Old Dirty turns into Mulder.  Wait, wait, wait.  We got to give the details of the glowing monkey.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  Old Dirty, you can talk for her as long as you want.  All right.  Here's some of the details.  Scientists actually modified the DNA of one of those cute little Reese's monkeys, which  are just put on this earth for us to F with. 
[01:15:30]  And used some jellyfish DNA and put it into this monkey, a monkey egg, fertilized it, and  implanted it into some monkeys.  They say.  Tyrone, sit down.  They say.  Oh, my God.  Old Dirty.  Bring the bell.  They say it was done so they could better track some of these cells and DNA in these 
[01:16:00]  animals to do medical research.  It's easier to see if they're glowing.  But some of the side effects are, you know, some of the stillborn fetuses and the fetuses  they remove to do research on before they're born have glow-in-the-dark hair and nails  and whatnot.  They glow under certain lights.  This is no doubt a conspiracy.  These are coming down from the highest levels of the whole genetic manufacturing process. 
[01:16:30]  Look at the way.  Look at the way.  Jamaican Mike's looking at him.  He's ready to hit you upside your head with his swing.  He'll pull that thing out like the Gallagher hammer.  Snap your head.  So how is this an X-Files-like conspiracy against minorities all dirty?  All right.  Let's say a brother gets caught.  Remember, allegedly, he's innocent before, you know, and all that.  Right.  Proven guilty.  You know, the process and all that.  It looks good on paper. 
[01:17:00]  Right.  So let him know, Norton.  So then once they have sent a book and they give him the Kool-Aid, inside this Kool-Aid  will be the genetic material.  They can't resist Kool-Aid, right?  Yeah, well, you've got to eat a little something, right?  Am I right?  A little bologna and cheese.  You've got to have your sugar water.  Before you know it, it's going to be turning up in mac and cheese.  You know what I'm saying?  So then you're going to make them drink this.  Yeah.  And once they leave, they'll be tracking them from up top.  From satellites?  No, no.  Helicopters.  Because, you know, they ain't going to glow that much. 
[01:17:30]  So you're saying that they're going to use this to track minorities.  Yes.  Unbeknownst to the individual.  They don't have to do that to track minorities.  Code blue.  Code blue control.  He's on to us.  That's not true.  All they got to do is put them to have a homing device in a white lady's purse.  Why would they want to...  Yeah, thanks, man.  That bell just...  Ow!  You can't hit that bell enough.  I know.  So why would they want to mess with the genetic material of a monkey and a jellyfish, dude? 
[01:18:00]  They didn't feed the little monkey Kool-Aid, first of all.  It's a very involved process.  So they're talking about screwing with the eggs, the monkey eggs.  Monkey eggs.  Yeah, monkey eggs.  They're talking about screwing with monkey eggs before the monkey's born, obviously,  and then they implant them, and you have beautiful monkeys.  He's a glow.  Damn you glowing monkeys to hell. 
[01:18:30]  If only Dr. Zaius glowed, I could have seen him riding up to that cave.  The gorillas wouldn't have taken me by surprise.  Help me, Dr. Zaius.  Help me, Zira.  Cornelius.  That was a clever ruse I pulled on him.  It would better suit people to see monkeys now if they glow so that when they take charge 
[01:19:00]  in the future, like in Planet of the H, I could see them in the dark.  Damn glowing monkeys.  Nova.  Nova.  I taught you to glow.  Look at you.  Damn glow.  And then if they can genetically enhance monkeys like Zira to have puffy vag.  Puffy vag.  Glowing puffy vag.  I love it.  You ever see a big red mandrel ass? 
[01:19:30]  Those big, like on the Discovery Channel.  Where they have the baboon and monkeys sitting in the tree with those big red asses hanging.  Imagine if they glowed.  Like a homing device.  Glowing Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen.  That's a goal of mine.  Oh, my God.  It gets a pumpkin in my loincloth, doesn't it?  Glowing monkeys.  That's not a conspiracy, old dirty. 
[01:20:00]  What is the, what's the, what's going on here?  They can track cells.  And the jellyfish, my brother.  What's going on?  So they can track cells.  Can't they track them now?  They're messing with the DNA so we can, like, figure out some of these diseases.  Like Alzheimer's.  Yeah.  Let me tell you something.  Mike has a problem, I think.  Mike?  Yeah.  What's up?  How's it going, guys?  All right.  You guys rule.  I think you really should listen to O.J. because he's privy to militaristic information.  There you go, my brother.  Militaristic information.  Good job, O.J. 
[01:20:30]  Give me your terminology.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  I don't know why.  Every, every time they try to come up with something, they're doing this, making glowing monkeys.  It's always for Alzheimer's.  And I think, I think Alzheimer's, I'm sorry, I'm going to get a lot of flack, but this should be put on the back burner.  Because what other disease can you just even forget you have?  It's not like you wake up, cancer patients wake up and go, geez, I totally forgot I had cancer today.  You know, work on that.  But the Alzheimer's people, they don't even know.  They don't care.  It's the families that are crushed by it. 
[01:21:00]  Keep loaning the same people money over and over.  Yo, let me tell you that.  I think, I think they're closer to a cure.  They're just keeping it on the side so the pharmaceutical companies can keep making money, dude.  What, for Alzheimer's?  Yeah, for all them diseases, dude.  They got all the cures, man.  What's up?  I'm putting all my support behind the glowing monkey program, which will be used to shoot Soviet missiles out of the sky.  We're going to fire glowing monkeys and disassemble the missiles that are inbound. 
[01:21:30]  Isn't that what it's for, Mommy?  Hello?  Hey, you were talking about cloning Anthony.  I was.  Why are you calling me Anthony?  My name is Rutherford Bees.  You have a problem with cloning.  I have a problem with the cloning.  Now they're cloning endangered species.  I saw this wacky, endangered, moose-cow-like thing that is almost completely extinct.  So they cloned it using a cow to carry this altered embryo of this wacky, endangered thing. 
[01:22:00]  And it died after a couple of days.  Don't you think, that's us humans thinking we're so high and mighty that we're going to bring back extinct species.  You think God is looking down and going, no.  You're not effing with my work.  If this is supposed to be extinct, I've got a reason for it.  And no people are going to help the cause.  That's why, like, we're looking for dinosaur DNA so we can get a few more of those running around.  Like, it's bad enough when you park your goddamn car under a tree in the summer and it comes out looking like Norton's bed. 
[01:22:30]  You ever see that?  Can you imagine a goddamn, how much window washing you need to wash pterodactyl crap off your windshield?  You know if we could do it, there'd be dinosaurs chewing on the walls of some of the buildings around here.  There's a reason.  Yeah.  Let me revert to Jurassic Park.  It's not supposed to happen.  Yo, that's right.  They're trying, though.  The manipulation of the genetic code is something. 
[01:23:00]  That's my word, son.  That's only your word.  Because that's in no one else's dictionary.  Is that the Code 45 talking there?  Yeah, right here.  Manipulation.  Yeah, courtesy of Vinnie the Racist.  He dropped off that Code 45.  Yeah, but then Limoang, he cracks.  Man, I was going to, ooh.  How's he going to crack my 40 like that without permission, dude?  He should have called in advance.  He was going to do something like that.  You think some of that glow gunks in there? 
[01:23:30]  Ah, they're putting in the Code 45.  Very good, Big Cap.  That's a vehicle for administering the glow-in-the-dark DNA, my brother.  There you go.  The brothers are also mad, some of the activists, that there's so many liquor stores and malt liquor in the neighborhoods.  It's the dumping ground, my brother.  Where are you going to get rid of this stuff?  That's what you demand, my friend.  You ain't going to go to Scarsdale and sell a case of this at some, you know, some, some  call for love.  My God, love you.  I need some Cult 45. 
[01:24:00]  Love you.  Love you.  Where's my cult?  No, Cult 45 is something they carry to keep black people out of those neighborhoods.  Somebody.  I need, I don't need a spell.  I need a support.  I'm not saying it's right.  Don't tell me.  I'm reporting facts.  Voss is disgusted with you today.  No, he's not.  Listen to some of his material.  All right, we've got to take a quick break.  We'll be back.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Opie Anthony.  Opie Anthony.  Opie Anthony. 
[01:24:30]  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  It's the O&A Show.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Megadath killed the king.  Killed the king. 
[01:25:00]  All right.  Breaking news, Anthony.  Yeah, we love breaking news.  We are your news source.  We are your concert connection and your news source.  Yes, breaking news on WNEW.  With your anchors, Opie and Anthony.  And the Opie and Anthony news team.  Here now, Opie and Anthony.  Thank you, Anthony. 
[01:25:30]  Anthony's off today.  I'm filling in.  I'm Anthony.  I'm Anthony.  I don't give a crap you're off.  They act like they're important.  Who cares?  Just tell me the goddamn news.  News with Roger Grimsby.  And then they get there.  Roger's off tonight.  Who cares?  Just tell me who died today.  But I did see him drinking at a bar.  Hmm. 
[01:26:00]  That would be a little tough considering he's dead.  He's dead.  He is.  Anyway.  How did it happen?  Oh, my God.  OJ's ex, Christine Prady's, home broken into.  This is just breaking.  Miami-Dade police confirm they are responding to the home of Christine Prady,  former girlfriend of OJ Simpson.  Police confirm that units are on the scene at Prady's Kendall Townhouse.  At this time, it is unclear if anything was taken. 
[01:26:30]  A crime scene unit is on the scene.  This story, minutes old, so it is still developing.  Dude, if she's dead in this house, no one's sure if anything was taken.  Maybe even a life.  Who knows?  You know, who would ransack Christine Prady's house? 
[01:27:00]  Let's think about this for a second.  Hmm.  Hmm.  There's so many people to choose from.  It really could be anybody when I think about it.  I'm thinking it could be two people, Anthony.  Um, okay.  Who?  O.  Or J.  O or J.  Or perish the thought, it's both of them together.  Because you know when O and J get together.  Open up, man.  Don't worry about, Mark.  My dog just caught me.  Yeah.  Got you?  I was breaking into the house. 
[01:27:30]  Was it?  The girl next door, you know?  My girl, Christy.  It was you.  All I was.  Honey, give me that she called me red and it.  Creeping with the girl next door.  Ransack in her effing house.  We were both back naked, hanging on the bathroom.  Ha, ha, ha.  How could I forget that I had given her a show?  Ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, it was me.  All this time, she was standing in bed, she never stood up.  It was me. 
[01:28:00]  All this time, I'm running home in my black swimsuit suit in Black Wings Pass.  I don't know how to play.  Did she say a name?  I don't know how to play.  Never admit to a word what she say.  I used to claim I used to love, baby.  No way.  All this time, she caught me on the counter.  What's with me?  Caught me banging on the sofa.  O.J., O.J., look, I know you're in there, O.J. 
[01:28:30]  I see you through the window.  You got your black swimsuit on.  You're on a cap.  You're on a Harley shoes and a little gloves.  The scene's getting louder.  It wasn't me.  She said I didn't want to.  Can you hold me?  Honey, give me that she called me red and it.  Creeping in her effing house.  We were both back naked, hanging on the bathroom.  I had tried to keep the...  You know, Anthony, it could be one other person.  Who?  Pedro Guerrero.  Oh, no. 
[01:29:00]  I'm waiting for Pedro Guerrero.  I never used to see you.  No more news?  Video.  A video?  Of what?  Let's take a look.  Ben is right on it.  Well, what else does the story say?  As we wait for the...  Well, it's very breaking news,  so they just kind of say police have responded several times in the past few months  to the residents most commonly...  residents most recently  when the couple Simpson and Prady became involved in a heated argument. 
[01:29:30]  A neighbor called police.  Simpson was gone when the police arrived.  No one was arrested,  but police did give Christine a domestic violence pamphlet.  She's a little underkill there.  Just give her a friggin' Kevlar vest and a helmet.  And a throat protector.  You know how he works.  O.J., the pool of O.J.  You gotta throw her in the swimming bowl.  Let's go to Paul.  Paul, what's going on?  Paul?  Yeah.  What's going on? 
[01:30:00]  Hey, what's up?  You saw that on Fox News?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know how much detail I can really add to it,  but as soon as I saw that breaking news,  I knew I had to call you guys.  And that's all they're saying right now?  Yeah.  You know, they just showed we tuned in,  we see John Gibson.  All of a sudden, they're like,  we see a helicopter shot of his girlfriend's place.  I was chipping golf balls again, I swear.  What a coincidence.  You know, if he broke into a house,  I mean, with all the evidence he left in a murder scene,  he's going to leave someone around the house if it was him. 
[01:30:30]  If it was him.  Listen to me.  O.J. broke into her house.  She could be dead on the floor.  All right, Paul, thank you.  Psycho Mark, who works for Fox.  Fox!  Our news connection,  our actual news connection is Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark.  All they're saying right now is Channel 10  has got their chopper down in Miami right now,  outside the house,  and they're sort of just standing by for new developments.  But they said that they don't know whether she was home or not.  So they don't know if anybody was hurt.  Wait, they don't know if she's home or not? 
[01:31:00]  They don't know.  Right now, they don't know whether she was home  or whether anyone was hurt.  Oh, no.  Oh, if he did this again.  You know, I hate a loss of life just like the next guy.  I really do.  I really do.  But in some sick way,  I'm separating myself from this woman, Christine Prady.  I know she's a human being,  but for a second, let me put that away.  I am putting away the fact that she's a living human being.  Don't you kind of hope he killed somebody? 
[01:31:30]  I'm sorry.  I really, because it's like a movie.  It's a sequel.  He fucks as this man's kid takes his nose.  It's like a sequel.  Just so everyone can say,  I told you.  I told you.  I told you.  All right, Mark.  Well, if there's any more breaking news,  I'll let you guys know.  Thank you.  I left another message on the machine.  I had to get it.  Unfortunately, I got it with an axe all through her house. 
[01:32:00]  I thought the kitchen table was a phone,  so I hit that with the axe.  And then her refrigerator looked a lot like a new Panasonic cordless,  so I hit that.  And then she came up and looked just like a telephone.  So I hit her with the axe.  Eric, what's up?  What's up, guys?  I hate, you know, I hate, you know, for someone to die,  but in a way, kind of, you know,  you don't, like, kind of want her to be dead in a way.  Look, I know, and I wouldn't say that 
[01:32:30]  unless I was thinking everybody's thinking like this.  Of course you hate the fact that someone has to die,  but for another trial of this injury?  Well, goddamn, I'm in.  And I want to say right now, black people owe me an apology.  All right, thank you.  We all know it's just a matter of time anyway.  Before he kills somebody.  He's an A-bomb.  And we all know.  He's a bomb.  We all know she was asking for it anyway.  Oh, no.  Oh.  Oh.  Mark, what's going on? 
[01:33:00]  Oh, hey.  Hey.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Ash.  Yeah, great show last week is what I meant to say.  Dude, how friggin' retarded is this?  What up?  How friggin' retarded is this?  Well, we don't, you know, we got to go on record and say  we have no idea what's going on here.  No, hey, look, if that house is ransacked, O.J. did it.  Who else would have broke in there?  I know.  You know what I mean?  He's sitting there and he's like, oh, no, I was playing golf.  Are you kidding me?  I'm actually on scene right now looking for the real burglars.  Yeah, I can understand if this chick has been at her house 
[01:33:30]  broken into several times before.  But, like, they just broke up again.  She's going to be upstairs in the bathroom and he's going to be like,  oh, I'll put it in the bathroom toilet.  And people will think she died like Elvis.  I don't even know what that means.  He's like the friggin' invisible man, though,  because no one's seen him.  How does O.J. get in a house and ransack it?  And what's he taking?  I got to grab both gloves this time.  And he's like an idiot.  Okay, I have a checklist this time.  Both gloves, no DNA. 
[01:34:00]  Anthony, this just in.  O.J. has arrived on the scene and is seeking the real burglar.  Of course.  Oh, yeah, I was down the street getting a Twinkie.  And I heard it over the APB.  What, are you kidding me?  This guy's an idiot.  He's going to get caught again.  And this time he's going to go away because people are going to be like,  are you kidding me?  F him.  You guys rule, man.  Thanks, Mark.  What did I do?  Obscure reference of the day goes to Don.  Guys, dick jokes on CNN right now. 
[01:34:30]  Kato Kaden was at McDonald's buying O.J. some fries.  It wasn't me.  God damn.  Valerie is saying that Anthony is sick.  Why?  For wishing she was dead.  All right, Valerie.  I cannot believe you guys wish that poor girl's dead just for entertainment value.  Well, you know, I tried to preface it like I don't want anyone to die.  Valerie, how stupid is she, first of all?  Oh, she's completely stupid.  And honestly, she probably deserves it. 
[01:35:00]  But she's still a person and you don't want to hope she's dead.  No, I didn't say, that's what I'm saying is I really don't wish any harm on this girl.  But the fact of the matter is a lot of people are in their heads right now going,  God, it will be so entertaining if this chick is dead.  I'm not saying I wish she was dead.  I'm saying if she is dead, God, it's going to be great.  Oh, my God.  You are going straight to hell for that statement.  It's O.J. too.  Yeah, for that statement. 
[01:35:30]  A little late.  I'm already on the chutes and ladders chute down to hell.  The guy's coming right for us.  I mean, doesn't she see the signs?  I'm sure she does, but nobody thinks it will happen to them, I'm sure.  Oh, please, please don't look under the kiddie pool.  I'm in the bag under the kiddie pool.  Please don't look.  Oh, they just kicked it off me.  I'm not opening my eyes.  My eyes are sure.  Hello.  I was just chipping golf balls under the kiddie pool.  Well, what happened? 
[01:36:00]  All surprised.  Well, what happened in here?  Hey, Phil, what's up?  Yeah, O.J., we're back for the answering machine tapering.  That's it, again, for the answering machine tapering.  Is there a Hertz commercial shoot in Chicago tomorrow?  Oh, boy.  God damn the O.J.  Where is O.J.?  Does he have an alibi this time?  Does he have a steel trap alibi?  Because if he has an alibi for this one, I will laugh my ass off. 
[01:36:30]  Kelly, what's going on?  Kelly.  Yes.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, did somebody check to make sure all the steak knives are in the house?  The Jinsu's all missing.  Well, we'll have to wait and see.  Next thing, there's going to be a white Bronco riding on the freeway.  It's a developing story.  I want info now. 
[01:37:00]  I hate this.  I want 24-hour coverage starting right now until they find out where O.J. was, where Christine is, what he was doing.  All right, Rob, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  This girl, Valerie, calls in and goes, how can you say you hope this girl's dead, this poor girl?  She went out with a murderer.  I mean, is she an idiot?  Is she dead?  She deserves to be dead.  That's true.  I mean, it's like going and smacking a pit bull in the face and saying, oh, the pit bull bit me. 
[01:37:30]  What do you expect?  Yeah.  Thank you, Rob.  All right.  All right.  Because I need to know.  Aren't you kind of obsessed now?  We can't do the rest of the show.  Now, I have to know where O.J. is right now.  There's a crime scene investigation going on at his ex-girlfriend's house.  Gee, what a surprise that is.  You know what would be a great idea, Anthony?  The O.J. camp. 
[01:38:00]  Where you can track O.J. 24 hours a day.  All the time.  Right.  You track O.J.  Look, they put this dot in my ass with a radar tracking device.  You can track O.J.  Next reality show from Fox.  O.J. Island.  O.J. on an island with beautiful girls that look just like Nicole.  Which ones are found in their little hut the next day gutted?  Here's the joke.  All of them.  Because in one way or another, they all pissed me off.  And I'm O.J. 
[01:38:30]  O.J. Survivor.  You go through hard tests on O.J. Survivor, like dating O.J.  Who wins?  I don't want to lift a cat out of the bag.  It's very suspenseful.  They always want to keep a who wins secret.  But I'll tell you, no one.  They're all dead.  Because I'm the O.J.  Anthony, what does my ex-girlfriend Christine Prady and Dale Earnhardt have in common? 
[01:39:00]  What's that?  Figure it out, eh-hole.  Anthony, Dan from Hoboken.  I don't want her dad just beat up a little.  Yes, it's the O.J. again.  Oh, my God.  I love this.  We really don't know what's going on.  Christine Prady's home broken in town.  O.J.'s ex. 
[01:39:30]  Helicopters, crime scene investigators at the house, Opie.  What's going on in that house?  What's the condition of the house?  Where is Christine Prady?  Is she safe?  Where is O.J.?  Does he have an alibi?  These questions need to be answered.  Before I can do anything in my life.  I can't live my life without knowing.  John.  I'm a tool.  John.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, how you going, guys?  Listen, I agree with Anthony.  I mean, I hate to see somebody lose their life, but Jesus Christ, I want to see this guy get convicted of something. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, we really need to know.  I just want to see the trial again, and I want to see him go to jail.  I didn't do it again.  Look at the old cast.  It's like an eight is enough reunion show.  What are you just talking about?  Weal out all the old lawyers.  Get Al Cowling's back.  Thanks, guys.  Driving Mr. O.J.  I'm just trying to drive you from the Midas scene.  Driving Mr. O.J.  I'm looking for a videotape here. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, very full.  A lot of people very interested in this story.  Well, we should take a break.  Yeah, let's see if we can get any more news.  We're trying.  We're trying the best we can.  Right now, I am like a heroin addict, but I need O.J. news.  Wait, one of our hotlines is ringing.  Come on.  Come on.  It's O.J.  Hey, I wasn't there. 
[01:41:00]  No, no, no.  I'm golfing.  Hi, Christine.  This is O.J.  I just want to call and say hello.  If I see you out with another guy, I will slit your goddamn throat.  I swear to you, I'll gut you like a fresh-killed kid.  Uh-oh.  Maybe I shouldn't have left this message.  Okay, I'll be able to ransack your house and slit your throat in like ten minutes, so don't go nowhere. 
[01:41:30]  But it doesn't mean that I'm serious.  Now I'm all covered in blood.  I lost the glove, and I banged on the air conditioner a couple of times.  Oh, baby.  O.J. did it again.  I done killed that bitch.  Uh-oh.  Oh, baby.  O.J. did it again. 
[01:42:00]  I'm not that innocent.  You see my problem is fear.  Hey, uh, Christina.  Ah!  Oh!  Ah!  No, don't make those sounds.  Ah!  My knife went off as I was cleaning it.  I didn't think it was loaded.  Oh, I think I'm seeing a picture here.  Wait a minute. 
[01:42:30]  Is that her?  Let's see.  Peeking through the door?  I think it's...  See?  Does it look like her face kind of peeking through the door?  Ah, yes.  God damn it!  This just in, Christine Pratty.  Looks like she's alive.  Looks like she's alive.  Looks like she's alive.  Ah, that blows.  Yeah, her, uh, her home was ransacked. 
[01:43:00]  Ransacked.  If you're just tuning in, and, uh, we're trying to get to the bottom of the story.  Now there's an updated picture of her peeking out from the door, right?  That's what it looks like.  It looks like, uh, Christine Pratty's face.  Kind of like the door opened, the news camera's there, and half her face is sticking out.  Anthony.  Well, maybe O.J.'s holding her head up.  Okay, so they're still home. 
[01:43:30]  They're still home.  O.J.'s behind there, with his hand in her mouth.  Hello.  No, I'm fine.  I'm just here with O.J.  O.J. left about a hour ago.  Ted, what's going on?  I'm not just a head on O.J.'s hand.  Oh, no, no.  How are you guys?  I don't see any body on that head yet.  I'm peeking out from the door.  I just got out of the shower.  God.  What's up, Ted?  Yeah, I heard the police have a new, uh, surveillance system called, uh, O.J. 
[01:44:00]  The O.J.  The O.J.  The O.J.  The O.J.  It's the O.J.  That's funny.  The O.J. recovery system.  That would be great.  You can always find out where he is.  Just put it into the police recovery system, and you'll find out where the O.J. is.  The O.J.  He's just friggin' holding up.  Thank you.  I love you guys.  Take care.  Hello.  It's me, Christine, Friday.  No, I'm fine. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, the furniture?  No, I just, I was cleaning.  O.J. left me here fine and dandy an hour ago.  You could look for him anywhere.  He went to look for Nicole's rear killer.  That videotaping, it does look, though, like, uh, she's alive.  But even if he broke into her house, then that's huge.  Uh, Christina, I don't doubt your story, but...  Why are there black man's fingers poking out of your face?  Oh, let me just...  That's okay.  I'll don't pull these back in. 
[01:45:00]  I love these, uh, Parks breakfast sausages.  That's what it is.  Let me just...  That's okay.  No, it's just some chocolate.  That's what was in my mouth, poking out.  See, now it's all sucked in, because, mm, that's good.  That's the chocolate.  Like I said, O.J. left.  He's really a great guy.  If you find him, though, in the next few minutes, and he's covered in blood,  that's just, uh, some jello we were making, and he spilled it on him.  Cherry jello.  Pay no attention to the fact that I have no body. 
[01:45:30]  And I am just a head waving in front of the door.  I'm an aspiring magician.  And this is one of those David Copperfield tricks.  See, look, my body disappeared.  Look, O.J. can drink water while I talk.  Oh, hello, officer.  See that?  O.J., we see you right behind the door.  Yes, you do.  He's right there.  Our pussy. 
[01:46:00]  It's O.J. and George.  O.J. and George.  You ever see a black woman's genitalia?  It looks like a wallet.  It's in the corner.  O.J. and George.  No, I'm a pussy.  I'm a pussy.  I'm a pussy.  I'm a pussy.  I'm a pussy.  I'm a pussy.  I'm a pussy.  Why don't you shut up, you murderer?  Oh, that's not funny. 
[01:46:30]  O.J. and George.  George now looks like my girlfriend's head.  Get in the coffin.  That's a good trick I do.  Disappearing body.  I'd ask you, officers, to cop a feel on my boobies, but they're in the living room.  Why is my body on the floor over there and my head is over here?

Uh, yeah, very excited.  They're telling us that Rick is calling in now, so maybe we should go right back to Antoinette.  Hello?  Uh, Antoinette? 
[02:00:00]  Yes.  Hello, Antoinette?  Hello?  Uh-oh.  What's wrong with the phones, Anthony?  Hello?  Antoinette, are you there?  I'm here.  We're trying to give away the trip to see Rick Springfield in Myrtle Beach, and we have  Antoinette on the line.  Antoinette?  Hello?  Hello?  I don't hear her.  Hello?  Hello?  She was on line four.  Hello?  Hello, Antoinette?  Hello?  Uh-oh.  Well, do we have another contestant?  Because I can't hear Antoinette.  Hello?  I think she might have hung up.  Hello?

Let me hear it.  Antoinette?  Hello?  What line was she on?  Hello?  She was on four?  She was on four.  Hello?  Because that light isn't on anymore over four.  Hello?  I would hate to hang up on her because she was the biggest fan.  She was the biggest fan, and we were literally three questions away from giving her the trip  to Myrtle Beach to see Rick Springfield. 
[02:01:00]  Hello?  Anthony, I think we've got to move on to the next caller.  Hello?  I hate to lose a fan like Annette because she seemed to realize it's a big deal.  She seemed to really know.  Yeah, but we've got to move on.  Hello?  Rick is on hold.  We've got Mary from Jersey that wants to play.  Hello?  We have Stephanie from, where's that, Medford?  Antoinette.  Hello?

When we do this Rick Springfield contest, we've had him on the show a few times, people 
[02:02:00]  that have called in and won these trips knew half of what she knew.  Hey, I can hear you.  Please.  Hello?  For some reason, this girl, full of knowledge, and now the phone screws it up, she would have  been going to Myrtle Beach.  Oh, God.  Please.  Hello?  I can't believe this.  Anthony, I don't think the phone screwed up, though.  Hello?  What do you think?  She is gone.  Look.  I don't see the light anymore.  I'm still here.  Hello?  Line four.  Now line four, it says Jerry is on line four.  No, it's not Jerry.  Hello?  Uh, let's go to...  I guess we're going to have to move on with the contest.  Yeah, that's a shame.  No, hello?

[02:19:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Is this the best radio you guys can come up with?  1027 WNEW.  Hello?  Can you hear me?  And we're back with the Opie Anthony show.  Hello, guys, guys, can you hear me?  1027 WNEW.  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  Hello?  Thanks for checking us out today.  Hello?  We've had a lot of fun so far, and we gave away that trip to see Rick Springfield in Myrtle  Beach.  Very excited.  Mike.  With the meet and greet front row tickets. 
[02:19:30]  Yes.  And dinner with the Springfield family.  Hello?  Hello, guys.  We had a little phone problem, but we were taken care of, and Mike won the trip.  Oh, God, and I didn't win that trip.  I knew those answers.  Hello?  Hello?  Anthony, we've got to move on to other things.  Yeah.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Also want to thank Rick Springfield for calling in today.  Yeah.  That was great. 
[02:20:00]  That was a really good interview.  Hello?  The guy is just as cool and down-to-earth as he's always been.  You too?  Oh, God.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  He made it quick because he had a lot of radio stations he had to talk to.  And how about that little tidbit of news he came out with?  Hello?  That was something I don't think he was telling anybody, and we heard it here exclusively on  the Opie and Anthony show.  Hello?  Yeah.  It's amazing who's going to be performing with him in Myrtle Beach.  I know.  Hello?  Hello?  Very cool.  Very exciting.  Hello?  I'm a little distracted today.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm hearing voices in my head or something. 
[02:20:30]  Hello?  That happens sometimes.  I'm still here.  I'm still here.  It's cool, Opie.  You're not going crazy.  I'm still here.  I'm still here.  You hear voices all the time, though.  Yeah, Opie, the headphones might be a little tight.  Yeah.  Why don't you have somebody bring you new headphones?  Hello?  It's not a bad idea.  That's probably what it is.  Hello?  Anthony?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Anthony?  Yeah.  Hello?  Hello?  Someone better be counting out there.  Hello?  Anthony?  Yes, Opie?  I want to replay the Drew Boogie remixes that you brought in for us.  Yes?  Hey, Anthony, Anthony, I'm still here.  Looking forward to hearing that. 
[02:21:00]  I'll be Anthony.  I'm still here.  The Sandy Cain remix.  Hello?  Getting...  Hello?  I'll be Anthony.  I'm still here.  Let me tell you something.  Sandy Cain has to be the dumbest individual we've ever had on these airwaves.  Hello, guys.  I'm still here, guys.  I can think of no other person as stupid as Sandy Cain.  Because when she comes on here, nothing comes out of her mouth but moronic statements.  Both of you.  And she has got to be the dumbest person we've had.  Sandy Cain.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello? 
[02:21:30]  We've got to go to the phone.  Hello?  John's on line nine.  He's kind of bummed that...  Hello?  Antoinette, I think...  What's her name?  Didn't win the contest?  I think it was Annette.  Annette?  Annette.  Oh, Annette from Center Reach?  Yeah.  It's not Annette.  It's Antoinette.  Hello, guys.  Come on.  Can you hear me?  Annette knew so much about Rick Springfield, but unfortunately the phone screwed up.  Can you guys hear me, please?  John.  Hey, John.  Hi, John.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  The poor girl.  She didn't win.  That's a shame.  She knew so much about him, too. 
[02:22:00]  I know.  We're bumming about it.  But we moved on, and Mike is going down to Myrtle Beach to go see Rick Springfield.  Come on, guys.  Isn't there anything to call her back or anything?  I mean...  No, we didn't have a caller ID or anything.  I'm going to say, guys, hello.  Can you hear me?  She wasn't smart enough, John, to leave her number or anything, so we can't even call  her back.  Come on, guys.  It's a shame because the president seemed like he wanted to go.  Yeah, I know.  Well...  Can you guys hear me?  I'm sure they'll enjoy dinner with the Springfields and seeing the show and being backstage.  Hello?  I'll do anything.  Hello?  All right, John. 
[02:22:30]  Thank you.  Hello?  Thank you.  All right.  Hello?  Oh, God.  I can't believe this.  Hello?  Hello?  Oh.  Hello?  Remember when we gave away the trip to see Rick Springfield in Myrtle Beach?  Yes.  Did that about, what, an hour ago?  Very excited.  Mike won.  And Mike is on the line.  Mike's on the line, and he walks in.  Hello, please, guys.  I'm still here.  This is Anthony, guys.  That's it.  Mike on the line.  Mike on line 12.  Mike, Anthony. 
[02:23:00]  Mike, what's going on?  Hello.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  How are you doing?  You tell your wife and mother-in-law about Rick Springfield.  Guys, I've got to tell you, she was so happy when I called her at work.  Oh, no.  She is beside herself.  She doesn't know what to do.  She knows about the dinner with the Springfield.  Yeah.  She really is going to be thanking me for months to come on this one, guys.  That's great.  Well, congratulations, Mike.  Yeah.  She was just, you know, like I said, a real big fan, and I can't even believe I was able  to get through, especially with some of the people that were answering all those questions. 
[02:23:30]  I'm still here.  Some of them were really good.  Hello.  Mm-hmm.  Hello, guys.  Very good.  Well, congratulations.  Hello.  Hey, Mike.  Yeah.  What did your wife say when you told her she was going to be seeing the concert in the  front row?  Well, after she stopped screaming and jumping up and down to drop the phone, she came back  on the phone, and she said, how the hell did this happen?  And I explained it to her.  Hello.  It's that Springfield.  She's just really happy, and I think you guys have won a fan for life from my wife. 
[02:24:00]  Hello.  Yeah.  Well, that's great, Mike.  Yeah.  Well, have a great trip.  Hello.  And enjoy the concert.  Oh, God.  And you tell Rick we said hello.  Hello.  All right.  You got it, guys.  All right, Mike.  Easy.  Thanks, man.  Wait, wait.  Mike?  Yeah.  Hello.  Mike, you're not going to believe this.  What?  You are not going to believe this.  Hello.  As the final prize?  Oh, don't even tell me there's more.  Well, it was something we were working on.  We couldn't confirm it, but it has officially been confirmed. 
[02:24:30]  You're going to get a signed guitar from Rick Springfield.  Oh, wow.  Hello.  Holy cow.  That'll be great.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  That's incredible.  Hello.  So you got the backstage passes, the dinner, the trip to Myrtle Beach, front row tickets,  and the signed guitar from Rick Springfield.  Wow.  Oh, God.  Hello.  Like I said, my wife is just going to be so excited when I sound good with this.  Please. 
[02:25:00]  That's incredible.  You guys are the best when it comes to this stuff.  Thank you, Mike.  All right, Mike.  Hello.  Thanks for calling.  Who's your Rick Springfield station?  Hey, it's got to be you guys.  Opie and Anthony on 1027 NAW.  Thanks, Mike.  And, Mike, did you like the interview we did with Rick Springfield?  Yeah, I thought it was kind of cool.  You know, I don't really know much about the guy.  Like I said, my wife's a big fan.  Yeah.  But I found out he was kind of cool, you know?  Yeah, your wife's a big fan like she was of Chocolat.  Right, right, right.  Can you hear me?  And that Annie gets her gun.

[02:30:30]  Talking about teens.  They always pop up.  I'm mentioned in a Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen song.  Yes.  In what way?  Well, we're going to play it.  In, like, some sick, perverted, twisted way.  What?  Did somebody make believe they're Mary-Kate and Ashley?  No, it's really what I'm saying.  This is Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.  You're mentioned in the song.  And I'm mentioned.  And I think it has some sexual innuendos.  I'm in.  Want to hear it? 
[02:31:00]  No.  They have, like, bugs crawling all over them and stuff.  Yeah.  Let me hear.  They're dirty girls.  Those annoying little things.  Annoying little things.  Yeah.  That grab your attention.  Grab your attention.  By crawling into places I wouldn't want to mention.  Nice.  They should be taught some manners.  Taught some manners.  By their height.

Check it out.  We're sitting here dating her for a month. 
[02:40:30]  I've been trying to get her into you guys.  I'm sitting here listening to it, and then we hear the girls come on,  and Rodney Dangerfield goes, hey, we're all going to get laid.  I start cracking up.  She says, that's it.  I am not dating a guy that thinks getting laid by four-year-olds is funny.  Come on, man.  She walked out, and I'm still cracking up.  I'm going to be crying later tonight.  They're 14.  And how many people will be singing this one in the middle of the night?  I swear it was this big. 
[02:41:00]  Hello, cutie pie.  Oh, man.  The best, though, is Bugs on My Baloney.  Bugs on My Baloney.  I said we listened to the song again, and it's bigger than an elephant. 
[02:41:30]  I'm thinking of my mouth.  What's that crack line?  Hmm?  Crackers?  Oh, something about bugs being in cracks.  In a cracker.  Yeah, you call it whatever you want, honey.  By the way, the Mary-Kate and Ashley song was sent in by Mick Kinks.  Thank you.  Bit of the day.  Thank you, Mick Kinks.  Oh, you've got to love it.  This sounds like a goddamn kindergarten school play. 
[02:42:00]  I'm thinking of my mouth.  There it was this big.  Butt tag.  Ouch.  Freaking 12.  I want to hear the song.  I want to hear the song.  It's catchy.  Stick that one in your head.  Yeah, let me just... 
[02:42:30]  The poor girls have bugs all over them.  Let me just whip it out and start cranking off a badge while the song plays.  Let me get my poster.  You made their song?  I got the poster in the back.  Aren't you happy?  Some bugs get all the luck.  Those annoying little things.  Annoying little things.  I'm sticking my mouth.  Grab your attention.  Grab your attention.  Just by crawling into places I wouldn't want to mention.  Vagina.  It looks like I'm a wreck. 
[02:43:00]  It's in the home.  Tons of manors.  Tons of manors.  Fight their heights.  You're right.  They shouldn't take what is in theirs.  And it's impolite to fight.  Yeah.  So what do you think of my tight pants? 
[02:43:30]  Vagina.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Vaginas. 
[02:44:00]  Hey, this is it.  Hootah.  Hootah.  Oh, my gosh, it's time to be.  Hey, this is it.  Hootah.  Hootah. 
[02:44:30]  Hootah.  You're wrong.  Where it was this big.  I'm thinking of my mouth.  Hootah.  Hootah.  Hootah.  Hootah.  Perfect.  Hootah.  Hootah.  Oh, my gosh, it's time to be.  Who's that, who's that, who's that? 
[02:45:00]  What is this?  Who's that?  Who's that?  Uh-oh.  I don't play.  I don't play. 
[02:45:30]  Rodney.  Yeah, we were going to do you guys earlier in the show.  If you're going to play the song again, you've got to do the instant replay.  Replay, replay, replay.  All right, Rodney.  That's it.  Bye.  That's too good.  That's going to be stuck in your head now.  Chris the Cop.  Yeah.  You guys are killing me.  Yeah.  Me and my partner, we are trying to drive to Staten Island. 
[02:46:00]  There's people laughing at us, just looking at us.  We've had a pullover in the 440.  They don't know what the hell's going on.  They're sitting in traffic, but they're just sitting laughing at us.  I can't drive like this.  All right, buddy.  You're killing me.  That's all, man.  It's horrible.  Woo.  That's a killer.  Dan.  Leave it to Opie and Anthony to make pre-teen sound hot.  You're close. 
[02:46:30]  Leave it to me now.  How are you?  And that bumblebee with fingers and an elephant.  Ow!  I swear it was this big.  Boo! 
[02:47:00]  Hey, Rich, what's up?  How you doing, honey?  We're having fun.  I got a screen name for sale.  Yeah.  Ants in my pants.  Ants in my pants.  A lot of screen names up for grabs today, man.  You got it.  Back to you, crumbones.  Ants in my pants.  It's a good thing.  The elephant.  Bugs in my bologna could be a good screen name, too.  It could be a good screen name, too.  Critters on my crack.  Critters on my crack.  Critters on my crack. 
[02:47:30]  Ow!  Everyone's saying we should just go to hell, go directly to hell.  Uncle John.  Hey, guys, I just heard an announcement.  They moved the meeting of the Pedophiles Anonymous back to 730,  so you guys can make it after the show.  Thank you all, good job.  You guys are sick.  All right, bye.  Critters on my crack.  It's going to be stuck in my head.  It's going to be like a zombie walking to the bathroom at 3 in the morning. 
[02:48:00]  It's the funniest thing.  When we get done with the show and we're in the office,  you'd be sitting at the computer going through an email for the day,  and like Rick will walk in, or I'll even come in and,  Critters on my crack.  Well, you know we're going to be doing that.  Matt, what's up?  I got my two-and-a-half-year-old here.  We're sitting here.  Wait a minute.  We're sitting right here at the Great River train station.  We need to remind me to come home.  And we're sitting there listening to the song,  and all you hear from the closet is,  I swear you, we're seeing this. 
[02:48:30]  Hey, we got to draw the line, man.  They got to be in double digits.  Have you seen this sig-pick yet?  No.  With me and the Olsen toys?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I've got my arms around them.  Yeah.  How about when you wake up 3 in the morning to take a leak,  and you're holding your junk?  Critters on my crack. 
[02:49:00]  I don't play it.  Where it was this big.  How are you?  Now we're having fun.  I love when that sounds out of place.  It's too good.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Very, very good brand-new song.  And thank you to McKink.  We will definitely be humming that one for quite a while, 
[02:49:30]  as will you people at home.  Critters on my crackers.  Big shoes on my egg.  I bet, you know something?  Those two have churned out more candy crap songs than anybody.  And there's got to be a few more out there with sexual innuendos.  Right.  That was innuendo?  I can't wait for Q's version of that one. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, it's only tricky.  It's a puffy version.  It's in my head.  It's a sacred salmon elephant.  I swear it was this big.  No problemo.  It's in my head.  It's a sacred salmon elephant.  Good morning.  I swear it was this big.  You son of a bitch. 
[02:50:30]  It's in my head.  It was sacred salmon elephant.  How are you?  I swear it was this big.  Hello, cutie pie.  It's in my head.  It's in my head.  You're a girl.  It was this big.  You're a filthy whore.  It's in my head.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It was a sacred salmon elephant. 
[02:51:00]  But then.  It was this big.  All right, and we've got to take a break.  Yeah, that's a good spot to do it.  Still more show to come.  Well, let's take a break.  All sex is the favorite for the young.  Believe it or not, you're listening to the number one afternoon drive show in New York City.  O.P. and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW. </pre>
