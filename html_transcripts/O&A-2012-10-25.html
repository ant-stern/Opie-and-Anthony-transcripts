<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts' characteristically profane and boisterous introduction, immediately followed by Opie’s messy mishap with iced coffee and cologne.  The conversation quickly pivoted to the New York Islanders' relocation to Brooklyn, sparking a debate about the team's legacy, the future of the Nassau Coliseum, and the anticipated cultural clash between Islander fans and Brooklyn hipsters.  Donald Trump's then-recent, bizarre YouTube presidential announcement dominated a significant portion of the show, with the hosts dissecting Trump's presentation style and the ensuing online ridicule.  Opie even issued a challenge to President Obama: release his college records, and Opie would donate $5 million to charity.  The hosts also reacted to Stephen Colbert’s outrageous response to Trump's announcement.

A listener audio contest segment followed, featuring a series of wildly inappropriate and often hilarious audio submissions.  Entries ranged from repetitive phrases about bloody children's underwear to elaborate, nonsensical songs.  One entry, a rendition of the Oompa Loompa song about Iraq being a "fatso," received particular attention.  The hosts’ commentary throughout this segment was punctuated by frequent laughter and interruptions.  The show then previewed upcoming guests: Amy Schumer, Brandon Steiner (sports memorabilia), and Tom Green.  Listener-submitted "F.U." messages were read, followed by a humorous account of a listener's 911 call about a supposedly stolen bus.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Donald Trump, the upcoming World Series, and updates on Stalker Patty's health.

A lengthy discussion ensued regarding a 20-year-old Brazilian woman who auctioned her virginity for $780,000 to a Japanese man named Natsu.  The hosts and Sam debated the implications of the event, the buyer's motivations, and the seller's dubious claim of donating the proceeds to charity.  The conversation, rife with crude and sexually explicit language, also explored the hosts' contrasting views on the desirability of virgins versus experienced women, and similarly discussed a male virgin who auctioned his virginity for $3,000. This segment also included an analysis of the viral popularity of "Gangnam Style" and a discussion of a Canadian radio station, "The Beat," and its on-air personalities.  A “Jacktober” segment followed, revisiting humorous past radio moments, mentioning deceased former colleagues like Tippy Tom and Ziggy, and a humorous exchange caused by a 30-second broadcast delay.

Sports memorabilia entrepreneur Brandon Steiner then called in.  He discussed his business, detailing the acquisition, storage, restoration, and sale of various sports-related items, ranging from dirt from Yankee Stadium to autographed memorabilia.  He shared anecdotes about obtaining signatures from famous athletes, highlighting the challenges and eccentricities involved. Steiner also mentioned his book, "You Gotta Have Balls," and his TV show, "Memories of the Game."  A caller revealed they’d inadvertently signed a Willie Mays baseball, adding to the segment's humor.  The segment concluded with a giveaway and a transition to a discussion about Jim Florentine's fantasy football show.  The conversation throughout this segment was punctuated by frequent profanity.

Amy Schumer, along with Tom Green and Jim Norton, joined the show next.  The show started with a quick discussion of a minor Twitter disagreement between Amy Schumer and Jim Norton.  A significant portion focused on Schumer's Comedy Central show, "Inside Amy Schumer," and the absurd demands from network Standards and Practices, with the hosts reading hilarious notes detailing required content alterations.  Schumer discussed her living situation, a rooftop party with Questlove DJing, and a recent Vanity Fair photoshoot.  The conversation also touched on Opie’s financial misconceptions about radio personalities, Jim Norton's stand-up schedule, Tom Green's experiences in Charlotte, and a lengthy, opinionated discussion on the JFK assassination, including Tom Green’s experiences at Richard Belzer's apartment.  The segment ended with Amy Schumer discussing her drinking habits.


Tom Green's solo guest appearance followed, beginning with a discussion of his comedy tour and anecdotes about opening acts and the challenges of solo travel.  A significant portion detailed shoplifting stories from the hosts and Green, including Green's confession about stealing a cassette and a spoon as a teenager.  Green also discussed a recent breakup, attributing it to his own shortcomings. One host discussed their on-again, off-again relationship, based on shared “hate” and drama.  The conversation touched upon the desire to have children, Amy Schumer’s pregnancy, and attitudes toward abortion.  A video of a bus driver delivering an uppercut to a female passenger was shown and discussed, including commentary on race and the hosts' amusement at the violence.  Green promoted his tour dates, and the hosts discussed their own shows and social media presence. The segment concluded with a retrospective on a viral video featuring Opie as a security guard, focusing on his method acting and observations on the actors' appearances.

The final segment featured Opie and Sam Roberts, with occasional interjections from an off-air Anthony Cumia.  The discussion centered on Opie's early career mistakes, his jewelry choices (including his engagement ring), and a running joke about his “tight ass.”  Anthony’s absence and apparent disengagement from the show, similar to E-Rock's, was a recurring theme.  The hosts promoted their online platforms and Joe DeRosa's video series, mentioning cameo appearances by E-Rock, Sam Roberts, and Danny Ross.  The show ended with Opie discussing attending a Jets game and speculating about the next day's broadcast, given the absence of Anthony and Jimmy. Tom Green was again mentioned as a potential guest.

[00:09:00]  figured it out because i i i i tweeted what i thought about the uh the announcement and then all day long  hey well why are you so quiet about the islanders moving to brooklyn i'm like i love look on my feed  i fucking tweeted it i was right there as soon as the announcement i'm like yay people really don't  check maybe even two tweets back on somebody before they well that's why i something that's  why i over tweet my videos and everything else because i know that yeah yeah i know most people 
[00:09:30]  when you tweet it the first time don't even see that fucking tweet yeah in their timeline yeah but  yeah the islanders are moving to brooklyn and i'm very excited because the the alternative was  they were going to move to uh some say kansas city kansas city at least the team stays in the  new york area yeah and brooklyn's not a bad place brooklyn well the best take i heard on this whole  situation yeah was that they'll probably have a packed uh barclays center every night because  hockey being not as popular as everything else the hipsters will flock to it because no one's 
[00:10:00]  who's into hockey because it's not fucking something also they're gonna discover hockey because  no one else likes it and then they're gonna they're gonna be the hockey crowd hipsters are  gonna be islander fans are gonna all be hipsters now yeah i saw a great logo someone mocked up it  it was a rework of the the logo it said the brooklyn hipsters yeah yeah the guy with the beard and  shit i've been to a lot of islanders uh games is it islanders islanders yeah islanders games and  uh i don't think they're gonna i don't think they're gonna fit in with the brooklyn crowd that's 
[00:10:30]  gonna be a strange mix gonna scare some of the people i think the people are gonna be scared  that usually see the islanders the people that just go out to nassau county right and fucking  uh you know suffolk and nassau county people they're gonna go like oh boy we gotta go to  brooklyn honey yeah oh geez you know it's there oh boy i've been a new yorker uh i'm truly a new  yorker now but my roots are you know on long island sure and for the islanders to blow it and not be  able to figure out how to keep that team on long island is ridiculous yeah yeah but with that said i'm 
[00:11:00]  i'm glad that they're at least going to be in the area but how how do they not figure that out  they had a shitty fucking coliseum for many many many years people started making fun of the  coliseum 15 years ago it's easily 15 years ago and in the last 10 to 15 years they couldn't figure  out how to keep that team happy what are they going to do with the coliseum they'll probably  fucking just uh tear it down plow it under they're not gonna be able to uh without the islanders they're  not gonna be able to keep it i mean what else are they going to put there fucking charlie daniels 
[00:11:30]  is coming back to long island there's just not enough concerts i don't think to keep the thing  going no they'll just do brooklyn and other places yeah you do brooklyn you do fucking the  garden shit like that right why would you go out to nassau county it's a terrible venue it's horrible  awful it's just in the middle of nowhere and huh so the parking is good but oh god it's terrible  he's the parking's terrible parking everything about that coliseum the parking actually is in bed  really yeah that's why i didn't get it isn't the parking lot like the moon it's huge the surface of 
[00:12:00]  the moon though it's like big fucking potholes in there no they paved it over one year after i  bitched it was i was very suspicious that uh the i started bitching about look at least you could do  is uh put the lines back in where you know where you're supposed to park and suspiciously a few  months later that was done oh no i forgot that they they said that one of the reasons that they  moved was uh because you know the the coliseum was kind of falling apart and they're now the voters  of nassau county uh voted against like a 400 million dollar yeah stupid anthony voted against 
[00:12:30]  it but hang on but why are the taxpayers on the hooks i can't remember how come why were they  responsible for that renovation they weren't that's why it went to a vote and everybody voted and said  fuck you we're not paying for it yeah i don't know i honestly don't know the ins and outs but i mean  it happens in other cities where they get new arenas and and the and the taxpayers pay that should  have been in this case they just didn't want it they could have fucking sold bonds or whatever the  fuck they needed to do to raise the money aside from raising taxes from taxpayer money to throw  that in but that's what i mean by they couldn't they just couldn't figure it out in the end 
[00:13:00]  i mean they should have had a plan fucking b after that vote went sour for them yeah so now i mean what  the fuck how many dumb white trash carnivals in the parking lot can they run uh that's going to  make them money it's a shithole so i without the islanders i really don't see how that could survive  why would you why would you revamp it with no sports teams in there so now they're in a position  where it's like oh we're not going to build it up we don't even have a sports team and mark and and i 
[00:13:30]  i'm saying it here first man that the islanders supposedly get to move i say supposedly get to  move in 2015 they move sooner they break their fucking lease you think so knowing they could be  playing in a uh state-of-the-art arena immediately yeah they will figure it out imagine how nice it would  be for a team all of a sudden play you look up and there's just a brand new nice fucking arena  you're playing in oh that's why you know i was gonna say bittersweet but that's stupid i hate  when people say bittersweet because you know it would have been nice if they stayed actually on 
[00:14:00]  i mean it is technically the island brooklyn is technically part of long island yeah but it's like  but it's it's now you're talking it's a city borough obviously no one no one from uh brooklyn or  queens it's like yeah i'm from the long island no no of course not yeah yeah i'm from long  island of course not but i i bet you the team somehow tries to figure out how to break their  lease and move on immediately yeah if they ever start playing hockey again yeah there's a pretty  bad lockdown happening right now i hear what they're going to do at the coliseum is they're  going to keep it there and use it as a haunted house once a year that'd be huge but what's going 
[00:14:30]  to happen is you're going to walk in the lights have to remain on and what they're going to do is  just erect a giant ghost in the middle of the coliseum you just walk in and look at it that's  terrible yeah and the sound effect boo i thought it was going to be tunnels and things where you  weave around in a huge coliseum jimmy's doing ted without the ted voice that's really strange idea  i just have a i just have a haunted house craving lately so just squeezing it in everywhere do you  want to go into haunted house very much i just want to go haunted house haunted houses are all right 
[00:15:00]  we used to go to spooky world spooky world up there in massachusetts it was kind of funny watching  people get all scared and shit yeah chasing you around with chainsaws until they recognize you  and go hey man big fan that was yeah that's where it started sucking when we first went there it was  all cool can scare me please it's fun and then we started going to spooky world like a couple of  years into it and uh yeah that truly happened work there i was starting to go 
[00:15:30]  just don't take me out of this i'm having fun yeah really man so the islanders uh announcement  was big but not the biggest announcement yesterday certainly no no no fucking donald trump  oh god that was great and we love yeah sure he is embarrassing that was his face oh and we and  and we get along with his son we like his son but but he he donald trump's a circus act what it 
[00:16:00]  really happened to this i mean that announcement he's always been kind of like like this guy but now  it's an extreme version of uh the original donald trump yeah he's a circus act everyone speculated  that this announcement was going to be maybe about some kind of divorce that was being filed something  that would change the entire election yeah yeah some type of surprise there's rumors of divorce papers  yeah the divorce thing and then um just anything it it turned out to be yeah a circus thing a fucking 
[00:16:30]  pt barnum uh thing that that oh uh he has against obama it's a morning zoo bit yeah oh god it's kind  of a morning zoo bit i'm the fugitive you're fired i'm the fugitive and then he's so pompous like i mean  he's getting killed for this announcement oh he really is oh twitter was brutal and then he's got a tweet  out there going oh the support has been overwhelmingly positive yeah i read a few replies people are like 
[00:17:00]  oh do you uh give me your other account then yeah because i'm reading the one that is not supportive  yeah yeah and you know obama uh absolutely should be you know showing us all his records everything if  you're the president of the united states i'd like to know a little something something about you yes  of course yeah but obama's not going to placate to donald trump you look like a fool yeah every  single every single grade they ever got and i mean romney him any of these guys if you're going to be 
[00:17:30]  you're going to run the free world i should have access to everything in your fucking life yeah if  you can make that many decisions that affect me yep every grade you ever got i should be able to see  everywhere you ever traveled i should be able to see we have a very vague knowledge of uh obama by the  way like every other president you could look at a biography of every other president you really  do have an indication of every year of their life what they did where they were um their schooling 
[00:18:00]  military careers whatever it is like you can't look back and go all right at 18 what was he doing  at 23 what was he doing like with obama it's this vagary of this mysterious world traveling with  various parental units and guardians and where was he when and we certainly know odd but for for trump  to do this oh it's ridiculous you want to play the announcement most people most people uh heard 
[00:18:30]  this already right but let's let's roll through it so it was oh sorry sorry so it was a youtube video  that yeah that of course that went live i mean it was pre-recorded but went live on uh on his twitter  at 12 noon yesterday and i was i was right there man for the big announcement the least transparent  president in the history of this country there's never been anything like it we know very little about  our president i'm very honored to have gotten him to release his long form birth certificate 
[00:19:00]  birth certificate or whatever it may be now many many people pause real quick because something's  enraging me his hands yes i don't like his hands it looks like a bouncing ball in a music video  they're perfectly equidistant and going in and out in a robotic fashion yes he's accenting certain  words and you can uh you can hear his like cufflinks or whatever it is like hitting the table every  time he puts his arms down so it's like tick tick tick tick and he puts them out in a weird jazz 
[00:19:30]  hands fashion ah very very uncomfortable yes serious questions i have a deal for the president  a deal that i don't believe he can refuse well he's going to hope he doesn't he's not even gonna  fucking if barack obama opens up and gives his college records and applications and if he  gives his passport applications and records i will give to a charity of his choice inner city 
[00:20:00]  children in chicago oh american cancer society aids research anything he wants a check immediately  for five million dollars damn this is like dr evil within five million dollars releases all of the  records so stated so stated he'll be doing a great service this is one of the plot lines for batman if 
[00:20:30]  he releases these records it will end the question and indeed the anger of many americans it's like  that local car salesman yeah five thousand dollars will become for obama's records so  all he has to do to get five million dollars for a charity or charity it's a radio it's a gag we've  done this dumb get his colleges monty trump that's a good one obama what do you do you have a paper 
[00:21:00]  clip do you have a paper clip in your bag uh show us uh your your passport application do you have  it in there i think he does he's looking for it he's dressed as the president that's his costume  let's make a deal yeah this guy donald trump dude this guy is is uh he comes off as a buffoon  in this what is he doing i i'm i'm relieved today because uh it's obviously a big romney guy and i 
[00:21:30]  thought you might uh you might have been all in with the donald trump i'm so relieved you're not  god no i wasn't sure i wasn't sure i'm on on the way in today i'm like i don't know i haven't talked  to anthony i wonder how he feels about this ridiculous donald trump announcement the fact  that even uh hannity was was entertaining he was a little bit his show was i was looking i was  watching uh hannity and just going like oh come on sean sean what are you doing i mean he kind of did  kind of to his credit little tongue and cheeky he was but he was saying he goes you know what it's 
[00:22:00]  a good deal uh five million dollars if you want to help out and stuff he wasn't he wasn't really  jumping on it but even to entertain it at all is silly but presidents don't even negotiate with  terrorists well so why is it why would he negotiate it's kind of a weird little negotiation thing yeah  fucking donald trump yeah you know what a clown obama would look like if if he released something  like that just to get a check it'd be embarrassing it'd be like saying if he wears a uh if he wears 
[00:22:30]  like a felt pimp suit yeah i'll send a thousand dollars that would be great terrible uh donald trump  thinks uh you know it's great and the way he prepped feedback announcement like it was going to be this  big exposing moment this fucking thing he was going to hold it up and be here it is  the fucking form that says he was born in the north pole i got tricked because i i thought it was  going to be one of these clinton things you know yeah yeah yeah when we first found out that clinton 
[00:23:00]  was getting blowjobs in the line house i got tricked for a little bit i thought holy fuck i think  donald trump really has i have a cummy dress right right here i have a photo of obama wearing white  after labor day i will release it i'm gonna have a gentleman from gurney speak right now  oh my god what dreck it's drivel you know if he if he if he said this would have been a better one 
[00:23:30]  if he releases these records i will take this pink tie and hang myself at the end of this video  that's an offer that everybody would like to see him take it's a win-win i'll fire myself  i was out of i was out of touch yesterday a little bit did uh the news uh shows do anything on this  obviously they did but uh how much coverage did they have on it well and were they mocking him or  what was the whole feel out there uh they told me about how you know what i really didn't see a lot 
[00:24:00]  of news coverage on it yeah i mean probably some of the local goofy things were doing it but  as far as uh cnn even fox things like that aside from you know like hannity i got greta didn't even  talk about it greta greta i don't think um i'm not sure about any of the other shows yeah okay i was  flipping around last night it's flipping around let's uh play the rest of this the big donald trump  announcement for a charity or charities of his choice is get his colleges to immediately give 
[00:24:30]  his applications and records and also to release his passport records when he does that to my  satisfaction if it's complete this check is delivered immediately a lot of people will be  very very very happy to see this happen frankly it's a check that i very much want to write 
[00:25:00]  i absolutely would be the most happy of all if i did as opposed to the happiest  i'm gonna sit in front of this guy in a meeting one caveat the records must be given by october 31st  at five o'clock in the afternoon mr president not only will i be happy and by the way totally  satisfied but the american people will be happy and you know what those charities will be very very 
[00:25:30]  happy thank you mr president it must be done by october 31st where i will come out in full clown  makeup as i should be wearing in this video i will have a big red nose on and i will be acting  like a clown in a video that is embarrassing that's embarrassing and he's addressing the president  yeah the president like like like not not hey everybody this is my my little thing for the president  he's like mr president i'm gonna make a video and just talk into the camera mr president yeah 
[00:26:00]  you know how many of those are gonna be out today probably oh god exactly yeah there's gonna be a few  of those mr president indeed yeah it's a it's definitely a plot line from like a batman movie  it is it's stupid he's a super villain where like the joker takes over the mayor's office right  he's a super villain puts out a message to batman uh well uh obama just happened to be on leno last  night and uh he certainly commented about this because you know i'll say that's smart timing by trump 
[00:26:30]  that's why he did it that day because he knew he was taping leno right that's not a mistake and you  know leno was going to ask him of course now i gotta ask you about this this what what's this  thing with trump and you i don't he's it's like me and letterman what has he got against you  this all dates back to uh when we were growing up together in kenya yeah  and uh  gotta give me i gotta give you that one i gotta give you that one 
[00:27:00]  we we had you know constant run-ins on the soccer field  yeah yeah he wasn't very good and yeah resented it yeah yeah yeah have you when we finally moved  to america i thought it'd be over yeah yeah no no have you have you met him i know you're in this  been in the same room i saw you the car's money have you met him i i haven't actually you haven't  actually met him no okay yeah obama sounding a little looser there yeah you got it stiff uh 
[00:27:30]  haven't we when we were growing up in kenya and my uh drunken womanizing father hit him with our car  and uh donald never lived it down  and then uh you got the uh the trump on piers morgan yesterday oh no oh god there's nothing  wrong with his applications if everything's fine why wouldn't he do it to pick up five million  dollars for a charity why wouldn't he that i think that would be a terrible thing all right can you 
[00:28:00]  pause this to no i wish bill gates would come out and see if donald trump shows  but how about this i'll give 10 million dollars to a charity if you just stand there take a video  of yourself waving with your dick out yeah do you think he'd do it no i don't of course of course you  wouldn't do it in order to pick up five million dollars i think that would be outrageous 
[00:28:30]  he would say that it's just a publicity stunt for you it's not a publicity stunt what difference i'm not  looking to pay five million dollars i mean frankly i have other things i have my own charities that i  contribute to i don't have to pay five million dollars to a charity of his choice it's not a publicity stunt  it's a it's a serious very serious offer essentially where a charity is the beneficiary a great charity and  a charity of his choice now if everything is fine with those applications why wouldn't he do it now 
[00:29:00]  he'll poo poo it he'll say forget it i don't want to do this i don't know he won't acknowledge it  dummy all this nonsense has nothing to do with me here's five million dollars a tremendous amount of  money going to a charity of his just all he has to do is show some paper we get it we get it we get  the offer you're not picking up steam with this one no no it's he's like oh fuck i thought it was  gonna get more heat he's done that's embarrassing this is a just a dumb fucking gimmick wow that was

[00:37:30]  frowning  frowning  he's not very happy  maybe he's not  maybe he's not paying attention  maybe  he's been known to not pay attention  you know what we're talking about right now  nope not at all  i'll tell you  we are the elephants  not shaving  shaving  what an unshaven mess you are  fix that face  what happened  he rocks  immediately  you know  we could do some jingles 
[00:38:00]  oh yeah  jimmy  sang us into jingles  that's the jingles  well we haven't done  any of the entries  in the O&A audio contest  in a couple days  no  we got a bunch of them  i'm still getting a bunch too  i got  good  a lot more where that came from  i think we got another couple weeks  to get your entries in  november 9th  wow good  is the last day  and then we can start figuring this shit out  yeah i mean we're slowly  you know  compiling  a list of the ones  that you guys have liked the most  yeah  so  we should highlight those again 
[00:38:30]  yeah i mean  the best of the best  but today we're going to do new entries  we got one from  i put a couple that i don't think are really  you know  the  oh i see  in big letters  not good  however they do make me chuckle  but there is just something about them  that's also just so terrible  all right  uh we got brad showers  here's his entry  in the ona jingle  slash audio contest  i i was howling  and everyone was howling  eric were you howling 
[00:39:00]  eric were you howling  eric were you howling  fucking howling  eric were you howling  eric were you howling  i was howling  and everyone was howling  eric were you howling  eric were you howling  eric were you howling  I was fucking howling.  E-Rock, were you howling?  E-Rock, were you howling?  Laughing my ass off.  I was howling.  I was howling.  Fucking howling.  I got a tree on my house. 
[00:39:30]  All right.  That's cheating.  That's cheating.  Is that just a cheap laugh?  Yeah, that's cheating.  That's like saying, how are you doing, Cleveland?  That's cheating at the end there.  Back me up, ladies.  Yeah, he knew that would get a laugh.  The howling thing.  That's kind of funny.  The worst part of that, I had no idea that was one of my crutches.  I know most of my crutches, so relax.  Those are the worst ones that you just don't know.  When that video hit YouTube, I'm like, holy fuck, I say that a lot?  I had no idea. 
[00:40:00]  You want another entry?  Yes.  Cameron Albergo, it looks like.  Penis is what boys have down in front.  Penis is the word though it seems blunt.  All boys have a penis, so no matter what you've heard, remember the penis is the proper word.  Bulma is what girls have down below.  Even though most people call it vagina, and some children call it the chicken.  Bulma, when she's naked, it will show.  All girls have a bulma, so no matter what you've heard, remember the proper word. 
[00:40:30]  Does it get better than that?  Yeah, you know, he just turned it into a song.  Faster and kind of...  No, but that's not him singing.  The guitar.  Well, no, it's not him singing, but the music.  That stinks.  We don't have cop rebelling on that.  Sometimes we differ.  You're listening to that.  You've said that it sucks.  I'm not sure that's original.  It's not original.  Oh, really?  I got it.  It sucks.  All right, we'll move on to the next one.  This is my thin Jewish wife.  She abandoned her family.  Sorry, Travis.  Didn't even know. 
[00:41:00]  We'll move on to Dan Heaton.  Bloody child's underpants.  Bloody child's underpants.  Bloody children's underpants.  There's no music there.  No, that's good.  What the fuck?  Let me hear that one more time.  I wasn't ready for it.  Bloody child's underpants.  Bloody child's underpants.  Bloody children's underpants.  Yeah.  We'll be an Anthony show. 
[00:41:30]  Jesus.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  That's good.  That's a perfect promo, though.  It really is.  It says it all.  Fernando Vieira.  ONA's got the best shock jocks.  Jess is going to leave Sam for a bigger cut.  You rocks fat?  Oh, wow.  Was that one of the good ones, Travis, that you picked?  There's just so many bad ones.  So many like that, right?  You didn't label that as not good, sir.  No, but listen.  There's just so many bad ones that when something like that comes out, I'm like, okay. 
[00:42:00]  Do you realize you could just grab your phone, go like, blah, blah, blah, and email it?  Do you realize that that's what 90% of the people are doing?  Yes.  The old days, you had to put it on tape.  It had to be some type of sound adjustments made.  And then you had to physically mail it in?  Let's see how Ted M does here.  Ooh.  Opie, Jimmy, and Anthony, and loves young pussy, and he rocks a big fat ass. 
[00:42:30]  Opie, Jimmy, and Anthony, Jimmy loves Chinese, and Detroit is a hipster douchebag.  Dishbag and dope is a brother man.  Opie, Jimmy, and I ain't.  Oh, God.  Oh, that's so bad.  He just took some fucking...  NFL music, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's all right.  Yeah.  Oh, we are the dinosaurs. 
[00:43:00]  Marching.  Did he do consuming yet?  No.  What do you think?  Oh, yeah, he consumes.  We.  We are the elephants consuming, consuming.  I had one stuck in my head.  Elephants.  He rock sure is fat.  Here's Josh Howell.  Today's entry is for the ONAA Audio Contest.  With special guests.  Sirius XM presents The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:43:30]  Starring Opie.  This is going to be fun for everyone.  Anthony.  Your mother's a slut.  And I banged her.  And Jim North.  If you head towards your goal, your goals will meet you halfway.  With special guests.  Chip Chipperson.  What's that?  Uncle Paul.  Let me kiss your tummy.  Josh Goodnaturedly.  Ha ha, come here.  No, let me tickle you.  Edgar.  Lick my teeth.  Janine.  Janine Ian Jim.  I'm going to try to put it in the backside. 
[00:44:00]  Ted Shecklin.  I'm dark left.  Light-eyed Jim.  Frank the Frowner.  I don't care.  Eugene.  Don't dress the garden.  Jelly.  I'm suddenly.  Oh, come on.  Future Jim.  Literal Jim.  Boardroom Jim.  Ramone.  Valley Jim.  Cry-fighting Jim.  Smooth Jesse Jim.  Swedish Jim.  Jimsy.  Coach Jimmy.  Ah, fuck it.  This show's getting ridiculous.  That's pretty funny.  The guy had a good gimmick there.  Very good.  It just took off.  But he's a lot of Jimmy characters. 
[00:44:30]  But he forgot the most popular one.  Oh.  Smiling Jim.  Oh.  Hi.  Welcome to the show.  I just liked how catchy it was.  That one's going to get stuck in my head all day.  Oh, yeah, yeah, exactly.  I know.  It could have been a jingle.  It's a jingle.  It should be a jingle.  A jingle should have, like, a tempo to it.  No, I don't think, no.  They've all pointed out that it wasn't part of the rules.  Yeah, it's true.  How about something jingly?  Like, you know, radio, radio.  That's good.  I had fucking, I was watching Boardwalk Empire the other night, and something got stuck in 
[00:45:00]  my head where I was just, I sung a song about the Blarney Stone to myself, and it was fucking,  I'm like, oh, do I have to kill them with this?  No.  But it went away the next day.  Oh, you can't remember the Blarney Stone song that you had?  It was, it just hit me.  It was like a two-verse, like a two-line song.  Something about Blarney Stone, Blarney, it was terrible.  And it was fucking, it was not from anything, and I just, oh, you're, consider yourselves  lucky.  Coin, consider yourself lucky. 
[00:45:30]  It just popped in your head?  Oh, it was awful.  It was from nowhere.  It stunk.  You guys want to hear a not good one?  Oh, yeah.  And that's how we start.  All right.  Now we got to, uh, turn a little homosexual.  Old white men.  Old mother hocker.  You're going to take all the licks you can get.  It's not great, but it's not as bad as I thought it would be.  These are huge.  Suck the big one. 
[00:46:00]  This one, man, I felt my throat get sore.  You know this is not normal, right?  And here it is.  It is upon me.  I just, my body just collapses afterwards.  My immunities are down.  I didn't know he was gay.  Satellite's gone.  What the fuck, psychopath?  Put this together.  What is he doing?  It's like Ron and Fez.  What is he doing?  I don't know.  That one scares me. 
[00:46:30]  That is scary.  There's people out there like that.  I think sometimes people, like, they string stuff together and, like, in their own heads.  Like, it's a conversation and it makes sense in the context of their brains.  But then the second it's outside of yourself, it's fucking gone.  I mean, there's a part in there where you thought it was over.  It's just, like, three seconds of silence.  Yeah, yeah.  There's no rhyme or reason to that one.  Why would you hand that in?  So far, that's in the lead.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the winner.  Well, it's going to win for editing anyway.  Yeah, it's great.  We'll give an editing award out.  Good one.  And finally, this is the last one for now. 
[00:47:00]  Maybe we'll get some other ones for later in the show.  Is this one not good?  I don't know.  Yeah, it's labeled not good.  There's a line in here that made me really laugh.  But overall, I don't think it's good.  I don't like the look of it.  Iraq is a fatso.  Iraq is a fatso.  Iraq is a fatso.  Iraq is a fatso.  Iraq is a fatso.  Oompa, loompa, doompa-dee-do.  XM Sirius Radio.  Oompa, loompa, doompa-dee-dee. 
[00:47:30]  Mornings with Opie and Anthony.  Iraq is a fatso.  Iraq is a fatso.  Iraq is a fatso.  What do you get between six and ten?  Something before Sam's shit show begins.  But it's repulsed and revolting and wrong.  Jamie has different voices all day long.  Yeah.  Iraq is a fatso.  Iraq is a fatso.  This is terrible.  Iraq is a fatso. 
[00:48:00]  Oompa, loompa, doompa-dee-do.  All right.  Iraq looks like honey boo-boo.  If you're not a fan, then have a nice day.  Opie and Anthony are here.  To stay.  That was the line, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  They call it like Iraq's in the chocolate factories.  Or something.  Oh.  Iraq is honey boo-boo.  Wow.  The honey boo-boo line got me, but the rest of it is just.  That's right.  I didn't mind the tempo, too.  That's shit. 
[00:48:30]  Iraq is a fatso.  Iraq is a fatso.  Well, none of those are going to make the best of you.  That was terrible.  Not even the first one?  Which one was the first one?  That was awful.  I forget, but you guys laughed.  I've heard so many.  Oh, the howling one?  Yeah.  That might be able to make the disc for now.  But it wasn't a jingle.  It's just a mix.  That one might be able to move on to the next round.  All right.  Oh, God.  All right.  So what do we do?  It's $2,000 courtesy of Steven Singer.  Yeah.  IHateStevenSinger.com.

[00:49:30]  I leave right after the show to go to Philly tonight.  I believe the Late Show might be sold out.  There was less than 20 tickets as of yesterday.  So I think the Sunday show this weekend is the only one with availability at the Helium in Philly.  Once again, Philly just comes through as a fucking great market.  They're animals.  They're fucking great for this show.  Fucking animals.  Looking forward to it.  Thank you.  You rock.  Oh, we are the dinosaurs marching, marching.  We are the dinosaurs. 
[00:50:00]  What do you think of that?  We are the dinosaurs marching, marching.  We are the dinosaurs.  We make the earth flat.  We make the earth flat.  The O'Brien 3 channel.  Who taught you how to do this stuff?  You, all right?  I learned it by watching you.  On Sirius XM.  I was driving home and I was behind a bus.  You know, like the bus has an automatic sign.  9-1-1, call police.  I call 9-1-1.  9-1-1, what is the emergency? 
[00:50:30]  I'm on 10th Avenue northbound and I'm behind a bus and the sign says call 9-1-1.  I thought it was a stolen bus.  I didn't know it was happening.  There could have been hostages.  I mean, we all saw that Keanu Reeves movie.  I'm on the phone with a 9-1-1.  I'm this fucking dummy.  I said, where are you now?  I said, I'm northbound on 47th Street on 10th Avenue.  Okay, you're on.  Now, where are you now?  I said, 48th Street.  Where are you now?  49th Street.  And you said, it's heading which way, sir?  Northbound.  The only way you can go on 10th Avenue.  I was so irritated with these dummies.  So we make the left on 57th Street.  We go down to 11th Avenue. 
[00:51:00]  I go, look, he's making the left on 11th Avenue.  It's a yellow light, so the bus slows down and then shoots through the light and leaves me at the red light.  I knew that the bus did that on purpose.  I'm like, this guy knows I'm behind him.  Now we're going southbound again.  So I called back.  No, there's an emergency.  So I just called and no one is doing anything.  I'm following a stolen bus, I think.  No one is doing it.  How long does it take to get a squad car on fucking 11th Avenue?  So I pull up next to it and it's really dark on the bus.  And I just see some, there's a black dude.  I'm on the phone.  I'm like, I'm looking at the guy.  And he's just a black dude, but he's not dressed like a bus driver.  And I know that he's stealing this bus. 
[00:51:30]  I'm northbound now and he's behind me.  And he's like, what street?  I'm like, I was passing 40th Street.  The woman was like, where was he before?  10th and 11th, but then he came down 11th and now we went up 10th.  He's probably going to turn it off.  You guys are going to lose him.  So you keep saying 10th and 11th, but 10th and 11th are on parallel.  What street and 11th?  I know, he was on 10th and then he went down 11th.  So then I was just like, fuck this shit.  And I drive away and he pulls away slowly and starts to drive.  And I'm like, you know what?  Forget it.  You know what?  He just turned it off.  He just turned it off.  Okay.  We lost him and he probably turned into the bus depot. 
[00:52:00]  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s.  Fuck you.

No, Carol Lyons, October 25th to the 28th.  Which is tonight through Sunday.  So he'll be in a little later.  World Series, Giants beat the Tigers 8-3 to take a one-zip lead. 
[00:55:30]  Game two tonight.  I love not having the pressure of having to root for a team.  You just fucking bail totally, huh?  No, you go through that, you know, beginning, right after your team loses, you just go through  kind of like, ah, fuck, you know, it would have been cool, eh, it would have been nice  to be able to go to some games and stuff, playoff games and shit like that, and a World  Series game.  But then it just gets like, you hear like, there was a game last night, I didn't even 
[00:56:00]  pay attention, and then, you know, you hear that the Giants won, and you just think,  ah, I'm so glad I don't have to worry about that.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, once it's all over, you're just like, ah, good.  Just let me know when it's game seven.  That's it, huh?  Yeah, it's fixed every year.  I'll watch game seven.  That'll be fun.  Did it go seven games last year?  What do they have?  Hmm?  The Giants, yeah.  Yeah, they kicked Verlander's ass, right? 
[00:56:30]  Verlander.  Verlander's one.  Yes, the 2011 World Series did go seven games.  See?  It's all fixed.  So, let me know when game seven is.  I'll watch that.  Is Verlander that ugly chick?  What do you mean?  Is that the pitcher?  Yeah, he's the fucking...  Is that ugly girl?  He's the pitches.  He wasn't supposed to get rocked like he did last night.  No?  I know that much.  Fuck yeah.  I'm pushing for the Tigers, too.  Gotta push for the Tigers.  Unlike politicians, I'll fucking tell you who I want to win. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, no, it's Lincum.  Lincum.  Lincum?  Lincum.  Who's that?  Lincum.  The pitcher is the ugly chick.  No.  Yeah.  So, the Donald Trump announcement was a big deal yesterday, and Stephen Colbert had his own fucking...  Stephen Colbert.  Or...  Stephen Colbert.  Colbert.  I am so moved by this generous offer, that I have an offer of my own, right over here. 
[00:57:30]  Mr. Trump, I will write you a check for $1 million from Colbert Super PAC, you know I've got it,  to the charity of your choice.  Anything.  Save the children, feed the children, put the children on Child Apprentice, whatever.  $1 million actual dollars, if you will let me dip my balls in your mouth. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, fuck, is that good?  Why do they still make believe that Jon Stewart is the big guy over there?  I don't know.  I want to know the answer to that.  Jon Stewart does a very good job, don't get me wrong.  Fucking hilarious.  But Colbert fucking destroys...  He just nails it every time.  On a daily basis.  Perfect angle on things.  And also made Jon Stewart change his whole way of doing things. 
[00:58:30]  Stewart's gotten, I think, more like, actually, like, he interviews the president.  He's the real guy.  Well, that's what I'm trying to say.  Yeah, he's got almost a little bit more of a...  They're still trying to make everyone think he's the main guy over there, when it might  be someone a little more talented right there in the lineup.  Colbert, that whole character, that whole right-wing talk show guy, political talk show guy,  it's hilarious.  If you will let me dip my balls in your mouth.  One million. 
[00:59:00]  But, but, but, this dipping, and I hope you're listening very carefully, Mr. Trump, this  dipping has to be to my, and more importantly, my balls' satisfaction.  Okay?  One caveat.  One caveat.  My balls must be in your mouth no later than 5 p.m. October 31st. 
[00:59:30]  Okay?  My balls have a thing that night.  Now, nothing, nothing would make me happier than to write this check.  And nothing would make America happier than have something going into your mouth instead  of coming out of it.  Tell me, let's do this for the kids.  There you go.  Why wouldn't Donald Trump do that? 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, come on, Donald.  That's, that's easy money.  Easy money.  Easy money for one of your charities.  Charity gets help, and you just gotta have, uh, Colbert's balls in your mouth for a little  bit.  He's fucking easy.  He's the shit, man.  Good one.  A good one.  Yeah.  We have Jacktober just sitting here.  Jacktober.  Oh, we did the fucking stupid fugitive yesterday.  Oh, yeah, that kind of took the fucking energy out of the bit, didn't it?  It's terrible.  But we also have a virgin who sold- 
[01:00:30]  Virgin.  She sold, uh, her virginity.  I make 15 cents off of it.  Holy fuck.  Can we do this with Stalker Patty?  I don't know.  I found- I have a lump of my thyroid.  I have to have it checked out.  Is that real?  Yeah, she tweeted that.  Oh, my God.  I have a lumpy thyroid.  Ugh.  Ew.  How old is she now?  I don't know.  What is she?  She hasn't been around in a while that probably the new listeners don't even know who she is. 
[01:01:00]  Stalker Patty, our virgin friend that we met, uh, probably-  Virgin.  She's probably, I don't even want to know.  I think 15 years ago at this point.  It's gotta be.  She's gotta be 54 or 5.  Still a virgin?  I think older than that.  Really?  Maybe.  Really?  Really?  It seems like we were saying she was a 50-year-old virgin, like, years ago.  How old is she, uh, Iraq?  I think Danny's right.  Yeah.  It's around 54 or 55.  Wow.  I thought she was older.  She's 54, 55, and she's still a virgin? 
[01:01:30]  Still?  Of course she is.  Still?  Still waiting for that special person?  There's no one that she would fuck.  I'm waiting for something special to-  Like, what?  The Grim Reaper?  Yeah, get her on the phone.  Where has she been?  We could hear about her fucking thyroid tumor.  Ugh.  What the fuck?  If your thigh-  Where is your thyroid?  It's like in your neck.  It is.  That's why they feel it to see if there's any lumps on it.  Yeah.  There's all kinds of shit going on in your neck.  Glans and fucking things.  A lot of wiring. 
[01:02:00]  There's just a lot of wiring in that area.  Between the body and head?  There's a lot going through that conduit.  Yep.  Too much.  I think it was Don Gavin, a Boston comic who I saw a clip of, do a very funny line about  when you got-  I think it was him.  Where if you got something wrong with you, like if you feel something, you're like, oh  my god, and you immediately check the other side to see if it's there, too.  To see if it matches.  And then you're like, oh god, it's there.  Thank god.  All right, there's two.  A lump on both sides.  How about you got double fucking death in your neck?  Yeah, imagine.  It's double death.  And you think it's okay. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  So we got this virgin.  She auctioned off her virginity.  And a Japanese man wins.  Of course.  God bless her.  It won't even hurt.  She'll still be a virgin.  She'll do it twice.  She's going to redo the contest after.  Very good.  What was the deal?  How old a gal?  She's 20.  Well, you got a Japanese man.  He pays $780,000 for the virginity of a 20-year-old Brazilian woman. 
[01:03:00]  $780,000.  You know how-  That's 200 years old in any other country.  It could be a virgin.  Is that her?  Was that her?  Let me see.  Let's see.  Wow.  Wow.  Let's see.  Really?  Where is she from?  Brazil?  That's-  Come on.  She's a virgin?  She's a virgin.  Come on now.  Come on.  I want to make it up to a virgin girl.  Stick a dick inside.  Buy virginity for 600 billion yen. 
[01:03:30]  Which is 8.50 cents.  No, the exchange rate for their-  This broad's all right.  Yeah, but I mean, if you're spending that kind of money on some-  Well, it's like, wouldn't you rather spend it on someone who knows how to touch your dick?  Like, she has no idea what to do.  That's the whole gimmick for that guy.  That's the turn-on.  Which I don't comprehend.  If a virgin, I want nothing to do with you.  That's the turn-on.  Man, how many broads could he get for $780,000, though? 
[01:04:00]  Jesus Christ.  $780,000, probably.  Yeah.  Probably got two.  Huh?  Oh.  She make the broad, broad all over my sheet.  All over sheet.  My broad.  Go ahead, say it.  Yeah.  Sheet.  Arthur, you're going with a Japanese flag joke.  Oh, yes.  Make my sheet look like all the Japanese flag.  I'm very proud of a rising sun all over every white thing in my house. 
[01:04:30]  All the rice paper walls on my house look like a Japanese flag.  She has much broad from Hava China.  Broken Heyman.  This Brazilian broad is going to use the money for a charity.  She's going to use it for a housing project.  What?  Doesn't she need the money?  Charity. 
[01:05:00]  A man called Natsu.  Natsu.  Natsu.  From Japan, fended off strong competition from American bidders.  Jack Miller and Jack Wright.  And a big spender from India to secure a date with the 20-year-old lady.  And it's...  Katarina is her name, I guess?  Katarina, yeah.  It's a lock?  She's definitely got a fucking fuck, right?  Mm-hmm.  Man.  Uh, she will use the cash to build homes for poverty-stricken families. 
[01:05:30]  Well, that's what, I guess, your article says here.  Ah.  It's different?  Yeah, a little bit.  Oh, good.  This one says, uh, blah, blah, blah.  She plans to give her...  This one says the same thing.  But then it says that, I guess they're making, like, a documentary or something.  And, uh, the guy, uh, I guess who's dealing with her says, I was surprised she said that  because in all my dealings with her, she made it clear that it was a business decision  for her.  Uh-oh.  Australian filmmaker Justin Sisley told the Huffington Post recently, now, given how big  the story is in Brazil, she's trapped.  If she doesn't give any money to charity, she's going to look really bad, so... 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, that's...  Yeah, she's...  The money's for her.  So now she's fucked.  The money's for her, but she can't say that because then everyone's gonna yell and scream  prostitution.  Right.  A little louder.  Because in the end, it's prostitution.  But if now she's doing the right thing with some of the money, then maybe it's not so much,  I guess.  Yeah, three quarters of a million dollars for fucking pussy?  That's crazy.  Well, it's a whole thing, though.  They're making a film and everything.  Uh, yeah, she also caused controversy when she revealed she would be followed every step 
[01:06:30]  of the way by an Australian crew for a documentary film called Virgins Wanted.  Are they gonna, uh, film her fucking?  Uh, no.  I just don't get why you'd want a virgin.  I saw this as a business.  I have the opportunity to travel to be part of a movie and get a bonus with it.  Uh, well, the guy has money to burn, obviously.  He's not gonna go broke by paying the 780.  But as a man, though, like, would you rather have sex with a virgin or would you rather  have sex with...  I'm not saying a whore, but a girl who had slept with quite a few guys and had experience.  Virgins were fun, man. 
[01:07:00]  Really?  They each have their, uh, pluses.  But if you're gonna pay, like, I would rather pay for the experience that I know is going  to be good.  Like, if I could...  If I had the opportunity to fuck a virgin, like, that I just met on the street, like,  I've already...  I've been in that situation a few times, so I know it's kind of difficult, but it's like,  whatever, alright, whatever.  But if I was to pay money, I would never pay for that situation.  But you can just go to a bar and get some fucking girl that's gonna fuck you.  Maybe.  Nah, maybe.  More so than you would a virgin.  A virgin is a lot harder. 
[01:07:30]  The virgin is like...  The virgin is the, uh, you know, the fucking rare one.  Well, I...  That's the rarity.  I mean, yeah, you...  I mean, there's a fine line, because, yeah, sure, you want a girl with experience, but you  also don't want a girl that all of a sudden you start making out with her, next thing  you know, she bends over and fucking opens up her asshole for you.  Why not?  That's what we do.  That's what we part company.  Well, you want...  You want the...  You want the hunt a little bit, is what I'm saying.  I like to fuck...  When I'm fucking and she turns over, I want a shoe to fall out. 
[01:08:00]  And a guy wearing it.  But that's what I mean.  There's a fine line.  Sure, you want some experience, but maybe you don't want too much experience.  Yeah.  But virgins, I just don't like that.  You want a bit of a challenge there.  It's too innocent.  I don't like...  Like I said, innocence doesn't turn me...  You mean hate innocence?  I don't hate it, but it doesn't turn me on sexually.  Well, this lady, because the prostitution thing is, you know, a lot of people yell and scream 
[01:08:30]  and that.  She says, if you only do it once in your life, then you are not a prostitute.  Just like if you take one amazing photograph, it does not automatically make you a photographer.  No, but if you kill one person, you are a murderer.  There you go.  The auction is just business.  I'm a romantic girl at heart and believe in love, but this will make a big difference  to my area.  Sure will.  She needs a push out.  That's about it.  Sure will.  Yes.  The Virgin, Katerina, will be delivered to her buyer on board a plane between Australia 
[01:09:00]  and the U.S.  And she'll be interviewed before and after the sexual act.  Ah.  The intercourse itself will not be filmed, and Natsu, the Virgin, will retain a right to  be anonymous without his picture appearing...  Oh, sorry.  I fucked that up.  The intercourse itself will not be filmed, and Natsu, that's the guy who paid for this,  will retain a right to be anonymous without his picture appearing in the media.  Wow.  That's the guy who just wants to do it.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's not looking to be like a Donald Trump type of person, getting publicity for 
[01:09:30]  himself.  Sex toys will be banned from use, and a condom will be compulsory.  Ah, fuck that shit.  He's gonna wear a rubber to fuck a virgin?  For $780,000?  Fuck you.  My dick would literally be standing like a mushroom cap on my fucking torso.  It wouldn't budge.  Come on.  A condom and a virgin together.  What the hell's that about?  Scalding tea and a hammer is more sexually exciting to me than a fucking condom and a 
[01:10:00]  virgin.  Oh, beat it.  I'd rather fuck a frog while it's trying to hop.  The virgin says she was prepared to prove to any skeptics that she has not had sex before.  Oh.  So why don't we become some skeptics?  Yes, exactly.  Yes, we're skeptics.  We're skeptics.  We gotta examine you.  Get over here with your hymen.  She's probably taking it in the ass a bunch of times and drank cum.  Oh, man.  Natsu will be tested for sexually transmitted diseases prior to the encounter.  He's the investor there.  The guy that paid the money.  A male virgin. 
[01:10:30]  This is where this shit doesn't work both ways.  A male virgin named Alexander, who is also being followed as part of director Justin  Selsi's documentary.  Who wants to guess how much he got for his virginity?  To a man or a woman?  A Brazilian woman was the highest bidder for the man.  So the girl virgin got $780,000.  $1.75.  Not too far off, sir.  How much?  $3,000.  Three Gs?  Jesus.  What the hell's that about?  And who's the chick that fucking decided to bid that? 
[01:11:00]  How do you say N-E-N-E?  Nanny?  Nanny?  My Nanny.  Nanny?  Nanny.  Nanny.  I don't know.  Nanny B.  Katerina, the virgin, previously said she wanted to plow the money.  What?  Says P-L-O-U-G-H to me.  Uh-huh.  Oh, look at Alexander.  Oh, boy.  He's online.  He's sold.  Eight bids.  Eight bids. 
[01:11:30]  Great.  The Japanese businessman bid on him, too.  Yeah.  I want to put it in H-E-N-E.  The bidding for her went from $800 to $65,000.  Like, immediately.  You know how fast $800 guy was wiped out?  God damn it.  He was excited, though.  He was excited for five minutes.  He's like, I'm willing to go to a grand, too.  I'm just going to put $800.  I'll start with $800, but I got a grand.  I got it.  He was hoping this wouldn't catch on and nobody would notice.  He'd be the only bidder.  Oh, he lost bad. 
[01:12:00]  She's pretty, man.  Yeah, Brazilian chicks, right?  She's nice.  I'd like to stick it right or shit her.  Yeah!  I'm going to turn my phone off.  Oh, we...  But they didn't make the earth flat. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, they also don't sing.  Or march.  Or march.  Yeah, let's relax.  It's just a dumb song.  The more honest song would be, we are the dinosaurs mindlessly shitting.  We are the dinosaurs, and have space rock wiped us out?  We are the dinosaurs moping, eating leaves.  We are the dinosaurs.  We built nothing in 60 million years.  Oh, we are giant, dumb, cunt lizards. 
[01:13:00]  We know nothing, nothing.  All we do is shit and lay eggs and die, and I'm standing there.  Oh, we used to roam the earth and own it, own it.  Now we're humiliated by being in a museum standing wrong.  That's my whole song.  It's a nice song.  Thank you.  You want to do some Jacktober?  Yes.  You do?  Really?  Jack-tober, mother of a man.  You didn't have to do the fugitive thing yesterday. 
[01:13:30]  All right, we could do some Jacktober.  Yeah.  Certainly.  Let's hit that sweeper there.  It's Jacktober.  A celebration of all things shitty in radio.  That's not very nice.  Fantastic failures of pontificating proportions.  That's so bad.  Wow.  An interactive exploration of what makes radio rancid.  Jacktober.  OMG.  Hosts, holes, bits, and stunt boys. 
[01:14:00]  This isn't funny.  It's time for Jacktober.  I got a tree on my house.  I like the intro, but it's not accurate.  No?  I don't think there's any stunt boys anymore.  I think that has gone away the last year or two.  Turd!  There's no more turds.  Ah, hey, turd!  Oh, we never played turd going into the wall.  The turd going into the wall, man.  Do you have that?  Oh, God.  E-Rock, this is an example of a...  Of a stunt boy.  Of a stunt boy, which I don't think...  Turd!  I don't think there's a lot of stunt boys left. 
[01:14:30]  No, no.  Well, with the lawyers involved, it's very hard  to have your stunt boy.  Now, the stunt boy's been replaced  by the sort of unpredictable young guy.  Ah, he just says crazy things.  Crazy guy.  And he's out all night drinking.  Yeah.  He's a big sports fan.  Yeah.  Staying up late watching the big game.  Right.  You think that's what the guy does?  He's always watching the big game,  drinking a brew.  At the local bar.  Oh, yuck.  Enjoying some different brews.  He doesn't even think about the fact  that there's a morning show to get up for. 
[01:15:00]  That's not his life.  He rolls into work.  That's right.  Having some brewskis.  He enjoys a good pilsner.  A good pumpkin ale.  Yeah.  Because it's the season.  Seasonal beers.  Looks like an airplane.  What happened?  We got another UFO.  It looks like an airplane reversed  because of some kind of heat shit.  Yeah, but it's just kind of hanging there.  Are you serious, sweetie?  Sorry, we're looking at a...  UFO sighting.  Yeah.  In Kentucky.  You know, the atmosphere and heat and shit 
[01:15:30]  can do amazing things with objects.  It's not a UFO.  It's a fucking trail of a plane's engines.  The close-up looked like a plane  that had its image reversed  because of some kind of atmospheric thing.  Go to that still pic that's really blown up,  and you could see, like...  Yeah, that one.  Look, there's a tail.  Wow.  A blue nose on the plane.  Where?  Where?  Look at the tail.  Like, it's almost...  You can almost see a logo on the tail. 
[01:16:00]  It's one of those.  No, you're crazy.  Look at the top.  Split that in half right down the middle.  No, that's a UFO.  Look to the right.  Okay.  That blue with the orange dot on it  looks like a...  Maybe it's a plastic veil.  Turn it...  Turn it...  A blue...  Where are you?  Just put your finger there.  It's like an airplane tail.  You're saying right there, right?  Yeah.  Upside down.  Because it's just like a mirror image  or backwards mirror image.  I don't know.  Kind of like that old story  of how, like, the image of a trumpet  hung in the sky for, like, 40 minutes  because of some weird fucking swamp gas. 
[01:16:30]  Yes.  Swamp gas.  It's swamp gas.  It's not a UFO.  Swamp gas.  It's ball lightning.  Why do they think that the smoke  would be fucking lit up  but then the outline of the actual object  would be fucking faded and hazy?  Yeah.  What is it?  A ghost UFO?  Ooh.  Yes.  Maybe it was a malfunctioning UFO  that was supposed to be invisible.  I got a question about UFOs, right?  Yeah.  Sure.  With all the telescopes we got,  why don't we see the UFO, like,  you know, in space coming toward us?  I think it's so fast. 
[01:17:00]  Vast.  But then all of a sudden we see it this way.  No, but they probably can fly  without being seen.  Like, literally,  you know how we're...  Then why are we seeing it there  is my question.  Malfunctioning.  Are UFOs malfunctioning?  Sure.  I mean, they are built by creatures  that are living.  It's a Brady Bunch UFO.  We...  And then it's actually Mr. Brady  playing it out of his asshole.  That's him skydiving.  We will eventually be able... 
[01:17:30]  Invisibility will be within our reach.  It's like...  Uh-oh.  Future Jimmy.  Future Jimmy.  Do we have the future Jimmy sounder?  We should.  Well, you know how they have  these weird things  they're playing with already  where you have a camera  on the front of you  and the back  and they're showing basically  an image on your stomach  of what is directly behind you  so you appear to be invisible  but you're not.  Right.  Like, we're just teasing  with that technology.  Fast forward a thousand years.  Alright, let's go a thousand years  in the future.  We will have that technology  perfected  not only for standing there 
[01:18:00]  but for moving  and it will be  impossible to see.  Well, and will it be like  Predator kind of camouflage  where you could go up  in the tree  and it's kind of...  Ah!  Ah!  I got a tree on my shirt.  I got a tree on my house.  On my house.  Yeah, it could be that.  That's a way to say  why we don't see UFOs.  Well, how about we do  a little John Tober  as we think about it?  Sam, who are we looking at today?  Oh, stop touching me, Edgar.  Today, we're going to go back 
[01:18:30]  international.  What?  So that means Canada?  Canada.  Oh, Canada.  Ontario.  And 91.5...  Ontario.  The Beat.  The Beat.  The Beat.  The Beat.  Is that just above Rochester  or Buffalo?  What part of Ontario?  It's by Toronto, right?  I don't know.  We've got to Google map  that shit.  Where is this place?  It's actually B-E-E-T, right?  And they praise the little vegetable.  No, of course not, Anthony.  That's ridiculous. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, I'm sorry.  Beats are delicious.  Yeah.  I was reading all your tweets last night.  Beats are delicious and juices.  Are they?  I like them, too.  I don't think I've ever had a beat.  I went on a vegetable rant yesterday.  I figured out what Twitter's all about, finally.  Vegetables?  Yep.  Nah, but they can't use it.  Well, today I'm going to do fruits.  See?  Yeah.  Right.  Hands don't work.  Someone pointed out another difference between me and you.  You were, like, ranting and raving about race last night on your Twitter.  Oh, they were saying, yeah.  And I was talking about vegetables. 
[01:19:30]  It's like, Obie's talking about fruits and vegetables, and Anthony's ranting about blacks  and guns.  People are getting annoyed.  That just adds fuel to my Twitter fire.  I'm like, okay, you're annoyed.  Don't encourage them.  You're really going to get fucking pissed off.  Don't encourage them, folks.  I think I had 20 tweets about vegetables.  But you cleared a lot of shit up that people have been wondering about for a long time.  Thank you, Sam.  Thank you.  But it's not about me and my vegetable tweets on Obie Radio.  It's about this fine show in Canada. 
[01:20:00]  Easy pickings for the opster at a bar.  Easy pickings.  I put up numbers.  The opster put up numbers.  It was long, flowing hair.  And shining optimism.  And shining optimism, yes.  I used to smile a lot.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Girls love it.  Don't touch me.  They kind of liked it.  Now it's all about scowling all the time.  Oh, of course.  By the way, good job with the Joe DeRosa video.  I finally saw you.  Oh, thank you. 
[01:20:30]  Those fight scenes seemed a bit real.  Yeah.  Did he get hurt?  No.  Not at all.  No, you just got to, you know, you just got to grab.  Stop touching me.  You got to grab and you got to slap.  When you slap, you got to slap.  I thought Joe DeRosa did a good job with all those videos.  That's in one.  Jimmy's in one.  I told you that.  I liked it.  Bonnie's in one.  And then guys I don't really know.  I only watched yours, Hans, and mine.  I think there's five or six of them.  Kenny's been doing the same thing he did to you yesterday off the air to me. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  He just keeps following me around asking me if I know that you're going to, that you're  a security guard now.  Yeah.  He just told me to shut the fuck up.  Why do you keep saying that?  He's trying to start bits.  It never works.  He told me in the hallway today that you're in an open marriage.  He's just annoying.  But he said you're in an open marriage.  I'm not in an open marriage.  And then you're going to be fucking Sal's mom.  Gee.  Well, that might happen, but that doesn't mean I'm in an open marriage.  He did tell me all that, so.  Where do you see the DeRosa videos?  Is it on our Facebook page?  At least ours, Iraq?  Yes, they are.  Our three? 
[01:21:30]  Our three?  The link that Joe gave me to all his videos are up there.  We don't need all.  We want mine, Anthony's, and Jimmy's.  Yeah, delete the other ones.  Yeah, fuck the other guys.  I don't know them, and I don't care about them.  Yeah, I don't want DeRosa's work out there other than these three.  That's right.  The other ones are to be wiped out.  Yeah, put them back up on the top of the Facebook page so people can enjoy some fine acting.  All right, so it's 91.5, the beat in Ontario, Canada, and the beat breakfast with Carlos, 
[01:22:00]  Sophie, and Dave.  That's right.  It's the beat breakfast.  Is it the typical Holt situation here?  Yeah, well, you got Carlos.  He's a little more experienced.  He's like a...  He's like the radio veteran.  Carlos.  You teach me the mamba.  Mamba.  He's a guy who's in his 40s, but he's still young.  You know, he still keeps up with what's going on.  He really cares about Gangnam style and all that stuff.  And then you got the chick.  All right, let's see.  Sophie.  She's a little younger. 
[01:22:30]  Let me see what Sophie looks like.  Let's see what Sophie looks like so we can put a face to the name, as they say.  She claims to be 28.  Claims to be 28.  I mean, listen, I don't have a birth certificate, but that's what she says on the air.  She's all right, I guess.  There's nothing wrong there.  And then Dave is like, you know, he's a little more opinionated than the common broadcaster,  if you know what I mean.  Does Sophie have to tame him down every so often?  Well, sometimes Sophie knows where the conversation is going, and right before it gets to a place 
[01:23:00]  it shouldn't, is able to say, hey, guys.  What?  Does that really happen here?  Did she make a choice?  It's not.  Oh, no, you didn't.  Why not?  No, she might make a choice.  I miss that fucking guy.  I know.  Damn it.  God.  Are you serious?  You know what I'm saying?  Make the choice between the two.  Do we have Lady Rock?  Have we ever done a whole Tippy Tom weekend? 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, we did Tippy Tom, the best of Tippy Tom right after he died.  When he died?  We did a whole tribute to him.  Fuck.  What a great special I was, too.  That guy did more good radio than anybody.  Oh, all of us.  It was every time.  Yeah.  There's not one appearance by Tippy Tom where we left the studio going like, ah, he just  didn't have it today.  He fell flat.  Yeah.  When he would fucking chase you around and you would spray him with fucking...  Spray him because, yeah, he was stoned.  Spray him with Lysol.  Like 30 second sprays of Lysol. 
[01:24:00]  Get away from me.  Get away.  Oh, I was petrified.  That moment never came where we were like, you know what?  Maybe we should rest Tippy for a little bit.  He's been in a bunch.  Didn't matter.  Didn't ever happen.  That guy from the first time till the last.  And he just couldn't fucking quit drinking.  Fell down the goddamn steps.  Fell down the stairs.  I fell down the stairs.  That's how he died?  My shoes came off from my glances.  Where'd he fall down?  Subway.  That was it.  Cracked his head?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess, you know, the subway steps are fucking pretty steep. 
[01:24:30]  And, uh, yeah.  He might have got punched.  Who knows?  He might have got thrown down the steps.  You never know.  Yeah, they all treat each other like animals.  They're all so beaten up and, you know, bruised.  But he was in deep trouble, though.  He wasn't going to make it too much longer.  Remember poor Ziggy?  We gave him a bunch of stuff from the fucking homeless shopping spree and he got beat up  and got it all stolen.  Fucking just...  We lose Ziggy, too?  It's the jungle out there.  Is he dead?  Yeah, Ziggy's dead.  Jesus.  Tyler, I don't know. 
[01:25:00]  Anyway, it's Jack-tober time.  Let's get into this, uh, this show, The Beat Breakfast.  I think it's the biggest song in the world.  I mean, when you're the biggest artist in the world...  Wait, what's the biggest song in the world?  I guess we'll find out.  Uh, what's the biggest song in the world?  The...  Oh, we are the dinosaurs marching, marching.  We are the dinosaurs.  What do you think of that? 
[01:25:30]  We are the dinosaurs marching, marching.  We are the dinosaurs.  We make the earth flat.  We make the earth flat.  I watched that movie last night.  I was so frustrated when you guys started playing it on the air.  Yeah, but we're more frustrated about something else, Sam.  We're just not noticing what's going on in the studio right now.  What?  What now?  What now?  Whoa!  What was the 30-second delay?  I was pulling Tippy Tom stuff, because you mentioned Tippy Tom stuff, and you said,  do you have that?  Because Anthony was making the...  So I was pulling that, and then you threw a left hook at me here with this. 
[01:26:00]  I called one-task Nagel, they call him out.  A left hook.  There was a fish on it, so you've been into it.  There you go.  Another bad joke.  Keep going.  Oh!  Oh!  E-Rock's had it.  I'm sorry, E-Rock.  I'm going to get him a jitterbug for Christmas.  Oh.  Those phones are easy to work.  A jitterbug?  Yeah.  Those what?  He had a noise.  Why?  He's all mad after a 30-second delay.  But he's in there fucking...  I see him.  He's in there having a laugh, and Kenny are high-fiving.  Yeah.  Sloughing off.  What? 
[01:26:30]  What?  What?  What?  What now?  Nothing.  We just want to acknowledge that there was 15 seconds of dead air.  God forbid we acknowledge it.  Exactly.  As opposed to the four hours we usually put out.  What?  Did he notice you staring at his monitor?  Huh?  Did he notice you staring at his monitor?  I don't know.  For the full 30 seconds.  Just looking.  Why is it quiet?  Oh.  It wasn't 30 seconds, but it was a long time.  It felt long in here.  That was forever.  Kenny's enjoying it.  Do you think that was a long delay? 
[01:27:00]  Just a tad.  Oof.  Can we hear that again, E-Rock?  Yeah.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  All of a sudden, he's fucking...  He's Kenny Q.  Yeah, look at him.  I want to see if we were wrong.  Yeah, let's see this.  Because you really overreacted.  Could you back up the tape, please?  Didn't he yell at me?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Criticized my fat joke?  You really did.  Yelling?  The pressure's getting to E-Rock.  All the entries coming in about you?  It is.  In the audio contest?  Yeah.  Yesterday, he said that this wasn't a problem, that this just happened a couple times this 
[01:27:30]  week, but him not paying attention is not an issue.  He paid attention today.  What are you talking about?  We just waited 20 seconds.  But in the end, he got what I was going for.  Eventually.  I want to hear it again, because he really overreacted.  Maybe we're wrong here.  That's possible.  Kenny?  I take the blame and responsibility.  I distracted Eric.  Oh.  It wasn't his fault.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I distracted him. 
[01:28:00]  Thanks for diffusing the bit.  What?  Kenny just diffuses the bit.  He always gets beat up.  Yeah.  You know, I stand by people.  I try not to throw more balls.  I wish those people were not in this studio that you were standing by.  It was Al-Qaeda.  Exactly.  And you were kneeling by them.  Yes.  I wish you were standing by a guy on a cell phone the other day and parked on the side  of the road.  He is a dinosaur. 
[01:28:30]  Stupid.  Yeah.  Stupid.  He is a dinosaur, but his brain is smaller than most.  Eric, you got it?  I think it's the biggest song in the world.  I mean, when you're the biggest artist in the world.  Wait, what's the biggest song in the world?  I guess we'll find out.  What's the biggest song in the world?  Listen to how long that was.  It was about six seconds. 
[01:29:00]  That's a radio eternity.  And then he goes mad.  And then he goes, what?  What?  What?  What could you possibly be upset with me about?  He's been catching a lot of heat.  I've seen even on Twitter and stuff about not paying attention.  Right?  You're on comment.  Sure.  Why not?  Oh.  How did Kenny distract you?  What was he doing?  Yeah.  Nothing.  He was standing here.  Kenny had nothing to do with it.  He was just standing here next to me.  Oh, boy.  So he wasn't distracting you? 
[01:29:30]  I was pulling Tippi Tom, and then I didn't hear you wanted the cue for the dinosaur thing.  He was.  All right.  All right.  Back to Jacktober.  I think it's the biggest song in the world.  I mean, when you're the biggest artist in the world, you go and you actually do the dance  and sing the song for the head of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, who's also from Korea,  which is what happened yesterday in New York City.  It's crazy.  We're not going to be hearing from Psy, I think, again.  The chances are that it's going to be huge, and then suddenly it's just going to go away, 
[01:30:00]  and we're not going to hear from him again.  Well, yeah.  And I find it hard to believe he's going to be able to beat the success that he's had.  What the fuck are they talking about?  Gangnam style.  Yeah, that guy.  What?  He's that rapper.  He's that Korean rapper guy.  Is he popular?  Apparently, yeah.  Huge right now.  And he was introduced to the big muckety-muck there.  And they were doing the dance together?  I saw a clip.  This is popular.  What's the dance?  I don't know.  Anybody want to take a swing at that number? 
[01:30:30]  That's on this video.  Oh, holy shit.  What?  What?  What?  What?  532 million views.  532 million fucking views on this guy.  And listen to this.  It's just crazy.  Who's going to do this?  What?  Gangnam style.  Oh, yeah.  Gangnam style.  Gangnam style.  What is that little guy doing here? 
[01:31:00]  Hot bitches.  Hot bitches.  Fuckin'.  Yeah, that's not bad.  This shirt's pretty cool.  It's catchy, but why 531 million views?  Because Koreans probably don't have that many stars like this.  Asians.  Yeah, but this is more than that.  This is here.  This is everywhere.  This is everywhere.  This is the biggest song in the country.  Fuck.  I'm saying he's different, though. 
[01:31:30]  He's very different.  And the beat is good.  My videos are just as good as this.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  There we go.  This is what Henry Blake died for.  Jesus.  Gangnam style.  He's riding a horse.  This is a big hit at the New York Comic Con.  I bet this song was being played every five minutes on the floor. 
[01:32:00]  Hey, sexy lady.  It's English.  I would download this.  Hey, you haven't heard this?  It's good, but there's parts of it that are a little too typical.  You know, Sam, I haven't.  I got two kids.  Is he naked?  Oh, no.  I mean, you...  That's very funny.  I mean, yellow suit.  Yellow suit. 
[01:32:30]  He's got some moves.  Oh, Jesus.  I don't know what it is.  In the elevator with some guy doing a hump move above his head.  Very colorful video.  Yeah, it's a good video.  Is he an actual artist?  Yeah.  Is he one of these self-made guys?  No, he's like a big-time rap dude.  I had no idea.  Look at this chick.  See, he's already famous.  Like a shoving hook kimchi pot. 
[01:33:00]  I really like this.  Yeah.  Catch it.  It's too bad the government takes every fucking set he's made off this song.  South Korea or North Korea?  No, this is a good Korea.  South Korea.  North Korea.  North Korea.  They would never allow it.  No way.  Imagine fucking...  Yeah, I don't think North Korea...  I don't think they'd like this. 
[01:33:30]  I don't think the video would look like this either.  Partying chicks and driving cars.  Black and white.  Fucking grainy.  If I actually asked that question, I'm an idiot.  Of course.  No, why wouldn't this come out of the biggest communist regime in the world?  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Yeah, of course it's the good girl.  Number two song in the country.  Oppan Gangnam Style.  Sexy lady. 
[01:34:00]  Oppan Gangnam Style.  Sexy lady.  Gangnam Style.  Oppan Gangnam Style.  Damn.  Five hundred thirty-one million fucking views.  And one more.  And one at five, baby.  That's right.  There you go.  Almost as good as Sam's Apple video.  Almost.  Almost.  Almost.  Does he speak English, this guy?  A little bit, yeah.  He was up here.  Yeah, he was here last week.  Like, uh...  What? 
[01:34:30]  In the...  In the...  Yeah, when did we have him?  A couple weeks ago.  Oh, I didn't know that.  I didn't know.  Right before he did Saturday Night Live, he was up here.  He did SNL.  Was he usually in the day or in the morning?  Did he do that?  I mean, it's...  Yeah.  Afternoon.  He did that song on SNL?  Yeah.  They did a whole skit with him.  Really?  Yeah.  What was the skit?  It was like, uh...  Was he talking about, uh, like, uh, getting different hairstyles that were, like, celebrities  around the United States?  I don't know where they got it from.  And then he'd go down at the end, like, I like a Tom Cruise.  No?  Yes. 
[01:35:00]  Well, anyway, this dumb show in Canada is talking about this guy, I guess.  That's...  Okay, that makes sense.  I find it hard to believe he's going to be able to beat the success that he's had with  Gangnam Style with a different song.  Gangnam Style.  Scooter Braun wants me to sing in English now.  Yeah, but does he even speak English?  Yeah.  But can he sing an entire song in the English language?  That's a good question.  That's a good question.  He may be able to.  It's going to be one of those, you know when you hear people talking in a different language  and they throw in English words every once in a while?  Well, like, hey, sexy lady? 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, exactly.  You know?  Yes.  Oh, yes.  That's the angle they took on that.  Oh, yes.  Yeah, they decided to spin that one in their own direction.  Wow.  It did sound like another language.  I guess.  I'll give her that much.  I don't think that's what that is.  I don't think that's what that is.  So far, this is not that bad.  It's just, it's a little boring, but I don't care what they're talking about.  Right.  But they're not, they're just chatting about something. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, he's not doing the, uh.  Let's see if it gets better.  Carlos brings up a story about when women no longer consider themselves young.  Sophie doesn't like it.  When they're five!  And I found this story very interesting about when women no longer consider themselves young.  If you ask them, it is after their 28th birthday.  Oh, my God.  Oh, shit.  A new survey found that 28 years old.  Why would you tell me this?  I just, I just.  I'm trying to make you cry.  No, no, no.  It's the line in the sand to start concentrating more on work and less on your sex life, apparently. 
[01:36:30]  Why would anybody do that?  Why would you want to concentrate less on that?  That's a very, not nice to say at all.  I'm not saying that you should do this.  That's not nice.  Oh, there's the hole.  That's not nice.  There she is.  There's the hole.  But just like wrecking a serious moment, like just shut up.  Right.  That's not nice to say at all.  Well, maybe that's how women feel.  And that's where the jokes come in.  What the fuck?  You idiot.  Well, it's just not a nice thing.  That's exciting.  Jokes are fun.  But if it hurts somebody's feelings, is it worth it? 
[01:37:00]  Well, that's true.  You know?  Something to think about.  By the way, I looked down at my Twitter.  A bunch of people saying the delay was long enough for me to look up to see if I lost my XM signal.  By the way.  Oh, he rocks.  Sophie and Carlos try to make Sophie feel better about that thing that they were just talking about.  Yeah, really.  And then Carlos, instead of saying, you know, something like, why don't you stop bitching?  Right.  Shut up, you old fucking, with your fucking raisin ovaries. 
[01:37:30]  Something like that.  If you dried out plumbing.  He tries to make sure.  If you sneeze, a fallopian tube's going to fall out.  Fucking abandoned warehouse plumbing.  Listen, I'm 43 and I'm saying that.  I'm not, well, I don't know.  You, as many people have said it, maybe a little bit of the Peter Pan syndrome.  You think, Carlos?  Really?  I'm young at heart, Sophie.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, I'll let you know how it goes.  But I don't have any plans to do either of those things. 
[01:38:00]  Okay.  I think women are in their prime when they're in their 30s and even 40s.  Yes.  You see some of the celebrities out there that have aged very, very well.  Well, yes.  Like Shania Twain.  I mean, she's really hot now.  Mm-hmm.  That could be you.  She's in her 40s.  Yeah, it could be.  It could be.  With a little bit of work and less sex, apparently.  No, no, no.  Listen, I disagree with that.  You can have all of that and more.  Why would you concentrate less on that?  This coming from the guy who, you know, sleeps in Never Never Land. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  There's a lot going on in Never Never Land.  Sprinkles and fairy dust out there.  It's pretty fun over there.  Yeah.  No, good for you.  Thanks.  Oh, boy.  Canadian time.  Wow, she's just depressed.  Yeah.  God, she really.  She's just depressed.  She really didn't like the sound of that fucking comment.  Why grow up?  Why do you have to grow up ever?  Oh.  You got to have some responsibilities, obviously.  But growing up's stupid.  His whole job, though, is to make sure that she stays happy. 
[01:39:00]  Like, he doesn't want the mood to go down.  He's got to stay positive.  She's depressed by that story.  She doesn't like that story at all.  And, I mean, let's be honest.  Shania Twain is talked about more now than ever.  Am I right, guys?  Please, of course.  You can't go anywhere without hearing her name.  Well, Shania's pretty hot.  She's probably had a lot of face work, too, right?  Yeah, I mean, she was hot before.  I'm a Gangnam Style.  Gangnam Style.  Gangnam Style.  Gangnam Style.  Gangnam Style. 
[01:39:30]  This is a stuck-in-your-head one.  Yeah.  A good one.  What does Gangnam Style mean?  I've heard it's like a geographic place in Korea where rich people hang out.  Like the ass?  Like, say, in Miami or something.  Beverly Hills or something.  Or Camden.  Northern Camden.  You're a Camden style.  Yeah.  With a gun in your face.  Because they're criminals.  And that's why the dance is like riding a horse, because that's what the rich people 
[01:40:00]  would do in that little town.  Nice.  We continue with Jacktober.  You know, last we left you a couple seconds later.  She was very depressed, but they're going to bring it all together with a fun little bit.  Yeah, it's important to do bits.  Good.  All right.  Steeler's wheel stuck in the middle with you, Gloria.  You've seen Reservoir Dogs, right?  Yeah.  You know this song.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, here it comes.  Don't know why I came here tonight.  I got the feeling there's something right. 
[01:40:30]  I'm just kidding in case I fall off my chair.  People, I know the bit.  They're going to sing into her ovaries how dry I am.  Nobody knows how dry I am.  Morning karaoke.  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah.  And I'm wondering if I'll ever be there.  Clowns to the left of me.  Jokers to the right.  Here I am stuck in the middle with you.  Yes, I am stuck in the middle with you. 
[01:41:00]  All right.  That was pretty good.  Yeah.  The first line is so scared or I may fall off the stairs or something.  What is it?  I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs.  Right, right, right, right.  Get down the stairs.  We'll give it to you.  We got the gist of it, so that works for us.  Yes, congratulations.  She had to point out that she kind of didn't get it right.  Of course.  Ugh.  What a nudge.  Nobody would do radio with a broad.  A know-it-all.  Dude, why would you do radio with a broad?  I don't care.  I mean, Amy Schumer's coming in.  That's a whole different situation. 
[01:41:30]  But you're also, you got to know.  Like, this type of, well, that's why I say broad.  This is like a broad.  Amy's a gal.  Yeah.  Amy's a gal.  The type of person who would do radio with a broad is the type of person who would be okay  with doing a bit where somebody just calls up and sings the other part of a song.  Right.  Like, would you guys, like, think that, oh, yeah, that's what we'll do today.  We'll play half a song, and somebody will call up and just sing the other part.  Finish it.  Yeah, sing the other half.  You like that?  Yeah.  It sounds like fun.  It doesn't hurt anybody, Sam.  You should try it.  It definitely doesn't hurt any.  Well, it might hurt some listeners. 
[01:42:00]  Wow.  You know.  It's all good fun.  Good, clean fun.  Good, clean fun.  Well, we'll go back to Jack Tober certainly a little later on.  I'm just glad you guys found out what Gangnam Style was.  I'm just very happy we're on this early.  We're on this early.  Now you're, what, you say we missed the boat on this one, Sam? 
[01:42:30]  That's the song, right?  It's my new, right?  The peak of this hill.  It hit 531 million views overnight, right?  The peak of this hill is behind us.  You sure?  Yeah, we're running downhill right now.  Now it's just going to get bigger.  We hired you to bring the young shit to our show.  So I blame you.  All right.  I blame you.  I'll accept blame for this.  This is my responsibility.  How long has this been out?  It's probably a solid month.  All right, let's see. 
[01:43:00]  Ah, see, we're not that far behind.  I mean, it came out, came out way before that, but it's been big for at least a month.  Maybe a month and a half.  When we get back to Jack Tober in a little while, more bits.  Factor Bullcrap is on the way.  Factor Bullcrap.  I have no clue how that works.  Another Factor Bullcrap.  Yeah.  Thank goodness Factor Bullcrap isn't over.  Oh, crap.  Spent some time with that one.  And then their marquee bit called Beat Breakfast Bacon Time. 
[01:43:30]  I'm not even going to tell you how it works.  See, we probably should have blown off the first dumb first couple of clips so we could  have got into their bits.  I want you to, I want to introduce the show to everybody first, then we get to the bits.  All right, well, I took the second half of Jack Tober today.  It's going to be terrific.  Up next, we got Steiner.  Brandon Steiner.  He's, they have a giant sports memorabilia, like auction place, I believe is what he does.  And he has a book out, and they just, which one just went up on, who threw the no hit?  Was it Don Larson?  Yeah.  I think that's who, whose jersey they were auctioning off. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  And other dinks.  Yeah.  Speaking of books, I finally got to the section of Peter Criss' book where he says, and on  the phone was Gene Simmons.  I'm like, thank God.  I'm not a fan of these fucking guys talking about how they grew up.  How long does it take to get to it?  52 pages.  Jesus.  I don't mind that.  I knew someone would ask me that today.  52 pages.  52 on the dot.  Yeah, he's in gangs, he's, you know, he's got that weird life like most artists have. 
[01:44:30]  Nothing like that stands out.  I like the, uh.  Holy fuck, and then finally the chapter starts, and Gene Simmons was on the phone.  I'm like, okay, I should have started here.  Yeah.  I like to know the early stuff, if I'm interested in the person.  Some, I don't want to hear the family backgrounds, but like the fact that he would hit people  with bats and then he stabbed somebody, like there was a violence in there that I hadn't  read before.  I just think you could do that a lot quicker.  52 pages is a little too long for me, but I'm sure it's going to be terrific now.  Yeah.  I'm not giving up on the book.  That's terrific.  That's terrific. 
[01:45:00]  But 52 pages.  Did you read them all or start skimming?  I didn't skim, man.  Nope.  Sometimes I skim that early stuff before it gets to the real stuff.  Yeah.  When they start talking about, and my grandfather, I don't get, fuck.  Yeah, no, no.  I don't know about you.  No.  My grandfather.  He came over from Italy, and then he married the German broad.  I guess they got to give you the basics.  And then the German broad's uncle was.  Yeah, that I never need.  A brother was.  Can't start the book with him fucking in the middle of, you know, I want to rock and roll  all night and party every day. 
[01:45:30]  You have to give a historical context.  Like.  I think 20 pages is perfect for that shit.  Perfect.  The wrestler, Booker T, just put out a book.  Yeah.  It ends when he starts wrestling.  That's the end of the book.  Because he wants a second book.  That's stupid.  Terrible.  Writing about Robin Wendy's and stuff.  All right.  You guys want to watch the Gangnam Style video without the music, just the words?  Really?  It's kind of funny.  It's a fun angle. 
[01:46:00]  But you have to watch it, though.  What is it?  I got to piss.  Without music?  I got to piss.  I'll just say play, and then you guys can do whatever you want.  See, it's the same thing.  Right.  It's the video.  Right.  But there's no music.  See, he's just on the beach, hanging out.  It has 13 and a half million views.  Because it's funny.  Yeah, there's probably 13 million people that were like, oh, this is probably the video.  Oh, somebody put in those weird sounds? 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, they're just putting in the sound effects of what would be happening in the video without  the music.  Of course.  Without the music.  It's just fun when they're all dancing and you just hear their feet flopping on the floor.  And now the wind is blowing from the jet engine.  It sounds very loud.  Okay, they've stopped blowing on them.  It rolls.  It's kind of funny. 
[01:47:00]  All right.  That's a little visual.  All right.  That's good.  It's kind of funny.  All right.  Amy Schumer on the way.  Tom Green.  And next, Brandon Steiner.  Stay there.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P.  Anthony Show.  Want to say hi to Brandon Steiner, who's entering the studio.  Oh.  The owner of Steiner Sports Marketing. 
[01:47:30]  Hello, sir.  How are you?  Hello, hello.  How are you?  Hey, hi.  How are you doing?  Having fun this morning?  Oh, boy.  Are we.  We're absolutely having fun.  And it's interesting what you do.  Do you actually, is there any of this stuff that you want to keep, or do you just buy it  just to get rid of it?  I want to keep it all.  I want to keep it all.  Are you a collector, or like before that? 
[01:48:00]  I'm a saver.  No question.  Been a saver since I'm a kid.  Love, love, love my stuff.  The stuff that I buy.  The stuff that I create.  You know, our company's a little different because it's Steiner Sports.  We create collectibles.  So we'll replicate a lot of cool things that I really, really like.  So if I see a stick or a bat or something, we can go back, get them remade, and kind  of create a replica collectible that maybe not everybody can afford.  How about the authentic stuff, though? 
[01:48:30]  Like, what's a really impossible to get, like, baseball bat?  Like, has that heard Babe Ruth's bat got sold recently?  Was that you guys, or no?  That wasn't us, but that sold for several million dollars.  Not at all.  Anything that's authentic, that's real, that does really well, it gets people excited about  my industry, I'm excited about, whether I do it or not.  I mean, the Don Larson jersey is a one-of-a-kind.  It's a perfect game.  It's a whole uniform.  It's in great shape.  Real proud of that.  How did somebody get a hold of that? 
[01:49:00]  Was that Larson's family?  That was Larson.  He had it.  He took it right away from the game, and then he was in a museum in San Diego.  So he kept it, you know, a lot of these guys keep their stuff.  A lot of these guys are closet collectors.  Like, we just went to Coach Knight, you know.  Bobby Knight, yeah.  Yeah, Bobby Knight.  So Bob Knight is selling his collection, and I mean, we go in there, it's got to be 300  sweaters.  Wow.  Probably the sneakers since he, you know, when he's in West Point.  Trophies, rings.  And he probably didn't look at himself at all as a collector, but he's a tremendous saver.  As I am, too. 
[01:49:30]  I have all my ticket stubs as a kid and everything else.  But one of the great things we sold, which is weird, is here I am.  The Yankees get beat.  Seven games.  Yankee Stadium.  Ready to jump off the bridge.  I'm at my fourth black and white cookie.  And I realized, you know, I just did my Yankee Steiner deal.  And all of a sudden, I realized there's some crazy people up in Boston that are quadruply  as excited as anyone's ever been.  And we sold the home plate from Yankee Stadium, which we think was the curse getting reversed.  Had the whole team sign it. 
[01:50:00]  So we dug the home plate up.  And that sold for over a couple hundred grand.  About 220 grand.  How did you get the whole team to agree to sign it?  Like, how do you make a deal with Yankee Stadium and go, all right, I'd like to sell everything  here?  Well, I was, how we got, and that's a chapter in the book, by the way.  But there's a whole, we had the whole Red Sox team.  We converted Steiner, who was very Yankee-like at that time, into a very serious Red Sox entity.  And we were, we were, we were dealing with, you know, the David Ortiz and the Schillings  and the, all those guys. 
[01:50:30]  And they were happy to sign the base.  You know, they were talking a lot of smack and they were pretty hyped about winning that,  that game.  I've never seen guys talk so openly.  Usually, you know, that other team was really good.  And these guys were like, we whipped their butt.  We came back.  We did it.  Did you get every guy to sign it?  Yes.  Everyone.  Yeah.  There wasn't a holdout?  No holdouts on the Red Sox, although Schilling gave us a hard time.  And that's another part in the book as well, because, you know, he's, you know, they say  about bad things happen to bad people, but I'm not sure that, uh, he's feeling bad times, 
[01:51:00]  man.  I mean, you know, he's broke, but you know, his attitude kind of, you know, his attitude  wasn't all that good.  What happened when he was a troublemaker?  What happened when you wanted him to sign?  Did he, did he want money for it?  Wanted a lot of money, held out.  And then, you know, it's not even the.  So in the end, how did he sign?  Yeah.  How'd you get him?  Well, difficult.  You know, remember we had several thousand items we needed signed.  What made it difficult is we had his teammates.  We went up there.  He would make us do special signings without his teammates in the room. 
[01:51:30]  He wouldn't sign with his teammates in the room, which is insane.  So we go up there, we've got 3000 bats, bases, jerseys, and we'd have to go to a hotel  like a mile or two from his house because he didn't want his teammates in his house.  And he wouldn't go to the hotel and sign.  Like that, that kind of insanity.  Like Pedro Martinez was insane.  You know, the private plane and, you know, the Dom Perrion in the room.  He made you fly my private plane?  Wow.  I thought he was Frank Sinatra.  But, you know, we got a kick out of Pedro and he did come through at least. 
[01:52:00]  I mean, you know, to some degree, but he was insane with his demands.  Sounds exhausting.  Yeah.  Oh, it's exhausting.  There's a reason why I've lost some of the hair on my head.  It's not natural.  Right.  It's not hereditary or anything like that shit.  No, no.  Stress.  So you did get them to sign everything.  And do they, obviously they have to get paid to do it.  Oh, yeah.  Kind of well.  With most of them, is it a bulk payment?  Like, all right, look, we'll give you whatever it is to sit in this room for an hour and sign  X amount of things?  It depends.  And that particular team, I felt like we had something special there, frankly, and something 
[01:52:30]  that was, kind of reminded me of the 94 Rangers.  I knew this was one of those things that would never go away.  I know people are emotionally connected, and as a business person, I felt like, you know,  we wanted to sign a bunch of those guys for a long period of time.  So the David Ortiz's and, you know, I don't know if you remember Millar.  He was a character.  So we did a larger deal with him, and we did a whole bunch of appearances, media stuff.  So there's a whole bunch of things that go into play, and then you want their game used.  We soon after did Red Sox-Steiner, so we did a deal with the Red Sox, got all their game 
[01:53:00]  used.  We'll sell the dirt.  We'll lift some of the grass off the field, legal grass.  So we'll take legal grass and sell it, and then freeze-dry it, so you have a piece of  that field, maybe, that they won the championship forever.  Those are some of the creative things I like to do.  For the average guy, you know, who can't afford the Babe Ruth jersey, I'm creating other  collectibles.  I'll take the bench from that year, and I'll cut it up and do some fun stuff like that.  I've sold over $25 million of dirt.  Wow.  Really?  Wow.  I mean, listen, if you guys could be on the radio from 6 to 10, I could make a lot of 
[01:53:30]  money doing it.  I mean, I could sell...  Nah, I'm kidding.  We're in the wrong business.  I sold $25 million of dirt.  I mean, but...  That should be the name of your book.  You're right.  I thought about it, you know, turning dirt to dollars.  But, you know, I've been really creative with the dirt.  I feel like the dirt is like the modern-day version of the rabbit's foot.  Right.  It's like, why did you carry a rabbit's foot as a kid?  But the dirt is like you've got...  You know, it's something about going on the field.  Well, I was going to say, because the old days, Brandon, you know, when your team won, 
[01:54:00]  you ran out there with a little cup or something, and you got your own dirt.  You're not allowed to do that anymore.  Well, they don't allow it.  Everybody tries.  And when those players, you know, they look at me, it looks like...  I remember Mariana going, yeah, that's just the stupidest thing.  Like, why are you selling dirt?  I'm like, because you kneeled on your knees and picked up the dirt.  Right.  Every time you guys go grab a little dirt, put it in your pocket, it's promoting Steiner.  You realize that?  Oh, because the players do that?  Players do it.  So they do it to have a little memory of it.  And I think it's kind of special when you go on the field, if you've been on a field  at any of these stadiums, particularly Yankee Stadium, it's special. 
[01:54:30]  I mean, think about who the great players that have played on that field.  When you go on that field, it's just not another field, and you want to have a little keepsake  to remind you of that.  So I feel like we probably have, I think it's over 250 SKUs that have dirt in there.  If you go to steinersports.com, it's like, you know, our company is...  How much for the dirt?  I mean, it starts, you know, anywhere from about 20, 25 bucks and goes all the way up  to several hundred, depending on how the application is.  Like, we'll spray an adhesive on a photo and create a 3D effect and put dirt on the photo  so it has that kind of feel to it. 
[01:55:00]  We'll put dirt in the bat.  Like, Derek Jeter, we created these commemorative bats, because people can't afford his game  to use bat.  So we actually inserted dirt inside the bat, which is kind of cool.  People love that item.  So you saw a bat with dirt in it.  You've got to have a little dirt.  But it's basically stuff, aside from the real stuff like Larson, it's stuff that people  who don't, again, make 8 million bucks can afford to get if you want something that's  kind of a cool idea.  When they tear down a stadium, you know, they sell all the seats and all that stuff.  Well, there's a chapter in the book, which I talk about tearing the stadium down. 
[01:55:30]  And listen, a lot of stadiums have been torn down, but never like Yankee Stadium.  I did, we had to put up, Snyder Sports put up, I think, about $17 million to make that  happen.  It's a deal with the city.  We partnered up with the Yankees.  But that's a big responsibility.  Being a big Yankee fan, I wanted to make sure that everyone had a little something.  So we created hundreds of thousands of pieces.  So Reggie Jackson calls me up, what are you doing with the black out in center field?  So we cut the black up into little pieces, had to autograph it, kind of put that in a  case, sold that off. 
[01:56:00]  We sold the bleachers.  We had guys like Paul O'Neill and other guys that played right field.  Reggie Jackson signed the bleachers.  You'd have that in your basement kind of as a footstool.  You know, we took bricks.  I found the bricks.  One of the last days of the Yankee Stadium, I always loved going in the batting cage where  the players would warm up and everything.  And I saw these bricks up in the ceiling.  1929 gold brick.  Come on.  Looked them up.  They're out of business.  5,000 bricks.  It was a little expensive taking them.  And then, you know, even the freeze, you know, that up above, that was a big debacle.  What's the freeze? 
[01:56:30]  Now, the freeze is like that facade up in the top.  That Yankee Stadium is famous for right on the top of the stadium.  Yeah.  Why is it called the freeze?  It's freeze, but it's called the facade.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  It's probably the biggest mistake I've probably made since I've been in business since Snyder  Sports started in 87, 25-year anniversary this year.  And that is, this stuff weighs three tons.  There's like 12 pieces of it.  Oh, wow.  And it weighs several tons.  And it's like 18 feet wide, 12 feet tall.  Like no wife, no matter how much of a sports fan she is, is letting you bring that home. 
[01:57:00]  Right.  Put it in your backyard.  So that was quite a bit of an undertaking to actually remove that.  It cost me a half a million dollars.  And then what am I doing with it?  I've got to find somebody to buy it.  I've got a question for you.  So you come in first before they take down the stadium, obviously, right?  Oh, yeah.  Well, it was in the stadium for months.  That's what I was going to ask.  They gave you a few months to get whatever you wanted out of there before the construction  guys came in?  Absolutely.  So you took it.  Did you take every seat?  Yes.  Every single seat.  Where the fuck did you store that?  Yeah, where did you store them?  Well, that's a whole other story, having the seats, but it's a storage up in Syracuse 
[01:57:30]  and Buffalo.  Being a Syracuse grad, I mean, I'm happy to, anytime I can make the trips up there, but  we've had some, it's, there's not a lot of seats left.  Let me put it to you that way.  Yeah.  But at first you got to, you know, store them before you start selling them online and  all that.  Well, no question.  And they got to be refurbished because there was lead paint in the arms.  So that became a debacle.  So we had to restore those, but people wanted them.  But what's crazy is, and I've never told anybody this, but I'm going to tell you guys  this.  So you got 36,000 seats, you know, seats are broken and everything else. 
[01:58:00]  And we have sold quite a few, but we go up there recently to do an inventory and realize  that a guy took the cast iron seats, the actual arms of them, and took them to a metal  place and melted them down.  So we thought we had a whole bunch of seats.  We're now down to a very few because we're in a, we're in a huge problem.  This guy's getting arrested.  He's going to jail.  Well, he cashed out on a lot of the cast iron seats.  So what we thought was 36,000 seats now is a lot, lot less. 
[01:58:30]  So actually the people that bought Yankee stadium seats, this has all happened in the  last few months.  If you bought a pair of Yankee stadium seats, you really have a great collectible.  There's not going to be 36,000 seats out there on the market.  Yeah.  The value goes up.  In fact, there'll be under 10,000.  I got a, I got a dumb question.  I was a baseball card collector growing up, me and my brothers.  I knew you were a little bit of a closet collector there.  I didn't see it right up front, but it was mostly baseball cards for us, but, uh, but  we had, uh, you know, we full collections, never touched.  They're not worth anything. 
[01:59:00]  Right.  I think you got to look at the years and the sets and the most of the seventies mostly.  Yeah.  I love the seventies and the eighties.  I love them.  Really?  I love them.  If you send me an email, show me what you got a little bit.  We might have to talk.  What happened with the baseball card thing is that pretty much in the mid eighties, they  started printing a lot.  But prior to that, if you have sets, there are cards in those sets.  If they're graded and get a decent grade, they're worth some good money.  So after the mid eighties, it was stupid to collect baseball cards because there were  so many companies, right?  There's still some valuable cards.  And if you had a Dan G, a rookie, not as much. 
[01:59:30]  Right.  Got you.  But they kept putting them out to make money.  Like they would put out like, you know, the, the Don Rush series, you know, and it would  be like, uh, uh, you know, a rookie player who had some kind of heat on them and they  would sell it for 50 and $60 a card.  And now they're worth a dollar 18 a card.  It was a good deal.  Don Rush full sets.  You know what's crazy?  It's gone.  It's gone.  It's gone the other way now.  Step on my bit.  Now, I'll tell you one thing on the card thing is it's gone the other way now. 
[02:00:00]  Where are you, you know, they're printing so few cards now that it's actually probably  worth collecting a little bit now.  There's less cards out there with only one trading card company tops.  You may want to think about collecting again, but it's never going to be like the golden  era.  I got to brag.  I bring in the Don Larson perfect game card.  It was the year of that, you know, and showed it off and show and tell I was in, I don't  know, like fifth or sixth grade and some asshole didn't appreciate my happiness and took  a pen to it.  Oh, that's cool.  And I cried like a bitch. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, I don't blame you.  And then a few years ago, I told a story on the air and someone actually sent me the exact  card that this asshole rode on back in the day.  That's cold.  How much is it worth?  I don't even know.  To me, it was just special because I had it, you know, my whole life.  Not a highly, highly valuable car, but not bad.  I mean, if it's in good shape.  It was in great shape at the time, but this kid was just like, ugh, he hated my happiness.  I have a 1980 Dan Quisenberry.  Oh, nice.  Poor Dan.  Rest in peace.  Did he die?  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  I was just thinking of a name that probably wouldn't be a valuable card. 
[02:01:00]  I was right.  Kansas City is valuable.  I don't know what's going on in Kansas City.  It was there this summer.  I was very, very, very nervous trying to figure out where the town was.  Really?  I was a little lost there, but great barbecue.  But wait, it was a depressing place?  It was just, no, not really.  It was just spread out.  I mean, everything was just miles and miles and miles.  And I went to this gas station.  I forget the name of the barbecue.  And it was an almost unbelievable barbecue place.  My son had taken me there.  We do a tour.  And I've now seen every ballpark.  So we do a tour.  My son, Crosby, and I had to see every ballpark and rate the food. 
[02:01:30]  And we go right around the town.  I always go to the best where that place has to offer.  Pretty cool.  Not bad.  And what do you think the Larson jersey will get?  Hope or think?  Both.  You know, there's always prayer involved with, you know, my business.  Prayer is good.  You know, we do pray.  I don't know.  I got a feeling like this is going to get some legs on it.  It could be over a million.  Wow.  I think it's great for him.  I mean, he's never really made a lot, a lot of money.  And it's nice for him to, you know, have that legacy to leave his kids a lot of money. 
[02:02:00]  I've seen a lot of players come to me now and saying, you know, I don't want my kids  fighting over this stuff.  I don't want them arguing.  And then them having to go through the process after I'm gone, what are they going to do  with all this stuff?  Who's going to keep what?  I'd rather give them each the checks in their accounts and then, you know, everybody  be happy.  That was a little bit of Coach Knight's sentiments.  It's like, you know, I've got all, I mean, he had stuff.  I mean, crazy.  He might, I'll tell you what's crazy is he had all these ties and people bidding on  the ties, which is amazing.  He had like 200 ties.  How do you know something's like the, the, the, the signatures, like I, I never trust 
[02:02:30]  the mall.  Like I, you know, cause I, I collect stuff, but I never want to sell it.  It's almost, it's personalized.  They get it just so they know I'm not going to sell it.  And I like that.  I love people when they get stuff, you know, collecting, getting this stuff for yourself  and enjoying it is really the heart of collecting.  So when you get something in person and personalized, even though it may not have value later,  although it may, we see a lot of stuff that's from, from great celebs that are personalized  that so hard to get from presidents.  So it's great.  And that's how collecting should be.  But when you can't get that person who you really want to get something from, that's 
[02:03:00]  when you go to steinersports.com.  We're happy to facilitate that.  I have a Dirk Jeter signed ball.  It used to be signed.  And then what I did was I let it, uh, I don't know, be exposed to the sun a little too long  on my desk.  Well, I'll take that ball back from you.  You can't even see the fucking autograph anymore.  I blew it.  I'm going to take that ball back from you.  Okay.  Because I got balls and I'm going to, I'm going to actually, first of all, send you a  new one.  And then I'm also going to put that in a case so that we have these special cases that  keep the light out and it'll protect the signature. 
[02:03:30]  We've been down that road before.  Well, I should have met you years ago because this signature is long gone.  I'm happy to do that for you now.  I'm happy to do that.  You know what?  It's funny.  I got a bunch of signed boxing gloves.  Like I, and again, most of them are just to me, but I want to display them, but that's exactly  why I don't like, I put my signed posters in, in UV protection, museum glass.  Do you have boxing gloves cases that protect?  Absolutely.  If you give me your address, I'll send you some boxing glove cases.  Tell them about the, uh, the boxing gloves you gave me.  Jimmy almost had a heart attack at my house.  Well, we had the guys come in.  I mean, uh, who was it? 
[02:04:00]  Was it Bernard Hopkins or Sugar Ray Leonard?  Some fighters that might be famous.  I, uh, yeah, it was definitely a Sugar Ray Leonard and a Bernard Hopkins.  Definitely.  And Jimmy did the right thing and got me a couple, uh, signed gloves.  Thoughtful partner.  Very nice.  And the best thing to do is to have your two-year-old son running around with the gloves, like snacking  them.  Oh, no.  It was, it was, it was horrendous.  He runs up to my wife and begs her.  He's like, can you please?  It's when they take the Mickey Mantle and Babe Ruth ball, the kids, and have a catch with that 
[02:04:30]  outside.  That's painful.  How many of those stories I've heard?  How many, you know, there is a folklore in my family that we had a Babe Ruth ball, but  I'm sure you've heard this probably a hundred times.  I'm not trying to say that we're, you know, but how much is a Babe Ruth ball?  You know, believe it or not, and I killed myself over this because I've had so many earlier  in my career, but a Babe Ruth ball could be anywhere from eight or 10 grand to 40 or 50  grand.  We just sold one, uh, for 55 grand.  It was beautiful.  Mint, mint.  I mean, a really solid Babe Ruth autograph. 
[02:05:00]  It's not in pencil back then too, right?  I mean, Babe Ruth signed a lot of autographs.  If you ever see even the movies and the show, he's always signing.  Yeah, he was always hanging out.  Yeah.  So even the pictures, there's a couple of pictures of big, you know, so, you know, signing  autographs goes way back.  You know, it wasn't like, you know, people say, oh, Stider, you're the big, I'd say,  people have been signing autographs, you know, for a long, long time.  I'm happy to kind of organize it and at least create an authentic kind of process.  That's what I'm proud of is, is I create a little bit of an order to think so that down  the road, people will know what's real and not, particularly where it matters most, starting 
[02:05:30]  with the Yankees or some of the bigger names in sports.  What are rare signatures, like baseball signatures?  Because if Babe Ruth signed a lot, that means, all right, he did it.  What's, what's one that's like really?  Well, Luke Garrick is really, really hard.  Ty Cobb, very, very hard to get those.  It's very hard to get some of the initial, you know, Jackie Robinson's always a little tricky.  It's hard to get the team balls.  People collect the team balls, you know, for championship teams.  It's hard to get those.  We started that in the 90s was, I didn't know what the hell I was even doing.  I started saying, you know, it'd be great to put the whole team together.  In the mid-90s, we started putting every team together, which is something we do still. 
[02:06:00]  And that, that goes for a lot of money.  And those are hard because it's hard to get 30 guys together in a room to sign with some.  So there's a lot of bad balls out there where, you know, there was back in the 50s,  a lot of locker room guys, you know, they'd get the autograph down.  So we see a lot of balls.  I just got one the other day, a Brooklyn Dodger ball that was signed by the,  definitely signed by the locker room guy.  How do you know that?  Like, how, how, how will you know if it's a forgery?  There's, you look at certain autographs, you know, you know, there's certain autographs.  Yeah, you know, well, you, you, I'm not an authenticator, but on some of them I can, 
[02:06:30]  but if not, I go to independent authenticator just to keep everything on the up and up.  But, you know, especially that ball looked too good to be true,  but we really thought we had something and I was like, ah, somebody had a good, good, good way to go.  Um, I was going to ask you, uh, what were you doing before this?  Well, this 25 years of Steiner sports and, you know, by the way, I, you know,  I'm sorry I spent 52 pages on the beginning of my book.  Oh, you heard that?  But, you know, you got to create a connection, but usually, you know, people, 
[02:07:00]  Is it your life story?  Well, people like me, they don't look, you know, when they go to Yankee stadium,  they see me like they think that, you know, I was some rich kid growing up  and they don't realize like this was like, I had an insane, uh, childhood, very dysfunctional.  How many pages though, before you get to Steiner sports?  I probably should have spent about 20 less pages.  I'll give you that.  But there was some insane, I mean, I had to cut it down.  There's so much insanity in my house growing up.  So, uh, I, you know, to me, everything's been kind of connected.  I was in the sports bar business back in the eighties where I really made my name. 
[02:07:30]  I started at the hard rock and that was an unbelievable opportunity.  I mean, there'll never be anything like the hard rock on 57th, the grand opening,  200 people online starting at two o'clock all the way to three in the morning and never,  never wavered.  And then what I happened was I was at the hard rock and I was very grateful to be the,  I was assistant general manager and there was no hard rocks in the country.  Right.  And I said, this is a great concept, but this should be sports.  And there was only two sports bars in the country.  Really?  Yeah.  There was the ultimate sports bar in Chicago and Bobby V's, 
[02:08:00]  which is a little dumpy little dive place up in Connecticut.  That's it.  And I said, how do we, I don't know if we take all this memorabilia,  put some big screens and I'd always go to the owner of the hard rock and say,  you know, we got to put some screens in here.  And I like to have a ticker tape to show every rock and roll concert that was around  the country.  And let's put the bartenders, let's make the rock and roll guys,  instead of going upstairs, let's put them behind the guitar bar.  And he was like, just, just make sure the food gets served.  Just go.  You know, he didn't want to hear my,  so I went and we opened up a really electronic sports bar and then I went on,  open up probably eight or 10 of them. 
[02:08:30]  And then Frank, I just couldn't raise the money.  I was trying to raise the money, which is probably an ESPN zone now,  but it was 20 years ago.  And then I just said, you know,  I made friends with all these athletes in the process because at the hard rock,  nobody paid attention to an athlete because, you know,  we had Elton John coming in, Rod Stewart, who gave a, who,  who gave a shit about Keith Hernandez or, you know,  a Yankee or a giant or Lawrence Taylor, nobody.  These guys couldn't even get in the door.  I have to go outside and tell the doorman to let these guys in, which is insane.  So I made friends with them and that's how I really started Steiner. 
[02:09:00]  What's it, what's,  what's something that somebody thought was going to get a lot of money,  which was a,  what not being a complete piece of shit or a bus that they're like,  Oh, this has got to be worth a lot of money.  Well, I do a, what's it worth on my Facebook?  People send in items.  It's like, you know, I'm going to break the, you know,  the good news is, you know, you found my Facebook.  The bad news is this is, you know,  this item's a complete loser.  It's junk.  You know,  my grandfather left me this,  you know,  but why aren't you doing a TV show?  I do.  I'd watch this.  I do memories of the game,  you know,  on yes.  Yes has been really good to me.  I recognize you for this. 
[02:09:30]  You know,  did that show and we took a hiatus this year because of a whole bunch of  things I was doing.  I'll be,  I'll be back on the air next year.  Like, you know,  TV takes a long time.  Like radio is a good vehicle.  You go on TV,  it's a whole day and,  you know,  two days and you get to talk for 10 minutes or stuff.  We got a ton of guys.  Chris and Freehold.  I was at the last Yankees game,  Yankees game at the old stadium at old timers day.  And one of my friends grabbed a bunch of toilet seat covers and John Blanchard  and Moose Skowar and I guess signed them afterwards. 
[02:10:00]  Well,  people want,  you know,  people wanted the urinals for the urinals.  Is that worth anything?  Oh yeah.  People love that stuff,  especially up in Fenway.  They love the toilet seats.  You can sell that to a sports bar up there in a heartbeat.  But you know,  the urinals people wanted to,  but we decided,  you know,  that just wasn't going to be in good taste.  Yeah.  It's all,  by the way,  in the book,  you got to have balls in this book.  The whole breakdown of what I did with the stadium,  what players asked for,  what players got,  what,  who got the foul poles,  who got all the main things.  So it's kind of all in there.  Who's a really hard player to get to science though? 
[02:10:30]  Like you said in that one,  shilling was difficult,  but who's a typically,  cause I,  cause you mentioned Reggie and he was up here and Eric and I took photos with him and I got him to sign a ball.  But I,  again,  whenever you ask them to personalize it,  they almost never mind because they know you're not going to sell it.  True.  But,  uh,  he seems like he's a bit difficult to get to.  Well,  Reggie's first of all,  one of the pioneers in the business,  mainly because he signs his name.  You can read it.  And he always has so many inscriptions.  He was one of those players who did hall of fame, 
[02:11:00]  MVP,  three home runs,  you know,  all the great things he did.  So that's a great autograph.  He reminds me a lot of mantle.  Mantle took,  when he signed,  mantle was always emphatic about the perfection of his signature.  Very Mariano Rivera like to read the signature.  And there's a lot of inscriptions that go along with the signature,  which make it really special.  And mantle was the first to be notorious for that.  But Reggie took it to a whole nother level as well,  where he likes to have fun with the signature and play around where a lot of  guys don't want to write any inscriptions at all.  So it's,  you know, 
[02:11:30]  Michael Jordan's still a tough signature,  you know,  by the way,  he's always tough.  Lance Armstrong,  one of my,  one of the,  you know,  one of my things on my bucket list,  because we were trying to get him for years.  Shouldn't be as hard now.  Don't think.  Don't think I'll be looking for that autograph.  Could you sign this confession?  I don't think I'm going to be looking to get his autograph anytime soon,  but he was really difficult.  Really pissed me off.  You know,  when we can't get a guy,  you know,  Ewing was a guy,  Patrick Ewing,  still very difficult autograph.  We finally broke him,  broke him in this summer, 
[02:12:00]  got him,  which I'm real proud of.  What is it you offer them enough?  Are they,  cause a lot of these guys have enough money.  They don't need the money.  Well,  you let me know whatever it is.  He thought that I thought was enough.  It wasn't enough.  And he's like,  next time I come back,  you better have more.  But it's like,  Patrick are not playing anymore,  but he was,  you know,  he was very gracious.  And he never won a championship being a long time.  Still a gold,  still a gold medal guy and a great,  you know,  NBA top 50.  Did you have a question,  Travis?  Yeah,  I do.  Our producer wants to ask you a question.  When did this whole card grading thing explode?  Because now you can't sell anything, 
[02:12:30]  you know,  for,  for a high value without,  you know,  going to get it professionally graded.  And now they do it with comic books and magazines.  And,  and this is an industry in itself to,  to send your,  your stuff out to get professionally graded.  Right.  It's a good question.  I remember,  I remember,  you know,  going to,  you know,  memorabilia shows with my dad and,  and nothing,  nothing's graded.  You were just buying stuff from,  from other collectors.  If it looked good,  it looked good.  If it looked good,  it looked good.  Exactly.  If,  if the ball looked like it was signed,  you know,  you,  you,  you bought it or whatever,  but now like you,  you can't,  nobody buys anything unless it's professionally graded by whoever. 
[02:13:00]  It goes back to the theory,  you know,  you don't want to invent electricity and you want to invent the meter.  Some guy figured out,  you know,  listen,  I don't have to have the collectible.  I just going to,  I'm just going to grade.  I'm going to be the guy that grades it.  It's unbelievable.  And it's not cheap.  No,  it's not cheap.  It's kind of a little bit unfair and it's also not always 100% foolproof.  You know,  they're experts,  but then it's not the end line.  It's all people.  It's a good way to kind of size up what you got and try to put it on somewhat of a playing field where people understand what they have.  But sometimes it's a little bit, 
[02:13:30]  it's a little weird.  Is there anything you,  I was going to ask about like notorious stuff,  like the OJ,  something like that.  How about Sandusky?  You got any Sandusky stuff?  I stay away from it.  You know,  yeah,  yeah,  I stay,  I personally stay away from it just because I just,  I feel like it's just,  you know,  it doesn't feel right.  Like people always say,  you know,  can you get me Derek Jeter's bubble gum?  I'm like,  no.  Yeah.  But you know,  it's,  but you know,  it probably would sell,  you know,  that's how sick and crazy it is.  I bet you you got Ted Williams head,  you know,  Ted Williams head is freeze,  freeze dried. 
[02:14:00]  I stay away from all the,  you know,  this ghoulish stuff,  the body parts.  What do you think of Ted Williams son making him sign,  you know,  all sorts of shit day in and day out at the end of his life?  Well,  you know,  we went,  we,  we had a,  we had a relationship with Ted and his son.  His son was definitely a little bit on the different side to say the least.  He was weird,  but we went down and saw Ted.  We had a great relationship with Ted.  You know,  I don't know.  You know,  his son was one of those kids that if you wanted to say,  you know,  if you're a celebrity,  how difficult is it sometimes to raising your kids, 
[02:14:30]  you know,  with you being such a big name and big celebrity,  he was a prime example of that.  We did very well with it.  You know,  you know,  it's funny how Ted has not like,  you know,  Mickey Mantle and certain big names have gone through the roof,  you know,  years after they passed,  but not him.  And that's odd to me that I don't know if it's because he signed so much.  And his son definitely put a little dent in,  in,  you know,  in his legacy,  I think.  But in dealing with his son,  he was different.  You know,  we,  we went through many years at the end. 
[02:15:00]  We actually had a very good relationship there.  Yeah.  You know,  it's wasn't easy,  but we,  we put together a nice collection.  I told my friends too,  when Ted was getting,  we couldn't sign certain things.  I said,  you know,  just buy 10 of these bats,  buy 10 of these jerseys.  And it would have been worth a lot of money,  but none of them ever listened to me.  Yeah.  There's a guy saying that,  uh,  he wants to know how much a baseball signed by Garrick and Ruth is.  Does that exist even?  I don't know.  Yes.  Let me see if this guy has one.  Jason,  you got that.  Yep.  And it's,  uh,  my grandfather got it from my dad. 
[02:15:30]  It's still,  you know,  it has the,  uh,  the green and red stitches on the baseball.  I mean,  it's,  you know,  it's slightly faded,  but it's still in pretty good shape.  You can clearly see Ruth and Garrick signature on it in pen.  Some people love that ball.  Some people don't.  They like,  they want to have the individual ball of each player.  Oh my God.  But that's still,  that could,  you know,  I have to see the ball without seeing it.  That could easily be a 20,  $25,000 ball.  What's the most valuable ball?  Cause I would have thought that would have gotten a lot more money.  Yeah,  I would have thought.  And it's fading.  And a lot of times,  you know,  the individual Primo Ruth ball could go all the way up to 60, 
[02:16:00]  $70,000.  Probably one of the better balls.  I've seen a Babe Ruth ball go as much as a hundred,  you know,  so every now and then you see that.  I haven't,  I haven't seen too many other balls,  you know,  go for,  go for that.  I'd love to get an Obama to do a signing.  I tried.  I tried really hard,  you know,  figuring that'd be a way to help fundraise,  whatever,  because you know,  that'd be,  that'd be a cool item to have.  I was feeling maybe it's the middle of January.  You might be able to get them.  Hey Jason,  you selling that thing?  No, 
[02:16:30]  no,  I don't have any plans.  Looking upon it or sell it?  Well,  I got to frame it.  Yeah,  yeah.  It's going to take,  so I'll give you 20 bucks.  Well,  Jason,  let me know,  because certainly we're on Steiner Sports.  We could put that on our auction and we'll certainly turn that over for you.  No problem.  How do we contact you,  Brandon?  You'll see it,  you'll see it on my Facebook.  If you go to Brandon Steiner on my Facebook,  even on my website,  BrandonSteiner.com,  you'll,  you'll see the information and contacts.  This guy,  thanks.  This guy has a baseball from 1952,  Jackie Robinson.  By himself or? 
[02:17:00]  John,  what do you got?  Oh,  I have the,  it's actually the whole team signed.  Love that.  Jackie Robinson,  Duke,  Snyder,  Pee Wee Reese.  I had no idea how much,  something like that.  Well,  first of all,  that Brooklyn Dodger era is notorious for the locker room signature.  You know,  the locker room guy signing it,  but assuming that's a real ball and all the signatures are real,  you're probably looking at three to $4,000 for that ball.  Right.  I would,  I would have thought more.  Yeah.  I feel like you could get more.  The problem with the,  the problem with the ball is it's just hard to find as the Brooklyn Dodger fans, 
[02:17:30]  unfortunately are dying off.  It's hard to,  hard to find.  There's not new fans necessarily for that.  So,  you know,  that,  that baby boomer,  really,  it's a late baby,  early,  early baby boomer.  They're kind of gone.  So the Brooklyn Dodger thing is for you to say.  Are you low balling these people,  Brandon?  No,  not at all.  What do you mean?  You know what?  That's a good point.  Ruth and Gary,  look,  you might get 75 for it,  but I'll take it off your head.  $50.  Yeah.  I know before I go,  I'm going to get those tennis balls signed by you guys. 
[02:18:00]  See where I go.  See where I go.  I saw his hand was shaking when that guy called with the,  I know he actually slobbered.  You didn't see that,  but he drool came out.  The drool came out a little bit with the Gary Groot ball.  You know,  it's like,  need that ball.  Yeah.  What's that?  What about the,  the Honus Wagner?  You don't have any of those.  I mean,  they come and go.  I mean,  you know,  no,  I don't have any of them,  but what are they worth these days?  That,  that number always goes.  I don't know.  I mean,  and I've seen it drop down.  Yeah.  I mean,  but I've seen it drop down now.  So I stay away from that kind of thing just because too much hype.  Do you think this new e-graphs market is, 
[02:18:30]  is viable?  I think it's bullshit.  Frankly,  you know,  I think it's bullshit.  It's basically where you order online,  a facsimile autograph.  I don't get it.  Some players,  you know,  personalize it with like,  they'll record something for you.  And you can play it off your computer.  Oh,  it's kind of,  I got it.  I got a really good one for you,  Brandon,  by the way,  the name of the book is you got to have balls.  John,  what do you got?  Listen to this one.  I appreciate you taking my call. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  Back in the late seventies,  I had a neighbor,  an older guy.  He did something with the Met.  He took me to the stadium and sat a room and some of the ball players came out and signed  the ball.  And I really don't remember who they were.  I don't know where I would go to find who they were,  but the main question is,  uh,  this older elderly African-American gentleman was there.  And,  um,  the guy I was with said,  do you want to go have your ball signed by him?  And I did.  And after he signed,  I looked at it was Willie Mays. 
[02:19:30]  My question is,  is I was young and not thinking,  right?  And I ended up signing the ball myself.  Ah!  Oh boy.  Why?  Does that totally screw the value on that now?  Yeah.  Does the,  does the word asshole mess up a Willie Mays ball?  I think your,  I think your kids will appreciate it.  You know,  something that's good.  Oh man.  What,  what would a Willie Mays ball go for?  A Willie Mays ball sell for about $250,  $300.  That's it.  Yeah.  About 300 bucks.  Okay.  Yeah. 
[02:20:00]  But now that he signed it,  what?  $1.50?  Depends on what's your name,  sir.  That,  that didn't,  yeah.  I don't know if I should try to bleach it out or.  No,  don't bleach it.  Is there a way to take the angle off the ball?  What you're going to do there is if you really want to get creative is you cut,  you cut the ball up and you take that piece off and then you put it underneath,  let's say a photo of the game you were at or something like that.  I would actually cut that ball and cut the skin off the ball.  And then you'd have the Willie Mays autograph and you'd put that underneath the photo.  You'd have kind of.  That's a great idea.  Is there a way to get.  I think.  Been down that road before. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  If that was a valuable ball,  like a five or 10,000 or $30,000 ball,  is there a way to get an extra marking off it with laser?  Cause they can take tattoos off.  It's very,  very difficult without damaging the ball and looking like something happened to the  ball.  You can always try.  There's ink remover.  There's all different things,  but on a ball,  it's tough.  It's very hard on an actual on a baseball to remove that.  What about the other players at the time?  How can I figure out who they were?  What you do is you take a picture,  you know,  about four or five different pictures from some different angles.  You go to my Facebook, 
[02:21:00]  you'll send me that.  And I'll tell you who's on the ball.  I'm pretty familiar with that particular ball for the most part,  having done some stuff with that team.  So I'll pretty much recognize most of the autographs.  Is there anything you have that you wouldn't sell?  Like that you just personally love too much and you just couldn't.  I've got a few things that are,  I mean my collection,  it's,  it's awesome,  but it's not one of those,  you know,  you're going to find every,  you know,  Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth jerseys,  but I have a couple of things that are just priceless to me.  The first collectible I created,  believe it or not,  was I was on the train. 
[02:21:30]  I was looking at the back of the daily news.  I saw Mark Messia holding up a couple and immediately I wasn't in the  collectible business.  I was just doing the marketing of players.  And I just said,  you know,  we did it.  I know 15,000 people that want to buy that photo.  I got to get Mark to do this.  And he signed that,  you know,  two brands,  it's a simple collectible,  but I would never sell that because that was the beginning of obviously a  very strong run for me.  And the other thing is I went to Mariano's house.  I was talking about the show I do on yes.  So I go to his house.  I got the cameras,  two cameras,  Mariano would do an interview about your collectibles. 
[02:22:00]  Yes.  I don't have anything.  I said,  I told you I was coming.  Are you,  are you crazy?  So he goes to the camera guy.  Actually,  he had a box of tapes at that time.  They still use tapes.  And he takes the box and cuts it into his glove.  Actually,  it's on my,  if you go on,  uh,  on YouTube,  you see,  there's a video of this and he actually takes a knife and cuts the box up.  And that's his glove.  He goes,  this was my glove growing up as a kid.  And you see the way he actually took that glove and started shaping it.  And then he signed it.  He put it in his pocket.  Like you can see that was very instinctive for him.  And it was very humbling to me at that. 
[02:22:30]  I just remember that just one of my favorite things.  And I happen to hold on to that.  Um,  and the other thing is I have all my ticket stuff since I'm a kid.  I mean,  it's literally since I'm a teenager,  um,  my concerts,  everything.  And I wouldn't give that up.  I mean,  that was all my,  my memories of going to all these events.  I'm the same.  It's like basically collectors like this are,  and I am one,  but organized hoarding is all it really is.  There's something about capturing the moment and keeping it.  And I never do it for financial gain.  I don't know why I love this stuff.  You know, 
[02:23:00]  you know what I do for a living?  I help people extend the memories.  Like I figured in your fab five,  you got the marriage,  your birth to your kids,  and then you got a sports moment,  probably somewhere in there.  And it's like,  I'm going to go extend one of the,  one of your favorite moments in your lives by creating some products with  some of these players or finding the actual products from that particular  moment.  And let's put that up on your wall.  Why not relive that moment every day when you wake up,  why not relive it in your office or in your,  in your room,  whatever it is.  How did this guy make it to the major leagues playing baseball with a  cardboard glove? 
[02:23:30]  Oh,  you're watching the video on YouTube.  Yeah.  Oh,  it's unbelievable.  I love this.  And he's authentic when he does this video.  You can see that's Mariano.  Oh wow.  Making a glove out of,  out of cardboard.  Oh,  is that what you meant?  Cut a box.  Yeah.  He cut a box.  Oh,  you see how he's got his majors.  And that's why his hands are so soft.  I mean,  that's why he's such a good.  That's pretty amazing.  That really is.  Yeah.  And that's all you,  that's all you would need.  It wouldn't hurt your hand.  That was what he played with as a kid.  Yes.  Wow. 
[02:24:00]  And he also,  you know,  string and rubber bands,  but he uses a ball.  That's amazing.  Really?  Somebody's begging me to ask about the 1941 play ball set with Vandy and Joe DiMaggio.  Who's Vandy?  I don't know.  Vandermeer?  Vandermeer?  Maybe.  I don't know.  I'm not familiar with that.  Okay.  Sorry about that.  Yeah,  it's okay.  You think you couldn't get Lance Armstrong because he thought your book was an insult?  Right?  Jesus.  His book,  of course,  you've got to have balls. 
[02:24:30]  I should send him a copy.  You know,  but if you're,  you know,  the book is about collecting.  It's about a lot of different things,  but it is about selling.  It is about,  you know,  just trying to take what you have and make it better.  And that's like my main theory behind.  I never really asked.  I wasn't one of the smarter kids in my class.  I don't know how the hell I got into Syracuse.  I had no grades,  shitty SAT scores,  and zero money.  But,  you know,  I had a lot of heart,  and I took whatever I had and made it work.  Like the dirt. 
[02:25:00]  It's like,  you know,  things got a little tough.  The dirt was on the field.  There was a lot of it.  We made the most of it.  You know,  I lifted the grass up on that last field.  Almost a million dollars of sales.  You know,  just freeze dried it.  It's just simple stuff.  You're worth a few bucks.  Crazy.  I've done all right,  you know,  considering how little I was worth growing up.  I mean,  you know,  I still open up the refrigerator.  I'm like,  shit,  I can't believe how much food is in here.  It's crazy.  I need a Dan Marino,  and for myself,  Pete Maravich.  What do you got?  Well,  I'll tell you, 
[02:25:30]  Pete Maravich is one of my favorites.  I have a couple in my sports room,  one of my favorites,  something I wouldn't give up.  Dan Marino's coming up and signing for us,  I think in a few weeks,  at our Steiner store on Roosevelt Field.  You're going to give me one of those.  Yeah,  I have to hook you up with a Dan Marino,  a case.  No,  that's all right.  You need the case.  You need it.  I can't believe that's right.  No,  you need the Cheater Bowl on the case.  I don't care about you.  Yeah,  and then you need some boxing glove cases.  Yeah.  Yeah,  the ones that I could put where I'm worried about the light is fucking up the autograph.  I got Ali to sign a glove recently,  which I'd never sell. 
[02:26:00]  You got to take care of this stuff.  Yeah,  I want it to look good.  So when my children are born,  I can go,  you'll never get this,  you little prick.  And I can sell it and use the money for product.  At least my kids says,  I don't want the shit.  Dad,  I don't want it.  Don't bring it home.  I don't want it.  And I was dumb because I wanted to bring in,  I supposedly have a Kurt Cobain autograph.  I wanted you to look at it and see what you think by eyeing it.  All right,  bring it in.  Next time.  You think?  We'll send a photo of it.  You can probably send a photo.  If you send a photo.  It's a signed photo.  Dr.  Steve sent it to me. 
[02:26:30]  A guy that seems,  seems,  he's a friend of ours.  So I think he,  I think he thinks it's real.  You got to protect where you collect.  I'll tell you the stuff you get in person,  there's nothing like it.  And it's,  it's always should be the joy and the center of your collection.  You just got the memory to go along with it.  When you,  I'm sorry,  when you get like something like a two glove case like that,  do you,  is there a way it doesn't damage the glove at all?  Right.  When you put it,  they don't like stitch it into anything.  That's one of the cases,  but I would send you even something simpler.  That's,  that's a case you can hang on the wall, 
[02:27:00]  but there's another case you can just put on your table.  I'm a big fan of protecting what you collect.  We have a whole line of things,  whether it be framing or cases on our website,  but you know,  for the,  if you want to put that on a table,  there's a glass case that I would highly recommend.  That's not what you're looking at on our website that I put the gloves in.  That's what I keep my gloves in.  And you know,  it's,  you got to protect where you collect.  And you got to,  you know,  a lot of people have this stuff.  It's under their bed.  It's in their closet.  I mean,  what good is that doing?  I got it in my closet and waterproof things.  Do you have anything for UFC gloves? 
[02:27:30]  Like those are,  Oh,  okay.  See that.  I don't know how to display those.  I mean,  we have quite a bit of cases.  He needs a huge house.  Dude,  you got to see his apartment waterproof.  They're afraid of a flood on the 50th floor.  No,  but what if somebody,  what if somebody above me all of a sudden has a toilet leak and all,  it goes all over my gloves above your Pavarotti.  Well,  what if I'm sitting next to somebody who I think is my friend and they throw  water and it gets all over my gloves?  All right.  That could happen.  Oh,  this was awesome. 
[02:28:00]  Uh,  Brian.  My pleasure.  You're going to have to come back and see us.  We got to give away some stuff next time too.  You know,  let's give away something.  What do you got?  Trying to think what we're doing.  You know,  we're doing something with magic Johnson today.  A sign.  So let's give away a basketball side by magic or something.  He's got big balls.  A basketball by magic.  Jesus.  He didn't touch it.  He didn't sit on it,  did he?  You know,  I'll tell you magic.  Magic's my favorite though.  My all time favorite.  What a great,  great player.  I'm hanging up on everyone so we can start over.  So what do you want to do?  You got to make it official.  The book is called, 
[02:28:30]  by the way,  you got to have balls.  Brandon's autobiography.  And I'm sure there's a lot of stuff about collecting in here.  And it's,  yeah,  how should we give away the,  well,  Brandon,  what caller gets it?  Let's do it for these third caller.  Third caller gets a what now?  Gets a signed magic Johnson basketball.  You just want a signed magic Johnson basketball,  sir.  I'm actually trying to dial quickly.  You,  sir.  What's your name?  Yes,  sir.  Hi,  what's your name?  Barry.  Hi,  Barry.  Are you calling in for the ball?  Yeah.  Yeah,  but Jimmy, 
[02:29:00]  is this Jim?  Yes,  this is Jim.  I'm trying to call in.  I got a Maravich basketball.  I'd like to know how much it's worth.  Wow.  How's the signature?  Did he sign it just pistol?  Or did he sign his whole name?  No,  it's just got Pete Maravich on it.  Well,  he signed it pistol Pete.  Write Brandon,  tell him.  He could have,  sometimes he writes pistol on there.  Most of the time he wrote pistol.  I got a lot of pistol Pete.  A lot of pistol.  We should talk.  If you take a picture of that,  you know,  put that,  send it to me on my Facebook,  or if you go to brandonsteiner.com. 
[02:29:30]  By the way,  brandonsteiner.com,  the blog is very out of the box.  If you want to go and register for it,  it's free.  But also,  you can get my book on brandonsteiner.com as well.  The book is not just all collectible,  so if you're not a big collectible fan,  you'll like the book.  It's just a kid from Brooklyn.  I just talked about how I got here at this point.  Growing up in Brooklyn for how many pages?  52.  So be prepared for the 52 yard.  You know,  get some tissues out.  He was listening to that shit.  You know,  yeah,  I was,  I was there and poor. 
[02:30:00]  It didn't have much.  My mother laughed and my dad died.  It's true though.  It was,  it wasn't actually all that pretty.  It doesn't happen to everybody.  We've all heard that story before,  but this was a little bit creative.  What's your name again,  sir?  Cause you do win the Magic Johnson basketball.  It's Barry.  Jimmy,  Jimmy,  WIP was talking about him this morning in Philly.  He's doing,  I guess,  doing a plug or something.  Who gives a fuck?  Do you like the basketball or not?  Yeah.  He's plugging my date in Philly.  Thank you.  Yeah. 
[02:30:30]  I want the ball.  All right.  Well,  say on hold.  We'll give your address and we'll get that to Brandon.  Yeah.  Line three.  Jimmy is playing the helium comedy club all weekend in Philly.  That's terrific.  Yeah.  Why?  I don't put Brandon in here.  We're not talking about my shows all being sold out except for Sunday.  Why would we talk about that?  It's not important.  That's awesome.  How do you get on?  How do you get on the radio and be able to curse and say whatever the hell you want?  Satellite subscription.  It's amazing.  What a gig.  This is a great country.  I love it.  It's the best.  Yeah.  A lot better than a regular radio.  We want to know how we could sell dirt for $25 million.  I know.  You want to trade jobs? 
[02:31:00]  I'll sell fucking dirt all day long.  And underneath that dirt, there's more dirt.  Hey, sir.  More dirt.  I got a really good question for you.  Maybe off air.  An Opie and Anthony collectible for real buckaroos.  Oh, Jesus.  You know what's crazy is?  Real bucks.  We found the right product for the two of you guys.  Yeah.  You know,  there's probably a fan base out there who want a couple of things to put on.  People probably live and die with you every morning.  I know what people would want.  And they're suicide notes.  Maybe we get an O&A and Jim Norton collectible.  So if you manage to get past the first 52 pages, you've got to have balls. 
[02:31:30]  I mean, you know, I'd love to hear your feedback, though.  The book is a good book, though.  Hopefully you give it a read.  And, you know, it's great to be back up here in Sirius.  You know, I had my own show for about a year and a half up here in the afternoons until  Mad Dog came in and took over, and, you know, we kind of moved on.  I moved over to another station.  But I love this place.  It's so creative, and there's always stuff going on up here.  So I've become a big Sirius fan.  Yeah, yeah.  The bands and...  Does that still happen?  Yeah, they still have live performance. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, the bands and you guys and Howard Stern and all these different things going on.  Sure.  Right on, Brandon.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Hey, great, great, great.  Brandon Steiner, you've got to have balls.  The book looks like it's going to be a good read.  So check it out.  And the Facebook and all that again, one last time.  Well, how are you going?  It's Brandon Steiner on Facebook.  Go to BrandonSteiner.com.  You get all the information.  You can register for my blog.  Everything links.  If you Google anything right now, it brings up Facebook, Twitter, all the information.  We have a lot of contests on my Facebook.  I give away a lot of cool shit.  I just gave away a $500 gift card for your greatest sports moment. 
[02:32:30]  You know, you'd be crying listening to those moments.  You know, your first time at Yankee Stadium, all that stuff.  And then you do the What's It Worth on the Facebook.  So you can mail in your pictures, and I tell you what it's worth.  Okay.  It's all good.  Thank you, buddy.  Hey, thank you.  It's been fun.  Amy Schumer coming up next.  This is the OPN Anthony Channel.  Excuse me.  I lost my road.  Please help me.  On Sirius XM.  New to Sirius XM's fantasy football show. 
[02:33:00]  It's the Jim Florentine Show.  Putting the fun back in fantasy football.  Nothing exciting about fantasy football.  It's fucking guys in khakis and button-downs watching football.  They bring their laptops to a fucking sports bar to come over.  Who just scored that touchdown?  I go, why?  I got them on my team.  Fuck you.  Go in the ladies' room and take a piss.  It's Jim Florentine.  And your calls.  Talking everything fantasy football.  Hey, Jim.  What's the best way to keep up with your team while the game is on?  Nobody watches fucking football with a laptop open. 
[02:33:30]  Nobody.  You have a fucking case of beer and some sandwiches.  And you're talking about fucking getting a handjob from a stripper in the door of the commercials.  From the night before.  Hey, man.  You know all your listeners love fantasy football?  I don't give a shit.  No fucking manly men play fantasy football.  We aren't even sure why we hired him.  Seems underproductive.  And we're gonna open our fucking laptops and our iPads.  And we're gonna have a draft.  Who are you gonna take?  How about take it in the ass, you fucking homos?  Or you fucking fantasy football?  It's just nerdness. 
[02:34:00]  The Jim Florentine Show on Sirius XM's fantasy football channel.  Go into ladies' room and take a piss.  Robert De Niro.  It's not what you say.  It's what he sees.  In his directorial debut.  We can't accept that.  Starring Chaz Palminteri.  I didn't give it to you.  I gave it to your son.  And Rich Voss.  Louie, fiends.  I want my money.  A bronc.  Tail.  Fiends, you can't dodge me forever.  Come on.  What are you doing about?  What are you yelling about, huh?  John, I got a problem with this guy over here. 
[02:34:30]  Louie Beans.  This guy owes me 20, and it's been two weeks now.  And every time he sees me, he keeps dodging me, John.  Should I crack him one or what?  The struggle of an idiotic Jewish comedian.  Stammering his way through a few lines of film dialogue with a genuine Hollywood actor.  Listen, see, sometimes violence is not the answer.  Is he a good friend of yours or not?  Nah, John, I don't even like him.  Well, there's your answer right there.  Look at it this way.  It costs you $20 to get rid of him.  He's never going to ask you for money again. 
[02:35:00]  He's never going to bother you again.  He's out of your life for $20.  Come on.  You got to have cheap.  You're right, John.  You're always right.  A bronc.  Tail.  How do you know the right ass all the time, Johnny?  Well, I try to keep my eyes and ears open all the time.  And I read.  You read?  Yeah, I read.  Come on.  Come on.  Let's go to Mario's next door and get something.  See?  3XM.  The Opinion 3 Show. 
[02:35:30]  Amy Schumer in studio.  Good morning.  Making her wait so we can talk to Brandon Steiner.  So we have to start with an apology again.  I could have talked sports with you guys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or literal Amy, as we call her.  Yes, yes, yes.  Why?  What happened?  What did I miss?  This is why I love Amy.  Amy Twittered something.  I Twittered a photo.  Oh, I did see that yesterday.  Amy is promoting a couple of dates, and she did a film with Parker Posey, which was funny. 
[02:36:00]  Amy was great.  She's a really good actress.  You really were good in the film.  It annoyed me that my friend is obviously going very far.  And there's a screen cap.  I just took a picture of Amy Parker, and there's a black girl in the middle.  So I Twittered a photo.  See, I'm watching Amy in a movie, and she's the one in the middle.  And Amy Twittered as a goof, Jimmy, no, I'm not in the middle, which of course was...  Just explaining that that wasn't me.  That was a black chick, and not me.  Yeah, you were joking.  You were just being a silly goose, as you will tend to be. 
[02:36:30]  Now, hold on one second.  Let me see Jim's profile.  So I Twittered back...  Would that be Jim Norton on Twitter?  It would be Jim Norton on Twitter.  Jim Norton.  So I Twittered back Amy's with a response.  You were, Jimmy, no, I'm not in the middle.  And I wrote back, way to play along, exclamation point, LOL.  Remind me to never use you as an alibi, LOL, rolling on floor laughing.  Yes.  And what text do I get?  Oh, shut up.  Everyone was tweeting me like, Amy, you idiot. 
[02:37:00]  No, no, no.  It was good.  I get this...  Oh, where is it?  Do you really think I didn't know you were joking?  Well, everyone else didn't.  They thought you were just being silly.  I know.  Literal Amy.  Literal Amy.  I would never write LOL, R-O-F-L and mean it.  Like, I would never use you as an alibi.  Oh, I don't know.  I'm humiliated that you would think I would write something so awful.  Well, I should have given you the benefit of the doubt, but I did not. 
[02:37:30]  Confused with Colin.  I just thought you were going through a weird, you know, I'm like, maybe he's dating someone  and she uses this AOL speak.  I'm dating somebody in their late 40s.  Amy's got a lot of dates coming up.  Oh, gosh.  Lovity Live's a cool club.  Yeah, I'm excited.  I'm excited this weekend.  Starting today, Thursday through Saturday, Lovity Live in West Nyack, New York.  Really cool club.  I'm just going to get up there and I'm just going to tell these people my jokes and just  like, hope they laugh at them, you know, just get up there. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  That's the plan.  That's a good plan.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And Governors, December 8th and 9th.  Oh, nice.  And they had a Sunday show.  That's cool.  Keeping it local.  I haven't been to Governors in a while.  That's pretty cool.  I got to get over there.  You got to get out there.  That's like my hometown.  Uh-huh.  You better go.  My hometown.  You better be there, girl.  Hells yeah.  And then the sold out anti-social you're doing with Jim Norton.  You know it.  I want to go to that so bad.  We should do more of those because that was sold out relatively quickly. 
[02:38:30]  That is exciting.  That's a good grouping.  I can't wait.  I'm headlining that, right?  I close the show.  Oh, man.  Everyone would love you to.  Oh, my God.  That's the big fucking argument with me and Attela every time.  Like, you know, he's like, do you want to close?  I'm like, no.  You close.  Really?  I refuse to go on after either of you ever.  Me, you could follow easily.  Attela's harder to follow because he's so...  Like, he's a brilliant act, but he's so offbeat and he can be completely filthy or he can be 
[02:39:00]  completely clean and it's just, it's always bizarre and funny and it's really hard to go  up and do anything after that because, like, I just want to watch him.  I don't want to watch me after Attela.  No, he goes up and absolutely slaughters and doesn't feel a second of it.  No, he's just...  And he'll be like, well, they whatever.  Hating his own guts all the time.  I'm like, they're all in agony because of what you just did and he doesn't feel it.  Yeah.  He had, like, a really awful long beard and he looked like a fucking terrorist.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I saw him with that beard.  It's terrible.  And he just made me laugh so hard. 
[02:39:30]  He goes, you know what goes good with this beard?  Kaboom.  Kaboom.  He's so fucking funny.  I love it when he goes on stage with that facial hair, a snow hat, a coat, and they'll  be holding shopping bags.  You're like, wow, how are you not homeless?  What's he doing?  Yeah, he looks like a homeless guy.  He'll have his coffee up there.  It looks like somebody's going to put money in it.  Yeah.  He's truly, he's one of the absolute greats to ever perform.  I mean, he's so fucking great. 
[02:40:00]  He's probably mine, too.  I would say David Tell's probably my favorite comedy.  Do you know his mom used to take care of me and my sister after school?  What?  I remember growing up.  Is that the weirdest thing?  That is strange.  Yeah.  Tell the story.  What's that about?  Well, we were latchkey kids, and I never knew Dave at all.  He was already out of the house, I guess.  Maybe you just blocked it out.  Maybe you knew him very well.  I didn't know Dave, but I knew his hands.  Something about his smell.  Yes, and I would feel myself being penetrated while staring at a gnome hat. 
[02:40:30]  No, but we grew up in the same town, and his mom was our baby.  Me and my sister, she took care of us.  She made us mac and cheese.  How weird is that?  It's so weird.  And then we didn't realize it until years later.  We were both doing a show at Central Park Summer Stage, and his sister was like, Amy, I used to babysit you.  Come on.  And we were like, what?  It was so weird.  Yeah.  And he just found a book of mine from when I was a little girl, and his mom just found it, and they mailed it to me. 
[02:41:00]  He was like, get ready to shit yourself.  What do you mean a book of yours?  A book.  Like a book I must have brought over after school.  How to sleep on your stomach.  I was going to say, test it for DNA immediately.  Immediately.  How to breathe through your nose.  Amy, you're blowing up, man.  Yes.  That's why I keep trying to you.  When is your show premiere?  That's not nice to say.  April 30th.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  Okay, so until you get some time.  No, I'm, you know what, I'm thin right now.  Here's why.  I did a photo shoot for Vanity Fair yesterday. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, good.  So I didn't eat, like, I ate like you're supposed to eat all week.  Yeah.  Like girls eat that are on television, like what I should be doing all the time.  It was the worst week.  Have you ever tried to, like, lose weight?  It's so awful.  I don't know how anyone can live like that for...  It was like you were conscious of it all the time?  It was like...  You didn't crave everything.  Just vegetables and, like, some protein.  Oh, it was a miserable...  I was like, that's why models are such cunts, because they're just, like, starving.  They're just always hungry.  Yeah, and then I revenge ate and drank. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  For 24 hours.  Nice.  Oh, you made weight.  Yeah.  I got myself back up.  She made weight, and then it's like, okay, now I can eat.  I'm ready to fight again.  Yeah.  I don't know.  When, uh, 4th of July, that party, you were in that fucking bikini there.  Yeah?  You were looking pretty goddamn good.  Okay.  That's nice to hear.  Goddamn good.  Yeah.  Television adds 90 pounds.  Does it?  Oh, boy.  It does.  And I look like a cabbage patch anyway, so.  And I was like, that's not fair.  You just upset Jimmy.  Jimmy's gonna throw up.  Yeah.  Jimmy's, uh, Jimmy's out of here. 
[02:42:30]  Sorry, Jimmy.  He left.  Jimmy's doing it.  Yeah.  It was, ugh.  Not eating, it's, I mean, it sucks.  So is that your first fucking foray into how you're gonna turn all Hollywood and shit?  No.  Oh, my God.  An eating disorder would be great.  Never.  I would love to, like...  You know, I'm not someone that, I don't think I'm someone that would look...  Like, you know when girls lose all that weight, you're like, we didn't need you  to do that, Christina Ricci.  Yeah, yeah.  Jennifer Goodwin, like, have a sandwich.  Nobody needs you to be a wife.  I'd love for you to get to the point where you're checking out at the supermarket and  you look over at the tabloids and there's, like, Amy just emaciated, getting her mail 
[02:43:00]  from the fucking, like, the mailbox looking at the camera and got all mad.  With the headline, what happened to Amy?  Yeah, yeah.  And I'm just, I thought this is what you wanted.  Family's worried about Amy Schumer.  Skeleton.  Or good cellulite picture with a whole bunch of Hollywood babes.  Oh, I can give them that right now.  I'll take that right now.  That one's always my favorite where they just show the cellulite and you have to guess whose  ass it's on.  Whose cellulite is this?  Yeah, whose body it's on.  They're just like us.  I'm a fucking prick, man. 
[02:43:30]  I know it.  But, like, that is really just, that's got to kill people.  It's like going, oh, whose ass is this?  Whose disgusting ass is in our magazine?  And here are the names, the little key with A is, you know, if those people are looking,  you've got to be like, oh, man.  That sucks.  But who are the people that buy those magazines mostly?  The people I see on planes, it's these fat chicks from the Midwest who are wearing a sweatshirt  over a turtleneck, you know, and mom haircut, terrible jeans, and they're like, she looks 
[02:44:00]  stupid in this Gucci dress.  And you're like, really?  Like, you know you're going home alone.  You have a ton of cats to feed.  They're cats, yeah.  She's going home to her cats.  But you think Brittany has taken a turn for the worse, you know?  Everything she owns is covered with hair and stinks like piss.  Yeah.  Nice.  Nice.  Her exposure will be on hoarders and nothing else.  Yeah.  Yeah, so you're like, I don't know, you're right on that fucking Hollywood thing there, 
[02:44:30]  Amy.  We've seen this a lot.  Really?  Man.  So we just want to like soak you in before you just say those.  Soak me in.  God, I remember that.  That's what I say while I'm fucking.  Remember when Amy used to do the show?  I just keep going, soak me in.  Soak me in.  Guys love it.  They're like, that doesn't make any sense.  I'm like, shut up.  I mush their face.  Soak me in.  Are we setting another one free today?  I don't know.  I think so.  So many people that used to do our show.  Remember when they used to do our show?  Who?  Like who?  Remember when Louis C.K. used to beg to come on?  Remember when Louis C.K. did our show?  Doesn't he still do it? 
[02:45:00]  Oh, he'll come on at his leisure.  Right.  He'll get to us eventually.  And that's it.  The eventually is getting further apart each time.  Further apart, yes.  Sure.  Now hosting SNL.  I'm happy for him.  And him and the tabloids are taking pictures of him in his stalled out boat.  Yeah.  In the middle of the boat.  Like he's fucking goddamn Aristotle Onassis.  Well, he loves boat.  Oh, he loves boat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It stalled out.  Oh, God.  I really want to.  It did?  Yeah.  What happened?  And that pictures of him like beached on the boat trying to start it.  On a cell phone just waiting for help. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  Waiting for help.  And his daughters.  He's using his Emmys to try and row back in.  That's great.  Yeah.  Guy, I'm going to throw you this line.  Right.  I tied my Emmy to it.  Catch.  Why are you using it as an anchor?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're like, it's too much weight.  You have to throw the Emmys overboard.  No.  He's like, no.  I'm going down with the ship.  He's throwing his children overboard instead.  No.  But I could see him.  Yeah.  I could see him throwing his Emmys in the river.  Yeah.  I really could.  I could see that.  Yeah.  You would do it.  That's something that Louis would do.  But then a week later, he'd be in scuba gear. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  I don't want to get that shit.  I don't know why I did that.  I shouldn't have done that.  I'm stupid.  I could use this.  An idiot.  You think he'll do well on SNL?  I think so.  I can't wait to see him on there.  I can't wait to see what he does with it because SNL is not a show I watch anymore.  I still watch it.  But knowing Louis is going to be fucking hosting, I can't wait.  Yeah.  That's going to be crazy.  You still watch SNL?  Oh.  I watch it just force a habit.  Did they call you?  I'm sorry.  What?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What?  She's defending SNL.  No, I'm not.  I'm not.  But I still watch it as force a habit. 
[02:46:30]  Do you like it still?  The laughs for me are few and far between.  Yeah.  But yeah, it just still makes me excited to hear somebody say live from New York it's  Saturday night.  That was my favorite growing up.  Well, we always have that hope that it's going to be good again.  I know.  But I do like a lot of the people on there.  They make me laugh.  But just, yeah.  I don't know why it's sort of...  It's kind of just a fixture now.  Yeah.  It's just there.  Kind of comfortable.  It's comfortable.  I think it's the work schedule that fucks up that show.  Yeah.  Where they have to get all that together in one week. 
[02:47:00]  Those poor people.  I just...  It doesn't seem appealing to...  They're sleep deprived.  I don't know.  It used to work back in the day, but...  Because everybody was fueled by like drugs and stuff.  Exactly.  But they're all just like...  And now they got human resources over there, I'm sure.  Where the lady's like, look, these guys can only work eight hours at a time, not 28  hours in a row.  Yeah.  You're right.  They work...  They're not people that my friends who've worked there.  They just...  They do not have lives while they're there.  It's bad.  Everyone we've talked to that came out of there said it's a pretty tough life to do.  And there's always like little clicks and fights and infighting. 
[02:47:30]  Jim Brewer's SNL stories are the best.  Oh my God.  Jim Brewer's hilarious.  We got a few beers at him, man.  Oh no.  Just let him talk.  Let me tell you about that fucking asshole.  But you know, like, you think...  I remember you just think somebody's on there.  They're just rich.  You're like, okay, you're on that show once.  You're rich.  And then you'll see a lot of these guys that used to be on there, maybe a year or two,  and then they're back out on the road.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's just like, there's a sadness to it.  And there's...  I mean, that's great that they got to that level. 
[02:48:00]  I haven't been on that show, but you're just like, oh, we just thought you were rich.  I thought you were like, you were done and rich.  You think that's that?  I used to think Opie was rich when he was at BAB.  He was on the radio at BAB.  Yeah.  Yeah, see?  He showed me.  Me and I got together.  I'm like, hey, man, you got to come by my place.  Come by my house.  Figure some shit out.  I was like, fuck, because I was still in construction.  And all I'm thinking is like, he's fucking...  Iron Gates.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He had a pretty new blazer at the time and shit.  And you're just like, all right, kind of cool and shit. 
[02:48:30]  Forest green.  Kind of cool.  So, wow, he's inviting me to his house.  This is, like, fucking pretty cool.  Put on your Sunday shoes.  And he goes to Northport, which is a pretty nice neighborhood in Long Island.  So I'm pulling up and I make the turn away from the nice part of Northport to the other part.  Yeah, yeah.  And he pulls up in front of a house and I'm like, what are we, stopping somewhere?  We got to be...  Like, I'm following him in my shitty car.  Is this where you buy your drugs?  Yeah, yeah, this has to be, like, something.  And then all I... 
[02:49:00]  I just kept trying to convince myself.  I'm just saying to myself, it's got to be, like, his summer place or something.  You're just, like, saying at Northport, a second home or something.  And then I found out, no, no.  No.  You don't make any fucking money in radio.  Yeah.  It takes so much money to live well.  I'm, like, I have some money now and I still live, like, total dog shit.  Everyone increases that fucking little step, though.  We're never smart.  Yeah.  It's always like, like, oh, if I lived the lifestyle I was living with this money... 
[02:49:30]  Right.  ...I'm golden.  Uh-huh.  But then you always go, eh, I could buy that.  I can probably afford that now.  I'll step that up a little bit more and that and...  And then you're like, okay.  And then you make a little more money.  It's like, oh, good.  I could kick it up a little more.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If I was living like I was, knocking tin with fucking three roommates and shit.  You'd be wearing a suit with dollar signs all over it.  Yeah, it'd be great.  Yeah.  Money in the bank.  No.  Money, money, money.  I have two roommates right now.  So you're still a roommate, girl? 
[02:50:00]  Well, you saw my place.  It was, like, it's nice.  I wanted to see it.  Oh, yeah.  I saw the look you gave me.  You guys were with the child.  Sorry, I gave you the dirty look.  We were days out.  I know.  I wanted to go badly, too.  I wanted her to have the baby on my roof.  That was cool, though.  Yeah.  It was crazy.  I heard I missed a good one, too.  It was good.  It wound up being crazy.  Quest Love DJed.  Quest Love was fucking DJing.  On your roof?  On my roof.  Yeah, on the roof.  It was really fun.  Were the neighbors pissed?  No, I mean, we ran it out the roof. 
[02:50:30]  Oh, cool.  Very cool.  Damn, man.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah, but no, what happened was my friend Tig Notaro, who, Louie just promoted her album  on his website.  You can still get her album on Louie's website.  She got, she's one of the writers on my TV show.  She got diagnosed with breast cancer and was like, lives in LA and was like, I have breast  cancer.  And I was like, yeah, I was like, oh shit.  But I was like, we'll still move here.  Just like, we'll live together.  And her best friend, Kyle, who's also a writer on my show. 
[02:51:00]  And so they moved in with me.  And we, and Tig got both of her breasts removed.  So this is the show, right?  This is my, no.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, see, I thought it was the show.  And that's the show.  No.  This is reality.  This is real.  This is real.  She got her breasts removed.  She had a double mastectomy.  And the cancer is now totally gone.  She only has a 7% chance of recurrence.  So now I have these two 40 something year old roommates for no reason. 
[02:51:30]  Like she's totally healthy.  Like Kyle and I thought, I thought I was going to be like decorating her head scarves and like  holding a bin under her while she, she's healthier than anyone.  So now I just live, we just weirdly all live together.  So how long before you are right?  Look, um, well, they both live in LA and, uh, their contracts are kind of up on my show  in, uh, November.  So I think, you know, a couple of months, like maybe after the new year, I'll be like,  Hey, look, uh, Craigslist has a lot of new friendly listings. 
[02:52:00]  Uh, check this out.  Yeah.  But it's, it's fun.  They have bunk beds.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  It's fun for some reason.  It's like a little fucking like camp over there.  I know.  I know.  I can't have bunk beds as an adult.  They're doing it.  Hmm.  They almost got one with a slide to get down.  I like being that close to the ceiling for some reason.  Do you?  Yeah.  I kind of like it.  Oh, I don't know.  I always got the bottom bunk.  I was top bunk.  Yeah.  I'm a bottom bunk.  Tom and my brother had the bunk beds and I had the bottom bunk.  I liked it because my father could never get a good swing with his belt. 
[02:52:30]  And he was trying to fucking hit me with the belt.  Yeah.  It would like hit the top of the bunk.  He'd have to do some weird fucking sidearm pitch with the fucking, uh, with the belt to try  to get in there, but he could never get the leverage.  And Joe, on the other hand, was on the top bunk.  And when you're swinging top like that, that fucking thing would come and whip down on  him.  So Joe was getting the shit beat out of him.  Poor planning, Joe.  Ah, yeah.  I'm going to build a loft.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Like I'm back in college.  Levels.  Put a little couch under it.  Levels.  That's what it looks like. 
[02:53:00]  I want levels now, man.  Fuck this living like an adult crap.  Yeah.  It really is for shit.  What's the show about, by the way?  Um, it's, uh, it's called Inside Amy Schumer.  And it's just sort of like about, yeah, it's all, it's all just me interviewing cab drivers.  Do you regret telling that story on our show?  No, I don't.  They bring it up a lot.  I should, right?  Oh, please.  Every, every.  They bring it up a lot, these people.  How about every interview?  Like, I'll be getting interviewed in Vegas.  Some nice reporters, like, what's the cab story? 
[02:53:30]  People ask me to ask me about the cab story.  Someone just wrote, matter of fact, they saw you somewhere.  I think it was Charlotte.  Mm-hmm.  Were you in Charlotte recently?  I was just in Charlotte.  And they're like, Amy was hilarious in Charlotte, but she didn't tell the cab story.  When I say, does anyone have any requests?  Nine times out of ten, it's cab story.  Cab story.  I tell it.  All right, so you don't regret it.  I don't regret it.  I don't, I don't regret anything I've said on here yet.  Yet.  Yet.  Yeah. 
[02:54:00]  You gave Howard a lot of good dirt.  Yeah?  Yeah, man.  I don't hold out.  I would tell you guys anything.  I know.  We didn't ask the right questions, I guess.  Damn it.  When you were, uh, a comfort experience.  And people would fucking beat us up for it.  Like, why didn't you guys get the scoop on Amy and the wrestler?  Oh.  I remember at the time.  Oh, you knew I was dating him.  Yeah, at the time, you wanted it on the QT for a little bit.  Yes.  We kept it quiet.  Thank you.  But then you gave a lot of details on Howard, how the sex was ridiculous.  It was athletic.  Right.  You were, like, exhausted. 
[02:54:30]  And you know me.  Were you out of your league?  Like, I like laying there.  A little mellow, more relaxed.  Just laying around.  Yeah.  I like somebody to have to hold a mirror under me to see if I'm awake or alive.  Yeah.  We, yeah, we totally.  There's a lot of crossover.  I went to a couple of his events and ONA fans would see me there and yell to me.  Probably something about a cab.  Probably.  But anyway, what's the show about?  So it's inside, Amy.  Yeah, it's some stand-up and me talking to people on the street. 
[02:55:00]  Kind of like those real sex interviews.  And some scenes.  A bunch of scenes.  Nice.  Oh, Jimmy's in the pilot.  Nice.  Yeah.  Oh.  You guys didn't see the pilot?  No.  No.  I have to show it to you.  Are you happy with the pilot?  I love it.  I love the, it seems like it's going to be an awesome show.  Nice.  I hope so.  I hope so, too.  That's pretty goddamn exciting.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  I can't believe.  My favorite are the letters from Standards and Practices.  It's a funny scene.  Oh, really? 
[02:55:30]  It'll be like, okay, addressing this scene.  We cannot show Amy being penetrated from behind.  We cannot show, we cannot see the actual hand job.  Maybe you could insinuate the motion.  Just like the most clinical description of the shit we wrote.  Been there.  They take all the funny out of shit.  Standards and Practices are rough on any network.  They're terrible.  Because their whole job is to...  But they always go too far.  They know they can help you out a little bit. 
[02:56:00]  Because they're just making it up.  But they choose not to ever.  They just don't want to lose their job.  Yeah, they just don't want to lose their job.  We had lawyers at CBS Radio drove us completely insane with the nonsense they would give us on  our bits and our show in general.  Because it's not necessary.  It wasn't.  Especially on cable.  Because on cable, there's no FCC.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, in your case.  They make it up.  Right.  But still, I have to show you these emails.  They're hilarious.  You should bring them in and read them.  That would be funny.  Yeah.  I could pull it up on my phone.  Yeah, I would love to.  Oh, hell yeah. 
[02:56:30]  Talk amongst.  Yeah, I want to see that.  Tom Green's here as well.  Oh, yeah.  Tom Green.  No, no.  You stay there.  You stay right the fuck there.  Put Tom over there.  Yeah.  Put Tom where Danny is.  And then we got Tom.  We got Jim, Amy, and Tom.  We got to shove everybody in.  Tom, Jim, and Amy.  We ran late with Brandon Steiner.  How long did we talk to him for?  Way longer than we thought we would.  I think two.  How long did we talk to him for?  Two?  Long.  Oh.  Were you bored?  No. 
[02:57:00]  That wasn't your thing.  It's not my cup of tea.  I understand.  Jimmy loves collectibles and stuff.  And you're a sports guy.  And I'm a degenerate piece of shit filth.  So, yeah.  Okay.  I'm that too.  Oh, that's true.  But you two collect things.  I have these.  Valtrux pills.  Okay.  I'll read you some of these notes from Santa's police.  Yes.  Okay.  Amy.  The word dyke is too harsh.  Please change it to something more acceptable.  Like lesbian.  Like damn or. 
[02:57:30]  Like lesbian.  You can't say cunt.  You can't say fuck.  We know that.  We cannot see Amy actually jerking off the naked actor or any hand movement from behind.  Why?  This is not even hand movement.  No.  They can't show it from behind.  They can't show your elbow moving?  No.  But it's cable TV.  No.  This one.  A subtle blowjob gesture here may work.  If it's too overly graphic, we won't be able to show.  My suggestion is to shoot a couple and send what you want, but also shoot a safety.  For the blowjobs.  Safety.  Safety.  Never shoot to safety. 
[02:58:00]  For the blowjobs.  Plural.  What a great show this is going to be.  We can see the heads go down off camera.  But we cannot see anything.  Bobby, this is my favorite.  Also, not sure what a chuck on the tits is, but we should avoid this, please.  Avoid chuck on the tits.  Chuck on the tits.  What is that?  I think that was in season one of Happy Days.  Sounds like coming on the tits.  It will need to be, I eat pussies for breakfast, or we will have to bleep pussy. 
[02:58:30]  Or context.  I just wish they would let you guys do your fucking thing.  By the way, here's the example.  Because this has nothing to do with cable TV.  Louie, this is why Louie works.  A Network said, okay, here's a couple things you can't say.  You do what you do as a funny person, and give it to us, and we will stay the fuck out of it.  And what you get is the most Emmy nominations that a guy has ever gotten.  Louie, hilarious, right?  It's legendary, because Louie said, I'll do a show for you, but you're not going to be able to see it. 
[02:59:00]  I will hand it in to you.  And if that's acceptable with you, then we got a deal.  But that's what happens when networks leave you alone.  But, I mean, Comedy Central is a lot better than a regular network.  Comedy Central has been very cool, but standards and practices, and even they've been more lenient than my first experience with them.  Okay, good.  But, yeah, but those emails just made me laugh.  Do you feel like you're able to work around this stuff?  Uh, I don't know.  I mean, we'll have to, but some of the stuff, like, uh... 
[02:59:30]  Because some of the stuff in your head, you just know, oh, my God, this is what will be funny.  I just know it in my bones.  Yeah, and I think some of it won't work if taken out.  Like, that scene, or, like, the scene where the chuck on her tits, that, um, I think that was the scene.  I just, we wrote about, like, how when actresses go on late-night shows, they're so, like, precious.  And the dynamic of, like, them and the host is always, like, oh, like, it's like, I have a crush on you.  No, I have a crush on you.  It's just so awkward.  And, like, the girl's supposed to be, like, this unbelievably hot whatever. 
[03:00:00]  And the audience, if the girl's always, like, and I'm a nerd.  I was a nerd.  And, like, I love, I loved Star Wars.  And the guys in the crowd are just, like, who started away?  Just, like, jerking off.  And so it just ends with, like, the crowd just, like, throwing their, like, uh, spooge all over this actress.  That's funny.  That's hilarious.  So what's the problem?  Yeah, come on.  So we'll see what we're allowed to do with that.  And then, but then after, like, we see her get hit with all this cum, they're like, um, they're like, oh, it's yogurt. 
[03:00:30]  It's Dan and Yogurt Day.  And, like, it's, we try to make it, like, they just, there was yogurt under everyone's seat.  Like it was a promotion or something?  Yeah, Dan and Yogurt.  That's funny.  That's fucking funny, man.  Come on.  You find out it was yogurt.  And you can show the blowjob, by the way.  Can you use a shadow?  That's a good idea.  A bobbing head shadow.  Wait.  But what is going to be shown in that scene now?  What parts do they take out?  I think they don't want to see me get showered with a cum.  Even though.  Who doesn't want to see that? 
[03:01:00]  But even though the reveal.  I'm like, you haven't seen it, okay?  But even though the reveal is it's yogurt.  Well, we'll see.  We're fighting back on that one.  So we can fight back on some of these notes.  I think it's better if you think it's yogurt, and then at the end, it turns out it's cum.  Yeah.  That's the reveal that it's actually cum.  No, that's what you should write.  Here's what you do.  You write it as saying, everyone thinks you're eating yogurt, and then it turns out it's cum,  and they're like, no way!  And then, how about this?  They think it's cum, but it's yogurt.  All right, that we can do it.  Okay, that's fine.  Go over the top, just so you can give them something back.  That might actually work.  Yeah.  Isn't that sad? 
[03:01:30]  You gotta go over the top.  This way, it looks like they're winning on certain battles.  Yeah.  We'll see.  I'm gonna fight for that.  I'm gonna fight for that.  Where's Tom?  Where did he go?  Where is he?  I don't know.  Are they bringing him in?  I don't know.  What is fucking...  What's happening?  Travis, you had autographs?  Iraq, what happened?  Iraq?  I was told he was coming in.  That was the last I heard.  Ooh.  I see Rolando, and I see...  There, it's Tom Green.  Okay.  Tom Green's got one of those hipster hats on.  Jesus.  Oh, no. 
[03:02:00]  I don't mind Tom.  Do you like the hipster hat, Amy?  No.  I don't like anything like that.  No.  No, I don't like anything like that.  I don't like guys who dress well.  I don't trust it.  Right?  Yeah.  You guys are all safe.  Yeah, we dress like fucking slobs.  You don't think I'm a snazzy dresser?  Snazzy.  Snazzy.  Hi.  Hi.  Tom Green.  Tom Green.  Ooh, they get kisses.  What's up?  Hey, man.  Hey, guys.  Sir.  How are you?  How are you?  Great.  Tom?  I just did the Comedy Zone in Charlotte.  And Tom, you were at the... 
[03:02:30]  Right?  You were just in Charlotte?  Yeah.  I know, because I got a bunch of tweets saying, Amy was okay, but Tom Green was better.  Whoa.  That's how I knew.  I was like, thanks, guys.  Sure, sure.  Thank you.  That's very nice.  They were all from Tom Green Live on Twitter.  That's who it was from.  Yeah.  And Charlotte, that was fun.  That was a good club, right?  Oh, yeah.  That was really fun.  Yeah, absolutely.  I like that out there.  That was a good time.  North Carolina.  North Carolina.  How are you guys doing?  Good, man.  Oh, Jesus.  Are we all right?  Good.  Yeah, just been kind of...  Yeah, just kind of getting going here.  Yeah, yeah.  It's good to wake up in the morning with you guys. 
[03:03:00]  Nice.  Thanks for having me on.  This is cool.  Good to see everybody.  Jim, what's up, buddy?  How's the stand-up thing going?  It's going good.  Yeah.  Like, yeah.  I've been going all over the place.  Like, I'm just saying I was just in North Carolina there, so that was cool.  Are you doing as many dates as, like, a fucking road comic and stuff?  The way you're out, you're doing it.  You're not just like...  People say you're killing.  Oh, good.  I've only heard good stuff.  That's nice.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  You're not just like a little hobby thing, like, I'm going to try stand-up.  I haven't stopped since I was here last year.  That's fucking insane.  Oh, jeez.  Really?  Wow.  Yeah, I'm enjoying it.  It's fun. 
[03:03:30]  Is it killing you?  Well, you know, a little bit, but it's tiring getting up in the morning.  But you get out.  Getting on planes and stuff.  But you get out and see the town or the city.  You're one of those guys.  Yeah.  They're making a lot of videos.  Making a lot of videos.  Yeah.  I just got a new video camera, and I go, you know, make little documentaries everywhere  I go.  Just a little...  That's pretty goddamn cool, though.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, it's pretty fun.  Can we see him somewhere?  Yeah.  I was in Arkansas last week, and I did one with these crazy guys that came to my show. 
[03:04:00]  But, I mean, do you want to hear about this?  Or do you want to...  Doesn't matter.  Anything.  Anything like this is the 10 o'clock.  What were you guys talking about before I...  Coming on Amy Schumer.  Oh, yeah.  We're not trying to hear about the Arkansas guys.  That's sounding...  I know.  Well, the standards and practices allow us to come to be shown flung all over Amy.  I heard that.  I heard that when I was walking.  I thought that sounded maybe more interesting than what I was about to say.  Let's hear about the Arkansas guys.  You never know.  These guys came to my show in Arkansas, and they were kind of these cool guys, and they 
[03:04:30]  were kind of like rednecks, I guess they were, right?  Sure.  And they had some photos of their car.  They built a cannon on it, so I went over and I just made a video with their car with  the cannon on it.  It's on my website.  It's on my website.  Did it fire?  Did it fire?  It's like...  It's just...  There were just some cool guys, you know?  There's some cool guys in Arkansas.  Some cool save guys.  Did the cannon fire?  They put like a mortar, a little firecracker sort of thing they built in it.  Oh, okay.  These guys were kind of cool guys.  This story doesn't go anywhere.  No.  You see, it's a visual thing. 
[03:05:00]  It's a visual thing.  Yeah, it's fine, because...  But how about these elections, man?  Boy.  Ah, the other...  Yeah, how about...  How about those debates the other day?  Let me tell you.  All slid our wrists through.  Let me tell you.  I...  Oh, wow.  Here's a pretty cool story, though.  I was...  I think...  I don't know if this is a good story, but I'll do some name-dropping.  Last week, I was in Los Angeles, where I live, and my friend called me up, and he was  with Richard Belzer.  Whoa!  He said to say hi. 
[03:05:30]  And he said, you know, come on down, have a drink with Richard Belzer.  I'd never met Richard Belzer before.  So I went down, had a drink with Richard Belzer, and we were talking, and it was awesome.  And then I told him I was coming up to New York, and he said, well, hey, come stay at  my place.  What?  So I'm staying at Richard's place this week.  Do you have to feed his dog?  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  I'm having fun.  He's got a spare apartment that I'm staying at.  Hanging out with Richard.  Why would someone do that?  I don't know.  We just had a good talk.  It was fun.  Yeah, like, how great of a conversation that was. 
[03:06:00]  Is that being nice?  Is that being nice?  Two famous guys, because Belzer's famous and Tom's famous, so he knows Tom's not a fucking  animal.  Yeah, you guys never invited me to stay at your place.  No, fucking way.  You're right.  You're just Canadians.  You guys are smarter than that.  I don't let my family stay at my house.  You brought livestock into your last house.  Why wouldn't we?  But it's cool.  I read his book on the plane, and I've got this portable podcast I'm going to do.  You want to do my podcast?  Portable podcast.  Yeah, it's a portable podcast.  Can it be done anywhere?  Yeah.  I was thinking there's not enough podcasts out there. 
[03:06:30]  Let's get a couple more.  I just feel like...  I'm going to call it two comedians talking to each other on the internet.  Ooh.  You know, that's an original idea.  So what's it about?  I haven't heard that one.  What's Richard Belzer's book about?  Comics talking to each other.  Does he talk about his dog a lot?  No, he's got this great book about conspiracy theories.  It's called Dead Wrong, and it's about the JFK assassination.  Maybe you should get out of there, Tom.  Is he pro or anti-conspiracy?  Well, it's about JFK, Marilyn Monroe, and RFK, and he's, you know, making basically the 
[03:07:00]  case that this was a conspiracy.  Oh, it is a conspiracy.  Yeah, absolutely.  Oh, I'd love to chat with him about it.  I know, Richard.  I'm kind of anti-conspiracy.  I would love to chat with him.  Jimmy just thinks it fucking happened like it looks, like the simplest possible explanation.  I think Lee Harvey Oswald just shot him from up there through the trees, around the corner.  I wouldn't name it.  I don't think Belzer is the answer to that.  No, I do think he does, yeah.  The Belz.  I think the Belz has been on too many of those fucking TV shows where he really thinks he's  an investigator now. 
[03:07:30]  He's getting him.  Really.  See, every time I go to Dallas, which is, you know, once a year now or something, I'm  in Dallas, and every time I go there, I go down to that Dealey Plaza, you know, and  What's the Dealey with that plaza?  It looks impossible.  You can use that.  Get away.  Use that in your comedy show.  It looks impossible to me.  The shot looks impossible to me.  Yeah, I think it actually is impossible.  I think it's a conspiracy.  It was repeated, though.  It actually was done by a sniper with Oswald's gun, and his time was improved upon.  What president would agree to do that again?  It was the most...  No, they actually, they rode the body through again. 
[03:08:00]  And he reshot the head.  But no, they've done those...  Oh, Terrell, with that face.  Well, we've got to be accurate, so take him off.  Why are you doing that?  It's for a pilot we're shooting on, for discovering.  The part that really gets me about it, though, is when you watch the Zapruder film, right?  Yes.  The Zapruder film?  Zapruder.  And, like, his head, like, you know, not to be, you know, morbid, but, you know, we're  talking about JFK getting shot, right?  It goes, it flies clearly that way, and from the opposite direction of the grassy knoll. 
[03:08:30]  And when you go stand on the grassy knoll, it is just so obvious to me that there was  another shooter there, right?  But have you seen the still photo of Kennedy, and it's an infrared image or whatever, or  a reverse image, of Kennedy at the moment of the head impact, his head is going forward.  It's not going back.  It's, uh, it's...  Getting a whiplash back?  No, but you could see, you could see literally...  And he had the back brace, so it prevented him from something...  Well, that's why he couldn't slouch.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:09:00]  But his head is going forward, and you could see material coming out of his head going  forward towards the front of the limo.  Yeah, I'll show you this thing.  See, this is the thing about these conspiracy theories, is you never know, because you hear  the opposite argument.  Like, you know, apparently, the...  This is a morbid conversation for the morning.  It's very morbid.  Yeah, but, you know, I mean...  Me having a hard-on is even worse.  It's too soon.  Too soon.  Too soon.  It's too soon.  It's too soon.  What a week or two.  It's fascinating.  What do you think?  You think someone from the grassy knoll, Tom Green?  Absolutely, absolutely, I do. 
[03:09:30]  Absolutely, I do.  Yeah.  I don't...  That's one that I...  I'm not a conspiracy theorist, generally.  I don't believe them all.  I mean, I don't think 9-11 was an inside job or anything like that.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I love those.  You're not a truther?  No, I'm not a truther.  Oh, man.  But this one, the JFK one, that's too much evidence.  But there's not really any...  No one could ever come up with a definitive thing, so I always just say, that's got to be  the easiest explanation.  Yeah, a guy in the window. 
[03:10:00]  That's what everyone does.  That's why they got away with it.  He's calling you a sheep.  That's why they got away with it, right?  You know, I was a conspiracy guy for a long time.  Yeah.  I firmly believed it.  And I argued it.  Yeah.  I argued from the conspiracy point of view for years.  Yeah.  And I read a few things.  What turned you, though?  What one thing?  Certains...  Continuing to read about it and continuing to...  Because conspiracy theorists are always debunking everybody else.  But when you read their shit debunked and the facts they've gotten wrong, it's like, 
[03:10:30]  oh, they also have a vested interest.  A couple of things.  I read a book by a guy named David Lifton, who's all about the medical evidence, and  it's called Best Evidence.  What was the...  His middle name's heavy, you motherfucker.  I'm far ahead of you, cocksucker.  I forgot you could say cocksucker on the air here.  Oh, fuck yes.  Cocksucker.  That's funny.  So enjoy that.  Try it in church.  What happens is conspiracy theorists will take the teeniest piece of an inconsistency  in an investigation and blow it up into anything. 
[03:11:00]  Right.  Yeah.  Like there was 13 shots when RFK was killed and Sirhan Sirhan only had an eight-bullet revolver.  Yeah.  But little things like that.  No matter how ridiculous something is in their theory.  They hold on to it.  That's great.  And they refuse to, like, you know, there's these myths about the way Kennedy was sitting  in the limo.  The diagram in the movie JFK was wrong.  That's not how he was sitting.  If he was sitting the way it showed you in the movie, of course it would have been ridiculous. 
[03:11:30]  All of these things.  Oh, the Warren Commission, that was a shoddy investigation.  It's the most in-depth investigation ever done.  It was a nine-month criminal investigation.  And all of this fucking nonsense that was put out by conspiracy theorists, that there  are things that are hard to explain.  But you hear, like, oh, the House Select Committee on Assassinations said there was a conspiracy.  That was acoustic evidence.  They agreed with all the fucking medical evidence.  They agreed with the bullet entries and everything.  It's all this nonsense. 
[03:12:00]  So reading all of that and conflicting it with what I had read for all these years, I suddenly,  it just made more sense, Tom.  The Bells would have something to say about that, I'm sure.  Why don't you tell them tonight?  No, but I mean, I hear him.  He's hanging out at his place.  I believed him.  I plan on having a fairly in-depth conversation about it.  Is he there?  He'd be on the street.  You guys are roommates right now.  Yeah, yeah.  Do you guys talk in the morning?  Well, it's next door.  It's next door, yeah.  Oh, okay.  It's like adjoining rooms or something.  Does he knock on your door and go, are you up?  Yeah. 
[03:12:30]  You want to talk?  You want to talk?  I hope so.  That'll be cool.  You know someone's quoting the movie?  I'm excited to get to know him.  When they say Oswald was a terrible shot, you always know they're quoting JFK when they  say Oswald was a terrible shot.  He couldn't have made that shot.  He was a ball out of a shot.  The fact that he made the shot doesn't mean that it was impossible to make the shot.  What if he would have taken those shots, completely missed Kennedy, been arrested?  It just would have been some footnote of an assassination attempt.  The fact that he hit him might have been the luckiest thing ever.  He might not have been able to do it again, but just the fact that he was able to make 
[03:13:00]  a very difficult shot doesn't mean there's something to that.  Multiple times in under five seconds.  He was a sharpshooter.  But he was a sharpshooter.  With an outdated Italian rifle.  Oswald was a sharpshooter.  He was a sharpshooter.  He was not a bad shot.  He was a sharpshooter and then he was a marchman at worst.  That would be great.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Multiple times, right.  Yeah, right.  We're not going to solve this today.  You know, why don't we all get back together again tomorrow and take up where we left off? 
[03:13:30]  Imagine if we did solve it today.  You know, breaking news later on in the afternoon.  Solves the JFK conspiracy.  On this dopey show.  Wow, that would be incredible.  On this stupid radio show.  Sometimes I just don't really believe what I see in TV or trust the government enough to believe the Warren Commission or whatever.  It could just be a big sham, the Warren Commission.  I find a lot of people are very distrusting of the government and very easily able to grab onto these conspiracies these days. 
[03:14:00]  I am.  I believe anything anyone tells me.  If someone shows me some movie, I'm like, I just buy it.  I'm such a sheep.  I'm like, oh, okay, 9-11.  Okay, fine.  We never walked on the moon?  Great.  Okay.  Sure.  Everything.  I believe any movie I see.  Bigfoot.  Yeah.  It's like you watch these debates, right?  You watch these debates and they're both arguing with each other.  And then the next day, one channel says, oh, this guy was lying.  And then the other channel says, oh, no, the other guy was lying.  And this guy was right.  No, the other guy was right.  So what's the truth, right?  Nobody real. 
[03:14:30]  There is no real truth.  Somewhere in the middle.  But as long as you know that there's no truth, the people that just watch, you know, whatever network and just take that as all fact,  which of course they do because they think these are the people who know what they're talking about and aren't aware of the agenda behind those.  That's what's dangerous.  As long as you know to sort of pick and choose what you choose to believe is true and take as fact, then you're okay.  But I think so many people are just like, oh, well, it's on the news.  That's why I keep it so fucking simple. 
[03:15:00]  Vote for the white guy.  That's pretty much what I'm doing.  Very black and white for you.  I'm just going to vote for the guy that I think is more like me.  So you're going for Obama.  The white guy.  He is a nerd.  Yeah, well, it just seems to be like, you know, it's all about who looks the most comfortable while they're lying to you.  It's a reality show.  That's what it is.  Well, he was more confident last time.  Well, I liked his tie.  He looks presidential.  Because Mitt Romney is more comfortable when he's behind a podium. 
[03:15:30]  That's what they say.  So he won the first debate because there was a podium.  He seems more likable.  Who gives a shit?  In the second debate, they're walking around and sitting on stools.  And they say Obama's better at walking around and sitting on stools.  So he won the second debate.  Romney had a practice getting up and off a stool, remember?  Yeah.  Did you see that on the news?  Yeah, they had the tiebreaker where they sit at the table.  Because they said he's a Mormon.  He doesn't go to many bars.  So he really doesn't know how to use a stool.  So he was actually practicing for the debate.  That's amazing.  Just because you don't drink doesn't mean you don't sit.  Right.  So stupid. 
[03:16:00]  You usually sit more when you drink.  That's true.  Romney didn't walk around that stage.  I drive when I drink.  I've been loving drinking lately.  Oh.  Yeah.  Lagavulin?  Scotch?  Really?  Just fucking drinking scotch?  Drinking scotch.  Just doing it.  Living my life.  A nice girl like you.  I don't know.  I like drinking scotch, too.  I love drinking scotch.  I went to New Orleans and shit hit the fan.  Scotches?  Yeah.  What happened?  You know, I just got fucking retarded.  Do you get wasted every night?  Yeah. 
[03:16:30]  Do I?  Yeah.  No.  I don't.  I haven't dragged you in a while.  Every second night you take a night off, then the next night?  If I know, I'm not going to have to be on camera for a while.  But when you're on tour, you get wasted before the show?  I did not have one drink in Charlotte.  After the show?  No.  Not even after the show?  No.  Why?  A couple of Lagavulans?  No, I don't.  Really?  No.  Do you?  Do you drink on the road?  I do, yeah.  Yeah?  Too much.  Do you drink?  I don't drink before the show.  Yeah.  And I don't drink during the show, usually.  Right.  Sometimes they send me a shot on stage, and then you have to drink the shot. 
[03:17:00]  So now I've gotten in the habit of telling the bar to send me a fake shot.  Oh, I shouldn't say that.  Ah, yeah, yeah.  Now everybody knows.  But, yeah, because I don't like being drunk on stage.  But then after the show, I like to have a drink or two.  And I like scotch.  I like to drink scotch myself.  It's a real bad feeling, getting on stage, your first 90 seconds, you slur a word.  Oh, yeah, I can't stand that.  That's the worst feeling.  Oh, it is bad.  And being hungover at the airport's not fun, either.  Oh, fuck.  That is a bad place to be hungover.  I hate that shit. 
[03:17:30]  No comfortable seats.  Oh, yeah, you're just waiting.  One thing you don't want to do when you're hungover is wait for anything.  Like, just the thing of waiting.  Ugh.  It's annoying.  You know, I'm in my 40s now, and I don't recover very quickly.  So I'm making a point to drink less on the road.  But I still drink on the road.  You don't drink at all on the road, huh?  But you like some Lagavulin when you're not on the road.  Yeah.  I pick and choose when I drink.  And when I do, I really do it.  Are you performing in New York this week?  I'm performing, like, kind of 45 minutes from New York. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, yeah, cool.  You're at Caroline's.  Yeah, Caroline's.  Are you going to come down to Caroline's and have some Lagavulin with me?  I would love to.  I'll be up in Nyack.  Oh, okay.  Levity Live.  Oh, yeah, I played there last year.  That was when I was in.  Look at you guys.  We're running all over the place.  Everyone go to Levity Live and everyone go to Caroline's.  Unless, of course, you live in Philly.  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy at Helium, right?  I'm going to guess that the Late Show tonight is sold out by now.  So I'm going to guess the only show with availability would be the Sunday 7 p.m. show.  Is that Helium at Helium?  Yeah.  See, I know all the stuff now. 
[03:18:30]  You do know all this.  I'm doing a show at Helium in a couple of months, too.  Helium.  Helium.  I'm doing a one-nighter.  I'm doing a one-nighter at Helium in a few months.  You're doing a showcase?  He knows all the lingo now.  He didn't know any of this.  He didn't know all the lingo.  A couple years back when you first came on the show.  No, you were a babe in the comedy woods.  Yeah, I'm having a good time.  You're so fancy.  Yeah.  That's pretty goddamn cool, though, that you've been doing this now for a while.  I'm having fun.  And people seem to like...  Do you bomb, though, out there sometimes? 
[03:19:00]  No.  You don't bomb anymore.  I never do.  Don't even worry about it.  If you're thinking of coming to my show, don't worry about it.  You'll have some laughs.  It'll be fun.  I never bomb.  Who opens for you?  Do you bring somebody?  I just usually get someone local.  Yeah.  That's cool.  I just get someone local.  Just take a chance.  Yeah.  And they're all great.  Yeah.  Actually, I've met a lot of cool people around the country.  And sometimes I travel with a friend or something, but usually not. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah.  The local guy that you know probably never, ever leaves that club.  Yeah.  I find when I travel with people, then you've got to talk to them and stuff and hang out  with them.  I'd rather just be by yourself.  Yeah.  I'm doing that, too, really.  You can always just leave.  You know, go, okay, it's bye.  And you go back to your hotel.  I'm like, are you hungry?  I'm hungry.  Let's go together.  I, in Charlotte, the first night, this dude, it's such a gamble who they pair you with.  This guy went up. 
[03:20:00]  Right before he goes up, he comes back to the green room.  He meets the guy opening for me.  And he doesn't even look at me.  He just sort of puts his hand out to give me a kind of high five, like a brother.  Hey, he doesn't even look at me.  I go, no, no, I'm a girl.  Hi.  No.  And you can look at someone when you meet them.  I think he was just nervous and trying to play it too cool.  And then before he leaves the room.  Oh, you shot that right, Dad.  Oh, yeah.  I'm like, no.  You turned that into, now I feel like an asshole.  And then I'm like, and before he leaves the room, I'm like, and you have a sensor on your shirt. 
[03:20:30]  And he goes, oh, I was in a rush.  And I'm like, okay, great.  You mean like he stole something from the gap?  And the sensor was on a shirt for Urban Outfitters.  And the sensor was still on it.  And the sensor was on a shirt.  And he goes, I was in a rush.  I'm like, that's why you didn't pay for it?  What do you mean, how does Amy know?  She's told the stories.  How do you know you're not like a prop guy?  He's not a prop guy.  I thought maybe it's part of the act.  You'd be like, oh, look, I got this sensor on my shirt.  Anyone ever walk out with a sensor on the shirt?  Right?  I'm on my shirt.  Maybe he did that, but he did not do that. 
[03:21:00]  It was not a part of the act.  Wow.  It's a gamble.  Oh, it certainly is.  Sometimes, yeah, sometimes.  They explode ink when you break those.  It shoots ink all over it.  Oh, and then you'll see someone with ink all over their shirt.  You know what happens.  It's like when you rob a bank and then the money has an ink thing in it.  Right.  That's sort of like the dye packet.  When I shopped, I never stole anything with a sensor on it when I was shopping.  No, no.  When I was stealing stuff as a youth, they didn't have any of that shit. 
[03:21:30]  No, they didn't have any of that shit.  They had it when I was doing it, but not that.  You know what the deterrent was when I was a kid?  Fear.  Fear.  That was it.  Did you ever do any shoplifting growing up?  Oh, fuck yeah.  The obligatory candy shit like that, but never anything big.  And you were petrified that either your parents are going to find out or the store owner.  Even back then, they didn't call the cops.  They fucking whacked you.  They threw you out of the place.  You couldn't go back in.  And that was like the place that you went.  That was like your bar as a kid was the candy store.  The fear is the best part.  Fear.  The fear is the best part.  That's what it was. 
[03:22:00]  Not from a mom and pop shop.  Like, you know, like a huge department store.  It's a nice adrenaline rush.  Yeah.  Sort of a cheap adrenaline rush shoplifting.  Totally.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You definitely get a little.  What have you stolen, Tim?  Tom, sorry, sorry, sorry.  I don't do, I don't do, I don't do, I don't do it anymore, but no, no, I, uh, I, uh, no,  I was really, it was just one, one sort of week, I think in high school where some kid  I was hanging out with, it was a bad influence.  We would go up to Dairy Queen every day at the mall for lunch. 
[03:22:30]  And, uh, you know, for a, and then he'd say, you know, uh, he started, this guy was like  stealing stuff all the time.  And then he was sort of like, like kind of, you know, in, you know, peer pressuring me  into stealing something.  So I went into the department store and I stole like a, a Pope John Paul spoon and a Duran  Duran cassette because it was just like, it was in the back in a sort of a bin somewhere.  It was in the safe area.  It was a safe area.  So I just stole some stuff I didn't want. 
[03:23:00]  That must've been the time where the Pope was coming around.  I don't feel bad about, cause nobody would have ever bought that stuff.  It seems like you feel a little bad about it.  I do feel bad about it.  Yeah.  I do feel bad about it.  I never felt guilty about stealing anything.  Nope.  Never.  I've never stole again though, since then.  Really?  Really?  Yeah.  Never stolen anything since.  Yeah.  I used to, I stole out of like the thrill and then out of necessity after, uh, you know,  I got old enough where I didn't have money and like the drive shaft went on my truck  once. 
[03:23:30]  I had a Ford pickup truck and the drive shaft fell right out of it.  So I didn't have money to fix it.  So I went out that night with my friends and we found a truck that was exactly like mine  and I just went under with a wrench and took the drive shaft and, uh, all I could think  of, uh, and it wasn't a guilt thing.  It was him starting the truck up in the morning, putting it in gear, stepping on the gas and  just hearing, and going nowhere and wondering.  And it probably took him so long.  Cause the first thing you think is not my drive shaft must be missing.  You think like there's a problem with it.  So, but it made me laugh more than feel bad at all. 
[03:24:00]  I wasn't like, Oh, the poor guy.  I was like, God, I'd love to fucking see his face.  Yeah.  What an asshole.  Yeah.  Let me clarify my story of just, just real quickly.  Cause I'm feeling a little bit of guilt right now for telling the story and I'm realizing  actually it wasn't a Duran Duran cassette.  I just said that to make the story easier to understand quickly on the radio.  It was Arcadia.  Remember Arcadia?  Arcadia had, uh, had, uh, had, uh, the Duran Duran offshoot where, uh, John, uh, uh, Taylor  and, uh, Simon Laban or something went off and did a side, a side project. 
[03:24:30]  So I've, it was in a bargain bin and I figured no one was ever going to buy that cassette.  And then the spoon, it was, it was known, whatever it was.  It was a spoon that had Pope John Paul II on it.  Right.  So I just figured no one would buy it anyway.  So it didn't really feel like stealing cause no one was ever going to buy it anyway.  It was Arcadia.  It was not Duran Duran.  That's all I'm saying.  It was Arcadia.  Tom Green's got some guilt.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Arcadia had its time.  Just want to clarify it was Arcadia.  People love, they love religion and they love spoons. 
[03:25:00]  I don't, I don't know that you're right about nobody else wanting it.  Well, I feel bad.  Uh, maybe I should go back to that, uh, department store.  Except they turned it into an indoor go-kart track years later.  They turned the department store into an indoor go-kart track.  So you were onto something.  I'd probably put them out of business.  So when did you steal a go-kart?  Yeah.  Did you get a thief?  That would be the funniest thing to try and steal.  That would be really fun.  Oh man, can you even get him out of there?  That would be great.  Just down the street.  Maybe.  I love those things.  Who doesn't love a good go-kart track?  Oh yeah. 
[03:25:30]  Isn't that fun?  Tom, you ever going to fall in love again?  Uh, yo, yeah, sure, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah?  I'm kind of, uh, I'm going through a, sort of a tough breakup right now, to be honest.  Another breakup.  Oh, sorry.  Tom Green, my God.  What happened?  I don't know if it's, it's, well, yeah, I think it's actually, well, what happened was,  I just, you know, honestly, I just, I'm, I screw everything up basically is what happened.  I screw everything up.  I was with my girlfriend for two years.  I was, we had a girlfriend last time I was here.  And now I'm sort of recently in the sort of throes of a, uh, of a depressing, uh, breakup. 
[03:26:00]  And, uh, yeah, it's upsetting.  What happened?  What did you do?  Yeah, what happened?  Uh, well, I did, I, I must have just been, uh, did something wrong.  I don't know.  It's hard being on the road.  I'm on the road all the time.  And then I get stressed out and stuff.  And gorgeous waitresses in Charlotte.  No, it's not so much that really.  It's just more like I just get stressed out and then I start freaking out about everything.  And then just typical stuff.  Too much pressure and stress for her.  Yeah, and now I'm sort of in this position where I realized that it was probably, uh,  you know, it's not a good thing to, uh, be breaking up with my girlfriend. 
[03:26:30]  Oh, man.  Get back together.  Yeah, I know, I know.  Did you break up with her?  No, I wasn't really, I don't really think so, no.  Oh.  Well, I don't know.  It's hard to say.  Was it amicable?  I don't really want to say.  No, well, I don't know.  I don't know.  It just doesn't seem like it was a good thing to do, though, at this point.  I feel like it was a bad thing to do.  So I'm a little torn up about it, to be honest with you.  But I think you always go through that, like, right after.  You go through that, I don't think this was good.  And then it gets okay.  Yeah.  You know?  You don't have to talk about this stuff just because we brought it up.  No, I know, but I wanted to give you an honest answer, you know? 
[03:27:00]  But you don't have to talk about it.  Because you asked me if I'm ever going to fall in love again.  And then I realized, you know, I guess I sort of was in love.  Just said I don't want to talk about it.  It's bad right now, but you guys will get back together and it'll be fine.  I actually hope we do, to be honest with you.  Yeah.  I hope we do.  Good.  That's a shame.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'm not trying to bring the mood down or something.  No.  It's like honesty, you know?  I like honesty, too.  Yeah, I like that.  Everybody goes through total horseshit with their relationships.  And there's bad times and there's good times.  Right?  Horseshit.  I've got to use that word more, too. 
[03:27:30]  Horseshit.  Yeah, that sounds a good sounding word on the radio.  Like, right now, things are good with me, like dating this.  But I know it's all temporary.  So it's like, you have to just enjoy it when things are good.  Yeah.  Because, you know, yeah.  It's temporary with your boyfriend right now, is it?  I mean, we just always break up and get back together.  Oh, okay, you do.  Okay.  So then there's still hope for me and my girlfriend.  Oh, yeah.  We've broken up for like six months.  I've dated other people.  Really?  Talked about it on the radio.  Your whole life is sitcom-y.  What are you talking about?  Your whole life is very sitcom-y.  How is it sitcom-y?  I don't know. 
[03:28:00]  Like, just the way you, your whole real life is like a sitcom.  Like a sitcom?  The boyfriend that comes in and out of the picture, able to, like, date.  You've got these wacky sex stories.  You're making it sound like I'm dating some nice accountant.  It's like, I date, like, one of the other worst human beings walking around on the earth.  There's nothing sitcom-y.  We are monsters together.  Really?  Nice.  We are horrible monsters together.  So why do you guys keep getting back together?  Because we love it.  We just love the drama.  We're fucking awful people.  No, no, no.  There's no drama.  It's never a, it's never a, like, you know, there's never cheating or screaming or saying. 
[03:28:30]  We've never said anything we regret to each other, but it's been over three years.  Are you mean about other people?  No.  Wait, I mean, I mean in general.  Like, when you talk to each other about other people, do you just bash the shit out of people?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Just, if there was a hidden camera, they'd be like these awful people.  There's truly no better love than a love based in hate.  It is so deeply marinating in hate around the clock. 
[03:29:00]  You have so much to talk about.  Yeah.  It's a very passionate feeling, hatred.  So, if you hate somebody or a group of people or this or that, and you could share that with someone, it's fantastic.  It's love.  That love.  That's true love, Tom.  Hatred.  You don't have that, I guess.  No.  Well, oh, man.  I think the thing is, I'm starting to, like, I don't know, like, I'm thinking, I think I'm, well, I'm not going to say this on the radio.  I think I'm starting to, like, my biological clock is ticking.  Does that happen to men?  Yeah, I think it does.  I think because I'm, you know, I'm 41 years old. 
[03:29:30]  I don't have any kids.  Do you want to have kids?  Yeah, I want to have kids.  You know what happens?  You know, and it's like, you know, because I like the idea of, like, having some kids and, like, take them and teach them how to play hockey and stuff.  Yeah.  Do you play hockey?  Hockey?  Yeah.  Well, I used to play hockey.  No, you don't, you don't, I don't think, that's the thing about hockey.  You don't keep playing hockey because it's too dangerous as an adult.  Right.  From strapping skates on and going out and slamming people into boards and stuff.  I think as people get, like, you get older, you start to fear death.  And then people like us who are a little self-obsessed are like, well, I don't, how can I live forever? 
[03:30:00]  I can make something with my body.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Yeah, I won't be around, but it'll be someone that kind of looks like me walking around.  This guy will talk about me, at least.  Yeah.  Speak to my representative when I'm not here.  Well, the other side of that, when you do have kids, you realize how fast your fucking life is going, though.  Really?  That's the other side of that.  Right.  Fuck yeah.  Because they just grow up so fast.  And you realize, oh, wait, he's my fucking replacement, and he's getting bigger every day.  Oh, my gosh.  That's the other side of it.  You're growing a replacement.  Yeah. 
[03:30:30]  You're growing your own replacement in your own fucking house.  Here it is.  Oh.  Sometimes you grow your own fucking murderer, too.  Oh, yeah.  That is kind of weird.  I was thinking about that.  I've always found that weird, where you have a kid, and that's the person that takes you out of the world.  Yeah.  How weird is that?  He could actually kill you.  It's like a walking fucking disease that's coming to get you later in life, right?  How do you deal with the pressure of all the outrageous things the kid could do?  The kid could be a murderer.  It could murder someone else.  Of course.  It's crazy, right?  It could go rob a Pope John Paul spoon somewhere and get thrown an Arcadia tape. 
[03:31:00]  Stealing Arcadia tape.  And a not Duran Duran, an Arcadia tape.  Yeah.  You know?  You've got to be worried about those bad decisions.  Did you see We Need to Talk About Kevin?  Hmm?  Did you see that movie, We Need to Talk About Kevin?  No.  No.  Oh, God.  That's the worst thing that can happen.  It sounds very familiar.  Tell the Swinton's in it, and they just wind up having this kid that is a monster.  Really?  And it all leads up to a really awful thing.  See, that's what can happen.  That's nice.  That's one of the many things that can happen, Tom Green.  It just scares you. 
[03:31:30]  I was like, I put in two NuvaRings that month.  I was like, get up there.  Do your job.  Are you petrified of pregnancy?  I've never been pregnant.  I think something must be wrong with me, but I'm not petrified of pregnancy.  I could see myself one day wanting to do it, but it would be because of narcissistic reasons.  If you, God forbid, got pregnant now during this big time, would you have it killed in  a legal fashion?  At 31, I don't think I'd have it. 
[03:32:00]  Would you legally have it killed?  At 31, I would.  If the Supreme Court allows you.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  I fucking love Tom Green.  I just decided I'd love Tom Green.  I said it all.  Like, what the fuck?  Does that make you uncomfortable?  It's a little harsh.  I mean, I'll hump a dead moose, but that was a little harsh.  It was a little harsh.  It is.  I think I'd Juno it.  I'd carry it and give it to some sad Southern family.  No, I would keep a kid at this point, but I know I would have had I been pregnant when 
[03:32:30]  I was younger.  Imagine this, though.  You're pregnant.  You're pregnant.  You decide to keep it.  Yeah.  And then during the pregnancy and stuff, you lose out on all these inroads you're making  now as Damie Schumer and stuff.  And then you just have such resentment for the child that fucked up your career.  And my body.  And your body.  Oh, God.  And then you're just a disaster.  I'd rather.  I'd rather.  I'd rather, I'd rather, I'd rather kill it than put it up for adoption.  Geez.  Why?  Fuck yeah.  Cause I don't want. 
[03:33:00]  I hope he's from the, if I can't have you, no one will.  Yeah.  I don't want it.  I don't want to know that I have a kid out there that I can't be in contact with.  Really?  Well, I'm sure you do.  You think I have a kid out there?  Yeah.  Out there somewhere, right?  Yeah.  It must be a few of them.  Yeah.  What do you think?  Those cold nights in Western New York.  Yeah.  Right.  Come on.  The Liam's sold out now, Jimmy?  You made the.  I think it's probably.  I think tonight's clean.  We'll see Sunday.  Sunday.  Sunday.  What are those tennis balls?  We were supposed to sign them, I think.  Oh my God, no.  For my back.  For his back. 
[03:33:30]  You don't want to know it.  This is just.  Yeah, for his back.  It goes right in his hole.  Jimmy's always up to something.  This is such a Jimmy thing.  Literally.  My back has been tense, so I'm just kind of.  I put them on the back of my chair.  It's my fault for asking.  And I do this until I come.  That sounds great.  I have heard that's good.  I'll paint them black and I'll put them on my chin and I'll go, no.  But I'll suck them anyway.  You know how it is.  I use a badminton shuttle.  Oh, God.  A shuttle.  That's good.  That was a bad joking shuttle. 
[03:34:00]  Tom, they're saying you have another interview.  Oh, God.  Let's go.  E-Rock.  The E-Rock.  Back me up, E-Rock.  No, where are you going?  He has to go to Sway.  Can I hang out here for a bit?  Yeah, Sway.  I got to go to another one.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Hell yeah.  I think we're more your demo than Sway.  No, he's like.  Yo, that's the weird motherfucker.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm doing the serious tour.  Oh, you're doing the tour today?  You are, yeah.  You're all over this place.  I don't really want to go, though.  That's the thing.  I know, right?  I'm fun.  How much longer are you guys on for? 
[03:34:30]  Well, we were supposed to be out of here 10 minutes ago.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  The show's ending soon anyway?  We stay over time with you guys.  We stay late.  And we never stay late.  Nice.  Well, can I just keep talking until you end it?  And then we all leave together?  I'd rather just end it.  If you're ending soon, I'd rather just.  That's what I'd rather do, too.  That's fair.  And just sort of wander out of here.  I wonder if we're talking about you after you leave.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are they doing?  No.  Wonder?  Unless I have to go.  Do I have to go?  No.  No.  We don't care.  Do you really go for a little bit longer? 
[03:35:00]  Yeah, we are.  We fool around.  It's up to us.  Yeah.  You just keep going as long as you want to go.  Yeah.  And then when we run out of steam, we get the fuck out of here.  Okay.  Well, not necessarily.  We'd be out by 7.10.  True.  It's all stretching.  The first hour of the show is always amazing.  Wow.  Yeah.  Because we have all the energy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're ready to go.  This was fun.  I had fun here.  It's a lot of fun, right?  Yeah.  I'm not coming to you.  You've been shocked a few times in the last half hour or so?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Amy will do that.  It's terrible.  I get shocked all the time.  She's a horrible person.  People want to know if you still get periods, Amy. 
[03:35:30]  Sorry.  Oh, man.  I'm 31.  Yeah.  What the hell does that mean?  I still believe the Twix Flakes.  Because you're surprised.  Well, because the whole you haven't been pregnant thing.  Yeah.  I've never been pregnant.  Would you guys do my podcast?  No.  My podcast?  No.  No.  Portable podcast.  I'm going to do your podcast.  Of course.  Portable podcast.  Yeah.  I can show up at your house or something like that.  Or we could do it at a Starbucks.  Yeah.  Let's do it at a public.  That's great.  We could do it on a bus stop somewhere.  Is it battery powered?  Yeah.  I can make that happen.  That's like anywhere you could go then.  Yeah.  That's pretty fucking cool.  We could do it at a bus stop somewhere. 
[03:36:00]  Just go talk at a bus stop.  That sounds good.  I'd love to talk to you at a bus stop.  I can take phone calls and stuff too.  We can take calls.  Every couple of minutes he does the air.  Bah!  Bah!  Oh, my God.  I'm sure you guys have talked about this forever.  But that uppercut.  Holy shit.  Oh, on the bus.  Oh, that video.  Yes.  I can't get over it.  I've never loved the man so much.  Wow.  He's the funniest bus driver since Ralph Cramden.  She got right up.  How the fuck did she take that?  You haven't seen the video?  Tom.  Tom.  Tom. 
[03:36:30]  Uppercut.  It's a bus driver.  He's on a bus.  There's a black guy.  Bus driver.  Black chick.  She's like a ghetto rat.  Kind of skinny.  Black chick.  And she's bad mouthing the bus driver.  We get the race.  We get the race.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, you got it.  His hands are black.  Black, black, black, black.  Not the palms.  You know, those people.  Exactly.  And what they're capable of doing.  No, because you got a kind of...  It's a whole different vibe if it's white people on the bus.  Not a real person.  It's a whole different vibe than black people on the bus.  You're right.  So when the black chick is yelling at the black bus driver, blackly, in a black-like way, 
[03:37:00]  they're arguing.  And she pushes him at one point.  He's driving the bus.  She spits on him.  And spits on him, yeah.  And he pulls the bus over.  And she's just...  And he fucking pulls his arm way back.  Bam.  Hits her right under the chin.  She's like, go.  He's like, you want it?  You want it?  You want it?  Okay, here it comes.  And she flies backwards.  Wow.  And he points at her.  He goes, you want to act like a man?  I'm going to treat you like a man. 
[03:37:30]  Wow.  And he picks her up and throws her off the bus.  You're going to jail now.  Yeah.  And he picks her up and throws her off the bus.  She comes back.  She gets it back on.  Comes back at him.  I'd have been fucking gone.  He's the greatest guy ever.  It was the greatest.  Yeah.  We really like when a woman gets fucking knocked out.  Yeah, absolutely.  Pop when it hit him.  That's a little...  I mentioned a little applause for...  Yes.  No.  I love...  We love when a woman takes an uppercut.  It's just a thing of beauty.  It's from a man.  It's just amazing.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Punch.  He pulled that way back.  And she's awful enough that you're not upset.  Danny, you want to see it real fast and then we will leave? 
[03:38:00]  Yeah, okay.  Because we can't compete with this fucking punch.  I'll tell you right now.  Yeah, that's good.  Who's going to be at Caroline's all this weekend?  Yeah.  And the Amy Schumer at Levity Live.  Levity Live.  West Nyack, great club up there as well.  And I'll be at the Atlanta Punchline soon.  I think these people out there can figure it out.  One night Tom Green, one night Amy Schumer.  Yeah.  I'm going to Ohio.  Ohio.  I'm going to be in Baltimore.  A swing state.  Yeah, and I'm going out to...  Where in Baltimore?  Where am I playing in Baltimore?  The Comedy Flick Factory?  Yeah, I think so.  Oh, cool.  I think so.  Oh, here we go. 
[03:38:30]  Watch this punch.  I'll bring my granddaughter up in.  I'll bring my granddaughter up in.  Okay, well, bring them.  Nigga, bring your mammy up here, bitch.  And I'll be harassed.  Oh, shit.  Nigga, I'll go up that house.  She's got nice tits.  Looks like somebody sliced your face up.  Oh, you motherfuckers.  Your face up.  Oh.  See, she pushed him while he's driving the bus.  So he stops this bus.  Let's go, nigga.  Oh.  Oh. 
[03:39:00]  Oh.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  See, Tom, you should have done that on your show.  Man.  100% justified.  Jesus.  But she gets up, man.  She's a rough one.  She comes back at it.  And I can't stand when people shoot vertically with their iPhone.  Yes.  Everybody knows the aspect ratio of YouTube is 16 by 9 widescreen.  You've got to turn your phone sideways.  Again, if I can bring race into this again.  Oh, okay. 
[03:39:30]  I was saying the technical aspects of this.  I do notice black people, when they video stuff for World Star Hip Hop, usually do hold  the cameras up like this.  Yeah.  I have an attachment that will be fantastic for that.  Okay.  It's a plastic gun.  Oh, God.  And what you do is you attach the camera on top of the gun in portrait mode.  So when they point it, they normally turn the gun sideways.  Now the camera is the proper way.  It's the right way.  And you're holding your gun. 
[03:40:00]  They hold the gun sideways.  That is more the sort of gangster way of shooting.  Gangster way to shoot.  You've got to turn the gun sideways.  So the camera being on the gun turns sideways.  Maybe that's how Oswald didn't pull it off.  We've done a lot here today.  Maybe he was holding the rifle sideways.  That's how we pulled it off.  Put a little spin on it.  I think you solved it.  I always think Tom Green will never be back on our show.  I knew we solved it today.  Because he gets a little shocked by us, I think.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  I love it.  I love it.  Yeah.  Anytime, obviously. 
[03:40:30]  I'm always surprised that you invite me back.  Please.  Every time.  We love having you on here.  Why don't we get out here?  It's a lot of fun.  Because Tom really has to go to Sway next door.  Sway.  Across the tracks.  I'll let you guys shut the show down.  We do it fast.  Watch.  Watch.  Watch.  We have to plug.  And Jimmy?  Helium tonight.  Sunday.  Oh, my God, Jimmy.  I also have Friday, November the night.  I'll be in Toronto.  I haven't been in Canada in quite a while. 
[03:41:00]  Get up there.  My homeland.  Randolph Academy, Dark Comedy Festival.  And November 15, 16 and 17, I will be in the aforementioned Dallas.  God, it's making my skin crawl.  At the Addison Improv.  Yeah.  Nice.  Go down to Dealey Place.  I've already been there, and Oswald did it.  Buffalo, New York, New Year's Eve.  Why did you do that to yourself? 
[03:41:30]  December 28th through 31st at the Helium Comedy Club in Buffalo.  It's crazy.  There's a Helium in Buffalo?  It's open, yeah.  And it's crazy to go up there.  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry I did this, guys.  All right.  Breaking news.  Sway just canceled, Tom Green.  Oh, no.  In this weather, because it's cold enough.  I'll be in Atlanta November 9th and 10th.  And everybody add me on Twitter, by the way.  My Twitter is at TomGreenLive.  Not at TomGreen.  It's at TomGreenLive.  Are you sure?  Why?  Who happened?  I didn't want to bring it up this time. 
[03:42:00]  Are you sure?  It's TomGreenLive, right?  Yeah, TomGreenLive, yeah.  That's the better one to have, anyway.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sorry about that, Tom.  We think that we get cold.  Have we officially apologized for that?  No, no.  No need to apologize.  I want to apologize.  Buffalo, and man, it is always cold.  Amy Schumer, Levity Live, West Nyack, starting tonight.  Yeah.  I'm out.  Amy's got some very funny stuff.  I got jokes.  And get all my dates at TomGreen.com, on my tour calendar on TomGreen.com. 
[03:42:30]  And buy us some whiskey.  Thank you.  Lagavulin.  Get some scotch.  Oh, yeah.  It's got time to do that.  So when do you drink scotch, then, if you're not drinking it on a boat?  Well, I wait until I'm with people I really love, that I want to be around.  And then I drink it with them.  Where do you go drink in L.A.?  Do you go drink in L.A. ever?  I don't go out to drink.  Oh, you don't go?  I drink at my hotel.  Just drink at home.  Oh, yeah.  Stay home.  Get drunk by yourself at home.  Okay.  No judgments there.  No, none at all, Amy.  We can't all steal shit from the bargain bin, Tom.  Yeah, exactly. 
[03:43:00]  We all have our little issues.  The kilt.  All right.  I love you guys so much.  Say it back.  Say it back, everyone.  Jimmy, everyone say it.  I love you, Tom Green.  Thanks, of course.  But now that we've all said we love each other.  No, no.  Please.  Oh, God.  Please, John.  I've had it.  I've got to talk to you.  I'm out of this show.  All right.  Good night, everybody.  We are the dinosaurs marching, marching.  We are the dinosaurs. 
[03:43:30]  What do you think of that?  We are the dinosaurs marching, marching.  We are the dinosaurs.  We make the earth flat.  We make the earth flat.  Sirius XR.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Everyone's still here. 
[03:44:00]  Tom Green, Jim, Opie.  Okay.  Turn on that mic, Opie.  People want to hear these conversations.  Yeah, I mean, I'll have a few of my friends, but I'm doing the show without Aunt Jim because  they're out tomorrow.  Okay.  Come on by.  The way it should be, finally.  Yeah, good.  Whenever you can.  You can sleep in a little bit.  Get here around, you know, 8.30 or so.  Okay.  All nice.  We're playing at Lucy Goosey tomorrow.  Yeah, but we're going to just fool around.  It'll be one of those, like, loose shows.  Not as structured as today.  Right?  Yeah, because today.  Yeah, it was very structured today. 
[03:44:30]  Very structured.  We had all that horrific stuff penciled in today.  Yeah, okay.  Outlined by the 15-minute increment.  Yeah, we had it all on the time clock.  Yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  You know, abortion, heads exploding, and...  We've got to make sure we get abortion talk in on the quarter hours because otherwise  our listeners...  Yeah, and said relationships were penciled in.  Yeah.  Said breakups was penciled in for 9.35, so we hit that, too.  Yeah.  That's cool.  I was happy to talk about it, actually.  It kind of got a little...  And I'm going to try to see you at Caroline's this weekend.  What's that? 
[03:45:00]  I'm going to try to see you at Caroline's.  Okay, yeah, yeah.  See how you've improved since last time.  Yeah.  See the growth of...  Thanks, Tom.  See you later.  Tom Green at Caroline's all weekend.  Yeah.  Amy Schumer at Levity Live all weekend.  Yeah.  You got all weekend, so go to both shows, you know?  And I'll be on YouTube all weekend working on that viral video.  You see my CM Punk video is getting some steam, too?  Yeah, I saw that.  It's all right.  I mean, I got the wrestling audience.  You don't have the wrestling audience, Opie. 
[03:45:30]  I saw that.  My video is doing very well.  You know that.  I noticed you had a big exclusive Donald Trump video on Twitter yesterday.  What are you talking about?  You tweeted something about having an exclusive Donald Trump video.  I didn't say it was exclusive.  All I said was, if you missed the big Donald Trump interview, here's the link.  I just want to make it nice and easy for everybody.  Unfortunately, the link led to that stupid basketball trick shot, which is just...  Do you think more people have been infuriated at your basketball trick shot video or annoyed?  They're extremely annoyed, which makes me laugh all day long, because all I get is tweets like, 
[03:46:00]  Damn it, you got me again.  See, I fucking hate you.  Stop it already.  And I try to write those people back, but I can't get to all of them.  There's so many annoyed people you can't get to all of them.  That's what's good about the Twitter app on the iPhone, that it gives you a preview of what the video is before you click it.  So every time I just open the tweet before I click the link and go, Nope, not going to get me this time, opester. 
[03:46:30]  I got a new strategy.  You watch.  I'm all about thumbnails.  Oh, no.  I'm moving into the thumbnail category.  The thumbnail.  You know what that stupid video I should have done?  I'll be honest.  If one of my videos does 20,000 views, and I swear to you, that's what I'm looking for.  I'm happy with that.  That's my little niche, my little audience that enjoys my videos.  That video probably should have done about 15,000 to 17,000.  It's pushing 40,000 views now, and that's because I'm tricking people. 
[03:47:00]  If you remember, the day after you took the video, you came in here because it was right around the iPhone video thing.  And so everybody was talking about viral videos on the show, and you said you thought you had one,  and then you just searched in trick shots so you could see how it lines up with everybody else's.  Yeah, of course.  And you didn't realize there are literally thousands of basketball trick shots.  And some of these shots are so much more amazing than mine.  You know what?  I think there's one where a guy throws it out of an airplane, a moving airplane. 
[03:47:30]  And you're just like, look, it's the full court.  It's the whole thing.  I was kind of depressed.  I really thought I had it.  Guys are, like, bouncing, like, off the roof, off the, you know, pool deck, into the hoop, and you're like, full court.  And I've got to continue dealing with idiots who, they really believe that I'm still trying to work it legit.  Like, I'm trying to work the amazing basketball trick shot video legit.  Like, I really believe that it should be viral, and I'm pushing. 
[03:48:00]  And they think I'm pushing a little too hard.  I'm like, no, you idiot.  That's not, it's now become a goof.  If you thought that deserved to be a viral video, you probably wouldn't be misleading people into clicking it.  Over and over and over again.  I don't know how anybody can click any of your YouTube links at this point.  Yeah, have we talked about OP Radio on Twitter, or am I here for free?  What's going on?  Well, it's OP Radio on Twitter that leads to OP Radio on YouTube, which is just strong branding.  It's a lot like the Not Sam brand.  I just don't have OP Radio on Facebook, which pisses me off. 
[03:48:30]  I'm OP Radio fans on Facebook.  You know what, I hate Facebook, because not only are the fan pages shit, but, like, I have Facebook slash Not Sam.  But that was my Facebook page, and then it filled up with people, so I opened the fan page, and I can't take that name and just make...  Or just move it over.  Right, I can't direct people anymore to Facebook slash Not Sam.  I've got to send them to Primetime Sam Roberts.  I'll be extremely happy when Facebook goes away.  Just, yeah, I can't believe it's still around. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah, somebody's going to just come along and just completely kick its ass.  You don't need it anymore, at all.  Like, all the necessities are covered on Twitter.  And as soon as people start, like, making more business contacts through direct messaging instead of the little private messages on Facebook...  Right.  ...Facebook's done for.  I will be posting my video I did with Joe DeRose and Bill Burr on my Facebook page, OP Radio Fans.  Is that exclusive to Facebook?  No, I kind of, I kind of, like, retweeted some people that thought they liked the video, so I retweeted that and said thank you. 
[03:49:30]  Oh, you mean the...  But I'm going to put it, you know, nice, all nice on Facebook today.  The web series video that you did for Joe.  Yeah, it came out good, man.  I liked it.  Now, this is...  People seem to like it.  It's a big video for people to watch of you, OP, because they're used to OP as a performer on the radio, but when it comes to the viral video, you're a behind-the-scenes guy.  You're a director-producer.  Let's not forget some of my more famous acting roles, being a model in the Coke t-shirt. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah.  Don't forget the XFL shit I did.  How about Opie on top of a ladder, and you don't want me to sing.  Thank you.  You don't want me to sing.  These were all big hits for the OP-ster.  So you have a history of acting, on-camera performance.  A lot of acting.  Took a couple decades off, but I'm back.  Stronger than ever.  In this Joe DeRosa video, you're playing a security guard, and, I mean, you texted me yesterday.  You know that I drove Joe DeRosa crazy, because I said, look, first of all, I'm all in. 
[03:50:30]  I'm not going to sleep.  I'm going to eat, like, shit for a couple weeks.  Oh, so you wanted to look like a behind-the-scenes, like—  I want to look the part, because when he told me that he wants me as a security guard, I'm like, I can't—no, that's not me.  That's stupid.  I go, wait a minute, Joe.  If you put me up a little higher, I'll look like a security guard.  So you're thinking—  If I grow a shitty little fucking couple weeks beard, I'll look like a security guard.  If I don't sleep before the shoot, I'll look like a security guard.  Because as it stands, you're too handsome to be a security guard.  I think Joe's in tomorrow. 
[03:51:00]  I'll get into it with him, because I drove him nuts with text messages.  I'm like, look, I'm all in.  I'm in.  I'm not going to just fucking go there and just fucking go through the motions.  I'm going to be your security guard when it's time to film.  And he didn't realize he was making their will-be-blood with somebody right now.  He thought he was just doing a silly little viral video with Opie.  Yeah, and I'm like, oh, I'm in.  He didn't realize Daniel Day-Lewis, Christian Bale, Greg Hughes are the same.  Yeah, it was like, I felt like I was Christian Bale in The Machinist.  Yeah.  I was all in.  Right.  I didn't sleep the night before.  I didn't do my regular nap. 
[03:51:30]  No.  No makeup for the opester.  Not counting calories before, you said.  Nope.  So having a little, an extra slice of pizza.  Oh, yes, I did, sir.  Maybe two scoops of ice cream instead of just one.  I have since lost the weight I gained for the role.  I was going to say, you look fabulous.  Thank you.  I just snapped back into shape.  I had to get back into the gym and get a trainer going and get those 10 pounds off me.  Now, you shot for how many days?  It was a couple hours.  It was two hours.  It was a two-hour shoot.  And you were able to bounce back after that. 
[03:52:00]  It was a couple hours.  What are we waiting for?  Cheryl Crowe is the name of the video that you're in, Opie?  Yeah.  Is that the one?  Yeah, it's on the Warner Brothers, like, I don't know.  It's like a Warner Brothers, like, project or something.  I didn't realize, like, Warner, the Warner Sound people were going to actually see my fucking video.  Now, apparently, Warner Brothers hired Joe DeRosa to make this web series because all these big companies have no idea what the future of broadcasting is whatsoever.  So they feel like they got to get on board with the internet.  There's not a creative bone in any of them. 
[03:52:30]  So they're like, let's hire some comedians to do it.  Let's get the talented and skilled Joe DeRosa.  Yeah, Joe fucking knows what he's doing.  He really does.  He's a very good writer.  He kind of takes away from my performance because of his horrendous tits.  It's the first thing I noticed about this.  Well, you know what, I'm conscious of, you know, the opster at times has some man boob action happening here.  I don't know how to call it pectorals, but go on.  You know, I got to keep up with it constantly.  I'm very aware of it.  And every once in a while, I get caught with my fucking flabbing. 
[03:53:00]  Titties out.  My titties out.  But in general, I'm aware of them.  And Joe DeRosa, man, he don't give a fuck.  No, I was thinking next time Joe DeRosa shoots, maybe try X out.  Some other size.  Yeah, he looks like a 14-year-old girl just getting her tits for the first time.  No, he looks like a 14-year-old girl that, like, has got a lot more tit than any other 14-year-old girl.  Like, he looks like the 14-year-old girl who, when you're in class, you have a crush on her.  Right there.  No, go back now.  Because look at those titties, man. 
[03:53:30]  Look at the close-up.  This is what I'm talking about.  If you're going to be a security guard, you've got to look the part.  You've got the shitty fucking grubby beard that I grew for about two, two and a half weeks.  Oh, but let me ask you, how did you get those bags?  I got the bags under my eyes.  Is that makeup?  No, I chose not to sleep, Sam.  I told you that already.  Oh, wow.  I didn't sleep the night before, and I didn't take my nap.  And look at that fucking look I'm getting.  I didn't take my nap.  Do I look like a security guard right there?  Do I look like I could get some shit done?  You look like a cranky security guard or a cranky DJ who hasn't gotten his nap. 
[03:54:00]  Well, but I'm not a cranky person anymore.  I haven't bitched in 20, what days today?  It's the 25th.  I haven't bitched in 25 days.  Is that right?  That's going to be the new countdown on the opradio.com website.  Well, that was a cheap plug.  But you did.  But look, are you studying the face?  There it is.  I learned something about acting right there.  Do I not look like a security guard?  You look like an annoyed security guard.  Yes.  Well, that's what I was supposed to play.  Cranky, annoyed.  Like, listen, I'm just here to do a job. 
[03:54:30]  I'm really not impressed with Ms. Cheryl Crowe.  I'm just here to make sure that you riffraff stay away from this dressing room.  I don't care where you got your passes from.  I was all in, and then fucking Joe kind of blows my performance a little bit because everyone's focusing on his B-cups.  I had to watch the video three times before I even noticed.  With nipples popping out, by the way.  I didn't notice you were in the video.  He's got, like, puffy nipples you can see through his shirt.  I didn't notice you were in the video until my third watching.  The whole time, I was like, oh, Joe made a video about his titties.  Look, look at that.  Look at Joe.  Look, come on, Joe. 
[03:55:00]  Look at me.  I'm even in security guard position with the hands, kind of, like, casual, but those fucking hands are ready to do some damage if I have to.  I'll squeeze those titties right off.  Right.  Type of thing.  Right.  And the problem with Joe, too, is that he wore that medium shirt, and so his gut sticks out, too.  So the minute that you stop being distracted by the titties, you're like, what?  He's got a gut, too?  He's an in-shape guy.  He's not a fat dude.  Sam, explain the shirt I'm wearing.  You're wearing a shirt that looks, I mean.  A little larger than what I would normally wear. 
[03:55:30]  No, why?  Because that makes me look like I might be a little fucking bigger.  I have to tell you something.  Because security guards are a bit fucking big.  Obi, I hope you don't take offense to this.  You look a tad overweight in this video.  Like a lot of security guards, I know, to tell you the truth.  Yeah, but that is the extra weight I gained for the role, plus the extra large shirt.  I don't wear XLs.  Oh, I know.  The Opster still has Ls.  Well, the Opster has a V, not an L.  No, let's stop with that, because everyone really believes you guys when you say that.  I've never had a fucking V, all right? 
[03:56:00]  I've never even come close to having a V.  His abs look great, do they not?  Yeah, he's getting turned on right now.  But listen.  And look, the black security pants, the black shirt, the black shoes.  And then I even had that fucking black thing, that fucking walkie-talkie thing.  Now, wearing all black, was that a choice you made consciously?  Yes.  It was.  It was something that you wanted to do to get in the role.  And I noticed that you tucked in your T-shirt that you're wearing, but you pulled it out a bit so it would fold over the waistband, giving all of us at home the appearance of a bit more heft. 
[03:56:30]  Giving the illusion that this security guard is well-fed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I mean, I'll tell you something about security guards, generally speaking.  I'm not happy with this part of the fucking video, because now I look about the same height as Joe DeRosa.  I did ask for a box to stand on.  You did.  That's what they used to do in the WWE, throw the wrestler on a box.  But Joe DeRosa got lazy with the fucking production of the shoot.  He got lazy with the core workouts.  Because when I'm at the top of the two, three stairs, I do look menacing.  But then when I had to get down to their level, now I'm their height. 
[03:57:00]  I'm like, Joe, this isn't going to work.  Yeah.  And plus, you're like.  I wanted a whole box system where I'm walking around looking a lot taller, but I'm actually on boxes.  And you're like, Joe, couldn't you have worn some type of a vest?  Just something like that.  Because not only am I now.  Vest or a bra would have been.  The same size as you.  Right.  But everybody's distracted by them titties.  Yep.  Once again, the titties.  See me walking out dramatically?  Because I've fucking had it with these asses.  Oh, I just noticed that the first time.  You know what I saw?  What?  Joe DeRosa turning around and his titty hitting the camera lens. 
[03:57:30]  That's what I noticed.  See?  And I think the titty hit my fucking shoulder as I'm doing the dramatic walkout.  Oh.  And there's the cast.  Wait.  Let me see the cast.  What would you?  Why would you?  Hold on.  The cast, Joe DeRosa, Bill Burr, Greg Opie Hughes, third spot.  What?  Son of a bitch.  Obviously, that's an order of talent from least to best.  Hello.  I thought I stole that fucking video.  I guess Joe didn't think so.  You know why you didn't steal it?  Why?  Joe's tits?  That's right, Opie.  That's right.  We established that.  Joe.  Joe! 
[03:58:00]  He tried to steal the scene by wearing a nice tight shirt.  Trying to get a little PG-13 action going on.  I'm hoping some movers and shakers in Hollywood see this little fucking role the Opster did.  The only moving and shaking that anybody sees in this video are those jiggling tits.  I think you're right, Sam.  You know, that's the problem.  I think you're right.  Because I had been waiting for the phone to ring going, you know what?  This is going to lead to the next one.  Warner.  And that phone has been wrong.  Warner's movie division has not called you.  No.  Because your acting performance is spot on.  I think it's good.  Like, I thought they just grabbed a security guard and then I was like, oh wait, that's 
[03:58:30]  Opie.  I know him.  That's right.  Huh?  The first comment is, anyone else surprised that Opie is actually a decent actor?  Now, first of all, why can't you just write something like, hey, Opie did a great job.  You have to put a little dig in there before you compliment.  Well, that's what they're about.  Yeah, little assholes.  They're very surprised that I could act.  Well, of course you can act.  You're a performer.  See?  You model, you sold more Coca-Cola in the 1980s than Ray Charles did.  Well, being a child of the 80s.  Did you do Coke or Pepsi?  I don't remember.  Being a child of the 80s, yes. 
[03:59:00]  I did sell a lot of Coke t-shirts.  Yes.  People were like, I got to have a beverage.  That's right.  Look at that handsome kid in that t-shirt.  Well, we don't have to do the whole demo reel.  That's okay.  Well, just YouTube Opie's demo reel.  Well, that's okay.  While you're on YouTube, Opie Radio, Opie's demo reel.  You've never seen this, Sal?  Fuck you, Sal.  I've seen it.  I just love it, though.  Fuck you.  See?  Yeah.  Well, you know what, Sal?  I worked in my craft.  Yeah.  Opie actually had some get-up-and-go in it.  That's right.  The cummerbund, man.  That's awesome.  No, that's how fucking tuxedos were worn back then. 
[03:59:30]  That's right.  A little cummerbund to match your colorful bow tie.  That's right.  Sal over here is laughing at you because he would never dream of doing this because he's  got no work ethic.  Look at the Enjoy Coke t-shirts.  I want a Coca-Cola.  Sal, could you grab me a beverage?  If I didn't know better, I would say that guy's gay.  Well, you know what?  Holy fuck.  The tight stonewashed jeans don't help anybody.  Well, that was what we used to wear there.  And you couldn't look less interested in that girl with you.  You're more interested in making sure the Oopster- 
[04:00:00]  Whoa, let's slow down.  That girl was not up to the standard of me.  No.  I look at that and I see the Oopster.  I look like a fucking model.  She don't look like no fucking model.  You know who the Oopster's in love with?  I think.  The Oopster's in love with the camera in that video.  He's in love with himself.  I don't even know this girl at all.  But look at how low her boobs are for a 19, 20-year-old girl.  Yeah, it's not good.  They're a little low.  Were you very fond of yourself at that age?  Did you think you were a very handsome guy?  Somebody who was going to get over in this modeling world? 
[04:00:30]  I put up numbers, Sam.  You did?  Yes.  Did you wake up in the morning and be like, ah, I'm struggling, trying to get this radio  thing going, and then look in the mirror and be like, shut up, Roland.  At least I got this.  Fuck.  Can I tell you something about the demo reel?  I don't know if we talked about it on the regular show.  Talk to me about it.  I started getting a lot of TV work and I had to make a decision whether I was going to  do TV or radio.  And TV bored me to tears, to be honest with you. 
[04:01:00]  Because you couldn't be creative or whatever.  Yeah.  But they wanted me to do this thing where I was introducing a new airline at the Rochester  Airport.  And that's the clip in this demo.  And I got that gig because, believe it or not, because of this MDA gig I did that's  on the demo reel.  The famous ladder shot.  So I show up at the airport in a suit looking the part like I'm supposed to be kind of like  a reporter.  And what I didn't tell the people at the time was I was completely fucking blind without  my glasses on.  You couldn't see.  I couldn't see. 
[04:01:30]  And they had cue cards.  Oh no.  I completely.  The part that's on the demo reel was the only usable footage from that day.  I stammered and stumbled and squinted my way through the entire fucking thing.  And they never asked me to do another fucking.  You blew it.  I blew it.  I was just going to ask you because you said I was picking between.  Because I was so fucking vain.  I didn't want to be on TV with my fucking glasses.  Oh my God.  So I chose that I'd rather not be seen with my glasses on so I couldn't see the cue cards. 
[04:02:00]  Because you were just sitting there like.  I fucked up my whole TV career.  You walked into the airport thinking I got to be the best looking motherfucker that most  of these guys have seen in their lives.  Right.  And then they were like read these cue cards.  And you're like that I can't do.  I couldn't do.  That I cannot do.  And I'm like wear your glasses.  And I'm like no fucking way.  You should not like Fallon.  He got a LASIK before.  Well this was the 80s.  Yeah.  It was the early 70s.  They didn't have LASIK yet.  Shut up.  It was the 80s.  Was it?  Yes it was.  That wasn't a good day for the old shirt.  It was officially the 80s.  So you blew your TV career because you wanted to make sure that chiseled jawline and those 
[04:02:30]  baby blues were not distracted by any glasses.  Well I was extremely poor too and so my glasses were shitty.  I had shitty glasses.  And you were like look.  So I took off my shitty glasses saying no I'll look the part without the glasses on but I can't  read the fucking cue cards.  But you knew it.  You were like poor kids that look this good.  Don't survive in the slums.  I'm on my way up.  Sam you tell them.  Up that handsome mountain.  I gotta go.  What are we promoting?  Well there's OP Radio on YouTube. 
[04:03:00]  There's OP Radio on Twitter.  At the same time there's NotSam on YouTube and NotSam on Twitter.  There's OPRadio.com.  At the same time there's NotSam.com.  So there's a cornucopia of various internet ventures that we're promoting.  And the Joe DeRosa video series.  I saw Jimmy's last night and I really really liked his.  You know there's cameos in the Anthony version.  In the Anthony video.  There's cameos from E-Rock, Sam Roberts.  And if you look closely you'll even find a Danny Ross in there. 
[04:03:30]  But E-Rock gets a big fat face close up.  Right.  I should have just said face close up.  I'm sorry about that E-Rock.  He's waving me off.  Have you been disappointed in E-Rock's lack of attention to the show as of late?  No, I think it's hilarious.  You like it?  Nothing bothers me anymore.  You know that E-Rock has tapped out of this whole OP and Anthony thing.  Huh?  You know E-Rock has tapped out of this whole OP and Anthony thing.  That's fine.  So am I.  A little bit, right?  The fact that I just tried to have a conversation with E-Rock about E-Rock not paying attention. 
[04:04:00]  And E-Rock responds by putting down his phone and looking at me and going, huh?  Well, that means that maybe you're in the same boat.  I was doing what everyone else does.  I was checking my Twitter.  No, he does that.  I'm trying to broadcast here.  Am I the only one left with passion?  I was checking my Twitter to see how wonderful the people think I am.  Me and Cousin Brucie are the only ones left that care, OB.  What?  Me and Cousin Brucie, the only ones left that have any respect for this art of broadcasting.  See, here's one.  Bro, you're hilarious when you talk openly and casually.  See, I took this whole thing way too seriously for way too fucking long. 
[04:04:30]  I blew the best years of my career being so intense and worried about everything.  You think I got to be more casual?  Yes.  Is that the lesson you'd pass off on to me?  Yeah.  Just fucking chill out.  I'm in the I don't give a fuck stage of my career.  Yeah, but you know where that attitude comes from?  Having the I don't give a fuck money.  When you're trying to make some money, you're like, I got to do this.  I got to do this.  I got to.  I got to.  Yeah.  I've had the F you money for about five years now. 
[04:05:00]  And you still gave so much of a fuck.  And I was too fucking tight.  My ass was just too fucking tight.  Yeah.  I noticed.  I had to complain and bitch.  I blew it.  I blew it.  So if there's one thing that you're passing down to me, you're loosening up my asshole.  Metaphorically.  Well, you said that.  Metaphorically, obviously.  Don't don't take that into the gutter.  It's metaphorically.  I don't even know what metaphorically means.  I almost got Sal's mom to tell me that she would give me ass sex on yesterday's after show. 
[04:05:30]  Has your mom ever had ass sex?  I don't know.  But has your mom.  Oh, thank you, Eric.  His mom's down for whatever.  Has your mom ever masturbated to Barry Manilow?  She said it on air yesterday.  Yes, she has.  I don't know.  Have you ever had ass sex?  No.  You haven't?  You've never taken it in the ass?  Never taken it or given it.  Oh, I was thinking taken.  See, I was with you on that one, Sal.  You were.  Me and you on the same page, Opie.  You know, women are on the same page as us.  Are we doing radio tomorrow?  Oh, yeah.  Ant's out. 
[04:06:00]  Jimmy's out.  We invited Tom Green.  I don't really know if I could do the radio without those guys, though.  You don't think so?  Opie, let me pull you through it.  DeRose is in.  Let me pull you through it.  Let me do it.  Give me the reins.  I can do it.  You think I could do radio without those guys?  I think this is going to be like Rudy.  You're going to get out there.  Yeah.  And you're finally.  That kid who could never cut it on the air can finally get his chance to shine.  All I ask, if I pull this off tomorrow.  You fucking heist me up on your shoulders with the rest of the gang. 
[04:06:30]  And you fucking walk me out of this place.  You know it'll go down.  You walk me out of this place tomorrow.  And I want fucking people in that hallway.  Yeah.  Fucking cheering me on.  Opie.  As I'm being carried out of this fucking place.  Opie.  If you ask any woman what the best gift they ever got was, without hesitation, without  even thinking about it, she'll say it was her engagement ring.  The one thing I did right, besides marry my wife, that's Steven Sears.  What happened?  I'm just talking to you.  But I had a good flow going.  I know.  I'm talking to you about something else.  You're creating a bit in front of your eyes.  There was radio magic happening. 
[04:07:00]  I got my wife a great engagement ring.  It was a whole concept.  Rudy, me, fucking doing radio without the big hitters.  Let me talk to you about engagement ring.  Can I fucking pull it off?  And if I do, you carry me out of this joint.  It's so important, the engagement ring I'm talking about.  It's not just a ring.  You know, Steven Sears has to fix two of my rings.  It's not just a sign of affection.  Is that right?  Yeah, we had to cut them off.  Oh, because you cut it off the finger.  My wife loves me so much, and the rings I got her from IHateStevenSinger.com, that she  refused to take them off.  All pregnant women have to take their rings off eventually.  She went too fucking long. 
[04:07:30]  Her finger was starting to turn blue and purple, because then she tried to take it off, and that  made the swelling even worse.  I almost had to go to the fire fucking house in my area, but then I chose to snip them  off myself.  Well, that's what happened.  I mean, the rings are everything to these women.  So I have to go back there to get new, what's the ring part called?  Ring.  Setting.  A new setting for the stone.  Is it a band?  Yeah, you could say a band, but it's a setting.  My wedding band, her wedding band, is completely destroyed.  Then you're not getting credit anymore, because usually you get credit.  Because that you can't patch up. 
[04:08:00]  Every time she shows the ring off, you get credit.  Now she's not showing it off.  So Opie, what I would say.  Showing it off, it's in a junk.  She can't do it.  You know how much I spent for my ring, and it's in a junk drawer right now?  It must have been a good deal, because Steven Singer offers.  Oh, I didn't get my ring from Steven Singer.  Stop saying that.  Steven Singer.  I forgot, but he's now my guy.  Offers a 100% money back guarantee.  My jewelry guy sucks.  This is radio.  What are you doing?  Throw the stupid script away.  It's a commercial.  Have you learned anything from me?  Throw the fucking script away.  You don't need it.  You speak openly and honestly, like that guy said. 
[04:08:30]  That's right.  I'm hilarious when I do this.  I don't give a shit, StevenSinger.com.  Opie's taught me to loosen up my asshole.  That's the wrong website, by the way.  Let me tell you this, Sam.  IHateStevenSinger.com is the website you should go to if you want.  Do you want to know what happened to my old jeweler, or what?  Yes, I do.  He went crazy.  He went nuts?  You know why he went crazy?  He went nuts, and now he's like doing some online thing.  You know why he went nuts?  You know where he can make fast money?  He's that guy now.  He went crazy. 
[04:09:00]  Why did he go crazy?  Because he couldn't compete with I Hate Steven Singer.  I mean, it just doesn't happen.  Nope.  I love both guys equally.  No, you don't.  Because my old jeweler might not be crazy someday.  IHateStevenSinger.com.  And he might have a huge fucking comeback, and you know what?  The Opie's going to be there for him.  Because that's what the Oopster does.  866, I hate Steven Singer.  Opie would fucking kick him when he's down, but the Oopster is sitting here waiting for  my jeweler to get out of the fucking nut house and get back selling fucking diamonds.  888, I hate Steven Singer is what I meant. 
[04:09:30]  But in the meantime, I'm all about fucking Steven Singer.  It's on the other corner of 8th and Walnut in Philadelphia.  888, I hate Steven Singer.  Or IHateStevenSinger.com.  You want to hear about my jeweler going crazy?  We got to go.  For real, he went nuts.  It's Ron and Fez's time.  But I'm going to fucking be there when he comes out of that nut house.  No, you're not.  Why?  Buy your rings at IHateStevenSinger.  And then I'm going to fucking kick Steven Singer back to the curb.  Listen to this.  That's the sound of my Steven Singer wedding band.  It's indestructible.  I took all my rings off until my fucking jeweler comes back from the nut house. 
[04:10:00]  You know what would happen?  Out of respect for him, I'm not wearing any of the shit I bought from him.  If you had bought your engagement ring from Steven Singer and your wife's finger had swelled up  and you had tried to cut that ring off, you would have had to cut her fucking finger off  because those rings are indestructible from Steven Singer.  IHateStevenSinger.com.  888, I hate Steven Singer.  I love him for now.  Other corner of 8th and Walnut.  Don't get me wrong.  I love him for now.  But when my jeweler fucking makes that huge comeback and he's back selling diamonds,  so long Steven Singer.  Say these words. 
[04:10:30]  Say the words.  Why?  Just say the words.  Troy needs them for production.  Just say those words.  Are these more of my crutches than people are pointing out?  No, I don't think so.  Say the words.  Any of.  Mm-hmm.  Thoughts.  Mm-hmm.  Racing.  We got it, Troy, and we will see you tomorrow.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  What did I just do to myself?  I have no idea.  What did I just do to myself?  I don't have a clue.  Troy needed it.  For what?  I don't know.  I don't ask Troy any questions.  What?  Well, he's not here.  Am I going to the Jets game Sunday? 
[04:11:00]  Yeah.  With the Philly guys?  Yeah.  You're going to get Ron Bennington upset.  But Ron loves us.  You're cutting into his time.  You think Ronnie cares?  Maybe not.  He's very happy that he does less radio by himself.  What do you mean by himself?  He'll be here, too.  Well, you know what I mean.  It's just understood at this point.  Ronnie does the show.  Good Jets.  Oh.  Jets Sunday?  Yeah.  Jets, Jets.  Good Jets.  I got good seats?  Yep.  Dolphins?  Jets?  Jets.  Look, let's find out what Ron and Fez think of this. 
[04:11:30]  Do we promote everything I need to promote?  Yeah, notsam.com, notsam on Twitter, notsam on YouTube.  I did this radio for free.  I don't even get a plug in the end.  Guests get plugs.  Not Sam.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Also, Troy's bit will be fine.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time. </pre>
