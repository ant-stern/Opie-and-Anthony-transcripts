<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts complaining about newly installed black decals obscuring their studio windows, hindering their view of incoming guests.  E-Rock was enlisted to remove the offending decals, which smelled strongly of industrial chemicals.  Opie then recounted his relaxing Turks and Caicos vacation, despite initial concerns about traveling with his young child.  He detailed an incident where his child defecated in a Mercedes SUV, resulting in generous compensation to the owner.  Further vacation stories included the island's rum culture, changing Club Med demographics, the local economy, and a fireman's strike causing flight disruptions.  He also shared humorous anecdotes, such as a cab driver's celebrity gossip (including Cindy Crawford) and a large woman creating a "bikini pool tsunami." Opie discussed the difficulty of resuming his reading after having a child, mentioning Keith Richards' autobiography. The segment concluded with a discussion of deep-sea diving, the bends, and the fear of submarine implosions near the Titanic.

The show continued with a rambling discussion on scuba diving, the ocean's depths (including the Titanic), and the immense pressure at such depths.  This led to a philosophical tangent on water and other elements, and a bizarre anecdote about "Frank Umbrella," the supposed inventor of umbrellas.  The conversation abruptly shifted to a Club Med activity director, "Handel," known for his numerous sexual conquests.  A caller, Lydia, shared a graphic account of being essentially "pimped out" to Handel by her mother at 16, resulting in her contracting syphilis.  Lydia detailed the encounter, including Handel's homosexuality. The hosts and Lydia engaged in a graphic discussion of the details.

The show then covered several disparate topics: Andy Pettitte's return to baseball; a comical audio bit about "Angerman" throwing orphans; a phone call from "Bobo Man" wanting to return to the show; the removal of a company logo from the studio windows; and reminiscences about the final episode of the Mary Tyler Moore Show.

A segment focused on a bad movie scene with Ted Knight, transitioning to a remembrance of Randy Rhoades' death 30 years prior (March 19th, 1982), detailing the plane crash and Ozzy Osbourne's presence.  They discussed Rhoades' career with Quiet Riot and a recent Bruce Springsteen concert they attended (third row seats), including an unsuccessful attempt to get a picture with Springsteen and sightings of Rosie O'Donnell and Michael Douglas.  A significant portion covered the implosion of Rosie O'Donnell's talk show, its poor ratings, and O'Donnell's difficult behavior and strained relationships with staff.  A protracted argument ensued about a planned live broadcast in Cleveland, with Anthony objecting to the cost-sharing arrangement for hotel rooms and security, comparing it unfavorably to Howard Stern's compensation. Kenny (a staff member) provided updates and seemingly contradictory information, creating comedic moments.  "The Busy Buddy Show" with Sam and Troy was also mentioned, along with several humorous promo ideas.  Anthony refused to participate in the Cleveland broadcast unless all expenses were covered.

The broadcast continued with a "Mr. Be Kind" incident involving Kenny, complaints about SiriusXM billing, and disagreements over payment for Jimmy's participation in the Cleveland appearance.  A discussion followed about an oversized cardboard cutout of Opie, leading to humorous suggestions for fixing the forced perspective.  The hosts discussed an addictive mobile drawing game, Opie's driving frustrations in Flushing, Queens (using offensive language), and general driving etiquette.  They compared WonderCon and Comic-Con experiences regarding celebrity access, and debated the media's reaction to Louie C.K.'s past tweets and Al Sharpton's past comments.  They criticized Virgil, a former WWF wrestler, for allegedly unscrupulous business practices at conventions, including overcharging for photos and autographs.

The final segment covered the legal limits of parody (specifically portraying someone as a pedophile), Donald Trump Jr.'s big game hunting, and a sexually suggestive photo (possibly photoshopped) with accompanying explicit commentary.  Kenny mentioned his Facebook likes.  Sam Roberts, hosting "The Busy Buddy Show" (with Troy Kwan), discussed conflicts with Opie, Anthony, and Jim regarding studio time and the new studio logo (leading to Opie removing the stickers).  The launch of a "Lonely Virgil" Tumblr page was announced.  The hosts debated the Cleveland show again, revealing disagreements and discussing potential pranks involving Eric.  Finally, they discussed their NCAA tournament brackets.  Throughout the entire broadcast, crude and offensive language, sexual innuendo, and sexually explicit topics were frequent.  A Ron and Fez intern was mentioned, alongside the regular on-air personalities.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:00:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:01:00]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:01:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now.  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:02:00]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:02:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:03:00]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:03:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony channel.  XM 105, series 206.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen, so appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What the planet are we living on?  It's the Opie and Anthony show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up. 
[00:04:00]  And Anthony...  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R-opening.  I don't even like an R-opening.  I don't even like an R-opening.  It sounds like a little...  What?  You just dang open-handed.  Don't listen to the dang open-handed.  Stop it.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, God damn it.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Well, good morning, everybody. 
[00:04:30]  Good morning.  Sunday morning.  Yeah.  I didn't see that guy today.  What?  I was hoping to see him.  My day isn't complete unless I see that guy.  Good morning.  Get off that elevator.  It's not a good morning unless he says, good morning.  So, whose idea was it for the decals?  I need to know right away.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I need to know right away.  Did you guys talk about this last week?  Yeah, we definitely talked about how it just blocks out.  Oh, my God.  They can't even put...  Seeing anyone that's coming down the hallway.  So, me bitching is cool, right? 
[00:05:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because you guys bitched about it.  Oh, yeah.  Because people expect me to bitch, but...  Whose fucking idea was this?  They can't even do decals right.  I think it's somebody that probably didn't want us knowing they were coming down the hall at  the end of the show.  So, we couldn't just leave without meeting with them.  You have to duck down to see people.  And we set up this studio in such a way because we wanted to make sure we could see all angles  and see who's coming and going.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Seriously?  And now... 
[00:05:30]  For the people that weren't listening or were listening, weren't paying attention,  whatever, it's a black decal that goes across all our window space.  Yeah, and it's right in your line of sight.  Eye level.  You know how a lot of times when a guest is coming down the hallway, right when you first  see him, you kind of get adjusted and like, okay, the guest is coming.  You start maybe doing a little, you know, a little pre-guest thing until he comes in the  door.  That totally blows it out because like last week, the guest was standing out here before 
[00:06:00]  I even knew he had come down the hall already.  You can't see it.  I think I...  I'm sure Gary didn't miss me when I was away.  No.  I would bet you a lot of money on that one.  I bet not.  I don't think so.  You know, some people, I wonder if they miss me, but I know Gary certainly did not miss  me.  I don't think.  Because I remember saying that, hey, you know, when we shoot our videos and take our pictures,  we want the Opie and Anthony logo in the video and the pictures.  So let's turn the logos around.  Yeah.  And it was like see-through logos, basically.  You could see right through the Opie and Anthony to see the, like you just said, the guests 
[00:06:30]  coming down the hall and whatnot.  Yeah.  It's nice to see who's...  So they replaced it with a big, thick, black bar that goes completely across the windows.  It is so bad.  Yeah.  We were talking about it last week.  You just can't...  It is so intrusive to your line of sight.  And of course they couldn't get this right.  Of course.  It's got to go.  It really does.  You want to nominate E-Rock? 
[00:07:00]  E-Rock, can you rip that shit down?  Oh, no.  E-Rock, yeah.  No, I'm serious.  I sure can.  All right.  Go rip that shit down.  There it is.  And put it in a big pile right outside our studio.  They kept saying, we're going to have the decals ready.  Remember, they kept giving you, like...  Oh, we have the decals ready next week.  Those decals are coming.  And they asked, like, people were asking about it.  There we go.  Yeah.  Wow.  That peels right off.  It just goes to show you.  It's like...  All right.  Leave that one.  Leave that one.  Oh, you can't hear, right?  Leave that one.  Because that's fine over there. 
[00:07:30]  Just get rid of the other one over there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  And now it's all crinkled.  Crinkly.  You tell them to put the...  That's...  Look at the difference that fucking makes.  Bravo.  As far as opening up the window and...  Yeah, just don't leave that one.  What does he do?  What does Jimmy tell me?  Oh, man.  Oh, it smells good.  What does it smell like?  Colorforms?  Yeah, I love it.  Oh, it's like Colorforms?  It smells great.  Oh, no. 
[00:08:00]  It smells like...  Let me smell.  Wow, that is kind of like industrial waste.  Oh, shit.  That's going to get you high.  That shit will get you high.  I like this smell.  That shit will get you fucked up.  That shit will get you high.  There you go.  We're back to normal now.  Oh, I like this smell.  I might as well rip the other one down, too.  What the fuck?  Yeah, take it, then.  That's where most of the pictures are taken.  Huh?  That's where most of the photos are taken.  All right.  You know, that is true.  That's fine, because...  Yeah, the pictures are taken right there.  So, fuck it.  If you guys want, I can just hold it when it's gone.  Yeah.  Don't be up. 
[00:08:30]  Don't be up.  That's not coming back.  Don't be up.  Don't be up.  Don't be up.  You think they can put that back on the window?  Yeah, I think that's a little crunched up.  A little sticky.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, just leave it like that and stick it on the window.  Jimmy, put the...  It's like...  It's rolled up in a ball, because it's all sticky, and now it's just stuck on the window.  Club Story Kenny's OCD is kicking in.  He's flattening out the wrinkles on the other sticker.  He's freaking out with that one.  I need to flatten this out. 
[00:09:00]  Is that better?  That's perfect.  That's fucking rules.  Look how ghetto it is.  Good.  We're just assholes.  But everyone was in agreement, right?  That shit was dumb.  That was terrible.  Terrible.  All right, good.  I can't see that damage.  I like that they did something, but it was a little bit...  It's kind of nice when they do something, I guess, right?  Yeah, yeah.  They love doing something.  They love doing something.  How are you guys, man? 
[00:09:30]  All righty.  Yeah?  Yeah, how was vacay?  It was good.  Yeah?  Way too fucking relaxing.  Oh, fucking vacations are great.  You want to go back on another one?  I'd have to...  What?  Yeah.  Vacation?  Yeah, let's fuck it up.  Fuck yeah.  Let's fuck it up!  Fuck it.  They don't know yet, but I have to go to a wedding out in California.  Cali?  It's the weekend right before we're going to...  Cleveland?  That weekend.  April, whatever the fuck.  Are you able to go to Cleveland?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, I just... 
[00:10:00]  I have to leave, like...  I think I got to leave Thursday, and then I'm coming back Sunday, so it's like a Thursday  and Friday.  Nice.  Saturday, Sunday, and then I come back Monday.  21st?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that one.  Good for you, man.  So, hey, Travis, if you're listening, yeah, that, that.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that.  I went to our old stomping ground, the good old Turks and Caicos.  Yeah.  I walked through Club Med, too.  Did you see Hendel?  I didn't see Hendel.  Yeah, that's where all that shit went down. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, Hendel, it's all good.  But I don't know what's going on with Club Med.  I think it's more chill now or something, because I walked through just to kind of bring  back some memories from the old days.  We've told the stories over the years.  Yeah.  Because I was staying down the beach, and I don't know, man.  It seemed like, kind of like...  Keto?  The people seemed older.  Ha, ha, ha.  I mean, we're old, but they seemed older.  Like, Club Med, I just assumed should be, like, the age should never change, right?  Well, that's true.  They should have the same people, the same age people working there, and then the same 
[00:11:00]  age people kind of going there.  Yeah, because wasn't it, like, 20s to mid-30s tops?  Definitely.  Man, they seemed older than that, and there was no, like, party feel to the whole place.  I don't think people that age have the income these days to go out.  Is that what's going on?  So you're getting older people everywhere.  And there weren't a lot of people, and the whole place needs a good paint job.  I think it's the same exact place from the old Sam Adams trips.  Ah, this recession's getting everybody, huh?  I guess. 
[00:11:30]  But all I did was fucking chill.  I don't even have vacation stories.  You know, when you come back, and you're like, oh, cool, I got a few stories.  I have nothing.  I did this.  I did this.  I did that.  Well, I bitched about it on Twitter.  Like, it's all about rum down there.  They put rum in fucking everything.  And then you realize rum sucks unless you're on vacation.  Do you drink rum when you're not on vacation?  Captain Morgan, I like.  Oh, yeah, I guess you're right.  Fucking that, because it's sweet, you know?  But none of that rum punch shit, right? 
[00:12:00]  No, none of that shit.  I don't like straight rum.  I don't like Bacardi and Coke, to me.  It's like, eh.  But when you're on vacation, rum drinks, you know, they're kind of tasty.  I don't know.  Is it the sun?  Is it the fucking blue water?  Is it the palm trees?  You do get roped into the whole atmosphere.  So, you know, you don't just take little pieces of it.  You take the whole thing.  Right.  The rum drinks.  Right.  The dumb fucking braids.  Braids.  No, they don't have those animals walking around the beaches yet.  Nope.  That's why I still go there. 
[00:12:30]  As soon as those fucking animals start walking the beaches with the braids and everything else,  I'm out of there.  You want a nice curchief for you, Miss Lady?  No, shut up.  I'm trying to lay here on the beach.  There's other places you can't go anymore because they bother you so much you can't relax.  You're trying to lay down on the beach and constantly they're coming up asking you for shite.  All sorts of shite.  The necklaces, the fucking bracelets, the fucking hair thing.  So fucking you want a banana boat ride thing. 
[00:13:00]  That guy.  Jet ski.  Fucking, yeah.  Rags that they're selling.  Shoes.  Hats.  Fucking.  Enough.  I just want to.  The reason I came here isn't to have somebody fucking hawking their wares.  Because it's to sit on a beach and enjoy myself.  You know, Tercy Cacos was starting to change and then the fucking economy did what it did.  Took a shite.  You know what, though?  But places like that, nice.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:13:30]  Because, you know, from the airport to where I was staying, they're like, yeah, they had a shutdown construction down here.  So we got stuff that's half done.  Which is good because you don't want, like, the place you go, you don't want to get over the top developed.  Yeah, yeah.  Let other islands do that shit.  So in a way.  A lot of the islands do have half-built houses on them.  I don't know why.  Who told the reason for that?  Because there's taxes not paid until it's finished.  Oh, right.  We never said that on the air, did we?  I'm not sure.  Because we're making fun of, where the fuck was it? 
[00:14:00]  This goes back a couple weeks.  It's like all those islands.  But you make it over somewhere?  Yeah, and someone wrote us and said they'd get a tax write-off if their house isn't complete.  So they're like, fuck that.  So they just put a roof on and a couple sides and that's it.  It's all good.  Yeah, but they don't have the people walking around with their braids and shit.  Yeah, that's great.  And the water's still really blue down there.  Yeah.  Turquoise.  Turquoise blue.  A color blue you just don't see anywhere.  Was the water warm?  Oh, God, dude. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, was it warm.  Oh, my God.  So nice to get away from this brutal New York winter.  Well, when you go away, you check the weather back home and I was cursing you guys.  I'm like, seriously?  Because you want to take one of those weeks of winter and go, goodbye.  That's one week I don't have to worry about the cold.  I'm at breakfast.  It's like, really?  It's going to be 70 in New York today, you motherfuckers.  Yeah, there is.  It's only going to be 85 here.  It is very selfish to think, like, I want you guys to get a fucking shitty cold spell or snow or something. 
[00:15:00]  Because you want to blow out one of your winter weeks.  Yeah, you come back, everything's fine, and then you're like, ah, see, I didn't have to deal with that.  Like, I woke up early every morning because of our hours.  I was up on the resort.  I was the first fucking loser up every morning, bothering the fucking people trying to set up for the breakfast and the buffet.  So, how are you doing?  I just want to get a cup of coffee and walk the beach.  I was walking the beach before the sun came up every morning.  I was the first fucking loser.  Yeah.  And I was sleeping in. 
[00:15:30]  I was getting up at 6.  My point, though, you weren't nervous being on the beach, right?  Like, there's no crime there.  That's why I like it, too.  Yeah.  You feel completely safe where I was.  When you go to the Nassau Bahamas, you better watch out when you're walking that beach, especially early in the morning or late in the day.  Yeah.  You better know where the fuck you're walking.  Going to get jacked.  Yeah, it's a little scarier down there where I used to stay.  Yeah.  So, I read Keith Richards' book, Life. 
[00:16:00]  How's that?  530 pages.  Did you read on the beach?  I read it everywhere.  I mean everywhere.  On the beach, in the water, in the pool, in my bed, on my balcony.  That was my thing.  Did the kid like the beach and the water and stuff?  He fucking loved it.  Right.  Speaking of the kid, my kid traveled perfectly.  And I'm not trying to say that I have a perfect kid, trust me.  But I lucked out.  I didn't have the kid screaming and yelling on the plane, thank God, because we were fucking worried about that. 
[00:16:30]  He flew down there perfect, and he flew back perfect.  But I was telling Anthony just before the – did I tell you this yet?  I'm not sure.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I don't think so.  So –  About the people who went down?  Uh-huh.  You might have.  Yeah, I think you were telling me.  Which part?  Not that one.  Oh, no?  What people?  Firemen.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  There's a couple things.  Okay.  But my – on the way back, he flies great.  We go through customs.  We get our baggage.  We get our car.  I'm like, holy fuck, this worked out perfect.  Why were we worried to travel with the kid, right? 
[00:17:00]  We're two blocks from home in the car that Kenny set up for me that you use.  Oh, yeah, Ruby.  The Tonight Show guy, Ruby.  Yeah.  In his fucking Mercedes SUV brand fucking new car.  He's got a car seat.  And I'm sitting back with my wife and my kid going, oh, my God, this worked out great for us.  This is awesome.  We can now travel, right?  Oh, no.  Dude, we're two blocks from the house and my kid starts powerbooting all over his brand new car. 
[00:17:30]  I was that close to having the perfect trip with my almost two-year-old.  Oh.  I was two blocks.  Literally.  Oh, no.  Right around Jubilee.  I mean, it was that close.  It was that close.  And I get picked up in that one sometimes.  Oh, no.  Dude, it was that close.  I was bragging to everyone like, oh, my God, look at my kid.  He wasn't the one yelling.  He traveled great.  We're coming home.  This is great.  Can't wait to go upstairs. 
[00:18:00]  Chill out.  Dude, powerbooting like a hose.  And I've never seen my kid do that before.  His little stomach is probably upset from the flight and all the travel.  Yeah.  Car sickness.  A little tummy.  Yeah.  And by the way, that car will be clean because Ruby's OCD.  Like, literally, as far as his car being clean, that fucking car, he'll rip out everything and wipe it down.  Well, he wasn't – he didn't show any OCD tendencies.  No.  He was trying to – he was like, oh, it's okay.  It's okay because my wife's, like, scrubbing. 
[00:18:30]  I'm scrubbing.  We're like, fuck this.  You know, we don't want to be the assholes that just leave.  And then I just pull out – you know, I get the reputation of being cheap, but I'm not cheap.  I pulled out my fucking wallet, and I'm just peeling off.  Like, I'm just trying to figure out in my mind how much I have to give this guy to make this problem go away.  And just handed him a shitload of money and said, fuck, I'm sorry.  Yeah, he'll have a detail.  And he's like, no, it's cool, man.  It happens.  You're not the first – this isn't the first time this has happened.  I'm like, yeah, right. 
[00:19:00]  A kid powerbooting two blocks from the – where you're dropping them off.  Almost made it.  Two blocks, not three, not four, two.  We're at a stop sign.  You know exactly where we were.  I will say so much of a better story would have been as we're taking off to go down to vacation.  Oh, shit.  Powerbooting on the plane.  My wife said, can you imagine if that happened on the fucking plane?  You just got to – and it does happen.  I wouldn't even know what to do.  You just got to fucking get a –  I wouldn't even know what to do.  Parents – people would be a little freaked out, but parents probably wouldn't be because every parent has had their kid fucking puke all over the place. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  You just got to fucking wipe it up.  What are you going to do?  Yeah.  Yep.  Now clean it up!  But was he crying, puking, or just sitting – because kids can puke and not fucking bat an eye.  It's like they just – like they mean to do it.  They're just sitting there relaxed.  They're just vomiting it.  Oh, yeah.  That's what happened.  He was confused.  Like, what the fuck is this?  So, I thought I was going to come back here with the – my kid is great story, but two blocks from the fucking house.  Two blocks.  Two blocks.  It's got to be a kid at some point. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, the other thing with the planes.  Yeah.  We usually fly Saturday to Saturday, but I decided to stretch it this year.  If I flew Saturday, I would have been out of my mind because what happened – I guess down there, the firemen went on strike on Saturday.  And if you're – if the firemen are on strike, you're not allowed to deplane.  What the fuck?  You can't – like, if you could land a plane, you can't get off it?  What is that?  I don't know.  Is that Union shit down there, too?  Yeah, they do.  And it's a little island that's becoming more than a little island.  So, what happened, because we heard all the stories with other people around the resort, they actually turned planes around. 
[00:20:30]  Some went to, like, the Dominican and Republican stuff.  Those guys got off easy.  Some planes, they went from Newark all the way down to Turks and Caicos.  It's easy three-and-a-half-hour flight.  They were either on the runway or in airspace and were told to turn the fuck around and go all the way back to Newark.  Could you imagine?  That would be –  You do your three-and-a-half-hour flight.  You're ready to start your vacation.  They're like, nah. 
[00:21:00]  And they go all the way back to Newark.  And then the pilot's like, he wants to, like, call it a day because I guess he wanted to go home.  This didn't happen to me, by the way.  Thank God, because we left Friday.  And he was ready to call it, and all of a sudden they got word that the strike's over.  It was like a fucking half-day strike or something.  So, the guy's like, well, strike's over.  We're being cleared to take off again.  So, then they went back.  Can you imagine?  Newark, Turks and Caicos, back to Newark, then back to Turks and Caicos.  The rage.  I would have lost my mind. 
[00:21:30]  But then the relief, like –  You would have been relieved?  Yeah, in a weird way because you lose 12 hours, but your whole vacation's not ruined.  Yeah.  Like, all right, the first day got fucked up.  It could have been – because I guarantee you people were saying to themselves, hey, look, you know what?  Sometimes you have weather delays.  This is just – we'll look at this like it was a big weather delay.  It's seven hours, but fuck it.  We're going to get down there.  It's – that's grounds, though, for, like, rushing the door and jumping off the plane and just running.  Oh, yeah.  And trying to get to vacation.  Oh, yeah.  Like, no, I'm leaving this fucking plane. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, yeah.  We're here.  We're fucking here.  And then a lot of people saying they were in Newark on a plane for two to almost that three-hour mark waiting to see what the fuck, you know?  And then a lot of people saying they got more info on their phones than what they'll tell you.  In this day and age when you can get your info from your phone, why aren't the people getting on the fucking loudspeaker there and giving you some kind of heads up?  It's common courtesy, right?  Yeah.  You know who you feel bad for in those moments?  Smokers.  Smokers because guys that tell themselves, like, all right, fuck it, three and a half, four hours. 
[00:22:30]  I can do this.  What?  We got to go back.  Yeah, you just – you give yourself enough time.  You know it's only that much time.  And then you're like, fuck Charks and Kekos.  I got to smoke.  And you'll end.  What?  Four more hours?  Wouldn't you take your heel and just try to kick out that little window?  Something, yeah.  Oh, well, look what happened to the plane.  Ah, it wasn't me.  I swear.  I, you know, I'm in another world these days, but I feel sorry for the parents.  I can't imagine because, I mean, with us, it's like, okay, we got three and a half hours. 
[00:23:00]  Three and a half hours with our kid on the plane.  Imagine, imagine 10 to 12 hours.  I would have –  Man.  I know I would have been the guy losing my mind.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I couldn't imagine.  Would you have been cool?  No.  Newark, Turks and Kekos, back to Newark, then back to Turks and Kekos.  No.  You're on the plane probably at that point close to 12 hours when it's all said and done.  I've been losing it.  Imagine the plane fucking starts going down on its way back to Turks and Kekos. 
[00:23:30]  You'd be like, see?  See?  Right.  Would have been fine.  I would have been on vacation.  Now I'm plummeting.  Now I'm dead.  I don't want to plummet.  Right.  I wanted to drink some rum.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah.  That's about it.  It's just a chill vacation.  That's good.  That's always good.  I like those vacations where you could just lay down.  No one's hassling you.  The man ain't hassling you.  Chill.  It was just chill, man.  Just swimming, walking, watching my kid play in the pool. 
[00:24:00]  That was literally it.  Did you eat good or did you have any fucking...  I tried to eat good, you know?  It's hard.  Fuck yeah.  It's hard.  There's food all the fucking time, man.  But they put rum in everything.  Why?  I don't know.  I like that conch.  They got conch down there.  Conch is great.  Conch is...  Conch!  Conch!  That's something black people use to straighten their hair.  What?  Conch?  That's what the term for that stuff is.  No way, Jose.  Conch, you conch your hair.  Really?  Am I right or wrong, Sam?  There's this conch shell and what's inside, that meat is fucking delicious. 
[00:24:30]  But for some reason, they can't figure out how to ship it to New York.  So you only eat it on vacation.  And if it's done right, it's awesome.  But they fucked it up in my resort.  They decide they need to put mayo on it or some shit.  What?  I don't know.  I like conch chowder.  Yeah, well, they had that.  Conch fritters.  Can they not give it to New York?  Or will the FDA just not let it in?  Yeah, exactly.  It's oysters who have died of cancer.  I don't know.  I think...  I mean, we get everything else, so I think it's just uber sensitive or something and can't 
[00:25:00]  travel.  I don't know.  Because I've tried it in New York.  Every once in a while, you'll find a place and it just fucking tastes like rubber.  It sucks.  I've never heard of it.  You've never heard of it?  No.  You've seen the conch shell.  That's what it looks like.  Yeah, it's those shells that they fucking...  It's a big fucking tumor looking thing when you pull it out of the shell.  But that shit's delicious.  It's all cute.  Not that thing even alive.  I don't know.  A little green and red peppers.  A little onion.  A little lime.  A little, like, lime and a little, maybe, vinegar. 
[00:25:30]  You throw in your sugar.  You're good there.  Do they bite?  Good to go.  In real life, do conchs bite?  No.  They do have to find bigger shells.  I think they actually slide out.  Put in all your sausages.  Sausages.  Who picks that up and just puts their finger in the shell and goes, oh, no, this thing doesn't  bite?  Like, who figures that out?  They're fucking sea monsters.  Like, the first people that saw that probably thought the rock, there's a rock, now it's  walking at me.  Yeah.  The fucking earth is attacking me.  A rock.  I don't know. 
[00:26:00]  It's horrifying.  But it was all about the rum, and I guess we've gone to this place a bunch of times,  but they got a French chef, so the French love their mayo products.  Yeah, they really do.  They love putting cream in everything, which I wanted to, I didn't want to be that guy,  but I wanted to go to the manager of the place and go, it's stupid to have mayo products  in your food.  It's 85 degrees down here.  You can't keep mayo.  And I think my wife might have got a little of it.  Oh, shit.  A little of the 24-hour food poisoning shit. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, yeah.  Because probably the mayo was out too long.  What if the seafood, you never know.  Even though you're by the ocean, you don't know how they, you know.  Yeah.  Why was she, she had a 24-hour bug?  Oh, boy, did she.  Oh, yeah.  I think it was the mayo.  Maybe your son had that.  Huh?  Maybe he got something.  Maybe he ate a little something that didn't agree with him and fucking got lucky and he  just didn't.  Yeah.  Two blocks from the house.  Oh, I know people are laughing at me.  That's funny.  Especially because I know Ruby.  And he takes me, I don't usually go in that one. 
[00:27:00]  He has a Mercedes.  It's 10 years old.  Right.  And it looks like it just came off the showroom floor.  That's a 10-year-old car?  Wait, were you in the car or the SUV?  SUV.  No.  I've gotten in that, but I've gotten in the car.  No, no, no.  There's a car he has.  Because if this thing was 10 years old, then he's got a major fucking problem.  No, there's a car he has.  No car should look like that after 10 years.  He has a car with like 230,000 miles on it.  It looks like it came off.  I couldn't believe.  I thought it was two years old or he was old.  He's a great guy.  He's great.  He should play poker then because he wasn't letting on that he was bothered. 
[00:27:30]  He might not have.  And if he has OCD and this power boot all over your car, I would have lost my mind.  I only think he has it about his vehicles.  He doesn't seem like an OCD guy, but I'm saying the car is in such perfect condition.  I can fucking drive you crazy on some level.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know, it's like, oh, it's okay.  It's a good fuck.  Driving to the – I don't even know if this – I'll try to see if this works. 
[00:28:00]  But some lady was driving us to the airport yesterday.  And, you know, it's like a 20-minute ride, so I'm doing some small talk with her.  And I always – I'm curious.  I'm like, you know, do you ever drive celebrities and stuff?  And she goes, oh, yeah, but down here, you know, the reason why celebrities come is because, you know,  they want to get away.  And we understand that down here so we don't bother them, right?  I'm like, oh, really?  Who have you had in the car?  And most people at that point would go, oh, you know, that's what Ruby said, matter of fact,  because I asked him the same shit. 
[00:28:30]  And he goes, I don't want to, you know, basically, trust me, big-time A-listers,  but I'd rather not give names.  I'm like, that's cool.  You're clientless.  Let's talk about something else.  That's cool.  You know, I figured I'd ask.  So I asked the same question to this lady driving us to the airport.  And she's trying to be cool.  Like, yeah, but that's why people come down here because us locals,  we don't give a crap about celebrities, right?  I'm like, so who have you had?  She goes, Cindy Crawford.  And then proceeds – I know more about Cindy Crawford now  than I've had my entire life from a lady who said, yeah, we're like – 
[00:29:00]  we understand we don't care.  Yeah.  I know now that Cindy Crawford looks like shit.  I know that she doesn't like her family.  I know all this shit.  Oh, man, and she just starts bashing her?  Right.  That's hilarious.  But the whole time going, but that's why they come here,  because, you know, we don't care who we drive around.  Yeah, they love it down here.  We're not like the, oh, that piece of shit.  And then –  Oh, Cindy Crawford.  I'm thinking Cindy Lauper.  No, Cindy Crawford.  Robert Crawford.  Wait a minute.  It's old.  The model, man. 
[00:29:30]  I guess the resort we were at, she stayed at a few years ago.  Look, this is all I know.  And it was some kind of family reunion.  And Cindy Crawford's like couldn't stand her family,  so she called this lady to get her the fuck out of there for the day.  Oh, man.  So this lady brought her to the other side of the island to another resort.  Cindy Crawford stayed there all day, brought her back,  and then Cindy Crawford gave her her cell number or got her cell number.  They exchanged numbers, whatever.  And then Cindy Crawford called the next day, and this lady claiming, you know,  she's so cool and doesn't care about celebrities, the phone rings. 
[00:30:00]  And she goes, hello.  And Cindy Crawford goes, hi, it's Cindy.  And this lady supposedly goes, Cindy who?  Oh, yeah.  A day later.  Cindy who?  I'm like, oh, really?  Yeah, you're trying to show me how cool you are,  and you don't give a fuck about celebrities.  She's diddling herself to the thought of knowing Cindy.  And then she went shut up about Cindy Crawford.  But the whole time was under the guise that we let leave celebrities alone.  So then I go, who else have you driven?  And then she gives me a laundry list.  Oh, Shaq, Rondo, all the Super Bowl players were down here after the Super Bowl. 
[00:30:30]  But we don't care.  Right.  But we don't care.  Ugh.  Believe me, she's talking.  I hated her.  This week, wait till she's eight.  And the man in bringing baby, and the baby vomits all over the car.  Oh, Lord.  We was two blocks from the hotel, and the baby vomited, and it won't stop.  I hate Jamaican.  You know what?  I wish my baby puked in her car instead of poor Rubio. 
[00:31:00]  He called me the next day, and I'm like, Opie, ooh, I don't know no Opie.  I'll be right over, sir.  Opie, ooh, I'll be right over.  Yeah, Ruby, but there's no Opie.  Ruby, Ruby, Ruby.  Yeah, I wish my kid puked in this lady's car that doesn't care about celebrities, and  then proceeds to completely give it all away.  I mean, completely.  Gave up everybody.  She's a rat.  She is a rat.  Fucking family rats.  Fucking rat.  Scungilly is a conk.  Is that true?  Scungilly?  I have no idea. 
[00:31:30]  I know a calamar is a squid.  I don't know if I've ever had a scungilly.  Scungilly?  Scungilly.  I don't know.  I never heard of that.  I've heard of scungilly, but I never ate it, I don't think.  Sounds like something that they would try to feed me when I was a child, and I would cry.  Yeah.  I don't want that.  And then the only other thing I did, like, when my kid was, uh...  Oh, it was full of conk.  It is?  Yes, it is.  No shit.  Scungilly.  I might have to try some scungilly.  How do they fuck it up, though?  They put it in a red sauce. 
[00:32:00]  No, no, no.  You gotta make it like my mother used to make the scungilly.  Oh, you melt in your mouth.  Isn't it a red sauce?  Oh, I remember Pop Pop would wail her across the face with the shell.  If she didn't cook it right, we all laugh.  Scungilly.  Oh, the way my mother would make it a scungilly, and then Pop would pound his pinky-ring fist  right into her fucking face.  He'd get his whole hand right into that shell, and he'd use it like a boxing glove, and he'd  knock mama's teeth out. 
[00:32:30]  Scungilly.  Yeah, I guess scungilly's a conk.  There you go.  You'll learn something new.  Very good.  And then the only other thing, when my kid napped, I got to go to the adult pool.  My God, what a treat that was.  What's going on in the adult pool?  Egg drop soup in the skimmers?  I literally was just watching, and I finally got like a 12-second video.  I literally was watching a fat woman.  This is for the people that don't follow me on Twitter, so I have to say it here. 
[00:33:00]  She has to be at least 300 pounds.  She was in a bikini with massive boobs.  Yeah.  Massive.  She looked like one of those big, fucking, tough, eastern block women.  And her husband was a skinny little guy.  She was black, though, right?  No.  Oh, I thought she was a black woman.  No.  I saw a black woman in that pool.  She might have been, um, she might have been a little, uh, she might have been a little  Greek.  Oh, yeah?  Maybe a little Greek.  A Greek?  I don't know what she was, to be honest with you. 
[00:33:30]  She wasn't black, though.  Oh.  She was definitely like, uh, European.  And I was fucking howling to myself, because I just watched this thing go in and out of  the pool, and just watch.  Oh, yeah.  I thought she was like light-skinned.  Watch how much water leaves the pool when she fucking swims in.  Watch this.  Wow.  That's funny.  It's like that tsunami footage of Japan, when it comes over the wall and gets the cars.  That's funny.  That's why I call it Big Bikini Pool Tsunami. 
[00:34:00]  I was just sitting there watching her over and over again.  The amount of water that left this damn pool, it was just, I was cracking up to myself.  I'm like, you're such a loser.  And then I finally filmed her.  Put it on our Facebook page, Iraq, if you can, Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  That's the adult pool right there?  Yeah.  Nice.  Nice, man.  That's where I did most of my reading.  It looks warm.  Reading's weird.  Reading's weird.  Reading's stupid.  Reading's stupid.  I used to love reading books.  I was a big-time reader, and then, I don't know, maybe having a kid and stuff, I kind 
[00:34:30]  of had to push that aside.  So when I started reading this book, I had to get my reading muscles back.  I'm reading, and I'm like, what, did I just read?  I was reading the same page over and over again, and then I couldn't even follow the lines for  a while.  And then finally, my muscles got back, and I read like a champ.  But at first, it was like trying to fucking figure it out again.  Yeah.  Do you not understand?  Because you're reading, but you're not comprehending anything. 
[00:35:00]  You're thinking about other shit.  Because everything's in snippets now.  It's hard for me to get through a book now.  I have to make myself do it, or I'll read one, and I'll try it.  It's because you're so used to seeing everything on Twitter snippets and fucking brief online  Facebook.  Everything is so fast now that to sit down and...  Right.  It's harder to go through a book than it used to be.  And when you turn a page and you see a whole page where there's no paragraphs...  You're just...  Oh, it's going to be...  Oh, it's going to be work.  This page is going to be brutal.  I'm going to have a panic attack. 
[00:35:30]  Don't you love when you see the page?  It's the end of the chapter, and that's a whole fucking page you don't have to read.  But fucking Keith did the one thing I hate about books.  He has a lot of pictures, which I love.  Like, he has three different picture sections, I think, or at least two.  And each one is about, I don't know, like 10 pages.  Easy.  So I'm like, okay, page 208.  Now I get to look at some pictures, and I get to pick up the book at 220.  Yeah, yeah.  And then you're like, oh, a lot of pages there.  2-0-fucking-9 after the pictures are done. 
[00:36:00]  He doesn't count the pictures.  Oh.  Always pages.  Well, still, isn't it still the same amount of pages?  Yeah.  Of reading?  Yeah.  You don't get any credit?  No, but some...  But some authors and books understand that you want a little break, and you could go from  208 to 220 with a little picture watching.  This is like Nigel Tufnell with the amps going to 11.  It's like, but...  But logically, that makes sense.  Can't you just make 10 louder and keep 10 the loudest?  But some people understand that, and they give you a little break. 
[00:36:30]  He's got to 11.  And you could jump forward.  You're like, holy fuck, I just time-traveled from 208 to 220.  This is nice.  This makes you feel a little better.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  All righty.  And, you know, Keith didn't...  He didn't write a word for this fucking book.  No?  He talked into it.  I think he just talked and...  Yeah.  You could tell when it's a talkie.  Yeah, yeah.  Ghostwriter?  Do you think he had a ghostwriter?  No, I don't think it was a ghostwriter, because you absolutely feel like you're reading 
[00:37:00]  his voice.  Is it a ghostwriter?  He didn't write it down.  He just talked it to a fucking tape recorder or whatever, and then someone edited the shit.  Was the ghostwriter in the sky?  If you hear ghostwriters in the sky, it's...  Oh, boy.  What's he doing, right in the clouds or something?  Ah, Chip.  Hey, no, but is that a ghostwriter, too?  If, say, he talks it to somebody...  Right.  Flavor Flavie's book was written by him, but it sounded like it was...  There's no way it was written by him.  No, but it sounded like it was dictated by him.  It sounded spoken.  Yeah, right.  But is that a ghostwriter or no? 
[00:37:30]  I don't know.  Maybe that's classified as a ghostwriter.  No, that's just an editor at that point, I think.  Oh, okay.  See, they wanted...  They wanted...  We almost wrote a book.  Ugh.  That deal.  And then Bob thought this guy that knew nothing about us was going to, like, help us out,  and then the guy wanted to write the book, I'm like, no, we're going to write our own  book.  I have a mental block of all that.  But he wanted...  He wanted to write the book.  I'm like, no, we write the book.  You might maybe direct us a little bit, but we write the book. 
[00:38:00]  Can I tell you that?  I don't understand these people that don't write their own books.  That would have been the easiest book on the planet.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That would have been a very easy book.  Well, Bob fucked it up.  He insisted that...  Yeah, whatever.  Yeah, he didn't do a good job.  He wanted more than he deserved.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm back to this shit.  When's the next plane of Turks?  Welcome.  Welcome home.  When's the next plane?  I want to go to Pirate K next.  Where?  That's where the Keith Richards lives, and that's where the Bruce Willis lives. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, yeah?  Tiny little island that has nothing but a few really nice houses.  I think a loudmouth cab driver's there, too.  Oh, yeah, she would tell me all about that, too.  I know everyone that lives on Pirate K, because this woman that doesn't care about celebrities.  A good thing she doesn't care.  She doesn't care, though.  They're just regular people to her.  Sure, just like you and me.  You know, they put their shoes on one at a time.  Yeah.  What?  What did Sarah Silverman say one time?  I'm just like you.  I put my $500 pants on one leg at a time. 
[00:39:00]  That's a good one.  That's really good.  I didn't drop logs in the water, though.  Oh.  I didn't shit on the beach.  I peed a lot, though.  Well, peeing in the water, that's fine.  The fish love it.  You know what I noticed about the family pool?  Oh.  Oh, shit.  I do have one more story.  Oh, fuck.  Dump in the pool?  Well.  Oh, boy.  This is what happens with the family pool, I've noticed.  Like, guys like us, we're older.  We got to pee a lot, right?  You don't see one fucking guy leave the pool to go pee. 
[00:39:30]  That's true.  Well, they're all peeing in the pool.  Got to be.  Sure.  But guess what?  The kids always leave and go, Mom, I got to go pee.  And you see them run off.  They're doing the right thing.  And then you look around, you see the parents, and they're never leaving the pool.  They never leave the pool.  That means they're peeing.  Which, by the way, I was, too.  Well, yeah.  Do you pee in the pool?  I think you just know that people piss in the pool.  There's nothing you can really do about it.  You hope that the chemicals kind of counteract.  Right. 
[00:40:00]  And the parts per million, really.  Who the fuck doesn't pee in the pool?  What's it doing, really?  But you worry more about the kids, but they're actually doing the right thing.  They fucking run out and go, I got to make pee-pees or whatever the fuck they say.  I got to make wee-wees.  Wee-wees, and they leave.  But my kid had a swim diaper on.  Uh-oh.  Let one go in it?  Well, I was holding them and stuff, and swimming around in the deep end, and all of a sudden  I see explosive diarrhea coming out of his fucking head. 
[00:40:30]  Oh!  Ah, shit!  You inside?  Oh, yeah.  And I lifted them out of the water just in time, meaning only some got into the pool.  Ah.  And I didn't want to be the guy that had to tell anyone, because I didn't want to be the  reason why they shut down the pool for a day.  Oh, no.  But that's what they do.  They shut it down, because they think you can catch something.  They need to get more chemicals in there.  Oh, no.  But I couldn't be that guy.  It was late in the week.  I knew everyone at that point.  She just went and called anonymously.  Ah.  A baby has shit in the pool.  And there was just kind of yellowish diarrhea kind of floating on the top. 
[00:41:00]  But it started to kind of...  Oh, God.  That's disgusting.  It started to dissipate.  And then within like two minutes, it was like there was nothing in there anymore.  So I figured everything was good.  Invisible fucking sickness.  Whoa.  But some asshole couple from Oklahoma, they noticed.  They were giving me the dirty eye.  Good.  Wow.  And I marched my son to the ocean and cleaned him up proper.  Healed.  Like the Indians used to do.  Like the Indians. 
[00:41:30]  Wipe his little ass in the ocean.  Clean out his swimmies.  And we were right back in that pool.  Oh, man.  Well, I don't care.  It's my son's poo.  I can handle that.  I can't handle anyone else's poo, though.  Yeah, just thinking that.  That probably happens all the time.  You wouldn't have got back in the water, Ant?  No.  Never.  I was thinking about you.  I'm like, Ant would not be happy right now.  That would have been it.  I've been back on the plane.  Come on.  Take me back to Newark. 
[00:42:00]  That's it, really.  We're supposed to come back with like vacation stories.  I really fucking didn't do anything.  Sometimes on vacation, you just relax.  Exactly.  Fucking sit there.  That's what I like doing on vacation.  Now then.  Well, one thing my wife has taught me is just to fucking chill out finally, man.  I know you're looking at me weird like, really?  But yeah, man.  I'm a much chiller guy these days.  And on vacation, I always felt like I had a fucking, all right, what are we doing next?  Snorkel trip?  Should we do this?  What do we...  And now I'm just sitting there like, no, man. 
[00:42:30]  I'm just going to fucking chill out for hours around the pool and do nothing.  And it's a better way to be, I think.  I like doing nothing like that because it's something.  You're doing something.  You're there.  Right.  It's nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, I don't, I don't like going on vacation and feel like you have to do all the activities  and fucking hiking and this.  Well.  I kind of like just laying down on the beach and fucking drinking.  And I mean, until my kid's a little older, I'm going to be, you know, stuck anyway. 
[00:43:00]  You know, I can't do all that shit with a two-year-old.  Yeah.  But I'm going to get there.  Yeah.  I'll go back to diving, hopefully, and all that shit.  I didn't dive.  Turks and Caicos is where I like diving, too.  Yeah, the water's crystal clear.  They got the fucking shelf where you go out and it drops down almost a mile.  Yeah.  You get to take a little peek.  A peek into the abyss.  Dude.  You realize that your life means fucking nothing.  You're nothing.  When you're like almost, in my case, about 100 feet down, and then they take you over 
[00:43:30]  the shelf and you realize there's just fucking vastness out there that you have no idea about.  Is it scary going over the shelf?  Like, it is horrifying.  Like, like, swimming over it.  It's almost like you're stepping off.  But you know what?  It's cool as shit.  It's a darkness because you're looking and you're looking across an ocean, basically.  Yeah.  So that's dark as shit.  And then you look down and that's dark as shit.  And then you look back to where you're, you got to go back to and it's nice and lit up 
[00:44:00]  because the sun's coming down and hitting the fucking, you know, the sand 100 feet down.  Did you go down?  When you went over the shelf, did you go down a little bit?  I'm a loser.  I've dove close to 40 times and I'm still not certified.  So I still have to take fucking, you know, courses.  So you're only a lot down.  Some will sneak me down a little further because they know I've been.  How far down can you go?  Some of the guys are like cowboys and they go down close to 200 feet.  That's pretty far.  That's pretty far, I think. 
[00:44:30]  I think that's about right.  Someone can help me out.  I think that's it before you really start to chance and shit.  When you go over the edge, you're going to like, you're stuck in some vortex where you  can't get back up.  Because you're, yeah, because you're.  Oh, that's creepy.  You don't.  When you're diving, you got to really pay attention because all of a sudden you could be, I mean,  in those cases, a lot further down without realizing if you're not, you know, focusing  on your instruments.  How far is the bends?  Oh, that's, that's a whole nother thing.  That depends on how long you've been underwater, how far you've been down, all that shit.  How fast you come up. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, you got to come up really slow and take breaks.  That's, that's what, if you don't do that, that's what causes the bends.  That's like the basics of that.  Would you go in one of those diving bells that takes you, like those automatic things that  take you down to the bottom to the Titanic?  Fuck yeah.  In a second.  I'd be so scared the fucking thing would just go, duck, duck, duck, duck.  Oh yeah.  And break and then you're stuck down there.  Yeah, but that's how I feel when I fly.  Same shit.  Can they get you up when you're fucking, is there a string tethering you?  There's not, right?  A string.  I love how Jimmy talks.  There's not though, right? 
[00:45:30]  A string.  Some, I guess some have.  The deep sea diver guys.  Yeah, yeah.  Do they have a fucking, when you're one of those automatic things that they take you down  and it's like, what the fuck, man?  What if it breaks down and you're 1,500 feet under the water?  You're doomed.  I don't know.  I would assume they got some kind of plan.  Maybe something else on the boat that could come and tow you back.  I don't know.  Like a mini sub or something you're talking about?  Dude, like you know those things that take you down and then you're fucking, all of a 
[00:46:00]  sudden you're fucking 800 feet down or 2,000 feet down.  Well, you, you're not in the water though.  You're kind of in a, in a container.  Yeah.  You're talking about that?  What if it breaks down?  What if it runs out of gas or something?  Oh yeah, well that would suck.  You're fucking doomed.  Don't they have some kind of ballast thing where you can just blow the ballast tanks and  it takes you to the top?  Oh, maybe they do.  Yeah, but yeah, those vehicles or whatever they're called, undersea vehicles.  Like the mini, yeah, yeah.  Those don't have a tether.  Mini subs.  But how do you get back up if you break down?  You got to hope like a fucking plane, it doesn't go down. 
[00:46:30]  I bet there's an emergency thing though that you, you, you hit it and it blows out the  water out of the ballast tanks and you go right to the top.  But won't you get the bends doing that?  They probably haven't figured out where you're going.  It's pressurized, yeah, inside so they could probably slowly let the pressure out if you're  in there.  Yeah, we're out of our, we're so out of our league.  Yeah, I don't, I don't know.  I don't know.  Okay, I don't know.  I don't know.  That's interesting to me because that would scare me to go down, but if there was a contingency  plan, how far down is the Titanic?  Is that like 2,000 feet? 
[00:47:00]  God, Jimmy, you got a lot of questions.  It's like a mile.  I don't know why I'm asking you guys fucking ocean questions.  4,000.  I think that's right.  I think it's pushing a mile.  Yeah.  That would be coolest.  I would be, I'm not going to lie to anyone.  I'd be scared out of my mind, but I would have to do that.  Imagine they say you could go see the Titanic tomorrow.  I would go.  They're not doing it.  People can't go down there, right?  They have those mini subs that people go down there.  You can't go down there just and scuba dive.  Well, first of all, it's really hard to get to, right? 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It's in the middle of the Atlantic.  North Atlantic.  North Atlantic.  So it's a pain he has to get out to the site to begin with, and then you're going down  in one of these things, 4,000 feet easy.  I wonder how long that takes to get to the bottom and how long it takes to get back up.  I don't know any of this shit.  That would be a fucking...  It's not a quick trip.  No.  That would be an amazing...  And you're not there for a long time either.  No, you can't.  I think you can only stay down there for a while.  A few minutes or something like that, right?  Yeah, I don't know.  Oh, people call it.  We don't know. 
[00:48:00]  We don't know.  And they'll all have different fucking answers.  I know.  Hello?  No, I didn't go to one.  Hello?  Oh.  Because we can figure this shit out ourselves.  Sure, we can.  Sure, we can.  Yeah, I would do that in a second, but I would be...  Yeah?  I'd be scared.  I'd be scared we'd get stuck on the ship.  Like, it'd be fucking going by a railing and you'd hear, like, clink, clang.  Would you dive through caves?  No.  Why, man?  Because my luck, I'm claustrophobic.  I don't want to get stuck in a cave.  Oh, man.  Imagine that.  But you would never go diving in general, then? 
[00:48:30]  No, I would.  I like the water.  I'm a good swimmer.  It's kind of claustrophobic when you're in all your diving gear and realizing that this  little thing that's in your mouth is the only thing keeping you alive.  That's fucked up.  I have problems throwing a deep breath when I panic.  You have to just not panic, right?  Just relax.  Yeah, but when you figure it out and you start chilling and breathing right, there's nothing  better than diving.  It'd be like fucking Matt Hooper everywhere.  What stops the water going up your fucking nose?  Mask.  Mask.  Your body just knows not to do that. 
[00:49:00]  But is your nose open down there?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  No.  Yeah.  Is your nose open?  It's in the mask, though.  It's in the mask.  Yeah.  Your body's not going to...  Oh, fuck that.  I can't breathe.  Jimmy's like, I can't breathe.  Not even if my ass is wearing off.  Your body knows not to just fucking breathe water in.  Even I think when you're drowning, I don't think you do it.  No.  It's got to be...  Maybe you do.  Maybe that's what drowning is.  Maybe that's what gets you in the end.  You go, fuck it.  I got to hope that maybe somehow this is oxygen. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Hopefully, maybe my lungs can take the oxygen out of the water.  I'll be the first one that could...  Fish are looking at you like, what's the problem?  Yeah.  Would you dive in?  Uh, it's pretty scary.  Even when I snorkel, it gets creepy.  Yeah.  Like, just...  And I don't just stay on the surface.  Like, I do go down and swim down there.  You're almost there.  But it's...  It does get a little frightening.  Because most people just stay on the top, but you're like...  You're like going down a little bit.  And I do that thing and then come up and... 
[00:50:00]  Dude, diving is like...  I haven't done it in a couple years now, but fuck.  I love it.  Yeah.  And I got to get certified so I don't have to keep doing these pool resort courses.  Over and over again.  In the pool.  Dude, I've done it.  I've done the course eight times probably.  That's crazy.  Dumb.  Let's get certified.  And then I come back to New York.  Yeah, I'll find a pool and finally get certified.  And I never do.  Yeah.  Stupid.  They have weight belts.  No, I know that.  For regular diving.  Yeah. 
[00:50:30]  To keep you down.  Yeah, but if you put a little too much air in your fucking vest, you'll start coming up too fast.  15,000 feet?  Titanic is two and a half miles underwater.  Two and a half miles.  That's what's that?  You're way off.  Wow.  12,000.  12,000.  12,500.  Holy fuck.  Now I got to think about this again.  Like the people cared after the first mile.  Wow.  Like, ah, well, another mile and a half to go.  I don't know if Jimmy realizes this, and maybe you do, and I apologize.  It's completely...  Oh, black.  ...as dark as dark gets down there. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, pitch black.  So the only way you see the Titanic is the little fucking headlights you got and your  little fucking submersible.  Pitch black down there.  You can't go down there without a sub.  You'd get squished.  No, plus what would you eat?  Yeah, exactly.  But all of a sudden, they turn...  Imagine the lights go off in your little thingy.  You need to grab one of those fish with the headlights on their fucking...  The little lights on their head that are down there.  Those amazing light fish. 
[00:51:30]  Their stupid antenna eyes that are five feet from their bodies.  What the fuck?  Dude, there are things that live on the ocean floor.  They live there.  They just hang out.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  How boring.  And it's dark as night.  No, it's darker than night.  Pitch black, dude.  It's ultimate dark.  No sun gets down there.  I was watching stars every night.  I think I might start smoking pot because I have all the signs.  I'm just hanging out looking at the stars.  Yeah.  You don't get to see stars in New York City.  It's nice.  I'm like, wow, there's a lot of stars out there. 
[00:52:00]  God, let's go diving, man.  I don't know about that.  I don't know.  Maybe I would.  I don't go on vacation.  But a resort course, you only go...  I don't know.  They only take you like 40 feet down in most cases.  I want to go to fucking Dubai.  40 to 60, maybe.  I don't know if I'm going to go diving in Dubai, but that's kind of like where I want to go next.  Start with snorkeling, Jimmy.  I would snorkele.  Even snorkeling is cool.  I don't like breathing.  I want to have my whole head in the fucking thing.  It's like a space suit outfit, like I still could breathe in the ash and then a guillotine. 
[00:52:30]  Why would I want to put my head in a guillotine when I'm going diving?  That wouldn't be fun for anyone except for all those watching.  Yeah, snorkeling is fun.  I like that.  We're learning that I have some basic knowledge about submarines.  They wouldn't blow up if you go up too fast.  Really? 
[00:53:00]  All right.  For some reason, a sub wouldn't scare me as much because I guess they do sink, but there's so many guys on that ship, and it's built to fucking do that.  A small one would be claustrophobic.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  A sub might suck, though.  How far down do the subs go?  Oh, God.  Do they go far?  Yeah.  You know what's funny?  Nowadays.  I don't feel like going on, but Vinny says, Jimmy is asking questions like my wife asks questions.  We love Jimmy's innocent little questions. 
[00:53:30]  Well, this is that whole bit you do.  Wow.  Wow.  Where did the sun go?  Wow.  I go on a submarine.  If they go down too far, though, they crush.  They do, right?  Yeah, yeah.  If they just start sinking, you better hope you land on a fucking shelf.  Yeah, they just, and it's so fast.  They just, boom!  Is it fast, really?  Yeah, yeah.  They say that when that happens to people, it just, when it implodes, when the pressure  gets too much on the sub, and it finally does just give way, it's like in an instant. 
[00:54:00]  It just fucking collapses.  Has that happened?  Oh, yeah.  Russians have had a couple of those fucking deals happen.  Yeah.  But you probably just flatten out, and there are probably areas on the sub, like anything  else, like if you step on a soda can, picture a little man in a soda can.  There's still areas of the soda can.  I love Jimmy.  But there are-  Wow!  Wow!  Oh, man, in a soda can.  Oh, man, in a soda can.  But there are areas of the soda can.  How little is the little man in the soda can? 
[00:54:30]  I just need to know.  Small enough, like if the soda can were a sub, and there was a, I should say a little community  in the soda can.  Yes.  Wow.  And there's still little areas of the can that are buckled up.  So literally, when that thing collapses, there's probably someone that's just getting their  legs and chest crushed.  There's no way you live in that even for a second.  No.  No.  The pressure is so crazy.  If it crushed the sub enough to let water into the sub, you're gone.  See, it's not even that impressive. 
[00:55:00]  U.S. Navy submarines can submerge deeper than 800 feet.  The actual depth is classified, but it's less than the deep-diving U.S. Navy-supported  civilian-researched submarines that explore the bottoms of the ocean.  Subs cannot go down that far.  They're not made for that.  They're made for killing fucking ships.  Yeah, they're like, no ships.  How far down do you think, like, how far down does the ocean go in certain places?  The Marianas Trench goes deeper than the, uh, than the, uh, Mount Everest is high. 
[00:55:30]  That's 29,000 feet.  Does it really?  Yeah.  The Marianas Trench?  Yeah.  Show me a picture of that.  It's crazy.  Can you go down there?  Um, there have been people that have gone down in those, um, like, subs, uh, to the more  shallower region of it, but...  That's five miles.  That's over five miles.  It's crazy, yeah.  That's an airline altitude.  Crazy.  I've heard speculation about UFOs.  Like, can you imagine...  Because for us, water stops speed.  But if a UFO can travel through fucking space and through all those conditions, water could 
[00:56:00]  literally just be like another fucking...  There are...  Technology, if you're traveling with, like, a magnetic field around you, you could probably  blow through water with no difference than air.  Water would be just another fluid.  Yes, just like hydrogen and oxygen molecules.  It demoleculizes everything.  Demoleculizes.  And with no molecules, it flies through just like it is in the clouds, except there are  fishes looking at it.  In the middle gingerbread people.  Dr. Cuckoo...  I love you! 
[00:56:30]  I love you!  I love scared Dr. Cuckoo.  I'm just your neighbor.  You know what?  Once again, I gotta start smoking pot, because I was trying to figure out water on vacation,  too.  What do you mean?  When you...  Wow.  Do you ever try to, like, step out of your...  Out of your...  How do I explain this?  Your existence and just...  You look at water every day and go, ah, water.  You don't really think about it.  But if you try to go for that deep thinking on something...  On what it is and like...  You're like, water's pretty fucked up if you really start...  We're looking at it like, it doesn't make sense. 
[00:57:00]  That is some shit that you need to read for.  All of a sudden you jump in a pool, it's like, why are you wet?  Think about it.  Why are you wet?  Because the water's on you.  Yeah.  But then all of a sudden it dries, and then the water's gone.  Like, it's fucking weird.  Evaporation is a cooling process.  This is like pot talk shit, but if you go...  If you really, like...  All right, you think about water for maybe a minute, but no.  Now think about it for two minutes and five minutes.  Try to think about water for ten minutes.  It'll fucking freak you out.  Yeah.  What is it? 
[00:57:30]  It doesn't make sense with the rest of the shit that we live with.  Yeah.  And it's 75% of the planet.  You know what I mean?  And then I was trying to figure out fire, too.  Fire?  And then all of a sudden there's just this thing, fire, that could just fucking destroy shit.  You really were fucking chilling, weren't you?  I was trying to go deep with some stuff.  Damn.  Like, water.  Like, it hangs out in a pool, but, like, if you just drain the pool, it just has no shape  or nothing to it. 
[00:58:00]  Seeks its own level.  And then all...  Yeah, but then it'll kind of just disappear on you.  Yeah.  It's weird.  Mm.  And then I was walking the fucking beach, and I'm watching the waves, and I'm going,  yeah, pretty much that...  These waves have been happening for, I don't know, a good million years.  Exactly the same fucking way.  Yeah, it looked exactly the same at the beach.  Yeah.  When there was absolutely nothing on that island.  Nothing.  But those waves were just doing the same shit they were doing while I was there.  Yeah.  And they will continue to do the same shit after I'm long gone. 
[00:58:30]  It's the moon.  Pulling the fucking...  Yeah, yeah, I know.  The moon.  You know, I watched some show on how the Earth was formulated or something.  They said billions of years for this and billions of years...  And then they said it rained for a million years.  Like, that's how the fucking oceans are, what they are.  It was from rain.  I forget what it was that kicked up.  Ah, can't go out today.  Oh, I know.  Imagine opening an umbrella stand back then.  The guy's...  Who's that rich guy?  Oh, that's fucking...  That's Frank Umbrella.  He invented it.  Frank Umbrella. 
[00:59:00]  No matter what anyone invents, according to Jimmy, their last name was that.  For 400,000 years, everybody got wet until one man went,  Hey, look, what the fuck?  Put this thing over your head.  They're like, we didn't think of that, Frank.  Mr. Umbrella.  What about you're the umbrella man?  You have no umbrellas to sell to anyone because there's no other people yet.  Yeah.  You just happen to be the one guy alive with all these umbrellas because you came up with  this great idea.  Yeah, but you build it, and then the protoplasm comes over to you.  You don't want to talk to a bunch of fucking protoplasm.  But it rained.  I think it rained for a million years or however long it was. 
[00:59:30]  I forget what got kicked into the atmosphere that caused it.  Yeah.  But that's how the oceans are formed.  So.  And that goop that made up the planet.  I had a lot of time to myself because I was really trying to figure out water.  Water don't make sense.  Well, it's the two gases mixed.  And I'm now being called dumb, but I'm telling you, water just doesn't make sense.  Think about it.  It's a unique little thing.  Why is it always crystal clear?  Is it?  In most cases, yeah.  What's made up of gases? 
[01:00:00]  There are water.  You can see right through us.  What's in there?  Yeah.  It's a fucking hot water bottle.  If you look at that water bottle, it's invisible.  Well.  Yeah.  It is.  It just doesn't have any color.  But you throw it up in the air.  It's gone.  It's not a solid.  It's a liquid.  I know.  It's not literally gone.  It looks like it's gone to you, but it has gone somewhere.  Now, see, you're just thinking about it on the surface. 
[01:00:30]  Have you thought about gases yet?  No, not yet.  I'll get there.  No, you're just thinking about water on the surface.  I'm telling you.  Spend 10 minutes on it.  What happens when water gets...  Just keep thinking about it.  What happens when water gets really cold?  That's weird, too.  All of a sudden, that shit is solid.  What the fuck?  Because the molecules slow down.  What?  What?  Because the molecules slow down.  In water, they're like, whoa.  They're all fast.  And gas, they're like, wah.  And then in water and liquid, they're kind of like, whoa.  And then in solid, they're like, brr.  Is ice moving, but just really slow? 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  Ice is the same thing.  It's the same molecules, hydrogen and oxygen molecules, but they move so slow that it turns  into a solid.  So basically, in a frozen world, if you said to your ice cube, hey, come here, boy.  Eventually, it'll show up.  But start wrapping your head around what you just said.  That turns into ice.  That's fucked up.  Yeah.  And it's explaining it on a science level, but just fucking wrap your head around that  for a while to freak out.  Because right now, if you just drop that on the carpet, it'll just get absorbed into the 
[01:01:30]  carpet.  And then eventually disappear.  But if it's cold enough and you drop it on the carpet, you can pick it back up.  Right.  Thank you.  I get it.  And then if you heat it up enough and the molecules really get moving, it just goes into  the air.  And then why does it start boiling?  Yeah.  That's fucking weird, too.  That's all them molecules going, whoa, and really going fast.  So why do they go faster when you heat them up?  Because that's how molecules work.  You heat them up, they move faster.  You can't just say that's how it works.  Mm-mm.  Why?  Friction. 
[01:02:00]  Why?  Because they're moving fast.  And they're fucking rubbing on each other.  Why doesn't the water decide to start boiling right now?  Because it has a boiling temperature.  Why?  Other liquids have, like liquid nitrogen boils at room temperature.  Why?  Because of the molecular makeup.  Kenny will help out.  It's different.  I got a good observation.  Yeah.  The water talks on coming train life.  If you drink water, then you can piss it out of your prick. 
[01:02:30]  And that ends that discussion.  Ah, well.  By the way, when I was in Orlando, we were in the fucking pharmacy and I was looking for  something and Kenny goes, excuse me, doctor.  To the pharmacist?  Yeah.  And then I needed something else.  Oh, that's classic.  And he goes over and he goes, excuse me, medic?  He calls him a medic.  Kenny's great.  He calls security guards, officer.  Officer. 
[01:03:00]  Yes, officer.  Or man, anyone with a uniform gets called officer.  So calling the pharmacist doctor is in the same vein.  That's hilarious.  Medic was my favorite.  It's like, how do you not laugh?  Medic.  That's really funny.  Shit.  All right.  You guys want to eat?  Yeah.  And that's fucking...  The Joseph Coney guy got arrested.  Yeah.  Oh, that's classic.  I want to talk...  We should talk about that now.  Yeah.  He didn't like the Joseph Coney song that's going around online.  Oh, really?  Yes.  He did not like it. 
[01:03:30]  Oh.  What's that?  You've heard it.  How does it go?  It's only three lines.  Yeah.  I haven't heard it.  Joseph Coney eats pepperoni, and he's full of bologna.  Oh, boy.  Joseph Coney eats pepperoni, and he's full of bologna.  That'll make him famous.  That's worse than my water observation.  Thank God you saved me.  Wow.  You saved me.  So I'm back to reality and realize... 
[01:04:00]  Shut up about the water.  I heard that on the computer, and it's in my head for...  It's actually on the computer.  That's not a Jimmy original?  I don't know.  Of course it is.  It's gotta be.  He goes, I don't know.  And Santorum.  Holy fuck, man.  Oh, not for him.  We've got to talk about Santorum.  Not for him.  He really is a twat.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, we'll get into that.  And other things, I guess, right?  Andy Pettit, really?  He's coming out of retirement?  What's he doing?  Oh, it's great.  Well, Andy Pettit knew! 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  What is he doing?  Yeah.  He's fucking 39?  Is he 40?  But didn't he have just an okay year last year?  Yeah.  Everyone's excited.  Well, they'll like him.  Yeah.  He's a nice guy, right?  Nice guy.  Let's bring back Posada, too.  Can we do that?  That's right.  Just bring them all back.  Bring them all back.  Who's still playing from that era?  I mean, Jeter's the only one.  Obviously.  I mean, Gerardi's the coach.  Fucking O'Neal's gone.  Jeter and Mariano.  Rivera's still there.  It was probably Rivera's last year.  That's pretty much it, right?  Mattingly left before the big fucking... 
[01:05:00]  Before all the championships.  Remember Luis Polonia?  Luis Polonia.  All these little utility players.  Who is the guy, the shortstop third baseman?  Mariano Duncan would play.  Was he an outfielder or a shortstop?  A utility infielder.  I don't know any of this right now.  I think he was a utility player.  Scott Brocious.  Oh, my God.  Charlie...  Brocious.  Chuck Knobloch.  Knobloch, who was brought in from the Twitter.  Who was Charlie...  Who caught the final out of the 96 World Series?  Charlie Hayes?  Fuck, man. 
[01:05:30]  Who was that center fielder?  Let's go back.  Oh, Bernie Williams.  Jesus.  Bernie.  You know all your mid-level Yankees from the 90s.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah, man.  By the way, because we're going to move on from this, James Cameron is making a movie seven  miles down.  Yeah.  Really?  What's it about?  Probably all the shit down there.  It's just an hour and a half of pitch black with the sound...  But it's brilliant.  And it's in 3D.  Yeah.  And you just have voices, but then...  I stepped on a fish. 
[01:06:00]  Where's the lights?  I stepped on a fish.  How great would that be?  How long would it take for people to get so mad?  Start walking out of the theater.  Start walking out.  What the fuck is this?  It's like an Andy Kaufman.  Kaufman used to do shit like that.  But he really went down there to film it in pitch black.  Right, right.  What a waste.  Kaufman used to what?  Read books and stuff?  And people would go, oh, that's funny and different.  But then he would just continue reading until there's absolutely no one left in the club.  Is he going to the trench? 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  Is that where James Cameron's going?  That's what's coming in.  And now they're saying seven miles.  Yeah, seven miles down.  It goes down seven miles.  It's crazy.  Holy fuck.  That's fucking crazy.  Is it a movie or is it like a documentary?  I don't know.  I'd love to see that.  I would assume it's some kind of documentary.  Isn't he there already?  Isn't he doing it?  He's down there already.  He's right now.  He's having coffee right now somewhere.  Seven miles underwater.  More people have been to the moon than to where he's going.  Well.  Wait. 
[01:07:00]  Has anybody been there?  Yes.  Yeah.  To the bottom of it?  That's what they say.  How far down have people gone?  There's the deep part where I don't think anybody's been.  Like the trench goes from not shallow but not as deep as it can get.  And then it like tapers off and goes really fucking deep.  That's the tectonic plates, I think.  Only two people have been there.  Only two people have been to how far down?  What?  Have they touched the floor?  Yeah, they touched it.  They spent 20 minutes.  Picard.  Jean-Luc.  Yes. 
[01:07:30]  And some U.S. Navy captain.  They went how far down?  Only two people have been to this underwater valley.  The valley.  Have they been to the bottom of it or do they just kind of go to a shallower area?  Exactly.  Yeah, they probably haven't gone on it.  They spent only 20 minutes there.  Their sub picked up so much of the seafloor that all they could see out the window was a murky fog.  Yeah, that's the problem with those things.  The submarine kicks up the silt.  And then you're all the way down there and you're like, this is great.  And you can't see. 
[01:08:00]  I can't see.  God damn it.  So they didn't even get to see it.  No.  They have to get something that extends from the front of the sub with a camera, like a big Google eye that can go out beyond your fucking...  I love them.  But they got to get a fucking camera that can extend.  I think the murk and muck extends so far outside that to have a boom that would go out that far with the camera would still be.  That one was 50 years ago, so I'm sure they have like...  Wait, yeah, no.  50 years?  They haven't been back. 
[01:08:30]  It must suck down there.  They can hover high enough and then send the Google eye down.  Yeah.  The googly eye.  The googly eye.  But wait, that's a good point.  That kicks up all that silt and shit.  Yeah.  You got to be able to go down there and then like kind of hang for a while and let it all settle down.  Why don't you settle down?  Yeah.  Settle down every night on the tectonic plate floor, ma.  Settle down.  They actually discovered that back in the oldie days with wooden ships.  What's that?  There was some guy, he decided he was going to map the floor of the ocean. 
[01:09:00]  So it went out with rope and weights and the rope had like marks on it of how many like fucking meters or whatever the fuck measurement he was using.  Right.  And they would put it down when it hit the bottom.  And he'd go, okay, and then he'd fucking pull it up and see where it was and mark down like where he was.  How do you know where he was in the ocean?  I know, exactly.  In a wooden ship.  They kind of knew back then.  Don't give me that star shit.  They know.  They know.  It's amazing.  And then they did that and then he got over the trench.  Right.  And they just kept pouring rope out. 
[01:09:30]  What the fuck?  Dan, dan, dan, dan.  And they had to get more rope, more rope.  And they went to like seven miles of fucking rope.  They had seven miles of rope on the ship, on the wooden ship.  A lot of rope.  And they were able to map the whole ocean that way?  They said something's real deep over here.  How do they know that it wasn't going down anymore?  I guess they had a weight pulling it down.  Yeah, yeah.  How heavy was the weight?  A million pounds.  And how do you get the fucking rope back up?  Yo, pull it.  Whose job is that?  Some scallywag, I guess.  Popeyes.  Some scallywag.  Terrible job to have to pull up seven miles of rope. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, that's got to suck.  And then you fucking, someone's stretching, you drop it to the spot.  And four and a half pull back up.  You think your hands would hurt?  Oh, man, that's got to suck.  You need some hand cream.  Hopefully the captain has some hand cream.  What year did they finally map the whole ocean?  Oh, that was done.  What a ship guy didn't get the whole ocean done.  I'm sorry.  No, no, no.  There's no way.  They used that fucking side scanning sonar now.  No, I understand.  What year? 
[01:10:30]  What year finally?  I think they're still actually working on some areas.  So I don't think they have the entire ocean mapped yet.  So there might be another area that's pretty crazy, right?  A lot of unknown.  I like that show.  You see the show Drain the Oceans?  You can't drain the ocean.  Well, of course not, but they do it virtually from some of the Great Lakes and some of the Indian Ocean and other things.  And they show you what it looks like if they just drained the fucking ocean.  That would be cool.  And there's mountain ranges and valleys and, like, there's all kinds of shit going on down there. 
[01:11:00]  We got no clue of.  Should drain it.  They should drain it, shouldn't they?  Where would you put the water?  You put it in outer space and save it till later.  Or maybe you put it in a bunch of drinking glasses and everybody who's thirsty gets a little bit and can go for a dip.  Or you drain it and you send it around in space and then when you need it, you just make it rain again.  I love Nana answers.  The Nana answer.  You have to have the Nana voice and she doesn't know much of anything.  You just got to get a giant straw, whatever. 
[01:11:30]  A big giant glass of giant straw.  You pump from one to the other.  Nobody knows.  Just pump it out like they did when our basement flooded.  It's easy.  You just use a pump.  A giant sumpa.  Sumpa pumper.  We're off the rails, honestly.  But fuck it.  It's fine.  Oh, one other observation from vacation?  Vacation observation.  That was very blatant.  Hey, we're going to be taking your vacation observation.  Sounds like a bit.  Some of the natives down there look like Avatar people. 
[01:12:00]  They're blue?  All they needed was the blue.  But they're brown, right?  They look like Avatar people.  You mean the long faces?  Are they tall guys?  A little of all that.  Very tall.  Slender.  Legs.  Speedy.  Like kind of alien eyes.  Oh, really?  Very white.  Very white eyes.  Interesting.  They look like Avatar people.  All you have to do is paint them blue.  A blue?  Not Handel, that fuck.  It's Handel again. 
[01:12:30]  Who the fuck is Handel?  Let me see.  Handel.  Fucking Handel.  Running from paternity suits, I'm sure.  Do you think he bangs a lot of chicks?  Oh, did Handel fuck the world?  You haven't been here for the Handel discussions?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, good.  This fucking guy was hitting on Ed's wife, my girl at the time, and everyone else's.  I wish he was literally hitting on my wife.  It would have been great.  Yeah, he could have had my fucking chick too.  I don't give a fuck.  God, I would love to know how many he was knocking back in a week.  You think anybody's ever watched him bang their wife and jerk off? 
[01:13:00]  Oh, without a doubt.  A Club Med cuck just down there, watching his wife getting tooled by Handel.  Dude, it's the perfect job.  You got these women coming through Club Med week after week, and you know they have to leave.  Yeah, yeah.  So if you have no interest in having an actual girlfriend, holy fuck, you're knocking them back left and right, and you have no baggage.  They have to leave.  You think occasionally he gets a chick that's like, I think I want to stay here.  I'm sure. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  They're just guiding her into the fucking SUV to the airport.  It's all good.  Yeah, Handel, I think I want to stay here with you.  I think I'm falling in love.  It's all good.  Everybody to the van, man.  We got to get you all to the airport.  No, but Handel, you don't understand.  Have a hat.  Have a floppy hat.  Oh, and off she is, conga lining her fucking burdenous ass out of there. 
[01:14:00]  When you go through customs down there, they're like, how long are you going to be here?  You have to say seven days, and they're going to come find you if you've been there more than seven days.  So I'm sure he gives the rap like, oh, man, it's too bad.  I would love to have you stay here, but you have to go.  You'll be a fugitive.  Well, fugitive.  And then the girl probably goes to Handel, well, I'll be back.  I'll try to come back in four months.  And he's like, yeah, you know, can't wait to see you again.  Yeah, yeah, sure.  But within that four-month period, he's banged another hundred broads probably. 
[01:14:30]  That Handel with Barbara Bush.  Holy fuck.  I don't know who that is.  Some old lady trying to get Handel Dick.  Oh, yeah.  He's sending his fucking father to bag her.  Dude, this guy did it.  This guy did it with a smile the whole fucking time.  You're like, is he hitting on my chick?  You're not sure because there's a smile.  What does he do?  And he makes believe that he cares about you a little bit.  He fucks the women.  Yeah.  He's some kind of activity director.  He's like the guy that goes around and makes everyone have fun, you know. 
[01:15:00]  Hey, we're all going to do this.  We're drinking sangria shots on the beach and doing limbo.  And you're like, oh, here we go.  Okay, this guy.  He's going to fuck everybody.  I love doing this bit, so fuck it.  And you go down there with your pasty white.  Oh, yeah.  Because it's looking like shit.  Because it's the middle of winter where you're from.  And these guys are bronze goddess gods.  You're seeing exotic gentlemen.  And you're just a pasty white fucking scallop.  Right.  You work for a living.  Scallop.  And all they have to do is bang broads and go to the gym every day. 
[01:15:30]  How are you ever going to compete with that?  He's been down there since summer of 94.  Reception team.  Chief DeVillage.  He's been Chief DeVillage since fucking 90, 98.  Wait, where's he now?  Chief DeVillage.  Where is he now, Sam?  Itaparica.  Where's that?  Wow, he's still working?  Me and Ann met him back in 97, 98.  98, maybe?  Oh, Jesus.  That's 14 years ago.  Those island guys, though, man, they look the fuck...  It's hard to tell if they age. 
[01:16:00]  They just look young.  His dick must be rotting off.  Yeah, you know, he's banging off of those chicks.  Oh, yeah.  Is that what he looks like now?  He looks exactly the same.  Fuck this life we have.  You think he's gotten any blowjobs down there from tourists?  Holy fuck, dude.  This guy...  A couple, I think, perhaps.  Wow.  That's what he looks like, really?  Mm-hmm.  Fucking guy.  He's doing something.  Endul.  I bet you there's girls that have fucked him in, like, 98, and they go back in 2006.  Like, oh, he can't wait to see me, and they're all fat. 
[01:16:30]  And he's like, oh.  Yeah.  But all he has to say, I remember at the time, he used to say, it's all good.  It's all good.  So that gets you out of anything.  No matter what the problem was.  It's all good.  Endul, you are fucking my wife.  I'm going to kill you.  It's all good.  We're free love down here.  You could have mine, too, if I had one.  Yeah.  It's the perfect job, though.  These broads just come marching in, and then they march out a week later.  Yep.  And all you have to do is make believe you did care. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  Ah, it's too bad you've got to go back to fucking Cleveland or Boston or New York.  Goodbye.  Yeah.  Goodbye.  They even give you a party as you're getting back on the bus.  I know.  That was the best part.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  And you just, there you go.  All right, everybody.  Have a good flight.  Remember us down here.  Come see us again.  We're all family.  All the women are walking like fucking John Wayne after he's been on horseback.  They're just fucking scooting into the fucking sitting on hemorrhoid rings on the fucking van on the way to the airplane. 
[01:17:30]  They go through a lot of inner.  They go through a lot of inner tubes.  Oh, it's just take the inner tube with you.  Deep kicking all of them.  Complimentary Club Med fucking Preparation H for when he prolapsed.  Collapsed their asshole.  I'm barking today.  Is it hot in here?  No.  Your pit stink?  Oh, my God.  Look.  What the fuck?  Is yours? 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, I put it on, man.  Want to smell?  No.  Oh, Jesus.  E-Rock.  Good E-Rock.  That's brutal.  I could talk about Hendel for an hour.  I know.  And I could do the same lines.  You could do your lines.  It'll be like hearing it for the first time for me.  I think he had the best scam I've ever seen in my entire fucking life.  My fucking girl was, at the time, was so wet for this guy.  Oh, God.  And you had to just sit there. 
[01:18:30]  I had fucking baloney tits.  I wasn't working out as much as I do now.  I look like shit.  Pasty white.  Horrible, like, a swimsuit.  I pulled off the rack last minute to go down there.  You didn't have that V back then?  Oh, fuck no.  You must be doing something right now.  These guys had form-fitting fucking bathing suits on with the right colors.  And they just had it all figured out.  That's all they did.  And all they did was bang broads.  It's so obvious.  What else did they have to do? 
[01:19:00]  It's all good.  It's all good.  We should try to get Hendel on the phone.  Oh, my God.  He remembers us.  Sure.  It's been millions of people through there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, but we did a radio broadcast for them.  I'll bet there are people, like, there are listeners who go to a clubbed with their wife now.  And, like, Hendel introduces himself.  Yeah.  And they know him from this show and go, oh, no.  Not Hendel.  Oh, fuck. 
[01:19:30]  No.  He's the only one you remember.  And there were a whole bunch of Hendels.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But he was, like, the Mac Daddy of the Hendels.  He was the guy.  He was the Mac Daddy.  This fucking guy.  Jesus.  He knew how to fucking work it.  We had marine asshole on our boats.  Oh, that was the guy that, uh, the dive instructor who thought he was, uh, a Navy SEAL.  Snorkeling instructor.  Oh, right, was it?  It makes it worse, yeah.  But I think he was also the diving guy.  Yeah, but then they had to throw him on the snorkel boat with us idiots at the time. 
[01:20:00]  If you get into trouble, don't wave your arms around.  This guy is telling us not to touch the coral or any of the sea life and then to show off to the broads on the boat who are all with their men.  Yeah.  He would come up from the seafloor with all sorts of wildlife.  But nobody else is allowed.  No one else is allowed.  But he comes up.  He jumped.  He did a perfect dive off the boat with a knife in his mouth, you know?  Not a splash.  No.  When he hits the water.  It just went bloop.  And then he's down there for forever. 
[01:20:30]  So the girls are like, is he okay?  Is he okay?  And then, you know, the water breaks.  He comes up, throws his ample head of hair back, and then just, this is a starfish.  We're diving in.  I got him 40 feet down.  Yeah, you fucking cocksucker.  He pulled a sea turtle out of the water, which is the worst thing.  And he has a knife in his mouth just in case there's problems down there.  Yeah, he could take care of any problem.  But we're not allowed to fucking kick the coral with our stupid flippers. 
[01:21:00]  Nah, don't kick the coral.  Do you think he's embarrassed taking his shirt off in front of girls?  Oh, Jesus.  He loved it.  These guys never put their shirts on.  It would be in the middle of the night.  It'd be kind of cold, and we're all hanging around the pool, and they still have their shirts off.  He loved it.  And then the women on the boat are all like fucking, they got fucking love in their eyes with this idiot.  And I'm sure he, you know, he was able to separate a few from the herd.  Oh, yeah.  Got him from the herd.  He separated a few.  That's great. 
[01:21:30]  Fucking guys.  Yeah.  Someone told me a comic I used to know named Lenny was down there doing that.  Like doing like, he was a black comic.  He used to work Dangerfields a lot.  And he had one of those personalities where.  He does Club Med?  I don't know.  I heard he was doing like one of those where he was like kind of like an activity director or something.  And he'd probably be good at it.  And it was so black.  Yeah, he was dark.  He's like a black guy, but then just being in the sun all that time. 
[01:22:00]  I mean, the people he's with, he's with three white people, one girl, and then two guys who are maybe fours.  Do you think the girl is married to that guy except she fucked Hendel?  I think they're all, it looks like they all work for the same fucking place.  Yeah, I don't think she's married to either one of them.  But I bet you one of those guys is in love with that girl that all she thinks of is Hendel's fucking ocean floor smelling balls on her nose.  You know, with Facebook, some of our listeners should fucking send in the pictures they have with Hendel.  I guarantee you there's a million of them out there. 
[01:22:30]  Definitely.  Where he has his arm around fucking wives, girlfriends.  Oh, yeah.  You name it.  I want a montage of Hendel just doing the all good as he's holding your girl lovingly in front of your fucking eyes.  Yeah.  And there's nothing we could do.  I think he was like six fucking four.  Oh, yeah.  Not only that.  Yeah.  If you challenged him, he'd kick your ass.  You could tell he's fucking really cool.  It's all good that I'm beating you and fucking your girl.  It's all good?  Really?  Why is that?  Because of the music. 
[01:23:00]  Ding, ding, ding.  Yeah, man.  It's okay.  Remember.  Yeah, it's all good.  How could you be angry if this is playing?  Oh, hands up.  What is this?  Hands up?  Club Med team.  Yeah.  This song sucks.  This song sucks.  Hands up, baby, hands up.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  So you have to have a certain personality to be able to get people motivated to be entertained. 
[01:23:30]  Like, you could never do that.  You know, the story of the guy, like, getting a blowjob coming back from the beach party while a storm was coming in.  These guys.  He was no looker.  He was like Popeye.  That guy was maybe a four and he was getting pussy.  Can you imagine what handle it was getting?  I want to know what it's like just to take your shirt off in front of people and be okay with it.  That's all I want with my Weight Watchers points.  Are you still on there?  Yes. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah?  Doing good?  Yeah.  Kenny, is he doing good?  Yes, sir.  All right.  Hey, remember Lydia from Oceanside?  True.  I know we're trying to break, but she gave her handle syphilis when she went up.  Holy shit.  Lydia, is this true or are you just fucking trying to get on the radio today?  Absolutely true.  I would not lie to you, boy.  It's not the handle we're talking about.  You're now just basically saying handle because you know the guy we're talking about.  It's that guy.  It's that guy.  They're at every one of these club med type places looking to pick off your woman. 
[01:24:30]  I even remember my handle's name because I had to write him a letter saying I gave him syphilis.  Don't you think by the time the letter got there, he knew?  Yeah, right.  I was 16.  I didn't know I had syphilis.  You were 16?  Yes.  And you're banging.  How old was he?  Ramon Philippe, and I'll leave out his last name.  Ramon Philippe was probably in his late 20s. 
[01:25:00]  Okay.  Late 20s, banging back his 16-year-old with syphilis.  Did he wear a condom?  Of course not.  Condom, shmandom in those days.  Was he black or Spanish?  He was a mix of black and Spanish in Aruba.  Did he have a big penis?  He was a civilian director.  Did he have a big penis?  Yeah.  Did he have a penis?  Did he see how her voice changed?  Like it was yesterday.  Yeah.  Did your husband make you tell that story while you're having sex? 
[01:25:30]  No, my husband doesn't know this story.  I hope he's not listening.  Make sure he knows now.  Wow.  So you went down there with some girls?  Some girlfriends?  I went there with my family, and my mom pimped me out to the voting director.  Oh, God.  Holy shit.  She didn't care that, you know.  She sent me off to spend the night with him.  No.  To live with either.  Wow.  That's fucked up right there.  Well, my message is don't feel too bad, because Kendall must have gotten a couple of cases 
[01:26:00]  of the clap over the years.  Oh, no, wait a minute.  Your mother sent you to spend the night with the guy from the...  But why?  I was raised by wolves, Jimmy.  Did she do you were going to fuck the guy?  Yes.  Now, why did she want to get rid of you for the night?  Was she having sex with someone she didn't want you to know about?  Yeah.  No, I think she was more living, vicariously groomed.  Wow.  Now we know why you're a psychiatrist. 
[01:26:30]  Yes.  You're fucked up.  You know shit.  Lydia's a dirty girl.  Yeah, Lydia is a dirty girl.  Lydia's a big-titted, sexy, dirty lady.  Dirty.  She's an animal.  She's naughty.  You think she's an animal?  If you're banging foreign black guys at 16, what age were you when you lost it?  15.  Oh, yeah?  I had a pretty sharp learning curve.  You got right into it, did you?  She's like, I just lost my virginity, but I want a real fucking... 
[01:27:00]  But here I am in Aruba with the gorgeous voting director that my mom is pushing me at.  Damn, man.  You are just fucking...  And I thought the white spots on my hand were from the sun.  White spots on your hand?  What's that about?  That's how I figured out I had syphilis.  I got back from Aruba and the white spots on my hands and the soles of my feet, my palms and the soles of my feet wouldn't go away. 
[01:27:30]  What the fuck?  Jesus.  You sure it was just syphilis?  It was actually, unfortunately, rather advanced.  I wish I had it for a while, you animal.  You had advanced syphilis where it was coming out your feet?  And you came into this guy fucking Ramon Philippe.  Oh, man.  Philippe or Philippe A?  Ramon Philippe. 
[01:28:00]  Philippe, Jesus.  And then he had another last name, and I had to write him a letter because he was engaged.  Did he ever write you back?  He was away that week.  Dear Philippe, if you notice white pustules on the bottom of your feet...  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Was it really itchy?  No, not at all.  Did you have a discharge?  Not at all.  It was just white spots.  Oh, you mean itchy?  Was my vagina itchy?  Yeah. 
[01:28:30]  How'd you know you had it?  She had it for four to six weeks.  Ugh, what a whore.  Without realizing it.  That's 16.  What are the fucking white spots?  I'm not asking you, I'm asking Dr. Sam.  The secondary stage can include hair loss, a sore throat, white patches in the nose, mouth,  and vagina, fever, headaches, and a skin rash.  I'm assuming the white spots in the skin rash.  Wait a minute, what else?  I'm just kidding.  Is syphilis still around?  Is that a dumb question? 
[01:29:00]  Oh, yeah.  It probably is, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, gotta love that one.  Lydia, you still do the ass sex, or what?  You still an animal?  You know, I agree with you guys.  Ass sex was really young.  Yeah, I think so, too, man.  Yeah, you can pull something out now.  I mean, if my husband really wanted it, I'd give it up, but...  Women your age, gravity's pulling your asshole out.  You don't need fucking a big plunger-like cock to do it.  I don't need any help.  That was a rhetorical statement. 
[01:29:30]  Some people are saying you're the idiot that Ramon gave you the syphilis.  Well, I wish that were true, but it turns out I left the wake of people with syphilis.  So, I don't know what happened.  Typhoid Mary fucking Jesus.  So, who gave you the syphilis?  Do you have an idea?  I know exactly who gave me syphilis.  I confronted him with it.  Don't say his name, but how'd you know him?  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:30:00]  Give us some details about his name.  The guy who lives where I was growing up, and when I went to confront him with it,  I found him in bed with his gay partner.  Oh, jeez.  So?  That doesn't mean he had syphilis.  Well, he did admit it.  Oh, he did.  I just thought that was an interesting part of the story.  Oh, did he admit it?  That he was gay, and I didn't know it.  God, you're an animal.  Lydia's an animal.  She really is.  I have a clueless dummy. 
[01:30:30]  You were young, and just kind of getting out there a little bit.  How'd you have it on?  Why does it come out in your hands and the bottom of your feet?  Yeah.  Were you giving a foot job?  Were you doing that wacky foot job thing?  Uh-huh.  You'd grab on with the soles of your feet and...  At first, they thought it was our detergent.  They made us switch detergent.  Maybe you should have used some in your vagina. 
[01:31:00]  Disgusting.  But she knows what we're talking about, man.  These guys are fucking, as they like to say on the Jersey Shore, DTF.  Yes.  Get ready to go, these guys.  And they'll take your wife right in front of your eyes.  They don't give a fuck.  Yeah.  There's one or two at every resort for sure.  That's their job.  They've helped the women.  All right, Lydia.  This is too much sexiness for one day.  Too much sexiness.  Oh, God.  All right. 
[01:31:30]  That syphilis-ridden vagina of yours.  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks, Lydia.  Cigars and scotch really fast.  Hey, it's good.  Yeah, I'm going down to the Bahamas this week,  and I made a point to casually bring up the eight statistics of the islands  and why Nassau isn't very populated.  So, one in 33.  Yeah, watch out for these guys.  They're out there.  Yeah, they would just want to have sex with your girls.  And a lot of the women are weak when they see them.  Oh, yeah.  They need it. 
[01:32:00]  All right.  Just hit that.  We'll do something next.  I don't know if we can fucking hit it.  The Opinion Trichel.  Oh, yeah.  On Sirius XM.  Coming up on the next episode of The Spectacular Suicide,  the notorious villain Angerman is hurling helpless children  from the windows of the Lil' Leopard's Orphanage to the streets below.  Who can stop this deranged, diabolical, demented mastermind? 
[01:32:30]  No one, nobody can stop me.  I'm invincible.  Come here, little Timmy.  Would you like to see?  Would you like to see if you can fly?  Come on, stupid door. 
[01:33:00]  I'm kicking you.  Now, open.  Oh, wait.  Doorknob.  Stop it right there, Angerman.  Suicide.  That's right.  Hey, right where you are.  Don't come any closer.  Or I'll throw another hopeless child to the streets below. 
[01:33:30]  This ends right now, Angerman.  Leave those children alone or out.  Or you'll...  What?  What?  Um, what?  What?  Okay, okay, bye.  That's what I thought.  Up, up and away!  Oh, crap.  I forgot.  I can't fly.  Out!  My leg! 
[01:34:00]  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  By us...  By us...  Us...  Us...  Us...  Us...  Us...  Turn...  Statement.  I'm unstoppable.

[01:40:00]  This world is awfully big  I sure miss this  Okay then  There you go  I don't hate E-Rock today man  Look at, he fucking did the job today  E-Rock  We have to bring it up on the air right  Yeah  So uh  We ripped down the  What was this  A logo thing  Across the fucking windows 
[01:40:30]  Yeah it's a signage  It's a little  O.B. and Anthony channel decal  That went around the whole  Perimeter of the  Glass room that we're in  And it was  High enough  And low enough  Exactly in position  For us to not be able to see  Anything going on in the hallways  Right  So E-Rock was the one  That ripped it down  I said E-Rock  We have to rip this down immediately  It's stupid  We want logos on the windows  So when we film our videos  And take our pictures  Yeah the logo's in there  Because some of this shit goes viral  And you want to make sure  We get a little credit 
[01:41:00]  And the company likes that  Blah blah blah  Sure  But this big black logo  Was dumb  We had like these see-through decals  That we want  Right  Yeah  So E-Rock  Ripped down their hard work  And during the break  Gary walked in  And was just making believe  He didn't notice  Like hey guys  How you doing  And I'm telling him  It's hanging from the fucking windows  Yeah we didn't just throw it away  It's crumbled up  And just stuck back on the window 
[01:41:30]  Jimmy tweeted a picture right  Yeah  You can't miss it  I tweeted  No I took the picture  Oh you didn't tweet it  It's horrible  And he came in like  Hey guys  Hope how was your vacation  Making believe  I'm not bothered by this  Or I don't even notice it  He probably expected it  You don't think he noticed  If he didn't seem like he noticed  He probably didn't notice right  Yeah I guess  How could you not notice  Oh is that  Mary Tyler Moore  Final episode 35 years ago  Before your time  Children of the 80s  1977  No  Shows off  What  Wow I was 
[01:42:00]  I was  Yeah I was  I wasn't  Yeah  Yeah this was before our time  Oh well before right  Being children of the 80s and all  Yeah  What was that  Was that the final episode  Where they all were in like  A big fucking group hug  Going to the Kleenex  Yes and then they had to  Shut the light out  And say goodnight  And that was it  But weren't they crying  But they had to get to the tissues  Yes yes  And they were all hugging  And that was the last  Like kind of laugh there  Do you remember this Jimmy  I certainly do  It was very sad  It was an amazing show  I loved Mary Tyler Moore  Not her 
[01:42:30]  I loved the show though  Her on the show  Great  She was alright  Ed Asner was amazing  And fucking  Betty White  And fucking  Cloris Leachman  And Ted Knight  What a cast  Yeah  Ted Baxter  He was  Great  He was  He killed it  Oh yeah  And then you had Steuben  Murray Slaughter  You had Captain Steuben  See they're all shuffling  To the Kleenex  Because they're all sad  God  Betty White  Looked old then  I know right  What year 
[01:43:00]  That's 77  That went off the air  Yeah  So that's 20  23  35 years ago  So Betty White  Was 55 already  Wow  Hi  Okay Mary  Well I just wanted you to know  That sometimes I get concerned  About being a career woman  I get to thinking my job  Is too important to me  And I tell myself  She's going for an Emmy here 
[01:43:30]  That the people I work with  Are just the people I work with  And not my family  Didn't Ted keep his job  Last night I thought  Yeah  I think so  He's the only one  That kept the job  What is a bad movie anyway  Oh god this horseshit  This show sucked  Did it get silly or what  I don't know  It takes  It's too long  And I  I really loved  Yeah  And that's what you've done for me  And now Lou Grant  Punches her in the face  Thank you for being my fat queen  It's going to be Ted Knight right 
[01:44:00]  Yeah  Ted's got to say  Come on Ted  No for the hard part  How do we leave this room  That's not so hard  Remember what Ted said  What is that Lou  What is that Lou 
[01:44:30]  That night's fucking great  That's not even a funny line  It's not a funny line  It's just how he says  What is that Lou  What is that Lou  Even in that sad moment  He's so desperate  To get his compliment  Yeah  Yeah  He was a funny best  Desperate for his compliment  He was fucking hilarious  It's not too hard  Remember what Ted said 
[01:45:00]  What is that Lou  What is that Lou  It's not even supposed to be funny  That's hilarious  I guess it was supposed to be funny  Yeah of course  Yeah  But by the way  Here's why I want to smash A-Rock  Why  Just  Sam  Why  Please  Please go back to where you were  And just play  And this is how it should have come back  Oh  Thank you  Oh  Well  I didn't look at the 
[01:45:30]  Why  What's going on with this  Where are we with this  I don't see anything on the sheet  About Ozzy or Black Sabbath  Or  I don't know  I see it's going close to 65  I  I don't see that fucking thing  Oh  Oh  Is this uh 
[01:46:00]  Oh I know  What do you know  Is it  Is this  You want to play this for Russell  For the Coney guy  Because he's crazy  Why are we playing this  30 years ago today  How many  30 years ago  This song came out  No  That would be more 
[01:46:30]  It's 82 or 30 years ago  I don't know  Blizzard of Oz  No  Back in 82  Ozzy left Sabbath  No that was 79  Oh  Is it on our sheet somewhere  No  Why would it be  March 19th  1982  He bit the head off a bat  No  Pissed on the Alamo 
[01:47:00]  No  He bit the dove  No the dove and the bat  Were not that far apart  Oh  Uh  He uh  Uh  Colin Ferguson  Yes  No  30 years ago today  And  Yeah  Oh Randy Rhodes  Randy Rhodes  30 years ago today 
[01:47:30]  30 years ago  March 19th  Oh  Wow  Randy Rhodes  Well  Wow  30 years  They should change  It's a crazy plane  That's what they  What  Oh I'm so sorry  Maybe  Perhaps it wasn't very nice  Too soon  Too soon  And died right in front of Ozzy's eyes  Right doing a flyover  No Ozzy was asleep on the bus  As I think Sharon was too  And Randy and  Her seamstress  Rachel Youngblood  Were killed as the plane  Swooped down 
[01:48:00]  And did a flyby  They're probably trying to wake him up  I'm guessing  Whoops  And he hated flying  What did the  What did the plane hit  The bus  The bus that Ozzy was on  So Ozzy's lucky to be alive  Oh yeah  He should have been killed too  I mean in a fair world  Everybody would have been killed  Ozzy's funny  So how did he survive it  He was in the back of the bus  Or something  Yeah the wing  Because I believe the wing  Clipped the bus  And just fucking  The plane flipped or whatever  Wow  Oh yeah  Satan saved Ozzy again  Was Randy that good?  Oh yeah  He was young  He was 26  But he was that good of a player 
[01:48:30]  Yeah he really was  He was fucking great  Classical  He loved  Ozzy would take a guitar lesson  In every town  Like he loved these old  Fucking classical guitar people  And he probably would have left Ozzy in 83  You know what I mean  It's like  Probably he'd still be there  But  How long was he with Ozzy?  A few years  Three years  Four years  That's it huh  Yeah  But they were good friends?  Yeah  In 1980  They hooked up I think  And then they did Blizzard and Diary  Very close together  Which is lucky for Ozzy  No shit  And he credits Randy Rhodes completely 
[01:49:00]  Well who was Randy playing with  Before Ozzy met him?  Quiet Riot  He was?  Him and Rudy Sarzo  I don't know any of that shit  Oh yeah  There's a great guitar solo by Randy  He would dress  And again it's fucking  You know 1979  But he would wear like  This weird little vest  And this little polka dot  Fucking bow tie  And there's one of his guitar solos  From the fucking Quiet Riot days  Online  He was just  He was great  He was just a great  Fucking young guitarist  Terrible  More importantly  I want to hear more Ted Knight  I don't know what it is 
[01:49:30]  What's that Lou?  All we have is  Mary Tyler Moore and Caddyshack  Right?  What else was he in?  That fucking sitcom  It came out  It was horrendous  Crazy Cow or whatever  Too Close for Comfort  Too Close for Comfort  Jim J. Bullock  Jim J. Bullock  Do you have like  A Greatest Hits  Ted Knight  Thing  Or something?  But there's a lot of  A lot of Caddyshack in there  Yeah  But put like  Mary Tyler Moore  Ted Knight tribute  Oh  We  How did you get involved 
[01:50:00]  In this Monroe?  Sit down Monroe  I could say a lot  Of other things Monroe  What do you want Monroe?  Oh it's all Monroe  See he was more serious  He wasn't a goofball  In that show as much  Yeah we like the goofy Ted Knight  Yeah  How was  Speaking of music  How was Springsteen?  I'm so bummed I missed that  For reals  Oh he was  Just marvelous  What an entertainer  Yeah  What an entertainer 
[01:50:30]  All around  Roll and get his picture?  Oh no  Of course not  But I may have made  The connection  But wasn't the connection  That day  For everybody  For next time we see  You know  Bruce from three feet away  That Bruce does a show  Yeah  Three feet away  For the ten year anniversary  Of satellite radio  It's  No but again  We used that to get  The connection  To maybe get with him  Right  The company did  The right thing by roll  They gave him the third row  Nice  He had better seats  Than Tom Hanks  Really?  Yeah he got amazing  They took great care of him 
[01:51:00]  That's great  And I almost  I tried to get him  Into that back room  But it was  Not happening  But when I saw  All the people  Piled into the room  Springsteen's private room  I kind of got it  And I spoke to  Bruce's private  The guy who does  His security  Who's solely responsible  For Bruce  And even he couldn't  Do it that bad  Because it was so crowded  With friends and people  So I kind of got that  Right  Nobody was being a dick  About that one  That was just one of those  Things where  You know  He wanted his private space  With people he knew 
[01:51:30]  And I got that  Sure  So  But I think that  Roland will get it  At another venue  He could just  Screen grab this picture  That's him  Yeah  He's in every fucking shot  Where's Roland?  That's Roland?  Yeah  That's Roland  That's awesome  And there's Bruce  Holy fuck  Yeah  Just screen cap that for him  Oh I didn't show you  I'll show you a cool picture  Because Bruce was so cool  He came down the fucking  He came down the aisle  Oh yeah  He was in the audience  He was in the audience  He was awesome dude  He was  I can't say enough 
[01:52:00]  Good things about this show  I saw him once  I think during the Nebraska thing  Where he did the whole Nebraska thing  Without like hits  Oh yeah  No hits  And it was good  Really good  I think that was  The only time I saw him  Yeah they were  Like to see him there  With the E Street band  It was just so many people  On stage and shit  Roland  Did you enjoy your  Springsteen?  What?  Hold on  I know  I decided to  Look at how close he was  Holy fuck  So you got a picture  With Springsteen technically  Yeah yeah  That's pretty cool 
[01:52:30]  Who are those idiots?  They're just people  In the audience  Audience idiots  I need to know  Who had worse seats  Than you guys  Sway had better  Did he?  Sway had better seats  Wait better than you?  Oh no no  You shouldn't be bitching today  I see you  You're in the third fucking row  I had no problem  I see you  I was fine  I saw the show  Heard it  Right across the aisle  Was fucking Gary, Fred  And their people  So it was almost like  Nobody at the company 
[01:53:00]  Wanted to hear shit  From the show  We got the exact same seats  They know now  They finally know  But they were great seats  That's good  That was beyond awesome  And Roland they took  Extra good care of  Oh yeah  Which was the right thing  Good  They hear Bruce scream  See him sweat  Nah I'm just fucking right  I'm sure it would have been  A tough night  To get a picture with Springsteen  Oh yeah yeah  There were so many people  But it's funny though  Jimmy goes  In this Bruce private room  He goes Bruce  And he just turned around  Oh yeah I got Bruce's attention  Because there was only  A couple people back then  And we were sitting  On a sofa back 
[01:53:30]  It was almost like  The only thing separating  Our area  From Bruce's area  With the seats  Back to back  And then there was doors  To get into his area  So we had like an open area  Into Springsteen  And he's probably 15 feet away  And I wasn't yelling to him  I was like  I was waving at him  And he was like  Looking at me like what  And I'm pointing at Roland  And I'm holding my camera  I'm like  But I couldn't convey  I don't know if he wanted us  To come out  Like he thought  I wanted him to come out  But I was like  I was trying to get him a photo  But  Yeah that wasn't gonna happen  Nah it was alright  I tried but fuck it  Yeah 
[01:54:00]  I saw all your pictures  On Twitter  Both of you guys  It was a fun night  A lot of new listeners  Holy fuck  It was fun  Anybody there  Michael Douglas  What pictures  Jamie Foxx  Of Paul Red  Love Jimmy  What pictures  Didn't you get  No one  The only one  Was Conklin from the Giants  But again  He  When he was walking in  He was with his wife  And people were chanting for him  So there was  The time was like  He was just getting to his seat  I asked at a bad time  And I wasn't prepared  So that was my fault  You guys talked about  All this already  Oh yeah  Everybody was cool though  I'm just curious  Everybody was nice  Did he have any special guests on stage 
[01:54:30]  No  Nope  Didn't bring anyone out  No  He only did that for South By  Did he like it  Did you stay awake for this one  Oh I stayed awake for this one  Good  Good to know  This sounds awake  No Keith Richards  Or any of the guys  From the Stones  No  No thank God  Why thank God  I mean in the audience  Oh no  On stage  He's very protective of Bruce  He doesn't like other people  Sharing the limelight  And then they'll do like another song  I'm like  Ah they're talking up the stage  They're like  Leave 
[01:55:00]  He loves Bruce  You want Keith Richards to leave  If he was asked to play with Springsteen  He loves him  Because he'll be like  Doing the whole thing  And you're like  Ah  Just go  You wouldn't care  No  That's a weird guy  Who would you want to see  Springsteen sing with  I don't know  I saw it with Bob Dylan  And a bunch of people  And it just was like  Ah there's one less good song  He's going to perform  It's Dylan  I know but he's doing  You don't get to see Dylan  You didn't care  No  I didn't care 
[01:55:30]  Fair enough  I guess  What song did he do with Dylan  Highway 69  Isn't that good  Great  And some other song I saw  Yeah  Yeah  You're not a big Springsteen fan  Did you like the show of him  Yeah I liked it a lot  Yeah  You did  Yeah he was great  He really was  He's a great performer isn't he  Yeah  You know I'm not fucking gonna  Probably ever go to another show  But you can see why people  Are fanatic  Yeah  Fanatical  About him 
[01:56:00]  Yeah  He's  What is he doing there  Oh I know  A couple of times  He climbed the rafters  Made me very nervous  He was climbing up the balcony  He was jumping  And amazingly  And Steven Singer  That's Steven Singer  Where  Right there  Where the cursor is  Oh it's hilarious  Is that Rosie O'Donnell  Oh that's funny  Dumb Steven Singer  Stupid Steven Singer  Probably trying to give him  Some of his jewels  Yeah take a rose  Yeah  Enough of your dumb roses  Oh Mother's Day 
[01:56:30]  Right around the corner  Fuck  Oh god  That's cool  Isn't Springsteen like 60 though  62  And how do they  Prevent him from being  Pushed over by these lunatics  That are all excited  That he's right in front  I know  Isn't that odd  They like trusted the people  Yeah you would think  The people would get out  Of control by accident  Look at Steven Singer's  Stupid face  Look at that  Look at that  Hey who's that  Trying to get a peek  Of Springsteen  Look he's bending his head  Around that person  Rosie was there huh 
[01:57:00]  What  Isn't that Rosie  In the front of them  It looks like it right  It does  She's not doing anything else  Oh she's not  I could have consulted  Elo and Oprah  On that fucking move  That was not gonna work  Oh yeah  Rosie O'Donnell  Of course not  When Rosie O'Donnell  Was beyond  Popular in  Daytime TV  She was basically  Ellen DeGeneres  Ellen DeGeneres  Is massive with her show  Right  That was Rosie's spot  And Rosie's show  And Rosie  No one officially knew  She was gay yet 
[01:57:30]  She'd come out  And talk about  She has a crush  On Tom Cruise  She had the proper  Hair cut  The makeup  She dressed nice  And then when  Rosie decided  To tell the world  She you know  Was gay  She became  Abrasive  Rosie  It's a different  Version of her  No one's gonna  Buy that version  Of Rosie O'Donnell  Looking all gruff  On TV  Yeah she doesn't  Put a lot into  Her appearance anymore  Just the basics  Back then they had  Her polished man  Yeah she doesn't 
[01:58:00]  Try to look like  A lady anymore  And she softened  Her delivery back then  Too now she just  Let's it all hang out  Which is fine  But for Oprah  To think that was  Gonna work  That was just  Stupid  Crazy  I mean Rosie's talented  But not  Not what  Oprah was hoping  For there  No  Right  Absolutely not  Less than five months  Yeah  Yeah five months  And the ratings  Were just abysmal  190,000 people  A show  But what is 
[01:58:30]  Oprah's other shows  Doing  Like what is  The viewers  Not much more  Not much more  We're talking to  More people here  I've heard they're  Very disorganized  Over there  And I've not  Heard that from  Elo  I know somebody else  Who is actually  Working  For who's gone now  I don't even know  Where the own channel  Is on my cable network  And of course  I'm not abroad  But the reason why  I should know  Is because we  Kind of care about  Elo still  And curious  What he's up to  So I would like  To take a peek  Sure  I don't know  Where it is  And I don't  I don't need  And I'm not 
[01:59:00]  Going to search it out  I don't care that much  Right  That's a problem  With all these channels  Is that so many of them  You don't know  Where they are  I have no idea  What is TBS  I don't know  I really don't know  I was saying  People like Conan  Or Rosie  Who are big fucking  Even Oprah  Is having  It's hard to find people  Even if you know  Who they are  You don't know  The fuck  It's not the main  Three channels  And I used to know  And then Time Warner  It's been a little while now  But then they changed  Where all the channels  Used to be  Oh yeah  They switch them around  So now I really get 
[01:59:30]  Really  I don't know  There's a way to have  Your favorites  But it's just a nightmare  Finding shit  Yeah  But I knew  The Rosie thing  Wasn't going to work  I think Oprah's going to  Have to go back on  And do her dumb show  To save her network  Yeah  People are speculating  Are they speculating that  She's going to have to do that  Yeah  Yeah  Because she's got so much  Invested in this  This network  Right  To have it just fold  And then Rosie went out  With a one-on-one interview  What  Yeah  That's dumb too  But that  You're talking about  The interview she did  With 
[02:00:00]  No I mean  With Coney  Now that would be  A big one  She did a Whitney Houston  Family interview thing  Who did  Oh you're talking about Rosie  No Rosie changed  Her whole format  Yeah  She went with  Sort of the Oprah thing  Right  What Oprah was doing  Sort of  And then she completely  Changed it halfway through  And said no studio audience  Just one-on-one interviews  Yeah  How is that going to work  At first she was trying  To have fun  And be the fun old Rosie  She had a game show segment  And all kinds of  Shenanigans  And music 
[02:00:30]  And things like that  And then she just decided  Well I want to go  One-on-one interviews  No audience  And then she approached  I guess Oprah's people  With that  And they were like  Okay great  Because it saved  So much money  Oh really  And they knew  That the show  Wasn't  The show was already  Bleeding  Well it must not  Have been  It must  Can you turn it  A little bit  It must not  Have been  Rosie O'Donnell's show  Canceled by own  Described as a fucking  Hellhole by staff  Staffers from the  Rosie's show  Are coming forward 
[02:01:00]  With some great quotes  It was such a hellhole  Said one staff member  The reason  Hold on  O'Donnell's frequent  Temperamental clashes  With the Rosie show  Staff  During a taping  Last fall  O'Donnell uncontrollably  Yelled at a publicist  Backstage  Because she didn't like  The parameters  Agreed upon for an interview  Well you know what  You know what  We've done the same thing  I agree with Rosie on that  She's the fucking publicist  There's nothing wrong with that  Because she needs to get  Some interesting stuff  Out of these celebrities  We sit here  Looking like idiots sometimes 
[02:01:30]  Pulling pubes out of her teeth  Or not  I gotta agree with her  The fucking publicist  Has probably agreed  Okay now Rosie  Won't ask that  Don't talk about that  Several staffers  Were also upset  When O'Donnell clashed  With Oprah Winfrey's  Long time director  Joe Terry  People thought she  Humiliated him  When she scolded him  In front of a live audience  For using the wrong  Camera shots  Rosie suggested  He didn't know  What he was doing  She fired  Winfrey's stage manager  Because she felt  He was ignoring her  And not doing his job  Properly  She was also unhappy  With her band leader 
[02:02:00]  He was an Emmy winner  Because he couldn't  Play an obscure  Broadway song  Yeah he couldn't  At the drop of a hat  Play like obscure  Broadway show tunes  Please  Yeah but you know what  That to me is not  That to me is  Nitpicking in it  That to me is  It looks like  It was an Oprah staff  Working for Rosie  And Rosie wasn't  Happy with certain  Right  Right  And you know what  If the viewership  Was terrible  Maybe she wanted  To shake everything up  And maybe she's  Getting no viewers  Which means she has  To be nicer to guests 
[02:02:30]  And maybe the publicist  Did the right thing  Who the fuck knows  Yeah  I hope Eric Logan's  Okay over there  Elo must be a little  Getting a little nervous  Although we'll certainly  Welcome back to radio  Oh you know what  Oh my god  I'm willing to say  And I don't have much  To say about anything  In this company  But I'm willing to say  That Eric Logan  Would be welcome back  To Sirius XM  Satellite Radio  With open arms  Can you imagine  If he came back  And the first thing  He did was fire the show  That would be hilarious 
[02:03:00]  A brilliant move  Yeah  Get to kick those dummies  Out of their offices  Knock down some walls  Give Elo one big office  Hey when are they  Building more offices  I understand they're  Doing more studio space  When does that begin  Do we know  Really  They've been saying that  For a long time now  I've heard that we  Make it a bigger studio  Yeah  I've heard a lot  Well  I've heard that from myself  I've heard a lot of things  Oh from yourself  No no no  I'll confirm that  I think Kenny  Who told you that  Well I heard it from Norton  Kenny likes to start  A lot of rumors  A lot of rumors  Does he  Cramden told me 
[02:03:30]  He makes shit up  Every single day  And then decides  That this is what  He's going to tell  Everybody that he sees  In the building  Yes  Kenny what are you  Working today  Well while you were  Gone GH  Sam has a new show  What's the show called  The busy buddy show  With Sam and Troy  The busy buddy  Yeah  Like busy buddy  But busy buddy  Is this the official  Name of the show  Yeah the busy buddy show  When is it on  But people don't  Understand  When is it on  It comes on  When you guys are done  At 10 o'clock  Oh so now it's called

[02:05:00]  I'm not dividing anything  I don't think he wants  To be a co-host  Yes Kenny  We're two guys  Who like to wear hats  For attention  Oh  They do  And where's a hat though  Yeah I could think  Yeah but he's not  He has the Opie and Anthony show  This is the busy buddy show  Sam and Troy  Oh right  Is Troy psyched to be part  Of the busy buddy show  And where is Troy today  He's in the other room  We're two guys  Who like to judge  And make fun of people  It sounds like 
[02:05:30]  It's getting a little personal  I can't quite put my finger on it  I'm just describing  What he's doing right now  Kind of  Oh  Oh  Kenny's talking  Oh I didn't realize  Ah Troy Kwan  Your radio partner has arrived  Yeah your sidekick  I like this  We're two guys  Who are both short and tall  What  I mean  That's one of their promos  They just keep getting stronger  One too many  They just keep getting stronger  There's more G-Hers  A lot  One too many  Hold on  Someone's coming in  Wearing Ernie's shirt  I just gotta make sure

[02:06:30]  Sam  You're ungrateful  I'm promoting your show  You're ungrateful  Young ungrateful  You want other people  To come up with promos  For the show  Who doesn't know  Kenny's a moron  That's what I take  Exactly  We're two guys  We're two guys  Who have weird diets  And eating habits  Did you write all these down  He texted them to me  He's told everybody  In the building these  Really  Yeah  He has one set of jokes  Are you happy  That you're now  A co-host  I mean I'm not a co-host  I just come in  And hang out with Sam  No you are  According to Kenny  They're very modest 
[02:07:00]  Are they  Yeah  Yeah  They're trying to  You know  Troy's aware that Kenny  Just makes shit up  To fill his empty days  Right  Troy is that true  Yeah  Absolutely  And he tells everybody  In the building  Yeah  To the point where people  Are coming up to me  And going  Oh so you took out a partner  And I go  What are you talking about  And they go  The after show  They change the name  And everything  And I go  He's making it up  He just says shit  Because he's got nothing  Going on here  I have the hardest job  Here Sam  I'm responsible  For saving lives 
[02:07:30]  Oh wow  Wow damn  So it's the busy buddy show  With Sam and Troy  Right  Yeah  Troy's not complaining  I think Kenny  Just needs some busy work  Here  Yeah  Apparently he's not  Kept busy  I'm planning a trip  To Cleveland  Yeah  Sounds like a  Huge undertaking  Well we're going up there  For Jimmy  Yep  That's right around  The corner now  You're going for the fans  For the fans  Yeah  You're doing a live broadcast  Who's going for Jimmy then  That's Aunt Solary 
[02:08:00]  Do you know that word  I might have heard  No he just thought  That Anthony had something  Called Solary  Solary  That's Aunt Solary  Yes  She's married to Uncle  Fucking  Frito  Yes  But I understand  That they're  Because I'm already going  That they're picking up  Half of my hotel room  For the Thursday night  Wait what happened  What a nickel and dime thing  I'm going to say  For the record  I don't want  Sirius to touch 
[02:08:30]  Any of my hotel  I'll pay for it  I don't need you  To help me with my hotel  Wait what happened though  This is going to cost you  A little bit of money  Why  Oh boy  Wait why  Well Sirius has a  Different business model  Than XM used to  Business model  I'm not going then  Somebody's being a busy buddy  I love Jimmy but I'm not going  I'm not going  I'm reporting facts  I'm not being a busy buddy  That's for the 10 o'clock hour  Whatever excuse you need to make  Wait what  What's going on 
[02:09:00]  No we'll have a little meeting  Wait they want you to pay  For half a hotel  Of my hotel  But I don't care  Why though  Just stay on the other side  Of the room  And say that  That's the side you paid for  Because I have to go there anyway  Which is fine  I do  Why  Because they'll only pay  For a couple days  Or something  Well I guess they have a budget  I ain't going  Tell them right now  I'm not going  A budget  And even the one day  No  I'll ISDN or something  Support Jimmy  I'm not going  I'm out  A budget  I'm completely out  For sure 
[02:09:30]  For sure  Yeah  My time's very valuable  And then on top of  They want me to pay for shit  What would we have to pay for  I don't need half my hotel room  I'll pay for my entire hotel room  Seriously I'm out  I'm done  I would have loved to have seen people in Cleveland  But it's out of principle  I can't do this  No don't make your fans suffer  They're not going to suffer  What do you think they do every day  Between 6 and 10  He called you in here  10 o'clock  Good one  That was a pretty good jam  He got you with there Kenny  You can hear more of that 
[02:10:00]  In the 10 o'clock hour  On the Busy Buddy show  With Sam and Troy  Well a lot of people  Are agreeing with you Kenny  They're saying Sam and Troy  Are like high school chicks  Oh man  Yeah  Chicks  That are and fuckable  Can I fuck them  Yeah  Chicks with dicks  The hottest  Wait what  Can you please tell me  What's going on  Tell me what's going on  With Cleveland  It's okay GH  We'll work it out  Why does you mean  I have to pay for half a room  I only heard that  So I actually don't know anything  About any of the show arrangements  What do you know so far  And how come you said  It's going to cost GH money 
[02:10:30]  That means it's going to  Cause AM money  What's it going to cost  What do we got  Is it the thing we talked about  Yeah  But that's it  What's the thing  This  The thing  This  No no  That better be right  No no  That  That  That's taken care  You've earned that  We get that  Yeah  So what don't we get  An extra night in a hotel  No they  Oh this  Can't wait to see  What it is  No  No you get that  Oh nice  They don't want to pay  For your manservant 
[02:11:00]  So they don't want us  To have security up there  What are they nuts  Well  Have they seen our fans  I think they want to  But why does Jimmy  Have to pay for half a hotel  Because their thinking is  Because it's attached  To the other half  That I'm going anyway  To shoot a special  Right  So they're like  We'll pay for half his hotel  I think on Thursday  For one night  But it's like  I can afford my own hotel  I don't need you paying 
[02:11:30]  For any of it  Yeah I'm out  I'm not going  I don't need you  To fucking  Nickel and  I'll pay for it myself  And I told that  I think a month ago  I said there's no way  We're going to end up  Going to Cleveland  Because they'll fuck it up  I'm not going  Alright let's not make  Hasty decisions  Wait so they  They don't want to pay  For you to go  No I'm on Jimmy's dime  Yeah I paid for  So why is  Why is it costing me an end  Well can't we discuss this  At a more appropriate time  Yeah I love this shit  I brought this up on the air 
[02:12:00]  Just for my own room  They pay a guy  50 to 80 million dollars a year  To not even be here  And they're going to  Nickel and dime us  Get the fuck out of here  Podcast here I come  I'm serious  Maybe  Howard's not here again  GH I got a good idea  Maybe you can get hired  On the busy buddy show  With Sam and Troy  Thank you  Oh busy buddy  Kenny's trying to like  Fucking move on  But why  Why is it going to cost us  Just lay it out  Busy buddy  Listen 
[02:12:30]  They  They do things here  A certain way  It's Jimmy's special  And I'm sure  There's going to be  Sirius XM mentions  In the special  Or somewheres  And then when he  Promotes it on Leno  It's going to be  Sirius XM  What are they doing  It's just a  It's a mind boggling  Way of  Of selective  Nickel and dime thinking  And I've never dealt with it  In any other company  I've worked with  But we lay it out  Because I'm still confused  But they have  They are okay to do that  I pay my own way to get  I don't need them 
[02:13:00]  To pay for my  Half my hotel room  Yeah  I don't  They actually came in and said  We'll pay for half a hotel room  No but I found out  And that was told to me  By the way  Off the air  That was not meant for the air  I brought that to the air  Not Kenny  No no but I'm saying  I don't want Kenny to get yelled at  That was  This wasn't Kenny  Well that's why Kenny's  Trying to be careful  Yeah yeah  This wasn't Kenny's  But we're asking you Kenny  What are you hearing  This is for a radio show  We're trying to entertain the people  What are you hearing  It's better to have big ears  And a little mouth  I love his old details  And you have those 
[02:13:30]  With a little brain to match  They got to Kenny  Does he have a scar  On his fucking forehead  He's McMurphy  At the end of Cuckoo's Nest  Right  They got to you  Didn't they  Finally got to you  You're going to have to  Throw some big object  Through that glass  So we can get the fuck  Out of here  Ken  No listen  You sound like a beaten man  Cleveland's going to be great  I'm not going  You're not  No  No you are  On a principle  I'm not going  A not only am I not  This isn't going to cost me  I still expect money to go  Did you see Jimmy's 
[02:14:00]  Cardboard cut out  I did not even see  Where  Maybe we can get one  For you too  Yeah that's fine  I haven't seen my  Cardboard cut out  But I owe you  Rock for it I think  If I'm leaving my family  For a few days  I do expect to get paid  So I'm expecting money  Out of this one  Well you get a salary  What  You get paid  I don't get a salary  To fucking fly around  The country for this  This idiot company  Extra money  Yes it's extra money  Everything is extra  Everything  Yes  It's a la carte  Everything is a la carte 
[02:14:30]  Yeah but think all the fun  We'll have  No tell Gary I'm officially  Not going  Oh shit  Do a workaround  It's not going to go over well  Who cares  I'm not  They want us to  What are they  What's going on  Can you write it down  Here's not a spell  This should be  This should be  Oh you can hear more  Digs like that  On Penny  He's writing  G-A-R-E-E  Kenny I  I will make you this promise  I won't  I won't blurt out  What you write  The busy buddy show  10 o'clock  Yeah  It's just the guy 
[02:15:00]  Who came in here  And started all this shit  You spelled love right  But cock wrong  Everyone's begging  Kenny to just blurt it out  We'll blur it out eventually  I'll post it on my  Facebook page  Club Soda Kenny  On Facebook  He loves plugging  That Facebook page  How's that working out for you  Got a lot of people  Yes  Over 6,000 people  Like me  Wow  That's probably  You had something to say  I was going to say  What do you put on that page  Mostly Jim Norton stuff 
[02:15:30]  He starts cracking up  He's cracking himself up  Oh boy  Medic  They got us on the cheap already  So A  No money's coming out of my pocket  Certainly  It shouldn't have to  And B  I do expect to get a little something  If I'm  If I'm going to go away from my family  For the weekend  They hit you right in the pocketbook  Period  You shouldn't have to pay for anything  That's ridiculous  It's ludicrous  But the problem is 
[02:16:00]  You know  I want to support Jimmy  And I love the guy  But I mean  It's out of principle  You have to  What  What  We have to  What  I'm not going  Seriously  Tell him I'm not going  Right now  Sam  Tell him I'm not going right now  You want me to go down and tell him  You're not going  Yeah  Seriously  Okay  That they have to figure something else  I imagine they're listening  I would think so  And they probably know  That's just not happening  They pay a guy  Crazy  They pay a guy 
[02:16:30]  I don't even know what the number is  But it's between 50 and 80 million a year  To not even be here  And they're going to make us do this type of shit  No  I don't need to help that bit  I have to pay for that  We have to pay for  One of these  Yeah  If I'm there this much  I have to pay for one night  And then  And we can't even eat for free  Oh no  Just their meals for one  They're not paying one day for that  You could eat kibble 
[02:17:00]  Dude isn't it amazing  It ain't happening  It's mine  You know I love it  I know  Dude  Please  Because I don't want this to become a thing  No no no no  I understand  Out of principle  There's no fucking way I'm doing this  Because I expect all that  And to be a real diva  I expect a payday too  Because I'm leaving my fucking family for fucking three days  The fact  That's not in my contract to go off and then have to pay for shit  The fact that they won't  I knew they would fuck it up too  I told Anthony  I go look we're not going  Because they're going to end up fucking this up 
[02:17:30]  Certain things  I was booking your flights today  No don't  I'm not going  Why can't they just  Just do the right thing  Like make it like when  People get sent places  They pay for it  And we go  We put on a show  It's good for the company  It's good for us  It's good for everybody  And then we come home  Why does it have to be  Why do they have to go  Well half a room  Add this  So we're not paying for it  They just spent millions on the Springsteen show  Millions  That wasn't free  We're not asking for things  I guarantee 
[02:18:00]  I guarantee  They wrote a check to Springsteen  Rumor has it  Went to one of his charities  He didn't want actual money in his pocket  But he said  Look if I do this thing  I want some money for my charity  That's what I heard  I'm not even positive  Yeah  But safe to say  They spent millions on that  And they're going to make us  Can I say this Kenny or no  Are you too scared  Because I gave you my word  It's up to you GH  Kenny wrote it down in confidence  What's done with that  Is beyond Kenny's  Whatever you think is best  For this organization  And what happens after  September 30th of this year 
[02:18:30]  There's no way  I don't see a scenario  Where we  I personally move  I have mouth  September 30th  I know  But I already told you  I warned you  I warned you  This is real now  They want us to pay  For our security  We got to a stage  In our careers  We kind of need security  We're not divas  We've had shit happen  So they want us  To pay for security  They want us to pay  For one night  One of the nights  We're up there  Because we want to  Fly in Thursday  So we're there  For the show on Friday  The hotel for security  For the Saturday night 
[02:19:00]  They're per diem  For that day  And the meals  They don't want us  To pay for the room  For ourselves  No they conceded to that  Yeah yeah  They want us to pay  For the security guys rooms  Right  For that one night  For the one night  Why  Why can't they just  That's a couple hundred bucks  That's such a  They're nickel and diming us  Over a couple hundred dollars  I'm not  The damage that's done  When they do stuff like that  Far exceeds the dollar value  It really  It's like  I don't want you  Paying half my room  Like I'll save you the money 
[02:19:30]  Yeah  Keep it  You know what I say  Fucking keep it  I say a penny wise  And a dollar stupid  All right dollar  Yeah  You're on two dollar bill  Or something  Right Teddy  I hear you peppy  Oh there goes  The forearm  Oh he's rubbing it  It's like you're rubbing  Snot off of your arm  On him  Do you know how many fans  Online were asking  For the fucking  Chip rub  I said chip rub  They were out of their minds  I gotta get it on video 
[02:20:00]  People want to  They fucking love it  The latest thing  I usually don't deal  With these people  But someone's calling me  A spoiled cunt  Oh  You just don't understand  Nah that's not dude  That's not  Andy in Boston  I'll call you out  You don't get it  This company  Has paid Howard  Hundreds of millions of dollars  That God doesn't even  Have to be here anymore  Basically  And they're nickel and diming  The show that is here  You know  Putting shows on  Five days a week  And we make  Nowhere's near  What Howard's made  Not even close  Our contract sucked  That's not being diva-ish 
[02:20:30]  Expecting expenses  Paid for on the road  And saying look  I just want to go  If you said  Hey I want two  Adjoining suites  For myself and friends  But to say look  I want my expenses  Paid while I'm on the road  Honestly  People listening  There's nothing diva-ish  About that  That's really  You just don't get it  Fucking a standard  And fair thing  And I've traveled  For NBC  And other companies  And that's never even  Thought of  They would never even  Bring up that  Conversation with you  It's not even thought of  And we've already  Put up with enough  Shitter on you 
[02:21:00]  You gotta  You gotta like  Have some pride  And respect for yourself  After a while  Andy if you want to  Be the loser  At your job  And let them walk  All over you  Then so be it  So be it  Then you're not  A spoiled cunt  But guess what  I'm not gonna be  Walked all over  The show would be  Spoiled cunts  If we demanded  A private plane  That's out of line  But that's not  What's happening  It's just standard  Airfare stuff  That is done  In these situations  It's really not  Being spoiled  Because I've dealt  With it  I've traveled  For enough  Different people  Where I kind of  See what is 
[02:21:30]  Acceptable  And what is  Comfortable for  Companies  And it's just  To ask the people  Who are doing  The show  The thing is  Because we're not  Broadcasting  Saturday  And my show  Is Saturday  They would want  The seriousest thing  Where they don't  Want to pay for  Certain things  On the Saturday  Because well  Technically they  Don't have to  Be over the show  But I'm gonna  I'm not gonna  I'm going to  I introduce  Hopi and Anthony  On my show  But that's not  A plug for the company  It is literally  Because you guys 
[02:22:00]  Are responsible  For me having  The fan base  But I really mean that  It's not because  Okay the company  Gets their plug  It's nothing to do  With that  I'm not gonna say  The company name  At the show  Sorry  But you guys  I introduce  Because you're my guys  So alright Andy  I guess I'm a  Spoiled cunt then  Whatever  We just think  Differently  I have more  Respect for myself  They should just  Pay for the shit  That is not  Out of the ordinary  We're not asking  For anything  Out of the ordinary  We're not going like 
[02:22:30]  Hey we want  Fucking limousines  On all the days  Nothing like that  It's just  Get us from  Point A to point B  Give us a  Fucking roof  Over our head  For when we're there  And then get us back  That's all we're asking for  The funny thing is  The company wants us  To get out there more  So when Jimmy's  Taping came about  We're like look  We finally figured out  A perfect thing  We don't want to do  Another Hard Rock Cafe  Broadcast  Because it's the same people  No offense to those guys  Because they're hardcore  And we love them  But we want to kind of  See more of our fan base  So we're like  This is perfect 
[02:23:00]  We're big in Cleveland  Yeah GH  That's good synergy  Someone's reading a book on  Management  Management right  I met with Scott  A couple times  And he said to me  He's like look  I really do want you guys  To get out there  And I don't think  This is coming from him  Like they're not going to Scott  And he's going  No no for the room  This is not something  The president  Can we do  But I'm just saying  Scott this is why  It's difficult for us  To get out here sometimes  Because this is stuff  That he doesn't see  But this is the stuff  That goes on  That makes it not fun 
[02:23:30]  To go out and do the show  Because there's so many  Little moments like this  It's like you can't  Just go out and do it  I think I could say this much  Because you're not allowed  To talk about contracts  Too much  They get pissed off  You give me a tenth  Of what Howard's making  Then this is a moot point  A tenth  But let's start there  Who is  We're completely underpaid  And then they're going to  Make us pay for a night  So we have to pay  For your hotel for a night  Your pay for the day  And meals  No no  I'm with Jimmy  So two of my associates 
[02:24:00]  Would attend to  Oh I see  Who  Who's the person  And again  There will not be  A fucking answer to this  Who's the person  That actually made  The decision  To say  Alright tell those guys  That we  Aren't going to  Pick up the tab  For this  We need  You know  If they want it  They got to pay  For themselves  Who's the guy  Who's the face  Who's the name  That actually said that  I'm not privy  To the chain of command  Yeah  But I would love  Because guaranteed 
[02:24:30]  No one we talk to  About this  That comes down  That hallway  From those officers  Is the guy  That said that  And when we ask  Them who it was  It's going to be  Some obscure  Fucking room  That said it  Well upstairs  Well it's a conglomerate  Of fucking five people  That  It'll never be  Jim  Or Bob  Or Pete  They'll blame the budget  They'll say here's the budget  And the numbers are saying  Well what fucking number  What budget  Then who's  Someone had to say no 
[02:25:00]  And people are amazed  They're like  Look when I go  Look at them all  We don't have to go to the phones  They're like  My company reimburses me  And I'm just a fucking loser  Yeah  Well the company's point  Would be that  They're paying for  All show related expenses  And technically  Because my show  They would have sent you  Home on Saturday  Yeah  Like they would have you  Come out for the taping  And they wouldn't pay  For you to stay there  And come to my taping  They would actually expect you  Just to leave Saturday morning  Yeah  Like  Don't they understand  The equity  In taking care of us too 
[02:25:30]  But like  Not giving us something  That's embarrassing  Like what the fuck  Are you doing  I love you guys  I really do  Jimmy  But I don't blame you  If you're not  I honestly don't  Out of principle  I don't blame you  There's no way  Some guy did some math  This went around  While I was gone  Howard Stern works  112 days a year now  That's 9.3 days a month  Good for him  No of course  He makes  Almost $900,000 per show 
[02:26:00]  All right  And these guys are asking us  To do this shit  Well they  They have to adhere  To a contract  Look  In the end I'll admit  Howard's bigger than us  But he's not that much bigger  To that point  There is a major difference  Going on here  It's contracts  That's what it is  Yeah no I know  I'm not blaming Howard  For having this sweet deal  Trust me  But in the end  It's like  Really  You have no problem  Just shoving all this  His way  But you're going to make us  Pay for a hotel for a night 
[02:26:30]  And someone's meals for a day  I wouldn't care  If he didn't even work here  At this point  It's just the fact  That they can't just do something  That would keep the show happy  And be like  Well that's good  And again  Nothing above and beyond  Right  What should be done  It's the nickel and diming  That drives me  It drives me crazy  It's like in the end  Are they going to miss  What's one night in Cleveland  The total would be $1,500 bucks  That's what the total  The total  They want us to pay 
[02:27:00]  $1,500  So we got to pay  $1,500 bucks  To go to Cleveland  So we can go to Cleveland  Righteous bucks  Righteous bucks  We can write that check  Easily  But it's the  Are you serious?  If you don't go  The busy buddy show  With Sam and Troy  Is going to go  I didn't know  That was on the table  I'll work it out  Thanks Kenny  You're always there for me  Okay  You're not going to go  To Cleveland?  Did you tell?  He wasn't in his office  Of course  He runs away now 
[02:27:30]  Are you thinking about it  Or are you not going?  No I'm out  I'm out  Fuck  I'm reading here  I might go on my own dime  To go see Jimmy  Are you going to go then?  Would you go?  I'm out as far as the company goes  I'm not going  You're going to do the show?  I might just fly in Saturday morning  To see Jimmy on my own dime  Fuck it  I ain't going  I ain't doing shit  For these guys  And you won't be there  For the Friday  Because not only am I  Not paying any of this stuff  I expect to get a little  Extra money  You're negative $1,500  Right now?  No  No 
[02:28:00]  I expect to get a G  I'm reading that  It would cost us $1,500  To go to Cleveland  Yet it costs us $3,000  If we want to leave  Cleveland  That's the  Very good  I didn't catch your name  But that was very funny  No  Nope  Alright  So right now  You're down $2,500  Yeah  Let's figure out a win-win  I like your positive attitude, Kenny  I try  And by the way  Jimmy looks very annoyed 
[02:28:30]  I'm more boggled  Because like  I'm fucking thrilled  With the special  And there's nothing  They can do here  That will screw that up  Like literally  Right  Because it's not  I believe  I keep that separate  It's just the mentality  That goes  Like they don't understand  How that's a fun thing  For the show  And that  It's like  They just don't get that  And it's fine  That they don't get that  I'm not going to be  Nickel and dime  Doing that  Leno would never tell you  To pay for a half a room  Dude it wouldn't even  Oh my god  Right  It wouldn't occur to them  To do that  Like if they don't 
[02:29:00]  It wouldn't occur to them  To say that  We like to think  We like to think  We're bigger than we are  The fact is  We're just fucking  Just another asshole show  Under their  Someone  Under their fucking umbrella  Someone looked over the sheet  With all the cost of everything  Yeah  And went  Hmm  Alright now  See this  Take that off  This  No  Who's that guy  The guy that told us  Day one  That he could get anything done  Oh boy  Gotta blame the main guy  Gary 
[02:29:30]  Oh shit  Because  Honestly  You know what  Me and Ant  Were working for a  Shitty station  Called AAF  Not shitty  We raised the fucking  Bar  Small  Very small  One market  They flew us everywhere  We never thought twice  That they were going to  Fucking charge us  Amazing  That's 20 years ago  Probably  Yeah  15 years ago  They flew us out to LA  A couple times  We didn't have to worry  About shit  All our meals  Were paid for 
[02:30:00]  Yeah  I'm sure we have to pay  For our own meals  Up there  I would assume  We don't have to pay  For nothing  That's what I do  Remember Ant  We just handed the bill  In when we got back  To Boston  Yeah  Worcester  Whatever the fuck  Here you go  This is what I spent  Yeah  And we got reimbursed  Without even a question  Yep  Yes  I thank God  That I don't rely on them  To do that stuff for me  Like I thank God  I am able to do that stuff myself  And I'm financially okay 
[02:30:30]  And I don't  Need them  To pay for  Any of my room  I wouldn't want  I would be insulted  What are you going to  Give me a check for  How much is a room  300 bucks  Are you going to give me  A check for 150  I'll fucking  Thank you  No  I'll handle it  I'll handle it  It's an insult right  It's embarrassing  That's what it comes down to  It's embarrassing  It's an insult  And I don't need it  And I don't want it  It's not about the money  Trust me  No  It's not the money  People understand that  It's not about the money  At all  It's not the money  I got it in my wallet right now  I would hand it over 
[02:31:00]  It's the principle of it  If it was about the money  Jimmy wouldn't be at  Uncle Vinny's Comedy Club  In Point Pleasant  This Friday and Saturday night  That is true  Yes  Working on material  For the special  And then Caroline's next week  March 29th  Through April 1  I'll probably just fly up  On my own dime  I don't want  I don't want  Sirius XM  Or any of that shit mentioned  And I'll go see Jimmy  And I'll fly back  On my own dime  On Sunday  Without these idiots  Will you do the show  On Friday  Live from Cleveland  No I'll do it from here  That's what my contract says  I'll do a show Friday 
[02:31:30]  Then I'll fucking get on a plane  Just to see my pal  And it'll have nothing to do  With this stupid place  God  They just  It's mind boggling  They don't get it  It's like  I try to be pretty balanced  And reasonable  In asking for stuff  Like I don't expect us  To get  Like  I'm not asking for anything crazy  Like I didn't even ask them  To pay for shit  But I just  Stay out of my  Like don't pay for  Half my hotel room  Don't  Don't do that  And for the people wondering  I really  When I was on vacation 
[02:32:00]  I said you know  I'm gonna come back  And I'm just gonna  Fucking go with the flow  Yeah  But they make it impossible  Because then there's  Something like this  That is just so mind boggling  Of course you gotta  Bring it up on the air  Alright  Unbelievable  Yeah man  I'll support you Jimmy  I'll figure it out on my own  I don't need this fucking  These fucking idiots to do it  Bob but I  But I completely understand  I'm psyched and happy for you  I completely understand dude  I  And you're not being  A cunt or a diva  Because what you're asking for  Is not unreasonable  Well Andy  It's not  Andy's wrong though 
[02:32:30]  Andy in Boston  Has no problem  Letting people walk all over  And that's you  That's fine  I'm not gonna argue that  With you  If that's how you  Let's argue with me  And that's gonna sound  Passive aggressive  Sure  But that's  It sounds like  You don't have  Much self worth  And you're a little  Active aggressive  That's better  Yeah  Much better  Active aggressive  Hey Kenny  Is there a piece of shit  Fucking worthless  Want to be intern around here  To get me some  God damn soup  Out of point  I'm important  Soup time  I thought you were talking  About Kenny  Before you said intern  Ah

[02:34:00]  Oh  Fuck  Kenny's upset  Kenny's upset  Because the other day  On the after show  Cause Kenny calls up  With some bullshit  On the after show  He's got an hour to kill  Not talking about anything  Is this a promo  For the busy buddy show  It sounds like  We're two guys  That got an hour to kill  He calls up  But why do you  Leave him on the phone  For twenty minutes  I would say  Cause I don't like  To hang up on him  Because he's a sensitive guy  Danny and Troy  Actually had to come in  And say for real  Hang up on him  You're being schooled  Yeah  Or I'm gonna hang up 
[02:34:30]  The phone  I'm gonna push the button myself  Cause they're so sick  Of hearing his dumb voice  On the radio  Talking about nothing  Absolutely nothing  You are getting  A little big for your  Britches over there  Yes  Small britches  Six thousand people  Would beg to differ  With you  Everyone that likes  Them on Facebook  Maybe  Maybe  Six thousand likes  Beg to differ  Maybe if you just  Called up  And plugged  Jim Norton's stuff  All the time  Then your Facebook fans  Would be satisfied  I do 
[02:35:00]  Yeah and you love  That show  To promote your  Facebook on  Exactly  You do  Club Soda Kenny  On Facebook  Don't get left behind  He's unflappable  Oh yeah  He's  By the way  We were going to the  Fucking  To go to the airport  For Orlando  And we're merging  In traffic  And these fucking  Scumbag bus drivers  In this city  They are the worst  When it comes to merging  Like they try to go 
[02:35:30]  Nose to ass  In the car in front of them  And in fairness  Kenny had  Cut around  And did a real  Dick move  But we're merging  In and I'm  I'm livid  I'm like  Will you  Fucking honk  At this cocksucker  Because he won't  Let you merge in  And Kenny rolls  Down the window  And I'm like  Finally  And he goes  Mr. Be kind  That's me  Mr. Be kind  Mr. Be kind  That shit drives people  More nuts  Than yelling at him  By the way  But that's  That's a true 
[02:36:00]  Tough guy  Who can just be  Who's not  I'm just such a little  Napoleon shit head  Fucking coward  Love it  I  I need my soupy  What happened to my pot?  I know  But we were busy  Promoting the  Busy Bunny show  At Sam and Troy  Exactly  Kenny forgets  He actually has a job here  I can multitask  Apparently not  Howard said that  SiriusXM charges him  For equipment repairs  And equipment upgrades  Really?  I think that happens 
[02:36:30]  To us too  I haven't bought  New ratings in a while  No he owns  Everything  He probably owns  So much  Yeah we're probably  They're probably  Going to charge us  For the sticker  I bet we're buying  That sticker  We're going to get  A bill for that one  I bet  I'll send it to EROC  He's the one  That technically took it off  And he's rich  He's got that  Nagel cash  He's got plenty  He was posting pictures  On his Facebook  Of his new carpeting  And shit  He's got it  Forget about it  I know it's amazing  He's got it  The Nagel fortune  You got it righty  I'm doing alright  Doing alright  Posting pictures  Of his castle  Grayskull  It's no problem  Are you guys going to Cleveland 
[02:37:00]  I thought so  I mean  But it's very contingent  I think  On Opie and Anthony  Being there for the show  Oh you guys can't just go  Well if Ant's his own guy  If he wants to go  I'll just ISDN from here  Why don't you  And just have the cut up  The cut out  Why don't you guys  Do the franchise show  Yes  Eric  Is it  The cut out  Costs money  GH  It's going to come out  Of your pocket  Yeah of course I did  I'm paying for my cut out  What's your cut out for 
[02:37:30]  It was a goof  Like it was a goof  When celebrities are here  And I'm not here  Oh it's hilarious  Because like John  What was his name  John Bertham  Berthal  Berthal who I love  From Walking Dead  Was here the day  I was in LA  Would that be an official picture  For your collection  No it's a goof though  But I will put them  I just grab my cock in it  Like it's really funny  Yeah it is funny  To have celebrities  Take a picture  With this shitty cut out of me  And my arm is all out  And it's too tall  Because they couldn't do  5 foot 7  Yeah it's too big  The picture is too  I didn't see this  This was coming last week 
[02:38:00]  Why couldn't they do 5 foot 7  Because they only do it  Per foot  I gave them your measurements  But they said  We can either do 5 foot  Or 6 foot  So I figured  5 might be too small  Here's the cut out  You guys didn't tell me  About this  I haven't seen it  You guys got to  Put it in the back  And do a forced perspective  Thing  You're too big  And look at the space  Under it  It's too big  Did you tweet this yet  Yeah yeah  That's been out  You got to put it  Further back  So it's forced perspective  And it looks smaller  Maybe that'll work  Why didn't they 
[02:38:30]  Why couldn't they  Make it the right size  Kenny  It didn't come in half sizes  It was either 5 foot  Or 6 foot  Why though  Why can't they do it  In half sizes  They just can't  He's so big  That's hilarious Jimmy  This is the first  I'm seeing it  It's fucking hilarious  For what I'm calling  You're such an idiot  I don't want to miss  Celebrity pictures  It's too big though 
[02:39:00]  That's Jimmy  I really wish they could  Do exact life size  Because even though  More Jimmy equals  More gooder  As we all know  Life size would be better  But can't you find  Another company  That could do it  Probably  The proper way  A lot of the companies  All were doing it  Per foot  How about another company  But did you bring it up  On air  Maybe someone has  An angle on this  We did it right now  Someone I guarantee  Could do this properly  Yeah and I will  Because that's hilarious  It has to be your exact size  And you can see  There's like a couple of  Inches below the shoe  No but your head's too big  Yeah the head is too big 
[02:39:30]  But I also  They should put  I should put both feet  Even next time  So this way  They don't have to  Do a perspective  Wait we get it  I'm babbling  We've all been babbling  For the last half hour  Alright  I don't know  Let's go to break  With the Joseph Coney song  Well I mean  If people want it  I think they do  Joseph Coney  Eats pepperoni  And he's full of bologna  Joseph Coney 
[02:40:00]  Eats pepperoni  And he's full of bologna  The Opie and Anthony Channel  He's so horny  Mysterious XM  Nobody is supposed to touch  Your private parts  Don't touch me like that  Don't touch me like that  No  Nobody is supposed to touch  Your private parts  You know I really like you  But I don't like the way  You touch me  Touch me  Touch me  No  Touch it  Touch it  Stop it  Stop it 
[02:40:30]  Touch it  No  Do you ever hear anything like this  Anus  Anus  Is a useful thing indeed  We all have an anus  All have an anus  Remember that anus  Is the proper word  Anus  Anus  Gives relief in time of need  We all have an anus 
[02:41:00]  All have an anus  No  Vulva  Vulva  Is what girls have down below  Vulva  When she's naked it will show  Penis  Penis  Is what boys have down in front 
[02:41:30]  Penis  Most people call it vagina  Some children call it vagina  Nobody is supposed to touch  Your private parts  Nobody is supposed to touch  Your private parts  Nobody is supposed to touch  Your private parts  Nobody is supposed to touch  Your private parts  Nobody is supposed to touch  Your private parts  Nobody is supposed to touch 
[02:42:00]  Your private parts  Nobody is supposed to touch your privacy. 
[02:42:30]  Sirius XM.  It's the OPR3 Show.  Hi, listen.  People are going to get mad, but we've got to go back to what we were just talking about.  I swear.  You can even time me.  Give me one more minute.  Please.  Because me and Jimmy just went to the bathroom.  Ah, sexy.  And Jimmy reminded me of something.  When we first started on Satellite Radio, we fucking traveled everywhere. 
[02:43:00]  We were doing a trip almost once a month, maybe once every two months.  Yeah.  And XM at the time, they paid for everything.  And even, Jimmy, you know, we're fair.  Yeah.  We're like, maybe XM went too far the other way.  They went a little too far, yeah.  But they would fly us and our chicks everywhere without even ever asking for a dime.  I brought my now wife and Jimmy's girlfriend at the time, Ann's girlfriend at the time, trips to L.A. 
[02:43:30]  Vegas.  I guess on numerous occasions, they just paid for our chicks.  Fucking, we took the Xceladon to Washington to broadcast there, paid for our chicks, didn't  even question it, paid for our meals, everything.  And then the other thing, Jimmy, I misunderstood Jimmy.  This company is going to pay Jimmy for a half of one night in Cleveland.  I thought they were-  Enjoy, Jimmy.  I thought they were going to give you two out of the three nights.  You're going to be there for three nights, basically.  Three nights in a hotel. 
[02:44:00]  So I misunderstood you.  I thought they were- Sirius XM was paying for the two nights and then kind of went to  you and said, look, three's a little too much.  We'll give you half the money for the third night.  No, they're going to give you a half a night total out of the three.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's why I said I don't want it.  Yeah, and that's insulting.  I literally don't want it.  Because that basically means they're going to give you $100.  Yeah, something like that.  That's insulting.  It's embarrassing.  It doesn't matter how much money you make out there.  That would be insulting.  I'm actually not making much because, honestly, because of the expenses in the theater, I'm 
[02:44:30]  charging ticket prices to recoup because you have to pay for the theater and all that stuff.  Right.  I'm making much less on this special than when I did HBO, but I get to own this one.  So hopefully, as years progress, you make back end.  But I'm not making a lot on this.  I'm in a tough spot because now fucking Cleveland people are mad at me, but this is what I'm going  to do.  I'm fucking not going on Sirius XM's dime at all.  I'm not doing the show Friday.  No fucking way.  But I will fly Saturday morning after we do a week of radio here in New York to see my 
[02:45:00]  pal Jimmy on my own fucking dime.  And I'll meet whoever the fuck wants to meet me after the show.  And then I'll fly home Sunday on my dime.  That's what I'm going to do officially.  I'm done.  I'm done with these guys.  I don't care if they could even work it out at this point.  It's insulting.  Time up.  But it's always like in life, it's almost like it's always the same thing.  Yeah.  Like, ugh.  They make it very obvious that we need to figure out what we're doing next.  They make it so obvious to me. 
[02:45:30]  Yes, Kenny.  We'll work it out.  All's well done.  I don't have a way of putting things.  What did you guys do to him since I've been gone?  Because he's way too happy.  He's just like this.  What's going on, Kenny?  Something changing your life?  You think it was us?  You think it was because I was gone?  You missed me, right, Kenny?  You missed, yes.  I wish I was on the beach with you. 
[02:46:00]  Well, well.  So do we.  I had a black Kenny down there, by the way.  They give you a little guy.  Every room gets a guy.  Your own personal concierge.  Nice.  And his name was Kenny.  So I felt like I was in good company.  Oh, that's easy then, yeah.  You were at a fancy place.  Schmancy, even.  Yeah.  If you go to my Facebook page, you could see the view from my window in Orlando.  I saw.  I took a picture.  It was nice, Kenny.  Oh.  Don't get into that sunset business. 
[02:46:30]  That's my territory.  Don't touch that shit.  That's my shit.  No.  What's going on with the Coney guy?  Oh, that guy fucking lost his mind.  Coney 2012.  Yeah, we'll talk about that in like a second.  Oh, what happened?  What happened?  From the second I came in here trying to read.  Now, as you know, my reading eyeballs have just been a catastrophe.  I've needed like reading glasses at home.  I've been wearing them.  And your stupidity interferes with comprehension.  Yes. 
[02:47:00]  But I've been playing that fucking draw something game.  What is that?  Oh, boy.  Now it seems to be the thing everybody's playing.  What is it, though?  See, you got your iPad, or if you're in my case, just the iPhone, which is a lot harder to do than the iPad.  And you get like a list of words, and then you got to draw it like Pictionary, draw, and then somebody looks at your drawing, and has to guess what it is. 
[02:47:30]  That sucks.  And then they draw something for you.  That stinks.  Well, now I got 30 fucking people that I'm involved in these various games with.  Right.  Back and forth.  Well, last night I was playing it, like, just sitting on the couch, watching TV, and playing this fucking thing.  I swear to you, I cannot see anything today.  Because I was, like, just fixated on the phone.  Fucked up your eyes.  With the glasses.  Now I'm looking at the fucking, I can't see, goddammit. 
[02:48:00]  That's why Kindles are better than iPads.  So there's something about reading with that fucking backlight that's not good.  I don't know if it's that, or just the fact that I'm, like, straining.  I think that has something to it.  Eh.  But I woke up with, like, such a fucking eyeball headache.  I was like, ah.  But the games, you know, it's one of those addictive fucking little app games that you just kind of, ah, this is okay.  And then you realize, ah, I've been playing this for 16 hours straight.  Isn't that addicting?  Yeah, it's kind of a... 
[02:48:30]  Sounds horrible.  You know what?  It does sound horrible.  And I thought so, too.  To be honest with you.  Until I started playing it, and it's like, eh, you know.  What are the words they give you, let's say?  Oh, let's say, like, um, I don't know, crab is an easy one.  You get one coin for crab.  So then what happens?  You might get two coins for something else.  And then you draw a crab, and then someone goes, crab?  Yeah.  And then what happens?  And then they've got to draw something on their list.  That stinks.  I hate it.  That's a terrible game.  Well, you've never played it.  Nor would I. 
[02:49:00]  See, you make it sound like that, but when you're...  I feel like angry birds.  Now you've got to be clever when you draw certain things.  Why?  Why do you have to be clever if you could do primitive, like, drawings?  Well, I usually do stick figures.  Why does that fucking burger have space in between everything?  Why is there air pockets in between your burger?  See, you knew it's a burger, though.  Yeah, I know.  See, some people make the burgers.  Eh, you don't look like a burger.  I don't get it.  How do you win?  Oh, there's no winning.  Yeah.  But wouldn't you draw horribly so they don't guess it?  No, see...  Or do you want them to guess it? 
[02:49:30]  But then why would they guess it if they don't...  You get points for...  I don't get it.  You get points for drawing it.  You get points for solving it.  Yeah.  I don't know either as far as the point system goes.  Wait, but if you want to win, wouldn't you draw shitty so they can't figure out your drawing?  Well, it's not really a win thing like that.  Oh, I got to win everything.  It's more just fun drawing.  You know?  Things like that.  All right.  I do a lot of stick figures, though.  That's like...  Some people really try and... 
[02:50:00]  Like, they got various colors.  I'm just...  Stick figure.  Why is this taking off?  I don't know.  It's not like words with friends or anything.  Well, it is in the same vein as that.  I got sick of that fast, by the way.  Yeah.  Scramble, I play more.  Yeah.  But it's all these kind of games that they got asked for that people, you know, kind of take off on.  I know some fans are playing.  Yeah.  I could always tell a fan playing.  One was...  I guess the word was hose that he was trying to let me know through drawing. 
[02:50:30]  He couldn't just draw the hose.  He had to draw the hose wrapped around a gentleman of color's neck.  Oh.  And that was his way of telling me, hey, I listen to the show.  This is how I draw a hose, because I listen to you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  People think you're really racist.  They were...  I know.  I know.  Are you?  I have no idea anymore.  It's a character.  Is there a character?  I have no clue.  It's a character I play on the air. 
[02:51:00]  During my ordinary life, probably aside from driving, where I do point out a lot of stereotypes  that are absolutely true with people.  When you drive through Flushing, Queens, like I do on a daily basis on the expressway  or the parkway, which has turned into fucking Japan, Vietnam.  It is now legally a part of Japan.  They got scooters?  I can't drive through without a passport.  I actually have to drive through, check with customs once I get into Nassau County.  It's crazy. 
[02:51:30]  And the driving in Flushing is like no other driving you'll ever deal with.  I'm talking the left lane, 30 mile an hour guy.  On the expressway, you notice it?  Oh, yeah.  As soon as you get into Flushing.  As soon as you get into Flushing.  And I turn my head every time and look and I go, bah!  And then I yell out a horrible word.  And it's every single time.  When I see a car doing 30...  Sorry, sorry.  What's your word of choice?  The CH1.  I wouldn't want G-O.  Nah, that's too...  That seems to be hard. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, but that's like military.  It's like the NAMM kind of stuff.  Do you yell that they're the chink in the armor as far as the traffic goes?  No, no.  No, it's just fucking and then, you know, fucking.  Socking.  Word.  Socking, socking.  And then I'll go, that figures, that figures.  Because it figures.  You've been a fan of that for many years.  Oh, yeah.  That figures.  Well, there it is.  Oh, what a surprise.  You know, what a surprise it.  Things like that.  What a surprise. 
[02:52:30]  You should have tolerance because of Jeremy Lin.  Yeah?  Yeah, you should understand those people.  The Lin Sanity?  Yeah.  It's Lin Sanity on the roads.  Is it?  Tell you that.  Yes.  Just get out of the left lane.  I'm not even asking you to not.  You know, if you want to fucking take that on-ramp to a major fucking thoroughfare where  the traffic is at least 55 miles an hour, I don't care if you're stopped at the end of  the fucking on-ramp.  Right.  Because you were doing 20 miles an hour the whole way.  Now you've got your blinker on and your dumb face hanging out your window looking for a 
[02:53:00]  gap in 55, 60, 70 mile an hour traffic.  Because you couldn't figure out what an acceleration lane is for.  That could either be really funny to watch or horrifying because you don't know if you're  going to be the one they try to pull in front of out of nowhere because they've had it.  Or the center median gas station on the parkway is another good one.  They've got to get rid of those.  No, you know what?  That's scary.  They're perfectly safe if you know what the fuck you're doing.  It's a pit stop.  It's a left lane entrance ramp now. 
[02:53:30]  You're getting into the 70 mile an hour drivers.  But there's adequate room to get from the gas pumps onto that on-ramp and get up to speed  to merge in.  But these fuckers, I've seen them, they crawl in there looking over their shoulder and in  the mirror waiting for that magical hole to open up that's going to allow them to blend  into traffic at 30 miles an hour when the rest of the fucking road is doing 70 miles an hour. 
[02:54:00]  There has to be an understanding here that some of these people have no clue how to do  this.  Right.  And I don't know why.  And they look at you like you're a mania.  When five cars whip around you, give you a look, and then cut you off, get the fuck out  of that lane.  It's simple.  You're doing something wrong.  Was I dreaming this or somewhere they're trying to make a law that you've got to go  a certain speed in the left lane?  In the left lane.  Yeah, I heard something like that.  That was something I didn't dream?  Yeah.  Where was it? 
[02:54:30]  I don't know.  Paradise.  Well, they really want to get strict and start pulling cars over that aren't going the proper  speed in the left lane.  Because it's dangerous.  It's dangerous.  It's so selfish.  It slows everything down.  Productivity.  It's just, there are people that don't know the rules of the road.  They know how to fucking, I know, I keep looking at the cardboard.  I think there's people there too.  Yeah, a person there.  I feel like you've been cloned.  Yeah.  I look at these people, and I don't care if you know that you're stepping on the gas  goes faster, stepping on the brake will slow you down. 
[02:55:00]  It's, you don't know the other rules, the subtleties, like getting the fuck out of the  left lane, like fucking merging.  Like when a lane is closed, let's start getting over and get into that middle lane or the right  lane, like there's so many things that people just have no clue of.  You can't just know that the big round thing in front of you turns you and the pedals on  the floor make the thing work.  It's social grace.  Yes.  The social grace in interactions, it's kind of subtle and unspoken. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  The little unwritten rules that we all understand by interacting in the same fucking comfortable  social setting, same as driving.  When you're fucking heading toward a green light and you're texting or whatever the fuck  else you're doing that's got you doing 10 miles an hour and I'm stuck behind you, and  then that light turns yellow and now they decide to take off and leave me ditched at the fucking  light.  There's no consideration for the person behind them.  Now I'm always, and believe me, I drive like a maniac, but in that maniacal driving, I'm 
[02:56:00]  very courteous to people behind me and fucking on either side of me, in front of me, get  the fuck out of the way.  But if there's someone behind me and I know a light's coming up and I see the don't walk  thing flashing, I'm going to go fast enough to make sure they can make it through also  if they want to go fast enough.  You're not slow down guy.  No, I hate slow down guy.  And that thing that's going on in the city where they got the arrow that goes straight  and the arrow that goes right on the one way streets.  And a lot of times if you're turning right, you got a right lane because you don't get the 
[02:56:30]  arrow when I get the straight arrow, but they'll sit there in my lane with their right  blinker on, taking up the entire road.  And now I got to wait for their right arrow when meanwhile I could have gone, but they just  don't think about anyone else behind them.  It's, it's complete self-centeredness and when people drive, they're very, very, it's  very, uh, telling about the country we live in.  And it's such a self-obsession and a self-centeredness. 
[02:57:00]  They don't think of what people are doing behind them or on the sides of them.  They're just, it's all about them.  Infuriating.  And that's what's so aggravating about it.  Mm-hmm.  Like if I'm driving the left lane and a guy is coming up behind me, I get out of the  way.  Oh yeah.  Or I've had guys actually beep at me and I'm like, oh, I'm a cunt.  And I move.  Like I really am going slow and texting.  I don't get angry.  Hey, what the fuck?  Yeah.  Get out of the way.  Hey, fucking beeper, fucker.  Oh, that's right. 
[02:57:30]  I'm a texting cunt and I deserve to be beeped at.  I'm kind, and I don't understand this either.  I'm constantly scanning the mirrors.  You know, I don't think I've, I've been taken by surprise more than a dozen times in  my entire driving career, having somebody come up quickly, uh, behind me because I see  it.  I see it coming.  Well, you're used to the mirrors because that's where you look for school crossing  guards.  Yeah.  You're trying to get somebody into the van.  I have candy.  I have colorful toys. 
[02:58:00]  You, uh, you weren't crazy.  There's a lawmaker in New Jersey that wants to, uh, I might be crazy, but no, you're not  crazy.  You sure?  Yeah.  I'm positive.  You did hear the water discussion.  I might be a little crazy.  Okay.  Maybe you are.  What happened?  No, there's a lawmaker in New Jersey that does want to start finding people for going too  slow on the turnpike.  Nice.  It fucks up traffic.  And apparently they, they already issue like 3000 slow tickets a year, but they want to  do more of it.  What's slow though?  I think, uh, 10 miles under the speed limit, I think is slow. 
[02:58:30]  Cause I've seen some highways where it's like actually going 45 miles an hour on the New  Jersey turnpike.  I've seen signs on, on some highways that say, you know, 65 limit, 45 minimum, you know,  fucking cock suckies.  Are you in agreement that that texting is really fucking bad?  Worse than drunk driving.  I know we're like, I know our whole careers, we've been rebels about everything, but man,  I notice it more and more now.  Holy fuck.  You used to see the, the guy that was drunk every once in a while weaving, but man, nine,  nine, it's let's say 99 out of a hundred times. 
[02:59:00]  You see someone weaving, it is a texter on their fucking text and text and just, they're  going from, from, uh, the speed limit, like 55, 60 miles an hour down to like 45 miles an  hour.  So their speed is real inconsistent.  They're weaving all over the lane.  Right.  And they're fucking texting like crazy.  And I'm not a goody two shoes.  I'd still be texting my ass off.  But what happened was when I got rid of my Blackberry, the one thing good about the  Blackberry, you knew where your fucking letters were. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  So you look down just slightly and you're like, okay, T, you knew where shit was with  the, with these, I got a droid and you got the iPhone, obviously you don't know where  the fucking, you can't feel the fucking letters.  You got to look, you got to look constantly.  But back then you kind of did a quick glance down and went, okay, I can get three, three,  uh, three letters in easy without looking.  That's what made me stop.  Cause I just couldn't, I just couldn't do it anymore.  Yeah.  It's really, I really, I do do it.  And, uh, yeah, your mic fell out of the mic stand, Jimmy. 
[03:00:00]  I do get excited when the traffic slows way down.  Cause then I know I can get some shit done with serious stuff.  I'm like, all right, I can finally get some shit done.  I'm going to check my Twitter.  Maybe I'll even tweet.  I don't know.  I get excited now when it slows down.  It's a nice little fucking gift.  No, am I lying?  I used to be bummed out when you were in bumper to bumper traffic, but now I'm like, fuck,  I could check my shit.  I don't like the traffic as much as I like, like, oh good.  I got stuck at a nice long red light. 
[03:00:30]  I could get this done.  Right.  Uh, but usually if I have to text something, the lights are green all the way.  Like, well, why can't I get a red light now?  Well, I do like stick the phone right up where I'm driving.  Yeah.  I feel like I'm seeing both, but I just don't do it as much anymore.  Yeah.  So that's, uh, all right, that's that another public service announcement.  That'll never fucking do anything from me.  You fucking people just get out of the way, just get out of the way. 
[03:01:00]  But the people that I'm addressing are not listening to this program.  Cause they talk funny.  Some of them.  Yeah.  Real funny, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to say this and now this or not.  And now this.  Oh shit.  Oh boy.  And yeah, we're doing a short break.  It's okay.  We did two hours to start.  Don't worry about it.  And we did an hour and a half.  So yeah, let's do a break. 
[03:01:30]  We'll talk about Santorum and the fucking Coney guy.  We'll get the hell out of here.  Why are you fucking humiliating?  I apologize.  Here we go.  This is the Opie Anthony Channel.  On Sirius XM.  It's almost time to go home.  It's almost time to go home.  It's almost time to go home. 
[03:02:00]  It's the OP Radio Show. 
[03:02:30]  Well, Hurley.  Well, he's on a new program now.  Alcatraz.  Yeah.  And I talked to Joseph Gordon-Levitt.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt.  Who be that?  Conception. 
[03:03:00]  I don't know.  When he was a kid, he was on Third Rock.  Yes, he was on Third Rock.  Oh, that kid.  50-50.  Yeah, no, I know.  50, 500 Days of Summer.  Yeah, okay.  I just didn't know his name.  Big Star.  He's having quite the comeback.  Yeah.  Did the 500 Days of Summer?  What was it called again?  500 Days of Summer.  It was, right.  Okay.  Ah.  With that, what?  What's her name?  Zoe.  Zoe.  Zoe.  Desha.  Desha.  Desha.  Desha. 
[03:03:30]  Desha.  Desha.  Desha.  Zoe Desha.  Desha now.  Desha now.  And then he was in, yeah, 50-50, a movie I liked with Seth Rogen.  Yeah, he said he basically, he just does whatever movies he wants now because he stayed, yeah,  he made all his money.  He still has Third Rock money.  No, no.  He's getting Third Rock money?  Yeah.  What an asshole.  He's a liar.  He's not, I mean, every single week.  He went away because no one gave a shit for a while and he's having a comeback.  He went to college.  He doesn't have to act.  He was in a giant show.  Oh, let me think.  He didn't have to go to college either then. 
[03:04:00]  Should I be in Hollywood movies or go to college?  No one makes that choice.  He had no, he said, fuck, no one's hiring me.  I'm going to go get an education.  He's getting plenty of money.  And then all of a sudden he's making his comeback and now he's making believe that.  He made plenty of money when he was a kid.  He was in Third Rock.  But it's not about the money.  Like, I don't, we don't have to work anymore.  I do still like doing this.  You don't have to work anymore?  No.  Must be nice.  It's been years.  Wow.  Years.  Oh yeah, years.  Yeah.  Years probably.  You wouldn't choose college over making movies? 
[03:04:30]  Jimmy just entered the studio.  A lot of actors go to choose college.  They get tired of it.  They don't know if a liar.  It comes to a point no one wants them anymore.  And they don't want to do the shitty ones like the B movies and the fucking movies on  that sci-fi channel, whatever.  He did Angels in the Outfield.  And now all of a sudden people are into him again.  So he's what's, it's called a comeback and good for him.  People are interested again.  But we didn't talk about any of this during the break.  You have an update on our pal Virgil.  That's right.  We can't get enough of Virgil.  Ant loves Virgil. 
[03:05:00]  Ant loves the Virgil stories.  I love the Virgil stories.  Whenever our own Sam Roberts goes to these events, Virgil from WWF, or yeah, it was F at  the time.  It was definitely F.  He was Ted DiBiase's guy, the million dollar man.  Right.  He was like his little sidekick.  Technically his bodyguard.  His bodyguard.  He would throw a few punches in there if he saw Ted was in trouble.  He didn't take many bumps.  Not many.  Not many.  So Virgil always ends up at these things and Sam just tracks him down. 
[03:05:30]  Hot on his trail.  Hot on his trail.  He knows the subtle things to look for.  The echo in the room.  The empty table.  The complete lack of a line in front of his merchandise.  And it's the same picture every time.  I actually, when you tweeted the picture.  I thought it was an old one.  Yeah, I got back to Sam and was like, that cannot be a new picture.  That's the same one that you took like years ago. 
[03:06:00]  I wanted to chronicle.  Wait, hold on.  Does he know you're taking his picture?  No.  Okay.  Have we explained to the people that there's never a line for Virgil for the new people  that are checking out this bit?  Well, this photo that you're looking at was taken at the very beginning of the weekend.  This is when the convention floor opened on Friday.  When it was hot.  So all the people that were waiting for Virgil.  They're just running to their favorite celebrity.  And then I figured on the way out, we would bookend it and have a picture of his table 
[03:06:30]  the end of the day on Sunday.  So we're looking at two pictures that are very similar.  And it doesn't look like he moved a lot of merchandise or autographs at all.  Nothing even looks must.  There doesn't seem to be any scuff marks on the floor in front of the table.  No.  Like, there's nothing going on there.  Was this a lunch break?  Are you misrepresenting this?  Was there people in front of Virgil ever?  No.  Just every once in a while?  There was never more than two people in front of Virgil.  And an average person there, do they have a small group at all times? 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  I mean, everybody's going to have some downtime.  But sure, nobody, there's nobody who consistently has an empty table on the level of Virgil.  Virgil.  He goes to every convention.  I go to every convention, so I know he goes to every convention.  I've never seen him with a line ever once.  How can he afford to do these things?  I mean...  I don't know.  It's got to cost him a minimum of a grand to go out there and set up for this.  Why did Iraq ask him to sign his fucking belt?  He did it.  Fuck that guy.  Oh, shit. 
[03:07:30]  No, because he ruined the photo and he ruined the belt.  And then I had to pay for all of that.  The million dollar belt?  Yeah.  You want to tell DiBiase only?  Only him.  And he walks into the photo and grabs the belt and puts his arm around me to get into the photo.  I'm a huge fan of the go-to bits on this show.  Did he charge you for it?  I got...  Well, I was paying Ted, and then all of a sudden...  Thank you very much, Eric.  Why would you want Virgil, though?  Those guys were inseparable.  Because you could get him at any event. 
[03:08:00]  So you got him, though.  Like him and Lou Ferrigno are at everything.  I did get an interview with Lou Ferrigno.  Ah, how'd that go again?  You see up here on the TV, that's the photo I tell everybody I have with Ted DiBiase.  That's Ted DiBiase?  Wait, wait, wait.  Can I tell?  Are you sure?  Ted got fat.  Can I say something?  That's Eric.  Million pound man.  Oh, wait.  I want you to look closely at the million dollar belt.  Yeah.  Why is one of Eric's hands black?  Yeah.  Oh, shit. 
[03:08:30]  Wait a minute.  I actually didn't even notice that.  That is Virgil's hand holding the belt.  You had to crop your picture.  Now, you look so annoyed.  This is the photo I tell everyone.  Oh, yeah, I have a Ted DiBiase photo.  This is the one I don't show anybody.  Oh, man.  He walked right into the photo.  Why would he do that?  Now we're looking at a picture, obviously, of Ted DiBiase and Virgil with the Iraq.  Do you know why he did that?  Why?  So then, once the picture was taken, he could demand Iraq give him money. 
[03:09:00]  I had to pay for him because he's in the photo.  This is the Virgil scam.  Now, you didn't tell him, Virgil, get in here.  No.  In fact, I didn't tell him to touch my belt because I put it down while talking with Mr. DiBiase.  Virgil goes, oh, let me, let's, I'll sign it so you have two signatures from the only people who ever held the belt.  And I'm like, Stone Cold Steve Austin held that belt, too, but I didn't ask him to sign it.  Are you going to ask him to sign it?  Because it's Ted's belt.  Oh, my God.  And he just signed it without me looking at it.  Did you pay him?  I didn't pay for the belt, but I had to pay for the damn photo. 
[03:09:30]  Why would you pay for the photo?  Because it was a bundle thing.  I don't remember.  I wish I did now, but I had to pay for fucking Virgil.  About, though, how much did you pay?  You got robbed, man.  That had to have been.  He scammed you.  20, 30 bucks?  No, it was more than that.  He three-car money you're at.  He really did.  He fucking got you.  Iraq thinks it was $80.  I think it was like $80.  You paid $80 for that photo?  It was a thing with Ted to get a photo and for him to sign something that wasn't something  that he was providing. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah, but that's for Ted.  Because Virgil jumped in on it because he signed it plus the photo.  And I said, I'm not paying for Virgil signing the belt.  So they charge you for two photos and an autograph.  Yeah.  Still, $80 is way too much.  Holy shit, you got robbed.  Yeah.  This is Virgil's whole thing.  Like, because there's nobody that comes to his table.  So when a few people do, he just scams them.  Like, the first time I saw him at a convention, I got a picture and an autograph.  And I go, how much is it?  Because he doesn't post his prices.  Because that's part of his deal. 
[03:10:30]  What a scumbag.  Because that way you go, like, how much are the prices?  Wait, can you do the play acting that I really enjoyed during the break?  You and Ann had some fucking chemistry.  Well, like, so here's what happened.  I'll tell you the story.  Let's go through it again.  I'll tell you the story of what happened this weekend.  Okay.  Because I went up to Virgil and asked for an interview.  And he said, not right now.  Not right now.  I'm making some money.  Was there anyone around?  There was one guy there.  I got to make some money, motherfucker.  And so I decided to stand.  Did you ever get, you had to get audio Virgil while you were out there?  I couldn't. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, man.  What happened?  You said, okay.  So I decided to wait and watch the transaction because I know what my experience has been like with him.  So the guy comes up to him and he starts looking at the photos he has laid out on the table.  And now Virgil's smelling a mark.  Virgil, yeah.  So he starts going, hey, buddy.  Hey, buddy.  How about a little old school?  How about a little old school?  Old school?  You like the old stuff, right?  Oh, old stuff.  Like a throwback.  Oh, I like that, Virgil.  You used to watch Virgil on TV, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What do you got?  What do you got?  Which picture do you like here?  Which picture?  Which, what's your favorite picture here? 
[03:11:30]  You see that one?  That's all the old school guys in one picture.  You see that?  Yeah, I like, I like that one.  You see that?  That's me on the cover of the magazine.  How much do you get for that one, Virgil?  You like, which one's your favorite picture?  You like that picture?  Well, yeah, I like that one a lot.  All right, let me, you want me, I'll sign it for you.  You want me, here, let me sign it for you.  What's your name?  I would like a signature that, uh, Anthony.  What's your name?  Anthony, all right, Anthony.  See, I need to know how much this costs, though.  Come back here, let's get a picture.  You want to get a picture?  Come back around here, we'll put the belt on, we'll get a picture.  All right, that sounds cool.  All right, let me come back there.  There you go, say cheese.  Cheese.  All right, and that's 60. 
[03:12:00]  Wait, you didn't get one with your girl, your girlfriend.  What?  You want to get a picture, miss?  I'm here, I don't have a girlfriend.  Yeah, come back around, come back around.  Oh, wait a minute.  Come back around, we'll get her in a picture.  Yeah?  That'll just be 70 then, with both pictures.  What?  And then.  It's $70?  And then he, and then he.  But he never comes up front.  That's 70.  You're right, that's three card money.  That's three card money, that's old carny, old carny's do it.  Virgil's not worth a $15 combo.  That's like when they.  No, no.  That's when you go to the carnivals and they go, yeah, yeah, just try it. 
[03:12:30]  Try the dart, try the dart.  Try to hit the balloon with the dart, here.  Nah, try again, try again.  Do you think guys waste their money who have been trying to go see somebody else so they  don't have that much money?  Oh, man.  So they waste it on him?  And they leave with a Virgil picture.  Wow.  And meanwhile, they wanted, like, something cool.  Tetley or somebody else.  Virgil should be Tetley.  Virgil should be charging $10 for an autograph and $5 for a photo.  $15 combo.  You see, a good combo would be, like, if you get the Jerry Sherbert double scoop, where  you get the picture and you both get to hold, like, scoopers banging into each other. 
[03:13:00]  That would be cool.  Like, you're both hitting the Sherbert scoopers.  I saw some really good photoshops of your wrestling character.  Jerry Sherbert.  Jerry Sherbert.  Is that his name?  I think so.  It should be if it isn't.  That's the beauty of going on vacation.  You get to forget about stuff like Jerry Sherbert.  Everybody thinks he's French.  They call him the amazing Sherbert.  No.  No, it's Sherbert.  Sherbert.  Virgil did the same thing to me at Comic-Con.  That's how I noticed this in 2008.  That's the same scam.  And were you taken? 
[03:13:30]  How much is it?  He goes, it's 20.  And I go, oh, okay, 20.  I said, for a picture and an autograph.  He goes, picture and an autograph, 20.  I go, okay.  And then so he signs it, and he goes, all right, so I'll sign it for you.  So that'll be 20.  And then he goes, you want a picture, right?  And I go, yeah.  And he goes, okay, so just 15 more.  And I go, okay.  And so I go, and I post for the picture.  And he's like, so that's 45.  Wait, wait.  The numbers just keep going all over the place.  45, maybe. 
[03:14:00]  And I'm like, all I got is 30.  And he goes, right, 30.  All right, that's fine.  Oh, motherfucker, that guy.  Because he still got more than the 20.  And I just gave him the 30 cash and felt raped.  Did you want to buy that stuff for 30 bucks?  Oh, no.  No, no.  But in my mind, I was like, the picture, the autograph, and the story is worth the 30.  Yeah, you know.  I want to go up to him and fucking, I never go up to him.  It's not worth 80.  Where were these, by the way?  B-Rock with 80 bucks.  And it's his own belt.  He fucked up.  He fucked up the belt.  He fucked your picture up. 
[03:14:30]  And you can't erase his signature?  No, because the ink is in the foam matting on the back there.  You'd have to cut it out.  Oh, man.  It ain't worth erasing if he did hold the belt.  I mean, it's like, just get Steve Austin on it so you have all of them.  Yeah, that's what you're probably going to have to do.  I don't understand why you wouldn't want him on there, because I'm telling you, they went  as a pair.  Steve Austin was here recently.  Why didn't you get him then?  I didn't think about it.  Stone Cold's not signing anything that Virgil signed.  That's what he'd probably say.  Fuck that.  Well. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, yes.  Virgil's signature devalues the belt.  A hundred percent.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  A hundred percent.  That should just be Ted DiBiase.  A million dollar belt signed by Ted DiBiase is worth more than a million dollar belt signed  by Ted DiBiase and Virgil.  Why doesn't E-Rock start over?  Maybe you need to get a new belt.  Get a new belt.  Aw, sweetie needs a belt.  Just like the ones with your pants.  Get a new belt.  See, that's not necessary.  It really isn't.  You're right.  No, it is, though, because they burst.  Oh, jeez.  Your belts act like fucking Fredo coming in the room. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  We got two Virgil things coming in.  Tim in Baltimore goes, Virgil was at the Baltimore Car Show in February.  I never saw him sign one autograph the three hours I was there.  I wanted to take a picture and send it to the show, but he was just too pathetic looking,  and I started feeling bad for him.  And that's what I'm saying.  This was in Anaheim.  He goes all over the country.  Oh, yeah.  Where are you?  I don't know how he affords it.  That's his gig now.  Maybe.  You went to Anaheim this weekend?  Maybe he's got a little side thing going on.  Yeah, maybe.  Well, another thing, Sam can contest it, that Virgil will promote that Ted DiBiase might 
[03:16:00]  be coming to the event.  So he has the big banner that says, Ted DiBiase and Virgil, WWE superstar.  Because then you go over and you ask him the question, is Ted DiBiase coming?  He says, yeah, maybe later, just so he has an affirmative answer to keep you there.  Right.  And then he doesn't let you leave.  Then he sucks you in and he keeps talking to you until he gets to $70 or, you know, 
[03:16:30]  as high as he can go.  $80.  So what, you flew yourself out there?  I paid for it and then the company's going to pay me back.  Oh, you were out there for them?  I was covering it for WonderCon Radio, yeah.  Oh, okay.  It's complete.  They asked me to do it.  It wasn't.  Oh, okay.  Cool, cool, cool.  John B. O'Connor on Twitter, this sounds like the rappers in Times Square.  Yeah, we've seen this.  Oh, yeah.  They signed CDs in front of you.  Hey, man, you like music?  You like music?  What's your name?  Yeah.  Yeah, I like music.  Well, yeah, you're going to love this, man.  You're going to love this.  It's free.  It's free.  Oh, it's free. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, man.  Just trying to get my music out there.  Hey, man, what's your name?  What's your name?  Sam.  Sam.  All right, let me write that on this.  Sam, you want an autograph, don't you?  Yeah, I'll show my friends out of town.  It's going to be big there.  Okay.  Back home.  Yeah, $25.  You said it was free.  It is.  The autograph, $25.  I'm going to kill you motherfucking white motherfucking crack ass.  Cracker.  It's $25.  Oh, they hand over the $25.  I've seen it happen.  Oh, yeah.  The fear.  The fear.  There's a whole fear thing going on. 
[03:17:30]  By the way.  It really is a certain.  Are they cracking down on that at all?  A little bit.  Yeah, a little bit.  Not so much.  I still see them out there.  Yeah.  People are going to have to start taking photos of Virgil when they see him at conventions  for me.  Please.  Because I'm starting an internet venture.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's Lonely Virgil on Tumblr.  Lonely Virgil.  That might just take off.  I love it.  It will launch later today.  The name's been registered.  Ah, nice.  Yes.  But see, anyone could just get pictures of him standing there by himself.  You got to get like a video that goes fast fucking motion. 
[03:18:00]  There's proof to people no one's coming up at all.  You could send in video.  You could send in whatever you want.  Time lapse.  Time lapse that shit.  A whole big thing.  Hashtag lonely.  Stupid Virgil.  You don't like him?  I love him.  I mean, I don't have any.  He loves the story.  Yeah.  It's a great story.  I think he's hilarious.  He's a con man.  Jesus.  How long since he wrestled?  God, 20 years.  Yeah.  And he never wrestled well.  Why does it say WWE superstar?  Nobody gives a fuck. 
[03:18:30]  No, nobody gives a fuck.  And he never, he's never been anyone's favorite wrestler.  No.  Ever.  Who had a big line there that weekend, last weekend?  Elvira had a very big line.  Enough with her already.  Does she look good?  Wait, is she the old lady?  Yeah, she's got to be really old.  Yeah, I mean, she still wears the wig and stuff.  Who else?  Lou Ferrigno had way more people than Virgil, and he goes to every show.  Lou Ferrigno.  Did he have Hulk pictures?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, signing the fuck out of those, I bet.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And he's got his new celebrity apprentice resurgence.  Oh, okay.  He's got that going for him.  All right.  Peter Mayhew, our old buddy, was there. 
[03:19:00]  Who's that?  Chewbacca.  Oh, God.  Mayhew buy me something if I wish you well or something.  Oh, boy.  No.  That guy's just, uh...  Who else?  Uh, you could see in his eyes, though.  Mayhew will live long and possible.  You could see in his eyes that he was Chewbacca, which is weird, because that's the only part  that, like, was really him.  Right.  Oh, Richard Hatch was there.  Not the survivor guy.  Richard Hatch?  The other guy.  From fucking Battlestar Galactica.  Yes, he was there.  Yeah, motherfucker.  Wow, that's impressive.  Apollo.  It doesn't look like it was a big event. 
[03:19:30]  Well, he didn't...  They didn't...  This is the same thing as San Diego.  Like, it's not giant autograph sessions.  It's more about the panels and the...  Who's on panels?  Well, I mean, like, I did interviews with Hurley from Lost and Joseph Gordon-Levitt and...  I like Hurley.  What's he doing now?  He's in Alcatraz.  And Mila Jovovich.  Playing the island?  So, did you get access to all these people?  Yeah.  You had good access?  It was much easier, though.  WonderCon is much easier than Comic-Con.  WonderCon's smaller, so we're able to get access. 
[03:20:00]  I wonder why.  Emma Stone.  Uh-huh.  Wow.  Oh, Emma Stone.  That was a round table, but still.  Did you see her?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, she sat right across from me.  She was like, what's up, Sam?  I was like, what's up?  She didn't say what's up, Sam.  No, she didn't.  How'd she look?  She looked great.  Yeah.  I asked her what her experience was like on Lucky Louie.  Oh.  Did you really?  Yes, I did.  What'd she say?  She said it was all good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good answer.  Pizer goes after Louie today.  Yes, I read Andrea Pizer's irritating because...  We had her on once, didn't we? 
[03:20:30]  She was fine on the radio.  She was all right.  But she's attacking Louie because of stupid Greta Van Susteren because he's anti-woman.  Louie can be very harsh, but that's who he is as a comic.  And it's like, the fact that...  He's not anti-woman.  No.  Goes after everybody.  The fact that he's answering these tweets, has to answer for these tweets that he sent drunk.  These are the Sarah Palin tweets.  Right.  Yeah.  And the fact that they're bringing it up this much time later.  First of all, if you want to call Sarah Palin a cunt, you're absolutely allowed to do that.  There's nothing wrong with that. 
[03:21:00]  Right.  Just because...  Well, his livelihood should suffer because he did it, though.  Don't you understand that, Jimmy?  That's the world we live in now.  Well, the media penalizes people worse for calling other people cunts, and these women  are going, well, why isn't he...  But just because the media is wrong about the other people doesn't mean that you should  fuck Louie for saying what he feels about Sarah Palin.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Now, they just looked for him out of nowhere, a peripheral part of the story.  Yeah.  And they made it like, well, he said something. 
[03:21:30]  Let him...  It's schoolyard.  I don't see him apologizing at all, and I don't think he did anything wrong.  He didn't.  And FX puts him on because he does a great show, and people watch his show.  There's no reason for him to be in the paper today with a negative article.  At all.  Not at all.  What's going on with that?  Is he all right?  I don't think he gives a fuck.  I really don't.  I mean, he's not the type of guy who panics about this stuff.  His career is too strong.  He's the hottest comedian in the country.  And FX, I'll say, I think sees the bigger picture with him.  It would not be stupid enough to buckle to any pressure to penalize him. 
[03:22:00]  Oh, man, that would be...  To penalize him.  That would kill their credibility.  And they won't do it.  They won't.  Yeah.  No.  Good.  What makes him so good is that he doesn't buckle to stuff like this, so he's just purely  funny.  He lets himself just be funny without worrying, am I going to get scolded for this?  I'm getting all serious.  Are you kidding me, worrying about being scolded?  You're shit.  And Pizer just thinks he goes after, you know, he's a woman here.  She's jumping on it like Greta Van Susteren is.  They're Al Sharpton, but they're white chicks. 
[03:22:30]  That's all they are.  They don't like that he made fun of their guy, their girl in the tarpail.  That's all it is.  They don't give a fuck about anything else he says, but because he makes fun of...  She's so make-funable, though.  Of course she is.  I did not see that.  Dude, her and Sharpton should both be put in a fucking dive belt submarine and sent it  to the middle of the ocean together, and then the cord cut.  Both of them together.  Sharpton was catching some shit.  For what?  His comments that he's made in the past. 
[03:23:00]  I read a few little articles about how MSNBC hired this guy, and his past is chock full  of gay bashing and racism and sexism.  And they mentioned the Greek homo line that he said.  They mentioned faggot.  He said faggot on one of the old talk shows.  I feel like we might have pushed that forward a little bit.  He's one of the people I have mentioned.  I feel like we might have pushed that forward a little bit.  I encourage people to continue reminding that scumbag of his past because he has simply done 
[03:23:30]  nothing but target other people for saying things that he objects to.  And I don't even hate him as much as MSNBC for, like, you fucking dumped Imus for what  he said, you fucking cowards.  And Imus was just being funny.  This guy was serious.  He meant it.  And he still, I honestly believe he still means it.  I don't think he's ever apologized for anything. 
[03:24:00]  I think he's made excuses for what he said in the past and said, well, it was a different  time.  I was thinking differently.  But he's never said, I'm sorry for what I said.  The guy still stands by it, if you ask me.  Of course he still stands by it.  And it's funny.  Where's all the national coverage, by the way?  The white kid who was set on fire by the two, blah, blah.  Oh, that's right.  It was mentioned, did we play that, the Kansas City where they took out the fucking race of  the, uh, the Kansas City news where they took out the race of the, uh, assailants and 
[03:24:30]  what they said to the guy when they, they set him on fire and they took out what they said  something like white ass or whatever they said to him.  Yeah, it was definitely based on, uh, on race.  It was a hate crime.  It would be considered a hate crime.  And, uh, uh, if it was any other way, that's for sure.  But anyway, Sharpton's a twat and the fact that Louie's in trouble or, or not even in  trouble, the fact that it's just being addressed, it's like, you have nothing better to write  about, you dumbbell.  Like, what do you care for? 
[03:25:00]  He's a comic.  Whatever he says should, is acceptable.  Yeah.  I really mean that.  As long as you're not claiming somebody's a pedophile when they're not, or claiming someone's  a thief when they're not, as long as you're not legally slandering them or whatever that  were, you're fine.  And you could, you could in parody portray someone as being a pedophile and being in  parody, but you can't be legally saying that you can't get on stage and go, I happen to  know that this guy's a pedophile, but you can say like, Hey, I'm, you know, I'm so-and-so  and, uh, here's a little boy and I'm sticking my dick into the mouth. 
[03:25:30]  And, and Donald Trump Jr. didn't apologize either.  Right.  And I don't like, I don't like big game hunting.  I think it stinks, but it's a big game hunter.  Yeah.  It's like, come on, dude, what are you doing?  He likes that shit.  He's an adventurer, but they went after him and he's not, uh, going for, he's not giving  them an apology.  Good for him.  Yeah.  I'm not into that either, but good for him for fucking, I don't think he should apologize.  I don't think he should have done it to begin with, but he shouldn't apologize for it.  If he enjoyed doing it.  I mean, he didn't break any laws.  It's legal and it's, uh, some people do, uh, do enjoy doing it. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  I hate it.  Can we go back Hunter?  No.  Can we go back to handle for a second?  Why?  Alex, uh, VA Bob.  He tweeted me the real reason every American fear is meeting handle.  Look at this picture.  It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a God, it's a nudist beach.  And this couple's walking down the beach.  White couple can't be, I don't know if it's Photoshop, but it's white couples walking down  the beach.  It probably isn't past the black guy who is look at the white guys.  Oh, the black guy has a horse penis and the white guy has just like, yeah, it's probably 
[03:26:30]  normal size.  I don't know, but that's a Photoshop.  You think?  Of course it is.  How tall was this fucking Sasquatch?  The guy's eight two.  Look at how much bigger this guy is.  Yeah, but he could be, uh, closer.  No.  Force, uh, I think.  Force perspective.  You know what?  It could be Photoshop, but you know what?  That happens in the real world.  That is, don't get me wrong. 
[03:27:00]  That's his real big delicious, that's his BBC, but big black cock.  However, here you go.  I think that's a fun thing.  That's funny.  That's a big donger.  White guy is not packing much.  Hey, man.  As he walks by with his chicken naked.  I'd love to see her fucking that though, wouldn't you?  No.  Would you want to see him fucking that chick?  No.  While her husband jerks off and watches?  What's the matter with you guys?  Oh, God, no.  You don't know how to have fun.  That's your problem.  Oh, I think that's a real picture. 
[03:27:30]  No, I think it's absolutely a Photoshop.  Because the size of the guy is just too big.  Yeah.  He's like a giant man.  Who is that?  Like his height, not his dick size.  His dick is massive.  That's, uh, yeah.  I don't know.  It is literally a horse cock.  Yeah.  Word.  Jiminy Cricket.  Should we get the fuck out of here?  Yes, we should.  This weekend, Uncle Vinny's, if you happen to be in Point Pleasant,  it's, uh, Friday, Saturday only.  Go to UncleVinny'sComedyClub.com.  And next, Thursday through Sunday, here in New York at Caroline's March 29 through April 1. 
[03:28:00]  Kenny?  I got breaking news, an important update.  I don't want to leave the listeners hanging.  Yeah.  You're resigning?  33 people like me on Facebook since my last appearance.  Yay!  Good to see you, Kenny!  Yeah.  So let's get the numbers up, folks.  6,000 people would beg to differ.  Beg to differ.  Now 6,000.  He sure told him.  33.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's pretty deep.  And stay tuned for the Busy Buddy show with Sam and Troy. 
[03:28:30]  Busy Buddy.  Troy, uh, it's going down today?  I guess so, if Kenny says so.  Yeah, there are two guys who like to talk shit.  You did that already.  You already did that one.  Yeah, but it's a good one.  Yeah.  It's not a good one.  That was the best one he came up with.  Yep.  Yeah.  It was really good.  It wasn't very good.  We're two guys that like to jaw at each other.  Oh, shit.  Oh.  He meant suck cock.  No, I didn't.  Oh.  He goes, oh.  Oh. 
[03:29:00]  It's so funny when we're out and Kenny tells them, like, you know, sometimes people think  we're a couple of queers.  Like, I'll say to the lady, like, you know, we're just friends or we're just out.  And Kenny will go, yeah, people think we're a couple of queers.  What do they do?  What can they do?  It's just uncomfortable.  My new one I'm working on, it's like, yeah, we're like Jay Edgar and Clyde Tolson.  Oh, that is a good one.  Except he said Jay Tolson and Clyde Edgar.  Yeah, I'm working on it. 
[03:29:30]  By the way, as we wrap up, I saw that movie.  DiCaprio was fantastic.  And so was Arnie Hammer.  He was good?  I liked it a lot more than I thought I would.  Oh, you know what?  Your tweets about that fucking extremely loud was hilarious.  Oh, thank you.  That movie.  Oh, yeah.  Stunk.  CM Punk liked the tweets.  Yes, I actually wrote him back.  I didn't know he had written me because I wasn't looking at Twitter for the last day.  You just didn't like that movie?  It was the Tom Hanks, 9-11 fucking kid with the Asperger's or something.  Fuck that little douche and his dumb ass burgers.  Fuck him.  They were hoping that movie was going to be huge. 
[03:30:00]  Stunk.  Sandra Bullock was also really good.  And Hanks was good.  It's still very hard to fucking make a movie about that subject matter.  But it didn't move me.  Couldn't they have done the whole movie if it was another tragedy besides 9-11 or no?  Yes.  But Hanks was the lucky one because he died without having to fucking hang out with that  kid.  Read Jimmy's tweets from yesterday.  They were really funny on the whole thing.  Drove me nuts.  Yeah, CM Punk did enjoy one.  I was jealous.  Why were you jealous?  You could enjoy my tweets too.  Well, I do enjoy your tweets, but I don't enjoy CM Punk enjoying your tweets. 
[03:30:30]  Why?  I like CM.  Do you want to talk to him or something?  I'll arrange that.  I would love to talk to him.  Ah, yeah.  Yeah, Mario.  Bye, guys.  I want to see a great new shooting video I put up.  It's on O-P-A-N-T-X-M on YouTube.  What makes it good?  Because I have multiple camera angles and I'm completely blasting apart targets.  And at one point, I start dual wielding.  I have a pistol in each hand and I'm just going bam, bam, bam, bam, bam. 
[03:31:00]  It's fucking, it looks psychopathic.  But, oh, good one, Jimmy.  Very cool.  Check it out.  See you guys.  See you tomorrow.  You've heard about it.  You've waited four long hours for it.  Finally, the moment is at hand.  After Opie and Anthony live is coming up.  Next!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues. 
[03:31:30]  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Welcome to the Busy Buddy Show with Sam and Troy.  And now, here's the host of the show.  Sam, but where's Troy?  I don't know, Busy Buddy.  Why don't you find out? 
[03:32:00]  You seem to be all involved in everybody else's business here on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Hey, I got 33 more people liking me on Facebook.  That's what it's all about at the end of the day, isn't it?  Yeah, I need to be liked.  You do.  It's just a little thing you have.  You need to feel appreciated.  I have very low self-esteem and no self-worth.  Were they surprised that I threw the meeting out of the studio?  No, this is your hour.  I hope that people realize that.  Yeah, who did they think they were fucking with?  Opie, Anthony, and Jim were meeting with some of the management, and they were starting to bleed into my time. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah, heavy, heavy discussions going on.  Hey, Sam, it was brought up about the O&A Channel logo.  What about it?  Was it brought up today?  On the air?  Yeah.  You mean the stickers?  Yeah, the logo.  Yeah, that was brought up today, that they said they were going to get stickers, because you see we have a glass studio,  and stickers lie on the outside of the studio that have the Opie and Anthony Show logo.  Now, they were transparent stickers before, which meant that from the inside of the studio, the logo, when you looked at it, was backwards. 
[03:33:00]  So they said, what we're going to do is get stickers that are both sides.  Double sides.  Right.  That way you'll see the logo right side, no matter which way you look at it.  They didn't mention to Opie and Anthony that those stickers would have a dark, black, bold background,  leaving a giant black strip covering the studio, impairing vision, and therefore today, the first thing Opie did when he got back from his vacation. 
[03:33:30]  That's not named names.  The first thing, and I was so happy to hear it.  It was like, finally he's back.  The first thing Opie did when he got back on the air was demand that Iraq go outside and tear, literally tear the stickers off the wall, and then shove them back up there.  Now, Kenny, I also noticed.  Wait, wait, there's another part of the story.  Oh, please.  So now the employees are, like, walking by and they see, like, that logo and the stickers, like, all skashad. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah, they're all ripped up and smushed and pressed back against the glass.  So they're like, like, everybody's, like, looking, like, what happened?  I told them it was vandals.  Who'd you tell that to?  Well, that's the employees.  And they go, in this building?  Because, you know, there's security guards everywhere.  They believe you.  Yeah, yeah.  They go, I go, yeah, this is a bad neighborhood.  I go, but it didn't happen on my watch.  Don't besmirch my reputation.  And they just take your word for it.  Oh, yeah, so that's the buzz now.  Another, you know, because I love starting rumors.  You do.  It's cool.  You make up shit off the top of your head. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah, and then it gets back to you, and I know it's just, you know.  Because there's something in your DNA that doesn't allow you to smile.  Like, you just keep a straight face constantly.  I don't know if it's just not a lot going on up in your brain.  I don't know what it is, but it's the same idea of you calling pharmacists doctors without laughing.  I would laugh out loud if I did that.  It's nonsense.  Yeah.  And it just keeps you amused, but you won't show any sign of that amusement. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah, don't talk now.  Why?  Because the intern's in here?  Yeah, I don't know who this is.  You want to introduce yourself to Kenny?  You're one of the Ron and Fez interns.  Yeah, my name is Dan.  I'm a Ron and Fez intern.  See?  You're going to be okay with Dan.  Okay.  I did notice your OCD was kicking in.  One of the other stickers that was left on, on the sidewall, was peeled off.  And Eric just kind of smashed it back on.  And you had to go outside and smooth out all the wrinkles on the sticker.  It needs to be smoothed more because there's air bubbles.  Yeah, you don't like that. 
[03:35:30]  So I told them they got to, like, get a ruler and, like, peel it back a little bit.  And then, like, smooth it with the rulers to get all the air bubbles out.  Why don't you just leave the air bubbles in?  No, because it's not a right thing, Sam.  No?  No, why?  No.  You know, if a person makes a mistake, they got to step up and admit their mistake because people respect honesty.  Is that E-Rock?  No, I'm not, you know.  I'm going to get back out to this meeting, though.  I don't want to.  You think, I mean, you kind of were, you're probably a part of it because they're talking about Cleveland. 
[03:36:00]  And you didn't bring up Cleveland, but you had a lot to do with the conversation today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it seems like.  Yeah.  So stay tuned, people.  Yeah.  I guess I don't know if we're doing the Cleveland show or not at this point.  Keep your fingers crossed.  Do you want to do it?  I'm going regardless.  Right.  Because you're going with Jim.  Jim.  Yeah.  Don't get this twisted, by the way.  Regardless, Jim is doing his special in Cleveland.  Yeah.  It has nothing to do with that.  Yeah.  We're just trying to figure out whether or not we're actually going to be doing this live show 
[03:36:30]  that we said we were going to do from Cleveland because Opie has become.  Don't touch that.  Fairly sour on it.  And Anthony is not pleased at all with what's going on either.  And I know that's what they're talking about now.  At least I think it is.  That's what they were when I had to kick their asses out of my studio.  Yeah.  And I'm taking this time to talk on the Busy Buddy show.  I'm filling in for Troy, I guess.  Where is Troy?  I don't know.  He should be in here.  Because I thought, I'm like, listen, you know, if you're saying we've got to start this, 
[03:37:00]  Opie and Anthony are saying we've got to start this, and the fans are behind it,  maybe it's what this evolves into.  I don't know.  I mean, I don't think it's going to work.  And here he is, ladies and gentlemen, the co-host of the Busy Buddy show with Sam and Troy.  It's Troy Kwan.  All right.  Now there's three of us.  Let's take a vote.  We'll start with you, Troy.  Do you think this is a good idea?  The Busy Buddy show?  Yeah.  I don't care.  Right.  I'm cool either way.  I'll say no, then.  Are you passionate about doing this?  No. 
[03:37:30]  Okay, neither am I.  I'd like to just come here, talk some shit on your show, and then get the fuck out.  Good is good.  Yeah.  That's two nothing, then, so far.  No, no.  You have to take responsibility of your actions.  I'll take responsibility for my actions, but I don't need my own show.  And you certainly wouldn't call it the Busy Buddy show.  No, and plus you should get credit where credit is due.  What do you mean?  Like, put your name on it and be, you know.  Why'd I have to do that?  He's not even in here every day.  The days that he's in here doing some shit, he always gets...  It's not the same with Kelly Ripa anymore.  And his name isn't in the show anymore. 
[03:38:00]  It's not?  No.  It's Live with Kelly.  And guess what?  When a guest host comes in, when Mario Lopez comes in to host with Kelly, it's still just  called Live with Kelly.  I saw that broad he was married to and cheated on.  Allie Landry or Larder.  The Doritos girl.  Yeah.  Yeah, she was here on Thursday, I think.  That's hysterical.  You like that?  Well, I don't like girls.  What?  What?  It's kind of weird in here.  Yeah. 
[03:38:30]  I had to kick them out of the studio, all the talent and management that's meeting outside.  They're still out there arguing about something.  I know.  I had to tell them to get out of here, because these mics were turning on regardless.  By the way, big news, which was talked about at the end of the show, the Lonely Virgil  Tumblr is officially launched.  It's officially good to go.  Congratulations.  Congratulations.  And it's at lonelyvirgil.tumblr.com.  Another Sam and Troy production.  Of course, there is no E in Tumblr. 
[03:39:00]  It's T-U-M-B-L-R.  But people should know that by now.  And you're both on Instagram.  That's right.  Yeah.  I mean, I...  Troy Kwan on Instagram.  Yeah.  You both have Facebook pages.  You both have Twitter.  But the key is going to be for everybody to get involved with this Lonely Virgil thing.  If you see Virgil at a convention near you, take a photo and send it in.  It's hilarious.  And never feel bad for him.  Yeah.  But he knows that nobody's going to go to his tables.  Sam's wearing a plaid shirt.  Troy's wearing a striped shirt. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah.  I'm going to turn off your mic, because I can't hang up on you.  He does convention after convention.  You know what I mean?  He's going to be in your town.  I went with you to one of those things.  Take a picture of him with no one at his table.  You went to a convention?  Yeah, with you.  Which one was that?  Chiller Theater?  Yeah.  Did you have fun?  Oh, yeah.  Your son was there.  Yeah.  He didn't have it.  He thought it was lame.  No, he didn't understand.  He had girls to bang or something.  Yeah, he's 18.  He's like, what the fuck am I doing here?  You've got to throw some cock around.  Your son?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, he practices safe sex. 
[03:40:00]  I think they're getting ready to go, Kenny, so he should probably head out.  I should do my duty?  Yeah, he should probably get out of here.  He's just saying that, Sam.  He was just helping the show.  E-Rock, the sex man, are you excited about this Lonely Virgil project?  Yeah, I'm putting it up on our Facebook right now.  Oh, you are?  On Facebook.  That's great.  And later it'll be up, hopefully, if you're nice, on Club Soda Kenny on Facebook.  You're going to start advertising the Lonely Virgil thing?  I have a bit of a stockpile of pictures, so I'll be able to update it here and there.  But I'm really going to be counting on listener submission.  This is one of those internet projects. 
[03:40:30]  It's not about me.  It's the Lonely Virgil project.  Eric, your house looked very nice, by the way.  Thank you, Kenny.  Eric posted some pictures on his private Facebook of his new house with all the new carpeting  and everything over the weekend.  It did look nice.  I almost called you Virgil.  Eric.  It's getting there.  You were pissed then.  You met Virgil.  Oh, I hate that dude.  How did you...  Well, remember the first time?  I don't know.  Maybe I didn't tell.  The first time, I think I was with you.  We were at Chiller Theater.  Yeah.  And that's where I saw him for the first time, and that's where I saw him doing the hustle 
[03:41:00]  where the photo was $20, $25.  Oh, that'll be $30.  No, you said $20.  No, no, no.  I said $25 for the signature.  No, no, no.  You said $20, and then that would also include an autograph.  No, it's $20 for the picture, $15 for the autograph, $35 for the picture.  Well, I don't want the autograph.  I just wanted the photo.  It's already signed, my friend.  It's already signed.  Then you keep it.  I'm paying you $20.  That's all you're getting.  All you got is $20?  That's all I got.  Yeah, we do it for $20.  But if you got $35, we usually charge $35.  Yeah, I don't have any more money.  For the V-Man, Virgil. 
[03:41:30]  You want me to get you guys a table at the next convention?  No.  Why not?  Because I'm making fun of a guy for not having anyone come to his table to get a signed autograph.  No, you'll have people.  Why would I want to be a guy not having anyone come to my table?  You'll have people there.  Will you get all your Facebook followers to go?  More.  More than $6,000?  Mine, yours, Troy's.  I think they're all the same people.  There's just less of them.  Why is he just holding the headphones up to his head?  Because he's a moron. 
[03:42:00]  I was listening to Eric.  Yeah, but he's not talking anymore.  He's a moron.  He's a dumb guy.  You know that, Troy.  Hey, they're getting ready to get going, Kenny.  Got me twice.  He got you again, didn't he?  Kenny loves to start shit.  This whole thing that's going on, I didn't know it was going to carry on to today.  The Cleveland thing?  No, no, no.  Just the whole busy buddy thing.  Oh, yeah, it's just so stupid, too.  Because, Kenny, literally, I'm telling you guys, and I think we've talked about this before.  I believe in you guys.  That he makes up a rumor in his head, usually during the afternoon. 
[03:42:30]  And then he comes in in the morning, and that's his thing for the day.  It's four sentences total that he talks to everyone he can find about.  And that's it.  Yeah.  That's all.  And then he has everybody believing some sort of bullshit.  Because they don't know he's a moron.  I think they're catching on now.  I would hope so, but...  I'm very well-liked around here.  By who?  The mashups.  They're not the brightest set of hosts.  You know that.  Covino and Rich.  Again, half of that is the mashups. 
[03:43:00]  It's not, you know, a brain trust.  The fist people down the end of the hall.  Who's the fist people?  You know.  Oh, the Howard Stern crew?  Yeah.  The crew from the Howard Stern channel?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  I want to know what the...  How...  This is the longest conversation...  Ron and Fez.  ...that Opie, Anthony, and Jim have had with management at some time.  I hope we go to Cleveland.  I guess it's like a field trip for us.  You like that?  Yeah.  You ever been there, Troy?  To Cleveland?  I've played Cleveland a couple times, yeah.  Cleveland rocks.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Do you think they're going to make us share rooms?  Of course. 
[03:43:30]  Are they going to, Kenny?  Go to Cleveland?  No.  Are they going to make us share rooms?  Hey, look.  What goes on behind closed doors is none of my business.  Why would they do that?  They're not going to make us share rooms.  No, no.  I got a good deal.  How many rooms?  No, listen.  All right.  Let's call roommates.  Because we're going to end up sharing rooms.  I didn't have to for WonderCon Radio, but I'm sure we're going to have to share rooms.  Yeah, but you didn't go with anybody else.  Huh?  You didn't go with anybody else.  What do you mean?  There were six of us there.  Oh, from here. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, it was a whole channel.  Gotcha.  Yeah.  And you had your own rooms?  Yeah, we had our own rooms.  At Foxwood's Casino, we had our own rooms.  Yeah, you're right.  Don't worry.  Okay, let's say.  Closet homo.  If we...  What the fuck is that supposed to mean?  You want it to be a self-fulfilling prophecy that you share a room with Troy.  I don't even know where you're coming.  Who do we bunk up with?  I'm going to call dibs with Roland.  Why would you...  That's a punishment.  Why would you call dibs with Roland?  No, no, no, no.  Because room service will be awesome. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah, but the flatulence won't.  Yeah, I'll suffer with it.  Yeah, it makes sense who would be the roommates.  So you think it's going to be Travis and Danny?  Yeah.  Me and you?  Yeah.  Roland and Eric?  Yeah.  Roland, come here.  Come here.  Can you see me?  Come in here.  Roland.  Roland.  He's waiting for them to finish the meeting.  Yeah, he's spying.  Come here.  Roland, we're discussing if...  We don't know for sure.  Yes.  First of all, we don't even know if this Cleveland trip is happening anymore. 
[03:45:00]  If the Cleveland trip happens...  Who do you want to room with?  Who do you room with?  Hmm.  Because we don't know.  We might have individual rooms, but I doubt it.  Fuck that.  Really?  I mean, maybe I got spoiled from WonderCon Radio.  You got spoiled.  Who do you think you would end up rooming with?  Primetime Sam Roberts.  See?  This is what I'm talking about.  You know what?  Eric just said, no brainer, I call Roland.  Eric called you as his roommate.  No, but it depends on... 
[03:45:30]  See, I don't think they're going to let us pick, though.  I think they're going to go, hey, Sam.  Hey, Sam.  You and Troy, or me and Eric.  They're not going to do that.  Because all we do is just walk out of the other room and go to the room.  It's a song, Everybody Wants You, because Sam is in big command.  Eric, Eric, don't queue up the song.  No, but...  First of all, it's not even a song.  No, but I think they're going to go...  Yes, it is.  No, they're going to go, hey, you and Eric are roommates, and then they'll probably go,  hey, Sam, you and Troy are going to be the...  Eric, turn off the song.  We're not even talking about it.  It has nothing to do with what we're talking about.  But I think they'll pick it up for us. 
[03:46:00]  The Busy Buddy Show plays music.  I don't care what Kenny's waving.  We're not talking about people wanting me.  Do you know what?  I take that back.  I will do room with Eric, though.  Well...  Do you know why?  Why?  Two words that we understand that you may not understand.  Room service.  That's right, bitch.  That's what Eric was talking about.  That's what I'm talking about.  But Eric doesn't understand the gas...  Licking sandwiches, chocolate milk...  The gas emissions, the shit toxins, all these horrible things that would be coming from  that room.  Oh, well, open the door and you can smell it down the hall.  All right, Troy, here's what we're going to do. 
[03:46:30]  If even it does happen.  We're going to hang out.  Hey, you want one bed?  You want a king bed or two beds, Sam?  If I'm with Troy?  Yeah.  We just do a king bed, it's fine, right?  Yeah.  We can get room.  Assuming we spend a night there.  I guess we would spend one or two nights there.  One.  One night there.  If.  What I want to do...  Roland...  We got to get Roland all fucked up.  We got to try to get Eric a little drunk, too, but definitely get Roland all fucked up.  Yeah, bad things happen.  And then what we do is we go up to their room and we just sit in there and see how much 
[03:47:00]  room service can be ordered in one session.  Oh, man, that's dangerous.  How great would that be?  I have a feeling that...  Because remember when we did Foxwoods, the fans were just buying us drinks.  I was fucking loaded.  Oh, so you're going to be all fucked up, too.  Oh, I'm planning on it.  All right, I'm going to try to get you to start molesting E-Rock, then.  Molesting?  Molesting.  In a drunken state.  Sam, I took Troy out for barbecue for the first half of the deal.  You didn't get him in the handy, though?  We ate a lot of barbecue.  So you couldn't, what, ejaculate after that?  Well, I just didn't. 
[03:47:30]  I wasn't really ready for a handjob.  We ate a lot of barbecue and I took him to the donut heaven.  For those that don't know, Roland was...  Last I checked, before I left for Anaheim, Roland was in debt to Troy for one barbecue meal  and buying him a handjob.  Not performing one for him.  Going to a massage parlor that performs handjobs.  Right.  And I took care of the barbecue.  And so...  And I wasn't stingy, either.  So far...  Because some people think I'm stingy. 
[03:48:00]  No, Roland hooked me up.  I don't think...  No, no, no.  You've never been stingy with food.  Yeah.  And then I went to donuts.  Took him to the donut heaven, donut planet.  He hooked you up with some donuts, too?  He hooked me up with some donuts.  And I didn't even ask.  Who's on the phone?  I don't know.  Just a caller.  But he doesn't...  He still owes you the handjob.  Yeah.  Donuts don't take the place of the handjob.  No, no, no, no.  I said, do you know what?  He goes, I don't want a donut.  I go, do you know what?  Take these four donuts.  That's what he does.  Roland likes to...  What does he want to say, the caller?  He wants to say, shut the fuck up, Kenny.  That's what he wants to say.  I just want to... 
[03:48:30]  Kenny, I think they're getting ready to go.  Oh, got me again, Sam.  That's Troy.  That's Troy, man.  Come on.  Take the call.  You know what we should do?  What?  In Cleveland, is have one room be the shit room.  So we don't all have rooms that smell like shit.  Like, if you have to take a shit, you knock on Roland and Eric's door and say, can I use  your shitter?  You just know the toxins that will become...  Look at Kenny go.  Uh-huh.  I have to pitch him a guest.  Yes, pitch him. 
[03:49:00]  Did it...  It looked like it ended in a rush.  That looked like it ended ugly.  Yeah.  Roland should not be pitching guests right now.  Eric, you know the show.  Yeah, but let him go out there because he may hear some stuff that we don't know.  But he shouldn't be...  He's not going to get any yeses on anyone right now.  No, but he also will try to run in an attempt to pitch a guest but hear everything that's  going on.  Are we going to Cleveland, Sal?  I don't think we're going.  I just...  You don't think so?  Well, that just ended really weird.  It was a quick...  Like, get the fuck away.  Like, fuck you. 
[03:49:30]  I'm out of here.  That's the vibe you caught?  Yeah.  Fuck, man.  That sucks, man.  I was really excited about that.  Yeah?  Because Cleveland, I mean...  Like, Cleveland's ready to party, I think.  I don't know.  I mean, what else is going on in Cleveland?  I mean, I also...  I mean, I don't...  I just took a red-eye back from Anaheim to do the show, so I'm not really thinking  about how much I want to travel again.  Yeah, but it's like a month away.  I guess that's true.  You recoup.  How long is a flight...  Yeah, I'm recouped.  I'm already recouped.  Dude, it's got to be like an hour and a half flight.  Big deal.  All right.  So that's not bad. 
[03:50:00]  No.  And they're ready to fucking rage out there.  Who is?  We went out...  Which in Cleveland.  Who are we going to see in Cleveland?  People, they're just ready to fucking party.  There's not a lot going on out there.  So Opie and Anthony rolls through.  It's time to fucking rage.  Are you going to set up a gig or something for that night?  I don't know if there's any clubs out there.  This is a smart idea.  Any bars or any clubs?  What you should do, and this is me thinking for you, Troy, is set up a gig of like, you  know, you can come to the ONA thing in the morning or in the afternoon whenever we're  doing it, if we're even going out there, and then at night, I'm going to be doing a 
[03:50:30]  party and all the ONA fans come check me out.  Yeah, that'd be great.  So if anybody knows any bars or clubs in the Cleveland area, get at me, Troy Kwan on Twitter.  And celebrity guest DJs get paid pretty well for appearances, don't they?  Celebrity guest would, but I mean, I don't know where that fits into this conversation.  But you know what's cool, though, is actually the week before, I'll be playing with Jason  Ellis here in New York City.  Is that right?  At Rebel.  Yeah, Death, Death, Die.  So I'll be DJing with the Jingleberries again and DJing the after party. 
[03:51:00]  How's everybody's brackets doing?  I don't know.  I tried to log in, and I couldn't figure out where I was.  All right, let's...  Where I'm standing as far as...  Because the host just...  Because Ant went home sick, and Opie was on vacation.  So I don't think the hosts are in the bracket tournament anymore.  We're doing...  We were...  We were trying to do the ONA brackets, brackets, brackets.  Somebody's still going to win the $1,000.  We've still got the contest going.  So I don't see why we shouldn't check this.  Let me check it right now.  It's at SiriusXM.com slash hoops.  It's too late to enter, because obviously the final four... 
[03:51:30]  Or not the...  You know, the NCAA tournament already started.  I'm going to log in here.  I'm not going to say my password on the air, though, because I'm not going to Rich Voss this  thing up and have you screwing up my brackets, all of you out there.  If you want to follow along, Troy, did you sign up for the brackets?  No, I forgot, dude.  What a fucking asshole.  Eric, what's your team name?  I just found where I'm located.  I'm doing horrible.  What's your team name so people can follow you?  The B Sharps.  I love that.  It's from the Simpsons record.  Sal, you're not on this thing, are you? 
[03:52:00]  Nope.  I am the Daniel Bryans, and that's Bryans with a Y.  Let me click this thing.  So it's the B Sharps, the Daniel Bryans.  Who else is in this thing from the staff?  Is Troy's not in it, right?  No.  I think Roland's in it, too.  Do you know what his team name is?  Oh, I think it's Real Dick in the Ass.  Somebody took Dick in the Ass.  That's fair.  How many...  Oh, my God.  What place are you in? 
[03:52:30]  Me?  It says status, and then a number.  Let's see.  Hold on.  Not good.  What place?  It's the number on the left here?  Is that the...  Yeah, the rank.  Okay.  2,452.  I'm beating you.  Oh, wow.  I'm at 17,704.  I'm probably dead last at this.  I'm beating you.  This is huge.  Okay.  I gotta see my brackets, because people...  When we were hanging out doing the WonderCon thing over the weekend,  everybody was paying attention to the games because they were following along with their 
[03:53:00]  brackets at home.  I don't remember which teams I picked in my brackets, so I couldn't follow along at all.  Oh, I got a lot of losses here.  Yeah, I just pretty much copied Norm MacDonald's brackets that he posted on Twitter.  I just did the same exact thing.  Well, my problem is my teams were losing early.  I can't believe that Syracuse has managed to squeak by all these teams.  Syracuse is my one team that's still actually doing all right. 
[03:53:30]  Travis, what's your bracket name?  Dr. Gay.  Dr. Gay, of course.  Yeah, I can't believe that Syracuse is still in this thing.  That's good for me.  That's good for you, yeah.  We're still doing the contest, right?  Yeah.  What are you ranked?  I think 17,704.  Yeah, overall, 17,704th place.  You're doing better than me.  Really?  Yeah.  Where are you?  1894.  Oh, how does it feel, Travis?  I'm going to get the $1,000.  It's the beauty of March Madness, right? 
[03:54:00]  I love it.  Who knows what's going to happen?  I love it.  Let me look at the full thing.  I want to see.  Oh, boy.  Okay.  I'm like 20,000 overall.  Only two, only one of my Final Four teams is out.  That's good.  Connecticut didn't make it.  Wow.  Connecticut didn't make it far at all.  Connecticut didn't make it past the third round, and I had them in the Final Four.  Not a great pick.  Travis.  Yes, Ari.  On the right-hand side, it says best possible, and it has a number.  Is that the most I can get out of my total bracket, or for that round? 
[03:54:30]  That's as many points as you can have total.  Okay.  At the end of the thing.  Yeah.  So, like, once you lose a team, it lowers.  Sure, yeah.  This is all at SiriusXM.com slash hoops, but I would hope that you've already entered, because  I want to find out which one of you.  If you haven't, then.  You can't.  No.  Wait, that would be so unfair.  Troy, the little schmuck, forgot to do it.  Troy's a busy guy.  Yeah, right.  Yeah.  What's he doing?  You know what I was doing?  Why?  I was eating those new Taco Bell, Dorito tacos.  Oh.  I saw his Instagram last night. 
[03:55:00]  I was really good.  Have you tried them?  No, I don't have a Taco Bell around me.  Do you?  Really?  Yeah.  I got to go.  We go to Long Island every Saturday for a thing for my daughter.  There's a Taco Bell right there.  Might have to have a little Taco Bell breakfast.  Yeah.  What do you do for your daughter in Long Island?  Ballet.  Nice.  You ever get in on that yourself?  No.  I think you'd be a hell of a dancer.  I'm resisting the urge, because it's mostly, like, two-year-olds.  Yeah.  And I don't want to make it about me.  I want to let her have her thing.  She gets one hour a week, so, you know.  Oh.  And Roland.  I picked UNLV to go pretty far, because that's where Roland went. 
[03:55:30]  He should have told me they don't play basketball well.  Duke.  I had Connecticut and Duke.  My whole, whatever this is, West, not West, but whatever that bracket is that Duke and Connecticut  and UNLV, that whole, Notre Dame, that whole thing is fucked up for me.  That's gone.  Um, yeah.  My South bracket is destroyed.  My East is not doing well, because with Linsanity, I had Harvard going pretty far. 
[03:56:00]  Oh, just based on the fact that a player who was good for a week went there?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  And I, again, I guess lightning did strike just the one time.  Yep.  Not twice.  Uh, Gonzaga, also not the powerhouse I thought they were, um, which is a shame.  Who knew Temple wasn't going to make it anywhere?  Because that's fucking up my Midwest brackets.  Yeah, that fucked mine up, too.  And I thought Georgetown was, like, a famous school.  They lost.  This is the best sports break I've ever heard on this.  I thought you can't go wrong with picking Georgetown. 
[03:56:30]  Everybody likes Georgetown, right?  They're good at football.  So how did you pick your brackets?  Me?  Yeah.  Eh, you know.  You guessed.  Lots of, lots of, uh, lots of favorites and a few upsets that didn't pan out.  Your upsets haven't panned out.  I don't think so, no.  Right now, I feel like Syracuse is an upset team because they lost Mello, not Carmelo, but  that, you know.  What's his name?  Flo Mello?  Yeah, the guy who's too stupid to play basketball.  Everybody, all, all the Syracuse people I know are on Facebook and stuff. 
[03:57:00]  We're all posting pictures of him in dunce caps and just saying horrible things about  him.  But Syracuse.  You think he feels like an idiot?  Yeah.  I would hope so.  He is one.  So I would hope so.  Literally.  Yeah.  He's a moron.  But I got Michigan State and Syracuse in the NCAA finals.  It could still happen.  They're both still in this thing.  Travis, are we going to Cleveland?  I think so.  You think so?  You're not sure?  My gut says yes.  My mind is telling me no.  But I don't think... 
[03:57:30]  But my body!  You're excited about it, right?  About what?  Going to Cleveland.  Sure.  Are we going to have to bunk up?  No.  I've heard no.  Oh, because we were just talking on the air about who's going to be in which room.  I mean, look, if they hear that you're open to bunking up...  No, we're not.  We're not.  I also was clear to mention that when I was traveling for WonderCon radio in Anaheim, we  were not bunking up.  No, I don't think they bunk up around here.  Good.  Because we're adults.  But if you want, I mean, you know...  It's kind of shitty if they make you bunk up. 
[03:58:00]  Well, then it actually is a field trip.  It's not like grown-ups going on a business trip anymore.  Yeah, but wouldn't part of you almost want to share a room with Eric or Roland just to  have the stories?  I kind of want to have us all in one room.  Just all of us in one room?  Part of me, I want there to be like, we get one room, two queen beds, and four cots.  No, two queen beds, three cots, and the bathtub.  I would do that.  And just see what happens.  For one night?  Why not?  Just see what happens.  I don't see that going well.  Which one would you get? 
[03:58:30]  What would I get?  Which bed?  I'd fight for the bed bed.  No, but I mean, you'd have to share a bed.  Yeah, because that's a risk.  I would go for a cot.  Nobody's going to try to jump in a cot with me.  I could do a cot, no problem.  But somebody will try to avoid sleeping in the bathtub, and they'll jump in the queen  bed with you.  Well, you know who would jump in a bed with somebody else the first?  Eric, from the cuddle story.  Remember, Eric would try to cuddle someone.  I was going to say Roland, because he doesn't give a shit.  Right.  Yeah, you're probably right.  Eric would probably want a cuddle partner.  Eric, do you have trouble sleeping at night without a cuddle partner? 
[03:59:00]  Just based on Troy's story of when him and four other guys fucked this girl one after  the other, and then they walked in on you cuddling with her.  That's what that's based on.  Do you have trouble sleeping?  No, I wasn't with the same girl.  I don't believe that.  Do you have trouble sleeping without a cuddle partner?  No, I'm fine.  Would you?  Do you think Eric travels with one of those cuddle pillows?  Yeah, he travels with one of those Japanese man pillows.  He's got his own man pillow. 
[03:59:30]  Do you have a man pillow, Eric?  No, but I would happily take one if he got it for me.  It's actually a Macho King wrestling buddy.  Yes.  And then sometimes if he can't sleep, he has a match with it.  He wrestles him, by the way.  Do you think he has like a little scorecard like next to his bed about who's won how many  matches?  Yeah, so far.  This one's for you, Macho.  He's up, but Macho is close.  Yeah, he's a good booker like that.  He keeps the audience interested.  It wouldn't be fun if Eric won every time.  No.  How would you feel, Eric, about that sort of competition where one hotel room and two 
[04:00:00]  queen beds, three cots, and the bathtub?  No, I would take a cot.  You would take the cot?  I would take a cot.  Would you worry about like a collapsing situation?  Oh, I get it.  Because of a weight issue?  Oh, I shouldn't have even said that.  Why would you take the cot?  I would take the cot because one, I don't want to share a bed with Roland because I've  seen him in the office.  Everybody is convinced that Roland will try to share a bed with someone.  But not only is he gassy. 
[04:00:30]  He spoons someone.  He thinks it would be hysterical.  Not only is he gassy, but he drools and sometimes he has accidents.  Sometimes he has accidents?  He'll wake up and go, oh, oh, oh, and then he'll run away and then I won't see him for  a half an hour and then he'll come back and he's like, I shit my pants.  No, no, no.  He hasn't shit his pants here.  He said there's been a couple of times that he's-  He hasn't shit his pants here.  Maybe a little drop, but I doubt there's been real shit.  So would we be running on like real world Jersey Shore rules where like first person in 
[04:01:00]  the hotel room gets to pick what they want?  Well, theoretically, but it's like how much do those rules stick?  Like when you got an alpha male in the house, they're going to be like, no, fuck you.  That's my bed.  So you got to take all that into consideration.  And I'm going to ask both Troy and Travis this question.  What are the odds that Eric gets in one of the cots?  We all know Eric's going to be the first one asleep.  All of us are going to pretend to be asleep because we're all just waiting for Eric to fall 
[04:01:30]  asleep.  What are the odds that he gets wrapped into the cot with cellophane and wheeled out into  the hallway or possibly into an elevator?  What are the odds that that would definitely happen?  Percentage wise?  Yeah.  A hundred.  Yeah.  That'd be the greatest thing I've ever seen in my life.  If we wrapped up Eric in cellophane in his cot and then just push him into the elevator.  Did we do it like Dexter style, like nude wrapped in cellophane?  Definitely.  Okay.  And what we'd do is he'd be struggling to get out of the cellophane.  Meanwhile, we've hit every single floor on the elevator. 
[04:02:00]  They're saying, ding!  I'll open up and see him.  Yep.  It's almost as if they know that reminds me of his wedding.  Sorry.  I'm rooming with some fucking assholes.  Do you remember when we had Bobo sitting in a chair out here and we told him he had to  keep the shirt on his head because he was offending people?  Yes.  And then we wheeled him out into the elevator and we sent him down to the lobby in the  chair.  Well, we were just sick of having him around.  With a fucking shirt on his head. 
[04:02:30]  And then the doors opened and they had to call security.  Everybody's waiting down there to come up to their jobs.  Their boring desk jobs.  Yeah.  Bobo in a chair with a t-shirt on his head.  Those were the days when we had Bobo in.  Yeah.  Eric, do you feel like you'd be the victim of prank wars if we all shared a room such  as being wrapped in cellophane and having your cot wheeled out into the elevator and  having every floor pushed?  Won't happen.  You don't think so?  Do you think Eric would lose it?  How would you stop that from happening? 
[04:03:00]  He would lose an attitude.  I will stab people.  How would you stab people if you're saying you're not going to do shit?  You can if you still have knives on you.  Not if we handcuff you first.  You're not going to have a knife on you, Eric.  All right.  Now this is turning into like a gay snuff film or something like that.  Eric, you're not going to sleep.  You're not going to go.  Wrap me naked, handcuffs.  Listen, Eric, you're not speaking realistically.  Yeah.  You're not going to go to a show event and sleep with a knife.  Show event?  This is the hotel room.  Yeah.  Yeah.  After a show event, you're not going to sleep with a knife in your hand.  We all know that. 
[04:03:30]  You thinks that.  Yes, I thinks that.  You're not going to sleep with a knife in your hand.  Don't, you know.  It might be a stuffed knife.  I don't know.  We'll slip something into his warm milk before bed.  We'll slip a Mickey into his warm milk.  He's going to take his warm milk before bed.  We all have our things before bed.  It's not a big deal, but I like a glass of warm milk.  Do you think Eric sleeps with a knife, Troy?  No.  Do you think he has a knife?  He'd bring a steak knife from home.  He's got a butter knife?  Yeah. 
[04:04:00]  He'd bring one from Outback that we'd eat at first, and then he'd bring a knife over.  No, Eric, how would you combat the cellophane attack?  Not happening.  You know when he goes into his...  Yes, it is going to happen.  No, it's not happening.  He doesn't have any ideas.  You know when he goes into his crazy rage mode where he's like, and his voice goes up a couple octaves and he starts screaming?  When he was yelling at Kenny?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That'll happen again.  Yeah, but he's going to be a guy yelling like a female, wrapped in cellophane, tied to a cot, and in an elevator. 
[04:04:30]  It's not going to have the same effect.  And we're all going to be like, ha, ha, ha, look at the guy who's stuck on his cot, wrapped in cellophane, riding the hotel elevator to every floor in the middle of the night.  I'd love to see it.  You would.  Yeah.  You would.  Well, maybe we'll just have to start breaking into people's rooms.  Even if we're not bunking, which, by the way, now I feel like we should only have one hotel room for the staff. 
[04:05:00]  We should at least have six joining rooms.  Nobody's going to sleep if that happens.  No, and they shouldn't.  There should be survival.  Yeah, this is survival.  I'll go down and sleep by the fucking pool.  You will?  We'll get you by the pool.  We'll get you.  If you try to...  And by the way, that's the worst thing you could possibly do.  If you try to avoid this whole thing from happening, all you're going to do is unify everyone against you.  That's true.  You have to...  You're either in this, or you're either the...  You're the windshield, or you're the bug.  This is like Hunger Games.  Yeah.  And you're hungry as shit. 
[04:05:30]  Well, come get me, motherfucker.  We will.  There's a lot of us.  Yeah.  And we won't tie Eric to his cot at first.  We'll get you first instead.  You ain't going to do shit.  Then after we get you, all that anger, we'll have you get it out by tying up Eric to his cot  and then shoving him up the elevator.  Shoot.  You know who would do that in a second?  Who?  Like, who would get Eric into that cot?  Roland.  Roland.  Roland would actually, like, hold him down.  Roland would be the guy to make it happen.  Roland would sit on Eric to make sure that he can't get up.  Roland, you haven't been hearing anything about what we've been talking about, have you? 
[04:06:00]  A little bit.  We want to.  The goal now is...  I'm going to train for a month and whoever touches me will be the living fuck pole battle.  But will you be on team prank?  Like, will you prank someone else?  Well, you know what I mean?  You don't have to be...  You know, I think the only way this is going to work...  And Eric, maybe you need to start politicking early.  Because if there's a common goal...  Yeah, there's got to be one victim.  Yeah.  And then five guys.  Eric, I'm not saying it has to be you. 
[04:06:30]  You can start politicking now to make sure it's not.  But I am going...  Wasn't there a guy who did a prank with a video and the guy killed himself?  Well, that wasn't a prank.  That was...  That's a major lawsuit.  Yeah.  My bad.  To see...  Secretly filming somebody do something.  That was not at all...  That was not tying Eric up with cellophane and putting him in an elevator.  No.  Oh, you didn't hear about this prank?  No, no, no.  The prank is that Eric, he'll fall asleep first.  And he'll be in a cot.  And we'll get some cellophane. 
[04:07:00]  And we'll tie him to his cot.  And then we'll wheel him out to the elevator and send him up to every floor.  He's a nice sleeper, though.  I mean...  That's why we need you to hold him down while we wrap him up.  I don't know if I can do that, though, because that's cruel, man.  Can we just bring him to the roof and leave him up there?  Oh, yeah, like Hangover.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll be like, where's Eric?  Eric, Hangover's a cool movie.  Yeah, those people are famous now.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  So...  This isn't Hangover.  You can be the Justin Bartha of this Hangover trip.  Okay, who's getting the Tyson tattoo, then? 
[04:07:30]  That would be Troy, obviously.  Troy always does have a very Ed Helms vibe about him.  Yeah.  I don't know if it's the acapella training he has or what it is, but it's just very Ed Helms.  I am going to go to management after this after show and say we really do want to have one room for the whole staff.  Well, here's the problem.  Say, look, we heard...  We have people to go to Cleveland first.  Do you think the Cleveland trip's going to happen?  I don't know.  That's what I said.  I have no idea.  You're still optimistic, Travis.  I'm optimistic, sure.  Okay.  Yeah, because he's a... 
[04:08:00]  He's political.  He's a suit?  You're a suit?  Well, no, because I don't know if a suit...  I smell bacon.  Are you a suit, Travis?  No, look at me.  I'm wearing a hoodie.  Okay, you're a t-shirt, then.  Yeah.  Because...  I just think it'll happen because everybody wants to have fun.  Yeah.  And once they hear about this cot idea, there's no way they're going to say, no, we're not going to Cleveland.  Especially now.  Yeah.  And I'm going to go to management and say, one room, two queens, three cots, and a bathtub.  No...  Just get a presidential suite.  No suite.  No, no, no.  One room. 
[04:08:30]  Say, look, heard about your budget issue.  Yeah.  Here's a quick fix.  Yeah.  Use the rest of the money for security, whatever you need it for.  Hey, I think anybody that's with Troy and myself, we go dark.  We black out.  We go black out.  We black out.  Let's see what happens.  You know what I mean?  Well, yeah, we'll see what fucking happens.  It's going to be ugly.  You're not going to threaten me.  I'm not threatening you.  I'm not fucking scared.  I'm not threatening you.  I'm saying if anybody fucks with me, I'm going to fuck you up.  Yeah, really?  How are you going to do that when you're tied up in cellophane in an elevator?  It's not going to happen.  It's not going to happen.  And we fucking lock your scary ass out. 
[04:09:00]  Eventually, I don't know what happens.  Someone will grab his arm, and the other arm will come swing and pop him.  Eventually, I've got to get let out of that cellophane.  And eventually, I've got to come back here, and I know where you live.  Well, you're going to have to figure that out.  Because we're going to lock you out of the room.  Understand that.  And that's how we roll.  Listen, we'll keep you up to date on what's going on with this tomorrow, when the Opie and  Anthony Show and after Opie and Anthony Live continue.  Stay tuned.  Y'all crazy.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Goodbye.  The Opie and Anthony Show is now over.
